The  study  you  are  about  to  read  is  the  product  of  many  analysts’  research  and  study. 
Those  analysts  are  identified  as  authors  of  the  respective  papers  constituting  the  work.  This  project 
concerns  the  prediction  of  future  United  States  domestic  trends  to  the  year  2015.  It  has  offered  everyone 
an  opportunity  to  think  creatively  and  project  into  the  future.  While  this  is  a  difficult  task,  it  is 
nevertheless  exciting  and  challenging.  We  have  all  learned  and  profited  from  the  experience. 

A  product  of  this  magnitude  cannot  be  accomplished  without  the  assistance  of  many  other 
talented  people  who  are  not  identified  elsewhere.  The  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of 
Congress  has  many  such  talented  people  and  the  editor  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  them 
for  their  many  hours  of  hard  work  and  assistence.  First,  to  David  Cabitto,  our  graphics  artist,  for  his 
skill  in  compiling  the  many  excellent  charts  and  graphs.  The  graphics  add  much  to  the  clarity  of  the 
text.  Next,  to  Marilyn  Majeska  and  her  staff,  for  reading  the  manuscript  and  making  valuable 
suggestions.  Her  skilled  eye  and  careful  reading  are  greatly  appreciated  for  making  the  text  more  lucid 
and  precise.  We  gratefully  acknowledge  the  people  who  helped  with  the  inevitable  complexities  of 
automation,  Steven  Cranton  and  Sara  Arason.  Our  work  was  saved  on  more  than  one  occasion  through 
their  efforts. 

Louis  R.  Mortimer,  Chief  of  the  Federal  Research  Division,  is  to  be  thanked  for  his 
encouragement  and  support  in  this  project.  His  optimism  maintained  many  of  our  spirits  when  they 
might  have  sunk  under  the  weight  of  deadlines. 

Finally,  to  those  people  who  have  assisted  in  other,  no  less  important  ways,  many  thanks.  This 
work  could  never  have  been  accomplished  in  a  timely  fashion  without  their  help.

INTRODUCTION 


It  is  abundantly  clear  to  most  researchers  that  the  United  States  and  the  developed  world  are  well 
into  a  period  of  transition  that  is  generating  a  great  deal  of  turbulence,  both  domestically  and  globally. 
Technology  is  transforming  virtually  every  aspect  of  world  society  and  effecting  changes  in  developmental 
trends.  While  it  is  impossible  to  predict  the  future  with  any  certainty,  it  is  altogether  appropriate  for  the 
U.S.  Army  to  be  concerned  with  future  studies  and  forecasting. 

Twenty-five  years  ago  the  United  States  was  coming  to  grips  with  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964. 
The  population  was  predominantly  white  and  the  principal  minority  group  was  black,  constituting 
approximately  10  percent  of  the  total.  The  percentages  of  the  Asian  and  Hispanic  populations  were  far 
lower.  The  American  economy  towered  over  all  others  in  the  world.  The  dollar  denominated  all 
international  trade,  domestic  oil  production  met  most  of  the  nation’s  needs,  and  American  schools  were 
seeing  the  results  of  the  science  and  mathematics  curriculum  instituted  as  a  result  of  the  launching  of 
Sputnik  in  1957.  Although  the  debate  about  the  involvement  in  Vietnam  was  becoming  increasingly 
strident,  there  was  no  "Vietnam  syndrome"  because  no  one  would  know  the  outcome  of  the  conflict  for 
nine  more  years  and  much  more  time  would  pass  before  Americans  would  formulate  any  general  opinion 
about  it.  In  fact,  in  1966  the  United  States  was  well  into  the  federal  effort  aimed  at  creating  the  "Great 
Society."  Many  of  the  nation’s  citizens  believed  America  could  have  both  guns  and  butter:  the  greatest 
military  machine  and  the  greatest  social  reform  effort  the  world  had  ever  seen. 

During  this  time  the  international  system  was  well  defined  and  predicated  on  the  bi-polar 
confrontation  between  the  two  power  blocs  that  had  emerged  from  World  War  II:  NATO  and  the 
Warsaw  Pact.  The  superpowers  focused  on  Europe  and,  although  the  Cuban  crisis  of  1963  briefly  had 
raised  the  threat  of  escalation,  the  two  forces,  in  the  main,  contested  each  other  in  remote  areas  of  the 
world  through  their  client-states  or  proxies. 

In  1966  the  concept  of  "personal  computing"  was  unknown  because  automation  technology  meant 
the  mainframe  computer  and  "dumb"  terminals.  "Smart"  bombs  and  laser-guided  weapons  were  still  in 
the  idea  stage,  and  planners  would  only  forecast  their  use  in  the  inevitable  conflict  with  the  USSR. 

In  1966  the  futurists  had  their  visions,  but  many  visions  remain  just  that.  In  1991  Americans  are 
not  commuting  to  work  with  jet  packs  strapped  to  their  backs.  People  still  drive  automobiles,  much  to 
the  detriment  of  the  environment.  Cities  have  not  been  encapsulated  under  domes,  and  electricity 
generated  in  nuclear  power  plants  is  not  free  of  charge.  The  great  social  reform  experiment  has  been  re¬ 
evaluated  and  many  Americans  have  mixed  feelings  about  the  Vietnam  experience.  The  Cold  War  may 
have  ended,  not  through  superpower  warfare,  but  because  of  the  seeming  collapse  of  communism  from 
its  own  "inner  contradictions."  Yet  the  world  still  does  not  live  in  peace  and  harmony.  What  happened? 
Palmistry  artists  notwithstanding,  no  one  can  predict  the  future.  Humans  are  limited  to  analyzing  events 
and  identifying  trends  so  that  they  can  be  prepared  for  the  future  and  not  be  too  surprised  at  what  takes 
place. 

The  task  in  this  project  has  been  to  identify  United  States  domestic  trends  for  the  next  25-year 
period,  up  to  the  year  2015,  in  the  following  areas:  demography,  the  economy,  resources,  education, 


1 


society,  technology,  military  science  and  geopolitics  and  threat.  Scenarios  have  been  constructed  with 
potential  variations  for  future  developments  in  these  areas.  Analysts  have  identified  those  factors,  the 
"change  drivers,"  that  will  accelerate  or  retard  the  development  of  these  trends,  and  have  offered  a  range 
of  possibilities  to  assist  U.S.  Army  planners  in  future  decision-making. 

How  has  this  been  accomplished?  Many  excellent  methodologies  exist  for  predicting  future 
trends.  When  a  ballistic  missile  is  fired,  its  future  course  can  be  determined  with  great  precision  by  using 
calculations.  This  predictive  ability  guides  the  aiming  procedure  of  a  mortar  crew  for  the  first  shot.  The 
spotter  provides  guidance  for  future  actions,  that  is,  correction  for  wind,  equipment-based  idiosyncracies, 
etc.,  without  casting  any  doubt  whatsoever  on  the  validity  of  the  basic  theoretical  predictive  formula. 

The  long-term  future  of  the  physical  world  may  be  equally  predictable.  Assuming  the  Big  Bang 
is,  in  fact,  a  valid  model  of  the  universe,  and  reliable  measurements  have  been  made  of  the  amount  of 
matter  in  space  so  one  knows  whether  it  will  collapse  or  expand  forever,  one  can  calculate  with  precision 
just  when  the  universe  will  "recycle"  with  contraction  because  of  gravitational  attraction  of  the  galaxies 
and  calculate  the  time  of  the  next  Big  Bang,  or  when  the  universe  will  reach  a  certain  degree  of  cold- 
expanded  "entropy  death."  Future  measurements  will  either  confirm  one  of  these  outcomes,  or  possibly 
suggest  that  the  predictive  model  is  wrong,  with  implications  that  a  better  predictive  model  may  be 
possible  if  new  measurements  are  taken. 

The  verifiability  of  the  predictive  model  in  the  physical  world  has  been  so  successful  that 
researchers  have  naturally  sought  equally  reliable  methodologies  for  the  prediction  of  social  developments. 
Some  have  even  become  so  pleased  with  results  obtained  so  far  that  they  have  provided  "objective 
methods"  for  the  projection  of  future  developments.  Examples  of  such  methods  are  Rand’s  Delphi 
technique,  forecasting  by  analogy  with  physical  and/or  biological  processes,  and  extrapolation  of  trends. 
There  have  been  some  attempts  to  construct  quantified  structural  mathematical  models  (as  described  by 
J.  P.  Martino,  for  instance).  These  methods  are  frequently  of  considerable  use,  particularly  when 
forecasting  technological  developments  in  a  narrow  area. 

The  fact  remains,  however,  that  the  kind  of  sure  prediction  available  for  measurement  of  events 
in  the  physical  sciences  is  not  available  for  the  social  sciences,  regardless  of  the  sophistication  of  the 
statistical  techniques  used.  The  underlying  basic  processes  in  physics  involve  known,  unambiguous, 
precisely  described  analytical  formulas  (like  the  gravitational  equation  that  describes  both  the  path  of  a 
projectile  and  the  attraction  of  galaxies),  while  social  scientists  have  no  unambiguous  testable  mechanism. 
They  must  rely  on  correlations  between  events.  In  this  case,  trend  extrapolation  is  a  valid  technique,  as 
long  as  forecasters  remember  that  the  reasons  behind  a  trend  may  be  murky  and  that  therefore  the  trend 
may  cease  for  reasons  that  are  not,  in  principle,  unpredictable,  but  which  have  not  yet  been  identified. 
Unless  they  recognize  this  fact,  forecasters  may  easily  misinterpret  the  degree  of  validity  the  trend 
projection  allows.  Of  course,  everyone  wants  to  predict  events  with  maximum  validity,  but  caution  must 
be  exercised  so  as  not  to  fall  prey  to  mechanical  procedures  that  sound  scientific  but  do  not,  in  fact, 
increase  the  validity  of  predictions. 

The  approach  to  the  issue  of  methodology  used  here,  given  the  breadth  of  the  task  (forecasting 


2 


essentially  the  whole  social  and  technological  set  of  changing  conditions  in  the  United  States  within  the 
environment  of  global  change)  and  the  25-year  time  frame,  given  the  broad  range  of  outlooks  and 
orientations  of  the  analysts,  has  been  to  embrace  what  psychologists  call  "construct  validity."  This 
approach  involves  specifying  the  explicit  process  assumptions  for  each  argument  as  far  as  possible  and 
allowing  independent  judgments  to  be  made  separately  on  all  the  arguments  presented.  Some  of  the 
arguments  will  necessarily  be  stronger  than  others,  as  dictated  by  available  data  and  each  writer’s 
integrative  vision.  This  approach  also  provides  the  sponsor  with  a  clear  understanding  of  each  analyst’s 
point  of  view  and  allows  more  accurate  assessments  to  be  made  by  the  reader  than  would  be  possible  if 
some  mechanical  "homogenization"  technique  were  applied. 

From  the  beginning  of  this  project  the  researchers  have  believed  these  subject  areas  to  be  a  loop 
of  dependencies.  The  subjects  interact  with  and  depend  on  each  other  in  ways  that  are,  at  once,  clear 
yet  obscure.  What  the  United  States  is  as  a  society  depends  greatly  on  what  it  comprises:  the  myriad 
of  demographic  facts  that,  when  combined,  tell  us  who  we  will  be.  This  picture,  in  turn,  will  determine 
many  trends  in  economic  development.  For  example,  an  aging  population  provides  a  smaller  manpower 
pool,  hence  the  economy  will  either  focus  on  fewer  labor-intensive  industries  or  increase  the  use  of 
robots.  An  aging  population  also  means  that  productivity  will  have  to  increase  in  order  to  satisfy  the 
aging  population’s  wants  and  needs.  The  demands  of  the  economy  in  turn,  will  drive  the  natural  resource 
base  and  requirements.  If,  for  example,  the  United  States  is  manufacturing  products  requiring  rare  earth 
minerals  and  raw  materials  unavailable  domestically,  there  must  be  reliable  foreign  sources  of  supply. 
This  fact  means  that  the  economy  must  be  able  to  compete  effectively  in  global  markets,  and,  at  the  same 
time,  the  United  States  must  be  able  to  ensure  that  a  regional  power  or  powers  will  not  choke  off  that 
supply. 

Competing  in  a  global  economy  will  require  a  work  force  that  is  highly  educated  and  trained  in 
science  and  mathematics,  has  well-developed  cognitive  skills,  takes  individual  initiative  and  is  goal- 
oriented  yet  can  work  in  groups  to  solve  everyday  workplace  problems.  The  education  system  capable 
of  producing  graduates  having  these  skills  will  demand  a  commitment  from  society.  The  values  of  that 
society,  as  exhibited  through  its  social  structure  and  relationships,  will  determine  whether  the  education 
system  will  receive  the  attention  it  needs.  If  the  product  of  education  is  equipped  to  compete  globally, 
then  society’s  economic  surplus  will  increase  and  the  wealth  that  accrues  will  enable  the  society’s  needs 
to  be  met.  If  society’s  children  are  well  educated  and  competitive,  then  they  will  be  able  to  create  the 
technologies  of  tomorrow,  use  resources  more  efficiently  and  to  the  maximum  benefit,  and  society’s 
living  standard  will  continue  to  improve.  The  military  services  are,  in  a  sense,  the  ultimate 
consumer.  The  U.S.  Army  receives  the  product  of  education,  the  product  of  technological  research  and 
development,  and  the  product  of  the  economic  riches  of  society.  If  these  products  are  of  high  quality  and 
in  sufficient  quantity,  then  the  military  services  can  provide  for  the  society’s  security  and  meet  any 
geopolitical  crisis  that  may  emerge. 

By  way  of  overview  it  shall  be  explained  briefly  how  analysis  has  proceeded.  Figures  from  the 
United  States  Bureau  of  the  Census  have  been  used.  High  and  low  projections  for  population  growth  in 


3 


2015  have  been  forecasted  from  these  data,  scenarios  for  future  growth  in  racial  groups,  the  distribution 
of  age  cohorts,  potential  regional  population  shifts,  and  possible  immigration  patterns  have  been  mapped. 
The  impact  of  infant  mortality  and  disease  on  population  trends  have  also  been  projected. 

Analysis  will  show  the  effects  of  increasing  globalization  on  the  American  economy  and  how  this 
will  affect  the  relationship  of  the  manufacturing  and  service  sectors.  Global  resource  reserves  and 
projected  U.S.  needs  based  on  likely  future  technological  developments  will  be  studied.  From  these 
figures  the  steps  needed  to  be  taken  to  ensure  adequate  supplies  of  critical  resources  will  be  identified. 

The  education  system  will  be  investigated  to  determine  current  deficiencies  and  the  trends 
emerging  as  potential  solutions  to  problems  widely  acknowledged  by  educators  and  the  public  alike  will 
be  identified.  Analysts  will  project  possible  scenarios  for  the  likely  success  of  education  reforms. 

American  society  will  have  a  higher  percentage  of  elderly  people  in  2015  than  now.  As  a  result, 
the  available  manpower  pool  for  the  military  will  be  reduced  and  generational  conflicts  over  pensions  and 
benefits  for  retirees  might  possibly  occur.  The  role  women  will  play  in  the  labor  force  and  the  military 
will  be  projected.  Americans  will  continue  to  be  idealistic  and  express  strong  religious  beliefs  and 
affiliations.  While  the  United  States  will  not  be  isolationist,  it  will  not  be  the  "world’s  policeman":  U.S. 
forces  will  intervene  if  vital  interests  are  at  risk,  but  will  do  so  as  part  of  a  coalition  of  forces. 

The  concept  of  technological  development  and  the  limits  to  technological  change  will  be 
discussed.  Americans  will  be  in  the  forefront  of  technological  creativity  and  innovation,  but  it  is  not 
certain  that  United  States  industry  will  lead  in  the  manufacture  of  technological  products. 

The  development  of  military  science  in  light  of  changes  in  strategic  thinking  and  the  evolving 
system  of  international  relationships  will  be  forecast.  Current  U.S.  security  requirements  and  potential 
threats  based  on  likely  developments  in  the  world  system  will  be  projected.  The  end  of  the  Cold  War 
does  not  mean  "the  end  of  history"  but  rather  a  different  form  of  competition  between  rivals:  economic 
domination.  It  remains  to  be  seen  whether  economic  power  alone  can  define  superpower  status. 

The  United  States  will  be  challenged  in  many  ways  in  the  coming  25  years  and  the  challenges  will 
be  met.  Citizens  of  the  United  States  have  the  creative  talents  and  problem-solving  skills  to  meet  the  tests 
that  most  certainly  will  emerge.  It  is  to  these  forthcoming  issues  that  this  study  now  turns.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 
DEMOGRAPHY 


-  Based  on  the  1990  Census  figures,  the  population  of  the  United  States  in  2015  will  reach  303.4 

million. 

-  The  nation  will  become  more  ethnically  diverse,  with  37.8  percent  of  the  total  population 
identifying  itself  as  a  member  of  a  minority  group.  By  2015  Hispanic-Americans  will  be  the  largest 
minority  (44.4  million),  followed  by  Black-Americans  (41.9  million)  and  Asian-Americans  (13.3  million). 

-  Legal  immigration  will  average  550,000  to  600,000  per  year.  The  southern  border  of  the 
United  States  will  continue  to  be  semi-permeable:  economic  conditions  in  Central  and  Latin  America  are 
not  expected  to  improve  markedly  to  stem  the  tide  of  migrants  northward. 

—  Most  of  the  national  population  growth  will  be  attributed  to  ethnic  minorities.  In  the  18-25 
age  cohort,  the  percentage  of  ethnic  minorities  will  increase  from  32.9  to  44.5.  Recruitment  tactics  must 
improve  to  attract  and  retain  minorities  and  specialized  instruction  will  need  to  be  intensified. 

-  By  2015  the  median  age  of  the  population  will  be  37.6,  up  from  the  current  33.  The  ratio  of 
those  under  age  18  will  decline,  while  the  ratio  of  those  over  age  65  will  rise.  Life  expectancy  at  birth 
will  be  81.5  years  for  women  and  74.6  years  for  men. 

-  The  18-25  army  recruitment  cohort,  currently  12  percent  of  the  total  population,  will  drop  to 
10.7  percent  in  2015. 

-  The  average  army  soldier  will  be  over  the  age  of  30,  married  with  children  or  a  single  parent. 
This  soldier  will  be  the  oldest  in  combat  since  the  Civil  War.  The  Army  will  be  required  to  provide 
more  social  services  because  of  the  increasing  number  of  women  and  single  parents  in  active  and  reserve 
status. 

-  The  trend  toward  urbanization  will  continue.  More  than  half  of  the  nation’s  total  population 
resides  in  39  large  metropolitan  areas.  Two-thirds  of  the  Hispanic  population  will  be  centered  in  25  large 
metropolitan  areas. 

-  The  number  of  married-with-children  households  will  continue  to  fall,  and  the  number  of 
single-parent  households  will  rise,  with  the  overwhelming  majority  of  them  headed  by  women. 

-  The  effects  of  AIDS  will  persist  through  2015,  with  between  1,500  and  2,000  HIV-positive 
babies  to  be  born  every  year  in  the  next  25  years.  While  a  preventive  vaccine  is  likely  to  be  discovered 
in  the  forecast  period,  a  cure  for  those  already  stricken  is  uncertain.

DEMOGRAPHY  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  IN  2015 


INTRODUCTION 

The  population  of  the  United  States  totalled  249,632,692  on  April  1,  according  to  the  1990 
Census,  and  is  expected  to  reach  303.4  million  by  July  1,  2015  (see  Fig.  1).  These  figures  are  from  the 
Bureau  of  the  Census  and  are  not  completely  reliable.  On  April  18,  1991  the  Bureau  announced  an 
undercount  of  six  million  people  in  the  1990  census.  This  number  is  still  being  debated  and  undoubtedly 
will  be  subject  to  change  in  the  future.  Because  these  figures  arrived  as  this  study  was  in  its  final  stages, 
the  figures  used  herein  are  based  on  previously  announced  totals.  It  is  imperative,  therefore,  that  the 
reader  understand  that  revised  figures  by  the  Census  Bureau  will  skew  various  projected  numbers 
accordingly.  However,  the  trends  identified  through  the  analysis  presented  here  are  valid. 

The  population  is  multinational;  this  characteristic  of  the  population  will  be  more  pronounced  in 
2015,  when  ethnic  minorities  will  account  for  37.8  percent  of  the  total.  Hispanics  will  be  the  dominant 
minority  group.  The  country  will  be  largely  urban  and  more  densely  populated  in  the  South  and  West 
than  in  the  North  and  Midwest.  The  population  in  general  is  aging,  pushing  the  median  age  in  2015  to 
37.6  from  the  present  33. 

Progress  of  medical  science  in  the  treatment  of  disease  has  contributed  to  the  continuing  increase 
in  life  expectancy  from  the  present  72.1  for  men  and  78.9  for  women  to  a  projected  74.6  for  men  and 

81.5  for  women  in  2015.  Women  will  outnumber  men  by  a  ratio  of  104  to  100. 

The  number  of  married-with-children  households  in  the  United  States  fell  from  80.5  percent  of 
the  total  in  1980  to  77.1  percent  in  1988,  while  the  number  of  single-parent  households  rose  from  19.6 
percent  to  22.9  percent.  Of  the  7.3  million  single  parents  in  1988,  6.3  million  were  women,  15.2  percent 
more  than  in  1980. 

Single-parent  households  will  continue  to  rise  through  the  year  2015,  but  at  a  slower  rate. 
Because  the  fear  of  AIDS  has  caused  many  people  to  reduce  the  number  of  their  sexual  partners,  there 
has  been  a  noticeable  change  in  the  divorce  and  marriage  rates.  After  a  steady  rise  in  the  1970s,  divorce 
rates  have  begun  to  decline.  Marriage  rates  have  declined  since  1950,  but  the  number  of  marriages  has 
been  constant.  It  is  expected  that  the  divorce  rate  will  decline  further  and  the  number  of  marriages  will 
increase. 

The  U.S.  population  projections  in  this  study  are  based  on  Series  15,  one  of  30  series  tabulated 
by  the  Bureau  of  the  Census  in  its  population  projections  for  the  period  1988-2080.  Series  15,  using  a 
high  fertility  rate,  reflects  the  birth  surge  of  1989  (see  below).  Illustrating  the  difficulty  of  accurately 
projecting  population,  Series  14,  disseminated  as  the  official  projected  population,  was  based  on  a 
medium  fertility  rate.  By  1991,  the  number  of  children  under  five  years  of  age  in  this  series  was  at  least 

1.5  million  fewer  than  the  actual  number  in  the  cohort.  Hispanic  projections  are  based  on  Series  17,  one 
of  30  projections  for  the  Hispanic  population  from  1983  to  2080.  This  series  took  into  account  a  high 
rate  of  immigration.

Population  Trends  and  Projections 


The  U.S.  population  grew  at  an  annual  average  rate  of  less  than  1.0  percent  during  the  last  two 
census  years,  1980  and  1990.  This  rate  would  have  been  even  lower  had  it  not  been  for  the  birth  surge 
of  1989  and  the  legalization  of  a  large  group  of  originally  illegal  aliens.  The  average  annual  population 
growth  rate  was  1.9  percent  during  the  decade  1950-60;  then  it  sharply  dropped  in  the  following  two 
decades  to  1.3  percent  (1960-70)  and  1.1  percent  (1970-80). 

Through  the  analysis  of  projected  Bureau  of  the  Census  figures,  the  U.S.  population  will  reach 
303.4  million  by  July  1,  2015,  based  on  the  following  projections:  (a)  the  birth  surge  of  1989  will  slowly 
decline  from  about  16  per  thousand  to  14.4  in  2015;  (b)  the  death  rate  will  remain  near  the  current  level 
of  8.7  per  thousand  until  the  year  2000,  then  rise  to  9.0  per  thousand  by  the  year  2015;  (c)  net 
immigration  will  begin  at  600,000  per  year  in  1991  then  diminish  to  500,000  after  1998;  and  (d)  the 
assumption  that  no  unforeseen  events  will  occur  that  often  skew  demographic  projections,  such  as  natural 
calamities,  fatal  epidemics,  or  a  large  influx  of  illegal  immigrants  and  refugees.  A  change  in  one  or  more 
of  these  factors  could  shift  the  projected  population  from  a  high  of  320.5  million  to  a  low  of  265.1 
million  in  2015  (see  Table  1).

VITAL  STATISTICS 


Births 


At  the  height  of  the  Baby  Boom  in  the  early  1960s,  annual  births  peaked  at  nearly  4.3  million, 
fell  to  3.1  million  in  the  1970s,  then  slowly  rose  again  and  surged  in  1989  with  over  4  million  births. 
The  increase  in  the  number  of  births  recorded  in  the  late  1980’s  was  partially  attributed  to  the  rise  in 
teenage  pregnancies,  which  had  been  in  decline  for  the  25  years  before  1986.  About  half-a-million 
teenage  girls  became  single  mothers  in  1988;  this  number  would  have  even  higher  had  there  not  been 
416,000  abortions  and  more  than  120,000  miscarriages  or  stillbirths.  Also  contributing  to  the  high 
number  of  births  were  the  recent  immigrants,  especially  Asians  and  Hispanics,  who  have  a  much  higher 
fertility  rate  than  white  Americans.  The  high  1989  birth  rate  is  not  expected  to  be  a  continuing  long-term 
rise,  (see  Fig.  2) 

Deaths 


In  1988,  a  total  of  2,167,999  deaths  were  recorded  in  the  United  States,  44,676  more  than  in 
1987.  This  increase  was  attributed  to  the  continued  growth  in  the  size  of  the  population,  an  upward 
proportion  of  older  people,  and  an  influenza  outbreak  in  1988.  Infant  mortality  was  still  high  in  1990, 
with  9.1  per  1,000  births,  down  from  9.7  deaths  in  1989.  Each  year  nearly  40,000  infants  die  before 
reaching  their  first  birthday;  10,000  of  them  could  probably  be  saved  through  the  early  application  of 
commonly  known  preventive  measures.  Nineteen  large  cities  were  identified  as  having  an  infant  mortality 
rate  higher  than  the  national  average  for  the  five-year  period  from  1984  through  1988.  The  rates  ranged 
from  21.1  per  thousand  in  Washington,  D.C.  to  10.54  per  thousand  in  Los  Angeles.  Many  smaller  cities 
with  a  population  of  100,000  to  250,000  and  many  rural  counties  in  Mississippi  have  an  equally  high  rate 
of  infant  mortality. 

The  death  rate  is  not  expected  to  decrease  sharply  in  the  next  25  years  unless  extraordinary 
progress  in  medical  science  cuts  the  number  of  deaths  caused  by  the  current  leading  diseases  of  the  United 
States.  Among  these  are  coronary  heart  disease,  cerebrovascular  disease,  Alzheimers,  and  AIDS.  Deaths 
attributed  to  these  diseases  accounted  for  87  percent  of  those  recorded  in  1988.  Even  with  forecasted 
improvements  in  medical  care  (including  a  vaccine  and/or  an  affordable  cure)  and  changed  individual 
behavior,  the  death  toll  of  AIDS  is  expected  to  be  cut  by  a  mere  10  percent  over  10  years;  it  rose  over 
23  percent  between  1987  and  1988.  According  to  preliminary  data,  AIDS  was  the  11th  leading  cause 
of  death  in  1989.  In  1988,  AIDS  ranked  15th.  It  is  expected  that  AIDS  will  be  among  the  top  10  leading 
causes  of  death  in  coming  decades.  According  to  the  Center  for  Disease  Control  the  current  number  of 
Americans  suffering  from  virulent  AIDS  is  about  172,000,  and  specialists  there  estimate  approximately 
another  million  have  been  identified  as  HIV-positive.  The  Pan  American  Health  Organization  (PAHO) 
estimated  that  more  than  3  million  people  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  will  be  infected  with  the  AIDS 


9 


virus  by  the  mid-1990s.  In  Haiti,  one  in  ten  pregnant  women  is  infected  with  this  virus.  A  new  study 
published  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Medical  Association  indicates  that  in  the  United  States  about 
80,000  women  of  child-bearing  age  may  be  HIV-positive.  This  figure  means  that  between  1,500  to  2,000 
babies  could  be  born  HIV-positive  each  year.  The  areas  with  the  highest  rates  of  infected  women  in  the 
study  were  New  York  with  5.8  per  thousand,  the  District  of  Columbia  with  5.5,  New  Jersey  with  4.9, 
and  Florida  with  4.5. 

Some  progress  has  been  made  in  coping  with  this  disease.  Medical  research  has  made  rapid 
progress  in  identifying  the  virus  and  its  replication  apparatus.  It  is  probable  that  a  cure  and/or  a  vaccine 
will  be  found  in  the  forecast  period.  Other  venereal  diseases  have  shown  a  higher  rate  of  incidence. 
Since  1986,  syphilis  cases  nationally  have  almost  doubled,  with  the  largest  increases  occurring  in  low- 
income  areas  of  major  cities.  National  health  experts  have  blamed  much  of  the  severe  syphilis  outbreak 
in  urban  centers  on  growing  use  of  crack  cocaine  and  prostitution.  A  dramatic  drop  in  infection  rates 
has  recently  been  noted  in  a  few  states  where  an  aggressive  AIDS-prevention  program  has  been  enacted 
(for  example,  Colorado),  leading  some  public  health  officials  to  conclude  that  the  AIDS  and  syphilis 
efforts  complement  each  other. 

Teenage  sexual  activity  rose  sharply  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  It  declined  slightly  in  the  early 
1980s,  but  increased  again  in  the  mid-  and  late  1980s  despite  the  dissemination  of  much  information  about 
the  ever  present  danger  of  HIV  infection.  According  to  the  National  Survey  of  Family  Growth,  53  percent 
of  all  15-to  19-year-old  females  were  sexually  active  in  1988,  up  from  47  percent  in  1982.  More  than 
20  percent  of  all  AIDS  victims  are  in  their  twenties.  Given  the  incubation  period  between  initial  HIV 
infection  and  the  virulent  onset  of  recognizable  AIDS  symptoms,  most  probably  became  infected  as 
teenagers.  In  San  Francisco  alone,  10,000  AIDS  victims  were  recorded  on  14  February,  1991  and 
10,058  at  the  end  of  the  month,  an  increase  of  58  in  a  scant  14  days.  It  is  estimated  that  about  20,000 
to  25,000  San  Franciscans  are  HIV-positive.  Studies  indicate  that  up  to  20  percent  of  the  city’s 
homosexual  men  between  the  ages  of  16  to  24  are  probably  infected,  an  obvious  danger  sign  of  yet 
another  wave  of  AIDS.  In  the  Washington,  D.C.  area,  the  AIDS  infection  rate  is  also  very  high, 
averaging  approximately  3.5  new  AIDS  cases  per  day.  More  than  3,000  have  died  since  1982,  and 
39,100  are  believed  to  be  HIV-positive.  Other  cities  reporting  higher  numbers  of  AIDS  cases  are  New 
York  City  (31,635),  Los  Angeles  (11,409),  Houston  (5,086),  Miami  (4,633),  Newark,  New  Jersey 
(4,571),  Chicago  (4,236),  Philadelphia  (3,597),  and  Atlanta  (3526),  all  major  metropolitan  areas.  The 
disease  has  a  high  incidence  among  intravenous  drug  users  and  their  sexual  partners,  and  children.

Immigration  and  Outmigration 


Net  immigration  accounted  for  40  percent  of  the  population  growth  in  the  late  1800s  but  ebbed 
during  the  years  of  the  great  depression.  In  the  past  decade,  the  rate  of  net  immigration  accounted  for 
30  percent  of  the  population  growth  because  the  United  States  represents  widely  publicized  opportunities 
for  freedom,  jobs,  and  education  to  peoples  around  the  world.  This  rate  will  likely  increase  as  long  as 
poverty  and  political  instability  in  the  countries  of  Central  and  South  America  and  the  Third  World 
persevere.  Most  immigrants  of  the  past  two  decades  have  been  Asian  and  Hispanic  rather  than  European, 
unlike  earlier  periods.  More  than  2.5  million  illegal  aliens  were  granted  amnesty  under  the  1986 
Immigration  Reform  and  Control  Act.  A  major  change  in  the  new  U.S.  Immigration  Act  of  1990,  which 
becomes  effective  in  October  1991,  will  tilt  the  balance  more  toward  European  applicants  and  away  from 
Asians.  The  new  bill  emphasizes  the  admission  of  foreigners  having  professions  and  skills  deemed 
necessary  by  the  United  States.  It  replaces  the  1965  Hart-Cellar  Act,  which  granted  quotas  on  the  basis 
of  kinship  with  U.S.  citizens  or  ties  to  its  residents,  rather  than  on  country-of-origin.  The  1990  bill 
emphasizing  skills  raises  legal  immigration  from  the  current  level  of  about  500,000  per  year  to  700,000 
per  year  for  the  first  three  years,  then  to  675,000  thereafter.  The  number  of  visas  granted  on  the  basis 
of  desired  job  skills  will  be  almost  three  times  the  current  54,000,  up  to  140,000;  family-sponsored  visas 
will  increase  by  a  smaller  margin,  from  the  current  435,000  a  year  to  465,000  for  the  first  three  years 
and  to  480,000  thereafter. 

The  number  of  emigrants  from  the  United  States  has  been  around  100,000  a  year.  Most  of  these 
people  returned  to  their  original  countries  or  sought  other  places  with  an  equally  desirable  political 
climate  or  environment.  It  is  projected  that  the  emigrants  will  number  between  100,000  to  160,000  a 
year. 

Age  Distribution 

Over  the  next  two  decades,  the  massive  Baby  Boom  cohorts  will  all  be  over  age  45,  and  the  large 
number  of  babies  born  in  the  late  80s  and  early  90s  will  be  below  30.  This  situation  will  effect  a  shift 
in  the  median  age  from  33.0  in  1990  to  37.6  in  2015.  The  dependency  ratio,  which  indicates  how  many 
children  and  elderly  people  there  will  be  for  every  100  persons  of  working-age  (18-65),  reflects  the 
change  in  the  age  structure  (see  Table  2).  Large  numbers  of  aging  or  youthful  populations  affect 
dependency  relations  within  that  population.  The  ratio  of  those  under  18  is  expected  to  continue  to 
decline  through  the  year  2015  and  the  ratio  of  those  over  65  is  expected  to  rise.  It  is  projected  that  the 
ratio  of  dependents  to  the  working-age  population  will  be  lower  during  the  next  25  years  than  in  earlier 
decades,  going  from  76.7  per  hundred  in  1960  to  61.8  in  2015.  The  dependency  of  the  youthful 
population  (17  years  old  and  under)  is  expected  to  continue  to  decline  from  62.8  per  hundred  in  1960  to 
39.6  per  hundred  in  2015.  Conversely,  the  elderly  (over  66  years  old)  dependency  ratio  will  continue 
to  rise,  from  13.9  per  hundred  in  1960  to  22.3  per  hundred  in  2015.

The  18-to-25-year-old  group-an  important  segment  to  colleges,  the  military,  and  employers-- 
estimated  to  number  32.4  million  in  2015,  would  be  smaller  if  it  were  not  for  the  unexpectedly  high 
number  of  births  of  1989.  On  the  high  projection,  this  group  will  reach  over  34.0;  on  the  low  projection, 
less  than  27.0  (see  Table  3).  The  personal  behavior  of  this  group  should  be  of  interest  to  future  military 
recruiters.  Recent  surveys  show  that  college  students’  use  of  illicit  drugs  is  at  its  lowest  level  in  a 
decade,  although  marijuana,  hallucinogens,  and  cocaine  are  still  to  be  found  on  campuses.  The 
University  of  Michigan’s  Institute  for  Social  Research  in  a  recent  1990  survey  indicates  that  only

15  percent  of  the  students  admitted  having  used  an  illegal  drug  in  the  past  month,  down  from  38  percent 
of  1980.  Seventy-five  percent  reported  monthly  alcohol  consumption,  also  down  from  80  percent  of 
1980.  Accurate  projections  of  future  drug  and  alcohol  use  are  mere  guesses.  If,  as  some  social  scientists 
believe,  the  United  States  is  in  the  early  stages  of  another  temperance  movement  (two  previous  such 
temperance  eras  have  been  recorded,  each  lasting  roughly  30  years),  then  alcohol  and  drug  use  could 


13 


decline  even  further  in  the  forecast  period.  If  illicit  drug  use  does  change  significantly,  then  the 
American  public  may  come  to  grips  with  this  issue  in  another  manner  (see  "Society"). 

Both  age  groups,  those  under  18  years  old  and  those  aged  18  to  65,  are  expected  to  decrease  only 
slightly  in  25  years,  from  25.7  percent  of  the  total  population  in  1990  to  24.5  percent  in  2015  for  the 
group  under  18;  and  62.6  percent  of  1990  to  61.8  percent  for  the  group  aged  18  to  65.  The  number  of 
the  older,  66  years  old  or  more,  will  increase  from  11.7  percent  in  1990  to  13.7  percent  in  2015  because 
of  the  impact  of  the  Baby  Boom  years  (see  Table  4).  In  1990  there  were  almost  157  million  people  of 
working-age  in  the  United  States;  they  paid  Social  Security  taxes  for  29.4  million  elderly,  a  ratio  of  5.4 
workers  to  1  retiree.  This  ratio  will  decline  in  25  years  to  4.5  workers  per  retiree.  In  addition  to 
increased  pensions  for  retirees,  Social  Security  will  have  to  absorb  rising  medical  costs.  Retirement  age 
will  likely  be  extended  to  70  in  order  to  maintain  system  solvency.  As  life  expectancy  pushes  close  to 
80  for  men  and  over  80  for  women,  this  is  not  an  unrealistic  projection.

Ethnic  Composition 

The  Bureau  of  the  Census  does  not  give  a  separate  breakdown  for  Hispanics;  for  statistical 
purposes  Hispanics  are  forced  to  choose  between  white,  black,  or  other  on  census  forms.  Therefore  the 
current  number  for  whites  combines  people  of  European  background  with  Hispanics;  the  number  for 
blacks  includes  people  of  African  background  and  Hispanics;  and  the  number  for  Others  includes  people 
of  mixed-races  and  Hispanics,  plus  those  who  have  not  identified  themselves  as  white,  black,  Hispanic, 
Asian,  American  Indian  or  Aleuts.  For  this  study,  an  effort  was  made  to  separate  Hispanics  from  the 


16 


whites,  blacks,  and  others  figures.  All  numbers  pertaining  to  ethnics  reflect  this  reconstruction.

Table  6  shows  the  expected  future  changes  in  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  U.S  population 
resulting  from  the  last  two  decades  of  heavy  immigration:  legal,  illegal,  refugee.  These  changes  will 
require  many  program  alterations  in  American  institutions,  such  as  education,  labor,  health  and  welfare, 
and  the  military.  The  majority  of  immigrants,  seeking  a  haven  and  the  golden  opportunity  of  the  United 
States  (especially  Hispanic  and  Asian  illegal  immigrants)  are  poor  and  often  illiterate  in  their  own 
language.  On  the  positive  side,  immigrants  frequently  help  accelerate  the  pace  of  American  growth  and 
development;  on  the  negative  side,  they  just  as  often  arouse  ethnic  conflict  and  racial  tensions. 
Periodically,  certain  groups  of  Americans  set  out  to  curtail  the  influx  of  immigrants,  but  the 
acknowledged  need  for  more  people,  coupled  with  the  well  known  commitment  of  America  to  be  the  land 
of  the  free  and  a  haven  for  the  distressed,  prevents  serious  legislative  curbs.  The  latest  Immigration  Act 
(1990)  reflects  this  commitment.  The  government  presently  contemplates  admitting  entry  to  all, 
regardless  of  their  health  status,  even  those  with  serious  contagious  diseases,  including  AIDS.  This  policy 
is  contrary  to  the  old  laws  which  prohibited  entry  of  those  considered  to  have  less  serious  diseases,  such 
as  leprosy  and  tuberculosis. 

Most  of  the  future  population  growth  in  the  United  States  will  come  from  Asians,  Hispanics  and 
others.  The  two  ethnic  groups  that  have  the  largest  number  of  kin-related  people  now  in  this  country  are 
Asians  and  Hispanics.  Their  fertility  rates  are  generally  higher  than  those  of  whites  and  their  death  rates 
are  lower  than  those  of  blacks  and  whites. 


17 


In  2015,  whites,  excluding  white-Hispanics,  will  represent  62.8  percent  of  the  total  population, 
down  from  71.8  percent  in  1990,  while  minorities  will  grow  to  37.2  percent,  up  from  28.2  percent  in 
1990  (see  Fig.  4). 

Whites  (exclusive  of  Hispanics)  will  add  7.2  million  through  the  year  2005  and  another  3.3 
million  by  2015.  Most  of  the  next  decade’s  addition  will  be  via  immigrants  rather  than  from  any  natural 
growth. 

Blacks,  excluding  census-identified  black  Hispanics,  are  projected  to  increase  to  36.6  million  in 
2005  and  41.9  million  by  2015,  representing  12.9  and  13.8  percent,  respectively.  Their  increase  would 
be  more  substantial  if  it  were  not  for  their  high  death  rate.  A  recent  study  by  the  District  of  Columbia 
Public  Health  Department  indicated  that  the  national  black  mortality  rate  was  4.5  times  the  white  rate. 
Even  of  the  preventable  diseases,  such  as  tuberculosis,  hypertensive  heart  disease,  and  pneumonia,  blacks 
were  more  likely  to  die  earlier  than  whites.  The  mortality  rate  for  black  infants  was  registered  at  17.6 
per  thousand  in  1990,  more  than  twice  the  rate  of  8.5  for  white  infants.  Homicide  was  the  leading  cause 
of  death  among  black  15-to  44-year  olds.  In  the  25-to  44-age  group,  blacks  were  2.5  times  more  likely 
to  die  than  whites.  Rising  AIDS  and  homicide  rates  have  cut  the  average  life  expectancy  of  black  males 
to  64.9  years  in  1988  from  65.2  in  1987,  compared  to  72.3  years  for  white  males. 

Hispanics  will  double  their  numbers  in  25  years  and  become  a  larger  minority  than  Blacks  (see 
Fig.  5).  They  totalled  22.4  million  according  to  the  1990  Census  and  will  be  44.5  million  in  2015. 
Their  rapid  increase  is  attributed  both  to  high  rates  of  immigration  and  fertility.  They  represent  the 
largest  group  of  illegal  immigrants  of  the  last  two  decades,  fleeing  poverty  and  political  instability  in  their 
countries.  With  the  relatively  easy  access  across  an  almost  uncontrollable  frontier,  their  flow  into  the 
United  States  has  been  largely  unimpeded.  The  amnesty  several  years  ago  legalized  approximately  two 
million;  there  are  thousands  more  unaccounted  for.  Without  legal  resident  status,  they  are  ineligible  for 
many  federal  welfare  programs.  Many  of  them  are  teens  who  work  for  substandard  wages  and  are  forced 
to  live  with  friends  and  relatives  in  crowded  quarters.  Because  they  work  in  order  to  be  able  to  send 
money  back  to  their  countries  to  help  their  families,  these  teens  have  not  been  able  to  readily  further  their 
education. 

Asians  make  up  the  next  largest  minority  group.  They  have  increased  tremendously  in  the  last 
decade:  over  95  percent.  Asians  had  a  higher  fertility  rate  and  lower  death  rate  than  whites.  The  death 
rate  among  Asian  adults  in  1988  was  about  half  that  of  white  adults.  Immigration  accounted  for  most 
of  the  growth  registered  in  the  last  decade  because  the  United  States  admitted  more  than  a  million 
refugees  from  Southeast  Asia.  The  number  of  Asians  will  continue  to  increase,  but  at  a  much  lower  rate 
because  immigration  has  dropped.  If  the  economies  of  many  Asian  countries  prosper  as  expected,  fewer 
Asians  will  attempt  to  migrate  to  the  United  States.  Nevertheless,  a  number  from  less  economically 
fortunate  areas  are  expected  to  come  before  the  year  2000,  especially  those  having  relatives  in  the  United 
States.  Approximately  500,000  Hong  Kong  residents,  and  some  from  Taiwan,  are  expected  to  emigrate 
to  the  United  States,  especially  when  Hong  Kong  reverts  to  China  in  1997.  By  2015,  Asians  will  number 
about  13  million,  representing  4.4  percent  of  the  total  population,  up  from  the  2.9  percent  in  1990.

American  Indians,  including  Aleuts,  increased  about  38  percent  during  the  last  two  censuses  to 
almost  2  million.  This  growth  is  attributed  to  the  increased  tendency  of  people  with  some  Indian  ancestry 
to  designate  themselves  as  Indian  for  the  1990  Census,  but  as  white  or  some  other  ethnic  group  in  earlier 
tallies.  Their  natural  growth  rate  has  been  low  and  is  expected  to  remain  at  the  same  level  for  the  next 
25  years.  With  no  further  identity  changes,  they  will  number  about  2.5  million  in  2015. 

The  number  in  "Others"  grew  over  45  percent  between  1980  and  1990,  from  6.8  to  9.5  million, 
in  part  because  of  the  inability  to  identify  the  individual’s  true  category.  These  persons  include  those 
who,  for  personal  reasons,  did  not  find  it  possible  to  indicate  the  appropriate  Bureau  of  the  Census 
race/ethnic  designation  (White,  Black,  Hispanic,  Asian,  American  Indian,  or  Aleut).  Millions  fell  into 
this  category. 

The  Bureau  of  the  Census  is  in  the  process  of  adjusting  these  data  for  "Others"  and  it  will  attempt 
to  elicit  more  accurate  information  on  the  origin  of  respondants.  These  individuals  will  be  assigned  an 
ethnic/race  designation  deemed  appropriate  based  on  other  information  gleaned  from  the  census  forms. 
Until  the  number  of  "Others"  is  revised  and  its  existing  base  of  data  is  reflected  more  precisely,  the 
population  of  "Others"  is  projected  to  be  about  10.6  million  in  2015. 

Individuals  of  mixed  race  are  included  in  the  "Others"  category.  Interracial  marriages  have 
increase  considerably,  from  310,000  in  1970  to  956,000  in  1988.  These  marriages  are  expected  to 
continue  to  rise  as  prejudice  against  interracial  marriage  diminishes.  The  children  of  these  unions  will 
have  the  choice  of  self-identification  when  they  reach  the  age  of  18.  Until  that  time,  they  will  be 
classified  under  the  race/ethnic  category  of  their  fathers  or  single  mothers.  The  number  of  ethnic  groups 
identified  will  be  affected  significantly  by  changes  made  by  these  young  mixed-race  adults  in  future 
censuses.  The  Bureau  of  the  Census  is  currently  developing  additional  ethnic  designations  for  the  census 
of  2000. 

High  and  low  projections  of  ethnic  groups  are  shown  in  Table  7.

The  number  of  Hispanic  males  18-to  25-years-old  will  reach  2.5  million  in  2005  up  from  1.7 
million  in  1990,  an  increase  of  41.4  percent,  the  fastest  growth  of  all  ethnic  groups.  For  the  same 
period,  blacks  and  Others,  which  include  Asians  and  American  Indians,  will  follow  with  a  growth  rate 
of  12.3  percent  and  20.8  percent,  respectively.  At  the  same  time,  the  number  of  white  males  will  decline 
by  one  million  (see  Table  8).

Regional  Population  Trends  and  Projections 


Regional 

The  last  two  censuses  identified  the  West  as  having  the  fastest  growth  rate  in  the  country  at  23.4 
percent,  followed  by  the  Southeast,  14.8  percent,  and  Southwest,  11.2  percent.  The  West,  next  to  the 
Southwest,  was  one  of  the  two  least  populated  regions  in  1990,  but  it  will  be  one  of  the  two  most 
populous  in  2015.  Its  inhabitants  represented  only  19.2  percent  of  the  total,  but  will  increase  to  21.9 
percent.  By  contrast,  the  Midwest,  most  populous  in  1990  with  22.9  percent  of  the  total  population,  will 
decline  to  19.1  percent  (see  Fig.  6). 

In  addition  to  the  large  immigration  of  Asians  and  Hispanics  who  seem  to  prefer  to  settle  in  these 
warmer  regions,  other  factors  contributing  to  their  growth  are  the  migration  of  people  from  economically 
troubled  industries  in  the  Northeastern  and  Midwestern  states.  In  addition,  two-thirds  of  all  retirees 
moved  to  these  warmer  areas,  boosting  local  economies,  since  retirees  often  contribute  more  than  they 
demand.  Older  migrants  use  fewer  public  services,  and  the  taxes  generated  by  the  contribution  of  their 
retirement  incomes  substantially  offset  any  public  costs.  Their  spending  has  a  great  impact  on  the 
economy  of  a  community.  Many  states  are  vying  for  out-of-state  retirees.  This  growing  competition  may 
change  the  size,  direction,  and  composition  of  the  migration  pattern  of  the  elderly  in  the  next  25  years.

POPULATION  SIZE 

BY  U.  S.  ARMY  RECRUITMENT  DIVISION 

1990-2015 


r- 


The  population  growth  in  the  Southern  and  Western  regions  is  expected  to  continue  through  the  year  2015 
but  at  a  lower  rate.  It  is  estimated  that  in  2015  the  West  will  have  an  additional  18.5  million  people 
reaching,  66.6  million;  the  Southeast  will  add  16.4  million  to  its  50.7  million;  and  the  Southwest  will 
increase  to  47.9  million,  or  10.5  million  more  (see  Table  9). 

States 


Between  the  two  census  years  1980-90,  the  state  that  topped  all  gains  was  Nevada,  with  a  50. 1 
percent  increase,  followed  by  Alaska  with  36.9  percent,  Arizona  with  34.8  percent,  and  Florida  with  32.7 
percent.  California,  as  expected,  remained  the  most  populous  state  in  the  nation,  followed  by  New  York, 
Texas,  and  Florida.  Large  influxes  of  Asian  and  Hispanic  immigrants  and  of  people  from  the  East  Coast 
and  the  recession-stricken  industrial  Midwest  accounted  for  most  of  the  population  growth  in  California, 
Texas,  and  Florida.  California’s  Hispanic  population  grew  nearly  70  percent  in  the  last  decade,  while 
Asians  increased  127  percent.  The  7.7  million  Hispanics,  representing  25.8  percent  of  California’s 
population  in  1990  or  34.4  percent  of  the  nation’s  Hispanics,  outnumbered  the  total  population  of  all  but 
eight  states.  Their  growth  is  attributed  to  immigrants  from  countries  below  the  southern  border  of  the 
United  States  and  to  the  high  reproductive  rate  of  the  population  already  in  the  state.  California  also  had 
the  largest  group  of  Asians  in  the  country,  with  a  total  of  over  2.8  million  as  of  1990,  representing  39. 1 
percent  of  all  Asians.  New  York  had  2.2  million  Hispanics  and  0.7  million  Asians,  or  12.3  percent  and 
3.9  percent  respectively  of  New  York’s  total  population.  Texas  was  second  to  California  in  Hispanic 
population,  with  over  4.3  million,  which  also  reflects  the  impact  of  immigration  from  countries  below 
the  southern  border.  Asians  in  Texas  numbered  0.3  million.  Florida  tallied  1.6  million  Hispanics  and 
0.2  million  Asians  among  its  population.  Five  areas  that  lost  some  population  in  the  1990  Census  were 
Montana,  North  Dakota,  Iowa,  West  Virginia,  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  The  District  of  Columbia 
is  contesting  the  1990  Census  count.  The  Bureau  of  the  Census  has  admitted  that  it  had  missed  up  to 
58,000  residents.  Because  of  shifts  occurring  in  the  United  States  in  manufacturing  and  industrial 
development  these  trends  are  likely  to  continue  (see  "Economy"). 

In  25  years,  California  will  still  have  the  country’s  largest  population.  New  York  will  fall  from 
second  (its  ranking  after  the  1990  Census)  to  fourth  behind  Texas  and  Florida  by  2025.  Eleven  states 
in  the  middle  portions  of  the  country  are  expected  to  lose  some  population.  By  contrast,  the  District  of 
Columbia  will  regain  some  (see  Table  10).

Cities 


The  1990  Census  shows  that  for  the  first  time,  more  than  half  of  the  country’s  population  lives 
in  standard  metropolitan  areas  (S.M.A.).  Most  of  the  national  population  growth  in  the  last  decade 
occurred  in  these  areas  (see  Table  11).  Smaller  cities  also  gained  population  and  new  small  cities 
mushroomed  throughout  the  country.  While  large  and  small  cities  proliferated,  rural  towns  became 
relatively  deserted.  Young  rural  people  left  their  towns  for  better  opportunities  in  the  cities.  Losses  in 
rural  population  were  highest  in  the  Midwest.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  in  the  forecast  period. 
Further  depopulation  of  the  central  sections  of  the  United  States  are  expected  with  the  continuing  decline 
in  agricultural  employment  (see  "Economy"). 

The  fastest  growing  metropolises  were  in  Florida  and  in  the  Southwest:  Orlando  recorded  a  53.3 
percent  increase  over  1980;  Naples  grew  by  77  percent;  Fort  Pierce,  66  percent;  and  Fort  Myers,  63 
percent.  The  growth  in  these  S.M.As  is  attributed  primarily  to  retirees.  Fast  growing  S.M.As  in  other 
states  include  Las  Vegas,  Nevada  with  a  60  percent  increase;  Austin,  Texas  with  46  percent;  and  Las 
Cruces,  New  Mexico  with  41  percent.  The  New  York  metropolitan  area  was  among  the  slower  growing 
areas,  with  only  a  3.1  percent  gain  over  the  decade;  nevertheless  it  remained  the  country’s  largest  with 
18.1  million,  up  over  half  a  million  from  1980.  Los  Angeles  followed  with  over  14.5  million,  or  an 
increase  of  26.4  percent  over  1980.  If  New  York  and  Los  Angeles  continue  to  grow  at  their  present 
rates,  the  population  of  metropolitan  Los  Angeles  will  outnumber  that  of  New  York  by  the  year  2005. 
Five  S.M.As  --  Cleveland,  Detroit,  Pittsburgh,  New  Orleans,  and  Buffalo  --  have  suffered  population 
losses  during  the  same  period.  As  metropolitan  areas  grow  in  population  and  annex  additional  territories, 
the  affected  central  cities  lose  some  of  their  population.  City  residents  with  sufficient  income  flee  to  the 
more  attractive  suburban  areas  where  crime  and  drug  use  are  low  and  housing  is  more  affordable.  The 
result  is  a  diminishing  population  and  tax  base  for  the  losing  central  cities.  In  the  last  15  years  several 
cities  have  also  lost  jobs  to  the  burgeoning  nearby  suburbs.  According  to  a  recent  report  by  the  National 
League  of  Cities,  incomes  of  people  in  the  largest  central  cities  are  lower  than  those  of  the  suburbanites 
by  41  percent.  Central  cities  had  43  percent  of  the  nation’s  poor  in  1989  as  compared  with  the  37 
percent  in  1979. 

The  overall  data  indicate  a  dramatic  shift  of  population  from  Northeast  and  Midwest  to 
the  South  and  West.  The  data  also  show  that  people  tend  to  move  to  areas  with  concentrations  of  at  least 


29 


one  million  people  where  jobs  are  more  readily  available.  The  Los  Angeles  S.M.A.  and  the  Boston 
S.M.A.  top  the  list  of  25  areas  expected  to  generate  new  jobs  through  the  year  2000.  Table  12  shows 
how  the  ranking  of  these  25  cities  changed  in  four  years  (1982-86).  As  the  structure  of  the  economy 
changes,  these  trends  will  continue  through  the  forecast  period.

HISPANIC  POPULATION 


Within  the  next  two  decades,  Hispanic-Americans  will  be  the  largest  minority  group  in  the  United 
States.  They  made  up  9.0  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  in  1990,  up  from  6.4  percent  in  1980,  a  growth 
attributable  to  both  rapid  immigration  and  high  fertility.  At  this  rate,  they  should  reach  over  44.4  million 
in  2015  or  14.6  percent  of  the  total  population.  In  the  event  of  worsening  conditions,  i.e.,  political 
turmoil  or  deteriorating  economic  conditions  in  the  countries  below  the  southern  border,  there  will  be 
larger  influxes  of  immigrants.  The  number  of  Hispanics  could  reach  48  million.  On  the  other  hand,  if 
conditions  improve  (i.e.,  there  is  political  stability  and  prosperity)  large  numbers  of  Hispanics  in  the 
United  States  would  possibly  return  to  their  former  countries.  Thus  the  number  of  remaining  Hispanics 
could  be  as  low  as  28.5  million  in  2015  (see  Table  13).

The  Hispanic  population  is  younger,  poorer,  less  educated  and  from  larger  families  than  other 
ethnic  groups.  Their  median  age  in  1990  was  25.6  and  will  be  27.5  in  2005  and  29.0  in  2015.  As  shown 
in  Table  14,  Hispanics  aged  18  to  45  will  represent  44.0  percent  of  the  total  Hispanic  population  in  2005 
and  42.4  percent  in  2015  (medium  projection.)  In  1989,  Hispanics  aged  18  to  25  dropped  out  of  high 
schools  at  a  rate  of  62.8  percent.  Of  this  age  group,  16. 1  percent  enrolled  in  college,  56  percent  of  them 
in  two-year  colleges.  Enrollment  in  graduate  school  fell  by  15.2  percent  between  1986  and  1988.  Table 
15  reflects  the  Hispanic  population  distribution  and  by  age  cohorts  and  by  sex  for  the  years  2005  and 
2015.

The  largest  concentration  of  Hispanics  will  be  found  in  the  West,  with  an  estimated  42. 1  percent 
of  total  Hispanic  population  in  2005  and  43.2  in  2015.  The  Southwest  will  have  over  25  percent  of  the 
Hispanics,  and  the  Northeast  about  16  percent  (see  Table  16).  Metropolitan  areas  containing  large 
Hispanic  populations  are  shown  in  Table  17.  Hispanic  population  distribution  by  selected  age  cohorts

Hispanics  in  the  United  States  vary  greatly  in  their  education,  economic  status,  and  ability  to  cope 
in  American  society  and  culture.  Because  so  many  are  first-generation  immigrants,  they  tend  to  cling 
to  their  native  culture.  It  is  believed  that  only  26  percent  of  them  are  fluent  in  English  and  that  47 
percent  struggle  to  cope  with  the  language.  More  than  2  million  adults  speak  only  Spanish.  Nearly  three 
in  four  continue  to  speak  Spanish  at  home;  few  families  in  California  and  New  Mexico  have  completely 
adopted  English.  Those  born  in  the  United  States  are  fluent  in  English  and  thereby  earn  as  much  as 


39 


people  of  European  descent.  This  trend  follows  historical  patterns  of  immigration.  It  is  expected  that 
a  greater  degree  of  assimilation  will  occur  with  succeeding  generations. 

Cuban-Americans,  estimated  to  number  1.0  million  in  1990,  or  4.6  percent  of  the  total  Hispanic 
population,  are  concentrated  in  Florida.  Some  of  them  have  settled  in  the  New  York  Metropolitan  Area. 
In  1987  the  Cubans  were  reported  to  have  a  median  family  income  of  nearly  $27,000,  the  highest  of  all 
Hispanics. 

Mexican- Americans,  estimated  to  number  13.496  million,  made  up  60.4  percent  of  the  1990 
Hispanic  population.  In  the  1980  census,  74  percent  were  native  born.  The  median  age  of  Mexican- 
Americans  is  24  years,  compared  to  33  for  all  U.S.  residents.  They  tend  to  marry  young  and  have 
children  at  early  ages.  Mexican-American  women  have  experienced  less  marital  instability  than  other 
Hispanic  women,  except  for  Cubans.  As  a  result,  the  proportion  of  Mexican-American  children  living 
in  two-parent  households  is  higher  than  other  Hispanic  groups.  But  like  all  ethnic  groups  in  the  U.S., 
the  number  of  Mexican-American  single-parent  households  is  rising. 

Mexican-Americans  are  concentrated  in  California  and  in  other  parts  the  Southwest,  the  majority 
in  urban  areas.  The  Los  Angeles  area  has  about  2  million  Hispanics  of  Mexican  origin;  more  than  70 
percent  of  them  are  under  age  35.  There  are  many  well  developed  Mexican  communities  in  the 
Southwest  that  newcomers  can  blend  in  with  easily,  causing  great  difficulties  for  the  too  few  federal 
authorities  whose  job  it  is  to  apprehend  illegal  or  undocumented  immigrants  from  south  of  the  border. 
Because  the  newcomers  do  not  have  to  relinquish  their  language  or  cultural  ties,  their  rate  of  assimilation 
and  acculturation  to  American  ways  is  slow. 

In  1988  the  median  Mexican-American  family  income  was  $21,025,  about  two-thirds  of  the 
national  median  family  income  of  $32,191.  More  than  19  percent  of  Mexican-American  families  were 
headed  by  women  and  half  of  these  live  in  poverty.  According  to  the  1989  Bureau  of  Census  data,  about 
25  percent  of  all  Mexican-American  families  lived  below  the  official  poverty  line.  Except  for  Puerto 
Ricans,  this  poverty  rate  exceeds  that  of  all  Hispanic  groups. 

Puerto  Ricans,  the  majority  living  in  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  totalled  over  2.7  million  in 
1990,  or  12.2  percent  of  the  total  Hispanic  population.  Their  family  income  was  $14,600  in  1987. 
Forty-three  percent  of  Puerto  Rican  families  were  headed  by  women  in  1987;  two-thirds  of  them  lived 
below  the  poverty  line.  It  is  estimated  that  one-third  of  the  people  who  identify  themselves  as  Puerto 
Ricans  live  not  in  Puerto  Rico  but  in  the  United  States. 

Other  Hispanics,  numbering  5.1  million  in  the  1990  Census,  are  from  the  Caribbean,  Central  and 
South  America.  It  is  believed  that  300,000  Hispanic  immigrants  have  come  from  the  Dominican  Republic 
and  over  500,000  from  El  Salvador. 

SIGNIFICANCE  OF  THE  DEMOGRAPHIC  DATA 

The  demographic  data  presented  above  indicate  that  by  the  year  2015,  the  United  States  will  have 
a  sizable  aging  population,  a  smaller  work  force,  more  retirees  for  far  fewer  workers,  a  working  group 


40 


whose  working  age  will  have  to  be  extended  to  70,  a  good  many  households  headed  by  single  parents, 
a  declining  number  of  white  Americans,  an  increasing  size  of  minority  populations  that  will  make  up  37.8 
percent  of  the  total  population,  and  a  need  for  more  social  services. 

Implications  for  the  Army 

In  2015,  the  population  of  the  United  States  will  be  aging  and  highly  urbanized,  and  will  comprise 
a  sizeable  ethnic  minority. 

Unless  the  draft  is  reinstated  forcing  thousands  of  18-25-year-olds  into  the  Army  (see  "Society"), 
the  average  Army  soldier  will  be  over  the  age  of  30,  married  with  children  or  a  single  parent.  This  will 
be  the  oldest  in  combat  since  the  Civil  War. 

There  will  be  a  rise  in  single-parent  households,  the  majority  of  which  will  be  headed  by  women. 
If  women  continue  to  increase  their  proportion  of  the  military  population  (active  duty  and  reserve)  then 
the  presence  of  these  single  mothers  in  the  military  will  require  the  Army  to  provide  more  social  services 
to  alleviate  the  burden  of  care  for  children  while  parents  are  away  on  duty. 

Hispanics  will  be  the  largest  minority  group,  with  an  expected  total  of  44.4  million;  followed  by 
blacks  with  41.9  million;  and  Asians  with  13.3  million.  Hispanics  will  be  concentrated  in  the  West  and 
Southwest;  Asians,  in  the  West  and  Northeast;  and  blacks,  in  the  Southeast  and  Northeast. 

Immigration  has  been  one  of  the  key  factors  to  the  nation’s  population  growth  and  that  trend  will 
continue  up  to  the  year  2000.  Most  future  immigrants  will  continue  to  be  Asian  and  Hispanic.  Asians 
who  immigrate  will  do  so  mainly  because  of  relatives  in  the  United  States;  others  will  go  to  other 
prosperous  Asian  countries  close  to  home,  or  to  Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  Canada.  Hispanics  will 
continue  to  cross  over  the  U.S.  southern  borders  as  long  as  abject  poverty  and  political  instability  prevail 
in  their  countries.  The  Immigration  Act  of  1990  allows  skilled  Europeans  to  immigrate  to  the  United 
States  but  their  numbers  have  been  small  and  will,  in  all  likelihood,  remain  small.  Those  who  are 
economically  despondent  will  queue  to  cross  over  the  borders  of  more  affluent  European  countries,  close 
to  home. 

The  United  States  is  expected  to  have  303.4  million  people  in  2015.  Given  a  level  of  prosperity 
that  is  much  higher  than  the  Third  World,  continued  high  immigration  into  the  United  States  is  projected. 
This  situation,  coupled  with  high  birth  and  low  death  rates,  could  bring  the  U.S.  population  to  a  larger 
number  of  320.5  million;  the  number  of  Hispanics  in  this  case  would  be  about  48  million.  On  the  other 
hand,  if  improving  conditions  --  political  stability  and  prosperity  --  prevail  elsewhere,  the  U.S. 
immigration  rate  would  become  less  significant.  And  with  lower  birth  and  higher  death  rates,  the  total 
population  could  be  as  low  as  265. 1  million;  in  this  scenario,  the  number  of  Hispanics  would  grow  only 
to  28.5  million. 

Most  of  the  national  population  growth  will  be  attributed  to  ethnic  minorities.  Growing  sizes  of 
ethnic  groups  will  put  increasing  pressure  on  many  basic  institutions,  including  the  Army.  A  greater 
challenge  will  be  posed  to  the  old  beliefs  in  inclusion,  acculturation,  and  nondiscrimination.  Of  particular 


41 


interest  to  the  army  will  be  young  people,  ages  18  to  25.  In  this  cohort,  whites  will  represent  55.5 
percent  of  total  in  2015,  a  decline  from  67. 1  percent  in  1990.  By  contrast,  the  minorities  will  grow  from 
32.9  percent  in  1990  to  44.5  percent  in  2015. 

To  attract  ethnic  minorities,  especially  the  increasing  number  of  Hispanics  (the  potential  number 
of  white  recruits  will  decline),  the  Army  will  have  to  improve  its  recruitment  tactics;  providing  potential 
Hispanic  recruits  with  special  training,  including  the  English  language,  will  be  one  of  these  tactical  plans. 
The  Army  will  also  have  to  institute  new  programs  to  encourage  and  accelerate  the  process  of  acceptance, 
fostering  greater  cooperation  among  diverse  ethnic  groups. 

The  effects  of  the  AIDS  epidemic  will  persist  through  the  forecast  period.  Because  about  80,000 
women  of  child-bearing  age  may  prove  to  be  HIV-positive,  between  1,500  to  2,000  babies  born  each  year 
could  be  HIV-positive.  By  2015,  many  Army  recruits  will  be  found  HIV-positive. 

In  sum,  what  will  the  U.S.  Army  see  as  its  manpower  pool  in  2015?  The  number  of  potential 
Hispanic  and  Asian  recruits  will  be  much  higher  than  at  present,  with  percentages  of  white  and  black 
youth  decreasing  and  remaining  roughly  the  same,  respectively.  Many  more  will  come  from  single-parent 
households  and  originate  in  the  south  and  west  of  the  United  States.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 


THE  ECONOMY 


—  The  decade  of  the  1990s  will  be  one  of  rigorous  examination  and  future  development  will 
depend  on  how  the  economy  adapts  to  the  globalized  economy,  the  degree  of  relaxation  in  traditional 
U.S.  laissez-faire  policy  toward  commerce,  and  the  ability  of  the  economy  to  maintain  productivity  (with 
concommitant  productivity  of  the  labor  pool). 

—  Changes  affecting  the  U.S.  economy  will  continue  to  occur  at  accelerated  speed  because, 
barring  cataclysmic  setback,  economic  conditions  are  closely  linked  with  technological  advancement. 

—  A  major  factor  in  economic  success  will  be  the  feasibility  of  continuous  expansion  of  the  world 
economy  to  the  benefit  of  all,  and  the  internal  political  feasibility  of  exposing  U.S.  enterprises  and  labor 
to  the  increasingly  transnational  system. 

—  Continued  automation  of  the  goods  producing  sector  is  foreseen.  A  major  factor  will  be  the 
ability  of  producers  to  capture  and  hold  fragmented  and  specialized  markets.  If  there  is  hesitation  then 
producers  may  be  pushed  toward  basic  products  and  away  from  high  tech,  ceding  the  latter  to  foreign 
competitors. 

—  Quantity  of  labor,  certain  to  decrease,  will  be  secondary  to  quality  of  labor,  much  less  certain. 
Further  automation  will  expand  job  markets  for  workers  with  high  technical  training  and  for  those  with 
basic  unspecialized  skills;  the  ratio  to  be  determined  by  demands  posed  by  new  technology.  Workers  in 
the  middle  levels  may  well  be  less  in  demand. 

—  The  military  economy  will  be  adjusting  to  a  smaller  force  structure  and  will  be  increasingly 
dependent  on  high-tech  weaponry.  The  adjustment  period  will  include  co-production  with  at  least  some 
now  exclusively  civilian  producers  and  away  from  isolated  production  of  highly  specialized  items.  Budget 
considerations  and  perception  of  the  threat  will  drive  the  military  sector.

THE  ECONOMY  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  IN  2015 


INTRODUCTION 

The  condition  of  the  U.S.  economy  in  the  next  25  years  will  be  determined  by  a  number  of 
variables  and  trends,  some  intrinsic  to  the  field  of  economics  and  some  external.  Factors  such  as 
investment  policy  and  economic  globalization  are  joined  by  the  condition  of  the  U.S.  education  system 
and  demographic  trends,  for  example,  in  forming  a  complex  balance  of  possible  outcomes.  Likewise, 
the  trends  that  will  have  impact  during  that  period  are  now  at  various  stages  of  development,  and  some 
in  fact  are  not  visible  at  all  at  the  present  time.  One  can  predict  securely,  however,  that  one  trend  will 
continue:  changes  affecting  the  U.S.  economy  will  continue  to  occur  at  accelerated  speed  because,  barring 
a  cataclysmic  setback,  economic  conditions  are  closely  linked  with  technological  advancement. 

Within  that  context,  the  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  identify  and  describe  the  prospective  general 
impact  of  a  small  number  of  key  issues,  then  to  estimate  the  prospective  impact  on  U.S.  Army  policy  of 
the  economic  conditions  created.  The  key  issues  are  the  relative  proportion  of  the  economy  occupied  by 
service  and  manufacturing  sectors,  and  growth  rates  of  each;  changes  in  U.S.  management  practice  and 
the  availability  and  quality  of  the  U.S.  work  force;  enterprise  structure  and  location  patterns;  the  U.S. 
role  in  the  global  economic  system;  changes  in  economic  planning  and  investment  philosophy;  and  the 
relationship  between  the  defense  and  civilian  sectors  of  the  economy.  Future  scenarios  and  the  driver 
factors  for  them  will  be  discussed.  In  such  an  assessment,  the  variety  of  scenarios  matches  the  formidable 
breadth  of  creditable  opinions,  theories,  and  measurement  techniques  in  current  economic  thought. 

STRUCTURE  OF  THE  ECONOMY 

The  economy  is  conventionally  divided  into  manufacturing  and  service  sectors.  The  former 
includes  plant  production  of  tangible  products,  mining,  and  construction.  The  latter  yields  a  wide  variety 
of  activities,  such  as  sales,  communications,  equipment  servicing,  finance,  transportation,  information 
supply,  food  services,  and  education-some  of  which  directly  or  indirectly  facilitate  the  transfer  of  goods 
(such  as  sales)  and  some  of  which  are  essentially  separate  from  the  process  of  goods  exchange  (such  as 
education). 

The  1980s  was  a  decade  of  drastic  retrenchment  and  reshaping  in  U.S.  manufacturing,  although 
the  overall  economy  grew  by  all  measurements.  Enterprises  such  as  U.S.  Steel  and  the  Caterpillar  heavy 
equipment  company,  bastions  of  U.S.  conventional  manufacturing,  slashed  their  operations  but  greatly 
increased  per  capita  productivity.  The  large  construction  firms  that  built  giant  malls  and  plants  through 


47 


the  1980s  began  to  shrink  in  proportion  to  the  smaller  scale  of  new  projects. 

Trend  predictions  in  the  manufacturing  sector  for  the  1990s  vary.  According  to  one  scenario, 
the  United  States  will  react  to  foreign  manufacturing  competition  with  a  reinvigorated  industrial  output, 
signaling  the  end  of  the  post-industrial  era.  [82]  This  renaissance  would  stem  from  a  vast  and  assumedly 
judicious  investment  (one  estimate  says  $55  billion  by  2000)  in  plant  automation.  Automating  factories 
could  preserve  manufacturing’s  20  percent  (1987)  contribution  to  the  GNP  and  weaken  the  advantage  of 
low-wage  foreign  competitors  by  making  U.S.  industry  less  labor-dependent.  Another  key  ingredient  of 
this  scenario  is  industry’s  willingness  to  retool  existing  plants  to  accommodate  changing  demand  in  a 
world  market  increasingly  geared  to  such  accommodation. 

Other  forecasters  see  unaddressed  flaws  such  as  short-sighted  planning  and  investment,  neglect 
of  personnel  retraining,  and  inappropriate  application  of  technology  that  could  cause  the  U.S. 
manufacturing  system  to  decline  in  the  next  decade,  especially  in  comparison  with  Asian  and  European 
competitors.  In  this  scenario,  lack  of  flexibility  will  continue  to  block  broad  retooling  in  the  next  decade, 
just  as  markets  for  steel,  machine  tools,  and  electronics,  among  other  products,  were  lost  to  overseas 
producers  in  the  1980s.  [72] 

A  major  criticism  of  U.S.  industrial  policy  bears  on  future  scenarios  in  the  manufacturing  sector: 
U.S.  industrial  R&D  policy  has  supported  new-product  breakthrough  development  at  the  expense  of 
maintaining  the  production  processes  that  come  later.  The  low-profit  stage  of  pursuing  and  perfecting 
existing  products,  necessary  to  develop  a  long-term  market,  is  thus  sacrificed  for  the  short-term  profits 
associated  with  breakthroughs.  Such  a  focus  often  leaves  ready-made  product  markets  to  foreign 
competitors.  An  example  was  the  video-recorder,  developed  in  the  United  States  but  abandoned  because 
early  machines  had  limited  applicability  and  the  eventual  commercial  success  of  the  product  required 
years  more  of  design  adjustment. 

The  M.I.T.  Commission  on  Industrial  Productivity,  formed  in  1988,  identified  changes  necessary 
to  alleviate  such  competitive  disadvantages.  Streamlined  management  teams  and  worker  input  would 
promote  flexibility  and  responsiveness  to  markets;  simultaneous  improvement  of  product  quality  and 
marketing  would  maintain  markets  beyond  the  short  term;  and  more  direct  connection  with  market  signals 
would  improve  industry  responsiveness  to  fast-changing  demand.  [16]  Amid  any  new  emphasis  on 
maintaining  commercial  markets,  ideally  the  United  States  would  retain  its  breakthrough  design  capacity, 
an  activity  in  which  it  still  leads  the  world  in  many  fields. 

Because  many  other  analyses  have  identified  similar  needs,  the  degree  to  which  they  are  filled 
is  an  important  determinant  of  future  U.S.  market  shares  in  the  manufacturing  industries  where  ground 
was  lost  in  the  1980s.  Already  in  1990,  basic  industries  such  as  construction  materials  and  textiles  had 
regained  substantial  shares  of  international  markets  by  improving  production  efficiency,  tightening  quality 
control,  and  paring  overhead-but  optimism  was  curbed  by  the  yet  undetermined  role  of  a  lower  exchange 
value  of  the  dollar  in  the  demand  for  U.S.  goods  abroad.  Although  the  reversal  occurred  mainly  in  non- 
critical  industries,  in  1990  the  United  States  recorded  its  first  trade  surplus  in  semiconductors  in  several 
years. 


48 


For  the  forecast  period,  several  consumption  factors  will  likely  determine  the  emphasis  of  U.S. 
manufacturing:  disposable  income,  longer  service  life  in  durable  goods,  and  long-term  societal  attitudes 
toward  consumption  of  such  goods.  (The  supply-side  theorists,  on  the  other  hand,  stress  that  consumption 
is  fueled  by  availability  of  goods,  which  if  true  would  at  least  partly  negate  the  foregoing  influences.) 
Disposable  income  could  be  reduced  for  a  large  part  of  the  U.S.  population  if  health  care  costs  continue 
to  consume  a  greater  portion  of  income-a  scenario  predicted  by  many  unless  a  new  health  care  system 
is  devised.  Production  cost  reduction  has  already  shrunk  wages  in  many  goods-production  industries, 
putting  a  potential  long-term  squeeze  on  blue-collar  purchasing  power. 

In  one  scenario,  the  high-consumption  1980s  will  be  followed  by  a  decade  of  conservatism 
(encouraged  by  slow  economic  growth)  and  saving.  The  baby-boom  generation,  already  well-supplied 
with  durable  goods,  would  support  that  trend  by  emphasizing  savings  over  consumption  spending.  That 
might  mean  redistribution  of  resources  away  from  non-durable  manufacturing  and  some  types  of  services 
into  long-term  investment. 

On  the  other  hand,  given  continued  high  consumer  demand,  the  emphasis  of  consumer 
production  should  continue  changing  from  mass-produced  to  individualized  goods  (e.g.  minivans  and  off¬ 
road  vehicles  rather  than  standard  family  cars),  fragmenting  the  market  and  requiring  more 
compartmentalization  of  production  operations.  [9]  Flat  or  decreased  demand  for  durable  goods  (both 
often-predicted  scenarios)  would  likely  narrow  the  U.S.  field  to  the  most  flexible  and  innovative 
producers  after  2000,  with  foreign  suppliers  increasing  their  market  shares. 

In  general,  a  scenario  of  U.S.  industrial  technology  continuing  to  move  abroad  in  the  next  decade 
would  mean  the  United  States  making  fewer  high-value  products  and,  as  a  result,  less  domestic  circulation 
of  economic  wealth.  The  capital  equipment  industry,  for  example,  should  thrive  past  2000  because  of 
the  large  amount  of  outdated  machines  that  U.S.  industry  will  have  to  replace  in  the  next  decade.  But 
segments  of  that  industry  such  as  machine  tool  manufacture  are  already  dominated  by  Japan,  and  in  1985 
U.S.  machine  firms  were  already  buying  25  percent  of  their  steel  abroad.  [72] 

Standards  such  as  growth  in  per  capita  manufacturing  productivity  and  growth  in  percentage  of 
GNP  put  into  capital  investment  support  the  prediction  that  the  sector  can  "turn  the  corner"  by  shedding 
inefficient  operations,  adopting  new  product  lines  in  a  timely  fashion,  and  fine-tuning  and  refitting 
existing  systems.  In  the  context  of  the  domestic  economy,  such  strategy  could  preserve  the  manufacturing 
share  of  the  GNP  well  beyond  2000.  But  this  scenario  may  be  based  on  an  artificial  environment:  given 
the  virtually  universal  prediction  that  no  national  economy  will  preserve  even  present  levels  of  policy¬ 
making  autonomy  in  the  next  25  years,  evaluation  of  the  manufacturing  sector  without  reference  to  trends 
and  policies  in  Japan,  Western  Europe,  or  emerging  Asian  industrial  states  ignores  a  complex  of  key 
determinants.  It  also  ignores  the  speed  with  which  those  competitors  seize  new  markets  if  they  perceive 
slack  in  them.  An  example  with  likely  impact  beyond  2000  is  biotechnology--a  field  pioneered  by  the 
United  States  but,  following  a  U.S.  funding  reduction  in  the  late  1980s,  now  receiving  substantial  long¬ 
term  Japanese  commitment.  [63]  In  the  year  2000,  the  frequency  and  magnitude  of  shifts  that  have 
occurred  in  such  key  pioneer  industries  in  the  preceding  decade  will  show  the  wisdom  of  the  "fine- 


49 


tuning,"  gradual  approach  to  reform  of  U.S.  manufacturing. 

Forecasts  see  as  much  as  90  percent  of  the  U.S.  work  force  in  the  service  sector  in  2000,  up 
from  40  percent  in  1964.  [72]  Figure  1  shows  the  trend  in  relative  employment  between  services  and 
manufacturing.  Even  given  a  scenario  of  resurgence  in  the  manufacturing  sector  in  the  next  25  years, 
process  automation  may  well  reduce  job  slots  in  that  sector  at  a  faster  rate  than  overall  operations  can 
expand,  meaning  a  net  job  shift  away  from  manufacturing.  Slumps  and  advances  in  the  services  have 
been  consistently  more  moderate  than  those  in  manufacturing-if  that  well-established  trend  continues, 
future  service  dominance  of  theeconomy  would  tend  to  moderate  overall  economic  swings,  perhaps 
making  the  U.S.  economy  more  recession-proof. 

The  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  foresees  particular  growth  in  financial,  health,  and  recreation 
services  in  the  1990s.  [75]  According  to  the  Department  of  Labor,  fourteen  of  the  thirty  fastest  growing 
occupations  during  that  decade  will  be  health-related.  For  an  economy  moving  strongly  toward  services, 
productivity  growth  is  much  more  problematic  than  for  an  economy  more  recently  industrialized,  where 
services  provide  a  smaller  portion  of  employment  and  the  recent  introduction  of  modern  production 
equipment  yields  rapid  statistical  jumps  in  productivity.  [4]  After  the  year  2000,  U.S.  service 
productivity  growth  will  be  an  important  determinant  of  economic  health,  both  domestic  and  international. 
Because  that  growth  has  been  virtually  flat  in  recent  decades,  one  post-2000  scenario  is  a  U.S.  economy 
dominated  by  service  enterprises  that  contribute  minimal  growth,  cancel  whatever  gains  might  be  made 
in  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  ultimately  halt  growth  in  the  national  standard  of  living.  Such  a  scenario 
presumes  that  intrinsic  elements  of  inefficiency  will  remain  in  major  service  sectors;  it  is  based  partly  on 
the  fact  that  average  labor  cost  in  services  is  67  percent  of  the  average  in  manufacturing,  meaning  that 
services  are  less  likely  to  improve  productivity  by  replacing  people  with  machines.  [4]  Low  productivity 
is  found,  for  example,  in  conventional  health  care,  where  the  process  of  product  delivery  may  bear  little 
relation  to  the  purely  economic  part  of  the  service  transaction.  Care  of  the  elderly,  an  undoubtedly 
growing  part  of  health  services  in  the  next  25  years,  has  many  aspects  of  such  inefficiency. 

A  second,  more  positive  scenario  sees  streamlining  and  technology  improving  productivity 
(efficiency)  in  services  without  lowering  product  quality.  For  health  care,  automated  self-service  for 
routine  medical  testing  is  a  possible  device  to  streamline  the  conventional  office  visit.  Computerized 
classrooms,  direct  sales,  and  computerized  supermarket  checkouts  are  existing  examples  of  the  trend  that 
can  be  expected  to  multiply  in  the  next  25  years.  [4] 


50 


51 


A  third  scenario  finds  services  occupying  a  stable  portion  of  the  economy  after  the  year  2000, 
meaning  that  the  influence  of  growth  rates  in  that  sector  would  also  stabilize  (albeit  at  a  high  level). 
Service  productivity  may  also  increase  when  faced  with  international  competition,  the  same  stimulant  that 
some  scenarios  see  reviving  U.S.  manufacturing.  Financial  and  communications  services,  for  example, 
increasingly  will  be  forced  to  improve  to  meet  world  competition.  There  is  seemingly  room  for 
improvement:  service  productivity  in  Germany  is  now  much  higher  than  that  in  the  United  States.  [82] 
Exposure  to  domestic  competition  may  have  the  same  result  in  some  services;  transportation  and 
education  are  services  traditionally  shielded  from  market  competition,  but  potentially  streamlined  by 
deregulation  (transportation)  or  privatization  (education). 

An  argument  has  been  made  that  many  of  the  largest  service  areas  have  self-limiting 
characteristics  that  will  cause  a  labor  shift  back  into  manufacturing.  Only  a  certain  number  of  restaurant 
meals  can  be  eaten,  for  example,  and  cost  may  limit  expansion  of  the  health  industry.  A  tight  post-2000 
labor  market  could  shrink  the  service  labor  pool,  forcing  greater  capital  investment  and  from  that  higher 
productivity.  [82] 

Another  aspect  of  the  prospective  relationship  of  manufacturing  and  services  is  the  likelihood 
of  increased  integration  between  the  two  sectors.  In  the  future,  traditional  manufacturing  operations  will 
become  more  dependent  on  rapid  access  to  information  about  design  and  marketing,  effective 
communications  networks,  and  training  for  personnel  operating  sophisticated  equipment.  The  Bureau  of 
Labor  Statistics  expects  communications  equipment  to  be  the  fastest  growing  type  of  durable  equipment 
purchase  by  producers  in  the  1990s  [75];  the  services  rendered  by  the  operators  of  communications 
networks  will  bond  manufacturing  to  that  part  of  the  service  economy  for  the  foreseeable  future. 

How  will  new  balances  between  and  within  the  manufacturing  and  service  sectors  influence  Army 
policy  between  the  years  2000  and  2015?  The  scenario  of  a  manufacturing  sector  continuing  to  lose 
markets  to  overseas  competitors  and  contributing  a  shrinking  share  to  the  U.S.  GNP  would  restrict 
defense  purchasing  options  and  likely  shrink  the  contribution  of  U.S. -based  R&D  and  manufacturing  to 
defense  projects.  This  scenario  would  include  loss  of  defense-vital  production  facilities  in  electronics, 
machine  tools,  and  semiconductors  (as  well  as  other  technologies  developed  between  now  and  2015)  to 
Asian  or  European  competitors,  meaning  new  dependence  on  suppliers  beyond  direct  U.S.  control.  On 
the  other  hand,  shrinkage  of  the  manufacturing  contribution  to  GNP  would  not  by  itself  imply  damage 
to  the  industrial  base  of  the  military.  Especially  given  a  scenario  of  improved  productivity  and  continued 
expansion  in  the  service  sector,  a  drop  from  the  current  20  percent  share  of  manufacturing  could  be 
perfectly  acceptable  if  it  also  meant  that  manufacturing  had  improved  qualitatively.  This  would  require 
more  accurate  and  rapid  assessment  of  market  changes,  flexible  retooling  to  meet  them,  and  greater 
commitment  to  programs  of  R&D  and  continuous  process  improvement.  A  manufacturing  sector  that  has 
accomplished  those  objectives  by  2000  would  have  retained  substantial  parts  of  the  defense-vital  industries 
or  overseen  their  distribution  abroad  from  a  position  of  strength  rather  than  weakness.  It  would  be 
technologically  ready  for  new  production  assignments,  either  civilian  or  military.  The  scenario  of  natural 
re-expansion  of  U.S.  manufacturing  through  2015  might  enhance  that  capability,  depending  on  whether 


52 


consumer  products  or  heavier  industries  were  the  chief  areas  of  expansion. 

For  the  military  economy  to  take  full  advantage  of  this  stronger  manufacturing  sector,  however, 
substantial  adjustment  would  have  to  limit  the  present  de  facto  separation  of  military  and  civilian 
manufacturing.  The  dynamics  of  that  relationship  will  be  discussed  in  more  detail  in  a  later  section. 

The  impact  of  service  sector  trends  on  the  military  is  less  dramatic  and  direct.  If  productivity 
growth  in  that  sector  remains  flat  or  negative  in  the  next  25  years,  however,  U.S.  economic  power,  hence 
international  prestige,  will  diminish  because  of  the  continued  influence  of  services  on  overall  economic 
health.  Conversely,  if  technological  advancement  affects  enough  major  service  industries  in  a  major  way, 
service  productivity  might  begin  to  grow  by  2  percent  annually,  providing  an  economic  boost  that  would 
enhance  the  U.S.  position  after  the  year  2000.  The  outcome  between  those  alternatives  (likely  to  fall 
somewhere  in  the  middle)  will  influence  the  flexibility  of  military  funding  and,  conceivably,  the 
geopolitical  climate  in  which  the  military  operates.  The  increased  involvement  of  services  such  as 
communications,  training,  and  information  in  U.S.  manufacturing  means  that  the  productivity  and 
technical  proficiency  of  such  services  also  has  impact  on  the  military.  The  degree  of  this  impact  will  be 
determined  by  the  degree  to  which  military  and  civilian  industry  converge  in  the  next  25  years.  If  the 
military  economy  remains  essentially  separate,  changes  in  the  civilian  service  sector  will  have  less  impact 
because  functions  such  as  software  development  and  engineering  and  operation  of  computers  and 
telecommunications  equipment  will  be  insulated  from  trends  in  the  civilian  economy.  The  advantage  of 
such  insulation  may  decrease  if  the  civilian  economy  yields  improved  service  techniques  that  might  have 
to  be  re-invented  at  greater  expense,  or  even  foregone,  on  the  military  side.  If  substantial  crossover 
occurs  between  the  years  2000  and  2015,  however,  the  efficiency  level  of  those  services  in  the  overall 
economy  can  carry  over  into  military  applications. 


MANAGEMENT  AND  THE  WORK  FORCE 

For  a  number  of  reasons,  the  conventional  hierarchical  management  pyramid  has  been  modified 
in  many  U.S.  enterprises  in  recent  decades.  Figure  2  depicts  how  the  pyramid  is  being  modified.  The 
middle  management  level  of  the  pyramid  is  disappearing  in  two  directions:  part  of  it  is  simply  becoming 
unemployed,  another  part  is  moving  from  purely  bureaucratic  functions  to  hands-on,  "value-added" 
positions  that  emphasize  direct  decision  making  and  operational  control  over  personnel  supervision.  [68] 
The  pyramid  is  being  flattened  partly  to  provide  faster  information  flow  to  and  from  the  top,  to  and  from 
customers  and  staff.  Reducing  the  number  of  organizational  levels  promotes  teamwork,  speeds  product 
development,  and  allows  flexible,  rapid  response  to  market  changes.  It  also  reflects  the  rising  post¬ 
industrial  concept  that  ideas  themselves  are  products  with  economic  value.  The  new  structures  often 
require  supervisory  and  non-supervisory  personnel,  trained  to  function  in  diverse  capacities,  to  cross  the 
lines  of  conventional  job  descriptions.  [16]

In  the  next  25  years  management  positions  are  likely  to  undergo  more  qualitative  changes.  [79] 
Managers  increasingly  will  be  expected  to  be  competent  in  a  variety  of  skills,  especially  aware  of  market 
trends  and  new  technologies,  able  to  exert  leadership  and  gather  information  outside  the  context  of  a 
rigidly  defined  hierarchy,  and  ready  to  share  decision  making  with  labor.  As  more  information  flows 
through  automated  channels  than  through  human  management  structures,  computer  literacy  becomes  a 
prime  requisite  for  managers.  Also,  a  higher  portion  of  management  is  likely  to  be  women  in  the  next 
25  years— both  because  of  overall  workforce  demographics  and  because  of  the  breakdown  of  the  male- 
dominated  management  pyramid.  This  will  be  especially  true  in  the  service  and  information  industries. 
The  rapidity  of  the  last  change  will  be  determined  by  both  economic  factors  (will  it  be  possible  for  the 
average  family  to  live  on  one  income?)  and  social  attitudes  (will  a  traditionalist  backlash  pull  some 
women  back  out  of  the  work  force?)  [7] 

Part  of  the  basis  of  the  management-restructuring  scenario  is  increased  input  by  labor  into 
management  decision  making.  An  alternative  scenario  finds  labor  and  management  striving  for  greater 
cooperation  and  flexible  organization  in  the  name  of  improved  competitiveness,  but  resorting  to  traditional 
adversarial  labor-management  relations  when  short-term  profit-maximizing  management  refuses  to  take 
the  risk  of  a  new  corporate  structure.  [55]  While  the  traditional  structure  is  resistant  to  change,  foreign 
competition  and  the  necessity  that  management  gain  all  possible  information  input  are  drivers  whose 
strength  is  likely  to  increase  by  the  year  2000,  leading  to  the  triumph  of  the  "we’re  all  in  this  together" 
attitude. 

The  breakdown  of  conventional  structures  also  applies  to  the  work  force.  In  the  manufacturing 
sector,  the  use  of  automated  equipment  will  be  maximized  in  the  next  25  years  because  in  the  long  term 
it  increases  productivity,  a  key  indicator  of  economic  health.  The  main  question  here  is  the  rate  at  which 
this  process  will  proceed  in  the  next  25  years.  Between  1973  and  1988,  the  amount  of  labor  man-hours 
required  to  produce  a  given  volume  of  goods  decreased  by  150  percent.  Because  major  manufacturing 
industries  such  as  steel  still  held  large  amounts  of  conventional  equipment  in  1990,  [72]  the  rate  of 
replacement  is  likely  to  increase  over  the  next  10  to  25  years.  In  this  process,  many  job  categories  will 
simply  disappear  in  the  forecast  period  and  leave  a  large  group  of  workers  unprepared  for  alternative 
employment  in  their  newly  high-tech  industries.  Many  of  those  relatively  high-paying  manufacturing  jobs 
will  be  replaced  in  the  economy  by  lower-paying  service  jobs.  According  to  one  frequent  prediction, 
both  service  and  manufacturing  job  categories  will  divide  dramatically  into  tedious,  low-paying  positions 
with  little  prospect  for  advancement  and  technical  jobs  requiring  a  relatively  high  degree  of  education  or 
training.  Jobs  in  the  service  sector  show  a  more  steady  two-track,  or  bimodal,  trend.  A  dramatic 
example  of  removal  of  a  middle  layer  between  those  extremes  is  the  "paper-shuffling"  occupations 
(clerical,  processing,  and  manipulation),  which  now  are  an  estimated  16  percent  of  the  work  force.  Given 
the  scenario  of  rapid  automation,  this  occupation  will  be  largely  replaced  by  information  technology  by 
the  year  2000.  [9] 

Another  scenario,  however,  severely  downplays  the  bimodal  outlook  and  foresees  more  gradual 
evolution  in  the  structure  of  the  labor  force,  mainly  because  of  the  huge  initial  cost  of  replacing  labor- 


55 


intensive  production  with  sophisticated,  capital-intensive  methods.  This  scenario  would  have  robots 
performing  only  the  most  repetitive  and  hazardous  tasks  and  thus  replacing  only  a  small  fraction  of  the 
labor  force  by  the  year  2000,  thus  cushioning  the  social  and  economic  shock  of  sudden  conversion.  [55] 

Given  a  scenario  of  rapid  introduction  of  technology  such  as  information  networks  and  robots 
into  U.S.  enterprises,  the  "shakedown"  period  in  management  and  personnel  structure  might  be  ending 
by  2000.  That  would  not  mean  the  end  of  technological  improvement  in  enterprises,  but  the  slowing  of 
human  displacement  by  machines.  In  that  case,  the  period  through  2015  would  be  one  of  consolidation 
and  fine-tuning  for  the  human  element  of  the  U.S.  production  system.  Given  the  scenario  of 
technological  transformation  slowed  by  a  shortage  of  investment  funds  (the  rapid-automation  scenarios 
most  often  omit  the  very  high  cost  of  the  technological  revolution  that  is  to  save  U.S.  productivity), 
prolonged  economic  downturn,  or  a  lack  of  qualified  technicians,  the  displacement  process  and  its 
attendant  insecurity  and  social  disruption  (see  "Society")  would  be  more  gradual  and  extend  into  the  21st 
century. 

Substantial  shifts  can  also  be  expected  in  the  quality  and  quantity  of  available  labor  in  the  next 
25  years.  The  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  forecasts  that  by  the  year  2000,  managerial,  professional,  and 
technical  occupations  will  be  the  fastest-increasing  employment  categories.  [79]  But  the  proportion  of 
such  positions  to  the  overall  labor  force  will  be  determined  by  another  driver:  the  extent  to  which  "smart" 
machines  eliminate  the  need  for  "smart"  operators.  Very  likely  that  replacement  will  accelerate  between 
2000  and  2015,  but  its  rate  will  be  determined  by  the  pace  of  technological  innovation  and  onsite 
replacement  of  equipment.  Meanwhile,  people  qualified  in  more  than  one  of  the  premium  categories  (e.g. 
business  and  computers)  will  be  in  especially  great  demand. 

Labor  availability  for  the  in-demand  categories  will  be  determined  by  several  factors. 
Demographic  factors  will  likely  limit  growth  in  quantity  of  U.S.  laborers  to  around  1  percent  in  the  next 
ten  years,  compared  with  1.8  percent  in  the  1980s.  (The  same  gross  population  factor  will  also  limit 
demand  in  that  period,  another  serious  impact  on  the  economy.)  By  2015,  however,  the  large  number 
of  women  of  childbearing  age  in  the  current  population  will  cause  a  new  jump  in  the  number  of  young 
workers,  who  will  also  be  consumers  (see  Fig.  3).  [16]  Within  the  gross  number,  however,  other  factors 
drive  the  participation  rate  of  women,  young  workers,  and  older  cohorts.  The  female  labor  force  is  likely 
to  grow  more  slowly  after  dramatic  growth  in  the  1980s,  and  a  social  backlash  in  favor  of  earlier 
motherhood  and  women  in  the  home  (see  "Society")  could  slow  the  trend  even  more  after  the  year  2000. 
If  more  older  workers  of  the  period  (highly  motivated  baby-boomers  still)  elect  to  delay  retirement,  they 
could  contribute  stability  and  adaptability  to  the  top  levels  of  the  work  force.  The  number  of  trained 
young  workers  available  in  the  next  25  years  is  problematic,  however.  Until  about  2010,  their  age  cohort 
is  smaller  than  the  one  that  supported  economic  growth  by  swelling  the  labor  force  in  the  1980s.  [31] 
But  if  the  expense  of  college  drives  more  prospective  workers  to  shorter,  skill-oriented  training  programs 
or  directly  to  work,  the  participation  rate  of  young  people  in  the  labor  force  would  increase.  [55] 


56 


57 


An  influential  external  driver  here  is  the  effectiveness  of  the  U.S.  education  system  in  keeping 
pace  with  skill  requirements  in  business,  health  services,  information  service,  and  finance.  Conventional 
industrial  on-the-job-training  methods  will  have  lost  applicability  before  the  year  2000.  The  expense  of 
training  new  workers  in  basic  skills  in-house  would  decrease  enterprise  profits,  slow  productivity  growth, 
and  pressure  enterprises  toward  more  rapid  automation  to  recoup  lost  productivity.  But  in  fact,  if 
increasing  numbers  of  entry-level  workers  lack  needed  skills,  precisely  such  a  scenario  might  result. 
After  a  period  of  adjustment  in  such  activity  (ending  around  the  year  2000,  given  rapid  and  relatively 
even  automation  in  the  intervening  decade),  enterprises  may  have  streamlined  in-house  training  to  fill  gaps 
left  by  the  U.S.  education  system  with  minimal  drag  on  productivity. 

A  wild-card  variable  in  labor-force  quality  and  quantity  is  the  rate  and  source  of  immigration. 
The  U.S.  Department  of  labor  projects  that  in  the  next  two  decades  immigrants  will  provide  22  percent 
of  U.S.  labor  growth,  doubling  the  1 1  percent  contribution  of  the  1970s,  when  the  baby  boom  augmented 
the  domestic  labor  force.  Because  the  next  increase  in  domestic  labor  supply  is  not  expected  until  nearly 
2015,  immigrant  labor  will  be  an  important  resource  through  the  forecast  period.  As  they  have  in  recent 
decades,  a  large  majority  of  legal  aliens  will  likely  gravitate  to  urban  employment  centers.  In  the  forecast 
period,  immigrants  with  entry-level  skills  will  increasingly  compensate  for  the  relative  scarcity  of  native- 
born  workers  in  the  16-to-19  age  group.  But  the  labor  force  is  augmented  quite  differently  by  Hispanic 
immigrants  in  the  Southwest,  for  example,  than  it  is  by  Asian  immigrants  in  urban  areas.  Especially  in 
the  bimodal  scenario,  untrained  worker  groups  would  contribute  less  per  capita  to  the  economy  than 
trained  (or  highly  trainable)  workers.  In  the  1980s,  over  one-third  of  U.S.  immigrants  had  some  college 
education.  Dramatically  increased,  geopolitically-driven  immigration  from  Eastern  Europe  or  some  part 
of  Asia  would  serve  to  maintain  that  figure,  which  most  analysts  feel  has  been  beneficial  to  the  economy. 
[31]  On  the  other  hand,  continued  or  increased  Hispanic  immigration  from  Central  and  South  America 
might  swell  an  untrained  group  to  a  size  that  would  be  a  drag  on  the  economy  after  the  year  2000. 

The  increased  emphasis  on  flexibility  (a  seemingly  unidirectional  trend)  will  affect  both  enterprise 
structure  and  the  nature  of  the  labor  force.  As  many  as  ten  job  changes  are  forecast  for  the  career  of  the 
average  worker  beginning  a  career  in  1990.  There  is  the  possibility  of  creating  a  large,  nomadic, 
"disposable”  under-class  of  multipurpose  workers  in  service  industries  specializing  in  short-term, 
customized  work.  Many  of  those  workers  may  be  trapped  at  entry  level  by  their  inability  to  remain  in 
an  organization  long  enough  to  develop  marketable  skills.  Meanwhile,  the  skilled  part  of  the  work  force 
will  also  change  jobs  and  retrain  more  frequently,  but  more  often  as  a  voluntary  step  in  career 
advancement.  The  rate  of  economic  diversification  and  fragmentation  will  determine  the  rate  at  which 
such  disruptions  occur,  but  increasingly  education  will  be  the  key  to  obtaining  job  security,  mobility,  and 
higher  wages.  [55] 

How  might  these  management  and  work-force  scenarios  influence  Army  policy?  If  average 
recruit  age  continues  to  increase,  a  larger  percentage  of  the  force  will  have  prior  exposure  to  the 
prevalent  management  structure  of  their  time,  which  may  be  more  antithetical  than  previously  to  military 
command  hierarchy.  An  increase  in  the  proportion  of  reserve  forces  would  have  the  same  effect.  To 


58 


the  extent  that  the  understanding  of  authority  is  shaped  by  images  such  as  the  conventional  corporate 
structure,  future  recruits  will  come  equipped  with  a  less  homogeneous  picture  of  how  an  organization 
identifies  and  achieves  objectives.  On  the  other  hand,  new  enterprise  structures  may  have  provided  them 
with  self-confidence  and  initiative  lacking  in  personnel  emerging  from  a  more  conventional  organization. 

Work-force  demographic  changes  will  also  have  impact.  By  the  year  2000  shortages  of  young 
workers  will  increase  employment  competition  from  the  private  sector  for  trained  or  trainable  personnel, 
especially  given  a  scenario  where  major  parts  of  the  service  economy  have  moved  into  high-tech  phases 
in  the  next  decade.  On  the  other  hand,  the  bimodal  scenario  would  mean  larger  numbers  of  available 
personnel  whose  skills  match  positions  being  abolished  in  the  new  economic  structure  and  older  workers 
unable  to  retrain  after  their  traditional  jobs  have  disappeared.  On  the  average,  such  a  pool  of  available 
manpower  might  be  older  and  less  educated,  which  might  influence  its  attitude  toward  military  service 
and  its  trainability. 


ENTERPRISE  STRUCTURE 

As  already  indicated,  a  major  trend  in  the  next  25  years  will  be  fragmentation  and  diversification 
of  production  centers  in  both  manufacturing  and  service  sectors.  Even  large  firms  will  be  subdivided  into 
multiple  establishments  forming  production  networks,  rather  than  transforming  raw  materials  into  a 
finished  product  (in  the  case  of  manufacturing).  Although  the  structure  of  such  networks  will  vary 
widely,  the  general  rationale  for  organizing  enterprises  in  subunits  is  to  achieve  maximum  use  of  energy 
and  materials.  [9] 

In  the  1990s,  greatest  growth  is  likely  to  occur  in  the  number  of  small  and  large  enterprises,  with 
those  of  medium  size  growing  less  rapidly,  just  as  they  did  in  the  1980s-given  reasonably  even  economic 
conditions  during  that  period.  Family  firms  (defined  as  those  that  have  remained  under  control  of  one 
family  for  two  or  more  generations)  produced  60  percent  of  the  U.S.  GNP  in  1989,  and,  barring  a 
prolonged  economic  downturn  in  the  next  decade,  the  profitability  and  proliferation  of  such  enterprises 
are  expected  to  increase  past  2000.  This  trend  coincides  with  the  economy’s  overall  move  toward  closer 
contact  with  customers  and  more  customization  of  service  and  goods,  and  with  a  tendency  in  society 
toward  conventional  family  values  and  regaining  control  of  financial  levers,  after  a  decade  of  takeovers 
and  mergers  created  the  perception  of  concentration  of  wealth  in  large,  impersonal  corporations.  The 
small  firm  also  provides  challenging  employment  for  white  collar  workers  released  in  the  management 
cutbacks  of  the  large  corporations.  [23] 

Evolution  from  larger  units  to  smaller  is  not  necessarily  permanent,  however.  The  1990s  will 
likely  see  great  experimentation  with  enterprise  size  and  especially  configuration,  corresponding  to  the 
introduction  of  entirely  new  product  lines  and  production  processes.  For  example,  manufacturing 
operations  may  be  merged  with  engineering  and  marketing  operations,  yielding  a  unified  system  of 
physical  process  with  development  on  one  end  and  the  creation  of  economic  value  on  the  other.  [33;59] 


59 


After  adjustments  in  the  1990s,  by  the  year  2000  individual  industries  may  have  established  a  pattern, 
dictated  by  some  of  the  drivers  already  discussed:  the  need  for  rapid  exploitation  of  new  markets  and  new 
technologies,  which  would  limit  enterprise  size  and  complexity  but  put  a  premium  on  flexibility;  and,  on 
the  other  hand,  the  need  for  large-scale  investment  in  new  capital  equipment,  which  would  favor  a  larger 
corporate  structure.  If  regulations  remain  lenient,  mergers  and  takeovers  might  also  continue  to  diversify 
large  parent  corporations  and  make  their  production  networks  more  complex. 

Continuing  mergers  would  mean  that  the  predominance  of  large  and  small  enterprises  would 
continue  because  it  is  predominantly  medium-sized  companies  that  are  consumed  in  mergers.  Also, 
medium-sized  companies  (with,  for  example,  $100  million  in  annual  sales)  typically  show  the  least 
productivity  because  their  volume  requires  a  substantial  labor  force  but  profits  are  not  enough  to  afford 
full-scale  automation.  In  the  next  25  years,  such  firms  will  feel  increasing  pressure  to  increase  capital 
investment  at  the  expense  of  labor;  those  unable  to  do  so  will  disappear  or  merge  with  others.  [4] 

The  geographical  siting  of  economic  enterprises  will  also  shift  in  the  next  25  years. 
Manufacturing  already  demands  much  less  proximity  to  natural  resources  and  conventional  transport  (such 
as  that  provided  by  rivers  and  ports),  and  the  day  of  material-intensive  manufacturing  is  not  likely  to 
return.  As  a  rule,  services  have  always  located  near  their  customers.  Given  continued  technical 
advancement  in  manufacturing  and  services,  availability  of  skilled  labor  and  communications  networks 
will  continue  to  be  prime  factors  in  enterprise  location.  This  would  mean  continued  concentration  of 
high-wage  employment  around  the  metropolitan  areas  of  both  coasts,  as  well  as  certain  parts  of  Texas 
and  the  Southwest  and  isolated  points  such  as  the  industrial  research  centers  of  Michigan  and  Minnesota. 
[9]  But  in  the  next  25  years  some  regions  will  undergo  boom-and-bust  cycles.  The  frequency  of  that 
phenomenon  will  be  driven  by  the  intensity  of  foreign  competition  and  the  pace  of  changes  in  product 
lines  in  individual  industries.  Even  the  powerful  Silicon  Valley  complex  of  high-tech  industries  now  sees 
some  enterprises  threatened  by  Japanese  competition  that  is  expected  to  intensify  before  2000.  [15]  By 
the  year  2000  economic  revival  is  possible  in  the  Midwestern  Rust  Belt  because  of  the  affinity  of  high- 
tech  industries  for  university  research  bases  and  the  trend  for  individual  states  to  make  economic  deals 
directly  with  foreign  enterprises. 

The  fragmentation  of  the  U.S.  economy  into  smaller  dispersed  units  could  have  various  effects 
on  the  long-term  health  of  the  economy,  and  thus  on  resources  available  for  military  programs.  Barring 
a  long-term  economic  slowdown  that  would  dry  up  the  specialized  markets  they  serve,  the  new  small 
businesses  can  contribute  a  healthy  entrepreneurial  spirit  ready  to  foresake  conventional  production 
processes  and  managerial  methodology.  Their  inherently  "lean"  structure  would  also  help  improve 
productivity  in  the  manufacturing  sector  and  enhance  their  contribution  as  subcontractors  for  military 
projects. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  dynamism  of  the  small  companies  depends  on  a  continuous  investment 
flow,  an  increasing  percentage  of  which  will  likely  come  from  foreign  sources  over  the  next  decade.  The 
impact  of  foreign  investment  on  the  U.S.  economy  will  be  discussed  more  fully  in  a  separate  section,  but 
the  degree  to  which  the  economic  structure  remains  fragmented  in  the  year  2000  will  be  an  important 


60 


factor  in  that  variable:  large  numbers  of  smaller  U.S.  companies  with  leading  edge  technology  could  be 
under  foreign  control  in  2000,  potentially  limiting  their  availability  to  military  R&D.  This  is  especially 
important  assuming  continuation  of  the  present  trend  for  major  military  contractors  to  disperse 
subcontracts  widely  among  smaller  firms. 

Changes  in  the  geographical  distribution  of  U.S.  enterprise  centers  will  influence  the 
demographics  of  military  recruitment.  To  the  extent  that  the  mobile,  young  portion  of  the  labor  force 
relocates  in  the  bicoastal  economic  concentration,  attitudes  brought  from  other  regions  will  be 
homogenized  in  ensuing  recruitment  pools.  In  the  Sun  Belt,  economic  immigration  will  have  the  same 
effect  on  indigenous  cultural  patterns  of  the  South  and  Southwest. 


FINANCIAL  AND  INVESTMENT  CONDITIONS 

Together  with  a  slow  rate  of  productivity  growth,  the  unfavorable  U.S.  balance  of  payments, 
budget  deficit  (close  to  $200  billion  in  1990),  and  current  investment  patterns  are  most  often  cited  in 
negative  scenarios  as  evidence  of  long-term  economic  deterioration.  Figure  4  projects  GNP  growth 
through  the  forecast  period.  There  is  a  substantial  consensus  that  the  significant  U.S.  economic  growth 
of  the  1980s  resulted  mainly  from  consistently  high  foreign  capital  investment  in  the  U.S.  ($329  billion 
in  direct  investment  in  1988)  [65],  stimulated  by  the  declining  value  of  the  dollar  and  the  image  of  the 
U.S.  economy  as  a  secure  investment.  Since  the  mid-1980s,  the  U.S.  has  invested  less  in  foreign 
economies  than  they  have  invested  here;  this  borrowing  imbalance,  intensified  by  interest  payments, 
becomes  part  of  an  already  large  U.S.  trade  deficit  ($128  billion  in  1988).  Also,  a  substantial  part  of 
U.S.  foreign  investment  has  gone  to  developing  countries  where  the  return  potential  is  small;  in  the 
1990s,  substantial  U.S.  investment  may  go  to  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Soviet  Union,  also  economically 
risky  ventures  (especially  compared  with  the  return  potential  for  foreign  investors  in  the  United  States). 

Many  also  agree  that  long-term  U.S.  planning  cannot  count  on  such  a  foreign-investment  trend 
continuing,  and  that  a  continued  budget  deficit  (which  has  been  at  least  $150  billion  for  the  last  five 
years)  will  have  long-term  impact  on  domestic  U.S.  capital  investment  resources,  barring  a  combination 
of  higher  taxes  and  federal  program  cuts  having  a  drastic  effect  on  the  deficit.  Wild-card  items  such  as 
the  S&L  bailout  are  also  de  facto  budget  busters  that  have  rather  regularly  disrupted  recent  budget 
forecasts  and  should  be  expected  to  continue. 

Historically,  long-term  projections  of  a  balanced  budget  have  seldom  come  true  because  in  the 
intervening  period  new  or  expanded  government  programs  usually  swallow  more  of  the  budget  than  was 
forecast.  [26]  Despite  the  prospect  of  a  fiscally  conservative  national  administration  keeping  programs 
such  as  food  stamps  and  veterans’  benefits  at  zero  real  growth  through  the  1990s,  no  federal  surplus  is 
likely  to  have  supplemented  available  private  investment  funds  by  the  year  2000-too  many  politically 
popular  programs  will  exist.  The  ineffectiveness  of  the  Gramm-Rudman  procedures  in  paring  budget 
deficits  in  the  late  1980s  supports  that  view.

Warnings  about  over-reliance  on  foreign  capital  are  especially  ominous  when  combined  with 
another  frequent  criticism  of  U.S.  economic  priorities:  that  the  U.S.  stock-exchange-driven  system 
encourages  too  much  spending  on  consumption  and  short-term  profit,  too  little  savings  and  investment. 
In  1989  the  U.S.  savings  rate  was  14.9  percent  of  its  GDP,  compared  with  25.8  percent  for  Japan.  By 
contrast,  consumer  credit  terms  in  the  United  States  are  much  more  lenient  than  in  Japan  and  some 
consumption  interest  is  tax  deductible-diverting  potential  U.S.  savings  and  raising  interest  rates  for 
capital  investment  loans. 

According  to  the  interdisciplinary  private  Council  on  Competitiveness,  in  1989  the  United  States 
was  investing  about  half  the  percentage  of  GDP  that  Japan  was  investing  in  plant  and  equipment,  and 
Japan’s  absolute  investment  total  exceeded  that  of  the  United  States  that  year  as  well,  in  spite  of  the  much 
smaller  size  of  its  economy.  [51]  The  disparity  reflects  a  faster  Japanese  growth  rate,  rather  than  a  lack 
of  growth  in  U.S.  investment;  the  "moderate  projection"  of  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  through  2000 
calls  for  accelerated  growth  in  the  rate  of  U.S.  investment  in  capital  equipment,  especially  in 
communications  and  computer  equipment,  after  an  economic  slowdown  in  the  early  1990s.  [79] 

A  result  of  the  increased  capital  accumulation  in  that  scenario  is  increased  labor  productivity, 
another  statistical  area  where  the  United  States  has  lagged  in  recent  years,  but  where  future  projections 
vary  considerably.  Japan  and  Germany  had  virtually  overtaken  the  United  States  in  per  capita 
productivity  by  1990,  having  steadily  closed  the  gap  in  the  late  1980s.  As  in  other  indicators,  a  U.S.  lag 
is  not  absolute  but  relative  to  performance  of  chief  competitors;  per  capita  productivity  for  U.S.  workers 
rose  $13,000  between  1972  and  1987.  [51]  Crucial  factors  behind  future  productivity  scenarios  are  labor 
distribution  between  low-productivity  services  and  high-productivity  manufacturing,  absolute  amount  of 
available  labor,  and  the  pace  at  which  capital  investment  lifts  productivity  by  improving  equipment. 
Progress  in  reducing  the  U.S.  budget  deficit  will  also  play  a  role,  both  economically  and  psychologically. 
By  the  year  2000  interaction  of  those  factors  will  likely  show  whether  the  optimistic  productivity  scenario 
(2  percent  annual  growth  for  the  1990s)  or  the  pessimistic  scenario  (a  continuation  of  the  1980s 
slowdown,  to  1  percent  or  less  annually)  carries  into  the  next  century.  In  the  latter  case,  output  would 
not  raise  living  standards  or  maintain  government  spending  programs.  Adjusted  for  inflation,  average 
real  hourly  wages  for  U.S.  workers  have  already  been  shrinking  since  1973.  [87] 

Given  no  progress  on  the  deficit,  in  the  year  2000,  the  United  States  might  still  show  prosperity 
in  its  productivity  indicator,  but  the  cost  likely  would  be  increased  foreign  debt  and  foreign-initiated 
foreign  ownership  of  U.S.  production  facilities,  and/or  a  U.S.  industrial  infrastructure  unprepared  by 
long-term  investment  for  world  competition  between  the  years  2000  and  2015.  Among  non-economic 
drivers  of  the  budget  outcome  are  political  feasibility  of  raising  either  income  or  consumption  taxes, 
geopolitical  feasibility  of  sustaining  military  spending  cuts  past  2000,  and  political  feasibility  of  limiting 
the  growth  of  entitlement  programs  in  the  U.S.  budget. 

A  positive  scenario  combines  adjustment  of  U.S.  taxation  policy  to  encourage  domestic  capital 
investment  with  sustained  shrinkage  of  budget  deficits-between  1993  and  2003,  for  example.  The  former 
change  would  likely  cause  a  short-term,  transitional  economic  slowdown,  but  if  made  in  the  next  five 


63 


years  would  likely  provide  a  solid  production  and  R&D  infrastructure  for  expansion  after  2000.  This 
position  of  relative  strength  would  reduce  dependence  on  foreign  investment,  placing  more  U.S.  capital 
in  strategic  knowledge-based  industries  such  as  semiconductors,  electronics,  advanced  materials, 
computers,  aerospace,  telecommunications,  and  financial  services-areas  where  long-term  investment  will 
spill  over  technology  to  other  industries  past  the  year  2000.  [77;84] 

At  some  point  before  2000,  incentives  for  foreign  investment  in  the  United  States  are  likely  to 
weaken;  barring  world  economic  crisis,  drivers  of  this  scenario  are  increased  attractiveness  of  the 
European  Economic  Community  (EEC)  or  Asian  economies  as  investment  ventures,  long-term  currency 
valuation  shifts,  or  politically-driven  economic  policy  changes  by  major  investors  such  as  Japan  and  the 
United  Kingdom.  If  that  happens  before  U.S.  investment  policy  has  shifted,  a  major  economic  crisis 
might  result,  especially  given  the  likelihood  that  U.S  manufacturing  will  then  be  committed  to  a  major 
retooling  process.  Given  that  scenario,  the  period  2000-2015  would  likely  be  a  recovery  period  marked 
by  forced  rechanneling  of  domestic  funds  into  targeted  industries  and  services-a  drastic  weaning  from 
foreign  borrowing  and  the  present  policies  that  encourage  low  savings  and  investment. 

In  terms  of  impact  on  the  military,  continued  growth  in  foreign  investment  in  the  United  States 
through  the  year  2000  would  mean  a  shrinkage  in  the  enterprise  pool  available  for  military  contracts—not 
because  foreign  ownership  per  se  is  a  disqualifier,  but  because  the  cumulative  security  risk  grows  with 
the  percentage  of  foreign  capital.  The  short-term  slowdown  impact  of  rearranging  domestic  investment 
incentives  would  likely  be  cushioned  in  the  specialized  military  sector,  and  beyond  2000  (positing  a 
rearrangement  sometime  in  the  mid-1990s)  such  adjustment  would  ensure  broader  availability  of  military 
technology  from  the  U.S.  economy.  A  recovery  from  the  budget  deficit  will  almost  surely  involve  severe 
military  budget  cuts  in  the  1990s  and  a  continuation  of  reorganization  and  prioritizing  past  2000  (although 
the  outcome  of  Operation  Desert  Storm  uncovered  substantial  remaining  enthusiasm  for  expanded  military 
spending).  The  existing  trend  of  withdrawal  from  military  production  by  U.S.  enterprises  would 
accelerate  if  funding  shrank.  Given  relatively  smooth  conversion  to  a  consistently  smaller  military  portion 
of  GNP  (to  as  little  as  3.6  percent  after  a  peak  of  6.5  percent  in  the  mid-1980s),  by  the  beginning  of  the 
forecast  period  the  Army  will  have  had  several  years  of  adjustment  to  operating  with  fewer  resources. 
In  that  scenario,  by  the  year  2000  austerity  would  likely  force  procurement  of  "off-the-shelf  products, 
which  will  be  discussed  in  a  later  section. 


THE  UNITED  STATES  IN  THE  GLOBAL  ECONOMY 

Accelerated  international  economic  integration  in  the  next  few  decades  is  a  scenario  accepted  in 
one  form  or  another  by  virtually  all  forecasters.  The  dramatic  1992  removal  of  economic  frontiers  within 
the  EEC  is  perhaps  the  most  immediate  example  of  smoothing  the  passage  of  goods  and  services  among 
nation-states.  But  the  1990s  will  likely  bring  equally  dramatic  changes  in  other  parts  of  the  world: 
addition  of  Mexico  to  the  U.S. -Canada  free  trade  agreement  is  under  serious  discussion,  [49]  and  that 


64 


grouping  could  lead  to  complete  economic  unification  of  the  Western  Hemisphere,  or,  farther  in  the 
future,  a  Pacific  Rim  grouping  including  Asian  industrial  powers.  [7]  Newly  industrialized  countries 
(NIC’s)  have  revised  the  world  economic  flow  by  taking  over  basic  mass-production  operations.  This 
means  that  even  after  EEC  unification,  a  number  of  major  economic  players  (Japan,  South  Korea  or  a 
reunified  Korea,  Taiwan,  Singapore,  and  Brazil)  will  remain  dispersed  geographically  and  economically, 
likely  contributing  an  increasing  variety  of  products  to  the  world  economy.  Growth  rates  in  the  Asian 
NIC’s  will  likely  remain  substantially  higher  than  those  in  the  EEC  well  past  the  year  2000.  [70] 

Given  continued  development  of  international  information  transfer,  in  the  next  25  years  national 
economies  will  be  interconnected  and  mutually  dependent  to  an  unprecedented  degree,  whatever  their 
location  or  formal  alignment.  In  that  scenario,  geography  ceases  to  be  a  controlling  economic  variable 
because  the  conjunction  of  computers  and  telecommunications  systems  provides  instant  information 
access.  Industrial  processes,  much  less  dependent  than  previously  on  material  availability,  can  be  located 
where  labor  supply  and  retail  markets  are  most  favorable.  [14] 

Among  the  implications  of  such  a  scenario  is  the  internationalization  of  capital:  movement  of 
money  among  national  economies  less  influenced  by  individual  government  policy  than  by  the  interactions 
of  the  international  money  market  and  its  operatives.  This  means  that  traditional  control  of  a  national 
currency  may  not  be  available  to  nations,  including  the  United  States,  as  a  lever  of  international  power. 
Markets  will  no  longer  have  fixed  locations;  they  will  be  rather  communications  networks  with  access 
points  all  over  the  world.  An  example  is  the  spot  oil  market,  formerly  located  in  Rotterdam  but  now 
functioning  as  a  computer-linked  network  of  brokers  all  over  the  world.  Such  internationalization  leads 
to  a  certain  lack  of  national  or  international  legal  control  over  economic  activities  (such  as  establishment 
of  oil  prices),  which  has  deep  significance  for  the  economies  of  nation-states.  [14] 

Under  these  circumstances,  enterprises  formerly  located  exclusively  in  one  country  will  continue 
to  spread  their  operations  (and  their  investments)  to  other  countries,  forming  joint  ventures  or  other 
multinational  arrangements  because  of  the  following  advantages:  such  arrangements  offer  a  share  of 
foreign  markets,  they  divide  the  cost  of  research  and  production,  and  they  give  access  to  top-level  foreign 
technology.  An  example  is  the  proposed  joint  venture  of  Boeing  with  the  French  Aerospatiale  and 
German  Deutsche  Aerospace  firms  to  develop  a  new  supersonic  transport  plane  in  the  1990s--an 
arrangment  that  may  mean  transfer  of  sensitive  U.S.  technology.  On  another  level,  the  Singer  Company 
of  Connecticut  now  buys  sewing  machine  motors  from  Brazil  and  machine  shells  from  a  separate  U.S. 
supplier,  while  devoting  all  its  domestic  production  facilities  to  aerospace.  Under  this  arrangement,  its 
share  of  the  world  sewing  machine  market  increased  in  the  1980s.  [50]  Already  in  1991,  over  half  the 
goods  manufactured  in  the  United  States  contained  at  least  one  component  made  abroad,  and  half  of  U.S. 
trade  deals  occurred  between  U.S.  companies  and  their  foreign  branches  or  parent  companies.  [36] 

Driven  by  the  unprecedented  freedom  to  choose,  the  configurations  of  foreign  and  domestic 
enterprise  elements  are  likely  to  continue  multiplying  through  the  year  2000,  in  both  U.S.  and  foreign 
firms-in  inverse  proportion  to  national  barriers  placed  on  technology  exchange  and  trade.  This  context 
poses  new  aspects  to  the  long-lasting  U.S.  dilemma  captured  in  the  political  buzzword  "competitiveness." 


65 


In  recent  decades,  significant  parts  of  industries  such  as  electronics,  computers,  steel,  and  machine  tools, 
many  defense-vital,  have  lost  markets  to  foreign  competitors,  moved  operations  overseas,  or  been 
purchased  by  foreign  enterprises.  The  graphs  in  Figure  5  show  these  trends  in  selected  industries  over 
the  last  decade.  In  1991  the  private  Council  on  Competitiveness  found  that,  although  the  United  States 
retained  its  world  position  in  61  "technologies  rated  crucial  to  economic  prowess,"  its  loss  of  position 
in  33  others  was  cause  for  alarm  and  development  of  new  government  strategies  to  bolster  crucial 
industries.  [87] 

A  major  question,  already  touched  in  this  paper,  is  whether  such  reports  signal  actual  decline 
in  U.S.  economic  power,  or  whether  they  are  the  natural  outcome  of  unprecedented  diversification  and 
technological  change  in  the  world  economy.  The  disparity  of  answers  to  this  question  is  conditioned  by 
differences  in  philosophical  approaches  to  national  and  international  economics,  and  by  the  importance 
given  to  the  advances  of  competitors  who  have  approached  international  competition  differently  than  the 
United  States.  For  the  U.S.,  the  1990s  are  likely  to  be  a  period  of  intense  strategy  discussions  and 
adjustment.  By  2000  a  modified  approach  to  international  competition  and  globalization  will  likely 
emerge  and  prevail  through  the  early  decades  of  the  21st  century,  but  the  nature  of  that  approach  is  not 
yet  clear. 

In  spite  of  significant  domestic  political  backlash  against  Japanese  investment  and  trade  practices 
in  the  1980s,  the  U.S.  approach  to  the  "competitiveness  crisis"  (which  threatens  to  become  a  major 
political  issue)  has  been  to  support  free  trade,  discourage  protectionism  wherever  possible,  and,  in  the 
name  of  eventual  free  world  trade,  minimize  the  importance  of  the  aggressive  trade  strategies  of 
competitors.  An  example  is  the  plan  for  a  North  American  free-trade  pact  including  Canada  and  Mexico, 
widely  opposed  by  U.S.  labor  and  farm  groups  who  demand  protection  of  U.S.  jobs  from  cheap  Mexican 
labor.  Advocates  of  the  plan  foresee  expansion  into  new  markets  for  all  three  economies  as  a  first  step 
toward  total  economic  integration  of  the  Western  Hemisphere.  Such  a  plan  is  a  model  of  the  multilateral 
benefit  viewpoint  that  sees  globalization  as  requiring  that  at  least  part  of  U.S.  economic  policy  now  focus 
on  building  world  prosperity,  which  will  inevitably  reverberate  in  additional  revenues  for  all  those 
participating.  In  that  process,  some  short-term  sacrifice  of  U.S.  jobs  will  likely  be  necessary,  but  that 
is  seen  as  a  natural  component  of  the  free-market  system. 

Anti-protectionist,  free-trade  political  forces  seem  ready  to  dominate  the  national  U.S.  scene  at 
least  until  1996.  Meanwhile,  in  the  late  1980s  three  separate  national-level  competitiveness  councils  were 
formed,  each  evaluating  economic  evidence  from  a  different  standpoint.  One  of  them,  the  private 
Competitiveness  Council,  has  called  for  substantial  increases  in  government  direction  of  key  industries. 
For  the  competitiveness  situation  beyond  the  year  2000,  this  proliferation  of  advisory  groups  may  merely 
represent  the  deep  institutional  and  philosophical  divisions  that  block  consensus  on  a  problem  whose 
dimensions  have  not  been  assessed  yet;  or  they  may  show  an  emerging  national  perception  that 
competitiveness  is  ultimately  a  top-level  national  security  issue.  The  relative  influence  of  such  advisory 
panels  in  the  philosophical  shakedown  period  of  the  1990s  should  indicate  where  U.S.  competitiveness 
policy  will  be  in  2000  and  beyond.

Meanwhile,  in  The  Work  of  Nations  economist  Robert  Reich  extends  the  multilateral  benefit 
scenario,  predicting  the  end  of  national  economies  and  the  irrelevance  of  factors  such  as  national 
investment  sources  and  destinations,  location  of  production  facilities,  and  national  trade  balances.  In  this 
scenario,  the  health  of  the  U.S.  economy,  for  example,  no  longer  depends  on  that  of  the  U.S. 
corporation.  In  making  the  conventional  debate  over  economic  competitiveness  irrelevant,  however,  this 
view  assumes  (unrealistically?)  a  concurrent  withering  of  other  forms  of  geopolitical  competition  that 
might  interfere  with  cosmopolitian  harmony. 

Present  U.S.  economic  policy  also  encourages  free  domestic  enterprise,  in  opposition  to  various 
proposals  for  government  or  quasi-government  direction  of  industrial  policy.  The  rationale  of  the  present 
policy  is  that,  even  though  aggregate  performance  of  a  critical  industry  may  lag,  parts  of  that  industry 
likely  are  performing  well;  government  interference  or  control  will  discourage  initiative  and  competitive 
enthusiasm  in  those  parts.  [84]  Unlike  Reich’s  view,  this  policy  depends  on  the  continued  vitality  of 
conventional  national  economic  units  acting  independently.  Government’s  role  is  as  an  umpire,  to 
maintain  optimal  conditions  for  entrepreneurial  innovation. 

Critics  of  a  domestic  free-enterprise  approach  point  to  the  Japanese  and  European  examples  of 
cooperation  between  state  agencies  and  private  enterprise,  as  streamlining  investment  targeting  and 
promoting  consistency  in  long-term  commitment  to  technological  processes.  Savings  rates,  R&D,  and 
human  resources  development  are  said  to  be  among  the  beneficiaries  of  such  a  policy.  According  to  this 
view,  before  the  year  2000  competition  with  countries  thus  equipped  will  become  increasingly  difficult 
for  totally  independent  U.S.  companies  in  the  most  desirable  markets.  [51;16] 

If  the  United  States  should  reach  2000  in  an  obviously  deteriorating  international  position  because 
of  continued  low  productivity,  high  budget  deficits,  an  outmoded  infrastructure,  or  some  combination  of 
those  elements,  two  patterns  of  action  may  emerge.  As  already  mentioned,  protectionism  will  be  pushed 
(by  organized  labor  and  other  influential  factions)  as  a  weapon  against  aggressive  trade  practices  by 
foreigners.  Pressure  will  be  especially  strong  if  a  limited  world  market  tends  toward  the  zero-sum  model 
(unchanging  amounts  of  available  goods  divided  in  varying  portions  among  world  economies)  instead  of 
the  scenario  of  multilateral  benefit  from  an  ever-expanding  world  economy.  The  "deflationary"  scenario 
would  mean  abandonment  of  productivity  growth  as  a  goal,  reduced  capital  investment,  and  emphasis  on 
preserving  traditional  industries  and  jobs.  On  a  world  scale,  it  would  also  re-emphasize  national  economic 
units,  as  nations  ended  cooperative  policies  to  secure  their  share  of  limited  markets. 

Targeted  economic  policy,  which  has  been  proposed  for  the  United  States  in  many  variations  of 
private  and  governmental  control  mechanisms,  would  establish  a  consensual  regulation  system  that  would 
move  the  U.S.  economy  toward  a  partnership  among  government,  business,  and  labor  that  was  closer  to 
that  in  Japan  and  Germany  and  reshape  the  conventional  adversarial  relationship  of  those  three  institutions 
that  now  permits  only  limited  "watchdog"  government  regulation.  [41] 

The  latter  policy  runs  counter  to  cultural  values  of  individualism  and  competitive  spirit  strongly 
ingrained  in  U.S.  society  and  prevailing  political  opinion  against  government  interference  in  the  economy. 
Barring  a  major  political  shift,  there  is  little  prospect  that  policy  targeting  will  be  applied  broadly  before 


68 


2015.  If  a  major  shift  away  from  current  laissez-faire  policy  (domestic  and/or  international)  is  required 
in  the  year  2000,  public  perception  of  the  U.S.  position  and  the  threat  of  international  competition  (will 
J apan  still  be  an  easily  identifiable  villain,  or  will  competition  be  distributed  more  subtly  among  the  EEC 
and  several  Asian  countries?)  will  be  an  important  driver  of  policy  choice  between  the  years  2000  and 
2015. 

The  impact  on  the  Army  of  various  scenarios  of  future  world  economic  cooperation  and  rivalry 
is  discussed  in  "Geopolitics."  An  influential  aspect  of  a  new  U.S.  position  in  the  "global  economy"  is 
the  increased  mobility  of  defense-vital  enterprises  among  two  or  more  countries,  when  the  sale  or 
relocation  of  R&D  or  production  facilities  elsewhere  becomes  economically  attractive.  The  threat  to 
military  procurement  of  the  resulting  redistribution  may  depend  on  the  degree  of  concentration  of  such 
activities  among  foreign  enterprises  because  concentration  reduces  supply  alternatives.  To  meet  this 
threat,  the  "4/50  rule"  has  been  used  in  evaluating  purchase  of  national -security-vital  enterprises  or 
facilities  by  foreign  buyers:  if  over  half  such  an  industry  would  thus  come  under  control  of  four  or  fewer 
foreign  enterprises,  a  purchase  may  be  blocked  under  this  formula.  Control  of  such  moves,  however, 
is  problematic  given  the  complex  of  regulations  and  policies  that  now  govern  commercial  transactions 
with  foreign  enterprises.  The  Committee  on  Foreign  Investment  in  the  U.S.  (CFIUS)  was  founded  in 
1988  to  determine  the  national  security  ramifications  of  certain  industries  coming  under  foreign  control. 
Because  the  definition  of  "national  security"  has  been  vague,  this  organization  has  not  had  administrative 
"teeth."  [36]  This  factor  combines  with  poor  domestic  investment  and  tax  incentives  and  inappropriate 
technology  export  laws  to  drive  some  defense-critical  enterprises  abroad.  A  result  of  that  combination 
of  circumstances  was  seen  in  the  Persian  Gulf  War,  where  the  U.S.  military  was  totally  dependent  on 
French  and  Japanese  firms  for  certain  vital  spare  parts.  [14]  Continuation  of  domestic  and  external 
laissez-faire  policy  well  into  the  1990s,  given  continued  aggressive  economic  policy  by  international 
competitors,  would  seem  to  promise  more  such  incidents. 

Under  even  the  most  positive  scenario,  the  defense  industry  will  likely  face  purchase  of  critical 
materials  and  equipment  from  non-U. S.  sources  between  2000  and  2015,  for  two  reasons:  a  strong 
commitment  to  a  wide  variety  of  advanced  technology  in  military  hardware,  whatever  the  force  size;  and 
the  momentum  of  economic  globalization,  which  will  continue  to  move  critical  producers  of  at  least  some 
of  that  advanced  technology  irretrievably  beyond  U.S.  control,  no  matter  how  strong  the  domestic 
economy. 

A  U.S.  protectionist  policy  after  the  year  2000  would  likely  constrict  the  range  of  military 
procurement,  especially  given  the  likelihood  of  increased  U.S.  reliance  on  technology  to  offset  manpower 
loss  in  the  1990s.  A  response  to  this  would  be  increased  government  sponsorship  of  targeted  R&D 
programs  and/or  production  facilities,  incorporating  civilian  industry  and  academic  research  centers  into 
mixed  defense  enterprises  whose  political  justification  would  be  impending  crisis  in  national  security. 
Such  a  crisis  might  be  very  real  if  a  re-emphasis  on  self-sufficiency  brought  higher  cost,  lower 
production,  and  delayed  deployment  of  defense  systems-dangers  inherent  in  shrinking  the  production 
base.  [36] 


69 


An  alternative  scenario  would  be  comprehensive  analysis  during  the  1990s  of  presently  disparate 
elements  of  tax  law,  procurement  rules,  R&D  policy,  and  technology  transfer  policy  in  the  context  of  the 
present  and  future  global  market.  By  the  year  2000  such  an  analysis  might  begin  producing  an  up-to- 
date,  focused  national  policy  that  would  insulate  military  procurement  from  the  most  insecure  elements 
of  foreign  supply  and  stabilize  its  R&D  base.  The  former  might  be  done  by  ensuring  that  foreign 
suppliers  are  as  widely  dispersed  and  competitive  as  possible,  the  latter  by  supplementing  private 
investment  in  the  high-risk  stages  of  cutting-edge  technology  development.  [36]  But  the  most  likely  short¬ 
term  driver  of  such  a  development  is  a  military  emergency  in  which,  unlike  the  Persian  War  experience, 
foreign  supply  of  equipment  is  not  forthcoming. 

Perhaps  the  most  likely  scenario  is  a  part-way  U.S.  commitment  to  targeted  investment  in  R&D, 
capital  equipment,  and  training  programs,  on  a  "special  need"  basis,  by  2000.  Using  the  precedent  of 
the  space  program,  such  an  approach  could  be  politically  feasible  because  it  would  not  visibly  foresake 
the  free  market  philosophy.  It  would  likely  seek  to  bolster  U.S.  competitiveness  in  defense-vital 
industries  such  as  semiconductors,  electronics,  and  machine  tools.  Using  a  narrow  definition  of  national 
security,  this  approach  might  be  a  "fix"  that  would  support  U.S.  military  suppliers  past  the  year  2000. 
But  it  might  well  fail  to  address  broader  issues  such  as  low  savings  and  high  consumption  rates,  which 
ultimately  shrink  the  amount  of  investment  funds  (public  or  private)  available  for  either  targeted  or 
general  use.  And  the  implicit  protectionism  of  such  targeted  support  may  increase  military  procurement 
prices  in  the  same  way  that  automobile  import  quotas  increase  car  prices. 


THE  MILITARY  AND  CIVILIAN  ECONOMIES 

A  frequent  near-term  prediction  is  that  in  the  1990s  the  military  will  reduce  its  personnel  and 
extend  its  reliance  on  advanced  technologies  such  as  semiconductors,  advanced  communications  and 
software.  But,  given  the  acknowledged  prospect  of  a  shrinking  military  budget,  the  economics  of 
procurement  of  such  technologies,  as  well  as  weapons  systems  and  other  equipment,  will  receive  close 
attention  in  the  1990s;  by  2000  a  process  of  drastic  revision  may  be  well  underway. 

By  1991  defense  production  was  virtually  disconnected  from  the  civilian  economy.  Although 
military  projects  have  an  impressive  record  of  spinoff  contributions  to  civilian  technology  (such  as 
satellite  communications),  little  technology  now  flows  out  of  the  labs  of  military  contractors  into  the 
civilian  sector,  and  military  production  is  increasingly  incompatible  with  technologies  and  production 
methods  in  analogous  civilian  operations.  [13]  Although  the  military  share  of  federal  R&D  spending 
remains  steady  at  67  percent,  the  part  of  that  devoted  to  basic  research,  the  area  most  likely  to  have 
civilian  application,  has  dropped  from  6  percent  to  2  percent  [20],  and  at  the  same  time  industry-funded 
R&D  has  decreased  (see  Fig.  6).  Instead  of  spinning  off  advanced  technology,  military  production  is  now 
a  net  recipient  of  technology.  [45] 

Military  specifications  have  become  very  precise  and  unique,  performance  requirements  tend  to 


70 


override  cost  and  durability  factors,  and  the  bureaucracy  of  paperwork  and  regulations  surrounding 
military  procurement  has  become  overwhelming.  Congressional  oversight  limits  sector  overlap  in  the 
name  of  military  cost  control,  and  the  military  insists  on  the  right  to  transfer  technology  to  contractors’ 
competitors  if  national  security  requires  it.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  U.S.  producers  of  military 
equipment  have  been  pared  to  a  unique  group  of  companies  equipped  to  deal  with  such  requirements. 
According  to  the  Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies,  68  percent  of  firms  providing  military 
goods  in  1982  were  no  longer  doing  so  in  1987,  despite  significant  increases  in  the  defense  budget  during 
that  period.  [13]  Most  firms  that  have  both  civilian  and  military  production  operations  have  carefully 
separated  the  two. 

Many  have  proposed  breaking  down  the  barrier  between  military  and  civilian  production  in  some 
way  in  order  to  allow  the  military  to  take  advantage  of  dual-use  and  cost-saving  technology  and  the  many 
R&D  areas  in  which  civilian  production  moved  ahead  in  the  1980s,  and  also  to  allow  civilian  industry 
to  profit  more  from  the  67  percent  of  federal  research  funds  going  to  the  military.  The  urgency  of 
reorganization  is  reinforced  by  numerous  examples  of  production  inefficiency,  cost  overruns,  and  lack 
of  backup  production  capacity  in  the  military  as  well  as  by  a  perceived  lag  in  civilian  R&D  compared  to 
foreign  competitors. 

Among  suggested  innovations  in  the  military  economy  are  adopting  the  design-to-cost  approach 
of  the  civilian  sector,  in  which  product  performance  is  maximized  only  to  the  point  the  market  will  bear 
its  cost  instead  of  driving  up  cost  dramatically  by  insisting  on  the  absolute  maximum  performance; 
continuing  competition  among  contractors  throughout  production  of  an  item,  forcing  them  to  compete  for 
annual  sales  shares  rather  than  incurring  uncontrollable  production  cost  increases;  changing  specifications 
to  minimize  component  specialization  and  allow  use  of  off-the-shelf  commercial  parts  that  have  already 
been  market-tested  for  both  performance  and  cost;  and  finding  uses  for  production  capacity  idled  after 
completion  of  specialized  military  projects. 

Substantial  institutional  drivers  would  resist  such  reforms,  in  spite  of  the  foreseeable  likelihood 
of  spiraling  procurement  costs.  First,  restructuring  the  relationship  of  civilian  and  military  industry 
would  require  a  federal  coordinating  body  with  a  long-term  mandate  and  close  connections  with  industry-- 
a  bureaucratic  entity  sure  to  be  attacked  on  the  same  grounds  as  was  a  comprehensive  national  investment 
policy,  as  government  interference  in  the  free  market.  Second,  forced  diversification  and  competition 
for  defense  contracts  would  be  opposed  by  the  powerful  companies  remaining  as  defense  suppliers,  who 
are  already  lobbying  hard  to  retain  contracts  in  a  budget  crunch.  [67]  And  third,  there  is  now  an 
ingrained  assumption  in  government  and  the  military,  codified  in  a  mountain  of  defense  regulations  and 
directives,  that  unique  military  specifications  are  the  norm  rather  than  the  exception  in  guiding  defense 
production.  [37]  In  even  the  most  positive  scenario,  to  dissolve  such  institutional  obstacles  would 
require  an  integration  strategy  lasting  through  the  1990s.  This  fact  means  that  the  effect  of  any  such 
strategy  begun  in  the  next  few  years  would  be  first  seen  in  the  defense  systems  initiated  between  the  years 
2000  and  2015.

In  the  1990s,  the  cost  driver  may  well  overcome  institutional  obstacles  if  the  design, 
development,  and  manufacture  of  weapons  systems  is  as  cost-inefficient  as  most  critics  claim.  Another 
potential  driver  is  a  shift  toward  standing  U.S.  forces  with  lighter  equipment,  emphasizing 
communications  and  light  vehicles.  That  development  would  broaden  procurement  potential  of  off-the- 
shelf  equipment,  but  it  would  also  require  greater  civilian  capability  to  shift  to  production  of  weapons 
systems  in  the  event  of  a  major  conflict— something  the  civilian  economy  cannot  do  at  present.  [45] 

Were  a  substantial  degree  of  civilian  and  military  industrial  reintegration  to  be  achieved  by  2000, 
a  more  flexible  approach  to  procurement  would  be  possible  after  2000.  Instead  of  the  current  "pipeline," 
leading  straight  from  R&D  to  the  fielding  of  a  specific  system,  emphasis  could  fall  on  evolution  of 
existing  systems  as  required  by  geopolitical  and  budgetary  conditions.  Such  emphasis  would  be  possible 
because  the  methodology  of  the  defense  economy  would  resemble  more  closely  civilian  enterprises  in 
design  approaches,  procurement  practices,  and  cost  sensitivity-making  the  military  market  a  reasonable 
area  of  expansion  for  civilian  enterprise  and  giving  the  military  a  wide  range  of  ready,  cost-effective 
alternatives.  Reintegration  would  be  especially  useful  given  a  scenario  of  proliferating  small  enterprises 
capable  of  producing  customized  high-tech  items.  Such  a  constructive  relationship  likely  would  be  less 
possible,  however,  if  reintegration  were  achieved  because  government  agencies  pressured  parts  of  the 
civilian  sector  to  adapt  to  the  unique  requirements  of  military  production.  [37] 


UNRESOLVED  ISSUES 

The  U.S.  economic  situation  will  be  influenced  by  a  number  of  factors,  internal  and  external  to 
it,  whose  resolution  are  unknown  and  unknowable  at  this  time.  Among  them  are  the  degree  of  constraint 
to  be  exercised  by  environmental  legislation  on  production,  and  the  impact  of  environmental  change  on 
U.S.  production  centers;  the  role  of  independent  economic  policy  making  by  economic  organizations  at 
the  state  level;  the  capability  of  the  U.S.  government  to  make  major  changes  in  current  attitudes  to 
economic  planning,  if  necessary;  future  U.S.  public  attitudes  toward  the  "competitiveness  issue," 
consumption,  and  women  in  the  workplace;  geopolitical  conditions  requiring  varying  degrees  of  economic 
support  for  the  military;  and  the  degree  of  U.S.  cultural  adaptation  to  globalization. 

In  1990  U.S.  statutes  such  as  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  Clean  Air  Act  contained  provisions  for 
more  stringent  controls  on  industrial  pollution,  requiring  installation  of  expensive  purification  equipment 
in  plants.  The  Clean  Air  Act  targeted  small  polluters  such  as  gas  stations  and  dry  cleaners  for  the  first 
time  in  1990.  In  the  1990s,  public  concern  about  acid  rain  and  the  increasing  likelihood  of  global 
warming  will  likely  increase,  in  opposition  to  the  accepted  societal  value  of  unimpeded  economic  growth. 
Beyond  that,  however,  the  actual  long-term  effects  of  those  phenomena  and  other  types  of  persistent 
environmental  degradation  may  be  felt  much  more  sharply  after  the  year  2000-especially  if  for  some 
reason  strong  international  measures  are  not  taken  in  the  interim.  In  that  scenario,  before  2015  U.S. 
coastal  population  and  economic  centers  and  agricultural  patterns  might  feel  major  climatic  impact,  and 


73 


pollution  might  become  a  divisive  issue  among  bordering  countries  such  as  Canada  and  the  United  States 
and  the  U.S.  and  Mexico.  The  timeliness  and  appropriateness  of  environmental  measures  in  the  1990s 
will  determine  the  severity  of  such  disturbances  in  the  forecast  period  and  beyond. 

Given  strict  enforcement  (not  the  norm  before  1990  but  seemingly  more  likely  through  2000), 
U.S.  industry  would  invest  billions  of  dollars  to  meet  requirements,  diverting  funds  from  major 
infrastructure  improvement.  The  other  side  of  the  environment  question  is  that  valuable  new  technology 
and  processes,  some  perhaps  with  military  application,  result  from  the  drive  for  clean  air  and  water.  The 
extent  of  the  positive  and  negative  sides  of  the  environmental  factor  will  depend  on  the  perceived  margin 
available  in  the  economy  for  upping  environmental  standards,  in  combination  with  public  attitudes.  In 
a  prolonged  downturn,  both  government  enforcement  and  technological  innovation  would  presumably 
slow.  An  aspect  of  the  environmental  question  especially  important  to  the  U.S.  economy  is  the 
technology  of  waste  material  disposal.  In  the  age  of  independence  from  material  requirements  for 
manufacturing,  this  largely  unresolved  problem  is  one  of  the  two  remaining  obstacles  (the  other  being 
dependence  on  conventional  fuels).  New  solutions  in  waste  disposal  would  remove  a  major  constraint 
on  industrial  location  and  streamline  production  processes,  while  the  lack  of  such  solutions  would  detract 
from  the  overall  technological  upgrading  expected  in  the  next  25  years. 

In  spite  of  a  consistent  U.S.  position  against  government  participation  and  interference  in  private 
enterprise,  many  states  have  formed  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  and  begun  to  solve  locally  many 
of  the  national  problems  listed  above.  For  example,  the  Ben  Franklin  Partnership  of  Pennsylvania,  run 
by  the  legislature  and  representatives  from  labor,  education,  and  business,  uses  state  and  private  funds 
to  stimulate  development  and  marketing  of  technology.  And  the  Corporation  for  Indiana’s  International 
Future,  under  a  similarly  diverse  administration,  identifies  and  promotes  state  industries  with  foreign 
export  potential -one  of  several  state  organizations  now  making  direct  export  deals  with  foreign  countries. 
Now  operating  on  a  relatively  small  scale,  such  agencies  may  have  significant  impact  on  the  national 
economy  in  the  next  25  years,  and  their  success  could  stimulate  revision  of  national  policy.  [44] 

A  related  question  is  whether  the  U.S.  government  is  fundamentally  able  to  run  a  comprehensive 
national  "industrial  policy."  Several  observers  have  noted  that  an  industrial  policy  already  exists  in  the 
hodgepodge  of  regulations,  taxes,  and  subsidies  enforced  by  various  agencies.  The  tobacco  industry,  for 
example,  is  simultaneously  taxed,  restricted,  and  subsidized.  Given  the  diversity  and  traditional 
independence  of  U.S.  business  enterprise,  even  targeted  policy-making  control  may  be  infeasible.  In  spite 
of  frequent  calls  for  government  activism  in  the  "competitiveness  crisis,"  a  workable  organizational  form 
of  such  activism  remains  problematic. 

Another  imponderable  are  changes  in  U.S.  political  and  societal  attitudes  on  economic  issues: 
what  importance  will  the  public  assign  to  international  competitiveness  in  the  election  of  2000?  How  will 
that  evaluation  affect  support  for  the  aforementioned  increase  in  government  control  of  private  enterprise? 
Will  there  be  a  full-scale  social  backlash  against  the  idea  of  working  mothers  and  the  consumption 
patterns  of  the  1980s,  and  will  it  be  followed  in  the  next  decade  by  an  opposite  reaction?  The  public 
attitude  to  competitiveness  will  depend  partly  on  actual  economic  conditions  in  2000  (Will  the  standard 


74 


of  living  have  dropped  appreciably  by  then?),  partly  on  the  arcane  process  of  issue  identification  by 
politicians.  Then,  if  competitiveness  becomes  a  major  issue,  will  the  public  accept  quick-fix  solutions 
(such  as  trade  barriers)  or  demand  fundamental  changes  in  education  and  industrial  infrastructure? 
Public  attitudes  toward  certain  social  issues  will  affect  the  work  force  and  the  orientation  of  U.S. 
manufacturing.  Although  women  made  a  major  contribution  to  work  force  expansion  in  the  1980s  for 
both  economic  and  sociological  reasons,  re-emphasis  of  family  values  might  cause  many  to  re-evaluate 
career  decisions  in  the  next  25  years,  with  possible  serious  impact  on  management  and  the  skilled  labor 
force. 

In  another  area,  the  shape  of  consumer  production  in  many  categories  will  likely  be  altered  by 
a  combination  of  increased  environmental  consciousness  and  a  related  backlash  against  previous 
consumption  levels-but  the  impact  of  both  those  factors  has  wavered  in  recent  times.  Judging  by  trends 
in  the  last  15  years,  the  period  2000-2015  will  likely  see  at  least  one  major  swing  in  public  attitudes  on 
women’s  and  environmental  issues  and  on  consumption  levels,  but  the  starting  and  end  points  of  such  a 
swing  are  unknown. 

Geopolitical  issues  and  conditions  will  continue  to  influence  strongly  U.S.  economic  policy.  A 
major  factor  here  will  be  the  degree  of  U.S.  energy  dependence  on  the  Middle  East  (see  "Resource 
Picture").  Whatever  political  alignments  exist  there  between  2000  and  2015,  continued  dependence  on 
imported  fuel  would  be  a  major  economic  weakness  in  that  period  and  could  lead  to  additional  expensive 
conflicts  in  the  region. 

Another  unanswered  question  in  this  area  is  the  geopolitical  fallout  of  the  new  international 
economic  blocs  that  will  likely  form  in  the  1990s  among  industrialized  nations.  Even  if  those  blocs 
provide  economic  growth  for  all  their  members,  substantial  parts  of  the  traditional  Third  World,  and  even 
perhaps  parts  of  Eastern  Europe,  will  likely  remain  outside  direct  range  of  such  benefits.  Supporting 
them  economically,  or  even  combatting  armed  uprisings  by  them,  would  reduce  substantially  the  health 
of  any  new  world  economy.  And  a  scenario  of  intermittent  failure  or  conflict  within  the  new  economic 
blocs  would  worsen  the  prospects  of  dealing  with  the  "have-not"  nations. 

Finally,  reaping  the  benefits  of  globalizing  the  U.S.  economy  across  a  broad  spectrum  will 
likely  require  substantial  cultural  accommodation  and  some  compromise  of  the  U.S.  values  of  economic 
independence  and  entrepreneurial  freedom.  Items  such  as  learning  foreign  languages  and  adopting  foreign 
customs  will  become  much  more  important.  Ultimately  the  U.S.  education  system  will  determine  how 
those  values  change,  but  change  is  needed  in  the  generation  now  making  economic  policy  as  well. 
Understanding  of  competing  national  approaches  to  economics,  if  not  compromise  with  them  in  U.S. 
policy  making,  will  be  necessary  for  the  United  States  to  be  a  full  partner  in  the  globalized  economy. 
An  especially  constructive  starting  point  would  be  Japan,  toward  which  U.S.  attitudes  of  fear  and  hostility 
have  been  formed  without  complete  understanding  of  that  alien  culture.  But  the  culture  shock  of  no 
longer  being  able  to  "go  it  alone,"  absorbed  only  slowly  to  this  point,  may  linger  past  the  year  2000.

CONCLUSION 


Whatever  trends  emerge  and  whatever  drivers  prove  most  influential,  in  the  year  2000  the  U.S. 
economy  will  have  undergone  a  decade  of  intensive,  often  painful  readjustment.  Most  parts  of  the 
economy,  including  the  military,  will  share  in  that  process.  Both  the  goods-producing  and  service  sectors 
will  have  substantially  more  automation  in  2000,  but  the  nature  of  the  automation  process  in  the  forecast 
period  will  depend  on  several  variables:  whether  a  point  of  minimum  human  participation  has  been 
reached,  where  further  automation  is  not  cost  effective;  how  much  investment  capital  has  been  available 
in  the  1990s  for  retooling;  new  government  approaches  to  investment  that  might  speed  (or  deter)  the 
retooling  process  in  the  forecast  period;  the  number  of  skilled  positions  required  in  new  automated 
workplaces,  compared  with  the  supply  of  skilled  labor  after  2000;  and  the  influences  of  foreign 
competition:  the  stimulus  to  match  foreign  advancements  and  the  impact  of  losing  goods-producing  jobs 
overseas. 

Structural  changes  will  continue  in  the  work  force,  management,  enterprise  configuration,  and 
the  balance  between  services  and  goods-producing  enterprises.  In  the  work  force,  these  changes  will  be 
influenced  by  demographic  factors  such  as  age-cohort  distribution,  quantitative  and  qualitative  changes 
in  the  female  work  force,  and  immigration  patterns;  stimuli  and  disincentives  for  higher  education; 
changing  lifestyles  for  older  workers;  availability  of  business-  or  government-supported  apprenticeship 
programs;  and  the  relative  distribution  of  jobs  over  a  period  of  time  between  skilled  and  unskilled 
positions.  In  management,  important  change  drivers  will  be  the  speed  at  which  automated  information 
systems  make  traditional  mid-level  positions  redundant  and  physically  disperse  enterprises;  degree  of 
resistance  to  concepts  such  as  flexible  labor-management  teams  and  multiple-skill  management;  the  fate 
of  the  small,  independent  entrepreneur/manager  after  2000;  and  the  cumulative  impact  of  repeated 
instances  of  white-collar  displacement  in  economic  downturns  before  and  after  2000. 

In  the  balance  of  goods-production  and  services,  important  factors  are  the  speed  and  resource 
availability  of  capital  equipment  replacement,  which  will  help  determine  the  sector’s  contribution  to  GNP 
in  the  forecast  period;  political  decisions  on  protecting  some  industries  from  international  competition  and 
subsidizing  R&D  and  capital  investment  in  security-vital  industries;  the  impact  of  free-trade  agreements 
on  job  losses  in  manufacturing  to  foreign  competitors,  and  the  degree  to  which  U.S.  goods  producers  go 
multinational;  new  social  and  consumption  patterns  (e.g.  greater  consciousness  of  environmental  impacts 
of  consumption,  greater  use  of  public  transportation)  that  redistribute  demand  between  and  within  sectors; 
and  the  degree  to  which  services  such  as  information  supply  are  integrated  into  a  new,  complex  version 
of  conventional  goods-producing  activity,  making  the  distinction  between  the  sectors  irrelevant. 

The  movement  of  enterprise  configuration  away  from  conventional  central  locations  toward  the 
multiple  locations  of  consumers  is  likely  to  be  influenced  in  degree  and  speed  rather  than  direction  in  the 
forecast  period.  Drivers  are  the  speed  at  which  goods  producers  are  weaned  from  dependance  on 
conventional  fuel  and  waste  disposal  requirements;  further  dispersal  of  population  centers,  especially  in 
the  West  and  Sun  Belt;  possible  environmental  or  resource  constraints  on  conventional  transport  means;

and  consumer  choices  between  standardization  and  customization. 

The  adjustment  of  the  1990s  is  likely  to  have  been  especially  problematic  in  determination  of  the 
U.S.  role  in  the  global  economy.  That  adjustment  should  include  major  policy  choices  that  would  then 
play  out  through  the  forecast  period.  If  policy  makers  continue  to  assume  that  the  U.S.  economy  is 
fundamentally  strong  and  that  sharing  trade  and  industry  on  an  equal  basis  with  foreign  competitors  will 
ultimately  benefit  all  participants  in  an  expanded  world  economy,  policy  may  not  have  changed  greatly 
by  2000.  If  it  has  not,  scenarios  for  the  forecast  period  would  range  from  benign  integration  of  the  U.S. 
economy  (including  parts  now  labeled  vital  for  national  security)  into  an  expanding  world  market  divided 
into  several  major  trading  blocs,  to  exclusion  of  U.S.  products  from  a  world  market  unable  to  sustain  the 
growth  of  its  least  competitive  participants.  The  latter  scenario  would  mean  extended  U.S.  dependance 
on  foreign  suppliers  for  high-level  (including  military)  products. 

If,  however,  the  issue  of  U.S.  competitiveness  gains  political  resonance  in  the  1990s  adjustment 
period  (whether  or  not  actual  U.S.  economic  competitiveness  deteriorates),  U.S.  policy  may  abandon  the 
optimistic  view  of  free  world  trade  by  adopting  trade  barriers,  restricting  technology  transfer  and 
involvement  of  foreign  firms  in  U.S.  R&D  and  production  operations,  and/or  targeting  government 
support  to  critical  industries.  Selection  drivers  will  be  the  nature  and  source  of  domestic  political 
pressure,  trade  and  investment  practices  by  foreign  competitors,  and  the  degree  to  which  U.S.  economic 
indicators  have  rebounded  by  the  beginning  of  the  forecast  period.  Infrastructure  changes  (revamped 
educational /training  programs,  stronger  investment  incentives,  permanent  govemment/business  steering 
committees)  may  also  result. 

The  relation  of  the  military  and  civilian  economies  will  also  have  been  rigorously  tested  by  the 
year  2000.  If  the  present  separation  of  the  two  stands,  military  procurement  will  likely  be  much  more 
expensive  and  military  equipment  more  specialized.  Drivers  of  this  scenario  are  a  long-term  geopolitical 
situation  allowing  drastic  reduction  in  volume  and  applicability  of  military  equipment,  combined  with 
continued  institutional  resistance  to  reintegration  of  civilian  and  military  production.  On  the  other  hand, 
reintegration  would  be  triggered  by  procurement  cost  increases  continuing  through  2000,  combined  with 
geopolitical  uncertainties  continuing  to  require  readiness  and  flexibility  by  U.S.  forces--both  factors  strong 
enough  to  overwhelm  institutional  resistance.  Even  given  the  immediate  onset  of  reintegration,  however, 
results  would  only  be  visible  starting  in  2000,  meaning  that  the  forecast  period  would  be  a  shakedown 
time  for  the  new  system. 

Another  major  driver  in  this  issue  is  U.S.  budget  commitments  to  the  military.  This  in  turn  will 
continue  to  be  influenced  by  public  perceptions  of  threat  and  performance  (the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall 
reduced  threat  perception;  Operation  Desert  Storm  improved  performance  perception,  hence  willingness 
to  spend)  and  by  management  of  whatever  national  deficit  exists  in  the  forecast  period.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 
UNITED  STATES  RESOURCES 


—  The  United  States  is  in  a  position  of  strength  in  terms  of  food,  water,  medicine  and  associated- 
industry  resources  (for  example,  timber  and  fertilizer).  There  are  adequate  or  friendly  foreign  supplies 
available. 

-  The  United  States  is  in  a  position  of  weakness  in  terms  of  energy  resources,  particularly  oil. 
The  forecast  is  for  continuing  reliance  on  fossil  fuels  for  energy  and  dependence  on  imports  for  supplies. 
Fusion  energy  will  not  be  operational  before  the  year  2040.  Safeguarding  the  next  century’s  de  facto 
strategic  petroleum  reserve,  the  Persian  Gulf,  is  likely  to  require  a  U.S.  military  presence. 

—  The  United  States  will  face  persistent  dependence  on  foreign  supplies  for  many  strategic  and 
critical  materials,  often  concentrated  in  politically  and  socially  unstable  areas  (the  southern  "High  Africa" 
region  and  the  Soviet  Union).  The  United  States  will  continue  to  stockpile  these  minerals  and  materials 
as  insurance  against  supply  cut-offs. 

—  The  traditional  patterns  of  resource  exploitation,  acquisition,  and  use  will  cause  increasing 
concern  for  environmental  consequences  and  changes  will  occur  because  of  public  awareness.  These 
changes  will  foster  new  technologies  and  developments. 

—  The  United  States  Army  will  be  engaged  in  environmental  missions  and  conservation  activities 
at  home  and  abroad  in  the  future.

THE  UNITED  STATES  RESOURCE  PICTURE  IN  2015 


INTRODUCTION 

No  country  has  a  greater  vested  interest  in  domestic  and  global  availability,  production  and 
distribution  of  resources  than  the  United  States.  With  about  5  percent  of  the  world’s  population  and  7 
percent  of  its  land  area,  the  United  States  consumes  about  25  percent  of  the  world’s  energy  and  finished 
products,  and  13  percent  of  its  raw  nonfuel  mineral  production.  Casual  indifference  to  changes  in  the 
location,  availability,  production  and  distribution  of  vital  resources  puts  U.S.  welfare  and  security  at 
considerable  risk.  Viewed  in  terms  of  domestic  and  world  resource  production  and  consumption,  trends 
in  some  critical  categories,  mineral  fuels  and  some  metallic  minerals,  for  example,  have  been  unfavorable 
for  years  and  a  cause  for  serious  concern. 

Although  it  is  still  a  country  more  generously  endowed  with  natural  wealth  than  most,  the  United 
States  since  the  end  of  World  War  II  has  embarked  upon  a  path  of  development  that  has  been 
transforming  it  into  an  increasingly  raw  materials  deficit  country.  By  the  1970’s  the  United  States  was 
consistently  consuming  more  minerals  than  it  produced.  In  1988  the  trade  deficit  in  nonfuel  minerals  and 
metals  amounted  to  $22.3  billion,  about  19  percent  of  the  total  trade  deficit.  Adding  in  charges  for 
energy  imports,  in  1988  the  bill  for  imported  resources  alone  was  $64.1  billion  or  54  percent  of  the  total 
trade  deficit.  Meanwhile,  the  United  States  has  drawn  down  its  own  geologic  capital  by  depleting  reserves 
of  some  critical  and  strategic  materials. 

Equally  disconcerting  from  a  security  standpoint  has  been  a  trend  driving  some  crucial  industries 
(steel  or,  lately,  semiconductor  industries)  for  which  U.S.  raw  material  stocks  are  adequate  to  move  a 
portion  of  production  abroad  or  abandon  the  United  States  altogether.  Iron  ore  reserves  in  the  United 
States  are  adequate  for  hundreds  of  years  of  supply.  Yet  U.S.  industry  finds  it  increasingly  difficult  to 
produce  steel  at  a  competitive  price,  and  manufacturing  thus  depends  more  and  more  upon  Asian 
countries  or  Brazil  for  the  enormous  quantities  of  steel  needed  to  build  aircraft,  automobiles,  and  other 
consumer  durables. 

Three  of  the  most  critical  materials  of  an  industrial  society  and  its  armed  forces  are:  steel, 
aluminum,  and  refined  petroleum;  these  materials  will  remain  critical  throughout  the  forecast  period.  In 
1950  the  United  States  produced  47  percent  of  the  world’s  steel,  44  percent  of  the  world’s  aluminum, 
and  52  percent  of  the  world’s  refined  petroleum  [15].  In  1990,  the  shares  had  declined  to  10  percent, 
21  percent  and  15  percent,  respectively.  If  current  trends  continue,  by  2015,  the  United  States  will 
account  for  just  4  percent,  9  percent,  and  7  percent  of  these  commodities  so  essential  to  U.S.  economic 
prosperity  and  defense  (see  Fig.  1). 

National  and  international  security  implications  of  import  reliance  for  critical  resources  are  far- 
reaching  and  profound.  The  recent  war  in  the  Persian  Gulf  illustrated  U.S.  resolve  to  sacrifice  national 
treasure  and  American  lives  to  protect  one  of  the  key  sources  of  U.S.  and  Western  prosperity.  Petroleum 
and  petroleum-derived  products  are  indispensable  to  sustaining  and  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  and 


85 


economic  vitality  of  the  United  States  and  the  developed  world.  In  the  forecast  period,  the  assessment 
is  that  these  products  will  continue  to  be  the  energy  mainstay  of  the  United  States  and  the  major  Federal 
consumer,  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces. 

Unfortunately,  most  estimates  of  domestic  supply  project  significant  declines  in  U.S.  crude  oil 
production,  with  concomitant  reliance  on  foreign,  primarily  OPEC,  oil  stocks.  Import  reliance  for  natural 
gas  is  slated  to  double  from  10  percent  in  1989  to  20  percent  in  2015.  Between  1990  and  2015,  coal  will 
be  the  only  exporting  sector  of  the  nation’s  import-dependent  energy  industry.  As  an  intense  user  of 
transportation  and  hardware,  the  U.S.  Army  will  continue  to  consume  significant  quantities  of  foreign 
oil,  gas,  and  metals.  Jet  fuel  consumption  for  defense  purposes  will  continue  to  account  for  the  bulk  of 
petroleum  consumption  in  the  defense  sector. 

This  study  will  examine  the  present  and  future  of  United  States  resource  production,  consumption 
and  availability,  emphasizing  trends  and  their  impact  on  the  U.S.  Army.  The  terrain  has  been  covered 
before.  The  Club  of  Rome’s  The  Limits  to  Growth  and  the  U.S.  government’s  Global  2000  are  perhaps 
the  two  best  known  reports  on  resources  of  the  United  States  and  the  world.  The  bulk  of  the  information, 
however,  came  from  more  recent  publications  written  by  experts  from  both  the  private  and  public  sectors. 

The  timing  of  the  study  could  hardly  be  more  fortuitous.  This  work  began  as  hostilities  in  the 
Persian  Gulf  unfolded.  In  the  midst  of  our  research,  the  Department  of  Energy  released  the  long-awaited 
National  Energy  Strategy.  Because  these  two  events  have  consequences  for  the  future  of  U.S.  resource 
production  and  consumption,  they  shall  be  discussed  in  subsequent  sections.  Resources  are  treated  in 
categories  such  as  food  and  water,  mineral  fuels,  nonfuel  minerals,  within  which  are  found  strategic  and 
critical  materials.  This  study  will  also  discuss  briefly  resources  of  the  global  commons:  materials  of  the 
seas  and  atmosphere,  the  ozone  layer,  and  space  in  near-earth  orbit  for  satellites,  for  example. 

Briefly,  the  resource  outlook  for  the  United  States  is  either  partly  cloudy  or  partly  sunny, 
depending  upon  one’s  perspective.  In  contrast  to  the  points  of  view  of  many  author/futurists  in  the  field 
of  resource  research  and  analysis,  there  is  neither  an  impending  apocalypse  nor  El  Dorado.  The  U.S. 
future  with  respect  to  resources  is  somewhere  in  between,  more  like  California.  The  thesis  is  that  the 
Golden  State  in  particular  and  the  United  States  in  general  are  moving  into  a  transition  period  marked 
by  the  challenge  of  shifting  from  a  society  of  abundance  and  conspicuous  consumption,  which  is 
increasingly  unaffordable,  to  a  society  not  necessarily  of  scarcity,  but  rather  of  moderation,  perhaps 
toward  the  end  of  the  forecast  period  even  of  national  thrift. 

The  armed  forces,  accounting  for  fully  80  percent  of  the  government’s  energy  consumption,  will 
not  remain  insulated  from  the  primary  features  of  this  transition  period. 

Finally,  this  study  considers  some  probable  resource  requirements  of  emerging  technologies  and 
alternative  resources  and  the  prospects  that  major  changes  will  take  place  in  the  next  25  years  to 
ameliorate  some  of  the  most  challenging  resource-related  problems:  acid  rain,  hazardous  waste,  and 
pollution;  import  dependence;  a  legacy  of  scarcity;  and  so  forth.

FOOD  AND  WATER 


With  the  exception  of  1988,  the  year  of  a  major  drought,  for  the  past  50  years  the  United  States 
has  produced  much  more  food  than  it  consumed  in  a  given  year.  The  assessment  is  that  this  beneficial 
trend  will  continue,  barring  any  unforeseen  catastrophe,  such  as  northward  migration  of  the  country’s 
breadbasket  caused  by  persistent  droughts  from  changes  in  the  world’s  climate,  that  is,  global  warming, 
which  is  possible,  but  unlikely  to  occur  by  2015.  The  on-going  debate  over  global  warming  will  have 
been  settled  one  way  or  another  long  before  2015. 

Overall  more  judicious  use  and  conservation  of  adequate  water  resources  is  expected.  In  the 
west,  however,  costly  major  water  redistribution  projects  (e.g.,  plan  to  pipe  fresh  water  from  Alaska  to 
California)  or  the  construction  of  large  desalinization  facilities  are  likely.  Water  management  and 
conservation  will  be  a  key  factor  in  sustaining  the  country’s  position  as  the  world’s  principal  farmer  and 
grocer.  It  should  maintain  this  position  by  virtue  of  U.S.  agriculture’s  ability  to  produce  more  crops  on 
reduced  acreage,  a  trend  that  will  continue. 

With  respect  to  key  minerals,  namely  sulfur,  potash  and  phosphate  rock,  supporting  the  world’s 
largest  and  most  productive  agroindustry,  the  country  is  well-positioned  to  satisfy  its  needs  from  its  own 
ample  stocks  in  the  case  of  sulfur  and  phosphate  rock,  or  from  a  friendly  foreign  supplier,  for  example, 
Canada  for  potash,  out  to  the  year  2015. 

As  a  result  of  these  developments,  the  men  and  women  of  the  U.S.  armed  forces  in  the  year  2015 
will  be  as  well,  or  even  better  clothed  and  fed  than  those  who  have  served  before  them. 


ENERGY 

Plentiful  and  inexpensive  sources  of  energy  have  played  a  key  role  in  making  the  United  States 
the  20th  century’s  economic  and  military  powerhouse.  For  the  first  half  of  the  century,  the  country 
developed  while  producing  more  energy  than  it  consumed.  In  1950  the  United  States  produced  almost 
34  quadrillion  Btu  of  energy,  while  consuming  33  quads.1  Since  1958,  however,  the  United  States  has 
had  to  rely  on  foreign  sources  to  satisfy  its  energy  requirements  in  full.  In  1989,  it  consumed  81  quads, 
or  approximately  15  more  quads  than  it  produced.  Twenty  percent  of  U.S.  energy  in  1989  originated 
in  foreign  countries:  natural  gas  in  Canada  and,  most  important,  crude  oil  in  various  countries,  primarily 
Saudi  Arabia,  Nigeria,  Mexico,  Canada,  and  Venezuela. 

Without  the  desire  or  wherewithal  to  substitute  other  energy  sources  or  to  export  commodities 
of  equivalent  value,  the  United  States  has  gradually  consumed  its  way  into  a  position  of  vulnerability  and 


lA  "quad"  (1  quadrillion  British  thermal  units)  is  a  standard  unit  used  in  comparing  large  amounts 
of  energy.  One  quad  is  roughly  equivalent  to  1  year’s  worth  of  oil  used  at  the  rate  of  500,000  barrels 
a  day. 


88 


potential  economic  and  national  insecurity.  The  projection  is  that  the  trend  drivers,  high  foreign  oil 
imports  and  failure  to  identify,  produce  and  sell  equivalent  value  export  commodities,  will  proceed  apace. 

With  the  exception  of  nuclear  energy,  which  came  on  stream  in  1957,  for  the  past  century  the 
United  States  has  relied  on  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  to  satisfy  most  of  its  energy  needs  (85  percent  in 
1990).  Throughout  the  century,  coal,  oil  and  gas  have  vied  with  each  other  as  the  predominant  fuel  in 
domestic  production:  coal  in  1949-51  and  again  in  1982  and  1984-89;  in  the  interim  first  crude  oil  and 
then  natural  gas  dominated.  In  terms  of  consumption,  however,  oil  has  been  the  predominant  energy 
source  since  1950.  Unfortunately,  in  the  forecast  period,  the  U.S.  economy  will  become  even  more 
dependent  upon  fossil  fuels  than  it  was  in  1990,  with  attendant  negative  economic  and  environmental 
consequences.  Some  portion  of  two  of  the  three  primary  fossil  fuels  will  have  to  be  imported,  much  of 
it  from  politically  and  economically  unstable  areas. 

QU 


Because  oil  is  and  will  remain  in  the  forecast  period  the  primary  source  of  energy  for  the  United 
States  and  the  U.S.  Army,  it  is  appropriate  that  the  study  of  individual  mineral  fuels  begins  here. 

Although  used  since  ancient  times,  oil  as  an  industry  began  in  1859  when  the  first  commercial 
well  was  drilled  in  western  Pennsylvania.  Over  the  years  Americans  have  tended  to  view  inexpensive 
and  plentiful  oil  and  its  most  important  derivative,  gasoline,  as  a  kind  of  birthright.  (In  1990  bottled 
water  in  some  supermarkets  was  more  expensive  than  gasoline.)  Regrettably,  each  succeeding  generation 
of  consumers  has  been  passing  on  to  the  next  a  greatly  shrunken  reservoir  of  domestic  oil.  Crude  oil 
reserves  stood  at  44  billion  barrels  in  1970;  26.5  billion  in  1990.  While  it  is  always  difficult  to  predict 
reserves  with  any  precision,  if  trends  continue  by  2015  U.S.  proved  reserves  of  crude  oil  may  be  down 
to  about  14  billion  barrels,  the  equivalent  of  about  two  years  of  national  consumption. 

In  1990  about  42  percent  of  the  oil  consumed  in  the  United  States  was  imported,  24 
percent  of  which  came  from  OPEC  countries.  By  2015,  the  United  States  is  likely  to  be  importing 
between  55  to  70  percent  of  its  petroleum  demand.  Much  of  the  imported  oil  will  come  from  Middle 
Eastern  countries,  whose  share  of  world  reserves  in  the  period  is  projected  to  increase  substantially,  as 
production  and  new  discoveries  slip  elsewhere.  Production  in  the  Soviet  Union,  in  1990  the  world’s 
largest  producer  of  crude  oil,  peaked  in  1988  and  has  started  what  many  analysts  believe  will  be  a  long 
and  steady  decline.  In  February  1991,  Pravda  reported  that  the  Soviet  Union  will  become  a  net  importer 
of  oil  as  early  as  1993  if  trends  continue.  For  the  United  States,  the  energy  picture,  in  contrast  to  the 
food  outlook,  is  distressing  primarily  because  oil  is  and  will  remain  the  lifeblood  of  our  highly  mobile, 
automobile-based  economy,  society  and  culture.  In  1990  about  35  percent  of  the  world’s  registered 
vehicles  were  in  operation  on  U.S.  roads,  most  of  which  are  asphalt,  another  petroleum-derived  product. 
Much  of  the  American  way  of  life  is  dependent  on  the  future  availability  and  low  price  of  a  single 
commodity:  oil  and  critical  by-products.  Petroleum  feedstocks  for  the  petrochemical  industry,  whose 
importance  for  defense  purposes  will  increase  as  advanced  materials  and  composites  develop,  are 


89 


projected  to  rise  by  67  percent  over  the  next  25  years.

Middle  East  Proved  Oil  Reserves  (1989  percentage  of  world  total):  58.  [2] 

The  strategic  nature  of  oil  was  first  highlighted  in  1975  when  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve 
(SPR)  was  created  and  filling  of  cavernous  salt  domes  in  the  southwest  began.  Before  President  Bush 
authorized  the  release  of  stocks  from  the  SPR  in  1991,  there  were  about  580  million  barrels  in  the 
reserve;  it  is  projected  to  increase  to  750  million  barrels  by  2000  and  ultimately  hold  up  to  1  billion 
barrels  (at  current  consumption  rates,  a  scant  two-month  supply).  In  DOE’s  words,  the  SPR  is  a  means 
"to  effectively  address  shortrun  oil  market  disruptions."  [16] 

Since  it  stopped  relying  on  horsepower  early  in  the  20th  century,  the  U.S.  Army  has  mostly  used 
fossil  fiiels  to  power  its  land  and  air  vehicles,  warm  its  barracks,  and  generate  electricity  for  its  facilities. 
Until  1950,  when  the  United  States  began  to  consume  more  oil  than  it  produced,  use  of  this  fuel  had 
marginal  implications  for  national  security.  Despite  intermittent  murmuring  on  behalf  of  Texas 
independence,  fuel  supplies  to  the  civilian  and  military  sectors  were  safe  and  secure. 

In  the  period  under  analysis,  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  and  the  U.S.  Army  will  continue  to  rely  for 


90 


the  most  part  on  forms  of  transportation  powered  by  petroleum-derived  products.  The  expectation  is  that 
the  primary  elements  of  future  ground  force  weaponry,  for  example,  tanks,  armored  personnel  carriers, 
helicopters,  and  self-propelled  artillery  mounts,  will  probably  be  larger,  heavier,  faster,  and  more  lethal 
than  their  predecessors,  consuming  greater  inputs  of  fuel,  ammunition  and  spare  parts. 

The  analysis  of  resources  is  inseparable  from  the  assessment  of  the  future  geopolitical  situation. 
The  Middle  East  will  continue  to  be  one  of  the  world’s  most  volatile  and  unpredictable  regions,  a  region 
in  which  substantial  U.S.  military  forces  are  likely  to  be  based  and  engaged  in  hostilities  periodically. 
Eventually  the  conservative  autocratic  regimes  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Kuwait,  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates 
will  be  replaced  with  new  leadership,  who  may  or  may  not  be  compatible  with  American  national 
interests  and  values. 

In  1961  and  1991  British  and  American  and  allied  forces  were  committed  to  the  Persian  Gulf  to 
rescue  Kuwait,  in  the  first  instance  threatened  by  its  neighbor  Iraq  and  thirty  years  later  invaded,  occupied 
and  ravaged  by  that  country.  Since  1950  there  have  been  four  major  wars  and  numerous  international 
crises  in  the  Middle  East  and  Southwest  Asia,  a  region  destined  to  function  as  the  world’s  de  facto 
strategic  petroleum  reserve.  As  the  world’s  foremost  economic  and  military  power  into  the  next  century, 
the  United  States  inevitably  will  be  engaged  in  safeguarding  the  production  and  distribution  of  Middle 
East  oil. 

President  Jimmy  Carter  characterized  the  energy  crises  of  the  1970’s  as  the  "moral  equivalent  of 
war"  and,  despite  the  ridicule  and  scorn  this  statement  engendered,  he  and  his  administration  acted 
accordingly:  the  Department  of  Energy  was  set  up  in  1977;  minimum  fuel  and  electric  efficiency 
requirements  were  mandated;  and  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  began  to  be  filled. 

In  1990  the  energy  crisis  (in  the  form  of  Iraq’s  actual  and  threatened  hostile  takeover  of  two 
countries  with  the  largest  proved  reserves  of  oil)  was  transformed  from  the  moral  equivalent  of  war  into 
the  real  thing.  Thousands  of  lives  were  sacrificed  and  billions  of  dollars  and  dinars  were  spent,  first  by 
Iraq  seizing  and  then  by  the  United  States  liberating  Kuwait  and  protecting  Saudi  Arabia.  Coincidentally, 
in  1991  during  the  Persian  Gulf  war  the  Department  of  Energy  released  the  National  Energy  Strategy, 
designed  to  ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  energy  to  meet  United  States  future  needs  to  the  year  2015  and 
beyond.  Initial  analysis  of  the  strategy  indicates  an  emphasis  on  market  forces  and  incentives,  expansion 
of  nuclear  capacity,  and  modest  increases  in  alternate  fuels  and  renewable  energy  sources.  In  terms  of 
potential,  it  fails  to  recognize  and  exploit  fully  two  of  the  most  readily  available  sources  of  energy: 
conservation  and  recycling  or  secondary  use  of  resources. 

In  the  forecast  period,  the  assessment  is  that  no  segment  of  U.S.  society  will  be  able  to  consume 
energy  at  current  rates  without  jeopardizing  the  country’s  economic  and  environmental  health.  Instead 
it  is  expected  that  the  Federal  government  and  the  armed  forces  in  particular  will  be  called  upon  to 
undergo  an  environmental  and  ecological  conversion  in  attitudes  toward  resource  use  and  re-use. 

Natural  Gas 


91 


Even  though  the  United  States  became  a  net  importer  of  natural  gas  in  1958,  the  outlook  for  this 
fossil  fuel  is  much  brighter  than  for  oil.  In  the  forecast  period,  the  United  States  will  increase  domestic 
production  of  natural  gas,  but  not  at  a  pace  to  keep  up  with  projected  consumption.  Net  imports  are 
projected  to  double  from  1.3  trillion  cubic  feet  in  1990  (7  percent  of  consumption)  to  about  3  trillion 
cubic  feet  in  2015  (14  percent). 

In  the  forecast  period,  most  of  U.S.  imported  gas  will  continue  to  come  from  Canada,  a  reliable 
source.  Over  the  next  20  years,  the  price  of  natural  gas  is  projected  to  rise  to  a  point  where  imports  from 
Mexico  are  expected  to  come  on  stream. 

In  terms  of  national  security  and  compared  to  oil,  natural  gas  is  not  considered  a  critical  or 
strategic  material.  The  U.S.  armed  forces  are  not  major  users  of  natural  gas.  It  satisfied  just  6.6  percent 
of  defense  energy  requirements  in  1990,  down  from  7.6  percent  in  1980. 

Coal 


Coal  is  the  one  fossil  fuel  of  which  the  United  States  has  an  ample  supply,  taking  into  account 
every  production/consumption  scenario.  In  contrast  to  both  oil  and  natural  gas,  in  the  forecast  period 
domestic  coal  production  will  continue  to  outstrip  consumption.  Coal  exports  will  increase  significantly, 
although  not  nearly  rapidly  enough  to  compensate  for  mounting  imports  of  oil  and  natural  gas. 

While  still  a  cause  for  concern,  the  negative  environmental  consequences  of  coal  mining  and 
production  and  its  consumption  as  a  fuel  in  electricity  generation  are  expected  to  be  mitigated  by 
production  breakthroughs  (clean  coal  technology)  in  the  forecast  period. 

Overall,  coal’s  share  in  primary  energy  consumption  of  fuels  is  projected  to  increase  from  22 
percent  in  1990  to  about  28  percent  in  2015. 

Uranium 


As  a  basic  material  for  commercial  nuclear  power  and  plutonium  for  nuclear  weapons,  uranium 
is  a  doubly  strategic  material.  Since  1982,  the  United  States  has  been  a  net  importer  of  uranium.  In 
1988,  the  United  States  continued  to  lead  the  world  in  the  production  of  uranium,  but  imported  ore 
accounted  for  96  percent  of  total  U.S.  production.  Although  the  United  States  has  adequate  domestic 
supplies  of  uranium  to  satisfy  its  requirements  for  both  purposes  in  the  forecast  period,  price  advantages, 
as  in  the  case  of  iron  ore  mining  and  processing,  have  led  the  industry  to  buy  mined  uranium  abroad, 
primarily  from  Canada. 

In  the  forecast  period,  the  share  of  nuclear  power  for  total  electric  generation  is  projected  to 
decline  from  20  percent  in  1990  to  about  14  percent  in  2015.  No  new  nuclear  power  plants  have  been 
ordered  since  the  Three  Mile  Island  accident  derailed  the  program  in  1978.  Replacing  older  plants  would 
require  substantial  inputs  of  generating  capacity  in  the  2000-2020  timeframe,  which  appears  unlikely 
owing  to  perceived  safety  and  environmental  impacts.  The  service  lives  of  existing  plants  may  be 


92 


extended,  which  should  slow  the  rate  of  decline.  If  operating  experience  with  fission  plants  abroad  (for 
example,  France  and  Spain)  continues  to  be  satisfactory,  public  concern  over  safety  and  the  environment 
can  be  satisfied  by  safer  plant  design,  and  the  waste  disposal  problem  is  solved,  the  United  States  may 
once  again  turn  to  nuclear  fission  as  a  power  source.  Nuclear  power  plants  will  have  to  be  cost-effective, 
however,  to  be  acceptable  to  industry. 

Energy  from  nuclear  fusion,  cold  or  otherwise,  so  promising  just  a  few  months  ago,  according 
to  the  National  Energy  Strategy  is  now  not  expected  to  be  commercially  available  until  2040. 

Oil  Shale 

Depending  upon  the  price  and  availability  of  the  primary  fossil  fuels  examined  above  and 
technology  developments,  oil  extracted  from  extensive  shale  deposits  in  the  United  States  may  come  into 
production  and  use  in  the  forecast  period.  This  should  be  viewed  as  a  wild  card  at  best,  but  one  that 
would  substantially  reduce  import  dependency  and  redirect  trend  drivers  in  the  United  States’  favor. 

Renewable  Energy  Sources 

The  major  sources  of  renewable  energy  are  hydropower,  solar  thermal,  geothermal,  ocean 
thermal,  photovoltaics,  wind,  and  biofuels.  Biofuels  include  such  categories  as  energy  from  trash  and 
organic  waste,  sewer  gas,  wood,  methanol  and  ethanol. 

In  1990  renewables  accounted  for  about  7  percent  of  total  energy  consumed  in  the  United  States. 
By  2015  they  are  expected  to  increase  to  approximately  9  percent  of  total  energy  consumption.  This 
figure  could  be  considerably  higher  if  incineration  of  municipal  waste  is  selected  as  the  optimal  solution 
to  the  problem  of  shrinking  landfill  space  and  garbage  disposal,  or  if  states  follow  California’s  lead  and 
legislate  conversion  of  a  portion  of  the  fleet  to  methanol  or  ethanol  fuels. 

Various  regions  of  the  United  States  will  accelerate  the  development  of  such  energy  sources,  and 
California  in  particular  will  break  new  ground  in  the  widespread  application  of  solar  thermal,  geothermal, 
biofuel,  wind  and  possibly  ocean  thermal  sources  of  energy.  Wholesale  application  of  such  power 
sources  in  other  parts  of  the  country  will  be  constrained  by  both  the  forces  of  inertia  and  nature. 

In  concluding  the  analysis  of  the  mineral  fuels  section,  it  is  expected  that  in  the  forecast  period 
the  United  States  and  its  armed  forces  will  continue  to  rely  on  fossil  fuels  to  satisfy  a  diminishing,  but 
still  voracious  appetite  for  energy.  In  2015  power  for  land  and  air  vehicles,  for  vessels,  and  for 
residential  and  commercial  heat  and  air  conditioning  will  come  from  traditional  sources  roughly  in  the 
following  proportions:

NONFUEL  MINERALS 

Energy  crises  of  the  1970’s  and  the  recession  in  the  early  1980’s  so  battered  the  mining  and 
metals  industry  that  articles  appeared  announcing  the  "death  of  mining"  in  the  United  States.  The  rebound 
in  the  second  half  of  the  1980’s  proved  once  again  that  death  reports  can  be  greatly  exaggerated. 
Nevertheless,  compared  to  its  former  dominance  in  mining  and  production  of  key  minerals  throughout 
the  first  half  of  the  century,  the  U.S.  metals  industry  has  lost  much  of  its  luster.  With  one  or  two  minor 
exceptions,  molybdenum  and  magnesium  for  example,  the  industry’s  competitiveness  has  slipped  in  the 
global  marketplace,  and  import  reliance  has  climbed  for  many  critical  minerals  and  materials.  As 
additional  critical  materials  move  up  the  import  reliance  scale  and  join  the  ranks  of  columbium,  chromium 
and  platinum,  it  is  expected  that  this  trend  will  continue  in  the  forecast  period. 

There  are  more  than  one  hundred  commodities  in  the  nonfuel  minerals  category.  United  States 
prospects  vary  considerably  by  subcategory.  Overall  the  future  does  not  look  as  bright  as  for  food  and 
water,  nor  as  distressing  as  the  prospects  for  mineral  fuels.  In  a  sense,  the  U.S.  nonfuel  commodities 
hopper  is  either  half  empty  or  half  full. 

Prospects  are  best  for  the  group  of  nonmetallic  minerals  because  estimated  U.S.  primary 
production  into  the  next  century  is  projected  to  equal  or  exceed  forecast  primary  demand  for  more  than 
half  the  commodities  listed.  Some  of  these  minerals  are  boron,  sulfur,  and  chlorine.  The  opposite  trend 
is  forecast  for  the  group  of  metals  and  mineral-forming  elements.  If  estimates  are  on  target,  U.S. 
primary  production  will  equal  demand  for  just  20  percent  of  the  commodities  listed  and  fall  far  short  for 
such  essential  defense-related  metals  as  aluminum,  cadmium,  gallium,  gold,  silver,  nickel,  tungsten,  and 
vanadium.  Thus,  as  one  of  the  most  metals-intensive  sectors  of  the  economy,  the  U.S.  defense  and 
associated  high-technology  industries  will  be  confronted  with  a  half  empty  or  three  quarters  empty  nonfuel 
commodities  hopper. 

The  1990  Statistical  Abstract  of  the  United  States  contains  a  table  that  lists  58  nonfuel  minerals. 
Following  a  familiar  pattern,  for  42  of  these  commodities  the  United  States  consumes  more  than  it 
produces.  Despite  the  trend  toward  declining  material  intensity  of  use  for  most  commodities  in  the 
United  States,  as  recently  as  1981  each  American  that  year  used  more  than  18,000  pounds  of  nonfuel 


94 


minerals.  In  1991,  owing  to  the  war  in  the  Persian  Gulf,  per  capita  indices  for  the  armed  forces  will 
surely  be  much  higher. 

Although  import  reliance  may  vary  considerably  from  year  to  year  or  be  withheld  to  avoid 
disclosure,  the  trend  for  some  key  minerals  is  disquieting.  For  fourteen  commodities,  for  example, 
import  reliance  ranges  between  90-100  percent.  These  are  arsenic,  bauxite  (from  which  aluminum  is 
made),  cesium,  columbium,  graphite,  gem  stones,  manganese,  mica,  rubidium,  strontium,  thallium, 
diamond  (industrial),  asbestos,  and  fluorspar.  In  the  next  part  of  this  study  the  future  criticality  and 
availability  of  some  of  these  minerals  and  other  key  materials  on  the  list  of  strategic  materials  will  be 
considered  (see  Fig.  3). 


STRATEGIC  AND  CRITICAL  MATERIALS 

Prompted  to  respond  to  a  war  or  national  emergency,  the  United  States  has  prudently  established 
fuel  and  nonfuel  mineral  stockpiles  to  ensure  adequate  supplies  in  time  of  crisis.  The  Strategic  Petroleum 
Reserve  was  created  in  response  to  a  crisis  in  the  supply  of  oil.  Similarly,  the  United  States  by  law 
maintains  a  stockpile  of  strategic  and  critical  materials  that  are  1)  not  found  or  produced  in  the  United 
States  in  sufficient  quantity,  and  2)  required  to  supply  military,  industrial  and  essential  civilian  needs  in 
a  national  defense  emergency.  As  of  January  1990  there  were  94  commodities  in  the  National  Defense 
Stockpile  (NDS),  which  was  transferred  in  1988  from  the  General  Services  Administration  to  the 
Department  of  Defense.

Note:  As  of  1/1/90  there  were  94  commodities  in  the  SDS. 

Only  45  are  listed  because  the  remaining  items  are  forms 
of  these  commodities.  For  example,  there  are  seven  items 

listed  under  chromite  and  chromium  and  nine  under 
manganese.  [14] 


Aside  from  steel,  aluminum  and  lead,  there  are  at  least  30  metals  of  critical  importance  to  the 
U.S.  military  and  the  army.  After  all,  weapons  and  materiel  are  largely  manufactured  of  metal.  In 
varying  degrees  these  include  metals  from  six  major  categories:  base  metals;  steel  industry  metals;  light 
metals;  precious  metals;  platinum  group  metals;  and  electronic  metals. 

In  the  next  part  of  this  study  prospects  for  production,  consumption  and  availability  of  these 
metals  to  the  year  2015  are  studied.  Especially  critical  materials  will  be  treated  individually;  in  some 
cases  materials  will  be  examined  as  a  group. 

Three  of  the  most  important  minerals  for  national  defense  and  associated  high-technology  industry 
are  and  should  remain  chromium,  titanium,  and  cobalt. 


97 


Chromium 


The  United  States  Army  War  College  (USAWC)  has  devised  an  index  to  assess  the  relative 
vulnerability  of  the  United  States  with  respect  to  strategic  materials.  Heading  it  and  most  lists  of  strategic 
materials  is  chromium,  with  the  highest  USAWC  Vulnerability  Index  rating  (34).  The  United  States 
stockpiles  and  will  continue  to  stockpile  substantial  reserves  of  chromium  for  compelling  reasons:  since 
1960,  with  the  exception  of  a  small  amount  in  1976,  no  chromite  has  been  produced  in  the  U.S.;  U.S. 
foreign  dependence  ranges  between  70  and  90  percent  and  imports  come  from  four  suppliers,  the 
Republic  of  South  Africa  and  Zimbabwe,  Turkey,  and  Yugoslavia.  Chromium  has  five  major  military 
uses  (ammunition,  armor  plate,  gun  barrels,  jet  engines  and  stainless  steel);  and  there  are  no  fully 
satisfactory  substitutes  for  most  military  applications  of  chromium. 

The  assessment  is  that  since  much  of  the  world  supply  of  chromite  is  concentrated  in  unstable  or, 
until  recently,  traditionally  hostile  host  countries,  South  Africa  and  the  Soviet  Union,  stockpiling  of  this 
ferroalloy  will  continue  to  be  a  national  priority  in  the  forecast  period. 

Titanium 


The  primary  mineral  sources  for  titanium  are  rutile  and  ilmenite.  Sponge  metal  is  made  from 
rutile  and  both  elements  are  included  in  the  NDS. 

In  contrast  to  many  minerals,  titanium  use  in  the  U.S.  economy  and  military  is  expected  to  grow 
at  a  relatively  high  rate  in  the  forecast  period.  In  the  form  of  titanium  dioxide,  it  will  continue  to  be  used 
as  pigment  for  coatings,  paints,  ceramics,  and  fiberglass.  Because  of  titanium’s  high  strength  to  weight 
ratio,  as  a  metal  it  will  remain  an  important  construction  component  in  aerospace  manufacturing  and 
marine  equipment.  Consumption  may  increase  substantially  if  a  national  commitment  is  undertaken  to 
develop  hypersonic  air  transport,  expand  the  fleet  of  strategic  bombers,  or  deploy  one  or  more  U.S.  space 
stations. 

Most  of  the  world’s  rutile,  which  is  95  percent  titanium  dioxide,  is  produced  in  four  countries: 
the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  Australia,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Sierra  Leone.  Titanium  slag  is  imported  by  the 
United  States  from  Canada. 

On  the  USAWC’s  index,  titanium  was  assigned  a  value  of  20,  ranking  in  the  middle  of  eleven 
minerals.  The  major  supplier  countries  were  listed  as  Canada  and  Australia,  which  mitigates  the  level 
of  vulnerability,  as  these  countries  are  deemed  friendly  reliable  suppliers.  The  assessment  is  that  these 
two  countries  will  remain  important  allies  in  the  forecast  period. 

Platinum  Group  Metals  (PGM) 

Six  metals  make  up  the  platinum  group:  platinum,  palladium,  rhodium,  ruthenium,  iridium,  and 
osmium.  Most  of  the  world’s  supply  of  PGM  comes  from  just  two  countries:  South  Africa  and  the  Soviet 


98 


Union.  In  the  forecast  period,  political  uncertainty  and  potential  revolutionary  forces  in  those  countries 
could  cause  disruptions  in  the  supply  of  these  and  other  critical  materials  concentrated  there.  After 
chromium,  PGM  with  a  score  of  32  were  second  on  the  USAWC’s  vulnerability  list. 

PGM  consumption  could  greatly  exceed  projections  if,  for  example,  Eastern  Europe  and  the 
Soviet  Union  switch  to  unleaded  gasoline  (platinum  for  catalytic  converters)  or  if  the  experimental 
technology  of  fuel  cells  is  developed  by  2015. 

Because  of  their  importance  in  electrical,  electronic,  and  chemical  processing  applications,  two 
PGM,  rhodium  and  ruthenium  were  among  four  materials  on  the  Secretary  of  Defense’s  list  of 
recommended  additions  to  the  NDS  in  1989. 

Cobalt 


Cobalt,  another  stockpiled  material,  has  broad  application  in  high-technology  industries  such  as 
telecommunications  and  aerospace,  as  well  as  significant  military  uses  for  jet  engines  and  superalloys. 
For  its  primary  cobalt  consumption,  the  United  States  is  100  percent  dependent  on  foreign  sources, 
deriving  about  equal  shares  from  one  politically  stable  and  reliable  source,  Canada,  and  two 
comparatively  unstable  sources,  Zaire  and  Zambia. 

Stocks  of  cobalt  have  been  increased  in  response  to  political  turmoil  in  southern  Africa.  In 
general,  centrally  planned  economies  and  southern  Africa  produce  about  75  percent  of  the  world’s  supply 
of  four  critical  minerals:  chromium;  platinum  group;  cobalt;  and  manganese.  In  fact  South  Africa  has 
been  called  the  "nonfuel  minerals  Saudi  Arabia"  (see  Fig.  4).  In  the  forecast  period,  the  assessment  is 
that  other  strategic  material  stocks  may  need  to  be  augmented  as  instability  and  turmoil  continue  to  buffet 
these  areas.  Assuming  stability  in  Brazil,  that  country  should  continue  to  be  an  important  source  of 
critical  materials  (columbium,  mica,  and  manganese,  for  example)  to  U.S.  defense  and  high  technology 
industries. 

Manganese 

The  United  States  was  100  percent  dependent  on  foreign  sources  for  its  apparent  consumption  of 
750,000  short  tons  in  1990.  Five  countries  were  the  major  suppliers  of  ore:  Gabon,  Brazil,  Australia, 
Republic  of  South  Africa,  and  France.  There  are  no  effective  substitutes  for  manganese  in  its  primary 
applications:  steel  production,  dry  cell  batteries,  plant  fertilizers,  and  animal  feed. 


RESOURCES  FOR  EMERGING  TECHNOLOGIES 

Under  no  plausible  scenario  will  U.S.  society  or  its  armed  forces  in  the  forecast  period  dispense 
altogether  with  such  traditionally  critical  resources  as  rubber,  steel,  lead,  or  aluminum.  It  is  probable, 


99 


however,  that  in  the  next  25  years,  in  relative  terms,  these  resources  will  decline  in  importance  compared 
to  resources  required  as  basic  building  blocks  in  emerging  technologies,  specifically  composites  and 
advanced  materials. 

For  example,  as  they  have  for  centuries,  it  is  expected  that  metals  will  be  a  primary  agent  of 
lethality  in  some  21st  century  weapons.  And  yet  it  is  also  envisioned  that  in  the  forecast  period  a 
situation  in  which  non-metallic  lethal,  or  even  non-lethal,  agents  will  be  used  to  neutralize  an  enemy. 
These  may  be  anesthetic  or  particle-beam  "phaser"  weapons. 

Here  again  the  U.S.  outlook  is  cloudy.  On  the  one  hand,  with  its  petrochemical  industry,  the 
United  States  has  a  powerful  and  well  developed  base  to  remain  on  the  cutting  edge  of  innovations  in  the 
field  of  polymers  of  almost  any  kind:  ceramic,  metallic  or  organic  polymers.  On  the  other  hand,  as  an 
intense  user  of  energy  and  petroleum  feedstocks,  the  industry  will  accelerate  the  tempo  of  increasing 
dependence  on  foreign  energy  suppliers. 

It  is  likely  that  high-techology  hardware  of  the  future  will  carry  a  higher  percentage  of  material 
of  the  rare  earth  metals  (thorium,  yttrium,  cerium)  group.  Fortunately,  the  United  States  in  1990  was 
a  leading  producer  and  processor  of  rare  earths  and  was  a  major  exporter  and  consumer  of  rare  earth 
products.  In  relative  terms,  the  U.S.  position  is  stronger  in  this  group  in  the  forecast  period.

ELECTRONIC  METALS 


When  it  comes  to  warfare,  resources  often  determine  not  only  where  an  army  will  fight  (e.g., 
oil  in  the  Persian  Gulf),  but  also  how  it  will  fight  (germanium  in  night  vision  devices  and  infrared  target 
acquisition).  If  the  Gulf  War  is  any  indication  of  warfare  to  come,  and  it  is  believed  to  be,  in  terms  of 
future  applications,  the  electronic  group  of  metals,  among  which  are  silicon,  cadmium,  gallium, 
germanium,  and  tantalum,  will  largely  determine  how  effectively  the  future  U.S.  Army  wages  war.

Consequently,  the  production,  consumption,  and  availability  of  these  minerals  will  be  of  keen 
interest  to  the  United  States  and  its  armed  forces.  High-technology  and  defense  industries  will  rely  on 
these  metals  to  make  "smart"  weapons  "brilliant."  In  the  next  generation  of  computers,  missiles,  and 
helicopters,  semiconductors,  superconductors,  and  wafers  manufactured  of  these  materials  will  largely 
shape  success  or  failure  on  the  battlefield. 

In  this  group,  five  of  nine  metals  are  in  the  NDS.  These  are  silicon,  cadmium,  germanium, 
tantalum,  and  indium.  Most  estimates  indicate  that  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  and  the  U.S.  Army  will  invest 
a  greater  proportion  of  budgetary  outlays  and  boost  their  share  of  consumption  of  these  metals  as 
components  in  a  myriad  of  electronics  devices. 


102 


As  one  of  the  most  abundant  minerals  in  the  earth’s  crust,  silicon  is  not  expected  to  pose  a 
problem  in  terms  of  supply.  In  1990  the  U.S.  relied  on  friendly  reliable  foreign  sources  for  30  percent 
of  its  apparent  consumption.  Gallium  arsenide  and  germanium  are  acceptable  substitutes  for  silicon  in 
semiconductor  and  infrared  applications.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  reverse  is  not  true,  namely  silicon 
is  not  an  acceptable  substitute  for  gallium  arsenide-base  integrated  circuits  in  many  defense-related 
applications.  Although  there  is  currently  an  oversupply  of  gallium  in  the  world  and  it  is  not  a  stockpiled 
commodity,  it  may  join  the  stockpile  in  the  forecast  period  as  applications  increase. 

The  other  four  stockpiled  metals  in  this  group  are  cadmium,  germanium,  tantalum,  and  indium. 
As  computer  and  electronics  technology  forge  ahead  in  such  fields  as  artificial  intelligence,  these  metals 
will  constitute  a  larger  share  in  defense-essential  components,  and  their  proportion  in  the  stockpile  should 
increase  accordingly. 

On  the  subject  of  the  National  Defense  Stockpile,  in  the  forecast  period,  there  will  be  some 
significant  changes  in  both  the  size  and  composition  of  the  NDS.  Some  stockpiled  resources  are  based 
on  World  War  II  and  Korean  War  requirements:  talc,  down  and  feathers,  for  example.  The  statutory 
requirement  is  to  strive  for  the  accumulation  of  a  supply  adequate  to  fight  a  three-year  war.  Modernizing 
the  NDS  may  mean  introducing  a  greater  degree  of  flexibility  in  terms  of  duration,  lengthening  the 
requirements  for  some,  while  shortening  them  for  others. 

Overall,  throughout  the  forecast  period  the  NDS  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  an  essential  means 
of  forestalling  disruptions  in  the  supply  of  key  minerals  and  materials. 


NONCONVENTIONAL  RESOURCES:  "Global  Commons" 

The  U.S.  Armed  Forces  and  Army  will  operate  less  and  less  in  an  insulated  or  isolated 
environment,  both  in  terms  of  their  role  within  U.S.  society  and  internationally.  That  is  to  say,  as  the 
quality  of  key  common  resources  deteriorates,  specifically  air  and  water  quality  or  the  ozone  layer,  more 
attention  will  be  focused  on  the  armed  forces’  impact  on  their  surroundings,  the  environmental  health  of 
land  and  water  resources  near  its  bases  or  production  facilities.  But  the  armed  forces  may  not  only  be 
part  of  the  problem,  they  might  also  become  part  of  the  solution.  This  might  involve  both  technical  and 
human  resources.  In  particular,  defense  assets,  satellites  or  submersibles,  might  be  used  to  identify 
environmental  or  energy-related  problems  (e.g.,  acid  rain  deposition,  ozone  depletion,  build-up  of 
greenhouse  gases,  undersea  energy  or  mineral  resources)  and  help  to  resolve  or  exploit  them.  It  is 
possible  that  the  U.S.  military  will  become  involved  in  such  international  issues  as  the  allocation  of  space 
in  near-earth  orbit;  leasing,  rental  or  donation  of  military  space  technology  for  global  environmental  or 
energy  projects. 

It  is  likely  that  the  armed  forces  will  become  more  involved  in  waste  management  to  a  much 
greater  extent  than  in  the  past.  Budgeteers  have  tended  to  think  of  nuclear  weapons’  costs  as  relatively 
short-term  expenses.  In  the  process  the  problems  and  expense  of  safe  storage  and  disposal  of  radioactive 


103 


waste  were  marginalized.  In  the  forecast  period  the  United  States  is  likely  to  face  staggering  costs 
associated  not  only  with  the  design  and  manufacture  of  new  weapons,  but  also  with  the  after  effects  of 
disposing  of  radioactive  waste  from  weapons  long  retired  from  the  arsenal. 

In  terms  of  resource  conservation  and  recycling,  it  is  expected  that  U.S.  government  and  the 
armed  forces  of  the  future  will  no  longer  have  license  to  consume  resources  in  the  vast  quantities  they 
have  in  the  past.  Government  and  defense  expenditures  for  and  consumption  of  energy  and  metals  will 
be  examined  more  closely.  These  developments  will  affect  the  individual  soldier’s  training  and  service. 
In  the  forecast  period,  it  is  possible  that  the  missions  of  the  armed  forces  or  a  national  service  cadre  will 
include  performing  environmental  protection  or  resource  management  and  conservation  work  on  land  or 
at  sea.  Then  in  addition  to  the  BLUE  and  RED  teams,  there  will  be  GREEN  teams.  In  fact,  it  would 
not  be  surprising  to  see  the  U.S.  Army  before  the  year  2000  devoting  as  much  time  and  effort  to 
recycling  and  conservation  of  resources  as  it  does  in  1991  to  physical  fitness. 

Should  some  critical  land-based  resources  become  scarce  in  the  forecast  period,  the  United  States, 
alone  or  more  likely  as  part  of  an  international  consortium,  might  spearhead  an  effort  to  exploit  the 
enormous  mineral  riches  of  the  seas,  in  particular  mining  nodules  on  the  ocean  floor.  But  exploration 
and  exploitation  would  be  conducted  and  managed  with  an  unprecedented  degree  of  responsibility  and 
foresight,  perhaps  with  U.S.  Navy  expertise  and  equipment. 

As  it  enters  the  21st  century,  and  as  other  individual  countries’  roles  diminish,  the  United  States 
will  likely  assume  greater  responsibility  not  just  for  the  physical  security  of  large  areas  of  the  planet,  but 
for  the  health  of  the  global  environment  as  well.  This  responsibility  will  be  at  least  commensurate  with 
the  impact  its  economy,  industry,  and  military  has  on  the  planet’s  common  resources. 

SUMMARY  OF  PROJECTIONS  AND  IMPLICATIONS 

Research  and  analysis  of  resource  trends  to  2015  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  production, 
consumption,  and  availability  of  resources  will  continue  to  define  to  a  great  extent  the  position  of  the 
United  States  and  its  armed  forces  in  the  world.  Fortunately,  the  outlook  for  such  critical  commodities 
as  food,  water  and  medicine  and  associated  industries  is  relatively  favorable.  Nationally,  there  is  no 
expectation  of  population-based  developments  bearing  excessive  pressure  on  these  resources.  Regionally, 
parts  of  the  sunbelt  may  have  to  devise  creative  and  expensive  solutions  to  ensure  adequate  supplies  of 
water  and  electricity  in  the  forecast  period. 

The  fuels  picture  is  not  nearly  so  reassuring.  Trend  drivers  point  to  growing  dependence  on 
foreign  suppliers  for  the  U.S.  fuel  of  choice:  oil.  New  domestic  finds  for  replenishment  are  not  in  the 
offing.  Stability  of  the  Middle  East,  the  region  with  the  largest  proven  reserves,  is  also  unlikely  to 
solidify  in  the  forecast  period.  Hence  U.S.  forces  will  likely  be  deployed  there  on  a  regular,  if  not 
permanent  basis,  to  prevent  OECD  supply  disruptions  and  protect  what  will  become  in  the  coming 
decades  the  world’s  de  facto  strategic  petroleum  reserve. 


104 


Two  recent  and  unexpected  developments  in  the  fuels  area  loom  ominous.  Should  the  countries 
of  the  now  disbanded  Warsaw  Pact,  with  a  population,  area,  and  potential  market  larger  than  North 
America,  be  successful  in  their  modernization  efforts,  the  world’s  fuel  and  energy  complex,  and  the 
global  environment,  will  be  subjected  to  enormous  additional  stress.  Added  to  the  pressures  generated 
by  similar  efforts  in  the  developing  countries,  this  may  trigger  fierce  competition  among  nations  for 
access  to  a  rapidly  depleting  oil  supply. 

A  wild  card  in  this  scenario  would  be  a  situation  in  which  a  reformed,  democratic  Soviet  Union 
or  Russia,  with  the  West’s  assistance,  finds  and  exploits  huge  new  petroleum  deposits,  thus  reducing  the 
importance  of  Middle  Eastern  oil  reserves  for  the  global  economy.  The  surplus,  probably  from  Siberia, 
would  then  be  exported  to  the  West  and  United  States  in  return  for  high-technology  imports. 

Less  likely  is  rapid  progress  toward  alternate  fuels  or  futuristic  non-conventional  power  packs  for 
transportation  (hydrogen-powered  vehicles,  for  example).  Just  a  handful  of  corporations  or  corporate 
nations  own  and  control  most  of  the  petroleum/automotive  mega-industry.  Revolutionary  efforts  on  their 
part  are  not  anticipated  any  time  soon  to  reduce  the  developed  world’s  dependence  on  oil  and  gasoline 
and  the  internal  combustion  engine. 

The  army  is  not  immune  to  this  dependency.  Far  from  it.  It  would  be  a  pleasant  surprise  to 
learn  that  fuel  consumption  was  a  major  consideration  in  the  design  and  development  of  the  next 
generation  tank  or  helicopter. 

As  a  short-term  national  solution,  stockpiling  of  petroleum  will  continue  or  even  increase. 
Although  leadership  in  this  area  is  sorely  needed,  no  forceful  initiatives  are  expected  to  emerge  from  the 
White  House  or  Congress  equal  to  the  challenge  of  reducing  import  dependency.  Instead,  communities 
at  the  state  and  local  level  will  perforce  expand  conservation  and  recycling  to  cut  costs  for  fuel  and  power 
and  waste  disposal.  Federal  agencies  will  then  follow  suit. 

As  a  result  of  declining  ore  grades  and  aging  U.S.  production  facilities,  import  dependency  for 
many  nonfuel  minerals  will  proceed  apace.  Because  many  critical  materials  and  minerals  originate  in 
potentially  unstable  countries,  namely  the  "High  Africa"2  countries  and  the  Soviet  Union,  the  National 
Defense  Stockpile  and  attendant  legislation  will  continue  to  play  a  key  role  in  guarding  against  disruptions 
that  might  emerge  there.  Less  likely  and  less  desirable  would  be  troop  deployments  in  southern  Africa 
in  support  of  friendly  regimes  and  suppliers  of  critical  resources. 

Again,  a  substantial  potential  reserve  of  critical  materials  exists  and  can  be  exploited  if  recycling 
and  ingenuity  is  applied  to  the  metal-working  and  scrap  metal  industries.  American  products  by  design 
are  often  excessively  entrophic,  that  is,  they  meld  too  many  intermixed  virgin  commodities  to  make 
recycling  practical  or  economical.  In  the  forecast  period,  it  may  become  more  profitable  to  recover 
minerals  from  discarded  materials  rather  than  produce  them  from  scratch. 


^e  countries  of  "High  Africa"  are  the  mineral-rich  southern  African  nations  of  Gabon,  Zaire, 
Tanzania,  Angola,  Zambia,  Malawi,  Namibia,  Botswana,  Zimbabwe,  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  and 
Mozambique.  These  countries  contain  over  40  major  mineral  districts. 


105 


Finally,  traditional  solutions  are  expected  to  be  employed  to  resolve  U.S.  resource-associated 
problems  in  the  forecast  period:  stockpiling  of  fuel  and  critical  minerals;  substitution  of  one  mineral  for 
another  (silcon  in  optic  fibers  for  copper  cable);  technological  breakthroughs  on  the  margins  to  extend 
gas  mileage  or  replace  one  fuel  with  another;  and  when  all  else  fails  the  planning  and  execution  of 
operations  such  as  DESERT  STORM. 

Unlikely  but  plausible  is  another  approach,  a  Jules  Verne  scenario,  in  which  truly  revolutionary 
developments  emerge  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  major  trends  identified  here  with  respect  to  resource 
problems.  In  this  situation,  by  2015  not  only  should  American  weapons  be  "smarter. "  American  houses, 
cars  and  commerical  buildings  may  only  remotely  resemble  the  dumb  objects  of  today.  Instead,  an 
Edison-in-the-making  will  find  a  way  to  transform  them  into  environmentally  benign,  thrifty  consumers 
of  energy.  Some  houses  and  buildings  may  actually  export  power  to  their  neighbors. 

With  computers  and  electronics,  the  new  infrastructure  of  the  United  States,  when  it  is  built,  will 
interact  with  those  it  serves.  The  roadbeds  may  be  giant  solar  collectors  that  impart  power  to  vehicles 
running  on  or  above  the  surface  of  the  highway.  Roads  with  a  surplus  of  sunshine  might  transmit 
electricity  to  roads  in  shaded  regions.  Ways  might  be  found  to  harness  and  store  for  later  use  the  power 
of  atmospheric  electrical  charges.  And  the  oceans  covering  most  of  the  globe  ultimately  promise  to  yield 
a  wealth  of  minerals,  energy  and  fresh  water. 

At  the  end  of  all  the  research  and  analysis  there  is  one  certainty.  After  studying  more  than  100 
different  minerals  and  resources,  a  single  resource  can  be  identified  as  the  most  critical,  most  strategic 
material  for  the  United  States  and  the  U.S.  Army  in  the  coming  decades.  More  precious  than  gold, 
keener  than  a  diamond,  with  no  known  substitute,  the  human  brain,  roughly  three  pounds  of  bundled 
fibers  per  issue,  holds  within  it  most  if  not  all  the  answers  to  the  questions  this  study  has  raised.  Happily 
for  the  United  States,  no  shortages  of  this  resource  are  anticipated  in  the  forecast  period.  In  2015  the 
U.S.  will  have  about  900  million  pounds  of  grey  matter  in  circulation.  Just  how  resourcefully  and 
creatively  the  nation  will  use  this  critical  material  is  the  subject  of  the  next  study.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 
AMERICAN  EDUCATION 


—  Substantial  reform  of  the  education  system  is  required  to  remain  competitive.  Reports  of 
graduating  functional  illiterates  and  stagnating  achievement  levels  have  delivered  a  grim  message  to  the 
public. 

—  Public  education  will  become  a  reflection  of  the  increasing  ethnic  minority  population.  These 
minorities  are  traditionally  considered  at-risk:  at  greater  risk  of  failing  to  achieve,  of  dropping  out,  of 
not  being  productive  members  of  the  labor  force. 

—  Demands  on  public  education  will  continue  to  change,  reflecting  changes  in  American  family 
structure.  Social  services,  such  as  health  care,  family  planning,  day  care,  and  drug  counseling,  once  the 
domain  of  families,  will  increasingly  become  a  part  of  the  educational  environment. 

—  The  federal  government  will  contribute  enthusiasm  and  vocal  support,  but  the  financial  base 
will  continue  to  rest  with  state  and  local  governments. 

-  Reforms  in  education  are  influenced  by  demographics,  multiculturalism,  contending 
bureaucracies,  and  new  technologies.  Reform  proposals  will  include  choice,  decentralization  of  schools, 
national  curriculum,  national  standards  and  tests,  and  performance-based  assessments.  Domestic  political 
pressures,  contending  interest  groups,  and  public  opinion  will  challenge  the  reforms. 

-  Corporate  investment  and  apprenticeship  programs  will  be  seen  in  isolated  areas.  The  cost 
of  major  reform  will  be  too  significant  for  the  business  world  to  bear. 

—  Major  changes  in  public  education  will  not  occur  until  the  American  public  believes  its  future 
to  be  seriously  threatened.  Until  that  time,  the  hard  political  decisions  will  not  be  made. 

—  The  Army  will  not  have  a  manpower  pool  equipped  to  be  better  cognitive  thinkers  and 
problem-solvers,  hence  more  intensive  training  procedures  will  need  to  be  implemented.

AMERICAN  EDUCATION  IN  2015 


OVERVIEW 

"Education  has  consequences  for  the  quality  and  equality  of  political  and  economic  life  that  extend 
far  beyond  the  individual  student  or  the  student’s  family."  [1] 

Malaise  has  settled  into  the  education  system  of  the  United  States.  United  States  students  measure 
poorly  in  international  comparisons  of  educational  achievement.  One  of  the  consequences  is  that  the 
United  States  has  lost  its  competitiveness  in  the  international  economic  arena.  Changes  in  education  are 
initiated  in  fits  and  starts,  are  incremental  and  slow,  and  by  2015,  the  necessary  overhaul  of  the  system 
will  likely  remain  incomplete.  It  will  take  longer  to  see  results.  Reforms  are  challenged  by  domestic 
political  pressures,  contending  interest  groups,  public  opinion,  and  legal  considerations. 

One  of  the  problems  facing  education  reform  is  the  size  of  the  education  bureaucracy.  In  fact, 
various  bureaucracies-state  and  national  legislatures,  governors,  school  boards,  chief  state  school 
officers,  higher  educational  institutions,  teachers’  unions,  and  foundations,  influence  education  reforms 
either  by  advocating  and  promoting  (some  of)  them,  and/or  impeding  the  changes.  As  state  and  local 
shares  of  school  budgets  have  increased  over  the  last  few  decades,  so  too  have  the  number  of  state  and 
local  regulations.  Federal  regulations  also  have  proliferated--most  relating  to  increased  federal  grant 
programs. 

Demographic  factors  are  a  driver  of  change  in  education  policy  and  programs.  As  minority 
populations  increase  to  approximately  two-thirds  of  public  school  enrollment  by  2015,  the  politics  of  race 
versus  multiculturalism  will  also  become  an  issue  in  the  debate  over  systemic  reforms.  According  to  its 
advocates,  multicultural  education  (multiculturalism,  which  its  critics  distinguish  from  cultural  pluralism) 
seeks  to  enrich  students’  knowledge  of  history  and  an  appreciation  of  American  diversity,  with  an 
understanding  that  we  are  one  nation  with  a  common  set  of  political  and  moral  values.  The  current  focus 
of  the  multicultural  debate  challenges  the  Eurocentric  focus  of  education  (centered  on  the  United  States 
and  the  West,  in  terms  of  the  social  history  of  America),  and  seeks  to  incorporate  Affocentricism,  a 
"particularistic"  approach.  As  American  society  becomes  more  diverse,  a  more  "pluralistic"  approach 
will  need  to  be  considered. 

According  to  Pallas,  Natriello,  and  McDill,  the  single  most  important  factor  in  the  school-age 
population  of  the  future  is  the  expected  increase  in  both  the  number  and  proportion  of  traditionally 
disadvantaged  young  people.  They  identify  five  key  indicators  associated  with  educationally 
disadvantaged  youth  which  correlate  with  poor  performance  in  school:  minority  racial/ethnic  group 
identity,  living  in  a  poverty  household,  living  in  a  single-parent  family,  having  a  poorly  educated  mother 
(usually  the  head  of  the  household),  and  having  a  non-English  language  background. 

Children  from  disadvantaged  backgrounds  leave  formal  schooling  with  fewer  cognitive  skills  and 


110 


lower  levels  of  cultural  literacy  than  their  more  prosperous  counterparts.  Noncollege  youth  have  been 
consistently  overlooked  and  undertrained.  Some  of  these  youth  enter  military  service,  which  can  provide 
job  training,  experience,  and  time  to  mature. 

Although  a  uniform  and  accurate  counting  system  for  student  dropouts  does  not  exist,  the  fact 
remains  that  disadvantaged  students  are  at  a  greater  risk  of  dropping  out.  Minority  students  are  more 
likely  to  be  behind  their  modal  grade  (and  subsequently  drop  out)  than  white  students.  In  many  large 
cities,  where  public  education  is  dominated  by  minority  populations,  disadvantaged  youth  account  for  a 
large  proportion  of  the  dropout  rate.  Students  in  certain  parts  of  the  country  are  also  at  a  greater  risk 
of  dropping  out.  The  most  common  reason  for  dropping  out  is  poor  academic  performance. 

Education  reform  in  the  late  1980s  was  directed  at:  designing  education  for  the  21st  century, 
organizing  a  system  of  lifelong  learning,  enriching  and  diversifying  elementary  and  secondary  education, 
improving  and  diversifying  higher  education,  improving  the  quality  of  teachers,  adapting  to 
internationalization  and  the  information  age,  and  conducting  a  review  of  educational  administration  and 
finance.  Education  reforms  address  different  concerns  in  rural  areas.  Many  rural  districts  are 
disadvantaged  because  they  have  fewer  resources-as  a  result  of  lower  tax  bases  and  a  greater  difficulty 
in  recruiting  and  retraining  teachers.  Rural  schools  often  lack  a  large  enough  student  base  to  support 
diverse  program  offerings— including  a  limited  ability  to  provide  vocational  programs.  Where 
instructional  staff  is  lacking,  technology  will  fill  in  the  gaps.  Rural  schoolchildren  will  also  be  expected 
to  adhere  to  a  national  curriculum,  take  national  examinations,  and  meet  national  standards. 
Multiculturalism  will  not  be  an  issue. 

New  technologies  will  render  many  careers  obsolete  by  2015.  Our  high  schools  turn  out 
semiliterate  young  adults  ill-equipped  to  deal  with  the  technological  world,  frustrating  the  needs  of  the 
work  force  for  better-prepared  employees.  The  continuing  shift  from  manufacturing  to  service  industries 
will  result  in  many  jobs  demanding  high  levels  of  technical  knowledge  and  skill,  and  most  will  require 
well-developed  social  skills.  The  jobs  that  employ  the  greatest  number  of  people  will  not  require  more 
than  a  high  school  education,  and  often  less.  Three  types  of  skills  traditionally  not  required  of  lower- 
level  jobs  are  becoming  more  critical:  a  higher  level  of  cognition  and  problem-solving;  flexibility¬ 
knowing  how  to  perform  a  variety  of  tasks;  and  teamwork-including  the  capacity  to  resolve  conflicts. 
Business  and  military  leaders  complain  that  they  must  spend  millions  of  dollars  on  remedial  education 
and  training  programs  in  such  basic  skills  as  reading,  writing,  spelling,  and  computations.  In  the  future, 
the  question  of  a  course  of  study  may  be  tied  to  a  minimum  outcome  level,  not  a  fixed  number  of  years, 
and  high  school  graduates  will  need  more  than  good  performance  records  on  standardized  tests. 

Most  students  realize  few  benefits  from  working  hard  while  in  school  since  the  labor  market  in 
the  United  States,  unlike  other  industrialized  countries,  does  not  reward  effort  and  achievement  in  high 
school.  (This  may  have  some  effect  on  the  decline  in  test  scores  since  students  have  little  incentive  to 
do  well.)  High  school  graduates  in  Canada,  Japan,  and  Europe  compete  for  attractive  jobs  on  the  basis 
of  knowledge  and  skills  gained  in  high  school.  Achievement  tests  are  closely  tied  to  the  curriculum. 
Performance  on  these  tests  is  the  primary  determinant  of  university  admission,  and  to  a  particular  field 


111 


of  study.  Job  applications  at  all  levels  require  information  about  examination  grades.  These  national 
examinations  are  yardsticks  by  which  achievement  is  measured  in  terms  relative  to  everyone  else’s  in  the 
nation.  Mathematics  and  science  achievement  are  regarded  as  especially  important.  In  Germany,  high 
school  grades  are  the  major  determinant  of  who  gets  the  most  preferred  apprenticeships. 

Parents  in  the  United  States  hold  their  children  and  schools  to  a  lower  standard  than  do  Japanese, 
Taiwanese,  and  European  parents.  Students  in  the  United  States  spend  less  time  receiving  instruction, 
studying,  and  doing  homework,  and  more  time  watching  television,  than  do  students  in  other 
industrialized  nations. 

The  distinction  between  national  and  federal  will  continue.  The  move  towards  a  national 
curriculum,  national  performance  standards  and  assessments,  national  achievements,  and  national  teacher 
certification  will  be  distinguished  from  federal  intervention.  The  major  responsibility  of  the  federal 
government  will  be  in  legislative  and  judicial  matters  and  as  a  cheerleader  and  bully  pulpit  in  influencing 
the  conduct  of  education.  National  goals  (a  federal  mandate)  will  continue  to  be  established  in  order  to 
keep  the  United  States  from  falling  further  behind  in  the  international  arena.  The  federal  government  will 
target  pilot  programs,  initiatives,  and  assistance  for  handicapped,  disadvantaged,  and  at-risk  youth.  State 
and  local  funding  will  continue  to  predominate  in  operations  (program). 

David  T.  Kearns,  CEO  of  Xerox  (and  Deputy  Secretary  of  Education  designate),  has  called  for 
the  complete  restructuring  of  public  education  in  the  United  States.  Kearns  believes  that  since  education 
interests  have  failed  to  improve  the  school  system,  it  is  up  to  the  business  community,  which  understands 
competition  and  market  discipline,  to  set  the  new  agenda. 

Kearns  advocates  improving  schools  by  hiring  better  teachers  and  paying  them  more, 
strengthening  the  curriculum,  improving  tests  and  measures,  and  expecting  more  of  students.  It  is 
imperative  that  school  districts  confront  the  realities  of  the  twenty-first  century— and  rid  themselves  of 
nineteenth-century  organizational  bureaucracies-by  emulating  successful  companies  that  are  decentralized, 
relying  on  the  know-how  and  professionalism  of  workers  close  to  the  problem,  being  flexible,  and 
spending  heavily  on  employee  education,  training,  and  investment  in  research. 

As  a  result  of  The  National  Commission  on  Excellence  in  Education  report,  A  Nation  at  Risk: 
The  Imperative  for  Educational  Reform  (1983),  there  have  been  some  modest  advances  on  the  education 
front.  The  minimum  requirements  for  graduation  from  high  school  have  been  raised  in  almost  all  states. 
The  states  that  lengthened  the  school  day  have  witnessed  an  increase  in  test  scores— a  questionable 
criterion  of  success  when  25  percent  of  high  school  graduates  remain  functionally  illiterate.  Mathematics 
and  science  curricula  have  received  more  attention  and  have  enrolled  more  students.  These  reforms  raise 
new  areas  of  concern--for  example,  how  do  additional  requirements  serve  the  needs  of  disadvantaged 
students? 

Over  the  last  few  decades,  federal  spending  on  education  has  declined  (taking  into  account 
inflation),  while  state  and  local  expenditures  have  increased.  The  primary  provider  of  education  revenues 
is  local  government.  Improvements  in  the  education  system  cost  money:  a  longer  school  day/year, 
increased  graduation  requirements,  significantly  reduced  class  size  (a  primary  influence  on  achievement), 


112 


a  better  evaluation  system,  more  staff  development,  and  technological  assistance. 

Spending  more  money,  however,  is  not  enough;  the  public  education  system  must  be  overhauled. 
In  particular,  the  federal  government  must  be  in  the  vanguard  of  funding  and  developing  national 
assessments  that  are  performance-based.  In  fiscal  1990,  only  a  small  proportion  of  the  education  budget 
(approximately  $100  million  of  about  $24  billion)  was  spent  on  promoting  accountability  for  school 
performance.  Currently,  the  federal  government  does  not  make  its  support  contingent  on  performance  or 
state  and  local  innovations;  choice  aims  to  make  schools  accountable. 


THE  SCHOOL  OF  THE  FUTURE 

Choice 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  issue  of  school  choice  came  into  focus.  Supported  by  the  presidency  and 
Department  of  Education,  choice  involves  legal,  political,  economic,  and  educational  issues.  Choice  is 
a  market-oriented  reform-parents  and  students  can  choose  which  educational  "market"  they  want  to 
attend— that  relies  on  school-based  management  (decentralization)  to  hold  schools  accountable  for  their 
own  performance.  School  choice  issues  include:  public  or  private  schools,  vouchers  or  tuition  tax 
credits,  interdistrict  and  intradistrict  choice,  magnet  schools,  post-secondary  options,  second-chance 
programs,  and  home  schooling. 

Choice  advocates  say  that  market  control  will  reduce  the  constraining  education  bureaucracy 
(already  cited  as  a  burden  to  improved  performance),  make  the  relationship  between  schools  and 
democratic  authorities  much  less  prone  to  excessive  regulation  and  inadequate  accountability,  and  result 
in  closer  and  more  cooperative  relationships  among  schools,  students,  and  parents.  All  these 
developments  will  promote  (and  hopefully  raise)  student  achievement.  A  school  either  improves  or  goes 
out  of  business.  As  a  method  of  improving  public  education-via  competition  for  students  and  the 
empowerment  of  parents  by  involving  them  more  in  their  children’s  education-choice  has  received 
political  and  popular  support,  academic  and  media  approval. 

Public  school  choice  is  an  issue  for  state  legislatures,  and  by  1990,  was  on  the  legislative  agenda 
of  half  the  states.  Advocates  say  that  public  school  choice  does  not  require  large-scale  federal 
appropriations.  According  to  Lorraine  McDonnell,  however,  magnet  schools  are  10  to  12  percent  more 
expensive  to  run  than  traditional  schools;  some  specialty  schools  are  even  more  costly  to  operate.  And, 
funding  for  transportation  may  be  required  at  the  state  level. 

Choice  advocates  view  public  school  choice  as  an  equalizer-a  means  to  foster  racial  integration- 
though  critics  fear  resegregation.  Disadvantaged  minorities  generally  do  not  transfer  from  inner  city  to 
suburban  schools.  Some  choice  plans  have  judicial  restrictions-choice  is  not  an  option  where  it  tends 
to  segregate  and  discriminate  against  populations. 

Advocates  also  argue  that  different  children  perform  better  in  different  learning  environments-and 


113 


that  one  should  be  able  to  choose  that  which  best  meet  one’s  needs.  Often,  however,  choice  does  not 
involve  specific  educational  programs  or  achievement  records,  but  rather  services --whether  a  school  offers 
day  care  or  a  strong  athletic  program.  Choice  is  also  more  likely  to  be  exercised  in  heavily  populated 
areas  with  greater  access  to  public  transportation. 

Choice  advocates  Kearns  and  Doyle  propose  that  all  public  school  districts  with  more  than  2,500 
students  reorganize  into  voluntary  year-round  magnet  systems  that  would  offer  open  enrollment  around 
academic  or  vocational  specialties.  Year-round  schools  will  allow  for  maximum  coordination  between 
work  and  school,  and  strengthen  the  ties  between  the  business  and  education  communities.  Participating 
schools  will  have  incentives,  entrepreneurship,  unit-level  accountability,  and  consumer  responsiveness 
reminiscent  of  the  private  sector,  but  with  universal  access,  minimum  outcome  standards,  performance 
tracking,  and  the  fiscal  arrangements  of  a  lightly  regulated  public  sector  enterprise.  The  state  would 
prescribe  minimum  standards  and  ensure  that  all  students  are  placed. 

Former  Department  of  Education  Assistant  Secretary  for  Research  and  Improvement,  Chester 
Finn,  has  said  that  under  the  system  of  choice,  the  distinction  between  "public"  and  "private"  will  blur. 
Voucher  plans,  under  which  states  allow  the  use  of  tax  revenues  to  pay  for  education  in  public,  private, 
and  parochial  schools  will  facilitiate  this  "blurring".  This  will  be  a  contentious  political  issue  with  regard 
to  the  constitutionality  of  the  separation  of  church  and  state.  It  is  also  unlikely  that  lower  income  families 
will  be  able  to  afford  private  schools  even  with  vouchers. 

Critics  are  also  concerned  about  the  quality  of  information  and  whether  adequate  information 
about  programs,  personnel,  and  performance  would  be  forthcoming  so  that  parents  could  make  informed 
choices  about  schools  (well-educated  and  middle  and  upper  class  parents  are  more  likely  to  make  better 
choices  than  the  economically  disadvantaged).  Critics  also  fear  that  some  education  markets  might 
support  too  few  competitors  to  realize  market  advantages.  Further,  schools  might  not  select  economically 
disadvantaged  students-they  cost  more  to  educate  and  financial  resources  are  not  necessarily  equal. 

If  choice  is  not  exercised  to  a  significant  degree  in  states  where  it  is  an  option,  it  is  unlikely  that 
choice  will  continue  to  be  pursued  at  the  federal  level.  By  2015,  choice  advocacy  will  be  limited  by  a 
(likely)  lack  of  the  exercise  of  choice  and  its  added  costs.  If,  however,  a  significant  level  of  choice  is 
exercised,  and,  as  a  result,  achievement  levels  raised  and  better  societal  integration  evidenced  as  a 
byproduct  of  that  option,  it  is  likely  that  choice  will  become  a  nationally  legislated  norm.  Better  school 
accountability  and  performance  as  a  byproduct  of  choice,  resulting  in  a  more  functionally  literate  and 
"smarter"  student  body,  will  have  a  positive  impact.  Success  in  raising  achievement  levels  as  a  result 
of  public  school  choice  may  likely  influence  the  adoption  of  choice  plans  that  apply  to  private  schools. 
Decentralization  may  be  a  lasting  result  of  reform  efforts  even  if  choice  does  not  succeed. 

Decentralization 


In  the  1960s,  the  education  system  was  central ized-run  top-down  from  school  superintendents, 
to  principals,  to  teachers.  In  the  1990s,  education  reformers  advocated  decentralization. 


114 


Decentralization  and  deregulation,  that  is,  school-based  management,  is  both  an  integral  part  of  public 
school  choice  plans  and  a  separate  reform  issue. 

Kearns  envisions  central  school  district  offices  as  service  centers,  not  command  posts,  and  school 
principals  as  the  most  important  and  most  vital  link  in  the  "education  chain  of  cause  and  effect."  The 
central  administration  receives  funds-to  be  spent  by  the  principal  and  staff.  The  principal  is  the  CEO. 

Under  this  scheme,  schools  recruit,  retain,  and  remove  staff.  Schools  are  also  responsible  for  resource 
allocation,  scheduling,  and  instructional  organization.  By  disbanding  the  mid-level  offices  between  the 
central  school  district  office  and  the  school  itself  where  functions  are  often  duplicated,  decentralization 
puts  resources  back  into  the  schools  where  staff  decisions,  not  a  system-wide  formula,  directs  spending. 
Teachers  and  principals  would  decide  on  the  amount  of  overhead  (services  offered  by  central  offices  but 
purchased  on  an  as-needed  basis  by  the  schools)—in  areas  such  as  textbook  acquisition,  library  services, 
and  counseling.  Along  with  eliminating  bureaucratic  intermediaries,  decentralization  envisions 
introducing  modern  management  concepts,  thereby  promoting  accountability  and,  in  turn,  improvement. 
Decentralization  will  proliferate  by  the  turn  of  the  century. 

If,  as  intended,  decentralization  succeeds  either  as  a  cost-saving  measure  and/or  impetus  for 
improvement,  (some  parts  of)  the  educational  bureaucracy  will  be  streamlined  and  school-based 
management  will  become  institutionalized.  If  savings  are  inconsequential  and  educational  achievement 
fails  to  improve,  centralization  will  resume. 

Curriculum 


The  back-to-the-basics  movement  will  be  altered.  The  label  applied  to  the  "3Rs"  approach  is  too 
limiting.  A  national  curriculum  framework  with  regional  variations,  driven  by  more  rigid  mathematics 
and  science  requirements  (and  more  courses  in  these  subjects),  and  the  need  to  instill  higher-order 
thinking  skills  (in  order  to  raise  international  competitiveness),  will  lead  to  more  rigid,  mandated  high 
school  graduation  requirements,  and  will  be  instituted  by  2015.  (Japan  and  most  European  nations  have 
national  curricula,  See  Appendix  A.)  Many  states  already  have  legislated  stricter  academic  requirements 
(particularly  in  mathematics  and  science)  for  high  school  graduation,  resulting  in  changes  in  curriculum 
guidelines.  Lack  of  improvement  in  international  achievement  comparisons  will  accelerate  the  move 
towards  a  national  curriculum. 

The  extent  of  curriculum  specificity  (which  can  be  detailed  by  outcomes--not  weekly  guidelines) 
and  the  quality  and  variety  of  curriculum  materials  are  also  parts  of  curriculum  reform.  Other  curriculum 
changes  will  address  access  to  information,  thinking  clearly,  communicating  effectively,  understanding 
the  environment,  man  and  society,  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  people  in  a  global  society,  and 
personal  competence. 

Interdisciplinary  courses,  to  include  computers  and  other  information  technologies,  will  become  an 
integral  part  of  secondary  education. 

The  curriculum  reform  debate  also  drives  other  issues-the  role  of  national  examinations  (and  the 


115 


need  to  first  devise  adequate  assessments  and  standards),  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  teacher 
preparation,  pressure  for  cultural  literacy  (multicultural ism),  and  school  restructuring  (school-based 
management  and  choice).  Testing  and  accountability,  according  to  Linda  M.  McNeil,  produce  a  "de  facto 
national  curriculum  that  is  driven  by  supposedly  scientific  and  neutral  objectives  conducive  to 
computerized  scoring-a  curriculum  that  is  not  subject  to  political  scrutiny.  "[38]  Cultural  literacy  debates 
are  largely  academic.  School  restructuring  implies  that  if  current  school  structures  inhibit  or  distort 
curriculum,  curriculum  can  be  improved  by  reshaping  the  structures. 

Kearns  and  Doyle  suggest  that  a  core  curriculum,  at  least  through  age  16  (grade  10),  but 
preferably  until  age  18  (grade  12),  be  adopted,  and  that  promotion  to  a  higher  grade  not  be  granted 
without  certification  of  performance.  Certification  can  be  handled  through  examination,  in  the  same  way 
students  take  advanced  placement  examinations  in  high  school  to  gain  college  credit.  Kearns  and  Doyle 
also  advocate  the  "flexible  term  equivalent" --performance  organized  around  accomplishment  of  the 
curriculum,  not  units  of  time.  This  would  also  result  in  a  move  away  from  machine  scorable  tests  (the 
SAT  and  ACT),  which  are  advantageous  to  the  middle  class  and  disadvantageous  (that  is  discriminatory) 
to  at-risk  and  minority  students.  These  tests  also  neglect  the  oral  and  written  form. 

A  national  curriculum  core,  even  one  with  regional  variations,  will  present  advantaged  and 
disadvantaged  students  with  the  same  framework.  Such  a  curriculum  and  its  byproducts  (for  example, 
teachers  and  students  held  to  common  sets  of  expectations,  improved  teacher  training  and  materials 
development)  made  available  to  all  groups  on  an  equal  basis,  without  requiring  localities  to  make  vast 
investments  of  money  and  time,  might  help  to  minimize  the  gaps  between  the  various  education 
constituencies  and  promote  educational  equity.  (However,  objections  to  these  measures  are  the  same  as 
those  used  to  point  out  the  discriminatory  nature  of  national  tests.)  The  previous  trend  towards  basic 
skills  education,  as  the  best  way  to  pursue  educational  equity,  has  helped  to  narrow  the  achievement  gap 
between  black  and  low  income  children  (versus  white  and  higher  income  youth),  but  has  produced 
students  lacking  a  rich  knowledge  base  and  higher-order  skills. 

National  Tests 

National  tests-standards,  that  is  performance-based  assessments-are  critical  to  education  reform. 
Driven  by  the  national  curriculum  framework  and  stricter  high  school  graduation  requirements,  they  will 
be  developed  gradually,  and  may  be  in  place  by  2015.  Unless  these  tests  are  developed  as  performance- 
based  assessments,  in  tandem  with  systemic  educational  reform,  they  will  neither  measure  for 
accountability,  nor  have  teachers  do  anything  but  "teach  for  the  test."  Consequently,  a  movement  to 
change  the  nature  of  assessments-that  is,  to  measure  higher-order  skills,  has  developed.  These  tests  will 
not  be  today’s  computerized  multiple  choice  questions,  which  stress  lower-level  skills  heavily  dependent 
on  memorization,  teaching  to  the  test,  and  discriminate  against  minority  populations. 

National  assessments  should  be  consistent  with  the  reorientation  of  learning  skills  and 
accountability  goals,  measure  competency,  be  based  on  proficiency,  have  well-designed  remedial 


116 


programs  (to  assist  those  in  reaching  national  standards),  and  be  capable  of  monitoring  instruction  and 
learning  with  the  periodic  testing  of  general  achievement  and  specific  skills.  They  should  measure  not 
only  qualitative  standards  in  mathematics,  science,  and  English  language  skills,  but  also  proficiency  in 
problem-solving,  reasoning,  and  creativity.  Those  who  believe  that  a  well -conceived  national  test  can 
be  an  important  lever  for  upgrading  what  is  taught  and  learned  in  school  see  the  lack  of  such  a  test  in  the 
United  States  as  a  source  of  frustration.  If  minority  students  do  poorly  on  this  national  test,  however, 
there  may  be  considerable  political  pressure  to  drop  it  as  well. 

The  President’s  Advisory  Committee  on  Education  is  considering  the  appropriateness  and 
feasibility  of  a  national  test  administered  to  all  students  at  two  or  three  grade  levels.  (Most  industrialized 
countries  have  a  national  curriculum  and  national  examinations  that  are  given  to  almost  all  students  at 
some  time).  One  version  of  the  test  would  have  it  normed  to  international  standards--poor  performance 
of  U.S.  students  vis-a-vis  their  international  counterparts  would  trigger  greater  public  interest  in  education 
reforms.  Another  proposal  would  base  test  content  on  explicated  syllabi  and  make  the  test  an  important 
influence  in  students’  lives  by  making  results  available  to  college  admissions  officers,  or  future 
employers.  Increased  motivation  and  better  behavior  may  be  a  byproduct,  if  the  sharing  of  results  makes 
students  more  serious  about  their  studies.  Alternatively  it  could  lead  to  even  more  damaging 
discrimination  against  minority  students,  stigmatizing  them,  and  shutting  them  out  of  college  or  the 
workplace. 

If  national  examinations  are  tied  into  an  accountability  system,  they  might  also  provide  a  means 
for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  particular  schools--and  for  rewarding  them.  This  would  motivate 
teachers  and  administrators  to  find  the  best  ways  to  teach  the  national  curriculum.  It  might  also  support 
the  choice  argument-schools  that  perform  well  on  the  tests  will  perform  well  in  the  "market."  National 
tests  must  show  achievement  gaps  and  push  the  federal  government  to  provide  additional  resources  to  the 
schools  most  needing  help  to  reach  national  standards.  However,  the  decline  in  national  test  scores  may 
also  lead  to  a  diminishing  focus  on  those  who  perform  well.  Some  critics  cite  the  establishment 

of  a  national  test  as  leading  to  the  imposition  of  a  national  curriculum  without  discussion.  This  may 
increase  lobbying  against  both  standards  and  curriculum  and  delay  reform  efforts.  Others  point  out  that 
although  a  national  curriculum  core  is  reasonable  and  appropriate,  standardized  tests  measure  stability, 
not  variability  (achievement  levels  of  large  groups  of  students  for  whom  there  are  common  expectations), 
and  discriminate  against  special  needs  populations. 

Changes  in  the  National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress  (NAEP),  which  provides  periodic 
assessments  of  students  in  a  number  of  subjects,  using  national  samples  of  students  from  three  age/grade 
levels,  have  influenced  the  trend  towards  developing  a  national  curriculum.  These  data  are  the  only 
consistent  national  achievement  measurement  in  the  United  States.  Until  1990,  NAEP  reported  national 
grades  only.  In  1991,  for  the  first  time,  the  NAEP  will  report  findings  on  a  state-by-state  basis  on  an 
eighth  grade  mathematics  assessment.  State  participation  is  voluntary,  however.  This  experiment, 
permitted  by  a  new  federal  law,  will  probably  expand  in  1992,  when  fourth  and  eighth  grade  mathematics 
will  be  assessed-again,  in  as  many  states  as  wish  to  participate.  Assessment  results  could  increase 


117 


pressure  on  state  policymakers  to  bring  state  curricula  in  line  with  NAEP  frameworks.  NAEP 
comparisons  reflect  performance  of  a  much  more  representative  sample  of  state’s  students  than  do  SAT 
and  ACT  scores,  which  measure  college  bound  students,  are  administered  late  in  secondary  school,  and 
are  insensitive  to  the  school  curriculum. 

Achievement  Levels 

The  level  of  U.S.  students  in  achievement  tests  of  international  comparison  (the  United  States  is 
low  relative  to  other  industrialized  nations)  may  show  some  improvement  by  2015.  Achievement  levels 
have  shown  little  gain  in  the  past  decade,  and  at  the  current  rate  of  achievement,  the  United  States  has 
much  to  do  in  order  to  catch  up.  Again,  a  fundamental  overhaul  of  the  education  system  is  needed  prior 
to  realizing  positive  results  and  large  gains  in  achievement  scores. 

John  H.  Bishop,  of  the  Department  of  Personnel  and  Human  Resource  Studies,  New  York  State 
School  of  Industrial  and  Labor  Relations,  Cornell  University,  posits  that  the  large  and  historically 
unprecedented  test  score  decline  between  1967  and  1980  negatively  affected  the  quality  of  the  work  force 
and  the  GNP.  This  decline  was  across  the  board-for  whites  and  minorities,  public  and  private  schools. 
Declines  were  greater  for  higher-level  skills  (inference  and  problem  solving)  than  for  the  basic  skills 
(arithmetic  computation).  There  was  no  visible  decline  in  the  first  few  years  of  elementary  school, 
although  the  advantage  of  being  better  prepared  for  first  grade  than  were  earlier  generations  lasted  only 
through  the  third  grade.  Since  a  decline  affects  a  work  force  over  a  period  of  some  50  years,  these 
shortfalls  are  enduring. 

Bishop  points  out  that  recent  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  and  rigor  of  the  curriculum  have  led 
to  rising  test  scores.  However,  the  general  intellectual  achievement  level  (GIA)  of  high  school  seniors 
has  remained  substantially  below  the  level  that  would  have  been  reached  if  the  rate  of  gain  of  academic 
achievement  of  the  1940s  through  the  early  1960s  had  continued,  rather  than  reversed  beginning  in  1967. 
Bishop  sees  a  parallel  decline  in  academic  achievement  in  the  applicants  to  graduate  and  professional 
schools  between  1966  and  1980,  as  well  as  a  similar  recent  rebound  in  test  scores.  Bishop  notes  that  even 
if  current  efforts  to  improve  education  succeed,  the  earlier  period  of  low  test  scores  will  continue  to 
depress  productivity  well  into  the  21st  century  because  of  the  growth  of  the  labor  quality  shortfall.  He 
suggests  that  the  only  way  to  prevent  these  forecasts  from  coming  to  fruition  is  to  change  the  relationship 
between  the  GIA  at  age  17  and  the  GIA  as  an  adult.  This  will  be  done  by  luring  massive  numbers  of 
adults  back  into  school,  expanding  educational  offerings  on  television,  and/or  inducing  employers  to 
provide  general  education  to  long-term  employees. 

National  Teacher  Certification 


National  teacher  certification  will  come  about  more  slowly  than  the  movement  towards  a  national 

curriculum  framework  and  national  assessments.  A  natural  offshoot  of  these  developments,  teacher 


118 


certification  (licensing)  should  test  both  for  basic  skills  competency  and  area  expertise. 

A  national  curriculum  framework  would  help  to  structure  a  common  knowledge  base  for  teachers. 
However,  a  vast  investment  in  professional  teacher  development  is  needed  if  the  benefits  of  a  national 
curriculum  are  to  be  realized.  The  necessity  of  bringing  pre-service  education  in  line  with  the  curriculum 
requires  great  changes  in  the  curricula  of  teacher-training  institutions  and  licensing  requirements. 
Licensing  examinations  and  inservice  programs  probably  will  be  based  on  improving  understanding  of 
and  ability  to  teach  national  curriculum  content. 

The  acknowledged  teacher  shortages  in  specific  subject  areas,  however,  will  mitigate  requirements 
where  area  expertise  overrides  the  need  for  certification.  "Alternate  certification,"  a  practice  that  relies 
on  a  person’s  demonstrated  knowledge,  skill,  character,  and  willingness  to  impart  some  of  that  knowledge 
to  children,  allows  adults  to  attain  provisional  status  in  the  education  profession.  It  is  likely  that 
"alternate  certification"  will  increase  and  co-exist  with  demands  for  national  teacher  certification 
standards,  enlarging  the  pool  of  prospective  teachers,  particularly  where  there  are  shortages,  (both  for 
specific  disciplines  and  in  certain  geographic  areas),  as  well  as  equal  opportunity  considerations.  Some 
reform  proponents  even  advocate  that  in  some  subject  areas  instruction  not  be  limited  to  teachers  and  that 
professionals  be  used  instead. 

Teaching  ability  can  be  learned-by  apprenticeship  to  a  master  teacher.  Kearns  and  Doyle 
advocate  eliminating  the  degree  in  education  and  substituting  it  with  a  bachelors  degree  in  a  subject 
matter,  followed  by  a  fifth  year  internship  in  a  school  building,  supervised  by  a  master  teacher. 

Kearns  and  Doyle  believe  new  licensing  standards  should  be  flexible  and  diverse,  based  in  large 
part  on  performance  standards,  and  measured  by  knowledge  of  subject  matter  (although  knowledge  of 
subject  does  not  guarantee  an  effective  teacher).  They  also  believe  licensing  is  a  state  responsibility. 

Teachers’  unions  and  demographic  changes  will  impede  national  certification  on  the  basis  of  equal 
opportunity  and  human  resource  issues.  Some  schools  and/or  states  may  move  towards  intern  and  master 
teacher  certification  programs.  Certification  is  a  contentious  issue  with  teachers’  unions.  Merit  pay 
issues  will  continue  to  be  both  contentious  and  an  issue  of  fiscal  concern. 

As  computers  and  new  technologies  transform  the  classroom,  and  computers  are  combined  with 
team-teaching  and  collaborative  learning,  teachers’  jobs  will  change.  Teachers  will  still  have  a  critical 
role  in  providing  effective  learning  situations  but  will  need  increased  training  and  institutional  support 
to  successfully  teach  with  technology. 

Teacher  retention  will  be  based  on  job  performance.  According  to  the  concept  of  school-based 
management,  principals  will  be  responsible  for  firing  ineffective  teachers.  How,  and  under  whose 
responsibility  they  will  or  will  not  be  retrained  is  another  issue,  not  addressed  here. 

Multiculturalism 


Multicultural  ism  versus  the  politics  of  race,  a  controversial  political  issue,  will  be  influenced  by 
the  changing  demographic  picture.  Although  multiculturalism  pits  the  traditionally  Eurocentric  approach 


119 


to  history  and  society  against  the  Afro-American  ("particularlistic")  experience,  demographics  will  also 
have  an  impact  on  this  issue.  By  2015,  Hispanics  will  represent  a  greater  proportion  of  the  population 
than  will  blacks.  If  Hispanics  are  able  to  wield  political  clout  (similar  to  what  the  blacks  exert  at 
present),  then  the  multicultural  question  becomes  even  more  complicated  in  terms  of  incorporating  the 
Hispanic  experience,  which  itself  is  diverse  (see  "Demography").  At  what  point  does  the  cultural 
diversity  of  "we  are  all  one  nation"  ("pluralistic  experience")  transcend  the  politics  of  race?  The  question 
of  enforcing  and  supporting  educational  equity  and  equal  opportunity  will  be  challenged  by  the  political 
climate  that  emphasizes  excellence  and  elitism.  Further,  multicultural  ism  is  primarily  an  issue  in  large 
urban/suburban  school  districts  that  constitute  the  overwhelming  majority  of  school  enrollment— it  is  not 
an  issue  in  other  communities. 

Tracking 

Tracking,  grouping  by  performance  rather  than  "race  mix,"  will  be  abandoned  in  the  near  term 
since  it  is  claimed  to  be  discriminatory  and  disadvantageous  to  at-risk  youth  and  does  not  fare  much  better 
with  other  parts  of  the  population.  After  the  absence  of  tracking  proves  ineffective  in  improving 
educational  achievement,  tracking  advocates  will  lobby  for  reinstatement,  citing  it  promotes  educational 
achievement  and  tracking  will  be  resumed. 

New  Technologies 

The  traditional  classroom  environment  will  change  as  the  array  of  education  delivery  systems 
expands.  Classrooms  run  by  proprietary  schools  will  remain,  but  developments  in  telecommunications 
will  provide  educators  with  new  options.  Electronic  links  between  distant  locations,  that  is,  "distance 
learning"-the  live  delivery  of  instruction  from  one  distant  site  to  another  via  satellite  with  audio  and/or 
video  interaction  between  students  and  teachers-will  proliferate,  as  will  the  use  of  computers,  satellites, 
fiber  optics,  interactive  television  and  videodiscs,  cable  television,  electronic  bulletin  boards,  and 
electronic  mail.  Closed  circuit  and  cable  tele-courses  will  become  commonplace,  and  videodiscs  and 
videotaped  "telelessons"  will  enhance,  supplement,  and,  in  some  cases  replace  textbooks  and  written 
materials.  Students  will  access,  via  laser  disk  or  telephone,  a  central  learning  center  equipped  with  high¬ 
speed  computers  that  can  communicate  in  any  learning  resource  center  worldwide.  Computers  in  the 
classroom  can  be  used  as  tutors,  or  for  simulation  and  gaming.  The  more  familiar  uses  of  computers  can 
provide  practical  applications  for  instruction.  Tutorial  applications  can  promote  higher  order  thinking 
skills.  Training  will  become  problematic. 

Schools  will  need  to  adopt  these  new  technologies  in  order  to  offer  more  extensive  and  intensive 
curricula.  Steps  must  be  taken  to  ensure  the  effective  use  of  new  technologies  and  learning  theories. 
This  mix  of  technologies  must  also  be  taken  into  account  in  planning  both  curriculum  and  facilities. 

State-mandated  curriculum  changes  (and  eventually  a  national  curriculum  framework)  and  more 


120 


rigid  high  school  graduation  requirements  will  drive  distance  learning.  New  technologies  will  enable 
schools  to  meet  curriculum  requirements,  offer  courses  where  there  are  teacher  shortages,  and  similarly 
provide  inservice  training  that  might  otherwise  be  unavailable.  Telecommunications  networking  is 
particularly  attractive  for  small  and  rural  schools. 

The  proliferation  of  these  rapid  technological  changes  will  likely  be  inhibited  by  lack  of  funding. 
Large  increases  in  federal  funding  will  be  needed  if  the  United  States  moves  to  a  national 
telecommunications  infrastructure  for  distance  learning.  Although  new  technologies  have  made 

systems  increasingly  affordable,  cost  factors  will  influence  the  acquisition  and  spread  of  the  new 
educational  environment.  Long-term  payoffs  are  often  sacrificed  because  short-term  outlays  cannot  be 
made.  Costs  are  influenced  by  instructional  design,  system  scope,  existing  infrastructure,  partnership  and 
cost-sharing  arrangements,  system  engineering  requirements,  financial  arrangements  (such  as  to  lease  or 
to  buy),  programming,  and  training.  Annual  subscription  costs,  upgrades  and  updates  must  also  be 
considered.  Many  states  cite  lack  of  funding  as  inhibiting  improved  and  increased  use  of  technology  in 
their  schools. 

The  federal  government  and  state  regulatory  agencies  will  need  to  adopt  new,  flexible,  and 
effective  policies  that  address  the  use  of  technology  for  education.  Currently,  federal  and  state 
telecommunications  policies  limit  the  number  and  kind  of  telecommunications  services  available  for 
distance  education. 

The  Star  Schools  Act  sought  to  establish  multistate,  organizationally  diverse  partnerships  to  write 
and  deliver  both  core  and  enrichment  curriculum  and  to  provide  opportunities  for  disadvantaged  students 
to  receive  remote  instruction.  The  program,  passed  by  the  100th  Congress  in  1988,  funded  four 
multistate,  public/private  partnerships  for  distance  education  and  set  as  its  goal  "...  addressing]  two 
critical  needs  in  the  rebuilding  of  our  educational  system  to  meet  domestic  and  international  challenges. 
The  Nation’s  students  must  have  access  to  basic  and  advanced  courses  in  mathematics,  science,  and 
foreign  languages,  and  these  courses  must  be  of  the  highest  quality." 


NON-ACADEMIC  SERVICES 

Health  and  Social  Services 

The  role  of  the  school  has  changed  over  time.  "Even  in  particularly  effective  schools,  family 
background  is  the  best  predictor  of  student  achievement.  "[39]  The  breakup  of  the  two-parent  family,  the 
growing  culture  of  drugs  and  violence  in  our  schools  and  society,  and  the  increasing  number  of  children 
having  children,  has  led  to  an  extension  of  the  school’s  role.  Schools  now  deliver  a  variety  of  services 
outside  the  traditional  educational  environment  such  as  child  care  and  parenting  education,  nutrition  and 
health  care,  and  substance  abuse  treatment. 

The  role  of  public  education  in  these  non-traditional  areas  is  problematic,  both  in  terms  of  funding 


121 


and  as  a  matter  of  appropriateness.  For  the  children  of  minorities  and  disadvantaged  populations  who 
are  at  risk,  these  services  are  essential.  These  programs  may  detract  from  instructional  time  and  may 
effect  extension  of  the  school  day  and  the  evolution  of  the  school  as  family  substitute  (particularly  in 
urban  and  inner  city  schools).  Lack  of  these  services  will  cause  larger  societal  problems  (and  more  costly 
measures)  later  on. 

Preprimary,  social  service  "education"  programs,  viewed  as  beneficial  "preventive"  measures, 
began  as  federal  initiatives.  Funding  has  now  become  both  a  federal  and  state  responsibility.  Preprimary 
education  directed  at  disadvantaged  segments  of  the  population  seeks  to  prepare  these  children  for 
elementary  school  instruction.  Chapter  1  programs  such  as  Head  Start,  that  target  preschool  children, 
have  been  supplemented  by  the  Even  Start  initiative.  Even  Start  combines  basic  education  for  parents 
(those  in  adult  literacy  programs)  with  school  readiness  training  for  children  ages  one  through  seven  who 
may  be  educationally  at  risk.  Even  Start  seeks  to  boost  the  academic  performance  of  disadvantaged 
children  by  identifying  the  medical,  nutritional,  and  other  social  problems  that  might  inhibit  a  child’s 
success  in  school  and  in  the  long  run  reduce  crime  and  save  taxpayer  money.  The  goal  is  to  provide  long¬ 
term  payoffs  by  giving  disadvantaged  youths  a  better  chance  to  become  productive  citizens.  The  price 
paid  for  not  funding  such  programs  will  be  higher  in  the  future,  when  disadvantaged  youth  become 
nonproductive  members  of  the  work  force. 

Kindergarten  and  Pre-school  Programs 

Statistics  show  that  the  percentage  of  three-  and  four-year  olds  attending  preschool  increased  from 
about  14  percent  in  1967  to  38  percent  in  1987,  and,  as  a  consequence  of  increased  enrollment,  the 
preparation  for  formal  schooling--"readiness"— also  has  improved. 

Most  preschool  programs  are  private  and  attended  by  predominantly  middle  class,  nonminority 
populations.  The  acknowledged  disparity  in  educational  performance  between  those  attending  preschool 
(an  advantage)  and  those  without  preschool  experience  (a  disadvantage)  will  pressure  many  public  school 
systems  to  provide  prekindergarten  programs  for  all  children.  The  number  of  public  schools  offering 
preschool  education  programs  will  expand,  but  fiscal  restraint  will  limit  growth.  Prekindergarten 
programs  with  "educational"  curricula  will  increase. 

Although  most  kindergarten  programs  already  have  high  enrollment  rates,  kindergarten  may 
become  mandatory  in  the  next  century.  The  kindergarten  program  will  become  more  "academic." 


OTHER  INNOVATIONS 

Expanded  School  Dav/Year-round  School 

The  length  of  the  school  day  and  the  school  year  in  the  United  States,  a  holdover  from  the 


122 


nineteenth  century,  is  shorter  than  that  of  the  industrialized  countries  of  the  Pacific  Rim  that  outperform 
the  United  States  in  international  comparisons.  There  are  obstacles,  however,  to  extending  the  school 
day  and  the  school  year:  money,  teachers’  unions,  businesses  desiring  cheap  labor  over  summer 
holidays,  and  other  special  interest  lobbies,  such  as  the  recreation  industry. 

An  expanded  school  day  and  extended  school  year  will  become  a  contentious  issue  although  it 
was  recommended  by  The  National  Commission  on  Excellence.  The  need  for  a  longer  school  year  may 
be  mitigated  by  a  redirection  and  refocus  of  the  curriculum  and  greater  flexibility  by  all  concerned 
parties.  An  expanded  school  day /term  may  be  combined  with  various  programs.  Those  who  wish  for 
an  extension  of  the  academic  school  year  may  choose  to  do  so.  Greater  flexibility  in  the  school 

calendar  is  another  reform  option.  Some  students  (most  say  the  more  academically  oriented)  will  choose 
a  longer  school  year.  An  extended  or  flexible  school  calendar  that  includes  various  scheduling  options, 
however,  will  not  show  positive  results,  that  is,  achievement  gains,  unless  educational  goals  are  revised, 
since  time  on  task  is  not  the  only  issue. 

Apprenticeship/Intern/Service  Programs 

Apprenticeship  and  intern  programs,  to  include  federal,  state,  local,  national  construction  corps, 
and  community  service-will  continue  to  exist  as  options  (not  necessarily  integrated  into  the  educational 
setting),  but  funding  levels  will  not  expand  and  changes-vis-a-vis  European  models-will  not  be  adopted. 
If  the  business  community  sees  efficacy  in  apprenticeship  and  lobbies  prodigiously,  programs  will  become 
even  more  widespread. 

These  programs  are  possible  components  of  a  flexible  education.  The  incorporation  of  an  internship 

or  national  service  into  the  high  school  curriculum  would  produce  more  well-adjusted,  functionally  literate 
members  of  society.  Such  measures  will  probably  not  be  adopted.  There  may,  however,  be  some 
regional  experiments  with  these  types  of  programs-most  likely  as  business  partnerships. 

Pressure  for  business  and  industry  to  become  more  involved  in  education  will  increase.  As  a 
result,  schools  will  be  better  connected  to  workplaces  and  have  more  links  with  the  business  community. 
Mentorships  must  become  more  widespread. 

It  has  been  suggested  that  the  United  States  adopt  an  apprenticeship  system,  such  as  that  in 
Germany,  as  a  means  of  developing  a  national  skill-building  partnership  between  public  schools  and 
business.  High  schools  in  the  United  States  typically  lack  an  elaborate  job  placement  system,  and  the 
majority  of  vocational  students  end  up  in  jobs  that  have  little  or  nothing  to  do  with  training  received  in 
high  school. 

A  national  apprenticeship  system  would  be  aimed  at  expanding  the  supply  of  skilled  workers, 
narrowing  the  earnings  gap  between  college  and  non-college  youth,  establishing  new  incentives  to  remain 
in  high  school  AND  to  do  well,  and  offering  disadvantaged  youths  a  realistic  alternative  to  a  life  of  early 
parenthood,  drugs,  and  violence.  In  the  tenth  grade,  students  would  choose  between  apprenticeship  or 
an  academic  track.  In  the  eleventh  grade,  students  would  combine  on-the-job  training  with  school.  In 


123 


the  twelfth  grade,  students  would  be  in  their  third  year  of  apprenticeship,  with  75  percent  of  the  time 
spent  on  the  job  and  the  remainder  of  the  time  spent  in  high  school  or  a  community  college.  At  the  end 
of  the  twelfth  grade,  students  would  take  a  comprehensive  test  to  ensure  their  jobs  as  well  as  to  measure 
educational  proficiency. 


CONCLUSION 

Demographics-the  primary  change  driver-will  influence  both  the  trends  in  education  and  the 
reforms  (see  fig.  I).  The  increase  in  the  number  and  proportion  of  disadvantaged  youth,  who 
traditionally  belong  to  minority  populations,  will  be  the  most  important  factor  in  the  school-age 
population.  Public  education  in  the  21st  century  may  largely  serve  minority  and  disadvantaged 
populations.  The  United  States  is  committed  to  the  fundamental  concept  of  providing  public  education, 
but  the  system  itself  may  polarize.  Those  who  can  afford  the  option  will  send  their  children  to  private 
schools. 

Education  reforms  move  slowly.  Although  targeted  at  improving  the  process  of  education,  some 
reforms  face  the  resistance  of  education  bureaucracies,  others  meet  funding  obstacles.  Some  changes  will 
take  a  long  time  to  measure  in  terms  of  results;  other  reforms  lack  adequate  devices  of  measurement. 
By  2015,  the  educational  achievement  level  of  U.S.  youth  will  likely  show  little  or  no  gain  over  present 
levels,  and  preparedness  for  the  work  force  (and  military)  will  still  remain  wanting.  Since  the  decline 
in  achievement  levels  cuts  across  society  and  affects  a  work  force  over  a  period  of  some  50  years,  this 
shortfall  is  enduring,  and  as  previously  noted  will  depress  productivity  well  into  the  21st  century.  As  the 
issue  of  educational  equity  comes  to  the  fore,  education  may  become  more  of  a  societal  leveler. 
Disadvantaged  and  at-risk  youth  may  increase  their  achievement  levels  (gradually  and  marginally),  higher 
achievers  may  not  make  great  gains,  and  those  in  the  middle  may  remain  predominantly  average. 

The  present  education  system-initially  based  on  reading,  writing,  and  arithmetic  (not 
mathematics),  organized  independently  into  units  of  instruction,  was  devised  when  the  United  States  was 
an  agricultural  nation,  and  has  since  changed  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Industrial  Age.  The  future 
education  system,  however,  must  be  revised  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Technological  Age-one  of  global 
interaction  and  interdependence-in  banking,  industry,  production,  resource  allocation,  communication, 
and  information  processing. 

Future  education  programs  must  be  dynamic  and  reflect  the  nature  of  change  in  the  environment. 
Students  must  be  taught  to  acquire  knowledge  and  skills  in  critical  thinking,  reasoning,  language, 
mathematics  and  science;  to  organize  thoughts  and  solve  problems  systematically;  and  to  write  and 
communicate  effectively.  They  must  be  versed  in  good  citizenship  and  community  service,  understand 
their  physical  environment,  the  individual  and  society,  and  possess  the  attitudes  and  norms  of  behavior- 
social  interaction  skills — that  allow  a  person  to  function  effectively  on  a  job.  And,  while  the  U.S. 
business  community  has  adapted  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  changing  international  environment,  the  8:00

am  to  3:00  pm  school  day,  and  the  180-day  school  year  has  remained  the  same.  The  need  for  a  longer 
school  day  and  school  year  is  becoming  more  apparent.

White  males  traditionally  have  higher  educational  levels  and  higher  salaries  than  other  segments 
of  the  population  and  have  been  the  most  employable.  In  the  late  1980s,  white  male  workers  constituted 
almost  half  of  the  work  force;  by  the  year  2000,  they  will  account  for  only  15  percent  of  new  job 
entrants.  The  growth  of  the  black  and  Hispanic  labor  force  will  far  outpace  the  growth  of  the  white  labor 
force.  By  the  year  2015,  more  workers  will  be  women,  blacks,  and  Hispanics;  white  males  will  be  in 
the  minority.  The  same  pattern  will  be  evident  in  school  enrollments.

Although  the  manpower  requirements  for  the  army  will  decrease  and  the  number  of  potential 
applicants  will  increase,  the  military  may  not  have  a  more  functionally  literate  pool  to  choose  from.  The 
proportion  of  at-risk  youth,  in  relation  to  the  rest  of  the  population,  will  pose  a  growing  threat  to  the 
effectiveness  of  the  education  system.  Reforms  will  have  to  move  at  a  quicker  pace  in  order  to  improve 
the  product  of  American  education.  As  Soviet  gains  in  scientific  achievement,  specifically  Sputnik, 
challenged  the  U.S.  education  system  in  the  1950s  and  galvanized  the  country  into  action,  the  loss  of 
competitiveness  in  the  international  economic  arena  (particularly  to  Japan  and  Europe)  may  spur  U.S. 
education  into  the  21st  century.  Economic  conditions,  however,  may  make  the  military  a  more  attractive 
option,  and  the  military  may  not  be  faced  with  recruiting  from  a  less  than  attractive  pool  of  applicants.

APPENDIX  A 


EDUCATION:  THE  JAPANESE  APPROACH 

In  Japan,  schooling  emphasizes  diligence,  self-criticism,  and  well-organized  study  habits.  The 
belief  is  ingrained  that  hard  work  and  perseverance  yield  success  in  life.  Much  of  official  school  life  is 
devoted  directly  or  indirectly  to  teaching  correct  attitudes  and  moral  values  and  to  developing  character, 
with  the  aim  of  creating  a  citizenry  that  is  both  literate  and  attuned  to  the  basic  values  of  culture  and 
society.  Starting  pay  for  school  teachers  is  higher  than  any  other  public  servants  in  Japan,  and  higher  or 
equal  to  that  of  engineers.  The  Japanese  believe  that  compulsory  schooling  must  provide 

equal  educational  treatment  of  students;  that  all  children  have  the  ability  to  learn  the  material;  that  effort, 
perseverance,  and  self-discipline,  not  academic  ability,  determine  academic  success;  and  that  well- 
organized  study  habits  and  good  behavior  can  be  taught.  A  nationally  designed  curriculum  exposes 
students  to  balanced,  basic  education.  There  is  also  a  relatively  equal  distribution  of  financial  resources 
among  schools. 

The  education  system  is  characterized  by  high  enrollment  and  retention  rates  throughout.  School 
is  compulsory  and  free  to  virtually  all  children  from  grade  one  through  nine.  Upper  secondary  school, 
from  grades  ten  through  twelve,  though  not  compulsory,  attracts  about  94  percent  of  those  who  completed 
lower  secondary  school.  About  one-third  of  all  Japanese  upper  secondary  school  graduates  advance  to 
post  secondary  education--to  full  four-year  universities,  two-year  junior  colleges,  or  to  other  institutions. 
The  rigors  of  the  entrance  examinations  and  the  cramming  sessions  preparing  students  for  them  are  well 
documented. 

The  most  common  type  of  upper-secondary  schools  have  a  full-time,  general  program  that  offers 
academic  courses  for  students  preparing  for  higher  education  and  also  technical  and  vocational  courses 
for  students  expecting  to  find  employment  after  graduation.  More  than  70  percent  of  upper-secondary 
school  students  enrolled  in  the  general  academic  program  in  the  late  1980s. 

Japanese  children  attend  school  five  full  weekdays  and  one-half  day  on  Saturdays.  The  school  year 
has  a  legal  minimum  of  210  days,  but  most  local  school  boards  add  about  30  more  days  for  school 
festivals,  athletic  meets,  and  ceremonies  with  nonacademic  educational  objectives.  The  number  of  days 
devoted  to  instruction  is  about  195  per  year.

APPENDIX  B 


GENERAL  EDUCATIONAL  DEVELOPMENT  CERTIFICATES 

The  number  of  people  who  earn  General  Educational  Development  (G.E.D.--high  school 
equivalency)  certificates  dropped  25  percent  in  the  1980s.  In  1980,  approximately  816,000  people  took 
at  least  one  part  of  the  five-part  examination;  approximately  500,200  earned  diplomas.  In  1989, 
approximately  682,700  people  took  some  part  of  the  examination;  376,880  earned  diplomas.  Of  those 
who  took  all  portions  of  the  test,  70  percent  passed  the  examination  in  1980,  compared  to  68  percent  in 
1989.  The  percentage  of  17-  to  18-year-olds  taking  the  G.E.D.  from  1977  to  1987  increased 

as  the  test  became  better  known  and  more  widely  accepted  as  an  alternative  to  a  high  school  diploma. 
In  1981,  71 1,000  people  took  the  G.E.D.  and  72  percent  passed;  slightly  less  than  one-third  of  the  test 
takers  were  19  years  old  or  younger.  Many  of  those  who  passed  the  G.E.D.,  however,  had  only  a  sixth 
grade  reading  level. 

By  the  1980s,  the  biggest  drop  in  the  number  of  G.E.D.  examinees  was  among  adults  ages  18 
to  24.  In  1980,  519,000  people  of  this  age  group  took  the  G.E.D.;  in  1989,  only  380,000  people  took 
the  test.  Some  educators  speculated  that  the  addition  of  an  essay  section  to  the  G.E.D.  in  1988  made  the 
test  more  difficult  and  may  have  scared  off  potential  test  takers.  Educators  also  believe  that  many  young 
adults  are  unfamiliar  with  the  exam  and  might  be  more  interested  in  landing  jobs  and  earning  money 
quickly~as  entry-level  jobs  can  be  gotten  without  high  school  or  equivalency  diplomas--than  in 
educational  achievement.  There  has  also  been  speculation  that  the  G.E.D.’s  credibility  may  have 
inadvertently  been  damaged  by  the  military.  Since  1970,  the  services  have  been  working  to  reduce  their 
attrition  rates  and  they  have  given  higher  priority  to  recruiting  people  who  have  graduated  from  high 
school.  Statistics  show  that  high  school  graduates  are  more  likely  to  remain  in  the  armed  forces  than 
recruits  with  G.E.D.  diplomas. 

G.E.D.  candidates  mirror  demographic  trends.  An  increasing  number  of  test  takers  were 
Hispanic--6.8  percent  in  1980,  but  11.2  percent  by  1989.  The  number  of  test  takers  who  are  black  has 
declined  over  the  last  decade-ffom  17  percent  in  1980  to  14.2  percent  in  1989.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 
AMERICAN  SOCIETY  IN  2015 


—  Two  powerful  trends  will  profoundly  affect  American  society  in  coming  decades:  the 
ever-increasing  interconnectedness  of  the  world  economy  and  the  steady  aging  of  the  U.S.  population. 
Economic  globalization  will  challenge  U.S.  businesses  on  numerous  fronts.  The  aging  population  will 
make  great  demands  on  U.S.  resources,  both  material  and  human,  through  increased  needs  for  pensions 
and  medical  care. 

—  Increasing  globalization  of  the  economy  will  mean  that  business  activity  will  no  longer 
necessarily  benefit  the  U.S.  workforce.  Corporations  may  be  headquartered  in  the  United  States,  but 
their  manufacturing  activity  will  be  undertaken  elsewhere.  A  decline  in  the  overall  standard  of  living  is 
likely. 

—  Declining  living  standards  will  not  be  limited  to  manufacturing  jobs,  but  will  reach 
white-collar  workers  as  well:  the  increasing  use  of  computers  may  create  "electronic  sweatshops."  The 
need  for  higher  productivity  and  profitability  will  lead  to  further  compression  of  the  middle  management 
positions,  indicating  fewer  employment  opportunities  for  mid-level  professionals,  hence  a  lack  up  upward 
mobility.  A  two-tiered  American  workforce  will  gradually  appear:  one,  relatively  small,  propsering  in 
the  new  harsh  global  economy;  the  other,  perhaps  three-quarters  of  workers,  able  to  find  only  low-paid 
and  insecure  employment.  The  buoyant  optimism  characterizing  American  society  since  its  inception, 
could  be  extinguished  and  create  social  tensions  without  precedent. 

—  The  traditional  nuclear  family  will  make  up  only  one-fourth  of  American  households. 
The  increase  in  single-parent  families,  headed  by  a  woman  and  having  serious  economic  concerns,  is  a 
persistent  trend.  Many  of  these  families  will  be  found  in  the  military  and  additional  family  services  will 
need  to  be  provided. 

—  The  increasing  number  of  retirees  and  the  shrinking  labor  force  (a  concommitant 
decline  in  the  fertility  rate  and  dramatic  increase  in  longevity)  will  intensify  economic  (tax)  pressure  on 
workers.  Also  important  is  the  fact  that  the  vast  majority  of  retirees  will  be  white  and  a  higher 
percentage  of  workers  supporting  retirees  will  be  nonwhite.  Racial  and  ethnic  conflicts  could  develop. 

-  The  U.S.  Army  will  have  a  smaller  pool  of  potential  recruits,  but  may  reap  the 
benefits  of  uncertain  economic  fortunes:  in  a  harsh  economic  climate  and  stable  long-term  employment 
more  unlikely,  the  Army  may  have  the  top-quality  pool  for  recruits.  This,  coupled  with  the  need  for 
fewer  recruits  (assuming  the  Cold  War  rivalry  with  the  Soviet  Union  has  ended),  could  ensure  that  the 
Army  will  have  a  substantial  pool  of  high-quality  applicants  from  which  to  choose.

AMERICAN  SOCIETY  IN  2015 


INTRODUCTION 

This  paper  begins  with  several  assumptions:  the  assumption  that  there  will  be  no  disruptive 
world  war  or  gigantic  natural  catastrophe  in  the  next  decade  or  two;  that  the  Cold  War  will  come  to  an 
end  in  the  1990s  and  that  there  will  be  no  nuclear  war  between  the  superpowers,  whether  intentional  or 
accidental;  and  that  no  crazed  Third  World  dictator  or  terrorist  group  will  detonate  a  nuclear  device  or 
unleash  germ  warfare  within  the  boundaries  of  the  United  States.  The  latter  action,  not  impossible  in 
coming  decades,  could  kill  millions  of  Americans  and  make  whole  regions  of  the  country  uninhabitable. 

The  assumption  is,  then,  that  the  world  of  the  new  century  will  develop  peacefully  out  of  the 
world  of  today,  and  that  the  only  warfare  experienced  by  the  major  industrialized  countries  will  be 
commercial  in  nature.  Western  Europe  will  unite  to  become  a  powerful  commercial  bloc,  the  Pacific  Rim 
will  be  even  stronger  economically,  and  the  United  States  will  have  its  hands  full  competing  in  an  ever 
more  interconnected  global  economy. 

In  this  view,  the  great  over-arching  change  driver  in  the  coming  decades  will  be  the  challenges 
this  new  global  economy  presents  to  the  United  States.  Americans’  lives  will  be  altered  by  their 
country’s  attempts,  sometimes  successful,  sometimes  not,  to  hold  its  own  in  a  much  harsher  economic 
climate.  The  country’s  future  commercial  dominance  is  no  longer  assured,  and  the  lazy  business  practices 
and  casual  government  trade  policies  so  prevalent  in  the  past  will  no  longer  be  sufficient.  The  1970s  and 
1980s  were  hard  decades  for  the  American  economy,  and  in  numerous  areas,  technical  and  commercial, 
the  United  States  no  longer  came  in  first  place  in  the  global  economic  race.  No  trends  indicate  that  the 
next  decades  will  be  any  less  challenging. 

The  trade  wars  of  coming  decades  will  demand  much  from  the  United  States.  However,  the 
military  role  the  United  States  began  to  play  during  World  War  II  and  maintained  up  until  the  virtual 
collapse  of  the  communist  system  within  the  Soviet  Union  is  likely  to  be  no  longer  necessary,  at  least  on 
such  a  broad  scale.  This  fact  will  allow  the  United  States  to  direct  its  energies  to  meet  the  challenges 
posed  by  the  global  economy,  challenges  that  will  force  the  country  to  adapt  itself  to  new  economic 
conditions  if  it  wishes  to  retain  its  geopolitical  dominance  and  ensure  its  citizens  a  high  standard  of  living. 

In  the  view  of  many  analysts,  the  situation  is  stark.  A  nightmare  scenario  is  that  the  United 
States  will  fail  to  meet  the  challenge,  and,  like  so  many  great  powers  of  the  past,  will  enter  a  period  of 
decline,  coming  over  time  to  resemble  Third  World  countries  that  sell  raw  materials  and  foodstuffs  and 
import  finished  goods.  On  the  other  hand,  some  futurists  of  the  "gee  whiz"  variety  predict  that  this 
country  will,  in  the  course  of  the  next  few  decades,  transform  itself  into  a  post-industrial,  high-tech 
society  in  which  an  educated  population  performs  satisfying  and  well-paid  work  and  leads  a  life  of  self- 
fulfillment  and  ease.  This  forecast  is  not  likely  to  come  to  pass,  given  the  recent  economic  trends 
mentioned  above,  unless  the  United  States  undergoes  a  dramatic  transformation  in  the  next  few  decades. 
Unfortunately,  another  scenario  is  more  likely:  the  United  States  will  remain  a  manufacturing  country, 


138 


but  only  for  certain  products,  and  much  of  this  production  will  be  managed  by  firms  with  foreign 
ownership.  Some  American  firms  will  remain  leaders  in  their  specialties,  but  their  focus  will  be  global, 
rather  than  domestic.  Production  will  occur  where  it  is  most  advantageous,  and  the  "Americaness"  of 
these  firms  will  be  only  a  souvenir  of  their  past  history  and  the  location  of  their  headquarters. 

The  America  of  this  scenario  will  differ  from  the  America  of  the  past  in  that  the  country’s 
traditional  belief  that  all  citizens  have  a  good  chance  for  economic  betterment  will  no  longer  conform  to 
reality.  The  society  emerging  from  this  dark  scenario  will  be  an  Orwellian  vision  of  a  prosperous 
minority  and  an  impoverished  majority. 

The  new  society’s  elite  minority  will  have  the  skills  needed  to  thrive  in  the  global 
information/service  economy.  The  members  of  this  elite  will  have  work  that  is  pleasant,  stimulating,  and 
well  paid.  They  will  apply  their  ideas  and  talents  wherever  they  bring  the  most  advantage;  because  of 
telecommunications,  international  boundaries  will  not  exist  for  them.  Their  companies  will  scour  the 
earth  for  business  opportunities,  and  production  will  be  located  where  conditions  are  most  favorable. 
Profits  will  accrue  to  the  skilled  minority.  Their  offspring  will  have  access  to  fine  schooling  that  will 
permit  them  to  follow  their  parents’  careers. 

The  poor  majority,  however,  will  not  be  able  to  meet  global  challenges,  will  not  be  able  to 
compete  with  the  low  wages  paid  in  the  Third  World,  and  will  not  possess  the  highly  specialized 
analytical  skills  that  would  make  them  valuable  to  the  new  global  economy.  The  majority  will  have  to 
be  content  with  dead-end  occupations  and  work  as  menial  physical  laborers,  low-grade  service  personnel, 
industrial  assembly  workers,  and  routine  operators  in  "electronic  sweatshops." 

Analysts  fear  that  these  workers,  perhaps  as  much  as  80  percent  of  the  work  force,  will  have 
access  only  to  a  mediocre  school  system,  ill-equipped  to  train  them  in  skills  that  would  make  them 
competitive  in  the  global  economy.  Forced  to  take  low  wages  because  their  talents  can  be  bought  cheaply 
abroad  or  are  readily  available  domestically,  the  majority  of  the  work  force  will  have  a  declining  standard 
of  living.  The  high  wages  enjoyed  by  ordinary  wage-earners  during  the  first  three  or  four  decades  after 
World  War  II  will  be  only  a  dim  memory  for  this  new  underclass.  [40] 

If  existing  economic  trends  continue,  this  bleak  scenario  of  America’s  future  could  become 
reality.  The  1980s  saw,  for  example,  a  decline  in  the  living  standards  of  many  ordinary  working 
Americans,  many  of  whom  are  living  no  better  than  they  did  in  1970.  In  the  1980s,  the  United  States 
became  the  world’s  greatest  debtor  nation  and  endured  an  unbroken  string  of  trade  deficits.  The 
country’s  national  debt  tripled,  its  prison  population  doubled,  and  its  technical  and  business  dominance 
in  many  areas  was  lost.  Many  Americans  came  to  feel  that  their  country  had  somehow  lost  its  way,  and 
they  wondered  whether  their  social  and  governing  institutions  were  adequate. 

Given  these  unfavorable  trends,  some  observers  have  concluded  that  American  society  is 
reaching  a  crisis  point,  that  the  1990s  will  be  the  decade  in  which  the  country  must  change  significantly 
if  its  ordinary  wage-earners  are  to  retain  their  privileged  place  in  the  world.  The  challenges  posed  by 
the  new  global  economy  could  be  the  change  drivers  that  would  transform  this  country  in  the  coming 
decades.  These  challenges  might  cause  American  society  to  become  more  efficient  and  solve  its  problems 


139 


n  the  most  effective  way  possible.  Waste  of  resources,  human  and  natural,  could  be  reduced  to  a 
minimum  as  the  United  States  seeks  a  secure  future.  A  further  result  could  be  that  social  problems  will 
be  examined  with  new  eyes,  new  solutions  developed,  and  new  methods  devised  to  implement  these 
solutions. 

Many  of  these  new  solutions  will  be  unpopular  for  they  will  break  with  established  ways  of 
thought.  Their  implementation  will  require  public  support,  however.  Securing  this  support  will  require 
much  dissemination  of  relevant  information  about  the  workings  of  a  complex  society,  much  discussion 
and  argument,  and  trust  in  the  decisions  of  an  informed  public.  The  serious  challenges  posed  by  the  new 
global  economy  will  perhaps  heighten  the  overall  social  consciousness  and  permit  bold  and  creative 
decisions  to  be  made. 

There  is  almost  universal  agreement  that  the  United  States  of  the  early  1990s  is  confronted  with 
many  serious  social  problems.  Increased  incidence  of  crime,  growing  health  care  needs  and  costs, 
deficiencies  in  the  education  system,  budget  deficits,  a  decaying  infrastructure,  an  aging  population, 
entrenched  urban  and  rural  poverty  are  the  most  obvious  problems.  There  is  not  yet,  however,  much 
agreement  about  how  to  deal  with  them,  and  this  lack  of  consensus  is  in  itself  a  serious  problem. 
However,  the  country’s  tradition  of  practical  optimism  makes  it  possible  that  solutions  will  emerge. 

One  social  trend  is  certain  for  the  America  of  the  next  century.  That  great  bulge  of  population 
growth,  the  Baby  Boomers,  the  76  million  Americans  born  between  1946  and  1964,  is  aging.  Its  oldest 
members  will  become  55  in  2001  and  65  in  2011.  Its  youngest  member  can  be  expected  to  die  at  an 
advanced  age  about  the  year  2068.  The  aging  of  the  baby  boom  will  have  profound  effects  on  virtually 
all  aspects  of  American  society.  It  will  be  a  change  driver  of  unforeseeable  dimensions. 

Americans  over  65  will  take  an  ever-increasing  share  of  the  federal  budget.  In  1940  this  group 
received  2  percent  of  federal  expenditures;  in  1970  20  percent;  in  1989  27  percent;  and  in  2001  an 
estimated  30  percent.  By  2015  their  share  will  be  approaching  33  percent.  They  will  receive  government 
funds  for  their  pensions  and  their  health  care,  and,  when  they  are  no  longer  able  to  care  for  themselves, 
for  there  nursing  home  care.  As  they  become  an  ever  greater  segment  of  the  population,  the  expense  of 
their  maintenance  will  increase  almost  exponentially,  for  there  will  be  an  even  larger  number  of  "old-old" 
people  over  the  age  of  80,  already  the  fastest  growing  group  in  America. 

By  2015  there  will  be  more  than  eleven  million  of  the  old-old,  an  age  cohort  that  requires  much 
personal  care.  The  prevalence  of  the  old-olds  will  alter  the  overall  social  needs  of  the  elderly.  In  1985, 
90  percent  of  the  elderly  could  care  for  themselves;  by  the  year  2000  only  80  percent  will  be  able  to  do 
so.  Specialists  estimate  that  one  100-bed  nursing  care  facility  will  have  to  be  built  every  day  during  the 
1990s  to  meet  the  growing  needs  of  the  elderly. 

Many  other  needs  of  the  aging  population  will  cause  similar  shifts  in  the  expenditure  of  time 
and  resources:  human,  material,  and  financial.  The  "graying"  of  the  population  will  affect  all  segments 
of  society:  how  it  lives,  its  way  of  doing  business,  its  politics,  its  allotment  of  housing,  its  way  of 
spending  leisure  time,  and  its  values. 

These  two  overarching  trends,  the  growth  of  a  competitive  world  economy  and  the  aging  of 


140 


America,  will  affect  the  military  establishment  in  numerous  ways.  The  aging  population  will  also  take 
an  ever  greater  share  of  the  country’s  wealth,  in  addition  to  no  longer  being  a  source  of  production  itself. 
In  short,  fewer  resources  will  be  available  for  military  purposes.  If  the  assumption  that  the  Cold  War 
will  wane  is  correct,  then  there  may  be  a  lessened  need  for  as  large  a  military  establishment.  Even  so, 
the  scramble  for  resources  to  maintain  a  smaller,  but  professional  and  high-tech  military  will  be  intense 
and  potentially  polarizing  in  the  crisis  situation  facing  the  United  States  in  coming  decades. 

While  a  military  force  of  some  sort  will  always  be  essential,  military  power  alone  will  not  be 
a  key  factor  in  determining  a  country’s  strength  in  an  era  of  strong  commercial  rivalries.  Countries  with 
strong  economies  will  be  independent;  countries  with  ailing  economies  will  fare  poorly  in  coming 
decades.  The  Soviet  Union  is  a  military  giant,  yet  it  cannot  feed  its  people.  The  military  power  of  the 
United  States  cannot  stop  the  decay  of  the  old  industrial  zones  of  the  northeastern  parts  of  the  country 
or  cure  the  social  blight  of  the  inner  cities.  In  the  face  of  pressing  domestic  needs  that  if  not  addressed 
threaten  this  country’s  health,  the  military  will  have  difficulty  obtaining  its  desired  share  of  national 
resources. 

SOCIAL  STRUCTURE 
Family 


In  the  first  decades  of  the  new  century,  the  traditional  nuclear  family  of  husband,  wife,  and  their 
natural  offspring  will  be  the  exception  rather  than  the  norm.  This  fact  is  already  the  case  at  the  beginning 
of  the  1990s,  when  the  "traditional"  family  makes  up  only  one-fourth  of  households.  The  frequency  of 
divorce,  later  marriages  and  remarriages,  relaxed  attitudes  about  extramarital  sexual  relations,  a 
disinclination  to  marry  on  the  part  of  many,  women’s  entry  into  the  work  place,  and  the  large  numbers 
of  elderly  with  deceased  spouses  are  reasons  for  the  declining  prevalence  of  the  traditional  family. 
Because  there  seems  to  be  little  reason  to  believe  that  any  of  these  social  trends  will  diminish,  the 
traditional  nuclear  family  will  probably  retain  its  minority  status  in  coming  years. 

A  very  disquieting  social  trend  almost  certain  to  continue  into  the  future  is  the  upsurge  of 
illegitimacy  and  single-parent  families  that  took  place  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  (see  Fig.  1).  During  these 
decades,  the  U.S.  rate  of  illegitimacy  became  the  highest  in  the  industrial  world  and  yielded  a  new  social 
subgroup  of  largely  fatherless  families.  This  social  subgroup  showed  an  unusually  short  generational 
span.  Most  of  these  mothers  were  teenagers  when  they  first  gave  birth;  they  became  grandmothers  in 
their  mid-thirties  and  great-grandmothers  by  the  age  of  fifty. 

It  is  likely  that  the  prevalence  of  illegitimacy  will  continue  to  be  socially  significant  in  the  next 
century.  There  is  little  reason  to  assume  a  transformation  of  popular  attitudes  about  sexual  morality. 
American  society  is  now  so  secular  that  religious  strictures  relating  to  sex  have  little  credence,  especially 
for  sexually  active  youth.  The  economic  conditions  that  make  obtaining  properly  paid  employment  so 
difficult  for  many  minorities  are  likely  to  continue,  with  the  result  that  many  minority  males  will  not  be 


141 


able  to  earn  enough  to  support  a  family.  The  establishment  of  an  extensive  program  of  effective  sex 
education  for  America’s  youth,  coupled  with  a  wide  dispensing  of  contraceptives,  could  reverse  the 
prevalence  of  illegitimacy.  The  provision  of  better  paying  jobs  for  minorities  could  reduce  the  number 
of  single-parent  families.  Given  the  challenging  economic  conditions  of  the  next  decades,  and  the 
controversial  nature  of  these  social  programs,  such  measures  will  be  difficult  to  effect. 

The  American  family  is  not  in  danger  of  extinction.  It  will  continue  to  be  the  core  unit  of 
society  in  the  next  century,  but  trends  indicate  that  it  will  exist  in  a  variety  of  forms.  Communal 
arrangements,  homosexual  marriages,  transgenerational  unions,  as  well  as  and  other  types  of  families  will 
be  common.  Specialists  believe,  however,  that  three  family  types  will  be  dominant  in  the  early  years  of 
the  next  century. [49] 

Closest  to  the  traditional  family  unit  will  be  first  marriages,  usually  entered  into  after  the  couple 
has  lived  together  for  a  time.  Cohabitation,  relatively  rare  in  mainstream  America  as  late  as  the  1960s, 
will  likely  come  to  be  acceptable  and  unremarkable  by  most  people  in  the  next  decades.  Figures  illustrate 
an  already  substantial  change  in  attitudes.  In  1964  only  11  percent  of  couples  had  lived  together  before 
marriage;  two  decades  later,  the  figure  was  44  percent.  Employment  trends  also  make  for  differences. 
Uni  ike  what  was  true  in  most  marriages  in  the  first  decades  after  World  War  II,  both  spouses  will  be 
employed,  and  perhaps  a  quarter  of  these  marriages  will  be  childless.  Only  better-off  families  will  have 
the  economic  means  for  mothers  to  remain  at  home  and  care  for  the  children  full-time. 

A  second  type  of  family,  die  single-parent  family,  will  be  a  result  of  separation,  divorce,  or 
illegitimate  births.  Families  of  this  type  will  usually  be  headed  by  a  woman,  have  serious  economic 
worries,  and  occur  with  the  highest  rate  of  frequency  among  blacks. 

Most  people  who  divorce  eventually  remarry  and  their  new  unions  will  create  ’blended’ 
families,  die  third  most  common  family  type.  These  families  will  consist  of  offspring  from  earlier 
marriages  and  whole  sets  of  step-relations.  One  specialist  has  estimated  that  over  60  percent  of  the 
children  born  in  the  late  1980s  will,  at  some  time  in  their  childhood,  live  in  such  families.  ’Blended’ 
families  are  not  especially  stable  and  will  yield  more  divorces  and  remarriages  and  even  larger  ’blended’ 
families,  the  size  or  form  of  which  depend  on  each  family  member’s  position  in  a  large  and  complex 
system  of  kinships.  A  divorced  woman,  for  example,  is  not  likely  to  regard  her  former  spouse  as  a 
family  member,  but  her  children  will  if  they  see  their  father  on  a  regular  basis.  Furthermore,  they  will 
regard  his  relatives  as  part  of  their  extended  family.  In  effect,  they  will  have  another  family  apart  from 
their  mother.  A  family  of  this  type  is  very  different  from  the  traditional  nuclear  family,  with  its  two 
parents  and  four  grandparents.  Children  may  emerge  from  it  insecure  and  emotionally  distant,  or  they 
may  thrive  on  the  stimulation  provided  by  the  wide  variety  of  relatives  with  whom  they'  come  into 
contact.

Fig.  1 


:  - : 


Some  observers  of  the  American  family  see  a  rebirth  of  the  extended  family  through  the  closer 
involvement  of  older  people,  not  just  grandparents  or  blood  relatives,  in  the  lives  of  families.  The  large 
numbers  of  older,  yet  healthy  and  energetic,  persons  in  the  society  could  assist  the  small  nuclear  family. 
The  presence  of  caring  older  people  could  alleviate  the  need  for  child  care  centers,  for  example.  The 
existence  of  laws  in  all  states  that  protect  grandparents’  rights  to  see  their  grandchildren  indicates  the 
increasing  importance  of  older  people  in  the  raising  of  children.  Another  such  indication  is  the  increasing 
use  of  older  people  as  volunteers  in  schools.  In  a  society  of  scarce  resources,  older  people  will  have 
more  to  do  in  the  next  century. 

These  family  trends  pose  difficulties  for  the  military.  The  trend  toward  a  multiplicity  of  family 
types  will  make  the  provision  of  family  services  difficult  to  plan.  The  prevalence  of  single-parent  families 
will  be  seen  in  military  families  as  well  and  could  make  the  quick  deployment  of  such  parents  almost 
impossible  if  there  is  no  extensive  support  system  of  child-care  facilities.  A  soldier  concerned  about  the 
welfare  of  his  or  her  children  will  not  be  totally  effective.  The  lack  of  family  stability  in  soldiers’  lives 
will  also  affect  job  performance.  A  further  worry  is  that  the  offspring  of  fluid  families  will  be 
maladjusted  and  bring  their  personal  problems  with  them  into  the  military  when  they  become  soldiers. 

Soldiers  from  single-parent  families  may  have  suffered  deprivations  in  their  childhood  and  may 
be  rather  troubled  individuals.  A  special  difficulty  for  the  military  is  that  many  of  the  young  people  from 
families  of  this  kind  will  not  have  had  a  strong  authority  figure  in  their  lives.  For  some  the  military,  with 
its  set  hierarchy,  will  be  a  welcome  refuge,  offering  security  for  the  first  time  in  their  lives;  others  will 
find  discipline  intolerable. 

The  emerging  trends  in  the  American  family  are  so  new  that  their  social  results  are  still 
uncertain.  The  military  establishment  will  cope  with  them  as  best  it  can.  The  old  army  that  consisted 
to  a  large  degree  of  young  unmarried  male  conscripts  is  long  gone.  It  could  perhaps  be  resurrected 
through  a  reintroduction  of  the  draft  and  gradually  reducing  the  number  of  military  families.  Resource 
shortages  may  preclude  the  many  and  expensive  benefits  now  offered  to  military  families  and  destabilizing 
family  trends  may  make  the  military’s  present  policy  of  relying  on  a  large  professional  force  consisting 
of  married  soldiers  of  both  sexes  an  impossibility  in  the  next  century. 

Generational  differences 

In  the  America  of  the  next  century,  older  people  will  outnumber  the  young.  The  median  age 
of  Americans  will  rise,  going  to  37.6  in  2015,  compared  to  25  in  1965  and  30  in  1980.  Some 
calculations  indicate  that  there  are  presently  28  million  Americans  over  the  age  of  65;  by  2020  there  may 
be  60  million.  The  number  of  very  old,  that  is,  over  the  age  of  85,  will  increase  sharply.  At  the  present 
time  about  9  percent  of  those  over  65  are  85  or  more;  around  the  year  2015  this  figure  will  increase  to 
about  17  percent. 

The  maturing  Baby  Boomers  will  be,  for  the  most  part,  fairly  well  set  by  the  next  century. 
Their  housing  will  be  paid  for.  Pensions  will  have  been  arranged  for  the  first  wave  of  retirements. 


144 


Many  of  these  older  Baby  Boomers  will  be  in  excellent  health  and  quite  active  for  the  first  decade  or  two 
of  their  retirement. 

The  huge  numbers  of  Baby  Boomers  will  mean  that  the  basic  mood  of  the  country  will  be 
different,  for,  as  always  in  their  life,  the  Baby  Boomers  will  be  the  defining  center  of  American  society. 
When  they  were  young,  Baby  Boomers  were  the  raison  d’etre  of  suburbia,  the  lifestyle  that  emerged  after 
World  War  II.  In  the  1960s  and  early  1970s  the  first  Baby  Boomers  reached  the  independence  of  early 
adulthood  and  by  their  way  of  living  established  the  youth  culture.  Some  of  them  were  active  protesters 
against  America’s  involvement  in  Vietnam.  Many  others  were,  at  least  for  a  time,  members  of  the 
counterculture.  In  the  1980s,  some  of  the  younger  Baby  Boomers  became  yuppies  and  colored  an  entire 
decade  by  their  material  success  and  buying  habits. 

The  maturing  Baby  Boomers  will  cause  the  1990s  to  be  a  more  placid  decade  than  the  preceding 
ones.  Most  Baby  Boomers  will  have  established  themselves,  for  better  or  worse.  Their  large  numbers 
will  cause  ever  more  businesses  to  abandon  the  diminishing  youth  market  and  attempt  to  meet  the  needs 
of  a  rapidly  maturing  population.  The  maturing  of  this  great  age  cohort  should  cause  American  society 
to  become  more  reflective  and  stable,  as  a  middle-aged  generation  becomes  dominant. 

In  the  first  years  of  the  21st  century,  the  first  Baby  Boomers  will  begin  to  retire.  Their  material 
concerns  are  likely  to  have  been  largely  taken  care  of,  and  the  older  Baby  Boomers  may,  in  the  opinion 
of  some  specialists,  return  to  the  political  and  ethical  concerns  of  their  youth.  Raised  in  the  largely 
carefree  1950s  and  1960s  by  their  doting  parents,  and  allowed  to  be  independent-minded,  older  Baby 
Boomers  are  often  idealistic.  Making  their  way  in  the  increasingly  difficult  1970s  and  1980s  forced  them 
to  worry  about  earning  a  living  and  raising  their  children.  The  1990s  are  expected  to  be  a  difficult 
decade  economically  for  the  United  States,  but  many  older  Baby  Boomers,  because  of  when  they  were 
born,  will  have  decent  employment  and  housing  by  the  time  this  decade  began. 

According  to  this  proposed  scenario,  these  older  Baby  Boomers  will  examine  their  society  and 
their  lives,  look  for  ethical  coherence,  and  perhaps  bring  to  American  society  a  new  surge  of  high¬ 
mindedness.  Largely  free  of  material  worries  for  themselves,  just  as  they  were  in  their  youth  when  the 
American  economy  seemed  to  promise  an  ever-increasing  standard  of  living  for  all,  these  matured  Baby 
Boomers  may  seek  again  to  reform  American  society.  [42] 

This  scenario  may  prove  unfounded.  Older  people  often  become  conservative  with  age  and, 
with  diminishing  vitality,  more  pessimistic  and  guarded  about  what  is  possible  or  desirable  in  society. 
Matured  Baby  Boomers  may  seek  only  to  ensure  their  own  well-being.  Faced  with  the  obviously 
worsening  problems  of  how  to  care  for  an  aging  America  and  meet  pension  and  health  care  obligations, 
this  generation  could  become  an  obstructive  force  in  American  society,  avoiding  the  sacrifices  and 
preventing  the  fundamental  reforms  needed  to  equip  the  United  States  to  deal  with  the  very  serious 
pension  burdens  that  will  become  critical  in  the  second  and  third  decades  of  the  new  century.  The 
following  figures  show  the  potential  size  of  this  burden.  In  1987  each  Social  Security  retiree  was 
supported  by  a  10.1  percent  payroll  tax  on  4.8  workers;  in  2027  one  estimate  sets  these  figures  at  17 
percent  and  2.3  respectively.  Cost  trends  of  this  nature  may  not  bring  out  the  best  in  people. 


145 


Younger  Americans  are  likely  to  have  a  lower  standard  of  living  than  their  parents.  Their 
housing  will  be  less  good  and  their  career  prospects  less  bright  than  those  of  the  older  generation.  It  will 
be  on  their  shoulders,  however,  that  the  older  generation  will  rest.  The  growing  costs  of  pensions,  the 
older  generation’s  need  for  medical  and  nursing  care,  and  the  nation’s  worsening  dependency  ratio  may 
fuel  resentments  in  young  workers.  It  is  not  at  all  certain  that  they  will  be  willing  to  work  quietly  to 
support  their  elders. 

Class/Race/Gender 


Class 


To  a  remarkable  extent,  American  society  has  been  freer  of  resentments  stemming  from  class 
differences  than  many  other  societies.  There  have  always  been  economic  classes  in  the  United  States, 
but  to  degree  greater  than  elsewhere,  there  has  been  movement  between  classes.  Such  movement  has 
come  about  partly  through  a  generally  increasing  standard  of  living  that,  in  effect,  improved  everyone’s 
social  position  and  partly  through  the  ability  of  individuals  to  climb  the  social  ladder  through  their  own 
abilities  and  industry.  Except  for  the  glaring  anomaly  of  slavery,  this  country  has  never  had  a  feudal 
system  with  its  tradition  of  subservience.  Hence,  most  Americans  think  their  society  offers  them  fair 
chances  for  betterment. 

Some  analysts  question  if  this  perception  of  social  opportunity  will  hold  in  the  next  century. 
The  coming  information/service  economy  will  be  one  in  which  advancement  generally  goes  to  those  with 
highly  specialized  and  expensive  training.  A  further  problem  is  perhaps  even  more  serious.  Some 
forecasts  fear  this  new  economy  will  require  fewer  skilled  people  than  in  the  past,  for  automation  will 
do  many  tasks  formerly  managed  by  skilled  workers.  In  addition,  some  analysts  predict  that  computers 
and  instant  communications  will  move  information  up  and  down  a  company’s  chain  of  command:  the 
result  will  be  elimination  of  many  middle  management  tasks,  with  a  consequent  loss  of  jobs  and  potential 
advancement  for  lower  management.  Firms  are  thus  likely  to  consist  of  small  numbers  of  highly  trained 
and  capable  managers  with  large  numbers  of  workers  performing  routine  and  unskilled  tasks. 

After  World  War  II  many  unskilled,  but  unionized,  American  workers  were  able  to  secure  well¬ 
paying  blue-collar  jobs  in  a  large  manufacturing  sector.  This  sector  is  rapidly  declining  in  importance 
as  a  source  of  jobs.  In  the  late  1980s,  it  supplied  about  20  percent  of  jobs;  by  2015,  it  will  supply  only 
an  estimated  10  percent.  Also  in  decline  is  the  American  labor  movement  and  the  well-paying  jobs  it 
helped  guarantee.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  new  jobs  created  within  the  service  sector  are  badly  paid, 
often  only  slightly  above  the  minimum  wage.  [8] 

In  addition  to  lower  wages,  workers  will  have  less  security.  The  new  global  information/service 
economy  will  be  less  stable  than  the  one  Americans  are  used  to,  and  employees  will  no  longer  be  able 
to  count  on  long-term  permanent  employment.  Workers  will  often  be  required  to  switch  jobs,  firms,  and 
geographical  location  to  remain  employed.  Such  shifting  will  hurt  earnings  and  exact  a  psychological  toll, 


146 


particularly  on  those  employees  who  do  not  have  a  career,  but  are  merely  earning  a  living.  Because  most 
wives  will  be  working,  geographical  mobility  for  displaced  workers  will  also  have  an  impact  on 
marriages. 

This  scenario’s  forecast  of  reduced  opportunities  for  occupational  advancement  and  a  scarcity 
of  jobs  paying  enough  to  secure  at  least  opportunities  for  the  offspring  of  ordinary  wageearners  means 
a  reduction  of  social  mobility  in  American  society.  A  result  with  potentially  wide-ranging  consequences 
could  be  an  increasingly  rigid  social  system  in  which  the  elite  would  become  more  self-recruiting  and 
advancement  from  the  ranks  of  ordinary  workers  more  difficult. 

A  reduction  of  social  mobility  would  soon  undermine  the  long-cherished  American  belief  that 
everyone  has  a  chance  for  economic  and  social  betterment  and  deprive  the  social  system  of  the  legitimacy 
that  it  has  enjoyed  even  in  the  eyes  of  most  poor  Americans.  A  loss  of  legitimacy  often  means  social 
unrest.  Even  during  the  Depression  of  the  1930s,  the  United  States  saw  little  revolutionary  social 
turbulence  compared  to  many  other  countries,  for  most  citizens  accepted  the  basic  social  order.  Social 
unrest  could  become  common  in  the  new  century  if  ordinary  Americans  felt  that  they  had  not  been  given 
fair  economic  and  social  opportunities. 

Because  it  would  offer  young  people  from  all  social  backgrounds  chances  for  decent 
employment  and  social  advancement,  the  military  would  likely  benefit,  at  least  in  the  short  run,  from  a 
more  closed  American  society.  As  other  options  became  less  readily  available,  young  people  would  view 
the  military  as  offering  a  career  of  steady  employment,  no  longer  common  in  the  private  sector,  and 
perhaps  as  a  means  of  obtaining  valuable  training  and  education.  The  military’s  emphasis  on  ability  and 
accomplishment  and  its  egalitarian  traditions,  combined  with  lifetime  employment,  would  make  it 
attractive  to  many.  Hence,  the  military  would  have  a  large  pool  of  applicants  to  chose  from.  In  addition, 
because  its  general  living  conditions  would  contrast  favorably  with  those  of  the  private  sector,  the  military 
would  also  likely  have  good  morale  and  high  retention  rates. 

Race 

The  United  States  has  made  amazing  advances  in  race  relations  in  the  decades  after  World  War  II. 
Although  the  country  has  not  reached  complete  racial  harmony  by  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  the  gains 
of  previous  decades  in  lessening  racial  prejudice  and  discrimination  are  grounds  for  assuming  that 
substantial  progress  in  this  area  will  continue.  Blacks,  for  example,  made  impressive  gains  in  education, 
employment,  and  wage  levels.  Although,  there  are  good  reasons  for  dissatisfaction  about  many  aspects 
of  the  social  conditions  that  many  blacks  still  have  to  endure,  a  sizeable  portion  of  Black  America  belongs 
to  the  middle  class. 

Other  minority  groups  have  shown  similar  or  even  greater  progress.  For  the  most  part,  Asian- 
Americans  have  done  very  well.  Their  children  have  become  proverbial  "curve-busters"  in  California 
universities.  The  first  wave  of  Cuban- Americans,  those  who  fled  Cuba  in  the  early  1960s,  have  also 
prospered  greatly  in  their  new  country.  But  like  Black  Americans,  not  all  of  these  minorities  enjoy  high 


147 


living  standards.  Some  Asians,  the  Hmong  and  Khmers  for  example,  are  having  difficulty  adapting  to 
American  society.  Non-Cuban  Hispanics  also  frequently  meet  with  economic  and  social  difficulties. 

Minority  groups  are  thus  not  monolithic,  and  there  are  no  overall  trends  by  which  to  chart  their 
social  progress.  They  differ  greatly  both  within  themselves  and  in  relation  to  other  minority  groups,  and 
their  path  into  the  future  will  vary.  For  example,  they  are  growing  at  different  rates.  Black  America 
has  a  higher  birth  rate  than  white  America,  but  it  is  being  overtaken  by  Hispanics,  who  sometime  early 
in  the  next  century  are  projected  to  become  the  largest  ethnic  group  in  America.  Asian-Americans,  for 
their  part,  have  a  higher  birthrate  than  whites  or  blacks,  but  lower  than  Hispanics. 

Poorer  blacks  and  Hispanics  do  have  some  features  in  common.  In  the  coming  decades  it  is 
virtually  certain  that  these  two  groups  will  reside  to  a  great  extent  in  the  centers  of  metropolitan  areas. 
In  1990  they  were  already  in  the  majority  in  a  number  of  large  American  cities  and  in  the  first  decade 
of  the  new  century,  these  two  minorities  will  constitute  a  majority  in  just  over  half  the  country’s  100 
largest  cities. 

In  the  next  century,  most  of  America’s  new  jobs  will  be  located  in  the  far-flung  suburbs,  far 
from  the  inner  city.  This  trend  will  mean  that  many  poor  blacks  and  Hispanics  will  be  hurt  not  only  by 
their  lack  of  education,  but  also  by  their  distance  from  where  jobs  exist.  For  these  reasons,  then,  the 
poor  members  of  these  two  groups  will  continue  to  make  up  the  ranks  of  much  of  the  poor,  having  badly 
paid  dead-end  jobs,  or  little  or  no  work  at  all.  These  two  groups  will  form  the  most  visible  parts  of  the 
American  underclass.  The  white  members  of  this  underclass  will  be  much  more  dispersed,  living  mainly 
in  scattered  suburbs  and  in  rural  areas. 

It  is  impossible  to  know  with  certainty  what  race  relations  will  be  like  in  the  early  decades  of 
the  next  century.  There  are  reasons  both  for  optimism  and  pessimism.  The  economic  strains  resulting 
from  the  rigors  of  the  global  economy  will  be  grounds  for  worry.  There  will  be  disagreements  about  the 
allotment  of  scarce  financial  resources.  If  there  is  not  enough  growth  in  the  economy  to  carry  all  groups 
upward,  then  claims  on  the  funds  available  for  direct  government  intervention  to  help  disadvantaged 
groups  could  be  very  keen  and  call  forth  racial  resentments,  already  festering  or  dormant. 

Grounds  for  optimism  are  the  great  material  and  social  gains  achieved  by  many  members  of 
minority  groups  in  recent  decades  and  their  successful  integration  into  mainstream  American  society.  The 
lessening  of  racism  in  social  institutions,  most  notably  the  successful  attempts  of  the  American  military 
to  ease  racial  tensions  and  create  equality,  is  one  of  the  most  encouraging  signs  that  the  United  States  can 
become  a  peaceful,  multiracial  society.  Young  people,  too,  seem  to  be  less  prejudiced  than  their  parents, 
a  fact  noticed  by  many  specialists  when  young  people  of  different  races  mix  freely  together.  Interracial 
dating,  still  troubling  to  many  people,  is  accepted  by  such  youngsters  as  an  ordinary  everyday  occurrence. 
In  addition,  modern  media,  such  as  television  and  the  movies,  allow  America’s  many  different  ethnic 
groups  the  opportunity  to  become  familiar  with  one  another  and  hence  reduce  racial  hostility.  [30] 

A  final  reason  for  hope  is  that  the  United  States  is  committed  by  law  to  the  equal  treatment  of 
all  ethnic  groups.  If  not  always  realized  in  practice,  equal  treatment  is  a  widely  supported  principle  and 
unlikely  to  be  revoked  in  the  foreseeable  future.  All  ethnic  groups  have  organizations  manned  by  skilled 


148 


lawyers  ready  to  represent  and  defend  their  rights  in  courts  of  law.  On  occasion  the  courts  must  deal 
with  absurd  or  wrong-headed  cases  of  alleged  discrimination,  but  their  obligation  to  do  so  protects  the 
rights  of  all  groups.  Mutual  affection  may  not  result  from  these  cases,  but  toleration  and  perhaps  even 
respect  do.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  equality  under  the  law  will  not  be  the  case  in  the  America 
of  the  next  century. 

The  military  will  be  much  affected  by  the  race  relations  within  society  as  a  whole.  If  they  are 
good,  the  military  will  have  a  easier  time  ensuring  that  relations  within  its  organization  are  smooth.  Bad 
relations  will  make  the  military’s  task  more  difficult.  In  the  past,  however,  the  U.S.  military  has  been 
a  path-breaker  in  reducing  racial  discrimination,  and  there  is  no  reason  to  assume  that  this  tradition  will 
not  continue.  If  race  relations  in  the  United  States  became  very  bad,  something  that  is  not  expected,  then 
the  military  would  be  affected  as  well,  perhaps  to  such  an  extent  that  it  could  not  perform  its  tasks 
effectively. 

The  military  is  likely  to  be  only  marginally  affected  by  the  social  problems  of  minorities.  A 
smaller  military  will  need  fewer  personnel,  and  screening  procedures  should  allow  the  military  to  select 
only  those  likely  to  serve  satisfactorily.  Despite  the  smaller  numbers  of  young  people  available  in  coming 
decades,  the  military  will  need  fewer  to  fill  its  reduced  size.  The  social  conditions  sketched  out  in  the 
previous  section  would,  if  they  come  to  pass,  make  military  service  attractive  to  youths  from  all  social 
groups. 

Gender 


There  are  good  reasons  to  be  optimistic  about  women’s  place  in  the  America  of  the  future.  The 
gains  made  by  the  women’s  movement  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  seem  to  be  permanent.  Although  some 
segments  of  American  society  would  like  to  see  women  return  to  being  uniquely  housewives  and  mothers, 
or,  if  they  work,  remain  in  the  "pink  ghetto"  occupations  of  teacher,  nurse,  and  secretary,  most 
Americans  have  come  to  terms  with  women’s  rights.  It  is  difficult  to  imagine  any  political  movement 
that  would  seek  to  undo  the  social  trends  that  have  brought  women  greater  equality  in  recent  decades. 
In  addition,  economic  trends  have  made  employment  outside  the  home  a  necessity  for  most  women, 
married  or  not. 

The  gains  of  the  women’s  movement  in  the  last  25  years  have  been  great,  so  much  so  that 
American  society  has  experienced  a  virtual  revolution  in  these  years.  As  Table  1  shows  [13],  the  number 
of  women  receiving  college  degrees  and  advanced  degrees  has  increased  almost  exponentially  since  1970, 
and  women  have  entered  the  professions  at  an  amazing  rate.

Armed  with  college  degrees,  women  have  entered  the  professions  at  an  unprecedented  rate. 
Women’s  entry  into  the  business  world  has  been  especially  marked:  in  1970  women  represented  only  1 
percent  of  business  travellers;  by  1990,  they  represented  30  percent.  Their  share  is  expected  to  increase 
even  more  in  the  21st  century. 

Women  still  hold  relatively  few  top  management  positions.  This  situation  will  change  in  the 
coming  quarter  century  as  many  of  those  who  entered  business  in  the  last  two  decades  acquire  experience 
and  reach  the  age  at  which  people  usually  assume  the  highest  positions.  If  for  no  other  reason,  the  sheer 
number  of  women  professionals  will  crack  the  so-called  "glass  ceiling"  that  up  to  now  has  limited  a 
woman’s  rise  to  the  upper  levels  of  management. 

Women  will  also  excel  in  the  running  of  small  firms.  Small  businesses  are  a  very  important 
segment  of  the  American  economy,  and  they  will  grow  more  important  in  the  future.  At  present, 
businesses  with  less  than  100  employees  employ  some  80  percent  of  the  work  force.  In  the  coming 
decades,  smaller  contracting  firms  will  replace  many  of  America’s  larger  businesses.  Women  are  already 
well  represented  in  this  area,  having  set  up  about  one-third  of  small  businesses  on  their  own  in  the  1980s. 

In  the  United  States,  women  are  still  grossly  under-represented  on  a  percentage  basis  in  politics 
at  the  national  level.  At  the  local  and  state  level,  however,  women  are  winning  an  ever  increasing 
number  of  elective  offices,  by  some  counts  registering  a  300  percent  gain  in  recent  years.  It  is  only  a 
matter  of  time  until  women  come  to  hold  many  seats  in  congress,  head  government  agencies,  take  a 
greater  share  of  cabinet  posts,  and  even  are  serious  contenders  for  the  presidency. 

In  some  respects,  however,  women  have  done  poorly  and  can  be  expected  to  do  worse  in  the 


150 


future.  Poverty  has  become  ever  more  "feminized,"  mainly  because  women  have  increasingly  become 
the  heads  of  single-parent  households.  This  situation  is  most  true  among  Black  Americans,  where  the 
number  of  unwed  teenaged  mothers  among  the  poor  has  reached  catastrophic  proportions.  The  frequency 
of  divorce  has  meant  that  many  middle-class  white  women  have  also  become  impoverished. 

Women’s  presence  in  the  work  place  and  the  increase  in  the  number  of  single-parent  families 
will  make  the  provision  of  childcare  a  key  social  issue  in  the  1990s.  Not  only  will  the  civilian  sector 
have  to  confront  this  issue,  but  the  military  will  as  well.  Table  2  [29]  illustrates  how  pressing  this  need 
has  become.

Also  certain  to  plague  American  society  in  the  decades  to  come  will  be  the  many  problems 
connected  with  the  increasing  number  of  unwed  teenaged  mothers.  Possible  remedies  will  cause  much 
social  discord  and  consume  significant  resources.  Failure  to  assist  the  children  and  mothers  involved  will 
require  even  greater  expenditures  down  the  road  into  the  next  century. 

The  American  military  has  been  much  affected  by  the  revolution  in  women’s  role  in  society. 
It  has  made  bold  attempts  to  come  to  terms  with  this  role,  but  so  far  with  mixed  results.  In  the  first 
decades  of  the  new  century,  the  many  women  admitted  to  the  service  academies  will  be  eligible  to  fill 
many  of  the  military’s  top  positions.  This  they  will  likely  do,  with  only  occasional  friction,  for  the 
women  promoted  to  these  positions  will  be  individuals  who  adapted  well  to  the  demands  and 
circumstances  of  military  life.  Many  other  women  will  not  have  dealt  so  well  with  these  conditions,  and 
will  have  left  the  military  earlier,  probably  at  a  rate  higher  than  their  male  counterparts. 

Arranging  provisions  to  deal  with  military  families  will  cause  much  trouble  and  perhaps  require 
a  reconsideration  of  policies  now  in  effect.  The  lower  pay  of  enlisted  personnel,  coupled  with  a  less 
serious  commitment  to  their  careers,  will  cause  many  enlisted  women  with  children  to  have  a  troubled 


151 


and  only  short-term  service  career.  Given  the  possibility  for  a  more  peaceful  world  order  in  the  next 
century,  fewer  U.S.  service  personnel  are  likely  to  be  stationed  abroad,  but  instead  be  deployed  overseas 
for  only  brief  campaigns.  This  situation  will  reduce  stress  on  female  soldiers  with  children,  but  not 
eliminate  them.  Family  difficulties  that  showed  up  during  "Desert  Storm"  indicate  that  new  policies  will 
have  to  be  worked  out  if  the  military  continues  to  allow  women  a  service  role  nearly  identical  to  that  of 
men. 

SOCIAL  WELFARE 

The  United  States  has  many  serious  and  worsening  social  problems.  There  is  little  argument 
about  this  fact,  but  much  disagreement  about  how  to  deal  with  these  problems.  A  key  assumption  of  this 
paper  is  that  the  rigors  of  a  highly  competitive  global  economy  will  force  the  country  to  devise  new  ways 
to  draw  maximum  advantage  from  its  most  important  resource,  its  citizens.  An  unhealthy  population, 
badly  trained  and  poorly  motivated,  can  only  be  a  drag  on  the  country’s  competitiveness.  Hence,  the 
press  of  economic  necessity  will  be  the  change  driver  that  pushes  American  society  to  deal  boldly  and 
creatively  with  long-standing  social  ills  and  render  its  work  force  as  productive  as  that  of  its  chief  rivals 
abroad.  Remedies  now  seen  as  controversial  and  experimental  will  be  adopted  to  deal  with  social 
problems  that  traditional  methods  failed  to  cure.  The  devising  of  new  means  to  deal  with  drug  abuse  will 
be  an  example  of  the  trend  toward  a  objective  and  rational  solution  of  social  problems. 

Some  specialists  contend  that  radical  means  will  adopted  within  a  decade  or  so  to  deal  with  the 
consumption  of  drugs  that  are  now  illegal.  At  the  present  time,  drug  abuse  is  devastating  segments  of 
American  society.  The  war  against  drug  abuse  and  trafficking  has  led  to  a  doubling  of  the  country’s 
prison  population  in  the  1980s;  according  to  some  estimates,  the  number  is  scheduled  to  double  again  in 
the  1990s.  This  increase  has  meant  that  the  United  States  has,  in  relative  terms,  the  largest  prison 
population  in  the  world. 

The  recently  mounted  War  on  Drugs  has  had  little  positive  effect.  Specialists  note  that  the 
prevalence  of  drug  abuse  depends  largely  on  social  factors,  not  on  law  enforcement.  The  costs  of 
maintaining  an  enormous  prison  population,  most  often  young  men  in  their  late  teens  and  early  twenties, 
will  come  to  appear  too  expensive  and  ineffective  to  be  continued.  The  now  radical  approach  of 
legalizing  many  drugs  now  illicit  and  spending  money  on  sound  education  about  the  dangers  of  drugs  and 
on  rehabilitation  of  addicts,  will,  in  the  view  of  some  specialists,  come  to  be  seen  over  the  course  of  the 
next  few  years  as  the  most  efficient  way  of  dealing  with  the  drug  problem.  These  specialists  contend  that 
this  solution  will  be  accepted  because  traditional  methods  failed,  and  consumed  too  much  in  the  way  of 
human  and  material  resources.  If  these  specialists  are  correct,  in  the  next  century  drug  addiction  will 
come  to  be  treated  much  as  alcoholism  is  today,  and  most  American’s  will  view  the  War  on  Drugs  much 
as  they  now  judge  the  1920s’  experiment  with  Prohibition. 

Rapidly  growing  pension  and  health  care  costs,  already  a  serious  public  issue,  will  be  even  more 
burdensome  in  the  next  century.  The  aging  of  American  society  gives  this  issue  an  actuality  that 


152 


increases  daily.  Finding  fair  and  efficient  means  for  dealing  with  it  will  mean  making  choices  that  will 
shape  American  society  for  years  to  come.  Because  choices  made  imply  options  closed  off,  the 
management  of  the  issue  has  become  a  significant  change  driver  for  American  society. 

Pensions 


Baby  Boomers  will  begin  to  retire  early  in  the  new  century.  The  so-called  dependency  ratio, 
the  ratio  of  workers  to  non-workers,  will  gradually  worsen.  A  diminishing  work  force  will  have  to  pay 
for  an  increasing  number  of  retirees.  In  the  1980s,  worry  about  the  long-term  health  of  the  Social 
Security  system  led  to  reform;  for  example,  the  long-standing  retirement  age  of  65  was  increased  to  67, 
beginning  early  in  the  next  century.  In  the  future,  retirement  age  will  probably  be  moved  back  even 
more,  to  70  perhaps.  The  change  is  a  logical  one,  for  improved  health  among  the  nation’s  population 
means  that  old  age  starts  later  now  than  it  did  in  the  past.  A  male  who  retired  in  1940  at  age  65,  for 
example,  could  expect  to  live  for  7  years  after  his  retirement,  compared  to  10  years  in  1970  and  15  years 
in  1990. 

Early  retirement  will  become  less  common  in  the  next  century,  for  studies  show  that  retirement 
at  age  60  can  cost  a  pension  fund  two  times  more  than  one  begun  at  67.  Part-time  work  by  the  elderly 
will  become  more  common.  Use  of  older  people  on  a  part-time  basis  has  already  proved  very 
economical.  Part-time  workers,  for  example,  have  been  found  to  produce  more  on  an  hourly  basis  than 
full-time  workers. 

The  military  will  also  be  touched  by  these  trends.  As  military  pensions  (or  "retirement  pay") 
come  to  consume  an  ever  larger  share  of  the  nation’s  resources,  their  generous  provisions  will  probably 
be  cut  back  and  retirement  after  20  years  of  service  may  no  longer  be  allowed.  Today’s  healthier 
population  means  that  40-  and  50-year  olds  are  generally  quite  fit,  able  to  sustain  themselves  even  in  hard 
conditions.  This  fact  will  be  reflected  in  how  long  career  personnel  serve.  If  a  completely  professional 
military  becomes  too  expensive,  it  may  be  replaced  by  a  model  common  in  Europe.  This  model  has  a 
small  professional  cadre  that  serves  through  age  50,  and  then  retires  on  a  pension  or  shifts  to  employment 
elsewhere;  a  larger  highly  trained  group  that  serves  long-term  enlistments,  but  leaves  the  service  without 
pensions;  and  many  draftees  who  serve  a  year  or  two,  then  enter  an  active  or  inactive  reserve.  No 
European  nation  has  been  able  to  afford  a  military  retirement  system  like  that  of  the  United  States,  and 
this  country,  no  longer  incomparably  wealthy  as  it  was  in  the  first  decade  or  two  after  World  War  II,  may 
be  obliged  to  follow  Europe’s  method  of  managing  military  pensions. 

Pensions  will  present  another  problem:  pension  portability,  that  is,  how  to  maintain  an  already 
existing  pension  plan  with  a  new  employer.  The  information/service  economy  will  mean  that  employees 
will  often  change  jobs,  making  pension  portability  of  crucial  importance.  Federal  employees  have  long 
been  able  to  take  their  pensions  with  them  if  they  stay  within  the  federal  work  force  and  reforms  in  the 
1980s  have  broadened  their  options  regarding  pension  portability.  Retired  military  personnel  can  also 
attach  their  military  career  to  time  spent  in  government  service  for  pension  purposes.  This  right  lessens 


153 


the  financial  burden  of  allowing  soldiers  to  retire  with  a  pension  after  twenty  years  of  military  service. 
Eventually,  military  pensions  also  could  be  made  applicable  to  the  private  sector.  For  many  workers  in 
the  private  sector,  however,  solutions  are  only  gradually  being  worked  out. 

Pension  plans  will  become  even  more  important  for  wage-earners  in  the  future  because  declining 
average  incomes  have  meant  that  fewer  Americans  are  able  to  prepare  for  their  old  age  through  personal 
savings.  But  ways  will  have  to  be  found  to  pay  for  these  pensions.  The  Social  Security  payroll  tax  is 
already  a  serious  burden  for  ordinary  wage-earners.  Plans  to  reduce  or  increase  this  tax  can  have 
political  effects  so  vast  and  unforeseeable,  that  politicians  from  the  president  down  fear  for  their  careers 
when  they  have  to  deal  with  the  issue.  Choices  will  have  to  be  made,  however,  and  these  choices  will 
have  to  be  both  effective  and  enjoy  the  support  of  the  electorate.  If  the  choices  are  not  seen  as  fair, 
ordinary  people  will  not  support  them.  If  choices  are  not  wise,  retirement  costs  could  become  so  great 
that  they  will  damage  the  economy.  Young  workers  could  refuse  to  pay  them,  and  businesses  will  not 
be  able  both  to  meet  them  and  remain  competitive  internationally. 

Health  Care 

An  aging  population  will  need  more  care.  Medical  care,  in  turn,  is  becoming  increasingly 
expensive;  many  specialists  in  medical  care  see  the  present  American  system  nearing  the  crisis  stage. 
Costs  rose  so  much  during  the  1980s  that  only  wealthy  Americans  need  not  worry  about  the  devastating 
effects  of  catastrophic  illnesses  that  can  quickly  wipe  out  a  lifetime  of  careful  saving.  At  the  beginning 
of  the  1990s,  only  about  10  percent  of  Americans  were  basically  satisfied  with  their  system  of  health 
care;  60  percent  thought  that  it  needed  fundamental  changes,  and  29  percent  believed  it  needed  to  be 
completely  rebuilt.  It  is  not  only  ordinary  Americans  who  are  threatened  by  high  costs;  many  leading 
corporations  contend  they  can  no  longer  pay  for  their  employees’  health  care  and  remain  competitive  in 
the  global  economy.  Many  poorer  Americans,  those  outside  the  economic  mainstream,  have  no  access 
to  medical  insurance  at  all  and  must  rely  on  Medicaid,  a  program  said  by  some  specialists  to  be  headed 
for  bankruptcy  in  a  few  years.  Medicare,  established  for  older  Americans,  appears  on  a  sounder  footing, 
but  in  coming  decades  will  consume  ever  more  of  the  federal  budget. 

Devising  means  to  provide  adequate  medical  care  to  all  Americans  while  controlling  costs  will 
be  one  of  the  most  important  political  issues  of  the  coming  decade.  The  debate  will  have  an  ethical 
component  as  well,  for  the  country  will  probably  have  to  weigh  rationing  medical  care,  not  only  to  the 
elderly,  but  to  the  population  at  large.  Choices  will  be  made  about  the  costs,  both  ethical  and  material, 
of  allocating  great  resources  for  so-called  "heroic"  measures  to  extend  the  lives  of  the  terminally  ill  and 
aged.  Should  money  formerly  spent  on  such  measures  instead  go  for  a  universal  system  of  extensive 
prenatal  care,  for  example? 

The  problems  of  rising  costs,  inadequate  care  for  many,  an  increasingly  aged  society  ever  more 
in  need  of  medical  care,  and  the  increasing  specialization  of  medicine  brought  about  by  scientific  advances 
have  led  some  observers  to  foresee  a  more  comprehensive  system  that  will  make  medical  care  available 


154 


for  all.  Given  America’s  individualistic  traditions,  and  the  lobbying  power  of  the  health  insurance 
industry,  this  system  will  not  necessarily  resemble  European  national  health  plans,  but  is  more  likely  to 
be  set  up  by  individual  states  and  combine  universal  guarantees  of  health  care  with  the  resources  of 
existing  private  health  plans. 

The  social  and  financial  costs  connected  with  large  numbers  of  people  without  sufficient  medical 
care  will  be  the  change  driver  for  this  development.  It  will  be  seen  that  overall  medical  costs  can  be 
reduced  by  an  increased  emphasis  on  preventive  care.  An  extensive  pre-  and  postnatal  program  for  all 
mothers  will  mean  lower  social  expenditures  of  a  corrective  nature  in  the  long  run.  A  greater  knowledge 
of  what  constitutes  health,  rather  than  a  concentration  on  illnesses,  will  make  for  a  healthier  population. 
Many  companies  will  reward  employees  who  have  health-enhancing  habits;  such  an  approach  will  also 
benefit  American  society.  Health  care  for  the  elderly  will,  to  some  extent,  be  rationed.  The  overall 
needs  of  society  will  outweigh  those  of  the  old,  whose  medical  care  in  the  last  few  months  of  their  life 
can  consume  medical  resources  that  would  otherwise  benefit  many  younger  persons. 

Specialists  foresee  a  smaller  number  of  hospitals  and  an  increased  number  of  clinics  offering 
ambulatory  care.  The  first  of  these  small  facilities  appeared  only  in  the  1970s.  By  1990  there  were 
many  thousands  of  them,  and  their  numbers  will  grow  in  the  future.  These  clinics  have  the  advantage 
of  easy  accessibility  for  the  public  and  are  relatively  inexpensive  to  operate  because  they  are  not  equipped 
with  very  expensive  and  specialized  high-tech  equipment.  Medical  technology  of  this  kind  will  be  located 
in  large  regional  hospitals  that  can  treat  illnesses  beyond  the  capacity  of  clinics.  Most  of  these  hospitals 
will  be  owned  and  operated  by  a  few  large  national  firms.  Independent,  locally  owned  institutions  will 
largely  be  a  thing  of  the  past.  Specialists  also  predict  that  in  the  next  century  most  American  doctors  will 
be  salaried  personnel,  working  for  the  few  large  health-care  organizations. 

Values 


Many  observers  see  trends  and  social  phenomena  that  point  toward  an  increasingly  tolerant  and 
pluralistic  society  in  the  America  of  the  next  century.  However  morally  abhorrent  or  distasteful  some 
behavior  may  be  to  most  people,  if  no  definite  moral  or  physical  harm  can  be  proven,  there  seems  to  be 
an  increasing  likelihood  that  it  will  be  permitted.  To  a  degree  unparalleled  in  world  history,  laws  are 
now  in  place  protecting  behavior  that  in  the  recent  past  would  have  been  quickly  repressed  or  hidden 
behind  the  veil  of  hypocrisy. 

Even  the  political  influence  of  the  Moral  Majority  movement  in  the  first  half  of  the  1980s,  could 
not  prevent  the  rise  of  tolerance.  Many  Baby  Boomers  adopted  the  economic  laissez-faire  politics  of  the 
Reagan  administration,  but  these  same  conservative  Baby  Boomers  also  applied  this  live-and-let-live 
philosophy  to  the  private  lives  of  others.  Early  in  the  second  half  of  the  1980s  the  Moral  Majority 
withdrew  from  the  political  arena  and  disbanded  itself. 

The  revolution  in  telecommunications  taking  place  the  last  few  decades  has  affected  values. 
Only  the  most  secluded  American  can  escape  being  confronted  at  every  turn  by  different  ways  of  living 


155 


and  different  attitudes  about  values.  Americans  outside  of  even  the  smallest  town  soon  learn  that  anyone 
they  may  meet  may  hold  opinions  about  morality,  politics,  and  aesthetics  that  are  very  different  from  their 
own.  This  fact  means  that  polite  tolerance  soon  becomes  a  necessity  if  people  are  going  to  deal  with  each 
other  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  This  co-existence  with  others  of  radically  different  mindsets  gradually  brings 
about  the  ability  to  appreciate  a  multiplicity  of  views.  It  also  brings  with  it  the  realization  that  when  there 
are  radically  different  views  about  the  solution  of  common  problems,  creative  methods  must  be  devised 
to  find  mutually  satisfactory  solutions.  The  constant  and  increasing  exposure  of  Americans  to  differing 
belief  systems,  is  causing  more  time  to  be  spent  on  learning  conflict-resolution  techniques,  even  at  the 
grade-school  level.  To  a  greater  degree  than  now,  Americans  of  the  next  century  will  be  skilled  at 
dealing  with  a  wide  range  of  values.  Provinciality  may  well  become  a  thing  of  the  past. [18] 

The  increasingly  complex  and  interconnected  society  of  the  next  century  is  likely  to  engender 
a  new  concern  for  the  welfare  of  all  citizens.  It  may  become  clearer  than  ever  before  that  the  misfortunes 
of  individuals  or  particular  groups  hinder  the  progress  of  society  as  a  whole.  A  feeling  of  shared  destiny 
may  become  the  hallmark  of  American  society.  Environmental  concerns  will  contribute  to  this.  The 
damage  done  to  the  environment  in  earlier,  less  informed  times,  will  be  obvious,  and  the  common  efforts 
and  sacrifices  needed  to  repair  it  and  to  prevent  additional  harm  to  our  common  natural  world,  will  serve 
to  heighten  concern  for  the  welfare  of  society  as  a  whole. 

If  it  does  prove  to  be  the  case  that  the  age  of  superpower  rivalry  is  past,  then  the  United  States 
is  not  likely  to  need  as  large  a  military  establishment  in  the  future  as  it  has  in  the  past.  The  existence  of 
a  smaller  professional  armed  force  is  not  assured,  however,  for  economic  conditions  may  make  such  a 
force  too  expensive.  For  this  reason  it  may  be  necessary  to  reinstitute  a  draft  system.  A  universal  draft, 
possibly  registering  women  as  well  as  men,  would  not  be  seen  as  fair,  however,  for  given  the  large  size 
of  age  cohorts  in  this  country,  most  young  people  would  not  be  inducted  into  military  service.  For  these 
reasons,  it  might  prove  useful  to  establish  a  new  form  of  national  service,  one  with  both  military  and 
civilian  components.  Young  people  could  be  called  up  for  two  years  and  allowed  to  decide  where  they 
would  serve.  Social  work,  rehabilitation  of  the  environment,  or  service  in  a  small  armed  forces  could 
be  among  the  options.  Given  the  fact  that  most  youths  would  not  be  soldiers,  physical  and  mental 
requirements  could  be  set  at  such  a  level  that  virtually  all  young  people,  males  and  females,  even  the 
disabled  and  mildly  retarded,  would  be  involved.  The  term  of  service  could  be  inexpensive,  would 
provide  the  country  with  a  directed  work  force  to  deal  with  problems  of  all  varieties,  would  mix  young 
people  of  all  classes  and  races,  help  inculcate  common  values,  and  would  tap  the  wells  of  idealism 
typically  a  characteristic  of  youth.  [35] 

Religion 


American  society  has  always  been  markedly  religious.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that 
religion  will  not  remain  vitally  important  to  many  Americans  in  the  next  century,  but  is  likely  to  differ 
from  today  in  that  many  smaller  churches  will  have  appeared,  and  some  "faiths,"  like  the  New  Age 


156 


movement,  only  loosely  defined  as  religions,  may  be  widespread.  During  the  1980s,  the  older  established 
churches  lost  members.  In  order  to  retain  their  membership,  they  frequently  relaxed  their  stands  on 
religious  doctrine  or  social  issues,  or  they  gave  way  to  more  radical  groups  within  their  membership. 
Part  of  the  established  churches’  greater  liberality  was  a  reflection  of  a  more  tolerant  mainstream 
America.  The  tensions  that  shifting  values  can  call  forth  within  church  organizations  was  especially 
noticeable  within  the  Roman  Catholic  church.  Since  the  hierarchy  remained  quite  conservative  during 
the  long  papacy  of  John  Paul  II  and  did  moderate  its  doctrinal  positions,  many  of  the  lower  clergy  paid 
only  lip  service  to  their  church’s  stands.  In  private  they  counselled  their  flock  to  follow  their  own 
conscience. 

In  recent  years  mainstream  religions  have  been  the  source  of  much  opposition  to  the  use  of  U.S. 
armed  forces  abroad.  This  trend  is  likely  to  increase  in  the  future,  as  mainstream  religions  become  more 
dominated  by  people  born  after  World  War  II  and  who  therefore  have  never  experienced  a  long  and 
difficult,  but  popularly  supported,  military  intervention  abroad.  The  continued  presence  of  this  opposition 
movement  in  the  churches  is  likely  to  be  less  important  in  the  future  because  wars  are  likely  to  be  short, 
or  involve  few  troops,  or  if  these  conditions  are  not  possible,  will  not  be  waged  unless  wide  public 
support  is  certain. 

Fundamentalist  religions  will  continue  to  play  a  role  in  society,  perhaps  much  as  they  do  today, 
but  this  role  will  continue  be  a  secondary  one,  highly  visible,  but  not  dominant.  The  political  influence 
fundamentalism  enjoyed  in  the  early  1980s  through  the  Moral  Majority  movement  is  unlikely  to  be 
repeated  in  a  increasingly  tolerant  America.  Legal  initiatives  sponsored  by  fundamentalists  are  likely  to 
be  occasionally  successful  on  a  local  or  state  level  but  be  struck  down  by  higher  courts  if  they  abridge 
the  rights  of  others.  The  traditionally  fervent  patriotism  of  fundamentalism  may  well  be  tempered  by  the 
increasing  complexity  and  interconnectedness  of  the  world. 

America  is  still  overwhelmingly  Christian,  but  not  to  the  degree  it  was  formerly.  In  addition 
to  the  long-established  Jewish  population,  most  of  whose  forebears  arrived  in  this  country  before  World 
War  I,  there  has  been  a  more  recent  influx  of  Muslims,  although  many  Americans  of  Arabic  extraction 
are  Christian.  In  the  last  few  decades  many  immigrants  have  come  from  India  and  Asia  and  an  estimated 
one  million  Buddhists  now  live  in  the  United  States.  This  multiplicity  of  old  and  established  religions  will 
also  likely  lessen  the  influence  of  fundamentalism  in  the  future. 

America  has  a  long  history  of  do-it-yourself  religions,  and  this  tradition  will  continue  unabated 
into  the  new  century.  People  will  fashion  religions  of  their  choosing.  As  before,  there  will  be  religions 
that  preach  "feel  good"  messages  and  garner  large,  if  not  solid,  followings.  Some  of  the  new  faiths  will 
not  be  Christian,  but  assemble  a  worldview  out  of  anything  handy.  In  the  1980s,  the  "New  Age"  religion 
(or  is  it  a  life  style?)  attracted  a  good  deal  of  attention.  With  little  mental  or  moral  strain,  but  with  some 
financial  sacrifice,  this  faith  offers  its  followers  advice,  contentment,  physical  health,  and  even  spiritual, 
or  spiritualistic,  excitement.  This  particular  sect  and  others  like  it  may  fade  away  before  the  new  century 
arrives,  but  similar  "faiths"  or  "modes"  will  likely  replace  it.

Lifestyles 


Americans  will  live  somewhat  differently  in  the  next  century,  although  changes  will  be  of 
degree,  rather  than  kind.  The  trend  away  ffom  the  classic  nuclear  family  is  likely  to  continue  (the  results 
of  this  trend  have  been  sketched  out  in  an  earlier  section).  The  most  striking  changes  in  how  Americans 
live,  and  perhaps  the  most  painful,  will  be  connected  with  changes  in  the  ways  they  earn  their  living. 

The  trend  toward  the  new  interconnected  real-time  global  information/service  economy  will 
force  firms  to  adapt  to  changing  business  conditions.  The  new  conditions  will  mean  constantly  evolving 
job  requirements  and  a  highly  flexible  work  force.  Workers  will  change  jobs  often.  An  increasing 
number  of  workers  will  be  hired  via  short-  or  long-term  contracts.  Once  contracts  are  completed, 
workers  will  have  to  secure  new  ones  to  earn  their  livelihood.  Companies  will  become  smaller.  The 
enormous  factories  that  have  dominated  the  manufacturing  sector  since  the  early  Industrial  Revolution 
will  give  way  to  many  smaller  firms  located  in  industrial  parks.  Workplaces  of  this  nature  are  easily 
opened  and  just  as  quickly  shut  down,  making  for  much  employment  insecurity. 

These  trends  will  affect  where  people  live.  The  old  urban  centers  will  continue  to  lose 
population,  while  a  network  of  small  population  clusters  will  spring  up  beyond  the  suburbs  built  in  the 
post-war  era.  Commuting  will  more  often  than  not  be  between  these  new  rural/suburban  centers,  rather 
than  involve  a  long  trek  into  the  core  city.  The  distinction  between  rural  and  urban  will  lose  much  of 
its  importance  and  be  replaced  by  this  mix  of  urban,  suburban,  and  satellite  areas. 

As  much  of  the  work  of  the  new  century  will  be  done  on  computers  that  can  easily  be  connected 
to  one  another  and  to  a  corporate  headquarters,  more  Americans  will  probably  be  working  at  home.  The 
expected  increase  in  the  number  of  self-employed  and  contract  employees  will  also  favor  this  trend  and 
likewise  permit  more  part-time  work,  more  flexible  schedules,  and  make  job-sharing  more  common.  The 
trek  of  large  numbers  of  employees  to  and  ffom  their  workplace  at  the  sound  of  a  whistle  will  be  an 
anachronism. 

An  unfortunate  consequence  of  this  ever-widening  and  thinning  web  of  habitation  will  be  the 
continued  decay  of  the  old  urban  centers  and  the  isolation  of  minority  groups  living  in  them,  trends 
already  well  established  today.  Innovative  social  policies  might  alleviate  the  problems  of  inner  cities,  but 
their  implementation  may  be  difficult  in  the  harsher  economic  conditions  of  the  next  century. 

This  study  assumes  that  the  trend  toward  an  increasingly  tolerant  America  will  continue.  As 
a  result  of  trend,  minority  groups  will  have  a  greater  feeling  of  self-worth  and  increasingly  come  to 
celebrate  their  heritages.  Their  numbers,  the  economic  success  of  a  good  part  of  their  members,  and 
their  greater  self-confidence  may  mean  that  in  regions  where  they  predominate,  their  cultures  will 
flourish.  Examples  of  this  today  are  the  highly  successful  Asian-American  communities  of  California. 

As  the  time  approaches  when  whites  become  one  minority  among  many  (estimated  by  some  to 
occur  around  the  middle  of  the  next  century),  the  country  may  come  to  consist  of  regions  where  one  or 
several  minorities  predominate,  each  with  its  unique  flavor.  The  United  States  could  become,  in  effect, 
the  United  Peoples  of  America.  A  potential  disruptive  aspect  of  this  trend  is  that  it  could  increase 


158 


regionalization  and  might  make  framing  nation-wide  policies  more  difficult  than  it  is  today. 

Retirees  are  another  social  group  that  may  come  to  impose  their  character  upon  certain  regions 
of  the  country.  Large  numbers  of  the  able-bodied  retired  may  also  come  to  dominate  in  more  areas  than 
at  present;  currently  only  Florida  and  Arizona  have  socially  significant  numbers  of  retirees.  These  older 
people,  relatively  affluent,  will  change  the  areas  in  which  they  live  by  the  way  they  spend  their  time  and 
money  and  by  their  social  and  political  concerns. 

A  number  of  major  American  corporations  are  already  preparing  for  the  large  market  of  older 
people  who  will  want  to  live  in  retirement  communities.  This  trend  will  continue,  even  though  retirement 
specialists  have  found  that  most  retirees  remain  in  the  towns  in  which  they  spent  their  working  lives.  A 
new  development  in  this  housing  market,  however,  will  be  the  construction  of  centers  for  older 
Americans  who  can  no  longer  completely  manage  their  own  care.  Until  their  mid-seventies,  most  older 
people  are  self-sufficient;  thereafter,  they  become  ever  more  dependent  on  the  care  of  others.  Some  large 
corporations  are  already  planning  to  meet  the  needs  of  this  population  group. 

Many  older  people  will  be  well-provided  with  housing,  however,  even  having  more  than  they 
need.  Many  will  sell  their  large  homes,  acquired  when  they  were  raising  their  families,  for  something 
smaller.  Many  will  remain  where  they  are  and  perhaps  divide  their  homes  into  several  smaller 
households.  Younger  people  will  likely  find  housing  costs  often  beyond  their  means,  so  a  sharing  of  a 
house  with  some  older  people,  perhaps  their  parents,  is  seen  by  specialists  as  likely  to  become  more 
common  in  the  future.  An  Australian  housing  variant,  the  so-called  "granny  shack,"  that  is,  a  smaller 
dwelling  next  to  the  family  house  to  which  older  people  might  move  after  their  grown  children  start  their 
own  families,  is  also  seen  as  a  likely  trend  in  the  future. 

Retirees  will  often  be  "house-rich"  and  "cash-poor."  A  likely  response  to  this  situation  will  be 
so-called  reversed  mortgages,  by  which  older  people  pledge  their  house  to  a  financial  organization,  to  be 
ceded  upon  death,  in  exchange  for  ready  capital.  Variants  of  the  device  are  being  worked  out  already 
and  will  become  common  in  the  next  century. 

POLITICS 

If  the  Cold  War  does  come  to  an  end  in  the  early  1990s  and,  as  a  result,  the  United  States  is 
not  involved  in  any  serious  large-scale  conflicts,  then  American  politics  in  the  next  decades  will  likely 
center  on  domestic  issues.  The  portion  of  the  budget  going  to  defense  will  decline,  with  funds  instead 
going  for  domestic  purposes.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  the  most  important  domestic  political  issue  will 
be,  in  essence,  international:  namely,  what  political  measures  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  United 
States  is  competitive  in  the  global  economy.  In  short,  the  great  change  driver  in  American  politics  in  the 
coming  decades  will  be  how  this  country  deals  with  the  trend  towards  an  interconnected  world  market. 
Choices  will  be  made  about  how  much  government  intervention  in  economic  affairs  is  permissible  and 
advisable,  how  to  ameliorate  social  ills  that  consume  material  and  human  resources,  how  to  train  and 
educate  Americans  to  prosper  in  the  new  economy,  how  to  improve  the  country’s  infrastructure,  and  how 


159 


to  best  manage  the  aging  of  America,  to  name  only  one  of  this  country’s  most  pressing  future  concerns. 

If,  for  reasons  outlined  above,  the  United  States  becomes  a  more  tolerant  country,  then  racial 
or  ethnic  tensions  will  be  less  a  generation  hence  than  they  are  today.  On  the  other  hand,  economic 
trends  are  likely  to  strengthen  tensions  stemming  from  economic  or  class  differences.  Public  disorders 
growing  out  of  these  tensions  could  be  an  ever-present  danger  if  many  Americans  feel  they  have  not  had 
fair  economic  opportunities.  In  that  case,  resources  would  have  to  be  allotted  to  deal  with  these  potential 
outbreaks  of  violence  and,  as  in  many  other  countries,  the  military  may  have  to  concern  itself  with 
domestic  threats  as  well  as  external  ones. 

Political  parties  will  continue  to  play  key  roles  in  politics  but  they  are  likely  to  be  less  important 
than  they  are  today  and  function  to  a  greater  degree  than  today  as  frameworks  in  which  individual 
politicians  pursue  their  own  objectives.  Party  discipline  has  always  been  weak  in  American  politics. 
Because  the  United  States  has  shunned  the  principle  of  proportional  representation,  making  it  extremely 
difficult  for  small  parties  to  achieve  a  political  foothold,  American  parties  are  to  some  degree  coalitions, 
often  with  members  who  are  ideologically  opposed  to  one  another.  This  lack  of  coherence  in  political 
parties  will  increase  as  problems  become  increasingly  serious.  Innovative  members  of  both  parties  will 
respond  creatively  to  these  problems,  often  forming  coalitions  with  members  of  opposing  parties  to 
achieve  results.  Coalition  formation  is  likely  to  become  an  even  stronger  trend  in  the  future  as  traditional 
America  gradually  fades  away,  to  be  replaced  by  something  new. 

The  coalition  built  by  Roosevelt  may  largely  disappear  in  the  coming  decades.  The  south  is 
already  no  longer  solidly  Democratic,  the  unions  and  their  membership  will  be  fragmented  and 
diminished,  and  minority  voters  are  more  likely  to  approve  policies  that  match  their  individual  place  in 
the  economy  or  society  than  to  vote  in  a  racial  bloc.  Republicans  will  also  have  few  certain  voting 
blocks.  If  the  south  will  no  longer  be  controlled  by  the  Democratic  Party,  it  will  not  be  tied  completely 
to  the  GOP  either.  The  midwest  farm  vote  will  have  vanished  with  the  passing  of  the  small  farm,  and 
agribusiness,  while  rich,  will  not  control  many  votes.  The  millions  of  white  collar  and  new  collar 
workers,  that  is  workers  in  lower  level  service  jobs,  will  be  a  fickle  group,  largely  unpredictable  in  their 
voting  habits.  Also  unpredictable  will  be  the  many  new  entrepreneurs  that  will  emerge  in  the  new 
information/service  society.  Global  in  outlook  out  of  necessity  and  pro-business  because  of  their 
occupations,  they  will  be  liberal  or  at  least  tolerant  in  their  social  attitudes.  A  relatively  peaceful  world 
and  a  reconfigured  Soviet  Union  will  make  anti-communism  seem  quaint  to  them.  Older  Americans  will, 
of  course,  be  a  sizeable  group  in  society.  They  will  have  the  highest  percentage  of  voters  and  a  number 
of  strong  concerns,  notably  pensions  and  health  care,  but  their  attitudes  on  many  issues  are  likely  to  vary 
just  as  much  as  they  do  in  other  age  groups. 

Given  the  economic  rigors  of  the  coming  decades,  some  political  analysts  believe  that  in  the 
future,  American  parties,  or  at  least  segments  of  them,  will  adopt  more  pragmatic  positions  on  social  and 
economic  issues.  The  left/right  clashes  of  earlier  decades  will  seem  less  relevant  in  the  new  century,  and 
the  overriding  importance  of  a  smoothly  functioning  economy  may  submerge  other  issues,  or  cause  them 
to  be  handled  differently.  For  example,  affirmative  action  may  be  gradually  displaced  by  a  policy  of 


160 


creating  opportunities  for  everyone.  The  need  for  almost  everyone  to  be  continuously  retrained  will  mean 
the  establishment  of  education  programs  that  will  address  the  needs  of  all  citizens,  not  just  disadvantaged 
groups  and  the  young.  The  fact  that  nearly  all  Americans  will  feel  the  cool  winds  of  the  new  global 
economy,  that  all  wage-earners,  skilled  and  unskilled  alike,  will  know  economic  insecurity  may  make 
many  former  concerns  seem  parochial  and  allow  new  feelings  of  solidarity  across  the  nation  as  a  whole. 
[39] 

Generations  at  odds 

Given  the  continuance  of  existing  trends,  it  is  possible  that  disputes  between  generations  about 
how  the  country’s  resources  should  be  allocated  will  be  at  the  forefront  of  domestic  politics  in  the  first 
decades  of  the  next  century.  The  prime  concerns  of  older  Americans  will  be  their  pensions  and  their 
health  and  nursing  care.  Younger  Americans  will  be  concerned  about  the  economy,  their  standard  of 
living,  their  prospects  for  the  future,  and  the  education  of  themselves  and  their  children. 

The  largest  lobbying  group  in  the  United  States  in  1991  is  the  American  Association  of  Retired 
Persons.  One  of  its  publications,  Modern  Maturity,  has  a  larger  readership  than  either  Reader’s  Digest 
or  TV  Guide.  Older  people  are  organized,  are  the  most  likely  to  vote  (see  Fig.  2),  and  have  more  people 
their  own  age  in  Congress  than  any  other  group.  Although  older  people  have  good  reasons  for  their 
demands  and  entitlements,  it  is  possible  that  younger  people  will  come  to  believe  that  the  old  take  too 
much  of  the  country’s  finite  resources.  The  ever-worsening  U.S.  dependency  ratio  will  make  meeting 
the  elderly’s  demands  increasingly  difficult  for  the  working  population. 

Disputes  between  the  generations  could  come  to  have  a  racial  or  ethnic  component.  For  the 
coming  decades  at  least,  most  of  older  America  will  be  white.  It  could  eventually  be  the  case  that  an 
older  White  America,  while  willing  to  pay  taxes  for  the  benefit  of  its  own  children,  will  not  be  willing 
to  apply  resources  for  the  education  of  increasing  numbers  of  Hispanic,  Asian,  and  black  children.

Regional  and  Interest  Politics 


It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  politics  on  a  subnational  level  will  come  to  be  more  important  in 
the  next  century.  The  complexity  of  the  tasks  that  political  bodies  will  confront  might  be  more 
manageable  if  town,  state,  and  regional  governments,  rather  than  the  national  government,  deal  with 
them.  For  this  reason,  new  governing  mechanisms  are  likely  to  be  developed,  or,  at  the  very  least, 
existing  governing  bodies  will  be  improved,  to  deal  with  public  issues  in  the  coming  decades. 

In  its  effort  to  develop  a  more  efficient  and  dynamic  society,  the  American  people  will  devise  new 
bodies  to  govern  the  vast  metropolitan  areas  that  already  cut  across  municipal,  county,  and  state 
boundaries.  Greater  Los  Angeles  has  an  economy  that  in  size  exceeds  that  of  many  nations.  The 
Baltimore-Washington  area  will  be  ever  more  closely  interconnected  in  the  next  century.  Greater  New 
York  will  extend  ever  further  outward  from  Manhattan.  The  vast  urbanized  region  extending  from 
Boston  to  Washington  (BosWash)  already  contains  one-sixth  of  the  nation’s  population  on  2.1  percent  of 
its  land,  and  by  2015  will  contain  an  even  larger  share  of  this  country’s  people,  packed  ever  more  densely 
together.  A  counter  trend  to  this  increasing  concentration  in  certain  areas,  generally  along  the  nation’s 
coasts,  will  be  an  emptying  out  of  other  regions,  most  notably  the  rural  areas  of  the  midwest  where  many 
small  towns  are  already  in  the  process  of  disappearing. 

Creating  new  mechanisms  to  govern  these  collections  of  human  beings  will  take  much  political 
energy.  Entrenched  politicians  will  not  want  to  cede  power  to  larger,  overarching  entities.  Inner-city 
politicians  will  not  be  eager  to  share  power  with  suburban  leaders,  who,  in  turn,  will  not  want  to  saddle 
their  districts  with  the  expensive  problems  of  the  core  city.  Governing  entities  will  be  developed  to  deal 
with  the  problems  and  goals  of  the  larger  regions.  Business,  social,  and  environmental  concerns  of  these 
regions  will  be  managed  by  new  regional  governing  bodies  that  will  have  the  power  to  overrule  traditional 
political  bodies.  [15] 

How  far  this  political  reformation  will  extend  is  uncertain.  The  division  of  the  United  States  into 
fifty  states  is  no  longer  particularity  efficient.  Getting  extremely  diverse  states  to  agree  on  common 
policies  is  frequently  impossible.  Arizona  has  little  in  common  with  New  Hampshire,  other  than  both 
are  parts  of  the  United  States.  States  are  frequently  divided  against  themselves.  Flat  eastern  Colorado 
has  very  different  concerns  than  mountainous  western  Colorado.  Northern  Virginia  is  part  of  BosWash, 
unlike  the  state’s  tobacco-growing  counties. 

Forced  by  the  international  economy  to  manage  its  resources  better,  the  United  States  will 
experiment  with  alternative  ways  of  governing  itself.  Perhaps  some  kind  of  Regional  Congress  will  be 
devised,  one  that  has  only  advisory  powers  but  is  able  to  lobby  foreign  firms  for  investments.  This 
Regional  Congress  could  be  the  site  where  regional  parties,  that  is,  parties  bound  together  by  common 
concerns  and  shared  values  and  attitudes,  would  be  active. 

This  possibility  is  not  as  farfetched  as  it  might  first  appear.  For  example,  one  student  of  this 
country,  the  journalist  Joel  Garreau,  divides  the  United  States  into  nine  nations  (see  Fig.  3).  He  includes 
in  this  construction  large  parts  of  Canada,  Mexico,  and  the  Caribbean.  He  sees  North  America  as 


163 


consisting  of  New  England  and  its  extension  into  Canada;  Quebec;  the  Foundry,  often  frequently  referred 
to  as  the  Rust  Bowl;  the  Breadbasket  (central  Canada,  much  of  the  midwest,  and  northern  Texas);  Dixie 
(including  the  eastern  third  of  Texas  and  northern  Florida);  the  Islands  (southern  Florida  and  the 
Caribbean  islands);  Mexamerica  (western  Texas,  New  Mexico,  Arizona,  southern  California,  and  much 
of  Mexico);  the  Empty  Quarter  (mountain  states  and  the  Rockies  in  Canada);  and  Ecotopia  (northern 
California,  Oregon,  Washington,  western  Canada,  and  southern  coast  of  Alaska).  However  crude 
Garreau’s  design,  it  conforms  much  more  closely  to  social  and  economic  realities  than  does  the  current 
political  delineation  of  North  America. 

Some  regions  will  be  more  successful  than  others  in  the  new  century.  Silicon  Valley,  the 
Minneapolis-Saint  Paul  area,  and  greater  Washington  are  likely  to  fare  better  than  the  urban  centers  of 
the  Rust  Belt.  It  is  conceivable  that  successful  areas,  having  much  in  common,  might  join  together  to 
lobby  governing  bodies  for  their  purposes.  With  great  financial  resources  and  the  best  brains  money  can 
buy  at  their  disposal,  a  so-called  High-Tech/Service  Association  would  have  much  success  in  forwarding 
its  interests.  These  areas,  well  connected  to  the  global  economy,  could  have  very  different  domestic  and 
foreign  agendas  than  areas  not  prospering  in  the  next  century. 

Will  prosperous  regions  be  willing  to  help  poorer  regions?  Will  there  be  there  be  a  national 
agency  that  steers  "seed  money"  to  areas  in  distress?  In  the  Brave  New  World  of  the  coming  century, 
will  there  be  a  feeling  that  all  Americans  are  in  the  same  boat,  or  will  a  philosophy  of  Social  Darwinism 
determine  public  policy?  These  are  issues  that  will  set  public  debate  in  the  next  century. 

Television  transformed  American  politics  in  just  a  few  decades.  The  1948  presidential  campaign 
is  said  to  have  been  the  last  in  which  television  played  no  part.  The  computer  information  network 
already  in  existence  is  certain  to  expand  in  the  next  25  years  and  create  what  could  be  called  a 
microelectronic  society  in  which  large  segments  of  the  population  will  be  "in  touch"  electronically  with 
the  larger  world.  For  example,  interest  groups  of  all  stripes  will  carefully  monitor  government  and 
business  decisions  affecting  them  via  large  data  banks  earmarked  to  their  specifications.  Apprised  of  a 
happening  that  affected  it,  an  interest  group  will  inform  its  members  and  take  appropriate  action.  This 
ability  of  immediate  response  to  even  the  slightest  of  events,  will,  in  effect,  give  America  a  "hair  trigger" 
democracy.  [6] 

Interest  groups,  by  their  very  nature,  agitate  for  their  narrow  advantage,  often  at  the  cost  of  the 
common  good.  The  increased  strength  of  well-positioned  groups  in  the  new  century  might  be  countered, 
according  to  a  suggestion  of  Robert  Dahl  of  Yale  University,  by  a  randomly  selected  number  of  citizens, 
perhaps  a  thousand  adults  from  all  walks  of  life,  who  would  in  effect  be  an  "amateur  congress"  that 
would  debate  issues.  By  means  of  computer  information  networks,  this  group  could  be  furnished  with 
data  needed  for  decisions  on  contentious  issues,  and  study,  reflect,  and  finally  decide  in  an  electronic 
town  meeting.  Final  judgements  could  be  passed  on  to  the  appropriate  level  of  government,  local,  state, 
and  national.  If  this  citizens’  congress  did  its  work  well,  its  findings  might  have  considerable  weight.

CONCLUSION 


The  past  25  years  have  seen  numerous  events  that  have  changed  how  people  live.  Oil-price 
shocks,  Japanese  economic  ascendancy,  the  mass  distribution  of  home  computers  and  video,  Germany’s 
unification,  the  moonlanding,  the  women’s  movement,  the  invention  of  the  compact  disc  and  fax  machine, 
the  disappearance  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  live  television  broadcasts  around  the  globe  via  satellite,  the  Third 
World’s  "defeat"  of  the  superpowers  in  Vietnam  and  Afghanistan  are  only  a  few  of  the  developments  of 
this  period  that  have  altered  the  world  in  which  we  live.  There  is  no  reason  to  expect  that  the  next  25 
years  will  not  witness  equally  striking  events. 

The  challenge  posed  to  the  United  States  by  the  ever  more  interconnected  global  economy  will 
cause  great  wrenching  changes  in  the  next  decades.  The  world  of  2015  will  be  a  very  different  world 
from  today’s,  as  will  the  role  the  United  States  will  play  in  it.  The  largely  bi-polar  world  that  existed  for 
a  few  decades  after  World  War  II  will  have  given  way  to  a  multi-polar  world  with  a  variety  of  complex 
political,  economic,  and  strategic  relationships.  American  society,  largely  impervious  to  developments 
outside  its  borders  during  much  of  the  post-war  period,  will  be  increasingly  tied  to  the  rest  of  the  world, 
and  the  lives  of  people  in  small  towns  in  the  Midwest  or  Appalachia  will  be  affected  by  business  choices 
made  in  Europe  or  Asia. 

The  growing  interconnectedness  of  the  world  will  be  the  great  change  driver  in  the  next 
decades.  Its  effects  will  alter  American  society  decisively,  not  always  in  welcome  ways.  Ordinary 
Americans  may  have  to  accept  a  lower  standard  of  living  as  other  countries  take  more  of  the  world’s 
wealth.  The  rigors  of  the  global  economy  will  mean  the  extinction  of  some  segments  of  the  U.S. 
economy,  while  other  branches  will  be  successful  and  grow  in  strength.  Parts  of  the  United  States  will 
prosper,  while  some  regions  will  be  devastated  unless  far-sighted  industrial  policies  are  in  place. 

Efforts  to  improve  U.S.  competitiveness  will  mean  a  substantial  channeling  of  resources  to 
education  and  probably  expanding  its  scope  to  cover  not  only  the  formative  years  but  a  person’s  whole 
working  life.  Maintaining  the  nation’s  physical  infrastructure  will  require  more  attention  if  the  country 
is  to  compete  successfully.  In  addition,  an  aging  population  will  take  ever  more  of  the  nation’s  wealth, 
perhaps  at  a  catastrophic  rate  after  2015.  Unless  the  U.S.  economy  improves  significantly  and  provides 
employment  for  everyone,  or  bold  and  effective  social  measures  are  devised,  this  country’s  already  large 
underclass  may  well  grow  further  and  consume  much  resources  via  inadequate  welfare  and  penal  systems. 
Environmental  concerns  will  also  require  much  of  the  country’s  resources  and,  in  addition,  will  lead  to 
a  greater  regulation  of  how  people  live  and  work. 

Dealing  successfully  with  these  trends  will  require  policy  choices  of  broad  impact.  These 
choices  could  exacerbate  existing  social  tensions  and  engender  a  society  of  hostile  and  mutually 
destructive  groups.  The  unresolved  struggles  between  narrow  interests,  whether  regional,  class,  minority, 
or  generational,  could  come  to  dominate  political  life,  as  could  the  politics  of  resentment  if,  as  is  likely, 
the  economy  worsens  and  no  overarching  positive  solution  to  the  country’s  problems  is  found. 


166 


The  nation’s  military  establishment  will  be  affected  in  the  difficult  years  during  which  the 
United  States  seeks  to  come  to  terms  with  the  highly  competitive  global  economy.  It  will  probably  have 
to  accept  a  smaller  share  of  the  country’s  resources  than  it  has  in  the  past.  The  likely  waning  of  the  Cold 
War  should  make  this  feasible;  a  smaller  military  could  still  guarantee  the  country’s  security  in  a  world 
where  armed  conflict  was  likely  to  be  waged  on  a  limited  scale.  The  military  is  likely  to  be  only  slightly 
affected  by  social  tensions  that  may  appear  in  a  era  of  declining  living  standards  and  painful  economic 
choices.  In  recent  decades,  moreover,  the  U.S.  military  has  shown  that  it  can  create  within  itself  a 
society  marked  by  equality  and  one  that  is,  to  a  greater  degree  than  is  the  case  in  the  society  at  large,  free 
of  racial  and  political  unrest.  In  addition,  the  economic  uncertainty  experienced  by  the  country  at  large 
will  make  a  military  career  attractive  to  talented  youth  from  all  social  groups.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 
TECHNOLOGY 


—  When  technology  is  considered,  it  is  not  enough  to  focus  on  generations  of  hardware 
platforms  (for  example,  tanks,  airplanes).  To  understand  the  state-of-the-art  and  project  future  potential 
of  technological  developments,  it  is  necessary  to  view  technology  in  the  context  of  four  related  concepts: 
hardware,  process,  system,  and  environment. 

—  Identification  of  key  areas  of  current  and  potential  future  progress  cannot  be  made  by 
short  lists  of  general  categories.  It  must  be  done  by  pinpointing  the  very  specific  areas  (which  are  very 
many)  where  progress  is  actually  occurring.  The  Nasa  Thesaurus  (NASA  SP-7064),  containing  many 
thousands  of  listings,  can  be  adapted  as  a  general  guide,  and  areas  of  progress  correlated  to  those  listings 
with  new  items  added  as  necessary  using  the  same  generation  rules  as  NASA. 

—  The  search  for  potentially  useful  (or  critical)  new  developments  should  be  pursued  in 
two  directions--from  general  scientific  developments  worldwide,  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  which 
components  of  Army  equipment  currently  in  use  or  in  development  can  be  improved  (for  example,  better 
sensors,  better  interfaces,  better  effectors,  etc.). 

—  Technology  comes  from  science,  is  developed  and  financed  by  industry,  proliferates 
through  mass  production,  and  feeds  back  to  science  in  financing  the  search  for  continuing  improvements, 
and  in  providing  science  with  better  tools  for  research. 

—  We  are  currently  in  a  period  where  some  developments  in  science  and  technology  are 
undergoing  astoundingly  rapid  change  with  no  immediate  limits,  while  other  developments  are  "bumping 
up"  against  limitations  of  physical  reality. 

—  The  military  plays  a  key  role  in  supporting  developments  in  science  and  technology. 
Efficiency  can  be  added  by  knowledgeable  selection  of  areas  to  support,  with  de-emphasis  of  some 
popular  areas  in  which  the  industry  at  large  is  already  heavily  involved  and  is  doing  a  sufficient  job. 
Increased  emphasis  could  be  focused  on  "orphan  technologies"  that  are  not  currently  popular  but  which 
could  yield  significant  return  for  a  small  investment,  research  areas  that  are  too  expensive  for  individual 
companies,  and  areas  of  basic  research  that  require  not  much  more  than  support  funds  for  individual 
researchers. 

—  The  military  can  play  a  highly  significant  role  in  developing  education  and  training 
technology  for  itself  and  for  the  United  States. 

—  Technology  intelligently  used  is  the  single  most  important  consideration  for  a 
functional  Army  of  the  future.

TECHNOLOGY 


INTRODUCTION 

Definition 

The  term  "technology"  comprises  a  rough  hierarchy  of  four  related  concepts: 

1.  technology  as  hardware,  e.g.  a  tank; 

2.  technology  as  process,  e.g.  the  process  for  manufacture  of  optical  fiber; 

3.  technology  as  system,  e.g.  transportation  system; 

4.  technology  as  environment  -  the  technological  milieu  of  operations  -  the  general 
availability  of  a  particular  caliber  of  munitions,  for  instance,  or  a  weapon,  such  as  the  Kalashnikov  rifle; 
the  availability  of  electrical  power  networks  to  recharge  batteries;  the  availability  of  cheap  and  reliable 
Japanese  microchips  for  use  in  advanced  weapons  systems  in  Desert  Storm,  etc.  The  American  officer 
in  Grenada  who  used  his  AT&T  credit  card  to  call  for  air  support  when  the  regular  military  channels 
were  not  available  used  his  technological  environment  to  good  advantage. 

Awareness  of  the  four  aspects  of  technology  above  is  necessary  to  understanding  any  technology 
application.  No  rigid  boundaries  between  the  concepts  are  necessary,  and  the  way  the  term  "technology" 
is  used  is  then  clear  from  the  context.  Confusion  arises  only  when  the  categories  are  mixed  without 
awareness  of  descriptive  level  and  when  an  attempt  is  made  (usually  unconscious)  to  limit  the  term 
"technology"  to  a  narrower  sense,  excluding  the  other  aspects. 

Reinventing  the  Camel 

A  camel,  some  wag  has  suggested,  is  a  horse  put  together  by  a  committee.  For  some  reason-- 
probably  involving  the  perceived  need  to  focus  research  funds--the  public  is  being  inundated  by 
committee-produced  lists  of  "technologies"  claiming  to  provide  comprehensive  coverage  of  developments 
relevant  to  particular  constituencies.  These  include  a  list  of  15  items  issued  by  the  United  States 
Department  of  Commerce  (Emerging  Technologies:  A  Survey  of  Technical  and  Economic  Opportunities. 
Spring  1990): 

advanced  materials,  advanced  semiconductor  devices,  superconductors,  flexible  computer 
integrated  manufacturing,  artificial  intelligence,  high-performance  computing,  advanced 
semiconductor  devices,  optoelectronics,  digital  imaging,  sensor  technology,  high-density  data 
storage,  biotechnology,  midical  devices  and  diagnostics, 
and  a  list  of  22  items  issued  by  the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  (Critical  Technologies  Plan.  15 
March  1990): 


172 


composite  materials,  semiconductor  materials  and  microelectronic  circuits,  superconductors, 
machine  intelligence  and  robotics,  softrware  producibility,  photonics,  parallel  computer 
architectures,  data  fusion,  signal  procesing,  passive  sensors,  sensitive  radars,  simulation  and 
modeling,  computational  fluid  dynamics,  biotechnology  materials  and  processes,  air-breathing 
propulsion,  high  energy  density  materials,  hypervelocity  projectiles,  pulsed  power,  signature 
control,  weapon  system  environment. 

The  Army  has  its  own  list  of  13  "Key  Emerging  Technologies"  (Army  Technology  Base  Master 
Plan.  2d  ed.,  November  1990): 

advanced  propulsion,  advanced  signal  processing  and  computing,  artificial  intelligence, 
biotechnology,  low  observables,  micro-electronics/photonics/acoustics,  neuroscience,  power 
generation/storage/conditioning,  protection/lethality,  robotics,  space  technology,  advanced 
materials/materials  processing, 

and,  to  cap  it  all.  The  White  House’s  distinguished  National  Critical  Technologies  Panel  of  13  luminaries 
(that  leaves  just  987  points  of  light  elsewhere  in  the  nation)  has  just  issued  an  annotated  list  of  22 
"National  Critical  Technologies"  (Report  of  the  National  Critical  Technologies  Panel.  March  1991):

composites,  high-performance  metals  and  alloys,

signal  processing,  data  storage  and  peripherals,  computer  simulation  and  modeling, 
BIOTECHNOLOGY  AND  LIFE  SCIENCES  -  applied  molecular  biology,  medical  technology,

The  lists  are  quite  different.  Despite  the  fact  that  two  lists  contain  very  similar  or  even  identical 
categories,  the  other  categories  in  the  lists  make  it  clear  that  they  in  fact  include  different  subcategories. 
The  Army  list  has  the  category  "advanced  materials/materials  processing,"  while  The  White  House 
compilation  includes  "materials  synthesis  and  processing,"  and  the  Department  of  Commerce  has 
"advanced  materials,"  (DOD  has  "composite  materials").  Sound  similar?  The  White  House  list  has 
separate  categories  for  "ceramics,"  "composites,"  and  for  "high-performance  metals  and  alloys,"  all  of 
which,  along  with  "advanced  materials,"  are  subcategories  under  "materials."  The  Department  of 
Commerce  has  separate  categories  for  "advanced  materials"  and  "superconductors,"  (also  a  separate 
category  in  the  DOD  list).  The  Department  of  Defense  has  a  joint  category  for  "semiconductor  materials 
and  microelectronic  circuits"  that  compounds  the  confusion. 

The  list  makers  are  quite  aware  of  each  other’s  lists,  and  even  try  to  provide  category  equivalence 
comparisons  ("Table  2"  in  The  White  House  list,  for  example).  This  Table,  with  the  "Army  Key 
Emerging  Technologies"  added,  is  shown  as  Fig.  1.  The  Army  provides  the  most  exhaustive  "crosswalk" 
between  its  list  and  the  DOD  list  (see  Fig.  2),  quite  correctly  matching  its  own  "advanced 
materials/material  processing"  category  with  the  following  categories  on  the  DOD  list:  "composite 
materials,"  "semiconductor  materials  and  microelectronic  circuits,"  "superconductors,"  "photonics," 
"passive  sensors,"  "biotechnology  materials  and  processes,"  "air-breathing  propulsion,"  high-energy 
density  materials,"  "hypervelocity  projectiles,"  "pulsed  power,"  and  "signature  control."  Note  the 
inclusion  of  biological  materials  as  "advanced."  (And  why  not?) 

What  is  one  to  do  with  all  of  these  "technologies?"  One  answer  is  to  treat  them  as  separate 
technologies.  Some  researchers  have  gone  so  far  as  simply  to  add  the  lists  together  and  characterize  each 
category  as  a  separate  "technology,"  listing  its  source/agent,  potential  use,  milestones,  and  risk/feasibility 
factors.  Aside  from  the  questionable  validity  of  assigning  a  single  feasibility  factor  to  advances  in 
"microelectronics/photonics/acoustics,"  which  is,  in  fact,  not  a  single  technology  but  a  mixed  category 
of  many  different  technologies,  the  additive  mixing  of  lists  clearly  introduces  enormous  redundancy  and 
destroys  all  categorization. 

Some  large  areas  are  omitted  from  each  list.  Only  the  Army  had  the  political  courage  to  include 
"space  technology,"  for  example.  The  White  House  Panel  specifically  and  intentionally  excludes  manned 
space  exploration,  implying  that  it  "does  not  enhance  national  security  and  economic  competitiveness," 
a  very  questionable  judgement  in  itself.  Paradoxically,  the  panel  equivocates  that 

space  exploration  will  continue  to  stimulate  a  broad  range  of  advances  in  both  aerospace 
and  non-aerospace  industries,  contributing  to  our  ability  to  compete  in  the  high- 
technology  global  marketplace.  [10] 

The  Panel  states  that  "there  are  other  national  goals  not  addressed  in  this  report. "  Why  not? 
Which  areas  of  technological  advancement  (besides  manned  spaceflight)  will  not  enhance  national  security 
and  competitiveness?  It  omits  fusion  energy  as  too  long-term,  and  "signature  control"  as  "important  but 
restricted."  Oddly  enough,  though,  in  the  description  of  the  "materials"  section,  the  very  first  desired 


175 


category  includes  "more  ’stealthy’  aircraft  structures,"  an  item  that  could  certainly  be  termed  "signature 
control."  In  the  "Ceramics"  section,  it  focuses  on  "military /aerospace"  designs  and  specifically  mentions 
the  Space  Shuttle  tiles.  Nothing  is  really  omitted  in  the  sense  of  one  not  being  able  to  place  a  particular 
development  in  a  category  (unless  one  mentions  the  specifically  exluded  words  "signature  control"  or 
"nuclear  fusion"--they  can  be  added  under  other  categories). 

Any  one  of  the  lists  will  suffice  for  a  category  breakdown  (some  lists  better  than  others)  if  the 
category  designations  are  considered  just  that--category  designations  in  a  comprehensive,  all-encompassing 
scheme,  into  which  one  may  insert  critical  advanced  developments  as  they  are  identified  now  or  in  the 
future.  In  that  sense,  the  real  Key  Emerging  Technologies  would  be  items  like  "advances  in  optical 
masking  techniques  below  .5  micron  line  separation,"  not  "microcircuit  design,"  or  "microelectronics," 
and  certainly  not  "microelectronics/photonics/acoustics."  The  latter  is  quite  acceptable  as  a  general 
category,  as  long  as  the  actual  "emerging  technology"  items  are  specifically  identified.  This  "specific 
identification"  process  should  be  the  ongoing  task  of  a  competent  group  of  research  analysts  within  the 
Army  in  order  to  see  where  the  advances  lie. 

Of  course,  a  better  general  category  scheme  may  well  be  possible  for  the  next  edition,  designed 
as  a  categorization  scheme  rather  than  as  a  scheme  designating  whole  large  areas  as  "critical"  while 
omitting  decent  categories  for  significant  developments  in  areas  that  are  not  properly  covered. 

How  should  the  categorization  proceed?  In  two  directions:  equipment  based  and  science-based.  Any 
specific  developments  relevant  to  equipment  described  in  the  Army  Technological  Base  Master  Plan  that 
would  significantly  improve  the  functionality,  deployability,  etc.  of  that  equipment  should  be  so 
identified.  At  that  point  developments  in  the  technological  environment  or  scientific  research  that  suggest 
new  equipment,  new  applications,  new  missions,  or  new  developments  in  the  potential  "weapons 
environment"  should  also  be  identified.  The  list  of  "key  technologies"  should  be  quite  large  and 
constantly  monitored  for  new  developments,  with  items  added  and  dropped  constantly  as  the  technological 
environment  progresses.

GENESIS  OF  TECHNOLOGY  (THE  SCI-TECH  ENGINE) 


Technology  is  generated  from  science  and  resources.  Science  provides  the  knowledge  that  a 
particular  development  may  be  possible,  whereupon  someone  who  needs  that  development  for  enrichment 
or  defense  invests  in  the  engineering  needed  to  produce  a  technological  product.  The  vindication  of  the 
scientific  research  through  a  successful  product  then  leads  to  further  investment  in  the  science  in  the  hope 
of  producing  more  knowledge  that  can  be  used  in  the  same  way.  Alternatively,  the  need  for  a  particular 
product  (e.g.  AIDS  vaccine),  impels  the  application  of  resources  to  science  in  the  hope  of  finding  a 
knowledge  framework  from  which  the  product  can  be  developed  by  use  of  more  resources.  The  term 
"resources"  includes  manpower  (trained,  staff  and  management),  site,  materials,  training,  etc.,  most  of 
which  can  usually  (though  not  always)  be  purchased  through  proper  funding.  The  silent  third  partner  in 
the  enterprise  (in  addition  to  science  and  resources)  is,  of  course,  luck,  since  there  are  rarely  any  absolute 
guarantees  that  a  particular  effort  will  pay  off. 

Science  is  also  funded  for  "pure  knowledge"  -  the  propensity  of  human  beings  to  want  to  know 
about  the  nature  of  things  -  but  the  scientist,  for  all  his  (or  her)  protestations  of  purity, 
often  drags  out  the  carrot  of  "technological  fallout"  possibilities  deriving  from  pure  research  as  the  reason 
for  further  funding.  And  not  without  cause,  since  in  the  finai  account  there  is  no  technological  progress 
without  prior  progress  in  science,  and  one  never  knows  when  a  mother  lode  of  technological  implications 
will  be  struck  by  an  unsuspecting  "pure"  researcher. 

Whatever  one’s  view  of  the  importance  of  pure  science  may  be,  the  successful  sales  of  developed 
products  (to  civilians  or  to  governments)  have  been  a  critical  driver  -  "force  multiplier"  for  science  and 
therefore,  in  turn,  for  technology  as  well,  particularly  for  development  of  unforeseen  technologies. 

Another  "force  multiplier"  for  science  has  been  the  improvement  of  existing  instruments  and  the 
development  of  new  ones.  It  is  here  that  technology  provides  direct  feedback  to  science  by  providing 
sensors  which  can  see  further,  magnify  more,  detect  smaller  and  smaller  energy  fields,  etc.,  and 
"effector"  devices  that  produce  higher  speeds,  higher  pressures,  higher  energies,  etc.,  which  then  allow 
the  scientist  to  understand  more  and  more  of  the  physical  (including  the  biological)  universe.  Some  of 
that  knowledge  inevitably  winds  up  suggesting  more  technological  possibilities,  so  the  "force  multiplier" 
again  feeds  back  to  technology,  which  explains  the  current  explosive  growth  in  both  science  and 
technology. 

Unfortunately,  this  rapid  rate  of  technological  progress  is  not  necessarily  permanent  because  it 
presupposes  two  conditions  that  currently  exist  but  may  not  (and  probably  will  not)  exist  indefinitely  to 
the  same  extent.  The  first  condition  is  that  scientists  must  be  aware  that  there  is  something  they  don’t 
know  but  are  potentially  capable  of  finding  out.  The  second  condition  is  that  the  technology  necessary 
for  them  to  "try  and  find  out"  must  be  feasible.  In  the  latter  part  of  the  nineteenth  century,  for  instance, 
Newtonian  physics  reigned  supreme,  and  it  was  quite  a  reasonable  assumption  that  most  further  progress 
in  physics  would  involve  calculation  of  the  same  set  of  constants  to  more  and  more  decimal  places. 
Relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  changed  all  that,  electronics  arrived  on  the  scene  to  provide 


178 


instrumentation,  and  the  exciting  state  of  "uncertainty"  in  science,  with  new  knowledge  arriving  daily, 
was  the  result.  This  condition  prevails  now.  By  the  year  2015  the  same  state  should  still  prevail  because 
the  available  technology  (superconductive  supercollider,  for  instance,  plus  many  many  other  existing  and 
potential  tools)  will  not  by  any  means  have  been  exhausted  for  research.  We  cannot  say  with  any  degree 
of  confidence,  however,  that  progress  will  continue  at  the  same  rate  in  the  year  2090. 

It  is  critical  to  note  here  that  progress  does  not  proceed  at  the  same  rate  for  different  technologies 
even  in  this  time  of  unprecedented  acceleration.  There  are  mature  technologies  and  rapidly  changing 
technologies,  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  military  procurement  (mil.  spec,  doctrine,  in  particular)  these 
require  different  approaches.  In  the  civilian  sector  technological  change  has  often  been  maintained 
(though  not  always  accelerated)  by  means  of  "planned  obsolescence"  and  gradual  introduction  of  features 
into  a  series  of  product  "generations."  Annual  changes  in  the  automobile  are  an  obvious  example.  Cars 
that  would  last  a  long  time  would  delay  introduction  of  new  technology  into  the  marketplace  (although 
sometimes  features  are  withheld  intentionally  so  as  to  have  something  new  for  the  next  year’s  model). 
This  practice,  however,  can  become  extremely  wasteful  in  a  mature  technology.  Razor  blades,  for 
instance,  can  be  made  to  last  much  longer,  but  then  there  would  be  a  much  smaller  market  for  razor  blade 
manufacturers.  The  implications  for  military  procurement  are  that  in  a  mature  technology  the  mil.  spec, 
approach  must  stress  durability  to  attain  quality  and  savings  over  time,  while  in  a  rapidly  changing 
technology  one  may  be  better  off  selecting  low  cost  and  flexibility/adaptability  as  more  primary  (given 
sufficient  operational  quality)  so  that  one  is  not  stuck  with  expensive  obsolete  items  that  never  wear  out. 
"Black  box"  replacement  of  technology  components  is  a  good  approach  here. 

The  third  "force  multiplier"  for  science  and  for  technology  (both  separately  and  together  - 
therefore  with  fourfold  effect)  has  been  and  continues  to  be  the  increasing  development  and  increasing 
general  availability  of  more  and  more  powerful  computers. 

In  science  computers  play  two  separate  functions.  First,  they  allow  more  and  more  precise  and 
rapid  calculation  of  experimental  results.  Second,  they  are  used  to  carry  out  "modeling"  experiments, 
in  which  computations  replace  actual  physical  equipment.  Both  allow  experiments  to  be  carried  out  that 
would  be  otherwise  impractical,  or  even  impossible. 

In  technology,  they  enable  tools  and  equipment  (including  scientific  instruments  -  another  "force 
multiplier")  to  be  faster,  more  powerful,  and,  finally,  more  "intelligent"  and  enable  production  plants  for 
the  instruments  and  equipment  to  be  themselves  more  efficient  and  more  powerful,  with  robotic 
components.  Product  design  is  now  routinely  done  with  computer  (CAD)  tools,  which  are  not  only  faster 
in  calculations  and  routine  tasks,  but  make  it  possible  to  design  products  (complex  microchips,  for 
instance)  that  it  would  be  highly  impractical  to  do  without  CAD  tools.  The  development  of  computers 
is  also  currently  in  an  explosive  phase,  likely  to  carry  way  beyond  2015. 

Military  technology  has  not  only  benefited  greatly  from  this  burgeoning  explosion  of  science  and 
technology  but  also  has  spearheaded  the  cutting  edge  of  technology-supersonic  flight,  the  atom  bomb, 
space  travel,  computing  at  NSA,  etc. -although  it  must  be  pointed  out  that  the  science  was  rarely 
INITIATED  by  the  military.  As  Martin  van  Creveld  points  out: 


179 


None  of  the  most  important  devices  that  have  transformed  war-from  the  airplane  through 
the  tank,  the  jet  engine,  radar,  the  helicopter,  the  atom  bomb,  and  so  on  all  the  way  to 
the  electronic  computer-owes  its  origins  to  a  doctrinal  requirement  laid  down  by  people 
in  uniform.  (Technology  and  War.  1989) 


In  the  recent  technological  tour-de-force,  Operation  Desert  Storm,  in  which  a  major  war  was 
fought  with  essentially  zero  casualties,  except  for  the  unfortunate  impact  of  one  scud  missile  (the  effect 
of  which  can  be  reasonably  labeled  collateral  damage)  and  effects  of  friendly  fire  (the  latter  having 
potential  technological  fixes  for  2015),  the  casualties  were  of  an  order  of  magnitude  that  could  reasonably 
be  expected  during  a  peacetime  exercise  (for  the  time  and  the  number  of  men  involved)  because  of 
intelligent  application  of  superior  technology  and,  one  should  admit,  a  little  bit  of  luck.  The  United 
States  population  is  very  sensitive  to  casualties.  The  death  of  even  one  individual  is  considered  tragic, 
and  we  have  at  times  even  sacrificed  major  foreign  policy  interests  in  the  cause  of  recovering  the  remains 
of  our  kia’s.  Now  that  Desert  Storm  has  shown  that  technology  can  provide  a  dramatic  reduction  in 
casualties  (which  was  not  at  all  as  clear  before  Desert  Storm),  political  support  for  casualty-reducing 
measures  should  not  be  hard  to  get  and  may  even  be  mandated  by  the  public.  The  argument  that  "we 
already  have  enough"  can  be  countered  by  the  fact  that  the  next  enemy  will  not  be  as  vulnerable  to 
surprise  elimination  of  their  air  assets  because  of  their  very  knowledge  of  our  capabilities,  and  that  we 
must  forge  ahead  in  electronic  warfare  to  maintain  the  edge,  as  well  as  in  electronic  (IFF)  measures  to 
reduce  friendly-fire  casualties,  which,  of  course  are  the  most  tragic. 

LIMITS  TO  TECHNOLOGICAL  PROGRESS 

Like  everything  else,  technology  has  definite  limits  on  its  development,  some  of  which  are  pretty 
formidable.  It  can  be  said  with  reasonable  confidence  that  the  efficiency  of  energy  utilization,  say,  of 
gasoline  in  an  internal  combustion  engine,  can  never  exceed  100  percent  (laws  of  physics  say  that  it  can 
never  even  attain  100%),  so  that  the  amount  of  improvement  will  likely  reach  a  limit  reasonably  soon, 
beyond  which  it  does  not  pay  much  to  chisel  away  at  that  limit  (nor  can  the  weight  of  the  car  be  reduced 
below  "zero  pounds"  to  compensate).  This  fact,  of  course,  does  not  mean  that  more  efficient  engine 
designs  are  not  a  top  priority,  given  the  massive  scale  of  their  use,  the  pollution  concomitant  to 
inefficiency,  and  the  exhaustion  of  non-renewable  petroleum.  In  the  area  of  funding,  the  resources 
allocated  to  science  in  the  United  States  right  after  the  first  Soviet  Earth  satellite  Sputnik  I  was  launched 
grew  for  a  while  at  an  annual  rate  which  would  lead  expenditures  on  science  to  exceed  the  gross  national 
product  in  about  15  years  -  another  unfortunate  absurdity.  Chemical  processes  such  as  those  occurring 
in  rocket  fuels  and  explosives  cannot  yield  much  more  energy  than  they  do  now.  The  speed  of  light  is 
likewise  a  physical  limit  that  now  impacts  a  good  number  of  technologies.  Physics  tells  us  that  it  cannot 
be  exceeded. 

One  must  be  careful  with  theoretical  limits,  however.  For  instance,  about  three  decades  ago  it 


180 


could  easily  be  proven  that  the  computer  sitting  on  your  desk  right  now  (or  on  your  lap,  for  that  matter) 
is  completely  impossible.  If  vacuum  tubes  or  even  the  newly  invented  transistors  could  be  developed  so 
that  only  one  in  a  thousand  would  fail  per  year,  a  rate  that  seemed  rather  optimistic,  a  computer 
containing  365,000  tubes  (or  transistors)  would  be  absolutely  sure  to  fail  and  require  repair  every  day 
(never  mind  the  miniaturization  that  would  be  required  to  put  such  a  beast  on  your  desk).  When  we 
remember  that  now  a  single  microchip  frequently  contains  several  million  transistors,  that  chip  alone 
should  fail  at  least  once  an  hour,  and  60  of  those  chips  should  fail  like  clockwork  once  a  minute.  An 
impeccable  argument  in  theory,  but  its  consequences  are  fortunately  averted  by  the  absolutely  incredible 
reliability  of  our  microminiaturized  devices.  This  is  not  to  say  that  another  limit  of  this  kind  cannot 
eventually  bar  further  progress,  but  we  are  nowhere  near  it  now  in  computer  development. 

A  current  example  of  a  technology  bumping  up  against  the  speed  of  light  is  the  increase  in 
computer  processing  (or  "clock")  speed.  Every  computer  has  a  timing  mechanism  which  ensures  that 
things  happen  together  in  a  certain  order.  Essentially,  an  electric  pulse  is  sent  to  all  the  parts  of  the 
computer,  ordering  some  to  be  turned  on  and  some  to  be  turned  off  at  exactly  the  right  time  for  the 
processing  to  continue.  The  early  Apple  computer  was  clocked  at  about  one  Megahertz,  which  means 
that  a  pulse  was  sent  out  once  every  millionth  of  second.  At  the  speed  of  light  this  pulse  travels  about 
300  meters  before  the  next  pulse  is  issued  (actually,  in  a  wire,  electrical  pulses  travel  a  little  slower),  so 
that  all  the  functional  parts  of  the  computer  that  need  to  be  synchronized  are  "clocked"  at  about  the  same 
time,  relatively  speaking.  The  early  IBM  PC  was  clocked  at  4.77  MHz,  which  is  about  five  times  faster, 
and  the  current  PC’s  run  at  over  33  MHz,  which  is  over  thirty  times  faster.  The  rate  of  increase  in  this 
speed  of  the  central  processing  unit  was,  therefore,  about  doubled  every  two  years.  If  "progress"  were 
to  continue  at  the  same  rate,  in  2015  each  pulse  would  travel  only  about  a  centimeter  during  one  cycle, 
and,,  therefore,  to  trigger  all  parts  of  a  computer  "simultaneously,"  the  whole  computer  would  have  to 
be  MUCH  smaller  than  a  centimeter.  In  2030,  the  computer  would  have  to  be  so  small  as  to  be  invisible! 
Rather  tough  on  keyboard  design!  This  is  not  to  say  that  other  technologies  (optical  computers,  for 
instance)  and  other  computer  architectures  (for  example,  parallel  processing),  may  not  extend  the  effective 
processing  rate  to  much  higher  limits.  Parallel  processing,  which  divides  the  computing  task  into  subtasks 
handled  simultaneously  by  semi-independent  microchip  computers  connected  together  in  arrays  with 
successive  array  layers  handling  the  results  of  the  preceding  array  of  component  microcomputers,  is 
clearly  the  wave  of  the  future  in  overcoming  the  speed  limitation  of  architectures  based  on  a  single  central 
processing  unit.  Most  major  computer  companies  are,  in  fact,  working  on  such  designs,  and  some  of 
them  are  already  in  use. 

Other  limits  to  technological  development  are  the  availability  of  trained  personnel  for  all  phases  - 
scientists,  engineers,  and  equipment  operators/specialists,  and,  of  course,  funding,  with  competing 
priorities  for  painfully  limited  resources. 

"The  inventory  that  matters  most  walks  home  every  day  after  work,"  says  Paul  Saffo,  a  research 
fellow  of  the  Institute  for  the  Future  in  Menlo  Park,  California.  In  his  "Looking  Ahead"  column  for  the 
April  10,  1991  edition  of  The  Los  Angeles  Times.  Saffo  raises  the  issue  of  the  feared  "professional  gap" 


181 


in  the  United  States:  the  declining  number  of  Americans  completing  advanced  degrees  in  technical  areas 
that  could  cripple  U.S.  high-tech  competitiveness.  This  "gap",  he  points  out,  failed  to  materialize  in  the 
1980s,  despite  the  fact  that  the  proportion  of  foreigners  earning  graduate  degrees  in  the  United  States  (for 
example,  in  computer  science)  jumped  from  32  to  45  percent  in  the  1977-87  period.  No  real  shortage 
developed  because  many  of  these  graduates  elected  to  stay  and  work  in  the  United  States  where  they  had 
better  opportunities  to  work  "on  the  cutting  edge  of  their  profession." 

Nevertheless,  the  generation  of  scientists  and  engineers  that  entered  the  work  force  in  the  1950s 
and  1960s  will  be  retiring  within  the  next  decade,  causing  overall  retirement  rates  to  increase  by  15 
percent.  This  condition,  combined  with  the  declining  graduate  school  enrollments  in  the  sciences  and 
engineering  and  increased  demand  for  scientists  and  engineers  could,  in  fact,  result  in  a  serious  shortage 
of  skilled  professional  personnel  needed  to  maintain  our  high-tech  edge.  This  situation  could  cause  even 
our  own  companies  to  move  abroad  in  order  to  remain  competitive. 

"Headhunters"  from  abroad  (for  example  Japan  and  Taiwan)  are  already  trying  to  lure  technical 
personnel  from  the  United  States,  particularly  nationals  of  the  country  involved.  Because  the  salaries  they 
offer  are  quite  competitive,  the  question  why  there  is  no  greater  exodus  must  be  adressed. 

One  possible  answer  is  that  the  research  climate  in  the  United  States  favors  the  creative  individual 
rather  than  the  docile  team  player  (as  in  Japan),  so  that  our  best  bet  is  to  continue  to  foster  a  research 
environment  in  which  the  brilliant  "mavericks"  from  all  over  the  world  will  continue  to  settle  in  the 
United  States  regardless  of  salaries  they  could  earn  in  their  native  countries.  The  salaries  do  matter,  of 
course,  particularly  for  retention  of  the  more  "routine"  elements  of  the  scientific  work  force.  Mavericks 
alone  cannot  get  the  entire  job  done.  They  need  support  staff. 

Despite  what  appeared  to  be  great  initial  promise,  educational  technology  has  not  really 
progressed  as  expected.  Exceptions  to  this  are  military-sponsored  efforts  such  as  flight  trainers,  etc.,  but 
in  the  environment  at  large,  educational  technology  is  still  largely  limited  to  "computers  imitating  paper" 
and  "talking-head"  analog  video  presentations.  One  reason  behind  this  is  the  cost  of  software 
development,  which,  unlike  the  case  of  personal-computer  writing-tool  and  business  software,  has  not 
been  amortized  by  a  mass  market,  and  there  is,  in  fact,  no  widespread  realization  that  the  resources 
required  to  develop  educational  software  are  as  great  as  for  any  other  software.  Nevertheless,  the 
potential  remains.  There  is  now  equipment  available  for  communication  to  a  vast  audience  (personal 
computers,  broadcast  and  cable  channels,  etc.),  although  the  proper  presentation  methods  for  interactive 
training  have  not  really  progressed.  The  timetable  for  such  progress  is,  unfortunately,  impossible  to 
estimate  because  no  breakthroughs  are  visible  in  the  near-term.  Educators  will  continue  to  bemoan 
television  while  doing  nothing  to  improve  programming.  It’s  not  their  fault,  however,  as  they  never 
really  had  access  to  resources  even  minimally  adequate  to  the  task  (witness  the  millions  of  dollars  it  takes 
to  develop  a  single  commercial  program  for  personal  computers). 

Education  deficiencies  place  limits  on  technological  progress  by  limiting  the  number  of  future 
scientists  and  engineers  produced  in  this  country  (if  the  economic  climate  is  favorable,  we  may  still  attract 
scientists  from  abroad),  limiting  the  capabilities  of  the  work  force  (already  so  limited),  and  limiting  the 


182 


sophistication  of  the  voting  public  in  determining  productive  policies.  Unfortunately,  the  voting  public, 
unlike  the  scientific  elite,  cannot  be  improved  by  immigration  except  in  the  very  long  term.  The  military, 
with  specific  training  requirements,  may  well  be  the  ones  to  find  the  most  efficient  path  to  educational 
software  and  systems  development.  Among  the  obvious  guidelines  for  progress  is  the  use  of 
communications  media  employing  the  strengths  of  that  media,  rather  than  imitation  of  former  patterns 
(much  as  the  early  motion  pictures  imitated  the  stage).  Unfortunately  such  progress  cannot  be  forced, 
and  we  shall  have  to  wait  for  ingenious  educational  use  of  our  powerful  new  media. 

With  regard  to  resource  limitations  on  the  funding  of  science  and  technology,  despite  the 
somewhat  faddish  nature  of  favored  support  areas  because  of  public  hyper-enthusiasm  when  potential 
applications  are  announced  and  quick  boredom  if  ultimate  results  are  not  instantly  available,  the  "system" 
of  government-industry-academic  research  and  development  has  worked  relatively  well.  This  is  why  we 
are  still  ahead  of  the  world  in  many  of  the  basic  scientific  developments,  particularly  in  areas  where  there 
is  a  national  consensus  on  need  and  where  established  areas  of  research  are  accepted  as  essential.  The 
downside,  which  is  hard  to  avoid,  is  the  necessity  for  basic-area  researchers  to  devote  a  great  deal  of  their 
time  scrambling  for  annual  funding.  A  research  funding  cycle  of  at  least  two  years  would  be  a  great 
improvement. 

The  role  of  military  sponsorship  in  basic  research  has  been  critical  in  many  areas  of  science  and 
technology,  despite  misperceptions  on  the  part  of  a  small  proportion  of  the  public  that  it’s  all  going 
towards  lethality  (in  fact  most  such  research  has  been  of  general  benefit  and  produced  vast  improvements 
in  communications,  space  and  environmental  research).  Some  in  the  military  may  object  in  the  other 
direction,  that  perhaps  resources  should  be  more  focused  on  lethality  issues.  A  rational  middle  position 
here  should  be  a  clear  focus  on  the  needs  of  the  military  as  a  system,  with  continual  monitoring  of  which 
system  components  need  improvement  and/or  can  be  improved  through  newly  available  technology.  The 
use  of  components  available  in  the  general  environment  whenever  possible,  rather  than  mil.  spec, 
everything  to  narrow  and  often  limited  or  unrealistically  high  specifications  could  also  cut  costs  if  the 
planning  is  carefully  done.  The  somewhat  random  and  chaotic  focus  of  the  general  research  environment 
could  be  offset  by  the  military  focusing  on  "orphan  technologies,"  areas  of  potential  improvement  that 
are  not  being  pursued  because  of  absence  of  public  focus.  Other  areas  that  are  identified  as  heavily 
researched  by  industry  for  its  own  needs  could  be  de-emphasized  by  military  research  planners,  even  if 
there  may  be  "glamor"  in  a  particular  research  area. 

The  question  of  support  of  the  industrial  base  by  the  military  looms  large,  particularly  in  a  period 
that  begins  with  an  apparently  inevitable  serious  downsizing  of  the  military  establishment.  Support  for 
advanced  research  only,  per  se.  is  not  necessarily  sufficient.  Someone  actually  has  to  manufacture  the 
equipment  in  a  timely  fashion,  particularly  if  the  need  arises  for  rapid  mobilization.  Experience  has 
shown  that  in  our  system  there  really  should  be  more  than  one  source  of  procurement,  otherwise  there 
is  no  objective  way  to  control  either  product  cost  or  quality.  If  production  lines  are  shut  down  and  teams 
disbanded,  we  may  face  the  same  problems  that  emerged  after  the  accident  that  destroyed  the  Challenger 
space  shuttle.  The  absence  of  unmanned  launch  vehicles  such  as  the  Saturn  to  launch  satellites  critical 


183 


to  national  security  became  painfully  obvious,  and  there  was  no  way  to  revive  Saturrn--even  its  plans 
were  apparently  lost.  On  the  other  hand,  we  cannot  afford  to  keep  everyone  funded.  The  delicate 
balance  that  seems  to  obtain  between  contract  awards  to  Lockheed  and  Boeing  surely  represents  one 
sensible  approach. 

What  happens  when  an  entire  industry  moves  abroad,  which  happened  to  much  of  the  U.S.  steel 
industry,  our  consumer  electronics  industry,  and  tool-and-die  making,  and  there  is  no  one  to  support  on 
the  domestic  scene  without  serious  price  inflation  and  counterproductive  protectionism? 

Because  some  industries  are  more  efficient  abroad  it  will  be  necessary  to  procure  more  of  our 
military  materiel  abroad  as  well,  making  certain  that  several  independent  sources  are  cultivated,  and  that 
the  major  support  goes  to  our  political  allies  rather  than  our  avowed  enemies.  This  is  not  necessarily  a 
bad  thing  because  it  is  wasteful  to  duplicate  production  of  items  that  can  be  made  cheaper  elsewhere. 
Such  procurement  frees  up  resources  for  other  areas.  As  production  facilities  move  abroad,  however, 
some  critical  capacities  are  lost  and  difficult  to  regain.  With  the  loss  of  heavy  industry,  for  example,  the 
production  tool  industry  is  moving  abroad  as  well.  If  we  do  not  support  domestic  capacity,  perhaps 
supporting  efforts  to  "leapfrog”  plant  automation  practices  that  already  have  moved  abroad  by  developing 
even  more  advanced  systems,  the  tradition  and  art  of  large  tool  production,  in  which  we  formerly 
excelled,  may  be  lost  entirely.  The  future  cost  of  this  will  be  dear  should  the  political  conditions  require 
the  shift  in  emphasis  to  our  own  domestic  heavy  industry.  There  are  no  easy  answers  here,  but  selective 
support  of  high-tech  industrial  tool  design  and  production  by  the  military  should  help  maintain  some  of 
this  capability.  The  same  applies  to  other  areas  of  industry  that  we  may  be  losing--"seed  efforts"  to 
maintain  the  skills  are  definitely  in  the  long-term  national  interest. 

The  United  States  is  currently  in  a  strong  position  in  areas  such  as  chemistry,  non-metallic 
materials,  biotechnology  (agricultural  technology),  computer  hardware  design,  computer  software, 
optoelectronics,  telecommunications,  energy  source  technology,  and  in  the  aircraft  and  defence  industries 
producing  military  hardware,  as  well  as  in  space  technologies.  These  industries  are  likely  to  remain 
strong  in  the  forecast  period.  Some  effort  to  maintain  our  strength  in  these  areas  is  logical  for  our 
military  purchases. 

One  cannot  overestimate  the  future  importance  of  software.  The  software  failure  leading  to  the 
successful  penetration  by  the  Scud  missile  that  caused  the  major  losses  in  Desert  Storm  may  well  be  a 
harbinger  of  things  to  come:  as  the  military  systems  become  more  and  more  automated,  the  hardware 
becomes  cheaper  and  more  ubiquitous,  the  software  will  inevitably  remain  the  weak  link  in  the  next  25 
years.  There  is  no  avoiding  it,  because  it  is  software  that  makes  computers  useful,  and  if  any  area  is  to 
be  singled  out  in  the  need  to  maintain  excellence,  it  is  software.  The  present  U.S.  lead  in  software  seems 
insurmountable  because  of  the  healthy  domestic  consumer  industry  as  well  as  massive  high-tech 
procurement  by  the  federal  government.  We  must  be  careful  to  support  future  developments  in  automated 
software  design  technology  in  order  to  maintain  the  lead.  Automation  of  software  production  itself  is 
inevitable  in  the  long-term  future,  with  significant  developments  possible  during  the  forecast  period. 

With  regard  to  our  space  program,  history  will,  on  the  one  hand,  praise  our  landing  on  the  Moon 


184 


in  eggshell-thin  spacecraft  as  a  supreme  triumph  of  human  organization  and  teamwork  as  well  as  a 
miraculous  technological  feat,  while  condemning  us  for  placing  the  effot  in  the  context  of  a  sporting 
contest  with  the  Russians,  with  no  future  plan  beyond  the  sporting  event  itself,  rather  than  develping  a 
serious  continuing  scientific  effort.  Would  that  we  had  worked  truly  for  the  future  of  mankind  and 
established  a  working  scientific  and  industrial  colony  on  the  Moon,  with  working  settlements  in  space  and 
perhaps  even  a  Mars  mission.  None  of  this  would  have  competed  in  any  significant  way  with  efforts  to 
"imnprove  things  on  Earth."  Instead  we  have  wasted  precious  lives  and  resources  on  politically  naive 
no-win  debacles  of  all  sorts.  The  United  States  (or  some  other  nation)  will  get  back  to  serious  exploration 
and  development  off-plant,  but  probably  not  within  the  time  frame  addressed  by  this  report. 

Not  all  research  needs  funding.  Einstein’s  development  of  the  theory  of  relativity  could  not  really 
have  been  aided  by  any  significant  additional  funding  beyond,  perhaps,  some  personal  support. 
Theoretical  mathematicians  (especially  before  the  "computer  age")  did  much  significant  research  using 
paper-and  pencil  alone.  Some  personal  support  grants  in  this  kind  of  non-fund-intensive  research  may 
pay  off  handsomely,  however,  just  because  of  the  high  cost/benefit  ratio  to  the  supporting  organization, 
and  because  such  support  provides  benefits  to  the  general  scientific  infrastructure,  which  benefits  all  in 
the  long  run.  On  the  other  hand,  some  research  is  so  costly  that  only  combinations  of  governments  can 
undertake  it~the  Mars  manned  mission  comes  to  mind. 

Foreign  investment  in  U.S.  research  may  be  a  mixed  blessing,  but  in  current  economic 
circumstances,  and  with  globalization  of  the  utility  of  research  results,  it  is  unavoidable.  If  basic  research 
that  would  otherwise  have  to  be  funded  by  the  government  is  funded  instead  by  the  Japanese,  other 
research  money  that  our  government  (including  the  military)  can  put  to  good  use  is  freed  up.  It  is  no 
longer  feasible  to  keep  basic  research  secret  for  any  significant  length  of  time,  and  denial  of  such 
knowledge  to  the  enemy  unfortunately  denies  it  to  our  open-source  research  environment  as  well.  This 
is  not  to  say  that  specific  military  developments  should  not  be  kept  to  ourselves  as  long  as  possible  (e.g. 
keeping  the  most  advanced  EW  and  ECM  and  C3  electronics  out  of  the  aircraft  we  sell  to  our  allies  until 
our  own  are  upgraded  to  the  next  higher  level)  in  order  to  maintain  the  edge. 

Gross  dollars  devoted  to  technology  as  a  whole  are,  of  course,  significant  in  maintaining  progress, 
but  they  must  be  intelligently  focused.  The  cost  factor  of  technology  generation  upgrades  to  the  military 
has  been  projected  as  a  significant  barrier.  With  present  costs  of  sophisticated  aircraft  running  well  over 
a  billion  dollars,  it  has  been  said  that  in  the  future  the  armed  services  will  be  able  to  afford  only  a  single 
super-high-tech  aircraft!  In  addition,  it  takes  about  15  years  to  bring  a  new  generation  of  technology  (in 
the  sense  of  a  generation  of  heavy  equipment)  to  useful  application.  However,  it  must  be  remembered 
that  it  takes  as  much  money  to  make  a  single  memory  chip  of  the  kind  described  above  (in  terms  of  the 
cost  of  a  plant  to  produce  one,  never  mind  R&D  costs)  as  it  does  to  make  a  B1  bomber,  and  yet  a  256k 
DRAM  chip  can  be  bought  retail  for  a  buck  and  a  half.  Therefore,  the  military  has  a  choice  of  either 
putting  all  its  money  into  succeeding  generations  of  increasingly  expensive  single-purpose  platforms,  or 
designing  hardware  in  a  modifiable  modular  fashion  to  incorporate  future  improved  technology  as  such 
technology  is  developed,  preferably  in  conjunction  with  developments  in  the  open-market  mass  environ- 


185 


ments.  The  B-52  bomber  has  already  been  used  in  this  fashion,  which  is  why  it  still  survives,  while  the 
B-l  could  not  yet  even  be  used  in  Desert  Storm.  When  costs  of  technology  are  cited  as  a  barrier,  the 
question  must  be  asked  what  technology,  when,  and  to  what  end.  Replacement  of  black  boxes  with  better 
black  boxes  in  platforms  designed  for  modular  upgrade  may  well  be  the  way  to  go. 

The  2,000-lb  GBU-24  laser-guided  bombs  used  in  Desert  Storm  are  a  case  in  point.  They  were 
conventional  2,000-lb  "dumb  bombs"  fitted  with  TRW’s  Paveway  kit  at  a  total  cost  (bomb  included)  of 
$20,000  each.  This,  according  to  the  New  York  Times,  is  a  dramatic  reduction  in  price  from  1988,  when 
the  Paveway  kit  alone  cost  $40,000.  Compare  the  $20,000  figure  with  the  $1.3  million  each  cost  of  the 
equally  successful  Tomahawk  missile  used  by  the  U.S.  Navy  in  the  same  campaign.  It’s  clear  that  unless 
the  Tomahawk’s  extended  range  and  unmanned  delivery  are  critical  to  a  mission,  there  is  more  "bang  for 
the  buck,"  literally  speaking,  in  the  Paveway  conversion.  Plans  for  a  smarter  reusable  Tomahawk  are, 
of  course,  under  way. 

In  the  future,  this  modification  of  conventional  munitions  to  smart  munitions  is  likely  to  continue 
and,  possibly,  to  spread  as  well  to  "smart  micromunitions,"  the  rocket-propelled  grenade  being  the  first 
likely  modification.  Smart  shotgun  shells  may  well  follow.  Video  cameras-on-a-chip,  which  already  exist 
in  the  lab  (cigarette-lighter-sized  cameras  delivering  broadcast-quality  video  are  being  mounted  on  helmets 
of  quarterbacks  in  the  new  WLAF  World  League  American  Football),  may  be  followed  by  much  smaller 
active  devices  that  could  allow  the  marine  of  the  future  to  fire  his  weapon  at  45  degrees  elevation  in  the 
general  direction  of  the  enemy,  and  then  select  by  video  which  ammo  storage  box,  command-and-control 
node,  gasoline  tank,  or,  for  that  matter,  which  unfortunate  enemy  grunt  he  will  hit.  The  obverse  side 
of  this  picture  is  that  the  same  weapons  will  become  readily  available  to  the  enemy  terrorist. 

TECHNOLOGICAL  PROGRESS 

A  good  example  of  a  growing  technology,  exemplifying  progress  in  the  computer  field,  is  the 
increase  in  the  amount  of  random  access  memory  (and  consequent  reduction  in  price  per  byte  of  memory) 
in  personal  computers,  which  is  likely  to  continue  through  2015,  even  if  it  does  so  at  a  slower  rate  than 
the  present  400  percent  increase  every  two  years.  When  Apple  first  arrived  on  the  scene,  16  kilobit 
(16,000  bit)  DRAM  chips  were  the  vogue,  and  four  years  later  when  the  IBM  PC  arrived,  64  kilobit 
chips  were  the  rage.  To  make  8-bit  "bytes,"  a  "bank"  of  9  chips  is  used  (one  chip  for  "parity  checking" 
error  diagnosis),  so  that  with  4  banks  of  chips  on  the  basic  PC  "motherboard,"  16k  chips  yield  a  total 
storage  of  64  kilobytes  of  memory,  enough  to  store  32  pages  of  text  (2,000  bytes  per  page).  Now, 
twelve  years  later,  the  "state-of-art"  installed  chips  have  a  capacity  of  4  megabits  each  (4,000,000  bits), 
with  a  total  4-bank  capacity  of  16  megabytes  of  memory  on  the  motherboard  (enough  to  store  8,000  pages 
of  text).  More  memory  can,  of  course,  be  added  by  plugging  in  additional  "memory  boards."  The  next 
generation  of  chips  (to  be  delivered  in  1991  and  user-marketed  in  1992)  contain  16  megabits  each,  with 
64-megabit  chips  experimentally  produced.  The  Japanese  are  already  confident  enough  in  the  feasibility 
of  256-megabit  chips  to  invest  a  significant  amount  of  money  in  the  planning  of  plants  to  produce  them.

According  to  "Solid  State  Technology"  (December  1990),  Hitachi  is  constructing  an  R&D  wafer 
processing  facility  in  Ohme  near  Tokyo  to  be  used  for  256  Mb  DRAMs. 

The  prediction  of  feasibility  of  chips  with  1  Gigabit  capacity  (albeit  somewhat  physically  larger 
in  size  than  current  chips)  can  be  made  with  some  reasonable  confidence  for  the  time  frame  considered 
by  this  report.  A  4-bank  motherboard  memory  with  gigabit  chips,  by  the  way,  would  yield  4  gigabytes 
of  memory,  capable  of  storing  2  million  pages  of  text.  This  is  in  the  direct  operational  memory  only! 
Such  a  computer  will  cost  about  the  same  as  today  (around  $2,000)  or  else  the  industry  will  not  be  able 
to  sell  millions  of  them  and  make  a  profit.  Peripherals  like  laser  disks  can,  at  present,  store  about  a 
gigabyte  per  disk  (500  megabyte-disks  being  the  most  popular),  which  can  store  500,000  pages  of  text. 
Disk  media  now  under  study  (NTT’s  new  optochemical  hole-burning  method,  for  instance)  can  potentially 
yield  1000  times  that,  about  500,000,000  pages  of  ASCII  text  per  disk. 

If  this  sounds  like  a  large  number,  it  is.  The  Library  of  Congress,  in  1989,  contained  19,000,000 
books  in  its  collection  (plus  over  70,000,000  other  items)  with  an  average  of  385  pages  each,  so  for 
books  alone  in  ASCII  text  format,  14.63  trillion  bytes  of  storage  would  be  needed  (according  to  Felix 
Krayeski  of  the  Congressional  Research  Service  of  the  Library  of  Congress),  i.e.,  about  15,000  current- 
type  laser  disks  or  15  of  the  possible  future  disks.  A  manageable  number,  but  if  you  expect  to  have  the 
Library  of  Congress  in  your  collection  in  2015,  think  again,  because  the  problem  of  scanning  even  the 
current  20  million  books  page-by-page  without  damaging  them  (even  by  "intelligent  robots"  of  the  future) 
is  a  formidable  task  indeed.  In  graphic  raster  data  (300  by  300  dots  per  inch)  about  7,000  of  the  future 
disks  would  be  needed,  by  the  way.  At  any  rate  future  (2015)  published  material  (in  principle)  will 
become  readily  accessible  to  everyone  with  a  telephone  and  a  computer.  This  will  include  maps,  art 
work,  sound  recordings,  etc. 

The  brief  consideration  above  of  the  issue  of  computer  memory  development  is  but  a  tiny  sample 
of  current  progress  in  science  and  technology  as  a  whole.  A  vast  cornucopia  inundating  us  with  daily 
news  of  significant  discoveries  in  physics,  electronics,  astrophysics  (which  is,  strangely  enough,  critical 
to  particle  physics  and  the  basic  nature  of  matter),  biology,  biotechnology,  cybernetics,  medicine,  etc., 
etc.  (note  the  absence  of  social  sciences),  and  new  technological  marvels  are  becoming  everyday  gadgets. 
Some  of  these  are  immediately  useable  by  the  military  and  incorporated  in  record  time,  such  as  the  use 
of  Japanese  display  panels  in  military  aircraft,  and  the  use  of  cheap  geopositioning  equipment,  mass- 
produced  for  the  boating  public,  by  troops  in  Desert  Storm. 

A  comprehensive  view  of  the  total  picture  of  this  progress  in  all  areas  is  very  necessary  for 
military  planners,  but  is  unfortunately  clearly  beyond  the  scope  of  the  present  report. 

ASSESSMENT  OF  TECHNOLOGICAL  PROGRESS 

Precise  assessment  of  the  rate  of  technological  change,  especially  if  that  rate  is  to  be  used  as  a 
gauge  of  current  or  future  progress  during  a  rapid  development  phase,  is  not  as  subject  to  simple 
mechanical  calculation  as  it  might  first  appear,  even  in  the  case  of  the  memory  chips  above,  where  the 


187 


rate  seems  a  straightforward  affair.  Microchip  technology  development  depends,  for  instance,  on 
development  of  the  physics  and  chemistry  of  resists  (photosensitive  substances  that  allow  patterns  to  be 
etched  on  the  chips),  imaging  technologies  in  a  multitude  of  bands  from  infrared  through  soft  x-rays  (each 
of  these  technologies  is,  in  fact,  a  complex  combination  of  many  others),  substrate  development 
(encompassing  a  whole  raft  of  materials  technologies,  including  growth  and  processing  of  large  crystals 
and  their  "doping"  with  exact  amounts  of  impurities  at  precise  microlocations),  technologies  for 
deposition  of  thin  films  of  a  variety  of  exotic  substances,  etc.  When  one  begins  to  gauge  the  progress 
of  devices  in  which  the  chips  are  only  a  small  component,  the  problem  looms  even  larger.  The 
paradoxical  result  is  that  such  assessments  can  be  carried  out,  but  the  more  precise  they  are,  the  more 
limited  their  usefulness  for  long-range  prediction  because  change  in  any  of  the  component  technologies, 
either  in  a  breakthrough  or  an  unexpected  bottleneck,  can  affect  the  whole  process.  For  investment  of 
near-term  resources  these  assessments  are,  of  course,  invaluable. 

On  the  other  hand,  one  can  get  a  useful  "feel"  of  the  current  rate  of  change  by  considering  the 
differences  in  parameters  of  devices  in  current  use  as  compared  to  laboratory  devices  and  rational 
projections  of  demonstrated  capabilities  of  materials.  Paul  Zane  Pilzer  (Unlimited  wealth.  Crown  Publi¬ 
shers,  1990)  calls  this  the  "technology  gap."  The  thousand-fold  increase  in  the  memory  storage  capacity 
of  compact  disk  material,  mentioned  above,  being  developed  by  NTT  (Nippon  Telephone  and  Telegraph, 
reported  in  "Solid  State  Technology,"  December  1990)  is  accompanied  by  a  recording  rate  that  is 
"...roughly  100  million  times  faster  than  existing  storage  materials.  The  contents  of  a  full  newspaper 
page  can  be  stored  with  the  material  in  0.006  sec."  Multiplying  the  capacity  increase  by  the  rate 
increase,  we  get  a  "technology  gap"  of  one  hundred  billion.  Even  if  the  actual  devices  that  may  be 
developed  from  this  technology  (and,  as  pointed  out  earlier,  there  is  no  absolute  guarantee  of  success  in 
any  particular  enterprise)  are  "100  times  worse,"  that  still  leaves  a  potential  improvement  factor  of  about 
a  billion  or  so. 

Taking  another  example  from  the  February  1991  issue  of  "Lightwave,"  the  fiber-optics  industry 
news  magazine: 

Researchers  at  AT&T’s  Bell  Laboratories  said  they  have  successfully  boosted  the  speed 
and  capacity  of  fiber-optic  communications  systems.  The  researchers  reduced  an  intricate 
system  of  colliding-pulse  mode-locked  (CPM)  lasers  and  fibers  spread  over  a  four-foot- 
by-six-foot  laboratory  table  to  an  indium-phosphide  chip  measuring  two  square 
millimeters.  The  researchers  then  said  they  used  the  device  to  transmit  350  billion  light 
pulses  a  second,  each  shorter  than  a  trill ionth  of  a  second,  through  24  kilometers  of 
optical  fiber.  The  fastest  commercial  fiber  systems,  by  contrast,  currently  generate  2.5 
billion  light  pulses. 

Although  AT&T  said  it  doesn’t  expect  to  market  a  product  containing  the  new 
device  until  the  end  of  the  decade,  analysts  said  the  Bell  fiber  system,  together  with 
advances  in  high-capacity  fiber  cable,  could  speed  development  of  systems  that  can 
deliver  studio-quality  digital  television  signals  to  the  home  or  office  over  telephone  lines. 


188 


The  area  of  the  table  is  about  15,500  square  millimeters,  350  divided  by  2.5  is  140,  and, 
neglecting  the  change  in  thickness  of  the  equipment,  we  get  an  "improvement  factor"  of  over  1,000,000. 

Note  that  these  two  examples  are  even  more  impressive  when  one  considers  that  they  are  single- 
stage  improvements,  not  improvements  over  several  iterations  of  developmental  stages.  Granted,  these 
are  extremes,  but  they  were  found  at  random  over  a  very  limited  period  of  research  time,  and  similar 
factors  of  over  a  thousand  are  quite  routine  in  a  wide  variety  of  burgeoning  technologies.  Some  emerging 
technologies,  such  as  those  involving  recombinant  DNA,  or  the  development  of  artificial  photosynthesis, 
are  too  new  to  have  even  such  simple  "improvement  factors"  assigned,  yet  their  future  impact  may  be 
gauged  as  highly  significant,  even  revolutionary. 

One  important  reality  to  note  here  is  that  the  faster  a  technology  progresses,  the  faster  it  will 
"bump  up"  against  significant  physical  limits,  to  underline  the  realization  that  we  are  living  in  a  period 
that  can  be  called  a  tsunami  of  technological  transformation. 

TRENDS  IN  TECHNOLOGY  (METATREND-THE  LARGE  PICTURE) 

The  development  of  technological  applications  has  followed  a  repeated  cycle,  a  metatrend,  if  you 
will,  in  which  technology  is  first  introduced,  permitting  a  task  to  be  accomplished  in  a  better  way,  or  in 
a  way  that  could  not  have  been  done.  This  introduction,  however,  is  often,  if  not  always,  accompanied 
by  unavoidable  loss  of  flexibility  and  convenience,  frequently  tying  up  personnel  resources  and  presenting 
new  difficulties.  As  the  situation  progresses,  solutions  to  parts  of  the  new  problems  in  turn  present 
problems  of  their  own  with  regard  to  limitations  in  flexibility  and  convenience.  Ultimately  the  technology 
settles  down  to  a  situation  where  maximum  flexibility  with  maximum  power  prevails. 

In  military  history  (or  prehistory,  rather)  the  invention  of  the  litter  (the  first  vehicle,  perhaps) 
permitted  much  more  in  the  way  of  logistic  supplies  to  be  carried  by  a  war  party,  but  it  tied  up  personnel, 
and  much  energy  had  to  be  spent  to  simply  hold  up  the  load,  the  supplies  had  to  be  guarded,  and  the 
direction  of  travel  had  to  be  determined  by  a  "litter  supervisor"  (the  first  sergeant?).  Addition  of  the 
wheel  removed  the  need  for  human  bearers  to  hold  up  the  load,  but  limited  travel  to  more  unobstructed 
terrain.  Addition  of  the  ox  (the  first  engine?)  further  removed  the  need  for  human  motive  power,  making 
for  a  pretty  nifty  system,  but  too  slow  and  vulnerable  for  a  fighting  vehicle.  The  horse-drawn  chariot 
(the  first  military  attack  vehicle)  was  the  next  logical  development,  but  it  was  still  limited  by  terrain 
requirements  and,  more  critically,  subject  to  unwieldy  "command  and  control,"  needing  one  man  to  drive 
and  another  to  fight.  The  final  development  in  the  sequence  miniaturized  the  vehicle  and  simplified  the 
command-and-control  to  produce  a  truly  efficient  weapons  system.  The  vehicle  was  shrunk  to  the 
dimensions  of  a  saddle,  and  the  cavalryman  reigned  supreme  for  centuries  as  the  efficient  standard 
military  technology  of  an  advanced  society. 

The  power-to-weight  ratio  for  the  all-terrain  vehicle  was  hard  to  beat,  and  the  command-and-control  was 
fully  and  flexibly  integrated  with  the  offensive  and  defensive  weapons  subsystems  (sword  and  shield,  etc). 
The  most  sophisticated  element  was,  of  course,  the  computer  and  actuator  subsystem  of  the  weapons 


189 


platform  (the  cavalryman,  of  course),  which  still  remains  state-of-art,  not  likely  to  be  replaced  within  the 
time  scope  of  the  present  study. 

In  the  history  of  computer  development,  a  similar  process  has  taken  place,  with  the  centralized- 
versus-distributed  systems  argument.  The  first  trend  was  towards  large  expensive  systems,  because  they 
were  the  only  path  to  high  computing  power.  Access  to  them  was  provided  by  operators  servicing  lines 
of  users  carrying  packs  of  Hollerith  "computer  punch  cards,"  only  to  see,  all  too  often,  a  "system  down" 
sign  pasted  on  a  closed  upper  door  panel.  After  the  packs  were  accepted,  the  users  then  lined  up  again 
to  receive  their  packs  back,  plus  a  printout  that  all  too  often  said  "program  failed"  in  embarrassingly  large 
letters,  visible  to  all  the  others  in  the  line.  Later  the  "system  down"  sign  began  to  appear  on  what  is  now 
known  as  "dumb  terminals,"  and  the  input  of  programs  to  the  computer  began  to  be  limited  as  much  by 
saturation  of  the  telecommunications  channels  as  by  the  mainframe  computing  power. 

The  next  development  might  well  have  been  the  increasing  power  of  the  "dumb  terminal,"  still 
basically  attached  to  and  inseparable  from  a  mainframe,  with  the  outcome  being  a  highly  centralized 
"smart  system,"  epitomized  by  IBM’s  SNA  (systems  network  architecture)  with  a  rigid  hierarchical 
arrangement  of  information  processing.  What  happened  instead  was  that  some  hobbyists,  working  in 
garages,  developed  a  small  all-purpose  machine  for  other  hobbyists,  among  which  the  Apple  was  the  first 
large-scale  commercial  success,  fueling  a  furious  development  of  both  system  memory  (chips),  peripheral 
memory  (disk  drives,  etc.),  and  other  peripherals  that,  with  volume  sales,  became  cheap  as  well  as 
powerful  after  the  IBM  PC  anointed  the  personal  computer  as  a  full-fledged  business  system.  Software 
costing  millions  of  dollars  to  develop  could  then  be  sold  in  millions  of  copies  rather  than  hundreds  (or 
even  dozens),  with  consequent  impact  on  both  price  and  quality. 

The  power  of  the  PC  now  not  only  exceeds  that  of  former  mainframes,  but  includes  sophisticated 
local  storage  that  would  have  been  impossible  if  the  PC  had  not  become  a  commercial  commodity. 
Flexibility  and  power  have  been  given  to  the  user,  finally,  by  the  development  of  communications 
interface  hardware  and  software,  both  among  PC’s  and  with  mainframes  (initially  resisted  by  mainframe- 
types),  so  the  user  calls  the  shots,  and,  incidentally,  creates  a  huge  security  headache.  Information 
control  of  the  type  that  could  have  been  imposed  by  the  authorities  if  the  "smart  terminal"  rather  than  the 
PC  path  had  been  followed  is  now  impossible.  The  user  has  the  power  of  the  mainframe  at  his  fingertips 
and  will  have  it  even  more  so  in  2015,  the  time  frame  projected  by  the  Japanese  (NTT)  for  a  complete 
user-to-user  fiber-optic  communications  network,  also  likely  to  be  attained  by  that  time  in  the  United 
States.  The  process  of  going  over  completely  to  fiber  in  the  telecommunications  system  has  to  take  about 
that  much  time,  of  course,  because  of  the  enormity  and  cost  of  the  physical  task,  but  the  course  of  it  is 
one  of  the  most  predictable  aspects  of  technology  at  the  present  time.  Parallel-architecture  computers 
should  also  come  into  their  own  in  this  time  frame,  the  greatest  difficulty  in  their  implementation  being 
software  development  (else  they  could  flourish  even  sooner). 

The  most  significant  element  here,  however,  remains  the  fact  that  computer/communications 
technology  has  basically  passed  over  the  hump  of  inflexibility,  unwieldiness  and  inconvenience,  by  way 
of  empowering  that  same  "cavalryman"  above  to  call  the  shots  flexibly  within  a  comprehensive  integrated 


190 


command-and-control  network. 

The  functionality  of  the  integrated  ALB  battlefield  was  held  in  some  doubt  until  Desert  Storm 
even  by  a  brilliant  analyst  like  Martin  Van  Creveld,  who  speculated  that  with  current-level  battlefield 
integration,  the  low-tech  side  may  at  times  have  the  advantage  because  the  battlefield  can  become 
"frozen"  for  the  high-tech  side,  with  no  force  component  able  to  move  unless  another  moves  first.  In 
fact,  as  Desert  Storm  has  shown,  if  sufficient  tactical  flexibility  devolved  to  the  individual  platform  (tank, 
aircraft),  the  individual  platforms  in  the  integrated  battlefield  could  function  brilliantly,  selecting  alternate 
targets  and  targets  of  opportunity,  using  the  central  command  network  for  coordination  purposes,  while 
being  guided  by  it  for  the  larger  tactical  objective,  and  being  provided  by  it  with  information  needed  for 
survival  as  well  as  for  effective  delivery  of  munitions  to  target. 

TRENDS  AND  COMBINATIONS 

Some  of  the  principal  trends  in  technology  are  cited  below.  Many  of  them  act  as  change  drivers 
on  each  other.  Thus  electronic  miniaturization  goes  hand  in  hand  with  increase  in  processing  speed,  and 
the  requirement  for  processing  speed  mandates  miniaturization,  because  of  the  basic  limits  of  the  rate  at 
which  a  signal  can  travel  in  a  wire,  as  explained  earlier.  This  "bumping  up"  against  the  speed  of  light 
itself  as  a  barrier  in  turn  mandates  development  of  parallel  processing  architecture,  where  one  gains  total 
speed  by  having  several  microprocessors  handle  different  parts  of  the  task  at  the  same  time,  which  again 
requires  changes  in  the  way  software  is  written  so  that  separable  parts  of  a  task  can  be  segregated  and 
sent  to  different  microprocessors.  In  the  quest  for  better,  faster,  more  reliable,  more  secure,  etc. 
ANYTHING,  new  materials  and  processes  come  under  examination,  with  the  result  that  there  exists  a 
potential  for  radical  change  in  materials  science.  The  development  of  thin  film  technology  permits  new 
developments,  such  as  diamond  film  coatings  of  tools,  and  it  is  not  unlikely  that  growth  of  larger  crystal 
structures  will  become  possible  in  the  future,  given  the  current  rate  of  progress.  These  same  diamond 
films  are  an  excellent  substrate  for  computer  microchips,  allowing  faster  and  more  radiation-resistant 
components  to  be  fabricated.  Other  materials  of  potential  significance  abound,  such  as  the  recently 
reported  silicon  insulator  materials  for  CMOS  technology  developed  by  IBM  ("Byte,"  February  1991). 
The  number  of  such  technological  areas  of  potential  significant  progress  is  so  large  and  changing  so  cons¬ 
tantly  that  it  defies  enumeration,  and  the  only  rational  way  to  keep  up  with  it  is  through  adoption  of  large- 
scale  continuous  monitoring  projects  conducted  by  knowledgeable  science  generalists  in  consultation  with 
specialists  in  the  many  industries  involved. 

In  addition  to  the  physical  sciences,  which  we  have  emphasized,  the  recent  development  of  genetic 
engineering  holds  such  radical  change  potential  for  biology  that  reliable  prediction  for  the  2015  time 
frame  is  quite  impossible,  except  to  note  that  the  Human  Genome  project,  mapping  the  total  of  significant 
genetic  information  comprising  the  human  being,  is  slated  to  be  completed  well  before  then,  and  current 
biotechnology  has  already  proven  that  it  can  perform  as  expected,  in  a  safe  way  (not  according  to  Jeremy 
Rifkin),  with  dramatic  results.  Organisms  have  already  been  patented  as  products,  including  ones  as 


191 


complex  as  a  mouse.  And  "killer  genes"  within  some  cells  that  lead  to  their  shortened  life  span,  in 
conjunction  with  many  many  other  ongoing  and  future  relevant  studies,  may  well  provide  a  clue  to  the 
puzzle  of  human  aging.  This  breakthrough  could  be  followed  by  the  discovery  of  powerful  agents  for  the 
prevention  or  even  reversal  of  aging,  a  contingency  that  could  turn  out  to  be  the  greatest  disaster  of  all 
time,  or  the  greatest  change  agent  for  humanity. 

Suggestive  lists  of  some  issues  and  developments  follow,  which  are,  of  necessity,  far  too  short

With  regard  to  the  need  for  planning,  according  to  Martin  van  Creveld: 


The  long  lead  times  of  up  to  15  years  that  often  characterize  the  most  modern 
technologies  in  particular  means  that  most  wars  have  to  be  fought  with  the  hardware  at 
hand.  However,  those  very  same  lead  times  also  signify  that  planning  has  to  commence 
years  in  advance  and  involve  educated  guesses  concerning  the  nature  and  effect  of  devices 
which,  as  yet,  exist  only  on  the  drawing  boards,  or  simply  as  semi-articulated  ideas  in 
the  minds  of  inventors.  The  conflicting  demands  of  readiness  and  of  preparation,  of 
present  and  the  future,  make  this  task  extremely  difficult.  No  wonder  it  has  spawned  an 
entire  new  industry,  commonly  known  as  technological  forecasting,  that  has  much  in 
common  with  the  ancient  hocus-pocus,  (emphasis  added)

KEY  JUDGMENTS 


UNITED  STATES  MILITARY  SCIENCE 


—  By  the  year  2015  the  United  States  will  still  play  a  large  role  in  ensuring  the  stability 
of  the  international  balance.  The  United  States  will  have  jey  strategic  interests  in  the  Persian  Gulf, 
Europe,  the  Pacific,  and  Latin  America. 

—  The  Soviet  Union  will  occupy  a  position  of  prime  importance  in  U.S.  strategic 
planning  even  if  that  country  is  weakened  by  internal  political  problems  and  economic  crises. 

—  The  arms  race  will  have  been  scaled  down  and  the  development  of  weapons  necessary 
for  maintaining  deterrence  against  the  Soviet  Union  will  probably  take  place  at  a  slower  pace.  The 
United  States  will  continue  to  rely  on  a  modernized  mix  of  nuclear  systems  that  hold  critical  Soviet  assets 
at  risk. 

—  The  threat  of  nuclear  weapons  proliferation  to  smaller,  developing  countries  will  be 
a  greater  problem  than  the  Soviet  threat.  Space-based  surveillance  will  be  used  to  monitor  arms  control 
and  anti-proliferation  agreements  with  increased  effectiveness. 

—  By  the  year  2015  the  number  of  nations  possessing  nuclear  weapons  will  have  more 
than  doubled.  Nuclear  war  will  increasingly  be  viewed  as  an  unacceptable  alternative  for  achieving 
military  and  political  aims.  The  primary  focus  of  nuclear  weapons  will  be  on  the  proliferation  problem 
rather  than  superpower  confrontation. 

—  In  the  event  of  high-intensity  conflict,  large  quantities  of  weapons  systems,  with 
unprecedented  range  and  lethality,  specifically,  non-nuclear  strategic  capability  (NNSC)  would  be  fielded 
by  combatants.  Projection  of  air  power  would  be  especially  vital  since  the  United  States  will  have  a 
much  smaller  military  force  designed  to  respond  to  medium-  and  low-intensity  conflicts.  The  closing  of 
overseas  bases  and  demobilization  of  U.S. -based  forces  will  have  affected  force  structure,  making  it  more 
difficult  to  project  power  on  a  global  scale. 

-  Conventional  battle  will  most  likely  be  obsolete,  replaced  by  low-intensity  conflict 
(LIC).  This  type  of  third-world  conflict  will  require  the  understanding  of  cultural,  historical,  economic, 
and  social  roots  of  turmoil  as  well  as  the  political /military.  The  Army  would  be  well  served  by  an 
enhanced  Foreign  Area  Officer  Program,  wherein  the  warrior-scholar  would  be  of  great  value  to  the 
nation. 

—  By  the  year  2015  the  advanced  technology  of  the  U.S.  military  will  provide  the 
maximum  warfighting  potential  from  less  manpower.  A  smaller,  home-based,  highly  professional  army 
will  be  the  order  of  the  day.

UNITED  STATES  MILITARY  SCIENCE  TO  2015 


STATE  OF  THE  ART  TODAY 
The  Strategic  Environment 

As  a  global  power,  the  United  States  has  global  interests.  Defining  those  interests  in  a  highly 
uncertain,  constantly  changing  strategic  environment  is  both  a  political  and  a  military  task.  Most  military 
thinkers  agree  that  the  changes  in  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Soviet  Union  do  not  mean  that  the  threat  to 
American  interests  around  the  world  is  any  less.  Although  the  Soviets  are  clearly  looking  inward  and 
focusing  their  attention  more  on  longstanding  internal  problems  than  on  military  competition  with  the 
West,  the  ultimate  direction  of  Soviet  change  is  not  yet  clear.  Furthermore,  as  the  war  with  Iraq  serves 
to  remind  the  U.S.  military,  new  security  challenges  are  arising  in  other  areas  of  the  world.  Since  World 
War  II,  the  developing  world  has  experienced  on  average  at  least  25  internal  and  international  conflicts 
each  year.  [1]  Many  developing  nations  are  gaining  increasingly  formidable  and  sophisticated  weapons, 
including  nuclear  and  chemical  weapons.  And  terrorism  and  insurgency  are  on  the  rise  everywhere. 

The  goal  of  U.S.  national  security  policy  today  is  to  preserve  the  United  States  as  a  free  and 
independent  nation,  a  goal  that  is  furthered  by  interrelated  political,  economic,  and  defense  strategies. 
The  foundation  of  U.S.  defense  strategy  is  deterrence,  based  on  nuclear  and  conventional  forces,  as  well 
as  on  international  alliances  and  power  projection  capabilities.  Although  the  first  priority  of  U.S.  defense 
strategy  continues  to  be  that  of  deterring  nuclear  attack,  the  U.S.  has  commitments  and  interests  around 
the  globe  that  require  U.S.  military  forces.  Conventional  capabilities  are  seen  as  essential  to  deter  and 
contain  local  conflicts  that  might  threaten  the  interests  of  the  U.S.  and  its  allies. 

The  Operational  Continuum 

At  present  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  takes  a  view  of  military  science  that  extends  beyond 
straightforward  battle  doctrine  and  encompasses  broader  strategic  concepts.  One  of  these  concepts  is  the 
so-called  "operational  continuum,"  which  basically  describes  the  various  levels  of  interaction  between 
nation-states.  The  first  level  of  interaction  is  peacetime  competition  between  nations.  This  includes 
trade,  technological  and  military  competition,  and  efforts  to  extend  military  influence  beyond  borders. 
These  activities  have  been  termed  "operations  short  of  conflict." 

The  next  level  of  the  continuum  is  conflict  that  falls  short  of  war.  This  could  arise  out  of 
insurrection  or  instability  within  one  country  that  creates  broader  instabilities  in  the  region.  Conflict 
might  mean  that  the  military  makes  a  show  of  force  in  another  country  and  even  carries  out  raids  or 
surgical  strikes,  such  as  the  United  States  did  against  Libya,  Grenada  or  Panama.  The  third  level  of  the 
continuum  is  all-out  war,  either  limited  and  regional  or  global. 


204 


Joint  and  Combined  Operations 


Joint  operations  is  a  fundamental  tenet  of  current  U.S.  military  doctrine.  It  refers  to  the  basic 
chain  of  command,  which  begins  with  the  President  of  the  United  States,  goes  through  the  Secretary  of 
Defense  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  and  then  to  the  Theater  Commander-in-Chief 
(CINC).  The  CINC  is  responsible  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense  for  accomplishing  his  designated  mission 
and  operates  under  the  strategic  direction  of  the  JCS.  This  is  a  so-called  unified  command.  The 
individual  services  are  responsible  for  providing  their  contingents  to  the  CINC.  In  addition  to  joint 
operations,  the  U.S.  military  also  prepares  for  combined  operations  with  land,  air,  and  naval  forces  of 
allied  governments.  Doctrines,  procedures,  and  principles  have  been  developed  to  enhance  inter-allied 
coordination.  The  recent  war  with  Iraq  exemplifies  the  concept  of  combined  operations. 


AirLand  Battle  and  AirLand  Battle-Future 

The  AirLand  Battle  Doctrine  describes  the  Army’s  approach  to  generating  and  applying  combat 
power  at  the  operational  and  tactical  levels.  [9]  The  concept  of  AirLand  Battle  is  based  on  the  three- 
dimensional  nature  of  modern  warfare  and  the  view  that  all  ground  actions  above  the  level  of  minor 
engagements  are  greatly  affected  by  the  supporting  air  operations  of  one  or  both  combatants.  AirLand 
Battle  Doctrine  recognizes  that  modern  warfare  is  likely  to  be  fluid  and  nonlinear,  so  it  takes  an  enlarged 
view  of  the  battlefield  and  emphasizes  unified  air,  ground,  and  sea  operations  throughout  the  theater. 

AirLand  Battle-Future  (ALB-F)  or  AirLand  Operations,  which  will  become  doctrine  within  two 
.years,  is  a  refined  version  of  the  AirLand  Battle  concept.  Basically,  it  assumes  a  smaller  army  with 
improved  technology  that  will  enable  the  U.S.  military  to  find  the  enemy  at  greater  depth  than  ever 
before.  Such  precise  location  of  enemy  formations  will  allow  the  U.S.  miltary  to  accept  gaps  between 
its  units  and  to  maneuver  a  reduced  number  of  forces.  Technology  also  will  facilitate  precision  deep 
strikes  against  the  enemy  such  as  those  achieved  by  the  laser-guided  bombs  of  Operation  Desert  Storm. 
ALB-F/ALO  places  more  focus  on  enemy  forces  as  the  objective  than  airland  battle  doctrine.  ALB- 
F/ALO  is  likely  to  remain  army  doctrine  into  the  early  years  of  the  21st  century,  but  numerous  outside 
factors  could  change  this  doctrine  before  the  year  2015. 

Nuclear  War  Doctrine 

United  States  strategy  towards  nuclear  war  has  evolved  around  several  key  concepts  during  the 
past  25  years.  Because  the  devastating  effects  of  nuclear  war  have  been  generally  acknowledged,  these 
concepts  are  based  on  deterrence  and  escalation  control,  while  scenarios  for  nuclear  war  that  have  been 
posited  have  tended  to  focus  on  Soviet  objectives  and  intentions.  NATO  allies,  for  example,  have  long 


205 


debated  the  question  of  what  form  of  "flexible  response"  would  be  most  effective  in  meeting  a  Soviet 
conventional  threat.  And  increasing  efforts  were  begun  in  the  1980s  to  develop  nuclear  weapons  that 
would  permit  a  limited  response  to  Soviet  aggression  rather  than  an  all-out  nuclear  attack. 

Recognizing  that  nuclear  weapons  are  too  terrible  to  be  used,  U.S.  military  thinkers  have 
discussed  nuclear  warfighting  strategy  largely  in  terms  of  how  the  United  States  and  NATO  would 
respond  to  Soviet  aggression.  At  the  same  time,  however,  because  maintaining  a  nuclear  balance  has 
long  been  seen  as  the  key  to  deterrence,  the  United  States  and  its  allies  have  devoted  tremendous 
expenditures  to  building  up  a  nuclear  arsenal.  They  have  shared  a  belief  that  a  modernized  mix  of 
nuclear  systems  is  essential  to  holding  critical  Soviet  assets  at  risk.  Recent  developments  have  caused 
U.S.  military  scientists  to  reassess  this  strategy.  The  dismantling  of  the  Soviet  empire  in  Eastern  Europe, 
the  moves  within  the  Soviet  Union  to  introduce  democratic  reform,  and  the  willingness  of  Soviet  officials 
to  engage  in  concrete  arms  control  agreements  have  given  rise  to  an  increased  emphasis  on  arms  control 
and  a  general  recognition  that  the  nuclear  debate  is  becoming  increasingly  irrelevant  to  global  realities. 
Dicussions  about  the  nuclear  threat  now  center  just  as  much  on  nuclear  proliferation  as  they  do  on  the 
Soviet  nuclear  arsenal,  making  nuclear  arms  control  an  even  more  important  U.S.  strategic  aim. 

NATIONAL  SECURITY  INTERESTS  AND  OBJECTIVES  -  2015 

As  a  superpower,  the  United  States  will  continue  to  have  strong  global  interests  in  the  year  2015. 
Communications  and  transportation  technologies  will  shrink  the  world  at  a  rapid  pace,  a  process  that 
could  transform  the  world  into  a  global  community.  Collective  security  arrangements  and  politico- 
economic  alliances  will  unite  individual  states  into  larger  bodies.  Strategic  decision-making  will  take 
place  in  the  context  of  multinational  bodies  like  the  United  Nations.  Greater  security  cooperation  among 
states  will  be  furthered  by  environmental  and  economic  concerns,  which  extend  well  beyond  national 
borders.  Issues  such  as  global  warming,  overpopulation,  and  the  depletion  of  the  ozone  layer  will  create 
a  basis  for  new  global  agreements  that  will  set  a  pattern  of  increasing  inter-dependence  and  mutual 
cooperation  among  nation  states.  Such  interaction  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  security  matters. 

The  United  States  will  continue  to  play  a  large  role  in  ensuring  the  stability  of  the  international 
balance.  The  United  States  will  have  important  strategic  interests  around  the  world,  especially  in  the 
following  areas: 

1)  Persian  Gulf  -  By  2015  the  United  States  could  be  more  self-sufficient  in  terms  of  energy  requirements, 
but  this  is  doubtful.  It  is  more  likely  that  the  nation  will  still  depend  heavily  on  the  Middle  East  for  oil 
and  will  continue  to  deem  this  an  area  of  key  strategic  interest.  The  political  complexion  of  the  Middle 
East  will  have  changed  considerably  from  what  it  is  now.  Islamic  fundamentalism  will  be  the  driving 
force  in  the  region,  replacing  traditional  forms  of  rule  by  oil  sheiks.  This  fact  will  create  widespread 
instability  and  pose  new  challenges  for  the  United  States  in  protecting  its  interests  in  the  area.  In  general, 
we  will  support  friendly  states  and  act  to  prevent  hostile  powers  from  acts  of  aggression  in  the  region  and 
from  gaining  control  of  oil  supplies  and  communications. 


206 


2)  Europe  -  The  United  States  will  continue  to  have  a  close  security  and  economic  relationship  with  the 
countries  of  Europe,  although  it  is  likely  that  NATO  will  be  more  a  political  than  a  military  alliance  by 
2015.  As  in  the  past,  the  United  States  will  consider  part  of  its  national  security  concerns  to  preserve 
a  peaceful  and  economically  stable  European  community.  Though  our  forces  will  be  reduced,  we  will 
maintain  our  commitment  to  European  security.  This  will  be  seen  as  necessary  despite  the  Soviet 
withdrawal  from  Eastern  Europe  and  the  other  indications  that  it  is  modifying  its  traditional  security 
priorities.  According  to  one  source:  "Although  internal  weakness  and  political  disarray  contributed  to 
the  need  to  retreat  from  cold  war  confrontation  with  the  West  they  [the  Soviets]  also  may  serve  to 
paralyze  security  reform."  [4]  In  other  words,  it  cannot  be  assumed  that  by  2015  the  Soviet  Union  will 
no  longer  pose  a  threat  to  Europe. 

3)  The  Pacific  area  will  grow  in  importance  for  United  States  security  interests,  although  our  interests 
will  be  less  focused  on  the  traditional  threat.  Worries  about  Communist  insurgency  will  recede  in  the 
face  of  new  challenges.  Japan  will  remain  the  dominant  economic  power,  although  it  is  unlikely  to 
change  its  security  policy,  which  is  non-interventionist  and  pacifistic.  China,  on  the  other  hand,  will  be 
a  nuclear  power  to  reckon  with.  Many  experts  expect  China  to  exercise  far  more  power  and  influence 
in  the  early  21st  century  than  it  has  in  the  past.  Despite  China’s  growing  importance,  Marxism-Leninism 
will  probably  have  little  appeal  for  third-world  states  of  the  Pacific  area,  such  as  the  Philippines.  And 
the  Soviet  Union  may  be  so  involved  with  its  own  internal  problems  that  it  will  not  be  making  substantial 
attempts  to  influence  political  events  there.  Nonetheless,  violence  and  armed  conflict  will  become 
increasingly  prevalent  as  population  and  poverty  swell,  thus  creating  a  security  concern  for  the  United 
States. 

4)  Latin  America  -  The  American  hemisphere  will  take  on  new  strategic  importance  for  the  United  States 
towards  2015.  Overpopulation,  environmental,  and  economic  problems  will  cause  increasing  societal 
disruption  in  Latin  America.  Therefore  we  can  expect  greater  political  instability  and  violence.  The  U.S. 
military  will  view  such  instability  as  a  threat  to  its  own  strategic  security  and  will  therefore  maintain  a 
readiness  to  intervene  militarily  when  such  a  threat  warrants  intervention. 

5)  As  in  the  past  the  Soviet  Union  will  continue  to  occupy  a  place  of  prime  importance  in  U.S.  strategic 
planning,  even  if  the  Soviet  Union  is  considerably  weakened  by  the  dissolution  of  its  unified  state  or 
burdened  with  economic  and  ethnic  problems.  Maintaining  stable  nuclear  deterrence  in  relation  to  the 
Soviet  Union  will  still  be  an  aim  of  U.S.  policy,  although  it  will  not  be  in  the  forefront  of  U.S.  strategic 
concerns.  Given  the  state  of  the  Soviet  economy  in  1991  and  the  extent  of  its  internal  political  problems, 
it  is  unlikely  that  the  USSR  will  be  able  to  maintain  the  pace  of  technological  advancement  in  either 
nuclear  or  conventional  weapons  that  it  has  maintained  in  the  past.  Therefore  the  arms  race  will  likely 
be  scaled  down  and  the  development  of  weapons  necessary  for  maintaining  deterrence  against  the  Soviet 
Union  will  probably  take  place  at  a  slower  pace. 

Although  the  United  States  will  continue  to  rely  on  a  modernized  mix  of  nuclear  systems  that  hold 
critical  Soviet  assets  at  risk,  the  threat  posed  by  the  proliferation  of  nuclear  weapons  in  other,  smaller 
nations  will  be  perceived  as  just  as  great  a  problem  as  the  Soviet  threat.  Indeed,  according  to  most 


207 


scenarios,  proliferation  of  nuclear  and  conventional  weapons  throughout  the  world  will  continue  well  into 
the  21st  century.  [27]  Tensions,  therefore,  will  be  high,  and  armed  conflict,  as  a  means  for  nations  to 
protect  their  economic  infrastructures,  will  be  an  ever-present  threat. 

It  is,  of  course,  impossible  to  predict  where  and  against  whom  the  United  States  will  have  to 
focus  its  military  strength  in  2015.  Colin  Gray  says  that  the  future  of  international  security  politics  is 
likely  to  be  very  much  like  its  past.  Alliance  ties  may  alter  and  technology  will  shift,  but  strategic 
geography  will  remain  a  critical  subject  with  persistent  implications  for  U.S.  defense  planning.  [11]  An 
important  principle  that  Gray  postulates  for  this  period  is  to  "retain  the  flexibilty  to  adjust  to  change." 
Another  probable  security  concern  for  the  United  States  will  be  the  growing  incidence  of  low-intensity 
conflict  in  all  areas  of  the  world.  (See  discussion  below.) 

As  Gray  points  out,  the  classic  threats  to  the  United  States  are  receding,  but  this  does  not  mean 
a  more  secure  world  for  the  future.  More  than  likely  what  the  United  States  will  face  as  a  security 
concern  in  2015  are  serious  political  upheavals  in  East-Central  Europe,  including  the  Soviet  Union.  For 
this  reason  it  will  be  in  the  interests  of  the  United  States  to  maintain  some  sort  of  military  presence  in 
Europe,  perhaps  as  a  counterweight  to  a  united  and  economically  strong  Germany.  It  is  quite  possible 
that  the  United  States  will  continue  to  lose  economic  influence  in  Europe,  particularly  with  the  expanding 
role  of  the  European  Economic  Community  (EEC).  Nonetheless  the  United  States  will  still  be  a 
superpower  and,  as  such,  will  be  called  upon  to  confront  any  threats  to  the  balance  of  power  in  Eurasia. 
As  Gray  notes:  "By  virtue  of  its  economic  size,  the  scale  of  its  military  forces,  its  global  mobility  and 
the  cover  of  its  nuclear  deterrent,  the  United  States  will  remain  in  a  class  by  itself  as  a  power  for  order 
and  stability."  [11] 

One  alternative  scenario  to  the  one  which  postulates  that  the  United  States  will  be  a  superpower 
with  global  interests  in  2015  is  one  which  places  the  United  States  in  an  isolationist  stance.  [27] 
According  to  this  scenario  the  United  States  remains  a  prosperous  postindustrial  state,  but  other  nations 
have  achieved  new  international  economic  status  and  increased  power  and  prestige  in  their  regions.  This 
changed  status  has  had  an  adverse  affect  on  U.S.  international  political  influence  and  caused  U.S.  forces 
to  be  dispelled  from  all  overseas  bases.  The  United  States  has,  as  a  result,  turned  inward  and  become 
more  isolationist,  concerned  with  social  welfare,  environmental  and  other  internal  issues.  In  this 
scenario,  U.S.  reliance  on  nuclear  deterrence  is  much  greater  than  it  was  at  the  turn  of  the  century. 

Potential  Impact  of  Arms  Control 

The  arms  control  process  will  continue  to  be  centered  on  the  Soviet  Union.  Although  events  of 
the  past  few  years  have  given  the  United  States  some  cause  for  optimism  about  bi-lateral  agreements  with 
the  Soviet  Union,  the  arms  control  process  will  be  lengthy.  Given  the  extent  of  its  economic  problems, 
the  Soviet  Union  has  a  high  incentive  to  further  the  arms  control  process,  and  to  work  for  cuts  in  both 
nuclear  and  conventional  forces.  Yet  the  highly  turbulent  political  environment  in  the  Soviet  Union  might 
in  the  long  run  work  against  arms  control.  Arms  control  efforts  will  also  be  directed  at  the  problem  of 


208 


nuclear  proliferation.  Negotiations  will  be  a  highly  political  process,  most  likely  linked  to  forms  of 
economic  aid  as  a  means  of  leverage. 

NUCLEAR  WAR  IN  2015 

Most  experts  agree  that  the  trend  toward  less  emphasis  on  nuclear  weapons  in  strategic  planning 
for  possible  wars  between  the  global  superpowers  will  continue.  Nuclear  war  will  increasingly  be  viewed 
as  an  unacceptable  alternative  for  achieving  military  and  political  aims.  The  risk  of  arousing  politically 
damaging  opposition  at  home,  together  with  the  problem  of  limited  economic  resources,  will  put  more 
and  more  restraints  on  nuclear  force  planning.  Although  the  United  States  will  continue  to  build  nuclear 
weapons,  nuclear  weapons  could  become  so  discredited  domestically  that  the  United  States  will  have  great 
difficulties  persuading  its  adversaries  that  it  will  employ  these  weapons.  However,  the  American  public 
would  likely  demand  retaliatory  use  of  nuclear  weapons  if  U.S.  forces  were  subjected  to  nuclear  or 
chemical/biological  attack. 

One  analyst  has  observed  that  "with  respect  to  nuclear  weapons,  United  States  thinking  since 
World  War  II  has  gone  from  fascination  with  things  nuclear  to  appreciation  of  the  limitations  of  such 
weapons. "  [25]  Smith  and  others  argue  that  there  will  continue  to  be  a  general  desire  among  the  nuclear 
powers  to  avoid  destroying  the  world.  Nonetheless,  nuclear  weapons  will  be  still  be  very  much  around 
in  2015,  and  any  war  fought  between  the  superpowers  will  be  fought  in  the  nuclear  environment.  As  a 
result,  if  one  side  is  on  the  verge  of  military  collapse  in  a  conventional  war,  the  nuclear  reality  will  be 
at  the  very  least  reckoned  with.  Smith  asks:  "Would  the  Soviets  choose  to  lose  a  war  of  conventional 
forces  rather  than  initiate  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons  themselves?"  and  goes  on  to  observe:  "Few  would 
argue  that  the  Soviets  would  never  think  such  thoughts;  clearly  nuclear  weapons  will  continue  to  be  a 
factor  in  any  war  between  major  powers." 

Ironically,  this  future  scenario  that  advances  with  the  possibility  of  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons 
might  be  made  more  likely  as  a  result  of  technological  advances  in  conventional  warfare.  One  source 
suggests  that  a  future  form  of  high-technology,  fourth  generation  warfare  might  carry  in  it  seeds  of 
nuclear  destruction.  Its  effectiveness  could  rapidly  eliminate  the  ability  of  a  nuclear-armed  opponent  to 
wage  war  conventionally:  "Destruction  or  disruption  of  vital  industrial  capacities,  political  infrastructure 
and  social  fabric,  coupled  with  sudden  shifts  in  balance  of  power  and  concomitant  emotions,  could  easily 
lead  to  escalation  to  nuclear  weapons."  [14] 

In  general,  experts  foresee  a  continued  reliance  on  deterrence  as  the  basis  for  U.S.  nuclear  policy. 
Arms  reduction  agreements  such  as  START  will  result  in  balanced  and  reduced  offensive  forces,  but  the 
mission  of  deterrence  will  endure  and  the  triad  concept  will  remain  fundamental  to  this  strategy. 

Some  insist  that  the  United  States  will  also  continue  to  need  modern  theater  nuclear  weapons  as  a 
deterrent  aspect  of  the  NATO  strategy  of  flexible  response.  On  the  other  hand,  one  study  concludes  that 
"flexible  response  will  be  a  mere  anachronism  if  Europeans  prohibit  the  modernization  of  theater  nuclear 
forces  or  if  such  forces  are  reduced  to  zero  through  negotiations  -  or  if  we  find  that  our  theater  nuclear 


209 


weapons  are  targeted  at  a  democratic  Eastern  Europe. "  [8] 

Technology  of  course  will  also  shift  the  course  of  nuclear  planning  by  the  year  2015.  Indeed, 
some  argue  that  the  continued  development  of  the  Strategic  Defense  Initiative  (SDI)  takes  the  defense 
against  nuclear  weapons  from  the  U.S.  military  and  places  it  in  the  hands  of  technology.  One  analyst 
observes  that  by  2015  nuclear  warfare  will  already  be  totally  in  the  realm  of  space:  "If  nuclear  weapons 
continue  to  exist  it  seems  appropriate  that  their  venue  be  deep  space  rather  than  our  small,  blue  planet." 
[19]  Whether  or  not  this  scenario  is  realistic,  one  thing  seems  clear.  Space-based  surveillance  systems 
will  be  so  advanced  technologically  by  2015  that  arms  control  agreements  with  other  major  powers  will 
be  monitored  with  100  per  cent  effectiveness.  Therefore  arms  control  will  continue  to  be  a  key  element 
of  U.S.  strategic  policy  in  the  nuclear  realm. 

The  main  focus  of  nuclear  weapons  in  the  future  will  be  centered  on  the  problem  of  nuclear 
proliferation  rather  than  on  super-power  confrontation.  By  2015  the  number  of  nations  possessing  nuclear 
weapons  will  have  more  than  doubled.  As  Defense  Secretary  Cheney  has  observed:  "Advanced 
technology  can  make  third-class  powers  into  first-class  threats."  [3]  The  possibility  that  regional  conflicts 
will  become  nuclear  ones  will  be  one  of  the  greatest  threats  facing  U.S.  security  planners  in  2015.  This 
situation  will  not  only  keep  the  nuclear  question  very  much  alive;  it  also  could  reduce  United  States 
willingness  to  deploy  forces  around  the  globe  because  of  the  danger  that  these  forces  would  be  attacked 
by  a  hostile  regional  power.  Here  too,  however,  U.S.  space  surveillance  capabilities  will  at  the  very  least 
enable  military  planners  to  pinpoint  the  danger  spots  with  total  accuracy  and  eliminate  all  elements  of 
surprise. 

CONVENTIONAL  WAR  IN  2015 
High  Intensity  Conflict 

This  type  of  conventional  warfare  is  global  in  scope  and  objective,  e 
ntailing  the  use  of  all  domestic  resources  over  a  long  period  of  time  and  most  likely  being  a  major  world 
war  with  all  the  superpowers  involved.  This  is  the  level  of  conflict  that  is  directly  below  nuclear  war  on 
the  scale  of  intensity  and  could  escalate  into  nuclear  war.  High  intensity  conflict  is  likely  to  be  highly 
destructive  and  extend  across  a  wide  space  of  air,  land,  and  sea.  Combatants  in  this  type  of  war  would 
field  large  quantities  of  high  quality  weapons  systems,  with  unprecedented  range  and  lethality.  Power 
projection  capabilities  of  the  air  force  would  be  especially  vital  in  such  a  war,  since  the  ability  to  reach 
all  over  the  globe  from  just  a  few  bases  would  likely  be  achieved  by  2015.  Complementary  Air  Force 
and  naval  operations  would  play  a  prominent  role.  Wide-ranging  surveillance  and  communications 
technology  would  increase  the  range  and  scope  of  the  battle.  Chemical  and  biological  weapons  are  likely 
to  be  encountered. 

High  intensity  conflict  requires  the  projection  of  conventional  forces  to  parts  of  the  globe  where 
there  are  no  pre-positioned  forces  or  supplies.  The  power  projection  capability  will  be  especially 


210 


important  in  2015  because  the  United  States  will  have  a  much  smaller  military,  designed  to  respond  to 
medium-  and  low-intensity  conflicts.  The  loss  of  overseas  bases  and  the  demobilization  of  U.S. -based 
forces  will  have  affected  the  force  structure,  making  it  more  difficult  to  project  power  on  a  global  scale. 
Thus,  for  example,  United  States  forces  in  Europe  will  have  shrunk  dramatically.  Sea  transport  will  be 
the  primary  means  of  large-scale  deployment,  with  satellite  surveillance  and  space-based  defense  of  sea 
lanes  playing  a  crucial  role,  particularly  in  cases  of  conflict  of  long  duration.  In  a  future  high-intensity 
war,  it  will  be  essential  for  the  United  States  to  have  ASAT  capability  in  order  to  execute  deep  and 
accurate  strikes  into  enemy  territory  with  precision  non-nuclear  weapons. 

In  high-intensity  conflict  U.S.  forces  must  have  sufficient  firepower  to  deter  or  contain  or  even 
end  the  conflict  in  the  early  stages,  before  nuclear  weapons  are  used.  Firepower  will  be  furnished  by 
carrier-based  support  aircraft,  strategic  bombers,  cruise  missiles,  and  from  long-range,  land-based 
missiles.  The  force  must  have  the  ability  to  sustain  combat  and  destroy  enemy  forces  for  a  prolonged 
period.  In  order  to  be  prepared  for  high-intensity  conflict  the  United  States  must  have  a  large  inventory 
of  air-,  land-  and  sea-launched  smart  weapons  because  even  by  the  year  2015  the  defense  industry  will 
not  be  able  to  produce  these  technologically  sophisticated  weapons  on  short  notice. 

U.S.  military  scientists  forsee  the  likely  form  of  defense  in  a  high-intensity  conflict,  such  as  that 
which  might  occur  in  Europe,  to  be  that  embodied  in  the  concepts  of  AirLand  Battle-Future.  [17;8]  In 
other  words,  the  conflict  will  take  place  in  a  highly  fluid  battlefield,  with  an  undiscernible  front  line,  and 
operations  will  be  non-linear.  The  depth  and  width  of  the  battlefield  will  expand  as  new  systems,  such 
as  the  Army  Tactical  Missile  System  (ATACMS),  are  developed.  The  ATACMS  will  give  corps 
commanders  the  ability  to  strike  enemy  formations  over  100  kilometers  away.  Another  system  is  the 
Joint  Surveillance,  Targeting  and  Reconnaissance  System  (JSTARS).  It  is  important  to  note,  however, 
that  these  systems  may  fall  victim  to  cuts  in  defense  spending  as  a  result  of  the  perceived  lower  threat 
from  the  Soviet  Union. 

Mid-Intensitv  Conflict 

This  is  another  concept  on  the  operational  continuum  of  likely  scenarios  for  the  future.  A  mid¬ 
intensity  conflict  is  a  conventional  war  confined  to  one  area  of  the  globe  and  involves  a  regional  power, 
rather  than  a  superpower.  The  prototypical  mid-intensity  conflict  has  long  been  assumed  to  be  that  which 
would  occur  in  Southwest  Asia,  and  the  recent  war  with  Iraq  has  provided  a  concrete  example.  This  mid¬ 
intensity  conflict  presented  a  considerable  challenge  for  the  United  States  because  Iraq  had  high- 
technology  weapons  systems  and  in  order  to  respond  to  threats  posed  by  these  systems  the  United  States 
had  to  mobilize  its  assets  over  great  distances.  Iraq  was  the  world’s  sixth  largest  army,  with  more  than 
1 ,000  tanks.  Moreover,  there  was  the  added  complication  of  having  to  gain  support  for  the  attack  on  Iraq 
from  the  other  superpowers. 

As  a  mid-intensity  conflict,  Operation  Desert  Storm  served  also  as  an  example  of  the  AirLand 
Battle  doctrine  in  practice.  Just  as  with  the  high-intensity  conflict  envisaged  by  military  planners,  the  war 


211 


with  Iraq  required  the  United  States  and  its  allies  to  project  power  over  a  long  distance  and  to  employ 
its  forces  in  a  joint  operations  and  combined  arms  mode.  Laser-guided  bombs  enabled  the  allied  forces 
to  accurately  strike  the  enemy  at  great  distances.  Most  military  planners  see  the  success  of  the  war 
against  Iraq  as  proof  of  the  efficacy  of  the  AirLand  Battle  doctrine  and  thus  as  a  justification  for 
proceeding  to  the  next  stage-Airland  Battle  Future,  which  is  fundamentally  a  refinement  of  the  ALB. 
ALBF  places  a  premium  on  mobility,  agility,  flexibility,  and  rapid  movement.  It  posits  a  battlefield 
where  there  are  fewer  troops  in  more  open  formations,  a  less  structured  battlefield,  where  forces  will  rely 
even  more  than  today  on  smart  weapons  that  penetrate  deep  into  the  enemy’s  rear. 

ALBF  is  more  in  keeping  with  the  U.S.  military’s  probable  future  mission  of  projecting  land 
power  to  distant  theaters  as  part  of  joint  and  combined  forces.  This  projection  of  land  power  is  the  type 
of  mission  that  will  be  required  for  mid-intensity  conflicts,  which  some  experts  say  will  be  the 
predominant  form  of  conflict  in  the  decades  to  come.  The  mission  of  U.S.  forces  in  MIC  has  been 
described  as  "to  engage  and  defeat  traditional  armies,  navies  and  airforces  of  nations  that  choose  to 
assault  U.S.  interests  throughout  the  developing  world."  [8]  It  is  a  mission  that  will  involve  close 
interservice  coordination,  just  as  occurred  in  Operation  Desert  Storm  because  U.S.  forces  will  be 
operating  far  from  home  and  will  also  most  likely  be  outnumbered.  This  situation  does  not  mean, 
however,  that  the  United  States  can  be  expected  to  intervene  in  mid-intensity  wars  whenever  its  interests 
are  threatened.  It  is  quite  possible  that  by  the  year  2015  there  will  be  so  many  constraints  on  the  U.S. 
defense  budget  that  it  will  have  to  be  highly  selective  about  global  military  commitments. 

Low-Intensitv  Conflict 

Although  it  is  generally  agreed  that  mid-intensity  conflicts  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  the  future 
than  high-intensity  conflicts,  some  military  thinkers,  such  as  Martin  van  Creveld  and  Rod  Paschall, 
predict  that  the  next  century  will  not  see  any  type  of  conventional  warfare.  They  argue  that  such 
conventional  forms  of  battle  will  have  become  obsolete,  along  with  nuclear  war,  and  that  the  predominant 
form  of  conflict  will  be  so-called  low-intensity  conflict  (LIC).  Military  theorists  define  LIC  in  somewhat 
different  ways,  but  it  is  generally  accepted  as  conflict  at  the  lowest  level  of  the  operational  continuum. 
According  to  Rod  Paschall,  low  intensity  conflict  is  armed  conflict  for  political  purposes  short  of  combat 
between  regularly  organized  forces.  [20]  Although  LIC  typically  does  not  involve  regular  armies  on  both 
sides,  it  could  involve  a  conventional  army  on  one  side  and  guerilla  forces  on  the  other.  The  term  first 
appeared  in  the  1980s  and  has  been  used  to  describe  several  previous  U.S.  engagements,  including  those 
that  occurred  in  Lebanon,  Grenada,  Iran,  Panama,  El  Salvador,  the  Philippines,  and  Libya.  Van  Creveld 
also  classifies  the  war  in  Vietnam  as  an  LIC.  [21]  LICs  tend  to  erupt  in  less  developed  parts  of  the  world 
and  they  are  often  very  bloody  and  protracted.  Some  experts  define  LIC  in  broader  terms,  as  involving 
six  areas:  peacetime  contingency  operations,  peacekeeping  operations,  combating  terrorism, 
counternarcotics  operations,  counterinsurgency,  and  insurgency. 

LIC  usually  involves  special  operations  forces,  those  military  or  naval  elements  that  are  trained 


212 


and  equipped  to  conduct  or  support  insurgency,  sabotage,  psychological  operations,  counter-terrorism, 
and  commando-type  operations.  They  also  perform  rescue,  reconnaissance,  and  intelligence-gathering 
functions.  Although  part  of  the  armed  forces,  they  are  not  designed  for  regular  combat.  These  forces 
played  a  crucial  role  in  the  war  with  Iraq,  although  of  course,  this  was  a  mid-intensity  conflict  rather  than 
an  LIC.  Operating  deep  within  the  country,  they  disrupted  internal  communications  and  located  scud 
missile  lauchers  so  that  they  could  be  destroyed  by  allied  forces.  Special  forces  will  become  even  more 
important  in  the  future,  playing  a  role  in  military  operations  of  all  levels  of  intensity. 

Paschall  predicts  a  substantial  increase  in  special  operations  forces  in  the  early  part  of  the  next 
century,  as  well  as  unprecedented  levels  of  performance  as  a  result  of  technological  advances  and  better 
training.  On  balance,  he  observes,  technological  trends  are  favoring  the  terrorist,  the  special  operations 
unit,  and  the  insurgent  as  the  21st  century  approaches.  First  of  all,  trends  in  the  world’s  industries  will 
make  them  more  vulnerable  to  sabotage  and  terrorism.  We  can  expect  to  see  larger  nuclear  power  plants, 
telecommunications  centers,  and  manufacturing  facilities  for  pesticides  and  toxic  chemicals.  Airplanes 
will  most  likely  increase  considerably  in  terms  of  passenger  capacity.  Secondly,  the  greater  effectiveness 
of  new  items  that  a  human  can  carry  or  wear  —  shoulder-fired  weapons,  rations,  communications 
equipment  and  terrorist  devices  --  and  the  fact  that  manned  war  machines  are  becoming  prohibitively 
expensive  to  produce  favors  the  terrorist  or  insurgent.  Paschall  portrays  a  future  world  where  men  who 
stand  on  the  ground  with  weapons  in  their  hands  defeat  mechanized  armies.  [20] 

Paschall  and  others  see  an  end  to  the  essentially  bi-polar  geopolitical  world  by  2015,  a 
development  which  should  reduce  super-power  tension.  War  will  still  occur,  but  it  will  take  place 
primarily  in  the  Third  World  and  will  most  likely  be  low-intensity  conflict.  Insurgent  movements-often 
based  on  urban  underground  movements--will  be  the  prime  instigators  of  LICs,  but  they  may  draw  in  the 
super-powers.  The  potential  for  United  States  involvement  will  escalate  correspondingly  as  diverse 
forces—religion,  nationalism,  hunger,  population  growth,  scarce  resources—erode  the  ability  of  Third- 
World  states  to  govern.  Also,  Third-World-sponsored  terrorist  attacks  against  westerners  will  increase, 
and,  according  to  another  source,  counter-narcotics  operations  will  become  increasingly  important.  [1] 

Before  Operation  Desert  Storm,  van  Creveld  went  much  further,  arguing  that  conventional 
warfare  is  on  its  way  out  because  modern  weapons  are  becoming  so  dependent  on  complex  technology 
for  maintanence  and  logistic  support  and  so  big,  expensive,  and  unmanueverable  that  contempory  war 
is  becoming  a  less  viable  alternative.  Conventional  wars  depend  on  stable  governments  and  their  armies, 
but  it  will  be  increasingly  difficult  for  states  to  retain  a  monopoly  on  violence,  largely  because  of  the 
growth  of  terrorism  and  insurgency,  which  threatens  directly  the  viability  of  the  state.  As  van  Creveld 
describes  it,  states  will  gradually  and  spasmodically  lose  their  monopoly  on  armed  violence  and  will  be 
confronted  with  widespread  outbreaks  of  unrest  and  violent  upheavals,  similar  to  those  that  occurred  in 
Europe  during  the  Reformation.  Distinctions  between  war  and  crime,  soldiers  and  civilians  will  no  longer 
exist.  The  first  to  be  affected  will  be  states  in  Asia,  Africa,  the  Caribbean,  and  Latin  America,  but  larger 
entities  like  the  Soviet  Union,  China  and  India  will  also  be  affected  by  this  process. 

Van  Creveld  describes  a  world  where  by  2015,  battles  will  be  replaced  by  skirmishes,  bombings, 


213 


and  massacres,  and  military  bases  will  be  replaced  by  hideouts  and  dumps.  "The  spread  of  sporadic, 
small-scale  war,"  he  claims,  "will  cause  regular  armed  forces  themselves  to  change  form,  shrink  in  size, 
and  wither  away... much  of  the  day-to-day  burden  of  defending  society  against  the  threat  of  low  intensity 
conflict  will  be  transferred  to  the  booming  security  business."  [21]  Surveillance  technology  will  not 
necessarily  be  able  to  suppress  subversion  and  LIC.  Van  Creveld  argues  that  information-recording  and 
transmitting  equipment  used  to  bolster  a  regime  can  be  equally  handy  in  subverting  it  and  that  devices 
declared  tamper-proof  by  their  manufacturers  will  still  be  tampered  with.  Subversion,  therefore,  will 
become  a  major  problem  for  both  Western  and  Third  World  governments. 


IMPACT  OF  TECHNOLOGY 
Conventional  Warfare 

Technological  developments  will  have  a  tremendous  impact  on  military  science  in  the  future,  even 
if  investment  in  defense  technology  is  curtailed  because  of  budgetary  constraints.  New  technology  will 
not  necessarily  change  the  nature  of  war,  but  in  many  significant  ways  it  will  change  the  battlefield  on 
which  war  will  be  waged.  There  will  be  several  areas  where  machines  will  replace  personnel  on  the 
battlefield  by  the  year  2015.  Thus,  for  example,  there  will  be  unmanned  "tel -operated"  vehicles, 
remotely  controlled  at  a  safer  location,  that  carry  surveillance  sensors  or  weapons  into  areas  too 
dangerous  for  humans.  Robotic  machines,  which  are  stronger  and  faster  than  humans  and  do  not  tire  or 
require  food  or  water,  will  replace  human  crew  members  to  perform  such  tasks  as  loading  ammunition 
in  howitzers  and  tanks.  By  2015  robotic  machines  could  well  play  such  military  roles  as  reconnaissance, 
urban  warfare,  anti-armor  attack,  minefield  sweeping,  warning  and  monitoring  logistics,  sentry  duty  and 
explosive-ordnance  disposal.  [28]  Given  the  fact  the  the  United  States  and  several  other  Western 
governments  are  now  actively  pursuing  research  in  this  area,  we  might  expect  extensive  military 
application  of  robotics  in  the  future. 

As  part  of  a  trend  towards  greater  automation  of  warfare,  the  microprocessor  will  deploy  smart 
weapons  on  a  more  comprehensive  scale.  Computers  will  continue  to  replace  human  intervention  and 
there  will  be  more  automated,  long-distance  decisions.  The  battlefield  of  the  future  will  be  fully 
computerized.  Advances  in  computer  architecture  and  machine  intelligence  will  have  reached  the  point 
where  weapons  will  have  the  ability  to  analyze  their  environment  and  current  battle  situation,  search  likely 
target  areas,  detect  and  analyze  targets,  make  attack  decisions,  select  and  dispense  munitions  and  report 
results. 

The  U.S.  military  is  at  present  on  the  verge  of  a  revolution  in  conventional  combat  capability  and 
soon  will  have  long-range  strike  systems  that  can  kill  hard  mobile  targets,  with  delivery  systems  that  are 
either  air-  or  surface-launched  and  either  launch-and-leave  or  man-in-the-loop.  The  combination  of  high 
survivability  and  the  massing  of  lethal  firepower  will  make  such  weapons  dominant  in  most  battle 


214 


situations.  As  one  source  points  out,  "The  fusing  of  advanced  sensors  with  brilliant  weapons  and 
battlefield  management  systems  will  bring  a  technological  revolution  on  the  battlefields  of  the  next 
century."  [8]  One  question  that  arises  is  whether,  as  some  predict,  these  new  technologies  will  restore 
supremacy  to  the  defensive  and  mark  the  end  of  the  tank’s  importance  or  whether  these  technologies  will 
place  a  premium  on  rapid,  stealthy  action,  and  offensive  operations.  Most  experts  agree,  however,  that 
conventional  warfare  will  be  increasingly  global  in  scope  because  of  the  technological  sophistication  and 
range  of  future  weapons. 


The  Nuclear  Arena 

SDI,  the  Strategic  Defense  Initiative,  could  put  the  defense  against  nuclear  weapons  completely 
in  the  hands  of  technology.  Military  experts  are  still  arguing  about  whether  SDI  is  feasible  and  cost- 
effective,  and  the  final  word  may  not  come  for  some  time.  Some  say  that  it  is  unthinkable  for  the  United 
States  to  deploy  such  a  system  because  it  would  be  totally  automatic,  vulnerable  to  counter-measures  and 
have  to  perform  completely  flawlessly,  which  might  be  a  problem  since  its  elements  might  be  on-orbit 
for  years  before  use.  One  computer  expert  claims,  "Computer  simulation  of  global  nuclear  war  will 
never  be  accurate  enough  for  us  to  design  a  shield  against  nuclear  weapons  because  we  simply  do  not 
know  enough  about  what  might  happen  in  such  a  conflict."  [23]  But  others,  including  Defense  Secretary 
Cheney,  disagree.  Cheney  is  optimistic  about  the  future  of  SDI,  noting  that  systems  under  development, 
such  as  Brilliant  Pebble  (a  missile  interceptor  deployed  in  a  low  space  orbit)  could  make  a  missile  attack 
on  the  United  States  too  difficult  for  any  enemy  to  risk  in  the  future  [3]. 

Space 


Although  military  applications  of  space  have  traditionally  focused  on  strategic  intelligence 
gathering  and  nuclear  deterrence,  there  is  a  growing  trend  towards  providing  space  support  for 
conventional  military  operations.  With  the  decline  of  the  nuclear  threat  from  the  Soviet  Union,  we  might 
expect  this  trend  to  continue  in  the  21st  century.  Space  support  will  serve  as  a  means  of  providing  a 
rapid,  reliable  warning  of  regional  conflagration,  along  with  a  rapid  response.  Space  will  most  likely  be 
the  "high  ground  of  conventional  combat, "  providing  rapid  communications  and  being  base  independent. 
Supercomputers  aboard  satellites,  which  are  less  vulnerable  to  communications  interference,  will  enable 
the  U.S.  military  to  have  self-reliant  reconnaissance  satellites  that  can  choose  their  own  targets  in  that 
case  where  ground-based  systems  are  knocked  out  in  a  war.  Artificial  intelligence  techniques  will  permit 
automatic  identification  of  objects  in  satellite  photos--as  a  result  of  the  development  of  high-speed, 
integrated  circuitry,  which  will  enable  spy  satellites  to  carry  on-board  computers  that  perform  the  bulk 
of  image-processing  before  the  data  is  beamed  to  the  ground.  Computerized  surveillance  will  continue 
to  diminish  the  possibility  of  surprise  attack.  For  navigation,  U.S.  naval  forces  will  have  a  global 


215 


navigation  system  of  unprecedented  accuracy.  In  the  early  21st  century,  a  wide  range  of  communications 
satellite  communications  will  be  supporting  conventional  forces. 

One  issue  that  will  become  important  to  U.S.  military  science  is  that  of  extending  the  battlefield 
itself  into  space.  Space  offers  the  perspective  to  locate  and  track  potential  enemy  targets  and  to  support 
their  engagement.  Basically  there  are  three  types  of  space-related  fire  support  that  might  be  developed 
in  the  future:  surface-to-space  weapon  systems  (ground-based  lasers  or  ground-launched  antisatellite 
missiles);  space-to-space  weapons  systems  (killer  satellites);  and  space-to-surface  weapons  systems  (space- 
based  laser  or  orbiting  missile/projectile  launch  platform).  [10]  It  clearly  is  not  beyond  the  realm  of 
technological  possibility,  but  military  planners  have  thus  far  shown  little  enthusiasm  for  using  space 
systems  for  purposes  beyond  defense  and  surveillance  and  reconnaissance.  A  key  consideration  here  is 
of  course  the  vast  cost  of  developing  the  technology  for  space  warfare.  The  deployment  and  use  of 
weapon  systems  in  space  is  a  very  sensitive  issue  because  of  the  time,  resources,  and  effort  required. 
Thus  extending  the  battlefield  into  space  will  depend  heavily  on  economic  factors. 


TRAINING  AND  COMMAND 
Manpower  and  Force  Structure 

By  the  year  2015  the  advanced  technology  of  the  U.S.  military  will  provide  the  maximum 
warfighting  potential  from  less  manpower.  A  smaller,  home-based,  highly  professional  army  will  be  the 
order  of  the  day.  Defense  Secretary  Richard  Cheney  has  stressed  that  force  levels  envisioned  by  him  and 
other  planners  for  the  Pentagon’s  long-range  strategy  represent  "an  absolute  rock-bottom  minimum."  [3] 
Pressures  to  reduce  the  size  of  U.S.  forces  will  continue  well  into  the  next  decades.  Force  levels  could 
be  down  by  one  third  to  one  half  by  the  year  2015.  This  condition  means  that  recruitment  will  be  geared 
to  attracting  young  men  and  women  with  the  high  qualities  necessary  to  perform  efficiently  and  to  grasp 
the  new  military  technologies.  Reducing  the  force  levels  should  give  the  U.S.  military  the  opportunity 
to  be  selective  and  to  offer  an  attractive  career  package  to  prospective  recruits.  Given  the  changing  ethnic 
composition  of  the  U.S.  population,  the  pool  from  which  recruits  will  be  taken  will  be  composed  of  a 
much  higher  proportion  of  blacks  and  Hispanics  than  is  the  case  currently.  Women  will  continue  to 
increase  proportionately  as  a  component  of  the  armed  forces. 

Assuming  that  U.S.  military  science  will  continue  to  adhere  to  the  doctrine  of  AirLand  Battle 
Future  in  2015,  the  army  will  have  three  types  of  forces:  1)  forward-deployed  and  contingency  forces 
2)  strategic  reserve  forces  and  3)  mobilization  forces.  The  latter  is  the  force  required  to  win  a  major 
world  conflict  and  consists  of  units  that  exist  only  in  force  planning  documents.  In  accordance  with  the 
ALBF  doctrine,  these  forces  would  be  supplemented  by  allied  troops.  It  is  unlikely  that  in  the  future  the 
United  States  will  have  a  contingency  force  large  enough  to  sustain  more  than  one  deployed  contingency 
corps.  This  means  that  the  reserve  forces  must  be  prepared  to  reinforce  larger  contingency  operations. 


216 


Most  experts  agree  that  the  force  readiness  requirement  will  not  be  fulfilled  by  the  active  forces.  It  does 
not  follow,  however,  that  the  reserve  forces  should  be  structured  to  fight  and  win  in  all  types  of  intensity 
combat,  including  special  operations.  The  reserve  capabilities  in  the  future  should  be  focused  on  those 
areas  where  the  United  States  has  a  comparative  advantage,  such  as  fire  support  intelligence/electronic 
warfare,  and  command  and  control. 

Because  the  United  States  will  not  be  able  to  maintain  large,  specialized  forces  for  every 
geographical  area  and  type  of  combat,  the  army  of  2015,  according  to  one  recent  study,  must  be  versatile, 
deployable,  and  lethal  to  fulfill  its  strategic  roles.  [15]  Versatility  includes  "the  right  mix  of  active, 
reserve,  heavy,  light,  and  special  operations  forces,  sustainment  stocks  and,  above  all,  high  quality  in  all 
aspects  of  the  force."  [15]  Because  of  U.S.  interests  around  the  world  and  its  coalition-based  strategy, 
U.S.  units  will  be  required  to  deploy  often  with  little  warning  time.  The  army  of  the  future  must  be 
lethal  in  order  to  defeat  the  enemy  as  quickly  as  possible.  This  will  require,  above  all,  an  army  trained 
for  combat  readiness,  which  means  that  the  army  must  support  and  maintain  tough,  realistic  training 
programs. 

Command  and  Control 

Judging  from  current  trends,  it  might  be  expected  that  the  pattern  of  command  and  control  that 
was  established  by  the  Goldwater-Nichols  act,  which  gives  the  commanders  in  the  field  much  greater 
authority  and  stresses  cooperation  among  the  services,  will  continue.  This  trend  will  be  promoted  by 
technological  developments  and  by  force  structures-the  leaner,  better  equipped  military  force  of  the 
future  will  lend  itself  to  a  more  stream-lined  command  and  control  system  and  better  interservice 
coordination.  And  the  logistics  of  command  and  control  on  the  battlefield  will  be  much  more 
technologically  sophisticated.  Conversely,  the  growing  range  and  accuracy  of  many  weapons  systems  will 
continue  to  bring  sea,  air,  and  land  battles  closer  together,  raising  the  requirements  for  coordination  of 
the  services  and  the  integration  of  command  and  control. 

The  projected  increase  in  reconnaissance,  surveillance,  and  target  acquistion  capabilities  will  raise 
the  demands  on  command,  control,  and  communications  considerably,  regardless  of  the  level  of  intensity 
of  the  conflict.  The  battlefield  of  the  future  will  be  much  more  complex.  Commanders  and  their  staffs 
will  have  to  be  much  better  prepared  to  handle  vastly  increased  quantities  of  data  and  information.  If, 
as  some  analysts  predict,  future  battlefields  will  be  characterized  by  separate  units  fighting  smaller, 
independent  battles,  this  will  impose  even  greater  demands  on  the  command  and  control  systems.  [18] 
There  might  also  be  a  greater  tension  between  the  centralization  that  will  characterize  command  and 
control  at  the  higher  levels  and  the  decentralization  that  will  exist  in  future  battlefields.  Another  problem 
that  might  arise  is  that,  despite  immense  progress  in  creating  multiple  forms  of  communication  and  in 
improving  resistance  to  jamming  and  hardening  command  sites,  the  C3  system  will  continue  to  be 
vulnerable.  Dependence  on  communication  satellites  will  increase  that  vulnerability.  Also,  the  problem 
of  communications  among  allies  on  future  battlefields  will  continue  to  create  difficulties,  particularly  as 


217 


technologies  become  more  diverse  and  numerous.  In  short,  command  and  control  on  the  battlefield  of 
the  future,  where  complex  communications  channels  must  be  integrated  and  coordinated,  will  present 
continued  challenges. 

TRENDS  AND  FINDINGS 

Military  science  by  the  year  2015  will  be  heavily  influenced  by  the  geopolitical,  technological, 
economic,  and  social  changes  that  will  have  taken  place.  If  present  trends  continue,  the  United  States 
will  not  become  isolationist.  On  the  contrary,  the  increasing  globalization  of  problems  and  issues  will 
draw  the  United  States  into  an  array  of  interregional  and  international  alignments  created  for  dealing  with 
environmental,  economic,  and  military  challenges.  Competition  of  course  will  continue,  particularly  in 
technological,  economic  and  defense  spheres.  But  there  will  be  a  growing  perception  in  the  United  States 
and  the  Western  world  of  the  need  for  widespread  cooperation  on  a  wide  range  of  issues. 

Military  science  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  other  geopolitical  concerns.  Defense  experts 
will  no  longer  be  thinking  primarily  in  terms  of  military  superiority  and  military  victory,  but  also  in  terms 
of  political,  environmental,  and  economic  consequences  of  military  operations.  The  legacy  of  the  war 
with  Iraq,  which  has  resulted  in  unforetold  environmental,  political,  and  societal  consequences,  could  well 
mark  the  beginning  of  an  era  where  military  decisions  are  circumscribed  by  non-military  concerns  more 
than  ever  before.  Domestic  pressures,  such  as  budgetary  constraints  and  environmental  considerations, 
will  press  the  U.S.  military  further  in  this  direction. 

United  States  military  policy  will  still  rest  on  a  power  projection  mission,  and  superiority  in 
technological  advances  will  ensure  that  the  United  States  remains  a  superpower.  But  the  old  bi-polar 
concepts  will  have  long  been  discarded,  and  technology  will  also  have  altered  the  balance  of  power  and 
the  nature  of  the  perceived  threat.  Smaller  countries,  particularly  those  with  unstable  governments  and 
nuclear  or  chemical  weapons,  will  pose  growing  challenges.  Even  the  third-rate  powers  will  have 
weapons  of  unlimited  reach  and  lethality.  Terrorism  and  insurgency  will  give  rise  to  more  involvement 
by  the  U.S.  military  in  LICs.  Military  science  will  no  longer  be  preoccupied  with  scenarios  for  nuclear 
or  high-intensity,  global  warfare,  but  rather  with  regional,  less  intense  conflicts. 

Arms  control  will  continue  to  have  a  crucial  impact  on  U.S.  military  science  and  defense 
policymaking.  Despite  setbacks  that  have  recently  occurred  in  negotiations  between  the  Soviet  Union  and 
the  United  States,  in  the  longer  term  we  will  probably  see  substantial  cuts  in  the  nuclear  arsenals  of  both 
superpowers.  Hard  choices  will  have  to  be  made  by  both  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  in 
deciding  what  weapons  systems  will  have  priority  because  both  will  be  making  decisions  under  the 
pressure  of  budgetary  constraints.  More  attention  will  be  devoted  to  preventing  smaller  governments 
from  acquiring  nuclear  weapons.  As  one  expert  observed  "it  is  highly  likely  that  the  major  powers  will 
cooperate  more  and  more  to  damp  down  dangers  they  see  in  regions  of  the  world  where  their  interests 
may  be  threatened."  [25]  By  2015  nuclear  proliferation  could  be  seen  as  the  foremost  threat  facing  the 
world,  in  which  case  arms-control  agreements  will  be  the  key  to  protecting  the  political  and  economic 


218 


interests  of  the  United  States.  It  is  also  possible,  however,  that  conflict  will  be  taking  place  outside  the 
arena  of  governments  and  will  have  shifted  to  the  low-intensity  variety.  This  prospect  will  give  major 
powers  even  more  cause  to  pool  their  resources  and  influence  in  the  interests  of  regional  and  global 
security.

KEY  JUDGMENTS 


GEOPOLITICS  AND  THREAT 


—  The  post-World  War  II  bi-polar  world  is  fast  disappearing.  The  conditions  that 
obtained  at  the  end  of  1945,  exaggerating  the  pre-eminence  of  two  powers,  have  virtually  disappeared 
with  the  end  of  Cold  War  bloc  confrontation. 

—  Europe  will  no  longer  be  the  center  of  political  interest  between  the  nuclear  powers. 
Former  "client"  states,  most  of  which  are  located  in  the  developing  world,  are  well-armed  and  equipped, 
and  may  pose  security  threats  to  the  developed  world.  These  potential  regional  hegemons  will  feel  free 
to  pursue  their  own  goals.  Recognizing  that  ideology,  religion,  and  territory  still  play  significant  roles 
in  relations  between  countries,  the  world  is  entering  upon  a  very  unsettled  time.  The  world’s  hierarchy 
of  nations  will  be  challenged. 

—  The  relationship  between  a  nation’s  military  power  and  its  economy  is  being  re¬ 
evaluated.  Whether  it  will  be  possible  to  be  an  economic  power  without  translating  that  into 
military/political  muscle  will  be  a  question  of  debate  for  coming  decades. 

—  The  massive  use  of  nuclear-based  military  force  is  becoming  obsolete.  Nuclear 
weapons  have  served  to  stabilize  the  boundaries  in  Europe.  The  entrenchment  of  interest  in  preserving 
postwar  prosperity  can  balance  the  deterrent  effect  of  World  War  II  memories. 

—  The  concepts  of  geography  and  territory  are  taking  on  new,  nontraditional  meanings. 
Geographical  features  are  no  longer  an  impediment  to  an  attacking  opponent  because  of  modern  weapons 
delivery  systems.  Transnational  or  global  issues  are  emerging  that  know  no  state  boundaries:  global 
pollution  and  environmental  degradation  (nuclear  accidents  and  oil  spills)  transcend  national  borders. 

—  The  interdependence  of  world  economies  and  markets  is  intensifying  and  leading  to 
further  decentralization.  This 

greater  interdependence  is  bringing  closer  coordination  between  nation-states.  The  information 
technology  revolution  is  enhancing  and  enlarging  the  role  of  individuals  in  world  and  national  affairs. 
Remote  villages  can  view  the  world  scene. 

-  There  is  a  definite  shift  to  the  Pacific  Rim  and  away  from  Europe.  The  Asian-Pacific 
Rim  is  America’s  largest  export  market.  The  security  threat  to  the  United  States  is  not  present  in  Europe. 
The  potential  for  security  concerns  in  the  Pacific  Rim  area  is  high:  the  Korean  peninsula  is  not  stable, 
China  will  modernize  its  military,  Japan  is  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  international  trading  economy, 
and  Indonesia  is  not  socially  or  politically  stable. 

—  Two  powerful  trends  are  demography  and  technology,  each  driving  the  other.  The 
developed  world,  the  "North,"  is  graying:  its  population  is  getting  older  and  its  fertility  rate  is  dropping. 
The  developing  world,  the  "South,"  is  young  and  growing  very  fast.  Great  pressure  is  being  exerted  on 


222 


the  North  through  intense  migration:  into  the  United  States  from  Central  and  South  America  and  into 
Europe  from  North  Africa  and  the  Middle  East.  This  pressure  is  altering  the  cultures  and  creating  stress 
in  the  North. 

—  In  the  year  2015  the  United  States  will  go  to  war  to  protect  its  economic  interests  and 
to  assist  its  friends.  It  will  need  to  have  highly  mobile  armed  forces,  well-equipped  with  high-technology 
weaponry.  Forces  will  need  to  have  theater-specific  capabilities  and  be  able  to  respond  quickly  to 
perceived  threats  to  American  interests.  Those  threats  will  be  primarily  economic  in  nature:  threats  to 
markets  and  natural  resources.

GEOPOLITICS  AND  THREAT  IN  2015 


The  course  of  politics  is  the  product  of  two  sets  of  forces,  impelling  and  guiding.  The 
impetus  is  from  the  past,  in  the  history  imbedded  in  a  people’s  character  and  tradition. 
The  present  guides  the  movement  by  economic  wants  and  geographical  opportunities. 
Statesmen  and  diplomatists  succeed  and  fail  pretty  much  as  they  recognize  the  irresistible 
power  of  these  forces. 

--Sir  Halford  Mackinder,  1890 


The  fog  of  peace  appears  to  have  taken  over  from  the  fog  of  war. 
-John  Roper, 

"Shaping  Strategy  without  the  Threat," 
1990,  [25] 


We  live  in  a  time  when  geopolitics  is  being  shaped  by  geoeconomics. 

-Richard  Solomon, 

Assistant  Secretary  of  State  for  Asian  Affairs,  1990  [12] 


INTRODUCTION 


Geopolitics  is  the  study  of  the  geography  of  relations  between  the  wielders  of  power.  Power 
refers  to  the  military,  economic,  and  technological  capabilities  of  states.  The  limiting  condition  of 
relations  between  states  is  war:  the  primary  reason  for  going  to  war  has  been  to  command  more 
territory.  The  greatest  threat  is  not  the  clash  of  ideologies  but  the  collision  of  forces  over  some  piece  of 
land.  Mackinder’s  comment  sums  up  the  history  of  international  relations:  the  recurring  struggle  for 
wealth  (read:  economic  surplus)  and  power  is  among  actors  who  are  confronted  by  the  dilemma  of  the 
uneven  distribution  of  natural  riches.  How  a  state  reacts  to  this  circumstance  is  determined  by  its  unique 
historical  development.  When  economic  surplus  was  based  on  agricultural  output  and  technological 
development  was  slow  or  nonexistent,  the  amount  of  economic  surplus  was  fixed  to  the  amount  of  land 
which  could  be  tilled  and  the  number  of  laborers  who  worked  it.  Historically,  the  course  to  higher 
surplus  and  greater  power  has  been  war:  one  actor  took  from  his  neighbor  the  riches  (read:  land  and 
laborers)  needed  to  increase  economic  surplus,  thereby  enhancing  his  power  and  authority  in  the  world 
system.  In  this  scheme,  geography  is  the  central  fact  of  world  politics.  The  geographer  emphasizes  the 
defense  that  geography  offers  against  the  ambitions  of  rivals.  [23]  Even  with  the  advent  of  industrial 
economies  and  rapid  technological  development,  geopoliticians  still  analyze  international  relations  in  terms 
of  territoriality. 

But  geopolitics  is  only  one  way  of  analyzing  the  relations  between  peoples  and  nation-states. 


224 


Many  now  believe  that  a  new  era  has  dawned  in  which  the  use  of  military  force  has  been  reduced  in 
efficacy  and  that  peaceful  evolution  has  replaced  military  conflict  in  adjusting  relations  between  states. 
These  analysts  maintain  that  domestic  economic  and  welfare  goals  have  triumphed  over  the  traditional 
power  and  security  objectives  of  nation-states.  They  see  a  world  that  has  become  so  interdependent 
because  of  technological  advances  in  information  processing  and  international  trade  that  the  nation-state 
system,  dominant  since  the  Treaty  of  Westphalia  ended  the  Thirty  Years  War  in  1648,  has  become 
obsolete. 

Another  group  holds  that  the  nation-state  system  is  still  strong  and  long-lasting  and  that  national 
security  and  power  remain  primary  state  objectives.  They  recognize,  however,  that  the  theory  enunciated 
by  Mackinder  in  1904  in  "The  Geographical  Pivot  of  History,"  no  longer  has  its  original  potency  because 
of  the  development  of  modern  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Since  1945  the  political  significance  of  the 
geographical  configuration  of  continents  and  oceans  is  no  longer  relevant  because  it  has  become  possible 
to  project  terrific  firepower  over  great  distances  without  conquering  strategic  land  or  dominating 
strategically  located  seas  and  oceans.  [28] 

The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  determine  potential  threats  to  the  security  of  the  United  States 
and  to  project  the  various  circumstances  under  which  the  United  States  will  go  to  war  in  the  year  2015. 
This  will  be  done  through  the  identification  and  analysis  of  trends  in  world  politics  and  the  international 
system  and  by  pinpointing  those  factors  that  will  effect  changes  in  those  trends,  the  so-called  "change 
drivers."  Finally,  the  study  focuses  on  the  implications  of  these  trends  for  the  United  States  Army  in 
order  to  assist  the  military  in  meeting  whatever  threat  may  present  itself  to  the  nation. 


IDENTIFICATION  OF  TRENDS 

This  study  identifies  four  trends  continuing  into  the  next  century: 

1.  The  post-World  War  II  bi-polar  world  is  fast  disappearing. 

2.  The  massive  use  of  nuclear-based  military  force  is  becoming 
obsolete. 

3.  The  concepts  of  geography  and  territory  are  taking  on  new,  nontraditional 

meanings. 

4.  The  interdependence  of  world  economies  and  markets  is  intensifying  and 

leading  to  further  decentralization. 

The  analysis  of  these  trends  and  the  factors  which  may  intensify  or  alter  their  development  (the  "change 
drivers")  will  lead  to  a  projection  of  future  scenarios  for  possible  geopolitical  developments. 

1.  The  post-World  War  II  bi-polar  world  is  fast  disappearing. 

Americans  became  aware  of  geopolitics  in  December  1941.  The  historical  isolationist  pattern  of 
American  policy,  namely,  to  stay  home  and  tend  to  business  and  let  the  Old  World  have  its  squabbles, 
even  after  World  War  I,  ended  with  the  bombing  of  Pearl  Harbor.  Americans  understood  with  immediate 


225 


clarity  that  the  oceans  could  no  longer  protect  them  from  events  occurring  in  other  areas  of  the  world. 
The  writings  of  Sir  Halford  Mackinder  were  known  only  to  professional  geographers  before  1941,  but 
he  became  a  household  name  as  American  involvement  in  the  war  continued. 

Mackinder’s  "Heartland"  theory  and  Karl  Haushofer’s  geographical  determinism,  which  formed 
the  theoretical  underpinning  to  Hitler’s  march  to  the  east,  ultimately  became  the  foundation  for  American 
postwar  policy  for  a  bi-polar  world:  containment  of  the  USSR.  When  this  policy  was  enunciated  in  1947 
the  worst  was  yet  to  come:  the  Communist  Revolution  in  China.  The  Mackinder  nightmare  came  to  life 
as  the  Eurasian  land  mass  was  united  for  the  first  time  in  modern  history  under  the  same  ideological  flag. 
The  greatest  land  power  on  the  globe  commanded  the  greatest  natural  fortress  on  earth. 

The  American  reaction  to  this  development  was  "containment":  confront  the  Russians  at  any 
point  where  they  might  gain  influence.  This  has  been  the  central  policy  of  the  United  States  for  the  last 
forty-four  years.  This  policy  has  been  successful  and  has  provided  the  framework  for  the  development 
of  a  strong  worldwide  free  market  economy.  The  essential  contribution  by  the  United  States  to  the 
interdependent  world  economic  picture  has  been  the  creation  and  enforcement  of  rules  protecting  private 
property  rights.  Property  rights  are  a  set  of  economic  and  social  relations  among  industries  defining  the 
position  of  each  industry  with  respect  to  utilization  of  scarce  resources.  [31]  The  nation-state  is  the  only 
actor  capable  of  establishing  stable  property  rights. 

Each  power  formed  its  own  bloc,  and  the  world  was  effectively  divided  into  two  ideological 
camps.  The  Cold  War  ensued.  Given  the  changes  in  the  relationship  between  the  two  powers  in  the  past 
year,  it  is  clear  that  the  bi-polarity  of  the  international  system  is  in  flux.  The  Warsaw  Pact  has  been 
dissolved,  and  the  economic  crisis  in  the  Soviet  Union  has  caused  that  nation  to  discontinue  its  support 
for  its  allies  and  client-states  and  withdraw  from  "foreign  adventures"  to  concentrate  on  its  own  domestic 
ills. 

Robert  Gilpin  defines  the  international  system  as  the  aggregate  of  diverse  entities  united  by 
regulated  interaction  according  to  a  form  of  control  (for  example,  imperial/hegemonic,  bi-polar,  and 
balance-of-power).  [10]  Despite  the  anarchic  nature  of  the  system  (there  is  no  formal  global 
government),  there  is  a  high  degree  of  order  among  states  because  the  system  exercises  an  element  of 
control  over  behavior:  it  rests  on  the  distribution  of  power  among  political  coalitions  --  it  determines  who 
governs  and  whose  interests  are  to  be  promoted.  Throughout  history  the  periods  of  relative  peace  and 
stability  are  those  in  which  the  prestige  hierarchy  has  been  clearly  understood  and  unchallenged.  The 
post-1945  era  is  such  a  period:  the  two  powers  have  rarely  challenged  each  other  directly  to  the  point  of 
full-scale  war.  Nuclear  weapons  have  essentially  rendered  such  war  obsolete:  to  date  neither  side  has 
been  able  to  figure  out  how  to  use  them  without  global  annihilation. 

The  disappearance  of  the  bi-polar  world  presages  two  developments.  One,  as  a  consequence  of 
the  collapse  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  reunification  of  Germany,  Europe  will  no  longer  the  center  of 
political  interest  between  the  nuclear  powers.  Many  analysts  have  written  about  the  end  of  the  Cold  War 
or  have  speculated  about  the  "end  of  history."  Because  the  nuclear  powers  are  no  longer  consistently  at 
odds  and  are  cooperating  in  international  arenas,  their  "client  states,"  promoted  and  armed  by  both  sides, 


226 


have  been  left  with  significant  amounts  of  weaponry  and  are  free  to  pursue  their  own  regional  hegemonic 
goals.  Recognizing  that  ideology,  religion,  and  territory  still  play  significant  roles  in  the  relations 
between  countries,  analysts  believe  the  world  is  entering  upon  a  very  unsettled  time.  The  hierarchy  will 
be  challenged  by  these  would-be  regional  hegemons. 

The  second  development  growing  out  of  the  disappearance  of  the  bipolar  world  is  a  reevaluation 
of  the  relationship  between  a  nation’s  economy  and  its  military  power.  The  Soviet  Union  is  perceived 
to  be  a  one-dimensional  superpower  (its  superpower  status  is  based  primarily  on  its  possession  of  a 
nuclear  arsenal  without  the  economic  strength  to  support  itself).  Some  analysts  believe  it  is  possible  to 
be  a  world  power  on  the  basis  of  economic  power  alone.  Germany  and  Japan  are  held  as  two  examples 
of  this  phenomenon.  Both  nations  play  major  roles  in  the  economies  of  other  Western  countries  and  soon 
will  do  the  same  in  the  former  East  Bloc.  While  it  is  widely  recognized  that  both  countries  could  become 
military  powers  if  they  chose  to  do  so  and  much  of  the  prestige  they  garner  is  based  on  that 
understanding,  it  must  be  recognized  that  economic  power  can  play  the  role  it  does  because  the  economic 
and  political  order  was  created  and  defended  militarily  by  the  United  States. 

The  changing  world  economy  is  producing  regional  powers.  In  the  East  Asian  region,  widely 
recognized  as  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economic  areas,  the  combined  GNP  of  Japan,  China,  South 
Korea,  and  Taiwan  will  be  greater  than  that  of  the  United  States  in  2015.  China’s  GNP  will  exceed  that 
of  the  USSR  in  the  same  period.  The  European  Economic  Community  (EEC),  scheduled  for  market 
unification  in  1992,  will  have  a  combined  GNP  double  that  of  the  USSR  by  2015.  India’s  GNP  will 
equal  France’s,  and  Brazil’s  will  equal  that  of  the  United  Kingdom  (see  Fig.  1). 

To  date,  China  has  put  off  military  modernization,  but  it  will  undertake  such  a  program  within 
the  forecast  period.  The  emerging  regional  powers  (South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Turkey,  India,  Brazil,  Eqypt) 
will  have  formidable  stacks  of  weapons  and  possible  advanced  sytems.  The  economic  development  of 
these  newly  industrialized  nations  will  tend  to  diffuse  power  more  widely. 

The  United  States  continues  to  wield  great  economic  clout  through  international  structures  it 
created  in  the  post-World  War  II  period,  but  its  own  fiscal  difficulties  have  caused  many  at  home  and 
abroad  to  question  the  longevity  of  that  economic  force.  Some  analysts  believe  that  America’s  hegemony 
will  be  limited  to  no  more  than  the  decade  of  the  1990s.  As  a  result  of  the  end  of  the  Cold  War,  the 
indefinite  continuation  of  the  post-World  War  II  alignment  that  exaggerated  the  hegemony  of  the  United 
States  and  the  Soviet  Union,  each  within  its  own  sphere,  is  improbable.  The  further  development  of 
alternative  power  bases  leading  to  the  appearance  of  a  multi-polar  world  is  the  likely  trend.

CHANGE  DRIVER:  a)  If  the  current  trend  toward  decentralization  of  power  in  the  Soviet  Union  does 
not  continue  and  the  CPSU  and  KGB  remain  entrenched  in  power,  then  the  primary  strategic  interest  of 
the  United  States-led  Western  alliance  will  continue  to  be  focused  there.  Despite  its  domestic  economic 
and  political  turmoil,  the  Soviet  Union  will  continue  to  be  in  competition  with  the  United  States  in  the 
future  both  because  of  the  size  of  its  past  investments  in  military  technology  and  because  of  its  position 
at  the  leading  edge  of  military  technology.  But  with  authority  continuing  to  be  centralized  in  the  Party 
and  bureaucracy  (nomenklatura),  development  of  the  economically  driven  multi-polar  world  would  be 
retarded:  nuclear  hegemony  of  the  two  rival  blocs  would  remain  primary.  A  Cold  War  scenario  would 
resume  in  which  arms  control  and  nuclear  sufficiency  would  remain  pillars  of  strategy.  The  Soviets  could 
produce  alternative  patterns,  however.  These  could  include  a  reduction  in  military  expenditures  in  favor 
of  capital  investment  reducing  the  threat  to  U.S.  security,  or  there  could  be  merely  a  restraint  of  growth 
in  military  expenditures,  in  which  case  research  and  development  would  continue  and  production  could 
be  instituted  at  a  later  date  (see  Fig.  2).  [9] 

b)  If  the  Soviet  Union  reconfigures  into  a  confederation  of  nine  republics  (with  Estonia,  Latvia, 
Lithuania,  the  Ukraine,  Georgia,  and  Armenia  becoming  independent)  and  the  command-and-administer 
style  economy  is  eliminated  in  favor  of  a  modified  free  market  system,  then  a  multi-polar  global  system 
will  accelerate  multi-polar  development. 

c)  If  some  nations  of  Eastern  Europe  are  unable  to  make  the  transition  from  command  economies 
to  market  systems  and  popular  unrest  and  fears  of  anarchy  mount,  then  dictatorships  will  be  re-installed 
that  will  be  potentially  hostile  to  American  and  Western  interests.  This  scenario  would  be  the  so-called 
"Peronist"  alternative:  a  market-adaptable  economy  with  strongly  centralized  authority.  While 
nationalistic  and  opposed  to  old-style  Soviet  hegemony,  philosophically  they  would  be  non-aligned. 

2.  The  massive  use  of  nuclear-based  military  force  is  becoming  obsolete. 

Conventional  wisdom  has  it  that  nuclear  weapons  have  become  unusable:  such  weapons  are  for 
mass  suicide.  Martin  van  Creveld  has  said  that  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  have,  in  effect, 
been  "debellicized.”  [8]  It  is  widely  recognized  that  political  advancement  from  the  possession  of 
nuclear  weaponry  has  been  null:  being  the  sole  possessor  of  nuclear  power  did  not  enable  the  United 
States  to  keep  Eastern  Europe  out  of  the  Soviet  sphere  of  control,  nor  did  it  enable  the  United  States  to 
prevent  the  Communist  Revolution  in  China.  China  still  does  not  have  Taiwan  despite  its  nuclear 
capability.  Nor  has  its  entry  into  the  nuclear  club  enabled  India  to  have  its  way  in  Sri  Lanka,  where  civil 
strife  continues. 

Nuclear  weapons  have  served  to  stabilize  the  borders  in  Europe,  the  primary  area  of  superpower 
interest.  Conflicts  between  the  two  powers  since  1962  have  occurred  exclusively  at  the  periphery  of 
superpower  interests  (i.e.,  outside  Europe).  The  credibility  of  deterrence  in  Europe  had  to  do  with  the 
network  of  economic  and  political  interests,  cultural  and  institutional  ties,  and  past  commitments  that 
existed  between  each  superpower  and  its  group  of  European  allies.  The  prospective  levels  of  casualties 


229 


and  property  damage  from  conventional  warfare  alone  was  an  enormously  powerful  deterrent.  "If  the 
deterrent  effect  of  World  War  II  memories  has  faded  slightly,  the  entrenchment  of  interest  in  preserving 
postwar  prosperity  can  balance  it."  [27,p.l87] 

But  the  statement  "everyone  knows  that  nuclear  weapons  cannot  be  used"  does  not  make  it  a  fact: 
"everyone"  may  not  know  it!  There  are  other  nations  seeking  the  status  and  prestige  that  nuclear  weapons 
confer,  and  they  may  not  refrain  from  using  them.  Other  members  of  the  "nuclear  club",  not  necessarily 
self-acknowledged  members,  such  as  Israel,  Pakistan,  South  Africa,  Argentina,  Brazil,  and  perhaps  North 
Korea,  have  serious  border  disputes  with  their  neighbors  on  what  may  be  considered  "fault  lines"  of 
conflict.  One  cannot  assume  that  nuclear  weaponry  will  not  be  used  in  the  future. 

If,  however,  one  assumes  that  the  use  of  massive  force  is  not  as  powerful  an  option,  the  question 
arises  about  the  type  of  force  that  would  be  used  in  its  place.  Martin  van  Creveld  believes  that 
conventional  warfare  will  cede  its  position  to  low-intensity  conflict  (LIC).  LIC  is  defined  as  having  the 
following  characteristics:  it  unfolds  in  less-developed  areas  (LICs  in  the  developed  world  are  called 
"terrorism",  or  "police  actions");  the  participants  are  normally  guerillas,  rarely  regular  army  combat 
soldiers;  it  relies  little  on  high-tech  weaponry  (although  this  may  change  in  the  future).  [8]  The  kinds 
of  conflicts  the  world  sees  in  Lebanon,  Cyprus,  Angola,  Mozambique,  Ethiopia,  El  Salvador,  and  the 
Philippines  are  typical  of  LICs. 

While  we  believe  that  LIC  is  very  likely  the  more  typical  confrontation  in  the  future,  we  do  not 
rule  out  the  use  of  massive  forces  in  conventional  theaters  of  operation.  If  a  would-be  regional  hegemon, 
a  charismatic  leader,  with  large  army  and  wealth  of  weaponry,  comes  upon  the  world  scene  not  having 
learned  from  Saddam  Hussein’s  mistakes  and  confronts  a  major  power  under  the  terms  of  conventional 
engagement,  force  will  be  used  on  a  large  scale.

CHANGE  DRIVER:  a)  The  potential  for  massive  use  of  force  will  increase  if  ballistic  missile 
capability  proliferates  to  many  more  nation-states  (reports  of  upwards  of  25  to  30  such  states  have  been 
published)  and  these  states  themselves  have  the  technology  to  produce  or  acquire  nuclear  or 
chemical/biological  warheads.  Many  of  these  states  have  border  disputes  or  powerful  ideological  drives 
and  hatreds  to  endanger  international  stability.  Emerging  regional  powers  (South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Turkey, 
India,  Brazil,  and  Egypt)  have  formidable  stocks  of  weapons  -  possibly  advanced  systems.  They  will 
not  need  superpower  suppliers  or  approval  to  use  them. 

b)  If  a  transnational  governing  body  with  authority  to  monitor  and  verify  weapons  destruction 
emerges  and/or  the  sales  of  arms  to  Third  World  and  developing  countries  ceases,  then  the  potential  for 
massive  use  of  force  further  diminishes.  If  a  modified  and  expanded  COCOM  is  created  with  verification 
and  enforcement  provisions  and  member  states  abide  by  its  rules  and  limits,  then  less-developed  states 
will  not  easily  acquire  the  technology  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  If  the  concept  of  verification 
becomes  widely  accepted  (presently  occurring  in  arms  control  talks  between  the  superpowers),  then  there 
will  be  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  technologies  and  weapons  themselves  are  not  produced.  Arms 
control  agreements  between  the  nuclear  powers  will  reduce  current  stockpiles,  and  signatures  created  for 
nonnuclear  strategic  capability  (NNSC)  weaponry  to  prevent  nuclear  retaliation  "accidents"  will  reduce 
the  likelihood  that  massive  force  will  be  used  to  settle  disputes. 

3.  The  concepts  of  geography  and  territory  are  taking  on  new,  nontraditional  meanings. 

Two  concepts  are  at  work  in  this  trend.  First,  in  geopolitical  terms,  the  territorial  boundaries  of 
states  no  longer  have  traditional  significance  because  of  the  development  of  weapons  delivery  systems: 
geographical  features  are  no  impediment  to  an  attacking  opponent.  Therefore,  the  concept  of  security 
for  a  nation-state  has  changed  dramatically.  Second,  transnational  or  global  issues  are  emerging  that 
know  no  state  boundaries. 

Many  geopoliticians  accept  the  fact  that  geography  and  geopolitical  considerations  are,  if  not 
irrelevant,  at  least  unalterably  changed  by  the  developments  in  strategic  nuclear  technologies:  the  concept 
of  geopolitical  space  has  been  modified.  Whereas  Pearl  Harbor  ended  American  "glorious  isolation," 
the  ICBMs  of  the  1950’s  added  greater  insecurity.  When  SLBMs  were  developed,  the  vertical  parameters 
disappeared  beneath  the  surface  of  the  oceans  as  well:  no  nation-state  could  be  isolated  from  global 
involvement  anywhere.  "The  entirety  of  national  territories  is  an  open  window."  [33,  p.144] 

Another  aspect  of  this  concept  of  the  changing  understanding  of  what  territory  and  geography 
mean  is  the  emergence  of  transnational  issues.  Most  people  of  the  developed  world  have  come  to  realize 
that  there  are  events  and  issues  that  respect  no  national  borders:  air  pollution  from  Ohio  brings  acid  rain 
to  Canada,  emissions  from  power  plants  in  Czechoslovakia  and  Poland  are  destroying  the  trees  of  the 
Black  Forest  in  Germany,  the  AIDS  epidemic  has  spread  all  across  the  world  in  less  than  a  decade,  the 
breakdown  of  the  ozone  layer,  caused  by  global  pollution, 

with  potentially  devastating  environmental  ramifications,  will  affect  all  life  on  the  planet,  and  many  other 


232 


issues.  The  government  of  the  Soviet  Union  eventually  admitted  the  nuclear  meltdown  at  Chernobyl  after 
irrefutable  radiation  readings  in  Sweden  were  made  public.  The  struggle  of  the  United  States  government 
to  come  to  grips  with  the  international  drug  trade  illustrates  the  difficulty  one  government  has  in 
managing  or  controlling  an  issue  that  spans  national  borders.  These  issues  transcend  the  limits  of  a  single 
government’s  control:  many  domestic  problems  have  an  international  component. 

James  Rosenau,  author  of  a  remarkable  study  of  change  in  international  relations  entitled 
Turbulence  in  World  Politics,  has  theorized  that  one  of  the  most  fundamental  changes  in  the  relations 
between  nation-states  is  at  the  microlevel:  the  heightened  competence  of  individuals.  [26]  This  improved 
analytic  power  has  come  about  through  the  telecommunications  revolution:  even  remote  villages  in  the 
underdeveloped  world  can  receive  television  transmissions  and  see  what  is  occurring  on  the  other  side 
of  the  globe.  Individuals  have  increasingly  come  to  understand  that  certain  issues  do  not  remain  confined 
within  the  borders  of  a  single  nation-state. 

Along  with  this  development  one  sees  individuals,  coalescing  in  subgroups,  moving  away  from 
larger  governmental  institutions.  Because  of  increasing  frustration  at  the  inability  of  larger  units  to  solve 
problems,  individuals  are  forming  into  groups  to  make  their  collective  voice  heard.  These  groups  can 
take  the  form  of  a  "movement"  (a  loosely  knit  aggregate  of  like-minded  individuals  and  organizations 
seeking  to  influence  one  or  more  aspects  of  human  affairs),  e.g.  the  "women’s  movement",  the  "ecology 
movement",  or  a  "leaderless  public"  (the  convergence  of  actions  or  orientations  of  large  numbers  of 
people  with  the  absence  of  authority),  e.g.  polling  groups,  rioters.  The  public  no  longer  believes  that 
national  governments  can  solve  problems.  The  perceived  lack  of  credibility  on  the  part  of  larger 
organized  units  to  solve  dilemmas  is  leading  to  decentralization.  "Decentralizing  tendencies  lead  to  the 
proliferation  of  boundary-spanning  relationships,  thereby  undermining  hierarchy  and  intensifying  the 
volatility  of  global  authority  structures."  [26,p.l87] 

CHANGE  DRIVERS:  a)  The  ability  of  subgroups  to  effect  change  in  state  policies  will  be  an  important 
factor  in  whether  transnational  issues  come  to  dominate  the  international  agenda.  If  the  "interdependence" 
analysis  proves  correct,  then  the  multi-centric  world  will  aid  the  break  down  of  the  hegemonic 
international  system  currently  dominated  by  the  United  States.  The  effective  sovereignty  of  nation-states 
will  be  undermined  because,  as  Rosenau  has  said,  more  and  more  interactions  in  world  politics  are 
unfolding  without  the  direct  involvement  of  nations  or  states.  Symptoms  of  national  loss  of  sovereignty 
are  technological  breakthroughs  that  circumvent  national  authority  (Fax  machines,  PCs, 
telecommunications,  "smart"  terminals);  authority  crises  that  arise  as  individuals  improve  their  analytical 
capabilities;  consensus  breakdowns  that  occur  as  subgroups  emerge  to  voice  their  own  agenda. 

b)  Some  analysts  have  asserted  that  the  "superpower"  category  is  gone:  if  the  rivalry  is  removed 
the  category  vanishes.  The  category  of  "great  power"  was  associated  with  invulnerability.  "Superpower" 
came  into  being  with  nuclear  weaponry  when  it  was  no  longer  possible  to  be  invulnerable.  William  Pfaff 
has  written  that  superpower  is  not  great  power  writ  large,  but  a  different  category  of  power  characterized 
by  a  nuclear  arsenal  by  which  each  superpower  rendered  the  other  vulnerable.  [24]  If  national  boundaries 


233 


can  be  defended  against  ICBMs  and  SLBMs  as  they  were  in  the  pre-missile  era,  then  the  concept  of 
invulnerability  will  have  its  traditional  significance.  Nation-state  borders  will  have  more  meaning  again 
with  the  development  of  the  Strategic  Defense  Initiative  (SDI)  or  some  variation  thereof.  If  offensive 
missile  systems  undergo  significant  reduction  and  verification  measures  are  improved  in  the  destruction 
of  existing  stockpiles,  then  nation-states  having  ICBM  and  SLBM  capabilities  may  opt  for  defensive 
missile  systems. 

4.  The  interdependence  of  world  economies  and  markets  is  intensifying  and  leading  to  further 
decentralization. 

The  post-World  War  II  era  of  American  hegemony  has  been  termed  the  triumph  of  liberalism 
because  the  United  States  has  provided  the  public  goods  necessary  for  the  functioning  of  efficient  world 
markets.  [10]  Adam  Smith  had  argued  that  real  wealth  came  from  trade  steming  from  the  exchange  of 
goods,  not  territorial  possession.  In  the  20th  century,  the  United  States  has  continued  the  enforcement 
of  international  rules  protecting  property  rights  that  the  United  Kingdom  created  in  the  19th  century. 

As  a  result  of  financial  institutions  (The  World  Bank,  The  International  Monetary  Fund)  and  trade 
agreements  (GATT)  that  came  into  being  after  1945,  the  world  has  seen  unprecedented  growth  and 
economic  development.  The  links  between  the  world’s  economies  become  closer  all  the  time:  the  nations 
of  Western  Europe  are  on  the  threshold  of  uniting  their  markets  in  1992;  the  North  American  continent 
may  become  one  trade  zone  that  may  eventually  embrace  the  entire  western  hemisphere;  the  Japanese 
"Co-Prosperity  Sphere"  of  the  1930’s  is  seemingly  a  reality  in  the  1990’s. 

The  greater  interdependence  of  world  economies  and  the  emergence  of  transnational  issues  is 
bringing  closer  coordination  between  nation-states.  At  the  same  time  decentralization  is  occurring.  The 
need  to  deal  with  worldwide  environmental  pollution,  currency  crises,  and  terrorism  impel  greater 
cooperation  between  systems  even  as  global  television  and  communications  networks,  the  information 
revolution,  bring  about  decentralized  "loci  of  action"  enhancing  the  influence  of  subsystems  and  enlarging 
the  role  of  citizens. 

Individuals  become  frustrated  when  they  witness  the  inability  of  central  authority  to  confront 
issues  and  solve  problems.  Global  communications  media  transmit  images  of  authority  being  challenged 
elsewhere.  Legitimacy  and  authority  crises  develop  as  locals  grant  legitimacy  to  leaders  based  on 
performance  rather  than  on  the  grounds  of  historical  respect  for  the  office  held.  Authority  is  so 
decentralized  that  no  system  or  cluster  of  systems  has  control  over  outcomes:  individual  citizens  negotiate 
with  terrorists  for  the  release  of  hostages;  gangs  of  criminals  and  terrorists  deal  with  heads  of  state  as  co- 
equals.  In  the  name  of  competitiveness,  corporations  are  being  internationalized  to  an  even  greater 
extent.  United  States  companies  abandon  their  national  identities  and  say  they  are  global,  no  longer 
dependent  on  the  American  economy.  Trade  is  propelled  by  the  lure  of  markets,  not  the  flag.  A 
recession  at  home,  they  say,  does  not  impact  operations  abroad  as  it  once  did.  There  is  a  decoupling  of 
the  corporation  from  the  country.  [26] 


234 


CHANGE  DRIVERS:  a)  A  pronounced  isolationist  trend  could  produce  a  drive  to  close  a  nation-state’s 
borders  to  outside  "influences."  One  such  case  is  Iran  where,  after  the  revolution,  the  Iranian 
Revolutionary  Guards,  drawing  on  Shiite  fundamentalism,  closed  the  country  to  prevent  Western  influence 
from  "contaminating"  the  population.  Such  a  religiously  or  ideologically  based  attempt  at  autarky  could 
retard  movement  toward  interdependence,  although  it  is  unlikely  that  a  large  number  of  countries  would 
pursue  such  a  course. 

If,  however,  economic  nationalism,  always  near  the  surface,  should  appear  in  several  major 
economies  or  trading  blocs  (e.g.  the  EEC  or  Korea),  then  it  would  have  significant  impact  on  world 
interdependence.  Moves  to  stifle  importation  of  "luxury"  goods  or  products  that  compete  directly  with 
favored  domestic  industries  would  be  warning  signals  for  such  a  condition.  There  could  be  attempts  on 
the  part  of  some  states  to  "go  it  alone,"  especially  if  "outsiders"  impose  pressure  on  cultural  patterns. 
Economic  nationalism  is  possible,  but  it  is  outside  the  realm  of  the  probable. 

b)  Developments  in  high  technology,  for  example,  the  fiber-optic  network,  will  accelerate 
interdependence  through  the  spread  of  education  programs,  agricultural  assistance,  or  worldwide  weather 
forecasting.  If  ecological  degradation  of  the  planet  continues,  a  likely  prospect,  then  there  will  be  a 
global  attempt  to  deal  with  the  disposal  of  waste  products.  Such  a  development  would  foster  cooperation 
between  nation-states. 

These  four  trends  are  predicted  to  continue  into  the  first  decades  of  the  21st  century.  However, 
a  careful  examination  will  yield  possible  alternative  developments.  First,  neither  the  United  States  nor 
the  Soviet  Union  will  be  able  to  dominate  the  international  system  indefinitely,  given  post-1992  EEC 
market  unification  and  the  growing  economic  power  of  the  Pacific  Rim  countries.  Although  the  Cold 
War  as  defined  by  East-West  bloc  confrontation  is  over,  the  differences  between  the  Soviet  Union  and 
the  United  States-led  Western  alliance  will  continue  to  drive  many  world  issues:  in  the  Persian  Gulf 
region,  in  relations  with  the  Islamic  nations  (because  of  the  Soviets’  own  potentially  restive  Moslem 
population)  and  oil  supply  (the  USSR  may  be  a  petroleum  importer  in  the  very  near  term),  and  in  the 
Pacific,  where  the  Soviets  have  made  it  clear  they  intend  to  be  an  "Asian  power."  (Consider  President 
Gorbachev’s  Vladivostok  speech  1986.)  The  desire  of  the  Soviet  Union  to  be  a  force  in  world  politics 
has  not  diminished,  and  with  its  nuclear  arsenal  it  cannot  be  disregarded  as  a  major  actor.  The  Soviet 
Union,  even  with  the  most  positive  of  possible  outcomes  (i.e.,  a  full-fledged  democratic,  decentralized 
confederation  of  states)  will  have  interests  different  from  those  of  the  United  States.  While  the 
introduction  of  market-economy  reforms  into  the  Soviet  system  is  seen  as  a  desirable  goal,  a  less  autarkic 
USSR  challenging  the  United  States  in  the  world  markets  and  competing  for  scarce  resources  could  be 
destabilizing. 

In  the  longer  run  (2005-2015),  unless  the  Soviets  can  significantly  relieve  their  economic 
difficulties  and  move  toward  a  new  period  of  substantial  economic  growth,  they  will  gradually  become 
less  conspicuous  in  U.S.  policy  and  strategy.  Widely  different  developments  are  possible  for  the  Soviet 
Union  —  ranging  from  major  reductions  in  Soviet  active  forces  to  free  resources  for  economic  revival, 
to  persistent  economic  stagnation  that  constrains  military  modernization,  to  successful  economic  reform 


235 


that  positions  the  Soviets  to  compete  effectively  with  the  United  States  in  the  military-technical  revolution. 

[9] 

John  Roper’s  comment  about  the  fog  of  peace  is  particularly  appropriate  when  considering  the 
disintegration  of  the  bi-polar  world  of  post-1945.  In  fact,  the  Cold  War  was  relatively  clear:  the 
certainties  were  numerous.  As  John  Mearsheimer  has  suggested,  the  move  from  bi-polarity  to  multi¬ 
polarity  is  not  guaranteed  to  enhance  stability.  During  the  Cold  War,  bi-polarity  led  to  global  caution, 
and  regional  conflicts  were  inhibited  because  of  the  risk  of  horizontal  escalation.  The  diminution  of  bi¬ 
polarity  may  lead  to  a  proliferation  of  local  conflicts  and  local  threats.  [22] 

It  is  important  not  to  confuse  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  with  the  elimination  of  warfare  and  the 
emergence  of  universal  peace.  Some  regional  wars  have  been  short  because  of  the  inability  to  resupply 
weapons.  If  there  is  a  proliferation  of  major  supply  centers  that  could  change;  there  could  be  protracted, 
large-scale  regional  wars  supplied  by  neither  superpower.  Brazil,  Israel,  South  Korea,  China,  and  India 
all  produce  weapons  for  other  nations  and  could  supply  regional  combatants  or  conflicts  in  which  they 
themselves  are  involved.  There  were  numerous  serious  armed  conflicts  during  the  Cold  War  period, 
and  if  anything,  such  types  of  conflicts  promise  to  be  more  serious  and  more  numerous  with  the  absence 
of  two  controlling  power  blocs. 

The  multi-polar  world  is  a  turbulent  one.  By  definition  there  will  be  more  actors  and  interests 
to  be  served.  There  will  be  a  questioning  of  the  legitimacy  of  the  existing  power  hierarchy.  Because  the 
possession  of  nuclear  weapons  enchances  prestige  and  gives  rank  in  the  system,  more  countries  will  seek 
to  develop  them.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  major  powers  may  very  well  decide  to  develop  defensive 
missile  systems  to  guard  against  a  nuclear  attack  by  a  regional  hegemon.  Analysts  believe  that  a  system 
like  SDI  could  be  effective  against  a  small  nuclear  force  while  not  sufficient  to  deter  a  large  nuclear 
arsenal. 

What  do  these  scenarios  imply  for  the  U.S.  Army?  First,  to  date,  the  evolution  of  various  forms 
of  global  economic  cooperation  and  interrelationships  has  not  yielded  the  geopolitically  secure 
relationships  that  would  preclude  substantial  military  force  readiness  in  the  name  of  national  security. 
Long-term  economic  interdependency  might  encourage  geopolitical  evolution,  but  clearly  the  two 
processes  move  at  very  different  speeds.  The  advent  of  new  multinational  economic  blocs  and  the 
consolidation  of  others  such  as  the  EEC  could  have  two  effects.  Driven  partly  by  the  degree  of  overall 
expansion  and  prosperity  in  world  markets,  these  blocs  may  be  the  basis  of  geopolitical  stability  and  a 
source  of  financial  aid  to  the  increasingly  restless  "have-not"  South.  The  latter  eventuality  might  forestall 
geopolitical  conflict  with  members  of  the  "have-not"  group,  generated  by  exacerbated  economic 
disparities.  Or  economic  rivalry  for  limited  markets  may  degenerate  into  new  geopolitical  hostility  among 
the  "haves,"  negating  the  unifying  effects  of  international  communications  networks  and  trade  agreements. 
Obviously  the  first  choice  promises  substantially  greater  national  security  for  the  United  States  than  the 
second,  however  directly  the  United  States  might  be  involved  in  such  economic/geopolitical  blocs.  A 
potential  economic  bloc  with  particular  resonance  for  United  States  geopolitical  planning  would  combine 
Japanese  manufacturing  and  financial  power  with  raw  materials  from  the  Soviet  Union  and  perhaps  China. 


236 


North-South  issues  could  come  to  dominate  the  international  agenda.  The  emergence  of  global 
ecological  problems  and  limits  to  growth  go  far  beyond  individual  states.  There  will  need  to  be  a 
universal  commitment  to  a  modem  and  better  life  for  all  inhabitants  of  the  planet  because  the  limits-to- 
growth  approach  may  lead  to  bitter  fights  over  scarce  resources  and  to  the  carving  up  of  the  World 
Ocean.  There  is  no  guarantee  that  selfish  concerns  will  be  subordinated  to  the  larger  good.  On  the 
contrary,  modern  science  and  technology  may  intensify  conflicts  over  resources. 

Power  centers  will  emerge  with  cultural  and  diplomatic  traditions  far  different  from  the  once- 
dominant  West,  and  this  fact  may  presage  a  return  to  conflicts  of  the  premodern  era.  The  European 
powers  have  attempted  to  bring  the  fruits  of  the  "Enlightenment"  to  the  "uncivilized"  world  for  three 
centuries,  believing  it  to  be  their  "burden."  "The  notion  of  a  unified  humanity  does  not  exist;  it  is  the 
creation  of  a  West  trying  to  impose  its  values  on  a  set  of  diverse  cultures."  [10,  p.225]  Political 
fragmentation  will  increase  on  the  globe  because  humans  are  deeply  divided  by  race,  religion  and  wealth. 
Nationalism,  with  its  roots  in  17th  century  Europe,  is  a  predominant  faith  of  modem  man,  and  it  has 
unleashed  powerful  destructive  forces. 

The  scenarios  outlined  here  have  other  implications  for  the  army.  There  is  no  certainty  that  the 
massive  use  of  force  will  disappear.  Merely  because  the  nuclear  weapons  are  deemed  unusable  by 
"rational"  people  and/or  a  defensive  missile  system  is  developed  by  those  who  have  the  technological 
capability  and  resources  to  build  it,  other  types  of  massive  force  may  replace  nuclear  weaponry,  to  wit: 
the  nonnuclear  strategic  capability  (NNSC).  The  application  of  NNSC  to  LICs  is  increasingly  important. 
For  strategic  purposes  such  application  is  a  significant  development:  it  results  in  a  war-widening  option 
short  of  nuclear  escalation. 

It  has  been  suggested  by  some  analysts  that  U.S.  and  Soviet  military  competition  is  likely  to  focus 
increasingly  on  nonnuclear  weapons.  New  types  of  explosive  charges  have  been  developed  that  can 
make  these  weapons  as  effective  as  small  nuclear  blasts  against  most  military  targets  without  many  of  the 
consequences  associated  with  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons:  precision-guided  munitions,  fuel-air  explosives. 
This  type  of  weapons  technology  need  not  remain  limited  to  Soviet  and  U.S.  forces  only. 

The  widespread  development  of  advanced  technologies  in  the  commercial  sector  for  nondefense 
purposes  has  occurred.  Many  newly  industrialized  countries  (NICs)  are  acquiring  their  own  R&D 
capabilities.  In  addition,  co-production  schemes  enable  partners  to  acquire  advanced  technological 
processes.  The  United  States  cannot  dominate  military  situations  by  exclusive  ownership  of  an  advanced 
technology.  It  is  possible  for  countries  to  expand  this  nonmilitary  technology  into  military  applications. 

Although  Operation  Desert  Storm  was  perhaps  an  anomaly  in  terms  of  the  massing  of 
conventional  arms,  there  is  no  assurance  that  similar  events  will  not  recur.  Ongoing  developments  in 
technology  may  lead  political  figures  to  believe  that  massive  use  of  force  is  possible  without  nuclear 
escalation. 

While  the  concepts  of  geography  and  territory  have  acquired  nontraditional  values  (because  the 
industrial  and  technological  basis  of  economic  surplus  obviates  the  need  to  seize  a  neighbor’s  territory 
and  development  of  ICBMs  and  SLBMs  has,  in  effect,  opened  the  borders  of  all  nations),  the  emergence 


237 


of  transnational  issues  relating  to  ideology,  religion,  and  ethnic  origin  makes  territory  a  fundamental  issue 
between  nation-states. 

Peoples  all  over  the  globe  are  in  a  whirl  of  change,  and  they  are  increasingly  looking  to  their 
group  identities:  physical  characteristics,  name  and  language,  history  and  origin,  religion,  and 
nationality.  These  identities  frequently  cross  state  boundaries,  particularly  if  they  are  deemed  the  residue 
of  the  colonial  era.  Most  of  the  boundaries  were  not  based  on  where  peoples  actually  lived,  but  were 
artificially  drawn  by  the  colonial  powers  for  geopolitical  purposes.  These  boundaries  have  generated  the 
most  conflicts.  Examples  of  these  issues  and  their  link  to  territorial  conflict  include:  the  Arab  world, 
where  the  historical  concept  of  the  "Arab  Nation"  has  been  used  to  justify  the  attempts  by  different 
leaders  to  unify  the  area;  historical  ties  and  ethnic  unity  were  fundamental  to  the  struggle  of  North 
Vietnam  to  conquer  the  South  (the  Korean  peninsula  is  another  case);  the  Shiite  Imams  and  Mullahs  in 
Iran  have  expressed  the  desire  to  unify  the  Moslem  world.  There  are  numerous  other  examples. 

However,  many  of  these  conflicts  are  arising  in  places  where  nation-states  have  been  "united" 
for  centuries:  Western  Europe  and  North  America.  The  weakening  of  the  fabric  of  consent  (the  result 
of  Rosenau’s  microlevel  "increased  cathectic  capabilities  of  individuals"  and  the  movement  toward 
"subgroupism"  leading  to  the  questioning  of  legitimacy  and  authority)  that  had  kept  sub-national  groups 
passive  or  submissive  has  unleashed  long  pent-up  frustrations  for  linguistic,  regional,  political  autonomy 
or  a  reassertion  of  cultural  distinctiveness.  The  Scots  and  Welsh,  residents  of  Ulster,  Bretons,  Corsicans, 
Flemish  and  Walloons,  Basques,  Catalans,  and  Quebequois  are  examples  of  this  phenomenon.  Many  of 
these  peoples  are  separated  from  their  larger  group  by  state  boundaries;  hence  we  see  movements  for 
independence  within  long-established  nation-states.  Centrifugal  and  centripetal  forces  are  at  work. 

People  everywhere  are  turning  away  from  entire  systems--the  state,  society,  community~to 
smaller  collectivities.  It  has  been  said  that  the  nation-state  is  too  small  for  the  big  problems  of  life  and 
too  big  for  the  small  problems  of  life.  Whole  systems  are  too  complex  for  their  needs  and  wants,  and 
they  seek  to  regain  control  by  turning  to  subsystems.  They  hope  to  get  in  a  place  they  feel  they  belong 
and  where  they  are  grouped  with  their  own  kind  for  physical  and  emotional  safety.  That  group 
becomes  "the  nation."  The  nation  is  defined  as  the  largest  community  that,  when  the  chips  are  down, 
effectively  commands  men’s  loyalty.  [16]  The  downside  to  this  phenomenon  is  that  the  maintenance  of 
basic  consensus  required  for  effective  and  democratic  public  action  becomes  more  difficult  if  society 
divides  into  distinct  and  separate  ethnic  and  cultural  blocs.  The  capacity  to  mobilize  the  whole,  or  very 
nearly  the  whole,  of  society  for  a  national  cause  (e.g.,  war)  will  become  problematic  or  impossible  if 
cultural  diversity  produces  more  cross-purposes  and  political  deadlocks.  [21] 

Religion  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  sources  of  community  in  the  world  today.  A  major  sub¬ 
trends  is  the  unsecularization  of  the  world  in  the  late  20th  century.  Religion  is  not  going  to  fade  from 
the  scene.  It  is  a  Western  conceit  that  religion  is  an  irrational,  premodern  phenomenon;  religion, 
however,  is  becoming  a  powerful  force  in  the  United  States,  Western  and  Eastern  Europe,  and  the  Soviet 
Union.  Protestant  evangelism  is  on  the  rise  in  traditional  Roman  Catholic  Latin  America  (the  recent 
election  of  an  Evangelical  Protestant  to  the  Peruvian  presidency  bears  witness  to  the  power  of  the 


238 


movement).  Religion  serves  as  a  dominant  unifying  force  for  many  groups  and  is  a  transnational  issue 
of  significance.  It  need  not  be  a  divisive  force.  "We  must  discern  the  theological  and  political  conditions 
under  which  religion  can  serve  the  cause  of  nonviolent  conflict  resolution."  [32,  p.27] 

The  growing  interdependence  of  the  world’s  economies  does  not  necessarily  guarantee  peace. 
Economic  welfare  is  said  to  replace  national  security  as  the  principal  object  of  societies:  economic 
cooperation  has  displaced  traditional  conflict  over  territory,  balance  of  power,  the  rational  use  of 
resources.  We  are  said  to  be  in  an  era  of  international  cooperation.  Some  realist  analysts,  notably 
Kenneth  Waltz,  have  argued  that  interdependence  and  global  power  are  being  confused.  Transactions 
in  and  of  themselves  do  not  have  any  political  significance.  What  counts  is  the  ability  of  a  state  to  adjust 
to  change  or  to  use  its  economic  position  for  political  leverage.  However,  nations  are  apprehensive 

about  the  loss  of  autonomy  and  access  to  foreign  markets,  and,  as  a  result,  economic  nationalism  is  a 
potentially  disruptive  force  in  the  interdependent  global  economy.  Some  have  seen  the  rising  tension 
between  the  contrary  pulls  of  the  global  economy  and  the  national  polities  as  a  structural  problem. 
Capital  can  flow  easily;  people  cannot.  No  national  government  today  controls  its  own  capital  flows  to 
take  advantage  of  differential  interest  rates,  cheaper  labor,  and  better  investment  opportunities.  But 
people  cannot  move  as  readily  nor  are  many  countries  prepared  to  take  them.  As  jobs  slip  away,  the 
government  must  move  to  protect  either  capital  or  people.  A  large  economy  may  be  able  to  manage  these 
transitions  but  many  cannot,  and  fragmentation  because  of  economic  difficulties,  multiplied  by  ethnic 
clashes,  increases  the  chances  for  LICs.  [3] 

While  recent  decades  have  seen  the  growing  interdependence  of  national  economies--and  this  trend 
is  predicted  to  continue—there  will  need  to  be  a  focus  on  those  economies  that  have  not  participated  in 
the  exchange.  William  McNeill  has  written, 

Resistance  to  immiseration  has  become  far  more  vigorous  in  recent  decades  because  new 
forms  of  communication  have  penetrated  even  remote  villages.  Subsistence  farmers,  who 
in  a  previous  generation  encountered  outsiders  only  rarely  and  as  strangers,  find  a  new 
world  opening  before  them  when  radio  and  TV  programs  begin  to  flood  into  the  village 
square  or  their  homes. .  .Pushed  by  intensifying  land  shortages  at  home  and  pulled  by  the 
charm  of  urban  comforts  as  revealed  by  the  new  communications,  peasant  populations 
are  ready,  as  never  before,  to  claim  the  rights  of  full  citizenship  and  equality  of 
circumstances.  [21,  p.  187] 

These  developments  demand  new  strategies  from  the  United  States. 


239 


THE  UNITED  STATES  AND  STRATEGIC  THINKING 


"Because  it  is  rooted  in  geopolitical  soil,  the  character  of  a  country’s  national  security  policy  tends 
to  show  great  continuity  over  time,  though  there  can  be  cyclical  patterns  of  change. "  [14,  15]  The  United 
States  will  go  to  war  in  2015  for  the  same  reasons  it  has  always  gone  to  war:  threats  to  its  commercial 
interests  and  trading  power  combined  with  its  strong  "moralist"  bent. 

Geopolitics  relates  international  political  power  to  the  geographical  setting.  It  embraces  human 
and  cultural  factors  as  well  as  the  statistics  of  territory,  economic  assets,  and  distances  between  political 
enemies.  "The  cultural  thoughtways  of  a  nation  are  the  product  of  geography."  [14]  To  understand 
American  geopolitical  thinking  requires  an  understanding  of  American  history  and  its  geographical 
perspective. 

United  States  geography  lends  an  insular  perspective  on  international  politics.  The  founding  of 
the  nation  came  about  through  the  desire  to  escape  "Old  World"  entanglements.  The  dread  of  entangling 
alliances  was  a  natural  development  of  that  founding.  The  nation  succeeded  in  pursuing  that  strategy  until 
World  War  I  when  the  balance-of-power  system  in  Europe  broke  down  over  the  inability  to  contain  a 
unified  Germany.  The  exclusively  European  character  of  the  system  was  destroyed  by  the  need  for 
American  assistance:  the  United  States  replaced  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  necessary  balancer. 

At  the  conclusion  of  that  war,  the  United  States  promptly  returned  to  its  historical  isolationist 
position.  Why?  There  are  five  broad  characteristics  of  "the  American  Way": 

1.  The  United  States,  an  insular  power  developed  in  isolation  from  the  quarrels  of  balance-of- 
power  Europe,  harbors  the  belief  that  peace  is  the  normal  and  universally  desired  condition  of  mankind. 
War  is  abnormal  and  preparation  for  war  is  abnormal. 

2.  Americans  have  optimism  about  progress  in  human  affairs  which  is  easily  translated  into 
oscillations  of  mood  between  hope  (based  on  illusion)  and  disenchantment  (attending  disillusion)  when 
confronted  with  the  intractibility  of  international  competition  and  conflict.  Traditionally  Americans  have 
solved  problems,  not  lived  with  them  and  redefined  them  as  conditions. 

3.  Americans  are  prone  to  personalize  international  relations.  Problems  are  deemed  to  be 
solvable  through  person-to-person  meetings. 

4.  Persons  of  goodwill  can  always  reach  agreement  if  they  try  hard  enough.  Americans  view 
compromise  as  the  essence  of  negotiations. 

5.  Order  and  stability  are  values  to  be  promoted  and  defended  internationally.  [14] 

The  American  tradition  is  one  of  moral  ism  and  making  virtue  out  of  the  bequest  of  geographic 
distance  from  the  amoral  squabbles  of  the  Old  World.  Americans  are  conditioned  geopolitically  to  think 
and  feel  in  a  distinctively  American  way:  the  frontier  tradition,  an  experience  and  expectation  of  success 
in  national  endeavors,  an  abundance  of  resources  for  defense,  a  dominant  political  philosophy  of  liberal 
idealism,  and  a  sense  of  separateness  —  moral  and  geostrategic  --  from  evil  doings  of  the  Old  World. 

Since  1945  that  position  has  not  been  tenable:  the  United  States  emerged  from  that  war  as  the 
pre-eminent  power  and  facing  the  rebuilding  of  its  allies  and  containment  of  the  perceived  threat  to  its 


240 


security:  the  Soviet  Union.  The  rebuilding  and  expansion  of  world  markets  and  the  creation  of  an 
environment  for  the  guarantee  of  property  rights  has  brought  about  a  high  level  of  prosperity  for  itself 
and  its  friends  and  allies.  It  is  not  possible  for  the  United  States  to  return  to  an  isolationist  position 
because  its  economy  is  too  dependent  upon  virtually  all  the  other  world  economies. 

There  is  presently  a  revival  of  the  isolationist  vs.  interventionist  debate.  This  debate  will  intensify 
in  the  forecast  period.  In  the  1930s  and  1940s,  this  debate  focused  on  keeping  the  United  States  apart 
from  matters  not  directly  threatening  its  tangible  interests.  Isolationism  is  the  traditional  American 
geopolitical  position.  The  conversion  of  the  isolationists  to  interventionists  was  a  consequence  of  war 
and  anticommunism.  The  neoconservatives  of  today  play  the  part  that  in  the  past  was  played  by  the 
liberal  internationalists  -  the  United  States  crusade  for  global  democracy  (a  la  Wilson).  However,  if  the 
results  of  the  Persian  Gulf  war  are  not  positive,  the  isolationists  would  seem  better  poised  to  dominate 
the  debate  than  at  any  time  since  Pearl  Harbor. 

"Isolationism"  is  an  imprecise  term.  The  United  States  will  not  be  autarkic.  Such  a  position  is 
inconceivable  given  the  reality  of  American  prosperity.  However,  given  the  basic  optimism  of 
Americans,  the  lessening  of  tensions  could  lead  to  a  feeling  of  euphoria  and  desire  to  "come  home  and 
solve  America’s  problems. "  An  accommodation  of  sorts  will  occur.  The  reality  of  the  multi-polar  world 
and  the  recognition  that  other  nations  must  be  responsible  for  sharing  the  security  burden  will  increase 
the  likelihood  that  the  United  States  will  not  pursue  a  "go  it  alone"  policy  and  be  the  global  policeman. 
The  American  electorate  will  not  support  such  a  position  indefinitely.  The  United  States  will  be  active 
in  international  security  affairs,  because  its  interests  are  international  in  scope.  However,  as  a  new 
generation  of  leaders  not  having  experienced  World  War  II  assumes  power,  there  will  be  a  very  real 
likelihood  of  a  reinterpretation  of  America’s  role  in  international  affairs.  Each  generation’s  experience 
colors  its  Weltanschauung. 

What  kind  of  world  will  the  United  States  be  facing  in  2015?  Several  basic  structural  changes 
are  taking  place.  There  is  a  definite  shift  to  the  Pacific  Rim  and  away  from  Europe.  The  Asian-Pacific 
Rim  is  America’s  largest  export  market  —  $21  billion  larger  than  Europe  in  1989.  While  the  EEC  will 
be  a  major  trading  bloc  and  a  primary  partner  both  politically  and  economically,  there  will  not  be  a 
security  threat  to  the  United  States  in  Europe.  The  question  is  what  will  the  EEC  become  as  a  political 
entity?  It  has  no  independent  taxing  authority,  and  all  decisions  must  be  executed  by  the  national 
governments.  To  what  extent  will  the  existence  of  a  single  market  and  common  value-added  tax, 
common  tariffs,  labor  and  security  norms  and  currency  force  parallel  fiscal  and  economic  policies  and 
a  practical  unification  of  national  policy?  For  the  foreseeable  future  there  are  doubts  this  will  occur:  it 
will  likely  be  a  powerful  association  and  will  be  described  like  the  German  principalities  in  the  early  19th 
century:  "impregnable  in  defense  and  incapable  of  aggression."  [24] 

The  potential  for  security  concerns  in  the  Pacific  Rim  area,  on  the  other  hand,  is  high.  North 
Korea  is  on  the  verge  of  becoming  another  Iraq:  the  nuclear  threat  is  great.  Secretary  of  Defense 
Richard  Cheney  has  said  that  North  Korea  is  the  only  place  in  the  world  where  he  fears  an  unprovoked 
nuclear  attack  on  U.S.  forces.  The  Republic  of  Korea  is  not  particularly  stable  to  politically,  and  is 


241 


acquiring  advanced  weapons  technology. 

The  Republic  of  Korea  trades  (through  third  parties)  with  China  to  the  tune  of  $3  billion  per 
annum,  five  times  the  amount  of  trade  China  has  with  North  Korea.  Seoul  has  also  developed  economic 
and  commerical  ties  with  the  Soviet  Union.  The  November  6,  1990  edition  of  The  Wall  Street  Journal 
reported  direct  telephone  links  between  Moscow  and  Seoul,  with  5,000  calls  per  month.  The  Republic 
of  Korea  also  has  guaranteed  the  Soviet  Union  $2.3  billion  in  loans. 

A  line  of  "economic  force"  stretches  from  Japan  to  Australia,  but  will  that  economic  power  also 
become  political  power?  Is  political  power  possible  without  military  power?  The  refusal  of  Japan  to 
become  actively  involved  in  Operation  Desert  Storm  has  raised  questions  about  the  "commitment"  of  the 
Japanese  to  the  Western  Alliance.  Yet,  Japan  has  been  quite  willing  to  use  economic  muscle  on  the 
political  issue  of  the  Northern  Territories  dispute  with  the  Soviet  Union. 

Japan  has  an  aging  population:  over  20%  of  the  population  is  over  the  age  of  65.  The  aging 
phenomenon  will  not  change  in  the  forecast  period.  It  is  unlikely  that  Japan  will  risk  its  homogeneity 
and  allow  any  immigration  which  could  alter  its  demographic  trend.  Can  an  "aged"  population  develop 
into  a  military  threat?  With  the  passing  of  the  World-War-II  generation  from  the  scene,  will  the  new 
generation  of  Japanese  leaders  be  hesitant  to  develop  the  nation’s  military  potential?  What  kinds  of 
threats  would  Japanese  leaders  consider  sufficient  to  develop  a  capability  beyond  its  defense  forces? 

Japan  is  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  international  trading  economy  and  trade  discrimination  or 
a  trade  war.  Currently  lacking  the  ambition  for  a  global  role,  Japan  is  probably  disqualified  for  it  by  its 
historic  isolation.  Resentments  in  Asia  from  World  War  II  and  current  trading  practices,  which  many 
Pacific  Rim  nations  consider  discriminatory,  are  obstacles  to  a  world  political  role  commensurate  with 
its  economic  strength.  But,  the  relative  military  weakness  of  Japan  and  the  countries  of  Europe  is 
reversible:  all  have  been  military  powers  in  the  past.  Increasing  Japanese  rearmament  is  within  the  realm 
of  the  possible. 

As  noted  above,  China  will  eventually  undergo  military  modernization.  China  is  an  enormous 
country  in  both  territory  and  population,  leading  many  to  question  whether  a  country  of  that  size  can  be 
governed  because  of  regional  disparity  (the  coastal  delta  with  the  overwhelming  majority  of  the  population 
is  contrasted  with  the  arid  center). 

Other  countries  of  the  region  pose  similar  questions.  Indonesia,  for  example,  is  politically 
unstable.  Because  of  the  enormous  volume  of  trade  conducted  with  this  region,  the  United  States  has 
vital  strategic  interests  in  the  political  events  in  the  Pacific  Rim.  It  is  conceivable  that  any  or  all  of  these 
countries  could  eventually  be  perceived  as  a  security  threat.  How  reliable  an  ally  is  Japan?  When  a 
peace  treaty  ending  World  War  II  eventually  is  signed  between  Japan  and  the  Soviet  Union,  how  closely 
will  the  two  nations  interact?  How  trustworthy  is  the  Republic  of  Korea?  Indonesia  is  the  world’s  largest 
Moslem  nation.  What  if  a  fundamentalist  revolution  occurs  there  comparable  to  that  in  Iran?  What  role 
would  the  United  States  play  in  a  war  between  two  of  its  allies?  Would  it  need  to  remain  neutral?  Would 
it  be  able  to  remain  neutral?  Must  the  United  States  consider  all  these  nations  potential  security  threats? 

In  the  forecast  period,  the  United  States  will  be  reduced  as  the  focus  of  power  for  several  reasons: 


242 


1)  the  reduction  in  great  power  confrontation  (the  end  of  the  Cold  War)  will  mean  that  the  United  States 
will  no  longer  necessarily  be  seen  as  the  "decisive  leader";  2)  the  rise  of  Japan  as  an  economic  power, 
particularly  in  high  technology,  means  that  much  of  the  focus  of  technology  will  shift  there;  3)  social 
problems  at  home  (drugs,  crime,  aging  of  the  infrastructure,  a  general  perception  of  a  declining  quality 
of  life)  will  require  attention  to  be  diverted  to  the  domestic  agenda;  and  4)  the  low  investment  rate  and 
productivity  of  the  American  economy  will  mean  that  it  cannot  be  the  driving  engine  of  the  world  market. 
Make  no  mistake,  it  will  still  be  vitally  important,  but  not  the  engine.  There  will  be  many  engines.  [5] 

Other  geopolitical  factors  to  be  considered  are  demographic  change  and  the  tension  between 
global  economic  interaction  and  national  politics.  The  aging  of  the  developed  world  is  a  fact: 
populations  there  are  not  reproducing  themselves.  The  developing  world  presents  the  opposite  picture: 
it  is  growing  at  an  astonishing  rate.  Mexico  is  a  clear  case:  40  percent  of  its  population  is  between  the 
ages  of  14  and  25.  It  is  typical  of  the  "South".  The  aggregate  population  growth  rates  will  probably 
result  in  per  capita  GNP  that  stagnates  or  declines  in  Mexico,  Argentina,  and  Egypt.  High  unemployment 
(over  40  percent  has  been  suggested)  may  pose  risks  to  political  and  social  stability  in  these  countries  and 
adjacent  regions.  Tensions,  instability,  and  in  some  cases  conflict  may  arise  as  a  result.  The  intensive 
immigration  to  more  developed  states  from  Latin  America  and  Asia  to  North  America,  and  the  Middle 
East  and  Africa  to  Europe  has  been  occurring  at  a  steady  rate.  Social  and  political  tension  in  Europe  can 
be  seen  today  and  will  intensify  in  the  forecast  period.  Immigration  has  caused  a  marked  change  in  the 
social  texture  and  cultural  patterns  of  the  United  States.  This  massive  immigration  will  influence  future 
cohesion  and  the  political  capacities  of  Western  industrial  nations.  [24] 

While  the  economies  of  the  world  are  becoming  increasingly  interdependent  and  economic 
transactions  span  the  globe  on  a  twenty-four-hour  basis,  each  nation-state  has  its  own  national  priorities 
and  constituencies.  There  is  a  global  capital  shortage,  and  the  U.S.  economy  has  lost  its  attraction  for 
capital  --  more  money  has  been  going  out  than  coming  in  and  this  trend  could  be  long-term.  Japan’s 
economy  is  growing  faster  than  that  of  the  United  States  and  the  European  Community  is  a  capital 
sponge:  the  unification  into  a  single  market  has  kept  money  home  for  investment.  The  leverage  imposed 
by  the  United  States  on  Japan  in  the  past  (the  threat  of  closing  U.S.  markets  or  removing  the  security 
umbrella  rings  hollow  today)  is  no  more.  The  likelihood  of  tension  between  global  economic  activity  and 
national  politics  is  real.  It  is  likely  that  the  United  States  will  aggressively  pursue  its  economic  goals  and 
no  longer  subordinate  them  to  its  security  interests.  It  will  require  much  patience  and  perserverence  on 
the  part  of  free-traders  to  maintain  the  world  markets  and  defuse  tensions.  The  emergence  of  European, 
East  Asian,  and  North  American  trading  blocs  may  foster  regional  security  perspectives--a  world  with 
three  roughly  equal  economic  powers  may  have  no  country  willing  to  take  the  responsibility  for  collective 
security. 

It  is  unlikely  that  there  will  be  a  systems  change  in  international  organization.  The  reasons  for 
the  rise  of  the  nation-state  in  the  17th  century  have  not  changed  substantially.  In  spite  of  the  persuasive 
arguments  put  forth  by  the  "interdependence"  analysts,  there  are  flaws  in  their  arguments.  The  rules  for 
the  open  international  economic  system  precede,  rather  than  follow,  technological  change:  the 


243 


telecommunications  revolution  has  fostered  interdependence  of  the  world’s  economies,  but  the  markets 
have  been  able  to  develop  within  a  broader  institutional  structure  delineated  by  the  power  and  policies 
of  the  state.  Ultimately,  the  survival  of  states  is  enhanced  by  the  growing  significance  of  juridical 
sovereignty:  the  fact  that  they  are  recognized  as  sovereign  by  other  states  in  the  international  system. 
Evidence  for  this  can  be  seen  in  the  drive  by  nation-states  to  protect  the  sovereignty  of  a  state  invaded 
by  a  neighbor  (Kuwait)  but  not  "interfere  in  the  internal  affairs"  of  another  state  during  a  popular  uprising 
(civil  war  in  Iraq). 


CONCLUSION 

In  the  year  2015  the  world  will  be  multi-polar  with  different  blocs  of  powers  vying  for  resources 
and  economic  supremacy.  The  United  States  will  still  be  powerful,  but  will  not  be  driving  the  world’s 
economic  engine.  The  United  States  will  work  in  concert  with  other  trading  blocs:  Europe,  East  Asia, 
and  the  Western  Hemisphere.  There  will  be  nation-states  in  other  regions  that  will  be  more  powerful  than 
their  neighbors  and  the  conflicts  that  arise  will  require  concerted,  coalition  action  by  other  nation-states. 

Threats  to  security  will  come  in  the  form  of  regional  conflicts  between  smaller  states  and  groups 
within  states  vying  for  power.  The  "misery  index"  of  the  "South"  will  need  to  be  reduced  or  the 
developed  world  will  face  serious  terrorist  threats  and  regional  wars.  The  fissure  between  rich  and  poor 
nations  will  be  a  test  for  the  developed  world.  Few  people  see  poverty  as  the  will  of  God.  The  global 
telecommunications  network  has  revealed  that  poverty  is  the  result  of  human  decisions.  Overcoming  the 
poverty  gap  will  be  the  most  powerful  political  force  of  the  age.  [10]  As  we  noted  above,  as  tribal  and 
national  groups  attempt  to  unite  with  their  own  kind,  they  will  lunge  for  tribal  turf  and  national 
sovereignty.  The  power  of  charismatic  leaders-Caesars-will  be  a  warning  signal  of  potential  difficulty. 
Political  conflicts  will  arise  from  religious  differences,  racial  or  tribal  collisions,  language  conflicts,  or 
historical  antagonisms.  These  could  develop  into  "we"  and  "they"  confrontations  on  a  global  scale. 
These  groups  will  need  to  rediscover  and  reassert  pride  in  their  past  as  a  measure  of  self-esteem.  If  the 
United  States  can  assist  them  in  that  effort,  then  potentially  lethal  conflicts  can  be  averted. 

The  United  States  will  need  to  have  highly  mobile  armed  forces,  well-equipped  with  high- 
technology  weaponry  and  highly  skilled  personnel  to  operate  it.  The  forces  will  need  to  have  theater- 
specific  capabilities  and  be  able  to  respond  quickly  to  perceived  threats  to  American  interests.  Those 
interests  will  be  primarily  economic  in  nature:  threats  to  markets  and  natural  resources.

CONCLUSION 


Two  powerful  forces— demography  and  technology-are  driving  the  trends  identified  in  this  study. 
These  two  forces  affect  all  aspects  of  the  domestic  scene  and  have  international  impact  as  well. 
Technological  developments  have  transformed  the  industrial  order  and  brought  about  the  post-industrial 
society,  the  microelectronic  revolution,  the  information  age-whatever  one  may  choose  to  call  this  era. 
These  developments  have  generated  domestic  and  global  turbulence  fed  by  broad  changes  in  the  size  and 
structure  of  populations,  the  distribution  of  natural  resources,  particularly  those  relating  to  the  generation 
of  energy,  and  the  results  of  technology  in  all  fields. 

In  the  domestic  arena,  the  population  trends  indicate  that  the  United  States  is  an  aging  society. 
While  acknowledging  that  demographic  projections  are  not  always  reliable  (human  reproductive  behavior 
is  especially  volatile),  the  trends  have  been  very  powerful:  there  is  unprecedented  decline  in  fertility  rates 
and  an  accompanying  explosion  in  longevity.  Projections  suggest  that  the  fertility  rate  of  the  United 
States  will  fall  gradually  to  about  1.65  by  the  year  2015  (a  number  that  is  considerably  below  the  2.2 
figure  considered  replacement  level),  while  in  the  same  period,  life  expectancy  will  rise  to  almost  85 
years.  Barring  a  major  shift  in  individual  behavior,  that  trend  is  very  likely  to  remain  unchanged. 

What  do  these  demographic  trends  portend  for  the  United  States  in  2015?  Health  care  costs  will 
take  increasingly  large  portions  of  federal,  state,  and  local  budgets  because  older  people  require  more 
attention.  Total  health-care  spending  is  currently  about  11  percent  of  GNP  and  is  projected  to  be  17 
percent  by  2015.  A  higher  number  of  workers  will  retire  from  the  labor  force  than  enter  it;  fewer 
workers  will  be  producing  for  more  retirees.  A  pattern  of  generational  and  ethnic  conflicts  could  emerge 
from  this  condition.  The  issues:  will  increased  burdens  be  borne  by  workers  or  retirees  benefits  be 
reduced,  and  will  the  majority  of  taxpayers~who  will  be  nonwhite-continue  to  support  non-Hispanic 
white  retirees? 

Because  the  work  force  will  have  fewer  members  yet  increasing  demands  (to  compete 
internationally  in  order  to  maintain  prosperity,  to  support  retirees,  to  build  for  their  own  and  their 
families’  futures),  efficiency  will  be  the  driver  of  the  economy.  In  a  shrinking  manufacturing  sector, 
more  robots  will  perform  those  tasks  requiring  intensive  labor.  The  service  sector  will  expand,  both 
because  of  the  transition  to  a  post-industrial  economy  where  the  service  sector  is  naturally  larger  and  to 
meet  the  increasing  services  required  by  the  aging  population. 

Because  fewer  new  workers  will  be  entering  the  labor  market,  the  United  States  will  need  to 
ensure  that  every  member  of  society  is  productive.  Society  will  not  be  able  to  afford  any  "forgotten 
members."  Educational  excellence  will  also  be  driven  by  the  need  to  remain  competitive  in  the 
international  arena.  Parents  and  educators  alike  must  expect  better  quality  and  demand  higher 
achievement  of  each  child  exiting  the  education  system. 

The  U.S.  Army  will  have  a  smaller  manpower  pool  from  which  to  select  its  members.  Weaponry 
will  become  increasingly  complicated  and  "smart"  because  of  technological  advances,  and  operators  will 


247 


need  to  be  better  qualified.  Even  with  advances  in  modular  assembly,  the  army  will  need  to  rely  on 
personnel  who  are  highly  skilled,  cognitive-capable  problem-solvers.  One  certainty  is  that  individual 
initiative  and  creativity  will  be  ever  more  critical  to  success. 

Technology  and  resources  will  also  be  driven  by  the  aging  population:  there  will  be  incentives 
for  "wonder  drugs"  and  bioengineering  breakthroughs.  The  U.S.  Army  will  be  forced  to  rely  on 
increasingly  complex  sensor  technology  because  more  functions  will  be  performed  by  fewer  personnel. 

Regionally,  the  changes  in  population  will  bring  pressure  to  bear  on  natural  resource  availability 
and  distribution.  Water,  for  example,  may  determine  how  much  population  and  agriculture  the  West  and 
Southwest  can  support. 

The  demographic  trend  indicates  that  the  ethnic  composition  of  the  United  States  is  changing. 
Americans  of  European  descent  are  not  replacing  themselves  in  sufficient  numbers  to  maintain  the 
historical  majority  in  the  population.  Hispanic-,  Asian-,  and  Black-Americans  are  increasing  at  a  faster 
rate  than  non-Hispanic-white  Americans.  Maintaining  basic  consensus  necessary  for  effective  public 
action  becomes  more  difficult  when  a  society  divides  into  distinct  and  separate  ethnic  and  cultural  blocs. 
The  fundamental  question  arising  from  this  trend  is  whether  the  dominant  feature  of  American  society 
will  continue  to  be  "pluralistic."  Will  immigrants  assimilate  to  the  point  where  they  have  a  strong  sense 
of  "American-ness"  or  will  they  cling  to  ethnic  and  racial  categories  ranging  from  " Asian-American, " 
"African-American,"  "Hispanic-American,"  to  "Salvadoran-American,"  "Vietnamese- American,", 
"Nigerian-American,"  ad  infinitum  at  the  expense  of  being  "American?"  The  answer  depends  on  whether 
the  immigrant  populations  refuse  or  are  not  allowed  to  assimilate  to  the  national  norm.  These  are  public 
policy  decisions.  The  results  of  those  decisions  will  influence  the  nature  of  the  Army  in  2015.  No 
serious  problem  is  foreseen  because  the  Army  is  one  institution  that  has  been  more  successful  than  others 
in  dealing  with  ethnic  diversity. 

Internationally  the  "graying  of  the  North"  is  driving  trends  as  well.  Like  the  United  States,  the 
population  of  the  developed  world,  "the  North,"  is  growing  at  a  slower  pace.  Many  nations  of  Europe 
have  fertility  rates  lower  than  that  of  the  United  States,  and  the  projection  is  that  the  trend  will  persist. 
At  the  same  time,  the  "South,"  the  developing  or  Third  World,  is  young  and  rapidly  reproducing  itself. 
Global  projections  predict  a  population  of  seven  billion  by  2010;  84.1  percent  of  that  population  will 
reside  in  less  developed  countries  by  2025.  These  are  sobering  statistics  with  important  geopolitical 
ramifications. 

First,  given  the  aging  of  the  "North,"  some  analysts  suggest  that  the  central  challenge  to  the 
survival  of  democracy,  freedom,  and  capitalism  is  demographic  decline:  there  will  be  fewer  free 
Westerners  around  to  protect  and  promote  these  values.  If  the  current  movement  toward  multiparty 
democracy  in  Africa  and  Latin  America  does  not  succeed,  the  "North"  will  risk  being  outnumbered. 

Second,  the  intensive  migration  from  the  "South"  to  the  "North"  will  exacerbate  social  and 
cultural  tensions,  creating  conflicts.  The  nature  of  such  conflict  is  usually  expressed  in  terms  of  the 
"push/pull"  model:  the  economic  deprivation,  unemployment,  and  high  fertility  (push)  of  developing 
countries  work  in  tandem  with  the  possibility  for  family  reunification,  higher  wages,  and  the  demand  for 


248 


employment  (pull)  in  industrialized  countries.  Another  factor  on  the  "push"  side  of  the  model  that  has 
recently  become  prominent  is  environmental  degradation.  The  Haitian  "boat  people"  fled  poverty  caused, 
among  other  things,  by  soil  erosion  and  deforestation.  The  environmental  consequences  of  resource 
destruction  brought  about  by  population  growth  and  industrialization  is  a  worldwide  phenomenon.  In  the 
forecast  period,  economic,  political,  and  ecological  pressures  may  trigger  significant  waves  of  refugees 
to  the  developed  world. 

The  influx  of  immigrants  will  aggravate  differences  between  peoples,  causing  social  tensions. 
Natives  will  fear  a  change  in  the  political  and  social  complexion  of  the  country,  a  " minor itization"  or 
cultural  pollution.  The  potential  for  conflicts  will  increase. 

Third,  in  periods  of  turbulence,  people  tend  to  grasp  "eternal"  values  such  as  ethnic  unity 
(tribalism),  social  cohesion,  religious  beliefs  and  practices,  and  national  sameness  to  maintain  their  sense 
of  identity.  The  possible  struggles  arising  from  clashes  between  value  systems  may  be  a  prominent 
feature  of  the  next  century. 

The  "South"  will  not  be  forever  young,  however.  With  development  comes  the  eventual 
possibility  that  changes  in  individual  behavior  will  occur  and  the  demographic  trend  will  be  altered.  This 
trend  alteration  is  not  foreseen  in  the  forecast  period. 

The  second  structural  force  driving  domestic  trends  is  technology.  This  force  drives  the 
demographic  parameter  through  medical  developments  in  family  planning  and  life  extension.  More 
women  have  entered  the  work  force  and  professions  once  the  exclusive  domain  of  males.  This  trend  will 
continue  because  the  declining  fertility  rate  will  dictate  that  the  United  States  will  need  the  talents  of  every 
member  of  society.  Technological  advances  in  medicine  may  permit  older  people  to  retain  their 
capabilities  and  be  economically  productive  longer.  Bioethical  questions  will  accompany  birth  control, 
abortion,  and  family  planning  developments  and  will  continue  to  be  divisive  social  issues. 

Technological  developments  bring  to  light  new  fabrication  procedures  and  new  materials  requiring 
raw  ingredients  that  the  United  States  has  in  very  limited  supply  or  not  at  all.  Reliable  suppliers  will  be 
mandatory  for  U.S.  security.  This  trend  will  be  likely  to  intensify.  How  and  from  which  sources  the 
United  States  meets  its  needs  for  resources,  particularly  mineral  fuels,  will  be  a  major  challenge. 

Technology  is  of  fundamental  importance  to  the  economy  because  it  is  driving  global 
interdependence  through  telecommunications  and  data  transfer:  financial  and  business  transactions  are 
conducted  on  a  24-hour  basis.  Global  interdependence,  however,  may  lead  to  attempts  by  national 
governments  to  impose  more  controls  on  domestic  populations.  Shrinking  economic,  social,  and  political 
distances  have  transnational ized  global  affairs  and  increased  vulnerability  of  domestic  economies  to 
external  influences.  National  governments,  for  example,  will  intervene  in  the  internal  flow  of  goods  and 
services  in  order  to  cope  with  internationalization  of  market  and  banking  systems.  Technology  will  shape 
the  work  place  in  increasing  ways,  from  information  processing  and  computer-aided  design  to  robotics. 
Electronics  manufacturing  will  replace  steel  as  the  principal  measure  of  an  economy’s  industrial  output 
because  it  will  be  the  essential  component  in  much  that  is  produced.  Operation  "Desert  Storm" 
demonstrated  that  the  manufacture  of  electronic  components  is  already  a  strategic  resource. 


249 


Technology  is  an  important  driver  of  education  reform  and  will  be  the  principal  factor  in  the 
development  of  distance  learning  that  links  remote  "learning  centers."  The  use  of  technology  in 
education  will  go  beyond  the  imitation  of  television  into  interactive  learning.  The  army  will  need  to  take 
more  responsibility  for  the  remedial  education  of  recruits.  It  will  be  forced  into  making  even  greater 
strides  in  the  development  of  education  technology  and  its  application. 

Technology  transfer  to  other  nations  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  a  national  security  concern. 
Because  of  the  increasing  frequency  of  co-production  schemes  and  movement  of  scientific  research 
worldwide,  this  concern  will  only  intensify.  The  spread  of  advanced  technology  to  Third  World  countries 
will  increase  the  danger  of  more  deadly  conflicts  in  areas  remote  to  the  United  States.  The  Army  will 
need  to  rely  on  specialized  operations  units  that  will  be  readily  deployable  and  have  theater-specific 
capabilities. 

In  consideration  of  any  global  view  of  the  future,  it  is  important  to  take  stock  of  any  change  in 
the  basics  of  the  human  condition,  the  philosophical  underpinnings  (teleology,  ontology,  and 
epistemology-questions  specifically  raised  by  the  sponsor).  Has  there  been  or  is  there  likely  to  be  any 
change  in  our  basic  relation  to  the  universe? 

The  short  answer  is  simply  no.  Despite  the  incredible  progress  in  science  and  technology  during 
the  past  few  centuries,  and  particularly  the  past  few  decades,  the  basic  human  condition  remains  the  same. 
The  individual,  his  knowledge  of  the  universe  being  mediated  by  his  limited  senses,  is  born  and  dies, 
relying  on  faith  to  provide  value  to  his  own  life  and  that  of  the  universe.  Whether  there  is  an  aim, 
purpose,  and  direction  to  life  is  still  a  judgement  to  be  made  by  every  individual.  Social  progress  in  the 
sense  of  people  being  able  to  live  together  in  harmony  has  not  changed  throughout  recorded  history;  there 
have  always  been  oases  of  sanity,  harmony,  and  riches  surrounded  by  incredible  misery  and  senseless 
cruelty.  The  20th  century  has  seen  the  likes  of  Hitler,  Stalin,  Idi  Amin,  and  Saddam  Hussein,  and  one 
can  argue  that  the  amount  of  human  carnage  has  not  decreased,  nor  even  its  percentage,  despite  our 
"enlightenment."  In  terms  of  human  rational  faculties,  despite  their  "extension"  by  infrared  vision 
systems,  telescopes,  microscopes,  and  readouts  from  physical  instruments,  the  basic  sources  of  knowledge 
remain  as  they  have  been  since  Socrates.  Although  humans  have  been  quite  adept  at  using  deductive 
knowledge,  even  incorporating  that  process  in  "intelligent  computers"  as  servants  and  mind  amplifiers, 
humans  know  no  more  of  the  sources  of  creativity  and  of  inductive  reasoning  than  they  did  during  the 
time  of  the  ancient  Greek  civilization. 

There  is,  however,  more  grist  for  the  mill,  and  there  is  some  reason  to  hope  for  some  long-range 
qualitative  changes  in  the  understanding  of  ourselves  and  the  universe.  While  epistemology  remains 
unchanged,  its  subject,  knowledge,  has  not  only  grown  by  leaps  and  bounds  undreamed  by  our  ancestors, 
but  has  also  given  us  tools  for  its  organization  and  its  rapid  further  expansion  in  computers  and  scientific 
research  enterprises.  The  tools  have  grown  to  the  point  where  they  reach  beyond  the  planet,  allowing 
humans  to  orbit  the  Earth  and  land  on  the  Moon,  and  to  send  probes  beyond  the  solar  system  itself. 

Personal  powers,  as  far  as  ontology  is  concerned,  have  also  been  extended  beyond  the  ancients’ 
dreams.  Humans  routinely  zoom  around  highways  far  beyond  what  organismic  powers  would  allow,  and 


250 


possess  the  ability  to  fly  at  supersonic  speeds,  to  speak  instantly  to  almost  anyone  on  the  planet  by 
telephone,  and  to  access  an  incredible  wealth  of  human  knowledge. 

With  regard  to  teleology,  where  are  we  going,  and  is  there  purpose  to  it?  What  purpose  is  there 
in  the  birth  of  a  baby?  It  is  clear  from  the  fact  that  we  are  undergoing  rapid  change  that  humanity  is  still, 
in  fact,  in  its  infancy,  and  that  this  is  a  time  of  hope,  with  the  promise  of  future  development  of  a  sane 
society  of  incredibly  powerful  and  wise  individuals.  The  time  scope  for  fulfillment  of  this  potential 
promise  is,  alas,  way  beyond  the  year  2015.
