Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared 
by  the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress 
under  the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program  spon- 
sored by  the  Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  two  pages  of  this 
book  list  the  other  published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  coun- 
try, describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and 
national  security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the 
interrelationships  of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are 
shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  factors.  Each  study  is  written 
by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists.  The  authors 
seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  society, 
striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular 
attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society, 
their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  common  inter- 
ests and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature  and 
extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should 
not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States 
government  position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have 
sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity. 
Corrections,  additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  read- 
ers will  be  welcomed  for  use  in  future  editions.

Preface 


At  the  end  of  1991,  the  formal  dissolution  of  the  Soviet 
Union  was  the  surprisingly  swift  result  of  decrepitude  within 
that  empire.  The  Russian  Federation  was  one  of  the  fifteen 
"new"  nations  that  emerged  from  that  process;  in  this  form, 
Russians  retained  much  of  the  domination  over  nearby  minor- 
ity groups  that  they  had  exercised  in  the  days  of  the  Russian 
Empire  and  the  Soviet  Union.  But  the  major  changes  that  have 
occurred  since  1991  fully  justify  the  new  subseries  of  Country 
Studies  describing  all  fifteen  of  the  former  Soviet  republics  in 
their  past  and  present  circumstances.  The  present  volume  is 
the  fifth  in  the  six-volume  series,  which  is  the  successor  to  the 
one-volume  Soviet  Union:  A  Country  Study,  published  in  1991. 

The  marked  relaxation  of  Soviet-era  information  restric- 
tions, which  began  in  Russia  in  the  late  1980s  and  accelerated 
after  1991,  allows  the  presentation  of  reliable,  complete  infor- 
mation on  most  aspects  of  life  in  the  Russian  Federation — 
including  many  of  the  negative  aspects  such  as  corruption, 
environmental  degradation,  and  deterioration  of  the  military 
that  were  reported  only  incompletely  in  earlier  volumes.  Schol- 
arly articles  and  periodical  reports  have  been  especially  helpful 
in  accounting  for  the  years  of  independence  in  the  1990s  and 
in  evaluating  the  earlier  times  that  form  the  backdrop  for  the 
most  recent  period.  The  authors  have  described  the  historical, 
political,  economic,  and  social  background  of  Russia  as  the 
context  for  their  current  portraits.  In  each  case,  the  author's 
goal  was  to  provide  a  compact,  accessible,  and  objective  treat- 
ment of  five  main  topics:  historical  background,  the  society  and 
its  environment,  the  economy,  government  and  politics,  and 
national  security.  Military  insignia,  a  standard  feature  of  the 
Country  Studies  series,  have  not  been  included  in  this  volume 
because,  at  the  time  of  preparation,  the  Ministry  of  Defense  of 
the  Russian  Federation  was  in  the  process  of  changing  insigina, 
and  budget  shortages  delayed  its  publication  of  a  comprehen- 
sive chart.  Brief  comments  on  some  of  the  more  useful,  readily 
accessible  sources  used  in  preparing  this  volume  appear  at  the 
end  of  each  chapter.  Full  references  to  these  and  other  sources 
used  by  the  authors  are  listed  in  the  Bibliography. 

In  most  cases,  personal  names  have  been  transliterated  from 
Russian  according  to  the  system  approved  by  the  United  States 


xix 


Board  on  Geographic  Names  (BGN).  In  the  case  of  widely 
known  individuals  whose  names  appear  frequently  in  Latin 
alphabets,  such  as  Joseph  V.  Stalin  and  Boris  N.  Yeltsin,  the 
widely  used  conventional  form  of  the  name  has  been  chosen. 
Geographical  names  are  treated  in  the  same  way:  places  such  as 
Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  and  geographical  names  such  as 
Siberia  and  Lake  Baikal  are  rendered  in  conventional  form, 
but  all  other  geographical  names  appear  in  the  transliteration 
of  the  BGN  system.  Some  Soviet-era  place-names  such  as  the 
cities  of  Gor'kiy  and  Sverdlovsk  have  been  changed  in  the 
1990s  (to  Nizhniy  Novgorod  and  Yekaterinburg,  respectively,  in 
the  case  of  these  two  examples),  and  the  newest  forms  are  used 
in  this  book. 

Organizations  commonly  known  by  their  acronyms  (such  as 
IMF — the  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  KGB — the  Com- 
mittee for  State  Security)  are  introduced  in  full  form,  supple- 
mented with  the  vernacular  form  where  appropriate. 
Autonomous  republics  such  as  the  Republic  of  Chechnya  are 
introduced  in  full  form  in  the  detailed  description  of  those 
regions  in  Chapter  4,  but  short  forms  (in  the  case  of  this  exam- 
ple, Chechnya)  are  used  elsewhere. 

Measurements  are  given  in  the  metric  system;  a  conversion 
table  is  provided  in  the  Appendix.  The  Chronology  at  the 
beginning  of  the  book  lists  major  historical  events  in  Russia 
from  the  founding  of  Kievan  Rus'  to  the  significant  events  of 
the  first  nine  months  of  1997.  To  amplify  points  in  the  chap- 
ters, tables  in  the  Appendix  provide  statistics  on  the  environ- 
ment, the  population,  economic  conditions,  political  events, 
and  the  military  establishment. 

The  body  of  the  text  reflects  information  available  as  of  July 
31,  1996.  Certain  other  portions  of  the  text,  however,  have 
been  updated.  The  Introduction  and  Chronology  include 
events  and  trends  that  have  occurred  since  the  completion  of 
research,  the  Country  Profile  includes  updated  information  as 
available,  the  Bibliography  lists  recently  published  sources 
thought  to  be  particularly  helpful  to  the  reader,  and  Table  23 
includes  newly  available  statistics.

xliii 


border.  Arctic,  Atlantic,  and  Pacific  oceans  touch  shores. 

Land  Use:  10  percent  arable,  45  percent  forest,  5  percent 
meadows  and  pasture,  and  40  percent  other,  including  tundra. 

Society 

Population:  According  to  United  States  government  estimates, 
149,909,089.  According  to  official  1996  Russian  statistics, 
148,200,000. 

Ethnic  Groups:  According  to  1989  census,  Russian  81.5 
percent,  Tatar  3.8  percent,  Ukrainian  3.0  percent,  Chuvash  1.2 
percent,  Bashkir  0.9  percent,  Belorussian  0.8  percent, 
Mordovian  0.7  percent,  and  other  8.1  percent. 

Languages:  Official  language  Russian.  Approximately  100 
others  spoken. 

Religion:  In  1996  about  75  percent  of  believers  in  Russia 
considered  themselves  Russian  Orthodox,  19  percent  Muslim, 
and  7  percent  other.  Religious  activity  increased  sharply  in 
post-Soviet  period,  given  official  government  and 
constitutional  sanction. 

Education:  About  98  percent  of  population  over  age  fifteen 
literate.  Constitution  guarantees  right  to  free  preschool,  basic 
general,  and  secondary  vocational  education.  Basic  general 
education  compulsory  until  age  fifteen.  In  1995  about  500 
postsecondary  schools  in  operation,  including  forty-two 
universities.  Postsecondary  technical  and  vocational  schools 
now  offer  comprehensive  education.  Private  schools  and 
universities  emerging  in  mid-1990s. 

Health:  Health  care  free  of  charge  in  principle,  but  adequate 
treatment  increasingly  depends  upon  wealth.  Doctors  poorly 
paid  and  poorly  trained,  and  hospitals  decrepit.  Shortages  of 
nurses,  specialized  personnel,  and  medical  supplies  and 
equipment  persist.  National  distribution  of  facilities  and 
medical  personnel  highly  skewed  in  favor  of  urban  areas, 
especially  politically  sensitive  cities.  About  131  hospital  beds 
per  10,000  population  and  one  doctor  for  every  275  citizens. 
1994  life  expectancy  57.3  years  for  males,  71.1  years  for 
females,  having  dropped  sharply  since  1990.  Officially  reported 
infant  mortality  rate  19.9  per  1,000  live  births  in  1994.  Poor 
quality  of  water  and  air  in  many  areas  and  excessive  smoking 


xliv 


and  alcohol  use  exacerbate  poor  health  of  nation. 

Labor  Force:  About  57  percent  of  population  working  age. 
Work  force  relatively  well-educated  but  ill-suited  for  challenges 
of  post-Soviet  economy.  In  1994  some  37  percent  of  labor  force 
worked  in  services,  27.7  percent  in  industry,  14.9  percent  in 
agriculture,  10.9  percent  in  construction,  and  7.6  percent  in 
transport  and  communications.  More  than  16  percent  of  labor 
force  works  for  government. 

Economy 

Salient  Features:  After  years  of  double-digit  declines,  gross 
domestic  product  (GDP)  shrank  by  only  4  percent  in  1995. 
GDP  per  capita  in  1995  US$4,224.  Unemployment  rising 
steadily,  to  estimated  8.5  percent  in  1996;  official  Russian 
numbers  about  half  that  amount.  Inflation,  very  high  in  1994, 
under  much  better  control  under  new  government  policy  in 
1995-96;  April  1997  rate  1.2  percent.  Economy  increasingly 
dependent  on  foreign  investment,  multilateral  loan  agencies, 
and  rescheduling  of  foreign  debt.  Privatization  nearly 
complete  but  meeting  political  opposition  to  transformation  of 
large  state  firms.  Most  prices  determined  by  market.  Role  of 
organized  crime  significant,  and  much  economic  activity 
officially  unaccounted  for. 

Agriculture:  6.3  percent  of  GDP  in  1994.  Major  products  grain, 
sugar  beets,  sunflower  seeds,  vegetables,  fruits,  meat,  and  milk. 

Manufacturing:  28.3  percent  of  GDP  in  1994.  Principal 
products  machine  tools,  rolling  mills,  high-performance 
aircraft,  space  vehicles,  ships,  road  and  rail  transportation 
equipment,  communications  equipment,  agricultural 
machinery,  tractors  and  construction  equipment,  electric- 
power  generating  and  transmitting  equipment,  medical  and 
scientific  instruments,  and  consumer  durables. 

Services:  50  percent  of  GDP  in  1994.  Tourism  important 
source  of  foreign  currency.  Expansion  of  financial, 
communications,  and  information  enterprises  contributes  to 
growth.  Shipping  services  also  major  foreign-exchange  earner. 

Mining:  Considerable  mineral  wealth,  especially  iron  ore, 
copper,  phosphates,  manganese,  chromium,  nickel,  platinum, 
diamonds,  and  gold.  Production  declined  steadily  1990-95. 

Energy:  Russia  self-sufficient  in  fuels  and  energy  production. 


xlv 


Natural  gas  and  oil  main  fuels  exploited,  coal  production 
declining  but  still  significant;  long-distance  fuel  transportation 
a  significant  problem.  Main  electricity  sources:  coal  18  percent, 
nuclear  13  percent,  hydroelectric  19  percent,  and  natural  gas 
42  percent.  Industry  consumes  61  percent  of  energy 
production.  Generation  capacity  188  gigawatts.  Energy  exports 
most  important  source  of  foreign  exchange. 

Foreign  Trade:  Trade  liberalization  ongoing,  abolishing  export 
duties,  restructuring  import  tariffs,  and  ending  export 
registration  in  1996.  Main  trading  partners  Germany,  Italy,  the 
Netherlands,  Switzerland,  Britain,  the  United  States,  Ukraine, 
Kazakstan,  Belarus,  China,  and  Japan.  Exports  for  1995 
estimated  at  US$77.8  billion,  imports  US$57.9  billion.  Balance 
of  payments  US$13.1  billion  in  1995.  Capital  flight  expected  to 
drop  to  US$1  billion  in  1996.  Foreign  investment  strongly 
encouraged  in  some  sectors,  but  unpredictable  commercial 
conditions  hinder  growth.  Outstanding  Soviet-era  debt  by 
Third  World  countries,  between  US$100  and  US$170  billion, 
could  make  Russia  creditor  country  on  balance. 

Currency  and  Exchange  Rate:  Ruble.  In  July  1997,  US$1 
equaled  5,790  rubles. 

Fiscal  Year:  Calendar  year. 

Transportation  and  Telecommunications 

Roads:  934,000  kilometers  in  service  in  1995,  of  which  725,000 
kilometers  paved  or  gravel  and  of  which  445,000  kilometers 
serve  only  specific  industries  or  farms.  Automobile  travel 
expanding,  but  roads  inadequate  in  quality  and  quantity. 

Railroads:  154,000  kilometers  wide-gauge  in  1995,  of  which 
87,000  kilometers  for  common  carrier  service.  49,000 
kilometers  diesel,  and  38,000  kilometers  electrified.  Proportion 
of  cargo  shipping  by  rail  high  by  Western  standards.  System  in 
need  of  large-scale  repair. 

Civil  Aviation:  2,517  airports,  of  which  fifty-four  with  paved 
runways  over  3,047  meters.  In  1990s  hundreds  of  private 
airlines  formed.  Aeroflot,  the  state  monopoly  of  Soviet  Union, 
now  joint-stock  company  with  majority  of  stock  held  by 
government.  Major  international  airports  include 
Sheremet'evo  in  Moscow  and  Pulkovo  in  St.  Petersburg.  Flights 
to  most  major  world  capitals  and  major  cities  within 


xlvi 


Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS). 

Ports  and  Shipping:  Main  ports  Arkhangelsk,  Astrakhan', 
Kaliningrad,  Kazan',  Khabarovsk,  Kholmsk,  Krasnoyarsk, 
Magadan,  Moscow,  Murmansk,  Nakhodka,  Nevel'sk, 
Novorossiysk,  Petropavlovsk,  Rostov-na-Donu,  Sochi,  St. 
Petersburg,  Tuapse,  Vladivostok,  Volgograd,  Vostochnyy,  and 
Vyborg.  Merchant  fleet  800  vessels  in  1995.  Some  235  ships 
operating  under  Maltese,  Cypriot,  Liberian,  Panamanian,  St. 
Vincent  and  the  Grenadines,  Honduran,  Marshall  Islands, 
Bahamian,  and  Vanuatu  registry. 

Inland  waterways:  Total  navigable  routes  in  general  use 
101,000  kilometers. 

Pipelines:  Crude  oil,  48,000  kilometers;  petroleum  products, 
15,000  kilometers;  natural  gas,  140,000  kilometers. 

Telecommunications:  24,400,000  telephones;  20,900,000  in 
urban  areas  and  3,500,000  in  rural  areas  in  1995.  Development 
of  modern  communications  lines  and  acquisition  of  advanced 
equipment  slow.  Diversity  in  radio  and  television  programming 
increasing  since  late  1980s.  Access  to  Internet  and  cellular 
phones  expanding,  but  poor  state  of  telecommunications 
hinders  country's  modernization. 

Government  and  Politics 

Government:  Democratic,  federative  form  of  government 
under  1993  constitution.  Divided  into  executive,  legislative, 
and  judicial  branches.  President,  elected  to  four-year  term,  sets 
basic  tone  of  domestic  and  foreign  policy,  represents  state  at 
home  and  abroad.  Prime  minister  appoints  Government 
(cabinet)  to  administer  executive-branch  functions.  Forty 
ministries,  state  committees,  and  services;  reduction  in 
Government  size  planned  late  1996.  Prime  minister 
administers  policy  according  to  constitution,  laws,  and 
presidential  decrees.  New  Government  named  August  1996 
following  presidential  election,  retaining  some  key  members 
from  previous  administration.  Boris  N.  Yeltsin  president,  first 
elected  1991.  Viktor  Chernomyrdin  prime  minister,  reap- 
pointed August  1996.  Parliament,  bicameral  Federal  Assembly, 
has  lower  house,  State  Duma,  with  450  members  serving  four- 
year  terms;  last  election  December  1995.  Upper  house,  Fed- 
eration Council,  has  178  seats  (two  members  representing  the 
executive  and  legislative  bodies  of  each  of  the  eighty-nine 


xlvii 


subnational  jurisdictions).  Three  highest  judicial  bodies  Con- 
stitutional Court,  Supreme  Court,  and  Superior  Court  of  Arbi- 
tration. Judges  appointed  by  president  with  confirmation  from 
the  Federation  Council  required.  Jurisprudence  advancing 
slowly  toward  Western  standards;  jury  trials  held  only  in  some 
regions. 

Politics:  Largest  party  representation  in  State  Duma  by 
Communist  Party  of  the  Russian  Federation,  Liberal- 
Democratic  Party  of  Russia,  Our  Home  Is  Russia,  and  Yabloko 
coalition.  More  than  a  dozen  other  parties  have  representation 
in  State  Duma.  Personal  connections,  personalities  retain 
impact  in  politics  as  national  parties  develop  slowly, 
government  figures  avoid  party  affiliation;  shifting  coalitions 
typical  in  State  Duma.  Seventy-eight  nominal  independents  in 
State  Duma. 

Administrative  Divisions:  Twenty-one  autonomous  republics, 
forty-nine  oblasts  (provinces),  six  territories  (kraya;  sing.,  kray), 
ten  autonomous  regions  (okruga;  sing.,  okrug),  one  autono- 
mous oblast.  Cities  of  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  with  separate 
status  at  oblast  level. 

Foreign  Relations:  In  early  1990s,  basically  pro-Western,  drastic 
change  from  Soviet  era.  Russia  cofounded  Commonwealth  of 
Independent  States  (CIS)  in  1991  and  assumed  Soviet  Union 
seats  in  many  international  organizations.  Dependence  on 
foreign  assistance  greatly  increased  in  1990s.  Beginning  in 
1993,  substantial  domestic  political  pressure  mitigated  stance 
toward  participation  in  Western-dominated  organizations  and 
treaties,  reemphasis  of  independent  national  power.  So-called 
Eurasianism  assumes  unique  role  in  world  affairs  and  primary 
concerns  in  Asia  rather  than  Europe.  Chechnya  crisis  and 
nuclear  transactions  with  Iran  bring  international  criticism, 
although  summits  with  United  States  president  continue,  1997. 
Policy  toward  successor  states  marked  by  interest  in  reinte- 
gration of  CIS  countries  and  well-being  of  Russians  living 
outside  borders  of  Russian  Federation.  Expansion  of  North 
Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  into  Central  Europe 
major  issue  in  1996.  Other  key  issues  include  improvement  of 
relations  with  China  and  insistence  on  strict  interpretation  of 
the  Anti-Ballistic  Missile  Treaty  (ABM  Treaty).  Member  of 
Council  of  Europe,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and 
Development  (EBRD),  International  Labour  Organisation 
(ILO),  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  International

Criminal  Police  Organization  (Interpol),  NATO  Partnership 
for  Peace  (PfP),  United  Nations  (UN)  and  its  Security  Council, 
and  World  Bank. 

National  Security 

Armed  Forces:  Approximately  1.5  million  personnel  in  1996, 
but  sharp  cuts  and  reorganization  forecast.  Term  of  active  duty 
two  years.  Units  filled  mainly  by  conscription,  with  some 
contract  personnel.  Women  may  serve  if  they  possess 
specialized  skills.  Armed  forces  divided  into  ground  forces, 
naval  forces,  air  forces,  air  defense  forces,  strategic  rocket 
forces.  Ground  forces  personnel  670,000  (210,000  conscripts); 
naval  forces  200,000  (40,000  conscripts);  air  forces  130,000 
(40,000  conscripts);  air  defense  forces  200,000  (60,000 
conscripts);  strategic  rocket  forces  100,000  (50,000  conscripts). 

Military  Presence  Overseas:  Transcaucasus  Group  of  Forces — 
9,000  personnel  in  Armenia,  with  one  air  defense  MiG-23 
squadron.  22,000  personnel  in  Georgia,  with  one  air  force 
composite  regiment  of  thirty-five  aircraft.  Azerbaijan  refuses 
Russian  troop  presence.  Forces  in  other  former  Soviet 
republics:  Moldova  6,400  personnel,  Tajikistan  12,000 
personnel,  Turkmenistan  11,000  personnel,  and  several 
thousand  each  in  Kazakstan  and  Kyrgyzstan.  Contributions  to 
UN  missions  in  Angola,  Bosnia,  Croatia,  Georgia,  Haiti,  Iraq/ 
Kuwait,  Former  Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia,  Rwanda,  and 
Western  Sahara.  Signal  and  intelligence  personnel  in  Vietnam, 
Syria,  Cuba,  Mongolia,  and  parts  of  Africa. 

Military  Budget:  1997  defense  budget  submitted  August  1996 
allots  100.8  trillion  rubles  (about  US$19  billion),  of  260  trillion 
rubles  requested  by  Ministry  of  Defense.  Anticipated  1998 
budget  somewhat  higher.  Maintenance  and  salaries  far  below 
required  levels.  Anti-inflationary  budget  restraints  cause 
dissension  among  ministries  and  continued  military  morale 
decline. 

Internal  Security  Forces:  Reorganized  after  fall  of  Soviet  Union 
but  with  many  extraconstitutional  functions  ongoing  and  only 
partial  transparency.  Power,  but  not  effectiveness,  grows  as 
crime  wave  continues  in  mid-1990s.  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs 
had  540,000  troops,  including  regular  police  and  special  units, 
in  1996.  Federal  Border  Service,  135,000  troops  in  1994,  then 
augmented  substantially.  Main  Guard  Directorate  (presidential 


xlix 


guard),  20,000  troops,  1994.  Troops  of  Federal  Security  Service 
and  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  heavily  involved  in  Chechnya 
conflict,  1994-96.

Introduction 


RUSSIA  IS  THE  LARGEST  of  the  fifteen  geopolitical  entities 
that  emerged  in  1991  from  the  Soviet  Union.  Covering  more 
than  17  million  square  kilometers  in  Europe  and  Asia,  Russia 
succeeded  the  Soviet  Union  as  the  largest  country  in  the  world. 
As  was  the  case  in  the  Soviet  and  tsarist  eras,  the  center  of  Rus- 
sia's population  and  economic  activity  is  the  European  sector, 
which  occupies  about  one-quarter  of  the  country's  territory. 
Vast  tracts  of  land  in  Asian  Russia  are  virtually  unoccupied. 
Although  numerous  Soviet  programs  had  attempted  to  popu- 
late and  exploit  resources  in  Siberia  and  the  Arctic  regions  of 
the  Russian  Republic,  the  population  of  Russia's  remote  areas 
decreased  in  the  1990s.  Thirty-nine  percent  of  Russia's  terri- 
tory but  only  6  percent  of  its  population  in  1996  was  located 
east  of  Lake  Baikal,  the  geographical  landmark  in  south-central 
Siberia.  The  territorial  extent  of  the  country  constitutes  a 
major  economic  and  political  problem  for  Russian  govern- 
ments lacking  the  far-reaching  authoritarian  clout  of  their 
Soviet  predecessors. 

In  the  Soviet  political  system,  which  was  self-described  as  a 
democratic  federation  of  republics,  the  center  of  authority  for 
almost  all  actions  of  consequence  was  Moscow,  the  capital  of 
the  Russian  Republic.  After  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  in 
1991,  that  long-standing  concentration  of  power  meant  that 
many  of  the  other  fourteen  republics  faced  independence 
without  any  experience  at  self-governance.  For  Russia,  the  end 
of  the  Soviet  Union  meant  facing  the  world  without  the  consid- 
erable buffer  zone  of  Soviet  republics  that  had  protected  and 
nurtured  it  in  various  ways  since  the  1920s;  the  change 
required  complete  reorganization  of  what  had  become  a  thor- 
oughly corrupt  and  ineffectual  socialist  system. 

Under  those  circumstances,  Russia  has  undergone  an  ago- 
nizing process  of  self-analysis  and  refocusing  of  national  goals. 
That  process,  which  seemingly  had  only  begun  in  the  mid- 
1990s,  has  been  observed  and  commented  upon  with  more 
analytic  energy  than  any  similar  transformation  in  the  history 
of  the  world.  As  information  pours  out  past  the  ruins  of  the 
Iron  Curtain,  a  new,  more  reliable  portrait  of  Russia  emerges, 
but  substantial  mystery  remains.

In  a  history-making  year,  the  regime  of  President  Mikhail  S. 
Gorbachev  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  mortally  injured  by  an 
unsuccessful  coup  in  August  1991.  After  all  the  constituent 
republics,  including  Russia,  had  voted  for  independence  in  the 
months  that  followed  the  coup,  Gorbachev  announced  in 
December  1991  that  the  nation  would  cease  to  exist.  In  place  of 
the  monolithic  union,  there  remained  the  Commonwealth  of 
Independent  States  (CIS — see  Glossary),  a  loose  confederation 
of  eleven  of  the  former  Soviet  republics,  which  now  were  inde- 
pendent states  with  an  indefinite  mandate  of  mutual  coopera- 
tion. By  late  1991,  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union 
(CPSU — see  Glossary)  and  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Russian 
Republic  had  been  banned  in  Russia,  and  Boris  N.  Yeltsin,  who 
had  been  elected  president  of  the  Russian  Republic  in  June 
1991,  had  become  the  leader  of  the  new  Russian  Federation. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Yeltsin's  appeals  for  political  reform  gained 
him  the  enmity  of  the  communist  hierarchy,  including  Gor- 
bachev, but  he  won  the  support  of  a  Russian  public  whose  self- 
expression  had  been  liberated  by  Gorbachev's  own  policy  of 
glasnost  (literally,  public  voicing — see  Glossary).  In  that  period, 
the  atmosphere  of  Russia,  especially  its  main  cities,  Moscow 
and  Leningrad,  was  one  of  expectation  that  significant  political 
changes  finally  would  occur  after  the  sclerotic  decades  of  the 
Brezhnev  regime  (1964-82).  The  first  years  of  Yeltsin's  presi- 
dency, which  began  with  an  overt  challenge  to  the  Soviet 
Union's  authority  over  Russian  affairs,  brought  a  surge  of  activ- 
ity that  promised  economic  and  political  reform  and  an  end  to 
the  economic  stagnation  and  social  malaise  of  the  1980s.  Both 
Russians  and  Westerners  hoped  that  Russia  could  make  a  short, 
painless  transformation  to  democratic  rule  and  free-market 
economics.  Although  events  of  the  first  five  post-Soviet  years 
provided  some  reasons  for  optimism,  all  observers  soon  real- 
ized that  whatever  transformation  Russia  was  to  experience 
would  require  much  more  time,  and  would  yield  much  less  pre- 
dictable results,  than  initially  expected. 

At  the  time  it  became  independent,  the  Russian  Federation 
included  nineteen  autonomous  republics,  ten  autonomous 
regions,  and  one  autonomous  oblast,  each  designated  for  a 
particular  ethnic  group.  The  ethnically  Russian  population  was 
(and  remains)  the  largest  group  in  all  but  a  handful  of  the 
republics  and  autonomous  regions;  most  of  the  exceptions, 
where  the  local  ethnic  groups  constitute  a  majority,  are  located 
in  the  North  Caucasus. 


liv 


In  1989  the  Baltic  republics'  declarations  of  sovereignty 
within  the  Soviet  Union  began  a  cascade  of  similar  declarations 
by  jurisdictions  within  Russia.  In  the  second  half  of  1990  alone, 
ten  of  Russia's  autonomous  republics  declared  sovereignty. 
When  Russia  became  an  independent  state,  perceptions  of 
Moscow's  weakness  further  encouraged  separatist  movements, 
which  in  turn  prompted  a  long-term  campaign  by  the  Yeltsin 
government  to  maintain  the  federation  intact.  Although  some 
experts  predicted  that  the  Russian  Federation  ultimately  would 
suffer  the  same  fragmentation  as  the  Soviet  Union,  little  evi- 
dence of  such  an  outcome  has  been  seen  in  the  first  five  years 
of  the  post-Soviet  era. 

In  1992  Moscow  began  the  struggle  to  preserve  the  federa- 
tion by  inducing  all  but  two  autonomous  republics  (Chechnya 
and  Tatarstan)  to  sign  the  Federation  Treaty  defining  the 
respective  areas  of  jurisdiction  of  the  national  and  regional 
governments.  The  treaty  included  definitions  of  sovereignty 
over  natural  resources  and  other  economic  assets.  Since  the 
treaty  was  signed,  Moscow's  hegemony  has  been  threatened  in 
several  other  instances,  the  most  notable  being  the  Republic  of 
Chechnya's  fulfillment  of  its  1991  declaration  of  independence 
by  a  coup  against  the  republic's  Russian-controlled  government 
in  1993.  Chechnya's  defiance  and  the  hapless  military  response 
that  Russia  initiated  against  the  republic  in  1994  encouraged 
other  regions  to  seek  more  power.  In  most  cases,  including  oil- 
rich  Tatarstan  and  diamond-rich  Sakha  (Yakutia),  the  Yeltsin 
government  has  signed  compromise  bilateral  treaties  assuaging 
local  demands,  which  are  mostly  economic.  Some  of  Russia's 
fifty-five  lesser  jurisdictions — the  six  territories  and  the  forty- 
nine  oblasts — have  made  similar  demands.  Because  the  federal 
government  has  not  been  able  to  enforce  its  policies  on  a  num- 
ber of  issues,  the  jurisdictions  have  taken  varying  approaches  to 
economic  and  political  reform,  creating  a  patchwork  effect 
that  has  inhibited  interregional  cooperation. 

The  military  failure  in  Chechnya  was  the  most  obvious  indi- 
cation of  a  grave  overall  decline  in  post-Soviet  Russia's  military 
establishment.  The  Soviet  military  earned  society's  gratitude  by 
its  performance  in  the  Great  Patriotic  War  (as  World  War  II  is 
commonly  called  in  Russia),  a  costly  but  unified  and  heroic 
defense  of  the  homeland  against  invading  Nazi  armies.  In  the 
postwar  era,  the  Soviet  military  maintained  its  positive  image 
and  budgetary  support  in  good  part  because  of  incessant  gov- 


lv 


ernment  propaganda  about  the  need  to  defend  the  country 
against  the  capitalist  West. 

The  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union  also  ended  much  of  the 
threat  of  military  confrontation  between  Russia  and  the  West 
that  had  characterized  the  Cold  War.  Already  in  the  mid-1980s, 
however,  Soviet  military  doctrine  had  begun  shifting  to  a  more 
defensive  posture  in  recognition  of  the  country's  economic 
limitations,  even  as  Soviet  occupation  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see 
Glossary)  nations  and  of  Afghanistan  continued.  Beginning  in 
1988,  the  Soviet  military  establishment  suffered  a  series  of 
major  blows.  The  military  operation  in  Afghanistan,  which  had 
little  success  against  fervid  guerrilla  forces,  was  declared  a  fail- 
ure in  1988,  and  Soviet  forces  withdrew  after  nearly  ten  years  of 
combat.  In  1989  the  Warsaw  Pact  alliance  began  to  disintegrate 
as  all  the  East  European  member  nations  rejected  their  com- 
munist governments;  the  alliance  dissolved  in  1991,  and  by 
1994  all  Russian  forces  had  left  Eastern  Europe. 

The  third  blow,  the  end  of  the  Soviet  Union  itself,  required 
withdrawal  of  troops  stationed  in  the  other  fourteen  republics; 
in  this  process,  much  equipment  and  weaponry  was  left  behind 
and  claimed  by  the  newly  independent  states.  The  successive 
return  of  large  numbers  of  troops  into  Russia  after  each  of 
these  three  events  caused  an  enormous  logistical  problem  for 
the  military;  furthermore,  the  morale  of  the  institution  was 
seriously  eroded  by  withdrawals  of  unprecedented  magnitude 
from  regions  assumed  to  be  permanent  parts  of  the  Soviet 
domain.  At  the  same  time,  serious  examples  of  corruption 
were  exposed  at  the  highest  command  levels  of  the  armed 
forces. 

In  1992  the  Russian  Federation  inherited  the  bulk  of  the 
Soviet  Union's  armed  forces  as  well  as  all  of  their  problems.  In 
the  early  1990s,  there  were  new  ramifications  of  the  morale  and 
command  problems  that  had  surfaced  earlier.  In  a  new  social 
environment  of  permissiveness  and  diversification,  increasing 
numbers  of  Russia's  youth  rejected  military  service  as  a  patri- 
otic duty,  many  top  individuals  in  the  junior  officer  corps 
resigned  because  of  poor  pay  and  housing,  and  the  incidence 
of  crime  increased  significantly.  At  the  same  time,  corruption 
and  politicization  destroyed  the  unity  that  had  characterized 
the  senior  officer  corps  during  the  Soviet  era.  These  changes 
all  occurred  as  the  need  for  a  new  set  of  national  security 
guidelines  became  increasingly  evident.  Within  a  few  years, 
both  the  geopolitical  and  the  budgetary  conditions  of  Russia's 


lvi 


military  had  changed  dramatically  without  appropriate  adjust- 
ments in  military  doctrine.  Although  the  size  of  the  military 
was  reduced  between  1992  and  1996  from  about  2.8  million 
personnel  to  about  1.5  million,  reductions  were  disproportion- 
ately high  in  the  enlisted  ranks,  leaving  a  bloated  officer  corps. 
In  1996  both  the  military  doctrine  (which  was  updated  frag- 
mentarily  in  1993)  and  military  equipment  still  reflected  the 
Soviet-era  priority  of  large-scale  mechanized  land  war  and/or 
nuclear  war  to  be  fought  on  the  continent  of  Europe. 

In  1996  elements  of  a  new  military  doctrine  appeared,  but 
fundamental  conflict  remained  between  reformers  and  hard- 
liners in  the  policy-making  establishment.  The  strong  positions 
taken  by  the  opposing  sides  suggested  that  enacting  a  compre- 
hensive new  doctrine  would  involve  a  long  struggle.  Despite 
the  diminished  capability  of  Russia's  economy  to  support  the 
military,  hard-liners  insisted  that  major  reductions  would  dam- 
age national  security.  As  budgetary  support  of  routine  military 
readiness  has  shrunk  drastically  in  the  mid-1990s,  calls  for 
large-scale  reform  have  intensified.  Among  the  main  reform 
elements  cited  are  downsizing  the  armed  forces,  shifting  their 
emphasis  to  mobile  warfare,  eliminating  much  of  the  corrupt 
and  flabby  corps  of  senior  officers,  relying  more  heavily  on  con- 
tract volunteers  rather  than  conscripts,  and  discarding  the  con- 
cept of  military  parity  with  the  United  States.  In  July  1996,  the 
State  Duma  (the  lower  house  of  the  Russian  parliament)  began 
hearings  on  reform  measures.  In  December  the  Duma  recom- 
mended the  formation  of  a  federal  department  to  set  military 
reform  guidelines  through  2005,  together  with  a  25  percent 
increase  in  the  military  budget. 

The  condition  of  the  military  forces  remains  an  important 
part  of  Russia's  national  self-image.  The  Chechnya  conflict,  the 
first  post-Soviet  test  of  those  forces,  revealed  shocking  insuffi- 
ciencies even  in  elite  units.  In  mid-1996  the  dismissal  of  Minis- 
ter of  Defense  Pavel  Grachev,  upon  whom  the  most  blame  for 
Chechnya  had  been  heaped,  produced  no  visible  improve- 
ment. In  August  1996,  the  sudden  loss  of  the  Chechen  capital 
of  Groznyy,  from  which  Russian  forces  had  driven  the  Chechen 
guerrillas  in  1995,  forced  the  withdrawal  of  Russian  forces 
under  the  terms  of  the  cease-fire  that  followed. 

In  the  second  half  of  1996,  ultimate  responsibility  for  mili- 
tary policy  remained  balanced  uncertainly  between  civilian  and 
military  authorities,  as  it  was  when  Grachev  was  minister  of 
defense.  In  November  1996,  a  call  for  a  new  military  doctrine 


lvii 


by  Yeltsin's  civilian  Defense  Council  met  stiff  resistance  from 
the  Ministry  of  Defense. 

Grachev's  successor,  Igor'  Rodionov,  inherited  a  force  with 
plummeting  morale,  gravely  deteriorating  materiel  support, 
minimal  training,  and  no  clear  doctrine.  In  the  second  draft 
call  of  1996,  an  estimated  37,000  men  out  of  a  target  number  of 
215,000  conscripts  failed  to  report.  This  was  the  largest 
recorded  episode  of  draft  dodging  since  the  establishment  of 
the  Soviet  Union.  The  budget  passed  in  January  1997  added 
only  token  amounts  to  the  1996  allotment  of  US$19  billion. 
The  budget  provided  for  only  about  38  percent  of  the  Ministry 
of  Defense's  budget  request  and  made  no  allowance  for  infla- 
tion. The  1997  budget  package  caused  Rodionov  to  curse  the 
Ministry  of  Finance  as  Grachev  had,  intensifying  tensions 
among  the  "power  ministries"  of  the  Government  (cabinet). 
Meanwhile,  in  the  last  months  of  1996  the  pay  arrears  of  the 
Ministry  of  Defense  mounted  steadily,  and  there  were  rumors 
that  military  strike  committees  had  been  formed.  Already  in 
August,  an  estimated  US$2.8  billion  was  owed  to  Russia's  mili- 
tary personnel.  Rodionov  also  repeated  Grachev's  complaint 
that  military  units  of  the  internal  security  agencies  received 
funding  that  should  go  to  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  The  exact 
troop  levels  of  those  units  are  unknown,  but  in  the  second  half 
of  1996  some  estimates  exceeded  1  million. 

Rodionov  predicted  that  the  grandiose  plans  of  Yeltsin  and 
others  for  military  restructuring  and  modernization  would  be 
frustrated  without  significant  expenditures  in  the  transition 
period.  The  plans  included  large-scale  force  reduction,  a  new 
military  doctrine  matching  Russia's  less  stressful  post-Cold-War 
geopolitical  position,  and  possibly  an  all-volunteer  force.  In 
January  1997,  the  Ministry  of  Defense  submitted  a  reform  plan 
whose  first  step  was  increased  funding.  The  Defense  Council 
submitted  a  rival,  long-term  plan  extending  beyond  2005  and 
calling  for  30  percent  reductions  in  defense  and  non-defense 
troop  levels  as  the  first  reform  step,  citing  the  country's  low 
financial  resources.  The  conflicting  emphasis  of  the  two  plans 
exacerbated  the  existing  disagreements  in  the  defense  estab- 
lishment, specifically  between  Rodionov  and  Defense  Council 
chief  Yuriy  Baturin,  over  the  direction  of  reform. 

Meanwhile,  accusations  of  corruption  and  incompetence  in 
the  military  establishment  continued,  with  Duma  Defense 
Committee  chairman  Lev  Rokhlin,  a  retired  general,  levying 
the  most  serious  charges.  Those  charges  combined  with  the 


lviii 


military's  abject  failure  in  Chechnya  to  further  erode  the 
authority  of  the  Ministry  of  Defense  under  Rodionov.  In 
December  1996,  Yeltsin  forced  Rodionov  to  resign  his  commis- 
sion in  order  to  move  the  ministry  toward  civilian  rather  than 
military  control. 

As  Russia's  military  deteriorated,  the  arms  export  activities 
of  its  defense  industries  continued  to  grow.  In  1995  Russia 
exported  more  arms  to  developing  countries  than  any  other 
producer;  China  was  its  best  customer.  Total  1995  sales  were 
estimated  at  US$6  billion,  an  increase  of  62  percent  over  1994. 
At  the  end  of  1996,  defense  authorities  announced  that  foreign 
arms  sales  would  play  a  prominent  role  in  financing  military 
reform  in  coming  years.  In  early  1997,  Russia  angered  the  West 
by  selling  S-300  missile  systems  to  the  Republic  of  Cyprus  and 
by  selling  a  third  Kilo-class  diesel  submarine  to  Iran. 

Some  of  the  most  visible  domestic  products  of  the  arms 
industry  suffered  production  delays  in  1996.  In  November  con- 
struction began  on  the  Yuriy  Dolgorukiy,  the  first  in  the  new 
Severodvinsk  class  of  strategic  missile  submarines  described  as 
superior  to  any  existing  model  and  expected  to  carry  Russia's 
sea-based  nuclear  missiles  after  2000.  Plans  had  called  for  three 
such  boats  to  go  into  production  in  1996.  The  Petr  Velikiy,  a 
powerful,  heavily  armed  cruiser  whose  keel  was  laid  in  1986, 
finally  took  its  maiden  voyage  in  October  1996  after  years  of 
production  delays.  In  March  1997,  the  Moscow  Aviation  Pro- 
duction Association  (MAPO)  postponed  serial  production  of 
an  advanced  multifunctional  fighter,  targeting  instead  the 
MiG-35  fighter  destined  for  overseas  sales. 

The  agencies  of  internal  security  have  fared  better  than  the 
military  in  the  post-Soviet  era.  Throughout  the  Soviet  period, 
these  agencies  were  among  the  most  firmly  entrenched  and 
respected  national  institutions.  A  succession  of  internal  secu- 
rity agencies,  ending  with  the  Committee  for  State  Security 
(Komitet  gosudarstvennoy  bezopasnosti — KGB;  see  Glossary), 
struck  fear  in  the  Soviet  population  by  thoroughly  penetrating 
all  of  society  and  launching  periodic  purges  (the  most  violent 
of  which  occurred  in  the  1930s)  against  elements  of  society 
deemed  harmful  to  the  socialist  state. 

In  the  post-Soviet  era,  internal  security  agencies  generally 
have  received  more  solid  support  from  the  Yeltsin  government 
than  the  armed  forces,  although  specific  agencies  have  been 
favored.  The  Federal  Security  Service  (FSB),  the  most  direct 
successor  to  the  KGB,  has  a  broad  mandate  for  intelligence 


lix 


gathering  inside  Russia  and  abroad  when  national  security  is 
threatened,  and  no  concrete  governmental  oversight  is  pre- 
scribed in  legislation.  Human  rights  advocates  in  Russia  and 
elsewhere,  sensitive  to  the  precedent  of  unbridled  KGB  power, 
have  criticized  the  direct  presidential  control  of  internal  secu- 
rity agencies  such  as  the  FSB,  and  human  rights  violations  have 
been  documented.  Armed  units  of  the  FSB  and  the  Ministry  of 
Internal  Affairs  (MVD)  were  heavily  involved  in  the  Chechnya 
campaign. 

Russia's  still-powerful  internal  security  agencies  also  were  hit 
by  scandal  in  1996  when  the  former  financial  head  of  the  Fede- 
ral Agency  for  Government  Communications  and  Information 
(FAPSI)  was  imprisoned  by  its  sister  agency,  the  FSB,  for 
embezzling  large  sums  from  the  FAPSI  budget.  Although  the 
affair  received  no  official  acknowledgment,  the  independent 
press  reported  a  major  power  struggle  between  powerful  suc- 
cessor agencies  of  the  KGB.  Such  a  scenario  would  continue  a 
series  of  rearrangements  of  the  former  KGB  agencies  that  have 
occurred  in  the  1990s  because  of  political  power  struggles 
rather  than  security  considerations. 

Rampant,  well-publicized  corruption  in  the  security  agencies 
has  eroded  public  confidence  in  all  of  Russian  law  enforce- 
ment. In  July  1996,  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  (MVD) 
reported  that  1,400  employees  of  the  regular  police  (militia) 
had  been  arrested  in  1995  for  various  types  of  criminal  activity, 
including  participation  in  crimes  by  criminal  organizations  of 
the  mafiya.  That  report  was  the  result  of  the  MVD's  Clean 
Hands  Campaign,  a  highly  publicized  public-confidence  pro- 
gram begun  in  1995  to  purge  law  enforcement  agencies  of  dis- 
honest members.  But,  according  to  most  accounts,  the  1995 
arrests  removed  only  a  very  small  part  of  Russia's  internal  secu- 
rity corruption. 

Russia  has  experimented  cautiously  with  Western-style  juris- 
prudence and  penal  reform.  In  the  mid-1990s,  jury  trials  were 
introduced  in  some  regions,  and  the  rights  of  accused  persons 
and  prison  inmates  were  stipulated  more  concretely.  Neverthe- 
less, major  elements  of  the  Soviet  system  remain  in  the  juris- 
prudence of  the  Russian  Federation.  For  example,  procurators 
(public  prosecutors)  still  have  both  investigative  and  prosecu- 
torial functions,  and  expansion  of  the  jury  system  has  met  sub- 
stantial resistance  among  entrenched  Soviet-era  judges  and 
procurators.  In  addition,  prison  conditions  have  deteriorated 
substantially  because  Russia's  crime  wave  has  increased  the 


Ix 


prison  population  but  funding  is  not  available  for  new  facilities. 
In  early  1997,  more  than  one-quarter  of  the  prison  population 
was  awaiting  trial,  and  pretrial  detention  lasted  as  long  as  three 
years  for  some  individuals.  Russia's  procurator  general,  Yuriy 
Skuratov,  reported  that  his  office  had  been  overwhelmed  in 
1996  with  1.2  million  court  cases,  for  which  it  had  only  about 
7,000  investigators.  He  noted  that  the  same  trend  was  continu- 
ing in  1997. 

After  many  delays  and  amendments,  a  new  Criminal  Code 
went  into  effect  on  January  1,  1997.  An  estimated  150,000  crim- 
inal cases  were  expected  to  require  review  based  on  the  new 
code,  and  many  prisoners  will  be  released  because  the  laws 
under  which  they  were  convicted  no  longer  exist.  A  separate 
criminal  correction  code  defining  conditions  in  the  prison  sys- 
tem was  scheduled  to  go  into  effect  in  July  1997. 

Compounding  Russia's  other  problems  are  deteriorating 
environmental  conditions,  the  extent  of  which  became  clear 
only  gradually  during  the  1990s.  Among  the  most  serious  haz- 
ards in  Russia  are  pollution  of  ground  water  and  bodies  of 
water  in  most  of  European  Russia;  air  pollution  from  the  vent- 
ing of  unprocessed  industrial  by-products;  large  concentrations 
of  waste  chemicals  from  industry  and  agriculture;  and  actual 
and  potential  radiological  pollution  from  civilian  and  military 
nuclear  installations. 

In  August  1996,  the  Bellona  Foundation  of  Oslo,  long  a 
vocal  critic  of  Russia's  nuclear  waste  procedures,  issued  a  damn- 
ing report  on  the  threat  posed  to  Arctic  regions  by  Russia's 
nuclear  waste  disposal  practices  and  at  least  thirty-six  decom- 
missioned nuclear  submarines  at  anchor  near  Murmansk  with 
their  reactors  on  board.  Bellona  described  the  Murmansk 
region  as  having  the  world's  largest  concentration  of  active  and 
defunct  nuclear  reactors,  many  of  which  are  not  maintained  or 
disposed  of  properly.  According  to  the  report,  the  FSB 
obstructed  the  foundation's  investigation  and  imprisoned  Alek- 
sandr  Nikitin,  the  retired  Russian  naval  officer  who  was  a  key 
author  of  the  report.  As  Nikitin's  trial  was  delayed  repeatedly, 
his  case  attracted  international  protests. 

Meanwhile,  the  interdepartmental  Commission  for  Ecologi- 
cal Safety,  headed  by  senior  environmental  authority  Aleksey 
Yablokov,  continued  releasing  shocking  statistics  about  Russia's 
environmental  quality.  For  example,  in  1996  one  in  five  tap- 
water  samples  failed  to  meet  public  health  chemical  standards, 
and  about  40  percent  of  sewage  was  being  dumped  untreated 


lxi 


into  bodies  of  water,  with  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  among 
the  regions  most  affected.  In  the  second  half  of  1996,  Yablokov 
lobbied  Yeltsin  unsuccessfully  to  expand  the  ecological  safety 
commission  and  its  funding. 

Russian  environmentalists  won  a  battle  in  December  1996 
when  a  regional  referendum  soundly  rejected  completion  of 
the  Kostroma  Nuclear  Power  Station,  on  which  construction 
had  been  suspended  after  the  Chernobyl'  disaster  of  1986.  This 
was  Russia's  first  referendum  on  such  an  issue;  the  59  percent 
turnout  made  the  vote  legally  binding.  In  February  1997,  the 
Republic  of  Sakha  announced  plans  to  conserve  one-quarter  of 
its  vast  Siberian  territory,  including  the  world's  largest  tract  of 
virgin  forest,  protecting  several  endangered  species  and  the 
shrinking  indigenous  population  of  Evenk  nomads.  That  plan 
bypassed  national  authorities — an  increasingly  frequent  trend 
in  environmental  and  other  matters.  The  Sakha  government 
received  a  support  grant  directly  from  a  Swiss  environmental 
organization. 

The  "social  umbrella"  of  the  Soviet  Union's  socialist  system, 
which  nominally  had  guaranteed  all  citizens  employment, 
health  care,  child  care,  pensions,  and  universal,  high-quality 
education,  also  encountered  problems.  By  the  1980s,  many  of 
the  more  than  200  million  citizens  covered  by  the  umbrella 
began  receiving  fewer  benefits  or  benefits  of  lesser  quality.  The 
Soviet  education  and  health  systems,  which  offered  top-quality 
service  only  to  the  country's  political,  scientific,  and  cultural 
elite,  were  undermined  by  the  infrastructural  and  organiza- 
tional failures  inherent  in  such  centrally  planned  systems.  The 
Soviet  concept  of  guaranteed  employment  eroded  the  national 
economy  by  encouraging  slipshod  labor  and  malingering. 

In  the  1990s,  the  state's  social  welfare  system  retained  the 
bureaucratic  complexities  of  the  Soviet  era,  but  it  did  not  keep 
pace  with  the  needs  of  society.  As  runaway  inflation  devalued 
the  fixed  payments  of  the  pension  system,  many  citizens 
depending  on  fixed  incomes  fell  below  the  official  poverty  line, 
which  in  late  1996  was  about  US$67  per  month.  In  1996  an  esti- 
mated 30  percent  of  those  with  fixed  incomes  and  about  24 
percent  of  the  total  population  were  in  that  category.  The  gov- 
ernment's failure  to  index  welfare  programs  also  reduced  the 
value  of  a  wide  variety  of  other  entitlements  that  had  provided 
Soviet  workers  with  substantial  savings  in  the  cost  of  living.  Nev- 
ertheless, Soviet-era  programs  such  as  maternity  leave,  child 
care,  free  medical  facilities,  and  housing  subsidies  remained 


lxii 


substantially  unchanged  in  the  mid-1990s,  continuing  expecta- 
tions that  increasingly  strained  the  federal  budget. 

Reforms  such  as  pension  indexation  and  differentiation  of 
individual  contributions  to  pension  funds  were  only  beginning 
to  appear  in  the  mid-1990s.  By  that  time,  the  government's 
inability  to  collect  taxes  and  other  obligated  funds  had  had  a 
major  impact  on  social  programs.  In  the  fall  of  1996,  an  esti- 
mated US$3  billion  in  pension  payments  were  overdue.  At  that 
point,  the  Pension  Fund,  which  is  administered  by  the  Ministry 
of  Social  Protection,  was  owed  US$8.5  billion  by  the  enterprises 
that  are  the  main  contributors.  The  federal  budget  also  owed 
money  to  the  fund,  which  by  mid-1996  had  exhausted  its  com- 
mercial bank  credits  by  taking  loans  to  make  pension  pay- 
ments. 

Russia's  health  care  system  also  deteriorated  substantially  in 
the  1990s.  Equipment  and  medicines  are  in  increasingly  short 
supply,  aging  facilities  have  not  been  replaced,  and  existing 
facilities  often  are  inaccessible.  Medical  personnel  generally 
are  not  trained  as  rigorously  as  their  contemporaries  in  the 
West,  and  chronic  failures  to  pay  doctors  and  nurses  have  exac- 
erbated shortages  in  those  professions.  The  1997  national  bud- 
get allocated  US$1.6  billion  for  health,  an  increase  of  US$158 
million  over  1996,  but  most  of  the  new  money  was  targeted  for 
medical  centers  in  large  cities.  The  1997  figure  was  2.6  percent 
of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary),  compared 
with  the  World  Health  Organization's  recommended  mini- 
mum share  of  5  percent. 

Failures  in  health  care  are  one  aspect  of  an  increasingly 
grave  health  crisis  afflicting  the  Russian  population  as  a  whole 
in  the  1990s.  Other  elements  of  the  crisis  include  widespread 
and  acute  environmental  pollution  of  various  types,  which  gov- 
ernment programs  and  nongovernmental  "green"  organiza- 
tions have  not  been  able  to  ameliorate;  the  continued  heavy 
use  of  tobacco  and  alcohol  and  a  growing  narcotics  addiction 
problem;  and  poor  hygiene  and  nutrition  practices  among 
large  portions  of  the  population. 

In  the  first  ten  months  of  1996,  confirmed  cases  of  human 
immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  were  four  times  more  numer- 
ous than  in  all  of  1995,  with  drug  addicts  accounting  for  about 
70  percent  of  cases.  Although  the  official  estimate  of  HIV  cases 
was  fewer  than  2,000  in  1996,  other  estimates  placed  the  num- 
ber at  ten  times  that  many.  The  Ministry  of  Health  reported 
that  only  50,000  of  Russia's  estimated  2  million  drug  addicts 


lxiii 


were  under  treatment  for  their  addiction  in  1996.  In  1996 
health  experts  identified  alcoholism  as  the  number-one  cause 
of  premature  death  in  Russia,  a  situation  exacerbated  by  the 
estimated  68  percent  of  alcohol  products  that  contain  foreign 
substances.  By  1995  Russia's  average  life  expectancy  had  fallen 
to  only  fifty-seven  years  for  males  and  seventy-one  for  females, 
and  natural  population  growth  has  been  negative  since  1992. 
In  the  first  nine  months  of  1996,  the  population  showed  a  net 
decrease  of  350,000,  dropping  to  147.6  million  according  to 
the  State  Committee  for  Statistics. 

Russia's  education  system  has  suffered  from  the  same  short- 
ages and  lack  of  support  as  its  health  system.  And  education, 
accorded  high  value  in  Soviet  society,  seems  to  have  lost  some 
of  its  esteem  in  a  fragmented  Russian  society  where  many  tradi- 
tional institutions  are  viewed  with  unprecedented  skepticism. 
In  the  1990s,  the  centralized,  rigid  Soviet  education  system  has 
given  way  to  a  system  that  gives  localities  substantial  autonomy 
in  shaping  curricula  and  hiring  teachers.  This  opportunity  for 
creativity  has  been  hampered,  however,  by  two  conditions: 
because  many  Soviet-trained  Russian  educators  do  not  under- 
stand individual  initiative  and  autonomy,  many  schools  have 
perpetuated  the  rote  memorization  methods  of  the  past;  and, 
as  in  other  aspects  of  Russian  social  policy,  funding  for  person- 
nel and  infrastructure  has  been  woefully  inadequate.  Teachers, 
always  underpaid  in  the  Soviet  system,  have  been  impoverished 
by  the  Russian  system,  and  many  have  left  the  profession  since 
1992.  In  this  atmosphere,  private  schools  have  begun  to  offer 
creative  curricula  to  students  who  can  afford  to  eschew  public 
schooling.  According  to  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Ilyushin, 
by  October  1996  education  and  culture  had  received  only  65 
percent  and  30  percent,  respectively,  of  the  1996  budget  funds 
allotted  to  them.  In  late  1996  and  early  1997,  the  highest  pro- 
portion of  striking  workers  were  teachers. 

Beginning  in  the  late  1980s,  religion  assumed  a  more  impor- 
tant role  in  the  lives  of  many  Russians,  and  in  the  life  of  the 
Russian  state  as  well.  Russian  Orthodoxy,  the  dominant  reli- 
gion of  Russia  since  the  ruler  Vladimir  accepted  Christianity  in 
A.D.  988,  was  subservient  to  the  state  from  the  time  of  Peter  the 
Great  (r.  1682-1725)  until  1917;  nevertheless,  it  exerted  a  pow- 
erful influence  on  the  spiritual  lives  of  most  Russians.  In  the 
Soviet  period,  the  activities  of  the  church  were  further 
restricted  as  most  churches  and  monasteries  were  closed  and 
religious  observances  strongly  discouraged. 


Ixiv 


In  the  late  1980s,  the  Gorbachev  regime  began  to  restore  the 
church's  property  and  rights;  official  observance  of  the  millen- 
nium of  Russian  Orthodoxy  in  1988  was  a  watershed  event  in 
that  process.  Beginning  in  1992,  the  Russian  Orthodox  patri- 
archate, which  had  been  restored  in  1917  only  to  be  repressed 
for  the  next  seventy  years,  assumed  growing  influence  in  state 
as  well  as  spiritual  affairs.  Many  churches  were  built  and 
restored,  and  in  the  early  1990s  millions  of  Russians  returned 
to  regular  worship.  However,  by  early  1997  Orthodox  Russians 
attended  church  at  about  the  same  rate  as  religious  believers  in 
West  European  countries.  In  the  1990s,  politicians  have  eagerly 
sought  the  opinion  of  the  church  on  most  important  issues, 
and  in  1996  even  the  communist  presidential  candidate,  Gen- 
nadiy  Zyuganov,  made  an  appearance  with  Patriarch  Aleksiy  II 
an  important  element  of  his  campaign. 

Other  religious  groups  also  have  enjoyed  relative  freedom  in 
the  post-Soviet  period,  with  some  limitations.  Mainstream  Prot- 
estant, Roman  Catholic,  and  Muslim  groups  are  fully  accepted 
by  the  state  and  the  Orthodox  Church,  but  the  Orthodox  hier- 
archy often  has  used  its  dominant  position  to  discourage  or 
block  the  activities  of  their  congregations.  The  new  freedom  of 
the  Gorbachev  era  brought  a  wave  of  Western  evangelical 
groups  whose  proselytizing  the  Orthodox  hierarchy  viewed 
with  alarm  and  hostility.  In  mid-1996  the  State  Duma  passed 
legislation  establishing  a  state  committee  to  monitor  the  activ- 
ity of  such  groups.  The  law  was  introduced  by  nationalist  allies 
of  the  Orthodox  Church  and  opposed  by  democratic  factions 
as  unconstitutional.  The  Jewish  community,  whose  religious 
and  cultural  activities  have  blossomed  in  Russia  in  the  1990s, 
still  experiences  subtle  forms  of  discrimination. 

The  problems  of  post-Soviet  Russia  also  are  based  directly  in 
economic  circumstances.  Some  of  the  reasons  for  Russia's 
uneven  progress  are  found  in  the  legacy  of  the  Soviet  era,  oth- 
ers in  post-Soviet  economic  policies.  For  the  majority  of  Rus- 
sian citizens,  the  ballyhooed  economic  reforms  of  the  1990s 
did  not  improve  the  quality  of  life;  indeed,  in  1996  the  "shock" 
of  Russia's  transition  to  a  free-enterprise  system  seemed  to  be 
intensifying  rather  than  subsiding,  as  unemployment  figures 
rose  and  more  Russians  slipped  below  the  official  poverty  line. 
In  the  first  half  of  1996,  the  number  of  registered  unemployed 
workers  increased  by  16  percent,  totaling  2.7  million — but  a 
much  higher  number  of  Russians  remained  unemployed  and 
failed  to  register  for  meager  state  benefits.  According  to  an  offi- 


lxv 


cial  report,  average  real  incomes  decreased  by  about  40  per- 
cent between  1991  and  October  1996. 

Russia's  society  has  become  increasingly  divided  according 
to  economic  categories.  As  the  majority  of  Russian  citizens 
struggle  to  remain  above  the  poverty  line,  a  small  minority 
have  prospered  through  high-risk  economic  ventures  that 
often  involve  connections  with  the  mafiya,  Russia's  pervasive 
network  of  organized  criminal  organizations.  Members  of  the 
successful  minority  increasingly  are  distinguished  from  the 
majority  of  society  by  conspicuous  consumption,  which  has 
engendered  strong  feelings  of  resentment.  Another  type  of 
post-Soviet  success  story  is  demonstrated  by  former  members 
of  the  Soviet  official  elite,  the  nomenklatura,  who  have  used 
Soviet-era  connections  to  gain  access  to  financial  resources  and 
influential  enterprise  positions  in  the  new  system.  By  1997 
experts  had  identified  a  new  oligarchy — the  post-Soviet  entre- 
preneurs who  have  built  personal  empires  and  strong  ties  with 
the  government  at  the  expense  of  their  fellow  Russians.  Rus- 
sian society  also  is  increasingly  divided  by  generations.  Older 
Russians  have  found  adapting  to  the  complexities  and  chal- 
lenges of  post-Soviet  society  much  more  difficult  than  have 
their  younger  compatriots,  so  the  former  often  preserve  as 
much  as  possible  of  their  former  lives,  garnished  with  nostalgia 
for  an  idealized  Soviet  past 

Moscow  has  become  the  center  of  Russia's  economic  activity, 
both  personal  and  corporate,  far  outstripping  St.  Petersburg, 
which  in  the  Soviet  era  was  the  more  cosmopolitan  city.  Many 
foreign  investors  have  concentrated  their  activity  in  Moscow, 
where  all  of  Russia's  large  banks  are  headquartered  and  where 
the  energetic  Mayor  Yuriy  Luzhkov  has  fostered  rapid  commer- 
cial expansion  with  active  government  participation.  Mean- 
while, the  luxurious  life  of  the  new  Moscow  upper  class  has 
spread  very  little  to  the  hinterlands. 

The  increasing  availability  of  land  and  materials  has  enabled 
some  individuals  to  escape  dependency  on  the  old  housing 
subsidy  system  (which  nevertheless  remained  active  in  1997). 
In  the  transition  to  a  fully  privatized  housing  system  that  began 
in  1992,  the  scarcity  of  resources  and  high  inflation  drove  pri- 
vate housing  prices  beyond  the  reach  of  most  Russians;  in  the 
mid-1990s,  the  slow,  uneven  progress  of  housing  reform  meant 
the  continued  existence  of  long  waiting  lists  and  very  crowded 
housing  conditions,  especially  in  the  cities.

The  Soviet  and  Russian  economies  have  been  supported  by 
one  of  the  richest  supplies  of  natural  resources  in  the  world. 
Fuels,  minerals,  timber,  and  a  well-educated  labor  force  always 
have  been  strong  principal  assets  of  industry.  But  the  location 
of  Russia's  raw  materials  often  has  presented  a  transportation 
problem.  As  the  industrial  centers  of  European  Russia  used  up 
nearby  fuels  and  other  resources,  the  more  distant  supplies  of 
Siberia  have  become  critical  but  expensive  alternatives.  The 
sheer  volume  of  available  raw  materials  encouraged  tremen- 
dous waste  in  the  Soviet  system;  central  planning  took  into 
account  neither  the  possibility  of  running  out  of  materials  nor 
the  grave  environmental  damage  caused  by  uncontrolled 
exploitation. 

Economic  policy  in  the  Soviet  Union  was  the  exclusive 
domain  of  planners  in  the  central  government,  whose  quotas 
and  distribution  decisions  ruled  virtually  all  economic  activity 
in  Russia  and  the  other  Soviet  republics.  Resource  apportion- 
ment in  that  system  favored  heavy  industry  and  the  military- 
industrial  complex  at  the  expense  of  consumer  production, 
token  revival  of  which  was  attempted  sporadically  beginning 
with  the  regime  of  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  (in  office  1953-64). 
The  services  sector  remained  underdeveloped,  and  agricul- 
tural production  policy  precluded  private  landownership  and 
relied  almost  entirely  on  collective  farms  (see  Glossary)  and 
state  farms  (see  Glossary).  Central  allocation  of  resources  and 
price  establishment  created  an  inflexible  economic  system 
whose  production  and  consumption  sides  had  no  relation  to 
each  other.  The  basic  unit  of  planning,  the  five-year  plan  (see 
Glossary),  set  long-term  goals  whose  basis  in  real  economic 
conditions  often  was  nonexistent  by  the  end  of  the  period.  The 
Soviet  planning  system  also  produced  a  substantial  class  of  state 
bureaucrats,  many  of  whom  preserved  their  influential  and 
highly  profitable  positions  in  state  enterprises  (and  hence  their 
stubborn  opposition  to  economic  reform)  well  into  the  post- 
Soviet  era. 

The  Soviet  state  also  had  full  control  of  foreign  trade.  The 
vast  majority  of  Russia's  overseas  commercial  activity  was  con- 
ducted with  the  nations  of  the  Community  for  Mutual  Eco- 
nomic Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glossary),  all  of  which 
followed  the  Soviet  model  of  the  centrally  planned  economy, 
and  all  of  which  were  governed  by  Comecon's  artificial  system 
for  allocation  of  production  responsibilities.  This  closed  com- 
mercial system  included  a  high  percentage  of  barter  arrange- 


lxvii 


ments.  The  system  was  supplemented  by  equally  regimented 
commercial  links  among  the  republics  of  the  Soviet  Union.  An 
important  result  was  that  Russian  products  were  exposed  to 
very  little  genuine  competition  in  world  markets,  despite  peri- 
odic efforts  to  cultivate  commercial  relationships  outside 
Comecon. 

By  1980  the  Soviet  economy  had  entered  a  decline  from 
which  it  never  was  to  emerge.  It  became  obvious  that  the  strong 
central  controls  that  traditionally  guided  economic  develop- 
ment had  failed  to  promote  the  creativity  and  productivity 
urgently  needed  in  a  highly  developed,  modern  economy.  As 
one  of  the  two  world  superpowers,  the  Soviet  Union  was  acutely 
conscious  that  the  West,  and  especially  the  United  States,  was 
bypassing  it  in  many  areas  outside  the  military  field.  So,  begin- 
ning in  the  mid-1980s,  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in 
office  1985-91)  experimented  with  unprecedented  economic 
reforms,  including  limited  application  of  free-market  princi- 
ples, in  a  policy  called  perestroika  (rebuilding — see  Glossary). 
However,  the  Gorbachev  concessions  were  too  small  and  too 
late,  so  the  system's  inherent  flaws  remained.  The  standard  of 
living  and  productivity  both  continued  to  fall  until  the  Soviet 
Union  dissolved  and  central  planning  was  discredited  in  1991. 

As  president  of  the  Russian  Republic,  Boris  Yeltsin  already 
had  advocated  substantial  economic  reform  prior  to  Russia's 
independence,  in  order  to  begin  resurrecting  Russia's  econ- 
omy from  the  crisis  of  the  last  Soviet  years.  For  the  new  Russian 
Federation,  the  Yeltsin  administration  set  ambitious  economic 
reform  goals  in  1992:  strict  limitation  of  government  spending 
to  cut  inflation;  redirection  of  state  investment  from  the  mili- 
tary-industrial complex  and  heavy  industry  toward  consumer 
production;  a  new  tax  system  to  redistribute  financial  resources 
to  more  efficient  sectors;  cutting  of  government  subsidies  for 
enterprises  and  eliminating  government  price  controls;  and 
lifting  of  government  control  of  foreign  trade.  Privatization  of 
the  major  sectors  of  production,  still  virtually  state  monopolies 
in  1991,  was  another  primary  goal. 

In  1992  worsening  economic  conditions  brought  a  confron- 
tation with  the  Supreme  Soviet  (legislature)  over  economic 
policy.  The  clash  forced  Yeltsin's  dismissal  of  reform  Prime 
Minister  Yegor  Gaydar  and  a  general  modification  of  reform 
goals  under  Gaydar' s  pragmatic  successor,  Viktor  Chernomyr- 
din. At  that  point,  failing  enterprises  still  received  easy  credit 
from  the  banking  system  and  from  other  enterprises — a  contin- 


lxviii 


uation  of  Soviet-style  fiscal  management  and  a  crucial  flaw  that 
began  to  be  corrected  only  in  1995. 

Many  of  the  goals  of  the  Yeltsin  program  were  met  at  least 
partially  in  the  first  five  post-Soviet  years,  depending  on  which 
statistics  are  used  to  define  economic  trends.  Foreign  trade  has 
been  liberalized  significantly,  and  the  list  of  Russia's  trading 
partners  now  is  dominated  by  West  European  rather  than  East 
European  and  former  Soviet  countries.  The  course  of  foreign 
investment  has  been  uneven.  Although  Western  and  Japanese 
firms  have  shown  great  interest  in  joint  ventures  with  Russian 
enterprises,  Russia's  unfinished  and  uncertain  commercial  and 
legal  infrastructure  has  limited  foreign  participation,  and  pro- 
tectionist laws  restrict  foreign  activity  in  industries  such  as  com- 
munications and  automobiles.  International  lenders  such  as 
the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary),  the 
Paris  Club  of  Western  government  lenders,  and  the  London 
Club  of  international  commercial  banks  have  provided  sub- 
stantial aid,  with  the  caveat  that  Russia  must  improve  economic 
indicators  such  as  its  inflation  rate  and  budget  deficits.  In  1993 
and  1994,  soaring  inflation  and  government  deregulation  of 
prices  robbed  consumers  of  much  of  their  purchasing  power 
before  a  government  tight-money  policy  brought  inflation 
under  control  in  1995  and  1996.  In  December  1996,  prices  rose 
by  1.4  percent,  although  wage  arrears  made  that  figure  irrele- 
vant for  many  Russians. 

The  Yeltsin  privatization  program  began  with  small  enter- 
prises, a  large  proportion  of  which  were  in  private  hands  by 
1995.  Sales  of  larger  enterprises,  accomplished  in  several 
phases,  encountered  substantial  difficulties,  however.  In  1995 
allegations  of  corruption  slowed  the  process,  as  did  persistent 
opposition  from  the  antireform  State  Duma  factions.  Privatiza- 
tion was  virtually  halted  during  the  1996  presidential  election 
campaign,  but  in  July  1996  the  administration  announced  new 
goals  and  a  reformed  system  for  ownership  transition.  Initially 
positive,  Western  evaluations  of  Russia's  privatization  program 
were  tempered  in  1996  by  continued  government  favoritism 
toward  former  state  enterprises,  by  the  sale  of  investment 
shares  to  banks  and  other  institutions  with  close  state  connec- 
tions rather  than  to  the  public,  and  by  the  program's  distinct 
slowdown  in  1996.  In  October  1996,  the  government  had  col- 
lected only  14  percent  of  the  year's  targeted  privatization  reve- 
nue of  US$2.2  billion.  In  November  the  planned  public  sale  of 
stock  in  two  major  state-owned  telecommunications  firms,  Ros- 


lxix 


telekom  and  Svyazinvest,  was  canceled  in  favor  of  stock  sales  to 
two  large  banks  that  had  financed  Yeltsin's  1996  campaign,  her- 
alding a  new  privatization  scandal.  The  1997  national  budget 
set  a  privatization  income  goal  for  1997  at  US$1.1  billion,  but 
already  in  February  Vladimir  Potanin,  head  of  the  privatization 
revenue  collection  commission,  expressed  doubt  that  the  goal 
could  be  met. 

Tax  collection  remained  a  major  problem  for  Russia  as  of 
early  1997.  Although  some  nominal  tax  reforms  were  put  in 
place,  tax  collection  remained  inept,  and  the  system  still  failed 
to  promote  private  initiative  or  foreign  investment.  Despite 
constant  government  pleas,  promises,  and  reform  blueprints, 
and  despite  substantial  pressure  from  the  IMF,  in  1997  taxation 
remained  the  main  obstacle  to  budgetary  solvency. 

The  government  lost  large  amounts  of  tax  revenue  because 
unofficial  and  illegal  commerce  is  widespread  and  because  the 
State  Taxation  Service  inspires  so  little  respect  from  legitimate 
businesses.  According  to  an  official  1996  estimate,  only  16  per- 
cent of  Russia's  2.6  million  firms  were  paying  taxes  regularly, 
and  at  least  twice  that  number  paid  no  taxes  at  all.  On  three  dif- 
ferent occasions,  the  IMF  postponed  installments  of  a  US$10.1 
billion  loan  to  Russia  because  of  the  taxation  problem — twice 
in  the  second  half  of  1996  and  again  in  February  1997. 

When  the  official  tax  shortfall  reached  US$24.4  billion  in 
October  1996,  the  government  began  televising  appeals  for  tax- 
law  compliance.  A  new  emergency  tax  commission,  headed  by 
Prime  Minister  Chernomyrdin  and  Chief  of  Staff  Anatoliy  Chu- 
bays,  targeted  seventeen  of  Russia's  largest  companies  for  bank- 
ruptcy  proceedings  if  their  huge  tax  arrears  were  not  paid 
immediately.  Among  the  most  delinquent  enterprises  were 
three  subsidiaries  of  Chernomyrdin's  extremely  wealthy  former 
company,  the  State  National  Gas  Company  (Gazprom),  which 
reportedly  owed  US$2.1  billion.  Many  large  enterprises  failed 
to  comply,  and  much  of  Russia's  extensive  so-called  shadow 
economy  remained  beyond  the  reach  of  the  commission.  Crit- 
ics characterized  the  emergency  commission  as  a  stopgap  tactic 
that  delayed  fundamental  reform  in  the  tax  system.  According 
to  government  statistics,  in  1996  some  20,000  collection  orders 
were  issued  for  back  taxes  amounting  to  US$15.7  billion;  the 
orders  yielded  only  US$3.8  billion  to  the  state  budget.  Early  in 
1997,  Minister  of  Finance  Aleksandr  Livshits  drafted  a  new  tax 
code  that  would  have  saved  the  government  an  estimated 
US$30  billion  annually.  But  the  plan's  anticipated  closing  of 


lxx 


profitable  loopholes  attracted  sharp  resistance.  In  February 
1997,  Minister  of  Internal  Affairs  Anatoliy  Kulikov,  known  as  a 
hard-liner,  was  given  the  task  of  cracking  down  on  tax  violators. 
Yeltsin  removed  Livshits  from  his  position  during  the  Govern- 
ment reorganization  of  March  1997. 

In  March  the  Government  threatened  bankruptcy  proceed- 
ings against  a  new  group  of  ninety  nonpaying  enterprises, 
many  of  them  quite  large,  hoping  to  encourage  public  sales  of 
shares  that  would  dislodge  Soviet-era  managers  in  favor  of  out- 
side investors.  At  the  same  time,  privatization  chief  Al'fred 
Kokh  was  given  control  of  the  inept  State  Taxation  Service. 

Besides  the  chronic  tax  collection  failure,  institutional 
remains  of  the  Soviet  era  also  continue  to  plague  economic 
progress.  In  many  large  plants,  the  economic  reforms  of  the 
early  1990s  left  control  with  the  same  managers  who  had  run 
the  plants  for  the  state.  In  the  post-Soviet  years,  managers  have 
taken  advantage  of  Russia's  new  free-market  atmosphere,  and 
the  lack  of  effective  commercial  legislation,  to  line  their  own 
pockets — often  in  cooperation  with  criminal  organizations — 
while  paying  little  attention  to  plant  productivity.  In  1996  the 
Government  increased  subsidies  to  some  major  automobile 
and  defense  plants,  reversing  the  direction  of  privatization  and 
further  diminishing  incentives. 

Another  obstacle  to  economic  stability  is  the  pervasive  influ- 
ence on  economic  activity  of  the  mafiya — as  commonly  used  in 
Russia,  a  term  including  gangsters,  dishonest  businesspeople, 
and  corrupt  officials.  In  the  1990s,  Russia  is  suffering  the 
effects  of  an  increasingly  prosperous  national  network  of  crimi- 
nals who  extort  protection  money  from  an  estimated  75  per- 
cent of  businesses  and  banks.  Individuals  refusing  such 
payments  often  are  the  victims  of  violent  crimes.  In  1995  gangs 
controlled  an  estimated  50,000  private  and  state  enterprises 
and  had  full  ownership  of  thousands  more.  Unlike  organized 
criminal  groups  in  the  West,  which  specialize  in  illegal  activity 
such  as  drug  trafficking  and  prostitution,  Russia's  mafiya  spans 
the  entire  range  of  the  economy,  discouraging  private  enter- 
prise and  siphoning  off  10  to  20  percent  of  enterprise  profits 
that  are  neither  taxed  nor  reinvested  in  legitimate  business. 
Organized  crime  also  has  been  involved  in  the  movement  of  a 
huge  amount  of  capital — estimated  at  US$1  to  US$2  billion  per 
month — out  of  Russia  in  the  mid-1990s.  Such  activity  has  pros- 
pered mainly  because  of  strong  links  with  corrupt  officials;  an 


lxxi 


estimated  30  to  50  percent  of  organized  crime's  proceeds  is 
spent  on  bribes  to  procurators,  police,  and  bureaucrats. 

This  connection  is  not  new  in  the  post-Soviet  era;  already  in 
the  Brezhnev  era,  officials  took  bribes  from  the  underworld  as 
the  black  market  responded  to  gaps  in  Soviet  production.  In 
the  early  post-Soviet  years,  reformers  implicitly  condoned  such 
activity  in  the  hope  that  it  would  hasten  the  development  of  a 
legitimate  private-enterprise  sector.  In  1993,  however,  govern- 
ment measures  against  criminals  were  stimulated  by  publicity 
about  Russia's  crime  wave  and  by  the  success  of  ultranationalist 
political  groups  who  stressed  the  crime  issue.  Many  of  the 
Yeltsin  administration's  law  enforcement  decrees  of  1993  and 
1994  were  of  questionable  constitutionality,  and  they  have  had 
little  overall  effect  in  the  mid-1990s  because  law  enforcement 
agencies  remain  corrupt. 

As  Russia  has  attempted  to  meet  the  standards  for  inflation 
and  budget  deficits  set  by  international  lenders,  a  key  element 
has  been  limiting  the  money  supply,  which  was  poorly  con- 
trolled until  1995.  The  more  stringent  policies  established  that 
year  brought  loud  complaints  from  regional  governments,  an 
increase  in  noncurrency  payments  that  hampered  the  collec- 
tion of  state  revenue,  and  continued  wage  arrears  in  state  and 
private  enterprises  suffering  cash  shortages.  Although  the 
annual  inflation  rate  for  1996  was  22  percent,  compared  with 
131  percent  in  1995,  authorities  in  the  Government  and  else- 
where blamed  a  new  economic  downturn  on  the  tight-money 
policy  because  private  enterprises  lacked  capital  with  which  to 
expand  their  operations. 

The  1997  monetary  plan  of  the  Russian  Central  Bank  (RCB) 
called  for  increasing  the  money  supply  by  22  to  30  percent  dur- 
ing that  year,  a  level  not  projected  to  raise  inflation  above  the 
12  percent  annual  increase  forecast  by  the  1997  national  bud- 
get. At  the  end  of  1996,  the  RCB  planned  for  a  ruble  deprecia- 
tion of  9  percent  during  1997,  which  would  maintain  the 
exchange  rate  at  between  5,750  and  6,350  rubles  per  United 
States  dollar  at  the  end  of  the  year.  During  1996  the  exchange 
rate  moved  from  4,640  rubles  to  the  dollar  to  5,560,  an 
increase  of  nearly  20  percent. 

A  Government  goal  for  1997  was  reducing  the  interest  rate 
for  domestic  bank  loans  to  20  or  25  percent  to  provide  working 
capital  for  stagnant  enterprises  and  limit  the  haphazard, 
uncontrolled  interenterprise  loans  and  in-kind  payments  that 
had  proliferated  as  capital  became  scarce.  However,  shares  in 


lxxii 


most  enterprises  remained  unavailable  to  the  general  public, 
and  the  high-interest  bonds  sold  by  the  Government  in  1996 
had  attracted  large  amounts  of  bank  capital  away  from  more 
risky  investment  in  private  ventures. 

The  Government's  draft  1997  budget,  which  had  been 
revised  by  a  conciliation  commission  of  legislators  and  Govern- 
ment representatives,  was  approved  by  the  State  Duma  in  Janu- 
ary after  the  four  readings  required  by  law.  After  the  first  two 
drafts  were  rejected,  the  Government  added  about  US$6  bil- 
lion in  spending  and  new  tax  breaks  to  stimulate  economic 
activity.  The  changes  swung  the  votes  of  the  Communist  Party 
of  the  Russian  Federation  (Kommunisticheskaya  partiya 
Rossiyskoy  Federatsii — KPRF)  and  its  allies,  who  had  lobbied 
for  additional  government  spending,  but  democratic  parties 
such  as  Yabloko  voted  against  the  budget  because  of  inade- 
quate fiscal  restraint.  The  Federation  Council  (the  upper 
house  of  the  parliament)  approved  the  budget  but  expressed 
serious  doubts  about  the  realism  of  its  revenue  projections. 

As  approved,  the  budget  was  based  on  projections  of  11.8 
percent  annual  inflation  and  GDP  growth  of  2  percent  for 
1997.  The  planned  budget  deficit  of  about  US$16.5  billion 
would  be  3.5  percent  of  the  projected  GDP  figure.  However, 
Russian  and  Western  experts,  including  Russia's  minister  of 
economics,  Yevgeniy  Yasin,  called  the  GDP  projection  greatly 
exaggerated.  Yasin's  ministry  forecast  zero  GDP  growth  for 
1997,  with  recovery  beginning  in  1998  at  the  earliest.  The  bud- 
get did  not  include  a  10  percent  increase  in  Russia's  minimum 
wage  that  went  into  effect  in  January  1997  and  that  would 
entail  additional  state  spending.  In  1996  the  government's 
issue  of  bonds  with  interest  rates  exceeding  100  percent  had 
complicated  the  budget-balancing  process  by  tripling  the  gov- 
ernment borrowing  of  1995  and  inflating  the  public  debt  from 
16  to  26  percent  of  GDP. 

Economic  indicators  for  the  first  half  of  1996  were  mostly 
negative.  According  to  an  independent  Russian  survey,  com- 
pared with  December  1995  the  real  volume  of  production  and 
services  dropped  by  11  percent,  the  number  of  employed  per- 
sons dropped  by  4  percent,  the  real  volume  of  capital  invest- 
ment dropped  by  54  percent,  the  average  prices  of 
manufactured  products  and  purchased  products  rose  by  14 
percent  and  25  percent,  respectively,  and  the  average  wage  rose 
by  10  percent.  In  the  first  nine  months  of  1996,  total  GDP 
dropped  by  6  percent,  and  industrial  output  dropped  by  5  per- 


lxxiii 


cent  compared  with  the  same  period  in  1995.  Light  industry, 
construction  materials,  and  machine  building  showed  the 
sharpest  drops  in  production,  and  domestic  investment 
declined  by  17  percent. 

In  the  first  nine  months  of  1996,  agricultural  production 
dropped  by  8  percent.  Russia's  1996  grain  harvest  was  69  mil- 
lion tons,  one  of  the  smallest  in  the  last  thirty  years  and  only  a  9 
percent  improvement  over  the  disastrously  low  harvest  of  1995. 
An  estimated  three-quarters  of  farms  lost  money,  and  only  two- 
thirds  of  1996  budget  allotments  for  farm  support  were  paid 
out.  As  of  early  1997,  the  restructuring  of  the  agricultural  sys- 
tem was  one  of  the  major  unfulfilled  promises  of  Yeltsin's  presi- 
dency. 

Russia's  foreign  trade  position  did  not  improve  significantly 
in  1996.  Membership  in  the  World  Trade  Organization 
(WTO — see  Glossary),  a  top  priority  for  acceptance  in  the 
international  free  market,  continued  to  be  delayed.  Although 
some  aspects  of  Russia's  trade  policy  have  been  liberalized  sub- 
stantially, the  WTO  cited  continuing  price  controls  on  oil,  state 
subsidies  to  major  industries,  protective  import  duties,  and 
abrupt  changes  in  tariff  and  tax  policies  for  foreign  companies 
as  defects  that  precluded  Russia's  membership.  According  to 
the  WTO,  stability  and  transparency  were  the  major  missing 
elements  in  Russia's  trade  policy.  Although  the  United  States 
pledged  support  for  Russia's  admittance  in  1998,  prospects 
were  unclear  in  early  1997. 

Foreign  investment  for  1996  was  forecast  to  reach  only 
slightly  more  than  half  the  1995  figure  (US$1.5  billion),  mainly 
because  of  continuing  uncertainty  in  Russia's  standards  for  tax- 
ation, accounting,  and  property  rights.  In  October  1996,  an 
international  market  consulting  firm  placed  Russia  below  Bra- 
zil, Indonesia,  Mexico,  and  Venezuela  in  desirability  as  an 
emerging  market  opportunity  for  investors.  Corruption,  fraud, 
and  bureaucratic  delays  were  cited  as  the  main  factors  in  that 
ranking.  In  November  the  failure  of  a  Russian  space  mission  to 
Mars  lost  foreign  investors  about  US$180  million,  as  well  as 
damaging  the  stature  of  a  key  remaining  high-technology 
industry.  In  April  the  space  program  suffered  further  damage 
with  the  delay  of  the  new  Russia-United  States  International 
Space  Station  because  the  Government  had  not  funded  a  criti- 
cal aerospace  contractor. 

On  the  positive  side,  in  October  foreign  investors  paid 
nearly  US$450  million  for  shares  in  Gazprom,  the  natural  gas 


lxxiv 


monopoly.  About  forty  joint  ventures  were  active  in  the  oil 
industry  in  1996,  accounting  for  about  8  percent  of  Russia's 
total  extraction.  Foreign  investment  in  Russia's  extraction 
industries  was  expected  to  expand  significantly  beginning  in 
1997  as  the  State  Duma  expedited  approval  of  the  production- 
sharing  agreements  that  are  the  basis  of  foreign  participation. 

In  November  1996,  Russia  issued  its  first  set  of  bonds  on  the 
European  market  after  receiving  an  unexpectedly  high  bond 
rating  from  Western  credit  agencies.  Following  Russia's  first 
bond  rating  since  1917,  the  bonds  drew  US$1  billion  from 
United  States,  European,  and  South  Korean  investors  attracted 
by  the  9.25  percent  interest  rate.  A  place  in  the  bond  market 
was  expected  to  help  Russia  raise  money  from  other  interna- 
tional sources.  In  March  1997,  the  issue  of  a  second  set  of 
bonds,  this  time  denominated  in  German  marks,  fetched 
US$1.2  billion.  A  third  issue  was  planned  for  later  in  1997;  like 
the  second,  it  was  designated  to  pay  overdue  pensions  and  sala- 
ries. 

In  late  1996  and  early  1997,  labor  groups  showed  some  signs 
of  ending  their  remarkably  passive  reaction  to  the  chronic 
wage  arrears  in  many  of  Russia's  industries.  (In  March  1997, 
the  total  wage  debt  was  estimated  at  US$8.5  billion.)  Through 
most  of  1996,  with  a  few  notable  exceptions  such  as  the  coal 
workers,  labor  in  Russia  followed  the  Soviet  pattern  of  expect- 
ing the  government  rather  than  enterprise  managers  to  rem- 
edy their  plight. 

The  older  trade  unions,  many  of  whose  leaders  had  been 
hand-picked  by  plant  managers  in  the  Soviet  era,  generally  dis- 
couraged strong  actions  against  employers  in  the  early  and 
mid-1990s.  Unions  formed  after  1985  suffered  from  Russia's 
total  lack  of  labor  legislation,  which  allowed  the  government 
and  enterprise  officials  to  ignore  union  claims  on  behalf  of  the 
workers.  Experts  pointed  to  the  lack  of  pressure  from  a  united 
labor  movement  as  a  key  reason  the  Yeltsin  government  failed 
to  address  the  problem  of  overdue  wages. 

In  the  second  half  of  1996,  strike  activity  intensified  some- 
what. According  to  government  statistics,  356,000  workers  at 
more  than  3,700  enterprises  participated  in  strikes  in  the  first 
nine  months  of  1996,  with  the  largest  number  of  strikes  in  edu- 
cational institutions  and  coal  mines.  (Doctors,  miners,  nurses, 
and  teachers  were  the  workers  hardest  hit  by  wage  arrears.) 

In  November  1996  and  March  1997,  nationwide  strikes  and 
demonstrations  called  by  the  Federation  of  Independent  Trade 


lxxv 


Unions  of  Russia  (Federatsiya  nezavisimikh  profsoyuzov 
Rossii — FNPR),  the  largest  such  organization  in  the  country, 
failed  to  galvanize  widespread  support.  In  the  March  action,  an 
estimated  2  million  workers  struck  or  demonstrated,  but  more 
than  80  percent  of  those  were  teachers,  and  the  FNPR  had  pre- 
dicted substantially  heavier  participation.  Observers  attributed 
the  low  turnout  to  apathy,  lack  of  trust  in  the  FNPR,  and  the 
expectation  that  Yeltsin's  recent  government  reorganization 
would  improve  the  situation. 

The  democratization  of  the  political  system  has  followed  an 
equally  bumpy  path  in  Russia's  first  post-Soviet  years.  As  with 
economic  reform,  some  elements  of  political  reform  appeared 
under  Gorbachev  in  the  late  1980s.  The  policy  of  glasnost 
allowed  public  discussion  of  hitherto  taboo  subjects,  including 
the  wisdom  of  government  economic  policy  in  a  time  of  serious 
economic  decline.  As  the  Soviet  Union's  regional  jurisdictions 
clamored  for  various  degrees  of  sovereignty,  Boris  Yeltsin  led 
Russia's  challenge  to  Soviet  authority  in  a  number  of  areas.  In 
1991  Russians  elected  Yeltsin  president  of  their  republic  in  a 
free  election;  the  coup  against  Gorbachev  in  August  1991  made 
Yeltsin  the  most  powerful  man  in  Russia,  which  shortly  became 
an  independent  state. 

From  the  very  beginning,  Yeltsin's  attempts  to  promulgate 
reform  programs  from  the  office  of  the  presidency  encoun- 
tered stiff  opposition  from  antireform  factions  in  the  legislative 
branch.  Beginning  in  1994,  that  opposition  was  centered  in  the 
State  Duma.  After  Yeltsin  used  military  force  to  overcome  an 
open  rebellion  against  his  dismissal  of  the  parliament  in  Octo- 
ber 1993,  he  achieved  passage  of  a  new  constitution  that  pre- 
scribed a  strong  executive  and  reduced  the  powers  of  the 
legislative  branch.  However,  the  first  two  legislative  elections,  in 
1993  and  1995,  seated  large  numbers  of  deputies  from  the 
KPRF,  the  Liberal-Democratic  Party  of  Russia  (Liberal'no- 
demokraticheskaya  partiya  Rossii — LDPR),  and  other  national- 
ist and  antireform  groups.  Under  worsening  economic  condi- 
tions, a  seemingly  unstoppable  crime  wave,  and  a  highly 
unpopular  war  in  Chechnya,  Yeltsin's  popularity  plummeted  in 
1995  and  early  1996.  His  response  was  a  contradictory  series  of 
personnel  and  agency  shifts  at  top  government  levels,  together 
with  presidential  decrees  that  often  reversed  the  movement 
toward  democratic  governance.  By  early  1996,  virtually  all 
reformist  officials  had  been  removed  from  positions  of  influ- 
ence, and  a  group  of  hard-liners,  led  by  presidential  security 


lxxvi 


chief  Aleksandr  Korzhakov,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Oleg  Sos- 
kovets, and  Minister  of  Internal  Affairs  Anatoliy  Kulikov,  seem- 
ingly had  the  president's  ear. 

By  that  time,  Yeltsin's  authoritarian  use  of  executive  power 
had  combined  with  the  Chechnya  imbroglio  to  lose  him  the 
support  of  the  democratic  and  reformist  factions  that  had  been 
active  promoters  of  early  reform  policies.  As  he  engaged  in  an 
uphill  presidential  campaign,  Yeltsin  made  lavish  promises  of 
government  aid  to  unemployed  workers  and  state  enterprises, 
and  allegations  of  corruption  in  the  latest  phase  of  the  privati- 
zation program  forced  him  to  remain  silent  about  that  aspect 
of  his  administration. 

The  1996  presidential  campaign  yielded  two  distinctly 
opposed  theories  of  governance:  the  KPRF's  frank  appeal  for 
return  to  the  central  rule  of  Soviet  days  and  Yeltsin's  sometimes 
timid  commitment  to  democratization  and  economic  reform. 
In  general,  however,  the  national  party  system  remained  quite 
fluid.  Although  a  large  number  of  parties  with  national  constit- 
uencies emerged,  much  shifting  occurred  among  the  smaller 
parties  as  coalitions  formed  and  dissolved.  Some  forty-three 
parties  and  coalitions  registered  for  the  1995  legislative  elec- 
tions. In  1995  Yeltsin  attempted  to  dominate  party  politics  by 
forming  two  nominally  opposed  parties  with  essentially  pro- 
administration  positions,  but  his  strategy  was  unsuccessful.  The 
one  major  party  that  emerged  from  his  manipulations,  Our 
Home  Is  Russia,  captured  relatively  few  seats  in  the  State  Duma 
in  1995  but  retained  national  standing  as  a  major  party  because 
of  its  identification  with  Chernomyrdin. 

Of  the  proreform  opposition  groups,  the  Yabloko  coalition 
remained  the  strongest  in  1996,  but  its  influence  was  limited 
because  it  refused  to  join  forces  with  other  reform  parties.  The 
candidates  of  Yabloko  and  other  reformist  groups  fared  poorly 
in  the  first  round  of  the  1996  presidential  election.  Meanwhile, 
the  KPRF  had  developed  a  unified  and  loyal  following  among 
Russians  disillusioned  with  Yeltsin  and  nostalgic  for  the  Soviet 
past. 

As  the  presidential  campaign  developed,  the  KPRF  candi- 
date, former  CPSU  functionary  Gennadiy  Zyuganov,  emerged 
as  the  prime  competitor  of  Yeltsin.  The  president  used  his 
access  to  broadcast  and  print  media  (which  feared  the  repres- 
sion that  would  result  from  a  KPRF  victory)  to  climb  steadily  in 
the  polls.  In  the  first  round,  Yeltsin  defeated  Zyuganov  nar- 
rowly. Before  the  second-round  faceoff  with  Zyuganov,  Yeltsin 


lxxvii 


dismissed  the  most  visible  hard-liners  in  his  administration, 
added  popular  third-place  finisher  Aleksandr  Lebed'  to  his 
administration,  and  coaxed  lukewarm  endorsements  from 
Yabloko  and  other  reformist  parties. 

In  the  second  round,  Yeltsin  easily  defeated  Zyuganov,  a  dull 
campaigner  who  could  not  convince  undecided  voters  that  a 
KPRF  victory  would  not  mean  a  return  to  the  days  of  Soviet 
repression.  In  what  amounted  to  a  contest  between  anti-Yeltsin 
and  anticommunist  sides,  Yeltsin  attracted  an  estimated  17  mil- 
lion voters  who  had  voted  for  Lebed'  or  Yabloko  candidate 
Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy  in  the  first  round,  and  for  whom  Yeltsin  now 
was  the  lesser  of  two  evils. 

To  gain  acceptance  as  the  main  opposition  faction  at  the 
national  level,  after  the  presidential  election  the  KPRF 
attempted  to  broaden  its  constituency  by  forming  a  coalition 
called  the  National  Patriotic  Union  of  Russia.  The  coalition 
included  the  leftist  and  nationalist  groups  that  had  supported 
Zyuganov's  1996  presidential  bid.  To  improve  its  national 
image  from  one  of  disruption  to  one  of  constructive  coopera- 
tion, the  coalition  softened  its  antigovernment  rhetoric.  A 
prime  example  of  the  new  approach  was  KPRF  support  of  the 
Chernomyrdin  government's  draft  budget  in  the  State  Duma 
deliberations  of  December  1996-January  1997. 

The  KPRF  found  this  position  tenable  while  Yeltsin  was  ill 
and  the  moderate  Chernomyrdin  had  a  strong  position  in  the 
Government.  However,  the  Government  reorganization  of 
March  1997  gave  new  power  to  reformists  with  whom  the  KPRF 
shared  little  common  ground.  The  party  also  showed  signs  of  a 
split  between  moderates  and  radicals  who  rejected  compro- 
mise. Meanwhile,  young  Russians  showed  little  interest  in  join- 
ing the  KPRF,  which  offered  few  constructive  ideas  about 
Russia's  future  and  whose  membership  increasingly  was  based 
on  an  old  guard  of  Soviet-era  activists. 

Beginning  his  second  term,  Yeltsin  filled  his  new  cabinet 
with  individuals  with  reformist  credentials.  Free-market  advo- 
cate Aleksandr  Livshits  was  appointed  minister  of  finance,  and 
reformist  Yevgeniy  Yasin  retained  his  position  as  minister  of  the 
economy.  In  another  indication  that  economic  reform  would 
continue,  Yeltsin  named  reformist  Al'fred  Kokh  as  deputy 
prime  minister  for  privatization.  Retained  from  the  previous 
Government  were  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Yevgeniy  Prima- 
kov (a  1996  appointee),  recently  appointed  Minister  of 


lxxviii 


Defense  Igor*  Rodionov,  and  hard-line  Minister  of  Internal 
Affairs  Anatoliy  Kulikov. 

The  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  and  Natural 
Resources  was  redesignated  the  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources; 
environmental  issues  were  shifted  to  a  new,  subcabinet  agency, 
the  State  Environmental  Protection  Committee,  headed  by  Vik- 
tor Danilov-Danil'yan,  who  had  been  minister  of  environmental 
protection  and  natural  resources  in  the  first  Yeltsin  administra- 
tion. The  only  minister  affiliated  with  the  KPRF  was  Aman 
Tuleyev,  a  strong  proponent  of  reintegration  of  the  CIS  states, 
who  was  appointed  to  head  the  Ministry  of  CIS  Affairs. 

In  August  1996,  Chernomyrdin  listed  among  the  new  Gov- 
ernment's goals  a  dramatic  reduction  of  the  state  bureaucracy, 
including  the  elimination  of  twenty-four  ministries  and  agen- 
cies. However,  no  streamlining  occurred  until  March  1997, 
when  Yeltsin  dropped  three  of  his  deputy  prime  ministers  and 
announced  a  large-scale  Government  reorganization  as  a  rem- 
edy for  what  Yeltsin  admitted  was  poor  performance  by  his  sec- 
ond-term appointees.  The  new,  smaller  Government  was  to 
include  eight  deputy  prime  ministers  (compared  with  twelve 
previously),  twenty-three  ministries  (three  of  which  were 
headed  by  deputy  prime  ministers,  and  a  reduction  of  one 
from  the  previous  organization),  sixteen  state  committees 
(compared  with  seventeen  previously),  and  twenty  other  fede- 
ral agencies. 

A  key  appointment  in  this  period  was  Boris  Nemtsov  as  dep- 
uty prime  minister  in  charge  of  social  issues  (including  the  cri- 
sis of  wage  and  pension  arrears)  and  the  extremely  prob- 
lematic reform  of  state  monopolies  and  housing  subsidies.  As 
governor  of  Nizhniy  Novgorod  Oblast,  Nemtsov  had  gained 
international  recognition  for  his  brilliant  regional  economic 
reforms.  Nemtsov's  reputation  for  honesty  also  was  expected  to 
improve  the  tarnished  image  of  Yeltsin's  administration. 

The  Government  reorganization  process  required  much 
more  time  than  expected  because  factions  struggled  to  gain 
coveted  posts  and  no  qualified  persons  could  be  found  for  oth- 
ers. Reportedly  at  least  twelve  individuals  refused  appointments 
to  head  ministries  and  committees.  The  reorganization  also 
sharpened  the  power  struggle  between  the  Government  and 
the  State  Duma,  the  main  political  bastion  of  numerous  special 
interests  that  the  initiatives  of  Chubays  and  Nemtsov  promised 
to  attack,  and  whose  patron,  Chernomyrdin,  now  was  fading.

In  June  1996,  the  appointment  of  former  general  Aleksandr 
Lebed'  as  head  of  the  Security  Council  improved  the  prospects 
of  an  already  promising  political  figure.  In  this  position,  Lebed' 
remained  in  the  public  eye  by  making  controversial  speeches 
on  matters  of  policy  and  by  negotiating  what  turned  out  to  be 
the  conclusive  cease-fire  of  the  Chechen  conflict.  Lebed1  had  a 
base  of  avid  supporters  who  craved  charismatic,  assertive  lead- 
ership. Unlike  most  other  Russian  government  figures,  he  cre- 
ated a  positive  image  on  television,  which  by  1996  was  the  most 
important  source  of  news  for  most  Russians.  In  October  Yeltsin 
responded  to  continued  criticism  from  Lebed'  by  dismissing 
him  from  the  Security  Council.  In  the  months  that  followed  his 
dismissal,  Lebed'  polished  his  public  image  in  Russia  and 
abroad.  He  began  preparations  for  a  future  presidential  cam- 
paign by  seeking  funds  for  future  political  activities,  and  by 
traveling  to  the  United  States  and  Western  Europe.  Although 
he  virtually  disappeared  from  the  pro-Yeltsin  television  net- 
works after  his  dismissal,  in  early  1997  polls  indicated  that 
Lebed'  remained  the  most  popular  political  figure  in  Russia.  In 
March  he  established  a  new  opposition  party,  the  Russian  Peo- 
ple's Republican  Party,  which  he  described  as  an  alternative  to 
the  KPRF  and  the  ruling  elite. 

Early  in  Yeltsin's  second  term,  the  urgency  of  the  Chechnya 
conflict  receded  as  the  two  sides  negotiated  the  long-term  con- 
ditions of  the  so-called  Khasavyurt  accords  that  Lebed'  had 
achieved  in  August  1996.  The  cease-fire  was  met  with  great 
relief  by  the  Russian  people  as  the  end  of  a  long  ordeal,  and 
this  attitude  contributed  to  the  enduring  popularity  of  Lebed'. 
In  October  the  Khasavyurt  accords  survived  the  dismissal  of 
their  architect;  the  Chechens  reluctantly  continued  negotia- 
tions after  the  moderate  Ivan  Rybkin  was  named  to  replace 
Lebed'  as  Security  Council  chief  and  head  negotiator  on  the 
Russian  side.  In  November  Yeltsin  announced  the  withdrawal 
of  the  two  Russian  brigades  that  had  been  designated  for  per- 
manent occupation  of  Chechnya,  a  concession  upon  which 
Chechen  negotiators  had  adamantly  insisted.  By  February 
1997,  all  Russian  units  had  been  withdrawn.  After  six  Red  Cross 
workers  and  six  Russian  civilians  were  murdered — apparently 
by  renegade  guerrillas — near  Groznyy  in  December  1996,  all 
international  aid  organizations  except  for  the  Organization  for 
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE — see  Glossary) 
removed  their  personnel  from  Chechnya.  Unreconciled 
Chechen  guerrilla  groups  continued  kidnappings  in  1997, 


lxxx 


however,  and  the  resettlement  of  Russian  emigres  from  Chech- 
nya promised  to  strain  the  already  meager  resources  of  Russia's 
Federal  Migration  Service. 

In  late  1996,  Russia  took  an  increasingly  conciliatory  negoti- 
ating approach  with  the  Chechens,  offering  agreements  restor- 
ing trade,  communications,  customs  relations,  and  road  links 
and  resuming  oil  and  gas  refining  and  transport.  Russia's  best 
hope  of  keeping  Chechnya  in  the  federation  in  1997  was  eco- 
nomic leverage,  because  the  war  had  left  the  republic  deci- 
mated and  without  international  ties  and  because  the 
infrastructure  already  existed  for  Russia  to  restore  Chechnya's 
most  vital  industry,  oil  refining.  The  main  Russian  economic 
negotiator  was  Boris  Berezovskiy,  a  controversial  automotive 
and  banking  mogul  who  had  contributed  a  large  sum  to 
Yeltsin's  reelection  campaign. 

The  ultimate  status  of  Chechnya  and  the  payment  of  war 
reparations  remained  unresolved  in  early  1997.  The  Khasavyurt 
accords  called  for  a  five-year  waiting  period  before  deciding 
the  independence  issue,  but  Russia  insisted  that  the  territorial 
integrity  of  the  federation  must  not  be  threatened.  In  January 
1997,  Chechnya  conducted  its  first  presidential  and  legislative 
elections;  international  observers  described  the  election  proce- 
dure as  fair  and  open,  although  refugees  from  Chechnya, 
including  an  estimated  350,000  Russians,  were  not  permitted 
to  vote.  Russia's  foreign  policy  establishment  saw  Asian 
Maskhadov,  the  former  military  leader  who  easily  won  the  pres- 
idency, as  a  potential  partner  in  further  negotiations,  unlike 
the  more  radical  presidential  candidates.  However,  all  sixteen 
presidential  candidates  based  their  platforms  on  Chechnya's 
full  independence  under  the  name  "Republic  of  Chechnya-Ich- 
keria,"  and  Maskhadov  refused  to  take  his  rightful  seat  as  a 
republic  governor  in  Russia's  Federation  Council.  Russia's  offi- 
cial response  to  the  January  elections  was  muted;  by  March,  the 
terms  of  a  treaty  of  "peace  and  agreement"  were  under  serious 
discussion. 

As  Yeltsin  began  his  second  term,  the  strength  of  the  presi- 
dent's political  position  and  the  nature  of  his  intentions 
remained  unclear.  Yeltsin  ended  his  first  term  on  an  ominous 
note  by  retreating  completely  from  public  view  immediately 
after  his  election  victory.  The  heart  attack  that  Yeltsin  suffered 
between  the  two  rounds  of  the  election  was  identified  only  later 
as  the  cause  of  his  disappearance.

Beginning  with  the  first  round  of  the  presidential  election, 
Yeltsin's  physical  condition  exerted  a  growing  influence  over 
the  political  atmosphere  in  Russia.  In  the  fall  of  1996,  news  of 
the  president's  very  serious  heart  condition  intensified  specula- 
tion about  the  identity  of  likely  successors.  As  Yeltsin  main- 
tained a  limited  public  schedule  in  that  period,  three  figures, 
Chernomyrdin,  Lebed',  and  Moscow's  very  popular  mayor, 
Yuriy  Luzhkov,  jockeyed  openly  for  advantage  in  the  antici- 
pated post-Yeltsin  era — although  Chernomyrdin  clearly  lacked 
the  political  appeal  of  his  potential  rivals.  Those  maneuvers 
continued  after  Yeltsin's  heart  surgery  in  November. 

By  early  1997,  Russia's  apparent  lack  of  leadership  caused 
intense  concern  and  speculation  in  the  international  commu- 
nity, and  Yeltsin's  popularity  again  plummeted  as  workers  and 
pensioners  remained  unpaid.  In  March  1997,  Yeltsin  used  his 
annual  state  of  the  federation  speech  to  the  State  Duma  to  reas- 
sure domestic  and  foreign  opinion  and  to  reassert  his  presiden- 
tial power — a  goal  that  he  achieved  by  delivering  a  forceful  and 
coherent  speech.  Accusing  the  Government  of  failing  to  exe- 
cute his  commands,  Yeltsin  repeated  his  unfulfilled  1996  prom- 
ises of  wage  and  pension  payments,  accelerated  economic 
reform,  and  more  efficient  government. 

During  Yeltsin's  absence,  another  figure  bore  the  brunt  of 
opposition  attacks  on  the  administration.  In  1995  and  early 
1996,  Yeltsin  had  dismissed  reform  economist  Anatoliy  Chu- 
bays  from  two  high-level  economic  positions  in  response  to 
strong  criticism  from  antireform  factions.  However,  after 
directing  Yeltsin's  successful  1996  presidential  campaign,  Chu- 
bays  was  rewarded  with  the  chief  of  staff  position  in  Yeltsin's 
second  administration,  at  the  same  time  increasing  the  pros- 
pects that  the  pace  of  reform  would  increase. 

Although  too  unpopular  to  have  a  realistic  chance  at  the 
presidency,  Chubays  maneuvered  effectively  within  the  Yeltsin 
administration.  He  formed  an  alliance  with  Yeltsin's  ambitious 
daughter,  Tat'yana  Dyachenko,  who  was  rumored  to  have  sub- 
stantial influence  over  her  father's  policy  decisions.  The  work 
of  Chubays  was  widely  seen  in  the  dismissal  of  the  Aleksandr 
Korzhakov  coterie  in  June  and  of  Aleksandr  Lebed'  in  October. 
Chubays  was  credited  with  maintaining  some  sort  of  order  dur- 
ing Yeltsin's  convalescence  in  the  early  stages  of  the  second 
administration,  even  as  Chubays's  many  enemies  spread 
rumors  of  illegal  campaign  funding  and  links  with  organized 
crime.

Despite  speculation  that  Yeltsin  would  limit  Chubays's  power 
by  increasing  the  prestige  of  rivals — a  technique  Yeltsin  had 
used  throughout  his  presidency — in  the  Government  reorgani- 
zation of  March  1997  Yeltsin  advanced  Chubays  to  the  positions 
of  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  economic  affairs  and 
minister  of  the  economy.  Chubays  now  had  direct  control  of 
the  governmental  restructuring  that  Yeltsin  prescribed  to  end 
bureaucratic  gridlock,  and  the  new  faces  that  Yeltsin  appointed 
at  that  time  improved  the  prospect  that  the  new  minister  would 
be  able  to  accelerate  economic  reform  in  1997. 

In  July  1996,  experts  had  seen  Yeltsin's  creation  of  a  civilian 
advisory  Defense  Council  as  an  effort  to  balance  the  power  that 
Lebed'  had  gained  as  chief  of  the  Security  Council.  In  October 
the  head  of  the  Defense  Council,  Yuriy  Baturin,  supplanted 
Lebed'  as  the  primary  architect  of  military  reform,  dismissing 
six  top  generals  and  reassigning  several  who  remained.  By  the 
end  of  1996,  Baturin  was  in  a  bitter  battle  with  defense  minister 
Rodionov  for  authority  over  reform  policy.  By  March  1997, 
Rodionov's  position  in  the  administration  was  reported  to  be 
quite  tenuous. 

Late  in  1996,  another  extraconstitutional  organ  was  formed 
in  the  Yeltsin  administration:  a  permanent,  four-member  Con- 
sultative Council  that  included  the  president,  the  prime  minis- 
ter, and  the  speakers  of  the  two  houses  of  the  Federal  Assembly. 
The  council  was  to  meet  twice  a  month  in  an  effort  designed  to 
smooth  differences  between  the  two  branches  of  government. 
The  inclusion  of  the  State  Duma  speaker  brought  a  prominent 
KPRF  deputy,  Gennadiy  Seleznev,  into  a  top  advisory  group — a 
move  calculated  by  Yeltsin  and  Chubays  to  either  divide  or  con- 
ciliate the  strongest  of  the  opposition  parties.  The  fourth  mem- 
ber of  the  council  was  Yegor  Stroyev,  speaker  of  the  Federation 
Council  and  usually  a  Yeltsin  supporter.  During  Yeltsin's  ill- 
nesses, Chubays  represented  the  president  at  council  meetings. 

Already  in  the  mid-1990s,  the  executive  branch  contained 
numerous  directorates  and  commissions  answering  only  to  the 
president.  In  1996  the  addition  of  extraconstitutional  govern- 
ing bodies  such  as  the  Defense  Council  and  the  Consultative 
Council  continued  Yeltsin's  propensity  to  govern  by  decree  and 
outside  constitutionally  prescribed  lines  of  power.  According  to 
some  experts,  the  existence  of  seemingly  redundant  presiden- 
tial policy-making  groups  was  a  new  manifestation  of  Russia's 
long  tradition  of  arbitrary  rule;  according  to  others,  such 


Ixxxiii 


organs  were  necessary  to  circumvent  the  gridlock  of  opposition 
in  the  State  Duma. 

In  the  fall  of  1996,  Yeltsin's  illness  brought  demands  from  all 
political  factions  for  clarification  of  the  1993  constitution's 
vague  language  on  replacing  a  disabled  head  of  state:  the  con- 
ditions for  such  replacement  are  listed  in  the  constitution,  but 
the  authority  to  make  the  decision  is  not  specified.  In  this  case, 
Yeltsin  responded  by  temporarily  delegating  to  Prime  Minister 
Chernomyrdin  his  authority  as  commander  in  chief  of  the 
armed  forces,  head  of  internal  security,  and  custodian  of  the 
codes  needed  to  unleash  a  nuclear  attack.  Within  hours  of  his 
successful  heart  bypass  surgery  in  November,  Yeltsin  publicly 
reclaimed  full  control,  apparently  seeking  to  end  the  impres- 
sion of  a  power  vacuum  in  Moscow.  In  the  months  that  fol- 
lowed, however,  government  assurances  of  Yeltsin's  continued 
competence  met  increasing  skepticism  as  the  president 
appeared  only  in  carefully  edited  news  film.  In  the  first  months 
of  1997,  KPRF  deputies  introduced  motions  in  the  State  Duma 
to  impeach  Yeltsin  on  health  grounds,  and  the  Duma  discussed 
constitutional  amendments  limiting  the  powers  of  the  presi- 
dent. 

Between  September  1996  and  March  1997,  Yeltsin's  adminis- 
tration faced  a  new  political  challenge  when  a  series  of  regional 
elections  provided  the  KPRF  and  its  nationalist  allies  another 
opportunity  to  weaken  Yeltsin's  political  base.  Fifty-two  of  Rus- 
sia's eighty-nine  subnational  jurisdictions  were  to  elect  chief 
executives  during  that  period,  and  all  of  those  executives  are  ex 
officio  members  of  the  Federation  Council,  the  upper  house  of 
parliament  and  a  bastion  of  Yeltsin  support  until  1997.  (The 
chief  executives  of  republics  are  called  presidents;  those  of 
other  jurisdictions  carry  the  title  governor  or  administrative 
head.) 

Before  the  elections  began,  experts  identified  fifteen  of 
those  constituencies,  primarily  in  the  "Red  Belt"  along  the 
southern  border  from  the  North  Caucasus  to  the  Far  East,  as 
sure  to  elect  communist  leaders.  At  the  end  of  1996,  a  Yeltsin- 
appointed  incumbent  chief  executive  had  been  defeated  in 
twenty-four  of  the  forty-four  elections  decided  to  that  point. 
The  KPRF  had  backed  fifteen  of  the  new  officials,  and  six  had 
had  Yeltsin's  support.  Among  the  victors  were  former  vice  pres- 
ident and  outspoken  Yeltsin  critic  Aleksandr  Rutskoy,  who  was 
elected  governor  of  Kursk  Oblast,  and  Vasiliy  Starodubtsev,  a 
central  figure  in  the  1991  coup  against  the  Gorbachev  govern- 


lxxxiv 


ment,  who  was  elected  governor  of  Tula  Oblast.  In  most  cases, 
successful  candidates  took  less  partisan  positions  and  were 
more  ready  to  negotiate  with  their  opposition  than  experts  had 
predicted  when  the  elections  began.  Incumbents  generally 
fared  better  in  northern  and  urban  regions  where  economic 
conditions  were  the  most  favorable.  Yeltsin's  doubtful  health 
and  the  rescinding  of  his  1996  campaign  spending  promises 
hampered  some  progovernment  candidates.  All  the  chief  exec- 
utives elected  in  1996  were  expected  to  wield  greater  political 
power  because  they  now  had  direct  mandates  rather  than  pres- 
idential appointments,  and  that  legitimacy  also  would  bolster 
the  power  of  the  Federation  Council  vis-a-vis  the  State  Duma  in 
the  Federal  Assembly. 

In  1996  the  central  government's  economic  and  legislative 
control  of  subnational  jurisdictions  continued  to  slip  away  as 
the  power  of  regional  chief  executives  increased  proportion- 
ally. Governors  such  as  Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko  of  strategically 
vital  Maritime  (Primorskiy)  Territory  on  the  Pacific  coast  and 
Eduard  Rossel'  of  Sverdlovsk  Oblast  in  the  Urals  already  had 
established  personal  fiefdoms  outside  Moscow's  control. 
Nazdratenko  openly  challenged  the  national  administration  on 
a  number  of  issues,  including  the  transfer  of  a  small  parcel  of 
his  territory's  land  to  China  as  part  of  a  Sino-Russian  border 
treaty.  In  1993  Sverdlovsk  Oblast  briefly  declared  itself  a  repub- 
lic under  Rossel'.  As  of  January  1997,  Moscow  had  signed  bilat- 
eral agreements,  establishing  a  wide  variety  of  power-sharing 
relationships,  with  twenty-six  subnational  jurisdictions. 

By  1996  regional  governments  raised  50  percent  of  taxes  and 
accounted  for  70  percent  of  government  spending  in  Russia. 
Although  only  fifteen  of  eighty-nine  subnational  jurisdictions 
were  net  contributors  to  the  federal  budget  and  sixty-seven 
relied  on  federal  subsidies  for  pensions,  in  1996  Moscow  still 
had  no  centralized  system  to  account  for  movement  of  funds 
between  the  federal  government  and  the  regions.  Many  juris- 
dictions complained  that  the  1997  budget  did  not  allocate  suf- 
ficient funds  to  them  to  compensate  for  their  tax  payments  to 
Moscow.  As  of  March  1997,  no  subnational  jurisdiction  had 
received  a  full  allotment  of  federal  pension  funds,  and  only  ten 
jurisdictions  had  paid  their  federal  taxes  in  full. 

In  October  1996,  the  emergency  tax  committee  was  forced 
to  withdraw  its  threat  of  bankruptcy  proceedings  against  the 
Kama  Automobile  Plant  (KamAZ),  one  of  the  Republic  of 
Tatarstan's  largest  industries,  for  nonpayment  of  federal  taxes. 


lxxxv 


Citing  the  1994  power-sharing  treaty  between  the  republic  and 
the  federal  government,  Tatarstan's  president  Mintimer 
Shaimiyev  convinced  Chernomyrdin  that  ending  KamAZ's 
favorable  tax  status  would  intrude  on  the  republic's  economic 
sovereignty. 

Experts  predicted  that  tensions  between  Moscow  and  the 
subnational  governments  would  intensify  during  the  shaping 
of  Russia's  new  federal  system,  especially  as  that  system 
addresses  the  question  of  who  controls  the  country's  vast 
national  resources.  After  the  regional  elections,  a  loose  coali- 
tion of  jurisdictions  that  were  net  contributors  to  the  federal 
budget  ("donor  regions")  was  in  a  position  to  gain  significant 
economic  concessions  from  the  federal  government.  At  the 
same  time,  the  eight  regional  economic  associations,  which 
include  all  of  Russia's  eighty-nine  subnational  jurisdictions 
except  Chechnya,  showed  new  cohesiveness  and  also  were 
expected  to  gain  greater  autonomy  and  attention  from  Moscow 
in  1997.  Those  associations  are:  the  Far  East  and  Baikal  Associa- 
tion; the  Siberian  Accord  Association;  the  Greater  Volga  Associ- 
ation; the  Central  Russia  Association;  the  Cooperation 
Association  of  North  Caucasus  Republics,  Territories,  and 
Oblasts;  the  Black  Earth  Association;  the  Urals  Regional  Associ- 
ation; and  the  Nor th-West  Association. 

In  October  presidential  chief  of  staff  Chubays  began  a  cam- 
paign to  reverse  the  movement  toward  regional  autonomy. 
Chubays  called  for  a  review  of  the  many  regional  laws  that  con- 
travene the  national  constitution,  in  an  effort  to  curtail  the 
autonomy  that  such  legislation  encourages.  (Several  of  the 
regional  constitutions  adopted  after  1991  contain  language 
contradicting  the  national  constitution,  and  the  electoral  laws 
of  some  twenty-seven  regions  reportedly  violate  federal  law.) 
However,  the  project  was  postponed  because  regional  procura- 
tors, who  would  be  responsible  for  such  an  investigation,  lack 
sufficient  authority  over  regional  officials.  After  the  elections  of 
1996-97  gave  most  regional  leaders  a  popular  mandate,  the 
lack  of  federal  sanctions  on  subnational  jurisdictions  violating 
federal  law  became  a  more  significant  threat  to  the  integrity  of 
the  federation  as  well  as  to  human  rights  and  the  balance  of 
political  power  within  jurisdictions.  Meanwhile,  local  and 
municipal  administrations  chafed  under  restrictions  imposed 
by  regional  jurisdictions,  just  as  the  latter  complained  about 
Moscow's  restrictions.

In  the  post-Soviet  period,  Russia's  foreign  policy  has  shifted 
significantly,  most  often  in  response  to  domestic  rather  than 
foreign  conditions.  The  early  Yeltsin  administration,  repre- 
sented by  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Andrey  Kozyrev,  sought  to 
bring  Russia  fully  into  the  community  of  nations — especially 
Western  nations — and  to  dispel  the  aura  of  the  Evil  Empire. 
The  military  and  economic  competition  of  the  Cold  War  was 
replaced  by  a  series  of  cooperative  agreements  with  Western 
powers,  including  disarmament  treaties,  that  brought  eco- 
nomic and  humanitarian  aid  to  Russia.  The  vast  set  of  Soviet 
commitments  that  spanned  the  world  in  the  1980s  was  reduced 
in  an  effort  to  concentrate  limited  resources  in  the  most  useful 
areas. 

However,  a  strong  nationalist  faction  in  the  parliament  and 
elsewhere  saw  such  complaisance  as  the  surrender  of  the  pre- 
eminent, rightful  role  in  world  politics  that  had  been  won  in 
the  Soviet  era.  This  faction,  which  has  been  compared  with  the 
nineteenth-century  Slavophile  movement  that  sought  to  pro- 
tect Russian  culture  from  the  harmful  intrusion  of  Western  civ- 
ilization, has  urged  that  Russia  recapture  as  much  influence  as 
possible  in  the  former  Soviet  Union  and  the  former  Soviet 
empire  in  Central  Europe.  This  process  would  discourage  the 
influence  of  the  West  in  those  regions,  countering  the  ostensi- 
ble drive  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — 
see  Glossary)  to  push  Russia  out  of  the  continent  of  Europe. 
For  many  advocates  of  this  position,  the  preferred  area  of 
closer  foreign  relations  is  Asia,  and  a  new  anti-Western  alliance 
with  China  is  the  focal  point. 

In  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  Yeltsin  had  improved  Russia's 
international  image  by  participating  in  several  meetings  of  the 
Group  of  Seven  (G— 7 — see  Glossary)  as  well  as  his  regular  sum- 
mit conferences  with  United  States  presidents.  In  maintaining 
such  contacts,  Yeltsin  attempted  to  walk  a  line  between  making 
concessions  to  the  West  that  would  anger  Russian  nationalists 
and  taking  independent  positions  that  would  weaken  the  West- 
ern commitment  to  aid  Russia  during  its  transition  period.  As  a 
result  of  these  conflicting  demands,  in  the  mid-1990s  Russia's 
foreign  policy  positions  have  been  inconsistent,  and  Yeltsin, 
Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Yevgeniy  Primakov,  Chernomyrdin, 
and  other  official  spokesmen  often  have  issued  contradictory 
statements  on  important  issues. 

On  issues  such  as  Chechnya  and  human  rights  in  Russia, 
Western  diplomats  refrained  in  1996  from  criticizing  Yeltsin  for 


lxxxvii 


fear  of  damaging  his  prestige  at  home.  Before  the  August  1996 
cease-fire  in  Chechnya,  the  IMF  offered  Russia  the  second-larg- 
est loan  in  the  bank's  history,  and  the  Council  of  Europe  (see 
Glossary),  considered  a  guardian  of  human  rights  in  Europe, 
admitted  Russia  to  its  membership  despite  numerous  reports 
of  atrocities  in  Chechnya  and  noncompliance  with  the  coun- 
cil's policy  on  capital  punishment. 

However,  Yeltsin  received  substantial  criticism  from  the  West 
for  some  policies  that  failed  to  comply  with  international  stan- 
dards. Among  them  were  the  sale  of  nuclear  reactors,  subma- 
rines, and  other  critical  items  to  Iran  in  violation  of 
international  sanctions;  continued  dumping  and  careless  han- 
dling of  nuclear  materials  by  Russia's  civilian  and  military  agen- 
cies (criticism  coming  mainly  from  Japan  and  the  Scandinavian 
countries,  which  were  most  directly  affected) ;  and  Russia's  fail- 
ure to  comply  with  the  arms  limitations  of  the  Conventional 
Forces  in  Europe  Treaty  (CFE  Treaty — see  Glossary).  Most  of 
the  summit  meetings  of  the  mid-1990s  discussed  some  or  all  of 
those  questions,  but  few  solutions  emerged.  Early  in  1997,  Rus- 
sia's relationship  with  Iran  had  become  closer,  its  nuclear  safety 
policies  remained  unchanged,  and  CFE  Treaty  modifications 
were  under  discussion. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  major  point  of  conflict  in  the  struggle 
over  Western  influence  in  Russia  was  the  projected  expansion 
of  NATO  into  former  Warsaw  Pact  nations  of  what  is  now  called 
Central  Europe.  In  1995  and  1996,  numerous  statements  by  the 
Russian  government  rejected  the  possibility  that  countries  such 
as  Poland  and  Hungary  could  enter  NATO  without  dire  conse- 
quences. Russia's  statements  predicted  that,  by  isolating  and 
impoverishing  Russia,  a  NATO  presence  would  in  fact  reacti- 
vate the  Cold  War.  During  1996  government  spokesmen  threat- 
ened a  variety  of  diplomatic  and  military  reprisals  if  NATO 
membership  were  enlarged.  Most  experts  labeled  Russia's 
behavior  as  gamesmanship  aimed  at  gaining  the  most  advanta- 
geous possible  position  once  an  inevitable  first  round  of  NATO 
expansion  occurred. 

Despite  Russia's  threats,  in  1996  eleven  European  countries, 
including  the  three  Baltic  states — Estonia,  Latvia,  and  Lithua- 
nia— reiterated  their  enthusiasm  for  gaining  NATO  member- 
ship. In  early  1997,  Bulgaria  declared  its  desire  to  join,  and 
Georgia,  Moldova,  and  Ukraine  sought  closer  cooperation  with 
the  alliance. 


lxxxviii 


A  potentially  important  change  appeared  in  the  Russian 
position  at  the  end  of  1996.  In  September  the  United  States 
had  proposed  a  charter  that  would  give  Russia  a  special  rela- 
tionship with  NATO,  in  an  attempt  to  relieve  tensions  over  the 
expansion  issue.  In  January  1997,  Primakov  began  to  negotiate 
such  an  agreement  with  NATO  secretary  general  Javier  Solana. 
As  negotiations  proceeded,  two  of  Russia's  key  goals  emerged: 
obtaining  more  favorable  terms  in  the  CFE  Treaty  and  limiting 
the  NATO  military  presence  in  any  new  member  nation  in 
Central  Europe.  In  keeping  with  Russia's  position  that  NATO  is 
an  anachronistic  leftover  of  the  Cold  War,  Primakov  and  Cher- 
nomyrdin demanded  a  binding  treaty  obligating  NATO  to 
reform  itself  from  a  military  to  a  "political"  organization. 

As  conceived  in  the  West,  the  agreement  would  offer  Russia 
consultation  but  no  veto  on  NATO  expansion  decisions; 
increased  presence  of  Russian  observers  at  various  NATO  com- 
mand levels;  and  modification  of  existing  arms  reduction 
agreements  to  suit  Russia's  demands.  At  the  March  1997  Hels- 
inki summit,  Yeltsin  backed  the  agreement  as  a  way  around  the 
issue  of  NATO  expansion,  which  he  still  called  "a  mistake."  By 
that  time,  Primakov  and  Solana  had  agreed  on  most  of  the 
charter's  terms,  including  a  permanent  consultative  council  for 
discussion  of  issues  such  as  nuclear  security,  crisis  management, 
and  peacekeeping  operations.  However,  Primakov  insisted  on 
restricting  the  presence  of  NATO  forces  in  any  new  member 
nation,  a  concession  that  NATO  refused  because  it  would  inter- 
fere with  the  alliance's  basic  commitment  to  mutual  defense. 
Because  NATO  had  set  a  target  date  of  July  1997  for  the  first 
official  invitations  to  new  member  nations,  little  time  was  avail- 
able for  conflicting  views  to  be  mediated.  (Russia  demanded 
that  the  signing  of  the  Russia-NATO  charter  precede  and  be 
separate  from  the  NATO  summit  that  would  announce  the  invi- 
tations.) 

During  his  first  term  in  office,  Boris  Yeltsin  continued  the 
tradition,  begun  by  Mikhail  Gorbachev,  of  holding  regular 
summit  meetings  with  United  States  presidents.  The  second 
Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty  (START  II — see  Glossary)  was 
a  product  of  a  1993  summit  with  President  George  H.W.  Bush. 
Western  experts  saw  the  drastic  nuclear  arms  reductions  of 
START  II  as  a  way  for  Russia  to  cut  military  expenses  without 
sacrificing  national  security,  at  a  time  when  nuclear  parity  was 
an  increasingly  expensive  proposition.  But  as  Russia's  conven- 
tional military  forces  deteriorated  and  funding  declined  in  the 


lxxxix 


mid-1990s,  nuclear  strike  capability  assumed  a  more  prominent 
place  in  national  security  planning.  Therefore,  by  late  1996 
Russian  authorities  were  demanding  greater  limitations  on  sea- 
based  nuclear  warheads,  in  which  the  United  States  has  a  dis- 
tinct advantage;  greater  latitude  for  deployment  of  land-based 
missiles,  in  which  Russia  is  strongest;  and  revision  of  the  START 
II  restrictions  on  the  multiple-warhead  weapons  that  Russia 
considers  its  most  formidable  threat. 

In  October  1996,  United  States  secretary  of  defense  William 
Perry  met  strong  resistance  when  he  tried  to  convince  the  State 
Duma  and  Ministry  of  Defense  officials  in  Moscow  that  START 
II  ratification  would  benefit  both  sides.  At  the  same  time,  Rus- 
sia also  delayed  finalizing  an  agreement  on  classification  of 
anti-ballistic  missiles  (ABMs),  indicating  continuing  sensitivity 
about  the  prospect  of  the  United  States  building  a  missile  inter- 
ception system  that  would  negate  much  of  Russia's  nuclear 
strike  capacity.  Early  in  1997,  Western  defense  experts  began 
formulating  a  START  III  proposal  that  might  leapfrog  the 
START  II  deadlock  by  eliminating  at  least  some  of  the  most 
serious  obstacles.  But  the  largest  obstacle  was  the  NATO  issue: 
already  in  1995,  nationalists  and  many  moderates  in  the  State 
Duma  refused  to  even  consider  START  II  without  assurances 
that  NATO  would  not  move  eastward,  and  this  linkage 
remained  in  early  1997. 

In  the  early  stages  of  Yeltsin's  second  term,  high-level  diplo- 
matic contact  with  the  West  was  fitful  and  unproductive.  In  Sep- 
tember a  Moscow  visit  by  German  chancellor  Helmut  Kohl, 
Yeltsin's  most  vocal  supporter  among  Western  leaders,  failed  to 
bridge  the  two  countries'  differences  on  sanctions  on  Iraq 
(which  Russia  opposed),  NATO  expansion,  and  conditions  for 
expanded  German  investment  in  Russia.  In  late  December,  the 
first  foreign  leader  to  confer  with  Yeltsin  after  his  convales- 
cence was  China's  prime  minister  Li  Peng  rather  than  a  West- 
erner. At  that  time,  Russia  and  China  signed  new  bilateral 
agreements  on  cooperation  in  banking,  nuclear  power  plant 
construction,  and  the  sale  of  two  naval  destroyers  to  China.  In 
early  1997,  visits  by  Kohl  and  French  president  Jacques  Chirac 
to  Moscow  produced  no  breakthrough  on  the  NATO  expan- 
sion issue. 

The  Helsinki  summit,  the  first  such  meeting  since  April 
1996,  yielded  agreements  on  a  range  of  economic  matters;  Rus- 
sia was  promised  an  increased  role  in  the  G— 7,  whose  annual 
meetings  were  to  be  renamed  the  Summit  of  the  Eight,  and

Yeltsin  received  United  States  commitments  for  enhanced 
investment  and  integration  of  Russia  in  global  markets  and 
support  for  much-coveted  entry  into  the  World  Trade  Organi- 
zation (WTO — see  Glossary)  in  1998.  Yeltsin  pledged  renewed 
support  for  passage  of  START  II  in  the  State  Duma,  and  he  sup- 
ported a  START  III  agreement  that  would  further  reduce  stra- 
tegic arms.  The  two  presidents  pledged  support  for  ratification 
of  the  1993  Chemical  Weapons  Convention,  which  faced  stiff 
opposition  in  the  legislatures  of  both  countries.  Yeltsin  also 
unexpectedly  accepted  an  understanding  of  the  Anti-Ballistic 
Missile  Treaty  (ABM  Treaty — see  Glossary)  that  would  allow 
the  United  States  to  continue  developing  a  limited  ABM  sys- 
tem. 

Yeltsin's  robust  performance  at  the  summit  also  allayed  the 
health  fears  that  had  haunted  his  second  administration.  The 
president  received  strong  criticism  from  communist  and 
nationalist  factions  for  the  substantive  output  of  the  summit, 
but  experts  noted  that  Russia's  position  in  the  meeting  pro- 
vided little  negotiating  leverage. 

Russia  and  NATO  did  cooperate  successfully  in  Bosnia.  In 
September  1996,  Primakov  expressed  Russia's  willingness  to 
extend  the  assignment  of  Russian  troops  to  the  NATO  interna- 
tional peacekeeping  force,  IFOR,  with  which  they  had  func- 
tioned smoothly  for  more  than  a  year.  Russia's  continued 
participation  was  conditioned  on  the  lifting  of  international 
sanctions  against  Serbia.  The  sanctions  ended  in  October;  Rus- 
sia took  an  active  part  in  planning  the  next  phase  of  the  peace- 
keeping operation.  In  January  1997,  Yeltsin  approved 
extending  Russia's  participation  through  July  1998. 

Recovery  of  the  empire  of  the  Soviet  Union  became  a  for- 
eign policy  goal  of  increasing  importance  in  the  mid-1990s.  In 
the  Duma  elections  of  December  1995,  every  party  and  group 
mentioned  reintegration  of  the  CIS  states  in  its  foreign  policy 
platform.  In  1996  nationalists  used  a  variety  of  strategies  to 
encourage  the  government  to  extend  Russia's  influence  in  the 
CIS  countries.  In  three  former  Soviet  states  plagued  with  inter- 
nal conflict — Georgia,  Moldova,  and  Tajikistan — Russian 
troops  remained  in  ostensibly  peacekeeping  roles,  and  Russian 
negotiators  continued  to  sponsor  talks  between  hostile  groups. 
Many  experts  called  the  diplomatic  activity  an  insincere  effort 
to  achieve  stability  in  areas  where  continued  conflict  was  the 
only  justification  for  a  Russian  military  presence. 


xci 


In  late  1996,  the  State  Duma  overwhelmingly  approved  a 
permanent  Russian  force  in  the  breakaway  Dnestr  Moldavian 
Republic  (Transnistria)  in  Moldova,  claiming  erroneously  that 
most  of  the  republic's  citizens  are  Russian  and  thus  require 
protection.  (A  1994  treaty  with  Moldova,  which  the  State  Duma 
never  ratified,  provided  for  withdrawal  of  all  Russian  forces.) 
Early  in  1997,  Russian  officials  promised  that  forces  would  be 
withdrawn  when  the  Transnistria  question  was  settled,  while  at 
the  same  time  encouraging  the  separatists  to  push  for  full  inde- 
pendence. 

In  December  1996,  a  Federation  Council  resolution  officially 
claimed  the  city  of  Sevastopol',  located  on  Ukraine's  Black  Sea 
coast,  as  Russian  territory.  This  claim  continued  Russia's  post- 
Soviet  dispute  with  Ukraine  over  control  of  the  Black  Sea  Fleet 
that  the  two  countries  had  inherited  from  the  Soviet  Union. 
Moscow  mayor  Yuriy  Luzhkov,  hoping  to  gain  national  stature 
for  future  political  advancement,  became  a  main  spokesman 
for  the  claim  on  Sevastopol'.  In  1996  Yeltsin  and  Ukraine's  pres- 
ident Leonid  Kuchma  had  negotiated  terms  for  dividing  the 
fleet,  but  the  new  claims  by  Russian  nationalists  threatened  to 
sour  the  recently  improved  relations  between  Russia  and 
Ukraine.  Spurred  by  Russia's  territorial  claims,  in  January  1997 
Ukraine  proposed  a  "special  partnership"  with  NATO,  ratifica- 
tion of  which  was  expected  at  the  midyear  NATO  summit. 

The  bitter  border  disputes  that  had  erupted  with  Estonia 
and  Latvia  at  the  time  of  those  republics'  declarations  of  inde- 
pendence continued  into  1997,  although  in  both  cases  some 
concessions  were  made  in  late  1996  and  early  1997.  As  progress 
was  made  on  territorial  issues,  the  main  sticking  point  in  1997 
was  Russia's  requirement  that  the  two  Baltic  states  change  their 
policy  against  granting  dual  citizenship  to  their  Russian  popu- 
lations. 

Russia  also  struggled  to  maintain  as  much  as  possible  of  its 
Soviet-era  access  to  the  rich  natural  resources  of  the  Caspian 
Sea,  against  the  claims  of  former  Soviet  republics  Azerbaijan, 
Kazakstan,  and  Turkmenistan.  Allied  with  Iran,  Russia  called 
for  joint  jurisdiction  of  resources  by  all  adjoining  states  rather 
than  allocation  according  to  national  borders.  The  latter  sys- 
tem, advocated  by  the  other  three  former  republics,  would 
place  most  Caspian  oil  fields  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  Iran 
and  Russia.  In  October  1996,  Russia  amended  its  previous 
hard-line  approach  somewhat,  but  the  issue  promised  to  be 
under  negotiation  for  an  extended  period.

Early  in  1996,  a  customs  union  agreement  was  concluded 
among  Belarus,  Kazakstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  and  Russia,  significantly 
reducing  trade  barriers  within  that  group  (and  simplifying  the 
smuggling  of  narcotics  from  Central  Asia  into  Russia).  In 
November  1996,  Russia  reversed  its  recent  policy  of  reducing 
credits  to  other  CIS  countries,  increasing  its  credit  allotment 
for  CIS  partners  by  about  fifteen  times  in  the  1997  draft  bud- 
get. Those  credits  are  limited,  however,  to  the  purchase  of  Rus- 
sian goods.  The  total  debt  of  CIS  countries  to  Russia  was 
estimated  at  US$6  billion,  plus  US$3  billion  in  unpaid  energy 
bills,  prior  to  the  credit  extension.  Russia's  CIS  trade  figures  for 
early  1997  showed  a  decline  in  most  categories,  with  natural 
gas  accounting  for  the  bulk  of  exports  within  the  common- 
wealth. 

Russia's  stature  in  the  CIS  suffered  setbacks  in  the  1990s  as 
other  CIS  nations  took  independent  positions  on  a  variety  of 
issues.  From  the  beginning,  charter  members  Turkmenistan 
and  Azerbaijan  took  very  independent  positions:  contrary  to 
Russia's  desire  to  maintain  a  military  presence  throughout  the 
CIS,  Azerbaijan  allowed  no  Russian  troops  at  all  on  its  soil,  and 
Turkmenistan  maintained  joint  command  of  all  military  units. 
Kazakstan  and  Turkmenistan  continued  to  seek  Western  sup- 
port in  bypassing  the  Russian  pipelines  upon  which  they  previ- 
ously had  depended  for  their  oil  and  natural  gas  shipments  in 
the  Soviet  system.  Early  in  1997,  Kazakstan's  president  Nursul- 
tan  Nazarbayev,  a  consistent  and  influential  advocate  of  eco- 
nomic integration  of  the  newly  independent  states,  criticized 
Russia's  leadership  of  the  CIS,  calling  for  diversification  of  con- 
trol in  order  to  energize  the  moribund  organization. 

Belarus,  whose  president,  Alyaksandr  Lukashyenka,  had 
pushed  his  country  toward  reunification  with  Russia,  suffered  a 
constitutional  crisis  late  in  1996.  Lukashyenka's  bid  for  authori- 
tarian power  provoked  strong  nationalist  opposition  in  the  par- 
liament of  Belarus.  It  also  brought  unfavorable  international 
attention  to  Russia's  dominant  position  in  the  new  bilateral 
relationship  established  by  the  1996  Community  of  Sovereign 
Republics  treaty.  Unsuccessful  in  mediating  the  dispute 
between  Lukashyenka  and  the  Belarusian  parliament,  Russia 
continued  staunch  support  for  Lukashyenka  in  early  1997, 
although  Russia's  reform  factions  opposed  closer  relations  that 
would  require  Russia  to  support  Belarus's  backward  economy. 
A  new  agreement  signed  by  Yeltsin  and  Lukashyenka  in  March 
1997  reaffirmed  the  1996  treaty  but  increased  the  controversy 


xciii 


in  Moscow  between  reformers — including  Chubays  and  most 
of  Yeltsin's  new  top-level  Government  appointees — and  nation- 
alists, who  saw  union  with  Belarus  as  the  first  step  in  restoring 
the  Soviet  Union. 

In  1996  Uzbekistan,  the  strongest  of  the  five  Central  Asian 
CIS  states,  began  a  concentrated  effort  to  cultivate  commercial 
and  diplomatic  relations  with  Western  countries  and  Israel.  In 
May  1996,  Uzbekistan's  president  Islam  Karimov  criticized  the 
Economic  Cooperation  Organization  of  Islamic  nations,  of 
which  Uzbekistan  is  a  member,  for  its  anti-Israeli  and  anti- 
United  States  positions;  then  he  made  a  state  visit  to  the  United 
States  to  improve  bilateral  relations.  In  January  1997,  Karimov 
voiced  support  for  expansion  of  NATO. 

In  November  Kazakstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  and  Uzbekistan 
announced  plans  for  a  Central  Asian  peacekeeping  battalion  to 
be  used  in  United  Nations-sponsored  operations  and  to  be 
trained  within  NATO's  Partnership  for  Peace  (PfP — see  Glos- 
sary) program.  The  new  unit's  Western  connections  were  a  sig- 
nal that  the  wealthiest  Central  Asian  countries  wished  to 
reduce  Russia's  role  in  regional  security.  Russia  responded  by 
seeking  joint  action  with  the  Central  Asian  republics  in  defend- 
ing against  infiltration  by  Afghanistan's  aggressively  fundamen- 
talist Taliban  movement.  The  Russian  gambit  gained  support 
from  Karimov  and  Tajikistan's  president  Imomali  Rahmonov. 
At  the  CIS  summit  in  March  1997,  Yeltsin  attempted  to  foster 
unity  and  to  reassert  Russia's  dominance,  but  Georgia,  Kazak- 
stan, Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan  reiterated  their  individual 
national  concerns,  complained  about  the  CIS's  ineffectiveness, 
and  defended  their  right  to  form  relationships  outside  the  con- 
text of  the  full  organization.  Yeltsin's  chief  vehicle  for  eco- 
nomic reintegration  was  to  be  his  Concept  for  Integrated 
Economic  Development  of  the  CIS,  which  CIS  foreign  minis- 
ters refused  to  discuss  pending  modification. 

In  February  1997,  NATO  secretary  general  Javier  Solana 
received  a  warm  reception  when  he  visited  Georgia  and  Mol- 
dova. Moldova's  president  Petru  Lucinschi  requested  a  NATO 
security  guarantee  for  the  borders  of  his  neutral  country,  show- 
ing concern  for  the  continued  presence  of  Russian  forces  in 
Transnistria.  Georgia's  president  Eduard  Shevardnadze  was 
frustrated  after  more  than  two  years  of  fruitless  Russia-bro- 
kered negotiations  with  Georgia's  separatist  republic,  Abkha- 
zia. The  failure  to  resolve  territorial  and  refugee  issues  there 
postponed  Georgia's  unification  and,  ultimately,  its  indepen- 


xciv 


dence  from  Russian  military  assistance.  Georgia  concluded  sev- 
eral bilateral  military  agreements  with  NATO  member 
countries  in  1996.  In  his  talks  with  Solana,  Shevardnadze  char- 
acterized Georgia  as  an  integral  part  of  the  new  European  zone 
of  security  to  be  formed  once  NATO  expanded.  (Early  in  1997, 
the  Group  of  Russian  Forces  in  the  Transcaucasus  began  with- 
drawing units  from  Georgia  into  Russia  as  part  of  the  overall 
military  downsizing  program.) 

Of  the  countries  Solana  visited,  only  Armenia  continues  to 
seek  extensive  military  assistance  from  Russia.  In  1997  Armenia 
still  was  under  blockade  by  Azerbaijan  and  Turkey,  traditionally 
hostile  Muslim  states  that  nearly  surround  the  country,  and 
Russia  supported  Armenia  in  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict 
with  Azerbaijan — factors  that  made  Russia  Armenia's  only  alter- 
native for  regional  economic  and  security  assistance. 

The  appointment  of  the  Arabist  Primakov  as  minister  of  for- 
eign affairs  in  January  1996  continued  the  turn  of  Russia's  for- 
eign policy  from  West  to  East,  and  diplomatic  activity  in  the 
East  increased  in  1996 — despite  official  protestations  that  Rus- 
sia seeks  a  balance  between  East  and  West.  By  the  end  of  1996, 
Russia  and  China  had  resolved  several  of  the  issues  that  had 
split  the  major  communist  powers  for  several  decades,  and 
both  sides  seemed  intent  on  forming  additional  ties  in  1997. 
Meanwhile,  accelerated  commercial  activity  in  Russia's  Mari- 
time (Primorskiy)  Territory  encouraged  new  agreements 
between  Russia  and  the  two  Koreas,  and  progress  was  made  in 
late  1996  in  resolving  the  fifty-year  stalemate  with  Japan  over 
Russian  occupation  of  four  of  the  Kuril  Islands.  New  initiatives 
also  went  to  the  prosperous  member  nations  of  the  Association 
of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  expanding  the  drive  to 
make  Russia  a  Pacific  Rim  commercial  power.  In  November 
1996,  Primakov  visited  China,  Japan,  and  Mongolia  with  the 
stated  goal  of  improving  Russia's  position  in  vital  Asian  mar- 
kets. Primakov  visited  Iran  the  following  month.  Russia  also  felt 
that  establishing  its  identity  as  an  Asian  power  was  crucial 
because  it  had  been  excluded  from  several  prosperous  Pacific 
Rim  trading  groups  and  from  talks  on  Korean  unification. 
China's  rapid  emergence  as  a  world  economic  power  also  was  a 
primary  concern. 

In  1996  Russia  saw  the  presence  of  Primakov  in  the  Ministry 
of  Foreign  Affairs,  Western  sanctions  against  Iraq,  and  the  elec- 
tion of  a  hard-line  government  in  Israel  as  creating  conditions 
in  the  Middle  East  that  would  favor  a  return  to  the  Soviet 


xcv 


Union's  role  as  champion  of  the  Arab  countries  in  the  region. 
Russia  had  a  special  interest  in  freeing  Iraq  from  economic 
sanctions  because  Iraq  was  to  begin  repaying  its  substantial 
debt  to  Russia  once  oil  exports  resumed,  and  lucrative  new 
bilateral  deals  were  negotiated  in  1996.  For  this  reason,  in  Sep- 
tember 1996  the  United  States  bombing  of  Iraqi  targets  and 
the  threat  of  extended  international  sanctions  brought  harsh 
criticism  from  Moscow. 

Meanwhile,  Russia  continued  cultivating  relations  with  Iran, 
another  international  pariah.  A  third  Kilo-class  submarine 
went  from  Russia  to  Iran  in  November  1996,  and  the  transfer  of 
nuclear-reactor  technology  continued  despite  Western  objec- 
tions. In  the  second  half  of  1996,  as  another  token  of  Russia's 
importance  in  the  region,  Primakov  also  sought  a  more  active 
role  in  Arab-Israeli  peace  talks. 

Whatever  its  relations  with  foreign  countries,  however,  no 
foreign  power  threatened  Russia's  security  in  the  1990s,  and 
domestic  conditions  were  the  key  determinant  of  Russia's 
future.  In  the  1990s,  Russian  society,  until  recently  held 
together  by  the  forced  observance  of  Soviet  power,  seemed  to 
lack  any  sort  of  glue  that  could  be  used  to  combat  the  forces  of 
economic  fragmentation.  In  the  early  post-Soviet  years,  religion 
re-emerged  as  an  important  factor  in  the  lives  of  many  Rus- 
sians, but  cultural  and  intellectual  institutions  showed  signs  of 
decline  (production  of  art,  literature,  and  scientific  books 
dropped  sharply  in  the  mid-1990s,  as  did  newspaper  publica- 
tion), and  citizens  showed  little  interest  in  forming  indepen- 
dent civic  groups.  Despite  guarantees  of  equal  rights  in  the 
1993  constitution,  minority  ethnic  groups  have  experienced 
serious  discrimination  and  even  violence  in  Russia's  cities,  and 
hints  of  religious  intolerance  have  emerged  as  well.  Social 
resentments  have  festered  as  the  economic  status  of  most  Rus- 
sians deteriorated  and  a  new  elite  flaunted  its  wealth. 

The  emigre  sociologist  Vladimir  Shlapentokh  observed  in 
1996  that  personal  gain  had  become  the  most  important  value 
in  Russian  society  and  that  the  newly  democratized  govern- 
ment institutions  offered  little  authority  against  dishonest 
behavior  because  those  institutions  are  themselves  rife  with 
corruption.  The  inability  of  government  to  maintain  law  and 
order  through  its  democratic  institutions  has  provoked  author- 
itarian behavior  by  the  Yeltsin  administration,  whose  security 
agencies  have  maintained  a  large  share  of  their  Soviet-era 
autonomy. 


xcvi 


Optimists  point  to  the  next  generation  of  Russians,  who  will 
have  formed  their  civic  habits  independent  of  Soviet  influence, 
as  the  basis  of  democratic  renewal  and  a  new  civil  society.  The 
three  orderly  and  fair  national  elections  of  1993-96  offer  some 
hope  for  this  prognosis.  The  relative  calm  with  which  Russians 
have  accepted  the  agonies  of  transition  has  provided  an  oppor- 
tunity for  new  institutions  to  develop,  but  such  a  passive  public 
attitude  may  not  bode  well  for  participatory  democracy.  West- 
ern influences,  which  were  vital  to  the  postcommunist  progress 
of  Poland,  Hungary,  and  the  Czech  Republic,  have  penetrated 
Russia  only  in  random  fashion,  and  they  met  increasing  resis- 
tance in  the  mid-1990s.  That  resistance  has  dampened  the  gov- 
ernment's commitment  to  economic  and  political  reform  and 
obscured  the  prognosis  for  the  transition  process. 

By  1996  the  reforms  envisioned  in  1992  had  reached  a  pla- 
teau quite  short  of  their  final  goals.  Cynicism,  corruption,  and 
the  president's  long  period  of  inactivity  had  sapped  the 
momentum  of  reform  programs,  and  an  entrenched  bureau- 
cracy blocked  further  initiatives.  In  1997  Russia  remained  an 
international  power  in  some  respects,  but  its  search  for  ways  to 
preserve  that  status  was  increasingly  uncertain. 

March  31,  1997 

*  *  * 

In  the  months  following  the  preparation  of  this  manuscript, 
several  events  of  importance  occurred.  In  April  1997,  shortly 
after  the  United  States  Congress  ratified  the  controversial 
Chemical  Weapons  Convention  outlawing  the  manufacture 
and  sale  of  chemical  weapons,  the  State  Duma  refused  passage 
on  the  grounds  that  the  cost  of  destroying  Russia's  chemical 
weapons  supply,  the  largest  in  the  world,  was  prohibitively  high. 
Although  the  Duma  promised  to  reconsider  the  measure  in  the 
fall  of  1997,  its  decision  caused  consternation  in  the  United 
States,  which  had  expected  reciprocity  on  that  issue. 

In  the  spring  of  1997,  Russia  continued  to  affirm  its  commit- 
ment to  craft  a  foreign  policy  independent  of  international 
opinion.  In  April  an  official  Moscow  visit  by  Iranian  head  of 
parliament  Ali  Akbar  Nateq-Noori — one  day  after  a  German 
court  had  found  Iran  guilty  of  assassinating  exiled  dissidents — 
was  met  by  expressions  of  friendship  from  President  Yeltsin. 
There  were  indications  that  Russia's  military  and  economic 


xcvii 


deals  with  Iran,  criticized  sharply  in  the  West  because  of  Iran's 
support  for  terrorist  groups,  would  continue  or  expand.  Yeltsin 
and  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Yevgeniy  Primakov  also 
expressed  support  for  Syria's  position  in  peace  talks  with  Israel, 
expanding  Russia's  effort  to  reestablish  influence  in  the  Middle 
East. 

Shortly  thereafter,  a  Moscow  summit  meeting  with  Jiang 
Zemin,  president  of  China,  produced  a  statement  reinforcing 
the  two  nations'  "multipolar"  foreign  policy  as  a  balance  against 
United  States  domination  of  the  post-Soviet  world.  The  leaders 
signed  an  agreement  to  reduce  troops  and  equipment  along 
the  Sino-Russian  border  by  15  percent.  The  troop  maximum 
was  set  at  130,000  for  each  side.  Neighboring  countries  Kazak- 
stan,  Kyrgyzstan,  and  Tajikistan  also  signed  the  agreement. 
Yeltsin  announced  that  military-industrial  entrepreneur  Arka- 
diy  Vol'skiy  would  head  the  Russian  delegation  to  a  new  Sino- 
Russian  standing  committee  on  friendship,  peace,  and  develop- 
ment scheduled  to  go  into  operation  sometime  in  1997.  In 
April  Russia  also  announced  that  two  new  guided-missile 
destroyers,  previously  intended  for  the  Russian  naval  forces, 
would  be  delivered  to  China  in  1997.  However,  despite  official 
rhetoric  and  new  agreements,  in  mid-1997  a  substantial  part  of 
Russia's  foreign  policy  establishment  saw  China  as  a  stopgap 
partner  until  permanent  relationships  could  be  forged  with  the 
United  States,  Western  Europe,  and/or  Japan.  In  May  1997, 
Japan  and  Russia  began  high-level  defense  talks,  Japan 
dropped  its  objection  to  Russia's  membership  in  the  G-7  orga- 
nization, and  Russia  showed  some  signs  of  compromise  in  the 
continuing  dispute  over  four  Russian-held  islands  in  the  Kuril 
chain  north  of  Japan.  Based  on  Japan's  change  of  policy,  Yeltsin 
participated  as  a  full  member  in  the  June  meeting  of  the  newly 
renamed  G— 8. 

In  May  Primakov's  long  negotiations  with  NATO  officials 
yielded  an  agreement  defining  special  status  for  Russia  in 
NATO  in  return  for  Russia's  acceptance  of  a  first  round  of 
NATO  expansion  into  Central  Europe.  The  most  difficult 
obstacle,  Russia's  demand  that  no  nuclear  or  conventional 
NATO  forces  be  deployed  in  new  NATO  member  nations,  was 
overcome  by  a  general  statement  that  neither  nuclear  nor  con- 
ventional forces  would  be  deployed  under  normal  circum- 
stances. Both  sides  claimed  that  the  agreement  vindicated  their 
position,  although  NATO  made  no  firm  commitment  not  to 
deploy  forces.  The  centerpiece  of  the  agreement,  which  Yeltsin 


xcviii 


signed  in  Paris  on  May  27,  is  a  permanent  council  consisting  of 
the  secretary  general  of  NATO,  a  Russian  ambassador,  and  a 
representative  of  the  full  NATO  membership.  Although  Yeltsin 
described  this  council  as  giving  Russia  a  veto  over  NATO  deci- 
sions, only  specific  security  issues  are  to  be  discussed  in  the  new 
body.  The  alliance's  major  political  decision-making  process 
remains  separate.  The  first  meeting  of  the  council  took  place  in 

July- 

The  agreement,  officially  termed  a  "founding  act,"  is  not 
legally  binding  and  did  not  require  ratification  by  the  parlia- 
ments of  the  signatory  countries.  Having  signed  the  act,  Russia 
officially  ended  its  objections  to  full  NATO  membership  for  the 
Czech  Republic,  Hungary,  and  Poland,  which  are  expected  to 
become  full  NATO  members  in  1999.  The  agreement  also 
improved  the  prospect  that  the  Russian  economy  would  benefit 
from  closer  contacts  with  the  West.  Public  reaction  in  Russia 
was  muted,  although  nationalist  politicians  claimed  that  Russia 
had  sustained  a  serious  diplomatic  defeat. 

Meanwhile,  the  status  of  international  arms  treaties 
remained  unclear.  In  July  talks  among  the  thirty  signatory 
nations  of  the  CFE  Treaty — including  Russia  and  all  the  NATO 
countries — yielded  Russia  some  concessions  on  the  ratio  of 
NATO  to  Russian  conventional  arms  in  Europe.  However,  four 
CIS  countries — Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  Moldova,  and  Ukraine — 
had  objected  that  relaxation  of  CFE  restrictions  on  Russia's 
flank  quotas  for  troop  deployment  in  or  near  CIS  countries 
would  threaten  their  national  security.  The  final  treaty  modifi- 
cation made  overall  force  reductions  in  Europe  but  did  not 
include  the  limitations  on  NATO  forces  in  Central  Europe  that 
Russia  had  demanded  in  return  for  approval  of  NATO  expan- 
sion. 

As  of  June  1997,  Yeltsin  had  not  made  a  renewed  effort  to 
gain  State  Duma  ratification  of  the  START  II  agreement, 
although  he  had  promised  President  Clinton  at  the  Helsinki 
summit  that  he  would  do  so.  At  Helsinki  the  United  States  had 
eased  some  terms  of  START  II  to  improve  the  treaty's  prospects 
for  passage  in  the  Duma. 

In  May  President  Asian  Maskhadov  of  Chechnya  (Chechnya- 
Ichkeria)  signed  a  peace  treaty  with  Russia.  In  the  very  brief 
treaty,  both  sides  renounced  the  use  of  force  against  the  other. 
The  official  categorization  of  the  agreement  as  a  peace  treaty 
was  a  concession  by  Russia,  which  earlier  had  refused  to  sign 
such  a  treaty  with  what  it  considered  an  integral  part  of  the  fed- 


xcix 


eration.  The  document  did  not  mention  independence  for  the 
breakaway  republic — a  potentially  divisive  issue  that  both  sides 
avoided  in  the  interest  of  achieving  peace — but  the  form  of  the 
treaty  was  that  used  between  two  equal  states  subject  to  interna- 
tional law,  hence  a  tacit  recognition  of  Chechnya-Ichkeria's 
independence. 

Russia  also  signed  agreements  for  economic  aid  to  Chech- 
nya, and  Yeltsin's  negotiator  Boris  Berezovskiy  offered  several 
major  concessions,  including  an  official  apology  for  all  of  Rus- 
sia's historical  incursions  into  Chechnya,  in  an  effort  to  stave 
off  full  independence.  Meanwhile,  radical  Chechen  groups 
continued  kidnappings  and  terrorist  acts,  casting  doubt  on  the 
authority  of  the  Maskhadov  government. 

Chechnya  continued  to  occupy  a  critical  position  in  Russia's 
pipeline  politics,  which  became  increasingly  complex  in  the 
mid-1990s  as  more  countries  sought  participation  in  the  oil 
wealth  of  Azerbaijan  and  Kazakstan.  As  its  price  for  allowing  oil 
to  flow  through  Chechnya  en  route  to  export  from  Novo- 
rossiysk on  the  Black  Sea,  Chechnya  demanded  recognition  as 
a  full  partner  in  the  endeavor.  Because  an  alternative  line 
through  Georgia  and  Turkey  would  eliminate  both  Novo- 
rossiysk and  Chechnya — hence  all  Russian  participation — from 
lucrative  new  shipments,  in  July  Russia  signed  a  trilateral  agree- 
ment with  Azerbaijan  and  Chechnya,  granting  Chechnya  an 
equal  role.  Income  from  oil  shipments  was  expected  to  be  an 
important  element  in  stabilizing  Chechnya's  still  rocky  internal 
security  situation. 

The  international  Caspian  Pipeline  Consortium,  founded  in 
1992  to  bring  oil  from  Kazakstan  to  the  West,  has  been  plagued 
by  internal  friction  among  partner  companies,  which  represent 
six  countries  (Britain,  Italy,  Kazakstan,  Oman,  Russia,  and  the 
United  States).  In  early  1997,  however,  the  consortium  showed 
signs  of  agreement  on  the  Russian  section  of  a  new  line  that 
would  deliver  oil  from  Kazakstan's  Tengiz  fields  to  Novoros- 
siysk. In  April  Yeltsin  signed  the  December  1996  agreement  on 
division  of  shares  among  the  consortium  partners.  Increased 
United  States  activity  in  the  region's  new  oil  fields  was  a  major 
reason  that  Russia  signed  the  trilateral  pipeline  agreement 

Russia's  relations  with  other  CIS  countries  continue  to  be 
unsettled.  In  April  both  houses  of  Russia's  Federal  Assembly 
ratified  the  treaty  permitting  long-term  deployment  of  Russian 
forces  in  Armenia.  This  move  caused  alarm  in  neighboring 
Azerbaijan  (still  fighting  and  negotiating  with  Armenia  over 


c 


Nagorno-Karabakh),  Georgia  (through  which  additional  Rus- 
sian troops  would  pass  en  route  to  Armenia),  and  Turkey  (near 
whose  border  additional  Russian  troops  might  be  stationed). 
Disclosures  of  secret  deliveries  of  Russian  arms  to  Armenia  in 
1994-96  already  had  alarmed  Azerbaijan,  and  the  military 
treaty  seemingly  committed  Armenia  to  a  long  term  as  a  Rus- 
sian satellite.  However,  the  terms  of  the  July  1997  treaty  with 
Azerbaijan  implicitly  reduced  the  prospect  of  future  Russian 
support  for  Armenia  in  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict.  In  May 
a  friendship  treaty  with  Ukraine  resolved  division  of  the  Black 
Sea  Fleet  and  jurisdiction  in  Sevastopol',  the  fleet's  largest  port, 
among  other  treaty  provisions. 

Meanwhile,  other  CIS  countries  continued  to  deemphasize 
CIS  (largely  Russian)  investment  and  trade  agreements  in  favor 
of  Western  and  Japanese  deals  with  more  favorable  conditions. 
According  to  an  April  1997  report,  90  percent  of  Kazakstan's 
enterprises  had  at  least  some  investments  from  non-CIS 
sources.  Because  Kazakstan's  president  Nazarbayev  was  a 
staunch  supporter  of  CIS  integration,  this  statistic  was  espe- 
cially bad  news  for  Russia's  efforts  to  bind  together  and  domi- 
nate the  organization.  In  1997  Russian  authorities  also  were 
alarmed  by  an  incipient  trilateral  agreement  among  Azer- 
baijan, Georgia,  and  Ukraine,  which  began  cooperating  in  sev- 
eral critical  areas  of  security  and  economics  where  Russia  had 
enjoyed  substantial  influence. 

In  May  1997,  Yeltsin's  Security  Council  completed  a  long- 
awaited  national  security  doctrine.  The  document,  unpub- 
lished but  leaked  extensively,  included  economic,  foreign-pol- 
icy, and  military  elements  in  a  general  description  of  Russia's 
present  security  situation  and  its  primary  goals.  Improvement 
of  domestic  economic  and  social  conditions,  rather  than  geo- 
political advancement,  was  listed  as  the  primary  requirement 
for  enhanced  national  security.  The  most  aggressive  element  of 
the  statement  was  a  revocation  of  Mikhail  Gorbachev's  pledge 
that  the  Soviet  Union  never  would  initiate  the  use  of  nuclear 
weapons  in  a  war.  The  new  stance  was  described  by  Western 
experts  as  a  volley  in  the  diplomatic  conflict  over  NATO  expan- 
sion and  a  reflection  of  the  acute  deterioration  of  Russia's  con- 
ventional forces.  Because  the  legislative  branch  had  not  been 
consulted  in  the  creative  process,  experts  doubted  that  the 
anti-Yeltsin  State  Duma  would  grant  the  approval  necessary  for 
the  doctrine  to  become  official.

Russia's  defense  establishment  remained  unsettled  in  mid- 
1997  after  Yeltsin,  long  dissatisfied  with  the  pace  of  military 
reform,  fired  Chief  of  Staff  Viktor  Samsonov  and  Minister  of 
Defense  Igor'  Rodionov.  General  Igor'  Sergeyev  was  named  to 
replace  Rodionov.  At  the  same  time,  Yeltsin  created  two  new 
military  reform  commissions.  The  first,  headed  by  Prime  Minis- 
ter Chernomyrdin,  was  to  deal  with  military  construction;  the 
second,  headed  by  First  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Chubays,  was  to 
deal  with  military  finances.  Experts  saw  these  moves  as  a  victory 
for  civilian  officials  who  advocated  reassigning  the  military's 
"hidden  reserves"  rather  than  allocating  additional  funds  for 
military  reform.  In  July  Yeltsin  outlined  a  comprehensive  plan 
for  reducing  the  military  and  consolidating  the  five  branches 
into  two,  again  emphasizing  reallocation  of  existing  resources. 
The  drafting  procedure  and  content  of  the  plan  attracted 
strong  criticism  from  government  and  military  officials. 

Russia's  internal  security  situation  also  remained  unstable  in 
mid-1997  as  the  country's  crime  wave  continued.  The  Ministry 
of  Internal  Affairs  (MVD)  reported  a  reduction  of  12  percent 
in  overall  crime  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  year,  with  substantial 
drops  in  murders,  assaults,  thefts,  and  robberies.  However, 
there  was  no  evidence  of  a  reduction  in  mafiya  protection  activ- 
ity and  the  corruption  and  crime  associated  with  it.  The  7,500 
murders  committed  in  1996  were  the  most  ever  for  a  single 
year.  Meanwhile,  the  MVD's  "Clean  Hands  Campaign"  reported 
that  in  1996  some  21,000  police  officials  had  been  fired 
because  of  misconduct,  including  mafiya  connections.  Capital 
punishment  continued  to  be  a  sensitive  political  issue: 
although  Russia  was  obligated  by  its  1996  admission  to  the 
Council  of  Europe  to  end  capital  punishment,  the  crime  wave 
continued  to  bolster  strong  public  feeling  against  such  a 
change.  Human  rights  organizations  estimated  that  140  people 
were  executed  in  1996,  the  fourth-largest  total  in  the  world. 

The  prison  system  continued  to  suffer  grave  problems  in 
1997.  In  April  an  Amnesty  International  report  listed  torture, 
lack  of  bail,  acute  crowding,  epidemics  of  tuberculosis,  and 
long  periods  of  pretrial  detention  as  frequent  conditions  in 
Russia's  prisons  and  jails.  An  estimated  300,000  prisoners  (up 
from  233,000  in  1994)  were  in  pretrial  custody,  which  lasted  for 
an  average  of  ten  months.  In  mid-1997  the  Government 
announced  an  amnesty  program  that  would  affect  as  many  as 
440,000  Russian  prisoners,  targeting  mainly  those  in  pretrial 
detention.  Because  Russia's  incarceration  rate  was  about  ten 


cii 


times  that  of  West  European  nations,  its  1997  prison  budget 
was  much  higher  than  its  health  care  budget.  Prison  reform 
received  little  support  either  from  Minister  of  Internal  Affairs 
Anatoliy  Kulikov  or  from  the  majority  of  State  Duma  deputies. 

Overdue  wages  were  another  continuing  result  of  the 
national  budget  deficit.  By  midyear  Russia's  workers  were  owed 
an  estimated  US$9.5  billion,  and  the  amount  continued  to 
grow.  Although  the  nationwide  labor  shutdowns  called  by 
unions  in  November  1996  and  March  1997  had  failed  to  attract 
wide  support,  the  number  of  local  shutdowns  increased  notice- 
ably in  the  first  half  of  1997.  Miners,  doctors,  and  teachers 
blockaded  roads  and  railroads  and  occupied  administrative 
buildings  to  protest  continued  wage  arrears.  Teacher  strikes 
affected  nineteen  of  Russia's  eighty-nine  subnational  jurisdic- 
tions, and  only  fifteen  jurisdictions  did  not  owe  money  to  their 
teachers. 

Partly  because  of  low  budget  allocations  for  health,  in  1997 
new  reports  indicated  that  Russia's  health  crisis  was  worsening. 
Although  the  life  expectancy  for  males  increased  from  57.3 
years  to  59.6  years  between  1994  and  1996,  the  drinking  and 
smoking  habits  of  Russians,  together  with  continued  air  pollu- 
tion in  many  areas,  kept  mortality  rates  from  cardiac  and  circu- 
latory diseases  more  than  twice  as  high  as  those  in  the  United 
States.  The  incidence  of  infectious  and  parasitic  diseases  con- 
tinued to  increase.  Although  a  major  diphtheria  vaccination 
program  in  1995-96  radically  reduced  the  incidence  of  that 
disease,  tuberculosis  cases  increased  sharply,  especially  in  Rus- 
sia's prisons.  In  1997  the  minister  of  health  predicted  that  sex- 
ual promiscuity  and  drug  addiction  would  cause  800,000  new 
cases  of  HIV  infection  by  the  year  2000. 

Meanwhile,  the  official  government  population  prediction 
for  2010  called  for  a  decrease  of  7.3  million  people,  and  one 
Russian  expert  predicted  a  decrease  of  12  million  by  that  year. 
In  that  period,  fertility  was  expected  to  decline  because  of 
health  problems  among  women  of  childbearing  age  and 
because  of  the  overall  aging  of  the  population. 

The  overall  economic  situation  continued  to  be  overshad- 
owed by  the  Government's  inability  to  balance  its  budget.  Con- 
tinuing its  effort  to  improve  tax  collection — the  most  often 
cited  way  of  paying  overdue  state  salaries  and  pensions — in  May 
the  Chernomyrdin  government  submitted  a  new  tax  code  to 
the  State  Duma  for  approval.  Under  Yeltsin's  implicit  threat  to 
dissolve  the  Duma,  the  body  gave  preliminary  approval  to  the 


ciii 


code  in  June.  Meanwhile,  major  enterprises  continued  to  avoid 
full  tax  payment.  According  to  an  April  1997  State  Taxation 
Service  report,  Gazprom,  the  natural  gas  monopoly,  used  140 
separate  bank  accounts  to  shelter  its  assets.  Of  the  Govern- 
ment's list  of  eighty  leading  tax-evading  enterprises,  fifty-three 
were  in  the  fuel  and  energy  industry. 

Only  57  percent  of  projected  revenues  were  collected  in  the 
first  quarter  of  1997,  leaving  arrears  of  US$12  billion,  and  only 
63  percent  of  budgeted  expenditures  were  made.  By  May  the 
Government  owed  an  estimated  US$2.2  billion  in  pensions, 
US$2.3  billion  in  wages  to  state  workers,  and  US$1.4  billion  in 
child  support  allowances.  The  shortfall  also  reduced  economic 
investment,  which  in  the  first  half  of  1997  was  only  about  95 
percent  of  the  amount  invested  in  the  same  period  of  1996. 

In  response  to  the  shortfall,  Minister  of  Finance  Anatoliy 
Chubays  submitted  a  proposal  to  the  State  Duma  for  sequestra- 
tion of  allotted  funds,  warning  that  the  Government  could  not 
continue  functioning  if  major  cuts  were  not  made.  The  revi- 
sions called  for  reducing  spending  by  US$19  billion.  Despite 
strong  and  widespread  opposition  to  the  level  and  allocation  of 
the  cuts,  in  June  the  Duma  adjourned  for  its  summer  vacation 
without  submitting  an  alternative  plan. 

Meanwhile,  the  "capital  flight"  of  hard  currency  (see  Glos- 
sary) from  Russia  continued  at  a  rapid  rate  in  1997.  Interna- 
tional police  authorities  estimated  that  US$1  to  US$2  billion 
dollars  left  the  country  every  month,  much  of  it  connected 
with  illegal  activity  and  invested  abroad  by  Russian  emigres. 
Experts  identified  this  trend  as  a  sign  of  continuing  low  confi- 
dence in  the  domestic  economy. 

For  the  first  six  months  of  1997,  Russia's  GDP  shrank  by  0.2 
percent,  casting  doubt  on  Yeltsin's  July  assertion  that  the  econ- 
omy had  "turned  the  corner."  Positive  economic  news  of  early 
1997  included  the  continuing  reduction  of  inflation,  which 
reached  an  annual  rate  of  14.5  percent  in  June — the  lowest 
rate  since  Russia's  independence.  Also,  the  reorganization  of 
the  Government  in  March  caused  the  IMF  to  resume  monthly 
payments  on  Russia's  US$10  billion  loan,  which  had  been  sus- 
pended since  December.  The  World  Bank  also  announced  a 
two-year  loan  of  US$6  billion  to  help  pay  overdue  wages  and 
pensions. 

In  April  a  series  of  presidential  decrees  moved  Government 
policy  closer  to  privatization  in  some  sectors,  although  strong 
political  support  for  the  giant  monopolies  in  the  State  Duma 


civ 


guaranteed  that  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Boris  Nemtsov  would 
have  a  hard  struggle  in  breaking  them  down.  According  to  the 
new  privatization  goals,  Government  subsidies  of  housing  and 
municipal  services,  which  were  budgeted  at  US$27  billion  in 
1997,  were  to  be  reduced.  (The  average  Russian  paid  only  27 
percent  of  such  costs  in  1997.)  According  to  a  sliding  scale, 
subsidies  would  reach  zero  in  2003,  although  some  state  hous- 
ing support  would  remain  for  the  neediest  individuals.  In  the 
spring  of  1997,  local  increases  in  utility  and  housing  costs 
brought  demonstrations  in  St.  Petersburg,  and  Moscow's  pow- 
erful mayor,  Yuriy  Luzhkov,  objected  strongly  to  the  national 
proposal. 

Provisions  were  made  for  substantial  modification  of  the 
pricing  and/or  structure  of  the  state-controlled  electric  power 
industry  and  the  railroad  network,  and  Yeltsin  ordered  the  sale 
of  49  percent  of  the  telecommunications  giant  Svyazinvest,  divi- 
sion of  which  was  one  of  the  most  controversial  privatization 
issues.  In  July  25  percent  of  total  Svyazinvest  shares  were  won  at 
auction  by  a  group  including  Russia's  Uneximbank  and  Ger- 
man and  United  States  investors.  Because  of  the  backward  state 
of  Russia's  telephone  system,  telecommunications  is  consid- 
ered potentially  one  of  Russia's  largest  growth  industries.  The 
results  of  the  Svyazinvest  auction,  which  Boris  Nemtsov  touted 
as  fully  free  and  equitable,  set  off  loud  protests  from  the  power- 
ful business  interests  that  failed  to  acquire  shares.  The  issue 
threatened  to  split  the  large-business  bloc  that  had  supported 
Yeltsin  before  and  after  the  1996  election. 

Russia's  nineteen  railroad  companies,  which  accounted  for 
78  percent  of  freight  traffic  and  40  percent  of  passenger  traffic 
in  1997,  were  to  be  removed  from  direct  control  of  the  Ministry 
of  Transportation,  under  whose  management  fast-rising  rail- 
road fees  had  added  enormous  amounts  to  the  overhead  of 
railroad-dependent  industries  such  as  steel  and  coal.  At  the 
same  time,  rail  customers  owed  the  lines  an  estimated  US$1.1 
billion  in  1997,  and  the  companies'  equipment  was  in  desper- 
ate need  of  modernization. 

In  May  Yeltsin  announced  that  Gazprom  henceforth  would 
be  run  by  a  state  commission,  depriving  the  gas  monopoly  of 
the  financial  freedom  that  had  gained  it  billions  of  dollars  of 
untaxed  profits.  Yeltsin  already  had  stripped  Gazprom  of  its 
exclusive  right  to  develop  new  natural  gas  deposits,  and  the 
Government  now  expected  to  recover  much  of  Gazprom's 
unpaid  taxes  through  the  new  commission.  Prime  Minister 


cv 


Chernomyrdin  remained  a  protector  of  the  industry's  special 
status,  however. 

In  April  Yeltsin  renewed  his  appeal  for  Russia's  consumers  to 
"buy  Russian"  to  support  the  domestic  economy  in  the  face  of 
increased  consumption  of  imported  consumer  goods.  How- 
ever, Russian  manufacturers  faced  a  circular  dilemma:  consis- 
tently low  quality  kept  the  demand  for  Russian  goods  from 
expanding,  but  firms  were  unable  to  improve  quality  without 
new  profits  or  increasingly  scarce  government  subsidies. 

In  politics,  reformist  members  of  the  Kremlin's  younger  gen- 
eration advanced  in  Yeltsin's  Government  reorganization.  Boris 
Nemtsov,  thirty-seven,  gained  immediate  popularity  with  ordi- 
nary Russians  in  his  new  post  as  deputy  prime  minister  by 
attacking  monopolies  and  bureaucratic  corruption;  in  April 
Nemtsov  supplanted  Aleksandr  Lebed'  as  Russia's  most  trusted 
politician  in  two  nationwide  polls,  although  most  experts  called 
his  reform  program  virtually  impossible.  Experts  in  Russia 
already  were  speaking  of  Nemtsov  as  the  likely  presidential  can- 
didate of  the  "young  reformers"  in  2000.  In  April  forty-three- 
year-old  Sergey  Yastrzhembskiy,  who  had  gained  wide  approval 
as  Yeltsin's  press  secretary,  was  named  deputy  chief  of  staff  and 
foreign  policy  coordinator  while  retaining  his  previous  posi- 
tion. 

The  struggle  for  power  continued  at  the  echelon  of  govern- 
ment immediately  below  Yeltsin.  The  resignation  of  Cherno- 
myrdin protege  Petr  Rodionovfrom  his  post  as  Minister  of  Fuel 
and  Energy  deprived  the  prime  minister  of  his  most  important 
Government  ally.  However,  Chernomyrdin's  position  still  gave 
him  substantial  power  vis-a-vis  Chubays,  an  important  factor  in 
Yeltsin's  ongoing  policy  of  checking  the  ambitions  of  his  most 
powerful  subordinates.  (Experts  also  considered  the  presence 
of  Nemtsov  and  Valentin  Yumashev,  whom  Yeltsin  made  his

Human  rights  continued  to  have  strong  political  ramifica- 
tions in  mid-1997  when  both  houses  of  the  Federal  Assembly 
passed  a  law  restricting  the  activities  of  all  but  four  "traditional" 
religions.  The  Russian  Orthodox  Church  received  special  sta- 
tus; no  other  Christian  religions  were  included  in  the  "tradi- 
tional" category  The  law,  successor  to  legislation  introduced 
unsuccessfully  by  nationalist  and  communist  factions  earlier  in 
the  1990s,  attracted  strong  condemnation  from  the  Vatican 


cvi 


and  human  rights  groups  and  strong  support  from  the  Russian 
Orthodox  hierarchy  and  the  Communist  Party  of  Russia.  In 
July  Yeltsin  vetoed  the  law — which  experts  saw  as  evidence  of 
growing  anti-Western  sentiment  in  Russian  society — as  a  viola- 
tion of  the  constitution's  human  rights  guarantees.  The  fate  of 
that  law,  and  the  unresolved  disputes  between  the  executive 
and  legislative  branches  over  budget  cuts,  privatization,  mili- 
tary reform,  and  tax  collection  were  signs  that  Yeltsin's  new 
government  team  still  faced  complex  problems  in  their  reform 
campaign.

EACH  OF  THE  MANY  NATIONALITIES  of  Russia  has  a  sepa- 
rate history  and  complex  origins.  The  historical  origins  of  the 
Russian  state,  however,  are  chiefly  those  of  the  East  Slavs,  the 
ethnic  group  that  evolved  into  the  Russian,  Ukrainian,  and 
Belorussian  peoples.  The  major  pre-Soviet  states  of  the  East 
Slavs  were,  in  chronological  order,  medieval  Kievan  Rus',  Mus- 
covy, and  the  Russian  Empire.  Three  other  states — Poland, 
Lithuania,  and  the  Mongol  Empire — also  played  crucial  roles 
in  the  historical  development  of  Russia. 

The  first  East  Slavic  state,  Kievan  Rus',  emerged  along  the 
Dnepr  River  valley,  where  it  controlled  the  trade  route  between 
Scandinavia  and  the  Byzantine  Empire.  Kievan  Rus'  adopted 
Christianity  from  the  Byzantine  Empire  in  the  tenth  century, 
beginning  the  synthesis  of  Byzantine  and  Slavic  cultures  that 
defined  Russian  culture  for  the  next  thousand  years.  Kievan 
Rus'  ultimately  disintegrated  as  a  state  because  of  the  armed 
struggles  among  members  of  the  princely  family  that  collec- 
tively possessed  it.  Conquest  by  the  Mongols  in  the  thirteenth 
century  was  the  final  blow  in  this  disintegration;  subsequently, 
a  number  of  states  claimed  to  be  the  heirs  to  the  civilization 
and  dominant  position  of  Kievan  Rus'.  One  of  those  states, 
Muscovy,  was  a  predominantly  Russian  territory  located  at  the 
far  northern  edge  of  the  former  cultural  center.  Muscovy  grad- 
ually came  to  dominate  neighboring  territories,  forming  the 
basis  for  the  future  Russian  Empire. 

Muscovy  had  significant  impact  on  the  civilizations  that  fol- 
lowed, and  they  adopted  many  of  its  characteristics,  including 
the  subordination  of  the  individual  to  the  state.  This  idea  of 
the  dominant  state  derived  from  the  Slavic,  Mongol,  and  Byz- 
antine heritage  of  Muscovy,  and  it  later  emerged  in  the  unlim- 
ited power  of  the  tsar.  Both  individuals  and  institutions,  even 
the  Russian  Orthodox  Church,  were  subordinate  to  the  state  as 
it  was  represented  in  the  person  of  the  autocrat. 

A  second  characteristic  of  Russian  history  has  been  contin- 
ual territorial  expansion.  Beginning  with  Muscovy's  efforts  to 
consolidate  Russian  territory  as  Tatar  control  waned  in  the  fif- 
teenth century,  expansion  soon  went  beyond  ethnically  Rus- 
sian areas;  by  the  eighteenth  century,  the  principality  of 
Muscovy  had  become  the  huge  Russian  Empire,  stretching 
from  Poland  eastward  to  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Size  and  military

might  made  Russia  a  major  power,  but  its  acquisition  of  large 
territories  inhabited  by  non-Russian  peoples  began  an  endur- 
ing pattern  of  nationality  problems. 

Expansion  westward  sharpened  Russia's  awareness  of  its 
backwardness  and  shattered  the  isolation  in  which  the  initial 
stages  of  expansion  had  taken  place.  Muscovy  was  able  to 
develop  at  its  own  pace,  but  the  Russian  Empire  was  forced  to 
adopt  Western  technology  to  compete  militarily  in  Europe. 
Under  this  exigency,  Peter  the  Great  (r.  1682-1725)  and  subse- 
quent rulers  attempted  to  modernize  the  country.  Most  such 
efforts  struggled  with  indifferent  success  to  raise  Russia  to 
European  levels  of  technology  and  productivity.  The  technol- 
ogy that  Russia  adopted  brought  with  it  Western  cultural  and 
intellectual  currents  that  changed  the  direction  in  which  Rus- 
sian culture  developed.  As  Western  influence  continued,  native 
and  foreign  cultural  values  began  a  competition  that  survives 
in  vigorous  form  in  the  1990s.  The  nature  of  Russia's  relation- 
ship with  the  West  became  an  enduring  obsession  of  Russian 
intellectuals. 

Russia's  defeat  in  the  Crimean  War  (1853-56)  triggered 
another  attempt  at  modernization,  including  the  emancipation 
of  the  peasants  who  had  been  bound  to  the  land  in  the  system 
of  serfdom.  Despite  major  reforms  enacted  in  the  1860s,  how- 
ever, agriculture  remained  inefficient,  industrialization  pro- 
ceeded slowly,  and  new  social  problems  emerged.  In  addition 
to  masses  of  peasants  seeking  land  to  till,  a  new  class  of  indus- 
trial workers — the  proletariat — and  a  small  but  influential 
group  of  middle-class  professionals  were  dissatisfied  with  their 
positions.  The  non-Russian  populations  resented  periodic  offi- 
cial Russification  campaigns  and  struggled  for  autonomy.  Suc- 
cessive regimes  of  the  nineteenth  century  responded  to  such 
pressures  with  a  combination  of  halfhearted  reform  and 
repression,  but  no  tsar  was  willing  to  cede  autocratic  rule  or 
share  power.  Gradually,  the  monarch  and  the  state  system  that 
surrounded  him  became  isolated  from  the  rest  of  society.  In 
the  last  decades  of  the  nineteenth  century,  some  intellectuals 
became  more  radical,  and  groups  of  professional  revolutionar- 
ies emerged. 

In  spite  of  its  internal  problems,  Russia  continued  to  play  a 
major  role  in  international  politics.  However,  unexpected 
defeat  in  the  Russo-Japanese  War  of  1904-05  sparked  a  revolu- 
tion in  1905.  At  that  stage,  professionals,  workers,  peasants, 
minority  ethnic  groups,  and  soldiers  demanded  fundamental

reforms.  Reluctantly,  Nicholas  II  responded  to  the  first  of  Rus- 
sia's revolutions  by  granting  a  limited  constitution,  but  he 
increasingly  circumvented  its  democratic  clauses,  and  autoc- 
racy again  took  command  in  the  last  decade  of  the  tsarist  state. 
World  War  I  found  Russia  unready  for  combat  but  full  of  patri- 
otic zeal.  However,  as  the  government  proved  incompetent  and 
conditions  worsened,  war  weariness  and  revolutionary  pres- 
sures increased,  and  the  defenders  of  the  autocracy  grew  fewer. 

Early  History 

Many  ethnically  diverse  peoples  migrated  onto  the  East 
European  Plain,  but  the  East  Slavs  remained  and  gradually 
became  dominant.  Kievan  Rus',  the  first  East  Slavic  state, 
emerged  in  the  ninth  century  A.D.  and  developed  a  complex 
and  frequently  unstable  political  system  that  flourished  until 
the  thirteenth  century,  when  it  declined  abruptly.  Among  the 
lasting  achievements  of  Kievan  Rus1  are  the  introduction  of  a 
Slavic  variant  of  the  Eastern  Orthodox  religion  and  a  synthesis 
of  Byzantine  and  Slavic  cultures.  The  disintegration  of  Kievan 
Rus'  played  a  crucial  role  in  the  evolution  of  the  East  Slavs  into 
the  Russian,  Ukrainian,  and  Belorussian  peoples. 

The  Inhabitants  of  the  East  European  Plain 

Long  before  the  organization  of  Kievan  Rus1,  Iranian  and 
other  peoples  lived  in  the  area  of  present-day  Ukraine.  The 
best  known  of  those  groups  was  the  nomadic  Scythians,  who 
occupied  the  region  from  about  600  B.C.  to  200  B.C.  and 
whose  skill  in  warfare  and  horsemanship  is  legendary.  Between 
A.D.  100  and  A.D.  900,  Goths  and  nomadic  Huns,  Avars,  and 
Magyars  passed  through  the  region  in  their  migrations. 
Although  some  of  them  subjugated  the  Slavs  in  the  region, 
those  tribes  left  little  of  lasting  importance.  More  significant  in 
this  period  was  the  expansion  of  the  Slavs,  who  were  agricultur- 
ists and  beekeepers  as  well  as  hunters,  fishers,  herders,  and 
trappers.  By  A.D.  600,  the  Slavs  were  the  dominant  ethnic 
group  on  the  East  European  Plain. 

Little  is  known  of  the  origin  of  the  Slavs.  Philologists  and 
archaeologists  theorize  that  the  Slavs  settled  very  early  in  the 
Carpathian  Mountains  or  in  the  area  of  present-day  Belarus.  By 
A.D.  600,  they  had  split  linguistically  into  southern,  western, 
and  eastern  branches.  The  East  Slavs  settled  along  the  Dnepr 
River  in  what  is  now  Ukraine;  then  they  spread  northward  to 


5 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


the  northern  Volga  River  valley,  east  of  modern-day  Moscow, 
and  westward  to  the  basins  of  the  northern  Dnestr  and  the 
western  Bug  rivers,  in  present-day  Moldova  and  southern 
Ukraine.  In  the  eighth  and  ninth  centuries,  many  East  Slavic 
tribes  paid  tribute  to  the  Khazars,  a  Turkic-speaking  people 
who  adopted  Judaism  about  A.D.  740  and  lived  in  the  southern 
Volga  and  Caucasus  regions. 

The  East  Slavs  and  the  Varangians 

By  the  ninth  century,  Scandinavian  warriors  and  merchants, 
called  Varangians,  had  penetrated  the  East  Slavic  regions. 
According  to  the  Primary  Chronicle,  the  earliest  chronicle  of 
Kievan  Rus',  a  Varangian  named  Rurik  first  established  himself 
in  Novgorod,  just  south  of  modern-day  St.  Petersburg,  in  about 
860  before  moving  south  and  extending  his  authority  to  Kiev. 
The  chronicle  cites  Rurik  as  the  progenitor  of  a  dynasty  that 
ruled  in  Eastern  Europe  until  1598.  Another  Varangian,  Oleg, 
moved  south  from  Novgorod  to  expel  the  Khazars  from  Kiev 
and  founded  Kievan  Rus'  about  A.D.  880.  During  the  next 
thirty-five  years,  Oleg  subdued  the  various  East  Slavic  tribes.  In 
A.D.  907,  he  led  a  campaign  against  Constantinople,  and  in 
911  he  signed  a  commercial  treaty  with  the  Byzantine  Empire 
as  an  equal  partner.  The  new  Kievan  state  prospered  because  it 
controlled  the  trade  route  from  the  Baltic  Sea  to  the  Black  Sea 
and  because  it  had  an  abundant  supply  of  furs,  wax,  honey,  and 
slaves  for  export.  Historians  have  debated  the  role  of  the  Varan- 
gians in  the  establishment  of  Kievan  Rus'.  Most  Russian  histori- 
ans— especially  in  the  Soviet  era — have  stressed  the  Slavic 
influence  in  the  development  of  the  state.  Although  Slavic 
tribes  had  formed  their  own  regional  jurisdictions  by  860,  the 
Varangians  accelerated  the  crystallization  of  Kievan  Rus'. 

The  Golden  Age  of  Kiev 

The  region  of  Kiev  dominated  the  state  of  Kievan  Rus'  for 
the  next  two  centuries  (see  fig.  2).  The  grand  prince  of  Kiev 
controlled  the  lands  around  the  city,  and  his  theoretically  sub- 
ordinate relatives  ruled  in  other  cities  and  paid  him  tribute. 
The  zenith  of  the  state's  power  came  during  the  reigns  of 
Prince  Vladimir  (r.  978-1015)  and  Prince  Yaroslav  (the  Wise;  r. 
1019-54).  Both  rulers  continued  the  steady  expansion  of 
Kievan  Rus'  that  had  begun  under  Oleg.  To  enhance  their 
power,  Vladimir  married  the  sister  of  the  Byzantine  emperor, 
and  Yaroslav  arranged  marriages  for  his  sister  and  three  daugh-

ters  to  the  kings  of  Poland,  France,  Hungary,  and  Norway. 
Vladimir's  greatest  achievement  was  the  Christianization  of 
Kievan  Rus',  a  process  that  began  in  988.  He  built  the  first  great 
edifice  of  Kievan  Rus',  the  Desyatinnaya  Church  in  Kiev.  Yaro- 
slav  promulgated  the  first  East  Slavic  law  code,  Rus'ka  pravda 
(Justice  of  Rus');  built  cathedrals  named  for  St.  Sophia  in  Kiev 
and  Novgorod;  patronized  local  clergy  and  monasticism;  and  is 
said  to  have  founded  a  school  system.  Yaroslav's  sons  developed 
Kiev's  great  Peshcherskiy  monastyr'  (Monastery  of  the  Caves), 
which  functioned  in  Kievan  Rus'  as  an  ecclesiastical  academy. 

Vladimir's  choice  of  Eastern  Orthodoxy  reflected  his  close 
personal  ties  with  Constantinople,  which  dominated  the  Black 
Sea  and  hence  trade  on  Kiev's  most  vital  commercial  route,  the 
Dnepr  River.  Adherence  to  the  Eastern  Orthodox  Church  had 
long-range  political,  cultural,  and  religious  consequences.  The 
church  had  a  liturgy  written  in  Cyrillic  (see  Glossary)  and  a  cor- 
pus of  translations  from  the  Greek  that  had  been  produced  for 
the  South  Slavs.  The  existence  of  this  literature  facilitated  the 
East  Slavs'  conversion  to  Christianity  and  introduced  them  to 
rudimentary  Greek  philosophy,  science,  and  historiography 
without  the  necessity  of  learning  Greek.  In  contrast,  educated 
people  in  medieval  Western  and  Central  Europe  learned  Latin. 
Because  the  East  Slavs  learned  neither  Greek  nor  Latin,  they 
were  isolated  from  Byzantine  culture  as  well  as  from  the  Euro- 
pean cultures  of  their  neighbors  to  the  west. 

In  the  centuries  that  followed  the  state's  foundation,  Rurik's 
purported  descendants  shared  power  over  Kievan  Rus'. 
Princely  succession  moved  from  elder  to  younger  brother  and 
from  uncle  to  nephew,  as  well  as  from  father  to  son.  Junior 
members  of  the  dynasty  usually  began  their  official  careers  as 
rulers  of  a  minor  district,  progressed  to  more  lucrative  princi- 
palities, and  then  competed  for  the  coveted  throne  of  Kiev. 

In  the  eleventh  and  twelfth  centuries,  the  princes  and  their 
retinues,  which  were  a  mixture  of  Varangian  and  Slavic  elites 
and  small  Finno-Ugric  and  Turkic  elements,  dominated  the 
society  of  Kievan  Rus'.  Leading  soldiers  and  officials  received 
income  and  land  from  the  princes  in  return  for  their  political 
and  military  services.  Kievan  society  lacked  the  class  institu- 
tions and  autonomous  towns  that  were  typical  of  West  Euro- 
pean feudalism.  Nevertheless,  urban  merchants,  artisans,  and 
laborers  sometimes  exercised  political  influence  through  a  city 
assembly,  the  veche,  which  included  all  the  adult  males  in  the 
population.  In  some  cases,  the  veche  either  made  agreements

with  their  rulers  or  expelled  them  and  invited  others  to  take 
their  place.  At  the  bottom  of  society  was  a  small  stratum  of 
slaves.  More  important  was  a  class  of  tribute-paying  peasants, 
who  owed  labor  duty  to  the  princes;  the  widespread  personal 
serfdom  characteristic  of  Western  Europe  did  not  exist  in 
Kievan  Rus',  however. 

The  Rise  of  Regional  Centers 

Kievan  Rus'  was  not  able  to  maintain  its  position  as  a  power-

ful  and  prosperous  state,  in  part  because  of  the  amalgamation 
of  disparate  lands  under  the  control  of  a  ruling  clan.  As  the 
members  of  that  clan  became  more  numerous,  they  identified 
themselves  with  regional  interests  rather  than  with  the  larger 
patrimony.  Thus,  the  princes  fought  among  themselves,  fre- 
quently forming  alliances  with  outside  groups  such  as  the 
Polovtsians,  Poles,  and  Hungarians.  The  Crusades  brought  a 
shift  in  European  trade  routes  that  accelerated  the  decline  of 
Kievan  Rus'.  In  1204  the  forces  of  the  Fourth  Crusade  sacked 
Constantinople,  making  the  Dnepr  trade  route  marginal.  As  it 
declined,  Kievan  Rus'  splintered  into  many  principalities  and 
several  large  regional  centers.  The  inhabitants  of  those 
regional  centers  then  evolved  into  three  nationalities:  Ukraini- 
ans in  the  southeast  and  southwest,  Belorussians  in  the  north- 
west, and  Russians  in  the  north  and  northeast. 

In  the  north,  the  Republic  of  Novgorod  prospered  as  part  of 
Kievan  Rus'  because  it  controlled  trade  routes  from  the  Volga 
River  to  the  Baltic  Sea.  As  Kievan  Rus'  declined,  Novgorod 
became  more  independent.  A  local  oligarchy  ruled  Novgorod; 
major  government  decisions  were  made  by  a  town  assembly, 
which  also  elected  a  prince  as  the  city's  military  leader.  In  the 
twelfth  century,  Novgorod  acquired  its  own  archbishop,  a  sign 
of  increased  importance  and  political  independence.  In  its 
political  structure  and  mercantile  activities,  Novgorod  resem- 
bled the  north  European  towns  of  the  Hanseatic  League,  the 
prosperous  alliance  that  dominated  the  commercial  activity  of 
the  Baltic  region  between  the  thirteenth  and  seventeenth  cen- 
turies, more  than  the  other  principalities  of  Kievan  Rus'. 

In  the  northeast,  East  Slavs  colonized  the  territory  that  even- 
tually became  Muscovy  by  intermingling  with  the  Finno-Ugric 
tribes  already  occupying  the  area.  The  city  of  Rostov  was  the 
oldest  center  of  the  northeast,  but  it  was  supplanted  first  by 
Suzdal'  and  then  by  the  city  of  Vladimir.  By  the  twelfth  century, 
the  combined  principality  of  Vladimir-Suzdal'  had  become  a 
major  power  in  Kievan  Rus1. 

In  1169  Prince  Andrey  Bogolyubskiy  of  Vladimir-Suzdal' 
dealt  a  severe  blow  to  the  waning  power  of  Kievan  Rus'  when 
his  armies  sacked  the  city  of  Kiev.  Prince  Andrey  then  installed 
his  younger  brother  to  rule  in  Kiev  and  continued  to  rule  his 
realm  from  Suzdal'.  Thus,  political  power  shifted  to  the  north- 
east, away  from  Kiev,  in  the  second  half  of  the  twelfth  century. 
In  1299,  in  the  wake  of  the  Mongol  invasion,  the  metropolitan

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  Orthodox  Church  moved  to  the  city  of  Vladimir,  and 
Vladimir-Suzdal'  replaced  Kievan  Rus1  as  the  religious  center. 

To  the  southwest,  the  principality  of  Galicia-Volhynia  had 
highly  developed  trade  relations  with  its  Polish,  Hungarian, 
and  Lithuanian  neighbors  and  emerged  as  another  successor 
to  Kievan  Rus1.  In  the  early  thirteenth  century,  Prince  Roman 
Mstislavich  united  the  two  previously  separate  principalities, 
conquered  Kiev,  and  assumed  the  title  of  grand  duke  of  Kievan 
Rus'.  His  son,  Prince  Daniil  (Danylo;  r.  1238-64)  was  the  first 
ruler  of  Kievan  Rus'  to  accept  a  crown  from  the  Roman  papacy, 
apparently  doing  so  without  breaking  with  Orthodoxy.  Early  in 
the  fourteenth  century,  the  patriarch  of  the  Orthodox  Church 
in  Constantinople  granted  the  rulers  of  Galicia-Volhynia  a  met- 
ropolitan to  compensate  for  the  move  of  the  Kievan  metropoli- 
tan to  Vladimir. 

However,  a  long  and  unsuccessful  struggle  against  the  Mon- 
gols combined  with  internal  opposition  to  the  prince  and  for- 
eign intervention  to  weaken  Galicia-Volhynia.  With  the  end  of 
the  Mstislavich  Dynasty  in  the  mid-fourteenth  century,  Galicia- 
Volhynia  ceased  to  exist;  Lithuania  took  Volhynia,  and  Poland 
annexed  Galicia. 

The  Mongol  Invasion 

As  it  was  undergoing  fragmentation,  Kievan  Rus'  faced  its 
greatest  threat  from  invading  Mongols.  In  1223  an  army  from 
Kievan  Rus',  together  with  a  force  of  Turkic  Polovtsians,  faced  a 
Mongol  raiding  party  at  the  Kalka  River.  The  Kievan  alliance 
was  defeated  soundly.  Then,  in  1237-38,  a  much  larger  Mongol 
force  overran  much  of  Kievan  Rus'.  In  1240  the  Mongols 
sacked  the  city  of  Kiev  and  then  moved  west  into  Poland  and 
Hungary  Of  the  principalities  of  Kievan  Rus',  only  the  Repub- 
lic of  Novgorod  escaped  occupation,  but  it  paid  tribute  to  the 
Mongols.  One  branch  of  the  Mongol  force  withdrew  to  Saray 
on  the  lower  Volga  River,  establishing  the  Golden  Horde  (see 
Glossary).  From  Saray  the  Golden  Horde  Mongols  ruled 
Kievan  Rus1  indirectly  through  their  princes  and  tax  collectors. 

The  impact  of  the  Mongol  invasion  on  the  territories  of 
Kievan  Rus'  was  uneven.  Centers  such  as  Kiev  never  recovered 
from  the  devastation  of  the  initial  attack.  The  Republic  of 
Novgorod  continued  to  prosper,  however,  and  a  new  entity,  the 
city  of  Moscow,  began  to  flourish  under  the  Mongols.  Although 
a  Russian  army  defeated  the  Golden  Horde  at  Kulikovo  in 
1380,  Mongol  domination  of  the  Russian-inhabited  territories, 


10

along  with  demands  of  tribute  from  Russian  princes,  continued 
until  about  1480. 

Historians  have  debated  the  long-term  influence  of  Mongol 
rule  on  Russian  society.  The  Mongols  have  been  blamed  for  the 
destruction  of  Kievan  Rus',  the  breakup  of  the  "Russian" 
nationality  into  three  components,  and  the  introduction  of  the 
concept  of  "oriental  despotism"  into  Russia.  But  most  histori- 
ans agree  that  Kievan  Rus'  was  not  a  homogeneous  political, 
cultural,  or  ethnic  entity  and  that  the  Mongols  merely  acceler- 
ated a  fragmentation  that  had  begun  before  the  invasion.  His- 
torians also  credit  the  Mongol  regime  with  an  important  role 
in  the  development  of  Muscovy  as  a  state.  Under  Mongol  occu- 
pation, for  example,  Muscovy  developed  its  postal  road  net- 
work, census,  fiscal  system,  and  military  organization. 

Kievan  Rus'  also  left  a  powerful  legacy.  The  leader  of  the 
Rurik  Dynasty  united  a  large  territory  inhabited  by  East  Slavs 
into  an  important,  albeit  unstable,  state.  After  Vladimir 
accepted  Eastern  Orthodoxy,  Kievan  Rus'  came  together  under 
a  church  structure  and  developed  a  Byzantine-Slavic  synthesis 
in  culture,  statecraft,  and  the  arts.  On  the  northeastern  periph- 
ery of  Kievan  Rus',  those  traditions  were  adapted  to  form  the 
Russian  autocratic  state. 

Muscovy 

The  development  of  the  Russian  state  can  be  traced  from 
Vladimir-Suzdal'  through  Muscovy  to  the  Russian  Empire.  Mus- 
covy drew  people  and  wealth  to  the  northeastern  periphery  of 
Kievan  Rus';  established  trade  links  to  the  Baltic  Sea,  the  White 
Sea,  and  the  Caspian  Sea  and  to  Siberia;  and  created  a  highly 
centralized  and  autocratic  political  system.  Muscovite  political 
traditions,  therefore,  exerted  a  powerful  influence  on  Russian 
society. 

The  Rise  of  Muscovy 

When  the  Mongols  invaded  the  lands  of  Kievan  Rus1,  Mos- 
cow was  an  insignificant  trading  outpost  in  the  principality  of 
Vladimir-Suzdal'.  The  outpost's  remote,  forested  location 
offered  some  security  from  Mongol  attack  and  occupation,  and 
a  number  of  rivers  provided  access  to  the  Baltic  and  Black  seas 
and  to  the  Caucasus  region.  More  important  to  Moscow's  devel- 
opment in  what  became  the  state  of  Muscovy,  however,  was  its 
rule  by  a  series  of  princes  who  were  ambitious,  determined,

and  lucky.  The  first  ruler  of  the  principality  of  Muscovy,  Daniil 
Aleksandrovich  (d.  1303),  secured  the  principality  for  his 
branch  of  the  Rurik  Dynasty.  His  son,  Ivan  I  (r.  1325-40), 
known  as  Ivan  Kalita  ("Money  Bags"),  obtained  the  title  "Grand 
Prince  of  Vladimir"  from  his  Mongol  overlords.  He  cooperated 
closely  with  the  Mongols  and  collected  tribute  from  other  Rus- 
sian principalities  on  their  behalf.  This  relationship  enabled 
Ivan  to  gain  regional  ascendancy,  particularly  over  Muscovy's 
chief  rival,  the  northern  city  of  Tver'.  In  1327  the  Orthodox 
metropolitan  transferred  his  residency  from  Vladimir  to  Mos- 
cow, further  enhancing  the  prestige  of  the  new  principality. 

In  the  fourteenth  century,  the  grand  princes  of  Muscovy 
began  gathering  Russian  lands  to  increase  the  population  and 
wealth  under  their  rule  (see  table  2,  Appendix).  The  most  suc- 
cessful practitioner  of  this  process  was  Ivan  III  (the  Great;  r. 
1462-1505),  who  conquered  Novgorod  in  1478  and  Tver'  in 
1485.  Muscovy  gained  full  sovereignty  over  the  ethnically  Rus- 
sian lands  in  1480  when  Mongol  overlordship  ended  officially, 
and  by  the  beginning  of  the  sixteenth  century  virtually  all  those 
lands  were  united.  Through  inheritance,  Ivan  obtained  part  of 
the  province  of  Ryazan',  and  the  princes  of  Rostov  and  Yaro- 
slavl' voluntarily  subordinated  themselves  to  him.  The  north- 
western city  of  Pskov  remained  independent  in  this  period,  but 
Ivan's  son,  Vasiliy  III  (r.  1505-33),  later  conquered  it. 

Ivan  III  was  the  first  Muscovite  ruler  to  use  the  titles  of  tsar 
and  "Ruler  of  all  Rus'."  Ivan  competed  with  his  powerful  north- 
western rival  Lithuania  for  control  over  some  of  the  semi-inde- 
pendent former  principalities  of  Kievan  Rus'  in  the  upper 
Dnepr  and  Donets  river  basins.  Through  the  defections  of 
some  princes,  border  skirmishes,  and  a  long,  inconclusive  war 
with  Lithuania  that  ended  only  in  1503,  Ivan  III  was  able  to 
push  westward,  and  Muscovy  tripled  in  size  under  his  rule. 

The  Evolution  of  the  Russian  Aristocracy 

Internal  consolidation  accompanied  outward  expansion  of 
the  state.  By  the  fifteenth  century,  the  rulers  of  Muscovy  con- 
sidered the  entire  Russian  territory  their  collective  property. 
Various  semi-independent  princes  still  claimed  specific  territo- 
ries, but  Ivan  III  forced  the  lesser  princes  to  acknowledge  the 
grand  prince  of  Muscovy  and  his  descendants  as  unquestioned 
rulers  with  control  over  military,  judicial,  and  foreign  affairs. 

Gradually,  the  Muscovite  ruler  emerged  as  a  powerful,  auto- 
cratic ruler,  a  tsar.  By  assuming  that  title,  the  Muscovite  prince 


12 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

underscored  that  he  was  a  major  ruler  or  emperor  on  a  par 
with  the  emperor  of  the  Byzantine  Empire  or  the  Mongol 
khan.  Indeed,  after  Ivan  Ill's  marriage  to  Sophia  Paleologue, 
the  niece  of  the  last  Byzantine  emperor,  the  Muscovite  court 
adopted  Byzantine  terms,  rituals,  titles,  and  emblems  such  as 
the  double-headed  eagle.  At  first,  the  term  autocrat  connoted 
only  the  literal  meaning  of  an  independent  ruler,  but  in  the 
reign  of  Ivan  IV  (r.  1533-84)  it  came  to  mean  unlimited  rule. 
Ivan  IV  was  crowned  tsar  and  thus  was  recognized,  at  least  by 
the  Orthodox  Church,  as  emperor.  An  Orthodox  monk  had 
claimed  that,  once  Constantinople  had  fallen  to  the  Ottoman 
Empire  in  1453,  the  Muscovite  tsar  was  the  only  legitimate 
Orthodox  ruler  and  that  Moscow  was  the  Third  Rome  because 
it  was  the  final  successor  to  Rome  and  Constantinople,  the  cen- 
ters of  Christianity  in  earlier  periods.  That  concept  was  to  reso- 
nate in  the  self-image  of  Russians  in  future  centuries. 

Ivan  IV 

The  development  of  the  tsar's  autocratic  powers  reached  a 
peak  during  the  reign  of  Ivan  IV,  and  he  became  known  as  the 
Terrible  (his  Russian  epithet,  groznyy,  means  threatening  or 
dreaded).  Ivan  strengthened  the  position  of  the  tsar  to  an 
unprecedented  degree,  demonstrating  the  risks  of  unbridled 
power  in  the  hands  of  a  mentally  unstable  individual.  Although 
apparently  intelligent  and  energetic,  Ivan  suffered  from  bouts 
of  paranoia  and  depression,  and  his  rule  was  punctuated  by 
acts  of  extreme  violence. 

Ivan  IV  became  grand  prince  of  Muscovy  in  1533  at  the  age 
of  three.  Various  factions  of  the  boyars  (see  Glossary)  com- 
peted for  control  of  the  regency  until  Ivan  assumed  the  throne 
in  1547.  Reflecting  Muscovy's  new  imperial  claims,  Ivan's  coro- 
nation as  tsar  was  an  elaborate  ritual  modeled  after  those  of  the 
Byzantine  emperors.  With  the  continuing  assistance  of  a  group 
of  boyars,  Ivan  began  his  reign  with  a  series  of  useful  reforms. 
In  the  1550s,  he  promulgated  a  new  law  code,  revamped  the 
military,  and  reorganized  local  government.  These  reforms 
undoubtedly  were  intended  to  strengthen  the  state  in  the  face 
of  continuous  warfare. 

During  the  late  1550s,  Ivan  developed  a  hostility  toward  his 
advisers,  the  government,  and  the  boyars.  Historians  have  not 
determined  whether  policy  differences,  personal  animosities, 
or  mental  imbalance  cause  his  wrath.  In  1565  he  divided  Mus- 
covy into  two  parts:  his  private  domain  and  the  public  realm. 


13 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

For  his  private  domain,  Ivan  chose  some  of  the  most  prosper- 
ous and  important  districts  of  Muscovy.  In  these  areas,  Ivan's 
agents  attacked  boyars,  merchants,  and  even  common  people, 
summarily  executing  some  and  confiscating  land  and  posses- 
sions. Thus  began  a  decade  of  terror  in  Muscovy.  As  a  result  of 
this  policy,  called  the  oprichnina,  Ivan  broke  the  economic  and 
political  power  of  the  leading  boyar  families,  thereby  destroy- 
ing precisely  those  persons  who  had  built  up  Muscovy  and  were 
the  most  capable  of  administering  it.  Trade  diminished,  and 
peasants,  faced  with  mounting  taxes  and  threats  of  violence, 
began  to  leave  Muscovy.  Efforts  to  curtail  the  mobility  of  the 
peasants  by  tying  them  to  their  land  brought  Muscovy  closer  to 
legal  serfdom.  In  1572  Ivan  finally  abandoned  the  practices  of 
the  oprichnina. 

Despite  the  domestic  turmoil  of  Ivan's  late  period,  Muscovy 
continued  to  wage  wars  and  to  expand.  Ivan  defeated  and 
annexed  the  Kazan'  Khanate  on  the  middle  Volga  in  1552  and 
later  the  Astrakhan'  Khanate,  where  the  Volga  meets  the  Cas- 
pian Sea.  These  victories  gave  Muscovy  access  to  the  entire 
Volga  River  and  to  Central  Asia.  Muscovy's  eastward  expansion 
encountered  relatively  little  resistance.  In  1581  the  Stroganov 
merchant  family,  interested  in  fur  trade,  hired  a  Cossack  (see 
Glossary)  leader,  Yermak,  to  lead  an  expedition  into  western 
Siberia.  Yermak  defeated  the  Siberian  Khanate  and  claimed 
the  territories  west  of  the  Ob'  and  Irtysh  rivers  for  Muscovy  (see 
fig.  3). 

Expanding  to  the  northwest  toward  the  Baltic  Sea  proved  to 
be  much  more  difficult.  In  1558  Ivan  invaded  Livonia,  eventu- 
ally embroiling  him  in  a  twenty-five-year  war  against  Poland, 
Lithuania,  Sweden,  and  Denmark.  Despite  occasional  suc- 
cesses, Ivan's  army  was  pushed  back,  and  Muscovy  failed  to 
secure  a  coveted  position  on  the  Baltic  Sea.  The  war  drained 
Muscovy.  Some  historians  believe  that  Ivan  initiated  the  oprich- 
nina to  mobilize  resources  for  the  war  and  to  quell  opposition 
to  it.  Regardless  of  the  reason,  Ivan's  domestic  and  foreign  pol- 
icies had  a  devastating  effect  on  Muscovy,  and  they  led  to  a 
period  of  social  struggle  and  civil  war,  the  so-called  Time  of 
Troubles  (Smutnoye  vremya,  1598-1613). 

The  Time  of  Troubles 

Ivan  IV  was  succeeded  by  his  son  Fedor,  who  was  mentally 
deficient.  Actual  power  went  to  Fedor's  brother-in-law,  the 
boyar  Boris  Godunov.  Perhaps  the  most  important  event  of 


14 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

Fedor's  reign  was  the  proclamation  of  the  patriarchate  of  Mos- 
cow in  1589.  The  creation  of  the  patriarchate  climaxed  the  evo- 
lution of  a  separate  and  totally  independent  Russian  Orthodox 
Church. 

In  1598  Fedor  died  without  an  heir,  ending  the  Rurik 
Dynasty.  Boris  Godunov  then  convened  a  zemskiy  sobor,  a 
national  assembly  of  boyars,  church  officials,  and  commoners, 
which  proclaimed  him  tsar,  although  various  boyar  factions 
refused  to  recognize  the  decision.  Widespread  crop  failures 
caused  a  famine  between  1601  and  1603,  and  during  the  ensu- 
ing discontent,  a  man  emerged  who  claimed  to  be  Dmitriy, 
Ivan  IV's  son  who  had  died  in  1591.  This  pretender  to  the 
throne,  who  came  to  be  known  as  the  first  False  Dmitriy,  gained 
support  in  Poland  and  marched  to  Moscow,  gathering  follow- 
ers among  the  boyars  and  other  elements  as  he  went.  Histori- 
ans speculate  that  Godunov  would  have  weathered  this  crisis, 
but  he  died  in  1605.  As  a  result,  the  first  False  Dmitriy  entered 
Moscow  and  was  crowned  tsar  that  year,  following  the  murder 
of  Tsar  Fedor  II,  Godunov's  son. 

Subsequently,  Muscovy  entered  a  period  of  continuous 
chaos.  The  Time  of  Troubles  included  a  civil  war  in  which  a 
struggle  over  the  throne  was  complicated  by  the  machinations 
of  rival  boyar  factions,  the  intervention  of  regional  powers 
Poland  and  Sweden,  and  intense  popular  discontent.  The  first 
False  Dmitriy  and  his  Polish  garrison  were  overthrown,  and  a 
boyar,  Vasiliy  Shuyskiy,  was  proclaimed  tsar  in  1606.  In  his 
attempt  to  retain  the  throne,  Shuyskiy  allied  himself  with  the 
Swedes.  A  second  False  Dmitriy,  allied  with  the  Poles, 
appeared.  In  1610  that  heir  apparent  was  proclaimed  tsar,  and 
the  Poles  occupied  Moscow.  The  Polish  presence  led  to  a  patri- 
otic revival  among  the  Russians,  and  a  new  army,  financed  by 
northern  merchants  and  blessed  by  the  Orthodox  Church, 
drove  the  Poles  out.  In  1613  a  new  zemskiy  sobor  proclaimed  the 
boyar  Mikhail  Romanov  as  tsar,  beginning  the  300-year  reign  of 
the  Romanov  family. 

Muscovy  was  in  chaos  for  more  than  a  decade,  but  the  insti- 
tution of  the  autocracy  remained  intact.  Despite  the  tsar's  per- 
secution of  the  boyars,  the  townspeople's  dissatisfaction,  and 
the  gradual  enserfment  of  the  peasantry,  efforts  at  restricting 
the  power  of  the  tsar  were  only  halfhearted.  Finding  no  institu- 
tional alternative  to  the  autocracy,  discontented  Russians  ral- 
lied behind  various  pretenders  to  the  throne.  During  that 
period,  the  goal  of  political  activity  was  to  gain  influence  over 


15 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 


the  sitting  autocrat  or  to  place  one's  own  candidate  on  the 
throne.  The  boyars  fought  among  themselves,  the  lower  classes 
revolted  blindly,  and  foreign  armies  occupied  the  Kremlin  (see 
Glossary)  in  Moscow,  prompting  many  to  accept  tsarist  absolut- 
ism as  a  necessary  means  to  restoring  order  and  unity  in  Mus- 
covy. 

The  Romanovs 

The  immediate  task  of  the  new  dynasty  was  to  restore  order. 
Fortunately  for  Muscovy,  its  major  enemies,  Poland  and  Swe- 
den, were  engaged  in  a  bitter  conflict  with  each  other,  which 
provided  Muscovy  the  opportunity  to  make  peace  with  Sweden 
in  1617  and  to  sign  a  truce  with  Poland  in  1619.  After  an  unsuc- 
cessful attempt  to  regain  the  city  of  Smolensk  from  Poland  in 
1632,  Muscovy  made  peace  with  Poland  in  1634.  Polish  king 
Wladyslaw  IV,  whose  father  and  predecessor  Sigismund  III  had 
manipulated  his  nominal  selection  as  tsar  of  Muscovy  during 
the  Time  of  Troubles,  renounced  all  claims  to  the  title  as  a  con- 
dition of  the  peace  treaty. 

The  early  Romanovs  were  weak  rulers.  Under  Mikhail,  state 
affairs  were  in  the  hands  of  the  tsar's  father,  Filaret,  who  in 
1619  became  patriarch  of  the  Orthodox  Church.  Later, 
Mikhail's  son  Aleksey  (r.  1645-76)  relied  on  a  boyar,  Boris 
Morozov,  to  run  his  government.  Morozov  abused  his  position 
by  exploiting  the  populace,  and  in  1648  Aleksey  dismissed  him 
in  the  wake  of  a  popular  uprising  in  Moscow. 

The  autocracy  survived  the  Time  of  Troubles  and  the  rule  of 
weak  or  corrupt  tsars  because  of  the  strength  of  the  govern- 
ment's central  bureaucracy.  Government  functionaries  contin- 
ued to  serve,  regardless  of  the  ruler's  legitimacy  or  the  boyar 
faction  controlling  the  throne.  In  the  seventeenth  century,  the 
bureaucracy  expanded  dramatically.  The  number  of  govern- 
ment departments  (prikazy;  sing.,  prikaz)  increased  from  twenty- 
two  in  1613  to  eighty  by  mid-century.  Although  the  depart- 
ments often  had  overlapping  and  conflicting  jurisdictions,  the 
central  government,  through  provincial  governors,  was  able  to 
control  and  regulate  all  social  groups,  as  well  as  trade,  manu- 
facturing, and  even  the  Orthodox  Church. 

The  comprehensive  legal  code  introduced  in  1649  illustrates 
the  extent  of  state  control  over  Russian  society.  By  that  time, 
the  boyars  had  largely  merged  with  the  elite  bureaucracy,  who 
were  obligatory  servitors  of  the  state,  to  form  a  new  nobility, 
the  dvoryanstvo.  The  state  required  service  from  both  the  old 


17 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

and  the  new  nobility,  primarily  in  the  military.  In  return,  they 
received  land  and  peasants.  In  the  preceding  century,  the  state 
had  gradually  curtailed  peasants'  rights  to  move  from  one  land- 
lord to  another;  the  1649  code  officially  attached  peasants  to 
their  domicile.  The  state  fully  sanctioned  serfdom,  and  run- 
away peasants  became  state  fugitives.  Landlords  had  complete 
power  over  their  peasants  and  bought,  sold,  traded,  and  mort- 
gaged them.  Peasants  living  on  state-owned  land,  however,  were 
not  considered  serfs.  They  were  organized  into  communes, 
which  were  responsible  for  taxes  and  other  obligations.  Like 
serfs,  however,  state  peasants  were  attached  to  the  land  they 
farmed.  Middle-class  urban  tradesmen  and  craftsmen  were 
assessed  taxes,  and,  like  the  serfs,  they  were  forbidden  to 
change  residence.  All  segments  of  the  population  were  subject 
to  military  levy  and  to  special  taxes.  By  chaining  much  of  Mus- 
covite society  to  specific  domiciles,  the  legal  code  of  1649  cur- 
tailed movement  and  subordinated  the  people  to  the  interests 
of  the  state. 

Under  this  code,  increased  state  taxes  and  regulations  exac- 
erbated the  social  discontent  that  had  been  simmering  since 
the  Time  of  Troubles.  In  the  1650s  and  1660s,  the  number  of 
peasant  escapes  increased  dramatically.  A  favorite  refuge  was 
the  Don  River  region,  domain  of  the  Don  Cossacks.  A  major 
uprising  occurred  in  the  Volga  region  in  1670  and  1671.  Stenka 
Razin,  a  Cossack  who  was  from  the  Don  River  region,  led  a 
revolt  that  drew  together  wealthy  Cossacks  who  were  well  estab- 
lished in  the  region  and  escaped  serfs  seeking  free  land.  The 
unexpected  uprising  swept  up  the  Volga  River  valley  and  even 
threatened  Moscow.  Tsarist  troops  finally  defeated  the  rebels 
after  they  had  occupied  major  cities  along  the  Volga  in  an  oper- 
ation whose  panache  captured  the  imaginations  of  later  gener- 
ations of  Russians.  Razin  was  publicly  tortured  and  executed. 

Expansion  and  Westernization 

Muscovy  continued  its  territorial  growth  through  the  seven- 
teenth century.  In  the  southwest,  it  acquired  eastern  Ukraine, 
which  had  been  under  Polish  rule.  The  Ukrainian  Cossacks, 
warriors  organized  in  military  formations,  lived  in  the  frontier 
areas  bordering  Poland,  the  Tatar  lands,  and  Muscovy. 
Although  they  had  served  in  the  Polish  army  as  mercenaries, 
the  Ukrainian  Cossacks  remained  fiercely  independent  and 
staged  a  number  of  uprisings  against  the  Poles.  In  1648  most  of 
Ukrainian  society  joined  the  Cossacks  in  a  revolt  because  of  the 


18 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

political,  social,  religious,  and  ethnic  oppression  suffered 
under  Polish  rule.  After  the  Ukrainians  had  thrown  off  Polish 
rule,  they  needed  military  help  to  maintain  their  position.  In 
1654  the  Ukrainian  leader,  Bogdan  Khmel'nitskiy  (Bohdan 
Khmer nyts'kyy),  offered  to  place  Ukraine  under  the  protection 
of  the  Muscovite  tsar,  Aleksey  I,  rather  than  under  the  Polish 
king.  Aleksey's  acceptance  of  this  offer,  which  was  ratified  in 
the  Treaty  of  Pereyaslavl',  led  to  a  protracted  war  between 
Poland  and  Muscovy.  The  Treaty  of  Andrusovo,  which  ended 
the  war  in  1667,  split  Ukraine  along  the  Dnepr  River,  reuniting 
the  western  sector  with  Poland  and  leaving  the  eastern  sector 
self-governing  under  the  suzerainty  of  the  tsar. 

In  the  east,  Muscovy  had  obtained  western  Siberia  in  the  six- 
teenth century.  From  this  base,  merchants,  traders,  and  explor- 
ers pushed  eastward  from  the  Ob'  River  to  the  Yenisey  River, 
then  to  the  Lena  River.  By  the  middle  of  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury, Muscovites  had  reached  the  Amur  River  and  the  outskirts 
of  the  Chinese  Empire.  After  a  period  of  conflict  with  the  Man- 
chu  Dynasty,  Muscovy  made  peace  with  China  in  1689.  By  the 
Treaty  of  Nerchinsk,  Muscovy  ceded  its  claims  to  the  Amur  Val- 
ley, but  it  gained  access  to  the  region  east  of  Lake  Baikal  and 
the  trade  route  to  Beijing.  Peace  with  China  consolidated  the 
initial  breakthrough  to  the  Pacific  that  had  been  made  in  the 
middle  of  the  century. 

Muscovy's  southwestern  expansion,  particularly  its  incorpo- 
ration of  eastern  Ukraine,  had  unintended  consequences. 
Most  Ukrainians  were  Orthodox,  but  their  close  contact  with 
the  Roman  Catholic  Polish  Counter-Reformation  also  brought 
them  Western  intellectual  currents.  Through  Kiev,  Muscovy 
gained  links  to  Polish  and  Central  European  influences  and  to 
the  wider  Orthodox  world.  Although  the  Ukrainian  link  stimu- 
lated creativity  in  many  areas,  it  also  undermined  traditional 
Russian  religious  practices  and  culture.  The  Russian  Orthodox 
Church  discovered  that  its  isolation  from  Constantinople  had 
caused  variations  to  creep  into  its  liturgical  books  and  prac- 
tices. The  Russian  Orthodox  patriarch,  Nikon,  was  determined 
to  bring  the  Russian  texts  back  into  conformity  with  the  Greek 
originals.  But  Nikon  encountered  fierce  opposition  among  the 
many  Russians  who  viewed  the  corrections  as  improper  foreign 
intrusions,  or  perhaps  the  work  of  the  devil.  When  the  Ortho- 
dox Church  forced  Nikon's  reforms,  a  schism  resulted  in  1667. 
Those  who  did  not  accept  the  reforms  came  to  be  called  the 
Old  Believers  (starovery);  they  were  officially  pronounced  here- 


19 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

tics  and  were  persecuted  by  the  church  and  the  state.  The  chief 
opposition  figure,  the  archpriest  Awakum,  was  burned  at  the 
stake.  The  split  subsequently  became  permanent,  and  many 
merchants  and  peasants  joined  the  Old  Believers. 

The  tsar's  court  also  felt  the  impact  of  Ukraine  and  the  West. 
Kiev  was  a  major  transmitter  of  new  ideas  and  insight  through 
the  famed  scholarly  academy  that  Metropolitan  Mogila 
(Mohyla)  founded  there  in  1631.  Among  the  results  of  this 
infusion  of  ideas  into  Muscovy  were  baroque  architecture,  liter- 
ature, and  icon  painting.  Other  more  direct  channels  to  the 
West  opened  as  international  trade  increased  and  more  for- 
eigners came  to  Muscovy.  The  tsar's  court  was  interested  in  the 
West's  more  advanced  technology,  particularly  when  military 
applications  were  involved.  By  the  end  of  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury, Ukrainian,  Polish,  and  West  European  penetration  had 
undermined  the  Muscovite  cultural  synthesis — at  least  among 
the  elite — and  had  prepared  the  way  for  an  even  more  radical 
transformation. 

Early  Imperial  Russia 

In  the  eighteenth  century,  Muscovy  was  transformed  from  a 
static,  somewhat  isolated,  traditional  state  into  the  more 
dynamic,  partially  Westernized,  and  secularized  Russian 
Empire.  This  transformation  was  in  no  small  measure  a  result 
of  the  vision,  energy,  and  determination  of  Peter  the  Great. 
Historians  disagree  about  the  extent  to  which  Peter  himself 
transformed  Russia,  but  they  generally  concur  that  he  laid  the 
foundations  for  empire  building  over  the  next  two  centuries. 
The  era  that  Peter  initiated  signaled  the  advent  of  Russia  as  a 
major  European  power.  But,  although  the  Russian  Empire 
would  play  a  leading  political  role  in  the  next  century,  its  reten- 
tion of  serfdom  precluded  economic  progress  of  any  signifi- 
cant degree.  As  West  European  economic  growth  accelerated 
during  the  Industrial  Revolution,  which  had  begun  in  the  sec- 
ond half  of  the  eighteenth  century,  Russia  began  to  lag  ever  far- 
ther behind,  creating  new  problems  for  the  empire  as  a  great 
power. 

Peter  the  Great  and  the  Russian  Empire 

As  a  child  of  the  second  marriage  of  Tsar  Aleksey,  Peter  at 
first  was  relegated  to  the  background  of  Russian  politics  as  vari- 
ous court  factions  struggled  to  control  the  throne.  Aleksey  was 


20 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

succeeded  by  his  son  from  his  first  marriage,  Fedor  III,  a  sickly 
boy  who  died  in  1682.  Peter  then  was  made  co-tsar  with  his  half 
brother,  Ivan  V,  but  Peter's  half  sister,  Sofia,  held  the  real 
power.  She  ruled  as  regent  while  the  young  Peter  was  allowed 
to  play  war  games  with  his  friends  and  to  roam  in  Moscow's  for- 
eign quarters.  These  early  experiences  instilled  in  him  an  abid- 
ing interest  in  Western  military  practice  and  technology, 
particularly  in  military  engineering,  artillery,  navigation,  and 
shipbuilding.  In  1689,  using  troops  that  he  had  drilled  during 
childhood  games,  Peter  foiled  a  plot  to  have  Sofia  crowned. 
When  Ivan  V  died  in  1696,  Peter  became  the  sole  tsar  of  Mus- 
covy. 

War  dominated  much  of  Peter's  reign.  At  first  Peter 
attempted  to  secure  the  principality's  southern  borders  against 
the  Tatars  and  the  Ottoman  Turks.  His  campaign  against  a  fort 
on  the  Sea  of  Azov  failed  initially,  but  after  he  created  Russia's 
first  navy,  Peter  was  able  to  take  the  port  of  Azov  in  1696.  To 
continue  the  war  with  the  Ottoman  Empire,  Peter  traveled  to 
Europe  to  seek  allies.  The  first  tsar  to  make  such  a  trip,  Peter 
visited  Brandenburg,  Holland,  England,  and  the  Holy  Roman 
Empire  during  his  so-called  Grand  Embassy.  Peter  learned  a 
great  deal  and  enlisted  into  his  service  hundreds  of  West  Euro- 
pean technical  specialists.  The  embassy  was  cut  short  by  the 
attempt  to  place  Sofia  on  the  throne  instead  of  Peter,  a  revolt 
that  was  crushed  by  Peter's  followers.  As  a  result,  Peter  had 
hundreds  of  the  participants  tortured  and  killed,  and  he  pub- 
licly displayed  their  bodies  as  a  warning  to  others. 

Peter  was  unsuccessful  in  forging  a  European  coalition 
against  the  Ottoman  Empire,  but  during  his  travels  he  found 
interest  in  waging  war  against  Sweden,  then  an  important 
power  in  northern  Europe.  Seeing  an  opportunity  to  break 
through  to  the  Baltic  Sea,  Peter  made  peace  with  the  Ottoman 
Empire  in  1700  and  then  attacked  the  Swedes  at  their  port  of 
Narva  on  the  Gulf  of  Finland.  However,  Sweden's  young  king, 
Charles  XII,  proved  his  military  acumen  by  crushing  Peter's 
army.  Fortunately  for  Peter,  Charles  did  not  follow  up  his  vic- 
tory with  a  counteroffensive,  becoming  embroiled  instead  in  a 
series  of  wars  over  the  Polish  throne.  This  respite  allowed  Peter 
to  build  a  new,  Western-style  army.  When  the  armies  of  the  two 
leaders  met  again  at  the  town  of  Poltava  in  1709,  Peter  defeated 
Charles.  Charles  escaped  to  Ottoman  territory,  and  Russia  sub- 
sequently became  engaged  in  another  war  with  the  Ottoman 
Empire.  Russia  agreed  to  return  the  port  of  Azov  to  the  Otto- 


21

mans  in  1711.  The  Great  Northern  War,  which  in  essence  was 
settled  at  Poltava,  continued  until  1721,  when  Sweden  agreed 
to  the  Treaty  of  Nystad.  The  treaty  allowed  Muscovy  to  retain 
the  Baltic  territories  that  it  had  conquered:  Livonia,  Estonia, 
and  Ingria.  Through  his  victories,  Peter  acquired  a  direct  link 
with  Western  Europe.  In  celebration,  Peter  assumed  the  title  of 
emperor  as  well  as  tsar,  and  Muscovy  officially  became  the  Rus- 
sian Empire  in  1721. 

Peter  achieved  Muscovy's  expansion  into  Europe  and  its 
transformation  into  the  Russian  Empire  through  several  major 
initiatives.  He  established  Russia's  naval  forces,  reorganized  the 
army  according  to  European  models,  streamlined  the  govern- 
ment, and  mobilized  Russia's  financial  and  human  resources. 
Under  Peter,  the  army  drafted  soldiers  for  lifetime  terms  from 
the  taxpaying  population,  and  it  drew  officers  from  the  nobility 
and  required  them  to  give  lifelong  service  in  either  the  military 
or  civilian  administration.  In  1722  Peter  introduced  the  Table 
of  Ranks,  which  determined  a  person's  position  and  status 
according  to  service  to  the  tsar  rather  than  to  birth  or  seniority. 
Even  commoners  who  achieved  a  certain  level  on  the  table 
were  ennobled  automatically. 

Peter's  reorganization  of  the  government  structure  was  no 
less  thorough.  He  replaced  the  prikazy  with  colleges  or  boards 
and  created  a  senate  to  coordinate  government  policy.  Peter's 
reform  of  local  government  was  less  successful,  but  his  changes 
enabled  local  governments  to  collect  taxes  and  maintain  order. 
As  part  of  the  government  reform,  the  Orthodox  Church  was 
partially  incorporated  into  the  country's  administrative  struc- 
ture. Peter  abolished  the  patriarchate  and  replaced  it  with  a 
collective  body,  the  Holy  Synod,  led  by  a  lay  government  offi- 
cial. 

Peter  tripled  the  revenues  of  the  state  treasury  through  a 
variety  of  taxes.  He  levied  a  capitation,  or  poll  tax,  on  all  males 
except  clergy  and  nobles  and  imposed  a  myriad  of  indirect 
taxes  on  alcohol,  salt,  and  even  beards.  To  provide  uniforms 
and  weapons  for  the  military,  Peter  developed  metallurgical 
and  textile  industries  using  serf  labor. 

Peter  wanted  to  equip  Russia  with  modern  technology,  insti- 
tutions, and  ideas.  He  required  Western-style  education  for  all 
male  nobles,  introduced  so-called  cipher  schools  to  teach  the 
alphabet  and  basic  arithmetic,  established  a  printing  house, 
and  funded  the  Academy  of  Sciences  (see  Glossary),  which  was 
established  just  before  his  death  in  1725  and  became  one  of 


22 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 


Russia's  most  important  cultural  institutions.  He  demanded 
that  aristocrats  acquire  the  dress,  tastes,  and  social  customs  of 
the  West.  The  result  was  a  deepening  of  the  cultural  rift 
between  the  nobility  and  the  mass  of  Russian  people.  The  best 
illustration  of  Peter's  drive  for  Westernization,  his  break  with 
traditions,  and  his  coercive  methods  was  his  construction  in 
1703  of  a  new,  architecturally  Western  capital,  St.  Petersburg, 
situated  on  land  newly  conquered  from  Sweden  on  the  Gulf  of 
Finland.  Although  St.  Petersburg  faced  westward,  its  Western- 
ization was  by  coercion,  and  it  could  not  arouse  the  individual- 
istic spirit  that  was  an  important  element  in  the  Western  ways 
Peter  so  admired. 

Peter's  reign  raised  questions  about  Russia's  backwardness, 
its  relationship  to  the  West,  the  appropriateness  of  reform  from 
above,  and  other  fundamental  problems  that  have  confronted 
many  of  Russia's  subsequent  rulers.  In  the  nineteenth  century, 
Russians  debated  whether  Peter  was  correct  in  pointing  Russia 
toward  the  West  or  whether  his  reforms  had  been  a  violation  of 
Russia's  natural  traditions. 

The  Era  of  Palace  Revolutions 

Peter  changed  the  rules  of  succession  to  the  throne  after  he 
killed  his  own  son,  Aleksey,  who  had  opposed  his  father's 
reforms  and  served  as  a  rallying  figure  for  antireform  groups.  A 
new  law  provided  that  the  tsar  would  choose  his  own  successor, 
but  Peter  failed  to  do  so  before  his  death  in  1725.  In  the 
decades  that  followed,  the  absence  of  clear  rules  of  succession 
left  the  monarchy  open  to  intrigues,  plots,  coups,  and  counter- 
coups.  Henceforth,  the  crucial  factor  for  obtaining  the  throne 
was  the  support  of  the  elite  palace  guard  in  St.  Petersburg. 

After  Peter's  death,  his  wife,  Catherine  I,  seized  the  throne. 
But  when  she  died  in  1727,  Peter's  grandson,  Peter  II,  was 
crowned  tsar.  In  1730  Peter  II  succumbed  to  smallpox,  and 
Anna,  a  daughter  of  Ivan  V,  who  had  been  co-ruler  with  Peter, 
ascended  the  throne.  The  clique  of  nobles  that  put  Anna  on 
the  throne  attempted  to  impose  various  conditions  on  her.  In 
her  struggle  against  those  restrictions,  Anna  had  the  support  of 
other  nobles  who  feared  oligarchic  rule  more  than  autocracy. 
Thus  the  principle  of  autocracy  continued  to  receive  strong 
support  despite  chaotic  struggles  for  the  throne. 

Anna  died  in  1740,  and  her  infant  grandnephew  was  pro- 
claimed tsar  as  Ivan  VI.  After  a  series  of  coups,  however,  he  was 
replaced  by  Peter  the  Great's  daughter  Elizabeth  (r.  1741-62). 


23 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

During  Elizabeth's  reign,  which  was  much  more  effective  than 
those  of  her  immediate  predecessors,  a  Westernized  Russian 
culture  began  to  emerge.  Among  notable  cultural  events  were 
the  founding  of  Moscow  University  (1755)  and  the  Academy  of 
Fine  Arts  (1757)  and  the  emergence  of  Russia's  first  eminent 
scientist  and  scholar,  Mikhail  Lomonosov. 

During  the  rule  of  Peter's  successors,  Russia  took  a  more 
active  role  in  European  statecraft.  From  1726  to  1761,  Russia 
was  allied  with  Austria  against  the  Ottoman  Empire,  which 
France  usually  supported.  In  the  War  of  Polish  Succession 
(1733-35),  Russia  and  Austria  blocked  the  French  candidate  to 
the  Polish  throne.  In  a  costly  war  with  the  Ottoman  Empire 
(1734-39),  Russia  reacquired  the  port  of  Azov  Russia's  greatest 
reach  into  Europe  was  during  the  Seven  Years'  War  (1756-63), 
which  was  fought  on  three  continents  between  Britain  and 
France  with  numerous  allies  on  both  sides.  In  that  war,  Russia 
continued  its  alliance  with  Austria,  but  Austria  shifted  to  an  alli- 
ance with  France  against  Prussia.  In  1760  Russian  forces  were  at 
the  gates  of  Berlin.  Fortunately  for  Prussia,  Elizabeth  died  in 
1762,  and  her  successor,  Peter  III,  allied  Russia  with  Prussia 
because  of  his  devotion  to  the  Prussian  emperor,  Frederick  the 
Great. 

Peter  III  had  a  short  and  unpopular  reign.  Although  he  was 
a  grandson  of  Peter  the  Great,  his  father  was  the  duke  of  Hol- 
stein,  so  Peter  III  was  raised  in  a  German  Lutheran  environ- 
ment. Russians  therefore  considered  him  a  foreigner.  Making 
no  secret  of  his  contempt  for  all  things  Russian,  Peter  created 
deep  resentment  by  forcing  Prussian  military  drills  on  the  Rus- 
sian military,  attacking  the  Orthodox  Church,  and  depriving 
Russia  of  a  military  victory  by  establishing  his  sudden  alliance 
with  Prussia.  Making  use  of  the  discontent  and  fearing  for  her 
own  position,  Peter  Ill's  wife,  Catherine,  deposed  her  husband 
in  a  coup,  and  her  lover,  Aleksey  Orlov,  subsequently  murdered 
him.  Thus,  in  June  1762  a  German  princess  who  had  no  legiti- 
mate claim  to  the  Russian  throne  became  Catherine  II, 
empress  of  Russia. 

Imperial  Expansion  and  Maturation:  Catherine  II 

Catherine  IPs  reign  was  notable  for  imperial  expansion, 
which  brought  the  empire  huge  new  territories  in  the  south 
and  west,  and  for  internal  consolidation.  Following  a  war  that 
broke  out  with  the  Ottoman  Empire  in  1768,  the  parties  agreed 
to  the  Treaty  of  Kuchuk-Kainarji  in  1774.  By  that  treaty,  Russia 


24 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

acquired  an  outlet  to  the  Black  Sea,  and  the  Crimean  Tatars 
were  made  independent  of  the  Ottomans.  In  1783  Catherine 
annexed  Crimea,  helping  to  spark  the  next  war  with  the  Otto- 
man Empire,  which  began  in  1787.  By  the  Treaty  of  Jassy  in 
1792,  Russia  expanded  southward  to  the  Dnestr  River.  The 
terms  of  the  treaty  fell  far  short  of  the  goals  of  Catherine's 
reputed  "Greek  project" — the  expulsion  of  the  Ottomans  from 
Europe  and  the  renewal  of  a  Byzantine  Empire  under  Russian 
control.  The  Ottoman  Empire  no  longer  was  a  serious  threat  to 
Russia,  however,  and  was  forced  to  tolerate  an  increasing  Rus- 
sian influence  over  the  Balkans. 

Russia's  westward  expansion  under  Catherine  was  the  result 
of  the  partitioning  of  Poland.  As  Poland  became  increasingly 
weak  in  the  eighteenth  century,  each  of  its  neighbors — Russia, 
Prussia,  and  Austria — tried  to  place  its  own  candidate  on  the 
Polish  throne.  In  1772  the  three  agreed  on  an  initial  partition 
of  Polish  territory,  by  which  Russia  received  parts  of  Belorussia 
and  Livonia.  After  the  partition,  Poland  initiated  an  extensive 
reform  program,  which  included  a  democratic  constitution 
that  alarmed  reactionary  factions  in  Poland  and  in  Russia. 
Using  the  danger  of  radicalism  as  an  excuse,  the  same  three 
powers  abrogated  the  constitution  and  in  1793  again  stripped 
Poland  of  territory.  This  time  Russia  obtained  most  of  Belorus- 
sia and  Ukraine  west  of  the  Dnepr  River.  The  1793  partition  led 
to  an  anti-Russian  and  anti-Prussian  uprising  in  Poland,  which 
ended  with  the  third  partition  in  1795.  The  result  was  that 
Poland  was  wiped  off  the  map. 

Although  the  partitioning  of  Poland  greatly  added  to  Rus- 
sia's territory  and  prestige,  it  also  created  new  difficulties.  Hav- 
ing lost  Poland  as  a  buffer,  Russia  now  had  to  share  borders 
with  both  Prussia  and  Austria.  In  addition,  the  empire  became 
more  ethnically  heterogeneous  as  it  absorbed  large  numbers  of 
Poles,  Ukrainians,  Belorussians,  and  Jews.  The  fate  of  the 
Ukrainians  and  Belorussians,  who  were  primarily  serfs, 
changed  little  at  first  under  Russian  rule.  Roman  Catholic 
Poles  resented  their  loss  of  independence,  however,  and 
proved  to  be  difficult  to  integrate.  Russia  had  barred  Jews  from 
the  empire  in  1742  and  viewed  them  as  an  alien  population.  A 
decree  of  January  3,  1792,  formally  initiated  the  Pale  of  Settle- 
ment, which  permitted  Jews  to  live  only  in  the  western  part  of 
the  empire,  thereby  setting  the  stage  for  anti-Jewish  discrimina- 
tion in  later  periods  (see  Other  Religions,  ch.  4).  At  the  same 
time,  Russia  abolished  the  autonomy  of  Ukraine  east  of  the 


25 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Dnepr,  the  Baltic  republics,  and  various  Cossack  areas.  With 
her  emphasis  on  a  uniformly  administered  empire,  Catherine 
presaged  the  policy  of  Russification  that  later  tsars  and  their 
successors  would  practice. 

Historians  have  debated  Catherine's  sincerity  as  an  enlight- 
ened monarch,  but  few  have  doubted  that  she  believed  in  gov- 
ernment activism  aimed  at  developing  the  empire's  resources 
and  making  its  administration  more  effective.  Initially,  Cathe- 
rine attempted  to  rationalize  government  procedures  through 
law.  In  1767  she  created  the  Legislative  Commission,  drawn 
from  nobles,  townsmen,  and  others,  to  codify  Russia's  laws. 
Although  the  commission  did  not  formulate  a  new  law  code, 
Catherine's  Instruction  to  the  Commission  introduced  some 
Russians  to  Western  political  and  legal  thinking. 

During  the  1768-74  war  with  the  Ottoman  Empire,  Russia 
experienced  a  major  social  upheaval,  the  Pugachev  Uprising. 
In  1773  a  Don  Cossack,  Emel'yan  Pugachev,  announced  that  he 
was  Peter  III.  Other  Cossacks,  various  Turkic  tribes  that  felt  the 
impingement  of  the  Russian  centralizing  state,  and  industrial 
workers  in  the  Ural  Mountains,  as  well  as  peasants  hoping  to 
escape  serfdom,  all  joined  in  the  rebellion.  Russia's  preoccupa- 
tion with  the  war  enabled  Pugachev  to  take  control  of  a  part  of 
the  Volga  area,  but  the  regular  army  crushed  the  rebellion  in 
1774. 

The  Pugachev  Uprising  bolstered  Catherine's  determination 
to  reorganize  Russia's  provincial  administration.  In  1775  she 
divided  Russia  into  provinces  and  districts  according  to  popula- 
tion statistics.  She  then  gave  each  province  an  expanded 
administrative,  police,  and  judicial  apparatus.  Nobles  no 
longer  were  required  to  serve  the  central  government,  as  they 
had  since  Peter  the  Great's  time,  and  many  of  them  received 
significant  roles  in  administering  provincial  governments. 

Catherine  also  attempted  to  organize  society  into  well- 
defined  social  groups,  or  estates.  In  1785  she  issued  charters  to 
nobles  and  townsmen.  The  Charter  to  the  Nobility  confirmed 
the  liberation  of  the  nobles  from  compulsory  service  and  gave 
them  rights  that  not  even  the  autocracy  could  infringe  upon. 
The  Charter  to  the  Towns  proved  to  be  complicated  and  ulti- 
mately less  successful  than  the  one  issued  to  the  nobles.  Failure 
to  issue  a  similar  charter  to  state  peasants,  or  to  ameliorate  the 
conditions  of  serfdom,  made  Catherine's  social  reforms  incom- 
plete. 


26 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 


The  intellectual  westernization  of  the  elite  continued  during 
Catherine's  reign.  An  increase  in  the  number  of  books  and 
periodicals  also  brought  forth  intellectual  debates  and  social 
criticism  (see  Literature  and  the  Arts,  ch.  4).  In  1790  Aleksandr 
Radishchev  published  his  Journey  from  St.  Petersburg  to  Moscow,  a 
fierce  attack  on  serfdom  and  the  autocracy.  Catherine,  already 
frightened  by  the  French  Revolution,  had  Radishchev  arrested 
and  banished  to  Siberia.  Radishchev  was  later  recognized  as  the 
father  of  Russian  radicalism. 

Catherine  brought  many  of  the  policies  of  Peter  the  Great  to 
fruition  and  set  the  foundation  for  the  nineteenth-century 
empire.  Russia  became  a  power  capable  of  competing  with  its 
European  neighbors  on  military,  political,  and  diplomatic 
grounds.  Russia's  elite  became  culturally  more  like  the  elites  of 
Central  and  West  European  countries.  The  organization  of 
society  and  the  government  system,  from  Peter  the  Great's  cen- 
tral institutions  to  Catherine's  provincial  administration, 
remained  basically  unchanged  until  the  emancipation  of  the 
serfs  in  1861  and,  in  some  respects,  until  the  fall  of  the  monar- 
chy in  1917.  Catherine's  push  to  the  south,  including  the  estab- 
lishment of  Odessa  as  a  Russian  port  on  the  Black  Sea, 
provided  the  basis  for  Russia's  nineteenth-century  grain  trade. 

Despite  such  accomplishments,  the  empire  that  Peter  I  and 
Catherine  II  had  built  was  beset  with  fundamental  problems.  A 
small  Europeanized  elite,  alienated  from  the  mass  of  ordinary 
Russians,  raised  questions  about  the  very  essence  of  Russia's 
history,  culture,  and  identity.  Russia  achieved  its  military  pre- 
eminence by  reliance  on  coercion  and  a  primitive  command 
economy  based  on  serfdom.  Although  Russia's  economic  devel- 
opment was  almost  sufficient  for  its  eighteenth-century  needs, 
it  was  no  match  for  the  transformation  the  Industrial  Revolu- 
tion was  causing  in  Western  countries.  Catherine's  attempt  at 
organizing  society  into  corporate  estates  was  already  being 
challenged  by  the  French  Revolution,  which  emphasized  indi- 
vidual citizenship.  Russia's  territorial  expansion  and  the  incor- 
poration of  an  increasing  number  of  non-Russians  into  the 
empire  set  the  stage  for  the  future  nationalities  problem. 
Finally,  the  first  questioning  of  serfdom  and  autocracy  on 
moral  grounds  foreshadowed  the  conflict  between  the  state 
and  the  intelligentsia  that  was  to  become  dominant  in  the  nine- 
teenth century.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 


Ruling  the  Empire 

During  the  early  nineteenth  century,  Russia's  population, 
resources,  international  diplomacy,  and  military  forces  made  it 
one  of  the  most  powerful  states  in  the  world.  Its  power  enabled 
it  to  play  an  increasingly  assertive  role  in  Europe's  affairs.  This 
role  drew  the  empire  into  a  series  of  wars  against  Napoleon, 
which  had  far-reaching  consequences  for  Russia  and  the  rest  of 
Europe.  After  a  period  of  enlightenment,  Russia  became  an 
active  opponent  of  liberalizing  trends  in  Central  and  Western 
Europe.  Internally,  Russia's  population  had  grown  more 
diverse  with  each  territorial  acquisition.  The  population 
included  Lutheran  Finns,  Baltic  Germans,  Estonians,  and  some 
Latvians;  Roman  Catholic  Lithuanians,  Poles,  and  some  Latvi- 
ans; Orthodox  and  Uniate  (see  Glossary)  Belorussians  and 
Ukrainians;  Muslim  peoples  along  the  empire's  southern  bor- 
der; Orthodox  Greeks  and  Georgians;  and  members  of  the 
Armenian  Apostolic  Church.  As  Western  influence  and  opposi- 
tion to  Russian  autocracy  mounted,  the  regime  reacted  by  cre- 
ating a  secret  police  and  increasing  censorship  in  order  to 
curtail  the  activities  of  persons  advocating  change.  The  regime 
remained  committed  to  its  serf-based  economy  as  the  means  of 
supporting  the  upper  classes,  the  government,  and  the  military 
forces.  But  Russia's  backwardness  and  inherent  weakness  were 
revealed  in  the  middle  of  the  century,  when  several  powers 
forced  the  surrender  of  a  Russian  fortress  in  Crimea. 

War  and  Peace,  1796-1825 

Catherine  II  died  in  1796,  and  her  son  Paul  (r.  1796-1801) 
succeeded  her.  Painfully  aware  that  Catherine  had  planned  to 
bypass  him  and  name  his  son,  Alexander,  as  tsar,  Paul  instituted 
primogeniture  in  the  male  line  as  the  basis  for  succession.  It 
was  one  of  the  few  lasting  reforms  of  Paul's  brief  reign.  He  also 
chartered  a  Russian-American  company,  which  eventually  led 
to  Russia's  acquisition  of  Alaska.  Paul  was  haughty  and  unsta- 
ble, and  he  frequently  reversed  his  previous  decisions,  creating 
administrative  chaos  and  accumulating  enemies. 

As  a  major  European  power,  Russia  could  not  escape  the 
wars  involving  revolutionary  and  Napoleonic  France.  Paul 
became  an  adamant  opponent  of  France,  and  Russia  joined 
Britain  and  Austria  in  a  war  against  France.  In  1798-99  Russian 
troops  under  one  of  the  country's  most  famous  generals,  Alek- 
sandr  Suvorov,  performed  brilliantly  in  Italy  and  Switzerland.

Paul  reversed  himself,  however,  and  abandoned  his  allies.  This 
reversal,  coupled  with  increasingly  arbitrary  domestic  policies, 
sparked  a  coup,  and  in  March  1801  Paul  was  assassinated. 

The  new  tsar,  Alexander  I  (r.  1801-25),  came  to  the  throne 
as  the  result  of  his  father's  murder,  in  which  he  was  implicated. 
Groomed  for  the  throne  by  Catherine  II  and  raised  in  the  spirit 
of  enlightenment,  Alexander  also  had  an  inclination  toward 
romanticism  and  religious  mysticism,  particularly  in  the  latter 
period  of  his  reign.  Alexander  tinkered  with  changes  in  the 
central  government,  and  he  replaced  the  colleges  that  Peter 
the  Great  had  set  up  with  ministries,  but  without  a  coordinat- 
ing prime  minister.  The  brilliant  statesman  Mikhail  Speranskiy, 
who  was  the  tsar's  chief  adviser  early  in  his  reign,  proposed  an 
extensive  constitutional  reform  of  the  government,  but  Alex- 
ander dismissed  him  in  1812  and  lost  interest  in  reform. 

Alexander's  primary  focus  was  not  on  domestic  policy  but  on 
foreign  affairs,  and  particularly  on  Napoleon.  Fearing  Napo- 
leon's expansionist  ambitions  and  the  growth  of  French  power, 
Alexander  joined  Britain  and  Austria  against  Napoleon.  Napo- 
leon defeated  the  Russians  and  Austrians  at  Austerlitz  in  1805 
and  trounced  the  Russians  at  Friedland  in  1807.  Alexander  was 
forced  to  sue  for  peace,  and  by  the  Treaty  of  Tilsit,  signed  in 
1807,  he  became  Napoleon's  ally.  Russia  lost  little  territory 
under  the  treaty,  and  Alexander  made  use  of  his  alliance  with 
Napoleon  for  further  expansion.  He  wrested  the  Grand  Duchy 
of  Finland  from  Sweden  in  1809  and  acquired  Bessarabia  from 
Turkey  in  1812. 

The  Russo-French  alliance  gradually  became  strained.  Napo- 
leon was  concerned  about  Russia's  intentions  in  the  strategi- 
cally vital  Bosporus  and  Dardenelles  straits.  At  the  same  time, 
Alexander  viewed  the  Grand  Duchy  of  Warsaw,  the  French-con- 
trolled reconstituted  Polish  state,  with  suspicion.  The  require- 
ment of  joining  France's  Continental  Blockade  against  Britain 
was  a  serious  disruption  of  Russian  commerce,  and  in  1810 
Alexander  repudiated  the  obligation.  In  June  1812,  Napoleon 
invaded  Russia  with  600,000  troops — a  force  twice  as  large  as 
the  Russian  regular  army.  Napoleon  hoped  to  inflict  a  major 
defeat  on  the  Russians  and  force  Alexander  to  sue  for  peace.  As 
Napoleon  pushed  the  Russian  forces  back,  however,  he  became 
seriously  overextended.  Obstinate  Russian  resistance  combined 
with  the  Russian  winter  to  deal  Napoleon  a  disastrous  defeat, 
from  which  fewer  than  30,000  of  his  troops  returned  to  their 
homeland.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

As  the  French  retreated,  the  Russians  pursued  them  into 
Central  and  Western  Europe  and  to  the  gates  of  Paris.  After  the 
allies  defeated  Napoleon,  Alexander  became  known  as  the  sav- 
ior of  Europe,  and  he  played  a  prominent  role  in  the  redraw- 
ing of  the  map  of  Europe  at  the  Congress  of  Vienna  in  1815.  In 
the  same  year,  under  the  influence  of  religious  mysticism,  Alex- 
ander initiated  the  creation  of  the  Holy  Alliance,  a  loose  agree- 
ment pledging  the  rulers  of  the  nations  involved — including 
most  of  Europe — to  act  according  to  Christian  principles.  More 
pragmatically,  in  1814  Russia,  Britain,  Austria,  and  Prussia  had 
formed  the  Quadruple  Alliance.  The  allies  created  an  interna- 
tional system  to  maintain  the  territorial  status  quo  and  prevent 
the  resurgence  of  an  expansionist  France.  The  Quadruple  Alli- 
ance, confirmed  by  a  number  of  international  conferences, 
ensured  Russia's  influence  in  Europe. 

At  the  same  time,  Russia  continued  its  expansion.  The  Con- 
gress of  Vienna  created  the  Kingdom  of  Poland  (Russian 
Poland),  to  which  Alexander  granted  a  constitution.  Thus, 
Alexander  I  became  the  constitutional  monarch  of  Poland 
while  remaining  the  autocratic  tsar  of  Russia.  He  was  also  the 
limited  monarch  of  Finland,  which  had  been  annexed  in  1809 
and  awarded  autonomous  status.  In  1813  Russia  gained  terri- 
tory in  the  Baku  area  of  the  Caucasus  at  the  expense  of  Persia. 
By  the  early  nineteenth  century,  the  empire  also  was  firmly 
ensconced  in  Alaska. 

Historians  have  generally  agreed  that  a  revolutionary  move- 
ment was  born  during  the  reign  of  Alexander  I.  Young  officers 
who  had  pursued  Napoleon  into  Western  Europe  came  back  to 
Russia  with  revolutionary  ideas,  including  human  rights,  repre- 
sentative government,  and  mass  democracy.  The  intellectual 
Westernization  that  had  been  fostered  in  the  eighteenth  cen- 
tury by  a  paternalistic,  autocratic  Russian  state  now  included 
opposition  to  autocracy,  demands  for  representative  govern- 
ment, calls  for  the  abolition  of  serfdom,  and,  in  some 
instances,  advocacy  of  a  revolutionary  overthrow  of  the  govern- 
ment. Officers  were  particularly  incensed  that  Alexander  had 
granted  Poland  a  constitution  while  Russia  remained  without 
one.  Several  clandestine  organizations  were  preparing  for  an 
uprising  when  Alexander  died  unexpectedly  in  1825.  Following 
his  death,  there  was  confusion  about  who  would  succeed  him 
because  the  next  in  line,  his  brother  Constantine,  had  relin- 
quished his  right  to  the  throne.  A  group  of  officers  command- 
ing about  3,000  men  refused  to  swear  allegiance  to  the  new 


30 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

tsar,  Alexander's  brother  Nicholas,  proclaiming  instead  their 
loyalty  to  the  idea  of  a  Russian  constitution.  Because  these 
events  occurred  in  December  1825,  the  rebels  were  called 
Decembrists.  Nicholas  easily  overcame  the  revolt,  and  the 
Decembrists  who  remained  alive  were  arrested.  Many  were 
exiled  to  Siberia. 

To  some  extent,  the  Decembrists  were  in  the  tradition  of  a 
long  line  of  palace  revolutionaries  who  wanted  to  place  their 
candidate  on  the  throne.  But  because  the  Decembrists  also 
wanted  to  implement  a  liberal  political  program,  their  revolt 
has  been  considered  the  beginning  of  a  revolutionary  move- 
ment. The  Decembrist  Revolt  was  the  first  open  breach 
between  the  government  and  liberal  elements,  and  it  would 
subsequently  widen. 

Reaction  under  Nicholas  I 

Nicholas  completely  lacked  his  brother's  spiritual  and  intel- 
lectual breadth;  he  saw  his  role  simply  as  one  paternal  autocrat 
ruling  his  people  by  whatever  means  were  necessary.  Having 
experienced  the  trauma  of  the  Decembrist  Revolt,  Nicholas  I 
was  determined  to  restrain  Russian  society.  A  secret  police,  the 
so-called  Third  Section,  ran  a  huge  network  of  spies  and 
informers.  The  government  exercised  censorship  and  other 
controls  over  education,  publishing,  and  all  manifestations  of 
public  life.  In  1833  the  minister  of  education,  Sergey  Uvarov, 
devised  a  program  of  "autocracy,  Orthodoxy,  and  nationality" 
as  the  guiding  principle  of  the  regime.  The  people  were  to 
show  loyalty  to  the  unlimited  authority  of  the  tsar,  to  the  tradi- 
tions of  the  Orthodox  Church,  and,  in  a  vague  way,  to  the  Rus- 
sian nation.  These  principles  did  not  gain  the  support  of  the 
population  but  instead  led  to  repression  in  general  and  to  sup- 
pression of  non-Russian  nationalities  and  religions  in  particu- 
lar. For  example,  the  government  suppressed  the  Uniate 
Church  in  Ukraine  and  Belorussia  in  1839. 

The  official  emphasis  on  Russian  nationalism  contributed  to 
a  debate  on  Russia's  place  in  the  world,  the  meaning  of  Russian 
history,  and  the  future  of  Russia.  One  group,  the  Westernizers, 
believed  that  Russia  remained  backward  and  primitive  and 
could  progress  only  through  more  thorough  Europeanization. 
Another  group,  the  Slavophiles,  idealized  the  Russia  that  had 
existed  before  Peter  the  Great.  The  Slavophiles  viewed  old  Rus- 
sia as  a  source  of  wholeness  and  looked  askance  at  Western 
rationalism  and  materialism.  Some  of  them  believed  that  the 


31 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russian  peasant  commune,  or  mir,  offered  an  attractive  alterna- 
tive to  Western  capitalism  and  could  make  Russia  a  potential 
social  and  moral  savior.  The  Slavophiles,  therefore,  repre- 
sented a  form  of  Russian  messianism. 

Despite  the  repressions  of  this  period,  Russia  experienced  a 
flowering  of  literature  and  the  arts.  Through  the  works  of  Alek- 
sandr  Pushkin,  Nikolay  Gogol',  Ivan  Turgenev,  and  numerous 
others,  Russian  literature  gained  international  stature  and  rec- 
ognition. Ballet  took  root  in  Russia  after  its  importation  from 
France,  and  classical  music  became  firmly  established  with  the 
compositions  of  Mikhail  Glinka  (1804-57)  (see  Literature  and 
the  Arts,  ch.  4). 

In  foreign  policy,  Nicholas  I  acted  as  the  protector  of  ruling 
legitimism  and  guardian  against  revolution.  His  offers  to  sup- 
press revolution  on  the  European  continent,  accepted  in  some 
instances,  earned  him  the  label  of  gendarme  of  Europe.  In 
1830,  after  a  popular  uprising  had  occurred  in  France,  the 
Poles  in  Russian  Poland  revolted.  Nicholas  crushed  the  rebel- 
lion, abrogated  the  Polish  constitution,  and  reduced  Poland  to 
the  status  of  a  Russian  province.  In  1848,  when  a  series  of  revo- 
lutions convulsed  Europe,  Nicholas  was  in  the  forefront  of 
reaction.  In  1849  he  intervened  on  behalf  of  the  Habsburgs 
and  helped  suppress  an  uprising  in  Hungary,  and  he  also 
urged  Prussia  not  to  accept  a  liberal  constitution.  Having 
helped  conservative  forces  repel  the  specter  of  revolution, 
Nicholas  I  seemed  to  dominate  Europe. 

Russian  dominance  proved  illusory,  however.  While  Nicholas 
was  attempting  to  maintain  the  status  quo  in  Europe,  he 
adopted  an  aggressive  policy  toward  the  Ottoman  Empire. 
Nicholas  I  was  following  the  traditional  Russian  policy  of  resolv- 
ing the  so-called  Eastern  Question  by  seeking  to  partition  the 
Ottoman  Empire  and  establish  a  protectorate  over  the  Ortho- 
dox population  of  the  Balkans,  still  largely  under  Ottoman 
control  in  the  1820s.  Russia  fought  a  successful  war  with  the 
Ottomans  in  1828  and  1829.  In  1833  Russia  negotiated  the 
Treaty  of  Unkiar-Skelessi  with  the  Ottoman  Empire.  The  major 
European  parties  mistakenly  believed  that  the  treaty  contained 
a  secret  clause  granting  Russia  the  right  to  send  warships 
through  the  Bosporus  and  Dardanelles  straits.  By  the  London 
Straits  Convention  of  1841,  they  affirmed  Ottoman  control 
over  the  straits  and  forbade  any  power,  including  Russia,  to 
send  warships  through  the  straits.  Based  on  his  role  in  sup- 
pressing the  revolutions  of  1848  and  his  mistaken  belief  that  he 


32 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

had  British  diplomatic  support,  Nicholas  moved  against  the 
Ottomans,  who  declared  war  on  Russia  in  1853.  Fearing  the 
results  of  an  Ottoman  defeat  by  Russia,  in  1854  Britain  and 
France  joined  what  became  known  as  the  Crimean  War  on  the 
Ottoman  side.  Austria  offered  the  Ottomans  diplomatic  sup- 
port, and  Prussia  remained  neutral,  leaving  Russia  without 
allies  on  the  continent.  The  European  allies  landed  in  Crimea 
and  laid  siege  to  the  well-fortified  Russian  base  at  Sevastopol'. 
After  a  year's  siege  the  base  fell,  exposing  Russia's  inability  to 
defend  a  major  fortification  on  its  own  soil.  Nicholas  I  died 
before  the  fall  of  Sevastopol',  but  he  already  had  recognized 
the  failure  of  his  regime.  Russia  now  faced  the  choice  of  initiat- 
ing major  reforms  or  losing  its  status  as  a  major  European 
power. 

Transformation  of  Russia  in  the  Nineteenth  Century 

The  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries  were 
times  of  crisis  for  Russia.  Not  only  did  technology  and  industry 
continue  to  develop  more  rapidly  in  the  West,  but  also  new, 
dynamic,  competitive  great  powers  appeared  on  the  world 
scene:  Otto  von  Bismarck  united  Germany  in  the  1860s,  the 
post-Civil  War  United  States  grew  in  size  and  strength,  and  a 
modernized  Japan  emerged  from  the  Meiji  Restoration  of 
1868.  Although  Russia  was  an  expanding  regional  giant  in  Cen- 
tral Asia,  bordering  the  Ottoman,  Persian,  British  Indian,  and 
Chinese  empires,  it  could  not  generate  enough  capital  to  sup- 
port rapid  industrial  development  or  to  compete  with 
advanced  countries  on  a  commercial  basis.  Russia's  fundamen- 
tal dilemma  was  that  accelerated  domestic  development  risked 
upheaval  at  home,  but  slower  progress  risked  full  economic 
dependency  on  the  faster-advancing  countries  to  the  east  and 
west.  In  fact,  political  ferment,  particularly  among  the  intelli- 
gentsia, accompanied  the  transformation  of  Russia's  economic 
and  social  structure,  but  so  did  impressive  developments  in  lit- 
erature, music,  the  fine  arts,  and  the  natural  sciences. 

Economic  Developments 

Throughout  the  last  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  Russia's 
economy  developed  more  slowly  than  did  that  of  the  major 
European  nations  to  its  west.  Russia's  population  was  substan- 
tially larger  than  those  of  the  more  developed  Western  coun- 
tries, but  the  vast  majority  of  the  people  lived  in  rural 


33 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

communities  and  engaged  in  relatively  primitive  agriculture. 
Industry,  in  general,  had  greater  state  involvement  than  in 
Western  Europe,  but  in  selected  sectors  it  was  developing  with 
private  initiative,  some  of  it  foreign.  Between  1850  and  1900, 
Russia's  population  doubled,  but  it  remained  chiefly  rural  well 
into  the  twentieth  century.  Russia's  population  growth  rate 
from  1850  to  1910  was  the  fastest  of  all  the  major  powers  except 
for  the  United  States.  Agriculture,  which  was  technologically 
underdeveloped,  remained  in  the  hands  of  former  serfs  and 
former  state  peasants,  who  together  constituted  about  four- 
fifths  of  the  rural  population.  Large  estates  of  more  than  fifty 
square  kilometers  accounted  for  about  20  percent  of  all  farm- 
land, but  few  such  estates  were  worked  in  efficient,  large-scale 
units.  Small-scale  peasant  farming  and  the  growth  of  the  rural 
population  increased  the  amount  of  land  used  for  agricultural 
development,  but  land  was  used  more  for  gardens  and  fields  of 
grain  and  less  for  grazing  meadows  than  it  had  been  in  the 
past. 

Industrial  growth  was  significant,  although  unsteady,  and  in 
absolute  terms  it  was  not  extensive.  Russia's  industrial  regions 
included  Moscow,  the  central  regions  of  European  Russia,  St. 
Petersburg,  the  Baltic  cities,  Russian  Poland,  some  areas  along 
the  lower  Don  and  Dnepr  rivers,  and  the  southern  Ural  Moun- 
tains. By  1890  Russia  had  about  32,000  kilometers  of  railroads 
and  1.4  million  factory  workers,  most  of  whom  worked  in  the 
textile  industry.  Between  1860  and  1890,  annual  coal  produc- 
tion had  grown  about  1,200  percent  to  over  6.6  million  tons, 
and  iron  and  steel  production  had  more  than  doubled  to  2  mil- 
lion tons  per  year.  The  state  budget  had  more  than  doubled, 
however,  and  debt  expenditures  had  quadrupled,  constituting 
28  percent  of  official  expenditures  in  1891.  Foreign  trade  was 
inadequate  to  meet  the  empire's  needs.  Until  the  state  intro- 
duced high  industrial  tariffs  in  the  1880s,  it  could  not  finance 
trade  with  the  West  because  its  surpluses  were  insufficient  to 
cover  the  debts. 

Reforms  and  Their  Limits,  1855-92 

Tsar  Alexander  II,  who  succeeded  Nicholas  I  in  1855,  was  a 
conservative  who  saw  no  alternative  but  to  implement  change. 
Alexander  initiated  substantial  reforms  in  education,  the  gov- 
ernment, the  judiciary,  and  the  military.  In  1861  he  proclaimed 
the  emancipation  of  about  20  million  privately  held  serfs.  Local 
commissions,  which  were  dominated  by  landlords,  effected 


34 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 


emancipation  by  giving  land  and  limited  freedom  to  the  serfs. 
The  former  serfs  usually  remained  in  the  village  commune,  but 
they  were  required  to  make  redemption  payments  to  the  gov- 
ernment over  a  period  of  almost  fifty  years.  The  government 
compensated  former  owners  of  serfs  by  issuing  them  bonds. 

The  regime  had  envisioned  that  the  50,000  landlords  who 
possessed  estates  of  more  than  110  hectares  would  thrive  with- 
out serfs  and  would  continue  to  provide  loyal  political  and 
administrative  leadership  in  the  countryside.  The  government 
also  had  expected  that  peasants  would  produce  sufficient  crops 
for  their  own  consumption  and  for  export  sales,  thereby  help- 
ing to  finance  most  of  the  government's  expenses,  imports, 
and  foreign  debt.  Neither  of  the  government's  expectations 
was  realistic,  however,  and  emancipation  left  both  former  serfs 
and  their  former  owners  dissatisfied.  The  new  peasants  soon 
fell  behind  in  their  payments  to  the  government  because  the 
land  they  had  received  was  poor  and  because  Russian  agricul- 
tural methods  were  inadequate.  The  former  owners  often  had 
to  sell  their  lands  to  remain  solvent  because  most  of  them 
could  neither  farm  nor  manage  estates  without  their  former 
serfs.  In  addition,  the  value  of  their  government  bonds  fell  as 
the  peasants  failed  to  make  their  redemption  payments. 

Reforms  of  local  government  closely  followed  emancipation. 
In  1864  most  local  government  in  the  European  part  of  Russia 
was  organized  into  provincial  and  district  zemstva  (sing.,  zem- 
stvo),  which  were  made  up  of  representatives  of  all  classes  and 
were  responsible  for  local  schools,  public  health,  roads,  pris- 
ons, food  supply,  and  other  concerns.  In  1870  elected  city 
councils,  or  dumy  (sing.,  duma),  were  formed.  Dominated  by 
property  owners  and  constrained  by  provincial  governors  and 
the  police,  the  zemstva  and  dumy  raised  taxes  and  levied  labor  to 
support  their  activities. 

In  1864  the  regime  implemented  judicial  reforms.  In  major 
towns,  it  established  Western-style  courts  with  juries.  In  general, 
the  judicial  system  functioned  effectively,  but  the  government 
lacked  the  finances  and  cultural  influence  to  extend  the  court 
system  to  the  villages,  where  traditional  peasant  justice  contin- 
ued to  operate  with  minimal  interference  from  provincial  offi- 
cials. In  addition,  the  regime  instructed  judges  to  decide  each 
case  on  its  merits  and  not  to  use  precedents,  which  would  have 
enabled  them  to  construct  a  body  of  law  independent  of  state 
authority. 


35 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Other  major  reforms  took  place  in  the  educational  and  cul- 
tural spheres.  The  accession  of  Alexander  II  brought  a  social 
restructuring  that  required  a  public  discussion  of  issues  and 
the  lifting  of  some  types  of  censorship.  When  an  attempt  was 
made  to  assassinate  the  tsar  in  1866,  the  government  reinstated 
censorship,  but  not  with  the  severity  of  pre-1855  control.  The 
government  also  put  restrictions  on  universities  in  1866,  five 
years  after  they  had  gained  autonomy.  The  central  government 
attempted  to  act  through  the  zemstva  to  establish  uniform  cur- 
ricula for  elementary  schools  and  to  impose  conservative  poli- 
cies, but  it  lacked  resources.  Because  many  liberal  teachers  and 
school  officials  were  only  nominally  subject  to  the  reactionary 
Ministry  of  Education,  however,  the  regime's  educational 
achievements  were  mixed  after  1866. 

In  the  financial  sphere,  Russia  established  the  State  Bank  in 
1866,  which  put  the  national  currency  on  a  firmer  footing.  The 
Ministry  of  Finance  supported  railroad  development,  which 
facilitated  vital  export  activity,  but  it  was  cautious  and  moderate 
in  its  foreign  ventures.  The  ministry  also  founded  the  Peasant 
Land  Bank  in  1882  to  enable  enterprising  farmers  to  acquire 
more  land.  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  countered  this  pol- 
icy, however,  by  establishing  the  Nobles'  Land  Bank  in  1885  to 
forestall  foreclosures  of  mortgages. 

The  regime  also  sought  to  reform  the  military.  One  of  the 
chief  reasons  for  the  emancipation  of  the  serfs  was  to  facilitate 
the  transition  from  a  large  standing  army  to  a  reserve  army  by 
instituting  territorial  levies  and  mobilization  in  times  of  need. 
Before  emancipation,  serfs  could  not  receive  military  training 
and  then  return  to  their  owners.  Bureaucratic  inertia,  however, 
obstructed  military  reform  until  the  Franco-Prussian  War 
(1870-71)  demonstrated  the  necessity  of  building  a  modern 
army.  The  levy  system  introduced  in  1874  gave  the  army  a  role 
in  teaching  many  peasants  to  read  and  in  pioneering  medical 
education  for  women.  But  the  army  remained  backward 
despite  these  military  reforms.  Officers  often  preferred  bayo- 
nets to  bullets,  expressing  worry  that  long-range  sights  on  rifles 
would  induce  cowardice.  In  spite  of  some  notable  achieve- 
ments, Russia  did  not  keep  pace  with  Western  technological 
developments  in  the  construction  of  rifles,  machine  guns,  artil- 
lery, ships,  and  naval  ordnance.  Russia  also  failed  to  use  naval 
modernization  as  a  means  of  developing  its  industrial  base  in 
the  1860s.

Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

In  1881  revolutionaries  assassinated  Alexander  II.  His  son 
Alexander  III  (r.  1881-94)  initiated  a  period  of  political  reac- 
tion, which  intensified  a  counterreform  movement  that  had 
begun  in  1866.  He  strengthened  the  security  police,  reorganiz- 
ing it  into  an  agency  known  as  the  Okhrana,  gave  it  extraordi- 
nary powers,  and  placed  it  under  the  Ministry  of  Internal 
Affairs.  Dmitriy  Tolstoy,  Alexander's  minister  of  internal  affairs, 
instituted  the  use  of  land  captains,  who  were  noble  overseers  of 
districts,  and  he  restricted  the  power  of  the  zemstva  and  the 
dumy.  Alexander  III  assigned  his  former  tutor,  the  reactionary 
Konstantin  Pobedonostsev,  to  be  the  procurator  of  the  Holy 
Synod  of  the  Orthodox  Church  and  Ivan  Delyanov  to  be  the 
minister  of  education.  In  their  attempts  to  "save"  Russia  from 
"modernism,"  they  revived  religious  censorship,  persecuted 
non-Orthodox  and  non-Russian  populations,  fostered  anti- 
Semitism,  and  suppressed  the  autonomy  of  the  universities. 
Their  attacks  on  liberal  and  non-Russian  elements  alienated 
large  segments  of  the  population.  The  nationalities,  particu- 
larly Poles,  Finns,  Latvians,  Lithuanians,  and  Ukrainians, 
reacted  to  the  regime's  efforts  to  Russify  them  by  intensifying 
their  own  nationalism.  Many  Jews  emigrated  or  joined  radical 
movements.  Secret  organizations  and  political  movements  con- 
tinued to  develop  despite  the  regime's  efforts  to  quell  them. 

Foreign  Affairs  after  the  Crimean  War 

After  the  Crimean  War,  Russia  pursued  cautious  and  well-cal- 
culated foreign  policies  until  nationalist  passions  and  another 
Balkan  crisis  almost  caused  a  catastrophic  war  in  the  late  1870s. 
The  1856  Treaty  of  Paris,  signed  at  the  end  of  the  Crimean  War, 
had  demilitarized  the  Black  Sea  and  deprived  Russia  of  south- 
ern Bessarabia  and  a  narrow  strip  of  land  at  the  mouth  of  the 
Danube  River.  The  treaty  gave  the  West  European  powers  the 
nominal  duty  of  protecting  Christians  living  in  the  Ottoman 
Empire,  removing  that  role  from  Russia,  which  had  been  desig- 
nated as  such  a  protector  in  the  1774  Treaty  of  Kuchuk-Kai- 
narji.  Russia's  primary  goal  during  the  first  phase  of  Alexander 
IPs  foreign  policy  was  to  alter  the  Treaty  of  Paris  to  regain  naval 
access  to  the  Black  Sea.  Russian  statesmen  viewed  Britain  and 
Austria  (redesignated  as  Austria-Hungary  in  1867)  as  opposed 
to  that  goal,  so  foreign  policy  concentrated  on  good  relations 
with  France,  Prussia,  and  the  United  States.  Prussia  (Germany 
as  of  1871)  replaced  Britain  as  Russia's  chief  banker  in  this 
period.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Following  the  Crimean  War,  the  regime  revived  its  expan- 
sionist policies.  Russian  troops  first  moved  to  gain  control  of 
the  Caucasus  region,  where  the  revolts  of  Muslim  tribesmen — 
Chechens,  Cherkess,  and  Dagestanis — had  continued  despite 
numerous  Russian  campaigns  in  the  nineteenth  century.  Once 
the  forces  of  Aleksandr  Baryatinskiy  had  captured  the  legend- 
ary Chechen  rebel  leader  Shamil  in  1859,  the  army  resumed 
the  expansion  into  Central  Asia  that  had  begun  under  Nicho- 
las I.  The  capture  of  Tashkent  was  a  significant  victory  over  the 
Quqon  (Kokand)  Khanate,  part  of  which  was  annexed  in  1866. 
By  1867  Russian  forces  had  captured  enough  territory  to  form 
the  Guberniya  (Governorate  General)  of  Turkestan,  the  capital 
of  which  was  Tashkent.  The  Bukhoro  (Bukhara)  Khanate  then 
lost  the  crucial  Samarqand  area  to  Russian  forces  in  1868.  To 
avoid  alarming  Britain,  which  had  strong  interests  in  protect- 
ing nearby  India,  Russia  left  the  Bukhoran  territories  directly 
bordering  Afghanistan  and  Persia  nominally  independent.  The 
Central  Asian  khanates  retained  a  degree  of  autonomy  until 
1917. 

Russia  followed  the  United  States,  Britain,  and  France  in 
establishing  relations  with  Japan,  and,  together  with  Britain 
and  France,  Russia  obtained  concessions  from  China  conse- 
quent to  the  Second  Opium  War  (1856-60).  Under  the  Treaty 
of  Aigun  in  1858  and  the  Treaty  of  Beijing  in  1860,  China 
ceded  to  Russia  extensive  trading  rights  and  regions  adjacent 
to  the  Amur  and  Ussuri  rivers  and  allowed  Russia  to  begin 
building  a  port  and  naval  base  at  Vladivostok.  Meanwhile,  in 
1867  the  logic  of  the  balance  of  power  and  the  cost  of  develop- 
ing and  defending  the  Amur-Ussuri  region  dictated  that  Russia 
sell  Alaska  to  the  United  States  in  order  to  acquire  much- 
needed  funds. 

As  part  of  the  regime's  foreign  policy  goals  in  Europe,  Russia 
initially  gave  guarded  support  to  France's  anti-Austrian  diplo- 
macy. A  weak  Franco-Russian  entente  soured,  however,  when 
France  backed  a  Polish  uprising  against  Russian  rule  in  1863. 
Russia  then  aligned  itself  more  closely  with  Prussia  by  approv- 
ing the  unification  of  Germany  in  exchange  for  a  revision  of 
the  Treaty  of  Paris  and  the  remilitarization  of  the  Black  Sea. 
These  diplomatic  achievements  came  at  a  London  conference 
in  1871,  following  France's  defeat  in  the  Franco-Prussian  War. 
After  1871  Germany,  united  under  Prussian  leadership,  was  the 
strongest  continental  power  in  Europe.  In  1873  Germany 
formed  the  loosely  knit  League  of  the  Three  Emperors  with 


38 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

Russia  and  Austria-Hungary  to  prevent  them  from  forming  an 
alliance  with  France.  Nevertheless,  Austro-Hungarian  and  Rus- 
sian ambitions  clashed  in  the  Balkans,  where  rivalries  among 
Slavic  nationalities  and  anti-Ottoman  sentiments  seethed.  In 
the  1870s,  Russian  nationalist  opinion  became  a  serious  domes- 
tic factor  in  its  support  for  liberating  Balkan  Christians  from 
Ottoman  rule  and  making  Bulgaria  and  Serbia  quasi-protector- 
ates  of  Russia.  From  1875  to  1877,  the  Balkan  crisis  escalated 
with  rebellions  in  Bosnia,  Herzegovina,  and  Bulgaria,  which 
the  Ottoman  Turks  suppressed  with  such  great  cruelty  that  Ser- 
bia, but  none  of  the  West  European  powers,  declared  war. 

In  early  1877,  Russia  came  to  the  rescue  of  beleaguered  Ser- 
bian and  Russian  volunteer  forces  when  it  went  to  war  with  the 
Ottoman  Empire.  Within  one  year,  Russian  troops  were  near- 
ing  Constantinople,  and  the  Ottomans  surrendered.  Russia's 
nationalist  diplomats  and  generals  persuaded  Alexander  II  to 
force  the  Ottomans  to  sign  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  in  March 
1878,  creating  an  enlarged,  independent  Bulgaria  that 
stretched  into  the  southwestern  Balkans.  When  Britain  threat- 
ened to  declare  war  over  the  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  San  Ste- 
fano, an  exhausted  Russia  backed  down.  At  the  Congress  of 
Berlin  in  July  1878,  Russia  agreed  to  the  creation  of  a  smaller 
Bulgaria.  Russian  nationalists  were  furious  with  Austria-Hun- 
gary and  Germany  for  failing  to  back  Russia,  but  the  tsar 
accepted  a  revived  and  strengthened  League  of  the  Three 
Emperors  as  well  as  Austro-Hungarian  hegemony  in  the  west- 
ern Balkans. 

Russian  diplomatic  and  military  interests  subsequently 
returned  to  Central  Asia,  where  Russia  had  quelled  a  series  of 
uprisings  in  the  1870s,  and  Russia  incorporated  hitherto  inde- 
pendent amirates  into  the  empire.  Britain  renewed  its  con- 
cerns in  1881  when  Russian  troops  occupied  Turkmen  lands 
on  the  Persian  and  Afghan  borders,  but  Germany  lent  diplo- 
matic support  to  Russian  advances,  and  an  Anglo-Russian  war 
was  averted.  Meanwhile,  Russia's  sponsorship  of  Bulgarian 
independence  brought  negative  results  as  the  Bulgarians, 
angry  at  Russia's  continuing  interference  in  domestic  affairs, 
sought  the  support  of  Austria-Hungary.  In  the  dispute  that 
arose  between  Austria-Hungary  and  Russia,  Germany  took  a 
firm  position  toward  Russia  while  mollifying  the  tsar  with  a 
bilateral  defensive  alliance,  the  Reinsurance  Treaty  of  1887 
between  Germany  and  Russia.  Within  a  year,  Russo-German 
acrimony  led  to  Bismarck's  forbidding  further  loans  to  Russia, 


39 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

and  France  replaced  Germany  as  Russia's  financier.  When  Kai- 
ser Wilhelm  II  dismissed  Bismarck  in  1890,  the  loose  Russo- 
Prussian  entente  collapsed  after  having  lasted  for  more  than 
twenty-five  years.  Three  years  later,  Russia  allied  itself  with 
France  by  entering  into  a  joint  military  convention,  which 
matched  the  dual  alliance  formed  in  1879  by  Germany  and 
Au  stri  a-Hu  ngar  y. 

The  Rise  of  Revolutionary  Movements 

Alexander  II's  reforms,  particularly  the  lifting  of  state  cen- 
sorship, fostered  the  expression  of  political  and  social  thought. 
The  regime  relied  on  journals  and  newspapers  to  gain  support 
for  its  domestic  and  foreign  policies.  But  liberal,  nationalist, 
and  radical  writers  also  helped  to  mold  public  opinion  that  was 
opposed  to  tsarism,  private  property,  and  the  imperial  state. 
Because  many  intellectuals,  professionals,  peasants,  and  work- 
ers shared  these  opposition  sentiments,  the  regime  regarded 
the  publications  and  the  radical  organizations  as  dangerous. 
From  the  1860s  through  the  1880s,  Russian  radicals,  collec- 
tively known  as  Populists  (Narodniki),  focused  chiefly  on  the 
peasantry,  whom  they  identified  as  "the  people"  (narod). 

The  leaders  of  the  Populist  movement  included  radical  writ- 
ers, idealists,  and  advocates  of  terrorism.  In  the  1860s,  Nikolay 
Chernyshevskiy,  the  most  important  radical  writer  of  the 
period,  posited  that  Russia  could  bypass  capitalism  and  move 
directly  to  socialism  (see  Glossary).  His  most  influential  work, 
What  Is  to  Be  Done?  (1861),  describes  the  role  of  an  individual  of 
a  "superior  nature"  who  guides  a  new,  revolutionary  genera- 
tion. Other  radicals  such  as  the  incendiary  anarchist  Mikhail 
Bakunin  and  his  terrorist  collaborator,  Sergey  Nechayev,  urged 
direct  action.  The  calmer  Petr  Tkachev  argued  against  the 
advocates  of  Marxism  (see  Glossary),  maintaining  that  a  cen- 
tralized revolutionary  band  had  to  seize  power  before  capital- 
ism could  fully  develop.  Disputing  his  views,  the  moralist  and 
individualist  Petr  Lavrov  made  a  call  "to  the  people,"  which 
hundreds  of  idealists  heeded  in  1873  and  1874  by  leaving  their 
schools  for  the  countryside  to  try  to  generate  a  mass  movement 
among  the  narod.  The  Populist  campaign  failed,  however,  when 
the  peasants  showed  hostility  to  the  urban  idealists  and  the  gov- 
ernment began  to  consider  nationalist  opinion  more  seriously. 

The  radicals  reconsidered  their  approach,  and  in  1876  they 
formed  a  propagandist  organization  called  Land  and  Liberty 
(Zemlya  i  volya),  which  leaned  toward  terrorism.  This  orienta- 


40 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

tion  became  stronger  three  years  later,  when  the  group 
renamed  itself  the  People's  Will  (Narodnaya  volya),  the  name 
under  which  the  radicals  were  responsible  for  the  assassination 
of  Alexander  II  in  1881.  In  1879  Georgiy  Plekhanov  formed  a 
propagandist  faction  of  Land  and  Liberty  called  Black  Reparti- 
tion (Chernyy  peredel),  which  advocated  redistributing  all 
land  to  the  peasantry.  This  group  studied  Marxism,  which,  par- 
adoxically, was  principally  concerned  with  urban  industrial 
workers.  The  People's  Will  remained  underground,  but  in 
1887  a  young  member  of  the  group,  Aleksandr  Ul'yanov, 
attempted  to  assassinate  Alexander  III,  and  authorities  arrested 
and  executed  him.  The  execution  greatly  affected  Vladimir 
Ul'yanov,  Aleksandr's  brother.  Influenced  by  Chernyshevskiy's 
writings,  Vladimir  joined  the  People's  Will,  and  later,  inspired 
by  Plekhanov,  he  converted  to  Marxism.  The  younger  Ul'yanov 
later  changed  his  name  to  Lenin. 

Witte  and  Accelerated  Industrialization 

In  the  late  1800s,  Russia's  domestic  backwardness  and  vul- 
nerability in  foreign  affairs  reached  crisis  proportions.  At  home 
a  famine  claimed  a  half-million  lives  in  1891,  and  activities  by 
Japan  and  China  near  Russia's  borders  were  perceived  as 
threats  from  abroad.  In  reaction,  the  regime  was  forced  to 
adopt  the  ambitious  but  costly  economic  programs  of  Sergey 
Witte,  the  country's  strong-willed  minister  of  finance.  Witte 
championed  foreign  loans,  conversion  to  the  gold  standard, 
heavy  taxation  of  the  peasantry,  accelerated  development  of 
heavy  industry,  and  a  trans-Siberian  railroad.  These  policies 
were  designed  to  modernize  the  country,  secure  the  Russian 
Far  East,  and  give  Russia  a  commanding  position  with  which  to 
exploit  the  resources  of  China's  northern  territories,  Korea, 
and  Siberia.  This  expansionist  foreign  policy  was  Russia's  ver- 
sion of  the  imperialist  logic  displayed  in  the  nineteenth  cen- 
tury by  other  large  countries  with  vast  undeveloped  territories 
such  as  the  United  States.  In  1894  the  accession  of  the  pliable 
Nicholas  II  upon  the  death  of  Alexander  III  gave  Witte  and 
other  powerful  ministers  the  opportunity  to  dominate  the  gov- 
ernment. 

Witte's  policies  had  mixed  results.  In  spite  of  a  severe  eco- 
nomic depression  at  the  end  of  the  century,  Russia's  coal,  iron, 
steel,  and  oil  production  tripled  between  1890  and  1900.  Rail- 
road mileage  almost  doubled,  giving  Russia  the  most  track  of 
any  nation  other  than  the  United  States.  Yet  Russian  grain  pro- 


41 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

duction  and  exports  failed  to  rise  significantly,  and  imports 
grew  faster  than  exports.  The  state  budget  also  more  than  dou- 
bled, absorbing  some  of  the  country's  economic  growth.  West- 
ern historians  differ  as  to  the  merits  of  Witte's  reforms;  some 
believe  that  domestic  industry,  which  did  not  benefit  from  sub- 
sidies or  contracts,  suffered  a  setback.  Most  analysts  agree  that 
the  Trans-Siberian  Railroad  (which  was  completed  from  Mos- 
cow to  Vladivostok  in  1904)  and  the  ventures  into  Manchuria 
and  Korea  were  economic  losses  for  Russia  and  a  drain  on  the 
treasury.  Certainly  the  financial  costs  of  his  reforms  contrib- 
uted to  Witte's  dismissal  as  minister  of  finance  in  1903. 

Radical  Political  Parties  Develop 

During  the  1890s,  Russia's  industrial  development  led  to  a 
significant  increase  in  the  size  of  the  urban  bourgeoisie  and 
the  working  class,  setting  the  stage  for  a  more  dynamic  political 
atmosphere  and  the  development  of  radical  parties.  Because 
the  state  and  foreigners  owned  much  of  Russia's  industry,  the 
working  class  was  comparatively  stronger  and  the  bourgeoisie 
comparatively  weaker  than  in  the  West.  The  working  class  and 
peasants  were  the  first  to  establish  political  parties  because  the 
nobility  and  the  wealthy  bourgeoisie  were  politically  timid. 
During  the  1890s  and  early  1900s,  abysmal  living  and  working 
conditions,  high  taxes,  and  land  hunger  gave  rise  to  more  fre- 
quent strikes  and  agrarian  disorders.  These  activities  prompted 
the  bourgeoisie  of  various  nationalities  in  the  empire  to 
develop  a  host  of  different  parties,  both  liberal  and  conserva- 
tive. 

Socialists  of  different  nationalities  formed  their  own  parties. 
Russian  Poles,  who  had  suffered  significant  administrative  and 
educational  Russification,  founded  the  nationalistic  Polish 
Socialist  Party  in  Paris  in  1892.  That  party's  founders  hoped 
that  it  would  help  reunite  a  divided  Poland  with  the  territories 
held  by  Austria-Hungary,  Germany,  and  Russia.  In  1897  Jewish 
workers  in  Russia  created  the  Bund  (league  or  union),  an 
organization  that  subsequently  became  popular  in  western 
Ukraine,  Belorussia,  Lithuania,  and  Russian  Poland.  The  Rus- 
sian Social  Democratic  Labor  Party  was  established  in  1898. 
The  Finnish  Social  Democrats  remained  separate,  but  the 
Latvians  and  Georgians  associated  themselves  with  the  Russian 
Social  Democrats.  Armenians,  inspired  by  both  Russian  and 
Balkan  revolutionary  traditions,  were  politically  active  in  this 
period  in  Russia  and  in  the  Ottoman  Empire.  Politically 


42 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

minded  Muslims  living  in  Russia  tended  to  be  attracted  to  the 
pan-Islamic  and  pan-Turkic  movements  that  were  developing 
in  Egypt  and  the  Ottoman  Empire.  Russians  who  fused  the 
ideas  of  the  old  Populists  and  urban  socialists  formed  Russia's 
largest  radical  movement,  the  United  Socialist  Revolutionary 
Party,  which  combined  the  standard  Populist  mix  of  propa- 
ganda and  terrorist  activities. 

Vladimir  I.  Ul'yanov  was  the  most  politically  talented  of  the 
revolutionary  socialists.  In  the  1890s,  he  labored  to  wean  young 
radicals  away  from  populism  to  Marxism.  Exiled  from  1895  to 
1899  in  Siberia,  where  he  took  the  name  Lenin  from  the 
mighty  Siberian  Lena  River,  he  was  the  master  tactician  among 
the  organizers  of  the  Russian  Social  Democratic  Labor  Party.  In 
December  1900,  he  founded  the  newspaper  Iskra  (Spark).  In 
his  book  What  Is  to  Be  Done?  (1902),  Lenin  developed  the  the- 
ory that  a  newspaper  published  abroad  could  aid  in  organizing 
a  centralized  revolutionary  party  to  direct  the  overthrow  of  an 
autocratic  government.  He  then  worked  to  establish  a  tightly 
organized,  highly  disciplined  party  to  do  so  in  Russia.  At  the 
Second  Party  Congress  of  the  Russian  Social  Democratic  Labor 
Party  in  1903,  he  forced  the  Bund  to  walk  out  and  induced  a 
split  between  his  majority  Bolshevik  (see  Glossary)  faction  and 
the  minority  Menshevik  (see  Glossary)  faction,  which  believed 
more  in  worker  spontaneity  than  in  strict  organizational  tactics. 
Lenin's  concept  of  a  revolutionary  party  and  a  worker-peasant 
alliance  owed  more  to  Tkachev  and  to  the  People's  Will  than  to 
Karl  Marx  and  Friedrich  Engels,  the  developers  of  Marxism. 
Young  Bolsheviks,  such  as  Joseph  V.  Stalin  and  Nikolay 
Bukharin,  looked  to  Lenin  as  their  leader. 

Imperialism  in  Asia  and  the  Russo-Japanese  War 

At  the  turn  of  the  century,  Russia  gained  room  to  maneuver 
in  Asia  because  of  its  alliance  with  France  and  the  growing 
rivalry  between  Britain  and  Germany.  Tsar  Nicholas  failed  to 
orchestrate  a  coherent  Far  Eastern  policy  because  of  ministe- 
rial conflicts,  however.  Russia's  uncoordinated  and  aggressive 
moves  in  the  region  ultimately  led  to  the  Russo-Japanese  War 
(1904-05). 

By  1895  Germany  was  competing  with  France  for  Russia's 
favor,  and  British  statesmen  hoped  to  negotiate  with  the  Rus- 
sians to  demarcate  spheres  of  influence  in  Asia.  This  situation 
enabled  Russia  to  intervene  in  northeastern  Asia  after  Japan's 
victory  over  China  in  1895.  In  the  negotiations  that  followed, 


43 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Japan  was  forced  to  make  concessions  in  the  Liaotung  Penin- 
sula and  Port  Arthur  in  southern  Manchuria.  The  next  year, 
Witte  used  French  capital  to  establish  the  Russo-Chinese  Bank. 
The  goal  of  the  bank  was  to  finance  the  construction  of  a  rail- 
road across  northern  Manchuria  and  thus  shorten  the  Trans- 
Siberian  Railroad.  Within  two  years,  Russia  had  acquired  leases 
on  the  Liaotung  Peninsula  and  Port  Arthur  and  had  begun 
building  a  trunk  line  from  Harbin  in  central  Manchuria  to  Port 
Arthur  on  the  coast. 

In  1900  China  reacted  to  foreign  encroachments  on  its  terri- 
tory with  an  armed  popular  uprising,  the  Boxer  Rebellion.  Rus- 
sian military  contingents  joined  forces  from  Europe,  Japan, 
and  the  United  States  to  restore  order  in  northern  China.  A 
force  of  180,000  Russian  troops  fought  to  pacify  part  of  Man- 
churia and  to  secure  its  railroads.  The  Japanese  were  backed  by 
Britain  and  the  United  States,  however,  and  insisted  that  Russia 
evacuate  Manchuria.  Witte  and  some  Russian  diplomats 
wanted  to  compromise  with  Japan  and  trade  Manchuria  for 
Korea,  but  a  group  of  Witte's  reactionary  enemies,  courtiers, 
and  military  and  naval  leaders  refused  to  compromise.  The  tsar 
favored  their  viewpoint,  and,  disdaining  Japan's  threats — 
despite  the  latter's  formal  alliance  with  Britain — the  Russian 
government  equivocated  until  Japan  declared  war  in  early 
1904. 

In  the  war  that  followed,  Japan's  location,  technological 
superiority,  and  superior  morale  gave  it  command  of  the  seas, 
and  Russia's  sluggishness  and  incompetent  commanders 
caused  continuous  setbacks  on  land.  In  January  1905,  after  an 
eight-month  siege,  Russia  surrendered  Port  Arthur,  and  in 
March  the  Japanese  forced  the  Russians  to  withdraw  north  of 
Mukden.  In  May,  at  the  Tsushima  Straits,  the  Japanese 
destroyed  Russia's  last  hope  in  the  war,  a  fleet  assembled  from 
the  navy's  Baltic  and  Mediterranean  squadrons.  Theoretically, 
Russian  army  reinforcements  could  have  driven  the  Japanese 
from  the  Asian  mainland,  but  revolution  at  home  and  diplo- 
matic pressure  forced  the  tsar  to  seek  peace.  Russia  accepted 
mediation  by  United  States  president  Theodore  Roosevelt, 
ceded  southern  Sakhalin  Island  to  Japan,  and  acknowledged 
Japan's  ascendancy  in  Korea  and  southern  Manchuria. 

The  Last  Years  of  the  Autocracy 

The  Russojapanese  War  was  a  turning  point  in  Russian  his- 
tory. It  led  to  a  popular  uprising  against  the  government  that 


44 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 


forced  the  regime  to  respond  with  domestic  economic  and 
political  reforms.  In  the  same  period,  however,  counterreform 
and  special-interest  groups  exerted  increasing  influence  on  the 
regime's  policies.  In  foreign  affairs,  Russia  again  became  an 
intrusive  participant  in  Balkan  affairs  and  in  the  international 
political  intrigues  of  the  major  European  powers.  As  a  conse- 
quence of  its  foreign  policies,  Russia  was  drawn  into  a  world 
war  for  which  its  domestic  policies  rendered  it  unprepared. 
Severely  weakened  by  internal  turmoil  and  lacking  leadership, 
the  regime  ultimately  was  unable  to  overcome  the  traumatic 
events  that  would  lead  to  the  fall  of  tsarism  and  initiate  a  new 
era  in  Russian  and  world  history. 

Revolution  and  Counterrevolution,  1905-07 

The  Russo-Japanese  War  accelerated  the  rise  of  political 
movements  among  all  classes  and  the  major  nationalities, 
including  propertied  Russians.  By  early  1904,  Russian  liberal 
activists  from  the  zemstva  and  from  the  professions  had  formed 
an  organization  called  the  Union  of  Liberation.  In  the  same 
year,  they  joined  with  Finns,  Poles,  Georgians,  Armenians,  and 
Russian  members  of  the  Socialist  Revolutionary  Party  to  form 
an  antiautocratic  alliance. 

In  January  1905,  Father  Georgiy  Gapon,  a  Russian  Orthodox 
priest  who  headed  a  police-sponsored  workers'  association,  led 
a  huge,  peaceful  march  in  St.  Petersburg  to  present  a  petition 
to  the  tsar.  Nervous  troops  responded  to  the  throng  with  gun- 
fire, killing  several  hundred  people  and  initiating  the  Revolu- 
tion of  1905.  This  event,  which  came  to  be  called  Bloody 
Sunday,  combined  with  the  embarrassing  failures  in  the  war 
with  Japan  to  prompt  more  strikes,  agrarian  disorders,  army 
mutinies,  and  terrorist  acts  organized  by  opposition  groups. 
Workers  formed  a  council,  or  soviet,  in  St.  Petersburg.  Armed 
uprisings  occurred  in  Moscow,  the  Urals,  Latvia,  and  parts  of 
Poland.  Activists  from  the  zemstva  and  the  broad  professional 
Union  of  Unions  formed  the  Constitutional  Democratic  Party, 
whose  initials  lent  the  party  its  informal  name,  the  Kadets. 

Some  upper-class  and  propertied  activists  called  for  compro- 
mise with  opposition  groups  to  avoid  further  disorders.  In  late 
1905,  Witte  pressured  Nicholas  to  issue  the  so-called  October 
Manifesto,  which  gave  Russia  a  constitution  and  proclaimed 
basic  civil  liberties  for  all  citizens.  In  an  effort  to  stop  the  activ- 
ity of  liberal  factions,  the  constitution  included  most  of  their 
demands,  including  a  ministerial  government  responsible  to 


45 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

the  tsar,  and  a  national  Duma  (see  Glossary) — a  parliament  to 
be  elected  on  a  broad,  but  not  wholly  equitable,  franchise. 
Those  who  accepted  this  arrangement  formed  a  center-right 
political  party,  the  Octobrists,  and  named  Witte  the  first  prime 
minister.  Meanwhile,  the  Kadets  held  out  for  a  ministerial  gov- 
ernment and  equal,  universal  suffrage.  Because  of  their  politi- 
cal principles  and  continued  armed  uprisings,  Russia's  leftist 
parties  were  undecided  whether  to  participate  in  the  Duma 
elections,  which  had  been  called  for  early  1906.  At  the  same 
time,  rightist  factions  actively  opposed  the  reforms.  Several  new 
monarchist  and  protofascist  groups  also  arose  to  subvert  the 
new  order.  Nevertheless,  the  regime  continued  to  function 
through  the  chaotic  year  of  1905,  eventually  restoring  order  in 
the  cities,  the  countryside,  and  the  army.  In  the  process,  terror- 
ists murdered  several  thousand  officials,  and  the  government 
executed  an  equal  number  of  terrorists.  Because  the  govern- 
ment had  been  able  to  restore  order  and  to  secure  a  loan  from 
France  before  the  first  Duma  met,  Nicholas  was  in  a  strong 
position  that  enabled  him  to  replace  Witte  with  the  much  less 
independent  functionary  Petr  Stolypin. 

The  First  Duma  was  elected  in  March  1906.  The  Kadets  and 
their  allies  dominated  it,  with  the  mainly  nonparty  radical  left- 
ists slightly  weaker  than  the  Octobrists  and  the  nonparty  cen- 
ter-rightists combined.  The  socialists  had  boycotted  the 
election,  but  several  socialist  delegates  were  elected.  Relations 
between  the  Duma  and  the  Stolypin  government  were  hostile 
from  the  beginning.  A  deadlock  of  the  Kadets  and  the  govern- 
ment over  the  adoption  of  a  constitution  and  peasant  reform 
led  to  the  dissolution  of  the  Duma  and  the  scheduling  of  new 
elections.  In  spite  of  an  upsurge  of  leftist  terror,  radical  leftist 
parties  participated  in  the  election,  and,  together  with  the  non- 
party left,  they  gained  a  plurality  of  seats,  followed  by  a  loose 
coalition  of  Kadets  with  Poles  and  other  nationalities  in  the 
political  center.  The  impasse  continued,  however,  when  the 
Second  Duma  met  in  1907. 

The  Stolypin  and  Kokovtsov  Governments 

In  1907  Stolypin  instituted  a  series  of  major  reforms.  In  June 
1907,  he  dissolved  the  Second  Duma  and  promulgated  a  new 
electoral  law,  which  vastly  reduced  the  electoral  weight  of 
lower-class  and  non-Russian  voters  and  increased  the  weight  of 
the  nobility.  This  political  coup  had  the  desired  short-term 
result  of  restoring  order.  New  elections  in  the  fall  returned  a 


46 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

more  conservative  Third  Duma,  which  Octobrists  dominated. 
Even  this  Duma  quarreled  with  the  government  over  a  variety 
of  issues,  however,  including  the  composition  of  the  naval  staff, 
the  autonomous  status  of  Finland,  the  introduction  of  zemstva 
in  the  western  provinces,  the  reform  of  the  peasant  court  sys- 
tem, and  the  establishment  of  workers'  insurance  organizations 
under  police  supervision.  In  these  disputes,  the  Duma,  with  its 
appointed  aristocratic-bureaucratic  upper  house,  was  some- 
times more  conservative  than  the  government,  and  at  other 
times  it  was  more  constitutionally  minded.  The  Fourth  Duma, 
elected  in  1912,  was  similar  in  composition  to  the  third,  but  a 
progressive  faction  of  Octobrists  split  from  the  right  and  joined 
the  political  center. 

Stolypin's  boldest  measure  was  his  peasant  reform  program. 
It  allowed,  and  sometimes  forced,  the  breakup  of  communes  as 
well  as  the  establishment  of  full  private  property.  Stolypin 
hoped  that  the  reform  program  would  create  a  class  of  conser- 
vative landowning  farmers  loyal  to  the  tsar.  Most  peasants  did 
not  want  to  lose  the  safety  of  the  commune  or  to  permit  outsid- 
ers to  buy  village  land,  however.  By  1914  only  about  10  percent 
of  all  peasant  communes  had  been  dissolved.  Nevertheless,  the 
economy  recovered  and  grew  impressively  from  1907  to  1914, 
both  quantitatively  and  through  the  formation  of  rural  cooper- 
atives and  banks  and  the  generation  of  domestic  capital.  By 
1914  Russian  steel  production  equaled  that  of  France  and  Aus- 
tria-Hungary, and  Russia's  economic  growth  rate  was  one  of  the 
highest  in  the  world.  Although  external  debt  was  very  high,  it 
was  declining  as  a  percentage  of  the  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary),  and  the  empire's  overall  trade  balance 
was  favorable. 

In  1911  a  double  agent  working  for  the  Okhrana  assassi- 
nated Stolypin,  and  Finance  Minister  Vladimir  Kokovtsov 
replaced  him.  The  cautious  Kokovtsov  was  very  able  and  a  sup- 
porter of  the  tsar,  but  he  could  not  compete  with  the  powerful 
court  factions  that  dominated  the  government. 

Historians  have  debated  whether  Russia  had  the  potential  to 
develop  a  constitutional  government  between  1905  and  1914. 
The  failure  to  do  so  was  partly  because  the  tsar  was  not  willing 
to  give  up  autocratic  rule  or  share  power.  By  manipulating  the 
franchise,  the  government  obtained  progressively  more  conser- 
vative, but  less  representative,  Dumas.  Moreover,  the  regime 
sometimes  bypassed  the  conservative  Dumas  and  ruled  by 
decree. 


47 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

During  this  period,  the  government's  policies  waivered  from 
reformist  to  repressive.  Historians  have  speculated  about 
whether  Witte's  and  Stolypin's  bold  reform  plans  could  have 
"saved"  the  Russian  Empire.  But  court  politics,  together  with 
the  continuing  isolation  of  the  tsar  and  the  bureaucracy  from 
the  rest  of  society,  hampered  all  reforms.  Suspensions  of  civil 
liberties  and  the  rule  of  law  continued  in  many  places,  and  nei- 
ther workers  nor  the  Orthodox  Church  had  the  right  to  orga- 
nize themselves  as  they  chose.  Discrimination  against  Poles, 
Jews,  Ukrainians,  and  Old  Believers  was  common.  Domestic 
unrest  was  on  the  rise  while  the  empire's  foreign  policy  was 
becoming  more  adventurous. 

Active  Balkan  Policy,  1906-13 

Russia's  earlier  Far  Eastern  policy  required  holding  Balkan 
issues  in  abeyance,  a  strategy  Austria-Hungary  also  followed 
between  1897  and  1906.  Japan's  victory  in  1905  had  forced  Rus- 
sia to  make  deals  with  the  British  and  the  Japanese.  In  1907 
Russia's  new  foreign  minister,  Aleksandr  Izvol'skiy,  concluded 
agreements  with  both  nations.  To  maintain  its  sphere  of  influ- 
ence in  northern  Manchuria  and  northern  Persia,  Russia 
agreed  to  Japanese  ascendancy  in  southern  Manchuria  and 
Korea,  and  to  British  ascendancy  in  southern  Persia,  Afghani- 
stan, and  Tibet.  The  logic  of  this  policy  demanded  that  Russia 
and  Japan  unite  to  prevent  the  United  States  from  establishing 
a  base  in  China  by  organizing  a  consortium  to  develop  Chinese 
railroads.  After  China's  republican  revolution  of  1911,  Russia 
and  Japan  recognized  each  other's  spheres  of  influence  in 
Outer  Mongolia.  In  an  extension  of  this  reasoning,  Russia 
traded  recognition  of  German  economic  interests  in  the  Otto- 
man Empire  and  Persia  for  German  recognition  of  various  Rus- 
sian security  interests  in  the  region.  Russia  also  protected  its 
strategic  and  financial  position  by  entering  the  informal  Triple 
Entente  with  Britain  and  France,  without  antagonizing  Ger- 
many. 

In  spite  of  these  careful  measures,  after  the  Russo-Japanese 
War  Russia  and  Austria-Hungary  resumed  their  Balkan  rivalry, 
focusing  on  the  Kingdom  of  Serbia  and  the  provinces  of  Bosnia 
and  Herzegovina,  which  Austria-Hungary  had  occupied  since 
1878.  In  1881  Russia  secretly  had  agreed  in  principle  to  Aus- 
tria's future  annexation  of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina.  But  in 
1908,  Izvol'skiy  foolishly  consented  to  support  formal  annex- 
ation in  return  for  Austria's  support  for  revision  of  the  agree- 


48 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 


ment  on  the  neutrality  of  the  Bosporus  and  Dardanelles — a 
change  that  would  give  Russia  special  navigational  rights  of  pas- 
sage. Britain  stymied  the  Russian  gambit  by  blocking  the  revi- 
sion, but  Austria  proceeded  with  the  annexation.  Then,  backed 
by  German  threats  of  war,  Austria-Hungary  exposed  Russia's 
weakness  by  forcing  Russia  to  disavow  support  for  Serbia. 

After  Austria-Hungary's  annexation  of  Bosnia  and  Herzegov- 
ina, Russia  became  a  major  part  of  the  increased  tension  and 
conflict  in  the  Balkans.  In  1912  Bulgaria,  Serbia,  Greece,  and 
Montenegro  defeated  the  Ottoman  Empire  in  the  First  Balkan 
War,  but  the  putative  allies  continued  to  quarrel  among  them- 
selves. Then  in  1913,  the  alliance  split,  and  the  Serbs,  Greeks, 
and  Romanians  defeated  Bulgaria  in  the  Second  Balkan  War. 
Austria-Hungary  became  the  patron  of  Bulgaria,  which  now 
was  Serbia's  territorial  rival  in  the  region,  and  Germany 
remained  the  Ottoman  Empire's  protector.  Russia  tied  itself 
more  closely  to  Serbia  than  it  had  previously.  The  complex  sys- 
tem of  alliances  and  Great  Power  support  was  extremely  unsta- 
ble; among  the  Balkan  parties  harboring  resentments  over  past 
defeats,  the  Serbs  maintained  particular  animosity  toward  the 
Austro-Hungarian  annexation  of  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina. 

In  June  1914,  a  Serbian  terrorist  assassinated  Archduke 
Franz  Ferdinand,  heir  to  the  throne  of  Austria-Hungary,  which 
then  held  the  Serbian  government  responsible.  Austria-Hun- 
gary delivered  an  ultimatum  to  Serbia,  believing  that  the  terms 
were  too  humiliating  to  accept.  Although  Serbia  submitted  to 
the  ultimatum,  Austria-Hungary  declared  the  response  unsatis- 
factory and  recalled  its  ambassador.  Russia,  fearing  another 
humiliation  in  the  Balkans,  supported  Serbia.  Once  the  Ser- 
bian response  was  rejected,  the  system  of  alliances  began  to 
operate  automatically,  with  Germany  supporting  Austria-Hun- 
gary and  France  backing  Russia.  When  Germany  invaded 
France  through  Belgium,  the  conflict  escalated  into  a  world 
war. 

Russia  at  War,  1914-16 

Russia's  large  population  enabled  it  to  field  a  greater  num- 
ber of  troops  than  Austria-Hungary  and  Germany  combined, 
but  its  underdeveloped  industrial  base  meant  that  its  soldiers 
were  as  poorly  armed  as  those  of  the  Austro-Hungarian  army. 
Russian  forces  were  inferior  to  Germany's  in  every  respect 
except  numbers.  In  most  engagements,  the  larger  Russian 


49 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

armies  defeated  the  Austro-Hungarians  but  suffered  reverses 
against  German  forces. 

In  the  initial  phase  of  the  war,  Russia's  offensives  into  East 
Prussia  drew  enough  German  troops  from  the  western  front  to 
allow  the  French,  Belgians,  and  British  to  stop  the  German 
advance.  One  of  Russia's  two  invading  armies  was  almost  totally 
destroyed,  however,  at  the  disastrous  Battle  of  Tannenberg — 
the  same  site  at  which  Lithuanian,  Polish,  and  Russian  troops 
had  defeated  the  German  Teutonic  Knights  in  1410.  Mean- 
while, the  Russians  turned  back  an  Austrian  offensive  and 
pushed  into  eastern  Galicia,  the  northeastern  region  of  the 
Austro-Hungarian  Empire.  The  Russians  halted  a  combined 
German-Austrian  winter  counteroffensive  into  Russian  Poland, 
and  in  early  1915  they  pushed  more  deeply  into  Galicia.  Then 
in  the  spring  and  summer  of  that  year,  a  German-Austrian 
offensive  drove  the  Russians  out  of  Galicia  and  Poland  and 
destroyed  several  Russian  army  corps.  In  1916  the  Germans 
planned  to  drive  France  out  of  the  war  with  a  large-scale  attack 
in  the  Verdun  area,  but  a  new  Russian  offensive  against  Austria- 
Hungary  once  again  drew  German  troops  from  the  west.  These 
actions  left  both  major  fronts  stable  and  both  Russia  and  Ger- 
many despairing  of  victory — Russia  because  of  exhaustion,  Ger- 
many because  of  its  opponents'  superior  resources.  Toward  the 
end  of  1916,  Russia  came  to  the  rescue  of  Romania,  which  had 
just  entered  the  war,  and  extended  the  eastern  front  south  to 
the  Black  Sea. 

Wartime  agreements  among  the  Allies  reflected  the  Triple 
Entente's  imperialist  aims  and  the  Russian  Empire's  relative 
weakness  outside  Eastern  Europe.  Russia  nonetheless  expected 
impressive  gains  from  a  victory:  territorial  acquisitions  in  east- 
ern Galicia  from  Austria,  in  East  Prussia  from  Germany,  and  in 
Armenia  from  the  Ottoman  Empire,  which  joined  the  war  on 
the  German  side;  control  of  Constantinople  and  the  Bosporus 
and  Dardanelles  straits;  and  territorial  and  political  alteration 
of  Austria-Hungary  in  the  interests  of  Romania  and  the  Slavic 
peoples  of  the  region.  Britain  was  to  acquire  the  middle  zone 
of  Persia  and  share  much  of  the  Arab  Middle  East  with  France; 
Italy — not  Russia's  ally  Serbia — was  to  acquire  Dalmatia  along 
the  Adriatic  coast;  Japan,  another  ally  of  the  entente,  was  to 
control  more  territory  in  China;  and  France  was  to  regain 
Alsace-Lorraine,  which  it  had  lost  to  Germany  in  the  Franco- 
Prussian  War,  and  to  have  increased  influence  in  western  Ger- 
many.

Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1917 

The  Fatal  Weakening  of  Tsarism 

The  onset  of  World  War  I  exposed  the  weakness  of  Nicholas 
II's  government.  A  show  of  national  unity  had  accompanied 
Russia's  entrance  into  the  war,  with  defense  of  the  Slavic  Serbs 
the  main  battle  cry.  In  the  summer  of  1914,  the  Duma  and  the 
zemstva  expressed  full  support  for  the  government's  war  effort. 
The  initial  conscription  was  well  organized  and  peaceful,  and 
the  early  phase  of  Russia's  military  buildup  showed  that  the 
empire  had  learned  lessons  from  the  Russojapanese  War.  But 
military  reversals  and  the  government's  incompetence  soon 
soured  much  of  the  population.  German  control  of  the  Baltic 
Sea  and  German-Ottoman  control  of  the  Black  Sea  severed 
Russia  from  most  of  its  foreign  supplies  and  potential  markets. 
In  addition,  inept  Russian  preparations  for  war  and  ineffective 
economic  policies  hurt  the  country  financially,  logistically,  and 
militarily.  Inflation  became  a  serious  problem.  Because  of  inad- 
equate materiel  support  for  military  operations,  the  War  Indus- 
tries Committee  was  formed  to  ensure  that  necessary  supplies 
reached  the  front.  But  army  officers  quarreled  with  civilian 
leaders,  seized  administrative  control  of  front  areas,  and 
refused  to  cooperate  with  the  committee.  The  central  govern- 
ment distrusted  the  independent  war  support  activities  that 
were  organized  by  zemstva  and  cities.  The  Duma  quarreled  with 
the  war  bureaucracy  of  the  government,  and  center  and  center- 
left  deputies  eventually  formed  the  Progressive  Bloc  to  create  a 
genuinely  constitutional  government. 

After  Russian  military  reversals  in  1915,  Nicholas  II  went  to 
the  front  to  assume  nominal  leadership  of  the  army,  leaving 
behind  his  German-born  wife,  Alexandra,  and  Rasputin,  a 
member  of  her  entourage,  who  exercised  influence  on  policy 
and  ministerial  appointments.  Rasputin  was  a  debauched  faith 
healer  who  initially  impressed  Alexandra  because  he  was  able 
to  stop  the  bleeding  of  the  royal  couple's  hemophiliac  son  and 
heir  presumptive.  Although  their  true  influence  has  been 
debated,  Alexandra  and  Rasputin  undoubtedly  decreased  the 
regime's  prestige  and  credibility. 

While  the  central  government  was  hampered  by  court 
intrigue,  the  strain  of  the  war  began  to  cause  popular  unrest.  In 
1916  high  food  prices  and  fuel  shortages  caused  strikes  in  some 
cities.  Workers,  who  had  won  the  right  to  representation  in  sec- 
tions of  the  War  Industries  Committee,  used  those  sections  as 
organs  of  political  opposition.  The  countryside  also  was  becom- 
ing restive.  Soldiers  were  increasingly  insubordinate,  particu-

larly  the  newly  recruited  peasants  who  faced  the  prospect  of 
being  used  as  cannon  fodder  in  the  inept  conduct  of  the  war. 

The  situation  continued  to  deteriorate.  In  an  attempt  to  alle- 
viate the  morass  at  the  tsar's  court,  a  group  of  nobles  murdered 
Rasputin  in  December  1916.  But  the  death  of  the  mysterious 
"healer"  brought  little  change.  Increasing  conflict  between  the 
tsar  and  the  Duma  weakened  both  parts  of  the  government 
and  increased  the  impression  of  incompetence.  In  early  1917, 
deteriorating  rail  transport  caused  acute  food  and  fuel  short- 
ages, which  resulted  in  riots  and  strikes.  Authorities  summoned 
troops  to  quell  the  disorders  in  Petrograd  (as  St.  Petersburg 
had  been  called  since  1914,  to  Russianize  the  Germanic  name). 
In  1905  troops  had  fired  on  demonstrators  and  saved  the  mon- 
archy, but  in  1917  the  troops  turned  their  guns  over  to  the 
angry  crowds.  Public  support  for  the  tsarist  regime  simply  evap- 
orated in  1917,  ending  three  centuries  of  Romanov  rule.

THE  HISTORY  OF  RUSSIA  between  1922  and  1991  is  essen- 
tially the  history  of  the  Soviet  Union  (the  Union  of  Soviet 
Socialist  Republics — USSR).  This  ideologically  based  empire 
was  roughly  coterminous  with  the  Russian  Empire,  whose  last 
monarch,  Tsar  Nicholas  II,  ruled  until  1917.  The  Soviet  Union 
was  established  in  December  1922  by  the  leaders  of  the  Russian 
Communist  Party  (Bolshevik).  At  that  time,  the  new  nation 
included  the  Russian,  Ukrainian,  Belorussian,  and  Transcauca- 
sian  republics. 

A  spontaneous  popular  uprising  in  Petrograd,  in  response  to 
the  wartime  decay  of  Russia's  physical  well-being  and  morale, 
culminated  in  the  toppling  of  the  imperial  government  in 
March  1917.  Replacing  the  autocracy  was  the  Provisional  Gov- 
ernment, whose  leaders  intended  to  establish  democracy  in 
Russia  and  to  continue  participating  on  the  side  of  the  Allies  in 
World  War  I.  At  the  same  time,  to  ensure  the  rights  of  the  work- 
ing class,  workers'  councils,  known  as  Soviets,  sprang  up  across 
the  country.  The  radical  Bolsheviks,  led  by  Vladimir  I.  Lenin, 
agitated  for  socialist  revolution  in  the  Soviets  and  on  the  streets. 
They  seized  power  from  the  Provisional  Government  in 
November  1917.  Only  after  the  long  and  bloody  Civil  War  of 
1918-21,  which  included  combat  between  government  forces 
and  foreign  troops  in  several  parts  of  Russia,  was  the  new  com- 
munist regime  secure. 

From  its  first  years,  government  in  the  Soviet  Union  was 
based  on  the  one-party  rule  of  the  communists,  as  the  Bolshe- 
viks called  themselves  beginning  in  March  1918.  After  unsuc- 
cessfully attempting  to  centralize  the  economy  in  accordance 
with  Marxist  dogma  during  the  Civil  War,  the  Soviet  govern- 
ment permitted  some  private  enterprise  to  coexist  with  nation- 
alized industry  in  the  1920s.  Debate  over  the  future  of  the 
economy  provided  the  background  for  Soviet  leaders  to  con- 
tend for  power  in  the  years  after  Lenin's  death  in  1924.  By 
gradually  consolidating  his  influence  and  isolating  his  rivals 
within  the  party,  Joseph  V.  Stalin  became  the  sole  leader  of  the 
Soviet  Union  by  the  end  of  the  1920s. 

In  1928  Stalin  introduced  the  First  Five- Year  Plan  for  build- 
ing a  socialist  economy.  In  industry  the  state  assumed  control 
over  all  existing  enterprises  and  undertook  an  intensive  pro- 
gram of  industrialization;  in  agriculture  the  state  appropriated 


55 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

the  peasants'  property  to  establish  collective  farms.  The  plan's 
implementation  produced  widespread  misery,  including  the 
deaths  of  millions  of  peasants  by  starvation  or  directly  at  the 
hands  of  the  government  during  forced  collectivization.  Social 
upheaval  continued  in  the  mid-1980s,  when  Stalin  began  a 
purge  of  the  party;  out  of  this  process  grew  a  campaign  of  ter- 
ror that  led  to  the  execution  or  imprisonment  of  untold  mil- 
lions from  all  walks  of  life.  Yet  despite  this  turmoil,  the  Soviet 
Union  developed  a  powerful  industrial  economy  in  the  years 
before  World  War  II. 

Although  Stalin  tried  to  avert  war  with  Germany  by  conclud- 
ing the  Nazi-Soviet  Nonaggression  Pact  in  1939,  in  1941  Ger- 
many invaded  the  Soviet  Union.  The  Red  Army  stopped  the 
Nazi  offensive  at  the  Battle  of  Stalingrad  in  1943  and  drove 
through  Eastern  Europe  to  Berlin  before  Germany  surren- 
dered in  1945.  Although  ravaged  by  the  war,  the  Soviet  Union 
emerged  from  the  conflict  as  an  acknowledged  great  power. 

During  the  immediate  postwar  period,  the  Soviet  Union  first 
rebuilt  and  then  expanded  its  economy,  with  control  always 
exerted  exclusively  from  Moscow.  The  Soviet  Union  consoli- 
dated its  hold  on  Eastern  Europe,  supplied  aid  to  the  eventu- 
ally victorious  communists  in  China,  and  sought  to  expand  its 
influence  elsewhere  in  the  world.  This  active  foreign  policy 
helped  bring  about  the  Cold  War,  which  turned  the  Soviet 
Union's  wartime  allies,  Britain  and  the  United  States,  into  foes. 
Within  the  Soviet  Union,  repressive  measures  continued  in 
force;  Stalin  apparently  was  about  to  launch  a  new  purge  when 
he  died  in  1953. 

In  the  absence  of  an  acceptable  successor,  Stalin's  closest 
associates  opted  to  rule  the  Soviet  Union  jointly,  although  a 
struggle  for  power  took  place  behind  the  facade  of  collective 
leadership.  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev,  who  won  the  power  struggle 
by  the  mid-1950s,  denounced  Stalin's  use  of  terror  and  eased 
repressive  controls  over  party  and  society.  Khrushchev's 
reforms  in  agriculture  and  administration,  however,  were  gen- 
erally unproductive,  and  foreign  policy  toward  China  and  the 
United  States  suffered  reverses.  Khrushchev's  colleagues  in  the 
leadership  removed  him  from  power  in  1964. 

Following  the  ouster  of  Khrushchev,  another  period  of  rule 
by  collective  leadership  ensued,  lasting  until  Leonid  I.  Brezh- 
nev established  himself  in  the  early  1970s  as  the  preeminent 
figure  in  Soviet  political  life.  Brezhnev  presided  over  a  period 
of  detente  with  the  West  while  at  the  same  time  building  up 


56 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


Soviet  military  strength;  the  arms  buildup  contributed  to  the 
demise  of  detente  in  the  late  1970s.  Another  contributing  fac- 
tor was  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan  in  December  1979. 

After  some  experimentation  with  economic  reforms  in  the 
mid-1960s,  the  Soviet  leadership  reverted  to  established  means 
of  economic  management.  Industry  showed  slow  but  steady 
gains  during  the  1970s,  while  agricultural  development  contin- 
ued to  lag.  In  contrast  to  the  revolutionary  spirit  that  accompa- 
nied the  birth  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  prevailing  mood  of  the 
Soviet  leadership  at  the  time  of  Brezhnev's  death  in  1982  was 
one  of  aversion  to  change. 

Two  developments  dominated  the  decade  that  followed:  the 
increasingly  apparent  crumbling  of  the  Soviet  Union's  eco- 
nomic and  political  structures,  and  the  patchwork  attempts  at 
reforms  to  reverse  that  process.  After  the  rapid  succession  of 
Yuriy  V.  Andropov  and  Konstantin  U.  Chernenko,  transitional 
figures  with  deep  roots  in  Brezhnevite  tradition,  the  energetic 
Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  made  significant  changes  in  the  econ- 
omy and  the  party  leadership.  His  policy  of  glasnost  (see  Glos- 
sary) freed  public  access  to  information  after  decades  of 
government  repression.  But  Gorbachev  failed  to  address  the 
fundamental  flaws  of  the  Soviet  system;  by  1991,  when  a  plot  by 
government  insiders  revealed  the  weakness  of  Gorbachev's 
political  position,  the  end  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  in  sight. 

Revolutions  and  Civil  War 

The  chaos  and  hardship  that  resulted  from  Russia's  entry 
into  World  War  I  in  1914  were  exacerbated  in  the  years  that  fol- 
lowed. Russians  saw  the  fall  of  the  Romanov  Dynasty,  which  had 
ruled  for  more  than  300  years,  followed  by  a  long  struggle  for 
power  between  the  Bolsheviks  and  a  series  of  disparate  armies, 
known  collectively  as  the  Whites,  supported  by  Russia's  erst- 
while wartime  allies.  The  combination  of  military  occupation 
and  economic  disorder  bled  the  country  for  three  years  until 
the  Bolsheviks  triumphed  and  began  to  establish  a  new  order. 

The  February  Revolution 

By  early  1917,  the  existing  order  in  Russia  was  verging  on 
collapse.  The  country's  involvement  in  World  War  I  had 
already  cost  millions  of  lives  and  severely  disrupted  Russia's 
already  struggling  economy.  In  an  effort  to  reverse  the  worsen- 
ing military  situation,  Nicholas  II  took  personal  command  of 


57 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russian  forces  at  the  front,  leaving  the  conduct  of  government 
in  Petrograd  (St.  Petersburg  before  1914;  Leningrad  after 
1924;  St.  Petersburg  after  1991)  to  his  unpopular  wife  and  a 
series  of  incompetent  ministers.  As  a  consequence  of  these 
conditions,  the  morale  of  the  people  rapidly  deteriorated. 

The  spark  to  the  events  that  ended  tsarist  rule  was  ignited  on 
the  streets  of  Petrograd  in  February  1917  (according  to  the 
Julian  calendar  then  still  in  use  in  Russia;  according  to  the 
modern  Gregorian  calendar,  which  was  adopted  in  February 
1918,  these  events  occurred  in  March).  Driven  by  shortages  of 
food  and  fuel,  crowds  of  hungry  citizens  and  striking  workers 
began  spontaneous  rioting  and  demonstrations.  Local  reserve 
troops,  called  in  to  suppress  the  riots,  refused  to  fire  on  the 
crowds,  and  some  soldiers  joined  the  workers  and  other  rioters. 
A  few  days  later,  with  tsarist  authority  in  Petrograd  disintegrat- 
ing, two  distinct  groups  emerged,  each  claiming  to  represent 
the  Russian  people.  One  was  the  Executive  Committee,  which 
the  Duma  (see  Glossary),  the  lower  house  of  the  Russian  parlia- 
ment, had  established  in  defiance  of  the  tsar's  orders.  The 
other  body  was  the  Petrograd  Soviet  of  Workers'  and  Soldiers' 
Deputies. 

With  the  consent  of  the  Petrograd  Soviet,  the  Executive 
Committee  of  the  Duma  organized  the  Provisional  Govern- 
ment on  March  15.  The  government  was  a  cabinet  of  ministers 
chaired  by  aristocrat  and  social  reformer  Georgiy  L'vov.  A  legis- 
lature, the  Constituent  Assembly,  also  was  to  be  created,  but 
election  of  the  first  such  body  was  postponed  until  the  fall  of 
1917.  Delegates  of  the  new  government  met  Nicholas  that 
evening  at  Pskov,  where  rebellious  railroad  workers  had 
stopped  the  imperial  train  as  the  tsar  attempted  to  return  to 
the  capital.  Advised  by  his  generals  that  he  lacked  the  support 
of  the  country,  Nicholas  informed  the  delegates  that  he  was 
abdicating  in  favor  of  his  brother,  Grand  Duke  Michael.  When 
Michael  in  turn  refused  the  throne,  imperial  rule  in  Russia 
came  to  an  end. 

The  Period  of  Dual  Power 

The  collapse  of  the  monarchy  left  two  rival  political  institu- 
tions— the  Provisional  Government  and  the  Petrograd  Soviet — 
to  share  administrative  authority  over  the  country.  The  Petro- 
grad Soviet,  drawing  its  membership  from  socialist  deputies 
elected  in  factories  and  regiments,  coordinated  the  activities  of 
other  Soviets  that  sprang  up  across  Russia  at  this  time.  The 


58 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


Petrograd  Soviet  was  dominated  by  moderate  socialists  of  the 
Socialist  Revolutionary  Party  and  by  the  Menshevik  (see  Glos- 
sary) faction  of  the  Russian  Social  Democratic  Labor  Party.  The 
Bolshevik  (see  Glossary)  faction  of  the  latter  party  provided  the 
opposition.  Although  it  represented  the  interests  of  Russia's 
working  class,  the  Petrograd  Soviet  at  first  did  not  seek  to 
undermine  the  Provisional  Government's  authority  directly. 
Nevertheless,  the  Petrograd  Soviet's  first  official  order,  which 
came  to  be  known  as  Order  Number  One,  instructed  soldiers 
and  sailors  to  obey  their  officers  and  the  government  only  if 
their  orders  did  not  contradict  the  decrees  of  the  Petrograd 
Soviet — a  measure  formulated  to  prevent  continuation  of  Rus- 
sia's war  effort  by  crippling  the  Provisional  Government's  con- 
trol of  the  military. 

The  Provisional  Government,  in  contrast  to  the  socialist 
Petrograd  Soviet,  chiefly  represented  the  propertied  classes. 
Headed  by  ministers  of  a  moderate  or  liberal  bent,  the  new 
government  pledged  to  convene  a  constituent  assembly  that 
would  usher  in  a  new  era  of  bourgeois  democracy  modeled  on 
European  constitutionalism.  In  the  meantime,  the  government 
granted  unprecedented  rights — full  freedom  of  speech,  press, 
and  religion,  as  well  as  legal  equality — to  all  citizens.  The  gov- 
ernment did  not  take  up  the  matter  of  land  redistribution, 
however,  leaving  that  issue  for  the  Constituent  Assembly.  Even 
more  damaging,  the  ministers  favored  keeping  Russia's  military 
commitments  to  its  allies,  a  position  that  became  increasingly 
unpopular  as  the  war  dragged  on.  The  government  suffered  its 
first  crisis  in  the  "April  Days,"  when  demonstrations  against  the 
government's  war  aims  forced  two  ministers  to  resign,  an  event 
that  led  to  the  appointment  of  Aleksandr  Kerenskiy — the  only 
socialist  among  the  government's  ministers — as  war  minister. 
Quickly  assuming  de  facto  leadership  of  the  government, 
Kerenskiy  ordered  the  army  to  launch  a  major  offensive  in 
June.  After  early  successes,  that  offensive  turned  into  a 
full-scale  retreat  in  July. 

While  the  Provisional  Government  grappled  with  foreign 
foes,  the  Bolsheviks,  who  were  opposed  to  bourgeois  democ- 
racy, gained  new  strength.  Lenin,  the  Bolshevik  leader, 
returned  to  Petrograd  in  April  1917  from  his  wartime  resi- 
dence in  Switzerland.  Although  he  had  been  born  into  a  noble 
family,  from  his  youth  Lenin  espoused  the  cause  of  the  com- 
mon workers.  A  committed  revolutionary  and  pragmatic  Marx- 
ist thinker,  he  astounded  the  Bolsheviks  in  Petrograd  with  his 


59 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

April  Theses,  in  which  he  boldly  called  for  the  overthrow  of  the 
Provisional  Government,  the  transfer  of  "all  power  to  the  Sovi- 
ets," and  the  expropriation  of  factories  by  workers  and  of  land 
belonging  to  the  church,  the  nobility,  and  the  gentry  by  peas- 
ants. Lenin's  dynamic  presence  quickly  won  the  other  Bolshe- 
vik leaders  to  his  position,  and  the  radicalized  orientation  of 
the  Bolshevik  faction  attracted  new  members. 

Inspired  by  Lenin's  slogans,  crowds  of  workers,  soldiers,  and 
sailors  took  to  the  streets  of  Petrograd  in  July  to  wrest  power 
from  the  Provisional  Government.  But  the  spontaneity  of  the 
'July  Days"  caught  the  Bolshevik  leaders  by  surprise,  and  the 
Petrograd  Soviet,  controlled  by  moderate  Mensheviks,  refused 
to  take  power  or  to  enforce  Bolshevik  demands.  After  the  upris- 
ing had  died  down,  the  Provisional  Government  outlawed  the 
Bolsheviks  and  jailed  Leon  Trotsky,  leader  of  a  leftist  Menshe- 
vik  faction.  Lenin  fled  to  Finland. 

In  the  aftermath  of  the  'July  Days,"  conservatives  sought  to 
reassert  order  in  society.  The  army's  commander  in  chief, 
General  Lavr  Kornilov,  who  protested  the  influence  of  the  Sovi- 
ets on  both  the  army  and  the  government,  appeared  as  a  coun- 
terrevolutionary threat  to  Kerenskiy,  now  prime  minister. 
Kerenskiy  dismissed  Kornilov  from  his  command,  but  Kornilov, 
disobeying  the  order,  launched  an  extemporaneous  revolt  on 
September  10  (August  28).  To  defend  the  capital,  Kerenskiy 
sought  help  from  all  quarters  and  relaxed  his  ban  on  Bolshevik 
activities.  Railroad  workers  sympathetic  to  the  Bolsheviks 
halted  Kornilov's  troop  trains,  and  Kornilov  soon  surrendered, 
ending  the  only  serious  challenge  to  the  Provisional  Govern- 
ment from  the  right. 

The  Bolshevik  Revolution 

Although  the  Provisional  Government  survived  the  Kornilov 
revolt,  popular  support  for  the  government  faded  rapidly  as 
the  national  mood  swung  to  the  left  in  the  fall  of  1917.  Workers 
took  control  of  their  factories  through  elected  committees; 
peasants  expropriated  lands  belonging  to  the  state,  church, 
nobility,  and  gentry;  and  armies  melted  away  as  peasant  sol- 
diers deserted  to  take  part  in  the  land  seizures.  The  Bolsheviks, 
skillfully  exploiting  these  popular  trends  in  their  propaganda, 
achieved  domination  of  the  Petrograd  and  Moscow  Soviets  by 
September.  Trotsky,  freed  from  prison  after  the  Kornilov  revolt, 
was  recruited  as  a  Bolshevik  and  named  chairman  of  the  Petro- 
grad Soviet. 


60 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


Realizing  that  the  time  was  ripe  to  seize  power  by  force, 
Lenin  returned  to  Petrograd  in  October  and  convinced  a 
majority  of  the  Bolshevik  Central  Committee,  which  had  hoped 
to  take  power  legally,  to  accept  armed  uprising  in  principle. 
Trotsky  won  the  Petrograd  garrison  over  to  the  soviet,  depriv- 
ing the  Provisional  Government  of  its  main  military  support  in 
Petrograd. 

The  actual  insurrection — the  Bolshevik  Revolution — began 
on  November  6,  when  Kerenskiy  ordered  the  Bolshevik  press 
closed.  Interpreting  this  action  as  a  counterrevolutionary 
move,  the  Bolsheviks  called  on  their  supporters  to  defend  the 
Petrograd  Soviet.  By  evening,  the  Bolsheviks  had  taken  control 
of  utilities  and  most  government  buildings  in  Petrograd,  thus 
enabling  Lenin  to  proclaim  the  downfall  of  the  Provisional 
Government  on  the  morning  of  the  next  day,  November  7.  The 
Bolsheviks  captured  the  Provisional  Government's  cabinet  at  its 
Winter  Palace  headquarters  that  night  with  hardly  a  shot  fired 
in  the  government's  defense.  Kerenskiy  left  Petrograd  to  orga- 
nize resistance,  but  his  countercoup  failed  and  he  fled  Russia. 
Bolshevik  uprisings  soon  took  place  elsewhere;  Moscow  was 
under  Bolshevik  control  within  three  weeks.  The  Second  Con- 
gress of  Soviets  met  in  Petrograd  to  ratify  the  Bolshevik  take- 
over after  moderate  deputies  (mainly  Mensheviks  and  right- 
wing  members  of  the  Socialist  Revolutionary  Party)  quit  the 
session.  The  remaining  Bolsheviks  and  left-wing  Socialist  Revo- 
lutionaries declared  the  Soviets  the  governing  bodies  of  Russia 
and  named  the  Council  of  People's  Commissars  (Sovet  narod- 
nykh  kommissarov — Sovnarkom)  to  serve  as  the  cabinet.  Lenin 
became  chairman  of  this  council.  Trotsky  took  the  post  of  com- 
missar of  foreign  affairs;  Stalin,  a  Georgian,  became  commissar 
of  nationalities.  Thus,  by  acting  decisively  while  their  oppo- 
nents vacillated,  the  Bolsheviks  succeeded  in  effecting  their 
coup  d'etat. 

On  coming  to  power,  the  Bolsheviks  issued  a  series  of  revolu- 
tionary decrees  ratifying  peasants'  seizures  of  land  and  workers' 
control  of  industries,  abolished  laws  sanctioning  class  privi- 
leges, nationalized  the  banks,  and  set  up  revolutionary  tribu- 
nals in  place  of  the  courts.  At  the  same  time,  the 
revolutionaries  now  constituting  the  regime  worked  to  secure 
power  inside  and  outside  the  government.  Deeming  Western 
forms  of  parliamentary  democracy  irrelevant,  Lenin  argued  for 
a  "dictatorship  of  the  proletariat"  based  on  single-party  Bolshe- 
vik rule,  although  for  a  time  left-wing  Socialist  Revolutionaries 


61 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

also  participated  in  the  Sovnarkom.  The  new  government  cre- 
ated a  secret  police  agency,  the  VChK  (commonly  known  as  the 
Cheka),  to  persecute  enemies  of  the  state  (including  bourgeois 
liberals  and  moderate  socialists) .  Having  convened  the  Constit- 
uent Assembly,  which  finally  had  been  elected  in  November 
with  the  Bolsheviks  winning  only  a  quarter  of  the  seats,  the 
Soviet  government  dissolved  the  assembly  in  January  after  a 
one-day  session,  ending  a  short-lived  experiment  in  parliamen- 
tary democracy 

In  foreign  affairs,  the  Soviet  government,  seeking  to  disen- 
gage Russia  from  World  War  I,  called  on  the  belligerent  powers 
for  an  armistice  and  peace  without  annexations.  The  Allied 
Powers  rejected  this  appeal,  but  Germany  and  its  allies  agreed 
to  a  cease-fire.  Negotiations  began  in  December  1917.  After 
dictating  harsh  terms  that  the  Soviet  government  would  not 
accept,  however,  Germany  resumed  its  offensive  in  February 
1918,  meeting  scant  resistance  from  disintegrating  Russian 
armies.  Lenin,  after  bitter  debate  with  leading  Bolsheviks  who 
favored  prolonging  the  war  in  hopes  of  precipitating  class  war- 
fare in  Germany,  persuaded  a  slim  majority  of  the  Bolshevik 
Central  Committee  that  peace  must  be  made  at  any  cost.  On 
March  3,  Soviet  government  officials  signed  the  Treaty  of 
Brest-Li  to  vsk,  relinquishing  Poland,  the  Baltic  lands,  Finland, 
and  Ukraine  to  German  control  and  giving  up  a  portion  of  the 
Caucasus  region  to  Turkey.  With  the  new  border  dangerously 
close  to  Petrograd,  the  government  was  soon  transferred  to 
Moscow.  An  enormous  part  of  the  population  and  resources  of 
the  Russian  Empire  was  lost  by  this  treaty,  but  Lenin  under- 
stood that  no  other  alternative  could  ensure  the  survival  of  the 
fledgling  Soviet  state. 

Civil  War  and  War  Communism 

Soon  after  buying  peace  with  Germany,  the  Soviet  state 
found  itself  under  attack  from  other  quarters.  By  the  spring  of 
1918,  elements  dissatisfied  with  the  radical  policies  of  the  com- 
munists (as  the  Bolsheviks  started  calling  themselves)  estab- 
lished centers  of  resistance  in  southern  and  Siberian  Russia. 
Beginning  in  April  1918,  anticommunist  forces,  called  the 
Whites  and  often  led  by  former  officers  of  the  tsarist  army, 
began  to  clash  with  the  Red  Army,  which  Trotsky,  named  com- 
missar of  war  in  the  Soviet  government,  organized  to  defend 
the  new  state.  A  civil  war  to  determine  the  future  of  Russia  had 
begun. 


62 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


The  White  armies  enjoyed  varying  degrees  of  support  from 
the  Allied  Powers.  Desiring  to  defeat  Germany  in  any  way  possi- 
ble, Britain,  France,  and  the  United  States  landed  troops  in 
Russia  and  provided  logistical  support  to  the  Whites,  whom  the 
Allies  trusted  would  resume  Russia's  struggle  against  Germany 
after  overthrowing  the  communist  regime.  (In  March  1918,  the 
Russian  Social  Democratic  Labor  Party  officially  was  renamed 
the  Russian  Communist  Party  [Bolshevik].)  After  the  Allies 
defeated  Germany  in  November  1918,  they  opted  to  continue 
their  intervention  in  the  Russian  Civil  War  against  the  commu- 
nists, in  the  interests  of  averting  what  they  feared  might 
become  a  world  socialist  revolution. 

During  the  Civil  War,  the  Soviet  regime  also  had  to  deal  with 
struggles  for  independence  in  regions  that  it  had  given  up 
under  the  Treaty  of  Brest-Litovsk  (which  the  regime  immedi- 
ately repudiated  after  Germany's  defeat  by  the  Allies  in  Novem- 
ber 1918).  By  force  of  arms,  the  communists  established  Soviet 
republics  in  Belorussia  (January  1919),  Ukraine  (March  1919), 
Azerbaijan  (April  1920),  Armenia  (November  1920),  and 
Georgia  (March  1921),  but  they  were  unable  to  take  back  the 
Baltic  region,  where  the  independent  states  of  Estonia,  Latvia, 
and  Lithuania  had  been  founded  shortly  after  the  Bolshevik 
Revolution.  In  December  1917,  the  Soviet  government  recog- 
nized the  independence  of  Finland  as  a  gesture  of  support  to 
the  Finnish  Reds.  However,  that  strategy  failed  when  Finland 
became  a  parliamentary  republic  in  1918.  Poland,  reborn  after 
World  War  I,  fought  a  successful  war  with  Soviet  Russia  from 
April  1920  to  March  1921  over  the  location  of  the  frontier 
between  the  two  states. 

During  its  struggle  for  survival,  the  Soviet  state  relied  heavily 
on  the  prospect  that  revolution  would  spread  to  other  Euro- 
pean industrialized  countries.  To  coordinate  the  socialist  move- 
ment under  Soviet  auspices,  Lenin  founded  the  Communist 
International  (Comintern)  in  March  1919.  Although  no  suc- 
cessful socialist  revolutions  occurred  elsewhere  immediately 
after  the  Bolshevik  Revolution,  the  Comintern  provided  the 
communist  leadership  with  the  means  for  later  control  of  for- 
eign communist  parties. 

By  the  end  of  1920,  the  communists  had  clearly  triumphed 
in  the  Civil  War.  Although  in  1919  Soviet  Russia  had  shrunk  to 
the  size  of  sixteenth-century  Muscovy,  the  Red  Army  had  the 
advantage  of  defending  the  heartland  with  Moscow  at  its  center 
(see  fig.  4).  The  White  armies,  divided  geographically  and  with-

out  a  clearly  defined  cause,  went  down  to  defeat  one  by  one. 
Hopes  of  restoring  the  monarchy  ended  effectively  when  com- 
munists executed  the  imperial  family  in  July  1918.  The  Allied 
governments,  lacking  support  for  intervention  from  their 
nations'  war-weary  citizenry,  withdrew  most  of  their  forces  by 
1920.  The  last  foreign  troops  departed  Siberia  in  1922,  leaving 
the  Soviet  state  unchallenged  from  abroad. 

During  the  Civil  War,  the  communist  regime  took  increas- 
ingly repressive  measures  against  its  domestic  opponents.  The 
constitution  of  1918  deprived  members  of  the  former  "exploit- 
ing classes" — nobles,  priests,  and  capitalists — of  civil  rights. 
Left-wing  Socialist  Revolutionaries,  formerly  partners  of  the 
Bolsheviks,  became  targets  for  persecution  during  what  came 
to  be  known  as  the  Red  Terror,  which  followed  an  attempt  on 
Lenin's  life  in  August  1918  and  lasted  into  1920.  In  those  des- 
perate times,  both  Reds  and  Whites  murdered  and  executed

without  trial  large  numbers  of  suspected  enemies.  The  party 
also  took  measures  to  ensure  greater  discipline  among  its  mem- 
bers by  tightening  its  organization  and  creating  specialized 
administrative  organs. 

In  the  economic  life  of  the  country,  too,  the  communist 
regime  sought  to  exert  control  through  a  series  of  drastic  mea- 
sures that  came  to  be  known  as  war  communism.  To  coordinate 
what  remained  of  Russia's  economic  resources  after  years  of 
war,  in  1918  the  government  nationalized  industry  and  subor- 
dinated it  to  central  administrations  in  Moscow.  Rejecting 
workers'  control  of  factories  as  inefficient,  the  regime  brought 
in  expert  managers  to  run  the  factories  and  organized  and 
directed  the  factory  workers  as  in  a  military  mobilization.  To 
feed  the  urban  population,  the  Soviet  government  requisi- 
tioned quantities  of  grain  from  the  peasantry. 

The  results  of  war  communism  were  unsatisfactory.  Indus- 
trial production  continued  to  fall.  Workers  received  wages  in 
kind  because  inflation  had  made  the  ruble  practically  worth- 
less. In  the  countryside,  peasants  rebelled  against  payments  in 
valueless  currency  by  curtailing  or  consuming  their  agricultural 
production.  In  late  1920,  strikes  broke  out  in  the  industrial 
centers,  and  peasant  uprisings  sprang  up  across  the  land  as 
famine  ravaged  the  countryside.  To  the  Soviet  government, 
however,  the  most  disquieting  manifestation  of  dissatisfaction 
with  war  communism  was  the  rebellion  in  March  1921  of  sailors 
at  the  naval  base  at  Kronshtadt  (near  Petrograd),  which  had 
earlier  won  renown  as  a  bastion  of  the  Bolshevik  Revolution. 
Although  Trotsky  and  the  Red  Army  succeeded  in  putting 
down  the  mutiny,  it  signaled  to  the  party  leadership  that  war 
communism  had  to  end.  The  harsh  economic  policies  of  the 
Civil  War  period,  however,  would  have  a  profound  influence  on 
the  future  development  of  the  country. 

The  Era  of  the  New  Economic  Policy 

The  period  of  war  communism  was  followed  in  the  1920s  by 
a  partial  retreat  from  Bolshevik  principles.  The  New  Economic 
Policy  (Novaya  ekonomicheskaya  politika — NEP;  see  Glossary) 
permitted  certain  types  of  private  economic  activity,  so  that  the 
country  might  recover  from  the  ravages  of  the  Civil  War.  The 
interval  was  cut  short,  however,  by  the  death  of  Lenin  and  the 
sharply  different  approach  to  governance  of  his  successor, 
Joseph  Stalin.

Lenin's  Leadership 

With  the  Kronshtadt  base  rebelling  against  war  communism, 
the  Tenth  Party  Congress  of  the  Russian  Communist  Party 
(Bolshevik)  met  in  March  1921  to  hear  Lenin  argue  for  a  new 
course  in  Soviet  policy.  Lenin  realized  that  the  radical 
approach  to  communism  (see  Glossary)  was  unsuited  to  exist- 
ing conditions  and  jeopardized  the  survival  of  his  regime.  Now 
the  Soviet  leader  proposed  a  tactical  retreat,  convincing  the 
congress  to  adopt  a  temporary  compromise  with  capitalism 
under  the  NEP  program.  Under  the  NEP,  market  forces  and 
the  monetary  system  regained  their  importance.  The  state 
scrapped  its  policy  of  grain  requisitioning  in  favor  of  taxation, 
permitting  peasants  to  dispose  of  their  produce  as  they 
pleased.  The  NEP  also  denationalized  service  enterprises  and 
much  small-scale  industry,  leaving  the  "commanding  heights" 
of  the  economy — large-scale  industry,  transportation,  and  for- 
eign trade — under  state  control.  Under  the  mixed  economy 
called  for  under  the  NEP,  agriculture  and  industry  staged 
recoveries,  with  most  branches  of  the  economy  attaining  pre- 
war levels  of  production  by  the  late  1920s.  In  general,  standards 
of  living  improved  during  this  time,  and  the  "NEP  man" — the 
independent  private  trader — became  a  symbol  of  the  era. 

About  the  time  that  the  party  sanctioned  partial  decentrali- 
zation of  the  economy,  it  also  approved  a  quasi-federal  struc- 
ture for  the  state.  During  the  Civil  War,  the  non-Russian  Soviet 
republics  on  the  periphery  of  Russia  were  theoretically  inde- 
pendent, but  in  fact  they  were  controlled  by  the  central  govern- 
ment through  the  party  and  the  Red  Army.  Some  communists 
favored  a  centralized  Soviet  state,  while  nationalists  wanted 
autonomy  for  the  borderlands.  A  compromise  between  the  two 
positions  was  reached  in  December  1922  with  the  formation  of 
the  USSR.  The  constituent  republics  of  this  "Soviet  Union" 
(the  Russian,  Belorussian,  Ukrainian,  and  Transcaucasian 
republics — the  last  combining  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Geor- 
gia) exercised  a  degree  of  cultural  and  linguistic  autonomy, 
while  the  communist,  predominantly  Russian,  leadership  in 
Moscow  retained  political  authority  over  the  entire  country. 
The  giant  Central  Asian  territory  was  given  republic  status 
piecemeal,  beginning  with  the  inclusion  of  the  Turkmen  and 
Uzbek  republics  in  1924  and  concluding  with  the  separation  of 
Kazakstan  and  Kyrgyzstan  in  1936.  By  that  year,  the  Soviet 
Union  included  eleven  republics,  all  with  government  struc-

tures  and  ruling  communist  parties  identical  to  the  one  in  the 
Russian  Republic. 

The  party  consolidated  its  authority  throughout  the  country, 
becoming  a  monolithic  presence  in  state  and  society.  Potential 
rivals  outside  the  party  including  prominent  members  of  the 
abolished  Menshevik  faction  and  the  Socialist  Revolutionary 
Party,  were  exiled.  Within  the  party,  Lenin  denounced  the  for- 
mation of  factions,  particularly  by  radical-left  party  members. 
Central  party  organs  subordinated  local  Soviets  to  their  author- 
ity. Party  members  perceived  as  less  committed  periodically 
were  purged  from  the  rosters.  The  Politburo  (Political 
Bureau),  which  became  the  elite  policy-making  agency  of  the 
nation,  created  the  new  post  of  general  secretary  for  the  super- 
vision of  personnel  matters  and  assigned  Stalin  to  this  office  in 
April  1922.  A  minor  member  of  the  party's  Central  Committee 
at  the  time  of  the  Bolshevik  Revolution,  Stalin  was  thought  to 
be  a  rather  lackluster  personality  and  therefore  well  suited  to 
the  routine  work  required  of  the  general  secretary. 

From  the  time  of  the  Bolshevik  Revolution  and  into  the  early 
NEP  years,  the  actual  leader  of  the  Soviet  state  was  Lenin. 
Although  a  collective  of  prominent  communists  nominally 
guided  the  party  and  the  Soviet  Union,  Lenin  commanded 
such  prestige  and  authority  that  even  such  brilliant  theoreti- 
cians as  Trotsky  and  Nikolay  Bukharin  generally  yielded  to  his 
will.  But  when  Lenin  became  temporarily  incapacitated  after  a 
stroke  in  May  1922,  the  unity  of  the  Politburo  fractured,  and  a 
troika  (triumvirate)  formed  by  Stalin,  Lev  Kamenev,  and  Gri- 
goriy  Zinov'yev  assumed  leadership  in  opposition  to  Trotsky. 
Lenin  recovered  late  in  1922  and  found  fault  with  the  troika, 
and  particularly  with  Stalin.  In  Lenin's  view,  Stalin  had  used 
coercion  to  force  non-Russian  republics  to  join  the  Soviet 
Union,  he  was  uncouth,  and  he  was  accumulating  too  much 
power  through  his  office  of  general  secretary.  Although  Lenin 
recommended  that  Stalin  be  removed  from  that  position,  the 
Politburo  decided  not  to  take  action,  and  Stalin  still  was  in 
office  when  Lenin  died  in  January  1924. 

As  important  as  Lenin's  activities  were  to  the  establishment 
of  the  Soviet  Union,  his  legacy  to  the  Soviet  future  was  perhaps 
even  more  significant.  By  willingly  changing  his  policies  to  suit 
new  situations,  Lenin  had  developed  a  pragmatic  interpreta- 
tion of  Marxism  (later  called  Marxism-Leninism — see  Glos- 
sary) that  implied  that  the  party  should  follow  any  course  that 
would  ultimately  lead  to  communism.  His  party,  while  still  per- 


67 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

mitting  intraorganizational  debate,  insisted  that  its  members 
adhere  to  the  organization's  decisions  once  they  were  adopted, 
in  accordance  with  the  principle  of  democratic  centralism. 
Finally,  because  the  party  embodied  the  dictatorship  of  the 
proletariat,  organized  opposition  could  not  be  tolerated,  and 
adversaries  would  be  prosecuted.  Thus,  although  the  Soviet 
regime  was  not  totalitarian  when  he  died,  Lenin  had  nonethe- 
less laid  the  foundation  upon  which  such  a  tyranny  would  later 
arise. 

Stalin's  Rise  to  Power 

After  Lenin's  death,  two  conflicting  schools  of  thought  about 
the  future  of  the  Soviet  Union  arose  in  party  debates.  Left-wing 
communists  believed  that  world  revolution  was  essential  to  the 
survival  of  socialism  in  the  economically  backward  Soviet 
Union.  Trotsky,  one  of  the  primary  proponents  of  this  position, 
called  for  Soviet  support  of  a  permanent  world  revolutionary 
movement.  As  for  domestic  policy,  the  left  wing  advocated  the 
rapid  development  of  the  economy  and  the  creation  of  a  social- 
ist society.  In  contrast  to  these  militant  communists,  the  right 
wing  of  the  party,  recognizing  that  world  revolution  was 
unlikely  in  the  immediate  future,  favored  the  gradual  develop- 
ment of  the  Soviet  Union  through  continuation  of  pragmatic 
programs  like  the  NEP.  Yet  even  Bukharin,  one  of  the  major 
right-wing  theoreticians,  believed  that  socialism  could  not  tri- 
umph in  the  Soviet  Union  without  assistance  from  more  eco- 
nomically advanced  socialist  countries. 

Against  this  backdrop  of  contrasting  perceptions  of  the 
Soviet  future,  the  leading  figures  of  the  Ail-Union  Communist 
Party  (Bolshevik) — the  new  name  of  the  Russian  Communist 
Party  (Bolshevik)  as  of  December  1925 — competed  for  influ- 
ence. The  Kamenev-Zinov'yev-Stalin  troika,  although  it  sup- 
ported the  militant  international  program,  successfully 
maneuvered  against  Trotsky  and  engineered  his  removal  as 
commissar  of  war  in  1925.  In  the  meantime,  Stalin  gradually 
consolidated  his  power  base  and,  when  he  had  sufficient 
strength,  broke  with  Kamenev  and  Zinov'yev.  Belatedly  recog- 
nizing Stalin's  political  power,  Kamenev  and  Zinov'yev  made 
amends  with  Trotsky  in  order  to  join  against  their  former  part- 
ner. But  Stalin  countered  their  attacks  on  his  position  with  his 
well-timed  formulation  of  the  theory  of  "socialism  in  one  coun- 
try." This  doctrine,  calling  for  construction  of  a  socialist  society 
in  the  Soviet  Union  regardless  of  the  international  situation, 


68 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


distanced  Stalin  from  the  left  and  won  support  from  Bukharin 
and  the  party's  right  wing.  With  this  support,  Stalin  ousted  the 
leaders  of  the  "Left  Opposition"  from  their  positions  in  1926 
and  1927  and  forced  Trotsky  into  exile  in  1928.  As  the  NEP  era 
ended,  open  debate  within  the  party  became  increasingly  lim- 
ited as  Stalin  gradually  eliminated  his  opponents. 

Foreign  Policy,  1921-28 

In  the  1920s,  as  the  new  Soviet  state  temporarily  retreated 
from  the  revolutionary  path  to  socialism,  the  party  also 
adopted  a  less  ideological  approach  in  its  relations  with  the  rest 
of  the  world.  Lenin,  ever  the  practical  leader,  having  become 
convinced  that  socialist  revolution  would  not  break  out  in 
other  countries  in  the  near  future,  realized  that  his  govern- 
ment required  normal  relations  with  the  Western  world  for  it 
to  survive.  Not  only  were  good  relations  important  to  national 
security,  but  the  economy  also  required  trade  with  the  indus- 
trial countries.  Blocking  Soviet  attainment  of  these  objectives 
were  lingering  suspicions  about  communism  on  the  part  of  the 
Western  powers  and  concern  over  foreign  debts  incurred  by 
the  tsarist  government,  which  the  Soviet  government  had  uni- 
laterally repudiated.  In  April  1922,  the  Soviet  commissar  of  for- 
eign affairs,  Georgiy  Chicherin,  circumvented  these  difficulties 
by  achieving  an  understanding  with  Germany,  the  other  pariah 
state  of  Europe,  in  the  Treaty  of  Rapallo.  Under  the  treaty,  Ger- 
many and  Russia  agreed  on  mutual  recognition,  cancellation  of 
debt  claims,  normalization  of  trade  relations,  and  secret  coop- 
eration in  military  development.  Soon  after  concluding  the 
treaty,  the  Soviet  Union  obtained  diplomatic  recognition  from 
other  major  powers,  beginning  with  Britain  in  February  1924. 
Although  the  United  States  withheld  recognition  until  1933, 
private  American  firms  began  to  extend  technological  assis- 
tance and  to  develop  commercial  links  in  the  1920s. 

Toward  the  non-Western  world,  the  Soviet  leadership  limited 
its  revolutionary  activity  to  promoting  opposition  among  the 
indigenous  populations  against  "imperialist  exploitation."  The 
Soviet  Union  did  pursue  an  active  policy  in  China,  aiding  the 
Guomindang  (Nationalist  Party),  a  non-Marxist  organization 
committed  to  reform  and  national  sovereignty.  After  the  tri- 
umph of  the  Guomindang  in  1927,  a  debate  developed  among 
Soviet  leaders  concerning  the  future  status  of  relations  with 
China.  Stalin  wanted  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  to  join  the 
Guomindang  and  infiltrate  the  government  from  within,  while 


69 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Trotsky  proposed  an  armed  communist  uprising  and  forcible 
imposition  of  socialism.  Although  Stalin's  plan  was  finally 
accepted,  it  came  to  naught  when  in  192V  the  Guomindang 
leader  Chiang  Kai-shek  ordered  the  Chinese  communists  mas- 
sacred and  Soviet  advisers  expelled. 

Society  and  Culture  in  the  1920s 

In  many  respects,  the  NEP  period  was  a  time  of  relative  free- 
dom and  experimentation  in  the  social  and  cultural  life  of  the 
Soviet  Union.  The  government  tolerated  a  variety  of  trends  in 
these  fields,  provided  they  were  not  overtly  hostile  to  the 
regime.  In  art  and  literature,  numerous  schools,  some  tradi- 
tional and  others  radically  experimental,  proliferated.  Commu- 
nist writers  Maksim  Gor'kiy  and  Vladimir  Mayakovskiy  were 
active  during  this  time,  but  other  authors,  many  of  whose  works 
were  later  repressed,  published  work  lacking  socialist  political 
content  (see  Literature  and  the  Arts,  ch.  4).  Filmmaking,  as  a 
means  of  influencing  a  largely  illiterate  society,  received 
encouragement  from  the  state;  much  of  legendary  cinematog- 
rapher  Sergey  Eisenstein's  best  work  dates  from  this  period. 

Under  Commissar  Anatoliy  Lunacharskiy,  education  entered 
a  phase  of  experimentation  based  on  progressive  theories  of 
learning.  At  the  same  time,  the  state  expanded  the  primary 
and  secondary  school  systems  and  introduced  night  schools  for 
working  adults.  The  quality  of  higher  education  suffered,  how- 
ever, because  admissions  policies  gave  preference  to  entrants 
from  the  proletarian  class  over  those  with  bourgeois  back- 
grounds, regardless  of  qualifications. 

In  family  life,  attitudes  generally  became  more  permissive. 
The  state  legalized  abortion,  and  it  made  divorce  progressively 
easier  to  obtain.  In  general,  traditional  attitudes  toward  such 
institutions  as  marriage  were  subtly  undermined  by  the  party's 
promotion  of  revolutionary  ideals. 

Transformation  and  Terror 

The  gradual  accession  of  Stalin  to  power  in  the  1920s  even- 
tually brought  an  end  to  the  liberalization  of  society  and  the 
economy,  leading  instead  to  a  period  of  unprecedented  gov- 
ernment control,  mobilization,  and  terrorization  of  society  in 
Russia  and  the  other  Soviet  republics.  In  the  1930s,  agriculture 
and  industry  underwent  brutal  forced  centralization,  and  Rus- 
sian cultural  activity  was  highly  restricted.  Purges  eliminated 


70 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


thousands  of  individuals  deemed  dangerous  to  the  Soviet  state 
by  Stalin's  operatives. 

Industrialization  and  Collectivization 

At  the  end  of  the  1920s,  a  dramatic  new  phase  in  economic 
development  began  when  Stalin  decided  to  carry  out  a  pro- 
gram of  intensive  socialist  construction.  To  some  extent,  Stalin 
pressed  economic  development  at  this  point  as  a  political 
maneuver  to  eliminate  rivals  within  the  party.  Because 
Bukharin  and  some  other  party  members  would  not  give  up 
the  gradualistic  NEP  in  favor  of  radical  development,  Stalin 
branded  them  "right-wing  deviationists"  and  during  1929  and 
1930  used  the  party  organization  to  remove  them  from  influen- 
tial positions.  Yet  Stalin's  break  with  the  NEP  also  revealed  that 
his  doctrine  of  building  "socialism  in  one  country"  paralleled 
the  line  that  Trotsky  had  originally  supported  early  in  the 
1920s.  Marxism  supplied  no  basis  for  Stalin's  model  of  a 
planned  economy,  although  the  centralized  economic  controls 
of  the  war  communism  years  seemingly  furnished  a  Leninist 
precedent.  Between  1927  and  1929,  the  State  Planning  Com- 
mittee (Gosudarstvennyy  planovyy  komitet — Gosplan)  worked 
out  the  First  Five-Year  Plan  (see  Glossary)  for  intensive  eco- 
nomic growth;  Stalin  began  to  implement  this  plan — his  "revo- 
lution from  above" — in  1928. 

The  First  Five-Year  Plan  called  for  rapid  industrialization  of 
the  economy,  with  particular  emphasis  on  heavy  industry.  The 
economy  was  centralized:  small-scale  industry  and  services 
were  nationalized,  managers  strove  to  fulfill  Gosplan's  output 
quotas,  and  the  trade  unions  were  converted  into  mechanisms 
for  increasing  worker  productivity.  But  because  Stalin  insisted 
on  unrealistic  production  targets,  serious  problems  soon  arose. 
With  the  greatest  share  of  investment  put  into  heavy  industry, 
widespread  shortages  of  consumer  goods  occurred,  and  infla- 
tion grew. 

To  satisfy  the  state's  need  for  increased  food  supplies,  the 
First  Five-Year  Plan  called  for  the  organization  of  the  peasantry 
into  collective  units  that  the  authorities  could  easily  control. 
This  collectivization  program  entailed  compounding  the  peas- 
ants' lands  and  animals  into  collective  farms  (kolkhozy;  sing., 
kolkhoz — see  Glossary)  and  state  farms  (sovkhozy;  sing.,  sovkhoz — 
see  Glossary)  and  restricting  the  peasants'  movement  from 
these  farms.  The  effect  of  this  restructuring  was  to  reintroduce 
a  kind  of  serfdom  into  the  countryside.  Although  the  program 


71 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

was  designed  to  affect  all  peasants,  Stalin  in  particular  sought 
to  eliminate  the  wealthiest  peasants,  known  as  kulaks.  Gener- 
ally, kulaks  were  only  marginally  better  off  than  other  peasants, 
but  the  party  claimed  that  the  kulaks  had  ensnared  the  rest  of 
the  peasantry  in  capitalistic  relationships.  In  any  event,  collec- 
tivization met  widespread  resistance  not  only  from  the  kulaks 
but  from  poorer  peasants  as  well,  and  a  desperate  struggle  of 
the  peasantry  against  the  authorities  ensued.  Peasants  slaugh- 
tered their  cows  and  pigs  rather  than  turn  them  over  to  the  col- 
lective farms,  with  the  result  that  livestock  resources  remained 
below  the  1929  level  for  years  afterward.  The  state  in  turn  forc- 
ibly collectivized  reluctant  peasants  and  deported  kulaks  and 
active  rebels  to  Siberia.  Within  the  collective  farms,  the  author- 
ities in  many  instances  exacted  such  high  levels  of  procure- 
ment that  starvation  was  widespread. 

By  1932  Stalin  realized  that  both  the  economy  and  society 
were  under  serious  strain.  Although  industry  failed  to  meet  its 
production  targets  and  agriculture  actually  lost  ground  in  com- 
parison with  1928  yields,  Stalin  declared  that  the  First  Five-Year 
Plan  had  successfully  met  its  goals  in  four  years.  He  then  pro- 
ceeded to  set  more  realistic  goals.  Under  the  Second  Five-Year 
Plan  (1933-37),  the  state  devoted  attention  to  consumer 
goods,  and  the  factories  built  under  the  first  plan  helped 
increase  industrial  output  in  general.  The  Third  Five-Year  Plan, 
begun  in  1938,  produced  poorer  results  because  of  a  sudden 
shift  of  emphasis  to  armaments  production  in  response  to  the 
worsening  international  climate.  In  general,  however,  the 
Soviet  economy  had  become  industrialized  by  the  end  of  the 
1930s.  Agriculture,  which  had  been  exploited  to  finance  the 
industrialization  drive,  continued  to  show  poor  returns 
throughout  the  decade. 

The  Purges 

The  complete  subjugation  of  the  party  to  Stalin,  its  leader, 
paralleled  the  subordination  of  industry  and  agriculture  to  the 
state.  Stalin  had  assured  his  preeminent  position  by  squelching 
Bukharin  and  the  "right-wing  deviationists"  in  1929  and  1930. 
To  secure  his  absolute  control  over  the  party,  however,  Stalin 
began  to  purge  leaders  and  rank-and-file  members  whose  loy- 
alty he  doubted. 

Stalin's  purges  began  in  December  1934,  when  Sergey  Kirov, 
a  popular  Leningrad  party  chief  who  advocated  a  moderate 
policy  toward  the  peasants,  was  assassinated.  Although  details 


72 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


remain  murky,  many  Western  historians  believe  that  Stalin 
instigated  the  murder  to  rid  himself  of  a  potential  opponent. 
In  any  event,  in  the  resultant  mass  purge  of  the  local  Leningrad 
party,  thousands  were  deported  to  camps  in  Siberia.  Zinov'yev 
and  Kamenev,  Stalin's  former  political  partners,  received 
prison  sentences  for  their  alleged  role  in  Kirov's  murder.  At  the 
same  time,  the  People's  Commissariat  for  Internal  Affairs  (Nar- 
odnyy  komissariat  vnutrennikh  del — NKVD),  the  secret  police 
agency  that  was  heir  to  the  Cheka  of  the  early  1920s,  stepped 
up  surveillance  through  its  agents  and  informers  and  claimed 
to  uncover  anti-Soviet  conspiracies  among  prominent 
long-term  party  members.  At  three  publicized  show  trials  held 
in  Moscow  between  1936  and  1938,  dozens  of  these  Old  Bol- 
sheviks, including  Zinov'yev,  Kamenev,  and  Bukharin,  con- 
fessed to  improbable  crimes  against  the  Soviet  state.  Their 
confessions  were  quickly  followed  by  execution.  (The  last  of 
Stalin's  old  enemies,  Trotsky,  who  supposedly  had  master- 
minded the  conspiracies  against  Stalin  from  abroad,  was  mur- 
dered in  Mexico  in  1940,  presumably  by  the  NKVD.) 
Coincident  with  the  show  trials  of  the  original  leadership  of  the 
party,  unpublicized  purges  swept  through  the  ranks  of  younger 
leaders  in  party,  government,  industrial  management,  and  cul- 
tural affairs.  Party  purges  in  the  non-Russian  republics  were 
particularly  severe.  The  Yezhovshchina  ("era  of  Yezhov,"  named 
for  NKVD  chief  Nikolay  Yezhov)  ravaged  the  military  as  well, 
leading  to  the  execution  or  incarceration  of  about  half  the  offi- 
cer corps.  The  secret  police  also  terrorized  the  general  popu- 
lace, with  untold  numbers  of  common  people  punished  after 
spurious  accusations.  By  the  time  the  purges  subsided  in  1938, 
millions  of  Soviet  leaders,  officials,  and  other  citizens  had  been 
executed,  imprisoned,  or  exiled. 

The  reasons  for  the  period  of  widespread  purges,  which 
became  known  as  the  Great  Terror,  remain  unclear.  Western 
historians  variously  hypothesize  that  Stalin  created  the  terror 
out  of  a  desire  to  goad  the  population  to  carry  out  his  intensive 
modernization  program,  or  to  atomize  society  to  preclude  dis- 
sent, or  simply  out  of  brutal  paranoia.  Whatever  the  causes,  the 
purges  must  be  viewed  as  having  weakened  the  Soviet  state. 

In  1936,  just  as  the  Great  Terror  was  intensifying,  Stalin 
approved  a  new  Soviet  constitution  to  replace  that  of  1924. 
Hailed  as  "the  most  democratic  constitution  in  the  world,"  the 
1936  document  stipulated  free  and  secret  elections  based  on 
universal  suffrage  and  guaranteed  the  citizenry  a  range  of  civil 


73 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

and  economic  rights.  But  in  practice  the  freedoms  implied  by 
these  rights  were  denied  by  provisions  elsewhere  in  the  consti- 
tution that  indicated  that  the  basic  structure  of  Soviet  society 
could  not  be  changed  and  that  the  party  retained  all  political 
power. 

The  power  of  the  party,  in  turn,  now  was  concentrated  in  the 
persons  of  Stalin  and  the  members  of  his  handpicked  Polit- 
buro. As  if  to  symbolize  the  lack  of  influence  of  the  party  rank 
and  file,  party  congresses  were  convened  less  and  less  fre- 
quently. State  power,  far  from  "withering  away"  after  the  revolu- 
tion as  Karl  Marx  had  prescribed,  instead  grew.  With  Stalin 
consciously  building  what  critics  would  later  describe  as  a  cult 
of  personality,  the  reverence  accorded  him  in  Soviet  society 
gradually  eclipsed  that  given  to  Lenin. 

Mobilization  of  Society 

Concomitant  with  industrialization  and  collectivization,  soci- 
ety also  experienced  wide-ranging  regimentation.  Collective 
enterprises  replaced  individualistic  efforts  across  the  board. 
Not  only  did  the  regime  abolish  private  farms  and  businesses, 
but  it  collectivized  scientific  and  literary  endeavors  as  well.  As 
the  1930s  progressed,  the  revolutionary  experimentation  that 
had  characterized  many  facets  of  cultural  and  social  life  gave 
way  to  conservative  norms. 

Considerations  of  order  and  discipline  dominated  social  pol- 
icy, which  became  an  instrument  of  the  modernization  effort. 
Workers  came  under  strict  labor  codes  demanding  punctuality 
and  discipline,  and  labor  unions  served  as  extensions  of  the 
industrial  ministries.  At  the  same  time,  higher  pay  and  privi- 
leges accrued  to  productive  workers  and  labor  brigades.  To 
provide  greater  social  stability,  the  state  aimed  to  strengthen 
the  family  by  restricting  divorce  and  abolishing  abortion. 

Literature  and  the  arts  came  under  direct  party  control  dur- 
ing the  1930s,  with  mandatory  membership  in  unions  of  writ- 
ers, musicians,  and  other  artists  entailing  adherence  to 
established  standards.  After  1934  the  party  dictated  that  cre- 
ative works  had  to  express  socialistic  spirit  through  traditional 
forms.  This  officially  sanctioned  doctrine,  called  "socialist  real- 
ism," applied  to  all  fields  of  art.  The  state  repressed  works  that 
were  stylistically  innovative  or  lacked  appropriate  content. 

The  party  also  subjected  science  and  the  liberal  arts  to  its 
scrutiny.  Development  of  scientific  theory  in  a  number  of  fields 
had  to  be  based  upon  the  party's  understanding  of  the  Marxist 


74 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


dialectic,  which  derailed  serious  research  in  certain  disciplines. 
The  party  took  a  more  active  role  in  directing  work  in  the 
social  sciences.  In  the  writing  of  history,  the  orthodox  Marxist 
interpretation  employed  in  the  late  1920s  was  modified  to 
include  nationalistic  themes  and  to  stress  the  role  of  great  lead- 
ers to  create  legitimacy  for  Stalin's  dictatorship. 

Education  returned  to  traditional  forms  as  the  party  dis- 
carded the  experimental  programs  of  Lunacharskiy  after  1929. 
Admission  procedures  underwent  modification:  candidates  for 
higher  education  now  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  aca- 
demic records  rather  than  their  class  origins.  Religion  suffered 
from  a  state  policy  of  increased  repression,  starting  with  the 
closure  of  numerous  churches  in  1929.  Persecution  of  clergy 
was  particularly  severe  during  the  purges  of  the  late  1930s, 
when  many  of  the  faithful  went  underground  (see  The  Russian 
Orthodox  Church,  ch.  4). 

Foreign  Policy,  1928-39 

Soviet  foreign  policy  underwent  a  series  of  changes  during 
the  first  decade  of  Stalin's  rule.  Soon  after  assuming  control  of 
the  party,  Stalin  oversaw  a  radicalization  of  Soviet  foreign  pol- 
icy that  paralleled  the  severity  of  his  remaking  of  domestic  pol- 
icy. To  heighten  the  urgency  of  his  demands  for  moderniza- 
tion, Stalin  portrayed  the  Western  powers,  particularly  France, 
as  warmongers  eager  to  attack  the  Soviet  Union.  The  Great 
Depression,  which  seemingly  threatened  to  destroy  world  capi- 
talism in  the  early  1930s,  provided  ideological  justification  for 
the  diplomatic  self-isolation  practiced  by  the  Soviet  Union  in 
that  period.  To  aid  the  triumph  of  communism,  Stalin  resolved 
to  weaken  the  moderate  social  democratic  parties  of  Europe, 
which  seemed  to  be  the  communists'  rivals  for  support  among 
the  working  classes  of  the  Western  world. 

Conversely,  the  Comintern  ordered  the  Communist  Party  of 
Germany  to  aid  the  anti-Soviet  National  Socialist  German 
Workers'  Party  (Nazi  Party)  in  its  bid  for  power,  in  the  hopes 
that  a  Nazi  regime  would  exacerbate  social  tensions  and  pro- 
duce conditions  that  would  lead  to  a  communist  revolution  in 
Germany.  In  pursuing  this  policy,  Stalin  thus  shared  responsi- 
bility for  Adolf  Hitler's  rise  to  power  in  1933  and  its  tragic  con- 
sequences for  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  rest  of  the  world. 

The  dynamics  of  Soviet  foreign  relations  changed  drastically 
after  Stalin  recognized  the  danger  posed  by  Nazi  Germany. 
From  1934  through  1937,  the  Soviet  Union  tried  to  restrain 


75 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

German  militarism  by  building  coalitions  hostile  to  fascism.  In 
the  international  communist  movement,  the  Comintern 
adopted  the  "popular  front"  policy  of  cooperation  with  social- 
ists and  liberals  against  fascism,  thus  reversing  its  line  of  the 
early  1930s.  In  1934  the  Soviet  Union  joined  the  League  of 
Nations,  where  Maksim  Litvinov,  the  Soviet  commissar  of  for- 
eign affairs,  advocated  disarmament  and  collective  security 
against  fascist  aggression.  In  1935  the  Soviet  Union  formed 
defensive  military  alliances  with  France  and  Czechoslovakia, 
and  from  1936  to  1939  it  gave  assistance  to  antifascists  in  the 
Spanish  Civil  War.  The  menace  of  fascist  militarism  to  the 
Soviet  Union  increased  when  Germany  and  Japan  (which 
already  posed  a  substantial  threat  to  the  Soviet  Far  East)  signed 
the  Anti-Comintern  Pact  in  1936.  But  the  West  proved  unwill- 
ing to  counter  German  provocative  behavior,  and  after  France 
and  Britain  acceded  to  Hitler's  demands  for  Czechoslovak  ter- 
ritory at  Munich  in  1938,  Stalin  abandoned  his  efforts  to  forge 
a  collective  security  agreement  with  the  West. 

Convinced  now  that  the  West  would  not  fight  Hitler,  Stalin 
decided  to  come  to  an  understanding  with  Germany.  Signaling 
a  shift  in  foreign  policy,  Vyacheslav  Molotov,  Stalin's  loyal  assis- 
tant, replaced  Litvinov,  who  was  Jewish,  as  commissar  of  foreign 
affairs  in  May  1939.  Hitler,  who  had  decided  to  attack  Poland 
despite  the  guarantees  of  Britain  and  France  to  defend  that 
country,  soon  responded  to  the  changed  Soviet  stance.  While 
Britain  and  France  dilatorily  attempted  to  induce  the  Soviet 
Union  to  join  them  in  pledging  to  protect  Poland,  the  Soviet 
Union  and  Germany  engaged  in  intense  negotiations.  The 
product  of  the  talks  between  the  former  ideological  foes — the 
Nazi-Soviet  Nonaggression  Pact  (also  known  as  the  Molotov- 
Ribbentrop  Pact)  of  August  23,  1939 — shocked  the  world.  The 
open  provisions  of  the  agreement  pledged  absolute  neutrality 
in  the  event  one  of  the  parties  should  become  involved  in  war, 
while  a  secret  protocol  partitioned  Poland  between  the  parties 
and  assigned  Romanian  territory  as  well  as  Estonia  and  Latvia 
(and  later  Lithuania)  to  the  Soviet  sphere  of  influence.  With 
his  eastern  flank  thus  secured,  Hitler  began  the  German  inva- 
sion of  Poland  on  September  1,  1939;  Britain  and  France 
declared  war  on  Germany  two  days  later.  World  War  II  had 
begun. 

The  War  Years 

The  security  that  Stalin  bought  with  the  German  treaty  was 


76 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


short-lived.  Hitler  repudiated  the  agreement  in  1941,  and  Rus- 
sian, Belorussian,  and  Ukrainian  territory  subsequently 
became  the  scene  of  fierce  righting  and  the  eventual  repulsion 
of  a  huge  Nazi  invasion  force.  Stalin  was  able  to  rally  patriotic 
support  for  the  war  effort,  and  Soviet  forces  entered  Berlin  tri- 
umphantly in  April  1945.  Together  with  the  United  States,  the 
Soviet  Union  entered  the  postwar  era  as  a  superpower. 

Prelude  to  War 

When  German  troops  invaded  Poland,  the  Soviet  Union  was 
ill  prepared  to  fight  a  major  war.  Although  military  expendi- 
tures had  increased  dramatically  during  the  1930s  and  the 
standing  army  was  expanded  in  1939,  Soviet  weaponry  was  infe- 
rior to  that  of  the  German  army.  More  important,  eight  of  the 
nation's  top  military  leaders,  including  Marshal  Mikhail  Tukha- 
chevskiy,  had  been  executed  in  1937  in  the  course  of  Stalin's 
purges;  thus  the  armed  forces'  morale  and  effectiveness  were 
diminished.  The  time  gained  through  the  pact  with  the  Nazis 
was  therefore  critical  to  the  recovery  of  Soviet  defenses,  partic- 
ularly because  Hitler's  forces  had  overrun  much  of  Western 
Europe  by  the  summer  of  1940.  To  strengthen  its  western  fron- 
tier, the  Soviet  Union  quickly  secured  the  territory  located  in 
its  sphere  of  interest.  Soviet  forces  seized  eastern  Poland  in 
September  1939;  entered  Estonia,  Latvia,  and  Lithuania  in 
October  1939;  and  seized  the  Romanian  territories  of  Bessara- 
bia (later  incorporated  into  the  Moldavian  Republic)  and 
northern  Bukovina  (later  added  to  the  Ukrainian  Republic)  in 
June  1940.  Only  Finland  resisted  Stalin's  program  of  expan- 
sion, first  by  refusing  to  cede  territory  and  then  by  putting  up  a 
determined  defense  along  the  Mannerheim  Line  when  the 
Red  Army  invaded  in  November  1939.  The  Soviet-Finnish  War 
(also  known  as  the  Winter  War)  of  1939-40  exposed  grave  defi- 
ciencies in  Soviet  military  capabilities,  which  Hitler  undoubt- 
edly noted. 

As  the  European  war  continued  and  the  theaters  of  the  con- 
flict widened,  Hitler  began  to  chafe  under  his  pact  with  the 
Soviet  Union.  The  German  dictator  refused  to  grant  Stalin  a 
free  hand  in  the  Balkans,  instead  moving  the  German  forces 
deeper  into  Eastern  Europe  and  strengthening  his  ties  with 
Finland.  Hitler  thus  prepared  for  war  against  the  Soviet  Union 
under  a  plan  that  he  officially  approved  in  December  1940.  At 
this  point,  however,  Stalin  still  apparently  believed  that  the 
Soviet  Union  could  avert  war  by  appeasing  Germany.  To 


77 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

achieve  this  goal,  regular  shipments  of  Soviet  materials  to  Ger- 
many continued,  and  the  Soviet  armed  forces  were  kept  at  a 
low  stage  of  readiness.  But  despite  Stalin's  efforts  to  mollify  Hit- 
ler, Germany  declared  war  on  the  Soviet  Union  just  as  180  Ger- 
man divisions  swept  across  the  border  early  on  the  morning  of 
June  22,  1941. 

The  Great  Patriotic  War 

The  German  blitzkrieg,  known  as  Operation  Barbarossa, 
nearly  succeeded  in  breaking  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  months 
that  followed.  Caught  unprepared,  the  Soviet  forces  lost  whole 
armies  and  vast  quantities  of  equipment  to  the  German 
onslaught  in  the  first  weeks  of  the  war.  By  November  the  Ger- 
man army  had  seized  the  Ukrainian  Republic,  besieged  Lenin- 
grad, the  Soviet  Union's  second  largest  city,  and  threatened 
Moscow  itself  (see  fig.  5).  The  Great  Patriotic  War,  as  the  Soviet 
Union  and  then  Russia  have  called  that  phase  of  World  War  II, 
thus  began  inauspiciously  for  the  Soviet  Union. 

By  the  end  of  1941,  however,  the  German  forces  had  lost 
their  momentum.  German  movements  were  increasingly 
restricted  by  harsh  winter  weather,  attacks  from  bands  of  parti- 
sans, and  difficulties  in  maintaining  overextended  supply  lines. 
At  the  same  time,  the  Red  Army,  after  recovering  from  the  ini- 
tial blow,  launched  its  first  counterattacks  against  the  invaders 
in  December.  To  ensure  the  army's  ability  to  fight  the  war,  the 
Soviet  authorities  moved  thousands  of  factories  and  their  key 
personnel  from  the  war  zone  to  the  interior  of  the  country — 
often  to  Central  Asia — where  the  plants  began  producing  war 
materiel.  Finally,  the  country  was  bolstered  by  the  prospect  of 
receiving  assistance  from  Britain  and  the  United  States. 

After  a  lull  in  active  hostilities  during  the  winter  of  1941-42, 
the  German  army  renewed  its  offensive,  scoring  a  number  of 
victories  in  the  Ukrainian  Republic,  Crimea,  and  southern  Rus- 
sia in  the  first  half  of  1942.  Then,  in  an  effort  to  gain  control  of 
the  lower  Volga  River  region,  the  German  forces  attempted  to 
capture  the  city  of  Stalingrad  (present-day  Volgograd)  on  the 
west  bank  of  the  river.  Here,  Soviet  forces  put  up  fierce  resis- 
tance even  after  the  Germans  had  reduced  the  city  to  rubble. 
Finally,  Soviet  forces  led  by  General  Georgiy  Zhukov  sur- 
rounded the  German  attackers  and  forced  their  surrender  in 
February  1943.  The  Soviet  victory  at  Stalingrad  proved  deci- 
sive; after  losing  this  battle,  the  Germans  lacked  the  strength  to 
sustain  their  offensive  operations  against  the  Soviet  Union. 


78 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


After  Stalingrad,  the  Soviet  Union  held  the  initiative  for  the 
rest  of  the  war.  By  the  end  of  1943,  the  Red  Army  had  broken 
through  the  German  siege  of  Leningrad  and  recaptured  much 
of  the  Ukrainian  Republic.  By  the  end  of  1944,  the  front  had 
moved  beyond  the  1939  Soviet  frontiers  into  Eastern  Europe. 
With  a  decisive  superiority  in  troops  and  weaponry,  Soviet 
forces  drove  into  eastern  Germany,  capturing  Berlin  in  May 
1945.  The  war  with  Germany  thus  ended  triumphantly  for  the 
Soviet  Union. 

In  gaining  the  victory,  the  Soviet  government  had  to  rely  on 
the  support  of  the  people.  To  increase  popular  enthusiasm  for 
the  war,  Stalin  reshaped  his  domestic  policies  to  heighten  patri- 
otic spirit.  Nationalistic  slogans  replaced  much  of  the  commu- 
nist rhetoric  in  official  pronouncements  and  the  mass  media. 
Active  persecution  of  religion  ceased,  and  in  1943  Stalin 
allowed  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church  to  name  a  patriarch 
(see  Glossary)  after  the  office  had  stood  vacant  for  nearly  two 
decades.  In  the  countryside,  authorities  permitted  greater  free- 
dom on  the  collective  farms.  Harsh  German  rule  in  the  occu- 
pied territories  also  aided  the  Soviet  cause.  Nazi  administrators 
of  conquered  Soviet  territories  made  little  attempt  to  exploit 
the  population's  dissatisfaction  with  Soviet  political  and  eco- 
nomic policies.  Instead,  the  Nazis  preserved  the  collective  farm 
system,  systematically  carried  out  genocidal  policies  against 
Jews,  and  deported  others  (mainly  Ukrainians)  to  work  in  Ger- 
many. Given  these  circumstances,  the  great  majority  of  the 
Soviet  people  chose  to  fight  and  work  on  their  country's  behalf, 
thus  ensuring  the  regime's  survival. 

The  war  with  Germany  also  brought  about  a  temporary  alli- 
ance with  the  two  greatest  powers  in  the  "imperialist  camp," 
namely  Britain  and  the  United  States.  Despite  deep-seated  mis- 
trust between  the  Western  democracies  and  the  Soviet  state, 
the  demands  of  war  made  cooperation  critical.  The  Soviet 
Union  benefited  from  shipments  of  weaponry  and  equipment 
from  the  Western  allies;  during  the  course  of  the  war,  the 
United  States  alone  furnished  supplies  worth  more  than  US$11 
billion.  At  the  same  time,  by  engaging  considerable  German 
resources,  the  Soviet  Union  gave  the  United  States  and  Britain 
time  to  prepare  to  invade  German-occupied  Western  Europe. 

Relations  began  to  sour,  however,  when  the  war  turned  in 
the  Allies'  favor.  The  postponement  of  the  European  invasion 
to  June  1944  became  a  source  of  irritation  to  Stalin,  whose 
country  meanwhile  bore  the  brunt  of  the  struggle  against  Ger-

many.  Then,  as  Soviet  armies  pushed  into  Eastern  Europe,  the 
question  of  the  postwar  order  increased  the  friction  within  the 
coalition.  At  the  Yalta  Conference  in  February  1945,  Stalin 
clashed  with  President  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  and  Prime  Minis- 
ter Winston  Churchill  over  Stalin's  plans  to  extend  Soviet  influ- 
ence to  Poland  after  the  war.  At  the  same  time,  however,  Stalin 
promised  to  join  the  war  against  Japan  ninety  days  after  Ger- 
many had  been  defeated.  Breaking  the  neutrality  pact  that  the 
Soviet  Union  had  concluded  with  Japan  in  April  1941,  the  Red 
Army  entered  the  war  in  East  Asia  several  days  before  Japan 
surrendered  in  August  1945.  Now,  with  all  common  enemies

defeated,  little  remained  to  preserve  the  alliance  between  the 
Western  democracies  and  the  Soviet  Union. 

The  end  of  World  War  II  saw  the  Soviet  Union  emerge  as 
one  of  the  world's  two  great  military  powers.  Its  battle-tested 
forces  occupied  most  of  Eastern  Europe.  The  Soviet  Union  had 
won  island  holdings  from  Japan  and  further  concessions  from 
Finland  (which  had  joined  Germany  in  invading  the  Soviet 
Union  in  1941)  in  addition  to  the  territories  seized  as  a  conse- 
quence of  the  Nazi-Soviet  Nonaggression  Pact.  But  these 
achievements  came  at  a  high  cost.  An  estimated  20  million 
Soviet  soldiers  and  civilians  perished  in  the  war,  the  heaviest 
loss  of  life  of  any  of  the  combatant  countries.  The  war  also 
inflicted  severe  material  losses  throughout  the  vast  territory 
that  had  been  included  in  the  war  zone.  The  suffering  and 
losses  resulting  from  the  war  made  a  lasting  impression  on  the 
Soviet  people  and  leaders  that  influenced  their  behavior  in  the 
postwar  era. 

Reconstruction  and  Cold  War 

The  end  of  the  common  cause  again  exposed  the  underlying 
hostility  between  the  capitalist  countries  and  the  Soviet  Union. 
And  the  favorable  position  in  which  the  Soviet  Union  finished 
World  War  II  rapidly  made  it  the  prime  postwar  threat  to  world 
peace  in  the  eyes  of  Western  policy  makers.  The  so-called  Cold 
War  that  emerged  from  that  situation  featured  Soviet  domina- 
tion of  all  of  Eastern  Europe,  the  development  of  nuclear 
weapons  by  the  Soviet  Union,  and  dangerous  conflicts  and 
near-conflicts  in  several  areas  of  the  world. 

Reconstruction  Years 

Although  the  Soviet  Union  was  victorious  in  World  War  II,  its 
economy  had  been  devastated  in  the  struggle.  Roughly  a  quar- 
ter of  the  country's  capital  resources  had  been  destroyed,  and 
industrial  and  agricultural  output  in  1945  fell  far  short  of  pre- 
war levels.  To  help  rebuild  the  country,  the  Soviet  government 
obtained  limited  credits  from  Britain  and  Sweden  but  refused 
assistance  proposed  by  the  United  States  under  the  economic 
aid  program  known  as  the  Marshall  Plan  (see  Glossary). 
Instead,  the  Soviet  Union  compelled  Soviet-occupied  Eastern 
Europe  to  supply  machinery  and  raw  materials.  Germany  and 
former  Nazi  satellites  (including  Finland)  made  reparations  to 
the  Soviet  Union.  The  Soviet  people  bore  much  of  the  cost  of 


81 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

rebuilding  because  the  reconstruction  program  emphasized 
heavy  industry  while  neglecting  agriculture  and  consumer 
goods.  By  the  time  of  Stalin's  death  in  1953,  steel  production 
was  twice  its  1940  level,  but  the  production  of  many  consumer 
goods  and  foodstuffs  was  lower  than  it  had  been  in  the  late 
1920s. 

During  the  postwar  reconstruction  period,  Stalin  tightened 
domestic  controls,  justifying  the  repression  by  playing  up  the 
threat  of  war  with  the  West.  Many  repatriated  Soviet  citizens 
who  had  lived  abroad  during  the  war,  whether  as  prisoners  of 
war,  forced  laborers,  or  defectors,  were  executed  or  sent  to 
prison  camps.  The  limited  freedoms  granted  in  wartime  to  the 
church  and  to  collective  farmers  were  revoked.  The  party  tight- 
ened its  admission  standards  and  purged  many  who  had 
become  party  members  during  the  war. 

In  1946  An  drey  Zhdanov,  a  close  associate  of  Stalin,  helped 
launch  an  ideological  campaign  designed  to  demonstrate  the 
superiority  of  socialism  over  capitalism  in  all  fields.  This  cam- 
paign, colloquially  known  as  the  Zhdanovshchina  ("era  of 
Zhdanov"),  attacked  writers,  composers,  economists,  histori- 
ans, and  scientists  whose  work  allegedly  manifested  Western 
influence.  Although  Zhdanov  died  in  1948,  the  cultural  purge 
continued  for  several  years  afterward,  stifling  Soviet  intellec- 
tual development.  Another  campaign,  related  to  the 
Zhdanovshchina,  lauded  the  real  or  purported  achievements 
of  past  and  present  Russian  inventors  and  scientists.  In  this 
intellectual  climate,  the  genetic  theories  of  biologist  Trofim 
Lysenko,  which  were  supposedly  derived  from  Marxist  princi- 
ples but  lacked  a  scientific  foundation,  were  imposed  upon 
Soviet  science  to  the  detriment  of  research  and  agricultural 
development.  The  anticosmopolitan  trends  of  these  years 
adversely  affected  Jewish  cultural  and  scientific  figures  in  par- 
ticular. In  general,  a  pronounced  sense  of  Russian  nationalism, 
as  opposed  to  socialist  consciousness,  pervaded  Soviet  society. 

Onset  of  the  Cold  War 

Soon  after  World  War  II,  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  Western 
allies  parted  ways  as  mutual  suspicions  of  the  other's  intentions 
and  actions  flourished.  Eager  to  consolidate  influence  over  a 
number  of  countries  adjacent  to  the  Soviet  Union,  Stalin  pur- 
sued an  aggressive  policy  of  intervention  in  the  domestic  affairs 
of  these  states,  provoking  strong  Western  reaction.  The  United 


82 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


States  worked  to  contain  Soviet  expansion  in  this  period  of 
international  relations  that  came  to  be  known  as  the  Cold  War. 

Mindful  of  the  numerous  invasions  of  Russia  and  the  Soviet 
Union  from  the  West  throughout  history,  Stalin  sought  to  cre- 
ate a  buffer  zone  of  subservient  East  European  countries,  most 
of  which  the  Red  Army  (known  as  the  Soviet  army  after  1946) 
had  occupied  in  the  course  of  the  war.  Taking  advantage  of  its 
military  occupation  of  these  countries,  the  Soviet  Union 
actively  assisted  local  communist  parties  in  coming  to  power.  By 
1948  seven  East  European  countries — Albania,  Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,  Poland,  Romania,  and  Yugoslavia — 
had  communist  governments.  The  Soviet  Union  initially  main- 
tained control  behind  the  "Iron  Curtain"  (a  phrase  coined  by 
Churchill  in  a  1946  speech)  through  the  use  of  troops,  security 
police,  and  the  Soviet  diplomatic  service.  Inequitable  trade 
agreements  with  the  East  European  countries  permitted  the 
Soviet  Union  access  to  valued  resources. 

Soviet  actions  in  Eastern  Europe  generated  hostility  among 
the  Western  states  toward  their  former  ally,  but  they  could  do 
nothing  to  halt  consolidation  of  Soviet  authority  in  that  region 
short  of  going  to  war.  However,  the  United  States  and  its  allies 
had  greater  success  in  halting  Soviet  expansion  in  areas  where 
Soviet  influence  was  more  tenuous.  British  and  American  dip- 
lomatic support  for  Iran  forced  the  Soviet  Union  to  withdraw 
its  troops  from  the  northeastern  part  of  that  country  in  1946. 
Soviet  efforts  to  acquire  territory  from  Turkey  and  to  establish 
a  communist  government  in  Greece  were  stymied  when  the 
United  States  extended  military  and  economic  support  to 
those  countries  under  the  Truman  Doctrine,  a  policy  articu- 
lated by  President  Harry  S.  Truman  in  1947.  Later  that  year, 
the  United  States  introduced  the  Marshall  Plan  for  the  eco- 
nomic recovery  of  other  countries  of  Europe.  The  Soviet 
Union  forbade  the  countries  it  dominated  from  taking  part  in 
the  program,  and  the  Marshall  Plan  contributed  to  a  reduction 
of  Soviet  influence  in  the  participating  West  European  nations. 

Tensions  between  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union 
became  especially  strained  over  the  issue  of  Germany.  At  the 
Potsdam  Conference  of  July-August  1945,  the  Allied  Powers 
confirmed  their  decision  to  divide  Germany  and  the  city  of 
Berlin  into  zones  of  occupation  (with  the  eastern  sectors 
placed  under  Soviet  administration)  until  such  time  as  the 
Allies  would  permit  Germany  to  establish  a  central  govern- 
ment. Disagreements  between  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  West- 


83 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

ern  Allies  soon  arose  over  their  respective  occupation  policies 
and  the  matter  of  reparations.  In  June  1948,  the  Soviet  Union 
cut  off  the  West's  land  access  to  the  American,  British,  and 
French  sectors  of  Berlin  in  retaliation  for  steps  taken  by  the 
United  States  and  Britain  to  unite  Germany.  Britain  and  the 
United  States  thereupon  sponsored  an  airlift  that  kept  the 
beleaguered  sectors  provisioned  until  the  Soviet  Union  lifted 
the  blockade  in  May  1949.  Following  the  Berlin  blockade,  the 
Western  Allies  and  the  Soviet  Union  divided  Germany  into  two 
countries,  one  oriented  to  the  West,  the  other  to  the  East.  The 
crisis  also  provided  the  catalyst  for  the  Western  countries  in 
1949  to  form  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — 
see  Glossary) ,  a  collective  security  system  under  which  conven- 
tional armies  and  nuclear  weapons  would  offset  Soviet  forces. 

While  the  Soviet  Union  gained  a  new  satellite  nation  in  the 
German  Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany),  it  lost  its  influ- 
ence in  Yugoslavia.  The  local  communists  in  Yugoslavia  had 
come  to  power  without  Soviet  assistance,  and  their  leader,  Josip 
Broz  Tito,  refused  to  subordinate  the  country  to  Stalin's  con- 
trol. Tito's  defiance  led  the  Communist  Information  Bureau 
(Gominform — founded  in  1947  to  assume  some  of  the  func- 
tions of  the  Comintern,  which  had  been  abolished  in  1943)  to 
expel  the  Yugoslav  party  from  the  international  communist 
movement  in  1948.  To  avert  the  rise  of  other  independent 
leaders,  Stalin  purged  many  of  the  chief  communists  in  other 
East  European  states. 

In  Asia  the  Chinese  communists,  headed  by  Mao  Zedong 
and  assisted  by  the  Soviet  Union,  achieved  victory  over  the 
Guomindang  in  1949.  Several  months  afterward,  in  1950, 
China  and  the  Soviet  Union  concluded  a  mutual  defense  treaty 
against  Japan  and  the  United  States.  Hard  negotiations  over 
concessions  and  aid  between  the  two  communist  countries 
served  as  an  indication  that  China,  with  its  independent  party 
and  enormous  population,  would  not  become  a  Soviet  satellite, 
although  for  a  time  Sino-Soviet  relations  appeared  particularly 
close.  Elsewhere  in  Asia,  the  Soviet  Union  pursued  a  vigorous 
policy  of  support  for  national  liberation  movements,  especially 
in  Malaya  and  Indochina,  which  were  still  colonies  of  Britain 
and  France,  respectively.  Thinking  that  the  West  would  not 
defend  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea),  Stalin  allowed  or 
encouraged  the  Soviet-equipped  forces  of  the  Democratic  Peo- 
ple's Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  to  invade  South  Korea 
in  1950.  But  forces  from  the  United  States  and  other  members 


84 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


of  the  United  Nations  came  to  the  aid  of  South  Korea,  leading 
China  to  intervene  militarily  on  behalf  of  North  Korea,  proba- 
bly at  Soviet  instigation.  Although  the  Soviet  Union  avoided 
direct  participation  in  the  conflict,  the  Korean  War  (1950-53) 
motivated  the  United  States  to  strengthen  its  military  capability 
and  to  conclude  a  peace  treaty  and  security  pact  with  Japan. 
Chinese  participation  in  the  war  also  strengthened  China's 
independent  position  relative  to  the  Soviet  Union. 

The  Death  of  Stalin 

In  the  early  1950s,  Stalin,  now  an  old  man,  apparently  per- 
mitted his  subordinates  in  the  Politburo  (enlarged  and 
renamed  the  Presidium  in  October  1952)  greater  powers 
within  their  respective  spheres.  Also  at  the  Nineteenth  Party 
Congress,  the  name  of  the  party  was  changed  from  the  All- 
Union  Communist  Party  (Bolshevik)  to  the  Communist  Party 
of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU — see  Glossary),  Indicative  of  the 
Soviet  leader's  waning  strength  was  top  aide  Georgiy  Malen- 
kov's  presentation  of  the  political  report  to  the  congress  in  Sta- 
lin's stead.  Although  the  general  secretary  took  a  smaller  part 
in  the  day-to-day  administration  of  party  affairs,  he  maintained 
his  animosity  toward  potential  enemies.  In  January  1953,  the 
party  newspaper  announced  that  a  group  of  predominantly 
Jewish  doctors  had  murdered  high  Soviet  officials,  including 
Zhdanov.  Western  historians  speculate  that  the  disclosure  of 
this  "doctors'  plot"  may  have  been  a  prelude  to  an  intended 
purge  directed  against  Malenkov,  Molotov,  and  secret  police 
chief  Lavrenti  Beria.  When  Stalin  died  in  March  1953,  under 
circumstances  that  remain  unclear,  his  inner  circle,  which  for 
years  had  lived  in  dread  of  their  leader,  secretly  rejoiced. 

During  his  quarter-century  of  dictatorial  control,  Stalin  had 
overseen  impressive  development  in  the  Soviet  Union.  From  a 
comparatively  backward  agricultural  society,  the  country  had 
been  transformed  into  a  powerful  industrial  state.  But  in  the 
course  of  that  transformation,  many  millions  of  people  had 
been  killed,  and  Stalin's  use  of  repressive  controls  had  become 
an  integral  function  of  his  regime.  The  extent  to  which  Stalin's 
system  would  be  maintained  or  altered  would  be  a  question  of 
vital  concern  to  Soviet  leaders  for  years  after  his  passing. 

The  Khrushchev  Era 

The  end  of  the  Stalin  era  brought  immediate  liberalization 


85 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

in  several  aspects  of  Soviet  life.  Party  leader  Nikita  S.  Khru- 
shchev denounced  Stalin's  tyrannical  reign  in  1956,  signaling  a 
sharp  break  with  the  past.  Because  Khrushchev  lacked  the  all- 
encompassing  power  of  Stalin,  his  time  in  office  was  marked  by 
continuous  maneuvering  against  political  enemies  much  more 
real  than  Stalin's  had  been.  Party  control  of  cultural  activity 
became  much  less  restrictive  with  the  onset  of  the  first  "thaw" 
in  the  mid-1950s.  Khrushchev  attempted  reforms  in  both 
domestic  and  foreign  policy,  with  mixed  results.  During  his  ten- 
ure (1953-64),  world  politics  became  much  more  complex  as 
the  insecurities  of  the  Cold  War  persisted;  Khrushchev  ulti- 
mately was  undone  by  a  combination  of  failed  policy  innova- 
tions in  agriculture,  party  politics,  and  industry. 

Collective  Leadership  and  the  Rise  of  Khrushchev 

Stalin  died  without  naming  an  heir,  and  none  of  his  associ- 
ates had  the  power  to  make  an  immediate  claim  to  supreme 
leadership.  At  first  the  deceased  dictator's  colleagues  tried  to 
rule  jointly,  with  Malenkov  holding  the  top  position  of  prime 
minister.  The  first  challenge  to  this  arrangement  occurred  in 
1953,  when  the  powerful  Beria  plotted  a  coup.  However,  Beria, 
who  had  made  many  enemies  during  his  bloody  term  as  secu- 
rity chief,  was  arrested  and  executed  by  order  of  the  Presidium. 
His  death  reduced  the  inordinate  power  of  the  secret  police, 
although  the  party's  strict  control  over  the  state  security  organs 
ended  only  with  the  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union  itself  (see 
Internal  Security  Before  1991,  ch.  10). 

After  the  elimination  of  Beria,  the  succession  struggle 
became  more  subtle.  Malenkov  found  a  formidable  rival  in 
Khrushchev,  whom  the  Presidium  elected  first  secretary  (Sta- 
lin's title  of  general  secretary  was  abolished  after  his  death)  in 
September  1953.  Of  peasant  background,  Khrushchev  had 
served  as  head  of  the  Ukrainian  party  organization  during  and 
after  World  War  II,  and  he  was  a  member  of  the  Soviet  political 
elite  during  the  late  Stalin  period.  The  rivalry  between  Malen- 
kov and  Khrushchev  manifested  itself  publicly  in  the  contrast 
between  Malenkov's  support  for  increased  production  of  con- 
sumer goods  and  Khrushchev's  stand-pat  backing  for  contin- 
ued development  of  heavy  industry.  After  a  poor  showing  by 
light  industry  and  agriculture,  Malenkov  resigned  as  prime 
minister  in  February  1955.  Because  the  new  prime  minister, 
Nikolay  Bulganin,  had  little  influence  or  real  power,  the  depar- 


86 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


ture  of  Malenkov  made  Khrushchev  the  most  important  figure 
within  the  collective  leadership. 

At  the  Twentieth  Party  Congress,  held  in  February  1956, 
Khrushchev  further  advanced  his  position  within  the  party  by 
denouncing  Stalin's  crimes  in  a  dramatic  "secret  speech."  Khru- 
shchev revealed  that  Stalin  had  arbitrarily  liquidated  thousands 
of  party  members  and  military  leaders,  thereby  contributing  to 
the  initial  Soviet  defeats  in  World  War  II,  and  had  established 
what  Khrushchev  characterized  as  a  pernicious  cult  of  person- 
ality. With  this  speech,  Khrushchev  not  only  distanced  himself 
from  Stalin  and  from  Stalin's  close  associates,  Molotov,  Malen- 
kov, and  Lazar  Kaganovich,  but  he  also  abjured  the  dictator's 
use  of  terror  as  an  instrument  of  policy.  As  a  direct  result  of  the 
"de-Stalinization"  campaign  launched  by  Khrushchev's  speech, 
the  release  of  political  prisoners,  which  had  begun  in  1953,  was 
stepped  up,  and  some  of  Stalin's  victims  were  posthumously 
rehabilitated.  Khrushchev  intensified  his  campaign  against  Sta- 
lin at  the  Twenty-Second  Party  Congress  in  1961,  winning 
approval  to  remove  Stalin's  body  from  the  Lenin  Mausoleum, 
where  it  had  originally  been  interred.  De-Stalinization  encour- 
aged many  in  artistic  and  intellectual  circles  to  speak  out 
against  the  abuses  of  the  former  regime.  Although  Khru- 
shchev's tolerance  for  critical  creative  works  varied  during  his 
tenure,  the  new  cultural  period — known  as  the  "thaw" — repre- 
sented a  clear  break  with  the  repression  of  the  arts  under  Sta- 
lin. 

After  the  Twentieth  Party  Congress,  Khrushchev  continued 
to  expand  his  influence,  although  he  still  faced  opposition.  His 
rivals  in  the  Presidium,  spurred  by  reversals  in  Soviet  foreign 
policy  in  Eastern  Europe  in  1956,  potentially  threatening  eco- 
nomic reforms,  and  the  de-Stalinization  campaign,  united  to 
vote  him  out  of  office  in  June  1957.  Khrushchev,  however, 
demanded  that  the  matter  be  put  to  the  Central  Committee  of 
the  CPSU,  where  he  enjoyed  strong  support.  The  Central  Com- 
mittee overturned  the  Presidium's  decision  and  expelled  Khru- 
shchev's opponents  (Malenkov,  Molotov,  and  Kaganovich), 
whom  Khrushchev  labeled  the  "antiparty  group."  In  a  depar- 
ture from  Stalinist  procedure,  Khrushchev  did  not  order  the 
imprisonment  or  execution  of  his  defeated  rivals  but  instead 
placed  them  in  relatively  minor  offices. 

Khrushchev  moved  to  consolidate  his  power  further  in  the 
ensuing  months.  In  October  he  removed  Marshal  Zhukov  (who 
had  helped  Khrushchev  squelch  the  "antiparty  group")  from 


87 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

the  office  of  defense  minister,  presumably  because  he  feared 
Zhukov's  influence  in  the  armed  forces.  Khrushchev  became 
prime  minister  in  March  1958  when  Bulganin  resigned,  thus 
formally  confirming  his  predominant  position  in  the  state  as 
well  as  in  the  party. 

Despite  his  rank,  Khrushchev  never  exercised  the  dictatorial 
authority  of  Stalin,  nor  did  he  ever  completely  control  the 
party,  even  at  the  peak  of  his  power.  His  attacks  on  members  of 
the  "antiparty  group"  at  the  Twenty-First  Party  Congress  in 
1959  and  the  Twenty-Second  Party  Congress  in  1961  suggest 
that  his  opponents  retained  support  within  the  party.  Khru- 
shchev's relative  political  insecurity  probably  accounted  for 
some  of  his  grandiose  pronouncements,  for  example  his  1961 
promise  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  attain  communism  by 
1980.  His  desire  to  undermine  opposition  and  mollify  critics 
explained  the  nature  of  many  of  his  domestic  reforms  and  the 
vacillations  in  his  foreign  policy  toward  the  West. 

Foreign  Policy  under  Khrushchev 

Almost  immediately  after  Stalin  died,  the  collective  leader- 
ship began  altering  the  conduct  of  Soviet  foreign  policy  to  per- 
mit better  relations  with  the  West  and  new  approaches  to  the 
nonaligned  countries.  Malenkov  introduced  a  change  in  tone 
by  speaking  out  against  nuclear  war  as  a  threat  to  civilization. 
Khrushchev  initially  contradicted  this  position,  saying  capital- 
ism alone  would  be  destroyed  in  a  nuclear  war,  but  he  adopted 
Malenkov's  view  after  securing  his  domestic  political  position. 
In  1955,  to  ease  tensions  between  East  and  West,  Khrushchev 
recognized  permanent  neutrality  for  Austria.  Meeting  Presi- 
dent Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  in  Geneva  later  that  year,  Khru- 
shchev confirmed  a  Soviet  commitment  to  "peaceful 
coexistence"  with  capitalism.  Regarding  the  developing 
nations,  Khrushchev  tried  to  win  the  goodwill  of  their  national 
leaders,  instead  of  following  the  established  Soviet  policy  of 
shunning  the  governments  while  supporting  local  communist 
parties.  Soviet  influence  over  the  international  alignments  of 
India  and  Egypt,  as  well  as  of  other  Third  World  countries, 
began  in  the  middle  of  the  1950s.  Cuba's  entry  into  the  socialist 
camp  in  1961  was  a  coup  for  the  Soviet  Union. 

With  the  gains  of  the  new  diplomacy  came  reversals  as  well. 
By  conceding  Yugoslavia's  independent  approach  to  commu- 
nism in  1955  as  well  as  by  his  de-Stalinization  campaign,  Khru- 
shchev created  an  opening  for  unrest  in  Eastern  Europe,  where 


88

the  policies  of  the  Stalin  era  had  been  particularly  onerous.  In 
Poland,  riots  brought  about  a  change  in  communist  party  lead- 
ership, which  the  Soviet  Union  reluctantly  recognized  in  Octo- 
ber 1956.  A  popular  uprising  against  Soviet  control  then  broke 
out  in  Hungary,  where  the  local  communist  leaders,  headed  by 
Imre  Nagy,  called  for  a  multiparty  political  system  and  with- 
drawal from  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary),  the  defensive  alli- 
ance founded  by  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  East  European 
satellites  in  1955.  The  Soviet  army  crushed  the  revolt  early  in 
November  1956,  causing  numerous  casualties.  Although  the 
Hungarian  Revolution  hurt  Soviet  standing  in  world  opinion,  it 
demonstrated  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  use  force  if  neces- 
sary to  maintain  control  over  its  satellite  states  in  Eastern 
Europe. 

Outside  the  Soviet  sphere  of  control,  China  grew  increas- 
ingly restive  under  Chinese  Communist  Party  chairman  Mao 
Zedong.  Chinese  discontent  with  the  new  Soviet  leadership 
stemmed  from  low  levels  of  Soviet  aid,  feeble  Soviet  support  for 
China  in  its  disputes  with  Taiwan  and  India,  and  the  new  Soviet 
doctrine  of  peaceful  coexistence  with  the  West,  which  Mao 
viewed  as  a  betrayal  of  Marxism-Leninism.  Against  Khru- 
shchev's wishes,  China  embarked  on  a  nuclear  arms  program, 
declaring  in  1960  that  communism  could  defeat  "imperialism" 
in  a  nuclear  war.  The  dispute  between  militant  China  and  the 
more  moderate  Soviet  Union  escalated  into  a  schism  in  the 
world  communist  movement  after  1960.  Albania  left  the  Soviet 
camp  and  became  an  ally  of  China,  Romania  distanced  itself 
from  the  Soviet  Union  in  international  affairs,  and  communist 
parties  around  the  world  split  over  whether  they  should  be  ori- 
ented toward  Moscow  or  Beijing.  The  monolithic  bloc  of  world 
communism  had  shattered. 

Soviet  relations  with  the  West,  especially  the  United  States, 
seesawed  between  moments  of  relative  relaxation  and  periods 
of  tension  and  crisis.  For  his  part,  Khrushchev  wanted  peaceful 
coexistence  with  the  West,  not  only  to  avoid  nuclear  war  but 
also  to  permit  the  Soviet  Union  to  develop  its  economy.  Khru- 
shchev's meetings  with  President  Eisenhower  in  1955  and  Pres- 
ident John  F.  Kennedy  in  1961  and  his  tour  of  the  United  States 
in  1959  demonstrated  the  Soviet  leader's  desire  for  fundamen- 
tally smooth  relations  between  the  West  and  the  Soviet  Union 
and  its  allies.  Yet  Khrushchev  also  needed  to  demonstrate  to 
Soviet  conservatives  and  the  militant  Chinese  that  the  Soviet 
Union  was  a  firm  defender  of  the  socialist  camp.  Thus,  in  1958 


89 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


Khrushchev  challenged  the  status  of  Berlin;  when  the  West 
would  not  yield  to  his  demands  that  the  western  sectors  be 
incorporated  into  East  Germany,  he  approved  the  erection  of 
the  Berlin  Wall  between  the  eastern  and  western  sectors  of  the 
city  in  1961.  To  maintain  national  prestige,  Khrushchev  can- 
celed a  summit  meeting  with  Eisenhower  in  1960  after  Soviet 
air  defense  troops  shot  down  a  United  States  reconnaissance 
aircraft  over  Soviet  territory.  Finally,  mistrust  over  military 
intentions  clouded  East-West  relations  during  this  time.  The 
West  feared  the  implications  of  Soviet  innovations  in  space 
technology  and  saw  in  the  buildup  of  the  Soviet  military  an 
emerging  "missile  gap"  in  the  Soviet  Union's  favor. 

By  contrast,  the  Soviet  Union  felt  threatened  by  a  rearmed 
Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany),  by  a  United 
States  alliance  system  that  seemed  to  be  encircling  the  Soviet 
Union,  and  by  the  West's  superior  strategic  and  economic 
strength.  To  offset  the  United  States  military  advantage  and 
thereby  improve  the  Soviet  negotiating  position,  Khrushchev 
in  1962  tried  to  install  nuclear  missiles  in  Cuba,  but  he  agreed 
to  withdraw  them  after  Kennedy  ordered  a  blockade  around 
the  island  nation.  After  coming  close  to  war  during  the  Cuban 
missile  crisis,  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States  took  steps 
to  reduce  the  nuclear  threat.  In  1963  the  two  countries  estab- 
lished a  "hot  line"  between  Washington  and  Moscow  to  provide 
instant  communication  that  would  reduce  the  likelihood  of 
accidental  nuclear  war.  In  the  same  year,  the  United  States, 
Britain,  and  the  Soviet  Union  signed  the  Limited  Test  Ban 
Treaty,  which  forbade  nuclear  weapons  testing  in  the  atmo- 
sphere. 

Khrushchev's  Reforms  and  Fall 

Throughout  his  years  of  leadership,  Khrushchev  attempted 
to  carry  out  reform  in  a  range  of  fields.  The  problems  of  Soviet 
agriculture,  a  major  concern  of  Khrushchev's,  had  earlier 
attracted  the  attention  of  the  collective  leadership,  which  intro- 
duced important  innovations  in  this  area  of  the  Soviet  econ- 
omy. The  state  encouraged  peasants  to  grow  more  on  their 
private  plots,  increased  payments  for  crops  grown  on  collective 
farms,  and  invested  more  heavily  in  agriculture.  In  his  dramatic 
Virgin  Lands  campaign  in  the  mid-1950s,  Khrushchev  opened 
vast  tracts  of  land  to  farming  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Kazak 
Republic  and  neighboring  areas  of  the  Russian  Republic. 
These  new  farmlands  turned  out  to  be  susceptible  to  droughts, 


90 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


but  in  some  years  they  produced  excellent  harvests.  Later  inno- 
vations by  Khrushchev,  however,  proved  counterproductive. 
His  plans  for  growing  corn  and  increasing  meat  and  dairy  pro- 
duction failed  miserably,  and  his  reorganization  of  collective 
farms  into  larger  units  produced  confusion  in  the  countryside. 

Khrushchev's  attempts  at  reform  in  industry  and  administra- 
tive organization  created  even  greater  problems.  In  a  politically 
motivated  move  to  weaken  the  central  state  bureaucracy,  in 
1957  Khrushchev  did  away  with  the  industrial  ministries  in 
Moscow  and  replaced  them  with  regional  economic  councils. 
Although  he  intended  these  economic  councils  to  be  more 
responsive  to  local  needs,  the  decentralization  of  industry  led 
to  disruption  and  inefficiency.  Connected  with  this  decentrali- 
zation was  Khrushchev's  decision  in  1962  to  recast  party  organi- 
zations along  economic,  rather  than  administrative,  lines.  The 
resulting  bifurcation  of  the  party  apparatus  into  industrial  and 
agricultural  sectors  at  the  oblast  (province)  level  and  below 
contributed  to  the  disarray  and  alienated  many  party  officials 
at  all  levels.  Symptomatic  of  the  country's  economic  difficulties 
was  the  abandonment  in  1963  of  Khrushchev's  special 
seven-year  economic  plan  (1959-65)  two  years  short  of  its  com- 
pletion. 

By  1964  Khrushchev's  prestige  had  been  damaged  in  a  num- 
ber of  areas.  Industrial  growth  had  slowed,  while  agriculture 
showed  no  new  progress.  Abroad,  the  split  with  China,  the  Ber- 
lin crisis,  and  the  Cuban  fiasco  hurt  the  Soviet  Union's  interna- 
tional stature,  and  Khrushchev's  efforts  to  improve  relations 
with  the  West  antagonized  many  in  the  military.  Lastly,  the  1962 
party  reorganization  caused  turmoil  throughout  the  Soviet 
political  chain  of  command.  In  October  1964,  while  Khru- 
shchev was  vacationing  in  Crimea,  the  Presidium  voted  him  out 
of  office  and  refused  to  permit  him  to  take  his  case  to  the  Cen- 
tral Committee.  Khrushchev  retired  as  a  private  citizen  after  his 
successors  denounced  him  for  his  "hare-brained  schemes, 
half-baked  conclusions,  and  hasty  decisions."  Yet  along  with  his 
failed  policies,  Khrushchev  must  also  be  remembered  for  his 
public  disavowal  of  Stalinism  and  the  greater  flexibility  he 
brought  to  Soviet  leadership  after  a  long  period  of  monolithic 
terror. 

The  Brezhnev  Era 

The  regime  that  followed  Khrushchev  took  a  much  more 
conservative  approach  to  most  problems.  Stalinism  did  not 


91 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

return,  but  there  was  less  latitude  for  individual  expression. 
Foreign  relations  continued  to  roller-coaster,  with  the  invasion 
of  Afghanistan  in  1979  constituting  a  major  setback  for  rela- 
tions with  the  West.  The  Soviet  economy  continued  to  falter, 
reaping  no  apparent  benefit  from  the  end  of  Khrushchev's  eco- 
nomic experimentation. 

Collective  Leadership  and  the  Rise  of  Brezhnev 

After  removing  Khrushchev  from  power,  the  leaders  of  the 
Politburo  (as  the  Presidium  was  renamed  in  1966  by  the 
Twenty-Third  Party  Congress)  and  Secretariat  again  estab- 
lished a  collective  leadership.  As  was  the  case  following  Stalin's 
death,  several  individuals,  including  Aleksey  Kosygin,  Nikolay 
Podgornyy,  and  Leonid  I.  Brezhnev,  contended  for  power 
behind  a  facade  of  unity.  Kosygin  accepted  the  position  of 
prime  minister,  which  he  held  until  his  retirement  in  1980. 
Brezhnev,  who  took  the  post  of  first  secretary,  may  have  been 
viewed  originally  by  his  colleagues  as  an  interim  appointee. 

Born  to  a  Russian  worker's  family  in  1906,  Brezhnev  became 
a  Khrushchev  protege  early  in  his  career  and  through  his 
patron's  influence  rose  to  membership  in  the  Presidium.  As  his 
own  power  grew,  Brezhnev  built  up  a  coterie  of  followers  whom 
he,  as  first  secretary,  gradually  maneuvered  into  powerful  posi- 
tions. At  the  same  time,  Brezhnev  slowly  demoted  or  isolated 
possible  contenders  for  his  office.  For  instance,  in  December 
1965  he  succeeded  in  elevating  Podgornyy  to  the  ceremonial 
position  of  chairman  of  the  Presidium  of  the  Supreme  Soviet, 
the  highest  legislative  organization  in  the  government,  thus 
eliminating  him  as  a  rival.  But  Brezhnev's  rise  was  very  gradual; 
only  in  1971,  when  he  succeeded  in  appointing  four  close  asso- 
ciates to  the  Politburo,  did  it  become  clear  that  his  was  the 
most  influential  voice  in  the  collective  leadership.  After  several 
more  personnel  changes,  Brezhnev  assumed  the  chairmanship 
of  the  Presidium  of  the  Supreme  Soviet  in  1977,  confirming  his 
primacy  in  both  party  and  state. 

The  years  after  Khrushchev  were  notable  for  the  stability  of 
the  cadres,  groups  of  activists  in  responsible  and  influential 
positions  in  the  party  and  state  apparatus.  By  introducing  the 
slogan  "Trust  in  Cadres"  in  1965,  Brezhnev  won  the  support  of 
many  bureaucrats  wary  of  the  constant  reorganizations  of  the 
Khrushchev  era  and  eager  for  security  in  established  hierar- 
chies. Indicative  of  the  stability  of  the  period  is  the  fact  that 
nearly  half  of  the  Central  Committee  members  in  1981  were 


92 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


holdovers  from  fifteen  years  earlier.  The  corollary  to  this  stabil- 
ity was  the  aging  of  Soviet  leaders;  the  average  age  of  Politburo 
members  rose  from  fifty-five  in  1966  to  sixty-eight  in  1982.  The 
Soviet  leadership  (or  the  "gerontocracy,"  as  it  was  referred  to  in 
the  West)  became  increasingly  conservative  and  ossified. 

Conservative  policies  characterized  the  regime's  agenda  in 
the  years  after  Khrushchev.  Upon  assuming  power,  the  collec- 
tive leadership  not  only  reversed  such  Khrushchev  policies  as 
the  bifurcation  of  the  party,  it  also  halted  de-Stalinization. 
Indeed,  favorable  references  to  the  dead  dictator  began  to 
appear.  The  Soviet  constitution  of  1977,  although  differing  in 
certain  respects  from  the  1936  Stalin  document,  retained  the 
general  thrust  of  the  latter.  In  contrast  to  the  relative  cultural 
freedom  permitted  during  the  early  Khrushchev  years,  Brezh- 
nev and  his  colleagues  continued  the  more  restrictive  line  of 
the  later  Khrushchev  era.  The  leadership  was  unwilling  or 
unable  to  employ  Stalinist  means  to  control  Soviet  society; 
instead,  it  opted  to  use  repressive  tactics  against  political  dissi- 
dents even  after  the  Soviet  Union  signed  the  Helsinki  Accords 
of  1975,  which  bound  signatory  nations  to  higher  standards  of 
human  rights  observance.  Dissidents  persecuted  during  this 
time  included  writers  and  activists  in  outlawed  religious, 
nationalist,  and  human  rights  movements.  In  the  latter  part  of 
the  Brezhnev  era,  the  regime  tolerated  popular  expressions  of 
anti-Semitism.  Under  conditions  of  "developed  socialism"  (the 
historical  stage  that  the  Soviet  Union  attained  in  1977,  accord- 
ing to  the  CPSU),  the  precepts  of  Marxism-Leninism  were 
taught  and  reinforced  as  a  means  to  bolster  the  authority  of  the 
regime  rather  than  as  a  tool  for  revolutionary  action. 

Foreign  Policy  of  a  Superpower 

A  major  concern  of  Khrushchev's  successors  was  to  reestab- 
lish Soviet  primacy  in  the  community  of  communist  states  by 
undermining  the  influence  of  China.  Although  the  new  lead- 
ers originally  approached  China  without  hostility,  Mao's  con- 
demnation of  Soviet  foreign  policy  as  "revisionist"  and  his 
competition  for  influence  in  the  Third  World  soon  led  to  a 
worsening  of  relations  between  the  two  countries.  The 
Sino-Soviet  relationship  reached  a  low  point  in  1969  when 
clashes  broke  out  along  the  disputed  Ussuri  River  boundary  in 
the  Far  East.  Later,  the  Chinese,  intimidated  by  Soviet  military 
strength,  agreed  not  to  patrol  the  border  area  claimed  by  the 


93 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Soviet  Union;  but  strained  relations  between  the  two  countries 
continued  into  the  early  1980s. 

Under  the  collective  leadership,  the  Soviet  Union  again  used 
force  in  Eastern  Europe,  this  time  in  Czechoslovakia.  In  1968 
reform-minded  elements  of  the  Communist  Party  of  Czecho- 
slovakia rapidly  began  to  liberalize  their  rule,  loosen  censor- 
ship, and  strengthen  Western  ties.  In  response,  Soviet  and 
other  Warsaw  Pact  troops  entered  Czechoslovakia  and  installed 
a  new  regime.  Out  of  these  events  arose  the  so-called  Brezhnev 
Doctrine  (see  Glossary),  which  warned  that  the  Soviet  Union 
would  act  to  maintain  its  hegemony  in  Eastern  Europe  (see 
Central  Europe,  ch.  8).  Soviet  suppression  of  the  reform  move- 
ment reduced  blatant  gestures  of  defiance  on  the  part  of 
Romania  and  served  as  a  threatening  example  to  the  Polish 
Solidarity  trade  union  movement  in  1980.  But  it  also  helped 
disillusion  communist  parties  in  Western  Europe  to  the  extent 
that  by  1977  most  of  the  leading  parties  embraced  Eurocom- 
munism, a  pragmatic  approach  to  ideology  that  freed  them  to 
pursue  political  programs  independent  of  Soviet  dictates. 

Soviet  influence  in  the  developing  world  expanded  some- 
what during  the  1970s.  New  communist  or  left-leaning  govern- 
ments having  close  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  took  power 
in  several  countries,  including  Angola,  Ethiopia,  Mozambique, 
and  Nicaragua.  In  the  Middle  East,  the  Soviet  Union  vied  for 
influence  by  backing  the  Arabs  in  their  dispute  with  Israel. 
After  the  June  1967  War  in  the  Middle  East,  the  Soviet  Union 
rebuilt  the  defeated  Syrian  and  Egyptian  armies,  but  it  suffered 
a  setback  when  Egypt  expelled  Soviet  advisers  from  the  country 
in  1972  and  subsequently  entered  into  a  closer  relationship 
with  the  United  States.  The  Soviet  Union  retained  ties  with 
Syria  and  supported  Palestinians'  claims  to  an  independent 
state.  But  Soviet  prestige  among  moderate  Muslim  states  suf- 
fered in  the  1980s  as  a  result  of  Soviet  military  activities  in 
Afghanistan  (see  The  Middle  East,  ch.  8).  Attempting  to  shore 
up  a  communist  government  in  that  country,  Brezhnev  sent  in 
Soviet  armed  forces  in  December  1979,  but  a  large  part  of  the 
Afghan  population  resisted  both  the  occupiers  and  the  Marxist 
Afghan  regime.  The  resulting  war  in  Afghanistan  continued  to 
be  an  unresolved  problem  for  the  Soviet  Union  at  the  time  of 
Brezhnev's  death  in  1982. 

Soviet  relations  with  the  West  first  improved,  then  deterio- 
rated in  the  years  after  Khrushchev.  The  gradual  winding  down 
of  United  States  involvement  in  the  war  in  Vietnam  after  1968 


94 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


opened  the  way  for  negotiations  between  the  United  States  and 
the  Soviet  Union  on  the  subject  of  nuclear  arms.  The  Treaty  on 
the  Nonproliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  (commonly  known 
as  the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Treaty — NPT;  see  Glossary) 
went  into  effect  in  1970,  and  the  two  countries  began  the  Stra- 
tegic Arms  Limitation  Talks  (SALT)  the  following  year.  At  the 
Moscow  summit  meeting  of  May  1972,  Brezhnev  and  President 
Richard  M.  Nixon  signed  the  Anti-Ballistic  Missile  Treaty  (ABM 
Treaty — see  Glossary)  and  the  Interim  Agreement  on  the  Limi- 
tation of  Strategic  Offensive  Arms.  Both  agreements  essentially 
froze  the  two  countries'  existing  stockpiles  of  strategic  defen- 
sive and  offensive  weapons.  A  period  of  detente,  or  relaxation 
of  tensions,  between  the  two  superpowers  emerged,  with  a  fur- 
ther agreement  concluded  to  establish  ceilings  on  the  number 
of  offensive  weapons  on  both  sides  in  1974.  The  crowning 
achievement  of  the  era  of  detente  was  the  signing  in  1975  of 
the  Helsinki  Accords,  which  ratified  the  postwar  status  quo  in 
Europe  and  bound  the  signatories  to  respect  basic  principles  of 
human  rights.  In  the  years  that  followed,  the  Soviet  Union  was 
found  to  be  in  substantial  violation  of  the  accords'  human 
rights  provisions. 

But  even  during  the  period  of  detente,  the  Soviet  Union 
increased  weapons  deployments,  with  the  result  that  by  the  end 
of  the  1970s  it  achieved  nuclear  parity  with — or  even  superior- 
ity to — the  United  States.  The  Soviet  Union  also  intensified  its 
condemnation  of  the  NATO  alliance  in  an  attempt  to  weaken 
Western  unity.  Although  a  second  SALT  agreement  was  signed 
by  Brezhnev  and  President  Jimmy  Carter  in  Vienna  in  1979, 
after  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan  the  Carter  administra- 
tion withdrew  the  agreement  from  consideration  by  the  United 
States  Senate,  and  detente  effectively  came  to  an  end.  Also  in 
reaction  to  the  Soviet  involvement  in  Afghanistan,  the  United 
States  imposed  a  grain  embargo  on  the  Soviet  Union  and  boy- 
cotted the  Moscow  Summer  Olympics  in  1980.  Tensions 
between  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  continued  up 
to  Brezhnev's  death. 

The  Economy  under  Brezhnev 

Despite  Khrushchev's  tinkering  with  economic  planning,  the 
economic  system  remained  dependent  on  central  plans  drawn 
up  with  no  reference  to  market  mechanisms.  Reformers,  of 
whom  the  economist  Yevsey  Liberman  was  most  noteworthy, 
advocated  greater  freedom  for  individual  enterprises  from  out- 


95 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

side  controls  and  sought  to  turn  the  enterprises'  economic 
objectives  toward  making  a  profit.  Prime  Minister  Kosygin 
championed  Liberman's  proposals  and  succeeded  in  incorpo- 
rating them  into  a  general  economic  reform  program 
approved  in  September  1965.  This  reform  included  scrapping 
Khrushchev's  regional  economic  councils  in  favor  of  resurrect- 
ing the  central  industrial  ministries  of  the  Stalin  era.  Opposi- 
tion from  party  conservatives  and  cautious  managers,  however, 
soon  stalled  the  Liberman  reforms,  forcing  the  state  to  aban- 
don them. 

After  Kosygin' s  short-lived  attempt  to  revamp  the  economic 
system,  planners  reverted  to  drafting  comprehensive  central- 
ized plans  of  the  type  first  developed  under  Stalin.  In  industry, 
plans  stressed  the  heavy  and  defense-related  branches,  slight- 
ing the  light  consumer-goods  branches  (see  The  Postwar 
Growth  Period,  ch.  6).  As  a  developed  industrial  country,  the 
Soviet  Union  by  the  1970s  found  it  increasingly  difficult  to 
maintain  the  high  rates  of  growth  in  the  industrial  sector  that  it 
had  enjoyed  in  earlier  years.  Increasingly  large  investment  and 
labor  inputs  were  required  for  growth,  but  these  inputs  were 
becoming  more  difficult  to  obtain.  Although  the  goals  of  the 
five-year  plans  of  the  1970s  had  been  scaled  down  from  previ- 
ous plans,  the  targets  remained  largely  unmet.  The  industrial 
shortfalls  were  felt  most  sharply  in  the  sphere  of  consumer 
goods,  where  the  public  steadily  demanded  improved  quality 
and  increased  quantity.  Agricultural  development  continued  to 
lag  in  the  Brezhnev  years.  Despite  steadily  higher  investments 
in  agriculture,  growth  under  Brezhnev  fell  below  that  attained 
under  Khrushchev.  Droughts  occurring  intermittently 
throughout  the  1970s  forced  the  Soviet  Union  to  import  large 
quantities  of  grain  from  Western  countries,  including  the 
United  States.  In  the  countryside,  Brezhnev  continued  the 
trend  toward  converting  collective  farms  into  state  farms  and 
raised  the  incomes  of  all  farmworkers.  Despite  the  wage 
increases,  peasants  still  devoted  much  time  and  effort  to  their 
private  plots,  which  provided  the  Soviet  Union  with  a  dispro- 
portionate share  of  its  agricultural  goods  (see  Agriculture,  ch. 
6). 

The  standard  of  living  in  the  Soviet  Union  presented  a  prob- 
lem to  the  Brezhnev  leadership  after  the  growth  of  the  late 
1960s  stalled  at  a  level  well  below  that  of  most  Western  indus- 
trial (and  some  East  European)  countries.  Although  certain 
appliances  and  other  goods  became  more  accessible  during 


96 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


the  1960s  and  1970s,  improvements  in  housing  and  food  sup- 
ply were  slight.  Shortages  of  consumer  goods  encouraged  pil- 
ferage of  government  property  and  the  growth  of  the  black 
market.  Vodka,  however,  remained  readily  available,  and  alco- 
holism was  an  important  factor  in  both  the  declining  life 
expectancy  and  the  rising  infant  mortality  rate  that  the  Soviet 
Union  experienced  in  the  later  Brezhnev  years  (see  Health 
Conditions,  ch.  5). 

Culture  and  the  Arts  in  the  1960s  and  1970s 

Progress  in  developing  the  education  system  was  mixed  dur- 
ing the  Brezhnev  years.  In  the  1960s  and  1970s,  the  percentage 
of  working-age  people  with  at  least  a  secondary  education 
steadily  increased.  Yet  at  the  same  time,  access  to  higher  educa- 
tion grew  more  limited.  By  1980  the  percentage  of  secondary- 
school  graduates  admitted  to  universities  had  dropped  to  only 
two-thirds  of  the  1960  figure.  Students  accepted  into  universi- 
ties increasingly  came  from  professional  families  rather  than 
worker  or  peasant  households.  This  trend  toward  the  perpetua- 
tion of  the  educated  elite  was  not  only  a  function  of  the  supe- 
rior cultural  background  of  elite  families  but  also,  in  many 
cases,  a  result  of  their  power  to  influence  admissions  proce- 
dures (see  The  Soviet  Heritage,  ch.  5). 

Progress  in  science  also  was  variable  under  Brezhnev.  In  the 
most  visible  test  of  its  advancement — the  race  with  the  United 
States  to  put  a  man  on  the  moon — the  Soviet  Union  failed,  but 
through  persistence  the  Soviet  space  program  continued  to 
make  headway  in  other  areas.  In  general,  despite  leads  in  such 
fields  as  metallurgy  and  thermonuclear  fusion,  Soviet  science 
lagged  behind  that  of  the  West,  hampered  in  part  by  the  slow 
development  of  computer  technology. 

In  literature  and  the  arts,  a  greater  variety  of  creative  works 
became  accessible  to  the  public  than  had  previously  been  avail- 
able. As  in  earlier  decades,  the  state  continued  to  determine 
what  could  be  legally  published  or  performed,  punishing  per- 
sistent offenders  with  exile  or  prison.  Nonetheless,  greater 
experimentation  in  art  forms  became  permissible  in  the  1970s, 
with  the  result  that  more  sophisticated  and  subtly  critical  work 
began  to  be  produced.  The  regime  loosened  the  strictures  of 
socialist  realism;  thus,  for  instance,  many  protagonists  of  the 
novels  of  author  Yuriy  Trifonov  concerned  themselves  with 
problems  of  daily  life  rather  than  with  building  socialism.  In 
music,  although  the  state  continued  to  frown  on  such  Western 


97 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

phenomena  as  jazz  and  rock,  it  began  to  permit  Western  musi- 
cal ensembles  specializing  in  these  genres  to  make  limited 
appearances.  But  the  native  balladeer  Vladimir  Vysotskiy, 
widely  popular  in  the  Soviet  Union,  was  denied  official  recogni- 
tion because  of  his  iconoclastic  lyrics  (see  Literature  and  the 
Arts,  ch.  4). 

In  the  religious  life  of  the  Soviet  Union,  a  resurgence  in  pop- 
ular devotion  to  the  major  faiths  became  apparent  in  the  late 
1970s  despite  continued  de  facto  disapproval  on  the  part  of  the 
authorities.  This  revival  may  have  been  connected  with  the  gen- 
erally growing  interest  of  Soviet  citizens  in  their  respective 
national  traditions  (see  The  Russian  Orthodox  Church,  ch.  4). 

The  Death  of  Brezhnev 

Shortly  after  his  cult  of  personality  began  to  take  root  in  the 
mid-1970s,  Brezhnev  began  to  experience  periods  of  ill  health. 
After  Brezhnev  suffered  a  stroke  in  1975,  Politburo  members 
Mikhail  Suslov  and  Andrey  Kirilenko  assumed  some  of  the 
leader's  functions  for  a  time.  Then,  after  another  bout  of  poor 
health  in  1978,  Brezhnev  delegated  more  of  his  responsibilities 
to  Konstantin  U.  Chernenko,  a  longtime  associate  who  soon 
began  to  be  regarded  as  the  heir  apparent.  His  prospects  of 
succeeding  Brezhnev,  however,  were  hurt  by  political  problems 
plaguing  the  general  secretary  in  the  early  1980s.  Not  only 
were  economic  failures  damaging  Brezhnev's  prestige,  but 
scandals  involving  his  family  and  political  allies  also  were 
undermining  his  stature.  Meanwhile,  Yuriy  V.  Andropov,  chief 
of  the  Committee  for  State  Security  (Komitet  gosudarstvennoy 
bezopasnosti — KGB;  see  Glossary),  apparently  also  began  a 
campaign  to  discredit  Brezhnev.  Andropov  took  over  Suslov's 
functions  after  Suslov  died  in  1982,  and  he  used  his  position  to 
promote  himself  as  the  next  CPSU  general  secretary.  Although 
he  suffered  another  stroke  in  March  1982,  Brezhnev  refused  to 
relinquish  his  office.  He  died  that  November. 

The  Soviet  Union  paid  a  high  price  for  the  stability  of  the 
Brezhnev  years.  By  avoiding  necessary  political  and  economic 
change,  the  Brezhnev  leadership  ensured  the  economic  and 
political  decline  that  the  country  experienced  during  the 
1980s.  This  deterioration  of  power  and  prestige  stood  in  sharp 
contrast  to  the  dynamism  that  had  marked  the  Soviet  Union's 
revolutionary  beginnings.

Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


The  Leadership  Transition  Period 

By  1982  the  decrepitude  of  the  Soviet  regime  was  obvious  to 
the  outside  world,  but  the  system  was  not  yet  ready  for  drastic 
change.  The  transition  period  that  separated  the  Brezhnev  and 
Gorbachev  regimes  resembled  the  former  much  more  than  the 
latter,  although  hints  of  reform  emerged  as  early  as  1983. 

The  Andropov  Interregnum 

Two  days  passed  between  Brezhnev's  death  and  the 
announcement  of  the  election  of  Andropov  as  the  new  general 
secretary,  suggesting  to  many  outsiders  that  a  power  struggle 
had  occurred  in  the  Kremlin.  Once  in  power,  however, 
Andropov  wasted  no  time  in  promoting  his  supporters.  In  June 
1983,  he  assumed  the  post  of  chairman  of  the  Presidium  of  the 
Supreme  Soviet,  thus  becoming  the  ceremonial  head  of  state. 
Brezhnev  had  needed  thirteen  years  to  acquire  this  post.  Dur- 
ing his  short  rule,  Andropov  replaced  more  than  one-fifth  of 
the  Soviet  ministers  and  regional  party  first  secretaries  and 
more  than  one-third  of  the  department  heads  within  the  Cen- 
tral Committee  apparatus.  But  Andropov's  ability  to  reshape 
the  top  leadership  was  constrained  by  his  poor  health  and  the 
influence  of  his  rival  Chernenko,  who  had  previously  super- 
vised personnel  matters  in  the  Central  Committee. 

Andropov's  domestic  policy  leaned  heavily  toward  restoring 
discipline  and  order  to  Soviet  society.  He  eschewed  radical 
political  and  economic  reforms,  promoting  instead  a  small 
degree  of  candor  in  politics  and  mild  economic  experiments 
similar  to  those  that  had  been  associated  with  Kosygin  in  the 
mid-1960s.  In  tandem  with  such  economic  experiments, 
Andropov  launched  an  anticorruption  drive  that  reached  high 
into  the  government  and  party  ranks.  Andropov  also  tried  to 
boost  labor  discipline.  Throughout  the  country,  police  stopped 
and  questioned  people  in  parks,  public  baths,  and  shops  dur- 
ing working  hours  in  an  effort  to  reduce  the  rate  of  job  absen- 
teeism. 

In  foreign  affairs,  Andropov  continued  Brezhnev's  policy  of 
projecting  Soviet  power  around  the  world.  United  States-Soviet 
relations,  already  poor  since  the  late  1970s,  began  deteriorat- 
ing more  rapidly  in  March  1983,  when  President  Ronald  W. 
Reagan  described  the  Soviet  Union  as  an  "evil  empire  .  .  .  the 
focus  of  evil  in  the  modern  world,"  and  Soviet  spokesmen 
responded  by  attacking  Reagan's  "bellicose,  lunatic  anticom- 


99 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

munism."  In  September  1983,  the  downing  of  a  South  Korean 
passenger  airplane  by  a  Soviet  jet  fighter  resulted  in  the  deaths 
of  many  United  States  citizens  and  further  chilled  United 
States-Soviet  relations.  United  States-Soviet  arms  control  talks 
on  intermediate-range  nuclear  weapons  in  Europe  were  sus- 
pended by  the  Soviet  Union  in  November  1983  in  response  to 
the  beginning  of  United  States  deployments  of  intermediate- 
range  nuclear  weapons  in  Europe.  The  next  month,  Soviet  offi- 
cials also  walked  out  of  negotiations  on  reducing  the  number 
of  strategic  nuclear  weapons. 

Whether  Andropov  could  have  found  a  way  out  of  the 
depths  to  which  United  States-Soviet  relations  had  fallen,  or 
whether  he  could  have  managed  to  lead  the  country  out  of  its 
stagnation,  will  never  be  known.  The  Andropov  regime  was  to 
last  only  fifteen  months.  The  general  secretary's  health 
declined  rapidly  during  the  tense  summer  and  fall  of  1983,  and 
he  died  in  February  1984  after  disappearing  from  public  view 
for  several  months. 

Andropov's  most  significant  legacy  to  the  Soviet  Union  was 
his  discovery  and  promotion  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev.  Begin- 
ning in  1978,  Gorbachev  advanced  in  two  years  through  the 
Kremlin  hierarchy  to  full  membership  in  the  Politburo.  His 
responsibilities  for  the  appointment  of  personnel  allowed  him 
to  make  the  contacts  and  distribute  the  favors  necessary  for  a 
future  bid  to  become  general  secretary.  At  this  point,  Western 
experts  believed  that  Andropov  was  grooming  Gorbachev  as  his 
successor.  However,  although  Gorbachev  acted  as  a  deputy  to 
the  general  secretary  throughout  Andropov's  illness,  Gor- 
bachev's time  had  not  yet  arrived  when  his  patron  died  early  in 
1984. 

The  Chernenko  Interregnum 

At  seventy-two,  Konstantin  Chernenko  was  in  poor  health 
and  unable  to  play  an  active  role  in  policy  making  when  he  was 
chosen,  after  lengthy  discussion,  to  succeed  Andropov.  But 
Chernenko's  short  time  in  office  did  bring  some  significant 
policy  changes.  The  personnel  changes  and  investigations  into 
corruption  undertaken  by  the  Andropov  regime  came  to  an 
end.  Chernenko  advocated  more  investment  in  consumer 
goods  and  services  and  in  agriculture.  He  also  called  for  a 
reduction  in  the  CPSU's  micromanagement  of  the  economy 
and  greater  attention  to  public  opinion.  However,  KGB  repres- 
sion of  Soviet  dissidents  also  increased.  Stalin  was  rehabilitated 


100 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


as  a  diplomat  and  a  military  leader,  and  there  was  discussion  of 
returning  the  name  Stalingrad  to  the  city  whose  name  had 
been  changed  back  to  Volgograd  during  the  anti-Stalinist  wave 
of  the  1950s.  The  one  major  personnel  change  that  Chernenko 
made  was  the  firing  of  the  chief  of  the  General  Staff,  Nikolay 
Ogarkov,  who  had  advocated  less  spending  on  consumer  goods 
in  favor  of  greater  expenditures  on  weapons  research  and 
development. 

Although  Chernenko  had  called  for  renewed  detente  with 
the  West,  little  progress  was  made  toward  closing  the  rift  in 
East-West  relations  during  his  rule.  The  Soviet  Union  boy- 
cotted the  1984  Summer  Olympics  in  Los  Angeles,  retaliating 
for  the  United  States  boycott  of  the  1980  Summer  Olympics  in 
Moscow.  In  the  late  summer  of  1984,  the  Soviet  Union  also  pre- 
vented a  visit  to  West  Germany  by  East  German  leader  Erich 
Honecker.  Fighting  in  Afghanistan  also  intensified,  but  in  the 
late  autumn  of  1984  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union 
did  agree  to  resume  arms  control  talks  in  early  1985. 

The  poor  state  of  Chernenko's  health  made  the  question  of 
succession  an  acute  one.  Chernenko  gave  Gorbachev  high 
party  positions  that  provided  significant  influence  in  the  Polit- 
buro, and  Gorbachev  was  able  to  gain  the  vital  support  of  For- 
eign Minister  Andrey  Gromyko  in  the  struggle  for  succession. 
When  Chernenko  died  in  March  1985,  Gorbachev  was  well 
positioned  to  assume  power. 

The  Gorbachev  Era 

In  contrast  to  the  uncertain  handling  of  leadership  vacancies 
in  1982  and  1984,  upon  the  death  of  Chernenko  the  Politburo 
acted  within  hours  to  choose  unanimously  the  healthy  and  rela- 
tively youthful  Gorbachev  as  general  secretary.  In  his  speech 
before  the  Central  Committee,  Gorbachev  announced  that  he 
would  emphasize  policies  of  labor  discipline  and  increased  pro- 
ductivity, calling  for  a  "scientific  and  technological  revolution" 
to  revive  heavy  industry. 

Gorbachev's  First  Year 

Gorbachev  quickly  changed  the  composition  of  the  highest 
CPSU  and  government  bodies,  eliminating  Brezhnev-era 
appointees  and  promoting  allies.  Among  the  major  changes  in 
the  July  1985  Central  Committee  plenum,  Gorbachev  pro- 
moted Georgian  party  first  secretary  Eduard  Shevardnadze  to 


101 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

full  membership  in  the  Politburo  and  nominated  him  as  minis- 
ter of  foreign  affairs,  while  Boris  N.  Yeltsin  made  his  national 
political  debut  as  one  of  two  members  added  to  the  CPSU  Sec- 
retariat. In  December  Yeltsin  advanced  again,  this  time  as  first 
secretary  of  the  Moscow  city  committee  of  the  party. 

At  the  Twenty-Seventh  Party  Congress  in  February  1986, 
Gorbachev  reaffirmed  much  of  the  existing  CPSU  doctrine  and 
policies,  giving  little  indication  of  future  reforms.  While  calling 
for  "radical  reforms"  in  the  economy,  he  merely  reemphasized 
the  need  to  increase  production  and  to  use  more  advanced 
technology  in  heavy  industry.  The  new  party  program  con- 
tained no  surprises,  and  the  congress  made  few  changes  in 
high-level  CPSU  bodies.  Among  the  significant  changes  that 
did  occur  were  the  appointment  to  the  Central  Committee  Sec- 
retariat of  Aleksandr  Yakovlev,  an  advocate  of  radical  reform 
and  the  exposure  of  Stalin's  crimes,  and  the  promotion  of 
Yeltsin  to  candidate  membership  in  the  Politburo.  It  was  at  this 
party  gathering  that  Yeltsin  first  offended  conservatives  by 
denouncing  the  hidden  privileges  of  the  party  elite. 

New  Thinking:  Foreign  Policy  under  Gorbachev 

"New  Thinking"  was  Gorbachev's  slogan  for  a  foreign  policy 
based  on  shared  moral  and  ethical  principles  to  solve  global 
problems  rather  than  on  Marxist-Leninist  concepts  of  irrecon- 
cilable conflict  between  capitalism  and  communism.  Rather 
than  flaunt  Soviet  military  power,  Gorbachev  chose  to  exercise 
political  influence,  ranging  from  the  enhancement  of  diplo- 
matic relations  and  economic  cooperation  to  personally  greet- 
ing the  public  in  spur-of-the-moment  encounters  at  home  and 
abroad.  Gorbachev  used  the  world  media  skillfully  and  made 
previously  unimaginable  concessions  in  the  resolution  of 
regional  conflicts  and  arms  negotiations.  In  addition  to  help- 
ing the  Soviet  Union  gain  wider  acceptance  among  the  family 
of  nations,  the  New  Thinking's  conciliatory  policies  toward  the 
West  and  the  loosening  of  Soviet  control  over  Eastern  Europe 
ultimately  led  to  the  collapse  of  communism  and  the  end  of 
the  Cold  War. 

United  States-Soviet  relations  began  to  improve  soon  after 
Gorbachev  became  general  secretary.  The  first  summit  meeting 
between  Reagan  and  Gorbachev  took  place  in  Geneva  in 
November  1985.  The  following  October,  the  two  presidents  dis- 
cussed strategic  arms  reduction  in  Reykjavik,  without  making 
significant  progress.  In  the  late  summer  of  1987,  the  Soviet 


102 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


Union  yielded  on  the  long-standing  issue  of  intermediate- 
range  nuclear  arms  in  Europe;  at  the  Washington  summit  that 
December,  Reagan  and  Gorbachev  signed  the  Intermediate- 
Range  Nuclear  Forces  Treaty  (INF  Treaty — see  Glossary),  elim- 
inating all  intermediate-  and  shorter-range  missiles  from 
Europe.  In  April  1988,  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  signed  an 
accord,  with  the  United  States  and  Soviet  Union  as  guarantors, 
calling  for  withdrawal  of  Soviet  troops  from  Afghanistan  by 
February  1989.  The  Soviet  Union  subsequently  met  the 
accord's  deadline  for  withdrawal. 

Gorbachev  also  assiduously  pursued  closer  relations  with 
China.  Improved  Sino-Soviet  relations  had  long  depended  on 
the  resolution  of  several  issues,  including  Soviet  support  for  the 
Vietnamese  military  presence  in  Cambodia,  the  Soviet  occupa- 
tion of  Afghanistan,  and  the  large  numbers  of  Soviet  troops 
and  weapons  deployed  along  China's  northern  border.  Soviet 
moves  to  resolve  these  issues  led  the  Chinese  government  to 
agree  to  a  summit  meeting  with  Gorbachev  in  Beijing  in  May 
1989,  the  first  since  the  Sino-Soviet  split  in  the  1950s. 

Soviet  relations  with  Europe  improved  markedly  during  the 
Gorbachev  period,  mainly  because  of  the  INF  Treaty  and  Soviet 
acquiescence  to  the  collapse  of  communist  rule  in  Eastern 
Europe  during  1989-90.  Since  the  Soviet-led  invasion  of  Czech- 
oslovakia in  1968,  the  Soviet  Union  had  adhered  to  the  Brezh- 
nev Doctrine  upholding  the  existing  order  in  socialist  states. 
Throughout  the  first  half  of  Gorbachev's  rule,  the  Soviet  Union 
continued  this  policy,  but  in  July  1989,  in  a  speech  to  the  Coun- 
cil of  Europe  (see  Glossary),  Gorbachev  insisted  on  "the  sover- 
eign right  of  each  people  to  choose  their  own  social  system,"  a 
formulation  that  fell  just  short  of  repudiating  the  Brezhnev 
Doctrine.  By  then,  however,  the  Soviet  Union's  control  over  its 
outer  empire  already  was  showing  signs  of  disintegration. 

That  June  the  communist  regime  in  Poland  had  held  rela- 
tively free  parliamentary  elections,  and  the  communists  had 
lost  every  contested  seat.  In  Hungary  the  communist  regime 
had  steadily  accelerated  its  reforms,  rehabilitating  Imre  Nagy, 
the  reform  communist  leader  of  the  1956  uprising,  and  dis- 
mantling fortifications  along  Hungary's  border  with  Austria.  At 
the  end  of  the  summer,  East  German  vacationers  began  escap- 
ing to  the  West  through  this  hole  in  the  Iron  Curtain.  They  also 
poured  into  the  West  German  embassy  in  Prague.  The  East 
German  state  began  to  hemorrhage  as  thousands  of  its  citizens 
sought  a  better  and  freer  life  in  the  West. 


103 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

With  the  East  German  government  under  increasing  pres- 
sure to  stem  the  outflow,  East  Germans  who  stayed  behind 
demonstrated  on  the  streets  for  reform.  When  the  ouster  of 
East  German  communist  party  leader  Honecker  failed  to 
restore  order,  the  authorities  haphazardly  opened  the  Berlin 
Wall  in  November  1989.  The  same  night  the  Berlin  Wall  fell, 
the  Bulgarian  Communist  Party  deposed  its  longtime  leader, 
Todor  Zhivkov.  Two  weeks  later,  Czechoslovakia  embarked  on 
its  "Velvet  Revolution,"  quietly  deposing  the  country's  commu- 
nist leaders.  At  an  impromptu  summit  meeting  in  Malta  in 
December  1989,  Gorbachev  and  United  States  president 
George  H.W.  Bush  declared  an  end  to  the  Cold  War. 

Throughout  1990  and  1991,  Soviet-controlled  institutions  in 
Eastern  Europe  were  dismantled.  At  the  January  1990  Council 
for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glossary) 
summit,  several  East  European  states  called  for  disbanding  that 
fundamental  economic  organization  of  the  Soviet  empire,  and 
the  summit  participants  agreed  to  recast  their  multilateral  ties. 
At  the  next  summit,  in  January  1991,  Comecon  dissolved  itself. 
In  March  1990,  Gorbachev  called  for  converting  the  Warsaw 
Pact  to  a  political  organization,  but  instead  the  body  officially 
disbanded  in  July  1991.  Soviet  troops  were  withdrawn  from 
Central  Europe  over  the  next  four  years — from  Czechoslovakia 
and  Hungary  by  mid-1991  and  from  Poland  in  1993.  By  mid- 
summer 1990,  Gorbachev  and  West  German  chancellor  Hel- 
mut Kohl  had  worked  out  an  agreement  by  which  the  Soviet 
Union  acceded  to  a  unified  Germany  within  NATO. 

By  the  June  1990  Washington  summit,  the  United  States- 
Soviet  relationship  had  improved  to  such  an  extent  that  Gor- 
bachev characterized  it  as  almost  a  "partnership"  between  the 
two  countries,  and  President  Bush  noted  that  the  relationship 
had  "moved  a  long,  long  way  from  the  depths  of  the  Cold  War." 
In  August  1990,  the  Soviet  Union  joined  the  United  States  in 
condemning  the  Iraqi  invasion  of  Kuwait  and  supported 
United  Nations  resolutions  to  restore  Kuwait's  sovereignty.  In 
November  1990,  the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  most 
of  the  European  states  signed  the  Conventional  Forces  in 
Europe  Treaty  (CFE  Treaty — see  Glossary),  making  reductions 
in  battle  tanks,  armored  combat  vehicles,  artillery,  and  fighter 
aircraft  "from  the  Atlantic  Ocean  to  the  Ural  Mountains." 

During  the  Gorbachev  years,  improvements  in  United  States- 
Soviet  relations  were  not  without  complications.  For  example, 
in  1991  Soviet  envoy  Yevgeniy  Primakov's  attempted  mediation 


104 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


of  the  Kuwait  conflict  threatened  to  undercut  the  allied  coali- 
tion's demand  that  Iraq  withdraw  unconditionally  from  Kuwait. 
After  the  signing  of  the  CFE  Treaty,  disputes  arose  over  Soviet 
compliance  with  the  treaty  and  the  Soviet  military's  efforts  to 
redesignate  weapons  or  move  them  so  that  they  would  not  be 
subject  to  the  treaty's  terms.  United  States  pressure  led  to  the 
resolution  of  these  issues,  and  the  CFE  Treaty  entered  into 
force  in  1992.  The  Soviet  crackdown  on  Baltic  independence 
movements  in  January  1991  also  slowed  the  improvement  of 
relations  with  the  United  States. 

By  the  summer  of  1991,  the  United  States-Soviet  relationship 
showed  renewed  signs  of  momentum,  when  Bush  and  Gor- 
bachev met  in  Moscow  to  sign  the  Strategic  Arms  Reduction 
Treaty  (START  I— see  Glossary).  Under  START,  for  the  first 
time  large  numbers  of  intercontinental  ballistic  missiles  were 
slated  for  elimination.  The  treaty  foresaw  a  reduction  of 
approximately  35  percent  in  United  States  ballistic  missile  war- 
heads and  about  50  percent  in  Soviet  ballistic  missile  warheads 
within  seven  years  of  treaty  ratification.  Gorbachev  recently  had 
attended  the  Group  of  Seven  (G-7;  see  Glossary)  summit  to 
discuss  his  proposals  for  Western  aid.  Gorbachev  also  estab- 
lished diplomatic  relations  with  Saudi  Arabia,  South  Korea, 
and,  in  the  waning  days  of  the  Soviet  Union's  existence,  Israel. 

Gorbachev's  foreign  policy  won  him  much  praise  and  admi- 
ration. For  his  efforts  to  reduce  superpower  tensions  around 
the  world,  he  was  awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Peace  in  1990. 
Ironically,  as  a  result  of  frequent  rumors  of  a  conservative 
coup,  the  leader  of  the  Soviet  empire,  whose  previous  rulers 
had  kept  opposition  figures  Lech  Walesa  and  Audrey  Sakharov 
from  collecting  their  Nobel  prizes,  was  unable  to  collect  his 
own  until  June  1991. 

Perestroika 

Domestic  policy  in  the  Gorbachev  era  was  conducted  prima- 
rily under  three  programs,  whose  names  became  household 
words:  perestroika  (rebuilding — see  Glossary),  glasnost  (public 
voicing — see  Glossary),  and  demokratizatsiya  (democratiza- 
tion— see  Glossary) .  The  first  of  these  was  applied  primarily  to 
the  economy,  but  it  was  meant  to  refer  to  society  in  general. 
Over  the  course  of  Soviet  rule,  society  in  the  Soviet  Union  had 
grown  more  urbanized,  better  educated,  and  more  complex. 
Old  methods  of  exhortation  and  coercion  were  inappropriate, 
yet  Brezhnev's  government  had  denied  change  rather  than 


105

mastered  it.  Despite  Andropov's  efforts  to  reintroduce  some 
measure  of  discipline,  the  communist  superpower  remained 
stagnant.  Once  Gorbachev  began  to  call  for  bolder  reforms, 
the  "acceleration"  gave  way  to  perestroika. 

Throughout  the  early  years  of  his  rule,  Gorbachev  spoke  of 
perestroika,  but  only  in  early  1987  did  the  slogan  become  a  full- 
scale  campaign  and  yield  practical  results.  At  that  time,  mea- 
sures were  adopted  on  the  formation  of  cooperatives  and  joint 
ventures  (see  The  Perestroika  Program,  ch.  6).  At  a  plenum  of 
the  CPSU  Central  Committee  in  January  1987,  Gorbachev 
explicitly  applied  the  label  to  his  program  to  devolve  economic 
and  political  control.  In  economics,  perestroika  meant  greater 
leeway  in  decision  making  for  plant  managers,  allowance  for  a 
certain  degree  of  individual  initiative  and  the  chance  to  make  a 
profit. 

In  January  1988,  the  new  Law  on  State  Enterprises  went  into 
effect,  allowing  enterprises  to  set  many  of  their  own  prices  and 
wages.  Results  were  disappointing,  however,  because  workers 
demanded  steep  wage  increases.  As  the  government  printed 
more  money,  products  fetched  higher  prices  outside  the  offi- 
cial economy.  Thus,  goods  usually  sold  in  state  stores  at  fixed 
prices  quickly  disappeared  as  speculators  snatched  them  up  or 
producers  ceased  making  deliveries.  By  September  1988,  many 
staple  products  could  not  be  found  even  in  Moscow.  During 
1988-89  Gorbachev  also  issued  orders  to  the  oblast  party  com- 
mittees to  cease  interfering  in  the  economy,  and  he  cut  the 
staffs  of  state  committees  and  ministries  involved  in  the  econ- 
omy in  order  to  prevent  them  from  further  tampering  with  it. 
Without  the  state  and  the  party  to  hold  it  together  and  guide  it, 
the  economy  went  into  free-fall  (see  Unforeseen  Results  of 
Reform,  ch.  6). 

In  the  summer  of  1990,  Yeltsin,  who  had  been  elected  chair- 
man of  the  Supreme  Soviet  of  the  Russian  Republic  in  May, 
backed  a  radical  economic  reform  plan  that  would  have  spelled 
the  end  of  many  special  interests  within  the  party.  Gorbachev 
in  turn  presented  a  much  less  extreme  "Presidential  Plan," 
which  the  Supreme  Soviet  of  the  Soviet  Union  passed.  Yeltsin 
threatened  that  the  Russian  Republic  would  proceed  with  the 
initial  radical  plan,  but  shortly  thereafter  he  suspended  it. 

In  January  1991,  Gorbachev  replaced  Prime  Minister 
Nikolay  Ryzhkov,  who  had  become  identified  with  the  regime's 
economic  failures,  with  Valentin  Pavlov,  an  opponent  of  radical 
reform.  Pavlov  immediately  created  a  mass  panic  by  withdraw- 


106 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


ing  large-denomination  banknotes  from  circulation  and  limit- 
ing the  public's  ability  to  convert  them  to  lower-denomination 
notes.  The  move,  designed  to  reduce  the  vast  sums  of  money 
circulating  and  to  punish  "black  marketeers"  hoarding  large 
banknotes,  only  intensified  the  people's  mistrust  of  the  Soviet 
government.  The  economy  continued  to  spiral  downward,  and 
Gorbachev  and  Shevardnadze  had  to  ask  the  West  for  financial 
aid  in  order  to  stave  off  collapse.  Gorbachev's  retreat  marked 
the  last  time  economic  reform  dominated  the  agenda  of  a 
Soviet  government. 

Glasnost 

As  perestroika  was  failing,  the  two  policies  designed  to  pro- 
mote it,  glasnost  and  demokratizatsiya,  were  moving  out  of  con- 
trol. To  mobilize  the  populace  in  support  of  perestroika, 
Gorbachev  and  his  aide  Aleksandr  Yakovlev  introduced  glas- 
nost, a  policy  of  liberalized  information  flow  aimed  at  publiciz- 
ing the  corruption  and  inefficiency  of  Brezhnev's  policies  and 
colleagues — qualities  that  the  Russian  public  long  had  recog- 
nized and  accepted  in  its  leadership  but  that  had  never  been 
acknowledged  by  the  Kremlin.  Like  perestroika,  this  policy  had 
unintended  results.  Gorbachev  had  meant  to  shape  the  new 
information  emanating  from  his  government  in  a  way  that 
would  encourage  political  participation  in  support  of  his  eco- 
nomic and  social  programs.  Instead,  the  process  of  calling  into 
question  the  whole  Stalinist  system  inevitably  led  to  questions 
about  the  wisdom  of  Lenin,  the  man  who  had  allowed  Stalin  to 
rise  in  the  first  place.  Because  Lenin  was  the  undisputed 
founder  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  process  then  moved  even  far- 
ther as  open  questioning  signified  that  somehow  the  Soviet 
Union,  supposedly  immune  to  such  doubts,  had  lost  its  raison 
d'etre. 

The  official  announcement  of  glasnost,  scheduled  for  mid- 
1986,  was  overtaken  by  an  event  that  lent  new  meaning  to  the 
term.  In  April  1986,  a  reactor  explosion  at  the  Chernobyl' 
Nuclear  Power  Station,  located  in  northern  Ukraine,  covered 
Belorussia,  the  Baltics,  parts  of  Russia,  and  Scandinavia  with  a 
cloud  of  radioactive  dust  (see  table  3,  Appendix).  The  efforts 
to  contain  the  accident  and  its  attendant  publicity  were  han- 
dled with  exceptional  ineptitude,  setting  glasnost  back  by  six 
months  as  official  news  sources  scrambled  to  control  the  flow 
of  information  to  the  public. 


107 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


Despite  the  clumsy  reaction  of  the  Soviet  government  to  the 
Chernobyl'  episode,  Gorbachev  turned  the  accident  in  his 
favor  by  citing  it  as  an  example  of  the  need  for  economic  pere- 
stroika.  Taking  their  cue  from  Gorbachev,  throughout  the 
Soviet  Union  the  news  media  reported  numerous  examples  of 
mismanagement  of  resources,  waste,  ecological  damage,  and 
the  effects  of  this  damage  on  public  health.  In  the  Soviet 
republics,  these  revelations  had  the  unintended  effect  of  accel- 
erating the  formation  of  popular  fronts  pushing  for  autonomy 
or  independence. 

The  officially  controlled  phase  of  glasnost  began  the  exami- 
nation of  "blank  pages"  in  Soviet  history.  Literary  journals 
filled  up  with  long-suppressed  works  by  writers  such  as  Anna 
Akhmatova,  Joseph  Brodsky,  Mikhail  Bulgakov,  Boris  Paster- 
nak, and  Andrey  Platonov.  Newspapers  and  magazines  carried 
stories  of  Stalin-era  acts  of  repression,  concentration  camps, 
and  mass  graves.  The  works  of  Marxist  theoretician  Nikolay 
Bukharin,  shot  in  1938  for  alleged  rightist  deviation,  appeared. 
By  revealing  communist  party  crimes  against  the  Soviet  peo- 
ples, and  the  peasants  in  particular,  glasnost  further  under- 
mined Soviet  federalism  and  contributed  to  the  breakup  of  the 
Soviet  Union. 

Demokratizatsiya 

By  1987  Gorbachev  had  concluded  that  introducing  his 
reforms  required  more  than  discrediting  the  old  guard.  He 
changed  his  strategy  from  trying  to  work  through  the  CPSU  as 
it  existed  and  instead  embraced  a  degree  of  political  liberaliza- 
tion. In  January  1987,  he  appealed  over  the  heads  of  the  party 
to  the  people  and  called  for  demokratizatsiya,  the  infusion  of 
"democratic"  elements  into  the  Soviet  Union's  sterile,  mono- 
lithic political  process.  For  Gorbachev,  demokratizatsiya  meant 
the  introduction  of  multicandidate — not  multiparty — elections 
for  local  party  and  soviet  offices.  In  this  way,  he  hoped  to  reju- 
venate the  party  with  progressive  personnel  who  would  carry 
out  his  institutional  and  policy  reforms.  The  CPSU  would 
retain  sole  custody  of  the  ballot  box. 

Despite  Gorbachev's  intentions,  the  elements  of  a  multiparty 
system  already  were  crystallizing.  In  contrast  to  previous  Soviet 
rulers,  Gorbachev  had  permitted  the  formation  of  unofficial 
organizations.  In  October  1987,  the  newspaper  of  the  CPSU 
youth,  Komsomol' skay a  pravda,  reported  that  informal  groups, 
so-called  neformaly,  were  "growing  as  fast  as  mushrooms  in  the 


108 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


rain."  The  concerns  of  these  groups  included  the  environment, 
sports,  history,  computers,  philosophy,  art,  literature,  and  the 
preservation  of  historical  landmarks.  In  August  1987,  forty- 
seven  neformaly  held  a  conference  in  Moscow  without  interfer- 
ence from  the  authorities.  In  fact,  one  of  the  unofficial  attend- 
ees was  Yeltsin.  In  early  1988,  some  30,000  neformaly  existed  in 
the  Soviet  Union.  One  year  later,  their  number  had  more  than 
doubled.  These  informal  groups  begot  popular  fronts,  which 
in  turn  spawned  political  parties.  The  first  of  those  parties  was 
the  Democratic  Union,  formed  in  May  1988. 

Gorbachev's  Reform  Dilemma 

Gorbachev  increasingly  found  himself  caught  between  criti- 
cism by  conservatives  who  wanted  to  stop  reform  and  liberals 
who  wanted  to  accelerate  it.  When  one  of  these  groups  pressed 
too  hard,  Gorbachev  resorted  to  political  methods  from  the 
Brezhnev  era.  For  example,  when  Yeltsin-spoke  out  in  1987 
against  the  slow  pace  of  reform,  he  was  stripped  of  his  Polit- 
buro and  Moscow  CPSU  posts.  At  the  party  meeting  where 
Yeltsin  was  removed  from  his  post,  Gorbachev  personally  sub- 
jected him  to  verbal  abuse  reminiscent  of  the  Stalin  era. 

Despite  some  setbacks,  reform  efforts  continued.  In  June 
1988,  at  the  CPSU's  Nineteenth  Party  Conference,  the  first 
held  since  1941,  Gorbachev  launched  radical  reforms  meant  to 
reduce  party  control  of  the  government  apparatus.  He  again 
called  for  multicandidate  elections  for  regional  and  local  legis- 
latures and  party  first  secretaries  and  insisted  on  the  separation 
of  the  government  apparatus  from  party  bodies  at  the  regional 
level  as  well.  In  the  face  of  an  overwhelming  majority  of  conser- 
vatives, Gorbachev  still  was  able  to  rely  on  party  discipline  to 
force  through  acceptance  of  his  reform  proposals.  Experts 
called  the  conference  a  successful  step  in  promoting  party- 
directed  change  from  above. 

At  an  unprecedented  emergency  Central  Committee  ple- 
num called  by  Gorbachev  in  September  1988,  three  stalwart 
old-guard  members  left  the  Politburo  or  lost  positions  of 
power.  Andrey  Gromyko  retired  from  the  Politburo,  Yegor 
Ligachev  was  relieved  of  the  ideology  portfolio  within  the  Sec- 
retariat, and  Boris  Pugo  replaced  Politburo  member  Mikhail 
Solomentsev  as  chairman  of  the  powerful  Party  Control  Com- 
mittee. The  Supreme  Soviet  then  elected  Gorbachev  chairman 
of  the  Presidium  of  the  Supreme  Soviet.  These  changes  meant 
that  the  Secretariat,  until  that  time  solely  responsible  for  the 


109 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

development  and  implementation  of  party  policies,  had  lost 
much  of  its  power. 

Meaningful  changes  also  occurred  in  governmental  struc- 
tures. In  December  1988,  the  Supreme  Soviet  approved  forma- 
tion of  a  Congress  of  People's  Deputies,  which  constitutional 
amendments  had  established  as  the  Soviet  Union's  new  legisla- 
tive body.  The  Supreme  Soviet  then  dissolved  itself.  The 
amendments  called  for  a  smaller  working  body  of  542  mem- 
bers, also  called  the  Supreme  Soviet,  to  be  elected  from  the 
2,250-member  Congress  of  People's  Deputies.  To  ensure  a  com- 
munist majority  in  the  new  parliament,  Gorbachev  reserved 
one-third  of  the  seats  for  the  CPSU  and  other  public  organiza- 
tions. 

The  March  1989  election  of  the  Congress  of  People's  Depu- 
ties marked  the  first  time  that  voters  of  the  Soviet  Union  ever 
chose  the  membership  of  a  national  legislative  body.  The 
results  of  the  election  stunned  the  ruling  elite.  Throughout  the 
country,  voters  crossed  off  the  ballot  unopposed  communist 
candidates,  many  of  them  prominent  party  officials,  taking 
advantage  of  the  nominal  privilege  of  withholding  approval  of 
the  listed  candidates.  However,  the  Congress  of  People's  Depu- 
ties that  emerged  still  contained  87  percent  CPSU  members. 
Genuine  reformists  won  only  some  300  seats. 

In  May  the  initial  session  of  the  Congress  of  People's  Depu- 
ties electrified  the  country.  For  two  weeks  on  live  television, 
deputies  from  around  the  country  railed  against  every  scandal 
and  shortcoming  of  the  Soviet  system  that  could  be  identified. 
Speakers  spared  neither  Gorbachev,  the  KGB,  nor  the  military. 
Nevertheless,  a  conservative  majority  maintained  control  of  the 
congress.  Gorbachev  was  elected  without  opposition  to  the 
chairmanship  of  the  new  Supreme  Soviet;  then  the  Congress  of 
People's  Deputies  elected  a  large  majority  of  old-style  party 
apparatchiks  to  fill  the  membership  of  its  new  legislative  body. 
Outspoken  party  critic  Yeltsin  obtained  a  seat  in  the  Supreme 
Soviet  only  when  another  deputy  relinquished  his  position. 
The  first  Congress  of  People's  Deputies  was  the  last  moment  of 
real  control  for  Gorbachev  over  the  political  life  of  the  Soviet 
Union. 

In  the  summer  of  1989,  the  first  opposition  bloc  in  the  Con- 
gress of  People's  Deputies  formed  under  the  name  of  the  Inter- 
regional Group.  The  members  of  this  body  included  almost  all 
of  the  liberal  members  of  the  opposition.  Its  cochairmen  were 
Yeltsin,  Andrey  Sakharov,  historian  Yuriy  Afanas'yev,  economist

Gavriil  Popov,  and  academician  Viktor  Pal'm.  Afanas'yev 
summed  up  the  importance  of  this  event,  saying,  "It  is  difficult 
for  Gorbachev  to  get  used  to  the  thought  that  he  is  no  longer 
the  sole  leader  of  perestroika.  Other  forces  are  already  fulfilling 
that  role."  Afanas'yev  had  in  mind  not  only  the  Interregional 
Group.  He  also  was  referring  to  the  miners  striking  in  Ukraine, 
Kazakstan,  and  Siberia,  and  the  popular  fronts  in  the  Baltics, 
which  were  agitating  for  independence.  In  January  1990,  a 
group  of  reformist  CPSU  members  announced  the  formation 
of  Democratic  Platform,  the  first  such  CPSU  faction  since 
Lenin  banned  opposition  groups  in  the  1920s. 

A  primary  issue  for  the  opposition  was  the  repeal  of  Article  6 
of  the  constitution,  which  prescribed  the  supremacy  of  the 
CPSU  over  all  the  institutions  in  society.  Faced  with  opposition 
pressure  for  the  repeal  of  Article  6  and  needing  allies  against 
hard-liners  in  the  CPSU,  Gorbachev  obtained  the  repeal  of 
Article  6  by  the  February  1990  Central  Committee  plenum. 
Later  that  month,  before  the  Supreme  Soviet,  he  proposed  the 
creation  of  a  new  office  of  president  of  the  Soviet  Union,  to  be 
elected  by  the  Congress  of  People's  Deputies  rather  than  the 
people.  Accordingly,  in  March  1990  Gorbachev  was  elected  for 
the  third  time  in  eighteen  months  to  a  position  equivalent  to 
Soviet  head  of  state.  Former  first  deputy  chairman  of  the 
Supreme  Soviet  Anatoliy  Luk'yanov  became  chairman  of  the 
Supreme  Soviet. 

By  the  time  of  the  Twenty-Eighth  Party  Congress  in  July 
1990,  the  CPSU  was  regarded  by  liberals,  intellectuals,  and  the 
general  public  as  anachronistic  and  unable  to  lead  the  country. 
The  CPSU  branches  in  many  of  the  fifteen  Soviet  republics 
began  to  split  into  large  pro-sovereignty  and  pro-union  fac- 
tions, further  weakening  central  party  control. 

In  a  series  of  humiliations,  the  CPSU  had  been  separated 
from  the  government  and  stripped  of  its  leading  role  in  society 
and  its  function  in  overseeing  the  national  economy.  For  sev- 
enty years,  it  had  been  the  cohesive  force  that  kept  the  union 
together;  without  the  authority  of  the  party  in  the  Soviet  center, 
the  nationalities  of  the  constituent  republics  pulled  harder 
than  ever  to  break  away  from  the  union. 

Nationality  Ferment 

The  issue  Gorbachev  understood  least  of  all  was  that  of  the 
nationalities.  Stalin,  a  Georgian,  had  been  a  commissar  for 
nationalities,  Khrushchev  had  built  his  career  suppressing 


112 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


Ukrainian  nationalism,  and  Brezhnev  had  risen  through  his 
work  in  Ukraine  and  Moldavia.  Gorbachev  was  a  Russian  whose 
political  background  included  little  time  outside  Russia  proper. 
His  policies  of  glasnost  and  demokratizatsiya,  which  loosened 
authoritarian  controls  over  society,  facilitated  and  fueled  the 
airing  of  national  grievances  in  the  republics.  As  the  peoples  of 
the  Soviet  Union  began  to  assert  their  respective  national  char- 
acters, they  clashed  with  ethnic  minorities  within  their  repub- 
lics and  with  Soviet  authorities  (see  table  4,  Appendix). 

As  early  as  1985,  reports  of  clashes  between  Estonian  and 
Russian  students  began  seeping  into  the  West.  By  1987  the  Bal- 
tic republics  all  had  developed  popular  fronts  and  were  calling 
for  the  restoration  of  their  independence.  In  November  1988, 
Estonia  issued  a  declaration  of  sovereignty,  claiming  that  all 
Estonian  laws  superseded  Soviet  laws.  Lithuania  and  Latvia  fol- 
lowed with  their  own  declarations  of  sovereignty  in  May  and 
July  1989,  respectively. 

The  first  major  flare-up  of  ethnic  violence  came  in  Decem- 
ber 1986,  when  Gorbachev  replaced  the  first  secretary  of  the 
Communist  Party  of  Kazakstan  with  an  ethnic  Russian.  A  large 
crowd  gathered  in  the  Kazakstani  capital,  Alma-Ata  (renamed 
Almaty  after  independence),  to  protest  the  move.  When  a 
force  of  10,000  Soviet  troops  was  deployed  in  Alma-Ata  to  dis- 
perse the  crowds,  demonstrators  rioted. 

In  1987  citizens  of  the  autonomous  oblast  of  Nagorno-Kara- 
bakh, a  landlocked  enclave  of  Armenians  inside  Azerbaijani 
territory,  petitioned  the  Central  Committee,  requesting  that 
the  region  be  made  part  of  the  Armenian  Republic.  The  Cen- 
tral Committee's  rejection  of  this  petition  was  followed  by  dem- 
onstrations in  the  autonomous  oblast  and  similar  displays  of 
sympathy  in  Yerevan,  the  capital  of  Armenia.  A  promise  by  Gor- 
bachev to  establish  a  commission  to  study  the  Karabakh  issue 
provoked  outrage  in  Azerbaijan.  After  an  anti-Armenian 
pogrom  took  place  outside  Baku,  the  Azerbaijani  capital,  large- 
scale  fighting  erupted  between  Armenians  and  Azerbaijanis, 
with  both  groups  claiming  to  have  been  victimized  by  the 
Soviet  regime  in  Moscow.  In  both  republics,  people  rallied 
around  popular  fronts,  which  later  became  movements  for 
independence  from  the  Soviet  Union.  By  the  end  of  1988, 
Georgia  had  developed  its  own  popular  front  as  well.  In  April 
1989,  more  than  twenty  Georgians  were  killed  as  Soviet  troops 
brutally  dispersed  demonstrators  in  the  Georgian  capital, 
Tbilisi.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Ethnic  violence  became  a  frequent  occurrence  throughout 
the  Soviet  Union — in  Uzbekistan's  Fergana  Valley  between 
Uzbeks  and  Meskhetian  Turks,  and  in  Georgia,  when  that 
republic's  Abkhazian  Autonomous  Republic  and  South  Osse- 
tian  Autonomous  Oblast  sought  status  as  separate  Soviet  repub- 
lics. Wherever  Soviet  forces  intervened,  they  either  failed  to 
master  the  situation  or  contributed  to  the  violence.  In  January 
1990,  the  Armenian  Supreme  Soviet  enacted  a  measure  giving 
its  own  legislation  supremacy  over  Soviet  law  In  the  Armenian 
government's  view,  this  meant  that  the  Soviet  demarcation  of 
autonomous  jurisdictions  such  as  Nagorno-Karabakh  no  longer 
was  binding  on  Armenians  in  that  enclave.  That  vote  caused 
rioting  to  break  out  in  Azerbaijan.  When  the  Soviet  govern- 
ment imposed  a  state  of  emergency  in  the  Azerbaijani  capital 
of  Baku  and  deployed  11,000  troops  to  end  the  anti-Armenian 
and  anticommunist  riots,  at  least  eighty-three  Azerbaijanis  were 
killed. 

As  it  had  in  the  republics  along  the  Soviet  southern  perime- 
ter, national  consciousness  reawakened  in  Ukraine  and 
Belorussia.  In  Ukraine  the  first  popular  front,  the  Ukrainian 
Popular  Movement  for  Perestroika,  known  as  Rukh,  held  its 
founding  congress  in  September  1989.  On  March  4,  1990, 
Ukraine  and  Belorussia  elected  new  legislatures.  In  both  cases, 
opposition  movements  and  coalitions  made  good  showings 
despite  ballot  tampering  and  legal  obstacles  erected  by  authori- 
ties. 

In  March  1990,  Lithuania  declared  independence,  and  Gor- 
bachev imposed  a  partial  economic  blockade  in  response.  That 
same  year,  riots  also  took  place  in  Tajikistan  and  in  the  Kyrgyz 
city  of  Osh,  leading  to  hundreds  of  deaths  and  the  imposition 
of  a  state  of  emergency  in  several  areas  of  Kyrgyzstan.  The  Mol- 
davian government  also  declared  a  state  of  emergency  when 
Gagauz  separatists  tried  to  declare  the  independence  of  their 
region,  prompting  Gorbachev  to  deploy  troops  from  the  Minis- 
try of  Internal  Affairs  in  Moldavia.  Violence  between  ethic 
Romanian  Moldavians  and  Russians  broke  out  in  the  Transnis- 
tria  region  of  the  republic  a  few  weeks  later.  In  October  1990, 
multiparty  legislative  elections  in  Georgia  resulted  in  victory 
for  the  pro-independence  bloc,  and  the  new  Supreme  Soviet  in 
Tbilisi  began  to  move  toward  declaring  independence.  The 
major  challenge  to  Gorbachev,  however,  came  not  from  the 
non-Russian  constituent  republics  but  from  Russia  itself.

Many  institutions  that  existed  in  the  other  constituent 
republics  did  not  exist  in  Russia.  Russia  had  no  television  sta- 
tions addressing  specifically  Russian  interests.  Unlike  other 
republics,  the  Russian  Republic  had  no  academy  of  sciences 
(see  Glossary).  It  also  lacked  a  ministry  of  internal  affairs,  a 
republic-level  KGB,  and  a  Russian  communist  party.  Between 
1918  and  1925,  the  GPSU  had  been  called  the  Russian  Commu- 
nist Party  (Bolshevik),  but  it  was  known  as  the  All-Union  Com- 
munist Party  (Bolshevik)  from  1925  until  1952  when  Stalin 
changed  the  name  to  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet 
Union. 

Such  a  policy  by  the  communists  had  aimed  at  tying  the  Rus- 
sian people  as  closely  as  possible  to  the  Soviet  state.  The  strat- 
egy was  based  on  the  belief  that,  lacking  internal  security  forces 
and  the  political  base  that  would  be  furnished  by  a  Russian 
communist  party,  the  Russians  would  be  unlikely  to  engage  in 


115

opposition  to  the  system.  By  1990,  however,  Russians  were 
beginning  to  think  differently.  Although  the  predominantly 
Russian  CPSU  promoted  policies  of  Russification  to  facilitate 
its  rule  and  to  placate  the  large  Russian  population,  in  the  late 
1980s  average  Russians  increasingly  saw  the  CPSU's  efforts  to 
co-opt  and  coerce  the  other  nationalities  as  debasing  the  Rus- 
sian language  and  culture  and  depleting  Russian  natural  and 
financial  resources.  Gorbachev  viewed  this  growing  body  of 
opinion  with  fear,  but  Yeltsin,  who  had  been  learning  from  the 
Baltic  republics'  struggle,  saw  it  as  providing  an  opportunity. 
Yeltsin  took  up  the  cause  of  Russia's  rights  within  the  union, 
making  alliances  with  both  Russian  nationalists  and  Russian  lib- 
erals. 

In  July  1990,  Gorbachev  finally  acceded  to  the  founding  of 
the  Russian  Communist  Party,  which  became  a  bastion  of  Rus- 
sian nationalist  conservatism  and  opposition  to  Gorbachev. 
The  party  failed  to  gain  control  of  the  Russian  Republic's  legis- 
lative bodies,  however.  Instead,  it  faced  formidable  competi- 
tion in  the  Russian  Congress  of  People's  Deputies,  which  by 
that  time  was  dominated  by  Yeltsin.  Yeltsin's  May  1990  election 
as  chairman  of  the  Russian  Supreme  Soviet  had  made  him  the 
de  facto  president  of  the  Russian  Republic,  just  as  Gorbachev's 
election  as  chairman  of  the  Supreme  Soviet  of  the  Soviet 
Union  had  made  him  de  facto  president  of  the  country  in 
1989. 

Yeltsin's  new  position  enabled  him  to  pose  a  serious  chal- 
lenge to  Gorbachev.  On  June  11,  1990,  Russia  issued  its  declara- 
tion of  sovereignty,  the  first  republic  to  do  so  after  the  Baltic 
states.  This  move  challenged  Soviet  jurisdiction  over  the  very 
heart  of  the  union.  By  the  end  of  November,  another  nine 
republics  had  followed  Russia's  lead.  The  last  instance  of  coop- 
eration between  Yeltsin  and  Gorbachev  in  this  period  was  their 
effort  in  the  fall  of  1990  to  draft  a  common  economic  policy. 
However,  Gorbachev's  desire  to  protect  the  favored  position  of 
the  military-industrial  establishment  caused  the  effort  to 
founder  and  the  two  men's  relationship  to  deteriorate  rapidly. 

As  the  leader  of  the  most  populous  and  richest  union  repub- 
lic, Yeltsin  became  the  champion  of  all  the  republics'  rights 
against  control  from  the  center.  However,  he  did  not  advocate 
the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Yeltsin  originally  hoped  for 
the  creation  of  a  new  federation  anchored  by  bilateral  and  mul- 
tilateral treaties  between  and  among  the  union  republics,  with 
Russia  as  the  preeminent  member.  When  Soviet  forces  cracked 


116 


Historical  Setting:  1917  to  1991 


down  on  the  Baltic  states  in  January  1991,  Yeltsin  went  to  Esto- 
nia in  a  show  of  support  for  the  Baltics,  signing  agreements 
with  the  Baltic  states  that  recognized  their  borders  and  promis- 
ing assistance  in  the  event  of  an  attack  on  them  from  the  Soviet 
center. 

In  June  1990,  Gorbachev  already  had  initiated  talks  on  a  new 
union  treaty.  The  Supreme  Soviet  debated  provisions  of  a  draft 
union  treaty  throughout  1990  and  into  1991.  With  tensions 
increasing  between  the  center  and  the  constituent  republics, 
Gorbachev  scheduled  a  national  referendum  in  March  1991. 
The  Baltic  states,  Armenia,  Georgia,  and  Moldavia  refused  to 
participate.  In  the  Russian  referendum,  Yeltsin  included  a 
question  on  the  creation  of  a  Russian  presidential  post.  The 
overall  referendum  vote  gave  approval  to  Gorbachev's  position 
on  preserving  the  union,  but  the  voters  in  Russia  also  approved 
Yeltsin's  call  for  a  president  elected  directly  by  the  people.  On 
June  12,  Yeltsin,  whose  popularity  had  risen  steadily  as  Gor- 
bachev's plummeted,  was  elected  president  of  the  Russian 
Republic  with  57  percent  of  the  vote. 

The  August  Coup  and  Its  Aftermath 

Gorbachev  hoped  that  he  could  at  least  hold  the  union 
together  in  a  decentralized  form.  However,  in  the  eyes  of  the 
remaining  CPSU  conservatives,  he  had  gone  too  far  because 
his  new  union  treaty  dispersed  too  much  of  the  central  govern- 
ment's power  to  the  republics.  On  August  19,  1991,  one  day 
before  Gorbachev  and  a  group  of  republic  leaders  were  due  to 
sign  the  union  treaty,  a  group  calling  itself  the  State  Emergency 
Committee  attempted  to  seize  power  in  Moscow.  The  group 
announced  that  Gorbachev  was  ill  and  had  been  relieved  of  his 
state  post  as  president.  Soviet  Union  vice  president  Gennadiy 
Yanayev  was  named  acting  president.  The  committee's  eight 
members  included  KGB  chairman  Vladimir  Kryuchkov,  Inter- 
nal Affairs  Minister  Pugo,  Defense  Minister  Dmitriy  Yazov,  and 
Prime  Minister  Pavlov,  all  of  whom  had  risen  to  their  posts 
under  Gorbachev. 

Large  public  demonstrations  against  the  coup  leaders  took 
place  in  Moscow  and  Leningrad,  and  divided  loyalties  in  the 
defense  and  security  establishments  prevented  the  armed 
forces  from  crushing  the  resistance  that  Yeltsin  led  from  Rus- 
sia's parliament  building.  On  August  21,  the  coup  collapsed, 
and  Gorbachev  returned  to  Moscow. 


117 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Once  back  in  Moscow,  Gorbachev  acted  as  if  he  were  oblivi- 
ous to  the  changes  that  had  occurred  in  the  preceding  three 
days.  As  he  returned  to  power,  Gorbachev  promised  to  purge 
conservatives  from  the  CPSU.  He  resigned  as  general  secretary 
but  remained  president  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  coup's  failure 
brought  a  series  of  collapses  of  all-union  institutions.  Yeltsin 
took  control  of  the  central  broadcasting  company  and  key  eco- 
nomic ministries  and  agencies,  and  in  November  he  banned 
the  CPSU  and  the  Russian  Communist  Party. 

By  December  1991,  all  of  the  republics  had  declared  inde- 
pendence, and  negotiations  over  a  new  union  treaty  began 
anew.  Both  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States  had  recog- 
nized the  independence  of  the  Baltic  republics  in  September. 
For  several  months  after  his  return  to  Moscow,  Gorbachev  and 
his  aides  made  futile  attempts  to  restore  stability  and  legitimacy 
to  the  central  institutions.  In  November  seven  republics  agreed 
to  a  new  union  treaty  that  would  form  a  confederation  called 
the  Union  of  Sovereign  States.  But  Ukraine  was  unrepresented 
in  that  group,  and  Yeltsin  soon  withdrew  to  seek  additional 
advantages  for  Russia.  In  the  absence  of  the  CPSU,  there  was 
no  way  to  keep  the  Soviet  Union  together.  From  Yeltsin's  per- 
spective, Russia's  participation  in  another  union  would  be 
senseless  because  inevitably  Russia  would  assume  responsibility 
for  the  increasingly  severe  economic  woes  of  the  other  repub- 
lics. 

On  December  8,  Yeltsin  and  the  leaders  of  Belarus  (which 
adopted  that  name  in  August  1991)  and  Ukraine  met  at  Minsk, 
the  capital  of  Belarus,  where  they  created  the  Commonwealth 
of  Independent  States  (CIS — see  Glossary)  and  annulled  the 
1922  union  treaty  that  had  established  the  Soviet  Union. 
Another  signing  ceremony  was  held  in  Alma-Ata  on  December 
21  to  expand  the  CIS  to  include  the  five  republics  of  Central 
Asia,  Armenia,  and  Azerbaijan.  Georgia  did  not  join  until  1993; 
the  three  Baltic  republics  never  joined.  On  December  25, 1991, 
the  Soviet  Union  ceased  to  exist.  Exactly  six  years  after  Gor- 
bachev had  appointed  Boris  Yeltsin  to  run  the  Moscow  city 
committee  of  the  party,  Yeltsin  now  was  president  of  the  largest 
successor  state  to  the  Soviet  Union.

Chapter  3.  Physical  Environment  and  Population 


A  peasant  named  Ivan  rides  a  humpbacked  pony,  which  has  very  long  ears,  on 
a  quest  to  the  Palace  of  the  Moon  (design  from  lacquer  box  made  in  village  of 
Palekh). 


CURVING  AROUND  THE  NORTH  POLE  in  a  huge  arc,  Rus- 
sia (the  Russian  Federation)  spans  almost  half  the  globe  from 
east  to  west  and  about  4,000  kilometers  from  north  to  south. 
Divided  into  eleven  time  zones,  Russia  is  by  far  the  world's  larg- 
est country.  It  occupies  much  of  Eastern  Europe  and  northern 
Asia.  The  country's  terrain  is  diverse,  with  extensive  stands  of 
forest,  numerous  mountain  ranges,  and  vast  plains.  On  and 
below  the  surface  of  the  land  are  extensive  reserves  of  natural 
resources  that  provide  the  nation  with  enormous  potential 
wealth.  Russia  ranks  sixth  in  the  world  in  population,  trailing 
China,  India,  the  United  States,  Indonesia,  and  Brazil.  The 
population  is  as  varied  as  the  terrain.  Slavs  (Russians,  Ukraini- 
ans, and  Belarusians)  are  the  most  numerous  of  the  more  than 
100  European  and  Asiatic  nationalities. 

The  Ural  Mountains,  which  extend  more  than  2,200  kilome- 
ters from  north  to  south,  form  the  boundary  separating  the 
unequal  European  and  Asian  sectors  of  Russia.  The  continen- 
tal divide  continues  another  1,375  kilometers  from  the  south- 
ern end  of  the  Ural  Mountains  through  the  Caspian  Sea  and 
along  the  Caucasus  Mountains.  Asian  Russia  is  about  as  large  as 
China  and  India  combined,  occupying  roughly  three-quarters 
of  the  nation's  territory.  But  it  is  the  European  western  quarter 
that  is  home  to  more  than  75  percent  of  Russia's  inhabitants. 
This  acutely  uneven  distribution  of  human  and  natural 
resources  is  a  striking  feature  of  Russian  geography  and  popu- 
lation. Despite  government  attempts  to  settle  people  in 
sparsely  populated  Asian  areas  abundant  in  resources,  this 
imbalance  persists.  Meanwhile,  depletion  of  water  and  fuel 
resources  in  the  European  part  outpaces  exploitation  of 
resource-rich  Siberia,  the  famously  forbidding  land  stretching 
from  the  Urals  to  the  Pacific  Ocean.  From  1970  to  1989,  the 
campaign  to  settle  and  exploit  western  Siberia's  plentiful  fuel 
and  energy  supplies  was  expensive  and  only  partially  successful. 
Since  glasnost  (see  Glossary),  revelations  of  extreme  environ- 
mental degradation  have  tarnished  the  image  of  the  Siberian 
development  program. 

The  Soviet  and  Russian  environmental  record  has  been  gen- 
erally dismal.  Seven  decades  of  Soviet  rule  left  irradiated  land- 
scapes and  marine  ecosystems,  a  desiccated  inland  sea, 
befouled  rivers,  and  toxic  urban  air  as  reminders  of  the  conse- 


123 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

quences  of  seeking  industrialization  at  any  price.  Russia  and 
the  other  Soviet  republics  responded  to  the  pressures  of  the 
long  and  costly  Cold  War  by  developing  a  defense-oriented, 
production-obsessed  economy  amid  ecological  devastation. 
Without  a  genuine  environmental  movement  until  its  final 
years,  the  Soviet  Union  left  in  its  wake  an  environmental  catas- 
trophe that  will  take  decades  and  perhaps  trillions  of  dollars  to 
repair  even  partially. 

During  the  Soviet  period,  natural  and  geopolitical  phenom- 
ena shaped  the  characteristics  of  Russia's  population.  In  that 
period,  wars,  epidemics,  famines,  and  state-sanctioned  mass 
killings  claimed  millions  of  victims.  Before  the  1950s,  each 
decade  brought  to  the  population  of  the  former  Russian 
Republic  some  form  of  cataclysmic  demographic  event. 
Demographers  have  calculated  that  a  total  of  33.6  million  peo- 
ple died  from  a  brutal  collectivization  process  and  the  famine 
that  ensued  in  the  1920s  and  1930s,  the  Great  Terror  of  Joseph 
V.  Stalin  (in  office  1927-53)  in  the  1930s,  and  World  War  II 
(see  Transformation  and  Terror,  ch.  2).  Although  those  events 
ended  more  than  fifty  years  ago,  such  disasters  have  had  signifi- 
cant long-term  effects.  In  age-groups  above  forty-five,  women 
greatly  outnumber  men. 

In  the  1990s,  demographers  and  policy  makers  are  con- 
cerned about  alarming  trends  such  as  a  plummeting  birthrate, 
increasing  mortality  among  able-bodied  males,  and  declining 
life  expectancy.  Another  demographic  concern  is  the  millions 
of  Russians  remaining  in  the  other  newly  independent  coun- 
tries of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  called  by  policy  makers  the 
"near  abroad."  These  Russians  or  their  forebears  resettled 
under  a  variety  of  conditions.  Russian  authorities  fear  that 
social  and  ethnic  upheaval  in  those  states  could  trigger  the 
mass  migration  of  Russians  into  the  federation,  which  is  ill 
equipped  to  integrate  such  numbers  into  its  economy  and  soci- 
ety. By  the  early  1990s,  Russia  had  already  become  the  destina- 
tion of  greatly  increased  numbers  of  immigrants. 

In  1995  the  population  of  the  Russian  Federation  was  esti- 
mated at  slightly  less  than  150  million.  Whereas  Russians  had 
accounted  for  only  about  50  percent  of  the  Soviet  Union's  pop- 
ulation, in  Russia  they  are  a  clear  majority  of  82  percent  of  the 
population  in  what  remains  a  distinctively  multicultural,  multi- 
national state  (see  Ethnic  Composition,  ch.  4).

Physical  Environment  and  Population 

Physical  Environment 

Russia's  topography  includes  the  world's  deepest  lake  and 
Europe's  highest  mountain  and  longest  river.  The  topography 
and  climate,  however,  resemble  those  of  the  northernmost  por- 
tion of  the  North  American  continent.  The  northern  forests 
and  the  plains  bordering  them  to  the  south  find  their  closest 
counterparts  in  the  Yukon  Territory  and  in  the  wide  swath  of 
land  extending  across  most  of  Canada.  The  terrain,  climate, 
and  settlement  patterns  of  Siberia  are  similar  to  those  of  Alaska 
and  Canada. 

Global  Position  and  Boundaries 

Located  in  the  northern  and  middle  latitudes  of  the  North- 
ern Hemisphere,  most  of  Russia  is  much  closer  to  the  North 
Pole  than  to  the  equator.  Individual  country  comparisons  are 
of  little  value  in  gauging  Russia's  enormous  size  (slightly  less 
than  twice  that  of  the  United  States)  and  diversity.  The  coun- 
try's 17.1  million  square  kilometers  include  one-eighth  of  the 
earth's  inhabited  land  area.  Its  European  portion,  which  occu- 
pies a  substantial  part  of  continental  Europe,  is  home  to  most 
of  Russia's  industrial  and  agricultural  activity.  It  was  here, 
roughly  between  the  Dnepr  River  and  the  Ural  Mountains,  that 
the  Russian  Empire  took  shape  after  the  principality  of  Mus- 
covy gradually  expanded  eastward  to  reach  the  Pacific  Ocean 
in  the  seventeenth  century  (see  Expansion  and  Westernization, 
ch.  1). 

Russia  extends  about  9,000  kilometers  from  westernmost 
Kaliningrad  Oblast,  the  now-isolated  region  cut  off  from  the 
rest  of  Russia  by  the  independence  of  Belarus,  Latvia,  and 
Lithuania,  to  Ratmanova  Island  (Big  Diomede  Island)  in  the 
Bering  Strait.  This  distance  is  roughly  equivalent  to  the  dis- 
tance from  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  east  to  Nome,  Alaska. 
Between  the  northern  tip  of  the  Arctic  island  of  Novaya  Zemlya 
to  the  southern  tip  of  the  Republic  of  Dagestan  on  the  Caspian 
Sea  is  about  3,800  kilometers  of  extremely  varied,  often  inhos- 
pitable terrain. 

Extending  for  57,792  kilometers,  the  Russian  border  is  the 
world's  longest — and,  in  the  post-Soviet  era,  a  source  of  sub- 
stantial concern  for  national  security.  Along  the  20,139-kilome- 
ter land  frontier,  Russia  has  boundaries  with  fourteen 
countries.  New  neighbors  are  eight  countries  of  the  near 
abroad — Kazakstan  in  Asia,  and,  in  Europe,  Estonia,  Latvia, 


125 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Lithuania,  Belarus,  Ukraine,  Georgia,  and  Azerbaijan.  Other 
neighbors  include  the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea 
(North  Korea),  China,  Mongolia,  Poland,  Norway,  and  Fin- 
land. And,  at  the  far  northeastern  extremity,  eighty-six  kilome- 
ters of  the  Bering  Strait  separate  Russia  from  a  fifteenth 
neighbor — the  United  States  (see  fig.  6). 

Approximately  two-thirds  of  the  frontier  is  bounded  by 
water.  Virtually  all  of  the  lengthy  northern  coast  is  well  above 
the  Arctic  Circle;  except  for  the  port  of  Murmansk,  which 
receives  the  warm  currents  of  the  Gulf  Stream,  that  coast  is 
locked  in  ice  much  of  the  year.  Thirteen  seas  and  parts  of  three 
oceans — the  Arctic,  Atlantic,  and  Pacific — wash  Russian  shores. 

Administrative  and  Territorial  Divisions 

With  a  few  changes  of  status,  most  of  the  Soviet-era  adminis- 
trative and  territorial  divisions  of  the  Russian  Republic  were 
retained  in  constituting  the  Russian  Federation.  In  1996  there 
were  eighty-nine  administrative  territorial  divisions:  twenty-one 
republics,  six  territories  (kraya;  sing.,  kray),  forty-nine  oblasts 
(provinces),  one  autonomous  oblast,  and  ten  autonomous 
regions  (okruga;  sing.,  okrug).  The  cities  of  Moscow  and  St. 
Petersburg  have  separate  status  at  the  oblast  level.  Population 
size  and  location  have  been  the  determinants  for  a  region's 
designation  among  those  categories.  The  smallest  political  divi- 
sion is  the  rayon  (pi.,  rayony),  a  unit  roughly  equivalent  to  the 
county  in  the  United  States. 

The  republics  include  a  wide  variety  of  peoples,  including 
northern  Europeans,  Tatars,  Caucasus  peoples,  and  indigenous 
Siberians.  The  largest  administrative  territorial  divisions  are  in 
Siberia.  Located  in  east-central  Siberia,  the  Republic  of  Sakha, 
formerly  known  as  Yakutia,  is  the  largest  administrative  division 
in  the  federation,  twice  the  size  of  Alaska.  Second  in  size  is 
Krasnoyarsk  Territory,  which  is  southwest  of  Sakha  in  Siberia. 
Kaliningrad  Oblast,  which  is  somewhat  larger  than  Connecti- 
cut, is  the  smallest  oblast,  and  it  is  the  only  noncontiguous  part 
of  Russia.  The  two  most  populous  administrative  territorial 
divisions,  Moscow  Oblast  and  Krasnodar  Territory,  are  in  Euro- 
pean Russia. 

Topography  and  Drainage 

Geographers  traditionally  divide  the  vast  territory  of  Russia 
into  five  natural  zones:  the  tundra  zone;  the  taiga,  or  forest, 
zone;  the  steppe,  or  plains,  zone;  the  arid  zone;  and  the  moun-

tain  zone.  Most  of  Russia  consists  of  two  plains  (the  East  Euro- 
pean Plain  and  the  West  Siberian  Plain),  two  lowlands  (the 
North  Siberian  and  the  Kolyma,  in  far  northeastern  Siberia), 
two  plateaus  (the  Central  Siberian  Plateau  and  the  Lena  Pla- 
teau to  its  east) ,  and  a  series  of  mountainous  areas  mainly  con- 
centrated in  the  extreme  northeast  or  extending  intermittently 
along  the  southern  border. 

Topography 

The  East  European  Plain  encompasses  most  of  European 
Russia.  The  West  Siberian  Plain,  which  is  the  world's  largest, 
extends  east  from  the  Urals  to  the  Yenisey  River.  Because  the 
terrain  and  vegetation  are  relatively  uniform  in  each  of  the  nat- 
ural zones,  Russia  presents  an  illusion  of  uniformity.  Neverthe- 
less, Russian  territory  contains  all  the  major  vegetation  zones 
of  the  world  except  a  tropical  rain  forest. 

About  10  percent  of  Russia  is  tundra,  or  treeless,  marshy 
plain.  The  tundra  is  Russia's  northernmost  zone,  stretching 
from  the  Finnish  border  in  the  west  to  the  Bering  Strait  in  the 
east,  then  running  south  along  the  Pacific  coast  to  the  north- 
ern Kamchatka  Peninsula.  The  zone  is  known  for  its  herds  of 
wild  reindeer,  for  so-called  white  nights  (dusk  at  midnight, 
dawn  shortly  thereafter)  in  summer,  and  for  days  of  total  dark- 
ness in  winter.  The  long,  harsh  winters  and  lack  of  sunshine 
allow  only  mosses,  lichens,  and  dwarf  willows  and  shrubs  to 
sprout  low  above  the  barren  permafrost  (see  Glossary). 
Although  several  powerful  Siberian  rivers  traverse  this  zone  as 
they  flow  northward  to  the  Arctic  Ocean,  partial  and  intermit- 
tent thawing  hamper  drainage  of  the  numerous  lakes,  ponds, 
and  swamps  of  the  tundra.  Frost  weathering  is  the  most  impor- 
tant physical  process  here,  gradually  shaping  a  landscape  that 
was  severely  modified  by  glaciation  in  the  last  ice  age.  Less  than 
1  percent  of  Russia's  population  lives  in  this  zone.  The  fishing 
and  port  industries  of  the  northwestern  Kola  Peninsula  and  the 
huge  oil  and  gas  fields  of  northwestern  Siberia  are  the  largest 
employers  in  the  tundra.  With  a  population  of  180,000,  the 
industrial  frontier  city  of  Noril'sk  is  second  in  population  to 
Murmansk  among  Russia's  settlements  above  the  Arctic  Circle. 

The  taiga,  which  is  the  world's  largest  forest  region,  contains 
mostly  coniferous  spruce,  fir,  cedar,  and  larch.  This  is  the  larg- 
est natural  zone  of  the  Russian  Federation,  an  area  about  the 
size  of  the  United  States.  In  the  northeastern  portion  of  this 
belt,  long  and  severe  winters  frequently  bring  the  world's  cold- 


129 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

est  temperatures  for  inhabited  areas.  The  taiga  zone  extends  in 
a  broad  band  across  the  middle  latitudes,  stretching  from  the 
Finnish  border  in  the  west  to  the  Verkhoyansk  Range  in  north- 
eastern Siberia  and  as  far  south  as  the  southern  shores  of  Lake 
Baikal.  Isolated  sections  of  taiga  also  exist  along  mountain 
ranges  such  as  the  southern  part  of  the  Urals  and  in  the  Amur 
River  valley  bordering  China  in  the  Far  East.  About  33  percent 
of  Russia's  population  lives  in  this  zone,  which,  together  with  a 
band  of  mixed  forest  to  its  south,  includes  most  of  the  Euro- 
pean part  of  Russia  and  the  ancestral  lands  of  the  earliest  Slavic 
settlers. 

The  steppe  has  long  been  depicted  as  the  typical  Russian 
landscape.  It  is  a  broad  band  of  treeless,  grassy  plains,  inter- 
rupted by  mountain  ranges,  extending  from  Hungary  across 
Ukraine,  southern  Russia,  and  Kazakstan  before  ending  in 
Manchuria.  Most  of  the  Soviet  Union's  steppe  zone  was  located 
in  the  Ukrainian  and  Kazak  republics;  the  much  smaller  Rus- 
sian steppe  is  located  mainly  between  those  nations,  extending 
southward  between  the  Black  and  Caspian  seas  before  blend- 
ing into  the  increasingly  desiccated  territory  of  the  Republic  of 
Kalmykia.  In  a  country  of  extremes,  the  steppe  zone  provides 
the  most  favorable  conditions  for  human  settlement  and  agri- 
culture because  of  its  moderate  temperatures  and  normally 
adequate  levels  of  sunshine  and  moisture.  Even  here,  however, 
agricultural  yields  are  sometimes  adversely  affected  by  unpre- 
dictable levels  of  precipitation  and  occasional  catastrophic 
droughts. 

Russia's  mountain  ranges  are  located  principally  along  its 
continental  divide  (the  Urals),  along  the  southwestern  border 
(the  Caucasus),  along  the  border  with  Mongolia  (the  eastern 
and  western  Sayan  ranges  and  the  western  extremity  of  the 
Altay  Range),  and  in  eastern  Siberia  (a  complex  system  of 
ranges  in  the  northeastern  corner  of  the  country  and  forming 
the  spine  of  the  Kamchatka  Peninsula,  and  lesser  mountains 
extending  along  the  Sea  of  Okhotsk  and  the  Sea  of  Japan). 
Russia  has  nine  major  mountain  ranges.  In  general,  the  eastern 
half  of  the  country  is  much  more  mountainous  than  the  west- 
ern half,  the  interior  of  which  is  dominated  by  low  plains.  The 
traditional  dividing  line  between  the  east  and  the  west  is  the 
Yenisey  Valley.  In  delineating  the  western  edge  of  the  Central 
Siberian  Plateau  from  the  West  Siberian  Plain,  the  Yenisey  runs 
from  near  the  Mongolian  border  northward  into  the  Arctic 
Ocean  west  of  the  Taymyr  Peninsula.

Physical  Environment  and  Population 

The  Urals  are  the  most  famous  of  the  country's  mountain 
ranges  because  they  form  the  natural  boundary  between 
Europe  and  Asia  and  contain  valuable  mineral  deposits.  The 
range  extends  about  2,100  kilometers  from  the  Arctic  Ocean  to 
the  northern  border  of  Kazakstan.  In  terms  of  elevation  and 
vegetation,  however,  the  Urals  are  far  from  impressive,  and 
they  do  not  serve  as  a  formidable  natural  barrier.  Several  low 
passes  provide  major  transportation  routes  through  the  Urals 
eastward  from  Europe.  The  highest  peak,  Mount  Narodnaya,  is 
1,894  meters,  lower  than  the  highest  of  the  Appalachian  Moun- 
tains. 

To  the  east  of  the  Urals  is  the  West  Siberian  Plain,  which  cov- 
ers more  than  2.5  million  square  kilometers,  stretching  about 
1,900  kilometers  from  west  to  east  and  about  2,400  kilometers 
from  north  to  south.  With  more  than  half  its  territory  below 
500  meters  in  elevation,  the  plain  contains  some  of  the  world's 
largest  swamps  and  floodplains.  Most  of  the  plain's  population 
lives  in  the  drier  section  south  of  55°  north  latitude. 

The  region  directly  east  of  the  West  Siberian  Plain  is  the 
Central  Siberian  Plateau,  which  extends  eastward  from  the 
Yenisey  River  valley  to  the  Lena  River  valley.  The  region  is 
divided  into  several  plateaus,  with  elevations  ranging  between 
320  and  740  meters;  the  highest  elevation  is  about  1,800 
meters,  in  the  northern  Putoran  Mountains.  The  plain  is 
bounded  on  the  south  by  the  Baikal  mountain  system  and  on 
the  north  by  the  North  Siberian  Lowland,  an  extension  of  the 
West  Siberian  Plain  extending  into  the  Taymyr  Peninsula  on 
the  Arctic  Ocean. 

Truly  alpine  terrain  appears  in  the  southern  mountain 
ranges.  Between  the  Black  and  Caspian  seas,  the  Caucasus 
Mountains  rise  to  impressive  heights,  forming  a  boundary 
between  Europe  and  Asia.  One  of  the  peaks,  Mount  Elbrus,  is 
the  highest  point  in  Europe,  at  5,642  meters.  The  geological 
structure  of  the  Caucasus  extends  to  the  northwest  as  the 
Crimean  and  Carpathian  mountains  and  southeastward  into 
Central  Asia  as  the  Tian  Shan  and  Pamirs.  The  Caucasus  Moun- 
tains create  an  imposing  natural  barrier  between  Russia  and  its 
neighbors  to  the  southwest,  Georgia  and  Azerbaijan. 

In  the  mountain  system  west  of  Lake  Baikal  in  south-central 
Siberia,  the  highest  elevations  are  3,300  meters  in  the  Western 
Sayan,  3,200  meters  in  the  Eastern  Sayan,  and  4,500  meters  at 
Mount  Belukha  in  the  Altay  Range.  The  Eastern  Sayan  reach 
nearly  to  the  southern  shore  of  Lake  Baikal;  at  the  lake,  there  is 


131 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

an  elevation  difference  of  more  than  4,500  meters  between  the 
nearest  mountain,  2,840  meters  high,  and  the  deepest  part  of 
the  lake,  which  is  1,700  meters  below  sea  level.  The  mountain 
systems  east  of  Lake  Baikal  are  lower,  forming  a  complex  of 
minor  ranges  and  valleys  that  reaches  from  the  lake  to  the 
Pacific  coast.  The  maximum  height  of  the  Stanovoy  Range, 
which  runs  west  to  east  from  northern  Lake  Baikal  to  the  Sea  of 
Okhotsk,  is  2,550  meters.  To  the  south  of  that  range  is  south- 
eastern Siberia,  whose  mountains  reach  2,800  feet.  Across  the 
Tatar  Strait  from  that  region  is  Sakhalin  Island,  where  the  high- 
est elevation  is  about  1,700  meters. 

Northeastern  Siberia,  north  of  the  Stanovoy  Range,  is  an 
extremely  mountainous  region.  The  long  Kamchatka  Penin- 
sula, which  juts  southward  into  the  Sea  of  Okhotsk,  includes 
many  volcanic  peaks,  some  of  which  still  are  active.  The  highest 
is  the  4,750-meter  Klyuchevskaya  Volcano,  the  highest  point  in 
the  Russian  Far  East.  The  volcanic  chain  continues  from  the 
southern  tip  of  Kamchatka  southward  through  the  Kuril 
Islands  chain  and  into  Japan.  Kamchatka  also  is  one  of  Russia's 
two  centers  of  seismic  activity  (the  other  is  the  Caucasus).  In 
1994  a  major  earthquake  largely  destroyed  the  oil-processing 
city  of  Neftegorsk. 

Drainage 

Russia  is  a  water-rich  country.  The  earliest  settlements  in  the 
country  sprang  up  along  the  rivers,  where  most  of  the  urban 
population  continues  to  live.  The  Volga,  Europe's  longest  river, 
is  by  far  Russia's  most  important  commercial  waterway.  Four  of 
the  country's  thirteen  largest  cities  are  located  on  its  banks: 
Nizhniy  Novgorod,  Samara,  Kazan',  and  Volgograd.  The  Kama 
River,  which  flows  west  from  the  southern  Urals  to  join  the 
Volga  in  the  Republic  of  Tatarstan,  is  a  second  key  European 
water  system  whose  banks  are  densely  populated. 

Russia  has  thousands  of  rivers  and  inland  bodies  of  water, 
providing  it  with  one  of  the  world's  largest  surface-water 
resources.  However,  most  of  Russia's  rivers  and  streams  belong 
to  the  Arctic  drainage  basin,  which  lies  mainly  in  Siberia  but 
also  includes  part  of  European  Russia.  Altogether,  84  percent 
of  Russia's  surface  water  is  located  east  of  the  Urals  in  rivers 
flowing  through  sparsely  populated  territory  and  into  the  Arc- 
tic and  Pacific  oceans.  In  contrast,  areas  with  the  highest  con- 
centrations of  population,  and  therefore  the  highest  demand 
for  water  supplies,  tend  to  have  the  warmest  climates  and  high- 


132 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

est  rates  of  evaporation.  As  a  result,  densely  populated  areas 
such  as  the  Don  and  Kuban'  river  basins  north  of  the  Caucasus 
have  barely  adequate  (or  in  some  cases  inadequate)  water 
resources. 

Forty  of  Russia's  rivers  longer  than  1,000  kilometers  are  east 
of  the  Urals,  including  the  three  major  rivers  that  drain  Siberia 
as  they  flow  northward  to  the  Arctic  Ocean:  the  Irtysh-Ob'  sys- 
tem (totaling  5,380  kilometers),  the  Yenisey  (4,000  kilometers), 
and  the  Lena  (3,630  kilometers).  The  basins  of  those  river  sys- 
tems cover  about  8  million  square  kilometers,  discharging 
nearly  50,000  cubic  meters  of  water  per  second  into  the  Arctic 
Ocean.  The  northward  flow  of  these  rivers  means  that  source 
areas  thaw  before  the  areas  downstream,  creating  vast  swamps 
such  as  the  48,000-square-kilometer  Vasyugane  Swamp  in  the 
center  of  the  West  Siberian  Plain.  The  same  is  true  of  other 
river  systems,  including  the  Pechora  and  the  North  Dvina  in 
Europe  and  the  Kolyma  and  the  Indigirka  in  Siberia.  Approxi- 
mately 10  percent  of  Russian  territory  is  classified  as  swamp- 
land. 

A  number  of  other  rivers  drain  Siberia  from  eastern  moun- 
tain ranges  into  the  Pacific  Ocean.  The  Amur  River  and  its 
main  tributary,  the  Ussuri,  form  a  long  stretch  of  the  winding 
boundary  between  Russia  and  China.  The  Amur  system  drains 
most  of  southeastern  Siberia.  Three  basins  drain  European 
Russia.  The  Dnepr,  which  flows  mainly  through  Belarus  and 
Ukraine,  has  its  headwaters  in  the  hills  west  of  Moscow.  The 
1,860-kilometer  Don  originates  in  the  Central  Russian  Upland 
south  of  Moscow  and  then  flows  into  the  Sea  of  Azov  and  the 
Black  Sea  at  Rostov-na-Donu.  The  Volga  is  the  third  and  by  far 
the  largest  of  the  European  systems,  rising  in  the  Valday  Hills 
west  of  Moscow  and  meandering  southeastward  for  3,510  kilo- 
meters before  emptying  into  the  Caspian  Sea.  Altogether,  the 
Volga  system  drains  about  1.4  million  square  kilometers. 
Linked  by  several  canals,  European  Russia's  rivers  long  have 
been  a  vital  transportation  system;  the  Volga  system  still  carries 
two-thirds  of  Russia's  inland  water  traffic  (see  Transportation, 
ch.  6). 

Russia's  inland  bodies  of  water  are  chiefly  a  legacy  of  exten- 
sive glaciation.  In  European  Russia,  the  largest  lakes  are 
Ladoga  and  Onega  northeast  of  St.  Petersburg,  Lake  Peipus  on 
the  Estonian  border,  and  the  Rybinsk  Reservoir  north  of  Mos- 
cow Smaller  man-made  reservoirs,  160  to  320  kilometers  long, 
are  on  the  Don,  the  Kama,  and  the  Volga  rivers.  Many  large  res- 


133 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


ervoirs  also  have  been  constructed  on  the  Siberian  rivers;  the 
Bratsk  Reservoir  northwest  of  Lake  Baikal  is  one  of  the  world's 
largest. 

The  most  prominent  of  Russia's  bodies  of  fresh  water  is  Lake 
Baikal,  the  world's  deepest  and  most  capacious  freshwater  lake. 
Lake  Baikal  alone  holds  85  percent  of  the  freshwater  resources 
of  the  lakes  in  Russia  and  20  percent  of  the  world's  total.  It 
extends  632  kilometers  in  length  and  fifty-nine  kilometers 
across  at  its  widest  point.  Its  maximum  depth  is  1,713  meters. 
Numerous  smaller  lakes  dot  the  northern  regions  of  the  Euro- 
pean and  Siberian  plains.  The  largest  of  these  are  lakes  Beloye, 
Topozero,  Vyg,  and  Il'men'  in  the  European  northwest  and 
Lake  Chany  in  southwestern  Siberia. 

Climate 

Russia  has  a  largely  continental  climate  because  of  its  sheer 
size  and  compact  configuration.  Most  of  its  land  is  more  than 
400  kilometers  from  the  sea,  and  the  center  is  3,840  kilometers 
from  the  sea.  In  addition,  Russia's  mountain  ranges,  predomi- 
nantly to  the  south  and  the  east,  block  moderating  tempera- 
tures from  the  Indian  and  Pacific  oceans,  but  European  Russia 
and  northern  Siberia  lack  such  topographic  protection  from 
the  Arctic  and  North  Atlantic  oceans. 

Because  only  small  parts  of  Russia  are  south  of  50°  north  lati- 
tude and  more  than  half  of  the  country  is  north  of  60°  north 
latitude,  extensive  regions  experience  six  months  of  snow  cover 
over  subsoil  that  is  permanently  frozen  to  depths  as  far  as  sev- 
eral hundred  meters.  The  average  yearly  temperature  of  nearly 
all  of  European  Russia  is  below  freezing,  and  the  average  for 
most  of  Siberia  is  freezing  or  below.  Most  of  Russia  has  only  two 
seasons,  summer  and  winter,  with  very  short  intervals  of  moder- 
ation between  them.  Transportation  routes,  including  entire 
railroad  lines,  are  redirected  in  winter  to  traverse  rock-solid 
waterways  and  lakes.  Some  areas  constitute  important  excep- 
tions to  this  description,  however:  the  moderate  maritime  cli- 
mate of  Kaliningrad  Oblast  on  the  Baltic  Sea  is  similar  to  that 
of  the  American  Northwest;  the  Russian  Far  East,  under  the 
influence  of  the  Pacific  Ocean,  has  a  monsoonal  climate  that 
reverses  the  direction  of  wind  in  summer  and  winter,  sharply 
differentiating  temperatures;  and  a  narrow,  subtropical  band 
of  territory  provides  Russia's  most  popular  summer  resort  area 
on  the  Black  Sea.

In  winter  an  intense  high-pressure  system  causes  winds  to 
blow  from  the  south  and  the  southwest  in  all  but  the  Pacific 
region  of  the  Russian  landmass;  in  summer  a  low-pressure  sys- 
tem brings  winds  from  the  north  and  the  northwest  to  most  of 
the  landmass.  That  meteorological  combination  reduces  the 
wintertime  temperature  difference  between  north  and  south. 
Thus,  average  January  temperatures  are  -8°C  in  St.  Petersburg, 
-27°C  in  the  West  Siberian  Plain,  and  -43°C  at  Yakutsk  (in  east- 
central  Siberia,  at  approximately  the  same  latitude  as  St.  Peters- 
burg), while  the  winter  average  on  the  Mongolian  border, 
whose  latitude  is  some  10°  farther  south,  is  barely  warmer.  Sum- 
mer temperatures  are  more  affected  by  latitude,  however;  the 
Arctic  islands  average  4°C,  and  the  southernmost  regions  aver- 
age 20°C.  Russia's  potential  for  temperature  extremes  is  typi- 
fied by  the  national  record  low  of  -94°C,  recorded  at 
Verkhoyansk  in  north-central  Siberia  and  the  record  high  of 
38°C,  recorded  at  several  southern  stations. 

The  long,  cold  winter  has  a  profound  impact  on  almost 
every  aspect  of  life  in  the  Russian  Federation.  It  affects  where 
and  how  long  people  live  and  work,  what  kinds  of  crops  are 
grown,  and  where  they  are  grown  (no  part  of  the  country  has  a 
year-round  growing  season).  The  length  and  severity  of  the 
winter,  together  with  the  sharp  fluctuations  in  the  mean  sum- 


135 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

mer  and  winter  temperatures,  impose  special  requirements  on 
many  branches  of  the  economy.  In  regions  of  permafrost, 
buildings  must  be  constructed  on  pilings,  machinery  must  be 
made  of  specially  tempered  steel,  and  transportation  systems 
must  be  engineered  to  perform  reliably  in  extremely  low  and 
extremely  high  temperatures.  In  addition,  during  extended 
periods  of  darkness  and  cold,  there  are  increased  demands  for 
energy,  health  care,  and  textiles. 

Because  Russia  has  little  exposure  to  ocean  influences,  most 
of  the  country  receives  low  to  moderate  amounts  of  precipita- 
tion. Highest  precipitation  falls  in  the  northwest,  with  amounts 
decreasing  from  northwest  to  southeast  across  European  Rus- 
sia. The  wettest  areas  are  the  small,  lush  subtropical  region 
adjacent  to  the  Caucasus  and  along  the  Pacific  coast.  Along  the 
Baltic  coast,  average  annual  precipitation  is  600  millimeters, 
and  in  Moscow  it  is  525  millimeters.  An  average  of  only  twenty 
millimeters  falls  along  the  Russian-Kazak  border,  and  as  little  as 
fifteen  millimeters  may  fall  along  Siberia's  Arctic  coastline. 
Average  annual  days  of  snow  cover,  a  critical  factor  for  agricul- 
ture, depends  on  both  latitude  and  altitude.  Cover  varies  from 
forty  to  200  days  in  European  Russia,  and  from  120  to  250  days 
in  Siberia. 

Environmental  Problems 

With  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  Moscow  and 
the  Russian  Federation  escaped  direct  responsibility  for  some 
of  the  world's  worst  environmental  devastation  because  many 
of  the  Soviet  disaster  sites  were  now  in  other  countries.  Since 
then,  however,  the  gravity  and  complexity  of  threats  to  Russia's 
own  environment  have  become  clear.  During  the  first  years  of 
transition  and  reform,  Russia's  response  to  those  conditions 
was  sporadic  and  often  ineffectual. 

Only  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  was  a  linkage  identi- 
fied between  the  increasingly  poor  state  of  human  health  and 
the  destruction  of  ecosystems  in  Russia.  When  that  linkage  was 
established,  a  new  word  was  coined  to  sum  up  the  environmen- 
tal record  of  the  Soviet  era — "ecocide." 

Environmental  Conditions 

In  the  Soviet  system,  environmentally  threatening  incidents 
such  as  the  bursting  of  an  oil  pipeline  received  little  or  no  pub- 
lic notice,  and  remedial  actions  were  slow  or  nonexistent.  Gov-

ernment  officials  felt  that  natural  resources  were  abundant 
enough  to  afford  waste,  that  the  land  could  easily  absorb  any 
level  of  pollution,  and  that  stringent  control  measures  were  an 
unjustifiable  hindrance  to  economic  advancement.  In  the 
1990s,  after  decades  of  such  practices,  the  government  catego- 
rized about  40  percent  of  Russia's  territory  (an  area  about 
three-quarters  as  large  as  the  United  States)  as  under  high  or 
moderately  high  ecological  stress.  Excluding  areas  of  radiation 
contamination,  fifty-six  areas  have  been  identified  as  environ- 
mentally degraded  regions,  ranging  from  full-fledged  ecologi- 
cal disaster  areas  to  moderately  polluted  areas. 

Major  Crises 

Dangerous  environmental  conditions  came  to  the  attention 
of  the  public  in  the  Soviet  Union  under  the  glasnost  policy  of 
the  regime  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in  office  1985-91),  which 
liberated  the  exchange  of  information  in  the  late  1980s.  The 
three  situations  that  gripped  public  attention  were  the  April 
1986  nuclear  explosion  at  the  Chernobyl1  Nuclear  Power  Sta- 
tion in  Ukraine,  the  long-term  and  ongoing  desiccation  of  the 
Aral  Sea  between  Uzbekistan  and  Kazakstan,  and  the  irradia- 
tion of  northern  Kazakstan  by  the  Semipalatinsk  (present-day 
Semey)  nuclear  testing  site.  The  overall  cost  of  rectifying  these 
three  disasters  is  staggering,  dwarfing  the  cost  of  cleanups  else- 
where, such  as  the  superfund  campaign  to  eliminate  toxic 
waste  sites  in  the  United  States.  By  the  time  the  Soviet  Union 
dissolved  in  1991,  such  conditions  had  become  symbols  of  that 
system's  disregard  for  the  quality  of  the  environment. 

Since  1990  Russian  experts  have  added  to  the  list  the  follow- 
ing less  spectacular  but  equally  threatening  environmental  cri- 
ses: the  Dnepropetrovsk-Donets  and  Kuznets  coal-mining  and 
metallurgical  centers,  which  have  severely  polluted  air  and 
water  and  vast  areas  of  decimated  landscape;  the  Urals  indus- 
trial region,  a  strip  of  manufacturing  cities  that  follows  the 
southern  Urals  from  Perm'  in  the  north  to  Magnitogorsk  near 
the  Kazak  border  (an  area  with  severe  air  and  water  pollution 
as  well  as  radioactive  contamination  near  the  city  of  Kyshtym); 
the  Kola  Peninsula  in  the  far  northwest,  where  nonferrous  min- 
ing and  metallurgical  operations,  centered  on  the  region's 
nickel  reserves,  have  created  air  pollution  that  drifts  westward 
across  northern  Scandinavia;  the  Republic  of  Kalmykia,  where 
faulty  agricultural  practices  have  produced  soil  erosion,  deserti- 
fication, and  chemical  contamination;  and  the  Moscow  area, 


137 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

which  suffers  from  high  levels  of  industrial  and  vehicular  air 
pollution  and  improper  disposal  of  low-level  radioactive  waste. 
The  experts  also  named  five  areas  of  severe  water  pollution:  the 
Black  Sea,  the  Caspian  Sea,  the  Sea  of  Azov  north  of  the  Black 
Sea,  the  Volga  River,  and  Lake  Baikal. 

Each  of  Russia's  natural  zones  has  suffered  degradation  of 
specific  kinds.  In  the  tundra,  the  greatest  damage  stems  from 
extraction  and  transportation  of  mineral  resources  by  crude 
techniques.  In  delicate  tundra  habitats,  oil  spills,  leaks  in  natu- 
ral gas  pipelines,  and  the  flaring  of  natural  gas  destroy  north- 
ern marshland  ecosystems,  which  take  many  years  to  purify 
naturally.  Also  endangered  are  reindeer  grazing  lands,  upon 
which  indigenous  peoples  traditionally  have  depended  for 
their  livelihood.  In  the  permafrost  zones  that  constitute  about 
40  percent  of  Russia's  territory,  lower  air,  water,  and  ground 
temperatures  slow  natural  self-cleansing  processes  that  mitigate 
contamination  in  warmer  regions,  magnifying  the  impact  of 
every  spill  and  leak. 

In  the  taiga,  or  forest,  zone,  the  overcutting  of  trees  poses 
the  greatest  threat,  particularly  in  northern  European  Russia, 
the  Urals,  and  the  Angara  Basin  in  south-central  Siberia. 
Uncontrolled  mining  operations  constitute  the  second  major 
source  of  damage  in  the  taiga.  In  the  broad-leafed  forest  zone, 
irrational  land  use  has  caused  soil  erosion  on  a  huge  scale. 
Urbanization  and  air  and  water  pollution  also  are  problems. 

The  forest-steppe  and  steppe  regions  are  subjected  to  soil 
exhaustion,  loss  of  humus,  soil  compacting,  and  erosion,  creat- 
ing an  extremely  serious  ecological  situation.  The  soil  fertility 
of  Russia's  celebrated  black-earth  (chernozem — see  Glossary) 
region  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  the  postwar  period. 
Overgrazing  is  the  main  problem  in  the  pasturage  regions  of 
the  Russian  steppe  and  has  severely  affected  the  Republic  of 
Kalmykia  in  southwestern  Russia  and  the  region  east  of  Lake 
Baikal.  In  Russia's  limited  semiarid  and  arid  territories,  poorly 
designed  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  have  caused  saliniza- 
tion,  pollution,  and  contamination  of  surface  and  under- 
ground water,  but  not  to  the  degree  that  these  problems  exist 
in  Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Kazakstan. 

Air  Quality 

Although  reductions  in  industrial  production  caused  air 
quality  indexes  to  improve  somewhat  in  the  1990s,  Russia's  air 
still  rates  among  the  most  polluted  in  the  world.  According  to 


138 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

one  estimate,  only  15  percent  of  the  urban  population  breathes 
air  that  is  not  harmful.  Experts  fear  that  a  return  to  full  indus- 
trial production  will  mean  even  more  dangerous  levels  of  air 
pollution  given  Russia's  current  inefficient  pollution  control 
technology.  Of  the  43.8  million  tons  of  pollutants  discharged 
into  the  open  air  in  1993,  about  18,000  industrial  enterprises 
generated  an  estimated  24.8  million  tons.  Vehicle  emissions 
added  19  million  tons 

In  the  early  1990s,  Russia's  Hydrometeorological  Service, 
which  monitors  air  quality,  reported  that  231  out  of  292  cities 
exceeded  maximum  permissible  concentrations  (MPCs)  for 
particulate  matter,  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides,  or  carbon 
monoxide.  Pollution  levels  in  eighty-six  cities  exceeded  MPCs 
by  a  factor  of  ten.  The  most  polluted  cities  are  centers  of  heavy 
industry  (ferrous  and  nonferrous  metallurgy,  petroleum  refin- 
ing, chemicals,  and  pulp  production).  Not  surprisingly,  the 
largest  industrial  cities  head  the  list.  In  European  Russia,  these 
are  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg;  the  Ural  manufacturing  cen- 
ters of  Yekaterinburg,  Nizhniy  Tagil,  Magnitogorsk,  and  Ufa; 
and  Astrakhan',  Samara,  and  Volgograd  on  the  lower  Volga.  In 
Asian  Russia,  the  heaviest  air  pollution  is  in  Omsk  and 
Novokuznetsk  in  southwestern  Siberia,  Irkutsk  on  Lake  Baikal, 
the  Noril'sk  industrial  center  in  northwestern  Siberia,  and  Kha- 
barovsk in  the  Far  East.  Levels  of  airborne  sulfur,  nitrogen,  and 
lead  remain  high. 

Most  vehicles  in  Russia  continue  to  burn  leaded  fuel.  In  the 
early  1990s,  motor  vehicles  contributed  about  one-third  of  total 
hazardous  emissions  in  urban  and  industrial  areas.  Through- 
out the  Soviet  period  and  into  the  1990s,  trucks  were  the  great- 
est vehicular  polluters  because  privately  owned  vehicles  were 
relatively  scarce.  As  Russia  adopts  the  culture  of  the  privately 
owned  vehicle,  however,  it  is  likely  that  transportation  will 
increase  its  share  of  total  emissions. 

Water  Quality 

Soviet  leaders  took  little  action  to  protect  the  nation's  inland 
bodies  of  water  or  surrounding  oceans  and  seas  from  pollution, 
and  Soviet  planners  gave  low  priority  to  risk-free  treatment  and 
transport  of  water.  As  a  result,  75  percent  of  Russia's  surface 
water  is  now  polluted,  50  percent  of  all  water  is  not  potable 
according  to  quality  standards  established  in  1992,  and  an  esti- 
mated 30  percent  of  groundwater  available  for  use  is  highly 
polluted.  The  most  serious  water  pollution  conditions  relative 


139 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

to  demand  and  availability  of  clean  water  are  in  the  industrial 
regions  of  Krasnodar  and  Stavropol'  territories  north  of  the 
Caucasus,  Rostov  and  Novosibirsk  oblasts,  the  Republic  of 
Chechnya,  and  the  city  of  Moscow.  In  Krasnodar  and 
Stavropol',  inherent  water  shortages  exacerbate  the  situation. 

The  quality  of  drinking  water  is  a  major  concern.  Poor  water 
management  standards  have  raised  health  concerns  in  many 
cities,  and  water  safety  also  is  doubtful  in  the  countryside, 
where  59  percent  of  the  population  draws  water  from  common 
wells  affected  by  groundwater  pollution.  Unsanitary  runoff 
from  populated  places  and  agricultural  sites  contributes  heavily 
to  pollution  of  sources  that  ultimately  provide  water  for  domes- 
tic use;  the  quality  of  drinking  water  declines  noticeably  during 
spring  floods,  when  such  runoff  is  heaviest.  Rudimentary  por- 
table filters  are  not  widely  available.  An  estimated  8  percent  of 
wastewater  is  fully  treated  prior  to  dumping  in  waterways;  most 
water  treatment  facilities  are  obsolete,  inefficient,  and  gener- 
ally overwhelmed  by  the  volume  of  material  that  now  passes 
through  them,  but  funding  is  not  available  to  replace  them. 

In  recent  years,  officials  have  identified  many  of  Russia's  riv- 
ers as  carriers  of  waterborne  diseases,  epidemics  of  which  were 
especially  frequent  in  1995.  In  July  1995,  Moscow  city  health 
officials  reported  an  outbreak  of  cholera-causing  bacteria  in 
the  Moscow  River.  Officials  have  warned  of  increasing  out- 
breaks of  sewage-related  diseases — including  cholera,  salmo- 
nella, typhoid  fever,  dysentery,  and  viral  hepatitis — in  many 
other  Russian  rivers.  Citizens  have  been  instructed  to  boil  all 
water  before  use.  In  some  areas,  clean  water  is  so  scarce  that 
water  is  imported  from  other  regions.  The  highest  consump- 
tion of  imported  water  is  in  the  republics  of  Sakha  (Yakutia) 
and  Kalmykia,  Kamchatka  and  Magadan  oblasts  in  the  Far  East, 
and  Stavropol'  Territory. 

Among  the  chemicals  and  contaminants  dumped  frequently 
and  indiscriminately  have  been  compounds  containing  heavy 
metals,  phenols,  pesticides,  and  pathogenic  bacteria.  Chemical 
pollution  was  dramatized  when  fires  ignited  spontaneously  on 
the  Iset'  River  in  Sverdlovsk  (present-day  Yekaterinburg)  in 
1965  and  on  the  Volga  River  in  1970.  Russian  agriculture,  like 
industry  subject  to  centralized  control  and  quota  fulfillment  in 
the  Soviet  era,  continues  to  cause  severe  water  pollution  by 
overuse  and  improper  handling  and  storage  of  toxic  chemical 
fertilizers,  herbicides,  and  pesticides.  During  the  Soviet  era, 
dioxin,  a  carcinogen,  was  used  routinely  as  an  agricultural 


140

atmosphere,  Khabarovsk

insecticide,  and  it  heavily  tainted  rural  wells.  In  1990  Soviet 
authorities  declared  that  dioxin,  which  enters  the  body 
through  drinking  water,  was  the  most  serious  health  threat 
from  pollution. 

In  1992  the  Russian  Federation's  Committee  on  Fishing 
reported  994  cases  in  which  bodies  of  water  were  "completely 
contaminated"  by  agricultural  runoff.  Runoff  from  fields 
results  in  fish  kills  and  groundwater  contamination.  Among  the 
largest  river  systems  in  European  Russia,  the  Volga  and  Dnepr 
rivers  suffer  from  acute  eutrophication — depletion  of  dissolved 
oxygen  by  overnutrition  of  aquatic  plant  life — which  distorts 
natural  life  cycles.  Large-scale  fish  kills  have  occurred  in  the 
Kama,  Kuban',  North  Dvina,  Oka,  and  Ural  rivers. 

Pollution  in  the  Gulf  of  Finland,  the  easternmost  extension 
of  the  Baltic  Sea,  includes  untreated  sewage  from  St.  Peters- 


141

burg,  where  heavy  metals  and  other  chemical  substances  are 
not  properly  removed  prior  to  dumping.  In  late  1995,  St. 
Petersburg  city  officials  signed  an  agreement  with  a  French 
water  purification  company  to  process  the  city's  drinking  water; 
the  Finns  hope  that  such  a  move  also  will  improve  the  overall 
quality  of  the  city's  effluent  water. 

Water  quality  in  Lake  Ladoga,  Europe's  largest  freshwater 
lake,  came  to  the  attention  of  government  authorities  in  the 
mid-1990s.  Factories  on  the  lake,  which  is  just  east  of  St.  Peters- 
burg, have  discharged  tons  of  heavy  metals  and  other  toxic  sub- 
stances into  local  rivers.  The  shores  of  Lake  Ladoga  and  Lake 
Onega  to  its  east  have  been  storage  sites  for  fertilizers,  livestock 
waste,  and  chemicals  as  well  as  for  radioactive  military  waste. 
When  local  rivers  emanating  from  the  lakes  reach  the  Gulf  of 
Finland,  their  chemical  burden  changes  the  oxygen  balance  in 
the  gulf.  Similar  situations  affect  the  Arctic  Ocean,  into  which 
Siberian  rivers  flow  after  passing  through  numerous  industrial 
and  power-generating  centers,  and  the  Baltic  Sea,  into  which 
large  amounts  of  military  waste  and  chemical  weapons  were 
discarded  from  Poland  and  the  Baltic  republics  during  the 
Soviet  era. 

Marine  biologists  report  that  only  five  species  of  fish  remain 
in  the  Black  Sea,  which  once  was  a  highly  diverse  marine  eco- 
system with  twenty-six  species.  Between  1985  and  1994,  the 
total  fish  catch  in  the  Black  Sea  dropped  from  675,000  to 
45,000  kilograms.  According  to  environmentalists,  the  entire 
sea  is  in  danger  of  "dying"  because  only  about  10  percent  of  its 
near-surface  volume  contains  enough  oxygen  to  support  life. 
Deoxygenation  is  caused  primarily  by  large-scale  infusions  of 
hydrogen  sulfide,  which  comes  mainly  from  the  Danube,  Don, 
South  Bug,  and  Dnepr  rivers  that  flow  into  the  sea  from  the 
north  and  the  west.  Large  amounts  of  mercury,  cadmium, 
arsenic,  and  oil  have  been  identified  as  well.  In  1992  the  littoral 
states  of  Bulgaria,  Georgia,  Romania,  Russia,  Turkey,  and 
Ukraine  signed  an  agreement  to  take  specific  measures  against 
pollution  of  the  Black  Sea  and  the  tributary  rivers  that  flow 
through  their  territory.  Conflicting  goals  and  positions  among 
the  states  involved,  however,  have  hindered  environmental 
cooperation. 

The  Caspian  Sea  is  also  beset  with  chemical  pollution  and 
the  loss  of  indigenous  species,  and  it  now  faces  the  danger  that 
1  million  hectares  of  its  coastline,  including  Russia's  Volga 
River  delta,  will  be  flooded.  According  to  a  1996  report, 


142

800,000  hectares  in  Dagestan  already  had  been  inundated.  By 
1993  the  average  water  level  of  the  sea  had  risen  by  more  than 
two  meters.  Scientists  blame  the  rise  on  the  1977  Soviet  dam- 
ming of  the  Garabogaz  Gulf  on  the  Caspian  coast  of  Turkmeni- 
stan. Previously,  the  waters  of  the  gulf  intermixed  with  those  of 
the  Caspian,  acting  as  the  main  thermal  regulator  and  volume 
stabilizer  of  the  larger  body.  In  1996  the  Russian  government 
allocated  US$38  million  for  Caspian  Sea  conservation,  to  be 
matched  by  US$34  million  from  local  budgets. 

Water  quality  problems  are  most  severe  in  European  Russia, 
especially  in  the  Volga  Basin,  where  about  60  million  people 
live.  Of  all  water  withdrawn  from  natural  sources  in  Russia,  33 
percent  comes  from  the  Volga.  About  half  of  that  water  returns 
to  the  Volga  as  polluted  discharge,  accounting  for  37  percent 
of  the  total  volume  of  such  material  generated  in  Russia.  The 
Volga's  water  does  not  meet  the  norms  for  drinking  water  and 


143 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

is  unsuitable  for  fish  farming  or  irrigation.  In  the  late  1980s 
and  early  1990s,  numerous  government  committees  were 
formed  to  clean  up  the  Volga.  Few  of  the  resulting  restorative 
programs  have  been  implemented,  however,  and  the  Volga 
remains  under  ecological  stress. 

Lake  Baikal,  a  water  resource  of  world  importance  located  in 
south-central  Siberia,  long  was  the  focal  point  of  Soviet  envi- 
ronmental efforts  to  end  the  pollution  that  the  pulp  and  paper 
plants  caused  in  the  lake's  watershed.  A  series  of  comprehen- 
sive Soviet  and  post-Soviet  plans  yielded  limited  success  in  pro- 
tecting the  lake's  water  and  shoreline,  which  gradually  have 
succumbed  to  chemical  stresses.  In  1995  the  World  Bank  (see 
Glossary)  and  the  European  Union  (EU — see  Glossary) 
granted  funds  for  cleaning  up  Lake  Baikal,  and  in  1996  the 
Gore-Chernomyrdin  Commission  announced  United  States 
plans  to  aid  Russia  in  overhauling  paper  plants  in  the  Baikal 
region  (see  The  United  States,  ch.  8). 

Soil  and  Forests 

Russia  devotes  about  10  percent  of  its  land  to  agriculture, 
but  land  quality  is  declining.  Erosion  carries  away  as  much  as 
1.5  billion  tons  of  topsoil  every  year  (see  Agriculture,  ch.  6).  In 
the  past  twenty-five  years,  Russia's  arable  land  area  has 
decreased  by  an  estimated  33  million  hectares,  with  much  of 
that  loss  attributable  to  poor  land  management.  Experts  fear 
that  agricultural  land  management  may  deteriorate  further 
under  Russia's  new  land  privatization  as  individual  farmers  try 
to  squeeze  short-term  profit  from  their  new  property.  In  the 
early  1990s,  an  estimated  50  percent  of  arable  land  needed 
remediation  and  improved  management  for  agricultural  pro- 
ductivity to  improve.  Russia's  southern  regions,  especially  the 
Republic  of  Kalmykia,  are  losing  about  6,400  hectares  of  agri- 
cultural land  yearly  to  desertification.  To  the  east,  desiccation 
of  the  Aral  Sea  and  expansion  of  the  Qizilqum  Desert  in  Kazak- 
stan  have  a  climatic  drying  effect  that  exacerbates  desertifica- 
tion in  Russia  to  the  north  and  west. 

In  Russia  an  estimated  74  million  hectares  of  agricultural 
land  have  been  contaminated  by  industrial  toxic  agents,  pesti- 
cides, and  agricultural  chemicals.  Considerable  land  also  is  lost 
in  the  extraction  of  mineral  resources.  Unauthorized  dumping 
of  hazardous  industrial,  chemical,  and  household  waste  takes 
land  out  of  production.  Flooding  is  a  problem  near  the  Cas- 


144

pian  Sea  and  in  Stavropol'  Territory,  where  the  construction  of 
reservoirs  has  removed  land  from  use. 

In  1994  about  22  percent  of  the  world's  forests  and  50  per- 
cent of  its  coniferous  forests  were  in  Russia,  covering  an  area 
larger  than  the  continental  United  States.  Of  the  764  million 
hectares  of  forested  area,  78  percent  was  in  Siberia  and  the  Far 
East.  At  that  time,  vast  stands  of  Siberian  forest  remained 
untouched.  Such  broad  expanses  have  an  important  role  in  the 
global  carbon  cycle  and  in  biodiversity.  In  the  1990s,  the  atmo- 
sphere of  economic  stress  and  political  decentralization  has  the 
potential  to  accelerate  drastically  Russia's  rate  of  deforestation 
and  land  degradation,  especially  in  remote  areas.  Environmen- 
talists fear  that  timber  sales  will  be  used  as  a  short-term  stimu- 
lus to  regional  economies;  already,  Chinese,  Mongolian,  and 


145 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

North  and  South  Korean  companies  have  taken  advantage  of 
looser  restrictions  and  the  critical  need  for  hard  currency  (see 
Glossary)  to  begin  clear-cutting  Siberian  forests.  Timber  har- 
vesting by  Russian  firms  decreased  dramatically  in  the  1990s, 
from  375  million  cubic  meters  in  1989  to  110  million  cubic 
meters  in  1996. 

Aleksey  Yablokov,  head  of  the  nongovernmental  Center  for 
Russian  Environmental  Policy,  has  estimated  that  Siberia  is  los- 
ing 16  million  hectares  of  forest  annually  to  cutting,  pollution, 
and  fires — an  amount  six  times  the  official  government  esti- 
mate and  higher  than  the  rate  of  loss  in  the  Amazon  rain  for- 
ests. Fires,  which  normally  improve  biodiversity  and  long-term 
stability,  cause  excessive  damage  because  of  poor  fire  control 
measures.  Large  tracts  of  Russian  forest,  most  notably  136,000 
hectares  in  the  vicinity  of  Chernobyl1,  have  suffered  radioactive 
contamination,  which  also  increases  the  likelihood  of  forest 
fires.  Because  forests  cannot  be  decontaminated,  the  distribu- 
tion of  radioactive  particles  in  the  trees  remains  constant  over 
many  years. 

Inefficient  lumbering  procedures  cause  unnecessary  loss  of 
timber;  as  much  as  40  percent  of  Russia's  harvested  trees  never 
go  to  the  mill,  and  unsystematic  clear-cutting  prevents  produc- 
tive regrowth.  Forest  management  has  improved  gradually  in 
the  post-Soviet  era.  In  1993  the  Supreme  Soviet,  then  the  lower 
house  of  Russia's  parliament,  passed  the  Principles  of  the  For- 
est, national  laws  that  include  guidelines  for  management  and 
protection.  Because  implementation  of  these  laws  has  been 
quite  slow,  many  regional  jurisdictions  have  adopted  their  own 
management  standards. 

Acid  rain  from  European  and  Siberian  industrial  centers 
and  from  power  generation  plants  has  reduced  the  Siberian 
forests  by  an  estimated  730,000  hectares.  Hydroelectric  dams 
on  Siberian  rivers  raise  significantly  the  temperature  of  air  and 
water,  destabilizing  the  growing  conditions  of  adjacent  forests. 
Because  of  the  enormous  oxygen  production  and  carbon  diox- 
ide absorption  of  the  Russian  forests  (a  capacity  estimated  to  be 
second  only  to  that  of  the  Amazon  rain  forest),  removal  of 
large  sections  of  those  forests  would  have  a  drastic  effect  on  the 
quality  of  land  in  Russia  and  the  quality  of  air  over  the  entire 
world. 

Radioactive  Contamination 

Beginning  with  glasnost  in  the  mid-1980s  and  continuing 


146 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

with  the  establishment  of  an  independent  Russia  in  1991, 
much  disturbing  information  has  become  available  about 
Soviet  and  Russian  nuclear  practices  and  mishaps.  These  dis- 
closures have  included  deadly  accidents  on  land  and  aboard 
naval  vessels,  a  network  of  secret  cities  designed  specifically  for 
nuclear  weapons  production  and  material  processing,  detona- 
tion of  nuclear  blasts  for  "peaceful"  purposes,  and  the  dump- 
ing of  nuclear  waste  at  sea  and  its  injection  into  subterranean 
cavities. 

More  than  any  other  event,  the  Chernobyl1  disaster 
prompted  greater  scrutiny  and  candor  about  Soviet  nuclear 
programs.  Although  much  of  the  contamination  from  Cherno- 
byl' occurred  in  the  now-independent  countries  of  Ukraine 
and  Belarus,  the  present-day  Russian  Federation  also  received 
significant  fallout  from  the  accident.  Approximately  50,000 
square  kilometers  of  the  then  Russian  Republic,  particularly 
the  oblasts  of  Bryansk,  Orel,  Kaluga,  and  Tula,  were  contami- 
nated with  cesium-137  (see  table  3,  Appendix).  The  total  popu- 
lation of  the  nineteen  oblasts  and  republics  receiving  fallout 
from  Chernobyl'  was  37  million  in  1993. 

The  Soviet,  now  Russian,  navy's  disposal  and  accidental  vent- 
ing of  radioactive  materials  pose  particular  problems.  Begin- 
ning in  1965,  twenty  nuclear  reactors,  most  with  their  fuel  rods 
still  inside,  were  dumped  from  nuclear  submarines  and  an  ice- 
breaker into  the  Arctic  Ocean  north  of  Russia.  In  1994  the 
Oslo-based  Bellona  Foundation  estimated  that  radioactive 
dumping  in  the  Kara  Sea  north  of  western  Siberia  and  adjacent 
waters  constituted  two-thirds  of  all  the  radioactive  materials 
that  ever  have  entered  the  world's  oceans.  In  1996  Bellona 
identified  fifty-two  decommissioned  Russian  nuclear  subma- 
rines that  were  scheduled  for  scrapping  but  were  still  afloat 
near  Murmansk  with  nuclear  fuel  on  board;  a  timetable  for  dis- 
mantling them  has  fallen  far  behind. 

Japan  has  been  engaged  in  a  long  struggle  to  stop  Russia's 
Pacific  Fleet  from  dumping  radioactive  waste  into  the  Sea  of 
Japan  (see  Japan,  ch.  8).  In  1994  Russia  complied  with  Japan's 
demand  to  cease  dumping  entirely;  after  a  long  series  of  nego- 
tiations, in  January  1996  Russia  and  Japan  agreed  on  construc- 
tion of  a  floating  nuclear  waste  recycling  plant  and  expansion 
of  an  existing  facility  to  process  nuclear  waste  generated  by  the 
Pacific  Fleet.  The  United  States  and  Japan  are  to  fund  the  first 
project,  and  the  United  States  and  Norway  the  second.  In  the 
mid-1990s,  Russia  still  was  seeking  methods  of  storing  and  dis-

posing  of  first-generation  radioactive  waste  in  many  regions, 
including  the  European  Arctic.  Under  these  conditions, 
experts  predict  that  the  country  will  be  hard-pressed  to  comply 
with  the  requirements  of  the  arms  reduction  agreements  for 
disposal  of  waste  from  thousands  of  nuclear  weapons  sched- 
uled for  destruction  later  in  the  1990s  (see  Nuclear  Arms 
Issues,  ch.  9).  On  the  eve  of  the  Group  of  Seven  (G— 7;  see  Glos- 
sary) nuclear  safety  summit  meeting  in  Moscow  in  April  1996, 
Aleksey  Yablokov  and  the  Bellona  Foundation  complained  that 
continued  operation  of  Chernobyl'-type  reactors  presented  an 
unacceptable  risk  to  the  Russian  public.  The  Western  leaders  at 
the  G-7  meeting  generally  muted  their  criticism  on  the  issue  to 
avoid  embarrassing  President  Boris  N.  Yeltsin  during  his  presi- 
dential campaign.  Yablokov  announced  the  formation  of  a  new 
lobby  of  Russian  nongovernmental  organizations  for  greater 
government  disclosure  on  the  issue. 

The  Response  to  Environmental  Problems 

In  the  half-decade  that  began  with  the  Chernobyl'  disaster 
and  culminated  in  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  substan- 
tial changes  took  place  in  the  public's  attitudes  toward  environ- 
mental crises.  The  public  engaged  in  unprecedented 
discussion  about  the  dangers  the  state's  environmental  policies 
posed  to  public  health.  According  to  surveys,  the  public's  main 
concerns  were  local  problems  having  immediate  impact,  such 
as  polluted  water  supplies,  violation  of  public  health  regula- 
tions, and  air  pollution.  Russians  were  much  less  interested  in 
more  general  and  fundamental  issues  such  as  loss  of  biodiver- 
sity, deforestation,  and  acid  rain.  In  1989  a  national  poll  placed 
environmental  pollution  fifth  among  citizens'  major  concerns, 
but  only  one-third  of  respondents  expressed  their  willingness 
to  sacrifice  economically  to  improve  the  situation.  Neverthe- 
less, a  substantial  green  movement  arose  in  the  late  1980s. 
Fragmented  by  disagreement  over  politicization  and  national 
versus  local  agendas,  parts  of  the  movement  branched  into 
other  areas  of  activism  such  as  human  rights  and  regional 
autonomy,  and  no  single  green  party  emerged. 

Public  enthusiasm  for  environmental  improvement  followed 
the  same  curve  as  enthusiasm  for  democratic  and  economic 
reform;  by  1992  economic  hardship  began  to  wilt  the  zeal  for 
reform,  and  the  vast  majority  of  Russians  remained  skeptical  of 
political  change  throughout  the  early  1990s.  As  worsening  eco- 
nomic conditions  heightened  short-term  insecurity,  issues  such 


148 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

as  environmental  protection  paled,  especially  in  cases  where 
the  shutting  of  a  polluting  plant  threatened  the  livelihood  of  a 
town  or  city. 

Politicians  and  government  policy  generally  followed  the 
same  pattern  as  citizen  concern  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s.  In 
1988  the  initial  groundswell  of  environmental  concern  stimu- 
lated the  Gorbachev  government  to  form  the  State  Committee 
for  the  Protection  of  Nature  (Gosudarstvennyy  komitet  po 
okhrane  prirody — Goskompriroda),  an  agency  given  broad 
responsibilities  similar  to  those  of  the  United  States  Environ- 
mental Protection  Agency.  In  1992  the  Russian  Federation 
used  Goskompriroda  as  the  model  for  a  new  Ministry  of  Envi- 
ronmental Protection  and  Natural  Resources,  which  received  a 
similar  mandate. 

In  the  1990  elections  for  Russia's  local  legislative  bodies 
(soviets)  and  the  republic-level  Congress  of  People's  Deputies, 
virtually  every  candidate,  whether  democrat  or  communist, 
made  the  environment  a  major  campaign  issue,  thus  promot- 
ing the  electorate's  awareness  that  severe  problems  exist.  In 
1990  Yablokov  was  appointed  to  an  influential  position  as  envi- 
ronmental adviser  to  the  president  of  Russia  (a  position  he 
continued  to  hold  in  the  Russian  Federation  after  1991),  and 
powerful  environmental  commissions  were  formed  in  the  local 
Soviets  of  Moscow  and  other  cities.  In  the  early  1990s,  such  Sovi- 
ets blocked  many  large,  environmentally  dubious  projects  of 
the  central  government,  such  as  the  activation  of  the  Northern 
Thermoelectric  Center  near  Moscow,  and  of  various  local  juris- 
dictions tied  to  national  monopolies,  such  as  the  State  Con- 
struction Committee  (Goskomstroy)  and  the  Ministry  of 
Atomic  Energy  (Minatom). 

By  the  time  of  the  parliamentary  elections  of  1993,  however, 
the  political  atmosphere  had  changed.  Most  environmental 
activists  either  abstained  from  political  activity  or  merged  their 
single-issue  efforts  with  coalitions  that  might  exceed  the  5  per- 
cent threshold  needed  for  a  party  to  gain  representation  in  the 
State  Duma.  Neither  strategy  had  political  impact  because  envi- 
ronmental views  were  lost  in  the  coalitions'  agendas.  Among 
the  major  parties,  only  the  Yabloko  coalition  had  a  separate 
department  for  environmental  issues.  Another  major  reform- 
minded  party,  Russia's  Choice,  which  gained  seventy-six  seats  in 
1993,  advocated  environmental  protection  through  market 
reform;  Russia's  minister  of  environmental  protection  and  nat- 
ural resources,  former  communist  functionary  Viktor  Danilov- 


149 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Danil'yan,  was  a  member  of  Russia's  Choice.  However,  neither 
in  the  campaign  nor  after  assuming  office  did  Danilov- 
Danil'yan  press  the  party's  nominal  program  of  tax  stimulation 
for  energy  conservation  and  pollution  control.  In  the  1995  leg- 
islative elections,  Russia's  Democratic  Choice  (the  new  name  of 
Russia's  Choice)  declined  dramatically,  gaining  only  nine  seats 
in  the  new  State  Duma,  although  Danilov-Danil'yan  remained 
head  of  his  ministry. 

A  crucial  event  was  the  1992  appointment  of  Viktor  Cherno- 
myrdin as  prime  minister  to  replace  Yegor  Gaydar,  head  of  Rus- 
sia's Choice.  Chernomyrdin,  former  head  of  the  State  Natural 
Gas  Company  (Gazprom),  has  made  the  reinvigoration  of  Rus- 
sian industry,  and  especially  the  fuel  industries,  a  top  priority.  A 
second  important  event  was  President  Yeltsin's  dismissal  of  the 
local  Soviets  in  his  1993  struggle  to  consolidate  presidential 
power  and  curb  the  growth  of  regional  autonomy.  The  local 
dumas  that  replaced  the  Soviets  have  been  much  more  solici- 
tous of  local  economic  ambitions. 

In  the  parliamentary  elections  of  1995,  the  Kedr  (Cedar) 
coalition  (which  also  had  presented  a  slate  in  the  1993  elec- 
tion) was  the  only  group  among  forty-three  parties  calling  itself 
environmental;  however,  the  party  was  dominated  by  business- 
people  rather  than  environmental  activists.  Kedr  candidates 
received  less  than  1  percent  of  the  vote  and  no  seats  in  the  new 
State  Duma.  Some  nongovernmental  groups  have  continued  to 
have  political  impact,  and  in  1995  Yablokov  hailed  a  new  wave 
of  the  green  movement.  The  annual  Days  of  Defense  Against 
Environmental  Hazards,  which  began  modestly  in  1993, 
became  a  national  phenomenon  the  next  year  and  included  a 
speech  by  President  Yeltsin.  Public  organizations  played  a 
major  role  in  establishing  the  All-Russian  Congress  for  the  Pro- 
tection of  Nature  under  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protec- 
tion and  Natural  Resources.  The  national  congress  is  preceded 
each  year  by  eighty-nine  regional  congresses,  one  in  each  of 
Russia's  political  subdivisions.  In  late  1993,  the  new  Commis- 
sion on  Ecological  Security  went  into  operation  under  the 
Security  Council,  with  the  assignment  of  assessing  the  most 
serious  environmental  problems  as  they  endanger  national 
security  (see  The  Security  Council,  ch.  8).  Although  it  was 
formed  with  great  fanfare,  the  commission  received  little  fund- 
ing in  its  first  three  years. 

In  1994  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  and  Natu- 
ral Resources  employed  about  21,000  people.  In  addition,  the 


150

official  Russian  environmental  protection  system  included 
environmental  agencies  in  each  of  the  eighty-nine  subnational 
jurisdictions  and  also  several  state  committees  responsible  for 
the  use  of  mineral,  water,  and  forest  resources.  In  1993  some  65 
percent  of  the  ministry's  expenditures  went  for  protection  of 
water  quality  and  26  percent  for  protection  of  air  quality.  How- 
ever, the  ministry's  actions  against  major  polluters  remained 
infrequent  despite  the  1993  constitution's  guarantee  of  the 
people's  right  to  a  clean  environment,  to  receive  information 
about  environmental  conditions,  and  to  get  compensation  for 
damage  to  health  and  property  that  results  from  negative  eco- 
logical conditions.  In  1995  Danilov-Danil'yan  reported  that 
only  twenty-two  cases  had  been  brought  against  alleged  pollut- 
ers in  the  previous  year. 

In  1993  Russia's  total  investment  in  environmental  preserva- 
tion was  about  US$2.3  billion,  less  than  4  percent  of  the 
national  budget  category  entitled  "industrial  construction,"  in 
which  environmental  expenditures  are  included.  That  figure 


151 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

was  20  percent  less  than  the  1990  investment.  The  structure  of 
environmental  spending  remained  substantially  the  same  as  it 
was  in  1980:  some  58  percent  went  for  protection  of  water 
resources,  24  percent  for  prevention  of  air  pollution,  7  percent 
for  forest  management,  and  only  0.04  percent  for  nature  pre- 
serves and  species  protection  (see  table  5,  Appendix).  In  most 
subnational  jurisdictions,  water  pollution  receives  the  most 
investment  because  of  uniformly  serious  water  conditions. 

In  1993  state  enterprises  and  organizations  paid  39  percent 
of  environmental  costs.  As  state  budget  deficits  occurred  in 
subsequent  years,  the  amounts  from  those  sources  decreased, 
but  the  percentage  did  not  because  the  only  other  funding 
sources  were  local  budgets  and  private  environmental  founda- 
tions. Budgets  of  subnational  jurisdictions  often  suffered  the 
same  deficits  as  the  federal  government,  and  private  organiza- 
tions contributed  only  1.4  percent  of  total  investments  in  1993. 
Meanwhile,  local  economic  conditions  have  combined  with 
weak  enforcement  funding  to  promote  corruption  among 
local  authorities  and  to  encourage  poaching,  especially  in  the 
fishing  industry. 

In  1991  Yeltsin  signed  Russia's  first  comprehensive  environ- 
mental law,  On  Environmental  Protection.  Modeled  after  a 
similar  Soviet  law,  it  made  many  general  statements  about  the 
environmental  rights  of  citizens  without  setting  any  specific 
goals.  The  law  also  defined  numerous  environmental  functions 
for  every  level  of  government  as  well  as  for  citizens  and  nongov- 
ernmental organizations,  and  it  specified  environmental  regu- 
lation of  every  aspect  of  society,  from  health  resorts  to 
electromagnetic  radiation.  The  sheer  inclusiveness  of  such  pro- 
visions made  practical  enforcement  impossible.  The  other 
major  obstacle  to  enforcement  has  been  the  slow  development 
of  Russia's  judiciary,  which  was  only  a  rubber-stamp  branch  of 
government  in  the  Soviet  system  and  which  totally  lacked  expe- 
rience in  the  area  of  environmental  law  (as  well  as  the  general 
theory  of  Western-style  jurisprudence)  (see  The  Criminal  Jus- 
tice System,  ch.  10).  Before  any  enforcement  could  begin,  the 
1991  law  stipulated  that  numerous  other  laws  had  to  be  passed. 
The  same  complex  situation  has  existed  at  the  regional  and 
local  government  levels.  In  early  1995,  the  State  Duma  passed  a 
law  requiring  environmental  impact  assessments  for  a  variety  of 
construction  and  development  projects,  including  large-scale 
industrial  development,  large-scale  use  of  natural  resources, 


152 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

city  planning,  creation  of  new  technology  and  materials,  and 
modification  of  existing  commercial  facilities. 

Russia  is  a  signatory  of  most  major  international  environ- 
mental treaties.  Among  them  are  the  International  Tropical 
Timber  Agreement  (1983),  the  Convention  on  International 
Trade  in  Endangered  Species  (CITES,  1973),  the  United 
Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (1982),  and  the 
Montreal  Protocol  controlling  substances  harmful  to  the  ozone 
layer. 

Population 

The  population  in  what  is  now  the  Russian  Federation  has 
undergone  several  major  shocks  in  the  twentieth  century, 
including  large-scale  rural  famines  in  the  1920s  and  1930s  and 
the  loss  of  millions  of  citizens  in  World  War  II.  According  to 
demographic  experts,  the  early  1990s  may  be  the  start  of  a 
more  gradual  but  potentially  powerful  new  shift.  Beginning  in 
1992,  the  population  has  suffered  a  net  loss  that  is  projected  to 
continue  at  least  through  the  first  decade  of  the  next  century 
This  phenomenon  is  caused  by  a  combination  of  economic, 
political,  and  ethnographic  factors. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  Russians  constituted  about  82  percent  of 
the  population  of  the  Russian  Federation,  and  they  dominate 
virtually  all  regions  of  the  country  except  for  the  North  Cauca- 
sus and  parts  of  the  middle  Volga  region  (see  Minority  Peoples 
and  Their  Territories,  ch.  4).  The  major  ethnic  minorities  are 
Tatars  (3.8  percent),  Ukrainians  (3.0  percent),  Chuvash  (1.2 
percent),  Bashkirs  (0.9  percent),  Belarusians  (0.8  percent), 
and  Mordovians  (0.7  percent).  The  total  population  of  the 
twenty-one  ethnic  republics,  all  designated  for  one  or  more  of 
the  minority  groups  in  the  federation,  was  about  24  million. 
However,  only  in  eight  of  the  republics  was  the  population  of 
the  titular  group  (or  groups,  in  the  case  of  Kabardino-Balkaria 
and  Karachayevo-Cherkessia)  larger  than  the  population  of 
Russians,  and  Russians  constitute  more  than  half  the  popula- 
tion in  nine  republics.  One  other  ethnic  jurisdiction,  the 
Khanty-Mansi  Autonomous  Region  in  the  West  Siberian  Plain, 
has  a  population  of  more  than  1  million;  however,  two-thirds  of 
the  autonomous  region's  population  are  Russian  settlers,  and 
the  Khanty  and  Mansi,  the  tribes  for  which  the  region  is 
named,  together  constitute  less  than  2  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Demographic  Conditions 

The  range  of  estimates  for  Russia's  1995  population  is 
between  147.5  and  149.9  million.  Roughly  78  percent  of  Rus- 
sia's population  lives  in  the  European  part  of  Russia;  most  of 
the  industrial  cities  with  over  1  million  inhabitants  are  located 
in  the  European  part.  In  order  of  size,  the  largest  Russian  cities 
are  Moscow  (8.7  million  people  in  1992),  St.  Petersburg  (4.4 
million),  Novosibirsk  (1.4  million),  Nizhniy  Novgorod  (1.4  mil- 
lion), Yekaterinburg  (1.4  million),  Samara  (1.2  million),  Omsk 
(1.2  million),  Chelyabinsk  (1.1  million),  and  Kazan'  (1.1  mil- 
lion). Of  those  cities,  only  Novosibirsk  and  Omsk  are  located 
east  of  the  Urals.  In  1995  Russia's  population  density  was  8.7 
persons  per  square  kilometer,  but  distribution  varies  from 
more  than  200  persons  per  square  kilometer  in  parts  of  Euro- 
pean Russia,  to  0.03  person  per  square  kilometer  in  the  Evenk 
Autonomous  Region  of  Siberia. 

According  to  most  sources,  the  population  of  the  present 
Russian  Federation  peaked  in  1991  at  148,689,000.  Even  with 
significant  increases  in  immigration  in  the  early  1990s,  the  Rus- 
sian population  has  been  shrinking  since  1992;  according  to 
projections  by  the  Center  for  Economic  Analysis  of  the  Russian 
Federation,  immigration  will  make  a  very  small  dent  in  a  con- 
tinued negative  natural  increase  through  the  year  2005.  Thus, 
for  the  period  1985-2005,  projected  total  immigration  is  3.3 
million,  whereas  the  natural  population  will  decrease  by  12.9 
million.  The  annual  rate  of  population  change,  which  dropped 
from  0.7  percent  in  1985  to  its  first  negative  figure  of  -0.3  per- 
cent in  1992,  is  projected  to  reach  -0.6  percent  in  1998  and  to 
continue  at  that  level  through  2005. 

Several  reasons  are  given  for  the  decline  in  Russia's  popula- 
tion. First,  the  postwar  baby  boom,  which  began  echoing  in  a 
secondary  population  rise  in  many  Western  countries  in  the 
early  1990s,  had  much  less  demographic  impact  in  Russia.  Sec- 
ond, a  long  history  of  Soviet  ecological  abuse  has  planted  still 
unquantifiable  seeds  of  demographic  decline  throughout  the 
population,  especially  in  areas  of  concentrated  industry,  mili- 
tary installations,  and  intensive  agriculture.  Third,  post-Soviet 
Russia  has  experienced  a  general  decline  in  health  conditions 
and  health  care  (see  Health,  ch.  5). 

In  addition,  the  prolonged  economic  downturn  of  the  early 
and  mid-1990s,  in  which  an  estimated  31  percent  of  the  popu- 
lation (46.5  million  people)  had  incomes  below  the  poverty 
level,  has  increased  the  incidence  of  malnutrition,  which  in 


154 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

turn  lowers  resistance  to  common  ailments.  Only  individuals 
who  have  their  own  gardens  are  assured  a  regular  supply  of 
fruits  and  vegetables  (see  table  6,  Appendix) .  Even  under  the 
Soviet  system,  the  average  Russian's  diet  was  classified  as  defi- 
cient, so  the  population  now  shows  the  cumulative  effects  of 
earlier  living  conditions  as  well  as  current  limitations.  Poor  eco- 
nomic prospects,  together  with  low  confidence  in  the  state's 
family  benefits  programs,  discourage  Russians  from  planning 
families;  the  least  positive  "reproductive  attitudes"  have  been 
found  in  the  Urals  and  in  northeastern  Siberia. 

Experts  have  identified  a  number  of  general  demographic 
trends  that  are  likely  to  prevail  between  1996  and  2005.  Con- 
trary to  the  trend  in  Western  countries  of  a  shrinking  working 
population  supporting  an  expanding  community  of  retired 
individuals,  in  Russia  a  declining  life  expectancy  and  a  declin- 
ing birthrate  will  increase  marginally  the  proportion  of  active 
workers  in  the  population.  The  actual  number  of  such  people 
is  not  likely  to  rise  appreciably,  however,  and  some  analyses 
project  a  decline  in  this  figure  as  well.  In  1992,  for  every  1,000 
people  of  working  age,  771  people  were  outside  working  age; 
the  Center  for  Economic  Analysis  projects  that  in  2005  that 
proportion  will  drop  to  560  per  1,000.  The  declining  birthrate 
is  projected  to  cause  the  ratio  of  younger-than-working-age 
individuals  in  the  population  to  decrease  dramatically  from  the 
1992  figure  of  421  per  1,000  in  the  working-age  group  to  only 
241  per  1,000  in  2005.  According  to  that  scenario,  the  overall 
percentage  of  the  population  in  the  working-age  group  would 
increase  from  56.5  to  64.1. 

Most  of  the  demographic  disasters  that  have  beset  Russia  in 
the  twentieth  century  have  affected  primarily  males.  In  1992 
the  sex  ratio  was  884  males  per  1,000  females;  in  the  years 
between  1994  and  2005,  the  imbalance  is  projected  to  increase 
slightly  to  a  ratio  of  875  males  per  1,000  females  (see  table  7, 
Appendix).  Gender  disparity  has  increased  because  of  a  sharp 
drop  in  life  expectancy  for  Russian  males,  from  sixty-five  years 
in  1987  to  fifty-seven  in  1994.  (Life  expectancy  for  females 
reached  a  peak  of  74.5  years  in  1989,  then  dropped  to  71.1  by 
1994.)  Projected  changes  in  life  expectancy  are  negative  for 
both  sexes,  however.  Mortality  figures  that  the  Ministry  of 
Labor  released  in  mid-1995  showed  that  if  the  current  condi- 
tions persist,  nearly  50  percent  of  today's  Russian  youth  will  not 
reach  the  retirement  ages  of  fifty-five  for  women  and  sixty  for 
men.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  process  of  urbanization  of  the  Russian  population, 
ongoing  since  the  1930s,  began  a  gradual  reversal  in  1991, 
when  a  peak  of  74  percent  of  the  population  was  classified  as 
urban.  This  marked  a  significant  increase  from  the  1970  figure 
of  62  percent.  In  1995  the  urban  share  fell  below  73  percent. 
Meanwhile,  rural  areas  continued  to  lose  significant  portions 
of  their  population.  Between  1960  and  1995,  about  two-thirds 
of  Russia's  small  villages  (those  with  fewer  than  1,000  residents) 
disappeared;  of  the  24,000  that  remained  in  the  mid-1990s, 
more  than  half  the  population  was  older  than  sixty-five  and 
only  20  percent  was  younger  than  thirty-five  (see  Rural  Life,  ch. 
5).  Migration  has  exacerbated  the  negative  population  trend  of 
lower  marriage  and  birthrates  in  many  rural  settlements.  As  the 
young  have  left  rural  Russia,  large  rural  sections  of  the  coun- 
try's central  region  have  been  deserted.  As  their  aged  inhabit- 
ants die,  thousands  more  Russian  villages  are  disappearing. 
Proposals  have  been  put  forth  for  resettling  some  of  the  Rus- 
sian immigrants  from  the  "near  abroad"  in  rural  areas  in  order 
to  revive  local  economies,  but  in  the  mid-1990s  migration 
authorities  had  little  authority  and  few  resources  with  which  to 
organize  such  a  program. 

A  particular  demographic  concern  of  the  Russian  govern- 
ment, as  well  as  governments  of  the  other  states  of  the  Com- 
monwealth of  Independent  States  (CIS — see  Glossary),  is  the 
loss  of  highly  skilled  personnel.  This  problem  had  existed  in 
the  last  decade  of  the  Soviet  Union;  in  1989  some  2,653 
employees  of  the  Soviet  Union's  Academy  of  Sciences  left  the 
country,  five  times  more  than  in  1988.  A  1990  sociological  fore- 
cast predicted  that  1.5  million  specialists  would  leave  the  coun- 
try in  the  1990s  if  conditions  did  not  improve. 

The  easing  of  emigration  restrictions  in  the  early  1990s 
resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  Russia's  "brain  drain."  In 
the  early  1990s,  China,  North  Korea,  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea),  Iran,  Iraq,  and  several  Latin  American  coun- 
tries offered  jobs  to  scientists  in  Russia,  especially  those  with 
nuclear  backgrounds.  (Russia  also  loses  scientific  know-how 
when  its  scientists  move  into  the  growing  financial  and  com- 
mercial fields;  in  1994  the  newspaper  Moskovskiye  novosti 
reported  than  one  in  three  leaders  of  commercial  structures 
was  a  former  scientist  or  technical  specialist.)  An  ongoing  eco- 
nomic crisis  and  political  uncertainty  encourage  individuals 
with  marketable  skills  to  leave  Russia.  A  high  percentage  of 
immigrants  from  other  CIS  republics  possess  the  same  type  of 


156 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 


skills  as  those  being  lost,  but  in  the  mid-1990s  Russia  lacked  a 
program  for  settling  and  apportioning  the  newcomers  so  that 
their  presence  would  compensate  for  emigration  losses. 

Fertility 

With  the  exception  of  a  few  ethnic  groups  in  the  North  Cau- 
casus, birthrates  for  all  nationalities  in  Russia  have  generally 
declined  in  the  postwar  period  (see  Ethnic  Composition,  ch. 
4) .  Throughout  the  Soviet  period,  urbanization  was  rapid,  and 
urban  families  generally  had  fewer  children  than  rural  ones. 
The  urbanization  process  ended  in  1992,  when  for  the  first 
time  in  the  postwar  period  a  smaller  percentage  of  the  Russian 
population  lived  in  cities  than  the  year  before.  By  that  time, 
however,  substantial  reasons  existed  for  Russians  to  limit  the 
size  of  their  families.  The  population  decline  of  the  Russians 
has  been  especially  pronounced  in  comparison  with  other  eth- 
nic groups.  In  many  of  the  twenty-one  republics,  the  titular 
nationalities  have  registered  higher  birthrates  and  larger  aver- 
age family  sizes  than  the  Russian  populations. 

The  birthrate  of  Russians  already  was  falling  dramatically  in 
the  1960s,  moving  from  23.2  per  1,000  population  at  the  begin- 
ning of  the  decade  to  14.1  in  1968.  By  1983  the  rate  had  recov- 
ered to  17.3  per  1,000,  stimulated  by  a  state  program  that 
provided  incentives  for  larger  families,  including  increased 
maternity  benefits.  Another  decline  in  the  birthrate  began  in 
1987,  and  by  1993  the  rate  was  only  9.4  per  1,000.  According  to 
the  projections  of  the  Center  for  Economic  Analysis,  after 
reaching  its  lowest  point  (8.0  per  1,000)  in  1995,  the  birthrate 
will  rise  gradually  to  9.7  per  1,000  in  2005. 

In  the  turnaround  year  of  1992,  the  number  of  births  in  Rus- 
sia dropped  by  207,000  (13  percent)  compared  with  1991,  and 
the  number  of  deaths  increased  by  116,000  (7  percent).  The 
fertility  rate  has  dropped  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas.  In  the 
early  1990s,  the  lowest  rates  were  in  the  northwest,  especially 
St.  Petersburg  and  in  central  European  Russia.  The  disparity 
between  birth  and  death  rates  was  especially  pronounced  in 
the  cities  of  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  and  in  the  European 
oblasts  of  Pskov,  Tula,  Tver',  Belgorod,  Leningrad,  Novgorod, 
Yaroslavl',  Moscow,  Tambov,  and  Ivanovo.  In  1992  natural  pop- 
ulation growth  occurred  only  in  the  republics  of  Kalmykia, 
Dagestan,  Kabardino-Balkaria,  Karachayevo-Cherkessia,  North 
Ossetia,  Chechnya,  Ingushetia,  Gorno-Altay,  Sakha,  and  Tyva, 
and  in  Tyumen'  and  Chita  oblasts  of  western  and  eastern  Sibe- 


157 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

ria,  respectively.  However,  although  fertility  rates  in  the  pre- 
dominantly Muslim  republics  of  the  North  Caucasus  and  the 
Volga  region  continued  to  exceed  those  of  the  Slavic  popula- 
tion, by  1995  the  rate  was  declining  even  in  Dagestan,  the 
republic  with  the  highest  birthrate  in  Russia. 

For  Russians  the  total  fertility  rate,  which  is  the  average  num- 
ber of  children  a  woman  of  childbearing  age  will  have  at  cur- 
rent birthrates,  fell  from  2.0  in  1989  to  1.4  in  1993.  The  State 
Committee  for  Statistics  (Goskomstat)  estimates  that  the  rate 
will  decline  further  to  1.0  by  the  year  2000.  Roughly  half  as 
many  children  were  born  in  1993  as  in  1987.  In  1994  the  popu- 
lation of  Russia  fell  by  920,000. 

The  sharp  decline  in  the  fertility  rate  in  the  1990s  was  linked 
to  the  social  and  economic  troubles  triggered  by  the  rapid  tran- 
sition to  a  market  economy  and  resulting  unemployment.  Fam- 
ilies have  been  destabilized,  and  living  standards  for  many  have 
fallen  from  even  the  modest  levels  of  the  Soviet  era  (see  The 
Family,  ch.  5).  Under  such  circumstances,  decisions  on  mar- 
riage and  childbearing  often  are  postponed.  Particularly  in  the 
cities,  housing  has  been  extremely  hard  to  acquire,  and  the 
percentage  of  working  wives  has  increased  significantly  in  the 
post-Soviet  era  (see  The  Role  of  Women,  ch.  5).  The  number  of 
common-law  marriages,  which  produce  fewer  children  than 
traditional  marriages,  has  increased  since  the  1960s,  as  has  the 
percentage  of  babies  born  to  unattached  women. 

History  also  has  affected  the  absolute  number  of  births.  The 
birthrate  during  World  War  II  was  very  low,  accounting  for  part 
of  the  low  birthrate  of  females  in  the  1960s,  which  in  turn  low- 
ered the  rate  in  the  1990s.  Between  1989  and  1993,  the  number 
of  women  in  the  prime  childbearing  age-group  decreased  by 
1.3  million,  or  12  percent,  making  a  major  contribution  to  the 
27  percent  decline  in  births  during  that  period.  Between  1990 
and  1994,  the  government's  official  estimate  of  the  infant  mor- 
tality rate  rose  from  17.4  per  1,000  live  births  to  19.9,  reflecting 
deterioration  of  Russia's  child  care  and  nutrition  standards. 
But  Russia  has  not  used  international  viability  standards  for 
newborns,  and  one  Western  estimate  placed  the  1995  rate  at 
26.3.  Between  1992  and  1995,  the  official  maternal  mortality 
rate  also  rose  from  forty-seven  to  fifty-two  deaths  per  100,000 
births. 

Abortion 

Fertility  in  Russia  has  been  adversely  affected  by  the  com- 


158 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 


mon  practice  of  using  abortion  as  a  primary  means  of  birth 
control.  In  1920  the  Soviet  Union  was  the  first  country  to  legal- 
ize abortion.  Sixteen  years  later  it  was  prohibited,  except  in  cer- 
tain circumstances,  to  compensate  for  the  millions  of  lives  lost 
in  the  collectivization  of  agriculture  and  the  widespread  famine 
that  followed  in  the  1930s.  The  practice  was  fully  legalized  once 
again  in  1968,  and  an  entire  industry  evolved  offering  abortion 
services  and  encouraging  women  to  use  them.  Although  abor- 
tions became  easily  available  for  most  women,  an  estimated  15 
percent  of  the  Soviet  total  were  performed  illegally  in  private 
facilities.  Because  of  the  persistent  lack  of  contraceptive  devices 
in  both  Soviet  and  independent  Russia  (and  the  social  taboo 
on  discussion  of  contraception  and  sex  in  general,  which  con- 
tinued in  the  1990s),  for  most  women  abortion  remains  the 
only  reliable  method  of  avoiding  unwanted  pregnancy  (see 
Health  Conditions;  Sexual  Attitudes,  ch.  5).  Russia  continues 
to  have  the  highest  abortion  rate  in  the  world,  as  did  the  Soviet 
Union.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  Russian  average  was  225  termi- 
nated pregnancies  per  100  births  and  ninety-eight  abortions 
for  every  1,000  women  of  childbearing  age  per  year — a  yearly 
average  of  3.5  million.  An  estimated  one-quarter  of  maternal 
fatalities  result  from  abortion  procedures. 

Mortality 

The  social  and  economic  crises  that  gripped  Russia  in  the 
early  1990s  are  reflected  in  increased  mortality  and  declining 
life  expectancy,  especially  among  able-bodied  males.  Contribut- 
ing to  Russia's  long-term  population  decline  is  a  projected  mor- 
tality rate  increase  from  11.3  per  1,000  population  in  1985  to 
15.9  per  1,000  in  2005.  Russia's  mortality  rate  reached  its  lowest 
level,  10.4  per  1,000  population,  in  1986  (for  which  a  state  anti- 
alcohol  campaign  received  substantial  credit) ;  then  the  figure 
rose  steadily  in  the  ensuing  decade.  The  largest  jump  was  from 
12.2  to  14.6  per  1,000  between  1992  and  1993;  after  having 
reached  15.7  per  1,000  in  1995,  the  rate  was  projected  to 
remain  virtually  flat  over  the  next  decade. 

According  to  1994  statistics,  the  life  expectancy  for  Russian 
males  had  reached  57.3  years  and  for  females  71.1  years.  These 
are  the  lowest  figures  and  the  largest  disparity  by  sex  for  any 
country  reporting  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  and  they 
are  a  sharp  decline  from  the  1987  levels  of  64.9  years  for  males 
and  74.6  years  for  females.  In  1990  the  Russian  Republic 
ranked  only  seventh  in  this  statistic  among  the  fifteen  republics 


159 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  lag  in  the  average  life  expectancy  of 
males  was  attributed  to  alcohol  and  tobacco  abuse;  to  unsafe 
conditions  at  work,  on  the  road,  and  in  the  home;  and  to 
declining  heath  care. 

Mortality  rates  are  especially  high  for  able-bodied  males  in 
rural  areas.  Served  poorly  by  the  health  care  system  and  lack- 
ing basic  sanitary  facilities  and  conveniences,  many  farming 
communities  have  been  transformed  into  enclaves  for  the  eld- 
erly, the  indigent,  and  the  sick.  Moreover,  indigenous  national- 
ities such  as  the  Evenks  and  the  Nenets  have  suffered 
catastrophic  declines  in  life  expectancy  and  high  rates  of  sick- 
ness and  death  that  have  prompted  speculation  that  some  of 
those  groups  may  become  extinct.  Geographically,  the  lowest 
average  life  expectancy  in  Russia  is  in  the  Siberian  Republic  of 
Tyva,  and  the  highest  figures  are  in  the  Caucasus  Republic  of 
Dagestan  and  in  the  Volga  region.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s, 
the  imbalance  between  the  birth  and  death  rates  was  especially 
acute  in  major  cities.  In  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg,  the  num- 
ber of  deaths  in  1992  was  almost  double  the  number  of  births. 

Since  1987  mortality  from  accidents,  injuries,  and  poison- 
ings has  risen  significantly,  from  101  to  228  per  100,000  popula- 
tion. Contributing  to  that  figure  are  an  estimated  8,000  fatal 
workplace  accidents  per  year,  largely  the  result  of  aging  equip- 
ment, the  proliferation  of  risky  jobs  in  the  unofficial  "shadow 
economy,"  and  the  deterioration  of  work  discipline.  For  the 
period  between  1990  and  1994,  the  suicide  rate  rose  by  57  per- 
cent to  a  total  of  nearly  62,000,  putting  Russia  in  third  place 
among  eighty-four  developed  countries.  The  stress  of  the  tran- 
sition period  is  one  explanation  for  this  rising  statistic.  The 
homicide  rate  rose  by  more  than  50  percent  in  the  same  period 
(see  Crime,  ch.  10).  In  1994  Russia's  35,000  motor  vehicle 
deaths  nearly  equaled  the  40,000  in  the  United  States, 
although  Russia  has  less  than  1  percent  as  many  automobiles. 
Deteriorating  roads  and  declining  police  discipline  are  the 
main  causes  of  that  fatality  statistic. 

The  chief  natural  cause  of  death  is  diseases  of  the  circulatory 
system,  which  accounted  for  769  deaths  per  100,000  popula- 
tion in  1993.  The  next  causes  in  order  of  frequency  are  cancer 
and  respiratory  diseases.  Among  people  of  working  age,  41  per- 
cent of  deaths  are  attributable  to  unnatural  causes;  the  propor- 
tion of  such  deaths  was  highest  in  Leningrad  Oblast,  the 
Permyak  Autonomous  Region,  the  Republic  of  Tyva,  and  the 
Evenk  Autonomous  Region.  The  number  of  alcohol-related 


160 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

deaths  also  climbed  in  the  mid-1990s;  the  1994  figure  was  25 
percent  higher  than  the  1993  total.  In  some  regions,  alcohol- 
ism has  assumed  epidemic  proportions;  in  the  Bikin  Rayon  of 
Khabarovsk  Territory  on  the  Pacific  coast,  nearly  half  the 
deaths  between  1991  and  1995  were  alcohol  related  (see 
Health  Conditions,  ch.  5) . 

The  overall  aging  of  the  population  also  is  an  important  fac- 
tor in  the  higher  mortality  rate.  Between  1959  and  1989,  the 
percentage  of  retirees  in  the  population  and  the  percentage  of 
Russians  eighty  or  older  nearly  doubled,  although  declining 
life  expectancy  already  was  reducing  the  impact  of  that  trend  in 
the  mid-1990s. 

Migration 

For  most  of  the  postwar  period,  the  state  tightly  controlled 
migration  into  and  emigration  from  the  Soviet  Union  and 
movement  within  the  nation.  Nevertheless,  in  each  year  of  the 
1980s,  about  15  million  citizens  changed  their  place  of  resi- 
dence within  the  Soviet  Union,  and  large  numbers  of  some  eth- 
nic groups,  most  notably  Jews,  Germans,  and  Armenians,  were 
successful  in  emigrating.  An  estimated  2  million  Jews  left  the 
Soviet  Union  between  1945  and  1991  (see  Other  Religions,  ch. 
4).  Overall,  external  migration  played  a  relatively  minor  role  in 
the  structure  of  the  Russian  Republic's  population. 

With  the  introduction  of  the  policies  of  glasnost  and  pere- 
stroika  (see  Glossary)  in  the  late  1980s,  migration  policy  began 
to  change.  In  1985  just  2,943  persons  received  official  permis- 
sion to  emigrate.  By  1990  the  figure  had  risen  to  more  than 
100,000.  After  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  legisla- 
tive and  administrative  changes  brought  about  new  policies 
with  respect  to  migration.  First,  the  traditional  internal  pass- 
port (propiska)  that  conferred  permission  to  work  and  live  in  a 
specific  place  was  nominally  abolished,  enhancing  freedom  of 
movement  within  Russia.  Second,  the  general  right  to  emigrate 
was  written  into  law  in  the  1993  constitution. 

Prior  to  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  major  his- 
torical internal  migration  paths  were  from  the  western  parts  of 
Russia  and  the  Soviet  Union  to  the  northern  and  eastern 
regions.  In  contrast  to  the  American  experience,  Russia  has 
had  difficulty  in  stabilizing  the  population  in  newly  settled  east- 
ern and  northern  areas  of  the  federation,  where  the  climate 
and  living  conditions  are  harsh.  Despite  pay  and  benefit  incen- 
tives, turnover  has  continued  to  hamper  the  operations  of  the 


161 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

giant  territorial  production  complexes,  especially  in  the  key 
energy  sector. 

In  the  Soviet  period,  immigration  was  not  a  problem 
because  the  Soviet  Union  was  not  a  destination  of  preference 
for  any  class  of  refugee.  For  that  reason,  in  the  early  1990s  Rus- 
sia was  not  equipped  with  agencies  or  laws  for  dealing  with  a 
large-scale  influx  of  asylum  seekers  and  returning  Russians.  In 
light  of  new  demographic  movements  in  the  1990s,  however, 
respected  academician  Dmitriy  Likhachev  has  warned  that  in 
the  next  decade  immigration  may  become  a  national  concern 
of  the  same  magnitude  as  national  defense. 

Issues  and  Procedures 

In  1993  Russia  signed  the  United  Nations  Convention  on 
Refugees,  which  reclassified  it  as  a  "country  of  first  resort"  for 
foreigners  fleeing  countries  outside  the  CIS.  Under  the  1951 
United  Nations  convention,  this  status  entails  an  international 
obligation  to  care  for  such  individuals.  At  the  same  time,  the 
decline  in  border  security  since  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet 
Union  has  made  illegal  immigration  easier  in  many  areas.  In 
the  early  1990s,  the  number  of  official  refugees  swelled  when 
students  from  Third  World  nations,  particularly  Afghanistan, 
refused  to  leave  Russia  when  their  studies  were  completed. 
According  to  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refu- 
gees (UNHCR),  about  28,000  foreign  refugees  were  living  ille- 
gally in  Moscow  in  1994;  figures  for  other  parts  of  Russia  are 
not  available.  The  UNHCR's  Moscow  total  was  divided  among 
20,000  Afghans,  6,000  Iraqis,  2,000  Somalis,  and  smaller  num- 
bers of  Angolans,  Ethiopians,  and  Zairians.  A  1995  Moscow 
press  report,  however,  estimated  that  100,000  illegal  immi- 
grants were  living  in  Moscow,  including  50,000  Chinese  and 
15,000  Afghans. 

The  first  major  influx  of  refugees  into  the  Russian  Republic 
occurred  in  1988  and  1989,  when  Azerbaijanis  and  Armenians 
(mainly  the  latter)  fled  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict 
between  their  respective  countries,  and  when  Meskhetian 
Turks  fled  Uzbekistan  following  a  massacre  in  that  republic  in 
1989.  However,  only  in  1992  did  the  Russian  government  estab- 
lish its  first  agency  for  dealing  with  such  conditions,  the  Fed- 
eral Migration  Service  (FMS).  That  service  monitors  refugees 
and  other  migrants  from  both  outside  and  within  the  CIS,  but 
it  is  underfunded  and  understaffed.  In  1994  UNHCR  transit 
camps  in  Moscow  had  a  capacity  of  1,000,  leaving  a  large  num- 


162 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

ber  of  Moscow's  refugee  population  to  live  in  primitive  condi- 
tions. Given  the  FMS's  limited  resources,  several  international 
social  and  charitable  organizations  are  active  in  aiding  refugees 
and  migrants,  although  their  work  has  not  been  well  coordi- 
nated with  the  FMS  or  among  themselves.  An  additional  com- 
plication in  the  early  1990s  was  the  influx  of  tens  of  thousands 
of  Russian  military  personnel  withdrawn  from  former  Warsaw 
Pact  member  nations  and  from  other  CIS  nations. 

In  response  to  Russia's  new  status  as  a  country  of  first  resort, 
a  series  of  laws  on  refugees  and  forced  migrants  were  passed  in 
1993  and  1994.  The  laws  define  various  categories  of  migrants, 
particularly  refugees  and  forced  migrants,  according  to  the 
conditions  and  motivations  that  prompted  their  movement  as 
well  as  the  responsibilities  of  the  state  to  care  for  them. 

Local  branches  of  the  FMS  conduct  registration  of  refugees 
and  forced  migrants  and  are  responsible  for  providing  material 
support  until  they  are  classified.  Individuals  in  both  categories 
theoretically  have  some  input  in  their  new  place  of  residence; 
the  FMS  provides  a  list  of  permissible  urban  destinations,  or 
relatives  may  accept  them  elsewhere.  Legally,  the  FMS  is 
obliged  to  help  find  suitable  employment,  schools,  and  social 
security  and  to  aid  in  compensation  for  lost  property.  FMS 
activities  receive  funding  from  the  Russian  state  budget,  other 
countries  and  international  organizations  according  to  bilat- 
eral agreements,  and  private  donations.  Russian  citizenship  is 
granted  automatically  to  individuals  who  were  permanent  resi- 
dents of  the  federation  before  the  Law  on  Citizenship  was 
passed  in  February  1992;  migrants  from  elsewhere  in  the  CIS 
(particularly  the  25  million  Russians  in  other  former  Soviet 
republics)  also  have  a  guarantee  of  Russian  citizenship  upon 
arrival,  provided  they  are  not  already  citizens  of  another  state. 
A  1993  refinement  of  FMS  regulations  added  compulsory 
annual  reregistration  and  stricter  requirements  for  proof  of 
forced  migrant  status.  It  also  modified  the  temporary  housing 
guarantee. 

As  of  mid-1996,  however,  little  of  the  system  for  carrying  out 
the  laws'  guarantees  had  been  worked  out.  Transportation  aid 
is  available  only  in  extreme  cases,  and  financial  support  at  the 
time  of  settlement  is  offered  only  to  individuals  and  families 
below  the  poverty  line.  The  FMS  reported  that,  to  comply  with 
all  aspects  of  the  refugee  law,  each  individual  should  receive 
about  US$10,000,  a  sum  far  beyond  the  resources  of  the 
agency.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Most  illegal  immigrants  enter  the  country  on  tourist  visas; 
some  take  advantage  of  leaky  borders  and  vague  visa  require- 
ments. Most  claim  to  be  in  transit  to  another  country,  usually  in 
the  West.  Profitable  businesses  have  sprung  up  smuggling  refu- 
gees through  Russia  and  then  to  the  West.  In  1994  Russian 
authorities  announced  plans  for  a  central  data  bank  to  monitor 
all  immigration  and  emigration  and  a  new  refugee  agency,  but 
no  such  system  was  in  place  in  mid-1996.  Meanwhile,  the  pros- 
pects of  moving  large  numbers  of  immigrants  to  Western  coun- 
tries diminished  with  new  immigration  restrictions  imposed 
there;  at  the  same  time,  the  United  Nations  convention  sub- 
stantially limits  Russia's  options  by  forbidding  deportation  of 
immigrants  to  "countries  of  persecution."  The  FMS  has  opti- 
mistically planned  to  deal  with  400,000  refugees  per  year,  but 
some  estimates  projected  that  as  many  as  2  million  would  immi- 
grate in  1996  alone. 

The  proportion  of  non-Russian  immigrants  declined  notice- 
ably after  1992.  In  1995  the  estimated  share  of  Russians  was  63 
percent  of  refugees  and  75  percent  of  forced  migrants,  fol- 
lowed by  overall  immigration  shares  of  7  to  9  percent  each  for 
Armenians,  Ossetians,  and  Tatars,  3  percent  for  Ukrainians, 
and  1  percent  each  for  Georgians  and  Tajiks.  Non-Slavic  immi- 
grants have  encountered  hostile  attitudes  from  most  Russian 
authorities.  For  example,  beginning  in  1993  Moscow  authori- 
ties mounted  "cleansing"  campaigns  to  rid  the  city  of  individu- 
als lacking  residence  permits;  because  immigrants  from  the 
Caucasus  and  Central  Asia  are  easily  distinguishable  from  Slavs, 
such  campaigns  have  detained  and  deported  disproportion- 
ately large  numbers  from  those  ethnic  groups.  International 
human  rights  organizations  have  criticized  Moscow  for  such 
practices. 

The  Soviet-era  internal  passport  system,  which  required  doc- 
umentary proof  of  an  individual's  place  of  residence  for  that 
person  to  receive  housing,  was  simplified  theoretically  in  Octo- 
ber 1993  to  allow  an  individual  to  take  residence  in  any  area 
without  proof  of  registration  in  that  location.  However,  local 
authorities  have  ignored  this  change,  especially  in  cities  such  as 
Moscow  that  are  chief  targets  of  migration.  In  continuing  the 
Soviet  registration  system,  local  authorities  can  restrict  hous- 
ing, education,  and  social  security  benefits  to  migrants,  what- 
ever their  origin.  In  the  mid-1990s,  strict,  "temporary"  local 
restrictions  on  initial  admittance  of  migrants  spread  rapidly  to 
most  of  the  oblast  capitals,  often  with  conditions  in  clear  viola- 


164

tion  of  the  human  rights  provisions  of  the  1993  constitution, 
with  the  official  backing  of  the  FMS.  Continued  local  limita- 
tions have  had  the  effect  of  discouraging  housing  construction 
and  employment,  hence  exacerbating  the  situation  of  nonresi- 
dents. 

Such  a  discrimination  policy  has  not  stemmed  the  tide  of 
migration  into  Russia's  cities  from  other  CIS  states  or  from 
within  the  federation.  Because  the  Soviet  system  usually 
allowed  migrants  to  eventually  register,  find  work,  and  settle  at 
their  destination,  continuation  of  that  system  also  has  contin- 
ued the  expectations  and  the  demographic  movement  that  it 
promoted.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  homeless  people  in  Rus- 
sia's cities  has  increased  dramatically  (see  Social  Welfare,  ch. 
5). 

Migration  Patterns 

The  increased  numbers  of  Russians  arriving  from  other  CIS 
nations  create  both  logistical  and  political  problems.  As  in  the 
case  of  non-Russian  refugees,  statistical  estimates  of  intra-CIS 
migration  vary  widely,  partly  because  Russia  has  not  differenti- 
ated that  category  clearly  from  the  refugee  category  and  partly 
because  actual  numbers  are  assumed  to  be  much  higher  than 
official  registrations  indicate.  Many  newly  arrived  Russians 
(like  non-Russians)  simply  settle  with  friends  or  relatives  with- 
out official  registration. 

During  Russia's  problematic  economic  transition  period,  the 
movement  of  comparatively  large  numbers  of  migrants  has  cre- 
ated substantial  social  friction,  especially  over  the  distribution 
of  scarce  urban  housing.  Nationalist  extremist  political  groups 
have  inflamed  local  resentment  toward  refugees  of  all  types. 
Friction  is  exacerbated  by  the  state's  meager  efforts  to  support 
migrant  populations.  Skilled  immigrants  show  particular 
resentment  against  a  state  that  fails  to  provide  opportunities 
and  even  enough  resources  to  survive,  and  these  people  often 
have  drifted  into  progressively  more  serious  types  of  criminal 
activity.  Local  populations  uniformly  resent  resources  provided 
to  migrants  in  their  midst,  and  they  attribute  their  own  eco- 
nomic difficulties  to  the  "strangers"  among  them,  especially  if 
those  people  are  not  of  the  same  nationality.  Particular  tension 
has  been  evident  in  North  Ossetia,  whose  17  percent  immigra- 
tion statistic  is  by  far  the  highest  in  the  Russian  Federation,  in 
Stavropol'  and  Krasnodar  territories,  and  in  Orenburg,  Kaluga, 


165 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Voronezh,  and  Saratov  oblasts,  all  of  which  have  numbers  of 
migrants  exceeding  1  percent  of  their  populations. 

By  1992  the  International  Red  Cross  had  estimated  that 
about  150,000  ethnic  Russians  had  migrated  from  CIS  states, 
and  at  the  end  of  1993  the  head  of  the  FMS  estimated  that  2 
million  Russians  and  non-Russians  had  arrived  from  the  near 
abroad  in  the  first  two  post-Soviet  years.  As  many  as  300,000  of 
the  375,000  Russians  in  Tajikistan  left  that  country  in  the  first 
years  of  the  civil  war  that  began  in  1992,  and  in  1994  more  than 
half  the  Russian  arrivals  came  from  Chechnya,  Azerbaijan, 
Georgia,  and  Tajikistan.  However,  the  structure  of  this  group 
changes  according  to  security  and  political  conditions  in  the 
CIS  states;  by  the  end  of  1994,  almost  60  percent  of  Russian 
arrivals  came  from  Kazakstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  and  Uzbekistan, 
driven  not  by  armed  conflict  but  by  local  discrimination,  and 
the  share  of  arrivals  from  the  conflict  states  had  declined  to 
one-third.  The  official  FMS  estimate  for  1995  was  963,000  peo- 
ple arriving  in  Russia  from  other  CIS  states,  slightly  lower  than 
the  1994  total.  The  number  offorced  migrants  rose  by  300,000 
in  1995,  however.  The  states  of  origin  showing  the  largest 
increases  in  1995  were  Kazakstan,  Ukraine,  and  Uzbekistan, 
and  the  Central  Asian  republics  continued  to  account  for  more 
than  half  the  total  CIS  migrants. 

Refugees  and  migrants  from  outside  the  federation  have  set- 
tled in  most  of  the  territory  of  Russia  except  for  parts  of  the  Far 
North  and  ethnic  republics  such  as  Sakha,  Chechnya,  and  Ady- 
gea.  The  largest  numbers  of  settlers  are  in  the  North  Caucasus, 
the  southern  part  of  the  chernozem  agricultural  zone  of  Euro- 
pean Russia,  the  Volga  region,  and  the  industrial  cities  of  the 
adjacent  Ural  Mountains.  Forced  migrants  show  a  decided 
preference  for  cities.  In  the  north  and  the  east,  almost  100  per- 
cent of  all  migrants  settle  in  urban  regions,  but  more  than  half 
of  migrants  to  south-central  European  Russia,  the  North  Cau- 
casus, and  the  Urals  settle  in  rural  areas.  Because  there  has 
been  no  state  program  for  distributing  forced  migrants,  they 
have  chosen  destinations  according  to  accessibility  from  their 
starting  point  and  the  location  of  relatives.  Russian  refugees 
seldom  settle  in  an  ethnic  republic  or  a  region  with  a  high  pro- 
portion of  non-Russians,  such  as  Orenburg  Oblast;  for  that  rea- 
son, their  share  of  total  refugees  in  the  republics  is  less  than  10 
percent.  Armenian  refugees,  mainly  from  the  Nagorno-Kara- 
bakh enclave  of  Azerbaijan,  are  concentrated  in  the  North  Cau- 
casus and  Saratov  Oblast,  as  well  as  the  large  cities  and 


166 


Physical  Environment  and  Population 

Kaliningrad  Oblast  on  the  Baltic  Sea.  Islamic  refugees,  mainly 
Tatar,  Bashkir,  Tajik,  Uzbek,  and  Kyrgyz,  prefer  the  republics  of 
Tatarstan  and  Bashkortostan  and  adjacent  regions  with  large 
numbers  of  Tatars.  National  groups  also  have  varying  long- 
term  intentions.  Russians  and  Tatars  tend  to  remain  perma- 
nently in  their  new  locations;  Chechens  mostly  plan  to  return 
to  their  homeland  once  conditions  improve;  and  Armenians 
and  Germans  are  predominantly  transit  migrants  en  route  to 
another  country. 

Future  Prospects 

The  Russian  Federation  possesses  a  unique  variety  and  scale 
of  geographic  features,  even  after  the  collapse  of  the  larger 
Soviet  Union,  but  it  faces  grave  problems  in  managing  its  abun- 
dant natural  resources.  Although  the  potential  remains  for 
constructive  exploitation  of  Russia's  environment,  the  eco- 
nomic and  political  condition  of  the  country  does  not  bode 
well  for  an  organized  effort  in  that  direction.  Meanwhile,  a 
large  percentage  of  Russia's  population  is  threatened  by 
numerous  grave  ecological  hazards  left  behind  by  Soviet 
regimes  as  well  as  by  the  tolerance  the  post-Soviet  government 
has  for  most  of  those  conditions.  In  the  mid-1990s,  those 
threats  combine  with  other  health  problems,  a  low  birthrate, 
and  a  declining  life  expectancy  to  give  Russia  one  of  the  least 
positive  demographic  profiles  in  the  world.

THE  RUSSIAN  STATE  HAS  EMERGED  from  the  Soviet  era 
dominated  by  an  ethnic  group,  the  Russians,  whose  language 
prevails  in  most  educational  and  government  institutions,  and 
a  religion,  Russian  Orthodoxy,  that  is  professed  by  the  vast 
majority  of  those  citizens  who  admit  to  a  religious  preference. 
In  some  respects,  Russia's  relative  homogeneity  in  language 
and  religion  is  the  result  of  the  uniformity  imposed  by  Soviet 
rule.  As  they  had  in  the  centuries  of  tsarist  rule,  Russians  con- 
tinued in  the  twentieth  century  to  occupy  a  percentage  of  gov- 
erning positions  disproportionate  even  to  their  lopsided  ethnic 
majority.  Enforced  use  of  the  Russian  language  was  a  chief 
means  of  preserving  Moscow's  authority  in  the  far-flung 
regions  of  the  Russian  Republic,  as  it  was  in  the  other  fourteen 
Soviet  republics.  Although  it  was  not  spared  the  persecution 
meted  out  to  all  faiths  practiced  in  the  Soviet  Union,  Russian 
Orthodoxy  retained  its  preeminence  among  religiously  obser- 
vant Russians  throughout  the  seven  decades  of  officially  pre- 
scribed atheism. 

In  the  1990s,  Russians  continue  to  constitute  the  largest  eth- 
nic group  in  all  but  a  handful  of  the  Russian  Federation's  nom- 
inally ethnic  republics,  but  leaders  in  many  of  the  republics 
and  smaller  ethnic  jurisdictions  have  pressed  the  central  gov- 
ernment to  grant  measures  of  autonomy  and  other  concessions 
in  the  name  of  indigenous  groups.  The  breakaway  Republic  of 
Chechnya  has  taken  the  process  to  its  furthest  extreme,  but  in 
the  mid-1990s  other  republics — in  the  North  Caucasus,  Siberia, 
and  the  Volga  and  Ural  regions — were  pushing  hard  to  achieve 
the  local  autonomy  to  which  Soviet  governments  had  only  paid 
lip  service. 

Meanwhile,  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church,  long  forced  to 
rubber-stamp  the  cultural  decisions  of  Soviet  governments,  has 
moved  rapidly  in  the  1990s  toward  a  more  balanced  partner- 
ship in  the  governance  of  Russia's  spiritual  and  secular  life. 
Post-Soviet  Western  influences  have  brought  new  variety  to  the 
spectrum  of  religious  practice,  but  the  loyalty  to  Orthodoxy  of 
average  Russians  and  of  the  Russian  government  has  become 
clear  as  the  church  has  added  millions  of  professed  believers  in 
the  1990s  and  the  government  has  sought  church  advice  on 
many  critical  decisions.  This  renewed  alliance  has  posed  a  chal- 


171 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

lenge  to  the  freedom  of  religion  nominally  guaranteed  in  the 
1993  constitution. 

The  issue  of  language  diversity  has  risen  in  parallel  with 
issues  of  local  sovereignty.  The  Russian  language  retains  its  tra- 
ditional dominance  in  official  communications  and  in  the  edu- 
cation system;  however,  the  increasing  unofficial  use  of  the 
federation's  many  minority  languages  shows  that  they  survived 
Soviet  repression  with  the  capacity  to  flourish  anew  as  the  cen- 
tral government's  power  has  diminished. 

Ethnic  Composition 

Russia  is  a  multinational  state  that  has  inherited  many  of  the 
nationality  problems  that  plagued  the  Soviet  Union.  The  last 
official  Soviet  census,  conducted  in  1989,  listed  more  than  100 
nationalities.  Several  of  those  groups  now  predominantly 
inhabit  the  independent  nations  that  formerly  were  Soviet 
republics.  However,  the  Russian  Federation — the  most  direct 
successor  to  the  Soviet  Union — still  is  home  to  more  than  100 
national  minorities,  whose  members  coexist  uneasily  with  the 
numerically  and  politically  predominant  Russians  (see  table  8, 
Appendix) . 

Besides  the  Slavs  (Russians,  Ukrainians,  and  Belarusians), 
who  account  for  about  85  percent  of  Russia's  population,  three 
main  ethnic  groups  and  a  handful  of  isolated  smaller  groups 
reside  within  the  federation.  The  Altaic  group  includes  mainly 
speakers  of  Turkic  languages  widely  distributed  in  the  middle 
Volga,  the  southern  Ural  Mountains,  the  North  Caucasus,  and 
above  the  Arctic  Circle.  The  main  Altaic  peoples  in  Russia  are 
the  Balkars,  Bashkirs,  Buryats,  Chuvash,  Dolgans,  Evenks, 
Kalmyks,  Karachay,  Kumyks,  Nogay,  and  Yakuts.  The  Uralic 
group,  consisting  of  Finnic  peoples  living  in  the  upper  Volga, 
the  far  northwest,  and  the  Urals,  includes  the  Karelians,  Komi, 
Mari,  Mordovians,  and  Udmurts.  The  Caucasus  group  is  con- 
centrated along  the  northern  slopes  of  the  Caucasus  Moun- 
tains; its  main  subgroups  are  the  Adyghs,  Chechens,  Cherkess, 
Ingush,  and  Kabardins,  as  well  as  about  thirty  Caucasus  peoples 
collectively  classified  as  Dagestani  (see  Minority  Peoples  and 
Their  Territories,  this  ch.). 

In  the  Soviet  Union,  the  Russian  Soviet  Federated  Socialist 
Republic  (RSFSR)  contained  thirty-one  autonomous,  ethni- 
cally based  administrative  units.  When  the  Russian  Federation 
proclaimed  its  sovereignty  in  the  wake  of  the  Soviet  Union's 
collapse  in  late  1991,  many  of  those  entities  also  declared  their 


172 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

sovereignty.  Of  the  thirty-one,  sixteen  were  autonomous  repub- 
lics, five  were  autonomous  oblasts  (provinces),  and  ten  were 
autonomous  regions  (okruga;  sing.,  okrug),  which  were  part  of 
larger  subnational  jurisdictions.  During  the  Soviet  era,  the 
autonomy  referred  to  in  these  jurisdictions'  official  titles  was 
more  fictitious  than  real — the  executive  committees  that 
administered  the  jurisdictions  had  no  decision-making  author- 
ity. All  major  administrative  tasks  were  performed  by  the  cen- 
tral government  or,  in  the  case  of  some  social  services,  by 
industrial  enterprises  in  the  area.  In  postcommunist  Russia, 
however,  many  of  the  autonomous  areas  have  staked  claims  to 
more  meaningful  sovereignty  as  the  numerically  superior  Rus- 
sians continue  to  dominate  the  center  of  power  in  Moscow  (see 
The  Federation  Treaty  and  Regional  Power,  ch.  7) .  Even  in  the 
many  regions  where  Russians  are  in  the  majority,  such  claims 
have  been  made  in  the  name  of  the  indigenous  ethnic  group 
or  groups. 

According  to  the  1989  Soviet  census,  Russians  constituted 
81.5  percent  of  the  population  of  what  is  now  the  Russian  Fed- 
eration. The  next-largest  groups  were  Tatars  (3.8  percent), 
Ukrainians  (3.0  percent),  Chuvash  (1.2  percent),  Bashkirs  (0.9 
percent),  Belorussians  (0.8  percent),  and  Mordovians  (0.7  per- 
cent). Other  groups  totaling  more  than  0.5  percent  of  the  pop- 
ulation each  were  Armenians,  Avars,  Chechens,  Germans,  Jews, 
Kazaks,  Mari,  and  Udmurts.  In  1992  an  estimated  7.8  million 
people  native  to  the  other  fourteen  former  Soviet  republics 
were  living  in  Russia. 

The  Russians 

The  ethnic  group  that  came  to  be  known  as  the  Russians 
sprang  from  the  East  Slavs,  one  of  the  three  groups  into  which 
the  original  Slavic  people  divided  sometime  before  the  seventh 
century  A.D.  The  West  Slavs  eventually  became  differentiated 
as  the  Poles,  Czechs,  and  Slovaks;  the  South  Slavs  divided  into 
the  Bulgarians,  Croats,  Serbs,  and  Slovenes.  The  East  Slavic 
tribes  settled  along  the  Dnepr  River  in  present-day  Ukraine  in 
the  first  centuries  A.D.  From  that  region,  they  then  spread 
northward  and  eastward.  In  the  ninth  century,  these  tribes  con- 
stituted the  largest  part  of  the  population  of  Kievan  Rus1,  the 
medieval  state  ruled  by  a  Varangian  dynasty  from  Scandinavia 
(see  The  East  Slavs  and  the  Varangians,  ch.  1). 

The  East  Slavs  became  more  politically  united  in  the  tenth 
century  when  they  adopted  Christianity  as  the  state  religion  of 


173 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Kievan  Rus'.  Nevertheless,  tribal  and  regional  differences  were 
exacerbated  in  subsequent  centuries  as  the  state  expanded, 
bringing  the  East  Slavs  into  contact  with  other  ethnic  groups 
on  their  borders.  Thus,  Baltic  and  Finno-Ugric  tribes  mixed 
with  the  East  Slavs  to  the  northwest  and  the  northeast,  respec- 
tively. By  the  time  the  state  of  Kievan  Rus1  began  disintegrating 
into  independent  principalities  in  the  twelfth  century,  the  East 
Slavs  had  begun  to  evolve  into  three  peoples  with  distinct  lin- 
guistic and  cultural  characteristics:  the  Russians  to  the  north 
and  northeast  of  Kiev,  the  Belorussians  to  the  northwest  of 
Kiev,  and  the  Ukrainians  in  the  Kiev  region  and  to  its  south  and 
southwest.  In  the  thirteenth  century,  the  invasion  of  the  Mon- 
gols brought  the  final  collapse  of  Kievan  Rus'  as  a  political 
entity,  accelerating  differentiation  and  consolidation  of  the 
three  ethnic  groups  (see  The  Golden  Age  of  Kiev,  ch.  1). 
Although  the  three  groups  remained  related  culturally,  linguis- 
tically, and  religiously,  each  of  them  also  was  influenced  by  dif- 
ferent political,  economic,  religious,  and  social  developments 
that  further  separated  them. 

Building  a  state  of  increasing  vitality  as  the  Mongol  occupa- 
tion weakened  in  the  fourteenth  century,  the  principality  of 
Muscovy  became  the  base  from  which  the  Russian  cultural  and 
political  systems  expanded  under  a  series  of  strong  rulers.  By 
the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  Russians  had  settled  the 
remote  stretches  of  Siberia  to  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  colonized 
Central  Asia  and  the  Caucasus,  becoming  in  the  process  the 
most  numerous  and  ubiquitous  of  the  Slavic  peoples  (see  Rul- 
ing the  Empire,  ch.  1). 

Minority  Peoples  and  Their  Territories 

With  a  few  changes  in  status  in  the  post-World  War  II  period, 
the  autonomous  republics,  autonomous  oblasts,  and  autono- 
mous regions  of  the  Russian  Soviet  Federated  Socialist  Repub- 
lic retained  the  classifications  assigned  to  them  in  the  1920s  or 
1930s.  In  all  cases,  the  postcommunist  Russian  government 
officially  changed  the  term  "autonomous  republic"  to  "repub- 
lic" in  1992.  According  to  the  1989  Soviet  census,  in  only  fif- 
teen of  the  thirty-one  ethnically  designated  republics  and 
autonomous  regions  were  the  "indigenous"  people  the  largest 
group.  Of  the  twenty-one  republics  existing  in  Russia  in  the 
mid-1990s,  nine  fell  into  this  category,  with  the  smallest  per- 
centages of  Russians  in  Chechnya,  Dagestan,  Ingushetia,  and 
North  Ossetia.  Each  region  designated  by  ethnic  group  is 


174 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

home  to  the  majority  of  Russia's  population  of  that  group  (see 
table  9,  Appendix). 

The  border-drawing  process  that  occurred  in  tsarist  times 
and  in  the  first  decades  of  Soviet  rule  sometimes  divided  rather 
than  united  ethnic  populations.  The  Buryats  of  southern  Sibe- 
ria, for  example,  were  divided  among  the  Buryat  Autonomous 
Republic  and  Chita  and  Irkutsk  oblasts,  which  were  created  to 
the  east  and  west  of  the  republic,  respectively;  that  population 
division  remains  in  the  post-Soviet  era.  By  contrast,  the  Chech- 
ens and  Ingush  were  united  in  a  single  republic  until  1992,  and 
smaller  groups  such  as  the  Khanty  and  the  Mansi  were  grouped 
together  in  single  autonomous  regions. 

Of  the  sixteen  autonomous  republics  that  existed  in  Russia 
at  the  time  of  the  Soviet  Union's  breakup,  one  (the  Chechen- 
Ingush  Autonomous  Republic)  split  into  two  in  1992,  with 
Chechnya  subsequently  declaring  full  independence  as  the 
Republic  of  Chechnya  and  with  Ingushetia  gaining  recognition 
as  a  separate  republic  of  the  Russian  Federation.  Three  Soviet- 
era  autonomous  oblasts  (Gorno-Altay,  Adygea,  and  Karacha- 
yevo-Cherkessia)  were  granted  republic  status  under  the  Feder- 
ation Treaty  of  1992,  which  established  the  respective  powers  of 
the  central  and  republic  governments.  Two  republics,  Chech- 
nya and  Tatarstan,  did  not  sign  the  treaty  at  that  time.  Most 
provisions  of  the  Federation  Treaty  were  overtaken  by  provi- 
sions of  the  1993  constitution  or  by  subsequent  bilateral  agree- 
ments between  the  central  government  and  the  republics. 

After  the  changes  of  the  immediate  post-Soviet  years,  twenty- 
one  nationality-based  republics  existed  in  the  Russian  Federa- 
tion and  were  recognized  in  the  constitution  of  1993  (see  table 
10,  Appendix).  They  are  Adygea,  Bashkortostan,  Buryatia, 
Chechnya,  Chuvashia,  Dagestan,  Gorno-Altay,  Ingushetia, 
Kabardino-Balkaria,  Kalmykia,  Karachayevo-Cherkessia,  Kare- 
lia, Khakassia,  Komi,  Mari  El,  Mordovia,  North  Ossetia,  Sakha 
(Yakutia),  Tatarstan,  Tyva  (Tuva),  and  Udmurtia. 

Besides  the  republics,  the  constitution  recognizes  ten  auton- 
omous regions,  whose  status,  like  that  of  the  republics,  is  based 
on  the  presence  of  one  or  two  ethnic  groups.  These  jurisdic- 
tions typically  are  sparsely  populated,  rich  in  natural  resources, 
and  inclined  to  seek  independence  from  the  larger  units  to 
which  they  belong.  The  existence  and  configuration  of  Russia's 
other  jurisdictions  are  determined  by  geographical  or  political 
factors  rather  than  ethnicity.  The  ten  autonomous  regions  are 
the  Aga  Buryat,  Chukchi,  Evenk,  Khanty-Mansi,  Koryak, 


175 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Nenets,  Permyak,  Taymyr,  Ust'-Orda  Buryat,  and  Yamalo- 
Nenets  autonomous  regions.  A  Jewish  Autonomous  Oblast 
(Yevreyskaya  avtonomnaya  oblast',  now  known  as  Birobidzhan) 
was  established  in  1934.  Russians  are  the  majority  of  the  popu- 
lation in  all  but  the  Aga  Buryat  Autonomous  Region  (whose 
population  is  55  percent  Buryats)  and  the  Permyak  Autono- 
mous Region  (whose  population  is  60  percent  Komi-Permyak, 
one  of  the  three  subgroups  of  the  Komi  people).  More  typical 
is  the  Evenk  Autonomous  Region  in  Siberia  west  of  the  Repub- 
lic of  Sakha,  where  the  Evenks  are  outnumbered  by  Russians 
17,000  to  3,000.  In  fact,  the  Evenks,  originally  a  nomadic  and 
clan-based  group  whose  society  was  nearly  destroyed  by  Soviet 
collectivization  in  the  1930s,  are  among  the  indigenous  peo- 
ples of  Russia  whose  survival  experts  fear  is  endangered. 

The  North  Caucasus 

The  region  of  Russia  adjoining  the  north  slope  of  the  Cauca- 
sus range  includes  eight  republics — Adygea,  Chechnya, 
Dagestan,  Ingushetia,  Kabardino-Balkaria,  Kalmykia,  Karacha- 
yevo-Cherkessia,  and  North  Ossetia.  The  North  Caucasus 
retains  its  historical  reputation  as  a  trouble  spot,  although  the 
majority  of  the  region's  republics  are  relatively  peaceful  and 
undeveloped. 

The  Adygh  (or  Adygey)  Autonomous  Oblast  was  established 
in  1922  as  part  of  Krasnoyarsk  Territory;  between  1922  and 
1928,  it  was  known  as  the  Cherkess  (Adygh)  Autonomous 
Oblast.  It  was  redesignated  as  the  Republic  of  Adygea  in  1992. 
A  landlocked  sliver  of  land,  Adygea  occupies  7,600  square  kilo- 
meters just  inland  from  the  northeast  coast  of  the  Black  Sea, 
reaching  southward  to  the  northern  foothills  of  the  Caucasus 
Mountains.  The  oblast  was  formed  by  the  early  Soviet  govern- 
ment for  the  Adygh  people,  who  are  one  of  three  branches  of 
the  Cherkess,  or  Circassian,  tribes — the  other  two  being  the 
Cherkess  and  the  Kabardins.  The  general  group  from  which 
these  three  peoples  descend  has  occupied  the  northern  border 
of  the  Caucasus  Mountains  at  least  since  the  Greeks  began 
exploring  beyond  the  Black  Sea  in  the  eighth  century  B.C.  The 
Adyghs,  most  of  whom  accepted  Islam  early  in  the  nineteenth 
century,  speak  a  Caucasian  language. 

In  1995  the  Adyghs  constituted  22  percent  of  the  population 
of  Adygea,  which  was  estimated  at  450,400.  The  rest  consisted 
of  68  percent  Russians,  3  percent  Ukrainians,  and  2  percent 
Armenians.  Adygea  is  the  only  Muslim  republic  of  the  Russian 


176 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

Federation  where  the  Muslim  share  of  the  population  has 
decreased  in  the  last  two  decades.  The  official  languages  are 
Russian  and  Adygh.  Rich  soil  is  the  basis  for  an  agricultural 
economy  specializing  in  grains,  tobacco,  sugar  beets,  vegeta- 
bles, fruits,  cattle,  poultry,  and  beekeeping.  Processing  of 
meats,  tobacco,  dairy  products,  and  canned  goods  is  an  impor- 
tant industry.  The  republic's  only  substantial  mineral  resource 
under  exploitation  is  an  extensive  natural  gas  and  oil  deposit. 
The  capital  city,  Maykop,  is  the  main  industrial  center,  with 
metallurgical,  machine-building,  and  timber-processing  plants. 

Chechnya  has  been  the  scene  of  the  most  violent  of  the  sepa- 
ratist movements  against  the  Russian  Federation  (see  Move- 
ments Toward  Sovereignty,  this  ch.;  Chechnya,  ch.  9;  Security 
Operations  in  Chechnya,  ch.  10).  The  Chechens  and  Ingush 
belong  to  ancient  Caucasian  peoples,  mainly  Muslim,  who  have 
lived  in  the  same  region  in  the  northern  Caucasus  Mountains 
since  prehistoric  times.  The  two  groups  speak  similar  languages 
but  have  different  historical  backgrounds.  The  Chechen- 
Ingush  Autonomous  Oblast  was  established  in  1934  by  combin- 
ing two  separate  oblasts  that  had  existed  since  the  early  1920s. 
In  1936  the  oblast  was  redesignated  an  autonomous  republic, 
but  both  ethnic  groups  were  exiled  to  Central  Asia  in  1944  for 
alleged  collaboration  with  the  invading  Germans. 

The  republic  was  reinstated  in  1957,  and  what  was  left  of  the 
original  population  was  allowed  to  return.  In  the  three  decades 
following  their  return,  the  Chechen  and  Ingush  populations 
recovered  rapidly,  accounting  in  1989  for  66  percent  of  the 
population  of  their  shared  republic.  At  that  time,  the  Chechen 
population  was  about  760,000,  the  Ingush  about  170,000.  This 
proportion  reflects  approximately  the  relative  size  of  the  two 
regions  after  they  split  into  separate  republics  in  1992.  (Ingush- 
etia occupies  a  sliver  of  land  between  Chechnya  and  North 
Ossetia;  in  1995  its  population  was  estimated  at  254,100.)  In 
1989  Russians  constituted  about  23  percent  of  the  combined 
population  of  Chechnya  and  Ingushetia,  their  numbers  having 
declined  steadily  for  decades. 

The  most  important  product  of  what  now  is  known  as  the 
Republic  of  Chechnya  (and  officially  called  the  Republic  of 
Chechnya-Ichkeria  within  the  republic)  is  refined  petroleum. 
The  capital,  Groznyy,  was  one  of  the  most  important  refining 
centers  in  southern  Russia  prior  to  its  virtual  annihilation  in 
the  conflict  of  1995-96.  Several  major  pipelines  connect 
Groznyy  refineries  with  the  Caspian  Sea,  the  Black  Sea,  and 


177

Russian  industrial  centers  to  the  north.  The  republic's  other 
important  industries  are  petrochemical  and  machinery  manu- 
facturing and  food  processing.  When  the  Chechen-Ingush 
Autonomous  Republic  split  in  June  1992,  Chechnya  retained 
most  of  the  industrial  base. 

Both  the  Chechens  and  the  Ingush  remain  strongly  attached 
to  clan  and  tribal  relations  as  the  structure  of  their  societies. 
Primary  use  of  their  respective  North  Caucasian  languages  has 
remained  above  95  percent,  despite  the  long  period  that  the 
two  groups  spent  in  exile.  Chechnya  was  fully  converted  to 
Islam  by  the  seventeenth  century,  Ingushetia  only  in  the  nine- 
teenth century.  But  the  region  has  a  two-century  history  of  holy 
war  against  Russian  authority.  When  the  indigenous  popula- 
tions were  exiled  in  1944,  Soviet  authorities  attempted  to 
expunge  Islam  entirely  from  the  region  by  closing  all  mosques. 
Although  the  mosques  remained  closed  when  the  Chechens 
and  Ingush  returned,  clandestine  religious  organizations 
spread  rapidly. 

Despite  the  close  ethnic  relationship  of  the  Ingush  and 
Chechen  peoples,  the  Ingush  opted  to  remain  within  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  after  Chechnya  initially  declared  its  sovereignty 
in  1991.  In  June  1992,  Ingushetia  declared  itself  a  sovereign 
republic  within  the  Russian  Federation.  At  that  time,  Ingushe- 
tia claimed  part  of  neighboring  North  Ossetia  as  well.  When 
hostilities  arose  between  the  Chechens  and  the  Ingush  follow- 
ing their  split,  Russian  troops  were  deployed  between  the  two 
ethnic  territories.  Ingushetia  opposed  Russia's  occupation  of 
Chechnya,  but  it  supported  the  regime  of  President  Boris  N. 
Yeltsin  on  other  issues  in  the  mid-1990s.  The  capital  of  Ingushe- 
tia is  Nazran. 

The  Republic  of  Dagestan,  formerly  the  Dagestan  (or 
Daghestan)  Autonomous  Soviet  Socialist  Republic  (Dagestan 
ASSR),  occupies  50,300  square  kilometers  along  the  western 
shore  of  the  Caspian  Sea,  from  the  border  with  Azerbaijan  in 
the  south  to  a  point  about  150  kilometers  south  of  the  Volga 
River  delta  in  the  north.  Arriving  along  the  Volga,  Russians  first 
settled  the  area  in  the  fifteenth  century,  but  Dagestan  was  not 
annexed  by  the  Russian  Empire  until  1813.  During  1920-22 
most  of  the  Dagestani  people  joined  the  Chechens  in  a  wide- 
spread revolt  against  Soviet  power;  some  of  the  secret  Islamic 
orders  that  led  the  revolt  continued  to  practice  terrorism 
through  the  Soviet  period.  Designated  an  autonomous  repub- 
lic in  1921,  Dagestan  lost  some  of  its  territory  in  1941  and  1957; 


178 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 


most  of  the  original  republic  was  restored  in  1957.  In  the  Soviet 
period,  the  Muslim  majority  suffered  severe  religious  repres- 
sion. 

Unlike  the  other  autonomous  republics,  Dagestan  does  not 
derive  its  existence  from  the  presence  of  one  particular  group. 
Besides  its  Russian  population  (9.2  percent  of  the  total  in 
1989),  Dagestan  is  home  to  an  estimated  thirty  ethnic  groups 
and  eighty  nationalities,  who  speak  Caucasian,  Iranian,  and 
Turkic  languages  and  account  for  more  than  80  percent  of  the 
population.  The  ten  non-Slavic  groups  identified  by  Soviet  cen- 
suses within  the  population  of  about  2  million  are,  in  order  of 
size,  Avars,  Dargins,  Kumyks,  Lezgins,  Laks,  Tabasarans,  Nogay, 
Rutuls,  Tsakhurs,  and  Aguls.  Colonies  of  Azerbaijanis  (4.2  per- 
cent in  1989)  and  Chechens  (3.2  percent)  also  exist.  Knowl- 
edge of  Arabic  and  the  teachings  of  Islam  are  more  widespread 
in  Dagestan  than  in  any  other  Russian  republic.  In  the  1990s, 
tension  has  existed  among  the  many  ethnic  groups,  accompa- 
nied by  a  debate  over  whether  the  republic  should  be  orga- 
nized on  a  unitary  or  federative  basis. 

The  Avars,  known  for  their  warrior  heritage,  live  mostly  in 
the  isolated  western  part  of  the  republic,  retaining  much  of 
their  traditional  village  lifestyle.  Numbering  nearly  600,000, 
the  Avars  are  by  far  the  largest  ethnic  group  in  Dagestan.  The 
Lezgins  (also  seen  as  Lezghins  and  Lezgians)  are  the  dominant 
group  in  southern  Dagestan;  because  of  the  Lezgins'  location, 
their  society  has  been  more  affected  by  foreign  cultural  influ- 
ence than  the  other  groups.  Like  the  Avars,  the  Dargins, 
divided  into  several  distinct  groups,  maintain  their  village  com- 
munities in  relative  isolation.  The  Kumyks,  the  largest  Turkic 
group  in  the  republic,  are  descendants  of  the  Central  Asian 
Kipchak  tribes;  they  inhabit  northern  Dagestan. 

The  Laks,  a  small,  homogeneous  group,  occupy  central  Dag- 
estan; their  region  was  the  original  center  of  Islam  on  the 
upper  Caspian  coast.  The  Tabasarans,  who  live  in  southern 
Dagestan,  are  strongly  influenced  by  the  more  numerous  Lez- 
gins, although  folk  practices  such  as  vendettas  persist.  The 
steppe-dwelling  Nogay  of  Dagestan,  the  second  Turkic  group  in 
the  republic,  are  descendents  of  one  of  two  Nogay  hordes  of 
the  Middle  Ages;  the  second  and  larger  group  settled  to  the 
west,  in  Stavropol'  Territory,  and  speaks  a  different  language. 
The  Tsakhurs,  Rutuls,  and  Aguls  are  small,  isolated  groups  of 
mountain  people  who  lack  a  written  language  and  largely  have 
preserved  their  traditional  social  structures.  The  capital  city, 


179 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Makhachkala,  is  located  in  southern  Dagestan,  on  the  Caspian 
Sea,  in  a  region  dominated  by  the  Lezgins. 

Most  of  the  rural  population  raises  livestock  in  the  republic's 
hilly  terrain.  Dagestan  is  rich  in  oil,  natural  gas,  coal,  and  other 
minerals;  swift  rivers  offer  abundant  hydroelectric-power 
potential.  The  polyglot  nature  of  Dagestan  has  made  linguistic 
unity  impossible;  among  the  major  groups,  only  the  Nogay  lan- 
guage is  said  to  be  declining  in  usage.  Besides  Azerbaijani  and 
Russian,  six  languages  were  recognized  as  official  languages  in 
the  late  Soviet  period. 

Kabardino-Balkaria,  the  territory  of  the  Kabardin  and  Balkar 
peoples,  is  located  along  the  north-central  border  of  Georgia 
and  the  northern  slope  of  the  Caucasus  Mountains.  Occupying 
about  12,500  square  kilometers,  the  autonomous  republic  was 
established  in  1936  after  fourteen  years  as  an  autonomous 
oblast.  In  1944  the  Balkars,  like  certain  other  North  Caucasus 
groups,  were  deported  to  Central  Asia  because  of  their  alleged 
collaboration  with  the  Nazis,  and  the  region  was  renamed  the 
Kabardin  Autonomous  Oblast.  Republic  status  was  restored  in 
1957  when  the  Balkars  were  allowed  to  return.  In  1992  both 
the  Kabardins  and  the  Balkars  opted  to  establish  separate 
republics  within  the  Russian  Federation,  using  an  ethnic 
boundary  established  in  1863,  but  the  incumbent  parliament 
of  the  republic  declared  the  separation  unlawful.  Since  that 
time,  the  issue  of  the  republic's  configuration  has  awaited  a  ref- 
erendum. In  1994  Kabardino-Balkaria  signed  a  bilateral  treaty 
with  Russia  defining  respective  areas  of  jurisdiction  within  the 
federation. 

In  the  fifteenth  century,  Crimean  Tatars  and  Ottoman  Turks 
brought  Sunni  Islam  of  the  Hanafi  school  to  the  territory  that 
is  now  Kabardino-Balkaria,  but  Muslim  precepts  have  been 
observed  rather  superficially  since  that  time.  A  small  group  of 
Christian  Kabardins  remains.  Despite  Russian  immigration  into 
the  republic,  the  Muslim  Kabardins  and  Balkars  now  constitute 
nearly  60  percent  of  the  republic's  population,  which  was  esti- 
mated at  800,000  in  1995.  Of  that  number,  48  percent  were 
Kabardin,  9  percent  Balkar,  and  32  percent  Russian,  according 
to  the  1989  census. 

Although  the  tribal  system  of  the  Kabardins  disappeared 
with  the  first  contact  with  Russians,  some  aspects  of  the  tradi- 
tional clan  system  persist  in  society,  and  family  customs  are 
carefully  preserved.  Unlike  other  ethnic  groups  in  the  region, 
the  Kabardins  were  strongly  pro-Russian  in  tsarist  times;  they 


180 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

did  not  participate  in  the  numerous  uprisings  of  Caucasus  peo- 
ples between  the  eighteenth  and  twentieth  centuries.  This 
affinity  survived  into  the  Soviet  period  despite  the  dominant 
position  of  the  aristocracy  in  Kabardin  society. 

The  economy  of  Kabardino-Balkaria  is  based  on  substantial 
deposits  of  gold,  chromium,  nickel,  platinum,  iron  ore,  molyb- 
denum, tungsten,  and  tin.  The  main  industries  are  metallurgy, 
timber  and  food  processing,  the  manufacture  of  oil-drilling 
equipment,  and  hydroelectric  power  generation.  The  repub- 
lic's capital  is  Nalchik. 

The  former  Kalmyk  Autonomous  Soviet  Socialist  Republic 
(Kalmyk  ASSR)  is  located  in  the  Caspian  Lowland,  on  the 
northwestern  shore  of  the  Caspian  Sea.  It  has  an  area  of  75,900 
square  kilometers  and  a  population  of  about  350,000  (in 
1995). 

The  Kalmyks,  also  known  as  the  Oirots,  were  seminomadic 
Mongol  people  who  migrated  from  Central  Asia  in  the  six- 
teenth century.  In  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries, 
much  of  the  Kalmyk  population  was  dispersed  or  extinguished 
by  Russian  authorities,  and  the  nomadic  lifestyle  largely  disap- 
peared during  this  period. 

The  republic  was  established  in  1920  as  an  autonomous 
oblast.  The  Kalmyk  ASSR  was  established  in  1935,  dissolved  in 
1943,  then  reconstituted  in  1958,  when  its  indigenous  people 
were  allowed  to  return  from  the  exile  imposed  in  1944  for 
alleged  collaboration  with  the  Nazis.  The  republic  officially 
changed  its  name  to  Kalmykia  in  February  1992.  In  1989  the 
republic's  population  was  45  percent  Kalmyk,  38  percent  Rus- 
sian, 6  percent  Dagestani  peoples,  3  percent  Chechen,  2  per- 
cent Kazak,  and  2  percent  German.  The  Kalmyk  economy  is 
based  on  the  raising  of  livestock,  particularly  sheep,  and  the 
population  is  mainly  rural;  the  capital  and  largest  city,  Elista, 
had  about  85,000  people  in  1989. 

Until  1992  an  autonomous  oblast,  the  Republic  of 
Karachayevo-Cherkessia  occupies  14,100  square  kilometers 
along  the  northern  border  of  Georgia's  Abkhazian  Autono- 
mous Republic.  A  single  autonomous  region  was  formed  in 
1922  for  the  Cherkess  (Circassian)  and  Karachay  peoples;  then 
separate  regions  existed  between  1928  and  1943.  The  regions 
were  recombined  in  1943  as  an  autonomous  oblast.  The 
Cherkess  converted  to  Islam  after  contacts  with  Crimean  Tatars 
and  Turks;  the  Karachay  are  an  Islamic  Turkic  group.  The 
Cherkess  are  the  remnants  of  a  once-dominant  Circassian 


181 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

group  of  tribes  that  were  dispersed,  mostly  to  the  Ottoman 
Empire,  by  the  Russian  conquest  of  the  Caucasus  region  in  the 
early  nineteenth  century.  The  original  Cherkess  now  inhabit 
three  republics,  divided  among  five  tribal  groups:  the  Adyghs, 
Kabardins,  Balkars,  Karachay,  and  Cherkess  (who  inherited  the 
original  generic  name). 

The  Balkars  and  the  Karachay  belong  to  the  same  overall 
Turkic  group,  although  the  latter  live  in  the  Republic  of 
Karachayevo-Cherkessia  immediately  west  of  Kabardino- 
Balkaria  on  the  north  slope  of  the  Caucasus  Mountains.  Like 
the  Chechens  and  the  Ingush,  the  Karachay  were  exiled  to 
Central  Asia  during  World  War  II.  The  Cherkess  and  the 
Karachay  were  reunited  when  the  latter  were  returned  from 
exile  in  1957.  Established  in  1992,  the  republic  is  mainly  rural, 
with  an  economy  based  on  livestock  breeding  and  grain  cultiva- 
tion. Some  mining,  chemical,  and  wood-processing  facilities 
also  exist.  The  population,  which  was  estimated  at  422,000  in 
1990,  was  42  percent  Russian,  31  percent  Karachay,  and  10  per- 
cent Cherkess.  The  capital  city  is  Cherkessk. 

North  Ossetia,  called  Alania  in  the  republic's  1994  constitu- 
tion, is  located  along  the  northern  border  of  Georgia,  between 
the  republics  of  Kabardino-Balkaria  and  Ingushetia.  The  Osse- 
tians  are  of  Iranian  and  Caucasian  origin,  and  they  speak  an 
Iranian  language.  In  the  first  centuries  A.D.,  Ossetia  was  occu- 
pied by  the  Alani  tribe,  ancestors  of  the  modern  Ossetians.  In 
the  thirteenth  century,  the  Tatars  drove  the  Alani  into  the 
mountains;  Russian  settlers  began  arriving  in  the  eighteenth 
century.  Russia  annexed  Ossetia  in  1861.  In  1924  North  Ossetia 
became  an  autonomous  region  of  the  Soviet  Union;  in  1936  it 
was  declared  an  autonomous  republic.  In  1992  the  campaign 
for  separation  waged  by  Georgia's  South  Ossetian  Autonomous 
Oblast  directly  to  the  south  drew  significant  support  from  com- 
patriots to  the  north.  North  Ossetia  is  the  only  Caucasus  repub- 
lic of  the  Russian  Federation  to  give  official  support  to  Russia's 
occupation  of  nearby  Chechnya. 

In  1995  the  republic's  population  was  estimated  at  660,000, 
of  which  53  percent  were  Ossetian,  29  percent  Russian,  5  per- 
cent Ingush,  2  percent  Armenian,  and  2  percent  Ukrainian. 
The  area  of  North  Ossetia  totals  about  8,000  square  kilometers. 
The  outputs  of  industry  and  agriculture  were  of  approximately 
equal  value  in  1993.  The  main  industries,  concentrated  in  the 
capital  city  of  Vladikavkaz,  are  metalworking,  wood  processing, 
textiles,  food  processing,  and  distilling  of  alcoholic  beverages.

The  main  crops  are  corn,  wheat,  potatoes,  hemp,  and  fruit. 
Lead,  zinc,  and  boron  are  mined. 

The  Northern  Republics 

Karelia  and  Komi,  the  two  northernmost  republics  of  Euro- 
pean Russia,  occupy  a  sizable  portion  of  the  latitudes  north  of 
Moscow.  Both  are  rich  in  natural  resources,  exploitation  of 
which  has  caused  considerable  environmental  damage. 

At  172,400  square  kilometers,  Karelia  is  the  fourth  largest  of 
the  autonomous  republics  of  the  Russian  Federation.  The 
republic  shares  a  border  with  Finland  from  the  Kola  Peninsula 
in  the  north  to  Lake  Ladoga  in  the  south.  The  Karelians  are  of 
the  same  ethnic  stock  as  the  Finns.  The  status  of  Karelia  has 
changed  several  times  in  the  twentieth  century.  When  Karelia 
first  became  an  autonomous  republic  of  the  Soviet  Union  in 
1923,  it  included  only  the  territory  known  as  Eastern  Karelia, 
which  had  been  Russian  territory  since  1323.  When  Western 
Karelia  was  gained  from  the  Finns  in  1940,  the  enlarged  Karelia 
became  a  full  republic  of  the  Soviet  Union,  called  the  Karelo- 
Finnish  Republic.  After  World  War  II,  the  southwestern  corner 
of  the  republic,  including  its  only  stretch  of  open-water  sea- 
coast  on  the  Gulf  of  Finland,  became  part  of  the  Russian 
Republic.  In  1956  the  regime  of  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  (in  office 
1953-64)  redesignated  the  artificial  entity,  which  never  came 
close  to  having  a  Karelian  majority,  as  the  Karelian  ASSR.  In 
1994  the  republic's  population  of  about  800,200  was  74  percent 
Russian,  only  10  percent  Karelian,  7  percent  Belarusian,  and  4 
percent  Ukrainian.  The  dominant  religion  is  Russian  Ortho- 
doxy. 

In  a  region  dominated  by  forests,  lakes,  and  marshes,  the 
Karelian  economy  is  supported  mainly  by  logging,  mining,  and 
fishing.  The  plentiful  mineral  resources  include  construction 
stone,  zinc,  lead,  silver,  copper,  molybdenum,  aluminum, 
nickel,  platinum,  tin,  barite,  and  iron  ore.  Industries  include 
timber  and  mineral  processing,  and  the  manufacturing  of  fur- 
niture, chemicals,  and  paper.  The  capital  of  Karelia  is  Petroza- 
vodsk. 

The  Republic  of  Komi  extends  westward  from  the  northern 
end  of  the  Ural  Mountains  across  the  Pechora  River  basin;  the 
republic's  westernmost  extension  is  about  250  kilometers  east 
of  Arkhangelsk  and  the  White  Sea.  The  region,  which  as  a 
republic  occupies  415,900  square  kilometers,  was  annexed  by 
the  principality  of  Muscovy  in  the  fourteenth  century,  princi-

pally  because  of  its  rich  fur-trading  potential.  In  the  eighteenth 
century,  Russians  began  exploiting  mineral  and  timber 
resources.  The  Komi  people,  a  Finno-Ugric  group,  traditionally 
have  herded  reindeer,  hunted,  and  fished.  They  nominally 
accepted  Russian  Orthodoxy  in  the  fourteenth  century.  In 
1921  the  Soviet  government  designated  an  autonomous  oblast 
for  the  Komi,  and  in  1936  the  oblast  became  an  autonomous 
republic.  The  Komi  include  three  ethnic  subgroups:  the  Perm- 
yaks,  who  inhabit  the  Permyak  Autonomous  Region  south  of 
the  republic;  the  Yazua,  who  live  in  both  the  Republic  of  Komi 
and  the  Permyak  region;  and  the  Zyryan,  who  account  for  the 
majority  of  the  republic's  Komi  population.  Altogether,  in  1994 
the  Komi  constituted  23  percent  of  the  1.2  million  people  of 
their  republic,  which  had  a  58  percent  Russian  majority.  Long 
isolated  by  the  forbidding  climate  of  their  region,  the  Komi  of 
the  north  have  intermixed  with  other  ethnic  groups  only  in 
recent  decades. 

Located  just  southwest  of  the  oil-rich  YamalTeninsula,  Komi 
has  become  an  important  producer  of  oil  and  natural  gas;  in 
1994  a  pipeline  leak  caused  extensive  damage  to  the  tundra 
and  rivers  in  the  Pechora  Basin.  Vorkuta,  in  the  far  northeast- 
ern corner  of  the  republic  near  the  Kara  Sea,  is  an  important 
Arctic  coal-mining  center.  The  capital  of  Komi  is  Syktyvkar. 

The  Volga  and  Ural  Republics 

Forming  a  crescent  from  the  middle  Volga  to  the  southern 
extent  of  Russia's  Ural  Mountains,  six  republics  represent  a 
variety  of  ethnic  and  religious  groups.  Included  in  this  group 
are  the  republics  of  Bashkortostan  and  Tatarstan,  two  of  Rus- 
sia's richest  and  most  independent  republics. 

Bashkortostan  is  the  name  assumed  in  1992  by  the  former 
Bashkir  ASSR,  which  also  had  been  called  Bashkiria.  The 
republic  occupies  an  area  of  143,600  square  kilometers  in  the 
far  southeastern  corner  of  European  Russia,  bounded  on  the 
east  by  the  Ural  Mountains  and  within  seventy  kilometers  of 
the  Kazakstan  border  at  its  southernmost  point.  The  region  was 
settled  by  nomads  of  the  steppe,  the  Turkic  Bashkirs,  during 
the  thirteenth-century  domination  by  the  Golden  Horde  (see 
Glossary;  The  Mongol  Invasion,  ch.  1).  Russians  arrived  in  the 
mid-sixteenth  century,  founding  the  city  of  Ufa,  now  the  repub- 
lic's capital.  Numerous  local  uprisings  broke  out  in  opposition 
to  the  settlement  of  larger  Russian  populations  in  the  centuries 
that  followed.  The  Bashkirs  finally  give  up  nomadic  life  in  the

Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

nineteenth  century,  adopting  the  agricultural  lifestyle  that 
remains  their  primary  means  of  support.  The  traditional  clan- 
based  social  structure  has  largely  disappeared.  The  predomi- 
nant religions  of  the  Bashkir  population  are  Islam — observed 
by  the  majority — and  Russian  Orthodoxy.  A  major  battle- 
ground of  the  Russian  Civil  War  (1918-21),  in  1919  Bashkiria 
was  the  first  ethnic  region  to  be  designated  an  autonomous 
republic  of  Russia  under  the  new  communist  regime.  The 
republic  declared  its  sovereignty  within  the  Soviet  Union  in 
1990,  and  in  1992  it  declared  full  independence.  Two  years 
later,  Bashkortostan  agreed  to  remain  within  the  legislative 
framework  of  the  Russian  Federation,  provided  that  mutual 
areas  of  competence  were  agreed  upon. 

The  republic  has  rich  mineral  resources,  especially  oil,  natu- 
ral gas,  iron  ore,  manganese,  copper,  salt,  and  construction 
stone.  The  Soviet  government  built  a  variety  of  heavy  industries 
on  that  resource  base,  and  the  republic's  economy  is  relatively 
prosperous.  The  traditional  Bashkir  occupations  of  livestock 
raising  and  beekeeping  remain  important  economic  activities. 
Bashkortostan's  population  was  about  4  million  in  1995.  In 
1989  the  major  ethnic  groups  were  Russians  (39  percent), 
Tatars  (28  percent),  Bashkirs  (22  percent),  Chuvash  (3  per- 
cent), and  Mari  (3  percent). 

The  Republic  of  Chuvashia,  the  former  Chuvash  ASSR,  occu- 
pies about  18,000  square  kilometers  along  the  east  bank  of  the 
Volga  River,  about  sixty  kilometers  west  of  the  river's  conflu- 
ence with  the  Kama  River  and  some  700  kilometers  east  of  Mos- 
cow. The  Chuvash  are  a  Turkic  people  whose  territory  first  was 
settled  and  annexed  by  Ivan  IV  (the  Terrible;  r.  1533-84)  in  the 
sixteenth  century  (see  Ivan  IV,  ch.  1).  At  that  time,  the  Chuvash 
already  were  a  settled  agricultural  people.  In  1920  Chuvashia 
became  an  autonomous  oblast,  and  in  1925  it  was  redesignated 
an  autonomous  republic.  The  republic  declared  its  sovereignty 
within  the  Soviet  Union  in  1990.  The  primary  economic  activi- 
ties are  agricultural;  grain  and  fruit  production  and  logging  are 
emphasized.  Except  for  phosphates  and  gypsum,  Chuvashia 
lacks  significant  amounts  of  minerals  and  fuels. 

The  Chuvash  speak  a  unique  Turkic  language  and  are 
believed  to  have  descended  from  the  same  stock  as  the  modern 
Bulgarians,  whose  ancestors  migrated  from  the  area.  The  Chu- 
vash also  are  the  only  Turkic  ethnic  group  in  Russia  to  have 
converted  en  masse  to  Russian  Orthodoxy.  In  1995  the  Chu- 
vash constituted  68  percent  of  the  population  of  their  republic, 


185 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

which  totaled  about  1.4  million.  Other  groups  are  Russians  (27 
percent),  Tatars  (3  percent),  and  Mordovians  (1  percent).  The 
capital  city  is  Cheboksary. 

The  Republic  of  Mari  El,  formerly  the  Mari  ASSR,  is  located 
in  the  middle  Volga  Basin  on  the  north  shore  of  the  river, 
directly  east  of  the  city  of  Nizhniy  Novgorod  (formerly 
Gor'kiy).  The  Finno-Ugric  Mari  people,  also  known  as  Chere- 
miss,  first  came  into  contact  with  the  Russians  in  the  sixteenth 
century,  when  the  major  Tatar  outpost  of  Kazan',  just  down- 
stream from  the  current  republic,  fell  to  Ivan  IV.  The  autono- 
mous oblast  of  Mari  was  established  in  1920;  an  autonomous 
republic  was  designated  in  1936.  The  economy  is  based  mainly 
on  timber  products,  agriculture,  and  machine  building;  the 
region  is  not  rich  in  mineral  resources.  In  1989  the  largest  eth- 
nic group  was  the  Russians,  who  make  up  48  percent  of  the 
population,  with  Mari  constituting  45  percent  and  Tatars  6  per- 
cent. The  predominant  religion  is  Russian  Orthodoxy, 
although  some  traces  of  animism  remain  in  the  Mari  popula- 
tion. The  total  population  in  1995  was  754,000,  about  60  per- 
cent of  whom  dwell  in  cities.  The  republic's  area  is  23,300 
square  kilometers.  The  capital  city  is  Yoshkar  Ola. 

Formerly  the  Mordovian  (or  Mordvinian)  ASSR,  Mordovia 
(or  Mordvinia)  is  located  at  the  southwestern  extreme  of  the 
middle  Volga  cluster  of  autonomous  republics  that  also 
includes  Tatarstan,  Mari  El,  Udmurtia,  and  Chuvashia.  Belong- 
ing to  the  Finno-Ugric  ethnic  group,  the  Mordovians  were  tra- 
ditionally agriculturalists,  known  especially  as  beekeepers.  The 
first  Russians  reached  the  area  in  the  twelfth  century,  and  Mus- 
covy had  taken  full  control  of  Mordovia  by  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury. After  receiving  the  status  of  autonomous  oblast  in  1930, 
Mordovia  was  declared  an  autonomous  republic  in  1934. 
Although  the  Mordovians  nominally  accepted  Russian  Ortho- 
doxy in  the  seventeenth  century,  they  retain  significant  rem- 
nants of  their  pre-Christian  beliefs,  as  well  as  national  costumes 
and  social  practices. 

In  1995  Russians  constituted  about  61  percent  of  the  repub- 
lic's population  of  approximately  964,000.  Another  33  percent 
were  Mordovians,  and  5  percent  were  Tatars.  The  total  area  of 
Mordovia  is  26,200  square  kilometers.  The  republic's  economy 
is  based  mainly  on  agriculture,  especially  the  cultivation  of 
grains,  tobacco,  hemp,  and  vegetables.  Industry  includes  some 
machine  building  and  chemical  manufacturing,  as  well  as 


186 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

enterprises  based  on  timber  and  metals.  The  capital  of  Mor- 
dovia is  Saransk. 

Located  in  the  middle  Volga  east  of  Mari  El  and  Chuvashia 
and  west  of  Bashkortostan,  Tatarstan  was  established  as  an 
autonomous  republic  in  1920  for  one  segment  of  the  large  and 
widespread  Tatar  population  of  the  Russian  Republic.  In  the 
1980s,  less  than  one-third  of  Russia's  Tatars  lived  in  the  repub- 
lic designated  for  them.  Extensive  populations  of  Tatars,  who 
are  predominantly  Muslim,  are  scattered  throughout  Russia  as 
well  as  most  of  the  other  former  Soviet  republics.  In  the  late 
Soviet  period,  numerous  Tatars  migrated  to  the  Central  Asian 
republics,  in  particular  Uzbekistan  and  Tajikistan.  The  popula- 
tion of  Tatarstan,  about  3.8  million  in  1995,  is  second  only  to 
that  of  Bashkortostan  among  Russia's  republics.  According  to 
the  1989  census,  the  population  was  49  percent  Tatar,  43  per- 
cent Russian,  4  percent  Chuvash,  1  percent  Ukrainian,  and  1 
percent  Mordovian. 

The  Tatars  are  a  Turkic  people  whose  language  belongs  to 
the  Kipchak  group  and  has  several  regional  dialects.  The 
region  of  present-day  Tatarstan  was  occupied  by  the  Mongols 
when  the  Golden  Horde  swept  across  the  middle  Volga  region 
in  the  early  thirteenth  century.  When  the  Mongol  Empire  frag- 
mented two  centuries  later,  one  of  its  constituent  parts,  the 
Tatar  Kazan'  Khanate,  inherited  the  middle  Volga  and  held  the 
region  until  its  defeat  by  Ivan  IV.  Shortly  thereafter,  Russian 
colonization  began. 

Tatarstan  has  a  diversified,  well-developed  economy  that  has 
been  the  basis  of  bold  claims  of  independence  from  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  beginning  in  1992  (see  Movements  Toward 
Sovereignty,  this  ch.).  The  first  World  Congress  of  Tatars  was 
held  in  the  republic's  capital,  Kazan',  in  June  1992.  About  1,200 
delegates  attended  from  Tatarstan  and  the  Tatar  diaspora  to 
discuss  the  republic's  status.  In  1994  a  bilateral  agreement  with 
the  Yeltsin  administration  satisfied  some  of  the  republic's 
claims  to  sovereignty. 

In  1995  the  discovery  of  a  large  oil  field  in  northern  Tatar- 
stan promised  to  boost  the  sagging  local  economy;  oil  extrac- 
tion already  was  Tatarstan's  most  important  industry.  Other 
major  industries  include  chemical  manufacturing,  machine 
building,  and  the  manufacture  of  vehicles  and  paper  products. 
The  agricultural  sector  produces  grains,  potatoes,  sugar  beets, 
hemp,  tobacco,  apples,  dairy  products,  and  livestock.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Udmurtia,  formerly  the  Udmurt  ASSR,  occupies  42,100 
square  kilometers  north  of  Tatarstan  on  the  lower  reaches  of 
the  Kama  River,  northeast  of  the  confluence  of  the  Kama  and 
the  Volga.  The  Udmurts  are  a  Finno-Ugric  people  whose  terri- 
tory was  occupied  by  the  Kazan'  Khanate  in  the  fourteenth  and 
fifteenth  centuries,  then  passed  to  Russian  control  when  Ivan 
IV  captured  Kazan'  in  1552.  Originally  established  as  the  Votyak 
Autonomous  Oblast  in  1920,  the  territory  was  renamed  for  the 
Udmurts  in  1932,  then  redesignated  an  autonomous  republic 
in  1934.  In  1995  the  republic's  population  was  about  1.5  mil- 
lion, of  which  59  percent  was  Russian,  31  percent  Udmurt,  7 
percent  Tatar,  1  percent  Ukrainian,  and  1  percent  Mari. 

Located  in  the  industrial  zone  of  the  south  Ural  Mountains, 
Udmurtia  has  a  substantial  and  diversified  industrial  economy 
that  emphasizes  locomotives  and  rolling  stock,  metallurgy, 
machine  tools,  construction  materials,  clothing,  leather,  and 
food  processing.  The  capital  city,  Izhevsk,  is  also  the  largest 
industrial  center.  The  most  important  agricultural  products  are 
grains,  vegetables,  and  livestock. 

The  Republics  of  Siberia 

Of  the  five  republics  located  east  of  the  Urals  in  Asian  Rus- 
sia, four — Buryatia,  Gorno-Altay,  Khakassia,  and  Tyva — extend 
along  Russia's  southern  border  with  Mongolia.  The  fifth,  Sakha 
(formerly  Yakutia),  is  Russia's  largest  subnational  jurisdiction 
and  the  possessor  of  a  large  and  varied  supply  of  valuable  natu- 
ral resources. 

The  Republic  of  Buryatia,  formerly  the  Buryat  ASSR,  occu- 
pies 351,300  square  kilometers  along  the  eastern  shore  of  Lake 
Baikal  and  along  the  north-central  border  of  Mongolia.  The 
Buryats,  a  nomadic  herding  people  of  Mongolian  stock,  first 
faced  colonization  by  Russian  settlers  in  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury. After  initially  resisting  this  intrusion,  most  of  the  Buryats 
eventually  adapted  to  life  in  farming  settlements,  which  contin- 
ues to  be  the  predominant  mode  of  existence.  In  1989  the 
Buryats  constituted  only  about  24  percent  of  the  republic's 
population;  Russians  made  up  about  70  percent.  The  total 
Buryat  population  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  1980s  was  about 
390,000,  with  about  150,000  living  in  the  adjacent  oblasts  of 
Chita  and  Irkutsk.  In  1994  the  population  of  the  republic  was 
1.1  million,  of  which  more  than  one-third  lived  in  the  capital 
city,  Ulan-Ude.

Buryatia  possesses  rich  mineral  resources,  notably  bauxite, 
coal,  gold,  iron,  rare  earth  minerals,  uranium,  manganese, 
molybdenum,  nickel,  and  tungsten.  Livestock  raising,  fur  farm- 
ing, hunting,  and  fishing  are  important  economic  pursuits  of 
the  indigenous  population.  The  main  industries  derive  from 
coal  extraction,  timber  harvesting,  and  engineering. 

Gorno-Altay  was  established  in  1922  as  the  Oirot  Autono- 
mous Oblast,  for  the  Mongol  people  of  that  name.  In  1948  the 
region  was  renamed  the  Gorno-Altay  Autonomous  Oblast. 
Redesignated  a  republic  in  1992,  the  region  took  its  present 
name — the  Republic  of  Gorno-Altay,  or  simply  Altay  (the  ver- 
nacular term  omits  gorno,  which  means  mountainous  in  Rus- 
sian)— in  that  year.  Occupying  92,600  square  kilometers  on  the 
north  slope  of  the  Altay  Range  on  the  northeast  border  of 
Kazakstan,  Gorno-Altay  had  a  population  in  1995  of  200,000,  of 
whom  60  percent  were  Russian  and  31  percent  Altay.  About  83 
percent  of  Russia's  total  Altay  population  lives  in  the  Republic 
of  Gorno-Altay.  The  Altay  people  comprise  several  Turkic- 
speaking  tribes  living  in  the  Altay  and  Kuznetsk  Alatau  moun- 
tains. Several  collective  terms  have  been  applied  to  the  overall 
group,  including  "Oirot,"  which  was  used  in  tsarist  times.  The 
Altays  first  came  into  contact  with  Russians  in  the  eighteenth 
century,  when  colonization  of  the  region  began.  Some  conver- 
sion to  Christianity  occurred  in  the  nineteenth  century,  but 
substantial  numbers  of  Altays  returned  to  their  previous  Mon- 
golian Lamaism  in  the  early  twentieth  century,  as  part  of  a  gen- 
eral movement  against  Russian  domination.  In  the  post-Soviet 
era,  most  of  the  republic's  population  is  Orthodox  Christian. 

The  economy  of  Gorno-Altay  is  primarily  agricultural,  sup- 
ported mainly  by  livestock  raising  in  the  hillsides  and  valleys 
that  dominate  the  republic's  landscape.  Gold  and  other  pre- 
cious and  nonprecious  minerals — especially  the  rare  earth 
minerals  tantalum  and  cesium — support  a  small  mining  indus- 
try, and  Gorno-Altay  possesses  rich  coniferous  forests.  The 
main  industries,  mostly  based  on  local  resources,  are  the  manu- 
facture of  clothing,  footwear,  and  foods,  and  the  processing  of 
chemicals  and  minerals.  The  capital  of  the  republic  is  Gorno- 
Altaysk. 

Khakassia,  an  autonomous  oblast  that  was  redesignated  an 
autonomous  republic  in  1992,  is  located  about  1,000  kilome- 
ters west  of  Lake  Baikal  on  the  upper  Yenisey  River.  Before  the 
arrival  of  the  first  Russians  in  the  seventeenth  century,  Khakas- 
sia was  a  regional  power  in  Siberia,  based  on  commercial  links

with  the  khanates  of  Central  Asia  and  with  the  Chinese  Empire. 
The  sparsely  populated  republic  (total  population  in  1995  was 
about  600,000)  occupies  61,900  square  kilometers  of  hilly  ter- 
rain at  the  far  northwestern  end  of  the  Altay  Range.  The  Kha- 
kass people  are  a  formerly  nomadic  Turkic  Siberian  group 
whose  modern-day  sedentary  existence  depends  on  sheep  and 
goat  husbandry.  Russians  now  constitute  nearly  80  percent  of 
the  population  of  Khakassia,  although  in  1989  more  than 
three-quarters  of  oblast  residents  spoke  Khakass.  The  Khakass 
population  is  11  percent  of  the  total.  The  republic  produces 
timber,  copper,  iron  ore,  gold,  molybdenum,  and  tungsten. 
The  capital  of  Khakassia  is  Abakan. 

Sakha,  whose  name  was  changed  from  Yakutia  in  1994,  is  by 
far  the  largest  of  the  republics  in  size.  It  occupies  about  3.1  mil- 
lion square  kilometers  that  stretch  from  Russia's  Arctic  shores 
in  the  north  to  within  500  kilometers  of  the  Chinese  border  in 
the  south,  and  from  the  longitude  of  the  Taymyr  Peninsula  in 
the  west  to  within  400  kilometers  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  in  the 
east.  Sakha  was  annexed  by  the  Russian  Empire  in  the  first  half 
of  the  seventeenth  century.  Russians  slowly  populated  the  val- 
ley of  the  Lena  River,  which  flows  northward  through  the  heart 
of  Sakha.  In  the  nineteenth  century,  most  of  the  nomadic 
Yakuts  adopted  an  agricultural  lifestyle. 

Formed  as  the  Yakut  Autonomous  Republic  in  1922,  Sakha 
had  a  population  of  1.1  million  in  1994,  of  which  50  percent 
were  Russian,  33  percent  Yakut,  7  percent  Ukrainian,  and  2 
percent  Tatar.  The  Yakuts  are  a  Mongoloid  people  who  origi- 
nated through  the  combination  of  local  tribes  with  Turkic 
tribes  that  migrated  northward  before  the  tenth  century. 

Climatic  conditions  preclude  agriculture  in  most  of  Sakha. 
Where  agriculture  is  possible,  the  main  crops  are  potatoes, 
oats,  rye,  and  vegetables.  The  republic's  economy  is  supported 
mainly  by  its  extensive  mineral  deposits,  which  include  gold, 
diamonds,  silver,  tin,  coal,  and  natural  gas.  Sakha  produces 
most  of  Russia's  diamonds,  and  natural  gas  deposits  are 
thought  to  be  large.  The  capital  of  Sakha  is  Yakutsk. 

Tyva  was  called  the  Tuva  ASSR  until  the  new  Russian  consti- 
tution recognized  Tyva,  the  regional  form  of  the  name,  in 
1993.  The  republic  occupies  170,500  square  kilometers  on  the 
border  of  Mongolia,  directly  east  of  Gorno-Altay.  After  being 
part  of  the  Chinese  Empire  for  150  years  and  existing  as  the 
independent  state  of  Tannu  Tuva  between  1921  and  1944,  Tyva 
voluntarily  joined  the  Soviet  Union  in  1944  and  became  an

autonomous  oblast.  It  became  an  autonomous  republic  in 
1961.  The  Tuvinians  are  a  Turkic  people  with  a  heritage  of  rule 
by  tribal  chiefs.  The  republic's  predominant  religion  is  Tibetan 
Buddhism.  In  1995  the  population  of  about  314,000  was  64  per- 
cent Tuvinian  and  32  percent  Russian. 

Tyva  is  mainly  an  agricultural  region  with  only  five  cities  and 
a  predominantly  rural  population.  The  main  agricultural  activ- 
ity is  cattle  raising,  and  fur  is  an  important  product.  Gold, 
cobalt,  and  asbestos  are  mined,  and  the  republic  has  extensive 
hydroelectric  resources.  The  capital  is  Kyzyl. 

Other  Ethnic  Groups 

Besides  the  ethnic  groups  granted  official  jurisdictions  in 
the  Russian  Republic  and  later  in  the  Russian  Federation,  sev- 
eral minority  groups  have  played  an  important  role  at  some 
stage  of  the  country's  development.  Among  those  that  exist  in 
significant  numbers  in  parts  of  post-Soviet  Russia  are  Germans, 
Koreans,  and  Roma. 

Germans 

According  to  the  Soviet  census  of  1989,  a  total  of  842,000 
Germans  lived  in  Russia.  The  remains  of  a  large  enclave  that 
was  settled  along  the  Volga  River  beginning  in  the  time  of  Peter 
the  Great  (r.  1682-1725),  the  "Volga  Germans"  were  the  ethnic 
basis  of  an  autonomous  republic  before  World  War  II.  When 
Germany  attacked  the  Soviet  Union  in  1941,  Joseph  V.  Stalin 
(in  office  1927-53)  dissolved  the  republic  and  dispersed  the 
German  population  into  Central  Asia  and  Siberia.  Although 
some  German  prisoners  of  war  remained  in  the  Soviet  Union 
after  the  war,  many  others  returned  to  Germany  in  the  decades 
that  followed.  By  1991  less  than  half  of  the  German  Russians 
claimed  German  as  their  first  language. 

Because  of  the  discrimination  suffered  by  the  Volga  Ger- 
mans, the  postwar  constitution  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Ger- 
many (West  Germany)  granted  ethnic  Germans  in  Russia  the 
right  to  citizenship  if  they  moved  to  Germany.  Russia's  German 
population  began  lobbying  for  reestablishment  of  the  prewar 
Volga  German  Autonomous  Republic  in  1990.  In  1991  Presi- 
dent Yeltsin  began  discussions  with  the  German  government 
on  creation  of  a  German  autonomous  republic  on  the  lower 
Volga  near  Volgograd.  A  protocol  of  cooperation  signed  in 
1992  arranged  for  such  a  republic  in  exchange  for  significant 
financial  aid  from  Germany.  However,  the  proposed  German 


191

enclave  encountered  strong  local  resistance  from  populations 
that  would  have  been  displaced  by  the  Germans  on  the  lower 
Volga;  official  discussion  of  the  issue  ended  in  1993.  In  1995 
about  75,000  Russian  Germans  settled  in  Germany. 

Koreans 

An  increasing  percentage  of  the  approximately  321,000 
Koreans  living  in  the  former  Soviet  republics  of  Central  Asia,  in 
particular  Uzbekistan,  began  migrating  to  the  Russian  Federa- 
tion in  1992  when  various  forms  of  discrimination  against  non- 
indigenous  peoples  increased  in  those  republics.  Most  of  these 
migrants  to  Russia  have  settled  in  Maritime  (Primorskiy)  Terri- 
tory, where  their  commercial  activities  have  competed  with 
local  merchants  and  stirred  numerous  anti-Korean  incidents. 
In  1996  about  36,000  Koreans  also  were  living  on  Sakhalin 
Island. 

When  economic  conditions  deteriorated  in  the  Democratic 
People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  in  the  mid-1990s, 
the  North  Korean  government  allowed  thousands  of  carefully 
chosen  guest  workers  to  find  manual  jobs  in  Vladivostok  and 
other  parts  of  the  Russian  Far  East.  As  North  Korean  guest 
workers  have  sought  asylum  in  Russia,  the  question  of  their 
repatriation  has  caused  Russia  a  difficult  diplomatic  problem 
in  its  relations  with  North  Korea  and  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea),  in  view  of  Russia's  intensified  efforts  to  expand 
commercial  ties  with  South  Korea  without  alienating  putative 
ally  North  Korea.  Korean  arrivals  in  Russia  from  Central  Asia 
and  from  North  Korea  receive  support  from  the  Association  of 
Ethnic  Koreans  and  from  South  Korea.  Another  Korean  emi- 
gre organization,  the  United  Confederation  of  Koreans  in  Rus- 
sia, lends  vocal  support  to  North  Korea  in  its  disputes  with 
South  Korea.  Tensions  between  the  two  Korean  populations 
were  very  strong  by  1996.  Russian  migration  officials  feared  a 
much  larger  influx  of  North  Koreans  if  the  North  Korean  gov- 
ernment collapsed. 

Roma 

The  1989  Soviet  census  indicated  that  Russia  was  home  to 
about  153,000  Roma,  commonly  known  as  Gypsies.  However, 
the  actual  size  of  the  population  is  unknown  because  many 
Roma  do  not  register  their  nationality;  experts  assume  that  the 
true  number  is  much  higher  than  the  official  estimate.  Most  of 
the  Roma  currently  in  Russia  are  descended  from  people  who 


192

migrated  from  Europe  in  the  eighteenth  century;  they  now  call 
themselves  Russka  Roma.  Another  group,  called  the  Vlach 
Roma,  arrived  after  1850  from  the  Balkans.  Other  Roma  travel 
seasonally  to  Moscow  from  Moldova  and  Romania  and  back. 
Members  of  this  group  are  often  seen  begging  on  Moscow 
streets;  this  activity  has  figured  largely  in  the  negative  stereo- 
type of  the  Roma  among  ethnic  Russians. 

Most  Roma  have  been  unable  or  unwilling  to  gain  employ- 
ment in  any  but  a  few  occupations.  In  the  Soviet  era,  metal- 
working  was  a  designated  Roma  trade,  but  street  commerce — 
selling  whatever  goods  become  available — remains  the  most 
common  occupation.  Roma  were  much  involved  in  the  black- 
market  trade  of  the  last  Soviet  decades.  Roma  musical  ensem- 
bles have  prospered  in  Soviet  and  post-Soviet  times,  but  few 
individuals  have  access  to  such  a  profession. 

In  general,  post-Soviet  Russian  society  has  included  the 
Roma  with  other  easily  identified  non-Slavic  groups,  particu-

larly  those  from  the  Caucasus,  who  are  accused  of  exploiting  or 
worsening  the  economic  condition  of  the  majority  population. 
In  the  1990s,  violence  has  erupted  between  Russians  and  Roma 
on  several  occasions.  The  wide  dispersion  of  the  Russian  Roma 
population — there  are  at  least  six  distinct  groups,  with  little 
contact  among  them — has  limited  their  ability  to  organize.  In 
the  1990s,  some  Russian  Roma  have  participated  in  interna- 
tional movements  to  gain  support  abroad.  The  various  groups 
have  widely  varying  political  views.  The  elite  musical  perform- 
ers and  intelligentsia,  for  example,  supported  the  socialism  of 
the  Soviet  Union,  but  the  wealthy  Lovari  group,  which  the  gov- 
ernment persecuted  in  Soviet  times,  is  strongly  antisocialist. 

Movements  Toward  Sovereignty 

Beginning  in  1990,  many  of  the  constituent  autonomous 
republics  and  regions,  delineated  at  various  stages  of  tsarist  or 
Soviet  control,  used  the  chaos  and  centrifugal  force  created  by 
the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  to  move  toward  local  sover- 
eignty. The  legislatures  of  most  republics  made  official  declara- 
tions of  sovereignty  over  their  land  and  natural  resources 
between  August  and  October  1990.  Although  the  declaration 
of  full  independence  by  the  Chechen  Autonomous  Republic 
was  the  most  extreme  result  of  such  moves,  some  observers  felt 
that  the  political  and  economic  stability  of  the  Russian  Federa- 
tion was  threatened  by  the  separatism  of  regions  that  were  valu- 
able because  of  their  strategic  location  or  natural  resources 
(see  The  Separatism  Question,  ch.  7).  Furthermore,  Russia, 
acutely  conscious  of  having  lost  its  "near  abroad" — the  four- 
teen republics  that  constituted  the  Soviet  Union  together  with 
the  RSFSR — could  ill  afford  the  second  blow  to  national  self- 
image  that  the  loss  of  ethnically  based  jurisdictions  would 
inflict. 

Occupying  about  three-quarters  of  the  territory  of  the 
former  Soviet  Union,  Russia  is  the  largest  country  in  the  world. 
It  never  has  existed  as  a  country  within  its  present  borders, 
however.  Intent  upon  preserving  the  territorial  integrity  of  the 
Russian  Federation,  the  government  in  Moscow  maintains  an 
uneasy  relationship  with  the  non-Russian  (and  particularly  the 
non-Slavic)  nationalities.  This  relationship  stems  from  Russian 
racial,  religious,  and  cultural  stereotypes  (for  example,  percep- 
tions of  the  dark-skinned  Muslims  in  the  midst  of  white- 
skinned,  Orthodox  Slavs),  a  historical  tendency  toward  xeno- 
phobia among  Russian  commoners  and  parts  of  the  Russian 


194 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

intelligentsia,  and  a  legacy  of  forcible  incorporation  of  various 
ethnic  and  nationality  groups  into  the  Russian  Empire  and  the 
Soviet  Union.  Further  complicating  the  relationship  is  the  fact 
that  many  of  Russia's  abundant  natural  resources  lie  in  the  ter- 
ritories of  various  regions  now  proclaiming  exclusive  sover- 
eignty over  those  resources. 

Although  some  tensions  in  ethnic  and  nationality  relations 
stem  from  a  desire  for  union  between  peoples  on  both  sides  of 
an  internal  or  international  border  arbitrarily  drawn  by  the 
tsars  or  by  Soviet  authorities,  other  motivations  also  underlie 
the  assertiveness  of  national  minorities  in  the  federation.  In  the 
more  liberal  post-Soviet  atmosphere,  people  no  longer  must 
suppress  their  anger  over  Soviet  political  and  economic  subju- 
gation and  Russification  campaigns.  Accordingly,  non-Russian 
nationalities  seek  recompense  for  long  periods  of  colonial-style 
exploitation  of  their  indigenous  resources  for  the  benefit  of 
the  regime  in  Moscow.  Another  cause  of  dissatisfaction  is  the 
perceived  failure  of  the  Russian  government  to  provide  ade- 
quate support  and  protection  for  native  schools  and  cultures. 
Finally,  the  end  of  the  Russian  government's  monopolization 
and  censorship  of  the  news  media  acquainted  minority  groups 
with  political  trends,  such  as  the  spread  of  nationalism,  with 
which  the  rest  of  the  world  has  been  familiar  for  some  time. 

Other  tensions  result  from  Russian  policies  that  non-Russian 
groups  perceive  as  discriminatory  or  confiscatory.  Examples 
include  unfair  tax  practices  and  the  refusal  of  the  Russian  gov- 
ernment to  let  various  ethnic  groups  reap  the  income  from  sale 
of  their  indigenous  products  and  natural  resources. 

Separatist  agitation  in  many  areas  of  Russia  already  had 
begun  in  the  Soviet  Union's  twilight  years.  A  full  year  before 
the  Soviet  Union's  demise,  more  than  half  the  autonomous 
republics  in  the  RSFSR  had  adopted  declarations  of  sover- 
eignty. Every  region  of  the  vast  RSFSR  was  affected  by  this 
trend,  which  was  more  an  indication  of  the  central  govern- 
ment's waning  authority — even  in  regions  relatively  close  to 
Moscow — than  it  was  an  indication  of  intent  by  those  declaring 
sovereignty. 

In  May  1990,  the  Tuva  ASSR  witnessed  civil  strife  between 
the  Russian  and  Tuvinian  populations.  Charging  that  Russia 
had  failed  to  provide  them  with  employment  opportunities  or 
suitable  housing  and  had  sought  to  eradicate  their  indigenous 
culture,  the  Tuvinians  attacked  Russian  neighborhoods,  setting 
fire  to  homes  and  forcing  about  3,000  Russians  to  flee. 


195 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


In  October  1990,  the  Chuvash  ASSR  declared  itself  a  full 
republic  of  the  Soviet  Union,  a  status  that  would  have  given  it 
equal  status  with  Russia,  Ukraine,  and  the  other  thirteen  Soviet 
republics.  Although  the  announcement  stated  that  Chuvashia 
would  remain  part  of  the  Russian  Federation,  the  republic 
would  exercise  complete  control  over  all  its  natural  resources 
and  would  make  Chuvash  equal  with  Russian  as  an  official  lan- 
guage. Also  in  1990,  the  Mari  ASSR,  about  500  kilometers  east 
of  Moscow,  proclaimed  itself  a  full  Soviet  republic  whose  natu- 
ral resources  would  become  the  exclusive  property  of  its  peo- 
ple and  whose  state  languages  would  be  Mari  and  Russian.  The 
republic  adopted  the  new  vernacular  name  "Mari  El,"  meaning 
"Mari  Territory,"  and  that  name  won  official  approval  from  the 
government  in  Moscow. 

Also  in  1990,  the  Gorno-Altay  Autonomous  Oblast  and  the 
Adygh  Autonomous  Oblast  unilaterally  upgraded  themselves  to 
autonomous-republic  status.  While  declaring 'their  intention  to 
remain  part  of  the  RSFSR,  these  jurisdictions  asserted  the  right 
to  local  control  of  their  land  and  natural  resources.  Still 
another  declaration  of  sovereignty  came  from  the  Buryat 
ASSR.  The  Buryats  declared  that  their  republic's  laws  hence- 
forth would  take  precedence  over  those  of  the  RSFSR. 

In  northwestern  Russia,  secessionist  sentiment  manifested 
itself  among  the  ethnic  minorities  of  the  Karelian  and  Komi 
ASSRs.  In  the  autumn  of  1990,  local  Karelian  authorities  pro- 
tested insufficient  food  shipments  by  refusing  to  deliver  timber 
and  paper  products  to  Russia.  Many  Karelians,  ethnically  close 
to  the  Finns,  want  their  republic  to  become  part  of  Finland. 

During  the  period  leading  to  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet 
Union,  local  officials  in  the  oil-rich  Bashkir  ASSR  (renamed 
Bashkortostan  in  1992)  declared  sovereignty,  and  the  Chukchi 
Autonomous  Region,  which  faces  Alaska  across  the  Bering 
Strait,  declared  itself  autonomous  and  demanded  control  over 
its  reindeer  and  fish  resources.  Commenting  on  the  rash  of 
separatist  activity,  an  adviser  to  President  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev 
remarked,  "It's  getting  to  the  point  where  sooner  or  later  some- 
one is  going  to  declare  his  apartment  an  independent  state." 

In  October  1991,  the  legislature  of  the  Tatar  ASSR,  some  600 
kilometers  east  of  Moscow,  adopted  a  declaration  of  indepen- 
dence from  Moscow,  and  in  1992  Tatarstan  approved  a  consti- 
tution that  described  the  republic  as  being  on  an  equal  footing 
with  the  Russian  Federation.  And,  in  what  was  to  become  the 


196 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

most  troublesome  of  the  ethnic  autonomy  movements  of  the 
1990s,  Chechnya  proclaimed  its  sovereignty  in  October  1991. 

Among  these  nominally  separatist  political  units,  the  transi- 
tion from  words  to  deeds  has  been  uneven.  In  some  cases,  eth- 
nic and  nationality  groups  appear  content  with  the  mere  form 
of  sovereignty;  in  others,  efforts  are  under  way  to  give  sub- 
stance to  the  words  of  separatism.  In  republics  such  as  Mor- 
dovia, Ingushetia,  and  Kabardino-Balkaria,  relations  with 
Russia  are  the  defining  issue  among  opposing  political  groups. 
Other  republics,  such  as  pro-Russian  Kalmykia  and  indepen- 
dence-minded Bashkortostan,  are  firmly  under  the  control  of  a 
single  leader. 

The  enormous  Republic  of  Sakha  in  north-central  Siberia, 
rich  in  diamonds  and  other  minerals,  exemplifies  the  threat 
that  secession  poses  to  the  Russian  Federation.  Sakha  has 
declared  that  its  local  laws  supersede  those  imposed  from  Mos- 
cow and  that  it  will  retain  all  revenues  generated  by  the  sale 
and  use  of  its  resources.  The  republic  also  has  accepted  sub- 
stantial direct  development  investment  from  Japan  and  China. 
Many  members  of  Sakha's  Russian  majority  have  sided  with  the 
indigenous  population  in  supporting  self-government  or  full 
independence.  Experts  believe  that  such  regions  as  Sakha, 
Tatarstan,  and  Bashkortostan  theoretically  have  sufficient  natu- 
ral wealth  to  become  viable  independent  entities.  According  to 
estimates,  these  regions'  secession  from  the  Russian  Federation 
would  deprive  Russia  of  half  of  its  oil,  most  of  its  diamonds,  and 
much  of  its  coal,  as  well  as  a  substantial  portion  of  such  indus- 
tries as  automobile  manufacturing. 

Against  the  backdrop  of  ethnic  and  nationality  tensions,  a 
tug-of-war  developed  in  the  early  1990s  over  the  respective  pow- 
ers of  the  federal  and  local  governments  in  Russia  (see  Local 
and  Regional  Government,  ch.  7).  In  March  1992,  representa- 
tives of  all  but  two  of  the  republics  (Chechnya  and  Tatarstan) 
and  most  of  the  smaller  ethnic  jurisdictions  signed  the  Federa- 
tion Treaty,  which  was  an  attempt  to  forestall  further  separat- 
ism and  define  the  respective  jurisdictions  of  central  and 
regional  government.  The  treaty  failed  to  resolve  differences  in 
the  key  areas  of  taxation  and  control  of  natural  resources,  how- 
ever. In  some  cases,  self-proclaimed  independent  entities  in 
Siberia  and  elsewhere  in  the  Russian  Federation  have  forged 
links  with  foreign  countries.  Commercial  and  cultural  accords 
between  Turkey  and  Turkic  republics  such  as  Bashkortostan 
and  Chuvashia  especially  worry  the  central  government.

The  Chechnya  Dilemma 

The  only  autonomous  jurisdictions  that  refused  to  sign  the 
1992  Federation  Treaty  were  Chechnya  and  Tatarstan,  both  of 
which  are  rich  in  oil.  In  the  spring  of  1994,  President  Yeltsin 
signed  a  special  political  accord  with  the  president  of  Tatarstan 
granting  many  of  the  Tatar  demands  for  greater  autonomy. 
Yeltsin  declined  to  carry  out  serious  negotiations  with  Chech- 
nya, however,  allowing  the  situation  to  deteriorate  into  full- 
scale  war  at  the  end  of  1994  (see  Chechnya,  ch.  9).  In  the  first 
half  of  1996,  Chechnya  continued  to  pose  the  biggest  obstacle 
to  the  quelling  of  separatism  among  the  components  of  the 
Russian  Federation. 

Chechnya  long  has  had  a  reputation  in  Russia  as  a  center  of 
organized  crime  and  corrupt  business  practices;  the  Chechen 
maftya  has  a  particularly  fierce  reputation.  The  proportion  of 
Chechens  and  other  Caucasians  in  Russia's  emerging  market 
economy  is  much  higher  than  the  representation  of  these 
nationalities  in  the  population  as  a  whole.  In  its  propaganda 
campaign  to  justify  military  action  against  Chechnya,  the  Rus- 
sian government  played  upon  the  stereotypes  of  the  criminal 
and  the  dishonest  businessman.  It  also  illustrated  the  brutal 
practices  of  the  Chechen  rebels  by  broadcasting  photos  of  the 
severed  heads  of  victims  along  the  roads  in  the  breakaway 
republic.  Meanwhile,  Russians  adopted  the  habit  of  including 
all  individuals  of  non-Slavic  appearance  under  the  heading 
"Chechen,"  widening  the  existing  strain  of  racism  in  Russia's 
society. 

The  first  Russian  invasion  of  Chechnya  occurred  during  the 
time  of  Peter  the  Great,  in  the  early  eighteenth  century.  After  a 
long  series  of  fierce  battles  and  bloody  massacres,  Chechnya 
was  incorporated  into  Russia  in  the  1870s.  In  1936  Stalin  cre- 
ated the  Chechen-Ingush  Autonomous  Republic.  In  1943, 
when  Nazi  forces  reached  the  gates  of  the  Chechen  capital, 
Groznyy,  Chechen  separatists  staged  a  rebellion  against  Russian 
rule.  In  response,  the  next  year  Stalin  deported  more  than  1 
million  Chechens,  Ingush,  and  other  North  Caucasian  peoples 
to  Siberia  and  Central  Asia  on  the  pretext  that  they  had  collab- 
orated with  the  Nazis.  The  remaining  Muslim  people  of  the 
Chechnya  region  were  resettled  among  neighboring  Christian 
communities.  Stalin's  genocidal  policy  virtually  erased  Chech- 
nya from  the  map,  but  Soviet  first  secretary  Nikita  S.  Khru- 
shchev permitted  the  Chechen  and  Ingush  peoples  to  return 
to  their  homeland  and  restored  their  republic  in  1957.

Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

The  series  of  events  since  the  Soviet  Union's  collapse  flowed 
naturally  from  the  Chechens'  long-standing  hatred  of  the  Rus- 
sians. In  September  1991,  the  government  of  the  Chechen- 
Ingush  Autonomous  Republic  resigned  under  pressure  from 
the  proindependence  Congress  of  the  Chechen  People,  whose 
leader  was  former  Soviet  air  force  general  Dzhokar  Dudayev. 
The  following  month,  Dudayev  won  overwhelming  popular 
support  to  oust  the  interim,  central  government-supported 
administration  and  make  himself  president.  Dudayev  then 
issued  a  unilateral  declaration  of  independence.  In  November 
1991,  President  Yeltsin  dispatched  troops  to  Groznyy,  but  they 
were  withdrawn  when  Dudayev's  forces  prevented  them  from 
leaving  the  airport. 

The  Chechen-Ingush  Autonomous  Republic  split  in  two  in 
June  1992.  After  Chechnya  had  announced  its  initial  declara- 
tion of  sovereignty  in  1991,  Ingushetia  joined  the  Russian  Fed- 
eration; Chechnya  declared  full  independence  in  1993.  In 
August  1994,  when  an  opposition  faction  launched  an  armed 
campaign  to  topple  Dudayev's  government,  Moscow  supplied 
the  rebel  forces  with  military  equipment,  and  Russian  aircraft 
began  to  bomb  Groznyy.  In  December,  five  days  after  Dudayev 
and  Minister  of  Defense  Pavel  Grachev  of  Russia  had  agreed  to 
avoid  the  further  use  of  force,  Russian  troops  invaded  Chech- 
nya. 

The  Russian  government's  expectations  of  a  quick  surgical 
strike  followed  by  Chechen  capitulation  were  misguided.  The 
protracted  war  in  Chechnya,  which  generated  many  reports  of 
violence  against  civilians,  ignited  fear  and  contempt  toward 
Russia  among  many  other  ethnic  groups  in  the  federation. 
Experts  believe  that  the  inability  of  Russian  forces  to  subdue 
the  Chechen  "bandits"  also  might  encourage  other  ethnic 
groups  to  defy  the  central  government  by  proclaiming  and 
defending  their  independence.  As  the  war  was  reported  to  the 
Russian  public  on  television  and  in  newspaper  accounts,  the 
rising  protests  from  Russia's  independent  news  media  and  vari- 
ous political  and  other  interest  groups  soon  came  to  threaten 
Russia's  democratic  experiment.  Chechnya  was  one  of  the 
heaviest  burdens  Yeltsin  carried  during  the  1996  presidential 
election  campaign. 

In  January  1996,  the  destruction  of  the  Dagestani  border  vil- 
lage of  Pervomayskoye  by  Russian  forces  in  reaction  to 
Chechen  hostage  taking  brought  strong  criticism  from  the 
hitherto  loyal  Republic  of  Dagestan  and  escalated  domestic  dis-

satisfaction.  Chechnya's  declaration  that  it  was  waging  a  jihad 
(holy  war)  against  Russia  also  raised  the  specter  that  Muslim 
"volunteers"  from  other  regions  and  even  outside  Russia  would 
enter  the  fray.  However,  Russia  feared  that  a  move  to  end  the 
war  short  of  victory  would  create  a  cascade  of  secession 
attempts  by  other  ethnic  minorities  and  present  a  new  target  to 
extreme  nationalist  Russian  factions. 

Some  fighting  occurred  in  Ingushetia  in  1995,  mostly  when 
Russian  commanders  sent  troops  over  the  border  in  pursuit  of 
Chechen  rebels.  Although  all  sides  generally  observed  the  dis- 
tinction between  the  two  peoples  that  formerly  shared  the 
autonomous  republic,  as  many  as  200,000  refugees  from 
Chechnya  and  neighboring  North  Ossetia  strained  Ingushetia's 
already  weak  economy.  On  several  occasions,  Ingush  president 
Ruslan  Aushev  protested  incursions  by  Russian  soldiers,  even 
threatening  to  sue  the  Russian  Ministry  of  Defense  for  damages 
inflicted. 

Meanwhile,  the  war  in  Chechnya  spawned  a  new  form  of  sep- 
aratist activity  in  the  Russian  Federation.  Resistance  to  the  con- 
scription of  men  from  minority  ethnic  groups  to  fight  in 
Chechnya  was  widespread  among  other  republics,  many  of 
which  passed  laws  and  decrees  on  the  subject.  For  example,  the 
government  of  Chuvashia  passed  a  decree  providing  legal  pro- 
tection to  soldiers  from  the  republic  who  refused  to  participate 
in  the  Chechnya  war  and  imposing  limits  on  the  use  of  the  Rus- 
sian army  in  ethnic  or  regional  conflicts  within  Russia.  Some 
regional  and  local  legislative  bodies  called  for  a  prohibition  on 
the  use  of  draftees  in  quelling  internal  uprisings;  others 
demanded  a  total  ban  on  the  use  of  the  armed  forces  in  domes- 
tic conflicts. 

The  Caucasus  Region  in  the  Federation 

The  oil-rich  region  around  Chechnya,  between  the  Black 
Sea  and  the  Caspian  Sea,  forms  a  southwestern  corridor  of  Rus- 
sian territory  bounded  on  the  west  by  Ukraine  and  the  Black 
Sea,  on  the  south  by  Georgia  and  Azerbaijan,  and  on  the  east 
by  the  Caspian  Sea  and  Kazakstan.  The  region  north  of  the 
Caucasus  includes  seven  ethnic  republics  and  four  "Russian" 
jurisdictions:  the  territories  of  Krasnodar  and  Stavropol'  and 
the  oblasts  of  Rostov  and  Astrakhan'.  With  the  thirty  ethnically 
and  linguistically  distinct  communities  of  Dagestan  the  most 
extreme  example  of  the  region's  ethnic  diversity,  much  of  the 
region  surrounding  Chechnya  is  a  cauldron  of  nationality  and

ethnic  conflicts  among  warlike  mountain  clans.  On  the  oppo- 
site slope  of  the  Caucasus,  the  former  Soviet  republic  of  Geor- 
gia likewise  includes  a  number  of  ethnic  groups,  two  of 
which — the  Abkhaz  and  the  South  Ossetians — declared  out- 
right independence  in  the  early  1990s. 

Tsarist  Russia  conducted  a  centuries-long  process  of  expan- 
sion into  the  Caucasus  region,  subduing  the  nationalities  of  the 
area  gradually  and  often  at  great  expense.  The  region  has 
assumed  particular  importance  in  the  contemporary  era 
because  of  its  oil,  its  location  astride  Russia's  transportation 
and  communications  arteries  leading  to  the  Middle  East,  and 
the  central  government's  fear  of  resurgent  Islam  along  the 
southern  border  of  the  former  Soviet  Union. 

Not  far  from  Chechnya,  a  self-styled  Confederation  of  Moun- 
tain Peoples  of  the  North  Caucasus  emerged  in  1992  in  south- 
western Russia,  where  the  borders  of  the  Russian  Federation 
abut  the  Transcaucasian  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union. 
That  confederation,  including  representatives  from  Russia's 
seven  republics  bordering  the  Caucasus,  aspires  to  establish  a 
chain  of  independent,  predominantly  Muslim  states  along  the 
federation's  southern  periphery.  It  also  has  provided  a  forum 
for  Chechen  leaders  to  enlist  support  against  Russia  and  for 
separatist  leaders  from  Abkhazia  and  South  Ossetia  to  enlist 
support  against  Georgia.  Terrorist  acts  in  Chechnya  and  else- 
where have  been  attributed  to  confederation  members. 

Responses  and  Prospects 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  relationship  of  Russia's  central  govern- 
ment to  its  regional  jurisdictions  remains  tentative;  the  Yeltsin 
administration's  failure  to  contain  separatist  movements  is  a 
favorite  target  of  the  president's  nationalist  critics.  The  Yeltsin 
government's  policy  toward  separatism  grew  from  the  theory 
that  compromises  made  with  individual  ethnic  groups  would 
satisfy  the  need  to  express  national  identity.  Such  an  approach 
rests  on  the  proposition  that  the  diverse  inhabitants  of  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  ultimately  will  identify  closely  enough  with  the 
federation  to  ensure  its  continuing  territorial  integrity,  and 
that  centrifugal  impulses  will  not  lead  Russia  to  the  fate  suf- 
fered by  the  Soviet  Union. 

Theoretically,  the  secession  of  one  component  of  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  could  encourage  the  movement  of  others  in  an 
irrational  but  uncontrollable  domino  effect.  On  the  one  hand, 
Russia's  inability  to  reverse  secession  despite  the  deployment  of 


201 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

a  large-scale  force  in  Chechnya  is  cited  by  experts  as  an  induce- 
ment to  other  national  units  to  break  away.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  fact  that  no  minority  ethnic  group  constitutes  more  than  4 
percent  of  the  federation's  population  militates  against  break- 
away jurisdicdons  attaining  the  critical  mass  and  political  lever- 
age needed  to  secede  and  function  successfully  as  independent 
nations.  In  many  respects,  Russia's  ethnic  republics,  many  of 
which  lie  deep  within  the  boundaries  of  the  federation,  remain 
heavily  dependent  on  the  center,  especially  in  economic  mat- 
ters. For  example,  under  the  conditions  of  the  mid-1990s, 
Tatarstan's  oil  cannot  be  processed  or  transported  to  the  out- 
side world  without  the  utilization  of  facilities  lying  outside  its 
borders,  in  Russia  proper.  Thus,  the  threat  of  secession  has  now 
been  established  as  a  bargaining  chip  in  the  struggle  with  the 
central  government  for  political  and  economic  advantage,  but 
it  is  a  threat  of  limited  practical  value. 

Religion 

The  chief  religion  of  Russia  is  Russian  Orthodox  Christian- 
ity, which  is  professed  by  about  75  percent  of  citizens  who 
describe  themselves  as  religious  believers.  Because  the  concept 
of  separation  of  church  and  state  never  took  root  in  Russia,  the 
Russian  Orthodox  Church,  a  branch  of  Eastern  Orthodoxy,  was 
a  pillar  of  tsarist  autocracy.  During  the  communist  era,  the 
church,  like  every  other  institution  in  the  Soviet  Union,  was 
completely  subordinate  to  the  state,  achieving  a  modus  vivendi 
by  ceding  most  of  its  autonomous  identity.  Under  the  officially 
atheist  regimes  of  the  Soviet  Union,  no  official  figures  on  the 
number  of  religious  believers  in  the  country  were  available  to 
Western  scholars.  According  to  various  Soviet  and  Western 
sources,  however,  more  than  one-third  of  the  citizens  of  the 
Soviet  Union  regarded  themselves  as  believers  in  the  1980s, 
when  the  number  of  adherents  to  Russian  Orthodoxy  was  esti- 
mated at  more  than  50  million — although  a  high  percentage  of 
that  number  feared  to  express  their  religious  beliefs  openly. 

Islam,  professed  by  about  19  percent  of  believers  in  the  mid- 
1990s,  is  numerically  the  second  most  important  religion  in 
Russia.  Various  non-Orthodox  Christian  denominations  and  a 
dwindling  but  still  important  Jewish  population  complete  the 
list  of  major  religious  groups  in  the  Russian  Federation.  In  gen- 
eral, Russians  of  all  religions  have  enjoyed  freedom  of  worship 
since  the  collapse  of  the  communist  regime  in  1991,  and  large

Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

numbers  of  abandoned  or  converted  religious  buildings  have 
been  returned  to  active  religious  use  in  the  1990s. 

The  Russian  Orthodox  Church 

The  Russian  Orthodox  Church  has  a  thousand-year  history 
of  strong  political  as  well  as  spiritual  influence  over  the  inhabit- 
ants of  the  Russian  state.  After  enduring  the  Soviet  era  as  a 
state-controlled  religious  facade,  the  church  quickly  regained 
both  membership  and  political  influence  in  the  early  1990s. 

Beliefs  and  Ritual 

Orthodox  belief  holds  that  the  Orthodox  Church  is  Chris- 
tianity's true,  holy,  and  apostolic  church,  tracing  its  origin 
directly  to  the  institution  established  byjesus  Christ.  Orthodox 
beliefs  are  based  on  the  Bible  and  on  tradition  as  defined  by 
seven  ecumenical  councils  held  by  church  authorities  between 
A.D.  325  and  787.  Orthodox  teachings  include  the  doctrine  of 
the  Holy  Trinity  and  the  inseparable  but  distinguishable  union 
of  the  two  natures  of  Jesus  Christ — one  divine,  the  other 
human.  Among  saints,  Mary  has  a  special  place  as  the  Mother 
of  God.  Russian  Orthodox  services,  noted  for  their  pageantry, 
involve  the  congregation  directly  by  using  only  the  vernacular 
form  of  the  liturgy.  The  liturgy  itself  includes  multiple  elabo- 
rate systems  of  symbols  meant  to  convey  the  content  of  the 
faith  to  believers.  Many  liturgical  forms  remain  from  the  earli- 
est days  of  Orthodoxy.  Icons,  sacred  images  often  illuminated 
by  candles,  adorn  the  churches  as  well  as  the  homes  of  most 
Orthodox  faithful.  The  church  also  places  a  heavy  emphasis  on 
monasticism.  Many  of  the  numerous  monasteries  that  dotted 
the  forests  and  remote  regions  of  tsarist  Russia  are  in  the  pro- 
cess of  restoration.  The  Russian  Orthodox  Church,  like  the 
other  churches  that  make  up  Eastern  Orthodoxy,  is  autono- 
mous, or  self-governing.  The  highest  church  official  is  the 
patriarch.  Matters  relating  to  faith  are  decided  by  ecumenical 
councils  in  which  all  member  churches  of  Eastern  Orthodoxy 
participate.  Followers  of  the  church  regard  the  councils'  deci- 
sions as  infallible. 

Church  History 

The  Russian  Orthodox  Church  traces  its  origins  to  the  time 
of  Kievan  Rus',  the  first  forerunner  of  the  modern  Russian 
state.  In  A.D.  988  Prince  Vladimir  made  the  Byzantine  variant 
of  Christianity  the  state  religion  of  Russia  (see  The  Golden  Age 


203 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

of  Kiev,  ch.  1).  The  Russian  church  was  subordinate  to  the 
patriarch  (see  Glossary)  of  Constantinople  (present-day  Istan- 
bul), seat  of  the  Byzantine  Empire.  The  original  seat  of  the 
metropolitan,  as  the  head  of  the  church  was  known,  was  Kiev. 
As  power  moved  from  Kiev  to  Moscow  in  the  fourteenth  cen- 
tury, the  seat  moved  as  well,  establishing  the  tradition  that  the 
metropolitan  of  Moscow  is  the  head  of  the  church.  In  the  Mid- 
dle Ages,  the  church  placed  strong  emphasis  on  asceticism, 
which  evolved  into  a  widespread  monastic  tradition.  Large 
numbers  of  monasteries  were  founded  in  obscure  locations 
across  all  of  the  medieval  state  of  Muscovy.  Such  small  settle- 
ments expanded  into  larger  population  centers,  making  the 
monastic  movement  one  of  the  bases  of  social  and  economic  as 
well  as  spiritual  life. 

After  the  fall  of  the  Byzantine  Empire  in  1453,  the  Russian 
Orthodox  Church  evolved  into  a  semi-independent  (autoceph- 
alous)  branch  of  Eastern  Christianity.  In  1589  the  metropolitan 
of  Moscow  received  the  title  of  patriarch.  Nevertheless,  the  Rus- 
sian church  retained  the  Byzantine  tradition  of  authorizing  the 
head  of  state  and  the  government  bureaucracy  to  participate 
actively  in  the  church's  administrative  affairs.  Separation  of 
church  and  state  thus  would  be  almost  unknown  in  Russia. 

As  Western  Europe  was  emerging  from  the  Middle  Ages  into 
the  Renaissance  and  the  Reformation,  Russia  remained  iso- 
lated from  the  West,  and  Russian  Orthodoxy  was  virtually 
untouched  by  the  changes  in  intellectual  and  spiritual  life 
being  felt  elsewhere.  In  the  seventeenth  century,  the  introduc- 
tion by  Ukrainian  clergy  of  Western  doctrinal  and  liturgical 
reforms  prompted  a  strong  reaction  among  traditionalist 
Orthodox  believers,  resulting  in  a  schism  in  the  church. 

In  the  early  eighteenth  century,  Peter  the  Great  modern- 
ized, expanded,  and  consolidated  Muscovy  into  what  then 
became  known  as  the  Russian  Empire.  In  the  process  of  rede- 
fining his  power  as  tsar,  Peter  curtailed  the  minimal  secular 
influence  of  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church,  which  was  func- 
tioning principally  as  a  pillar  of  the  tsarist  regime.  In  1721 
Peter  the  Great  went  so  far  as  to  abolish  the  patriarchate  and 
establish  a  governmental  organ  called  the  Holy  Synod,  staffed 
by  secular  officials,  to  administer  and  control  the  church.  As  a 
result,  the  church's  moral  authority  declined  in  the  eighteenth 
and  nineteenth  centuries. 

In  the  second  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  monastic 
tradition  produced  a  number  of  church  elders  who  gained  the 


204 


205 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

respect  of  all  classes  in  Russia  as  wise  counselors  on  both  secu- 
lar and  spiritual  matters.  Similarly,  by  1900  a  strong  revival 
movement  was  calling  for  the  restoration  of  church  autonomy 
and  organizational  reform.  However,  few  practical  reforms  had 
been  implemented  when  the  October  Revolution  of  1917 
brought  to  power  the  Bolsheviks  (see  Glossary),  who  set  about 
eliminating  the  worldly  and  spiritual  powers  of  the  church. 
Ironically,  earlier  in  1917  the  moderate  Provisional  Govern- 
ment had  provided  the  church  a  few  months  of  restoration  to 
its  pre-Petrine  stature  by  reestablishing  the  patriarchate  and 
independent  governance  of  the  church.  In  the  decades  that 
followed,  the  communist  leadership  frequently  used  the 
restored  patriarch  as  a  propaganda  agent,  allowing  him  to 
meet  with  foreign  religious  representatives  in  an  effort  to  cre- 
ate the  impression  of  freedom  of  religion  in  the  Soviet  Union. 

Karl  Marx,  the  political  philosopher  whose  ideas  were  nomi- 
nally followed  by  the  Bolsheviks,  called  religion  "the  opiate  of 
the  people."  Although  many  of  Russia's  revolutionary  factions 
did  not  take  Marx  literally,  the  Bolshevik  faction,  led  by 
Vladimir  I.  Lenin,  was  deeply  suspicious  of  the  church  as  an 
institution  and  as  a  purveyor  of  spiritual  values.  Therefore, 
atheism  became  mandatory  for  members  of  the  ruling  Russian 
Communist  Party  (Bolshevik).  To  eliminate  as  soon  as  possible 
what  was  deemed  the  perverse  influence  of  religion  in  society, 
the  communists  launched  a  propaganda  campaign  against  all 
forms  of  religion. 

By  1918  the  government  had  nationalized  all  church  prop- 
erty, including  buildings.  In  the  first  five  years  of  the  Soviet 
Union  (1922-26),  twenty-eight  Russian  Orthodox  bishops  and 
more  than  1,200  priests  were  executed,  and  many  others  were 
persecuted.  Most  seminaries  were  closed,  and  publication  of 
most  religious  material  was  prohibited.  The  next  quarter-cen- 
tury saw  surges  and  declines  in  arrests,  enforcement  of  laws 
against  religious  assembly  and  activities,  and  harassment  of 
clergy.  Antireligious  campaigns  were  directed  at  all  faiths; 
beginning  in  the  1920s,  Buddhist  and  Shamanist  places  of  wor- 
ship in  Buryatia,  in  the  Baikal  region,  were  destroyed,  and  their 
lamas  and  priests  were  arrested  (a  practice  that  continued  until 
the  1970s).  The  League  of  the  Militant  Godless,  established  in 
1925,  directed  a  nationwide  campaign  against  the  Orthodox 
Church  and  all  other  organized  religions.  The  extreme  posi- 
tion of  that  organization  eventually  led  even  the  Soviet  govern- 
ment to  disavow  direct  connection  with  its  practices.  In  1940  an 


206 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

estimated  30,000  religious  communities  of  all  denominations 
survived  in  all  the  Soviet  Union,  but  only  about  500  Russian 
Orthodox  parishes  were  open  at  that  time,  compared  with  the 
estimated  54,000  that  had  existed  before  World  War  I. 

In  1939  the  government  significantly  relaxed  some  restric- 
tions on  religious  practice,  a  change  that  the  Orthodox  Church 
met  with  an  attitude  of  cooperation.  When  Germany  invaded 
the  Soviet  Union  in  1941,  the  government  reluctantly  solicited 
church  support  as  it  called  upon  every  traditional  patriotic 
value  that  might  resonate  with  the  Soviet  people.  According  to 
witnesses,  active  church  support  of  the  national  war  effort  drew 
many  otherwise  alienated  individuals  to  the  Soviet  cause. 
Beginning  in  1942,  to  promote  this  alliance,  the  government 
ended  its  prohibition  of  official  contact  between  clergy  and  for- 
eign representatives.  It  also  permitted  the  traditional  celebra- 
tion of  Easter  and  temporarily  ended  the  stigmatization  of 
religiosity  as  an  impediment  to  social  advancement. 

The  government  concessions  for  the  sake  of  national 
defense  reinvigorated  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church.  Thou- 
sands of  churches  reopened  during  the  war.  But  the  Khru- 
shchev regime  (1953-64)  reversed  the  policy  that  had  made 
such  a  revival  possible,  pursuing  a  violent  six-year  campaign 
against  all  forms  of  religious  practice.  Although  the  church 
retained  its  official  sanction  throughout  that  period,  Khru- 
shchev's campaign  was  continued  less  stringently  by  his  succes- 
sor, Leonid  I.  Brezhnev  (in  office  1964-82).  By  1975  the 
number  of  operating  Russian  Orthodox  churches  had  been 
reduced  to  about  7,000.  Some  of  the  most  prominent  members 
of  the  Russian  Orthodox  hierarchy  and  religious  activists  were 
jailed  or  forced  to  leave  the  church.  Their  place  was  taken  by  a 
docile  clergy  whose  ranks  were  sometimes  infiltrated  by  agents 
of  the  Committee  for  State  Security  (Komitet  gosudarstvennoy 
bezopasnosti — KGB;  see  Glossary) .  Under  these  circumstances, 
the  church  espoused  and  propagated  Soviet  foreign  policy  and 
furthered  the  Russification  of  non-Russian  believers,  such  as 
Orthodox  Ukrainians  and  Belorussians. 

Despite  official  repression  in  the  Khrushchev  and  Brezhnev 
years,  religious  activity  persisted.  Although  regular  church 
attendance  was  common  mainly  among  women  and  the  eld- 
erly, special  occasions  such  as  baptisms  and  Easter  brought 
many  more  Russians  into  the  churches.  An  increase  in  church 
weddings  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  stimulated  the  establishment 
of  secular  "marriage  palaces"  offering  the  ceremonial  trap- 


207 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

pings  of  marriage  devoid  of  religious  rites.  When  applications 
for  seminary  study  increased  significantly  in  the  1950s,  the 
Communist  Youth  League  (Komsomol)  forced  aspiring  semi- 
narians to  endure  interrogations  that  discouraged  many  and 
that  succeeded,  by  1960,  in  sharply  reducing  the  number  of 
candidates. 

The  general  cultural  liberalization  that  followed  Stalin's 
death  in  1953  brought  a  natural  curiosity  about  the  Russian 
past  that  especially  caught  the  interest  of  younger  generations; 
the  ceremonies  and  art  forms  of  the  Russian  Orthodox 
Church,  an  inseparable  part  of  that  past,  attracted  particular 
attention,  to  the  dismay  of  the  Khrushchev  and  Brezhnev 
regimes.  Historian  James  Billington  has  pointed  out  that  in 
that  period  religious  belief  was  a  form  of  generational  rebel- 
lion by  children  against  doctrinaire  communist  parents. 

Although  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church  did  not  play  the 
activist  role  in  undermining  communism  that  the  Roman  Cath- 
olic Church  played  in  Poland  and  elsewhere  in  Eastern 
Europe,  it  gained  appreciably  from  the  gradual  discrediting  of 
Marxist-Leninist  ideology  in  the  late  Soviet  period.  In  the  mid- 
1980s,  only  about  3,000  Orthodox  churches  and  two  monaster- 
ies were  active.  As  the  grip  of  communism  weakened  in  that 
decade,  however,  a  religious  awakening  occurred  throughout 
the  Soviet  Union.  Symbolic  gestures  by  President  Gorbachev 
and  his  government,  under  the  rubric  of  glasnost  (see  Glos- 
sary), indicated  unmistakably  that  Soviet  policy  was  changing. 
In  1988  Gorbachev  met  with  Orthodox  leaders  and  explicitly 
discussed  the  role  of  religion  in  the  lives  of  their  followers. 
Shortly  thereafter,  official  commemoration  of  the  millennium 
of  Russian  Orthodoxy  sent  a  signal  throughout  Russia  that  reli- 
gious expression  again  was  accepted.  Beginning  in  1989,  new 
laws  specified  the  church's  right  to  hold  private  property  and  to 
distribute  publications.  In  1990  the  Soviet  legislature  passed  a 
new  law  on  religious  freedom,  proposed  by  Gorbachev;  at  the 
same  time,  some  of  the  constituent  republics  began  enacting 
their  own  laws  on  the  same  subject.  In  the  fall  of  1990,  a  new 
deputy  to  the  parliament  of  the  Russian  Republic,  the  Ortho- 
dox priest  Gleb  Yakunin,  guided  the  passage  of  an  extraordi- 
narily liberal  law  on  religious  freedom.  That  law  remained  in 
force  when  Russia  became  a  separate  nation  the  following  year. 
(Yakunin  was  defrocked  in  1994,  however,  for  criticizing  the 
church  hierarchy.)

Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

According  to  the  head  of  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church, 
Patriarch  Aleksiy  II,  between  1990  and  1995  more  than  8,000 
Russian  Orthodox  churches  were  opened,  doubling  the  num- 
ber of  active  parishes  and  adding  thirty-two  eparchies  (dio- 
ceses). In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the  Russian  government 
returned  numerous  religious  facilities  that  had  been  confis- 
cated by  its  communist  predecessors,  providing  some  assistance 
in  the  repair  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  structures.  The 
most  visible  such  project  was  the  building  of  the  completely 
new  Christ  the  Savior  Cathedral,  erected  in  Moscow  at  an 
expense  of  about  US$300  million  to  replace  the  showplace 
cathedral  demolished  in  1931  as  part  of  the  Stalinist  campaign 
against  religion.  Financed  mainly  by  private  donations,  the  new 
church  is  considered  a  visible  acknowledgment  of  the  mistakes 
of  the  Soviet  past. 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the  church's  social  services  also 
expanded  considerably  with  the  creation  of  departments  of 
charity  and  social  services  and  of  catechism  and  religious  edu- 
cation within  the  patriarchy.  Because  there  is  a  shortage  of 
priests,  Sunday  schools  have  been  introduced  in  thousands  of 
parishes.  An  agreement  between  the  patriarchy  and  the 
national  ministries  of  defense  and  internal  affairs  provides  for 
pastoral  care  of  military  service  personnel  of  the  Orthodox 
faith.  The  patriarch  also  has  stressed  that  personnel  of  other 
faiths  must  have  access  to  appropriate  spiritual  guidance.  In 
November  1995,  Minister  of  Defense  Grachev  announced  the 
creation  of  a  post  in  the  armed  forces  for  cooperation  with  reli- 
gious institutions. 

Among  the  religious  organizations  that  have  appeared  in  the 
1990s  are  more  than  100  Russian  Orthodox  brotherhoods. 
Reviving  a  tradition  dating  back  to  the  Middle  Ages,  these 
priest-led  lay  organizations  do  social  and  philanthropic  work. 
In  1990  they  formed  the  Alliance  of  Orthodox  Brotherhoods, 
which  organizes  educational,  social,  and  cultural  programs  and 
institutions  such  as  child  care  facilities,  hostels,  hospitals,  and 
agricultural  communities.  Although  its  nominal  task  is  to  foster 
religious  and  moral  education,  the  alliance  has  taken  actively 
nationalist  positions  on  religious  tolerance  and  political  issues. 

Public  opinion  surveys  have  revealed  that  the  church 
emerged  relatively  unscathed  from  its  association  with  the  com- 
munist regime — although  dissidents  such  as  Yakunin  accused 
Aleksiy  II  of  having  been  a  KGB  operative.  According  to  polls, 
in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  the  church  inspired  greater  trust 


209

among  the  Russian  population  than  most  other  social  and 
political  institutions.  Similarly,  Aleksiy  II,  elected  to  head  the 
church  upon  the  death  of  Patriarch  Pimen  in  1990,  was  found 
to  elicit  greater  grassroots  confidence  than  most  other  public 
figures  in  Russia.  The  political  leadership  regularly  seeks  the 
approval  of  the  church  as  moral  authority  for  virtually  all  types 
of  government  policy.  Boris  Yeltsin's  appearance  at  a  Moscow 
Easter  service  in  1991  was  considered  a  major  factor  in  his  suc- 
cess in  the  presidential  election  held  two  months  later.  Patri- 
arch Aleksiy  officiated  at  Yeltsin's  inauguration  that  year. 

Although  the  status  of  Russian  Orthodoxy  has  risen  consid- 
erably, experts  do  not  predict  that  it  will  become  Russia's  offi- 
cial state  religion.  About  25  percent  of  Russia's  believers 
profess  other  faiths,  and  experts  stated  that  in  the  mid-1990s 
the  church  lacked  the  clerics,  the  organizational  dynamism, 
and  the  infrastructure  to  assume  such  a  position. 

Other  Religions 

Article  14  of  the  1993  constitution  stipulates  that  "the  Rus- 
sian Federation  is  a  secular  state.  No  religion  may  be  estab- 
lished as  the  state  religion  or  a  compulsory  religion.  Religious 
associations  are  separated  from  the  state  and  are  equal  before 
the  law."  However,  such  a  constitutional  guarantee  existed  even 
during  the  Stalinist  era,  when  religious  oppression  was  at  its 
worst.  In  the  1990s,  the  Russian  citizenry  has  shown  that  the 
traditional,  deeply  felt  linkage  between  Russian  Orthodoxy  and 
the  Russian  state  remains  intact.  That  linkage  has  a  palpable 
effect  on  Russian  secular  attitudes  toward  religious  minorities, 
and  hence  on  the  degree  to  which  the  new  constitutional  guar- 
antee of  religious  liberty  is  honored. 

Even  before  the  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  new  open- 
ness of  Russian  society  had  attracted  religious  activists  of  many 
persuasions  from  all  over  the  world.  In  Moscow  evangelists  and 
missionaries  filled  the  airwaves  and  the  streets.  Notable  among 
them  were  German  Lutherans,  a  Roman  Catholic  missionary 
society,  Swiss  Protestant  church  groups,  the  Quakers,  the  Salva- 
tion Army,  and  the  Sisters  of  Charity,  a  Roman  Catholic  order 
of  nuns  headed  by  Mother  Teresa.  Also  present  were  members 
of  such  groups  as  the  Hare  Krishnas,  the  Unification  Church, 
and  the  Church  of  Scientology. 

The  activity  of  such  groups,  which  paralleled  Russia's  new 
enthusiasm  for  all  things  Western  in  the  late  1980s  and  early 
1990s,  had  begun  to  wane  by  1994.  However,  it  stimulated  a 


210 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

strong  reaction  among  conservative  political  and  religious 
groups.  In  November  1992,  the  influential  conservative  wing  of 
the  Russian  parliament  reacted  to  the  influx  of  non-Russian 
religious  activists  by  proposing  the  creation  of  a  so-called 
Experts'  Consultative  Council  of  church  representatives  and 
government  officials.  That  body  would  have  had  the  power  to 
tighten  the  requirements  for  registration  of  a  religious  group 
or  missionary  activity. 

After  a  flurry  of  criticism  from  international  human  rights 
and  religious  groups,  President  Yeltsin  failed  to  sign  the  consul- 
tative council  bill,  which  died  in  the  fall  of  1993.  After  a  new 
parliament  convened,  additional  versions  of  the  bill  appeared. 
In  mid-1996  a  somewhat  milder  bill  requiring  registration  of 
foreign  missionary  groups  was  passed  by  parliament.  Mean- 
while, some  eighteen  jurisdictions  in  the  federation  passed  a 
variety  of  bills  restricting  missionary  activity  or  requiring  regis- 
tration. Non-Orthodox  religious  groups  also  found  that  the 
purchase  of  land  and  the  rental  of  building  space  were  blocked 
increasingly  by  local  authorities. 

In  the  1990s,  the  Russian  Orthodox  hierarchy's  position  on 
the  issue  of  religious  freedom  has  been  muted  but  negative  in 
many  respects,  as  church  officials  have  seen  themselves  defend- 
ing Russian  cultural  values  from  Western  ideas.  Patriarch  Alek- 
siy  lent  his  support  to  the  restrictive  legislation  as  it  was  being 
debated  in  1993,  and  Western  observers  saw  an  emerging  alli- 
ance between  the  Orthodox  Church  and  the  nationalist  fac- 
tions in  Russian  politics.  In  another  indication  of  its  attitude 
toward  the  proliferation  of  "foreign"  religious  activity  in  Russia, 
the  hierarchy  has  made  little  active  effort  to  establish  contacts 
with  new  foreign  religious  groups  or  with  existing  groups,  and 
experts  see  scant  hope  that  an  ecumenical  council  of  churches 
will  be  established  in  the  near  future.  In  October  1995,  the 
Orthodox  Church's  governing  Holy  Synod  refused  to  partici- 
pate in  a  congress  of  Orthodox  hierarchs  because  the  Ortho- 
dox patriarch  of  Constantinople  had  recognized  the  Orthodox 
community  in  Estonia  and  an  autocephalous  Orthodox 
Church  in  Ukraine. 

In  1995  the  Yeltsin  administration  formed  a  consultative 
body  called  the  Council  for  Cooperation  with  Religious  Associ- 
ations, which  included  representatives  from  most  of  the  major 
denominations.  On  the  council,  the  Russian  Orthodox  and 
Roman  Catholic  churches  and  Islamic  organizations  have  two 
members  each,  with  one  representative  each  for  Buddhist,  Jew- 


211

ish,  Baptist,  Pentecostal,  and  Seventh-Day  Adventist  representa- 
tives. Council  decisions  have  only  the  status  of 
recommendations  to  the  government. 

Non-Orthodox  Christian  Religions 

The  Soviet  Union  was  home  to  large  numbers  of  Christians 
who  were  not  followers  of  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church.  Sev- 
eral other  churches  had  numerous  adherents,  including  the 
Georgian  Orthodox  Church,  the  Armenian  Apostolic  Church 
(also  called  the  Armenian  Orthodox  Church),  and  the  Ukrai- 
nian and  Belorussian  autocephalous  Orthodox  churches, 
which,  like  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church,  were  rooted  in  Byz- 
antine rather  than  Roman  Christianity.  All  of  these  faiths  like- 
wise endured  persecution  by  the  Soviet  state.  A  large  number 
of  Roman  Catholics  and  Protestants  of  various  denominations 
also  resided  in  the  Soviet  Union.  But,  because  the  majority  of 
non-Orthodox  Christians  were  concentrated  in  the  Soviet 
republics  of  Ukraine,  Belorussia,  Lithuania,  Latvia,  and  Esto- 
nia, the  representation  of  non-Russian  Orthodox  groups  in 
post-Soviet  Russia  is  much  less  than  it  was  in  the  Soviet  Union. 

The  first  West  European  Protestants  in  Russia  were  German 
Mennonites  who  arrived  in  the  second  half  of  the  seventeenth 
century.  Throughout  the  twentieth  century,  the  Baptists  have 
been  by  far  the  most  active  and  numerous  Protestant  group. 
During  the  repressive  1960s,  enthusiastic  Baptist  groups 
attracted  numerous  young  Russians  away  from  the  official 
Komsomol,  and  the  fervor  of  the  Baptists  in  a  nominally  atheist 
society  earned  them  admiration  even  among  communist  offi- 
cials. The  number  of  Protestants  in  the  Soviet  Union  was  esti- 
mated at  5  million  in  1980;  in  1993  an  estimated  3,000  Baptist 
communities  were  active  under  the  administration  of  the  Eur- 
asian Federation  of  Unions  of  Evangelical  Baptist  Christians. 
Within  that  structure,  the  Union  of  Evangelical  Baptist 
Churches  includes  about  1,000  communities  and  supports  two 
missionary  groups  and  one  publication.  Headquarters  is  in 
Moscow  The  Council  of  Churches  of  Evangelical  Baptist  Chris- 
tians was  founded  in  1961  as  a  splinter  group  from  what  was 
then  the  Union  of  Evangelical  Baptist  Christian  Churches;  it 
existed  illegally  in  Russia  until  1988  and  is  not  registered  offi- 
cially as  a  religious  group.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  council 
included  230  communities. 

Other  Protestant  groups  in  Russia  have  far  fewer  members 
than  the  Baptists.  The  Union  of  Evangelical  Christian 


212 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

Churches  was  founded  in  1992  to  continue  the  tradition  of  the 
Union  of  Evangelical  Christians,  which  had  been  founded  in 
Russia  in  1909  and  then  banned  under  communist  rule.  Pente- 
costals  first  became  active  in  Russia  in  the  early  twentieth  cen- 
tury. In  1945  one  faction  reunited  with  the  main  Baptist 
church;  then  in  1991  the  remaining  group  formed  the  Union 
of  Christians  of  the  Evangelical  Faith  Pentecostal,  which  issues 
several  publications  and  supports  missions. 

The  Seventh-Day  Adventists  formed  a  Russian  union  in  1909, 
despite  active  government  opposition.  The  church  structure 
was  largely  destroyed  during  the  Soviet  period.  Then,  after 
World  War  II,  the  Ail-Union  League  of  Seventh-Day  Adventists 
was  established.  The  union  was  inactive  from  1960  until  1990, 
when  it  was  included  in  the  international  General  Assembly  of 
Adventists.  About  600  communities  were  active  in  the  mid- 
1990s,  with  publications,  one  seminary,  one  religious  school, 
and  a  radio  broadcast  center. 

The  Jehovah's  Witnesses  appeared  in  Russia  in  1939;  their 
center  in  St.  Petersburg  and  their  missionary  work  in  Russia  are 
supported  by  the  Jehovah's  Witnesses  Center  in  Brooklyn,  New 
York.  Lutheranism  appeared  in  Russia  in  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury; in  the  mid-1990s,  only  a  few  churches  were  active.  A  few 
groups  of  Methodists,  Presbyterians,  Mormons,  and  Evangeli- 
cal Reformed  believers  also  are  active  in  Russia. 

The  size  of  the  Roman  Catholic  population  of  Russia  has  var- 
ied greatly  according  to  the  territorial  extent  of  the  country. 
For  example,  after  the  partitions  of  Poland  at  the  end  of  the 
eighteenth  century,  large  numbers  of  Polish  Catholics  became 
subjects  of  the  Russian  Empire.  Accordingly,  from  the  eigh- 
teenth century  until  1917  a  papal  legate,  or  nuncio,  repre- 
sented the  Vatican  in  St.  Petersburg.  A  Roman  Catholic 
academy  operated  in  St.  Petersburg,  and  a  mission  was  estab- 
lished in  Astrakhan*.  After  World  War  II,  the  absorption  of  the 
Baltic  states  added  many  Catholics  to  the  Soviet  Union's  popu- 
lation, but  relatively  few  of  those  individuals  entered  the  Rus- 
sian Republic.  In  1993  twenty-nine  Roman  Catholic  dioceses 
were  active  in  the  Russian  Federation,  with  those  in  the  Euro- 
pean sector  administered  from  Moscow  and  those  in  the  Asian 
sector  from  Novosibirsk. 

The  1990  establishment  of  new  Roman  Catholic  dioceses  in 
Russia  has  caused  tension  with  the  Russian  Orthodox  hierar- 
chy. The  two  churches  have  an  understanding  that  neither  will 
proselytize  in  the  "territory"  of  the  other,  so  representatives  of 


213 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


the  patriarch  have  condemned  expanding  Catholic  influence 
as  an  unwelcome  Western  intrusion. 

Islam 

In  the  1980s,  Islam  was  the  second  most  widespread  religion 
in  the  Soviet  Union;  in  that  period,  the  number  of  Soviet  citi- 
zens identifying  themselves  as  Muslims  generally  totaled 
between  45  and  50  million.  The  majority  of  the  Muslims 
resided  in  the  Central  Asian  republics  of  the  Soviet  Union, 
which  now  are  independent  countries.  In  1996  the  Muslim 
population  of  Russia  was  estimated  at  19  percent  of  all  citizens 
professing  belief  in  a  religion.  Major  Islamic  communities  are 
concentrated  among  the  minority  nationalities  residing 
between  the  Black  Sea  and  the  Caspian  Sea:  the  Adyghs, 
Balkars,  Bashkirs,  Chechens,  Cherkess,  Ingush,  Kabardins, 
Karachay,  and  numerous  Dagestani  nationalities.  In  the  middle 
Volga  Basin  are  large  populations  of  Tatars,  Udmurts,  and  Chu- 
vash, most  of  whom  are  Muslims.  Many  Muslims  also  reside  in 
Ul'yanovsk,  Samara,  Nizhniy  Novgorod,  Moscow,  Perm',  and 
Leningrad  oblasts  (see  Ethnic  Composition,  this  ch.). 

Virtually  all  the  Muslims  in  Russia  adhere  to  the  Sunni 
branch  of  Islam.  In  a  few  areas,  notably  Chechnya,  there  is  a 
tradition  of  Sufism,  a  mystical  variety  of  Islam  that  stresses  the 
individual's  search  for  union  with  God.  Sufi  rituals,  practiced  to 
give  the  Chechens  spiritual  strength  to  resist  foreign  oppres- 
sion, became  legendary  among  Russian  troops  fighting  the 
Chechens  during  tsarist  times. 

Relations  between  the  Russian  government  and  Muslim  ele- 
ments of  the  population  have  been  marked  by  mistrust  and  sus- 
picion. In  1992,  for  example,  Sheikh  Ravil  Gainurtdin,  the 
imam  of  the  Moscow  mosque,  complained  that  "our  country 
[Russia]  still  retains  the  ideology  of  the  tsarist  empire,  which 
believed  that  the  Orthodox  faith  alone  should  be  a  privileged 
religion,  that  is,  the  state  religion."  The  Russian  government, 
for  its  part,  fears  the  rise  of  political  Islam  of  the  violent  sort 
that  Russians  witnessed  in  the  1980s  firsthand  in  Afghanistan 
and  secondhand  in  Iran.  Government  fears  were  fueled  by  a 
1992  conference  held  in  Saratov  by  the  Tajikistan-based  Islamic 
Renaissance  Party.  Representatives  attended  from  several  newly 
independent  Central  Asian  republics,  from  Azerbaijan,  and 
from  several  autonomous  jurisdictions  of  Russia,  including  the 
secessionist-minded  autonomous  republics  of  Tatarstan  and 
Bashkortostan.  The  meeting's  pan-Islamic  complexion  created 


214

concern  in  Moscow  about  the  possible  spread  of  radical  Islam 
into  Russia  from  the  new  Muslim  states  along  the  periphery  of 
the  former  Soviet  Union.  For  that  reason,  the  Russian  govern- 
ment has  provided  extensive  military  and  political  support  to 
secular  leaders  of  the  five  Central  Asian  republics,  all  of  whom 
are  publicly  opposed  to  political  Islam.  By  the  mid-1990s,  the 
putative  Islamic  threat  was  a  standard  justification  for  radical 
nationalist  insistence  that  Russia  regain  control  of  its  "near 
abroad"  (see  The  Near  Abroad,  ch.  8). 

The  struggle  to  delineate  the  respective  powers  of  the  fed- 
eral and  local  governments  in  Russia  also  has  influenced  Rus- 
sian relations  with  the  Islamic  community.  The  Russian 
Federation  inherited  two  of  the  four  spiritual  boards,  or  mufti- 
ates,  created  during  the  Stalinist  era  to  supervise  the  religious 
activities  of  Islamic  groups  in  various  parts  of  the  Soviet  Union; 
the  other  two  are  located  in  Tashkent  and  Baku.  One  of  the 
two  Russian  boards  has  jurisdiction  in  European  Russia  and 
Siberia,  and  the  other  is  responsible  for  the  Muslim  enclaves  of 
the  North  Caucasus  and  Transcaspian  regions.  In  1992  several 
Muslim  associations  withdrew  from  the  latter  muftiate  and 
attempted  to  establish  their  own  spiritual  boards.  Later  that 


215 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

year,  Tatarstan  and  Bashkortostan  withdrew  recognition  from 
the  muftiate  for  European  Russia  and  Siberia  and  created  their 
own  muftiate. 

There  is  much  evidence  of  official  conciliation  toward  Islam 
in  Russia  in  the  1990s.  The  number  of  Muslims  allowed  to 
make  pilgrimages  to  Mecca  increased  sharply  after  the  virtual 
embargo  of  the  Soviet  era  ended  in  1990.  Copies  of  the  Quran 
(Koran)  are  readily  available,  and  many  mosques  are  being 
built  in  regions  with  large  Muslim  populations.  In  1995  the 
newly  established  Union  of  Muslims  of  Russia,  led  by  Imam 
Khatyb  Mukaddas  of  Tatarstan,  began  organizing  a  movement 
aimed  at  improving  interethnic  understanding  and  ending 
Russians'  lingering  conception  of  Islam  as  an  extremist  reli- 
gion. The  Union  of  Muslims  of  Russia  is  the  direct  successor  to 
the  pre-World  War  I  Union  of  Muslims,  which  had  its  own  fac- 
tion in  the  Russian  Duma  (see  Glossary).  The  postcommunist 
union  has  formed  a  political  party,  the  Nur  All-Russia  Muslim 
Public  Movement,  which  acts  in  close  coordination  with  Mus- 
lim clergy  to  defend  the  political,  economic,  and  cultural  rights 
of  Muslims  and  other  minorities.  The  Islamic  Cultural  Center 
of  Russia,  which  includes  a  medrese  (religious  school),  opened 
in  Moscow  in  1991.  The  Ash-Shafii  Islamic  Institute  in  Dagestan 
is  the  only  such  research  institution  in  Russia.  In  the  1990s,  the 
number  of  Islamic  publications  has  increased.  Among  them 
are  two  magazines  in  Russian,  Ekho  Kavkaza  and  Islamskiy  vest- 
nik,  and  the  Russian-language  newspaper  Islamskiye  novosti, 
which  is  published  in  Makhachkala,  Dagestan. 

Judaism 

Judaism  began  to  have  an  influence  on  Russian  culture  and 
social  attitudes  in  the  sixteenth  century,  shortly  after  the  expul- 
sion of  the  Jews  from  Spain  by  Queen  Isabella  in  1492.  In  the 
centuries  that  followed,  large  numbers  of  Jews  migrated  to 
Poland,  Lithuania,  Ukraine,  and  Belorussia.  Much  of  the  anti- 
Semitism  that  developed  subsequently  among  Russian  peasants 
came  from  the  identification  of  Jews  with  activities  such  as  tax 
collection  and  the  administration  of  the  large  estates  on  which 
the  peasants  worked,  two  of  the  few  occupations  Jews  were 
allowed  to  pursue  in  tsarist  Russia.  Anti-Semitism  followed  the 
Jews  from  Western  Europe,  and  already  in  the  sixteenth  cen- 
tury the  culture  of  Muscovy  contained  a  strong  element  of  that 
attitude.  When  Poland  was  partitioned  at  the  end  of  the  eigh- 
teenth century,  large  numbers  of  Jews  came  into  the  Russian

Empire,  giving  Russia  the  largest  Jewish  population  (about  1.5 
million)  in  the  world.  For  the  next  120  years,  tsarist  govern- 
ments restricted  Jewish  settlements  to  what  was  called  the  Pale 
of  Settlement,  established  by  Catherine  II  in  1792  to  include 
portions  of  the  Baltic  states,  Ukraine,  Belorussia,  and  the 
northern  shore  of  the  Black  Sea. 

During  the  nineteenth  century,  restrictions  on  the  Jewish 
population  were  alternately  eased  and  tightened.  Alexander  II 
(r.  1855-81),  for  example,  relaxed  restrictions  on  settlement, 
education,  and  employment.  Alexander's  assassination  in  1881 
brought  reimposition  of  all  previous  restrictions,  which  then 
remained  in  force  until  1917.  During  that  period,  Jews  were 
beaten  and  killed  and  their  property  destroyed  in  government- 
sanctioned  pogroms  led  by  a  group  called  the  Black  Hundreds. 
Despite  repressive  conditions  in  Russia  and  high  levels  of  emi- 
gration to  the  United  States,  the  Jewish  population  grew  rap- 
idly in  the  nineteenth  century;  by  the  beginning  of  World  War 
I,  an  estimated  5.2  million  Jews  lived  in  Russia. 

Within  their  areas  of  settlement,  the  Russian  Jews  developed 
a  flourishing  culture,  and  many  of  them  became  active  in  the 
revolutionary  movements  that  sprang  up  in  the  late  nineteenth 
and  early  twentieth  centuries.  But  much  of  the  long  period  of 
violence  that  began  with  World  War  I  in  1914  and  continued 
until  the  Civil  War  ended  in  1921  took  place  in  the  regions 
inhabited  by  the  Jews,  many  of  whom  were  killed  indiscrimi- 
nately by  the  various  armies  struggling  for  power.  After  World 
War  I,  parts  of  the  western  territory  of  the  former  Russian 
Empire  became  the  independent  nations  of  Lithuania,  Latvia, 
and  Poland,  a  development  that  left  many  Russian  Jews  outside 
the  borders  of  what  now  was  the  Soviet  Union.  By  1922  Russia's 
Jewish  population  had  been  reduced  by  more  than  half. 

In  the  early  years  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Jews  gained  much 
more  freedom  to  enter  the  mainstream  of  Russian  society. 
Although  relatively  few  supported  the  explicit  program  of  the 
Bolsheviks,  the  majority  expected  that  the  new  state  would 
offer  much  greater  ethnic  and  religious  tolerance  than  had  the 
tsarist  system.  In  the  1920s,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Jews  were 
integrated  into  Soviet  economic  and  cultural  life,  and  many 
acquired  prominent  positions.  Among  them  were  communist 
leaders  Leon  Trotsky,  Lazar  Kaganovich,  Maksim  Litvinov,  Lev 
Kamenev,  and  Grigoriy  Zinov'yev;  writers  Isaak  Babel', 
Veniamin  Kaverin,  Boris  Pasternak,  Osip  Mandel'shtam,  and 
Ilya  Ehrenburg;  and  cinematographer  Sergey  Eisenstein.  Spe-

cial  Jewish  sections  were  established  in  the  All-Union  Commu- 
nist Party  (Bolshevik).  Then,  in  the  1930s  the  purges  initiated 
by  Stalin  targeted  groups  for  their  ethnic  and  social  identities. 
As  non-Russians  stereotyped  as  intellectuals,  the  Jews  were  tar- 
gets in  two  categories.  As  part  of  Soviet  ethnic  policy,  the  Jewish 
Autonomous  Oblast  (Yevreyskaya  avtonomnaya  oblast',  later 
called  Birobidzhan)  was  established  in  1934.  But  the  oblast 
never  was  the  center  of  the  Soviet  Union's  Jewish  population. 
Only  about  50,000  Jews  settled  in  this  jurisdiction,  which  is 
located  along  the  Amur  River  in  the  farthest  reaches  of  the 
Soviet  Far  East. 

When  Nazi  Germany  invaded  the  Soviet  Union  in  1941, 
about  2.5  million  Jews  were  killed  by  the  Germans  or  by  their 
Slavic  collaborators.  Jews  who  escaped  to  areas  untouched  by 
the  Nazis  often  suffered  from  the  resentment  of  local  popula- 
tions who  envied  their  education  or  supposed  wealth. 

Between  World  War  II  and  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union, 
Russia's  Jewish  population  declined  steadily,  thanks  to  emigra- 
tion, a  low  birth  rate,  intermarriage,  and  concealment  of  iden- 
tity. In  1989  the  official  total  was  537,000.  Of  the  number 
remaining  at  that  point,  only  about  9,000  were  living  in  the  Jew- 
ish Autonomous  Oblast,  and,  by  1995,  only  an  estimated  1,500 
Jews  remained  in  the  oblast.  The  Jews  of  Russia  always  have 
been  concentrated  overwhelmingly  in  the  larger  cities,  espe- 
cially Moscow,  St.  Petersburg,  and  Odessa — partly  because  of 
the  traditional  ban,  continued  from  tsarist  times,  on  Jews  own- 
ing land.  Although  83  percent  of  Jews  claimed  Russian  as  their 
native  language  in  the  1979  census,  the  Soviet  government  rec- 
ognized Yiddish  as  the  national  language  of  the  Jewish  popula- 
tion in  Russia  and  the  other  republics. 

In  the  early  1980s,  the  Kremlin's  refusal  to  allow  Jewish  emi- 
gration was  a  major  issue  of  contention  in  Soviet-American 
relations.  In  1974  the  United  States  Congress  had  passed  the 
Jackson- Vanik  Amendment,  which  offered  the  Soviet  Union 
most-favored-nation  trade  status  in  return  for  permission  for 
Soviet  Jews  to  emigrate.  The  Soviet  Union  responded  by  relax- 
ing its  restrictions,  and  in  the  years  that  followed  there  was  a 
steady  flow  of  Jewish  emigrants  from  the  Soviet  Union  to  Israel. 
But  the  intensification  of  the  Cold  War  in  the  years  after  the 
1979  invasion  of  Afghanistan  brought  new  restrictions  that 
were  not  lifted  fully  until  1989,  when  a  new  surge  of  emigration 
began.  Between  1992  and  1995,  the  emigration  of  Jews  from 
Russia  averaged  about  65,000  per  year,  after  reaching  a  peak  of 


218 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

188,000  in  1990.  In  1996  the  Russian  government  began  cur- 
tailing the  activity  of  the  Jewish  Agency,  an  internationally 
funded  organization  that  has  sponsored  Jewish  emigration 
since  the  1940s. 

The  Soviet  and  Russian  governments  have  always  regarded 
the  Jews  not  only  as  a  distinct  religious  group  but  also  as  a 
nationality.  This  attitude  persists  in  the  post-Soviet  era  despite  a 
provision  in  Article  26  of  the  1993  constitution  prohibiting  the 
state  from  arbitrarily  determining  a  person's  nationality  or  forc- 
ing a  person  to  declare  a  nationality. 

Although  official  anti-Semitism  has  ceased  and  open  acts  of 
anti-Semitism  have  been  rare  in  Russian  society  since  the  col- 
lapse of  the  Soviet  Union,  Jews  have  remained  mindful  of  their 
history  in  Russia  and  skeptical  of  the  durability  of  liberalized 
conditions.  Traditional  anti-Semitism  in  the  Russian  Orthodox 
Church  and  the  increasing  power  of  ultranationalist  and  neo- 
fascist  political  forces  are  the  principal  causes  of  concern;  Jews 
also  fear  that  they  might  become  scapegoats  for  economic  diffi- 
culties. Nevertheless,  in  the  early  1990s  Judaism  has  shown  a 
slow  but  sure  revival,  and  Russia's  Jews  have  experienced  a 
growing  interest  in  learning  about  their  religious  heritage.  In 
January  1996,  a  major  event  was  publication  in  Russia  of  a  Rus- 
sian translation  of  a  volume  of  the  Talmud.  The  first  such  pub- 
lication since  before  the  Bolshevik  Revolution,  the  volume 
marks  the  start  of  a  series  of  Talmudic  translations  intended  to 
provide  Russian  Jews  with  information  about  their  religion's 
teachings,  which  until  1996  had  been  virtually  unavailable  in 
Russia. 

With  Jews  becoming  more  willing  to  identify  themselves,  offi- 
cial estimates  of  the  Jewish  population  increased  between  1992 
and  1995,  from  500,000  to  around  700,000.  The  Jewish  popula- 
tion of  Moscow  has  been  estimated  in  the  mid-1990s  at  between 
200,000  and  300,000.  Of  that  number,  about  15  percent  are 
Sephardic  (non-European). 

The  number  of  Jews  participating  in  religious  observances 
remains  relatively  small,  even  though  organizations  such  as  the 
Hasidic  (Orthodox)  Chabad  Lubavitch  actively  encourage  full 
observance  of  religious  traditions.  In  Moscow  the  Lubavitchers, 
whose  activism  has  met  with  hostility  from  many  Russians,  run 
two  synagogues  and  several  schools,  including  a  yeshiva  (acad- 
emy of  Talmudic  learning),  kindergartens,  and  a  seminary  for 
young  women.  The  organization  also  is  active  in  charity  work.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  1990s,  a  number  of  organizations  devoted  to  the  fos- 
tering of  Jewish  culture  and  religion  have  been  established  in 
Moscow.  These  include  a  rabbinical  school,  a  Jewish  youth  cen- 
ter, a  union  of  Hebrew  teachers,  and  a  Jewish  cultural  and  edu- 
cational society.  The  orthodox  Jewish  community  also 
campaigned  successfully  for  the  return  of  the  Shneerson 
books,  a  collection  of  manuscripts  that  had  been  stored  in  the 
Lenin  State  Library  in  Moscow  since  Soviet  authorities  confis- 
cated them  in  the  1920s. 

Religion  and  Foreign  Policy 

In  the  1990s,  there  have  been  indications  that  religious  con- 
siderations can  influence  certain  areas  of  Russian  foreign  pol- 
icy, as  they  have  in  the  past.  Relations  with  the  newly 
independent  Muslim  states  of  Central  Asia  are  a  case  in  point. 
In  all  five  republics  of  that  region,  the  Russian  government  has 
strongly  supported  secular,  autocratic  Islamic  leaders  whose 
hold  on  power  is  justified  in  part  by  an  ostensible  threat  of 
Muslim  political  activism.  However,  only  in  Tajikistan  has  a  fac- 
tion with  any  sort  of  connection  to  Islamic  groups  attempted  to 
take  power.  There,  a  nominally  secular  Islamic  party  has  played 
a  central  role  in  a  prolonged  guerrilla  war  against  the  Russian- 
supported  regime,  with  assistance  from  Afghan  forces. 

Beginning  in  1992,  the  conflict  between  Muslims  and  Ortho- 
dox Serbs  in  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  has  tested  the  deeply 
ingrained  tradition  within  the  Orthodox  Church  of  protecting 
coreligionists  in  the  Middle  East,  the  Balkans,  and  elsewhere 
beyond  Russia's  borders  (see  Central  Europe,  ch.  8).  Russia's 
former  minister  of  foreign  affairs,  Andrey  Kozyrev,  cautioned 
against  making  the  Orthodox  religion  a  determinant  of  Rus- 
sian foreign  policy,  lest  such  a  policy  promote  a  split  in  Russia 
itself  between  Orthodox  and  Muslim  believers.  Nevertheless, 
nationalist  sentiment  in  Russia  caused  the  Yeltsin  government 
to  limit  its  participation  in  international  sanctions  and  military 
actions  against  Serbia. 

The  Russian  Language 

The  Russian  language  has  dominated  cultural  and  official 
life  throughout  the  history  of  the  nation,  regardless  of  the  pres- 
ence of  other  ethnic  groups.  Linguistic  groups  in  Russia  run 
the  gamut  from  Slavic  (spoken  by  more  than  three-quarters  of 
the  population)  to  Turkic,  Caucasian,  Finno-Ugric,  Eskimo, 


220 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

Yiddish,  and  Iranian.  Russification  campaigns  during  both  the 
tsarist  and  communist  eras  suppressed  the  languages  and  cul- 
tures of  all  minority  nationalities.  Although  the  Soviet-era  con- 
stitutions affirmed  the  equality  of  all  languages  with  Russian 
for  all  purposes,  in  fact  language  was  a  powerful  tool  of  Soviet 
nationality  policy.  The  governments  of  both  the  Soviet  Union 
and  the  Russian  Federation  have  used  the  Russian  language  as 
a  means  of  promoting  unity  among  the  country's  nationalities, 
as  well  as  to  provide  access  to  literary  and  scientific  materials 
not  available  in  minority  languages.  According  to  the  Brezhnev 
regime,  all  Soviet  peoples  "voluntarily"  adopted  Russian  for  use 
in  international  communication  and  to  promote  the  unity  of 
the  Soviet  Union. 

Beginning  in  1938,  the  Russian  language  was  a  compulsory 
subject  in  the  primary  and  secondary  schools  of  all  regions.  In 
schools  where  an  indigenous  language  was  used  alongside  Rus- 
sian, courses  in  science  and  mathematics  were  taught  in  Rus- 
sian. Many  university  courses  were  available  only  in  Russian, 
and  Russian  was  the  language  of  public  administration  in  all 
jurisdictions  in  all  fifteen  Soviet  republics.  Nevertheless,  the 
minority  peoples  of  the  Russian  Republic,  as  well  as  the  peoples 
of  the  other  fourteen  Soviet  republics,  continued  to  consider 
their  own  language  as  primary,  and  the  general  level  of  Russian 
fluency  was  low  (see  The  Post-Soviet  Education  Structure,  ch. 
5).  In  the  mid-1990s,  in  every  area  of  the  federation,  Russian 
remains  the  sole  language  of  public  administration,  of  the 
armed  forces,  and  of  the  scientific  and  technical  communities. 
Russian  schools  grant  diplomas  in  only  two  minority  languages, 
Bashkir  and  Tatar,  and  higher  education  is  conducted  almost 
entirely  in  Russian. 

Although  Russian  is  the  lingua  franca  of  the  Russian  Federa- 
tion, Article  26  of  the  1993  constitution  stipulates  that  "each 
person  has  the  right  to  use  his  native  language  and  to  the  free 
choice  of  language  of  communication,  education,  instruction, 
and  creativity."  Article  68  affirms  the  right  of  all  peoples  in  the 
Russian  Federation  "to  retain  their  mother  tongue  and  to  cre- 
ate conditions  for  its  study  and  development."  Although  such 
constitutional  provisions  often  prove  meaningless,  the  non- 
Slavic  tongues  of  Russia  have  retained  their  vitality,  and  they 
even  have  grown  more  prevalent  in  some  regions.  This  trend  is 
especially  visible  as  autonomy  of  language  becomes  an  impor- 
tant symbol  of  the  struggle  to  preserve  distinct  ethnic  identi- 
ties. In  the  1990s,  many  non-Russian  ethnic  groups  have  issued 


221 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

laws  or  decrees  giving  their  native  languages  equal  status  with 
Russian  in  their  respective  regions  of  the  Russian  Federation. 
In  the  mid-1990s,  some  80  percent  of  the  non-Slavic  nationali- 
ties— or  12  percent  of  the  population  of  the  Russian  Federa- 
tion— did  not  speak  Russian  as  their  first  language. 

Literature  and  the  Arts 

Russian  civilization  has  produced  classic  works  of  art  in  all 
genres,  including  innovations  of  lasting  significance  in  litera- 
ture, music,  and  ballet.  The  artistic  process  often  has  collided 
with  political  dogma,  and  outside  influences  have  combined 
with  "pure  Russian"  art  forms  in  a  sometimes  uneasy  harmony. 

Literature 

In  the  course  of  Russia's  thousand-year  history,  Russian  liter- 
ature has  come  to  occupy  a  unique  place  in  the  culture,  poli- 
tics, and  linguistic  evolution  of  the  Russian  people.  In  the 
modern  era,  literature  has  been  the  arena  for  heated  discus- 
sion of  virtually  all  aspects  of  Russian  life,  including  the  place 
that  literature  itself  should  occupy  in  that  life.  In  the  process,  it 
has  produced  a  rich  and  varied  fund  of  artistic  achievement. 

The  Beginnings 

Literature  first  appeared  among  the  East  Slavs  after  the 
Christianization  of  Kievan  Rus'  in  the  tenth  century  (see  The 
Golden  Age  of  Kiev,  ch.  1).  Seminal  events  in  that  process  were 
the  development  of  the  Cyrillic  (see  Glossary)  alphabet  around 
A.D.  863  and  the  development  of  Old  Church  Slavonic  as  a 
liturgical  language  for  use  by  the  Slavs.  The  availability  of  litur- 
gical works  in  the  vernacular  language — an  advantage  not 
enjoyed  in  Western  Europe — caused  Russian  literature  to 
develop  rapidly.  Through  the  sixteenth  century,  most  literary 
works  had  religious  themes  or  were  created  by  religious  figures. 
Among  the  noteworthy  works  of  the  eleventh  through  four- 
teenth centuries  are  the  Primary  Chronicle,  a  compilation  of  his- 
torical and  legendary  events,  the  Lay  of  Igor's  Campaign,  a 
secular  epic  poem  about  battles  against  the  Turkic  Pechenegs, 
and  Zadonsh china,  an  epic  poem  about  the  defeat  of  the  Mon- 
gols in  1380.  Works  in  secular  genres  such  as  the  satirical  tale 
began  to  appear  in  the  sixteenth  century,  and  Byzantine  liter- 
ary traditions  began  to  fade  as  the  Russian  vernacular  came 
into  greater  use  and  Western  influences  were  felt.

Written  in  1670,  the  Life  of  the  Archpriest  Avvakum  is  a  pio- 
neering realistic  autobiography  that  avoids  the  flowery  church 
style  in  favor  of  vernacular  Russian.  Several  novellas  and  satires 
of  the  seventeenth  century  also  used  vernacular  Russian  freely. 
The  first  Russian  poetic  verse  was  written  early  in  the  seven- 
teenth century. 

Peter  and  Catherine 

The  eighteenth  century,  particularly  the  reigns  of  Peter  the 
Great  and  Catherine  the  Great  (r.  1762-96),  was  a  period  of 
strong  Western  cultural  influence.  Russian  literature  was  domi- 
nated briefly  by  European  classicism  before  shifting  to  an 
equally  imitative  sentimentalism  by  1780.  Secular  prose  tales — 
many  picaresque  or  satirical — grew  in  popularity  with  the  mid- 
dle and  lower  classes,  as  the  nobility  read  mainly  literature 
from  Western  Europe.  Peter's  secularization  of  the  Russian 
Orthodox  Church  decisively  broke  the  influence  of  religious 
themes  on  literature.  The  middle  period  of  the  eighteenth  cen- 
tury (1725-62)  was  dominated  by  the  stylistic  and  genre  inno- 
vations of  four  writers:  Antiokh  Kantemir,  Vasiliy  Trediakovskiy, 
Mikhail  Lomonosov,  and  Aleksandr  Sumarokov.  Their  work 


223 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

was  a  further  step  in  bringing  Western  literary  concepts  to  Rus- 
sia. 

Under  Catherine,  the  satirical  journal  was  adopted  from 
Britain,  and  Gavriil  Derzhavin  advanced  the  evolution  of  Rus- 
sian poetry.  Denis  Fonvizin,  Yakov  Knyazhnin,  Aleksandr 
Radishchev,  and  Nikolay  Karamzin  wrote  controversial  and 
innovative  drama  and  prose  works  that  brought  Russian  litera- 
ture closer  to  its  nineteenth-century  role  as  an  art  form  liber- 
ally furnished  with  social  and  political  commentary  (see 
Imperial  Expansion  and  Maturation:  Catherine  II,  ch.  1).  The 
lush,  sentimental  language  of  Karamzin's  tale  Poor  Lisa  set  off  a 
forty-year  polemic  pitting  advocates  of  innovation  against  those 
of  "purity"  in  literary  language. 

The  Nineteenth  Century 

By  1800  Russian  literature  had  an  established  tradition  of 
representing  real-life  problems,  and  its  eighteenth-century 
practitioners  had  enriched  its  language  with  new  elements.  On 
this  basis,  a  brilliant  century  of  literary  endeavor  followed. 

Russian  literature  of  the  nineteenth  century  provided  a  con- 
genial medium  for  the  discussion  of  political  and  social  issues 
whose  direct  presentation  was  censored.  The  prose  writers  of 
this  period  shared  important  qualities:  attention  to  realistic, 
detailed  descriptions  of  everyday  Russian  life;  the  lifting  of  the 
taboo  on  describing  the  vulgar,  unsightly  side  of  life;  and  a 
satirical  attitude  toward  mediocrity  and  routine.  All  of  those 
elements  were  articulated  primarily  in  the  novel  and  short 
story  forms  borrowed  from  Western  Europe,  but  the  poets  of 
the  nineteenth  century  also  produced  works  of  lasting  value. 

The  Age  of  Realism,  generally  considered  the  culmination  of 
the  literary  synthesis  of  earlier  generations,  began  around 
1850.  The  writers  of  that  period  owed  a  great  debt  to  four  men 
of  the  previous  generation:  the  writers  Aleksandr  Pushkin, 
Mikhail  Lermontov,  and  Nikolay  Gogol1,  and  the  critic  Vissar- 
ion  Belinskiy,  each  of  whom  contributed  to  new  standards  for 
language,  subject  matter,  form,  and  narrative  techniques.  Push- 
kin is  recognized  as  the  greatest  Russian  poet,  and  the  critic 
Belinskiy  was  the  "patron  saint"  of  the  influential  "social  mes- 
sage" writers  and  critics  who  followed.  Lermontov  contributed 
innovations  in  both  poetic  and  prose  genres.  Gogol1  is 
accepted  as  the  originator  of  modern  realistic  Russian  prose, 
although  much  of  his  work  contains  strong  elements  of  fantasy. 
The  rich  language  of  Gogol1  was  much  different  from  the 


224 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

direct,  sparse  lexicon  of  Pushkin;  each  of  the  two  approaches 
to  the  language  of  literary  prose  was  adopted  by  significant 
writers  of  later  generations. 

By  mid-century  a  heated  debate  was  under  way  on  the  appro- 
priateness of  social  questions  in  literature.  The  debate  filled 
the  pages  of  the  "thick  journals"  of  the  time,  which  remained 
the  most  fertile  site  for  literary  discussion  and  innovation  into 
the  1990s;  traces  of  the  debate  appeared  in  the  pages  of  much 
of  Russia's  best  literature  as  well.  The  foremost  advocates  of 
social  commentary  were  Nikolay  Chernyshevskiy  and  Nikolay 
Dobrolyubov,  critics  who  wrote  for  the  thick  journal  Sovremen- 
nik  (The  Contemporary)  in  the  late  1850s  and  early  1860s. 

The  best  prose  writers  of  the  Age  of  Realism  were  Ivan  Tur- 
genev,  Fedor  Dostoyevskiy,  and  Lev  Tolstoy.  Because  of  the 
enduring  quality  of  their  combination  of  pure  literature  with 
eternal  philosophical  questions,  the  last  two  are  accepted  as 
Russia's  premier  prose  artists;  Dostoyevskiy's  novels  Crime  and 
Punishment  and  The  Brothers  Karamazov,  like  Tolstoy's  novels  War 
and  Peace  and  Anna  Karenina,  are  classics  of  world  literature. 

Other  outstanding  writers  of  the  Age  of  Realism  were  the 
playwright  Aleksandr  Ostrovskiy,  the  novelist  Ivan  Goncharov, 
and  the  prose  innovator  Nikolay  Leskov,  all  of  whom  were 
closely  involved  in  some  way  with  the  debate  over  social  com- 
mentary. The  most  notable  poets  of  mid-century  were  Afanasiy 
Fet  and  Fedor  Tyutchev. 

An  important  tool  for  writers  of  social  commentary  under 
strict  tsarist  censorship  was  a  device  called  Aesopic  language — a 
variety  of  linguistic  tricks,  allusions,  and  distortions  compre- 
hensible to  an  attuned  reader  but  baffling  to  censors.  The  best 
practitioner  of  this  style  was  Mikhail  Saltykov-Shchedrin,  a 
prose  satirist  who,  along  with  the  poet  Nikolay  Nekrasov,  was 
considered  a  leader  of  the  literary  left  wing  in  the  second  half 
of  the  century. 

The  major  literary  figure  in  the  last  decade  of  the  nine- 
teenth century  was  Anton  Chekhov,  who  wrote  in  two  genres: 
the  short  story  and  drama.  Chekhov  was  a  realist  who  exam- 
ined the  foibles  of  individuals  rather  than  society  as  a  whole. 
His  plays  The  Cherry  Orchard,  The  Seagull,  and  The  Three  Sisters 
continue  to  be  performed  worldwide. 

In  the  1890s,  Russian  poetry  was  revived  and  thoroughly 
reshaped  by  a  new  group,  the  symbolists,  whose  most  promi- 
nent representative  was  Aleksandr  Blok.  Two  more  groups,  the 
futurists  and  the  acmeists,  added  new  poetic  principles  at  the

start  of  the  twentieth  century.  The  leading  figure  of  the  former 
was  Vladimir  Mayakovskiy,  and  of  the  latter,  Anna  Akhmatova. 
The  premier  prose  writers  of  the  period  were  the  realist  writers 
Leonid  Andreyev,  Ivan  Bunin,  Maksim  Gor'kiy,  Vladimir  Koro- 
lenko,  and  Aleksandr  Kuprin.  Gor'kiy  became  the  literary  fig- 
urehead of  the  Bolsheviks  and  of  the  Soviet  regimes  of  the 
1920s  and  1930s;  shortly  after  the  Bolshevik  Revolution,  Bunin 
and  Kuprin  emigrated  to  Paris.  In  1933  Bunin  became  the  first 
Russian  to  receive  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Literature. 

The  Soviet  Period  and  After 

The  period  immediately  following  the  Bolshevik  Revolution 
was  one  of  literary  experimentation  and  the  emergence  of 
numerous  literary  groups.  Much  of  the  fiction  of  the  1920s 
described  the  Civil  War  or  the  struggle  between  the  old  and 
new  Russia.  The  best  prose  writers  of  the  1920s  were  Isaak 
Babel',  Mikhail  Bulgakov,  Veniamin  Kaverin,- Leonid  Leonov, 
Yuriy  Olesha,  Boris  Pil'nyak,  Yevgeniy  Zamyatin,  and  Mikhail 
Zoshchenko.  The  dominant  poets  were  Akhmatova,  Osip  Man- 
del'shtam,  Mayakovskiy,  Pasternak,  Marina  Tsvetayeva,  and 
Sergey  Yesenin.  But  under  Stalin,  literature  felt  the  same 
restrictions  as  the  rest  of  Russia's  society.  After  a  group  of  "pro- 
letarian writers"  had  gained  ascendancy  in  the  early  1930s,  the 
communist  party  Central  Committee  forced  all  fiction  writers 
into  the  Union  of  Soviet  Writers  in  1934.  The  union  then  estab- 
lished the  standard  of  "socialist  realism"  for  Soviet  literature, 
and  many  of  the  writers  in  Russia  fell  silent  or  emigrated  (see 
Mobilization  of  Society,  ch.  2).  A  few  prose  writers  adapted  by 
describing  moral  problems  in  the  new  Soviet  state,  but  the 
stage  was  dominated  by  formulaic  works  of  minimal  literary 
value  such  as  Nikolay  Ostrovskiy's  How  the  Steel  Was  Tempered  and 
Yuriy  Krymov's  Tanker  Derbent.  A  unique  work  of  the  1930s  was 
the  Civil  War  novel  The  Quiet  Don,  which  won  its  author,  Mikhail 
Sholokhov,  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Literature  in  1965,  although 
Sholokhov's  authorship  is  disputed  by  some  experts.  The  strict 
controls  of  the  1930s  continued  until  the  "thaw"  following  Sta- 
lin's death  in  1953,  although  some  innovation  was  allowed  in 
prose  works  of  the  World  War  II  period. 

Between  1953  and  1991,  Russian  literature  produced  a  num- 
ber of  first-rate  artists,  all  still  working  under  the  pressure  of 
state  censorship  and  often  distributing  their  work  through  a 
sophisticated  underground  system  called  samizdat  (literally, 
self-publishing).  The  poet  Pasternak's  Civil  War  novel,  Doctor 


226 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

Zhivago,  created  a  sensation  when  published  in  the  West  in 
1957.  The  book  won  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Literature  in  1958,  but 
the  Soviet  government  forced  Pasternak  to  decline  the  award. 
Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn,  whose  One  Day  in  the  Life  oflvanDeniso- 
vich  (1962)  also  was  a  watershed  work,  was  the  greatest  Russian 
philosophical  novelist  of  the  era;  he  was  exiled  from  the  Soviet 
Union  in  1974  and  eventually  settled  in  the  United  States.  In 
the  1960s  and  1970s,  a  new  generation  of  satirical  and  prose 
writers,  such  as  Fazil'  Iskander,  Vladimir  Voinovich,  Yuriy  Kaza- 
kov,  and  Vladimir  Aksyonov,  battled  against  state  restrictions  on 
artistic  expression,  as  did  the  noted  poets  Yevgeniy  Yevtush- 
enko,  Andrey  Voznesenskiy,  and  Joseph  Brodsky.  Aksyonov  and 
Brodsky  emigrated  to  the  United  States,  where  they  remained 
productive.  Brodsky  won  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Literature  in 
1987.  The  most  celebrated  case  of  literary  repression  in  the 
1960s  was  that  of  Andrey  Sinyavskiy  and  Yuliy  Daniel,  iconoclas- 
tic writers  of  the  Soviet  "underground"  whose  1966  sentence  to 
hard  labor  for  having  written  anti-Soviet  propaganda  brought 
international  protest. 

Another  generation  of  writers  responded  to  the  liberalized 
atmosphere  of  Gorbachev's  glasnost  in  the  second  half  of  the 
1980s,  openly  discussing  previously  taboo  themes:  the  excesses 
of  the  Stalin  era,  a  wide  range  of  previously  unrecognized 
social  ills  such  as  corruption,  random  violence,  anti-Semitism, 
and  prostitution,  and  even  the  unassailably  positive  image  of 
Vladimir  I.  Lenin  himself.  Among  the  best  of  this  generation 
were  Andrey  Bykov,  Mikhail  Kurayev,  Valeriy  Popov,  Tat'yana 
Tolstaya,  and  Viktor  Yerofeyev — writers  not  necessarily  as  tal- 
ented as  their  predecessors  but  expressing  a  new  kind  of  "alter- 
native fiction."  The  glasnost  period  also  saw  the  publication  of 
formerly  prohibited  works  by  writers  such  as  Bulgakov, 
Solzhenitsyn,  and  Zamyatin. 

Beginning  in  1992,  Russian  writers  experienced  complete 
creative  freedom  for  the  first  time  in  many  decades.  The 
change  was  not  entirely  for  the  better,  however.  The  urgent 
mission  of  the  Russian  writers,  to  provide  the  public  with  a  kind 
of  truth  they  could  not  find  elsewhere  in  a  censored  society, 
had  already  begun  to  disappear  in  the  1980s,  when  glasnost 
opened  Russia  to  a  deluge  of  information  and  entertainment 
flowing  from  the  West  and  elsewhere.  Samizdat  was  tacitly 
accepted  by  the  Gorbachev  regime,  then  it  disappeared 
entirely  as  private  publishers  appeared  in  the  early  1990s.  Writ- 
ers' traditional  special  place  in  society  no  longer  is  recognized 


227

by  most  Russians,  who  now  read  literature  much  less  avidly 
than  they  did  in  Soviet  times.  For  the  first  time  since  their 
appearance  in  the  early  1800s,  the  "thick  journals"  are  disre- 
garded by  large  portions  of  the  intelligentsia,  and  in  the  mid- 
1990s  several  major  journals  went  bankrupt.  Under  these  cir- 
cumstances, many  Russian  writers  have  expressed  a  sense  of 
deep  loss  and  frustration. 

Music 

Until  the  eighteenth  century,  Russian  music  consisted 
mainly  of  church  music  and  folk  songs  and  dances.  In  the 
1700s,  Italian,  French,  and  German  operas  were  introduced  to 
Russia,  making  opera  a  popular  art  form  among  the  aristoc- 
racy. 

In  the  nineteenth  century,  Russia  began  making  an  original 
contribution  to  world  music  nearly  as  significant  as  its  contribu- 
tion in  literature.  In  the  first  half  of  the  nineteenth  century, 
Mikhail  Glinka  (1804-57)  initiated  the  application  of  purely 
Russian  folk  and  religious  music  to  classical  compositions.  His 
best  operas,  Ruslan  and  Lyudmila  and  A  Life  for  the  Tsar,  are  con- 
sidered pioneering  works  in  the  establishment  of  Russian 
national  music,  although  they  are  based  on  Italian  models. 

In  1859  the  Russian  Music  Society  was  founded  to  foster  the 
performance  and  appreciation  of  classical  music,  especially 
German,  from  Western  Europe;  the  most  influential  figures  in 
the  society  were  the  composer  Anton  Rubinstein  and  his 
brother  Nikolay,  who  founded  influential  conservatories  in 
Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg.  Anton  Rubinstein  also  was  one  of 
the  best  pianists  of  the  nineteenth  century. 

In  the  second  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  a  group  of 
composers  that  came  to  be  known  as  the  "Mighty  Five" — Miliy 
Balakirev,  Aleksandr  Borodin,  Cesar  Cui,  Modest  Musorgskiy, 
and  Nikolay  Rimskiy-Korsakov — continued  Glinka's  movement 
away  from  imitation  of  European  classical  music.  The  Mighty 
Five  challenged  the  Russian  Music  Society's  conservatism  with  a 
large  body  of  work  thematically  based  on  Russia's  history  and 
legends  and  musically  based  on  its  folk  and  religious  music. 
Among  the  group's  most  notable  works  are  Rimskiy-Korsakov's 
symphonic  suite  Scheherezade  and  the  operas  The  Snow  Maiden 
and  Sadko,  Musorgskiy's  operas  Boris  Godunov  and  Khovan- 
shchina,  and  Borodin's  opera  Prince  Igor'.  Balakirev,  a  protege  of 
Glinka,  was  the  founder  and  guiding  spirit  of  the  group.

Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

Outside  that  group  stood  Peter  Ilich  Tchaikovsky  (Chay- 
kovskiy),  who  produced  a  number  of  enduring  symphonies, 
operas,  and  ballets  more  imitative  of  Western  music.  During  his 
lifetime,  Tchaikovsky  already  was  acknowledged  as  one  of  the 
world's  premier  composers.  Among  his  most-performed  works 
are  the  ballets  Swan  Lake,  Sleeping  Beauty,  and  The  Nutcracker, 
and  his  Sixth  Symphony,  known  as  the  Pathetique.  At  the  end 
of  the  1800s,  the  generation  that  followed  the  Mighty  Five  and 
Tchaikovsky  included  talented  and  innovative  figures  such  as 
Sergey  Rachmaninov,  a  master  pianist  and  composer  who  emi- 
grated to  Germany  in  1906;  Rimskiy-Korsakov's  student  Alek- 
sandr  Glazunov,  who  emigrated  in  1928;  and  the  innovator 
Aleksandr  Skryabin,  who  injected  elements  of  mysticism  and 
literary  symbolism  in  his  works  for  piano  and  orchestra. 

In  the  twentieth  century,  Russia  continued  to  produce  some 
of  the  world's  foremost  composers  and  musicians,  despite  the 
suppression  by  Soviet  authorities  of  both  music  and  perfor- 
mances. Restrictions  on  what  musicians  played  and  where  they 
performed  caused  many  artists  to  leave  the  Soviet  Union  either 
voluntarily  or  through  forced  exile,  but  the  works  of  the  emi- 
gres continued  to  draw  large  audiences  whenever  they  were 
performed.  The  Gorbachev  era  loosened  the  restrictions  on 
emigres  returning.  The  pianist  Vladimir  Horowitz,  who  left  the 
Soviet  Union  in  1925,  made  a  triumphal  return  performance 
in  Moscow  in  1986,  and  emigre  cellist  Mstislav  Rostropovich 
made  his  first  tour  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1990  as  conductor  of 
the  National  Symphony  Orchestra  in  Washington,  D.C. 

Igor'  Stravinskiy,  who  has  been  called  the  greatest  of  the 
twentieth-century  Russian  composers,  emigrated  permanently 
in  1920  after  having  composed  his  three  best-known  works,  the 
scores  for  the  ballets  The  Firebird,  Petrushka,  and  The  Rite  of 
Spring.  Stravinskiy  enjoyed  a  productive  career  of  several 
decades  in  exile,  making  return  visits  to  Russia  in  his  last  years. 
The  composers  Aram  Khachaturyan,  Sergey  Prokof  yev,  and 
Dmitriy  Shostakovich  spent  their  entire  careers  in  the  Soviet 
Union;  all  three  were  condemned  in  1948  in  the  postwar  Stalin- 
ist crackdown  known  as  the  Zhdanovshchina  (see  Reconstruc- 
tion and  Cold  War,  ch.  2).  Prokof  yev,  best  known  for  his  ballet 
music,  had  achieved  enough  international  stature  by  1948  to 
avoid  official  disgrace.  Shostakovich,  who  enjoyed  triumph  and 
suffered  censure  during  the  Stalin  era,  wrote  eleven  sympho- 
nies and  two  well-known  operas  based  on  nineteenth-century 
Russian  stories,  The  Nose  by  Gogol'  and  Lady  Macbeth  ofMtsensk

District  by  Leskov.  He  enjoyed  substantial  recognition  after  the 
"thaw"  that  liberated  artistic  activities  after  1953.  Khachaturyan 
based  much  of  his  work  on  Armenian  and  Georgian  folk  music. 

Composers  of  modern  music  received  much  criticism  in  the 
Soviet  period  for  digressing  from  realistic  or  traditional  styles. 
Both  official  Soviet  artistic  standards  and  the  traditional  expec- 
tations of  the  Russian  public  restricted  the  creation  and  perfor- 
mance of  innovative  pieces.  The  most  notable  avant-garde 
symphonic  composer  was  Alfred  Schnittke,  who  remained  in 
the  Soviet  Union,  where  his  work  won  approval.  Aleksey 
Volkonskiy  was  a  notable  member  of  Schnittke's  generation 
who  left  the  Soviet  Union  to  compose  in  the  West.  The 
restraints  of  the  1970s  and  1980s  stimulated  a  musical  under- 
ground, called  magnitizdat,  which  recorded  and  distributed  for- 
bidden folk,  rock,  and  jazz  works  in  small  batches.  Two  notable 
figures  in  that  movement  were  Bulat  Okudzhava  and  Vladimir 
Vysotskiy,  who  set  their  poetry  to  music  and  became  popular 
entertainers  with  a  satirical  message.  Vysotskiy,  who  died  in 
1980,  was  rehabilitated  in  1990;  Okudzhava  continued  his 
career  into  the  mid-1990s. 

Jazz  performances  were  permitted  by  all  Soviet  regimes,  and 
jazz  became  one  of  Russia's  most  popular  music  forms.  In  the 
1980s,  the  Ganelin  Trio  was  the  best-known  Russian  jazz 
combo,  performing  in  Europe  and  the  United  States.  Jazz 
musicians  from  the  West  began  playing  regularly  in  the  Soviet 
Union  in  the  1980s. 

Rock  music  was  controlled  strictly  by  Soviet  authorities,  with 
only  limited  recording  outside  magnitizdat,  although  Russia's 
youth  were  fascinated  with  the  rock  groups  of  the  West.  In  the 
more  liberal  atmosphere  of  the  late  1980s,  several  notable 
Soviet  rock  groups  emerged  with  official  approval  as  more 
innovative,  unsanctioned  groups  proliferated.  The  Leningrad 
Rock  Club,  which  became  a  national  network  of  performance 
clubs  in  1986,  was  the  most  important  outlet  for  sanctioned 
rock  music.  In  the  1990s,  much  of  Russia's  rock  music  lost  the 
innovative  and  satirical  edge  of  the  magnitizdat  period,  and 
experts  noted  a  tendency  to  simply  imitate  Western  groups. 

Ballet 

Russia  has  made  a  unique  contribution  to  the  development 
of  ballet.  Ballet  was  introduced  in  Russia  together  with  other 
aristocratic  dance  forms  as  part  of  Peter  the  Great's  Westerniza- 
tion program  in  the  early  1700s.  The  first  ballet  school  was 


230 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

established  in  1734,  and  the  first  full  ballet  company  was 
founded  at  the  Imperial  School  of  Ballet  in  St.  Petersburg  in 
the  1740s.  Italian  and  French  dancers  and  choreographers  pre- 
dominated in  that  period,  but  by  1800  Russian  ballet  was  assim- 
ilating native  elements  from  folk  dancing  as  nobles  sponsored 
dance  companies  of  serfs.  European  ballet  critics  agreed  that 
the  Russian  dance  had  a  positive  influence  on  West  European 
ballet.  Marius  Petipa,  a  French  choreographer  who  spent  fifty 
years  staging  ballets  in  Russia,  was  the  dominant  figure  during 
that  period;  his  greatest  triumphs  were  the  staging  of  Tchai- 
kovsky's ballets.  Other  noted  European  dancers,  such  as  Marie 
Taglioni,  Christian  Johansson,  and  Enrico  Cecchetti,  per- 
formed in  Russia  throughout  the  nineteenth  and  early  twenti- 
eth centuries,  bringing  new  influences  from  the  West. 

The  most  influential  figure  of  the  early  twentieth  century 
was  the  impresario  Sergey  Diaghilev,  who  founded  an  innova- 
tive touring  ballet  company  in  1909  with  choreographer 
Michel  Fokine,  dancer  Vaslav  Nijinksy,  and  designer  Alexandre 
Benois.  After  the  staging  of  Stravinskiy's  controversial  The  Rite 
of  Spring,  World  War  I  and  the  Bolshevik  Revolution  kept 
Diaghilev  from  returning  to  Russia.  Until  Diaghilev  died  in 
1929,  his  Russian  dance  company,  the  Ballet  Russe,  was  head- 
quartered in  Paris.  In  the  same  period,  the  emigre  dancer 
Anna  Pavlova  toured  the  world  with  her  troupe  and  exerted  a 
huge  influence  on  the  art  form. 

After  Diaghilev,  several  new  companies  calling  themselves 
the  Ballet  Russe  toured  the  world,  and  new  generations  of  Rus- 
sian dancers  filled  their  ranks.  George  Balanchine,  a  Georgian 
emigre  and  protege  of  Diaghilev,  formed  the  New  York  City 
Ballet  in  1948.  Meanwhile,  the  Soviet  government  sponsored 
new  ballet  companies  throughout  the  union.  After  a  period  of 
innovation  and  experimentation  in  the  1920s,  Russia's  ballet 
reverted  under  Stalin  to  the  traditional  forms  of  Petipa,  even 
changing  the  plots  of  some  ballets  to  emphasize  the  positive 
themes  of  socialist  realism.  The  most  influential  Russian 
dancer  of  the  mid-twentieth  century  was  Rudolf  Nureyev,  who 
defected  to  the  West  in  1961  and  is  credited  with  establishing 
the  dominant  role  of  the  male  dancer  in  classical  ballet.  A  sec- 
ond notable  emigre,  Mikhail  Baryshnikov,  burnished  an 
already  brilliant  career  in  the  United  States  after  defecting 
from  Leningrad's  Kirov  Ballet  in  1974.  The  large  cities  of  Rus- 
sia traditionally  have  their  own  symphony  orchestras  and  ballet 
and  opera  houses.  Although  funding  for  such  facilities  has 


231 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

diminished  in  the  1990s,  attendance  at  performances  remains 
high.  The  ballet  companies  of  the  Bol'shoy  Theater  in  Moscow 
and  the  Kirov  Theater  in  St.  Petersburg  are  world  renowned 
and  have  toured  regularly  since  the  early  1960s. 

Architecture  and  Painting 

Early  Slavic  tribes  created  handsome  jewelry,  wall  hangings, 
and  decorated  leather  items  that  have  been  recovered  from 
burial  mounds.  The  folk-art  motifs  made  liberal  use  of  animal 
forms  and  representations  of  natural  forces.  Subsequently,  the 
strongest  single  influence  on  Russian  art  was  the  acceptance  of 
Christianity  in  A.D.  988.  Transmitting  the  idea  that  the  beauty 
of  the  church's  physical  attributes  reflects  the  glory  of  God, 
Byzantine  religious  art  and  architecture  penetrated  Kiev,  which 
was  the  capital  of  the  early  Russian  state  until  about  1100  (see 
The  Golden  Age  of  Kiev,  ch.  1).  The  northern  cities  of 
Novgorod  and  Vladimir  developed  distinctive  architectural 
styles,  and  the  tradition  of  painting  icons,  religious  images  usu- 
ally painted  on  wooden  panels,  spread  as  more  churches  were 
built.  The  Mongol  occupation  (1240-1480)  cut  Muscovy's  ties 
with  the  Byzantine  Empire,  fostering  the  development  of  origi- 
nal artistic  styles.  Among  the  innovations  of  this  period  was  the 
iconostasis,  a  carved  choir  screen  on  which  icons  are  hung.  In 
the  early  fifteenth  century,  the  master  icon  painter  Andrey 
Rublev  created  some  of  Russia's  most  treasured  religious  art. 

As  the  Mongols  were  driven  out  and  Moscow  became  the 
center  of  Russian  civilization  in  the  late  fifteenth  century,  a  new 
wave  of  building  began  in  Russia's  cities.  Italian  architects 
brought  a  West  European  influence,  especially  in  the  recon- 
struction of  Moscow's  Kremlin,  the  city's  twelfth-century 
wooden  fortress.  St.  Basil's  Cathedral  in  Red  Square,  however, 
combined  earlier  church  architecture  with  styles  from  the 
Tatar  east.  In  the  1500s  and  1600s,  the  tsars  supported  icon 
painting,  metalwork,  and  manuscript  illumination;  as  contact 
with  Western  Europe  increased,  those  forms  began  to  reflect 
techniques  of  the  West.  Meanwhile,  folk  art  preserved  the 
forms  of  the  earlier  Slavic  tribes  in  house  decorations,  clothing, 
and  tools. 

Under  Peter  the  Great,  Russia  experienced  a  much  stronger 
dose  of  Western  influence.  Many  of  the  buildings  in  Peter's 
new  capital,  St.  Petersburg,  were  designed  by  the  Italian  archi- 
tects Domenico  Trezzini  and  Bartolomeo  Rastrelli  under  the 
direction  of  Peter  and  his  daughter,  Elizabeth.  The  most  pro- 


232 


Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 

ductive  Russian  architects  of  the  eighteenth  century,  Vasiliy 
Bazhenov,  Matvey  Kazakov,  and  Ivan  Starov,  created  lasting 
monuments  in  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  and  established  a 
base  for  the  more  Russian  forms  that  followed. 

The  Academy  of  Fine  Arts,  founded  by  Elizabeth  in  1757  to 
train  Russia's  artists,  brought  Western  techniques  of  secular 
painting  to  Russia,  which  until  that  time  had  been  dominated 
by  icon  painting.  Catherine  the  Great  (r.  1762-96),  another 
energetic  patron  of  the  arts,  began  collecting  European  art 
objects  that  formed  the  basis  of  the  collections  for  which  Russia 
now  is  famous.  Aleksey  Venetsianov,  the  first  graduate  of  the 
academy  to  fully  embrace  realistic  subject  matter  such  as  peas- 
ant life,  is  acknowledged  as  the  founder  of  Russia's  realistic 
school  of  painting,  which  blossomed  in  the  second  half  of  the 
1800s. 

In  the  1860s,  a  group  of  critical  realists,  led  by  Ivan  Kram- 
skoy,  Il'ya  Repin,  and  Vasiliy  Perov,  portrayed  aspects  of  Russian 
life  with  the  aim  of  making  social  commentary.  Repin's  Barge 
Haulers  on  the  Volga  is  one  of  the  most  famous  products  of  this 
school.  In  the  late  1800s,  a  new  generation  of  painters  empha- 
sized technique  over  subject,  producing  a  more  impressionistic 
body  of  work.  The  leaders  of  that  school  were  Valentin  Serov, 
Isaak  Levitan,  and  Mikhail  Vrubel'.  In  1898  the  theatrical 
designer  Alexandre  Benois  and  the  dance  impresario  Sergey 
Diaghilev  founded  the  World  of  Art  group,  which  extended  the 
innovation  of  the  previous  generation,  played  a  central  role  in 
introducing  the  contemporary  modern  art  of  Western  Europe 
to  Russia,  and  acquainted  West  Europeans  with  Russia's  art 
through  exhibitions  and  publications. 

In  the  nineteenth  century,  Russia's  architecture  and  decora- 
tive arts  combined  European  techniques  and  influences  with 
the  forms  of  early  Russia,  producing  the  so-called  Russian 
Revival  seen  in  churches,  public  buildings,  and  homes  of  that 
period.  The  European-trained  goldsmith,  jeweler,  and  designer 
Karl  Faberge,  the  most  notable  member  of  a  brilliant  artistic 
family,  established  workshops  in  Moscow,  St.  Petersburg,  and 
London.  His  work,  including  jeweled  enamel  Easter  eggs  pro- 
duced for  the  Russian  royal  family,  is  an  important  example  of 
the  decorative  art  of  the  period. 

The  Russian  artists  of  the  early  twentieth  century  were 
exposed  to  a  wide  variety  of  Russian  and  European  movements. 
Among  the  most  innovative  and  influential  of  that  generation 
were  the  painters  Marc  Chagall,  Natal'ya  Goncharova,  Vasiliy

Kandinskiy,  Mikhail  Larionov,  and  Kazimir  Malevich.  The  con- 
structivists  of  the  1920s  found  parallels  between  their  architec- 
tural and  sculptural  work  and  the  precepts  of  the  Bolshevik 
Revolution.  By  the  1930s,  the  government  was  limiting  all 
forms  of  artistic  expression  to  the  themes  of  socialist  realism, 
forbidding  abstract  forms  and  the  exhibition  of  foreign  art  for 
more  than  thirty  years.  An  "unofficial"  art  movement  appeared 
in  the  1960s  under  the  leadership  of  sculptor  Ernest  Neizvest- 
nyy  and  painters  Mikhail  Chemyakhin,  Oskar  Rabin,  and  Yev- 
geniy  Rukhin.  In  the  1970s  and  the  early  1980s,  informal  art 
exhibits  were  held  in  parks  and  social  clubs.  Like  the  other  arts, 
painting  and  sculpture  benefited  from  the  policy  of  glasnost  of 
the  late  1980s,  which  encouraged  artistic  innovation  and  the 
exhibition  of  works  abroad. 

Outlook 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  Russian  Federation  remains  an  amal- 
gam of  widely  varying  ethnic  groups  and  cultures.  In  fact,  the 
differentiation  among  groups  has  increased  since  the  demise 
of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  much  less  repressive  grasp  of  Russia's 
central  government  has  encouraged  both  cultural  and  political 
autonomy,  although  ethnic  Russians  constitute  about  80  per- 
cent of  the  population  and  about  75  percent  of  religious  believ- 
ers are  Russian  Orthodox.  Many  minority  groups  maintain 
their  ethnic  traditions,  continue  wide  use  of  their  languages, 
and  demand  economic  and  political  autonomy  partially  based 
on  ethnic  differences. 

In  the  1990s,  Islam,  which  has  the  second  largest  body  of 
religious  believers  in  Russia,  has  prospered  among  many  of  the 
ethnic  groups.  The  Russian  Orthodox  Church  also  has  experi- 
enced a  renaissance  after  emerging  from  Soviet  repression;  the 
church's  membership,  secular  influence,  and  infrastructure 
expanded  rapidly  in  the  1990s. 

Russia's  long  and  rich  literary  history  came  to  a  new  cross- 
roads beginning  in  the  late  1980s,  as  freedom  of  expression 
seemingly  ended  the  traditional  role  of  literature  as  the  anti- 
dote to  authoritarian  dogma.  Like  literature,  other  elements  of 
the  federation's  cultural  and  artistic  life,  all  of  them  with  nota- 
ble past  accomplishments,  remained  in  a  transitional  stage  in 
the  1990s.

Ethnic,  Religious,  and  Cultural  Setting 


The  Handbook  of  Major  Soviet  Nationalities,  edited  by  Zev  Katz, 
is  a  somewhat  dated  but  detailed  listing  of  ethnic  groups. 
National  Identity  and  Ethnicity  in  Russia  and  the  New  States  of  Eur- 
asia, edited  by  Roman  Szporluk,  provides  a  discussion  of  the 
unique  viewpoints  of  all  the  major  ethnic  groups  of  the  former 
Soviet  Union,  including  those  remaining  in  the  Russian  Feder- 
ation. In  Islamic  Peoples  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Shirin  Akiner  lists  and 
describes  all  the  Islamic  ethnic  groups  in  that  category;  that 
book  is  supplemented  by  Muslims  of  the  Soviet  Empire:  A  Guide  by 
Alexandre  Bennigsen,  Marie  Broxup,  and  S.  Enders  Wimbush. 
Religion  as  an  ongoing  element  of  Russian  culture  is  described 
in  Russian  Culture  in  Modern  Times,  edited  by  Robert  R  Hughes

Chapter  5.  The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  girl  with  the  golden  hair  sits  on  a  stone  at  the  water's  edge  (design  from 
lacquer  box  made  in  village  of  Kholuy). 


THE  DEMISE  OF  THE  SOVIET  UNION  in  1991  brought  a 
measure  of  freedom  to  Russia's  people,  but  at  the  same  time 
this  change  removed  or  severely  weakened  certain  elements  of 
the  social  safety  net,  which  for  many  years  had  included  a  guar- 
antee of  employment,  basic  medical  care,  and  government  sub- 
sidies for  food,  clothing,  shelter,  and  transportation.  For  the 
average  citizen,  social  and  economic  conditions  worsened  con- 
siderably in  the  early  postcommunist  era.  Although  some  com- 
ponents of  state  support  remained  close  to  their  Soviet-era 
levels,  the  government  lacked  the  resources  to  compensate 
Russia's  citizens  for  the  stresses  of  the  transition  period. 

The  end  of  the  Soviet  Union  meant  the  disappearance  of  a 
reliable,  if  mediocre,  set  of  social  expectations.for  every  Rus- 
sian. Lacking  such  guidance,  various  elements  of  Russian  soci- 
ety moved  in  very  different  directions.  A  small  segment  took 
immediate  action — both  legal  and  illegal — to  make  the  most  of 
its  newfound  range  of  opportunities  for  self-expression  and 
economic  advancement.  Although  few  such  adventurers  found 
success,  those  who  did  coalesced  into  a  new  class  of  wealthy 
Russians  independent  of  the  government.  The  vast  majority, 
however,  met  the  prospect  of  reduced  predictability  in  their 
lives  with  suspicion,  confusion,  or  resentment.  Remembering 
the  security  of  Soviet  life,  many  clung  to  symbolic  or  real  rem- 
nants of  that  life,  particularly  in  the  workplace. 

As  the  economic  controls  of  centralized  government  were 
eased,  prices  for  basic  necessities  rose — sometimes  precipi- 
tously— and  society  was  buffeted  by  marked  increases  in  crime, 
infectious  diseases,  drug  addiction,  homelessness,  and  suicide. 
Growing  pollution  and  other  environmental  hazards  added  to 
the  malaise. 

Social  Structure 

In  the  mid-1990s,  Russian  society  was  in  the  midst  of  a 
wrenching  transition  from  a  totalitarian  structure  to  a  protode- 
mocracy  of  unknown  character.  During  most  of  the  Soviet  era, 
society  was  atomized,  so  that  the  communist  regime  and  its 
"transmission  belts"  (officially  sanctioned  organizations  and 
institutions  of  every  kind,  from  trade  unions  to  youth  groups) 
could  fully  monitor  and  control  each  individual.  Civil  society 


239 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

was  nonexistent.  The  lines  of  control  ran  from  the  top  down, 
through  a  rigid  hierarchy  constructed  and  staffed  by  the  ruling 
Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (GPSU — see  Glossary). 

Post-Soviet  Russia  is  slowly  striving  to  create  a  civil  society 
and  restore  the  family  and  other  basic  institutions  as  functional 
units  within  the  society.  In  the  mid-1990s,  habits  of  trust,  per- 
sonal responsibility,  community  service,  and  citizen  coopera- 
tion remained  unformed  in  much  of  Russia's  society,  as  the 
social  attitudes  of  previous  decades  remained  intact.  Those 
holding  such  attitudes  envisioned  little  between  the  extremes 
of  totalitarianism  and  social  anarchy;  having  moved  away  from 
the  simplistic  guidance  of  the  former,  much  of  society  was 
strongly  tempted  to  embrace  the  latter. 

Social  Stratification 

Perhaps  the  most  significant  fact  about  Russia's  social  struc- 
ture is  that  ideology  no  longer  determines  social  status.  During 
the  Soviet  era,  membership  in  the  CPSU  was  the  surest  path  to 
career  advancement  and  wealth.  Political  decisions  rather  than 
market  forces  determined  social  status.  Despite  Marxist-Lenin- 
ist (see  Glossary)  notions  of  a  classless  society,  the  Soviet  Union 
had  a  powerful  ruling  class,  the  nomenklatura,  which  consisted 
of  party  officials  and  key  personnel  in  the  government  and 
other  important  sectors  such  as  heavy  industry.  This  class 
enjoyed  privileges  such  as  roomy  apartments,  country  dachas, 
and  access  to  special  stores,  schools,  medical  facilities,  and  rec- 
reational sites.  The  social  status  and  income  of  members  of  the 
nomenklatura  increased  as  they  were  promoted  to  higher  posi- 
tions in  the  party. 

The  social  structure  of  the  Soviet  Union  was  characterized 
by  self-perpetuation  and  limited  mobility.  Access  to  higher  edu- 
cation, a  prerequisite  to  political  and  social  advancement,  was 
steadily  constrained  in  the  postwar  decades.  The  so-called 
period  of  stagnation  that  coincided  with  the  long  tenure  of 
CPSU  chief  Leonid  I.  Brezhnev  (in  office  1964-82)  had  social 
as  well  as  political  connotations.  Moreover,  the  sluggish  econ- 
omy of  that  period  reduced  opportunities  for  social  mobility, 
thus  accentuating  differences  among  social  groups  and  further 
widening  the  gap  between  the  nomenklatura  and  the  rest  of  soci- 
ety. 

Members  of  the  urban  working  class  (proletariat),  in  whose 
name  the  party  purported  to  rule,  generally  lived  in  cramped 
apartment  complexes,  spent  hours  each  day  standing  in  line  to 


240 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


buy  food  and  other  necessities,  and  attended  frequent  obliga- 
tory sessions  of  political  indoctrination.  Similarly,  the  peas- 
antry eked  out  a  meager  existence,  with  little  opportunity  for 
relief.  Agricultural  workers  constituted  the  bottom  layer  of 
Soviet  society,  receiving  the  least  pay,  the  least  opportunity  for 
social  advancement,  and  the  least  representation  in  the  nomi- 
nally all-inclusive  CPSU  leadership. 

Postcommunist  society  also  is  characterized  by  a  wide  dispar- 
ity in  wealth  and  privilege.  Although  there  is  no  rigid  class 
structure,  social  stratification  based  on  wealth  is  evident  and 
growing.  The  nomenklatura  as  it  existed  in  Soviet  times  disap- 
peared with  the  demise  of  the  CPSU,  but  many  of  its  members 
used  their  continuing  connections  with  industry  and  finance  to 
enrich  themselves  in  the  emerging  capitalist  system.  According 
to  a  1995  study  conducted  by  the  Russian  Academy  of  Sciences, 
more  than  60  percent  of  Russia's  wealthiest  millionaires,  and 
75  percent  of  the  new  political  elite,  are  former  members  of 
the  communist  nomenklatura,  and  38  percent  of  Russia's  busi- 
nesspeople  held  economic  positions  in  the  CPSU.  The  wealth 
of  the  new  capitalists,  who  constitute  1  to  2  percent  of  the  pop- 
ulation, derives  from  the  ownership  of  private  property,  which 
was  prohibited  under  the  communist  regime;  from  former 
black-market  transactions  that  now  are  pursued  legally;  and 
from  repatriation  of  funds  that  were  secretly  transferred 
abroad  during  the  Soviet  era.  Entrepreneurs  have  purchased 
former  state-owned  enterprises  privatized  by  the  government 
(often  using  connections  with  government  authorities  to  gain 
favorable  treatment)  and  have  opened  banks,  stock  exchanges, 
and  other  ventures  typical  of  a  market  economy  (see  Banking 
and  Finance;  Privatization,  ch.  6).  By  the  mid-1990s,  Russia  had 
by  no  means  established  a  full-fledged  market  economy,  but 
the  era  of  capitalism,  which  the  Bolshevik  Revolution  had  cut 
short,  was  ascendant. 

The  most  successful  of  the  new  capitalists  practice  conspicu- 
ous consumption  on  an  extravagant  scale,  driving  flashy  West- 
ern cars,  sporting  expensive  clothing  and  jewelry,  and 
frequenting  stylish  restaurants  and  clubs  that  are  far  beyond 
the  reach  of  ordinary  Russians.  Russian  biznesmeny  with  cash- 
filled  briefcases  purchase  expensive  real  estate  in  exclusive 
areas  of  Western  Europe  and  the  United  States.  Other  areas  of 
the  world,  such  as  the  city  of  Limassol,  Cyprus,  have  been  trans- 
formed into  virtual  Russian  enclaves  where  illicit  commercial 
transactions  help  fuel  the  economy.  Russian  capitalists  attempt-

ing  to  achieve  at  a  high  level  using  legitimate  means  must 
nonetheless  pay  protection  money  to  criminal  groups,  espe- 
cially in  the  larger  cities. 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the  gap  between  the  richest  and 
poorest  citizens  of  Russia  grew  steadily,  and  it  became  a  source 
of  social  alienation  because  newly  successful  Russians  are 
resented  and  often  are  assumed  to  have  criminal  connections. 
In  1995  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  ranked  Russia's  dichot- 
omy between  the  highest  and  lowest  economic  echelons  on  a 
par  with  the  wide  gaps  between  rich  and  poor  in  Argentina  and 
Turkey.  However,  by  1996  the  gap  had  decreased  slightly. 
According  to  the  State  Committee  for  Statistics  (Goskomstat), 
in  1995  the  wealthiest  10  percent  of  Russians  earned  13.5  times 
as  much  as  the  poorest  10  percent.  In  1996  the  ratio  had 
shrunk  to  12.8  percent,  suggesting  that  more  people  were  shar- 
ing in  the  wealth.  According  to  reports  in  1996,  the  flaunting 
of  luxurious  automobiles,  clothing,  and  other  forms  of  mate- 
rial wealth  became  less  prevalent  in  Russia's  largest  cities,  espe- 
cially Moscow,  which  is  the  center  of  the  nouveau  riche 
population. 

Nonreporting  of  incomes  by  the  highest  socioeconomic  level 
likely  makes  the  real  gap  wider  than  the  official  statistics  indi- 
cate. The  overall  decline  in  living  standards  in  1995  is  revealed 
by  an  8  percent  decrease  in  retail  trade  and  by  opinion  surveys. 
For  instance,  in  early  1995  some  56  percent  of  respondents  said 
that  their  material  situation  had  declined,  and  17  percent  said 
that  it  had  improved.  Another  survey  identified  68  percent  of 
respondents  claiming  to  live  below  the  poverty  line  in  1995, 
compared  with  56  percent  the  previous  year.  Such  self-percep- 
tions of  victimization  promote  the  platforms  of  antireform 
political  parties  that  promise  a  return  to  the  guaranteed  well- 
being  of  the  Soviet  era  (see  The  Elections  of  1995,  ch.  7). 

A  subclass  of  young  businesspeople,  mainly  bankers  and 
stockbrokers,  runs  the  new  trading  and  investment  markets  in 
Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg,  remaining  aloof  from  the  tangled, 
state-dominated  manufacturing  sector.  This  group,  a  very  visi- 
ble part  of  life  in  the  larger  cities  in  the  mid-1990s,  has  profited 
from  the  youthful  flexibility  that  enabled  it  to  embrace  an 
entirely  new  set  of  rules  for  economic  success,  while  Russia's 
older  generations — with  the  exception  of  the  astute  nomenkla- 
tura members  who  became  part  of  the  nouveau  riche — were 
much  less  able  to  adapt  to  the  post-Soviet  world.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Conditions  for  the  working  class  and  the  peasants  are 
sharply  at  variance  with  those  of  the  new  capitalist  class.  Politi- 
cal repression  has  eased,  but  economic  privations  have 
increased.  Although  more  goods  are  available,  they  are  often 
beyond  the  means  of  the  average  worker.  Full  employment,  the 
virtually  guaranteed  basis  of  survival  under  communism,  no 
longer  is  the  norm  (see  Unemployment,  ch.  6).  At  the  lower 
end  of  the  social  scale,  the  "working  poor"  toil  predominantly 
in  agriculture,  education,  culture,  science,  and  health,  most  of 
which  are  considered  middle-class  fields  of  employment  in  the 
West.  State  employees,  who  suffer  especially  from  inflation 
because  of  infrequent  wage  adjustments,  often  fall  below  the 
official  poverty  line. 

Young  parents  with  little  work  experience  and  more  than 
one  child  are  especially  likely  to  be  members  of  the  working 
poor.  In  1993  some  57  percent  of  families  classified  as  poor  by 
the  World  Bank  had  one  or  more  children,  and  86  percent  of 
families  with  three  or  more  children  were  classified  in  the  low- 
est income  group.  Most  single-parent  families  also  belonged  to 
this  group.  In  the  lower-  income  groups,  people  with  relatives 
generally  fare  better  than  those  with  none  (especially  single 
pensioners),  as  the  informal  subsistence  networks  formed  dur- 
ing the  Soviet  era  continue  to  provide  support  to  a  substantial 
segment  of  society. 

The  glasnost  (see  Glossary)  policy  of  the  late  1980s  brought  a 
new  youth  culture  that  took  up  the  nonconformist  dress,  drug 
use,  music,  and  antiestablishment  stance  of  young  people  in 
the  West,  while  earnestly  seeking  answers  to  questions  about 
Russia's  past  and  its  potential  future.  The  social  and  economic 
stresses  and  disappointments  of  the  1990s  have  pushed  the 
majority  of  young  Russians  completely  out  of  the  youth  culture, 
while  the  few  who  have  won  some  sort  of  success  have  moved  to 
further  extremes,  such  as  hedonism  and  wild  economic  specu- 
lation. In  the  cities,  clubs  and  bars,  all  making  heavy  protection 
payments  to  the  mafiya — as  Russia's  growing  organized  crime 
groups  are  termed — are  gathering  places  that  feature  a  variety 
of  narcotics  (including  mushrooms  gathered  in  the  woods  near 
St.  Petersburg),  alcohol,  and  a  form  of  Russian  rock  music  that 
was  full  of  protest  in  the  late  1980s  but  has  since  been  diluted 
to  widen  its  market  appeal.  This  small  but  highly  visible  class  of 
youth  is  divided  into  hundreds  of  tusovki  (sing.,  tusovka),  mutu- 
ally exclusive  social  circles  that  provide  a  sense  of  identity  but 
isolate  their  members  from  the  rest  of  society.  What  the  tusovki 


244 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


have  in  common  are  decadence,  an  appetite  for  risk,  and  a 
readiness  to  indulge  in  faddish  forms  of  mass  behavior. 

Wages  and  Work 

In  the  post-Soviet  era,  social  mobility  is  unlimited  in  theory, 
but  in  the  mid-1990s  economic  factors  play  an  important  role 
in  restricting  upward  movement  for  most  Russians.  Those  with- 
out an  established  source  of  wealth  generally  are  unable  to  pur- 
chase land,  real  estate,  or  enterprises,  or  to  take  advantage  of 
other  financial  opportunities  to  increase  their  income  and  sta- 
tus. Because  individuals  under  such  limitations  also  lack  oppor- 
tunities to  pursue  higher  education,  they  tend  to  remain  at  or 
below  the  socioeconomic  level  of  their  parents.  In  many  cases, 
the  younger  generation  has  less  earning  power  than  the  one 
that  preceded  it. 

In  1995  official  government  estimates  placed  39  million  peo- 
ple, or  26  percent  of  the  population,  below  the  poverty  line. 
Living  standards,  which  dropped  drastically  in  1992,  recovered 
somewhat  in  1993  and  1994  before  falling  again  in  1995  as  the 
government  tightened  its  social  support  spending  policy  (see 
Social  Welfare,  this  ch.;  table  11,  Appendix).  Other  factors, 
such  as  inflation,  changes  in  the  minimum  wage  and  minimum 
pension,  and  income  from  nonwage  sources  such  as  business 
activity  and  property,  also  influence  annual  income  in  a  given 
period.  Raised  in  mid-1994,  then  not  again  until  April  1995, 
the  minimum  wage  has  provided  little  protection  against  inter- 
mittent periods  of  high  inflation.  Official  income  statistics  are 
skewed  because  many  Russians  underreport  their  incomes  to 
avoid  taxes  and  because  such  statistics  ignore  important  nonin- 
come  sources  of  well-being  such  as  property. 

The  real  incomes  of  state-sector  employees  fell  as  much  as  30 
percent  in  the  first  three  quarters  of  1995.  Wages  in  the  private 
sector  have  kept  pace  with  inflation  more  consistently,  unless 
an  enterprise  has  financial  difficulties  such  as  debts  owed  to 
other  enterprises.  In  both  sectors,  long-term  failure  to  pay 
wages  has  become  a  chronic  problem;  it  affected  an  estimated 
13  million  people  in  mid-1995.  Enterprises  also  have 
responded  to  financial  difficulties  by  laying  off  employees  and 
by  shortening  work  weeks,  pushing  more  workers  below  the 
poverty  line.  Although  many  of  the  working  poor  retain  the 
housing,  health,  and  free  holidays  associated  with  employment, 
enterprises  are  rapidly  withdrawing  those  Soviet-era  privileges.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  economic  condition  of  many  Russians  is  ameliorated  by 
earnings  from  additional  jobs  or  by  access  to  private  plots  of 
land.  In  a  1994  survey,  47  percent  of  respondents  reported 
some  form  of  additional  material  support,  and  23  percent 
reported  having  supplementary  employment.  In  some  cases, 
unofficial  employment  is  quite  profitable.  Of  the  "working 
unemployed,"  Russians  who  consider  themselves  out  of  work 
but  nevertheless  hold  some  sort  of  job,  11  percent  had  incomes 
at  least  three  times  higher  than  the  average  wage  in  1994.  The 
large  number  of  pensioners  with  unofficial  jobs  (approxi- 
mately one  in  four)  generally  fare  much  better  than  those  on 
fixed  incomes,  generating  a  disparity  of  status  within  the  oldest 
segment  of  society.  The  easing  of  travel  restrictions  in  post- 
Soviet  Russia  and  the  overall  diversification  of  the  private  sec- 
tor increased  opportunities  to  earn  supplementary  income, 
through  such  activities  as  buying  goods  abroad  and  selling 
them  inside  Russia  and  offering  a  variety  of  private  services 
such  as  repair  work,  sewing,  and  translation.  In  general,  these 
opportunities  are  most  accessible  to  young,  well-educated  Rus- 
sians in  large  cities.  But  in  many  cases,  well-educated  individu- 
als must  sacrifice  their  social  status  by  accepting  unskilled  jobs 
to  make  ends  meet. 

Some  professional  positions  that  are  accorded  high  prestige 
carry  a  salary  below  that  for  certain  categories  of  skilled  labor. 
The  upper  echelons  of  the  political,  artistic,  and  scientific  elites 
form  the  top  of  the  occupation  pyramid  in  terms  of  status  and 
income.  That  category  is  followed  by  the  professional,  intellec- 
tual, and  artistic  intelligentsia;  the  most  highly  skilled  indus- 
trial workers;  white-collar  workers;  relatively  prosperous 
farmers;  and  average  workers.  The  bottom  of  the  status  and  pay 
scales  includes  people  employed  as  semiskilled  or  unskilled 
workers  in  light  industry,  agriculture,  food  processing,  educa- 
tion, health  care,  retail  trade,  and  the  services  sector. 

Among  the  low-paying  jobs  are  some  that  require  higher  or 
specialized  education  and  that  carry  some  level  of  prestige. 
Women  predominate  in  these  job  categories,  which  include 
engineers,  veterinarians,  agronomists,  accountants,  legal  advis- 
ers, translators,  schoolteachers,  librarians,  organizers  of  clubs 
and  cultural  events,  musicians,  and  even  doctors.  A  1994  World 
Bank  report  identified  an  increasing  likelihood  that  positions 
offering  lower  wages  would  be  filled  by  women,  in  most  sectors 
and  occupations  of  the  Russian  economy.  Many  women,  how- 
ever, reportedly  accept  jobs  at  lower  levels  of  skill  and  remuner-

ation  in  exchange  for  nonmonetary  benefits,  such  as  short 
commuting  distances,  minimum  overtime  hours,  and  access  to 
child  care  or  shopping  facilities  in  the  workplace  (see  The  Role 
of  Women,  this  ch.). 

Rural  Life 

For  rural  society  in  both  Soviet  and  post-Soviet  times,  agri- 
culture has  been  the  primary  source  of  employment.  Before 
1992,  however,  the  CPSU  and  its  predecessors  constituted  the 
sole  form  of  political  organization,  and  all  village  communities 
were  organized  around  the  economic  institution  of  the  collec- 
tive farm  (kolkhoz — see  Glossary)  or  state  farm  (sovkhoz — see 
Glossary)  and  the  village  soviet  (council)  administration — 
organizations  that  employed  the  elite  of  rural  society,  nearly  all 
of  whose  members  were  men. 

As  in  the  past,  the  post-Soviet  nonpolitical  elite  includes 
schoolteachers,  agronomists,  veterinary  surgeons,  and  engi- 
neers. Teachers  are  held  in  high  esteem,  partly  because  of  their 
role  in  determining  who  in  the  next  generation  will  have 
upward  social  mobility.  Despite  this  status,  teachers  receive  low 
pay  and  often  must  maintain  private  garden  plots  to  support 
themselves.  Agricultural  machinery  specialists,  including  oper- 
ators and  mechanics,  emerged  as  increasingly  important  and 
well-paid  members  of  rural  society  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  In 
general,  however,  workers  who  remain  in  the  countryside  have 
less  possibility  of  upward  mobility  than  do  urban  dwellers.  Man- 
agers and  white-collar  workers  in  rural  agricultural  and  other 
organizations  generally  are  brought  in  from  outside. 

Rural  dwellers  tend  to  spend  more  time  in  their  homes  than 
residents  of  urban  areas.  Rural  homes  generally  are  larger  than 
those  in  the  city  and  have  private  garden  plots.  The  tastes  of 
country  people  are  simpler  and  less  Western-oriented  than 
those  of  their  urban  counterparts,  and  they  have  less  money  to 
spend  on  leisure  pursuits.  The  routine  of  life  in  many  rural  vil- 
lages has  scarcely  changed  over  many  generations;  the  central 
concerns  continue  to  be  the  weather  and  the  condition  of 
crops  and  livestock. 

The  end  of  Soviet  rule  cast  a  shadow  over  the  villages'  guar- 
antee of  medical  care,  job  training,  and  entertainment,  and 
rural  areas  benefited  much  less  from  the  increased  pace  of 
information  exchange  characteristic  of  urban  centers.  Rural 
young  people  continue  to  leave  their  families  to  seek  a  better 
life  elsewhere  because  village  life  has  improved  little  since  their 


247

grandparents  were  young.  In  this  process,  the  family,  the  foun- 
dation of  peasant  society,  has  become  fragmented.  Villages 
with  fewer  than  1,000  inhabitants  are  disappearing  at  a  rapid 
rate:  between  1960  and  1995,  the  entire  population  of  an  esti- 
mated two-thirds  of  such  villages  either  died  or  moved  away.  In 
the  remaining  rural  villages,  health  care  and  education  are 
increasingly  inadequate,  and  essential  commodities  such  as 
propane  gas  have  become  extremely  expensive. 

Many  young  people  return  to  their  rural  homes  after  acquir- 
ing the  type  of  education  or  technical  training  that  is  available 
only  in  cities  and  that  is  increasingly  necessary  to  run  mecha- 
nized farming  operations  and  agroindustrial  enterprises.  They 
are  joined  by  Russian  emigres  from  former  Soviet  republics, 
especially  Central  Asia,  for  whom  it  is  easier  to  start  life  in  Rus- 
sia in  a  rural  rather  than  an  urban  setting.  However,  most  of 
those  additions  to  the  rural  population  are  only  stopping  tem- 
porarily until  they  find  more  satisfying  situations  elsewhere. 
According  to  most  experts,  the  long-term  prospects  of  the  tra- 
ditional Russian  village  became  grim  in  the  immediate  post- 
Soviet  period. 

Social  Organizations 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  structure  of  Russia's  civil  society  was 
still  in  flux,  but  by  that  time  the  country  had  developed  a  large 
and  growing  network  of  social  organizations,  including  trade 
unions,  professional  societies,  veterans'  groups,  youth  organiza- 
tions, sports  clubs,  women's  associations,  and  a  variety  of  sup- 
port groups.  Whereas  all  types  of  organization  during  the 
Soviet  era  functioned  as  "transmission  belts"  for  the  communist 
party,  in  the  years  that  followed  the  emergence  of  a  large  num- 
ber of  diverse,  autonomous  nongovernmental  groups  was  an 
important  aspect  of  the  growth  of  civil  society. 

The  Federation  of  Independent  Trade  Unions  of  Russia 
(Federatsiya  nezavisimykh  profsoyuzov  Rossii — FNPR)  is  one  of 
the  largest  trade  union  organizations.  Created  as  the  official 
trade  union  movement  was  reconstituted  following  the  disinte- 
gration of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  federation  includes  thirty-six 
unions — many  of  them  quite  small  in  the  mid-1990s — grouped 
by  type  of  occupation.  Among  the  FNPR's  activities  is  the  col- 
lection of  contributions  to  the  Social  Insurance  Fund  by  Rus- 
sia's enterprises,  each  of  which  is  required  to  earmark  4.5 
percent  of  its  total  payroll  for  the  fund. 


248 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Breaking  the  legal  stranglehold  of  the  Soviet-era  trade  union 
structure  on  the  provision  of  social  security  benefits  was  a  com- 
plicated but  essential  stage  in  enabling  new  unions  to  gain 
legitimacy  in  the  eyes  of  workers.  In  the  early  1990s,  most  work- 
ers saw  the  FNPR  as  representing  the  interests  of  management 
and  the  government,  so  they  relied  more  heavily  on  unofficial, 
independent  unions  and  a  variety  of  worker-oriented  organiza- 
tions. However,  in  1995  and  early  1996  the  FNPR,  now  a  part- 
ner with  top  businesspeople  in  an  umbrella  party  called  Trade 
Unions  and  Industrialists  of  Russia,  played  a  central  role  in 
organizing  large-scale  rallies  and  picketing  actions  to  protest 
chronic  late  wage  payments  by  enterprises  all  over  the  Russian 
Federation. 

In  the  1990s,  substantial  independent  union  activity  has  also 
occurred  in  the  coal  industry.  There,  the  Independent  Miners' 
Union  (Nezavisimyy  profsoyuz  gornyakov — NPG)  and  the 
Independent  Trade  Union  of  Workers  in  the  Coal-Mining 
Industry  (Nezavisimyy  profsoyuz  rabochikh  ugol'noy  promy- 
shlennosti — NPRUP),  a  reformed  version  of  the  official  Soviet- 
era  trade  union,  share  power  and  have  organized  large-scale 
strikes. 

In  the  1990s,  independent  individuals  and  groups  have 
begun  establishing  professional,  research,  educational,  and 
cultural  organizations.  This  activity  has  included  a  substantial 
upswing  in  the  number  of  voluntary  charitable  and  philan- 
thropic organizations.  In  1995  about  5,000  nonprofit  organiza- 
tions and  550  formal  charities  were  operating  in  Russia.  In 
Moscow  more  than  10,000  volunteers  worked  for  these  organi- 
zations in  1996.  These  numbers  are  low  by  Western  standards, 
and  a  legal  framework  for  the  existence  of  charities  and  non- 
profit organizations  still  did  not  exist  as  of  mid-1996.  However, 
the  starting  point  in  1992  was  nearly  zero  in  both  categories. 

A  significant  token  of  citizen  awareness  is  the  proliferation 
of  local  and  regional  ecological  and  environmental  cleanup 
groups  throughout  the  Russian  Federation  (see  The  Response 
to  Environmental  Problems,  ch.  3) .  For  example,  Epitsentr,  an 
umbrella  organization  in  St.  Petersburg,  has  spawned  numer- 
ous smaller  groups  that  focus  on  controlling  pollution  in  the 
city's  water  supply,  stopping  the  construction  of  a  controversial 
dam  in  the  Gulf  of  Finland,  and  preserving  St.  Petersburg's  his- 
toric buildings  and  cultural  monuments.  Students  at  Moscow 
State  University  and  other  educational  institutions  have  played 
an  important  role  in  directing  public  attention  to  the  massive 


249 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

environmental  degradation  that  plagues  Russia.  The  Socio-Eco- 
logical  Union,  which  was  founded  at  Moscow  State  University 
in  1988,  has  become  one  of  the  Russian  Federation's  most 
influential  umbrella  organizations  committed  to  environmen- 
tal protection. 

The  Family 

As  the  Soviet  Union  became  urbanized,  families  grew  more 
numerous  and  smaller  in  average  size.  Between  the  censuses  of 
1959  and  1989,  the  number  of  family  units  increased  41  per- 
cent, from  28.5  million  to  more  than  40  million.  Average  family 
size  in  the  Russian  Republic  declined  from  3.4  persons  in  1970 
to  3.1  in  1989.  Already  in  the  late  1970s,  more  than  80  percent 
of  urban  families  had  two  children  or  fewer.  In  1989  some  87 
percent  of  the  population  lived  in  families,  of  which  about  80 
percent  were  based  on  a  married  couple. 

In  the  1980s,  the  divorce  rate  in  the  Soviet  Union  was  second 
in  the  world  only  to  that  of  the  United  States,  although  "unoffi- 
cial divorces"  and  separations  also  were  common.  Crowded 
housing  and  lack  of  privacy  contributed  heavily  to  the  divorce 
rate,  especially  for  couples  forced  to  live  with  the  parents  of 
one  spouse.  Drunkenness  and  infidelity  were  other  major 
causes.  Divorce  procedures  were  relatively  simple,  although 
courts  generally  attempted  to  reconcile  couples.  Custody  of 
children  normally  was  awarded  to  the  mother.  In  the  first  half 
of  the  1990s,  the  conditions  contributing  to  the  majority  of 
Russia's  divorces  did  not  change,  and  the  divorce  rate 
increased. 

In  post-Soviet  attitudes,  the  family  continues  to  be  viewed  as 
the  most  important  institution  in  society.  In  a  1994  poll  funded 
by  the  Commission  on  Women's,  Family,  and  Demographic 
Problems,  less  than  3  percent  of  respondents  named  "living 
alone  without  a  family"  as  the  best  choice  for  a  young  person. 
Although  the  size  of  the  average  Russian  family  has  decreased 
steadily  over  the  past  quarter-century,  nearly  80  percent  of 
respondents  named  children  as  the  essential  element  of  a  good 
marriage.  At  the  same  time,  about  three-quarters  of  respon- 
dents said  that  a  bad  marriage  should  be  terminated  rather 
than  prolonged;  the  poll  also  showed  that,  generally,  the  Rus- 
sian attitude  toward  divorce  is  more  positive  than  it  was  in  the 
Soviet  era. 

According  to  the  1994  survey,  the  dynamics  of  the  average 
Russian  family  have  changed  somewhat.  Compared  with  1989, 


250 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


about  3  percent  fewer  individuals  characterized  their  mar- 
riages as  in  conflict,  and  9  percent  fewer  called  their  marriages 
"egalitarian"  in  the  distribution  of  authority  between  the  part- 
ners. The  average  distribution  of  common  household  tasks  was 
shown  to  be  far  from  equal,  with  women  performing  an  aver- 
age of  about  75  percent  of  cooking,  cleaning,  and  shopping 
chores.  Between  1989  and  1994,  women's  expression  of  dissatis- 
faction with  their  family  situation  increased  13  percent,  while 
that  of  men  rose  only  2  percent.  Women  reporting  family  satis- 
faction were  predominantly  young  or  elderly,  with  adequate-to- 
high  incomes  and  at  least  a  secondary  education.  According  to 
experts,  social  and  economic  crises  have  caused  Russians  to 
rely  more  heavily  than  ever  on  the  family  as  a  source  of  per- 
sonal satisfaction.  But  these  same  crises  have  caused  the  stan- 
dard of  living  to  fall,  and  they  have  required  that  more  time  be 
spent  at  work  to  keep  it  from  falling  further,  thus  making  it 
harder  for  families  to  sustain  their  most  cherished  attributes. 

The  Role  of  Women 

In  the  post-Soviet  era,  the  position  of  women  in  Russian  soci- 
ety remains  at  least  as  problematic  as  it  was  in  previous  decades. 
In  both  cases,  a  number  of  nominal  legal  protections  for 
women  either  have  failed  to  address  the  existing  conditions  or 
have  failed  to  supply  adequate  support.  In  the  1990s,  increas- 
ing economic  pressures  and  shrinking  government  programs 
left  women  with  little  choice  but  to  seek  employment,  although 
most  available  positions  were  as  substandard  as  in  the  Soviet 
period,  and  generally  jobs  of  any  sort  were  more  difficult  to 
obtain.  Such  conditions  contribute  heavily  to  Russia's  declining 
birthrate  and  the  general  deterioration  of  the  family.  At  the 
same  time,  feminist  groups  and  social  organizations  have 
begun  advancing  the  cause  of  women's  rights  in  what  remains  a 
strongly  traditional  society. 

The  Soviet  constitution  of  1977  stipulated  that  men  and 
women  have  equal  rights,  and  that  women  have  equal  access  to 
education  and  training,  employment,  promotions,  remunera- 
tion, and  participation  in  social,  cultural,  and  political  activity. 
The  Soviet  government  also  provided  women  special  medical 
and  workplace  protection,  including  incentives  for  mothers  to 
work  outside  the  home  and  legal  and  material  support  of  their 
maternal  role.  In  the  1980s,  that  support  included  112  days  of 
maternity  leave  at  full  pay.  When  that  allowance  ended,  a 
woman  could  take  as  much  as  one  year  of  additional  leave  with- 


251

out  pay  without  losing  her  position.  Employer  discrimination 
against  pregnant  and  nursing  women  was  prohibited,  and 
mothers  with  small  children  had  the  right  to  work  part-time. 
Because  of  such  provisions,  as  many  as  92  percent  of  women 
were  employed  at  least  part-time,  Soviet  statistics  showed. 

Despite  official  ideology,  Soviet  women  did  not  enjoy  the 
same  position  as  men  in  society  or  within  the  family.  Average 
pay  for  women  in  all  fields  was  below  the  overall  national  aver- 
age, and  the  vaunted  high  percentage  of  women  in  various 
fields,  especially  health  care,  medicine,  education,  and  eco- 
nomics, did  not  hold  true  in  the  most  prestigious  and  high-pay- 
ing areas  such  as  the  upper  management  of  organizations  in 
any  of  those  fields.  Women  were  conspicuously  underrepre- 
sented  in  the  leadership  of  the  CPSU;  in  the  1980s,  they  consti- 
tuted less  than  30  percent  of  party  membership  and  less  than  5 
percent  of  the  party  Central  Committee,  and  no  woman  ever 
achieved  full  membership  in  the  Politburo. 

Most  of  the  nominal  state  benefit  programs  for  women  con- 
tinued into  the  post-Soviet  era  (see  Social  Welfare,  this  ch.). 
However,  as  in  the  Soviet  era,  Russian  women  in  the  1990s  pre- 
dominate in  economic  sectors  where  pay  is  low,  and  they  con- 
tinue to  receive  less  pay  than  men  for  comparable  positions.  In 

1995  men  in  health  care  earned  an  average  of  50  percent  more 
than  women  in  that  field,  and  male  engineers  received  an  aver- 
age of  40  percent  more  than  their  female  colleagues.  Despite 
the  fact  that,  on  average,  women  are  better  educated  than 
men,  women  remain  in  the  minority  in  senior  management 
positions.  In  the  Soviet  era,  women's  wages  averaged  70  per- 
cent of  men's;  by  1995  the  figure  was  40  percent,  according  to 
the  Moscow-based  Center  for  Gender  Studies.  According  to  a 

1996  report,  87  percent  of  employed  urban  Russians  earning 
less  than  100,000  rubles  a  month  (for  value  of  the  ruble — see 
Glossary)  were  women,  and  the  percentage  of  women 
decreased  consistently  in  the  higher  wage  categories. 

According  to  reports,  women  generally  are  the  first  to  be 
fired,  and  they  face  other  forms  of  on-the-job  discrimination  as 
well.  Struggling  companies  often  fire  women  to  avoid  paying 
child  care  benefits  or  granting  maternity  leave,  as  the  law  still 
requires.  In  1995  women  constituted  an  estimated  70  percent 
of  Russia's  unemployed,  and  as  much  as  90  percent  in  some 
areas. 

Sociological  surveys  show  that  sexual  harassment  and  vio- 
lence against  women  have  increased  at  all  levels  of  society  in 


252 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  1990s.  More  than  13,000  rapes  were  reported  in  1994, 
meaning  that  several  times  that  number  of  that  often-unre- 
ported  crime  probably  were  committed.  In  1993  an  estimated 
14,000  women  were  murdered  by  their  husbands  or  lovers, 
about  twenty  times  the  figure  in  the  United  States  and  several 
times  the  figure  in  Russia  five  years  earlier.  More  than  300,000 
other  types  of  crimes,  including  spousal  abuse,  were  committed 
against  women  in  1994;  in  1996  the  State  Duma  (the  lower 
house  of  the  Federal  Assembly,  Russia's  parliament)  drafted  a 
law  against  domestic  violence. 

Working  women  continue  to  bear  the  "double  burden"  of  a 
job  and  family-raising  responsibilities,  in  which  Russian  hus- 
bands generally  participate  little.  In  a  1994  survey,  about  two- 
thirds  of  women  said  that  the  state  should  help  families  by  pay- 
ing one  spouse  enough  to  permit  the  other  to  stay  at  home. 
Most  women  also  consider  their  role  in  the  family  more  diffi- 
cult than  that  of  their  husband.  Such  dissatisfaction  is  a  factor 
in  Russia's  accelerating  divorce  rate  and  declining  marriage 
rate.  In  1993  the  divorce  rate  was  4.5  per  1,000  population, 
compared  with  4.1  ten  years  earlier,  and  the  marriage  rate 
declined  from  10.5  per  1,000  population  in  1983  to  7.5  in  1993. 
In  1992  some  17.2  percent  of  births  were  to  unmarried  women. 
According  to  1994  government  statistics,  about  20  percent  of 
families  were  run  by  a  single  parent — the  mother  in  94  percent 
of  cases. 

Often  women  with  families  are  forced  to  work  because  of 
insufficient  state  child  allowances  and  unemployment  benefits. 
Economic  hardship  has  driven  some  women  into  prostitution. 
In  the  Soviet  period,  prostitution  was  viewed  officially  as  a  form 
of  social  deviancy  that  was  dying  out  as  the  Soviet  Union 
advanced  toward  communism.  In  the  1990s,  organized  crime 
has  become  heavily  involved  in  prostitution,  both  in  Russia  and 
in  the  cities  of  Central  and  Western  Europe,  to  which  Russian 
women  often  are  lured  by  bogus  advertisements  for  match- 
making services  or  modeling  agencies.  According  to  one  esti- 
mate, 10,000  women  from  Central  Europe,  including  a  high 
proportion  of  Russians,  have  been  lured  or  forced  into  prosti- 
tution in  Germany  alone. 

Independent  women's  organizations — a  form  of  activity  that 
was  suppressed  in  the  Soviet  era — have  been  formed  in  large 
numbers  in  the  1990s  at  the  local,  regional,  and  national  levels. 
One  such  group  is  the  Center  for  Gender  Studies,  a  private 
research  institute.  The  center  analyzes  demographic  and  social 


253

problems  of  women  and  acts  as  a  link  between  Russian  and 
Western  feminist  groups.  A  traveling  group  called  Feminist 
Alternative  offers  women  assertiveness  training.  Many  local 
groups  have  emerged  to  engage  in  court  actions  on  behalf  of 
women,  to  set  up  rape  and  domestic  violence  awareness  pro- 
grams (about  a  dozen  of  which  were  active  in  1995),  and  to  aid 
women  in  establishing  businesses.  Another  prominent  organi- 
zation is  the  Women's  Union  of  Russia,  which  focuses  on  job- 
training  programs,  career  counseling,  and  the  development  of 
entrepreneurial  skills  that  will  enable  women  to  compete  more 
successfully  in  Russia's  emerging  market  economy.  Despite  the 
proliferation  of  such  groups  and  programs,  in  the  mid-1990s 
most  Russians  (including  many  women)  remain  contemptuous 
of  their  efforts,  which  many  regard  as  a  kind  of  Western  subver- 
sion of  traditional  social  values. 

The  rapidly  expanding  private  sector  offers  women  new 
employment  opportunities,  but  many  of  the  Soviet  stereotypes 
remain;  the  most  frequently  offered  job  in  new  businesses  is 
that  of  secretary,  and  advertisements  often  specify  physical 
attractiveness  as  a  primary  requirement.  Russian  law  provides 
for  as  much  as  three  years'  imprisonment  for  sexual  harass- 
ment, but  the  law  rarely  is  enforced.  Although  the  Fund  for 
Protection  from  Sexual  Harassment  has  blacklisted  300  Mos- 
cow firms  where  sexual  harassment  is  known  to  have  taken 
place,  demands  for  sex  and  even  rape  still  are  common  on-the- 
job  occurrences. 

Women's  higher  profile  in  post-Soviet  Russia  also  has 
extended  to  politics.  At  the  national  level,  the  most  notable 
manifestation  of  women's  newfound  political  success  has  been 
the  Women  of  Russia  party,  which  won  11  percent  of  the  vote 
and  twenty-five  seats  in  the  1993  national  parliamentary  elec- 
tions. Subsequently,  the  party  became  active  in  a  number  of 
issues,  including  the  opposition  to  the  military  campaign  in 
Chechnya  that  began  in  1994.  In  the  1995  national  parliamen- 
tary elections,  the  Women  of  Russia  chose  to  maintain  its  plat- 
form  unchanged,  emphasizing  social  issues  such  as  the 
protection  of  children  and  women  rather  than  entering  into  a 
coalition  with  other  liberal  parties.  As  a  result,  the  party  failed 
to  reach  the  5  percent  threshold  of  votes  required  for  propor- 
tional representation  in  the  new  State  Duma,  gaining  only 
three  seats  in  the  single-seat  portion  of  the  elections  (see  The 
Elections  of  1995,  ch.  7).  The  party  considered  running  a  can- 


254 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


didate  in  the  1996  presidential  election  but  remained  outside 
the  crowded  field. 

A  smaller  organization,  the  Russian  Women's  Party,  ran  as 
part  of  an  unsuccessful  coalition  with  several  other  splinter  par- 
ties in  the  1995  elections.  A  few  women,  such  as  Ella  Pamfilova 
of  the  Republican  Party,  Socialist  Workers'  Party  chief  Lyudmila 
Vartazarova,  and  Valeriya  Novodvorskaya,  leader  of  the  Demo- 
cratic Union,  have  established  themselves  as  influential  politi- 
cal figures.  Pamfilova  has  gained  particular  stature  as  an 
advocate  on  behalf  of  women  and  elderly  people. 

The  Soldiers'  Mothers  Movement  was  formed  in  1989  to 
expose  human  rights  violations  in  the  armed  forces  and  to  help 
youths  resist  the  draft.  The  movement  has  gained  national 
prominence  through  its  opposition  to  the  war  in  Chechnya. 
Numerous  protests  have  been  organized,  and  representatives 
have  gone  to  the  Chechen  capital,  Groznyy,  to  demand  the 
release  of  Russian  prisoners  and  locate  missing  soldiers.  The 
group,  which  claimed  10,000  members  in  1995,  also  has  lob- 
bied against  extending  the  term  of  mandatory  military  service. 

Women  have  occupied  few  positions  of  influence  in  the 
executive  branch  of  Russia's  national  government.  One  post  in 
the  Government  (cabinet),  that  of  minister  of  social  protec- 
tion, has  become  a  "traditional"  women's  position;  in  1994  Ella 
Pamfilova  was  followed  in  that  position  by  Lyudmila  Bezlep- 
kina,  who  headed  the  ministry  until  the  end  of  President  Boris 
N.  Yeltsin's  first  term  in  mid-1996.  Tat'yana  Paramanova  was 
acting  chairman  of  the  Russian  Central  Bank  for  one  year 
before  Yeltsin  replaced  her  in  November  1995,  and  Tat'yana 
Regent  has  been  head  of  the  Federal  Migration  Service  since 
its  inception  in  1992.  Prior  to  the  1995  elections,  women  held 
about  10  percent  of  the  seats  in  parliament:  fifty-seven  of  450 
seats  in  the  State  Duma  and  nine  of  178  seats  in  the  upper 
house  of  parliament,  the  Federation  Council.  The  Soviet  sys- 
tem of  mandating  legislative  seats  generally  allocated  about 
one-third  of  the  seats  in  republic-level  legislatures  and  one-half 
of  the  seats  in  local  Soviets  to  women,  but  those  proportions 
shrank  drastically  with  the  first  multiparty  elections  of  1990. 

Sexual  Attitudes 

In  the  1990s,  Russian  sexual  values  and  attitudes  generally 
moved  toward  liberalization  and  autonomy,  with  distinct  differ- 
ences according  to  age,  sex,  region,  and  level  of  education.  In 
the  Soviet  era,  the  Russian  attitude  toward  sexuality  itself  paral- 


255 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


leled  that  toward  artistic  expression  of  the  erotic:  it  simply  was 
concealed.  Most  Soviet  philosophical,  psychological,  and  bio- 
logical reference  works  made  little  or  no  mention  of  sexuality 
as  a  major  characteristic  of  human  beings.  Soviet  psychology, 
notoriously  backward  and  misused,  ignored  almost  completely 
the  influence  of  sexual  behavior  and  motivation  on  overall  psy- 
chological makeup. 

After  decades  of  Stalinist  repression,  Russian  erotic  art,  liter- 
ature, and  theater  began  a  gradual  revival  in  the  1970s  as  cen- 
sorship and  ideological  control  weakened  somewhat.  Access  to 
Western  novels  with  erotic  motifs,  such  as  Henry  Miller's  Tropic 
of  Cancer  and  Vladimir  Nabokov's  Lolita,  also  improved  in  this 
period.  In  1992  restrictions  on  the  publication  of  erotic  litera- 
ture were  loosened  in  Russia,  heralding  a  rapid  output  of  erotic 
and  pornographic  material  of  all  sorts.  A  collection  of  chil- 
dren's erotic  folklore  was  prepared  in  1995,  and  erotic  film  fes- 
tivals and  photography  exhibits  began  to  appear  in  the  1990s. 
The  public  seemingly  has  accepted  the  frequent  use  of  nudity 
in  Russian  television,  dance,  and  drama. 

Especially  in  film  and  literature,  the  shift  has  produced 
many  instances  of  gratuitous  or  cruel  sex  and  arbitrarily  intro- 
duced nudity.  Violence  against  women  frequently  is  a  central 
motif  of  movies,  and  violence  and  sex  often  are  linked.  Russian 
observers  have  expressed  alarm  that  the  release  of  long- 
repressed  sexual  expression  in  art  will  be  accompanied  by  a 
similar  deluge  of  sex  and  violence  in  Russian  society.  Indeed, 
the  incidence  of  violence  and  sexual  attacks  against  women  in 
the  first  half  of  the  1990s  seems  to  confirm  these  fears  (see  The 
Role  of  Women,  this  ch.). 

Objections  to  the  trend  toward  sexual  liberation  are  concen- 
trated in  the  older  generations.  In  surveys  younger  and  better- 
educated  Russians  generally  voice  approval,  and  new  enter- 
prises selling  cosmetics,  high-fashion  clothing,  and  health 
products  play  to  a  new  public  interest  in  attractive  display  of 
the  human  body.  The  individuality  implicit  in  such  market- 
ing— and  especially  obvious  in  the  new  Russian  youth  culture — 
is  a  drastic  change  from  the  strict  standards  of  dress  and 
grooming  imposed  in  the  Soviet  era.  The  wearing  of  shorts,  for 
example,  only  was  accepted  in  Russia  in  the  1980s;  in  the  Soviet 
era,  women  could  not  wear  trousers  in  public  without  harass- 
ment or  arrest;  and  vigilantes  often  forcibly  cut  the  hair  of 
youths  who  exceeded  the  standard  for  hair  length. 


256 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


According  to  surveys  taken  in  the  early  1990s,  most  Russians 
feel  that  romantic  love  is  a  precondition  to  marriage  and  to 
sexual  intimacy.  But  there  are  great  differences  in  attitude 
toward  this  ideal  between  the  older  and  younger  generations, 
between  the  sexes,  and  between  rural  and  urban  Russians.  Rus- 
sians in  larger  cities  tend  to  take  a  more  liberal  outlook  on  pre- 
marital sex.  The  younger  generations  in  Russia  show  a  much 
more  casual  attitude  toward  commitment  to  a  long-term  rela- 
tionship than  do  the  older  generations.  However,  in  surveys 
younger  males  showed  a  much  stronger  identification  of  sex 
with  pleasure,  and  younger  females  a  stronger  identification  of 
sex  with  love.  Russians'  attitudes  toward  premarital  sex  became 
somewhat  more  liberal  in  the  1990s;  in  a  1993  survey,  the  per- 
centage of  those  disapproving  was  substantially  lower  than  it 
had  been  in  previous  years. 

The  official  policy  of  the  Soviet  Union  toward  homosexuality 
was  one  of  persecution  and  intimidation.  Until  the  late  1980s, 
Russian  social  scientists  and  society  in  general  were  completely 
silent  on  the  subject.  Under  those  conditions,  homosexuals, 
known  as  "blues,"  lived  in  an  underground  culture  circum- 
scribed by  the  brutality  of  gangs  and  the  police  and  by  employ- 
ment discrimination. 

With  the  advent  of  glasnost  and  the  appearance  of  acquired 
immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  in  the  Soviet  Union, 
open  scientific  and  journalistic  discussion  of  homosexuality 
began  in  1987.  The  issue  became  politicized  in  1990  as  gays 
and  lesbians  began  attacking  discrimination  as  a  human  rights 
issue.  At  this  point,  strong  arguments  appeared  for  abolishing 
Article  121  of  the  Criminal  Code,  which  stipulated  that  sex 
between  men  (but  not  between  women)  was  a  crime.  Despite 
increasingly  strong  opinion  against  Article  121,  in  the  early 
1990s  nationalists  and  communists  joined  some  religious  orga- 
nizations in  opposing  decriminalization.  Meanwhile,  the  num- 
ber of  convictions  under  Article  121  decreased  steadily. 
Although  Russia's  new  Criminal  Code  had  not  been  ratified  as 
of  mid-1996,  substantial  modifications  had  been  made  to  Arti- 
cle 121  by  that  time. 

Hundreds  of  gay  rights  organizations  appeared  in  Russia  in 
the  1990s,  mostly  in  urban  centers.  Moscow  became  the  center 
of  Russia's  gay  and  lesbian  communities,  both  of  which 
remained  substantially  less  overt  than  their  Western  equiva- 
lents. Despite  a  gradual  increase  in  public  tolerance  in  the 
1990s,  substantial  residues  of  homophobia  remain  in  Russian 


257 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


society.  The  neofascist  group  Pamyat',  for  example,  remained 
violently  antigay  in  the  mid-1990s,  and  the  communist  and 
extreme  nationalist  media  have  launched  strident  homophobic 
attacks.  In  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  numerous  surveys 
identified  homosexuals  as  the  most  hated  group  in  Russian 
society,  although  the  number  of  Russians  calling  for  their  exter- 
mination or  isolation  decreased  noticeably  between  1989  and 
the  mid-1990s. 

Education 

In  the  Soviet  period,  education  was  highly  centralized,  and 
indoctrination  in  Marxist-Leninist  theory  was  a  major  element 
of  every  school's  curriculum.  The  schools'  additional  ideologi- 
cal function  left  a  legacy  in  the  post-Soviet  system  that  has 
proved  difficult  for  educators  to  overcome.  In  the  1990s, 
reform  programs  are  aimed  at  overhauling  the  Soviet-era  peda- 
gogical philosophy  and  substantially  revising  curricula.  Inade- 
quate funding  has  frustrated  attainment  of  these  goals, 
however,  and  the  teaching  profession  has  lost  talented  individ- 
uals because  of  low  pay. 

The  Soviet  Heritage 

The  Soviet  government  operated  virtually  all  the  schools  in 
Russia.  The  underlying  philosophy  of  Soviet  schools  was  that 
the  teacher's  job  was  to  transmit  standardized  materials  to  the 
students,  and  the  student's  job  was  to  memorize  those  materi- 
als, all  of  which  were  put  in  the  context  of  socialist  ethics.  That 
set  of  ethics  stressed  the  primacy  of  the  collective  over  the 
interests  of  the  individual.  Therefore,  for  both  teachers  and 
students,  creativity  and  individualism  were  discouraged.  The 
Soviet  system  also  maintained  some  traditions  from  tsarist 
times,  such  as  the  five-point  grading  scale,  formal  and  regi- 
mented classroom  environments,  and  standard  school  uni- 
forms— dark  dresses  with  white  collars  for  girls,  white  shirts 
and  black  pants  for  boys. 

As  in  other  areas  of  Soviet  life,  the  need  for  reform  in  educa- 
tion was  felt  in  the  1980s.  Reform  programs  in  that  period 
called  for  new  curricula,  textbooks,  and  teaching  methods. 
The  chief  aim  of  those  programs  was  to  create  a  "new  school" 
that  would  better  equip  Soviet  citizens  to  deal  with  the  mod- 
ern, technologically  advanced  nation  that  Soviet  leaders  fore- 
saw in  the  future.  Nevertheless,  in  the  1980s  facilities  generally 


258 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


were  inadequate,  overcrowding  was  common,  and  equipment 
and  materials  were  in  short  supply.  The  schools  and  universities 
failed  to  supply  adequately  skilled  labor  to  almost  every  sector 
of  the  economy,  and  overgrown  bureaucracy  further  compro- 
mised education's  contribution  to  society.  At  the  same  time, 
young  Russians  became  increasingly  cynical  about  the  Marxist- 
Leninist  philosophy  they  were  forced  to  absorb,  as  well  as  the 
stifling  of  self-expression  and  individual  responsibility.  In  the 
last  years  of  the  Soviet  Union,  funding  was  inadequate  for  the 
large-scale  establishment  of  "new  schools,"  and  requirements 
of  ideological  purity  continued  to  smother  the  new  pedagogi- 
cal creativity  that  was  heralded  in  official  pronouncements. 

The  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  transition 
toward  democracy  had  a  profound  effect  on  national  educa- 
tion policy.  In  1992  a  reform  philosophy  was  set  forth  in  the 
Law  on  Education.  The  fundamental  principle  of  that  law  was 
the  removal  of  state  control  from  education  policy.  In  regions 
with  non-Russian  populations,  that  meant  that  educational 
institutions  could  base  their  curricula  and  teaching  methods 
on  national  and  historical  traditions.  In  all  regions,  enactment 
of  the  law  meant  significant  autonomy  for  local  authorities  to 
choose  education  strategies  most  appropriate  to  the  time  and 
place.  Post-Soviet  education  reform  also  stressed  teaching 
objectively,  thus  discarding  all  forms  of  the  narrow,  institu- 
tional views  that  had  dominated  the  previous  era  and  prepar- 
ing young  people  to  deal  with  all  aspects  of  the  society  they 
would  encounter  by  presenting  a  broader  interpretation  of  the 
world. 

Post-Soviet  educational  philosophy  also  has  sought  to  inte- 
grate education  with  the  production  and  economic  processes 
into  which  graduates  will  pass  in  adult  life.  Envisioning  a  pro- 
gram of  continuous  education  lasting  throughout  the  lifetime 
of  an  individual,  this  concept  has  as  its  goal  converting  the  edu- 
cation process  from  an  economic  burden  on  the  state  to  an 
engine  of  economic  progress.  Especially  important  in  this  pro- 
gram is  the  reorientation  of  vocational  training  to  complement 
the  economic  reforms  of  the  1990s.  New  systems  of  education 
for  farmers  and  various  types  of  on-the-job  training  for  adults 
have  been  introduced,  and  new  curricula  in  economics  stress 
understanding  of  market  economies. 

The  Post-Soviet  Education  Structure 

Article  43  of  the  1993  constitution  affirms  each  citizen's 


259 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

right  to  education.  It  stipulates  that  "basic  general  education  is 
compulsory"  and  that  parents  or  guardians  are  responsible  for 
ensuring  that  children  obtain  schooling.  "General  access  to 
free  preschool,  basic  general,  and  secondary  vocational  educa- 
tion in  state  or  municipal  educational  establishments  and  in 
enterprises  is  guaranteed,"  according  to  the  constitution. 
Although  such  access  continued  to  exist  in  principle  in  the 
mid-1990s,  various  components  of  the  system  were  increasingly 
inadequate.  In  1993  some  35.2  million  students  were  enrolled 
in  Russian  schools  at  all  levels,  including  20.5  million  in  gen- 
eral primary  and  secondary  schools,  1.8  million  in  professional 
and  technical  schools,  2.1  million  in  special  secondary  schools, 
and  2.6  million  in  institutions  of  higher  learning  (see  table  12, 
Appendix).  A  total  of  70,200  general  primary  and  secondary 
schools  and  82,100  preschools  were  in  operation  at  that  time. 
Of  the  former  category,  48,800  were  in  rural  areas  and  21,000 
in  urban  areas. 

In  1995  the  projected  budgetary  expenditure  for  education 
was  about  3.6  percent  of  the  total  state  budget,  a  level  Russian 
experts  agreed  could  not  maintain  the  system  as  it  was,  to  say 
nothing  of  implementing  the  changes  called  for  by  post-Soviet 
legislation.  The  financing  system  made  educational  institutions 
fully  dependent  on  state  funds;  outside  sources  of  funding  did 
not  exist  because  no  tax  advantages  accrued  from  investing  in 
education. 

Infrastructure 

Because  the  Soviet  Union  had  not  built  enough  schools  to 
accommodate  increasing  enrollment,  Russia  inherited  a  system 
of  very  large,  overcrowded  schools  with  a  decaying  infrastruc- 
ture. By  the  late  1980s,  21  percent  of  students  were  attending 
schools  with  no  central  heating,  and  30  percent  were  learning 
in  buildings  with  no  running  water.  In  1992  Russia  had  nearly 
67,000  primary  and  secondary  schools,  which  provided  an  aver- 
age per-pupil  space  of  2.6  square  meters,  one-third  the  official 
standard.  About  one-quarter  of  schools  housed  900  or  more 
students.  In  1993  Russia  was  forced  to  close  about  20,000  of  its 
schools  because  of  physical  inadequacy,  and  an  estimated  one- 
third  of  the  national  school  capacity  was  in  need  of  large-scale 
repair.  In  1994  one  of  every  two  students  attended  a  school 
operating  on  two  or  three  shifts.  Rural  schools,  which  make  up 
about  75  percent  of  the  national  total,  were  in  especially  bad 
condition.

Teachers 

The  Soviet  Union  suffered  a  shortage  of  teachers  for 
decades  before  the  1990s.  Although  society  held  the  profession 
in  high  regard,  teacher  salaries  were  among  the  lowest  of  all 
professions,  at  least  partly  because  women  dominated  the  field 
at  the  primary  and  secondary  levels.  The  emerging  market 
economy  of  the  1990s  improved  the  pay  and  career  opportuni- 
ties outside  teaching  for  many  who  would  have  remained  in 
education  under  the  more  rigid  Soviet  system;  thus,  the  short- 
age was  exacerbated.  In  the  1992-93  school  year,  Russian 
schools  had  about  29,000  teacher  vacancies,  and  in  the  follow- 
ing year  25  percent  of  all  foreign-language  teaching  positions 
were  unfilled.  Although  low  pay  has  damaged  morale  among 
Russian  teachers,  they  are  more  disillusioned  by  the  end  of  the 
idealistic  first  post-Soviet  years  of  innovation  and  freedom  of 


261 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

speech  and  the  continued  decline  of  their  material  environ- 
ment. In  the  mid-1990s,  rural  schools  experienced  particular 
difficulty  retaining  teachers,  as  qualified  young  adults  sought 
opportunities  in  larger  communities. 

Curriculum 

The  end  of  the  communist  system  has  led  to  extensive  cur- 
riculum revision.  A  new  paradigm  has  been  developed  to  guide 
education,  and  more  attention  has  gone  to  the  arts,  humani- 
ties, and  social  sciences.  The  1992  Law  on  Education  stressed 
the  humanistic  nature  of  education,  common  values,  freedom 
of  human  development,  and  citizenship.  Curriculum  changes 
were  laid  out  in  another  document,  the  Basic  Curriculum  of 
the  General  Secondary  School;  the  overall  curriculum  reform 
program  is  to  be  put  in  place  over  a  five-year  period  ending  in 
1998.  In  the  mid-1990s,  many  public  schools  have  designed  spe- 
cial curricula,  some  returning  to  the  classical  studies  prevalent 
in  the  early  1900s.  Local  development  of  curricula  and  materi- 
als became  legal  in  1992,  although  financial  constraints  have 
limited  experimentation  and  the  Soviet  era  left  educators  with 
a  strong  bias  toward  standardized  instruction  and  rote  memori- 
zation. In  contrast  to  the  Soviet  era,  the  quality  and  content  of 
curricula  vary  greatly  among  public  schools.  A  major  factor 
encouraging  local  initiative  is  the  disarray  of  federal  education 
agencies,  which  often  leave  oblast,  regional,  and  municipal 
authorities  to  their  own  devices.  Nevertheless,  only  about  one- 
third  of  primary  and  secondary  schools  have  taken  advantage 
of  the  opportunity  to  develop  their  own  curricula;  many 
administrations  have  been  unwilling  to  make  such  large-scale 
decisions  independently. 

Grade  Structure 

Russian  parents  have  the  option  of  sending  their  children  to 
preschool  until  age  seven,  when  enrollment  in  elementary 
school  becomes  mandatory.  Because  the  overwhelming  major- 
ity of  mothers  still  have  full-time  employment,  many  preschool 
facilities  are  colocated  with  enterprises.  As  businesses  become 
increasingly  profit  oriented,  however,  many  have  ceased  or 
reduced  their  support  of  such  facilities.  The  number  of  child- 
care  facilities  for  working  parents  declined  significantly  after 
1991,  mainly  because  many  such  facilities  lacked  the  funding  to 
continue  operation  without  state  support.  Of  about  82,100  pre- 


262 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


schools  in  operation  in  1993,  more  than  one-third  were  housed 
in  inadequate  facilities. 

Although  the  1992  Law  on  Education  lowered  the  upper  age 
of  the  compulsory  education  range  from  seventeen  to  fifteen, 
in  the  mid-1990s  more  than  60  percent  of  students  remained  in 
school  for  the  previously  required  ten  years.  Among  Russia's 
educational  reforms  is  a  regulation  authorizing  school  officials 
to  expel  students  fourteen  years  of  age  or  older  who  are  failing 
their  courses.  By  the  end  of  1992,  about  200,000  students  had 
been  expelled,  and  two  to  three  times  that  number  had 
dropped  out.  In  the  mid-1990s,  Russia  had  five  types  of  second- 
ary school:  regular  schools  featuring  a  core  curriculum; 
schools  offering  elective  subjects;  schools  offering  intensive 
study  in  elective  subjects;  schools  designed  to  prepare  students 
for  entrance  examinations  to  an  institution  of  higher  educa- 
tion (vyssheye  uchebnoye  zavedeniye — VUZ;  pi.,  VUZy);  and  alter- 
native schools  with  experimental  programs. 

Private  Schools 

State  education  is  free,  but  by  1992  several  state  higher-edu- 
cation institutions  had  begun  charging  tuition.  At  that  point, 
almost  half  of  the  students  above  the  secondary  level  were  pay- 
ing fees  of  some  sort.  The  1992  Law  on  Education  provides 
explicitly  for  private  educational  institutions;  in  the  ensuing 
years,  several  organizations  for  private  education  have 
appeared,  and  a  variety  of  private  schools  and  colleges  have 
opened.  By  1992  about  300  nonstate  schools  were  being 
attended  by  more  than  20,000  students. 

As  public  schools  debated  what  to  do  with  their  new  aca- 
demic freedom,  private  schools  and  preschools  became  centers 
of  innovation,  with  programs  rediscovering  prerevolutionary 
pedagogy  and  freely  borrowing  teaching  methods  from  West- 
ern Europe  and  the  United  States.  Serving  largely  Western-ori- 
ented families  intent  on  making  progress  up  the  newly 
reconstructed  social  ladder,  private  schools  emphasize  learning 
English  and  other  critical  skills.  Student-to-teacher  ratios  are 
very  low,  and  teacher  salaries  average  about  US$170  per  month 
(about  three  times  the  average  for  a  public  school  teacher). 
Tuition  may  be  as  much  as  US$3,000  per  year,  but  some  private 
schools  charge  parents  according  to  their  means,  surviving 
instead  on  donations  of  money  and  time  from  wealthy  parents. 
Unlike  public  schools,  all  private  schools  must  pay  for  rent,  util-

ities,  and  textbooks,  and  many  have  struggled  to  retain  ade- 
quate building  space. 

Educational  Achievement 

The  literacy  rate  in  Russia  is  nearly  100  percent  except  in 
some  areas  dominated  by  ethnic  minorities,  where  the  rate  may 
be  considerably  lower.  According  to  the  1989  census,  three- 
fifths  of  Russia's  people  aged  fifteen  and  older  had  completed 
secondary  school,  and  8  percent  had  completed  higher  educa- 
tion. Wide  variations  in  educational  attainment  exist  between 
urban  and  rural  areas.  The  1989  census  indicated  that  two- 
thirds  of  the  country's  urban  population  aged  fifteen  and  older 
had  finished  secondary  school,  as  compared  with  just  under 
one-half  of  the  rural  population.  Schools  can  award  diplomas 
only  in  three  languages — Russian,  Tatar,  and  Bashkir — a 
requirement  that  puts  many  of  the  country's  more  than  100 
ethnic  groups  at  a  disadvantage. 

Higher  Education 

The  VUZ  category  includes  all  of  Russia's  postsecondary 
educational  institutions;  in  1995  these  totaled  about  500, 
including  forty-two  universities.  The  other  two  types  of  VUZ  are 
the  institute  and  the  polytechnic  institute.  Institutes,  the  largest 
of  the  three  groups,  train  students  in  a  specific  field  such  as  law, 
economics,  art,  agriculture,  medicine,  or  technology.  The  poly- 
technic institutes  teach  the  same  range  of  subjects  but  without 
specialization  in  a  single  area.  Most  universities  teach  the  arts 
and  pure  sciences. 

The  institute  program  consists  of  two  phases.  After  complet- 
ing two  years  of  general  studies,  a  student  receives  a  certificate; 
he  or  she  then  may  take  an  entrance  examination  to  continue 
for  two  more  years  or  terminate  the  program  and  seek  a  job. 
Completion  of  the  next  two  years  results  in  conferral  of  a  bac- 
calaureate degree.  The  next  level  of  higher  education  is  spe- 
cialized study  based  on  a  research  program  in  the  area  of 
future  professional  activity.  This  phase  lasts  at  least  two  years,  at 
the  end  of  which  the  individual  is  designated  a  specialist  in  the 
chosen  field.  The  top  level  of  higher  education  is  graduate 
work,  which  entails  a  three-year  program  of  study  and  research 
leading  to  a  degree  of  candidate  (kandidat),  then  finally  to  a 
degree  of  doctor  of  sciences  (doktor  nauk) . 

In  the  post-Soviet  era,  the  system  of  higher  education  has 
undergone  a  more  drastic  transformation  than  the  primary 


264 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


and  secondary  systems.  Authority  has  moved  from  the  center  to 
agencies  in  local  and  subnational  jurisdictions.  About  14  per- 
cent of  institutions  of  higher  learning  are  located  in  the  twenty- 
one  republics  of  the  federation  (see  table  13,  Appendix). 
Under  the  new  system,  each  VUZ  can  determine  its  own  admis- 
sions policy  and  the  content  of  its  academic  programs.  These 
institutions  also  have  their  own  financial  resources  and  statutes 
of  operation. 

Most  of  Russia's  universities  are  located  in  large  cities.  Mos- 
cow State  University,  which  was  founded  in  1755  and  has  about 
28,000  students  and  8,000  teachers,  enjoys  the  highest  reputa- 
tion. The  Russian  People's  Friendship  University  in  Moscow 
has  about  6,500  students  and  1,500  teachers,  and  St.  Petersburg 
State  University  has  about  21,000  students  and  2,100  teachers. 

The  Soviet  Union  concentrated  its  vocational  training 
resources  in  areas  such  as  space  and  military  technology.  It 
lagged  behind  the  West  in  technical  and  vocational  training  in 
other  sectors  because  of  the  practice  of  ending  students'  prepa- 
ration in  these  areas  at  the  secondary  level.  In  Russia  vocational 
schools  traditionally  have  had  a  poor  image;  only  in  the  early 
1990s  was  comprehensive  vocational  education  introduced  for 
postsecondary  students.  In  1993  some  400  VUZ  offered  special- 
ized training  in  specific  vocational  areas  ranging  from  engi- 
neering and  electricity  to  agricultural  specialties.  Some 
vocational  schools  have  combined  general  and  vocational  cur- 
ricula, with  the  goal  of  giving  specialists  a  broader  educational 
background.  Another  trend  is  the  integration  of  higher  techni- 
cal education  with  on-the-job  training  by  linking  educational 
institutions  with  enterprises  and  factories. 

In  the  post-Soviet  era,  business  education  has  expanded  dra- 
matically because  the  demand  for  competent  managers  far  out- 
strips the  supply.  Experts  believe  that  Russia's  business 
education  programs  will  play  an  important  role  in  transform- 
ing social  attitudes  toward  the  market  economy  and  capitalism 
and  establishing  a  new  economic  infrastructure.  The  primary 
goal  of  the  new  programs  is  to  create  familiarity  with  the  princi- 
ples of  the  market  economy  while  casting  aside  Marxist  eco- 
nomic ideology.  In  the  first  two  years  after  the  Soviet  Union 
dissolved,  more  than  1,000  business  schools  and  training  cen- 
ters were  established. 

Three  types  of  institution  offer  business  management  educa- 
tion: state  and  private  business  schools  and  private  consulting 
firms.  Many  in  the  last  category  simply  offer  high-priced  lec- 


265 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

tures,  but  some  business  schools  have  developed  sophisticated 
programs.  Examples  are  the  International  Business  School  of 
Moscow  State  University,  the  Graduate  School  of  International 
Business  of  the  Academy  of  the  National  Economy  in  Moscow, 
and  the  International  Management  Institute  in  St.  Petersburg. 
Several  schools  offer  full  master  of  business  administration 
(MBA)  degree  programs  based  on  Western  models.  Business 
schools  are  funded  by  the  state  and  by  private  enterprise.  Com- 
petent faculty  are  at  a  premium  in  this  field;  many  have  been 
trained  by  Western  firms  such  as  IBM. 

Education  and  Society 

Education  plays  a  crucial  role  in  determining  social  status  in 
Russia.  People  who  leave  school  after  eight  years  generally  can 
find  only  unskilled  jobs.  Even  those  who  complete  secondary 
education  may  rise  no  higher  than  skilled  labor  or  low-level 
white-collar  work.  A  college  or  university  education  is  necessary 
for  most  professional  and  bureaucratic  positions  and  appears 
to  be  highly  desirable  for  a  position  of  political  power.  For 
example,  a  very  high  percentage  of  the  members  of  Russia's 
parliament  are  university  graduates. 

Access  to  higher  education  is  roughly  proportionate  to  the 
social  and  financial  situation  of  an  individual's  family.  Children 
whose  parents  have  money  and  status  usually  have  an  advan- 
tage in  gaining  admission  to  an  institution  of  higher  education. 
The  reasons  lie  not  only  with  the  parents'  possible  influence 
and  connections  but  increasingly  with  the  better  quality  of  pri- 
mary and  secondary  education  that  has  become  available  to 
such  children,  enhancing  their  ability  to  pass  difficult  univer- 
sity entrance  examinations.  Moreover,  such  families  can  afford 
to  hire  tutors  for  their  children  in  preparation  for  the  examina- 
tions and  can  more  readily  afford  to  pay  university  tuition  in 
case  the  children  do  not  receive  stipends. 

By  the  mid-1990s,  the  new  phenomenon  of  individual  com- 
mercial success  began  influencing  the  attitude  of  Russian  soci- 
ety toward  education  and  its  goals.  At  the  same  time,  the  last 
generation  of  Soviet-educated  Russians  was  finding  itself  ill  pre- 
pared to  deal  with  a  new  set  of  conditions  for  social  and  eco- 
nomic survival.  In  the  new  order,  acquisition  of  money  is  much 
more  important  for  both  self-respect  and  practical  survival,  and 
career  prestige  by  itself  is  of  relatively  less  worth  than  it  was  in 
the  Soviet  system,  where  every  career  label  ensured  a  known 
level  of  comfort.  Significantly,  in  post-Soviet  years,  the  phrase 


266 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


delat'  den'gi  (to  make  money)  has  passed  into  common  usage  in 
colloquial  Russian.  Together  with  the  employment  insecurity 
felt  in  the  1990s  by  well-educated  Russians,  the  new  values  have 
dampened  the  educational  ambitions  of  many,  particularly 
with  regard  to  higher  education.  Although  most  older  Russians 
resent  those  who  achieve  commercial  success  in  the  new  "sys- 
tem," the  generation  now  in  school  shows  increasing  interest  in 
advancement  in  the  private  sector  of  the  economy.  At  the  same 
time,  polls  show  that  education  ranks  ninth  among  the  most 
pressing  concerns  of  Russians. 

Health 

Russia  has  an  entrenched,  albeit  underfunded,  system  of 
socialized  medicine.  Basic  medical  care  is  available  to  most  of 
the  population  free  of  cost,  but  its  quality  is  extremely  low  by 
Western  standards,  and  in  the  mid-1990s  the  efficiency  of  the 
system  continued  the  decline  that  had  begun  before  the  col- 
lapse of  the  Soviet  system.  In  the  first  four  post-Soviet  years, 
that  decline  was  typified  by  significant  increases  in  infant  and 
maternal  mortality  and  contagious  diseases  and  by  decreases  in 
fertility  and  life  expectancy. 

Health  Conditions 

The  decline  in  health  is  attributable  in  part  to  such  environ- 
mental and  social  factors  as  air  and  water  pollution,  contamina- 
tion (largely  from  nuclear  accidents  or  improper  disposal  of 
radioactive  materials),  overcrowded  living  conditions,  inade- 
quate nutrition,  alcoholism,  and  smoking,  and  in  part  to  a  lack 
of  modern  medical  equipment  and  technology.  In  1991  life 
expectancy  in  Russia  was  74.3  years  for  females  and  63.5  years 
for  males.  By  1994  the  figure  for  males  was  57.3  years.  The 
male-to-female  ratio  in  the  population  reflects  the  higher  male 
mortality  rate  and  the  enduring  impact  of  losing  millions  more 
males  than  females  in  World  War  II.  (In  all  age-groups  below 
thirty-five,  there  are  more  males  than  females.)  In  1993  the 
overall  ratio  was  884  males  per  1,000  females,  and  experts  pre- 
dicted that  the  figure  for  males  would  decline  to  around  875  by 
the  year  2005  (see  Demographic  Conditions,  ch.  3). 

By  the  mid-1990s,  Russia's  death  rate  had  reached  its  highest 
peacetime  level  in  the  twentieth  century.  Curable  infectious 
diseases  such  as  diphtheria  and  measles  have  reached  epidemic 
levels  unseen  since  the  Bolshevik  Revolution,  and  the  rates  of 


267 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

tuberculosis,  cancer,  and  heart  disease  are  the  highest  of  any 
industrialized  country. 

In  1993  the  incidence  of  a  number  of  infectious  diseases 
increased  significantly  over  the  previous  year:  tuberculosis  by 
1.25  times,  brucellosis  by  1.9  times,  diphtheria  by  3.9  times, 
and  syphilis  by  2.6  times  (see  table  14,  Appendix).  In  1995  the 
Russian  health  system  was  overwhelmed  by  the  return  of  epi- 
demic diseases  such  as  cholera  and  typhoid  fever,  even  as  it 
faced  chronic  staff  and  equipment  shortages.  In  the  winter  of 
1995-96,  Russia  suffered  its  most  severe  epidemic  of  influenza 
in  decades.  An  estimated  1  million  people  were  infected  in 
Moscow  alone,  and  numerous  schools  and  public  institutions 
were  closed  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  disease.  Experts  attrib- 
uted the  virulence  of  the  epidemic  to  the  generally  low  level  of 
resistance  of  much  of  the  Russian  population,  the  result  of 
poor  overall  health  care  and  stressful  economic  conditions. 
Other  causes  were  the  uneven  availability  of  influenza  shots 
and  the  population's  general  belief  that  injections  enhance 
rather  than  decrease  an  individual's  chances  of  becoming  ill. 

Between  1980  and  1989,  cancer  and  its  complications 
increased  from  15  percent  to  18  percent  among  causes  of 
death.  In  1990  the  most  common  types  of  cancer  were  breast 
cancer,  cancer  of  the  stomach  and  liver,  and  skin  cancer.  In  the 
last  years  of  the  Soviet  Union,  about  680,000  new  cases  were 
diagnosed  annually.  The  causes  of  cancer  are  varied  and  com- 
plex, but  contributing  factors  in  Russia  are  heavy  smoking, 
radiation  exposure,  and  contact  with  pervasive  toxic  emissions 
and  chemicals  in  soil,  food,  and  water.  According  to  the  deputy 
minister  of  environmental  protection  and  natural  resources, 
about  50  percent  of  all  cancer-related  illnesses  can  be  attrib- 
uted to  environmental  factors.  Heavy-manufacturing  regions 
show  especially  high  rates;  in  Noril'sk,  the  metallurgical  center 
located  above  the  Arctic  Circle,  the  incidence  of  lung  cancer 
among  males  is  the  highest  in  the  world  (see  Environmental 
Conditions,  ch.  3). 

Russia's  birthrate  has  shown  an  increasingly  steep  decline  in 
the  1990s,  amounting  to  what  one  commentator  calls  "the 
quiet  suicide  of  a  nation."  For  example,  the  annual  birthrate 
for  the  first  six  months  of  1992  was  11.2  per  1,000  population — 
a  12  percent  decline  from  the  same  period  in  the  previous  year. 
In  some  areas,  the  rate  was  even  lower,  for  instance,  9.2  in  St. 
Petersburg  and  8.2  in  the  Moscow  region.

Russia's  Ministry  of  Health  reported  in  June  1991  that  the 
country  had  a  negative  rate  of  population  change  for  the  first 
time  since  records  have  been  kept.  The  declining  number  of 
births  is  attributed  in  part  to  a  drop  in  fertility,  which  presum- 
ably stems  from  a  combination  of  physiological  and  environ- 
mental factors,  and  in  part  to  women's  reluctance  to  bear 
children  in  a  time  of  economic  uncertainty. 

Maternity,  Infant  Care,  and  Birth  Control 

Some  of  the  same  factors  shortening  the  lives  of  adults  cause 
needless  premature  deaths  of  newborns  in  Russia.  Poor  overall 
health  care  and  lack  of  medicines,  especially  in  rural  areas, 
reduce  infants'  survival  chances.  In  Russia  an  estimated  40  to 
50  percent  of  infant  deaths  are  caused  by  respiratory  failure, 
infectious  and  parasitic  diseases,  accidents,  injuries,  and 


269 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

trauma.  For  developed  countries,  this  share  ranges  between  4 
and  17  percent. 

Infant  mortality  rates  vary  considerably  by  region.  Central 
and  northern  European  Russia's  rates  have  been  more  in  line 
with  West  European  rates.  In  the  intermediate  category  are  the 
Urals,  western  Siberia,  and  the  Volga  Basin.  The  highest  rates 
are  found  in  the  North  Caucasus,  eastern  Siberia,  and  the  Far 
East.  Several  autonomous  republics,  including  Kalmykia, 
Chechnya,  Ingushetia,  Dagestan,  and  Tyva,  consistently  record 
the  highest  rates  in  the  Russian  Federation.  In  these  areas, 
social  and  economic  underdevelopment,  poor  health  care,  and 
environmental  degradation  have  had  an  impact  on  the  health 
of  mothers  and  newborns. 

Unwanted  pregnancies  are  common  because  of  the  limited 
availability  and  substandard  quality  of  contraceptives  and  a 
reluctance  to  discuss  sexual  issues  openly  at  home  or  to  provide 
sex  education  at  school.  No  social  stigma  is  attached  to  chil- 
dren born  out  of  wedlock,  and  unmarried  mothers  receive 
maternity  benefits.  Medical  care  for  expectant  mothers  is 
among  the  least  adequate  aspects  of  the  country's  generally 
substandard  system  of  health  care.  A  high  percentage  of  preg- 
nant women  suffer  from  anemia  and  poor  diets — factors  that 
have  a  negative  effect  on  their  babies'  birth  weight  and  general 
health. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  modern  forms  of  contraception  are 
unavailable  or  unknown  to  most  Russian  women.  The  Soviet 
Union  legalized  abortion  for  medical  reasons  in  1955  and  over- 
all in  1968.  But  information  about  Western  advances  in  birth 
control — and  all  modern  means  of  birth  control — was  system- 
atically kept  from  the  public  throughout  the  remaining  Soviet 
decades.  As  a  result  of  that  policy,  today's  Russian  gynecologists 
lack  the  training  to  advise  women  on  contraception,  and  public 
knowledge  of  the  subject  remains  incomplete  or  simply  mis- 
taken. Even  in  Moscow  in  the  mid-1990s,  most  contraceptives 
were  paid  for  by  voluntary  funds  and  international  charities.  In 
the  early  1990s,  an  estimated  22  percent  of  women  of  child- 
bearing  age  were  using  contraceptives;  the  percentage  was 
much  lower  in  rural  areas. 

Abortion  remains  the  most  widely  practiced  form  of  birth 
control  in  Russia.  In  1995  some  225  abortions  were  performed 
for  every  100  live  births,  up  from  a  rate  of  196  per  100  in  1991. 
According  to  one  study,  14  percent  of  the  women  in  Russia  with 
sixteen  or  more  years  of  school  had  undergone  eight  to  ten 


270 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


abortions.  The  conditions  under  which  abortions  are  per- 
formed often  are  primitive.  Moreover,  it  is  estimated  that 
nearly  three-quarters  of  abortions  take  place  after  the  first  tri- 
mester of  pregnancy,  involving  substantially  greater  maternal 
risk  than  those  performed  earlier.  The  number  of  abortions  is 
much  higher  among  Russian  women  than  among  Muslims  and 
other  minority  groups,  however.  Statistically,  the  higher  her 
social  status  and  the  extent  of  her  Russification,  the  more  likely 
a  Muslim  woman  is  to  seek  an  abortion. 

Infant  and  child  health  in  Russia  is  significantly  worse  than 
in  other  industrialized  countries.  According  to  official  statistics, 
only  one  child  in  five  is  born  healthy.  The  inability  of  more 
than  half  of  all  new  mothers  to  breast-feed,  mainly  because  of 
poor  diet,  further  undermines  infants'  health  in  a  country 
where  diets  generally  are  unbalanced.  Another  problem  is  that 
most  women  of  childbearing  age  are  employed  and  thus  must 
place  their  young  children  in  day  care  centers,  where  they 
often  contract  contagious  diseases.  Illnesses  such  as  cholera, 
typhoid  fever,  diphtheria,  pertussis,  and  poliomyelitis,  which 
have  been  virtually  eradicated  in  other  advanced  industrial 
societies,  are  widespread  among  Russia's  children.  Vaccines  are 
scarce.  Even  when  immunizations  are  available,  parents  often 
refuse  them  for  their  children  because  they  fear  infection  from 
dirty  needles. 

Alcohol,  Narcotics,  and  Tobacco 

Russia's  rate  of  alcohol  consumption,  traditionally  among 
the  highest  in  the  world  and  rising  significantly  in  the  1990s,  is 
a  major  contributor  to  the  country's  health  crisis,  as  well  as  to 
low  job  productivity.  Rated  as  Russia's  third  most  critical  health 
problem  after  cardiovascular  diseases  and  cancer,  alcoholism 
has  reached  epidemic  proportions,  particularly  among  males. 
In  the  twentieth  century,  periodic  government  campaigns 
against  alcohol  consumption  have  resulted  in  thousands  of 
deaths  from  the  consumption  of  alcohol  surrogates.  The  latest 
such  campaign  was  undertaken  from  1985  to  1988,  during  the 
regime  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in  office  1985-91).  Although 
some  authorities  credited  reduced  alcohol  consumption  with  a 
concurrent  drop  in  Russia's  mortality  rate,  by  1987  the  produc- 
tion of  samogon  (home-brewed  liquor)  had  become  a  large- 
scale  industry  that  provided  alcohol  to  Russians  while  depriv- 
ing the  state  of  tax  revenue.  When  restrictions  were  eased  in 
1988,  alcohol  consumption  exceeded  the  pre-1985  level. 


271 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

According  to  one  study,  between  1987  and  1992  annual  per 
capita  consumption  rose  from  about  eleven  liters  of  pure  alco- 
hol to  fourteen  liters  in  1992;  current  consumption  is  esti- 
mated at  about  fifteen  liters.  (According  to  World  Health 
Organization  standards,  consumption  of  eight  liters  per  year  is 
likely  to  cause  major  medical  problems.) 

A  1995  Russian  study  found  that  regular  drunkenness 
affected  between  25  and  60  percent  of  blue-collar  workers  and 
21  percent  of  white-collar  workers,  with  the  highest  incidence 
found  in  rural  areas.  Because  alcohol  remains  cheap  relative  to 
food  and  other  items,  and  because  it  is  available  in  most  places 
day  and  night,  unemployed  people  are  especially  prone  to 
drunkenness  and  alcohol  poisoning.  In  1994  some  53,000  peo- 
ple died  of  alcohol  poisoning,  an  increase  of  about  36,000 
since  1991.  If  vodka  is  unavailable  or  unaffordable,  Russians 
sometimes  imbibe  various  combinations  of  dangerous  sub- 
stances. The  Russian  media  often  report  poisonings  that  result 
from  consumption  of  homemade  alcohol  substitutes.  Produc- 
tion of  often-substandard  alcohol  has  become  a  widespread 
criminal  activity  in  the  1990s,  further  endangering  consumers. 
Alcohol  consumption  among  pregnant  women  is  partly  respon- 
sible for  Russia's  rise  in  infant  mortality,  birth  defects,  and 
childhood  disease  and  abnormalities. 

Smoking,  a  widespread  habit,  especially  among  women  and 
teenagers,  compounds  Russia's  health  crisis.  Chain-smoking  is 
endemic  in  Russia;  in  1996  an  estimated  55  percent  of  Russians 
were  regular  smokers,  and  health  authorities  believed  that  the 
figure  was  rising.  However,  rather  than  urge  patients  to  quit, 
doctors  often  recommend  the  purchase  of  American  ciga- 
rettes, which  are  more  expensive  but  have  less  tar  and  nicotine 
than  Russian  brands.  When  import  restrictions  ended  in  the 
early  1990s,  the  American  cigarette  industry  found  a  large  new 
market  in  Russia.  A  modest  government  antismoking  campaign 
paralleling  Gorbachev's  anti-alcohol  campaign  in  the  late  1980s 
had  little  effect.  In  January  1996,  cigarette  advertising  in  the 
print  media  was  prohibited,  and  smoking  in  theaters  and  work- 
places generally  was  restricted  to  designated  locations. 

The  increasing  incidence  of  drug  abuse  was  belatedly 
acknowledged  by  the  Russian  government  as  a  public  health 
problem.  In  1995  an  estimated  2  million  Russians  used  narcot- 
ics, more  than  twenty  times  the  total  recorded  ten  years  earlier 
in  the  entire  Soviet  Union,  with  the  number  of  users  increasing 
50  percent  every  year  in  the  mid-1990s.  In  the  Soviet  era,  drugs

were  viewed  officially  as  a  capitalist  vice,  but  that  attitude  disap- 
peared soon  after  the  Soviet  Union  dissolved.  Russia  legalized 
drug  use  (but  not  possession  or  sale)  in  1991.  According  to 
experts,  laws  against  possession  are  not  dissuasive.  Narcotics 
use  has  spread  to  new  elements  of  society  in  recent  years, 
including  alcoholics  seeking  a  new  means  of  escape.  Russian 
experts  rate  the  new  class  of  Russian  businesspeople  as  the 
group  with  the  highest  percentage  of  drug  users;  for  them,  suc- 
cess often  includes  the  ability  to  purchase  the  most  expensive 
narcotic.  The  drug  scene,  once  dominated  by  students  and 
intellectuals,  now  includes  large  numbers  of  housewives  and 
workers.  Synthetic  drugs  now  are  manufactured  in  small  labo- 
ratories by  professional  chemists;  some  are  easily  fabricated  by 
amateurs  as  well.  Legally  produced  drugs  often  are  stolen  and 
move  into  the  black  market  (see  The  Crime  Wave  of  the  1990s, 
ch.  10). 

Medical  treatment  and  educational  programs  now  include 
hot  lines  in  major  cities  and  walk-in  clinics  that  provide  advice 
and  treatment  on  an  anonymous  basis.  Some  schoolteachers 
have  begun  class  discussions  of  drug-related  issues  and  have 
distributed  antidrug  literature  to  students.  Nevertheless,  Rus- 
sia's drug  problem  remains  largely  intractable.  Many  addicts 
overdose,  and  some  who  cannot  afford  heroin  inject  them- 
selves with  other  substances  that  cause  illness  or  death. 

Acquired  Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome 

Acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  likely  was 
brought  to  the  Soviet  Union  by  students  from  countries  with 
high  levels  of  incidence  of  the  disease.  In  1987,  after  the  first 
case  of  AIDS  was  confirmed  in  Russia,  the  Supreme  Soviet  of 
the  Soviet  Union  passed  the  strictest  anti-AIDS  law  in  the 
world,  making  the  knowing  transmittal  of  the  infection  a  crimi- 
nal offense  punishable  by  up  to  eight  years  in  jail.  A  1995  law, 
which  has  been  criticized  vehemently  for  its  human  rights 
implications  and  the  cost  of  its  administration,  stipulates  that 
all  visitors  remaining  more  than  three  months  must  prove  that 
they  are  not  infected  with  the  AIDS-causing  human  immunode- 
ficiency virus  (HIV). 

The  government  has  established  a  diagnostic  and  screening 
infrastructure  for  AIDS  prevention  and  control  at  the  central 
and  subnational  levels.  This  system  has  been  criticized  heavily, 
however,  because  it  tests  only  populations  with  little  chance  of 
infection,  and  because  it  fails  to  allocate  scarce  funds  to  root 


273

causes  of  AIDS  transmittal  such  as  infection  from  hospital  pro- 
cedures and  reuse  of  hypodermic  needles.  The  release  of  statis- 
tics on  the  incidence  of  AIDS  and  other  sexually  transmitted 
diseases  has  been  extremely  slow.  In  late  1995,  the  Ministry  of 
Health  reported  that  1,023  Russians,  including  278  children, 
had  been  registered  as  having  HIV,  and  that  to  that  point  160 
Russians,  of  whom  seventy-three  were  children,  had  died  of 
AIDS.  Before  1992  several  mass  infections  of  children  occurred 
in  medical  facilities. 

Official  diagnoses  of  HIV  increased  50  percent  from  1993  to 
1994.  However,  according  to  an  official  of  the  Imena  AIDS  sup- 
port group,  which  is  devoted  to  rehabilitation  of  HIV  victims, 
the  official  statistics  are  understated  at  least  tenfold  because 
Russians  in  the  groups  most  at  risk — prostitutes,  homosexuals, 
and  drug  users — have  reason  to  fear  that  results  will  not 
remain  confidential  and  so  refuse  AIDS  testing.  Although  the 
1990  Law  on  Prevention  of  AIDS  mandates  confidentiality  of 
medical  records,  in  practice  jobs  often  are  lost  and  social  ser- 
vices denied  after  a  positive  diagnosis.  The  highest  incidence  of 
HIV  is  in  Moscow,  St.  Petersburg,  Rostov-na-Donu,  Volgograd, 
and  the  Republic  of  Kalmykia,  the  last  three  of  which  have 
medical  facilities  where  unsanitary  procedures  have  resulted  in 
mass  transmission  of  the  virus.  The  majority  of  reported  HIV- 
positive  individuals  are  drug  users. 

As  in  the  Soviet  period,  the  public  receives  little  information 
about  precautions  against  AIDS  or  the  identity  of  the  high-risk 
categories  in  society,  and  AIDS  sufferers  meet  much  intoler- 
ance in  Russian  society.  Because  the  disease  has  been  associ- 
ated with  foreigners,  government  officials  and  the  public  have 
ignored  the  need  for  preventive  measures  among  Russians. 
AIDS  transmittal  is  increased  by  a  chronic  shortage  of  condoms 
(which  Soviet  medical  officials  euphemistically  called  "Article 
Number  2")  and  by  the  lack  of  disposable  hypodermic  syringes 
in  hospitals  and  clinics,  which  results  in  the  repeated  use  of 
unsterilized  needles. 

The  Health  System 

The  glasnost  period  of  the  late  1980s  first  revealed  the  decay 
of  the  Soviet  system  of  socialized  medicine,  which  nominally 
guaranteed  full  health  protection  to  all  citizens  without  charge. 
That  system  had  been  installed  under  Joseph  V.  Stalin  (in 
office  1927-53)  with  an  emphasis  on  preserving  a  healthy  work 
force  as  a  matter  of  national  economic  policy.  In  the  1980s,

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russia  had  a  huge  network  of  neighborhood  and  work-site  clin- 
ics and  first-aid  facilities  to  provide  readily  accessible  primary 
care,  together  with  large  hospitals  and  polyclinics  to  diagnose 
and  treat  more  complex  illnesses  and  to  perform  surgery.  In 
1986  the  Soviet  Union  had  23,500  hospitals  with  more  than  3.6 
million  beds.  Such  facilities  included  about  28,000  women's 
consultation  centers  and  pediatric  clinics,  together  with  emer- 
gency ambulance  services  and  sanatoriums. 

In  the  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  was  first  in  the  world  in  the 
ratio  of  hospital  beds  to  population.  Behind  this  system  was  a 
huge,  multilevel  bureaucracy  directed  from  Moscow  in  consul- 
tation with  organs  of  the  CPSU.  All  aspects  of  health  service 
had  nationwide  annual  programs  with  complex  statistical 
accounting  and  goals.  Physicians  devoted  an  estimated  50  per- 
cent of  their  time  to  filling  out  forms,  and  every  year  a  large 
part  of  the  national  health  care  budget  went  to  construction  of 
new  facilities. 

The  structure  of  the  Soviet  system,  which  specified  the 
length  of  treatment  for  every  disease,  often  caused  people  suf- 
fering from  relatively  minor  ailments  such  as  influenza  to  be 
hospitalized.  The  result  was  a  serious  overcrowding  problem  in 
hospitals  despite  the  large  number  of  beds  available.  Patients 
preferred  hospital  treatment  because  hospitals  were  better 
equipped  than  clinics  and  because  crowded  living  conditions 
made  recuperation  at  home  difficult.  Many  large  enterprises 
operated  clinics  that  provided  workers  health  care  without 
requiring  them  to  leave  the  work  site.  Such  clinics  aimed  at 
reducing  the  incidence  of  sick  leave,  which  averaged  3  percent 
of  the  workforce  per  day  in  the  1980s. 

The  most  outdated  and  abuse-ridden  aspect  of  Soviet  health 
care  was  psychiatric  treatment.  That  system  never  advanced 
from  the  methodology  of  the  1950s,  which  included  Pavlovian 
conditioned-response  treatment,  heavy  reliance  on  drug  ther- 
apy, and  little  practice  of  individual  or  group  counseling. 
Therefore,  most  citizens  preferred  to  suffer  rather  than  submit 
themselves  to  treatment.  In  addition,  Soviet  psychiatry  was  at 
the  service  of  the  government  to  declare  dissenters  "insane," 
commit  them  to  psychiatric  hospital-prisons,  and  administer 
powerful  psychotropic  drugs.  In  the  mid-1980s,  estimates  of 
the  number  of  political  prisoners  in  such  institutions  ranged 
from  1,000  to  several  thousand,  and  in  1983  the  Soviet  Union 
withdrew  from  the  World  Psychiatric  Association  to  avoid  cen- 
sure for  its  abuses  of  the  profession.  In  1988  the  special  psychi- 


276 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


atric  hospitals  to  which  political  dissidents  had  been 
committed  were  transferred  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Internal  Affairs  to  that  of  the  Ministry  of  Health. 

In  1986  the  Soviet  Union  had  about  1.2  million  doctors  and 
about  3.2  million  paramedical  and  nursing  personnel.  Medical 
training  emphasized  practical  work  over  basic  research  and 
pure  science;  only  nine  medical  institutes  were  attached  to  uni- 
versities. In  the  late  1980s,  the  average  doctor's  salary  was 
roughly  comparable  to  that  of  the  average  industrial  worker.  In 
1996  the  average  Moscow  specialist  made  about  US$75  per 
month,  and  senior  doctors  made  about  US$150  per  month. 
Paramedics  and  nurses  needed  only  two  years  of  training  and 
no  scientific  background;  however,  in  rural  areas,  which  suf- 
fered a  shortage  of  doctors,  such  individuals  often  were  the 
only  medical  personnel  available. 

Despite  the  nominally  equitable  nature  of  Soviet  socialized 
medicine,  the  actual  system  was  highly  stratified  according  to 
location,  with  far  inferior  care  and  facilities  available  in  rural 
areas,  and  especially  according  to  political  status.  The  Ministry 
of  Health  maintained  a  completely  separate,  vastly  superior  sys- 
tem of  clinics,  hospitals,  and  sanatoriums  for  top  party  and  gov- 
ernment officials  and  other  elite  groups  such  as  writers,  actors, 
musicians,  and  artists. 

The  outline  of  the  Soviet  system  did  not  change  appreciably 
in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  but  quality  declined  in  nearly 
every  aspect  except  the  facilities  designated  for  the  elite.  In 
1992  Russia  had  662,700  doctors,  a  drop  of  about  32,000  since 
1990,  and  131  hospital  beds  per  10,000  population,  a  drop  of 
97,000  beds  (about  5  percent)  since  1990.  Among  the  doctors, 
78,600  were  surgeons,  77,600  pediatricians,  39,600  gynecolo- 
gists, 20,300  psychiatrists,  and  18,500  neurologists. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  public  health  delivery  system  in  Rus- 
sia was  in  crisis.  Although  the  number  of  doctors  and  paramed- 
ics has  remained  sufficiently  high  to  ensure  the  provision  of 
adequate  treatment,  most  such  personnel  are  poorly  trained, 
lack  modern  equipment,  and  are  badly  paid.  In  1995  Russia 
had  one  doctor  for  every  275  citizens  (compared  with  one  for 
every  450  in  the  United  States),  but  about  half  of  medical 
school  graduates  cannot  diagnose  simple  ailments  or  read  an 
electrocardiogram  when  they  enter  practice.  In  1993  about 
forty  institutions  offered  medical  training,  but  the  quality  of 
training  varied  considerably.  Many  medical  schools  suffer  from 


277 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

shortages  of  instructors,  textbooks,  current  medical  journals, 
contacts  with  Western  experts,  and  equipment. 

Low  salaries  have  made  corruption  common  among  medical 
personnel,  who  often  extract  bribes  for  both  materials  and  ser- 
vices. Thus,  although  health  care  is  free  in  principle,  the 
chances  of  receiving  adequate  treatment  may  depend  on  the 
patient's  wealth.  The  combination  of  bribes  and  authorized 
charges  puts  many  types  of  medical  treatment  beyond  the 
reach  of  all  but  the  wealthy.  Elderly  people  are  hit  especially 
hard  by  this  situation.  Meanwhile,  a  sharp  decline  in  state  fund- 
ing has  affected  all  aspects  of  medical  care,  from  prevention  to 
emergency  treatment.  Between  1990  and  1994,  state  funding 
declined  from  3.4  percent  of  the  national  budget  to  1.8  per- 
cent. 

Although  Russia  pioneered  in  some  specialized  fields  of 
medicine  such  as  laser  eye  surgery  and  heart  surgery,  the  coun- 
try's medical  establishment  is  generally  deficient  in  hospital 
equipment,  technology,  and  pharmaceuticals.  For  example, 
preventable  infant  deaths  result  from  an  absence  of  fetal  heart 
monitors,  ultrasound  units,  and  various  other  equipment  for 
monitoring  labor  and  delivery;  needless  deaths  from  heart  dis- 
ease occur  because  hospitals  lack  the  equipment  needed  to 
perform  bypass  surgery  and  angioplasty. 

Facilities  for  the  disabled,  of  whom  about  6  million  reside  in 
Russia,  also  fall  far  below  Western  standards.  Wheelchairs  and 
artificial  limbs  are  in  very  short  supply,  rehabilitation  centers 
are  few,  and  wheelchair  ramps  are  virtually  nonexistent.  A  1995 
law,  On  the  Social  Protection  of  Disabled  Persons  in  the  Rus- 
sian Federation,  provides  for  a  wide  range  of  benefits  and  ser- 
vices, including  equal  access  to  education,  employment, 
transportation,  and  services.  The  law  requires  businesses  to  set 
aside  at  least  3  percent  of  their  jobs  for  the  disabled.  However, 
no  funding  was  available  for  any  of  the  law's  programs  in  1996. 

The  shortage  of  medicines  in  Russia  is  chronic  and  cata- 
strophic. Soviet-era  supplies  of  materials  and  drugs  have  been 
depleted  and  are  not  being  adequately  replenished.  Domestic 
production  has  plummeted  because  of  the  obsolescence  of 
pharmaceutical  factories  and  shortages  of  requisite  raw  materi- 
als and  supplies.  Many  of  the  items  produced  are  ineffective. 
Russia  relies  increasingly  on  imports  from  former  Soviet-bloc 
nations  in  Central  Europe,  which  formerly  accepted  barter 
transactions  and  payment  in  rubles  but  now  demand  hard  cur- 
rency (see  Glossary),  a  scarce  item  in  Russia,  for  their  products. 


278 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  nonconvertibility  of  the  ruble  also  has  hindered  Russia's 
ability  to  purchase  medicines  abroad.  Even  when  pharmaceuti- 
cals are  available  in  Russia,  they  often  are  priced  beyond  the 
reach  of  doctors  and  patients. 

Russia's  hospitals  and  polyclinics  are  generally  old  (about  15 
percent  were  built  before  1940),  and  they  lack  basic  amenities. 
Roughly  42  percent  of  the  country's  hospitals  and  30  percent 
of  its  clinics  lack  hot  water,  and  12  percent  and  7  percent, 
respectively,  have  no  running  water  at  all.  About  18  percent  of 
hospitals  and  15  percent  of  clinics  are  not  connected  to  a  sew- 
erage system,  and  only  12  percent  in  both  categories  have  cen- 
tral heating.  Even  in  the  best  hospitals,  medical  personnel  do 
not  regularly  wash  their  hands,  surgical  instruments  are  not 
always  properly  sterilized,  and  rates  of  infection  are  abnormally 
high. 

Aside  from  shortfalls  in  Russia's  health  facilities  and  the 
quality  of  medical  personnel,  much  of  the  country's  public 
health  crisis  stems  from  poor  personal  hygiene  and  diet  and 
lack  of  exercise.  Preventive  medicine  and  wellness  programs 
are  virtually  nonexistent,  as  are  programs  to  educate  the  public 
about  personal  sanitation,  proper  diet,  and  vitamins.  The  aver- 
age Russian  does  not  consume  a  balanced  diet.  Vegetables 
often  are  scarce  in  Russia,  except  in  rural  areas  where  they  are 
homegrown,  and  fruits  never  have  constituted  an  important 
element  of  the  Russian  diet.  Per  capita  meat  consumption  also 
has  fallen  in  the  1990s  (see  table  6,  Appendix). 

Russia's  government  is  attempting  to  equalize  the  distribu- 
tion of  health  care  by  fragmenting  the  Soviet-era  network  of 
top-level  medical  facilities  for  exclusive  use  of  the  elite.  In  the 
spring  of  1993,  President  Yeltsin  signed  a  decree  entitled  On 
Immediate  Measures  to  Provide  Health  Care  for  the  People  of 
the  Russian  Federation.  The  proclaimed  goal,  which  already 
had  been  established  in  the  1980s,  was  the  creation  by  2000  of  a 
"unified  system  of  health  care"  for  the  entire  population.  How- 
ever, economic  constraints  are  likely  to  stymie  achievement  of 
that  goal  in  the  near  future.  In  1995  less  than  1  percent  of  Rus- 
sia's budget  was  earmarked  for  public  health,  compared  with  6 
percent  in  Britain  and  more  than  12  percent  in  the  United 
States.  Experts  forecast  that  such  a  meager  outlay  will  not 
address  the  major  shortfalls  in  Russia's  health  care  system,  not 
to  mention  the  air,  water,  and  soil  pollution  that  continue  to 
contribute  insidiously  to  worsening  public  health. 


279 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  impersonality  and  inaccessibility  of  national  health  sys- 
tem facilities,  with  patients  often  standing  in  line  at  clinics  for 
an  entire  day  before  receiving  brief  diagnoses  and  prescrip- 
tions for  drugs  they  cannot  afford,  has  encouraged  many  Rus- 
sians to  turn  to  unorthodox  alternatives  such  as  faith  healing, 
herbal  medicine,  and  mysticism.  By  the  mid-1990s,  private 
medical  clinics  were  serving  a  growing  number  of  Russians  able 
to  afford  their  care. 

In  the  Soviet  era,  the  state  discouraged  alternative  medicine 
by  arresting  practitioners.  By  1995,  however,  the  number  of 
such  individuals  was  estimated  at  300,000,  and  as  many  as  80 
percent  of  Russians  needing  medical  assistance  have  turned  to 
them,  according  to  a  Yeltsin  adviser  on  social  policy.  Tradi- 
tional folk  healers  constitute  the  largest  group  of  nontradi- 
tional  practitioners.  They  offer  personalized  attention  and 
affordable  cures  such  as  birch  bark  and  cranberries  to  cure  a 
variety  of  complaints.  Russians  with  access  to  a  plot  of  land 
often  grow  their  own  herbs,  and  books  describing  home  cures 
have  become  popular.  Long-practiced  cures  such  as  wrapping 
oneself  in  a  vinegar-soaked  blanket  and  drinking  one's  own 
urine  have  become  more  widespread  in  the  1990s. 

Housing 

Always  in  short  supply  in  the  Soviet  era,  housing  continues 
to  be  at  a  premium  in  the  1990s.  However,  the  old,  state-con- 
trolled system  has  begun  giving  way  to  private  enterprise  and  a 
rudimentary  housing  market.  Despite  severe  inequalities  in 
housing  opportunity  and  daunting  financial  disadvantages, 
many  Russians  have  been  able  to  establish  private  homes  that 
would  have  been  beyond  their  reach  under  the  Soviet  system. 
Nevertheless,  in  1996  housing  subsidies  remained  a  significant 
drain  on  the  national  budget  as  the  state  continued  the 
attempt  to  protect  citizens  from  the  inequities  of  a  nascent 
housing  market. 

The  Soviet  Era 

In  the  Soviet  era,  all  land  and  most  buildings  belonged  to 
the  state;  in  rural  areas,  private  home  ownership  was  permit- 
ted, but  the  law  limited  such  houses  to  a  floor  space  of  forty 
square  meters.  The  occupants  of  state-owned  housing  enjoyed 
the  rights  to  lifetime  occupancy  and  to  bequeath  their  housing 
units  to  the  next  generation,  as  well  as  virtually  complete  pro- 


280 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


tection  against  eviction.  Rental  rates  remained  at  the  same 
extremely  low,  universal  level — 0.132  ruble  per  square  meter — 
from  1927  until  1992.  Maintenance  of  existing  buildings  and 
construction  of  new  housing  were  both  financed  from  other 
parts  of  the  state  budget;  only  3  percent  of  funds  used  for  these 
purposes  came  from  residents.  State  enterprises  covered  a  sig- 
nificant share  of  housing  expenses  as  part  of  their  employees' 
benefits.  The  design  and  construction  of  new  housing  had  no 
relation  to  aesthetics  or  even  to  cost;  in  cities  the  State  Con- 
struction Committee  (Gosstroy)  simply  erected  monolithic 
high-rise  buildings  containing  a  given  number  of  housing 
units,  following  the  dictates  of  the  five-year  plan  for  that  local- 
ity. In  1990  nearly  100  percent  of  the  housing  stock  in  Moscow 
and  St.  Petersburg  was  publicly  owned,  and  more  than  one- 
quarter  of  Russia's  total  housing  stock  had  been  built  before 
1917. 

As  in  other  aspects  of  daily  Soviet  life,  the  elite  were  allotted 
the  best  and  most  spacious  housing,  and  influential  friends 
helped  them  avoid  long  waiting  lists  that  sometimes  lasted 
more  than  ten  years  for  ordinary  Russians.  The  average  urban 
Russian  family  either  occupied  a  very  small  single  apartment  or 
shared  an  apartment  with  one  or  more  other  families,  with 
joint  access  to  the  bathroom  and  the  kitchen.  According  to  a 
1980  Soviet  estimate,  20  percent  of  urban  families  (and  53  per- 
cent in  Leningrad)  shared  apartments;  that  percentage  had 
dropped  slightly  by  the  end  of  the  Soviet  era.  Young,  unmar- 
ried Russians  often  found  housing  only  in  crowded  hostels 
operated  by  their  employer;  young  married  couples  frequently 
lived  with  one  set  of  parents  until  they  could  locate  an  apart- 
ment. Housing  in  rural  areas  was  more  spacious,  but  it  usually 
had  few  amenities — the  traditional  wooden  farmhouse  con- 
tained two  rooms  divided  by  a  raised  corridor,  with  living  space 
for  people  on  one  side  and  for  animals  on  the  other.  In  1990 
the  average  floor  area  per  person  in  Moscow  was  17.8  square 
meters,  and  in  Russia  as  a  whole  it  was  16.4  square  meters,  com- 
pared with  averages  in  Western  countries  of  between  thirty  and 
forty-five  square  meters  per  person. 

Post-Soviet  Conditions 

The  economic  reforms  of  the  post-Soviet  era  brought  drastic 
and  problematic  changes  in  the  Russian  housing  system.  In  the 
first  years  of  that  period,  state  support  for  new  construction 
dwindled  dramatically,  making  enterprises  a  more  important 


281

source  of  financing  in  the  absence  of  large-scale  private  invest- 
ment. Privatization  of  existing  housing  increased  substantially 
in  the  mid-1990s,  and  more  types  of  dwelling  became  eligible 
for  privatization.  The  rate  of  new  construction  did  not  keep 
pace  with  demand,  so  waiting  lists  continued  to  exist,  and  the 
beginning  of  landownership  law  reform  encouraged  construc- 
tion of  fully  private  housing  by  Russians  who  could  afford  it. 
However,  in  mid-1996  the  average  Russian  still  spent  less  than  3 
percent  of  his  or  her  budget  on  rent  because  a  large  share  of 
Soviet-era  state  housing  subsidies  remained  in  place. 

The  establishment  of  a  full  market  system  in  housing  was 
complicated  by  several  factors.  First,  the  notion  of  private  own- 
ership of  land  and  housing  was  diametrically  opposed  to  the 
concepts  at  the  base  of  Soviet  society,  so  the  advantages  of 
privatization  were  not  immediately  understood — especially  as 
low-rent  state  housing  continued  to  exist  alongside  expensive 
private  property.  Second,  high  inflation  priced  most  Russians 
out  of  the  housing  market,  especially  as  the  inflation-adjusted 
incomes  of  most  social  groups  declined.  Third,  continuing 
monopolies  in  construction  materials,  finance,  and  urbanized 
land  kept  construction  costs  very  high;  the  first  steps  toward 
privatization  were  taken  in  the  building  industry  only  in  1993. 
Finally,  a  relatively  high  percentage  of  existing  housing  stock 
remained  in  the  public  sector,  which  promised  to  remain  a  sig- 
nificant housing  owner  through  the  near  future. 

After  a  relatively  slow  beginning  in  1992,  privatization  of 
housing  stock  increased  dramatically.  The  Soviet  privatization 
law  of  1989  began  the  process,  which  was  continued  in  Russia 
by  the  1991  Law  on  Privatization  of  Housing.  But  the  newness 
of  the  laws,  the  lack  of  administrative  procedures,  and  the  con- 
tinuing attractiveness  of  low  rents  in  state-owned  housing  lim- 
ited the  total  number  of  units  privatized  in  1991  to  about 
122,000  units,  or  0.3  percent  of  urban  housing  stock  in  the  Rus- 
sian Republic.  By  the  end  of  1993,  more  than  40  percent  of 
urban  housing  stock  (about  8.6  million  units)  in  Russia  had 
been  privatized,  and  the  total  was  between  55  and  60  percent 
one  year  later.  Often  the  privatization  process  involved  renters 
buying  the  apartments  in  which  they  were  living.  An  important 
step  in  this  process  was  a  1992  constitutional  amendment  that 
allowed  free  distribution  of  housing,  broadened  the  categories 
of  housing  that  could  be  privatized,  and  simplified  privatiza- 
tion procedures.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  growing  problem  of 
how  to  house  military  families  formerly  domiciled  outside  Rus- 


282 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


sia  caused  the  Ministry  of  Defense  and  agencies  dependent 
upon  it  to  withhold  their  housing  stock  from  privatization;  in 

1993  defense  budgets  financed  15  percent  of  Russia's  total 
housing  investment. 

Availability  of  new  private  housing  improved  somewhat  by 
the  mid-1990s,  after  a  sharp  decline  in  the  first  post-Soviet 
years.  In  1993  the  output  of  new  housing  was  57  percent  of  the 
peak  Soviet-era  output  reached  in  1987,  and  in  the  early  1990s 
the  ratio  of  unfinished  projects  to  usable  housing  output  was 
more  than  three  to  one  (compared  with  84  percent  in  1988) 
because  incentives  promoted  new  starts  rather  than  comple- 
tions. Between  1986  and  1992,  the  number  of  names  on  hous- 
ing waiting  lists  increased  from  about  8  million  to  some  10 
million,  mainly  because  in  that  period  Russians  began  to 
change  jobs  and  places  of  residence  more  frequently  and 
because  family  units  became  smaller.  In  1993  more  than  21  per- 
cent of  urban  households  were  on  waiting  lists  for  housing. 
The  waiting  lists  began  to  shrink  in  1993,  and  by  the  end  of 

1994  about  9.1  million  Russian  households  (including  single- 
person  households)  were  registered  for  housing.  Inflation  also 
played  a  major  role  in  housing  availability;  in  1994  the  price  of 
a  typical  Moscow  apartment  of  fifty-five  square  meters 
increased  by  five  times  over  the  1993  average.  A  housing  allow- 
ance program  has  been  established  to  bridge  the  gap  between 
rental  costs  and  family  incomes. 

Because  they  felt  the  direct  pressure  of  longer  waiting  lists 
and  the  support  costs  associated  with  the  movement  of  people 
into  their  jurisdictions,  local  housing  authorities  lobbied 
against  abolition  of  the  internal  passport  (propiska;  see  Glos- 
sary) system  that  had  restrained  internal  migration  in  the 
Soviet  period.  In  1993  the  system  was  officially  abolished  in  all 
jurisdictions  except  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  (see  Social  Wel- 
fare, this  ch.). 

Housing  maintenance  has  been  problematic  in  the  post- 
Soviet  era  because  local  housing  authorities,  to  whom  full 
maintenance  responsibility  was  shifted  in  1991,  have  reallo- 
cated funds  from  maintenance  to  more  pressing  needs.  Mean- 
while, individual  attitudes  toward  routine  maintenance  have 
been  slow  to  compensate  for  this  shift.  In  Soviet-era  collective 
living  quarters  such  as  urban  high-rise  apartment  buildings, 
which  housed  as  many  as  1,000  people,  housing  managers  were 
expected  to  uphold  minimum  standards  of  cleanliness  and  ser- 
vice. In  the  1990s,  those  complexes  still  house  people  from  all 


283 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

economic  levels  (a  survival  of  Stalin-era  policy),  but,  given  the 
newly  fragmented  condition  of  Russian  society  and  economic 
distractions  facing  tenants,  initiatives  by  residents  often  give 
way  to  disregard  for  voluntary  maintenance  of  common  prop- 
erty. Housing  officials  demand  bribes  for  routine  services,  and 
housing  complexes  have  become  increasingly  shabby.  In  some 
cases,  the  suspicion  and  anonymity  of  the  Soviet  era  have  been 
reinforced  among  people  of  disparate  backgrounds  forced  to 
live  in  a  more  cramped  environment  than  in  Soviet  times.  How- 
ever, in  some  apartment  buildings  condominium  associations 
have  been  formed  to  advance  the  common  welfare  of  families 
in  a  building  or  neighborhood. 

Land  Reform  and  Private  Enterprise 

Experts  consider  reform  of  landownership  and  condomin- 
ium laws  an  important  step  toward  full  privatization  of  housing. 
Privatization  of  land,  both  urban  and  agricultural,  has  been  a 
controversial  issue  for  Russian  legislators;  there  is  a  strong  body 
of  opinion  that  land  is  fundamentally  public  property  that  can- 
not belong  to  any  single  person.  In  the  late  Soviet  period,  new 
landownership  laws  confused  rather  than  simplified  the  legal 
status  of  various  types  of  land.  Consequently,  housing  privatiza- 
tion has  been  hindered  because  ownership  of  a  residence  may 
not  include  ownership  of  the  land  on  which  it  stands — a  dispar- 
ity rare  in  Western  property  law.  Legislation  passed  in  August 
1993  legalized  the  sale  of  land,  allowed  villages  to  give  away 
plots  of  land  to  individuals,  and  removed  the  space  limitation 
on  private  homes  on  collective  farms.  Although  dwellings  built 
on  suburban  garden  plots  technically  still  could  be  no  bigger 
than  a  summer  cottage,  such  land  increasingly  was  used  to 
build  year-round  housing,  thus  expanding  the  number  of  avail- 
able residences  in  Moscow  and  other  cities. 

In  general,  Moscow  was  the  center  of  land-use  innovation 
because  it  was  the  center  of  new  commercial  activity  and  for- 
eign influence.  The  constitution  of  1993  recognized  for  the 
first  time  the  right  to  private  ownership  of  land,  a  departure 
that  experts  believed  would  have  a  major  impact  on  overall  real 
estate  ownership.  In  late  1993,  a  presidential  decree  estab- 
lished Russia's  first  set  of  provisional  condominium  regula- 
tions, which  were  considered  an  important  clarification  of 
housing  ownership  policy.  But  additional  legislation,  drafted  by 
the  Yeltsin  administration  to  expedite  landownership,  was 
blocked  in  the  State  Duma  in  1996. 


284 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Especially  in  Moscow,  the  emergence  of  Western-style  enter- 
prises associated  with  housing  construction,  such  as  finance 
companies,  real  estate  offices,  plumbing  suppliers,  and  lumber- 
yards, heralds  more  growth.  The  rapidly  rising  cost  of  existing 
apartments  has  fueled  a  brisk  property  business,  as  speculators 
buy  privatized  property  in  the  hope  that  prices  will  continue  to 
rise.  In  the  mid-1990s,  private  houses  began  to  appear  rapidly 
just  outside  the  ring  of  Soviet-era  high-rises  that  surrounds 
Moscow.  According  to  a  1995  report,  prices  for  private  land 
and  housing  in  Moscow  ranged  from  US$900  for  an  unim- 
proved small  plot  to  US$300,000  for  a  four-bedroom  villa  in  a 
compound  with  security  guards.  As  of  mid-1996,  mortgage 
loans  were  not  yet  offered  by  the  Russian  banking  system,  so 
buyers  had  to  pay  cash.  Many  Russians  build  their  own  dwell- 
ings, bribing  city  officials  and  contractors  when  necessary  and 
collecting  materials  wherever  possible.  The  demand  for  materi- 
als has  prompted  the  emergence  of  numerous  building  supply 
stores  and  a  parallel  rise  in  the  price  of  materials.  Thus, 
although  many  Russians  remain  on  waiting  lists  for  existing 
housing,  others  have  begun  what  they  hope  will  be  a  Western- 
style  progression  from  a  first  modest  dwelling  to  something 
larger.  The  same  divergence  has  appeared  in  housing  as  in 
other  aspects  of  socioeconomic  activity:  individuals  with  finan- 
cial resources  or  unusual  initiative  have  taken  advantage  of  the 
new  opportunities  of  the  1990s.  Those  not  so  fortunate  remain 
dependent  on  state  housing  subsidies. 

Social  Welfare 

As  Russia  makes  the  transition  from  a  command  economy  to 
a  partial  free-market  system,  the  provision  of  an  effective  social 
safety  net  for  its  citizens  assumes  increasing  urgency.  A  1994 
World  Bank  report  described  the  current  social-protection  sys- 
tem as  inappropriate  for  the  market-oriented  economy  toward 
which  Russia  supposedly  was  striving.  Among  the  major  short- 
comings noted  in  the  report  were  the  continued  major  role 
played  by  enterprises  as  suppliers  of  welfare  services,  as  they 
had  been  in  the  Soviet  period;  the  absence  of  any  coverage  for 
large  groups  of  people  and  the  inadequate  level  of  benefits  in 
some  regions;  a  growing  disparity  between  a  shrinking  wage 
base  and  the  demands  placed  on  the  system;  and  the  failure  to 
target  the  neediest  recipients.  As  the  economic  transition  of 
the  1990s  forces  more  of  Russia's  citizens  into  poverty,  the  state 


285 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

has  tried  to  maintain  the  comprehensive  Soviet  system  with 
severely  constrained  resources. 

The  system's  inefficiency  is  exacerbated  by  its  fragmentation. 
As  in  the  Soviet  period,  allowances  and  benefits  are  adminis- 
tered and  financed  by  diverse  agencies,  including  four 
extrabudgetary  funds,  several  ministries,  and  the  lower  levels  of 
government.  The  Ministry  of  Social  Protection  is  the  primary 
federal  agency  handling  welfare  programs.  However,  that  min- 
istry focuses  almost  exclusively  on  the  needs  of  people  who  are 
retired  or  disabled;  other  vulnerable  groups  receive  much  less 
attention.  The  four  extrabudgetary  funds  that  provide  cash 
and  in-kind  social  welfare  benefits  at  the  federal  level  are  the 
Social  Insurance  Fund,  the  Pension  Fund,  the  Employment 
Fund,  and  the  Fund  for  Social  Support. 

Social  security  and  welfare  programs  provide  modest  sup- 
port for  the  most  vulnerable  segments  of  Russia's  population: 
elderly  pensioners,  veterans,  infants  and  children,  expectant 
mothers,  families  with  more  than  one  child,  invalids,  and  peo- 
ple with  disabilities.  These  programs  are  inadequate,  however, 
and  a  growing  proportion  of  Russia's  population  lives  on  the 
threshold  of  poverty.  Inflation  has  a  particularly  deleterious 
effect  on  households  that  rely  on  social  subsidies.  Women  tradi- 
tionally have  outnumbered  men  in  such  households. 

The  Fund  for  Social  Support  supplements  a  variety  of  in- 
kind  social  assistance  programs  in  Russia.  It  is  financed 
through  the  Ministry  of  Social  Protection  and  supplements 
social  welfare  programs  at  the  subnational  level.  The  federal 
government  has  transferred  most  responsibility  for  social  wel- 
fare, health,  and  education  programs  to  subnational  organs 
but  has  failed  to  ensure  their  access  to  adequate  revenue.  The 
total  allocation  of  transfers  from  the  federal  budget  to  localities 
amounted  to  less  than  2  percent  of  Russia's  gross  domestic 
product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  in  1992.  Thus,  the  quantity  and 
quality  of  social  services  at  the  local  level — including  the  provi- 
sion of  food  vouchers  and  cash  payments  to  cover  specific 
items  such  as  heating  bills — are  far  from  certain  as  time  passes. 
Under  these  conditions,  local  jurisdictions  have  come  to  rely 
increasingly  on  extrabudgetary  sources,  the  instability  of  which 
makes  long-term  planning  difficult. 

Pensions 

Pensions  are  the  largest  expenditure  of  the  social  safety  pro- 
gram. The  Pension  Fund  accounts  for  83  percent  of  Russia's 


286 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


extrabudgetary  allocations.  At  the  end  of  1994,  about  36  mil- 
lion citizens,  or  24  percent  of  the  country's  population,  were 
receiving  pensions,  an  increase  of  about  5  percent  in  the  first 
three  post-Soviet  years.  Two  broad  categories  of  pensions  are 
paid  in  Russia:  labor  pensions,  which  are  disbursed  on  the  basis 
of  a  worker's  payroll  contributions,  and  social  pensions,  which 
are  paid  to  individuals  who  have  worked  for  less  than  the  five 
years  needed  to  qualify  for  a  labor  pension.  All  Russian  citizens 
who  have  worked  for  twenty  years  are  entitled  to  at  least  a  mini- 
mum pension.  In  1994  about  75  percent  of  all  pensioners 
received  labor  pensions.  The  Pension  Fund  also  finances  some 
child  allowances  and  other  entitlements. 

The  Pension  Fund  is  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Social 
Protection  and  financed  by  a  29  percent  payroll  tax  and  by 
transfers  from  the  state  budget.  Between  1991  and  1993,  the 
real  income  of  pensioners  was  cut  in  half  as  prices  rose  rapidly 
and  pension  indexation  failed  to  keep  pace.  Inflation  also 
severely  eroded  the  value  of  the  life  savings  of  retirees,  and  a 
disproportionate  number  of  pensioners  were  victimized  by 
financial  scams.  A  1994  law  requires  quarterly  indexation  of 
pensions,  but  the  law  was  not  observed  consistently  in  its  first 
year,  and  in  mid-1995  the  average  pension  fell  below  the  subsis- 
tence minimum  for  pensioners.  Beginning  in  1994,  the  govern- 
ment's failure  to  pay  pensions  on  time  led  to  large  rallies  in 
several  cities.  In  August  1994,  an  estimated  10  million  pension- 
ers did  not  receive  their  checks  on  time,  and  pension  arrears 
mounted  in  the  two  years  that  followed.  By  mid-1996  the  pay- 
ment backlog  was  estimated  at  US$3  billion.  The  present  sys- 
tem includes  an  important  provision  that  has  kept  many 
pensioners  above  the  poverty  line:  it  allows  workers  to  draw 
pensions  while  continuing  to  work.  In  1995  as  many  as  27  per- 
cent of  Russian  pensioners  continued  to  work  after  retiring 
from  their  primary  job. 

Russian  and  Western  experts  agree  that  the  pension  system 
requires  comprehensive  reform — although  its  rate  of  payment 
compliance  by  enterprises  is  substantially  better  than  that  of 
the  State  Taxation  Service.  The  most  pressing  needs  are  an 
effective  system  of  indexation  of  pensions  to  purchasing  power, 
an  insurance  mechanism,  individualized  contributions,  higher 
retirement  ages,  and  the  closing  of  loopholes  that  allow  early 
retirement.  In  1995  the  Ministry  of  Social  Protection  began 
work  on  a  reform  that  would  establish  a  three-tier  pension  sys- 
tem including  a  basic  pension,  a  work-related  pension  in  pro- 


287 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

portion  to  years  of  service,  and  an  optional  private  pension 
program.  In  1995  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Chernomyrdin  admit- 
ted that  the  state  budget  lacked  the  money  to  continue  index- 
ing pensions  according  to  living  costs.  In  November  1995,  a 
decree  by  President  Yeltsin,  On  Additional  Measures  to 
Strengthen  Payments  Discipline  for  Settling  Accounts  with  the 
Pension  Fund,  set  stricter  reporting  standards  for  payments  to 
the  fund  by  organizations  and  citizens,  in  an  effort  to  preclude 
nonpayment.  In  the  midst  of  his  campaign  to  be  reelected  pres- 
ident, Yeltsin  then  approved  two  laws  increasing  minimum  pen- 
sion levels  in  three  stages,  by  5,  10,  and  15  percent,  between 
November  1995  and  January  1996. 

Women  are  entitled  to  retire  when  they  reach  age  fifty-five, 
and  men  when  they  reach  age  sixty.  Nevertheless,  financial 
hardship  leads  many  women  to  remain  in  the  labor  force  past 
retirement  age,  even  while  continuing  to  receive  pensions,  in 
order  to  prevent  a  drop  in  their  families'  standard  of  living.  In 
1991  women  constituted  an  estimated  72  percent  of  pension- 
ers. The  disproportion  between  the  genders  stems  from 
women's  earlier  permissible  retirement  age  and  their  greater 
longevity.  Aside  from  pensions,  women  receive  other  retire- 
ment privileges.  Mothers  of  five  or  more  children  are  entitled 
to  a  pension  at  age  fifty.  "Mother  Heroines" — women  with  ten 
or  more  children — receive  an  allowance  equal  in  sum  to  the 
pension,  and  the  time  they  spent  on  child  care  leave  counts 
toward  the  minimum  twenty  years  of  work  required  for  labor 
pensions.  For  these  reasons,  many  women  retire  before  age 
fifty-five,  while  most  men  wait  until  they  reach  sixty-two.  (Many 
job  categories  routinely  allow  retirement  for  both  sexes  before 
the  standard  ages.) 

Worker  Protection  and  Benefits 

Legislation  has  established  numerous  protective  devices  at 
the  enterprise  level  to  provide  a  social  safety  net  that  is  particu- 
larly attuned  to  the  needs  of  women  of  childbearing  age.  Thus, 
family  policy  and  employment  policy  are  inextricably  linked.  In 
addition  to  basic  allowances  for  all  workers,  special  allowances 
exist  for  children  of  military  personnel,  children  with  unmar- 
ried, divorced,  or  widowed  mothers,  and  children  who  are  dis- 
abled. Women  who  have  an  employment  contract  are  entitled 
to  paid  maternity  leave  from  seventy  days  prior  to  giving  birth 
until  seventy  days  afterward.  Maternity  leave  benefits  are  based 


288 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


on  the  minimum  wage  rather  than  on  a  woman's  current  wage, 
however. 

Russia  also  provides  a  maternity  grant,  which  is  a  onetime 
payment  totaling  three  times  the  minimum  wage  or  45  percent 
of  the  minimum  wage  in  the  case  of  mothers  who  have  worked 
less  than  one  year.  In  order  to  receive  a  maternity  allowance 
(or  sickness  benefits),  a  woman  must  have  an  employment  con- 
tract. The  maternity  allowance  amounts  to  100  percent  of  the 
mother's  salary,  regardless  of  her  length  of  employment. 

Maternity  allowances  in  Russia  are  followed  by  a  monthly 
child  allowance  of  80  percent  of  the  minimum  wage  in  the  case 
of  children  up  to  eighteen  months  old.  This  allowance  may  be 
supplemented  by  a  child-care  allowance,  set  at  35  percent  of 
the  minimum  wage,  to  compensate  for  earnings  lost  in  the 
course  of  caring  for  children  in  this  age  bracket.  The  latter 
allowance  is  paid  to  mothers  over  the  age  of  eighteen  who  have 
been  in  the  labor  force  at  least  one  year.  An  additional  com- 
pensatory child-care  allowance,  equivalent  to  35  percent  of  the 
minimum  wage,  is  available  to  mothers  or  other  caretakers  of 
children  under  the  age  of  three. 

Russia  also  has  an  extended  child  allowance  of  45  percent  of 
the  minimum  wage  (60  percent  for  children  of  military  person- 
nel, children  living  with  a  guardian  or  in  an  orphanage,  and 
children  with  AIDS)  to  assist  families  with  the  care  of  children 
between  the  ages  of  eighteen  months  and  six  years.  Single 
mothers  and  those  who  receive  no  child  support  from  the 
father  of  their  child  may  obtain  an  additional  45  percent  of  the 
minimum  wage  up  to  their  child's  sixth  birthday;  this  figure  is 
then  increased  to  50  percent  and  remains  effective  until  the 
child  is  sixteen.  In  May  1992,  special  cost-of-living  compensa- 
tions were  introduced  to  cover  the  increased  expense  of  meet- 
ing children's  basic  needs.  These  compensations  ranged  from 
30  percent  of  the  minimum  wage  in  the  case  of  children  less 
than  six  years  old  to  40  percent  in  the  case  of  those  ages  thir- 
teen to  sixteen. 

Among  other  benefits  provided  by  enterprises  to  their  work- 
ers are  access  to  special  shops  that  sell  subsidized  milk  for  fami- 
lies with  low  incomes  and  small  children  and  an  allowance  to 
children  for  the  purchase  of  a  school  uniform  when  they  start 
school  and  again  at  the  age  of  thirteen.  Other  regulations  focus 
more  specifically  on  families  with  small  children.  These  include 
protective  legislation  prohibiting  the  dismissal  of  pregnant 
women  or  women  with  children  under  the  age  of  three,  ban-

ning  night  work  and  overtime  for  mothers  of  small  children, 
stipulating  workload  concessions  to  pregnant  women  and 
mothers  of  young  children,  and  providing  flextime,  part-time 
work,  home-based  employment,  nursing  intervals,  and  addi- 
tional paid  and  unpaid  leave  to  mothers  to  care  for  sick  chil- 
dren. Many  workplaces  also  permit  informal  leave  arrange- 
ments for  the  purpose  of  food  shopping. 

A  significant  portion  of  Russian  workers  have  entitlements  to 
housing,  child  care,  and  paid  vacations,  regardless  of  their  rank 
within  an  enterprise.  Housing  entitlements  involve  either  out- 
right provision  of  a  low-rent  apartment  (most  apartment  rents 
are  very  low)  or  various  forms  of  cash  or  in-kind  assistance. 
Moreover,  occupants  obtain  an  implicit  ownership  right 
extending  beyond  their  term  of  employment.  They  may  also 
have  the  legal  title  of  the  apartment  transferred  to  their  own 
names  without  paying  any  purchase  price  (see  Housing,  this 
ch.). 

Besides  housing  allowances,  most  large  and  medium-sized 
enterprises  provide  on-site  medical  facilities  or  they  contract 
for  outside  health  care  facilities  for  their  employees.  The  medi- 
cal care  provided  through  the  auspices  of  enterprises  is  free 
and  often  is  of  much  higher  quality  than  the  care  available  in 
government-run  facilities  (see  The  Health  System,  this  ch.). 
Finally,  enterprises  provide  their  employees  with  goods  ranging 
from  foodstuffs  to  consumer  durables.  The  enterprises  procure 
these  items  through  direct  purchase,  barter,  or  from  their  own 
farms,  and  make  them  available  at  below-market  prices. 

The  Social  Insurance  Fund  is  the  administrative  mechanism 
for  payments  to  workers  of  birth,  maternity,  and  sickness  allow- 
ances, and  child  allowances  for  children  between  the  ages  of 
six  and  sixteen.  The  fund  is  managed  by  the  largest  union 
organization  in  Russia,  the  Federation  of  Independent  Trade 
Unions  of  Russia  (Federatsiya  nezavisimykh  profsoyuzov 
Rossii — FNPR)  and  serves  as  the  repository  of  enterprise  con- 
tributions consisting  of  5.4  percent  of  the  total  payroll  (see 
Social  Organizations,  this  ch.).  Nominally  an  independent 
institution  since  its  establishment  in  1991,  the  Social  Insurance 
Fund  is  in  fact  responsible  to  the  FNPR. 

In  1993  an  overhaul  of  the  fund's  administrative  structure 
began  as  a  result  of  enterprises'  low  levels  of  compliance  with 
contribution  requirements,  charges  of  serious  abuse  by  trade 
union  officials,  and  the  government's  desire  to  promote  demo- 
cratic accountability.  Since  1993  the  management  system  has 


290

been  in  flux,  and  the  quality  of  administration  varies  consider- 
ably throughout  the  country.  Most  worker  contributions  to  the 
fund  are  retained  by  the  enterprise  for  distribution.  About  one- 
half  of  the  money  goes  to  sick  pay  and  one-fifth  to  subsidize 
treatment  at  sanatoriums.  Family  support  includes  birth  and 
maternal  allowances  intended  to  replace  lost  wages,  but  child 
allowances  do  not  address  poverty  directly  because  payments 
are  not  in  proportion  to  household  income. 

Russia  also  has  an  overall  system  of  family  benefits.  These 
can  be  grouped  into  three  broad  categories:  those  payable  to 
all  families  with  children,  regardless  of  income  or  other  qualify- 
ing conditions;  those  payable  to  working  mothers;  and  those 
payable  to  disadvantaged  families. 

The  communist  system,  for  all  its  economic  and  moral  defor- 
mities, provided  virtually  universal  employment,  so  that  every 
able-bodied  citizen  had  an  opportunity  to  earn  income  and 
thus  social  security.  In  postcommunist  Russia,  the  phenome- 
non of  unemployment  is  openly  acknowledged  and  growing 
(see  Unemployment,  ch.  6).  At  the  end  of  1995,  some  8.2  mil- 
lion people  were  registered  as  unemployed,  indicating  a  far 
higher  actual  number.  Three  years  earlier,  about  5  million  were 


291 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

registered.  The  "new  poor,"  in  the  parlance  of  the  World  Bank, 
put  a  considerable  strain  on  the  resources  available  in  Russia 
for  social  welfare. 

Administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  the  Employment 
Fund,  which  is  financed  by  a  2  percent  payroll  tax  from  all 
enterprises,  disburses  compensation  to  jobless  people.  The 
level  of  compensation,  already  low  in  1995,  was  expected  to 
drop  further  if  unemployment  rose.  As  part  of  its  assistance 
package  to  Russia,  the  World  Bank  is  providing  a  computerized 
system  that  will  help  the  country  register  claimants  for  unem- 
ployment and  pay  adequate  benefits. 

The  Ministry  of  Labor's  subsistence  minimum  is  based  on 
the  cost  of  nineteen  staple  items  considered  sufficient  to 
ensure  survival,  plus  an  estimated  minimum  cost  for  utilities, 
transportation,  and  other  necessities.  The  calculation  varies 
according  to  age-group  and  region;  trade  unions  use  other  for- 
mulas that  usually  expand  the  number  of  people  identified  as 
living  below  the  poverty  line.  In  early  1996,  the  State  Duma 
considered  a  law  that  would  make  the  Ministry  of  Labor's  fig- 
ure the  legal  basis  for  establishing  minimum  wages,  pensions, 
and  other  levels  of  social  support.  Barring  such  legislation,  the 
subsistence  minimum  has  no  legal  status. 

The  Homeless 

The  urban  homeless  are  a  category  of  the  socially  disadvan- 
taged that  received  no  official  recognition  in  the  Soviet  era. 
Because  Soviet  law  banned  beggars  and  vagrants,  the  homeless 
(meaning  anyone  who  lost  his  or  her  place  of  residence  for  any 
reason)  were  imprisoned  or  expelled  from  the  cities.  When  the 
ban  ended  in  the  early  1990s,  thousands  of  homeless  people, 
mostly  men,  appeared  in  Russia's  cities;  the  majority  had 
migrated  to  urban  areas  seeking  work  or  were  refugees  from 
the  armed  conflicts  that  erupted  in  the  Caucasus  and  Central 
Asia  when  the  Soviet  Union  dissolved. 

In  1995  Moscow  authorities  estimated  that  city's  homeless 
population  at  30,000,  but  Western  experts  put  the  figure  as 
high  as  300,000.  An  estimated  300  homeless  people  died  in 
Moscow  in  the  first  half  of  the  winter  of  1995-96,  and  on-site 
medical  personnel  reported  widespread  disease.  At  that  point, 
Moscow  had  one  shelter,  with  a  capacity  of  twenty-four,  and 
other  Russian  cities  offered  no  sanitation  or  temporary  resi- 
dence centers  of  any  sort.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  government  of 
mayor  Yuriy  Luzhkov  followed  the  Soviet  pattern  of  forcibly 


292 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


removing  vagrants  from  the  city,  especially  at  times  when  large 
numbers  of  Western  visitors  were  expected.  Police  routinely 
harass  and  beat  vagrants  found  on  the  streets.  The  Soviet  pro- 
piska  system  of  residency  permits,  which  granted  housing  and 
employment  to  individuals  only  in  the  place  where  they  were 
officially  registered,  has  been  found  unconstitutional  several 
times  by  Russia's  Constitutional  Court.  However,  many  local 
authorities,  including  those  in  Russia's  largest  European  cities, 
continue  to  require  Soviet-era  documentation;  in  1995  Moscow 
assessed  a  fee  of  35  million  rubles  (about  US$7,000)  for  regis- 
tration as  a  permanent  resident  of  the  city,  and  several  other 
cities  adopted  similar  measures.  In  the  face  of  such  restrictions, 
many  homeless  individuals  are  unable  to  change  their  status. 

Through  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  no  specific  agency  of  the 
Russian  government  has  borne  responsibility  for  aiding  the 
homeless;  the  Federal  Migration  Service,  a  badly  underfunded 
and  understaffed  agency  created  in  1992,  has  not  been  able  to 
carry  out  its  legal  responsibility  to  locate  housing  and  employ- 
ment for  internal  and  external  migrants  (see  Migration,  ch.  3). 
A  number  of  Western  humanitarian  organizations,  such  as  the 
Salvation  Army  and  Doctors  Without  Borders,  are  the  main 
source  of  assistance.  In  late  1995,  the  many  deaths  of  homeless 
people  prompted  the  Moscow  government  to  announce  plans 
to  build  ten  new  shelters  and  to  ease  the  procedure  for  obtain- 
ing residency  permits. 

Private  charities  in  Russia  have  suffered  from  an  absence  of 
government  support  and  a  general  lack  of  social  acceptance.  In 
1995,  for  example,  the  soup  kitchen  of  the  Christian  Mercy 
Society  in  Moscow,  which  fed  400  poor  people  daily,  had  to  pay 
city  officials  to  stay  open,  and  the  organization  was  unable  to 
obtain  a  designated  space  in  which  to  operate.  In  fact,  Russian 
law  gives  no  status  whatever  to  private  charities,  so  such  organi- 
zations must  fend  for  themselves  in  helping  the  increasingly 
large  number  of  urban  poor.  Russian  society  generally  distrusts 
charities,  partly  because  no  such  institutions  existed  either  in 
tsarist  times  (royalty  and  the  nobility  provided  whatever  assis- 
tance went  to  the  needy)  or  in  the  Soviet  era,  and  partly 
because  society  has  become  fragmented  by  the  difficult  eco- 
nomic conditions  of  the  1990s. 

According  to  Western  experts,  a  comprehensive  system  of 
social  protection  is  an  urgent  need  of  the  Russian  government, 
both  for  humanitarian  reasons  and  as  a  prerequisite  to  finan- 
cial stabilization  and  economic  restructuring.  The  quality  of 


293 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


future  Russian  society  also  will  depend  on  reversing  a  steep 
downward  trend  in  the  quality  of  education  and  health  care 
that  has  eroded  the  ability  of  Russians  to  improve  their  eco- 
nomic standing  and  to  feel  the  sense  of  basic  security  that  the 
Soviet  system  provided  to  some  degree.  Under  Russia's  condi- 
tions of  drastic  social  and  economic  change,  such  forms  of  sup- 
port are  especially  missed  in  the  mid-1990s.

A  number  of  useful  monographs  published  in  the  1990s 
include  discussion  of  various  aspects  of  Russia's  social  condi- 
tions. In  Redefining  Russian  Society  and  Polity,  Mary  Buckley  dis- 
cusses major  changes  in  housing,  health  care,  and  social 
expectations,  with  substantial  background  on  the  Soviet 
period.  The  Environmental  and  Health  Atlas  of  Russia,  edited  by 
Murray  Feshbach,  provides  useful  details  on  the  health  crisis 
and  its  causes.  Education  and  Society  in  the  New  Russia,  edited  by 
Anthony  Jones,  includes  discussion  of  education  trends  as  they 
apply  to  changes  in  post-Soviet  society.  Local  Power  and  Post- 
Soviet  Politics,  edited  by  Theodore  Friedgut  and  Jeffrey  Hahn, 
illuminates  the  role  of  local  governments  in  areas  such  as  wel- 
fare and  housing.  The  World  Bank's  1995  report  Russia,  Hous- 
ing Reform  and  Privatization  gives  a  full  picture  of  the  economic 
forces  and  existing  traditions  at  work  in  forming  a  new  housing 
market.  Igor  Ron's  The  Sexual  Revolution  in  Russia  is  a  detailed 
and  well-documented  analysis  of  sexual  attitudes  in  the  Soviet 
and  post-Soviet  periods.  Russia's  Youth  and  Its  Cultureby  Hilary 
Pilkington  is  a  sociological  study  of  groupings  and  behavior.  A 
series  of  articles  by  Penny  Morvant,  published  in  the  Open 
Media  Research  Institute's  biweekly  Transitionvsx  1995,  are  con- 
cise studies  of  poverty,  the  role  of  women,  and  the  health  crisis 
in  Russia.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,  see

Chapter  6,  The  Economy

LIKE  MANY  OTHER  ASPECTS  OF  RUSSIAN  LIFE,  the  Rus- 
sian economy  underwent  a  journey  through  uncharted  waters 
in  the  early  1990s.  First  came  the  disintegration  of  the  centrally 
planned  economy  that  was  a  hallmark  of  the  state-controlled 
economy  and  then  its  replacement  by  an  economy  operating 
on  the  basis  of  market  forces.  Some  of  the  former  communist 
states  of  Central  Europe  began  their  process  of  economic  tran- 
sition two  years  before  Russia  and  have  provided  positive  mod- 
els. But  Russia  lacks  experience  with  market  economies  and 
the  institutions  needed  to  operate  them.  Moreover,  deeply  en- 
trenched remnants  of  central  planning  present  challenges  in 
Russia  that  other  countries  were  able  to  avoid. 

Russia  undertakes  the  transition  with  advantages  and  obsta- 
cles. Although  only  half  the  size  of  the  former  Soviet  economy, 
the  Russian  economy  includes  formidable  assets.  Russia  pos- 
sesses ample  supplies  of  many  of  the  world's  most  valued  natu- 
ral resources,  especially  those  required  to  support  a  modern 
industrialized  economy.  It  also  has  a  well-educated  labor  force 
with  substantial  technical  expertise.  At  the  same  time,  Soviet- 
era  management  practices,  a  decaying  infrastructure,  and  inef- 
ficient supply  systems  hinder  efficient  utilization  of  those 
resources. 

For  nearly  60  years,  the  Russian  economy  and  that  of  the  rest 
of  the  Soviet  Union  operated  on  the  basis  of  central  plan- 
ning— state  control  over  virtually  all  means  of  production  and 
over  investment,  production,  and  consumption  decisions 
throughout  the  economy.  Economic  policy  was  made  accord- 
ing to  directives  from  the  communist  party,  which  controlled 
all  aspects  of  economic  activity.  The  central  planning  system 
left  a  number  of  legacies  with  which  the  Russian  economy  must 
deal  in  its  transition  to  a  market  economy. 

Much  of  the  structure  of  the  Soviet  economy  that  operated 
until  1987  originated  under  the  leadership  of  Joseph  V.  Stalin 
(in  office  1927-53),  with  only  incidental  modifications  made 
between  1953  and  1987.  Five-year  plans  (see  Glossary)  and 
annual  plans  were  the  chief  mechanisms  the  Soviet  govern- 
ment used  to  translate  economic  policies  into  programs. 
According  to  those  policies,  the  State  Planning  Committee 
(Gosudarstvennyy  planovyy  komitet— Gosplan)  formulated 
countrywide  output  targets  for  stipulated  planning  periods. 


297 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Regional  planning  bodies  then  refined  these  targets  for  eco- 
nomic units  such  as  state  industrial  enterprises  and  state  farms 
(sovkhozy;  sing.,  sovkhoz — see  Glossary)  and  collective  farms 
(kolkhozy;  sing.,  kolkhoz — see  Glossary),  each  of  which  had  its 
own  specific  output  plan.  Central  planning  operated  on  the 
assumption  that  if  each  unit  met  or  exceeded  its  plan,  then 
demand  and  supply  would  balance. 

The  government's  role  was  to  ensure  that  the  plans  were  ful- 
filled. Responsibility  for  production  flowed  from  the  top  down. 
At  the  national  level,  some  seventy  government  ministries  and 
state  committees,  each  responsible  for  a  production  sector  or 
subsector,  supervised  the  economic  production  activities  of 
units  within  their  areas  of  responsibility.  Regional  ministerial 
bodies  reported  to  the  national-level  ministries  and  controlled 
economic  units  in  their  respective  geographical  areas. 

The  plans  incorporated  output  targets  for  raw  materials  and 
intermediate  goods  as  well  as  final  goods  and  services.  In  the- 
ory, but  not  in  practice,  the  central  planning  system  ensured  a 
balance  among  the  sectors  throughout  the  economy.  Under 
central  planning,  the  state  performed  the  allocation  functions 
that  prices  perform  in  a  market  system.  In  the  Soviet  economy, 
prices  were  an  accounting  mechanism  only.  The  government 
established  prices  for  all  goods  and  services  based  on  the  role 
of  the  product  in  the  plan  and  on  other  noneconomic  criteria. 
This  pricing  system  produced  anomalies.  For  example,  the 
price  of  bread,  a  traditional  staple  of  the  Russian  diet,  was 
below  the  cost  of  the  wheat  used  to  produce  it.  In  some  cases, 
farmers  fed  their  livestock  bread  rather  than  grain  because 
bread  cost  less.  In  another  example,  rental  fees  for  apartments 
were  set  very  low  to  achieve  social  equity,  yet  housing  was  in 
extremely  short  supply  (see  Housing,  ch.  5).  Soviet  industries 
obtained  raw  materials  such  as  oil,  natural  gas,  and  coal  at 
prices  below  world  market  levels,  encouraging  waste. 

The  central  planning  system  allowed  Soviet  leaders  to  mar- 
shal resources  quickly  in  times  of  crisis,  such  as  the  Nazi  inva- 
sion, and  to  reindustrialize  the  country  during  the  postwar 
period.  The  rapid  development  of  its  defense  and  industrial 
base  after  the  war  permitted  the  Soviet  Union  to  become  a 
superpower. 

The  record  of  Russian  economic  reform  through  the  mid- 
1990s  is  mixed.  The  attempts  and  failures  of  reformers  during 
the  era  of  perestroika  (restructuring — see  Glossary)  in  the 
regime  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in  office  1985-91)  attested  to 


298 


The  Economy 


the  complexity  of  the  challenge.  Since  1991,  under  the  leader- 
ship of  Boris  N.  Yeltsin,  the  country  has  made  great  strides 
toward  developing  a  market  economy  by  implanting  basic 
tenets  such  as  market-determined  prices.  Critical  elements 
such  as  privatization  of  state  enterprises  and  extensive  foreign 
investment  went  into  place  in  the  first  few  years  of  the  post- 
Soviet  period.  But  other  fundamental  parts  of  the  economic 
infrastructure,  such  as  commercial  banking  and  authoritative, 
comprehensive  commercial  laws,  were  absent  or  only  partly  in 
place  by  1996.  Although  by  the  mid-1990s  a  return  to  Soviet-era 
central  planning  seemed  unlikely,  the  configuration  of  the 
post-transition  economy  remained  unpredictable. 

Economists  have  struggled  to  achieve  accurate  measurement 
of  the  Russian  economy,  and  they  have  questioned  the  accuracy 
of  official  Russian  economic  data.  Although  the  market  now 
determines  most  prices,  the  Government  (Russia's  cabinet) 
still  fixes  prices  on  some  goods  and  services,  such  as  utilities 
and  energy.  Furthermore,  the  exchange  rate  of  the  ruble  (for 
value  of  the  ruble — see  Glossary)  to  the  United  States  dollar 
has  changed  rapidly,  and  the  Russian  inflation  rate  has  been 
high.  These  conditions  make  it  difficult  to  convert  economic 
measurements  from  rubles  to  dollars  to  make  statistical  com- 
parisons with  the  United  States  and  other  Western  countries. 

According  to  official  Russian  data,  in  1994  the  national  gross 
domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  was  604  trillion  rubles 
(about  US$207  billion  according  to  the  1994  exchange  rate), 
or  about  4  percent  of  the  United  States  GDP  for  that  year.  But 
this  figure  underestimates  the  size  of  the  Russian  economy. 
Adjusted  by  a  purchasing-power  parity  formula  to  account  for 
the  lower  cost  of  living  in  Russia,  the  1994  Russian  GDP  was 
about  US$678  billion,  making  the  Russian  economy  approxi- 
mately 10  percent  of  the  United  States  economy.  In  1994  the 
adjusted  Russian  GDP  was  US$4,573  per  capita,  approximately 
19  percent  of  that  of  the  United  States.  A  second  important 
measurement  factor  is  the  extremely  active  so-called  shadow 
economy,  which  yields  no  taxes  or  government  statistics  but 
which  a  1996  government  report  quantified  as  accounting  for 
about  50  percent  of  the  economy  and  40  percent  of  its  cash 
turnover. 

Historical  Background 

The  Soviet  economic  system  was  in  place  for  some  six 
decades,  and  elements  of  that  system  remained  in  place  after 


299 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991.  The  leaders  exert- 
ing the  most  substantial  influence  on  that  system  were  its 
founder,  Vladimir  I.  Lenin,  and  his  successor  Stalin,  who  estab- 
lished the  prevailing  patterns  of  collectivization  and  industrial- 
ization that  became  typical  of  the  Soviet  Union's  centrally 
planned  system.  By  1980,  however,  intrinsic  defects  became 
obvious  as  the  national  economy  languished;  shortly  thereafter, 
reform  programs  began  to  alter  the  traditional  structure.  One 
of  the  chief  reformers  of  the  late  1980s,  Boris  Yeltsin,  oversaw 
the  substantial  dissolution  of  the  central  planning  system  in  the 
early  1990s. 

The  Eras  of  Lenin  and  Stalin 

The  basic  foundation  of  the  Soviet  economic  system  was 
established  after  the  Bolsheviks  (see  Glossary)  assumed  power 
in  November  1917  (see  Revolutions  and  Civil  War,  ch.  2).  The 
Bolsheviks  sought  to  mold  a  socialist  society  from  the  ruins  of 
post-World  War  I  tsarist  Russia  by  liberally  reworking  the  ideas 
of  political  philosophers  Karl  Marx  and  Friedrich  Engels. 

Soon  after  the  revolution,  the  Bolsheviks  published  decrees 
nationalizing  land,  most  industry  (all  enterprises  employing 
more  than  five  workers),  foreign  trade,  and  banking.  The  peas- 
ants took  control  of  the  land  from  the  aristocracy  and  farmed  it 
in  small  parcels. 

Beginning  in  1918,  the  new  regime  already  was  fighting  for 
its  survival  in  the  Russian  Civil  War  against  noncommunist 
forces  known  as  the  Whites.  The  war  forced  the  regime  to  orga- 
nize the  economy  and  place  it  on  a  war  footing  under  a  strin- 
gent policy  known  as  war  communism.  Under  such  conditions, 
the  economy  performed  poorly.  In  1920  agricultural  output 
had  attained  only  half  of  its  pre-World  War  I  level,  foreign  trade 
had  virtually  ceased,  and  industrial  production  had  fallen  to 
only  a  small  fraction  of  its  prewar  levels.  Beginning  in  1921, 
Lenin  led  a  tactical  retreat  from  state  control  of  the  economy 
in  an  effort  to  reignite  production.  His  new  program,  called 
the  New  Economic  Policy  (Novaya  ekonomicheskaya  politika — 
NEP;  see  Glossary),  permitted  some  private  activity,  especially 
in  agriculture,  light  industry,  and  services  (see  Lenin's  Leader- 
ship, ch.  2).  However,  heavy  industry,  transportation,  foreign 
trade,  and  banking  remained  under  state  control. 

Lenin  died  in  1924,  and  by  1927  the  government  had  nearly 
abandoned  the  NEP.  Stalin  sought  a  rapid  transformation  from 
an  agricultural,  peasant-based  country  into  a  modern  indus-

trial  power  and  initiated  the  country's  First  Five- Year  Plan 
(1928-32).  Under  the  plan,  the  Soviet  government  began  the 
nationwide  collectivization  of  agriculture  to  ensure  production 
and  distribution  of  food  supplies  to  the  growing  industrial  sec- 
tor and  to  free  labor  for  industry  (see  Industrialization  and 
Collectivization,  ch.  2) .  By  the  end  of  the  five-year  period,  how- 
ever, agricultural  output  had  declined  by  23  percent,  according 
to  official  statistics.  The  chemical,  textile,  housing,  and  con- 
sumer goods  and  services  industries  were  also  performing 
poorly.  Heavy  industry  exceeded  the  plan  targets,  but  only  at  a 
great  cost  to  the  rest  of  the  economy. 

By  the  Third  Five-Year  Plan  (1938-41),  the  Soviet  economy 
was  once  again  on  a  war  footing,  devoting  increasing  amounts 
of  resources  to  the  military  sector  in  response  to  the  rise  of 
Nazi  Germany.  The  Nazi  invasion  in  1941  forced  the  govern- 
ment to  abandon  the  five-year  plan  and  concentrate  all 
resources  on  support  for  the  military  sector.  This  period  also 
included  the  large-scale  evacuation  of  much  of  the  country's 
industrial  production  capacity  from  European  Russia  to  the 
Urals  and  Central  Asia  to  prevent  further  war  damage  to  its 
economic  base.  The  Fourth  Five-Year  Plan  (1946-50)  was  one 
of  repairing  and  rebuilding  after  the  war. 

Throughout  the  Stalin  era,  the  government  forced  the  pace 
of  industrial  growth  by  shifting  resources  from  other  sectors  to 
heavy  industry.  The  Soviet  consumer  received  little  priority  in 
the  planning  process.  By  1950  real  household  consumption 
had  climbed  to  a  level  only  marginally  higher  than  that  of 
1928.  Although  Stalin  died  in  1953,  his  emphasis  on  heavy 
industry  and  central  control  over  all  aspects  of  economic  deci- 
sion making  remained  virtually  intact  well  into  the  1980s. 

The  Postwar  Growth  Period 

Soviet  economic  growth  rates  during  the  postwar  period 
appeared  impressive.  Between  the  early  1950s  and  1975,  the 
Soviet  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  increased 
an  average  of  about  5  percent  per  year,  outpacing  the  average 
growth  of  the  United  States  and  keeping  pace  with  many  West 
European  economies — albeit  after  having  started  from  a  much 
lower  point. 

However,  these  aggregate  growth  figures  hid  gross  inefficien- 
cies that  are  typical  of  centrally  planned  systems.  The  Soviet 
Union  was  able  to  attain  impressive  growth  through  "extensive 
investments,"  that  is,  by  infusing  the  economy  with  large  inputs 


301 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

of  labor,  capital,  and  natural  resources.  But  the  state-set  prices 
did  not  reflect  the  actual  costs  of  inputs,  leading  to  enormous 
misallocation  and  waste  of  resources.  In  addition,  the  heavily 
bureaucratic  economic  decision-making  system  and  the  strong 
emphasis  on  meeting  targets  discouraged  the  introduction  of 
new  technologies  that  could  improve  productivity.  Central 
planning  also  skewed  the  distribution  of  investments  through- 
out the  economy. 

The  aggregate  Soviet  growth  figures  also  did  not  reveal 
either  the  generally  poor  quality  of  Soviet  goods  and  services 
that  resulted  from  the  state  monopoly  over  production  or  the 
lack  of  priority  given  the  consumer  sector  in  the  planning  pro- 
cess. Eventually,  diminishing  returns  from  labor,  capital,  and 
other  inputs  led  to  a  severe  slowdown  in  Soviet  economic 
growth.  Furthermore,  the  availability  of  inputs,  especially  capi- 
tal, labor,  and  technology,  was  decreasing.  Declining  birth 
rates,  particularly  in  the  European  republics  of  the  Soviet 
Union,  placed  constraints  on  the  labor  supply.  By  the  mid- 
1970s  and  into  the  1980s,  average  Soviet  GNP  growth  rates  had 
plummeted  to  about  2  percent,  less  than  half  the  rates  of  the 
immediate  postwar  period. 

Although  such  rates  might  have  been  acceptable  in  a 
mature,  modern  industrialized  economy,  the  Soviet  Union  still 
trailed  far  behind  the  United  States,  other  Western  economies, 
and  Japan,  and  in  the  1980s  another  challenge  arose  from  the 
newly  industrializing  countries  of  East  Asia.  Furthermore,  the 
standard  of  living  of  the  average  Russian  citizen,  which  had 
always  been  below  that  of  the  United  States,  was  declining.  In 
the  1980s,  with  the  advent  of  modern  communications  that 
even  Soviet  censors  found  impossible  to  restrict,  Soviet  citizens 
began  to  recognize  their  relative  position  and  to  question  the 
rationale  of  their  country's  economic  policies.  This  was  the 
atmosphere  in  which  the  Gorbachev  regime  undertook  serious 
economic  reform  in  the  late  1980s. 

Reform  and  Resistance 

During  several  distinct  periods,  Soviet  leaders  attempted  to 
reform  the  economy  to  make  the  Soviet  system  more  efficient. 
In  1957,  for  example,  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  (in  office  1953-64) 
tried  to  decentralize  state  control  by  eliminating  many  national 
ministries  and  placing  responsibility  for  implementing  plans 
under  the  control  of  newly  created  regional  economic  coun- 
cils. These  reforms  produced  their  own  inefficiencies.  In  1965 


302 


The  Economy 


Soviet  prime  minister  Aleksey  Kosygin  (in  office  1964-80) 
introduced  a  package  of  reforms  that  reestablished  central  gov- 
ernment control  but  reformed  prices  and  established  new 
bonuses  and  production  norms  to  stimulate  economic  produc- 
tivity. Under  reforms  in  the  1970s,  Soviet  leaders  attempted  to 
streamline  the  decision-making  process  by  combining  enter- 
prises into  associations,  which  received  some  localized  deci- 
sion-making authority. 

Because  none  of  these  reforms  challenged  the  fundamental 
notion  of  state  control,  the  root  cause  of  the  inefficiencies 
remained.  Resistance  to  reform  was  strong  because  central 
planning  was  heavily  embedded  in  the  Soviet  economic  struc- 
ture. Its  various  elements — planned  output,  state  ownership  of 
property,  administrative  pricing,  artificially  established  wage 
levels,  and  currency  inconvertibility — were  interrelated.  Funda- 
mental reforms  required  changing  the  whole  system  rather 
than  one  or  two  elements.  Central  planning  also  was  heavily 
entrenched  in  the  Soviet  political  structure.  A  huge  bureau- 
cracy was  in  place  from  the  national  to  the  local  level  in  both 
the  party  and  the  government,  and  officials  within  that  system 
enjoyed  the  many  privileges  of  the  Soviet  elite  class.  Such 
vested  interests  yielded  formidable  resistance  to  major  changes 
in  the  Soviet  economic  system;  the  Russian  system,  in  which 
many  of  the  same  figures  have  prospered,  suffers  from  the 
same  handicap. 

Upon  assuming  power  in  March  1985,  Gorbachev  took  mea- 
sures intended  to  immediately  resume  the  growth  rates  of  ear- 
lier decades.  The  Twelfth  Five- Year  Plan  (1986-90)  called  for 
the  Soviet  national  income  to  increase  an  average  of  4.1  per- 
cent annually  and  labor  productivity  to  increase  4.6  percent 
annually — rates  that  the  Soviet  Union  had  not  achieved  since 
the  early  1970s.  Gorbachev  sought  to  improve  labor  productiv- 
ity by  implementing  an  anti-alcohol  campaign  that  severely 
restricted  the  sale  of  vodka  and  other  spirits  and  by  establishing 
work  attendance  requirements  to  reduce  chronic  absenteeism. 
Gorbachev  also  shifted  investment  priorities  toward  the 
machine-building  and  metalworking  sectors  that  could  make 
the  most  significant  contribution  to  retool  and  modernize 
existing  factories,  rather  than  building  new  factories.  Gor- 
bachev changed  Soviet  investment  strategy  from  extensive 
investing  to  intensive  investing  that  focused  on  elements  most 
critical  to  achieving  the  stated  goal. 


303 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

During  his  first  few  years,  Gorbachev  also  restructured  the 
government  bureaucracy  (see  Perestroika,  ch.  2).  He  combined 
ministries  responsible  for  high-priority  economic  sectors  into 
bureaus  or  state  committees  in  order  to  reduce  staff  and  red 
tape  and  to  streamline  the  administration.  In  addition,  Gor- 
bachev established  a  state  organization  for  quality  control  to 
improve  the  quality  of  Soviet  production. 

The  Perestroika  Program 

The  Soviet  economic  reforms  during  Gorbachev's  initial 
period  (1985-86)  were  similar  to  the  reforms  of  previous 
regimes:  they  modified  the  Stalinist  system  without  making 
truly  fundamental  changes.  The  basic  principles  of  central 
planning  remained.  The  measures  proved  to  be  insufficient,  as 
economic  growth  rates  continued  to  decline  and  the  economy 
faced  severe  shortages.  Gorbachev  and  his  team  of  economic 
advisers  then  introduced  more  fundamental  reforms,  which 
became  known  as  perestroika  (restructuring).  At  the  June  1987 
plenary  session  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Communist 
Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU — see  Glossary),  Gorbachev 
presented  his  "basic  theses,"  which  laid  the  political  foundation 
of  economic  reform  for  the  remainder  of  the  decade. 

In  July  1987,  the  Supreme  Soviet  passed  the  Law  on  State 
Enterprises.  The  law  stipulated  that  state  enterprises  were  free 
to  determine  output  levels  based  on  demand  from  consumers 
and  other  enterprises.  Enterprises  had  to  fulfill  state  orders, 
but  they  could  dispose  of  the  remaining  output  as  they  saw  fit. 
Enterprises  bought  inputs  from  suppliers  at  negotiated  con- 
tract prices.  Under  the  law,  enterprises  became  self-financing; 
that  is,  they  had  to  cover  expenses  (wages,  taxes,  supplies,  and 
debt  service)  through  revenues.  No  longer  was  the  government 
to  rescue  unprofitable  enterprises  that  could  face  bankruptcy. 
Finally,  the  law  shifted  control  over  the  enterprise  operations 
from  ministries  to  elected  workers'  collectives.  Gosplan's 
responsibilities  were  to  supply  general  guidelines  and  national 
investment  priorities,  not  to  formulate  detailed  production 
plans. 

The  Law  on  Cooperatives,  enacted  in  May  1987,  was  perhaps 
the  most  radical  of  the  economic  reforms  during  the  early  part 
of  the  Gorbachev  regime.  For  the  first  time  since  Lenin's  NEP, 
the  law  permitted  private  ownership  of  businesses  in  the  ser- 
vices, manufacturing,  and  foreign-trade  sectors.  The  law  ini- 
tially imposed  high  taxes  and  employment  restrictions,  but  it 


304 


The  Economy 


later  revised  these  to  avoid  discouraging  private-sector  activity. 
Under  this  provision,  cooperative  restaurants,  shops,  and  man- 
ufacturers became  part  of  the  Soviet  scene. 

Gorbachev  brought  perestroika  to  the  Soviet  Union's  foreign 
economic  sector  with  measures  that  Soviet  economists  consid- 
ered bold  at  that  time.  His  program  virtually  eliminated  the 
monopoly  that  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  had  had  on  most 
trade  operations.  It  permitted  the  ministries  of  the  various 
industrial  and  agricultural  branches  to  conduct  foreign  trade 
in  sectors  under  their  responsibility  rather  than  having  to  oper- 
ate indirectly  through  the  bureaucracy  of  trade  ministry  orga- 
nizations. In  addition,  regional  and  local  organizations  and 
individual  state  enterprises  were  permitted  to  conduct  foreign 
trade.  This  change  was  an  attempt  to  redress  a  major  imperfec- 
tion in  the  Soviet  foreign  trade  regime:  the  lack  of  contact 
between  Soviet  end  users  and  suppliers  and  their  foreign  part- 
ners. 

The  most  significant  of  Gorbachev's  reforms  in  the  foreign 
economic  sector  allowed  foreigners  to  invest  in  the  Soviet 
Union  in  the  form  of  joint  ventures  with  Soviet  ministries,  state 
enterprises,  and  cooperatives.  The  original  version  of  the 
Soviet  Joint  Venture  Law,  which  went  into  effect  in  June  1987, 
limited  foreign  shares  of  a  Soviet  venture  to  49  percent  and 
required  that  Soviet  citizens  occupy  the  positions  of  chairman 
and  general  manager.  After  potential  Western  partners  com- 
plained, the  government  revised  the  regulations  to  allow 
majority  foreign  ownership  and  control.  Under  the  terms  of 
the  Joint  Venture  Law,  the  Soviet  partner  supplied  labor,  infra- 
structure, and  a  potentially  large  domestic  market.  The  foreign 
partner  supplied  capital,  technology,  entrepreneurial  exper- 
tise, and,  in  many  cases,  products  and  services  of  world  compet- 
itive quality. 

Although  they  were  bold  in  the  context  of  Soviet  history, 
Gorbachev's  attempts  at  economic  reform  were  not  radical 
enough  to  restart  the  country's  chronically  sluggish  economy 
in  the  late  1980s.  The  reforms  made  some  inroads  in  decentral- 
ization, but  Gorbachev  and  his  team  left  intact  most  of  the  fun- 
damental elements  of  the  Stalinist  system — price  controls, 
inconvertibility  of  the  ruble,  exclusion  of  private  property  own- 
ership, and  the  government  monopoly  over  most  means  of  pro- 
duction. 

By  1990  the  government  had  virtually  lost  control  over  eco- 
nomic conditions.  Government  spending  increased  sharply  as 


305 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

an  increasing  number  of  unprofitable  enterprises  required 
state  support  and  consumer  price  subsidies  continued.  Tax  rev- 
enues declined  because  revenues  from  the  sales  of  vodka  plum- 
meted during  the  anti-alcohol  campaign  and  because  republic 
and  local  governments  withheld  tax  revenues  from  the  central 
government  under  the  growing  spirit  of  regional  autonomy. 
The  elimination  of  central  control  over  production  decisions, 
especially  in  the  consumer  goods  sector,  led  to  the  breakdown 
in  traditional  supplier-producer  relationships  without  contrib- 
uting to  the  formation  of  new  ones.  Thus,  instead  of  streamlin- 
ing the  system,  Gorbachev's  decentralization  caused  new 
production  bottlenecks. 

Unforeseen  Results  of  Reform 

Gorbachev's  new  system  bore  the  characteristics  of  neither 
central  planning  nor  a  market  economy.  Instead,  the  Soviet 
economy  went  from  stagnation  to  deterioration.  At  the  end  of 
1991,  when  the  union  officially  dissolved,  the  national  econ- 
omy was  in  a  virtual  tailspin.  In  1991  the  Soviet  GDP  had 
declined  17  percent  and  was  declining  at  an  accelerating  rate. 
Overt  inflation  was  becoming  a  major  problem.  Between  1990 
and  1991,  retail  prices  in  the  Soviet  Union  increased  140  per- 
cent. 

Under  these  conditions,  the  general  quality  of  life  for  Soviet 
consumers  deteriorated.  Consumers  traditionally  faced  short- 
ages of  durable  goods,  but  under  Gorbachev,  food,  wearing 
apparel,  and  other  basic  necessities  were  in  short  supply. 
Fueled  by  the  liberalized  atmosphere  of  Gorbachev's  glasnost 
(literally,  public  voicing — see  Glossary)  and  by  the  general 
improvement  in  information  access  in  the  late  1980s,  public 
dissatisfaction  with  economic  conditions  was  much  more  overt 
than  ever  before  in  the  Soviet  period.  The  foreign-trade  sector 
of  the  Soviet  economy  also  showed  signs  of  deterioration.  The 
total  Soviet  hard-currency  (see  Glossary)  debt  increased  appre- 
ciably, and  the  Soviet  Union,  which  had  established  an  impec- 
cable record  for  debt  repayment  in  earlier  decades,  had 
accumulated  sizable  arrearages  by  1990. 

In  sum,  the  Soviet  Union  left  a  legacy  of  economic  ineffi- 
ciency and  deterioration  to  the  fifteen  constituent  republics 
after  its  breakup  in  December  1991.  Arguably,  the  shortcom- 
ings of  the  Gorbachev  reforms  had  contributed  to  the  eco- 
nomic decline  and  eventual  destruction  of  the  Soviet  Union, 
leaving  Russia  and  the  other  successor  states  to  pick  up  the

pieces  and  to  try  to  mold  modern,  market-driven  economies. 
At  the  same  time,  the  Gorbachev  programs  did  start  Russia  on 
the  precarious  road  to  full-scale  economic  reform.  Perestroika 
broke  Soviet  taboos  against  private  ownership  of  some  types  of 
business,  foreign  investment  in  the  Soviet  Union,  foreign  trade, 
and  decentralized  economic  decision  making,  all  of  which 
made  it  virtually  impossible  for  later  policy  makers  to  turn  back 
the  clock. 

Economic  Reform  in  the  1990s 

Two  fundamental  and  interdependent  goals — macroeco- 
nomic  stabilization  and  economic  restructuring — mark  the 
transition  from  central  planning  to  a  market-based  economy. 
The  former  entails  implementing  fiscal  and  monetary  policies 
that  promote  economic  growth  in  an  environment  of  stable 
prices  and  exchange  rates.  The  latter  requires  establishing  the 
commercial,  legal,  and  institutional  entities — banks,  private 
property,  and  commercial  legal  codes — that  permit  the  econ- 
omy to  operate  efficiently.  Opening  domestic  markets  to  for- 
eign trade  and  investment,  thus  linking  the  economy  with  the 
rest  of  the  world,  is  an  important  aid  in  reaching  these  goals. 
Under  Gorbachev,  the  regime  failed  to  address  these  funda- 


307 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

mental  goals.  At  the  time  of  the  Soviet  Union's  demise,  the 
Yeltsin  government  of  the  Russian  Republic  had  begun  to 
attack  the  problems  of  macroeconomic  stabilization  and  eco- 
nomic restructuring.  As  of  mid-1996,  the  results  were  mixed. 

The  Yeltsin  Economic  Program 

In  October  1991,  two  months  before  the  official  collapse  of 
the  Soviet  regime  and  two  months  after  the  August  1991  coup 
against  the  Gorbachev  regime,  Yeltsin  and  his  advisers,  includ- 
ing reform  economist  Yegor  Gaydar,  established  a  program  of 
radical  economic  reforms.  The  Russian  parliament,  the 
Supreme  Soviet,  also  extended  decree  powers  to  the  president 
for  one  year  to  implement  the  program.  The  program  was 
ambitious,  and  the  record  to  date  indicates  that  the  goals  for 
macroeconomic  stabilization  and  economic  restructuring  pro- 
grams may  have  been  unrealistically  high.  Another  complica- 
tion in  the  Yeltsin  reform  program  is  that  since  1991  both 
political  and  economic  authority  have  devolved  significantly 
from  the  national  to  the  regional  level;  in  a  series  of  agree- 
ments with  the  majority  of  Russia's  twenty-one  republics  and 
several  other  subnational  jurisdictions,  Moscow  has  granted  a 
variety  of  special  rights  and  powers  having  important  economic 
overtones. 

Macroeconomic  Stabilization  Measures 

The  program  laid  out  a  number  of  macroeconomic  policy 
measures  to  achieve  stabilization.  It  called  for  sharp  reductions 
in  government  spending,  targeting  outlays  for  public  invest- 
ment projects,  defense,  and  producer  and  consumer  subsidies. 
The  program  aimed  at  reducing  the  government  budget  deficit 
from  its  1991  level  of  20  percent  of  GDP  to  9  percent  of  GDP  by 
the  second  half  of  1992  and  to  3  percent  by  1993.  The  govern- 
ment imposed  new  taxes,  and  tax  collection  was  to  be 
upgraded  to  increase  state  revenues.  In  the  monetary  sphere, 
the  economic  program  required  the  Russian  Central  Bank 
(RCB)  to  cut  subsidized  credits  to  enterprises  and  to  restrict 
money  supply  growth.  The  program  called  for  the  shrinkage  of 
inflation  from  12  percent  per  month  in  1991  to  3  percent  per 
month  in  mid-1993. 

Economic  Restructuring  Measures 

Immediately  after  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  was 
announced,  the  Government  lifted  price  controls  on  90  per- 


308 


The  Economy 


cent  of  consumer  goods  and  80  percent  of  intermediate  goods. 
It  raised,  but  still  controlled,  prices  on  energy  and  food  staples 
such  as  bread,  sugar,  vodka,  and  dairy  products.  These  mea- 
sures were  to  establish  a  realistic  relationship  between  produc- 
tion and  consumption  that  had  been  lacking  in  the  central 
planning  system. 

To  encourage  the  development  of  the  private  sector,  funda- 
mental changes  were  made  in  the  tax  system,  including  intro- 
duction of  a  value-added  tax  (VAT — see  Glossary)  of  28 
percent  on  most  transactions,  a  progressive  income  tax,  and  a 
tax  on  business  income;  revisions  in  the  system  of  import  tariffs 
and  export  taxes;  new  taxes  on  domestic  energy  use  to  encour- 
age conservation  (a  necessary  step  because  energy  prices  were 
still  controlled) ;  and  new  taxes  on  oil  and  natural  gas  exports 
to  narrow  the  gap  between  subsidized  domestic  prices  and 
world  prices  and  to  prevent  domestic  energy  shortages  (see 
Taxation,  this  ch.).  A  fixed  exchange  rate  was  to  be  established 
for  the  ruble,  which  then  would  become  convertible.  Many 
restrictions  on  foreign  trade  and  investment  also  were  to  be 
lifted  to  expose  Russia  to  the  discipline  of  world  prices. 

Monetary  and  Fiscal  Policies 

In  1992  and  1993,  the  Government  expanded  the  money 
supply  and  credits  at  explosive  rates  that  led  directly  to  high 
inflation  and  to  a  deterioration  in  the  exchange  rate  of  the 
ruble.  In  January  1992,  the  Government  clamped  down  on 
money  and  credit  creation  at  the  same  time  that  it  lifted  price 
controls.  However,  beginning  in  February  the  RCB  loosened 
the  reins  on  the  money  supply.  In  the  second  and  third  quar- 
ters of  1992,  the  money  supply  had  increased  at  especially 
sharp  rates  of  34  and  30  percent,  respectively,  and  by  the  end  of 
1992,  the  Russian  money  supply  had  increased  by  eighteen 
times. 

The  sharp  increase  in  the  money  supply  was  influenced  by 
large  foreign  currency  deposits  that  state-run  enterprises  and 
individuals  had  built  up  and  by  the  depreciation  of  the  ruble. 
Enterprises  drew  on  these  deposits  to  pay  wages  and  other 
expenses  after  the  Government  had  tightened  restrictions  on 
monetary  emissions.  Commercial  banks  monetized  enterprise 
debts  by  drawing  down  accounts  in  foreign  banks  and  drawing 
on  privileged  access  to  accounts  in  the  RCB  (see  Banking  and 
Finance,  this  ch.).

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Government  efforts  to  control  credit  expansion  also  proved 
ephemeral  in  the  early  years  of  the  transition.  Domestic  credit 
increased  about  nine  times  between  the  end  of  1991  and  1992. 
The  credit  expansion  was  caused  in  part  by  the  buildup  of 
interenterprise  arrears  and  the  RGB's  subsequent  financing  of 
those  arrears.  The  Government  restricted  financing  to  state 
enterprises  after  it  lifted  controls  on  prices  in  January  1992,  but 
enterprises  faced  cash  shortages  because  the  decontrol  of 
prices  cut  demand  for  their  products.  Instead  of  curtailing  pro- 
duction, most  firms  chose  to  build  up  inventories.  To  support 
continued  production  under  these  circumstances,  enterprises 
relied  on  loans  from  other  enterprises.  By  mid-1992,  when  the 
amount  of  unpaid  interenterprise  loans  had  reached  3.2  tril- 
lion rubles  (about  US$20  billion),  the  government  froze  inter- 
enterprise debts.  Shortly  thereafter,  the  government  provided 
181  billion  rubles  (about  US$1.1  billion)  in  credits  to  enter- 
prises that  were  still  holding  debt. 

The  Government  also  failed  to  constrain  its  own  expendi- 
tures in  this  period,  partially  under  the  influence  of  the  conser- 
vative Supreme  Soviet,  which  encouraged  the  Soviet-style 
financing  of  favored  industries.  By  the  end  of  1992,  the  Russian 
budget  deficit  was  20  percent  of  GDP,  much  higher  than  the  5 
percent  projected  under  the  economic  program  and  stipulated 
under  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary) 
conditions  for  international  funding.  This  budget  deficit  was 
financed  largely  by  expanding  the  money  supply.  These  ill- 
advised  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  resulted  in  an  inflation 
rate  of  over  2,000  percent  in  1992. 

In  late  1992,  deteriorating  economic  conditions  and  a  sharp 
conflict  with  the  parliament  led  Yeltsin  to  dismiss  economic 
reform  advocate  Yegor  Gaydar  as  prime  minister.  Gaydar's  suc- 
cessor was  Viktor  Chernomyrdin,  a  former  head  of  the  State 
Natural  Gas  Company  (Gazprom),  who  was  considered  less 
favorable  to  economic  reform. 

Chernomyrdin  formed  a  new  government  with  Boris 
Fedorov,  an  economic  reformer,  as  deputy  prime  minister  and 
finance  minister.  Fedorov  considered  macroeconomic  stabiliza- 
tion a  primary  goal  of  Russian  economic  policy.  In  January 
1993,  Fedorov  announced  a  so-called  anticrisis  program  to  con- 
trol inflation  through  tight  monetary  and  fiscal  policies.  Under 
the  program,  the  Government  would  control  money  and  credit 
emissions  by  requiring  the  RCB  to  increase  interest  rates  on 
credits  by  issuing  government  bonds,  by  partially  financing 


310 


The  Economy 


budget  deficits,  and  by  starting  to  close  inefficient  state  enter- 
prises. Budget  deficits  were  to  be  brought  under  control  by  lim- 
iting wage  increases  for  state  enterprises,  by  establishing 
quarterly  budget  deficit  targets,  and  by  providing  a  more  effi- 
cient social  safety  net  for  the  unemployed  and  pensioners. 

The  printing  of  money  and  domestic  credit  expansion  mod- 
erated somewhat  in  1993.  In  a  public  confrontation  with  the 
parliament,  Yeltsin  won  a  referendum  on  his  economic  reform 
policies  that  may  have  given  the  reformers  some  political  clout 
to  curb  state  expenditures.  In  May  1993,  the  Ministry  of 
Finance  and  the  RCB  agreed  to  macroeconomic  measures, 
such  as  reducing  subsidies  and  increasing  revenues,  to  stabilize 
the  economy.  The  RCB  was  to  raise  the  discount  lending  rate  to 
reflect  inflation.  Based  on  positive  early  results  from  this  policy, 
the  IMF  extended  the  first  payment  of  US$1.5  billion  to  Russia 
from  a  special  Systemic  Transformation  Facility  (STF)  the  fol- 
lowing July. 

Fedorov's  anticrisis  program  and  the  Government's  accord 
with  the  RCB  had  some  effect.  In  the  first  three  quarters  of 
1993,  the  RCB  held  money  expansion  to  a  monthly  rate  of  19 
percent.  It  also  substantially  moderated  the  expansion  of  cred- 
its during  that  period.  The  1993  annual  inflation  rate  was 
around  1,000  percent,  a  sharp  improvement  over  1992,  but  still 
very  high.  The  improvement  figures  were  exaggerated,  how- 
ever, because  state  expenditures  had  been  delayed  from  the 
last  quarter  of  1993  to  the  first  quarter  of  1994.  State  enterprise 
arrears,  for  example,  had  built  up  in  1993  to  about  15  trillion 
rubles  (about  US$13  billion,  according  to  the  mid-1993 
exchange  rate). 

In  June  1994,  Chernomyrdin  presented  a  set  of  moderate 
reforms  calculated  to  accommodate  the  more  conservative  ele- 
ments of  the  Government  and  parliament  while  placating 
reformers  and  Western  creditors.  The  prime  minister  pledged 
to  move  ahead  with  restructuring  the  economy  and  pursuing 
fiscal  and  monetary  policies  conducive  to  macroeconomic  sta- 
bilization. But  stabilization  was  undermined  by  the  RCB,  which 
issued  credits  to  enterprises  at  subsidized  rates,  and  by  strong 
pressure  from  industrial  and  agricultural  lobbies  seeking  addi- 
tional credits. 

By  October  1994,  inflation,  which  had  been  reduced  by 
tighter  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  early  in  1994,  began  to  soar 
once  again  to  dangerous  levels.  On  October  11,  a  day  that 
became  known  as  Black  Tuesday,  the  value  of  the  ruble  on 


311 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

interbank  exchange  markets  plunged  by  27  percent.  Although 
experts  presented  a  number  of  theories  to  explain  the  drop, 
including  the  existence  of  a  conspiracy,  the  loosening  of  credit 
and  monetary  controls  clearly  was  a  significant  cause  of  declin- 
ing confidence  in  the  Russian  economy  and  its  currency. 

In  late  1994,  Yeltsin  reasserted  his  commitment  to  macroeco- 
nomic  stabilization  by  firing  Viktor  Gerashchenko,  head  of  the 
RCB,  and  nominating  Tat'yana  Paramonova  as  his  replace- 
ment. Although  reformers  in  the  Russian  government  and  the 
IMF  and  other  Western  supporters  greeted  the  appointment 
with  skepticism,  Paramonova  was  able  to  implement  a  tight 
monetary  policy  that  ended  cheap  credits  and  restrained  inter- 
est rates  (although  the  money  supply  fluctuated  in  1995).  Fur- 
thermore, the  parliament  passed  restrictions  on  the  use  of 
monetary  policy  to  finance  the  state  debt,  and  the  Ministry  of 
Finance  began  to  issue  government  bonds  at  market  rates  to 
finance  the  deficits. 

The  Government  also  began  to  address  the  interenterprise 
debt  that  had  been  feeding  inflation.  The  1995  budget  draft, 
which  was  proposed  in  September  1994,  included  a  commit- 
ment to  reducing  inflation  and  the  budget  deficit  to  levels 
acceptable  to  the  IMF,  with  the  aim  of  qualifying  for  additional 
international  funding.  In  this  budget  proposal,  the  Cherno- 
myrdin government  sent  a  signal  that  it  no  longer  would  toler- 
ate soft  credits  and  loose  budget  constraints,  and  that  stabiliza- 
tion must  be  a  top  government  priority. 

During  most  of  1995,  the  government  maintained  its  com- 
mitment to  tight  fiscal  constraints,  and  budget  deficits 
remained  within  prescribed  parameters.  However,  in  1995  pres- 
sures mounted  to  increase  government  spending  to  alleviate 
wage  arrearages,  which  were  becoming  a  chronic  problem 
within  state  enterprises,  and  to  improve  the  increasingly  tat- 
tered social  safety  net.  In  fact,  in  1995  and  1996  the  state's  fail- 
ure to  pay  many  such  obligations  (as  well  as  the  wages  of  most 
state  workers)  was  a  major  factor  in  keeping  Russia's  budget 
deficit  at  a  moderate  level  (see  Social  Welfare,  ch.  5).  Condi- 
tions changed  by  the  second  half  of  1995.  The  members  of  the 
State  Duma  (beginning  in  1994,  the  lower  house  of  the  Federal 
Assembly,  Russia's  parliament)  faced  elections  in  December, 
and  Yeltsin  faced  dim  prospects  in  his  1996  presidential  reelec- 
tion bid.  Therefore,  political  conditions  caused  both  Duma 
deputies  and  the  president  to  make  promises  to  increase 
spending. 


312 


The  Economy 


In  addition,  late  in  1995  Yeltsin  dismissed  Anatoliy  Chubays, 
one  of  the  last  economic  reform  advocates  remaining  in  a  top 
Government  position,  as  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of 
economic  policy.  In  place  of  Chubays,  Yeltsin  named  Vladimir 
Kadannikov,  a  former  automobile  plant  manager  whose  views 
were  antireform.  This  move  raised  concerns  in  Russia  and  the 
West  about  Yeltsin's  commitment  to  economic  reform.  Another 
casualty  of  the  political  atmosphere  was  RCB  chairman  Para- 
monova,  whose  nomination  had  remained  a  source  of  contro- 
versy between  the  State  Duma  and  the  Government.  In 
November  1995,  Yeltsin  was  forced  to  replace  her  with  Sergey 
Dubinin,  a  Chernomyrdin  protege  who  continued  the  tight- 
money  policy  that  Paramonova  had  established. 

By  mid-1996  many  Duma  deputies  raised  concerns  about  the 
Government's  failure  to  meet  its  tax  revenue  targets.  Revenue 
shortages  were  blamed  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  a 
heavy  tax  burden  that  encourages  noncompliance  and  an  inef- 
ficient and  corrupt  tax  collection  system.  A  variety  of  tax  collec- 
tion reforms  were  proposed  in  the  parliament  and  the 
Government,  but  by  1996  Russian  enterprises  and  regional 
authorities  had  established  a  strong  pattern  of  noncompliance 
with  national  tax  regulations,  and  the  Federal  Tax  Police  Ser- 
vice was  ineffectual  in  apprehending  violators  (see  Ministry  of 
Internal  Affairs  (MVD),  ch.  10). 

Inflation 

In  1992,  the  first  year  of  economic  reform,  retail  prices  in 
Russia  increased  by  2,520  percent.  A  major  cause  of  the 
increase  was  the  decontrol  of  most  prices  in  January  1992,  a 
step  that  prompted  an  average  price  increase  of  245  percent  in 
that  month  alone.  By  1993  the  annual  rate  had  declined  to  840 
percent,  still  a  very  high  figure.  In  1994  the  inflation  rate  had 
improved  to  224  percent. 

Trends  in  annual  inflation  rates  mask  variations  in  monthly 
rates,  however.  In  1994,  for  example,  the  Government  man- 
aged to  reduce  monthly  rates  from  21  percent  in  January  to  4 
percent  in  August,  but  rates  climbed  once  again,  to  16.4  per- 
cent by  December  and  18  percent  by  January  1995.  Instability 
in  Russian  monetary  policy  caused  the  variations.  After  tighten- 
ing the  flow  of  money  early  in  1994,  the  Government  loosened 
its  restrictions  in  response  to  demands  for  credits  by  agricul- 
ture, industries  in  the  Far  North,  and  some  favored  large  enter- 
prises. In  1995  the  pattern  was  avoided  more  successfully  by 


313 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

maintaining  the  tight  monetary  policy  adopted  early  in  the 
year  and  by  passing  a  relatively  stringent  budget.  Thus,  the 
monthly  inflation  rate  held  virtually  steady  below  5  percent  in 
the  last  quarter  of  the  year.  For  the  first  half  of  1996,  the  infla- 
tion rate  was  16.5  percent.  However,  experts  noted  that  control 
of  inflation  was  aided  substantially  by  the  failure  to  pay  wages 
to  workers  in  state  enterprises,  a  policy  that  kept  prices  low  by 
depressing  demand. 

Exchange  Rates 

An  important  symptom  of  Russian  macroeconomic  instabil- 
ity has  been  severe  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate  of  the 
ruble.  From  July  1992,  when  the  ruble  first  could  be  legally 
exchanged  for  United  States  dollars,  to  October  1995,  the  rate 
of  exchange  between  the  ruble  and  the  dollar  declined  from 
144  rubles  per  US$1  to  around  5,000  per  US$1.  Prior  to  July 
1992,  the  ruble's  rate  was  set  artificially  at  a  highly  overvalued 
level.  But  rapid  changes  in  the  nominal  rate  (the  rate  that  does 
not  account  for  inflation)  reflected  the  overall  macroeconomic 
instability.  The  most  drastic  example  of  such  fluctuation  was 
the  Black  Tuesday  (1994)  2V  percent  reduction  in  the  ruble's 
value. 

In  July  1995,  the  RCB  announced  its  intention  to  maintain 
the  ruble  within  a  band  of  4,300  to  4,900  per  US$1  through 
October  1995,  but  it  later  extended  the  period  to  June  1996. 
The  announcement  reflected  strengthened  fiscal  and  mone- 
tary policies  and  the  buildup  of  reserves  with  which  the  Gov- 
ernment could  defend  the  ruble.  By  the  end  of  October  1995, 
the  ruble  had  stabilized  and  actually  appreciated  in  inflation- 
adjusted  terms.  It  remained  stable  during  the  first  half  of  1996. 
In  May  1996,  a  "crawling  band"  exchange  rate  was  introduced 
to  allow  the  ruble  to  depreciate  gradually  through  the  end  of 
1996,  beginning  between  5,000  and  5,600  per  US$1  and  end- 
ing between  5,500  and  6,100. 

Another  sign  of  currency  stabilization  was  the  announce- 
ment that  effective  June  1996,  the  ruble  would  become  fully 
convertible  on  a  current-account  basis.  This  meant  that  Rus- 
sian citizens  and  foreigners  would  be  able  to  convert  rubles  to 
other  currencies  for  trade  transactions. 

Privatization 

The  essence  of  economic  restructuring,  and  a  critical  consid- 
eration for  foreign  loans  and  investment  in  Russia's  economy,  is

the  privatization  program.  In  most  respects,  between  1992  and 
1995  Russia  kept  pace  with  or  exceeded  the  rate  established  in 
the  original  privatization  program  of  October  1991.  As  deputy 
prime  minister  for  economic  policy,  the  reformist  Chubays  was 
an  effective  advocate  of  privatization  during  its  important  early 
stages.  In  1992  privatization  of  small  enterprises  began  through 
employee  buyouts  and  public  auctions.  By  the  end  of  1993, 
more  than  85  percent  of  Russian  small  enterprises  and  more 
than  82,000  Russian  state  enterprises,  or  about  one-third  of  the 
total  in  existence,  had  been  privatized. 

On  October  1,  1992,  vouchers,  each  with  a  nominal  value  of 
10,000  rubles  (about  US$63),  were  distributed  to  144  million 
Russian  citizens  for  purchase  of  shares  in  medium-sized  and 
large  enterprises  that  officials  had  designated  and  reorganized 
for  this  type  of  privatization.  However,  voucher  holders  also 
could  sell  the  vouchers,  whose  cash  value  varied  according  to 
the  economic  and  political  conditions  in  the  country,  or  they 
could  invest  them  in  voucher  funds. 

By  the  end  of  June  1994,  the  voucher  privatization  program 
had  completed  its  first  phase.  It  succeeded  in  transferring  own- 
ership of  70  percent  of  Russia's  large  and  medium-sized  enter- 


315 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

prises  to  private  hands  and  in  privatizing  about  90  percent  of 
small  enterprises.  By  that  time,  96  percent  of  the  vouchers 
issued  in  1992  had  been  used  by  their  owners  to  buy  shares  in 
firms  directly,  invest  in  investment  funds,  or  sell  on  the  second- 
ary markets.  According  to  the  organizers  of  the  voucher  sys- 
tem, some  14,000  firms  employing  about  two-thirds  of  the 
industrial  labor  force  had  moved  into  private  hands. 

The  next  phase  of  the  privatization  program  called  for  direct 
cash  sales  of  shares  in  remaining  state  enterprises.  That  phase 
would  complete  the  transfer  of  state  enterprises  and  would  add 
to  government  revenues.  After  that  procedure  met  stiff  opposi- 
tion in  the  State  Duma,  Yeltsin  implemented  it  by  decree  in 
July  1994.  But  the  president's  commitment  to  privatization 
soon  came  into  question.  In  response  to  the  monetary  crisis  of 
October  1994,  Yeltsin  removed  Chubays  from  his  position  as 
head  of  the  State  Committee  for  the  Management  of  State 
Property,  replacing  him  with  little-known  official  Vladimir  Pole- 
vanov.  Polevanov  stunned  Russian  and  Western  privatization 
advocates  by  suggesting  renationalization  of  some  critical 
enterprises.  Yeltsin  reacted  by  replacing  Polevanov  with  Petr 
Mostovoy,  a  Chubays  ally.  In  the  ensuing  eighteen  months, 
Yeltsin  made  two  more  changes  in  the  chairmanship  position. 

In  1995  and  1996,  political  conditions  continued  to  hamper 
the  privatization  program,  and  corruption  scandals  tarnished 
the  program's  public  image.  By  1995  privatization  had  gained  a 
negative  reputation  with  ordinary  Russians,  who  coined  the 
slang  word  prikhvatizatsiya,  a  combination  of  the  Russian  word 
for  "grab"  and  the  Russianized  English  word  "privatize,"  pro- 
ducing the  equivalent  of  "grabification."  The  term  reflects  the 
belief  that  the  privatization  process  most  often  shifted  control 
of  enterprises  from  state  agencies  to  groups  of  individuals  with 
inside  connections  in  the  Government,  the  mafiya,  or  both.  Dis- 
trust of  the  privatization  process  was  part  of  an  increasing  pub- 
lic cynicism  about  the  country's  political  and  economic  leaders, 
fueled  by  the  seeming  failure  of  Yeltsin's  highly  touted  reform 
to  improve  the  lot  of  the  average  Russian  (see  Social  Stratifica- 
tion, ch.  5). 

The  second  phase  of  the  privatization  program  went  ahead 
with  the  sale  of  state-held  shares  for  cash.  Although  the  process 
was  virtually  complete  by  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  1996, 
the  Government  failed  to  garner  expected  revenues.  Mean- 
while, Yeltsin's  June  1996  bid  for  reelection  brought  a  virtual 
halt  in  privatization  of  state  enterprises  during  the  campaign 


316 


The  Economy 


period.  In  February  1996,  the  Procuracy  announced  a  full-scale 
investigation  into  privatization  practices,  in  particular  a  1995 
transaction  in  which  state  banks  awarded  loans  to  state  firms  in 
return  for  "privatization"  shares  in  those  enterprises  (see  The 
Procuracy,  ch.  10).  This  loans-for-shares  type  of  transaction 
characterized  the  second  phase  of  privatization;  banks  pro- 
vided the  government  badly  needed  cash  based  on  the  collat- 
eral of  enterprise  shares  that  banks  presumably  would  be  able 
to  sell  later.  But  most  of  the  twenty-nine  state  enterprises  origi- 
nally slated  to  participate  withdrew,  and  the  banks  that  received 
shares  appeared  to  have  a  conflict  of  interest  based  on  their 
role  in  setting  the  rules  of  the  bidding  procedure.  In  the  most 
widely  publicized  deal,  the  Uneximbank  of  Moscow  received  a 
38  percent  interest  in  the  giant  Noril'sk  Nickel  Joint-Stock 
Company  at  about  half  of  a  competing  bid.  Other  banks  and 
commercial  organizations  joined  the  traditional  opponents  of 
privatization  in  attacking  the  loans-for-shares  program,  and  in 
1996  the  Government  admitted  that  the  program  had  been 
handled  badly.  As  a  result  of  corruption  allegations,  the  State 
Duma  formed  a  committee  to  review  the  privatization  pro- 
gram. And  Prime  Minister  Chernomyrdin  requested  off-budget 
funds  to  buy  back  shares  from  the  banks. 

Because  the  faults  of  the  Yeltsin  privatization  program  were 
an  important  plank  in  the  1996  presidential  election  platform 
of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Russian  Federation  (Kommunis- 
ticheskaya  partiya  Rossiyskoy  Federatsii — KPRF),  the  strongest 
opposition  party,  Yeltsin's  campaign  strategy  was  to  reduce 
privatization  as  far  as  possible  as  a  campaign  issue  (see  The 
Executive  Branch,  ch.  7).  Part  of  that  strategy  was  to  shift  the 
privatization  process  from  Moscow  to  the  regions.  In  February 
1996,  a  presidential  decree  simply  granted  shares  in  about 
6,000  state-controlled  firms  to  regional  governments,  which 
could  auction  the  shares  and  keep  the  profits. 

After  Yeltsin's  reelection  in  July  1996,  his  financial  represen- 
tatives announced  continuation  of  the  privatization  program, 
with  a  new  focus  on  selling  ten  to  fifteen  large  state  enterprises, 
including  the  joint-stock  company  of  the  Unified  Electric 
Power  System  of  Russia  (YeES  Rossii),  the  Russian  State  Insur- 
ance Company  (Rosgosstrakh),  and  the  St.  Petersburg  Mari- 
time Port.  The  Communications  Investment  Joint-Stock 
Company  (Svyazinvest),  sale  of  which  had  failed  in  1995,  was  to 
be  offered  to  Western  telecommunications  companies  in  1996. 


317 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  new,  postelection  privatization  stage  also  was  to  reduce 
the  role  of  enterprise  workers  in  shareholding.  Within  the  first 
years  of  such  ownership,  most  worker  shares  had  been  sold  at 
depressed  prices,  devaluing  all  shares  and  cutting  state  profits 
from  enterprise  sales.  Therefore,  to  reach  the  budget  target  of 
12.4  trillion  rubles  (about  US$2.4  billion)  of  profit  from  priva- 
tization sales  in  1996,  distribution  was  to  target  recipients  who 
would  hold  shares  rather  than  sell  them  immediately. 

Despite  periodic  delays,  the  inept  administration  of  the  pro- 
gram's more  recent  phases,  and  allegations  of  favoritism  and 
corrupt  transactions  in  the  enterprise  and  financial  structures, 
in  1996  international  experts  judged  Russia's  privatization 
effort  a  qualified  success.  The  movement  of  capital  assets  from 
state  to  private  hands  has  progressed  without  serious  reversal  of 
direction — despite  periodic  calls  for  reestablishing  state  con- 
trol of  certain  assets.  And  the  process  has  contributed  to  the 
creation  of  a  new  class  of  private  entrepreneur. 

Economic  Conditions  in  Mid-1996 

As  of  mid-1996,  four  and  one-half  years  after  the  launching 
of  Russia's  post-Soviet  economic  reform,  experts  found  the 
results  promising  but  mixed.  The  Russian  economy  has  passed 
through  a  long  and  wrenching  depression.  Official  Russian 
economic  statistics  indicate  that  from  1990  to  the  end  of  1995, 
Russian  GDP  declined  by  roughly  50  percent,  far  greater  than 
the  decline  that  the  United  States  experienced  during  the 
Great  Depression.  (However,  alternative  estimates  by  Western 
analysts  described  a  much  less  severe  decline,  taking  into 
account  the  upward  bias  of  Soviet-era  economic  data  and  the 
downward  bias  of  post-Soviet  data.)  Such  a  decline,  however, 
was  to  be  expected  in  an  economy  going  through  the  transition 
from  central  planning  to  a  market  structure.  Much  of  the 
decline  in  production  has  occurred  in  the  military-industrial 
complex  and  other  heavy  industries  that  benefited  most  from 
the  skewed  economic  priorities  of  Soviet  planners  but  have 
much  less  robust  demand  in  a  freer  market. 

But  other  major  sectors  such  as  agriculture,  energy,  and  light 
industry  also  suffered  from  the  transition.  To  enable  these  sec- 
tors to  function  in  a  market  system,  inefficient  enterprises  had 
to  be  closed  and  workers  laid  off,  with  resulting  short-term 
declines  in  output  and  consumption.  Analysts  had  expected 
that  Russia's  GDP  would  begin  to  rise  in  1996,  but  data  for  the 
first  six  months  of  the  year  showed  a  continuing  decline,  and

some  Russian  experts  predicted  a  new  phase  of  economic  crisis 
in  the  second  half  of  the  year. 

The  pain  of  the  restructuring  has  been  assuaged  somewhat 
by  the  emergence  of  a  new  private  sector.  Western  experts 
believe  that  Russian  data  overstate  the  dimensions  of  Russia's 
economic  collapse  by  failing  to  reflect  a  large  portion  of  the 
country's  private-sector  activity.  The  Russian  services  sector, 
especially  retail  sales,  is  playing  an  increasingly  vital  role  in  the 
economy,  accounting  for  nearly  half  of  GDP  in  1995.  The  ser- 
vices sector's  activities  have  not  been  adequately  measured. 
Data  on  sector  performance  are  skewed  by  the  underreporting 
or  nonreporting  of  output  that  Russia's  tax  laws  encourage. 
According  to  Western  analysts,  by  the  end  of  1995  more  than 
half  of  GDP  and  more  than  60  percent  of  the  labor  force  were 
based  in  the  private  sector. 

An  important  but  unconventional  service  in  Russia's  econ- 
omy is  "shuttle  trading" — the  transport  and  sale  of  consumer 
goods  by  individual  entrepreneurs,  of  whom  5  to  10  million 
were  estimated  to  be  active  in  1996.  Traders  buy  goods  in  for- 
eign countries  such  as  China,  Turkey,  and  the  United  Arab 
Emirates  and  in  Russian  cities,  then  sell  them  on  the  domestic 
market  where  demand  is  highest.  Yevgeniy  Yasin,  minister  of 
economics,  estimated  that  in  1995  some  US$11  billion  worth  of 


319 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

goods  entered  Russia  in  this  way.  Shuttle  traders  have  been  vital 
in  maintaining  the  standard  of  living  of  Russians  who  cannot 
afford  consumer  goods  on  the  conventional  market.  However, 
domestic  industries  such  as  textiles  suffer  from  this  infusion  of 
competing  merchandise,  whose  movement  is  unmonitored, 
untaxed,  and  often  ?na/z)>a-controlled. 

The  geographical  distribution  of  Russia's  wealth  has  been 
skewed  at  least  as  severely  as  it  was  in  Soviet  times.  By  the  mid- 
1990s,  economic  power  was  being  concentrated  in  Moscow  at 
an  even  faster  rate  than  the  federal  government  was  losing 
political  power  in  the  rest  of  the  country.  In  Moscow  an  eco- 
nomic oligarchy,  composed  of  politicians,  banks,  businesspeo- 
ple,  security  forces,  and  city  agencies,  controlled  a  huge 
percentage  of  Russia's  financial  assets  under  the  rule  of  Mos- 
cow's energetic  and  popular  mayor,  Yuriy  Luzhkov.  Unfortu- 
nately, organized  crime  also  has  played  a  strong  role  in  the 
growth  of  the  city  (see  The  Crime  Wave  of  the  1990s,  ch.  10). 
Opposed  by  a  weak  police  force,  Moscow's  rate  of  protection 
rackets,  contract  murders,  kickbacks,  and  bribes — all  intimately 
connected  with  the  economic  infrastructure — has  remained 
among  the  highest  in  Russia.  Most  businesses  have  not  been 
able  to  function  without  paying  for  some  form  of  mafiya  protec- 
tion, informally  called  a  krysha  (the  Russian  word  for  roof). 

Luzhkov,  who  has  close  ties  to  all  legitimate  power  centers  in 
the  city,  has  overseen  the  construction  of  sports  stadiums,  shop- 
ping malls,  monuments  to  Moscow's  history,  and  the  ornate 
Christ  the  Savior  Cathedral.  In  1994  Yeltsin  gave  Luzhkov  full 
control  over  all  state  property  in  Moscow.  In  the  first  half  of 
1996,  the  city  privatized  state  enterprises  at  the  rate  of  US$1  bil- 
lion per  year,  a  faster  rate  than  the  entire  national  privatization 
process  in  the  same  period.  Under  Luzhkov's  leadership,  the 
city  government  also  acquired  full  or  major  interests  in  a  wide 
variety  of  enterprises — from  banking,  hotels,  and  construction 
to  bakeries  and  beauty  salons.  Such  ownership  has  allowed 
Luzhkov's  planners  to  manipulate  resources  efficiently  and 
with  little  or  no  competition.  Meanwhile,  Moscow  also  became 
the  center  of  foreign  investment  in  Russia,  often  to  the  exclu- 
sion of  other  regions.  For  example,  the  McDonald's  fast-food 
chain,  which  began  operations  in  Moscow  in  1990,  enjoyed 
immediate  success  but  expanded  only  in  Moscow.  The  concen- 
tration of  Russia's  banking  industry  in  Moscow  gave  the  city  a 
huge  advantage  in  competing  for  foreign  commercial  activity.

The  Economy 


In  mid-1996  the  national  government  appeared  to  have 
achieved  some  degree  of  macroeconomic  stability.  However, 
longer-term  stability  depends  on  the  ability  of  policy  makers  to 
withstand  the  inflationary  pressures  of  demands  for  state  subsi- 
dies and  easier  credits  for  failing  enterprises  and  other  special 
interests.  (Chubays  estimated  that  spending  promises  made 
during  Yeltsin's  campaign  amounted  to  US$250  per  voter, 
which  if  actually  spent  would  approximately  double  the 
national  budget  deficit;  most  of  Yeltsin's  pledges  seemingly 
were  forgotten  shortly  after  his  reelection.) 

By  1996  the  structure  of  Russian  economic  output  had 
shifted  far  enough  that  it  more  closely  resembled  that  of  a 
developed  market  economy  than  the  distorted  Soviet  central- 
planning  model.  With  the  decline  in  demand  for  defense 
industry  goods,  overall  production  has  shifted  from  heavy 
industry  to  consumer  production  (see  The  Defense  Industry, 
ch.  9).  However,  in  the  mid-1990s  the  low  quality  of  most 
domestically  produced  consumer  goods  continued  to  limit 
enterprises'  profits  and  therefore  their  ability  to  modernize 
production  operations.  On  the  other  side  of  the  "vicious  cir- 
cle," reliance  on  an  outmoded  production  system  guaranteed 
that  product  quality  would  remain  low  and  uncompetitive. 

Most  prices  are  left  to  the  market,  although  local  and 
regional  governments  control  the  prices  of  some  staples. 
Energy  prices  remain  controlled,  but  the  Government  has 
been  shifting  these  prices  upward  to  close  the  gap  with  world 
market  prices. 

Natural  Resources 

Russia  is  the  largest  country  in  the  world;  it  covers  a  vast 
amount  of  topographically  varied  territory,  including  much 
that  is  inaccessible  by  conventional  modes  of  transportation. 
The  traditional  centers  of  economic  activity  are  almost  exclu- 
sively located  in  the  more  hospitable  European  part  of  Russia, 
which  once  offered  considerable  coal  and  natural  gas  to  drive 
heavy  industry  (see  fig.  7).  But  the  European  fuel  base  was 
largely  depleted  by  the  1980s,  forcing  Russia  to  rely  on  Siberian 
deposits  much  farther  from  the  industrial  heartland. 

Russia  is  one  of  the  world's  richest  countries  in  raw  materi- 
als, many  of  which  are  significant  inputs  for  an  industrial  econ- 
omy. Russia  accounts  for  around  20  percent  of  the  world's 
production  of  oil  and  natural  gas  and  possesses  large  reserves 
of  both  fuels.  This  abundance  has  made  Russia  virtually  self-suf- 


321

The  Economy 


ficient  in  energy  and  a  large-scale  exporter  of  fuels.  Oil  and  gas 
were  primary  hard-currency  earners  for  the  Soviet  Union,  and 
they  remain  so  for  the  Russian  Federation.  Russia  also  is  self- 
sufficient  in  nearly  all  major  industrial  raw  materials  and  has  at 
least  some  reserves  of  every  industrially  valuable  nonfuel  min- 
eral— even  after  the  productive  mines  of  Ukraine,  Kazakstan, 
and  Uzbekistan  no  longer  were  directly  accessible.  Tin,  tung- 
sten, bauxite,  and  mercury  were  among  the  few  natural  materi- 
als imported  in  the  Soviet  period.  Russia  possesses  rich  reserves 
of  iron  ore,  manganese,  chromium,  nickel,  platinum,  titanium, 
copper,  tin,  lead,  tungsten,  diamonds,  phosphates,  and  gold, 
and  the  forests  of  Siberia  contain  an  estimated  one-fifth  of  the 
world's  timber,  mainly  conifers  (see  fig.  8;  Environmental  Con- 
ditions, ch.  3). 

The  iron  ore  deposits  of  the  Kursk  Magnetic  Anomaly,  close 
to  the  Ukrainian  border  in  the  southwest,  are  believed  to  con- 
tain one-sixth  of  the  world's  total  reserves.  Intensive  exploita- 
tion began  there  in  the  1950s.  Other  large  iron  ore  deposits  are 
located  in  the  Kola  Peninsula,  Karelia,  south-central  Siberia, 
and  the  Far  East.  The  largest  copper  deposits  are  located  in  the 
Kola  Peninsula  and  the  Urals,  and  lead  and  zinc  are  found  in 
North  Ossetia. 

Agriculture 

Climatic  and  geographic  factors  limit  Russia's  agricultural 
activity  to  about  10  percent  of  the  country's  total  land  area.  Of 
that  amount,  about  60  percent  is  used  for  crops,  the  remainder 
for  pasture  and  meadow  (see  table  15,  Appendix).  In  the  Euro- 
pean part  of  Russia,  the  most  productive  land  is  in  the  Central 
Chernozem  Economic  Region  and  the  Volga  Economic 
Region,  which  occupy  the  grasslands  between  Ukraine  and 
Kazakstan.  More  than  65  percent  of  the  land  in  those  regions  is 
devoted  to  agriculture.  In  Siberia  and  the  Far  East,  the  most 
productive  areas  are  the  southernmost  regions.  Fodder  crops 
dominate  in  the  colder  regions,  and  intensity  of  cultivation 
generally  is  higher  in  European  Russia.  The  last  expansion  of 
cultivated  land  occurred  in  the  late  1950s  and  early  1960s, 
when  the  Virgin  Lands  program  of  Nikita  Khrushchev  opened 
land  in  southwestern  Siberia  (and  neighboring  Kazakstan)  for 
cultivation.  In  the  mid-1990s,  about  15  percent  of  the  working 
population  was  occupied  in  agriculture,  with  the  proportion 
dropping  slowly  as  the  younger  population  left  rural  areas  to 
seek  economic  opportunities  elsewhere  (see  Rural  Life,  ch.  5).

The  Economy 


Crops 

Grains  are  among  Russia's  most  important  crops,  occupying 
more  than  50  percent  of  cropland.  Wheat  is  dominant  in  most 
grain-producing  areas.  Winter  wheat  is  cultivated  in  the  North 
Caucasus  and  spring  wheat  in  the  Don  Basin,  in  the  middle 
Volga  region,  and  in  southwestern  Siberia.  Although  Khru- 
shchev expanded  the  cultivation  of  corn  for  livestock  feed,  that 
crop  is  only  suitable  for  growth  in  the  North  Caucasus,  and  pro- 
duction levels  have  remained  low  compared  with  other  grains. 
Barley,  second  to  wheat  in  gross  yield,  is  grown  mainly  for  ani- 
mal feed  and  beer  production  in  colder  regions  as  far  north  as 
65°  north  latitude  (the  latitude  of  Arkhangelsk)  and  well  into 
the  highlands  of  southern  Siberia.  Production  of  oats,  which 
once  ranked  third  among  Russia's  grains,  has  declined  as 
machines  have  replaced  horses  in  farming  operations. 

Legumes  became  a  common  crop  in  state  farms  in  the 
1980s.  Potatoes,  a  vital  crop  for  food  and  for  the  production  of 
vodka,  are  grown  in  colder  regions  between  50°  and  60°  north 
latitude.  Sugar  beet  production  has  expanded  in  recent  years; 
the  beets  are  grown  mainly  in  the  rich  black-earth  districts  of 
European  Russia.  Flax,  also  a  plant  tolerant  of  cold  and  poor 
soils,  is  Russia's  most  important  raw  material  for  textiles,  and 
the  country  produced  about  half  the  world's  flax  crop  in  the 
1980s.  Flax  also  yields  linseed  oil,  which  together  with  sunflow- 
ers (in  the  North  Caucasus)  and  soybeans  (in  the  Far  East)  is 
an  important  source  of  vegetable  oil.  Production  of  fruits  and 
vegetables  increased  as  private  farms  began  to  expand  around 
1990.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  largest  yields  in  that  category  were 
in  cabbages,  apples,  tomatoes,  and  carrots. 

Increased  production  of  fodder  crops  and  expansion  of  pas- 
tureland  have  supported  Russia's  livestock  industry,  although 
economic  conditions  have  caused  cutbacks  in  animal  holdings. 
Cattle  are  the  most  common  form  of  livestock  except  in  the 
drier  areas,  where  sheep  and  goats  dominate.  The  third-largest 
category  is  pigs,  which  are  raised  in  areas  of  European  Russia 
and  the  Pacific  coast  that  offer  grain,  potatoes,  or  sugar  beets 
as  fodder.  Only  very  small  numbers  of  chickens  are  kept,  and 
frozen  chicken  has  become  one  of  Russia's  largest  import 
items. 

Agricultural  Policy 

Agricultural  reform  has  proved  to  be  a  tough  challenge  for 


325 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russia  during  its  transition  to  a  market  economy.  The  chal- 
lenge comes  from  the  legacy  of  the  Soviet  period  and  from 
deeply  imbedded  cultural  biases  against  individualism.  Because 
of  agriculture's  vital  economic  role,  large-scale  agricultural 
reform  is  necessary  for  success  in  other  sectors.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  however,  private  initiative  was  not  rewarded,  and  ineffi- 
cient input  distribution  and  marketing  structures  failed  to  take 
advantage  of  agricultural  assets. 

Soviet  Policy 

Under  Stalin  the  government  socialized  agriculture  and  cre- 
ated a  massive  bureaucracy  to  administer  policy.  Stalin's  cam- 
paign of  forced  collectivization,  which  began  in  1929, 
confiscated  the  land,  machinery,  livestock,  and  grain  stores  of 
the  peasantry.  By  1937  the  government  had  organized  approxi- 
mately 99  percent  of  the  Soviet  countryside  into  state-run  col- 
lective farms.  Under  this  grossly  inefficient  system,  agricultural 
yields  declined  rather  than  increased.  The  situation  persisted 
into  the  1980s,  when  Soviet  farmers  averaged  about  10  percent 
of  the  output  of  their  counterparts  in  the  United  States. 

During  Stalin's  regime,  the  government  assigned  virtually  all 
farmland  to  one  of  two  basic  agricultural  production  organiza- 
tions— state  farms  and  collective  farms.  The  state  farm  was  con- 
ceived in  1918  as  the  ideal  model  for  socialist  agriculture.  It  was 
to  be  a  large,  modern  enterprise  directed  and  financed  by  the 
government.  The  work  force  of  the  state  farm  received  wages 
and  social  benefits  comparable  to  those  enjoyed  by  industrial 
workers.  By  contrast,  the  collective  farm  was  a  self-financed 
producer  cooperative  that  farmed  parcels  of  land  that  the  state 
granted  to  it  rent-free  and  that  paid  its  members  according  to 
their  contribution  of  work. 

In  their  early  stages,  the  two  types  of  organization  also  func- 
tioned differently  in  the  distribution  of  agricultural  goods. 
State  farms  delivered  their  entire  output  to  state  procurement 
agencies  in  response  to  state  production  quotas.  Collective 
farms  also  received  quotas,  but  they  were  free  to  sell  excess  out- 
put in  collective-farm  markets  where  prices  were  determined 
by  supply  and  demand.  The  distinction  between  the  two  types 
of  farms  gradually  narrowed,  and  the  government  converted 
many  collective  farms  to  state  farms,  where  the  state  had  more 
control. 

Private  plots  also  played  a  role  in  the  Soviet  agricultural  sys- 
tem. The  government  allotted  small  plots  to  individual  farming 


326 


The  Economy 


households  to  produce  food  for  their  own  use  and  for  sale  as 
an  income  supplement.  Throughout  the  Soviet  period,  the 
productivity  rates  of  private  plots  far  exceeded  their  size.  With 
only  3  percent  of  total  sown  area  in  the  1980s,  they  produced 
over  a  quarter  of  agricultural  output. 

A  number  of  factors  made  the  Soviet  collectivized  system 
inefficient  throughout  its  history.  Because  farmers  were  paid 
the  same  wages  regardless  of  productivity,  there  was  no  incen- 
tive to  work  harder  and  more  efficiently.  Administrators  who 
were  unaware  of  the  needs  and  capabilities  of  the  individual 
farms  decided  input  allocation  and  output  levels,  and  the  high 
degree  of  subsidization  eliminated  incentives  to  adopt  more 
efficient  production  methods. 

The  Gorbachev  Reforms 

The  Gorbachev  agricultural  reform  program  aimed  to 
improve  production  incentives.  Gorbachev  sought  to  increase 
agricultural  labor  productivity  by  forming  contract  brigades 
consisting  of  ten  to  thirty  farmworkers  who  managed  a  piece  of 
land  leased  from  a  state  or  collective  farm.  The  brigades  were 
responsible  for  the  yield  of  the  land,  which  in  turn  determined 
their  remuneration.  After  1987  the  government  legalized  fam- 
ily contract  brigades  and  long-term  leasing  of  land,  removing 
the  restrictions  on  the  size  of  private  agricultural  plots  and  cut- 
ting into  the  state's  holdings  of  arable  land. 

Although  Gorbachev's  reforms  increased  output  in  the  agri- 
cultural sector  in  1986,  they  failed  to  address  fundamental 
problems  of  the  system,  such  as  the  government's  continued 
control  over  the  prices  of  agricultural  commodities,  the  distri- 
bution of  agricultural  inputs,  and  production  and  investment 
decisions.  In  the  contract  brigade  system,  farmers  still  had  no 
real  vested  interest  in  the  farms  on  which  they  worked,  and 
production  suffered  accordingly.  In  the  1980s,  the  Soviet 
Union  went  from  being  self-sufficient  in  food  production  to 
becoming  a  net  food  importer. 

Yeltsin 's  Agricultural  Policies 

The  Yeltsin  regime  has  attempted  to  address  some  of  the 
fundamental  reform  issues  of  Russian  agriculture.  But  agricul- 
tural reform  has  moved  very  slowly,  causing  output  to  decline 
steadily  through  the  mid-1990s.  Reform  began  in  Russia  shortly 
before  the  final  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  In  December 
1990,  the  Congress  of  People's  Deputies  of  the  Russian  Repub- 


327 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

lie  enacted  a  number  of  laws  that  were  designed  to  restructure 
the  agricultural  sector  and  make  it  more  commercially  viable. 
The  Law  on  Peasant  Farms  legalized  private  farms  and  allowed 
them  to  operate  alongside  state  and  collective  farms,  to  hire 
labor,  and  to  sell  produce  without  state  supervision.  The  same 
session  of  the  congress  passed  the  Law  on  Land  Reform,  which 
permitted  land  to  be  bequeathed  as  an  inheritance  from  one 
generation  to  the  next,  but  not  to  be  bought  or  sold.  The  gov- 
ernment also  established  the  State  Committee  for  Agrarian 
Reform,  whose  responsibility  was  to  oversee  the  transfer  of 
available  land  to  private  farming. 

The  main  thrust  of  Yeltsin's  agricultural  reform  has  been 
toward  reorganizing  state  and  collective  farms  into  more  effi- 
cient, market-oriented  units.  A  decree  of  December  1991  and 
its  subsequent  amendments  provided  several  options  to  state 
and  collective  farmers  for  the  future  structure  of  their  farms. 
The  decree  required  that  farmers  choose  either  to  reorganize 
into  joint-stock  companies,  cooperatives,  or  individual  private 
farms,  or  to  maintain  their  existing  structure.  Under  the  first 
two  arrangements,  workers  would  hold  shares  in  the  farms  and 
be  responsible  for  managing  the  enterprises.  An  individual 
farmer  could  later  decide  to  break  from  the  larger  unit  and 
establish  private  ownership  of  his  or  her  share  of  the  land,  as 
determined  by  an  established  procedure. 

This  restructuring  program  has  progressed  slowly.  Although 
95  percent  of  the  state  and  collective  farms  underwent  some 
form  of  reorganization,  about  one-third  of  them  retained 
essentially  their  earlier  structure.  Most  of  the  others,  fearing 
the  unstable  conditions  of  market  supply  and  demand  that 
faced  individual  entrepreneurs,  chose  a  form  of  collective  own- 
ership, either  as  joint-stock  companies  or  as  cooperatives.  The 
conservatism  of  Russia's  farmers  prompted  them  to  preserve  as 
much  as  possible  of  the  inefficient  but  secure  Soviet-era  con- 
trolled relationships  of  supply  and  output. 

As  of  1996,  individual  private  farming  had  not  assumed  the 
significance  in  Russian  agriculture  that  reformers  and  Western 
supporters  had  envisioned.  Although  the  number  of  private 
farms  increased  considerably  following  the  reforms  of  1990,  by 
the  early  1990s  the  growth  of  farms  had  stalled,  and  by  the  mid- 
1990s  the  number  of  private  farms  actually  may  have  dropped 
as  some  individuals  opted  to  return  to  a  form  of  cooperative 
enterprise  or  left  farming  entirely.  By  the  end  of  1995,  Russia's

280,000  private  farms  accounted  for  only  5  percent  of  the  ara- 
ble land  in  Russia. 

A  number  of  factors  have  contributed  to  the  slow  progress  of 
agricultural  reform.  Until  the  mid-1990s,  the  state  government 
continued  to  act  as  the  chief  marketing  agent  for  the  food  sec- 
tor by  establishing  fixed  orders  for  goods,  thus  guaranteeing 
farmers  a  market.  The  government  also  subsidized  farms 
through  guaranteed  prices,  which  reduced  the  incentive  of 
farmers  to  become  efficient  producers. 

Perhaps  most  important,  effective  land  reform  has  not  been 
accomplished  in  Russia.  The  original  land  reform  law  and  sub- 
sequent decrees  did  not  provide  a  clear  definition  of  private 
property,  and  they  did  not  prescribe  landholders'  rights  and 
protections.  The  nebulous  status  of  private  landholders  under 
the  new  legislation  made  farmers  reluctant  to  take  the  risk  of 


329

proprietorship.  In  March  1996,  President  Yeltsin  issued  a 
decree  that  allows  farmers  to  buy  and  sell  land.  However,  in 
April  1996  the  State  Duma,  heavily  influenced  by  the  an  tire- 
form  KPRF  and  its  ally,  the  Agrarian  Party  of  Russia  (represent- 
ing the  still  formidable  vested  interests  of  collective  and  state 
farms),  passed  a  draft  law  that  prohibits  land  sales  by  anyone 
but  the  state.  Recent  opposition  to  the  new  notion  of  private 
landownership  is  based  in  a  strong  traditional  Russian  view  that 
land  must  be  held  as  collective  rather  than  individual  property. 

However,  in  1996  several  factors  were  exerting  pressure  on 
the  agricultural  sector  to  become  commercially  viable.  The  fed- 
eral government  has  retreated  from  its  role  as  a  guaranteed 
purchaser  and  marketer,  although  some  regional  governments 
are  stepping  in  to  fill  the  role.  And  private  markets  are  emerg- 
ing slowly.  Increasingly,  Russian  agricultural  production  must 
compete  with  imported  goods  as  the  gap  between  domestic 
prices  and  world  prices  narrows.  In  addition,  the  fiscal  position 
of  the  federal  government  has  forced  it  to  reduce  subsidies  to 
many  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  agriculture.  Subsidies 
are  among  the  targets  of  major  budget  cuts  to  comply  with  the 
standards  of  the  IMF  and  other  Western  lenders  and  achieve 
macroeconomic  stabilization. 

Agricultural  Production 

Like  the  rest  of  the  economy,  the  Russian  agricultural  sector 
has  experienced  a  long,  severe  recession  in  the  1990s.  Even 
before  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  output  of  grains 
and  other  crops  began  to  decline,  and  it  decreased  steadily 
through  1996  because  of  the  unavailability  of  fertilizers  and 
other  inputs,  bad  weather,  and  major  readjustments  during  the 
period  of  transition.  In  1995  overall  agricultural  production 
declined  8  percent,  including  a  drop  of  5  percent  in  crop  pro- 
duction and  11  percent  in  livestock  production.  That  year  Rus- 
sia suffered  its  worst  grain  harvest  since  1963,  with  a  yield  of 
63.5  million  tons. 

The  most  dramatic  declines  occurred  in  livestock  produc- 
tion. Farmers  reduced  their  holdings  of  animals  as  the  price  of 
grains  and  other  inputs  increased.  As  meat  prices  rose,  the 
composition  of  the  average  consumer's  diet  included  less  meat 
and  more  starches  and  vegetables.  Reduced  demand  in  turn 
exacerbated  the  decline  in  livestock  production.

The  Economy 


Energy 

Energy  plays  a  central  role  in  the  Russian  economy  because 
it  drives  all  the  other  elements  of  the  system — the  industrial, 
agricultural,  commercial,  and  government  sectors.  In  addition, 
energy,  particularly  petroleum  and  natural  gas,  is  the  most 
important  export  and  source  of  foreign  exchange  for  the  Rus- 
sian economy.  Experts  forecast  that  the  energy  sector  will  con- 
tinue to  occupy  this  central  position  until  Russian 
manufacturing  reaches  a  level  competitive  with  the  West. 

Exploitation  and  Consumption 

Russia's  self-sufficiency  in  fuels  and  power  generation  puts 
the  country  in  a  good  position  for  future  economic  growth  and 
development.  But  Russia  is  also  one  of  the  most  energy-depen- 
dent countries.  The  International  Energy  Agency  of  the  Organ- 
isation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development 
(OECD — see  Glossary)  estimated  that  in  1993  it  took  4.46  tons 
of  oil  equivalent  (TOE)  to  produce  US$1,000  of  Russia's  GDP, 
compared  with  an  average  of  0.23  TOE  to  produce  US$1,000  of 
GDP  for  the  OECD  member  countries. 

Russia's  excessive  consumption  of  energy  results  from  the 
Soviet  system,  which  artificially  priced  energy  far  below  the 
level  of  world  market  prices  and  thus  subsidized  it.  Soviet 
energy-pricing  policies  disregarded  resource  utilization  in  the 
quest  for  higher  output  volumes  and  discouraged  the  adoption 
of  conservation  measures.  Soviet  planners  also  skewed 
resources  toward  the  defense-related  and  heavy  industries, 
which  consume  energy  more  intensively  than  other  sectors  of 
the  economy.  Until  the  1980s,  the  national  economy  managed 
to  survive  under  such  policies  because  of  the  Soviet  Union's 
rich  endowment  of  natural  resources. 

The  problems  that  plagued  the  Russian  energy  sector  in  the 
last  decades  of  the  Soviet  Union  were  exacerbated  during  the 
transition  period.  Since  1991  the  output  of  all  types  of  fuel  and 
energy  has  declined,  partly  because  of  plummeting  demand  for 
energy  during  a  time  of  general  economic  contraction.  But  the 
energy  sectors  also  have  suffered  from  the  intrinsic  structural 
defects  of  the  central  planning  system:  poor  management  of 
resources,  underinvestment,  and  outdated  technology  and 
equipment. 

The  structure  of  energy  and  fuel  production  began  to 
change  dramatically  in  the  1980s  with  the  exploitation  of  large 


331 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


natural  gas  deposits.  In  the  mid-1990s,  natural  gas  accounted 
for  more  than  half  of  Russia's  energy  consumption,  a  share  that 
is  expected  to  increase  in  the  next  decades.  Oil  accounts  for 
another  20  percent,  a  proportion  that  is  expected  to  remain 
approximately  constant.  Goal  and  other  solid  fuels,  water 
power,  and  nuclear  energy  account  for  smaller  shares  that 
experts  predict  likely  will  decline  after  2000.  Despite  the  waste 
of  fuel  in  the  Russian  economy,  Russia  manages  to  produce  a 
surplus  of  energy  for  export.  Exports,  particularly  of  natural 
gas  and  oil,  have  accounted  for  30  percent  of  Russian  energy 
production,  and  this  share  is  expected  to  hold  steady. 

Russia's  drive  to  become  a  market  economy  should  help  to 
alleviate  some  of  the  problems  of  the  energy  sector.  Russian 
energy  pricing  policies  have  changed.  Since  January  1992, 
energy  has  been  gradually  deregulated,  closing  the  gap 
between  world  market  prices  and  domestic  prices  and  forcing 
consumers  to  conserve.  Russia  is  also  adopting  Western  tech- 
nology and  more  efficient  management  techniques  that  will 
improve  productivity  in  the  sector. 

Oil 

Russia  ranks  third  in  the  world  in  oil  production,  after  Saudi 
Arabia  and  the  United  States.  Estimates  place  proven  and 
potential  oil  reserves  at  8  to  11  billion  tons.  Russia's  oil  produc- 
tion peaked  in  1987,  then  began  a  decline  that  continued 
through  1995.  In  the  latter  year,  the  yield  was  741  million  bar- 
rels, 13  million  barrels  less  than  the  previous  year.  Output  for 
the  first  quarter  of  1996  was  182  million  barrels. 

Wasteful  Soviet  oil  exploration  and  extraction  techniques 
depleted  wells,  which  often  fell  far  below  their  potential  capac- 
ity. Soviet  technology  was  not  capable  of  exploring  and  extract- 
ing as  deeply  and  efficiently  as  Western  technology.  These 
handicaps  have  been  instrumental  in  Russia's  plummeting  oil 
production  during  the  last  two  decades.  In  1994  the  number  of 
oil  wells  drilled  was  only  one-quarter  the  number  drilled  in 
1983.  About  two-thirds  of  Russia's  oil  comes  from  Siberia, 
mostly  from  huge  fields  in  the  northwest  part  of  the  region. 
The  main  European  oil  and  gas  fields  are  located  in  the  Volga- 
Ural  region,  the  North  Caucasus,  and  the  far  north  of  the 
Republic  of  Komi  (see  fig.  9). 

Russian  oil  companies  are  vertically  integrated  units  that 
control  the  entire  production  process  from  exploration  to 
transmission.  The  largest  company  is  Lukoil,  which,  according 


332 


19 


The  Economy 


to  some  measurements,  is  the  largest  oil  company  in  the  world. 
The  dominance  of  a  few  large  companies  has  made  all  stages  of 
petroleum  exploitation  and  sale  extremely  inefficient.  National 
and  local  government  policies  have  discouraged  individual 
retailers  from  establishing  independent  gasoline  storage  facili- 
ties and  stations;  therefore,  retail  gasoline  likely  will  continue 
to  be  in  very  short  supply  (only  8,900  stations  were  operating  in 
Russia  in  1995).  Until  January  1995,  government  policy 
applied  quotas  to  oil  exports,  and  until  July  1996  tariffs  were 
applied  to  oil  exports.  Both  policies,  resulting  from  the  gap 
between  controlled  domestic  prices  and  world  market  prices, 
aimed  at  ensuring  a  sufficient  supply  of  oil  to  meet  domestic 
demand;  both  were  lifted  as  the  gap  narrowed. 

The  search  for  new  oil  deposits  has  been  a  primary  force  in 
Russia's  foreign  policy  toward  states  to  the  south.  Russia  has 
staked  its  claim  to  the  Caspian  oil  reserves  that  Western  compa- 
nies are  exploring  in  conjunction  with  Azerbaijani,  Turkmeni- 
stani,  and  Kazakstani  state  companies.  The  presence  of 
Western  interests  and  the  strong  role  being  played  by  Iran  and 
Turkey,  Russia's  traditional  regional  rivals,  have  complicated 
this  policy,  which  aims  to  achieve  maximum  benefit  from  Rus- 
sia's position  on  the  shore  of  the  north  Caspian.  Also  a  source 
of  international  controversy  is  Russia's  insistence  that  Caspian 
oil  flow  northward  through  Russian  pipelines  rather  than  west- 
ward via  new  lines  built  through  Georgia  and  Turkey  (see  For- 
eign Investment  in  Oil  and  Gas,  this  ch.). 

Natural  Gas 

Russia  is  also  one  of  the  world's  largest  natural  gas  produc- 
ers. Its  proven  reserves  have  been  estimated  at  49  billion  cubic 
meters,  or  roughly  35  percent  of  the  world's  total.  Natural  gas 
has  also  been  one  of  the  most  successful  parts  of  the  Russian 
economy.  In  the  early  1980s,  it  replaced  oil  as  the  Soviet 
"growth  fuel,"  offering  cheaper  extraction  and  transportation. 
Although  output  has  dropped  in  the  1990s,  the  decline  has  not 
been  as  severe  as  that  for  other  energy  sources  or  the  rest  of  the 
economy.  Natural  gas  production  peaked  in  1991  at  727  mil- 
lion cubic  meters,  then  dropped  throughout  the  early  1990s. 
But  1995  production,  596  million  cubic  meters,  was  an  increase 
from  the  previous  year.  After  European  gas  fields  in  the  Volga- 
Ural  region  dominated  the  industry  through  the  1970s,  pro- 
duction shifted  to  giant  fields  in  Siberia.  The  Urengoy  and 
Yamburg  fields  in  the  West  Siberia  region  are  among  the  most

Natural  Gas 

Russia  is  also  one  of  the  world's  largest  natural  gas  produc- 
ers. Its  proven  reserves  have  been  estimated  at  49  billion  cubic 
meters,  or  roughly  35  percent  of  the  world's  total.  Natural  gas 
has  also  been  one  of  the  most  successful  parts  of  the  Russian

duction shifted  to  giant  fields  in  Siberia.  The  Urengoy  and 
Yamburg  fields  in  the  West  Siberia  region  are  among  the  most 


335

productive;  the  former  is  the  largest  field  in  the  world.  Soviet 
plans  called  for  rapid  development  of  new  reserves  in  the 
Yamal  Peninsula  in  the  Arctic  Ocean  north  of  Urengoy,  but 
environmental  problems  and  infrastructure  costs  slowed  devel- 
opment. Hasty  construction  and  poor  maintenance  have 
caused  chronic  breakdowns  and  accidents  in  the  long  pipelines 
of  Russia's  natural  gas  delivery  system  (see  Transportation,  this 
ch.). 

The  State  Natural  Gas  Company  (Gazprom)  has  a  virtual 
monopoly  over  Russia's  gas  production  and  transmission.  A  ver- 
tically organized  enterprise,  the  company  has  been  reorga- 
nized into  a  joint-stock  company,  in  which  40  percent  of  the 
shares  remain  under  state  control.  Company  employees  hold 
another  15  percent,  managers  of  the  company  hold  10  percent, 
and  the  remaining  35  percent  were  sold  at  public  auction.  Gaz- 
prom controls  a  network  of  regional  production  associations. 
Its  management,  which  once  was  headed  by  Prime  Minister 
Viktor  Chernomyrdin,  has  been  accused  of  corruption  and  tax 
evasion. 

Coal 

For  more  than  150  years,  coal  was  the  dominant  fuel  sup- 
porting Russia's  industries,  and  many  industrial  centers  were 
located  near  coal  deposits.  In  the  1960s,  oil  and  natural  gas 
overtook  coal  when  plentiful  reserves  of  those  fuels  became 
available  and  the  coal  shafts  of  the  European  Soviet  Union 
(located  primarily  in  what  is  today  Ukraine)  were  being 
exhausted.  Russian  coal  reserves  are  estimated  at  200  billion 
tons,  an  amount  that  experts  say  is  more  than  ample  for  cur- 
rent usage  trends.  Siberia  and  the  Far  East  produce  about 
three-quarters  of  Russia's  coal,  with  the  European  contribu- 
tions coming  largely  from  the  Vorkuta  field  (Pechora  Basin)  in 
Komi,  the  Urals,  the  eastern  Donets  Basin  in  the  southwest, 
and  the  Moscow  Basin.  Largely  untapped  coal  fields  lie  in  the 
Siberian  Tunguska  and  Lena  basins.  Productive  fields  in  Sibe- 
ria are  located  along  the  Trans-Siberian  Railroad,  making  their 
exploitation  more  economical.  The  largest  operational  sources 
in  that  region  are  the  Kuznetsk,  Kansk-Achinsk,  and  Che- 
remkhovo  fields.  Coal  is  one  of  the  less  important  sources  of 
energy  because  its  labor-intensive  extraction  makes  production 
much  more  costly  than  other  fuels.  Rossugol',  the  Russian  coal 
company,  controls  coal  production  through  regional  associa- 
tions that  are  organized  as  joint-stock  companies.  Russian  coal 


336 


The  Economy 


production  has  declined  markedly  over  the  last  decade,  and 
the  coal  industry  has  suffered  a  long  series  of  strikes.  Coal  min- 
ers, among  the  best  paid  industrial  workers  of  the  Soviet 
period,  have  organized  strikes  that  have  gained  national  atten- 
tion to  protest  the  industry's  long  delays  in  paying  wages. 
Experts  predict  that  coal  output  will  continue  to  dwindle  as  its 
relative  usefulness  in  industry  and  domestic  applications  is 
reduced.  In  1994  Russia  produced  249  million  tons  of  coal,  and 
in  1995  the  total  rose  to  255  million  tons.  Production  for  the 
first  quarter  of  1996  was  71  million  tons. 

Nuclear  Energy 

In  1996  some  twenty-nine  nuclear  reactors  were  operating  at 
nine  sites:  Balakovo  on  the  northwest  border  of  Kazakstan, 
Beloyarsk  in  the  southern  Urals,  Bilibino  in  northeastern  Sibe- 
ria (the  only  station  east  of  the  Urals),  Kola  in  the  far  north- 
west, Kursk  near  the  Ukrainian  border,  Novovoronezh  on  the 
Don  River,  St.  Petersburg,  Smolensk  west  of  Moscow,  and  Tver' 
northwest  of  Moscow.  Altogether  these  facilities  accounted  for 
10  percent  of  Russia's  energy  generating  capacity  in  1994.  The 
plants  are  operated  by  regional  joint-stock  companies  in  which 
the  Ministry  of  Atomic  Energy  (Minatom)  controls  51  percent 
of  the  shares.  The  nuclear  energy  sector  has  undergone  finan- 
cial problems  because  of  government  funding  reductions.  The 
industry  has  turned  to  selling  goods  related  to  nuclear 
energy — equipment  and  instruments,  nuclear  fuel,  medical 
isotopes,  and  fertilizers. 

The  industry's  financial  problems,  along  with  the  disaster 
that  occurred  at  the  Chernobyl'  plant  in  Ukraine  in  1986,  have 
raised  questions  about  nuclear  safety.  Western  countries  have 
provided  financial  assistance  in  some  cases  because  of  their 
concern  about  Russia's  lax  standards  of  handling  nuclear  mate- 
rials and  the  continued  use  of  outmoded  equipment.  Russia's 
piecemeal  environmental  laws  have  led  to  indiscriminate 
dumping  and  burial  of  radioactive  wastes,  which  are  creating 
severe  environmental  problems.  The  theft  of  nuclear  materials 
has  become  another  source  of  danger  emanating  from  Russia's 
nuclear  energy  program  (see  Environmental  Conditions,  ch.  3; 
The  Crime  Wave  of  the  1990s,  ch.  10). 

Nevertheless,  experts  predict  that  nuclear  energy  probably 
will  play  an  important  role  in  the  Russian  economy  if  enough 
investment  is  available  to  expand  existing  capacity.  In  1992 
Minatom  announced  plans  to  double  nuclear  energy  capacity 


337 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

by  2010,  but  ensuing  financial  problems  have  caused  a  reduc- 
tion of  that  goal,  and  no  new  capacity  has  been  added  since  the 
breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency  (IAEA)  projects  that  construction  of  new  capacity  will 
not  begin  until  after  2005,  even  if  the  investment  climate  is 
favorable. 

Conventional  Power  Generation 

Much  of  the  conventional  fuel  produced  in  Russia  is  burned 
to  produce  electric  power.  The  Unified  Electric  Power  System 
operates  Russia's  electric  power  plants  through  seventy-two 
regional  power  distribution  companies.  The  power  system  con- 
sists of  600  thermal  generating  systems,  more  than  100  hydro- 
electric plants,  and  Russia's  nine  nuclear  plants.  Of  the  total 
rated  generating  capacity  of  205  gigawatts,  only  about  188  giga- 
watts  were  available  as  of  1996.  In  1995  Russia's  power  plants 
generated  a  total  of  846  million  kilowatt-hours,  compared  with 
859  million  kilowatt-hours  in  1994.  Generation  for  the  first 
quarter  of  1996  (normally  the  peak  demand  period  of  the 
year)  was  268  million  kilowatt-hours. 

In  1993  natural  gas  provided  42  percent  of  electricity  pro- 
duction; hydroelectric  plants,  19  percent;  coal,  18  percent; 
nuclear  power,  13  percent;  and  other  sources  such  as  solar  and 
geothermal  plants,  8  percent.  Natural  gas  and  coal  are  burned 
at  thermoelectric  plants,  which  produce  only  electricity,  and  ai 
cogeneration  plants,  which  produce  electricity  and  heat  for 
urban  centers.  The  largest  hydroelectric  plants  are  located  on 
the  Volga,  Kama,  Ob',  Yenisey,  and  Angara  rivers,  where  large 
reservoirs  were  built  in  massive  Soviet  energy  projects.  Ther- 
moelectric and  hydroelectric  plants — located  in  Siberia 
because  of  available  fuels  and  water  power — send  power  to 
European  Russia  through  a  system  of  high-voltage  transmission 
lines. 

Consumption  of  electric  power  divides  into  the  following 
categories:  industrial,  61  percent;  residential,  11  percent;  the 
services  sector,  11  percent;  transportation,  9  percent;  and  agri- 
culture, 8  percent.  Regional  energy  commissions  control  the 
price  of  electricity. 

Foreign  Investment  in  Oil  and  Gas 

In  the  mid-1990s,  many  analysts  consider  the  oil  and  gas 
industries  to  be  the  best  targets  for  foreign  investment  in  Rus- 
sia. The  record  of  foreign  investment  in  that  period  illustrates 


338 


The  Economy 


both  the  potentials  and  the  pitfalls  of  such  ventures.  Experts 
have  concluded  that  the  Russian  oil  and  gas  sector  will  require 
large  amounts  of  foreign  capital  to  improve  output.  According 
to  some  estimates,  the  oil  sector  will  require  US$30  to  US$50 
billion  in  new  investment  just  to  maintain  the  mid-1990s  level 
of  production.  To  return  production  to  its  peak  levels  will 
require  an  estimated  US$70  to  US$130  billion  in  new  invest- 
ments, which  clearly  would  have  to  come  from  foreign  sources. 
The  Russian  oil  and  gas  sector  also  would  benefit  from  infu- 
sions of  Western  technology  and  expertise.  However,  according 
to  a  1995  report  by  Cambridge  Energy  Research  Associates,  key 
figures  in  the  oil  industry,  most  of  whom  were  schooled  in  the 
isolated  Soviet-era  approach  to  commerce,  have  been  indiffer- 
ent or  hostile  to  Western  management  methods. 

By  the  end  of  1994,  the  oil  and  gas  sector  accounted  for 
about  38  percent  of  total  foreign  direct  investment  in  Russia, 
but  the  total  input  was  only  about  US$1.4  billion.  Although 
Western  companies  are  poised  to  commit  large  amounts  of  cap- 
ital for  exploration,  as  of  1996  most  foreign  investment  had 
gone  to  repairing  and  maintaining  current  facilities.  Some  ana- 
lysts have  estimated  that  foreign  investment  in  the  oil  and  gas 
sector  could  reach  US$70  billion  by  the  year  2000. 

Among  several  United  States  oil  companies  active  in  Russia, 
Texaco  heads  a  consortium  in  the  largest  project,  the  develop- 
ment of  oil  fields  in  the  Timan-Pechora  section  of  the  Komi 
region  north  of  the  Arctic  Circle.  The  project,  under  negotia- 
tion since  1989,  has  an  estimated  potential  of  US$45  billion  in 
investment  over  the  next  fifty  years.  Conoco,  a  subsidiary  of  the 
DuPont  de  Nemours  chemical  firm,  leads  a  consortium  of 
United  States  and  European  firms  and  a  Russian  firm  in  the 
Polar  Lights  project  to  explore  Siberian  oil  fields.  Two  United 
States  companies,  Marathon  Oil  and  McDermott,  along  with 
the  Japanese  companies  Mitsui  and  Mitsubishi  and  Britain's 
Royal  Dutch  Shell,  are  engaged  in  one  of  several  projects  to 
explore  for  oil  off  Sakhalin  Island  on  the  Pacific  coast.  The  last 
two  projects  each  could  bring  in  as  much  as  US$10  billion. 

Nevertheless,  Russia's  generally  poor  investment  climate  and 
other  obstacles  such  as  special  taxes  have  discouraged  addi- 
tional investment  in  gas  and  oil.  As  of  mid-1996,  a  tax  of  about 
US$5  per  barrel  was  imposed  on  oil  exports,  and  a  tax  of  about 
US$2.60  was  levied  per  1,000  cubic  meters  of  natural  gas 
exported.  Foreign  and  domestic  firms  were  also  subject  to  roy- 
alty payments  to  the  Government  for  the  privilege  of  drilling

for  oil.  Foreign  investors  have  argued  that  reduced  profit  mar- 
gins are  a  substantial  obstacle  to  the  support  of  some  projects. 
Some  major  oil  investors  have  received  tax  exemptions,  but 
delays  in  rebate  payments  have  created  additional  deterrents. 

Banking  and  Finance 

Experts  have  agreed  that  establishing  a  viable  financial  sec- 
tor is  a  vital  requirement  for  Russia  to  have  a  successful  market 
economy.  In  the  first  five  years  of  the  post-Soviet  era,  the  devel- 
opment of  Russia's  financial  sector  as  an  efficient  distributor  of 
money  and  credit  to  other  parts  of  the  economic  structure  has 
mirrored  the  ups  and  downs  of  the  rest  of  the  economy.  In 
1996  some  elements  of  the  central  planning  system  remained 
obstacles  to  further  progress. 

The  Soviet  Financial  System 

The  financial  system  of  the  Soviet  period  was  a  rudimentary 
mechanism  for  state  control  of  the  economy.  The  government 
owned  and  managed  the  banking  system.  The  State  Bank  (Go- 
sudarstvennyy  bank — Gosbank)  was  the  central  bank  and  the 
only  commercial  bank.  In  its  capacity  as  a  central  bank,  Gos- 
bank handled  all  significant  banking  transactions,  including 
the  issuance  and  control  of  currency  and  credit,  the  manage- 
ment of  gold  reserves,  and  the  oversight  of  transactions  among 
enterprises.  Enterprises  were  issued  money  and  credits  in 
accordance  with  the  government's  planned  allocation  of  wages 
and  its  management  strategy  for  other  expenses. 

Wages  were  paid  only  in  cash,  and  households  used  cash 
exclusively  for  making  payments.  Checkbooks,  credit  cards, 
and  other  alternative  forms  of  payment  were  not  available  in 
the  Soviet  Union.  Wage  earners  could  keep  savings  deposits  in 
the  Savings  Bank  (Sberbank),  where  they  earned  low  interest, 
and  these  funds  were  available  to  the  government  as  a  source 
of  revenue.  Two  other  banks  also  existed  prior  to  1987.  The 
Construction  Bank  (Stroybank)  provided  investment  credits  to 
enterprises,  and  the  Foreign  Trade  Bank  (Vneshtorgbank) 
handled  financial  transactions  pertaining  to  trade. 

In  1987  and  1988,  the  Gorbachev  regime  separated  commer- 
cial banking  operations  from  Gosbank  and  replaced  the  two 
specialized  banks  with  three  banks  to  provide  credit  to  desig- 
nated sectors  of  the  economy:  the  Agro-Industrial  Bank  (Agro- 
prombank),  the  Industry  and  Construction  Bank  (Promstroy- 


340 


The  Economy 


bank),  and  the  Social  Investment  Bank  (Zhilsotsbank),  which 
managed  credits  for  the  social  welfare  sector.  The  Soviet  econ- 
omy also  had  state-controlled  insurance  firms,  but  other  forms 
of  finance  such  as  stocks  and  bonds  did  not  exist. 

The  Financial  Sector  in  the  1990s 

In  the  1990s,  Russia's  financial  sector,  particularly  its  bank- 
ing system,  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  changing  elements  of 
the  economy.  Although  changes  have  moved  clearly  in  the 
direction  of  market  principles,  in  the  mid-1990s  much  addi- 
tional reform  was  necessary  to  achieve  stability. 

Reform  of  the  Banking  System 

The  Russian  banking  system  has  developed  from  the  central- 
ized system  of  the  Soviet  period  into  a  two-tier  system,  includ- 
ing a  central  bank  and  commercial  banks,  that  is  the  standard 
structure  in  market-based  economies.  The  Russian  Central 
Bank  (RCB)  assumed  the  functions  of  Gosbank  in  November 
1991,  and  Gosbank  was  eliminated  when  the  Soviet  Union  dis- 
solved one  month  later.  In  its  first  years  of  existence,  the  RCB 
functioned  under  the  guidelines  of  the  1977  Soviet  constitu- 
tion and  Russian  laws  passed  in  1990,  which  made  the  bank 
essentially  an  arm  of  the  Russian  parliament,  whose  members 
manipulated  bank  policy  to  help  favored  enterprises. 

Russia's  1993  constitution  gave  the  RCB  more  autonomy. 
However,  the  president  has  substantial  influence  on  bank  poli- 
cies through  his  power  to  appoint  the  bank  chairman,  who  in 
turn  wields  extensive  authority  over  bank  operations  and  pol- 
icy. (The  nomination  is  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  State 
Duma.) 

Viktor  Gerashchenko,  a  former  Gosbank  chairman,  was  the 
first  chairman  of  the  RCB.  In  late  1994,  he  resigned  under 
pressure  from  President  Yeltsin  after  the  so-called  Black  Tues- 
day plunge  of  the  ruble's  value  on  exchange  markets  (see  Mon- 
etary and  Fiscal  Policies,  this  ch.).  Yeltsin  named  Tat'yana 
Paramonova  to  replace  Gerashchenko,  but  she  remained  act- 
ing chairman  throughout  her  tenure  because  the  State  Duma 
refused  to  approve  her  appointment.  Powerful  Duma  members 
opposed  Paramonova's  policy  of  restricting  credits  to  favored 
industrial  sectors.  In  November  1995,  the  Duma  approved 
Yeltsin's  nomination  of  Sergey  Dubinin  to  replace  State  Para- 
monova; Dubinin  remained  in  that  position  through  the  end 
of  Yeltsin's  first  term  as  president  in  mid-1996.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 


The  Law  on  the  Central  Bank,  enacted  in  April  1995,  pro- 
vides the  statutory  authority  for  the  RCB.  Under  the  law,  the 
RCB  is  responsible  for  controlling  the  country's  money  supply, 
monitoring  transactions  among  banks,  implementing  the  fed- 
eral budget  and  servicing  Russia's  foreign  debt,  monitoring  the 
foreign-exchange  rate  of  the  ruble,  implementing  Russian 
exchange-rate  policies,  maintaining  foreign  currency  reserves 
and  gold  reserves,  licensing  commercial  banks,  and  regulating 
and  supervising  commercial  banks. 

The  RCB  has  had  the  greatest  impact  on  Russia's  economy 
through  its  role  in  monetary  policy.  The  RCB  controls  the 
money  supply  by  lending  funds  to  commercial  banks  and  by 
establishing  their  reserve  requirements.  For  several  years  after 
its  establishment,  the  RCB  issued  direct  credits  to  enterprises 
and  to  the  agricultural  sector  at  subsidized  rates.  Such  credits 
were  directed  via  commercial  banks  to  politically  influential 
sectors:  agriculture,  the  industrial  and  energy  enterprises  of 
the  northern  regions,  the  energy  sector  in  general,  and  other 
large,  state-run  enterprises. 

In  the  early  years,  the  RCB  also  financed  state  budget  deficits 
by  issuing  credits  to  cover  Government  expenditures.  The 
availability  of  such  credits  played  a  central  role  in  the  high 
inflation  that  the  Russian  economy  endured  between  1991  and 
1994.  In  1995  new  legislation  and  regulations  reduced  this  type 
of  credit  by  prohibiting  the  use  of  credit  to  finance  state  bud- 
get deficits,  and  recent  RCB  chairmen  have  raised  discount 
rates  for  RCB  borrowing  by  commercial  banks.  Such  restric- 
tions have  been  heavily  influenced  by  requirements  of  the  IMF 
to  maintain  strict  fiscal  and  monetary  standards  to  be  eligible 
for  international  financial  assistance  (see  Foreign  Debt,  this 
ch.). 

Initially,  the  RCB's  regulation  of  commercial  banks  also  was 
lax  because  the  banking  sector  grew  rapidly  as  the  centralized 
economy  collapsed  and  because  Russia  had  no  experience  in 
establishing  a  market-based  system.  In  the  early  and  mid-1990s, 
the  failure  of  regulation  led  to  a  plethora  of  new  commercial 
banks,  most  of  which  were  of  dubious  quality. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  assisted  the 
Russian  government  in  establishing  a  core  of  large  banks, 
called  international  standard  banks,  that  met  the  standards  of 
the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  (BIS — see  Glossary). 
The  new  banks  must  conform  to  strict  standards  for  the  size 
and  interest  rates  of  loans;  the  size  of  a  bank's  capital  base;  the 


342 


The  Economy 


volume  of  loan  reserves  that  banks  must  maintain;  and  the 
scrutiny  under  which  banking  activities  will  be  monitored.  The 
International  Standard  Bank  program  anticipates  that  the  core 
of  banks  that  meet  its  requirements  will  grow  until  the  entire 
banking  system  conforms  to  the  BIS  criteria. 

Meanwhile,  plans  called  for  the  RCB  to  remain  the  founda- 
tion of  the  Russian  banking  system.  Its  success  will  depend 
greatly  on  its  retaining  as  much  independence  as  possible  from 
both  the  executive  and  the  legislative  branches  of  government 
and  on  bank  officials'  ability  to  maintain  credible  monetary 
policies. 

Commercial  Banks 

By  the  end  of  1995,  Russia  had  nearly  3,000  commercial 
banks.  However,  most  of  these  banks  were  small  and  had  little 
capitalization.  A  large  portion  of  them  are  financially  linked  to 
companies  and  act  exclusively  as  conduits  of  subsidized  credits 
to  these  enterprises.  The  financial  health  of  such  institutions  is 
highly  questionable,  and  experts  forecast  that  many  of  them 
will  merge  into  larger,  more  viable  institutions  or  go  bankrupt 
as  the  RCB  continues  to  tighten  its  requirements  and  as  the 
role  of  cheap  credits  diminishes. 

The  commercial  banking  system  has  a  core  of  large,  viable 
banks  that  have  attained  financial  credibility  and  that  experts 
expect  to  remain  in  operation  under  any  foreseeable  economic 
conditions.  The  former  state-controlled  specialized  banks  of 
the  Soviet  system  form  the  foundation  of  the  current  commer- 
cial banking  system,  including  the  six  largest  commercial  banks 
in  Russia.  In  1991  three  of  the  banks — the  Agroprombank 
(subsequently  renamed  Rossel'bank),  the  Promstroybank,  and 
the  Zhilsotsbank  (reorganized  into  Mosbusinessbank) — were 
reorganized  into  joint-stock  companies  and  became  indepen- 
dent commercial  operations,  forming  the  foundation  of  the 
commercial  banking  system. 

The  Soviet-era  Savings  Bank  (Sberbank)  was  reorganized  as 
the  Sberbank  of  Russia,  with  the  RCB  holding  controlling 
shares.  In  1996  the  Sberbank  held  between  60  and  70  percent 
of  Russians'  total  household  savings;  that  figure  decreased  from 
90  percent  in  1991  as  other  commercial  banks  began  to  pro- 
vide competition.  The  Foreign  Trade  Bank  (Rosvneshtorg- 
bank)  also  remains  state-controlled,  and  it  continues  to  handle 
most  foreign  transactions,  although  by  the  mid-1990s  it 
received  competition  from  newer,  privately  owned  banks.  The 


343 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Moscow  International  Bank  handles  business  between  the  large 
Russian  banks  and  Western  banks.  Sberbank  and  Rossel'bank 
have  systems  of  nationwide  branches. 

The  types  and  quality  of  services  that  the  Russian  banking 
system  offers  to  the  public  are  still  rudimentary  according  to 
the  standards  of  Western  industrialized  countries.  They  are 
unable  to  offer  diverse  and  efficient  customer  services  because 
the  Soviet  Union  had  no  retail  banking  tradition  and  because 
Russia  lacks  the  sophisticated  infrastructure,  especially  high- 
speed telecommunications  and  trained  staffs,  on  which  mod- 
ern Western  financial  institutions  depend. 

Most  of  the  commercial  banks  offer  their  customers  savings 
deposit  accounts,  and  the  more  established  banks  provide  for- 
eign-exchange services,  investment  services,  and  corporate  ser- 
vices. Bank  checks  are  still  rarely  used  in  Russia  because  check 
clearance  is  a  long  process.  Some  banks  offer  debit  cards  that 
allow  customers  to  have  payments  for  goods  and  services 
deducted  directly  from  their  bank  balances.  Some  banks  also 
offer  credit  cards  to  customers  with  impeccable  credit  ratings. 
The  continued  predominance  of  cash  transactions  has  slowed 
the  rate  of  Russia's  commerce. 

Although  foreign  banks  have  played  a  larger  role  in  the  Rus- 
sian economy  in  the  mid-1990s,  that  role  has  met  substantial 
resistance  from  nationalist  factions.  In  early  1996,  the  State 
Duma  passed  a  statute  prohibiting  the  RCB  from  licensing  for- 
eign banks  that  did  not  have  operations  in  Russia  before 
November  1993.  However,  opponents  of  such  a  policy  have 
pointed  out  that  efforts  to  protect  the  fledgling  domestic  bank- 
ing sector  from  foreign  competition  also  deny  access  to  West- 
ern financial  techniques  that  eventually  would  improve  the 
competitiveness  of  Russian  banks. 

Other  Financial  Institutions 

A  Russian  securities  market  has  evolved  with  the  rest  of  the 
economy.  When  the  first  Russian  stock  market  was  established 
in  1991,  few  private  companies  existed  to  offer  shares,  so  trad- 
ing activity  was  quite  low.  The  securities  market  got  a  large 
boost  from  the  Russian  government's  privatization  campaign. 
Shares  in  privatized  firms  were  issued,  and  then  a  secondary 
market  emerged  for  the  privatization  vouchers  that  the  govern- 
ment issued  to  each  citizen  (see  Privatization,  this  ch.).  As  the 
first  phase  of  the  privatization  program  ended  and  companies' 


344 


The  Economy 


capital  requirements  rose,  an  efficient  securities  market 
became  increasingly  important. 

Russian  laws  and  regulations  of  the  stock  market  and  other 
elements  of  the  securities  market  have  not  kept  pace  with  the 
growth  in  the  industry,  fostering  irregularities  in  the  market. 
Among  the  most  infamous  was  the  operation  of  the  MMM 
investment  company,  which  developed  into  a  pyramid  scheme 
guaranteeing  investors  very  high  returns  on  their  investments. 
A  number  of  Russian  small  investors,  whose  savings  had  been 
eroded  severely  by  inflation,  were  attracted  to  the  scheme  and 
eventually  lost  large  sums  of  money.  The  head  of  MMM,  Sergey 
Mavrodi,  was  arrested  and  jailed  on  tax  fraud,  but  the  MMM 
case  underlined  the  lack  of  Western-style  commercial  laws  in 
the  Russian  legal  system.  The  Russian  securities  market  also 
lacks  a  modern  communications  infrastructure,  so  registration 
and  reporting  of  financial  transactions  are  very  slow. 

In  1993  the  Government  added  a  new  element  to  the  securi- 
ties market  by  issuing  treasury  bonds  to  help  finance  its  budget 
deficits.  In  addition,  Russian  citizens  are  able  to  buy  and  sell 
rubles  for  foreign  currency  at  selected  banks.  The  exchange 
rate  is  established  through  weekly  auctions  on  the  Moscow 
International  Currency  Exchange  (MICEX). 

Insurance  remains  a  small  part  of  the  Russian  financial  mar- 
ket. In  1996  approximately  200  insurance  companies  were 
operating  in  Russia,  including  the  privatized  versions  of  former 
Soviet  state  insurance  companies.  According  to  experts,  Rus- 
sia's relatively  new  financial  institutions  are  likely  to  face  a  long 
period  of  adjustment  as  weaker  banks  close  or  merge  with 
stronger  banks,  and  a  regulatory  framework  must  be  developed 
to  ensure  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and  enable 
banks  to  offer  reliable  support  in  the  development  of  private 
enterprise — a  role  that  has  expanded  rapidly  in  the  first  five 
post-Soviet  years.  Other  aspects  of  the  financial  system,  such  as 
securities  markets,  also  lack  the  degree  of  standardized  regula- 
tion required  for  large-scale  domestic  participation.  However, 
as  the  private  sector's  role  in  the  national  economy  grows  and 
as  Russia  develops  needed  regulations  and  infrastructure,  the 
securities  markets  and  other  nonbank  financial  institutions  are 
expected  to  follow  the  banks  as  important  elements  of  the 
economy. 

Taxation 

Throughout  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  international  finan- 


345 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

cial  institutions  warned  Russia  that  major  adjustments  were 
needed  in  the  structure  and  the  administration  of  the  coun- 
try's tax-collection  system.  However,  in  1996  few  meaningful 
changes  had  emerged.  Tax  reforms  until  that  time  had  empha- 
sized revenue  from  income,  consumption,  and  trade,  with  the 
value-added  tax  (VAT — see  Glossary),  corporate  profits  taxes, 
and  personal  income  taxes  accounting  for  60  to  70  percent  of 
total  revenue  (see  table  16,  Appendix).  Beginning  in  1993, 
experts  have  pointed  to  changes  in  the  bases  and  rates  of  the 
profit  tax  and  the  VAT  as  a  major  cause  of  declining  revenues. 
Between  1993  and  1994,  the  ratio  of  taxes  collected  to  GDP 
declined  from  41  percent  to  36  percent,  although  the  percent- 
age of  GDP  paid  in  taxes  already  was  lower  in  Russia  than  in 
any  of  the  Western  market  economies.  In  the  first  quarter  of 
1996,  only  56  percent  of  planned  tax  revenue  was  realized. 

The  system  in  place  in  1996  taxed  the  profits  of  enterprises 
heavily,  especially  in  comparison  with  the  tax  burden  of  per- 
sonal income.  In  1993  business  profit  taxes  were  three  to  seven 
times  higher  than  in  Western  economies,  and  personal  income 
taxes  were  two  to  four  times  lower.  That  emphasis  was  not  con- 
ducive to  expanding  investment,  and  many  non-wage  sources 
of  income  were  not  captured  by  personal  income  tax  stan- 
dards. According  to  a  1996  estimate,  Russians  kept  US$30  bil- 
lion to  US$60  billion  in  foreign  banks  to  avoid  taxation. 

The  VAT,  which  is  levied  on  imported  and  domestic  goods,  is 
set  at  21.5  percent  for  most  purchases  and  10  percent  for  a 
specified  list  of  foods.  Administration  of  that  tax  is  complicated 
by  uneven  compliance  and  accounting  rules  that  do  not  define 
clearly  the  amounts  to  be  classified  as  value  added.  Taxation  on 
the  extraction  and  sale  of  natural  resources  is  a  major  revenue 
source,  but  the  current  system  yields  disproportionately  little 
revenue  from  the  energy  sector,  especially  the  natural  gas 
industry.  Excise  taxes  are  levied  on  merchandise  of  both 
domestic  and  foreign  origin.  The  tax  on  imported  luxury  items 
ranges  from  10  to  400  percent,  and  the  rate  on  imports  has 
been  kept  higher  than  for  domestic  products  in  order  to  pro- 
tect domestic  industries. 

Taxes  on  trade  are  a  major  revenue  source.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  export  taxes  became  a  more  important  source  of  reve- 
nue as  other  types  of  trade  control  were  eliminated.  Frequent 
changes  in  the  tariff  schedule  for  imported  goods  have  led  to 
confusion  among  importers.  The  average  tariff  rate  in  mid- 


346 


The  Economy 


1995  was  17  percent,  but  a  reduction  of  maximum  rates  was 
announced  for  the  medium  term. 

Russia's  taxation  agency  is  the  State  Taxation  Service  (STS), 
which  was  established  to  administer  the  new  market-based  tax 
system  installed  in  1991  and  1992.  Although  in  the  mid-1990s 
its  staff  of  162,000  employees  was  much  larger  than  tax  agen- 
cies in  Western  countries,  the  STS  has  been  hampered  by  poor 
organization,  inadequate  automation,  and  an  untrained  staff. 
Training  and  reorganization  programs  were  announced  in 
1995,  and  some  streamlining  has  resulted  in  separating  the 
roles  of  various  levels  of  government,  identification  of  tax-eligi- 
ble individuals  and  corporations,  and  application  of  penalties 
for  tax  evasion  and  tax  arrears. 

Experts  have  identified  the  most  serious  defect  of  the  tax 
administration  system  as  the  ad  hoc  granting  of  tax  exemp- 
tions, which  distorts  the  overall  revenue  system  and  under- 
mines the  authority  of  administrators.  The  most  problematic 
examples  of  this  practice  are  exemptions  granted  to  agricul- 
tural producers  and  the  oil  and  natural  gas  industries. 

The  Labor  Force 

Literacy  and  education  levels  among  the  Russian  population 
(148  million  in  1996)  are  relatively  high,  largely  because  the 
Soviet  system  placed  great  emphasis  on  education  (see  The 
Soviet  Heritage,  ch.  5).  Some  92  percent  of  the  Russian  people 
have  completed  at  least  secondary  school,  and  11  percent  have 
completed  some  form  of  higher  education  (university  and 
above).  In  1995  about  57  percent  of  the  Russian  population 
was  of  working  age,  which  the  government  defined  as  between 
the  ages  of  sixteen  and  fifty-five  for  women  and  between  the 
ages  of  sixteen  and  sixty  for  men,  and  20  percent  had  passed 
working  age.  Women  make  up  more  than  half  the  work  force. 

Although  size,  age,  and  education  would  seem  to  place  the 
Russian  labor  force  in  a  good  position  to  participate  in  devel- 
oping a  modern,  industrialized  economy,  it  is  not  clear  that  the 
skills  that  Russian  workers  attained  during  the  Soviet  period 
are  those  required  for  a  market  economy.  In  1994  the  construc- 
tion, industry,  and  agriculture  sectors  employed  53.5  percent 
of  the  work  force,  and  the  services  sector  employed  37  percent, 
a  distribution  typical  of  developing  economies.  By  contrast,  67 
percent  of  the  United  States  labor  force  is  in  the  services  sector, 
and  22  percent  is  in  agriculture,  industry,  and  construction,  a 
configuration  typical  of  modern  industrialized  market  econo-

mies.  The  Russian  pattern  reflects  the  emphasis  that  Soviet  eco- 
nomic planners  placed  on  the  nonservice  sectors.  Even  among 
the  highly  skilled  labor  force,  the  Soviet  economy  (and  the 
national  education  system  as  a  whole)  skewed  training  toward 
the  sciences,  mathematics,  and  engineering  and  gave  little 
attention  to  education  in  management  and  entrepreneurship. 
This  pattern  of  work  training  and  general  education  has  con- 
tinued in  the  1990s;  according  to  experts,  its  continued  pres- 
ence indicates  that  the  economy  may  not  be  able  to  depend  on 
younger  workers  to  expand  the  fund  of  service-sector  skills 
needed  for  a  modern  market  economy.  In  any  case,  as  the  Rus- 
sian economy  progresses  toward  a  market  structure,  middle- 
aged  and  older  workers  will  increasingly  find  themselves  play- 
ing a  marginal  role. 

The  living  standards  of  Russia's  workers  have  been  eroded  by 
two  factors.  First,  the  severe  depression  of  the  country's 
extended  economic  transition  has  left  a  large  share  of  the  work 
force  either  unemployed,  underemployed,  or  receiving 
reduced  wages.  Second,  labor  lacks  an  effective  organization  to 
protect  its  interests.  Neither  trade  unions  from  the  Soviet  era 
nor  new,  independent  organizations  have  provided  effective, 
united  representation.  As  of  mid-1996,  negative  conditions  had 
not  yielded  the  large-scale  unrest  that  many  experts  had  pre- 
dicted in  the  working  class. 

Unemployment 

The  growth  of  unemployment  has  been  the  bane  of  many  of 
the  Central  and  East  European  countries  in  the  transition  from 
centrally  planned  to  market  economies.  Russia's  unemploy- 
ment rate  has  been  hard  to  measure  accurately  because  many 
firms  unofficially  furlough  workers  but  leave  them  on  company 
rolls.  This  practice  is  a  vestige  of  the  paternalistic  Soviet  era, 
when  the  presence  of  workers  in  an  enterprise  often  had  no 
relation  to  that  enterprise's  actual  production.  Many  of  these 
furloughed  workers  find  gainful  employment  in  the  private  sec- 
tor, where  wages  often  go  unreported.  Such  a  system  results  in 
a  haphazard,  inefficient  allocation  of  the  labor  force. 

Western  and  Russian  analysts  have  relied  on  International 
Labour  Organisation  measurements,  which  indicate  that  at  the 
end  of  1995,  Russian  unemployment  had  reached  8.2  percent 
(see  table  17,  Appendix).  The  Russian  journal  Ekonomika  i 
zhizn'  estimated  the  figure  at  8.6  percent,  or  6.3  million  people, 
for  the  first  quarter  of  1996.  Although  the  last  figure  still  is 


348 


The  Economy 


below  the  unemployment  rates  of  Poland  and  some  other 
countries  in  transition,  the  full  extent  of  unemployment  has 
been  masked  by  extended  subsidies  that  delayed  the  shutdown 
of  large  Russian  enterprises.  In  1995  nearly  half  of  plant  direc- 
tors surveyed  said  that  they  had  more  workers  than  they 
needed. 

Unemployment  varies  considerably  according  to  region. 
Moscow's  unemployment  rate,  the  lowest  in  Russia,  was  0.6  per- 
cent in  March  1996.  The  Republic  of  Ingushetia,  which  also  has 
had  the  highest  immigration  rate  because  of  its  proximity  to 
Chechnya,  reported  a  rate  of  23.5  percent  in  December  1995. 
In  March  1996,  Ivanovo,  a  textile  center  east  of  Moscow,  had  a 
rate  of  13  percent,  and  the  Republic  of  Udmurtia,  a  center  of 
the  struggling  military-industrial  complex,  reported  9.4  per- 
cent (see  The  Defense  Industry,  ch.  9).  At  that  time,  women 
constituted  62  percent  of  Russia's  officially  unemployed,  and 
37  percent  of  the  total  were  people  below  the  age  of  thirty. 

The  Federal  Employment  Service  (Federal'naya  sluzhba  zan- 
yatosti — FSZ),  the  agency  in  charge  of  issuing  unemployment 
benefits  and  placing  unemployed  workers,  had  only  3.7  per- 
cent of  the  working  population  registered  for  benefits  in 
March  1996;  many  jobless  workers  do  not  register  because  ben- 
efits are  so  small  (averaging  US$22  per  month  in  1995)  and 
because,  after  the  guaranteed  employment  of  the  Soviet  era, 
joblessness  entails  a  significant  stigma  for  many  Russians.  How- 
ever, as  the  average  term  of  unemployment  grew  from  six  to 
eight  months  between  1994  and  1995,  more  workers  partici- 
pated in  FSZ  programs.  In  1995  the  service  placed  an  estimated 
1.7  million  workers  in  new  jobs.  That  year,  9.8  million  workers 
left  positions  and  8.7  million  were  hired,  and  the  majority  of 
those  who  left  did  so  voluntarily — many  because  wages  were 
not  paid — rather  than  because  of  dismissal.  Shortages  exist  in 
some  types  of  skilled  labor,  and  some  companies  actively 
recruit  workers. 

Wages 

By  1995  delays  in  wage  payment  had  become  a  chronic  prob- 
lem even  in  profitable  Russian  enterprises.  In  many  cases, 
enterprises  simply  passed  along  the  burden  of  late  payments  of 
state  subsidies  and  customer  debts.  At  the  end  of  1995,  the  Gov- 
ernment owed  a  total  of  US$112  billion  of  subsidies,  of  which 
about  27  percent  were  more  than  three  months  overdue.  Most 
of  its  debt  was  to  the  military  and  energy  sectors.  Through  1995 


349 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

an  average  of  19  percent  of  wages  were  paid  late,  and  in  Janu- 
ary 1996  a  total  of  US$2.1  billion  was  overdue  in  agriculture, 
construction,  industry,  and  transportation.  The  State  Commit- 
tee for  Statistics  (Goskomstat)  began  keeping  separate  statistics 
for  wages  formally  paid  and  those  actually  delivered.  The  pay- 
ment record  of  privatized  enterprises  was  worse  than  that  of 
state  enterprises,  and  in  many  cases  workers  were  paid  in  mer- 
chandise rather  than  in  cash.  In  early  1996,  the  average  rates  of 
overdue  payment  were  62  percent  in  ferrous  metallurgy,  86 
percent  in  oil  extraction,  and  22  percent  in  food  processing. 

In  his  presidential  campaign,  Yeltsin  promised  to  abolish 
state-sector  wage  arrears  and  to  encourage  improvement  in  the 
private  sector.  By  squeezing  the  national  budget,  Yeltsin 
achieved  temporary  results  in  the  state  sector,  but  his  promise 
had  no  effect  on  other  enterprises.  Officials  proposed  several 
programs  to  raise  average  wages  and  streamline  the  inefficient 
system  by  which  wages  are  delivered,  but  no  meaningful  reform 
had  been  achieved  by  mid-1996.  In  July  1996,  coal  strikes  in  the 
Far  East,  southwestern  Russia,  southern  Siberia,  and  the  Urals 
threatened  a  nationwide  shutdown  in  response  to  continued 
payment  failures  in  that  industry 

Manufacturing 

Beginning  in  1921,  Lenin's  Soviet  government  made  indus- 
trial modernization  a  priority.  But  it  was  under  Stalin  that  the 
system  of  central  planning  was  fully  developed  and  the  industri- 
alization of  the  Russian  Republic  reached  its  peak.  Throughout 
the  Stalin  period,  investment  resources  were  directed  into 
heavy  manufacturing  at  the  expense  of  consumer  or  light 
industry 

During  the  later  Soviet  period,  economic  reformers  such  as 
Nikita  Khrushchev  attempted  to  shift  some  resources  to  the 
consumer  industries,  but  the  emphasis  eventually  shifted  back 
to  heavy  and  military  industries.  This  emphasis  was  especially 
strong  while  the  Soviet  Union  was  building  its  military  base 
during  the  Cold  War.  In  the  1970s,  manufacturing  productivity 
declined.  As  part  of  his  perestroika  program  in  the  late  1980s, 
Gorbachev  redirected  resources  to  consumer  goods,  but  the 
effort  proved  insufficient  to  forestall  the  decay  of  the  manufac- 
turing sector. 

In  the  1990s,  Russia  urgently  needed  a  revival  of  the  manu- 
facturing sector  to  provide  employment  and  steer  the  restruc- 
turing of  industrial  priorities  away  from  the  impractical  Soviet 


350 


The  Economy 


emphasis  on  subsidized  heavy  industry  and  the  military-indus- 
trial complex  (MIC).  Although  a  substantial  share  of  Russia's 
MIC  enterprises  underwent  full  or  partial  conversion  to  civilian 
production  and  most  manufacturers  were  partially  or  fully 
privatized,  manufacturing  output  continued  a  general  decline 
in  the  mid-1990s  (see  table  18,  Appendix).  This  trend  had 
slowed  by  1995,  when  the  decrease  in  total  industrial  produc- 
tion was  4  percent  compared  with  1994;  the  1994  total  had 
been  23  percent  below  that  of  1993. 

Ferrous  Metallurgy 

The  Soviet  Union's  ferrous  metallurgy  industry  was  a  show- 
piece of  centralized  planning  of  heavy  industry.  The  fast-grow- 
ing industry,  vital  in  supplying  other  heavy  industries  with 
semifinished  inputs,  led  the  world  in  output  in  the  1970s  and 
the  1980s.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1980s,  however,  ferrous  metal- 
lurgy did  not  keep  pace  with  the  demands  of  domestic  industry 
and  foreign  markets  for  more  sophisticated  and  stronger  metal 
materials.  Many  older  plants  with  outmoded  technology 
remained  in  full  production;  Soviet  plans  called  for  refitting 
the  industry  in  the  1990s,  but  Russia's  resources  have  not  been 
sufficient  for  such  a  massive  project. 

In  1994  the  ferrous  and  nonferrous  metallurgical  industries 
accounted  for  about  16  percent  of  industrial  output.  In  1996 
more  than  80  percent  of  Russia's  steel  output  came  from  eight 
plants,  although  about  100  plants  were  in  operation.  Among 
the  industry's  most  important  products  are  pipe,  pig  iron, 
smelted  steel,  finished  rolled  metal,  and  shaped  section  steel. 
The  four  largest  steel  enterprises  are  the  Novolipetsk  and 
Cherepovets  metallurgical  plants,  located  southeast  and  north 
of  Moscow,  respectively,  and  the  Magnitogorsk  and  Nizhniy 
Tagil  metallurgical  combines,  located  in  the  Ural  industrial 
region.  In  1995  the  Cherepovets  plant  was  re-formed  as  the 
Severstal'  (Northern  Steel)  Joint-Stock  Company.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  more  than  half  of  Russia's  steel  production  came  from 
the  outmoded  open-hearth  furnace  process;  the  more  modern 
continuous  casting  method  accounted  for  only  24  percent  of 
output. 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the  steel  industry  was  hit  espe- 
cially hard  by  Russia's  overall  economic  decline,  which  caused 
domestic  consumption  to  drop  sharply;  by  1996  only  50  to  60 
percent  of  capacity  was  in  use.  Between  1991  and  1994,  output 
of  rolled  steel  dropped  from  55.1  million  tons  to  35.8  millions 


351 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

tons.  Foreign  sales  were  especially  important  as  the  only  source 
of  hard  currency  for  some  enterprises,  accounting  for  as  much 
as  60  percent  of  output  in  some  cases.  In  1995  Russian  exports 
increased  by  30  percent,  making  Russia  the  second  largest 
exporter  of  ferrous  metals  in  the  world.  The  profitability  of 
such  sales  dropped  substantially  between  1994  and  1996,  how- 
ever. Much  of  the  steel  industry's  domestic  business  was  pay- 
ment in  kind  to  input  suppliers  and  railroads.  Production  costs 
are  raised  by  the  prices  of  such  domestic  inputs  as  coal  and 
iron  ore  and  transportation,  which  averaged  at  or  above  world 
levels  in  1996.  Another  major  cost  to  the  ferrous  metallurgy 
sector  is  social  support  programs  for  workers.  Those  costs  in 
turn  raise  domestic  metal  prices  above  international  levels. 

Nonferrous  Metallurgy 

The  Noril'sk  Nickel  Joint-Stock  Company  dominates  Russia's 
nonferrous  metallurgy  industries.  It  controls  nearly  all  of  the 
country's  aluminum  and  nickel  production  and  60  percent  of 
copper  production.  The  largest  operations  in  the  industry  are 
Noril'sk  Nickel  in  northwestern  Siberia  and  Bratsk  Aluminum, 
Krasnoyarsk  Aluminum,  and  Sayan  Aluminum  in  south-central 
Siberia.  More  than  90  percent  of  Russia's  aluminum  comes 
from  six  smelters.  Some  smelters  have  been  privatized  and 
export  their  semifinished  products.  Inputs,  especially  alumina 
(of  which  Russia  has  little),  became  much  more  expensive  in 
the  mid-1990s,  as  did  transportation  and  electricity  costs.  At  the 
same  time,  export  revenues  fell. 

The  Automotive  Industry 

In  1993  Russia's  automotive  industry  produced  956,000  pas- 
senger automobiles,  a  decrease  from  the  1991  figure  of 
1,030,000  automobiles.  During  the  Soviet  period,  the  industry 
had  gained  a  reputation  for  extremely  slow  production  of  very 
unreliable  vehicles.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  plant  rated  most  effi- 
cient, the  Volga  Automotive  Plant  (Avtovaz)  at  Tol'yatti, 
required  about  thirty  times  as  long  to  assemble  an  automobile 
as  the  leading  plants  in  Japan.  All  Russian  vehicle  plants  oper- 
ated at  far  below  capacity,  with  outmoded  machinery  and 
bloated  work  forces.  Avtovaz,  the  most  productive  plant,  oper- 
ated at  about  70  percent  of  capacity,  and  the  Gor'kiy  Automo- 
tive Plant  (GAZ)  in  Nizhniy  Novgorod  was  the  only  other  major 
plant  operating  above  30  percent  in  1995.  The  two  main  truck 
manufacturers,  the  Likhachev  Automotive  Plant  (ZIL)  in  Mos- 


352

dealership,  Moscow

cow  and  the  Kama  Automotive  Plant  (KamAZ)  in  Naberezh- 
nyye  Chelny,  have  suffered  especially  from  reductions  in  orders 
by  their  main  customers — the  armed  forces  and  collective 
farms.  GAZ  has  successfully  marketed  a  light  truck,  of  which  it 
sold  75,000  in  1995,  mainly  to  small  businesses.  The  traditional 
Soviet  truck  was  a  heavy  diesel  model  with  limited  service  life. 

Although  demand  for  passenger  automobiles  has  increased 
substantially  in  Russia  over  the  last  twenty-five  years,  output  has 
not  responded  even  in  the  post-Soviet  period.  In  1994  only 
eighty-four  autos  were  registered  per  1,000  people.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  all  automobile  plants  retained  the  Soviet  style  of  organi- 
zation, which  is  incapable  of  self-financing  or  effective  market- 
ing. The  lack  of  post-Soviet  government  subsidies  has  placed 
most  enterprises  in  danger  of  extinction.  Some  Russian  enter- 
prises have  proposed  joint  ventures  with  Western  firms,  but  in 
many  cases  the  Russian  partners  lack  funding  for  such  ven- 
tures. Meanwhile,  foreign  imports  further  endanger  the  indus- 
try: in  1994  only  65,000  automobiles  were  imported  legally,  but 
another  250,000  to  500,000  entered  Russia  illegally.  Therefore, 
most  new  cars  in  Russian  cities  are  foreign.  (In  1996  govern- 
ment vehicles  were  exclusively  Audi,  Mercedes-Benz,  Saab,  or 
Volvo).  Exports  of  Russian  passenger  cars  declined  in  the  early 
1990s.

Machine  Building 

In  the  Soviet  period,  the  machine-building  industry  was  at 
the  center  of  the  industrial  modernization  programs  that 
required  a  steady  supply  of  capital  equipment  to  respond  to 
new  demands.  However,  the  inefficient  organization  of  indus- 
trial planning  caused  bottlenecks  in  crucial  programs  and  gen- 
erally unreliable  performance.  The  industry  is  concentrated  in 
the  European  part  of  Russia,  with  major  facilities  in  Moscow,  St. 
Petersburg,  Nizhniy  Novgorod,  and  the  Ural  industrial  region. 
(Russian  machine  building  includes  the  automotive,  construc- 
tion equipment,  and  aviation  industries  as  well  as  the  tractor, 
electrical  equipment,  instrument  making,  consumer  appliance, 
and  machine  industries.) 

Between  1985  and  1995,  production  of  most  categories  of 
machines  decreased  significantly,  mainly  because  of  declining 
domestic  orders.  For  example,  by  1992  production  of  metal- 
cutting  machines  had  dropped  by  20  percent,  washing 
machines  by  47  percent,  turbines  by  36  percent,  and  tractors  by 
45  percent.  In  1993  production  of  about  one-third  of  sixty-two 
major  categories  of  products  declined  by  at  least  50  percent.  In 
1995  production  for  the  entire  machine-building  complex  was 
about  4  percent  below  the  1994  level. 

Light  Industry 

The  most  important  branch  of  light  industry  is  cotton  tex- 
tiles, which  has  production  centers  in  Ivanovo,  Kostroma,  Yaro- 
slavl', and  about  two  dozen  smaller  cities  between  the  Volga 
and  Oka  rivers  east  of  Moscow.  The  economic  slump  of  the 
1990s  had  a  dramatic  effect  on  textile  production  and  other 
light  industries.  In  1995  Russia's  light  industry  suffered  the 
sharpest  drop  in  production  of  all  economic  sectors,  slumping 
by  an  estimated  25  to  30  percent  compared  with  the  previous 
year.  Prices  for  light-industry  goods  increased  by  an  average  of 
2.9  times  in  1995  after  having  increased  by  5.6  times  in  1994. 

Unemployment  in  Russia's  textile  production  centers  has 
been  among  the  highest  in  the  country.  In  early  1996,  an  esti- 
mated 70  percent  of  workers  in  the  industry  were  on  furlough 
or  working  part-time.  The  chief  cause  is  the  Russian  consum- 
ers' decline  in  personal  income,  hence  in  demand.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  consumers  purchased  most  of  their  textile  products  at 
flea  markets,  which  offered  both  a  wider  variety  of  merchan- 
dise and  cheaper  prices  than  most  stores.  By  the  end  of  1995, 


354 


The  Economy 


orders  for  all  types  of  light-industrial  production  were  48  per- 
cent of  the  average  for  the  previous  years.  Production  declined 
by  20  percent  in  fabrics,  21  percent  in  leather  shoes,  and  44 
percent  in  knitted  goods,  but  stocks  of  finished  products  grew 
because  demand  decreased  at  a  faster  rate. 

The  high  price  of  cotton  also  has  hampered  the  textile 
industry,  which  had  been  accustomed  to  paying  low  prices  for 
its  raw  material  when  the  major  suppliers  in  Central  Asia  were 
part  of  the  Soviet  economic  system.  Although  their  cotton  is 
not  of  high  quality,  Central  Asian  sellers  now  charge  world  mar- 
ket prices.  (Cotton  from  the  "far  abroad,"  outside  the  former 
Soviet  Union,  is  even  more  expensive,  however.)  In  1996  indus- 
try experts  expect  some  improvement  because  of  expanding 
export  markets  in  Europe  and  new  investment  in  light  industry 
by  Russia's  banks.  They  also  expect  an  increase  in  domestic 
shoe  manufacturing  in  the  1990s  because  the  high  import 
duties  on  foreign  shoes  make  them  twice  as  expensive  as  Rus- 
sian shoes — although  in  1996  some  65  percent  of  shoes  sold  in 
Russia  were  imported.  The  former  member  countries  of  the 
Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glos- 
sary) were  the  chief  source  of  such  goods. 

Chemicals 

The  centers  of  the  chemical  industry  traditionally  have  been 
areas  where  critical  raw  materials  and  allied  industries  were 
available.  Before  1960  plants  were  near  mineral  deposits, 
potato  farms,  coking  coal,  and  nonferrous  metallurgy  plants. 
When  oil  and  natural  gas  became  prime  raw  materials  for 
chemical  production,  plants  were  built  near  the  Volga-Ural  and 
North  Caucasus  gas  and  oil  fields  or  along  pipelines.  In  the 
1980s,  major  plants  were  built  at  Omsk,  Tobol'sk,  Urengoy,  and 
Surgut  in  the  western  Siberia  oil  region  and  at  Ufa  and  Nizh- 
nekamsk in  the  Volga-Ural  region.  In  the  same  period,  the  gov- 
ernment gave  strong  investment  and  research  support  to 
chemical  production  because  of  its  importance  to  the  rest  of 
heavy  industry. 

The  major  divisions  of  the  chemical  industry  are  paints  and 
varnishes,  rubber  and  asbestos  products,  synthetic  tar  and  plas- 
tic products,  mined  chemical  products,  household  chemicals 
and  washing  compounds,  mineral  fertilizers,  chemical  fibers 
and  filaments,  and  paper  and  pulp.  In  the  1990s,  output  has 
decreased  in  all  of  those  areas.  Among  representative  products, 
between  1985  and  the  early  1990s  production  of  mineral  fertil-

izers  dropped  by  29  percent,  agricultural  pesticides  by  74  per- 
cent, industrial  carbon  by  28  percent,  sulfuric  acid  by  19 
percent,  synthetic  tars  and  plastics  by  16  percent,  paints  and 
varnishes  by  43  percent,  household  soaps  by  25  percent,  and 
caustic  soda  by  15  percent. 

Based  on  Russia's  huge  supply  of  timber,  a  substantial  lum- 
ber-processing and  pulp  industry  developed  in  the  Soviet 
period  as  a  subsidiary  of  the  chemical  industry  In  1996  Russia's 
largest  pulp  and  paper  enterprises  were  at  Kondopoga  near  the 
Finnish  border,  Bratsk  west  of  Lake  Baikal,  Syktyvkar  in  the 
Republic  of  Komi,  and  Kotlas  southeast  of  Arkhangelsk.  Most 
pulp  and  paper  companies  do  not  own  timber  resources,  but 
timber  suppliers,  who  lease  timberland  from  the  state,  gener- 
ally sell  raw  materials  at  below  world  prices,  giving  Russian 
manufacturers  a  competitive  advantage.  Some  mergers  have 
occurred  between  suppliers  and  manufacturing  operations. 

In  the  early  1990s,  production  of  raw  timber  dropped  by 
about  25  percent,  mainly  because  of  equipment  depletion,  lack 
of  credit,  higher  railroad  transport  fees,  and  a  drop  in  con- 
struction of  lumber  roads.  In  1993  production  of  raw  timber 
was  450,000  cubic  meters,  75  percent  of  the  1992  total;  produc- 
tion of  commercial  cellulose  was  79  percent  of  the  previous 
year's  total;  and  of  cardboard,  73  percent  (see  Environmental 
Conditions,  ch.  3). 

Transportation  and  Telecommunications 

As  with  the  rest  of  the  economy,  the  transportation  and  tele- 
communications infrastructures  of  the  Russian  economy  con- 
tinue to  bear  the  imprint  of  Soviet  central  planning.  CPSU 
priorities  shaped  those  systems,  and  they  are  generally  inappro- 
priate to  serve  the  needs  of  a  market  economy.  Many  analysts 
contend  that  inferior  transportation  and  communications  con- 
stitute a  major  impediment  to  Russian  economic  growth. 

Transportation 

The  transportation  system  during  the  Soviet  period  was 
organized  in  the  form  of  vertically  integrated  monopolies  con- 
trolled by  the  central  government.  Thus,  for  example,  the  same 
administrative  agency  owned  and  operated  the  airports,  air- 
lines, and  enterprises  that  manufactured  aircraft.  The  infra- 
structure eroded  seriously  in  the  late  Soviet  period  and

requires  much  modernization  and  reform,  for  which  Russia 
relies  heavily  on  foreign  investment  and  aid. 

Roads 

Roads  were  one  of  the  least-used  forms  of  transportation  in 
the  Soviet  Union,  a  characteristic  that  has  continued  in  the 
Russian  Federation.  Soviet  industry  placed  little  emphasis  on 
the  production  of  automobiles  and  other  modes  of  personal 
transport,  and  the  privately  owned  vehicle  was  a  relatively  rare 
phenomenon;  therefore,  the  demand  for  road  construction 
was  small.  The  dominance  of  the  railroads  for  cargo  transport 
also  constrained  the  demand  for  the  construction  of  roads.  In 
1995  Russia  had  934,000  kilometers  of  roads,  compared  with 
6.3  million  kilometers  in  the  United  States  (see  fig.  10).  Of  Rus- 
sia's total,  209,000  kilometers  were  unpaved,  and  445,000  kilo- 
meters were  not  available  for  public  use  because  they  served 
specific  industries  or  farms. 

The  World  Bank  has  estimated  that  in  twenty  years  the 
demands  of  Russia's  new  economy  will  increase  the  road  sys- 
tem's share  of  transportation  to  41  percent  from  its  1992  level 
of  13  percent.  However,  in  1992  some  38  percent  of  Russia's 
highway  system  required  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction,  and 
another  25  percent  required  repaving.  Many  major  bridges  also 
required  large-scale  repair  in  the  mid-1990s. 

Railroads 

Railroads  are  the  dominant  mode  of  transportation.  In  1995 
Russia  had  some  154,000  kilometers  of  railroads,  26  percent  of 
which  were  electrified,  but  67,000  kilometers  of  that  total 
served  specific  industries  and  were  not  available  for  general  use 
(see  fig.  11).  The  entire  system  is  1.52-meter  gauge.  In  1993 
railroads  accounted  for  1,608  billion  ton-kilometers  of  cargo 
traffic,  compared  with  the  26  billion  ton-kilometers  provided 
by  trucks.  The  prominence  of  railroads  is  the  result  of  several 
factors:  the  vast  distances  that  need  to  be  covered;  the  pen- 
chant of  Soviet  economic  planners  for  locating  manufacturing 
facilities  in  politically  expedient  areas  rather  than  where  raw 
materials  and  other  inputs  were  available;  and  the  conditions 
for  granting  state  fuel  subsidies,  which  provided  no  incentives 
to  break  up  cargo  transportation  into  shorter-haul  operations 
that  could  be  covered  by  road.  Cargo  traffic  is  the  predominant 
use  of  railroads,  in  contrast  to  the  emphasis  on  passenger  traf- 
fic in  West  European  railroad  systems  (see  table  19;  table  20,

fic in  West  European  railroad  systems  (see  table  19;  table  20, 


359 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Appendix).  This  pattern  is  a  product  of  the  Soviet  emphasis  on 
heavy  industry  and  production  rather  than  on  consumers.  In 

1992  Russia's  railroads  accounted  for  253,000  passenger-kilo- 
meters, and  by  1994  the  total  had  dropped  to  227,000  passen- 
ger-kilometers. 

Railroad  traffic  has  plummeted  since  the  beginning  of  Rus- 
sian economic  reform,  reflecting  a  general  decline  in  eco- 
nomic activity.  Between  1992  and  1994,  freight  haulage 
dropped  from  1.9  million  ton-kilometers  to  1.2  million  ton- 
kilometers,  and  Russia's  rolling  stock  and  roadbeds  deterio- 
rated, mainly  because  of  insufficient  maintenance  funding.  In 

1993  an  estimated  8.5  percent  of  Russian  rail  lines  were  defec- 
tive. As  a  market  economy  takes  shape,  experts  forecast  a 
smaller  relative  role  for  the  railroads.  The  combination  of  fuel 
and  material  costs,  substantially  higher  in  the  absence  of  gov- 
ernment subsidies,  and  new  alternative  routing  will  likely 
prompt  Russian  manufacturers  to  find  more  efficient  means  of 
transporting  goods.  For  shorter  hauls,  trucks  will  replace  rail 
service,  and  intermodal  transportation  will  receive  greater 
emphasis  as  an  outgrowth  of  marketization. 

Air  Transportation 

Of  the  modest  amount  of  passenger  traffic  in  Russia,  air  ser- 
vice accounts  for  a  relatively  large  portion,  although  the  vol- 
ume of  traffic  declined  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s.  In  1990  the 
monopoly  service  of  Aeroflot,  the  Soviet  Union's  state-owned 
airline,  accounted  for  22  percent  of  the  total  distance  passen- 
gers traveled,  a  proportion  comparable  with  the  proportion  of 
travel  on  the  airlines  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  How- 
ever, the  contribution  of  air  service  to  total  travel  had  dropped 
to  12.5  percent  by  1993,  and  the  number  of  passengers  flying 
was  less  than  half  the  1990  total.  Subsidized  air  fares  and  long- 
distance flights  between  cities  accounted  for  much  of  the  air 
activity  in  the  early  1990s.  In  1994  Russia  had  a  total  of  2,517 
airports,  of  which  fifty-four  had  runways  longer  than  3,000 
meters,  202  had  runways  between  2,400  and  3,000  meters,  and 
another  108  had  runways  between  1,500  and  2,400  meters. 

As  with  the  rest  of  the  economy,  air  travel  has  declined  sub- 
stantially as  prices  have  increased  and  travelers'  incomes  have 
declined.  The  airline  industry  also  has  undergone  major 
adjustments  in  the  1990s.  Aeroflot,  since  1995  a  joint-stock 
company  with  majority  state  ownership,  remains  the  main  Rus- 
sian airline.  However,  more  than  200  regional  carriers  have 


360 


The  Economy 


emerged  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  and  most  of  them  are  in 
Russia.  With  flights  from  so  many  carriers,  direct  service  is  now 
available  between  regions,  including  direct  flights  from  the 
Russian  Far  East  to  Japan  and  Alaska,  without  the  previously 
obligatory  stop  in  Moscow  or  St.  Petersburg. 

At  the  same  time  that  airlines  decentralized,  so  did  reserva- 
tion systems  and  navigation  control  networks,  making  those 
aspects  of  airline  travel  less  efficient.  Experts  predict  that  as 
market  forces  continue  to  work  in  the  sector,  higher  fuel  costs 
and  declining  passenger  demand  will  force  mergers  and  bank- 
ruptcies that  eventually  will  lead  to  a  more  efficient  system. 

The  airline  industry  also  must  deal  with  an  aging  capital 
stock.  As  of  1993,  some  48  percent  of  the  national  system's  air- 
craft were  more  than  fifteen  years  old.  To  upgrade,  Russian  air- 
line services  have  purchased  aircraft  from  Western  firms  and 
demanded  more  modern  aircraft  from  domestic  manufactur- 
ers. 

Water  Transportation 

Maritime  transportation  plays  an  important  role  in  Russian 
transit,  but  the  country's  geography  and  climate  limit  the 
capacity  of  shipping.  Many  Russian  rivers  run  from  south  to 
north  rather  than  from  east  to  west,  constraining  their  use  dur- 
ing the  Russian  winters. 

Russia's  major  ports  providing  access  to  the  Baltic  Sea  are  St. 
Petersburg  and  Kaliningrad,  and  Novorossiysk  and  Sochi  are 
the  main  Black  Sea  ports  (see  fig.  12).  Vladivostok,  Nakhodka, 
Magadan,  and  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy  account  for  the  bulk 
of  maritime  transportation  on  the  Pacific  coast.  The  largest 
Arctic  port,  Murmansk,  maintains  an  ice-free  harbor  despite  its 
location  on  the  northern  shore  of  the  Kola  Peninsula.  In  1995 
Russia's  merchant  marine  had  about  800  ships  with  a  gross  ton- 
nage of  more  than  1,000,  of  which  half  are  standard  cargo  ves- 
sels, about  100  oil  tankers,  and  eighty  container  ships.  Russia 
also  owns  235  ships  that  are  over  1,000  tons  and  sail  under  for- 
eign registry.  In  1991  the  merchant  marine  carried  464  million 
tons  of  cargo. 

Navigable  inland  waterways  extend  101,000  kilometers,  of 
which  16,900  kilometers  are  man-made  and  60,400  are  naviga- 
ble at  night.  Boats  of  the  Russian  River  Fleet  do  most  of  the 
inland  shipping,  which  accounted  for  514  million  tons  of  cargo 
in  1991.  The  Russian  government  has  made  efforts  to  decen-

tralize  control  over  water  transportation  and  to  separate  con- 
trol of  liners  from  ports. 

Pipelines 

Natural  gas  and  petroleum  pipelines  play  a  crucial  role  in 
Russia's  economy,  both  in  distributing  fuel  to  domestic  indus- 
trial consumers  and  in  supporting  exports  to  Europe  and  coun- 
tries of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS — see 
Glossary).  Their  complex  network  connects  production 
regions  with  virtually  all  of  Russia's  centers  of  population  and 
industry.  Pipelines  are  especially  important  because  of  the  long 
distances  between  Siberian  oil  and  gas  fields  and  Russia's  Euro- 
pean industrial  centers  as  well  as  countries  to  the  west. 

In  1993  Russia  had  48,000  kilometers  of  pipeline  carrying 
crude  oil,  15,000  kilometers  for  petroleum  products,  and 
140,000  kilometers  for  natural  gas.  In  recent  decades,  the  natu- 
ral gas  lines  have  expanded  at  a  much  faster  rate  than  the 
crude  oil  lines.  The  main  natural  gas  pipeline,  one  of  the 
Soviet  Union's  largest  international  trade  projects,  connects 
the  natural  gas  fields  of  northern  Siberia  with  most  of  the 
countries  of  Western  Europe.  Completed  in  1984,  the  line 
passes  nearly  4,000  kilometers  across  the  Ural  Mountains,  the 
Volga  River,  and  many  other  natural  obstacles  to  connect  Rus- 
sian lines  with  the  European  system. 

Also  completed  in  the  early  1980s,  the  Northern  Lights  natu- 
ral gas  line  runs  from  the  Vuktyl  field  in  the  Republic  of  Komi 
to  Eastern  Europe.  The  Orenburg  pipeline  was  built  in  the  late 
1970s  to  bring  gas  from  the  Orenburg  field  in  Russia  and  the 
Karachaganak  field  in  northern  Kazakstan  to  Eastern  Europe. 

Many  of  Russia's  major  oil  pipelines  parallel  gas  lines.  A 
trunk  oil  line  runs  eastward  from  the  Volga-Ural  fields  to 
Irkutsk  on  Lake  Baikal,  westward  from  those  fields  into 
Ukraine  and  Latvia,  and  southwest  to  connect  with  the  North 
Caucasus  oil  fields  and  refineries;  the  line  is  joined  by  a  line 
from  the  oil  center  at  Surgut  in  the  West  Siberian  Plain. 

Public  Transportation 

Although  the  high  price  and  scarcity  of  passenger  automo- 
biles required  Soviet  citizens  to  rely  on  public  transportation, 
Soviet  policy  makers  gave  low  priority  to  civilian  transportation. 
Only  six  Russian  cities  have  underground  systems — Moscow,  St. 
Petersburg,  Yekaterinburg,  Nizhniy  Novgorod,  Novosibirsk, 
and  Samara.  The  extensive  and  decorative  Moscow  subway  sys- 


364 


The  Economy 


tern,  built  in  the  1930s  as  a  showpiece  of  Stalinist  engineering, 
remains  the  most  reliable  and  inexpensive  means  of  transporta- 
tion in  the  nation's  capital. 

Elsewhere,  buses  are  the  main  form  of  public  transportation. 
In  cities,  tramways  supplement  bus  service,  accounting  for  one- 
third  of  the  passenger-kilometers  that  buses  travel.  The  Russian 
Federation  continues  the  Soviet-era  70  percent  state  subsidy, 
which  keeps  fares  artificially  low.  This  subsidy  has  been  a  drain 
on  the  budget  and  has  blunted  the  public's  demand  for  alter- 
native modes  of  transportation.  The  system's  infrastructure  and 
vehicle  fleets  require  extensive  repair  and  modernization. 

Transportation  Reform 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  market  forces  shifted  some  of 
the  demand  among  the  various  transportation  services.  Rus- 
sian policy  makers  had  not  prescribed  the  proper  role  of  the 
transportation  sector  in  the  new  economy.  However,  officials 
indicated  that  Russia  will  follow  the  Western  model  of  assum- 
ing government  regulation  of  transportation  systems  while 
reducing  state  ownership  of  those  systems. 

Many  state-owned  transportation  monopolies  have  been  dis- 
solved, but  some  monopolies  such  as  public  transportation  are 
expected  to  remain  in  place.  The  role  of  government  will  be  to 
ensure  that  the  systems  are  commercially  viable  and  allow  pri- 
vate systems  to  emerge.  The  government  also  will  continue  to 
be  responsible  for  maintaining  the  quality  and  availability  of 
the  road,  air,  and  water  infrastructure  and  for  maintaining 
standards  of  transportation  safety. 

Telecommunications 

By  various  measures,  Russia's  telecommunications  infrastruc- 
ture is  inferior  to  that  of  most  developed  industrialized  coun- 
tries. In  1991  only  33  percent  of  Russian  households  had 
telephones,  compared  with  94  percent  in  the  United  States.  In 
1995  Russia  had  seventeen  telephone  lines  per  100  inhabitants, 
compared  with  thirty-six  in  Spain,  forty-four  in  Belgium,  and 
sixty-nine  in  Switzerland. 

The  Soviet  Period 

During  the  Soviet  period,  the  state  controlled  all  means  of 
communications  and  used  them  primarily  to  convey  decisions 
and  to  facilitate  the  execution  of  government  directives  affect- 
ing the  economy,  national  security,  and  administrative  govern-

Many  state-owned  transportation  monopolies  have  been  dis- 
solved, but  some  monopolies  such  as  public  transportation  are 
expected  to  remain  in  place.  The  role  of  government  will  be  to 
ensure  that  the  systems  are  commercially  viable  and  allow  pri- 
vate systems  to  emerge.  The  government  also  will  continue  to 
be  responsible  for  maintaining  the  quality  and  availability  of 
the  road,  air,  and  water  infrastructure  and  for  maintaining 
standards  of  transportation  safety. 

Telecommunications 

By  various  measures,  Russia's  telecommunications  infrastruc- 
ture is  inferior  to  that  of  most  developed  industrialized  coun- 
tries. In  1991  only  33  percent  of  Russian  households  had 
telephones,  compared  with  94  percent  in  the  United  States.  In 
1995  Russia  had  seventeen  telephone  lines  per  100  inhabitants, 
compared  with  thirty-six  in  Spain,  forty-four  in  Belgium,  and 
sixty-nine  in  Switzerland. 

The  Soviet  Period 

During  the  Soviet  period,  the  state  controlled  all  means  of 
communications  and  used  them  primarily  to  convey  decisions 
and  to  facilitate  the  execution  of  government  directives  affect- 
ing the  economy,  national  security,  and  administrative  govern-

mental  functions.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  had 
responsibility  for  most  nonmilitary  communications,  and  the 
Ministry  of  Defense  controlled  military  communications. 
Other  ministries,  including  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  controlled 
specialized  elements  of  the  communications  infrastructure. 

Moscow  maintained  control  over  communications,  and 
regional  and  local  jurisdictions  enjoyed  little  autonomy.  This 
centralization  forced  the  Soviet  Union  to  acquire  the  means  to 
deliver  signals  over  a  vast  area  and  provided  the  impetus  for  the 
development  of  satellite  communications,  which  began  with 
the  launching  of  the  Molniya  satellite  communications  system 
in  1965.  Despite  the  success  of  the  satellite  system,  Soviet  tech- 
nology was  unable  to  meet  the  rapidly  growing  informational 
demands  of  the  1980s.  In  that  period,  the  Soviet  government 
began  to  import  digital  switching  equipment  from  the  West  in 
an  effort  to  modernize  the  national  telephone  system.  The  pri- 
ority given  to  military  and  government  applications  skewed  the 
distribution  of  new  equipment,  and  officials  dedicated  rela- 
tively few  telephone  lines  and  communications  facilities  to 
commercial  and  residential  use.  In  addition,  most  communica- 
tions facilities  remained  concentrated  in  a  few  urban  areas  at 
the  expense  of  smaller  cities  and  rural  regions. 

Telecommunications  in  the  1990s 

Since  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Russia  has  been 
engaged  in  the  reorganization  and  modernization  of  its  com- 
munications systems.  In  this  process,  control  over  communica- 
tions has  been  decentralized  and  in  large  part  privatized.  In 
domestic  telephone  and  related  communications,  control 
devolved  to  regional  and  local  enterprises,  which  were  then 
reorganized  into  joint-stock  companies.  Long-distance  and 
international  service  operations  were  grouped  together  into  a 
new  organization,  Russian  Telecommunications  (Rostele- 
kom),  which  itself  became  a  joint-stock  company.  The  federal 
government  has  retained  control  over  the  national  satellite  sys- 
tem, telecommunications  research  and  development,  and  edu- 
cation systems  through  the  Ministry  of  Communications. 
Despite  ownership  changes,  in  1995  only  about  14  percent  of 
Russia's  24.4  million  telephones  were  located  outside  urban 
areas,  the  waiting  list  for  telephone  installation  included  more 
than  10  million  names,  and  only  34,100  pay  telephones  were 
available  for  long-distance  calls.

By  mid-1994  the  Russian  telephone  communications  system 
had  been  privatized  through  the  voucher  program.  Employees 
of  the  reorganized  companies  received  about  25  percent  of 
company  stock,  the  government  retained  some  shares,  and  the 
remainder  were  sold  at  public  auction.  Telecommunications 
stocks  reportedly  have  been  among  the  most  coveted  items  on 
the  fledgling  Russian  stock  market.  Domestic  and  foreign 
investors  have  been  especially  attracted  to  stocks  in  major 
regional  telephone  enterprises  such  as  the  Moscow  and  St. 
Petersburg  telephone  systems  and  Rostelekom.  But  the  state 
has  not  relinquished  its  remaining  telecommunications  shares, 
showing  reluctance  to  cede  full  control  to  the  private  sector. 

Development  of  the  telecommunications  infrastructure 
depends  heavily  on  foreign  funding  and  joint  ventures.  The 
Ministry  of  Communications  expected  foreign  investment  in 
telecommunications  to  increase  by  24  percent  in  1996  over 
1995,  matching  domestic  investment  of  US$520  million.  In  the 
mid-1990s,  state  subsidies  continue  to  fall.  According  to  West- 
ern experts,  that  investment  level  is  far  below  the  amount 
needed  over  a  prolonged  period  to  modernize  Russian  lines  or 
even  to  upgrade  existing  equipment.  However,  Russia  faces  stiff 


369 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

competition  for  foreign  capital  because  Western  and  Japanese 
companies  already  have  made  substantial  commitments  to  tele- 
communications modernization  and  privatization  projects  in  a 
number  of  other  countries. 

Russia's  goals  for  1996  were  the  laying  of  1,815  kilometers  of 
cable  and  the  installation  of  9,500  kilometers  of  wireless  lines, 
5,000  long-distance  exchanges,  and  1.5  million  new  private 
telephone  lines  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  The  latter  addition 
would  bring  the  national  total  to  26  million  lines. 

The  regulatory  framework  for  telecommunications  in  Russia 
remains  weak,  but  it  is  maturing.  The  Law  on  Communica- 
tions, enacted  in  1995,  is  the  chief  statute,  but  the  lines  of  regu- 
latory authority  have  not  been  clearly  defined.  The  Ministry  of 
Communications  is  the  chief  regulatory  agency  for  "civilian" 
communications,  but  military  and  national  security  authorities 
control  their  own  communications  networks  outside  the  pur- 
view of  the  Law  on  Communications. 

As  Russia's  telecommunications  systems  develop,  the  regula- 
tory issues  facing  the  Ministry  of  Communications  include  fre- 
quency assignments,  standardization  of  equipment,  levels  of 
competition,  and  establishment  of  optimal  user  rates.  The  mili- 
tary and  internal  security  agencies  traditionally  have  had  prior- 
ity use  of  most  wireless  frequencies,  but  the  newer  and 
expanding  commercial  and  individual  users  require  more 
access  to  frequencies.  Standardization  is  needed  so  that  older 
equipment  can  operate  with  the  new  models  on  expanded  sys- 
tems. A  uniform  policy  is  needed  for  regulation  of  telecommu- 
nications competition,  which  varied  in  the  early  post-Soviet 
years.  And  the  Ministry  of  Communications  has  not  yet  estab- 
lished telephone  rates  that  are  affordable  to  the  users  but  pro- 
vide enough  profit  for  the  company  to  operate  and  expand. 

The  government  has  promoted  competition  in  some  sectors. 
An  example  is  the  licensing  of  a  number  of  companies  to  pro- 
vide specialized,  dedicated  service  networks.  For  cellular  tele- 
phone lines,  the  government  has  encouraged  competition  in 
densely  populated  areas,  such  as  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg, 
while  developing  single  provider  systems  for  small  areas  where 
demand  is  limited.  For  long-distance  service,  in  the  mid-1990s 
Rostelekom  competed  with  local  telephone  companies  for  rev- 
enues in  the  potentially  lucrative  area  of  interzonal  communi- 
cations. In  addition,  Rostelekom  is  facing  competition  from 
newer  companies  that  are  able  to  provide  long-distance  service 
through  their  own  cables  and  via  satellite.  Under  these  condi- 


370 


The  Economy 


tions,  the  shape  and  size  of  the  Russian  telephone  system  is 
changing  rapidly  and  responding  to  the  demands  of  the  mar- 
ket. 

Experts  estimate  that  Russia  must  expand  its  telephone  net- 
works from  around  24  million  telephones  to  between  75  mil- 
lion and  80  million  and  provide  the  modern  switching 
equipment  with  which  they  can  operate.  They  further  expect 
that  Russia  will  require  an  investment  of  US$150  billion  to 
bring  its  telephone  system  up  to  modern  standards.  Russia  has 
imported  Western  equipment  in  the  modernization  effort,  but 
this  strategy  has  proved  very  costly.  The  Russian  equipment 
industry  is  trying  to  revive  itself  and  develop  indigenous  tech- 
nology to  fulfill  its  needs. 

Foreign  investors  could  be  an  important  source  of  capital 
and  technology  in  the  Russian  telecommunications  sector,  but 
in  the  mid-1990s  Russian  laws  and  regulations  limited  foreign 
participation  to  the  supply  of  equipment  and  services  that 
would  not  hurt  domestic  producers.  The  Law  on  Communica- 
tions gives  preference  to  domestically  produced  equipment, 
with  the  major  exception  of  cellular  phone  production,  where 
officials  have  welcomed  foreign  participation.  Domestic  tele- 
phone services  are  the  domain  of  Russian  companies,  but  for- 
eign companies  have  established  a  presence  in  domestic  and 
international  long-distance  service. 

Russian  radio  and  television  are  undergoing  similar  changes 
(see  The  Broadcast  Media,  ch.  7).  The  programming  facilities 
and  transmission  operations  are  separate,  as  they  were  in  the 
Soviet  system  when  the  central  government  controlled  all  of 
these  facilities.  After  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Russian 
radio  and  television  programming  operations  were  decentral- 
ized at  the  regional  and  local  levels. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  three  major  countrywide  state-owned  pro- 
gramming companies  provide  most  programming  for  the 
country.  They  are  Russian  Public  Television  (Obshchestven- 
noye  rossiyskoye  televideniye — ORT),  Russian  State  Television, 
and  St.  Petersburg  Television,  which  primarily  serves  the  St. 
Petersburg  metropolitan  area.  In  1995  Russian  State  Television 
was  partially  privatized  when  49  percent  of  its  shares  were  sold 
to  private  companies,  but  the  company  remains  under  state 
control. 

The  privatization  process  moved  large  blocks  of  shares  into 
the  hands  of  banks  and  powerful  entrepreneurs,  who  formed 
communications  and  newspaper  empires  and  used  close  con- 


371 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

nections  in  the  Government  to  lobby  for  the  release  of  addi- 
tional state  shares  in  the  broadcasting  enterprises.  In  1996  the 
two  most  powerful  broadcast  entrepreneurs  were  former 
banker  Vladimir  Gusinskiy,  head  of  the  Media-Most  holding 
company  including  the  Independent  Television  (Nezavisimoye 
televideniye — NTV)  network  and  several  prominent  periodi- 
cals, and  Boris  Berezovskiy,  an  automobile  entrepreneur  whose 
organization,  Logovaz,  now  controls  ORT  as  well  as  banking, 
oil,  aviation,  and  print  media  enterprises. 

Privately  owned  and  operated,  independent  programming 
companies  are  playing  a  growing  role  in  Russian  radio  and  tele- 
vision programming.  As  of  1995,  some  800  companies  were  in 
existence.  In  1996  the  largest  private  television  channels  are 
TV-6,  which  reaches  sixty  cities  in  Russia  and  elsewhere  with  a 
potential  audience  of  600  million  viewers,  and  NTV,  which 
serves  European  Russia  and  has  a  potential  audience  of  100 
million  viewers.  Both  companies  were  founded  in  1993. 

Transmission  facilities  are  state-owned,  and  programmers 
must  pay  fees  to  the  transmission  companies  to  have  their 
material  broadcast.  The  fee  establishment  mechanism  remains 
an  issue  in  Russian  telecommunications  policy.  Control  over 
transmission  gives  the  government  powerful  leverage  over  the 
content  of  broadcasts.  In  1996  independent  companies  were 
considering  cable  and  direct  satellite  television  services  to  get 
into  the  state-dominated  market  as  transmission  providers.  In 
1992  some  48.5  million  radios  and  54.9  million  televisions  were 
in  use. 

Because  the  Law  on  Communications  does  not  address  the 
question  of  airtime  allocation,  policy  makers  also  must  grapple 
with  that  issue.  Subsidies  for  radio  and  television  broadcasters, 
including  state-owned  operations,  have  been  reduced  drasti- 
cally in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  meaning  that  programmers 
must  rely  on  advertising  revenues. 

Foreign  Economic  Relations 

Integrating  the  Russian  economy  with  the  rest  of  the  world 
through  commerce  and  expanded  foreign  investment  has  been 
a  high  priority  of  Russian  economic  reform.  Russia  has  joined 
the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  and  has  applied  to  join  the  World 
Trade  Organization  (WTO — see  Glossary)  and  the  OECD.  It 
also  has  been  included  in  some  functions  of  the  Group  of 
Seven  (G-7;  see  Glossary).

Foreign  Trade 

By  the  end  of  1993,  the  Russian  government  had  liberalized 
much  of  its  import  regime.  It  eliminated  nontariff  customs  bar- 
riers on  most  imports,  although  it  still  requires  some  licenses 
for  health  and  safety  reasons.  In  mid-1992  the  government 
took  control  of  imports  of  some  critical  goods,  including  indus- 
trial equipment  and  food  items,  which  it  sold  to  end  users  at 
subsidized  prices.  In  the  early  1990s,  government-controlled 
imports  constituted  about  40  percent  of  total  Russian  imports, 
but  by  1996  most  such  controls  had  been  phased  out. 

Russia  also  established  a  two-column  tariff  regime  in  har- 
mony with  the  United  States  and  other  members  of  the  Gene- 
ral Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT),  which  in  January 
1995  became  the  WTO.  Russia  differentiates  between  those 
trade  partners  that  receive  most-favored-nation  trade  treatment 
and,  therefore,  relatively  low  tariffs,  and  those  that  do  not. 

Although  Russia  has  eliminated  many  nontariff  import  barri- 
ers, it  still  maintains  high  tariffs  and  other  duties  on  imports  of 
goods  to  raise  revenue  and  protect  domestic  producers.  All 
imports  are  subject  to  a  3  percent  special  tax  in  addition  to 
import  tariffs  that  vary  with  the  category  of  goods.  Some  of  the 


373 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

high  tariffs  include  those  of  40  to  50  percent  on  automobiles 
and  aircraft  and  100  percent  on  alcoholic  beverages.  Excise 
taxes  ranging  between  35  and  250  percent  are  applied  to  cer- 
tain luxury  goods  that  include  automobiles,  jewelry,  alcohol, 
and  cigarettes. 

The  Government  has  used  licensing  and  quotas  to  restrict 
the  export  of  certain  key  commodities,  such  as  oil  and  oil  prod- 
ucts, to  ease  the  effect  of  price  differentials  between  controlled 
domestic  prices  and  world  market  prices.  Without  such  restric- 
tions, Russian  policy  makers  have  argued,  the  domestic  market 
would  experience  shortages  of  critical  materials.  The  govern- 
ment finally  eliminated  quotas  on  oil  exports  in  1995  and 
export  taxes  on  oil  in  1996.  In  addition  to  customs  restrictions, 
the  government  imposes  other  costs  on  exporters.  It  charges  a 
20  percent  VAT  on  most  cash-transaction  exports  and  a  30  per- 
cent VAT  on  barter  transactions.  It  applies  additional  tariffs  on 
the  exports  of  industrial  raw  materials.  By  the  mid-1990s,  much 
of  Russia's  foreign  trade,  even  that  with  the  former  communist 
countries  of  Central  Europe,  was  conducted  on  the  basis  of 
market-determined  prices.  Immediately  after  the  dissolution  of 
the  Soviet-dominated  Comecon  in  1991,  the  Soviet  Union 
sought  to  maintain  commercial  relations  in  Central  Europe 
through  bilateral  agreements.  But  as  market  economies  devel- 
oped in  those  countries,  their  governments  lost  control  over 
trade  flows.  Since  1993  Russian  trade  with  former  Comecon 
member  countries  has  been  at  world  prices  and  in  hard  curren- 
cies. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  Russia  still  maintained  hybrid  trade 
regimes  with  the  other  former  Soviet  states,  reflecting  the  web 
of  economic  interdependence  that  had  dominated  commercial 
relations  within  the  Soviet  Union.  The  sharp  decrease  in  cen- 
tral economic  control  that  occurred  just  before  and  after  the 
breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  virtually  destroyed  distribution 
channels  between  suppliers  and  producers  and  between  pro- 
ducers and  consumers  throughout  the  region.  Many  of  the 
non-Russian  republics  were  dependent  on  Russian  oil  and  nat- 
ural gas,  timber,  and  other  raw  materials.  Russia  bought  food 
and  other  consumer  goods  from  some  of  the  other  Soviet 
republics.  To  ease  the  effects  of  the  transition,  Russia  con- 
cluded bilateral  agreements  with  the  other  former  Soviet  states 
to  maintain  the  flow  of  goods.  But,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Central 
European  agreements,  such  arrangements  proved  impractical; 
by  the  mid-1990s,  they  covered  only  a  small  range  of  goods.

The  Economy 


Russia  now  conducts  trade  with  former  Soviet  states  under  vari- 
ous regimes,  including  free-trade  arrangements  and  most- 
favored-nation  trading  status. 

The  volume  of  Russia's  foreign  trade  has  generally  declined 
since  the  beginning  of  the  economic  transition.  Trade  volume 
peaked  in  1990  and  then  declined  sharply  in  1991  and  1992. 
Between  1992  and  1995,  however,  exports  rose  from  US$39.7 
billion  to  US$77.8  billion,  and  imports  rose  from  US$34.7  bil- 
lion to  US$57.9  billion.  Many  factors  contributed  to  the 
decline  of  the  early  1990s:  the  collapse  of  Comecon  and  trade 
relations  with  Eastern/Central  Europe;  the  rapid  decline  of  the 
domestic  demand  for  imports;  contraction  in  foreign  currency 
reserves;  a  decline  in  the  real  exchange  value  of  the  ruble;  the 
Government's  imposition  of  high  tariffs,  VATs,  and  excess  taxes 
on  imports;  and  the  reduction  of  state  subsidies  on  some  key 
imports.  Russia's  declining  production  of  crude  oil,  a  key 
export,  also  has  contributed  significantly.  Until  1994  Russia's 
arms  exports  declined  sharply  because  the  military-industrial 
complex's  production  fell  and  international  sanctions  were 
placed  on  large-scale  customers  such  as  Iraq  and  Libya  (see 
Foreign  Arms  Sales,  ch.  9) . 

The  geographical  distribution  of  Russian  foreign  trade 
changed  radically  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  (see  table  21; 
table  22,  Appendix).  In  1985  some  55  percent  of  Soviet  exports 
and  54  percent  of  Soviet  imports  were  with  the  Comecon  coun- 
tries. By  contrast,  26  percent  of  Soviet  exports  and  28  percent 
of  Soviet  imports  were  with  the  fully  developed  market  econo- 
mies of  Western  Europe,  Japan,  the  United  States,  and  Canada. 
By  the  end  of  1991,  Russia  and  its  former  allies  of  Central 
Europe  were  actively  seeking  new  markets.  In  1991  only  23  per- 
cent of  Russian  exports  and  24  percent  of  Russian  imports  were 
with  the  former  Comecon  member  states.  In  1994  some  2V  per- 
cent of  Russian  imports  and  22  percent  of  exports  involved 
partners  from  Central  Europe,  with  Poland,  Hungary,  and  the 
Czech  Republic  generating  the  largest  volume  in  both  direc- 
tions. Western  Europe's  share  of  Russian  trade  continued  to 
grow,  and  in  1994  some  35  percent  of  Russia's  imports  and  36 
percent  of  its  exports  were  with  countries  in  that  region.  Ger- 
many was  by  far  the  West  European  leader  in  exports  and 
imports,  and  Switzerland  and  Britain  were  other  large  export 
customers.  In  1994  the  United  States  accounted  for  US$2.1  bil- 
lion (5.3  percent)  of  imports  and  US$3.7  billion  (5.9  percent) 
of  exports;  however,  United  States  purchases  of  Russian  goods 


375 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

had  increased  by  more  than  500  percent  between  1992  and 
1994.  The  total  value  of  trade  with  the  United  States  in  1995 
was  US$7  billion;  trade  for  the  first  half  of  1996  proceeded  at 
virtually  the  same  rate  (see  table  23,  Appendix). 

Russian  trade  with  the  so-called  near  abroad — the  other 
former  Soviet  states — has  greatly  deteriorated.  This  trend 
began  before  the  final  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  as  Russian 
producers  sought  hard-currency  markets  for  raw  materials  and 
other  exportables.  As  Russia  raised  fuel  prices  closer  to  world 
market  levels,  the  other  republics  found  it  increasingly  difficult 
to  pay  for  Russian  oil  and  natural  gas.  The  RCB  extended  cred- 
its to  these  countries  to  permit  some  shipments,  but  eventually 
the  accumulation  of  large  arrearages  forced  the  Russian  gov- 
ernment to  curtail  shipments.  At  the  end  of  1995,  Russian 
trade  with  the  near  abroad  accounted  for  17  percent  of  total 
Russian  trade,  down  from  59  percent  in  1991.  Belarus,  Kazak- 
stan,  and  Ukraine  remained  Russia's  largest  partners,  as  they 
had  been  in  the  Soviet  era.  The  failure  to  restore  inter-republic 
trade  was  an  important  factor  in  the  economic  collapse  that 
gripped  the  region  around  1990. 

Raw  materials,  especially  oil,  natural  gas,  metals,  and  miner- 
als, have  dominated  Russia's  exports,  accounting  for  65  percent 
of  total  exports  in  1993.  Exports  as  a  whole  are  heavily  concen- 
trated in  a  few  product  categories.  In  1995  ten  commodities,  all 
of  which  are  raw  materials,  accounted  for  70  percent  of  Russian 
exports.  By  contrast,  for  the  United  States  the  top  ten  export 
commodities  account  for  only  37  percent  of  its  exports. 

The  lack  of  diversity  in  Russian  exports  is  a  legacy  of  the 
Soviet  period,  when  the  central  planning  regime  called  for  pro- 
duction of  manufactured  goods  for  domestic  consumption 
with  little  consideration  for  the  export  market.  Given  this  pri- 
ority, most  of  the  Soviet  Union's  consumer  goods  were  of  low 
quality  by  world  standards.  Post-Soviet  concentration  of  Rus- 
sian exportables  in  a  few  categories  restricts  Russia's  potential 
sources  of  foreign  currency  to  a  few  markets.  And  the  frequent 
price  fluctuations  typical  of  world  raw  materials  markets  also 
make  Russia's  export  revenues  vulnerable  to  unforeseen 
change. 

Manufactured  goods  dominate  Russian  imports,  accounting 
for  68  percent  of  total  imports  in  1992.  The  largest  categories 
of  imported  manufactured  goods  are  machinery  and  equip- 
ment (29  percent  of  the  total);  foods,  16  percent;  and  textiles 
and  shoes,  13  percent.

The  Economy 


Foreign  Investment 

Foreign  investment  is  the  second  major  element  of  Russia's 
reform  strategy  to  strengthen  international  economic  links. 
From  the  late  1920s  to  the  late  1980s,  the  Soviet  government 
prohibited  foreign  investment  because  it  would  have  under- 
mined the  state's  decision-making  prerogatives  on  investment, 
production,  and  consumption. 

The  perestroika  economic  reforms  of  the  late  1980s  permitted 
limited  foreign  investment  in  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  form  of 
joint  ventures.  The  first  joint-venture  law,  which  went  into 
effect  in  June  1987,  restricted  foreign  ownership  to  49  percent 
of  the  venture  and  required  that  Soviet  administrators  fill  the 
positions  of  chairman  and  general  manager.  By  1991,  however, 
the  Soviet  government  allowed  foreign  entities  100  percent 
ownership  of  subsidiaries  in  Russia. 

Although  limited  in  scope,  the  joint-venture  law  did  open 
the  door  to  direct  foreign  investment  in  the  Soviet  Union, 
which  provided  Russia's  economy  wider  access  to  Western  capi- 
tal, technology,  and  management  know-how.  But  the  overall 
limitations  of  perestroika  hampered  the  joint-venture  program. 
The  nonconvertibility  of  the  Russian  ruble  was  an  impediment 
to  repatriation  of  profits  by  foreign  investors,  private  property 
was  not  recognized,  government  price  controls  remained  in 
effect,  and  most  of  the  Soviet  economy  remained  under  state 
control. 

The  Yeltsin  government's  commitment  to  foreign  invest- 
ment has  been  hampered  in  some  cases  by  Russia's  ongoing 
debates  about  the  appropriate  relationship  with  the  West  and 
about  the  amount  of  assistance  that  Russia  should  accept  from 
the  capitalist  countries.  Substantial  political  factions  view  the 
infusion  of  foreign  capital  as  a  device  for  Western  governments 
to  intrude  on  Russia's  sovereignty  and  manipulate  its  economic 
condition,  and  they  advocate  a  more  independent  course. 

The  Foreign  Investment  Law  of  1991  provides  the  statutory 
foundation  for  the  treatment  of  foreign  investment.  The  law 
provides  for  "national  treatment"  of  foreign  investments;  that 
is,  foreign  investors  and  investments  are  to  be  treated  no  less 
favorably  than  domestically  based  investments.  The  law  also 
permits  foreign  investment  in  most  sectors  of  the  Russian  econ- 
omy and  in  all  the  forms  available  in  the  Russian  economy: 
portfolios  of  government  securities,  stocks,  and  bonds,  and 
direct  investment  in  new  businesses,  in  the  acquisition  of  exist- 
ing Russian-owned  enterprises,  in  joint  ventures,  in  property 


377

acquisition,  and  in  leasing  the  rights  to  natural  resources.  For- 
eign investors  are  protected  against  nationalization  or  expro- 
priation unless  the  government  declares  that  such  a  procedure 
is  necessary  in  the  public  interest.  In  such  cases,  foreign  inves- 
tors are  to  receive  just  compensation. 

In  response  to  demands  by  foreign  oil  investors  for  stronger 
legal  guarantees  before  making  large  capital  commitments,  in 
July  1995  the  State  Duma  passed  the  Law  on  Oil  and  Gas.  It 
provides  a  basic  framework  for  other  laws  and  regulations  per- 
taining to  exploration,  production,  transportation,  and  secu- 
rity of  oil  and  gas.  In  late  1995,  the  Duma  passed  the 
Production-Sharing  Agreement  bill,  which  provides  for  foreign 
investors  to  share  output  with  domestic  partners.  Among  other 
things,  the  bill  lifts  many  of  the  financial  impediments  by 
removing  excise  and  customs  duties  on  the  exportation  of  oil 
by  joint  ventures,  and  it  requires  contract  sanctity  for  the  life  of 
the  project.  But  in  a  clause  that  drew  criticism  from  the  United 
States  business  community,  the  bill  requires  State  Duma 
approval  of  new  joint-venture  agreements  on  a  case-by-case 
basis.  As  of  mid-1996,  the  United  States  Department  of  Com- 
merce considered  the  Duma's  veto  power  over  such  agree- 
ments a  key  obstacle  to  expanded  United  States  investment  in 
Russia. 

By  the  end  of  1995,  foreign  investment  in  Russia  since  1991 
had  totaled  an  estimated  US$6  billion,  a  small  amount  consid- 
ering the  size  of  the  Russian  economy.  Of  that  amount,  US$3.2 
billion  had  been  invested  between  1991  and  1993  and  US$1  bil- 
lion in  1994.  Of  the  approximately  US$2  billion  invested  in 
1995,  about  28  percent  came  from  the  United  States,  13  per- 
cent from  Germany,  9  percent  from  Switzerland,  and  6  percent 
from  Belgium.  By  sector,  15  percent  of  1995  investments  went 
to  trade  and  catering;  13  percent  to  finance,  insurance,  and 
pensions;  10  percent  to  the  fuel  industries;  and  8  percent  to 
chemical  industries.  Telecommunications,  food  processing  and 
agriculture,  pharmaceuticals  and  medical  equipment,  and 
housing  are  in  particular  need  of  additional  foreign  invest- 
ment. 

Russia's  overall  investment  climate  has  not  been  robust 
because  of  high  inflation,  a  plunging  GDP,  an  unstable 
exchange  rate,  an  uncertain  legal  and  political  environment, 
and  the  capricious  enactment  and  implementation  of  tax  and 
regulatory  regimes.  Nevertheless,  experts  predict  that  improve- 


378 


The  Economy 


ment  in  those  conditions  will  bring  a  strong  increase  in  foreign 
activity. 

Foreign  Debt 

Russia  inherited  a  large  foreign  debt  burden  from  the  Soviet 
Union  that  clouds  its  economic  situation.  Throughout  its  his- 
tory, the  Soviet  Union  was  a  conservative  borrower  of  foreign 
credits.  Its  ability  to  manage  international  accounts  allowed  the 
Soviet  Union  to  obtain  both  government-guaranteed  and  com- 
mercial credits  on  favorable  terms.  But,  by  the  end  of  the 
1980s,  the  Soviet  hard-currency  debt  had  increased  apprecia- 
bly. At  the  end  of  1991,  the  debt  was  estimated  at  US$65  billion, 
an  increase  of  over  100  percent  since  the  end  of  1986. 

By  arrangement  with  the  other  former  Soviet  states  and  its 
creditors,  Russia  accepted  responsibility  for  repayment  of  the 
Soviet  Union's  entire  debt,  in  exchange  for  control  of  some  of 
the  overseas  assets  of  the  other  republics.  In  January  1996,  Rus- 
sia's total  foreign  debt  was  US$120.4  billion,  including  US$103 
billion  of  the  Soviet  Union's  debt  that  Russia  assumed.  Russia 
has  been  hard  pressed  to  service  that  amount. 

In  March  1996,  the  IMF  approved  a  three-year  loan  of 
US$10.1  billion  to  Russia.  At  that  point,  Russia  already  had 
US$10.8  billion  in  outstanding  IMF  debts.  The  first  loan  pay- 
ment of  US$340  million  was  paid  almost  immediately,  and  it 
helped  Russia  to  overcome  a  large  budget  deficit  that  it  had 
been  trying  to  cover  by  issuing  securities.  The  IMF  made  the 
early  monthly  payments  of  the  loan  during  Russia's  1996  presi- 
dential election  campaign,  despite  Russia's  failure  to  comply 
with  several  loan  requirements.  However,  once  Yeltsin  had 
been  reelected,  the  IMF  withheld  the  July  payment  because 
Russia's  hard-currency  reserves  had  been  severely  depleted 
during  the  campaign  and  the  tax  collection  system  remained 
unsatisfactory. 

In  April  1996,  the  Paris  Club  of  seventeen  lending  nations 
agreed  to  the  largest  debt  rescheduling  procedure  in  the  his- 
tory of  the  organization  by  postponing  US$40  billion  of  Rus- 
sian debt  in  order  to  assist  Russia  in  meeting  its  international 
debt  payments.  The  agreement  followed  the  November  1995 
provisional  accord  with  the  London  Club  of  international  com- 
mercial bank  lenders  (which  spread  repayment  of  US$32.5  bil- 
lion over  a  twenty-five-year  period)  and  the  IMF  loan  of 
US$10.1  billion  in  March  1996.  The  new  schedule  gave  Russia  a 
six-year  grace  period  for  repayment  on  the  principal  it  owes.

The  Economic  Outlook 

In  the  first  half-decade  after  the  end  of  the  Soviet  Union, 
Russia  made  significant  strides  in  restructuring  its  economy 
and  providing  an  environment  for  the  operation  of  market 
forces  rather  than  state  control  as  the  fundamental  principle  of 
the  economic  system.  By  1995  more  than  half  of  the  recorded 
GDP  came  from  the  private  sector,  with  considerable  unre- 
ported private  activity  also  contributing  to  the  vitality  of  the 
economy.  Almost  all  prices  are  now  market  determined.  Most 
of  Russia's  state  enterprises  have  been  placed  under  some 
degree  of  private  control,  although  many  continue  to  operate 
in  much  the  same  way  as  before  privatization.  By  making  the 
ruble  convertible  in  foreign  trade  and  other  current-account 
transactions,  Russia  has  accelerated  the  integration  of  its  econ- 
omy with  those  of  the  rest  of  the  world. 

These  strides  have  come  at  a  cost,  however.  The  Russian 
economy  has  endured  a  severe  contraction  that  experts  predict 
will  not  end  before  late  1996  or  1997.  Many  Russians  are  expe- 
riencing the  new  and  disillusioning  phenomenon  of  unem- 
ployment as  the  growing  private  sector  slowly  absorbs  an 
increasingly  large  labor  pool  jettisoned  in  the  restructuring  of 
the  state  sector.  Many,  particularly  those  of  middle  age,  are 
finding  it  difficult  to  adjust  to  the  loss  of  the  cradle-to-grave 
social  safety  net  of  the  Soviet  system.  The  gap  between  Russia's 
"haves"  and  "have-nots,"  which  is  determined  by  the  possession 
of  skills,  audacity,  and  connections  needed  to  be  successful 
under  the  new  economic  system,  widened  alarmingly  in  the 
mid-1990s. 

Despite  major  problems,  Russia  is  not  likely  to  turn  back  the 
clock  on  economic  reform,  although  periodic  slowdowns  are 
likely  to  recur.  Western  experts  consider  the  results  of  the 
June-July  1996  presidential  elections  an  encouraging  sign  that 
the  government  will  not  leave  the  path  of  conversion  upon 
which  Yeltsin  embarked  in  1990.  But  Russia's  market  economy 
remains  partially  formed,  with  some  parts  far  advanced  and 
others  lagging  behind.  Critical,  unfilled  needs  include  the  fol- 
lowing: substantial  improvement  in  the  taxation  system,  which 
is  poorly  enforced  and  fails  to  encourage  private  initiative  or 
foreign  investment;  a  comprehensive  rather  than  a  piecemeal 
set  of  commercial  laws  to  establish  consistent  business  condi- 
tions; continued  reform  of  the  banking  system,  including 
removal  of  corrupt  elements  and  ineffectual  commercial 
banks;  continuation  of  meaningful  privatization,  including 


380 


The  Economy 

reform  of  voucher  distribution,  expansion  of  the  entrepreneur- 
ial class,  and  restoration  of  public  confidence  in  privatization 
as  more  than  redistribution  of  wealth  among  the  entrepreneur- 
ial elite;  continued  government  spending  discipline  (some- 
thing forsaken  completely  during  Yeltsin's  1996  campaign)  to 
keep  exchange  rates,  budget  deficits,  and  inflation  under  con- 
trol; establishment  of  agencies  to  promote  trade  and  distribute 
information;  and  wage  reform  to  ensure  timely  payment  and 
gradually  relieve  the  intense  social  pressure  caused  by  the 
increase  of  the  have-not  part  of  Russia's  population. 

Yeltsin's  appointment  of  reform  economist  Anatoliy  Ghubays 
as  his  chief  of  staff  in  July  1996  was  a  signal  that  the  advocates 
of  strong  reform  might  overcome  the  factions  that  had  blocked 
or  weakened  reform  legislation  in  the  State  Duma.  But  political 
battles  will  continue  over  the  speed  and  wisdom  of  market-ori- 
ented reform  because  strong  vested  interests  continue  to  advo- 
cate state  control  of  remaining  economic  assets,  or  even 
reassumption  of  state  control  of  privatized  assets.  As  the  first 
five  years  have  demonstrated,  the  road  to  economic  reform  in 
Russia  is  not  straight  or  short,  but,  given  continued  outside 
assistance  and  political  stability,  the  chances  of  further  progress 
seem  reasonably  good.

SINCE  GAINING  ITS  INDEPENDENCE  with  the  collapse  of 
the  Soviet  Union  at  the  end  of  1991,  Russia  (formally,  the  Rus- 
sian Federation)  has  faced  serious  challenges  in  its  efforts  to 
forge  a  political  system  to  follow  nearly  seventy-five  years  of 
centralized,  totalitarian  rule.  For  instance,  leading  figures  in 
the  legislative  and  executive  branches  have  put  forth  opposing 
views  of  Russia's  political  direction  and  the  governmental 
instruments  that  should  be  used  to  follow  it.  That  conflict 
reached  a  climax  in  September  and  October  1993,  when  Presi- 
dent Boris  N.  Yeltsin  used  military  force  to  dissolve  the  parlia- 
ment and  called  for  new  legislative  elections.  This  event 
marked  the  end  of  Russia's  first  constitutional  period,  which 
was  defined  by  the  much-amended  constitution  adopted  by  the 
Russian  Republic  in  1978.  A  new  constitution,  creating  a  strong 
presidency,  was  approved  by  referendum  in  December  1993. 

With  a  new  constitution  and  a  new  parliament  representing 
diverse  parties  and  factions,  Russia's  political  structure  subse- 
quently showed  signs  of  stabilization.  However,  since  that  time 
Russians  have  continued  to  debate  the  future  of  their  political 
system,  with  Western-style  democracy  and  authoritarianism 
being  two  widely  considered  alternatives.  As  the  transition 
period  extended  into  the  mid-1990s,  the  power  of  the  national 
government  continued  to  wane  as  Russia's  regions  gained  polit- 
ical and  economic  concessions  from  Moscow.  Although  the 
struggle  between  the  executive  and  the  legislative  branches  was 
partially  resolved  by  the  new  constitution,  the  two  branches 
continued  to  represent  fundamentally  opposing  visions  of  Rus- 
sia's future.  The  executive  was  the  center  of  reform,  and  the 
lower  house  of  the  parliament,  the  State  Duma,  was  a  bastion  of 
antireform  communists  and  nationalists. 

Historical  Background 

The  Soviet  Union  formally  came  into  being  under  the  treaty 
of  union  in  December  1922,  which  was  signed  by  Russia  and 
three  other  union  republics — Belorussia  (now  Belarus), 
Ukraine,  and  what  was  then  the  Transcaucasian  Soviet  Feder- 
ated Socialist  Republic  (an  entity  including  Armenia,  Azer- 
baijan, and  Georgia).  Under  the  treaty,  Russia  became  known 
officially  as  the  Russian  Soviet  Federated  Socialist  Republic 


385 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


(RSFSR).  The  treaty  of  union  was  incorporated  into  the  first 
Soviet  constitution,  which  was  promulgated  in  1924.  Nomi- 
nally, the  borders  of  each  subunit  were  drawn  to  incorporate 
the  territory  of  a  specific  nationality.  The  constitution  endowed 
the  new  republics  with  sovereignty,  although  they  were  said  to 
have  voluntarily  delegated  most  of  their  sovereign  powers  to 
the  Soviet  center.  Formal  sovereignty  was  evidenced  by  the 
existence  of  flags,  constitutions,  and  other  state  symbols,  and 
by  the  republics'  constitutionally  guaranteed  "right"  to  secede 
from  the  union.  Russia  was  the  largest  of  the  union  republics  in 
terms  of  territory  and  population.  Ethnic  Russians  dominated 
Soviet  politics  and  government;  they  also  controlled  local 
administration. 

Because  of  the  Russians'  dominance  in  the  affairs  of  the 
union,  the  RSFSR  failed  to  develop  some  of  the  institutions  of 
governance  and  administration  that  were  typical  of  public  life 
in  the  other  republics:  a  republic-level  communist  party,  a  Rus- 
sian academy  of  sciences,  and  Russian  branches  of  trade 
unions,  for  example.  As  the  titular  nationalities  of  the  other 
fourteen  union  republics  began  to  call  for  greater  republic 
rights  in  the  late  1980s,  however,  ethnic  Russians  also  began  to 
demand  the  creation  or  strengthening  of  various  specifically 
Russian  institutions  in  the  RSFSR.  Certain  policies  of  Soviet 
leader  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in  office  1985-91)  also  encour- 
aged nationalities  in  the  union  republics,  including  the  Rus- 
sian Republic,  to  assert  their  rights.  These  policies  included 
glasnost  (literally,  public  voicing — see  Glossary),  which  made 
possible  open  discussion  of  democratic  reforms  and  long- 
ignored  public  problems  such  as  pollution.  Glasnost  also 
brought  constitutional  reforms  that  led  to  the  election  of  new 
republic  legislatures  with  substantial  blocs  of  pro-reform  repre- 
sentatives. 

In  Russia  a  new  legislature,  called  the  Congress  of  People's 
Deputies,  was  elected  in  March  1990  in  a  largely  free  and  com- 
petitive vote.  Upon  convening  in  May,  the  congress  elected 
Boris  N.  Yeltsin,  a  onetime  Gorbachev  protege  who  had  been 
exiled  from  the  top  party  echelon  because  of  his  radical  reform 
proposals,  as  president  of  the  congress's  permanent  working 
body,  the  Supreme  Soviet.  The  next  month,  the  congress 
declared  Russia's  sovereignty  over  its  natural  resources  and  the 
primacy  of  Russia's  laws  over  those  of  the  central  Soviet  govern- 
ment. During  1990-91,  the  RSFSR  enhanced  its  sovereignty  by 
establishing  republic  branches  of  organizations  such  as  the 


386 


Government  and  Politics 


communist  party,  the  Academy  of  Sciences  (see  Glossary)  of 
the  Soviet  Union,  radio  and  television  broadcasting  facilities, 
and  the  Committee  for  State  Security  (Komitet  gosudarstven- 
noy  bezopasnosti — KGB;  see  Glossary).  In  1991  Russia  created 
a  new  executive  office,  the  presidency,  following  the  example 
of  Gorbachev,  who  had  created  such  an  office  for  himself  in 
1990.  Russia  held  a  popular  election  that  conferred  legitimacy 
on  the  office,  whereas  Gorbachev  had  eschewed  such  an  elec- 
tion and  had  himself  appointed  by  the  Soviet  parliament. 
Despite  Gorbachev's  attempts  to  discourage  Russia's  electorate 
from  voting  for  him,  Yeltsin  was  popularly  elected  as  president 
in  June  1991,  handily  defeating  five  other  candidates  with 
more  than  57  percent  of  the  vote. 

Yeltsin  used  his  role  as  president  to  trumpet  Russian  sover- 
eignty and  patriotism,  and  his  legitimacy  as  president  was  a 
major  cause  of  the  collapse  of  the  coup  by  hard-line  govern- 
ment and  party  officials  against  Gorbachev  in  August  1991.  The 
coup  leaders  had  attempted  to  overthrow  Gorbachev  in  order 
to  halt  his  plan  to  sign  a  confederation  treaty  that  they  believed 
would  wreck  the  Soviet  Union.  Yeltsin  defiantly  opposed  the 
coup  plotters  and  called  for  Gorbachev's  restoration,  rallying 
the  Russian  public.  Most  important,  Yeltsin's  opposition  led  ele- 
ments in  the  "power  ministries"  that  controlled  the  military, 
the  police,  and  the  KGB  to  refuse  to  obey  the  orders  of  the 
coup  plotters.  The  opposition  led  by  Yeltsin,  combined  with 
the  irresolution  of  the  plotters,  caused  the  coup  to  collapse 
after  three  days. 

Following  the  failed  coup,  Gorbachev  found  a  fundamen- 
tally changed  constellation  of  power,  with  Yeltsin  in  de  facto 
control  of  much  of  a  sometimes  recalcitrant  Soviet  administra- 
tive apparatus.  Although  Gorbachev  returned  to  his  position  as 
Soviet  president,  events  began  to  bypass  him.  Communist  party 
activities  were  suspended.  Most  of  the  union  republics  quickly 
declared  their  independence,  although  many  appeared  willing 
to  sign  Gorbachev's  vaguely  delineated  confederation  treaty. 
The  Baltic  states  achieved  full  independence,  and  they  quickly 
received  diplomatic  recognition  from  many  nations.  Gor- 
bachev's rump  government  recognized  the  independence  of 
Estonia,  Latvia,  and  Lithuania  in  August  and  September  1991. 

In  late  1991,  the  Yeltsin  government  assumed  budgetary 
control  over  Gorbachev's  rump  government.  Russia  did  not 
declare  its  independence,  and  Yeltsin  continued  to  hope  that 
some  form  of  confederation  could  be  established.  In  Decem-

dence by  referendum,  Yeltsin  and  the  leaders  of  Ukraine  and 
Belarus  met  to  form  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States 
(CIS — see  Glossary).  In  response  to  calls  by  the  Central  Asian 
and  other  union  republics  for  admission,  another  meeting  was 
held  in  Alma-Ata,  on  December  21,  to  form  an  expanded  CIS. 
At  that  meeting,  all  parties  declared  that  the  1922  treaty  of 
union  creating  the  Soviet  Union  was  annulled  and  that  the 
Soviet  Union  had  ceased  to  exist.  Gorbachev  announced  the 
decision  officially  December  25.  Russia  gained  international 
recognition  as  the  principal  successor  to  the  Soviet  Union, 
receiving  the  Soviet  Union's  permanent  seat  on  the  United 
Nations  Security  Council  and  positions  in  other  international 
and  regional  organizations.  The  CIS  states  also  agreed  that 
Russia  initially  would  take  over  Soviet  embassies  and  other 
properties  abroad. 

In  October  1991,  during  the  "honeymoon"  period  after  his 
resistance  to  the  Soviet  coup,  Yeltsin  convinced  the  legislature 
to  grant  him  important  special  executive  powers  for  one  year 
so  that  he  might  implement  his  economic  reforms.  In  Novem- 
ber 1991,  he  appointed  a  new  government,  with  himself  as  act- 
ing prime  minister,  a  post  he  held  until  the  appointment  of 
Yegor  Gaydar  as  acting  prime  minister  in  June  1992. 

During  1992  Yeltsin  and  his  reforms  came  under  increasing 
attack  by  former  communist  party  members  and  officials, 
extreme  nationalists,  and  others  calling  for  reform  to  be 
slowed  or  halted  in  Russia.  A  locus  of  this  opposition  was 
increasingly  the  bicameral  parliament,  whose  upper  house  was 
the  Congress  of  People's  Deputies  (CPD)  and  lower  house  the 
Supreme  Soviet.  The  lower  house  was  headed  by  Ruslan  Khas- 
bulatov,  who  became  Yeltsin's  most  vocal  opponent.  Under  the 
1978  constitution,  the  parliament  was  the  supreme  organ  of 
power  in  Russia.  After  Russia  added  the  office  of  president  in 
1991,  the  division  of  powers  between  the  two  branches  was 
ambiguous. 

Although  Yeltsin  managed  to  beat  back  most  challenges  to 
his  reform  program  when  the  CPD  met  in  April  1992,  in 
December  he  suffered  a  significant  loss  of  his  special  executive 
powers.  The  CPD  ordered  him  to  halt  appointments  of  admin- 
istrators in  the  localities  and  also  the  practice  of  naming  addi- 
tional local  oversight  emissaries  (termed  "presidential 
representatives").  Yeltsin  also  lost  the  power  to  issue  special 
decrees  concerning  the  economy,  while  retaining  his  constitu-

tional  power  to  issue  decrees  in  accordance  with  existing  laws. 
When  his  attempt  to  secure  confirmation  of  Gaydar  as  prime 
minister  was  rejected,  Yeltsin  appointed  Viktor  Chernomyrdin, 
whom  the  parliament  approved  because  he  was  viewed  as  more 
economically  conservative  than  Gaydar.  After  contentious 
negotiations  between  the  parliament  and  Yeltsin,  the  two  sides 
agreed  to  hold  a  national  referendum  to  allow  the  population 
to  determine  the  basic  division  of  powers  between  the  two 
branches  of  government.  In  the  meantime,  proposals  for 
extreme  limitation  of  Yeltsin's  power  were  tabled. 

However,  early  1993  saw  increasing  tension  between  Yeltsin 
and  the  parliament  over  the  language  of  the  referendum  and 
power  sharing.  In  mid-March  1993,  an  emergency  session  of 
the  CPD  rejected  Yeltsin's  proposals  on  power  sharing  and  can- 
celed the  referendum,  again  opening  the  door  to  legislation 
that  would  shift  the  balance  of  power  away  from  the  president. 
Faced  with  these  setbacks,  Yeltsin  addressed  the  nation  directly 
to  announce  a  "special  regime,"  under  which  he  would  assume 
extraordinary  executive  power  pending  the  results  of  a  referen- 
dum on  the  timing  of  new  legislative  elections,  on  a  new  consti- 
tution, and  on  public  confidence  in  the  president  and  vice 
president.  After  the  Constitutional  Court  declared  his 


389 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

announcement  unconstitutional,  Yeltsin  backed  down  (see  The 
Judiciary,  this  ch.). 

Despite  Yeltsin's  change  of  heart,  a  second  extraordinary  ses- 
sion of  the  CPD  took  up  discussion  of  emergency  measures  to 
defend  the  constitution,  including  impeachment  of  the  presi- 
dent. Although  the  impeachment  vote  failed,  the  CPD  set  new 
terms  for  a  popular  referendum.  The  legislature's  version  of 
the  referendum  asked  whether  citizens  had  confidence  in 
Yeltsin,  approved  of  his  reforms,  and  supported  early  presiden- 
tial and  legislative  elections.  Under  the  CPD's  terms,  Yeltsin 
would  need  the  support  of  50  percent  of  eligible  voters,  rather 
than  50  percent  of  those  actually  voting,  to  avoid  an  early  presi- 
dential election.  In  the  vote  on  April  25,  Russians  failed  to  pro- 
vide this  level  of  approval,  but  a  majority  of  voters  approved 
Yeltsin's  policies  and  called  for  new  legislative  elections.  Yeltsin 
termed  the  results,  which  were  a  serious  blow  to  the  prestige  of 
the  parliament,  a  mandate  for  him  to  continue  in  power. 

In  June  1993,  Yeltsin  decreed  the  creation  of  a  special  consti- 
tutional convention  to  examine  the  draft  constitution  that  he 
had  presented  in  April.  This  convention  was  designed  to  cir- 
cumvent the  parliament,  which  was  working  on  its  own  draft 
constitution.  As  expected,  the  two  main  drafts  contained  con- 
trary views  of  legislative-executive  relations.  The  convention, 
which  included  delegates  from  major  political  and  social  orga- 
nizations and  the  eighty-nine  subnational  jurisdictions, 
approved  a  compromise  draft  constitution  in  July  1993,  incor- 
porating some  aspects  of  the  parliament's  draft.  The  parlia- 
ment failed  to  approve  the  draft,  however. 

In  late  September  1993,  Yeltsin  responded  to  the  impasse  in 
legislative-executive  relations  by  repeating  his  announcement 
of  a  constitutional  referendum,  but  this  time  he  followed  the 
announcement  by  dissolving  the  parliament  and  announcing 
new  legislative  elections  for  December.  The  CPD  again  met  in 
emergency  session,  confirmed  Vice  President  Aleksandr 
Rutskoy  as  president,  and  voted  to  impeach  Yeltsin.  On  Sep- 
tember 27,  military  units  surrounded  the  legislative  building 
(popularly  known  as  the  White  House),  but  180  delegates 
refused  to  leave  the  building.  After  a  two-week  standoff, 
Rutskoy  urged  supporters  outside  the  legislative  building  to 
overcome  Yeltsin's  military  forces.  Firefights  and  destruction  of 
properly  resulted  at  several  locations  in  Moscow.  The  next  day, 
under  the  direction  of  Minister  of  Defense  Pavel  Grachev, 
tanks  fired  on  the  White  House,  and  military  forces  occupied

Government  and  Politics 


the  building  and  the  rest  of  the  city.  This  open,  violent  con- 
frontation remained  a  backdrop  to  Yeltsin's  relations  with  the 
legislative  branch  for  the  next  three  years. 

The  Constitution  and  Government  Structure 

During  1992-93  Yeltsin  had  argued  that  the  existing,  heavily 
amended  1978  constitution  of  Russia  was  obsolete  and  self-con- 
tradictory and  that  Russia  required  a  new  constitution  granting 
the  president  greater  power.  This  assertion  led  to  the  submis- 
sion and  advocacy  of  rival  constitutional  drafts  drawn  up  by  the 
legislative  and  executive  branches.  The  parliament's  failure  to 
endorse  a  compromise  was  an  important  factor  in  Yeltsin's  dis- 
solution of  the  body  in  September  1993.  Yeltsin  then  used  his 
presidential  powers  to  form  a  sympathetic  constitutional  assem- 
bly, which  quickly  produced  a  draft  constitution  providing  for  a 
strong  executive,  and  to  shape  the  outcome  of  the  December 
1993  referendum  on  Russia's  new  basic  law.  The  referendum 
vote  resulted  in  approval  by  58.4  percent  of  Russia's  registered 
voters.  The  announced  54.8  percent  turnout  met  the  require- 
ment that  at  least  50  percent  of  registered  voters  participate  in 
the  referendum. 

The  1993  constitution  declares  Russia  a  democratic,  federa- 
tive, law-based  state  with  a  republican  form  of  government. 
State  power  is  divided  among  the  legislative,  executive,  and 
judicial  branches.  Diversity  of  ideologies  and  religions  is  sanc- 
tioned, and  a  state  or  compulsory  ideology  may  not  be 
adopted.  The  right  to  a  multiparty  political  system  is  upheld. 
The  content  of  laws  must  be  made  public  before  they  take 
effect,  and  they  must  be  formulated  in  accordance  with  inter- 
national law  and  principles.  Russian  is  proclaimed  the  state  lan- 
guage, although  the  republics  of  the  federation  are  allowed  to 
establish  their  own  state  languages  for  use  alongside  Russian 
(see  The  Russian  Language,  ch.  4). 

The  Executive  Branch 

The  1993  constitution  created  a  dual  executive  consisting  of 
a  president  and  prime  minister,  but  the  president  is  the  domi- 
nant figure.  Russia's  strong  presidency  sometimes  is  compared 
with  that  of  Charles  de  Gaulle  (in  office  1958-69)  in  the 
French  Fifth  Republic.  The  constitution  spells  out  many  pre- 
rogatives specifically,  but  some  powers  enjoyed  by  Yeltsin  were 
developed  in  an  ad  hoc  manner.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Presidential  Powers 

Russia's  president  determines  the  basic  direction  of  Russia's 
domestic  and  foreign  policy  and  represents  the  Russian  state 
within  the  country  and  in  foreign  affairs.  The  president 
appoints  and  recalls  Russia's  ambassadors  upon  consultation 
with  the  legislature,  accepts  the  credentials  and  letters  of  recall 
of  foreign  representatives,  conducts  international  talks,  and 
signs  international  treaties.  A  special  provision  allowed  Yeltsin 
to  complete  the  term  prescribed  to  end  in  June  1996  and  to 
exercise  the  powers  of  the  new  constitution,  although  he  had 
been  elected  under  a  different  constitutional  order. 

In  the  1996  presidential  election  campaign,  some  candidates 
called  for  reducing  or  eliminating  the  presidency,  criticizing  its 
powers  as  dictatorial.  Yeltsin  defended  his  presidential  powers, 
claiming  that  Russians  desire  "a  vertical  power  structure  and  a 
strong  hand"  and  that  a  parliamentary  government  would 
result  in  indecisive  talk  rather  than  action. 

Several  prescribed  powers  put  the  president  in  a  superior 
position  vis-a-vis  the  legislature.  The  president  has  broad 
authority  to  issue  decrees  and  directives  that  have  the  force  of 
law  without  legislative  review,  although  the  constitution  notes 
that  they  must  not  contravene  that  document  or  other  laws. 
Under  certain  conditions,  the  president  may  dissolve  the  State 
Duma,  the  lower  house  of  parliament  (as  a  whole,  now  called 
the  Federal  Assembly) .  The  president  has  the  prerogatives  of 
scheduling  referendums  (a  power  previously  reserved  to  the 
parliament),  submitting  draft  laws  to  the  State  Duma,  and  pro- 
mulgating federal  laws. 

The  executive-legislative  crisis  of  the  fall  of  1993  prompted 
Yeltsin  to  emplace  constitutional  obstacles  to  legislative 
removal  of  the  president.  Under  the  1993  constitution,  if  the 
president  commits  "grave  crimes"  or  treason,  the  State  Duma 
may  file  impeachment  charges  with  the  parliament's  upper 
house,  the  Federation  Council.  These  charges  must  be  con- 
firmed by  a  ruling  of  the  Supreme  Court  that  the  president's 
actions  constitute  a  crime  and  by  a  ruling  of  the  Constitutional 
Court  that  proper  procedures  in  filing  charges  have  been  fol- 
lowed (see  The  Judiciary,  this  ch.).  The  charges  then  must  be 
adopted  by  a  special  commission  of  the  State  Duma  and  con- 
firmed by  at  least  two-thirds  of  State  Duma  deputies.  A  two- 
thirds  vote  of  the  Federation  Council  is  required  for  removal  of 
the  president.  If  the  Federation  Council  does  not  act  within 
three  months,  the  charges  are  dropped.  If  the  president  is

removed  from  office  or  becomes  unable  to  exercise  power 
because  of  serious  illness,  the  prime  minister  is  to  temporarily 
assume  the  president's  duties;  a  presidential  election  then  must 
be  held  within  three  months.  The  constitution  does  not  pro- 
vide for  a  vice  president,  and  there  is  no  specific  procedure  for 
determining  whether  the  president  is  able  to  carry  out  his 
duties. 

The  president  is  empowered  to  appoint  the  prime  minister 
to  chair  the  Government  (called  the  cabinet  or  the  council  of 
ministers  in  other  countries),  with  the  consent  of  the  State 
Duma.  The  president  chairs  meetings  of  the  Government, 
which  he  also  may  dismiss  in  its  entirety.  Upon  the  advice  of  the 
prime  minister,  the  president  can  appoint  or  remove  Govern- 
ment members,  including  the  deputy  prime  ministers.  The 
president  submits  candidates  to  the  State  Duma  for  the  post  of 
chairman  of  the  Russian  Central  Bank  (RCB)  and  may  propose 
that  the  State  Duma  dismiss  the  chairman  (see  Banking  and 
Finance,  ch.  6).  In  addition,  the  president  submits  candidates 
to  the  Federation  Council  for  appointment  as  justices  of  the 
Constitutional  Court,  the  Supreme  Court,  and  the  Superior 


393

Court  of  Arbitration,  as  well  as  candidates  for  the  office  of 
procurator  general,  Russia's  chief  law  enforcement  officer  (see 
The  Procuracy,  ch.  10).  The  president  also  appoints  justices  of 
federal  district  courts. 

Informal  Powers  and  Power  Centers 

Many  of  the  president's  powers  are  related  to  the  incum- 
bent's undisputed  leeway  in  forming  an  administration  and  hir- 
ing staff.  The  presidential  administration  is  composed  of 
several  competing,  overlapping,  and  vaguely  delineated  hierar- 
chies that  historically  have  resisted  efforts  at  consolidation.  In 
early  1996,  Russian  sources  reported  the  size  of  the  presidential 
apparatus  in  Moscow  and  the  localities  at  more  than  75,000 
people,  most  of  them  employees  of  state-owned  enterprises 
directly  under  presidential  control.  This  structure  is  similar  to, 
but  several  times  larger  than,  the  top-level  apparatus  of  the 
Soviet-era  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU — see 
Glossary) . 

Former  first  deputy  prime  minister  Anatoliy  Chubays  was 
appointed  chief  of  the  presidential  administration  (chief  of 
staff)  in  July  1996.  Chubays  replaced  Nikolay  Yegorov,  a  hard- 
line associate  of  deposed  Presidential  Security  Service  chief 
Aleksandr  Korzhakov.  Yegorov  had  been  appointed  in  early 
1996,  when  Yeltsin  reacted  to  the  strong  showing  of  antireform 
factions  in  the  legislative  election  by  purging  reformers  from 
his  administration.  Yeltsin  now  ordered  Chubays,  who  had 
been  included  in  that  purge,  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  adminis- 
tration and  the  number  of  departments  overseeing  the  func- 
tions of  the  ministerial  apparatus.  The  six  administrative 
departments  in  existence  at  that  time  dealt  with  citizens'  rights, 
domestic  and  foreign  policy,  state  and  legal  matters,  personnel, 
analysis,  and  oversight,  and  Chubays  inherited  a  staff  estimated 
at  2,000  employees.  Chubays  also  received  control  over  a  presi- 
dential advisory  group  with  input  on  the  economy,  national 
security,  and  other  matters.  Reportedly  that  group  had  com- 
peted with  Korzhakov's  security  service  for  influence  in  the 
Yeltsin  administration. 

Another  center  of  power  in  the  presidential  administration 
is  the  Security  Council,  which  was  created  by  statute  in  mid- 
1992  (see  The  Security  Council,  ch.  8).  The  1993  constitution 
describes  the  council  as  formed  and  headed  by  the  president 
and  governed  by  statute.  Since  its  formation,  it  apparently  has 
gradually  lost  influence  in  competition  with  other  power  cen-

ters  in  the  presidential  administration.  However,  the  June  1996 
appointment  of  former  army  general  and  presidential  candi- 
date Aleksandr  Lebed'  to  head  the  Security  Council  improved 
prospects  for  the  organization's  standing.  In  July  1996,  a  presi- 
dential decree  assigned  the  Security  Council  a  wide  variety  of 
new  missions.  The  decree's  description  of  the  Security  Coun- 
cil's consultative  functions  was  especially  vague  and  wide-rang- 
ing, although  it  positioned  the  head  of  the  Security  Council 
directly  subordinate  to  the  president.  As  had  been  the  case  pre- 
viously, the  Security  Council  was  required  to  hold  meetings  at 
least  once  a  month  (see  The  President,  ch.  8). 

Other  presidential  support  services  include  the  Control 
Directorate  (in  charge  of  investigating  official  corruption),  the 
Administrative  Affairs  Directorate,  the  Presidential  Press  Ser- 


395 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

vice,  and  the  Protocol  Directorate.  The  Administrative  Affairs 
Directorate  controls  state  dachas,  sanatoriums,  automobiles, 
office  buildings,  and  other  perquisites  of  high  office  for  the 
executive,  legislative,  and  judicial  branches  of  government,  a 
function  that  includes  management  of  more  than  200  state 
industries  with  about  50,000  employees.  The  Committee  on 
Operational  Questions,  until  June  1996  chaired  by  antireform- 
ist  Oleg  Soskovets,  has  been  described  as  a  "government  within 
a  government."  Also  attached  to  the  presidency  are  more  than 
two  dozen  consultative  commissions  and  extrabudgetary 
"funds." 

The  president  also  has  extensive  powers  over  military  policy. 
As  the  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces,  the  president 
approves  defense  doctrine,  appoints  and  removes  the  high 
command  of  the  armed  forces,  and  confers  higher  military 
ranks  and  awards  (see  Command  Structure,  ch.  9).  The  presi- 
dent is  empowered  to  declare  national  or  regional  states  of 
martial  law,  as  well  as  states  of  emergency.  In  both  cases,  both 
chambers  of  the  parliament  must  be  notified  immediately.  The 
Federation  Council,  the  upper  chamber,  has  the  power  to  con- 
firm or  reject  such  a  decree.  The  regime  of  martial  law  is 
defined  by  federal  law.  The  circumstances  and  procedures  for 
the  president  to  declare  a  state  of  emergency  are  more  specifi- 
cally outlined  in  federal  law  than  in  the  constitution.  In  prac- 
tice, the  Constitutional  Court  ruled  in  1995  that  the  president 
has  wide  leeway  in  responding  to  crises  within  Russia,  such  as 
lawlessness  in  the  separatist  Republic  of  Chechnya,  and  that 
Yeltsin's  action  in  Chechnya  did  not  require  a  formal  declara- 
tion of  a  state  of  emergency  (see  Movements  Toward  Sover- 
eignty, ch.  4;  Chechnya,  ch.  9;  Security  Operations  in 
Chechnya,  ch.  10).  In  1994  Yeltsin  declared  a  state  of  emer- 
gency in  Ingushetia  and  North  Ossetia,  two  republics  beset  by 
intermittent  ethnic  conflict. 

Presidential  Elections 

The  constitution  sets  few  requirements  for  presidential  elec- 
tions, deferring  in  many  matters  to  other  provisions  established 
by  law  The  presidential  term  is  set  at  four  years,  and  the  presi- 
dent may  serve  only  two  terms.  A  candidate  for  president  must 
be  a  citizen  of  Russia,  at  least  thirty-five  years  of  age,  and  a  resi- 
dent of  the  country  for  at  least  ten  years.  If  a  president 
becomes  unable  to  continue  in  office  because  of  health  prob- 
lems, resignation,  impeachment,  or  death,  a  presidential  elec- 


396 


Government  and  Politics 


tion  is  to  be  held  not  more  than  three  months  later.  In  such  a 
situation,  the  Federation  Council  is  empowered  to  set  the  elec- 
tion date. 

The  Law  on  Presidential  Elections,  ratified  in  May  1995, 
establishes  the  legal  basis  for  presidential  elections.  Based  on  a 
draft  submitted  by  Yeltsin's  office,  the  new  law  included  many 
provisions  already  contained  in  the  Russian  Republic's  1990 
election  law;  alterations  included  the  reduction  in  the  number 
of  signatures  required  to  register  a  candidate  from  2  million  to 
1  million.  The  law,  which  set  rigorous  standards  for  fair  cam- 
paign and  election  procedures,  was  hailed  by  international  ana- 
lysts as  a  major  step  toward  democratization.  Under  the  law, 
parties,  blocs,  and  voters'  groups  register  with  the  Central  Elec- 
toral Commission  (CEC)  and  designate  their  candidates.  These 
organizations  then  are  permitted  to  begin  seeking  the  1  mil- 
lion signatures  needed  to  register  their  candidates;  no  more 
than  7  percent  of  the  signatures  may  come  from  a  single  fed- 
eral jurisdiction.  The  purpose  of  the  7  percent  requirement  is 
to  promote  candidacies  with  broad  territorial  bases  and  elimi- 
nate those  supported  by  only  one  city  or  ethnic  enclave. 

The  law  requires  that  at  least  50  percent  of  eligible  voters 
participate  in  order  for  a  presidential  election  to  be  valid.  In 
State  Duma  debate  over  the  legislation,  some  deputies  had 
advocated  a  minimum  of  25  percent  (which  was  later  incorpo- 
rated into  the  electoral  law  covering  the  State  Duma) ,  warning 
that  many  Russians  were  disillusioned  with  voting  and  would 
not  turn  out.  To  make  voter  participation  easier,  the  law 
required  one  voting  precinct  for  approximately  every  3,000  vot- 
ers, with  voting  allowed  until  late  at  night.  The  conditions  for 
absentee  voting  were  eased,  and  portable  ballot  boxes  were  to 
be  made  available  on  demand.  Strict  requirements  were  estab- 
lished for  the  presence  of  election  observers,  including  emis- 
saries from  all  participating  parties,  blocs,  and  groups,  at 
polling  places  and  local  electoral  commissions  to  guard  against 
tampering  and  to  ensure  proper  tabulation. 

The  Law  on  Presidential  Elections  requires  that  the  winner 
receive  more  than  50  percent  of  the  votes  cast.  If  no  candidate 
receives  more  than  50  percent  of  the  vote  (a  highly  probable 
result  because  of  multiple  candidacies),  the  top  two  vote-get- 
ters must  face  each  other  in  a  runoff  election.  Once  the  results 
of  the  first  round  are  known,  the  runoff  election  must  be  held 
within  fifteen  days.  A  traditional  provision  allows  voters  to 
check  off  "none  of  the  above,"  meaning  that  a  candidate  in  a 


397

two-person  runoff  might  win  without  attaining  a  majority. 
Another  provision  of  the  election  law  empowers  the  CEC  to 
request  that  the  Supreme  Court  ban  a  candidate  from  the  elec- 
tion if  that  candidate  advocates  a  violent  transformation  of  the 
constitutional  order  or  the  integrity  of  the  Russian  Federation. 

The  presidential  election  of  1996  was  a  major  episode  in  the 
struggle  between  Yeltsin  and  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  (Kommunisticheskaya  partiya  Rossiyskoy  Fed- 
eratsii — KPRF),  which  sought  to  oust  Yeltsin  from  office  and 
return  to  power.  Yeltsin  had  banned  the  Communist  Party  of 
the  Russian  Republic  for  its  central  role  in  the  August  1991 
coup  against  the  Gorbachev  government.  As  a  member  of  the 
Politburo  and  the  Secretariat  of  the  banned  party,  Gennadiy 
Zyuganov  had  worked  hard  to  gain  its  relegalization.  Despite 
Yeltsin's  objections,  the  Constitutional  Court  cleared  the  way 
for  the  Russian  communists  to  reemerge  as  the  KPRF,  headed 
by  Zyuganov,  in  February  1993.  Yeltsin  temporarily  banned  the 
party  again  in  October  1993  for  its  role  in  the  Supreme  Soviet's 
just-concluded  attempt  to  overthrow  his  administration.  Begin- 
ning in  1993,  Zyuganov  also  led  efforts  by  KPRF  deputies  to 
impeach  Yeltsin.  After  the  KPRF's  triumph  in  the  December 
1995  legislative  elections,  Yeltsin  announced  that  he  would  run 
for  reelection  with  the  main  purpose  of  safeguarding  Russia 
from  a  communist  restoration. 

Although  there  was  speculation  that  losing  parties  in  the 
December  1995  election  might  choose  not  to  nominate  presi- 
dential candidates,  in  fact  dozens  of  citizens  both  prominent 
and  obscure  announced  their  candidacies.  After  the  gathering 
and  review  of  signature  lists,  the  CEC  validated  eleven  candi- 
dates, one  of  whom  later  dropped  out. 

In  the  opinion  polls  of  early  1996,  Yeltsin  trailed  far  behind 
most  of  the  other  candidates;  his  popularity  rating  was  below 
10  percent  for  a  prolonged  period.  However,  a  last-minute, 
intense  campaign  featuring  heavy  television  exposure, 
speeches  throughout  Russia  promising  increased  state  expen- 
ditures for  a  wide  variety  of  interest  groups,  and  campaign- 
sponsored  concerts  boosted  Yeltsin  to  a  3  percent  plurality  over 
Zyuganov  in  the  first  round.  At  that  point,  Yeltsin  took  the  tacti- 
cally significant  step  of  appointing  first-round  presidential  can- 
didate Aleksandr  Lebed',  who  had  placed  third  behind  Yeltsin 
and  Zyuganov,  as  head  of  the  Security  Council.  Yeltsin  followed 
the  appointment  of  Lebed'  as  the  president's  top  adviser  on 
national  security  by  dismissing  several  top  hard-line  members 


398 


Government  and  Politics 


of  his  entourage  who  were  widely  blamed  for  human  rights  vio- 
lations in  Chechnya  and  other  mistakes.  Despite  his  virtual  dis- 
appearance from  public  view  for  health  reasons  shortly 
thereafter,  Yeltsin  was  able  to  sustain  his  central  message  that 
Russia  should  move  forward  rather  than  return  to  its  commu- 
nist past.  Zyuganov  failed  to  mount  an  energetic  or  convincing 
second  campaign,  and  three  weeks  after  the  first  phase  of  the 
election,  Yeltsin  easily  defeated  his  opponent,  54  percent  to  40 
percent  (see  table  24,  Appendix). 

Turnout  in  the  first  round  was  high,  with  about  70  percent 
of  108.5  million  voters  participating.  Total  turnout  in  the  sec- 
ond round  was  nearly  the  same  as  in  the  first  round.  A  contin- 
gent of  almost  1,000  international  observers  judged  the 
election  to  be  largely  fair  and  democratic,  as  did  the  CEG. 

Most  observers  in  Russia  and  elsewhere  concurred  that  the 
election  boosted  democratization  in  Russia,  and  many  asserted 
that  reforms  in  Russia  had  become  irreversible.  Yeltsin  had 
strengthened  the  institution  of  regularly  contested  elections 
when  he  rejected  calls  by  business  organizations  and  other 
groups  and  some  of  his  own  officials  to  cancel  or  postpone  the 
balloting  because  of  the  threat  of  violence.  The  high  turnout 
indicated  that  voters  had  confidence  that  their  ballots  would 
count,  and  the  election  went  forward  without  incident.  The 
democratization  process  also  was  bolstered  by  Yeltsin's  willing- 
ness to  change  key  personnel  and  policies  in  response  to  public 
protests  and  by  his  unprecedented  series  of  personal  campaign 
appearances  throughout  Russia. 

The  Government  ( Cabinet) 

The  constitution  prescribes  that  the  Government  of  Russia, 
which  corresponds  to  the  Western  cabinet  structure,  consist  of 
a  prime  minister  (chairman  of  the  Government),  deputy  prime 
ministers,  and  federal  ministers  and  their  ministries  and 
departments.  Within  one  week  of  appointment  by  the  presi- 
dent and  approval  by  the  State  Duma,  the  prime  minister  must 
submit  to  the  president  nominations  for  all  subordinate  Gov- 
ernment positions,  including  deputy  prime  ministers  and  fed- 
eral ministers.  The  prime  minister  carries  out  administration 
in  line  with  the  constitution  and  laws  and  presidential  decrees. 
The  ministries  of  the  Government,  which  numbered  twenty- 
four  in  mid-1996,  execute  credit  and  monetary  policies  and 
defense,  foreign  policy,  and  state  security  functions;  ensure  the 
rule  of  law  and  respect  for  human  and  civil  rights;  protect 


399 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

property;  and  take  measures  against  crime.  If  the  Government 
issues  implementing  decrees  and  directives  that  are  at  odds 
with  legislation  or  presidential  decrees,  the  president  may 
rescind  them. 

The  Government  formulates  the  state  budget,  submits  it  to 
the  State  Duma,  and  issues  a  report  on  its  implementation.  In 
late  1994,  the  parliament  successfully  demanded  that  the  Gov- 
ernment begin  submitting  quarterly  reports  on  budget  expen- 
ditures and  adhere  to  other  guidelines  on  budgetary  matters, 
although  the  parliament's  budgetary  powers  are  limited.  If  the 
State  Duma  rejects  a  draft  budget  from  the  Government,  the 
budget  is  submitted  to  a  conciliation  commission  including 
members  from  both  branches. 

Besides  the  ministries,  in  1996  the  executive  branch 
included  eleven  state  committees  and  forty-six  state  services 
and  agencies,  ranging  from  the  State  Space  Agency  (Glavkos- 
mos)  to  the  State  Committee  for  Statistics  (Goskomstat).  There 
were  also  myriad  agencies,  boards,  centers,  councils,  commis- 
sions, and  committees.  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Chernomyrdin's 
personal  staff  was  reported  to  number  about  2,000  in  1995. 

Chernomyrdin,  who  had  been  appointed  prime  minister  in 
late  1992  to  appease  antireform  factions,  established  a  gener- 
ally smooth  working  relationship  with  Yeltsin.  Chernomyrdin 
proved  adept  at  conciliating  hostile  domestic  factions  and  at 
presenting  a  positive  image  of  Russia  in  negotiations  with  other 
nations.  However,  as  Yeltsin's  standing  with  public  opinion 
plummeted  in  1995,  Chernomyrdin  became  one  of  many  Gov- 
ernment officials  who  received  public  blame  from  the  presi- 
dent for  failures  in  the  Yeltsin  administration.  As  part  of  his 
presidential  campaign,  Yeltsin  threatened  to  replace  the  Cher- 
nomyrdin Government  if  it  failed  to  address  pressing  social 
welfare  problems  in  Russia.  After  the  mid-1996  presidential 
election,  however,  Yeltsin  announced  that  he  would  nominate 
Chernomyrdin  to  head  the  new  Government. 

The  Parliament 

The  628-member  parliament,  termed  the  Federal  Assembly, 
consists  of  two  chambers,  the  450-member  State  Duma  (the 
lower  house)  and  the  178-member  Federation  Council  (the 
upper  house).  Russia's  legislative  body  was  established  by  the 
constitution  approved  in  the  December  1993  referendum.  The 
first  elections  to  the  Federal  Assembly  were  held  at  the  same 
time — a  procedure  criticized  by  some  Russians  as  indicative  of 


400 


Government  and  Politics 


Yeltsin's  lack  of  respect  for  constitutional  niceties.  Under  the 
constitution,  the  deputies  elected  in  December  1993  were 
termed  "transitional"  because  they  were  to  serve  only  a  two-year 
term.  In  April  1994,  legislators,  Government  officials,  and 
many  prominent  businesspeople  and  religious  leaders  signed  a 
"Civic  Accord"  proposed  by  Yeltsin,  pledging  during  the  two- 
year  "transition  period"  to  refrain  from  violence,  calls  for  early 
presidential  or  legislative  elections,  and  attempts  to  amend  the 
constitution.  This  accord,  and  memories  of  the  violent  con- 
frontation of  the  previous  parliament  with  Government  forces, 
had  some  effect  in  softening  political  rhetoric  during  the  next 
two  years. 

The  first  legislative  elections  under  the  new  constitution 
included  a  few  irregularities.  The  republics  of  Tatarstan  and 
Chechnya  and  Chelyabinsk  Oblast  boycotted  the  voting;  this 
action,  along  with  other  discrepancies,  resulted  in  the  election 
of  only  170  members  to  the  Federation  Council.  However,  by 
mid-1994  all  seats  were  filled  except  those  of  Chechnya,  which 
continued  to  proclaim  its  independence.  All  federal  jurisdic- 
tions participated  in  the  December  1995  legislative  races, 
although  the  fairness  of  voting  in  Chechnya  was  compromised 
by  the  ongoing  conflict  there. 

The  Federal  Assembly  is  prescribed  as  a  permanently  func- 
tioning body,  meaning  that  it  is  in  continuous  session  except 
for  a  regular  break  between  the  spring  and  fall  sessions.  This 
working  schedule  distinguishes  the  new  parliament  from 
Soviet-era  "rubber-stamp"  legislative  bodies,  which  met  only  a 
few  days  each  year.  The  new  constitution  also  directs  that  the 
two  chambers  meet  separately  in  sessions  open  to  the  public, 
although  joint  meetings  are  held  for  important  speeches  by  the 
president  or  foreign  leaders. 

Deputies  of  the  State  Duma  work  full-time  on  their  legisla- 
tive duties;  they  are  not  allowed  to  serve  simultaneously  in  local 
legislatures  or  hold  Government  positions.  A  transitional 
clause  in  the  constitution,  however,  allowed  deputies  elected  in 
December  1993  to  retain  their  Government  employment,  a 
provision  that  allowed  many  officials  of  the  Yeltsin  administra- 
tion to  serve  in  the  parliament.  After  the  December  1995  legis- 
lative elections,  nineteen  Government  officials  were  forced  to 
resign  their  offices  in  order  to  take  up  their  legislative  duties. 

Despite  its  "transitional"  nature,  the  Federal  Assembly  of 
1994-95  approved  about  500  pieces  of  legislation  in  two  years. 
When  the  new  parliament  convened  in  January  1996,  deputies 


401 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

were  provided  with  a  catalog  of  these  laws  and  were  directed  to 
work  in  their  assigned  committees  to  fill  gaps  in  existing  legisla- 
tion as  well  as  to  draft  new  laws.  A  major  accomplishment  of 
the  1994-95  legislative  sessions  was  passage  of  the  first  two 
parts  of  a  new  civil  code,  desperately  needed  to  update  anti- 
quated Soviet-era  provisions.  The  new  code  included  provi- 
sions on  contract  obligations,  rents,  insurance,  loans  and 
credit,  partnership,  and  trusteeship,  as  well  as  other  legal  stan- 
dards essential  to  support  the  creation  of  a  market  economy. 
Work  on  several  bills  that  had  been  in  committee  or  in  floor 
debate  in  the  previous  legislature  resumed  in  the  new  body. 
Similarly,  several  bills  that  Yeltsin  had  vetoed  were  taken  up 
again  by  the  new  legislature. 

Structure  of  fine  Federal  Assembly 

The  composition  of  the  Federation  Council  was  a  matter  of 
debate  until  shortly  before  the  1995  elections.  The  legislation 
that  emerged  in  December  1995  over  Federation  Council 
objections  clarified  the  constitution's  language  on  the  subject 
by  providing  ex  officio  council  seats  to  the  heads  of  local  legis- 
latures and  administrations  in  each  of  the  eighty-nine  subna- 
tional  jurisdictions,  hence  a  total  of  178  seats.  As  composed  in 
1996,  the  Federation  Council  included  about  fifty  chief  execu- 
tives of  subnational  jurisdictions  who  had  been  appointed  to 
their  posts  by  Yeltsin  during  1991-92,  then  won  popular  elec- 
tion directly  to  the  body  in  December  1993.  But  the  law  of  1995 
provided  for  popular  elections  of  chief  executives  in  all  subna- 
tional jurisdictions,  including  those  still  governed  by  presiden- 
tial appointees.  The  individuals  chosen  in  those  elections  then 
would  assume  ex  officio  seats  in  the  Federation  Council. 

Each  legislative  chamber  elects  a  chairman  to  control  the 
internal  procedures  of  the  chamber.  The  chambers  also  form 
committees  and  commissions  to  deal  with  particular  types  of 
issues.  Unlike  committees  and  commissions  in  previous  Rus- 
sian and  Soviet  parliaments,  those  operating  under  the  1993 
constitution  have  significant  responsibilities  in  devising  legisla- 
tion and  conducting  oversight.  They  prepare  and  evaluate 
draft  laws,  report  on  draft  laws  to  their  chambers,  conduct 
hearings,  and  oversee  implementation  of  the  laws.  As  of  early 
1996,  there  were  twenty-eight  committees  and  several  ad  hoc 
commissions  in  the  State  Duma,  and  twelve  committees  and 
two  commissions  in  the  Federation  Council.  The  Federation 
Council  has  established  fewer  committees  because  of  the  part- 


402 


Government  and  Politics 


time  status  of  its  members,  who  also  hold  political  office  in  the 
subnational  jurisdictions.  In  1996  most  of  the  committees  in 
both  houses  were  retained  in  basic  form  from  the  previous  par- 
liament. According  to  internal  procedure,  no  deputy  may  sit 
on  more  than  one  committee.  By  1996  many  State  Duma  com- 
mittees had  established  subcommittees. 

Committee  positions  are  allocated  when  new  parliaments 
are  seated.  The  general  policy  calls  for  allocation  of  committee 
chairmanships  and  memberships  among  parties  and  factions 
roughly  in  proportion  to  the  size  of  their  representation.  In 
1994,  however,  Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's  Liberal-Democratic 
Party  of  Russia  (Liberal'no-demokraticheskaya  partiya  Rossii — 
LDPR),  which  had  won  the  second  largest  number  of  seats  in 
the  recent  election,  was  denied  all  but  one  key  chairmanship, 
that  of  the  State  Duma's  Committee  on  Geopolitics. 

Legislative  Powers 

The  two  chambers  of  the  Federal  Assembly  possess  different 
powers  and  responsibilities,  with  the  State  Duma  the  more 
powerful.  The  Federation  Council,  as  its  name  and  composi- 
tion implies,  deals  primarily  with  issues  of  concern  to  the  sub- 
national  jurisdictions,  such  as  adjustments  to  internal  borders 
and  decrees  of  the  president  establishing  martial  law  or  states 
of  emergency.  As  the  upper  chamber,  it  also  has  responsibilities 
in  confirming  and  removing  the  procurator  general  and  con- 
firming justices  of  the  Constitutional  Court,  the  Supreme 
Court,  and  the  Superior  Court  of  Arbitration,  upon  the  recom- 
mendation of  the  president.  The  Federation  Council  also  is 
entrusted  with  the  final  decision  if  the  State  Duma  recom- 
mends removing  the  president  from  office.  The  constitution 
also  directs  that  the  Federation  Council  examine  bills  passed  by 
the  lower  chamber  dealing  with  budgetary,  tax,  and  other  fiscal 
measures,  as  well  as  issues  dealing  with  war  and  peace  and  with 
treaty  ratification. 

In  the  consideration  and  disposition  of  most  legislative  mat- 
ters, however,  the  Federation  Council  has  less  power  than  the 
State  Duma.  All  bills,  even  those  proposed  by  the  Federation 
Council,  must  first  be  considered  by  the  State  Duma.  If  the  Fed- 
eration Council  rejects  a  bill  passed  by  the  State  Duma,  the  two 
chambers  may  form  a  conciliation  commission  to  work  out  a 
compromise  version  of  the  legislation.  The  State  Duma  then 
votes  on  the  compromise  bill.  If  the  State  Duma  objects  to  the 
proposals  of  the  upper  chamber  in  the  conciliation  process,  it 


403 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

may  vote  by  a  two-thirds  majority  to  send  its  version  to  the  pres- 
ident for  signature.  The  part-time  character  of  the  Federation 
Council's  work,  its  less  developed  committee  structure,  and  its 
lesser  powers  vis-a-vis  the  State  Duma  make  it  more  a  consulta- 
tive and  reviewing  body  than  a  law-making  chamber. 

Because  the  Federation  Council  initially  included  many 
regional  administrators  appointed  by  Yeltsin,  that  body  often 
supported  the  president  and  objected  to  bills  approved  by  the 
State  Duma,  which  had  more  anti-Yeltsin  deputies.  The  power 
of  the  upper  chamber  to  consider  bills  passed  by  the  lower 
chamber  resulted  in  its  disapproval  of  about  one-half  of  such 
bills,  necessitating  concessions  by  the  State  Duma  or  votes  to 
override  upper-chamber  objections.  In  February  1996,  the 
heads  of  the  two  chambers  pledged  to  try  to  break  this  habit, 
but  wrangling  appeared  to  intensify  in  the  months  that  fol- 
lowed. 

The  State  Duma  confirms  the  appointment  of  the  prime 
minister,  although  it  does  not  have  the  power  to  confirm  Gov- 
ernment ministers.  The  power  to  confirm  or  reject  the  prime 
minister  is  severely  limited.  According  to  the  1993  constitution, 
the  State  Duma  must  decide  within  one  week  to  confirm  or 
reject  a  candidate  once  the  president  has  placed  that  person's 
name  in  nomination.  If  it  rejects  three  candidates,  the  presi- 
dent is  empowered  to  appoint  a  prime  minister,  dissolve  the 
parliament,  and  schedule  new  legislative  elections. 

The  State  Duma's  power  to  force  the  resignation  of  the  Gov- 
ernment also  is  severely  limited.  It  may  express  a  vote  of  no- 
confidence  in  the  Government  by  a  majority  vote  of  all  mem- 
bers of  the  State  Duma,  but  the  president  is  allowed  to  disre- 
gard this  vote.  If,  however,  the  State  Duma  repeats  the  no- 
confidence  vote  within  three  months,  the  president  may  dis- 
miss the  Government.  But  the  likelihood  of  a  second  no-confi- 
dence vote  is  virtually  precluded  by  the  constitutional  provision 
allowing  the  president  to  dissolve  the  State  Duma  rather  than 
the  Government  in  such  a  situation.  The  Government's  posi- 
tion is  further  buttressed  by  another  constitutional  provision 
that  allows  the  Government  at  any  time  to  demand  a  vote  of 
confidence  from  the  State  Duma;  refusal  is  grounds  for  the 
president  to  dissolve  the  Duma. 

The  Legislative  Process 

Draft  laws  may  originate  in  either  legislative  chamber,  or 
they  may  be  submitted  by  the  president,  the  Government,  local 


404 


Government  and  Politics 


legislatures,  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Constitutional  Court,  or 
the  Superior  Court  of  Arbitration.  Draft  laws  are  first  consid- 
ered in  the  State  Duma.  Upon  adoption  by  a  majority  of  the 
full  State  Duma  membership,  a  draft  law  is  considered  by  the 
Federation  Council,  which  has  fourteen  days  to  place  the  bill 
on  its  calendar.  Conciliation  commissions  are  the  prescribed 
procedure  to  work  out  differences  in  bills  considered  by  both 
chambers. 

A  constitutional  provision  dictating  that  draft  laws  dealing 
with  revenues  and  expenditures  may  be  considered  "only  when 
the  Government's  findings  are  known"  substantially  limits  the 
Federal  Assembly's  control  of  state  finances.  However,  the  legis- 
lature may  alter  finance  legislation  submitted  by  the  Govern- 
ment at  a  later  time,  a  power  that  provides  a  degree  of 
traditional  legislative  control  over  the  purse.  The  two  chambers 
of  the  legislature  also  have  the  power  to  override  a  presidential 
veto  of  legislation.  The  constitution  provides  a  high  hurdle  for 
an  override,  however,  requiring  at  least  a  two-thirds  vote  of  the 
total  number  of  members  of  both  chambers. 

Clashes  of  Power,  1993-96 

Although  the  1993  constitution  weakened  their  standing  vis- 
a-vis the  presidency,  the  parliaments  elected  in  1993  and  1995 
nonetheless  used  their  powers  to  shape  legislation  according  to 
their  own  precepts  and  to  defy  Yeltsin  on  some  issues.  An  early 
example  was  the  February  1994  State  Duma  vote  to  grant 
amnesty  to  the  leaders  of  the  1991  Moscow  coup.  Yeltsin  vehe- 
mently denounced  this  action,  although  it  was  within  the  con- 
stitutional purview  of  the  State  Duma.  In  October  1994,  both 
legislative  chambers  passed  a  law  over  Yeltsin's  veto  requiring 
the  Government  to  submit  quarterly  reports  on  budget  expen- 
ditures to  the  State  Duma  and  adhere  to  other  budgetary 
guidelines. 

In  the  most  significant  executive-legislative  clash  since  1993, 
the  State  Duma  overwhelmingly  voted  no  confidence  in  the 
Government  in  June  1995.  The  vote  was  triggered  by  a 
Chechen  rebel  raid  into  the  neighboring  Russian  town  of 
Budennovsk,  where  the  rebels  were  able  to  take  more  than 
1,000  hostages.  Dissatisfaction  with  Yeltsin's  economic  reforms 
also  was  a  factor  in  the  vote.  A  second  motion  of  no  confidence 
failed  to  carry  in  early  July.  In  March  1996,  the  State  Duma 
again  incensed  Yeltsin  by  voting  to  revoke  the  December  1991 
resolution  of  the  Russian  Supreme  Soviet  abrogating  the  1922 


405 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

treaty  under  which  the  Soviet  Union  had  been  founded.  That 
resolution  had  prepared  the  way  for  formation  of  the  Com- 
monwealth of  Independent  States. 

In  his  February  1996  state  of  the  federation  speech,  Yeltsin 
commended  the  previous  parliament  for  passing  a  number  of 
significant  laws,  and  he  noted  with  relief  the  "civil"  resolution 
of  the  June  1995  no-confidence  conflict.  He  complained,  how- 
ever, that  the  Federal  Assembly  had  not  acted  on  issues  such  as 
the  private  ownership  of  land,  a  tax  code,  and  judicial  reform. 
Yeltsin  also  was  critical  of  legislation  that  he  had  been  forced  to 
return  to  the  parliament  because  it  contravened  the  constitu- 
tion and  existing  law,  and  of  legislative  attempts  to  pass  fiscal 
legislation  in  violation  of  the  constitutional  stricture  that  such 
bills  must  be  preapproved  by  the  Government.  He  noted  that 
he  would  continue  to  use  his  veto  power  against  ill-drafted  bills 
and  his  power  to  issue  decrees  on  issues  he  deemed  important, 
and  that  such  decrees  would  remain  in  force  until  suitable  laws 
were  passed.  The  State  Duma  passed  a  resolution  in  March 
1996  demanding  that  Yeltsin  refrain  from  returning  bills  to  the 
parliament  for  redrafting,  arguing  that  the  president  was  obli- 
gated either  to  sign  bills  or  to  veto  them. 

The  Judiciary 

The  Ministry  of  Justice  administers  Russia's  judicial  system. 
The  ministry's  responsibilities  include  the  establishment  of 
courts  and  the  appointment  of  judges  at  levels  below  the  fed- 
eral district  courts.  The  ministry  also  gathers  forensic  statistics 
and  conducts  sociological  research  and  educational  programs 
applicable  to  crime  prevention. 

Many  Western  observers  consider  the  judicial  and  legal  sys- 
tems weak  links  in  Russia's  reform  efforts,  stymieing  privatiza- 
tion, the  fight  against  crime  and  corruption,  the  protection  of 
civil  and  human  rights,  and  the  general  ascendancy  of  the  rule 
of  law.  Many  judges  appointed  by  the  regimes  of  Leonid  I. 
Brezhnev  (in  office  1964-82)  and  Yuriy  V.  Andropov  (in  office 
1982-84)  remained  in  place  in  the  mid-1990s.  Such  arbiters 
were  trained  in  "socialist  law"  and  had  become  accustomed  to 
basing  their  verdicts  on  telephone  calls  from  local  CPSU  bosses 
rather  than  on  the  legal  merits  of  cases. 

For  court  infrastructure  and  financial  support,  judges  must 
depend  on  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  for  housing  they  must 
depend  on  local  authorities  in  the  jurisdiction  where  they  sit. 
In  1995  the  average  salary  for  a  judge  was  US$160  per  month, 


406 


Government  and  Politics 


substantially  less  than  the  earnings  associated  with  more 
menial  positions  in  Russian  society.  These  circumstances,  com- 
bined with  irregularities  in  the  appointment  process  and  the 
continued  strong  position  of  the  procurators,  deprived  judges 
in  the  lower  jurisdictions  of  independent  authority  (see  The 
Procuracy,  ch.  10). 

Judicial  Reform 

In  1992  a  new  Law  on  the  Status  of  Judges  was  passed.  The 
law  was  intended  to  confer  greater  status  on  the  judicial  profes- 
sion by  raising  salaries  and  benefits.  The  1993  constitution  pro- 
vides for  some  degree  of  judicial  reform  by  establishing  an 
independent  judiciary  and  specifying  that  justices  may  only  be 
removed  or  their  powers  curtailed  or  terminated  in  accordance 
with  the  law.  Sitting  justices  also  enjoy  immunity  from  prosecu- 
tion. However,  judicial  reform  has  moved  slowly  despite  those 
two  legislative  developments,  and  in  1996  the  judiciary 
remained  subject  to  the  influence  of  security  agencies  and  poli- 
ticians. A  large  case  backlog,  trial  delays,  and  lengthy  pretrial 
detention  also  remain  problems  (see  How  the  System  Works, 
ch.  10). 

According  to  a  provision  approved  in  1994,  trial  by  jury  may 
take  place  in  specific  types  of  cases,  including  those  involving 
the  death  penalty.  This  reform  supersedes  in  part  the  older  sys- 
tem of  trial  by  judges  and  lay  "people's  assessors"  who  usually 
acceded  to  the  judges'  verdicts.  In  practice,  trial  by  jury  has 
made  little  headway  in  the  hidebound  court  system.  In  1995 
jury  trials  were  only  available  in  nine  of  the  eighty-nine  subna- 
tional  jurisdictions,  although  other  jurisdictions  sought  permis- 
sion to  introduce  them. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  a  total  of  about  14,000  judges  were  active 
in  approximately  2,500  courts  at  all  judicial  levels.  To  be  eligi- 
ble for  appointment  as  a  judge,  an  individual  must  be  at  least 
twenty-five  years  of  age,  have  a  higher  education  in  law,  and 
have  at  least  five  years  of  experience  in  the  legal  profession. 

Structure  of  the  Judiciary 

The  twenty-three-member  Supreme  Court  is  Russia's  highest 
court  of  origination  and  of  appeals  for  consideration  of  crimi- 
nal, civil,  and  administrative  cases.  Its  chairman  in  1996, 
Vyacheslav  Lebedev,  had  been  a  judge  in  Leningrad  and  Mos- 
cow for  nineteen  years  before  his  appointment  in  1989.  The 
Superior  Court  of  Arbitration,  which  is  headed  by  a  board  of 


407 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

one  chairman  and  four  deputy  chairmen,  is  the  highest  court 
for  the  resolution  of  economic  disputes.  Courts  of  arbitration 
also  exist  at  lower  jurisdictional  levels.  The  nineteen-member 
Constitutional  Court  decides  whether  federal  laws,  presidential 
and  federal  decrees  and  directives,  and  local  constitutions, 
charters,  and  laws  comply  with  the  federal  constitution.  Trea- 
ties between  the  national  government  and  a  regional  jurisdic- 
tion and  between  regional  jurisdictions  are  subject  to  the  same 
oversight.  The  Constitutional  Court  also  resolves  jurisdictional 
disputes  between  federal  or  local  organs  of  power,  and  it  also 
may  be  asked  to  interpret  the  federal  constitution.  The  Consti- 
tutional Court  temporarily  ceased  to  exist  after  Yeltsin  dis- 
solved the  parliament  in  October  1993.  Although  prescribed  in 
the  new  constitution,  the  court  remained  moribund  in  1994 
because  no  new  law  was  passed  governing  its  procedures  and 
composition.  In  1995  the  Federation  Council  finally  approved 
appointments  to  the  Constitutional  Court,  and  it  resumed 
operation  that  year. 

Under  the  constitution,  judges  of  the  three  highest  courts 
serve  for  life  and  are  appointed  by  the  Federation  Council 
after  nomination  by  the  president.  The  president  appoints 
judges  at  the  next  level,  the  federal  district  courts.  The  minister 
of  justice  is  responsible  for  appointing  judges  to  regional  and 
city  courts.  However,  in  practice  many  appointments  below  the 
national  level  still  are  made  by  the  chief  executives  of  subna- 
tional  jurisdictions,  a  practice  that  has  perpetuated  local  politi- 
cal influence  on  judges'  decisions  (see  Local  and  Regional 
Government,  this  ch.). 

Local  and  Regional  Government 

In  the  Soviet  period,  some  of  Russia's  approximately  100 
nationalities  were  granted  their  own  ethnic  enclaves,  to  which 
varying  formal  federal  rights  were  attached  (see  Minority  Peo- 
ples and  Their  Territories,  ch.  4).  Other  smaller  or  more  dis- 
persed nationalities  did  not  receive  such  recognition.  In  most 
of  these  enclaves,  ethnic  Russians  constituted  a  majority  of  the 
population,  although  the  titular  nationalities  usually  enjoyed 
disproportionate  representation  in  local  government  bodies. 
Relations  between  the  central  government  and  the  subordinate 
jurisdictions,  and  among  those  jurisdictions,  became  a  political 
issue  in  the  1990s. 

The  Russian  Federation  has  made  few  changes  in  the  Soviet 
pattern  of  regional  jurisdictions.  The  1993  constitution  estab- 


408 


Government  and  Politics 


lishes  a  federal  government  and  enumerates  eighty-nine  subna- 
tional  jurisdictions,  including  twenty-one  ethnic  enclaves  with 
the  status  of  republics.  There  are  ten  autonomous  regions,  or 
okruga  (sing.,  okrug),  and  the  Jewish  Autonomous  Oblast 
(Yevreyskaya  avtonomnaya  oblast1,  also  known  as  Birobidzhan). 
Besides  the  ethnically  identified  jurisdictions,  there  are  six  ter- 
ritories (kraya;  sing.,  kray)  and  forty-nine  oblasts  (provinces). 
The  cities  of  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  are  independent  of 
surrounding  jurisdictions;  termed  "cities  of  federal  signifi- 
cance," they  have  the  same  status  as  the  oblasts.  The  ten  auton- 
omous regions  and  Birobidzhan  are  part  of  larger  jurisdictions, 
either  an  oblast  or  a  territory  (see  fig.  1).  As  the  power  and 
influence  of  the  central  government  have  become  diluted,  gov- 
ernors and  mayors  have  become  the  only  relevant  government 
authorities  in  many  jurisdictions. 

The  Federation  Treaty  and  Regional  Power 

The  Federation  Treaty  was  signed  in  March  1992  by  Presi- 
dent Yeltsin  and  most  leaders  of  the  autonomous  republics  and 
other  ethnic  and  geographical  subunits.  The  treaty  consisted  of 
three  separate  documents,  each  pertaining  to  one  type  of 
regional  jurisdiction.  It  outlined  powers  reserved  for  the  cen- 
tral government,  shared  powers,  and  residual  powers  to  be 
exercised  primarily  by  the  subunits.  Because  Russia's  new  con- 
stitution remained  in  dispute  in  the  Federal  Assembly  at  the 
time  of  ratification,  the  Federation  Treaty  and  provisions  based 
on  the  treaty  were  incorporated  as  amendments  to  the  1978 
constitution.  A  series  of  new  conditions  were  established  by  the 
1993  constitution  and  by  bilateral  agreements. 

Local  Jurisdictions  under  the  Constitution 

The  constitution  of  1993  resolved  many  of  the  ambiguities 
and  contradictions  concerning  the  degree  of  decentralization 
under  the  much-amended  1978  constitution  of  the  Russian 
Republic;  most  such  solutions  favored  the  concentration  of 
power  in  the  central  government.  When  the  constitution  was 
ratified,  the  Federation  Treaty  was  demoted  to  the  status  of  a 
subconstitutional  document.  A  transitional  provision  of  the 
constitution  provided  that  in  case  of  discrepancies  between  the 
federal  constitution  and  the  Federation  Treaty,  or  between  the 
constitution  and  other  treaties  involving  a  subnational  jurisdic- 
tion, all  other  documents  would  defer  to  the  constitution. 


409 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  1993  constitution  presents  a  daunting  list  of  powers 
reserved  to  the  center.  Powers  shared  jointly  between  the  fed- 
eral and  local  authorities  are  less  numerous.  Regional  jurisdic- 
tions are  only  allocated  powers  not  specifically  reserved  to  the 
federal  government  or  exercised  jointly.  Those  powers  include 
managing  municipal  property,  establishing  and  executing 
regional  budgets,  establishing  and  collecting  regional  taxes, 
and  maintaining  law  and  order  (see  table  25,  Appendix).  Some 
of  the  boundaries  between  joint  and  exclusively  federal  powers 
are  vaguely  prescribed;  presumably  they  would  become  clearer 
through  the  give  and  take  of  federal  practice  or  through  adju- 
dication, as  has  occurred  in  other  federal  systems.  Meanwhile, 
bilateral  power-sharing  treaties  between  the  central  govern- 
ment and  the  subunits  have  become  an  important  means  of 
clarifying  the  boundaries  of  shared  powers.  Many  subnational 
jurisdictions  have  their  own  constitutions,  however,  and  often 
those  documents  allocate  powers  to  the  jurisdiction  inconsis- 
tent with  provisions  of  the  federal  constitution.  As  of  1996,  no 
process  had  been  devised  for  adjudication  of  such  conflicts. 

Under  the  1993  constitution,  the  republics,  territories, 
oblasts,  autonomous  oblast,  autonomous  regions,  and  cities  of 
federal  designation  are  held  to  be  "equal  in  their  relations  with 
the  federal  agencies  of  state  power";  this  language  represents 
an  attempt  to  end  the  complaints  of  the  nonrepublic  jurisdic- 
tions about  their  inferior  status.  In  keeping  with  this  new  equal- 
ity, republics  no  longer  receive  the  epithet  "sovereign,"  as  they 
did  in  the  1978  constitution.  Equal  representation  in  the  Fed- 
eration Council  for  all  eighty-nine  jurisdictions  furthers  the 
equalization  process  by  providing  them  meaningful  input  into 
legislative  activities,  particularly  those  of  special  local  concern 
(see  The  Parliament,  this  ch.).  However,  Federation  Council 
officials  have  criticized  the  State  Duma  for  failing  to  represent 
regional  interests  adequately.  In  mid-1995  Vladimir  Shumeyko, 
then  speaker  of  the  Federation  Council,  criticized  the  current 
electoral  system's  party-list  provision  for  allowing  some  parts  of 
Russia  to  receive  disproportionate  representation  in  the  lower 
house.  (In  the  1995  elections,  Moscow  Oblast  received  nearly 
38  percent  of  the  State  Duma's  seats  based  on  the  concentra- 
tion of  party-list  candidates  in  the  national  capital.)  Shumeyko 
contended  that  such  misallocation  fed  potentially  dangerous 
popular  discontent  with  the  parliament  and  politicians  (see 
The  Elections  of  1995,  this  ch.). 


410 


Government  and  Politics 


Despite  constitutional  language  equalizing  the  regional 
jurisdictions  in  their  relations  with  the  center,  vestiges  of  Soviet- 
era  multitiered  federalism  remain  in  a  number  of  provisions, 
including  those  allowing  for  the  use  of  non-Russian  languages 
in  the  republics  but  not  in  other  jurisdictions,  and  in  the  defi- 
nitions of  the  five  categories  of  subunit.  On  most  details  of  the 
federal  system,  the  constitution  is  vague,  and  clarifying  legisla- 
tion had  not  been  passed  by  mid-1996.  However,  some  analysts 
have  pointed  out  that  this  vagueness  facilitates  resolution  of 
individual  conflicts  between  the  center  and  the  regions. 

Power  Sharing 

Flexibility  is  a  goal  of  the  constitutional  provision  allowing 
bilateral  treaties  or  charters  between  the  central  government 
and  the  regions  on  power  sharing.  For  instance,  in  the  bilateral 
treaty  signed  with  the  Russian  government  in  February  1994, 
the  Republic  of  Tatarstan  gave  up  its  claim  to  sovereignty  and 
accepted  Russia's  taxing  authority,  in  return  for  Russia's  accep- 
tance of  Tatar  control  over  oil  and  other  resources  and  the 
republic's  right  to  sign  economic  agreements  with  other  coun- 
tries. This  treaty  has  particular  significance  because  Tatarstan 
was  one  of  the  two  republics  that  did  not  sign  the  Federation 
Treaty  in  1992.  By  mid-1996  almost  one-third  of  the  federal 
subunits  had  concluded  power-sharing  treaties  or  charters. 

The  first  power-sharing  charter  negotiated  by  the  central 
government  and  an  oblast  was  signed  in  December  1995  with 
Orenburg  Oblast.  The  charter  divided  power  in  the  areas  of 
economic  and  agricultural  policy,  natural  resources,  interna- 
tional economic  relations  and  trade,  and  military  industries. 
According  to  Prime  Minister  Chernomyrdin,  the  charter  gave 
Orenburg  full  power  over  its  budget  and  allowed  the  oblast  to 
participate  in  privatization  decisions.  By  early  1996,  similar 
charters  had  been  signed  with  Krasnodar  Territory  and  Kalin- 
ingrad and  Sverdlovsk  oblasts.  In  the  summer  of  1996,  Yeltsin 
wooed  potential  regional  supporters  of  his  reelection  by  sign- 
ing charters  with  Perm',  Rostov,  Tver',  and  Leningrad  oblasts 
and  with  the  city  of  St.  Petersburg,  among  others,  granting 
these  regions  liberal  tax  treatment  and  other  economic  advan- 
tages. 

By  the  mid-1990s,  regional  jurisdictions  also  had  become 
bolder  in  passing  local  legislation  to  fill  gaps  in  federation  stat- 
utes rather  than  waiting  for  the  Federal  Assembly  to  act.  For 
example,  Volgograd  Oblast  passed  laws  regulating  local  pen- 


411 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

sions,  the  issuance  of  promissory  notes,  and  credit  unions.  The 
constitution  upholds  regional  legislative  authority  to  pass  laws 
that  accord  with  the  constitution  and  existing  federal  laws. 

Presidential  Power  in  the  Regions 

The  president  retains  the  power  to  appoint  and  remove  pres- 
idential representatives,  who  act  as  direct  emissaries  to  the 
jurisdictions  in  overseeing  local  administrations'  implementa- 
tion of  presidential  policies.  The  power  to  appoint  these  over- 
seers was  granted  by  the  Russian  Supreme  Soviet  to  Yeltsin  in 
late  1991.  The  parliament  attempted  several  times  during 
1992-93  to  repeal  or  curtail  the  activities  of  these  appointees, 
whose  powers  are  only  alluded  to  in  the  constitution.  The  pres- 
ence of  Yeltsin's  representatives  helped  bring  out  the  local  vote 
on  his  behalf  in  the  1996  presidential  election. 

The  governments  of  the  republics  include  a  president  or 
prime  minister  (or  both)  and  a  regional  council  or  legislature. 
The  chief  executives  of  lower  jurisdictions  are  called  governors 
or  administrative  heads.  Generally,  in  jurisdictions  other  than 
republics  the  executive  branches  have  been  more  sympathetic 
to  the  central  government,  and  the  legislatures  (called  Soviets 
until  late  1993,  then  called  dumas  or  assemblies)  have  been  the 
center  of  whatever  separatist  sentiment  exists.  Under  the  power 
given  him  in  1991  to  appoint  the  chief  executives  of  territories, 
oblasts,  autonomous  regions,  and  the  autonomous  oblast, 
Yeltsin  had  appointed  virtually  all  of  the  sixty-six  leaders  of 
those  jurisdictions.  By  contrast,  republic  presidents  have  been 
popularly  elected  since  1992.  Some  of  Yeltsin's  appointees  have 
encountered  strong  opposition  from  their  legislatures;  in  1992 
and  1993,  in  some  cases  votes  of  no-confidence  brought  about 
popular  elections  for  the  position  of  chief  executive. 

After  the  Moscow  confrontation  of  October  1993,  Yeltsin 
sought  to  bolster  his  regional  support  by  dissolving  the  legisla- 
tures of  all  federal  subunits  except  the  republics  (which  were 
advised  to  "reform"  their  political  systems).  Accordingly,  in 
1994  elections  were  held  in  all  the  jurisdictions  whose  legisla- 
tures had  been  dismissed.  In  some  cases,  that  process  placed 
local  executives  at  the  head  of  legislative  bodies,  eliminating 
checks  and  balances  between  the  branches  at  the  regional 
level. 

Election  results  in  the  subnational  jurisdictions  held  great 
significance  for  the  Yeltsin  administration  because  the  winners 
would  fill  the  ex  officio  seats  in  the  Federation  Council,  which 


412 


Government  and  Politics 


until  1996  was  a  reliable  bastion  of  support.  The  election  of 
large  numbers  of  opposition  candidates  would  end  the  Federa- 
tion Council's  usefulness  as  a  balance  against  the  anti-Yeltsin 
State  Duma  and  further  impede  Yeltsin's  agenda.  In  1995  some 
regions  held  gubernatorial  elections  to  fill  the  administrative 
posts  originally  granted  to  Yeltsin  appointees  in  1991.  Faced 
with  an  escalating  number  of  requests  for  such  elections, 
Yeltsin  decreed  December  1996  as  the  date  for  most  gubernato- 
rial and  republic  presidential  elections.  This  date  was  con- 
firmed by  a  December  1995  Federation  Council  law.  The 
decree  also  set  subnational  legislative  elections  for  June  or 
December  1997.  (In  July  1996,  the  State  Duma  advanced  these 
elections  to  late  1996.)  Observers  noted  that  by  calling  for  most 
of  these  elections  to  take  place  after  the  presidential  election, 
Yeltsin  prevented  unfavorable  outcomes  from  possibly  reduc- 
ing his  reelection  chances — even  though  voter  apathy  after  the 
presidential  election  had  the  potential  to  help  opposition  can- 
didates. 

The  Separatism  Question 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  observers  speculated  about  the 
possibility  that  some  of  the  jurisdictions  in  the  federation 
might  emulate  the  former  Soviet  republics  and  demand  full 
independence  (see  Minority  Peoples  and  Their  Territories,  ch. 
4).  Several  factors  militate  against  such  an  outcome,  however. 
Russia  is  more  than  80  percent  ethnic  Russian,  and  most  of  the 
thirty-two  ethnically  based  jurisdictions  are  demographically 
dominated  by  ethnic  Russians,  as  are  all  of  the  territories  and 
oblasts.  Many  of  the  subnational  jurisdictions  are  in  the  inte- 
rior of  Russia,  meaning  that  they  could  not  break  away  without 
joining  a  bloc  of  seceding  border  areas,  and  the  economies  of 
all  such  jurisdictions  were  thoroughly  integrated  with  the 
national  economy  in  the  Soviet  system.  The  1993  constitution 
strengthens  the  official  status  of  the  central  government  in 
relation  to  the  various  regions,  although  Moscow  has  made  sig- 
nificant concessions  in  bilateral  treaties.  Finally,  most  of  the  dif- 
ferences at  the  base  of  separatist  movements  are  economic  and 
geographic  rather  than  ethnic. 

Advocates  of  secession,  who  are  numerous  in  several  regions, 
generally  appear  to  be  in  the  minority  and  are  unevenly  dis- 
persed. Some  regions  have  even  advocated  greater  centraliza- 
tion on  some  matters.  By  1996  most  experts  believed  that  the 
federation  would  hold  together,  although  probably  at  the 


413 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

expense  of  additional  concessions  of  power  by  the  central  gov- 
ernment. The  trend  is  not  toward  separatism  so  much  as  the 
devolution  of  central  powers  to  the  localities  on  trade,  taxes, 
and  other  matters. 

Some  experts  observe  that  the  Russian  republics  pressing 
claims  for  greater  subunit  rights  fall  into  three  groups.  The  first 
is  composed  of  those  jurisdictions  most  vociferous  in  pressing 
ethnic  separatism,  including  Chechnya  and  perhaps  other 
republics  of  the  North  Caucasus,  and  the  Republic  of  Tyva.  The 
second  group  consists  of  large,  resource-rich  republics,  includ- 
ing Karelia,  Komi,  and  Sakha  (Yakutia) .  Their  differences  with 
Moscow  center  on  resource  control  and  taxes  rather  than 
demands  for  outright  independence.  A  third,  mixed  group 
consists  of  republics  along  the  Volga  River,  which  straddle  stra- 
tegic water,  rail,  and  pipeline  routes,  possess  resources  such  as 
oil,  and  include  large  numbers  of  Russia's  Muslim  and  Bud- 
dhist populations.  These  republics  include  Bashkortostan, 
Kalmykia,  Mari  El,  Mordovia,  Tatarstan,  and  Udmurtia. 

In  addition  to  the  republics,  several  other  jurisdictions  have 
lobbied  for  greater  rights,  mainly  on  questions  of  resource  con- 
trol and  taxation.  These  include  Sverdlovsk  Oblast,  which  in 
1993  proclaimed  itself  an  autonomous  republic  as  a  protest 
against  receiving  fewer  privileges  in  taxation  and  resource  con- 
trol than  the  republics,  and  strategically  vital  Maritime  (Pri- 
morskiy)  Territory  on  the  Pacific  coast,  whose  governor  in  the 
mid-1990s,  Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko,  defied  central  economic 
and  political  policies  on  a  number  of  well-publicized  issues. 

Some  limited  cooperation  has  occurred  among  Russia's 
regional  jurisdictions,  and  experts  believe  there  is  potential  for 
even  greater  coordination.  Eight  regional  cooperation  organi- 
zations have  been  established,  covering  all  subnational  jurisdic-

Caucasus  Republics,  Territories,  and  Oblasts;  the  Greater  Volga 
Association;  the  Ural  Regional  Association;  and  the  Far  East 
and  Baikal  Association.  The  Federation  Council  formally  rec- 
ognized these  interjurisdictional  organizations  in  1994.  Expan- 
sion of  the  organizations'  activities  is  hampered  by  economic 
inequalities  among  their  members  and  by  inadequate  interre- 
gional transportation  infrastructure,  but  in  1996  they  began 
increasing  their  influence  in  Moscow.

Government  and  Politics 


Regional  and  ethnic  conflicts  have  encouraged  proposals  to 
abolish  the  existing  subunits  and  resurrect  the  tsarist-era 
guberniya,  or  large  province,  which  would  incorporate  several 
smaller  subunits  on  the  basis  of  geography  and  population 
rather  than  ethnic  considerations.  Russian  ultranationalists 
such  as  Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy  have  been  joined  in  supporting 
this  proposal  by  some  officials  of  the  national  Government  and 
oblast  and  territory  leaders  who  resent  the  privileges  of  the 
republics.  Some  have  called  for  these  new  subunits  to  be  based 
on  the  eight  interregional  economic  associations. 

Political  Parties  and  Legislative  Elections 

After  early  1990,  when  the  Soviet  constitution  was  amended 
to  delete  the  provision  that  the  CPSU  was  the  "leading  and 
guiding"  force  in  the  political  system,  many  political  groups 
began  to  operate  more  openly  in  Russia.  The  constitution  of 
1993  guarantees  Russians'  right  to  a  multiparty  system.  Political 
party  development  has  lagged,  however,  because  many  Rus- 
sians associate  parties  with  the  repressiveness  of  the  CPSU  in 
the  Soviet  era.  In  the  mid-1990s,  most  of  Russia's  parties  were 
based  on  personal  followings,  had  few  formal  members,  and 
lacked  broad  geographical  bases  and  coherent  platforms.  Prior 
to  the  legislative  elections  of  1993  and  1995,  much  shifting 
occurred  as  parties  formed  and  abandoned  coalitions,  some- 
times involving  partners  with  which  they  had  little  in  common 
politically.  Even  the  KPRF,  direct  heir  to  the  CPSU,  waffled  on 
many  central  economic  and  foreign  policy  issues  in  the  1996 
presidential  campaign.  One  observer  noted  that  for  most  Rus- 
sian voters,  the  two  major  sides  in  the  1996  election  had  no 
identification  with  broad  national  issues;  they  were  simply  the 
anti- Yeltsins  and  the  anti-communists.  Experts  identified  the 
lack  of  focused  national  party  organizations  as  a  key  factor  in 
the  diffusion  of  political  power  to  subnational  jurisdictions  in 
the  mid-1990s  (see  The  Federation  Treaty  and  Regional  Power, 
this  ch.). 

The  Elections  of  1 993 

In  November  1993,  Yeltsin  issued  decrees  prescribing  proce- 
dures for  multiparty  parliamentary  elections,  which  would  be 
the  first  since  tsarist  times.  Besides  setting  the  configuration  of 
the  new  bicameral  parliament,  the  Yeltsin  plan  called  for  half 
of  the  450  State  Duma  deputies  to  be  elected  from  national 


415 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

party  lists  with  representation  proportional  to  the  overall  votes 
received  by  each  party.  The  other  half  would  be  elected  locally, 
in  single-member  districts  (see  The  Parliament,  this  ch.).  The 
party-list  procedure,  a  new  feature  in  Russian  elections,  was 
designed  to  strengthen  the  identification  of  candidates  with 
parties  and  to  foster  the  concept  of  the  multiparty  system 
among  the  electorate.  To  achieve  proportional  representation 
in  the  State  Duma,  a  party  would  need  to  gain  at  least  5  percent 
of  the  nationwide  vote. 

The  CEC  declared  thirteen  parties  eligible  for  the  party  list, 
and  2,047  individual  candidates  were  selected  to  compete  for 
Federation  Council  seats  (490)  and  State  Duma  single-mandate 
seats  (1,567),  allotted  to  individuals  regardless  of  their  parties' 
overall  performance  vis-a-vis  the  5  percent  threshold.  Although 
the  CEC  reported  some  voting  irregularities,  the  vast  majority 
of  the  more  than  1,000  international  observers  termed  the 
elections  largely  free  and  fair,  with  some  reservations  expressed 
about  manipulation  of  results.  In  several  republics,  the  referen- 
dum results  were  invalidated  by  low  turnouts  caused  by  boy- 
cotts, or  because  voters  failed  to  approve  the  constitution. 

Many  experts  divided  the  myriad  parties  of  the  1993  elec- 
tions roughly  into  three  main  blocs:  pro-Yeltsin  reformists,  cen- 
trists advocating  a  slower  pace  of  reform,  and  hard-liners 
opposing  reforms.  The  main  reformist  party  was  Russia's 
Choice,  led  by  former  prime  minister  Yegor  Gaydar.  The  main 
centrist  parties  were  the  Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin  bloc,  com- 
monly referred  to  as  Yabloko  (the  Russian  word  for  apple), 
headed  by  economist  Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy  and  former  ambassa- 
dor to  the  United  States  Vladimir  Lukin,  and  the  Democratic 
Party  of  Russia,  headed  by  Nikolay  Travkin.  The  main  hard-line 
parties  were  the  LDPR,  the  KPRF,  headed  by  Gennadiy  Zyuga- 
nov, and  the  Agrarian  Party,  which  represented  state-  and  col- 
lective-farm interests  and  was  headed  by  Mikhail  Lapshin. 

In  1993  the  strongly  nationalist,  antireform  LDPR  emerged 
with  the  largest  vote  on  the  State  Duma  party  lists,  followed  by 
Russia's  Choice.  By  faring  much  better  in  the  single-member 
districts,  however,  Russia's  Choice  emerged  with  sixty-six  seats, 
the  most  in  the  State  Duma.  The  LDPR  followed  with  sixty-four 
seats.  Altogether,  reformist  and  centrist  parties  emerged  with 
the  greatest  number  of  seats  in  the  State  Duma,  followed  by 
nationalist  and  antireform  parties.  Some  127  State  Duma  seats 
were  won  by  individuals  not  formally  affiliated  with  a  party, 
many  of  whom  were  former  CPSU  members. 


416 


Government  and  Politics 


Of  the  thirteen  parties  participating  in  the  December  1993 
legislative  elections  on  the  party  lists,  eight  exceeded  the  5  per- 
cent threshold  to  win  seats  in  the  State  Duma.  In  addition,  all 
thirteen  parties,  as  well  as  some  local  parties,  won  seats  in  sin- 
gle-member districts.  Once  the  new  parliament  was  seated,  the 
parties  aggregated  into  several  factions.  A  number  of  deputies 
coalesced  into  the  Union  of  December  12  faction.  Sixty-five 
centrist  deputies  formed  the  New  Regional  Policy  faction,  and 
some  LDPR  members  shifted  their  affiliation  to  the  KPRF  or 
the  Agrarian  Party,  or  supported  former  vice  president  Alek- 
sandr  Rutskoy's  Concord  in  the  Name  of  Russia  policy  agenda. 

The  Elections  of  1 995 

In  June  1995,  the  Federal  Assembly  passed — and  Yeltsin 
signed — a  new  law  to  govern  the  next  legislative  elections, 
which  were  planned  for  December.  This  legislation  echoed 
many  provisions  of  Yeltsin's  1993  electoral  decree,  such  as  the 
division  of  the  State  Duma  seats  into  party-list  and  single-mem- 
ber districts.  Yeltsin  had  urged  a  change  in  this  provision 
because  he  feared  that  Zhirinovskiy's  LDPR  might  again  gain 
many  seats  in  the  party-list  voting,  but  the  Duma  had  insisted 
on  retaining  the  even-split  voting  procedure  that  gave  such 
meaning  to  the  party  lists.  The  1993  election  had  demonstrated 
that  voting  by  party  lists  generally  encouraged  party  formation 
and  program  pledges,  whereas  voting  by  district  encouraged 
loyalty  by  deputies  to  local  interests.  The  5  percent  threshold 
for  party-list  voting  also  was  retained.  In  September  1995, 
Yeltsin  decreed  that  the  Federation  Council  seats  would  not  be 
filled  by  regional  elections;  instead,  the  upper  house  would  be 
composed  of  regional  and  republic  executive  and  legislative 
leaders — a  group  with  which  Yeltsin  had  close  contacts  and 
from  which  he  could  expect  strong  loyalty.  All  of  the  suggested 
provisions  were  incorporated  into  the  new  election  law  (see 
The  Parliament,  this  ch.). 

In  anticipation  of  the  legislative  races,  early  in  1995  Yeltsin 
encouraged  the  creation  of  two  political  parties  that  would 
lend  support  to  his  policies  and  form  the  basis  of  a  stable,  mod- 
erate, two-party  system  in  Russia.  One  party  would  be  led  by 
State  Duma  speaker  Ivan  Rybkin,  the  other  by  Chernomyrdin 
(who  by  that  time  had  proven  himself  a  loyal  and  competent 
manager  of  the  Yeltsin  agenda).  The  unnamed  "Rybkin  bloc" 
was  designed  to  attract  centrist  and  leftist  voters,  and  Cherno- 
mydin's  party,  Our  Home  Is  Russia,  was  envisioned  as  a  right- 


417 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

center  coalition.  Both  parties  would  occupy  the  moderate  band 
of  the  political  spectrum.  Having  attracted  the  support  of  many 
Russian  Government  ministers  and  regional  leaders,  Our 
Home  Is  Russia  became  known  as  the  "party  of  power."  The 
Rybkin  bloc,  which  was  supposed  to  serve  as  the  loyal  opposi- 
tion in  the  parliament,  attracted  several  tiny  parties,  but  major 
parties  and  groups  refused  to  join  the  bloc  because  of  opposi- 
tion to  some  or  all  of  Yeltsin's  reforms.  As  a  result,  Rybkin's  uni- 
fication effort  received  little  practical  support. 

To  qualify  for  the  party-list  voting,  parties  were  required  to 
obtain  200,000  signatures,  with  no  more  than  7  percent  of  sig- 
natures coming  from  any  single  federal  jurisdiction.  The  latter 
requirement  was  designed  to  encourage  the  emergence  of 
broad-based  rather  than  regionally  based  parties.  Candidates 
wishing  to  run  in  single-member  districts  had  to  obtain  signa- 
tures from  at  least  1  percent,  or  about  5,000,  of  their  district's 
voters.  Forty-three  parties  succeeded  in  getting  on  the  party-list 
ballot,  and  more  than  2,600  candidates  were  registered  in  225 
single-member  district  races.  Many  individuals  listed  on  the 
party  ballot  also  ran  in  single-member  districts.  This  was  espe- 
cially true  of  locally  popular  candidates  whose  minor  parties 
could  not  surpass  the  5  percent  national  threshold  needed  to 
get  on  the  national  party-list  ballot. 

In  the  legislative  elections  of  December  1995,  voter  turnout 
was  high  (about  65  percent),  and  international  observers  again 
evaluated  the  balloting  as  largely  free  and  fair.  The  second  such 
evaluation  in  two  years  boosted  the  image  of  electoral  democ- 
ratization in  Russia.  Dissatisfaction  with  the  Yeltsin  administra- 
tion was  conspicuous  in  the  election  results,  but  the  showing  of 
the  reformist  and  centrist  parties  that  supported  some  or  all  of 
Yeltsin's  program  was  undermined  by  the  disunity  of  that  part 
of  the  political  spectrum.  Among  the  forty-three  parties  partici- 
pating in  the  party-list  vote,  only  four  met  the  5  percent 
requirement  to  win  seats  for  their  national  party  lists,  although 
several  other  parties  won  seats  in  individual  races.  In  the  aggre- 
gate of  party-list  voting,  reformists  and  centrists  performed 
much  better  than  they  did  in  the  single-member  phase,  receiv- 
ing almost  as  many  votes  as  the  hard-liners.  But  pro-reform  and 
centrist  votes  were  dispersed  among  a  multitude  of  parties, 
negating  almost  two-thirds  of  the  party-list  votes  they  received 
and  costing  these  parties  dozens  of  seats  by  keeping  them 
below  the  5  percent  threshold.  In  contrast,  the  KPRF  and  its 


418 


Government  and  Politics 


allies  suffered  much  less  from  such  dispersion  and  gained 
many  seats  from  the  party-list  vote. 

Although  centrists  and  reformers  split  single-mandate  seats 
about  evenly  with  the  antireform  parties,  nonaffiliated  candi- 
dates gained  more  than  one-third  of  these  seats.  About  40  per- 
cent of  the  sitting  State  Duma  deputies  were  reelected,  and 
fifteen  Federation  Council  deputies  entered  the  State  Duma, 
providing  some  continuity  of  legislative  expertise.  Under  a  pro- 
vision of  the  new  constitution,  Government  officials  were  obli- 
gated to  resign  their  positions  if  elected  to  the  parliament. 

Overall,  reformist  parties  did  not  do  as  well  in  the  1995  elec- 
tions as  they  had  in  1993.  Gaydar's  party,  now  renamed  Russia's 
Democratic  Choice,  failed  to  meet  the  5  percent  requirement. 
Altogether,  reformists  and  centrists  won  129  seats  in  the  State 
Duma  (less  than  one-third  of  the  total),  and  independent, 
nominally  nonaffiliated  candidates  won  seventy-seven  seats 
(about  one-sixth).  The  KPRF  and  its  ally,  the  Agrarian  Party, 
gained  179  seats  as  the  KPRF  achieved  a  plurality  of  seats,  and 
the  anti-Yeltsin  nationalist  parties  won  another  sixty-five. 
Zhirinovskiy's  LDPR  received  much  less  electoral  support  than 
in  1993,  gaining  11  percent  of  the  vote — a  distant  second  to  the 
KPRF — and  fifty-one  seats  (see  table  26,  Appendix). 

More  than  in  the  1993  alignment,  parties  now  tended  to  be 
either  for  or  against  reform,  with  former  centrists  moving 
either  left  or  right.  In  the  1996  State  Duma,  the  main  reformist 
parties  were  Chernomyrdin's  "official"  Our  Home  Is  Russia,  the 
main  advocate  of  Yeltsin's  programs,  and  Yavlinskiy's  Yabloko 
coalition,  which  was  highly  critical  of  Yeltsin's  approach  to 
reform  but  supportive  of  reform  principles.  The  main  hard- 
line, antireform  parties  in  the  Duma  were  the  KPRF,  headed  by 
Zyuganov,  and  the  LDPR,  headed  by  Zhirinovskiy. 

Altogether,  in  1996  communist,  nationalist,  and  agrarian 
parties  controlled  slightly  more  than  half  the  State  Duma  seats. 
Their  strength  enabled  them  to  pass  some  bills  and  resolutions 
if  they  voted  together,  but  they  still  lacked  enough  votes  to 
override  Federation  Council  votes  or  presidential  vetoes  (see 
The  Executive  Branch,  this  ch.).  The  numerical  proportions 
also  did  not  permit  antireformists  to  approve  changes  in  the 
constitution,  which  require  a  two-thirds  majority,  that  is,  at  least 
300  votes  of  the  full  chamber. 

Civil  Rights 

The  constitution  of  1993  includes  a  wide  range  of  provisions 


419 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

guaranteeing  the  civil  and  human  rights  of  Russia's  citizens. 
However,  inadequacies  in  the  criminal  justice  system  and  other 
institutional  flaws  have  hindered  consistent  observance  of 
those  provisions. 

General  Civil  Rights  Guarantees 

The  constitution  establishes  wide-ranging  civil  and  human 
rights  and  social  guarantees,  several  of  which  remained  unat- 
tainable or  unrealized  in  the  mid-1990s.  Social  guarantees  have 
been  difficult  to  meet  because  of  Russia's  persistent  economic 
crisis.  Such  guarantees  include  the  right  to  a  minimum  wage 
and  welfare  for  the  "family,  mothers,  fathers,  children,  invalids, 
and  elderly  citizens."  Protection  of  unemployed  people  and  the 
right  to  a  safe  and  hygienic  work  environment  also  are  pro- 
claimed. The  right  to  housing  is  guaranteed,  including  free  or 
low-cost  housing  for  needy  people  and  others.  The  right  to  free 
health  care  and  secondary-level  education  is  also  upheld,  in  an 
echo  of  the  promises  of  Soviet  constitutions.  Perhaps  in  recog- 
nition of  the  economic  burden  of  such  widely  inclusive  state 
social  guarantees,  the  constitution  calls  for  adult  children  to 
care  for  disabled  parents,  and  it  safeguards  the  existence  of  pri- 
vate charitable  and  insurance  operations,  which  were  forbid- 
den or  discouraged  under  the  Soviet  system. 

Equality  before  the  law  is  proclaimed  regardless  of  sex,  race, 
nationality,  language,  national  origin,  property  and  position, 
ideological  conviction,  membership  in  public  associations,  and 
other  attributes  and  circumstances.  Freedom  of  religion  and 
conscience  is  upheld,  and  alternatives  to  military  service  are  to 
be  accepted,  although  neither  the  law  in  force  nor  military 
practice  has  upheld  the  latter  provision.  Individual  privacy  is 
protected,  including  that  of  correspondence  and  other  com- 
munications and  of  housing.  Nationality  rights  are  upheld, 
including  the  right  to  use  a  language  other  than  Russian  in 
communications  and  education.  The  constitution  asserts  free- 
dom of  internal  and  foreign  travel  and  the  right  to  choose 
one's  place  of  domicile.  No  one  may  be  expelled  or  exiled  from 
Russia.  Freedom  of  the  press  is  upheld,  and  censorship  is  pro- 
hibited. People  have  the  right  to  assemble  peaceably  and  to 
hold  peaceful  meetings  and  demonstrations  of  all  types.  The 
right  to  own,  dispose  of,  and  inherit  private  property,  including 
land,  is  upheld,  and  private  property  may  not  be  expropriated 
except  with  full  compensation. 


420 


Government  and  Politics 


Constitutionally  guaranteed  civil  rights  may  only  be 
restricted  upon  the  legal  proclamation  of  a  national  or  local 
state  of  emergency.  Even  in  a  state  of  emergency,  however,  the 
constitution  prescribes  that  no  one  may  be  tortured  or  denied 
judicial  rights,  although  an  individual  may  be  held  for  an 
unspecified  period  without  being  charged.  The  right  of  dual 
citizenship  for  ethnic  Russians  residing  in  the  near  abroad  (the 
other  fourteen  former  republics  of  the  Soviet  Union)  is  pro- 
claimed. Presumably,  such  a  right  also  exists  for  non-Russians 
residing  in  Russia.  The  constitution  also  includes  a  pledge  that 
Russia  will  protect  its  citizens  abroad.  However,  most  member 
nations  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS) 
have  resisted  Russia's  demand  that  they  grant  ethnic  Russians 
such  dual  citizenship,  viewing  it  as  an  infringement  on  their 
sovereignty  (see  Migration,  ch.  3). 

Massive  civil  and  human  rights  violations  have  been  commit- 
ted in  the  Republic  of  Chechnya  by  Russian  military  units  as 
well  as  by  Chechen  guerrillas,  resulting  in  tens  of  thousands  of 
deaths  and  injuries  and  the  displacement  of  more  than  300,000 
people.  Official  human  rights  monitoring  of  the  conflict  was 
undermined  in  1995  when  the  State  Duma  dismissed  human 
rights  activist  Sergey  Kovalev  as  its  ombudsman  for  human 
rights.  Kovalev  was  removed  because  of  his  strident  condemna- 
tion of  Russian  military  and  police  atrocities  in  Chechnya. 
Kovalev  resigned  as  chairman  of  the  presidential  Human 
Rights  Commission  in  January  1996,  accusing  Yeltsin  of  back- 
tracking on  human  rights  in  Chechnya  and  throughout  Russia. 
No  figure  of  similar  stature  had  filled  Kovalev's  position  as  of 
mid-1996. 

Criminal  Justice  Protections 

According  to  Russia's  1993  constitution,  the  death  penalty  is 
applicable  to  some  crimes  "until  its  abolition"  by  federal  law. 
Although  the  annual  number  of  executions  reportedly  had 
decreased  by  mid-1996,  the  public  outcry  at  Russia's  growing 
crime  wave  made  the  death  penalty  a  politically  sensitive  issue. 
In  cases  where  the  death  penalty  may  be  applied,  the  accused  is 
guaranteed  the  right  to  trial  by  jury,  although  this  provision 
was  only  partly  in  force  in  the  mid-1990s  (see  How  the  System 
Works,  ch.  10).  A  condition  of  Russia's  admittance  to  the  Coun- 
cil of  Europe  (see  Glossary),  which  it  achieved  in  January  1996, 
was  abolition  of  the  death  penalty  within  three  years.  Much 


421 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

international  pressure  was  applied  toward  that  end  both  before 
and  after  Russia  was  approved  for  council  membership. 

For  all  types  of  crime,  punishment  without  trial  and  prosecu- 
tion ex  post  facto  are  forbidden.  The  constitution  also  bars  tor- 
ture and  other  "brutal  or  humiliating"  treatment  and 
punishment.  Citizens  have  nominal  protection  against  arbi- 
trary arrest  without  a  judicial  decision,  and  they  may  not  be 
held  for  more  than  forty-eight  hours  without  being  charged, 
except  in  a  state  of  emergency.  However,  this  constitutional 
provision  has  been  directly  contravened  by  Yeltsin's  1994 
decree  on  combating  organized  crime,  which  allows  police  to 
detain  persons  suspected  of  involvement  with  organized  crime 
for  as  much  as  thirty  days  without  a  criminal  charge  and  with- 
out access  to  a  lawyer.  This  decree  was  used  widely  in  1995  to 
detain  persons  without  judicial  permission  beyond  the  man- 
dated maximum  period.  Russian  human  rights  monitors 
reported  in  1995  that  the  few  detainees  who  were  aware  of 
their  rights  and  complained  of  violations  were  subject  to  beat- 
ings. Nonetheless,  about  one  in  six  cases  of  arrest  was  appealed 
to  the  courts  in  1995,  and  judges  released  one  in  six  of  those 
on  grounds  of  insufficient  evidence  or  breach  of  procedure 
(see  Criminal  Law  Reform  in  the  1990s,  ch.  10). 

According  to  the  constitution,  judicial  sentences  may  be 
appealed  to  higher  courts,  as  may  decisions  of  government 
organs  at  all  levels.  Those  organs  may  be  sued  for  damages 
caused  by  action  or  inaction.  Nominally,  all  citizens  are  guaran- 
teed their  "day  in  court,"  have  the  right  to  choose  their  own 
defense  counsel,  or  may  be  provided  with  free  legal  counsel  if 
required.  Legal  aid  may  be  requested  from  the  earliest 
moment  a  person  is  detained,  placed  in  custody,  or  indicted,  a 
change  from  previous  practice  whereby  the  individual  could 
receive  counsel  only  upon  being  formally  charged  and  after 
being  interrogated.  Few  citizens  are  aware  of  these  rights,  how- 
ever. A  person  is  considered  innocent  until  proven  guilty,  but 
where  jury  trials  do  not  occur,  the  accused  generally  are 
expected  to  prove  their  innocence  rather  than  defend  them- 
selves against  prosecutors'  efforts  to  prove  their  guilt.  In  cases 
where  a  judge  imposes  sentence,  the  average  rate  of  conviction 
is  more  than  99  percent,  as  opposed  to  an  84  percent  convic- 
tion rate  injury  trials.

state  control.  The  major  newspapers,  such  as  Pravda,  Izvestiya, 
Krasnaya  zvezda,  and  Komsomol' skay a  pravda,  were  the  official 
organs  of  party  or  government  agencies,  and  radio  and  televi- 
sion were  state  monopolies.  In  the  late  1980s,  these  monopo- 
lies began  to  weaken  as  stories  such  as  the  Chernobyl'  disaster 
reached  the  public  in  detail,  an  occurrence  that  would  not 
have  been  possible  before  glasnost.  Then,  after  seventy-five 
years  of  state  control,  the  media  began  an  era  of  significantly 
less  restricted  activity  in  1992. 

In  the  post-Soviet  era,  the  news  media  have  played  a  central 
role  in  forming  public  opinion  toward  critical  national  con- 
cerns, including  the  Chechnya  conflict,  the  economic  crisis, 
and  government  policies  and  personalities.  In  the  environment 
of  freewheeling  expression  of  opinion,  public  figures  such  as 
Boris  Yeltsin  and  government  actions  such  as  the  Chechnya 
campaign  have  received  ruthless  criticism,  and  the  deteriora- 
tion of  Russia's  environment,  public  health,  national  defense, 
and  national  economy  has  been  exposed  thoroughly,  if  not 
always  accurately.  However,  the  national  and  local  governments 
have  exerted  heavy  pressure  on  the  print  and  broadcast  media 
to  alter  coverage  of  certain  issues.  Because  most  media  enter- 
prises continue  to  depend  on  government  support,  such  pres- 
sure often  has  been  effective. 

The  Print  Media 

In  the  first  post-Soviet  years,  major  newspapers  presented 
varied  approaches  to  critical  issues.  Among  the  most  influential 
titles  were  Izvestiya  (in  Soviet  times,  the  organ  of  the  Politburo, 
but  after  1991  an  independent  periodical  owned  by  its  employ- 
ees, with  a  daily  circulation  in  1995  of  about  604,765);  Nezavisi- 
maya  gazeta,  1995  daily  circulation  about  50,400;  and  the  weekly 
Argumenty  ifakty  (1995  circulation  about  3.2  million)  (see  table 
27,  Appendix).  But  by  the  mid-1990s,  a  new  atmosphere  of 
intense  competition  was  bringing  rapid  change  to  the  print 
media.  In  1995  an  estimated  10,000  newspapers  and  periodi- 
cals were  registered,  including  more  than  twenty  daily  newspa- 
pers published  in  Moscow.  The  thousands  of  small  regional 
newspapers  that  appeared  after  1991  were  plagued  by  low 
advertising  revenue,  high  production  costs,  an  increasingly 
apathetic  public,  and  intense  pressure  from  local  authorities  to 
slant  content.  But  in  the  mid-1990s,  local  newspapers  gained 
readers  because  of  increased  regional  independence;  they  also 
benefited  from  the  competition  that  television  gave  to  national

newspapers  in  providing  the  regions  with  news  from  Moscow 
and  the  rest  of  the  world. 

In  1995  the  Moscow  daily  Nezavisimaya  gazeta,  which  for  five 
years  remained  true  to  its  name  (the  independent  newspaper) 
by  refusing  advertising  and  state  subsidies,  was  forced  to  close 
because  circulation  had  dropped  to  about  35,000  and  many 
top  journalists  had  left  for  more  lucrative  positions.  The  paper 
subsequently  resumed  publication  under  the  ownership  of  a 
large  bank  consortium  (the  Unified  Bank)  with  close  ties  to  the 
Government.  Pravda,  formerly  the  main  organ  of  the  CPSU 
and  still  representing  antireform  positions,  underwent  numer- 
ous crises  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s.  Purchased  by  a  Greek 
publishing  firm  in  1992,  its  circulation  dropped  from  about  10 
million  in  the  1980s  to  around  165,000  in  1995.  After  changing 
its  name  to  Pravda  5  in  mid-1996,  the  newspaper  broadened  its 
procommunist  position  somewhat.  The  decline  of  Pravda  left 
Sovetskaya  Rossiya  and  Zavtra  as  the  chief  organs  of  the  antire- 
form faction  of  the  legislature. 

Official  organs  still  have  a  place  in  the  media,  however; 
Rossiyskaya  gazeta,  the  heavily  subsidized  organ  of  the  Govern- 
ment, publishes  most  of  that  body's  official  documents,  includ- 
ing laws  and  decrees.  Rossiyskiye  vesti,  organ  of  the  office  of  the 
president,  reaches  about  150,000  Russians  daily.  Both  newspa- 
pers feature  strongly  pro-Government  positions.  The  third  offi- 
cial national  newspaper,  Krasnaya  zvezda,  representing  the 
Ministry  of  Defense,  acquired  a  reputation  in  the  1990s  as 
strongly  pro-Yeltsin. 

Although  Russia's  newspapers  offer  readers  diverse  opinions 
on  most  issues,  the  quality  of  Russian  journalism  remains  rela- 
tively low,  and  objectivity  is  random.  Journalists  generally  do 
not  verify  their  sources  fully  or  are  denied  access  to  relevant 
individuals.  A  1995  official  report  on  press  freedom  indicated 
that  reporters  without  special  connections  have  no  better 
access  to  state  officials  than  their  counterparts  did  in  the  Soviet 
era.  Most  newspapers  make  no  clear  distinction  between  objec- 
tive reports  and  editorials,  and,  according  to  a  1995  report  by 
the  trade  magazine  Zhurnalist,  most  have  some  connection  to  a 
political  party  or  faction. 

The  Broadcast  Media 

In  1992  some  48.5  million  radios  were  in  use  in  Russia. 
Domestic  radio  programming  is  provided  by  two  state  commu- 
nications companies,  the  Federal  Television  and  Radio  Service 


424 


Government  and  Politics 


of  Russia  and  the  All-Russian  Television  and  Radio  Company. 
The  Voice  of  Russia  (Golos  Rossii)  is  the  main  foreign-language 
broadcast  service,  providing  programs  in  thirty  languages, 
including  Arabic,  Chinese,  English,  Japanese,  Farsi,  and  Span- 
ish. 

In  the  1990s,  television  reached  an  increasing  number  of 
Russians  with  increasingly  diversified  programming.  In  1992 
about  55  million  televisions  were  in  use.  For  most  Russians, 
television  is  the  chief  source  of  news.  Television  channels  and 
transmission  facilities  gradually  have  been  privatized,  although 
in  1996  the  most  prominent  "private"  stockholders  were  entre- 
preneurs with  strong  ties  to  the  Yeltsin  administration.  The 
largest  of  the  four  major  networks,  Russian  Public  Television 
(Obshchestvennoye  rossiyskoye  televideniye — ORT,  formerly 
Ostankino),  which  reaches  an  estimated  200  million  people, 
remained  51  percent  state-owned  after  partial  privatization  in 
1994.  However,  ORT  has  offered  regular  programs,  such  as  one 
hosted  by  Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn,  that  are  critical  of  the  Gov- 
ernment. ORT's  news  broadcasts  tend  to  favor  Government 
policies. 

The  second-largest  network,  the  All-Russian  Television  and 
Radio  Company  (Vserossiyskaya  gosudarstvennaya  teleradio- 
kompaniya,  commonly  called  Russia  Television — RTV),  was 
fully  state-owned  in  1996  and  reaches  about  140  million  viewers 
with  relatively  balanced  news  coverage.  The  largest  private  net- 
work is  Independent  Television  (Nezavisimoye  televideniye — 
NTV),  which  reaches  about  100  million  people.  NTV  has 
received  praise  in  the  West  for  unbiased  news  reporting.  Its 
Chechnya  coverage  forced  other  networks  to  abandon  pro- 
Government  reporting  of  the  conflict.  The  TV-6  commercial 
network  brings  its  estimated  70  million  viewers  in  European 
Russia  mainly  entertainment  programs.  Its  founder,  Eduard 
Sagalayev,  was  strongly  influenced  by  an  earlier  partnership 
with  United  States  communications  magnate  Ted  Turner. 

Besides  the  four  networks,  state-run  channels  are  offered  in 
every  region,  and  an  estimated  400  private  television  stations 
were  in  operation  in  1995.  More  than  half  of  such  stations  pro- 
duce their  own  news  broadcasts,  providing  mainly  local  rather 
than  national  or  international  coverage.  The  Independent 
Broadcasting  System  was  established  in  1994  to  link  some  fifty 
stations  with  shared  programming. 

By  1995  the  administration  of  state  television  had  become 
heavily  politicized.  After  the  1995  legislative  elections,  Yeltsin 


425 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

dismissed  Oleg  Poptsov,  the  head  of  RTV,  for  having  aired  what 
the  president  considered  unfairly  negative  coverage  of  his 
administration.  In  exerting  such  overt  political  pressure, 
Yeltsin  likely  had  in  mind  the  prominent  role  television  would 
play  in  the  1996  presidential  election.  In  fact,  all  candidates  in 
that  election  were  represented  in  an  unprecedented  wave  of 
televised  campaign  advertising,  some  of  which  was  quite  similar 
to  that  in  the  United  States  and  little  of  which  provided  useful 
information  to  voters.  Convinced  that  their  independence 
would  be  jeopardized  if  KPRF  candidate  Gennadiy  Zyuganov 
won,  television  broadcasters  provided  virtually  no  coverage  of 
his  main  campaign  events,  and  even  the  independent  NTV 
aided  Yeltsin  by  muting  its  criticism  during  the  election.  Criti- 
cal coverage  of  the  Chechen  conflict  and  other  issues  resumed 
once  Yeltsin's  reelection  seemed  assured,  however. 

The  Political  Outlook 

Russia's  political  culture  made  long  strides  toward  democ- 
racy in  the  first  five  years  of  the  post-Soviet  era.  By  mid-1996 
numerous  political  parties  with  widely  varying  agendas  and 
viewpoints  had  participated  in  three  free  national  elections — 
two  legislative,  one  presidential.  Although  the  sitting  president 
enjoyed  a  distinct  advantage  in  media  coverage,  all  sides  agreed 
after  the  1996  election  that  the  people  had  spoken.  Observers 
noted  the  similarity  of  the  1996  campaign  to  those  in  the  West, 
including  barnstorming  speeches,  generous  promises  to  spe- 
cial interests,  and  ample  use  of  "photo  opportunities."  Never  in 
the  history  of  Russia  had  a  head  of  state  been  subjected  to 
open  public  evaluation  and  then  been  peacefully  assured  of  a 
new  term  in  power.  Certainly  this  was  a  complete  reversal  of  the 
Soviet  Union's  programmed,  one-party  political  rituals. 

Although  the  process  of  choosing  a  leader  has  been  democ- 
ratized, the  process  of  governance  remains  a  hybrid  of  Soviet 
and  Western  practices.  The  first  administration  of  Boris  Yeltsin 
was  a  combination  of  bold  democratic  initiatives  and  secretive 
decision  making  by  committees  and  individuals  beyond  public 
view  and  responsibility.  As  criticism  of  Yeltsin  grew  in  1993  and 
1994,  his  hold  on  power  depended  increasingly  on  presidential 
decrees  rather  than  on  open  consultation  with  other  branches 
of  government  or  with  the  Russian  people.  Yeltsin's  relatively 
easy  reelection  in  mid-1996  fueled  hopes  that  a  second  admin- 
istration would  revive  some  of  the  democratic  processes  that 
had  enthused  Russians  as  Yeltsin  struggled  with  Gorbachev  for 


426 


Government  and  Politics 


Russia's  sovereignty  before  the  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union.  As  a 
leader,  however,  Yeltsin  showed  little  interest  in  the  routine  of 
day-to-day  governance,  and  he  often  exercised  poor  judgment 
in  delegating  authority.  Meanwhile,  a  formidable  array  of  anti- 
reform  factions  retained  their  power  base  in  the  State  Duma, 
and  Yeltsin's  precarious  health  further  endangered  the  contin- 
uation of  his  reform  program. 

According  to  many  analysts,  the  long-term  well-being  of  Rus- 
sia's political  system  will  be  determined  by  the  next  generation 
of  political  figures,  who  will  not  have  been  schooled  in  Soviet- 
style  power  politics.  The  question  is  how  well  democratic  insti- 
tutions will  fare  in  the  meantime.

ONCE  A  PARIAH  DENIED  DIPLOMATIC  RECOGNITION  by 
most  countries,  the  Soviet  Union  progressed  from  being  an 
outsider  in  international  organizations  and  negotiations  dur- 
ing the  interwar  period  to  being  one  of  the  arbiters  of  Europe's 
fate  after  World  War  II.  The  Soviet  Union  had  official  relations 
with  the  majority  of  nations  by  the  late  1980s.  In  the  1970s, 
after  achieving  rough  nuclear  parity  with  the  United  States,  the 
Soviet  Union  proclaimed  that  its  own  involvement  was  essential 
to  the  solution  of  any  major  international  problem.  At  that 
time,  regimes  in  countries  containing  about  one-quarter  of  the 
world's  population  emulated  the  socialist  form  of  political  and 
economic  organization  proselytized  by  the  Soviet  Union.  That 
web  of  influence  was  built  upon  the  political  doctrine  of  class 
struggle  and  the  geopolitical  philosophy  of  a  proletarian  inter- 
nationalism that  would  link  together  the  workers  of  the  world. 
Although  the  spirit  of  those  concepts  remained  at  the  base  of 
the  Soviet  Union's  international  attitudes  even  in  1991,  prag- 
matic considerations  often  were  the  primary  determinants  of 
policy  in  specific  cases. 

Among  the  many  bureaucracies  involved  in  the  formation 
and  execution  of  Soviet  foreign  policy,  the  Politburo  of  the 
Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU — see  Glossary) 
determined  the  major  policy  guidelines.  The  foremost  objec- 
tives of  that  foreign  policy  were  the  maintenance  and  enhance- 
ment  of  national  security  and  the  maintenance  of  the 
hegemony  gained  over  Eastern  Europe  following  World  War  II. 
Relations  with  the  United  States  and  with  Western  Europe  also 
were  of  major  concern;  the  strategic  significance  of  individual 
nations  in  the  so-called  Third  World  of  developing  nations 
determined,  at  least  partly,  the  relations  with  those  nations. 

The  Twenty-Seventh  Party  Congress  of  the  CPSU  in  1986 
produced  the  last  formal  enumeration  of  Soviet  foreign  policy 
goals.  That  listing  included  ensuring  favorable  external  condi- 
tions for  building  communism  in  the  Soviet  Union;  eliminating 
the  threat  of  world  war;  disarmament;  strengthening  the 
"world  socialist  system";  developing  equal  and  friendly  relations 
with  so-called  liberated  (Third  World)  countries;  peaceful 
coexistence  with  capitalist  countries;  and  solidarity  with  com- 
munist and  revolutionary-democratic  parties,  the  international 
workers'  movement,  and  national  liberation  struggles. 


431 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  years  that  followed,  the  emphasis  and  ranking  of  these 
priorities  changed  in  response  to  domestic  and  international 
stimuli.  After  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  assumed  power  as  GPSU 
general  secretary  in  1985,  for  instance,  some  Western  analysts 
discerned  in  the  ranking  of  priorities  a  deemphasis  of  Soviet 
support  for  national  liberation  movements.  As  such  shifts 
occurred,  two  basic  goals  of  Soviet  foreign  policy  remained 
constant:  national  security  (safeguarding  CPSU  rule  at  home 
and  maintenance  of  adequate  military  forces)  and  influence 
over  Eastern  Europe. 

After  the  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Russia  claimed  to  be 
the  legal  successor  to  Soviet  foreign  policies.  That  position 
would  allow  Russia  to  assume  a  ready-made  role  as  a  leading 
world  power.  At  the  outset,  Russia  accepted  or  built  upon  many 
tenets  of  the  conciliatory  foreign  policy  toward  the  West  of 
Gorbachev,  the  last  Soviet  leader,  who  had  termed  his  revised 
policy  "New  Thinking."  New  Thinking  defined  international 
politics  in  common  ethical  and  moral  terms  rather  than  mili- 
tary force,  largely  abandoning  the  Marxist-Leninist  (see  Glos- 
sary) idea  that  peaceful  coexistence  was  merely  a  breathing 
spell  in  the  worldwide  class  war.  The  most  important  practical 
result  of  Gorbachev's  approach  came  in  1989  with  the  release 
of  the  Soviet  Union's  forty-four-year  hold  on  the  states  of  East- 
ern Europe.  Superpower  competition  between  the  Soviet 
Union  and  the  United  States,  known  as  the  Cold  War,  gave  way 
to  increased  cooperation  with  the  United  States  on  issues  such 
as  arms  reduction,  peace  in  the  Middle  East,  and  the  Persian 
Gulf  War. 

In  the  early  period  after  Russia  became  independent,  Rus- 
sian foreign  policy  built  upon  Gorbachev's  legacy  by  decisively 
repudiating  Marxism-Leninism  as  a  putative  guide  to  action, 
emphasizing  cooperation  with  the  West  in  solving  regional  and 
global  problems,  and  soliciting  economic  and  humanitarian 
aid  from  the  West  in  support  of  internal  reforms.  In  that  early 
period,  Russian  foreign  policy  defended  itself  against  argu- 
ments from  former  communists  and  ultranationalists  that  Rus- 
sia had  capitulated  to  the  West  and  should  renounce 
entanglements  such  as  Western  foreign  aid.  Russia  also  faced 
the  challenge  of  reconciling  the  international  commitments 
and  obligations  it  inherited  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  with 
new  and  sometimes  conflicting  Russian  interests,  such  as  the 
desire  to  sell  arms  and  missile  technology  abroad.  Although 
Russia's  leaders  described  Europe  as  its  natural  ally,  they  grap- 


432 


Foreign  Relations 


pled  with  defining  new  relations  with  the  East  European  (now 
termed  Central  European)  states,  the  new  states  formed  upon 
the  disintegration  of  Yugoslavia,  and  Western  Europe.  In  Asia, 
Russia  faced  territorial  claims  from  China  and  Japan  at  the 
same  time  that  closer  Russian  relations  with  these  states  and 
the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  and  Taiwan  became  pos- 
sible. Several  challenges  emerged  in  Russia's  relations  with  the 
fourteen  other  former  Soviet  republics,  now  called  the  "near 
abroad."  Among  the  most  serious  confrontations  were  Russia's 
dispute  with  Ukraine  over  the  status  of  Crimea,  long  and  com- 
plicated conflicts  between  Armenia  and  Azerbaijan  and  within 
Georgia,  and  numerous  new  economic  frictions.  The  problem 
of  discrimination  and  ethnic  violence  against  the  25  million 
ethnic  Russians  living  in  the  new  states  was  a  growing  concern 
in  relations  with  several  of  the  former  Soviet  republics,  espe- 
cially those  in  Central  Asia.  Russia  also  faced  adapting  to  and 
competing  with  changing  regional  politics  along  its  borders, 
such  as  the  growing  ties  between  the  Central  Asian  states  and 
Iran  and  Turkey  (see  Federal  Border  Service  and  Border  Secu- 
rity, ch.  10). 

The  Emergence  of  Russian  Foreign  Policy 

The  Russian  Soviet  Federated  Socialist  Republic  (RSFSR)  of 
the  Soviet  Union  began  developing  a  separate  foreign  policy 
and  diplomacy  some  time  before  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet 
Union  at  the  end  of  1991.  The  Russian  Republic  had  possessed 
a  foreign  ministry  and  the  "right"  to  conduct  foreign  policy 
since  the  1936  Soviet  constitution  was  amended  in  1944.  This 
power  remained  undeveloped,  however,  until  the  election  of 
Boris  N.  Yeltsin  as  president  of  Russia  and  Russia's  declaration 
of  sovereignty  in  June  1990.  Among  the  foreign  policy  institu- 
tions and  procedures  that  emerged  in  Russia  in  this  early 
period,  some  paralleled  and  others  competed  with  those  of  the 
Soviet  Union. 

Recognized  by  world  states  and  international  organizations 
as  the  Soviet  Union's  successor  state  after  its  collapse,  Russia 
aggressively  assumed  Soviet  assets  and  most  of  the  Soviet 
Union's  treaty  obligations.  The  assets  included  diplomatic 
properties  worldwide  and  a  large  portion  of  the  existing  diplo- 
matic personnel  staffing  those  posts.  Most  foreign  states  simply 
reassigned  their  ambassadors  from  the  Soviet  Union  to  Russia, 
and  international  organizations  allowed  Russia  to  assume  the 
Soviet  seat.  Most  notably,  Russia  took  over  the  permanent  seat 


433 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  United  Nations  (UN)  Security  Coun- 
cil, which  allowed  it  to  join  the  elite  power  group  with  Britain, 
China,  France,  and  the  United  States. 

The  Search  for  Objectives 

In  early  1992,  Russian  foreign  minister  An  drey  Kozyrev 
announced  that  Russian  foreign  policy  would  differ  from  for- 
eign policy  under  Gorbachev's  New  Thinking  because  demo- 
cratic principles  would  drive  it.  These  principles  would  provide 
a  solid  basis  for  peaceful  policies.  Kozyrev  also  stressed  that  the 
basis  for  the  new  foreign  policy  would  be  Russia's  national 
interests  rather  than  the  so-called  international  class  interests 
that  theoretically  underlay  Soviet  foreign  policy.  For  two  years 
(1992-93),  Russian  foreign  policy  was  generally  low  key  and 
conciliatory  toward  the  West  with  endorsement  of  many  West- 
ern foreign  policy  positions  on  world  conflicts.  Pressing  domes- 
tic problems  were  a  major  determinant  of  this  direction. 
Kozyrev  argued  that  good  relations  with  the  West  were  possible 
because  "no  developed,  democratic,  civil  society  .  .  .  can 
threaten  us." 

Domestic  politics  placed  increasing  pressure  on  this  pro- 
Western  and  generally  benign  attitude.  Bureaucratic  infighting 
broke  out  in  the  government  over  foreign  policy  goals  and  the 
means  of  implementing  them,  and  the  same  questions  stimu- 
lated a  major  conflict  between  the  legislative  and  executive 
branches  of  power.  In  this  period,  conflict  and  confusion  exac- 
erbated or  triggered  foreign  policy  problems  with  Ukraine, 
Japan,  and  the  former  Yugoslavia. 

The  lack  of  clarity  in  many  aspects  of  foreign  policy  also 
reflected  opposing  Russian  viewpoints  over  Russia's  place  in 
the  world.  Public  debates  raged  over  whether  Russia  should  ori- 
ent itself  toward  the  West  or  the  East,  whether  Russia  was  still  a 
superpower,  and  what  the  intentions  of  the  West  were  toward 
Russia — all  indicating  Russia's  general  search  for  a  new  identity 
to  replace  the  accepted  truths  of  Marxism-Leninism  and  the 
Cold  War.  In  the  debate,  ultranationalists  and  communists 
strongly  criticized  what  they  viewed  as  pro-Western  policies  and 
argued  that  close  relations  with  the  West  constituted  a  danger 
to  Russia's  national  security  because  the  West  remained  Russia's 
chief  enemy.  As  early  as  December  1990,  Soviet  foreign  minis- 
ter Eduard  Shevardnadze  had  cited  harsh  criticism  of  his  con- 
ciliatory position  toward  the  West  as  a  major  reason  for  his 
resignation.

Foreign  Relations 


To  allay  Russians'  broad  uncertainty  about  their  country's 
place  in  the  world,  in  early  1992  Kozyrev  presented  the 
Supreme  Soviet  (parliament)  with  his  concept  of  three  main 
foreign  policy  objectives,  but  the  conservative  legislators  did 
not  accept  them.  In  January  1993,  the  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs  prepared  another  draft,  which  also  met  substantial  criti- 
cism. Finally,  in  April  1993,  the  newly  created  Interdepartmen- 
tal Foreign  Policy  Commission  of  the  Security  Council  finalized 
a  foreign  policy  concept  that  the  parliament  approved  (see 
The  Security  Council,  this  ch.). 

According  to  the  1993  foreign  policy  concept,  Russia  is  a 
great  power  with  several  foreign  policy  priorities:  ensuring 
national  security  through  diplomacy;  protecting  the  sover- 
eignty and  unity  of  the  state,  with  special  emphasis  on  border 
stability;  protecting  the  rights  of  Russians  abroad;  providing 
favorable  external  conditions  for  internal  democratic  reforms; 
mobilizing  international  assistance  for  the  establishment  of  a 
Russian  market  economy  and  assisting  Russian  exporters;  fur- 
thering integration  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent 
States  (CIS — see  Glossary)  and  pursuing  beneficial  relations 
with  other  nearby  foreign  states,  including  those  in  Central 
Europe;  continuing  to  build  relations  with  countries  that  have 
resolved  problems  similar  to  those  that  Russia  faces;  and  ensur- 
ing Russia  an  active  role  as  a  great  power.  The  concept  also 
called  for  enhanced  ties  with  Asian  Pacific  countries  to  balance 
relations  with  the  West.  Beginning  in  1993,  public  statements 
about  foreign  policy  placed  greater  emphasis  on  the  protection 
of  Russia's  vital  interests  and  less  emphasis  on  openly  pro-West- 
ern policies. 

The  1993  concept  disclosed  a  dispute  between  liberals  and 
conservatives  over  the  nature  of  Russian  foreign  policy  toward 
the  CIS.  Liberals  warned  of  the  great  human  and  material  costs 
Russia  would  be  forced  to  shoulder  if  it  reabsorbed  the  former 
Soviet  republics,  a  step  the  conservatives  increasingly  advo- 
cated in  the  1990s.  Liberals  argued  that  Russia  could  be  a  great 
power  without  pursuing  that  policy.  Both  liberals  and  conserva- 
tives agreed,  however,  that  Russia  should  play  an  active  role  in 
safeguarding  the  human  rights  of  the  25  million  ethnic  Rus- 
sians who  found  themselves  in  a  foreign  country  for  the  first 
time  after  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union. 

The  1993  foreign-policy  concept  called  for  strengthening  a 
"unified  military  strategic  space"  in  the  CIS  and  protecting  Rus- 
sia's major  interests  there.  It  warned  that  a  third  state's  military- 


435 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

political  presence  in  the  CIS,  or  actions  among  the  CIS  states 
such  as  creation  of  an  economic  or  religious  bloc  of  Central 
Asian  states,  could  negatively  affect  Russia's  interests.  In  the 
case  of  Central  Asia,  this  would  occur  if  ethnic  Russians  were 
forced  to  flee  the  region.  On  a  somewhat  more  liberal  note 
that  showed  its  compromise  quality,  the  concept  recognized 
that  intraregional  cooperation  could  have  positive  results  and 
that  Russia  should  react  to  each  effort  individually.  The  pri- 
macy of  relations  with  the  CIS  was  strengthened  after  the 
December  1993  Russian  legislative  elections,  in  which  national- 
ist factions  expanded  their  power  base. 

For  the  conservatives,  Russian  dominance  was  necessary  to 
secure  southern  borders  and  to  ensure  continued  access  to  the 
waterways,  ports,  and  natural  resources  of  the  newly  indepen- 
dent states.  Some  conservatives  asserted  that  Russia's  military 
security  required  a  line  of  defense  outside  Russia's  own  borders 
and  along  the  borders  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (and  even, 
according  to  some,  including  a  "neutral"  Central  Europe)  (see 
The  Geopolitical  Context,  ch.  9) .  A  related  position  called  for 
Russia  to  counter  efforts  by  countries  such  as  Turkey  and  Iran 
to  gain  influence  in  the  new  states. 

Some  Western  observers  suggested  that  the  characteristic 
positions  of  Russian  conservatives  and  liberals  regarding  the 
near  abroad  differed  only  in  the  degree  of  hegemony  they 
demanded  that  Russia  have  over  the  CIS  states.  These  observ- 
ers also  saw  Russia  engaging  in  a  two-sided  foreign  policy  that 
distinguished  policy  toward  the  near  abroad  from  policy 
toward  the  rest  of  the  world  (see  The  Near  Abroad,  this  ch.). 

The  1993  concept  and  a  new  military  doctrine  were  to  be 
parts  of  an  all-inclusive  Russian  national  security  concept.  In 
April  1996,  the  Yeltsin  government  announced  a  draft  national 
security  concept.  That  document  included  the  seemingly  pro- 
gressive renunciation  of  strategic  and  military  parity  with  the 
United  States,  reaffirmation  of  collective  security  within  the 
CIS,  and  support  for  reductions  in  nuclear  arsenals  and  domes- 
tic military  reforms.  Ratification  of  the  new  concept  was  subject 
to  the  political  events  of  mid-1996,  including  the  presidential 
election. 

The  State  of  the  Federation  Speeches 

In  February  1994,  Yeltsin  outlined  Russia's  foreign  policy  in 
his  first  state  of  the  federation  address  to  the  Russian  parlia- 
ment, as  the  1993  constitution  required.  Yeltsin's  address  to  the 


436 


Foreign  Relations 


more  nationalistic  legislative  body  that  had  just  been  elected 
called  for  a  more  assertive  Russian  foreign  policy.  However, 
Yeltsin  showed  the  still  inchoate  and  even  contradictory  char- 
acter of  Russian  foreign  policy  by  making  several  references  to 
conciliatory,  Western-oriented  policies. 

Yeltsin  noted  that  as  a  great  country,  Russia  had  its  own  for- 
eign policy  priorities  to  pursue,  including  prevention  of  cold  or 
hot  global  war  by  preventing  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of 
mass  destruction.  By  mentioning  the  possibility  of  global  war, 
he  supported  the  view  of  the  Russian  military  and  other  conser- 
vative and  hard-line  groups  that  the  United  States  and  the  West 
remain  a  threat.  Yeltsin  voiced  support  for  the  Partnership  for 
Peace  (PfP — see  Glossary)  program  of  the  North  Atlantic 
Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary)  and  opposition  to 
the  expansion  of  NATO  to  include  Central  European  states 
without  including  Russia  (see  Western  Europe,  this  ch.).  On 
international  economic  matters,  Yeltsin  called  for  quick 
removal  of  obstacles  to  trade  with  the  West  and  for  making  the 
CIS  into  an  economic  union  with  a  common  market  as  well  as  a 
common  security  system  and  guarantees  on  human  rights.  As  a 
warning  to  those  calling  for  reconstituting  the  empire,  he 
stated  that  such  integration  should  not  damage  Russia  by 
depleting  the  nation's  material  and  financial  resources. 

Yeltsin's  February  1995  state  of  the  federation  address  did 
not  repeat  the  contradictory  and  sometimes  harsh  tone  of  the 
1994  speech.  Yeltsin  broadly  depicted  a  cooperative  and  concil- 
iatory Russian  foreign  policy,  but  he  offered  few  details  on  pol- 
icy toward  specific  countries  or  regions.  Yeltsin  outlined 
Russia's  cooperation  with  the  Group  of  Seven  (G-7;  see  Glos- 
sary) of  top  world  economic  powers,  the  Organization  for 
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE — see  Glossary), 
the  UN,  and  NATO;  the  need  for  Russia  to  adhere  to  arms  con- 
trol agreements;  and  reductions  in  Russian  armed  forces. 
Despite  his  broadly  conciliatory  attitude  toward  the  West  and 
his  general  support  of  world  cooperation,  Yeltsin  still  objected 
to  NATO  enlargement  as  a  threat  to  European  security. 

Some  political  analysts  in  the  West  suggested  that  the  1995 
speech  was  an  attempt  to  reassure  the  world  of  Russia's  peace- 
ful foreign  policy  in  the  wake  of  its  widely  censured  attempt  to 
suppress  separatism  in  the  Republic  of  Chechnya  in  December 
1994  (see  Movements  Toward  Sovereignty,  ch.  4).  Later  in 
1995,  arguing  that  the  West  was  wrong  to  fear  Moscow's  inten- 
tions toward  Central  Europe,  Yeltsin  announced  that  in  1995 


437 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russian  foreign  policy  would  be  nonconfrontational  and  would 
follow  the  principle  of  "real  partnership  in  all  directions"  with 
the  United  States,  Europe,  China,  India,  Japan,  and  Latin 
America.  The  priorities  of  this  stance  would  be  enhanced  inter- 
action with  the  CIS  states  and  partnership  with  the  United 
States  on  the  basis  of  a  "balance  of  interests." 

The  February  1996  state  of  the  federation  speech  occurred 
just  after  the  convocation  of  the  Federal  Assembly  (parliament) 
following  the  December  legislative  elections  and  a  few  months 
before  the  June  1996  presidential  election.  The  legislative  elec- 
tions brought  substantial  gains  for  the  Communist  Party  of  the 
Russian  Federation  (Kommunisticheskaya  partiya  Rossiyskoy 
Federatsii — KPRF)  and  losses  for  reformists,  which  indicated 
deep  discontent  with  the  Yeltsin  administration.  Under  these 
conditions,  Yeltsin  gave  foreign  policy  only  brief  mention  in  his 
February  speech.  He  noted  that  there  had  been  problems  in 
defining  Russia's  foreign  policy  priorities  and  in  matching  pol- 
icy to  execution.  He  vaguely  promised  a  more  realistic  and 
pragmatic  policy  that  would  support  Russia's  national  interests. 
Yeltsin  singled  out  NATO  enlargement,  efforts  against  Russian 
interests  in  the  CIS,  conflict  in  the  former  Yugoslavia,  and  con- 
troversies over  the  Conventional  Forces  in  Europe  Treaty  (CFE 
Treaty — see  Glossary)  and  the  Anti-Ballistic  MissileTreaty 
(ABM  Treaty — see  Glossary)  as  persisting  problems  of  Russia's 
foreign  policy. 

Despite  these  problems,  Yeltsin  emphasized  that  his  foreign 
policy  had  scored  several  major  achievements,  including  moves 
toward  further  integration  of  the  CIS.  Repeating  statements 
from  the  1995  speech,  he  noted  that  Russia's  strategic  arms 
control  and  security  agreements  ensured  that  the  country 
faced  no  real  military  or  nuclear  threat.  He  argued  that  such 
security  gains  made  Russia's  signing  of  the  second  Strategic 
Arms  Reduction  Treaty  (START  II — see  Glossary)  advisable. 
He  praised  United  States  and  Russian  cooperation  in  extend- 
ing the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Treaty  (NPT — see  Glossary), 
and  he  noted  the  international  prestige  that  Russia  had  gained 
through  participation  in  meetings  of  the  G-7,  membership  in 
the  Council  of  Europe  (see  Glossary),  and  new  ties  with  China 
and  the  states  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations 
(ASEAN)  and  the  Persian  Gulf. 

The  Foreign  Policy  Mechanism 

In  the  Soviet  system,  the  predominant  foreign  policy  actor 


438 


Foreign  Relations 


was  the  general  secretary  of  the  CPSU,  who  also  was  the  preem- 
inent figure  in  the  party's  Politburo  (the  highest  executive 
body  of  the  government).  By  virtue  of  this  position,  the  general 
secretary  also  was  the  country's  recognized  foreign  representa- 
tive. Other  Politburo  members  with  major  foreign  policy 
responsibility  were  the  ministers  of  foreign  affairs  and  defense 
(always  members  of  the  Politburo),  the  chairman  of  the  Com- 
mittee for  State  Security  (Komitet  gosudarstvennoy  bezopas- 
nosti — KGB;  see  Glossary),  and  the  chief  of  the  CPSU's 
International  Department.  The  minister  of  foreign  economic 
relations  had  foreign  policy  responsibility  in  commercial  rela- 
tions, and  other  members  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  provided 
input  when  their  specific  areas  involved  foreign  affairs. 

In  1988  constitutional  revisions  gave  the  Supreme  Soviet,  the 
Soviet  Union's  national  parliament,  new  powers  to  oversee  for- 
eign policy  and  some  input  in  policy  formulation.  The  central- 
ization of  foreign  policy  decision  making  in  the  Politburo, 
together  with  the  long  tenure  of  its  members,  contributed  to 
the  Soviet  Union's  ability  to  plan  and  guide  foreign  policy  over 
long  periods  with  a  constancy  lacking  in  pluralistic  political  sys- 
tems. 

When  a  large  part  of  the  Soviet  Union's  foreign  policy  func- 
tions devolved  to  Russia  in  1992,  the  Soviet  pattern  of  centraliz- 
ing foreign  policy  continued.  The  Russian  constitution  of  1993 
gives  the  executive  branch  the  chief  role  in  making  foreign  pol- 
icy, with  the  legislative  branch  occupying  a  distinctly  subsidiary 
role.  In  the  years  since  1993,  President  Yeltsin  has  formed  vari- 
ous organizations  in  the  executive  branch  to  assist  him  in  for- 
mulating foreign  policy.  The  mechanism  of  policy  making  has 
remained  unwieldy,  however,  and  the  increasingly  nationalistic 
parliament  has  used  every  power  it  commands  to  influence  pol- 
icy making. 

The  President 

Under  the  provisions  of  the  1993  constitution,  the  president 
exercises  leadership  in  forming  foreign  policy,  represents  Rus- 
sia in  international  relations,  conducts  talks  and  signs  interna- 
tional treaties,  forms  and  heads  the  Security  Council,  approves 
military  doctrine,  delivers  annual  messages  to  the  parliament 
on  foreign  policy,  appoints  and  recalls  diplomatic  representa- 
tives (after  consultation  with  committees  or  commissions  of  the 
parliament),  and  accepts  credentials  and  letters  of  recall  from 
foreign  diplomats. 


439 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Between  1992  and  1996,  there  were  indications  that  Yeltsin 
made  important  foreign  policy  decisions  with  little  or  no  con- 
sultation with  other  officials  of  his  administration  or  with  the 
legislative  branch.  In  that  period,  the  size  of  the  presidential 
apparatus  steadily  increased  until  it  reportedly  numbered  sev- 
eral thousand  staffers,  including  a  Security  Council  staff  of 
hundreds  (see  The  Executive  Branch,  ch.  7).  At  the  end  of 
1993,  Yeltsin  appointed  a  national  security  adviser  who  estab- 
lished his  own  staff,  and  during  1995  the  Presidential  Security 
Service,  under  the  direction  of  Aleksandr  Korzhakov,  appar- 
ently also  assumed  some  responsibility  for  foreign  policy  analy- 
sis. According  to  some  observers,  the  vast  size  of  the 
presidential  apparatus  exacerbated  the  confused  and  unwieldy 
formulation  and  implementation  of  foreign  policy.  In  the  early 
1990s,  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  came  directly  under  pres- 
idential control,  which  further  enhanced  presidential  power. 

The  Security  Council 

The  function  of  the  Russian  Security  Council  is  somewhat 
similar  to  that  of  the  Defense  Council  that  Nikita  S.  Khru- 
shchev (in  office  1953-64)  created.  Khrushchev's  successor, 
Leonid  I.  Brezhnev  (in  office  1964-82),  had  retained  the 
Defense  Council  as  a  consultative  body  on  foreign  policy  and 
defense  security,  and  this  role  was  codified  in  the  1977  Soviet 
constitution.  Gorbachev  replaced  the  Defense  Council  in  1990, 
first  by  the  Presidential  Council  and  then  by  the  Security  Coun- 
cil. 

After  its  statutory  establishment  in  mid-1992,  the  Russian 
Security  Council  became  part  of  Yeltsin's  presidential  appara- 
tus. To  distinguish  his  Security  Council  from  earlier  councils, 
Yeltsin  presented  the  new  body  as  an  open  organization  that 
would  obey  the  constitution  and  other  laws  and  would  work 
closely  with  executive  and  legislative  bodies.  He  said  the  new 
council  was  based  partly  on  that  of  the  United  States  National 
Security  Council.  By  statute,  the  Security  Council  is  a  consulta- 
tive rather  than  decision-making  body.  It  has  the  authority  to 
prepare  decisions  for  the  president  on  military  policy,  protec- 
tion of  civil  rights,  internal  and  external  security,  and  foreign 
policy  issues,  and  it  has  the  power  to  conduct  basic  research, 
long-range  planning,  and  coordination  of  other  executive- 
branch  efforts  in  the  foreign  policy  realm. 

The  Security  Council's  founding  statute  stipulates  that  vot- 
ing members  include  the  president,  the  vice  president,  the 


440 


Foreign  Relations 


prime  minister,  the  first  deputy  chairman  of  the  Supreme 
Soviet,  and  the  secretary  of  the  council.  It  also  includes  nonvot- 
ing members  from  the  Government  (Russia's  cabinet),  includ- 
ing the  ministers  or  chiefs  of  defense,  internal  affairs,  foreign 
affairs,  security,  foreign  intelligence,  justice,  and  others.  Other 
officials  and  foreign  policy  experts,  including  the  chairman  of 
the  Supreme  Soviet,  also  are  invited  to  participate  in  council 
sessions.  By  statute  the  Security  Council  is  to  meet  at  least  once 
a  month.  The  1993  constitution  makes  formation  of  the  coun- 
cil the  prerogative  of  the  president,  who  is  to  be  its  chairman. 
In  February  1994,  Yeltsin  reapportioned  the  membership  of 
the  council,  giving  additional  influence  to  defense,  internal 
affairs,  justice,  civil  defense,  security,  foreign  intelligence,  and 
foreign  affairs  bureaucracies.  Another  adjustment  in  mid-1994 
included  the  heads  of  both  chambers  of  the  new  Federal 
Assembly  and  the  head  of  the  Federal  Border  Service.  In  1995 
Yeltsin  added  the  minister  of  atomic  energy  to  the  council. 
After  the  election  of  a  heavily  antireformist  parliament  in 
December  1995,  Yeltsin  announced  that  the  speakers  of  the 
two  chambers  of  the  Federal  Assembly  would  be  excluded  from 
membership  in  the  Security  Council. 

Some  Russian  commentators  complained  that  the  methods 
of  the  Security  Council  under  its  first  secretary,  Yuriy  Skokov, 
were  authoritarian,  secretive,  and  antireformist.  In  early  1993, 
a  major  rift  occurred  between  the  Security  Council  and  Yeltsin. 
Skokov  led  the  council  in  opposing  Yeltsin's  attempt  to  declare 
a  so-called  special  rule  for  the  executive  branch  as  a  means  of 
circumventing  an  executive-legislative  deadlock  and  forcing 
legislative  elections.  After  Yeltsin  won  this  power  struggle 
against  the  parliament,  he  felt  strong  enough  to  replace 
Skokov  as  secretary  of  the  council.  He  named  Oleg  Lobov  as 
secretary  in  September  1993,  and  Lobov  served  until  Alek- 
sandr  Lebed'  replaced  him  in  June  1996. 

The  Security  Council  reportedly  has  played  an  important 
role  in  several  vital  foreign  policy  decisions.  In  September 
1992,  after  an  outcry  from  the  Security  Council  over  possible 
concessions  to  Japan  on  the  issue  of  possession  of  the  Kuril 
Islands,  Yeltsin  canceled  a  planned  visit  to  Japan  (see  Japan, 
this  ch.).  In  1993  the  Security  Council's  Interdepartmental  For- 
eign Policy  Commission  (IFPC)  reworked  Foreign  Minister 
Kozyrev's  foreign  policy  concept  to  make  it  more  conservative. 
The  IFPC  also  appeared  to  be  influential  in  Russian  troop  with- 
drawal policy  in  the  Baltic  states,  which  concluded  in  mid-1994. 


441 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  Security  Council's  agenda  also  reportedly  included  delib- 
erations on  United  States-Russian  relations,  nuclear  arms 
reduction,  ethnic  relations  within  Russia,  crime  fighting,  and 
relations  with  the  former  Soviet  republics.  On  many  issues, 
however,  the  council  apparently  failed  to  conciliate  opposing 
positions  of  the  ministries  of  defense  and  foreign  affairs,  and 
the  council's  overall  influence  appeared  to  wane  after  Skokov's 
dismissal.  In  December  1994,  the  council  rubber-stamped 
Yeltsin's  decision  to  send  Russian  security  forces  into  Chech- 
nya, and  it  invariably  approved  his  policies  there  during  1995 
and  early  1996.  Major  questions  remained  about  the  quality  of 
debate  in  the  council  because  military  and  police  authorities 
may  not  have  furnished  Yeltsin  with  complete  information  on 
operations  in  Chechnya  during  this  period.  The  council  likely 
had  become  moribund  as  a  consultative  body  before  Lebed' 
attempted  to  revitalize  its  role  in  1996. 

The  Security  Council  contains  various  subdepartments  and 
committees.  Most  significant  to  foreign  policy  formation  is  the 
IFPC,  which  was  created  in  December  1992.  The  IFPC  analyzes 
and  forecasts  information  on  foreign  policy  for  the  president. 
Creation  of  the  IFPC  coincided  with  increased  opposition  to 
Kozyrev's  conduct  of  foreign  policy  and  to  Yeltsin's  pro-Western 
policies.  In  1993  the  IFPC  attempted  to  block  Kozyrev's  pro- 
Western  foreign  policies  and  urged  a  more  "imperial"  foreign 
policy  toward  the  near  abroad.  After  1993,  however,  the  IFPC 
appeared  more  amenable  to  the  foreign  ministry's  policies. 

The  Parliament 

During  the  first  two  years  of  Russia's  independence,  the  Rus- 
sian parliament's  foreign  policy  powers  were  a  matter  of  con- 
tention with  the  executive  branch.  This  discord  was  part  of  a 
broader  legislative-executive  branch  standoff  that  culminated 
in  Yeltsin's  forced  takeover  of  the  legislative  building — the  so- 
called  White  House — in  early  October  1993  and  his  rule  by 
decree  until  December.  In  1992-93  the  parliament  still  derived 
its  power  from  the  1978  constitution  of  the  Russian  Republic 
and  numerous  amendments  to  that  document.  Its  foreign  pol- 
icy prerogatives  included  the  right  to  ratify  or  abrogate  interna- 
tional treaties,  to  confirm  or  recall  diplomats  serving  abroad, 
to  approve  or  reject  the  deployment  of  armed  forces  to  areas  of 
conflict  abroad,  and  to  approve  the  general  direction  of  for- 
eign policy.

Foreign  Relations 


In  this  period,  the  parliament  increasingly  attempted  to 
widen  its  foreign  policy  prerogatives  in  opposition  to  official 
policies.  These  efforts  included  attempts  to  influence  Russia's 
votes  in  the  UN  Security  Council  on  economic  and  military 
sanctions  against  the  former  Yugoslavia,  an  open  letter  decry- 
ing Yeltsin's  planned  September  1992  visit  to  Japan,  ajuly  1993 
resolution  declaring  the  Crimean  city  of  Sevastopol'  a  Russian 
port  although  it  is  located  in  Ukrainian  territory,  and  denunci- 
ation of  United  States  aerial  bombing  of  Iraq  in  1993.  Kozyrev 
tried  to  work  with  the  International  Affairs  Committee  of  the 
Supreme  Soviet  and  its  successor,  the  State  Duma,  on  several  of 
those  issues,  but  legislative  criticism  became  increasingly  stri- 
dent in  the  period  before  Yeltsin  forcibly  dissolved  the  parlia- 
ment in  September  1993. 

The  1993  constitution  substantially  reduced  the  parliament's 
foreign  policy  powers.  The  State  Duma  retained  broad  respon- 
sibility for  adopting  laws  on  foreign  policy,  but  the  constitution 
stipulated  no  specific  foreign  policy  duties  for  the  legislative 
branch.  The  constitution  gave  the  Federation  Council,  the 
upper  house  of  parliament,  the  responsibility  for  deciding  on 
the  use  of  troops  abroad  and  reviewing  State  Duma  ratification 
and  denunciation  of  international  treaties  and  Duma  decisions 
on  war  and  peace.  In  January  1994,  the  newly  elected  parlia- 
ment established  committees  dealing  with  foreign  policy  issues, 
including  a  Committee  on  Geopolitics  with  a  member  of  hard- 
liner Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's  Liberal-Democratic  Party  of  Rus- 
sia as  chairman.  Vladimir  Lukin  returned  from  his  post  as 
ambassador  to  the  United  States  to  head  the  Duma's  Interna- 
tional Affairs  Committee,  which  worked  in  1994  with  Kozyrev 
and  Yeltsin  to  forge  a  more  conservative  consensus  on  foreign 
policy  issues. 

After  remaining  relatively  quiescent  on  foreign  policy  mat- 
ters in  1994,  the  parliament  stepped  up  its  criticism  of  Govern- 
ment policy  in  1995.  Four  State  Duma  committees  investigated 
Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  policies  toward  the  near  abroad, 
Asia,  and  the  West,  timing  their  queries  to  enhance  electoral 
prospects  for  anti-Yeltsin  deputies  in  the  December  legislative 
elections.  In  September  1995,  the  State  Duma  called  for  Russia 
to  unilaterally  lift  UN-approved  economic  sanctions  against 
Serbia;  then  it  demanded  that  Yeltsin  condemn  NATO  air 
strikes  against  Bosnian  Serb  targets  and  convened  a  special  ses- 
sion to  debate  Russian  policy  toward  the  former  Yugoslavia.  In 
that  session,  ultranationalist  and  communist  deputies  called  for 


443 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Kozyrev's  resignation  and  for  a  wholesale  redirection  of  foreign 
policy. 

After  the  legislative  elections  of  1995,  more  deputies  called 
for  the  parliament  to  take  a  more  active  role  in  foreign  policy 
oversight.  The  reformist  Yabloko  coalition  managed  to  gain  the 
chairmanship  of  the  International  Affairs  Committee  in  the 
State  Duma,  somewhat  mitigating  the  anti-Government  and 
anti-Western  tone  of  legislative  proceedings.  However,  many  of 
the  State  Duma's  nonbinding  resolutions  complicated  foreign 
policy  by  arousing  protests  from  foreign  governments.  In 
March  1996,  the  State  Duma  passed  nonbinding  resolutions 
abrogating  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  which  brought 
condemnation  from  most  CIS  member  states  as  a  threat  to 
their  sovereignty  and  independence.  In  1996  the  Duma  also 
passed  a  resolution  calling  for  elimination  of  international  eco- 
nomic sanctions  against  Libya. 

The  Government  (Cabinet) 

According  to  the  1993  constitution,  the  chairman  of  the 
Government,  the  prime  minister,  defines  basic  policy  guide- 
lines, and  the  Government  enacts  the  nation's  foreign  policy 
according  to  those  guidelines.  After  referendum  approval  of 
the  1993  constitution,  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Chernomyrdin, 
whom  Yeltsin  had  appointed  in  December  1992,  began  to  play 
a  more  prominent  role  in  meeting  with  foreign  officials,  partic- 
ularly CIS  leaders.  The  prime  minister  focused  primarily  on 
economic  and  governmental  relations,  however,  and  made  few 
foreign  policy  pronouncements. 

The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs 

The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  was  a  central  battleground  of 
foreign  policy  formation  from  October  1990  until  January 
1996,  when  An  drey  Kozyrev  led  it.  In  the  two  years  before  the 
dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Russia's  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs  under  Kozyrev  had  played  an  important  role  in  chal- 
lenging the  supremacy  of  Soviet  foreign  policy.  At  the  end  of 
1991,  Kozyrev's  ministry  formally  absorbed  the  functions  and 
many  of  the  personnel  of  the  defunct  Soviet  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Affairs.  At  that  point,  budgetary  constraints  forced  the  clo- 
sure of  three  dozen  former  Soviet  embassies  and  consulates 
and  the  release  of  more  than  2,000  personnel. 

After  some  uncertainty  about  the  role  of  the  ministry,  Yeltsin 
decreed  in  1992  that  it  should  ensure  a  unified  policy  line  in 


444 


Foreign  Relations 


Russian  relations  with  foreign  states  and  coordinate  the  foreign 
policy  activities  of  other  government  agencies.  At  the  end  of 
1992,  increasing  criticism  of  policy  led  Yeltsin  to  subordinate 
the  role  of  the  ministry  to  the  supervision  of  the  IFPG. 

Beginning  in  1992,  Kozyrev  and  his  ministry  became  the  tar- 
gets of  increasingly  forceful  attacks  from  Russia's  nationalist 
factions,  who  found  any  hint  of  pro-Western  policy  a  pretext  to 
call  for  Kozyrev's  ouster.  On  several  occasions,  Yeltsin  also  criti- 
cized his  foreign  minister  in  public.  Remarkably,  Kozyrev 
retained  his  position  until  January  1996,  when  Yeltsin  replaced 
him  during  a  wave  of  nationalist  appointments. 

In  December  1992,  Kozyrev  delivered  what  came  to  be  called 
his  shock  diplomacy  speech  at  a  meeting  of  the  Conference  on 
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE — see  Glossary).  In 
the  speech,  he  outlined  what  he  termed  corrections  to  Russian 
foreign  policy  in  a  list  of  priorities  that  ultranationalists  advo- 
cated. The  corrections  included  a  shift  in  policy  away  from  the 
West  and  toward  Asia;  admonitions  against  NATO  involvement 
in  the  Baltic  states  or  other  areas  of  the  near  abroad;  a  call  for 
lifting  UN  economic  sanctions  against  Serbia;  and  a  demand 
that  the  near  abroad  rejoin  Russia  in  a  new  federation  or  con- 
federation. Western  foreign  ministries  expressed  shock,  and 
Kozyrev  retracted  the  speech  by  describing  it  as  a  rhetorical 
warning  of  what  might  happen  if  ultranationalists  came  to  dic- 
tate Russian  foreign  policy.  Although  some  Russian  and  West- 
ern observers  said  the  speech  was  irresponsible,  others  saw  it  as 
an  attempt  to  discredit  ultranationalist  views  (and  prevent  the 
creation  of  the  IFPC,  then  under  consideration)  by  dramatiz- 
ing the  potential  impact  of  extremist  views. 

In  March  1995,  Yeltsin  criticized  Kozyrev  for  his  actions  on 
several  policy  fronts  and  assumed  control  of  the  Ministry  of 
Foreign  Affairs  with  the  authority  to  appoint  all  deputy  foreign 
ministers.  At  the  same  time,  Yeltsin  enhanced  the  ministry's 
powers  by  making  it  responsible  for  coordinating  and  control- 
ling all  governmental  foreign  policy  actions.  Perhaps  to  head 
off  mounting  electoral  criticism  of  foreign  policy  during  1995, 
as  well  as  to  enhance  coordination  efforts,  Yeltsin  also  estab- 
lished a  governmental  commission  on  foreign  policy.  Ostensi- 
bly, the  commission  was  to  evaluate  the  ministry's  conduct  of 
foreign  policy  and  to  determine  policy  coordination  needs 
between  the  presidential  apparatus  and  government  agencies 
having  foreign  policy  responsibilities.  Then,  after  intensified 
NATO  bombardment  of  Bosnian  Serb  military  targets  in  Sep- 


445 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

tember  1995,  Yeltsin  reiterated  his  dissatisfaction  with  the  min- 
istry and  the  need  for  personnel  and  policy  changes. 

In  December  1995,  Yeltsin  created  yet  another  advisory 
group,  the  Council  on  Foreign  Policy,  to  present  him  with  pro- 
posals for  coordinating  the  foreign  policy  activities  of  various 
government  bodies  and  to  inform  him  of  their  activities.  Mem- 
bers of  the  council  were  to  be  the  ministers  of  foreign  affairs, 
defense,  foreign  trade,  and  finance;  the  heads  of  the  foreign 
intelligence,  security,  and  border  guard  services;  and  Yeltsin's 
foreign  policy  adviser.  Scheduled  to  meet  monthly,  the  council 
had  projected  functions  virtually  indistinguishable  from  those 
of  the  Security  Council. 

In  January  1996,  Yeltsin  announced  Kozyrev's  resignation, 
which  had  long  been  expected  in  view  of  the  harsh  criticism  of 
Russian  foreign  policy.  Western  analysts  explained  that  the 
powerful  reactionary  forces  in  the  State  Duma  had  been  poised 
to  name  their  own  candidate  to  head  the  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs,  so  Yeltsin  forestalled  their  move  by  dismissing  Kozyrev 
and  naming  the  more  moderate  Yevgeniy  Primakov,  an  Arabist 
who  had  been  KGB  chief  of  espionage  in  1991.  Analysts  viewed 
Primakov  as  a  pragmatist  with  no  strong  views  toward  the  West 
and  predicted  he  would  serve  only  until  the  winner  of  the 
upcoming  presidential  election  replaced  him.  They  expected 
Primakov  to  follow  Yeltsin's  lead  in  foreign  policy  by  making  no 
new  gestures  of  friendship  toward  the  West  during  the  presi- 
dential election  year.  Although  Primakov  began  his  tenure  by 
reassuring  the  United  States  that  Russia  would  remain  true  to 
its  international  commitments,  he  also  declared  that  Russia  was 
and  remains  a  great  power  and  that  his  primary  goal  was  to 
reintegrate  the  former  Soviet  republics,  especially  the  Baltic 
states  and  Ukraine.  These  statements  blunted  the  nationalist 
factions'  complaints  that  Yeltsin  was  a  puppet  of  Western  inter- 
ests. 

The  Ministry  of  Defense 

In  the  Soviet  era,  the  Ministry  of  Defense  and  its  General 
Staff  officers  played  a  central  role  in  the  formation  of  national 
security  policy  because  of  their  monopoly  of  defense  informa- 
tion. After  1991  many  senior  officers  in  the  armed  forces  con- 
tinued to  view  military  coercion  as  the  main  instrument  for 
preventing  the  other  side  from  gaining  in  foreign  policy  dis- 
putes (see  Military  Doctrine,  ch.  9).  In  the  early  1990s,  most  of 
the  military  establishment  appeared  to  back  both  an  assertive 


446 


Foreign  Relations 


stance  in  the  near  abroad,  where  the  Soviet  military  had  exer- 
cised substantial  influence  through  its  military  districts  and 
played  a  role  in  local  politics,  and  a  less  conciliatory  relation- 
ship with  the  West.  Some  reformist  elements  of  the  military, 
mainly  junior  officers,  rejected  these  views,  and  local  military 
leaders  sometimes  seemed  to  act  independently  of  their  minis- 
try in  such  areas  of  the  near  abroad  as  Moldova  and  Abkhazia, 
Georgia's  breakaway  autonomous  republic.  More  often,  the 
military  leadership  was  united  on  actions  having  foreign  policy 
repercussions,  such  as  their  advocacy  of  violating  CFE  Treaty 
limitations  on  military  equipment  deployed  in  the  Caucasus 
region. 

Regional  Policies 

The  geographical  extent  of  Russia's  foreign  policy  interests  is 
considerably  less  than  that  of  the  Soviet  Union,  which  sought 
support  and  bases  of  operation  wherever  they  might  be  avail- 
able in  the  world.  Nevertheless,  most  of  the  Soviet  Union's  pri- 
mary zones  of  interest- — Central  and  Western  Europe,  the  Far 
East,  the  Mediterranean  and  Black  Sea  regions,  and  the  United 
States — are  priorities  for  Russia  in  the  1990s.  To  that  list  has 
been  added  the  near  abroad,  which  has  become  a  zone  of  inse- 
curity and  the  subject  of  constant  debate. 

The  Near  Abroad 

Many  Russians  use  the  term  "near  abroad"  (blizhneye 
zarubezhiye)  to  refer  to  the  fourteen  other  former  Soviet  repub- 
lics that  had  declared  their  independence  by  the  time  the 
Soviet  Union  broke  up  at  the  end  of  1991.  Leaders  and  elites  in 
those  republics  objected  that  the  term  implied  limitations  on 
the  sovereignty  or  status  of  the  new  states.  Since  independence, 
Russian  policy  makers  have  tried  both  to  restore  old  bilateral 
connections  and  to  create  new  relationships  wherever  possible. 
Throughout  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  inconsistency  and 
reverses  characterized  these  diplomatic  efforts  because  no  firm 
principles  underlay  them.  However,  Russia  maintained  strong 
influence  with  all  but  the  Baltic  states,  so  the  nationalists'  hope 
of  reclaiming  part  of  the  lost  empire  stayed  alive. 

Particularly  perplexing  for  Western  observers  were  apparent 
contradictions  between  Yeltsin  government  policies  and  the 
Russian  military  forces'  actions  in  certain  of  the  newly  indepen- 
dent states  (NIS)  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  An  example  was 


447 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russian  military  support  of  Abkhazian  rebels  against  the  Geor- 
gian government  in  1993  at  the  same  time  that  the  Yeltsin  gov- 
ernment was  promoting  a  cease-fire  in  the  region.  Some 
Western  observers  explained  those  contradictions  as  partly  a 
result  of  differing  bureaucratic  interests  and  turfs,  with  the  mil- 
itary seeking  to  continue  its  traditional  influence  and  presence 
in  the  near  abroad  against  the  meddling  of  the  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Affairs.  If  Russia's  overall  policy  goal  were  to  emasculate 
Georgia  and  force  it  farther  into  the  Russian  sphere  of  influ- 
ence, ran  the  argument,  then  military  and  diplomatic  actions 
would  have  been  more  compatible. 

However,  beginning  in  1993  a  greater  degree  of  concor- 
dance appeared  between  the  actions  of  the  military  and  the 
government.  Yeltsin  and  Kozyrev  stressed  that  Russia  ensured 
regional  stability  and  acted  in  accordance  with  international 
standards  in  offering  Russian  diplomatic  and  military  "peace- 
keeping" services  to  help  end  conflicts  in  the  NIS.  They  also 
emphasized,  however,  that  Russia  had  vital  interests  in  using 
diplomatic  or  military  means  to  protect  the  rights  of  the  more 
than  25  million  ethnic  Russians  residing  in  the  near  abroad. 
Accordingly,  Russia  pressured  the  NIS  to  enact  legal  protec- 
tions such  as  dual  citizenship  for  ethnic  Russians.  At  the  same 
time,  Russia  provided  some  aid  to  ease  the  internal  economic 
distress  that  stimulated  the  emigration  of  ethnic  Russians  from 
the  new  states. 

The  new  states  signed  friendship  treaties  and  other  agree- 
ments with  Russia  pledging  them  to  protect  ethnic  Russian  res- 
idents from  harm  and  to  respect  their  human  and  cultural 
rights.  Because  the  borders  among  the  states  were  open 
(except  for  Russia's  borders  with  the  Transcaucasus  states, 
which  were  wholly  or  partly  closed  in  1994-96  during  the 
Chechnya  conflict),  Russia's  leaders  asserted  that  Russia  had 
important  interests  in  ensuring  the  security  of  NIS  borders  with 
other  states,  such  as  Tajikistan's  border  with  Afghanistan.  In 
some  cases,  Russian  troops  served  as  so-called  peacekeepers  in 
conflict  areas  at  the  request  of  host  governments  such  as  Tajiki- 
stan and  Georgia.  In  April  1994,  at  the  request  of  the  Ministry 
of  Defense,  Yeltsin  decreed  that  Russia  would  seek  military 
bases  throughout  most  of  the  NIS. 

Some  analysts  in  the  NIS  and  the  West  warned  that  Russia 
was  showing  a  desire  either  to  reconstitute  its  traditional 
empire  or  at  least  to  include  the  NIS  within  an  exclusive  sphere 
of  influence.  They  speculated  that  its  arrangement  with  the 


448 


Foreign  Relations 


near  abroad  might  take  the  form  of  a  collective  security  pact, 
similar  to  the  former  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary),  that  would 
counter  NATO.  Western  analysts  concluded  that  Russia's  politi- 
cal and  military  elites  adopted  a  more  assertive  foreign  policy 
after  the  election  of  large  numbers  of  ultranationalists  and 
communists  to  the  parliament  in  December  1993.  They 
observed  this  trend  toward  assertiveness  again  during  cam- 
paigns for  the  legislative  elections  of  December  1995  and  in 
the  rhetoric  of  the  1996  presidential  election  campaign. 

However,  the  Yeltsin  government  took  considerable  diplo- 
matic actions  to  end  NIS  conflicts,  and  it  stated  that  the  finan- 
cial burdens  and  human  loss  involved  in  burgeoning  regional 
peacekeeping  efforts  precluded  continuing  such  operations. 
Opinion  polls  showed  that  although  some  Russians  supported 
a  greater  role  in  the  near  abroad,  particularly  in  safeguarding 
ethnic  Russians,  the  majority  did  not  want  Russia  to  assume 
new  economic  and  defense  burdens,  particularly  in  Central 
Asia.  Even  in  the  State  Duma,  many  members  expressed  doubt 
about  the  wisdom  of  even  the  peacekeeping  efforts  already 
under  way  in  Tajikistan  and  Georgia. 

Russian  peacekeeping  efforts  in  the  NIS  began  with  ad  hoc 
agreements.  For  example,  in  August  1993  Russia  formally 
invoked  a  Collective  Security  Agreement,  signed  by  members 
of  the  CIS  and  ratified  by  the  Russian  parliament,  to  justify 
those  efforts  in  Tajikistan.  Avowing  in  the  UN  and  the  CSCE 
that  its  diplomatic  and  military  efforts  in  the  NIS  supported 
regional  stability,  Russia  requested  international  approval  and 
financial  support  for  its  efforts.  Kozyrev  called  for  the  deploy- 
ment of  UN  and  CSCE  observers  and  the  involvement  of  the 
international  diplomatic  community  in  solving  the  conflict  in 
Georgia.  In  March  1994,  Kozyrev  asked  the  UN  to  recognize 
the  CIS  as  an  observer  international  organization  and  asked 
the  European  Union  (EU — see  Glossary)  and  the  CSCE  to  rec- 
ognize the  CIS  as  a  regional  organization.  Acknowledgment 
from  these  organizations  would  implicitly  endorse  the  regional 
peacekeeping  actions  of  the  CIS. 

At  the  December  1993  CIS  meeting  of  heads  of  state,  held 
after  the  Russian  elections,  Yeltsin's  calls  for  strengthening  mil- 
itary and  economic  cooperation  within  the  CIS  met  with 
greater  approval  than  they  had  previously.  Since  then  the  CIS 
states  have  been  far  from  unanimous  in  supporting  closer  CIS 
integration,  however:  Armenia,  Tajikistan,  and  Belarus  have 
been  most  amenable;  Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  Kazakstan,  Kyr- 


449 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

gyzstan,  and  Uzbekistan  have  maneuvered  to  maintain  inde- 
pendence while  seeking  support  in  some  areas;  and  Ukraine, 
Moldova,  and  Turkmenistan  have  been  most  opposed  (see  The 
Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  ch.  9) . 

In  September  1995,  Yeltsin  again  maneuvered  toward  a  more 
conservative  CIS  policy  by  repeating  the  Russian  nationalists' 
concerns  with  border  security  and  the  treatment  of  ethnic  Rus- 
sians. In  a  program  stressing  regional  integration,  including  a 
"defensive  alliance,"  Yeltsin  stipulated  that  the  CIS  should  con- 
sist of  countries  "friendly  toward  Russia"  and  that  Russia  should 
be  "a  leading  power"  in  the  CIS,  while  reiterating  the  call  for 
UN  and  OSCE  participation  in  CIS  peacekeeping  actions. 
Among  CIS  regional  problems  of  concern  to  Russia  were  rela- 
tions between  China  and  Kazakstan,  the  effect  of  ethnic  sepa- 
ratism in  China's  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  on 
neighboring  nations  of  Central  Asia,  ethnic  problems  in  Rus- 
sian regions  bordering  Transcaucasia  and  Mongolia,  and  emi- 
gration of  ethnic  Russians  from  Central  Asia. 

Moldova 

In  the  Moldavian  Soviet  Socialist  Republic,  ethnic  minority 
Russians  had  proclaimed  the  autonomous  Dnestr  Moldavian 
Republic,  or  Transnistria,  in  September  1990.  By  late  1992, 
forces  of  the  Russian  14th  Army  had  enabled  these  Russians  to 
consolidate  control  over  most  of  the  Dnestr  region.  Russia's 
actions  chilled  its  relations  with  the  now-independent  Moldova, 
whose  legislature  had  not  ratified  the  1991  CIS  agreement.  The 
pressure  of  a  Russian  trade  blockade  contributed  to  the  victory 
of  anticommunist  candidates  in  Moldova's  February  1994  legis- 
lative elections.  In  April  1994,  the  new  legislature  ratified  Mol- 
dova's membership  in  the  CIS,  bringing  the  last  of  the  non- 
Baltic  Soviet  republics  into  the  organization.  In  October  1994, 
Russia  and  Moldova  agreed  on  the  withdrawal  of  the  14th 
Army,  pending  settlement  of  the  political  status  of  Transnistria. 
The  agreement  was  jeopardized  immediately,  however,  when 
Russia  unexpectedly  declared  that  the  State  Duma  had  to  ratify 
the  agreement,  an  outcome  that  had  not  occurred  as  of  mid- 
1996. 

Georgia 

In  Georgia,  Russian  mercenaries,  allegedly  bolstered  by  Rus- 
sian military  support,  fought  alongside  separatist  forces  from 
Georgia's  Abkhazian  Autonomous  Republic,  who  finally 


450 


Foreign  Relations 


defeated  Georgian  forces  in  September  1993.  In  October  Geor- 
gia was  forced  to  end  its  strong  opposition  to  membership  in 
the  CIS  by  becoming  a  full  member  and  signing  a  series  of 
security  cooperation  agreements.  That  step  prompted  Russia  to 
send  military  peacekeepers  to  support  government  forces, 
which  saved  Georgia's  president  Eduard  Shevardnadze  from 
large-scale  insurrection  and  further  fragmentation  of  the  coun- 
try. The  terms  of  the  so-called  rescue  included  a  Georgian-Rus- 
sian friendship  treaty  calling  for  the  establishment  of  Russian 
military  bases  in  Georgia.  In  June  1994,  Abkhazia  and  Georgia 
agreed  to  the  interpositioning  of  Russian  peacekeepers 
between  Abkhazia  and  the  rest  of  Georgia  to  enforce  a  cease- 
fire. In  September  1995,  a  Russian-Georgian  treaty  established 
twenty-year  Russian  leases  of  three  bases.  The  Russian  forces 
continued  to  share  cease-fire  enforcement  in  Georgia's  break- 
away South  Ossetian  Autonomous  Oblast,  where  they  had  been 
since  1992,  because  no  treaty  had  ended  that  conflict.  The  UN 
military  observer  group  deployed  in  Abkhazia  reported  coop- 
erative relations  with  the  Russian  peacekeepers. 

Central  Asia 

In  Tajikistan,  oppositionist  forces  ousted  the  procommunist 
government  in  September  1992.  Strong  circumstantial  evi- 
dence indicates  that  Russian  forces  assisted  in  the  routing  of 
the  Tajikistani  coalition  government  three  months  later.  In 
1993  several  agreements  formalized  Russian  military  assistance. 
That  year  the  new  Tajikistani  government  deployed  about 
24,000  CIS  peacekeeping  troops  from  Russia,  Uzbekistan, 
Kazakstan,  and  Kyrgyzstan  (the  majority  of  them  Russian) 
along  Tajikistani  borders  and  at  strategic  sites.  In  late  1993, 
Tajikistan  agreed  to  Russia's  conditions  on  joining  the  ruble 
zone  (see  Glossary),  including  giving  Russia  control  over  mon- 
etary and  fiscal  policy,  in  return  for  subsidies.  Tajikistan  and 
Russia  signed  a  cease-fire  agreement  in  September  1994,  but 
Tajikistani  settlement  talks,  held  under  UN  supervision  with 
close  Russian  participation,  remained  inconclusive  as  of  mid- 
1996.  A  small  team  of  temporary  UN  military  observers 
deployed  in  Tajikistan  after  the  cease-fire  agreement  reported 
cooperative  relations  with  CIS  troops. 

In  Kazakstan  in  the  mid-1990s,  ethnic  tensions  increased 
between  the  Kazaks  and  the  large  minority  population  of  Slavs 
(Russians,  Ukrainians,  and  Belarusians)  located  primarily  in 
northern  areas  of  Kazakstan.  The  two  groups  represented  an 


451 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

approximately  equal  share  of  the  population,  and  Kazak  presi- 
dent Nursultan  Nazarbayev  did  a  skillful  job  of  balancing  eth- 
nic needs.  He  addressed  many  ethnic  Russians'  concerns  while 
pushing  language  and  other  policies  that  were  in  the  interests 
of  the  Kazak  population.  He  resisted  Russia's  pressure  to  grant 
ethnic  Russians  dual  citizenship;  the  legislature  elected  in  1995 
contained  a  majority  of  ethnic  Kazaks.  In  1993  Kazakstan  and 
Uzbekistan  introduced  their  own  national  currencies  rather 
than  accept  Russia's  onerous  conditions  for  membership  in  the 
ruble  zone.  Kazakstan  also  defied  Russian  pressure  on  its  vital 
fuel  industry  by  seeking  new  pipeline  routes  that  Russia  could 
not  control.  Nevertheless,  for  all  five  Central  Asian  republics, 
cooperation  with  Russia  remains  an  essential  element  of  eco- 
nomic and  military  policy. 

In  1995  Yeltsin  achieved  a  customs  union  with  Belarus  that 
later  included  Kazakstan  and  Kyrgyzstan.  In  March  1996,  a  new 
treaty  among  the  four  countries  strengthened  the  terms  of 
their  economic  integration.  That  treaty  was  part  of  Yeltsin's 
presidential  campaign  effort  to  show  that  he  advocated  gradual 
and  voluntary  integration  among  CIS  members,  in  contrast  to 
the  threatening  gestures  of  the  State  Duma  and  the  Commu- 
nist Party  of  the  Russian  Federation.  However,  an  April  1996 
agreement  between  Russia  and  Belarus  to  set  a  timetable  for 
closely  coordinating  their  governments  and  foreign  policies 
brought  opposition  from  Kazakstan,  Turkmenistan,  and 
Uzbekistan,  which  saw  the  agreement  as  a  danger  to  their 
national  sovereignty. 

Other  Former  Soviet  Republics 

Although  a  strong  body  of  opinion  in  Belarus  supported  the 
April  1996  bilateral  agreement  that  would  bring  closer  integra- 
tion with  Russia,  independence-minded  Belarusians  in  Minsk 
staged  large-scale  protests,  and  the  policy  encountered  substan- 
tial opposition  in  Belarus's  parliament  and  among  reform  fac- 
tions in  Russia.  Nuclear  weapons  in  Belarus,  which  reportedly 
were  under  tight  Russian  control  after  1991,  were  scheduled 
for  transfer  to  Russia  by  the  end  of  1996. 

The  last  Russian  troops  left  Estonia  and  Latvia  in  1994,  leav- 
ing significant  populations  of  Russians  behind.  Russian  officials 
criticized  citizenship  and  other  laws  allegedly  discriminating 
against  those  groups  in  the  Baltic  republics,  and  some  Russian 
enclaves  in  the  Baltic  states  made  separatist  threats.  Border  dis- 


452 


Foreign  Relations 


putes  with  Estonia  and  Lativa  remained  unresolved  and  heated 
in  mid-1996. 

Azerbaijan,  which  anticipated  substantial  economic  rewards 
from  Western  development  of  its  Caspian  Sea  oil,  resisted  Rus- 
sian offers  to  station  peacekeeping  troops  in  its  war-torn 
Nagorno-Karabakh  region.  Azerbaijan's  president  Heydar 
Aliyev  was  a  former  member  of  the  Soviet  Politburo  and  came 
to  office  in  a  Russian-supported  coup  in  1993.  But  Aliyev  has 
proven  more  independent  than  Russian  policy  makers 
expected.  He  has  accused  Russia  (with  some  justification)  of 
supporting  Armenia  against  Azerbaijan  in  the  Nagorno-Kara- 
bakh conflict.  In  1994  Russia  demanded  and  received  a  10  per- 
cent interest  in  a  Western-dominated  oil  consortium  that  is  to 
develop  rich  offshore  Caspian  Sea  deposits  for  Azerbaijan.  Rus- 
sia called  for  construction  of  a  new  export  pipeline  that  would 
terminate  at  the  Russian  Black  Sea  port  of  Novorossiysk  and 
allow  Russia  to  collect  transit  fees  and  control  the  flow.  In 
1995-96  Russia  objected  to  a  territorial  delineation  of  Caspian 
Sea  resources  to  pressure  Azerbaijan  for  concessions  on  oil  rev- 
enue sharing  and  political  and  security  matters.  Azerbaijan 
decided  on  dual  routes  for  oil  shipments,  one  of  which  would 
bypass  Russian  territory  by  crossing  Georgia  to  reach  the  Black 
Sea. 

Many  Western  experts  believe  that  Russia's  relationship  with 
Ukraine  was  the  truest  test  of  its  willingness  to  accept  the  inde- 
pendence of  the  former  Soviet  republics.  After  regaining  its 
independence  at  the  end  of  1991,  Ukraine  argued  with  Russia 
over  the  division  of  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  and  the  disposition  of 
the  Crimean  Peninsula,  which  Nikita  Khrushchev  had 
"awarded"  to  the  Ukrainian  Soviet  Socialist  Republic  in  1954  to 
mark  the  300th  anniversary  of  the  union  of  Ukraine  and  Rus- 
sia. After  the  end  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  ethnic  Russians  who 
had  come  to  dominate  the  Crimean  Peninsula  lobbied  for 
autonomy  from  Ukraine  or  reunification  with  Russia.  Ukrai- 
nian-Russian relations  improved  after  the  election  of  Ukraine's 
president  Leonid  Kuchma  in  July  1994.  Russia  did  not  support 
Crimean  separatism,  and  both  countries  moved  toward  a 
peaceful  settlement  on  dividing  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  (see  Naval 
Forces,  ch.  9) .  The  United  States-Russian-Ukrainian  Trilateral 
Nuclear  Statement  signed  in  early  1994  resolved  many  disputes 
over  compensation  for  the  transfer  of  nuclear  weapons  from 
Ukraine  to  Russia,  and  Ukraine  transferred  its  last  nuclear 
weapon  to  Russia  in  June  1996.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 


The  United  States 

Relations  with  the  United  States  have  been  a  central  concern 
of  Soviet  and  Russian  foreign  policy  since  World  War  II.  The 
United  States  gained  unique  stature  in  the  Soviet  Union  when 
it  emerged  from  World  War  II  as  the  ultimate  guarantor  of 
European  security  against  attack  from  the  east  and  the  top  mil- 
itary power  in  the  NATO  alliance.  A  crucial  factor  of  Soviet- 
United  States  relations  was  the  mutual  nuclear  threat  that  arose 
in  the  1950s  as  the  Soviet  Union  developed  first  a  nuclear  capa- 
bility and  then  a  nuclear  strategy.  The  nuclear  threat  and  the 
underlying  potential  of  "mutually  assured  destruction"  created 
a  chilling  presence  for  the  rest  of  the  world.  A  high  point  in 
Soviet-United  States  relations  was  the  Anti-Ballistic  Missile 
Treaty  (ABM  Treaty)  that  resulted  from  the  Strategic  Arms 
Limitation  Talks  (SALT)  of  1972.  This  agreement  was  an  early 
achievement  of  the  detente,  or  easing  of  tensions,  that  pre- 
vailed between  the  superpowers  through  most  of  the  1970s 
until  the  December  1979  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan. 

The  early  1980s  were  a  time  of  tense  relations  and  confronta- 
tions. The  Soviet  occupation  of  Afghanistan  brought  trade  and 
cultural  embargoes  from  the  United  States  and  highly  visible 
gestures  such  as  the  United  States  boycott  of  the  1980  Summer 
Olympics  in  Moscow.  In  Europe  the  superpowers  publicly 
traded  threats  and  took  actions  such  as  the  deployment  of 
advanced  nuclear  weapons  while  they  exchanged  compromise 
positions  at  the  negotiating  table.  Several  events  of  1983 — the 
downing  of  a  South  Korean  civilian  airliner  by  the  Soviet  air 
force,  the  United  States  invasion  of  the  Caribbean  island  of 
Grenada  to  evict  a  Marxist  regime,  and  the  exit  of  the  Soviet 
delegation  from  arms  control  talks — kept  bilateral  tensions 
high. 

By  the  mid-1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  had  resumed  talks  on 
intermediate-range  nuclear  forces  and  strategic  arms  reduc- 
tion. During  that  period,  Soviet  leadership  underwent  a  major 
shift  from  Leonid  I.  Brezhnev,  who  died  in  November  1982,  to 
Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev,  who  became  general  secretary  in  March 
1985.  The  accession  of  Gorbachev  ultimately  ended  a  period  of 
strident  Soviet  propaganda  against  United  States  president 
Ronald  W.  Reagan,  whom  Russia  blamed  for  prolonging  Cold 
War  tensions  because  of  his  staunchly  anticommunist  positions. 

In  1985  Reagan  and  Gorbachev  began  a  series  of  annual 
summit  meetings  that  yielded  cultural  exchange  agreements, 
the  Intermediate-Range  Nuclear  Forces  Treaty  (INF  Treaty — 


454 


Foreign  Relations 


see  Glossary)  in  1987,  and  less  tangible  benefits.  The  sight  of 
the  "cold  warrior"  Reagan  consorting  with  his  Russian  opposite 
number  combined  with  the  instant  popularity  that  Gorbachev 
gained  in  the  United  States  to  again  warm  relations.  In  the 
mid-  and  late  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  also  stepped  up  media 
access  and  contacts.  Soviet  spokesmen  began  appearing  regu- 
larly on  United  States  television,  and  United  States  journalists 
received  unprecedented  access  to  everyday  life  in  the  Soviet 
Union. 

In  the  early  1990s,  relations  with  the  United  States  lost  none 
of  their  significance  for  Russia.  Russia  viewed  summitry  with 
the  United  States  as  the  mark  of  its  continued  status  as  a  great 
power  and  nuclear  superpower.  Presidents  Gorbachev  and 
George  H.W.  Bush  declared  a  United  States-Soviet  strategic 
partnership  at  the  summit  of  July  1991,  decisively  marking  the 
end  of  the  Cold  War.  President  Bush  declared  that  United 
States-Soviet  cooperation  during  the  Persian  Gulf  crisis  of 
1990-91  had  laid  the  groundwork  for  a  partnership  in  resolv- 
ing bilateral  and  world  problems.  For  Russia,  the  closer  rela- 
tions of  the  early  1990s  included  a  broad  range  of  activities, 
including  tourism  and  educational  exchanges,  the  study  of 
United  States  institutions  and  processes  to  adapt  them  for  a 
new  "Union  of  Sovereign  States"  (one  proposed  title  for  a  new, 
nonideological  Soviet  Union),  and  the  beginning  of  United 
States  aid  to  Russia. 

During  this  period,  the  Soviet  Union  and  subsequently  Rus- 
sia supported  the  United  States  on  several  international  issues. 
In  the  UN  Security  Council,  the  Soviet  Union  and  Russia  sup- 
ported sanctions  and  operations  against  Iraq  before,  during, 
and  after  the  Iraqi  invasion  of  Kuwait  in  1990;  called  on  the 
Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  to  abide 
by  safeguards  of  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency 
(IAEA);  supported  sending  UN  observers  to  conflict-ridden 
Georgia  and  Tajikistan;  and  supported  UN  economic  sanctions 
against  Serbia.  The  Soviet  Union  cosponsored  Middle  East 
peace  talks  that  opened  in  October  1991. 

In  its  cooperation  with  the  United  States  on  strategic  arms 
control,  Russia  declared  that  it  was  the  successor  to  the  Soviet 
Union  in  assuming  the  obligations  of  START,  which  had  been 
signed  in  July  1991.  The  Supreme  Soviet  ratified  this  treaty  in 
November  1992.  Presidents  Bush  and  Yeltsin  signed  the  second 
Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty  (START  II)  in  January  1993. 
The  United  States  ratified  that  treaty  in  January  1996,  but  the 


455 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

much  more  problematic  ratification  by  the  new,  nationalist- 
dominated  State  Duma  was  left  until  after  the  midyear  presi- 
dential election.  In  September  1993,  Russia  acceded  to  the  Mis- 
sile Technology  Control  Regime,  reaffirming  an  earlier 
decision  not  to  transfer  sensitive  missile  technology  to  India. 

However,  Soviet  and  Russian  parliaments  often  opposed  pol- 
icies that  they  deemed  helpful  to  the  United  States.  The 
Supreme  Soviet,  which  was  less  supportive  than  the  Gorbachev 
government  had  been  of  international  actions  against  Iraq, 
condemned  United  States  air  strikes  in  1993.  The  Supreme 
Soviet  approved  START  I  in  November  1992  with  some  condi- 
tions and  after  some  delay,  but  then  successive  parliaments 
conducted  hearings  and  debates  on  START  II,  without  ratifying 
the  treaty,  from  1993  through  mid-1996  (see  Nuclear  Arms 
Issues,  ch.  9). 

Beginning  in  1993,  the  Russian  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs 
issued  statements  critical  of  United  States  actions  and  policies. 
Some  United  States  observers  interpreted  them  as  part  of  a 
more  assertive  Russian  foreign  policy  that  insisted  on  protect- 
ing nebulous  Russian  vital  interests.  Other  observers  saw  such 
statements  primarily  as  rhetoric  designed  to  mollify  hard-line 
critics  of  Russian  foreign  policy  in  the  parliament  and  else- 
where. Events  corroborating  the  former  interpretation 
included  Russia's  opposition  to  NATO  membership  for  Central 
European  and  Baltic  states,  Russian  military  moves  in  Georgia 
that  raised  questions  of  its  intentions  in  the  near  abroad,  and 
Russia's  insistence  on  selling  nuclear  reactor  technology  to 
Iran,  as  well  as  doubts  about  Russia's  adherence  to  chemical 
and  biological  weapons  bans,  the  Conventional  Forces  in 
Europe  Treaty  (CFE  Treaty),  and  other  arms  control  pacts. 
Another  blow  to  United  States-Russian  relations  came  in  1994 
with  the  United  States  arrest  of  Aldrich  Ames,  a  longtime 
Soviet  and  Russian  spy. 

These  events  led  some  in  the  United  States  to  question  Rus- 
sia's commitment  to  bilateral  cooperation  and  the  soundness 
of  continued  United  States  aid  for  Russia.  Nevertheless,  many 
elements  of  bilateral  cooperation,  including  most  United 
States  aid  programs,  continued  in  1995.  From  its  high  point  in 
September  1993,  when  the  United  States  Congress  approved 
US$2.5  billion  in  aid  to  Russia  and  the  NIS,  the  amount  had 
declined  to  less  than  US$600  million  for  1996.  Only  about  one- 
third  of  the  1996  NIS  appropriation  was  earmarked  for  Russia. 
In  1995  Congress  placed  several  conditions  on  providing  aid  to 


456 


Foreign  Relations 


Russia,  such  as  requiring  that  Russia  reduce  assistance  to  Cuba. 
The  United  States  also  censured  Russian  behavior  such  as 
nuclear  energy  agreements  with  Iran  (see  Latin  America;  The 
Middle  East,  this  ch.). 

The  Yeltsin-Bush  Summits 

Before  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union,  President  Bush 
met  with  Boris  Yeltsin  in  1990,  when  Yeltsin  was  chairman  of 
the  Russian  Supreme  Soviet,  and  again  in  July  1991,  immedi- 
ately after  Yeltsin's  election  as  president  of  Russia.  After  the 
demise  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Yeltsin  met  with  Bush  at  a  full-scale 
summit  meeting  in  Washington  in  June  1992.  The  two  leaders 
then  agreed  on  many  of  the  START  II  terms,  and  a  joint  session 
of  the  United  States  Congress  enthusiastically  received  Yeltsin. 
According  to  some  observers,  that  summit  and  Yeltsin's  speech 
to  Congress  were  the  high  points  of  Russia's  conciliatory,  pro- 
Western  foreign  policy  orientation.  At  Bush's  final  summit  with 
Yeltsin  in  January  1993,  the  leaders  signed  the  landmark 
START  II  agreement. 

The  Yeltsin-Clinton  Summits 

The  administration  of  William  J.  Clinton,  which  took  office 
in  January  1993,  advocated  more  concerted  United  States 
efforts  to  aid  Russian  and  NIS  transitions  to  democracy  and 
market  economies.  The  justification  of  that  policy  was  that 
these  transitions  served  United  States  security  and  human 
rights  interests  and  would  provide  markets  for  United  States 
products.  The  April  1993  Vancouver  summit,  the  first  formal 
meeting  between  Yeltsin  and  Clinton,  furthered  United  States- 
Russian  cooperation  on  many  bilateral  issues.  The  resulting 
Vancouver  Declaration  pledged  the  two  sides  to  uphold  "a 
dynamic  and  effective  United  States-Russian  partnership."  The 
joint  communique  noted  Yeltsin's  pledge  to  continue  reform 
efforts  such  as  privatization. 

The  major  summit  initiative  was  finalization  of  a  United 
States  aid  package  of  US$1.6  billion.  On  bilateral  and  interna- 
tional security  issues,  the  two  sides  called  for  strengthening  the 
Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Treaty  (NPT)  and  urging  North 
Korea  not  to  carry  out  its  threat  to  withdraw  from  the  NPT.  The 
sides  also  agreed  to  work  for  implementation  of  the  START 
treaties. 

An  important  by-product  of  the  Vancouver  meeting  was  the 
Gore-Chernomyrdin  Commission,  which  initially  was  a  vehicle 


457 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

for  Vice  President  Albert  Gore  and  Prime  Minister  Viktor  Cher- 
nomyrdin to  work  out  the  details  of  bilateral  agreements  on 
space,  energy,  and  technology.  Between  1993  and  early  1996, 
the  two  men  met  six  times,  each  time  with  an  expanded 
agenda.  By  1996  the  commission  was  a  forum  for  establishing 
joint  endeavors  on  topics  ranging  from  the  sale  of  Siberian  tim- 
ber to  delivery  of  diphtheria  vaccine  to  rural  Russia.  The 
United  States  also  used  the  relationship  to  send  messages  to 
Yeltsin  on  urgent  diplomatic  topics  such  as  Bosnia  and  Chech- 
nya. In  1996  a  similar  commission  brought  Chernomyrdin  into 
regular  consultation  with  French  foreign  minister  Alain  Juppe. 

Whereas  the  Vancouver  summit  had  highlighted  economic 
aid  to  Russia,  the  Moscow  summit  of  January  1994  emphasized 
issues  of  arms  control  and  nonproliferation.  The  summit 
included  a  hastily  arranged  meeting  of  the  leaders  of  the 
United  States,  Russia,  and  Ukraine  that  produced  Ukraine's 
commitment  to  give  up  all  nuclear  weapons  on  its  territory  and 
sign  the  NPT.  The  meeting's  Trilateral  Nuclear  Statement  also 
committed  Russia  and  the  United  States  to  provide  Soviet-era 
"nuclear  powers"  Belarus,  Kazakstan,  and  Ukraine  with  security 
guarantees  in  exchange  for  giving  up  the  uranium  in  the 
nuclear  weapons  located  on  their  territory.  Presidents  Clinton 
and  Yeltsin  also  pledged  that,  beginning  in  May  1994,  strategic 
ballistic  missiles  no  longer  would  be  aimed  at  any  country.  This 
agreement  marked  the  superpowers'  first  cessation  of  the 
nuclear  operations  that  had  been  based  on  Cold  War  presump- 
tions of  mutual  enmity. 

A  potential  stumbling  block  to  the  success  of  the  1994  sum- 
mit was  Russia's  objection  to  proposals  for  early  admission  of 
some  Central  European  states  into  NATO  (see  Western 
Europe,  this  ch.;  The  NATO  Issue,  ch.  9).  Nevertheless,  the 
summit  communique  affirmed  that  the  new  European  security 
order  must  include  all  nations  as  equal  partners.  The  role  of 
Russia  in  its  near  abroad  was  also  an  important  point  of  discus- 
sion at  the  summit.  Yeltsin  sought  to  reassure  the  West  that  Rus- 
sia's  border  policy  was  aimed  only  at  stability,  not  neo- 
imperialist  goals.  Yeltsin  repeated  his  call  for  peacekeeping 
assistance  from  the  UN,  CSCE,  and  other  international  organi- 
zations and  complained  about  the  international  community's 
restrained  response  to  Russian  appeals  for  mediation  in  the 
conflict  regions  of  Georgia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Tajikistan. 

United  States  aid  played  a  less  prominent  role  in  the  Clin- 
ton-Yeltsin summit  in  Washington  in  September  1994.  Instead, 


458 


Foreign  Relations 


both  sides  emphasized  the  growth  of  future  bilateral  trade  and 
investment.  International  policy  differences  were  more  visible 
in  the  Washington  meeting  than  they  had  been  previously,  but 
both  sides  stressed  the  nonconfrontational  nature  of  the  "work- 
ing partnership"  in  resolving  differences.  The  two  presidents 
signed  a  framework  agreement  termed  the  Partnership  for 
Economic  Progress  (PFEP),  which  outlined  principles  and 
objectives  for  the  development  of  trade  and  economic  coopera- 
tion and  for  United  States  business  investment  in  Russia.  They 
also  planned  a  Commercial  Partnership  Program  to  help  guide 
Russia  toward  better  bilateral  commercial  relations.  United 
States  business  leaders  warned  Yeltsin,  however,  that  private 
investment  in  Russia  could  not  increase  appreciably  under  the 
still  capricious  and  complex  Russian  laws,  taxes,  import  duties, 
and  governmental  red  tape. 

A  major  initiative  at  the  summit  was  agreement  that  once 
Moscow  and  Washington  had  ratified  START  II,  the  two  sides 
would  quickly  remove  warheads  from  missiles  whose  launchers 
would  be  eliminated  under  START  II.  Other  initiatives  covered 
the  storage  and  security  of  nuclear  materials  and  continued 
moratoriums  on  nuclear  weapons  tests. 

The  conflict  in  Bosnia  remained  an  issue  of  contention. 
Yeltsin  refused  to  support  a  UN  Security  Council  resolution  lift- 
ing the  arms  embargo  against  Bosnia's  Muslim-led  govern- 
ment. The  United  States  also  voiced  concern  about  Russian 
peacekeeping  activities  in  former  Soviet  republics,  although 
Russia  insisted  that  its  actions  respected  the  sovereignty  of  the 
new  states.  Russian  recalcitrance  on  arms  sales  to  Iran,  classi- 
fied by  the  West  as  a  terrorist  state,  also  was  a  source  of  conflict. 
While  agreeing  that  no  new  arms  contracts  would  be  signed 
with  Iran,  Yeltsin  insisted  that  existing  commitments  would  be 
upheld. 

Three  issues  dominated  the  Clinton-Yeltsin  summit  meeting 
held  in  Moscow  in  May  1995 — NATO  enlargement,  Russia's 
sale  of  nuclear  reactors  to  Iran,  and  the  Chechnya  conflict.  In 
spite  of  their  differences  on  key  issues,  Clinton  and  Yeltsin 
pledged  to  continue  a  cooperative  relationship. 

The  two  leaders  referred  the  matter  of  nuclear  sales  to  Iran 
to  the  Gore-Chernomyrdin  Commission,  which  subsequently 
crafted  an  agreement  on  two  Russian  concessions  on  the  trans- 
fer issue.  On  the  subject  of  European  security,  the  two  sides 
underscored  the  importance  of  ongoing  integration  and  of 
joint  participation  in  international  bodies,  including  Russia's

membership  in  NATO's  Partnership  for  Peace  (PfP).  Discus- 
sions of  NATO  enlargement  remained  inconclusive. 

At  the  May  1995  summit,  President  Clinton  expressed  his 
expectation  that  Russia  would  meet  all  conditions  of  the  CFE 
Treaty,  which  was  due  to  come  into  full  force  in  November 
1995.  Meeting  this  deadline  would  require  withdrawing  several 
hundred  tanks  and  other  weapons  from  the  North  Caucasus 
region  of  Russia,  including  many  in  Chechnya.  At  the  review 
conference  in  May  1996,  Clinton  offered  to  support  modifica- 
tions to  the  CFE  Treaty  to  meet  Russia's  "legitimate  security 
interests."  Clinton  reiterated  United  States  concerns  about 
human  rights  abuses  in  Chechnya  and  called  for  a  permanent 
cease-fire.  Yeltsin  responded  by  calling  Russia's  Chechnya  cam- 
paign a  battle  against  terrorism  rather  than  a  conventional  mil- 
itary action. 

The  summit  meeting  of  October  1995,  held  in  Hyde  Park, 
New  York,  continued  the  previous  emphasis  on  the  most  con- 
tentious issues  of  bilateral  relations.  These  included  Russian 
nuclear  sales  to  Cuba  and  Iran,  objections  to  expansion  of 
NATO  in  Central  Europe  and  to  United  States  plans  to  build  a 
ballistic  missile  defense  system,  and  Russia's  noncompliance 
with  the  CFE  Treaty.  The  dominant  question  of  this  summit, 
which  yielded  no  agreements,  was  the  form  of  Russia's  partici- 
pation in  NATO-commanded  international  peacekeeping 
forces  to  be  sent  into  Bosnia.  Clinton  and  Yeltsin  referred  most 
of  the  contentious  issues  to  lower  levels  for  detailed  discussion 
and  emerged  from  the  summit  emphasizing  the  continued 
strength  of  Russian-United  States  cooperation. 

The  Moscow  summit  of  April  1996  took  place  during  presi- 
dential campaigns  in  both  countries.  It  also  followed  directly 
the  G— 7  meeting  on  nuclear  safety  and  security  in  Moscow.  As 
in  Hyde  Park,  the  two  leaders  emphasized  the  positive  aspects 
of  their  partnership  and  announced  progress  in  negotiations 
over  the  CFE  and  ABM  treaties,  but  without  citing  any  details. 
Yeltsin  briefed  Clinton  on  his  progress  toward  ratification  of 
the  START  II  agreement,  and  Clinton  criticized  Russia's  fears 
of  NATO  enlargement  as  completely  unfounded.  For  Yeltsin, 
the  meeting  was  an  opportunity  to  demonstrate  to  the  elector- 
ate that  the  leader  of  the  United  States  respected  him,  but  he 
also  felt  constrained  to  demonstrate  that  he  was  independent 
of  coercion  by  Clinton.

Foreign  Relations 


Western  Europe 

The  Soviet  Union's  relations  with  Western  Europe  following 
World  War  II  were  colored  heavily  by  Soviet  relations  with  East- 
ern Europe  and  by  the  Warsaw  Pact  forces  arrayed  in  Europe 
against  NATO  forces.  The  Soviet  influence  over  Eastern 
Europe,  punctuated  by  the  1956  invasion  of  Hungary  and  the 
1968  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia  and  by  a  constant  buildup  of 
conventional  and  nuclear  forces,  prompted  West  European 
NATO  member  nations  to  reinforce  their  defenses  and  dis- 
couraged direct  relations  between  those  nations  and  the  Soviet 
Union. 

The  Soviet  Union's  policy  toward  Western  Europe  had  five 
basic  goals:  preventing  rearmament  and  nuclearization  of  the 
Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany);  preventing  the 
political,  economic,  or  military  integration  of  Western  Europe; 
obtaining  West  European  endorsement  of  the  existing  territo- 
rial division  of  the  continent;  splitting  the  NATO  alliance  by 
encouraging  anti-Americanism  on  various  issues;  and  creating 
nuclear-free  zones  by  encouraging  European  peace  groups  and 
leftist  movements.  The  more  general  aim  was  to  make  Western 
Europe  as  similar  as  possible  to  the  Soviet  Union's  highly 
advanced  northwestern  neighbor,  Finland:  a  neutral  buffer 
zone  whose  political  reactions  could  be  anticipated  under  any 
circumstances,  and  which  would  refrain  from  commitments  to 
Western  nations.  In  the  early  1980s,  a  conflict  in  Western 
Europe  over  NATO  and  Warsaw  Pact  nuclear  installations 
accelerated  Soviet  efforts  to  neutralize  NATO's  European  con- 
tingent. The  Soviet  Union  tried  to  foster  a  European  detente 
separate  from  one  with  the  United  States.  The  effort  was 
defeated  because  West  European  governments  were  deter- 
mined to  uphold  and  modernize  NATO,  and  Soviet-sponsored 
peace  groups  failed  to  arouse  public  opinion  against  NATO 
participation. 

The  Soviet-era  division  of  Europe  into  two  distinct  military 
alliances  continues  to  influence  Russia's  policy  toward  Western 
Europe.  NATO  remains  an  active  presence  in  Western  Europe, 
and  Russia  sees  a  persistent  threat  that  NATO  will  embrace  the 
former  Warsaw  Pact  allies  and  leave  Russia  without  its  Euro- 
pean buffer  zone.  Because  of  this  perceived  threat,  sharpened 
in  the  rhetoric  of  Russian  nationalist  factions,  Russia  has  been 
reluctant  to  accommodate  West  European  nations  on  a  num- 
ber of  issues,  even  as  it  has  hastened  to  bolster  relations  in 
other  areas  such  as  commerce.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Even  before  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Yeltsin  pur- 
sued closer  relations  with  Western  Europe  on  behalf  of  the  Rus- 
sian Republic.  In  his  first  foreign  trip  after  the  failure  of  the 
August  1991  coup  had  substantially  improved  his  stature  as 
president  of  the  Russian  Republic,  Yeltsin  visited  Germany  to 
seek  safeguards  for  Germans  residing  in  Russia.  After  1991  Rus- 
sia's relations  with  Western  Europe  achieved  a  level  of  integra- 
tion and  comity  that  the  Soviet  Union  had  aspired  to  but  had 
never  reached.  The  draft  foreign  policy  concept  of  January 
1993  called  for  Russian  foreign  policy  to  consolidate  the 
emerging  partnership  with  the  states  of  Western  Europe,  but  it 
also  emphasized  that  Russia's  vital  interests  might  cause  dis- 
agreement on  some  issues.  Russia's  major  goals  included  gain- 
ing West  European  aid  and  markets,  recognition  of  Russia's 
interests  in  Central  Europe  and  the  CIS,  and  regional  coopera- 
tion in  combating  organized  crime  and  nuclear  smuggling. 
Germany  emerged  as  the  largest  European  aid  donor  to  Russia 
and  its  largest  trade  and  investment  partner. 

In  June  1994,  Yeltsin  and  the  leaders  of  the  European  Union 
(EU)  signed  an  agreement  on  partnership  and  cooperation. 
Pending  the  ratification  of  the  agreement  by  the  member 
states,  a  provisional  economic  accord  was  drawn  up  in  early 
1995  extending  most-favored-nation  status  to  Russia  and  reduc- 
ing many  import  quotas.  Because  of  Western  disapproval  over 
the  war  in  Chechnya,  the  EU  did  not  sign  the  agreement  until 
July  1995,  following  a  cease-fire  in  Chechnya. 

The  Council  of  Europe  also  sidelined  a  Russian  application 
for  membership  as  a  sign  of  disapproval  of  events  in  Chechnya, 
and  in  July  1995  the  council  issued  a  report  detailing  Russian 
(as  well  as  some  Chechen)  human  rights  abuses  in  Chechnya. 
After  the  conclusion  of  the  cease-fire,  Russian  officials 
requested  reconsideration  of  Russia's  application.  The  council 
granted  Russia  full  membership  in  January  1996.  European 
authorities  explained  that  admitting  Russia  into  Europe's  fore- 
most body  on  human  rights,  democracy,  and  the  rule  of  law 
would  promote  democratic  trends  in  Russia  more  effectively 
than  the  isolation  that  would  result  if  membership  were 
denied.  A  substantial  body  of  European  opinion  continued  to 
oppose  admission,  however,  especially  when  Russian  army 
attacks  on  Chechen  civilians  continued  and  Russia  failed  to 
impose  a  required  moratorium  on  capital  punishment  (see 
Chechnya,  ch.  9;  The  Criminal  Justice  System,  ch.  10).

Foreign  Relations 


In  February  1996,  the  Council  of  Europe  and  the  EU 
announced  an  aid  package  to  help  Russia  meet  the  legal  and 
human  rights  requirements  of  membership  in  the  council. 
Tensions  in  Russia's  relations  with  the  West  continued,  how- 
ever, with  its  refusal  in  April  1996  to  provide  arms  sales  data. 
These  data  are  necessary  for  establishment  of  a  military  tech- 
nology export  control  regime  to  replace  the  Coordinating 
Committee  for  Multilateral  Export  Controls  (CoCom),  which 
NATO  used  during  the  Soviet  era  to  monitor  world  arms  ship- 
ments. 

The  CFE  Treaty,  which  the  Soviet  Union  signed  in  1990, 
aimed  at  stabilizing  and  limiting  the  nonnuclear  forces  of  all 
European  nations.  Signed  in  the  context  of  the  NATO-Warsaw 
Pact  division  of  Europe,  the  treaty  remained  a  basis  for  reduc- 
tion of  tensions  in  Europe  after  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  Soviet 
Union  dissolved. 

Although  the  Russian  military  accepted  the  CFE  Treaty,  in 
the  ensuing  years  it  increasingly  insisted  that  the  signatories 
allow  modification  of  force  limits  on  Europe's  flanks,  which 
included  the  still  substantial  garrison  in  Kaliningrad  Oblast  on 
the  Baltic  and  the  troublesome  Caucasus  region  (see  The  Geo- 
political Context,  ch.  9).  In  the  early  1990s,  Russia  shifted 
much  weaponry  to  the  southern  flank  area  to  stabilize  its 
North  Caucasus  republics,  particularly  breakaway  Chechnya,  as 
well  as  the  independent  but  conflict-plagued  Caucasus  states  of 
Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia.  Although  NATO  proposed 
some  alterations  in  Russia's  flank  limits  in  September  1995, 
Russia  still  was  not  in  compliance  when  the  treaty  came  into 
full  force  in  November  1995.  Russia  met  the  treaty's  overall 
arms  reduction  targets,  however.  Russia  called  for  further  mod- 
ifications of  the  treaty's  troop  disposition  requirements  to  be 
put  on  the  agenda  of  a  planned  Mayl996  review  conference. 
After  intense  negotiations,  the  conferees  finally  agreed  to  allow 
Russia  to  retain  additional  equipment  in  the  southern  flank 
area  for  three  years. 

NATO 

The  January  1993  draft  foreign  policy  concept  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Foreign  Affairs  called  for  increasing  ties  with  NATO 
through  the  North  Atlantic  Cooperation  Council  and  other 
means,  including  military  liaison,  joint  maneuvers,  and 
exchange  visits.  Russia  objected  to  full  NATO  membership  for 
Poland  and  other  Central  European  states,  so  the  United  States 


463 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

proposed  establishment  of  NATO's  Partnership  for  Peace  (PfP) 
in  the  fall  of  1993.  The  PfP  was  to  be  an  ancillary  of  NATO, 
consisting  entirely  of  the  former  Warsaw  Pact  states  and  former 
Soviet  republics.  By  the  end  of  1995,  twenty-seven  states — the 
entire  complement  of  those  two  groups — had  joined.  Yeltsin 
supported  Russia's  membership  in  the  PfP  in  his  "state  of  the 
federation"  address  to  the  Russian  parliament  in  February 
1994,  but  he  opposed  the  future  inclusion  in  NATO  of  Central 
European  states  as  unacceptably  excluding  Russia  from  partici- 
pation in  European  affairs. 

In  response  to  NATO  air  strikes  on  Bosnian  Serb  forces  in 
April  1994,  Yeltsin  hinted  that  Russia  might  delay  signing  the 
PfP  agreement.  Instead,  Kozyrev  announced  shortly  thereafter 
that  the  Russian  ministries  of  foreign  affairs  and  defense  had 
decided  that  Russia  should  have  a  special  status  in  the  PfP  "to 
protect  it  from  hostile  acts  by  NATO."  In  May  1994,  the  Russian 
Security  Council  called  unsuccessfully  for  NATO  to  agree  to  a 
list  of  special  privileges  for  Russia.  The  Russian  delegation 
walked  out  of  the  December  1994  signing  ceremonies  for 
membership  in  the  PfP  before  finally  joining  in  June  1995. 

At  the  Budapest  meeting  of  CSCE  heads  of  state  in  Decem- 
ber 1994,  Russia  called  for  the  CSCE  to  transform  itself  into  the 
major  security  organization  in  Europe.  The  CSCE  rejected  Rus- 
sia's proposal,  but  it  did  agree  to  change  its  name  to  the  Organ- 
ization for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE)  to 
reflect  its  status  as  a  permanent  organization.  The  West  viewed 
Russia's  overture  as  seeking  a  new  forum  from  which  to  gain 
influence  over  NATO  and  other  Western  organizations. 
Through  1995  Russian  spokesmen  continued  their  criticism  of 
NATO,  including  its  air  strikes  in  Bosnia,  and  called  for  an 
alternative  European  security  structure.  Nevertheless,  Yeltsin 
vetoed  a  State  Duma  resolution  canceling  Russia's  PfP  member- 
ship. 

In  late  1995,  Russia  agreed  to  join  NATO's  efforts  to  enforce 
the  Dayton  Peace  Accords,  formally  signed  in  December  as  the 
Peace  Agreement  on  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  to  end  the  conflict 
in  Bosnia.  In  January  1996,  some  1,600  Russian  troops  arrived 
in  northern  Bosnia  to  work  closely  with  United  States  forces  as 
part  of  the  Bosnian  Peace  Implementation  Force  (IFOR).  In 
the  first  six  months  of  that  arrangement,  little  controversy 
arose  over  command  roles  or  goals.

Foreign  Relations 


Central  Europe 

Soviet  influence  in  Eastern  Europe  began  with  Soviet  occu- 
pation of  territories  during  World  War  II.  By  1949  communist 
regimes  had  been  put  into  place  in  all  the  occupied  states:  Bul- 
garia, Czechoslovakia,  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East 
Germany),  Hungary,  Poland,  and  Romania.  Under  the  leader- 
ship of  Josip  Broz  Tito,  Yugoslavia  maintained  an  independent 
position  as  a  communist  state  that  Soviet  leaders  first  vilified 
but  ultimately  recognized  in  1955.  Domination  of  the  East 
European  countries  belonging  to  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the 
Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  (known  as  Come- 
con — see  Glossary)  remained  a  fundamental  priority  of  Soviet 
foreign  policy  through  the  disintegration  of  both  organizations 
in  1991.  Soviet  leaders  used  the  continued  existence  of  socialist 
regimes  in  Eastern  Europe  as  part  of  the  ideological  justifica- 
tion of  socialism  at  home  because  it  fulfilled  the  Marxist-Lenin- 
ist recipe  of  the  rule  of  the  multinational  proletariat.  Because 
of  that  logic,  a  threat  to  Eastern  Europe  became  a  threat  to  the 
Soviet  Union  itself. 

In  the  1950s,  the  Soviet  military  used  force  to  restrain  mass 
expressions  of  resistance  to  conventional,  Soviet-backed 
regimes  in  East  Germany  (1953),  Poland  (1956),  and  Hungary 
(1956).  After  the  1968  Warsaw  Pact  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia 
quelled  political  liberalization  in  that  country,  the  irreversibil- 
ity of  communist  control  in  East  European  countries  was  for- 
mulated in  what  became  known  as  the  Brezhnev  Doctrine, 
which  for  the  next  twenty  years  was  the  foundation  of  Soviet 
policy  toward  the  region.  Soviet  policy  makers  determined  that 
occupation  forces  were  the  only  sure  guarantee  of  continued 
communist  rule  in  Eastern  Europe  and  that  some  limited  local 
control  over  domestic  policy  was  necessary  to  avoid  future  resis- 
tance. When  Polish  workers  pushed  their  demands  for  inde- 
pendent trade  unions  and  the  right  to  strike  in  1980-81,  the 
implicit  threat  of  invasion  by  Soviet  forces  led  Polish  police  and 
security  forces  to  quell  disturbances  and  a  new,  military  prime 
minister,  General  Wojciech  Jar uzelski,  to  declare  martial  law. 

In  the  mid-1980s,  Gorbachev's  internal  liberalization  was 
paralleled  by  his  doctrine  of  "many  roads  to  socialism,"  which 
called  for  cooperation  rather  than  uniformity  among  East 
European  nations.  That  call  coincided  with  the  implicit  revoca- 
tion in  1988  of  the  Brezhnev  Doctrine  as  Soviet  military  doc- 
trine recognized  the  need  to  conserve  resources  (see  Soviet 
Doctrine,  ch.  9).  Gorbachev's  internal  reform  programs  of  glas- 


465 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

nost  (see  Glossary)  and  perestroika  (see  Glossary)  received  vary- 
ing degrees  of  support  and  imitation  among  East  European 
leaders.  Regimes  in  Bulgaria,  Hungary,  and  Poland  showed 
substantial  support,  but  those  in  Czechoslovakia,  East  Ger- 
many, and  Romania  refused  to  adopt  the  type  of  far-reaching 
domestic  reforms  that  Gorbachev  introduced  at  home  (see 
The  Gorbachev  Era,  ch.  2).  Nevertheless,  by  the  late  1980s  the 
nature  of  Soviet  influence  had  shifted  unmistakably  away  from 
coercion  toward  political  and  economic  instruments  of  influ- 
ence. The  last  stage  of  Soviet  relations  with  the  region,  1989- 
91,  was  fundamentally  different.  By  1990  all  the  East  European 
member  states  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  Comecon  had  rejected 
their  communist  regimes  and  were  straining  toward  the  West. 
Although  Soviet  policy  makers  struggled  to  keep  the  two  multi- 
national organizations  alive  as  instruments  of  influence,  events 
had  rendered  them  moribund  before  their  formal  demise  in 

1991.  Now  the  world  redesignated  Eastern  Europe  as  Central 
Europe,  and  the  great  western  buffer  zone  disappeared. 

Immediately  after  the  collapse  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  and 
Comecon  and  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  rela- 
tions with  Central  Europe  were  a  relatively  low  priority  of  Rus- 
sian foreign  policy.  This  situation  began  to  change  during 

1992,  when  many  Russian  reformists  argued  that  closer  ties 
with  the  new  Central  European  democracies  would  bolster  Rus- 
sia's own  commitment  to  democratization.  Closer  commercial 
ties  also  would  make  Central  Europe's  relatively  inexpensive 
goods  more  readily  available  and  afford  better  opportunities  to 
make  valuable  connections  with  Western  Europe  as  the  former 
Warsaw  Pact  states  moved  closer  to  full  integration  into 
Europe. 

Russia's  January  1993  draft  foreign  policy  concept  stressed 
the  importance  of  Central  Europe.  The  concept  proclaimed 
that  the  region  "falls  within  the  historical  sphere  of  our  inter- 
ests" because  it  abuts  "the  belt  of  sovereign  states" — Ukraine, 
Belarus,  Moldova,  Lithuania,  Latvia,  and  Estonia — of  great 
interest  to  Russia.  The  concept  warned  against  attempts  by  the 
West  to  push  Russia  out  of  Central  Europe  and  to  make  the 
region  into  a  buffer  zone  that  would  isolate  Russia  from  West- 
ern Europe.  Russia  would  counter  such  movements  by  reestab- 
lishing good  trade  and  other  relations  with  the  Central 
European  states. 


466 


Foreign  Relations 


The  NATO  Issue 

The  draft  concept  did  not  present  NATO  involvement  in 
Central  Europe  as  inherently  threatening  to  Russian  interests. 
Later  in  1993,  however,  Yeltsin  reversed  course  under  the  polit- 
ical exigency  of  his  upcoming  confrontation  with  the  State 
Duma.  The  new  position  was  that  former  members  of  the  War- 
saw Pact  could  join  NATO  only  if  Russia  also  were  included. 
This  opposition  then  spurred  the  United  States  proposal  of  the 
Partnership  for  Peace. 

The  military  doctrine  that  Yeltsin  decreed  in  November 
1993  was  not  directed  clearly  at  NATO.  Calling  for  a  neutral 
Central  Europe,  the  doctrine  warned  that  Russia  would  inter- 
pret as  a  threat  the  expansion  of  any  alliance  in  Europe  to  the 
detriment  of  Russia's  interests  or  the  introduction  of  foreign 
troops  in  states  adjacent  to  the  Russian  Federation.  Through- 
out 1995  and  the  first  half  of  1996,  Russian  military  officials 
continued  to  demand  that  the  Central  European  states  remain 
neutral.  During  the  Moscow  visit  of  Poland's  president  Alex- 
ander Kwasniewski  in  April  1996,  Yeltsin  hailed  warmer  ties, 
but  he  noted  that  the  NATO  issue  remained  the  single  obstacle 
over  which  the  two  sides  disagreed. 

Russia's  Role  in  the  Former  Yugoslavia 

In  Russia's  debate  over  its  national  interests  and  in  Yeltsin's 
power  struggle  with  hard-liners,  a  major  issue  was  the  appropri- 
ate attitude  toward  Serbia,  a  long-time  ally  whose  aggression 
against  several  other  republics  of  the  former  Socialist  Federal 
Republic  of  Yugoslavia,  most  notably  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina, 
had  made  it  an  international  pariah.  The  key  question  was  how 
to  cooperate  with  Western  efforts  to  end  the  crisis  in  the 
former  Yugoslavia  while  preserving  Russia's  traditional  support 
of  Serbia. 

After  the  Serbian  government  expressed  support  for  the 
August  1991  coup  in  Moscow,  the  Yeltsin  government  of  the 
Russian  Republic  condemned  the  Serbian  attacks  of  late  1991 
on  Croatia,  one  of  the  two  initial  breakaway  republics  from  the 
Yugoslav  federation.  Russia  supported  efforts  in  the  UN  to 
compel  Serbia  to  accept  a  negotiated  settlement  of  the  conflict 
with  Croatia.  This  relatively  low-key  involvement  shifted  to  a 
more  active  policy  in  1993. 

The  1993  foreign  policy  concept's  language  on  the  former 
Yugoslavia  was  rather  neutral;  it  simply  called  for  Russia  to 
cooperate  with  the  UN,  the  CSCE,  and  other  parties  in  peace- 


467 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

making  efforts  and  to  use  its  influence  in  the  former  Yugoslavia 
to  encourage  a  peaceful  settlement.  As  it  began  to  speak  more 
specifically  for  Serbian  interests  later  in  1993,  Russia  hoped  at 
the  same  time  to  maintain  its  image  with  the  West  as  a  useful 
mediator  of  a  thoroughly  frustrating  conflict.  However,  this 
approach  caused  some  tensions  with  the  United  States  and  its 
Western  allies,  who  had  hoped  for  straightforward  Russian  sup- 
port of  UN-sanctioned  military  actions  against  Serbian  aggres- 
sion. Russian  hard-liners,  meanwhile,  urged  that  Russia  give 
priority  to  defying  what  they  called  a  "Western  drive  for  hege- 
mony" over  the  former  Yugoslavia  and  to  otherwise  protecting 
Russian  and  Serbian  geopolitical  interests. 

Hard-liners  in  Russia  and  Serbia  espoused  a  so-called  pan- 
Slavic  solidarity  that  emphasizes  ethnic,  religious,  and  histori- 
cal ties.  Its  adherents  shared  a  frustration  at  diminished  geopo- 
litical dominance  (in  Serbia's  case,  the  loss  of  influence  over 
other  parts  of  the  former  Yugoslavia,  and  in  Russia's  case  the 
loss  of  control  over  the  near  abroad).  Perceived  threats  to 
Serbs  and  Russians  now  outside  the  redrawn  borders  of  their 
respective  states  aggravated  this  frustration.  However,  the 
rocky,  thirty-five-year  relationship  between  the  Soviet  Union 
and  Tito's  Yugoslavia  disproved  the  natural  affinity  of  the  two 
nations. 

Russia  launched  a  more  assertive  phase  of  involvement  in 
the  former  Yugoslavia  when  it  opposed  NATO  air  strikes 
against  Bosnian  Serb  forces  around  Sarajevo  in  1994  and  1995. 
Russia  argued  that  there  should  be  no  air  strikes  until  peace 
negotiations  had  been  exhausted.  Russia  also  demanded  a 
larger  role  as  a  superpower  in  decision  making  on  UN,  NATO, 
and  other  international  actions  involving  the  former  Yugosla- 
via. 

In  August  1995,  Yeltsin  and  the  Russian  parliament  harshly 
criticized  intensified  NATO  air  strikes  on  Bosnian  Serb  military 
targets.  When  mediation  efforts  finally  led  to  a  cease-fire  in 
Bosnia  in  October  1995,  Russia  agreed  to  provide  troops  for  a 
NATO-sponsored  peacekeeping  force.  After  some  rearrange- 
ment of  lines  of  command  to  avoid  direct  NATO  command  of 
Russian  forces,  Russian  troops  joined  the  peacekeepers  in  Janu- 
ary 1996.  Although  it  cooperated  with  IFOR,  Russia  asserted  its 
views  on  other  aspects  of  the  Bosnia  situation.  In  February 
1996,  Russia  withdrew  unilaterally  from  UN-imposed  economic 
sanctions  on  Bosnian  Serbs,  arguing  that  the  Serbs  had  met  the 
conditions  for  withdrawing  the  sanctions.

Foreign  Relations 


China 

Relations  between  China  and  the  Soviet  Union  were  cool 
and  distrustful  from  the  mid-1950s  until  the  demise  of  the 
Soviet  Union.  Joseph  V.  Stalin  (in  office  1927-53)  fostered  an 
alliance  when  communists  took  over  mainland  China  in  1949. 
When  Khrushchev  announced  his  de-Stalinization  policy  in 
1956,  Chinese  leader  Mao  Zedong  sharply  disapproved,  and 
the  alliance  was  weakened.  In  1959  and  1960,  the  Sino-Soviet 
rift  came  to  full  world  attention  with  Khrushchev's  renuncia- 
tion of  an  agreement  to  provide  nuclear  technology  to  China, 
the  Soviet  withdrawal  of  all  economic  advisers,  and  mutual 
accusations  of  ideological  impurity.  Leonid  Brezhnev 
attempted  to  improve  relations,  but  serious  border  clashes  and 
Brezhnev's  proposal  of  an  Asian  collective  security  system  that 
would  contain  China  were  new  sources  of  hostility.  In  the 
1970s,  China  began  to  improve  relations  with  the  West  to 
counter  Soviet  political  and  military  pressure  in  Asia.  After 
Mao's  death  in  1976,  the  Soviet  Union  again  sought  to  improve 
relations  with  China.  But  polemics  were  renewed  in  1977,  and 
tension  between  two  Southeast  Asian  client  states,  Cambodia 
and  Vietnam,  further  damaged  relations.  In  1979  China 
invaded  Vietnam  to  defend  Cambodia  from  the  Vietnamese 
incursion  of  1978.  The  Soviet  Union  condemned  the  invasion 
and  increased  arms  shipments  to  Vietnam.  Competing  goals  in 
Southeast  Asia  remained  a  key  issue  for  nearly  a  decade. 

A  new  set  of  bilateral  negotiations  began  in  1979,  but  the 
Chinese  ended  talks  shortly  after  the  Soviet  Union  invaded 
Afghanistan  in  late  1979.  Thereafter,  China  added  withdrawal 
of  Soviet  troops  from  Afghanistan  to  its  conditions  for  renew- 
ing the  two  nations'  1950  friendship  treaty.  Talks  on  the  Sino- 
Soviet  border  situation  finally  resumed  in  late  1982,  but  rela- 
tions remained  static  until  Gorbachev  began  making  concilia- 
tory gestures  in  1986  and  1987.  In  1988  two  major  obstacles 
were  removed  when  the  Soviet  Union  committed  itself  to 
removing  troops  from  Afghanistan,  and  Vietnam  did  likewise 
for  Cambodia.  The  Sino-Soviet  summit  meeting  of  June  1989 
was  the  first  since  the  Khrushchev  regime. 

Russia's  foreign  policy  toward  China  generally  has  had  two 
goals:  to  preserve  a  counterweight  against  United  States  influ- 
ence in  the  Pacific  and  to  prevent  Chinese  regional  hegemony 
and  a  Sino-Japanese  alliance  that  could  exclude  Russia.  This 
balancing  act  appeared  in  Russia's  1993  foreign  policy  concept 
in  its  call  for  weighing  the  benefits  of  increased  Russian  arms 


469 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

sales  to  China  against  the  danger  of  re-creating  a  Cold  War 
arms  race  in  which  the  respective  proxies  would  be  Taiwan  and 
China.  Accordingly,  the  concept  endorsed  neighborly  and  sub- 
stantive relations  with  China  while  ensuring  that  "third  coun- 
tries," such  as  the  United  States  or  Japan,  would  not  be  able  to 
use  China  as  an  ally  against  Russia. 

In  the  early  1990s,  relations  got  a  boost  from  China's  interest 
in  renewed  weapons  imports  from  Russia  and  other  forms  of 
military  cooperation.  In  1992  an  exchange  of  visits  by  high 
defense  officials  established  defense  ties  and  included  the  sign- 
ing of  a  major  arms  technology  agreement  with  a  reported 
value  of  US$1.8  billion.  In  1993  another  series  of  defense 
exchange  visits  yielded  a  five-year  defense  cooperation  agree- 
ment (see  Foreign  Arms  Sales;  China,  ch.  9).  A  strategic  part- 
nership, signed  in  early  1996,  significantly  strengthened  ties. 

In  December  1992,  Yeltsin  went  to  China  and  signed  a  non- 
aggression  declaration  that  theoretically  ended  what  each 
called  the  other's  search  for  regional  hegemony  in  Asia. 
Another  treaty  included  Russian  aid  in  building  a  nuclear 
power  plant,  the  first  such  provision  since  Sino-Soviet  relations 
cooled  in  the  late  1950s.  Chinese  party  chairman  Jiang  Zemin 
visited  Moscow  in  September  1994  and  concluded  a  protocol 
that  resolved  some  border  disputes  and  generally  strengthened 
bilateral  ties.  During  Yeltsin's  visit  to  China  in  April  1996,  both 
sides  described  their  relationship  as  evolving  into  a  "strategic 
partnership,"  which  included  substantially  increased  arms 
sales.  At  the  April  meeting,  new  agreements  made  progress 
toward  delineating  and  demilitarizing  the  two  countries'  3,645 
kilometers  of  common  border.  Although  border  security  and 
illegal  Chinese  immigration  into  the  Russian  Far  East  were  con- 
troversial  issues  for  Russian  regional  officials,  Yeltsin 
demanded  regional  compliance  with  the  agreements.  Russia 
has  respected  China's  claim  that  Taiwan  is  part  of  its  territory, 
although  Russia's  trade  with  Taiwan  increased  to  nearly  US$3 
billion  in  1995  and  Russia  planned  to  open  trade  offices  on  the 
island  in  1996. 

In  1994-96  China  emerged  as  a  major  market  for  Russian 
arms,  having  bought  several  dozen  Su-27  fighter  aircraft  and 
several  Kilo-class  attack  submarines.  Russia  also  had  a  positive 
trade  balance  in  the  sale  of  raw  materials,  metals,  and  machin- 
ery to  China.  A  series  of  high-level  state  visits  occurred  in  1994 
and  1995.  Both  countries  pursued  closer  ties,  in  each  case 
partly  to  counterbalance  their  cooling  relations  with  the 


470 


Foreign  Relations 


United  States.  In  March  1996,  Russia  announced  that  it  would 
grant  China  a  loan  of  US$2  billion  to  supply  Russian  nuclear 
reactors  for  power  generation  in  northeast  China,  and  further 
cooperation  was  proposed  in  uranium  mining  and  processing, 
fusion  research,  and  nuclear  arms  dismantlement. 

Japan 

Historians  identify  the  crushing  victory  of  Japan  over  Russia 
in  the  Russo-Japanese  War  of  1904-05  as  the  beginning  of 
those  countries'  poor  relations.  After  World  War  I,  Japan  took 
Vladivostok  and  held  the  key  port  for  four  years,  initially  as  a 
member  of  the  Allied  interventionist  forces  that  occupied  parts 
of  Russia  after  the  new  Bolshevik  (see  Glossary)  government 
proclaimed  neutrality  in  1917.  At  the  end  of  World  War  II,  Sta- 
lin broke  the  neutrality  pact  that  had  existed  throughout  the 
war  in  order  to  occupy  vast  areas  of  East  Asia  formerly  held  by 
Japan.  His  action  resulted  in  the  incorporation  of  the  entire 
Kuril  Islands  chain  and  the  southern  half  of  Sakhalin  Island 
into  the  Soviet  Union,  and  it  created  an  issue  that  blocked  the 
signing  of  a  peace  treaty  and  forging  closer  relations.  In  the 
Gorbachev  era,  relations  thawed  somewhat  as  high  officials 
exchanged  visits  and  the  Soviet  Union  reduced  its  Far  East 
nuclear  forces  and  troops,  but  fundamental  differences 
remained  unchanged  when  the  Soviet  Union  dissolved. 

Since  World  War  II,  twin  concerns  have  dominated  Japanese 
relations  with  the  former  Soviet  Union:  the  East-West  Cold  War 
and  the  so-called  Northern  Territories — the  four  southernmost 
Kuril  islands — that  the  Soviet  Union  occupied  under  the  terms 
of  the  Yalta  Conference  in  1945  and  continued  to  occupy  on 
grounds  of  national  security.  The  dissolution  of  the  Soviet 
Union  initially  raised  Japanese  expectations  of  a  favorable  reso- 
lution of  the  islands  dispute  and  Russian  hopes  of  significant 
Japanese  economic  aid  and  investment  in  return.  But  the 
return  of  the  islands  to  Japan  remained  politically  inadvisable 
for  Soviet  and  Russian  leaders  throughout  the  first  half  of  the 
1990s. 

Just  before  he  became  de  facto  president  of  Russia  in  1990, 
Yeltsin  had  advanced  a  bold,  five-point  plan  to  deal  with  the  ter- 
ritorial issue.  After  initially  criticizing  the  plan,  the  Gorbachev 
government  incorporated  several  of  Yeltsin's  recommendations 
into  its  foreign  policy  position.  The  plan  envisioned  several 
steps  leading  to  a  full  peace  treaty,  without  a  firm  Russian  com- 
mitment to  return  the  islands,  and  in  1992  the  Russian  Federa- 


471 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

tion  continued  the  discussions  that  the  Gorbachev  regime  had 
initiated. 

However,  Japan  refused  to  increase  commercial  activity  with 
Russia  until  the  countries  resolved  the  territorial  issue  (by 
which  Japan  meant  that  Russia  would  recognize  its  sovereignty) 
and  signed  a  peace  treaty.  Russia  offered  only  to  return  two 
islands  after  a  peace  treaty  was  signed.  In  the  meantime, 
Yeltsin's  efforts  to  improve  bilateral  relations  faced  increased 
domestic  criticism  from  hard-line  legislators,  regional  officials 
in  Russia's  Far  East,  and  elements  within  the  military  establish- 
ment. In  1992  this  criticism  culminated  in  Yeltsin's  Security 
Council  forcing  an  embarrassing,  last-minute  cancellation  of  a 
presidential  trip  to  Japan.  Russia's  January  1993  foreign  policy 
concept  approached  the  problem  only  obliquely.  It  made  an 
improved  role  in  Asian  geopolitics  a  top  general  priority  and 
improved  relations  with  Japan  a  primary  specific  goal  in  that 
process. 

In  1993-96  Russo-Japanese  relations  showed  signs  of 
improvement,  although  there  were  also  repeated  setbacks  as 
both  sides  proposed  and  then  withdrew  conditions.  After  post- 
poning a  second  visit,  Yeltsin  finally  made  an  official  visit  to 
Japan  in  October  1993.  The  resulting  bilateral  Tokyo  Declara- 
tion represented  some  movement  on  both  sides,  but  Russia's 
dumping  of  nuclear  waste  in  the  Sea  of  Japan  and  the  issue  of 
Japanese  fishing  rights  off  the  Kuril  Islands  marred  relations  in 
the  ensuing  years.  In  1995  the  two  sides  came  close  to  agree- 
ments on  both  issues — including  Japanese  aid  to  build  sorely 
needed  nuclear  waste  processing  facilities  in  Russia's  Maritime 
(Primorskiy)  Territory — but  the  terms  of  the  treatment  plant 
remained  mired  in  controversy,  and  continued  Japanese  viola- 
tions stymied  the  fishing  agreement  in  1995  (see  Environmen- 
tal Conditions,  ch.  3). 

After  two  years  of  talks,  in  January  1996  Russia  reached  an 
agreement  with  Japanese  and  United  States  firms  to  build  a  liq- 
uid nuclear  waste  treatment  ship  with  financing  from  Russia, 
Japan,  and  the  United  States.  Negotiations  over  fishing  rights 
remained  deadlocked  after  a  fifth  round  of  talks  ended  in  Feb- 
ruary 1996,  and  Russian  border  troops  continued  to  fire  on 
Japanese  fishing  vessels.  The  Russians  protested  ajapanese  pro- 
posal to  extend  a  200-mile  economic  exclusion  zone  around  its 
coastlines,  in  line  with  Japan's  imminent  ratification  of  the  UN 
Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  prescribing  the  limits  of 
national  coastline  authority.  Because  of  the  proximity  of  the 


472 


Foreign  Relations 


two  countries,  such  a  zone  would  include  substantial  Russian 
coastal  waters.  Meanwhile,  the  Kuril  Islands  issue  remained 
unresolved  in  the  first  half  of  1996,  although  at  the  Moscow  G- 
7  meeting  the  two  sides  agreed  to  resume  talks. 

Other  Asian  States 

The  four  major  goals  of  Soviet  policy  in  Asia  were  defense  of 
the  Soviet  Union's  eastern  borders,  including  areas  disputed 
with  China,  Japan,  and  Mongolia;  maintenance  of  a  set  of  alli- 
ances with  key  nations  along  the  Asian  periphery;  improved 
relations  with  Western-oriented,  relatively  advanced  states  in 
order  to  obtain  assistance  in  developing  Siberia;  and  as  much 
isolation  as  possible  of  China,  South  Korea,  and  the  United 
States.  In  pursuit  of  these  goals,  the  main  instrument  was  the 
large  Soviet  military  presence  in  Asia,  which  backed  foreign 
policy  assertions  that  the  Soviet  Union  was  an  Asian  power.  In 
the  late  1980s,  Gorbachev  sought  to  update  this  approach  by 
improving  relations  with  China,  India,  and  Japan. 

According  to  the  1993  draft  foreign  policy  concept,  Russia 
aimed  to  correct  the  imbalance  in  the  former  Soviet  Union's 
East-West  relations  by  paying  greater  attention  to  ties  with 
Asian  states.  This  view  reflected  the  debate  in  Russian  foreign 
policy  between  the  westward-looking  so-called  Atlanticists  and 
the  so-called  Eurasianists  who  would  focus  on  relations  with  the 
near  abroad  and  the  wealthiest  Asian  states. 

Reflecting  the  Eurasian  alternative,  the  January  1993  con- 
cept called  for  a  flexible  policy  of  mutually  beneficial  relations 
with  all  the  states  of  Asia,  thus  fostering  good  relations  by 
reducing  Russian  military  forces  and  cooperating  with  the 
United  States  and  other  regional  powers  to  bolster  security  and 
regional  stability.  Such  cooperation  would  include  joint  pre- 
vention of  undesirable  and  unstable  behavior,  including  orga- 
nized crime  and  drug  dealing.  By  following  such  a  policy, 
Russia  would  come  to  be  seen  as  an  "honest  prospective  part- 
ner" in  the  region. 

Some  conservatives  argued  that  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet 
Union  pushed  Russia  geopolitically  toward  Asia  because  the 
great  bulk  of  Russia's  territory  and  resources  are  in  its  eastern 
regions  and  because  the  most  European  territories  of  the 
Soviet  Union — Belarus,  the  Baltic  states,  and  Ukraine — now 
were  gone.  Russian  territory  directly  abuts  three  Asian  powers: 
China,  Japan,  and  North  Korea.  The  security  of  the  large  popu- 
lations of  Russians  remaining  in  Central  Asia,  which  has  an 


473 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

extensive  border  with  China,  were  a  continuing  concern;  thus, 
events  such  as  changes  in  Chinese-Kazakstani  relations  have 
focused  added  Russian  attention  on  Asia.  Russia's  relations  with 
Mongolia,  an  adjoining  state  that  moved  decisively  out  of  the 
Soviet  sphere  of  influence  in  1991,  have  been  affected  by  sepa- 
ratism in  areas  of  Russia  bordering  Mongolia. 

Russia's  presence  and  influence  in  Asia  generally  declined  in 
the  early  1990s.  Elements  of  that  movement  were  shifts  of  eth- 
nic Russian  populations  away  from  areas  near  the  Russo-Chi- 
nese  border,  growing  anti-Russian  sentiment  in  Vietnam,  loss  of 
Russian  influence  over  an  increasingly  unpredictable  North 
Korea,  and  a  rapidly  expanding,  uncontrolled  Chinese  eco- 
nomic and  even  demographic  influence  in  Russia's  Far  East. 
Russia  soon  took  a  series  of  measures  to  stem  the  erosion  of  its 
influence,  including  efforts  to  maintain  and  rebuild  military 
ties  with  Vietnam  and  increased  arms  sales  to  China  and  Malay- 
sia. In  1993  and  1995,  Russia  protested  the  failure  of  the  Asia- 
Pacific  Economic  Conference  (APEC)  to  offer  it  membership, 
and  it  characterized  the  decision  as  a  national  insult. 

Analysts  interpreted  the  replacement  of  Kozyrev  with  Middle 
East  specialist  Primakov  in  early  1996  as  marking  a  further  tilt 
of  Russian  foreign  policy  toward  the  Eurasian  emphasis.  Early 
in  his  term,  Primakov  noted  that  his  priorities  would  include 
reinforcing  ties  with  the  former  Soviet  republics  and  with  such 
countries  as  China,  Japan,  and  the  Middle  Eastern  states.  At  the 
same  time,  Russia  announced  a  new  trade  policy  that  called  for 
increased  commercial  links  with  China,  Pakistan,  India,  and 
South  Korea,  among  other  Asian  nations.  Yeltsin  reaffirmed 
the  new  emphasis  in  his  1996  state  of  the  federation  speech. 
Economic  interests  played  a  large  part  in  this  change.  In  1995 
exports  to  Asian  countries  had  increased  to  US$20  billion, 
more  than  one-quarter  of  Russia's  total  trade  that  year.  Many 
Russian  analysts  observed  that  economically  sound  and  techno- 
logically developed  Asian  states  could  provide  markets,  tech- 
nology, and  investments  at  advantageous  terms. 

Soviet  policy  in  Southeast  Asia,  aimed  at  limiting  the  influ- 
ence of  China  and  eliminating  the  influence  of  the  United 
States,  was  not  especially  successful  in  the  1970s.  In  1978  sup- 
port for  Vietnam's  invasion  of  Cambodia  eliminated  the  pro- 
Chinese  government  of  Cambodia,  but  it  also  pushed  the  mem- 
ber states  of  the  pro-Western  Association  of  Southeast  Asian 
Nations  (ASEAN)  to  cooperate  more  closely  among  themselves 
and  with  the  United  States.  In  the  late  1980s,  Russia  established 


474 


Foreign  Relations 


bilateral  ties  with  ASEAN  states  as  part  of  Gorbachev's  revised 
Third  World  policies,  which  included  improved  relations  with 
Asian  nations  of  all  economic  descriptions. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Russia's  efforts  to  improve  relations  with 
Vietnam  met  significant  obstacles.  In  October  1993,  the  two 
sides  discussed  extending  Russian  use  of  the  port  at  Gam  Ranh 
Bay  beyond  its  expiration  date  in  the  year  2005.  Vietnam  called 
for  rental  payments  for  use  of  the  base,  but  the  two  countries 
reached  no  agreement.  During  Kozyrev's  July  1995  visit  to  Viet- 
nam, the  two  sides  discussed  enhancing  bilateral  and  regional 
cooperation,  which  had  reached  a  low  level.  Stumbling  blocks 
to  improved  relations  included  Vietnam's  repayment  of  its 
large  debt  to  Russia,  Russia's  desire  to  repatriate  many  of  the 
50,000  to  80,000  Vietnamese  guest  workers  stranded  in  Russia 
after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  and  the  status  of  Cam 
Ranh  Bay.  Vietnam  also  requested  that  Russia  aid  its  army  in 
modernizing  itself  as  a  counterweight  to  China,  which  remains 
a  regional  threat. 

In  the  Soviet  period,  India  was  among  the  Third  World  states 
that  responded  the  most  positively  to  Soviet  overtures,  and  the 
closeness  of  Indian-Soviet  relations  was  a  source  of  tension 
between  China  and  the  Soviet  Union.  In  turn,  the  Soviet  Union 
saw  India  as  an  important  means  of  containing  Chinese  expan- 
sionism. Despite  occasional  declines,  relations  with  India 
remained  close  through  the  end  of  the  Gorbachev  era,  and 
India  profited  from  abundant  military  and  other  foreign  aid. 

On  a  visit  to  India  in  January  1993,  Yeltsin  stressed  that  con- 
tinued good  relations  were  pivotal  to  Russia's  balanced  foreign 
relations,  including  its  pro-Eastern  policy.  Although  Russian 
trade  with  India  had  plummeted  in  the  early  1990s,  commer- 
cial relations  recovered  somewhat  in  1994-95  following  the 
establishment  of  an  Indian-Russian  Joint  Commission.  Much  of 
the  trade  was  linked  to  Indian  repayment  of  past  debts. 

In  March  1996,  Primakov  became  the  first  Russian  foreign 
minister  to  visit  India.  At  that  time,  he  termed  India  a  priority 
partner,  and  he  signed  an  agreement  reestablishing  the  Soviet- 
era  hot  line  communications  link  between  New  Delhi  and  Mos- 
cow. Primakov  stressed  that  both  Russia  and  India  were  seeking 
closer  relations  with  China  and  that  those  new  ties  would  not 
threaten  the  closer  Russian-Indian  ties. 

Relations  with  communist  North  Korea  and  capitalist  South 
Korea,  defined  clearly  by  the  dichotomy  of  the  Cold  War, 
changed  noticeably  in  the  early  1990s.  The  January  1993  for- 


475 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

eign  policy  concept  endorsed  the  goal  of  a  peaceful  Korean 
unification  to  reduce  regional  instability  on  Russia's  borders. 
Although  the  concept  called  for  full  ties  with  South  Korea, 
which  it  described  as  sharing  Russia's  "basic  values  of  world  civ- 
ilization," the  concept  also  urged  the  maintenance  of  some 
levers  of  containment  over  North  Korea  to  prevent  that  coun- 
try from  developing  nuclear  arms. 

The  Soviet  Union's  treaty  ties  with  North  Korea  included  the 
friendship,  cooperation,  and  mutual  assistance  treaty  of  1961. 
After  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Kozyrev  indicated  that 
many  of  the  Soviet  friendship  treaties  would  be  reevaluated, 
but  at  that  time  Russia  did  not  renounce  the  pact  with  North 
Korea.  In  August  1995,  Russia  forwarded  a  new  draft  "friendly 
relations"  treaty  to  North  Korea  that  excluded  a  crucial  provi- 
sion calling  for  mutual  military  assistance  in  the  case  of  attack. 
In  April  1996,  a  Russian  government  delegation  traveled  to 
P'yongyang  to  discuss  that  proposal  and  to  convince  North 
Korea  to  halt  bellicose  moves  along  its  border  with  South 
Korea. 

North  Korea's  inconsistent  positions  on  the  issue  of  nuclear 
technology  have  been  a  major  concern  for  Russia.  The  Russian 
Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  criticized  North  Korea's  March  1993 
announcement  that  it  would  withdraw  from  the  Nuclear  Non- 
proliferation  Treaty  (NPT),  and  Russia  subsequently  supported 
the  international  community  in  urging  North  Korea  to  adhere 
to  the  NPT  as  a  nonnuclear  weapons  power  and  to  accept  inter- 
national inspections  of  its  nuclear  facilities.  To  ease  the  tension 
caused  by  the  potential  of  nuclear  weapons  in  the  two  Koreas, 
Russia  called  an  international  conference  to  declare  the 
Korean  Peninsula  a  nuclear-free  zone.  In  October  1994,  Russia 
endorsed  a  United  States-North  Korean  agreement  on  halting 
North  Korean  nuclear  proliferation  while  urging  that  Russian 
reactors  be  supplied  to  North  Korea  under  the  agreement. 
Moscow  criticized  the  decision  to  supply  South  Korean  reactors 
instead,  and  the  new  disagreement  became  another  sore  point 
in  United  States-Russian  relations. 

Other  issues  of  conflict  between  Russia  and  North  Korea 
were  allegations  of  human  rights  violations  against  North 
Korean  guest  workers  in  Siberian  forests  and  North  Korea's 
unpaid  debt  to  Russia  of  more  than  US$3  billion.  In  1995  Rus- 
sian conservatives  urged  renewal  of  arms  sales  and  other  ties 
with  North  Korea  as  a  means  of  encouraging  it  to  repay  the 
debt.

On  his  1992  visit  to  South  Korea,  Yeltsin  signed  the  Treaty  on 
Principles  of  Relations,  which  called  for  relations  to  be  based 
on  "common  ideals  of  freedom,  democracy,  respect  for  human 
rights,  and  the  principles  of  a  market  economy."  This  treaty 
placed  Russia  in  the  unique  position  of  having  treaty  ties  with 
both  North  and  South  Korea,  each  based  on  fundamentally  dif- 
ferent principles.  Russia  and  South  Korea  reportedly  also  dis- 
cussed joint  projects  in  natural  gas  exploitation  and  industrial 
development.  In  1995  the  two  countries  signed  an  agreement 
that  alleviated  a  sore  point  in  relations  by  authorizing  Russia  to 
partially  repay  its  debt  to  South  Korea  in  goods.  Russian  arms 
transfers  have  included  T-80  tanks  and  BMP-3  armored  fight- 
ing vehicles.  South  Korea  is  assisting  in  the  development  of  an 
industrial  park  in  the  Russian  city  of  Nakhodka,  a  port  on  the 
Sea  of  Japan  that  Russia  has  declared  a  free  economic  zone. 

The  Third  World 

The  Cold  War  affected  the  relations  the  United  States  and 
the  Soviet  Union  had  with  Third  World  states.  Both  superpow- 
ers wooed  Third  World  allies,  many  of  which  used  the  Cold 
War  to  extract  favorable  aid  as  the  price  of  closer  relations.  The 
Soviet  Union  endeavored  to  construct  socialism  in  the  Third 
World  to  demonstrate  that  Marxism-Leninism  would  someday 
triumph  worldwide.  Many  of  its  so-called  client  states  were  pro- 
claimed as  "socialist  oriented"  or  following  the  path  of  "non- 
capitalist  development,"  and  the  Soviet  Union  signed 
friendship  treaties  and  other  security  and  aid  agreements  with 
them.  Some  Third  World  states,  however,  involved  themselves 
in  the  influential  Nonaligned  Movement,  which  began  in  1955 
and  represented  more  than  half  the  world's  population.  Most 
of  those  countries  formally  eschewed  major  security  and  other 
relations  with  the  superpowers,  with  conspicuous  exceptions 
such  as  Cuba.  At  some  stages  of  its  existence,  however,  the  Non- 
aligned  Movement  appeared  to  have  a  pro-Soviet  bias. 

The  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  broke  most  of  Russia's  ties 
with  Third  World  states.  The  Soviet  ideological  mission  of  fos- 
tering socialism  also  ceased.  Russia  was  unable  to  continue  eco- 
nomic subsidies  to  client  regimes,  including  the  Soviet-installed 
regime  in  Afghanistan  that  collapsed  in  1992.  Russia  continued 
to  play  a  reduced  role  in  some  of  the  regional  peace  negotia- 
tion efforts  it  had  inherited  from  the  Soviet  Union,  notably  in 
the  Middle  East  and  in  Cambodia.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Relations  with  Africa  received  a  relatively  low  priority,  and  in 
1992  Russia  closed  nine  embassies  and  four  consulates  on  that 
continent.  Relations  with  some  African  states  already  had  wors- 
ened in  late  1991  when  Yeltsin  ordered  the  end  of  all  foreign 
aid  and  demanded  immediate  repayment  of  outstanding  debts. 
Most  African  states  responded  that  their  debts  with  the  former 
Soviet  Union  should  be  forgiven  or  reduced  because  they  had 
been  largely  military  outlays  resulting  from  a  moribund  super- 
power rivalry. 

The  January  1993  draft  foreign  policy  concept  made  no 
mention  of  Russian  support  for  former  Soviet  client  states  in 
Africa  or  elsewhere.  Instead,  the  concept  emphasized  the  use 
of  diplomatic  leverage  to  induce  payment  of  debts  by  those 
states.  Beginning  in  mid-1994,  a  shift  began  toward  increased 
economic  ties  with  more  economically  developed  African  states 
such  as  South  Africa  and  Nigeria. 

The  Middle  East 

The  Middle  East  was  among  the  most  important  Third 
World  regions  for  Soviet  foreign  policy  and  national  security. 
The  Soviet  Union  shared  boundaries  with  Middle  Eastern 
states  Iran  and  Turkey,  and  some  of  those  states'  ethnic,  reli- 
gious, and  language  groups  also  were  represented  on  the 
Soviet  side  of  the  border.  The  region's  oil  resources  and  ship- 
ping lanes  were  of  significant  interest  to  the  Soviet  Union  and 
to  the  West.  After  World  War  II,  the  main  Soviet  goal  in  the 
region  was  to  minimize  the  influence  of  the  United  States. 
Toward  that  end,  the  Soviet  Union  gave  large-scale  support  to  a 
group  of  radical  Arab  states  that  were  united  by  their  quest  to 
eliminate  Israel  and  to  oust  all  vestiges  of  Western  influence  in 
the  region.  At  various  times,  the  strategy  also  included  exten- 
sive economic  assistance  to  NATO  member  Turkey,  unsuccess- 
ful attempts  at  negotiation  of  the  Iran-Iraq  War  in  the  mid- 
1980s  (during  a  period  of  strained  relations  with  both  coun- 
tries), and,  in  the  late  1980s,  pursuit  of  closer  relations  with 
moderate  states  of  the  region  such  as  Bahrain,  Egypt,  Jordan, 
Kuwait,  and  Saudi  Arabia  as  well  as  United  States  ally  Israel.  In 
1987  the  Soviet  Union  protected  Kuwaiti  shipping  in  the  Per- 
sian Gulf  against  Iranian  attack,  and  it  established  consular 
relations  with  Israel.  At  the  same  time,  the  Soviet  Union  contin- 
ued ties  with  radical  regimes  in  Libya,  Syria,  and  the  People's 
Democratic  Republic  of  Yemen  (South  Yemen).

Foreign  Relations 


In  the  last  years  of  the  Soviet  Union,  influence  with  Libya, 
Iraq,  the  Palestine  Liberation  Organization  (PLO),  and  Kuwait 
ebbed,  and  the  Soviet  Union  played  a  peripheral  role  in  the 
Persian  Gulf  War  of  1991.  Despite  its  friendship  treaty  with 
Iraq,  the  Soviet  Union  supported  the  United  States-led  interna- 
tional effort  to  reverse  Iraq's  occupation  of  Kuwait.  After  the 
war,  the  Soviet  Union  found  itself  marginalized  by  United 
States  dominance  in  the  region.  The  Soviet  Union  played  a 
minor  but  significant  role  as  co-coordinator  with  the  United 
States  of  peace  talks  between  Israel  and  the  Arab  states  that 
began  in  January  1992. 

The  independence  of  the  five  former  Soviet  Central  Asian 
republics  put  a  geographical  barrier  between  Russia  and  the 
states  of  the  Middle  East.  Some  Russian  democrats  and  some 
ultranationalists  believed  that  the  Soviet  Union's  involvement 
with  Islamic  states  such  as  Afghanistan  and  the  Central  Asian 
republics  had  drained  resources  and  harmed  Russia's  eco- 
nomic and  political  development  and  stability.  This  sentiment 
was  a  major  factor  in  the  original  formulation  of  the  CIS,  which 
included  only  the  Slavic  republics  in  that  new  organization  and 
added  the  Central  Asian  and  Caucasus  states  only  at  the  insis- 
tence of  Kazakstan's  president  Nursultan  Nazarbayev. 

Beginning  in  1993,  however,  Russian  policy  toward  the  Mid- 
dle East  and  the  Persian  Gulf  became  more  assertive  in  selected 
areas.  In  late  1992,  Russia  endeavored,  with  limited  success,  to 
prevent  Iran  from  supporting  the  Islamic  elements  of  a  coali- 
tion government  in  Tajikistan,  then  under  siege  by  antireform- 
ist  Tajikistani  elements.  On  other  issues,  Iran  and  Russia 
pursued  similar  interests  in  constraining  anti-Russian  and  anti- 
Iranian  political  currents  in  Azerbaijan,  and  Iran  used  relations 
with  Russia  to  counteract  United  States-led  international  eco- 
nomic and  political  ostracism. 

A  major  factor  in  renewed  Russian  interest  in  the  region  was 
the  prospect  of  arms  sales  and  other  trade,  which  were  the 
goals  of  Chernomyrdin's  visit  to  Saudi  Arabia  and  other  Persian 
Gulf  states  in  November  1994.  In  December  1994,  Russia 
signed  a  trade  agreement  with  Egypt  with  the  stated  purpose  of 
resuming  Egypt's  Soviet-era  position  as  the  most  important 
trade  partner  in  the  Middle  East.  Russia  moved  to  reestablish 
its  earlier  lucrative  arms  sales  ties  with  Iran,  selling  that  country 
fighter  aircraft,  tanks,  submarines,  fighter-bombers,  and  other 
arms.  Kuwait,  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  and  Algeria  also  made 
arms  purchases  in  the  early  1990s,  as  did  Egypt  and  Syria.  How- 


479 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 


ever,  the  level  of  Russian  arms  sales  remained  low  compared 
with  the  previous  decades  of  high  Soviet  visibility  in  the  region. 
In  1996  Russia  continued  to  observe  international  bans  on 
arms  sales  to  Libya  and  Iraq. 

Ultranationalists  and  other  deputies  in  the  Russian  parlia- 
ment called  for  rebuilding  ties  with  Iraq  and  condemned 
United  States  air  strikes  against  that  country  in  January  and 
June  1993.  Among  Russia's  overtures  for  better  relations  was  an 
appeal  in  the  UN  Security  Council  for  easing  international  eco- 
nomic sanctions  on  Iraq,  but  in  late  1995  these  efforts  were  set 
back  by  revelations  that  Iraq  was  seeking  to  develop  a  nuclear 
weapons  program.  The  apparently  poor  performance  of  Rus- 
sian equipment  during  the  Persian  Gulf  War  discouraged  many 
Middle  Eastern  states  from  buying  Russian  arms.  Another  neg- 
ative effect  on  Russia's  ties  with  the  Middle  East  was  Russia's 
aggression  against  Chechen  Muslims  and  its  stance  favoring 
Serbia  against  Muslim  Bosnia. 

A  series  of  Russian  contracts  to  build  nuclear  power  plants 
and  to  share  nuclear  technology  with  Iran  became  a  major 
international  issue  and  a  source  of  particular  friction  with  the 
United  States.  The  initial  1993  contract  was  not  fulfilled;  a  new 
contract,  worth  a  reported  US$800  million,  called  for  construc- 
tion of  a  nuclear  reactor  on  the  Persian  Gulf.  In  September 
1995,  Moscow  announced  a  further  contract  to  build  two  addi- 
tional, smaller  reactors.  Although  the  United  States  strongly 
protested  what  it  viewed  as  potential  nuclear  proliferation  to  a 
terrorist  state,  Russia  responded  that  international  law  permit- 
ted such  deals  and  that  the  reactors  would  be  under  full  safe- 
guards of  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency. 

Russian  diplomats  encouraged  Arab  participation  in  the 
Arab-Israeli  peace  talks  that  began  in  1992,  and  Russians  partic- 
ipated in  talks  between  Israel  and  the  PLO  on  the  issue  of  PLO 
self-rule  in  Israeli-occupied  territories.  Among  other  reasons, 
Russia  supported  the  peace  process  as  a  means  of  reducing  the 
threat  of  the  spread  of  Islamic  fundamentalism. 

Russian  foreign  minister  Primakov  launched  shuttle  diplo- 
macy in  the  Middle  East  in  April  1996  in  an  attempt  to  end 
fighting  in  southern  Lebanon  and  to  increase  Russia's  diplo- 
matic role  in  the  region.  However,  Russia's  condemnation  of 
Israeli  attacks  against  militant  Arab  Hezbollah  guerrillas  in 
southern  Lebanon  led  Israel  to  respond  that  it  preferred  the 
more  evenhanded  diplomatic  approach  of  the  United  States. 
Russia  subsequently  was  excluded  from  a  multilateral  force

agreed  upon  by  Israel,  Lebanon,  and  Syria  to  monitor  a  United 
States-brokered  cease-fire  in  Lebanon. 

Latin  America 

In  the  Soviet  period,  the  main  reasons  for  involvement  in 
Latin  America  were  not  historical,  cultural,  or  economic,  but 
related  to  strategic  competition  with  the  United  States.  Accord- 
ingly, the  Soviet  Union  endeavored  to  foster  leftist  insurgencies 
and  other  distractions  to  interfere  with  United  States  foreign 
policy  in  the  region. 

The  main  bases  of  Soviet  involvement  in  Latin  America  were 
Cuba  and  Nicaragua,  but  the  Soviet  Union  also  attempted 
some  involvement  in  Peru  and  Grenada.  The  Soviet  Union 
placed  military  and  intelligence  facilities  in  Cuba  to  spy  on  the 
United  States.  It  also  supported  Cuba  as  an  attractive  and  suc- 
cessful model  of  Latin  American  socialism  that  would  induce 
other  countries  to  move  into  the  same  sphere  and  become 
export  bases  for  ideology.  In  1962  Khrushchev  attempted  to 
redress  Soviet  strategic  nuclear  inferiority  by  surreptitiously 
placing  intermediate-range  nuclear  missiles  in  Cuba.  The 
resulting  crisis  brought  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union 
to  the  brink  of  war.  Although  tensions  over  Cuba  subsided  con- 
siderably in  the  decades  that  followed,  Cuba  remained  an 
important  Soviet  outpost  until  the  Gorbachev  regime  began 
substantially  cutting  aid  in  the  late  1980s.  The  other  potential 
outpost  of  communism  in  Latin  America,  Nicaragua,  was  lost 
when  a  free  election  rejected  the  procommunist  Sandinista 
Party  in  1990.  Meanwhile,  Soviet  purchases  of  grain  and  other 
goods  from  Latin  America  slumped  severely  in  the  decade 
before  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  thereafter  because 
of  the  Soviet  Union's  inability  to  pay  in  hard  currency  (see 
Glossary) . 

The  January  1993  draft  foreign  policy  concept  viewed  rela- 
tions with  Latin  America  as  particularly  important  for  Russia's 
economic  development.  Russia  saw  the  Latin  American  coun- 
tries, particularly  Argentina,  Brazil,  and  Mexico,  as  a  source  of 
low-price  food  and  other  goods  for  the  Russian  market,  as  a 
source  of  mutually  beneficial  technological  cooperation,  and 
as  a  market  for  arms.  The  1993  concept  called  for  establishing 
and  consolidating  ties  with  regional  organizations  such  as  the 
Organization  of  American  States,  in  which  Russia  is  a  perma- 
nent observer.  The  concept  was  vague  about  relations  with 
Cuba,  Nicaragua,  El  Salvador,  and  Guatemala,  and  it  avoided 


481 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

mention  of  Soviet-era  support  for  Marxist-Leninist  ideological 
movements  in  those  states. 

Some  Russian  analysts  argued  for  revival  of  the  mutually 
profitable  pre-Soviet  trade  ties  that  had  exchanged  goods  from 
Siberia  for  goods  from  Latin  America.  These  analysts  advo- 
cated obtaining  Latin  America's  trade  products — coffee,  cocoa, 
sugar,  fruit,  footwear,  and  oil — in  exchange  for  Siberian  timber, 
coal,  fish,  and  furs.  Some  also  argued  that  Russia's  trade  in  the 
entire  Pacific  Basin  should  intensify  to  compensate  for  the  loss 
of  ports  on  the  Baltic  and  Black  seas. 

In  the  first  post-Soviet  years,  the  Russian  government 
received  criticism  from  nationalist  factions  for  declining  trade 
and  lax  diplomacy  with  Latin  America.  In  1993  commercial 
activity  recovered  somewhat  as  Brazil  and  Russia  concluded  a 
trade  agreement  that  was  worth  about  US$2  billion  and 
included  arms  purchases  by  Brazil.  In  1994  Vladimir  Shu- 
meyko,  speaker  of  the  Federation  Council,  Russia's  upper  legis- 
lative chamber,  toured  Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Ecuador,  and 
Venezuela.  Many  Russians  urged  restored  ties  with  Cuba,  Nica- 
ragua, and  Peru  in  order  to  persuade  those  states  to  pay  back 
Soviet-era  loans.  Some  of  the  many  Latin  American  students 
who  had  benefited  from  the  Soviet  Union's  large  student- 
exchange  program  also  began  to  seek  new  entrepreneurial  and 
cultural  contacts  with  Russia  on  behalf  of  their  native  coun- 
tries. In  1994  Russia  cooperated  with  the  United  States  by  sup- 
porting a  United  States-led  international  intervention  force  in 
Haiti. 

In  early  1996,  Foreign  Minister  Primakov  traveled  to  Cuba 
and  other  Latin  American  states  to  indicate  Russia's  determina- 
tion to  expand  ties  in  the  region.  In  March  1996,  Russia  and 
Colombia  announced  an  agreement  on  the  supply  of  Russian 
small  arms  and  ammunition.  Seeking  to  restore  ties  with  Nica- 
ragua, Russia  agreed  in  April  1996  to  cancel  the  bulk  of  that 
nation's  debt  (US$3.4  billion)  to  the  former  Soviet  Union. 

The  Soviet-era  status  of  Cuba  deteriorated  seriously  late  in 
the  Gorbachev  regime.  Ties  between  the  communist  parties  of 
the  two  countries  were  severed,  economic  subsidies  were  sus- 
pended, and,  in  late  1991,  Gorbachev  announced  the  pullout 
of  the  Soviet  military  brigade  from  Cuba.  The  Soviet  Union 
announced  that  "mutual  benefit"  and  world  prices  would  dic- 
tate future  economic  relations  and  that  Cuba  no  longer  would 
enjoy  the  special  status  it  had  had  until  that  time.  The  end  of 
subsidies  was  a  severe  blow  to  the  Cuban  economy.  In  Novem- 


482 


Foreign  Relations 


ber  1992,  a  Russian-Cuban  trade  agreement  endeavored  to 
restore  some  trade  ties  with  a  sugar-for-oil  barter  arrangement, 
but  it  did  not  include  subsidies  for  Cuba.  During  1992  the  Rus- 
sian government  also  failed  to  defend  Cuba  against  increased 
commercial  sanctions  based  on  international  accusations  of 
human  rights  violations.  Some  Russian  hard-liners  criticized 
the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs'  treatment  of  Cuba,  and  that 
policy  was  reversed  partially  between  1993  and  1995.  First  Dep- 
uty Prime  Minister  Oleg  Soskovets  committed  Russia  to  a  credit 
of  US$350  million  and  a  sugar-for-oil  barter  agreement  in  1993, 
and  he  made  a  high-level  visit  to  strengthen  bilateral  ties  in 
1995. 

Renewed  Russian  connections  in  Cuba  have  been  of  signifi- 
cant concern  in  the  United  States.  Russia  has  argued  that  bar- 
ter arrangements  with  Cuba  do  not  violate  provisions  of  the 
United  States  trade  embargo  on  Cuba,  which  sets  severe  penal- 
ties for  United  States  trading  partners  that  deal  with  Cuba.  In 
1995  the  United  States  voiced  concern  over  Russian  plans  to 
assist  Cuba  in  completing  a  nuclear  power  reactor.  In  February 
1996,  the  United  States  tightened  economic  sanctions  against 
Cuba  in  response  to  the  shooting  down  of  two  United  States 
civilian  airplanes  in  international  airspace.  At  that  time,  Yeltsin 
criticized  the  United  States  for  overreacting,  and  he  reaffirmed 
his  intention  of  reestablishing  traditional  ties  with  Cuba. 

Foreign  Policy  Prospects 

In  the  1990s,  a  number  of  sometimes  contradictory  factors 
have  driven  Russian  foreign  policy.  The  most  formidable  and 
unchanging  factor  is  the  country's  immense  geographical  span, 
which  gives  Russia  natural  interests  in  three  vastly  different 
regions — Europe,  the  Pacific,  and  the  vast,  largely  Muslim 
stretch  of  the  Middle  East  and  Central  Asia.  Russia's  recent  his- 
tory gives  it  particular  geopolitical  motivation  to  perpetuate 
relations  with  the  fourteen  nations  that  emerged  along  its 
periphery  when  the  Soviet  Union  dissolved.  Recent  history  also 
has  motivated  efforts  to  maintain  an  influence  over  some  states 
of  the  Third  World  in  which  the  Soviet  Union  had  a  substantial 
foothold. 

The  process  of  focusing  priorities  among  a  number  of  possi- 
bilities has  proved  to  be  unusually  complex  in  an  era  when  ide- 
ology and  bilateral  rivalry  no  longer  dictate  responses.  The 
main  recurring  disagreement  in  post-Soviet  foreign  policy  pits 
advocates  of  stronger  ties  with  the  capitalist  world,  especially 


483 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Western  Europe,  against  advocates  of  some  form  of  reconsti- 
tuted union  in  which  Russia  would  be  the  dominant  force, 
politically  and  economically.  The  first  option  truly  could  take 
Russia  in  a  new  direction.  The  second  option  offers  the  security 
of  returning  to  a  familiar  role,  but  it  also  threatens  to  burden 
Russia  with  client  states  that  it  no  longer  can  afford. 

Between  1992  and  mid-1996,  the  Yeltsin  administration 
wavered  from  one  side  to  the  other,  emitting  contradictory  sig- 
nals as  it  tried  to  maintain  as  many  options  as  possible.  At  the 
same  time,  however,  Russia  moved  into  Western  organizations 
such  as  the  Council  of  Europe,  and  treaty  arrangements  such 
as  START  I,  which  gave  it  stronger  connections  with,  and  obli- 
gations to,  the  West  than  it  had  ever  had  in  the  Soviet  era.  In 
this  process,  Russia  showed  consistently  that  it  wished  to  be 
taken  seriously  as  a  diplomatic  power  upon  which  the  world 
could  rely,  not  merely  as  a  plaintiff  for  its  own  national  causes. 

Meanwhile,  in  the  mid-1990s,  increasingly  strong  political 
forces  in  Russia  have  blocked  further  movement  toward  the 
West  by  arguing  that  Russia  cannot  recapture  superpower  sta- 
tus as  a  second-rate  partner  of  rich  capitalist  states.  The  center- 
piece of  this  position  is  opposition  to  NATO  expansion 
eastward,  which  has  been  the  pretext  for  nationalists  to  block 
other  international  commitments  such  as  the  START  II  disar- 
mament agreement.  At  the  same  time,  Russia  has  maintained 
substantial  influence  in  parts  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  tak- 
ing advantage  of  destabilizing  ethnic  struggles  in  the  new 
nations  of  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia  to  play  a  dual  role  as 
peace  negotiator  and  military  guarantor  of  security.  Finally, 
Russia's  closer  ties  with  China,  a  country  that  still  is  the  object 
of  substantial  suspicion  in  the  West,  have  increasingly  alarmed 
Western  policy  makers. 

The  replacement  of  Foreign  Minister  Audrey  Kozyrev  by  Ye\- 
geniy  Primakov  in  January  1996  was  an  indication  that  Russia 
might  be  more  concerned  with  restoring  power  than  with  con- 
forming to  international  standards,  although  its  Great  Power 
infrastructure  continued  to  crumble  and  Primakov  proved  to 
be  more  pragmatic  than  dogmatic  in  his  initial  policy  state- 
ments. After  Yeltsin's  reelection  in  mid-1996,  the  president's  ill- 
ness obscured  the  locus  of  power  in  all  areas  of  governance, 
including  foreign  policy.  Western  observers  wondered  whether 
a  nation  in  acute  economic  distress,  with  a  disastrously  ineffi- 
cient military  and  few  dependable  allies  around  the  world, 
might  still  be  willing  to  make  the  sort  of  pragmatic  concessions

Chapter  9.  The  Armed  Forces 


Tsar  Saltan  approaches  three  sisters,  who  are  wistfully  talking  about  what  each

IN  THE  SOVIET  ERA,  THE  ARMED  FORCES  were  the  most 
stable  institution  in  the  nation,  exercising  strong  influence 
over  general  national  security  policy  as  well  as  over  specific 
issues  of  military  doctrine.  However,  the  last  regime  of  the 
Soviet  Union,  that  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in  office  1985-91), 
saw  unprecedented  debate  over  military  issues,  including  a 
movement  away  from  the  primarily  offensive  concerns  (which 
always  had  been  cloaked  in  declarations  of  their  necessity  for 
an  effective  national  defense)  to  a  more  defensive  position  in 
military  doctrine.  It  is  now  known  that  discussion  of  such  a 
change  began  in  the  Soviet  Union  as  early  as  the  1970s  but  only 
became  manifest  between  1987  and  1989.  Ultimately,  the 
change  was  dictated  by  policy  makers'  recognition  of  grave 
shortcomings  in  the  Soviet  Union's  political,  economic,  and 
technological  positions  versus  the  West.  After  long  discussion, 
in  1993  Russia  finally  produced  a  military  doctrine  that  nomi- 
nally reflected  the  new  military  thinking.  But  that  doctrine  was 
only  the  first  step  in  a  long  and  painful  process  of  reassessing 
the  needs  and  capabilities  of  Russia's  armed  forces  under  a 
completely  new  set  of  global  and  domestic  circumstances. 

When  the  Soviet  Union  collapsed  at  the  end  of  1991,  the 
former  Russian  Republic,  henceforth  known  as  the  Russian 
Federation,  inherited  about  85  percent  of  the  union's  overall 
military  establishment,  including  manpower,  defense  indus- 
tries, and  equipment.  However,  Russia  inherited  only  about  60 
percent  of  the  union's  economic  capacity — the  resources 
needed  for  future  support  of  that  military  machine.  Moreover, 
the  military  power  that  remained  was  a  fragmentary  mixture  of 
elements  from  the  former  Soviet  military  structure  rather  than 
an  organized  whole.  Many  of  the  priorities  in  the  Soviet 
Union's  national  security  doctrine — such  as  the  capability  to 
launch  amphibious  invasions  in  support  of  client  states  on  the 
other  side  of  the  world — had  no  logical  priority  in  the  new  Rus- 
sian state.  Requiring  substantial  reshaping  of  their  capabilities 
according  to  economic  resources,  the  Russian  armed  forces  in 
the  1990s  have  received  budget  allocations  sufficient  to  main- 
tain a  force  numbering  less  than  half  the  1.5  million  personnel 
on  duty  in  mid-1996.  Beginning  in  1994,  the  campaign  fought 
in  Chechnya  illustrated  clearly  that  Russian  forces  were  poorly 
coordinated  and  not  combat  ready.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  decline  of  the  Russian  armed  forces — and  the  shocking 
shrinkage  of  the  territory  they  had  occupied  until  the  begin- 
ning of  the  1990s — was  a  blow  to  national  pride.  Nationalist 
politicians  urged  a  new  military  buildup  that  would  return  Rus- 
sia to  the  superpower  status  of  the  Cold  War  years.  Particularly 
in  the  election  year  of  1996,  national  security  policy  became 
entwined  in  political  rhetoric,  and,  as  with  other  urgent  issues 
in  Russia,  constructive  solutions  were  delayed  until  the  nature 
of  the  next  presidential  regime  could  be  clarified.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  individual  steps  such  as  arms  agreements  and  an  appar- 
ent shift  of  strategic  emphasis  from  the  West  toward  China  con- 
tinued, but  overall  public  and  state  support  for  the  armed 
forces  languished. 

At  the  same  time,  the  Russian  military  retained  a  strong  role 
in  the  formation  of  a  new  national  foreign  policy,  especially 
policy  relating  to  the  recently  independent  former  Soviet 
states,  referred  to  in  Russia  as  the  "near  abroad."  Military  occu- 
pation under  various  guises  continued  in  the  Caucasus,  Mol- 
dova, and  Central  Asia,  as  well  as  the  separatist  Republic  of 
Chechnya,  and  in  1996  strong  nationalist  factions  exerted  pres- 
sure to  increase  the  Russian  presence  in  order  to  tighten  Rus- 
sia's links  with  the  other  former  republics  of  the  Soviet  Union. 

Historical  Background 

Modern  Russian  military  history  begins  with  Peter  the  Great, 
who  established  the  Imperial  Russian  Army  (see  Peter  the 
Great  and  the  Russian  Empire,  ch.  1).  That  force,  conceived  by 
Peter  along  the  Western  lines  that  he  had  studied,  won  its  first 
great  battle  against  the  Swedish  army  of  Charles  XII  at  Poltava 
in  1709.  The  first  great  Russian  naval  victory,  at  the  Hango  Pen- 
insula on  the  Baltic  Sea  in  1714,  also  came  at  the  expense  of 
the  Swedes;  Peter  had  modernized  the  Russian  navy  with  the 
same  diligence  he  applied  to  the  army.  The  victories  over  Swe- 
den made  Russia  the  dominant  power  in  the  Baltic  region. 

For  the  first  time,  under  Peter  the  armed  forces  were  staffed 
by  recruits  from  the  peasantry,  whose  twenty-five-year  obliga- 
tion made  them  professional  soldiers  and  sailors  devoted  to 
service  because  they  had  been  liberated  from  serfdom — 
together  with  all  their  offspring — in  the  bargain.  Officers  were 
nobles  called  to  an  equally  rigorous  lifetime  service.  Under 
Peter,  Russia  had  the  largest  standing  army  in  Europe,  and  ele- 
ments of  the  military  system  he  introduced  lasted  until  1917.

The  Armed  Forces 


Under  Catherine  II  (the  Great;  r.  1762-96),  the  Russian 
Empire  expanded  to  the  west,  the  south,  and  the  east,  and  wars 
were  fought  with  the  Ottoman  Empire  (1768-74  and  1787-92) 
and  Poland  (1794-95)  (see  Imperial  Expansion  and  Matura- 
tion: Catherine  II,  ch.  1).  The  greatest  Russian  military  leader 
of  Catherine's  time  was  Aleksandr  Suvorov,  who  fought  in  the 
second  Russo-Turkish  War  and  the  Polish  campaign,  then  led  a 
Russian  and  Austrian  army  against  the  revolutionary  French  in 
northern  Italy  in  1799.  In  the  first  decades  of  the  nineteenth 
century,  Russian  armies  continued  a  long  series  of  wars  against 
the  Ottoman  Empire.  They  also  met  Napoleon's  French  forces 
at  several  points  in  Europe;  the  most  famous  encounter  was  the 
legendary  defeat  of  Napoleon's  1812  invasion  force  by  the  Rus- 
sians under  Mikhail  Kutuzov.  That  victory  established  the  pat- 
tern of  scorched-earth  retreat  that  left  Napoleon  and 
succeeding  invaders  without  material  support,  and  it  brought  a 
Russian  army  to  Paris  in  triumphant  occupation. 

Under  Tsar  Nicholas  I  (r.  1825-  55),  Russia  became  known 
as  the  "gendarme  of  Europe,"  an  archconservative  defender  of 
monarchies  against  the  forces  of  liberation  that  had  begun  to 
sweep  Europe  in  the  previous  century.  In  1831  Nicholas 
quelled  a  Polish  rebellion  against  his  own  empire,  and  in  1849 
Russia  sent  100,000  troops  to  suppress  an  uprising  by  Hungar- 
ian patriots  against  the  Austrian  Empire.  The  Crimean  War 
(1853-56),  the  fruit  of  Europe's  complex  system  of  alliances 
and  a  series  of  diplomatic  misunderstandings,  centered  on  the 
British  and  French  siege  of  the  Russian  port  of  Sevastopol', 
which  was  well  defended  for  nearly  a  year  before  surrendering. 
However,  the  Russian  defeat  in  that  campaign  revealed  that 
Russian  command  and  supply  systems  had  fallen  behind  those 
of  Western  Europe  in  the  first  half  of  the  nineteenth  century. 

In  the  second  half  of  the  century,  Russia  waged  a  series  of 
military  campaigns  to  conquer  the  khanates  of  Central  Asia, 
extending  the  empire  and  providing  a  domestic  supply  of  cot- 
ton. With  relatively  little  military  resistance,  the  entire  region 
had  been  incorporated  into  the  empire  by  1885.  Russia's  next 
military  campaign,  however,  was  not  so  reassuring.  The  Russo- 
Japanese  War  of  1904-05  brought  stunning  defeats  on  land 
and  at  sea,  capped  by  the  naval  Battle  of  Tsushima  in  which  the 
Russian  Baltic  Fleet  was  decimated  (see  Imperialism  in  Asia 
and  the  Russo Japanese  War,  ch.  1).  Like  the  Crimean  War,  the 
Russo-Japanese  War  was  a  signal  that  Russia's  war  machine  was 
not  keeping  pace  with  the  modern  world.  Ten  years  later,

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

World  War  I  would  confirm  that  evaluation,  as  an  inept  defense 
administration  and  poorly  equipped  troops  suffered  heavy 
losses  to  the  Germans. 

Despite  those  failures,  it  was  growing  dissatisfaction  on  the 
home  front  that  ultimately  undermined  Russia's  military  effort 
in  World  War  I.  Under  the  direct  command  of  the  tsar,  the 
army  actually  performed  quite  well  in  1916,  but  by  1917  the 
war  effort  had  crippled  civilian  society  and  readied  Russia  for 
the  overthrow  of  the  tsar.  As  the  home  front  faltered  in  its 
moral  and  material  support  of  the  military,  the  results  of  1916 
were  reversed.  The  Provisional  Government  that  followed  the 
tsar  in  1917  was  determined  to  continue  the  war;  that  policy 
was  a  major  factor  in  the  success  of  the  Bolshevik  Revolution  in 
toppling  the  Provisional  Government  only  eight  months  after  it 
took  power. 

The  imperial  army  and  navy  disintegrated  after  the  Bolshe- 
vik Revolution  of  1917.  Although  the  Bolsheviks  quickly  signed 
a  peace  treaty  with  Germany,  there  was  soon  a  need  for  a  mili- 
tary force  to  defend  the  new  state  against  the  anticommunist 
Whites  in  what  became  a  bloody,  three-year  civil  war.  In  April 
1918,  the  Red  Army  was  established  when  the  Soviet  govern- 
ment announced  compulsory  military  service  for  peasants  and 
workers.  The  army's  chief  organizer  was  Leon  Trotsky,  the  new 
nation's  first  commissar  of  war  (1918-24);  Trotsky's  initial  offi- 
cer cadre  was  made  up  of  about  50,000  former  tsarist  officers. 
Trotsky  was  able  to  mold  his  peasant  and  worker  recruits  into 
an  effective  force  that  eventually  prevailed  over  five  separate 
White  armies,  with  the  benefit  of  access  to  Russia's  industrial 
heartland  and  concentrated  lines  of  supply  and  communica- 
tions. Under  Trotsky,  political  officers  were  attached  to  all  mili- 
tary units  to  ensure  the  loyalty  of  all  individuals — a  practice 
that  persisted  throughout  the  Soviet  era. 

When  the  Civil  War  ended  in  1921,  General  Mikhail  Tukha- 
chevskiy  led  an  extensive  program  of  reorganization  and  equip- 
ment modernization;  he  also  established  several  military 
schools.  In  the  first  fifteen  years  of  the  Red  Army,  communist 
party  membership  increased  rapidly  among  the  enlisted  ranks 
and,  especially,  among  the  officer  corps.  By  the  mid-1930s, 
training  schools  and  academies  had  turned  out  a  generation  of 
young  officers  and  noncommissioned  officers  with  strong  polit- 
ical indoctrination,  thus  ensuring  the  ideological  loyalty  of  the 
entire  armed  forces.  Beginning  in  1931,  Tukhachevskiy  began 
a  large-scale  rearmament  program  based  on  the  industrial 


492 


The  Armed  Forces 


development  of  the  five-year  plans  (see  Glossary),  and  the 
armed  forces  and  their  supplies  of  equipment  were  enlarged 
greatly  as  the  shadow  of  war  began  falling  over  Europe  in  the 
mid-1930s. 

In  1937  the  purges  instigated  by  Joseph  V.  Stalin  (in  office 
1927-53)  reached  the  army.  Tukhachevskiy,  now  first  deputy 
commissar  of  war,  was  executed  for  treason  together  with  seven 
top  generals.  As  many  as  30,000  other  officers  were  imprisoned 
or  dismissed,  leaving  the  Red  Army  without  experienced  com- 
manders at  the  end  of  the  1930s.  The  first  campaign  that 
revealed  this  weakness  was  the  so-called  Winter  War  against 
Finland  (1939-40),  in  which  an  estimated  100,000  troops  of 
the  Red  Army  died  while  defeating  a  small  Finnish  army. 

Although  the  Nazi  invasion  of  1941  drove  far  into  the  Rus- 
sian interior  to  threaten  Leningrad  and  Moscow,  a  new  genera- 
tion of  officers  gradually  asserted  themselves  as  the  Germans 
were  driven  from  Russian  territory  in  1943  and  1944  after  the 
climactic  Battle  of  Stalingrad.  A  crucial  event  in  that  turn- 
around was  Stalin's  removal  of  political  officers  having  parallel 
command  authority,  allowing  his  top  officers  to  exercise  mili- 
tary judgment  independent  of  ideological  concerns. 

The  most  important  Russian  military  leader  of  World  War  II 
was  Marshal  Georgiy  Zhukov,  who  was  instrumental  at  four  key 
points  of  Soviet  resistance:  the  siege  of  Leningrad;  the  defense 
of  Moscow,  the  first  point  at  which  the  German  advance  was 
stopped;  the  Battle  of  Stalingrad  (February  1943);  and  the  Bat- 
tle of  Kursk  (July  1943),  in  which  the  last  strong  German  coun- 
teroffensive  was  defeated.  Zhukov  also  commanded  the  final 
push  against  the  German  armies  across  Belorussia,  Ukraine, 
and  Poland.  In  April  1945,  Zhukov  led  the  Red  Army's  final 
assault  on  Berlin  that  ended  what  Russians  called  the  Great 
Patriotic  War. 

By  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  Soviet  armed  forces  had 
swelled  to  about  11.4  million  officers  and  soldiers,  and  the  mil- 
itary had  suffered  about  7  million  deaths.  At  that  point,  this 
force  was  recognized  as  the  most  powerful  military  in  the 
world.  In  1946  the  Red  Army  was  redesignated  as  the  Soviet 
army,  and  by  1950  demobilization  had  reduced  the  total  active 
armed  forces  to  about  3  million  troops.  From  the  late  1940s  to 
the  late  1960s,  the  Soviet  armed  forces  focused  on  adapting  to 
the  changed  nature  of  warfare  in  the  era  of  nuclear  arms  and 
on  achieving  parity  with  the  United  States  in  strategic  nuclear 
weapons.  Conventional  military  power  showed  its  continued 


493 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

importance,  however,  when  the  Soviet  Union  used  its  troops  to 
invade  Hungary  in  1956  and  Czechoslovakia  in  1968  to  keep 
those  countries  within  the  Soviet  alliance  system. 

In  the  1970s,  the  Soviet  Union  began  to  modernize  its  con- 
ventional warfare  and  power  projection  capabilities.  At  the 
same  time,  it  became  more  involved  than  ever  before  in 
regional  conflicts  and  local  wars.  The  Soviet  Union  sent  arms 
and  military  advisers  to  a  variety  of  Third  World  allies  in  Africa, 
Asia,  and  the  Middle  East.  Soviet  generals  planned  military 
operations  against  rebels  in  Angola  and  Ethiopia.  However, 
Soviet  troops  saw  little  combat  in  such  assignments  until  the 
invasion  of  Afghanistan  in  December  1979.  There,  they  fought 
a  counterinsurgency  campaign  against  Afghan  rebels  for  nearly 
eight  and  one-half  years.  An  estimated  15,000  Soviet  soldiers 
had  been  killed  and  35,000  wounded  in  the  conflict  by  the  time 
Soviet  forces  began  to  withdraw  from  Afghanistan  in  May  1988. 
By  early  1989,  all  of  the  roughly  110,000  Soviet  troops  who  had 
been  deployed  had  left  Afghanistan. 

After  incurring  the  heavy  blow  of  failure  in  the  Afghanistan 
campaign,  the  Soviet  armed  forces  faced  an  even  larger,  albeit 
nonviolent  setback  as  the  Soviet  sphere  of  influence  in  Europe 
began  to  crumble  in  1989.  It  disappeared  entirely  by  1991, 
when  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary)  alliance  dissolved.  As  a 
result,  by  1994  all  Soviet/Russian  troops  had  been  withdrawn 
from  territory  west  of  Ukraine  and  Belarus,  as  well  as  from  the 
three  Baltic  states,  which  achieved  independence  in  1991. 
Together  with  the  end  of  the  Soviet  Union  as  a  state,  the  events 
of  that  period  set  the  military  on  a  bewildering  search  for  a  new 
identity  and  a  new  doctrine. 

Military  Doctrine 

In  Russia  military  doctrine  is  the  official  formulation  of  con- 
cepts on  the  nature  of  present  and  future  war  and  the  nation's 
potential  role,  given  existing  or  anticipated  geopolitical  condi- 
tions. In  the  late  1980s,  the  military  doctrine  of  the  Soviet 
Union  underwent  a  dramatic  change  toward  defensive  readi- 
ness before  the  dissolution  of  the  union.  After  inheriting  the 
unfinished  transition  of  that  period,  Russia  struggled  to 
develop  a  suitable  new  set  of  concepts  in  the  1990s.  The  first 
step,  the  doctrine  of  1993,  was  considered  a  temporary  docu- 
ment leading  to  a  full  statement  of  goals  and  circumstances  to 
be  formulated  around  2000.

Soviet  Doctrine 

The  Soviet  Union's  first  military  doctrine  was  based  on  the 
teachings  of  Vladimir  I.  Lenin  about  defense  of  the  socialist 
homeland  and  on  the  military  theories  of  Civil  War  general 
Mikhail  Frunze.  Starting  in  the  early  1920s,  doctrine  under- 
went a  series  of  changes  in  response  to  geopolitical  and  eco- 
nomic conditions.  After  World  War  II,  Stalin  introduced  the 
concept  of  two  mutually  irreconcilable  international  coali- 
tions— the  capitalist  and  the  socialist — that  inevitably  would 
come  into  armed  conflict.  In  the  1950s,  the  Soviet  acquisition 
of  nuclear  weapons  added  a  new  dimension  to  Stalin's  postwar 
concept  of  a  massive,  combined-arms  struggle  on  the  fields  of 
Europe.  Soviet  leader  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  (in  office  1953-64) 
saw  adequate  nuclear  deterrence  as  a  guarantee  that  socialism 
would  be  able  to  advance  in  peace  toward  its  inevitable  tri- 
umph. Based  on  that  theory,  he  shifted  support  from  conven- 
tional forces  to  a  new  military  group,  the  nuclear-armed 
strategic  rocket  forces.  However,  in  this  period  the  Soviet  mili- 
tary establishment  argued  for  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons  in 
fighting,  rather  than  preventing,  a  war — including  the  initia- 
tion of  nuclear  attack.  In  the  1960s,  that  idea  was  refined  with 
the  addition  of  small-scale  nuclear  strikes  and  a  renewed 


495

emphasis  on  conventional  warfare.  By  1970  the  doctrine  envi- 
sioned two  major  possibilities:  an  entirely  conventional  war  or  a 
nuclear  war  fought  between  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United 
States  solely  in  Western  and  Central  Europe. 

In  the  1970s  and  the  1980s,  military  thinkers  continued  to 
question  the  military  efficacy  of  nuclear  weapons,  although 
official  doctrine  assumed  that  the  Soviet  Union  could  win  a 
nuclear  war.  In  this  period,  the  concept  of  a  nonnuclear,  high- 
technology  global  war,  advanced  by  Chief  of  the  General  Staff 
Marshal  Nikolay  Ogarkov,  attracted  substantial  support.  By  the 
late  1980s,  military  doctrine  had  begun  to  evolve  toward  a 
defensive  concept  of  "reasonable  sufficiency"  of  military  force 
to  ensure  national  security  but  not  to  initiate  offensive  opera- 
tions. At  the  behest  of  the  Soviet  Union,  in  1987  the  Warsaw 
Pact  officially  adopted  a  defense-oriented  military  doctrine  and 
called  for  reductions  in  conventional  arms  in  Europe. 

The  Doctrine  of  1 993 

Although  it  is  verbose  and  highly  theoretical,  the  1993  mili- 
tary doctrine  contains  important  indicators  of  policy  under  var- 
ious scenarios.  It  is  the  statement  of  the  military  policy  of  the 
Russian  government,  arrived  at  after  long  and  intense  debate 
among  all  interested  parties,  whose  input  reflects  their  relative 
political  power.  Russian  military  doctrine  is  roughly  the  equiva- 
lent of  a  formal  statement  of  the  military  policy  of  a  presiden- 
tial administration  in  the  United  States. 

The  official  Russian  definition  of  military  doctrine  is  "a 
nation's  officially  accepted  system  of  scientifically  founded 
views  on  the  nature  of  modern  wars  and  the  use  of  armed 
forces  in  them,  and  also  on  the  requirement  arising  from  these 
views  regarding  the  country  and  its  armed  forces  being  made 
ready  for  war."  Military  doctrine  answers  these  five  basic  ques- 
tions for  the  Russian  armed  forces:  Who  is  the  enemy  in  a  prob- 
able war?  What  is  the  probable  character  of  a  war,  and  what  will 
be  its  aims  and  tasks?  What  forces  will  be  necessary  to  fulfill 
these  tasks,  and  what  direction  will  military  development  fol- 
low? How  should  preparation  for  war  be  carried  out?  What  will 
be  the  means  of  warfare? 

The  demise  of  the  Soviet  Union  made  the  formulation  of  a 
new  military  doctrine  to  replace  that  of  the  Gorbachev  regime 
an  obvious  necessity.  However,  urgent  political  questions 
delayed  the  onset  of  deliberation  on  a  new  doctrine  until  May 
1992.  From  that  time,  completion  of  the  doctrine  required  sev-

enteen  months,  much  of  which  was  filled  with  acrimonious 
debate.  In  November  1993,  the  final  version  was  approved  by 
the  Russian  Federation's  Security  Council  and  signed  by  Presi- 
dent Boris  N.  Yeltsin  as  Decree  Number  1833  (see  The  Security 
Council,  ch.  8). 

Although  the  full  doctrine  text  had  not  been  published  as  of 
mid-1996,  detailed  accounts  have  been  released  to  the  public. 
According  to  these  summaries,  the  document  includes  three 
main  sections,  entitled  political  principles,  military  principles, 
and  military-technical  and  economic  principles. 

The  introduction  to  the  1993  military  doctrine  defines  the 
document  as  an  interim  policy  covering  the  period  of  transi- 
tion from  the  Soviet  Union  to  the  establishment  of  Russian 
statehood  and  the  emergence  of  a  new  form  of  international 
relations.  The  interim  period  is  defined  as  continuing  from  the 
time  of  adoption  to  2000. 

From  1993  until  1996,  the  primary  goal  was  to  restructure 
and  reduce  the  armed  forces  as  units  were  withdrawn  from 
locations  outside  Russia.  The  remaining  four  years  would  be 
devoted  to  conversion  from  a  purely  conscript  personnel  base 
to  a  mixed  (conscript  and  voluntary)  system,  together  with  the 
creation  of  a  new  military  infrastructure. 

Political  Principles 

The  first  main  section  of  the  doctrine  describes  the  Russian 
Federation's  attitude  toward  armed  conflicts,  and  how  the 
armed  forces  and  security  troops  are  to  be  used  in  them.  It 
defines  what  the  Russian  Federation  perceives  as  the  military 
danger  to  it,  the  sociopolitical  principles  supporting  military 
security,  and  national  policy  for  ensuring  military  security.  The 
underlying  goal  of  the  principles  is  to  maintain  domestic  and 
international  political  stability  on  the  borders  while  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  is  consolidating  itself.  In  describing  this  goal, 
the  doctrine  makes  no  reference  to  defending  an  ideology  or 
the  gains  of  previous  years,  as  was  standard  practice  in  all  Soviet 
military  doctrines. 

Peace  on  the  borders,  especially  in  and  among  the  newly 
independent  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  is  part  of 
the  defensive  strategy.  The  only  departure  from  this  self-inter- 
ested approach  is  a  stated  willingness  to  participate  in  interna- 
tional peacekeeping  efforts.  In  1996  Russian  participation  in 
the  Bosnian  Peace  Implementation  Force  (IFOR)  was  justified 
by  this  clause  in  the  military  doctrine. 


497 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  military  doctrine  retains  no  vestige  of  the  international 
activism  that  pervaded  its  Marxist-Leninist  (see  Glossary)  ante- 
cedents. Resolution  of  internal  Russian  economic,  political, 
and  social  problems  is  the  principal  order  of  business.  The  only 
formal  international  obligations  that  are  recognized  are  formal 
treaty  obligations  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States 
(CIS — see  Glossary);  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Coopera- 
tion in  Europe  (CSCE),  since  1995  known  as  the  Organization 
for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE — see  Glos- 
sary); and  those  resulting  from  membership  in  the  United 
Nations  (UN).  The  document  does  not  refer  to  the  Conven- 
tional Forces  in  Europe  Treaty  (CFE  Treaty — see  Glossary), 
which  in  the  1990s  is  a  key  constraint  on  Russia's  deployment  of 
military  forces  in  certain  areas. 

The  paramount  goal  of  this  interim  doctrine  is  to  protect 
Russia  from  attack  in  the  weakened  condition  in  which  it  has 
found  itself  in  the  1990s.  The  principal  threats  to  the  Russian 
Federation  are  defined  as  wars  and  armed  conflicts  on  the  Rus- 
sian borders,  the  potential  employment  of  weapons  of  mass 
destruction  against  the  Russian  Federation  or  on  its  borders, 
the  buildup  of  armed  forces  along  Russian  borders,  or  physical 
attacks  on  Russian  installations  or  territories.  The  term  "instal- 
lations" refers  to  Soviet-era  bases  in  the  newly  independent 
former  Soviet  republics  that  continue  to  be  garrisoned  by  Rus- 
sian troops.  (The  last  Russian  troops  in  Central  Europe  left 
Germany  in  August  1994.) 

Military  Principles 

The  interim  Russian  military  doctrine  sets  the  primary 
objective  for  the  armed  forces  as  the  prevention,  early  termina- 
tion, and  containment  of  military  conflict  through  employ- 
ment of  peacetime  standing  forces.  The  principal  areas  of 
concern  are  the  territory  and  property  of  the  Russian  Federa- 
tion, the  areas  contiguous  to  its  borders,  and  the  threat  of 
nuclear  attack  by  a  foreign  power. 

Military  operations  in  Chechnya  are  justified  under  the  para- 
graph on  protection  of  the  territory  and  property  of  the  Rus- 
sian Federation.  Justification  for  a  continued  Russian  military 
presence  in  the  former  Central  Asian  republics  derives  from 
the  paragraph  on  protection  of  areas  contiguous  to  Russian 
borders,  as  well  as  provisions  of  the  CIS  treaty  (see  The  Geopo- 
litical Context,  this  ch.).

The  Armed  Forces 


Russia  reserves  the  right  of  first  use  of  weapons  of  mass 
destruction,  which  remain  a  primary  concern  of  policy  makers 
in  the  age  of  nuclear  disarmament.  This  reservation,  which  is 
in  apparent  violation  of  the  terms  of  the  Nuclear  Nonprolifera- 
tion  Treaty  (NPT — see  Glossary),  has  been  retained  neverthe- 
less in  response  to  Russia's  uncertainty  as  to  the  intentions  of 
the  three  neighboring  states — Belarus,  Kazakstan,  and 
Ukraine — that  were  left  with  nuclear  weapons  after  the  dissolu- 
tion of  the  Soviet  Union.  However,  the  last  nuclear  weapons  in 
Kazakstan  were  destroyed  in  1995,  the  last  nuclear  weapons  left 
Ukraine  in  mid-1996,  and  the  last  nuclear  weapons  were  sched- 
uled to  leave  Belarus  by  the  end  of  1996 — seemingly  eliminat- 
ing this  rationale.  Suspicion  of  the  nuclear  intentions  of  the 
United  States  and  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization 
(NATO — see  Glossary)  is  the  remaining  foundation  for  the 
first-use  provision  of  the  doctrine. 

Military-Technical  and  Economic  Principles 

The  military  doctrine's  treatment  of  the  military-technical 
and  economic  foundations  of  the  armed  forces — the  process  of 
providing  and  maintaining  modern  military  hardware — is  the 
aspect  that  shows  the  greatest  gap  between  policy  and  reality. 
The  doctrine  describes  a  policy  of  preserving  a  military-indus- 
trial base  capable  of  manufacturing  modern  military  equip- 
ment in  quantity.  It  also  describes  a  ten-  to  fifteen-year 
research,  development,  testing,  and  evaluation  cycle  for  new 
weapons.  In  the  mid-1990s,  only  a  very  fragmentary  commit- 
ment to  those  goals  was  visible  in  Russia's  assignment  of  spend- 
ing priorities  (see  Structure  and  Conditions,  this  ch.).  At  the 
very  least,  defense  policy  has  delayed  until  after  the  turn  of  the 
century  a  large  share  of  the  acquisition  costs  and  demands  on 
the  national  industrial  base  that  such  a  commitment  would 
involve.  At  that  point,  a  new  military  doctrine  probably  will 
address  the  issue  of  technological  and  economic  support. 

The  Doctrine  of  the  Future 

The  concluding  section  of  the  military  doctrine  contains  an 
assurance  of  the  defensive  and  peaceful  intentions  of  the  Rus- 
sian Federation  and  of  its  intention  to  adhere  strictly  to  the  UN 
Charter  and  the  tenets  of  international  law.  However,  the  con- 
clusion also  states  that  this  document  will  be  supplemented, 
adjusted,  and  improved  as  Russian  statehood  is  established  and 
as  a  new  system  of  international  relations  is  formed. 


499 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Assumedly,  the  nature  of  such  changes  would  depend  on 
Russia's  success  in  achieving  another  primary  goal:  preserving 
the  basis  of  military  power  inherited  from  the  Soviet  Union 
and  setting  the  stage  for  making  the  Russian  Federation  a 
major  military  power  after  the  turn  of  the  century.  The  view  of 
the  future  contained  in  the  doctrine  is  projected  against  spe- 
cific time  lines.  The  new  Russian  armed  forces  and  the  basis  for 
their  military  power  are  projected  to  be  in  place  by  2000,  when 
a  new,  and  presumably  more  assertive,  military  doctrine  is 
promised.  Serious  consideration  of  the  content  of  a  more  per- 
manent doctrine  was  not  expected  to  begin  until  a  new  govern- 
ment was  in  place  after  the  1996  presidential  election. 

Meanwhile,  early  in  1996  the  government-supported  Insti- 
tute for  Defense  Studies  produced  a  set  of  "conceptual  theses" 
on  Russia's  national  security  against  external  threats.  Although 
not  a  formal  outline  for  a  new  military  doctrine,  experts  saw 
the  theses  as  an  important  indication  of  current  military 
thought. 

The  1996  report  lists  four  major  threats  to  Russia's  national 
security:  interference  in  its  internal  affairs  by  the  United  States 
and  its  allies;  political  and  economic  penetration  of  Azerbaijan 
by  Turkey  and  its  Western  allies;  expansion  of  NATO  into  Cen- 
tral Europe,  the  Baltic  states,  and  ultimately  Ukraine;  and  uni- 
lateral disarmament  of  Russia  through  forced  treaties, 
modification  of  the  existing  Anti-Ballistic  Missile  Treaty  (ABM 
Treaty — see  Glossary),  degradation  of  existing  Russian  strate- 
gic weapons  systems  and  research  and  development  centers,  or 
obstructions  to  the  integration  of  the  CIS. 

Among  "recommended  strategies"  to  neutralize  such  threats, 
the  report  lists  refusing  to  work  with  the  International  Mone- 
tary Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  and  the  World  Bank  (see  Glos- 
sary), preventing  Western  access  to  Caspian  Sea  oil, 
establishing  a  military  alliance  of  CIS  members  to  block  NATO 
expansion  (and  invading  the  Baltic  states  if  they  try  to  join 
NATO),  and  deploying  tactical  nuclear  weapons  in  the  Cauca- 
sus, Baltic,  or  Far  North  regions.  The  report  also  recommends 
enlarging  Russia's  stockpile  of  strategic  nuclear  weapons  when 
the  limits  of  phase  one  of  the  Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty 
(START — see  Glossary)  end  in  2009.  The  particular  concern 
with  NATO  expansion  drives  several  of  these  proposals,  and 
comments  made  in  1996  by  top  military  officials  confirm  that  a 
set  of  active  responses  has  been  prepared  for  such  an  eventual- 
ity (see  The  NATO  Issue,  this  ch.).  However,  experts  see  both 


500 


The  Armed  Forces 


the  Institute  for  Defense  Studies  report  and  supporting  state- 
ments by  military  authorities  as  part  of  a  pattern  of  pressure 
applied  to  potential  new  NATO  states  to  discourage  them  from 
pursuing  membership. 

In  June  1996,  the  office  of  the  president's  national  security 
adviser,  Yuriy  Baturin,  released  a  draft  statement  on  national 
security  policy  goals  for  the  period  1996-2000  that  indicated  a 
less  aggressive  approach  to  the  next  military  doctrine.  The  doc- 
ument's authors  recognized  that  Russia  faces  no  external 
threat,  stressing  instead  that  Russia's  chief  national  security 
need  is  to  strengthen  the  Russian  state  economically  and  politi- 
cally rather  than  to  maintain  military  parity  with  the  West. 
Because  the  United  States  no  longer  is  interested  in  manipulat- 
ing European  geopolitics,  according  to  the  document,  it  is  now 
safe  to  make  concessions — including  arms  reduction  treaties — 
in  the  search  for  balanced  and  cooperative  relations  (see  The 
United  States,  ch.  8).  The  NATO  expansion  issue  was  recog- 
nized as  the  chief  obstacle  to  achieving  such  relations  in  1996. 
Although  the  draft  policy  statement  was  generally  pro-Western, 
it  assigned  the  highest  value  to  relations  with  the  CIS  rather 
than  the  West.  Experts  saw  the  draft  as  an  attempt  to  counter 
the  nationalist  faction  that  continues  to  emphasize  military 
power  as  the  most  important  element  of  national  security  and 
whose  position  was  forcefully  stated  in  the  report  of  the  Insti- 
tute for  Defense  Studies. 

The  Geopolitical  Context 

According  to  the  Ministry  of  Defense,  between  1991  and 
1995  the  Soviet  Union  and  then  Russia  withdrew  about  730,000 
troops  from  eleven  countries:  Azerbaijan,  Cuba,  the  Czech 
Republic,  Estonia,  Germany,  Hungary,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Mon- 
golia, Poland,  and  Slovakia.  Including  military  families,  about 
1.2  million  people  were  involved  in  this  shift.  Besides  the 
troops,  all  the  paraphernalia  of  fifteen  army  directorates,  forty- 
nine  combined-arms  divisions,  seventy  brigades,  seventy-two 
aviation  regiments,  and  twenty-four  helicopter  regiments  also 
were  moved  from  foreign  posts. 

The  unprecedented  speed  with  which  Russia's  direct  military 
influence  shrank  had  a  strong  effect  on  the  national  psyche. 
Beginning  in  1993,  Russia's  foreign  policy  increasingly 
reflected  the  views  of  influential  nationalist  and  communist 
elements  of  the  government.  Those  elements  sought  political 
support  by  reviving  the  memories  of  Soviet  world  power,  prom- 


501 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

ising  an  end  to  the  "subservient"  role  being  played  by  Russia  on 
the  world  political  stage  of  the  1990s.  Inevitably,  Russia's  real- 
world  application  of  its  military  doctrine  is  an  implicit  and 
explicit  element  in  expanding  influence  in  the  directions  dic- 
tated by  a  revised  foreign  policy  program.  (The  1996  Institute 
for  Defense  Studies  report  indicates  that  viewpoint.)  Given 
severe  funding  limitations,  however,  that  expansion  seemed  to 
have  limited  possibilities  in  mid-1996. 

Chechnya 

The  Republic  of  Chechnya,  located  on  the  north  slope  of 
the  Caucasus  Mountains  within  100  kilometers  of  the  Caspian 
Sea,  is  strategically  vital  to  Russia  for  two  reasons.  First,  access 
routes  to  both  the  Black  Sea  and  the  Caspian  Sea  go  from  the 
center  of  the  federation  through  Chechnya.  Second,  vital  Rus- 
sian oil  and  gas  pipeline  connections  with  Kazakstan  and  Azer- 
baijan also  run  through  Chechnya.  The  declaration  of  full 
independence  issued  in  1993  by  the  Chechen  government  of 
Dzhokar  Dudayev  led  to  civil  war  in  that  republic,  and  several 
Russian-backed  attempts  to  overthrow  Dudayev  failed  in  1993 
and  1994.  After  a  decision  of  unclear  origin  in  the  Yeltsin 
administration,  three  divisions  of  Russian  armor,  pro-Russian 
Chechen  infantry,  and  internal  security  troops — a  force  includ- 
ing units  detailed  from  the  regular  armed  forces — invaded 
Chechnya  in  December  1994.  The  objective  was  a  quick  victory 
leading  to  pacification  and  reestablishment  of  a  pro-Russian 
government.  The  result,  however,  was  a  long  series  of  military 
operations  bungled  by  the  Russians  and  stymied  by  the  tradi- 
tionally rugged  guerrilla  forces  of  the  Chechen  separatists. 
Although  Russian  forces  leveled  the  Chechen  capital  city  of 
Groznyy  and  other  population  centers  during  a  long  and 
bloody  campaign  of  urban  warfare,  Chechen  forces  held  exten- 
sive territory  elsewhere  in  the  republic  through  1995  and  into 
1996.  Two  major  hostage-taking  incidents — one  at  Budennovsk 
in  southern  Russia  in  June  1995  and  one  at  the  Dagestani  bor- 
der town  of  Pervomayskoye  in  January  1996 — led  to  the  embar- 
rassment of  unsuccessful  military  missions  to  release  the 
prisoners.  The  Pervomayskoye  incident  led  to  the  complete 
destruction  of  the  town  and  numerous  civilian  casualties. 

As  the  campaign's  failures  and  substantial  casualties  were 
being  well  documented  by  Russia's  independent  news  media 
(an  estimated  1,500  Russian  troops  and  25,000  civilians  had 
died  by  April  1995,  and  the  total  killed  was  estimated  as  high  as 


502 


The  Armed  Forces 


40,000  one  year  later),  public  opinion  in  Russia  turned  strongly 
against  continued  occupation.  However,  fearing  that  capitula- 
tion to  a  separatist  government  in  one  ethnic  republic  would 
set  a  precedent  for  other  independence-minded  regions,  in 
1995  President  Yeltsin  wavered  between  full  support  of  Chech- 
nya operations  and  condemnation  of  the  supposed  incompe- 
tence of  Defense  Minister  Pavel  Grachev  and  his  generals  (see 
Movements  Toward  Sovereignty,  ch.  4) .  Yeltsin  fired  several  top 
generals,  including  Deputy  Minister  of  Defense  Boris  Gromov, 
who  were  critical  of  the  war. 

In  1995  and  early  1996,  Chechen  forces  fought  from  moun- 
tain enclaves,  into  which  they  had  been  driven  by  Russian 
forces  with  superior  firepower  and  air  support.  The  Chechens 
used  various  opportunities  to  attack  targets  outside  their 
enclaves,  including  the  Budennovsk  raid  of  June  1995.  On  sev- 
eral occasions,  Russian  forces  continued  bombardments  of 
Chechen  strongholds  after  Yeltsin  had  announced  a  cease-fire. 
In  May  1996,  Chechen  leader  Zelimkhan  Yandarbiyev  signed  a 
cease-fire  with  Yeltsin  in  Moscow,  followed  by  full  armistice  pro- 
tocols negotiated  by  the  OSCE  in  the  Ingush  city  of  Nazran. 
The  protocols  set  August  30  for  withdrawal  of  "temporary"  Rus- 
sian forces  (plans  already  existed  for  permanent  stationing  of 
two  brigades),  contingent  on  parallel  disarmament  of  Chechen 
forces.  At  the  end  of  June,  Russian  forces  began  a  partial  with- 
drawal, but  fighting  continued  in  some  regions,  and  negotia- 
tions stalled  amid  mutual  recriminations.  In  July  Russian  forces 
began  a  new  assault  on  villages  described  as  harboring  guerrilla 
forces,  and  Russia  again  seemed  to  lack  a  unified  policy  toward 
Chechnya. 

Russian  military  and  political  actions  immediately  before 
and  after  the  protocols  indicated  little  respect  for  their  terms. 
The  Russian-supported  regime  in  Groznyy  signed  a  draft  politi- 
cal status  on  Chechnya  without  consulting  the  rebels,  and  the 
Russian  Ministry  of  Defense  reaffirmed  its  plan  to  keep  troops 
in  Chechnya  indefinitely.  Those  circumstances  indicated 
strongly  that  peace  negotiations  were  a  short-term  strategy  to 
reduce  the  Chechnya  obstacle  to  Yeltsin's  reelection  in  the 
summer  of  1996. 

Because  of  the  poor  performance  of  regular  troops  in 
Chechnya,  Russia  had  been  forced  to  use  elite  naval  infantry 
and  airborne  assault  units — the  former  gathered  from  fifty 
units  of  the  Baltic  Fleet  and  more  than  100  ships  or  units  of  the 


503 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Pacific  Fleet.  Airborne  units  from  two  divisions  were  used  to 
end  the  Pervomayskoye  hostage  crisis  in  January  1996. 

According  to  Russian  and  Western  experts,  the  many  serious 
command  errors  made  in  the  Chechnya  campaign  were  at  least 
partly  the  result  of  a  fragmented  command  system  in  which  the 
lack  of  direct  coordination  deprived  commanders  of  the  ability 
to  make  timely  decisions.  A  major  cause  of  this  problem  was 
the  lack  of  field  training  among  all  levels  of  the  officer  corps 
(see  Training,  this  ch.). 

The  Chechnya  crisis  was  the  most  visible  indication  of  the 
division  in  Russia's  government  over  the  application  of  military 
doctrine,  and  of  a  disintegration  process  that  even  Boris  Yeltsin 
had  recognized  in  1994.  With  numerous  declarations  of  sover- 
eignty having  emerged  from  ethnic  republics  and  regions  in 
1991  and  1992,  the  1993  military  doctrine  had  stipulated  that 
the  military  could  be  used  against  separatist  groups  within  the 
federation,  providing  a  theoretical  justification  for  the  Chech- 
nya action.  Many  military  authorities  argued  that  such  a  cam- 
paign was  foolhardy,  given  military  budget  cuts  that  made 
proper  training  and  equipping  of  troops  impossible.  Neverthe- 
less, the  "war  party"  of  officials  and  advisers  surrounding  Yeltsin 
failed  to  foresee  the  media  storm  that  resulted  from  a  bloody 
military  struggle  within  the  federation.  In  1995  and  early  1996, 
Grachev's  inability  to  obtain  a  favorable  outcome  and  contin- 
ued disarray  in  top  command  echelons  indicated  that  he  had 
lost  control  of  the  military  establishment. 

The  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States 

In  the  mid-1990s,  an  increasingly  prominent  component  of 
Russian  foreign  policy  was  recovery  of  military  and  economic 
influence  in  as  many  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States 
(CIS)  nations  as  possible.  Along  Russia's  southern  borders, 
postindependence  instability  offered  a  series  of  opportunities 
to  retain  a  military  presence  in  the  name  of  "peacekeeping" 
among  warring  factions  or  nations,  some  of  whose  hostility 
could  be  traced  back  to  actions  taken  by  Russian  forces.  Varia- 
tions of  this  theme  occurred  in  Georgia,  Armenia,  Azerbaijan, 
Moldova,  and  Tajikistan. 

Georgia 

The  course  of  events  along  Russia's  southwestern  frontiers 
has  given  Georgia  increased  military  significance  since  1991.  A 
critical  event  was  Russia's  recognition  of  Ukrainian  sovereignty

in  Crimea,  formerly  Russia's  only  basing  area  for  its  Black  Sea 
Fleet.  The  drive  of  the  Abkhazian  Autonomous  Republic  for 
independence  from  Georgia  provided  Russia  with  an  opportu- 
nity to  bargain  for  access  to  Black  Sea  ports  in  Georgia.  Report- 
edly organized  by  Russian  intelligence  agencies  and  heavily 
supported  by  Moscow,  a  mercenary  force  of  North  Caucasus 
Muslim  troops  threatened  to  occupy  large  portions  of  Georgia 
in  the  early  fall  of  1993.  At  this  desperate  point,  the  Georgian 
government  offered  Russia  extended  basing  privileges  in 
return  for  the  protection  of  Russian  "peacekeeping"  forces. 
Ironically,  the  Russian-supported  mercenaries  fighting  for 
Abkhazia  formed  the  Confederation  of  Mountain  Peoples  of 
the  North  Caucasus,  which  declared  its  intention  of  destabiliz- 
ing Russia's  Muslim  North  Caucasus  republics.  Therefore,  con- 
tinued access  to  Georgian  territory  acquired  the  additional 
purpose  of  encircling  potentially  separatist  enclaves — which  is 
exactly  what  Russia  did  in  1994  in  preparing  to  enter  Chech- 
nya. 

The  1995  basing  agreement  that  resulted  from  the  Georgian 
capitulation  of  1993  permits  the  presence  of  three  Russian 
bases — in  Tbilisi,  Poti,  and  Batumi — with  tanks,  armored  per- 
sonnel carriers,  and  heavy  artillery.  However,  other  Russian 
forces  in  Georgia  also  were  identified  in  1995  after  they  took 
part  in  bombardments  in  Chechnya.  The  troops  in  Georgia, 
designated  strictly  for  control  of  domestic  conflicts  such  as  the 
one  in  Chechnya,  also  constitute  a  violation  of  the  CFE  Treaty, 
to  which  Russia  has  sought  a  special  adjustment. 

In  mid-1996  there  were  an  estimated  1,700  Russian  troops 
on  peacekeeping  duty  between  Georgian  and  Abkhazian  lines 
in  northwestern  Georgia,  including  one  airborne  regiment 
and  two  motorized  rifle  battalions.  The  three  main  Russian 
bases  housed  about  8,500  troops  with  110  main  battle  tanks, 
510  armored  combat  vehicles,  and  238  artillery  pieces. 

Armenia 

Armenia's  continued  desperate  position,  locked  between 
Muslim  states  Azerbaijan,  Iran,  and  Turkey  and  still  reeling 
from  the  long  blockade  inflicted  by  Azerbaijan  and  Turkey  in 
the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict,  provides  ample  justification 
for  heavy  reliance  on  Russia  for  national  security.  For  Russia, 
Armenia's  position  on  the  eastern  border  of  Turkey  is  a  prime 
location  for  preventing  Russia's  traditional  enemy  from 
expanding  its  influence  to  the  north  and  east.  A  new  unified

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

CIS  defense  system  being  created  by  Russian  military  planners 
in  1996  has  included  the  long-term  basing  of  Russian  troops  on 
Armenian  soil  and  joint  Armenian-Russian  exercises  on  Arme- 
nian territory.  Russia  has  lent  substantial  nonmilitary  aid  to 
Armenia  in  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict,  but  Russia  does 
not  see  supporting  a  complete  victory  by  Armenia  over  Azer- 
baijan as  strategically  advantageous.  In  mid-1996  Russia  had  an 
estimated  4,300  troops  at  a  single  base  in  Armenia,  with  eighty 
main  battle  tanks,  190  armored  personnel  carriers,  and  100 
artillery  pieces.  Russian  border  troops  also  assisted  in  patrol- 
ling Armenia's  border  with  Turkey. 

Azerbaijan 

Azerbaijan,  whose  location  adjacent  to  the  rich  oil  resources 
of  the  Caspian  Sea  makes  it  strategically  more  vital  to  Russia 
than  Armenia,  is  the  only  one  of  the  three  Caucasus  states  to 
refuse  any  deployment  of  Russian  troops  on  its  soil.  Russia  fears 
the  increasing  influence  of  Turkey  in  Azerbaijan,  which, 
according  to  national  security  planners,  is  a  likely  bridge  for 
Turkish  influence  into  Central  Asia  and  Russia's  Muslim  repub- 
lics to  the  north  and  east  of  Azerbaijan.  Because  of  these  fac- 
tors, Russia  has  exerted  substantial  diplomatic  and  economic 
pressure  on  Azerbaijan  to  reappraise  its  independent  policy. 
However,  former  Soviet  Politburo  member  Heydar  Aliyev,  now 
president  of  Azerbaijan,  has  proven  much  more  independent 
than  Russia  expected  when  it  assisted  him  in  becoming  head  of 
state  in  1993. 

Moldova 

The  Russian  (formerly  Soviet)  14th  Army  has  been  based  on 
Moldovan  (formerly  Moldavian)  territory  since  1956.  In  Sep- 
tember 1990,  Slavs  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Nistru  (Dnestr) 
River  in  the  Moldavian  Republic  declared  an  independent 
Dnestr  Moldavian  Republic,  or  Transnistria.  After  armed  con- 
flict began  between  forces  of  the  new  republic  and  Moldovan 
troops  in  the  spring  of  1992,  part  of  the  14th  Army  became  a 
peacekeeping  force  following  an  agreement  between  Russia 
and  the  government  of  newly  independent  Moldova.  The  origi- 
nal Russian  force  included  six  battalions  (2,400  troops),  which 
occupied  a  security  zone  together  with  troops  of  Moldova  and 
Transnistria.  Subsequently,  Transnistrian  units  began  replacing 
units  of  the  14th  Army,  taking  advantage  of  what  observers 
called  a  decided  bias  by  the  army  in  favor  of  its  fellow  Slavs. 


506 


The  Armed  Forces 


By  the  end  of  1994,  about  3,500  Transnistrian  troops  were  in 
the  security  zone  with  the  tacit  approval  of  the  Russian  forces, 
enabling  the  separatists  to  consolidate  their  state.  At  the  same 
time,  Russia  violated  the  agreement  with  Moldova  by  withdraw- 
ing all  but  630  of  its  peacekeepers,  citing  the  Russian  military's 
funding  problems.  However,  in  1996  the  bulk  of  the  14th  Army 
remained  in  Moldova,  subject  to  the  outcome  of  long-inconclu- 
sive negotiations,  under  the  title  Operational  Group  of  Russian 
Forces  in  Moldova.  (A  bilateral  1994  agreement  to  withdraw 
the  14th  Army  entirely  never  was  ratified  by  the  State  Duma, 
the  lower  house  of  Russia's  parliament.)  In  mid-1996  some 
6,400  Russian  troops  of  the  14th  Army  and  two  "peacekeeping" 
battalions  remained.  Russia  has  opposed  participation  by  the 
OSCE  in  the  withdrawal  negotiations.  Some  experts  have 
described  Moldova  as  a  potential  staging  point  for  Russian 
operations  in  Central  Europe. 

In  1994  Moldova  also  was  the  scene  of  a  divisive  struggle  in 
the  military  command.  In  midyear  Minister  of  Defense 
Grachev  attempted  to  remove  the  popular  General  Aleksandr 
Lebed'  from  command  of  the  14th  Army  after  Lebed'  voiced 
increasingly  sharp  criticism  of  the  Yeltsin  administration.  But 
Yeltsin  refused  to  remove  Lebed',  magnifying  the  open  struggle 
between  two  top  military  commanders  and  polarizing  the  mili- 
tary. Lebed'  resigned  his  command  in  May  1995  to  begin  a 
political  career. 

Central  Asia 

Large  numbers  of  Soviet  military  forces  were  located  in  the 
five  Central  Asian  republics  when  the  Soviet  Union  dissolved 
officially  at  the  end  of  1991.  All  the  newly  independent  states 
took  measures  to  gain  control  over  the  Soviet  units  they  inher- 
ited, establishing  a  variety  of  agencies  and  ministries  to  define 
the  gradual  process  of  localization.  In  the  mid-1990s,  as  sup- 
port grew  in  Russia  for  recapturing  in  some  form  the  lost  terri- 
tories of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  attention  focused  on  the  five 
Central  Asian  republics,  which  still  had  substantial  economic 
and  military  ties  with  the  Russian  Federation.  When  the  Soviet 
Union  dissolved  at  the  end  of  1991,  the  main  military  force  in 
Tajikistan  was  the  201st  Motorized  Rifle  Division,  whose  posi- 
tion and  resources  the  Russian  Federation  inherited.  Although 
nominally  neutral  in  the  civil  war  that  broke  out  in  Tajikistan  in 
the  fall  of  1992,  the  201st  Division,  together  with  substantial 
forces  from  neighboring  Uzbekistan,  played  a  significant  role 


507 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  recapture  of  the  capital  city,  Dushanbe,  by  former  com- 
munist forces.  As  the  civil  war  continued  in  more  remote 
regions  of  Tajikistan  during  the  next  three  years,  the  201st  Divi- 
sion remained  the  dominant  military  force,  joining  with  Rus- 
sian border  troops  and  a  multinational  group  of  "peace- 
keeping" troops  (dominated  by  Russian  and  Uzbekistani  forces 
and  including  troops  from  Kazakstan  and  Kyrgyzstan)  to  patrol 
the  porous  border  between  Tajikistan  and  Afghanistan. 

The  openly  avowed  purpose  of  the  continued  occupation 
was  to  protect  Russia's  strategic  interests.  Those  interests  were 
defined  as  preventing  radical  Islamic  politicization  and  the 
shipment  of  narcotics,  both  designated  as  serious  menaces  to 
Russia  itself.  Meanwhile,  Tajikistan  formed  a  small  army  of  its 
own,  of  which  about  three-quarters  of  the  officer  corps  were 
Russians  in  mid-1996.  Tajikistan,  having  no  air  force,  relied 
exclusively  on  Russian  air  power.  In  mid-1996  the  preponder- 
ance of  the  estimated  16,500  troops  guarding  Tajikistan's  bor- 
ders belonged  to  Russia's  Federal  Border  Service.  Border 
troops  received  artillery  and  armor  support  from  the  201st 
Division,  whose  strength  was  estimated  in  1996  as  at  least 
12,000  troops. 

Russia  has  kept  more  limited  forces  in  the  other  Central 
Asian  republics.  Turkmenistan  consistently  has  refused  to  join 
multilateral  CIS  military  groupings,  but  Russia  maintains  joint 
command  of  the  three  motorized  rifle  divisions  in  the  Turk- 
menistan! army.  Under  a  1993  bilateral  military  cooperation 
treaty,  some  2,000  Russian  officers  serve  in  Turkmenistan  on 
contract,  and  border  forces  (about  5,000  in  1995)  are  under 
joint  Russian  and  Turkmenistan!  command.  Altogether,  about 
11,000  Russian  troops  remained  in  Turkmenistan  in  mid-1996. 
Uzbekistan  has  full  command  of  its  armed  forces,  although  the 
air  force  is  dominated  by  ethnic  Russians  and  Russia  provides 
extensive  assistance  in  training,  border  patrols,  and  air  defense. 
Kazakstan,  which  has  the  largest  standing  army  (about  25,000 
in  1996)  of  the  Central  Asian  republics,  had  replaced  most  of 
the  Russians  in  its  command  positions  with  Kazaks  by  1995 — 
mainly  because  a  large  part  of  the  Russian  officer  corps  trans- 
ferred elsewhere  in  the  early  1990s.  No  complete  Russian  units 
are  stationed  in  Kazakstan,  but  an  estimated  6,000  troops  from 
the  former  Soviet  40th  Army  remained  there  in  training  posi- 
tions in  1996,  including  about  1,500  at  the  Baykonur  space 
launch  center,  which  Russia  leases  from  Kazakstan. 


508 


The  Armed  Forces 


In  Kyrgyzstan,  which  has  developed  little  military  capability 
of  its  own,  Russian  units  guard  the  border  with  China.  But 
maintaining  military  influence  in  Kyrgyzstan  has  not  been  a 
high  priority  of  Russian  military  planners;  a  1994  bilateral 
agreement  improves  incentives  for  Russian  officers  to  remain 
in  the  Kyrgyzstan's  army  on  a  contract  basis  through  1999,  but, 
as  in  Kazakstan,  the  Russian  exodus  has  continued.  President 
Askar  Akayev  of  Kyrgyzstan  lobbied  for  a  larger  Russian  mili- 
tary presence  to  improve  his  country's  security  situation,  but 
no  action  had  been  taken  as  of  mid-1996. 

Kaliningrad 

In  the  immediate  postwar  period,  the  Soviet  Union  estab- 
lished a  formidable,  closed  enclave  in  the  former  East  Prussia, 
including  a  large  naval  port  at  Kaliningrad  (formerly  Konigs- 
berg).  When  the  Soviet  Union  collapsed,  the  independence  of 
Estonia,  Latvia,  and  Lithuania  deprived  the  new  Russian  state 
of  major  ports  on  the  Baltic  Sea,  and  15,000-square-kilometer 
Kaliningrad  Oblast  between  Poland  and  Lithuania  was  cut  off 
from  Russia.  When  Russia  insisted  on  maintaining  Kaliningrad 
as  a  heavily  armed  garrison,  it  aroused  considerable  interna- 
tional criticism,  especially  from  Poland.  Konigsberg  was 
awarded  to  the  Soviet  Union  under  the  Potsdam  Accord  in 
1945,  but  the  Russian  Federation  holds  no  legal  title  to  the 
enclave. 

When  Russia  withdrew  all  its  former  Warsaw  Pact  forces  from 
Poland  and  the  Baltic  states  during  1992-94,  some  air,  naval, 
and  ground  forces  were  relocated  to  Kaliningrad,  ostensibly 
because  of  housing  shortages  elsewhere  in  Russia.  In  mid-1996 
the  official  military  garrison  was  estimated  at  24,000  ground 
troops  of  the  11th  Guards  Combined  Arms  Army,  including 
one  tank  division  and  three  motorized  rifle  divisions,  three 
artillery  brigades,  surface-to-surface  and  surface-to-air  missiles, 
and  attack  helicopters.  The  Baltic  Fleet,  which  has  its  head- 
quarters at  Kaliningrad,  includes  three  cruisers,  two  destroyers, 
eighteen  frigates,  sixty-five  patrol  boats,  and  195  combat  air- 
craft, together  with  one  brigade  of  naval  infantry  and  two  regi- 
ments of  coastal  defense  artillery.  Western  experts  estimate 
that  the  total  Kaliningrad  garrison  includes  as  many  as  200,000 
military  personnel,  compared  with  the  official  Russian  figure  of 
100,000. 

In  1993  the  population  of  the  enclave  was  about  900,000,  of 
whom  about  700,000  were  Russians.  There  is  strong  sentiment 


509 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

in  favor  of  autonomy  among  the  civilian  population,  and  inter- 
national pressure  continues  to  advocate  reducing  the  garrison 
to  a  level  of  "reasonable  sufficiency,"  far  below  its  current  size. 
Many  Russian  military  authorities  agree  with  this  idea  because 
maintaining  the  Kaliningrad  force  is  extremely  expensive. 
However,  a  large-scale  deemphasis  of  the  military  would  be  dif- 
ficult because  the  entire  oblast  has  been  structured  to  meet  the 
needs  of  the  armed  forces.  In  addition,  Russian  nationalists 
argue  that  Kaliningrad  is  a  vital  outpost  at  a  time  when  Russia  is 
menaced  by  possible  Polish  or  even  Lithuanian  membership  in 
NATO. 

China 

In  1995  and  1996,  Russia  and  China  moved  closer  on  eco- 
nomic and  military  issues,  after  many  years  of  insecurity  along 
the  two  countries'  long  common  frontier.  On  the  Russian  side, 
the  move  was  prompted  by  a  new  general  emphasis  on  rela- 
tions with  Asia  that  also  includes  the  Korean  Peninsula  and 
Southeast  Asia;  on  the  Chinese  side,  there  was  concern  about 
the  stability  of  the  Central  Asian  republics  and  the  possible 
spread  of  separatist  sentiments  together  with  politicized  Islam, 
especially  in  the  predominantly  Muslim  Xinjiang  Uygur  Auton- 
omous Region,  which  borders  Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan,  and 
Kazakstan.  With  Russia  sharing  those  concerns,  in  April  1996 
Beijing  and  Moscow  announced  a  "strategic  partnership"  that 
was  hailed  as  a  watershed  agreement  and  was  accompanied  by 
combined  blasts  at  Western  attempts  to  dominate  lesser  coun- 
tries. China  voiced  support  for  Russia's  Chechnya  operation, 
and  Russia  backed  China's  claims  of  hegemony  in  Taiwan  and 
Tibet. 

New  military  agreements  provide  for  long-term  military  and 
technical  cooperation,  including  Russian  aid  to  Chinese  arms 
industries,  modernization  of  weapons  already  sold  to  China, 
and  the  sale  of  new  weapons  to  China  at  advantageous  prices. 
Among  the  reported  terms  of  the  April  1996  agreement  is  the 
sharing  of  space  technology  by  Russia's  State  Space  Agency,  the 
sale  of  diesel  submarines  and  S-300  air  defense  missile  com- 
plexes, and  production  in  China  of  Su-27  jet  fighters. 

In  the  April  1996  talks,  the  two  sides  pledged  to  observe  ear- 
lier border  demarcation  agreements,  and  Russia  ceded  some 
disputed  pieces  of  land.  The  issue  of  reducing  military  forces 
and  defining  the  border  was  the  subject  of  ongoing  talks  in 
1996.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  NATO  Issue 

The  Russian  military  has  unanimously  opposed  any  expan- 
sion of  NATO  in  Central  Europe  or  the  former  Soviet  Union 
since  the  idea  first  appeared  in  the  early  1990s,  and  virtually  all 
political  factions  are  in  agreement.  Russia  worries  that  such 
expansion  would  leave  it  in  a  strategically  untenable  position, 
despite  NATO's  claims  of  the  purely  defensive  character  of  its 
alliance.  In  the  mid-1990s,  Russian  fears  have  been  fanned  by 
the  increasingly  influential  anti-Western  factions  in  the  State 
Duma  and  by  the  increased  urgency  with  which  Central  Euro- 
pean and  Baltic  states  have  sought  NATO  membership. 

Russian  military  thinkers  see  NATO  expansion  as  moving 
the  world's  most  powerful  military  force  to  the  very  border  of 
the  former  Soviet  Union  (or  even  past  the  border,  were 
Ukraine  and  the  Baltic  states  to  join).  Contrary  to  Western 
claims,  Russians  see  no  potential  for  improvement  in  Russia's 
security  in  this  process,  except  in  the  unlikely  inclusion  of  Rus- 
sia as  a  full  NATO  member.  In  1994  Russia  was  offered,  and 
eventually  accepted,  membership  in  the  NATO  Partnership  for 
Peace  (PfP — see  Glossary),  into  which  all  former  Soviet  repub- 
lics and  former  Warsaw  Pact  members  were  admitted  by  the 
end  of  1995  (see  NATO,  ch.  8). 

In  the  period  1994-96,  top-level  Russian  national  security 
representatives  put  forward  a  variety  of  threats  and  proposals 
on  the  subject  of  NATO  expansion.  Extreme  nationalist  fac- 
tions used  the  issue  to  back  their  argument  that  the  United 
States  is  leading  an  international  plot  against  Russia.  In  1995  a 
set  of  perceived  NATO  deceptions  of  Russian  negotiators  in 
Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  was  used  as  evidence  of  NATO's 
untrustworthiness.  Russia  counterproposed  that  NATO  trans- 
form itself  into  a  strictly  political  alliance  that  would  become 
part  of  a  new  pan-European  security  system  on  the  model  of 
the  OSCE.  Meanwhile,  Russia  has  exerted  strong  pressure  on 
the  states  most  imminently  eligible  for  NATO  membership, 
especially  Poland,  Hungary,  and  the  Baltic  states,  including 
threats  that  nuclear  war  might  break  out  in  Central  Europe  if 
Russia  needed  to  defend  itself  against  NATO  forces  that  had 
moved  into  the  region.  In  1995  Russian  national  security  repre- 
sentatives promised  that  NATO  expansion  would  suspend  Rus- 
sian compliance  with  the  CFE  Treaty  and  make  impossible 
Russian  ratification  of  part  two  of  the  Strategic  Arms  Reduction 
Treaty  (START  II) — two  cornerstones  of  disarmament  in  the 
view  of  Western  policy  makers.  Meanwhile,  the  "NATO  threat" 


512 


The  Armed  Forces 


was  a  rationale  for  maintaining  a  large  garrison  at  the  western 
outpost  in  Kaliningrad. 

Nuclear  Arms  Issues 

In  the  1990s,  Russia's  status  as  a  nuclear  power  raised  two 
major  issues.  First,  the  deactivation  of  nuclear  weapons  in  Rus- 
sia and  elsewhere  in  the  former  Soviet  Union  caused  a  series  of 
problems  that  affected  primarily  the  civilian  population.  Sec- 
ond, the  rate  and  conditions  for  reduction  of  Russia's  nuclear 
arsenal  were  matters  of  heated  debate  among  military  and  civil- 
ian policy  makers  in  the  mid-1990s. 

During  five  decades  of  the  Cold  War,  the  Soviet  Union  stock- 
piled an  estimated  40,000  nuclear  warheads,  which  were 
located  from  the  Far  East  to  the  Ukrainian  Republic  on  the 
western  border.  Besides  the  Russian  Republic,  three  other 
Soviet  republics — Belorussia,  Kazakstan,  and  Ukraine — had 
nuclear  weapons  on  their  soil.  In  the  early  1990s,  Russia  and 
the  United  States  agreed  that,  to  prevent  proliferation  of 
nuclear  weapons  and  materials,  the  three  other  republics 
should  relinquish  their  entire  stockpiles  to  Russia  or  destroy 
them.  Although  the  final  cleanup  of  nuclear  materials  prom- 
ises to  last  into  the  next  century,  by  the  end  of  1994  the  three 
former  Soviet  republics  had  signed  START  I  and  the  NPT  as 
nonnuclear  states.  (Ukraine  required  additional  security  assur- 
ances and  financial  aid  from  the  United  States  as  a  condition  of 
its  participation.) 

Experts  estimated  that  disposal  of  all  deactivated  nuclear 
warheads  would  require  at  least  ten  years  because  Russian  facil- 
ities can  only  dismantle  2,000  warheads  per  year.  Another  com- 
plication is  the  disposition  of  an  estimated  100,000  now- 
superfluous  employees  of  nuclear  weapons  installations  who 
had  access  to  nuclear  technology;  failure  to  find  suitable 
employment  for  such  individuals  might  cause  them  to  sell  their 
highly  valuable  knowledge  abroad.  And  the  total  number  of 
displaced  employees  of  nuclear  installations  is  estimated  to  be 
much  larger. 

The  presence  of  nuclear  material  in  Russia  has  caused  other 
problems.  Between  1990  and  1994,  the  number  of  documented 
cases  of  smuggling  of  nuclear  materials  out  of  Russia  went  from 
zero  to  124,  mainly  because  of  lax  security  at  nuclear  sites  (see 
Crime,  ch.  10).  Although  most  cases  of  nuclear  smuggling  have 
involved  civilians,  in  1994  naval  officers  stole  three  uranium 
fuel  rods  from  a  submarine  in  Murmansk — and  in  the  mid- 


513 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

1990s  the  fast-deteriorating  living  standards  of  Russia's  military 
made  such  incidents  more  likely  (see  Troop  Support  Elements, 
this  ch.).  The  Ministry  of  Defense  has  voiced  concern  that  ter- 
rorists might  take  advantage  of  security  lapses  to  seize  a  nuclear 
weapon;  in  1995  a  Chechen  guerrilla  leader  threatened  to  use 
nuclear  terrorism  against  Russia's  civilian  population.  In  a  deal 
signed  in  1992,  the  United  States  agreed  to  buy  500  tons  of 
weapons-grade  uranium,  mainly  to  ensure  that  such  material 
did  not  move  into  unscrupulous  hands.  In  December  1994, 
Russia  and  the  United  States  agreed  to  inform  each  other  of 
dangerous  incidents  involving  nuclear  materials,  and  the 
United  States  has  provided  assistance  in  upgrading  Russia's 
nuclear  security  procedures. 

A  second  problem  related  to  Russia's  nuclear  arms  is  the 
radiation  pollution  that  has  resulted  from  the  discarding  of 
nuclear  materials  into  the  ground  and  the  sea.  The  naval  forces 
have  continued  the  Soviet-era  practice  of  dumping  nuclear 
materials  overboard  in  the  Sea  of  Japan  and  the  Kara  Sea,  pro- 
voking strong  reactions  from  neighboring  countries.  In  mid- 
1996  at  least  fifty  of  Russia's  decommissioned  nuclear  subma- 
rines were  standing  with  fuel  rods  intact  along  the  Arctic  coast, 
awaiting  dismantlement  (see  Environmental  Conditions,  ch. 
3). 

The  geopolitical  and  diplomatic  aspects  of  the  nuclear  situa- 
tion are  equally  problematic.  Russia  ratified  START  I  in 
November  1992.  That  treaty  limited  the  United  States  and  Rus- 
sia to  1,600  strategic  nuclear  delivery  vehicles  (bombers,  sub- 
marines, and  intercontinental  ballistic  missiles — ICBMs)  and 
6,000  nuclear  warheads  each.  (The  actual  number  was  between 
7,000  and  9,000  because  of  the  treaty's  counting  rules.)  The 
treaty  also  set  a  limit  of  4,900  ballistic  missile  warheads  and 
1,100  warheads  mounted  on  mobile  ICBMs.  The  number  and 
configuration  of  bombers  also  was  prescribed. 

In  January  1993,  United  States  president  George  H.W.  Bush 
and  President  Yeltsin  signed  START  II.  That  treaty,  which  is 
based  on  the  limitations  of  START  I,  would  eliminate  heavy 
ICBMs  and  ICBMs  with  multiple  warheads,  and  the  total  num- 
ber of  warheads  would  be  reduced  from  the  nominal  START  I 
level  of  6,000  to  an  actual  figure  between  3,000  and  3,500. 
START  II  calls  for  two  phases  of  reduction,  the  first  of  which 
would  begin  in  2000.  At  the  end  of  the  second  phase,  new 
reductions  would  be  complete  in  all  three  delivery  modes: 
land-based  ICBM,  submarine,  and  bomber.

The  Armed  Forces 


In  March  1993,  the  Supreme  Soviet  (later  in  1993  renamed 
the  State  Duma)  began  discussion  of  START  II.  The  debate 
over  ratification  of  the  treaty  continued  sporadically  for  three 
years  and  showed  no  signs  of  reaching  a  resolution  as  of  mid- 
1996.  Opponents  of  the  treaty  described  it  as  another  Western 
effort  to  penetrate  Russia's  national  security;  treaty  backers, 
including  Yeltsin,  argued  that  maintaining  the  nuclear  force  at 
START  I  levels  was  financially  impossible  for  Russia,  so  the 
much  lower  START  II  level  matches  Russia's  capabilities  while 
holding  the  United  States  far  below  its  potential.  In  any  case, 
most  of  the  2,500  warheads  that  START  II  would  eliminate 
were  outmoded  and  scheduled  for  retirement  by  the  mid- 
1990s.  According  to  Western  experts,  in  1996  Russia  had  the 
financial  resources  to  deploy  only  about  500  single-warhead 
ICBMs,  although  more  than  900  were  permitted  under  START 
I  at  that  point  (see  Strategic  Rocket  Forces,  this  ch.).  Also,  Rus- 
sia's failure  to  ratify  START  II  encouraged  the  United  States  to 
deploy  an  anti-ballistic  missile  (ABM)  system  that  would  negate 
much  of  Russia's  nuclear  potential.  The  matchup  of  potential 
United  States  ABM  capabilities  with  existing  Russian  nuclear 
strike  capabilities  became  a  key  consideration  in  the  START  II 
ratification  debate. 

Nevertheless,  beginning  in  1995  the  question  of  NATO 
expansion  overshadowed  other  aspects  of  the  START  II  debate; 
the  more  anti-Western  State  Duma  that  was  seated  in  January 
1996  made  the  impending  expansion  of  NATO  a  primary  argu- 
ment against  START  II  ratification.  Some  Russian  treaty  sup- 
porters concurred  that  the  treaty  should  not  be  ratified  unless 
NATO  expansion  plans  were  shelved. 

The  Defense  Industry 

The  Russian  Federation  inherited  the  largest  and  most  pro- 
ductive share  of  the  former  Soviet  defense  industry,  employing 
as  many  as  9  million  workers  in  1,125  to  1,500  research,  design, 
and  production  facilities.  Those  installations  are  concentrated 
in  particular  regions,  whose  economies  tend  to  be  heavily 
dependent  on  the  industry;  in  the  Republic  of  Udmurtia,  for 
example,  more  than  two-thirds  of  workers  and  industrial  capac- 
ity were  attached  to  defense  in  some  way  in  the  early  1990s. 
Moscow  has  large  plants  for  air  force  and  missile  components, 
and  St.  Petersburg  specializes  in  naval  design  and  production 
as  well  as  infantry  weapons.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Structure  and  Conditions 

Russia's  military-industrial  complex  (MIC)  is  coordinated  by 
the  State  Committee  for  the  Defense  Industry  (Gosudarstven- 
nyy  komitet  po  oboronnoy  promyshlennosti — Goskomoboron- 
prom).  In  1996  this  agency  included  about  2,000  production 
enterprises  and  920  research  organizations  with  a  directly 
employed  work  force  of  about  5  million.  However,  a  1996  esti- 
mate identified  about  35  million  Russians  as  receiving  their 
income  from  enterprises  linked  in  some  way  to  Goskomobo- 
ronprom.  The  research  organizations  are  the  heart  of  Russian 
military  research  and  development.  They  take  new  weapons 
and  military  materiel  projects  from  concept  to  prototype,  then 
hand  them  off  to  the  production  enterprises.  Production 
enterprises  do  prototype  construction,  production  runs,  and 
modifications. 

Zinoviy  Pak  was  appointed  director  of  Goskomoboronprom 
in  January  1996.  Prior  to  his  promotion,  Pak  managed  a  large 
defense  enterprise  in  Moscow.  His  predecessor,  Viktor 
Glukhikh,  was  dismissed  by  President  Yeltsin  for  mismanage- 
ment— a  move  that  made  Glukhikh  the  scapegoat  for  a  multi- 
tude of  problems  that  beset  the  defense  industry  in  the  first 
half  of  the  1990s. 

The  Russian  MIC  includes  an  industrial  base  that  is  wholly 
owned  by  the  Russian  military.  In  the  Soviet  era,  defense  indus- 
tries were  created  solely  to  arm  the  Soviet  Union,  and  as  such 
they  had  the  highest  national  priority  in  the  allocation  of  tech- 
nology and  talent.  The  complex  regularly  consumed  20  per- 
cent of  the  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  and  15 
percent  of  the  industrial  labor  force.  In  the  drive  for  privatiza- 
tion after  the  fall  of  communism,  Russian  planners  initially 
believed  that  this,  the  best  supplied  and  most  efficient  of  Rus- 
sian industries,  could  be  converted  easily  to  production  for  the 
civilian  market  and  thereafter  would  become  an  engine  of  eco- 
nomic growth.  Such  optimism  obscured  the  complex's  total 
lack  of  a  civilian  market  for  its  products  and  its  inexperience  in 
developing  and  selling  goods  in  a  competitive  marketplace. 
Beginning  in  the  late  Gorbachev  era,  planners  mistakenly 
expected  to  achieve  conversion  by  a  Soviet-style  centralized 
program  and  without  additional  funding  to  support  the 
lengthy,  stagewise  conversion  process. 

Although  MIC  conversion  received  much  publicity  and  bil- 
lions of  dollars  in  Western  aid  after  1992,  government  funding 
for  that  program  decreased  steadily  in  the  mid-1990s,  and  only 


516 


The  Armed  Forces 


a  small  percentage  of  allotted  funds  actually  were  spent  for 
conversion.  No  funds  were  authorized  for  conversion  in  the 
1995  budget.  Some  defense  industries  have  mounted  successful 
conversion  and  restructuring  programs,  however.  Russia's  lead- 
ing aviation  firm,  the  Mikoyan-Gurevich  (MiG)  Aviation-Scien- 
tific Production  Complex,  has  formed  joint  ventures  with  the 
Moscow  Aircraft  Production  Association  (MAPO)  and  enter- 
prises in  Germany,  India,  and  Malaysia.  The  Sukhoy  Holding 
Corporation  has  been  formed  to  combine  formerly  separate 
design,  development,  and  production  operations  for  high-per- 
formance aircraft;  Sukhoy  has  branched  out  into  production  of 
business  and  commuter  aircraft,  which  accounted  for  about 
half  its  sales  in  1995.  The  MiG  and  Yakovlev  design  bureaus 
also  began  developing  commercial  aircraft  in  the  early  1990s. 

Given  its  intrinsic  shortcomings,  the  MIC  became  a  major 
liability  rather  than  a  boon  to  the  Russian  economy  as  the  ini- 
tial momentum  of  conversion  dissipated.  In  December  1995, 
the  complex's  average  basic  wage  rate  fell  to  two-thirds  the 
average  for  industries  in  the  nonmilitary  sector. 

Shortly  after  assuming  the  Goskomoboronprom  director- 
ship, Pak  admitted  that  the  defense  industry  could  not  survive 
unless  it  were  reconfigured.  He  proposed  a  smaller  military 
and  a  smaller  defense  industry — a  course  whose  wisdom  was 
reflected  in  statistics  on  recent  performance.  In  1995  defense 
industrial  production  fell  by  21  percent  compared  with  1994, 
when  production  in  turn  was  25  percent  lower  than  1993.  In 
January  1996,  orders  were  25  percent  below  the  level  for  Janu- 
ary 1995,  and  in  the  first  half  of  1996  the  Ministry  of  Defense 
had  not  completed  payment  for  its  1994  and  1995  deliveries 
from  defense  plants.  Hardest  hit  were  the  shipbuilding,  radio, 
electronics,  and  ammunition  industries.  The  reason  for  such  a 
steady  decline  is  that  the  MIC  had  only  a  single  customer,  the 
Ministry  of  Defense,  which  had  an  ever-shrinking  budget  allo- 
cation for  repairing  and  modernizing  old  equipment,  buying 
new  materiel,  and  funding  research  for  future  models.  Because 
few  enterprises  of  the  MIC  had  been  privatized  (a  situation  that 
ensured  that  complete  state  control  would  continue),  govern- 
ment subsidies  kept  many  alive  through  the  mid-1990s. 

Between  1991  and  1994,  annual  production  of  main  battle 
tanks  dropped  from  900  to  forty,  of  infantry  fighting  vehicles 
from  3,000  to  400,  of  fighter  aircraft  from  225  to  fifty,  and  of 
helicopters  from  350  to  100.  Those  statistics  partly  reflect  the 
intentional  reduction  of  forces  that  began  in  the  late  Gor- 


517 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

bachev  era  before  the  dissolution  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  in  1991, 
but  they  also  indicate  the  overall  deterioration  of  the  industry. 

In  the  first  half  of  1996,  the  only  fully  active  production  pro- 
gram was  that  for  the  SS-25  intercontinental  ballistic  missile 
(ICBM).  Some  other  enterprises  were  producing  relatively 
small  batches  of  armored  vehicles,  most  of  which  were  for 
export.  The  great  majority  of  the  production  facilities,  includ- 
ing most  of  the  aircraft  and  shipbuilding  installations,  were 
dormant. 

The  Defense  Budget 

The  1996  defense  budget  of  the  Russian  Federation,  ratified 
by  the  State  Duma  in  December  1995,  allotted  78.9  trillion 
rubles  (about  US$19  billion — see  Glossary  for  value  of  the 
ruble),  of  which  about  16  percent,  or  12.6  trillion  rubles 
(about  US$3.0  billion),  was  allocated  to  acquisitions,  and  7.3 
percent,  or  5.8  trillion  rubles  (about  US$1.4  billion),  was  ear- 
marked for  research  and  development  (R&D).  Russia's  1995 
budget  had  allocated  10.2  percent  to  R&D  and  21.2  percent  to 
acquisitions.  By  comparison,  the  1996  United  States  budget  for 
the  Department  of  Defense  totaled  US$249  billion,  of  which 
US$39  billion  (15.7  percent)  was  designated  for  acquisitions 
and  US$34  billion  (13.7  percent)  for  R&D.  In  February  1996, 
the  Security  Council  allocated  between  50  and  54  trillion 
rubles  (US$10  to  US$11  billion)  to  fund  additional  state  orders 
from  the  MIC,  including  money  for  accelerated  R&D  and  pro- 
duction of  advanced  weapons  systems.  This  supplementary,  tar- 
geted allocation  represented  a  significant  increase  over  the 
allocations  for  1994  (US$2  billion)  and  1995  (about  US$3.4  bil- 
lion), indicating  a  possible  redirection  of  resources  to  R&D 
even  as  the  military  operating  budget  remained  flat. 

New  Weaponry  Acquisitions 

Despite  the  general  crisis  besetting  the  defense  industry, 
examples  of  highly  advanced  military  technology  continued  to 
emerge  from  Russia's  defense  plants  in  the  mid-1990s.  The  T— 
90  main  battle  tank,  the  most  modern  tank  in  the  army  arsenal, 
went  into  low-level  production  in  1993,  based  on  a  prototype 
designated  as  the  T-88.  The  T-90  was  developed  by  the  Kar- 
tsev-Venediktov  Design  Bureau  at  the  Vagonka  Works  in  Nizh- 
niy  Tagil.  Initially  seen  as  an  entirely  new  design,  the 
production  model  is  in  fact  based  on  the  T-72BM,  with  some 
added  features  from  the  T-80  series.  The  T-90  features  a  new 


518 


The  Armed  Forces 


generation  of  armor  on  its  hull  and  turret.  Two  variants,  the  T- 
90S  and  T-90E,  have  been  identified  as  possible  export  mod- 
els. Plans  called  for  all  earlier  models  to  be  replaced  with  T-90s 
by  the  end  of  1997,  subject  to  funding  availability.  By  mid-1996 
some  107  T-90s  had  gone  into  service  in  the  Far  Eastern  Mili- 
tary District. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  first  priority  for  the  air  forces  was  the 
Su-T-60S  multirole  bomber,  which  had  been  designed  to 
replace  the  Tu-22M  and  the  Su-24  (see  Force  Structure,  this 
ch.).  The  Su-T-60S  is  a  long-range  supersonic  tactical/opera- 
tional nuclear-capable  bomber  with  built-in  stealth  technology 
developed  by  the  Sukhoy  Design  Bureau.  Although  its  develop- 
ment was  officially  secret,  the  Su-T-60S  was  reported  to  be  in 
the  prototype  stage  and  ready  for  flight  testing  in  mid-1996. 

The  second  priority  for  the  air  forces  was  the  Su-27IB  tacti- 
cal fighter-bomber  being  built  for  the  Frontal  Aviation  Com- 
mand. A  naval  aviation  version  was  designated  the  Su-32FN. 
This  side-by-side,  two-seat  aircraft  was  in  serial  production  in 
the  mid-1990s  at  the  Sukhoy  Chkalov  Aircraft  Plant  in  Novosi- 
birsk. In  its  bomber  mode,  the  Su-27IB  was  expected  to  be 
armed  with  the  AA-11  Archer  short-range  air-to-air  missile,  and 
in  its  fighter  mode  with  the  AA-12  Adder  mid-range,  air-to-air, 
fire-and-forget  missile. 

Russia's  submarine  technology  developed  faster  in  the  mid- 
1990s  than  Western  experts  had  expected,  as  the  fleet  under- 
went reduction  from  its  1986  total  of  186  vessels  to  ninety-nine. 
According  to  one  intelligence  estimate,  more  than  half  of  the 
1996  fleet  was  capable  of  moving  undetected  into  Western  sea- 
lanes.  In  mid-1996  the  navy  scheduled  four  submarines  for  pro- 
duction, including  one  upgraded  addition  to  its  existing  fleet 
of  Akula-class  vessels  and  three  of  the  new  Severodvinsk  class, 
which  were  expected  to  go  into  service  in  2000.  The  Severod- 
vinsk is  a  state-of-the  art  submarine  that  allegedly  is  so  quiet 
that  it  eliminates  the  United  States  technical  lead  in  this  area, 
and  it  is  armed  with  the  new  650mm  Shkval  rocket  that  travels 
at  200  knots  underwater. 

The  new  modification  of  the  SS-25  ICBM,  the  Topol  M-2,  is 
a  three-stage,  solid-fuel  rocket  designed  to  carry  a  single  war- 
head. Scheduled  to  go  into  production  in  1996,  the  Topol  M-2 
is  a  permitted  modernization  under  START  I  terms;  it  can  be 
deployed  in  a  fixed  silo  or  made  mobile.  Because  it  is  ear- 
marked for  the  elite  strategic  rocket  forces  as  a  replacement  for 
missiles  being  destroyed  under  START  I,  the  Topol  is  a  high- 


519

priority  project  protected  from  cutbacks  in  the  acquisitions 
budget. 

Information  about  the  funding  of  Russia's  defense  R&D  pro- 
grams remains  hard  to  obtain  because  many  such  programs  are 
secret.  The  official  budget  allocation  of  US$1.4  billion,  even 
with  the  addition  of  the  Security  Council's  supplemental  fund- 
ing in  February  1996,  seems  extremely  modest  in  an  era  of 
rapid  technological  advances.  Most  of  the  acquisition  programs 
of  the  mid-1990s  do  not  have  known  R&D  follow-on  programs; 
instead,  they  are  products  of  R&D  programs  started  in  the  early 
1980s. 

The  MiG-MAPO  1.42  R&D  program  has  been  advertised  as 
the  Russian  response  to  the  United  States  Air  Force's  F-22 
advanced  tactical  fighter  (ATF)  program.  The  MiG-MAPO 
1.42,  a  single-seat,  multirole  stealth  fighter,  is  projected  to 
reach  operational  capability  between  2005  and  2008.  The  air 
force  R&D  funds  also  reportedly  have  been  shifted  to  a  high- 
priority  program  to  field  highly  accurate  precision-guided 
munitions  (PGM)  in  response  to  the  United  States  success  with 
that  type  of  weapon  in  the  Persian  Gulf  War  of  1991.  A  shift  of 
funds  to  the  PGM  program  may  further  delay  the  MiG-MAPO 
1.42  program. 

Beginning  in  1993,  the  defense  industry  had  an  influential 
spokesman  at  Yeltsin's  side  to  lobby  for  improved  support.  First 
Deputy  Prime  Minister  Oleg  Soskovets,  long  a  top  metallurgy 
industry  executive  in  the  Soviet  era,  was  a  forceful  proponent 
of  bolstering  the  existing  complex  with  minimum  privatization 
or  conversion  to  civilian  production.  However,  Soskovets,  who 
was  chiefly  responsible  for  increasing  Russia's  defense  budget 
by  3  trillion  rubles  in  1996,  was  dismissed  unexpectedly  in  June 
1996  when  Yeltsin  ousted  most  of  the  hard-liners  from  his  inner 
circle  in  preparation  for  the  second  round  of  that  year's  presi- 
dential election. 

Foreign  Arms  Sales 

In  the  first  half  of  1996,  defense  planners  appeared  to  favor 
delaying  privatization  and  civilianization  and  letting  the  MIC 
do  what  it  does  best:  make  weapons.  Instead  of  depending 
upon  Russia's  armed  forces  as  the  customer,  Soskovets  intensi- 
fied his  pursuit  of  the  international  arms  market  in  an  attempt 
to  improve  the  industry's  earnings.  Russia  offered  military 
hardware  both  for  sale  as  a  means  to  raise  capital  and  in  barter 
arrangements  to  repay  international  debts.  In  April  1996,  the 


520 


The  Armed  Forces 


State  Corporation  for  Export  and  Import  of  Armaments  (Ros- 
vooruzheniye)  reported  fifty-one  countries  as  current  custom- 
ers, with  the  largest  sales  totals  involving  China,  India,  Syria, 
and  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE).  Together  with  lesser  cus- 
tomers Algeria,  Cuba,  Kuwait,  Malaysia,  Turkey,  and  Vietnam, 
those  countries  accounted  for  75  percent  of  arms  sales  in  early 
1996.  Arms  exports  were  being  produced  at  more  than  500 
enterprises  in  Russia  and  more  than  1,200  enterprises  in  ten 
other  CIS  nations  having  production-sharing  agreements  with 
Russia. 

Arms  sales  and  military  technology  transfers  to  China 
expanded  rapidly  in  the  mid-1990s,  although  many  defense 
authorities  had  strong  reservations  about  sharing  advanced 
technology  with  such  an  unpredictable  neighbor.  For  China, 
Russia  is  a  source  of  sophisticated,  reasonably  priced  arma- 
ments unavailable  from  the  West.  For  Russia,  China  is  another 
source  of  hard  currency  (see  Glossary).  Among  China's  key 
purchases  in  recent  years  were  Su-27  fighter-bombers,  MiG-31 
fighters,  heavy  transport  aircraft,  T-72  tanks,  and  S-300  antiair- 
craft missile  launchers.  In  1994  and  1995  agreements,  China 
bought  a  total  of  ten  Kilo-class  diesel  submarines,  the  first  four 
of  which  cost  US$1  billion  altogether.  Russia  received  repeated 
warnings  from  the  United  States  about  the  dangers  of  enhanc- 
ing China's  military  capabilities.  Such  a  warning  came  in  May 
1996  against  the  sale  of  technology  for  SS-18  ICBMs,  which 
China  had  requested  ostensibly  for  its  space  program. 

Russia  has  agreed  to  repay  part  of  its  trade  debt  to  Finland 
with  its  modern  SA-11  air  defense  missile  system  in  a  deal 
worth  US$400  million.  The  SA-1 1  is  an  army-level,  mobile,  low- 
to  medium-altitude,  surface-to-air  missile  system  that  went  into 
serial  production  in  1979.  The  SA-11  can  successfully  engage 
any  aircraft  at  altitudes  from  fifteen  to  22,000  meters  at  a  range 
of  up  to  35,000  meters  using  its  tracking  and  engagement  radar 
system.  It  has  an  on-board  identification  friend-or-foe  (IFF)  sys- 
tem and  an  electronic  countermeasures  suite.  Experts  pre- 
dicted that  Finland  would  employ  the  SA-11  as  its  national  air 
defense  system.  The  SA-11  also  is  in  service  in  India,  Poland, 
Syria,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Yugoslavia  (Montenegro  and  Ser- 
bia), and  several  former  Soviet  republics. 

In  yet  another  debt  reduction  arrangement,  Russia  is  fur- 
nishing Hungary  200  BTR-80  wheeled  armored  personnel  car- 
riers (APCs)  as  replacements  for  the  thirty-year-old  Hungarian-

armored  vehicle  with  a  diesel  power  plant.  It  is  manufactured 
at  the  Gorkiy  Automobile  Factory  in  Nizhniy  Novgorod  and  has 
been  in  service  since  the  early  1980s.  The  BTR-80  is  a  lightly 
armored  amphibious  vehicle  with  a  collective  chemical-biologi- 
cal-radiological (CBR)  protective  system.  Operated  by  a  crew  of 
three,  the  vehicle  can  carry  a  squad  of  seven  infantry  troops. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  Russian  defense  industry  was  anticipat- 
ing the  end  of  the  arms  embargo  against  Serbia  as  an  opportu- 
nity to  generate  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  sales. 
Russia's  long  association  with  the  Serbs  has  established  a  tradi- 
tional Russian  arms  market  in  the  Federal  Republic  of  Yugosla- 
via (Montenegro  and  Serbia).  However,  in  the  aftermath  of  an 
extremely  expensive  economic  embargo,  it  is  not  clear  that  the 
Ministry  of  Defense  of  Yugoslavia  has  the  funds  to  purchase 
large  quantities  of  Russian  military  materiel. 

Russia  is  aggressively  promoting  its  combat  aircraft  in  the 
East  Asian  arms  market.  Russia  and  India  signed  a  defense 
agreement  in  November  1994  during  a  state  visit  by  Prime  Min- 
ister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.  This  agreement  marked  the  end  of 
the  strained  relations  that  had  resulted  from  India's  loss  of 
access  to  generous  Soviet  credit  terms  and  low  prices  when 
cash-strapped  Russia  demanded  hard  currency  (see  Glossary) 
after  the  fall  of  the  Soviet  Union  (see  Other  Asian  States,  ch. 
8).  During  a  related  visit  to  India  in  March  1995,  First  Deputy 
Minister  of  Defense  Andrey  Kokoshin  made  a  sale  of  ten  MiG- 
29  aircraft  for  US$200  million.  At  the  time,  Kokoshin  asserted 
that  this  and  future  defense  deals  with  India  would  save  several 
hundred  thousand  jobs  in  the  Russian  defense  sector. 

India  and  Russia  have  a  tradition  of  cooperation  in  arma- 
ments that  began  in  the  1960s;  in  the  mid-1990s,  India  needed 
new  equipment  from  Russia  to  modernize  its  armed  forces  in 
view  of  ongoing  arms  imports  by  traditional  enemy  Pakistan 
and  persistent  suspicion  of  neighboring  China.  In  early  1996, 
India  and  Russia  signed  a  treaty  of  military  technical  coopera- 
tion, estimated  to  be  worth  US$3.5  billion  through  the  expira- 
tion date  of  2003.  Among  key  purchases  are  Russian 
technology  for  armored  vehicles,  artillery,  and  naval  systems  in 
addition  to  aircraft.  In  early  1996,  experts  estimated  that  as 
much  as  70  percent  of  India's  armaments  had  been  purchased 
from  Russia. 

In  early  1996,  MIC  chairman  Pak  astounded  the  United 
States  Army  by  marketing  the  Russian  SA-12  surface-to-air  mis- 
sile system  in  the  UAE  in  direct  competition  with  the  United 


522 


The  Armed  Forces 


States  Army's  Patriot  system.  He  directed  Rosvooruzheniye  to 
offer  the  UAE  the  highest-quality  Russian  strategic  air  defense 
system,  the  SA-12  Gladiator,  as  an  alternative  to  the  Patriot  at 
half  the  cost.  The  offer  also  included  forgiveness  of  some  of 
Russia's  debt  to  the  UAE. 

Prospects  for  the  Defense  Industry 

As  the  defense  budget  faces  annual  threats  of  receiving  a 
smaller  share  of  a  shrinking  GNP,  experts  predict  that  either 
the  defense  industry  will  collapse  under  its  own  weight  in  the 
near  future  or  that  the  national  budget  will  reallocate  so  much 
money  to  civilian  programs  that  the  industry  simply  will  wither 
away. 

The  collapse  theory  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  two  sources 
of  funds  in  the  military  budget  appropriations  that  support  the 
defense  industry — acquisitions  and  R&D — are  shrinking  at  a 
rate  faster  than  the  industry  can  absorb.  Although  Pak  claimed 
in  early  1996  that  defense  orders  constituted  only  15  to  20  per- 
cent of  the  MIC's  current  orders,  the  civilian  economy  was  not 
healthy  enough  to  absorb  the  industry's  new  products,  and 
most  of  the  converted  industries  were  not  producing  items  with 
high  market  appeal.  Therefore,  Pak's  Goskomoboronprom  has 
emphasized  dual-use  technology  that  would  bridge  the  gap 
between  the  two  production  sectors. 

The  fund  reallocation  theory  is  based  on  the  premise  that 
the  real  threats  to  Russian  national  security  are  domestic  prob- 
lems such  as  regionalism,  terrorism,  corruption,  and  crime.  A 
hungry  and  disillusioned  population  existing  on  the  edge  of 
economic  catastrophe  since  1991  does  not  favor  spending 
scarce  funds  on  a  military  for  which  it  perceives  no  immediate 
need. 

The  real  long-term  threat  to  the  Russian  defense  industry  is 
the  reduced  R&D  funding  allotment  in  the  Russian  military 
budget.  In  the  opinion  of  Western  experts,  foreign  sales  will 
not  provide  the  long-term  security  required  to  revive  the  R&D 
programs  of  Russia's  military  laboratories.  In  turn,  the  absence 
of  an  aggressive  research  program  for  new  technology  will 
cause  foreign  markets  to  dry  up.  In  June  1996,  President  Yeltsin 
named  Aleksandr  Lebed',  an  outspoken  advocate  of  smaller, 
better-equipped  armed  forces,  to  chair  the  Security  Council. 
That  move  was  expected  to  end  arbitrary  funding  of  inefficient 
MIC  enterprises,  but  its  meaning  for  future  R&D  was  not  clear. 


523 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  Soviet  Union  produced  an  excellent  array  of  military 
equipment  that  has  been  distributed  around  the  world.  How- 
ever, modernization  has  not  continued  under  the  Russian  Fed- 
eration, and  the  poor  performance  of  Soviet  equipment 
against  United  States  equipment  in  Operation  Desert  Storm 
reduced  the  eagerness  of  international  arms  purchasers. 
Another  problem  is  repair  and  replacement.  The  Russian 
record  on  resupply  to  foreign  defense  ministries  has  not  been 
good,  and  the  well-documented  prospect  of  further  deteriora- 
tion in  the  Russian  MIC  does  not  build  customer  confidence. 

From  the  onset  of  his  tenure  as  director  of  Goskomoboron- 
prom,  Zinoviy  Pak  proved  to  be  an  imaginative  and  aggressive 
marketer  of  Russian  military  hardware.  He  energized  the  mori- 
bund Rosvooruzheniye  to  the  point  that  it  even  was  placing 
sophisticated  advertisements  in  Western  commercial  publica- 
tions aimed  at  United  States  and  NATO  armed  forces.  Pak  also 
entered  Russian  dual-use  technology,  applied  in  such  products 
as  sports  airplanes  and  high-speed  passenger  boats,  in  numer- 
ous international  exhibitions.  In  March  1996,  Soskovets 
reported  that  Russia's  1995  arms  sales  abroad  exceeded  US$3 
billion,  an  increase  of  80  percent  over  1994  and  60  percent 
more  than  sales  to  the  Russian  military.  About  75  percent  of 
foreign  payments  for  weapons  were  made  in  cash.  By  mid-1996 
new  sales  of  about  US$7  billion  already  had  been  identified, 
and  the  predicted  1996  income  was  US$3.5  billion. 

Force  Structure 

The  Armed  Forces  of  the  Russian  Federation  are  organized 
into  six  services  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  In 
1996  approximately  1.5  million  personnel  were  serving,  includ- 
ing about  160,000  women.  The  services  are  the  ground  forces, 
the  naval  forces,  the  air  forces,  the  air  defense  forces,  the  stra- 
tegic rocket  forces,  and  the  airborne  troops  (see  fig.  13).  There 
were  plans  to  reduce  the  number  of  armed  services  to  three  by 
combining  the  air  forces,  air  defense  forces,  and  strategic 
rocket  forces  into  a  single  space  force,  but  this  change  had  not 
been  approved  officially  by  mid-1996.  Another  proposed 
change,  aimed  at  improving  cost  and  operational  efficiency, 
would  establish  a  regional  command  structure  that  would 
encompass  ground,  air,  and  naval  forces  in  a  particular  region. 
Altogether,  the  1996  state  budget  authorized  funding  of 
1,470,000  military  personnel  and  600,000  civilian  support  per- 
sonnel. 


524 


The  Armed  Forces 


Command  Structure 

The  armed  forces  chain  of  command  prescribed  in  the  mili- 
tary doctrine  clearly  establishes  central  government  control  of 
the  military.  The  president  of  the  Russian  Federation  is  the 
commander  in  chief.  The  Government  (called  a  council  of 
ministers  or  cabinet  in  other  countries)  is  responsible  for  main- 
taining the  armed  forces  at  the  appropriate  level  of  readiness. 
Direct  leadership  of  the  armed  forces  is  vested  in  the  Ministry 
of  Defense;  the  General  Staff  exercises  operational  control. 

Executive  authority  over  the  military  lies  in  the  office  of  the 
president  of  the  Russian  Federation.  The  State  Duma  exercises 
legislative  authority  through  the  Government.  The  minister  of 
defense  exercises  operational  authority,  and  the  General  Staff 
implements  instructions  and  orders.  This  structure,  which  has 
a  superficial  similarity  to  the  division  of  power  in  the  United 
States  military  establishment,  does  not  imply  military  subordi- 
nation to  civilian  authority  in  the  Western  sense,  however.  The 
historical  tradition  of  military  command  is  considerably  differ- 
ent in  Russia.  The  tsars  were  educated  as  officers,  and  they  reg- 
ularly wore  military  uniforms  and  carried  military  rank.  Stalin 
always  wore  a  military  uniform,  and  he  assumed  the  title  gener- 
alissimo. Even  General  Secretary  Leonid  I.  Brezhnev  (in  office 
1964-82)  appointed  himself  general  of  the  army,  and  he 
encouraged  portraits  of  himself  in  full  uniform. 

By  tradition  dating  back  to  the  tsars,  the  minister  of  defense 
normally  is  a  uniformed  officer.  The  State  Duma  also  seats  a 
large  number  of  deputies  who  are  active-duty  military  offi- 
cers— another  tradition  that  began  in  the  Russian  imperial  era. 
These  combinations  of  military  and  civilian  authority  ensure 
that  military  concerns  are  considered  at  the  highest  levels  of 
the  Russian  government.  They  also  demonstrate  that  strict  sub- 
ordination of  the  military  to  civilian  authority  in  the  Western 
sense  is  neither  a  tradition  nor  a  concern  in  Russia. 

The  minister  of  defense  is  the  nominal  commander  of  all 
the  armed  forces,  serving  under  the  president  of  the  Russian 
Federation.  In  this  capacity,  the  minister  exercises  day-to-day 
authority  over  the  armed  forces.  President  Yeltsin  appointed 
General  of  the  Army  Pavel  Grachev  to  the  post  in  May  1992. 
Grachev's  decision  to  side  with  Yeltsin  in  the  president's  Octo- 
ber 1993  confrontation  with  parliament  deprived  a  rebellious 
State  Duma  of  an  opportunity  to  overturn  the  president's 
authority.  At  least  partly  for  that  reason,  Yeltsin  retained  his 
defense  minister  despite  intense  criticism  of  Grachev's  manage- 


525

ment  of  the  Chechnya  campaign  and  the  Russian  military 
establishment  in  general.  Finally,  victory  in  the  first  round  of 
the  1996  presidential  election  spurred  Yeltsin  to  dismiss 
Grachev;  General  Igor'  Rodionov,  who  had  commanded  troops 
in  the  controversial  occupation  of  Tbilisi  in  1989  but  had  a  rep- 
utation as  a  soldier  of  integrity  who  was  sympathetic  to  reform, 
was  appointed  minister  of  defense  in  July  1996. 

The  Ministry  of  Defense  is  managed  by  a  collegium  of  three 
first  deputy  ministers,  six  deputy  ministers,  and  a  chief  military 
inspector,  who  together  form  the  principal  staff  and  advisory 
board  of  the  minister  of  defense.  The  executive  body  of  the 
Ministry  of  Defense  is  the  General  Staff.  It  is  commanded  by 
the  chief  of  the  General  Staff.  In  keeping  with  the  Soviet  prac- 
tice of  permitting  senior  officers  to  hold  civilian  positions,  in 
1996  the  chief  of  staff  also  was  a  first  deputy  minister  of 
defense. 

Contrary  to  the  United  States  tradition  of  military  authority 
derived  strictly  from  the  civilian  sector,  Russian  General  Staff 
officers  exercise  command  authority  in  their  own  right.  In 
1996  the  General  Staff  included  fifteen  main  directorates  and 
an  undetermined  number  of  operating  agencies.  The  staff  is 
organized  by  functions,  with  each  directorate  and  operating 
agency  overseeing  a  functional  area,  generally  indicated  by  the 
organization's  title  (see  table  28,  Appendix). 

The  most  secret  of  the  General  Staff  directorates  is  the  Main 
Intelligence  Directorate  (Glavnoye  razvedochnoye  uprav- 
leniye — GRU),  which  has  been  an  important  and  closely 


526 


The  Armed  Forces 


guarded  element  of  national  security  since  its  establishment  in 
the  1920s.  The  GRU  system  delivers  detailed  information  on 
the  capabilities  of  Russia's  most  likely  military  adversaries  to 
the  General  Staff  and  to  political  leaders.  The  organization  is 
divided  into  five  operational  directorates,  each  covering  a  des- 
ignated geographical  area.  The  first  four  cover  Europe,  Asia, 
the  Western  Hemisphere  and  Britain,  and  the  Middle  East  and 
Africa,  respectively.  In  the  Soviet  era,  the  fifth  directorate  coor- 
dinated military  intelligence  activities,  but  in  the  1990s  that 
agency  has  been  assigned  to  provide  intelligence  from  the 
other  former  Soviet  republics.  Headquartered  in  Moscow,  the 
GRU  has  an  estimated  2,500  personnel,  including  area  and 
technical  specialists  and  field  offices  abroad.  Each  military  dis- 
trict and  fleet  also  has  its  own  intelligence  directorate. 

Ground  Forces 

The  commander  in  chief  of  the  ground  forces,  who  in  1996 
was  Colonel  General  Valeriy  Patrikeyev  (appointed  in  Septem- 
ber 1992),  has  two  first  deputy  commanders,  three  deputy  com- 
manders, and  a  Main  Staff.  The  first  deputies  have  general 
responsibilities,  and  the  deputies  have  specified  functional 
responsibility  for  armaments,  aviation,  and  combat  training, 
respectively.  The  executive  agency  for  the  commander  in  chief 
is  the  Main  Staff  of  the  Ground  Forces. 

The  Ground  Forces  of  the  Russian  Federation  are  estimated 
to  number  approximately  670,000  officers  and  enlisted  person- 
nel. Of  that  number,  about  170,000  are  contract  volunteer 
enlistees  and  warrant  officers,  and  about  210,000  are  con- 
scripts. Presumably,  the  remaining  290,000  are  commissioned 
officers.  These  figures  indicate  that  43  percent  of  ground 
forces  personnel  are  officers,  an  extraordinarily  high  percent- 
age that  reflects  the  Soviet  and  Russian  tradition  of  giving  little 
authority  to  the  enlisted  ranks,  as  well  as  the  vestiges  of  the 
much  larger  military  cadre  inherited  from  the  Soviet  army. 
Much  of  this  bulge  is  made  up  of  senior  field-grade  officers  and 
generals  who  no  longer  are  needed  in  a  smaller  military  but 
who  are  too  young  to  retire.  In  the  mid-1990s,  this  situation  was 
one  of  the  most  difficult  personnel  problems  facing  the 
ground  forces  command. 

The  ground  forces  are  organized  into  eight  military  districts, 
one  independent  army,  and  two  groups  of  forces  (see  fig.  14; 
fig.  15).  Although  the  districts  are  ground  forces  commands, 
they  may  include  forces  from  the  other  services,  in  which  case 


527

The  Armed  Forces 


they  also  serve  as  regional  commands.  In  February  1996,  four 
of  Russia's  eight  independent  airborne  brigades  were  placed 
under  ground  forces  command,  with  one  each  going  to  the 
North  Caucasus,  Siberian,  Transbaikal,  and  Far  Eastern  dis- 
tricts. At  the  same  time,  two  of  five  airborne  divisions,  stationed 
at  Pskov  and  Novorossiysk,  were  assigned  for  special  joint  oper- 
ations to  the  Northern  and  Siberian  districts,  respectively. 
These  shifts,  which  outside  observers  interpreted  as  the  end  of 
plans  to  form  a  mobile  force  for  rapid  insertion  in  trouble 
areas,  reflected  a  shortage  of  the  airlift  capacity  needed  to  sup- 
port independent  operations  by  such  troops,  as  well  as  a  possi- 
ble fear  of  coup  activity  in  independent  elite  military  units. 

Altogether,  in  1996  the  ground  forces  included  sixty-nine 
divisions:  seventeen  armored,  forty-seven  motorized  infantry, 
and  five  airborne.  Included  in  their  armaments  were  19,000 
main  battle  tanks,  20,000  artillery  pieces,  600  surface-to-surface 
missiles  with  nuclear  capability,  and  about  2,600  attack  and 
transport  helicopters. 

Among  the  specially  designated  units,  the  Operational 
Group  of  Russian  Forces  in  Moldova  (also  known  as  the  Group 
of  Russian  Forces  in  the  Dnestr  Region)  is  part  of  the  ground 
forces,  but  operationally  the  group  is  directly  subordinate  to 
the  Ministry  of  Defense.  This  command  arrangement  probably 
derives  more  from  political  than  military  concerns.  The  second 
force  group,  the  Group  of  Russian  Forces  in  the  Transcaucasus, 
stationed  in  Armenia  and  Georgia,  is  operationally  subordinate 
to  the  ground  forces  command  (see  The  Commonwealth  of 
Independent  States,  this  ch.).  The  Northwest  Group  of  Forces 
is  an  administrative  title  given  to  ground  forces  headquarters  in 
Kaliningrad,  whose  troops  are  under  the  command  of  the  11th 
Independent  Army.  That  army,  in  turn,  is  operationally  subor- 
dinate to  the  ground  forces. 

The  eight  military  districts  are  the  Northern,  Moscow,  Volga, 
North  Caucasus,  Ural,  Siberian,  Transbaikal,  and  Far  Eastern. 
The  Northern  Military  District  is  the  successor  to  the  Soviet-era 
Leningrad  Military  District,  although  the  old  name  still  was  in 
use  in  1995,  and  reports  in  1996  indicated  that  it  might  be  rein- 
stated officially.  The  district  includes  the  6th  Combined  Arms 
Army,  the  30th  Army  Corps,  the  56th  District  Training  Center, 
and  several  smaller  units.  One  air  army  also  is  stationed  in  the 
district,  but  it  appears  to  be  subordinate  to  the  Air  Force  High 
Command.  The  airborne  division  stationed  at  Pskov,  formerly

signed for  special  combined  duty  in  1996. 

The  Moscow  Military  District  is  an  anomaly  in  the  command 
structure  because  it  includes  the  national  capital.  It  has  special 
significance  because  of  its  proximity  to  the  western  border  with 
Belarus  and  Ukraine,  traditionally  the  routes  followed  by  invad- 
ers from  the  west.  The  district's  official  troop  strength  includes 
the  1st  and  22d  combined  arms  armies  and  the  20th  Army 
Corps.  However,  CFE  Treaty  data  indicate  that  operational  con- 
trol of  these  forces  is  vested  in  the  Ministry  of  Defense  rather 
than  the  ground  forces  or  the  district  commanders.  Other 
forces  within  the  Moscow  district  include  the  Moscow  Air 
Defense  District,  one  airborne  brigade,  and  one  brigade  of  spe- 
cial forces  (spetsnaz)  troops.  The  Moscow  Air  Defense  District 
has  boundaries  coterminous  with  those  of  the  Moscow  Military 
District,  but  it  is  under  the  command  of  the  air  defense  forces. 
The  special  forces  brigade  is  directly  subordinate  to  the  Minis- 
try of  Defense. 

The  Volga  Military  District,  headquartered  at  Samara,  is  an 
interior  district  that  includes  the  2d  Combined  Arms  Army, 
together  with  an  airborne  division  that  is  operationally  subordi- 
nate to  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  The  2d  Combined  Arms  Army 
is  an  understrength  unit  consisting  of  the  16th  and  90th  Tank 


530 


The  Armed  Forces 


Divisions.  Also  in  the  Volga  district  are  the  27th  Motorized  Rifle 
Division  and  the  469th  District  Training  Center,  which  are 
directly  subordinate  to  the  district  commander. 

The  North  Caucasus  Military  District,  headquartered  at  Ros- 
tov-na-Donu,  faces  the  former  Soviet  republics  of  Georgia, 
Armenia,  and  Azerbaijan.  It  is  defended  by  the  58th  Combined 
Arms  Army  and  the  8th  and  67th  Army  Corps.  However,  these 
are  not  robust  forces.  The  8th  Army  Corps  and  the  58th  Army 
each  include  only  one  motorized  rifle  division,  and  the  67th 
Army  Corps  has  only  reserve  forces  with  no  heavy  equipment. 
The  weakness  of  these  units  has  helped  motivate  Russian  pro- 
posals to  renegotiate  CFE  Treaty  limitations  to  allow  additional 
forces  along  Russia's  southern  flank. 

The  Ural  Military  District  lies  south  of  the  Northern  district 
and  east  of  the  Ural  Mountains,  with  the  Siberian  district  to  its 
east.  The  Ural  district,  whose  headquarters  is  at  Yekaterinburg, 
includes  two  tank  divisions  and  two  motorized  rifle  divisions. 
The  Siberian  Military  District  lies  in  the  center  of  Asiatic  Rus- 
sia, with  its  headquarters  in  Novosibirsk.  Its  ground  forces  are 
organized  into  one  corps  of  four  motorized  rifle  divisions  and 
one  artillery  regiment. 

The  Transbaikal  Military  District  is  headquartered  in  Chita. 
The  district  comprises  three  combined  arms  armies  totaling 
four  tank  divisions  and  six  motorized  rifle  divisions.  One  tank 
division  and  one  motorized  rifle  division  are  headquartered  at 
district  training  centers  that  are  believed  to  be  directly  subordi- 
nate to  the  district  headquarters.  One  artillery  division  and  two 
machine  gun-artillery  divisions  deployed  on  the  Chinese  bor- 
der also  have  district  training-center  status. 

The  Far  Eastern  Military  District,  headquartered  in  Kha- 
barovsk, includes  four  combined  arms  armies  and  one  army 
corps.  Among  them,  those  units  have  three  tank  divisions  and 
thirteen  motorized  rifle  divisions,  of  which  one  tank  division 
and  two  motorized  rifle  divisions  have  headquarters  that  serve 
as  district  training  centers.  One  artillery  division  and  five 
machine  gun-artillery  divisions  are  directly  subordinate  to  the 
district  headquarters. 

Naval  Forces 

The  naval  forces  include  about  200,000  sailors  and  marines, 
about  20  percent  of  whom  are  conscripts,  and  500,000  reserves. 
Of  the  active-duty  personnel,  about  30,000  are  in  naval  aviation 
and  24,000  in  coastal  defense  forces.  The  primary  missions  of 


531 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

the  naval  forces  are  to  provide  strategic  nuclear  deterrence 
from  the  nuclear  submarine  fleet  and  to  defend  the  sea-lanes 
approaching  the  Russian  coast.  The  naval  forces  include  shore- 
based  troops,  naval  aviation  units,  four  fleets,  and  one  flotilla 
(see  fig.  16).  The  shore-based  forces  and  naval  aviation  forces 
are  operationally  subordinate  to  the  fleets.  The  strategic  naval 
forces,  comprising  forty-five  nuclear  submarines  and  13,000 
personnel,  are  operationally  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of 
Defense  and  logistically  supported  by  the  fleets  in  whose  ports 
they  are  based.  Some  138  other  submarines  are  in  service, 
although  in  the  mid-1990s  a  major  reduction  of  the  nonstrate- 
gic  submarine  force  was  in  progress  (see  table  29,  Appendix). 

In  the  mid-1990s,  Russia's  naval  aviation  force  was  almost 
entirely  shore  based,  after  having  achieved  substantial  sea- 
based  strike  capability  in  the  Soviet  era.  In  1996  only  the  steam- 
powered  aircraft  carrier  Admiral  Kuznetsov,  assigned  to  the 
Northern  Fleet,  conducted  active  flight  operations  at  sea.  Two 
new  nuclear-powered  carriers  were  scrapped  before  comple- 
tion, indicating  abandonment  of  that  program,  and  older  air- 
craft-carrying cruisers  were  sold  to  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea)  for  scrap.  However,  in  1996  the  nuclear-pow- 
ered cruiser  Petr  Velikiy  (Peter  the  Great)  was  scheduled  for 
launching  at  St.  Petersburg  after  eight  years  under  construc- 
tion; assigned  to  the  Pacific  Fleet,  the  28,000-ton  vessel  is 
armed  with  guided  missiles  believed  to  be  designed  to  destroy 
enemy  aircraft  carriers.  Experts  rated  the  Petr  Velikiy  the  most 
powerful  cruiser  in  the  world. 

Each  of  Russia's  four  fleets  has  a  subordinate,  land-based 
naval  air  force.  The  Caspian  Flotilla  has  no  naval  air  arm.  The 
naval  shore-based  troops  consist  of  naval  infantry  and  coastal 
defense  forces.  The  naval  infantry  forces  include  one  infantry 
division  subordinate  to  the  Pacific  Fleet  and  four  naval  infantry 
brigades — one  in  the  Baltic  Fleet,  one  in  the  Black  Sea  Fleet, 
and  two  in  the  Northern  Fleet.  The  coastal  defense  forces  are  a 
combination  of  infantry  regiments,  brigades,  and  divisions  with 
air  defense  missile  regiments.  Amphibious  landings  are  a  low 
priority;  according  to  intelligence  estimates,  only  2,500 
marines  and  100  tanks  could  be  put  ashore  by  Russia's  thirteen 
amphibious  ships.  According  to  a  Russian  source,  in  1996  most 
ships  were  at  a  relatively  low  readiness  level,  with  most  units 
remaining  close  to  home  port. 

The  Northern  Fleet  is  headquartered  at  Severomorsk,  at  the 
top  of  the  Kola  Peninsula  near  Murmansk,  with  additional 


532 


The  Armed  Forces 


home  ports  at  Kola,  Motovskiy,  Gremikha,  and  Ura  Guba.  The 
mission  of  the  Northern  Fleet  is  to  defend  Russia's  far  north- 
western Arctic  region  surrounding  the  Kola  Peninsula.  The 
fleet  provides  home  ports  for  thirty-seven  nuclear  submarines, 
twenty-two  other  submarines,  forty-seven  principal  surface 
combatants,  and  ten  coastal  and  smaller  ships.  The  naval  avia- 
tion contingent  includes  a  complement  of  twenty  Su-39  fixed- 
wing  aircraft  and  ten  antisubmarine  warfare  helicopters  on 
board  the  Admiral  Kuznetsov,  which  heads  the  air  defense  of  the 
Barents  Sea.  Shore-based  naval  aviation  includes  200  combat 
aircraft  and  sixty-four  helicopters.  The  Northern  Fleet  has  two 
naval  infantry  brigades,  one  coastal  defense  regiment,  and  an 
air  defense  missile  regiment. 

The  Baltic  Fleet  is  headquartered  in  Kaliningrad,  where  it  is 
defended  by  a  naval  infantry  brigade.  From  this  rather  exposed 
location,  the  fleet  controls  naval  bases  at  Kronshtadt  and  Bal- 
tiysk.  Operational  forces  include  nine  submarines,  twenty-three 
principal  surface  combatants,  and  approximately  sixty-five 
smaller  vessels.  The  air  arm  of  the  Baltic  Fleet  includes  five  reg- 
iments of  combat  aircraft  and  a  number  of  other  fixed-wing  air- 
craft and  helicopters. 

Headquartered  at  Sevastopol',  with  an  additional  home  port 
in  Odessa,  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  became  an  object  of  contention 
between  Russia  and  Ukraine  when  the  latter  republic  achieved 
independence  after  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union. 
Although  Ukraine  has  no  use  for  a  blue-water  navy  and  cannot 
afford  to  maintain  one,  it  has  been  reluctant  to  surrender  its 
share  of  the  fleet,  both  of  whose  home  ports  are  in  Ukraine,  to 
a  larger  neighbor  with  a  tradition  of  domination.  A  long  inter- 
national squabble  ended  temporarily  when  ajune  1995  summit 
meeting  arrived  at  a  formula  for  disposition  of  the  Black  Sea 
Fleet's  assets:  the  ships  of  the  fleet  were  to  be  divided  equally 
between  the  two  nations,  but  Russia  eventually  would  buy  back 
approximately  60  percent  of  Ukraine's  share.  The  Russian  por- 
tion of  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  continued  to  be  based  in  Sevasto- 
pol', with  separate  Russian  and  Ukrainian  ports  designated  on 
the  coast.  All  ships  were  to  be  under  dual  command  until  the 
agreement  took  effect  in  1998.  However,  substantial  nationalist 
opinion  on  the  Russian  side  opposed  this  solution. 

The  Black  Sea  Fleet  comprises  fourteen  submarines,  thirty- 
one  capital  ships  of  the  line,  and  forty-one  coastal  ships.  The 
Moskva,  Russia's  first  seagoing  aircraft  cruiser,  is  assigned  to  the 
Black  Sea  Fleet.  It  is  an  antisubmarine  warfare  helicopter  car-

rier  with  a  complement  of  eighteen  KA-25  helicopters.  The 
land  component  of  the  Black  Sea  Fleet  comprises  one  naval 
infantry  brigade,  a  coastal  defense  division,  and  a  surface-to-air 
missile  (SAM)  regiment.  It  is  not  known  how  these  assets  will 
be  distributed  between  Russia  and  Ukraine.  The  naval  aviation 
component  of  the  fleet  includes  an  inventory  of  nearly  8,000 
aircraft  of  all  types.  Its  strike  power  is  concentrated  in  a 
bomber  regiment  and  a  mixed  fighter  and  ground-attack  regi- 
ment. 

The  Caspian  Flotilla  is  a  small  force  for  coastal  defense  and 
waterways  patrol  consisting  of  two  frigates,  twelve  patrol  boats, 
and  about  fifty  other  small  craft  based  in  Astrakhan'.  Com- 
mand and  equipment  are  shared  with  Azerbaijan  and  Kazak- 
stan,  other  former  Soviet  republics  on  the  Caspian  littoral. 

The  Pacific  Fleet  and  the  Northern  Fleet  are  rated  as  the  two 
most  powerful  Russian  naval  forces.  Pacific  Fleet  headquarters 
is  in  Vladivostok,  with  additional  home  ports  in  Petropavlovsk- 
Kamchatskiy,  Magadan,  and  Sovetskaya  Gavan'.  The  Pacific 
Fleet  includes  eighteen  nuclear  submarines  that  are  operation- 
ally subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Defense  and  based  at  Pav- 
lovsk  and  Rybachiy.  The  blue-water  striking  power  of  the 
Pacific  Fleet  lies  in  thirty-four  nonnuclear  submarines  and 
forty-nine  principal  surface  combatants. 

The  air  power  of  the  Pacific  Fleet  consists  of  the  250  combat 
aircraft  and  helicopters  of  the  Pacific  Fleet  Air  Force,  all  of 
which  are  land-based.  Its  most  powerful  strike  force  is  two 
bomber  regiments  stationed  at  Alekseyevka.  Each  regiment 


534 


The  Armed  Forces 


consists  of  thirty  supersonic  Tu-26  Backfire  aircraft.  The  land 
power  of  the  Pacific  Fleet  consists  of  one  naval  infantry  division 
and  a  coastal  defense  division.  The  naval  infantry  division 
includes  more  than  half  of  the  total  manpower  in  the  Russian 
naval  infantry.  Following  the  pattern  established  elsewhere  in 
the  naval  infantry,  in  the  mid-1990s  the  Pacific  Fleet  infantry  is 
expected  to  be  reorganized  into  brigades  in  the  near  future. 

Air  Forces 

The  air  forces  include  about  130,000  troops,  of  which  40,000 
are  conscripts.  According  to  CFE  Treaty  figures,  at  the  end  of 
1994  Russia's  air  forces,  including  air  defense,  possessed  a  total 
of  3,283  combat  aircraft.  The  air  forces  are  organized  into  four 
commands  under  the  Air  Force  High  Command  (see  fig.  17). 
These  commands  are  the  Long-Range  Aviation  Command,  the 
Frontal  Aviation  Command,  the  Military  Transport  Aviation 
Command,  and  the  Reserve  and  Cadre  Training  Command. 
The  usual  command  configuration  includes  a  division  of  three 
regiments,  each  with  three  squadrons  of  aircraft,  plus  indepen- 
dent regiments.  Like  units  of  the  ground  forces,  most  air  force 
units  are  deployed  according  to  military  district. 

The  air  force  contingent  of  the  Far  Eastern  Military  District 
consists  of  124  Su-24  Fencer  bombers  of  the  long-range  avia- 
tion force,  and  245  ground-attack  and  fighter  aircraft  of  the 
Su-17,  Su-24,  Su-25,  Su-27,  and  MiG-29  classes  in  frontal  avia- 
tion. The  Transbaikal  Military  District  hosts  an  air  army  com- 
prising 185  combat  aircraft.  The  long-range  contingent  in  that 
district  consists  of  eighty  Su-24  bombers.  The  frontal  aviation 
portion  includes  thirty  MiG-29  and  seventy-five  Su-17  and  Su- 
24  ground-attack  and  dual-role  aircraft. 

The  Siberian  Military  District  has  no  frontal  or  long-range 
assets.  It  deploys  only  239  L-39  jet  training  aircraft  of  the 
Reserve  and  Cadre  Training  Command.  The  Ural  Military  Dis- 
trict is  supported  by  one  regiment  of  thirty  Su-24  fighter- 
bombers  of  the  Frontal  Aviation  Command.  The  North  Cauca- 
sus Military  District's  air  assets  are  organized  as  an  air  army  that 
includes  a  long-range  bomber  division  of  eighty-five  Su-24 
bombers,  together  with  two  frontal  aviation  divisions,  a  ground- 
attack  division  of  110  Su-25  fighter-bombers,  and  a  fighter  divi- 
sion of  110  MiG-29  fighters.  The  North  Caucasus  Military  Dis- 
trict air  army  also  has  a  reconnaissance  regiment  consisting  of 
thirty-five  Su-24  aircraft.

Two  training  centers  of  the  Reserve  and  Cadre  Training 
Command  are  located  in  the  North  Caucasus  district.  They 
base  five  training  regiments  equipped  with  500  operational  and 
training  aircraft  of  various  types.  Two  more  fighter  training  reg- 
iments deploying  a  combination  of  ninety-four  combat  aircraft 
are  stationed  in  the  Volga  Military  District.  The  Moscow  Mili- 
tary District  is  supported  by  an  air  army  that  consists  of  a 
bomber  division  of  ninety  Su-24  aircraft  of  the  Long-Range 
Aviation  Command,  a  fighter  division  of  145  Su-27  and  MiG- 
29  aircraft,  a  ground-attack  regiment  of  forty  Su-25  fighters, 
and  a  reconnaissance  regiment  of  fifty-five  Su-24  and  MiG-25 
aircraft.  The  Moscow  Military  District  also  hosts  two  training 
regiments  of  the  Reserve  and  Cadre  Training  Command. 

The  Northern  Military  District  is  supported  by  an  air  army 
consisting  of  a  bomber  division  under  the  Long-Range  Aviation 
Command  and  a  fighter  division  and  a  reconnaissance  regi- 
ment under  the  Frontal  Aviation  Command.  The  bomber  divi- 
sion is  equipped  with  eighty  Su-24  bombers,  the  fighter 
division  with  ninety-five  Su-27  and  MiG-29  aircraft. 

In  addition  to  the  allocations  made  by  district,  forty-six  air- 
craft officially  belong  to  the  Long-Range  Aviation  Command 
but  are  under  the  control  of  Ukraine.  Their  operational  readi- 
ness is  suspect.  A  composite  regiment  of  transport  aircraft  and 


536 


The  Armed  Forces 


helicopters  from  the  Military  Transport  Aviation  Command  is 
stationed  at  Kaliningrad. 

The  Military  Transport  Aviation  Command  is  organized  into 
three  divisions,  each  comprising  three  regiments  of  thirty  air- 
craft. In  addition,  there  are  a  few  independent  aviation  trans- 
port regiments,  including  one  stationed  in  Kaliningrad. 
Overall,  the  independent  training  regiments  deploy  about  350 
aircraft  of  the  11—76  Kandid,  An-12,  An-22,  and  An-124  types. 

Strategic  aviation  is  an  intercontinental  nuclear  strike  force 
that  includes  about  15,000  personnel.  In  concert  with  the  stra- 
tegic rocket  forces,  it  provides  the  Russian  Federation's  strate- 
gic nuclear  threat.  Organizationally,  strategic  aviation  falls 
under  the  Long-Range  Aviation  Command  of  the  air  forces, 
but  it  is  under  the  operational  control  of  the  Ministry  of 
Defense.  Bases  are  located  in  the  Far  Eastern,  Moscow,  and 
Northern  military  districts.  According  to  the  reckoning  of 
START  I,  strategic  aviation  aircraft  can  deliver  a  total  of  1,506 
nuclear  warheads,  including  bombs,  cruise  missiles,  and  air-to- 
surface  missiles.  The  Far  Eastern  force  deploys  107  Tu-95  Bear 
bombers  of  the  G  and  H  models  and  twenty  Tu-160  Blackjack 
bombers. 

The  Bear  is  a  long-range  subsonic  turboprop  bomber  mod- 
eled after  the  United  States  B-29  of  World  War  II  vintage. 
Although  still  serviceable,  it  is  an  obsolete  combat  aircraft  by 
modern  military  standards.  Its  operational  range  would  carry  it 
over  the  United  States,  however.  The  Blackjack  is  a  modern, 
high-performance  aircraft  that  has  a  shorter  range  than  the 
Bear.  The  Blackjack  can  reach  long-range  targets  in  the  United 
States  with  the  aid  of  midair  refueling.  For  this  purpose,  the 
strategic  bomber  force  has  forty  tanker  aircraft  in  its  inventory. 

The  Northern  and  Moscow  military  districts  each  house  a 
heavy  bomber  regiment  of  twenty  modern  Tu-22M  high-per- 
formance jet  bombers.  The  Tu-22M  has  less  range  than  the 
older  Tu-95  models,  but  it  is  better  suited  to  modern  air  war- 
fare. According  to  experts,  the  Bears  are  located  in  Asia 
because  they  match  China's  obsolete  air  defenses,  and  the 
more  modern  aircraft  are  in  Europe  to  be  matched  against  the 
more  formidable  West  European  defenses. 

Air  Defense  Forces 

The  air  defense  forces,  charged  with  defense  against  enemy 
air  attack,  have  a  total  of  about  200,000  troops,  of  whom  60,000 
are  conscripts.  The  air  defense  forces  include  missile,  air  force, 


537 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

and  radio-technical  units  and  an  air  defense  army.  There  also 
are  two  independent  air  defense  corps  (see  fig.  18).  The  missile 
forces  are  equipped  with  approximately  2,500  launchers 
deployed  in  about  250  different  sites  around  the  country.  Air 
defense  forces  have  particular  responsibility  for  defending 
administrative  and  industrial  centers;  for  instance,  they  sur- 
round Moscow  with  about  100  missile  launchers.  The  air  force 
troop  contingent  consists  of  about  850  combat  aircraft,  includ- 
ing 100  MiG-23,  425  MiG-31,  and  325  Su-27  aircraft. 

The  air  defense  forces  also  operate  twenty  11-76  aircraft  con- 
figured for  airborne  early  warning  and  command  and  control. 
The  air  force  troops  operate  their  own  training  program  from 
one  training  center  that  includes  four  regiments  equipped  with 
more  than  380  MiG-23  and  L-39  aircraft. 

The  missile  troops  are  equipped  with  about  150  SA-2  Guide- 
line, 100  SA-3  Goa,  500  SA-5  Gammon,  and  1,750  SA-10 
Grumble  missile  launchers.  A  program  to  replace  all  of  the 
older  systems  with  the  SA-10,  well  under  way  by  1996,  has  been 
considered  by  experts  to  be  one  of  the  most  successful  reequip- 
ment  programs  of  the  post-Soviet  armed  forces.  Seven  of  the 
military  districts  have  at  least  one  aviation  air  defense  regiment 
each;  two  districts,  Moscow  and  the  Far  Eastern,  have  specially 
designated  air  defense  districts. 

The  borders  of  the  Moscow  Air  Defense  District  are  the  same 
as  those  of  the  Moscow  Military  District.  The  Far  Eastern  Air 
Defense  District  combines  the  territory  of  the  Far  Eastern  Mili- 
tary District  and  the  Transbaikal  Military  District.  Presumably, 
the  boundaries  of  the  other  military  districts  are  the  same  for 
air  defense  as  for  other  defense  designations. 

Strategic  Rocket  Forces 

In  the  Soviet  era,  the  strategic  rocket  forces  (SRF)  were 
established  as  the  elite  service  of  the  nation's  military  because 
they  have  the  vital  mission  of  operating  long-  and  medium- 
range  missiles  with  nuclear  warheads.  They  remained  so  in  the 
mid-1990s.  In  1996  the  SRF  had  about  100,000  troops,  of  which 
about  half  were  conscripts;  the  SRF  has  the  highest  proportion 
of  well-educated  officers  among  the  armed  services.  The  SRF 
also  is  the  only  service  with  an  active  force  modernization  pro- 
gram. 

Russia's  report  for  the  GFE  Treaty  indicated  the  existence  of 
ten  SRF  missile  bases  within  the  European  scope  of  the  treaty, 
including  sites  at  Plesetsk  (north  of  Moscow),  Kapustin  Yar 


538 


The  Armed  Forces 


(near  Volgograd),  Vladimir  (east  of  Moscow),  Vypolzovo 
(northwest  of  Moscow),  Yoshkar  Ola  (in  the  Republic  of  Mari 
El),  Kozel'sk  (southwest  of  Moscow),  Tatishchevo  (north  of  Vol- 
gograd), Teykovo  (northeast  of  Moscow),  and  Surovatikha 
(south  of  Nizhniy  Novgorod).  Indicating  the  priority  given  air 
defense  of  the  European  sector,  Russia  listed  only  four  addi- 
tional missile  bases  outside  the  CFE  Treaty  reporting  area,  at 
Nizhniy  Tagil,  Irkutsk,  Novosibirsk,  and  Kansk.  There  is  a  train- 
ing regiment  at  the  missile  test  facility  near  Plesetsk  and 
another  at  the  Kapustin  Yar  test  facility.  Russia  has  continued 
the  reduction  in  strategic  missile  inventory  required  under 
START  I,  although  at  a  pace  slower  than  the  United  States 
would  like.  By  mid-1996  all  nuclear  warheads  on  former  Soviet 
SRF  missiles  in  Kazakstan  and  Ukraine  had  been  returned  to 
Russia  or  destroyed,  and  all  missiles  were  scheduled  to  leave 
Belarus  by  the  end  of  1996  (see  Nuclear  Arms  Issues,  this  ch.). 

The  Russian  SRF  missile  inventory  not  only  is  shrinking  in 
response  to  treaty  requirements  but  also  is  changing  in  charac- 
ter. The  new  SS-25  Topol  is  the  only  system  suited  to  Russian 
strategic  requirements  and  acceptable  under  the  requirements 
of  START  I,  so  rocket  production  efforts  will  concentrate  on 
this  model  for  the  foreseeable  future. 

The  Topol  is  fielded  in  SRF  regiments  comprising  three  bat- 
talions totaling  nine  launch  vehicles.  In  1996  forty  such  regi- 
ments were  operational.  Several  older  operational  ICBM 
systems  also  remained  in  the  field.  These  included  an  SS-17 
regiment  of  ten  silos,  six  SS-18  silo  fields  totaling  222  missiles 
with  multiple  warheads,  four  SS-19  silo  fields  totaling  250  mis- 
siles with  multiple  warheads,  and  ninety-two  SS-24  missiles  of 
which  thirty-six  are  mounted  on  trains.  All  except  the  SS-24 
were  being  phased  out  in  favor  of  the  SS-25  Topol.  Two 
remaining  SS-25  regiments  without  warheads  were  scheduled 
for  redeployment  from  Belarus  to  the  Perm'  region  in  1996. 

Airborne  Troops 

The  airborne  troops  comprise  five  airborne  divisions  and 
eight  air  assault  brigades.  They  were  designated  as  a  separate 
service  in  1991,  at  which  time  the  air  assault  brigades  were  reas- 
signed from  ground  forces  units  and  military  districts  to  Air- 
borne Troop  Headquarters,  with  direct  responsibility  to  the 
Ministry  of  Defense.  The  justification  for  this  reorganization 
was  that  airborne  troops  could  not  respond  as  quickly  to  an 
emergency  under  ground  forces  command  as  they  could  as  a

separate  command.  Experts  believe  that  the  decision  to  reorga- 
nize came  mainly  in  response  to  internal  politics  rather  than 
military  necessity;  at  that  time,  the  Russian  national  leadership 
did  not  want  airborne  troops  under  the  control  of  the  General 
Staff  or  the  ground  forces.  In  early  1996,  four  of  the  eight  inde- 
pendent airborne  brigades  and  two  of  the  five  airborne  divi- 
sions were  placed  under  the  command  of  their  respective 
district  commanders,  and  the  remaining  three  divisions 
became  part  of  the  strategic  reserve.  The  command  adjust- 
ments constituted  a  return  to  the  pre-1991  arrangement. 

The  reason  given  for  the  transfer  of  authority  was  that  the 
military  districts  already  controlled  the  helicopter,  fixed-wing, 
and  other  resources  needed  to  support  the  air  assault  brigades, 
and  that  historically  air  assault  brigades  were  created  to  oper- 
ate in  an  operational-tactical  role  attached  to  a  high-level  head- 
quarters. They  were  never  intended  to  be  a  strategic  asset.  In 
the  case  of  the  Novorossiysk  Division  engaged  in  Chechnya,  a 
chain  of  command  running  back  to  Moscow  allegedly  proved 
unworkable.  However,  the  reassignment  of  the  airborne  units 
brought  interservice  charges  that  the  move  was  an  attempt  to 
rein  in  a  service  branch  perceived  as  having  a  dangerous  com- 
bination of  independence  and  mobility.  The  chief  of  the  Gen- 
eral Staff,  General  Mikhail  Kolesnikov,  characterized  the 
decision  as  purely  operational. 

The  mission  of  the  airborne  forces  is  to  make  possible  a 
quick  response  to  national  emergencies.  The  airborne  troops 


540 


The  Armed  Forces 


are  considered  an  elite  force  because  they  are  individually 
selected  from  volunteers  based  on  physical  fitness,  intelligence, 
and  loyalty.  By  traditional  military  standards,  the  airborne 
troops  are  not  a  powerful  force.  Each  division  is  assigned  about 
6,000  lightly  armed  troops  with  lightly  armored  vehicles.  Their 
value  is  that  they  have  special  training  and  have  operational 
and  strategic  mobility  provided  by  long-range  aircraft.  Their 
parachute  assault  capability  means  that  they  can  be  deployed 
anywhere  within  airlift  range  in  a  matter  of  hours  without  the 
need  for  an  air  base  in  friendly  hands.  However,  resupply  and 
support  by  heavy  ground  troop  formations  are  necessary  in  a 
matter  of  days  because  the  airborne  troops  lack  the  self-sustain- 
ing combat  and  logistical  power  of  regular  ground  forces. 

All  of  the  airborne  divisions  are  based  in  European  Russia. 
One  division  is  based  in  the  Northern  Military  District,  two  in 
the  Moscow  Military  District,  and  one  each  in  the  Volga  and 
North  Caucasus  districts.  The  division  in  the  North  Caucasus 
Military  District  has  taken  part  in  the  Chechnya  conflict. 

The  eight  airborne  assault  brigades  are  smaller  than  divi- 
sions, and  they  lack  the  armor  and  artillery  assets  that  give  con- 
ventional divisions  ground  mobility  and  firepower.  Once  the 
airborne  brigades  are  on  the  ground,  they  can  move  no  faster 
than  walking  speed.  Their  role  is  primarily  focused  on  helicop- 
ter operations,  but  they  also  are  trained  for  parachute  assault 
from  fixed-wing  aircraft. 

Performance 

In  the  1990s,  the  direction  of  change  in  the  Russian  armed 
forces  is  toward  a  smaller  and  more  defense-oriented  force 
almost  entirely  deployed  within  the  borders  of  Russia.  As  of 
mid-1996,  that  change  was  occurring  faster  than  military  or 
civilian  leaders  could  manage.  The  result  was  a  large  armed 
force  with  too  many  officers  and  not  enough  enlisted  person- 
nel, one  unable  to  provide  adequate  training,  and,  according 
to  Russian  and  Western  experts,  deficient  in  purpose  and  direc- 
tion. The  military  leadership  remained  in  the  hands  of  hold- 
overs from  the  Soviet  regime  who  had  failed  to  adjust  to  new 
political  and  military  realities.  The  force's  one  strength  lay  in 
the  sheer  numbers  of  its  personnel  and  the  size  of  its  equip- 
ment inventory. 

The  performance  of  Russia's  armed  forces  in  the  Chechnya 
conflict  provided  a  glimpse  of  the  capabilities  of  Russian 


541

ground  and  air  forces.  The  image  is  not  an  impressive  one,  par- 
ticularly if  evidence  on  training  and  force  morale  is  considered. 

Troop  Support  Elements 

The  social  implications  of  Russia's  troop  support  effort  in 
the  mid-1990s  are  staggering.  In  the  United  States,  a  lack  of 
military  housing  means  that  military  families  have  to  find 
homes  or  apartments  in  the  civilian  community.  Because  that 
option  does  not  exist  in  Russia,  a  military  family  without  mili- 
tary housing  is  literally  homeless.  Families  of  field-grade  offi- 
cers subsist  in  tents  or  packing  crates  salvaged  from  troop 
redeployments  from  Central  Europe.  In  other  cases,  homeless 
military  families  have  been  sheltered  for  years  at  a  time  in  gym- 
nasiums or  warehouses  set  up  like  emergency  shelters.  At  the 
end  of  1994,  an  estimated  280,000  military  personnel  and  fam- 
ily members  were  homeless.  Many  units  live  in  permanent  field 
conditions  under  canvas.  In  1995  only  2,500  of  5,000  rated 
pilots  in  flight-status  jobs  had  apartments.  The  elite  strategic 
rocket  forces  (SRF)  have  not  fared  much  better  than  the  other 
branches  of  the  armed  forces.  In  1995  the  SRF  commander  in 
chief,  General  Igor'  Sergeyev,  stated  that  only  fourteen  of  forty- 
two  apartment  blocks  needed  in  1994  to  house  his  troops  and 
their  families  had  been  constructed,  leaving  11,000  of  his 
troops  unhoused;  one  year  later,  4,000  of  his  troops  still  were 
without  housing.  In  1996  the  overall  housing  situation  wors- 
ened. 

The  impact  on  military  preparedness  is  immense.  The  daily 
lives  of  officers  and  enlisted  personnel  are  consumed  with  pro- 
viding the  means  of  survival  for  themselves  and  their  families. 
This  marginal  existence  provides  ferule  ground  for  illegal  activ- 
ities such  as  trading  military  property  for  means  of  sustenance, 
or  engaging  in  illicit  acts  to  obtain  money  earned,  but  not 
received,  in  pay  (see  Crime  in  the  Military,  this  ch.).  There  is 
little  energy,  time,  funds,  materiel,  or  even  motivation  to  con- 
duct individual  or  small-unit  training. 

Soldiers  often  wait  two  to  four  months  to  be  paid,  and  often 
only  partial  pay  is  issued.  According  to  a  complex  financial  sys- 
tem, Russian  commercial  banks  have  responsibility  for  issuing 
funds  from  the  Ministry  of  Defense's  budget  account  to  individ- 
uals, but  the  system  has  proved  extremely  cumbersome,  and 
substantial  amounts  of  money  have  simply  disappeared  or  have 
been  long  delayed  while  being  processed.  The  pay  level  also  is 
unsatisfactory.  In  early  1996,  a  Russian  pilot  holding  the  rank 


542 


MiG-29K Fulcrum  naval  variant  armed  with  missiles,  on  display  at 

1992  Moscow  Air  Show 

of  major  was  paid  approximately  1.5  million  rubles  per  month, 
or  about  US$300.  By  comparison,  a  NATO  pilot  of  equivalent 
rank  earned  US$6,000  per  month. 

Force  readiness  also  depends  on  equipment  maintenance 
and  resupply.  In  1995  aviation  units  received  only  39  percent  of 
the  required  fuel,  reducing  annual  flight  time  by  a  factor  of 
3.5.  In  1994  the  Ministry  of  Defense  purchased  only  thirty  of 
the  300  aircraft  listed  as  being  required,  and  only  one  aircraft 
was  purchased  in  1995.  General  Petr  Deynekin,  air  forces  com- 
mander in  chief,  has  estimated  that,  at  that  rate  of  acquisition 
and  maintenance,  the  air  forces  would  have  no  flyable  aircraft 
by  2005. 

The  naval  forces  are  in  approximately  the  same  state  of 
readiness  as  the  air  forces.  Only  one  ship,  the  aircraft  carrier 
Admiral  Kuznetsov,  had  as  much  as  five  months  of  time  at  sea  in 


543 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

1994.  Other  naval  sea  time  training  was  described  as  "infre- 
quent." In  1995  nearly  95  percent  of  the  ready  naval  vessels 
remained  at  dockside  because  of  shortages  of  fuel,  ammuni- 
tion, and  crews,  and  a  backlog  of  repairs.  Fuel  shortages  have 
caused  the  Pacific  Fleet  to  cancel  visits  by  single  ships  to  Asian 
ports,  and  electricity  was  cut  off  to  a  nuclear  submarine  base  in 
the  Kola  Peninsula,  nearly  causing  a  serious  nuclear  accident, 
because  the  base  could  not  pay  its  bills.  The  Black  Sea  Fleet  was 
embarrassed  when  a  cruiser  in  the  Mediterranean  in  1996  ran 
out  of  water  and  had  to  request  emergency  resupply  from  the 
United  States  Navy.  The  once-proud  aircraft  carrier  Admiral 
Gorshkov,  the  last  of  the  Kiev  class  in  service,  was  in  drydock  in 
1996  for  repair  after  a  serious  fire,  and  there  were  proposals  to 
sell  the  ship  for  scrap  or  to  the  Indian  navy. 

Naval  logistics  had  reached  a  crisis  state  by  the  mid-1990s.  In 
1996  fuel  allocations  were  reduced  by  65  percent  from  1995, 
and  rations  were  cut  by  60  percent.  Similar  cuts  were  made  in 
funds  for  maintenance,  parts,  tools,  and  batteries.  The  result 
was  that  fleet  readiness  was  reduced  by  an  estimated  30  percent 
for  coastal  forces  and  50  percent  for  the  blue-water  navy. 

Russia's  four  Kirov-class  nuclear  cruisers  have  fallen  into  dis- 
use because  they  require  large  crews  and  are  expensive  to  oper- 
ate. Of  the  ships  in  that  category,  the  Ushakov  had  been  at 
dockside  in  its  home  port,  Murmansk,  for  nearly  five  years  in 
1996  because  of  a  lack  of  spare  parts.  The  Petr  Velikiy  began  sea 
trials  in  1996  after  a  delay  of  three  years.  The  Lazarev  was  sched- 
uled to  be  refueled  in  1996,  but  scrapping  also  was  considered. 
Conventionally  powered  ships  also  have  experienced  mainte- 
nance difficulties.  The  Slava-class  Marshal  Ustinov  was  in  dry- 
dock  in  St.  Petersburg  for  two  years  for  refurbishing,  but  it  was 
expected  to  be  scrapped  for  lack  of  parts  and  funds. 

The  air  defense  forces  also  have  found  it  difficult  to  main- 
tain readiness.  In  February  1996,  the  commander  in  chief, 
General  Viktor  Prudnikov,  admitted  that  inadequate  funding 
and  poor  materiel  and  technical  support  had  lowered  his 
branch's  standard  of  combat  readiness.  Russia's  missile  forces 
receive  no  systematic  daily  training,  and  there  is  no  firing- 
range  practice.  Air  defense  pilots  get  little  flight  time,  and  no 
funds  are  available  for  maintenance  or  aircraft  parts.  An  esti- 
mated 50  percent  of  Russia's  border  is  unprotected  by  radar 
because  equipment  of  the  radio-technical  forces  is  inoperable. 
As  of  1996,  the  air  defense  forces  had  not  had  funds  for  new 


544 


AS- 14  Kedge  air-to-surface  missile  on  display  at  1992

orders  for  two  years,  and  no  improvement  was  expected  in  the 
near  future. 

The  readiness  condition  of  the  ground  forces  is  comparable 
to  that  of  the  other  branches.  In  1994  General  Vladimir 
Semenov,  commander  in  chief  of  the  ground  forces,  admitted 
that  the  ground  forces  lacked  the  capacity  to  perform  their 
assigned  tasks.  The  council  reported  that  more  than  a  third  of 
the  helicopters  cannot  fly  and  that  even  emergency  supplies 
(war  stocks)  had  been  partially  consumed.  General  Semenov 
has  reported  that  ground  forces  units  are  drastically  under- 
staffed; motorized  rifle  regiments,  the  heart  of  ground  combat 
power,  are  said  to  be  understaffed  by  60  percent.  Semenov  has 
concluded  that  Russian  ground  combat  units  lack  adequate 
personnel  to  participate  in  military  actions  and  that  full  staff- 
ing of  units  would  take  a  prohibitively  long  time. 

Crime  in  the  Military 

By  the  mid-1990s,  both  organized  and  random  crime  had 
penetrated  Russia's  military,  as  they  had  penetrated  many 
other  parts  of  society.  As  the  military  reorganizes,  personnel 
are  faced  with  strong  temptations  to  engage  in  criminal  activity, 


545 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

particularly  when  valuable  state  property  is  available  for  sale 
and  when  the  professional  prospects  and  social  prestige  of  mili- 
tary service  are  sinking.  Military  and  security  personnel  also 
offer  criminal  organizations  a  useful  set  of  skills. 

Petty  criminal  activity  and  systematic  abuses  by  the  officer 
corps  have  long  been  acknowledged  aspects  of  the  Soviet  mili- 
tary system.  As  early  as  the  late  1980s,  authorities  noticed  esca- 
lating rates  of  weapons  and  munitions  theft,  narcotics 
trafficking,  and  diversion  of  various  types  of  military  resources. 
But  the  fragmentation  of  military  authority  and  organization 
that  began  with  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  multiplied 
the  opportunities  for  such  activities.  Drug  use  afflicted  the  mil- 
itary on  a  large  scale  during  the  nine-year  occupation  of 
Afghanistan,  and  the  general  increase  in  drug  use  in  civilian 
society  brought  more  users  into  the  armed  forces  in  the  1980s 
and  1990s.  Episodes  of  random  violence  also  increased.  In 
1989  fifty-nine  officers  were  killed  in  attacks  unrelated  to  mili- 
tary action.  As  morale  dropped,  cases  of  severe  hazing  of  new 
recruits  (dedovshchina — a  tradition  that  began  under  Peter  the 
Great)  increased  until,  in  1994,  an  estimated  2,500  soldiers 
died  and  another  480  committed  suicide  as  a  direct  result  of 
hazing. 

The  illegal  sale  of  weapons  of  all  sizes  became  pervasive  in 
the  1990s.  Already  in  the  late  1980s,  Soviet  troops  in  Europe 
were  selling  large  numbers  of  individual  weapons;  as  with- 
drawal from  Europe  progressed  in  the  early  1990s,  the  sale  of 
heavy  equipment,  including  armored  vehicles  and  jet  fighters, 
also  was  reported.  The  largest  force  group  in  the  region,  the 
Western  Group  of  Forces  stationed  in  Germany,  was  the  most 
active  in  this  area,  according  to  a  series  of  investigations  in  the 
early  and  mid-1990s.  Underground  sales  were  reported  inside 
Russia  as  well,  with  large  numbers  of  weapons  moving  to  civil- 
ian criminal  organizations. 

In  late  1993,  President  Yeltsin  formed  the  State  Corporation 
for  Export  and  Import  of  Armaments  (Rosvooruzheniye)  to 
consolidate  and  control  arms  sales  under  a  single  agency,  but 
after  that  time  the  state  still  realized  only  a  small  part  of  the 
huge  hard-currency  profits  from  arms  sales,  while  a  number  of 
top  Rosvooruzheniye  officials,  with  ties  to  a  complex  web  of 
financial  enterprises  in  Russia  and  abroad,  flourished  as  sales 
continued  to  go  undocumented.  The  agency  acquired  the 
nickname  "Ros-vor,"  meaning  "Russian  thief,"  as  the  controver- 
sial activities  of  its  officers  were  publicized  and  public  confi- 


546 


The  Armed  Forces 


dence  dropped.  Shortly  after  creating  Rosvooruzheniye,  the 
government  approved  direct  arms  sales  activities  by  weapons 
manufacturers,  further  complicating  the  effort  to  monitor 
sales.  Another  state  agency,  the  State  Armament  and  Military 
Equipment  Sales  Company  (Voyentekh),  was  established  in 
1992  to  sell  used  equipment  and  arms  overseas,  with  the  pro- 
ceeds to  finance  housing  for  troops.  According  to  frequent 
allegations,  that  program  also  is  riddled  with  corruption,  most 
of  its  profits  have  not  reached  the  housing  fund,  and  much 
equipment  has  gone  to  the  criminal  world.  Among  the  benefi- 
ciaries of  such  uncontrolled  movement  have  been  the  Chechen 
guerrillas,  who  apparently  were  able  to  buy  Russian  arms  even 
after  the  beginning  of  hostilities  in  late  1994. 

Training 

According  to  Russian  and  Western  reports,  inadequate  fund- 
ing and  bad  organization  have  caused  all  of  the  armed  forces 
to  suffer  from  extremely  poor  training.  Although  numerous 
top  military  leaders  criticized  this  situation,  little  progress  has 
been  made  in  the  mid-1990s. 

Military  Schools 

In  1996  the  Ministry  of  Defense  administered  a  multilevel 
system  of  military  training  institutions,  none  of  which  had  full 
enrollment  in  the  mid-1990s.  The  system  included  eight  mili- 
tary academies  and  one  military  university,  offering  university- 
level  training  and  education  in  military  and  related  fields. 
There  were  specialized  academies  for  artillery,  chemical 
defense,  air  defense,  air  engineering,  space  engineering,  and 
medicine.  The  Military  University  in  Moscow  specialized  in 
jurisprudence  and  journalism.  In  addition,  there  were  about 
seventy  institutions  of  higher  education  (vysshiye  uchebnyye 
zavedeniya — VUZy;  sing.,  VUZ)  for  military  studies,  most  of 
which  fell  under  one  of  the  main  force  groups  and  were  fur- 
ther specialized  according  to  subject  (for  example,  the  Kazan' 
Higher  Artillery  Command-Engineer  School  and  the  Ufa 
Higher  Military  Aviation  School  for  Pilots). 

Field  Training 

Nominally,  the  Russian  armed  forces  operate  on  the  same 
six-month  training  cycle  that  was  observed  by  the  Soviet  armed 
forces.  Each  cycle  begins  with  induction  of  draftees  and  basic 
individual  training,  proceeds  to  unit  training  at  the  levels  of 


547 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

squad  through  division,  and  terminates  with  an  army-level 
exercise.  In  1994  General  Semenov  reported  that  the  ground 
forces  had  not  conducted  any  divisional  exercises  for  the  previ- 
ous two  years.  As  early  as  1989,  a  reduction  in  Russia's  military 
training  activity  became  obvious  in  CSCE  reports  of  major 
training  exercises.  This  means  that  by  1996  the  armed  forces 
had  passed  through  more  than  ten  cycles  without  conducting 
any  serious  training. 

Considering  the  Russian  military  five-year  personnel  assign- 
ment cycle,  the  training  hiatus  means  that  there  was  one,  and 
part  of  another,  military  generation  in  each  rank  with  a  serious 
training  deficiency,  or  no  training  at  all  in  their  nominal  assign- 
ments. There  were  platoon  and  company  commanders  with  no 
field  experience.  Few  battalion,  regimental,  and  division  com- 
manders had  practical  experience  in  commanding  troops  in 
the  field  at  their  present  or  preceding  level. 

The  air  forces  of  the  Russian  Federation  are  the  most  tech- 
nologically sensitive  of  the  armed  forces.  Modern  high-perfor- 
mance aircraft  demand  skilled  crews  to  operate  and  maintain 
them.  However,  in  1995  General  Deynekin  reported  receiving 
only  30  percent  of  required  funding  for  fuel,  equipment,  and 
parts  in  1995 — a  shortfall  that  cut  pilot  flight  time  in  opera- 
tional squadrons  to  thirty  to  forty  hours  per  year,  approxi- 
mately three  hours  per  month  in  the  cockpit.  By  contrast,  the 
United  States  standard  for  pilot  proficiency  is  180  to  260  hours 
per  year. 

Reform  Plans 

In  1996  Aleksey  Arbatov,  deputy  chairman  of  the  State  Duma 
Defense  Committee,  stated  that  the  armed  forces  must  be 
reduced  by  at  least  500,000  personnel,  a  force  reduction  of 
one-third,  with  a  simultaneous  increase  in  the  annual  military 
budget  of  about  US$20  billion — more  than  twice  its  level  at  the 
time. 

The  official  plan  for  armed  forces  reorganization  was  put 
forth  in  a  presidential  decree  of  August  1995.  Reforms  would 
occur  in  two  stages,  which  were  outlined  only  vaguely.  The  first 
stage,  to  last  from  1996  to  2000,  would  include  reorganization 
of  the  civilian  economy  to  provide  better  overall  budgetary  sup- 
port, stabilize  the  defense  industry,  and  revamp  the  territorial 
divisions  of  the  national  defense  system  to  match  a  new  con- 
cept of  strategic  deployment.  The  second  stage,  2001  to  2005, 


548 


The  Armed  Forces 


would  address  the  international  role  of  the  Russian  armed 
forces,  ending  with  the  creation  of  the  "army  of  the  year  2005." 

The  first  phase  was  defined  by  five  goals.  First,  a  "rational" 
level  of  strategic  nuclear  forces  would  remain  in  place  on  land, 
sea,  and  air  to  defend  against  a  global  nuclear  or  conventional 
war.  The  level  of  such  forces  would  be  influenced  by  whether 
other  powers  had  developed  ABM  defenses.  Second,  further 
downsizing  was  possible,  depending  on  the  leadership's  estima- 
tion of  optimal  size  given  world  conditions.  Third,  organiza- 
tional structure  would  be  changed  only  after  comprehensive 
research,  with  numerous  ground  forces  units  to  be  combined 
and  maintained  at  cadre  strength.  Fourth,  procurement  would 
be  centralized,  spending  priorities  strictly  observed,  and 
expenditures  carefully  monitored.  Fifth,  the  command  and 
control  system  would  be  improved  in  all  operational-strategic 
groupings,  optimizing  control  to  ensure  maximum  combat 
readiness.  There  would  be  a  clear  definition  of  the  respective 
functions  of  the  Ministry  of  Defense,  the  General  Staff,  and  the 
main  directorates.  The  newly  created  State  Commission  for 
Military  Organization  and  Development  and  the  General  Staff 
were  to  direct  the  fifth  phase. 

After  issuing  the  reform  decree,  President  Yeltsin  periodi- 
cally criticized  the  military  (most  notably  Minister  of  Defense 
Grachev)  for  what  he  described  as  a  complete  lack  of  progress 
toward  the  stated  goals.  According  to  Western  experts,  this  was 
a  justified  criticism,  given  the  disorder  and  internal  friction 
that  prevented  the  military  establishment  from  reaching  con- 
sensus on  any  policy. 

Military  service  became  particularly  unpopular  in  Russia  in 
the  mid-1990s.  Under  conditions  of  intense  political  and  social 
uncertainty,  the  traditional  appeal  to  Russian  patriotism  no 
longer  resonated  among  Russia's  youth  (see  Social  Stratifica- 
tion, ch.  5).  The  percentage  of  draft-age  youth  who  entered  the 
armed  forces  dropped  from  32  percent  in  1994  to  20  percent 
in  1995.  The  Law  on  Military  Service  stipulates  twenty-one 
grounds  for  draft  exemption,  but  in  many  cases  eligible  indi- 
viduals simply  refuse  to  report;  in  July  1996,  a  report  in  the 
daily  Pravda  referred  to  a  "daily  boycott  of  the  draft."  In  the 
first  half  of  1995,  about  3,000  conscripts  deserted,  and  in  all  of 
1995  between  50,000  and  70,000  inductees  refused  to  report. 
According  to  a  1996  Russian  report,  such  personnel  deficien- 
cies meant  that  only  about  ten  of  Russia's  sixty-nine  ground 
forces  divisions  were  prepared  for  combat.  The  armed  forces 


549 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

responded  to  manpower  shortages  by  extending  the  normal 
two-year  period  of  active-duty  service  of  those  already  in  uni- 
form; only  about  19,000  of  the  approximately  230,000  troops 
scheduled  for  discharge  in  December  1994  were  released  on 
time. 

The  two  most  compelling  reasons  for  the  failure  of  conscrip- 
tion are  the  unfavorable  living  conditions  and  pay  of  soldiers 
(less  than  US$1  per  month  at  1995  exchange  rates)  and  the 
well-publicized  and  extremely  unpopular  Chechnya  operation. 
The  Russian  tradition  of  hazing  in  the  ranks,  which  became 
more  violent  and  was  much  more  widely  reported  in  the  1990s, 
also  has  contributed  to  society's  antipathy  toward  military  ser- 
vice (see  Crime  in  the  Military,  this  ch.).  By  1996  the  approval 
rating  of  the  military  as  a  social  institution  had  slipped  to  as  lit- 
tle as  20  percent,  far  below  the  approval  ratings  achieved  in  the 
Soviet  era. 

Although  by  1996  Russia's  armed  forces  were  less  than  one- 
third  the  size  they  reached  at  their  Cold  War  peak  in  the  mid- 
1980s,  there  still  was  a  need  for  large  numbers  of  personnel 
who  were  appropriately  matched  to  their  assigned  duties  and 
who  could  be  motivated  to  serve  conscientiously.  The  issue  of 
gradually  replacing  Russia's  ineffectual  conscription  system 
with  a  volunteer  force  has  brought  heated  discussion  in  the 
defense  establishment.  The  semiannual  draft,  which  has  set 
about  200,000  as  its  regular  quota,  has  been  an  abysmal  failure 
in  the  post-Soviet  era  because  of  evasion  and  desertion.  During 
evaluation  of  an  initial,  experimental  contract  plan,  in  May 
1996  Yeltsin  unexpectedly  proposed  the  filling  of  all  personnel 
slots  in  the  armed  forces  with  contract  personnel  by  2000.  In 
1996  some  units  already  were  more  than  half  staffed  by  con- 
tract personnel,  and  an  estimated  300,000  individuals,  about  20 
percent  of  the  total  nominal  active  force,  were  serving  under 
contract.  At  that  time,  more  than  half  of  new  contractees  were 
women. 

But  the  main  obstacle  to  achieving  Yeltsin's  goal  is  funding. 
To  attract  competent  contract  volunteers,  pay  and  benefits 
must  be  higher  than  those  offered  to  conscripts.  Already  in 
early  1996,  a  reported  50,000  contract  personnel  had  broken 
their  contracts  because  of  low  pay  and  poor  housing,  and  many 
commanders  expressed  dissatisfaction  with  the  work  of  those 
who  remained.  In  mid-1996  a  final  decision  on  the  use  of  vol- 
unteers awaited  discussion  in  the  State  Duma  and  a  possible 
challenge  in  the  Constitutional  Court.

The  Armed  Forces 


Prospects  for  the  Military 

In  the  mid-1990s,  Russia's  military  establishment  included  a 
number  of  influential  holdovers  from  the  Soviet  era,  together 
with  incomplete  plans  for  reform.  That  inauspicious  combina- 
tion of  elements  was  not  reconciled  because  there  was  little 
agreement  among  military  or  civilian  policy  makers  on  the 
appropriate  speed  and  direction  of  change,  and  because  eco- 
nomic conditions  offered  no  flexibility  for  experimentation. 

To  the  extent  that  the  Chechnya  conflict  of  1994-96  was  a 
fair  test  of  combat  capability,  Russia's  armed  forces  were  far 
from  fighting  form,  even  by  their  own  evaluation.  As  they 
received  pessimistic  assessments  of  the  current  and  future  situ- 
ation, Russian  policy  makers  faced  a  complex  of  other  adjust- 
ments. In  1996  the  shapers  of  policy  on  international  relations 
and  national  security  could  not  agree  on  Russia's  status  in  the 
post-Soviet  world  (see  Foreign  Policy  Prospects,  ch.  8).  Utiliza- 
tion of  the  military's  very  limited  financial  resources  would 
require  a  consensus  on  the  areas  of  the  world  most  vital  to 
national  security.  For  example,  would  a  second  Chechnya-type 
uprising  within  the  Russian  Federation  merit  the  kind  of  effort 
expended  on  the  first  one?  What  sort  of  response  should  the 
seemingly  inevitable  expansion  of  NATO  elicit?  Should  Russia 
seek  a  permanent  military  presence  in  other  CIS  nations,  to 
bolster  national  security?  In  answering  such  questions,  military 
policy  makers  confront  a  national  psyche  still  damaged  by  the 
dissolution  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  Soviet  Union  itself. 
They  also  are  tempted  to  divert  attention  from  fundamental 
problems  by  renewing  campaigns  against  old  enemies. 

No  redirection  of  national  security  priorities  could  have 
meaning  without  a  strong  commitment  to  reorganize  the  mili- 
tary establishment  that  was  inherited  from  the  Soviet  era.  Only 
a  leaner  force  could  recapture  the  Soviet-era  reservoir  of  skill, 
pride,  and  dedication  that  was  dissipated  in  the  first  half  of  the 
1990s.  Through  1996  the  budgetary  strategy  was  to  finance 
selected  high-technology  R&D  projects  and  MIC  enterprises 
capable  of  satisfying  foreign  arms  customers  (together  with 
internal  security  "armies"  such  as  that  of  the  Ministry  of  Inter- 
nal Affairs),  while  literally  starving  conventional  troops  and 
neglecting  maintenance  budgets.  With  the  formation  of  a  new 
government  in  mid-1996,  the  voices  of  reform  became  louder, 
but  consensus  on  the  basic  requirements  had  grown  no  closer.

RUSSIA'S  INTERNAL  SECURITY  APPARATUS  underwent 
fundamental  changes  beginning  in  1992,  after  the  Soviet 
Union  dissolved  and  what  had  been  the  Russian  Soviet  Feder- 
ated Socialist  Republic  (RSFSR)  was  reconstituted  as  the  Rus- 
sian Federation.  These  changes,  initiated  by  the  government  of 
Russian  Federation  president  Boris  N.  Yeltsin,  were  part  of  a 
more  general  transition  experienced  by  Russia's  political  sys- 
tem. The  state  security  apparatus  was  restructured  in  the 
period  after  1991,  when  the  functions  of  the  Committee  for 
State  Security  (Komitet  gosudarstvennoy  bezopasnosti — KGB) 
were  distributed  among  several  agencies.  In  that  period,  the 
interactions  among  those  agencies  and  the  future  course  of 
internal  security  policy  became  key  issues  for  the  Russian  gov- 
ernment. As  the  debate  proceeded  and  the  Yeltsin  govern- 
ment's hold  on  power  became  weaker  in  the  mid-1990s,  some 
aspects  of  the  Soviet-era  internal  security  system  remained  in 
place,  and  some  earlier  reforms  were  reversed.  Because  Yeltsin 
was  perceived  to  use  the  security  system  to  bolster  presidential 
power,  serious  questions  arose  about  Russia's  acceptance  of  the 
rule  of  law. 

In  the  same  period,  Russia  suffered  an  escalating  crime  wave 
that  threatened  an  already  insecure  society  with  a  variety  of 
physical  and  economic  dangers.  In  the  massive  economic  trans- 
formation of  the  1990s,  organized-crime  organizations  per- 
vaded Russia's  economic  system  and  fostered  corruption 
among  state  officials.  White-collar  crime,  already  common  in 
the  Soviet  period,  continued  to  flourish.  The  incidence  of  ran- 
dom crimes  of  violence  and  theft  also  continued  to  increase  in 
the  mid-1990s.  Meanwhile,  Russia's  police  were  handicapped  in 
their  efforts  to  slow  the  crime  rate  by  a  lack  of  expertise,  fund- 
ing, and  support  from  the  judicial  system.  In  response  to  public 
outrage  at  this  situation,  the  Yeltsin  government  increased  the 
powers  of  internal  security  agencies,  endangering  the  protec- 
tions theoretically  enjoyed  by  private  citizens  in  post-Soviet  Rus- 
sia. 

Internal  Security  Before  1991 

The  KGB  had  been  an  integral  feature  of  the  Soviet  state 
since  it  was  established  by  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  (in  office 


555 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

1953-64)  in  1954  to  replace  the  People's  Commissariat  for 
Internal  Affairs  (Narodnyy  komissariat  vnutrennikh  del — 
NKVD),  which  during  its  twenty-year  existence  had  conducted 
the  worst  of  the  Stalinist  purges.  Between  1954  and  1991,  the 
KGB  acquired  vast  monetary  and  technical  resources,  a  corps 
of  active  personnel  numbering  more  than  500,000,  and  huge 
archival  files  containing  political  information  of  the  highest 
sensitivity.  The  KGB  often  was  characterized  as  a  state  within  a 
state.  The  organization  was  a  rigidly  hierarchical  structure 
whose  chairman  was  appointed  by  the  Politburo,  the  supreme 
executive  body  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union 
(CPSU — see  Glossary).  Key  decisions  were  made  by  the  KGB 
Collegium,  a  collective  leadership  including  the  agency's  top 
leaders  and  selected  republic  and  departmental  chiefs.  The 
various  KGB  directorates  had  responsibilities  ranging  from  sup- 
pressing political  dissent  to  guarding  borders  to  conducting 
propaganda  campaigns  abroad.  At  the  end  of  the  Soviet 
period,  the  KGB  had  five  chief  directorates,  three  smaller 
directorates,  and  numerous  administrative  and  technical  sup- 
port departments. 

In  contrast  to  the  United  States  government,  which  assigns 
the  functions  of  domestic  counterintelligence  and  foreign 
intelligence  to  separate  agencies,  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investi- 
gation  (FBI)  and  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (CIA), 
respectively,  the  Soviet  system  combined  these  functions  in  a 
single  organization.  This  practice  grew  out  of  the  ideology  of 
Soviet  governance,  which  made  little  distinction  between  exter- 
nal and  domestic  political  threats,  claiming  that  the  latter  were 
always  foreign  inspired.  According  to  that  rationale,  the  same 
investigative  techniques  were  appropriate  for  both  foreign  espi- 
onage agents  and  Soviet  citizens  who  came  under  official  suspi- 
cion. For  example,  the  KGB's  Seventh  Chief  Directorate,  whose 
task  was  to  provide  personnel  and  equipment  for  surveillance 
operations,  was  responsible  for  surveillance  of  both  foreigners 
and  Soviet  citizens. 

The  KGB's  branches  in  the  fourteen  non-Russian  republics 
duplicated  the  structure  and  operations  of  the  unionwide 
organization  centered  in  Moscow;  KGB  offices  existed  in  every 
subnational  jurisdiction  and  city  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The 
KGB's  primary  internal  function  was  surveillance  of  the  Soviet 
citizenry,  using  avast  intelligence  apparatus  to  ensure  loyalty  to 
the  regime  and  to  suppress  all  expressions  of  political  opposi- 
tion. This  apparatus  served  as  the  eyes  and  ears  of  the  party

leadership,  supplying  information  on  all  aspects  of  Soviet  soci- 
ety to  the  Politburo. 

The  First  Chief  Directorate  was  responsible  for  KGB  opera- 
tions abroad.  It  was  divided  into  three  subdirectorates,  respon- 
sible respectively  for  deep-cover  espionage  agents,  collection  of 
scientific  and  technological  intelligence,  and  infiltration  of  for- 
eign security  operations  and  surveillance  of  Soviet  citizens 
abroad.  Segmented  into  eleven  geographical  regions,  the  First 
Chief  Directorate  placed  intelligence-gathering  officers  in  legal 
positions  in  embassies  and  elsewhere  abroad.  Such  activities 
increased  markedly  after  detente  with  the  West  in  1972  permit- 
ted many  more  Soviet  officials  to  take  positions  in  Western  and 
Third  World  countries.  In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  as  many  as  50 
percent  of  such  officials  were  estimated  to  be  conducting  espio- 
nage. 

The  KGB  Security  Troops,  which  numbered  about  40,000  in 
1990,  provided  the  KGB  with  coercive  potential.  Although 
Soviet  sources  did  not  specify  the  functions  of  these  special 
troops,  Western  analysts  believed  that  one  of  their  main  tasks 
was  to  guard  the  top  leaders  in  the  Kremlin,  as  well  as  key  gov- 
ernment and  party  buildings  and  officials  at  the  major  subna- 


557

tional  levels.  Such  troops  presumably  were  commanded  by  the 
Ninth  Directorate  of  the  KGB. 

The  Security  Troops  also  included  several  units  of  signal  per- 
sonnel, who  reportedly  were  responsible  for  installation,  main- 
tenance, and  operation  of  secret  communications  facilities  for 
leading  party  and  government  bodies,  including  the  Ministry 
of  Defense.  Other  special  KGB  troops  performed  counterter- 
rorist  and  counterintelligence  operations.  Such  troops  were 
employed,  together  with  the  Internal  Troops  of  the  Ministry  of 
Internal  Affairs  (Ministerstvo  vnutrennikh  del — MVD),  to  sup- 
press public  protests  and  disperse  demonstrations.  Special  KGB 
troops  also  were  trained  for  sabotage  and  diversionary  missions 
abroad. 

The  Internal  Troops  were  a  component  of  the  armed  forces 
but  were  subordinate  to  the  MVD.  Numbering  about  260,000 
in  1990,  the  Internal  Troops  were  mostly  conscripts  with  a  two- 
year  service  obligation.  Candidates  were  accepted  from  both 
the  active  military  and  civilian  society.  Four  schools  trained  the 
Internal  Troops'  officer  corps. 

The  Internal  Troops  supported  MVD  missions  by  aiding  the 
regular  police  in  crowd  control  in  large  cities  and  by  guarding 
strategically  significant  sites  such  as  large  industrial  enterprises, 
railroad  stations,  and  large  stockpiles  of  food  and  materiel.  A 
critical  mission  was  the  prevention  of  internal  disorder  that 
might  endanger  a  regime's  political  stability.  Likely  working  in 
concert  with  KGB  Security  Troops,  the  Internal  Troops  played 
a  direct  role  in  suppressing  anti-Soviet  demonstrations  in  the 
non-Russian  republics  and  strikes  by  Russian  and  other  work- 
ers. Most  units  of  the  Internal  Troops  were  composed  solely  of 
infantry  with  no  heavy  armaments;  only  one  operational  divi- 
sion was  present  in  Moscow  in  1990.  In  this  configuration,  the 
Internal  Troops  also  might  have  been  assigned  rear-echelon 
security  missions  in  case  of  war;  they  performed  this  duty  in 
World  War  II. 

Regular  police  forces,  called  the  militia,  which  were  the 
direct  responsibility  of  the  MVD,  also  played  an  important  role 
in  preserving  internal  order  and  fighting  corruption;  regional 
and  local  jurisdictions  had  no  police  powers.  The  Procuracy 
was  the  chief  investigatory  and  prosecutorial  agency  for  nonpo- 
litical  crimes,  with  a  hierarchical  organization  that  provided 
procurators  (state  prosecutors)  at  all  levels  of  government. 
Although  the  new  Russian  government  made  several  changes 
in  the  laws  and  organization  of  criminal  justice  after  1991,  the 


558

overall  system  of  internal  security  retained  many  of  the  charac- 
teristics of  its  Soviet  predecessor. 

Successor  Agencies  to  the  KGB 

By  early  1991,  the  powerful  KGB  organization  was  being  dis- 
mantled. The  development  of  the  post-Soviet  internal  security 
apparatus  took  place  in  a  highly  volatile  political  environment, 
with  President  Yeltsin  threatened  by  political  opposition,  eco- 
nomic crises,  outbreaks  of  ethnic  conflict,  and  sharply  escalat- 
ing crime.  Under  these  circumstances,  Yeltsin  and  his  advisers 
had  to  rely  on  state  security  and  internal  police  agencies  for 
support  in  devising  and  implementing  internal  security  strate- 
gies. 

The  KGB  was  dissolved  officially  in  December  1991,  a  few 
weeks  before  the  Soviet  Union  itself.  Foreign  observers  saw  the 
end  of  the  KGB  as  a  sign  that  democracy  would  prevail  in  the 
newly  created  Russian  Federation.  But  President  Yeltsin  did  not 
completely  eliminate  the  security  apparatus.  Instead,  he  dis- 
persed the  functions  of  the  former  KGB  among  several  differ- 
ent agencies,  most  of  which  performed  tasks  similar  to  those  of 
the  various  KGB  directorates. 

In  1992  Yeltsin  never  made  a  clear  statement  of  his  plans  for 
the  security  services,  except  for  occasional  claims  that  the  new 
services  would  be  very  different  from  the  KGB.  Nevertheless, 
early  in  1992  certain  trends  already  could  be  discerned.  Gener- 
ally speaking,  Yeltsin  had  three  main  aims  for  the  internal  secu- 
rity services.  Above  all,  he  wanted  to  use  the  services  to  support 
him  in  his  battles  with  high-level  political  opponents.  Second, 
he  wanted  the  security  apparatus  to  counter  broader  domestic 
threats — ethnic  separatism,  terrorism,  labor  unrest,  drug  traf- 
ficking, and  organized  crime.  Third,  he  intended  that  the  secu- 
rity apparatus  carry  out  counterintelligence  against  foreign 
spies  operating  in  Russia. 

After  the  creation  of  fifteen  new  states  from  the  republics  of 
the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  territorial  branches  of  the  former 
KGB  were  transferred  to  the  control  of  the  new  governments  of 
these  states,  each  of  which  made  reforms  deemed  appropriate 
to  the  political  and  national  security  needs  of  the  regime  in 
power.  The  Russian  Federation,  however,  which  as  the  RSFSR 
had  housed  KGB  central  operations  in  Moscow,  inherited  the 
bulk  of  the  KGB's  resources  and  personnel.  As  early  as  January 
1992,  five  separate  security  agencies  had  emerged  in  Russia  to 
take  the  place  of  the  KGB.  Four  of  them  were  concerned  with 


559 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

internal  security;  the  fifth  was  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Service, 
which  replaced  the  KGB's  First  Chief  Directorate. 

Ministry  of  Security  (MB) 

Within  Russia  the  largest  KGB  successor  agency  was  the  Min- 
istry of  Security  ( Ministers tvo  bezopasnosti — MB),  which  num- 
bered some  137,000  employees  and  was  designated  a 
counterintelligence  agency.  The  Ministry  of  Security  inherited 
the  tasks  of  several  KGB  directorates  and  chief  directorates:  the 
Second  Chief  Directorate  (counterintelligence  against  foreign- 
ers), the  Third  Chief  Directorate  (military  counterintelli- 
gence), the  Fourth  Directorate  (transportation  security),  the 
Fifth  Chief  Directorate  (domestic  political  security),  the  Sixth 
Directorate  (activities  against  economic  crime  and  official  cor- 
ruption), and  the  Seventh  Directorate  (surveillance  activities). 

In  July  1992,  Yeltsin  signed — and  Russia's  Supreme  Soviet 
(parliament)  ratified — a  law  concerning  the  governance  of  the 
Ministry  of  Security.  The  law  gave  Yeltsin  sweeping  authority 
over  security  operations  and  aroused  concern  among  Russian 
democrats.  They  worried  because  the  new  law  so  closely  resem- 
bled the  one  on  the  KGB  that  had  been  enacted  by  the  Soviet 
government  just  fourteen  months  earlier.  The  law  conferred 
essentially  the  same  mission  and  powers  on  the  Ministry  of 
Security  that  the  earlier  law  had  granted  to  the  KGB,  in  some 
cases  almost  verbatim.  The  main  difference  was  that  in  the  past 
the  KGB  had  been  controlled  by  the  leadership  of  the  CPSU, 
whereas  the  1992  law  gave  Yeltsin,  as  president,  control  of  the 
Ministry  of  Security.  The  Russian  parliament  was  granted  some 
theoretical  oversight  functions,  but  they  never  were  exercised 
in  practice. 

Yeltsin's  first  minister  of  security,  former  MVD  chief  Viktor 
Barannikov,  left  most  of  the  organization's  former  KGB  offi- 
cials in  place.  In  the  spring  of  1993,  when  an  uneasy  truce 
between  Yeltsin  and  the  Russian  parliament  was  broken  and 
the  Supreme  Soviet  voted  to  deprive  Yeltsin  of  his  extraordi- 
nary presidential  powers,  Yeltsin  called  upon  Barannikov  and 
the  Ministry  of  Security  for  support  as  the  president  declared 
the  imposition  of  "special  ruje"  giving  him  veto  power  over  par- 
liamentary legislation  until  new  elections  were  held.  However, 
Barannikov  declined  to  involve  his  ministry  in  the  political  con- 
frontation between  the  executive  and  legislative  branches,  urg- 
ing that  a  compromise  be  found.  When  the  Ministry  of  Defense

also  failed  to  support  his  position,  Yeltsin  backed  down  from 
his  confrontational  stance. 

The  split  between  Yeltsin  and  Barannikov  was  exacerbated 
by  Barannikov's  response  to  the  government  corruption  issue 
in  1992-93.  Bribe  taking  and  behind-the-scenes  deals,  which 
had  been  accepted  practices  for  Soviet  officials,  were  traditions 
that  died  hard,  especially  in  the  absence  of  laws  and  regula- 
tions prohibiting  officials  from  abusing  their  positions.  When 
privatization  of  state  property  began,  the  scale  of  corruption 
increased  dramatically.  The  overlap  between  government-con- 
trolled economic  enterprises  and  private  entrepreneurial  ven- 
tures created  vast  opportunities  for  illegal  economic  activity  at 
the  highest  levels. 

Beginning  in  1992,  the  Ministry  of  Security  became  involved 
in  the  war  against  organized  crime  and  official  corruption. 
Before  long,  however,  the  campaign  turned  into  an  exchange 
of  accusations  of  corruption  among  Russia's  political  leaders, 
with  the  Ministry  of  Security  in  the  middle.  Yeltsin  wanted  to 
use  the  corruption  campaign  as  a  political  weapon  in  fighting 
his  opponents,  but  his  own  entourage  was  soon  hit  with 


561

charges  of  covering  up  crimes — a  tactic  of  Yeltsin's  enemies  to 
which  Barannikov  lent  at  least  passive  support.  Barannikov's 
failures  to  support  Yeltsin  led  to  the  security  minister's  dis- 
missal in  mid-1993. 

Barannikov's  replacement,  Nikolay  Golushko,  did  not  last 
long  in  his  job.  After  Yeltsin's  threat  to  dissolve  the  Russian  par- 
liament in  September  1993,  which  ended  in  bloodshed  on  the 
streets  of  Moscow,  the  president  realized  that  Golushko  was 
also  unwilling  to  use  the  forces  of  the  Ministry  of  Security  to 
back  up  the  president.  In  this  case,  Yeltsin  not  only  dismissed 
his  minister  of  security  but  also  disbanded  the  ministry  and 
replaced  it  with  a  new  agency,  the  Federal  Counterintelligence 
Service  (Federal'naya  sluzhba  kontrarazvedki — FSK). 

Federal  Counterintelligence  Service  (FSK) 

The  law  creating  the  FSK,  signed  in  January  1994,  gave  the 
president  sole  control  of  the  agency,  eliminating  the  theoreti- 
cal monitoring  role  granted  to  the  parliament  and  the  judi- 
ciary in  the  1992  law  on  the  Ministry  of  Security.  The  original 
outline  of  the  FSK's  powers  eliminated  the  criminal  investiga- 
tive powers  of  the  Ministry  of  Security,  retaining  only  powers  of 
inquiry.  But  the  final  statute  was  ambiguous  on  this  issue, 
assigning  to  the  FSK  the  task  of  "carrying  out  technical-opera- 
tional measures,  [and]  criminological  and  other  expert  assess- 
ments and  investigations."  The  statute  also  stipulated  that  the 
FSK  was  to  "develop  and  implement  measures  to  combat  smug- 
gling and  corruption."  Such  language  apparently  assigned  a 
key  role  to  the  successor  of  the  Ministry  of  Security  in  the 
intensifying  struggle  against  economic  crime  and  official  cor- 
ruption. 

According  to  its  enabling  statute,  the  FSK  had  eighteen 
directorates,  or  departments,  plus  a  secretariat  and  a  public 
relations  center.  Because  some  of  the  Ministry  of  Security's 
functions  were  dispersed  to  other  security  agencies,  the  initial 
FSK  staff  numbered  about  75,000,  a  substantial  reduction  from 
the  135,000  people  who  had  been  working  for  the  Ministry  of 
Security  in  1992.  The  reduction  process  began  to  reverse  itself 
within  a  few  months,  however,  as  the  FSK  regained  the  criminal 
investigation  functions  of  the  Ministry  of  Security.  By  July  1994, 
the  FSK  reported  a  staff  of  100,000. 

Golushko's  replacement  as  minister  of  security  was  his 
former  first  deputy,  Sergey  Stepashin,  who  had  served  as  head 
of  the  Parliamentary  Commission  on  Defense  and  Security  dur- 


562 


Internal  Security 


ing  1992-93.  Stepashin's  arrival  coincided  with  the  establish- 
ment of  a  new  economic  counterintelligence  directorate  in  the 
FSK  and  development  of  new  laws  to  improve  the  FSK's  ability 
to  fight  corruption.  Stepashin  announced  measures  against 
underground  markets  and  "shadow  capital,"  phenomena  of  the 
transition  period  that  had  been  defended  as  stimuli  for  the 
national  economy.  He  also  defended  the  FSK  against  critics 
who  accused  the  agency  of  persecuting  private  entrepreneurs. 

In  addition  to  fighting  crime  and  corruption,  the  FSK  played 
a  prominent  role  in  dealing  with  ethnic  problems.  One  worry 
for  the  agency  was  the  possibility  of  terrorist  acts  by  dissident 
non-Russian  nationalities  within  the  Russian  Federation. 
Approximately  20  percent  of  Russia's  population  is  non-Rus- 
sian, including  more  than  100  nationalities  concentrated  in 
Russia's  thirty-two  ethnically  designated  territorial  units.  Ten- 
sion over  unresolved  ethnic  and  economic  issues  had  been 
mounting  steadily  since  1990,  as  non-Russian  minorities 
became  increasingly  belligerent  in  their  demands  for  auton- 
omy from  Moscow  (see  Ethnic  Composition,  ch.  4).  The  FSK 
was  responsible  for  cooperating  with  other  agencies  of  the 
Yeltsin  government  in  monitoring  ethnic  issues,  suppressing 
separatist  unrest,  and  preventing  violent  conflict  or  terrorism. 
In  keeping  with  this  mandate,  FSK  troops  joined  MVD  forces  in 
backing  Russian  regular  armed  forces  in  the  occupation  of 
Chechnya  (see  Security  Operations  in  Chechnya,  this  ch.).  Rus- 
sian security  elements  also  have  been  active  in  Georgia,  where 
they  have  assisted  regular  forces  in  containing  the  indepen- 
dence drive  of  Abkhazian  troops  and  policing  a  two-year  cease- 
fire that  showed  no  sign  of  evolving  into  a  permanent  settle- 
ment as  of  mid-1996. 

Federal  Security  Service  (FSB) 

The  FSK  was  replaced  by  the  Federal  Security  Service  (Fede- 
ral'naya  sluzhba  bezopasnosti — FSB)  in  April  1995.  The  new 
Law  on  Organs  of  the  Federal  Security  Service  outlined  the 
FSB's  mission  in  detail.  The  FSB  regained  a  number  of  the 
functions  that  had  been  eliminated  in  earlier  post-KGB  reorga- 
nizations. Investigative  authority  was  fully  restored  by  the  law, 
although  the  FSK  had  already  been  conducting  criminal  inves- 
tigations on  the  basis  of  a  presidential  decree  issued  months 
before.  Russia's  fourteen  investigative  detention  prisons  and 
several  special  troop  detachments  also  returned  to  the  control 
of  the  security  service. 


563 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

The  1995  law  authorizes  security  police  to  enter  private  resi- 
dences if  "there  is  sufficient  reason  to  suppose  that  a  crime  is 
being  or  has  been  perpetrated  there  ...  or  if  pursuing  persons 
suspected  of  committing  a  crime."  In  such  cases,  related  laws 
require  the  officer  in  charge  only  to  inform  the  procurator 
within  twenty-four  hours  after  entering  a  residence.  Like  the 
FSK  statute,  the  new  law  gave  the  president  direction  of  the 
activities  of  the  security  service,  which  has  the  status  of  a  fed- 
eral executive  organ.  Article  23  of  the  law  stipulated  that  the 
president,  the  Federal  Assembly  (parliament),  and  the  judicial 
organs  monitor  the  security  service.  But  the  only  right  given 
deputies  of  the  State  Duma  (the  assembly's  more  powerful 
lower  house)  in  this  regard  was  a  vague  stipulation  that  depu- 
ties could  obtain  information  regarding  the  activity  of  FSB 
organs  in  accordance  with  procedures  laid  down  by  legislation. 
The  imprecision  of  actual  oversight  functions  was  com- 
pounded by  the  security  law's  provision  that  unpublished  "nor- 
mative acts"  would  govern  much  of  the  FSB's  operations. 

The  law  gave  the  FSB  the  right  to  conduct  intelligence  oper- 
ations both  within  the  country  and  abroad  for  the  purpose  of 
"enhancing  the  economic,  scientific-technical  and  defense 
potential"  of  Russia.  Although  FSB  intelligence  operations 
abroad  are  to  be  carried  out  in  collaboration  with  the  Foreign 
Intelligence  Service,  the  specifics  of  the  collaboration  were  not 
spelled  out.  The  liberal  press  reacted  with  great  skepticism  to 
the  new  law's  potential  for  human  rights  violations  and  for  rein- 
carnation of  the  KGB. 

Although  the  FSB  is  more  powerful  than  its  predecessor,  FSB 
chief  Stepashin  operated  under  a  political  cloud  because  of  his 
support  for  the  botched  Chechnya  invasion.  In  July  1995,  pres- 
sured by  the  State  Duma  and  members  of  his  administration, 
Yeltsin  replaced  Stepashin  with  the  head  of  the  Main  Guard 
Directorate,  General  Mikhail  Barsukov  (see  Main  Guard  Direc- 
torate (GUO),  this  ch.).  Barsukov  was  closely  linked  to  the 
director  of  Yeltsin's  personal  bodyguard  organization  (the  Pres- 
idential Security  Service),  Aleksandr  Korzhakov,  who  had 
acquired  powerful  political  influence  in  the  Kremlin. 

Federal  Agency  for  Government  Communications  and  Infor- 
mation (FAPSI) 

The  KGB's  Eighth  Chief  Directorate,  which  oversaw  govern- 
ment communications  and  cipher  systems,  and  another  techni- 
cal directorate,  the  sixteenth,  were  combined  as  the  Federal 


564 


Internal  Security 


Agency  for  Government  Communications  and  Information 
(Federal'noye  agentstvo  pravitel'stvennykh  svyazi  i  infor- 
matsii — FAPSI),  of  which  the  former  head  of  the  Eighth  Chief 
Directorate,  Aleksandr  Starovoytov,  was  named  director.  FAPSI 
has  unlimited  technical  capabilities  for  monitoring  communi- 
cations and  gathering  intelligence.  When  the  Law  on  Federal 
Organs  of  Government  Communications  and  Information  was 
published  in  February  1993,  Russia's  liberal  press  protested 
loudly.  The  newspaper  Nezavisimaya  gazeta  called  it  the  "law  of 
Big  Brother,"  pointing  out  that  it  not  only  gives  the  executive 
organs  of  government  a  monopoly  over  government  communi- 
cations and  information  but  permits  unwarranted  interference 
in  the  communications  networks  of  private  banks  and  firms. 

The  communications  and  information  law  authorized  FAPSI 
to  issue  licenses  for  the  export  and  import  of  information  tech- 
nology, as  well  as  for  the  telecommunications  of  all  private 
financial  institutions.  Equipped  with  a  body  of  special  commu- 
nications troops  (authorized  by  the  1996  budget  to  number 
54,000),  FAPSI  was  given  the  right  to  monitor  encoded  com- 
munications of  both  government  agencies  and  nonstate  enter- 
prises. This  means  that  the  agency  can  penetrate  all  private 
information  systems.  The  law  stipulated  little  parliamentary 
supervision  of  FAPSI  aside  from  a  vague  statement  that  agency 
officials  were  to  give  reports  to  the  legislative  branch.  The  pres- 
ident, by  contrast,  was  given  specific  power  to  monitor  the  exe- 
cution of  basic  tasks  assigned  to  FAPSI  and  to  "sanction  their 
operations." 

Some  of  the  functions  of  FAPSI  overlap  those  of  the  FSB. 
The  FSB's  enabling  law  mandated  that  it  detect  signals  from 
radio-electronic  transmitters,  carry  out  cipher  work  within  its 
own  agency,  and  protect  coded  information  in  other  state  orga- 
nizations and  even  private  enterprises.  No  specific  boundary 
between  the  ciphering  and  communications  functions  of  the 
two  agencies  was  delineated  in  their  enabling  legislation,  and 
there  was  even  speculation  that  FAPSI  would  be  merged  into 
the  FSB.  A  presidential  decree  of  April  1995  defined  agency 
responsibilities  in  the  area  of  telecommunications  licensing. 

A  critical  area  of  overlap — and  competition — is  protection 
of  data  of  crucial  economic  and  strategic  significance.  By  mid- 
1995  FAPSI  director  Starovoytov  was  pushing  for  a  larger  role 
for  FAPSI  in  this  area.  He  began  issuing  warnings  about  the 
intensified  threat  to  secret  economic  data  (including  that  of 
the  Russian  Central  Bank)  from  Western  special  services,  which 


565 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

he  said  required  his  agency  to  take  more  stringent  security 
measures. 

Main  Guard  Directorate  (GUO) 

In  mid-1992  the  KGB's  Ninth  Directorate,  charged  with 
guarding  government  leaders  and  key  buildings  and  installa- 
tions, became  the  Main  Guard  Directorate  (Glavnoye  uprav- 
leniye  okhraneniya — GUO),  which  until  July  1995  was  headed 
by  Mikhail  Barsukov.  When  Barsukov  moved  to  the  FSB,  he  was 
replaced  as  chief  of  the  GUO  by  his  deputy,  General  Yuriy 
Krapivin.  Until  mid-1996  the  GUO  included  an  autonomous 
subdivision,  the  Presidential  Security  Service,  headed  by  Alek- 
sandr  Korzhakov.  Beginning  in  1991,  both  the  GUO  and 
Korzhakov's  service  grew  steadily.  By  late  1994,  the  GUO  staff 
reportedly  had  increased  from  8,000  to  more  than  20,000  per- 
sons assigned  to  guard  the  offices,  automobiles,  apartments, 
and  dachas  of  Russia's  highest  leaders,  together  with  a  variety 
of  secret  "objects  of  state  importance." 

The  tasks  and  missions  of  the  GUO  are  described  in  the  Law 
on  State  Protection  of  Government  Bodies  and  Their  Officials, 
passed  in  April  1993.  As  of  mid-1996,  the  agency  had  the  same 
status  as  a  state  committee,  but  in  fact  the  general  statutes 
describing  the  government  and  the  office  of  the  presidency 
made  no  provision  for  such  a  structure  (see  The  Constitution 
and  Government  Structure,  ch.  7).  The  GUO's  legal  authoriza- 
tion to  engage  in  investigative  operations  gives  its  officers  the 
power  to  undertake  invasive  activities  such  as  shadowing  citi- 
zens and  tapping  telephones.  The  GUO  was  reported  to  have 
an  unlimited  budget,  which  it  used  to  acquire  sophisticated 
Western  listening  devices  for  use  in  Kremlin  offices. 

Shortly  after  the  creation  of  the  GUO,  Yeltsin  included  in  it 
the  elite  Alpha  Group,  a  crack  antiterrorist  unit  of  500  person- 
nel (200  in  Moscow,  300  elsewhere  in  Russia)  that  had  been 
involved  in  operations  in  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  and  Lithua- 
nia. The  Alpha  Group  had  played  a  decisive  role  in  the  coup  of 
August  1991  by  refusing  the  coup  leaders'  orders  to  storm  the 
parliament  building,  in  spite  of  the  group's  subordination  to 
the  KGB,  whose  chief,  Vladimir  Kryuchkov,  was  a  coup  leader. 
In  the  following  years,  the  Alpha  Group  gained  a  national  rep- 
utation and  became  connected  with  figures  in  legitimate  busi- 
ness, organized  crime,  and  politics.  In  early  1996,  Alpha  Group 
veterans  headed  an  estimated  thirty-five  commercial  enter- 
prises in  Moscow. 


566 


Internal  Security 


In  June  1995,  the  Alpha  Group  was  sent  to  break  the  Buden- 
novsk  hostage  crisis  when  Chechen  rebels  seized  a  hospital  in 
southern  Russia.  Yeltsin  disavowed  responsibility  for  the 
attack's  subsequent  failure,  and  two  months  later  he  trans- 
ferred the  Alpha  Group  back  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FSB.  In 
1995,  under  the  leadership  of  Sergey  Goncharov,  the  Alpha  vet- 
erans' association  became  politically  active,  strongly  opposing 
Yeltsin  loyalists  in  the  December  parliamentary  elections  (see 
The  Elections  of  1995,  ch.  7).  This  antigovernment  activity  by 
former  members  of  Yeltsin's  security  force  raised  questions 
about  the  loyalty  of  active  security  agencies.  Following  the  1995 
elections,  Goncharov's  group  continued  to  advocate  restora- 
tion of  Russia's  military  influence  among  the  former  Soviet 
republics  that  make  up  its  "near  abroad,"  as  well  as  harsh  mea- 
sures against  domestic  organized  crime. 

By  December  1993,  Korzhakov's  Presidential  Security  Ser- 
vice had  become  independent  of  the  GUO,  placing  Korzhakov 
in  a  position  subordinate  only  to  Yeltsin.  From  the  time  of  his 
appointment,  Korzhakov  was  at  Yeltsin's  side  constantly,  becom- 
ing the  most  indispensable  member  of  the  presidential  security 
force.  Besides  overseeing  about  4,000  guards,  Korzhakov  came 
to  supervise  all  the  services  in  support  of  the  president's  opera- 
tions. These  included  communications,  presidential  aircraft, 
and  the  secret  bunker  to  be  occupied  in  case  war  broke  out. 
This  prominent  role  led  to  speculation  about  Korzhakov's 
influence  on  policy  matters  outside  the  area  of  security,  and  his 
infrequent  policy  statements  were  closely  analyzed  by  the  news 
media.  In  June  1996,  Yeltsin  dismissed  Korzhakov,  together 
with  FSB  chief  Barsukov  and  First  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Oleg 
Soskovets,  eliminating  some  of  the  most  influential  govern- 
ment figures  of  the  anti-Western  political  faction  prior  to  the 
second  round  of  the  presidential  election. 

Federal  Border  Service  and  Border  Security 

The  fourth  agency  to  emerge  from  the  dismantled  KGB  was 
the  national  border  troops  command,  which  formerly  had 
been  administered  as  the  KGB's  Border  Troops  Directorate.  By 
the  mid-1990s,  both  the  subordination  and  the  size  of  this 
organization  had  undergone  considerable  change.  For  the 
Russian  Federation,  national  border  security  issues  have  been 
much  different  from  those  of  the  Soviet  Union;  for  this  reason, 
and  because  of  depleted  resources  to  support  security  opera- 
tions, border  policy  has  become  an  especially  important  part  of 


567 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Russia's  overall  relations  with  other  members  of  the  Common- 
wealth of  Independent  States  (CIS — see  Glossary). 

Border  Security  Agencies 

In  1989  the  Border  Troops'  personnel  strength  was  esti- 
mated at  230,000.  Although  under  the  operational  authority  of 
the  KGB,  border  troops  were  conscripted  as  part  of  the  bian- 
nual callup  of  the  Ministry  of  Defense,  and  troop  induction 
and  discharge  were  regulated  by  the  1967  Law  on  Universal 
Military  Service  applicable  to  all  the  armed  forces  of  the  Soviet 
Union. 

In  the  1980s,  the  duties  of  the  Border  Troops  included 
repulsing  armed  incursions  into  Soviet  territory;  preventing 
illegal  crossings  of  the  border  or  the  transport  of  subversive  or 
dangerous  materials;  monitoring  the  observance  of  established 
procedures  at  border  crossings  and  of  navigation  procedures  in 
Soviet  territorial  waters;  and  assisting  state  agencies  in  the  pres- 
ervation of  natural  resources  and  in  environmental  protection. 
In  carrying  out  these  duties,  border  troops  were  authorized  to 
examine  documents  and  possessions  of  persons  crossing  the 
borders  and  to  confiscate  articles;  to  conduct  inquiries  in  cases 
of  violation  of  the  state  border;  and  to  arrest,  search,  and  inter- 
rogate individuals  suspected  of  border  violations. 

In  the  Soviet  system,  the  border  soldier  was  expected  to 
defend  both  the  physical  border  and  the  state  ideology.  The 
second  of  those  assignments  involved  detecting  and  confiscat- 
ing subversive  literature  and  preventing,  by  violent  means  if 
necessary,  the  escape  of  citizens  across  the  border. 

In  1992  the  Committee  for  the  Protection  of  State  Borders, 
an  agency  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Security,  succeeded 
the  KGB's  Border  Troops  Directorate  in  administering  frontier 
control.  Although  the  personnel  level  had  been  reduced  to 
about  180,000,  the  basic  structure  of  the  agency  and  the  border 
configuration  remained  substantially  the  same  as  they  had 
been  in  the  late  Soviet  period.  Viktor  Shlyakhtin,  the  first  post- 
Soviet  chief  of  the  border  troops,  was  dismissed  in  July  1993 
after  more  than  twenty  Russian  border  guards  were  killed  in  an 
attack  on  their  post  along  the  Afghanistan-Tajikistan  border. 
Yeltsin  replaced  Shlyakhtin  with  General  Andrey  Nikolayev, 
who  had  been  first  deputy  chief  of  the  General  Staff  of  the 
armed  forces.  This  appointment  was  a  sharp  departure  from 
the  usual  practice  of  naming  a  career  border  troops  officer  to 
the  top  post. 


568 


Internal  Security 


In  late  1993,  Yeltsin  established  the  Federal  Border  Service 
to  administer  frontier  control  and  gave  that  agency  the  status 
of  a  federal  ministry  under  direct  presidential  control.  The 
FSK  (and  then  its  successor,  the  FSB)  retained  operational 
responsibility  for  counterintelligence  along  the  borders,  how- 
ever. In  1995  Nikolayev  announced  an  ambitious  program  for 
building  up  and  improving  the  border  service  in  the  years 
1996-2000.  The  1996  federal  budget  authorized  a  total  troop 
strength  of  210,000,  which  would  be  a  significant  increase  from 
the  135,000  troops  on  duty  in  1994.  In  1996  the  Federal  Border 
Service  oversaw  six  border  districts  and  three  special  groups  of 
border  troops  in  the  Arctic,  Kaliningrad,  and  Moscow,  as  well  as 
an  independent  border  control  detachment  operating  at  Rus- 
sia's major  airports. 

Given  the  agency's  ambitious  personnel  requirements,  staff- 
ing and  financing  the  new  border  posts  became  problematic  in 
the  mid-1990s.  Although  Nikolayev  warned  parliament  that  his 
resources  were  insufficient,  the  Federal  Border  Service's  1995 
budget  was  only  70  percent  of  the  amount  requested.  Equip- 
ment was  hopelessly  outdated  and  in  need  of  repair.  According 
to  estimates,  in  1995  some  40  percent  of  the  signaling  and  com- 
munications systems  along  the  border  had  surpassed  their  ser- 
vice lives. 

Post-Soviet  Border  Policy 

In  the  1990s,  Russia  lacked  the  secure  buffer  zone  of  Soviet 
republics  and  subservient  East  European  countries  that  had 
provided  border  security  in  the  Soviet  era.  The  status  of  Rus- 
sia's borders  with  neighbors  Azerbaijan,  Estonia,  Georgia, 
Latvia,  and  Ukraine  has  required  the  presence  of  a  substantial 
force  of  armed  troops.  In  Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  and  Tajikistan, 
ethnic  conflict  has  caused  chronic  instability  near  Russia's  bor- 
ders in  the  first  half-decade  of  independence.  In  early  1996, 
the  FSB  reported  that  13,500  kilometers  of  the  national  bor- 
ders were  not  defined  by  internationally  recognized  treaties. 
After  negotiations  with  Estonia  failed  in  1996,  Russia  unilater- 
ally defined  its  border  with  that  state,  requiring  the  presence  of 
border  forces  until  disputes  can  be  resolved.  The  border 
between  Latvia  and  Russia  also  remained  in  dispute  as  of  mid- 
1996. 

After  the  Soviet  Union  was  dissolved,  it  soon  became  clear 
that  Russia  did  not  have  the  resources  to  establish  a  fully 
equipped  border  regime  along  its  boundaries  within  the  CIS.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

In  1993  Russia  stated  openly  that  its  top  priority  was  to  guard 
the  outside  borders  of  the  CIS  (hence  most  of  what  had  been 
the  international  borders  of  the  Soviet  Union)  rather  than  the 
borders  that  Russia  now  shared  with  CIS  countries  (see  The 
Near  Abroad,  ch.  8).  Such  a  policy  reestablished  the  border 
republics  as  a  buffer  zone  against  potential  invasion  from 
China  or  the  Islamic  states  of  Central  Asia.  The  other  CIS  states 
do  not  have  the  resources  to  secure  their  outer  boundaries,  a 
situation  that  led  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s  to  the  mutually 
acceptable  deployment  of  Russian  border  forces  in  each  of  the 
five  Central  Asian  republics.  In  Kyrgyzstan  a  few  thousand 
troops  were  stationed  along  the  Chinese  border.  Certain  outer 
boundaries  of  the  CIS,  such  as  the  Tajikistani  border  with 
Afghanistan,  required  extra  troop  strength  because  of  constant 
armed  conflict.  In  1994  Russia  doubled  its  Tajikistan  border 
force  to  about  15,000  troops. 

One  goal  of  this  policy  was  to  preserve  the  capability  for 
quick  action  in  case  of  border  conflict  and  to  protect  Russia's 
"internal"  frontiers  from  the  smuggling  of  people  and  contra- 
band, including  arms.  The  second  goal,  most  visible  in  Georgia 
and  Tajikistan,  was  "peacekeeping"  in  pursuit  of  Moscow's  for- 
eign policy  priorities  within  the  border  country.  In  pursuit  of 
the  second  goal,  in  the  mid-1990s  border  forces  increasingly 
were  used  as  an  extension  of  Russia's  military  power  in  the  CIS. 

The  revised  view  of  border  security  naturally  brought  with  it 
an  effort  at  reintegration  of  the  former  Soviet  republics.  Russia 
began  to  advocate  "transparent  borders"  with  the  coterminous 
CIS  states — Azerbaijan,  Belarus,  Georgia,  Kazakstan,  and 
Ukraine.  This  meant  that  borders  would  remain  open  for  the 
unrestricted  passage  of  people  and  goods.  Strict  border 
regimes  would  be  established  only  in  zones  of  acute  conflict, 
such  as  the  North  Caucasus.  The  April  1993  Law  on  the  State 
Border  of  the  Russian  Federation  reflected  this  policy  by  abol- 
ishing the  specially  designated  border  districts  of  the  Soviet  sys- 
tem, leaving  only  border  strips  five  kilometers  wide.  The  law 
stipulated  the  goal  of  establishing  a  reduced  and  simplified 
border  regime  with  all  CIS  states. 

Security  Operations  in  Chechnya 

The  internal  instability  of  the  Soviet  government  during 
1990-91  invited  expressions  of  separatism  in  many  of  Russia's 
distinct  ethnic  enclaves,  as  well  as  in  ethnically  Russian  districts 
in  the  Soviet  Far  East.  The  most  volatile  and  troublesome  area 


570 


Internal  Security 


within  the  new  Russian  Federation  was  the  North  Caucasus, 
where  the  predominantly  Muslim  former  Chechen-Ingush 
Autonomous  Republic  is  located.  A  crisis  had  been  building 
there  for  some  time  (see  Movements  Toward  Sovereignty,  ch. 
4).  In  October  1991,  a  Chechen  nationalist  movement  headed 
by  former  Soviet  air  force  general  Dzhokar  Dudayev  overthrew 
the  existing  government  and  installed  Dudayev  as  president. 
Shortly  thereafter,  the  Chechen  Supreme  Soviet  declared 
Chechnya  a  sovereign  republic. 

Yeltsin  responded  by  deploying  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs 
(MVD)  troops  in  the  region,  but  the  Russian  Supreme  Soviet 
declared  the  action  invalid  and  ordered  him  to  settle  the  con- 
flict peaceably.  The  perceived  indecision  by  the  Russian  gov- 
ernment encouraged  Chechen  nationalists  to  pursue  complete 
political  independence  and  Russian  recognition  of  that  status. 
The  Yeltsin  administration  was  equally  adamant  in  its  refusal  to 
negotiate  until  Chechnya  redesignated  itself  part  of  the  Rus- 
sian Federation.  Violence  erupted  in  Chechnya  on  numerous 
occasions  during  1993-94,  and  Russian  security  forces  became 
fully  involved  in  the  conflict.  In  July  1994,  a  group  of  hostages 
taken  by  Chechen  guerrillas  near  Pyatigorsk  in  Russian  terri- 
tory perished  during  an  unsuccessful  rescue  operation  by  the 
MVD.  The  FSK  armed  Chechen  opposition  forces,  which 
launched  several  unsuccessful  attacks  against  the  Dudayev  gov- 
ernment in  the  fall  of  1994.  When  Russian  conventional  forces 
finally  invaded  Chechnya  in  December,  they  received  substan- 
tial support  from  troops  of  the  FSK,  its  successor  the  FSB,  and 
the  MVD.  The  FSB  and  MVD  remained  part  of  an  uneasy  occu- 
pation force  through  mid-1996  (see  Chechnya,  ch.  9). 

Crime 

The  liberalizing  changes  of  the  post-Soviet  era  brought  new 
types  of  crime,  many  of  them  associated  with  economic  activi- 
ties that  had  not  existed  until  1992.  As  the  opportunities  for 
legal  commercial  initiatives  expanded  rapidly,  so  did  the 
opportunities  to  defraud  Russian  citizens  inexperienced  in  eco- 
nomic matters  and  to  take  advantage  of  Russia's  complete  lack 
of  laws  covering  many  types  of  crime,  including  the  organized 
extraction  of  protection  money  from  economic  enterprises. 

Crime  in  the  Soviet  Era 

Because  the  Soviet  Union  did  not  publish  comprehensive 


571 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

crime  statistics,  comparison  of  its  crime  rates  with  those  of 
other  countries  is  difficult.  According  to  Western  experts,  rob- 
beries, murders,  and  other  violent  crimes  were  much  less  prev- 
alent than  in  the  United  States  because  of  the  Soviet  Union's 
larger  police  presence,  strict  gun  controls,  and  relatively  low 
incidence  of  drug  abuse.  By  contrast,  white-collar  economic 
crime  permeated  the  Soviet  system.  Bribery  and  covert  pay- 
ments for  goods  and  services  were  universal,  mainly  because  of 
the  paucity  of  goods  and  services  on  the  open  market.  Theft  of 
state  property  was  practiced  routinely  by  employees,  as  were 
various  forms  of  petty  theft.  In  the  last  years  of  the  Soviet 
Union,  the  government  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  (in  office 
1985-91)  made  a  concerted  effort  to  curtail  such  white-collar 
crime.  Revelations  of  corruption  scandals  involving  high-level 
party  employees  appeared  regularly  in  the  Soviet  news  media, 
and  many  arrests  and  prosecutions  resulted  from  such  discov- 
eries. 

The  Crime  Wave  of  the  1 990s 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  crime  statistics  moved  sharply 
and  uniformly  upward.  From  1991  to  1992,  the  number  of  offi- 
cially reported  crimes  and  the  overall  crime  rate  each  showed  a 
27  percent  increase;  the  crime  rate  nearly  doubled  between 
1985  and  1992.  By  the  early  1990s,  theft,  burglary,  and  other 
acts  against  property  accounted  for  about  two-thirds  of  all 
crime  in  Russia.  Of  particular  concern  to  citizens,  however,  was 
the  rapid  growth  of  violent  crime,  including  gruesome  homi- 
cides. 

Crime  Statistics 

Moscow's  1995  statistics  included  93,560  crimes,  of  which 
18,500  were  white-collar  crimes — an  increase  of  8.3  percent 
over  1994.  Among  white-collar  crimes,  swindling  increased  67.2 
percent,  and  extortion  37.5  percent,  in  1995.  Among  the  con- 
ventional crimes  reported,  murder  and  attempted  murder 
increased  1.5  percent,  rape  6.5  percent,  burglaries  6.6  percent, 
burglaries  accompanied  by  violence  20.8  percent,  and  serious 
crimes  by  teenagers  2.2  percent.  The  rate  of  crime-solving  by 
the  Moscow  militia  (police)  rose  in  1995  from  57.7  percent  to 
64.9  percent,  but  that  statistic  was  bolstered  substantially  by  suc- 
cess in  solving  minor  crimes;  the  projected  rate  of  solving  bur- 
glaries was  18.8  percent,  of^  murders  42.2  percent,  and  of 
crimes  involving  use  of  a  firearm,  31.4  percent.  Moscow  and  St. 


572 


Internal  Security 


Petersburg  were  the  centers  of  automobile  theft,  which 
increased  dramatically  through  the  first  half  of  the  1990s.  In 
Moscow  an  estimated  fifty  cars  were  stolen  per  day,  with  the 
estimated  yearly  total  for  Russia  between  100,000  and  150,000. 
In  the  first  quarter  of  1994,  Russia  averaged  eighty-four  mur- 
ders a  day.  Many  of  those  crimes  were  contract  killings  attrib- 
uted to  criminal  organizations.  In  1994  murder  victims 
included  three  deputies  of  the  State  Duma,  one  journalist,  a 
priest,  the  head  of  a  union,  several  local  officials,  and  more 
than  thirty  businesspeople  and  bankers.  Most  of  those  crimes 
went  unsolved. 

The  1995  national  crime  total  exceeded  1.3  million,  includ- 
ing 30,600  murders.  Crime  experts  predicted  that  the  murder 
total  would  reach  50,000  in  1996.  In  1995  some  248  regular 
militia  officers  were  killed  in  the  line  of  duty. 

Confiscation  of  firearms,  possession  of  which  has  been  iden- 
tified as  another  grave  social  problem,  increased  substantially 
in  1995,  according  to  the  Moscow  militia's  Regional  Organized 
Crime  Directorate.  About  3  million  firearms  were  registered  in 
1995,  but  the  number  of  unregistered  guns  was  assumed  to  far 
exceed  that  figure.  Military  weapons  are  stolen  frequently  and 
sold  to  gangsters;  in  1993  nearly  60,000  cases  of  such  theft  were 
reported,  involving  machine  guns,  hand  grenades,  and  explo- 
sives, among  other  weapons  (see  Crime  in  the  Military,  ch.  9). 
The  ready  availability  of  firearms  has  made  the  work  of  the 
poorly  armed  militia  more  dangerous. 

Organized  Crime 

By  early  1994,  crime  was  second  only  to  the  national  econ- 
omy as  a  domestic  issue  in  Russia.  In  January  1994,  a  report 
prepared  for  President  Yeltsin  by  the  Analytical  Center  for 
Social  and  Economic  Policies  was  published  in  the  national 
daily  newspaper  Izvestiya.  According  to  the  center,  between  70 
and  80  percent  of  private  enterprises  and  commercial  banks 
were  forced  to  pay  protection  fees  to  criminal  organizations, 
which  in  Russia  received  the  generic  label  mafiya.  Unlike  orga- 
nized crime  in  other  countries,  which  controls  only  such  crimi- 
nal activities  as  drug  trafficking  and  gambling,  and  specific 
types  of  legitimate  enterprise  such  as  municipal  trash  collec- 
tion, the  Russian  crime  organizations  have  gained  strong  influ- 
ence in  a  wide  variety  of  economic  activities.  In  addition, 
beginning  with  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  weak- 
ening of  border  controls,  Russia  has  been  drawn  into  the  net- 


573 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

work  of  international  organized  crime.  In  this  way,  Russia  has 
become  a  major  conduit  for  the  movement  of  drugs,  contra- 
band, and  laundered  money  between  Europe  and  Asia.  In  1995 
an  estimated  150  criminal  organizations  with  transnational 
links  were  operating  in  Russia. 

Among  the  main  targets  of  organized  crime  are  businesses 
and  banks  in  Russia's  newly  privatized  economy  and  foreign- 
ers— both  individual  and  corporate — in  possession  of  luxury 
goods  or  the  hard  currency  (see  Glossary)  to  purchase  them. 
Many  of  Russia's  mafiya  figures  began  their  "careers"  in  the 
black  market  during  the  communist  era.  They  are  now  able  to 
operate  overtly  and  are  increasingly  brazen.  Many  current  and 
former  government  officials  and  businesspeople  have  been 
identified  as  belonging  to  the  mafiya  network. 

The  1994  report  to  the  president  described  collusion 
between  criminal  gangs  and  local  law  enforcement  officials, 
which  made  controlling  crime  especially  difficult.  The  enforce- 
ment problem,  which  became  acute  in  1993,  was  exacerbated 
by  overtaxation,  confusing  regulations,  and  the  absence  of  an 
effective  judicial  system.  By  1993  criminal  groups  had  moved 
into  commercial  ventures,  using  racketeering,  kidnapping,  and 
murder  to  intimidate  competition.  In  1994  an  MVD  official 
estimated  that  there  were  5,700  criminal  gangs  in  Russia,  with  a 
membership  of  approximately  100,000. 

In  March  1995,  Vladislav  List'ev,  a  prominent  television  jour- 
nalist, was  assassinated.  List'ev  had  been  a  supporter  of  efforts 
to  stop  corruption  in  state  television,  where  large  amounts  of 
advertising  revenues  were  being  extorted  by  organized  crime. 
A  Russian  news  agency  reported  that,  between  1992  and  mid- 
1995,  there  had  been  eighty-three  attempts — forty-six  of  which 
were  successful — to  kill  bankers  and  businesspeople.  In  1996 
contract  killings  remained  a  regular  occurrence,  especially  in 
Moscow. 

Nuclear  Security 

Neither  civilian  nor  military  nuclear  facilities  have  adequate 
security.  Thefts  of  nuclear  materials  from  Russia  gained  inter- 
national attention  in  1993  and  1994.  In  1995  the  FSB  reported 
investigations  of  thirty  such  incidents.  Such  thefts  assumedly 
were  intended  to  supply  smuggling  operations  into  Iran  and 
Germany,  among  other  destinations.  Although  the  Russian  gov- 
ernment took  nominal  steps  to  improve  nuclear  security  early 
in  1995,  the  minister  of  internal  affairs  reported  that  80  per- 


574 


Internal  Security 


cent  of  nuclear  enterprises  lacked  checkpoints.  Western 
experts  pointed  to  the  potential  for  organized  criminals  to 
obtain  weapons-grade  nuclear  materials,  and  in  1996  new 
reports  described  lax  security  at  nuclear  installations. 

Terrorism 

Security  police  reported  that  between  1991  and  1993  the 
incidence  of  terrorist  bombings  rose  from  fifty  to  350.  The 
methods  used  by  organized  criminals  in  Russia  caused  experts 
to  include  Russia  as  a  likely  location  in  their  identification  of  a 
new  wave  of  world  terrorism  in  the  1990s.  Besides  organized 
crime,  a  second  factor  potentially  contributing  to  terrorism  is 
the  extreme  instability  of  economic  and  social  conditions:  high 
unemployment  and  job  insecurity,  friction  among  ethnic 
groups  and  between  urban  populations  and  job-seeking 
migrants  into  their  cities,  and  a  general  decline  in  the  standard 
of  living.  The  vulnerability  of  Russia's  isolated  transport  and 
pipeline  systems  and  the  proximity  of  hazardous-materials  cen- 
ters to  cities  further  increase  the  prospect  of  terrorist  activities. 
In  1995  terrorist  acts  and  two  major  instances  of  hostage  taking 
by  Chechen  separatists  promoted  fears  that  vulnerable  citizens 
and  locations  in  other  parts  of  Russia  might  be  targeted  by  sep- 
aratist groups.  In  December  1995,  an  international  conference 
on  terrorism  in  Ottawa  categorized  the  Budennovsk  hostage 
incident  of  June  1995 — in  which  Chechen  guerrillas  captured 
more  than  1,000  hostages  120  kilometers  inside  Russian  terri- 
tory— with  the  Oklahoma  City  bombing  and  Middle  Eastern 
terrorist  acts  as  examples  of  flagrant  international  terrorism. 

Narcotics 

In  the  mid-1990s,  narcotics  addiction  and  sales  play  a  grow- 
ing role  in  the  disruption  of  Russian  society.  This  trend  has 
been  promoted  by  an  adverse  economic  situation,  a  general 
lack  of  high-level  control  over  the  use  and  movement  of  nar- 
cotic substances,  and  the  continued  laxity  of  border  controls. 
Between  1993  and  1995,  the  annual  amount  of  seized  drugs 
increased  from  thirty-five  to  ninety  tons;  experts  believe  that 
Russia  has  the  largest  per  capita  drug  market  of  all  the  former 
Soviet  republics. 

According  to  the  Russian  government's  Center  for  the  Study 
of  Drug  Addiction,  in  early  1996  at  least  500,000  Russians  were 
dependent  on  illegal  drugs.  With  use  increasing  at  an  esti- 
mated rate  of  50  percent  per  year,  the  total  number  of  users 


575 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

was  estimated  at  2  million  in  1995.  Drug  traffickers,  supplied 
mainly  with  opium  from  Central  Asia  and  heroin  from  Iran, 
Pakistan,  and  Afghanistan,  have  targeted  Russia  as  a  market 
and  as  a  conduit  to  Western  markets.  In  the  early  1990s, 
cocaine  use  appeared  among  affluent  young  Russians,  and 
beginning  in  1993  the  interception  of  cocaine  shipments  in  St. 
Petersburg  indicated  that  South  American  producers  had 
entered  the  Russian  market.  Criminal  organizations  are 
believed  to  control  most  trafficking  and  distribution  in  Russia. 
Some  local  Russian  distributors  are  closely  linked  with  criminal 
groups  in  Central  Asia,  the  Caucasus,  and  Ukraine.  Russian  sol- 
diers and  officers  in  Afghanistan  and  later  in  Central  Asia 
became  active  in  smuggling  the  narcotics  easily  available  in 
those  countries  into  Russia.  Reportedly,  members  of  the  Rus- 
sian 201st  Motorized  Infantry  Division,  stationed  in  Tajikistan, 
have  established  a  profitable  enterprise  that  is  tacitly  accepted 
by  Russian  and  Tajikistani  authorities.  The  Moscow  State  Insti- 
tute of  International  Relations  has  reported  the  existence  of  a 
regular  smuggling  route  going  fromTajikistan  to  Russia's  Black 
Sea  port  of  Rostov-na-Donu  via  Turkmenistan,  and  from  there 
to  Western  Europe.  One  explanation  of  the  Russian  attack  on 
Chechnya,  published  in  the  independent  newspaper  Nezavisi- 
maya  gazeta,  was  that  it  was  a  reprisal  against  Chechen  president 
Dzhokar  Dudayev  for  demanding  more  protection  money  for 
narcotics  shipments  through  Chechnya  to  Rostov-na-Donu. 

Narcotics  production  in  Russia  also  is  rising.  In  1993  the  gov- 
ernment seized  215  laboratories,  many  of  them  small-scale 
amphetamine  producers  who  used  stolen  government  equip- 
ment. Newly  privatized  chemical  laboratories  are  more  difficult 
to  monitor  than  were  Soviet-era  state  facilities.  Opium  poppies 
and  marijuana  are  grown  in  southern  Russia,  although  cultiva- 
tion is  illegal.  In  1995  an  MVD  official  estimated  that  about  1 
million  hectares  of  wild  cannabis  was  growing  and  easily  avail- 
able in  Siberia;  opium  cultivation  also  is  believed  to  be  increas- 
ing. 

The  laundering  of  drug  money  is  encouraged  by  Russia's  lax 
monetary  regulations  and  controls.  Some  local  banks  are  con- 
trolled by  criminal  groups  that  use  them  to  launder  profits 
from  illegal  activities,  including  drug  sales.  According  to  one 
1995  estimate,  as  many  as  25  percent  of  Moscow's  commercial 
banks  are  part  of  this  operation.  Legislation  against  money 
laundering  was  proposed  but  had  not  been  passed  as  of  mid- 
1996. 


576 


Internal  Security 


In  1994  the  Yeltsin  administration  formed  an  interministe- 
rial  counternarcotics  committee,  involving  twenty-four  agen- 
cies, to  coordinate  drug  policy.  In  1995  a  three-year  antidrug 
program  was  approved  to  support  interdiction  and  drug  treat- 
ment facilities.  The  program  also  was  intended  to  criminalize 
drug  use,  extend  sentences  for  drug  trafficking,  and  establish  a 
pharmaceuticals-monitoring  process.  In  1995  the  full-time  staff 
of  the  anti-drug-trafficking  department  of  the  MVD  increased 
from  about  3,500  to  4,000.  The  State  Customs  Committee 
increased  its  drug  control  staff  by  350  and  added  fifty  field 
offices,  and  the  Federal  Border  Service  created  an  antidrug 
force.  The  Moscow  City  Council  instituted  drug  education  pro- 
grams in  some  city  schools  in  1993,  and  several  private  organi- 
zations have  sponsored  national  programs  to  curb  demand. 
The  government  has  not  aggressively  addressed  the  rehabilita- 
tion of  drug  addicts  or  the  reduction  of  demand,  however;  in 
1995  an  estimated  90  percent  of  Russia's  drug  addicts  went 
untreated  (see  Health  Conditions,  ch.  5). 

The  Russian  government  has  signed  a  number  of  interna- 
tional conventions  on  narcotics  (responsibility  for  some  of 
which  it  inherited  from  the  Soviet  Union),  including  the  1988 
United  Nations  Convention  on  Narcotic  Drugs.  Russia  will  not 
be  in  full  compliance  with  the  convention,  however,  until  it  has 
stricter  controls  on  production  and  distribution  and  tougher 
criminal  penalties  for  possession  of  drugs.  The  United  States 
government  has  offered  Russia  advice  and  training  courses  on 
various  aspects  of  narcotics  control.  A  mutual  legal-assistance 
agreement  with  the  United  States  went  into  effect  in  early 
1996,  and  the  Federal  Border  Service  has  memorandums  of 
understanding  on  narcotics  cooperation  with  the  United  States 
Coast  Guard  and  with  Kyrgyzstan  and  Tajikistan. 

The  Criminal  Justice  System 

The  Federal  Security  Service  (FSB)  has  a  staff  of  several 
thousand  responsible  for  investigating  crimes  of  national  and 
international  scope  such  as  terrorism,  smuggling,  treason,  vio- 
lations of  secrecy  laws,  and  large-scale  economic  crime  and  cor- 
ruption— an  area  of  jurisdiction  similar  to  that  of  the  United 
States  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI).  Several  other 
state  organizations  also  have  designated  criminal  investigatory 
responsibilities.

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  (MVD) 

Unlike  the  successor  agencies  to  the  KGB,  the  Ministry  of 
Internal  Affairs  (Ministerstvo  vnutrennikh  del — MVD)  did  not 
undergo  extensive  reorganization  after  1991.  The  MVD  carries 
out  regular  police  functions,  including  maintenance  of  public 
order  and  criminal  investigation.  It  also  has  responsibility  for 
fire  fighting  and  prevention,  traffic  control,  automobile  regis- 
tration, transportation  security,  issuance  of  visas  and  passports, 
and  administration  of  labor  camps  and  most  prisons. 

In  1996  the  MVD  was  estimated  to  have  540,000  personnel, 
including  the  regular  militia  (police  force)  and  MVD  special 
troops  but  not  including  the  ministry's  Internal  Troops.  The 
MVD  operates  at  both  the  central  and  local  levels.  The  central 
system  is  administered  from  the  ministry  office  in  Moscow.  As 
of  mid-1996,  the  minister  of  internal  affairs  was  General  Ana- 
toliy  Kulikov.  He  replaced  Viktor  Yerin,  who  was  dismissed  in 
response  to  State  Duma  demands  after  the  MVD  mishandled 
the  1995  Budennovsk  hostage  crisis. 

MVD  agencies  exist  at  all  levels  from  the  national  to  the 
municipal.  MVD  agencies  at  lower  operational  levels  conduct 
preliminary  investigations  of  crimes.  They  also  perform  the 
ministry's  policing,  motor  vehicle  inspection,  and  fire  and  traf- 
fic control  duties.  MVD  salaries  are  generally  lower  than  those 
paid  in  other  agencies  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  Report- 
edly, staffers  are  poorly  trained  and  equipped,  and  corruption 
is  widespread. 

Until  1990  Russia's  regular  militia  was  under  the  direct 
supervision  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  of  the  Soviet 
Union.  At  that  time,  the  Russian  Republic  established  its  own 
MVD,  which  assumed  control  of  the  republic's  militia.  In  the 
late  1980s,  the  Gorbachev  regime  had  attempted  to  improve 
training,  tighten  discipline,  and  decentralize  the  administra- 
tion of  the  militia  throughout  the  Soviet  Union  so  that  it  might 
respond  better  to  local  needs  and  deal  more  effectively  with 
drug  trafficking  and  organized  crime.  Some  progress  was  made 
toward  these  objectives  despite  strong  opposition  from  conser- 
vative elements  in  the  CPSU  leadership.  However,  after  1990 
the  redirection  of  MVD  resources  to  the  Internal  Troops  and  to 
the  MVD's  new  local  riot  squads  undercut  militia  reform.  In  the 
August  1991  coup  against  the  Gorbachev  government,  most 
Russian  police  remained  inactive,  although  some  in  Moscow 
joined  the  Yeltsin  forces  that  opposed  the  overthrow  of  the  gov- 
ernment.

In  early  1996,  a  reorganization  plan  was  proposed  for  the 
MVD,  with  the  aim  of  more  effective  crime  prevention.  The 
plan  called  for  increasing  the  police  force  by  as  many  as  90,000, 
but  funding  was  not  available  for  such  expansion.  Meanwhile, 
the  MVD  recruited  several  thousand  former  military  person- 
nel, whose  experience  reduced  the  need  for  police  training.  At 
the  end  of  1995,  the  MVD  reported  debts  of  US$717  million, 
including  US$272  million  in  overdue  wages.  In  February  1996, 
guards  at  a  jail  and  a  battalion  of  police  escorts  went  on  a  hun- 
ger strike;  at  that  point,  some  of  the  MVD's  Internal  Troops 
had  not  been  paid  for  three  months.  Minister  of  Internal 
Affairs  Kulikov  described  the  ministry's  1996  state  budget  allo- 
cation of  US$5.2  billion  as  wholly  inadequate  to  fulfill  its  mis- 
sions. Participation  in  the  Chechnya  campaign  added 
enormously  to  ministry  expenditures. 

The  MVD's  militia  is  used  for  ordinary  policing  functions 
such  as  law  enforcement  on  the  streets,  crowd  control,  and  traf- 
fic control.  As  part  of  a  trend  toward  decentralization,  some 
municipalities,  including  Moscow,  have  formed  their  own  mili- 
tias, which  cooperate  with  their  MVD  counterpart.  Although  a 
new  law  on  self-government  supports  such  local  law  enforce- 


579

ment  agencies,  the  Yeltsin  administration  attempted  to  head 
off  further  moves  toward  independence  by  strictly  limiting 
local  powers.  The  regular  militia  does  not  carry  guns  or  other 
weapons  except  in  emergency  situations,  such  as  the  parlia- 
mentary crisis  of  1993,  when  it  was  called  upon  to  fight  antigov- 
ernment  crowds  in  the  streets  of  Moscow. 

The  militia  is  divided  into  local  public  security  units  and 
criminal  police.  The  security  units  run  local  police  stations, 
temporary  detention  centers,  and  the  State  Traffic  Inspec- 
torate. They  deal  with  crimes  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
criminal  police  and  are  charged  with  routine  maintenance  of 
public  order.  The  criminal  police  are  divided  into  organiza- 
tions responsible  for  combating  particular  types  of  crime.  The 
Main  Directorate  for  Organized  Crime  (Glavnoye  upravleniye 
organizovannogo  prestupleniya — GUOP)  works  with  other 
agencies  such  as  the  MVD's  specialized  rapid-response  detach- 
ments; in  1995  special  GUOP  units  were  established  to  deal 
with  contract  killings  and  other  violent  crimes  against  individu- 
als. The  Federal  Tax  Police  Service  deals  primarily  with  tax  eva- 
sion and  similar  crimes.  In  an  attempt  to  improve  Russia's 
notoriously  inefficient  tax  collection  operation,  the  Federal 
Tax  Police  Service  received  authority  in  1995  to  carry  out  pre- 
liminary criminal  investigations  independently.  The  1996  bud- 
get authorized  a  staff  of  38,000  for  this  agency. 

Throughout  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  Russia's  militia  func- 
tioned with  minimal  arms,  equipment,  and  support  from  the 
national  legal  system.  The  inadequacy  of  the  force  became  par- 
ticularly apparent  in  the  wave  of  organized  crime  that  began 
sweeping  over  Russia  after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union. 
Many  highly  qualified  individuals  have  moved  from  the  militia 
into  better-paying  jobs  in  the  field  of  private  security,  which  has 
expanded  to  meet  the  demand  of  companies  needing  protec- 
tion from  organized  crime.  Frequent  bribe  taking  among  the 
remaining  members  of  the  militia  has  damaged  the  force's  pub- 
lic credibility.  Numerous  revelations  of  participation  by  militia 
personnel  in  murders,  prostitution  rings,  information  ped- 
dling, and  tolerance  of  criminal  acts  have  created  a  general 
public  perception  that  all  police  are  at  least  taking  bribes.  Brib- 
ery of  police  officers  to  avoid  arrest  for  traffic  violations  and 
petty  crimes  is  a  routine  and  expected  occurrence. 

In  a  1995  poll  of  the  public,  only  5  percent  of  respondents 
expressed  confidence  in  the  ability  of  the  militia  to  deal  with 
crime  in  their  city.  Human  rights  organizations  have  accused 


580

the  Moscow  militia  of  racism  in  singling  out  non-Slavic  individ- 
uals (especially  immigrants  from  Russia's  Caucasus  republics), 
physical  attacks,  unjustified  detention,  and  other  rights  viola- 
tions. In  1995  Kulikov  conducted  a  high-profile  "Clean  Hands 
Campaign"  to  purge  the  MVD  police  forces  of  corrupt  ele- 
ments. In  its  first  year,  this  limited  operation  caught  several 
highly  placed  MVD  officials  collecting  bribes,  indicating  a  high 
level  of  corruption  throughout  the  agency.  According  to 
experts,  the  main  causes  of  corruption  are  insufficient  funding 
to  train  and  equip  personnel  and  pay  them  adequate  wages, 
poor  work  discipline,  lack  of  accountability,  and  fear  of  repris- 
als from  organized  criminals. 

The  Special  Forces  Police  Detachment  (Otryad  militsii 
osobogo  naznacheniya — OMON),  commonly  known  as  the 
Black  Berets,  is  a  highly  trained  elite  branch  of  the  public  secu- 
rity force  of  the  MVD  militia.  Established  in  1987,  OMON  is 
assigned  to  emergency  situations  such  as  hostage  crises,  wide- 
spread public  disturbances,  and  terrorist  threats.  In  the  Soviet 
period,  OMON  forces  also  were  used  to  quell  unrest  in  rebel- 
lious republics.  In  the  1990s,  OMON  units  have  been  stationed 
at  transportation  hubs  and  population  centers.  The  Moscow 
contingent,  reportedly  2,000  strong,  receives  support  from  the 
mayor's  office  and  the  city's  internal  affairs  office  as  well  as 
from  the  MVD  budget.  OMON  units  have  the  best  and  most 
up-to-date  weapons  and  combat  equipment  available,  and  they 
enjoy  a  reputation  for  courage  and  effectiveness. 

The  MVD's  Internal  Troops,  estimated  to  number  260,000  to 
280,000  in  mid-1996,  are  better  equipped  and  trained  than  the 
regular  militia.  The  size  of  the  force,  which  is  staffed  by  both 
conscripts  and  volunteers,  has  grown  steadily  through  the  mid- 
1990s,  although  the  troop  commander  has  reported  serious 
shortages  of  officers.  Critics  have  noted  that  the  Internal 
Troops  have  more  divisions  in  a  combat-ready  state  than  do  the 
regular  armed  forces  (see  Force  Structure,  ch.  9). 

According  to  the  Law  on  Internal  Troops,  issued  in  October 
1992,  the  functions  of  the  Internal  Troops  are  to  ensure  public 
order;  guard  key  state  installations,  including  nuclear  power 
plants;  guard  prisons  and  labor  camps  (a  function  that  was  to 
end  in  1996);  and  contribute  to  the  territorial  defense  of  the 
nation.  It  was  under  the  last  mandate  that  Internal  Troops  were 
deployed  in  large  numbers  after  the  December  1994  invasion 
of  Chechnya.  In  November  1995,  MVD  troops  in  Chechnya 
totaled  about  23,500.  This  force  included  unknown  propor- 


581

tions  of  Internal  Troops,  specialized  rapid-response  troops,  and 
special  military  detachments.  Internal  Troops  are  equipped 
with  guns  and  combat  equipment  to  deal  with  serious  crimes, 
terrorism,  and  other  extraordinary  threats  to  public  order.  In 
1995  the  crime  rate  among  Internal  Troops  personnel  dou- 
bled. A  contributing  factor  was  a  steep  increase  in  desertions 
that  coincided  with  service  in  Chechnya,  where  the  Internal 
Troops  were  routinely  used  for  street  patrols  in  1995. 

The  Procuracy 

In  the  Soviet  criminal  justice  system,  the  Procuracy  was  the 
most  powerful  institution  dealing  with  nonpolitical  crimes. 
Since  1991  the  agency  has  retained  its  dual  responsibility  for 
the  administration  of  judicial  oversight  and  for  criminal  investi- 
gations— which  means,  essentially,  that  prosecution  of  crimes 
and  findings  of  guilt  or  innocence  are  overseen  by  the  same 
office.  As  it  was  under  the  Soviet  system,  the  Procuracy  in  the 
1990s  is  a  unified,  centralized  agency  with  branches  in  all  sub- 
national  jurisdictions,  including  cities.  The  chief  of  the  agency 
is  the  procurator  general,  who  is  appointed  by  the  president 
with  the  approval  of  the  State  Duma.  (Under  the  Soviet  system, 
the  Supreme  Soviet  appointed  the  procurator  general.) 

Proposed  reforms  of  the  notoriously  corrupt  and  inefficient 
Procuracy  had  not  yet  been  enacted  by  the  Russian  govern- 
ment as  of  mid-1996,  so  the  agency  continued  to  function  in 
much  the  same  way  as  it  did  in  the  Soviet  period.  Experts  did 
not  believe  that  a  new  law  on  the  Procuracy,  proposed  in  1995 
and  1996,  would  establish  a  reliable  oversight  system  over  secu- 
rity-agency and  regular  police  operations.  In  the  meantime, 
procurators  continued  to  arrest  citizens  without  constitution- 
ally mandated  arrest  warrants,  and  the  general  surveillance 
departments  of  the  Procuracy  continued  to  spy  on  law-abiding 
groups  and  individuals. 

In  1995  about  28,000  procurators  were  active  at  some  level  in 
the  Russian  Federation.  Appointed  to  five-year  terms,  procura- 
tors must  have  a  postgraduate  education  in  jurisprudence.  The 
Procuracy  employs  a  large  number  of  investigators  who  carry 
out  preliminary  investigations  in  what  are  called  specific  areas 
of  competence.  Special  investigators  are  designated  for  cases 
identified  as  "essentially  important"  by  state  authorities.  The 
Procuracy  also  has  several  institutions  for  research  and  educa- 
tion attached  to  it.

Criminal  Law  Reform  in  the  1990s 

In  the  mid-1990s,  several  efforts  were  made  to  pass  a  Crimi- 
nal Code  of  the  Russian  Federation  to  replace  the  inadequate 
and  antiquated  Criminal  Code  of  the  RSFSR,  which  was  passed 
in  the  1960s  and  had  remained  the  fundamental  law  of  the 
land,  with  numerous  amendments,  since  that  time.  In  Decem- 
ber 1995,  Yeltsin,  heeding  MVD  objections  to  certain  articles, 
vetoed  a  code  that  had  been  developed  by  his  own  State  Law 
Directorate  and  passed  by  parliament.  No  amended  code  was 
expected  until  after  the  presidential  election  of  July  1996. 
Meanwhile,  Russia  lacked  laws  on  organized  crime  and  corrup- 
tion under  which  maflya  and  economic  crimes  could  be  prose- 
cuted. 

In  the  absence  of  a  comprehensive  overhaul  of  the  Criminal 
Code,  Yeltsin  responded  to  the  growing  problem  of  crime  by 
enacting  measures  that  broadly  expanded  police  powers.  In 
June  1994,  he  issued  a  presidential  decree,  Urgent  Measures  to 
Implement  the  Program  to  Step  Up  the  Fight  Against  Crime. 
The  decree  included  major  steps  to  increase  the  efficiency  of 
the  law  enforcement  agencies,  including  material  incentives 
for  the  staff  and  better  equipment  and  resources.  The  decree 
also  called  for  an  increase  of  52,000  in  the  strength  of  the  MVD 
Internal  Troops  and  for  greater  coordination  in  the  operations 
of  the  Federal  Counterintelligence  Service  (FSK),  the  MVD, 
and  other  law  enforcement  bodies.  Control  over  the  issuing  of 
entry  visas  and  the  private  acquisition  of  photocopiers  was  to 
be  tightened.  The  decree  also  mandated  the  preparation  of 
laws  broadening  police  rights  to  conduct  searches  and  to  carry 
weapons. 

Yeltsin's  anticrime  decree  had  the  stated  purpose  of  preserv- 
ing the  security  of  the  society  and  the  state;  however,  the  system 
of  urgent  measures  it  introduced  had  the  effect  of  reducing 
the  rights  of  individuals  accused  of  committing  crimes.  Under 
the  new  guidelines,  individuals  suspected  of  serious  offenses 
could  be  detained  up  to  thirty  days  without  being  formally 
charged.  During  that  time,  suspects  could  be  interrogated  and 
their  financial  affairs  examined.  The  secrecy  regulations  of 
banks  and  commercial  enterprises  would  not  protect  suspects 
in  such  cases.  Intelligence  service  representatives  have  the 
authority  to  enter  any  premises  without  a  warrant,  to  examine 
private  documents,  and  to  search  automobiles,  their  drivers, 
and  their  passengers.  Human  rights  activists  protested  the 
decree  as  a  violation  of  the  1993  constitution's  protection  of 


583 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

individuals  from  arbitrary  police  power  (see  Civil  Rights,  ch. 
7).  Already  in  1992,  Yeltsin  had  expanded  the  infamous  Article 
70,  a  Soviet-era  device  used  to  silence  political  dissent,  which 
criminalized  any  form  of  public  demand  for  change  in  the  con- 
stitutional system,  as  well  as  the  formation  of  any  assemblage 
calling  for  such  measures. 

Meanwhile,  the  Russian  police  immediately  began  acting  on 
their  broad  mandate  to  fight  crime.  In  the  summer  of  1994,  the 
Moscow  MVD  carried  out  a  citywide  operation  called  Hurri- 
cane that  employed  about  20,000  crack  troops  and  resulted  in 
759  arrests.  A  short  time  later,  the  FSK  reported  that  its  opera- 
tives had  arrested  members  of  a  right-wing  terrorist  group,  the 
so-called  Werewolf  Legion,  who  were  planning  to  bomb  Mos- 
cow cinemas.  Although  crime  continued  to  rise  after  Yeltsin's 
decree,  the  rate  of  crime  solving  improved  from  its  1993  level 
of  51  percent  to  65  percent  in  1995,  assumedly  because  of 
expanded  police  powers. 

Although  the  Russian  parliament  opposed  many  of  Yeltsin's 
policies,  the  majority  of  deputies  were  even  more  inclined  than 
Yeltsin  to  expand  police  authority  at  the  expense  of  individual 
rights.  In  July  1995,  the  State  Duma  passed  the  new  Law  on 
Operational-Investigative  Activity,  which  had  been  introduced 
by  the  Yeltsin  administration  to  replace  Article  70.  The  law  wid- 
ened the  list  of  agencies  entitled  to  conduct  investigations,  at 
the  same  time  broadening  the  powers  of  all  investigatory  agen- 
cies beyond  those  stipulated  in  the  earlier  law. 

The  1995  draft  Criminal  Code  included  an  article  specifi- 
cally prohibiting  "conspiracy  with  the  aim  of  seizing  power  and 
forcibly  changing  the  constitutional  form  of  government,"  an 
activity  subject  to  a  sentence  of  up  to  life  imprisonment.  The 
new  law  opened  the  concept  of  conspiracy  to  broad  interpreta- 
tion by  state  authorities,  varying  from  a  meeting  held  by  the 
leadership  of  an  opposition  party  to  a  simple  telephone  conver- 
sation between  two  citizens. 

The  draft  code  also  broadened  the  law  on  violations  of  civil 
rights  on  the  basis  of  nationality  or  race,  which  carries  a  maxi- 
mum sentence  of  five  years.  As  in  the  case  of  conspiracy  and 
political  statutes,  the  ambiguity  of  the  nationality  and  race  law 
opened  the  door  for  serious  abuses  of  individual  rights.  Prose- 
cutors and  judges  were  granted  wide  latitude  in  deciding  what 
constitute  "acts  directed  at  incitement  of  social,  national,  racial, 
or  religious  hostility  or  discord."  Such  a  charge  could  be  lev- 
eled easily  in  a  society  with  a  huge  variety  of  ethnic  and  reli- 


584 


Internal  Security 


gious  groups,  particularly  groups  with  existing  claims  of 
autonomy  or  traditions  of  hostility  toward  one  another  (see 
Ethnic  Composition,  ch.  4). 

Many  legal  experts  considered  the  new  draft  Criminal  Code, 
which  is  a  synthesis  of  presidential  and  State  Duma  proposals, 
to  be  a  significant  improvement  over  the  old  code.  But,  unlike 
Western  states,  Russia  does  not  have  a  tradition  of  respect  for 
legal  rights  or  a  well-established,  balanced  system  of  justice  to 
interpret  and  administer  the  laws.  Many  of  the  laws  adopted  in 
the  early  1990s  concern  crimes  whose  investigation  is  delegated 
to  the  security  police,  which  have  a  history  of  human  rights 
abuses  and  were  not  placed  under  effective  oversight  by  the 
reforms  of  the  early  1990s.  Thus,  in  the  atmosphere  of  relative 
political  pluralism  and  freedom  of  expression  in  the  first  years 
of  the  Yeltsin  administration,  security  agents  still  sometimes 
take  advantage  of  the  law  to  employ  KGB-style  tactics. 

Despite  a  lack  of  sympathy  for  personal  liberty,  in  the  early 
1990s  the  Yeltsin  administration  made  some  reforms  in  the 
legal  system  to  protect  the  rights  of  the  individual.  In  June 
1992,  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  was  amended  to  give  a 
detainee  the  right  to  legal  counsel  immediately,  rather  than,  as 
in  the  past,  only  after  initial  questioning.  A  detainee's  right  to 
demand  a  judicial  review  of  the  legality  and  grounds  for  deten- 
tion also  was  recognized.  In  practice,  however,  these  changes 
often  have  been  offset  by  other  laws  intended  to  protect  the 
state  at  the  expense  of  the  individual.  The  clearest  example  is 
Yeltsin's  sweeping  anticrime  decree  of  1992,  but  other 
instances  have  followed.  In  March  1995,  Yeltsin  issued  a  decree 
against  fascist  organizations  and  practices,  which  gave  the  secu- 
rity police  broad  new  authority  to  arrest  and  investigate  sus- 
pects. Under  the  1995  draft  Criminal  Code,  a  person  under 
arrest  could  not  appeal  to  the  courts  to  protest  his  or  her  con- 
finement, but  only  to  the  procurator.  The  president  also  could 
appoint  a  special  prosecutor  to  bring  "highly  placed  individu- 
als" to  justice,  thus  undermining  the  principle  of  independent 
judges.  The  new  code  also  extended  the  maximum  period  of 
internment  of  suspects  without  formal  charges  from  three  to 
seven  days,  although  the  counsel  for  the  defense  could  not 
become  acquainted  with  the  materials  of  the  criminal  case 
until  after  the  preliminary  investigation  had  been  completed. 

Secrecy  Laws 

The  passage  of  a  new  secrecy  law  in  1993  indicated  that  the 


585 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

Yeltsin  government  was  not  prepared  to  abjure  the  protection 
of  state  secrets  as  a  rationale  for  controlling  the  activities  of 
Russian  citizens.  The  secrecy  law  of  1993,  harshly  criticized  by 
human  rights  activists,  set  forth  in  detail  the  procedure  for 
labeling  and  protecting  information  whose  dispersal  would 
constitute  a  danger  to  the  state.  The  concept  of  secrecy  was 
given  a  broad  interpretation.  The  law  prescribed  secret  classifi- 
cations for  information  on  foreign  policy,  economics,  national 
defense,  intelligence,  and  counterintelligence.  However,  a 
more  specific  description  of  the  classification  process,  includ- 
ing which  specific  types  of  information  were  to  be  classified  as 
secret  and  which  agencies  and  departments  were  authorized  to 
classify  information,  was  to  be  made  public  at  a  later  date. 

In  general,  the  security  police  under  Yeltsin  do  not  use 
secrecy  laws  to  prosecute  individuals,  but  there  have  been 
exceptions.  In  October  1992,  officers  from  the  Ministry  of 
Security  arrested  two  chemical  scientists,  Vil1  Mirzayanov  and 
Lev  Fedorov,  for  having  written  an  article  on  current  Russian 
chemical  weapons  research  in  a  widely  circulated  daily  newspa- 
per. The  article's  revelation  was  embarrassing  to  the  Yeltsin  gov- 
ernment because  Russia  had  claimed  it  was  no  longer 
conducting  such  research.  Although  Mirzayanov  was  brought 
to  trial  in  early  1994,  public  and  international  protest  caused 
the  Yeltsin  government  to  release  him  two  months  later.  In  a 
landmark  decision,  the  procurator's  office  awarded  Mirzayanov 
about  US$15,500  in  damages  for  having  been  illegally 
detained. 

How  the  System  Works 

According  to  Russian  criminal  procedure,  officers  of  the 
MVD,  the  Federal  Security  Service  (FSB),  or  the  Procuracy  can 
arrest  an  individual  on  suspicion  of  having  committed  a  crime. 
Ordinary  crimes,  including  murder,  come  under  the  jurisdic- 
tion of  the  MVD;  the  FSB  and  the  Procuracy  are  authorized  to 
deal  with  crimes  such  as  terrorism,  treason,  smuggling,  and 
large-scale  economic  malfeasance.  The  accused  has  the  right  to 
obtain  an  attorney  immediately  after  the  arrest,  and,  in  most 
cases,  the  accused  must  be  charged  officially  within  seventy-two 
hours  of  the  arrest.  In  some  circumstances,  the  period  of  con- 
finement without  charge  can  be  extended.  Once  the  case  is 
investigated,  it  is  assigned  to  a  court  for  trial.  Trials  are  public, 
with  the  exception  of  proceedings  involving  government 
secrets.

In  August  1995,  the  State  Duma  passed  a  law  giving  judges 
and  jurors  protection  against  illegal  influence  on  the  process  of 
trying  a  case.  To  the  extent  that  it  actually  is  practiced,  the  new 
law  is  a  significant  barrier  to  the  Soviet-era  practice  of  judges 
consulting  with  political  officials  before  rendering  verdicts. 
The  protection  of  jurors  became  a  concern  in  1995  as  jury  tri- 
als, outlawed  since  1918,  returned  on  an  experimental  basis  in 
nine  subnational  jurisdictions.  Between  January  and  Septem- 
ber 1995,  some  300  jury  trials  were  held  in  those  areas. 
Although  another  sixteen  jurisdictions  applied  to  begin  hold- 
ing jury  trials,  in  mid-1996  the  State  Duma  had  not  passed 
enabling  legislation.  In  1996  the  court  system  convicted  some 
99.5  percent  of  criminal  defendants,  although  only  80  percent 
were  convicted  injury  trials — about  the  same  percentage  as  in 
Western  courts.  Expansion  of  the  jury  system  faced  strong 
opposition  among  Russia's  police  and  prosecutors  because  the 
conviction  rate  is  much  lower  and  investigative  procedures  are 
held  to  much  higher  standards  under  such  a  system.  Mean- 
while, the  advent  of  trial  by  jury  and  a  nominally  independent 
judiciary  exposed  a  serious  problem:  in  1995  there  were  only 
about  20,000  private  attorneys  and  about  28,000  public  prose- 


587 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

cutors  in  all  of  Russia,  and  most  judges  who  had  functioned 
under  the  old  system  had  never  developed  genuine  juridical 
skills.  By  the  mid-1990s,  a  number  of  younger  judges  were 
actively  promoting  the  jury  system. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  claims  of  illegal  detention  received  some- 
what more  recognition  in  the  Russian  legal  system  than  they 
had  previously.  An  estimated  13,000  individuals  won  their 
release  by  court  order  in  1994 — about  20  percent  of  the  total 
number  who  claimed  illegal  detention  that  year.  In  general,  the 
criminal  justice  system  is  more  protective  of  individual  rights 
than  it  was  in  the  Soviet  period,  although  the  Mirzayanov  case 
demonstrated  that  substantial  obstacles  to  Western-style  juris- 
prudence remain  in  Russia's  legal  system. 

Capital  punishment  is  reserved  for  grave  crimes  such  as  mur- 
der and  terrorism;  it  cannot  be  inflicted  on  a  woman  or  on  an 
individual  less  than  eighteen  years  old.  In  1995  four  offenses — 
terrorist  acts,  terrorist  acts  against  a  representative  of  a  foreign 
state,  sabotage,  and  counterfeiting — were  removed  from  the 
list  of  capital  crimes.  In  March  1991,  Yeltsin  formed  a  thirteen- 
member  Pardons  Commission  of  volunteer  advisers  for  the  spe- 
cific purpose  of  considering  reductions  of  death  sentences. 
According  to  one  member  of  that  commission,  between  1991 
and  1994  the  incidence  of  capital  punishment  (inflicted  in  Rus- 
sia by  firing  squad)  dropped  sharply;  in  1994  only  four  execu- 
tions were  carried  out,  and  124  death  sentences  were 
commuted.  In  1995,  however,  the  political  pressure  generated 
by  Russia's  crime  wave  changed  the  totals  to  eighty-six  execu- 
tions and  only  six  commutations.  After  Yeltsin  repeatedly 
ignored  its  clemency  recommendations  in  1995,  the  Pardons 
Commission  reportedly  ceased  functioning  in  early  1996, 
despite  the  protests  of  Russian  and  international  human  rights 
organizations.  Russia's  membership  in  the  Council  of  Europe 
(see  Glossary),  which  became  official  in  January  1996,  requires 
an  immediate  moratorium  on  executions,  plus  complete  elimi- 
nation of  the  death  penalty  from  the  Criminal  Code  within 
three  years.  Russia's  execution  rate  rose  in  the  first  months  of 
1996  before  declining  sharply. 

Prisons 

In  the  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  had  few  conventional  prisons. 
About  99  percent  of  convicted  criminals  served  their  sentences 
in  labor  camps.  These  were  supervised  by  the  Main  Directorate 
for  Corrective  Labor  Camps  (Glavnoye  upravleniye  ispravi- 


588 


Internal  Security 


tel'no-trudovykh  lagerey — Gulag),  which  was  administered  by 
the  MVD.  The  camps  had  four  regimes  of  ascending  severity.  In 
the  strict-regime  camps,  inmates  worked  at  the  most  difficult 
jobs,  usually  outdoors,  and  received  meager  rations.  Jobs  were 
progressively  less  demanding  and  rations  better  in  the  three 
classifications  of  camps  with  more  clement  regimes.  The  system 
of  corrective  labor  was  viewed  by  Soviet  authorities  as  successful 
because  of  the  low  rate  of  recividism.  However,  in  the  opinion 
of  former  inmates  and  Western  observers,  prisons  and  labor 
camps  were  notorious  for  their  harsh  conditions,  arbitrary  and 
sadistic  treatment  of  prisoners,  and  flagrant  abuses  of  human 
rights.  In  1989  new  legislation,  emphasizing  rehabilitation 
rather  than  punishment,  was  drafted  to  "humanize"  the  Gulag 
system.  Nevertheless,  few  changes  occurred  in  the  conditions 
of  most  prisoners  before  the  end  of  the  Soviet  period  in  1991. 

In  the  post-Soviet  period,  all  prisons  and  labor  camps  except 
for  fourteen  detention  prisons  fell  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
MVD.  In  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  the  growth  of  crime  led  to  a 
rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  prisoners.  Because  of  overcrowding 
and  the  failure  to  build  new  prison  facilities,  conditions  in  pris- 
ons deteriorated  steadily  after  1991,  and  some  incidents  of 
Soviet-style  arbitrary  punishment  continued  to  be  reported.  In 
1994  a  Moscow  prison  designed  to  hold  8,500  inmates  was 
housing  well  over  17,000  shortly  after  its  completion.  Many 
prisons  are  unfit  for  habitation  because  of  insufficient  sanita- 
tion systems.  In  1995  Nezavisimaya  gazeta  reported  that  the 
capacity  of  isolation  wards  in  Moscow  and  St.  Petersburg  pris- 
ons had  been  exceeded  by  two  to  two-and-one-half  times. 
Observers  claimed  that  some  prisons  stopped  providing  food 
to  prisoners  for  months  at  a  time,  relying  instead  on  rations 
sent  from  outside.  The  lack  of  funding  also  led  to  a  crisis  in 
medical  care  for  prisoners.  In  1995  Yeltsin's  Human  Rights 
Commission  condemned  the  prison  system  for  continuing  to 
allow  violations  of  prisoners'  rights.  The  report  cited  lack  of 
expert  supervision  as  the  main  reason  that  such  practices, 
which  often  included  beatings,  were  not  reported  and  pun- 
ished. 

In  1995  conditions  in  the  penal  system  had  deteriorated  to 
the  point  that  the  State  Duma  began  calling  for  a  transfer  of 
prison  administration  from  the  MVD  to  the  Ministry  of  Justice. 
According  to  Western  experts,  however,  the  MVD's  Chief  Direc- 
torate for  Enforcement  of  Punishment  has  been  prevented 
from  improving  the  situation  by  funding  limitations,  personnel 


589 


Russia:  A  Country  Study 

problems,  and  lack  of  legislative  support,  rather  than  by  inter- 
nal shortcomings. 

By  the  mid-1990s,  Russian  penal  legislation  resembled  that 
enacted  in  Western  countries,  although  the  conditions  of 
detention  did  not.  Post-Soviet  legislation  has  abolished  arbi- 
trary or  inhumane  practices  such  as  bans  on  visitors  and  mail, 
head  shaving,  and  physical  abuse.  Also,  prison  officials  now  are 
required  to  protect  prisoners  who  have  received  threats,  and 
freedom  of  religious  practice  is  guaranteed.  Prisoners  are 
rewarded  for  good  behavior  by  being  temporarily  released  out- 
side the  prison;  in  1993  the  MVD  reported  a  97  percent  rate  of 
return  after  such  releases.  However,  the  penalty  for  violent 
escape  has  increased  to  eight  additional  years'  detention.  In 
1996  the  function  of  guarding  prisons  was  to  pass  completely 
from  the  MVD  to  local  prison  administrations,  and  a  complete 
restructuring  was  announced  for  that  year. 

Although  conditions  in  the  labor  camps  are  harsh,  those  in 
pretrial  detention  centers  are  even  worse.  According  to  the 
Society  for  the  Guardianship  of  Penitentiary  Institutions,  the 
government's  inability  to  implement  a  functional  system  of 
release  on  bail  meant  that  by  the  end  of  1994  some  233,500 
persons — more  than  20  percent  of  the  entire  prison  popula- 
tion— were  incarcerated  in  pretrial  detention  centers,  some- 
times for  a  period  longer  than  the  nominal  punishment  for  the 
crime  of  which  they  were  accused. 

In  1994  the  total  prison  population  was  estimated  at  slightly 
more  than  1  million  people,  of  whom  about  600,000  were  held 
in  labor  camps.  Of  the  latter  number,  about  21,600  were  said  to 
be  women  and  about  19,000  to  be  adolescents.  Among  the 
entire  prison  population  in  1994,  about  half  were  incarcerated 
for  violent  crimes,  60  percent  were  repeat  offenders,  and  more 
than  15  percent  were  alcoholics  or  drug  addicts. 

As  in  the  Soviet  period,  corrective-labor  institutions  have 
made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  national  economy.  In 
the  early  1990s,  industrial  output  in  the  camps  reached  an  esti- 
mated US$100  million,  and  forest-based  camps  added  about 
US$27  million,  chiefly  from  the  production  of  commercial 
lumber,  railroad  ties,  and  summer  cabins.  Because  the  camps 
supply  their  products  to  conventional  state  enterprises,  how- 
ever, they  have  suffered  from  the  decline  in  that  phase  of  Rus- 
sia's economy;  an  estimated  200,000  convicts  were  without  work 
in  the  camps  in  early  1994  (see  Economic  Conditions  in  Mid- 
1996,  ch.  6).  In  1995  the  chief  of  the  Directorate  for  Supervi- 


590 


Internal  Security 


sion  of  the  Legality  of  Prison  Punishment  reported  that  the 
population  of  labor  camps  exceeded  the  capacity  of  those  facil- 
ities by  an  average  of  50  percent. 

Outlook 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  Russian  government  maintained  a  pre- 
carious balance  between  the  newly  discovered  rights  of  citizens 
and  the  government's  perceived  need  for  security  from  domes- 
tic criticism  and  threats  to  its  power.  Between  1992  and  1996, 
the  record  of  the  Yeltsin  administration  was  decidedly  mixed. 
Reforms  gradually  appeared  in  prison  administration,  the 
rights  of  those  accused  of  crimes,  and  the  introduction  of  trial 
by  jury,  but  beginning  in  1993  legislation  and  executive  decrees 
increasingly  had  the  objective  of  strengthening  the  arbitrary 
powers  of  government  over  its  citizens  in  the  name  of  national 
security.  The  Procuracy  maintains  much  of  the  independence 
it  had  in  the  Soviet  period;  although  the  role  of  judges  and 
defense  attorneys  nominally  is  greater  in  the  post-Soviet  system, 
Russia  suffers  a  severe  shortage  of  individuals  experienced  in 
the  workings  of  a  Western-style  legal  system. 

The  national  security  establishment,  generally  smaller  and 
less  competent  than  the  pervasive  KGB  monolith  of  the  Soviet 
period,  has  undergone  reorganization  and  internal  power 
struggles  in  the  1990s,  and  in  some  instances  it  has  been  made 
the  scapegoat  for  setbacks  such  as  the  Chechnya  invasion. 
Agencies  such  as  the  regular  militia  (police)  and  the  Federal 
Border  Service  have  not  been  able  to  deal  effectively  with 
increased  crime,  smuggling,  and  illegal  immigration;  lack  of 
funding  is  an  important  reason  for  this  failure.  More  special- 
ized national  security  agencies  such  as  the  FSB  maintain  special 
investigative  prerogatives  beyond  the  purview  of  normal  law 
enforcement. 

As  average  Russian  citizens  have  gained  marginally  greater 
freedom  from  the  fear  of  arbitrary  government  intrusion,  they 
have  been  plagued  with  a  crime  wave  whose  intensity  has 
mounted  every  year  since  1991.  All  types  of  illegal  activity — 
common  street  theft,  drug-related  crime,  murder,  white-collar 
financial  crime,  and  extortion  by  organized  criminals — have 
flourished.  Although  the  government  has  announced  studies 
and  special  programs,  Russian  society  continues  to  present  an 
inviting  target  to  criminals  in  the  absence  of  effective  law 
enforcement  and  the  presence  of  rampant  corruption.

The  status  and  development  of  Russia's  internal  security 
agencies  and  crime  situation  are  described  in  numerous  peri- 
odical articles  and  a  few  substantive  monographs.  In  The  KGB: 
Police  and  Politics  in  the  Soviet  Union,  Amy  Knight  describes  the 
structure  and  influence  of  the  KGB  in  its  final  stage  before  the 
end  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  post-Soviet  position  of  internal 
security  agencies  is  described  by  J.  Michael  Waller  in  Secret 
Empire:  The  KGB  in  Russia  Today.  In  Comrade  Criminal:  Russia's 
New  Mafia,  Stephen  Handelman  investigates  Russia's  organized 
criminal  element  and  official  corruption,  against  the  backdrop 
of  social  conditions  and  government  attitudes  prevalent  in  the 
1990s.  The  1996  International  Narcotics  Control  Strategy  Report  of 
the  United  States  Department  of  State's  Bureau  of  Interna- 
tional Narcotics  Matters  provides  a  summary  of  narcotics  activ- 
ity and  government  prevention  measures  in  Russia.  Penny 
Morvant's  article  "War  on  Organized  Crime  and  Corruption" 
describes  Russia's  crime  wave  and  government  attempts  to 
combat  it;  two  articles  in  the  RFE/RL  Research  Report,  Christo- 
pher J.  Ulrich's  "The  Growth  of  Crime  in  Russia  and  the  Baltic 
Region"  and  Julia  Wishnevsky's  "Corruption  Allegations 
Undermine  Russia's  Leaders,"  approach  the  same  topics  from 
different  perspectives.  Numerous  articles  in  the  Christian  Sci- 
ence Monitor,  the  Foreign  Broadcast  Information  Service's  Daily 
Report:  Central  Eurasia,  and  the  Moscow  daily  newspapers  Neza- 
visimaya  gazeta  and  Izvestiya  include  current  information  on 
Russia's  criminal  justice  and  prison  systems  and  on  the  crime 
problem.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,  see

Glossary 


Academy  of  Sciences  (Akademiya  nauk) — Russia's  most  presti- 
gious scholarly  institute,  established  in  1725  by  Peter  the 
Great.  The  Academy  of  Sciences  has  historically  carried 
out  long-range  research  and  developed  new  technology. 
The  Academy  of  Sciences  of  the  Soviet  Union  conducted 
basic  research  in  the  physical,  natural,  mathematical,  and 
social  sciences.  In  1991  Russia  established  its  own  academy 
for  the  first  time  in  the  Soviet  era. 

Anti-Ballistic  Missile  Treaty  (ABM  Treaty) — A  1972  agreement 
limiting  deployment  of  United  States  and  Soviet  anti-ballis- 
tic missile  (ABM)  systems.  A  protocol  signed  in  1974  lim- 
ited each  party  to  a  single  ABM  system  deployment  area. 
In  1996  the  United  States  and  Russia  negotiated  to  modify 
the  terms  of  the  treaty  in  order  to  permit  testing  of  tech- 
nology against  non-intercontinental  delivery  systems. 

balance  of  payments — A  record  of  receipts  from  and  payments 
to  the  rest  of  the  world  by  a  country's  government  and  its 
residents.  The  balance  of  payments  includes  the  interna- 
tional financial  transactions  of  a  country  for  commodities, 
services,  capital  transactions,  and  gold  movements. 

balance  of  trade — A  record  of  a  country's  trade  in  goods  with 
the  rest  of  the  world.  The  balance  of  trade  differs  from  the 
balance  of  payments  (q.v.)  because  the  latter  includes 
transactions  for  services  and  the  former  does  not.  When 
the  exports  of  merchandise  exceed  imports,  a  country  is 
said  to  have  a  balance  of  trade  surplus  or  to  have  a  favor- 
able balance  of  trade.  When  the  imports  of  merchandise 
exceed  exports,  a  country  is  said  to  have  a  balance  of  trade 
deficit  or  to  have  an  unfavorable  balance  of  trade. 

Bank  for  International  Standards  (BIS) — Established  in  1930 
to  assist  national  central  banks  in  managing  and  investing 
monetary  reserves  and  to  promote  international  coopera- 
tion among  those  banks. 

Bolshevik — Originally  referring  to  a  member  of  the  majority 
(bol'shinstvo),  a  name  adopted  by  the  radical  members  of 
the  Russian  Social  Democratic  Labor  Party  in  1903.  In 
March  1918,  the  Bolsheviks  formed  the  Russian  Commu- 
nist Party  (Bolshevik) .  That  Party  was  the  precursor  of  the 
Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU — q.v.).

Russia:  A  Country  Study 

boyar — Between  the  tenth  and  seventeenth  centuries,  a  mem- 
ber of  the  upper  level  of  the  nobility  and  state  administra- 
tion in  Kievan  Rus1  and  Muscovy.  Abolished  as  a  class  by 
Peter  the  Great. 

Brezhnev  Doctrine — The  Soviet  Union's  declared  right  to 
intervene  in  the  internal  affairs  of  another  socialist  state  if 
the  leading  role  of  that  state's  communist  party  was  threat- 
ened. Formulated  as  justification  for  the  Soviet  Union's

see common  interests  of  its  members  in  economics,  for- 
eign policy,  and  defense  matters.  In  October  1993,

strengthen  CIS  authority  and  interaction  generally  have 
not  been  successful. 

communism/communist — A  doctrine  based  on  revolutionary 
Marxist  socialism  (q.v.)  and  Marxism-Leninism  (q.v.).  As

system  of  authoritarian  government  in  which  the  CPSU 
(q.v.)  alone  controlled  state-owned  means  of  production.

agreement  signed  in  November  1990  by  the  members  of 
the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — q.v.)  and 
the  Warsaw  Pact  (q.v.)  states.  The  CFE  Treaty  sets  ceilings 
from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Urals  on  armaments  essential  for 
conducting  a  surprise  attack  and  initiating  large-scale 
offensive  operations.  The  treaty  includes  a  strict  system  of

tium to  the  Slavic  people,  the  alphabet  is  used  in  Russia, 
Belarus,  Bulgaria,  Ukraine,  and  Yugoslavia.  The  Central

dumy  of  the  Kievan  Rus'  period  and  city  dumy  of  the  nine- 
teenth and  early  twentieth  centuries,  the  Duma  originally 
was  to  be  a  national  representative  body  with  the  power  to 
approve  legislation.  The  first  two  Dumy  (1905-07)  were 
quickly  dissolved  because  they  opposed  tsarist  policies;  the 
next  two  (1907-17)  were  more  conservative  and  served 
full  five-year  terms.

General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT) — An  inte- 
grated set  of  bilateral  trade  agreements  among  more  than 
100  contracting  nations.  Originally  drawn  up  in  1947  to 
abolish  quotas  and  reduce  tariffs  among  members.  The 
Soviet  Union  eschewed  joining  GATT  until  1987,  when  it

stabilizing  international  exchange  rates  and  payments.  Its 
main  function  is  to  provide  loans  to  its  members  (includ- 
ing industrialized  and  developing  countries)  when  they 
experience  balance  of  payments  (q.v.)  difficulties.  These 
loans  frequently  have  conditions  that  require  substantial

amendment  to  the  START  agreement  by  which  Russia, 
Ukraine,  Belarus,  and  Kazakstan  undertook  the  Soviet 
Union's  obligations  under  START  I. 

Marshall  Plan — A  plan  announced  in  June  1947  by  United 
States  secretary  of  state  George  Marshall  for  the  recon- 
struction of  Europe  after  World  War  II.  The  plan  was 
extended  to  all  European  countries,  but  the  Soviet  Union 
refused  the  offer  and  forbade  the  East  European  countries 
to  accept  aid  under  the  Marshall  Plan.  As  a  counterweight, 
the  Soviet  Union  created  the  Council  for  Mutual  Eco- 
nomic Assistance  (Comecon — q.v.).

1949,  NATO  served  as  the  primary  collective  defense  alli- 
ance in  the  containment  of  Soviet  expansionism.  Its  mili- 
tary and  administrative  structure  remain  intact.  The 
question  of  expanding  NATO  to  include  former  Warsaw 
Pact  (q.v.)  members  and  successor  states  to  the  Soviet 
Union  became  a  key  issue  in  Russian  foreign  policy  in  the 
mid-1990s.  In  1994  the  alliance  introduced  a  program  for 
the  former  Soviet  republics  and  the  former  Warsaw  Pact 
countries  called  Partnership  for  Peace  (q.v.). 

Nuclear  Nonpoliferation  Treaty  (NPT;  full  title  Treaty  on  the

Russian.  Used  in  liturgies  of  the  Slavic  Orthodox  churches. 
After  the  twelfth  century,  known  as  Church  Slavonic. 

Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development 
(OECD) — Founded  by  Western  nations  in  1961  to  stimu- 
late economic  progress  and  world  trade.  It  also  coordi-

Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE)  in  July  1972  by  Canada, 
the  United  States,  and  all  of  the  European  states  except 
Albania.  In  August  1975,  these  states  signed  the  Helsinki 
Accords,  confirming  existing,  post-World  War  II  bound- 
aries and  obligating  signatories  to  respect  basic  principles 
of  human  rights.  Subsequently  the  CSCE  held  sessions  and 
consultations  on  European  security  issues.  The  Charter  of 
Paris  (1990)  established  the  CSCE  as  a  permanent  organi- 
zation. In  1992  new  CSCE  roles  in  conflict  prevention  and 
management  were  defined,  potentially  making  the  CSCE 
the  center  of  a  Europe-based  collective  security  system — a 
role  advocated  by  Russia  in  the  mid-1990s.  The  CSCE 
became  the  OSCE  in  January  1995.  As  of  1996,  fifty-three 
nations  were  members. 

Partnership  for  Peace  (PfP) — An  initiative  by  NATO  (q.v.)  for 
the  former  Warsaw  Pact  (q.v.)  member  countries  and  the 
former  Soviet  republics,  including  Russia,  to  expand  polit- 
ical and  military  cooperation  and  promote  democratic 
principles  in  those  countries.  PfP  aims  to  facilitate  trans- 
parency in  defense  planning  and  budgeting,  ensure  demo- 
cratic control  of  defense  forces,  maintain  readiness  to 
contribute  to  United  Nations  and  OSCE  (q.v.)  operations, 
and  develop  cooperative  military  relations  with  NATO  for 
peacekeeping,  search-and-rescue,  and  humanitarian  oper- 
ations. All  former  Soviet  and  Warsaw  Pact  states  were  mem- 
bers by  1996,  and  many  had  conducted  joint  military 
exercises  with  NATO  forces. 

patriarch — Head  of  an  independent  Orthodox  Church,  such

1992  called  autonomous  republics),  including  the  war- 
torn  Republic  of  Chechnya. 

ruble — The  monetary  unit  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  Russian 
Federation;  divided  into  100  kopeks.  The  exchange  rate  as 
of  July  1997  was  5,790  rubles  per  US$1.  Historically,  the

became  convertible  on  the  international  market  in  June 
1996. 

ruble  zone — Name  given  the  group  of  newly  independent 
states  that  continued  to  use  the  Soviet,  then  Russian,  ruble 
as  the  primary  currency  for  financial  transactions  after  the 
collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  ruble  zone  existed  from 
December  1991  until  July  1993,  when  the  Russian  Central 
Bank  withdrew  all  ruble  notes  issued  before  January  1993. 

Russian  Empire — Successor  state  to  Muscovy.  Formally  pro- 
claimed by  Tsar  Peter  the  Great  in  1721  and  significantly 
expanded  during  the  reign  of  Catherine  II,  becoming  a 
major  multinational  state.  The  empire's  political  structure 
collapsed  with  the  revolution  of  February  1917,  but  most 
of  its  territory  was  included  in  the  Soviet  Union,  which  was 
established  in  1922.  *

republics  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Inhabited  predominantly  by 
Russians,  the  RSFSR  comprised  approximately  75  percent

population,  and  more  than  60  percent  of  its  economic  out- 
put.

pated by  Tsar  Alexander  II  in  1861. 

Slavophiles — Members  of  the  Russian  intelligentsia  in  the  mid- 
nineteenth  century  who  advocated  the  preservation  of 
Slavic,  and  specifically  Russian,  culture  rather  than  open- 
ing Russian  society  and  institutions  to  the  influences  of 
West  European  culture.  Philosophically  opposed  to  West- 
er nizers  (q.v.). 

socialism/socialist — According  to  Marxism-Leninism  (q.v.),  the 
first  phase  of  communism  (q.v.).  A  transition  from  capital- 
ism in  which  the  means  of  production  are  state  owned  and 
whose  guiding  principle  is  "from  each  according  to  his 
abilities,  to  each  according  to  his  work."  Soviet  socialism 
bore  scant  resemblance  to  the  democratic  socialism  that 
some  West  European  countries  adopted  in  the  twentieth 
century.

their  associated  launchers  and  warheads;  submarine- 
launched  ballistic  missile  launchers  and  warheads;  and 
heavy  bombers  and  their  armaments,  including  long-range 
nuclear  air-launched  cruise  missiles.  START  II,  signed  in 
January  1993  by  Russia  and  the  United  States  but  still 
unratified  by  Russia  in  mid-1997,  further  reduced  strategic 
offensive  arms  of  both  sides  by  eliminating  all  ICBMs  with 
multiple-warhead  independently  targeted  reentry  vehicles 
(MIRVs)  and  reducing  the  overall  total  of  warheads  for 
each  side  to  between  3,000  and  3,500.  In  1997  an  impor- 
tant part  of  Russia's  debate  over  future  military  and  for- 
eign policy.

(IDA),  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and 
the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA). 
The  IBRD,  established  in  1945,  has  the  primary  purpose  of 
providing  loans  to  developing  countries  for  productive 
projects.  The  IDA,  a  legally  separate  loan  fund  adminis- 
tered by  the  staff  of  the  IBRD,  was  set  up  in  1960  to  furnish 
credits  to  the  poorest  developing  countries  on  much  easier 
terms  than  those  of  conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC, 
founded  in  1956,  supplements  the  activities  of  the  IBRD 
through  loans  and  assistance  designed  specifically  to 
encourage  the  growth  of  productive  private  enterprises  in 
the  less  developed  countries.  The  president  and  certain 
senior  officers  of  the  IBRD  hold  the  same  positions  in  the 
IFC.  The  MIGA,  which  began  operating  in  June  1988, 
insures  private  foreign  investment  in  developing  countries 
against  such  noncommercial  risks  as  expropriation,  civil 
strife,  and  inconvertibility.  The  four  institutions  are  owned 
by  the  governments  of  the  countries  that  subscribe  their 
capital.  To  participate  in  the  World  Bank  group,  member 
states  must  first  belong  to  the  International  Monetary 
Fund  (IMF — q.v.). 

World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) — The  legal  and  institu- 
tional foundation  of  the  multilateral  trading  system  and 
successor  to  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade 
(GATT — q.v.)  as  of  January  1,  1995.  The  WTO  acts  as  a 
forum  for  multinational  trade  negotiations,  administers 
dispute  settlements,  reviews  the  trade  policies  of  member 
nations,  and  works  with  organizations  such  as  the  Interna- 
tional Monetary  Fund  {q.v.)  and  the  World  Bank  (q.v.)  in 
developing  coherent  global  economic  policies.  The  WTO 
also  covers  new  commercial  activities  beyond  the  jurisdic- 
tion of  GATT,  such  as  intellectual  property  rights,  services, 
and  investment.  Russia  sought  membership  in  1996,  but  it 
had  not  been  accepted  as  of  mid-1997. 

Yalta  Conference — Meeting  of  Josph  V.  Stalin,  Winston 
Churchill,  and  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  in  February  1945 
that  redrew  post-World  War  II  national  borders  and  estab- 
lished spheres  of  influence  in  Europe.
