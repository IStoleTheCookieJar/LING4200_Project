tudy  after  study  shows  that  the  sooner  a  child  begins  learning,  the  better  he  or  she  does  down  the 
road  ...  So  let's  do  what  works,  and  make  sure  none  of  our  children  start  the  race  of  life  already  behind. 
Let's  give  our  kids  that  chance.

A  CALL  TO  ACTION 


Libraries  and  museums  can  play  a 
stronger  role  in  early  learning  for  all 
children.  As  our  nation  commits  to 
early  learning  as  a  national  priority 
essential  to  our  economic  and  civic 
future,1  it  is  time  to  become  more 
intentional  about  deploying  these 
vital  community  resources  to  this 
challenge. 


Libraries  and  museums  are  trusted,  welcoming  places 
where  children  make  discoveries,  deepen  common 
interests,  expand  words  and  knowledge,  and  connect 
their  natural  curiosity  to  the  wider  world.  Neurosci¬ 
entists  tell  us  that  the  type  of  learning  that  occurs  in 
these  institutions — self-directed,  experiential,  content- 
rich — promotes  executive  function  skills  that  can  shape 
a  child’s  success  in  school  and  life.  The  experiences, 
resources,  and  interactions  provided  by  libraries  and 
museums  build  brains  and  fuel  a  love  of  learning. 


Parents  know  this  and  flock  to  museums  and  libraries 
not  only  to  support  their  child’s  learning  but  also  to 
bolster  their  important  role  as  their  child’s  first  teacher. 
The  Pew  Research  Center’s  recent  report,  Parents'  and 
Children's  Special  Relationship  with  Reading  and  Libraries , 


documents  that  an  overwhelming  percentage  of  parents 
of  young  children,  especially  those  with  annual  incomes 
under  $50,000,  believe  that  libraries  are  “very  impor¬ 
tant”  for  their  children,  and  are  eager  for  more  and 
varied  family  library  services.2 


We  have  to  work  to  ensure  that  more  children  and  par¬ 
ents,  especially  those  at  low  socioeconomic  levels,  can 
tap  into  the  learning  resources  of  libraries  and  muse¬ 
ums.  According  to  a  recent  IMLS  analysis,  only  36  per¬ 
cent  of  children  with  the  lowest  socioeconomic  status 
visited  libraries  in  their  kindergarten  year,  compared 
to  66  percent  of  children  in  the  highest;  for  museums, 
these  figures  are  43  percent  versus  65  percent.3  Recent 
research  points  out  that  the  disparity  of  access  to  learn¬ 
ing  resources  between  children  of  affluence  and  those 
in  poverty  has  created  a  knowledge  gap  with  serious 


implications  for  students’  economic 
prosperity  and  social  mobility.4 


These  data  underscore  the  urgency 
of  this  report.  Libraries — public 
and  school — and  museums  of  all 
types — art,  history,  and  children’s 
museums;  science  centers;  nature 
centers  and  gardens;  aquaria;  and 
zoos — form  an  extensive,  diverse 
infrastructure  of  informal  learning 
that  is  equipped  to  deliver  critical 
early  learning  resources  to  young 
children  and  families,  especially 
those  most  in  need.  Yet,  in  too  many 
communities,  museums  and  libraries 
are  not  “at  the  table”  helping  to  craft 
the  policies  and  practices  that  link 
children  and  their  families  to  early 
learning  resources. 


It  is  critical  to  act  now  to  incorporate,  and  leverage,  our 
well-established  informal  learning  system  as  an  essen¬ 
tial  component  of  our  nation’s  early  learning  network. 
It  is  a  wise  use  of  limited  resources,  both  funding  and 
human  capital,  that  will  help  our  nation  develop  the 
potential  of  every  child  and  result  in  a  stronger  econ¬ 
omy,  a  more  effective  workforce,  and  a  nation  of  learn¬ 
ers.  With  an  increased  focus  on  their  capacity,  these 
institutions  can  be  more  essential  early  learning  part¬ 
ners  at  the  community,  state,  and  national  levels. 


This  report  calls  upon  communities  to  engage  libraries 
and  museums  as  a  key  partner  in  comprehensive  early 
learning  strategies  to  grow  young  minds.  It  highlights 
the  exciting  work  these  institutions  are  doing  around 
the  country  in  partnership  with  communities  to  shape 
children’s  outcomes  in  school  and  in  life.  We  need  to 
do  more,  especially  for  those  low-income  children  who 
need  more.  If  we  can  strengthen  the  country’s  network 
of  museums  and  libraries  to  be  a  greater  force  for  early 
learning,  effective  learning  opportunities  for  all  chil¬ 
dren  can  deepen  and  grow. 


Libraries  and  museums  in  communities  across 
the  country  are  expanding  learning  opportunities 
that  prepare  our  youngest  children  for  a  lifetime 
of  learning  and  success.

AS  WE  WORK  TOGETHER  TO  MEET  EARLY  LEARNING  CHALLENGES,  OUR  NATION'S  1  23,000  LIBRARIES  AND 

1 7,500  museums  are: 

Community  anchors,  cornerstones  of  our  democracy,  that  provide  safe  and  accessible  civic  spaces 
promoting  lifelong  learning,  cultural  enrichment,  and  civic  engagement,  especially  for  underserved  and 
vulnerable  families  and  their  children. 

Connectors  that  bridge  the  generations  and  bring  children,  their  parents,  and  their  families  together  in  fun 
and  nonthreatening  settings  that  build  mutual  knowledge,  skills,  and  self-efficacy. 

Innovative  learning  specialists  that  create  "teachable  moments"  through  exhibits,  outreach  programs,  and 
environments  that  invite  hands-on  experiential  learning. 

Stewards  of  rich  cultural,  scientific,  environmental,  and  historical  heritages,  which  offer  robust  collections 
of  resources  appealing  to  all  disciplines  and  levels  of  learners. 

Digital  hubs  that  provide  guidance  for  navigating  new  technologies  and  identify  trusted  online  resources 
to  help  close  the  digital  divide  for  all  children,  their  parents,  and  caregivers. 


Growing  Young  Minds 


CHILDREN'S  EMOTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT  IS  BUILT  INTO  THE  ARCHITECTURE  OF  THEIR  BRAINS 

A  growing  body  of  scientific  evidence  demonstrates  that  emotional  development  begins  early  in  life  and 
is  closely  connected  with  the  emergence  of  cognitive,  language,  and  social  skills.  Early  emotional  develop¬ 
ment  lays  the  foundation  for  later  academic  performance,  mental  health,  and  the  capacity  to  form  suc¬ 
cessful  relationships.  Despite  this  knowledge,  most  policies  related  to  early  childhood  focus  exclusively  on 
cognitive  development  as  it  relates  to  school  readiness,  neglecting  the  importance  of  such  capacities  as 
the  ability  to  regulate  one's  own  emotions  and  behavior  and  to  manage  successful  interactions  with  other 
people.  A  report  from  the  National  Scientific  Council  on  the  Developing  Child  presents  an  overview  of  the 
scientific  research  on  how  a  child's  capacity  to  regulate  emotions  develops  in  a  complex  interaction  with  his 
or  her  environment  and  ongoing  cognitive,  motor,  and  social  development.  It  then  discusses  the  implica¬ 
tions  of  this  research  for  policies  affecting  young  children,  their  caregivers,  and  service  providers.

AMERICA'S  NEW  LEARNING 
LANDSCAPE 

Libraries  and  museums  have  a  long  history  of  serving 
young  children.  They  are  virtually  everywhere — from 
the  smallest  tribal  community  to  the  largest  metro¬ 
politan  area.  As  community  repositories  of  literature, 
science,  and  heritage,  museums  and  libraries  build  on 
how  children  learn  best,  by  designing  and  delivering 
content-rich,  play-based  experiences  that  link  early 
learning  best  practice  to  books,  exhibits,  and  collec¬ 
tions.  Their  resources  prompt  parents  and  caregivers 
to  explore,  pose  questions,  make  connections,  exchange 
information  and  ideas,  and  instill  in  young  children  not 
only  a  love  of  learning,  but  also  the  skills  for  learning. 
It  is  this  established  expertise  that  makes  museums  and 
libraries  such  valuable  assets  in  community-wide  efforts 
to  promote  early  learning.  The  emerging  learning  land¬ 
scape  makes  their  participation  imperative. 

This  new  landscape  redefines  where,  when,  and  how 
learning  occurs,  calling  for  innovative  environments 


where  skills  are  developed  across  domains  and  knowl¬ 
edge  is  transferred  from  one  situation  to  another,  ulti¬ 
mately  building  the  capacity  to  work  in  a  world  where 
“how  to  know”  is  as  important  as  “what  to  know.”  ' 

New  Skills  for  Learning 

Contributing  to  this  expanded  view  of  where,  when,  and 
how  learning  takes  place  is  a  growing  body  of  research 
that  draws  attention  to  an  important  set  of  foundation 
skills,  anchored  in  children’s  early  social-emotional 
development.  Known  as  executive  function,  these  skills 
are  key  to  a  child’s  earliest  brain  development,  building 
focus  and  self-control,  perspective  taking,  communica¬ 
tion,  and  making  connections.  In  the  process  of  devel¬ 
oping  these  executive  function  skills,  children  use  their 
social,  emotional,  and  cognitive  capacities  in  pursuit  of 
goals.  These  skills  are  the  “how”  of  learning,  enabling 
children  to  master  the  “what”  of  learning — reading, 
writing,  social  studies,  and  science,  technology,  engi¬ 
neering,  and  mathematics  (STEM)  concepts.  Taken 
together,  they  help  children  become  self-directed, 
engaged  learners.

ibraries  and  museums  can  tackle  barriers  to  reading  proficiency.  As  trusted  local  institutions, 
museums  and  libraries  have  the  convening  and  staying  power  to  help  communities  do  the  hard 
work  of  surfacing,  connecting,  linking,  and  replicating  best  practice  and  building  local  capacity.

Growing  Young  Minds 


A  Widening  Gap 

In  spite  of  our  growing  understanding  that  the  early 
years  are  pivotal  for  later  success  and  the  recognition 
that  important  foundational  skills  and  knowledge  must 
be  supported  and  nurtured  during  this  critical  period, 
too  many  children — especially  those  who  are  most  dis¬ 
advantaged  and  vulnerable — continue  to  fall  behind.  Too 
many  children  are  starting  school  without  the  language, 
cognitive,  social,  and  emotional  tools  needed  to  succeed, 
and  too  many  are  reaching  the  critical  third-grade  mark 
unable  to  meet  the  expectations  for  ongoing  success. 

Research  shows  that  children  who  start  behind  will 
stay  behind  and  in  many  cases  continue  to  lose  ground, 
making  it  more  likely  they  will  need  costly  remediation, 
be  retained,  or  even  drop  out  of  school.6 

These  conditions  disproportionately  impact  poor  and 
minority  children.  Children  who  are  poor — more  than 
one  out  of  five  American  children  (22  percent)  in  2010 
and  2011 — are  most  likely  to  live  in  single-mother 
homes  and  be  under  the  age  of  five.  The  result:  a  large 
and  growing  segment  of  young  children  are  grow¬ 
ing  up  in  under-resourced  environments  with  striking 
gaps  between  resources  and  supports  available  to  them 
as  opposed  to  their  more  affluent  peers.  The  stark  dis¬ 
parities  in  both  human  and  material  resources  between 
poor  and  more  affluent  populations  has  resulted  in  what 
Susan  Neuman  and  Donna  Celano,  Giving  Our  Chil¬ 
dren  a  Fighting  Chance  (2012),  call  a  “knowledge  gap”  and 
what  David  Brooks,  ( New  York  Times ,  2012)  and  others 
are  calling  an  “opportunity  gap.”8  By  whatever  name, 
it  is  an  issue  that  must  be  addressed,  and  museums  and 
libraries  should  be  part  of  the  solution.

SAME  CITY,  WORLDS  APART 


In  their  10-year  analysis  of  conditions  impacting  learning  and  literacy  development  in  two  Philadelphia 
neighborhoods,  Neuman  and  Celano  (2012)  identified  enormous  disparities  in  resources  and  opportunities 
between  a  poor  community  and  an  affluent  community,  including: 

°  Children  who  have  early  access  to  print  and  technology  continue  to  build  and  gain  knowledge.  Children 
who  don't  have  early  access  enter  school  far  behind  and  are  taught  the  "basics." 

°  Children  who  read  a  lot  know  a  lot.  Those  who  don't  read  as  much  lack  reading  speed  and  comprehen¬ 
sion,  reducing  knowledge  acquisition. 

°  Children  with  easy  and  regular  access  to  computers  are  comfortable  using  search  engines,  filtering  and 
comparing  information  sources,  and  using  computers  to  support  learning.  Children  without  such  access 
are  unfamiliar  with  how  to  navigate  and  make  decisions  about  the  quality  of  information. 


The  Challenge 

The  challenge  now  for  educators,  families,  policy 
makers,  civic  leaders,  community-based  institutions, 
and  grant  makers  is  to  work  together  to  find  solutions. 
How  can  we  create  a  coordinated  set  of  services  and  sup¬ 
ports  that  intentionally  uses  all  learning  entry  points 
to  effectively  move  children — especially  those  most  at 
risk — successfully  through  the  education  continuum? 

Efforts  to  find  solutions  and  implement  strategies  are 
taking  place  at  every  level  of  educational  leadership  and 
policy  development.  At  the  federal  and  state  levels,  new 
policies  are  being  implemented  to  support  children’s 
early  learning  success  through  broad-based  systems- 
building  efforts  and,  in  communities,  these  policies  are 
being  put  into  practice. 


Research  provides  strong  evidence  of  the  critical  impor¬ 
tance  of  community-  or  place-based  efforts  in  support¬ 
ing  children’s  growth  and  development,  especially  in 
the  earliest  learning  years.9  Local  conditions  can  have 
a  major  impact  on  whether  children  succeed,  and  chal¬ 
lenges  must  be  addressed  within  the  context  of  the 
community  to  assure  effective  solutions  are  reached. 
To  that  end,  communities  across  the  nation  are  coming 
together  to  develop  plans  to  address  problems  and  put 
policy  strategies  into  action. 

At  the  heart  of  these  efforts  is  an  understanding  that  real 
change  will  only  be  accomplished  through  broad-based, 
multi-sector  collaboration.  Libraries  and  museums 
are  well-positioned  to  be  integral  parts  of  coordinated 
efforts,  but  are  too  often  untapped  or  disconnected 
resources  in  community  efforts  to  support  more  posi¬ 
tive  outcomes  for  families  and  children.

Museums  and  Libraries — 

Essential  Community  and  Education  Partners 

Librarians  and  museum  professionals  are  important  facil¬ 
itators  of  learning,  working  with  families  and  caregivers 
and  transforming  visits  to  museums  and  libraries  into 
“teachable  moments”  that  connect  children’s  experience 
to  deeper  learning  and  knowledge.  They  are  anchoring 
practices  in  research  and  partnering  with  other  commu¬ 
nity  service  providers  to  provide  generation-spanning, 
high-quality,  informal  learning  opportunities.  They  are 
creating  environments,  programs,  and  experiences  that 
expand  and  deepen  the  abilities  of  our  youngest  learn¬ 
ers,  their  families,  and  caregivers.  In  turn,  communi¬ 
ties  are  beginning  to  recognize  museums  and  libraries 
as  key  components  of  their  early  learning  infrastruc¬ 
ture,  and  school  leaders  are  recognizing  that  engaging 
museums  and  libraries,  including  school  librarians,  can 
improve  children’s  outcomes  in  school. 


PUBLIC  LIBRARIES  SURVEY  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES!  CHILDREN'S  PROGRAMS  AND  COLLECTIONS 

In  the  most  recent  national  survey  (2010),  public  libraries  offered  3.75  million  programs  to  the  public.  The 
majority  of  these  programs  (61.5  percent  or  2.31  million)  are  designed  for  children  aged  11  and  younger. 
Attendance  at  programs  increased  21.9  percent  since  FY  2005. 

o  Public  libraries'  circulation  continues  to  increase  with  2.46  billion  materials  circulated  in  FY  2010,  the 
highest  circulation  in  10  years.  Circulation  of  children's  materials  has  increased  by  28.3  percent  in  the  last 
1 0  years  and  comprises  over  one-third  of  all  materials  circulated  in  public  libraries.10 


There  are  ten  key  ways  in  which  museums  and  libraries  are  currently 
supporting  communities' efforts  to  develop  a  strong  start  for  young 
children's  learning.  Each  way  works  to  leverage  the  unique  assets 
that  libraries  and  museums  offer  to  nurture  the  passion  and  skills  for

INCREASING  HIGH-QUALITY  EARLY 
LEARNING  EXPERIENCES 


Libraries  and  museums  provide  easily  accessible,  high-quality  early  learning  experiences  to  families  and  those 
who  care  for  children  outside  the  home.  These  institutions  support  the  quality  improvement  efforts  of  many 
early  learning  programs;  yet  they  play  a  particularly  critical  role  for  parents  and  providers  caring  for  children  in 
home-based  programs,  often  called  family,  friend,  and  neighbor  care.  For  many  poor  and  vulnerable  children, 
libraries  and  museums  function  as  community  “touch  points,”  providing  engaging  pathways  into  knowledge-  and 
skill-building.

Every  Child  Ready  to  Read  (ECRR),  developed  by  the  Public  Library  Association 
and  the  Association  for  Library  Service  to  Children,  is  a  research-based  training 
model  for  parents  and  caregivers  that  supports  early  literacy  development 
in  children  from  birth  to  five.  Grounded  in  six  early  literacy  skills,  the  training 
uses  basic,  user-friendly  activities  to  guide  caregivers'  and  parents'  abilities  to 
understand  and  support  early  literacy  development.  The  program  has  been 
successfully  implemented  by  libraries  across  the  country  and  is  being  enhanced 
with  interactive  online  content  for  home  use.

families  in  remote  areas  of  Alaska.  The  Minnesota  Children's  Museum  partnered 
with  the  St.  Paul  Public  Library  system  to  install  children's  exhibits  in  two 
underserved  libraries  to  assure  that  families  and  those  caring  for  children  in  family, 
friend,  and  neighbor  care  settings  have  local  access  to  literacy-based  interactive 
experiences.  The  California  Science  Center  in  Los  Angeles  has  created  Discovery

ENGAGING  AND  SUPPORTING  FAMILIES 
AS  THEIR  CHILD'S  FIRST  TEACHERS 


As  trusted  community  anchors,  museums  and  libraries  are  natural  and  safe  places  for  families  to  go  to  learn 
together  and  access  important  resources.  For  families  who  do  not  have  other  links  to  community  information, 
museums  and  libraries  are  places — and  in  some  communities,  the  only  places — where  they  can  borrow  books, 
learning  backpacks,  and  other  materials  for  home  use;  learn  firsthand  how  to  actively  engage  in  age-appropriate 
ways  with  their  children;  or  locate  high-quality  child  and  health  care  providers  and  other  local  services.

Family  Place  Libraries™,  originating  in  New  York's  Middle  Country  Public  Library, 
uses  an  asset-based  approach  to  address  the  needs  of  families  and  caregivers  with 
very  young  children.  Research-based,  Family  Place  focuses  on  the  whole  child  and 
the  role  of  parents  as  first  teachers.  As  centers  for  early  childhood  information,  parent 
education,  early  literacy,  socialization,  and  family  support,  these  full-service  libraries 
serve  as  community  destinations  for  families  and  caregivers.  The  Family  Place  model 
has  been  replicated  in  over  375  libraries  in  26  states  and  continues  to  expand. 

The  Dallas  Museum  of  Art's  mascot,  Arturo  the  parrot,  and  his  giant  nest,  welcomes 
young  children  and  their  families  to  the  museum  and  its  collections,  with  on-site 
story  times,  tours,  art  classes,  and  parent  and  family  workshops  and  a  rich  collection 
of  online  resources.  In  partnership  with  four  school  districts  and  the  National  Council 
of  Jewish  Women,  the  museum  hosts  parents  and  preschoolers  participating  in  the

PARENTS  AND  CHILDREN'S  SPECIAL  RELATIONSHIP  WITH  READING  AND  LIBRARIES,  PEW  RESEARCH  CENTER 

Parents  have  a  special  relationship  with  libraries;  84  percent  of  parents  with  a  child  5  years  or  younger  say 
libraries  are  "very  important."  Most  parents  (86  percent)  say  libraries  should  coordinate  more  closely  with 
schools  to  offer  resources  for  children  and  offer  free  early  literacy  programs  to  help  young  children  prepare 
for  school. 

Major  reasons  libraries  are  important  to  parents  of  children  under  6  years: 

°  86  percent  say  libraries  help  develop  a  love  of  reading  and  books; 

81  percent  say  libraries  provide  access  to  information  and  resources  not  available  at  home;  and 
°  71  percent  say  libraries  are  a  safe  place  for  children. 

For  parents  earning  less  than  $50,000  per  year,  libraries  play  an  especially  important  role.  In  addition  to  the 
reasons  above,  a  larger  percentage  of  these  parents  cite  the  role  of  the  librarian  to  help  find  information, 
free  access  to  the  Internet,  quiet  study  spaces,  broader  selections  of  e-books,  and  more  interactive  learning 
experiences'1

SUPPORTING  DEVELOPMENT  OF  EXECUTIVE  FUNCTION  AND  "DEEPER 
LEARNING"  SKILLS  THROUGH  LITERACY  AND  STEM-BASED  EXPERIENCES 


Museums  and  libraries  help  lay  the  foundations  for  later  learning  and  academic  and  career  success,  including  basic 
literacy,  reading,  and  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  (STEM).  They  are  adept  “brain  builders,” 
offering  learning  environments  that  address  the  important  social,  emotional,  and  cognitive  aspects  of  learning  that 
include  persistence,  self-direction,  critical  thinking,  and  problem  solving.  Through  these  skills,  children  learn  to 
communicate  effectively  with  others,  improve  reading  comprehension,  and  apply  what  they  know  to  new  situations.

investigations  and  problem-based  activities  where  children  share  what  they  have 
made  through  storytelling,  a  technique  that  solidifies  scientific  concepts  and 
promotes  the  development  of  literacy  and  communication  skills. 

The  Yew  Dell  Botanical  Gardens  in  Crestwood,  Kentucky,  offers  nature  and 
garden  backpacks  containing  bug  catchers,  magnifiers,  nature  guides,  and  sketch 
books;  "Books  and  Blankets"  baskets  that  include  children's  books  and  blankets 
for  families  to  read  with  children  in  the  gardens;  and  scavenger  hunts  to  develop 
vocabulary  and  problem-solving  skills.

increased  student  proficiency  in  reading  and  language  arts.  Key  to  its  success 
has  been  the  school's  partnership  with  seven  local  museums.  Each  unit  of  study 
involves  children  in  a  nine-week  inquiry  in  which  they  ask  questions,  pursue 
answers  through  direct  experience,  and  share  what  they  learn  through  the 
creation  of  museum-quality  exhibits.

POSITIONING  CHILDREN  FOR  MEETING  EXPECTATIONS  OF  THE 
COMMON  CORE  STATE  STANDARDS 


Museums  and  libraries  are  stewards  of  cultural,  scientific,  historical,  and  environmental  heritage,  offering  rich  col¬ 
lections  of  books  and  objects  that  span  all  disciplines  and  knowledge  levels.  They  offer  exhibits,  environments,  and 
programs  that  foster  the  interest-driven  and  project-based  learning  that  is  emphasized  in  the  new  K-12  Common 
Core  State  Standards  for  Literacy  and  Math  and  the  Next  Generation  Science  Standards.  Museum  and  library 
staffs  are  experienced  in  the  inquiry-based  pedagogy  that  the  standards  demand  and  serve  as  “knowledge  naviga¬ 
tors”  who  can  support  teachers  in  meeting  these  new  learning  benchmarks.  School  librarians  play  a  particularly 
significant  role.  They  can  identify  valuable  resources  for  fellow  educators,  co-teach  lessons,  and  help  design  proj¬ 
ect-based  learning  experiences.

The  Nashville  Public  Library's  Limitless  Libraries  program  works  with  all 
elementary  school  students  in  the  city.  The  program  builds  strong  multilingual, 
multi-format  collections;  "curated"  digital  collections  for  young  children;  and 
resources  for  school  librarians  and  teachers  through  cross-format  literacy 
supplemental  kits  that  focus  on  common  nonfiction  themes  that  support  the 
Common  Core  curriculum. 

At  The  Henry  Ford  in  Dearborn,  Michigan,  the  "Be  an  Innovator  Like. .  .Henry 
Ford  or. .  .Rosa  Parks"  activity  book  series  (and  related  web-based  Innovation  101 
resources)  combines  history,  STEM,  and  literacy.  Using  visual  thinking  strategies 
(VTS),  mapping,  vocabulary-building,  spelling,  comprehension,  and  creative 
writing,  young  children  are  encouraged  to  think  critically  across  these  disciplines. 
With  the  successful  completion  of  a  pilot  phase,  the  program  is  now  expanding 
its  national  reach.

teachers  receive  a  book  based  on  the  civil  rights  movement  and  its  leaders,  a 
corresponding  syllabus  that  includes  project-based  activities,  and  a  bibliography 
of  related  texts  to  build  content  knowledge  and  disciplinary  literacy. 


ADDRESSING  THE  SUMMER  SLIDE 


Libraries  and  museums  are  important  partners  in  efforts  to  help  children  sustain  learning  during  the  summer 
months  when  too  many  children  are  losing  ground  as  a  result  of  not  having  access  to  resources.14  Visitation  at 
museums  increases  over  the  summer  months,  and  many  offer  special  programs  for  children  that  continue  content 
and  skill  learning  and  provide  motivation  to  read.  School  and  public  libraries  help  assure  that  children  have  access 
to  materials  they  need  to  maintain  and  even  advance  their  reading  skills  over  the  summer  months.  Public  libraries 
have  long  been  anchors  for  community-wide  activities  to  address  summer  reading  loss.  Today’s  efforts  are  tailored 
to  school  expectations,  standards,  and  student  progress,  with  strong  evaluation  components.  School  libraries  work 
with  local  public  libraries  to  promote  summer  reading  and  implement  a  number  of  school-based  efforts.  Library/ 
museum  innovations  include  creating  “pop-up”  libraries  in  places  such  as  farmers’  markets  and  shopping  centers; 
offering  summer  museum  programs  that  align  with  school  curricula;  and  providing  focused  individualized  tutor¬ 
ing  in  neighborhood  libraries.

The  Collaborative  Summer  Library  Program  is  a  consortium  of  all  50  states,  the 
District  of  Columbia,  and  the  territories,  working  together  to  provide  high-quality 
summer  reading  materials  for  children  at  the  lowest  cost  to  libraries.  By  selecting 
a  common  theme  each  year,  participating  libraries  leverage  resources  while 
planning  programs  that  address  the  needs  of  their  local  patrons. 

The  Southern  Pines,  North  Carolina,  Public  Library  is  a  core  partner  in  an 
intensive  program  run  by  the  school  system,  local  Boys  and  Girls  clubs,  and  a 
local  neighborhood  revitalization  group.  The  school  system  identifies  youth 
participants  for  the  six-week,  full-day  program  at  the  local  Boys  and  Girls  Club. 
Morning  activities  are  academically  focused,  while  the  afternoon  includes 
experiential  activities. 

The  Franklin  Institute  partners  with  the  Free  Library  of  Philadelphia  and 

educators  in  multiple  informal  settings  to  deliver  "LEAP  into  Science,"  a  project 
that  integrates  hands-on  science  learning  and  early  literacy.  Workshops  for 
children  in  grades  preK-5  and  caregivers  include  book  selections  and  hands-on 
activities  explicitly  linked  to  content  and  strategies  for  engaging  children  in 
science  and  literacy.  "LEAP  into  Science"  is  now  being  piloted  nationally  at  11  sites, 
including  27  partnering  organizations  nationwide.

LINKING  NEW  DIGITAL  TECHNOLOGIES  TO  LEARNING 


With  their  free  public  access  to  the  Internet,  libraries  are  important  community  digital  hubs,  with  expertise  in 
promoting  digital,  media,  and  information  literacy.  Museums  and  school  and  public  libraries  are  rich  sources 
of  accessible  digital  media,  educational  apps,  videos,  and  audio-  and  e-books,  with  staff  trained  to  help  parents 
and  youth  select  age-appropriate,  content-based,  curriculum-linked  materials.  They  help  close  the  digital  divide 
for  children,  families,  and  caregivers  who  lack  alternate  sources  of  access.  The  growth  of  digital  resource  use  in 
schools,  aligned  with  the  Common  Core  State  Standards  for  Literacy  and  Math,  points  to  an  enhanced  role  for 
school  librarians.  They  can  help  classroom  teachers  integrate  technology  into  their  course  design  and  work  with 
students  to  hone  their  digital  and  media  literacy  competencies,  thus  building  new  digital  citizens.

IMPROVING  FAMILY  HEALTH  AND  NUTRITION 


Children’s  learning  is  inextricably  linked  to  their  health,  with  research  demonstrating  that  health  disparities  for 
low-income  families  directly  impact  development  and  school  performance.1'  Museums  and  libraries  help  ensure 
that  all  families  have  access  to  needed  health  information  and  resources.  Many  offer  developmental  screenings  and 
vaccination  programs  that  can  impact  such  school-related  issues  as  chronic  absence;  as  well  as  advice  and  programs 
on  nutrition,  exercise,  and  gardening;  and  healthy  activities  for  family  members  of  all  ages.

The  Association  of  Children's  Museums'  Good  to  Grow ®  initiative  provides  a 
framework  for  museums  to  provide  healthy  choices  and  activities  for  children  and 
families.  The  Association's  "Going  Wild  in  Children's  Museums"  program  has  sup¬ 
ported,  in  partnership  with  the  National  Wildlife  Federation,  pilot  sites  that  create 
outdoor  spaces  to  connect  children  and  families  to  natural  outdoor  settings.  The 
sites  include  a  Driftwood  Fort  on  Puget  Sound  (Hands  On  Children's  Museum, 
Olympia,  Washington)  and  stream  tables  and  water  play,  berm  tunnels,  a  mon¬ 
arch  watch  site,  and  a  native  medicinal  plants  garden  in  Topeka  (Kansas  Children's 
Discovery  Center). 

Through  the  Let's  Move!  Museums  &  Gardens  initiative,  more  than  600  museums 
and  gardens  across  the  country  are  contributing  to  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama's 
Let's  Move!  campaign  to  combat  childhood  obesity.  The  Institute  of  Museum  and 
Library  Services  has  joined  forces  with  seven  national  museum  associations  in 
support  of  the  initiative.  Participating  museums  and  gardens  work  to  offer  exhib¬ 
its,  programs,  and  visitor  services  that  promote  healthy  habits,  nutritious  eating, 
and  physical  activity.  In  addition  to  its  heirloom  vegetable  garden  and  related 
workshops,  Old  World  Wisconsin— a  Wisconsin  historic  site  in  Eagle— offers 
many  opportunities  for  improving  health  through  physical  exercise.  Activities 
include  the  "Bustle-Hustle"  5K,  children's  games,  Eagle  Diamond  vintage  baseball, 
and  barn  dances.

Libraries  and  museums  have  long  recognized  the  importance  of  establishing  cross-sector  partnerships  to  map  and 
address  gaps  in  early  learning  service  provision  and  programs.  They  have  worked  with  schools  and  extended  day 
and  early  learning  programs,  including  co-locating  Head  Start  centers  in  many  museums  and  libraries.  They  also 
partner  with  family  health  centers  and  home  visiting  programs,  as  well  as  public  housing  authorities,  municipal 
governments,  corporations,  universities,  and  local  public  broadcasting  stations.

ADDING  CAPACITY  TO  EARLY  LEARNING  NETWORKS 


State  library  administrative  agencies  and,  in  many  states,  museum  associations  can  help  link  libraries  and  museums 
with  state-based  policies  and  programs.  They  stand  ready  to  participate  actively  as  a  growing  number  of  states 
build  shared,  seamless,  outcomes-based  systems  of  care,  services,  education,  and  family  supports  for  young  chil¬ 
dren.  Taking  the  lead  from  federal  initiatives,  these  efforts  include  both  policy  and  practice  that  promote  compre¬

Governor,  and  a  number  of  other  state  leaders  on  a  bus  tour  designed  to  collect 
community  input  on  the  state  of  early  literacy  in  Colorado.  This  statewide  tour 
launched  the  Colorado  Reads:  Early  Literacy  Initiative  that  continues  to  guide  state 
policy  to  boost  early  literacy  efforts  throughout  the  state.

Libraries  and  museums  stand 
ready  to  participate  actively  as  a 
growing  number  of  states  build 
shared,  seamless,  outcomes-based 
syste?ns  of  care,  services , 
education,  and  family  supports 
for  young  children. 


The  Arlington,  Texas,  Public  Library  is  leading  a  planning  effort  to  create  a 
more  coordinated  approach  to  school  readiness.  The  library  is  bringing  together 
leaders  from  the  school  districts,  United  Way,  Head  Start,  and  other  organizations 
to  address  low  readiness  scores  and  fragmented  services.  Using  the  National 
Neighborhood  Indicators  Partnership  (NNIP)  model,  they  are  analyzing  neighbor¬ 
hood  data  to  fill  gaps  in  services  and  programs.

MORE  TO  BE  DONE: 

TOWARD  AN  AGENDA  FOR 
FURTHER  RESEARCH 

Although  this  report  references  a  number  of  completed 
and  ongoing  research  and  evaluation  studies  about  the 
scope  and  impact  of  libraries  and  museums  on  the  devel¬ 
opment  of  young  children,  there  is  still  much  we  do  not 
know.  Here  are  some  questions  for  further  study: 

What  effect  do  libraries  and  museums  exert  on  the 
developing  child?  Is  the  effect  more  pronounced  for 
certain  domains  of  development? 

How  long  lasting  is  the  effect  of  an  isolated  visit  to 
a  library  or  museum?  What  is  the  effect  of  multiple 
visits,  whether  clustered  or  spread  out  over  time? 

What  is  the  relationship  between  what  children 
experience  when  they  visit  libraries  and  museums 
and  their  access  to  resources  in  their  home  and  early 
care  environment? 

Which  programs  offered  by  libraries  and  museums 
to  their  youngest  patrons  work  to  support  school 
readiness  and  to  improve  learning  outcomes?  In 
particular,  what  programs  work  for  children  who  are 
at  risk? 

How  often  do  children  need  to  visit  libraries  and 
museums  to  benefit  from  the  programs  and  resources 
offered  by  these  environments?  Is  there  a  critical 
window  during  the  early  years  in  which  earlier  or 
repeated  exposure  that  is  associated  with  improved 
outcomes? 


What  are  the  effects — short-  and  long-term — of 
library  and  museum  visitation  at  a  young  age  on  the 
development  of  skills  that  children  need  to  succeed 
in  school  and  beyond? 

Is  there  an  age  at  which  it  is  critical  that  children  gain 
exposure  to  the  kinds  of  programs,  resources,  and 
experiences  that  are  found  in  libraries  and  museums? 

RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  ACTION 

Today,  leaders  from  every  sector  of  our  society  recognize 
that  early  learning  is  critical  to  our  civic  and  economic 
future.  Our  country  must  strategically  use  its  existing  re¬ 
sources  wisely  in  a  collective  effort  to  close  knowledge 
and  opportunity  gaps  and  give  all  children  a  strong  start 
in  learning. 

As  dais  report  illustrates,  libraries  and  museums  are  up 
to  the  task.  They  have  used  their  roles  as  trusted  com¬ 
munity  anchors,  family  learning  centers,  innovative 
learning  specialists,  cultural  stewards,  and  digital  hubs 
to  support  and  expand  early  learning  opportunities.  In 
communities  across  the  country,  museums  and  libraries 
provide  safe,  accessible  learning  spaces;  engage  parents 
and  caregivers;  and  create  fun  and  enriching  program¬ 
ming  for  children  to  be  ready  for  school,  college,  and 
career. 

It  is  time  now  to  tap  their  enormous  potential  as  key 
contributors  to  federal,  state,  and  community  efforts  to 
improve  early  learning  outcomes,  increase  school  readi¬ 
ness,  and  ensure  that  all  children  are  reading  and  suc¬ 
ceeding  at  grade  three  and  beyond.

to  increase  family  engagement  in  school  readiness 
and  transition  to  kindergarten. 

Leverage  community  resources  and  services  to  make 
it  possible  for  underserved,  vulnerable  families  and 
children  to  access  libraries  and  museums  (e.g.,  trans¬ 
portation,  reduced-fee  structures). 

Use  library  and  museum  facilities  as  community 
gathering  places  and  digital  learning  hubs. 

Launch  public  information  campaigns  that  raise 
awareness  of  the  roles  museums  and  libraries  play  in 
supporting  early  learning. 


Districts,  schools,  and  early  learning  programs  can:

standing  of  standards,  curricula,  and  instructional 
practices  in  schools  and  the  available  resources  at 
museums  and  libraries. 

Establish  partnerships  with  local  libraries  and  muse¬ 
ums  to  provide  programs  and  services  that  support 
new  expectations  for  building  content  knowledge. 

Fully  engage  school  librarians  as  important  learning 
and  literacy  resources. 

Consider  leveraging  family  engagement  expertise 
and  programs  in  museums  and  libraries  to  supple¬ 
ment  school-based  efforts,  including  involving 
families  in  supporting  their  children’s  transition  to 
kindergarten. 

Museums  and  libraries  can: 

Establish  strong  partnerships  with  a  wide  range  of 
community  organizations. 

Provide  parental  and  family  support  and  access  to 
quality  programs  and  services,  especially  for  vulner¬ 
able  populations. 

Create  links  to  schools  that  support  local  education 
priorities  and  policies,  including  Common  Core  and 
other  state  standards. 

Incorporate  recent  research  on  the  brain,  executive 
function,  and  learning  into  exhibits  and  programs. 

Embed  rigorous  evaluation  into  program  develop¬ 
ment  and  base  programs  on  research  and  evidence. 


Parents,  grandparents,  and  caregivers  can: 

Visit  libraries  and  museums  with  their  children  to 
participate  in  activities  that  support  child  develop¬ 
ment  and  learning. 

Speak  up  to  staff  about  the  programs  and  services  they 
would  like  to  see  in  their  local  library  and  museum. 

Find  out  whether  their  local  museum  or  library  has 
resources  that  can  help  with  their  child’s  transition  to 
kindergarten,  homework,  or  health  and  nutrition  needs. 

Funders  can: 

Endorse  public-private  partnerships  to  advance  the 
role  of  museums  and  libraries  in  early  learning. 

Develop  grant  initiatives  to  support  innovative  part¬ 
nerships  among  libraries,  museums,  and  other  com¬ 
munity  organizations. 

Support  research  about  the  impact  of  libraries  and 
museums  on  the  development  of  young  children. 

To  create  a  vibrant,  engaging  environment  for  our 
next  generation  of  learners,  especially  for  those 
young  children  most  at  risk,  we  will  all  need  to: 

Recognize  the  important  resources  that  museums 
and  libraries  can  bring  to  advance  an  early  learning 
agenda  at  the  federal,  state,  and  community  levels. 

Pledge  to  include  museums  and  libraries  in  new 
efforts  to  create  strong  and  sustainable  systems  of 
early  learning. 

Develop  strategies  that  intentionally  link  the  infor¬ 
mal  resources  and  services  of  museums  and  libraries 
to  current  early  learning  policies  and  priorities. 


LIBRARIES  AND  MUSEUMS  AS  KEY  PARTNERS 
IN  COMMUNITY  EARLY  LEARNING  EFFORTS 


The  following  profiles  represent  current  work  in 
museums  and  libraries  to  address  our  children 's  early  learning  needs. 


CHILDREN'S  MUSEUM  OF  MANHATTAN: 
PLACE-BASED  SOLUTIONS  TO 
NATIONAL  ISSUES 

The  Children’s  Museum  of  Manhattan  (CMOM) 
has  developed  a  comprehensive  model  of  community 
engagement  that  educates  children  and  families  by  com¬ 
bining  the  arts,  literacy,  health,  math,  and  early  child¬ 
hood  education.  Literacy  is  a  central  component  in  each 
program.  CMOM  connects  government  agencies  and 
community-based  efforts  to  leverage  existing  networks 
and  align  resources  within  individual  neighborhoods  to 
support  low-income  children  and  families. 

CMOM’s  model  of  community  engagement  is  exempli¬ 
fied  by  the  EatPlayGrow™  Health  Initiative.  Launched 
in  2009,  in  cooperation  with  the  National  Institutes  of 
Health  (NIH)  and  a  national  advisory  board  of  pedi¬ 
atric  and  health  experts,  researchers,  and  community 
partners,  EatPlayGrow™  is  an  11-lesson  curriculum 
adapted  from  NIH’s  We  Can  obesity  prevention  pro¬ 
gram,  and  is  designed  specifically  for  children  aged  6  and 
younger  and  their  adult  caregivers.  Combining  NIH 
science  and  research  with  CMOM’s  arts  and  literacy- 
based  pedagogy,  the  curriculum  is  being  implemented 
in  both  informal  and  formal  learning  environments 
where  it  provides: 


Parent  and  child  engagement  programs  for  low- 
income  families  (tested  and  evaluated  at  community 
centers  in  the  South  Bronx  and  New  Orleans); 

Professional  development  for  adults  who  work  with 
young  children  from  low-income  families  (piloted  in 
Head  Start  with  at-home  care  providers  at  CMOM); 

EatPlayGrow™  Building  Health  Every  Day!  inter¬ 
active  health  exhibit  at  CMOM  and  accompanying 
programming;  and 

Exhibit  replication  plans  for  small  museums,  librar¬ 
ies,  and  community  centers. 

CMOM  works  to  deepen  community  engagement  and 
enhance  the  impact  of  the  EatPlayGrow™  curriculum 
in  the  community  by  building  a  network  of  commu¬ 
nity-based  organizations  and  city  agencies  to  expand 
health  education  to  high-need  communities.  Commu¬ 
nity  partners  include:  Community  Health  Care  Asso¬ 
ciation  of  NYC,  United  Way  of  NYC,  Administration 
for  Children’s  Services,  Head  Start,  City  University  of 
New  York’s  Professional  Development  Institute,  School 
of  Public  Health  at  Hunter  College,  Lincoln  Center 
Atrium,  Department  of  Health  and  Mental  Hygiene’s 
Nurse  Family  Partnership  and  Women-Infants-Children 
Program,  and  the  New  York  City  Housing  Authority. 


Growing  Young  Minds 


In  2009,  CMOM  conducted  a  series  of  third-party  pilot 
evaluations  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  EatPlayGrow™ 
curriculum  on  participants’  health  knowledge,  attitudes, 
and  behaviors.  Findings  emphasized  the  importance  of 
working  with  children  at  a  young  age.  Across  informal 
and  formal  settings,  and  with  demographically  diverse 
low-income  audiences,  participants  indicated  changes 
to  their  purchasing  preferences  and  food  habits,  and 
showed  positive  shifts  in  attitudinal  and  behavioral 
changes  about  food,  physical  activity,  and  sleep. 

In  the  coming  years,  CMOM  will  continue  to  rep¬ 
licate  and  disseminate  the  curriculum  and  conduct 


professional  development  trainings;  establish  a  partner¬ 
ship  with  the  City  University  of  New  York’s  School  of 
Public  Health  at  Hunter  College  to  evaluate  the  Eat¬ 
PlayGrow™  exhibit;  and  work  with  the  New  York  City 
Housing  Authority  to  bring  exhibits  and  programming 
to  public  housing  in  East  Harlem,  ideally  transform¬ 
ing  the  facility  into  a  community  hub  and  a  model  for 
future  museum  and  public  housing  collaborations.  In 
2013,  the  NIH  will  publish  CMOM’s  EatPlayGrow™ 
curriculum  as  a  federally  approved  health  curriculum 
for  early  childhood  audiences. 


IDAHO:  STATEWIDE  APPROACH  TO 
BUILDING  EARLY  LITERACY  AND 
READING 

There  is  growing  consensus  in  Idaho  that  school-ready 
children  reading  at  grade  level  require  a  statewide 
system  of  support.  Libraries  and  their  partners  are 
building  a  collaborative  effort  to  educate  the  public  and 
unite  stakeholders  to  increase  early  literacy  for  their 
youngest  citizens. 

The  Idaho  Commission  for  Libraries  (ICfL)  launched 
a  statewide  effort  to  increase  the  reading  readiness  of 
Idaho  children  by  building  the  capacity  of  families  and 
caregivers  to  nurture  literacy  skills  and  support  chil¬ 
dren’s  development  as  independent  readers  and  lifelong 
learners.  Focused  primarily  on  low-income  rural  fami¬ 
lies  with  young  children,  “Routes  to  Reading:  Idaho 
Paves  the  Way  with  Access  to  Print”  will  address  a  critical 
need  to  increase  access  to  books;  provide  information  to 
families  and  caregivers  on  how  to  support  early  literacy 
development;  and  address  the  challenge  of  encouraging 
low-income  families  to  check  out  books  by  building  the 
institutional  capacity  to  effectively  serve  families. 

In  Idaho,  43  percent  of  young  children  enter  school 
unprepared,  31  percent  of  fourth  graders  score  below  the 
national  basic  reading  level,  and  state  funding  for  early 
learning  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  country.  To  address 
those  challenges,  the  Routes  to  Reading  strategy  includes 
services  and  supports  for  families  and  caregivers  and  the 
development  of  a  statewide  network  of  communities  to 
sustain  and  increase  place-based  literacy  plans.  Services 
to  families,  caregivers,  and  children  include: 


Books  to  Go,  providing  continuous,  convenient,  no- 
cost  avenues  to  access  themed  book  bags  with  exten¬ 
sion  activities  available  for  check-out  from  local 
early  learning  programs  (reading  partners)  including 
Head  Start,  child  care  centers,  and  family  child  care 
homes.  Books  to  Go  kits  will  be  available  statewide 
at  250  reading  partner  sites,  ultimately  reaching  over 
15,000  children; 

Virtual  Story  Time,  a  parent-friendly  web-based 
resource  to  access  e-books  and  activities  in  English 
and  Spanish,  video  clips  modeling  use  of  fingerplays, 
rhymes,  and  songs,  as  well  as  other  educational 
information;  and 

Access  to  professional  development  and  training  for 
reading  partners  and  other  local  providers.  Through 
a  partnership  with  the  Idaho  Association  for  the 
Education  of  Young  Children,  training  participants 
can  attain  Idaho  STARS  credit — the  state’s  early 
childhood  quality  rating  and  improvement  system. 

A  third-party  evaluator  is  working  with  the  Books  to 
Go  program  to  conduct  qualitative  analysis  of  partici¬ 
pant  perspectives  and  a  quasi-experimental  evaluation 
measuring  the  impact  on  early  literacy  development.

CHILDREN'S  MUSEUM  OF  HOUSTON: 
BUILDING  COMMUNITY  THROUGH 
PROGRAMS  AND  PARTNERSHIPS 


To  meet  the  learning  challenges  of  Houston  families 
most  in  need,  the  Children’s  Museum  (CMH)  takes  an 
intentional  approach  to  developing  programming  and 
services.  The  museum  participates  in  the  city’s  Cam¬ 
paign  for  Grade-Level  Reading  initiative  and  designs  all 
of  its  programs  for  national  replication  and  scalability. 


Some  of  CMH’s  major  programs  and  partnerships 
include: 

The  Family  Literacy  Involvement  Program  (FLIP), 
developed  in  partnership  with  the  Houston  Public 
Library.  FLIP  is  a  citywide  system  to  increase 
family  learning  by  circulating  2,040  literacy  kits  that 
include  a  book  and  hands-on  activities  to  build  lit¬ 
eracy  skills.  Developed  with  support  from  the  Chil¬ 
dren’s  Learning  Institute  at  the  University  of  Texas, 
the  kits  are  research-based  and  now  used  in  cities 
across  the  country.  An  evaluation  of  the  FLIP  kits  on 
home  reading  practices  and  parental  understanding 
of  children’s  skills  and  interests  showed  significant 
differences  between  the  treatment  and  control  fami¬ 
lies.  Currently,  the  museum  and  library  are  partner¬ 
ing  to  use  FLIP  kits  as  part  of  a  Pop-Up  Library 
program  designed  to  address  summer  learning  loss. 

Parent  Stars,  developed  in  partnership  with  the  Hous¬ 
ton  Independent  School  District,  provides  adults 


with  activities  and  strategies  to  support  children’s 
math,  reading,  and  science  learning  out  of  school. 
All  activities  align  with  state  standards  and  specific 
elementary  levels.  School  administrators  choose 
from  options  to  design  their  own  programs,  which 
are  then  directed  by  CMH  staff.  Programs  include 
both  family  learning  events  and  parent  workshops. 

A’STEAM  (Afterschool  Science,  Technology,  Engi¬ 
neering,  Art,  and  Math)  trains  after-school  program 
facilitators  to  engage  children  in  over  40  CMH 
Investigations  that  include  a  series  of  challenges  to 
apply  their  knowledge  and  collaboratively  solve  real- 
world  style  problems.  The  museum  partners  with 
the  YMCA  of  Greater  Houston  to  implement  cur¬ 
riculum  units  over  the  summer  months. 

CMH,  in  partnership  with  the  Houston  Public 
Library,  designed  Para  Los  Ninos  workshops  to  help 
Spanish-speaking  families  engage  their  young  chil¬ 
dren  in  educational  activities.  In  Houston,  the  pro¬ 
gram  serves  7,000  parents  and  children  per  year  and 
is  delivered  in  over  30  public  libraries  in  the  Houston 
area;  it  has  been  adopted  by  other  libraries  nationally. 

2 1-Tech  allows  visitors  to  learn  about  exhibits  through 
personal  mobile  technologies  (PMT’s).  Trained 
museum  facilitators  use  the  technology  to  directly 
involve  children  and  families  in  learning  through  a 
growing  number  of  curated  apps  linked  to  museum 
exhibits,  including  “Tot  Spot,”  an  interactive  play 
space  for  children  under  three. 


WASHINGTON  STATE:  GETTING  TO  THE 
TABLE 

By  proactively  responding  to  new  initiatives  and  policy 
actions,  libraries  across  Washington  have  secured  their 
position  as  key  players  in  statewide  early  learning  efforts. 

In  1998,  the  Governor’s  Commission  on  Early  Learning 
convened  to  identify  and  address  early  learning  chal¬ 
lenges.  Libraries  sought  but  were  unsuccessful  in  gain¬ 
ing  a  place  on  the  Commission.  Undeterred,  a  group 
of  librarians  obtained  funds  from  the  State  Library 
to  develop  their  own  project,  the  Washington  Early 
Learning  Initiative  (2000-2003),  which  built  a  strong 
foundation  for  early  education  in  Washington  libraries 
and  established  partnerships  with  other  child-serving 
organizations.  According  to  the  program  director,  “We 
may  not  have  been  at  the  first  table,  the  governor’s  com¬ 
mission.  But  we  had  succeeded  in  bringing  members  of 
this  group  and  others  to  our  table  and  opening  a  dia¬ 
logue  with  organizations  and  agencies  previously  unfa¬ 
miliar  with  public  library  service”  (Nelson,  2001). 

Additional  funding  enabled  libraries  to  expand  their 
role  as  partners  in  early  literacy  and  learning  initiatives, 
but  they  still  desired  more  permanent  partnerships  in 
the  statewide  infrastructure.  In  2007,  the  Early  Learn¬ 
ing  Public  Library  Partnership  (ELPLP)  was  formed. 
Members  (26  public  libraries)  contribute  an  agreed- 
upon  percentage  of  their  annual  operating  budgets 
to  contract  with  the  Foundation  for  Early  Learning, 
which,  in  turn,  assists  libraries  and  others  to  establish 
early  learning  partnerships  and  enter  the  mainstream  of 
early  learning  efforts.  Activities  include:  providing  leg¬ 
islative  testimony  in  support  of  continuing  state  early 
learning  funding;  providing  input  on  the  development 


of  the  Washington  State  Early  Learning  Plan;  hosting 
Early  Learning  Community  Fairs;  serving  as  mem¬ 
bers  of  community  early  learning  coalitions;  and  com¬ 
missioning  an  evaluation  study  of  the  effectiveness  of 
library  story  times. 

In  2006,  a  task  force  of  library  directors  identified  the 
lack  of  outcome-based  evaluation  of  library  programs 
and  documentation  of  best  practices  as  a  barrier  to 
participation  in  state  early  learning  and  literacy  ini¬ 
tiatives.  Assessment  and  monitoring  of  outcomes  was 
a  well-established  priority  for  the  state,  and  libraries 
recognized  the  need  to  find  valid  and  reliable  means 
to  measure  early  literacy  outcomes.  The  LIniversity  of 
Washington  Information  School,  in  partnership  with 
the  with  the  ELPLP,  the  Foundation  for  Early  Learn¬ 
ing  and  the  State  Library,  designed  a  rigorous  assess¬ 
ment  of  library  story  times  on  child  outcomes,  which  is 
currently  underway. 

The  team  first  developed  tools  to  measure  outcomes  for 
children  in  informal  settings  and  then  collected  data 
in  40  libraries  randomly  chosen  throughout  the  state. 
Using  the  results  of  the  year-one  data,  in  year  two  the 
team  developed  a  research-based  training  and  delivered 
it  to  a  selected  random  sample  of  20  librarians.  After  a 
second  data  collection,  statistical  analysis  will  compare 
the  children  and  librarians  in  the  experimental  group 
with  those  in  the  control  group  to  determine  whether 
these  children  demonstrate  more  growth  in  early  liter¬ 
acy  skills.  The  project  will  also  document  improvements 
in  story  times  specifically  related  to  early  learning.  In 
year  three  of  the  project,  stated  outcomes  will  be  used 
to  strengthen  partnerships  around  early  literacy  prac¬ 
tices  and  findings  and  tools  will  be  disseminated  to 
other  libraries  and  states. 


RICHMOND  PUBLIC  LIBRARY:  FROM 
SUMMER  SLIDETO  SUMMER  SUCCESS 

The  Richmond  Public  Library  has  a  long  history  of 
identifying  community  needs  and  working  with  com¬ 
munity  partners  to  provide  solutions.  Based  on  this 
expertise,  the  library  serves  as  the  lead  agency  for  Rich¬ 
mond’s  Campaign  for  Grade-Level  Reading  Initiative 
and  as  the  coordinating  agency  for  an  innovative  effort 
to  reverse  summer  learning  loss  for  young  Richmond 
readers. 

The  “From  Summer  Slide  to  Summer  Success”  project 
is  developing  and  evaluating  a  summer  reading  inter¬ 
vention  implemented  in  five  classrooms  within  four 
non-library  summer  recreation  sites.  The  project  was 
conceived  to  engage  hard-to-reach  non-library  users 
over  the  summer.  Library  staff  believed  linking  a  lit¬ 
eracy  curriculum  with  recreational  summer  programs 
offered  an  effective  and  replicable  outreach  strategy. 

The  curriculum,  developed  in  partnership  with  the 
Virginia  Commonwealth  University  Literacy  Institute, 
includes  three  components  as  well  as  an  assessment. 
The  components  include  a  staff  read-aloud,  daily  inde¬ 
pendent  reading,  and  “buddy  reading,”  with  opportuni¬ 
ties  for  daily  writing,  all  tied  to  a  summer  theme,  for 
example,  “water.”  The  library  identifies  popular  book 
titles  for  each  reading  level  to  fit  the  theme.  The  the¬ 
matic  approach  to  the  curriculum  creates  an  easy  bridge 
to  the  recreation  programs.  The  library  then  serves  as 
the  hub  for  additional  literacy-based  activities,  including 
participation  in  the  library’s  Summer  Reading  Program. 


Program  evaluation  uses  a  pre-/post-test  approach. 
Prior  to  implementing  the  project,  the  evaluation  team 
will  assess  individual  child  needs  with  standard  evalu¬ 
ative  tools,  and  the  program  will  be  adjusted  accord¬ 
ingly  to  best  meet  the  needs  of  participating  children. 
In  addition,  project  leaders  will  assess  capacity  of  library 
staff  and  availability  of  other  library  resources  to  sup¬ 
port  recreation  staff  as  literacy  partners.  By  establish¬ 
ing  a  consistent  baseline  for  participating  children,  the 
library  will  be  able  to  determine  whether  children’s’  lit¬ 
eracy  skills  decreased,  stayed  the  same,  or  improved  as  a 
result  of  the  program. 


PITTSBURGH:  A  LIVING  LEARNING 
COMMUNITY  ALIVE  WITH  CREATIVITY 
AND  OPPORTUNITY 

The  Greater  Pittsburgh  Region  is  developing  a  21st  cen¬ 
tury  model  to  provide  children  of  all  ages  with  opportu¬ 
nities  for  creative,  collaborative,  and  connected  learning. 
Leading  this  regional  effort  is  the  Kids+Creativity  Net¬ 
work,  a  consortium  of  more  than  100  organizations, 
including  university-based  research  labs,  museums, 
libraries  and  informal  learning  institutions,  school  dis¬ 
tricts  and  educational  start-ups,  child-serving  agencies, 
and  civic  leaders.  Supported  by  the  region’s  philan¬ 
thropic  community,  and  more  recently  through  the  The 
Sprout  Fund,  the  network  has  been  meeting,  exchanging 
ideas,  and  collaborating  since  2007. 

To  support  early  childhood  education,  The  Fred  Rogers 
Center  maintains  the  Early  Learning  Environment,  or 
Ele™,  an  online  hub  where  educators,  families,  and 
others  who  care  for  young  children  can  find  and  share 
quality  digital  resources  that  support  early  learning  and 
development. 

With  a  specific  focus  on  early  literacy,  the  United  Way 
of  Allegheny  County  is  coordinating  a  new  early  child¬ 
hood  education  affinity  group  to  act  as  the  early  liter¬ 
acy  task  force  supporting  the  Pittsburgh  Campaign  for 
Grade-Level  Reading. 

The  Allegheny  County  Library  Association  (ACLA) 
supports  the  language  and  literacy  development  of 
young  children  through  programs  such  as  Questyinz, 
an  online  club  that  engages  young  readers  in  interactive 
challenges  that  connect  their  book  learning  with  their 


lived  experience.  During  summer  2012,  children  read 
for  more  than  2.5  million  minutes  and  completed  more 
than  150,000  learning  activities. 

The  Carnegie  Library  of  Pittsburgh  has  developed  digi¬ 
tal  technologies  like  the  My  Story  Maker  program,  a 
game-based  tool  that  helps  children  compose  stories  by 
placing  characters  and  objects  on  a  storyboard  template, 
bringing  it  to  life  with  their  own  ideas.  Kids  then  share 
their  stories  through  digital  publication  and  printing. 
The  Children’s  Museum  of  Pittsburgh  has  been  a  leader 
in  supporting  learning  for  young  children  and  families 
throughout  the  Greater  Pittsburgh  region.  The  museum 
houses  two  Pittsburgh  Public  School  Head  Start  class¬ 
rooms  and  an  office  of  the  LTiversity  of  Pittsburgh 
Center  for  Learning  in  Out-of-School  Environments 
(UPCLOSE),  a  research  initiative  studying  informal 
learning  institutions.  The  museum’s  MAKESHOP  is 
a  do-it-yourself  maker  space  integrating  hands-on  and 
digital  media  and  production  experiences  with  inquiry- 
based  learning,  early  literacy,  and  STEM. 

The  Children’s  Museum  has  also  played  a  central  role 
in  the  development  of  Pittsburgh’s  Northside  neighbor¬ 
hood.  The  museum’s  Charm  Bracelet  project  brought 
together  over  20  cultural,  recreational,  and  educational 
organizations  to  create  a  linked  and  easily  navigated 
system  of  opportunities  and  experiences  for  families 
and  children,  including  the  Pittsburgh  Mini-Maker 
Faire.  The  museum  recently  partnered  with  the  Pitts¬ 
burgh  Association  for  the  Education  of  Young  Children 
(PAEYC)  to  offer  members  and  families  significantly 
reduced  admission,  a  service  also  provided  to  those 
holding  EBT  public  assistance  cards.

MIAMI  SCIENCE  MUSEUM:  EVALUATING 
THE  IMPACT  OF  A  COMPREHENSIVE 
EARLY  LEARNING  SCIENCE  CURRIC¬ 
ULUM  ON  CHILDREN  ANDTEACHERS 

The  Center  for  Interactive  Learning  at  the  Miami  Sci¬ 
ence  Museum  is  a  joint  venture  with  the  University  of 
Miami.  Designed  to  link  informal  science  education 
and  the  formal  education  and  research  community, 
the  Center  developed  the  Early  Childhood  Hands-on 
Science  (ECHOS®)  model,  which  includes  a  com¬ 
prehensive  early  learning  science  curriculum,  a  set 
of  assessment  tools  and  a  professional  development 
program.  ECHOS’s  goal  is  to  investigate  science  as  a 
domain  for  enhancing  school  readiness  and  to  demon¬ 
strate  that  young  children  can  learn  fundamental  sci¬ 
ence  concepts  and  the  process  skills  associated  with 
higher-order  thinking.  The  fully  developed  preschool 
science  curriculum  consists  of  nine  units,  each  con¬ 
taining  four  guided  week-long  science  lessons  that  are 
introduced  in  20-minute  segments  to  small  groups  of 
children.  A  teacher  assistant  and/or  volunteer  simulta¬ 
neously  works  with  the  balance  of  the  children  using 
related  integration  cards  in  three  domains:  language/ 
literacy,  math,  and  creative  arts. 

The  36  ECHOS  lessons  follow  a  project-designed  learn¬ 
ing  sequence  providing  teachers  with  a  logical  structure 
to  deliver  lessons  that  combines  direct  instruction  with 
guided  inquiry-based  science  experiences  and  explora¬ 
tion.  The  “E-I-E-I-O”  learning  framework  offers  teach¬ 
ers  an  instructional  roadmap  to  walk  children  through  a 
consistent  series  of  steps:  Excite... to  create  interest  and 
generate  curiosity;  Introduce... to  undertake  the  inves¬ 
tigation;  Explore... to  deepen  understanding  through 


questioning,  making  prediction,  recording  data,  and 
looking  for  patterns;  Interact... as  needed  to  respond 
to  individual  strengths  and  needs;  and  Outcomes... 
to  observe  evidence  of  learning  and  determine  need 
to  re-teach  key  concepts.  The  museum’s  website  at 
www.miamisci.org/echos  contains  short  videos  of  the 
program  in  action. 

A  quasi-experimental  study  conducted  by  the  Univer¬ 
sity  of  Miami  in  30  Miami-Dade  County  Head  Start 
classrooms  examined  the  efficacy  of  the  curriculum. 
Results  found  significant  differences  between  teach¬ 
ers  and  children  in  ECHOS  classrooms  as  opposed 
to  classrooms  where  ECHOS  was  not  implemented. 
Teachers  in  the  ECHOS  classrooms  exhibited  more 
science-related  behavior  and  felt  more  comfortable 
teaching  science.  Children  in  the  ECHOS  classrooms 
also  exhibited  higher  rates  of  science  behavior  and 
scored  higher  on  science  readiness  tests.  A  subsequent 
two-year  Randomized  Control  Trial  in  90  Head  Start 
classrooms  is  nearing  completion. 

Analyses  at  the  end  of  the  first  year  show  preliminary 
evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  ECHOS  that  is  con¬ 
sistent  with  the  previous  study.  A  series  of  repeated- 
measures  analysis  of  variance  (ANOYA)  revealed  that 
ECHOS  teachers  significantly  improved  their  scores  in 
use  of  instructional  strategies  associated  with  higher- 
order  thinking  skills,  specifically  predicting,  investigat¬ 
ing,  and  evaluating,  across  the  year,  while  control  group 
teachers  did  not. 


BOSTON  CHILDREN'S  MUSEUM: 

FROM  COMMUNITY-WIDE  TO 
STATEWIDE  IMPACT 

The  Boston  Children’s  Museum,  now  celebrating  its 
centenary,  led  museums  nationwide  in  focusing  on 
children  zero  to  three.  In  1998,  the  museum  began  a 
partnership  with  Action  for  Boston  Community  Devel¬ 
opment  Head  Start  that  led,  in  2003,  to  Countdown 
to  Kindergarten,  a  multi-institutional,  private-public 
partnership  that  aims  to  enhance  early  learning  oppor¬ 
tunities  with  a  focus  on  the  transition  to  kindergarten. 

In  2010,  the  museum  opened  a  permanent  Countdown 
to  Kindergarten  exhibit  that  simulates  a  kindergarten 
classroom.  Children  and  families  engage  in  hands-on 
activities  while  familiarizing  themselves  with  the  kin¬ 
dergarten  environment.  Adults  can  ask  staff  “teachers” 
questions  about  the  kindergarten  registration  process, 
child  development  milestones,  and  school  readiness. 
Children  can  practice  taking  turns,  making  a  friend,  or 
sitting  in  a  group  circle  to  hear  a  story.  The  classroom 
has  areas  for  math  and  science,  dramatic  play,  reading 
and  writing,  and  creative  arts.  Since  opening  in  August 
2010,  the  exhibit  has  welcomed  1.7  million  visitors.  Over 
6,000  people  participated  in  the  past  three  Countdown 
to  Kindergarten  celebrations  and  5,000  people  from 
community  groups  participated  in  33  Friday  School 
Readiness  Friday  nights. 

The  museum’s  leadership  in  Boston’s  early  learn¬ 
ing  community  has  led  to  its  major  role  in  the  Com¬ 
monwealth  of  Massachusetts’  Race  to  the  Top  Early 
Learning  Challenge  Grant.  The  Commonwealth’s 


Department  of  Early  Education  and  Care  engaged  the 
museum  as  a  core  partner  in  its  family  engagement  and 
school  readiness  activities.  The  museum  has  mobi¬ 
lized  55  libraries  and  68  museums  across  the  state  to 
bring  their  content,  expertise,  and  programs  to  families 
and  to  strengthen  connections  with  the  Coordinated 
Family  and  Community  Engagement  (CFCE)  special¬ 
ists  throughout  the  state  to  connect  with  the  hardest 
to  reach  populations.  (Public  libraries  currently  house 
state-supported  Early  Childhood  Resource  Centers.)  A 
state-level  team  led  by  Boston  Children’s  Museum  staff 
is  conducting  a  series  of  regional  meetings  designed  to 
facilitate  connections  across  CFCE  grantees  and  local 
libraries  and  museums  to  bring  these  communities  the 
early  learning  and  service  supports  they  need. 

The  focus  areas  of  the  statewide  museum  and  library 
activities  (which  build  on  the  Boston  Children’s  Museum 
expertise  and  professional  development  experience) 
have  been  STEM  learning  (with  the  Boston  Children’s 
Museum  distributing  STEM  kits  to  all  the  partner 
organizations),  school  readiness,  early  literacy,  and  par¬ 
ticipation  in  the  “Brain  Building  in  Progress”  public 
awareness  campaign  spearheaded  by  the  State  Depart¬ 
ment  of  Early  Education  and  Care  and  the  United  Way 
of  Massachusetts  Bay  and  Merrimack  Valley.  Participat¬ 
ing  libraries  and  museums  receive  a  “pop-up”  kinder¬ 
garten  classroom  kit  in  a  box  filled  with  resource  sheets, 
DVDs,  and  graphics  they  can  use  to  create  a  kinder¬ 
garten  classroom  program  in  their  institutions.  In  addi¬ 
tion,  the  Boston  Children’s  Museum’s  school  readiness 
play,  “DW  Counts  Down  to  Kindergarten,”  will  be  pre¬ 
sented  at  several  sites  across  the  state.

Growing  Young  Minds 


BALTIMORE  CITY:  JOINING  FORCES  FOR  care  programs  that  lack  other  access  to  literacy-based 
SCHOOL  READINESS  services  and  materials. 


In  Baltimore,  libraries,  museums,  community  agencies, 
city  officials,  schools,  preschools,  and  Head  Start  pro¬ 
grams  are  focused  on  making  sure  all  young  children, 
from  birth,  have  the  opportunities  they  need  to  start 
school  ready  to  learn. 

1 

Together,  the  Enoch  Pratt  Library  and  The  Walters 
Art  Museum  play  active  roles  in  community-based  ini¬ 
tiatives  such  as  the  annual  Countdown  to  Kindergarten 
Celebration  and  PreK  at  Play  event  that  brings  young 
children  and  their  families  into  the  community  to 
explore  cultural,  recreational,  and  neighborhood  sites. 
Leaders  from  each  institution  routinely  convene  all 
library  and  museum  providers  in  the  city  to  plan  ways 
to  engage  families.  In  addition,  both  have  worked  to 
align  their  programs  and  services  with  the  Maryland 
Department  of  Education’s  Maryland  Model  for  School 
Readiness. 

The  Enoch-Pratt’s  summer  learning  programs  include 
a  partnership  with  the  Department  of  Parks  and  Recre¬ 
ation  and  the  School  District  for  the  “Super  Summer” 
program  that  targets  underperforming  readers.  The 
program  combines  a  half  day  of  district-run  summer 
school  with  wrap-around  services  from  recreation  cen¬ 
ters  to  provide  a  full  day  of  enrichment  and  targeted 
intervention.  Other  summer  programs  include  an 
incentive-based  reading  program  begun  in  the  1930s 
with  a  comprehensive  set  of  enrichment  opportuni¬ 
ties,  and  an  outreach  program,  “Summer  Reading  in 
a  Kit,”  bringing  books,  reading  logs,  and  incentives  to 
community-based  programs  such  as  church-run  day 


At  the  Walters,  education  programs  are  designed  to 
“grow  with  families,”  offering  a  menu  of  offerings  scaf¬ 
folded  across  stages  of  child  development.  Children’s 
developmental  needs  are  supported  through  age-appro¬ 
priate,  object-based,  and  art-integrated  learning  experi¬ 
ences,  including  Waltee’s  Cubs  Baby  Programs,  ArtTots 
Toddler  Programs,  ArtKids  Preschool  Programs,  and 
Start  with  Art  Preschool  Programs. 

Enoch  Pratt  Free  Library  and  Baltimore  Department 
of  Health  staff  members  co-chair  the  school  readiness 
committee  of  Baltimore  City’s  Campaign  for  Grade- 
Level  Reading.  This  joint  leadership  grew  out  of  a  part¬ 
nership  between  the  two  organizations,  which  targeted 
young  hrst-time  mothers  to  increase  their  abilities  to 
support  their  children’s  early  literacy  development. 
Trained  by  library  staff  to  deliver  the  Every  Child 
Ready  to  Read  model,  home  health  care  workers  pro¬ 
vide  guidance  and  information  to  young  parents  during

SCHOOL  LIBRARIES  AND  STUDENT  ACHIEVEMENT 


School  Librarians  Are  Linked 
to  Improved  Standardized

Studies  conducted  over  the  past  two  decades,  both  in 
Colorado  and  nationwide,  show  that  students  in  schools 
with  endorsed  librarians  score  better  on  standardized 
achievement  tests  in  reading,  compared  with  students 
in  schools  without  endorsed  librarians.

ARLINGTON  COUNTY,  VIRGINIA: 
SCHOOL  LIBRARIES  MAKING  A 
DIFFERENCE 

School  librarians  in  Arlington  County  Public  Schools 
(APS)  play  an  integral  role  in  school-wide  efforts  to 
advance  children’s  reading  skills.  Through  collection 
planning  and  acquisition,  school  libraries  support  read¬ 
ing  proficiency  across  the  developmental  continuum, 
reading  and  technology  specialists  working  with  librar¬ 
ians  and  teachers  to  address  remedial  and  advanced 
reading  needs.  For  children  with  special  needs,  library 
resources  include  oral  reading,  interactive  technology, 
role  play,  and  audio  and  video  accommodations.  Assess¬ 
ment  data  enable  the  librarian,  teachers,  and  specialists 
to  work  together  to  guide  instruction  and  offer  special 
learning  experiences,  such  as  hosting  visiting  authors  or 
implementing  reading  initiatives. 

Schools  have  a  strong  relationship  with  local  public 
libraries  and  museums,  using  their  resources  to 
enhance  and  expand  school-based  instruction.  To 
address  the  issue  of  summer  learning  loss,  school  and 
public  librarians  jointly  plan  reading  incentives  and 


an  end-of-the-year  transition  from  the  school  library 
to  the  public  library.  Virginia  is  not  a  Common  Core 
Standards  (CCSS)  state,  but  APS  has  established  cross¬ 
system  collaboration  to  link  public  school  teachers, 
specialists,  school  librarians,  and  public  librarians  to 
provide  children  access  to  robust  and  relevant  experi¬ 
ences  and  resources,  called  for  in  the  state’s  Standards  of 
Learning,  which  build  needed  skills  and  knowledge.  As 
digital  hubs,  school  libraries  provide  students  access  to 
high-quality  technology  resources.  Librarians  use  tech¬ 
nology  to  model  knowledge  integration  across  content 
areas  and  plan  differentiated  instruction  approaches 
based  on  student  needs  and  interests. 

In  one  Arlington  school,  students  are  being  introduced 
to  a  problem-based  learning  model  (PBL)  for  teaching 
STEM  (science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math)  at 
the  elementary  level.  Digital  capacity  and  collections 
place  school  libraries  at  the  center  of  this  work.  Col¬ 
laboration  between  the  librarian,  technology  special¬ 
ist,  teachers,  and  instructional  specialists  has  resulted 
in  a  cultural  shift  in  the  school  and  increased  students’ 
abilities  to  document  their  learning  through  a  variety  of 
tools  and  apps.
