The  University's  Board  of  Re¬ 
gents  meeting  was  held  Thurs¬ 
day  in  the  J.W.  Jones  Student 
Union. 

The  meeting  opened  with 
Drs.  Gary  and  Merry 
McDonald  speaking  on  com¬ 
puter  science  and  information 
systems.  Merry  McDonald 
spoke  about  how  information 
systems  can  be  used  to  enhance 
Northwest's  computer  system 
'*>'  for  both  faculty  and  students. 

Jamie  Roop,  president  of  Stu¬ 
dent  Senate,  announced  that 
Student  Senate  had  begun  set- 
*  ting  goals  for  next  year.  Roop 
stated  that  during  an  executive 
student  retreat  the  University's 
u  mission  statement  and  commu¬ 
nication  flow  chart  had  been 
revised. 

Kitty  Kennedy  from  Support 
Staff  Council  stated  that  it  had 
employed  the  services  of  Pub¬ 
lic  Relations  Student  Society  of 
America  to  promote  and  en¬ 
hance  the  image  of  the  support 
staff. 


"The  first  project  of  PRSSA  is 
a  survey  which  will  be  dis¬ 
tributed  to  students,  adminis- 
tors,  faculty  and  support  staff 
personnel,"  Kennedy  said. 

According  to  Kennedy,  the 
purpose  of  the  survey  will  be  to 
determine  how  support  staff 
and  council  are  perceived. 

Faculty  Senate  stated  it  had 
appointed  a  special  senate  com¬ 
mittee  to  review  the  faculty 
handbook.  The  faculty  hand¬ 
book  is  currently  under  revi¬ 
sion.  The  committee  is  plan¬ 
ning  to  bring  its  recommenda¬ 
tions  to  the  senate  for  consider¬ 
ation  in  March  or  April,  1990. 

Faculty  Senate  also  an¬ 
nounced  it  had  appointed  an 
advisory  committee  regarding 
Gov.  Ashcroft's  challenges  to 
higher  education. 

The  Board  of  Regents  ap¬ 
proved  and  accepted  several 
appointments,  resignations  and 
retirements  at  the  meeting. 

Those  approved  for  appoint¬ 
ments  were:  Dr.  George  L.

Board  Meeting— The  Board  of  Regents  recently  met  to  discuss  the 
enhancement  of  the  computer  systems,  to  approve  resignations, 
appointments  and  retirements,  along  with  listening  to  commit¬ 
tee  reports.  The  next  meeting  will  be  held  in  March. 


Taylor  Commons 
closing  possible 


Dr.  Dean  Hubbard,  Dr.  Phil  Hayes  and  Jerry 
Throener  were  at  Tuesday's  Student  Senate  meet¬ 
ing  to  speak  about  the  future  plans  for  University 
dining  . 

The  article  in  last  week's  issue  of  the  Missourian 
entitled  "ARA  plans  approved"  was  inaccurate.  Plans 
were  presented,  but  not  approved. 

Hubbard  said  the  current  minimum  wage  law  will 
be  increased  to  $3.80  per  hour  on  April  1  and  will 
again  increase  to  $4.25  per  hour  on  Jan.  1,  1991.  Hub¬ 
bard  stated  that  these  increases  will  raise  campus 
dining  costs  about  $2,437.50  per  week  unless  great¬ 
er  efficiencies  can  be  figured  out. 

Taylor  Commons  is  "drastically  under  utilized,"  ac¬ 
cording  to  Hubbard.  "The  average  ratio  is  one  em¬ 
ployee  to  every  two  students  eating  there  and  that's 
a  major  problem." 

Hubbard  also  said  that  $116,500  in  equipment  is 
needed  at  Taylor  Commons  to  update  the  facility. 

Two  possible  options  were  explained  to  the  sena¬ 
tors.  One  option  would  involve  closing  Taylor  Com¬ 
mons  next  year  and  improving  and  changing  facili¬ 
ties  in  the  Union.  This  option  would  not  involve  a 
fee  increase. 

The  other  option  would  be  to  leave  Taylor  Com¬ 
mons  open  as  a  dining  facillity  but  this  would  make 
a  fee  increase  necessary. 

A  set  of  floor  plans  has  been  drawn  up  that  would 
possibly  move  Campus  Safety  out  of  the  Union  and 
move  the  location  of  the  gameroom  to  open  the  area 
for  a  "scramble". 

The  "scramble"  would  offer  a  variety  of  foods  such 
as  Italian,  Mexican,  Chinese  and  chicken  and  fish. 
Hubbard  said  the  new  dining  facility  would  take  care 
of  some  congestion  during  meal  times. 

Questions  were  raised  concerning  what  would 
happen  to  Taylor  Commons  in  the  event  of  its  clos¬ 
ing.  Hubbard  said  that  there  is  a  possibility  of  turn¬ 
ing  Taylor  Commons  into  a  conference  center  that 
could  be  rented  out.

Students 

protest 

ruling 

SEAN  GREEN 
Opinion  Editor 

Residents  of  South  Complex 
~&e'  protesting  the  recent-restric¬ 
tion  of  parking  privileges  to 
students  in  parking  lot  two,  lo¬ 
cated  in  front  of  North-South 
Complex. 

The  Parking  Advisory  Com¬ 
mittee  restricted  student  use  of 
the  parking  lot  in  order  to  pro¬ 
vide  24-hour  parking  for  faculty 
and  other  non-students  on 
evenings  and  weekends.  But 
South  Complex  resident  An¬ 
drea  McAlpin  said  the  action 
was  over-compensation  for  a 
minor  problem. 

"We  can  understand  the 
faculty  needing  more  parking 
space  but  we  think  the  stu¬ 
dent's  point  of  view  should  also 
be  considered,"  she  said. 

McAlpin  listed  several  rea¬ 
sons  for  returning  some  park¬ 
ing  privileges  to  the  students. 

"The  most  important 
problem  this  ruling  has  created 
involves  safety,"  she  said. 

She  explained  if  one  of  the 
250  residents  of  South  Com¬ 
plex,  two-thirds  of  which  are 
women,  is  unable  to  get  one  of 
the  twenty  parking  spaces  by 
the  building,  they  have  to  park 
in  the  lot  west  of  the  National 
Guard  Armory.

University  health  care  costs  increase 


PAT  SCHURKAMP 
Assistant  News  Editor 

The  cost  of  health  care  cover¬ 
age  for  Northwest  faculty  and 
staff  has  risen  over  the  last  year. 

According  to  Sandy  Cox, 
director  of  human  services, 
there  was  an  84  percent  in¬ 
crease  for  the  University  in  the 
cost  of  health  care  coverage 
over  1988. 

"For  the  1988-89  fiscal  year, 
$314,000  came  off  the  to]p  of  the 
budget  for  this  department  for 
health  care  cost.  This  fiscal 
year,  $688,000  came  off  the  top," 
Cox  said.  "That  is  a  lot  of 
loney  to  come  off  the  top  of  a 
budget." 

The  reason  for  the  increase  in 
the  cost  of  health  coverage  is 
due  to  a  152  percent  claims  ex¬ 
perience  in  1988,  Cox  ex¬ 
plained.  This  means  the  insur¬ 
ance  company  paid  out  $1.52 
for  every  dollar  it  took  in. 

Those  hardest  hit  with  the 
cost  increase  have  been  the 
faculty  and  staff  who  want 
coverage  for  their  families.  The 


University  pays  for  individual 
health  care  for  the  faculty  and 
staff  but  it  is  the  responsibility 
of  those  individuals  to  pay  for 
family  coverage. 

Since  1985,  health  care  cost 
for  families  has  increased  125 
percent.  As  a  result,  23  percent 
of  those  individuals  who  car¬ 
ried  family  coverage  dropped 
from  the  program  between  July 
and  September  1989. 

"Northwest  has  been  work¬ 
ing  on  keeping  the  cost  down," 
Cox  said.  "We  asked  other 
major  insurance  companies  for 
a  bid  and  found  them  quoting 
anywhere  from  a  140  percent 
increase  to  a  200  percent  in¬ 
crease  over  what  the  Universi¬ 
ty  is  now  paying."  Cox  said  that 
she  preferred  not  to  reveal  the 
names  of  those  companies  who 
had  asked  for  a  bid. 

Although  the  national  trend 
in  health  care  cost  is  projected 
to  be  a  22.7  percent  increase  for 
the  1990-91  fiscal  year,  Cox  stat¬ 
ed  that  the  University  is  hoping 
to  keep  the  insurance  cost  sta¬ 


ble  by  making  changes  in  the 
health  care  plan. 

"The  University  went  to  a 
preferred  health  care  plan  with 
a  higher  deductible,"  Cox  said. 
"We  now  have  an  85  percent 
payment  plan  if  a  local  hospi¬ 
tal  is  usea  for  health  care,  use 
of  a  free  mail  order  if  a  generic 
drug  is  used  and  a  preferred 
eye  care  plan  where  the  in¬ 
dividual  receives  30  percent  off 
glasses  or  lenses  if  a  preferred 
care  provider  is  used," 

Cox  said  that  the  University 
at  one  time  belonged  to  a  group 
plan  organization  with  other 
state  colleges  regarding  health 
care  cost  but  found  it  "more 
favorable  not  to  be  in  it"  given 
Northwest's  claims  experience 
at  the  time.  Northwest  dropped 
from  the  consortium  four  years 
ago. 

"The  University's  rate  is  not 
out  of  line  with  what  other  bus¬ 
inesses  are  paying,"  Cox  said. 
"Ours  is  very  comparable  to

ROTC  cadets  respond  to  First  Lady's  comment 


LAURA  PIERSON 
Staff  Writer 

Northwest's  female  ROTC 
cadets  feel  women  should  be  al¬ 
lowed  to  serve  in  combat. 

The  cadets  were  responding  to 
First  Lady  Barbara  Bush's  com¬ 
ments  on  women  in  combat  that 
arose  from  the  recent  role  mili¬ 
tary  women  played  in  the  Pana¬ 
ma  invasion. 

When  first  telling  the  media 
her  opinion  on  the  issue,  Bush 
responded,  saying  women  were 
not  "physically  strong  enough" 
and  their  presence  on  battlefields 
would  cause  morale  problems. 

Bush  later  added  to  her  state¬ 
ments  made  to  the  press  saying 
that  if  a  woman  could  carry  a 
wounded  soldier  off  a  battlefield 
and  throw  a  grenade  as  far  as  a 
man  could  she  should  be  allowed 
to  serve  in  combat. 

The  cadets  agreed  with  Bush's 
new  statements.  They  felt  combat 
jobs  should  be  open  to  anyone 
who  had  the  right  physical 
capabilities. 

Cadet  Diana  Jensen  questioned 
the  assumption  that  all  men  are 
physically  capable  of  combat 
duty.  "There  are  some  men  we 
all  know  that  we  are  stronger  and 
faster  than." 

Cadet  Anita  Puche  said  during 
field  exercises  the  women  "carry 
the  same  load  and  the  same 
stress"  as  the  men  do. 

Bush's  concern  over  the 
grenade  issue  was  addressed  in 
a  1987  study  that  found  49  per¬ 
cent  of  female  Marine  recruits 


could  not  throw  a  grenade  the  re¬ 
quired  distance  to  avoid  the  burst 
radius. 

Cadet  Brenda  Isreal  disagreed 
with  the  study  saying  the  fe¬ 
males  in  her  battalion  could 
throw  the  grenades  "as  far  as  the 
men  do." 

The  cadets'  wish  to  see  all  com¬ 
bat  jobs  open  to  women  may  not 
be  far  off  in  the  future. 
Represenative  Pat  Schroeder,  D- 
Colo.  is  sponsoring  a  congres¬ 
sional  bill  to  open  up  all  combat 
jobs  to  women  for  a  four-year 
test. 

Schroeder  feels  the  recent 
Panama  invasion  showed  the 
current  U.S.  law  forbidding 
women  in  combat  roles  as  obso¬ 
lete.  In  a  recent  edition  of  "USA 
Today"  she  said,  "Here  we  had, 
in  everyone's  living  room,  young 
women  in  what  looked  like  com¬ 
bat,  sounded  like  combat-the 
reality  of  it  finally  hit." 

Puche  echoed  the  same 
thoughts:  "Someday  we  will  be 
in  combat  even  if  it's  medical 
duty.  We  will  have  to  transport 
wounded  soldiers  from  the  batt¬ 
lefield  to  the  hospital  units." 

ROTC  Capt.  Jeffrey  Knapp  said 
he  would  support  women  in 
combat  roles  if  they  could  first 
pass  a  physical  test  demonstrat¬ 
ing  upper  body  strength.  He 
said,  "This  would  disqualify  the 
majority  of  women." 

He  said  many  women  lack  the 
upper  body  strength  needed  to 
perform  combat  duties.  He  cited 
the  example  of  women's  difficulty 


pulling  back  the  bolt  of  a 
machine  gun  while  lying  on  the 
ground.  The  female  cadets  in  his 
battalion  must  stand  on  their 
knees  to  pull  back  the  spring- 
loaded  bolt.  Knapp  said, "This  is 
not  something  you  want  to  do  in 
combat." 

Knapp  said  women  are  better 
than  men  because  of  better  eye¬ 
sight.  He  continued  saying  that 
while  women  would  make  good 
tank  gunners,  they  could  not  lift 
the  heavy  pieces  of  a  tank  that 
may  need  repair  or  replacement 
on  a  battlefield. 

Both  Knapp  and  the  female 
cadets  see  the  acceptance  of 
women  by  men  in  combat  as  a 
big  problem.- 

Knapp  said,  "My  concern  is 
psychologically  whether  society 
would  accept  it.  If  you  did  it  to¬ 
day  and  put  women  on  the  batt¬ 
lefield  tomorrow  there  would  be 
problems  because  there  has  not 
been  that  psychological  change. 
There  are  a  lot  of  macho  egos  that 
go  with  those  combat  units. 

You  have  to  change  those  atti¬ 
tudes  before  you  put  women  in 
combat.  You  don't  have  a  combat- 
ready  unit  until  they  come  to  that 
understanding." 

Cadet  Diane  Jensen  said,  "We 
would  be  a  weakness  in  their' 
'(men's)  mind."  She  said  some¬ 
times  men  would  shelter  the  fe¬ 
males  on  field  exercises. 

The  cadets  and  Capt.  Knapp 
felt  if  women  are  allowed  to  serve 
in  combat  the  change  will  have 
to  be  intergrated  slowly. 


Ready  For  Combat— A  few  of  the  women,  who  are  part  of 
Northwest's  ROTC,  discuss  their  feelings  about  First  Lady  Bar¬ 
bara  Bush's  comments.  Bush  was  noted  as  referring  to  women 


Photo  by  JoAnn  Bortner 

who  are  enlisted  as  unequal  as  far  as  strength  when  compared 
to  men.  The  women  feel  that  combat  jobs  should  be  open  to 
anyone  who  was  physically  qualified. 


Yearbook  earns  two  high  ratings 


Office  releases 
enrollment  numbers 


•  LAURA  PIERSON 
Staff  Writer 

The  1989  Tower  yearbook  has 
earned  an  All-American  rating 
for  the  sixth  consecutive  year, 
and  a  five-star  rating  for  the  se¬ 
cond  time  from  the  Associated 
Collegiate  Press. 

Debby  Kerr,  a  1989  Northwest 
graduate  from  Edgarton,  was  the 
book's  editor.  Laura  Widmer,  in- 
stuctor  of  mass  communication, 
is' the  yearbook's  advisor. 

Cara ‘Moore,  managing  editor, 
said  an  All-American  rating  goes 
to  "fh’b  'tdp  three'  'percent  of' all 
college  yearbooks  in  the  nations. 
There  are  five  different  catagories 
they  judge  you  on;  copy,  photog¬ 
raphy,  design,  theme  and  con¬ 
cept  and  coverage.  We  received  a 
mark  of  distinction  in  each 
catagory." 

The  five-star  rating  qualifies 
the  yearbook  to  compete  for  the 
Pacemarkers  award  which  goes 
to  the  top  one  percent  in  the  na¬ 
tion.  According  to  Moore,  from 
nearly  a  thousand  entries  less 


than  10  yearbooks  receive 
Pacemakers.  The  1987  and  1988 
Towers  were  Pacemakers.  The 
award  will  not  be  announced  un¬ 
til  April  or  May. 

One  judge  was  so  impressed 
he  wrote  in  the  ACP  critique,  "I 
thoroughly  enjoyed  your  book 
and  will  use  it  as  an  example  of 
fine  work.  You  took  a  fresh  ap¬ 
proach  in  your  reporting  and  co¬ 
vered  the  year  in  an  accurate 
manner.  It  is  nice  to  see  such 
diversity."  f,if 

Moore  said  there:  areino  divi¬ 
sions  for  school  size  in  the  A<TP 
competition.  The  Tower  must 
compete  with  schools  such  as 
Harvard  and  Princeton  for  the 
Pacemaker.  "We  are  the  only 
small  school  with  under  25,000 
students  to  get  a  Pacemaker," 
Moore  said. 

The  theme  of  the  yearbook  was 
"A  Lot  to  be  Said."  According  to 
Widmer,  the  title  was  chosen  be¬ 
cause  the  staff  could  not  agree  on 
the  theme.  Everyone  had  a  differ¬ 
ent  idea  and  they  finally  decid¬ 


ed  there  was  "a  lot  to  be  said". 

Teresa  Mattson,  copy  assistant, 
said  the  staff  goes  on  a  retreat  for 
a  weekend  at  the  start  of  each 
new  school  year.  This  year's 
retreat  was  held  in  Omaha. 

Mattson  said  the  staff  shut 
themselves  into  a  room  to  brain¬ 
storm  for  ideas.  The  staff  looks  to 
many  different  sources  for 
inspiration. 

"We  went  to  cardshops  and 
bookstores.  As  far  as  design 
goes,  we  look  at  trendy  maga¬ 
zines' and  see  what  the  colors  of 
the  year  are.  Our  main  goal  is  we 
want  something  that  is  going  to 
say  'Northwest  this  year',"  Matt¬ 
son  said. 

Moore  and  Mattson  point  to 
Widmer  as  the  key  to  the  year¬ 
book's  success.  Moore  said, 
"Laura  was  editor  of  the  Tower  in 
1979  and  that  was  the  first  year¬ 
book  to  win  an  All-American  rat¬ 
ing.  When  she  came  back  here  to 
teach  in  1983  we  started  getting 
All-American  ratings  from  1984 
through  1989." 


Widmer  said,  "1979  was  the 
first  year  the  University  saw  the 
implementation  of  a  yearbook- 
with  a  magazine  format.  We 
wanted  to  add  more  flash  and 
pizzaz  and  make  it  more  feature 
oriented  and  use  bigger  pictures." 

Widmer  is  quick  to  credit  the 
yearbook  staff  for  the  Tower's 
success,  "They  are  never  happy 
with  the  status  quo.  They  put  in 
many  hours  of  woijk  on  the 
book." 

Moore  said,  "W*db  nbt  set  the  ■ 
goal  Of  winning  an  All-American 
rating.  We  want  to  nrbver  the  year1 
accurately  and  please  the  stu¬ 
dents,  and  the  judges  come 
second." 

One  key  to  success  all  three 
agree  upon  was  that  freshmen 
are  allowed  to  work  on  the  year¬ 
book.  Some  universities  require 
a  student  to  be  a  junior  before  be¬ 
ing  allowed  to  work  on  a  year¬ 
book.  Northwest's  policy  allows 
for  the  staff  to  gain  much  more 
experience  and  expertise  in  de¬ 
veloping  a  yearbook.

Northwest's  enrollment  for 
Spring,  1990  is  up  from  Spring, 
1989  even  though  182  freshmen 
did  not  return  from  the  1989  fall 
semester. 

There  are  5,362  students  en¬ 
rolled  for  the  spring  semester, 
which  is  367  more  than  the 
4,995  students  registered  in 
Spring,  1989. 

Full-time  equivelant  (FTE) 
numbers  for  the  Spring,  1990 
semester  are  4,645  students 
compared  to  last  year's  number 
of  4,368.The  FTE  number  is 
found  by  dividing  the  total 
number  of  undergraduate 
credit  hours  by  12  and  the  total 
graduate  credit  hours  by  nine. 

Dale  Montague,  executive 
director  of  enrollment,  ex¬ 
plained  an  FTE  is  a  student  tak¬ 
ing  12  credit  hours.  "If  you  have 
four  students  taking  one  three- 
hour  credit  course,  put  those 
four  students  together  and  you 
have  one  FTE.  We  have  the 


f:MI*I.OYI:l:  OWNLI) 


equivalent  of  4,645  full-time  stu¬ 
dents  on  campus." 

Montague  credits  the  rise  in 
enrollment  for  this  semester  to 
the  record  number  of  fresh¬ 
men,  1,498,  who  came  to 
Northwest  in  Fall,  1989. 

Montague  said  Northwest  ex¬ 
pects  about  the  same  number 
of  freshmen  for  the  Fall,  1990 
semester  despite  a  20  percent 
decline  in  applications  as 
reported  earlier  this  semester. 

Twenty  percent  of  the  appli¬ 
cations  for  admission  last  year 
were, from  students  who  were 
not  serious  about  attending 
Northwest,  Montague  said. 

"With  the  addition  of  the  ap¬ 
plication  fee  ($10  that  must  ac¬ 
company  all  applications  for 
admissions  beginning  Spring, 
1990)  we  feel  we  have  cut  off 
those  students  who  would  not 
have  attended  anyway.  I  figure 
that  was  the  20  percent,"Mon- 
tague  said. 

He  also  Said,  "We  are  still 
way  ahead  of  where  we  were 
four  years  ago."

Cooperation 


Communication  encouraged 


When  students  are  unhappy  about  something 
involving  campus  life,  there  are  two  main  organi¬ 
zations  which  they  can  use  as  a  vehicle  to  express 
grievances  and  affect  a  change  in  school  policy. 

These  two  organizations  are.  Student  Senate  and 
the  Missourian. 

Unfortunately,  most  students  at  Northwest  feel 
there  is  little  to  be  gained  in  voicing  their  com¬ 
plaints  to  either  of  these  organizations,  which  is 
a  regretful  situation  to  have  in  any  free  society. 

Student  Senate  is  the  highest  level  of  student 
government  where  representatives  from  all  aspects 
of  student  life  gather  to  debate  issues,  express  the 
wishes  and  needs  of  the  people  they  represent  and 
make  decisions  which  shape  and  sometimes 
change  university  policy. 

The  Missourian,  in  addition  to  being  a  means 
of  informing,  entertaining  and  looking  out  for  the 
rights  of  readers,  is  a  forum  in  which  students  can 
make  their  opinions  and  ideas  known  to  the  cam¬ 
pus  as  a  whole. 

This,  in  turn,  fosters  informed  discussion  of  im¬ 
portant  issues  and,  in  many  cases,  also  brings 
about  changes  in  University  policy. 

Not  surprisingly,  the  description  of  these  two  or¬ 
ganizations,  though  they  may  be  somewhat  broad, 
are  quite  similar.  The  logical  conclusion,  then,  is 
that  Student  Senate  and  the  Missourian  are  work¬ 
ing  towards  the  same  goals,  differing  only  in  the 
ways  they  attempt  to  reach  these  goals. 

And  it  should  also  follow  that  if  these  two  or¬ 
ganizations  communicated  better  and  worked 
together  more  closely,  they  would  have  more  suc¬ 
cess  acheiving  their  common  goals  as  well  as  work¬ 
ing  out  any  differences  that  may  arise. 

However,  the  ideal  situation  does  not  match  real¬ 
ity,  or  at  least  not  the  kind  of  perceived  reality  bred 
by  misunderstanding,  unwillingness  to  cooperate 
and,  most  importantly,  the  failure  to  recognize 
vyhat  is  of  is  not  helpful  in  acheiving  the  goals  of 
an  organization. 

The  purpose  of  this  article  is  not  to  lay  blame 
on  anyone,  but  instead  to  encourage,  challenge  and 
perhaps  inspire  both  Student  Senate  and  the  Mis¬ 
sourian  to  attempt  to  work  together  and,  in  doing 
so,  more  capably  and  efficiently  promote  the  in¬ 
terests  of  the  one  group  which  both  organizations 
were  designed  to  benefit... the  students  of 
Northwest. 


Mandatory 

Attendance 


Absentee  policies  questioned 


In  some  courses,  professors  require  that  students 
bring  a  note,  signed  by  a  doctor  to  prove  they  were 
ill.  If  the  student  does  not  provide  this  evidence, 
and  if  the  student  accumulates  a  certain  amount 
of  unexused  absences,  (usually  two  or  three),  their 
grade  begins  to  suffer. 

This  policy  is  what  professors  call  mandatory  at¬ 
tendance  and  we  think  they  should  get  rid  of  it. 

For  traditional  students,  who  usually  live  on  or 
near  campus,  the  mandatory  attendance  policy  can 
be  a  nuisance.  But  for  non-traditional  students, 
many  of  whom  commute  from  out  of  town,  the 
policy  becomes  more  than  a  nuisance,  it  often  costs 
them  time  and  money. 

For  example,  when  someone  is  ill,  they  do  not 
always  visit  a  doctor,  especially  if  they  just  have 
a  cold  or  the  flu.  However,  just  because  someone 
chooses  not  to  seek  medical  attention  it  does  not 
necessarily  mean  they  are  well  enough  to  attend 
class,  especially  if  that  involves  a  long  drive. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  they  do  go  to  a  doctor,  even 
for  something  as  minor  as  the  flu,  the  bill  can  still 
be  $25  to  $30,  which  is  a  ridiculous  amount  of 
money  to  pay  for  the  proverbial  note  from  home. 

And  to  even  call  the  professor,  for  many  com¬ 
muters,  involves  a  long-distance  charge  they  could 
probably  do  without. 

The  best  thing  to  do  would  be  to  totally  throw 
out  all  mandatory  attendance  policies  and  let  the 
students  earn  their  grades  on  the  basis  of  academic 
achievement. 

If  the  professors  who  have  these  policies  will  not 
change  them,  the  next  best  thing  would  be  to  have 
a  campus  wide  policy  on  attendance  so  students 
would  know  what  was  expected  of  them  and  also 
know  the  rules  would  not  change  on  them  every 
time  they  changed  classrooms.

Challenge  issued  to  faculty 


LISA  LANDIS 
News  Editor 

I  have  seen  them  dress  up  like 
past  figures  of  history  and  I  have 
seen  them  jumping  up  and 
down  tables. 

What  a  peculiar  species! 

I  am  referring  to  teachers  I  have 
seen  on  television  and  have 
heard  about  from  friends. 

A  few  years  ago  I  watched  a 
segment  on  "60  Minutes"  about 
a  world  history  teacher  who  re¬ 
lied  on  his  creativity  to  teach  his 
class.  For  every  new  segment  in 
the  history  text  he  would  come 
into  class  dressed  as  a  famous 
person  such  as  George  Washing¬ 
ton,  Alexander  the  Great  and 
Christopher  Columbus. 

As  I  watched  this  I  asked  my¬ 
self  why  this  man  put  himself 
through  this.  What  motivated 
him  to  enter  his  classroom  speak¬ 
ing  Latin?  Why  was  this  so  im-r 
portant  to  him? 

I  guess  that  is  why  "60 
Minutes"  was  there. 

That  must  have  meant  that  it  is 


highly  unusual  for  a  teacher  to 
teach  the  class  beyond  the  status 
quo. 

That  must  have  meant  he 
cared. 

This  teacher  must  have  real¬ 
ized  how  hard  it  is  to  keep  a  stu¬ 
dent's  attention  at  all,  let  alone 
for  50  minutes  and  he  must  have 
thought  what  he  had  to  teach 
was  important  enough  to  keep 
the  students  awake. 

So  he  compromised  his  pride 
a  bit.  The  first  time  he  costumed 
himself  and  was  walking  down 
the  hallway,  I  am  sure  the  other 
faculty  members  gave  him  curi¬ 
ous  looks  and  maybe  even 
laughed. 

But  then  so  did  the  students. 

The  students  laughed  and  en¬ 
joyed  themselves  and  looked  for¬ 
ward  to  going  to  class.  They 
learned  about  world  history. 

Admittedly,  this  teacher  taught 
high  school  so  maybe  comparing 
high  school  to  college  is  like  com¬ 
paring  apples  and  oranges  but  I 
thought  learning  was  learning  no 


matter  where  the  process  takes 
place. 

But  unfortunately,  I  have  yet  to 
see  this  enthusiasm  for  myself. 
And  I  know  what  some  of  the 
faculty  are  thinking  now:  "Who 
is  this  person  to  be  criticizing  us- 
she  does  not  know  the  work  we 
go  through  now."  Or  "there  is  no 
way  I  am  dressing  up  like  an 
idiot." 

This  is  not  criticism  but  rather 
suggestion. 

I,  the  student,  have  to  sit  in 
your  class  and  read  chapters  of 
your  texts  and  maybe  I  do  not 
care  about  what  I  am  reading  be¬ 
cause  maybe  I  see  you  do  not 
care. 

Maybe  some  of  the  faculty  do 
not  realize  the  power  they  have. 
Students  who  are  here  to  learn 
and  care  about  what  they  are 
learning  put  their  complete  trust 
in  what  the  instructor  says. 

They  rely  on  your  experience 
and  will  try  to  follow  your  ad¬ 
vice.  Why  not  make  the  most  of 
this  power  I  see  and  talk  to  too 


many  teachers  who  are  just  try¬ 
ing  to  get  through  the  text  and 
who  are  just  trying  to  get 
through  the  day. 

I  am  not  asking  to  see  the 
faculty  comparing  costumes  or 
acting  like  morons  but  I  am  issu¬ 
ing  a  "Faculty  Creativity 
Challenge." 

I  am  also  asking  the  students 
to  cooperate.  If  your  instructor 
does  something  out  of  the  ordi¬ 
nary  to  get  the  point  accross  do 
not  be  a  jerk  and  ridicule  them. 
Instead,  enjoy  it  and  appreciate 
their  efforts.  It  means  they  care. 

I  bet  most  of  you  have  already 
quit  reading  because  you  are 
turned  off  by  what  I  am  saying. 
Did  this  hit  too  hard?  I  hope  so. 

Do  you  care  about  what  you 
teach?  What  made  you  want  to 
teach  in  the  first  place?  It  cannot 
be  the  money. 

So  you,  the  faculty,  tell  me,  or 
better  yet,  show  me,  show  us, 
the  students,  why  you  care,  why 
we  should  care. 


Stroller  recalls  first  campus  tour 


Lately  Your  Man  has  been 
noticing  a  lot  of  people  on  cam¬ 
pus  who  seem  to  look  a  little  out 
of  place.  No,  it  is  not  Campus 
Safety  officers,  trying  to  find  the 
doughnut  shop,  although  that  is 
a  fair  guess. 

Instead  it  appears  to  be  tour 
groups  of  perspective  students 
and  their  parents  who  have  be¬ 
gun  their  annual  tromp  through 
our  hallowed  grounds. 

Seeing  all  these  new  people 
has  caused  Your  Hero,  in  an  un¬ 
usual  moment  of  nostalgia,  to 
remember  the  tour  he  took  when 
only  a  high  school  senior. 

Of  course,  things  have 
changed  a  little  since  then,  but  it 
is  Your  Man's  opinion  that  many 
of  the  same  experiences  he  had 
are  still  part  of  the  Northwest 
tour  as  we  know  it  today. 

Only  moments  after  getting  to 
campus.  Your  Hero  was  lost.  It  is 
hard  to  believe  now  that  anyone 
could  get  lost  on  this  campus, 
although  there  have  been  sever¬ 
al  young  ladies  over  the  years 
who  have  felt  that  Your  Man 
should  make  the  effort  to  do  so. 


After  wandering  for  almost  an 
hour,  Your  Man  remembered 
that  he  had  a  map  of  the  campus. 
Unfortunately,  whoever  drew  the 
map  was  apparently  not  a  quali¬ 
fied  cartographer. 


This  particular  map  of  North¬ 
west's  campus  looked  well  or¬ 
dered,  straight  with  the  world 
and  even  had  the  buildings  num¬ 
bered  with  a  convenient  key  at 
the  bottom  stating  which  build¬ 
ings  each  number  represented. 

However,  the  mapmaker  had 
overlooked  a  couple  of  important 
points. 

In  the  first  place,  there  were  no 
numbers  on  the  actual  buildings. 
To  make  matters  worse,  the  map 
supplied  only  the  shapes  of  each 
building's  roof  so  no  one  but  Bat¬ 
man  could  have  recognized 
them. 

Your  Hero  walked  into  one 


large  building  and  asked  for 
directions  to  the  admissions 
office  When  they  said  it  was  on 
the  second  floor  Your  Man 
remarked  that  it  was  odd  to  put 
such  an  office  in  the  gymnasium. 

Once  he  met  the  bubbly, 
blonde  student  ambassador,  Your 
Crusader  felt  a  littlemore  at  ease. 
She  took  him  around  campus, 
showing  him  the  dorm  rooms  in 
the  Library,  basketball  courts  in 
the  Fine  Arts  building  and  the  Bi¬ 
ology  department's  radio  station. 

As  the  tour  progressed  it  be¬ 
came  evident  to  Your  Man  that 
this  energetic  tour  guide 
genuinely  enjoyed  her  job,  even 
though  she  was  not  exactly  sure 
what  it  was  or  how  to  go  about 
accomplishing  it. 

She  talked  freely  to  Your  Man, 
asking  him  questions  such  as, 
"What  are  Your  interests?", 
"What  do  You  plan  to  major  in?" 
and  "Don't  You  think  it  is  a  little 
warm  to  make  Your  Parents  stay 
in  the  car  all  day?" 

One  thing  that  impressed  Your 
Hero  about  Northwest  was  the 
friendly  way  in  which  people 


greeted  him  on  the  sidewalk. 
They  would  all  smile  and  say 
"hi"  and  then  proceeded  to  hit 
on  the  tour  guide. 

Your  Man  decided  to  try  out 
his  romantic  diplomacy  on  the 
student  ambassador  but,  alas, 
was  just  as  unsuccessful  as  the 
others.  , 

When  the  busy  day  was  over 
Your  Man  decided  that  North- . 
west  was  the  place  for  him.  What 
exactly  led  to  this  demented  de¬ 
cision  is  still  unclear. 

Maybe  it  was  the  freindly  peo¬ 
ple  or  the  scenic  campus.  Or  it 
could  have  been  the  academic  ex¬ 
cellence  that  seemed  to  pervade 
from  all  aspects  of  the  Universi¬ 
ty 

But  in  the  final  analysis  what 
probably  convinced  Your  Hero  to 
go  to  Northwest  was  the  fact  that 
it  was  cheaper  than  any  other 
University  in  the  four  state  region 
and  besides,  it  was  the  only 
school  that  would  take  someone 
with  a  .05  grade  point  average. 

So  much  for  academic 
excellence.

Students  part  of  select  cast 


JENNIFER  DUNLOP 
Staff  Writer 

"Up  With  People"  is  a  select 
group  with  only  600  of  the  over 
9,000  students  auditioning  mak¬ 
ing  the  cast.  Northwest,  however, 
is  lucky  enough  to  have  two  of  its 
students  involved,  senior  Sarah 
Frerking  and  junior  Jennifer  Gal¬ 
lop,  who  will  both  join  the  group 
in  July  1991. 

"Up  With  People"  is  an  inter¬ 
national  group  which  tours  the 
United  States  and  other  coun¬ 
tries  and  is,  "geared  to  promote 
cultural  awareness  and  under¬ 
standing,"  according  to  Frerking. 

Cast  members  sing  and  dance 
at  set  performances,  such  as  the 
Olympics  or  the  Superbowl  and 
are  also  involved  in  community 
projects  like  visiting  schools, 
nursing  homes  and  prisons. 

Frerking,  from  Waverly,  Mo.,  is 
a  public  relations  major  and  is 
also  involved  with  Sigma  Socie¬ 
ty,  the  Missourian,  the  Tower 
yearbook  and  is  the  head  resi¬ 
dent  assistant  of  Millikan  Hall. 
She  first  became  aware  of  the 
"Up  With  People"  program 
through  a  friend  who  is  current¬ 
ly  touring  with  the  group.  Frerk¬ 
ing  also  helped  with  the  public 
relations  for  the  group  when 
they  performed  in  Maryville  last 
September. 

Gallop,  a  personnel  manage¬ 
ment  major,  from  Kansas  City, 
Mo.,  is  a  member  of  the  Phi  Mu 
Sorority,  the  Wesley  Student 
Foundation  and  the  KIDS  big 
brother/sister  organization.  She 
also  learned  of  Up  With  People 
from  a  friend,  who  was  involved 
in  the  group  in  1988. 

Both  Frerking  and  Gallop  au¬ 
ditioned  for  "Up  With  People"  af¬ 


ter  the  group's  performance  here 
last  fall.  Auditions  were  not  like 
they  expected.  "It's  really  kind  of 
different,"  Frerking  said.  "You'd 
think  that  you'd  have  to  sing  and 
dance,  but  the  application  is 
geared  towards  past  music  ex¬ 
perience.  A  lot  of  it  is  personali¬ 
ty,  how  people-oriented  you  are." 

Auditions  consisted  of  two 
hour  interviews,  Gallop  said. 
"They  didn't  want  people  who 
weren't  aware  of  current  issues." 

Almost  two  months  later,  the 
women  were  informed  they  had 
made  the  cast. 

"I  remember  I  knew  if  I  didn't 
get  it.  I'd  have  just  a  little  white 
envelope  saying.  Thanks  for  try¬ 
ing,'  but  if  I  would  get  it,  there 
would  be  a  big  packet  with  infor¬ 
mation,"  Frerking  said.  "One  day 
I  went  to  our  rftailbox  and  there 
was  the  big  brown  envelope." 

Gallop  was  also  surprised 
when  she  received  the  T>ig  enve¬ 
lope.' 

"I  hadn't  gotten  my  hopes  up," 
Gallop  said.  "You  know,  there 
are  8,000  plus  students  trying  out 
for  this  and  you  might  be  good 
but  there  are  a  lot  of  other  quali¬ 
fied  people,  too,  so  I  was  just 
happy  that  I  tried  out  and  I  was 
ecstatic  when  I  got  it." 

Frerking  and  Gallop  will  both 
leave  for  Tuscon,  Az.,  in  July, 
1991,  where  they  will  practice 
with  the  entire  crew  for  one 
month  before  actually  going  on 
tour. 

While  on  tour,  the  women  will 
be  assuming  a  variety  of  respon¬ 
sibilities. 

"It's  kind  of  neat  how  they  do 
this,"  Frerking  said.  "During  the 
show,  you  sing  or  dance,  usual¬ 
ly  everyone  does  that,  but  then

It  doesn't  take  long  to  figure  it 
out.  Movies  aren't  the  inexpen¬ 
sive  entertainment  they  used  to 
be.  What  happened  to  the  good 
'ole  days  when  five  bucks  got  you 
a  movie,  popcorn  and  a  coke? 

Movies  themselves  cost  five 
bucks,  and  forget  treating  some¬ 
one  else  to  a  flick.  There  is  the 
dollar  theater,  but  the  films  were 
released  years  ago.  The  solution 
is  to  ban  the  institution  al¬ 
together.

entertainment  group  "Up  With  People"  in  July  1991. 


you  rotate.  You'll  sell  programs  or 
beforehand  you'll  take  tickets. 
You  can  tell  they've  got  it  all 
planned  out  so  everybody  shares 
in  the  duties." 

"I  guess  you  literally  do  live  out 
of  a  suitcase  for  a  whole  year," 
Frerking  said.  The  women  have 
not  received  a  set  itinerary,  but 
both  are  fairly  sure  they'll  visit 
Russia. 

"I  hope  we  go  to  Australia  or 
New  Zealand  because  those  are 
my  two  favorite  places  in  the 
world  to  go.  I  doubt  we'll  be  go¬ 
ing  into  Africa  or  South  Ameri¬ 
ca  because  I  think  right  now  it's 
just  too  hostile  for  this  kind  of 
group,"  Gallop  said. 

Although  one  might  expect  to 
be  paid  for  this  kind  of  project, 
just  the  opposite  is  true.  Cast 
members  pay  the  group  $10,000 


to  participate  for  one  year.  The 
money  is  used  to  pay  for  the 
meals  and  lodging. 

Gallop  says  she  will  start  rais¬ 
ing  the  money  by  filling  her  pig¬ 
gy  bank  and  then  holding  other 
fundraisers  and,  as  a  last  resort, 
take  out  a  student  loan.  Frerking, 
on  the  other  hand,  hopes  to 
work  on  a  cruise  ship,  to  avoid 
rent,  groceries  and  gas  for  her 
car. 

An  opportunity  like  touring 
with  "Up  With  People"  doubt¬ 
lessly  offers  many  advantages, 
but  what  Gallop  is  most  looking 
forward  to  is  the  traveling. 

"You  think  you've  seen  it  all," 
Gallop  said,  "but  the  world  is 
such  a  huge  place  and  there's  so 
much  to  see.  I'm  really  looking 
forward  to  traveling  and  being 
exposed  to  different  cultures."

Video  rentals  to  the  rescue! 
Movies  are  released  on  tape 
faster  and  faster,  sometimes 
while  the  movie  is  still  hanging 
around  those  dollar  joints. 

A  group  of  people  can  rent  two 
or  three  great  new  releases  for 
what  it  costs  for  one  price  of  ad¬ 
mission.  While  this  does  sound 
a  little  money  conscious,  think  of 
all  the  fun  being  in  the  privacy  of 
your  own  home  can  provide. 

The  following  list,  in  no  partic¬ 
ular  order,  are  some  fun  new 
releases  worth  staying  home  for. 

When  Harry  Met  Sally-When 
Harry  met  Sally,  they  got  on  each 
other's  nerves.  Of  course,  they 
were  two  strangers  driving  cross 
country  on  break  from  college. 
Ten  years  later,  when  Harry  met 
Sally,  via  bumping  into  her  on 
the  street,  they  became  friends. 
They  share  everything  together 
and  become  such  good  friends, 


they  couldn't  imagine  being 
lovers.  But  it  just  happens.  This 
romantic  comedy  about  being  in 
love  with  your  best  friend  is 
directed  by  Rob  Reiner("The 
Princess  Bride"  and  "The  Sure 
Thing").  Meg  Ryan  and  Billy 
Crystal  star. 

Weekend  At  Bernie's-  Andrew 
McCarthy("Pretty  in  Pink")  and 
Jonathan  Silverman  play  two 
computer  programmers  who  un¬ 
cover  embezzlement  in  the  com¬ 
pany  books.  As  reward,  their 
boss,  Bemie  (Terry  Kiser),  invites 
them  up  for  a  wild  weekend  at 
his  beach  home.  But  Bemie  is  be¬ 
hind  the  heist,  and  he  is  dead 
when  they  get  there!  The  stage  is 
set  for  this  hilarious  run  from  the 
bad  guys.  Scenes  are  filled  with 
beach,  bodies  and  parties  with  a 
twist.  The  two  bring  Bemie  along 
for  the  fun.  The  stunt  work  is 
amazing  and  the  jokes  make  you 
laugh  out  loud. 

Who  Framed  Roger  Rabbit-  Fa¬ 
mous  "Toon"  actor  Roger  Rabbit 
is  being  framed,  he's  having  mar¬ 
ital  problems  with  wife  Jessica 
and  someone's  trying  to  kill  him. 
Eddie,  the  human  detective,  is  on 
the  case.  Eddie's  always  hated 
"Toons,"  but  who  can  resist  the 
charm  and  wit  of  Roger  Rabbit. 
Steven  Spielberg  and  Robert 
Zemekis  bring  this  fantasy  to  life, 
while  achieving  a  landmark  in 
cinema  history.  "Roger  Rabbit" 
won  four  Acamedy  Awards,  in-, 
eluding  the  1988  Special  Achieve¬ 
ment  Award.  To  the  audience, 
the  story  is  just  plain  fun,  with 
cute  characters  and  a  suspense¬ 
ful  story  that  makes  you  cheer  at 
the  end.

Slow  start  sinks  'Kittens 


February  1 ,  1990 


SUSAN  CAMPBELL 
Copy  Editor 

The  Washburn  Lady  Blues  shot 
over  63  percent  from  the  court  to 
hand  the  Bearkitten's  an  82-73 
loss  in  Lamkin  Gym  Wednesday 
night. 

The  loss  drops  the  'Kittens 
conference  record  to  5-3.  The 
'Kittens  opened  the  contest  with 
10  unanswered  points.  ■ 

The  'Kittens  pulled  within  one 
point  by  halftime,  but  trailed  the 
Lady  Blues  during  the  remainder 
of  the  game. 

The  Bearkitten  basketball  team 
fell  to  the  eighth-ranked  Central 
Missouri  State  University  Jennies 
79-45  Saturday  in  Warrensburg. 

The  Jennies  held  the  Bearkit- 
tens  to  16  points  in  the  second 
half  and  a  season-low  45  points 
in  the  conference  contest. 

Saturday's  loss  dropped  the 
Bearkittens  one  game  out  in  the 
MIAA,  leaving  Northwest  with  a 
13-5  overall  record  and  a  5-2  con¬ 
ference  record. 

Despite  suffering  their  second 
conference  loss,  women's  coach 
Wayne  Winstead  remains  op¬ 


timistic  about  the  Bearkittens' 
chances  for  doing  well  in  post¬ 
season  play. 

"With  the  parity  in  our  confer¬ 
ence,  anything  can  happen,"  he 
said.  The  percent  leans  in  favor 
of  Central  (finishing  in  first),  but 
anything  can  happen.. 

"We  are  playing  well  and 
should  make  the  playoffs,  but  as 
far  as  first  place  in  the  confer¬ 
ence,  we'll  just  have  to  wait  and 
see,"  he  said. 

The  'Kittens  were  ready  for  the 
first  half  of  play  taking  a  10-4  lead 
during  the  first  five  minutes. 

Northwest  maintained  an 
upper-hand  over  the  Jennies 
throughout  most  of  the  half, 
with  the  lead  ending  shortly  af¬ 
ter  Danae  Wagner/s  charity  shot 
with  4:04  left  on  the  clock  which 
brought  the  score  to  27-24. 

Northwest  then  suffered  a 
seven-point  run  by  the  Jennies. 
After  two  more  foul  shots  from 
Wagner,  the  score  at  the  halftime 
buzzer  was  49-31. 

The  second  half  was  a  different 
story  as  the  Jennies  dominated

'Cats  lose  fourth  straight 


GENE  MORRIS 
Sports  Editor 

The  Bearcat  basketball  team 
lost  its  fourth  conference  game 
59-54  at  the  hands  of  Washburn 
Wednesday  night  in  Lamkin 
Gym. 

Washburn's  defense  held  the 
'Cats  shooting  to  36  percent  from 
the  filed  and  under  20  percent 
from  the  three-point  range. 

The  'Cats  matched  Washburn 
evenly  during  the  first  half  for  a 
21-21  score.  Washbrun  sank  over 
66  percent  of  their  shots  in  the  se¬ 
cond  half  for  the  win. 

The  sixth-ranked  Central  Mis¬ 
souri  State  Mules  handed  the 
Bearcat  basketball  team  its  third 
straight  conference  loss  with  a 


73-60  victory  Saturday  night. 

The  loss  dropped  the  'Cats 
overall  record  to  11-6  while  its 
conference  mark  fell  to  2-4.  The 
Mules  increased  their  overall 
mark  to  17-0  while  their  confer¬ 
ence  mark  improved  to  6-0. 

With  7:15  remaining  in  the  first 
half  of  Saturday  night's  game, 
Kurds  Downing  gave  the  'Cats  a 
20-15  lead.  During  the  final  six 
minutes  of  the  half,  however,  the 
Mules  took  center  stage,  bounc¬ 
ing  back  with  14  unanswered 
points  to  capture  a  29-22  halftime 
lead. 

The  'Cats  pulled  within  six 
points  during  the  second  half, 
but  were  not  able  to  capitalize  on 
the  Mules'  16  turnovers  in  the 


contest. 

The  Mules  led  by  as  many  as 
15  points  during  the  second  half, 
coasting  to  a  13-point  victory  over 
the  'Cats. 

Bearcat  coach  Steve  Tappmey- 
er  handled  the  final  seven 
minutes  of  the  first  half  the  same 
way  he  has  the  entire  season. 

"You  just  keep  preaching  the 
same  things  you  have  all  year," 
Tappmeyer  said.  "You  don't  like 
to  lose  all  your  time  outs  to 
square  things  away. 

"We  need  to  make  some  ad¬ 
justments  and  get  the  ball  inside 
more,"  he  said.  "We  also  need  to 
get  back  into  the  groove  defen¬ 
sively.  We're  not  going  to  make 
any  huge  changes  though." 


Defensively  the  Mules  held  the 
'Cats  in  check  most  of  the  con¬ 
test.  The  'Cats  shot  35  percent 
from  the  field,  which  is  almost  13 
percent  less  than  their  season 
average.  The  'Gats  were  also  out- 
rebounded  41-32. 

The  Mules'  offense  was  guid¬ 
ed  by  Armando  Becker  who  had 
20  points  and  12  rebounds  in  the 
contest.  Guard  Sonny  Randle  ad¬ 
ded  13  points. 

Offensively  the  Cats  were  led 
by  Bo  Fitts,  Chris  Barker  and 
Benji  Burke  who  combined  for  31 
of  the  team's  60  points. 

The  Bearcats  travel  to  Jefferson 
City  for  a  conference  contest  with 
Lincoln  University  Saturday 
night.  '

Comparisons  to  the  1978 
Pittsburg  Steelers  arose  when 
the  San  Fransico  49ers  won 
their  fourth  Super  Bowl. 

The  Steelers  won  the  Super 
Bowl  four  times  with  Terry 
Bradshaw  at  quarterback.  They 
are  the  only  team  in  the  Nation¬ 
al  Football  League  to  have  back- 
to-back  Super  Bowl  victories  on 
two  separate  occasions. 

The  49ers  have  dominated 
most  of  the  past  decade  with 
Joe  Montana  at  quarterback. 
They  have  not  only  won  the 
Super  Bowl  four  times,  but 
have  also,  for  the  most  part, 
dominated  the  action. 

While  it  is  hard  to  say  which 
team  is  better,  I  tend  to  agree 
with  most  of  the  people  in 
Pittsburg  and  say  the  Steelers 
of  the  70s  would  be  more  than 
a  match  for  the  49ers  of  the 
'80s. 

The  49ers  would  have  an 
edge  at  quarterback  with  Joe 
Montana,  but  he  is  probably 
glad  he  has  never  seen  the  likes 
of  the  "Steel  Curtain"  that  put 
fear  into  every  quarterback  dur¬ 
ing  the  70s. 

The  49ers  have  had  to  rebuild 
their  team  during  the  decade 
while  the  Steelers  dominated 
their  time  with  the  same  group 
of  guys.  They  figured  "if  it  is 
not  broken,  do  not  fix  it." 


The  Steelers'  offense  com¬ 
plemented  Bradshaw  with  the 
ground  attack  of  Franco  Harris 
and  Rockey  Blier  in  the  back- 
field.  -The  air  attack  of  Lynn 
Swann  and  John  Stallworth 
was  also  second  to  none. 

The  Steelers'  defense  was 
one  of  the  best  units  ever  as¬ 
sembled,  if  not  the  best.  Names 
like  L.C.  Greenwood,  Jack 
Lambert,  Jack  Hamm  arid  of 
course  "Mean"  Joe  Greene  put 
fear  into  the  heart  of  every 
quarterback. 

What  would  really  happen  if 
these  two  teams  ever  played 
each  other?  Each  dominated 
their  decade,  but  which  would 
have  what  it  takes  to  be  the  best 
in  the.  ultimate  challenge 
against  each  other? 

XOR  Corp.  of  Minneapolis, 
makers  of  the  computerized 
NFL  "Dream  Season,"  matched 
the  1978  Steelers  against  the 
current  49ers  in  a  copyrighted 
computer  simulated  game  for 
the  Associated  Press. 

The  49ers  led  the  Steelers  by 
a  field  goal  at  the  half,  but 
Bradshaw  brought  the  Steelers 
back  as  they  managed  a  26-23 
victory. 

I  know  it  was  not  much  of  a 
game.  It  was  a  computer  play¬ 
ing  percentages  and  probabili¬ 
ties  that  would  add  up  to  next 
to  nothing  in  a  game  of  such 
magnitude. 

One  thing  is  for  sure  though. 
The  49ers  would  not  see  a 
blowout  unless  they  were  the 
ones  on  the  lower  end  of  a  lop¬ 
sided  score. 


Four  'Cats  place  first*  in  meet 


JEFF  HEEREN 
Contributing  Writer 

The  Bearcat  track  and  field 
team  had  four  first  place  finish¬ 
es  while  the  Bearkittens  had  two 
second  place  and  three  third 
place  finishes  at  Saturday's  in¬ 
vitational  track  meet  in  South 
Dakota. 

Bearcat  distance  runner  Jason 
White  ran  a  15:06.53  in  the  5,000 
meter  run,  winning  the  event  by 
more  than  20  seconds  over  the 
second  place  finisher. 

Along  with  White,  other  first 
place  finishers  included  Renwick 
Bovell,  55  meter  hurdles  —  (7.59); 
Ken  Onuaguluchi,  shot  put  — 
(49-9);  and  the  Northwest  4x100 


meter  relay  team  —  (43.78). 

"Jason  White  ran  away  from 
the  field  and  had  a  pretty  good 
race,"  noted  distance  coach 
Micheal  Robins.  "His  times  could 
and  will  be  better  when  he  has 
someone  to  run  with  at  his  pace, 
and  he  (White)  hasn't  had  that 
yet." 

Although  this  meet  was  a  non¬ 
scoring  track  meet,  the  team  as 
a  whole  was  competitive  with 
nine  finishes  in  the  top  four 
places. 

"Jason  Agee  ran  exceptionally 
well  on  our  relay  teams,"  said 
Tom  Lester,  the  'Cats  sprint 
coach.  "He  ran  the  first  leg  in  all 
four  of  our  relays,  had  us  in  the 


lead  in  three  of  them  and  an 
arms-length  away  in  the  fourth." 

Jennifer  Holdiman  turned  in  a 
personal  best  for  the  Bearkittens, 
with  a  shot  put  mark  of  41-4  3/4, 
giving  her  a  second  place  finish. 

Kim  O'Riley  anchored  two 
Northwest  relay  teams,  the  dis¬ 
tance  medley  (13:17.38)  and  4x800 
relay,  and  led  them  to  second 
place  finishes. 

Other  high  finishers  for  the 
Bearkittens  were  :  Angela  Zaner, 
400m/  (69.38);  O^Riley,  3,000m, 
(11:10.29);  and  the  Northwest 
4x100m  relay  —  (54.2). 

"I  think'  the  kids  had  a  lot  of 
fun,"  coach  Richard  Alsup  said. 
"It  gave  them  a  chance  to  see 


where  the  nationals  are  going  to 
be  held  this  year." 

Correction 

In  last  week's  issue  the  Missou¬ 
rian  reported  a  bench  technical 
was  issued  to  the  Bearcats  dur¬ 
ing  their  game  against  Missouri 
Western.  No  bench  technical  was 
issued  in  the  contest.  The  Mis¬ 
sourian  regrets  the  error.

Campus  celebrates  Black  History  Month 


USA  LANDIS 
News  Editor 

Today  starts  an  event  that  is 
very  important  to  many  of  the 
students  on  this  campus--it  be¬ 
gins  Black  History  Month. 

In  support  of  the  celebration  of 
this  month  the  Alliance  of  Black 
Collegians,  Alpha  Phi  Alpha,  the 
Theatre  Department,  the  Art 
Department  and  Campus  Activi¬ 
ty  Planners  will  be  sponsoring  a 
series  of  activities  for  the  whole 
campus. 

The  Joseph  Holmes  Dance 
Troop  will  be  at  the  Mary  Linn 
Performing  Arts  Center  Feb.  6  at 
8  p.m.  They  ctre  a  multi-racial 
dance  company  that  has  incorpo¬ 
rated  modern,  ballet  and  jazz 
dance  into  their  own  style  of 
dance.  The  Chicago-based  group

the  action  and  outscored  North¬ 
west  13-0  in  the  first  five  minutes. 

The  Jennies  led  the  Bearkittens 
by  no  less  than  20  points  during 
the  final  nine  minutes  of  the 
game. 

Winstead  said  he  believed  that 
two  things  in  particular  hap¬ 
pened  in  the  second  half  that 
changed  the  flow  of  the  game  for 
Northwest. 

"First,  Central  came  back  with 
more  intensity  and  we  didn't 
meet  it,"  he  said.  "We  didn't  es¬ 
tablish  our  momentum.  Second, 
the  game  was  allowed  to  be  more 
physical,  and  we  didn't  meet  the 
physical  play  of  the  game  either." 

Leading  Bearkitten  scorers 
were  Wagner  and  Sandy  Nelson 
with  14  points  each,  and  top  re¬ 
bounder  for  the  night  was  Col¬ 
leen  Yost  with  six. 

"I  think  Sandy  Nelson  and 
Danae  Wagner  did  a  good  job  in 
the  game,"  Winstead  said.  "They

According  to  Dr.  Renner,  vice 
president  for  business  affairs  at

On  Feb.  14,  Conrad  Muham¬ 
mad  will  deliver  a  lecture  in  the 
University  Room  located  in  the 
J.W.  Jones  Student  Union  at  7 
p.m. 

Muhammad  is  the  president  of 
the  Black  Student  League  at  the 
University  of  Pennsylvania.  He 
organized  the  first  Black  Student 
Unity  Conference  in  1986,  which 


played  what  I  call  'hard-nosed' 
basketball." 

Bearkitten  scorers  rounding 
out  the  group  were  Chris  Swan¬ 
son,  nine  points;  Yost,  three 
points;  Stacy  Rockhold,  four 
points;  and  Amy  Rold,  one 
point. 

Freshman  Kristi  Lawson  was 
the  high  scorer  for  the  Jennies, 
going  9-for-10  from  the  field  for 
18  points.  The  Jennies'  leading 
rebounder  was  Robin  Williams 
with  11. 

Wagner's  and  Swanson's  per¬ 
formances  both  added  to  their 
team-high  positions  in  two  areas: 
Wagner  with  293  season  points 
and  16.3  per  game,  and  Swanson 
with  139  rebounds  and  8.2  per 
game. 

The  Bearkittens  play  Lincoln

City.  Probable  starters  in  the 
game  will  be  sophomores  Wagn¬ 
er  and  Kenkel,  juniors  Swanson 
and  Yost,  and  senior  Nelson.

Parking - 

"There  are  escort  hours,"  McAl- 
pin  added,  "but  if  residents  are 
unable  to  get  to  a  phone  before 
driving  to  school,  or  if  they  are 
coming  from  home,  they  are  not 
able  to  utilize  this  service  and 
sometimes  have  to  walk  alone,  in 
the  dark,  from  the  west  parking 
lot  to  their  rooms." 

Another  concern  McAlpin  cit¬ 
ed  was  the  steep  hill  west  of 
South  Complex  which  becomes 
hazardous  to  climb  when  icy  or 
muddy. 

Other  groups  on  campus  pro¬

tor  and  installation  artist  who 
also  works  with  drawing  and 
printmaking.  He  achieved  recog¬ 
nition  in  the  early  years  of  the 
civil  rights  movement  for  his 
"Lynch  Fragment  Series"  of 


four-day  week  will  be  Monday 
through  Thursday  for  adminis¬ 
tration,  academic  support  offices' 
and  summer  classes.  Classes  will 
begin  on  Thursday,  June  7.  The 
Board  also  approved  the  summer

1990-91.  Registration  for  the 
Summer  1990-91  school  schedule

practitioner  from  Family 
Guidance  Center,  Maryville,  for 
providing  medical  services  for 
students  at  the  Student  Health 
Center.  The  four  physicians  are 
Drs.  Jane  and  Pat  Dawson,  M.D.; 
Dr.  Kanti  Havaldar,  M.D.;  and 
Dr.  M.W.  Runez,  M.D.  Each  of 
.  the  physicians  will  staff  the 
health  center  during  specified 
hours. 


Committee. 

McAlpin  offered  several  sug¬ 
gestions  for  compromise. 

"We  suggest  designating  two 
rows  of  seven-day,  24-hour  park¬ 
ing  for  faculty  and  food  service 
personnel  and  two  rows  for  stu¬ 
dent  use  on  evenings  and 
weekends,"  McAlpip  said. 

'7  She  added  that  , during  even¬ 
ings  and  weekends  most  of  the 
cars  in  parking  lot  two  belong  to 
food  service  personnel. 

"Food  service  employees 
would  also  be  able  to  ask  a  Cam¬ 
pus  Safety  officer  to  escort  them 
to  the  Administration  Building's 
parking  lot,"  McAlpin  said. 


welded  steel  wall  pieces. 

The  last  event  for  Black  Histo¬ 
ry  Month  will  include  a  perfor¬ 
mance  on  Feb.  27  by  Phillip  Jen¬ 
nings.  The  magician/illusionist 
will  perform  at  7  p.m.  in  the  Un¬ 
ion  Ballroom. 

Bill  Cowan,  public  relations 
officer  for  ABC,  said  he  hopes  to 
get  the  word  out  to  everyone 
about  Black  History  Month. 

"I  want  to  focus  on  this  and  go 
all  out  to  everybody  about  Black 
History  Month,"  Cowan  said.  "I 
want  to  resolve  the  problems 
people  have  had  with  ABC  and 
work  together.  If  we  all  can  work 
together,  the  system  will  work  for 
everyone." 

Cowan  has  been  working  on 
making  sure  the  campus  is  aware 
of  Black  History  Month  and  that 
it  is  not  just  for  black  students. 


"1  want  the  campus  to  under¬ 
stand  that  ABC  is  here  for 
whoever,  not  just  black  students. 
The  only  way  we  can  get  rid  of 
prejudice  which  is  a  result  of  ig¬ 
norance,  is  through  education. 
One  way  I  think  we  could  accom¬ 
plish  this  is  for  the  University  to 
offer  a  black  history  course.  We 
also  need  black  instructors  on 
this  campus,"  Cowan  said. 

Darleen  Vyright,  ABC  member, 
said  "when  there  are  people  who 
have  never  lived  in  an  environ¬ 
ment  where  there  are  other  races 
besides  whites,  there  will  always 
be  some  misunderstandings 
about  what  and  who  black  peo¬ 
ple  are." 

Wright  said  she  hopes  enough 
people  will  come  to  the  Black 
History  Month  events  and  start 
coming  to  ABC  meetings'. 


Battalion  receives 
satisfactory  letter 


LAURA  PIERSON 
Staff  Writer 

The  Northwest  Missouri  State 
University  ROTC  battalion  re- 
"cently  received  a  good  report 
from  their  commanding  officer  at 
Fort  Knox,  Kentucky. 

Brigadier  General  Charles  R. 
Hansell,  commanding  officer  of 
the  Army  Reserve  Officer's  Train¬ 
ing  Corp's  Region  II  Cadet  Com¬ 
mand,  issued  the  report  Dec.  15, 
1989  following  the  battalion's  in¬ 
spection  on  Oct.  3,  1989. 

The  Northwest  battalion  is 
commanded  by  Lt.  Col.  Jerry 
Bortner,  professor  of  military 
science. 

In  his  letter  to  University  Presi¬ 
dent  Dean  L.  Hubbard,  Hansell 
wrote,  "I  am  pleased  to  .inform 
you  that  the  inspection  team 
found  the  battalion  operating  in 
an  enthusiastic  and  efficient 
manner.  The  program  is  being  ef¬ 
fectively  managed,  and  the  spirit 
and  commitment  among  the 
cadre  are  uniformly  high." 

According  to  Hansell,  the  in¬ 
spection's  three  main  objectives 
were  to  evaluate  the  efficiency 
and  effectiveness  of  the  battalion 
in  light  of  its  mission,  to  evalu¬ 
ate  the  effect  of  the  guidance  and 
support  being  provided  to  the 
battalion  by  the  Army  ROTC 
Cadet  Command  at  Fort  Knox 
and  to  assess  the  Department  of 
Military  Science  at  Northwest  as 
an  integral,  yet  unique  element 
of  the  university  structure. 


The  inspection  was  command¬ 
ed  by  Col.  Bruce  Maclachlan 
from  Fort  Knox.  He  was  briefed 
by  Lt.  Col.  David  Teachout  and 
Cadet  Major  Larry  Wilson,  both 
of  whom  Bortner  said  did  an  out¬ 
standing  job. 

Twenty-three  areas  are  inspect¬ 
ed  and  they  receive  either  satis¬ 
factory  or  unsatisfactory  marks. 
Bortner  said  each  area  was  rated 
satisfactory.  These  areas  include 
public  affairs,  cadet  training, 
security  and  personnel. 

Special  recognition  for  out¬ 
standing  work  was  given  to  Sgt. 
Augustus  Cortazar  in  charge  of 
supply  and  Capt.  Jeffrey  Knapp 
in  charge  of  marketing  and 
recruiting,  Bortner  said. 

Hansell's  letter  stated  that  the 
team  "was  especially  impressed 
with  the  enthusiasm,  dedication, 
and  quality  of  your  cadets;  they 
are  obviously  proud  of  their  or¬ 
ganization  and  their  university." 

Bortner  said,  "We  tell  the  stu¬ 
dents  they  are  special  and  this 
makes  them  want  to  do  a  little  bit 
more." 

He  feels  the  hands-on  leader¬ 
ship  training  the  cadets  get  also 
adds'"  to  the  enthusiasm  and 
dedicatioh  of ’the  battalion. 

Bortner  said  it  was  the  hard 
work  of  both  the  cadre  and 
cadets  that  was  responsible  for 
the  success  of  the  inspection. 

"It's  the  best  report  we  have 
had  in  the  four  years  since  I  have 
been  here,"  Bortner  said.

catch  us  miss  behaving.
