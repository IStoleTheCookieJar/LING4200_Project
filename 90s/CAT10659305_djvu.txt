Introduction 


Commercial preparations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner 
var. kurstaki (Bt) are aerially applied as part of the Federal/ 
State/County Cooperative Suppression Program to approxi- 
mately 0.2 million Ha (0.5 million acres) per year in the 
eastern United States to suppress potentially defoliating 
populations of the gypsy moth. In the mid 1980's, most 
cooperators standardized operational use of various formula- 
tions to one application of Bt at a dose of 20 to 40 Billion 
International Units (BIU)/Ha (8 to 16 BIU/A) and diluted 
with water at an application rate of 9.35 liters/Ha (1 gal/A). 
Nevertheless, there was developing interest in using undi- 
luted formulations of Bt in an effort to maximize deposit on 
the foliage, extend the area of treatment per aircraft load, and 
minimize costs associated with mixing equipment and sup- 
port personnel. 





The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of 
one dose of Bt applied at three different application rates on: 
(1) preventing defoliation, (2) reducing populations, and (3) 
maximizing deposit on foliage. 


Material and Methods 


Plot Selection. The study area was located near Martinsburg, 
WV. It was composed of a mixed oak stand and infested 
with a building gypsy moth population. Egg mass densities 
were between 1480 and 4940 egg masses/Ha (600 and 2000 
egg masses/A). Twenty-four plots, 20 Ha (50 acre) each, 
were established for treatments and untreated controls. Each 
treatment and control were replicated six times. A random- 
ized complete block design was used, with egg mass density 
as the blocking factor. 


Formulation and Dose. The Dipel 8AF® (Abbott Laborato- 
ries, North Chicago, IL) formulation of Bt was applied at 50 
BIU/Ha (20 BIU/A) using three different application rates: 
undiluted at 2.9 L/Ha (40 fl oz/A), diluted with water at 
9.35 L/Ha (1 gal/A), and at 18.7 L/Ha (2 gal/A). Brilliant 
Sulfaflavine (BSF) (Organic Dyestuffs, East Providence, RI) 
was used as the tracer for deposit assessment. Bond sticker 
(Loveland Industries, Greeley, CO) was added to the formu- 
lations at a 2% (v/v) concentration. 


Application Methods. In an effort to minimize variation 
caused by differing meteorological conditions at the time of 
application, the three application rates were applied simulta- 
neously with three Cessna C-188 AgTrucks, supplied by 
USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Aircraft 
and Equipment Operations, Mission, TX. Also, two nozzling 
Systems were used in an effort to generate similar droplet 
spectra for the three application rates. The application pa- 
rameters for each aircraft are listed in Table 1. Applications 
were made at 15 m (50 ft) above the canopy at a speed of 185 
km/Hr (115 mph) for two aircraft equipped with flat fans 
and at 193 km/Ha (120 mph) for the aircraft equipped with 
micronairs using a 23 m (75 ft) swath width. All of the 
treatments were a single application of Bt with a total of 
three days required to complete all treatments. 


Population Estimation. Gypsy moth egg mass density was 
estimated using the Fixed and Variable Radius Plot method 
(Wilson and Fontaine 1978). Twenty sampling subplot prism 
points were located within the center 4 Ha (10 A) of each 
plot. Egg masses were counted on live overstory trees se- 
lected using a 20 basal area factor wedge prism and within a 
fixed 2.6 m (8.3 ft) radius circle at each prism point. Popula- 
tion changes were estimated by counting all egg masses on 
the ground, debris, and understory trees within the circle in 


January 1988, and again in November 1988. N ew egg masses 
were distinguished from old ones by feel and by color differ- 
ence. 


Egg Mass Quality Determination. Ten randomly selected 
egg masses were collected from each plot in March and 
returned to the laboratory where they were held individually 
at 27°C and 55% RH for at least three weeks to determine 
percent hatch and viability. 


Defoliation Estimation. The 20 subplot prism points used in 
estimating egg mass populations were also used for estimat- 
ing defoliation. Defoliation on all host trees was estimated 
visually in 10% increments seven weeks after Bt application 
within the visible canopy in the immediate area of each 
prism point. The estimates of all points were averaged to 
obtain a single value for each plot. 


Leaf Collection and Tracer Analysis. Two plots of each of 
the three application rates were sampled for deposit analysis, 
one replicate plot on each of the two days of spraying. Trees 
were Selected randomly from 15 of the 20 subplot prism 
points on the first day of sampling and 12 subplot prism 
points on the second day. Tree climbers were used to re- 
move two branches each from the upper and lower canopy. 
Fifteen leaves were then selected from each branch, making a 
total of 30 leaves for each level. Five of these leaves were 
photographed under long wave UV light (ca 420 nm) using 
Fujichrome ISO 100 slide film. The remaining 25 leaves were 
kept at 4°C, their surface areas measured, and analyzed 
through volumetric tracer washoff techniques to measure 
mass recovery. The fluorescent tracer was recovered from 
each leaf by shaking for 25 minutes with 75 ml water. Tracer 
concentrations were measured fluorometrically in the eluants 
using a Turner 112 Fluorometer (Sequoia-Turner Corpora- 
tion, Mountain View, CA). 


Image analysis. An Optomax V image analyzer (ITI, 
Burlington, MA) fitted to a microscope was used to measure 
the sizes of the photographed droplet stains (Yendol et al 
1990, Bryant & Yendol 1991). The spread factor which en- 
ables the image analyzer to convert stain diameters to drop- 
let diameters was determined by measuring the sizes of a 
range of monosized droplets sprayed on adjacent 50% ex- 
panded leaves and petri dishes containing silicone oil, in 
which droplets maintain their spherical shape. 


Image analysis results were expressed in terms of: (1) nl/cm?, 
which represents the volume of deposit (both volatile and 
non-volatile components) per cm? area of leaf; (2) number of 
drops/cm’, droplet density which represents the total num- 
ber of droplets of all sizes impinging on a cm? area of leaf: (3) 
Dyos5, volume median diameter, which represents the drop 
diameter with 50% of the volume above and below that 
value, and (4) (Dy..-D,9,)/Dy9;) droplet spectrum span, a 
non-dimensional index based on the range of droplet sizes 
between the 10 and 90 percentiles divided by the 50 percen- 
tile. 


Volumetric tracer washoff. Although the image analytical 


technique does make accurate estimates of the volume of 
deposit recovered from a spray, it does not measure the mass 
of non-volatile material in the deposit. Therefore, in an effort 
to estimate the active ingredient we assumed that the non- 
volatile tracer was partitioned in a fixed proportion to the 
non-volatile active ingredient. The volumetric technique 
enabled the estimation of active ingredient to be made irre- 
spective of the volume applied. The results of tracer concen- 
tration recovered from the foliage were transformed to 
international units (IU) of activity based on the known con- 
centrations of tracer in samples taken from the nozzles of 
each aircraft upon return to the airport. 


Statistical procedures. Egg mass data were transformed to 


square roots (Vx) for all analyses (Steel and Torrie 1980). 
Treatment effects were analyzed by analysis of variance 
(AOV) and differences between treatment trends were ana- 
lyzed by Tukey’s w-procedure (Steel and Torrie 1960). The 
trend represented the magnitude of change in egg mass 
density and was expressed as the ratio of the post/pre- 
treatment density for each plot. Percentage control (i.e. 
reduction in egg masses/Ha) was calculated by the following 
modification of Abbotts’ formula (1925): percent control = 
100(1-T/C) where T and C are the treatment and control 
trends. 


The parameters of volume per unit area, and droplet density 
were transformed to log base 10 (Yendol et al 1990, Bryant 
and Yendol 1991) for all analyses. Treatment effects for log 
(volume/area), log (droplet density), D,., and droplet span 
were analyzed by AOV, using a split plot design. A pairwise 
t-test comparison was used to test differences between indi- 
vidual treatments. The differences in mean mass deposit 
among treatments were determined by AOV, using a split 
plot design, with sub-plots representing the level of leaves 
within the canopy. The least significant difference (LSD) 
separation procedure was used to test differences between 
treatments. Significance for all analyses was reported at P < 
0.05 level. 


Results 





Population Reduction. Mean pre-treatment egg mass densi- 
ties (Table 2) were significantly different for treatments and 
blocks, both at P < 0.01 as indicated by AOV, using a ran- 
domized complete block design. A significant (F=37.9; 
df=5,23; P<0.01) portion of the variation was removed by 
blocking on pre-treatment egg mass density although the 
mean egg mass density in the 9.35 L/Ha and 18.7 L/Ha plots 


6 


remained different from the control plots. The mean + SD 
percent egg hatch among treatments was 86.9% (+ 10.0) 
(range of 60.8% to 95.4%) indicating a healthy population. 
There was no significant difference in percent egg hatch 
from egg masses collected from either treatment or control 
blocks. The population remained healthy throughout the 
season and increased an average four-fold in the untreated 
control plots (Table 2). 


Differences among egg mass density trends were significant 
(P < 0.01) between treatments and controls but not between 
treatments. The populations in the treated plots fluctuated 
from reductions to increases and the trend averaged a one 
and one-half fold increase. Only 4 of 6 of the undiluted 
treatment plots, 2 of 6 of the 9.35 L/Ha plots and 0 of 6 of the 
18.7 L/Ha plots experienced population reductions. The 
mean percent uncorrected population reduction for the four 
undiluted plots was 47% and for the two 9.35 L/Ha plots 
was 21%. The mean percent control among treatments were 
not significantly different (Table 2). 


Defoliation. Defoliation in blocks treated at all three appli- 
cation rates was significantly less than that observed in the 
control, but not significantly different from each other 
(Table 2). 


Deposit Analysis. The deposits intercepted by the forest 
canopy were analyzed by image analysis to measure droplet 
parameters and through tracer washoff to measure mass 
recovery. 


Image analysis 


Volume/area. The various measured droplet 
spectrum data for the different treatments are shown in 
Table 3. For clarity, the mean volume and mean drops per 


unit area are presented as log transformed and 
untransformed data. A significant difference (P=0.03) in 
spray volume per cm‘ of foliage was detected between the 
18.7 L(T2) and undiluted treatments (TU). The difference 
between the 9.35 L(T1) and undiluted treatments was not 
considered significant (P=0.08). Slightly more deposit was 
recovered in the upper than in the lower level of the canopy, 
3.00 and 2.34 nl/cm7’, respectively. 


Droplet density. There was no significant differ- 
ence in drop density (drops/cm’) between treatments; how- 
ever, differences (P=0.06) were detected at the canopy level 
with 3.2 drops/cm? at the upper level of the canopy com- 
pared with 2.69 drops/cm/ at the lower level. 


Droplet size. There was a significant difference 
(P=0.01) in D,,, between the 9.35 L and undiluted and 
between the 18.7 L/Ha and undiluted treatments. There 
were no significant canopy level effects. 


Droplet spectrum span. A significant treatment 
effect (P=0.02) was found in the mean droplet spectrum span 
_ between the 9.35 L/Ha and undiluted treatment, but the 
difference between the 18.7 L and undiluted was not consid- 
ered significant at P=0.08. These data indicate that the undi- 
luted treatment had a slightly wider droplet spectrum than 
the diluted treatments. There were no significant differences 
detected between different canopy levels among treatments. 


Volumetric tracer washoff. There was no significant 


difference in the mass of active ingredient reaching the forest 
canopy among the 3 treatments nor between the upper and 
lower canopy levels, 54.1 IU/cm? and 46.4 IU/cm? respec- 
tively (Table 4). 


The uniformity of distribution of Bt Spray in the forest 
canopy produced by the three application rates was assessed 
by comparing the standard deviations of the mean log IU/ 
cm’ values calculated among averages for levels between 
trees. The undiluted treatment produced the lowest stan- 
dard deviation, indicating that the variance of samples from 
the mean differed least with this treatment (Table 4). The 
9.35 L/Ha treatment was the least uniformily distributed as 
measured by the standard deviation. 


Discussion 

ae See ereN “Brine EAT ah ona ol Si rhe! 404 oS pists wre 
As expected, the three application rates of Bt provided sig- 
nificant foliage protection. However, the corrected average 
population reduction pooled for all treatments was insuffi- 
cient and residual population density was unacceptably 
high. There were no detectable differences among the treat- 
ments based on mean population trends but out of the total 
six plots where the population reduction trends showed a 
decrease in population, four were from the undiluted and 
two were from the 9.35 L/Ha treatments, none were from the 
18.7 L/Ha treatment. Undiluted application with the 
Micronair AU5000 atomizers generated smaller drops than 
those produced by flat fan nozzles used for the diluted 
applications. The undiluted treatment also produced the 
most homogenous deposit distribution. The volumes recov- 
ered per cm’ of foliage for the two diluted applications did 
not differ significantly from each other but were higher 
(P=0.08) than that recovered from the undiluted treatment. 
Nevertheless, there was little difference in the IU’s of Bt 
delivered to the trees among the three application rates. 


Both volumetric and image analysis data showed that 
slightly more material was deposited on the upper level of 
the forest canopy than in the lower level when estimates 


were made based on drop density rather than drop size, 
which did not vary between the upper and lower canopy for 
any of the treatments. 


In these trials there seems to be only a slight difference 
between the quality of the deposition obtained with the three 
application rates. Any difference in biological effects be- 
tween the treatments would therefore likely be due to active 
ingredient concentration within the drops, and a slightly 
better distribution obtained with the undiluted treatment. A 
better droplet distribution would increase the chances of a 
larva ingesting Bt while feeding. It is not known if a more 
concentrated drop density deposit increases Bt efficacy. 
However, larvae feeding at random on foliage covered with 
concentrated Bt drops would be more likely to ingest a toxic 
dose with a small number of leaf bites than on a widely 
dispersed dilute deposit. 


The results indicate that when Bt is applied at 50 BIU/Ha 
against an increasing gypsy moth population, different 
volumetric application rates do not appear to influence the 
foliage protection effectiveness of the Bt. Therefore, it is 
more cost effective to apply at the undiluted rate than at the 
9.35 L/Ha or 18.7 L/Ha application rates as 3 and 6 times the 
area can be treated per load, respectively. 


Further evaluation of undiluted and diluted application rates 
at higher doses are warranted in an effort to maximize popu- 
lation reduction. These evaluations need to include an as- 
sessment of foliage deposit as well as efficacy. Additionally, 
formulation characteristics (e.g. viscosity, specific gravity) 
and droplet characteristics (e.g. D,,,,) will need to be stan- 
dardized among treatments in an effort to isolate the most 
effective dose and volumetric application rate.
