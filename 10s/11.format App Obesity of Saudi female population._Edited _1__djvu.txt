ABSTRACT 

An  interaction  of  genotype  and  environment  results  in  obesity  which  leads  to  a  complex  multifactorial  chronic 
disease.  Obesity  also  involves  the  integration  of  various  factors  such  as  social,  behavioral,  cultural,  physiological, 
metabolic  and  genetic.  Contributing  to  the  significant  increase  in  morbidity  and  mortality,  a  prevalence  of  obesity  is 
becoming  an  important  public  health  problem. 

The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  understand  obesity  among  Saudi  female  population  belonging  to  Makkah  community. 
Obesity  has  been  studied  by  measuring  leptin  concentration,  and  other  measurements  like  body  mass  index  (BMI)  and 
waist  circumference  (WC). 

This  study  included  240  women  aged  between  18  and  65 and  the  participants  were  divided  into  three  groups. 
The  normal  or  control  group  whose  BMI  ranged  from  18  to  29.9  comprised  the  first  group,  the  obese  characterized  by  the 
BMI  >30  formed  the  second  group  and  the  obese  diabetic  group  with  body  mass  index  (BMI)  >30  formed  the  third  group. 
The  parameters  collected  included  height,  weight,  and  waist  circumference  and  blood  samples.  Blood  samples  were  later 
thawed. 

Serum  leptin  levels  in  all  the  groups  were  detected  using  ELISA  and  their  means  found  to  be  8.4+1. 4  in 
normal56.3+I8.8  in  obese  and  42+19.3  in  a  diabetic  obese  group.  In  the  normal  group,  the  leptin  levels  were  directly 
associated  with  BMI  (r  =  0.152,  p  =  0.178),  and  leptin  levels  showed  strong  positive  correlation  in  obese  and  diabetic  obese 
groups  as  the  follow:  r  =  0.350,  p  =  0.001  and  r  =  0.355,  p  =  0.001.  Also,  leptin  concentrations  were  positively  correlated 
with  BMI  and  WC  in  obese  and  diabetic  obese  groups,  showing  high  leptin  concentration  in  both  the  groups. 

It  is  understood  that  leptin  hormone  influences  appetite  and  body  weight,  causing  obesity.  However,  fasting, 
hypertension,  practice  physical  activity,  smoking  or  following  special  diet  results  in  changes  to  serum  leptin  concentration.

INTRODUCTION 

An  abnormal  or  excessive  accumulation  of  body  fat  in  adipose  tissue  leads  to  obesity,  impairing  health  (1). 
It  is  unhealthy  to  have  excess  weight.  Hypertension,  hypertriglyceridemia,  hypercholesterolemia  and  high  glucose  level  are 
all  due  to  obesity.  The  interaction  between  genotype  and  the  environment  develops  into  obesity,  a  complex  of 
multifactorial  disease,  involving  the  integration  of  various  factors  such  as  social,  behavioral,  cultural, 
physiological,  metabolic,  and  genetic  (2).  Being  a  risk  factor  for  metabolic  syndrome,  obesity  is  associated  with  T2DM,

hypertension,  hypertriglyceridemia,  hypercholesterolemia,  which  lead  to  heart  disease  (2).  Therefore,  obesity  poses  a  real 
threat  to  health  (3). 

Among  the  Saudi  population,  obesity  is  considered  a  major  health  threat.  According  to  a  study,  in  an  overall 
population  aged  14-70  years,  13.05%  of  males  and  20.26%  of  females  were  obese,  which  is  higher  than  that  reported  in  the 
United  Kingdom,  Australian,  Americans  and  Italian  populations  (4). 

Physiology  of  Obesity  and  Weight  Loss  Therapies 

The  interaction  of  the  feeding  center,  located  in  the  lateral  hypothalamic  nucleus,  and  the  satiety  center, 
located  in  the  ventromedial  nucleus  of  the  hypothalamus  is  key  to  the  regulation  of  appetite.  In  response  to  signals  from 
both  adipose  tissue  and  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  the  brain  regulates  energy  homeostasis.  It  is  necessary  to  arrive  at  a 
balance  between  the  urge  to  eat  and  energy  expenditure  overtime  so  that  the  body  weight  remains  stable  (6). 
It  is  essential  to  understand  the  cause  of  obesity,  the  role  of  appetite  as  it  relates  to  energy  intake  and  weight  gain  so  that 
efficacious  weight-loss  therapies  are  developed.  Several  compounds  appear  to  play  important  role  in  the  regulation  of  food 
intake,  circulating  nutrients  (eg,  glucose,  amino  acids,  and  fatty  acids),  metabolic  compounds  (eg,  lactate,  pyruvate,  and 
ketone  bodies),  and  hormones  (eg,  insulin,  glucagon,  cholecystokinin,  leptin,  and  ghrelin)  (7). 

A  peptide  hormone  secreted  by  adipose  tissue,  leptin  (from  the  Greek  word  leptos,  meaning  thin)  influences 
energy  homeostasis,  immune  and  neuroendocrine  functions  (8).  It  has  been  well  established  in  humans  that  plasma  leptin 
levels  are  directly  proportional  to  body  fat  percentage.  High  concentration  of  leptin  is  very  common  among  obese 
individuals,  especially  in  their  serum  and  plasma,  exhibiting  leptin  resistance  because  of  either  decreased  leptin  transport 
into  the  central  nervous  system  or  downregulation  of  leptin  receptors  (9,10). 

Waist  circumference  (WC)  was  not  included  in  Preliminary  data  analysis  of  leptin  concentration  across  the  range 
of  BMI.  Furthermore,  the  relationship  between  leptin  level  and  WC  have  not  been  assessed  in  a  sample  of  adults  with 
differences  in  age,  fasting,  physical  activity  and  hypertension  (12,  13). 

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  relationship  of  leptin  with  BMI  and  waist  circumference  in  a  random 
sample  of  adult  women  ranging  from  normal  weight  to  severely  obese.  Through  this  study,  a  direct  relationship  of  leptin 
with  BMI  and  waist  circumference  was  anticipated.  The  relationship  of  these  hormones  with  diabetes,  hypertension, 
and  fasting  was  also  studied. 

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS 

Approved  by  the  University  of  Umm-Alqura  Institutional  Review  Board,  this  study  obtained  signed  an  informed 
consent  form.  The  study  was  carried  out  at  Umm  AL-Quran  University,  AL-Noor  Specialist  Hospital  (Diabetic  Centre)  and 
King  Abdul-Aziz  Hospital  (AL-Zaher).  All  blood  analyses  were  carried  out  in  the  University  Physiology  Department  and 
Professor  Sultan  research  laboratory  at  Umm  AL-Qura  University. 

Subjects 

The  study  participant  included  240  women  aged  18-65  and  was  divided  into  three  groups  (see  below). 

First  group:  The  Control  group  (normal)  comprised  80  volunteers,  with  the  BMI  ranging  from  18  to  29.99.

Obesity  in  Saudi  Female  Population 


First  and  Second  Groups  Met  the  Following  Criteria 

•  Should  not  be  on  any  diet  or  use  any  medication  that  can  interfere  with  the  result. 

•  Should  not  perform  any  physical  activity  interfering  with  the  result. 

Third  group:  The  Diabetic  Ohese  Group  Comprised  80  volunteers  with  the  BMI  of  >30. 

Anthropometric  Measurements 

BMI  is  calculated  as  kg/m^.  Height  was  measured  to  the  nearest  centimeter  using  a  Harpenden  anthropometer 
(Holtain,  Ltd,  Crymych,  UK).  Weight  was  measured  to  the  nearest  0.1  kg  using  a  Scaletronix  scale 
(Sharp  Corp,  Wheaton,  IL,  model  695,  weighing  to  364  kg).  Subjects  were  divided  based  on  five  BMI  categories  as 
follows  (2);  normal  weight,  <25;  overweight,  25  to  29.9;  obese  I,  30  to  34.9;  obese  II,  35  to  39.9;  severely  obese,  >40. 
The  BMI  of  participants  were  not  <18.5.  Waist  circumference  was  measured  by  locating  the  upper  hip  bone  and  placing  a 
measuring  tape  around  the  abdomen  (ensuring  that  the  tape  measure  is  horizontal)  (14). 

Hormone  Levels 

Plasma  obtained  by  centrifugation  of  blood  samples  collected  after  an  overnight  fast  was  stored  at  -70°C  in  the 
Microbiology  Department. 

Using  the  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  kit  and  once  the  samples  thawed,  leptin  levels  were  measured  in 
duplicate.  Leptin  kits  were  purchased  from  the  Millipore  Corporation  Research  Inc  (St  Charles,  MO,  U.SA)  and  were  used 
to  test  hormone  levels  at  Professor  Sultan  Research  Laboratory. 

Statistical  Analysis 

The  SPSS  software  (version  11.5,  2002)  was  used  for  descriptive  statistical  analyses.  For  all  analyses, 
the  statistical  significance  was  set  at  P  =  0.05.  The  relationship  of  BMI,  waist  circumference  with  leptin  concentrations  in 
these  subjects  groups  (normal,  obese  and  obese  diabetic)  were  determined  using  Pearson  correlation  coefficients. 
Correlation  is  defined  as  a  measure  of  the  strength  of  a  linear  relationship  between  two  variables.  The  statistical  measure  of 
linear  association  is  known  as  the  correlation  coefficient,  denoted  by  the  symbol  r,  which  measures  how  close  the  points  lie 
on  a  straight  line,  whose  values  always  lie  between  -1  and  H-l.  The  value  H-1  indicates  a  perfect  positive  relationship 
between  the  two  variables  and-1  indicates  a  perfect  negative  relationship.  In  addition,  a  p-value  is  the  probability  of  getting 
the  observed  difference.  If  the  p-value  is  greater  than  0.05,  then  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  observed  difference  could  have 
occurred  by  chance  and  there  is  no  statistically  significant  evidence  (at  the  5%  level)  for  a  difference  between  the  groups  in 
the  population. 

Result 

The  study  samples  were  240  women  aged  between  17  and  65  years,  with  a  mean  age  of  32.7  +  13.75  years,  height 
1.54  +  6.3  m,  and  weight  74.9  ±  17.5  kg  (see  table  1).

DISCUSSIONS 

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  measure  the  relation  between  BMI,  WC  and  leptin  concentration  to  understand 
obesity  in  the  Saudi  female  population.  BMI  and  WC  were  directly  associated  with  leptin  levels,  showing  a  significant 
positive  correlation  between  leptin  and  BMI  categories. 

Due  to  both  increased  fat  cell  number  (hyperplasia)  and  increased  fat  cell  size  (15),  obesity  is  characterized  by 
increased  adipose  tissue  mass.  As  the  most  significant  contributor  to  ill  health,  obesity  is  now  very  common  in  the  world’s 
population,  which  is  also  replacing  under  nutrition  and  infectious  diseases.  In  the  United  States,  obesity  currently  affects 
30%  of  the  adult  population  and  in  KSA  it  affects  35.5%  (16). 

As  the  anthropometric  measurement  for  obesity  and  fat  content,  the  current  study  used  BMI  and  WC.  Many 
studies  confirmed  the  association  of  BMI  and  WC  with  obesity  and  fat  content.  Correlating  strongly  with  fat  mass 
measurement  is  BMI,  though  it  is  unable  to  distinguish  to  fat  mass  from  lean  mass  (17).  On  the  contrary,  a  patient’s 
abdominal  fat  content  can  be  measured  based  on  waist  circumference,  which  is  clinically  acceptable  (18).

Obesity  and  leptin  Concentration 

The  uniqueness  of  this  study  is  that  in  adult  Saudi  women  leptin  concentrations  were  assessed  for  all  BMI  range, 
considering  various  risk  factors  such  as  waist  circumference,  age  diabetes,  and  physical  activity. 

According  to  previous  studies,  in  the  healthy  communities,  based  on  the  nationality,  there  is  only  little  variation  in 
leptin  concentrations.  A  recent  study  indicated  that  leptin  concentrations  in  Omani  control  subjects  were  10.6  (+  4.2)  ng/ml 
(19)  and  in  American  control  subjects,  it  was  7.8  (+  0.7)  ng/ml  (20).  Based  on  this  study,  the  normal  mean  leptin 
concentration  was  8.4  (+1.4)  ng/ml  in  Saudi  women. 

Various  studies  reported  leptin  levels  were  higher  in  obese  individuals  compared  to  normal  weight  individuals 
(21,22).  In  both  obese  and  non-obese  subjects,  leptin  seems  to  correlate  better  with  subcutaneous  fat  compared  with 
visceral  fat,  irrespective  of  the  weight  (23,  24).  It  has  been  understood  that  leptin  concentrations  are  higher  in  obese 
subjects  (see  table  1),  mainly  because  of  a  diminished  response  by  the  leptin  receptor  signaling  pathway, 
leptin's  poor  penetration  of  the  blood-brain  barrier,  or  the  presence  of  less  active  molecular  forms  of  leptin  (25). 
Leptin  deficiency  in  normal  subjects  compared  to  obese  subjects  can  be  a  likely  target  for  leptin  therapy,  but  an  obese 
subject  with  high  levels  of  leptin  are  likely  to  be  resistant  to  leptin  therapy  (26).  Obesity  can  lead  to  leptin  resistance, 
which  may  also  be  due  to  a  lack  of  sensitivity  to  circulating  leptin  contributing  to  the  etiology  of  obesity  (27). 

There  is  an  increased  concentration  of  serum  leptin  -based  on  increased  body  fat  content.  The  increased  release  of 
leptin  from  large  fat  cells  is  the  proof  for  the  positive  correlation  between  body  fat  and  serum  leptin.  In  addition, 
fat  content  can  be  assessed  based  on  the  serum  leptin  levels,  whose  level  may  decrease  by  reduction  of  body  fat, 
maintaining  the  BMI  values  (28). 

Although  insulin  levels  are  not  assessed,  previous  studies  proved  that  leptin  is  directly  associated  with  insulin 
resistance  (29,30).  However,  in  the  diabetic  obese  group,  leptin  concentrations  were  lower  compared  to  those  in  the  obese 
group  but  still  higher  compared  to  the  normal  group  (31).  The  differences  in  fat  distribution  between  the  obese  diabetic 
and  the  obese  nondiabetic  groups  may  be  the  reason  for  this.  Studies  have  demonstrated  that  subcutaneous  fat  produces 
more  leptin  compared  to  visceral  fat.  diabetic  subjects  have  more  visceral  fat  and  less  subcutaneous  fat  because  insulin  is 
an  important  stimulator  of  leptin  production  (31). 

Profound  insulin  deficiency  leads  to  uncontrolled  diabetes  which  in  turn  is  realized  by  behavioral  markers  and 
metabolic  concerns,  such  as  severe  hyperglycemia,  depletion  of  body  fat  mass,  and  reduced  circulating  leptin  levels  that 
stimulate  food  intake  (32).  It  is  essential  to  understand  whether  the  subcellular  and  tissue  distribution  of  leptin  are  different 
in  human  adipocytes  obtained  from  lean  and  diabetic  obese  individuals  and  whether  it  can  be  altered  by  effectors  such  as 
insulin  (33). 

In  spite  of  controlling  the  glucose  level,  high  levels  of  leptin  are  observed  in  diabetic  obesity, 
as  leptin  antagonizes  insulin's  action  in  the  liver,  which  is  influenced  by  the  changes  in  intrahepatic  glucose  with  increased 
gluconeogenesis  and  decreased  glycogenolysis.  It  is  likely  that  these  leptin's  metabolic  effects  regulate  hepatic  glucose 
metabolism  under  physiological  conditions  (34).

Obesity  in  Saudi  Female  Population 


Obesity  and  Anthropometric  Measurements 

As  demonstrated  by  this  study,  BMI  and  WC  correlate  well  with  leptin  concentration  in  all  subject  groups. 
This  is  achieved  by  the  close  relation  of  BMI,  WC  and  body  fat  content  along  with  the  role  of  visceral  and  subcutaneous  fat 
for  producing  leptin  (35,36). 

In  our  study,  the  mean  BMI  in  normal  obese  and  diabetic  obese  groups  were,  respectively,  22.7  (+  2.8),  35.7 
(+  5.2)  and  35.4  (+  4.3)[AQ;  three  set  of  values  are  provided  for  two  parameters.  Please  check  and  edit  as  necessary.]. 
BMI  and  body  weight  are  correlated,.  Based  on  the  reported  data,  BMI  and  leptin  concentrations  were  higher  in  obese 
women  compared  to  other  groups.  The  WC  mean  in  the  normal,  obese  and  diabetic  obese  groups  were  72.9  (+  7.5), 
I0I.6  (+12)  and  106.6  (+12.4),  indicating  that  the  high  WC  was  found  in  the  obese  and  diabetic  obese  compared  to  the 
normal  group. 

According  to  the  findings  of  the  current  study,  there  is  a  positive  relationship  between  BMI  and  WC, 
demonstrating  that  increase  in  BMI  will  in  turn  cause  increase  in  WC  and  leptin  concentration  (See  figure  3). 

CONCLUSIONS 

A  Middle  Eastern  country  with  approximately  23  million  populations,  Saudi  Arabia  has  shown  significant 
economic  and  cultural  changes  over  the  past  thirty  years.  Approximately  60%  of  the  population  is  urbanized  and  have 
adopted  lifestyle  according  to  their  diet  and  physical  activity. 

In  today's  world,  obesity  has  become  a  major  health  issue  as  it  is  linked  to  hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  and 
diabetes  and  insulin  resistance  syndrome.  Over  the  past  several  years.  Data  have  shown  a  worldwide  increase  in  the 
number  of  obese  people.  In  Saudi  Arabia,  the  prevalence  of  obesity  among  female  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  male  adults  has 
reached  epidemic  proportions. 

Based  on  the  findings  of  this  study  and  other  studies,  obesity  and  being  overweight  are  the  major  public  health 
issues  of  women  in  Saudi  Arabia. 

In  Saudi  Arabia,  limited  physical  activity,  limited  availability  of  exercise  facilities  for  women  and  limited  awareness  of 
obesity-related  health  risks  among  the  population  are  the  reasons  for  the  prevalence  of  obesity  among  Saudi  women.
