Preface 


This  supplement  to  the  guide  prepared  in  1987  by  the  staff  of  the  Microform  Reading  Room  reflects 
the  continuing  proliferation  of  micropublications  and  the  continuing  need  for  consistent  and  informative 
bibliographic  control  of  special  collections  and  major  titles  in  microformats.  This  supplement,  nearly  twice 
the  size  of  the  guide  published  in  1987,  reflects  receipts  of  the  Library  of  Congress  Microform  Reading  Room, 
and  in  a  few  cases,  receipts  which  have  since  been  transferred  to  the  custody  of  other  reading  rooms  at  the 
Library.  Users  of  this  guide  should  be  reminded  that  these  other  reading  rooms  have  significant  microformat 
collections  in  their  custody,  and  that  neither  the  previous  guide,  nor  this  supplement,  can  be  used  to  identify 
their  holdings. 

The  following  current  and  former  members  of  the  Humanities  and  Social  Sciences  (General  Reading 
Rooms)  Division  staff,  and  the  Special  Materials  Cataloging  unit  of  the  Library,  deserve  credit  for  their 
contributions  to  this  supplement;  they  contributed  bibliographic  descriptions  and  cataloging  data  as  well  as 
technical  assistance  and  collegial  support:  Cheryl  Adams,  Pablo  Calvan,  Becky  Gates-Coon,  Robert 
Costenbader,  Lee  Douglas,  Patrick  Frazier,  Victoria  Hill,  Mary  Kramer,  Lois  Korzendorfer,  Michael  Lynch,

Introduction 


This  supplement,  like  the  guide  it  supplements,  has  been  compiled  to  draw  attention  to  and  to 
describe  some  of  the  major  special  collections  and  significant  single  titles  in  microform  in  the  Microform 
Reading  Room.  The  microforms  represented  in  this  guide  include  reproductions  as  well  as  original 
micropublications  and  contain  books,  serials,  manuscripts,  pamphlets,  dissertations,  government  documents 
and  archival  records,  archival  records  of  associations  and  businesses,  personal  papers,  broadcasting  transcripts, 
and  a  variety  of  ephemera.  The  languages  covered  include  the  same  languages  found  in  the  Library’s  general 
hardcopy  collection;  the  range  of  subjects  covered  is  as  broad,  if  not  broader,  than  those  found  in  the  book 
collections. 

The  majority  of  the  items  described  may  be  found  in  the  Microform  Reading  Room  (MicRR),  but  a 
few  are  located  in  the  Business  Reading  Room  (B&E),  the  Local  History  and  Genealogy  Reading  Room 
(LH&G),  the  Prints  and  Photographs  Division  (P&P),  the  Manuscript  Division  (MSS),  the  Near  East  Division 
(Near  East),  and  the  Law  Library  (Law).  The  collections  included  here  represent  many,  but  not  all  the 
collections  added  to  the  Microform  Reading  Room  between  the  1987  publishing  of  the  Microform  Collections 
guide  and  October  1989.  Since  then,  approximately  two  hundred  new  collections  have  been  received  by  the 
Microform  Reading  Room,  and  a  second  supplement  and  other  forms  of  bibliographic  access,  including  online 
access,  are  being  planned. 

Each  record  in  this  supplement  is  composed  of  bibliographic  data  including  a  description  of  the 
collection,  the  appropriate  shelf  number  or  numbers,  reference  to  relevant  published  and  unpublished  finding 
aids  (if  available),  and  information  on  how  to  find  material  in  the  collection  (if  appropriate).  The  records  are 
arranged  alphabetically  by  main  entry,  which  is  usually  the  title.  A  subject  index  and  list  by  title  and  added 
title  appear  at  the  end  of  the  guide. 

As  of  June  1991,  the  published  and  unpublished  finding  aids  previously  located  in  the  Microform 
Reading  Room  will  be  housed  in  the  Library’s  Main  Reading  Room  reference  collection.  The  reference  staff 
of  that  Reading  Room  should  be  consulted  for  assistance  with  or  access  to  these  guides  and  their 
corresponding  microform  collection.

To  record  the  early,  dynamic  years  of  the  organized  labor  movement  in  America,  Richard  T.  Ely  established 
the  American  Bureau  of  Industrial  Research  in  1904.  The  Bureau  is  best  known  for  its  eleven-volume 
Documentary  History  of  American  Industrial  Society  (1910-1911);  in  preparing  this  work,  Ely  and  others  spent 
years  assembling  primary  source  materials,  virtually  none  of  which  were  published  in  the  Documentary  History. 
The  holdings  filmed  in  this  collection  actually  consist  of  nine  separate  collections:  six  focus  on  important  19th 


4 


century  labor  leaders,  two  with  national  labor  organizations,  and  the  ninth,  with  an  extensive  1904  survey  of 
American  public  opinion  on  labor  issues.  The  personal  papers  include  correspondence,  notebooks,  business 
papers,  broadsides,  typescripts,  and  so  on.  Among  the  papers  are  Albert  Parson’s  notes  taken  during  the 
Haymarket  Trial.  The  collection  is  significant  for  the  study  of  virtually  any  early  American  labor  issue, 
including  the  eight-hour  movement,  women  in  industry,  political  reform,  radicalism  and  early  critiques  of 
capitalism.

The  Fabian  Society  was  founded  in  1884  and  rapidly  became  Britain’s  foremost  organization  of  socialist 
intellectuals.  It  has  played  a  key  role  in  the  development  of  British  democratic  socialist  thinking,  in  the 
development  of  the  Labour  Party,  the  philosophy  and  programs  of  the  British  welfare  state,  and  the  founding 
of  the  London  School  of  Economics.  Its  early,  and  very  influential  members,  included  Beatrice  and  Sidney 
Webb,  George  Bernard  Shaw,  and  later  H.  G.  Wells  and  G.  D.  H.  and  Margaret  Cole.  The  Fabian  Society  was 
an  active  publisher  of  its  own  tracts,  it  sponsored  lectures  and  summer  schools,  and  carried  out  a  variety  of 
political  and  social  projects;  it  supported  and  ran  candidates  for  Parliament,  etc.

Berlin,  capital  of  Prussia  during  the  years  covered  by  this  collection,  was  a  city  of  great  cultural,  political, 
and  economic  influence  and  dynamism.  The  information  in  these  directories  is  of  importance  to  researchers 
of  genealogy,  biography,  and  the  social,  cultural,  and  political  history  of  Berlin. 

These  city  directories  listed  residents  (i.e.,  heads  of  household)  by  name,  as  well  as  companies  and  businesses; 
but  each  directory  also  included  a  great  deal  of  other  information:  tradesmen  and  merchants  were  listed  by 
trade;  also  listed  were  public  authorities,  institutions,  places,  schools,  churches,  synagogues,  cemeteries, 
associations  and  societies,  newspapers  and  magazines,  social  insurance,  public  health,  and  other  social  welfare 
services,  and  medical  and  legal  professionals. 

These  directories  also  served  as  a  local  and  national  reference  manual,  publishing  information  on  public 
services  and  affairs,  including  fairs  and  markets,  local  and  national  government,  events  and  places  of  interest; 
public  transportation  and  postal  services  and  fees,  monuments,  wildlife  preserves,  etc.  Another  section  of  the 
directories  listed  streets  alphabetically  within  the  twenty  administrative  districts  into  which  Berlin  was  then 
divided,  with  plots  of  land  and  houses  listed  by  number,  naming  the  corresponding  property  owner  or  manager 
and  residents. 

GUIDE:  A  printed  pamphlet  guide,  in  English  and  German,  is  kept  with  the  collection. 

The  guide  explains  the  significance,  history,  and  arrangement  of  the  information  in  the  directories.  The 
guide  also  provides  cross-references  from  contemporary  district  designations  (e.g.  Berlin  33)  to  those  used 
formerly  (Dahlem). 

For  access  to  the  collection,  request  guide,  and  year  or  years  desired. 

NOTES  ON  USE:  These  directories  are  also  available  on  microfilm  for  the  years  1891-1941,  under  the

The  Black  Sash  was  called  into  being  in  1955  by  a  group  of  white  South  African  women  determined  to

among  its  members  many  eminent  South  African  women.  The  Black  Sash  has  protested  and  organized 
consistently  and  dramatically,  against  pass  laws,  detentions,  removals  to  the  "homelands,"  etc.  In  1963,  the 
group  opened  itself  to  non-white  members. 

This  collection  spans  the  dates  1955-1972,  and  consists  of  the  speeches,  administrative  records,  minutes  and 
memoranda  of  national  conferences,  internal  and  external  correspondence,  and  records  of  political  actions,  of

This  collection  consists  of  nearly  700  pamphlets  and  newsletters  published  during  the  Spanish  Civil  War 
(1936-1939).  Although  most  of  these  were  produced  in  Spain,  a  number  were  published  elsewhere  in  Europe, 
or  in  the  United  States  or  Cuba.  The  pamphlets  represent  both  Republican  and  Loyalist  factions,  and  a  broad 
range  of  ideologies.  Among  the  items  filmed  are  a  speech  by  Andre  Malraux,  pamphlets  by  Dolores  Ibarruri, 
by  Joseph  Goebbels,  Gil  Robles,  and  others.  Many  of  the  titles  are  also  included  in  a  related  collection,

Microfilm  88/329  <MicRR> 

The  Commission  on  Interracial  Cooperation  grew  out  of  the  concern  over  racial  tension  and  riots  which 
followed  after  the  return  of  black  American  servicemen  from  World  War  I.  It  was  formed  in  1919  as  a 
moderate  coalition  of  blacks  and  whites,  with  the  goals  of  promoting  better  race  relations  through  public 
awareness  and  educational  efforts.  The  Association  of  Southern  Women  for  the  Prevention  of  Lynching  was 
an  offshoot  of  the  CIC,  and  merged  back  into  it  in  1942.  The  papers  of  the  ASWPL  are  also  available  in  the 
Microform  Reading  Room,  as  are  the  papers  of  the  Southern  Regional  Council,  into  which  the  CIC  merged 
in  1944.  The  CIC  collection  consists  of  correspondence,  minutes  of  meetings,  pamphlets  and  reports,  and 
educational  material  published  by  the  CIC. 

Among  the  persons  involved  in  the  CIC  were  Will  Alexander  and  various  YMCA  figures;  Robert  Moton 
(Tuskegee),  John  Hope  (Morehouse  College);  Jessie  Daniel  Ames;  Mary  McLeod  Bethune;  and  Charlotte 
Hawkins  Brown. 

Some  of  the  research  sponsored  by  the  CIC  included  studies  and  surveys  of  black  education  and  housing 
conditions,  investigations  of  the  Ku  Klux  Klan,  lynching,  and  police  brutality;  the  CIC  also  provided  legal  aid 
to  the  defendants  in  the  Scottsboro  case. 

Another  offshoot  of  the  CIC  was  the  Commission  on  the  Study  of  the  Participation  of  the  Negro  in 
Southern  Life,  which  eventually  published  several  books,  including  Sharecroppers  All  and  The  Legal  Status 
of  the  Negro;  also  created  by  the  CIC  was  the  Special  Committee  on  Negroes  and  Economic  Reconstruction, 
dealing  with  farm  tenancy  in  the  South.

written  as  early  as  the  16th  and  17th  centuries.  In  addition  to  doctoral  dissertations,  the  collection  consists 
of  master’s  dissertations,  Habilitationsschriften,  and  scientific  works.  The  collection  represents  not  only  most 
of  the  dissertations  written  at  Tubingen  University,  but  also  dissertations  from  universities  in  other  countries,

Microfilm  1380-1385  (13  reels,  narrative);  and  3046-3052  (55  reels,  documentation)  <  MicRR  > 

These  13  reels  of  narrative  and  55  reels  of  documentation,  compiled  at  the  behest  of  Allied  occupation 
authorities  in  the  mid-  and  late  1940’s,  describe  the  Luftwaffe’s  participation  in  World  War  II.  The  collection 
is  of  unusual  importance  because  most  Luftwaffe  documents  were  destroyed  when  Allied  advances  made 
Germany’s  defeat  certain,  and  the  original  documents  of  this  collection  (commonly  called  the  "von  Rohden 
collection")  were  returned  to  the  German  Federal  Republic  in  1967  and  since  then  have  been  difficult  to  access 
by  American  scholars.  For  many  researchers,  the  von  Rohden  films  offer  the  only  access  to  the  history  of 
Luftwaffe  activities. 

An  additional  73  reels  of  documentation  is  available  at  the  National  Archives  under  the  number  T-971,  as 
well  as  an  unpublished  index  to  their  contents.  These  additional  reels  contain  much  that  the  Microform 
Reading  Room  collection  does  not  have,  although  they  also  duplicate  many  documents  in  the  collection  here. 
The  Library’s  films  contain  unique  documents,  especially  after  reel  13  of  the  document  section. 

Further  information  on  the  history  of  this  collection  and  on  other  collections  of  German  World  War  II

The  Great  Northern  (GN)  Railway  was  one  of  the  powerful  transcontinental  railroads,  presided  over  for 
many  years  by  James  Jerome  Hill.  Like  the  other  railroads,  the  GN  sponsored  settlement  and  economic 
development  along  its  lines,  which  ran  through  the  northwestern  frontier  (Minnesota,  North  Dakota,  Montana, 
Idaho,  Oregon,  and  Washington).  Also  like  the  other  major  railroads,  the  GN  was  important  in  shaping  big 
business  management  techniques,  finance,  and  labor  relations. 

The  collection  is  divided  in  three  parts;  the  first  consists  of  company  histories,  records  of  financial  and  land 
dealings,  and  stockholders’  and  directors’  meetings.  The  second,  relatively  extensive  section,  reproduces 
detailed  records  concerning  labor  contracts,  strikes,  alien  labor,  radicalism  (and  the  IWW),  and  settlement 
attempts.  The  Shop  Strikes  of  the  early  1920’s  are  documented  in  greatest  detail. 

The  last  section  of  the  collection  concerns  the  immigration  to,  agricultural  development,  and  settlement  of 
the  lands  around  the  GN  lines,  as  well  as  irrigation  and  conservation  projects,  including  the  establishment  of 
Glacier  National  Park. 

GUIDE:  MicRR  Guide  No.  105-146 

The  guide  consists  of  three  separate  reel  guides,  one  for  each  part  of  the  collection;  each  reel  list  is  also 
followed  by  an  index  for  that  part. 

NOTES  ON  USE:  This  collection  is  edited  from  the  complete  archives,  and  contains  only  those  materials 
dealing  with  "broad  corporate  policies,  labor  relations,  and  settlement  and  development  activities"  from  1862 
to  1922,  with  a  few  files  extending  into  the  following  two  decades.

important  Viennese  paper,  Neue  Freie  Presse.  from  October  1891  to  June  1895. 

These  reports  include  all  telegrams  and  political  essays  and  views  printed  by  this  paper,  as  well  as  some 
previously  unprinted  supplementary  meterial  on  the  subject  of  political  life  in  Paris  and  France.  This  was  a

Microfilm  86/2093  <  MicRR  > 

The  Office  of  Strategic  Services  and  the  State  Department  commissioned  leading  scholars  in  international 
affairs  to  write  top-secret  reports  during  World  War  II  and  the  Cold  War.  This  collection  of  intelligence  and 
research  reports  covers  the  period  from  1941  to  1949,  a  crucial  time  in  the  formation  of  Israel  and  the 
development  of  Middle  Eastern  relations. 

The  reports  are  organized  by  country  beginning  with  general  reports  on  the  Middle  East  region,  followed 
by  studies  on  Afghanistan,  Egypt,  Iran,  Kuwait,  Levant  States,  Libya,  Palestine,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria, 
Transjordan,  and  Turkey.  These  background  and  intelligence  studies  cover  such  topics  as  Zionism  and  Jewish

immigration  to  Palestine,  the  arming  of  the  Jews  and  Arabs  in  the  region,  strategic  surveys  of  various  countries 
including  political  parties  and  personalities  of  major  figures,  oil  production,  and  Soviet  relations  with  these

Oneida  community:  books,  pamphlets,  and  serials,  1834-1972.  --  Filmed  from  holdings  of:  George  Arents 
Research  Library,  Syracuse  University,  and  from  holdings  in  several  private  collections.  -  Jack  T.  Ericson, 
editor.  -  Glen  Rock,  N.J.:  Microfilming  Corporation  of  America,  1973.  -  <4>  microfilm  reels;  35  mm. 

Microfilm  60282  <  MicRR  > 

The  Oneida  Community  was  founded  by  John  Humphrey  Noyes  in  1847  in  western  New  York  State.  Inspired 
by  the  "Great  Awakening"  revivalism  of  1831,  Noyes  first  created  an  unofficial  community,  which  then  acquired 
formal  and  financial  standing.  The  Community  was  based  on  a  "Perfectionist"  philosophy  which  was  itself  an 
offshoot  of  Wesleyan  Methodism;  however,  it  is  perhaps  best  known  for  its  advocacy  of  "free  love"  (sexual 
love-and  birth  control-outside  of  marriage),  and  "complex  marriage,"  including  common  homes  and  communal 
care  of  children.  The  Oneida  Community  was  successful  at  several  manufacturing  ventures  which  its  members 
commonly  owned.  The  membership  numbered  about  300  at  its  height,  and  enjoyed  support  from  the  local 
towns  and  farms;  the  Community  pioneered  not  only  new  marital  and  family  relations  but  also,  in  their 
manufactures,  progressive  labor  policies  (worker  night  schools,  piece-work,  and  the  eight-hour  day).  The 
Community  disbanded  in  1879. 

The  microform  collection  consists  of  69  books  and  pamphlets  by  and  about  the  Oneida  Community, 
published  between  1848  and  1972;  and  approxiamately  ten  serials,  1834-1879.

The  National  War  Labor  Board  (NWLB)  grew  out  of  the  Wilson  Administration’s  President’s  Mediation 
Commission  (whose  records  are  also  available  in  the  Microform  Reading  Room).  Like  the  Mediation 
Commission,  the  NWLB  was  established  as  a  tripartite  group,  by  Secretary  of  Labor  William  B.  Wilson.  The 
charge  of  the  NWLB  was  to  systematize  federal  labor  policies,  particularly  by  intervening  in  labor  disputes. 
Never  a  powerful  body,  the  NWLB  nevertheless  recommended  such  standards  as  an  eight-hour  workday,  and 
equal  pay  for  women  for  equal  work.  For  those  union  and  employers  who  sought  the  NWLB’s  assistance,  the 
Board  obtained  the  advantages  of  the  eight-hour  day,  higher  wages,  union  recognition,  and  formal  grievance 
procedures.  The  NWLB’s  authority  came  to  an  end  in  the  aftermath  of  the  First  World  War. 

The  collection  consists  of  digests,  resumes,  reports,  findings,  awards,  and  other  documentation  of  the  cases 
taken  up  by  the  NWLB.  These  are  indexed  by  city,  by  names  of  the  parties  (unions  and  employers)  involved, 
and  the  occupations  and  issues  involved. 

In  addition  to  the  case  files,  this  collection  reproduces  the  minutes  of  the  Executive  Sessions  of  the  Board 
(reels  6-13, 20,  and  21);  also,  six  major  cases  have  been  documented  in  greater  detail  than  the  others,  on  reels 
13-19.  Similarly  extensive  files  for  other  cases  have  been  excluded  from  this  microform  collection,  but  may 
be  viewed  at  the  Washington  Federal  Records  Center.  The  selected  cases  include  ones  involveing  Machinists 
locals  in  Bridgeport  Connecticut;  GE  workers  in  Lynn,  Massachusetts;  Western  Union  workers  in  New  York 
City;  Bethlehem  Steel  machinists;  and  railway  employees  in  Cleveland  and  Detroit.

Also  referred  to  as  the  Radical-Socialist  or  simply  the  Radical  Party,  this  political  party  founded  in  1901  both 
was  and  remains  a  centrist  coalition,  despite  its  name.  Opposed  to  General  Charles  de  Gaulle,  and  to 
prevailing  political  directions  after  World  War  II,  the  Radical  Party  rapidly  lost  influence  and  seats  in  the 
French  constituent  assembly.  Among  the  Radicals  who  emerged  in  the  1960’s  as  prominent  national  leaders 
were  Pierre  Mendes-France  and  Edgar  Faure. 

This  collection  documents  the  internal  debates  and  struggles  of  the  party  during  a  difficult  period 
characterized  by  changing  electoral  strategies  and  internal  dissent  and  factionalization. 

GUIDE:  MicRR  Guide  No.  117

President  Woodrow  Wilson  set  up  this  five-person  commission  of  liberals  and  unionists  on  the 
recommendation  of  his  Secretary  of  Labor,  William  B.  Wilson,  who  was  himself  influenced  to  do  so  by  AFL 
President  Samuel  Gompers.  Gompers’  hope  was  that  an  official  (federal)  policy  of  discouraging  growing  labor 
radicalism  (especially  the  IWW),  while  providing  legitimacy  and  protection  to  the  AFL  trade  unions,  would 
be  the  effect  of  the  Commission’s  effort  to  mediate  important  wartime  labor  disputes,  especially  in  the  Western 
mining  industry. 

The  papers  of  the  Commission  are  primarily  records  of  hearings  held  by  the  Commission  in  Arizona  and

File  series  10110  and  10058  from  this  Record  Group  have  been  reproduced  in  part  in  this  microform 
collection.  "Minor"  files,  some  printed  materials  (handbills,  magazines,  pamphlets,  clippings)  and  materials 
concerning  international  communism  and  black  radicals  have  all  been  excluded.  (A  separate  microform 
collection  by  this  publisher.  Surveillance  of  Afro-Americans,  reproduces  the  surveillance  files  concerning  black 
radicals.)  Also  excluded  are  lengthy  lists  of  suspected  subversives.  Finally,  negative  photocopies  in  the  original 
files  have  been  excluded  because  of  their  poor  reproducibility  in  microform. 

Those  items  which  have  been  reproduced  include  extensive  files  concerning  IWW  activities  and  important 
American  radicals  (and  liberals)  such  as  Elizabeth  Gurley  Rynn,  Emma  Goldman,  Benjamin  Reitman, 
Alexander  Berkman,  the  Tom  Mooney  case,  Victor  Berger,  John  Reed,  Bill  Haywood,  Kate  Richards  O’Hare, 
Eugene  Debs,  Alice  Dunbar,  Isadora  Duncan,  Morris  Hilquit,  Roger  Baldwin,  Carl  Sandburg,  and  so  on.  Many

There  are  also  extensive  files  on  the  "Bonus  Army"  (reels  21  and  22),  on  labor  strikes,  on  radical  student 
groups,  women’s  groups,  anti-war  organizations,  Puerto  Rican  political  activities,  as  well  as  some  older  records

This  collection  consists  of  correspondence,  drafts  of  articles,  minutes  of  meetings,  financial  records,  reports, 
pamphlets,  clippings,  and  photographs,  spanning  the  years  1891  to  1952,  but  primarily  dating  from  1917-1952. 
These  documents,  the  business  and  archival  files  of  the  most  influential  American  magazine  of  social  reform 
during  this  period,  are  not  simply  editorial  records  but  a  resource  in  their  own  right  for  the  study  of  the 
history  of  social  conditions  and  social  work  in  the  early  and  mid-twentieth  century  United  States. 

The  Survey  had  a  rich  publishing  history;  it  was  editorially  related  to  several  other  important  social  welfare 
magazines  (Charities.  Lend-A-Hand.  The  Commons,  etc.).  The  journal  solicited  and  published  articles  from 
the  leading  persons  in  all  fields  of  social  welfare-Jane  Addams,  Lillian  Wald,  Alain  Locke,  Stephen  Wise, 
Felix  Frankfurter,  Louis  Brandeis,  Lewis  Mumford,  and  others. 

Part  1,  the  "Forget  Me  Not"  files,  consists  of  records  of  editorial  correspondence,  arranged  alphabetically. 
Part  2,  the  editorial  files,  documents  the  preparation  of  fourteen  special  issues  dealing  with  domestic  and 
international  social  issues  during  World  War  II  and  immediately  after.  Part  3  consists  of  financial  records  of

Microfiche  86/2  <  MicRR  > 

In  1937  a  young  British  anthropologist,  Tom  Harrison,  set  up  Mass-Observation  as  a  social  science  research 
organization  with  the  aim  of  compiling,  through  self-reporting  and  the  observations  of  volunteers,  as  well  as 
the  investigations  of  full-time  staff,  an  "anthropology"  of  the  British  people.  After  the  onset  of  World  War 
II,  the  Director  of  Home  Intelligence  commissioned  Harrison  to  conduct  Mass  Observation  inquiries  to  reveal 
the  attitudes,  morale,  and  social  behavior  of  the  Britons. 

Thousands  of  volunteer  "observers"-ordinary  citizens  from  across  the  country-sent  in  reports  on  a  wide 
variety  of  subjects,  including  wartime  events  and  propaganda,  politics,  pubs,  holiday  activiites,  etc.  The  reports 
consist  of  the  volunteers’  own  observations  as  well  as  transcriptions  of  people’s  conversations  or  answers  to 
questions  on  a  particular  subject.  Over  3000  reports  resulted,  of  widely  varying  length,  and  based  on  varying 
degrees  of  reliance  on  scientific  or  intuitive  methods. 

There  are  reports  here  on  the  acceptance  of  margarine  as  a  butter  substitute,  on  pipe-smoking,  on  the 
carrying  of  gas-masks,  attitudes  toward  (and  behavior  during  )  air  raids,  reactions  to  advertising  and  to 
government  propaganda,  surveys  of  teenage  girls’  activities  in  post-war  London,  and  so  on.  In  addition  to 
reports  of  investigations,  the  files  reproduced  here  include  reports  prepared  for  government  agencies  (the 
Ministry  of  Information)  and  private  businesses  (e.g.  Kemsley  Newspaper),  as  well  as  internal  letters,  directives, 
bulletins,  scripts  of  radio  broadcasts,  draft  manuscripts  of  books,  and  edited  diaries  kept  by  volunteer  diarists. 

The  file  reports  provide  a  fascinating  reflection  of  everyday  citizens’  lives  and  their  responses  to  issues  of 
local  and  national  concern,  especially  those  related  to  World  War  II.

U.S.  Commission  on  Industrial  Relations,  1912-1915:  unpublished  records  of  the  division  of  research  and 
investigation;  reports,  staff  studies,  and  background  research  materials.  —  Filmed  h'om  holdings  of:  the  State

Microfilm  88/350  <MicRR> 

The  Commission  on  Industrial  Relations  was  established  by  Congress  as  a  tripartite  body  of  nine  members, 
representing  employees,  employers,  and  the  public,  "to  inquire  into  the  general  condition  of  labor  in  the 
principal  industries  of  the  United  States,"  including  labor-management  relations,  living  and  working  conditions 
of  employees  and  their  families,  and  alien  and  migratory  labor  (especially  illegal  "Asiatic"  workers).  The 
Commission  was  established  in  the  aftermath  of  violent  labor  confrontations,  in  particular  the  1910  bombing 
of  the  Los  Angeles  Times  building. 

Only  a  select  few  of  the  Commission’s  reports  have  ever  been  published,  despite  efforts  of  some,  such  as  John 
Commons,  to  have  this  done.  Remarkably,  the  reports  were  ordered  by  Congress  to  be  destroyed;  fortunately 
the  vast  majority  were  nevertheless  preserved. 

The  reports  vary  from  several  pages  to  over  a  hundred  pages  in  length,  and  are  arranged  alphabetically  by 
subject,  covering  the  whole  spectrum  of  labor  issues.  Some  of  the  reports  were  written  by  Selig  Perlman,  a 
noted  labor  historian  and  theorist.  The  subjects  covered  include  child  labor,  civil  liberties  (including  the  free 
speech  fights  in  Fresno  and  San  Diego),  bargaining  agreements,  company  towns,  the  cost  of  living,  the 
homeless,  strikes,  lockouts,  and  strikebreaking  (including  for  example  strikes  by  the  IWW,  the  coal  strikes  in 
Colorado,  the  Ludlow  Massacre,  the  Pullman  strikes,  and  the  Chicago  Waitresses’  Strike  of  1914),  hours  of 
labor,  housing,  domestic  servants,  and  so  on.  Scattered  throughout  the  reports  are  "life  histories"  of  workers 
(lumbeijacks,  unemployed  "floating  laborers").

In  1942  President  Roosevelt  issued  Executive  Order  9066  authorizing  the  War  Department  to  evacuate  and 
incarcerate  civilians  as  a  "protection  against  espionage  and  against  sabotage."  More  than  120,000  Japanese 
Americans  were  sent  to  relocation  centers  for  the  duration  of  the  war. 

In  1980  Congress  established  the  Commission  on  Wartime  Relocation  and  Internment  of  Civilians  (CWRIC) 
to  review  Executive  Order  9066  and  its  implementation,  and  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  order  on  those 
relocated  and  interned.  CWIRC  compiled  the  Numerical  File  Archive  of  documentary  materials  from  federal, 
state,  and  private  agencies  (or  other  sources)  and  from  the  papers  of  all  officials  involved.  The  material  in 
this  collection  has  been  filmed  from  Record  Group  220  of  the  Fiscal,  Judicial,  and  Social  Division  of  the

This  archival  collection  dates  back  to  the  18th  century  and  contains  the  work  of  the  Wesleyan  Methodist 
Missionary  Society  in  Africa,  Asia,  Australia,  Europe,  the  Caribbean  region,  and  North  America.  Records 
include  minutes,  finance  ledgers,  missionary  correspondence,  and  much  biographical  material.  A  special 
feature  is  the  extensive  material  on  Dr.  Thomas  Cook,  Wesley’s  "right  hand  man."  The  largest  portion  of  the 
collection  is  the  series  of  records  and  correspondence  from  the  outlying  districts  to  the  London  office.  Two 
smaller  parts  of  the  collection  are  of  note:  one  is  a  series  of  records  relating  to  the  work  of  women 
missionaries  employed  by  the  Society;  and  another  is  a  small  collection  of  records  of  the  Primitive  Methodist 
Church’s  missionary  activity.  The  Archive  itself  is  housed  in  the  Library  of  the  School  of  Oriental  and  African 
Studies  in  London.  This  collection  would  be  useful  for  the  study  of  missionary  work,  the  Methodist  Society 
in  particular,  or  the  role  of  women  in  early  missionary  work.

The  Women’s  Labour  League  was  founded  in  1906  as  a  broadly  based  feminist  group  with  representation 
from  the  Labour  Party,  trade  unions,  and  socialist  and  cooperative  societies.  It  made  investigations,  published 
a  newsletter  for  many  decades,  and  served  as  a  pressure  group  in  such  areas  as  women’s  work  and  its 
regulation  and  safety;  maternal  and  child  care;  education;  housing;  and  institutional  care  for  the  elderly  and 
disabled.  In  1918,  the  Women’s  Labour  League  disappeared  as  a  separate  organization  and  became  an 
integrated  part  of  the  Labour  Party,  as  the  Labour  Party’s  Women’s  Organisation.  It  continued  under  this 
name  until  1977,  when  separate  proceedings  for  the  Women’s  Organisation  were  taken  over  by  the  Labour 
Party. 

GUIDE:  No  separate  guide. 

An  introduction  and  table  of  contents  to  the  microfiches  appears  on  fiche  1  and  is  repeated  at  the  beginning

Index  by  Format  and  Subject 

In  this  index  references  to  entries  are  listed  by  name  under  format  and  subject  headings.  Entries 
themselves  are  arranged  alphabetically  in  the  text.  For  help  in  finding  a  particular  entry,  the  title  index  may 
be  consulted. 

Format  (e.g.  Books;  Correspondence;  Pamphlets)  amd  Subject  (e.g.  Germany-History;  Slavery  and 
antislavery)  headings  have  been  interfiled  below  in  one  single  alphabet.  Format  headings  have  been  adapted 
from  L.C.  usage  for  this  index,  and  have  been  interpret^  broadly  (e.g.  "Archives"  is  used  for  records  of 
governments,  organizations,  and  other  institutions).  Subject  headings  follow  L.C.  usage  as  far  as  possible,  but 
are  simplified,  or  used  broadly,  for  this  index  (e.g.,  the  subdivision  "-History"  is  often  used  without  specifying 
a  chronological  period). 

Every  effort  was  made  to  be  as  accurate  and  inclusive  as  possible,  but  some  microform  collections  are 
by  their  nature  hard  to  categorize.  In  using  the  index  readers  should  try  all  possible  approaches  in  order  to 
make  the  search  productive.
