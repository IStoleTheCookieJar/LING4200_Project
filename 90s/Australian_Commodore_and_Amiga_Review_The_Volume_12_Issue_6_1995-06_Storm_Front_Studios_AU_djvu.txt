The Personal Animation 
Recorder is shaping up to be one of 
the most powerfull and popular Digital 
Video cards for the Amiga. 

Its quality has passed the 
broadcast test at many of Australia's 
commercial television networks. By 
now I'm sure you have seen the PAR 
output on television, but not know 
you've been watching it! 

Many of our clients are using 
the PAR with 3D rendering packages 
such as Lightwave to produce TV 
commercials, Music videos and 
much, much more. 



Here are some of the reasons the 
PAR has become so popular :- 

- Broadcast resolution output 

- Real time 25fps Playback of video 

- Full 24Bit Colour 

- Component output (Betacam® Mlf) 

- Y/C output (S-VHS^HiS®) 

- Composite Video output 

- Interface with any Amiga graphics sM/ 

With the Capture board you add even 
more versatility :- 

- Real time 25ps Capture of live video 

- Component input (Betacam®Mifi) 

- Y/C input (S-VHSPHiSf*) 

- Composite Video input 






Model, Animate & Render with 
the Incredibly powerful New version of 
LIGHTWAVE 3D. Version 4. Some of its 
new features include, Inverse Kinematics, 
Metaform functions and Multi Platform 
support - plus much more.

Imagemaster 
Update 

I Black Belt Systems have released Im- 
agemaster R/t 1.60, an update form the 
1.5 version mentioned in the image pro- 
cessor comparison in this magazine. 

There are what sound like some 
very funky new plasma tools, and vari- 
ous other enhancements to interface 
and documentation. 

Black Belt say the plasma tools can 
generate flame events in still frames or 
over time - gas flames, candles, log and 
forest fires, and even the oil wick of a 
hurricane lamp. 

All of the flame parameters are con- 
figurable - there's independent control 
over the flame's 
base, middle, end 
and tip colours, you 
can control how 
much the flame dis- 
torts the background 
behind it, how tur- 
bulent it is and 
more. 

The plasma suite 
also features an elec- 
trical generator to 
create lightning and 
other electrical ef- 
fects - outdoing 1m- 
ageFX's little light- 



ning tool. You get built in effects like 
Summer Storm, Windstorm, Fibrous 
and Gamma Bursts, and, once again, 
everything's configurable - colour, 
glow, zagging, saturation, taper, width 
and more. As with the flame tools, elec- 
trical effects can be animated over time 
using ARexx, for realistic travelling 
bolts and strikes. 

Among the other tweaks in 1.60 
there's the ability to force all screens to 
4 bit, 8 bit or AGA, which is aimed at 
helping the performance of the weaker 
AGA emulations featured by Amiga 24 
bit graphics boards. 

Contact Black Belt Systems on 
+406 367 5513, fax +406 367 2329 for 
more information.

Correction 

I In last month's Amiga Review we 
mentioned the Adelaide Amiga User 
Group and its free-trial policy; unfortu- 
nately, we cot the name of the Group's 
secretary slightly wrong and his phone 
number completely wrong. 

The secretary's name is Marc 
Johnson, and his number is (OS) 339 
3930. 



New VLAB 

Macrosystems VLAB motion 
software has stepped up to version 2.2, 
New sound editing and capture 
Windows have been added, along with a 
SMPTE generation tool and a disk 
reorg function to gain back wasted video 
and audio partition space. Look for a 
close up test of the system in our July 
issue. Call TV Graphics on (03) 521 
2455 for more information. 



CEI Speaks 

I After the defeat of Creative Equip- 
ment International's cooperative bid 
with Dell for the Amiga technology, 
they've issued a release detailing where 
they plan to go from here, 

CEI affirmed their interest in in li- 
censing Amiga technology and devel- 
oping "new more powerful Amigas", 
and stated that they would still be "ag- 
gressively marketing, supporting, and 
distributing the Amiga and Amiga 
products." According to the release, 
CEI have no plans to move to other 
platforms to the exclusion of the 
Amiga, although they'll still carry mul- 
tiplatform products that are usable with 
other machines beside the Amiga. 

They were hazy about their associa- 
tion with Dell, saying that they had 
"found a lot of common ground to work 
together" but not saying much else, and 
only hinting at future cooperation. 

□ 

CrossDOS 
Update 

I The version of CrossDOS most Ami- 
gans use is the one bundled with 
Workbench 2.1 and above, which is 
not the full package. The new version 
6. Improvements include doubled flop- 
py access speed - none too soon - 
much faster hard disk writes, true MS- 
DOS hard disk partitioning (no Prefor- 
matting on an MS-DOS machine need- 
ed), support for bridgeboard and PC- 
Task diskfiles, network compatibility, 
and considerably enhanced utilities. 
There's full-time phone support in the 
US - from one AM till nine AM, Aus- 
tralian eastern standard time - and 
CrossDOS lists at $US60,^ith up- 
grades available to registered owners 
from Desktop Utilities. 

Contact DTU on (06) 239 6658 for 
more information.

An Amiga 
Future 



I I have multitasked in Windows '95, I 
have Quark Expressed on a Mac, I have 
surfed the net from a DX/66 laptop and 
played multimedia on a quad speed 
drive, I have rendered on a Pentium, I 
have PowerPC 'ed, I have task switched, 
shuffled, and dragged on just about 
every choice brand, but they are all just 
machines. Only one stirred emotion. 
The Amiga. 

Amiga is special. Amiga is freedom. 
Amiga is knowing you can move on 
instead of waiting around for the 
hardware to catch on. Amiga is buying a 
computer in 1991, and in 1995 knowing 
it still outperforms the competition in all 
the departments that matter to you. 
Amiga is knowing you can upgrade, and 
the add ons will really make a 
difference. Amiga is having something 
unique and feeling good about daring to 
be different, and enjoying every ounce 
of sizzle that difference offers you when 
it comes to getting something done. 

For the last year Amiga has also been 
about faith and hope. Many people hung 
in there because the technology might 
be resurrected. They put faith in the 
promises made by would be buyers, and 
hoped that their investment would be 
fruitful again at some time in the future, 

At the end of the dark road we've 
travelled since Commodore was buried 
and the deathbed vigil ended, the new 
world of Amiga is shaping up. It is 
something of a renaissance, a rebirth. 
There are new players and new software 
publishers leading the way as we start to 
rediscover the potential of this grand 
platform. 

Like many companies in the Amiga 
industry, we've stuck it out despite the 
very real possibility of everything 
grinding to a halt. As some of you may 



know, it was in late June last year that 
Amiga Review changed hands. After 
twelve years in the stable of Gareth 
Powell, Amiga Review moved to Storm 
Front Studios. Forking out money for a 
publication facing the possibility of 
extinction may seem foolhardy to some. 
However, I was convinced the Amiga 
would recover and that we could go on 
to do all the things with Amiga Review 
that many of the magazine's greatest 
supporters have only ever dreamed 
about. 

We started with a slight handicap - by 
the time Amiga Review was in our 
control the July issue was running 
horribly late. We should have called it 
August and carried on. However, our 
enthusiasm demanded we at least try to 
bring the publication back on time. This 
later proved impossible, with all the 
variables of editorial, advertising, 
production, reprographics, printing and 
distribution compounding to force us to 
skip an issue in November. 

Despite this, we had managed many 
improvements in the look and size of the 
magazine. Last month's, reader survey 
has helped to pin point many more areas 
where we can improve. We also have 
plans for some very sharp new graphics 
for the magazine, designed by Jarrod 
Pudsey - who currently also creates all 
of our front cover images. From here on 
you can look forward to more 
improvements in the look and content, 
and we'll continue to seek your 
feedback to ensure Amiga Review 
qualifies as your choice in Amiga 
magazines .The Amiga is back and we 
plan to follow this new period of growth 
and change with increased vigour. Roll 
on the Amiga Renaissance.

The clash of the 
image titans 

ImageFX 2.0 vs ImageMaster R/T 
1 .5 vs Art Department Pro 2.5 



By Peter Adams 



I The Amiga has an excellent 
range of image processing soft- 
ware. All of the commercial prod- 
ucts can deliver high quality pro- 
fessional results. 

While Art Department Profes- 
sional (ADPro) from ASDG has 
long been regarded as the lop im- 
age processing package on the 
Amiga, both ImageFX (Nova De- 
sign) and Imagemaster (Black Belt 
Systems) have been vying pretty 
hard for the crown. Coincidentally, 
the latter two packages have re- 
cently had major updates - Image- 
FX 2.0 and Imagemaster R/T 1.5. 
So, without further delay, let's take 
a look at what these updates entail, 
and see how they measure up to 
ADPro 2.5 in a head-to-hcad, win- 
ner takes all contest! 

Screen Layout 

The screen layouts for both Im- 
ageFX and Imagemaster have re- 
mained basically unchanged since 
their last major releases. Both are 
highly configurable, but ImageFX 
goes one better in that you have 
the option of opening it on the 
Workbench screen, just like AD- 
Pro. Re-targeting the display on 
third party 24 bit display card 



screens is supported in both pro- 
grams - with Opal Vis ion and Fire- 
cracker being the common boards. 
ImageFX again has the edge over 
Imagemaster - it also supports 
IV24 and Retina. Neither supports 
the Picasso, Piccolo or EGS Spec- 
trum. ADPro supports the Picasso 
board as well as Opal Vision, 
Retina and Firecracker. All of them 
work on a plain ECS Amiga, too. 

Help Me If You Can! 

Both Imagemaster and Image- 
FX have on-line help. Imagemas- 
ter's on-line help is in hypertext 
format (click a word to see the ref- 
erence...), and it completely sup- 
plants the program manual. Navi- 
gating your way around Image- 
master's help/manual is fairly 
straightforward. The on-line help 
for ImageFX is also in hypertext 
form, but it's nowhere near as 
comprehensive as Imagemaster 's. 
Nova Design state that the Image- 
FX on-line help is there for assis- 
tance - not as a substitute for the 
book manual included with the 
program. ADPro comes with no 
on-line heSp - it just comes with a 
well compiled and hefty manual. 



Loaders and Savers 

Both ImageFX and Imagemas- 
ter have a plethora of loaders and 
savers. Imagemaster has more 
loaders, including CMY and 
CMYK and even Atari's Degas 




ImageFX Original

AMIGA Review 




[Sofgaranre 



if--.-. ^ ■- 



and Neo Chrome formats! Howev- 
er, ImageFX has more saver for- 
mats, including ones for Sun and 
Silicon Graphics formats. All the 
common PC and Mac graphics file 
formats are well provided for in 
both packages. ADPro has quite a 
number of loaders and savers, but 
some of the common PC and MAC 
ones are only available in a module 
which you have to purchase sepa- 
rately. 

Image Operators 

Operators, operators, operators 
- boy, do these programs have im- 
age operators! There really isn't 
that much between ImageFX and 
Imagemaster in the number and 
variety of operators they provide. 
All the usual operators are there - 
cropping, scaling, changing 
palettes and so on - as well as lots 
of special effects such as solarisa- 
tion, motion blur, compositing, 
emboss, antique and more. While 
there are a lot of common opera- 
tors, each program has a few spe- 
cial effects all its own. In this cate- 
gory, ImageFX has the edge over 
Imagemaster - but not by much. 
Worthy of particular attention are 
the ImageFX operators Lens Flare 
Creator and Lightning Bolt Gener- 
ator. 

The Lens Flare Creator allows 
you to add a lens flare to an exist- 
ing image. You can control such 
factors as type of flaTe, light radi- 
us, brightness and artifacts. The 
Lightning Bolt Generator is a bit 
gimmicky but you may find it oc- 
casionally useful... like, um, when 
you want a lightning bolt in your 
picture! 

While random factors are gen- 
erated by the program for the light- 
ning, you can set parameters for el- 
ements such as the type of bolt, the 
number of forks and the glow in- 
tensity, and the results can be quite 
impressive. 

I should also mention that for 
most operator requesters, ImageFX 



includes thumbnail previews to 
show you how the effect is going 
to look - a nice touch! 

So how does ADPro measure 
up to these guys (ImageFX and 
Imagemaster) in the special effects 
department? Not too well really - 
ADPro just doesn't have anywhere 
near the array of special effects op- 
erators of either ImageFX or Im- 
agemaster. 

Painting Tools 

Slip! Slop! Slap! If you want to 
paint on to your images with 
brushes, then both ImageFX and 
Imagemaster can accommodate 
most of your requirements. If 
you're using ADPro and want to 
do a bit of touch up painting on an 
image - tough. ADPro doesn't in- 
clude any painting tools. ASDG 
presumably take the view that 
there are more than enough dedi- 
cated paint packages on the Amiga 
which do a pretty good job. 

But wait! There's more! 

If you think I've just listed all 
the features of ImageFX and Im- 
agemaster, you're seriously mis- 
taken. These packages are jam 
packed with modules including 
morphing, multi-frame and/or mul- 
ti-effects batch processing and sup- 
port for flat bed scanners. Oh, I al- 
most forgot, ARexx is well imple- 
mented in both of them. ADPro al- 
so has an extensive ARexx imple- 
mentation. 

The morphing modules in Im- 
ageFX and Imagemaster are pretty 
similar, and both work well. Cin- 
emorph, which was originally is- 
sued as a stand alone morphing 
program, is now included free with 
ImageFX. There's no morphing 
module in ADPro as such - you 
have to buy a separate program, 
Morph Plus. Morph Plus isn't 
cheap (although it costs less than 
ADPro), but it does have addition- 
al operators, and it integrates ni- 
cely with ADPro.

IrnageFX Dream 



ImageFX LensFlare 



The ImageFX Multi Processor 
(or IMP for short) is a batch con- 
troller for single images, sequential 
images, and animations. Its layout 
and operation are adequate and it 
does have a few in-built scripts. 
Imagemaster 's Multi-Frame Pro- 
cessor incorporates a nice graphi- 
cal film strip layout, but you need 
a good knowledge of ARexx to get 
it to work. ADPro comes with 
FRED (FRame EDitor) which does 
a fair job of multi frame/multi ef- 
fects processing, and comes with 
quite a few ready to use scripts. 

However, for my money, none 
of these batch processors come 
anywhere near the mighty Pro 
Control, which is an add-on mod- 
ule for ADPro. Sure, it costs mon- 
ey (it's moderately priced) - but it's 



worth paying that little extra for a 
batch processor which is so well 
designed, simple to use, and re- 
liable. 

In the scanner department, Im- 
ageFX and Imagemaster both pro- 
vide modules for the Epson range

Updates 

Black Belt Systems regularly 
update Imagemaster. Registered 
users need only send $US25 in or- 
der to receive the latest version. 
Nova Design have recently an- 
nounced a minor upgrade to Im- 
ageFX which will include some 



new special effects (Sparkle and 
Film Grain), blue and green screen 
compositing, and support for the 
new Cybergraphics 24 bit card as 
well as Primera and Picture 310 
colour printers. There haven't been 
any recent update statements about 
ADPro. 

Give me RAM - lots of 
RAM! 

If you're thinking of using any 
of these packages on a twin floppy 
drive A500, forget it! AH of them 
use lots of RAM, need at least a 
68020 processor and have to be in- 
stalled on a hard disk. You can run 
most common functions on a 6Mb 
system, but more complicated spe- 
cial effects require more - 10Mb or

better. Ideally, you need a monster 
accelerated 68040 Amiga with 
enough RAM to choke an ele- 
phant! 

And the winner is... 

Well, it isn't quite that easy - 
all of these programs are winners. 
The most complete package over- 
all is ImageFX - but that doesn't 
mean it couldn't stand a few im- 
provements. 

For instance, it'd be nice to see 
a batch controller as good as Pro 
Control in a future ImageFX up- 
grade. Nevertheless, with a retail 
price of $399.00. ImageFX is very 
good value indeed. 

Irnagemaster, on the other 
hand, isn't far behind ImageFX in 



the features stakes 
and with a retail price 
at around $230.00 is 
also excellent value. 

Finally, ADPro.... 
what can I say. It's 
pluses are that it has 
a good user-friendly 
interface, it performs 
well, and has the ex- 
cellent Pro Control as 
a front end hatch pro- 
cessor. The main 
down side is that you 
have to pay for addi- 
tional features in the 
form of plug- in mod- 
ules - which, in the 
end, will cost you 
more money than the 
all singing, all danc- 
ing, ImageFX. 

The recently 

released Photogenics 
(see the review in the 
April 1995 Amiga 
Review) has set some 
high standards in ter- 
ms of image process- 
ing features and per- 
formance, as well as 
value for money. 
Whilst Photogenics is 
currently designed 
for single image handling on AGA 
machines, it's hoped that future de- 
velopments by Almathera will in- 
corporate multi-frame processing 
features. When it does, things will 
really hot up! 

With the Amiga now getting 
off the floor courtesy of a massive 
electric shock from Escom, com- 
petition among the Amiga image 
processing programs needs to re- 
main fierce in order to ensure that 
interest in the platform is sus- 
tained. 

If that happens, the real win- 
ners will be us consumers!

Get SLIPped with 
MultiLink 



By Adrian DeLuca 



I A quiet revolution is taking place 
among the Amiga Internet users, 
which I think is the best thing 
since sliced bread. What is it, I 
hear you ask? Well, I'll give you 
some background information first. 

If you 're a regular Internet us- 
er, you've no doubt heard the word 
SLIP pop up at some time or an- 
other, and if you know what SLIP 
is, you know it is terribly expen- 
sive. SLIP stands for Serial Line 
Internet Protocol, and allows com- 
puters to be hooked up to the Inter- 
net's TCP/IP protocol through a 
standard serial port - you effec- 
tively become your own node on 
the Internet! 

What makes SLIP so attractive 
is that it delivers the Internet to 
you in your normal desktop envi- 
ronment - in the case of Amiga 
users, the Workbench - instead of a 
boring old UNIX prompt where 
you try to learn all of its cryptic 
commands. 

Many Internet providers are 
now offering SLIP connection to 
their servers for a moderate initial 
connection fee, plus an hourly or 
monthly charge. Some offer a high 
yearly flat rate and give you a lim- 



ited amount of time per day - mind 
you, these servers are most likely 
slow not big on free dial -in lines. 
So if you're a poor old university 
student and can't stretch your bud- 
get to a real SLIP account (like 
me!), but have a plain old shell ac- 
count, then Ezra Story's latesl bril- 
liant invention is for you. What am 
I talking about? Multi Link of 
course! 

Multi Link (abbreviated to 
MLink) is best described as a par- 
tial SLIP emulator for a UNIX 
shell account. It's not an emulator 
strictly speaking, but it's easier to 
think of it as one. MLink is a 
TCP/IP stack protocol just like 
AmiTCP and Commodore's 
AS225 networking package, but it 
uses different routines to commu- 
nicate with your Internet server, 
and is a heck of a lot easier to set 
up! 

MLink is being hailed as an 
outstanding revolution in TCP/IP 
networking by Amigans all over 
the net; it opens a new door to 
shell account users, and best of all 
it available freely from Aminet 
(ftp.wustl.edu) as /comm/tcp/ 
mlinkl.l.lha. 



MLink can be directly com- 
pared to the program TIA (The In- 
ternet Adaptor). TIA is a commer- 
cial product released by Cy- 
berspace Inc, so you'll be paying a 
whole lot of cash for it. Also, TIA 
requires that you have a SLIP 
driver running on the Amiga, 
which means you will have to set 
up AmiTCP. The beauty of MLink 
is that you don't necessarily need 
AmiTCP installed - but it is recom- 
mended. MLink comes in two es- 
sential parts - there's the program 
which runs on the Amiga, and the 
program which runs on your UNIX 
server. It's essential that both these 
programs are put in the right place, 
as they need to send and receive 
data packets from each other. 

Once you've extracted the 
archive, you'll notice a file called 
mlink.tar.gz. This file must be up- 
loaded to your UNIX account and 
extracted with the gzip program. It 
contains the C source for the 
UNIX end of MLink. It is provided 
as source so it can be compiled ac- 
cording to the platform of your In- 
ternet server. I compiled it on a 
DEC platform flawlessly, but com- 
piling it on a Linnix server requires 
a small change in the installation

script. Unfortunately, I didn't 
know this when I first attempted it, 
so a quick chat to some Amigoids 
on the #amiga channel on IRC set 
me back on track, but only to find 
that it was all documented in the 
provided Amigaguide file under 
Troubleshooting (d'oh!). 

After having compiled the 
UNIX MLink end, you're ready to 
configure the Amiga end. Again, 
this is rather simple, as the config- 
uration is done in the tooltypes of 
the MLink icon. The most impor- 
tant thing is to set the average CPS 
rate (Characters Per Second). The 
current version of MLink does not 
support autodetecting the baud 
rate; this will be one of Ezra's im- 
provements in the next release. 

The CPS speed is determined 
by the link you have with your In- 
ternet provider; for example, a 
14.4K link with your Internet 
provider will average 1600 CPS. 
Another important option is the de- 
vice you'll be using to send and re- 
ceive data. This will probably be 
serial. device, although some other 
shareware device drivers such as 
dialer.device and baudbandit seem 
to work fine. 

You'll also need to tell the the 
Amiga side of MLink where the 
UNIX end is located in your direc- 
tory, so you will need to set up the 
path to it. One other important 
piece of information you need to 
know is how your server sends its 
packets of data. Most servers don't 
send 8 -bit clean data over the mo- 
dem; in this case you will have to 
set the ESCAPE bit on MLink, 
which tells it which character not 
to send over the line. Unfortu- 
nately, this is a matter of trial and 
error - you'll have to experiment 
with some characters until you get 
it right - but the MLinLguide of- 
fers a range of possibilities. In my 
particular case, I had to filter out 
the "*". 

Before you can use MLink, you 
need a few of the finest Internet 



clients available on the Amiga. 
Clients are programs which inter- 
act with the Internet connection to 
bring the data through the modem 
and to your screen. Clients have 
simple interfaces which make them 
easier to use than UNIX command 
line programs. 

MLink uses clients made for 
AmiTCP, not for the Commodore 
AS225 networking package; be 
sure that when you're collecting 
new clients that they're made for 
the AmiTCP stack protocol. After 
some experimentation with some 
of AmiTCP's clients, I found that 
most of them didn't work properly 
- but don't despair, the most im- 
portant clients work. If you've al- 
ready established yourself as an In- 
ternet user, you'll know that you 
cannot live without a Worid Wide 
Web browser, an FTP client and 
my favourite, an IRC client, so 
we're off to visit Aminet to pick up 
a few goodies! There are a heap of 
clients available on Aminet in the 
/comm/tcp directory. I've made a 
list of clients that work. 

A-Mosaic 

I consider this the most impor- 
tant of my Internet tools. A-Mosaic 
allows you to surf through the net 
via Worid Wide Web and visit 
some cool international sites, view 
pictures, download files, play 
sounds and, now, even play games! 
If you've ever used NCSA's Mosa- 
ic on Windows or X-Windows, a 
similar version is also available for 
the Amiga. There have already 
been a few versions of A-Mosaic 
released; it's currently up to ver- 
sion 1.3 beta. Aminet only cur- 
rently holds version 1.2, but if you 
want to live on the edge and give 
the beta version a spin, point your 
URL to: http;//insti.physics.sunysb. 
edu/AMosaic/ 

DaFTP 

If you love to download files 
using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) 



then you can't go past DaFTP; it's 
a great FTP client with an intuitive 
GUI rather than the boring com- 
mand line interface offered by 
UNIX shell accounts. DaFTP is 
available for anonymous FTP from 
ftp.warped.com in the /pub/ 
amiga/DaFTP directory. 

GrapeVine 

If IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is 
your game, then Grapevine is the 
way to go. GrapeVine has a very 
intuitive interface and is extremely 
easy to use and set up. I think it's 
the best IRC client on any plat- 
form! GraveVine is also available 
for anonymous FTP at 
ftp.warped.com in the /pub/amiga/ 
gravevine directory. 

GRn 

GRn is a Usenet Newsreader, 
again with a pretty interface. It's 
available on Aminet in the 
comm/news/Grn-2. 11 ha directory. 

GUI-FTP 

Although I much prefer DaFTP, 
GUI-FTP is another GUI based 
FTP client and it works with 
MLink. GUI-FTP is available on 
Aminet in the comm/tcp/Gui- 
Ftp.lha directory. 

AmiTCP-Telnet 

If you have AmiTCP installed, 
you will find that its Telnet client 
works, so you can log onto other 
servers just as you would from 
your normal UNIX account. 

It's not a humungous list, 
but these are the essen- 
tials. 

So where's the Finger, Gopher 
and talk clients I hear you yell? 
Unfortunately, my experiments 
with various other clients proved 
unsuccessful, but this doesn't mean 
you can't use them (or test a few 
yourself). Included in the MLink

archive is a modified version Bf 
AmiTCP's Napsaterni. Napsaterm 
is a VT100 emulator and rlogiii 
client, so you can go back to using 
your UNIX shell and use the clien- 
ts installed on your server. 

Once you've configured MLink 
appropriately and set up all your 
AmiTCP clients, you're ready to 
surf the net with your new Internet 
facelift. As always, you will need 
to run your communication pack- 



age (Term, Terminus, NComm or 
whatever) to dial up to your server; 
once you've initiated all the neces- 
sary login procedures and are fac- 
ing your UNIX prompt, you wilt 
have to set your modem to keep 
carrier so you can exit your com- 
munications package. You can do 
this by typing +++ so you can is- 
sue commands directly to your 
modem, then setting at&dO to keep 
carrier, and then atoO to return to 



your prompt. Now you can safely 
exit your communications package 
and run MLink. 

When you start MLink it opens 
a window showing some very im- 
portant information such as server 
name (you should already know 
that!), elapsed time, bytes sent and 
received, and how many sockets 
you have open and how many 
clients are running. If there were 
any bad packets of data, MLink al- 
so alerts you of bad packet errors. 
Each client opens its own socket, 
and the more sockets you have 
open, the slower the clients will 
run. I also found that MLink's raw 
data transfer is remarkably fast; 
even when you have three or four 
sockets open, MLink's still quite 
bearable. 

I've heard some reports that 
Mlink occasionally crashes, but 
I've not experienced such prob- 
lems in the two weeks of rigorous 
usage I've given the product. I be- 
lieve the problems were contribut- 
ed by the latest beta version of A- 
Mosaic 1.3; if this turns out to be 
the case, just stick to good old ver- 
sion 1.2. It's recommended that 
you have at least 4Mb RAM, espe- 
cially when you like opening heaps 
of clients (like me!). Because 
MLink is does not offer ail the ca- 
pabilities of a SLIP connection, 
you will not be assigned your own 
IP address, which means others 
cannot Telnet or FTP into your ac- 
count. 

Before using MLink on your 
UNIX server, it's a good idea to 
tell your system administrator 
about it; unfortunately some sys- 
tem administrators don't approve. 

So there you have it folks, 
Mlink is definitely a product no 
Amiga Internet shell user should 
live without - 1 know I can't! And 
although it's not a full SLIP con- 
nection, $US15 shareware is a 
heck of a lot better than yearly 
subscription to a SLIP provider!

AMIGA Review 




fotfoedtton. 



Survey time! 

I think it may be time to start 
looking at a reader survey. I'm see- 
ing a bit of a trend which I think is 
worth keeping an eye on. Here in 
the Aust Amiga echo you've tradi- 
tionally received many messages 
accusing you of posting old news, 
and this is frequently true - but on- 
ly {in my humble opinion) if the 
reader has: 

1. Access to Email (preferably 
Internet) 

2. Regular access to numerous 
foreign magazines. 

Now, I was reading Amiga Re- 
view (along with CU Amiga) for 
about 1 years before getting a mo- 
dem and as a mere local reader I 
found the contents of the magazine 
as interesting and relevant as the 
British mag (if not as glossy, etc). 
The real bonus was the local news 
and ads. 

I don't know what portion of 
Amiga Review's readers are still 
modemless but I'd suggest that it 
may well be the majority (personal 
feeling). 

What I'm trying to say is that 
when working on improving the 
magazine content, don't forget 
those who don't have all the know- 
how and info sources of these oth- 
er modemmers. Listen to what's 
being said online, but also find out 
from the actual readers en masse. 

I'd also like to see some inter- 
views with some of our Australian 
Amiga personalities. I'd certainly 
be interested to see a small bio 
about Andrew Farrell, for one, and 
interviews with programmers like 
Jon PotteT, Chris Hames and oth- 



ers. And how about some stories 
about the organisations which are 
using the Amiga? 

I think that we've got to try to 
re-establish the sense of commu- 
nity among Amiga users, which I 
think has been largely lost. 
Adrian Jenkin, 
via FidoNet 

Ed: You want a survey - you 've 
got one (in the May issue)! You're 
right when you say that not many 
people have modems - and an even 
smaller slice of our readership us- 
es online information services. 

We're acutely aware of the dis- 
tortions of apparent reader opinion 
that can happen when you use par- 
ticular methods to gauge what 
your readers want; the denizens of 
the Aust Amiga Fido echo would 
probably be quite proud to be de- 
scribed as abnormal, but even 
putting a survey in the magazine 
only gets you replies from the kind 
of people who fill out surveys 
(whoever they are.,,). 

So we don't set too much stock 
by what we're told by any one 
group of people, let alone any indi- 
vidual. If we did, we'd be in a con- 
stant frenzy of magazine recon- 
struction. That said, feedback's al- 
ways welcome, atid contributes to 
our continuous improvements to 
Amiga Review's content and look. 

We did a few interviews in 
Amiga Review in the olden days 
and could certainly resurrect the 
idea; with the Amiga's new owner- 
ship it looks like there'll be a few 
new success stories for us to docu- 
ment! 

Coverdisk XVIII - The Saga 
Continues 

I love your magazine, but 
would like to point out a few im- 
provements that could be made. 

1) Coverdisk - We all love 
coverdisks. This would just be a 
few games, utilities or maybe a 



demo or two. MUST be 1.3 com- 
patible. If a coverdisk isn't possi- 
ble, how about a subscribers' su- 
perdisk? 

2) Poster - How about a huge 
big rendered picture from the art 
gallery? 

3) Speed - How come the 
newsagent gets Amiga Review one 
and a half weeks sooner than me? 
Sam Haddow, 
KatherineNT 

Ed: Thanks for the support, 
Sam. The coverdisk issue pops up 
again every few months; there are 
a number of reasons why we don't 
do it. One, adding a disk to every 
magazine would mean making 
them considerably more expensive 
- disks cost money, duplication 
costs money, sticking them on costs 
money and shipping mags with 
disks also costs more. Two, we al- 
ready have the Hot PD companion 
disks; if you want them, you order 
them, and if you don't, you don't. 
We sell a lot of them, but not near- 
ly as many disks as magazines. So 
it would appear that "you all" 
don't love coverdisks. 

If we made the companion 
disks 1.3 compatible, we'd be 
missing out on 80% of the new 
utilities and a significant slice of 
the new games. Not many ECS de- 
mos are coming out these days, ei- 
ther; if you want to see the cool 
new stuff, you need an AGA ma- 
chine with OS3! 

The poster idea's an interesting 
one - again, to actually include it 
in the magazine would cost money 
and would leave you with a 
creased poster with staple holes, 
but having posters as a call-if-you- 
want-one proposition as well could 
work. We '11 look into it. 

We addressed the issue of late 
sub copies on the subscriber cover 
sheet a few months back. If you 
want your sub copies to arrive be- 
fore the newsagent copies, you 
have to hold the newsagent copies 



AMIGA Review

back. We thought we could get the 
delivery process slick enough that 
they'd at least arrive at the same 
time, but it's turned out to be im- 
possible. Some big magazines op- 
erate with a lead time of two or 
more months; in a field that 
changes as fast as computing we 
couldn 't do that. 

So we get sub copies from the 
printer at about the same time as 
the distributor, and the distributor 
trucks them out while we mail them 
(which takes a day or so to organ- 
ise), and Australia Post does what- 
ever the heck it likes with them for 
as long as it feels like, and that 's 
why your sub copy 's late. 

A subscription to Amiga Re- 
view (or PC Review, for that mat- 
ter) gives you an assurance of get- 
ting the magazine, plastic wrapped 
in your letterbox, for less than 
you 'd pay at the newsstand. And 
you '11 usually get it just a few days 
later. Bui, unfortunately, that's it. 

Keeping up with the Jone- 
ses 

As an elderly member of the 
Amiga fraternity, I am belatedly 
writing to express my appreciation 
of the members of the team which 
produces the Amiga Review maga- 
zine, and who have for some time 
been sympathetically attentive and 
helpful to my occasional calls for 
help on technical matters - my grey 
matter being literature oriented 
rather than mathematically adept. 
Probably because of this fact, my 
Amiga provides endless opportuni- 
ties to delve into all sorts of fasci- 
nating mental exercises. 

Unfortunately, the rapid devel- 
opment of the science of comput- 
ing is escalating the cost of ma- 
chines and the huge range of allied 
equipment to the point where 
many have to call a halt and make 
the best of their existing setup. 

However, "keeping up" is not 
necessary, as you would be aware. 
There are still a large number of 



people with early vintage machines 
who remain enchanted with the 
range of activities available to 
them. Bells and whistles very often 
are only a different, or perhaps an 
easier way of using the basic po- 
tential of a computer. 

In this regard, may I suggest 
that an occasional article be in- 
cluded in the magazine to help 
those of thus who are plodding 
along in the rear and not altogether 
competent, even with our older 
machines? 

To return to the reason for writ- 
ing, I look forward to the monthly 
arrival of my copy of Amiga Re- 
view, and the wide range of articles 
by knowledgeable authors which 
keep me in touch with the world of 
the Amiga. I particularly enjoy An- 
drew's scholarly approach and 
Daniel's bright and breezy and 
sometimes irreverent writing, 
which is a joy to read. 
BillPovey, 
Frenchs Forest NSW 

Ed: Thanks for the complimen- 
ts, Bill. We appreciate that most 
people don't have cutting-edge 
hardware; fortunately, Amiga soft- 
ware is generally quite friendly to 
older machines and so anyone run- 
ning, say, an ECS chipset machine 
with a hard drive of modest pro- 
portions, a couple of megs of RAM 
and Workbench 2 (this sort of set- 
up can be bought second hand for 
under $1000) can run most new 
Amiga programs - sure, not as fast 
or in as many colours as owners of 
newer machines, but quite usably. 

We disagree that prices are es- 
calating - sure, you'll spend a for- 
tune if you want to stay on the cut- 
ting edge, but when you consider 
the multi-kilobuck price of the 
original 256k, 68000 powered 
floppy -only A 1000 would now get 
you a firebreathing monster with 
megabytes of RAM, hundreds of 
megabytes of hard disk space and 
a processor better than 40 times 



faster, you can hardly complain 
about the trend in bangs for bucks. 
Remember, the computer on your 
desk is as powerful as the ones 
which, back in the valve days, 
some people thought would have to 
be built in orbit or they 'd collapse 
under their own unimaginable 
weight! 

It's the nature of the computer 
business that everything becomes 
obsolete very quickly, but the old 
maxim stands - if your computer 
does a job today, it'll do it in a 
year. The problem is, people keep 
finding new jobs they want done.

Nice try 

Tammy Marks of Casino, 
NSW, was watching the midday 
movie on Prime, which happened 
to be "The Preppie Murder". It fea- 
tured a whole computer shop, with 
an Amiga box in full view in the 
shop window behind the actors. 

Tammy went on to say "I won't 
suck up for a free sub because I 
have seen that it will get me 
nowhere and just degrade me." 
Nice try, nice try. But it won't 
work with just one spotting. 

Music piracy 

Somebody who left their name 
off their letter - a fact we missed at 
the time of throwing the envelope 
away - spotted an A 1200 on Ten 
Capital's morning news. In an in- 
terview with Tommy Emmanuel 
about the recent Internet music 
piracy media beat-up, there was a 
shot of an A 1200 with a 1942 
monitor, which we suppose was 
meant to be in the middle of the 
three day download you'd need to 
do with a 28,800 modem to rip off 
a whole CD. With regular Internet 
speed from popular sites, a whole 
CD would probably take about two 
weeks. But we digress. 

Whoever the somebody is then 
asked if he or she was due any free 
stuff for the sighting - yes! You've 
won a NEW CAR! Collectable at 
any time before this magazine goes 
to press! 

Ausnet hack 

While we're on things Internet- 
ty, Stephen Turner was watching 
the ABC news on April 18th and 
saw a piece on the theft of credit 
card numbers from the Ausnet In- 
ternet provider. Some Internet con- 
sultant/expert type was inter- 
viewed, and on the desk behind 
him was an A 1200, Stephen of 
course went on to beg for a free 
subscription, and we are of course 
going on lo not give it to him. 



The same spotting was also 
sent in by Ian Ballantyne of Bris- 
bane, Old, who saw presumably 
the same guy and same computer 
on Channel 7's 11 AM program on 
the 19th of April. Ian claimed first 
dibs because he rang right after he 
saw it. However, Ian seemed mys- 
teriously unable to recall the name 
of the person he talked to, so we're 
seizing on this and the later date as 
the excuses we'll use to make sure 
his requested extension to his cur- 
rent subscription doesn't happen. 

Joel Cholakians of Doveton, 
Vic, also spotted the 11 AM 
Amiga, and saw another 1200 with 
a 1940 series monitor on the late 
night channel 1 news on the 20th, 
while they were interviewing 
someone suspected of being the 
hacker. 

Not Blackadder 

Rowen Atkinson (who speci- 
fies he's not the famous one) spot- 
ted a credits listing for Amiga 
graphics in an SB S Anzac day spe- 
cial on the battle of Long Tan. The 
graphics weren't anything special - 
probably a DPaint job. Rowen 
went on to spin the usual sob story 
about being a poor student far from 
home blah blah gizza free sub- 
scription. Cry us a river. 

Oh dear oh dear 

And that was it. It looks like 
nobody this month came up with 
anything all that amazing in the 
spottings department. Hey, nobody 
said we HAD to give away a sub 
every month! 

Now that all you folks have 
seen the unchallenging calibre of 
your competition, feel free to send 
in your own attempts for merciless 
destruction at the hands of Amiga 
Review's equivalent of Bernard 
King. G'wan, we dare you.

1200 expansion questions 

At present I'm using an A1200 
with 4Mb fast RAM, a 420Mb IDE 
hard drive and an NEC 3D moni- 
tor. I have some questions concern- 
ing new 1200 expansions and 
memory management. 

1. What is the difference in 
memory speed when comparing 
fast RAM (SIMMS) to Virtual 
Memory? In particular, how would 
a SCSI-2 hard drive, set up and 
connected to a MMU (Memory 
Management Unit) equipped ex- 
pansion board perform against 
SIMMS? 

2. Would a SCSI-2 drive con- 
nected via the PCMCIA port be us- 
able for virtual memory? 

3. Which will run faster, a SC- 
SI-2 from the PCMCIA port or a 
SCSI-2 linked directly to a suitably 
equipped expansion board? 

I was also hoping to find out 
what software is currently 
available to access standard Kodak 
"Photo CD discs (apart from the 
Zappo drive featured in the Octo- 
ber 1994 edition). What type of 
CD-ROM is required? 

I have not missed a single 
Amiga Review in at least 3 years. 
Thanks for your committed Amiga 
support. 
Greg Howden, 
Upwey Vic 

DrHelp: The speed difference 
between virtual and real RAM is 
huge. The access time for your av- 
erage modern SIMM (which, by 



the way, stands for Single Inline 
Memory Module and is just one 
way of packaging the actual RAM 
chips for easy handling) is 70 
nanoseconds - 70 billionths of a 
second. The access time for a rea- 
sonably quick hard drive, like the 
one you're running, is around 10 
milliseconds - 10 thousandths of a 
second. 

Fortunately, thanks to clever 
coding virtual memory is not the 
140,000 times slower these num- 
bers would seem to indicate. But 
it's still slow. The actual perfor- 
mance does depend on the speed of 
your hard drive and controller, and 
on the software you're using 
(GigaMem is the most popular 
Amiga package, but there are a 
couple of freely distributable alter- 
natives). 

Connecting a SCSI drive via a 
Squirrel SCSI interface in the 
PCMCIA port (the only way you 
can do it through that port at pre- 
sent) will be noticeably slower 
than doing it with a trapdoor port 
SCSI-2 controller. This is because 
the Squirrel jusi isn't a very fast 
controller - and it's only SCSI-1, 
which doesn't really matter unless 
you start getting into the very 
heavy hardware or wanting to con- 
nect more than seven devices to it. 
SCSI-2 devices work fine on SCSI- 
1 controllers, and you can use any- 
hard drive for virtual memory. 

For playing with Photo CDs, 
you need a Photo CD compatible 
drive, preferably with multisession 
compatibility as well. These days, 
this means just about every drive. 
Multisession allows you to use 
Photo CDs that have been written 
to several times - if you don't have 
it, you can only access the first 
batch of images. 

There are a number of pro- 
grams that can deal with Photo 
CD discs - if you get the Asimware 
CD filesystem, a commercial prod- 
uct that you could get bundled with 
your drive, you '11 also get a decent 



Photo CD loader and converter 
supporting all resolutions. All the 
big image processing packages al- 
so load Photo CD. 

Upgrading an A600 

Congratulations on the maga- 
zine - I've just subscribed, keep up 
the good work! 

I own an A600HD with a 
120Mb drive, with Kickstart and 
Workbench 2.05. 

1. Do all A600s and A1200s 
come with the 2.5 inch IDE socket 
and mounting bracket for an inter- 
nal HD? 

2. While installing my new 
hard disk (the old one was the 
original 40Mb), I noticed that the 
only chip on the motherboard in a 
socket (not soldered directly to the 
board) had these markings: 

9230 

MX23C4100-1006 

cI992 COMMODORE AMIGA 

V2.05 (37.50) 391304-02 

Am I correct in thinking that 
this is the Kickstart chip? Do I 
need a 2.1 chip to run Workbench 
2.1? Does the Datatypes capability 
come with 2.1, and where can I get 
the disks and manuals - there don't 
seem to be any in stock in WA. 
How much is it likely to be? 

3, Will the OS 3.1 chip fit in 
my A600? Is it worth the money? 

4, I've seen the Squirrel Fast 
PCMCIA SCSI Interface adver- 
tised, and was wondering - can any 
extra memory be fitted to the 
Squirrel? Is there anything else 
that uses the SCSI interface other 
than CD-ROMs, HDs and scan- 
ners? 

Ian Colson, 
Edgewater WA 

Dr Help: 600s and 1200s nor- 
mally have the hard drive bracket - 
but if the machine came with no 
drive, it might not have had a 



20 



AMIGA Review 




bracket. There were about a billion 
brackets for sale at the Com- 
modore Australia auction in one 
big box, which someone snapped 
up for a few tens of dollars, so if 
you're short a bracket there are 
hundreds of them out there... some- 
where... 

The socketed chip is indeed the 
Kickstart, and you '11 be pleased to 
know that you don't need to up- 
grade it to use Workbench 2.1, 
which is just a software upgrade. 
But, as you 've noticed, you '11 have 
to look high and low to find a 2.1 
upgrade pack. If you can find one, 
it'll set you back maybe $100, if 
that. And you can't fit the Work- 
bench 3 ROM, so forget that idea. 

You can't fit any RAM to the 
Squirrel. And the only other com- 
mon type of hardware that uses 
SCSI, if you don 't count removable 
drives, is tape backups, 

CD Confusion 

I and a few of my associates 
are confused by the ads in Amiga 
Review about CD-ROM drives and 
their use with the Amiga. 

A recent visit to Hong Kong in- 
dicated to me that the future of the 
floppy disk is anything but secure - 
it was almost impossible to find 
software on floppy for Amiga or 
PC. 

The current Amiga Review's 
full of references to caddies, dou- 
ble and single spin and so on - 
what's it all mean? 

The most confusing issue is 
what goes with what - A50O CD- 
ROMs plug in the side, A2000 
ones go in the SCSI port... what 
about a bit of a steer? 
R. W.Atwood 
Secretary, Bundaberg 
Commodore-Amiga Computer 
Users' Group 

Dr Help: The only Amiga soft- 
ware I've seen on CD so far is PD 
and shareware stuff, and 



CD32/CDTV titles. But you're 
right about the IBM situation - be- 
cause CDs are far cheaper, more 
convenient and faster than a 
mountain of floppy disks, they're 
becoming very popular indeed. 

Now, a quick breakdown on 
CD-ROM jargon. The "spin" thing 
refers to the speed of the drive, and 
you can also say "speed" instead. 
Single spin drives transfer 150 
kilobytes per second, and are the 
slowest you can get; nobody makes 
them any more, and if you find one 
it'll be dirt cheap. Double speed 
drives are 300Kls, the old stan- 
dard; triple speed drives are 
450Kls and quite rare, and quad 
speed is the current fast standard 
and shifts 600K/s. NEC have re- 
cently come out with a sextuple 
speed drive they thankfully call the 
6X, and that moves a mighty 
900Kls. 

Caddy drives keep their discs 
in plastic holders - the Amiga 
CDTV takes caddies. On the plus 
side, a disc in a caddy is hard to 
damage. On the minus side, you 
need a lot of caddies or you'll be 
shuffling discs in and out of them 
all the time, which increases the 
chance that you'll scratch one - 
and CD-ROMs are a lot less toler- 
ant of scratches than audio CDs. 

The other way to load discs in- 
to a CD-ROM drive is with a tray, 
like the ones on audio CD players. 
There's more dust and more chance 
of damaging the disc, but it's more 
convenient. 

You '11 use a SCSI controller for 
just about any Amiga CD-ROM 
drive - you can use one of the 
cheap Tandem IDE controller 
cards if you want to use a cheaper 
IDE CD-ROM (or you can try to 
get it working from the built in 
A1200 or A40Q0 IDE controller), 
but if you 've already got a SCSI 
controller, as most serious Ami- 
gans have, it's cheaper to get a SC- 
SI drive. 

A500 SCSI controllers go in the 



left side expansion port. A2000 
and A4000 ones go in the internal 
expansion slots. The A3000's got 
SCSI built in, but if you want a 
faster controller (not necessary for 
CD-ROM) you can put a card in a 
3000 too. The A 1200 can take a 
SCSI interface gizmo in the PCM- 
CIA port on the left side, or for 
more speed (again, lost on CD- 
ROM) you can use one of the trap- 
door expansion boards with a SCSI 
option, which put the SCSI port in 
the extra panel hole at the back 
right corner. 

CDTV questions 

I recently purchased a CDTV, 
with keyboard, infra-red joy pad 
and an OLD Commodore floppy 
drive. I'm led to believe that the 
CDTV has 2Mb chip RAM, some 
provision for a hard drive and uses 
WB1.3 ROMs. Am I correct? 

Can I fit Workbench 2 ROMs 
to the CDTV? 

Can 1 fit a 40Mb Quantum SC- 
SI hard drive - and if so, how? 

Can I get a mouse for the 
CDTV? 

Can I "Parnet" the CDTV to 
my A2000 and use the CD drive as 
a drive for my 2000? 

Could you tell me if anybody 
might have copies of CDTV manu- 
als, etc? 
Greg West, 
CalwellACT 

Dr Help: The CDTV has 1Mb 
of chip RAM. You can put a hard 
drive into it if you get a CDTV SC- 
SI interface card; your old Quan- 
tum drive should work fine, but 
you won't be able to mount it in- 
side - only a 2.5 inch drive will fit 
there. 

You can plug a mouse into a 
CDTV; there was a wireless model 
sold by Commodore, and another 
way of doing it is to scare up a 
CDTV trackball such as the one 
Andrew Farrell owns and prizes, 



AMIGA Review 



21 




which has a couple of standard 
nine pin sockets on the side and 
communicates with the CDTV via 
infrared or cable. The trackball it- 
self of course, can replace a 
mouse. 

You can't upgrade a CDTV to 
Workbench 2, but you certainly 
can Par net it to another machine. 

A500 tweaking 

I have Tecently been upgrading 
my A500. I have an 8362 Denise 
chip and want to upgrade to a Su- 
per Denise 8373; is it worth it? 
What advantages are there? Will 
most of my 1.3 software work? 

I have a Fat Agnus 8370 and 
want to upgrade to a 2Mb 8375B. 
Can this be used on an A500, or 
will I have to get a 1Mb 8372A in- 
stead? What advantages are there 
in getting this? Is it worth it? Will 
my software work with it? 
M. Leung, 
Marrickville NSW 

The Super Denise will let you 
use super high res and productivity 
graphics modes. Super high res 
isn't very useful - it lets you do 
1280x256 or 1280x512 interlaced 
without overscan and the only real 
application anyone's found for it is 
video titling. 

Productivity is better - it's 
31.5kHz instead of the usual 
15kHz, and gives you a flicker free 
high resolution display - in only 
four colours from a limited palette. 
But hey, it's the only way you're 
going to get flicker-free high res 
from your machine without a flick- 
er fixer. Of course, you need a mul- 
tiscan or VGA monitor to view 
31.5kHz modes, and a VGA moni- 
tor won't work with 15kHz modes. 
Virtually no old software should 
have a problem with the Super 
Denise. 

You can 't easily fit a 2Mb Ag- 
nus to a 500. There are 2Mb 
boards and hardware hacks to get 
one in, but it's inelegant and if you 



need 2Mb of chip RAM you should 
go to a better machine anyway, be- 
cause applications that need lots of 
chip RAM also need lots of stor- 
age, processor speed and other 
RAM. 

Fitting a 1Mb Agnus is not 
nearly so tricky, though; you just 
plug it in and do a couple of minor 
modifications to your motherboard 
so that a 512K RAM expansion in 
your trapdoor port becomes the 
other 512K of chip RAM. 

If you're not confident with 
hacking around inside your ma- 
chine, turn the job over to someone 
who is (the usual disclaimers apply 
■ if you electrocute yourself or 
toast your computer, I have no in- 
terest in your predicametU). If you 
don 't know how to open your A5 00, 
don 't do this. 

First, physically putting the 
new Agnus in requires taking the 
old one out, for which you need ei- 
ther a PLCC extractor tool 
(available from electronics stores) 
or a small pointy object like a jew- 
eller's screwdriver and patience. 
Make sure you put he new one in 
so the bevelled corner of the chip 
is in the same corner of the socket 
- the two Agnuses don't have the 
writing printed on them the same 
way around, so don 't use that as a 
guide! 

Find the jumper pad labelled 
JP2 (between the CPU and the 
Kicks tart ROM) and cut the trace 
between the bottom and centre 
pads with a sharp knife. Solder the 
top and centre pads together. 

Now, if your A500 has a Revi- 
sion 5 motherboard (the revision 
number's printed on the board), 
find the RAM Expansion Bus Con- 
nector, labelled CMX. Pins 1 and 2 
are on the bottom row and pins 55 
and 56 on the top row. Count up 
from the bottom (by twos), and lo- 
cate Pins 41 and 42. About 1/8" to 
the left is a plated hole with a trace 
which runs straight up, parallel 
with the white line describing the 



CNX connector outline. This trace 
connects pin 32 of CNX to pin 32 
of the Gary chip. Cut it. Be careful 
not to cut the other trace which 
runs parallel to this trace - the oth- 
er trace may be under the printed 
outline of the CNX connector. 

If your A500 has a Revision 6 
board, all you have to do is locate 
the JP7a jumper, in the same loca- 
tion as the abovementioned trace, 
and cut the connection between 
two of the three pads. 

Again, if you've got an old Rev 
5 A500, you now have to do some- 
thing more annoying. Pin 41 of the 
new Agnus has to be out of contact 
with the socket terminal, which for 
the Rev 5 means you have to put a 
sliver of plastic in between it and 
the socket (fiddly but most elegant) 
or bend the connector pin in the 
socket out (ugly but easy - you can 
grab onto it with the hook on the 
end of the abovementioned PLCC 
extractor which I recommend you 
buy). You can wire in a switch to 
toggle between PAL and NTSC 
modes if you like, which can be 
VERYfiddly. 

By the way, the pins are num- 
bered counterclockwise, starting in 
the middle of the top edge, when 
the bevelled corner is at the top 
left. The bevelled corner has pin 11 
on one side and pin 12 on the oth- 
er. There are 84 pins in total. 

Again, Rev 6 owners are better 
off; just cut the trace between the 
pads of jumper JP4, or wire a 
switch to them for toggling video 
mode. 

Having 1Mb of chip RAM is 
useful - you can open more screens 
at once with more colours, digitise 
longer sound samples, and work 
with bigger pictures and anima- 
tions. Some old software does fail 
to work with 1Mb chip RAM, but 
nothing remotely recent does. And 
remember - if you're not confident 
with poking around inside the ma- 
chine, get someone who is to do it.

What's new 
in modems? 



By Daniel Rutter 












► In recent months every computer 
magazine - and rather a lot of mag- 
azines that don't have anything to 
do with computers at all - has leapt 
joyously onto the information su- 
perhighway bandwagon. 

Thousands of column inches 
have been devoted to explanations 
and exclamations of and on what 
the new. on-line world will do to 
and for you. Even we have given 
in to temptation and run a few arti- 
cles on the subject. 

But one thing we're acutely 
aware of, and you probably are 
too, is that most people can't get 
within a mile of online information 
services. Why not? Simple - they 
don't have a modem. 

We ran a big feature on 
modems more than a year ago, and 
everything in it still stands, except 
for one important point - 14,400 
Bps is no longer the highest speed. 

19,200 Bps modems have been 
around for some time, but they've 
never got too popular, because 
they're not that much faster than 
14,400; 19,200 has traditionally 
been a bonus that comes along 
with more spectacular features like 
voice technology. 



The big news is that 28,800 
Bps modems are now commonly 
available, and reasonably priced - 
about a hundred bucks more than a 
14,400. Australia is no longer the 
comms backwater it used to be - 
we now get the new technology 
approved and perfectly legal rea- 
sonably quickly, with a wide 
choice of brands and decent prices. 

Brilliant, I hear you say. Pay a 
quarter more, get twice the speed! 
Where do I sign? 



The downside 

Unfortunately, it's not as sim- 
ple as it sounds (there's a first). 
You see, a number of companies 
jumped the gun with their 28,800 
models. Before the official V.34 
protocol was ratified by the CC1TT 
(see Modem Mumbo Jumbo at the 
end of this article for an explana- 
tion of this and all the other jar- 
gon), there was an unofficial, less 
well defined protocol which the 
CCITT called Vfast (or V.FC). 

All of the modems produced 
before V.34 are Vfast; some are 
upgradable to V.34, and some 
28,800 modems support both sys- 



tems. But V.fast is not compatible 
with V.34, and vice versa. 

If you're trying to connect the 
one to the other, forget it; the best 
you can hope for is a 19,200 Bps 
V.32ter connection (better than a 
poke in the eye, but not what you 
paid for), and if one of the modems 
doesn't support even that then wel- 
come back to 14,400, have a nice 
day. 

As things stand at the moment, 
most 28,800 equipped online ser- 
vices are using V.fast. At the time 
of writing, Australia had 196 bul- 
letin board systems with V.fast 
modems, against a lousy 13 with 
V.34s. The big boards are starting 
to get V,34s to go with their 
V.fasts, but it won't happen 
overnight. 

If you've got to have the new 
technology now, get a modem that 
supports both standards, or one 
that can be upgraded from V.fast to 
V.34. Alternatively, you could sit 
back and see if V34 takes over, as 
it ought to since it's rather more 
official. Remember, the lovely 
thing about computer hardware is 
the longer you prevaricate, the less 
you end up paying.

Special Amiga 
considerations 

28,800 Bps is a big leap from 
14,400, and you need to set the se- 
rial port speed higher accordingly. 
The first serial speed available to 
you above 19,200 Bps is 38,400 
Bps, which gives you some head- 
room for compressed data. 

You see, the serial port speed 
sets the maximum speed at which 
the modem can pump data to the 
computer. Now, a 28,800 Bps mo- 
dem can only transfer 28,800 bits 
every second to another 28,800 
Bps modem, but with compression 
this 28,800 Bps can, theoretically, 
blow out to 115,200 Bps being sent 
down the serial cable. 

This won't happen, for two rea- 
sons. The minor reason is that flow 
control and framing data - stuff 
modems use to tell each other what 
they're sending and when - re- 
duces the actual user data transfer 
rate. The major reason is that only 
a file composed of lots of repeats 
of just one character will compress 
to the maximum four-times rate. 
Plain text will compress quite well, 
but where the transfer rate really 
matters is in uploads and down- 
loads, and just about anything up- 
loaded or downloaded will already 
be compressed; the modem com- 
pression will make little difference. 

But why not just set the modem 
speed to 57,600 ot even 115,200 
Bps, just in case? Go ahead, try it. 
You'll see. 

Unfortunately, the basic Amiga 
architecture, while it is a master- 
piece of multitasking and autocon- 
fig design, is not perfect. It has a 
good serial port built in, but not a 
great one by modern standards, 
and pushing it to 38,400 is ap- 
proaching the red line. You can do 
57,600 in a pinch, but even then a 
standard Amiga starts dropping 
characters, as data comes in faster 
than the computer can suck it out 
of the serial port buffer. 

If you're using a 68000 based 



Amiga (standard A1000, A500, 
A600, A2000), even 19,200 will 
put a big strain on the machine. It 
varies depending on the priority 
you assign your comms program to 
and the serial device you use 
(baudbanditdevice is a good low 
overhead basic serial device; you 
can find it on any decent BBS), but 
a 14,400 Bps download will, gen- 
erally speaking, make a 68000 ma- 
chine crawl, and a 28,800 transfer 
will probably get a lousy transfer 
rate, as the processor stumbles to 
keep up with the data flow and lots 
of resends happen. 

Owners of accelerated ma- 
chines will have less trouble, but 
while you're doing a high speed 
transfer it's likely that anything 
that gloms processor time - access- 
ing hard drives with some con- 
trollers, for example - will trigger 
transfer errors. The faster you set 
your serial, the touchier it'll be. 

If you've got a decent third 
party serial board, you can forget 
these problems. High speed serial 
ports with big buffers bring you up 
to speed, so to speak, with high 
powered IBM compatibles. Gee, it 
only took 'em ten years. 

What the heck is a voice 
modem, anyway? 

Essentially, a modem with 
"voice capability" can handle voice 
messages as well as digital data, so 
it can be used as an answering ma- 
chine, storing messages in its own 
memory or on its host computer's 
hard drive. Sophisticated software 
lets you dial in from somewhere 
else and hear your messages, just 
as with a good answering machine, 
and spiffy products like Net- 
comm's Electronic Secretary (for 
the PC, I'm afraid) even do things 
like letting you store faxes along 
with your messages, and redirect 
them to a fax machine anywhere 
else. The voice recording part, 
though, is what most people mean 
when they talk about voice 



modems. But "voice" covers a col- 
lection of associated technologies, 
too. 

Voice/data switching is the sim- 
plest way of integrating speech and 
data. It lets you use the one line for 
voice and data, but not at the same 
time. Recent modems and fancy 
terminal programs (for computers 
other than the Amiga) are provid- 
ing more elegant ways of switch- 
ing between voice and data, but 
you can do it with any modem. 

The nice new modems, using 
what's called Voice View, can auto- 
matically establish a connection in 
the middle of a regular phone call, 
when the callers want to exchange 
some data. The file's sent and the 
modems switch back to voice, 
without any mucking about on the 
part of their users. 

If you don't have a Voice View 
modem (only Hayes makes 'em so 
far), you have to do it the harder 
way. To go from voice to data, run 
terminal programs at each end, 
send an ATD (dial) command to 
one modem and an ATA (answer) 
to the other, and hang up the voice 
phones. To go back to voice, just 
pick up the phones on the modems 
and hang the modems up by send- 
ing an ATH. The precise handling 
of the switching varies depending 
on whether you've got your phone 
in parallel or connected to a phone 
out on the back of the modem, but 
it's not rocket science in any case. 

Simultaneous voice and data 
modems are way more sophisticat- 
ed. They allow you to talk to 
someone as you exchange files - an 
excellent remote conferencing sys- 
tem. The transfer rate isn't, of 
course, as good as it would be 
without the voice data being sent 
too, but it's pretty impressive any- 
way. These modems come in digi- 
tal and analog flavours; the digital 
ones compress the voice data, al- 
lowing higher transfer rates, but 
they cost more. Neither type is 
supported by any Amiga software.

Dynalink 1428VQE 

Dynalink's ads admit what a lot of 
people think - all modems are pretty 
much the same. 

But the ancillaries can be nice - 
Dynalink's biggest claim to fame is 
that their modems come with Bit Ware

that knocks the socks of the cutdown 
kiddy software you get with many 
modems. For Amiga users, the long

Netcomm 's an Australian company 
that builds solid, stylish, practically in- 
distinguishable units that inhabit the 
higher price bracket. The one we tested 
was the E34F. which is Netcomm' s 
standard V.34 modem (no V.Fast com- 
patibility) with all the usual knobs on, 
including fax. This is Netcomm's 
cheap V.34 modem - it's got the same 



Simplemodem 288f 

Those cunning boys at Simplecomput- 
ing have done it again - we thought it 
was pretty remarkable when they shoe- 
horned 14,400 Bps guts into one of 
their sleek little cases (which, nonethe- 
less, still have a decent suite of indica- 
tor lights) - now they've got V.34 
28,800 Bps operation into one too! 
The only thing wrong with the Simple- 
modems is that their built-in speaker is 



a little plugpack or by a 9 volt battery, 
which when fitted with a special adap- 
tor clip just plugs right into the back of 
the modem. Of course, to get this small 
you have to make some sacrifices. You 
only get 14,400 Bps operation (with all 
the other trimmings), and there's no 
status LEDs. But c'mon, don't YOU 
want a modem you can lose down the- 
side of the couch?

Dynalink are selling their 1428VQE a

The best of the rest... 



Here are a few other modems 
worthy of note. We didn't get the 
chance to test them for this com- 
parison, but you should check 
them out as you shop around. 

Maestro Executive 288 FM 

Maestro 's an Australian com- 
pany that has a record for produc- 
ing decently built gear at good 
prices - Maestros were cheap long 
before Netcomm and Banksia 
dropped their prices. The 288 FM is 
the company's current flagship 
model, and it ditches the old trape- 
zoidal case (that looked pretty 
swish ten years ago...) for a sleek, 
curvy box that can sit vertically on 
a stand if you want. It's a V.Fast 
modem (no V.34 as yet) with all 
the usual features, and sells with 
the usual average software for 
$499. 

Contact Maestro on (02) 242 
9755. 

US Robotics Courier 28,800 

US Robotics modems only got 
Austel approval comparatively re- 
cently, so you haven't been able to 
legally use them in Australia for 
very long. Lots of people bought 
them from the States and used 
them illegally prior to this, because 
they were good and cheap, if, ah, 
funny looking. Oh, all right, they 
look like a Stylophone, OK? 

Unfortunately the approval pro- 
cess seems to have jacked up the 
price - one of the USR Sportster 
14,400 modems will set you back 
an uninspiring $449, while the 
V.Fast/V.FC Courier (some have 
both standards, older models are 
easily upgraded) cost a whopping 
$999. Shame. 

Contact Data Direct on (03) 
210 3330 for more information. 



Spirit Viper 

The Spirit brand was put under 
something of a cloud by the old 
Spirit n 14,400 modem, which had 
a rather individual take on the 
communications standards it was 
supposed to adhere to and wasn't 
even especially cheap. 

But the Viper has redeemed the 
marque, with a Rockwell chipset 
like most of the other modems on 
the market and excellent V.34 
compatibility. 

It'll cost you $599, but it's a 
decent unit; you can get Spirit 
modems from lots of places but try 
Dick Smith Electronics on (02) 
888 3200. 

MicroFax range 

Microfax is another Australian 
company, a new venture that pro- 
duces a range of models at differ- 
ent prices and speeds that all share 
some innovative features, You can 
plug a printer cable straight into 
the modem with no PC, wire the 
modem to the phone line and re- 
ceive faxes. 

You can store up to four 
megabytes worth of faxes (15 
pages) in the Microfax unit, for lat- 
er upload to a computer or printer. 
You can easily send text faxes 
from a PC without fax software, by 
just sending them straight to the 
modem with the word FAX and the 
number at the beginning. 

You can have the Microfax 
redirect stored faxes to another 
number. And they do fax and data 
switching as well. 

We hope to have a review of a 
Microfax soon; in the meantime, 
call Microfax on (02) 918 3099.

t 






Asynchronous - The old sys- 
tem for sending data, originally 
developed for use with the telex 
system. In asynchronous trans- 
mission, each data character 
(byte) is bracketed with control 
bits - a start bit and a stop bit, as 
they're called. This is less effi- 
cient and more prone to errors 
than synchronous transmission 
(q.v.), but it's easier to imple- 
ment. 

Baud rate - From the name of 
the French inventor J. M. Emile 
Baudot, baud rate is the number 
of discrete signals or data sym- 
bols transmitted per second. In 
Baudot's day (he died in 1903) 
baud rate related to telegraph 
transmissions, but it's survived 
as a measure of modem speed. 
Baud rate is frequently used as if 
interchangeable with Bps, but 
it's not. If the modulation system 
a modem uses sends more than 
one bit of data in each signal it 
sends, it can have a lower baud 
rate than its Bps. For example, 
early 1200 and 2400 Bps 
modems both operated at 600 
baud, but the 1200 Bps modem 
signals each carried two bits, 
and the 2400 Bps signals had 
four bits each. 

Bps - Bits per second, the unit 
used for describing modem 
speed. Contrast "baud rate". 

CCITT - The Comite Consultat- 
if International de Telegraphique 
et Telephonique, or International 
Telegraph and Telephone Con- 
sultative Committee, for non- 
French speakers. This interna- 
tional organisation, a division of 
the United Nations' Internation- 
al Telecommunications Union, 
exists to recommend global 
standards for communications. 
The CCITT V.xx standards al- 
low makers of modems to be 
sure that their products will 
work with those from other 
manufacturers - provided both 



parties have interpreted the stan- 
dards the right way. The second 
version of any CCITT standard 
is always called V.xxbis, where 
xx is the standard number; the 
third version is always called 
V.xxter. Why? More French. 

Download - To receive a tile 
from another computer on your 
computer, via a modem or null 

modem cable. 

Duplex - This is computers- 
peak for sending information 
both ways. If you can only send 
information one way via a given 
system, it's called a simplex 
connection - like, for example, a 
pneumatic tube that can only 
suck message capsules one way. 
A half-duplex connection can 
send information both ways, but 
not both ways at once; this is 
like a pneumatic tube that can 
suck a message either way, de- 
pending on which way you set a 
switch. A full duplex connection 
can send data both ways at once, 
like two tubes next to each oth- 
er; in the olden days of modems 
this was done with four separate 
wires making two distinct cir- 
cuits, but modern modems are 
smart enough to do it on one cir- 
cuit 

Fallback - If a modem can't 
use its maximum speed, because 
the modem at the other end 
doesn't support it or because the 
line's too noisy, fallback allow it 
to select a lower speed mode. 

Leased line - Consumer mo- 
dem equipment runs on the pub- 
lic phone network. But big com- 
panies which need superfast, 
highly secure, very reliable con- 
nections between their physical- 
ly separated parts use leased 
lines. These are separate from 
the phone system, without any 
exchanges or other switching 
systems, and are very expensive 
from the point of view of the av- 



erage consumer. But with a 
leased line system you can use 
modems that put out signals that 
aren't allowed on the ordinary 
phone system. 

MNP - Microcom Networking 
Protocol is a communications 
protocol developed by the Mi- 
crocom company and used by 
lots of other people. Microcom 
have, so far, come up with five 
classes of this system. MNP 
class 1 (abbreviated MNP 1) 
sends data one way at a time. 
MNP 2 sends data both ways at 
once. MNP 3 achieves slightly 
faster transfers, by not sending 
start and stop bits between 
modems. MNP 4 sends larger 
blocks of data on cleaner lines, 
which increases throughput, and 
drops back to smaller blocks on 
noisy lines so that when errors 
happen less data will have to be 
sent again. This tactic is also 
used by the good file transfer 
protocols, like ZModem. 

Null modem cable • A cable 
wired so that when it's plugged 
into the serial ports of two com- 
puters, they both think they're 
plugged into a modem with a 
pre-existing connection and can 
exchange information, often at 
higher speeds than real modems 
can manage. 

Protocol - A protocol is the set 
of rules by which computing de- 
vices exchange information. In 
comms parlance, protocols re- 
late to the low-level systems 
used by modems to encode in- 
formation, and to the higher- 
level systems (transfer proto- 
cols) used when uploading and 
downloading files. 

Synchronous - The newer 
system for sending data. In syn- 
chronous transmission, each 
data character (byte) follows

on. This is faster and less error- 
prone than asynchronous trans- 
mission (q.v.), but it requires the 
sender and receiver to use ex- 
actly the same timing, and is 
hence harder (read more expen- 
sive) to implement. 

Upload - To send a file from 
your computer to another com- 
puter with a modem, or over a 
null modem cable. 

V.fast - The preliminary name 
for the 28,800 Bps modem stan- 
dard, used while the standard 
was in development and adopted 
by a number of manufacturers as 
a sort of unofficial pseudo- 
standard before the CCITT rati- 
fied v.34. V.fast (also known as 
V,FC) is not compatible with 
V.34, though some modems sup- 
port both standards, 

XModem - An old transfer pro- 
tocol, which doesn't allow auto- 
starting, auto-resume or file- 
name sending like ZModem 
(q.v.). It survives only in antique 
machines, braindead comms 
programs (like Windows Termi- 
nal) and cheap baby computers. 

ZModem - The de facto stan- 
dard protocol for transferring 
files between computers with 
modems. ZModem supports a 
load of features to make your 
online life easier - obvious stuff, 
like sending the filename so you 
don't have to type it in, but also 
things like batch sends (you 
don't need to start a new send 
for every individual file) and 
auto-resume (if you only got 
part of a file for some reason, 
the transfer will start again 
where it left off instead of delet- 
ing the old file fragment and 
starting again). All bulletin 
boards worth bothering with 
support ZModem, as do Internet 
service providers who give you 
shell accounts.

I The Albury/Wodonga Com- 
modore User Group is looking for 
new members. Half their member- 
ship is C64/128, but they'd like to 
boost their numbers. AWCUG is 
now catering for "distance" mem- 
bers, and so far has members from 
throughout NSW, Victoria and SA. 
The club publishes a monthly 
newsletter, "Borderline", and 
meets the first Tuesday of each 
month. They maintain a very ex- 
tensive public domain software li- 
brary. If you'd like some informa- 
tion for AWCUG, or would like to 
join, please contact the President, 
Robert Lord, on (060) 59 1469. 

Function keys 

Using the C64's function keys 
in your own programs is easy. The 
C64 treats its function keys like 
any other keys; all your program 
has to do is "listen" out for them. 

The secret is the ASCII/CHR$ 
codes. All characters you can use 
on the C64 are assigned a value in 
the 64' s version of the ASCII set. 
For example, the letter A is also 
known as 65, B as 66 and so forth. 

You usually check GET$ and 
INPUTS by comparing with char- 
acters: IF A$="A" THEN GOTO, 
but you can also use IF 
A$=CHR$(65) THEN GOTO - it's 
just more convenient to use "A". 

Although it is possible to use 
an unusual looking character to 
represent a function key in a simi- 
lar fashion, for this example we're 
going to use the C64's ASCII 
code. ASCII codes for Fl, F3, F5 



and F7 run from 133 to 136 inclu- 
sive, while F2, F4, F6 and F8 (the 
shifted- function keys) run from 
137 to 140. So how do we use 
this? 

The best way is through a small 
subroutine. This routine will wait 
for the user to press one of the 
function keys, and then print the 
name of the key pressed. Not very 
useful, but it serves as a good ex- 
ample.

Line 10 continually loops until 
the user presses a key. 

Line 20 converts the value into 
a raw ASCII value, which is ex- 
actly what we need to work with. 

Line 30 checks to see if it was 
in fact a function key that was 
pressed. If the ASCII value is be- 
low 133 or above 140, it obviously 
wasn't a function key, and the pro- 
gram loops back to the start. 

Line 40 is a novel way to break 
off into various branches of a pro- 
gram. The ON-GOSUB combina- 
tion means "if the number is a one, 
go to 100, if it's a two go to 320" 
etc. By subtracting 132 from the 
value, the program takes the value 
back to a range of 1-8. It says that 
if, after subtracting 132, the num- 
ber is 1 then do the subroutine at 
line 100. After the GOSUB is just 



a list of line numbers to jump to. 

We could easily have said IF A 
= 133 THEN GOSUB 100, IF A = 
134 THEN GOSUB 120, but this 
would be much longer. 

Lines 100-250 just print the 
pressed function key's name. The 
RETURN after each line tells the 
program to jump back to where it 
left off before it was told to jump 
to a sub- routine. In this case, that's 
line 50, where it's simply told to 
go back to the start. This creates an 
endless loop. 

There are many applications 
for the function keys. A likely use 
would be a menu at the start of a 
program, or a small program to 
load other programs from disk. 

I mentioned earlier that you 
could use an unusual character in- 
stead of checking the result against 
the ASCII character set. This may 
be easier if you only want to check 
for one or two function keys in- 
stead of all eight. 

To generate these unusual 
looking characters, which are actu- 
ally Commodore graphic charac- 
ters, simply type an open quote (") 
and then press the function key 
you need to listen for. Here's an 
example application for this: 



A$ 



IF A$ = 



1 GET 
••■THEN 10 

2 IF A$= " <press 

••here)" then print "Fl was 
••pressed" 

20 IF A$= "(press 
■*here>" then print "F2 was 
••pressed" 



fl 



f2 



and so on. Obviously this is more 
cumbersome if you're listening for 
all of the function keys, but for 
quick spot checks, it does the job. 

That's all for this edition of 
The C64 Column. Until next mon- 
th, if you'd like to get in touch I'd 
love to hear from you. Write to me

Do it yourself 
home control 



By David Boddy 



► Have you ever had the stereo 
playing so loud that you couldn't 
hear the phone or the doorbell 
ring? Have you ever tried to find 
the right (one by three millimeter) 
remote control button in the dark 
while watching a movie? 

The Amiga has totally elimi- 
nated these and many other day to 
day problems from my life. 



The problem 

Several years ago, my stereo 
remote controls began dominating 
the coffee table. 

You always seem to have the 
wrong remote in your hand, so I 
rushed out and bought one of those 
programmable remotes and taught 
it the codes from the other re- 
motes. Problem solved. Well, al- 




Fig t.The two top rows control video and audio. The third row 
is the TV control, since that's what's currently selected. 



most. There may be only one re- 
mote, but with over 100 buttons 
each the size of a Coco Pop, you 
also need 20/20 night vision, and a 
finger that tapers down like a ball 
point pen. 

The solution 

MediaPhile (MP) has been 
around for a several years now. For 
the benefit of those unaware of its 
function, here's a brief rundown. 

MP lets you digitise infrared 
(IR) codes from remote controls 
and send them back out, on com- 
mand. You can also read timecode 
from domestic video cassette 
recorders (VCR's), MP has a li- 
brary of software for editing and 
VCR control, but like all great 
Amiga programs, there's an 
ARexx backdoor. 

After storing all of my remote 
controls' IR codes on the hard disk 
- some 300 codes, from Play Tape 
on the VCR to Volume Up on the 
preamp, 1 quickly lost enthusiasm 
for sending ARexx commands 
from the CLI to control everything. 
Hey, this is an Amiga! I want pull 
down menus and gadgets and nice 
IFF backgrounds! 

It was about this time that I dis-

AMIGA Review 




covered the ultimate pro- 
grammable Arexx command gen- 
erator, CanDo. That's right - the in- 
tuitive programming language 
CanDo has great support for 
ARexx message passing. 

Creating gadgets, pulldown 
menus and hotkeys in CanDo is so 
easy and fast that I actually 
stopped using Lattice C altogether. 
There are always new ideas to im- 
plement and bugs to fix, but the 
software I call Computrol is now at 
a very usable level. 

How to do it 

The first stage was computer 
control of the stereo and VCRs, to 
eliminate the remote controls. 

At the Boddy residence, all the 
computer equipment and stereo 
components live in the study and 
the lounge room contains only 
speakers, a monitor and an IR 
pickup that beams all IR com- 
mands to the study. The lounge 
room TV displays not only the 
video and TV signals from the 
study, but genlocked Amiga graph- 
ics overlaid as well. 

Add an IR cordless trackball in 
the lounge room, and I've got full 
computer control of the VCRs and 
stereo from the lounge room. Just 
point at the large, easy to see icons 
overlaid on the TV's picture and 
click (see figure 1). 

I spent a long time designing 
the control interface and icons so 
they were easy to use and see. 
Even in the dark you can read the 
icons, because they're on the TV 

Cando allows multiple IR com- 
mands to be sent with just one 
mousey trackball click, so if you're 
watching the TV and you'd like to 
keep watching the same show but 
listen to the audio from the radio 
tuner, one click can turn the radio 
tuner on and tell the switcher to 
patch the new audio source though 
to the speakers in the lounge room. 

If you're controlling the system 
from the study, no graphics are dis-

played in the lounge, and the study 
control screen is full of gadgets 
and icons and 80 column type - a 
lot more information can be shown 
on the computer screen (see fig- 
ures 3 and 4). 

The computer could make its 
own decision and send codes as 
well, so I made new modules that 
would let you record TV shows au- 
tomatically and also show TV pro- 
grams automatically. 

You simply go through the TV 
guide entering shows of interest to 
view or record, and log them in a 
list (see figure 5). A lot easier than 
programming the VCR. You can 
also log radio shows, When the 
time comes for the event you 
logged, the computer prompts you 
to Watch, Record or Ignore. 

If you say Watch, and you were 
previously listening to a CD, it not 
only switches to the show you re- 
quested but pauses the CD player 
as well. When the show finishes, 
the CD's put back on for you. 

Ignore simply lets the event go 
by; Record's the same as Ignore, 
but it tapes the event for later. If 
the Record flag is set in the log 
screen, this becomes the default. 

Computrol saves to disk a log 
file of any show it records on its 
tape, and the timecode where it 
starts and finishes, so that later on 
you can select shows from the 
tape, and have them found, cued 
up and played without any messy 
manual searching. It even uses the 
Picture In Picture (PIP) function in 
the VCR to display the cueing pic- 
tures, so that until it's cued you can 
watch other TV. 

From the lounge, all of the 
computer prompts appear as large 
video typeface, but an Amiga 
sound sample also comes through 
the speakers. I sampled lots of Mel 
Blanc, so if I hear Daffy Duck 
talking I know that the computer 
has a message for me on the TV. 

As Computrol grew, it became 
necessary to install gadgets to let 



34 



AMIGA Review 







the computer know where I was - 
in the lounge room, study, gone to 
bed, gone out and so on. 

If you leave the house, Compu- 
trol turns all the stereo hardware 
off, but keeps track of shows to 
record and will turn the VCR on, 
select the TV channel and record 
the show. After the show has fin- 
ished Computrol again turns the 
equipment it was using off. 

Most of the dubbing I do is best 
done while I'm sleeping, so that 
the equipment's available while 
I'm up and about. Timecode is 
read during dubbing, so the com- 
puter knows which way the tape is 
travelling and how fast. If it detec- 
ts rewinding then the dub has fin- 
ished, so it waits for the tape to 
finish rewinding and powers off 
the equipment. 

Big Brother's watching... 

My uncle's a mad D.I.Y. elec- 
tronics fellow and had finished a 
whole series of real world inter- 
faces for monitoring temperature 
and moisture and reading passive 
infra-red detectors (PIRs) and ul- 
trasonic motion detectors into the 
control port on a Commodore 64. 

By using some of his designs 
and a few of my own I came up 
with a circuit board that plugs into 
the parallel port and reads up to 8 
PIRs. The design was constructed 
in trusty Deluxe Paint (see Figure 
6), with the dot matrix printout 
used as a template to drill the holes 
in the circuit board before the 
tracks were etched. 

I went searching for PIR sen- 
sors and found that most home se- 
curity places had them from be- 
tween $90 and $180 each. Then I 
discovered that a lighting shop had 
a PIR light switch. I bought one, 
took it home and opened it up. It 
was the same setup, runs on 12 
volts and trips a 5 volt line to 
earth. There was extra electronics 
for switching 240V lights, so I re- 
moved the unneeded bits and end- 



ed up with a PIR sensor for $30. 

A week later that same lighting 
store had a sale, so I bought up 
seven more. They may not be as 
good as the SI 00 models, they may 
false trip more often, but clever 
software can eliminate false trips. 

Some more CanDo/C program- 
ming, and with an IFF representa- 
tion of the house on screen (see 
figure 7) the software would log all 
movement within the house - the 
basis of a home alarm monitoring 
system. It even monitors the front 
doorbell. 

If someone rings the doorbell, 
Computrol pauses the tape you're 
watching or the CD you're listen- 
ing to, plays a sound sample 
through the stereo (random selec- 
tion of door bell sounds) and re- 
turns you to whatever you were lis- 
tening to. 

Just before you leave the 
house, you tell the computer 
you're leaving and just click an on- 
screen button to arm the alarm. It 
reads the PIRs until it detects no 



more movement and then arms it- 
self (smart alarm). 

...and the phone 

The last hardware interface I 
added was The Answer. It uses a 
CanDo deck with some hardware 
to act as an answering machine, 
and allows you to send line out au- 
dio from the stereo down the 
phone line and bring the audio 
from the phone line into your 
stereo or sound sampler. It's fan- 
tastic editing your answering ma- 
chine message with digital cut and 
paste on the Amiga. 

And any message left can also 
be edited - I started making a di- 
rectory of hellos so that at some 
stage if you ring in, your own 
voice may answer hello. Freaky. 

Unfortunately, The Answer 
needs a sound sampler connected 
into the parallel port, where my 
PIR interface was already connect- 
ed. 

With some more C program- 
ming I am now able to control the

system and records shows. Note the genlocked graphics

entire answering machine and 
all the PIR's from just joyport 2 
(that's only 9 pins). 

With The Answer you can also 
play samples of the tone dial 
sounds to ring the phone number 
selected. The alarm system could 
thus ring me at work (or on a mo- 
bile phone) if there's a breakin and 
the Amiga can give me real time 
feedback about what rooms the in- 
truders are now in and where they 
first entered. This has been a very 
simple look at a very complicated 
piece of software - there are far too 
many routines to describe here. 
But I hope it has given you some 
insight into the system, and maybe 
encourage you to experiment in 
some D.I.Y. yourself. 

Where will it all end? Between 
my graphics and animation com- 
mitments there's not much other 
spare time, but this side project has 
been a lot of fun over the last few 
years. I think that the development 
time compared to the time it will 
save me is about 1:1, so it's not re-

PROGRAMMING 



Life in the AGAR ecosphere 

► Welcome to this month's Blitz 
Basic column. This month we'll be 
leaving the Beginners series of 
columns and throwing out a chal- 
lenge to the intermediate program- 
mers out there. This project will 
provide plenty of interest and 
scope for enhancement for the ad- 
vanced programmer, while at the 
same time being basic enough for 
beginners to get a handle on and 
have something mealy to examine. 
This month's project is an en- 
tertaining look at a simulation ap- 
plication, where we'll be attempt- 
ing to recreate a fully enclosed en- 
vironment and stock it with our 
very own organisms. Yes folks, 
now is your big chance to oversee 
your very own little universe full 
of your very own critters. Your 
world will be a plane! covered with 
water, inhabited by two sorts of or- 
ganisms - fish and sharks. In any 
good universe there are laws of 
physics, and this one's no excep- 
tion. 

The laws of physics 

The planet is divided up into a 
square grid, 78 by 26 squares big. 
Only one organism can occupy 
each square at any one time. Fish 
don't move, they simply feed with- 
in their square on plankton. There 
is a random chance per generation 
that a fish will produce offspring, 
the baby fish moving into any va- 
cant square adjacent to its parent. 

Sharks, however, must eat the 
fish to survive (oh the horror.,.), 



and must move into the square oc- 
cupied by the fish in order to con- 
sume it. If a shark is not adjacent 
to a fish, there is a random chance 
that it will starve to death. If it sur- 
vives, it moves into a random adja- 
cent square in its search for fish. If 
a shark feeds, there is a random 
chance that it will produce off- 
spring, again into an adjacent and 
vacant square. 

And so it goes, the endless 
passing of time, the ceaseless 
stream of generations of fish and 
sharks, a simulation of predator 
and quarry that is mirrored in our 
own universe. Having thus defined 
the rules, it's time to start design- 
ing! 

Design time 

The most important considera- 
tion for this application is the way 
we store the location of our organ- 
isms within our world. A two di- 
mensional array of bytes is the 
most logical way. 

If you're not familiar with the 
concept of a two dimensional ar- 
ray, think about a chess board. 
Each of its 64 squares or areas can 
be uniquely referred to by an x co- 
ordinate and a y co-ordinate. So, 
for example, the white king starts 
on square 5,8. It's important to un- 
derstand that 5.8 is just the address 
or location of the square, and that 
it contains data; in the example we 
could allocate a code number for 
each piece, and a white king might 
be represented by the number 1 . 

In Blitz terms, the map is 
stored in a two dimensional array 
of bytes called map.b(x,y), where x 
is the first dimension and y is the 
second. Our map is much bigger 
than a chess board, at 78 by 26 
squares. The data we're going to 
store in the array is either a 1 for a 
fish, or a 2 for a shark. So if you 
want to put a fish on the map 6 
squares out and 8 squares down, 
you'd use the command: 
Map(6,8)=l. This stores the num- 



ber 1 within the array. You could 
then check what type of organism 
is living in square 6,8 with the 
command: org=map(6,8), which 
sets the variable to either a for an 
empty square, or a 1 or 2 depend- 
ing on what critter has taken up 
residence! We're going to display 
our world by using a simple win- 
dow and text characters, but there's 
nothing stopping you from improv- 
ing this display with graphics and 
animated sprites. We'll use a Hires 
screen and a plain window, and 
represent fish with the character 
">" and sharks with "$", printed in 
different colours to make the 
sharks stand out. 

Constants 

Before you start coding I want 
to talk about constants. We're go- 
ing to use constants instead of 
variables in a few cases, to make it 
easier to make little adjustments to 
the program. The constants include 
the starting numbers of each type 
of organism, as well as the rate at 
which they breed and starve. If you 
make a change to a constant at the 
start of the program, Blitz will au- 
tomatically change every occur- 
rence of the number throughout the 
rest of the code. This makes it 
much easier to fiddle about with 
the settings, and observe the effec- 
ts on the simulation. A constant is 
denoted by the § symbol, for ex- 
ample #pi=3.I416. 

The whole program consists of 
five functions or statements; I'll go 
through these in detail later on. Ai 
the start of the program, I use the 
deftype.l command to instruct 
Blitz to make all my variables long 
words unless otherwise specified. 
Then I open a hires screen and a 
simple window with a close gad- 
get. Then comes the constant dec- 
larations and dimensioning of the 
main map array. The last com- 
mand, at the end of the code, calls 
the statement Main {}, which starts 
the program proper.

END IF 
PROGRAMMING 



DRAWSQUARE {x,y} 

This function updates the 
screen display to reflect what's 
stored in the map array. To place a 
fish in the world, you have to do 
two things - store the fish in the 
map array and call 

DRAWSQUARE {} to actually 
print the fish to the screen for the 
benefit of the observer. The two 
parameters passed are the x and the 
y co-ordinates of the square to be 
updated. From here you just set the 
location of the cursor and print the 
correct character for the organism 
in the correct colour, 

INIT 

The INIT {} statement is called 
at the start of execution to set up 
the map with some starting organ- 
isms. It simply places the amount 
of fish and sharks defined by your 
constants #fisbmax and #sharkmax 
in the map array and on the screen 
(with a call to DRAWSQUARE 
{}). It selects a random starting 
square for each organism. 

CHECKF1SH {x,y} 

This function checks all the ad- 
jacent squares to the passed x,y lo- 
cation for the presence of fish. It 
stores the co-ordinates of any adja- 
cent square containing a fish in a 
special format, to make it easier to 
handle. The format is simply the x 
value multiplied by 100 and added 
to the y value. By doing it this 
way, you can store two numbers in 
one. To extract the two numbers 
again it's x=number/100 and 
y= number mod 100. The function 
returns the number of squares that 
contain fish, so a shark can check 
to see if it starves if the number is 
zero, or can eat a random fish if 
it's greater than zero. 

GENERATION {} 

This function is the main work- 
ing part of the program, as you 
might have guessed by the size of 



it! Each time this function is 
called, it checks every square in 
the map array for organisms. If it 
finds a fish, it checks to see if that 
fish has offspring - the chance of 
this is defined in the constant 
#fishbirth (one in ten). If so, it at- 
tempts to place the new fish in an 
adjacent, vacant square. The new 
fish is displayed on the screen with 
a call to the statement 
DRAWSQUARE {}. 

If the organism within a square 
is a shark instead of a fish, we call 
the function CHECKFISH {} to 
look for food in the adjacent 
squares. If it doesn't find any, we 
check to see if the shark starves, 
the chance of this being defined by 
the constant #sharkstarve. If the 
shark survives its fast, it moves to 
a random adjacent vacant square. 
Again, DRAWSQUARE {} is 
called to update the screen to re- 
flect changes to the map() array. 

If, however, the shark finds a 
fish in an adjacent square, it moves 
there and eats it! If there's more 
than one fish adjacent to the shark, 
it selects one at random. Moving 
the shark to eat the fish is simply a 
matter of clearing the shark's origi- 
nal square, and changing the data 
in the fish's square from a fish to a 
shark. Again, we call 
DRAWSQUARE {} to update the 
screen display. If a shark feeds, it 
makes a check against the constant 
#sharkbirth to see if it has a baby 
shark; this offspring also requires 
an adjacent vacant square to be 
born into. 

Because sharks move around 
the map, we need a method to flag 
that they've acted this generation, 
so we don't activate them again as 
we move down the map searching 
for organisms - remember that 
GENERATION {} searches 
through each square on the map in 
a set pattern. So when a shark has 
acted for the generation, we store a 
#moved number in the map for it. 
After all the squares have been 



processed for the generation, we 
go through and reset them back to 
their normal values. As we en- 
counter each shark, we increase the 
variable sharkcount by one; this 
gives us an interesting statistic to 
observe as the generations stream 
by. 

MAIN {} 

The last statement is the main 
control loop for the entire program. 
It calls INIT { } when the program 
is first started, and calls GENERA- 
TION {} after a delay, enabling the 
viewer to see what is happening at 
a human frame rate, MAIN {} also 
checks for a quit command, either 
via a close window event or a 
press of the escape key event. I've 
put in some code to check for the 
press of a gadget, so you can ex- 
pand this program by putting in 
any additional features you can 
think of - a restart button, for in- 
stance. Main also updates some 
simple statistical information of 
the number of generations that 
have elapsed, and the current num- 
ber of sharks alive and kicking. 

That's it for this month; I hope 
you've enjoyed this article. I know 
it's been a bit long winded, but this 
program has a lot of potential for 
modification. The possibilities are 
almost endless. You could add dif- 
ferent organisms, change the laws 
of physics for the world, make it 
bigger, give the fish the ability to 
move, add lots of nice features like 
load, save and restart and so on. 
Go to work! 

If you have any ideas or com- 
ments about Blitz Basic, or put to- 
gether an award winning program 
out of this month's tutorial, then 
please send a letter or disk to me, 
ROY HURLEY, Box 1420, Wol- 
longong 2500. Until next month, 
keep coding, and Blitz on dudes!

By Ron Kelly 






I I've spent a couple of years try- 
ing to come up with the best pro- 
gram for keeping sporting club 
records, such as ladders and player 
rankings for my local table tennis 
club. Another Amiga -owning 
friend who kept squash club 
records on an ancient program 
called Unicalc showed me his sys- 
tem, but I was sure there had to be 
something better. Unicalc didn't 
even have file requesters, for pity's 
sake! It did have a very good sort- 
ing command called "Arrange", 
and little else unless you had 
grown used to its keyboard com- 
mands. 

So I took the piunge and 
bought Procalc2.0. It was a great 
improvement on Unicalc, but its 
database sorting facilties were not 
reliable and had to regularly be 
fixed by hand. Another problem 
was that I couldn't get fancy 
colour output to my whizz-bang 
new Canon BJC600, having to set- 
tle for text. Procalc's colour screen 
dump can only be used for charts, 
not general use. Even then, the 
bitmapped output wasn't much to 
write home about. 

Then one day I noticed Emer- 
ald Creative's spiffy looking ad for 
TurboCalc V2.0 from Germany 



(now home of the Amiga!) so I 
thought I may as well give it a 
burl. Hallelujah! 

Straight away, I knew this was 
the best Amiga spreadsheet yet, 
and despite one or two quirks dis- 
covered since, I've become a true 
believer. Besides its modern look 
and feel, tool-bar, great configura- 
bility, wide range of features and 
good manual, it's TurboCalc's 
Graphic Print output option which 
really sets it apart. 

The selected print range is 
printed to the maximum resolution 
of the printer, a la PageStream. So, 
provided outline fonts are used, 
you can get very high print quality. 
It's not exactly WYSIWYG, as 
you can tell by comparing the 
screenshot with the printed ladder 
example, but it's close enough 
when you knows that the printed 
results will be better than the 
screen. 

TurboCalc's manual should 
ideally be read in a German ac- 
cent! It manages to get the mes- 
sage across OK, but it seems rather 
verbose at times. Nevertheless, the 
manual allows you to delve in to 
whatever depth is comfortable. 
Macro and ARexx programming 



chapters will appeal to power 
users, who can include TurboCalc 
in their mega-applications with 
ease. 

There must be plenty of Amiga 
people out there who, like me, 
have to keep sporting club records, 
so perhaps a word or two on my 
spreadsheet design may help. Of 
course, I don't profess this to be 
the best set-up - perhaps you have 
what you believe to be a better 
way, using a database program for 
example, in which case let's hear 
about it! 

At the top left of the sheet is 
the team ladder database. Under- 
neath are databases for individual 
and doubles rankings (used to seed 
players in tournaments and future 
team competitions etc.) The fig- 
ures in these areas come from else- 
where on the sheet automatically. 
To the right, each team has a hori- 
zontally oriented section with sub- 
sections for each player, doubles 
combination and areas for substi- 
tutes to be entered. Each week a 
new row of data is entered here to 
build up the season's records. Each 
sub-section reports back to a team 
totals summary, the totals of which 
are the cells referenced by the lad- 
der database areas.

At the same time, each player's 
sub-section totals are referenced by 
the rankings database. With Turbo- 
Calc, absolute cell references must 
be used in databases, (e.g. =$Q$21 
not just =Q21) a lesson I learnt the 
hard way and which doesn't follow 
the approach used by ProCalc, 
which logically assumes database 
operations require cell references 
to remain absolute. A small imper- 
fection, perhaps to be addressed in 
future versions. 

The ladder and the rankings are 
sorted in reverse order of priority, - 
points percentage first, then games 
%, sets % and premiership points. 
If a bye is in operation, a match ra- 
tio is used as the last and therefore 
top sorting priority. Naturally, dif- 
ferent sports have different scoring 
methods and priorities, but you'll 
know what's applicable to your sit- 
uation. 

Colour is used not only for ef- 
fect but also to easily follow team 
progress. Each team has a colour- 
coded background and members 
can at a glance see where the team 



is and where they are on the rank- 
ings. It's also a good way of keep- 
ing track of who's in what team. 
Patterned backgrounds can also be 
used if you run out of colours. 

As yet, I have not come up 
with a way of using a scoresheet 
template to more easily enter each 
week's data into the spreadsheet, 
rather than having to manually add 
up each player's totals. I know it 
can be done, because my predeces- 
sor had it worked out using Lotus 
1-2-3. Alas, he has passed away, 
taking his knowledge with him. If 
you can help in this regard, write 
in and share your ideas. 

I can thoroughly recommend 
TurboCalc, not only for its very ca- 
pable spreadsheet functions, speed 
and flexibility but also for its pro- 
fessional output quality and inte- 
gration of Amiga conventions 
which make it easy to drive yet 
vast in its breadth of capability, 
like a good German car.

AMIGA Review 




► Finally, the moment the Amiga 
world has been waiting for for so 
long has arrived. The Amiga tech- 
nology's new owner has been de- 
cided. 

Escom AG, the second biggest 
PC maker in Germany ($US2 bil- 
lion in sales in 1994), only became 
visible in the Amiga ownership 
race late in the piece, although 
they now say they've been after 
the Amiga since August 1994. In 
any case, they've turned out to be 
the upset winner. They're getting 
the AGA machines back into pro- 
duction and haven't ruled out any- 
thing regarding their plans for the 
machine's future. 

We were all expecting a bid- 



By Daniel Rutter 



ding war between the most vocal 
Amiga aspirants - CEI and Com- 
modore UK. Escom had been quiet 
about its plans for the Amiga; ev- 
eryone knew the German company 
had tons of money but its actual 
level of interest in owning the 
Amiga technology was anyone's 
guess. 

On the day, it turned out that 
Commodore UK and CEI didn't 
enter any bids at all! The three bids 
entered at the auction were from 
Escom, Dell Computer (who 
hadn't even been rumoured to be 
involved before) and Creative 
Computers, a large Californian 
dealer. 

The bid from Creative Comput- 



ers was rejected, because they 
didn't come up with the required 
SUS1 million security deposit. 

The Dell bid (for an undis- 
closed amount) was apparently in 
association with CEI - if the bid 
was successful, CEI would become 
Dell's Amiga division. However, 
the bid carried the condition that 
Dell wanted to examine some 
patents before finalising the sale, 
and wanted 30 days to make sure 
they actually wanted the Amiga, 
forfeiting their $US1 million de- 
posit if they decided to drop the 
deal and starting the whole process 
again. This bid was also thrown 
out. 

Immediately after the auction, 



AMIGA Review

Commodore UK issued a press 
release which said that they'd re- 
alised in [he days leading up to the 
auction that Escom or Dell would 
have "the financial muscle to over- 
bid our independently financed of- 
fer", and that they thus "took the 
decision to withdraw early and 
work with the winning bidder." 

On April 21st, the day after the 
auction, the three pre-filed objec- 
tions from the US creditors, IBM 
and the Commodore Nether- 
lands/Philippines/UK trustees were 
heard and, reportedly, overruled 
without great drama, although the 
Netherlands trustees managed to 
temporarily remove the parts held 
in Commodore's Philippines ware- 
house, and the Commodore UK 
company, from the buyout pack- 
age. Escom is expected to buy the 
Philippines stock separately, and 
may buy out or work with Com- 
modore UK. 

There was another, new, objec- 
tion from Dell, who entered a new 
SUS15 million bid. still with the 
30 day cooling off period. Escom 
put another $US6.5 million on 
their own bid, bringing it to 
SUS12.1 million. Dell were shown 
the door. They were offering more 
dollars, but they could also change 
their minds and leave, and the 
creditors weren't going to stand for 
that. So Escom won. 

Early interviews 

In an early interview with Josh 
Galun and Giorgio Gomelsky. of 
Amiga Link Online magazine and 
the AMUSE Amiga user group, 
Escom sounded very open minded 
about the machine. 

Eseom's representative was 
Bernard van Tienen. ex vice- 
president of Commodore Interna- 
tional (he estimated that about 100 
ex-Commodore staff were already 
at Escom). While he didn't make 
any definite statements about Es- 
com 's plans he didn't rule out 
Amigas being used in set-top box- 



es, being powered by PowerPC 
processors, or being cloned in 
technology licensing deals. 




Tienen said Escom was setting 
up a group of advisors to help 
them plan their Amiga strategy, 
and indicated that this group would 
include as much of the Amiga 
community as possible. He men- 
tioned that Escom plan to be acces- 
sible to Amiga users - which will 
be a refreshing change, against the 
frustrating isolation of the old 
management. 

Tienen also said that Escom 
plans to be shipping new Amigas 
inside three months, and will have 
them in their own large chain of 
stores and, of course, others as 
well. 

Josh and Giurgio went on to in- 
terview Colin Proudfoot of Com- 
modore UK, who said he was 
looking forward to working with 
Escom. He said that it was an aca- 
demic question whether Com- 
modore UK would continue to ex- 
ist as a separate company or be 
bought by Escom; in any case, he 
anticipated that most of the current 
staff would be retained. He empha- 
sised (hat. in his view at least, 
global marketing was the way to 
go, which is good news for those 
of us who don't live in Europe or 
the US. Proudfoot 's view of Es- 
eom's reason for getting the Amiga 
was simple - according to him, Es- 
com are looking to expand out of 
Europe, and in order to do so need 
something more marketable than 
yet another brand of PC clone. 



The Amiga, according to 
Proudfoot, fits the bill. 

Proudfoot also mentioned the 
importance of good relations with 
developers, and thanked the devel- 
oper community for its support. 

Dan Stets of the Philadelphia 
Enquirer, who's been following the 
whole sordid story from the start, 
also spoke to Escom and largely 
confirmed what Tienen said in the 
interview. According to Stets. Es- 
com plans to manufacture Amigas 
in a plant near Beijing, China 
(there will be no American manu- 
facturing operation), in a joint ven- 
ture with Tietsin, a Chinese elec- 
tronics firm with a background in 
game console manufacturing and 
what's billed as one of the largest 
distribution organisations in China, 

Eseom's policy 

In a later press release in Ger- 
man. Escom officially announced 
their takeover of everything cov- 
ered by the Commodore and 
Amiga names, and also said that 
they intend to continue the Com- 
modore and Amiga product lines, 
with machines distributed world 
wide. They also said they plan to 
manufacture the C64 again, aiming 
it at the eastern European market. 

Escom said they're working on 
integrating Amiga and IBM- 
compatible technology - in the 
form of PC cards with Amiga 
chips on them. In this, Escom seem 
to be following the 3 DO corpora- 
tion (formed by disgruntled ex- 
Commodorians) and their 3 DO 
cards as well as standalone ma- 
chines, Escom sounded keen about 
Amiga set-top boxes for interactive 
TV. 

They also displayed enthusiasm 
for the growing Chinese market, 
along with more information on 
the Chinese manufacturing compa- 
ny, which apparently has a 80 per 
cent share of the Chinese game 
machine market sewn up.

AMIGA Review 



Engineering boss speaks 

Now, a message of intent from Dr. Peter Kittel, 
new leader of the Amiga engineering division. 



Most important item first: I 
have my job, and it's world-wide 
boss of engineering. Yes, I know, I 
start into a very difficult task, as 
successor to some real celebrities. 
On the other hand, I had II years 
at Commodore to study what is the 
wrong strategy and which leads to 
success. I will try to avoid these 
known errors. 

And now for the big picture: 
There will be a new, completely 
selfstanding daughter company of 
Escom AG, with its own own ad- 
dress in Heppenheim [the location 
of Escom's HOJ. It will be the 
headquarters of the new company, 
with control and coordination for 
the whole world. There will be one 
subsidiary in the Netherlands, and 
it will do Europe-wide distribution 
and sales. Further country sub- 
sidiaries are not impossible, but 
there aren't any concrete decisions 
about UK, USA, and Canada in 
particular. 

The new company has yet to be 
founded, but this is currently in the 
works. The name is not yet decid- 
ed, it will probably be something 
like "Commodore- Amiga" or 
"Amiga-Commodore". This com- 
pany will (at least for the time be- 
ing) deal exclusively in Amiga 
computers. 

As can be inferred from the 
first paragraph, there will be an en- 
gineering department, for hardware 
and operating system software. 
We've already got promising con- 
tacts with well-known and well- 
respected names. Yet there's no 
problem if someone wants to send 
his resume (no email or fax, 
please) to: 
Escom AG 
Personalabteilu ng 



Tiergartenstr, 9 

D'64646 Heppenheim Germany 

You see, we consider ourselves 
an international company. Of 
course we only want the best ones 

There will be a Support depart- 
ment which will do world-wide co- 
ordination, but also covers the Ger- 
man area. Thus most of these peo- 
ple should be German-speaking. 
The Amiga Developer Support 
Program (ADSP) will be reactivat- 
ed as soon as possible. We haven't 
yet decided about those developers 
currently using BIX or CIX. These 
people should feel free to contact 
me directly at my private email ac- 
count (there's no company one yet) 
and giving some input. In the past 
years there was a split among the 
developer community into differ- 
ent communication channels so no 
direct communication among the 
developers was possible, and for 
engineering this meant double 
work to explain the same issues 
once on one net and then again on 
another net. We will do everything 
to avoid this nonsense in future. 

There are big obstacles, as 
there are big cost differences in 
different regions of the earth, and 
simultaneously a high degree of 
confidentiality has to be main- 
tained. Enduser support will hap- 
pen mostly in electronic form, via 
mailbox, Internet, and probably al- 
so Bix, 

Of course there will also be a 
Marketing department and what is 
needed in administration. All to- 
gether, this will be a rather slim 
company of about 50 people at 
first, but further expansion is of 
course not impossible. 

It's planned to restart produc- 



tion of the current models, proba- 
bly in full scale, but there's no 
guarantee yet for this. Also of 
course not all models will appear 
at the same time, but one after the 
other. As Escom has its own large 
casing production facility, the 
Amigas may get a redesign of their 
styling, in any case for the A4000, 
but the hardware under the hood 
will remain unchanged at first. 

For production to restart, first 
diverse contributing factories have 
to revive their production of parts. 
New developments would mean 
additional months of waiting, be- 
fore you could buy the products. 
That would be too big a sacrifice. 

The direction of the new engi- 
neering department will definitely 
be the port to some RISC platform. 
The choice of this RISC is still 
open. There are ecstatic advocates 
for at least two alternatives, Pow- 
erPC and HP PA RISC. Chris Lud- 
wig gave an interesting interview 
about this [in which he said that 
CBM before its death had decided 
on the HP product]. It will be the 
first task of engineering to prepare 
this choice of paths into the future. 

It has been decided to be very 
liberal in regard to licensing in the 
future. So whoever wants to build, 
for example, an Amiga laptop or a 
set- top box can get chips and OS! 

As you all see, much of this is 
still a letter of intent. The points 
which are declared as still open are 
REALLY open, so there's no use 
in bombarding me with further 
questions. 

As my workload, at least now 
in the building phase, will be im- 
mense, I can't guarantee my pres- 
ence on the net like before. But 
who knows me, knows that that 
would be most painful for me my- 
self. So let's look forward. 

In the next weeks there will be 
press conferences to tell more and 
more details. 

Long live the Amiga.

AMIGA Review 







I You used to know where 
you were with a movie con- 
version game. They were 
stock standard platform 
numbers with characters 
featuring some small resem- 
blance to the cast and loca- 
tions featuring some smaller 
resemblance to the sets and 
gameplay featuring practi- 
cally no resemblance to the 
plot. At best they were OK, 
at worst (the norm) they 
were lousy. 

But Disney have 
changed that. 

Sure, Aladdin's a plat- 



form game converted from a 
movie. But it's beautiful, playable 
and funny. The console version of 
this game's sold like wildfire, and 
with good reason; I'm pleased to 
report that the AGA Amiga ver- 
sion's not suffered much from be- 
ing crammed onto three disks. 

The bad points first. You can't

sponsive - Aladdin skids around a 
bit but you get used to that. You 
can use your sword or lob apples at 
the bad guys, and you can switch 
between modes by slapping the 
space bar, or by pulling down and 
holding the button; the space bar is 
definitely the best way. You can, of 
course, leap about, climb ropes and 
ladders, hand-over-hand your way 
along clotheslines, slide down 
poles and do all the rest of the 
standard platform game sen tick, 
and you can get off a rope, pole or 
whatever whenever you want, and 
swing your sword or chuck an ap- 
ple whenever you want too. None 
of this "I can't attack, I'm on a lad- 
der" stuff. And there's no time lim- 
it. Why should there be, in a game 
that's not coin operated? There's 
an hourglass in the top left corner 
of the screen, but this is just a life 
indicator, complete with a genie 
head next to it that gets steadily 
more alarmed as you get beaten 
up. 

The graphics are magnificent. 
Aladdin's movements are well 
drawn and very fluid, as are all of 
the bad guys. It's all pretty slap- 
stick, jut like the movie - you 
won't see a drop of blood in the 
whole game. The sound is also 
good, but nothing can top the 
graphics. 

Overall, this is a top game, re- 
gardless of its origin. Even if you 
don't like platform games much - 
and I don't - you'll enjoy Aladdin.

The day the music died 
(don't panic - it hasn't 
come yet) 

I In the continuing popular-press 
saga of The Internet And How It 
Will Destroy The World, there's a 
new theme. We've had The 
Pornography Superhighway, and 
The Terrorists' Academy, now it's 
The Death Knell For Popular Mu- 
sic, That's right, folks - the Inter- 
net will kill musicmaking as a 
profitable venture, because horrid 
nefarious people will rip off music 
and distribute it freely on the Net. 
And there won't be a thing anyone 
will be able to do to stop them. 
Woe. Misery. Film at 1 1 . 

Unusually, for a sexy media is- 
sue, the music copyright scare ac- 
tually has some solid grounding to 
it. But it's not a problem yet. 

Here's the deal 

The Internet is, essentially, un- 
regulated. Anyone who can figure 
out how to get on, can. And once 
there, they can do just about any- 
thing. While a number of prosecu- 
tions have been launched against 
people who've sent death threats 
via Internet email, maintained sites 
dealing in child pornography or in 
some other way gone beyond the 
pale, the legal status of the Net re- 
mains very difficult to pin down. 

Music can easily be digitised - 
turned into a computer file. This is 
the whole idea behind sampling, 



one of the definitive features of a 
large portion of late 20th century 
popular music. And computer files 
can easily be propagated freely 
through the Internet. Thus, it 
seems it should be easy to make a 
musician's work freely available to 
the much-touted millions of Inter- 
net users. And if this is what the 
musician wants, all is well. 

The problem 

Unfortunately, most musicians 
are rather keen on selling their mu- 
sic, and getting at least some of the 
profits. They have this silly fixa- 
tion about buying food and paying 
the rent, and can't see beyond it to 
the beautiful world of free enter- 
tainment for all that the Internet is 
striving for. And to stop people 
copying their work willy-nilly, the 
musicians copyright it. And if you 
send copyrighted music all over 
the place for free, you're doing 
something which is very much the 
same as pirating software. 

Copyright infringement on the 
Internet is so widespread as to be 
practically inescapable. In any 
half-hour surf of the World Wide 
Web, I pass a good dozen spots 
where someone could justifiably 
bring an infringement suit, if they 
could be bothered and if the target 
would stand still long enough for 
them to get a shot off. 

There's text and pictures alike - 
all someone has to do is scan it 
and stick it into a directory and be- 
fore you know it 100 people have 
it and 100,000 people have point- 
ers to it and no force on Earth 
could root it out. Practically all of 
those well-publicised pornograph- 
ic pictures are copyrighted to the 
paper publications they originally 
appeared in, but there they are. A 
while ago I found an archive of the 
collected works of Hunter S. 
Thompson. What the father of 
gonzo journalism would do to a 



person whose nimble typing fin- 
gers cut Hunter off from a source 
of royalty money which could fur- 
ther reduce the amount of blood in 
his alcoholstream beggars the 
imagination, but it's never going to 
happen because Mr Thompson's 
never going to find the culprit. 

The Net's full of scanned Far 
Side cartoons, Optical Character 
Recognition-ed Dave Barry pieces, 
reprinted-without-permission news 
paper articles and other chunks of 
other people's work, and nobody 
gets paid a penny. 

But music is not in danger, at 
least yet, and I'll tell you why. 

Land of the humungo-files 

At the moment, online sound 
compression ain't that popular. It's 
a watch-this space sort of proposi- 
tion, what with MPEG sound gain- 
ing momentum, but the most pop- 
ular sound formats these days are 
the straight, uncompressed sample 
formats, all of which are around 
the same size and none of which 
get much smaller when com- 
pressed with standard archiving 
software. What this means is that 
digital audio of any decent quality 
takes up Mondo Room. 

Let's look at a worst case sce- 
nario, just for the sake of the big 
numbers. Let's say you are Evil Pi- 
rate Guy (this name looks pretty 
dumb on your Lycra jumpsuit, so 
you're working on something 
snappier), and you want to send a 
whole CD out to the world, depriv- 
ing its starving creator of the few 
pennies he needs to feed his 19 
crippled children. Nyahahahaha. 

OK, that CD contains, say, 60 
minutes of audio. This audio is two 
channel, 16 bit, 44.1kHz (44,100 
samples per second). So you need 2 
times 16 times 44,100 times 3600 
(the number of seconds in 60 min- 
utes) bits to store the whole thing.

AMIGA Review 






This is 5,080,320,000 bits, or 
635,040,000 bytes, or about 606 
megabytes of data. That's a lot. 
This article's about 1600 words 
long; you could fit this article's 
text into 606 megabytes almost 
400,000 times. Big number. 

You are of course Nasty Copy- 
right Infringement Man (nope, no 
better), so you've got all the snap- 
py new gadgets, including a honk- 
ing fast 64 kilobit ISDN connec- 
tion to the Internet, which in Aus- 
tralia costs a fortune but heck, you 
can afford it after beating up that 
Salvation Army band and stealing 
their collection tin. 

For you to move 635,040,000 
bytes of data at 64,000 bits per 
second will take you some 79380 
seconds, which is a shade over 22 
hours. This is assuming you're 
getting 100 per cent efficiency 
from your ISDN connection, 
which no mortal will ever achieve, 
but what the hey, you're special. 

Now, you're not paying for 
your online time or for the data 
transferred, because you're Roy- 
alty Eating Dude (let's forget 
about this supervillain name, OK?) 
and have made a deal with malev- 
olent aliens that they can use all 
the pre-schoolers they like for 
transgenic manipulation as long as 
they fiddle you free access. But 
anyone that is paying for their net- 
surfing will have just paid one 
heck of a lot more than the price of 
a CD for the privilege of down- 
loading your version. 23 cents for 
a phone call plus $2.20 for the on- 
line time plus $63,50 worth of 
download. Plus the $1000 hard 
disk they need to be able to hold 
the file and still have room for 
their Internet software. 

This, of course, is not a strictly 
fair comparison. For a start, whole 
CDs aren't necessarily being 
ripped off. It could just be a single 
song, say four minutes long, which 



would take a mere 88 minutes or 
so to download at the abovemen- 
tioned unrealistic speed. And 
you'll compress it with one of 
those compressors optimised for 
audio data (so anyone wishing to 
avail themselves of your pirated 
ware will have to find themselves 
the decompressor), and you get the 
sound down to, say, 60% of its 
original size. Huzzah, 53 minutes 
for a four minute tune. 

But remember that ISDN con- 
nections are not the norm. 28,800 
Bps modem connections are not 
even the norm, yet. 14,400 is more 
like it, and the slowdown caused 
by the extreme popularity of nifty 
sites (such as those that offer Top 
40 records for nothing) will likely 
choke back the effective transfer 
rate still further. Before you know 
it, you're looking at a whole-CD 
transfer time, even with compres- 
sion, of around 90 hours. This is 
completely ridiculous. 

You can greatly reduce transfer 
time by cutting the samples back 
to 8 bit, 22.05kHz mono (that's an 
eighth of the size right there) or 
worse, but you end up listening to 
something that sounds like AM ra- 
dio, which is not the first port of 
call for the discerning audiophile. 

It won't heppen overnight... 

So, at the moment, music 
piracy over the Internet is a con- 
cept, not a phenomenon. But will 
it stay that way? Of course not. In 
a scant few years, some sort of 
evolved-lntemet will probably ex- 
ist that you can get onto without 
needing a degree in Advanced Pro- 
peller Beanie Dynamics, and 
which gives everyone blazing fast 
connections - say 128Kbps for 
starters, or maybe Ethernet speeds 
way above a megabit per second. 
Integrated, universally understood 
MPEG audio will hack file sizes 
down by a factor of three, four, 



five - maybe ten. Who knows. 

With quarter-sized audio and a 
2MBps link, you could move a 60 
minute CD in about ten minutes. 
Under a minute for a four minute 
song. At these speeds, it's quite 
possible to play the CD straight 
from the net, just sucking the data 
into your player and not even 
bothering to save it - after all, it'll 
still be there in the future if you 
want it; you can get over this 
childish ownership fixation. 

If it goes this far, Internet mu- 
sic distribution is convenient 
enough to be a real threat to the 
livelihood of the artists, and to the 
continuing supply of hand-rolled 
Cuban cigars and big shiny Ger- 
man-made land yachts for record 
company managers. And this is 
what all the fuss is about. But it's 
not happening now. 

Don't get me wrong - I think 
it's good that the music piracy is- 
sue has been raised so early. Usu- 
ally, legally difficult implications 
of technology are noticed by the 
government only once they have 
well and truly arisen, and changes 
to the law are thus late, clumsy 
and largely ineffectual. I hope that 
the flurry of attention aimed at the 
subject by recent events will actu- 
ally provoke some movement 
among our elected representatives. 

It has been said (by no less a 
light than Bruce Sterling, author of 
the seminal how -they -think and 
what-happens-to-them work The 
Hacker Crackdown) that informa- 
tion wants to be free (man). And 
there aren't any bogeymen in the 
Internet copyright ripoffs - the ma- 
jor culprits are generally in it for 
fame, not profit. But we're still liv- 
ing in a society based on money, 
and, generally speaking, places 
where there isn't any money end up 
deserted. I hope somebody makes 
sure the money stays in music.

I Welcome to another edition of 
Hot PD, This month there's the 
usual mixed hag of useful, amus- 
ing and piain inexplicable software 
for your delectation; let's get into 
it! 

Diamond Caves tV 

The Amiga world, not to put to 
fine a point on it, positively crawls 
with Emerald Mine clones. The 
original game, a very good version 
of the Boulderdash idea, was 
chiefly notable for the fact that it 
spawned the SCA virus (the first 
on the Amiga) wherever it went, 
but if you ignore that character 
flaw the Emerald Mine saga is one 
of remarkable success, as literally 
thousands and thousands of brain- 
melting levels, full of rocks, gems, 
monsters, bombs, dynamite, keyed 
doors, amoebae, lava and fruit 
were created by warped minds 
around the world. And the game 
engine itself has been tweaked for 
different graphic and sound sets, 
and to run on more modern ma- 
chines than the 68000 driven 
Workbench 1.2 OCS Amigas of 
yore. 

What makes Diamond Caves 
different is that the old Emerald 
Mines interface has been parcelled 
into another recoded engine, with 
the spiffiest title screen I've seen 
in a long time and complete and 
flawless compatibility with Kick- 
start 2 and 3 machines. You can 
even play the game in hi-res inter- 
lace mode if you like, which lets 
you see a lot more of the puzzle 



but will drive you bananas if you 
can't manage a flicker free display. 
There's also a game record/ play- 
back mode, so you can demon- 
strate your brilliance or cackhand- 
edness to your friends without lift- 
ing a finger. 

If you register Diamond Caves 
you get, among other things, the 
most impressive looking level edi- 
tor I've ever seen. I include the 
sample screenshot. Nice, huh. 

This is a cool version of a cool 
game. Sure, the graphics are still 
the old chunky stuff, but who 
cares. On the companion disks, of 
course - it takes up a whole one by 
itself. 

Poing tV 

Another game, and another 
good one. I've talked about Poing 
before, the last time only a couple 
of months ago - but this is a major 
update, to Version 3. It's still a left 
to right Breakout game, you still 
have a second chance if you miss 
the ball (try to catch it as it rockets 
back through the previous stages) 
and indeed the game as a whole 
plays much the same, but there are 
a few additions. 

For a start, there's a whole new 
batch of levels, plus all the old 



Program complexity: 

tY The Cat could work this. 

wrtV Lister could do it, if sober. 
£(?tft Kryten could handle it. 
# & &>Y Arnold Rimmer, no. 
Ace Rimmer, yes. 



ones - and you can play them in 
random order if you like. There are 
a few cosmetic changes and bug- 
fixes, and there are also new com- 
mand line options, so you can play 
in easy mode (extra ball every 
10,000 points instead of every 
20,000, but you don't get a high 
score listing), or turn on a thumb- 
nail view of all the screens you've 
visited at the bottom of the play 
area, or even run the game in 
super-turbo mode to watch the 
computer rack up some high scores 
for you to play against. I do mean 
SUPER turbo, by the way. 

SafeRet fc 

The first Damn Fool Program 
in this batch. This one's for every- 
one out there who's realised that 
many of the worst things that can 
happen to your Amiga start with 




Wow THIS is what I call a level editor!

Info datatype -&t>i> 

Here's a simple one - a 
datatype for icons. This means that 
if you've got OS3+, you can now 
load icon files into datatype aware 
programs, as if they were IFF pic- 
tures. Not much more to say about 
it, really. 

Yet Another Picture Viewer. 
First, all of the things JIV does 
that a million and three other pic- 
ture viewers do - it views IFF, JFIF 
(JPG) and GIF87 and some GIF89 
pictures, it has a pile of command 
line options, it can scroll oversized 
images, it dithers pictures with 
more colours than you can display, 
and it can use all standard screen - 
modes, Picasso-II cards (and any 
other 24 bit card with a decent 
Workbench emulation) or an 
A2024 monitor, if you've got one. 
It even views PNM pictures; if you 



don't know what these are you 
don't need to. 

But JIV also views BMP im- 
ages. It is the only Amiga image 
viewer I know of that does, unless 
you're an OS3+ user with a BMP 
datatype. It presently only views 
uncompressed BMPs, but that's 



I UP 11H5 



most of them; most BMP images 
stick with Microsoft's bigger-is- 
better philosophy and don't use the 
compression option. 

Nothing else about JIV is espe- 
cially remarkable; it requires 
WB2. The author promises a fu- 
ture version will show a whole 
load of other image formats, too. 
At last, some decent competition 
for ViewTek. 

Nerv & 

I'm sorry. I can't help it. I have 
this thing for moronic programs. 
Nerv certainly fits the bill; it simu- 
lates using an unregistered share- 
ware program written by someone 
who believes that if an annoying 
register-me requester every now 
and then is good, then one every 
three seconds must be better. 
There's absolutely no reason to run 
it on your own machine, but start- 
ing it up on someone else's, in, for 
example, the startup-sequence un- 
der a different name, could provide 
a few minutes of amusement.

Scale, showing off a minature workbench. 



RDB Informer ■&&& 

This program's aim in life is to 
tell you more than you probably 
want to know about the Rigid Disk 
Block (RDB) data on a hard drive. 
I ran it over my four-partition main 
drive and it pumped out 173 lines 
of information, the bulk of which I 
shan't pretend to understand. 

What use is this? Well, if 
you're stuck in the SCSI wilder- 
ness with a drive that keeps its 
brains in its buttocks, every diag- 
nostic tool you can find helps. You 
can use RDB Informer to see if the 
changes you're making are getting 
to the drive, and also to see if the 
drive has a valid setup, and also to 
make numbers thai make sense to 
wizardly SCSI gurus. It's small, so 
it's on the companion disks. 

Scale £-& 

This is a iens program with a 
difference. Lens programs, as you 
all of course know because you 
read the Hot PD column almost 
three years ago in which I wrote 
about MKSLens, allow you to 
magnify bits of screens. They're 
not dreadfully useful day-to-day, 



but if you need this sort of thing, 
this is the sort of thing you'll need. 

Scale is an enhanced version, 
capable not only of magnifying 
your Workbench or most any other 
screen, but also of displaying a 
miniature version. You can mix 
magnifications, too, so you can set 
the X magnification twice as high 
as the Y value or vice versa and 
see how things look on screens 
with different shaped pixels. How 
useful any of this is is debatable. 

Scale can also do quick-and- 
dirty icon scaling, so you can 
make icons anything from 10% to 
1000% of their original size as 
they're loaded - if you snapshot 
the icons, they stick that way 
(there's a confirm requester to 
avoid accidental saving of monster 
or invisible icons). This, also, is 
novel but not necessarily useful. 
Ah, what the heck, it's on the com- 
panion disks. 

UnDel A^ft 

Here's an unpretentious but re- 
ally fast file undeleter. You run it 
from the command line, you tell it 
the device to look for deleted files 
on and the place to put what it 



finds, and then it scans the disk 
about 75% faster than Amiback 
Tools can manage it, and gives you 
a taggable list of files it found. 
Simple and useful. You need 
Workbench 2 to run it. 

MFS #&& 

Are you troubled by excess 
filesystems? When you stick a disk 
in a drive, does one filesystem say 
"That's the format I recognise!" 
while 17 others put DF0:BAD and 
SDO:??? and VF0:HUH? icons all 
over your screen? Well, you need 
MultiFileSystem! 

MultiFileSystem rolls all of 
your filesystems smoothly togeth- 
er. If you've got a PC disk in your 
first drive and you CD to DFO:, 
MFS calmly figures out the prob- 
lem and puts you in PCO: with no 
drama. There are no annoying ex- 
tra icons. And file systems don't 
have conniptions when one of their 
number inhibits a device for a for- 
mat or a diskcopy. 

By the way, when you start a 
format you get a requester asking 
you which of the filesystems on 
that physical device you'd like to 
use - so you don't have to use the 
shell or dthe actual Format icon to 
reformat, say, an Amiga disk as 
MS-DOS. And also by the way, 
dragging a disk onto another disk's 
icon to start a copy (or even start- 
ing a copy from the shell) will au- 
tomatically use the right filesystem 
for the destination. 

It's easy to set up and reconfig- 
ure, and, in case you didn't figure 
this out yet, you need WB2+. Ev- 
ery home should have it,

More Meeting 
Pearls 



By Daniel Rutter 



t I checked out the first Meeting 
Pearls disc at the end of last year, 
and now another's come along in 
much the same vein. Like the last, 
it's a somefhing-for-e very one disc. 

The question, of course, is is it 
any good? The IBM world's 
swamped with freely distributable 
software CDs that aren't worth the 
buck fifty the makers paid to press 
them; is this a disc you should 
have in your library? 

Well, maybe. You certainly get 
plenty of stuff. Like the last Meet- 
ing Pearls disc, almost everything 
is unarchived and ready to go, gen- 
erally as pre-in stalled as it can be. 
You can run most of the disc's con- 
tents with no mucking about. On 
the downside, this means they only 
fit about half as much on as you 
get with a fuily archived disc, but 
people short on drive space and pa- 
tience will be happy. 

Whaddaya get? 

There's the complete collection 
of Eric Schwartz's sometimes bril- 
liant and always good animations, 
all the common archiving utilities 
including the new LZX, a pack of 
benchmark programs, several up to 
date comms-related programs, and 




a few debugging and development 
utilities including a compiler and 
other stuff for the Oberon lan- 
guage. There's a load of disk tools 
- CD-ROM and SCSI stuff, caches, 
floppy disk utilities, backup pro- 
grams, disk and file editors and so 
on. There's software broadly clas- 
sified as educational, which head- 
ing this time goes against tradition 
by covering some useful programs. 
There are 56 representative 1140 



by 890 fractal images from "The 
Beauty of Chaos Vol. 1", a disc 
produced by Stefan Ossowski's 
Schatztruhe, coincidental ly the 
company that produced the Pearls 
disc as well. There's a decent 
games section, with 14 unarchived 
megabytes of assorted entertain- 
ment software, most of it good. 

There's graphics software - 3D 
object editors and other utilities, 
various Imagine objects, picture

viewers and so on. There's icon 
editors and other manipulators, and 
the inevitable collections of icons. 

There's the Internet Movie 
Database, nicely set up with a 
MagicUserlnterface, uh, interface, 
and lots of info on tons and tons of 
movies. There's almost 40Mb of 
Linux, a good Unix port for the 
Amiga, and MIDI-lovers will find 
more than 6Mb of utilities and 
MIDI files. 

Less well-heeled music lovers 
will find about 25Mb of assorted 
techno SoundTracker modules. 
There are also getting on for 9Mb 
of MODs of various flavours from 
The Party 94, one of the big Euro- 
conventions for Amiga-freaks. The 
Party collection also has quite a lot 
of AGA and ECS chipset intros 
and graphics, but this is by no 
means an exhaustive collection - 
there's only around 1 7Mb in total 
and the complete catalogue of stuff 
that emerged at The Party would 
be way bigger. 

There's a few sound utilities, 
and an updated version of NetB- 
SD, another Amiga Unix which 
should now be more accessible to 
non-wizards - there was a pre- 
release version on the Meeting 
Pearls I disc which was of interest 
only to serious propellorheads. 

There are a load of pictures - 
more than 25Mb of fantasy, Re- 
a!3D and space pictures. These 
vary in vintage abut are all at least 
OK, and you do get a good selec- 
tion of Doctor Fun cartoons, an on- 
line comic heavily derivative of 
The Far Side and occasionally al- 
most as good. 

There's a whole directory for 
people with Psion organisers

AMIGA Review 




tremely miscellaneous text files, 
many Amiga related but many 
rather random. There are sundry 
utilities. And, of course, more. In- 
cluding, you'll be excited to hear, 
more pictures of European 
Amigoids which may prove an ef- 
fective alternative to expensive 
pharmaceutical sedatives for any 
CD-ROM drive owners out there 
stricken with insomnia. 

Not all new 

Not everything on this disc is 
actually all that new - unless 
there's been a very recent update 
you'll get the latest version of all 
the programs, but the latest version 
may well be a couple of years old. 
If you don't have much of a PD 
collection Pearls 2 is a good 
starter, but if you keep up with the 
times there'll be a lot of duplica- 
tion. Not that it's easy to keep EV- 
ERYTHING new on a 650Mb disc. 

The disc's layout's not bad, 
though not as smooth as Aminet's 
lovely Amigaguide hypertext sys- 
tem. There's a rather lumpen 
search system and the programs 
are generally adequately described 
- there aren't many programs with- 
out English documentation. 

Overall 

In the final analysis, if you 
keep up with the Aminet CDs 
there's no compelling reason to get 
Pearls unless this particular assem- 
blage of stuff really turns your 
crank. Just about everything makes 
it onto Aminet, generally very 
swiftly, so give or take a bit there's 
nothing here you won't find there. 
But, as I said, if you don't have 
much already this is a most excel- 
lent starter. And I enjoyed brows- 
ing it. Check it out.

I Let's face it, ten pin bowling is 
not the world's most popular simu- 
lated sport. Sim-golf, yes; sim- 
soccer, certainly, but bowling? 

Well, Team 17, makers of fine 
Amiga games for a long time now, 
have decided to make themselves a 
niche where none previously exist- 
ed - the entertaining bowling 
game. There have been bowling 
games before, for example Strikes 
And Spares back in 1993, but none 
of them have been all that exciting 
- there's not that much to work 
with. 

Team 17 have realised that - 
Kingpin Arcade Sports Bowling, 
to give it its full title, comes on 
just one disk. The disk's non-DOS, 
and you CAN had disk install the 
program, but the installer's lumpen 
and still requires that you boot 
from the original disk - after the ir- 
ritating find the number on the 
black-on-black copy protection se- 
quence the game runs from hard 
disk. 

This is the extent of the annoy- 
ance you'll face with Kingpin, 
though; the game itself is rather 
good. You can use eight, 10, 12, 
14 or 16 pound balls (which are 
the right colour), alleys play at dif- 
ferent speeds and hook different 
ways depending on how they're 
waxed, the pins bounce and tum- 
ble very realistically and you can 



put spin on the ball by moving the 
stick after you position your 
bowler, set power and let fly. 

The only particularly unrealis- 
tic thing about Kingpin is the aim- 
ing procedure - when you decide 
on your power and position you hit 
the button and an an aiming sight 
flicks back and forth on the alley 
in front of you - the more power 
you're using, the faster it moves. 
Press the button again at the wrong 
moment and the gutter will greet 
you. But you get this sort of prob- 
lem with all computer sports 
games; if you want to feel like 
you're really doing it, I'm afraid 
you're going to have to really do 
it. 

There's computer opponents of 
varying difficulties, configurable 
players (handedness, shirt colour 
and handicap), a tricky spares ar- 
cade mode where you try to pick 
up as many of the awkward com- 
binations of pins as you can, and 
of course full running scorekeep- 
ing. The sound is quite good - es- 
pecially the occasional announce- 
ments over the PA ("The bars have 
just closed." "BOOOOOOOO!"). 
And the graphics are simple but 
well drawn. 

If you want a sports sim that's 
a bit out of the ordinary, Kingpin 
could well be for you.

► This game comes from the same 
makers as Aladdin (funny, that), 
and so I had high hopes of it. Al- 
addin may be a platform game at 
heart, but there's always room for 
a really well done genre piece and 
so I was looking forward to play- 
ing The Lion King, in which you 
get to be Simla a, hero of the big 
Disney animated movie. You start 
out playing little baby Simba, and 
in later levels you turn into big bad 
adult Simba. 

Unfortunately, The Lion King 
turned out to be disappointment. 
Sure, the graphics are very pretty 
and the animation nearly as good 
as Aladdin's, but that's where the 
similarity stops. This is, I'm 
afraid, a classic movie license 
game, relying on the pull of the 
film to get its sales. 

One thing I liked about The Li- 
on King is that there's no stupid 
looking up of words in the manual 
- the reason for this could quite 
likely be the fact that there's only 
eight pages in the main manual, 
and one more in the separate get- 
ting started guide. 

Unlike Aladdin's well written 
and funny manual, The Lion 
King's is poorly proofed (appar- 
ently vultures "battack" you) and 
sketchy. And there's still no hard 
disk installer, either. 

The Lion King has all the stan- 



dard cute platform game traits - in 
the early stages you deal with the 
bad guys by jumping on their 
heads or rolling into them, with a 
minimally useful roar attack as 
well (works on some bad guys, 
doesn't work on most, but can be 
powered up). Jumping on some 
bad guys works, but not rolling, 
and vice versa. Thanks to the mini- 
malist manual, you have to learn 
how to deal with monsters by trial 
and error - you can only jump on a 
hyena after he's launched an attack 
and he's standing there panting, 
and you can only jump on a vul- 
ture while it's attacking you, and 
so on. Get it wrong a few times 
and you'll die - then it's back to 
the last savepoint you touched, 
which can be right back at the start 
of the level. Aladdin 'd hack his 
way through all these critters with- 
out breaking a sweat. 

Simba is not very controllable. 
When you tell him to roar, he'll sit 
in one place like a spud while he 
does it and if a bad guy biffs him 
in the meantime, bad luck. 

Likewise, if you decide to do a 
roll, Simba will roll for a set time - 
you can't stop early if you see 
you're rolling somewhere nasty. 
You can't attack while you're in 
the air, and the dodgy collision de- 
tection means you need pinpoint 
accuracy to successfully jump on a

bad guy, and not get spiked. It is 
likewise something of a hit-and- 
miss affair when you're doing the 
inevitable jumps between perilous 
platforms and liny hand ho Ids. The 
Lion King designers are keen on 
bottomless pits, too, so it's not like 
Aladdin where you usually just 
end up a mile back in the level if 
you miss a leap. 

When Simba grows up he can 
do slash and maul attacks, too, but 
it's still clumsy. I've played lots of 
platform games as annoying as this 
one, but that doesn't make it OK - 
Aladdin can do just about anything 
just about any time. 

Aladdin's music and sound ef- 
fects are excellent. The Lion 
King's music is OK, and the effec- 



ts are generic (bleep, boing, ouch J 
and very sparse. These arc the qui- 
etest jungles you're ever going to 
see, folks. 

Overall. The Lion King is cer- 
tainly not the lousiest platform 
game J've ever played - there have 
been some shockers - but com- 
pared with Aladdin it's poor. The 
graphics are great, but that's it. 
Perhaps the console version's bet- 
ter - it's got three extra bonus 
stages lhat didn't fit on the four 
AG A Amiga floppies but are 
nonetheless described (perfuncto- 
rily) in the manual. If your kids 
pester you to buy The Lion King, 
give them a piece of your mind 
and get Aladdin instead.

The Australian 
Graphic Encyclopedia 

for CD32 



By Daniel Rutter 



1 1 know what a multimedia ency- 
clopedia's meant to look like. I've 
played with Encarta 95 on the PC. 
You get tons of pictures, tons of 
text, lots of sounds, a few anima- 
tions, and it's all cross-referenced. 
Click an unusual word and you see 
the definition. Click a city on a 
map and you see its entry. Search 
for anything you like through the 
whole thing. Brilliant. 



The Australian Graphic Ency- 
clopedia for the CD32 doesn't set 
its sights as high as Encarta, not by 
a long chalk. It's the sequel to the 
disk-based Australian Graphic At- 
las, reviewed previously in Amiga 
Review, and it's billed as a com- 
pendium of information about this 
country. 

There's maps, graphics, and in- 
formation on historic buildings, the 



THF 

aU5 1 J&/\JL*l/\iN 




wool industry, wheat, demograph- 
ics, Antarctica, the Pacific islands, 
Prime Ministers and, according to 
the back of the box, much more. 
So what's it like? 

Essentially, the Encyclopedia's 
a collection of menu screens with 
buttons you click to see other in- 
formation - text or graphics. And 
there's quite a lot of that - the CD 
contains some 450Mb of data, 
most of it pictures. 

By the standards of the old 
Graphic Atlas, this is an OK prod- 
uct. But by the standards of mod- 
ern CD encyclopedias, it isn't. 

There's some cross-referencing 
- for example you can gel to the 
mini-biographies of Prime Minis- 
ters by clicking thumbnail images 
of their faces or by clicking on 
their tenure in a timeline - but gen- 
erally speaking it's laid out like a 
tree, not a web. 

Accurate text is essential for 
any encyclopedia, and typos or 
grammatical errors make the read- 
er uncertain of the accuracy of the 
other information. Unfortunately, 
the Graphic Encyclopedia has both 
these symptoms of lousy proof- 
reading - those interested in Feder- 
al politics will be interested to

know that the House of Represen- 
tatives Chamber apparently con- 
tains someone called the "Chirman 
of Committees", and the disc itself 
contains loads of misspelled file- 
names, leftover .bak files appar- 
ently just left lying around because 
there was enough room to keep 
them, and other miscellaneous de- 
bris. It looks to me like the produc- 
ers accidentally released an alpha 
version of the disc, before they'd 
proofed the text and tidied up the 
rubble. 1 can't think of any other 
excuse for black-on-black buttons 
being left in - can you? 

To cap it off, Australian Graph- 
ic Encyclopedia's rather slow, tak- 
ing an alarmingly long time to load 
a simple screen and looping sam- 
ple. I was also originally under the 
impression that the Encyclopedia 
actually crashed quite often when 
moving from one menu to another, 
but I was wrong. It just takes an 
astoundingly long time. How about 
a consistent two minutes forty sec- 
onds just to load the intro screen 
for the "Australia's Pacific Neigh- 
bours" section? 

Australian graphic Encyclope- 
dia's graphics vary from average to 
dire, with a few pictures for every 
subject which can be viewed as a 
slide show. Some of these pictures 
are actually HAM6, too; this image 
quality looked pretty amazing in 
1985 but is well below par today. 

The sound is restricted to loop- 
ing music - no sound bites from 
speeches, no other samples, no 
nothing. If there are any anima- 
tions, I certainly couldn't find 
them. 

The number one sign of a 
dodgy CD, for me, is that a coffee 
table book would do a better job. 
In this case, it'd do a MUCH better 
job.

I With demo parties being the 
main provider of regular demos 
these days, it seems that disk mag- 
azines have become the most pop- 
ular way to fill the release gaps. 
Last month saw three magazines, 
and just one month later there's an- 
other two, one of which is a debut 
issue. 

Vision #1 is the second new 
Australian diskmag to debut in as 
many months. Created by Devious 
Dezigns, Vision is noticeably dif- 
ferent in concept to last month's 
Defy (by Cydonia). 

Whereas Defy was strictly a 
'scene magazine, Vision attempts 
to cover a wider variety of subject 
matter. Whether this broader ap- 
proach is successful is really de- 
pendant on what the reader's inter- 
ests are - and there's much larger 
competition in the "real" magazine 
field for these subjects. 

The demo articles themselves 
are certainly not professionally 
written, but are interesting in the 
same way as those in Defy #1. Pre- 
sentation is quite nice, with some 
cool font/background colour 
schemes and a well presented pan- 
el. The background module is per- 
fect for a diskmagazine too, al- 
though it might grow monotonous 
after a while. 

Vision loses in its lack of mul- 
titasking or any ability to exit back 
to Workbench. This would have 
been acceptable two years ago, but 
we really do expect a lot more 
from a diskmagazine now. Thank- 
fully, Vision is hard drive instal- 



lable, and perhaps we'll see the 
other "system" coding covered in 
later editions. 

For the latest issue (or any back 
issues), you can write to: 

ViSiON, PO Box 390, 
Eaglehawk 3556 



It'll be interesting to see if the 
OZ 'scene can support two disk- 
magazines. The competition might 
even create some inspiration in the 
demo department, which can only 
be a good thing. 

At least Vision works, which is 
more than can be said for ROM #3. 
ROM is a new Euro diskmag 
which has attempted to break the 
diskmagazine mould set by RAW, 
and has succeeded to a large ex- 
tent. However, issue 3 refuses to 
work on anything except a stan- 
dard A1200 - insert lecture on how 
everything should run on all ma- 
chines here - which makes it some- 
what difficult to review. Hopefully 
they will release a fix soon. 



Good graphics slideshows have 
always been something of a rarity, 
so the arrival of "My Friend Dark- 
room" by artist KSS was a pleasant 
surprise. 

KSS, who came 84th in the 
graphics competition at The Party 
94 under the name of Floppy, has a 
much different graphic style to the 
usual demo art. There is a real 
artistic appearance to the pictures, 
in a similar fashion to the pictures 
of RA/Sanity, although the results 
are far different. 

KSS uses lots of dark colours 
mixed with some quite vibrant reds 
and oranges. Lots of purple. His 
subject matter ranges from faces to 
some (rather picturesque) night 
landscapes. The cloud scapes are a 
highlight of his work. 

With all the pictures being orig- 
inal works, My Friend Darkroom 
is quite an impressive package. 
Not all the images aTe great, but 
the ones that are good outweigh 
any negatives by a long way. I 
would certainly recommend any 
budding artists to look out for this 
slideshow.

AMIGA Review 




From one art form to another; 
music. Music modules are easily 
the most common releases in the 
scene, and to a large extent, the 
most popular too. 

There have been numerous CD 
compilations of modules, each 
with a wealth of music taken from 
demos and games, but mainly just 
modules that have been released 
by themselves. A forthcoming CD- 
ROM is attempting to break the 
pattern and contain only un- 
released modules from both the 
Amiga and PC demo scene's best 
musicians. 

The project is being organised 
by Sidewinder - a name familiar to 
some since he has released two 
CDs of his own music; Future 
Shock 1 & 2. Rather than just 
throw the modules (which are writ- 
ten specially for the CD-ROM) on- 
to the disc, this will be ah attempt 
to create the "ultimate multimedia 
module experience". 

Yes, the CD is in fact going to 
venture into that fuzzy world of 
multimedia. There will be a visual 
front end - the Amiga version of 
which is being buiit by Perth coder 
Idea/Megawatts - leading to both 
aural and visual presentations for 
each musician. This will include 
the modules (no surprises there), 
text, animations (MPEG/CDXL), 
along with anything else the musi- 
cian wishes to add to his area. 

There will even be a large 2 
minute long rendered intro anima- 
tion, created by yours truly, with 
character design and modelling by 
the master of Anime, Tomwoof/- 
Megawatts. As far as demo projec- 
ts go, this is a BIG one, and with 
music coming from all the big 
names in Europe, the US and even 
Australia, chances are that the end 
result will be worth it. 

The "between parties" wait is 
over once again, as just recently 
The Gathering 95 was held in Eu- 
rope (the second largest yearly 
party behind The Party). 





Next month I'll look at all the 
big winners and losers from the 
various competitions, as well as 
take a quick look at their experi- 
ment with the "intro" competition.
