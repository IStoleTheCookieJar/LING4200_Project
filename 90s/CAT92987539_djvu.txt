compliance  with  United  Nations  General  Assembly  Resolution  46/215  calling  for

assess,  consider,  and  respond  to  the  economic,  environmental,  and  ethical  issues 
raised  by  the  patenting  of  such  animals. 

Congress  finds  that  the  patenting  of  animals  raises  serious  economic, 
environmental,  and  ethical  issues  not  yet  addressed  by  Congress,  and  that  the 
granting  of  numerous  animal  patents  could  expose  patent  holders  to  revocation  or 
alteration  of  their  patents  and  expose  the  Federal  Government  to  potential 
financial  liability  for  restitution.  Therefore  a  5-year  moratorium  will  be  imposed 
in  which  no  vertebrate  or  vertebrate  animal,  including  a  genetically  engineered

animal,  shall  be  considered  patentable.
