EXPLANATORY NOTES 


Introduction 

The monthly population survey (which is described 
in The Labour Force, Australia (6203.0)) comprises the 
monthly labour force survey and supplementary topics. 
This publication contains some results of a supplementary 
survey run in association with the September 1992 labour 
force survey conducted throughout Australia. 


2. Of the respondents to the labour force survey, those 
who fell within the scope of the supplementary survey 
were asked additional questions. They were asked whether 
they were attending an educational institution and, if so, 
the type of educational institution and the type of atten- 
dance. 


Scope 

3. The scope of this supplementary survey was 
restricted to persons aged 15 to 24 and excluded the fol- 
lowing persons: 


(a) members of the permanent defence forces; 


(b) certain diplomatic personnel of overseas govern- 
ments, customarily excluded from census and 
estimated populations; 


(c) overseas residents in Australia; 


(d)members of non-Australian defence forces (and 
their dependants); 


(©) persons permanently unable to work; 
(f) some patients in hospitals and sanatoriums; and 
(g) inmates of reformatories, gaols etc. 


Coverage 

4. In the population survey, coverage rules are applied 
which aim to ensure that each person is associated with 
only one dwelling, and hence has only one chance of 
selection. See The Labour Force, Australia (6203.0) for 
more details. 


Definitions 

5. Definition of labour force and demographic clas- 
sifications appearing in this publication are given in The 
Labour Force, Australia (6203.0). 


6. Unless otherwise stated, all characteristics referenced 
in this publication relate to the week before the interview 
(i.e. the reference week). 


Results of the Survey 

7. Due to differences in the method of estimation used 
in this supplementary survey and that used in the labour 
force survey, there are some small variations between es- 
timates in this publication and those in the corresponding 
issue of The Labour Force, Australia (6203.0). 


8. The estimates in this publication refer to information 
collected in the survey month and, due to seasonal factors, 
may not be representative of other months of the year. 


9. Results of similar surveys, conducted annually since 
September 1988, have been given in previous issues of 
this publication. 


10. This survey will be conducted next in September 
1993. 


Comparability of series estimates 

11. When comparing estimates of attendance between 
May and September, particularly for schools, it should be 
noted that approximately one third of 14 year olds turn 15 
between the two surveys, thus coming within the scope of 
the survey and boosting the September estimates. Because 
attendance estimates amongst 24 year olds are relatively 
small there is little corresponding loss among 24 year olds 
turning 25 between surveys. 


Unpublished tables 

12. As well as the statistics included in this and related 
publications, the ABS may have other relevant un- 
published data available. Inquiries should be made to Ms 
Nicolle Wittmann on Canberra (06) 252 6578. 


Reliability of the estimates 

13. Estimates in this publication are subject to sampling 
and non-sampling errors. For more information refer to 
the Technical Note. 


Estimation procedure 

14. The estimates are derived from the population survey 
by use of a ratio estimation procedure which ensures that 
the estimates conform to an independently estimated dis- 
tribution of the population for each capital city and 
remainder of State by age, labour force status and sex, 
rather than to the corresponding distribution within the 
sample itself.

TECHNICAL NOTE 


Estimation procedure 


Since the estimates in this publication are based on 
information obtained from occupants of a sample of 
dwellings, they are subject to sampling variability, that is, 
they may differ from those that would have been 
produced if all dwellings had been included in the survey. 
One measure of the likely difference is given by the 
Standard error, which indicates the extent to which an 
estimate might have varied by chance because only a 
sample of dwellings was included. There are about two 
chances in three that a sample estimate will differ by less 
than one standard error from the number that would have 
been obtained if all dwellings had been included, and 
about nineteen chances in twenty that the difference will 
be less than wo standard errors. Another measure of the 
likely difference is the relative standard error, which is 
obtained by expressing the standard error as a percentage 
of the estimate. 


2. Space does not allow for the separate indication of 
the standard errors of all estimates in this publication, A 
table of standard errors for general application is given on 
the following page. Since they are averages based on 
calculations for a limited number of past surveys over a 
wide range of labour force characteristics these numbers 
will not give a precise measure of the standard error of a 
particular estimate but they will provide an indication of 
its magnitude. 


3. An example of the calculation and the use of 
standard errors in relation to estimates of persons is as 
follows. Table 1 shows the estimated number of persons 
aged 15 to 24 who, in September 1992, were attending a 
TAFE as 237,100. Since this estimate is between 200,000 
and 300,000 in the standard error table, the standard error 
for Australia will be between 6,200 and 7,300 and can be 
approximated by interpolation as 6,600 (rounded to the 
nearest 100). Therefore, there are about two chances in 
three that the value that would have been produced if all 
dwellings had been included in the survey will fall within 
ihe range 230,500 to 243,700 and about nineteen chances 
in twenty that the value will fall within the range 223,900 
to 250,300. This example is illustrated in the following 
diagram.

223.9 ae 





2 chances in 3 that the

4. As can be seen from the standard error table, the 
smaller the estimate the higher is the relative standard 
error. Very small estimates are thus subject to such high 
standard errors (relative to the size of the estimate) as to 
detract seriously from their value for most reasonable 
uses. In the tables in this publication only estimates with 
relative standard errors of 25 per cent or less and 
percentages based on such estimates are considered 
sufficiently reliable for most purposes. However, estimates 
and percentages with larger relative standard errors have 
been included and are preceeded by an asterisk (e.g. *3.4) 
to indicate they are subject to high standard errors and 
should be used with caution. 


5, Proportions and percentages formed from the ratio of 
two estimates are also subject to sampling errors. The size 
of the error depends on the accuracy of both the 
numerator and the denominator. A formula to approximate 
the relative standard error (RSE) of a proportion is given 
below: 


RSE (x/y) = VIRSE (0) - IRSE ()/? 


6. Considering the example from paragraph 3 above, 
the 237,100 persons represent 37.6 per cent of the 630,100 
persons aged 15 to 24 who were aitending tertiary 
institutions in September 1992. The standard error of 
630,100 is approximately 9,200 so the relative standard 
error is 1.5 per cent. The relative standard error for 
237,100 is 2.8 per cent, Applying the above formula, the 
relative standard error of the proportion is V(2.8)* - (1.5) 
or 2.4 per cent, giving a standard error for the proportion 
(37.6 per cent) of 0.9 percentage points. Therefore, there 
are about two chances in three that the proportion of 
persons aged 15 to 24 who were attending a TAFE in 
September 1992 is between 36.7 per cent and 38.5 per 
cent and nineteen chances in twenty the proportion is 
within the range 35.8 per cent to 39.4 per cent. 


7. Published estimates may also be used to calculate the 
difference between two survey estimates (of numbers or 
percentages). Such an estimate is subject to sampling 
error. The sampling error of the difference between two 
estimates depends on their standard errors and the 
relationship (correlation) between them, An approximate 
standard error (SE) of the difference between two 
estimates (x-y) may be calculated by the following 
formula: 


SE (xy) = VISE (OF + [SE (y)P 


While this formula will only be exact for differences 
between separate and uncorrelated characteristics of 
subpopulations it is expected to provide a good 
approximation for all differences likely to be of interest in 
this publication,

8. The imprecision due to sampling variability, which is 
measured by the standard error, should not be confused 
with inaccuracies that may occur because of imperfections 
in reporting by interviewers and respondents, and errors 
made in coding and processing data. Inaccuracies of this 
kind are referred to as the non-sampling error, and they 


STANDARD ERRO! 


may occur in any enumeration, whether it be a full count 
or a sample. Every effort is made to reduce the 
non-sampling error to a minimum by careful design of 
questionnaires, intensive training and supervision of 
interviewers and efficient operating procedures.
