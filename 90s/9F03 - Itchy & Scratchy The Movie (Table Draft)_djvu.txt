ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
ON TV 


An overweight aging Star Fleet CAPTAIN sits in his chair on 
a starship. 


CAPTAIN 
Captain’s log Stardate 6051: had 
trouble sleeping last night. 
Breakfast was good but the bacon was 
fatty; the ship is drafty and damp; I 
complain but nobody listens. 
ANNOUNCER (V.0O.) 
“Star Trek XII - Ready for Death". 
They’re back in their latest, 
greatest adventure. 


An aging, Oriental HELMSMAN, with a cane, addresses the 
Captain. 


HELMSMAN 
Captain, Klingons off the starboard 
bow! 
CAPTAIN 
(WEARY) Again with the Klingons. Mr. 
Scott, give me full power. 
INT. STARSHIP ENGINE ROOM 


We see an extremely fat Chief Engineer. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


CHIEF ENGINEER 
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) It’s no good, 
Captain, I can’t reach the control 
panel! 
He struggles but is too fat to reach the switches. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE LIVING ROOM 
BART, LISA and GRAMPA have been watching this. 
BART 
Hey, Scotty’s lost weight. 
GRAMPA 
(SNORTS) Movies! What a rip-off. 
Bart and Lisa turn and look at Grampa. 
GRAMPA (CONT’D) 
Do you know how much they charge to 
get into a movie these days? A 
dollar! 
LISA 
Five dollars. 
GRAMPA 
(WASN’T LISTENING) That’s right. 
Why, when I was a boy you could get 
into a double feature for a nickel, 
and between films they had the best 
damn freak show you ever saw. 
BART 


Wow, a nickel. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


BART’S DAYDREAM 
In a sepia tinted scene, Bart, wears a Jughead hat and 
1926-style kids’ clothes. The marquee of the Springfield 
Biograph says, "Vilma Banky in ‘THE DARK ANGEL‘" and below 
that: "Plus Live Freaks". Bart hands the TICKET TAKER a 
five dollar bill. 
BART 
This is for me and the next ninety- 
nine people in line. 
TICKET TAKER 
(IMPRESSED) Yes SIR! 
CROWD 
Hip, Hip, Hooray! 
BACK TO SCENE 
BART 
Grampa, who’s Vilma Banky? 
GRAMPA 
How the hell should I know? Just 
because I’m old don’t mean I know 
everybody. I don’t have to sit here 
and take this. (FALLS ASLEEP, 
SNORES). 


MARGE and HOMER enter and begin putting on their coats. 
They are dressed to the nines. 


BART 


Hubba hubba! Oh you kid! 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


MARGE 
Thank you, dear. Now you two be good 
for Grampa while we’re at the 
parent/teacher meeting. We’1l bring 
back dinner. 
LISA 
What are we going to have? 
HOMER 
That depends on what kind of report 
we get from your teachers. If you’ve 
been good....Krusty Steak Sandwiches 
with all the trimmings. If you’ve 
been bad...uh...(THINKS)...let’s 
see...what wouldn’t they like... 
poison. 
LISA 
What if one of us has been good and 
one of us has been bad? 
BART 
Poison steak sandwiches. 
HOMER 
Oh no. I’m not making two stops. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT 
Marge and Homer are standing on the steps of the school. A 
large banner over the doorway says "Parent/Teacher Night - 
Let’s Share the Blame". SKINNER is greeting a GROUP OF 
PARENTS as they walk through the door. Near him, looking 


uncomfortable in a fancy dress kilt is GROUNDSKEEPER 
WILLIE. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


HOMER 
I’1l talk to Lisa’s teacher this 
year. You can have Bart’s. 
MARGE 
That’s the way we do it every year. 
This time... 
HOMER 
Please Marge...pleassssssssse. 
Marge makes a face. 
MARGE 
Oh, all right. 
HOMER 
Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! 
They go inside the school 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL = LISA’S CLASS = NIGHT 


PARENTS are sitting in their children’s desks. Homer 
PAINFULLY WEDGES himself into Lisa’s desk. 


HOMER 
(MILD CUSSING) 


MISS HOOVER has her back turned to the class. Homer notices 
this and makes a couple of FART SOUNDS with his hands. 


Miss Hoover turns quickly and looks at the parents. Homer 
is looking straight ahead, totally innocent. All of the 
other parents are looking at Homer. Miss Hoover turns back 
to the board. 

HOMER 


(TO SELF) Hee hee! The perfect crime. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


INT. SCHOOL - BART’S CLASS - NIGHT 
PARENTS are seated at their children’s desks. Marge is 
seated next to MRS. KRABAPPEL at her desk. Mrs. Krabappel 
is PULLING OUT homemade weapons, novelty items of all 
descriptions, terrible looking homework etc. from a number 
of boxes labeled "Bart". 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 

Over the past three months, Bart has 

been guilty of the following 

atrocities: (READING) xeroxing 

buttocks: three violations; swearing: 

twelve violations; swearing in sign 

language, three violations; looking 

under girl’s dresses: only one 

violation, but he was under there for 

five minutes. I think he knows more 

than I do now. 

MARGE 
Yes...well...I‘/m sure Bart doesn’t 
really mean to be bad. 


INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


Grampa is SOUND ASLEEP on the couch. Bart, Lisa and MAGGIE 
are standing over hin. 


BART 
Now’s our chance to be bad. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LISA’S CLASS ~- NIGHT 
Miss Hoover is talking to JANEY’S PARENTS while the other 


parents are looking at various projects made by their 
children. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


RALPH’S FATHER 
Miss Hoover! Mr. Simpson is kicking 
me! 

HOMER 
I am not! 


Miss Hoover walks over to Homer’s desk. Homer cowers a 
little. 


MISS HOOVER 
I just wanted to let you know that 
you’ve done a wonderful job with 
Lisa. 
HOMER 
I have? 
MISS HOOVER 
Qh yes. You must have been reading to 
her at a young age. 
Homer tries to remember doing this. 
HOMER’S MEMORY 


BABY LISA is in Homer’s lap on the couch. He is reading to 
her. 


HOMER 
(READING) Eight o’clock...Happy Days. 
The Fonz (Henry Winkler) is worried 
he’s losing his cool. (TURNS PAGE) 
Eight thirty...oooh! Laverne & 


Shirley! 


7. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


BACK TO SCENE 
HOMER 
(PLEASED) I did! I did read to her, 
every night! 
MISS HOOVER 
I was trying to figure out what 
comment to put on her last report 
card and the best I could do was "she 
dignifies our species". God bless 
you. You’re a great man. 
HOMER 
Like Mother Theresa? 
MISS HOOVER 
Better than Mother Theresa. 
HOMER 
Wow. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BART’S CLASS - NIGHT 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Now, we don’t usually do this, but we 
have some witnesses. Come in, Arthur. 


ARTHUR comes in. He looks shaken. Mrs. Krabappel hands him 
a doll that looks remarkably like him. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL (CONT’D) 
Now where did Bart stick the 
fireworks? 


The boy starts to point. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


Grampa’s false teeth are LOLLING about in his mouth as he 
sleeps. Bart reaches a hand towards the teeth. 


BART 
Over the lips and past the gums, 
lookout dentures, here I come. 


Bart REACHES into Grampa’s mouth, EXTRACTS the false teeth 
and STICKS them in his own mouth. 


LISA 
Ew! 
Bart turns and smiles at Lisa and Maggie. Lisa GIGGLES. 
The false teeth are far too big for him, and he now has the 
biggest scariest smile in the world. Maggie is immediately 
frightened and hides behind a chair. 
BART 
(SING SONG) Maggie! Come here Maggie! 
I just want a little taste. 
Bart advances towards Maggie, CLICKING his teeth nastily. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LISA’S CLASS - NIGHT 


Miss Hoover pulls a bumper sticker out of her desk drawer 
and hands it to Homer. 


HOMER 
(READING THE BUMPER STICKER ALOUD) 
“My child is on the Honor Roll at 
Springfield Elementary." You know, 
I’ve searched long and hard for a 
replacement for my "Where’s the Beef" 
bumper sticker. Heh, heh...."Where’s 
the Beef" 


Homer starts to exit with Lisa’s desk around his waist. 


9. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


MISS HOOVER 
Uh... we’d like the desk back Mr. 
Simpson. 

HOMER 
Huh? (LOOKS DOWN) Oh. 


Homer gets out of the desk, hands it to Miss Hoover and 
exits. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A scared Maggie is racing around the house. After a beat, 
we see Bart THUNDERING around the corner after her, 
SNAPPING his huge teeth and CLICK-CLACKING maniacally. 
Maggie desperately hurls a small doll at Bart. Bart 
catches it and bites its head off with a SNAP. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BART’S CLASS - NIGHT 
Marge gets a bumper sticker from Mrs. Krabappel that reads, 
"My child is a problem child at Springfield Elementary." 
Outside the classroom, a pleased Homer looks through the 
window in the door. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Frankly, I wouldn’t care if Bart 
didn’t learn anything as long as he 
kept his mouth shut. He/’s 
disruptive, selfish and rude. 
HOMER 
(BANGING ON DOOR) Come on Marge, I’m 
ready to go! 
MARGE 


Homer, we have a problem here. 


10. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


HOMER 
Are you kidding? Lisa turned out 
perfect. (GROWING ANGRY) I won’t 
stand here and listen to you bad- 
mouthing Lisa! 

MARGE 
We're talking about Bart. 

HOMER 
Oh. That guy. 

MRS. KRABAPPEL 
I think the problem here is 
discipline. If he does something 
wrong you should punish him. I 
believe that with consistent 
discipline even the poorest student 
can end up becoming...oh...say Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court. 

HOMER 


Hmm... 


DREAM DISSOLVE TO: 


Bart wearing an English Barrister’s wig and black robe sits 
at a bench. Homer looks on proudly. Ned Flanders looks on 


BART 
Ned Flanders, for getting on my Dad's 
nerves, I sentence you to hang by the 


neck until dead.

HOMER 

(TO MRS. KRABAPPEL) Lady, you got 

yourself a deal. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE =- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


Bart is BITING LP’s in half with Grampa’s false teeth. He 
hears the car doors SLAM outside. 


BART 
Uh oh. 
Bart turns as he says this and the false teeth SLIP out of 
his mouth onto the hearth and BREAK into a half a dozen 
pieces. 
BART (CONT’D) 
Gah! 


Bart stares at the broken teeth. Close up of Homer and 
Marge’s feet coming up the walk. 


Bart hurriedly tapes the false teeth back together and 
shoves the whole mess into Grampa’s mouth. There’s no time 
to be subtle about this and Grampa wakes up SPUTTERING as 
the door OPENS and Homer and Marge enter. 
GRAMPA 
(SPUTTERING) What? Whazzat? 


Bart is seated casually on the couch, reading an upside 
copy of the Bible and GASPING for breath. 


BART 
Hi mom. Hi dad. (BEAT) Home already? 
Boy, time flies when you’re reading 


the... (CHECKS BOOK) Bible? Ew. 


12. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


Bart tosses the Bible o.s. 
MARGE 
Well, we brought some pizza. 


Homer and Marge carry the pizzas into the kitchen as Grampa 
struggles with his false teeth. 


INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - NIGHT 
GRAMPA 
(ANGRY INDECIPHERABLE ACCUSATIONS) 
HOMER 
If you don’t start making more sense 
we’re going to have to put you ina 
home. 


Grampa yanks at his false teeth until they finally come out 
with a STICKY SOUND. 


GRAMPA 

You already put me in a home. 
HOMER 

(BAD MOOD) Then we’1l put you in the 

crooked home we saw on "60 Minutes" 
GRAMPA 

(SMALL VOICE) I’11 be good. 

ON HOMER 


He opens up one of the pizza boxes. Off screen there is a 
FLURRY OF ACTIVITY and a bunch of STICKY TAPE SOUNDS. 


GRAMPA (0S) 
Dog gone it! 
ON GRAMPA 
He has gotten his false teeth STUCK to his forehead. 


13. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


MARGE 


(EXASPERATED) Oh Grampa! 


Marge helps PULL the teeth off Grampa’s head. She looks at 
the sticky mess of tape and teeth. 


Marge and 


GRAMPA 
Look what your bad egg of a son did 
to my teeth! 
Homer look at the teeth, then at Bart. 
HOMER 
Oh well, boys will be boys. Let’s 
eat pizza!! 
MARGE 
Homer, what did Bart’s teacher just 
tell us? 
HOMER 
Oh, yeah. (TO BART) Young man, you 
know the rules. Only Grampa is 
allowed to play with his teeth. So 
you must be punished. Now go to bed 
without your dinner. 
BART 
(COCKILY) Okay. Can I take some pizza 
upstairs with me? 
HOMER 
Sure. What kind do you want? We’ve 
got sausage, pepperoni, cheese... 
MARGE 


Homer! 


14. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


HOMER 
Bart! Go to your room! No pizza! 
BART 
Yeah, right. Like you‘re going to let 
me go hungry. That’1l be the day. 
I’1l be eating that pizza in five 
minutes. 
MARGE 
(SHARPLY. WITHOUT THINKING) Bart! 
Stop being confident. 
BART 
(CONFIDENTLY) 10-4, baby. 
Bart exits the kitchen. Grampa puts a slice of pizza into a 
blender, GRINDS it up, POURS the pizza into a glass and 
SIPS it with a straw. He makes a face. 
GRAMPA 
Pizza isn’t good this way. 
INT.- SIMPSON HOUSE - BART’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bart is laying on his bed reading a comic book. 
BART 
(LOUD) I’m starving! Somebody bring 
me some food, quick! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT

HOMER

Bart is sitting at a small card table next to his bed. He’s 
holding a knife and fork. He has a napkin tucked in his 


shirt. 


There’s a flower in a small vase on the table. 
BART 
(LOUD) I feel so weak! (WEAKLY) 
Mother of mercy! Is this the end of 


Bartholomew? 


Bart ROLLS a bowling ball off his dresser onto the floor. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 


Homer and Marge look up from their pizza. Homer looks 
horrified. 


INT. 


HOMER 
(HORRIFIED. MOUTH FULL.) Oh my god! 
He’s fainted! 

MARGE 
He’s only been without food for 
twelve minutes, Homer. 

HOMER 
But I’m starving and I’ve had four 
pieces. There’s a big piece in my 
mouth right now. 

MARGE 


He’ll be all right. 


SIMPSON HOUSE = BART’S BEDROOM - TWO HOURS LATER 


Bart is looking through the piles of stuff in his room for 
something edible. 


16. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


BART 
There must be something to eat around 
here. 
He finds nothing, then looks up and sees Santa’s Little 
Helper. The dog BACKS UP with a "No! For God’s sakes I’m 
your dog!" expression on his face. 


BART’S POV 


Santa’s Little Helper turns into a cooked dog with an apple 
in its mouth. 


ON SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER 

He lets out a small YELP and DASHES out of the room.

Homer is astounded.

We see a close-up of SCRATCHY’S face, staring at the 
camera, looking dimwitted, his tongue hanging out. Suddenly 
two mouse fingers come in and POKE him in the eyes. Then 
his head gets SHAVED, his face is SCRIBBLED on with magic 
marker, he gets a screwdriver RAMMED into one ear and out 
the other, two fingers appear mockingly behind his head, 
then a huge gun comes into frame and BLOWS OFF the very top 
of his skull. After a beat, ITCHY JUMPS into the skull and 
begins RIPPING out handfuls of Scratchy’s brain and tossing 
them in the air like confetti.

front of the dog’s face. 
HOMER 
Let go of me and I/1l give you this

cleaned to my satisfaction. 


Homer examines the following:

HOMER (CONT’D) 
Dust swept under the rug... toys 
erammed in closet... dirty clothes 
balled up and shoved behind

unmade bed... Son, I couldn’t have 
done better myself. 
BART 
Thank you, sir. 
Homer tousles Bart’s hair. 
HOMER 
Now run along and play, ya little

BART 
Should I be back before dark?

other kids think. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD 
WORKMEN are putting the finishing touches on an Itchy & 
Scratchy Movie billboard that has a moving Itchy bringing 
down an old fashioned movie camera on Scratchy’s head. Each 
time he’s hit, blood squirts out of Scratchy’s ears. The 
ground below the sign is already covered in blood. A 
convertible with a BRIDE and GROOM drives underneath. 
Blood SQUIRTS out all over the woman’s white dress. They 
look upset, then realize it’s a billboard for Itchy & 
Scratchy and LAUGH.

punished. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE = GARAGE = A LITTLE LATER 


Bart rolls out from under Homer’s car. His face has grease

BART 
I changed the oil, replaced the plugs 
and turned the odometer back to zero. 
HOMER 
Better make it fifty. Don’t want to 
arouse suspicion.

Hey, Homer. Check out this crease.

Bart stands the pair of trousers up. They WOBBLE and we 
hear a SAWBLADE sound. Marge and Lisa enter with shopping 
bags. 
MARGE 
We're home. 
LISA 
(EXCITED) We got beets! 
HOMER 
Look Marge! Look what I can do. Bart! 
Get me the paper. 
Bart goes out the front door, looks around, comes back in, 
looks around the living room, sees the paper, pulls it out 
from under Homer’s butt and hands it to him. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
Now bring me...(LOOKS AROUND)...that 
dog. 


Bart picks up Santa’s Little Helper and carries him to 
Homer. Homer takes the dog. 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
The dog pleases me not. Take him 
away. (CLAPS TWICE) 

Bart takes the dog away. 

LISA 
Aye carumba! 

HOMER 
(CHEERFUL) And it’s all thanks to 
consistency. If Bart doesn’t do what 
I say, he gets a punishment that’s 


sure, swift and cruel.

CARL 
That reminds me, Homer. You were 
supposed to replace those warning 
lights in sector 7-F. Now there’s a 
guy trapped in there. 
HOMER 
I’1l get around to it. Hey, I’ve got 
a great idea. Why don’t you start

ON TV 
We see a smiling CHUBBY MAN sitting in a chair. After a 
beat, thinking the cameras are off, he sneaks a quick bite 
of a candy bar. ON TV, we CUT TO: 
A still of Itchy & Scratchy shaking hands. WIDEN to see 
Itchy’s other hand holds a pair of scissors, which are 
about to cut a rope which is holding a safe over Scratchy’s 
head. 
KENT BROCKMAN (V.0O. CONT’D) 
But first we’ll examine the growing 
Itchy & Scratchy mania with the

Maggie is in the sink taking a bath. Bart is washing her 
hair. 


BART 
I’m watching Maggie. 
LISA (0.S.) 
It’s about the Itchy and Scratchy 
Movie. 
Bart rapidly towels Maggie off, SLAPS on a diaper, brushes 
her hair with two strokes, pulls her night-shirt over her 
head and hangs her on the door knob. 
BART 
(TO MAGGIE) Stay. 
Bart runs out of the roon. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
ON TV 
We see Kent Brockman standing in the middle of a large room 
surrounded by hundreds of animation tables. Korean 
animators are frantically DRAWING Itchy & Scratchy. Armed 
soldiers stand over them, occasionally PRODDING them with 
bayonets. 
KENT BROCKMAN 
I’m here live in Korea to give you a 
first hand look at how American 
cartoons are made. But first, let’s 
take a look back at the year 1928. A 
year when you might have seen Al 
Capone dancing the Charleston on top 
of a flagpole. 


We see CAPONE dancing on top of a flagpole. He falls off. 


29. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


SUPER: DRAMATIZATION 
KENT BROCKMAN (CONT’D) 
It was also the year of the very 
first Scratchy cartoon entitled "That 
Happy Cat". 


Kent holds a framed cel. It shows a happy, black and white 
Scratchy strolling down the avenue. 


CU OF THE PICTURE 


It begins to move. We hear an old JAZZ SONG called "Krazy 
Kat". Scratchy smiles as he walks down the street. He tips 
his hat to OTHER CATS. He stops, puts his hands in his 
pockets, rocks back and forth on his heels, pushes his hat 
to a slightly more rakish angle, then continues his 
promenade. QUICK ABRUPT CUT to card that says "The End." 


KENT BROCKMAN 
The film did very poorly. But the 
following year Scratchy was teamed up 
with a psychotic young mouse named 
Itchy and cartoon history was made. 
Here’s their first cartoon together: 
“Steamboat Itchy". 


Kent holds up a black and white picture of Itchy whistling 
and driving a steamboat. 


CU OF THE PICTURE 


It begins moving. Itchy is bouncing up and down constantly 
and WHISTLING as he SPINS the wheel of the steamboat. He 
pulls a cord, SOUNDING the whistle. Scratchy appears behind 
him, puts his hands in his pockets, rocks back and forth on 
his heels, shoves his hat forward at a more rakish angle. 
Itchy looks around and spies a barrel labelled 
“PORCUPINES". A dotted line goes from his eye to the 
barrel. A light bulb goes off over his head. Itchy grabs 
Scratchy, tosses him in the barrel and shakes it up. 


30. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


SFX: SNARLING, CAT HOWLS 

Itchy pulls Scratchy out of the barrel. He is now filled 
with holes. He continues to put his hands in his pockets 
and rocks back and forth on his heels. Scratchy tips his 
hat and his head falls off. 

TITLE CARD: THE END 

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Bart and Lisa are LAUGHING. Homer comes in and OPENS UP a 
beer. 


ON TV 
We see Itchy & Scratchy FIGHTING with HITLER. 
KENT BROCKMAN (V.O.) 
During the war Itchy & Scratchy put 
their differences aside and teamed up 
to fight a bigger foe. 
Itchy CHOPS Hitler’s head off. Itchy & Scratchy shake 
hands, then Itchy CHOPS Scratchy’s head off. Franklin D. 
Roosevelt runs up and begins KICKING Hitler and Scratchy. 
Itchy holds up a sign that says "SAVE SCRAP IRON." 
HOMER 
(KNOWLEDGEABLY) That was the turning 
point in the war. 
ON KENT BROCKMAN 


A mortise appears on his left of a real mouse and a real 
cat. 


KENT BROCKMAN 
We'll be back with a real life Itchy

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY 


Maggie has somehow backed the car down the driveway and is 
CRUISING slowly off down the street.

Maggie is turning the steering wheel in a rather childish 
manner. The car is weaving all over the road. Maggie flips 
on the radio and "LITTLE OLD LADY FROM PASADENA" begins

He gives Maggie an "Up Yours" gesture. Maggie gives an "Up 
Yours" gesture back. 


ANOTHER STREET 
Maggie’s car SMASHES into the wall of the Springfield 
Correctional Institute, knocking a big hole in it. An air 
bag comes out, saving Maggie. She snuggles into it and 
falls asleep. CONVICTS run out. 
JAILBIRD 
All rrright. Time for a crime spree. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
Maggie is home and being fawned over by everyone except 
Bart, who is standing off to one side, still looking very 
embarrassed. Homer turns on Bart angrily. 
HOMER 
You’re going to have to be punished 
big for this, boy. I know... you 
can’t go to see that Itchy & Scratchy 
movie. Ever! 
BART 
(SHOCKED) Why? What’d I do?

Bart is staring at Homer, aghast. Marge and Lisa also look 
appalled. 


LISA 
Dad, we all agree Bart should be 
punished, and punished severely... 

BART 
Hey! 

LISA 
..».ebut you can’t do this to him. He 
loves Itchy & Scratchy. Every cell 
in body is screaming to see this 
movie. 

HOMER 
I’ve already said he can’t go. And 
I’m not going to change my mind. I 
can’t. I’m Mr. Consistency! 


Homer points to his car in the driveway. We can see his new 
vanity license plate which says "Mr Consi". 


MARGE 
Well, maybe we could give him a 
different punishment. I could bake a 
pie and then not give him any. 

BART 
I got it! No PBS for a month. 


That’1l fix my little red wagon.

EXT. SPRINGFIELD AZTEC THEATER = DAY 


The marquee reads, “Itchy & Scratchy Movie - - Opens 
Today!!" 

Pan down and across a long line of people, many of them 
kids, waiting to see the movie. The line snakes around the 
block and down the street, then through a cemetery (where 
it drops down into an open grave and out again) across an 
airport runway (an airplane attempting to land has to pull 
up), across "Discount Lion Safari" (lions poke at nervous 
queuers), past a stadium where a billboard reads "Beatles 
Reunion with Special guest Led Zeppelin" 


Three BRITISH MUSICIANS are standing outside the stadium 
doors. 


1ST BRITISH MUSICIAN 
Come on in, luv. 

2ND BRITISH MUSICIAN 
Plenty of seats up front. 

3RD BRITISH MUSICIAN 
You can jam with the band! 


The line comes to an end. Lenny is the last person. A man 
steps up behind Lenny. 


LENNY 
Ha, Ha! 


Pull back to see the line ends in front of Bart’s house. 
Bart sadly looks out of the window.

HOMER 
Someday you’1l thank me for this, 


son. 


36. 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


BART 
Yeah sure. 
HOMER 
No, it’s true. You know, when I was 
a boy I really wanted a catcher’s 
mitt. But, my dad wouldn’t get it 
for me. Then when I was grown up, I 
thought about what he’d done and ...I 
put him in a home. (CHUCKLE) Ah, 
sweet revenge. 
BART 
Dad can I please go to the movie? 
HOMER 
I’m afraid not, son. But you’re 
welcome to watch anything you want on 
Tv. 
BART 
TV sucks. 
HOMER 
(BARELY CONTAINING HIS ANGER) I know 
you’re upset right now, so I’/11 
pretend you didn’t say that. 
Bart turns the TV on and sees MAYOR QUIMBY standing on the 
podium with his arms around life-size versions of Itchy & 
Scratchy. 
QUIMBY 
I hereby proclaim this day to be 


Itchy & Scratchy Day! 


9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


The small crowd cheers. Itchy HITS Quimby in the head with 
a foam rubber mallet. 


QUIMBY 
Ow! (LOW. TO ITCHY) Do that again and 
you’ll be eating cheese through a 
tube. 
ITCHY 
Hee hee! Sor-ry! 
Bart changes the channel. 
INT. ON STAGE AT THE KRUSTY SHOW = DAY 


Krusty is PACING around the stage, smoking a cigarette and 
glowering at the kids in the audience. 


KRUSTY 
I used to own 40% of Itchy and 
Scratchy. You know how much I sold it 
for? Bupkis! 
The kids look baffled. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
I tell you I’m the worst businessman 
ever...do you realize that sideshow 
Mel - - who’s been in this business 
for less than three years - - is 
making more money than I am? 
Krusty starts pushing Mel. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Aren’tcha’? Aren’tcha’? Admit it! 


Krusty starts HITTING Mel with the flat of his hand. The 
kids in the audience laugh and applaud. 


Bart changes the channel.

Bart shuts his eyes. A thought bubble forms showing a 
mailman sorting the mail.

The door opens and Lisa comes in wearing an Itchy and 
Scratchy T-shirt and clutching an Itchy & Scratchy Movie 
souvenir progran.

How was it? 
LISA 
It wasn’t that great. 
BART 


Be honest.

9F03 TABLE DRAFT 4/1/92 


LISA 
(EXUBERANT) It was the greatest movie 
I’ve ever seen in my life. Three- 
and-a-half hours of pure joy. And 
you wouldn’t believe the celebrities 
who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, 
Michael Jackson...of course they 
didn’t use their real names, but you 
could tell it was then. 

BART 
(PAINED) Lisa. 

Bart looks unbelievably miserable. 

LISA 
Sorry Bart. 

BART 
Don’t feel sorry for me. I’ve been 
entertaining myself (LAYS ON BACK,

there are 324 dots in each acoustical 
tile? Except that one. It has 322. 

Lisa looks at Bart with real pity.

MARGE 
No. 

LISA 
You’ve got to let Bart see that 
movie, Dad. I’ve never seen him like 
this. He has the demented 
melancholia of a Tennessee Williams 
heroine. 

HOMER 
Don’t you think I know that? 

MARGE 
It’s been two months. I think he’s 
learned his lesson. 

HOMER 
I’m not trying to hurt the boy. But 
he’s at a crossroads right now. If I 
hold firm he could wind up Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court. If I 
fail now, he could wind up as a lousy 
small town judge with just enough 
power to lock up the town drunk. I 
can’t let that happen, I won’t let 
that happen and I can’t let that 


happen.

Bart lies on his bed, holding a picture of a smiling Itchy
