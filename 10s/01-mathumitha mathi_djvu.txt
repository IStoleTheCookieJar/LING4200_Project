ABSTRACT 


Background:  Admission  of  a newborn  in  a NICU  may  be  a major  crisis  in  the  lives  of  parents  and  may  produce  greater  levels  of  stress.  This  study  was  done  with  the 
intention  of  reducing  the  parental  stress  in  NICU  and  improving  the  coping  strategies  of  the  parents. 

Methods  and  Materials : One  group  pre-test  and  post-test  was  used.  Mothers  were  taken  belongs  to  NICU  admitted  high-risk  neonates  were  target  population.  A sam- 
ple of  75  mothers  were  taken  using  quasi  experimental  design.  Stress  was  assessed  by  using  modified  parental  stressor  scale.  But  the  counselling  was  given  by  using 
assisted  video  teaching  and  flashcards. 

Results:  This  study  has  revealed  that  counselling  program  helps  to  reduce  the  stress  level  for  the  mothers  of  high-risk  neonates.  The  pre-test  mean  score  stress  level  in 
parental  role  alteration  is  2.03±0.84,  but  in  post-  test  it  is  reduced  to  1 .61+0.55.  The  Neonatal  Intensive  Care  Unit  mothers  of  high  risk  neonates  needed  good  communi- 
cation with  physician,  nurses  and  other  health  workers  helps  to  reduce  the  stress  level  in  NICU. 

KEYWORDS:  stress,  coping, NICU,  mothers. 


Introduction: 

Stress  is  a common  disorder  occurs  in  everyone's  life  worldwide.  Stress  affects 
the  mind  and  the  body.  It  not  only  affects  thoughts  and  feelings  but  also  affects 
the  body  in  ways  you  can  feel  (increased  heart  rate).  In  this  study  the  mothers  of 
high  risk  neonates,  stress  also  can  affect  their  ability  to  breast  feed  their  infant. 
Colman  (2003)  defined  stress  as  psychological  and  physical  strain  or  tension 
generated  by  physical,  emotional,  social,  economical  or  occupational  circum- 
stances that  are  difficult  to  manage  or  endure.  Turan,  et  al  (2008)  revealed  that 
parents  of  children  in  the  NICU  experience  high  levels  of  stress  and  that  there  are 
interventions  which  can  decrease  the  stress  level  of  the  parents.  The  parental 
stressor  scale  was  used  as  the  primary  measurement  tool  in  this  study  .Informa- 
tion obtained  from  the  PSS  demonstrates  that  the  stress  reducing  nursing  inter- 
ventions were  the  primary  cause  for  the  lower  stress  levels  in  the  intervention 
groups.  Datta  (2009)  explained  that  hospitalization  of  a child  is  the  break  in  the 
unity  of  the  family.  Emotional  reactions  of  each  member  of  the  family  must  be 
considered  to  help  them  to  adjust  with  stress  due  to  the  hospital  situation  and  ill- 
ness. Parents  whose  child  has  been  admitted  to  the  hospital  feel  not  only  separa- 
tion from  their  children  but  also  they  may  have  feeling  of  inadequacy  as  others 
provide  care  for  other  children.  They  feel  anxiety,  anger,  fear,  disappointment, 
self-  blame  and  possible  guilty  feeling  due  to  lack  of  confidence  and  competence 
for  caring  the  child  in  illness  and  wellness.  According  to  Yee  et  al  (2006)  states 
that  good  communication  between  parents  and  staff  is  needed  for  the  likely  out- 
come of  high  risk  neonates  and  also  discussed  the  best  practices  for  the  health  pro- 
fessionals communicating  with  the  parents  of  high  risk  neonates. 

Objective: 

To  correlate  the  parental  role  alteration  and  stress  in  mothers  of  high-risk  neo- 
nates. 

Assumptions: 

1 . Mothers  of  high  risk  neonates  admitted  in  NICU  experience  anxiety,  tension 
fatigue  and  insomnia  etc., 

2.  Mothers  of  high  risk  neonates  stress  varies  according  to  the  diagnosis  and 
treatment  of  the  pre-term  neonates  etc. 

De-limitations: 

1 . The  study  was  limited  to  mothers  of  high  risk  neonates  admitted  in  Neonatal 
Intensive  Care  Unit  at  RMMCH,  Annamalai  Nagar  Chidambaram. 

2 . The  sample  size  was  limited  to  75  mothers  of  high-risk  neonates  admitted  in 
NICU. 

3 . The  period  of  study  was  only  six  months. 


Material  and  method: 

The  study  was  carried  out  in  NICU  of  selected  hospital  in  Tamil  Nadu  . One 
group  pre-test  and  post-test  was  used  .A  total  of  75  mothers  were  selected  and 
non-probability  purposive  sampling  technique  was  used.  In  this  study,  the  target 
population  consisted  of  mothers  of  high-risk  neonates  admitted  in  NICU.  The 
study  was  done  for  6 months.  The  purpose  of  the  study  was  explained  to  every 
respondent  so  as  to  get  their  full  co-operation  and  consent  was  obtained  from 
them.  Privacy  was  given,  stress  and  coping  level  was  assessed  by  using  the  PSS 
(Parental  stressor  scale)  on  the  2nd  day  of  admission  and  the  same  day  evening 
counselling  program  was  given  by  using  the  video  assisted  teaching  and  flash- 
cards. This  procedure  is  repeated  for  4th  and  7th  day  as  post-test  (1  & 2).  Then  the 
overall  pre-test  stress  level  and  post-test  stress  level  were  compared. 

Raines  (2013)  conducted  a descriptive  study  to  determine  the  occurrence  of 
stress  and  the  areas  of  stress  experienced  by  mothers  in  NICU  to  the  home  set- 
ting. The  author  used  PSS  and  infant  hospitalization  tool  and  a global  measure  of 
stress  .The  results  revealed  that  the  highest  area  of  stress  was  parental  role  alter- 
ation with  extremely  high  levels  of  stress  reported  by  34%  of  participants. 

Rosenthal,  Schmid  et  al  (2007)  conducted  a study  and  evaluated  the  stress  and 
coping  of  NICU  nurses.  Questionnaires  were  designed  to  measure  the  coping 
strategies  used  by  the  nurses  (N=  30);  the  perceived  helpfulness  of  the  coping 
strategies;  the  frequency,  controllability,  and  stressfulness  of  eight  common 
NICU  situations;  and  overall  stress  and  satisfaction.  The  results  revealed  that 
nurses  used  a variety  of  problem-oriented  and  emotion-oriented  coping  strate- 
gies. 

Data  analysis  and  results 

The  data  collected  were  coded.  Descriptive  mean  and  standard  deviation  and 
inferential  statistics  were  used  for  data  analysis. 

Table  2 depicts  the  fact  that  estimation  of  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  paren- 
tal role  alteration  stress  level  in  mothers  of  high  risk  neonates  before  and  after 
counselling  programme.  Before  the  counselling  the  mean  stress  level 
was2. 94=0. 97.  After  the  counselling  program  on  7th  day  the  mean  stress  level  was 
1.61+0.55.  The  p-value  is  highly  significant  (<0 .001). 

The  improvement  was  verified  by  the  comparison  of  mean  and  standard  devia- 
tion of  parental  role  alteration  stress  level  before  and  after  counselling  program.

Discussion: 

The  present  study  findings  revealed  that  the  parental  role  alteration  stress  level  is 
very  high  in  the  pre-test  after  the  counselling  program  the  mean  score  stress  level 
has  been  reduced  from  2.94  + 0.97  to  1.61+  0.55.  It  shows  the  counselling  pro- 
gram is  more  effective  in  reducing  the  stress  level  of  mothers  of  high  risk  Neo- 
nates in  Intensive  Care  Unit. 

A study  conducted  by  Varghese  (20 1 5)  to  determine  the  level  of  stress  among  par- 
ents of  neonates  admitted  in  NICU  in  Northern  India.  This  study  was  conducted 
from  November  2009  to  April  2011  and  all  parents  of  neonates  admitted  in  NICU 
at  least  48  hours  were  administered  the  PSS.  Relevant  parental  and  neonatal 
demographic  data  were  collected.  The  results  revealed  that  a total  of  343  parents 
the  total  mean  score  ranged  from  1.35  to  4.91  (mean:  3.71).  The  mean  score  for 
mothers  was  3.78  and  the  mean  score  for  fathers  was  3.65.  The  mean  sub  scores 
were  high  in  infant  behaviour  (mean:  4.25)  followed  by  parental  role  alteration 
(mean:  3.64).  The  mothers  scored  higher  than  the  fathers  in  all  sub  scores  .Birth 
weight  and  gestational  age  will  influenced  the  stress  level  to  significant  degree. 
Parents  of  neonates  admitted  in  the  NICU  experience  high  levels  of  stress. 

Conclusion: 

NICU  mothers  needed  a good  communication  with  nurses,  physicians  and  other 
health  team  members.  These  measures  helps  to  reduce  the  stress  and  they  will  get 
discharge  soon  after  their  new-boms  treatment.
