This  paper  presents  an  extension  work  on  the  application  of  interconnection 
and  damping  assignment  passivity-based  controller  (IDA-PBC)  from  the 
conventional  H-bridge  inverter  to  a  5 -level  Cascaded  H-bridge  Multilevel 
Inverter  (CHMI).  With  the  controller,  the  inductor  current  and  the  voltage 
capacitor  track  the  desired  reference  of  the  inverter  to  ensure  that  the  output 
voltage  maintains  its  regulation  while  the  Total  Harmonic  Distortion  (THD) 
is  kept  at  low  levels  with  fast  transient  response.  It  is  designed  based  on  the 
Port-Control  Hamiltonian  theory  exploiting  the  dissipation  properties  of  the 
averaged  model  of  inverter  circuits.  The  results  obtained  have  proven  that 
the  IDA-PBC  previously  developed  for  the  H-bridge  inverter  can  be  easily 
extended  and  applied  to  the  CHMI  circuit.  The  simulation  results  showed 
that  the  IDA-PBC  is  able  to  maintain  the  output  voltage  regulation  in  both 
circuits  in  the  case  of  no-load  to  full-load  condition,  load  uncertainty, 
and  structural  uncertainty  while  maintaining  THD  of  less  than  5%.  However, 
in  all  cases,  CHMI  has  shown  better  performance  in  terms  of  THD 
percentage  and  transient  response  compared  to  the  H-bridge  inverter,  which 
are  290  ps  and  150  ps  respectively.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Inverters  are  the  simplest  technology  to  convert  DC  to  AC  power  and  have  been  integrated  in  many 
applications,  including  uninterruptible  power  supplies  (UPS),  induction  heating,  high-voltage  direct  current 
(HVDC)  transmission,  electric  vehicles,  and  various  renewable  energy  applications  [1],[2].  Inverters  have 
gone  through  many  technological  improvements  which  include  their  capabilities  in  handling  high  power 
systems  and  reduction  in  switching  losses.  One  of  the  improvement  methods  is  by  increasing  the  output 
voltage  levels  of  the  inverters  that  in  turn  reduce  the  Total  Harmonic  Distortion  (THD)  while  also  reducing 
the  voltage  stress  on  each  component  [3], [4].  The  multilevel  inverter  topology,  which  was  first  introduced  in 
1975  [5],  became  popular  over  the  years  due  to  the  fact  that  it  was  able  to  provide  less  disturbances  and 
offered  the  possibility  to  function  at  lower  switching  frequencies  compared  to  the  ordinary  three-level 
H-bridge  inverters  [6].  Various  types  of  controllers  such  as  hysteresis  [7],  sliding  mode  [8]  and  fuzzy  logic 
[9]  have  been  proposed  for  multilevel  inverters  over  the  years,  mainly  to  maintain  output  voltage  regulation 
and  good  dynamic  performance.  In  recent  years,  there  is  an  emerging  interest  on  the  development  of  a 
controller  based  on  the  concept  of  passivity  that  exploits  the  total  energy  of  the  system  [10],[11].  There  are 
two  types  of  the  so-called  passivity-based  controller  (PBC)  i.e  the  classical  PBC  and  the  interconnection  and 
damping  assignment  PBC  (IDA-PBC).  The  work  presented  in  [12]  shows  that  the  performance  of  the  IDA-

PBC  on  a  single-phase  H-bridge  inverter  is  better  than  that  of  the  classical  PBC.  The  former  has  managed  to 
maintain  the  inverter  output  voltage  regulation  with  fast  time  response  and  low  THD  under  load  and 
parameters  uncertainties.  This  paper  extends  the  work  presented  in  [12]  for  a  5-level  Cascaded  H-bridge 
Multilevel  Inverter  (CHMI).  The  performance  of  both  the  conventional  H-bridge  inverter  and  CHMI  under 
IDA-PBC  control  are  compared  and  analyzed. 


2.  INTERCONNECTION  AND  DAMPING  ASSIGNMENT  PASSIVITY-BASED  CONTROLLER 
(IDA-PBC) 

The  IDA-PBC,  introduced  by  Ortega  et  al.  [13],  is  a  physically-inspired  control  design  methodology 
that  invokes  the  principles  of  energy -shaping  and  dissipation  and  formulated  for  systems  described  by  the 
Port-Controlled  Hamiltonian  (PCH)  models.  The  main  objective  of  this  method  is  to  stabilize  the  dynamical 
system  by  rendering  the  closed-loop  system  passive  (by  shaping  its  energy)  with  a  desired  storage  function 
(which  is  a  proper  Lyapunov  function)  [11].  Apart  from  that,  the  system  can  be  asymptotically  stabilized  if  it 
can  be  rendered  strictly  (output)  passive  by  means  of  damping  injection  [14].  This  type  of  controller  has  been 
applied  in  many  power  electronic  devices  and  shows  remarkable  results  in  controlling  the  respective  system 
[12],[15] — [21]. 

In  this  paper,  the  IDA-PBC  algorithm  previously  developed  for  a  single-phase  H-bridge  inverter  in 
[12]  is  used  as  a  basis  to  develop  the  control  algorithm  of  similar  concept  for  a  5 -level  CHMI.  The  CHMI 
with  five  output  voltage  levels  has  been  selected  in  this  work  because  it  owns  the  trade-offs  of  the  advantages 
and  disadvantages  between  the  traditional  H-bridge  inverter  and  a  higher  output  voltage  level  CHMI,  i.e. 
seven,  nine,  eleven  etc.  In  comparison  to  the  H-bridge  inverter,  a  5-level  CHMI  can  generate  a  higher  output 
voltage  magnitude  by  dividing  the  voltage  between  two  H-bridges  which  results  in  reduced  voltage  stress  in 
the  circuit  components.  This  results  in  a  lower  power  losses  and  reduced  harmonic  contents  in  the  output 
voltage.  While  higher  output  voltage  levels  of  a  CHMI  may  offer  lower  output  voltage  THD  without  the  need 
for  a  filter  circuit,  the  5 -level  CHMI  can  produce  a  similar  low  output  voltage  THD  with  an  added  filter 
circuit,  but  at  a  lower  cost,  as  it  uses  less  number  of  components  and  switches  [22] . 

The  block  diagram  of  an  inverter  with  its  controller  is  shown  in  Figure  1 .  It  shows  that  the  inverter 
output  voltage  is  controlled  using  IDA-PBC.  This  is  possible  by  feeding  back  the  inductor  current,  iL  and  the 
capacitor  voltage,  vc  from  the  low-pass  LC  filter  into  the  controller.  The  IDA-PBC  uses  a  d-q  transformation 
technique  and  produces  a  sinusoidal  reference  signal,  u.  This  signal  is  compared  with  a  carrier  signal  and 
produces  the  PWM  signals  to  accordingly  turn  on  and  turn  off  the  inverter  IGBTs  as  the  switching  devices. 
Detailed  derivation  of  the  controller  algorithm  is  explained  in  the  next  section.

3.  AVERAGE  MODELING  OF  THE  5-LEVEL  CHMI 

Figure  2  shows  a  5 -level  CHMI  circuit  with  a  resistive  load  that  is  connected  to  an  LC  filter.  Each 
H-bridge  is  connected  to  a  separate  DC  voltage  source  that  is  used  to  generate  the  AC  output  voltage 
waveform.  In  general,  the  power  circuit  produces  a  5  -level  output  voltage  waveform,  including  zero  voltage 
as  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  mathematical  model  of  the  CHMI  is  developed  through  an  average  modeling 
method  as  explained  in  [23],  where  each  DC  source  is  represented  by  a  reduced  cell  denoted  as  suq  ■  Vdc

and  sw2  ■  Vdc  respectively.  The  simplified  average  circuit  of  the  5-level  CHMI  is  shown  in  Figure  4.  Each  of 
the  new,  reduced  cells  can  produce  a  3 -level  output  voltage  waveform  consisting  of  +Vdc,  - Vdc ,  and  0.  These 
voltages  can  also  be  represented  by  the  swt  switching  function  as  +1,  -1,  and  0.  The  combination  of  both 
reduced  cells  can  synthesize  a  5 -level  output  voltage  waveform,  represented  by  the  swt  switching  function  as 
-2,  -1,  0,  +1,  and  +2.

Equations  (1)  and  (2)  showed  that  the  system  is  operating  in  discontinuous  mode.  Considering  that 
each  DC  bus  feeds  the  same  voltage  to  each  cell,  and  that  each  control  signal,  u  is  assigned  to  each  cell  and  is 
denoted  as  i^and  u2,  with  u  =  {0, 1},  the  equation  (1)  can  be  represented  as: 

L^  =  u-Vdc-vc  (3)

In  this  rearranged  equation  (3),  the  control  signal  is  represented  by  u,  where  the  discrete  set 
u  =  [—2,  —1,  0,  +1,  +2}  represents  u,  which  defines  the  5-level  output  voltage  of  the  CHMI.  This  averaging 
derivation  technique  for  the  CHMI  has  been  proposed  and  discussed  in  [23], [24]. 


4.  THE  PROPOSED  CONTROLLER 

Through  the  averaging  technique,  the  control  signal  for  a  5 -level  CHMI  is  extended  to  the  discrete 
set  of  u  =  {—2,  —1, 0,  +1,  +2}.  This  averaging  method  can  also  be  extended  to  a  higher  output  voltage  level 
multilevel  inverter;  given  that  the  equation  (2)  and  (3)  are  represented  as: 

Lft=  -x2+UVdc  (4) 

C-  =  x1--x2  (5) 

dt  1  R  z  v  ' 

where  xt  and  x2  are  the  average  states  corresponding  to  iL  and  vc  respectively,  while  u  is  a  continuous  signal 
that  belongs  to  the  continuous  set  (-2,  2)  or  more.  For  the  multilevel  inverter  model,  equations  (4)  and  (5)  are 
constrained  by  the  control  law  u  =  u(xlf  x2)  such  that: 

lim^oo  x1  -  xld  =  0  ;  limx^00  x2  -  x2d  =  0  (6) 

forcing  internal  stability  and  with  prescribed  behaviors  for  the  average  state  of  the  system  [25]. 


4.1.  Port-Controlled  Hamiltonian  (PCH)  System  Details 

In  order  to  derive  the  IDA-PBC  control  algorithm,  the  Port  Controlled  Hamiltonian  (PCH) 
description  of  the  system  is  considered  [25]: 


x  =  [/(*)  -  R(x)]  —  (x)  +  g(x)u, 

y  =  00, 


(7) 


where  /(x)  and  R(x)  are  the  interconnection  structure  and  damping  assignment  respectively;  x  E  Rn  is  the 
state  variables  vector;  u  E  Rn  is  the  input  vector,  and  y  E  Rn is  the  output  vector,  u  and  y  are  the  power 
variables,  which  in  this  case,  are  the  inductor  currents,  iL  and  capacitor  voltages,  vc.  H(x)  is  the  energy 
(Hamiltonian)  function.  The  /(x)  =  — /r(x)  represents  the  interconnection  structure,  while  R(pc)  =  RT (x )  > 
0  is  the  dissipation  matrix  due  to  resistances  and  frictions. 

With  the  aim  to  represent  the  transformed  model  in  PCH  form,  and  applying  the  d-q  transformation 
for  the  equivalent  single-phase  circuit,  the  state  variables  can  be  taken  as  iLd,  iLq,  vcd  and  vcq.  The  energy 
function  is  given  as: 


H(iL,  vc)  =  \liLd2  +\iiLq2  +  1-CLvcd2  +  \Lvc2 


The  d-q  model  is  developed  as  follows:

In  order  to  design  the  controller,  these  two  important  properties  were  taken  into  consideration: 
i)  Property  1 :  For  the  equilibria  of  equation  (9)  in  the  d-q  frame,  the  desired  capacitor  voltage  signal  (a  pure 
harmonic  free  sinusoidal  signal  with  a  fixed  angular  frequency  and  amplitude)  is  considered.

ii)  Property  2:  It  is  possible  to  formulate  the  control  problem  as  follows,  since  the  complete  system  is 
measurable. 

a.  A  control  law  is  designed  such  that  the  voltage  regulation  is  maintained  under  different  load 
conditions,  while  maintaining  a  low  THD  value. 

The  energy  equation  for  the  5 -level  CHMI  can  be  defined  as  [12]: 


H d 


■Mkd  ~  kd*)2  +~L(iLq  ~  kq*)2+~C(vCd  -  vcdt)2  +  ~C(vCq)2 


(ID 


where  [kd*  kq*  vcd*  vcq*]T  =  coCVP  VP  o|  are  the  equilibrium  points. 

According  to  [25],  it  is  necessary  to  assign  the  interconnection  and  damping  matrices  in  order  to 
transform  the  PCH  model  in  equation  (9)  to  the  form, 


X  =  Ud(x)  -  Rd(x)]^(x) 


(12) 


where  Jd (x)  =  —Jd  (x)  and  Rd(x)  =  Rd  >  0.  The  derivative  of  Hd(x)  can  be  expressed  as: 


Hd(x)=  0 

aK  J  dx  av  J  dx 


(13) 


By  considering  the  following  properties, 
i)  (Integrability)  K(x)  is  the  gradient  of  a  scalar  function: 


dK 

dx 


(x)  = 


dK 

dx 


(.x) 


ii)  (Equilibrium  Assignment)  K (x)  at  x*,  verifies: 

dH 

K(x*)  =  -  —  (xj 
dx 

iii)  (Lyapunov  stability)  The  Jacobian  of  K(x),  at  x*,  satisfies  the  bound: 

dK  d2H 

-z-  M  >  ~  (x*) 

dx  dxz 

Thus,  the  vector  function  K(x)  satisfies  the  following  equation: 

[/(*)  +Ja(x)  -  (R(x)  +  /?a(x))]/<r(x)  =  ~[/a(x)  -  Ra(x)]^(x)  +  g{x)p{x)  (14) 


Under  these  conditions,  the  closed-loop  system  u  =  /?  (x)  will  be  a  port-controlled  Hamiltonian  system  as  in 
equation  (12).  The  functions  /a(x)  and  Ra(x )  are  given  as: 


Ja (X)  =  0,  Ra(x)  =

The  control-law  equations  based  on  the  PCH  IDA-PB  controller  is  obtained  in  terms  of  d-q  rotation,  which 
is  [12]:

where  lLd  =  iLd  -  iLd *  and  lLq  =  iLq  -  iLqt. 


Finally,  the  control  signal  is  given  by 

U  =  ud  +  uq  (17) 

Comparing  the  control  equation  for  the  5 -level  CHMI  with  a  single-phase  H-bridge  inverter  as  in  [12],  the 
final  control  signal  is  rather  similar,  except  for  the  fact  that  through  average  modeling  of  the  CHMI 
previously  explained  in  Section  2,  the  control  signal  for  the  5 -level  CHMI  is  represented  as, 


u  =  {-2,-l,0,+l,+2}  (18) 

Instead  of  the  three-level  square  wave  voltage  in  a  single  H-bridge.  This  proves  that  the  control 
equation  in  [12],  can  be  easily  extended  to  cater  for  CHMIs  of  higher  output  voltage  levels  and  thus  produces 
higher  output  voltage  with  reduced  THD.  The  following  sections  present  the  implementation  of  the  IDA-PBC 
control  signal  for  the  5 -level  CHMI  through  simulation  with  a  performance  comparison  study  based  on  a 
single-phase  H-bridge  inverter. 


5.  SIMULATION  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION 

Both  systems  have  been  simulated  using  MATLAB/Simulink  for  validation  purposes. 
The  parameters  used  in  the  simulation  are  as  shown  in  Table  1.  The  switching  devices  are  IGBT  modules 
commutated  at  a  frequency  of  20  kHz  using  the  phase -shift  PWM  method  for  the  CHMI  circuit.  The 
controllers  are  implemented  at  a  sample  time  of  2  ps.  In  order  to  attenuate  the  high  frequency  ripple 
associated  with  the  PWM  pattern,  a  low-pass  LC  filter  is  connected  at  the  output  of  the  inverter.  The  L  and  C 
values  have  been  calculated  using  the  Butterworth  filter  equation  and  resulted  in  a  2.813  pF  capacitor  and  a 
0.5  mH  inductor;  given  that  the  resistor  value  is  marked  at  50  Q.  The  desired  AC  output  voltage  for  both 
circuits  is  1 80  Vpeak-  Hence,  the  DC  voltage  source  of  the  H-bridge  circuit  is  200  V,  while  the  voltage  source 
of  the  CHMI  is  100  V  for  each  H-bridge.

5.1.  No  Load  to  Full  Load  Condition 

The  first  simulation  is  conducted  to  observe  the  dynamic  transient  response  based  on  the  IDA-PBC 
control  algorithm  for  both  inverters,  taking  into  consideration  the  worst -case  condition  where  a  change  of 
load  is  imposed  at  the  negative  peak  of  the  reference  output  voltage.  Initially,  the  inverter  is  operated  at  a 
no-load  condition.  Then,  at  0.055  s,  the  resistor  nominal  value  of  50  Q  is  connected  to  provide  hill-load 
operation.  Figures  5(a)  and  (b)  show  the  output  voltage  waveform  of  the  H-bridge  inverter  and  the  5 -level 
CHMI.  It  is  noticed  that  in  both  circuits,  output  voltage  regulation  is  achieved  with  low  THD.  Figure  6  shows 
the  comparison  made  on  the  output  voltage  waveforms  of  both  inverters  with  respect  to  reference  during  the 
load  transition.  It  can  be  seen  in  Figure  6(a)  that  the  ripples  in  the  CHMI  output  voltage  during  unloading 
condition  is  smaller  than  that  of  the  H-bridge  inverter.  This  is  reflected  by  the  fact  that  the  output  voltage 
THD  of  the  former  is  lower  than  that  of  the  latter,  which  are  1.07%  and  3.05%  respectively.  Figure  6(b) 
shows  the  transient  times  of  the  circuits.  The  transient  time  for  the  H-bridge  inverter,  tj  is  measured  at  180  {is 
which  is  slightly  longer  than  the  transient  time  for  the  CHMI,  t2  that  is  measured  at  160  ps.

5.2.  Load  Uncertainty 

The  simulation  is  then  conducted  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of  the  controller  with  respect  to  the 
uncertainty  in  the  load  resistance  value.  A  100%  instantaneous  step  change  in  the  load  resistance  is  applied 
by  changing  the  resistance  from  100  Q  to  50  Q  and  vice-versa.  The  system  response  under  load  transition  for 
the  H-bridge  inverter  and  the  5 -level  CHMI  are  shown  in  Figures  7(a)  and  (b)  respectively.  It  is  noticed  that 
as  the  load  resistance  is  reduced,  the  load  and  inductor  current  increase  with  time  while  maintaining  its 
stability  and  high  performance,  and  most  importantly,  the  output  voltage  regulation  is  maintained. 
Comparison  of  the  output  voltage  waveforms  of  the  H-bridge  inverter  and  the  CHMI  with  the  reference 
voltage  waveform  is  shown  in  Figure  8.  In  Figure  8  (a),  it  is  noticeable  that  the  output  voltage  of  the  H-bridge 
inverter  produces  more  significant  ripples  compared  to  CHMI’s.  This  leads  to  higher  output  voltage  THD  for 
the  H-bridge  inverter  which  is  4.19  %  and  lower  output  voltage  THD  for  the  CHMI  which  is  1.59  %.  Figure 
8(b)  shows  the  settling  time  of  the  inverter  circuits  during  load  change.  The  settling  time  for  the  H-bridge 
inverter,  denoted  as  ^  is  measured  at  185  {is  while  the  settling  time  for  the  CHMI,  t2  is  measured  at  170  fis.

5.3.  Structural  Uncertainty  Test  -  Nonlinear  Load 

The  final  simulation  study  included  in  this  paper  is  also  related  to  the  uncertainty  on  the  load; 
specifically,  the  structural  uncertainty.  In  this  case,  a  nonlinear  load  consisting  of  a  single -phase  full-bridge 
rectifier  circuit  with  a  capacitor  and  a  resistor  is  connected  in  parallel  to  the  inverter  circuits.  The  resistance  is 
chosen  as  50  Q  whereas  the  capacitance  is  set  at  350  pF.  The  system  response  for  both  the  H-bridge  inverter 
and  the  5 -level  CHMI  is  shown  in  Figures  9(a)  and  (b)  respectively.  The  inductor  and  load  currents  are  both 
distorted,  as  expected.  However,  output  voltage  regulation  is  remarkably  achieved,  even  in  the  presence  of 
the  nonlinear  load.  The  H-bridge  inverter  gives  an  output  voltage  THD  of  3.94%,  while  a  lower  output 
voltage  THD  of  1.62%  is  obtained  by  the  5-level  CHMI.  Table  2  provides  the  summary  of  results  obtained 
from  the  simulation  study.

6.  CONCLUSION 

The  IDA-PBC  control  algorithm  previously  applied  to  an  H-bridge  inverter  in  [12]  can  be  extended 
for  application  in  a  5-level  CHMI,  as  detailed  in  Section  4.  The  newly  derived  control  algorithm  for  the  latter 
is  validated  through  a  series  of  simulation  under  various  loading  conditions.  The  controller  has  managed  to 
achieve  its  objective  in  maintaining  output  voltage  regulation  while  ensuring  low  THD  in  both  types  of 
inverters.  However,  the  results  obtained  for  the  5 -level  CHMI  have  shown  a  remarkably  faster  time  response 
and  a  lower  output  voltage  THD  during  all  loading  conditions  compared  to  those  of  the  H-bridge  inverter. 
This  is  as  expected  due  to  the  advantages  offered  by  the  multilevel  inverter  topology  itself.  For  future  work, 
new  interconnections  and  damping  matrices  functions  can  be  proposed  to  tune  the  controller  for  a  much 
better  output  performance.
