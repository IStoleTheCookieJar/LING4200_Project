Introduction 


Three million years of creativity and curiosity have produced 


tens of thousands of inventions and discoveries. Those that 


successfully met basic human needs — from the need to survive to 


the need to know — have played a big part in shaping our world. 


ur world is very 
different from the 
world of our ancestors. 
Tens of thousands of 
inventions and 
discoveries have 
transformed the way we do things and the 
way we think. An invention is something 
new, created by arranging things in some 


novel way. A discovery is a thing or

principle that already existed, needing only 
to be found. But it is often difficult to tell 


| where invention ends and discovery 


begins. Whatever they are, few inventions 
or discoveries are made overnight. There is 
usually a period of preparation before they 
emerge. Even then, they take time to act. 
An inyention may take years to displace 
existing methods. A discovery may take 
generations to change habits of thought. 


WHEN DID IT HAPPEN? 

This is not a book of “firsts”. I have listed 
most inventions and discoveries under the 
date when they were first made public. 
But some dates relate to the beginning of 


| something that only later became well 
| known, or to a later stage of something 


that took time to influence people. It can 
also be difficult to say exactly who 
invented or discovered something. Often, 
when the time is right, many people come 
up with the same idea. And making an 
idea work can be more important than 
simply thinking of it. At the top of each 
invention or discovery, I have named the 
people who I think contributed most to it.

inventing or discovering can 

be, and how it can change 
people's lives. Other aspects of 
these lives appear at the foot of 
most pages in a timeline, which 
records events in the wider world. 


FASTER AND FASTER 

Over the centuries, inventions and 
discoveries followed two main trends. 
Ancient ideas became modern science as 
measurement and mathematics improved 
on observation and argument, and the way 
things were made changed radically as 
scientific techniques displaced traditional 
crafts. These trends continue at an ever 
greater rate today. You may notice that while 
the first section of the book covers nearly 
three million years, the last covers only fifty. 
Despite this rapid change, many inventions

and discoveries have had a lasting effect. 
Some, such as windmills or the theory of 
continental drift, vanished for a while but 
were born again. Others, such as pottery, 
have never been replaced. Inventions and 
discoveries like these were used or 
remembered because they met basic human 
needs. Until recently, these needs have not 
changed. But we may soon know enough to 
control the machinery of life itself, changing 
our basic needs and making the future less 
certain. I hope that this book will help you 
to understand how we got where we are 
now, and maybe even help you to guess 


where we are going next.

LEARNING THE 


BASICS 


BY MAKING TOOLS that either 
change their environment or 
help them to cope with it, 
human beings can survive 
where other animals cannot. 
It took hundreds of thousands 
of years for people to make 
the basic inventions and 
discoveries that underpin 
what we now call technology. 


_ Stone tools Use of fire

ourselves and most other of fire long before they 
animals is that we use tools found out how to make it

They used fire for 
warmth and to cook 
food. Better still, fire 
could be used to clear 
away bushes and trees 
so that the grass grew 


HAND AXE 

The best stone for 
tools was flint. 
This flint hand

1000-5000 zc, 
was found in

France animals for people to 


catch and eat 


If flakes are 
chipped off, flint 
naturally forms

Mining 


arly people 
made full use of 
thing around them, 
| including rocks, which 
they used to make tools and to 
extract minerals. After a time, 
the good rocks on the surface 
were all used up, and people 
had to start digging to find 
| what they wanted. The first 
mines were just shallow pits, 
but miners were eventually 
forced underground. One of 
the minerals they wanted was 
red ochre, which was used as a 
pigment for ritual purposes 
and for cave paintings. The 
oldest known underground 
mine was used for collecting 
red ochre. It is at Bomvu Ridge 
in Swaziland, Africa 


Hand axe 


os a period of more than 


one million years, the first 
crude stone tools evolved into 
beautifully shaped blades 
Their makers flaked away the 
surfaces of a large flint pebble 
until its sides were sharp, for 
cutting or scraping, and one 
end was pointed, for piercing

same way as the

_ Engraving tool 


| Ae long as 40,000 years ago, 

| people were making 
delicate objects and works of 
art using stone engraving tools 


called burins. Made by forming 


a sharp edge on a flake of flint, 
a burin could be used to 
ratch lines and cut grooves 


in bone or wood. This 

allowed people to create 

more precise tools, such 
as needles, and to 
engrave decoration on 
larger objects. 


Fish hook 


he earliest method of 
catching a fish was with a 
piece of stone, pointed at both 
ends, baited, and tied to a line 
This gorge, as it is called, 
simply jammed in the fish’s 
throat. The first real fish hooks 
were developed by the earliest 


+ “modern” humans, the Cro- 
| Magnons. They caught their 


fish using a barbed bone hook, 
one of the many small, 
specialized tools they made 
using the versatile burin that 
they had perfected. 


Handles 
for tools 


aNeganshy a wooden handle 
to a blade may not sound 
like a breakthrough, but it 
was. People could not hit 
things very hard with a tool 
held in their hands because 
it hurt. Nor could they 
swing the tool very quickly 

§ because their arms were too 
short. A handle, or haft, 

| helped them to overcome 
both these limitations, 
protecting their arms from 


House After 20,000 
| years of development, 
| houses began to be 

made of brick. This

which is exposed by the low 
sea level. The bridge will later 


| hunters needed was a way of 


impact and increasing the 
length of their swing. Hand | 
axes (% see page 7) could be 
used to clear away bushes, but 
axes with hafts could be used 
to chop down trees. 


Spear thrower 


B creeping along quietly, 
early hunters could often 
get close enough to an animal 
to throw a spear at it and kill it. 
But sometimes the animal 
would run away. What the 


throwing spears from farther 
away. The spear thrower was a 
piece of wood or antler with a 
notch at one end to hold the 

| spear. It enabled hunters to 
hurl their weapons farther and 
| increased their chances of 


killing their prey. 


Bricks are molded from 


| mud and baked in the sun 


Bow and arrow 


ows and arrows were 

depicted in cave paintings 
from 30,000 Bc onward, but 
no actual examples survive 
today. By 18,000 sc, arrows 
were equipped with flint 
points, making them deadly 
to animals. Later, the bow 
came into use as a major 
military weapon and became 
deadly to people, too 


Cave painting 


Dee paintings made by 
people living more than 
30,000 years ago lay forgotten 
until 1879, when a little girl, 


| Maria de Sautuola, visited the 


Roof structure built from 
branches and reeds 


caves at Altamira in Spain with 
her father. She noticed the huge 
paintings of animals high above 
her head. Since then, even 
earlier paintings have been 
discovered at Chauvet in 
France. The artists of these 
early paintings had to invent 
paint, brushes, scaffolding, and 
even artificial lighting before 
they could begin painting 


Paintbrush 


he artists who created the 

cave paintings at Altamira 
in Spain, Lascaux in France, 
and in other places, probably 
put colour on to the walls in 
several different ways, 
including spitting it out. Some 
of the effects they produced 
must have needed a paintbrush. 
At its simplest, this could have

may also have used bunches of 
feathers or bristles. 


Rope 


iL is difficult to say exactly 
when people first started to 
make rope because few early 
examples have survived, except 
in bogs, where the acid water 
has stopped it from rotting. But 
some early drawings and 
sculptures show it in use. It has 


| also sometimes been preserved 


as an impression In clay, as in 


the caves of Lascaux, where 


archaeologists found evidence 


| of a rope braided from three | 
| plant fibres. One early use of 


rope was for making nets and 
snares for catching food.

House 


eople started to build 

houses about 30,000 years 
ago, but most people lived in 
shelters or caves. They also 
built simple huts, in which 
they probably lived for some 
time before moving on to find 
food. At Dolni Vestonice in the 
Czech Republic, archaeologi 
have found the remains of 
houses built from stone, wood, 
and mammoth bones, dating 
from about 25,000 8c

known boomerang was found 
in a cave in southern Poland, 
and it is probably about 
21,000 years old. The 
Australian boomerang was in 
use by 8000 Bc 


Pottery 


Hz harnessed the power 
of fire, people were able to 
make pottery. The first potters 
only needed to find some soft 
clay, shape it, and then heat it 
in a fire. Because an ordinary 
fire did not heat the clay very 
evenly, the resulting pots were 
fragile and not completely 
waterproof, but they still 
proved extremely useful

years ago has been

engraved designs. They also 
create images in color. For red, 
they use a rock called red ochre, 
or sometimes human blood. 


LEARNING BASICS 


Cutting holes 
in the skull 


THE 


Pe ple once thought that 
disease was caused by 
demons getting inside a 
person’s head or gods stealing 
their soul. Their answer was to 
cut a hole in the head to let the 
demons out or the soul back 
| in. Trephining probably took 
place as early as 10,000 Bc, and 
a skull from about 5000 Bc, 
found at Ensisheim in 
| France, shows clear 
evidence of the 
operation 


Bone shows 

signs of healing, 

indicating that this 

individual survived the 
process of trephining | 


CUTTING HOLES IN

skull was trephined 


in 2200-2000 Bc 


Other skulls show that people 
survived it: bone around the 
hole has grown, proving that 
the patient lived 


Whistle

earliest musical instrument 
Archaeologists have found

examples more than 12,000 
years old. People in China were 
using whistles with more than 
one note at least 9,000 years 
ago. We don’t know exactly 
how the whistle was invented, | 
but it is likely that the first step 
was when someone blew across 
the end of a natural tube, such 
as bamboo or bone.

Oven 


he earliest method of 

cooking was to put food 
over an open fire and turn it 
occasionally. But this wasted 
uel and someone had to do the 
turning. It was more efficient to 
put the fire inside a stone or 


the oven was hot, the cook 
could rake out the fire, put the 
food in, and seal it up until the 
‘ood was ready. The first known 
ovens were found in the city of 
ericho in ancient Palestine, 
where people have been living 
or more than 10,000 years 


FLINT MINING This 
prehistoric pick is made 
from a deer’s antler. 


Flint mining 


| ae hundreds of thousands 

| of years, people made tools 
from the stones that they found 
around them. As the need for 

| tools grew, toolmakers began 
to dig for suitable stones like 

| flints. Fortunately, flints are 


found in soft chalk, which 
| miners could cut away with 
| picks made from antlers. Early 
flint miners in Britain and 
| France sank complex mining 
shafts and galleries that went 
as deep as 40 ft (13 m) 


sharply and the great ice sheet ; 
covering Europe starts to shrink, 
opening up huge areas of land 


Sheep 


bout 10,000 years ago, 
sheep lived wild in 
western Asia and around the 
Mediterranean. They are now 
found in more countries than 
any other domestic animal 
The first farmers may have 
| favoured sheep because they 
tended to follow a leader, 
which made them easy to 
herd. They were also small and 
hardy, and produced valuable 
| wool as well as meat and milk. 


Wheat and 
barley 


heat and barley are 

basically just types of 
grass. Modern varieties are the 
result of a continuous process 
of selection, which started 
when the first farmers chose 
to cultivate the plants with 
the most plentiful and largest 
seeds. The first crops were 


probably cultivated somewhere 


in the Middle East, perhaps 
near Jericho, which had a large 
population to feed. Traces of 

| wheat and barley seeds have 

| been found buried under the 

| modern town 

| 


Chisel 


bout 9,000 years ago, 
people began to grind 
stones to form a sharp edge 
instead of flaking them. This 
| meant they could use tough 
| stones to make longer-lasting 
| tools. One such tool was the 


chisel, a blade sharpened at the 
end, not the side. It gave better 
control for carving objects from

LEARNING THE BASICS ; 


GOING FOR GROWTH 


No going back as hunters become farmers 


ae time after 10,000 Bc, people made 
the first real attempt to control the 
world they lived in, through agriculture. 
Over thousands of years, they began to 
depend less on what they could hunt 
or gather from the wild, and more on 
animals they had tamed and crops they 
had sown. The abundant food that 
agriculture provided allowed small 
villages to grow into great cities. 
= It is not clear why people changed their 
Carbonized wheat, barley, fig lifestyle like this. We can only guess at what 
seeds, and grape seeds from an Z . ; 
archaeological site in Jordan inspired them to try herding sheep or 
planting wheat. Whatever the reasons, 
there was no going back. Farming produced more food per 
person than hunting and gathering, so people were able to 
raise more children. And, as more children were 
born, more food was needed. Agriculture 
gave people their first experience 
of the power of technology 
to change lives. 

Some of the first people 
to become farmers lived 
in a huge, sunny, well 
watered area in the 
Middle East called the 

Fertile Crescent (now 
Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan,

EARLY HARVEST 
The first farmers 
grew einkorn, a type 
of wheat, and other 
crops. They harvested 
the wheat with a sickle, 
made by attaching a flint blade 
to a wooden handle. The sickle 
made it easy to cut down 

the tall, strong stems.

places as far apart as China and South America. They 
may have started because people noticed that the 
grains they gathered sometimes sprouted, or that sheep 
liked to stick together and were easy to control. 

By about 6000 Bc, people had discovered that the 
best cereals to grow were wheat and barley, and that 
pigs, cows, and sheep returned the effort involved in 
rearing them by providing meat, milk, leather, and wool. 
Later, they used oxen for pulling plows. People learned to 
work with the seasons, planting at the right time and, in 
dry areas, making use of annual floods to irrigate their 
fields. They also invented granaries where the harvest could be stored. 

This style of farming lasted for another 8,000 years. Then, with the rise 
of science, changes began. New methods meant that fewer people were 
needed in farming. In the last century or so, these changes have 


accelerated. New power machinery, artificial fertilizers, and pesticides have 


now totally transformed a way of life that started in the Stone Age. 


As well as changing people’ lives, 
agriculture gradually changed the 
landscape as farmers began to plow 
fields and channel water to their crops. 


HARVESTING TODAY 
Cereals are still harvested in 
the “Fertile Crescent” today. 
The principles of harvesting 
grain have not changed over 
the centuries, but in many 
areas the farmers now use 
machines like this combine 
harvester in Syria. This huge 
machine cuts, threshes, and 
winnows the crop

for stone structures like

Se after people began to 
grow crops, they developed 
special tools for harvesting 
them. The first was a short, 
straight blade known as a 
sickle. Dating from about 
7000 bc onward, flint sickles 
were one of the inventions 
that made agriculture possible 
(% see pages 12-13). A later 
development was a curved 
blade, which could cut several 
stems at once. The curved 
sickle is still in use today in 
some places, but with a steel 
blade instead of a stone one.

enough to be used almost as it is 


TRADERS AND THEIR TRADES 


SEVERAL EARLY settlements, such as Catal Hiyuk in Turkey 
(6500-5400 Bc), and San Lorenzo in South America 
(1150-900 Bc), owed their growth to trade. Catal Htytk’s 
population grew to about 5,000 at its height because it had 
access to the valuable material obsidian. Trading was also 
important for island dwellers, who could rarely find 
everything they needed locally but were able to produce 


specialized crops such as spices. : 
Cinnamon 


OBSIDIAN 

A natural glass formed by volcanoes, obsidian could be used to make 
much sharper cutting tools than flint or other stones. People living in 
what is now Turkey had plenty of this material but lacked precious 
metals, so they traded one for the other. Obsidian from this area has 
been found in ancient Palestine, 550 miles (900 km) away. 


SPICES 

Trading in spices such as cinnamon, 
cloves, ginger, and pepper goes back

need. Trading allows people to 
exchange things they have too 
much of for things they lack, 
and probably make a profit at 
the same time. Trading became 
common when the first cities

profits from trading helped 
many cities to grow. As 
transportation improved, 
trading spread more 
widely, exposing

THE BASICS 


Bee weaving and cloth 
making were both common 
by 5000 sc. Baskets probably 
came first because weaving a 
basket was easier than weaving 
cloth. No loom was needed, 
and weavers could use whole 
plant stems instead of having to 
spin plant fibers into thread 
Baskets were made using split 
bamboo in China, flax and 
straw in the Middle East, and 
willow in Europe. People in 
these areas also used the same 
materials to weave matting.

By about 3500 Bc, potters were 
molding clay on a turntable, 
possibly made from a round 
stone, which helped them to 
shape their pots more 
uniformly. Before 
long, they were using 
a heavy stone on an

KINDS OF CALENDAR 


A CALENDAR is like a clock that tells you what 
time of year it is, instead of what time of day. All 
calendars have to allow for the fact that a year 
does not contain a whole number of days or 
lunar months. Early calendars 


tended to run fast or 
slow, because their 
year was shorter 
or longer than 
the actual 
time it 
takes 

for Earth 
to go 
around 
the Sun. 


This is

partly on a ritual cycle 
of 260 days.

they did this was by cutting

gradually evolved into writing 
numbers. At first, people wrote 
24 marks to represent the 
number 24. By about 3400 Bc,

LUNISOLAR CALENDARS 

These calendars were based on the lunar 
month, during which the Moon goes 

from new to full and back. This has no 
connection with the solar year, the time 
Earth takes to go exactly once around the 
Sun. So people using lunisolar calendars 
had to throw in an extra month every 
now and then to keep their 
months in step with the years. 


_ Sun god surrounded by the

THE EGYPTIAN 
CALENDAR 
The Egyptians 
ignored the Moon 
and used 12 
months of exactly 
30 days each, 
plus 5 days at the 
end of the year, 
which didn’t 
belong to any 
month. It was a 
simple method, but 
because this calendar 
gave a year of exactly 
365 days, one-quarter 
of a day shorter than the 
true solar year, it gained 
25 days in every 100 years.

cone cia ital: | ago in Mesopotamia, a group of people known as the Sumerians

tokens shaped like animals, jars, and other goods, and 

recorded deals by wrapping the tokens up in clay 

envelopes. Once they'd sealed an envelope, they could no 

longer see what was inside it. So, using a pointed stick, they 

marked the soft clay with signs that showed its contents. 

It didn’t take them long to realize that, once they'd done this, 
they didn’t need the tokens any more: just the marked envelope 
would do. So by about 3100 Bc, the envelopes had turned into 
simple squares of clay recording trade deals 
in symbols. Writing had begun. 

At first, the Sumerians used marks that 
were simplified pictures. To speed things up, 
they started jabbing the clay with the end of 
a reed instead of drawing with a stick. The 
pictures stopped looking like real things and 
became true writing. Archaeologists call it 
cuneiform. It was used for 3,000 years. 

There are some problems with writing in 
this way. Every time a new word is invented, 
someone has to invent a new mark. Some 


WRITING WITH A REED 

The first “pencil and paper” 
was a stiff piece of reed and 
a soft piece of clay. The 
end of the reed was 

cut and used to 
make marks in 
the clay. 


CUNEIFORM 
WRITING 
Writing in Sumeria 
speeded up as curved 
lines gradually 
developed into wedges 
or triangles with short, 
straight sides. Later, 
signs were written from 
left to right, without any 
spaces between words

The invention of writing allowed 
merchants to keep track of 
deals by recording what was 
agreed upon. Cuneiform 
writing was later used 
to set down laws made 
by the Babylonian 

king Hammurabi.

words, like “in” or “at,” are hard to turn into pictures. And 
how do people write their names? The Sumerians coped 
with this problem to some extent by using words they could 
picture to represent words they could not: “in,” for example, 
sounded like “water” in Sumerian, so they used the mark 
for water to represent “in” too. 

Today, people in China still use a similar system, but 
they developed it independently, perhaps about 3,500 years 
ago, and use completely different symbols. It has survived 
because people in different parts of China pronounce the 
same words very differently, so alphabetic writing, which

Although the Sumerians never used an alphabet, they 
were the first people to write. Without writing, there would 
be no history, and those ancient traders have certainly 
earned their place in it. 


LEARNING THE BASICS 


Ramp 


y about 3000 Bc, people 

were using the basic 
elements of machines: wheels, 
levers, and inclined planes, 
known as ramps. The inclined 
plane makes it easier to raise a 
heavy object by allowing it to 
be pushed or pulled gradually 
ip a slope, instead of lifting it 
straight up. The 2-ton stone 
blocks of Egypt's Great Pyramid 
of Giza were put into place in 
about 2500 Bc by workers 
pulling them up ramps. 


Lathe 


« 


A ex lathe, perhaps 5,000 
years old, allows its user to 
form a piece of material into a 
circular shape by spinning it 
against a cutting edge. The 
mechanism of the earliest lathes 
was like that of early drills 

(% see page 7). A cord was 
wrapped around the piece to be 
shaped and pulled back and 
forth by a bow to make it 
rotate. Marble vases turned on 
a lathe, dating from before 
2000 Bc, have been found on 
some islands in the Aegean Sea. 


he harp is one of the 

oldest musical 
instruments, It first 
appeared in Sumeria 
and Egypt about 5,000 
years ago. Early harps 
resembled bows used 
to fire arrows, but had

almost as complicated as a 
piano, it is still played in its 
simplest form in parts of Africa 
and Afghanistan. 


Lever 


Ae lever is a rod or bar 
that turns over a pivot 
point called a fulcrum. It 
changes the force exerted on 
one end into a greater force, 
but with smaller movement, at 
the other end. People were 
using levers by 3000 Bc, and 
probably long before that. They 
may have discovered that a 
rock that was impossible to lift 
directly could be levered up 
with a tree branch resting on a 
smaller stone, which acted as 
the fulcrum. It wasn’t until 
about 250 sc that Archimedes 
came up with a full explanation 
of how levers worked. 


he lyre is a musical 
instrument that is closely 
related to the harp. The strings

People were playing lyres in 
Sumeria by 2800 sc. The 
instrument remained a favorite 
with the ancient Greeks, who 
linked it to the god Apollo, a 
handsome and gifted musician. 
Unlike the harp, the lyre did 
not make it into the modern 
orchestra. 


Papyrus 


he ancient Egyptians used 

papyrus much like we use 
paper. They made it by 
squashing and drying a mat of 
reed fibres until they stuck 
together, then polishing them 
with a stone to form a smooth 
sheet. Papyrus was too stiff to 
fold, so the Egyptians joined 
the sheets together to make 
long scrolls. It was on these 
scrolls that they wrote and 
drew much of what we now 
know about ancient Egypt from 
about 2600 Bc onwards.

Egyptians 
liked art. By about 
3000 Bc, they had 
developed a new 
technique of 
painting on walls, 
using a mixture 
of pigments and 
melted beeswax. 
When the painting 
was complete, they 
heated it to make it melt 
into the surface of the wall. 
This method is called encaustic 
painting. The result was rich 
and colorful, and many of 
the paintings can still be seen 
today. The technique was 
revived by US artist Jasper 


Johns in the 1960s,

iE: 2600 Bc, the Egyptian 
pharaoh Djoser and his 
architect Imhotep created the 
step pyramid at Sakkara — the 
first pyramid to be made 
entirely of stone. It was 
designed to be Djoser's tomb 
and rose in six steps to a height 
of 200 ft (60 m). At that time, 
nearly all buildings were made 
of bricks or wood. Small stone 
buildings did exist, but Djoser’s 
gigantic pile of square-cut stone 
blocks must have seemed truly 


amazing. The pyramids of 
Egypt are still some of the 
world’s most impressive stone 
buildings. The tallest one is 
the Great Pyramid of Khufu 
at Giza. It is made from about 
two million huge blocks of 
limestone and stands 482 ft 
(147 m) high.

casting 


| casting is a way of 
making hollow objects. A 
lump of clay is covered with 
wax, which is then modelled 
and covered with plaster. When 
the mold is heated, the wax 
runs out, leaving a gap between 
the clay and plaster. Molten 
metal is poured into the gap 
and left to cool. This process is 
thought to have been invented 
by the Sumerians. The ancient 
Egyptians, who probably 
learned the technique from 
them, were using it by 2200 sc, 
and it is still used today. 


Tea 


Shen Nong 


radition says that the 
Chinese emperor Shen 
Nong was boiling water 


beneath a camellia tree in about 
2700 Bc when a leaf fell in, 
creating the first cup of tea. 
The new drink, however, was 
not mentioned in a book 
until about AD 800, and 
it took another 800 
years for tea to reach 
Europe. By 1657, the 
first “cuppa” had been 
sold in London, and tea 
became wildly 
fashionable.

the idea that the life force, or

make the chi start flowing 
smoothly again.

organisms were at work, and 
mixed in some of this 
whenever they made fresh

the sour dough multiplied, they 
produced bubbles of carbon

finished bread much lighter. 


Silk 


Se is still considered to be 
the most desirable of fabrics. 
It was first made in China 
about 46 centuries ago, and its 
origin was a closely guarded 
secret. The silkworm and the 
luxurious, fibrous covering of 
its cocoon are said to have been 
discovered by a 14-year-old girl 
called Xilingshi, who was the 
wife of the emperor Huang Di. 
Nearly 3,000 years passed 
before the secret was revealed, 
spreading to India, Japan, and 
eventually Europe. 


Arch 


ithout arches, the only 

way to hold up 
doorways and roofs is with 
straight beams. An arch can 
span a greater distance than a 
straight beam, allowing wall 
openings to be larger. The first 
arches, built in India and 
Mesopotamia in about 2500 Bc, 
were produced simply by 
building the top of the walls 
out toward each other until 
they met. By 100 Bc, Roman 
builders were using semi- 
circular arches in almost all 
their buildings. 


Carpet 


he ancient Egyptians were 
weaving carpets of a sort by 
about 2500 Bc, but nomadic 


tribes in eastern countries, such 
as Turkestan, soon became the 
greatest carpet makers. One 
carpet found preserved by the 
cold in Siberia had been buried 
with a nomad chieftain 2,500 
years previously, showing that 
carpets were highly prized. 
Carpets have often been 
associated with magic and 
romance. In 48 Bc, the 
Egyptian queen Cleopatra 
introduced herself to the 
Roman emperor Julius 
Caesar by jumping out 
of a rolled-up carpet. 


Glass 


lass had humble 

beginnings. It was 
probably discovered by 
accident. Made by 
heating sand with 
limestone and wood ash, it 
first appeared in the form of 
small ornamental beads in 
about 2500 bc. The basic 
formula may have been 
discovered in Mesopotamia, but 
it was the ancient Egyptians 
who began to develop it into 
the material we know today. By 
1450 Bc, they were making 
glass bottles in molds, and over 
the next 1000 years their 
techniques spread to Europe 
and the East. 


Ink 


he first ink came in the 

form of a solid block made 
from soot mixed with glue, and 
had to be wetted before it 
could be used for writing. The 
ancient Egyptians wrote on 
papyrus with ink and a pen 
made from a reed, using a 
flowing style of writing called 
hieratic. In China, scribes wrote 
their characters with a brush. 
You can still buy blocks of 
Chinese ink exactly like those 
made 4500 years ago.

they were being used in 
Babylonia. Three hundred years 
later, they were also being used 
in Syria and ancient Palestine. 
They arrived in Egypt when a

used horse-drawn chariots to

Barrel vault 


nce builders had 

discovered how to make 
arches, they were soon using 
them to hold up the most 
crucial and awkward part of 
any building — the roof. By 
building a row of arches one 
behind the other, they created 
a strong, tunnel-shaped 
structure, Because of its shape, 
this is called a barrel vault. It 
was in use soon after the arch 
was invented, and remained a 
favorite feature with builders 
until modern times. 


Bathroom 


bathroom was considered 

essential by some builders 
as long as 4,000 years ago. 
Even relatively humble houses 
excavated at Mohenjo-Daro in 
the Indus valley (in what is 
now Pakistan), and dating from 
about 2000 sc, had bathrooms 
with drains. Some even had 
toilets, of a sort, with seats to 
sit on. Further west, in about 
1700 Bc, the wealthier Minoans 
of ancient Crete had more 
lavish bathrooms to which they 
could sneak off for a quiet soak.

or simply to play tunes. The 
idea spread to Japan, India, and 
the West, where monks were 
playing rows of bells by about 
AD 850. Five hundred years 
later, the idea was adapted for 
public timekeeping, with the

WHEELS OF WAR 


AS WITH many inventions, 
military commanders were 
pioneers in the development 
of wheeled transportation. Large 
vehicles were probably first used for 
royal funerals, but soldiers soon saw 
that wheels could deliver men 
and materials to the battle 
front more quickly than 
feet or pack-animals. 

It was only later that 
chariots were used for fighting. 
Eventually, as soldiers became more skilful 
at riding horses, chariots went out of use. 


Chariots were used 
for sports as well as 
war. Here, Assyrian

wooden yoke. The charioteer rode in a raised section at the front 
that pivoted with the axle. 


THE FIGHTING CHARIOT 

The introduction of horses and a lighter construction, 
including spoked wheels (%* see page 31), made the chariot 
into a formidable fighting platform for one or two soldiers. It 
had only two wheels, allowing it to take sharp turns, but 
could be pulled by as many as four horses. These lightweight 
chariots helped win many battles.

Iron 


hen iron was first 

discovered in southeast 
Asia, about 4,000 years ago, it 
was considered more valuable 
than gold. As ways of 
extracting it and working it 
improved, people were able 
to make better use of its 
strength and flexibility. By 
about 1200 sc, the Iron Age 
had begun, pushing humanity 
faster than ever towards the 
modern world. Because iron is 
hard to melt, early users had to 
invent new techniques, such as 
shaping it by hammering rather 
than casting.

stone and made higher in the

pollen from a male plant.

1800 Bc, people were buying 

and selling male date-palm 

flowers for this purpose.

LEARNING THE BASICS 


Corset 


Pee have never been 
satisfied with the shape of 
their bodies. Four thousand 
years ago, Minoan women 
living on the island of Crete in 
the Mediterranean Sea were 
wearing corsets to pinch in 
their waists. And it may not 
just have been the women who 
wanted to accentuate their 
curves: wall-paintings from 
about 1500 sc, excavated at the 
palace of King Minos, also 
show Minoan men looking 
suspiciously wasp-waisted. 


Running water 


he ancient bathrooms of 

Mohenjo-Daro in the Indus 
valley had everything but 
running water. This wasn’t 
good enough for wealthy 
Minoans on Crete. They 
wanted their water on tap, and 
excavations show that they got 


it. Pipes and drains ran 
throughout the great palace of 
King Minos at Knossos, making 
bath time more of a pleasure 
than a chore. 


Child’s swing 


Nex really knows when 
the swing was invented or, 
more probably, developed from 
a dangling creeper. But a swing 
was found in excavations of 
Minoan Crete dating back to 
1600 Bc. The swing is just one 
of the ancient amusements, 
like jacks (fivestones) or blind 
man’s buff, that have kept 
children happy for countless 
generations. 


Brass 


lee is an alloy, or mixture, 
of copper and zinc. Its 
strength, bright color, and 
resistance to corrosion make it 
a good material for many 


objects. Its early history is 
difficult to trace because it was 
often confused with bronze. As 
late as the 18th century, many 
people used brass that was 
made by a method dating back 
to its discovery. In this process, 
copper and zinc ore were 
heated together, producing 
brass. Because the zinc ore that 
they used was called calamine, 
the product was known as 
calamine brass. 


Flag 


\ J Je don't treat flags with 

such great respect today, 
but when they were invented in 
China they had life-or-death 
significance and played a vital 
part in battles. If a leader's flag 
was captured by the enemy, it 
was all over. Strangely enough, 
the first important flag we 
know about, which belonged to 
the first ruler of the Zhou 
dynasty in about 1100 Bc, was 
white — a color that people in 
the West now associate with 
surrender and defeat. 


Gloves 


Ithough the weather does 

sometimes get cold in 
Egypt, the fine linen gloves 
found in the tomb of the boy 
king Tutankhamun were 
probably more ceremonial than 
practical. They show, however, 
that even in this generally hot 
country, some people were 
wearing gloves by 1350 Bc. 
People in colder places must 
have worn them too, but we do 
not have any evidence of this 
before about AD 700. 


Secret writing 


s soon as people began to 

write, they started to worry 
that the wrong people would 
read what they had written. 
Secret writing, or encryption, 
has a long history. The first 
known example is in ancient 
Egyptian hieroglyphs of about 
1500 sc. It may have been

conceal. But some writers of 
books in the Old Testament in 
the Bible did try to hide the 
meaning of their text by 
reversing the entire alphabet. 


Shoes 


he earliest shoes were 

sandals, but by about 
1500 Bc, in Mesopotamia, 
people were wearing shoes that 
completely enclosed their feet. 
They were similar to what we 
would now call moccasins — 
single pieces of soft leather 
drawn up around the ankles 
with a rawhide thong. At about 
the same time, the Minoans of 
Crete were stepping into calf- 
length boots for winter wear. 


Clepsydra 


he Egyptians usually 

told the time from 
the Sun, but were also 
using a clock called a 
clepsydra by about 
1500 Bc. The basic 
model was just a pot 
of water with a hole 
near the bottom and 
marks down the side. 
As the water ran out, its 
level showed the time. 
The flow slowed as the pot 
emptied, so the marks had to 
be closer together near the 
bottom, making them hard to 
read. An improved model, 
invented in about 270 Bc, 
worked the other way around: 
water ran into the pot, moving 
a pointer to show the time. 


CLEPSYDRA This is a cast of a clepsydra found x 
at the ancient Egyptian temple at Karnak. The 
clepsydra dates from 1415-1380 Bc.

Trumpet 


Ame is any kind of tube 
that you sound by 
squeezing air into it through 
your lips. The Australian 
didgeridoo is technically a 
trumpet, as is the shofar, made 
from a ram’s horn, which is still 
used in Jewish rituals. The 
earliest existing silver trumpet 
dates from about 1500 Bc and 
comes from ancient Egypt. It 
was probably used for ritual 
purposes. The Romans 
developed trumpets for use in 
battle, but it was another 1,000 


c 3,000,000 Bc — 500 Bc 


years before the trumpet really 
began to develop into the 
musical instrument that is 
played today. 


Armor 


ody armor was worn in 

battle until the 17th century, 
when improved weapons made 
it useless. It developed little by 
little — helmets, belts, reinforced 
shirts — over thousands of 
years. In about 1100 Bc, 
Chinese soldiers were wearing 
armor made from layers of 
rhinoceros hide. By 800 Bc, 
Greek warriors were wearing 
substantial bronze helmets, 
metal shin guards, and bronze 
items called cuirasses, which 
totally covered their chest.

Ox: of various kinds are as 
old as boats, but were 
probably perfected by the 
Phoenicians, seafarers who 
came from an area that is now 
mainly Lebanon. By 1100 zc, 
they were the greatest traders 
in the eastern Mediterranean, 
and by 700 be they had 
developed the bireme, a ship 
with an extra deck to allow for 
twice as many oars. Later, the 
Greeks developed this into the 
formidable trireme, a fighting 
ship with oars on three levels. 


Camel 


TL ancient Egyptians knew 
about camels as early as 
3000 Bc, but they do not seem 
to have used them to carry 
anything. The idea of loading 
this unfriendly but almost 
desert-proof beast with up to 
1100 lb of goods came from 
Mesopotamia about 2000 years 
later. The people here also bred 
the camel into a lighter, faster 
animal for riding.

reindeer and horses. Developed 
as a practical necessity, skating 
eventually became a sport, with 
the canals of the Netherlands 
providing ideal ice rinks from 
medieval times. 


Knitting 


disadvantage of woven 

fabrics is that people need 
a loom to make them. 
Although early looms were 
portable, clothes that could be 
made using nothing but a pair 
of needles had obvious appeal 
to nomadic people. So it is 
likely that knitting originated 
among the nomads of the 
deserts of north Africa in about 
1000 Bc. It seems to have 
reached Europe by way of 
Egypt, where archaeologists 
have found knitted items 
dating from about 450 Bc.

Iron-tipped 
plowshare 


he part of a plow that lifts 

and turns the soil, the 
plowshare, wore away quickly 
when it was made of wood or 
bronze. Iron is harder than 
bronze, but was an expensive 
material in ancient times. The 
answer was to continue to use a 
wooden plowshare but use iron 
to protect the tip. Plows of this 
type were probably being used 
in ancient Palestine by 900 bc.

consonants appeared in Syria

1600 Bc. By about 900 Bc, the 
Greeks had adapted this to 
their own language by adding 
vowels. This was the first 
alphabet that recorded speech 
accurately, and it became the 
ancestor of several others, 
including the alphabet used 
for English.

lamps, with a spike or channel 
to hold a wick, existed in 
ancient China and Egypt, but 
the first really practical lamps — 
they even had handles — 
appeared in ancient Greece in 
about 700 sc. They usually ran 
on olive or nut oil. None of 
these early lamps gave out 
enough light for detailed work 
after dark. (%* See also New 
lamps for old.) 


NEW LAMPS FOR OLD 


TO MAKE a successful lamp, three 
things have to be just right: the 
fuel, the fuel reservoir, and the 
wick. Oil burns with less smoke 
than fat. The reservoir should be 
easy to fill and convenient to carry. 
The wick is needed to spread the 
oil into a thin film so that it 


will vaporize 
and burn.

THE FIRST LAMPS 
The first cave painters may have worked by the light of 
burning branches. It is possible that while they were 
cooking they noticed that a branch burned for longer if 
it was soaked in fat. From there, it would have been a 
short step to the first lamp — a container of moss or twigs 
dipped in fat or oil. Moss or twigs spread the oil but they 
tended to burn away.

years ago that the shadow 
cast by a vertical pole could be

scale of hours, probably with 
a raised part at one end to 
cast a shadow on the scale, 
and it had to be turned to

Metal coins

often exchanged pieces of 
precious metal in return for

wasted time checking the 
quality and weight of all the 
different pieces. The Lydians, 
from what is now western 
Turkey, had an idea. They 
standardized the quality and 
weight of the pieces, and 
stamped them with the king’s 
mark as proof of their value. 
They had invented coins.

Thales observed that 
amber rubbed on

saw was the result of 
static electricity, but it 
was more than 2000 
years before an English 
doctor, William 
Gilbert, investigated 
this thoroughly (* see 
page 85). He coined 
the term “electric”, for 
the attracting effect, 
from the Greek word 
“elektron” meaning “amber”.

wo and a half thousand years ago, a small town in Italy 
was home to an extraordinary group of thinkers. They 
discovered facts about music and mathematics that we still use 
today, but more important, they came to believe that the world 
around us is based on mathematical rules 
The Greek philosopher Pythagoras 
was about 50 years old when he 
crossed the Ionian Sea to settle in 
Crotona (now Crotone) and gather

ae of a Po es like reincarnation, that had nothing to do with mathematics. ¥ 
Pythagoras is best known for the theorem that bears his name, 
but this was just one of many relationships that his group 
found between numbers. The Pythagoreans were 
fascinated by the fact that 1+ 2+3+4=10, 
and that these numbers can be arranged into 
a triangle, which they called the tetraktys. 
Their belief that the whole universe was based 
on a mystic order, or kosmos, was strengthened 
when they discovered what appeared to be a = 
link between the tetraktys and music. 
Starting with a musical string that had a 
length of one unit, they found that dividing it into 
two, three, or four parts produced new notes 
that all harmonized perfectly with each 
other. This doesn’t explain how complex 
music works, but for the simple 
instruments that the Pythagoreans used 
it worked. This discovery not only laid 
the foundations of the science of music, 
but also encouraged the Pythagoreans’ 
belief that mathematics was the key to 
understanding the universe. 


FAULTY SCIENCE 
The study of music was often 
confused by dependence on 
Pythagoras’ rules. This 1490 
woodcut is meant to show his 
principles, but it wouldn’t have 
worked! He only experimented 
with strings and never thought 
about music made with more 
than one instrument.

c 3,000,000 Bc — 500 Bc 


The Pythagoreans were among the first thinkers to 
contemplate an Earth not at the centre of everything. 
They speculated that the planets revolved around a 
“central fire” — although they probably didn’t think of 
Earth as one of the planets. Some of Pythagoras’ followers 
speculated on a mystical “music of the spheres” created 
by movements of mathematically spaced planets. But this 
beautiful theory was based on speculation, not facts. 

We have moved on since Pythagoras’ time. We have 
learned that mathematics is a powerful tool to describe 


THE DEBATER 

This detail from a frieze at the 
University of Athens probably 
shows an accurate view of how 
the Pythagoreans tested their 
theories, basing them on belief 
and argument, not experiment. 
Their mathematics was limited 
to what we now call geometry 


The tetraktys was a triangle figure 
made of ten dots. It included the 
numbers 4, 3, 2, and 1, like their 
theory of music. The Pythagoreans 
tried to describe everything in the 
world with just a few ideas.

THE AGE: OB 


AUTHORITY 


MANY NEW DISCOVERIES 
and inventions were made 
between 500 Bc and 
AD 1400, a period that also 
saw the flowering of ancient 
Greece and Rome and of 
the world’s great religions. 
But most people’ thought 
remained bound by 
tradition, by accepted 
belief, and by the authority 
of those in power.

IRON IN BUILDING This is the 
Temple of Concord, one of about 20 
temples in Agrigento dating from the 
5th and 6th centuries Bc. 


Ancient Greek 
buildings may 
have been 
inspired by 
earlier buildings 
whose roofs were 


Sturdy column

capital, known as 
the Doric style 


Iron in building 


Te Victorians are usually 
thought of as being the first 
people to use iron as a 
structural material. But 2,300 
years before Queen Victoria, 
ancient Greek builders in 
Agrigentum (now Agrigento, 
Sicily) installed a huge iron 
beam 16 ft (5 m) long in one of 
the city’s many temples. The 
ancient Greeks were also using 
other, smaller beams and all 
kinds of iron fixtures to hold 
their blocks of stone together. 


Theatre scenery 


Aeschylus 


he word “scenery” comes 

from the dressing room, or 
“skene”, once used by actors in 
ancient Greece. It was in a 
building at the back of the 
stage and, by the time of the 
playwright Aeschylus, it was 
also being used to support 


colored panels, which formed a 
background for the actors. For 
the first performance of his 
trilogy of plays the Oresteia, 
Aeschylus created an even 
better background. He had the 
plain panels painted with 
colorful pictures to create what 
we now call scenery. 


CENTRAL HEATING The Greeks 
may have circulated hot air around 
these pillars in the ruined city of 
Phaselis to heat the room above. 


Cause of solar 
eclipses 


Anaxagoras 


E= the sophisticated 
people of Athens regarded 
eclipses of the Sun with fear, 
until the Greek philosopher 
Anaxagoras explained them. 
Anaxagoras came to Athens 
from what is now Turkey. He 
said that a solar eclipse was just 
the Moon getting in the way of 
the Sun. This was true, but he 
also thought that the Sun was a 
white-hot rock less than half 
the size of Greece. 


Central heating 


ost people think the 

Romans were the first 
builders of central heating 
systems, but the Greeks may 
have built them first. The 
Romans called their under-floor 
hot air system a hypocaust, and 


supported by 
tree-trunks 


“hypocaust” is actually a Greek 
word meaning “burning below”. 
The ruined Greek city of 
Phaselis, now in Turkey, has 
buildings with hollow floors, 
just like a Roman hypocaust. 
This suggests that the Greeks 
were using central heating as 
early as 450 Bc. 


Earth, air, fire, 
and water 


Empedocles 


Fase Greek philosophers 
spent centuries wondering 
what the universe was made of. 
By about 350 Bc, most of them 
had accepted a theory put 
forward by the statesman and 
poet Empedocles about 100 
years earlier. He said that 
everything was made of earth, 
air, fire, and water mixed in 
various proportions. His theory 
may seem funny to us, but it 
was the first one that suggested 
the existence of chemical 
elements, and it eventually led 
to modern chemistry.

Signs of the

t was probably the 
Babylonians who devised 
the signs of the zodiac. These 
represent the 12 groupings of 

stars through which the Sun 
seems to travel during the 
year. A cuneiform tablet dated 
419 Bc carries a horoscope 
using the signs. It was the 
ancient Greeks, however, who 
named the band of sky that 
contains the Ram, the Bull, and 
the other constellations, They 
called it “zodiakos kyklos,” or 
“circle of animals.”

Flying actor 


Sophocles 


Wwe an ancient Greek 
playwright got into an 
impossible tangle with a plot, 
the usual way out was to have 
a god descend from heaven 


and fix the mess. The god was 
played by an actor hoisted into 


one of many theories that developed 


the air with a crane. The same 
device, called a mechane, was 
also useful for comic effects: 

a character in one play by 
Aristophanes flies up to 
heaven on a dung beetle. 


Planned city 


Hippodamus of Miletus 


M™ ancient cities have 
some kind of regular 
grid plan, but Hippodamus of 
Miletus was the first real town 
planner. He was a colorful 
and influential character who 
believed that buildings should 
be grouped according to their 
function. He put his thoughts 
into practice when he 
became involved in the 
rebuilding of the Greek 
port of Piraeus and the 
construction of a new 
Greek settlement in 
southern Italy.

Catapult 


= before gunpowder was 
invented, huge wooden 
catapults were used to hurl 
missiles, such as iron-tipped 
darts or boulders. The first 
examples may have been used 
in 399 Bc in the war between 
Rome and the ancient empire 
of Carthage in north Africa. A 
pair of arms were swung back 
to hold the missile, twisting 
and tightening cords made 

of animal sinews. When the 
tension in the cords was 
released, the arms sprang 
forward, launching the missile 
up to 1,640 ft (500 m) away,

soldier had to rest one

other end on the ground and 
bent the bow into the firing 
position, ready to be released 
by a trigger. It was a deadly

sphere held the stars, while the 
Sun, the Moon, and the planets 
had several spheres each. Their

flaws, Eudoxus’ theory was, 
with some refinements, the best 
on offer for 2,000 years.

could be arranged in different

to what we now believe, and 
not bad for someone who lived

Sun was not overhead, but 
angled at about seven degrees 
from the vertical. Eratosthenes

caused by the curvature of 
Earth. Using the idea that 
there were 360 degrees in a 
circle, and knowing the 
distance between Aswan and 
Alexandria, he was able to 
calculate Earth’s circumference 
as the distance between Aswan 
and Alexandria x 360 + 7. 
Eratosthenes’ calculation came 
up with the answer of about 
25,700 miles (41,143 km). 
The true value is about 
25,000 miles (40,000 km), 

so he wasn’t too far off.

Archimedes 


A= pulley is a rope 
passed around a wheel, 
and it is useful for lifting things 
vertically. One end of the rope 
is attached to the load and the 
other end of the rope is pulled 
to lift the load. Greek inventor 
Archimedes developed the 
compound pulley from the 
simple pulley by wrapping the 
rope around several wheels 
instead of one, which enabled 
people to lift heavier loads. It 
meant pulling the rope farther, 
but took less effort at any one 
time. Compound pulleys, using 
chains rather than ropes, are 
still used for heavy lifting jobs.

DOING SCIENCE IN THE BATH 


Archimedes solves a weighty problem 
and discovers how things float 


hy do some things float and others sink? This is an 
important question for ship designers, but the ancient 
Greek scientist Archimedes may have found the answer while 
he was checking the quality of a king's jewelry. 

Archimedes was born in Syracuse, Sicily, in about 290 Bc. 
He was related to the king, Hieron II, so had plenty of time to 
think and write about mathematics and mechanics. Hieron often 
called upon Archimedes to help him with problems. He had a gold 
wreath that he thought contained some silver, and he asked 
Archimedes to find out exactly how much. Archimedes knew he 
could check the wreath if he could measure its density 

(its mass in relation to its volume) because silver is less 
dense than gold. The obvious way to find the density of something is to

make the water overflow, then take the wreath out and see how much 
water was needed to fill the bathtub again. That would be the volume of 
the wreath. 

Archimedes may also have 
noticed that he felt lighter in 
his bath. Left to itself, bath 
water doesn’t rise or fall, so 
every part of it must get 

an upward push that 
balances its own 
weight. The same 
force must push 
on anything 
placed in the 
water. When 
anything is immersed 
in a fluid, even partly, 
it feels an upward

call this Archimedes’ principle. Using this, Archimedes ye 
could have immersed the wreath in water and noted 
how much weight it lost, then have worked out 
how much silver the wreath contained, without 
measuring its volume at all. 

Archimedes probably didn’t do this. 
Nevertheless, he had solved Hieron’s problem. 
He may also have discovered why things 
float or sink. Objects placed in water move 
downward until their weight is balanced by the weight of the 
water they displace, then stay at that level. If their average density 
is more than that of water, they cannot float. They sink. 

Later, Hieron had more serious problems. When Archimedes 
was an old man, the Romans besieged Syracuse. Once again, 
he was called upon. He used his scientific knowledge to 
design ships, catapults, and even, it is said, giant 
mirrors to burn Roman ships with the Sun’s 
rays. In 211 Bc, the city was eventually 
captured. The Roman soldiers 
rampaged through it, burning 
and killing. Sadly, one of their 
victims was Archimedes, 
the genius who did 
science in 
his bath.

GREEK WARSHIP 
The magnificent trireme, a 
Greek ship with three layers 
of oars, showed how much 
importance the Greeks attached 
to winning battles at sea. It was 
extremely fast, and could sink 
an enemy ship with its built-in 
battering ram. Fighting 
techniques moved on, and the 
trireme evolved into a ship that 
could carry large numbers of 
heavily armed soldiers. 


Archimedes was a genius 
who needed only the 
simplest of equipment to 
make profound discoveries.

Pipe organ 


Ctesibius of Alexandria 


he Greek inventor Ctesibius 

was the first person to put 
together all three parts of an 
organ: pipes, a keyboard, and a 
supply of air. To get a steady 
sound from the pipes, Ctesibius 
realized that he needed to 
supply air to them at a steady 
pressure. So he attached them 
to a large container, open at 
the bottom and standing in a 
tank of water. As he pumped 
air into the container, the 
weight of water pressing on 
the air kept the pressure fairly 
constant, even though the 
amount of air in the container 
varied. His organ, called a 
hydrolos because of 
the water (from 
hydro, the Greek 
word for “water”), 
was loud enough 
to play outdoors.

| Chinese writing, each 
pictorial character stands for 
a word, not a sound. It works 
like numbers in Western 
languages. People in different 
Western countries all 
understand the symbol “2,” but 
pronounce it “two,” “deux,” 
and so on, depending on their 
language. This principle is 
useful in China, because 
speakers of its many local 
dialects can all read the same 
writing, but only if the same 
characters are used everywhere. 
The standardization of Chinese 
writing was just one of the 
many reforms that the forceful 
emperor Shi Huangdi 
introduced in about 220 Bc, 
as part of his plan to turn the 
separate states of China into 
one nation.

through Greek and Latin. Early 
Greek writers used hardly any 
punctuation, and didn’t even 
put spaces between words. 
Aristophanes of Byzantium, 
who was librarian of the library 
of Alexandria in about 200 bc, 
was the first to remedy this. By 
adding punctuation to Greek 
text, he began the trend that 
led to modern punctuation, 
including one mark that has a 
Greek name — the apostrophe.

soldiers in Sumeria may 
already have been using it a

thousands of iron rings looped 
together over a leather or cloth 
backing, chain mail offered 
protection against swords and 
spears. It was more flexible 
than a cuirass so it was

by the Greek astronomer 
Hipparchus, who noticed that 
his star positions had all 
moved by the same amount 
from those measured by earlier 
Greek and Babylonian 
astronomers. With a little 
scientific detective work, he 
found out that the change was 
caused by a very slow shifting 
of Earth’s axis of rotation.

mathematics that studies

or distance of far away objects.

books and he became known 
as the founder of modern

PAPER AND PRINTING 


Some copies of this 1455 Bible, the first book to 


be printed, were on vellum, others on paper. 


The invention of letterpress printing in 


about 1450 made it easier for people 
to produce multiple copies of a book. 
But if books had continued to be 
printed on vellum (a kind of leather), 
they would have remained expensive. 
Paper arrived just in time to turn a 
good invention into a great one. 


special days. When officials 
began mismanaging it to suit 
themselves, reform became 
urgent. Julius Caesar 
introduced a year of 365 days 
with a leap year every fourth 
year. While he was at it, he 
rearranged the months, naming 
July after himself and August 
after Augustus, who was later 
to be his successor. The result 
was very close to the calendar 
we use now.

hard, and watched the glass 
swell into a bubble without 
any mold to shape it. For 
some time, most glassworkers 
continued to shape glass in 
molds, but the glassblowing 
process eventually became as 
important as molding. The 
resulting smooth, rounded 
vessels were shipped all over 
the Roman Empire.

Sumerian builders were 
building rudimentary domes 
more than 4,000 years ago, but 
the first great dome builders 
were the Romans. They made 
extensive use of concrete. One 
of their earliest domes, which 
roofed a palace for the emperor 
Nero in AD 68, was 50 ft 
(15 m) in diameter. The dome 
of the Pantheon in Rome, 
which was completed 60 years 
later and still stands today, is 
nearly three times as wide. 


Bolt 


screw thread can exert a 

large force when turned 
with a small force, making 
bolts and screws ideal for 


holding things together. The 
thread is very difficult to make, 
especially the female thread on 
the inside of a nut, which is 
used in conjunction with the 
male thread on a bolt. By about 
AD 50, a tool for cutting these, 
called a tap, was in use. At 
about the same time, the 
Greek scientist and inventor 
Hero of Alexandria was writing 
about machines with parts that 
had to be held together with 
well made bolts.

invented in Greece about 750 
years earlier (* see page 35). 


Topiary 


TS the art of clipping 
or growing shrubs into 
geometric shapes, was a 
fashionable pastime in Rome in 
about ad 50. It is most likely to 
have begun as some pruning 
that got out of hand, although 
a friend of the emperor Augustus 
claimed to have invented it. As 
well as being interesting in its 
own right, Roman topiary also 
suggests that the Romans had 
developed a form of shears 
suitable for use in the garden. 


Wheelbarrow 


he wheelbarrow should 

have been an obvious 
invention once the wheel had 
arrived (% see page 19), but it 
appears that no one thought of 
it for another 3,500 years. 


Chinese labourers were 
trundling barrows around 
from about AD 50 onwards, 
but people still didn’t catch 
on in the West. The earliest 
evidence we have of European 
builders and miners using this 
versatile one-wheeled vehicle 
are depictions of some in 
medieval illustrations.

described his machine in a 
book. We don’t know whether 
he ever built one — or if it 
would have been reliable!

Formula 
for the area

Hero of Alexandria 


here is a well known 

formula for figuring out the 
area of a triangle — half the base 
times the height — but if the 
height isn’t known, it has to be 
calculated before the formula 
can be applied. Nearly 2,000 
years ago, Hero of Alexandria 
discovered a different formula 
that doesn’t involve knowing 
the height of the triangle, just 
the length of its three sides. His 
formula is: area = \|s(s-a)(s-b) 
(s-c)] — where a, b, and c are 
the sides and s is half the 
perimeter. Despite its simplicity, 
the formula is not widely used.

out again through two nozzles 
at the sides. These acted like 
ittle rockets, and made the ball

Ptolemy 
Po was an 


astronomer and 
mathematician who 
lived in ancient Egypt. 
Five centuries before 
im, the Greek 
astronomer Eudoxus 
ad explained the 
movements of the stars 
and planets with his 
theory of celestial 
spheres (* see page 44), 
but this did not account 
or all of the details of the 
planets’ movements or 
why they sometimes 
changed brightness. It 
became clear that the 
motions of the planets 
could not be explained with 
the simple idea that they 
moved in circles. Ptolemy 
solved the problem by 
suggesting that each heavenly 
body moved in small circles, or 
epicycles, at the same time as it 
orbited Earth in a large circle, 
generally accepted as the truth 
by astronomers for the next 
1,500 years. 


Crank 


crank converts a to-and-fro 

movement into a rotary 
movement. For example, bicycle 
pedals convert the up- and- 
down motion of the legs into 
the rotary motion of the wheels. 
The date for when the crank 
was invented depends on how 
it is defined. The first rotary 
querns (* see page 36) could 
qualify as early cranks, and 
they go back to 600 Bc, but it is 
not until AD 150 that there is 
evidence of the first “bent rod” 
crank being used. One is 
depicted in a Chinese tomb- 
model of a winnowing machine.

and was not really the kind of

It was probably the Romans, in 
about AD 150, who first started 
using soap to wash things, and 
Roman women were using a 
kind of soap as a shampoo one 
hundred years earlier.

Algebra 


Diophantus of Alexandria

arithmetic without actual 
numbers developed slowly, 
starting in Babylonia and 
ancient Egypt, with calculations 
expressed entirely in words. 
When Diophantus wrote his 
book Arithmetica in about 

AD 250, he introduced symbols 
to replace some of the words. 
He also worked out the rules 
for powers, and explained how 
negative quantities behave 
when multiplied. His book also 
contained some difficult 
mathematical problems, 

which became known as 
Diophantine equations and 

are still of interest today.

Book with 
pages 


he first books had no 

pages — they were written 
on a continuous scroll, Roman 
emperor Julius Caesar is 
sometimes credited with 
having been the first to fold a 
scroll into pages instead of 
rolling it, making it easier for a 
messenger to carry. Both the 
ancient Greeks and the 
Romans had ring-bound 
notebooks with wooden pages, 
but it wasn’t until about 
AD 350 that the book with 
pages, or codex, became the 
standard way of storing words. 
The early Christians found the 
more compact codex useful for 
hiding their forbidden texts 
under their clothes. (%* See 
also Birth of the book.) 


BIRTH OF THE BOOK 


FROM ABOUT 50 BC, books, 
particularly religious texts, started 
getting longer and the codex 
gradually became more attractive. 
Papytus, the usual writing material 
at that time (%* see page 24), tended 
to crack when folded into pages, so 
most of the new codexes were made 
from parchment (%* see page 28), a 
material that was known in 2400 Bc 
but had been little used. 


WHY PAGES WON 

As well as being a handy shape, a codex 
allows people to tur to any section 
instantly or flip the pages to scan the 
contents. Because the pages of books can 
have writing on both sides, it is also 
possible to pack in twice as many words 
as ona scroll of the same size.

the Codex Alexandrinus, was written a century 
later. Both are kept in the British Museum.

It was only when wealthy

in the 4th century AD 
that rods more than 
about 3 ft 3 in (1 in)

They were made of

they were long they had 
to be made in several 
sections. So they looked 
a bit like a modern,

hospitals and also gave help to

Exiguus had the idea of using 
the birth of Christ as a starting 
point (aD 1), and calculated 
that this was 754 years after the 
founding of Rome. This is now

made of fine silk, looked

Others, designed as wall-

Flame-thrower 


Callinicus of Heliopolis 


Se fire to an enemy’s 
property usually means 
having to get close to it, but a 
weapon that shoots a jet of 
flame can do damage at a 
distance. The first people to try 
this were the Byzantines from 
Constantinople (present-day 
Istanbul in Turkey) in the 
7th century AD. Possibly 
invented by a Syrian architect 
called Callinicus, “Greek fire” — 
a sticky, flaming liquid thrown 
in pots or squirted from tubes 
— was much feared by their 
enemies. Greek fire helped the 
Byzantines to defeat a Saracen

dates from about ap 700. It has 
no buttons or other fastenings, 
and is simply wrapped around 
the body in a particular way 
and tied with a sash, which is 
called an obi. The kimono 
developed from a similar 
garment worn by courtiers in 
China as early as 200 Bc. By the 
17th century, 1,000 years of 
further development had 
turned it into the beautiful 
garment we know today.

Systematic 
use of zero 


Muhammad al-Khwarizmi 


I is accepted today that a 
zero at the end of a number 
makes it 10 times bigger: e.g. 
20 is 10 times bigger than 2. 
But early number systems 
were rather vague about using 
zero in this way. They used it 
to show that the tens column, 
for example, had nothing in 
it, but rarely used it in the 
units column. The first 
mathematician to use zero in 


known as Munchen, meaning 
“home of the monks.” It will 
grow to become Germany's third 


today’s systematic way was 
Muhammad al-Khwarizmi, in 
about AD 820. His ideas 
reached the West through the 
efforts of the French scholar 
Gerbert of Aurillac, who 
became Pope in AD 999.

mallpox and the less 

dangerous disease measles 
have similar early symptoms. 
Persian physician ar-Razi, 
known in the West as Rhazes, 


told doctors how to tell the 
difference in about AD 900. He 
said that “inquietude, nausea, 
and anxiety are more frequent 
in the Measles than in the 
Smallpox; while the pain in the 
back is more peculiar to the 
Smallpox than to the measles.”

EXPLOSIVE EVENTS 


THE HISTORY OF GUNPOWDER is not clear. The secret was certainly known 
first in China, but nobody is sure whether people in the West learned it 
from the East or discovered it for themselves. English scientist Roger Bacon 
recorded the formula for making gunpowder in the 13th century, but it is 
possible that he discovered it by studying the works of Arabs, who had 


themselves learned it from the Chinese.

which were needed to represent 
the speech sounds of the region.

known substance that 
would burn when packed into

Chinese alchemists were 
surprised to discover that 
when three well known 
ingredients were mixed in the 
right proportions, they could 
produce an intense flame or 
explosion. They put their 
discovery to work in fireworks 
for fun and rockets for war. 
From the 14th century onward, 
Europeans used gunpowder in 
cannons and firearms and this 
changed the whole nature of 
warfare. Gunpowder remained 
the only known explosive until 
the 17th century. (* See also 
Explosive events.) 


CANNONS AND ROCKETS 
Gunpowder packed into a tube 
burns so intensely that it can 
throw objects out of the tube, 
forming a crude cannon, or propel 
the tube itself through the air as a 
rocket. Chinese scientists used 
both of these effects for military 
purposes, and may also have used 
gunpowder to make bombs. 


FIREWORKS 

Gunpowder was probably first 
used in fireworks. Even an 
inaccurate rocket made a good 
display, experimental cannons 
could throw decorative balls of 
fire, and the explosive properties 
could provide fun in firecrackers.

Paper money 


AS China grew wealthier, 
increasing amounts of cash 
were needed to keep trade 
going. Paper money was used 
occasionally before ap 900, but 
it only really became common 
when merchants in the great 
trading city of Chengdu began 
to use it in the 10th century. 
Within 300 years, under the 
rule of the Mongol emperor 
Kublai Khan, China had 
practically replaced metal coins 
with paper money.

capital of Iraq) thought 
differently. Despite being

molding types from clay and

first clockwork clock was put 
in the Palais de Justice, Paris, 
by Henry De Vick in about 
1360. It had only one hand, 
and with errors of up to two 
hours a day was probably less 
accurate than Su Sung’s clock.

Early farmers just moved on

1100, European farmers began 
using a three-field system. They 
planted one-third of their land 
in the fall, another third in 
spring, and left the rest 
unplanted for a year to recover, 
rotating the use of the patches 
of land each year. In this way, 
the farmers got two harvests a 
year, and by planting a spring 
crop of peas or beans, which 


increase nitrogen in the soil, 
they increased the fertility of 
the land as well.

Arab scientist Alhazen fakes insanity to

hotography, modern telephones, 

and television are just a few of 
the inventions that depend on optics 
— the science of light. For hundreds 
of years, the subject was in confusion. 
Then, about 1,000 years ago, a “crazy” 
Arab scientist called Alhazen helped 
everyone to see things more clearly. 

The story is that Alhazen went to Cairo, 
Egypt’ fastest-growing city, to advise the 
notoriously cruel ruler al-Hakim on how to control — 
the flow of the all-important Nile River. But Alhazen’s 
City OF CAIRO ideas didn’t work, and the Nile flowed on as usual. He thought that

Like modern rulers, Cairo’s | 
al-Hakim relied on scientists for 
help with technical problems, such 
as controlling the waters of the 
Nile during its annual flood. 


Alhazen wrote all this down in a great book called 
Optics, which was translated into Latin and reached 
Europe in 1270. It may be a coincidence, but this was 
exactly when magnifying glasses 
and eyeglasses, the forerunners of 
microscopes and telescopes, began 
to appear in Europe. 

The feared al-Hakim 
eventually disappeared in 
mysterious circumstances one 
night in 1021. Alhazen, who was 
instantly restored to sanity, lived on 
for another 20 years. Brilliant though 
he was, he can never have imagined

Rudder 


t is thought that some early 
Chinese boats were steered 
with simple rudders, but until 

about AD 1200, most boats 
around the world were steered 
by sailors trailing oars over the 
side. The modern rudder 
arrived in stages. First, a large 
steering oar was attached near 
to the back, or stern, of the 
boat. In about 1200, it was 
moved right to the stern to 
become a simple rudder. 
By about 1300, a long 
steering lever, called 
the tiller, had been 
added to complete 
the rudder.

system, which was started in 
the 6th or 7th centuries in 
India, was taken up by Arab 
mathematicians in the 9th 
century and reached the West 
during the 10th century. It 
made little impact until 
Leonardo Pisano wrote Liber 
Abaci (Book of the Abacus) in 
1202. The book explained 
everything about Arabic 
numerals, from how to write 
them to the mysteries of 
hundreds, tens, and units. 
The new system made 
calculations much easier.

Buttonhole 


ou might think that 
buttons and buttonholes 
were invented together, but 
buttons actually came first. 
The ancient Greeks and 
Romans used buttons to fasten 
their clothes at the shoulder, 
but these went through loops, 
not holes. Buttonholes were 
invented in Europe in the 
13th century. They made 
buttons so popular that 
laws were passed to limit 
the number that people 
could have, to prevent rich 
people from having too many. 


Magnetic poles

rench engineer Petrus 

Peregrinus de Maricourt did 
the first known scientific 
experiment on a magnet. He 
put a sliver of iron in various 
places on a round lump of 
magnetic rock called lodestone, 
and marked the stone to show 
how the iron positioned itself 
each time. His lines converged 
at opposite sides of the stone. 
The marked stone looked like a 
globe with lines of longitude 
radiating from the north and 
south poles. He called these 
points the magnetic poles, a 
term that is still used today.

later. “Arrows of flying fire” 
were used when the Mongols 
besieged the Chinese city of 
Kai-feng in 1232, but these 
were probably just fireworks 
tied to arrows. Chinese soldiers 
are not thought to have begun 
using rockets as weapons until 
1300 at the earliest, but by 
1330, rockets were equipped 
with explosive warheads and 
were no longer toys. 


Shoe sizes 


he earliest system of 

standard shoe sizes may 
possibly date back to 1305, 
when King Edward I of 
England decided that the inch 
should be fixed at the length 
of three barleycorns. This made 
the official barleycorn one-third 
of an inch long. It has been 
said that children’s shoes then 
began to be based on this 
barleycorn measure. As a large 
child’s foot at that time was 
about 13 barleycorns (4.33 in/ 
11 cm) long, a shoe to fit it 
was called size 13.

uch of what doctors now 
LV know about the human 
body originally came from early 
examinations of the dead. An 
talian doctor, Mondino de’ 
Luzzi, did a lot of this, and 
often gave public lectures 

while he dissected corpses. 
Although he tended to see what 
his predecessor Galen (%* see

his 1316 book Anathomia 
Mundini was the first European

times that was based on 
observation of human bodies.

Cannon 


Le Chinese made cannons 
(large guns that stand on 
the ground) soon after they 
invented gunpowder (% see 
page 63), but because they 
were made only of bamboo 
they were really just oversized 
fireworks. Only cannon barrels 
made of bronze or iron were 
strong enough to withstand a 
powerful explosion. They were 
not made until about 1320, 
when techniques for casting 


and boring them were perfected. 


The new weapons were rushed 
into action all over Europe. By 
the 15th century, the cannon 
had grown into a monster that 
could fire balls weighing more 
than 55 lb (25 kg).

alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan had

design, but working out 
how smaller, portable weapons 
could be charged with powder, 
aimed, and fired proved more 
difficult. The earliest attempts, 
used in Europe from about 
1350, had no triggers and were 
held under the arm, making it 
impossible to aim them 
accurately. The first firearm that 
looked anything like a modern 
weapon was the harquebus. 
This didn’t reach the battlefield 
until about 1470, and it was 
useless against fast, accurate 
bows and arrows. 


Clavichord 


woodcut is a picture 

carved on a piece of fine- 
grained wood, which is then 
used for printing. Whole books 
were being printed from wood 
blocks in China by ab 600, but 
the woodcut has a different 
history. It began to be used in 
about 1400, especially for the 
production of playing cards. 
But it really came into its 
own after 1450, when 
printing from movable 
types had been perfected. 
Readers wanted to see the 
same kind of pictures they had 
always had in handwritten 
books, and the woodcut was 
there to provide them. 


he clavichord is a distant 

ancestor of the piano. 
The first reference to what 
was probably a clavichord 
isin a French ledger of gy 
about 1360, although the 
musical instrument did not 
get its modern name until 
later. The clavichord’s 
mechanism is very simple: 
when a key is pushed 
down, a thin metal blade 
strikes the string. The note 
sounds until the key is 
released, giving the player great 
control over the sound — a 
definite advantage for 
musicians who like to practice 


at night.

As the name suggests, the

1400, wooden bats had 
replaced hands, and a game 
resembling tennis emerged. In 
the 16th century, it was played 
indoors with rackets. Then, 
about 300 years later, a British 
army officer, Walter Wingfield, 
adapted the game to 
outdoors, creating 
“lawn” tennis as it 

is now known.

NEW IDEAS 


HUMAN UNDERSTANDING of the 
world grew enormously between 
1400 and 1750. Our planet ceased 
to be seen as the center of the 
universe, and seemed to grow as 
explorers reached new lands. 
New discoveries, and new means 
to communicate them, led to an 
age of reason and the beginnings 
of modern science. 


Metal 
movable type 


Htai Tjong 


pee in Korea started 
working on movable metal 
types in the 14th century, and 
in 1403, King Htai Tjong of 
Korea had the first true font of 
metal type made. One hundred 
thousand bronze characters 
were cast, and that was just the 
start. The king had two more 
complete fonts ready long 
before movable type was 
perfected in Germany (* see 
pages 75 and 76-77). 


Water-powered 
iron works 


Walter Skirlaw 


edieval ironworkers 

heated iron ore with 
charcoal in a furnace to 
produce a spongy lump of iron 
called a bloom. The hotter the 
fire was, the better the furnace 
worked, so air was pumped in 
with bellows to feed the flames. 
As demand for iron grew and 
furnaces got larger, something 
more than muscle power was 
needed to work the bellows. In 
England, which would become 
the largest iron producer in the 
world, the problem was tackled 
by Walter Skirlaw, the Bishop 
of Durham. He set up a water- 
powered bloomery in 1408.

Code breaking 


al-Kalka-shandi 


arly attempts at secret 

writing were not effective, 
but by the late 14th century 
Arab code writers and breakers, 
called cryptographers, were 
getting serious. They invented 
systems for changing each letter 
into a different one, and used 
the fact that some letters occur 
more often than others to 
decipher supposedly secret 
messages. These tricks of the 
trade were published in 1412 
by Egyptian scholar al-Kalka- 
shandi, forming the first 
reliable set of instructions for 
code makers and breakers. 


Perspective 


Filippo Brunelleschi, 
Leon Alberti 


he Italian architect and 

artist Filippo Brunelleschi 
discovered linear perspective — 
the art of drawing objects in a 
way that gives an impression of 
their size and relative position 
— between 1410 and 1415. The 
discovery revolutionized the 
way artists drew pictures. Until 
he discovered the “vanishing 
point,” to which all parallel 
lines converge, pictures were 
built up from flat shapes. 
Twenty years later, his friend 
Leon Alberti wrote a book 
giving detailed instructions on 
how to create the correct 
perspective. This enabled 
painters to produce 
pictures with a realism 
that was unsurpassed 
until 19th-century 
photography.

windmills is 
that the wind

box mounted on a 
pivot, so it was 
difficult to swing the 
sails into the wind. 
The tower mill, 
invented in about 
1420, had all its 
heavy machinery 
in a fixed 
tower.

of flywheel action,

Robert Campin,

Ithough the Romans knew 

about oil paint, it was the 
French and Flemish painters 
Robert Campin and Jan van 
Eyck who perfected its use in 
art. Both were attracted by the 
realism that oil paint allowed. 
Earlier paints, such as tempera, 
which was made with eggs, 
couldn't produce the same 
smoothly graded tones. Using 
the new paint and the new 
laws of perspective (* see 
page 73), van Eyck painted 
pictures with a realism never 
seen before.

Leon Alberti realized that 
he could apply the same laws 


to a miniature scene to

The peep show was a

end. Inside was a three- 
dimensional scene 
modeled in perspective. 
When the model was 
viewed through the 
hole, it leapt to life 
with startling realism. 
Alberti made his first 
peep shows in 1437. 
He even painted the 
scenery on glass to allow 
for lighting effects. 


Harpsichord 


he harpsichord was king 

of the keyboards from 
about 1500 until well after the 
piano was invented in 1709 


( see page 100). 
Unlike the piano, 
its strings are 
plucked, not 
struck with 
hammers, as the 
keys are pressed. 
Because of this, it 
is not possible to 
vary the loudness 
of a note by 

striking the key 

with more or less 
force. Some harpsichords have 
several sets of strings so that 
pieces of music can be played 
at different volumes. The 
instrument was first described 
in about 1450. It spread 
rapidly throughout Europe 
and is still played today.

“wind”). The

1850, but the

400 years earlier. 
Italian artist and 
mathematician 
Leon Alberti’s 
instrument 
was much simpler — just a 
rectangular metal plate, hinged 
at the top. When the wind 
blew, the plate tilted, giving a 
rough indication of the speed. 
Alberti described it in about 
1450 in his book The Pleasures 
of Mathematics. As British 
scientist Robert Hooke was 
reinventing a more accurate 
form of anemometer, Mayans 
were building “windtowers.” 


Trombone 


Of called the 
sackbut, the trombone 


was invented in France in 
about 1450. It is basically 

a tube that produces sound 
from vibration of the lips. The 
simplest instruments of this 
type can play only a few notes 
because their length is fixed. A 
trombone can play a full range 
of notes because its length can 
be changed with tubes that 
slide in and out. The modern 
trombone has not changed 
much since the original 
instrument was designed 
more than 550 years ago.

oodcuts, made in Europe 

from about 1400 (* see 
page 71), could not produce 
as finely detailed pictures, but 
metal plates could. An artist 
engraved the required lines on 
the plate, usually made of 
copper, with a sharp tool called 
a graver. The plate was then 
covered with greasy ink and 
the surface wiped clean again, 
leaving ink only in the 
engraved lines. When damp 
paper was pressed hard onto 
the plate, it picked up the 
ink from the lines, forming a 
print. This process, known 
as intaglio, was first used in 
about 1455. It required more 
pressure than normal printing, 
so printers still used woodcuts 
in books containing text 
printed with type.

must have helped him to perfect 
the metal types he needed.

In the German city

jeweller called Johann 
Gutenberg was acting very 
strangely. He was borrowing 
money from his friends to buy 
materials that had nothing to do 
with jewelry. He wouldn't say 
why he needed them, or why they cost so much. 
In the end, his friends refused to lend him any more 
money until he came clean. His secret astonished them. He 
was working on an invention that would allow books to be 
mass-produced instead of copied out by hand.

control of everything. Pausing only to steal 
Gutenberg’s best assistant, he set himself up as 
the world’s first successful printer. 

Fust didn’t keep his lead for long. Within 
25 years, there were printers all over Europe. 

By 1500 they had printed 30,000 books, 
spreading new ideas far and wide and helping 
to launch the age we call the Renaissance. 

And Johann Gutenberg? He kept on printing, 
but didn’t make much money. The Archbishop of 
Mainz gave him food and clothing, but by 1468, 
Gutenberg was dead. The future he had helped 
to create was on its way without him.

_EUROPE’S NEW WORLD” 


AMERICA WAS NEW ONLY to Columbus and other 
non-Americans. Both the north and south of the 
continent were inhabited by people who had 
lived there for thousands of years and built 
advanced cultures of their own. Once the New 
World was discovered, other people flooded in, 
creating new colonies. Some of these became 
the United States of America, which within a 
few centuries would dominate the world’s science, 
technology, and industry.

Before Columbus sailed west, the entire world known to

COLUMBUS’ BIG IDEA 

Trade with the East was important in the 15th century, 

but getting there was difficult. Columbus thought he could 
reach the East by sailing west. Expert sailors told him he 
was wrong, but failed to stop him from attempting it.

done in two steps: first the five- 
line stave, then the notes. By 
1525, French printer Pierre 
Attaignant had invented a 
better system. Each note 
carried a bit of stave, so lines 
and notes were printed 
together. Within ten years, 
Attaignant was printing music 
by every leading composer.

Fluorspar 


Georgius Bauer 


Ke well as being a beautiful 
crystal, fluorspar, or 
fluorite, is important in making 
steel and aluminum. It is a 
compound of calcium and 
fluorine, often found 
near hot springs. 
The German 
scholar and 
scientist Georgius 
Bauer, usually 
known as Agricola, 
described it first 

in 1529. He 
regarded it as a 
fossil, the term 
that scientists used 
then for anything 
found in the earth.

physician Andreas Vesalius 
took a fresh look at human 
anatomy. From his own 
dissections, he discovered that 
Galen had based his work on 
animals, not humans. In 1543, 
Vesalius produced a book 
describing human anatomy in 
detail. It showed what could be 
done by daring to dissect.

most scientists in Britain, 
France, Denmark, and the 
Netherlands agreed with

Roman Catholic Church finally 
allowed its members to read

an Earth year is 365.242 
days, not 365.25 as 
Caesar had assumed. 
Pope Gregory XIII 
sorted things out once 

and for all. First he 

chopped out 10 days to 
reset the calendar. Then, 
by decreeing that one 
leap year should disappear 
in three out of every four 
centuries, he corrected the 
error, creating the calendar we

notice this in about 1583, 
supposedly while watching a 
lamp swinging in Pisa cathedral 
during a boring service. The 
problem of accurate time- 
keeping was solved in principle, 
but a practical pendulum clock 
was not available until 
Christiaan Huygens of the 
Netherlands built one in 1657 
( see page 92).

MAGNETIC PLANET 


WILLIAM GILBERT BELIEVED that the 
Earth contained a huge bar magnet, but 
in reality its core is too hot to allow this. 
The modern theory is that electric currents 
circulating in its liquid iron core create the 
magnetic field. However this field arises, 
navigators have been using it for 
centuries whenever they use a 
magnetic compass to guide 
them. We now know that its 
influence extends far 
beyond Earth. 


William 
Gilbert 
(1544- 
1603) 


THE MAGNETIC COMPASS 
The principle of the 
compass may first have 
been used by the Chinese 
for land exploration 

and in their feng shui 
philosophy for checking 
the orientation of 
buildings. The difference 
between magnetic and geographic north was known by 1050, 


and compasses with iron needles floating on water were in use 


at sea by the 12th century. 


Early sailors would have been familiar with the northern lights 
- eerie, dancing curtains of light that sometimes appear in the 
night sky of the far north and south. But they would not have 
connected them with the behavior of their compasses. In fact,

His book on the magnet took

Gilbert concluded that compass 
needles point north because 
Earth itself is a giant magnet 
whose north and south poles 
roughly coincide with its 
geographic poles. In an age 
without Newton’s theory of 
gravity (* see pages 98-99), 
Gilbert was not the only

NAMING OF STARS Before Bayer 
published Uranometria, there was 
no systematic way of naming the 
stars. The book’s ornate title page is 
typical of the period. 


Naming of stars 


Johann Bayer 


housands of stars can be 

seen without a telescope, so 
astronomers need a system for 
naming them all. The standard 
way is to label the stars in each 
constellation with Greek letters: 
our nearest star (actually three 
stars close together) is called 
alpha Centauri because it is the 
brightest star in the Centaurus 
constellation and alpha is the 
first letter of the Greek 
alphabet. This system was 
invented by German lawyer 
Johann Bayer for a guide to the 
stars, Uranometria, which was 
published in 1603. It was the 
first really accurate star atlas. 
Where there were more visible 
stars than letters in the Greek 
alphabet, Bayer continued with 
Latin characters. His system has 
since been extended to cover 
about 1,300 stars.

wrong way. In 1603, the Italian 
surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius 
ab Aquapendente published 
details of the valves that he had 
discovered in human veins. He 
didn’t quite understand why 
they were there, but his 
observation helped William

but it was a German 
astronomer, Johannes Kepler, 
who produced a coherent 
theory of light rays in 1604. 


Telescope 


Hans Lippershey 


- 1608, Dutch spectacle 
maker Hans Lippershey 
discovered that if you look 
through the right pair of lenses, 
distant objects appear bigger. 
Possibly the first to invent the 
telescope, he may also have 
invented a microscope, which, 
like the telescope, involves 
looking through two lenses. He 
offered his telescope, or 
“looker,” as he called it, to the 
government, but they said they 
would prefer binoculars. 
However, within a year, the 
Italian scientist Galileo had 
recognized the importance of 
the telescope and was using his 
own to make startling 
discoveries about our galaxy.

making telescopes, and 
eventually built one that made 
objects look 20 times bigger. 
In January 1610, he trained it 
on Jupiter and saw the planet’s 
four largest moons. He 
published this observation, 
and much else revealed by the 
telescope, in a book called The 
Starry Messenger. The moons 
were named — Io, Europa, 
Ganymede, and Callisto — by 
the German astronomer Simon 
Marius.

Maths for fun

Ce of the first and most 
successful puzzle makers 
was the French mathematician 
Claude-Gaspar de Méziriac, 
with his 1612 book Pleasing 
and Delightful Number Problems. 
As well as the usual brain- 
teasers involving weighing 
things with strange sets of 
weights and getting awkward 
combinations of objects across 
rivers, it included a number of 
intriguing card tricks. Its last 
reprint was in 1959.

used a trigger mechanism to set 
off the powder, allowing a 
soldier to hold the weapon 
with both hands and aim it 
accurately. The best of them 
was the flintlock musket. 
The first true flintlock may 
have been made by a French 
gun maker called Marin de 
Bourgeoys for Louis XIII of 
France, in about 1612. Its 


trigger released a spring-loaded

readers and included a list of 
words and where to find them.

the early 17th century,

theory that the planets orbited 
the Sun at a constant speed and 
in perfect circles. Then the 
astronomer Johannes Kepler 
showed that they didn’t. Using 
the excellent data gathered by 
his former employer Tycho 
Brahe, he calculated that the 
planets’ paths were ovals, or 
ellipses, not circles, and that 
their speed was not constant. 
The universe was turning out 
to be more complicated than 
people thought.

Francis Bacon 


he English statesman and 

philosopher Francis Bacon 
believed that people could 
learn more about nature by 
observing things and thinking 
about them than by reading 


books and making hasty 
judgments. In 1620, he 
published details of a revealing 
observation he had made: a 
candle flame has a distinct 
structure, with a dark center 
and a bright edge. This simple 
fact eventually helped scientists 
to understand combustion. 
Bacon’s way of thinking about 
observations has become a key 
method of science.

direction. Once people knew 
the law, scientists eventually 
began to use it to design more 
effective lenses. Later, French 
mathematician Pierre de Fermat 
showed that Snell’s law 
amounted to saying that light

Pierre Vernier 


Rav from a graduated 
scale can be inaccurate 
because the position of a 
pointer has to be estimated by 
eye. In 1631, French civil 
servant Pierre Vernier invented 
an improved scale, which is 
still used today. Instead of a 
simple pointer, it has a second 
smaller scale with slightly 
narrower divisions than the 
main scale. By noting which of 
these lines up exactly with the 
main scale, its user can obtain a 
much more precise readout. 


Slide rule 


William Oughtred 


n English minister, William 

Oughtred, turned math 
into mechanics in 1633 by 
making two scales showing the 
logarithms of numbers (%* see

multiply and divide 
by sliding the 
scales to a 
certain position 
and reading off 
the answer.

something stops it. Objects 
in the real world slow down 
and stop because of friction 
or gravity. Galileo did 
further experiments that 
proved that a falling object 
speeds up as it falls. He 
went on to study projectiles 
— objects that are thrown 
into the air. He deduced that 
a projectile moves forward 
at a constant speed but 
accelerates downward. It 
therefore follows a curved 
path called a parabola. 


Transit of

Jeremiah Horrocks 


“transit” of Mercury or 

Venus occurs when one of 
them appears to travel across 
the face of the Sun. Transits of 
Venus happen only in June or 
December, and always in pairs 
eight years apart. They are very 
rare, the pairs occurring at 
intervals of well over a century. 
English clergyman Jeremiah 
Horrocks was an amateur 
astronomer, Using standard 
astronomical tables, he 
calculated that there would be 
a transit of Venus in December 
1639, the first ever recorded. 
He also calculated a new 
distance for the Sun.

that he also discovered

bowls, put them together

mathematician Christiaan 
Huygens solved the problem in 
1657 when he designed a 
mechanism that allowed the 
swing of a pendulum to control 
the rotation of weight-driven 
gearwheels. He also devised a 
pendulum that would swing at 
exactly the same rate whatever 
the size of its swing. The 
pendulum improved the 
accuracy of timekeeping so 
much that it was at last worth 
giving clocks a minute hand.

did blood get from arteries to 
veins? Marcello Malpighi, 
working in Bologna, Italy, in 
1661, found the answer. The 
blood travelled through tiny 
vessels, which were visible only 
under a microscope: capillaries. 


Level 


Az affected by gravity 
can be used to check 


whether something is level. 
The best thing is a bubble in a 
liquid, which always rises to 
the highest point. In a slightly 
curved-shape tube, this is in 
the center when the tube is 
level. If the tube is mounted 
in a suitable holder, the user 
only has to place it on an 
object and center the bubble 

to ensure the object is level. 
This gadget, the level, first 
appeared in 1661, and builders 
still use levels today. 


Boyle’s law 


Robert Boyle, 
Edmé Mariotte 


Teens Boyle worked with 
the English physicist Robert 
Hooke, who helped him to 
build an effective air pump. 
Boyle used the new pump to 
make all sorts of discoveries 
about air, but the one 
everybody remembers is Boyle’s 
law. This says that the volume 
of a given mass of gas varies 
inversely with its pressure, 
which means that the gas will 


contract if the pressure is 
raised and vice versa. In 
France, this principle is called 
Mariotte’s law, because Edmé 
Mariotte not only discovered it 
for himself but also noted that 
the law does not hold if the 
temperature changes. 


Life table 


John Graunt 


Pps who study 
population are known as 


demographers. They use 
statistics, such as how many 
people live in an area and how 
many births and deaths per 
thousand. English shopkeeper 
John Graunt founded the 
subject by studying death 
records. In 1662, he published 
tables showing the probability 
that someone of a given age 
would live to some greater age. 
“Life tables” like these are now 
the basis of life insurance. 


Reflecting

lenses to refract light from

telescope that used mirrors 
promised clearer vision. Italian 
astronomer Niccolo Zucchi 
suggested this in 1616, but the

“WORKING IN A VACUUM 


THE ANCIENT PHYSICS OF ARISTOTLE said that a 
vacuum was impossible. In the 17th century, 


improved technology 
could challenge this 
directly. Once Guericke 
had demonstrated an 
effective air pump, other 
people, such as Irish 


chemist Robert Boyle, built 
them too. With the ability 
to move air around at will, 


they began to find out 
more about combustion, 
sound, weather, and 
much else.

MAKING A VACUUM 

Simple pumps use pistons to 
suck out air. Oneway valves 
stop it from rushing back in. 
Because a piston sucks out only 
a fraction of the remaining air 
on each stroke, the vacuum is 
never perfect, even if the valves 
and seals don’t leak. This did 
not put off early experimenters. 


THE SCIENCE OF AIR 
With air under control, 
scientists like Guericke, Boyle, 
and Edmé Mariotte could 
find out some facts about it. 
For example, without air, 
candles don’t burn and 
there is no sound; and 
reducing the pressure of 
moist air makes clouds 
form. Mariotte and 
Boyle also discovered 
the law that links air

He spent it making ever better 
lenses with which he could see 
ever smaller things. In 1674, he 
became the first person to see 
protozoa — tiny, single-celled 
creatures that swim around in 
ponds and rain barrels. His 
descriptions of the hidden 
world around us made a big 
impact on science. 


Speed of light

long way. Danish astronomer 
Ole Romer found this out by 
accident in 1676, when he 
noticed that the time between 
eclipses of Jupiter's moons 
(when they are hidden behind 
the planet) varied throughout 
the year. Romer realized that 
this must be because the 
distance from Earth to Jupiter 
varied throughout the year, 
and so did the distance that 
light from the moons had to 
travel. Romer calculated that 
the speed of light was 
137,000 miles (225,000 km) 
per second. This was 25 percent 
too slow, but a good start.

Newton in England. Newton 
created a special method to 
solve problems in mechanics.

Newton formulated three 
laws of motion, which he

that the velocity of an object 
(its speed and direction) will 
change only if a force acts on it. 
This was discovered by Galileo, 
but the other two laws are all 
Newton. The second says how

could explain why light obeyed 
it. Christiaan Huygens proposed 
the first theory that light was a 
stream of waves. These waves 
made secondary “wavelets” 
when passed through an object. 
When light hit glass at an angle, 
the “wavelets” produced slowed 
down, making the light bend. 
In conflict with Newton’s ideas, 
it was not seriously considered 
until the 19th century.

developed from an earlier 
musical instrument, the 
chalumeau, by the German 
musician and instrument maker 
Johann Denner, in about 1700. 
To extend the range of the 
chalumeau, Denner added 


three extra keys to bridge the 
awkward gap between the 
instrument's lower and upper 
registers. The lower register of 
a clarinet is still sometimes 
called the chalumeau.

In about 1700, German

this theory is that things get 
heavier when they burn, so 
phlogiston would have to 
weigh less than nothing. By 
1783, French chemist Antoine

Lavoisier had substituted gain 
of oxygen for loss of 
phlogiston, which is the true

THE MOON IS FALLING 


Isaac Newton discovers the glue that 
holds the universe together 


hen Isaac Newton was only three years old, 
his father died and his mother married 
again. She went to live in the next village, 
leaving him with his grandmother. Isaac was 
not happy. He often sat in the orchard behind 
his home, Woolsthorpe Manor in 
Lincolnshire, England, smoldering with 
hatred for his new stepfather. In 1653, when 
Isaac was 10, his mother came back. She

University. There was so much to read. 

The official teaching was old-fashioned, 
but Newton taught himself the new science 
of Galileo, Descartes, and others. “Plato is 
my friend, Aristotle is my friend,” he wrote 
in his notebook, “but my best friend is truth.” 

No sooner had he received his degree, in 
1665, than the Plague came, which forced everyone to leave Cambridge. 
Newton returned to Woolsthorpe. The orchard was still there, and 
Newton still went to sit there, his mind now full of scientific questions. 
One of them was “What keeps the planets in their orbits?” A famous story 
tells us that as Newton pondered this among the old trees, with heavenly 
bodies like the Moon uppermost in his thoughts, an apple fell. It took a 
genius like Newton to see the connection. The Moon kept circling Earth 
because, like the apple, it was falling. Gravity made the Moon curve 
toward Earth instead of continuing in a straight line. And what worked for 
the Moon could work for the planets circling the Sun. 

Newton was able to show that the force of gravity got weaker 
in proportion to the square of distance. In other words, 
a planet twice as far from the Sun as 
another will experience only one 

quarter of the force; if it is three 
times as far away, the force will 
be one ninth, and so on. 
Other people had suggested 
this, but Newton went further. 
Using powerful new math he’d 
invented, together with his laws of 
~ motion, he proved that gravity 

could account for the orbits of all 

the planets. It was the glue that held the 
universe together. 

In 1687, Newton published his book 
Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, usually 
known as the Principia, a shortened form of its Latin 
title. In it he explained his three basic laws, which govern 

the way objects move, and his theory of gravity and the universe. But 
his personal universe was not so well ordered. Just before publication, 
another scientist, Robert Hooke, accused him of copying his ideas. 
Newton never forgave him. Just as he hated the man who stole his 
mother, he now despised the rival who was trying to steal his glory.

1 before Newton’s time, it 
was generally known that

However, most people believed 
that it was due to some change 
the prism made on light — like 
clay being pressed through a 
mold. To disprove this notion,

actually made up of many 
colors by using a second prism 
to recombine light back into 
white. Although he made this 
discovery in 1670, he waited 
until 1704 to publish his 
findings in his book Opticks.

Bernoulli effect

wiss scientist Daniel 

Bernoulli figured out that 
if a stream of fluid (a gas or 
liquid) speeds up, its pressure 
drops. This “Bernoulli effect” 
can be seen in a popular 
science exhibit — a ball 
suspended on a stream of air 
from a blower. The air coming 
out of the blower is moving 
faster than the air that went in, 
so its pressure is lower than the 
surrounding air. If the ball 
moves from the air stream, the 
higher pressure pushes it back.

He was the first to make steel 
hot enough to melt, allowing it 
to form a perfectly even alloy.

Sheffield famous for fine steel.

have been the thinking behind 
German physicist Ewald von 
Kleist’s invention of the Leyden

Jesse Ramsden 


Fema measurements 
require accurately made 
measuring tools. Before British 
instrument maker Jesse 
Ramsden perfected his dividing 
engine in 1766, angles on 
theodolites and other 
instruments were made by 
hand by craftsmen and could 
be somewhat hit-or-miss. The 
dividing engine produced 
scales for scientific instruments 
mechanically. It was faster and 
more accurate than craftsmen, 
and meant that maps, as well 
as astronomical and 
navigational measurements, 
were more reliable. 


Hydrogen 


Henry Cavendish 


ritish scientist Henry 

Cavendish was the first 
person to show that hydrogen 
was a distinct gas, not just a 
sort of air. He released 
hydrogen from sulfuric acid by 
dissolving metal in it, then 
measured its density. He found 
that it was lighter than any 
other gas. Later, he confirmed 
that hydrogen forms water 
when it burns. This led French 
chemist Lavoisier to call it 
hydrogen, from the Greek for 
“water maker”, 


Improved 
steam engine 


James Watt 


he first steam engines were 

built to pump water out of 
coal mines. It was lucky there 
was plenty of coal, because the 
engines wasted a lot of fuel. 
James Watt discovered how to 


reduce the waste, allowing 
steam engines to compete with 
waterwheels in powering the 
new factories. He also invented 
better ways of controlling steam 
engines and connecting them 
to other machines. (%* See also 
The story of steam.) 


Steam tractor 


Nicolas Cugnot 


arly steam engines were 

huge, heavy, and 
underpowered, but by 1769 
they were good enough for 


Nicolas Cugnot, a French 
army engineer, to build a three- 
wheeled steam tractor. The 
following year, he built a 
bigger one to pull heavy guns. 
Its single front wheel, which 
was used for steering, was 
driven by a two-cylinder 
high-pressure steam engine. 
Although the later machine 
successfully pulled a three-ton 
cannon at walking speed, 
Cugnot never got the money 
he needed to solve its 
problems, such as how it 
could carry enough water to 
keep the engine going, and 
how to stop the high-pressure 
steam from leaking out. 


THE STORY OF STEAM 


THOMAS SAVERY’S STEAM ENGINE, which he patented in 1698, simply 
sucked up water with the vacuum created when steam condenses. Thomas 
Newcomen’s engine, built in 1712, had a piston and could operate a 


mechanical pump, but wasted fuel 
because its cylinder had to be 
warmed up from cold after every 
stroke. James Watt added a 
separate cooling chamber, 
allowing the main cylinder to stay 


hot all the time. 


SAVERY’S ENGINE 


Steam entered a chamber, forcing water out 
through a valve. The steam was then 
cooled, creating a vacuum that sucked 
water in through another valve, ready to be 
forced out during the next cycle. 


NEWCOMEN’S ENGINE 


Steam entered a cylinder, causing a piston 
to move upwards. The steam was then 

cooled, creating a vacuum that allowed the 
atmosphere to push the piston down. This 
operated a pump through a rocking beam. 


WATT’S ENGINES 


Having added a separate cooling chamber, 
Watt further improved Newcomen’s engine 
by letting steam push the piston down as 
well as up, and adding gears that allowed 
the engine to drive rotating machinery.

that his water-powered 
spinning machine (%* see page

would have to gather where 
there was a waterwheel. In 
about 1770, in partnership 
with two local stocking makers, 
Samuel Need and Jedediah 
Strutt, he opened a water- 
powered mill at Cromford in 
Derbyshire, England. This was 
the first real factory, and marked 
the start of the industrial age.

Meanwhile, British chemist 
Joseph Priestley discovered a 
gas in which things burned 
fast. Believing that burning 
things gave out “phlogiston” 
(* see page 97), he called it 
“dephlogisticated air”. But the 
French chemist Antoine 
Lavoisier proved that the gas 
combined with burning 
substances rather than sucking 


phlogiston out. Lavoisier’s new 
name for it, oxygen, means 
“acid maker”, which it isn’t.

The second way is quicker

Adam Smith. He saw its extra 
productivity as the true source

invented his “puddling” 
process in 1784, the only 
way to produce flexible, or 
wrought, iron was to hammer 
freshly smelted iron while it 
was still hot, squeezing out 
carbon. Cort melted iron with 
iron oxide to form a puddle, 
then stirred it while hot gases 
burned off the carbon. The 
purer metal gathered into a 
large ball that, with just a 
little hammering, became 
wrought iron. 


Edmund 
Cartwright 


he designer 
of the first 
power loom, 
Edmund Cartwright, was 
a British country parson, 
He was, in his own 
words, “totally ignorant of 
the subject, having never 
at that time seen a person 
weave”. He realized, 
though, that cheap yarn 
from powered spinning 
machines could 
transform cloth making. 
His first loom, built in 1785, 
was very crude, but by 
1787 he had improved it 
enough to start a weaving 
factory in Doncaster. The 
government later awarded him 
£10,000 in recognition of his 
pioneering work. (%* See also 
Weaving a new world.) 


WEAVING A NEW WORLD 


BETWEEN ABOUT 1750 AND 1850, in a process known as the Industrial 
Revolution, Britain transformed itself from a largely agricultural nation into the 
world’s leading industrial power. The industry that led the way was cloth 
making. Attracted by higher wages, workers moved from farms into the new 
factories. These were made possible by water power, steam power, new 
machines, and more adventurous ways of raising money. 


1751 - 1850 


This 1834 drawing of a Lancashire cotton mill cannot convey the deafening noise of the many power looms. 


SPEEDING UP SPINNING 
Until about 1770, spinning 
was a cottage industry. 
Merchants delivered raw wool 
and picked up finished yarn 
made at home. This changed 
when powered machines 
forced spinners to work in 

a factory, or starve.

readily in divine intervention.

Humphry Davy 


y 1807, British chemist 

Humphry Davy had 
demonstrated a sensational 
effect to an audience at the 
Royal Institution of Great 
Britain. He brought together 
two carbon rods connected to 
a colossal 3000-volt battery, 
then drew them apart to 
produce a blinding white 
flame 4 in (10 cm) long. It was 
another 70 years before electric 
generators were good enough 
to turn this bold experiment 
into practical lighting for streets 
and warehouses.

are never found uncombined.

modern chemistry. In his New 
System of Chemical Philosophy he 
said that chemical elements 
consist of atoms, each element 
having atoms of a different 
weight. The ratios of these 
weights, and the proportions in 
which atoms combined, were 
whole numbers. Ignored for 
nearly 50 years, Dalton’s work 
eventually had a great effect.

MAKING THE MAGIC LAMP 


Humphry Davy and George Stephenson 
fight to save miners’ lives 


fit heroes May 25, 1812, was a terrible day for the mining 
village of Felling, near Newcastle, England. A massive 
underground explosion killed 92 miners, some of them only 
10 years old. It was one of a series of disasters caused by the flame in

burned, but the metal around the 
holes cooled the flame, preventing 
explosions. Stephenson's lamp was 
tested in October 1815, and it worked. 

Back in London, Davy experimented 
with firedamp from a mine. Like 
Stephenson, he fed in air through small 
holes, but he realized that the holes had 

to be very small indeed. His lamp had 

copper gauze around the flame. It was 

tested in January 1816, and was a 
success. The mine owners held a 
celebration dinner and gave Davy 
some silverware worth 50 times a 
miner's yearly pay. 

The miners were not impressed. They 
resented a southerner getting credit for 
something one of their own people had 
already invented. Many wouldn't use 


THE COMPETITORS 
Humphry Davy and 
George Stephenson

people. Davy, born 

in the southwest 
of England, was 
a well educated 
gentleman and a 
skilled scientist.

came from the

120 


1751 - 1850 


Stephenson had stolen the idea from him and that ; 
the geordie wouldn't work because it wasn’t scientific. ; 

In the end, most miners’ lamps incorporated ideas from 
all three inventors. They had glass instead of gauze around 
the flame, so they gave more light than Davy’s lamp, but 
the air was still fed in through gauze to prevent 
explosions. The problem was solved. 

Or was it? Unfortunately, the new lamps encouraged 
mine owners to send miners into areas that were 
previously thought too dangerous. And because the 
lamps weren't totally safe, there were just as many 
deaths as before. Davy and Stephenson may have 
fought each other for nothing. 


SAFETY LAMPS 

Davy’s lamp (right) and 
Stephenson's lamp (left) were 
the first safety lamps to be used 
coal mines, but the Marsaut 
mp of the 1880s (center) was 
of the safest, and saw many 
of successful series 


The industrial world of the 19th century was 
powered by coal. The safety lamp, which ate 
made it possible to work in dangerous areas, helped coal 
owners to get a lot more coal out of their mines. 


CONTINUING TRAGEDY 
Explosions like this one in 
1866 at Barnsley, England, 
were still killing miners 50 
years after the invention of 
the safety lamp.

to the current in the wire, 
showing that electricity could 
create magnetism. The two 
subjects were really one.

Greenhouse 
effect 


Joseph Fourier 


he greenhouse effect is in 

the news as cars and power 
stations pump carbon dioxide 
into the atmosphere. Natural 
greenhouse effects would 
keep the Earth at a comfortable 
temperature, but the polluting 
gases produced by humans trap 
too much heat and make the 
Earth warmer. The existence of 
the effect, and its similarity to 
how a greenhouse works, were 
first suggested by the French 
mathematician Joseph Fourier 
in 1827. He didn’t know how 
much people would worry 
about it 175 years later. 


Match 


John Walker 


A chemical knowledge 
increased, inventors began 
to apply it in the search for a 
better light. A few burned 
their fingers with creations 
like chemical-tipped wood 
dipped in sulfuric acid, then, in 
1827, British chemist John 
Walker produced the first 
practical match. His “friction 
lights” lit up when rubbed on 
sandpaper, just like 
some matches 
today. 


MATCH 
Early matches lit as 
soon as they were warmed by 


friction, so were supplied in a fireproof 


box in case they lit by accident. 
Modern matches are safer to carry. 


Macadamized 
road 


John McAdam 


cottish engineer John 

McAdam realized that the 
best base for a road was dry 
soil. In 1827, he started 
building roads made from 
compacted soil with stones on 
top. Iron-tired cartwheels broke 
the stones into smaller pieces, 
which filled any gaps and made 
the surface waterproof. 
“Macadamized” roads were 
used everywhere until cars, 
whose pneumatic tires 
damaged them by sucking out 
the smallest stones, demanded 
a road surface made with tar or 
bitumen. 


Multiple fire

he first steam boilers were 

tanks on top of a fire. This 
was inefficient because little of 
the water was in contact with 
the fire. In 1827, French 
engineer Marc Séguin invented 
a boiler with tubes going 
through the water, and hot 
gases from a fire going through 
the tubes. It heated water 
quickly and wasted less

the same idea in Rocket, the 
first locomotive to run on an 
all-steam railroad. 


Ohm’s law 


Georg Ohm 


hm’ law is 

fundamental to 
electrical and 
electronic 
engineering. 


It says that electric current 
= voltage + resistance. So 
when you connect a wire 
across a battery, if you 
double the length of the wire, 
and therefore the resistance, 
you will halve the current. 
George Ohm’s scientific 
colleagues in Germany 
thought that the law was 
nonsense when he published 
it in 1827, but Ohm had the 
last laugh. In 1841, the Royal 
Society in London gave him 
a medal, and his name lives 
on as the unit of resistance. 


Water turbine 


Claude Burdin, 
Benoit Fourneyron 


rench engineer Claude 
Burdin coined the word 
“turbine” from the Latin 
turbo, meaning 
“spinning top.” One 
of his students at the 
St Etienne Technical 
School, Benoit 
Fourneyron, built a 
working water 
turbine in 1827. 


Water fell on to a horizontal 
rotor and rushed through 
curved blades, making the 
rotor spin and producing as 
much power as six horses. He 
was soon building turbines that 
spun at 2,000 rpm (revolutions 
per minute) to produce 40 kW 
of power — ideal for generating 
electricity. In 1895, Fourneyron 
turbines were installed for this 
purpose at Niagara Falls on the 
Canada/US border.

is shown clearly when a wire 
is coiled up to create a stronger 
magnetic field. Joseph Henry 
discovered it when he

current carried on through the 
air instead of stopping.

Morse’s telegraph needed only one wire, 
which made it easy to construct. To make 
the single wire work, Morse and Vail 
invented a code based on patterns of 
pulses — an idea now used for all 

kinds of telecommunications.

soon after

twice for two, and so on. It was terribly slow, even with an 
automatic switch and a better code that used short and long 
bursts of current — “dots” and “dashes.” His homemade 
telegraph proved to be unreliable, too. 

That might have been the end of it, but in 1837, at an 
unsuccessful demonstration of the telegraph in New York, 
Morse met the young engineer Alfred Vail. Vail took one look 
at Morse’s amateurish efforts and offered to redesign the whole 
thing. He strengthened the electromagnet and replaced Morse’s 
complicated switch with a simple, hand-operated key. He threw out 
Morse’s word list and devised a dot-and-dash code for each letter of the 
alphabet. The telegraph was beginning to take shape. 

In 1843, after several successful 
demonstrations and some political 
wrangling, the US government gave 
Morse $30,000 to build a telegraph 
line between Baltimore and 
Washington, DC. There were 
quite a few technical 
problems, because nobody 
had ever laid 40 miles 
(65 kilometers) of wire before. But 
by May 24, 1844, everything was ready. 

With Vail in Baltimore tending a stack of 
batteries, and Morse in Washington looking after the Shisrecche™ 
politicians, the new line delivered its first message: embossed dots

Steam hammer 


James Nasmyth 


n 1839, British engineer 
Isambard Kingdom Brunel 
started work on his ship Great 
Britain. He soon discovered that 
hammering out the giant shafts 

for its paddlewheels was 
beyond human ability. Scottish 
engineer James Nasmyth came 
up with the idea of a steam 
hammer and designed one that 
would hit harder than a whole 
gang of people. He made the 
first one in 1840 and patented

Brunel had changed his mind 
about his ship, deciding to use 
the more modern propellers 
instead of paddlewheels. 


Dinosaurs

eople had been finding 

fossilized dinosaur bones all 
over the place, but they didn’t 
know what they were. Then 
British surgeon Richard Owen 
recognized that they belonged 
to an extinct group of reptiles 
unlike any now living. He 
named them “Dinosauria,” 
meaning “terrible lizards,” in 
1841. Owen later became 
famous for opposing Darwin’s 
theory of evolution and for 
getting the details of the earliest 
fossil bird completely wrong.

stretch out. This happens 

with light too, so astronomers 
can tell how fast stars are 
approaching or receding. With

Conservation of 
energy 


Julius von Mayer 


s early as 1806, a British 

doctor, Thomas Young, was 
using the word “energy” in its 
modern sense: the capacity to 
do work. In 1842, another 
doctor, Julius von Mayer of 
Germany, stated that energy 
cannot be created or destroyed. 
Mayer did not have much 
supporting evidence, and at the 
time few people understood 
what he was saying, but this 
principle of conservation of 
energy has since become 
central to science. The 
principle was discovered 
independently by at least three 
others with more influence: 
William Grove in 1846, and 
James Joule and Hermann von 
Helmholtz in 1847.

rotary press was built by US 
engineer Richard Hoe in 1845. 
It could print two sheets a 
second, but had one snag: if all 
the pieces of type on its 
revolving cylinder were not 
locked in tightly, they shot out 
when the press started.

had also tried ether as a local 
anaesthetic. Morton thought 
that he would try to get his 
patients to inhale ether, and 
he used it in a successful 
demonstration of anaesthetic 
surgery in 1846. A year later, 
Scottish surgeon James 
Simpson started using 
chloroform to help women

to mechanize sewing. The 
solution was to use two threads. 
An eye-pointed needle pushed 
one thread through the cloth 
from above while a shuttle 
whizzing to and fro below 
looped another thread through 
it. Walter Hunt invented this in 
the US in about 1843, and 
Elias Howe patented the same 
idea in 1846, but we really owe 
the sewing machine to US 
inventor Isaac Singer. He added 
his own ideas to Howe's and 
turned a raw invention into a 
mass-market product.

looked there on September 23 
1846, he found the planet 
within an hour. A British 
mathematician, John Adams, 
had already done the same 
calculation in 1844, but 
British astronomers did not 
take this seriously.

Nitroglycerine 


Ascanio Sobrero 


Lt 846, the only widely 
used explosive was 
gunpowder. Then Italian 
chemist Ascanio Sobrero 
discovered nitroglycerine, the 
first “high explosive.” Much 
more powerful than 
gunpowder, it is also extremely 
dangerous: just dropping a 
container of the chemical on 
the floor can cause a 
devastating explosion. Despite 
this problem, nitroglycerine was 
used in mining even before a 
way was found to make it safe.

traveled along them. Du Bois- 
Reymond realized that far from 
being channels for “animal 
spirits”, as some people had 
thought, nerves were more like 
telegraph wires delivering

Laws of 
thermodynamics 


William Thomson, 
Rudolf Clausius 


he first law of 

thermodynamics is just 
conservation of energy (%* see 
page 135). The second is: heat 
energy flows only from hot to 
cold. The consequences are 
surprising. For example, a glass 
of cold water contains more 
heat than a teaspoonful of 
boiling water (even though the 
boiling water has a higher 
temperature) because there is 
more of it. But the second law 
prevents this heat from doing 
any work. Several scientists 
worked on this idea from 
1824 onward. William 
Thomson coined the term 
“thermodynamics” in 1849 and 
Rudolf Clausius published the 
laws in 1850. Since then, two 
more have been added.

Could the opposite be true? 
When British physicist James 
Joule announced in 1847 that 
he had warmed water simply 
by stirring it, nobody believed 
him. After a further two years’ 
work, Joule submitted a paper 
to the Royal Society called On 
the Mechanical Equivalent of 
Heat, which was accepted. It 
stated exactly how much heat 
was produced by a given 
amount of work. The unit of 
energy now bears his name.

SCIENCE TAKES 


CONTROL 


THE LATE 19TH CENTURY saw the rise of totally 
new industries that could not have existed 
without science. Plastics, synthetic fabrics, 
electric light, telephones, sound recording, 
popular photography, cars, and radio were 

just a few of the inventions that would 
eventually transform people’s lives.

Mechanism of 
the inner ear 


Alfonso Corti 


B24 deep inside the ear 
is the organ of Corti, a 
delicate mechanism that turns 
sound into nerve impulses. It 
was first described in 1851 by 
Italian anatomist Alfonso 
Corti. It contains thousands of 
tiny hairs, which brush against 
a membrane suspended in 
fluid. When sound waves 
shake the fluid, the membrane 
ripples against the hairs, 
making nerve cells attached to 
them send signals to the brain. 


Prefabricated 
building 


Joseph Paxton 


I 1851, British gardener 
Joseph Paxton created the 
first large building made from 
prefabricated components. The 
Crystal Palace was built to 
house the Great Exhibition in 
London. The spectacular glass 
and iron structure was 1,848 ft 
(563 m) long, 108 ft (33 m) 
high and 408 ft (124 m) at its 
widest point. It went up in just 
six months. Paxton’s secret was 
the repeated use of basic parts 
that slotted together like a 
construction kit.

more. The cold gas can then 
cool other objects. US doctor 
John Gorrie found that he 
could produce cold air to cool 
feverish patients in this way, 
and patented a refrigerator 
based on this principle in 
1851. Eight years later, French 
inventor Ferdinand Carré 
developed a refrigerator more 
like those we use today. These 
use a working fluid that

Ithough calotypes could 
be reprinted, their paper 
negatives were grainy (%* see 
page 133). In 1851, British 
sculptor Frederick Archer 
made the first transparent 
negatives by coating glass 
with a light-sensitive cellulose 
solution. The new plates 
produced clearer pictures than 
their predecessors, and needed 
shorter exposures, but they had 
to be exposed while wet and 
developed immediately. The 
results were so good that 
photographers did not mind, 
and “wet plates” quickly 
replaced the earlier processes.

Giffard’s airship was the 
first successful powered flying 
machine. As in all airships, lift 
came from a light gas, in this 
case hydrogen, so its three- 
horsepower steam engine had 
only to push it along. Choosing 
a dead calm day, Giffard piloted 
the 144 ft (44 m) cigar-shaped 
craft over Paris at a speed of 

6 mph (10 km/h) for 20 miles 
(30 km). It would be years 
before airships could cope with 
windy conditions.

direction of its axis. Jean 
Foucault used this fact to 
confirm his earlier observation 
of the Earth rotating beneath a 
swinging pendulum (%* see 
page 139). In 1852, he 
mounted a wheel so that its 
axis was free to point in any 
direction. He set it spinning 
and watched as it kept its 
position while the Earth turned 
beneath it. He called this 
arrangement a gyroscope, 
meaning “something that 
makes rotation visible.”

advocated long, baggy pants

of a new costume that she 
hoped would liberate 
women. When she appeared 
in her pants in about 1853, 
there was more laughter 
than liberation, But within 
35 years, a new invention 
made “bloomers” seem like 
a good idea: they were 
ideal for women who 
wanted to ride a bike.

a recurring nightmare. Knowing 
that people were scared of 
elevators, he invented a safety 
hoist with arms that shot out 
and grabbed the sides of the 
elevator shaft if the supporting 
cable broke. He sold the first 
safety hoist, for goods only, in 
1853. Later, in New York City, 
he demonstrated its 
effectiveness by having the 
cable cut while he was in it. He 
installed his first passenger 
safety elevator in 1857 ina 
New York store. After his death, 
his sons, Charles and Norton,

George Boole had to learn the

24 he was submitting work to 
serious mathematical journals. 
He thought that logic should be 
part of math, and in 1854 he 
published An Investigation into 
the Laws of Thought. It described 
what is now called Boolean 
algebra. This allows 
complicated logical statements 
to be simplified, and underlies 
the design of much digital 
hardware and software.

be stuck into the can top and 
worked around the rim. But the

US when a canned-beef

Atlantic. He recruited several 
brilliant engineers and 
scientists, including Charles 
Bright and William Thomson. 
After heroic efforts, a cable was 
laid in 1858 to great rejoicing 
on both sides. There were 
problems, including poor 
insulation, which made the 
cable fail within weeks, but it 
proved that the idea worked.

evidence that animals and 
plants were not created as we 
see them today, but evolved 
from earlier forms and are still

based on what he called natural 
selection. Every member of a 
species is slightly different. 
Darwin said that the members 
with differences that make 
them more able to compete are 
more likely to survive and pass 
on these useful differences to 
their offspring. (%* See also

Ba an engine’s fuel

boiler promised a smaller, more 
efficient machine. But the first 
successful engine of this type 
was not particularly small and 
certainly not very efficient. 
Invented by French engineer 
Etienne Lenoir in 1859, it 

was basically a steam engine 
converted to run on gas. Its 
single piston sucked a mixture 
of gas and air into a cylinder. 
A spark then lit the mixture 

to push the piston out again.

ARGUING ABOUT APES 


ALTHOUGH MOST SCIENTISTS accepted 
Darwin’s theory, the public and most 
of the Church were not so happy. As 
well as contradicting religious 
beliefs, the theory implied that living 
creatures were ruled entirely by 
physical laws. Worse still, it seemed 
to treat people as animals descended 
from apes. Fortunately for Darwin, 
who was a shy man, his friend, the 
naturalist Thomas Huxley, positively 
enjoyed speaking up for him in the 
great debate. 


LIFE BEFORE DARWIN 

Most people thought species were fixed, 
or replaced occasionally by God. Some 
scientists had proposed theories of 
evolution: Jean Lamarck thought that 
animals could pass on changes that 
happened to them during their lives. 


How DARWIN GOT HIS IDEAS 

Darwin saw that finches on various Pacific 
islands were different. He also looked at the 
fossil record. The idea of natural selection 
came to him after he read an essay by the 
naturalist Thomas Malthus. Malthus said 
that animals compete to survive, and 
Darwin realized that competition could 
explain why animals change.

area, which helps us to find the 
right words. It was identified 
by French surgeon and 
anthropologist Paul Broca in 
1861. He studied people with 
injuries that made them speak 
hesitantly, but did not stop 
them from understanding what 
people said. He usually found 
damage to an area in the front 
left of the brain, It was the first 
time that anyone had identified 
a part of the brain with a 
particular job. Other scientists, 
notably the German neurologist 
Carl Wernicke, later found 
areas near Broca’s that were 
associated with other aspects of 
speech and language. 


In 1874, when this cartoon was published, the idea of 
people having apes for ancestors still seemed strange. 


NEW FORMS OF DARWINISM 

Darwin’s theory fits well with modern genetics, 
but not all scientists accept it completely. The 
renowned US geologist Stephen Jay Gould says 
that it fails to explain the way species have 
evolved in jumps, rather than smoothly.

he Yale is probably the 

most widely used type of 
lock. It was invented in the US 
in 1861, and is based on a 
principle known to the ancient 
Egyptians: several pins stop the 
lock from moving until the 
right key pushes them all into 
the right positions. Linus Yale’s 
father had designed a lock 
using this “pin tumbler” idea in 
1848, but it was Linus Yale Jr.

from the great French 
scientist Louis Pasteur, who 
was the first person to show 
that invisible organisms can 
spoil food and cause disease. 
He invented the process in 
1865. It makes liquids hot 
enough to kill any harmful 
organisms without destroying 
their food value. For example, 
milk can be pasteurized by 
being heated to 145°F (63°C) 
for 30 minutes, then quickly 
chilled for storage. Although 
pasteurization increases food 
safety, some people prefer 
untreated dairy products

ineteenth-century doctors 

knew that a patient’s

British physician Thomas 
Allbutt invented the clinical 
thermometer, there was no 
convenient way of measuring it. 
The only thermometers 
available could take 20 minutes 
to give a reading, and some of 
them were 12 in (30 cm) long. 
Allbutt reduced them to a 
pocket-sized instrument, which 
was not only more convenient 
to handle but also worked 
much faster. He usually put his 
thermometer under a patient’s 
arm, not in their mouth.

Germs 


Louis Pasteur 


L the mid 19th century, 
some natural processes 
were still a mystery. What 
turned grape juice into 
wine, for example? Why 
did it sometimes go sour? 
French chemist Louis 
Pasteur proved that invisible 
organisms were responsible. 
He also proved that diseases 
were transmitted by 
microorganisms, rather than 
polluted air. The Academy of 
Sciences officially accepted 
his conclusions in 1864, and 
Pasteur was given his own 
laboratory at France’s Ecole 
Supérieure in 1867. His 
“germ” theory then began 

to be more widely accepted. 
By establishing the reality 

of germs, Pasteur 
revolutionized medicine 

and the food industry.

THE BUG HUNTERS 


OTHERS BEFORE PASTEUR had thought that invasion 
by invisible organisms might be responsible for 
decay and disease. But they had not been able to 
prove it, so most people believed that decaying 
matter created life by “spontaneous generation.” 
Even after Pasteur, many people found it hard to 
believe in the invisible killers. Those who did, 
such as Scottish surgeon Joseph Lister and German 
doctor Robert Koch, made great progress. 


GERMS BEFORE PASTEUR 

In 100 Bc, a Roman writer declared that disease was caused by 
an invisible invasion. Much later, in 1684, Francesco Redi wrote 
that spontaneous generation could not occur because “only life 
produces life.” In the 19th century, Italian scientist Agostino 
Bassi showed that a disease of silkworms was caused by 
infection with invisible fungus spores. 


PASTEUR’S LEGACY 
German doctor Robert Koch showed that bacteria could be 
bred in the laboratory, and established many of the techniques 
of bacteriology. By 1883, he had isolated the organisms that 
cause cholera and tuberculosis. Scientists now know that not 
all bacteria are bad: we 
depend on many 
microorganisms inside 
our bodies to keep them 
working properly.

and then glued to form a loop, 
and it has weird properties. For 
example, it has only one edge 
and it is impossible to make 
each side of it a different color 
because it has only one side. 
When cut down the center, it 
opens out into a single loop

called a Klein bottle, which has

stomach. When French 
inventor Hippolyte Mége- 
Mouriés concocted it in 1869, 
Napoleon III awarded him a 
prize for producing the first 
alternative to butter. It soon 
improved, and by 1885 it 
was enough of a threat to the 
dairy industry for the British 
government to stop the use of 
its original name, “Butterine”.

Air brake 


George Westinghouse 


o stop a long train, the 

brakes must be applied to

inventor George Westinghouse

air. Unlike a mechanical linkage, 
air can be taken from carriage 
to carriage easily. Westinghouse’s 
system also had an important 
safety feature. The brakes were 
held in the off position by air 
pressure and applied by 
releasing it, so any leaks 
automatically put them on.

he main ingredient of 

chewing gum is chicle, a 
rubbery substance from a 
Central American tree. Many 
19th-century inventors tried to 
use it like rubber. One of them 
was US photographer Thomas 
Adams, who bought some from 
a Mexican. He failed to make 
rubber, but he noticed that the 
Mexican liked chewing chicle. 
In 1869, he boiled up some 
with flavorings and offered it to 
a store. Customers loved it.

He noticed that paper indented 
with the signals made sounds

he made a machine with tinfoil

cylinder and a needle connected 
to a thin metal disc. When he 
spoke, the disc vibrated and

owner had asked him to settle 
an argument: did a galloping 
horse ever lift all its hooves off 
the ground at once? In 1877, 
Muybridge set up a row of 
cameras along a racetrack. As a 
horse galloped by, it tripped 
their shutters, making each 
camera record a different part 
of the movement. The answer 
to the question was “yes.”

would last long. Edison tried 
platinum, but soon switched to 
carbon, which Swan had first 
tried 20 years earlier. By 1880, 
both inventors had produced 
good light bulbs, which they 
showed off at the 1881 Paris

four-stroke. The first effective 
two-stroke engine was invented 
by Scottish engineer Dugald 
Clerk in 1879 and patented in 
1881. It was designed to run 
on coal gas to power workshop 
machinery. Two-stroke engines 
are now used for things like 
scooters and lawnmowers,

DOING AWAY WITH DISTANCE 


Helped by Thomas Watson, 
Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone 


Bell’s box telephone 
incorporated a larger 
magnet than others, which 
made it more sensitive. 


Bell demonstrated this 
telephone to Queen 
Victoria. 


PUBLICITY MACHINE 
Bell was an expert 
at publicity. His 
crude laboratory 
instruments 
became fine 
objects of 
polished brass, 
rich wood, and ivory when 
they were to be demonstrated 
to someone as important as 
Queen Victoria. Bell made a 
good impression on the Queen 
when they met in 1878, 
despite making the mistake of 
touching her arm without 
permission to attract her 
attention to an incoming call. 


Early telephone cable 


‘WIRED FOR SOUND 

As telephones became more 
popular, cities got choked with 
overhead wires, so some lines 
went underground. Early phone 
cables contained many paper- 
insulated wires in a lead sheath. 


152 


[ was Valentine’s day, 1876. A good day to tell 

the world about an invention that would help people 
communicate. It’s lucky Alexander Graham Bell didn’t 
leave it any longer. Two hours after he’d deposited papers 
describing his telephone to people at the US Patent 


Office, his rival, Elisha Gray, 
warned them that he was about to 
do the same. But Bell was first. 

It was hard on Gray. Both men had 
similar ideas but Bell had an advantage: 
he knew more about speech and hearing. 
Bell's father was a speech teacher and had 
invented a way to help deaf people speak. 
His grandfather had given speech lessons, 
so as Alexander grew up in Edinburgh, 
Scotland, he was surrounded by ideas 
about speech and hearing. He even got 
his dog to talk by making it growl, then 
moving its mouth with his hands! 

The family emigrated to Canada in 


1870. Bell went to Boston, where he opened a school for teachers of the 
deaf. He experimented with a harmonic telegraph, which sent messages as 
dots and dashes similar to musical notes. Bell noticed that a strip of iron 
near an electromagnet mimicked the vibrations of a similar strip and 


electromagnet connected to it by 
wires. He thought he might use 
this to transmit speech. 
With mechanic Thomas 
Watson, he tried hard to make 
electric currents imitate sound 


waves. The original arrangement wasn’t sensitive enough, so Bell tried a 
needle dipping into acid. The needle was attached to a sheet of parchment 
stretched on a frame, with a horn to concentrate sound on to it. Sound 
shook the parchment, which varied the resistance of the needle’s contact 
with the acid, which, in turn, varied the current.

contained acid. Bell may have 
called out to Watson because

The telephone didn’t work at first. But on Friday, 
March 10, 1876, while Bell was fiddling with the transmitter 
in one room and Watson was working on the receiver in 
another, Bell said, “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.” 
And Watson came. He had heard Bell’s words, the first 
ever spoken on a telephone. Bell’s earlier patent did 
not include the liquid transmitter that made the 
transmission of speech possible, so he went back to ; 
his original design and improved it. By 1877, he had CLOSE CALL

there is one circle representing 
cats, another black things, and 
a third green things. The cat 
circle would be drawn to 
overlap the black circle, but not 
the green circle, to show that 
some cats are black but no cats 
are green. The idea can be 
extended to much more 
complicated statements.

a year after Edison had 
demonstrated the idea in 
London. Edison’s system 
provided brighter, safer lighting 
than gas, but it used direct 
current, which did not transmit 
over long distances. Because of 
this, it lost out to alternating

to get more light from gas. 
He found that salts of thorium 
and cerium gave out an intense 
ight when deposited on 
asbestos fibers and heated. 
By the 1890s, gas lamps were 
wearing little knitted covers 
<nown as mantles over their 
ames. When a lamp was lit, 
the metals in its mantle gave 
out enough light to rival an 
electric bulb. 


Car 


Karl Benz, 
Gottlieb Daimler, 
Emile Levassor 


he first car, the 

Motorwagen, was 
built in 1885 by 
German engineer Karl 
Benz. It was a three- 
wheeler with a single- 
cylinder engine. Soon 
Benz and others 
were making four- 
wheeled cars, In 
1889, Gottlieb 
Daimler produced 
one with four gears. 
But it was French 


engineer Emile Levassor who 
produced the first car with its 
engine at the front, driving the 
rear wheels through a clutch 
and gearbox. His 1891 model 
was the forerunner of the cars 
we drive today. 


Monotype 
typesetting

Tolbert Lanston 


Or of the slowest operations 
in traditional printing was 
setting up type. By the 1880s 
several inventors were trying 

to mechanize the process. 

First to succeed was US 
inventor Tolbert Lanston. 
His Monotype system 
of 1885 had a keyboard | 
and a machine for 
casting type from molten 
metal. The caster

followed instructions created 
by the keyboard, delivering 
type almost ready to print. 
Monotype dominated book 
printing for more than 70 years. 


Gasoline engine 


Gottlieb Daimler, 
Wilhelm Maybach 


he gasoline engine evolved 

from engines that ran on 
natural gas. These could not 
run on liquid fuel, so the 
carburetor, which turns 
gasoline into a mist and mixes 
it with air, was an essential 
component of a gasoline 
engine. By 1885, German 
engineers Gottlieb Daimler and 


1851 -— 1900 


Wilhelm Maybach had designed 
an effective carburetor. They 
used it in a new high-speed 
engine, which was the first 
true gasoline engine and the 
forerunner of those that power 
most cars today. 


Rabies vaccine 


Louis Pasteur 


| Pate is an infection of the 
nervous system, which 
people can catch from animal 
bites, and usually kills if not 
caught in time. The French 
biologist Louis Pasteur 
developed the first vaccine 
against rabies by heating tissue 
from infected animals to create 
a weakened virus. On 6 July, 
1885, he gave a dramatic 

demonstration of 

its power by 

vaccinating a boy 
who had been bitten 
by a dog with rabies. 
The boy lived. 


CAR This Benz car, made in 1888, 
was sold by Emile Roger, Benz's agent 
in Paris. It had a tubular metal frame, 
like a bicycle, and bodywork based on 
horse-drawn vehicles. The engine was 
at the rear, below the driver's seat. 


1884 The London Society

Cruelty to Children is founded 

following the passing of a cruelty 


law. Later, it will link with other 
societies to form the National

Ithough tall buildings 

can be built with brick 
or stone, real skyscrapers need 
a steel frame. The first such 
building was designed by US 
engineer William Jenney in 
1884. Built in Chicago, it was 
completed in 1885 and was 
10 storys high. Its steel frame 
took much of the weight of 
its stone walls. By the 1930s, 
this idea had been extended to 
produce walls hung from the 
frame, called curtain walls. 


Coca-Cola 


John Pemberton 


n 1886, pharmacist John 

Pemberton of Atlanta, 
Georgia, invented a new drink. 
Its ingredients included cocaine 
from coca plants and caffeine 
from kola nuts, so he called it 
Coca-Cola. (The cocaine was 
left out from 1903 onwards). 
When Pemberton put the drink 
into local shops, it became 
wildly popular. By 1892, the 
Coca-Cola Company was born. 


Inexpensive 
aluminium 


Charles Hall, 
Paul Héroult 


luminium is the most 

common metal on 
Earth, but was once too 
expensive to use. It is 
found as aluminum oxide, 
whose oxygen cannot 
easily be removed 
by chemical 
means. In 1886, 
both Charles Hall 
in the US and Paul 
Héroult in France 


dissolved aluminum oxide in 
molten cryolite (sodium 
aluminum fluoride) and used 
electricity to drag the 
aluminum and oxygen apart. 
The Hall-Héroult process has 
transformed aluminum from an 
exotic curiosity to the stuff of 
jumbo jets and soda cans. 


Recording 
on wax 


Chichester Bell, 
Charles Tainter 


he first sound recordings 

were made on foil wrapped 
around a grooved cylinder. A 
needle, moving up and down, 
created “hills and dales” in 
the shape of the sound waves. 
These recordings were fragile 
and inaccurate. In 1886, US 
inventors Chichester Bell and 
Charles Tainter patented a 
machine called the 
Graphophone, which recorded 
on waxed cardboard cylinders. 
The wax, together with a 
recording stylus that made a 
v-shaped groove, gave better 
sound. They were soon in use 
for all recordings.

he semicircular canals of 

the inner ear are three 
fluid-filled tubes joined 
together at right angles. In 
1824, French biologist Marie 
Flourens noticed that pigeons 
moved strangely after a tube 
was cut. In 1886, another 
French biologist, Yves Delage, 


Moving the head moves the

and tell the brain which way 
the head is moving. 


Linotype

Ottmar Mergenthaler 


Ls the 1970s, most 
newspapers were set in 
type using a machine invented 
by German-US engineer Ottmar 
Mergenthaler in 1886. The 
Linotype machine used molten 
metal, but instead of making 
individual letters like the 
Monotype machine (%* see 
page 157), it produced whole 
lines of type — hence the name. 
Newspaper printers liked it 
because it was quick to use and 
needed only one operator.

had to decide what to do 

about them. Should they kill 
them with antiseptics or try to 
keep them out of the operating 
room from the start? Today, the 
second approach is normal 
practice. It was pioneered by 
German surgeon Ernst von 
Bergmann in 1886. He was 

the first person to sterilize 
instruments and dressings with 
steam. He later made everything 
else used in operations as 
germ-free as possible.

the late 19th to the mid 20th 
century. While its rival, the 
Burroughs machine (* see 
page 156), could produce 
a printed record, the 
Comptometer was faster. 
Invented by US engineer Dorr 
E. Felt, it was first used in 
1887. As with the Burroughs 
machine, numbers were 
entered using columns of keys 
— one for units, one for tens, 
and so on. The result was 
displayed in a set of windows 
for clerks to copy out by hand.

Sebastian de Ferranti 


n the 1880s there were many 

rival electricity systems. But 
British engineer Sebastian de 
Ferranti could see the future. 
Electricity would be generated 
in big power stations outside 
cities, not little ones inside 
them, and transmitted at high 
voltage. In 1887, he designed a 
giant power station at Deptford, 
just outside London, and cables 
that could take 10,000 volts. 
The station’s directors pushed 
him out in 1891, and it was 
not completed to his plan. But 
Ferranti was right: high-voltage 
transmission is universal today. 


Steam tricycle 


Leon Serpollet 


A one time it looked as 
though steam, not 
gasoline, might be best for 
motor vehicles. Several 
inventors designed steam 
tricycles in the 1880s. In 1887, 
French engineer Leon Serpollet 
overcame their chief problem 
with a boiler that produced 
instant steam. He built this into 
a tricycle, then showed it off by 
driving it 282 miles (451 km) 
from Paris to Lyon. Later, he 
built steam cars. In 1903, one 
reached 80 mph (130 km/h).

by Scottish vet John

experimented with 
rubber tubing on 
the wheels of his 
son’s tricycle. The 
finished product

Gideon Sundback realized that 
the hooks were the problem. 
By 1914 he had developed the 
modern fastener, with cups, not 
hooks, locking together. It was 
used in 1923 for a boot called 
the Zipper, and the name stuck.

It has killed millions in 
repeated epidemics. Thanks 
to the discoveries of Japanese 
and Swiss bacteriologists 
Kitasato Shibasaburo and 
Alexandre Yersin in 1894, we 
now know that it is caused 
by a type of germ known as 
a bacillus. It is usually called 
Yersinia pestis in honor of 
Yersin’s contribution.

hotography offers an

Letters can be projected on to

machine, designed in 1894 
by Hungarian engineer Eugene 
Porzolt, was a failure. But from 
the 1960s, with computers 
controlling the process, 


way most words got printed. 
Computers now store letter 
shapes in digital form. So, like 
metal type, phototypesetting 
itself is now a thing of the past.

Marconi started 
experimenting with radio 
waves in 1894, when he was 
only 19. Others, such as the 
British and Russian physicists 
Oliver Lodge and Alexander 
Popov, did the same. But it 
was Marconi who really got 
radio going. Within a year 
he was sending signals 
1.25 miles (2 km). By 1896 
he was in Britain and had the 
world’s first radio patent. 
After much further 
development, it was 
Marconi’s “wireless 
telegraph” that sent the 
distress signals from the 
sinking ship Titanic in 1912.

known 
as an inert gas

used in lightbulbs because 
it makes the filament

discovered by British 
physicist Lord Rayleigh, 
who noticed that nitrogen 
from air was denser than 
nitrogen from chemicals. 
Both he and British chemist 
William (later Sir William) 
Ramsay thought that 
atmospheric nitrogen might 
be contaminated with an 


unknown, heavier gas. They 
both found it in 1894. Its name 
“argon” is Greek for “inactive”.

audience a moving picture 
that ran for several minutes. 
Their machine acted as both 
camera and projector. It gave 
its first public performance on 
December 28, 1895, in Paris. 
The program of 12 short 
films, including one showing 
Lumiere factory workers, 
caused a sensation. 


Helium on

William Ramsay 


I | elium, the gas that 
is used to fill party 


balloons, was first found on 
Earth by William Ramsay in 
1895. He heated a mineral 
called cleveite, which contains 
uranium, and discovered that 
it gave off a gas. The gas’s 
spectrum contained a yellow 
line matching that of helium 
in the Sun, which proved its 
identity. Swedish chemists 
Nils Langlet and Per Cleve 
also found the gas at about 
the same time. Later, Ramsay 
and British chemist Frederick 
Soddy discovered that helium 
is produced whenever 
radioactive elements decay.

f air is made cold enough, it

compressing air, letting it cool, 
then letting it expand so that it 
cools still further. The first to 
do this on a 
large scale 
was German 
engineer 
Carl von 
Linde. 


His system, invented in 1895, 
produced a continuous stream 
of liquid air. He later distilled 
air to produce liquid nitrogen, 
used as a coolant, and liquid 

oxygen, used in 
steel making.

worked out that the cathode 
rays, hitting the glass of the 
tube, were producing other 
rays that made the crystals 
glow. He did some further 
experiments, which showed 
that the rays could pass 
through solid objects and 
affect photographic plates. 

This led him to make the first 
ever X-ray picture. At first, 
Rontgen was not sure that he 
should announce his discovery. 
He was worried that other 
scientists might not believe 
him. But soon everyone was 
talking about the new rays that 
made hidden things visible. 


Radiation from

Henri Becquerel 


rench physicist Henri 

Becquerel wanted to 
see if crystals that glowed after 
exposure to sunlight gave out 
X-rays. In 1896, he found that 
certain uranium salts affected a 
wrapped-up photographic plate 
when placed on it in sunlight. 
Becquerel thought that sunlight 
may have made the crystals 
produce X-rays, which went 
through the wrapping. Then he 
discovered that the experiment 
worked in the dark. The 
crystals gave out penetrating 
radiation all by themselves.

PARTNERS IN DISCOVERY 


Marie and Pierre Curie discover radium and 

make radiotherapy possible 

c 1891, Marie Sklodowska arrived in Paris, aged 23. She had done 
well in school in Poland and now, after eight years as a governess, 

she had saved enough money for college. She registered at the 

Sorbonne, the university in Paris, and became a student, studying 

physical science and mathematics. 

By 1894, Marie had her degree. Something else important 
happened that year, too. She met Professor Pierre Curie, and in 1895 
they got married, forming one of science’s most fruitful partnerships. 

Marie decided to research the uranium radiation recently 
discovered by Henri Becquerel. She studied pitchblende, a 
mineral containing uranium, and found that it produced 
more radiation than the uranium alone could account for. 
It clearly contained something more “radioactive,” as ’ 
she called it, than uranium. With Pierre, she dissolved 
pitchblende in chemicals to produce compounds they 
could separate out. Work stopped briefly in 1897 for 
the birth of Marie’s first daughter. 

In the summer of 1898, the Curies found a new 
radioactive element, polonium, but there was more 
radiation still unaccounted for. Its source must be 
very radioactive indeed. Although they hadn’t 
isolated it yet, they dubbed it radium, 
announcing their discovery in December. 

After another four years’ work, Marie had 
produced just one-tenth of a gram of pure 
radium chloride. She became a Doctor of 
Science — the first woman in Europe 
to do so — and in 1903 shared the 
Nobel prize for physics with Pierre and 
Becquerel. As the first woman to win a

IT TOOK A CENTURY of thought

The two big problems were lift and

came with the observation that a bird’s tail 
is as important as its wings. The early pioneers 
also realized that flapping wings were not 
essential, which led to a practical aeroplane 
driven by a propeller.

A wealthy aristocrat, Cayley had

ORIGINAL GENIUS 

Albert Einstein was a highly 
original thinker who gave us a 
new view of the world. As well 
as creating the Special and 
General Theories of Relativity, he 
contributed greatly to the 
quantum theory of matter. 


At its simplest, the Special Theory says that 
the mass of an object depends on its speed. If 
a force acts on an object, it accelerates, but as 
it speeds up, more energy goes into increasing 
its mass and less into increasing its speed. This 
prevents it from reaching the speed of light. One 
consequence is the equation E = mc, which 
says that mass and energy are interchangeable. 

Although revolutionary, the Special Theory 
was incomplete. It did not deal with gravity. 
Einstein put this right in 1915 with his General acs of 
Relativity. Replacing Newton's space and time with a unified 
space-time, it proposed that gravity was a property of space, 
not a force between bodies. It led to amazing predictions, 
such as the bending of light by gravity and the existence 
of black holes, both of which have since been confirmed. 


BLACK HOLE 
Gravity, a warping of space and 
time, affects everything — even 
light. Black holes create gravity 
so intense that light is trapped, 
but they can be detected by 

,. their effects. In this 
peaue, matter is 
being pulled 
away from a 
giant star. 


Young Albert was ill in

it react with hydrogen, forming 
ammonia, which could be 
made into fertilizers and other

INVENTIONS FOR EVERYONE 


A MOTOR FOR THE MULTITUDE 


Henry Ford adopts the assembly line to mass 
produce the world’s most successful car 


MAN OF VISION 

Henry Ford looked to a 
future in which efficient 
production methods 
would make everyone 
rich. His factory 
eventually had raw 
materials going in at 
one end and finished 
cars coming out 

at the other. 


fi 1891, when the first modern 
car was built, Henry Ford was 

a young engineer working in 
Detroit, Michigan, not far from 
the farm where he had been born. 
Most people still worked on the land. 

Ford would be one of the people who 
helped to change this, transforming the US 

into an industrial nation. 
Te and 1927, > By 1896, Ford had built his first car. In 1903, 
one of every two cars he set up the Ford Motor Company. At that time, cars were 
a el individually built and very expensive, so they were strictly for the 
construction and low E rich. Ford realized he 
rice, it was ideal for S—— could keep costs down by 
the still rural US. . s 
producing just one type of 

car, and in 1908 he launched 
“a motor car for the great 
multitude” — the Model T. 

Demand for the “Tin Lizzie,” as 
it was nicknamed, was soon running 
ahead of supply, and Ford moved to 
a new factory at Highland Park, just 
outside Detroit. Even here, people still 
had to walk from car to car to work on 
each one — and when they were walking 
they were not working. 

Ford wanted to find a faster, less 
expensive production method. In the US 
meat industry, workers stood still while 
carcasses were moved slowly past them. 

In 1913, Ford experimented with this 
“assembly line” idea for making part of the 
Model T. Output of the part went up by 
300 percent, so he decided to make the 
whole car on an assembly line. 


Model T Tourer (1916) 


MORE CARS 

The Ford story does 
not, of course, end 
with the Model T. 
Later designs 
included the sleek 
Edsel, the sporty 
Mustang, and the 
GT40, designed 

in Britain and built 
for serious racing.

Ford GT40 (1964)

Now, instead of wandering around 
the factory, workers spent all their time 
adding parts to cars as they passed by. 
Each worker did only one operation, 
and their pace was set by the moving 
line. By April 1914, Ford had cut the 
time it took to make a car from 12 
man-hours to one and a half. Soon the 
factory was turning out a car every 

24 seconds. The Model T became the 


world’s most successful car, with total sales reaching more than 15 million. 


The assembly line did have its disadvantages. Working in this way 
was stressful, so workers often left. Ford solved this problem by doubling 
his workers’ pay and reducing the hours they had to work. It seemed 
crazy, but it was just good business. Ford realized that his employees 
had a private life and didn’t just make cars. Thanks to his new methods, 
they would soon be buying them, too. 


1901 — 1950 


Ford succeeded in his mission to bring mobility 
to the masses, and in doing so changed the 
American way of life. As well as providing 
pleasure on picnics, low-cost vehicles made 


every industry more efficient. 


MODERN MANUFACTURE 

The first cars had their bodies 
bolted onto a separate chassis, 
but today’s car body is a single, 
self-supporting steel shell. For 
many years, the shell was hand- 
welded together by skilled 
workers, but such heavy, 
repetitive tasks are now done 
by robots, like these at Ford’s 
plant in Ontario, Canada.

Structure of the 
atom 


Niels Bohr 


ritish physicist Ernest 

Rutherford pictured the 
hydrogen atom as a heavy 
nucleus with an electron 
orbiting around it. But classical 
physics said this could not be 
right because the electron 
would radiate energy and 
stop orbiting. Danish physicist 
Niels Bohr saved the situation 
in 1913 by showing that 
electrons could radiate energy 
only when jumping from a 
higher to a lower orbit. The 
radiation would appear as light 
whose frequency depended on 
the size of the jump. 


Bra 


Mary Jacob 
A though a “breast 


supporter” was patented in 
1893, the idea didn’t catch on 
until New York partygoer Mary 
Jacob realized that whalebone 
corsets and her new, slinky 
dress just didn’t go together. 
She sewed together a couple of 
handkerchiefs and some ribbon 
and wore that instead of the 
whalebone. In 1914, she 
changed her name to Caresse 
Crosby, patented the brassiére, 
and started selling it. Although 
she was not very successful in 
this, she did manage to sell the 
idea to a big corset company, 
and by the 1920s women 
everywhere were wearing bras.

Intelligence test 


Lewis Terman 


Ithough nobody seems to 

know whether intelligence 
can really be measured, 
intelligence tests are still in 
use. Their results are expressed 
as an “intelligence quotient,” 
or 1Q, with an 1Q of 100 
representing average 
intelligence. The first widely 
used test, the Stanford-Binet, 
was published in 1916 by US 
psychologist Lewis Terman. 
A professor at Stanford 
University, Terman based his 
test on earlier ones devised by 
French psychologists Alfred 
Binet and Theodore Simon.

Wall anchor 


John Rawlings 


ritish builder John Rawlings 

didn’t like the way other 
builders attached things to 
walls. They just chiseled out a 
large hole, rammed in a lump 
of wood and put a screw in it. 
The attachment was weak, and 
it messed up the wall. Rawlings 
realized that screws would grip 
small, drilled holes if they were 
surrounded by something that 
expanded as they went in. After 
trying brass, he devised a wall 
anchor made of fiber. Once he 
had convinced people that such 


a neat device could do the job, 
the Rawlplug became everyone’s 
favorite wall anchor. 


Public

David Sarnoff, 
Guglielmo Marconi 


Ithough US engineer 

Reginald Fessenden 
broadcast speech and music in 
1906, and US radio executive 
David Sarnoff proposed a “radio 
music box” in 1915, real public 
broadcasting only began in the 
1920s. By this time, electronics 
had developed greatly, allowing 
big transmitters to be built. The 
irst regular service was started 
in Britain by Guglielmo Marconi 
in February 1920. In November 
1920, US station KDKA began 
broadcasting from Philadelphia. 
Governments in both countries 
later stepped in to regulate the 
new medium. (%* See also Birth 
of broadcasting.)

Socialist Republics, 
the USSR, is formed following 
the Russian revolution. The 


Congress of Soviets, controlled 
by the Bolsheviks under their 
leader Vladimir Lenin, takes over 
the former Russian Empire. 


TO TRANSMIT SOUND, a 
radio transmitter needs to generate 
powerful, continuous, high-frequency waves. Reginald Fessenden 
pioneered these with high-speed electric generators, but it was 
the development of large electronic valves during World War I 
that really made broadcasting possible. The first listeners had to 
build their own receivers because the lack of regular broadcasts 
meant there was no market for ready-made radios. 


BROADCASTING IN BRITAIN 

Marconi’s early radio broadcasts were 
banned, but after public pressure, his 
company was allowed to broadcast for 
15 minutes a week from a hut near 
Chelmsford, starting in February 1922. 
In May, the station moved to London, 
and October saw the birth of the British 
Broadcasting Company. In 1927, this 
became a public corporation, the BBC.

Unhampered by red tape, and led by

broadcasting grew rapidly. By 1922, the 
US had 600 stations, mainly financed 
by advertising, while Britain still had 
only one. But competition threatened 
chaos, so in 1927 the industry finally 
came under government regulation.

now the preferred picture of the beginning of time.

Werner Heisenberg 


| Be ee particles, such 
as electrons, are described 
by the branch of physics 
called quantum mechanics 

(% see page 169). This says 
that a particle is not only a 
particle, but also a wave. One 
consequence of this is that 
nobody can know both the 
momentum (mass x velocity) 
and position of a particle at the 
same time. Momentum comes 
from a spread-out wave, while 
position comes from a 
concentrated wave, and you 
can’t have both at once. 
German physicist Werner 
Heisenberg announced this

could blow bubbles with it. He 
had created bubble gum. His

NVENTIONS FOR EVERYONE 


THE ANTIBIOTIC MIRACLE 


Howard Florey and Ernst Chain build on 
Alexander Fleming’s find to develop a life saver 


Alexander Fleming was showing a friend some plates 
he used for growing bacteria. Suddenly he 
stopped. The plate in his hand was 

covered with bacteria, but there was also 
a patch of mold, and around the mold 
there were no bacteria. 

Fleming worked at Sir Almroth 
Wright’ vaccine laboratories in St. Marys ~ 
Hospital, London. There, he grew more mold 
and made an extract he called penicillin. He 
tested it, used it to cure an eye infection, and 
wrote about it, but pursued it no further. He was 
more interested in vaccines. Penicillin, he thought, 
would be best used in laboratories. 

Ten years later, German biochemist Ernst 
Chain, working at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford, 
England, suggested to his boss, Australian pathologist Howard Florey, that 
they should investigate penicillin. Florey decided to see if it would affect

Florey decided to make a lot 
more penicillin. Nobody in 
wartime Britain 
could help, so he 
went to the US. There, experts 
devised a better way of growing mold, and a 
drug company started producing penicillin in 
bulk. It would be needed, because by December 
1941 the US was at war. 

Back in Britain, production at Florey’s lab was 
stepped up, chemical companies started helping, 
and further tests were organized. By 1943, there 
was no doubt. Penicillin was a lifesaver. Thanks 
to Fleming, Chain, and Florey, the first antibiotic 
had arrived. Others followed within a few years. 
Together, they have saved millions of lives.

B the 1880s, scientists had 
some idea of the chemical

made a synthetic rubber good

energetic particles artificially. 
The first was built by British

by means of regular radio

boost the public’s confidence in 
their country’s leader 


Ernest Walton, and was first

“RADAR” GETS ITS NAME from “radio detection and 
ranging.” It detects objects and measures their 
distance, or range, by sending out short pulses of 
radio waves and showing if anything reflects them 
back. The time between sending a pulse and getting 
it back shows the distance of the reflecting object. 
Its direction is found by using a steerable antenna. 


EARLY RADAR 


The discoverer of radio waves, Heinrich Hertz, showed that 
they were reflected from metallic surfaces, and several early 
radio experimenters thought that they might be used to detect 
objects. German engineer Christian Hulsmeyer patented a 
detection system in 1904, and a crude form of ranging with 
radio pulses was achieved in 1925.

The first radar stations worked with quite large wavelengths. 
This made their measurements rather imprecise, and also meant 
that the stations had to be big. In 1940, the invention of the 
magnetron, which could produce much shorter waves called 
microwaves, allowed compact, precise radars to be installed in 
aircraft. Radar is now essential to aviation.

who wanted to stop all-day 
parkers clogging the streets. He 
also thought it might make a 
little money for his city. The 
Park-O-Meter, as Magee called 
it, was remarkably similar in 
appearance to the meters used 
today. Much to the annoyance 
of inconsiderate parkers, 
Magee’s idea has proved a hit 


with city authorities everywhere.

Charles Richter, 
Beno Gutenberg 


N ews reports usually rate 
earthquakes on the

by US seismologists Charles 
Richter and Beno Gutenberg, 
the scale relates to 
the energy released 
by an earthquake 
at its centre, with each step 
representing 10 times the 
energy of the previous one. 
So an earthquake measuring 
8 on the Richter scale, which 
would usually be catastrophic, 
releases a million times as 
much energy as one rated at 2, 
which wouldn't be noticed.

snorkel was a tower on top of 
a submarine. It let fresh air in 
and exhaust gases out, and 
was designed by Lieutenant 
Jan Wichers of the Royal 
Netherlands Navy in 1936. 
After the Netherlands was 
invaded by Germany in 1940, 
the Wichers snorkel idea was 
applied to German submarines. 
By 1944, these could cruise for 
hours just below the surface, 
invisible to radar.

1935 solved most of these 
problems, but the first 
helicopter to develop into a

aturday January 30, 1937, was a sad day for Scottish television pioneer 
John Logie Baird. That was when the British Broadcasting Corporation 
(BBC) finally abandoned his mechanical television system, with its whirring 
wheels and messy chemicals. He had come a long way since his first 
experiments with television in 1923, but it wasn’t far 
enough. His dream was over. The future was electronic. 
Three months earlier, on November 2, 1936, the 
BBC had started the world’ first regular, high- 
definition, public television broadcasting service. 
In alternate weeks it used two different sets of 
equipment. The idea was to test two rival 
systems. One was Baird's; the other had been 
created by a team at Electrical and Musical 
Industries (EMI) led by Russian-born engineer 
Isaac Shoenberg. The all-electronic EMI system 
won easily. Its pictures were sharper, its cameras were 
more mobile, it was more reliable, and 
it cost less. In all but detail, it was 
the system we use today. 
Shoenberg’s team had been formed 
five years earlier. They had worked 
with remarkable speed, but they weren't the 
first to research all-electronic 
television. On the other side of 
the Atlantic, a lone pioneer, 
Philo T. Farnsworth, had 
started work on his 
electronic “image dissector” 
in 1926. He gave the first 
demonstration of all- 
electronic television in 
1934. Unfortunately, his 
cameras needed too much 
light, and his work came 
to a dead end.

The two main pioneers of all- 
electronic television were both 
born in Russia. Shoenberg was 
born in 1880, and Zworykin in 
1889. Shoenberg emigrated to 
Britain in 1914, and Zworykin 
to the US in 1919. It was 
Zworykin who developed the 
first successful camera tube. It 
scanned the image with a beam 
of electrons. Tubes of this type 
were highly sensitive and could 
show fine detail. 


Britain’s first television receivers 
were very expensive, worked 
only in London, and offered only 
a single channel. But they were

By 1931, he and his team had created the first successful 
electronic camera tube, the Iconoscope. Shoenberg’s team 
later used Zworykin’s basic idea to develop their own 
Emitron tube, which formed the heart of the cameras they 
designed for the BBC. 

On September 1, 1939, as war gripped Europe, the BBC television 
service was closed down. Just four months earlier, the US’ first regular 
television service had started, when the National Broadcasting Company 
(NBC) broadcast the opening of the New York World’s Fair. Zworykin, 
Shoenberg, and a host of other engineers and enthusiasts had finally 
made the dream of television come true.

War II, DDT was used to 
protect troops from insect-

MAKING COPIES 


XEROGRAPHY GETS ITS NAME from the 
Greek “xeros” meaning “dry.” A lens 
projects an image on to a drum, 
the surface of which conducts 
electricity when exposed to 
light. Where the image is 


bright, the drum 
becomes more 
conductive and the 
electricity leaks 
away. Powdered 
resin dusted on the 
drum is attracted to 
the parts that are 
still electrified. The 
resin is transferred 
to paper and 
heated until 

it melts to 
form a 
permanent J

Copying documents used to be difficult. 
They could be photographed with a special camera, 
but this was expensive and too big for an office. Or they

It used relays — switches 
operated by electromagnets. 
As these have actual moving 
contacts, they are extremely 
slow compared with electronic 
switches. So Zuse’s Z3

the mechanical computers, not 
the first of those we use today.

placed this in an etching bath

COMPUTER PIONEERS 


THE COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE pioneered by 
John von Neumann is basically simple. A single 


memory stores data coming 


from outside and 


from the arithmetic unit that does the computing. 
Instructions and data are retrieved from the same 
memory by the control unit — which sequences 
and decodes instructions — and by output devices 
such as displays. Earlier computers used several 
different architectures, and often worked with 
inefficient decimal arithmetic. 


BEFORE ELECTRONICS 


The idea of a programmable computer goes back to 
British mathematician Charles Babbage’s Analytical 

Engine, conceived in 1834 but never built. The first 
working, nonelectronic computer was built in 1941 


by German engineer Konrad Zuse.

UNCERTAINTY 


IMPROVEMENTS IN information 
technology, and a new understanding 
of the machinery of life, dominated 
the years after 1950. These 
developments were related: scientists 
needed computers to help them map 
human genes. They used them for 
many other discoveries, too. 
Suddenly, we knew almost too much. 
How should we use this knowledge?

he first airbag was patented 

in 1952 by US inventor 
John Hetrick. But it was not 
until 1973, when the rising 
death toll on US roads began to 
cause concern, that General 
Motors developed a practical 
airbag and offered it as an 
option. In spite of consumer 
resistance, and worries about 
deaths caused by early airbags, 
by 1988, most US cars were 
equipped with airbags. European

from fuzzy areas where the

pumped blood out of the body, 
recharged it with oxygen, and 
pumped it back. Modern 
versions are the result of 
decades of development by 
experimenters. Their use in

n February 1953, two men rushed into the 
Eagle, a pub in Cambridge, England. The 
English one, Francis Crick, said that they 
had found the secret of life. The American, 
James Watson, wondered if they really had.

began in 1944, when US immunologist

1949, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff noticed that the amount of A is 
always the same as the amount of T, and likewise for G and C. 

This was all that was known about DNA when biologist James Watson 
arrived at Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in 1951. The Cavendish 
specialized in X-ray analysis of molecular structures, and physicist Francis 
Crick was an expert there. Watson was convinced that unraveling DNA

would be the breakthrough of the century. He needed Crick’s help because 
in the US, the great chemist Linus Pauling was already hot on the trail. 

At King’s College, London, physicist Maurice Wilkins and his assistant, 
Rosalind Franklin, were using X-rays on DNA. Crick and Watson decided 
to do something different. They used Franklin’s X-rays to help them build 
models. The first attempt looked like three spiral staircases. Wilkins and 
Franklin said that Crick and Watson had to think again. All the time, 
Pauling was breathing down their necks. Crick and Watson eventually saw 
a draft diagram of his proposed structure, but they knew it was wrong. 

Watson studied Franklin's latest X-ray picture and became convinced 
that a DNA molecule was spiral, or helical, in shape. He wondered 
whether it could be a double helix, 
rather than the triple helix they

had considered,

suggested that DNAs “backbone” was on the 

outside. Suddenly, Watson saw that T fit with A, 

and C with G, like rungs between the uprights of a 
twisted ladder. It explained 
Chargaff’s observation and, 
more importantly, how DNA 
was copied. He told Crick, and 
that was when they rushed to 

a. the Eagle. 

Watson and Crick were 
worried in case they were mistaken, so they 
raced to build an accurate model. There was 
nothing wrong with it. It was definitely the 
structure of DNA. Later, even Pauling was 
delighted to agree that Crick and Watson had 
indeed found the secret of life.

electrons to become electrically 
charged.) Working in the US, 
German physicist Erwin Miller 
put an extremely sharp metal 
point inside a cathode ray tube

helium at low pressure, and 
subjected it to an electric field. 
Helium around the tip was 
ionized by the stronger field

measurement for things like 
length, mass, force, and

International d’Unités, or SI, 
provides such units. Adopted 
in 1960, SI cleaned up an older 
system called MKS (meter— 
kilogram-second) by defining 
six basic units (plus a seventh 
added in 1971) and deriving all 
the others from them. It also 
standardized the prefixes, such 
as kilo (a thousand) that are 
used to express measurements.

RUBY LASER Flash tubes pumped 


energy into the pale pink ruby rod of

precisely parallel to get laser action. 


Quasar 


Allan Sandage, 
Maarten Schmidt 


uasars are starlike objects. 

They are found in some 
parts of the sky that also give 
out strong radio waves. US 
astronomer Allan Sandage 
found the first in 1960. Its 
spectrum was puzzling. In 
1963 Dutch-born US 
astronomer Maarten Schmidt 
suggested that it was a normal 
spectrum shifted sideways by 
a huge amount. According to 
astronomical theory, this 
showed that the quasar was 
billions of light-years away and 
therefore must be fantastically 
bright. Further observations 
indicated that quasars are also 
quite small, suggesting that 
they are active black holes 
(® see page 184). 


Ruby laser 


Theodore Maiman 


year after it was shown 
that lasers were possible 
(% see page 220), US physicist 
Theodore Maiman made one. 
He used a rod of synthetic 
ruby with silver-coated ends, 
surrounded by flash tubes. 
Light from the tubes excited 
atoms in the rod, making them 
give out light. Trapped 
between the reflecting 
ends, this stimulated 
- further atoms, creating the 
first pulses of laser light.

Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. 
Gagarin’s flight lasted for 
1 hour, 48 minutes. He reached 
a speed of 17,000 mph 
(27,400 km/hr) and a height of 
203 miles (327 km). Gagarin

AS people grow older, 
their hips can wear out. 


The first successful hip

metal ball into the 
top of a patient's 
thigh bone with a

red, green, or blue. Each layer 
contains a dye that absorbs just 
the light to which the layer is 
sensitive. The blue-sensitive 
layer, for example, contains 
yellow dye, which absorbs only 
blue light. Pulling the film out 
of the camera activates it and 
squeezes it into contact with a

in proportion to the exposure 
received, and the remaining 
dye moves into the print. Where 
the subject absorbs blue, for 
example, the blue layer receives 
less exposure, so more of its 
yellow dye reaches the final 
print, making it, too, 
absorb blue. 
The process 
takes just 60 
seconds.

It seemed that even protons 
and neutrons were made 
up of particles, which 
could combine in 
previously unseen 
ways. In 1964, US 
physicist Murray 
Gell-Mann, 
building on 

earlier work 

with Israeli 
physicist 
Yuval Ne’eman, 
proposed a set of 
truly basic particles 
that explained the new

quarks. He and other scientists 
then developed an elaborate, 
and now accepted, theory of 
how they work.

retune their phones to a

Dyson got the idea for his

collect unwanted particles, 
such as the sawdust from 
a sawmill. His challenge 
was to get the principle 

to work on a much 
smaller scale inside 
a domestic machine:

cleaners hadn't changed much since they were 
invented. They worked well only with a new bag, 
because the dust they sucked up from the carpet 
quickly clogged the pores in the bag, reducing 
suction. The bag was like the cloth filter in 
Dyson's factory, which he had replaced with a 
cyclone, and he wondered if he could replace 
the bag with a cyclone system too. 

Dyson rushed home and made a cardboard 
model of the industrial cyclone. He ripped 
the bag off an old vacuum cleaner and 
replaced it with his cardboard cone. To his 
delight, he found that the bagless vacuum 
cleaner worked well. He had made an ‘ 
important invention. 

That was in 1978. It would be another 15 years 
before Dyson’s Dual Cyclone cleaner was launched, 
although his first cyclonic cleaner, the G-Force, featured 


on the cover of Design magazine in 1983 and reached 1940s

he had to manufacture his invention himself. He didn’t

Craig Venter made use of the

first clone from an adult. 


arry Griffin picked up the phone. 

It was the evening of Saturday 
February 22, 1997, and he was enjoying a 
break from the busy Roslin Institute, 
Scotland, where one of his jobs was 
to deal with journalists. The call 
shattered his weekend. Tomorrow, 

a Sunday newspaper was going to 
publish a story that was supposed to be 
kept secret until the following week. 
Scientists at the Institute, collaborating 
with the biotechnology company 

PPL Therapeutics, had created a sheep that was 


an exact copy — a clone — of an adult sheep. 

Lamb 6LL3 — Dolly — had been born in July 1996. Journalists 
tried to figure out what she meant for humanity. Could humans 
now be cloned? Should they be? British genetic engineer Ian 
Wilmut, who led the Dolly team, didn’t think so. He wanted to 
produce sheep that delivered medicines in their milk. If he could 
make one sheep do this, cloning might turn it into a flock. 


A laboratory-grown adult cell is collected. 


A pipette, on the left, holds the nucleus-free egg 
cell in place while the complete adult cell is 
pushed into it by the tube seen on the right. 


Animals had been cloned before, but all 
from cells at an early stage of development. 
As an embryo grows, its cells become 
specialized. Some of them form nerves, 
some form muscles, and so on. The genes 
not needed in any particular type of cell 
are “turned off”. It is this that allows many 
different types of cell to be created from 
just one set of genes. So although every 
adult cell contains every gene, none has all 
its genes available in working form. 

In 1995, another scientist at the Roslin 
Institute, Keith Campbell, had found a way 
to turn back the clock and make an adult 
cell behave like an early embyronic cell. 


1951 — 2014 


The world’s press converged on 
Dolly after Britain’s Observer 
newspaper printed her story on 
Sunday February 23, 1997. 


He kept adult cells alive in culture dishes 
using a medium that contained very little “growth 
factor” — in effect putting them on a starvation diet. This 
starvation turned the genes that had been turned off during 
development back on again. A cell 
treated in this way, because it had a 
full set of genes available for work, 
could, when fused with an egg that 
had had its nucleus removed, form 
the starting point for a new animal. 
Wilmut and his colleagues took 
an egg from a sheep and sucked out 
its genetic material with a tiny tube. 
Then they inserted a “starved” cell 
from the udder of a different sheep. 
A tiny electric shock started the egg 
dividing to produce an embryo. DOLty BECOMES ATION 
They implanted this in the womb of another sheep. They had to do this On April 13, 1998, Dolly

were helped to bond together 
using Bioglass, a ceramic 


material containing silicon, 
calcium, and phosphorus. 
This had been developed in 
the 1960s by British researcher 
Larry Hench. It is now hoped 
that it will be possible to inject 
liquid Bioglass enriched with

A draft of the sequence was 
announced on June 26, 2000, 
by two rivals, the public 
Human Genome Project 
(HGP), led by Francis Collins, 
and the private Celera 
Genomics, led by Craig Venter.

START OF SOMETHING BIG 


THE HUMAN GENOME is only the start of a project 
that could last another century. Scientists will 
use it, among other things, to find connections 


between genes and diseases. 
There will be several areas 
of study. Important among 
these will be functional 
genomics, which is 

about what genes do, 

and structural genomics, 
which deals with the 

shape of the proteins that 
enable them to do it. 


HUMAN GENOME PROJECT 
This international project was 


Dr Craig Venter, former 
president of Celera Genomics 


started in 1990, with the goal of completing it by 2005. 
This was later brought forward to 2003. There are four 
major participants in the US and one in Britain, with 
research centers in at least 18 other countries making 
contributions. Its results are freely published.

More moons

that the planet Jupiter 
has even more moons 
than we thought. Using 
a 140-in (3.6-m) 
telescope atop a 
Hawaiian volcano, they 
discovered 11 new 
satellites. This took the 
total number of Jupiter's 
known satellites up 
to 39 — far more than 
any other planet in the 
solar system. It is 
perhaps a bit of an 
exaggeration to call 
these moons — they are 
not large, round bodies, 
but relatively small, 
irregularly shaped 
lumps of rock 
that were 
captured by
