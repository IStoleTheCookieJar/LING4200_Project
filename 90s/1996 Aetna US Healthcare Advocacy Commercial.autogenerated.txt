I love to work with children because they're so much fun.
They keep you on your toes. Every day is different.
Children have very different health care needs than adults.
U.S. Health Care has allowed us to offer parents the whole spectrum of preventative care that they need for their children.
They have acted as a leader in the areas of immunization and preventative care.
And as a family physician, I think health care should be within everyone's reach.
I love being a family physician. There's nothing else I'd rather do.
