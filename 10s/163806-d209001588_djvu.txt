time  of  such  payment  would  be  entitled  to  receive  royalty  hereunder  if  die  well  was  producing,  or  deposit  to  their  credit  in  U^&Srjyfi&^-^^jT  

Bank  at       '7^0  i  £kr£  Ui^a  f+- UatH*  .IK   (which  bank  as  agent  or  depository  and  its  successors  are 

royalty  owner  or  owners'  agent,  and  shall  continue  as  depository  for  all  such  sums  which  Lessee  may  pay  hereunder  regardless  of  changes  in  ownership  or  royalties)  die 
sum  of  One  and  no/100  Dollar  ®  1 .00)  for  each  calendar  month,  or  portion  thereafter  during  which  said  well  is  situated  on  the  Lease  Premises,  or  on  land  pooled  therewith, 
and  this  Lease  is  not  otherwise  maintained,  or  this  Lease  is  not  released  by  Lessee  as  to  the  land  on  which  or  the  horizon,  zone  or  formation  in  which  the  well  is  completed. 
The  first  payment  of  such  sum ,  shall  be  made  on  or  before  the  first  day  of  each  calendar  month  after  expiration  of  ninety  (90)  days  from  the  date  the  lease  is  not  otherwise 
maintained  for  all  accruals  to  such  date,  and  thereafter  on  or  before  the  first  day  of  each  third  calendar  month  for  all  accruals  to  each  such  date  to  Lessor's  designated

above  or  to  the  last  known  address  provided  in  writing  to  Lessee  by  Lessor.  Lessee's  failure  to  properly  or  timely  pay  or  tender  any  such  sum  as  royalty  shall  render 
Lessee  liabie  for  the  amount  due  but  it  shall  not  operate  to  terminate  this  lease.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary,  Lessee  may  from  time  to  time  withhold  and 
accumulate  such  payments  payable  to  Lessor  until  the  first  of  the  calendar  month  following  the  accumulation  of  Twenty-Five  and  no/100  Dollars  ($25.00)  when  payment

or  subsurface  interval  or  any  depths  thereunder  and  thereby  be  relieved  of  all  obligations  as  to  the  released  land,  mineral,  horizon,  zone  or  formation.  If  mis  Lease  is 
released  as  to  all  minerals,  horizons,  zones  and  formations  under  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  the  shut-in  royalty  and  other  payments  computed  in  accordance  therewith 
shall  thereupon  be  reduced  in  the  proportion  that  die  acreage  released  bears  to  the  acreage  which  was  covered  by  this  Lease  immediately  prior  to  such  release. 

5.  Lessee,  at  its  option,  is  hereby  given  the  right  and  power  during  or  after  the  Primary  Term  while  this  Lease  is  in  effect  to  pool  or  combine  the  Lease  Premises, 
or  any  portion  thereof,  as  to  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals,  or  any  of  them,  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  Lease,  and/or  any  other  land,  lease  or  leases  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  thereof,  when  in  Lessee's  judgment  it  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  do  so  in  order  properly  to  explore,  or  to  develop  and  operate  the  Lease  Premises  in  compliance 
with  the  spacing  rules  of  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas,  or  omer  lawful  aumority,  or  when  to  do  so  would,  m  the  judgment  of  Lessee,  promote  the  conservation  of  oil, 
gas  or  other  mineral  in  and  under  and  that  may  be  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises.  Units  pooled  for  oil  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  40  acres  each  plus  a 
tolerance  of  10%  thereof;  and  units  pooled  for  gas  hereunder  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  160  acres  each  plus  a  tolerance  of  10%  thereof,  provided  that  should 
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  prescribe  or  permit  the  creation  of  units  larger  than  those  specified,  units  thereafter  created  may  conform  substantially  in  size 
with  those  prescribed  or  permitted  by  governmental  regulations.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  stated  herein,  a  unit  for  a  horizontal  well  may  include  (i)  the 
amount  of  acreage  allowed  for  obtaining  a  permit  to  drill  a  well  under  the  spacing  and  density  provisions  in  the  applicable  field  or  statewide  rules  fOT  a  vertical  wellbore, 
plus  the  additional  acreage  listed  in  the  tables  in  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas  Rule  86  (density  greater  than  40  acres),  or  (ii)  the  amount  of  acreage  allowed  for 
obtaining  a  full  production  allowable  under  the  applicable  field  or  statewide  rules  for  a  vertical  wellbore,  plus  the  additional  acreage  listed  in  the  tables  in  the  Railroad 
Commission  of  Texas  Rule  86  (density  greater  than  40  acres).  Lessee  may  pool  or  combine  the  Lease  Premises  or  any  portion  thereof;  as  above  provided  as  to  oil  in  any 
one  or  more  strata  and  as  to  gas  in  any  one  or  more  strata.  Units  formed  by  pooling  as  to  any  stratum  or  strata  need  not  conform  in  size  or  area  with  units  as  to  any  other 
stratum  or  strata,  and  oil  units  need  not  conform  as  to  area  with  gas  units.  Pooling  in  one  or  more  instances  shall  not  exhaust  the  rights  of  Lessee  to  pool  this  Lease  or 
portions  thereof  into  other  units.  Lessee  shall  file  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which  the  Lease  Premises  is  situated  an  instrument  describing  and

option  as  to  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals  before  or  after  commencing  operations  for  or  completing  an  oil  or  gas  well  or  wells  or  mine  for  other  mineral  on  the  Lease  Premises, 
and  the  pooled  unit  may  include,  but  is  not  required  to  include,  land  or  leases  upon  which  a  well  or  mine  capable  of  producing  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities 
has  theretofore  been  completed  or  upon  which  operations  for  drilling  of  a  well  or  mine  for  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  have  theretofore  been  commenced.  Operations  for 
drilling  on,  or  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  from  any  part  of  a  pooled  unit  which  include,  all  or  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  regardless  of  whether  such 
operations  for  drilling  were  commenced  or  such  production  was  secured  before  or  after  the  execution  of  this  Lease  or  the  instrument  designating  die  pooled  unit,  shall  be 
considered  as  operations  for  drilling  on  or  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  from  the  Lease  Premises  whether  or  not  the  well  or  wells  or  mine  be  located  on  the  Lease

a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  is  reclassified  as  an  oil  well,  the  date  of  such  reclassification  shall  be  considered  as  the  date  of  cessation  of  production  for  purposes  of 
applying  the  additional  drilling  and  reworking  provisions  of  Paragraph  6  hereof  as  to  all  leases  any  part  of  which  are  included  in  the  unit  other  than  the  leased  premises  on
