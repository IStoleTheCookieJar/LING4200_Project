Northwest  receives  highest  funding 


by  Jacob  DIPIetre _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Northwest  will  receive  more  money  than  any 
other  four-year  state  school  in  Missouri  from  Gov. 
Mel  Carnahan. 

The  University  received  a  10.1  percent  increase 
over  the  amount  received  last  fiscal  year.  Carnahan 
suggested  Northwest  receive  an  appropriation  of 
more  than  $25  million  total,  which  is  an  increase 
of  just  over  $2  million. 

As  a  large  part  of  the  increases,  $  1 .4  million  will 
be  used  for  Northwest’s  Mission  Enhancement  pro¬ 
posal.  Improving  the  electronic  campus,  imple¬ 
menting  Culture  of  Quality  to  all  aspects  of  the  Uni¬ 
versity  and  developing  an  educational  consortium 
are  all  parts  of  the  proposal. 

Across  the  state,  funds  allotted  to  higher  educa¬ 


tion  are  down.  Sen.  Sam  Graves,  R-Mo.,  said  the  rea¬ 
son  Northwest  received  the  largest  increase  is  in  part 
because  of  the  continuous  lobbying  on  the  part  of 
Graves  and  his  staff  and  University  President  Dean 
Hubbard.  Graves  said  ultimately  the  decision  made 
by  the  governor  is  for  various  factors. 

“I  never  know  for  sure  what  exactly  sways  the 
decision  of  allocating  the  money,”  Graves  said.  “I’ve 
complained  for  a  long  time  that  Northwest  gets  the 
short  end  of  the  deal  come  budget  time;  I  was  tickled 
to  see  this  turnaround  in  this  year’s  budget.” 

Hubbard  said  Northwest  received  the  desired 
amount  of  funds. 

“Initially  we  had  asked  for  the  money  over  three 
years,”  he  said.  “The  governor  gave  us  everything 
we  asked  for,  but  he  spread  it  over  four  years.” 

Hubbard  said  the  extra  year  is  not  a  problem  and 
the  University  is  willing  to  work  with  the  state. 


“Personally  I  feel  good  about  that,”  Hubbanj 
said.  “I  want  to  go  on  record  expressing  apprecia¬ 
tion  for  the  support  we  are  getting  from  both  the 
coordinating  board  and  the  governor.” 

While  Northwest  did  receive  an  increase  from 
last  year,  there  is  still  not  enough  money  for  cer¬ 
tain  projects.  Hubbard  said  Carnahan  did  not  agree 
with  the  Coordinating  Board  of  Higher  Education 
“On  just  simple  operating  of  the  University, 
higher  education  in  general  got  less  then  25  per¬ 
cent  of  what  the  board  recommended,”  he  said. 

Because  of  the  decrease  in  funds,  some  concerns 
have  been  raised  about  the  amount  of  renovations 
being  done  and  the  different  programs  on  campus. 
One  of  these  concerns  deals  with  faculty  salaries. 

Hubbard  said  faculty  members  might  not  receive 
what  they  want  now,  but  the  future  of  the  Univer¬ 
sity  is  more  important  than  their  immediate  needs. 


“I  know  people  on  campus  arc  not  going  to  be 
excited  about  the  prospect  of  not  having  a  lot  of 
money  that  will  go  into  salaries  this  year,”  Hubbard 
said.  “But  the  future  well-being  of  this  institution 
has  to  be  more  important  to  us  then  the  immediate 
portion  of  the  budget  that  can  go  into  salaries.” 

Along  with  salaries,  concern  has  been  mentioned 
about  the  amount  of  renovations.  Hubbard  said  the 
money  for  renovations  comes  from  a  different  bud¬ 
get  and  will  continue  as  planned,  except  Garrett- 
Strong  which  will  be  delayed  for  at  least  a  year. 

“This  is  operating  money  the  renovations  are 
(paid  for)  capital  dollars,  that’s  another  fund,” 
Hubbard  said.  “This  year  we  got  $9.6  million,  next 
year  we  won’t  get  any.” 

Hubbard  said  the  reason  the  University  is  not 
getting  money  for  renovations  next  year  is  that  the 
state  will  channel  more  money  into  the  prisons.

'  Golf  proposal 
.  dies  at  Council 

by  Ruby  Dittmer  _ 


Community  News  Editor 

A  proposal  for  the  construction  of  a  golf  cart  storage  shed  at  Mozingo 
Lake  died  because  of  a  lack  of  a  second  motion  at  Wednesday  night’s 
Maryville  City  Council  meeting. 

Councilman  Bob  Huffman  presented  the  Council  with  the  proposal 

*  which  he,  and  City  Manager  David  Angerer  constructed.  The  proposed 
building  would  have  been  50  feet  by  99  feet  and  would  have  housed  64 
private  carts  and  an  additional  40  rental  carts.  Those  who  rented  space 
in  the  cart  shed  would  have  been  required  to  purchase  a  season  pass  for 
the  golf  course. 

Councilwoman  Bridget  Brown  opposed  the  shed  proposal  saying  it 
presented  a  risk.  She  also  said  the  city  has  an  obligation  to  taxpayers  to 
maintain  the  use  of  the  facility  at  a  high  level  while  maintaining  the 

,  revenue  at  the  same  high  level. 

Councilman  Dale  Mathes’s  main  concern  was  the  “total  project  that 
we  promised  the  people.”  Mathes  said  the  city  told  the  people  other 
projects  and  areas  in  the  park  would  also  be  developed  as  well  as  the 
golf  course. 

“We  promised  a  total  picture,”  Mathes  said.  “And  we’ve  got  to  keep 
focused  on  the  total  picture.”  . 

Some  members  of  the  community  were  not  pleased  with  the  Council’s 
decision. 

^  “I’m  surprised  .the  city  would  rather  sell  individual  fees  rather  than 
season  passes,”  local  resident  Mike  Foster  said. 

Huffman  was  also  disappointed  but  said  he  will  try  to  pass  a  similar 
proposal  in  the  future.  He  believed  there  were  two  other  Council  mem¬ 
bers  who  supported  the  proposal. 

Huffman  said  he  cannot  see  the  half-cent  tax  used  for  funding  the 
Mozingo  project  passing  again  without  the  storage  shed. 

“The  golfers  of  the  city  passed  the  tax  the  first  time,”  Huffman  said. 

In  other  news,  the  Rotary  Club  of  Mary  ville  proposed  to  build  a  bath- 

*  house  complete  with  showers  and  washers  and  dryers  at  the  Mozingo 
Lake  area.  The  club  asked  the  city  to  build  the  bathhouse  and  the  club

About  three  years  ago,  McGary  re¬ 
tired  to  spend  time  with  her  children. 
The  Humane  Society  asked  her  to 
take  over  the  volunteer  position  of 
president  since  she  had  worked  for 
them  in  the  past. 

Part  of  the  reason  McGary  be¬

mistreatment  of  animals  that  she  had 
seen  while  working  as  a  veterinary

"You  would  be  shocked," 
McGary  said.  “The  neglect  is  unbe¬

Max  Ruhl  was  appointed  dean  of  the 
University’s  College  of  Education  and  Hu¬ 
man  Services  by  the  Board  of  Regents  Jan. 
22. 

Prior  to  his  promotion,  Ruhl  served  as 
chairman  of  the  Department  of  Educational 
Leadership  for  seven  years. 

He  replaced  Joe  Ryan,  who  resigned 
Dec.  31  after  11  years  as  dean.  Ryan 
teaches  foreign  language  education  classes. 

“I  really  have  to  commend  my  prede¬ 
cessor,”  Ruhl  said.  “He  is  leaving  the  col¬ 
lege  in  a  strong  position.  He  showed  strong 
leadership  for  many  years.” 

Ruhl  will  have  a  variety  of  responsibili¬ 
ties  in  his  new  position.  The  College  of 
Education  and  Human  Services  includes 
the  departments  of  Educational  Leadership; 
Curriculum  and  Instruction;  Health,  Physi¬ 


cal  Education,  Recreation  and  Dance;  Psy¬ 
chology,  Sociology  and  Counseling;  and 
Human  Environmental  Sciences. 

“I’m  excited  to  be  working  with  a  ter¬ 
rific,  talented,  committed,  hard-working 
faculty,”  Ruhl  said.  “I  have  great  optimism 
for  the  things  we  are  going  to  accomplish.” 

Ruhl  will  hold  a  meeting  for  the  staff  to 
discuss  long-term  goals. 

“I’d  like  to  focus  their  attention  on 
teaching,”  he  said.  “They  have  a  lot  of  other 
responsibilities,  but  teaching  is  the  most 
important  and  deserves  the  most  time." 

Ruhl  plans  to  make  sure  the  faculty 
doesn’t  fall  behind. 

“I  will  focus  on  aggressive  staff  devel¬ 
opment,"  he  said.  “We  need  to  continue  to 
train  them  to  be  aware  of  the  latest  issues 
and  trends  in  teaching.” 

Ruhl  thinks  the  students  will  benefit  by 
using  the  latest  technologies  available. 

“The  students  should  have  as  many  op¬ 


portunities  as  we  can  give  them,”  Ruhl  said. 
“We  need  to  prepare  them  for  multimedia 
teaching.” 

He  said  that  he  would  also  like  to  in¬ 
crease  the  number  of  students  who  are 
placed  in  diverse  settings  for  student  teach¬ 
ing. 

“We  are  preparing  students  for  class¬ 
rooms  across  America,”  Ruhl  said.  “They 
need  to  know  how  to  handle  all  ranges  of 
students.” 

He  plans  on  congratulating  faculty  and 
students  when  they  do  well. 

“I  want  us  to  celebrate  the  success  of 
the  students  and  faculty,”  Ruhl  said.  “They 
need  to  recognize  that  good  things  come 
from  hard  work." 

The  Department  of  Educational  Lead¬ 
ership  conducted  an  internal  search  to  fill 
Ruhl’s  past  position  as  chair.  As  dean  of 
the  college,  Ruhl  will  make  the  final  deci¬ 
sion.

problems. 

"Everything  I  do  is  as  a  member 
of  a  team,"  McGary  said.  “We  all 
have  our  areas  of  expertise  and  we 
work  together  for  a  positive  benefit.” 

The  Maryville  animal  shelter  was 
operated  by  the  city  before  the  Hu¬ 
mane  Society  took  over  the  manage¬ 
ment  and  operations. 

McGary  said  even  though  there 
are  many  contributors,  it  is  surpris¬ 
ing  how  much  money  is  needed  for 
the  upkeep  of  the  shelter. 

"I  feel  extremely  responsible  for 
all  of  the  money  spent  because  the 
funds  we  receive  come  out  of  the 
goodness  of  people’s  hearts,  dona¬ 
tions,  annual  dues,  fund-raisers  and 
the  city  of  Maryville  and  Nodaway 
County,"  McGary  said.  "The  city  has 


helping  educate  public  been  extremely  cooperative  and  sup- 
schools  and  providing  indi-  portive.” 


Though  pending  Regents  OK, 
University  plans  to  start  next 
evolution  of  computer  program 

by  Scott  Summers _ 

Chief  Reporter 

“We  are  in  the  process  of  looking  at  the 
options  we  have,"  provost  Tim  Gilmour,  said. 

Even  though  final  decisions  about  the  EC+ 
program  are  still  pending,  EC+  will  not  con¬ 
tinue  in  the  same  facet  that  it  has  over  the  last 
two  years. 

The  Board  of  Regents  will  discuss  the  pro¬ 
gram  during  its  February  meeting  and  debate 
what  changes  will  be  made. 

Gilmour  said  if  the  new  program  is  ap¬ 
proved  by  the  Board  of  Regents,  the  Univer¬ 
sity  would  not  abandon  the  students  who  have 
already  purchased  the  notebook  computers. 

"We  would  do  everything  we  can  to  main¬ 
tain  our  commitment  to  those  students," 
Gilmour  said.  “That  includes  offering  some 
courses  in  an  EC+  mode,  and  we  may  do  some 
other  things.” 

Northwest  will  continue  to  have  the  objec¬ 
tive  of  getting  technology  into  the  classrooms 
and  giving  students  a  chance  to  utilize  that 
technology. 

Douglas  Martin,  assistant  professor  of  psy¬ 
chology,  sociology  and  counseling,  said  EC+ 


was  a  very  beneficial  program  to  the  students 
and  teachers  involved. 

“I  liked  using  the  computers  in  my  class¬ 
room,"  he  said.  “It  helps  the  teaching  process.” 

Gilmour  said  the  University  will  continue 
to  put  teacher  stations  in  the  classrooms  and  it 
is  discussing  the  idea  of  creating  a  center  for 
the  development  of  applications. 

"We  will  continue  our  program  to  supply 
all  of  our  faculty  over  time  with  notebook  com¬ 
puters  to  use  in  the  classroom  and  outside  of 
the  classroom,”  Gilmour  said. 

EC+  is  still  a  great  concept,  Gilmour  said, 
but  the  Board  of  Regents  is  looking  for  ways 
to  make  it  more  accessible, 

"The  major  shortcoming  of  EC+  was  the 
cost,”  Gilmour  said.  "What  svc’re  doing  is 
evolving  the  program  into  something  that  will 
serve  more  students  and,  frankly,  is  a  little  bit 
more  cost  effective.” 

Martin  believes  if  EC+  is  sinking,  it  may 
be  because  Northwest  was  trying  to  bring  the 
program  along  too  fast. 

"I  think  perhaps  we  were  a  little  ahead  of 
our  lime,"  Martin  said.  "Over  time  (the  note¬ 
book  computers)  might  get  as  inexpensive  as 
a  pocket  calculator." 

If  the  prices  continue  to  drop  over  time, 
Martin  thinks  more  students  would  be  willing

OFTHE CAMPUS 


Food  prices  on  campus 
are  still  very  expensive 


After  the  holiday  season,  most 
people  are  checking  their  budgets  and 
counting  every  last  penny  just  to  make 
ends  meet. 

For  some  commuting  students  this 
is  not  the  only  time  money  is  tight, 
because  paying  for  food  on  campus 
has  many  eating  and  spending  spar¬ 
ingly. 

Only  $200  is  allotted  on  a 
commuter’s  food  plan.  For  many 
commuters,  money  runs  out 
quickly  and  it  seems  this  is 
mostly  the  result  of  high  ^ 

food  prices  or  not  enough 
money  on  the  plan. 

For  a  simple  meal, 
consisting  of  a  sandwich 
and  drink,  one  spends 
around  $5  —  about  the 
same  as  a  meal  eating  out.  It 
is  often  a  lot  cheaper  to  go 
home  and  make  a  sandwich, 
but  for  some  students  who 
have  to  be  on  campus  all 
day,  this  simply  isn’t  feasible. 

Students  with  regular  meal  plans 
often  end  up  with  extra  money  at  the 
end  of  the  semester.  Why  is  it  that 
commuters  have  so  much  trouble 
making  meal  money  last? 

A  single  piece  of  fruit  costs  $.60, 
whereas  one  can  buy  at  least  five  at 
the  grocery  store  for  the  same  price.  A 
12-ounce  bottle  of  water  costs  a 
dollar,  at  the  store,  a  gallon  of  distilled 
water  costs  $.73.  A  Rice  Crispy  treat 
is  over  a  dollar,  and  a  pan  of  them  at 
home  costs  less  and  lasts  longer. 


A  croissant  box  containing  carrots, 
grapes  and  a  sandwich  costs  $3.90, 
which  is  more  than  an  extra  value  meal 
at  McDonald’s  and  it  doesn’t  come 
with  a  drink.  Two  bagels  and  a  con¬ 
tainer  of  cream  cheese  cost  $3.50,  and 
to  many  students  these  prices  seem 
outragous. 

Campus  Dining  has  valid  reasons 
for  the  costs.  It  seems  much  of  the  cost 
comes  from  prices  of  equipment  such 
as  dish  washers  and  the  price  of  labor. 

Prices  are  competitive  with 
4*^*  local  fast-food  restaurants. 

”  '  For  instance,  a  32-ounce 

drink  is  $.10  cheaper  on 
campus  than  at  McDonald’s 
or  Hardee’s. 

But  for  those  who  would 
rather  eat  at  home,  feel  free  to 
do  so.  If  time  does  not  permit 
a  trip  home,  and  you  are 
forced  to  eat  on  campus,  the 
prices  are  as  they  stand. 

Campus  Dining  is  willing 
to  hear  the  complaints  of  the  con¬ 
cerned.  If  students  want  change,  they 
must  go  through  the  proper  channels. 
Contact  Campus  Dining  and  make  an 
appointment  to  discuss  your  concerns 
with  them,  or  join  the  Campus  Dining 
Committee  of  the  Residence  Hall 
Association.  Make  your  voice  heard 
where  it  will  count,  or  stop  complain¬ 
ing. 

Though  it  seems  there  is  no  solution 
for  the  pricing  problem,  some  more 
effort  to  attempt  to  find  a  common 
ground  would  be  appreciated.

will  be  its  lucky  number. 

Unfortunately,  this  bond  issue, 
even  armed  with  a  difference  over  the 
last  six,  will  need  all  the  luck  it  can 
find  in  order  to  be  passed. 

First  things  first:  The 
Board  recently  changed  the 
location  of  the  proposed  | 

middle  school  after  enduring  | 

many  residents’  complaints.  | 

Instead  of  the  much-ma-  jgm 

ligned  piece  of  land  adjacent  ||ljf 

to  the  University  on  the  | 

northwest  side  of  town,  the  Mjjlf. . 

proposed  middle  school 
would  be  built  on  a  30-acre 
lot  southeast  of  the  high  school. 

This  change  is  an  attempt  to  offset 
voter  complaints  that  having  a  school 
near  the  college  would  not  be  acces¬ 
sible  to  students,  or  that  college 
students  could  prove  to  be  a  bad 
influence  on  the  school  children. 

In  addition,  the  new  site  will  prove 
beneficial  for  both  students  and 
parents  because  transportation  and 
bussing  will  be  more  convenient. 

A  survey  conducted  in  August 
showed  that  nearly  50  percent  of 
respondents  thought  the  old  site  was 
unacceptable.  In  changing  sites,  the 
Board  has  at  least  taken  one  argument 
away  from  voters. 

However,  the  new  location  may  not 
be  the  solution  that  will  change  the

GEE,  THESE  PRICES  ARE  SO  HIGH,  THEY’RE 
STARTING  TO  ATTRACT  THE  RITZY  CROWD 


Mvfum 

Intersection  should  signal  change 


Lonelle  R. 
Rathje 

Some 
drivers  on 
Highway  71 
have  a 
pure 
disregard 
for 

defensive 

driving 


The  sun  was  beginning  its  timid 
peck  through  the  clouds  as  I  was 
enjoying  a  calm,  serene  winter  day. 
Even  George  Strait,  as  I  recall,  was 
singing  me  a  song  on  the  car  radio. 

God  bless  George. 

The  day  had  the  typical  winter 
components:  Slush,  cool  tempera¬ 
tures  and  the  like  —  even  a  slow 
farmer  in  a  red  truck. 

To  be  specific,  it  was  a  1996 
Chevy. 

Nonetheless,  it  was  Dec.  27,  and  I 
was  slowly  edging  out  of  my  scenic, 
two-story  hillbilly  residence  on 
North  Dewey. 

Dodge  never  intended  Lonelle’s 
Daytona  to  brave  the  rough  and 
tough  Missouri  winters;  however,  it 
was  pulling  through  like  a  trooper. 

And  Lonelle  was  likewise  being  a 
trooper  —  driving  carefully,  as 
always,  to  the  malls  to  tackle  the 
onslaught  of  post-festive  shoppers. 

Armed  with  monetary  supple¬ 
ments  and  an  optimistic  attitude  that 
I  would  indeed  find  the  perfect  safe,  I 
graced  the  U.S.  Hwy.  71  bypass  and 
headed  south  to  the  greatness  of 
Kansas  City. 

Greatness  was  my  quest;  however, 
near  terror  was  what  I  found. 

For  the  record,  the  posted  speed 
limit  is  60  mph  along  the  bypass. 
Lonelle  was  traveling  a  steady  50 
mph  Inclement  weather  conditions, 
as  calm  as  they  were  that  day,  should 
still  signal  caution  for  any  driver  — 
regardless  of  how  well  drivers 
believe  their  vehicles  handle. 

Then  it  happened  —  right  at  the 


Hwy.  71  intersection  by  Kawasaki. 

Aq  event  that  was  to  place  my  world 
into  a  two-second  tailspin. 

I  always  slow  down  when  I 
approach  this  intersection,  as  I  had 
done  on  this  occasion.  Time  after  time 
I  have  seen  too  many  “defenseless” 
drivers  turn  onto  Business  71  with 
pure  disregard  for  the  southbound 
traffic. 

Whether  drivers  turning  onto 
Business  71  have  no  concept  of  just 
how  close  oncoming  traffic  can  reach 
them,  I  have  no  idea. 

However,  I  do  know  this:  The  ’96 
Chevy  sat  in  the  turning  lane  for 
several  seconds,  watched  as  I 
approached,  turned  toward  Business 
7 1  and  then  stopped  in  my  lane  —  as 
if  he  just  saw  me  and  didn’t  know 
what  to  do.  I  was  within  two  yards  of 
hitting  him  before  he. sped  up  and 
onto  Business  71. 

My  driving  excursion  to  my  post- 
festive  shopping  was  suddenly 
scarred. 

By  the  time  I  slammed  on  my 
brakes,  it  was  a  near  hit.  My  car 
entered  into  the  world  of  spinning 
360s  and  settled  to  a  stop  in  the 
middle  of  the  intersection. 

Where  was  the  red  Chevy?  Off  on 
his  merry  way  into  the  ’Ville. 

I’m  quite  aware  I  sound  bitter 
about  this,  particularly  when  there 
was  no  property  damage  or  injury 
involved. 

However,  what  makes  me  bitter  is 
that  I  see  potential  accidents  at  that 
intersection  frequently.  Not  tailspins 
like  mine,  but  the  speed  misjudgment 


of  oncoming  traffic. 

Maryville  Public  Safety  said  the 
intersection  sustained  only  eight 
accidents  since  the  bypass  opened 
in  1994  —  none  of  which  proved 
deadly.  On  average,  15-25  acci¬ 
dents  happen  per  month  within  the 
city  limits. 

In  light  of  the  latter,  the  eight 
sounds  miniscule.  However  when 
speed  is  taken  into  consideration  — 
highway  speed  compared  to  the 
speed  in  town  —  the  intersection 
could  prove  deadly  if  drivers  do  not 
exercise  caution. 

Lonelle’s  solution?  Not  signal 
lights  at  that  intersection,  but  a 
flashing  caution  light. 

A  spokesperson  from  the 
Missouri  Department  of  Transpor¬ 
tation  said  general  criteria  it  takes  » 
into  consideration  when  placing 
traffic  lights  is  not  only  the  amount 
of  traffic,  but  also  the  traffic 
turning  movements.  Individuals,  as 
well  as  cities,  are  welcome  to  voice 
road  concerns  to  the  department  for 
further  investigation. 

My  first  inclination  was  to  voice 
my  opinion  about  placing  signal 
lights  at  the  intersection,  however, 
after  the  transportation  department 
said  such  lights  placed  on  roads 
where  drivers  would  not  expect  to 
see  them  would  be  a  safety  hazard. 

In  essence,  must  we  wait  for  a 
deadly  accident  to  occur  before  we 
enact  change?

Motherly  advice  rings  true  for  freshman 


John 

Klzllarmut 

Never 
turn  your 
cheek  to  a 
mom-ism 


I  was  never  one  to  listen  to  my 
parents.  When  my  mother  told  me, 
“college  is  going  to  take  some 
getting  used  to,”  I  blew  it  off  as  just 
another  mom-ism.  You  know,  like  . 
“your  face  will  stick  that  way,”  or 
“try  it,  you’ll  like  it.” 

Well,  I  still  don’t  eat  brussels 
sprouts,  and  luckily,  my  face  didn’t 
stick  that  way. 

However,  on  my  way  to  class, 
one  of  mom’s  predictions  finally 
came  true. 

Dressed  in  enough  clothing  to 
hold  a  garage  sale,  I  headed  off  to 
the  Fine  Arts  building.  Being  careful 
to  avoid  the  many  dangers  of  the 
newly  funded  Northwest  tractor  pull, 
I  held  my  breath  to  not  inhale  any  of 
the  greenish  gas.  It  has  been  rumored 
to  impair  your  reproductive 
abilities.Suddenly,  as  my  vision  was 
restored,  I  realized  that  mom  was 
right  —  college  is  an  adjustment. 


By  now,  most  of  us  are  fully 
adjusted  (or  re-adjusted)  to  the  odd 
hours  and  the  new  food  groups  that 
are  related  to  college  life. 

However,  there  are  a  few  things 
about  home  I  have  been  taking  for 
granted. 

First  of  all,  not  all  of  the  dishes  are 
crescented  with  the  Bearcat  emblem, 
there  is  room  in  my  fridge  for  a  whole 
gallon  of  milk. and  my  coffeepot 
makes  fresh,  hot  coffee. 

There  are  more  than  two  outlets  in 
my  house.  In  fact,  there  are  more 
outlets  in  the  kitchen  alone.  The  water 
is  fresh  and  clear,  and  tastes  like, 
water. 

Speaking  of  water,  when  I  take  a 
shower  at  home,  there  is  not  the 
slightest  chance  of  boiling  hot  water 
to  suddenly  come  out  of  the  shower 
head  with  absolutely  no  warnii^.  I 
really  miss  that. 

About  the  bathroom,  I  have  never 


had  to  revive  a  drunken,  vomiting 
teenager  who  has  nearly  died  while 
blowing  bubbles  in  my  toilet  for 
three  hours  so  that  I  can  use  it. 

Lastly,  I  really  miss  my  front 
lawn.  Who  would  have  thought  that 
a  bunch  of  green  grass  could  have 
such  sentimental  value.  But  my 
front  lawn  is  special  —  it  still  has 
its  virginity. 

It  has  never  seen  a  whole  case  of 
empty  beer  cans,  or  smelled  of  cow 
feces.  It  is  just  fresh,  green,  happy 
grass,  resting  comfortably  under  a 
fluffy  winter  blanket. 

Well,  mom,  this  time  you  were 
right.  Feel  free  to  come  down  to 
tell  me  “I  told  you  so.”  You  can 
find  me  on  ice  skates,  headed  past 
the  library  on  my  way  to  another 
class.

Headline  misleads 


Dear  editor, 

Your  story  that  you  tilled  “Hit 
and  run  victim  suffers  head  in¬ 
jury"  is  misleading  to  your  read¬ 
ers.  When  you  title  it  “hit  and  run” 
readers  will  think  that  the  driver 
left  the  scene  of  the  accident, 
which  was  not  the  case.  1  think 
that  you  should  be  more  careful 
in  your  choice  of  wording  for  your 
headlines,  so  that  you  are  not  mis¬ 
leading  you  readers.

Atmosphere  upsets 

Dear  editor, 

I  wanted  to  comment  on  the  at¬ 
mosphere  of  a  certain  place  in 
Maryville,  that  being  the  Leaded 
Bean.  My  cousin  attended  North¬ 
west  two  semesters  ago  and  told 
me  about  a  great  place  called 
Gourmet  Pleasures.  He  suggested 
I  go  because  it  was  a  nice  place 
*lo  meet  up  with  friends,  do  some 
studying  or  listen  to  good  music 


such  as  Toni  Braxton,  Seal,  Ma¬ 
donna  and  other  artists. 

Instead,  when  I  got  here  last 
semester,  all  I  found  when  1 
walked  into  the  Leaded  Bean  was 
that  1  was  being  judged  because  1 
represent  a  “normal”  looking  and 
acting  customer.  There  never 
seems  to  be  anyone  who  will 
come  up  to  me  and  start  a  con¬ 
versation  or  ask  to  play  a  game. 
This  is  sure  different  from  other 
coffeehouses  which  have  been  a 
lot  friendlier.  Perhaps  Maryville 
should  reconsider  having  such  an 
establishment  if  it  isn’t  going  to 
he  offered  right,  or  if  the  town 
isn’t  going  to  offer  an  alternative 
to  the  "grunge"  scene.

Partying  does  not  need  alcoholic  ingredients 


Bridget 
_ Brown 

Recent 
summons 
shows 
lack  of 
responsibility 


Over  a  year  ago,  after  much  discussion 
and  with  a  great  deal  of  participation,  the 
City  Council  made  it  illegal  for  anyone 
under  the  age  19  to  be  on  the  premises  of 
a  business  whose  major  source  of  revenue 
was  the  sale  of  alcohol.  Generally  this 
compromise  decision  met  with  approval 
of  a  wide  range  of  residents.  Naive  as  it 
may  seem  to  some  of  you,  I  accepted  the 
input  of  students  under  the  age  of  2 1  who 
pleaded  that  they  had  no  intention  of 
breaking  the  law  by  drinking  underage, 
but  wished  to  “be  with  friends.”  Bar 
owners  of  some  of  your  favorite  places 
have  taken  the  law  and  its  consequences 
seriously.  I  hope  you  are  doing  the  same. 

Recently  there  were  a  number  of 
summons  issued  to  persons  under  the  age 
of  19  in  local  bars.  Is  that  grumbling  I 
hear?  “Not  fair.  There’s  nothing  else  to  do. 
We  can’t  have  house  parties.” 

A.)  Life  is  not  fair.  B.)  Get  a  life. 


There’s  more  life  than  a  local  tavern.  C.) 
House  parties  can  happen  quite  legally 
with  no  alcohol  and  no  disturbing  the 
peace.  Some  of  the  same  people  who  told 
me  as  we  were  deciding  this  issue  they  just 
wanted  to  hang  out  with  their  friends,  not 
break  the  law  were  also  the  ones  saying, 
“Hey,  without  alcohol  there  is  no  party.” 

Risking  serving  up  a  sermon  I  ask  you 
to  look  around  and  sec  the  destruction  of 
lives  the  abuse  of  alcohol  is  causing-You 
may  not  have  to  look  as  far  away  as  you 
think.  My  cooperation  is  giving  any  of  you 
a  head  start  in  the  land  of  irresponsibility  is 
not  an  intentional  one. 

Please  respect  the  law,  be  responsible 
enough  to  do  what  you  are  asked.  Be  19  or 
20  before  you  visit  the  bars  to  hang  with 
your  friends  and  do  not  drink  until  you  are 
of  the  legal  age.  Do  not  blame  the  bar 
owners  or  the  police  for  you  getting  caught 
breaking  the  law.  Responsibility  begins 


right  here  with  the  letter  “I.”  The  bar  owner 
keeping  you  out  becomes  unpopular  and 
the  one  letting  you  in  becomes  popular 
when  you  blame  him  for  your  choice  to 
break  the  law  and  pay  the  fines.  That  bar 
owner  risks  more  than  popularity.  They  risk 
losing  the  right  to  do  business  with 
anybody  at  all. 

If  each  of  us  makes  ethical  choices,  we 
contribute  to  greater  freedom  by  restricting 
ourselves  rather  than  begging  external 
restriction.  There  are  so  many  ways  you 
can  and  will  test  your  wings  in  these 
college  years.  I  hope  your  thirst  for 
changing  the  world  you  have  inherited 
extends  to  more  significant  issues  than  this 
one.  Pick  your  challenges  to  law  carefully, 
not  by  breaking  the  law  but  by  changing  it 
or  choosing  to  obey  it. 

Bridget  Brown  la  the  mayor  pro-tem  of  the  Maryville 
City  Council.

As 

Valentine’s 

Day 

approaches, 
watch  out 
for  Cupid’s 
arrow 


It’s  that  time  of  the  year  when  Cupid 
starts  madly  snapping  his  love  arrows  at 
couples  around  the  world,  pursuing  his 
goal  to  make  people  “fall  in  love.”  But  are 
you  prepared  for  this  Valentine’s  Day? 

I  know  what  some  of  you  are  thinking. 
You’ve  watched  Cupid’s  arrow  zip  past 
you  and  hit  someone  else  and  wonder  if 
this  Valentine’s  will  be  any  different  from 
the  rest.  Well,  don’t  get  discouraged.  I’ve 
seen  Cupid  mistakenly  miss  me  too.  But 
after  being  hit  hard  with  one  of  his  love 
arrows  this  year,  I  believe  that  there  is 
hope  for  everyone. 

However,  poor  Cupid  may  be  thinking 
otherwise.  I  mean,  look  at  how  the  world 
deals  with  love  and  the  opposite  sex. 
We’ve  even  got  books  telling  us  how  to 
understand  each  other,  how  to  fall  in  love 
or  how  to  build  a  lasting  relationship. 

Let’s  be  rational  —  we  will  NEVER 
understand  the  opposite  sex.  Instead,  we 
need  to  just  accept  how  the  other  acts  and 
feels,  without  getting  aggravated. 

Sometimes  love  just  doesn’t  work  out 
or  it  just  wasn’t  with  the  right  person. 
Don’t  blame  it  on  Cupid,  even  he  makes 
mistakes. 

Another  possibility  is  the  one  miracu¬ 
lous  feat  that  everyone  claims  is  infeasible 
—  Love  at  first  sight.  Your  eyes  met  and 
then  you  unbelievably  heard  yourself  say, 
“I’m  not  ready  to  get  involved”  or  “my 
life  is  too  busy  for  love.”  Needless  to  say, 
Cupid  has  his  work  cut  out  for  him  this 
year.  Now  that  planners  are  found  in  every 
school  bag  and  briefcase,  society 
shouldn’t  have  any,  problem  writing  in  a 
time  to  fall  in  love.  Chill  out  everyone. 

It  was  during  the  third  century  when 
Christianity  was  being  persecuted  that 


Roman  Emperor  Claudius  II  outlawed 
marriage,  claiming  it  decreased  a  young 
soldier’s  desire  for  war.  Despite  the 
emperor’s  decree,  a  priest  and  physician  by 
the  name  of  Valentine  secretly  continued  to 
unite  couples  in  holy  matrimony.  On  Feb. 
14,  Valentine  was  beheaded  for  his 
compassion  and  commitment  to  Christian¬ 
ity  and  young  love.  According  to  legend, 
lovers  around  the  world  have  been  cel¬ 
ebrating  the  memory  of  Valentine  ever 
since  and  it’s  about  time  that  we  do  the 
same. 

Like  Christmas,  we’re  forgetting  the 
true  meaning  of  the  holiday.  Valentine’s 
Day  isn’t  about  gifts,  it’s  about  telling  your 
boyfriend,  girlfriend,  family,  friends  and 
maybe  even  your  dog  that  you  love  them. 
Although  roses,  candy,  love  letters  and 
even  diamonds  (go  get’em  girls)  are  great 
to  get. 

Remember  how  easy  it  was  to  like 
someone  in  grade  school?  I  would  do 
anything  to  go  back  to  the  second  grade 
where  we  made  valentine  card  holders  out 
of  old  shoe  boxes  and  all  week  we  would 
secretly  slip  Batman  or  Barbie  valentines 
into  someone’s  box.  Exhilaration  and  a 
sugar  high  would  rush  through  me  as  I 
would  rip  open  the  cards  one  by  one  during 
our  Valentine’s  Day  party. 

“You’re  out  of  this  world  Valentine”  or 
“Will  you  be  my  Valentine?”  piled  up  on 
my  desk.  If  I  was  really  lucky,  I  would  get 
at  least  one  card  from  a  boy  that  said  “I 
like  shooting  rubber  bands  at  you”  on  the 
back.  Those  were  always  my  favorite 
because  my  mother  said  when  a  boy  picked 
on  you,  that’s  when  he  really  liked  you. 

Oh,  how  love  used  to  be  so  easy  and 
cute.  Now  that  we  are  older  it’s  more 


difficult  to  get  excited  about  opening  a  card 
or  falling  in  love.  Insecurity,  fear  and  a 
painful  past  keep  us  from  falling  head  over 
heels  in  love  with  somebody.  All  three  of 
these  elements  kept  me  from  getting 
involved  in  the  past.  If  it  wasn’t  for  them  I 
wouldn’t  have  fallen  in  love  with  who  I’m 
with  now.  After  a  year  of  learning  to 
understand  and  put  up  with  my  ever-so- 
changing  hormones  and  allowing  me  to 
accept  the  idea  that  someone  can  love  me,  I 
realized  that  all  along  I  was  just  meeting 
the  wrong  guys. 

I  believe  there’s  someone  out  there  for 
everyone.  Someone  who  will  forgive  you 
countless  of  times  and  never  remind  you  of 
it,  who  is  always  concerning  themselves 
with  your  happiness  and  who  only  wants  to 
share  every  minute  of  his  or  her  life  with 
you. 

For  some  of  you  like  myself  that  have 
found  that  special  someone,  don’t  ever  let 
them  go  and  let  them  know  this  February 
14  just  how  much  you  love  them. 

Maybe  take  this  day  to  give  mom  and 
dad  or  grandma  and  grandpa  a  call  just  to 
say  I  love  you  or  look  back  on  the  things 
you’ve  taken  for  granted  in  the  past  and 
find  it  in  your  heart  to  start  believing  in 
love,  family  and  God  again. 

As  part  of  a  poem  from  an  anonymous 
writer  said  “To  believe  is  to  embrace  the 
value  of  a  nurturing  heart,  the  innocence  of 
a  child’s  eyes  and  the  beauty  of  an  aging 
.  hand,  fo*r  it  is  thought  their  teachings  we 
learn  how  to  love.” 

I  love  you  all  and  have  a  Happy  -  '  • 
Valentine’s  Day.

How  will  the  location  for  the  new  school  site  affect  your  vote  on  April  1? 


“I  don’t  think 
the  new 
location  will 
make  that  big 
of  difference 
because  the 
fact  remains 
that  the  people 
of  Maryville 
don’t  want  to 
pay  more 
taxes.” 

Steve  Welbleun, 
Maryville 
resident 


“I  don’t  think 
it  is 

necessarily  a 
question  of 
location  so 
much  as 
taxation. 
People  are 
tired  of  being 
taxed.” 
John  Campbell, 
Peak 

Entertainment 


“I  think  it  would 
be  better  than  the 
other  plan 
because  it  is 
more  in  the  same 
area  and  they 
can  overlap  by 
using  the  spine 
facilities  at 
different  times. 
We  can  save  a 
lot  of  money  and 
I  think  the 
children  would 
be  safer  in  just 
that  one  spot.” 
Doris  Swalley, 
retired  Maryville 
resident 


“I  think  we 
possibly  need 
a  new  school, 
but  I  do  not 
think  they  are 
telling  us 
everything  we 
need  to 
know.” 

Joseph  Swalley, 
retired 
Maryville 
resident 


“I  hope  that  it 
results  in  a  more 
positive  outcome 
at  the  schools.  I 
don’t  think  the 
new  location 
down  by  the  high 
school  is  any 
better  than  the 
location  they 
currently  have, 
but  I  hope  that  it 
will  be  a  positive 
change  to  enough 
people  that  it  will 
pass  the  issue  and 
I  will  support  it  at 
either  location.”

Happenings  in  Jefferson  City  may 
also  have  a  direct  effect  on  Maryville, 
Angerersaid.  Currently  there  are  nine 
bills  that  would  repeal  or  eliminate  the 
sales  tax  on  food.  Angerer  said  this 
would  be  bad  for  the  city. 

“Twenty-five  percent  of  the  sales 
tax  income  comes  from  food  tax,” 
Angerer  said. 

The  city  manager  also  estimated 
that  this  would  eliminate  $282,000  in 
municipal  dollars  and  $140,000  from 
the  Mozingo  Lake  project. 

Angerer  is  going  to  write  a  letter 
to  local  representatives  expressing  the 
cities’  concerns  with  the  proposed  leg¬ 
islation. 

The  next  Council  meeting  will  be

If  the  Board  of  Regents  gives  ap¬

want  to  buy  the  notebook  computers. 

“Students  who  are  in  upper-divi¬ 
sion  courses  where  there  is  a  need  for 
computer  applications  will  find  a  note¬

Gilmour  said. 

Gilmour  said  the  EC+  program  did 
not  fail  in  its  mission. 

“We  still  believe  that  what  we

Gilmour  said.

Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation,  Inc. 

P.O.  Box  31438  •  Cincinnati,  OH  45231

Dear  Prospective  Member: 

Liberia  should  have  a  special  place  in  the  conscience  of  the  United  States  of  America.  Its  impetus  to  become  a  nation  came  from  the  United  States.  For  149  years,  it  was  a  stalwart 
ally  of  the  United  States.  Yet  for  the  past  years,  as  a  civil  war  has  taken  almost  200,000  lives,  displaced  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  population  and  destroyed  its  infrastructure,  the 
United  States  has  treated  this  great  tragedy  as  a  regional  problem. 

Liberia  has  a  unique  historical  and  cultural  link  to  the  United  States.  Settled  by  African  Americans,  many  of  them  former  slaves,  in  the  early  decades  of  the  19th  century,  Liberian 
became  a  republic  in  1847.  The  United  States  influence  on  Liberia  is  reflected  in  the  African  nation’s  constitution  ,  the  star  and  stripes  of  its  red,  white  and  blue  flag,  the  structure  of  its 
government,  the  names  of  its  cities,  its  schools’  curriculum,  its  official  language  and  the  remarkable  degree  of  good  will  its  citizens  feel  toward  America.  Through  all  the  major  conflicts 
of  the  20th  century,  Liberians  been  among  the  most  dependable  allies  of  the  United  States.  In  both  World  Ward,  Liberia  declared  war  on  the  enemies  of  the  United  States  and  offered 
vital  air  bases,,  ports,  and  natural  resources  to  support  the  United  States  military.  During  the  Cold  War,  Liberia  voted  with  the  United  States  on  every  significant  resolution  at  the  United 
Nations.  It  hosted  facilities  for  electronic  monitoring  and  became  the  largest  base  for  United  States  intelligence-gathering  in  Africa. 

Yet  when  Liberia’s  security  was  most  at  risk  because  of  civil  conflict  the  United  States  government  deferred  to  ECOWAS,  an  under-funded  regional  organization  composed  of 
some  of  the  world’s  poorest  nations.  Half  of  the  $10  million  earmarked  by  the  United  States  to  support  a  peacekeeping  force  had  not  been  committed  by  April  1996.  Meanwhile,  the  cost 
to  the  United  States  of  responding  to  the  humanitarian  crisis  since  1990  has  been  emergency  relief  assistance  valued  at  over  $445  million,  over  $66  million  provided  in  the  past  year 
alone,  more  than  eight  times  the  amount  committed  to  peacekeeping. 

In  the  absence  of  a  viable  security  plan,  the  torrent  of  refugees  continues  to  undermine  Liberia’s  relations  with  its  immediate  neighbors.  Though  the  United  States  has  imported 
those  nations  to  admit  Liberian  refugees,  its  own  record  of  Liberian  admissions  decries  the  long  relationship  with  that  nation. 

The  approach  to  achieving  peace  in  Liberian  has  revolved  around  the  ECOWAS  process  for  six  years.  This  process  has,  in  turn  ,  been  dependent  on  a  core  group  of  ECOWAS 
nations  with  the  will  and  very  limited  resources  to  engage  in  diplomacy  tour  to  committee  forces  for  peacekeeping.  Fourteen  peace  agreements  have  been  largely  brokered  without  the 
United  States  and  other  international  parties,  such  as  the  United  Nations  or  OAU,  present  with  ECOWAS  as  working  partners  at  the  negotiating  table.  The  result  of  this  agreements  and 
the  resources,  and  leverage,  necessary  for  successful  implementation,  produced  the  tragic  results  that  we  have  witnessed  in  Liberia. 

On  August  17  the  Economic  Community  of  West  African  States  (ECOWAS)  concluded  meeting  that  provide  a  new  timetable  for  the  peace  process.  Starting  August  20,  the  warring 
factions  are  to  observe  a  cease-fire,  dismantle  checkpoints  and  withdraw  from  zones  of  combat.  The  peacekeeping  force,  expanding  from  8500  to  18,000  troops,  is  to  deploy  throughout 
Liberia  in  November.  Demobilization  is  to  be  completed  by  January  31.  Elections  are  to  be  held  on  May  31  with  a  turnover  to  an  elected  government  on  June  15.  The  revised  plan  calls 
for  sanctions  against  members  of  the  warring  factions  that  obstruct  the  peace  process.  Sanctions  include  restrictions  on  travel,  freeze  on  economic  activities,  exclusion  from  electoral 
process,  and  war  crime  charges. 

Now  the  United  States  has  another  opportunity  to  assert  its  international  leadership  at  a  critical  juncture  to  ensure  that  the  success  of  the  new  peace  process.  This  leadership  will  not 
lead  to  an  involvement  of  United  States  troops.  It  does  mean  that  the  Unites  States  must  heighten  its  diplomatic  efforts  to  help  coordinate  the  process  of  peace,  and  gather  the  funding 
that  is  necessary  for  effective  peacekeeping  an  demobilization  in  Liberia. 

The  United  States  should  take  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  its  commitment  of  $30  million  to  support  the  ECOMOG  peacekeeping  force  is  obligated  before  the  end  of  the 
fiscal  year  1996.  While  the  United  States  pledge  of  $30  million  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction  it  will  not  alone  enable  a  doubling  of  ECOMOG  to  the  18,000  troops  necessary  for 
deployment  by  November.  It  is  vital  that  the  United  States  provide  additional  funds  to  make  up  this  shortfall  or  take  the  lead  to  obtain  significant  pledges  from  other  donor  countries..  A 
top  priority  of  the  United  States  should  be  the  implementation  of  a  serious  program  for  demobilizing  Liberia’s  combatants.  Regretfully,  no  additional  funding  has  been  pledged  by  the 
United  States  to  improve  what  was  an  inadequately  funded  and  designed  demobilization  plan.  In  fact,  some  of  the  funds  allocated  in  early  1996  for  reintegration  of  Liberia’s  60,000 
combatants  have  been  diverted  elsewhere.  The  United  States  should  take  the  lead  in  designing  a  comprehensive  demobilization  program.  This  program  will  not  involve  United  States 
troops,  but  should  include  the  resources  for  every  stage  of  demobilization  from  encampment  to  training  and  counseling  of  combatants.  A  contribution  of  $20  million  (non-food  related) 
from  the  United  States  will  provide  the  resources  necessary  to  initiate  a  well  conceived  demobilization  program  and  encourage  future  contributions  form  other  international  donors. 

President  Clinton  and  the  United  States  Congress  must  make  Liberia  a  priority  on  our  foreign  relations  agenda  in  Africa.  United  States  leadership  is  critical  if  the  key  elements  are 
to  be  achieved  on  schedule  under  the  new  peace  plan.  This  leadership  will  not  lead  to  an  involvement  of  United  States  troops.  It  does  mean  that  the  United  States  through  its  Special 
Envoy,  must  heighten  its  diplomatic  efforts  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  peace  process  and  gather  the  additional  resources  necessary  for  effective  peacekeeping  and 
demobilization. 

The  United  States  should  strengthen  the  response  of  the  international  community  to  the  needs  of  the  peace  process.  The  foundation  for  a  new  international  approach  to  the  peace 
process  already  exists  with  the  International  Contact  Group  for  Liberia,  the  group  of  donor  countries  that  have  pledged  support  to  the  peace  process.  The  concept  behind  the  ICGL 
should  be  expanded  to  a  tightly  coordinated  partnership  that  includes  the  United  States,  ECOWAS,  and  the  United  Nations.  This  high  level  of  cooperation  will  ensure  that  scarce 
resources  are  effectively  utilized. 

The  outbreak  of  fighting  in  Monrovia  in  April-May  of  1996  was  the  latest  in  a  series  of  clashes  in  Liberia’s  intractable  war.  During  the  past  nearly  seven  years,  the  war  has 
produced  shocking  humanitarian  conditions  for  Liberian  civilians.  The  most  recent  fighting  exacerbated  even  further  these  conditions.  Humanitarian  assistance  organizations  have  been 
Unable  to  deliver  food  and  other  emergency  services  because  of  the  fighting  in  Monrovia.  Their  resources  looted  by  gangs  of  combatants  and  the  safety  of  their  relief  workers 
threatened,  these  organizations  closed  or  dramatically  reduced  their  operations  in  Liberia. 

As  a  result  of  the  civil  war  in  Liberia,  an  estimated  800,000  Liberians  are  internally  displaced;  another  800,000  are  refugees  in  neighboring  countries  that  are  among  the  poorest  in 
the  world.  Approximately  50  percent  of  the  population  in  Monrovia,  upwards  of  350,000  persons,  were  forced  to  flee  their  homes  due  to  the  April-May  fighting  and  another  3,000  died. 
During  June-July  some  3,300  new  cases  of  cholera  were  reported  in  Monrovia  and  a  July  survey  found  malnutrition  rates  for  children  in  displaced  shelters  have  increased  up  to  25 
percent.  Now  that  the  dust  of  the  Civil  War  in  Liberia  is  settling  down,  an  era  of  a  NEW  LIBERIA  is  at  hand.  Whether  anyone  likes  it  or  not,  a  leadership  is  bound  to  emerge, 
supposedly  to  shoulder  the  national  responsibilities  of  politics  and  administration  and  to  ensure  the  continued  survival  of  the  Liberian  people  and  culture. 

That  such  leadership  will  be  genuine  and  committed  is  a  matter  that  you  as  Liberians  and  friends  of  Liberia  can  decide,  or  at  least  influence.  But  choosing  national  leadership  is  a 
serious  and  difficult  business.  In  Liberia,  bombed-out  homes  and  shops  are  painful  reminders  of  what  happens  when  leaders  are  chosen  unwisely.  We  cannot  allow  this  to  happen 
again.  This  is  why  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation  is  campaigning  for  PEACE,  SECURITY,  SOCIAL,  ECONOMIC,  EDUCATIONAL  AND  POLITICAL  JUSTICE  IN 
LIBERIA. 

The  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation  has  carefully  examines  the  administrative  and  operational  policies  of  both  the  past  and  present  administration  in  Liberia,  and  in  our  candid 
opinion,  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  help  Liberia  go  in  the  direction  she  needs  to  go.  We  as  Liberians  must  try  to  have  a  positive  influence  on  the  selection  of  the  national  programs 
and  the  corresponding  leadership  which  will  inevitably  affect  our  lives  and  the  lives  of  our  people  for  many  year  to  come. 

My  fellow  Liberians  and  Friends  of  Liberia,  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation  has  embarked  on  a  mission  to  ensure  that  PEACE,  UNITY,  SECURITY,  FREEDOM  AND 
SOCIAL  JUSTICE  prevail  in  Liberia.  This  is  an  awesome  responsibility  that  can  only  occur  if  we  cooperate  as  a  team.  History  will  judge  us  not  by  what  we  say,  but  by  what  we  do. 
With  God  and  the  determined  mind,  there  is  nothing  we  cannot  achieve  for  our  Liberian  Society.  It  is  in  this  light  that  I  urge  you  to  support  and  contribute  to  the  Liberian  Social  Justice 
Foundation’s  programs. 

Liberia,  the  African  nation  established  in  the  1800s  by  freed  American  slaves,  has  been  tom  by  civil  war  since  1989.  What  does  the  Liberian  Civil  War  mean  to  Americans  in 
terms  of  health  care,  humanitarian  relief,  stability  throughout  Africa  and  the  continuation  of  missionary  work?  If  you  share  in  the  dream  of  pace  in  Liberia,  a  country  founded  upon 
American  ideals,  you  are  invited  to  become  more  informed  by  writing  to  the  LIBERIAN  SOCIAL  JUSTICE  FOUNDATION,  POST  OFFICE  BOX  31438,  CINCINNATI,  OHIO 
45231.  (513)931-1872. 

I  am  writing  to  introduce  you  to  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation,  Inc.,  a  broad-based  social  nonprofit  organization.  The  mission  of  the  LSJFI  is  two-fold:  we  are  dedicated 
to  restoring  a  just  and  stable  society  in  Liberia,  and  to  improving  the  quality  of  life  for  all  Liberians,  both  at  home  and  abroad. 

On  behalf  of  our  members,  I  appeal  to  you  for  financial  assistance  in  support  of  LSJF  activities.  An  application  for  membership  is  included  which  contains  a  breakdown  of  1 
membership  fees.  Please  know  that  any  amount  you  can  contribute  will  be  helpful  to  us.  Your  support  of  the  Foundation,  and  your  awareness  of  its  concern  is  deeply  appreciated. 
Should  you  have  any  questions  or  suggestions,  please  feel  free  to  write  us  or  call.  Thank  you  for  your  time,  your  contribution,  and  your  generosity.  Checks  and  money  orders  should  be 
made  payable  to  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation,  Inc.

Committees  plan  Trimester  dates 


by  Wendy  Broker _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Trimester  discussions  are  expanding 
throughout  campus  and  until  the  University 
finds  the  money,  the  committees  will  continue 
to  meet. 

A  major  asset  to  the  trimester  is  the  year- 
round  usage  of  the  campus,  but  it  can’t  be 
decided  until  Gov.  Mel  Carnahan  and  the  Co¬ 
ordinating  Board  for  Higher  Education  dis¬ 
tribute  the  money. 

Annelle  Weymuth,  executive  assistant  to 
the  president,  said  until  the  legislators  decide, 
the  project  is  in  limbo. 

“If  the  legislators  are  willing  to  give  us 
money  for  heating  and  cooling  to  make  the 
campus  usable  year-round,  why  wouldn’t  we 
take  advantage  of  it?”  Weymuth  said. 

There  are  still  many  questions  unanswered, 
and  hopefully  the  interviews  will  answer 
some  of  them,  Weymuth  said. 

“We  need  more  information  right  now,” 
she  said.  “We  are  not  ignoring  questions,  we 
are  just  asking  questions  in  a  sequential  fash¬ 
ion.” 

Committees  will  begin  conducting  inter¬ 
views  with  other  public  colleges  that  use  the 
trimester  system. 

“We  will  be  contacting  10  universities  as 
part  of  an  investigation  into  the  advantages 
and  disadvantages  of  trimesters,  for  the  stu¬ 
dents,  faculty  and  campus  facilities  utiliza¬ 
tion,”  Weymuth  said.  “We  are  also  asking 
about  many  potential  problems  and  how  they 
dfealt  with  them.” 

Merry  McDonald,  professor  of  computer 
science  and  information  systems,  and  the 
other  calendar  committee  members  have  al¬ 


ready  gathered  information  from  other  cam¬ 
puses  to  create  three  sample  calendars. 

“We  took  sample  calendars  from  other 
schools  and  took  what  seemed  to  work  for 
them  and  implemented  it  in  ours,”  she  said. 
“We  intend  to  look  at  more,  and  get  more 
feedback  from  the  faculty  on  the  ones  we  al- . 
ready  have.  Right  now,  it’s  just  a  feasibility 
study.” 

McDonald  said  a  trimester  schedule  would 
cut  breaks  students  have  become  accustomed 
to. 

“If  you  are  trying  to  do  three  semesters  in 
a  year,  it’s  inevitable  to  shorten  breaks,  though 
nobody  likes  it,”  she  said. 

Weymuth  said  the  calendar  and  many  other 
factors  will  be  discussed  once  options  have 
been  discovered. 

“We  will  have  focus  groups  involving  stu¬ 
dent,  faculty  and  staff,  to  help  show  us  what 
they  want,”  she  said.  “We  want  this  to  be  posi¬ 
tive.  We  will  try  our  very  best  to  meet  the 
needs  of  everyone.” 

The  needs  are  being  considered  by  sev¬ 
eral  committees. 

“Our  committee’s  job  is  to  figure  out  how 
we  can  provide  for  students  and  their  aca¬ 
demic  needs,”  VanDyke,  dean  of  libraries  and 
chair  of  the  academic  and  curriculum  com¬ 
mittee,  said.  “This  could  involve  rethinking 
the  sequence  of  classes,  and  when  to  offer 
them,  a  real  shaking  up  of  something  we  have 
become  used  to.  Our  group  has  submitted  our 
concerns  in  the  form  of  a  four-page  docu¬ 
ment.” 

VanDyke  said  the  committees  are  analyz¬ 
ing  each  part  of  the  project.  , 

“We  are  looking  at  advantages  and  disad¬ 
vantages  with  our  needs  in  mind,”  she  said.

All  of  us  are  searching  for  some¬ 
thing  —  happiness,  love  and  money. 
Students  arc  either  looking  for  sum¬ 
mer  jobs,  internships,  or  in  the  case  of 
seniors,  permanent  job  placement. 

Career  Services  is  having  Spring 
Career  Day  from  1  p.m.  to  4  p.m.,  Feb. 
1 1 ,  in  the  Union  Ballroom  to  help  with 
this  search. 

A  Teacher  Placement  Day  will  be 
held  April  29  for  education  majors. 

The  businesses  attending  will  of¬ 
fer  opportunities  to  students  to  find  a 
job. 

Businesses  ranging  from  sporting 
good  stores  to  the  FBI  will  be  show¬ 
ing  their  wares  in  hope  of  finding  fu¬ 
ture  employees. 

Career  Services  send  over  3,000 
invitations,  but  only  80  businesses 
come  because  of  space,  placement 
clerk  Jcni  Crowder  said. 

“Gateway  2000  and  Sprint  arc  new 
this  year,  and  we  have  a  few  that  are 
adding  to  the  list  each  day,”  Crowder 
said.  “If  we  do  have  80,  it  will,  be  the 
biggest  we  have  ever  had.” 

Crowder  said  Career  Day,  despite 
popular  belief,  is  not  just  for  business 
and  agricultural  majors. 

“The  reason  several  majors  are  not 
represented  is  because  there  is  not 


enouglt  student  attendance  from 
people  in  those  majors  on  Career 
Day,”  she  said.  “However,  many  of  the 
business  companies  arc  not  just  look¬ 
ing  for  business  majors.  It  is  impor¬ 
tant  to  sec  what  they  arc  looking  for. 
You  might  be  surprised.” 

Crowder  said  Career  Day  has 
helped  students  find  employment  in 
the  past. 

"Last  year,  15  were  placed  and  that 
doesn’t  count  internships,”  she  said. 
“The  two  days  after  are  booked  solid 
for  interviews,  but  many  businesses 
arc  looking  for  upperclassmen  and  the 
turnout  is  mostly  freshmen  and  sopho¬ 
mores.” 

Career  Services  recommends  stu¬ 
dents  dress  appropriately  for  the  event. 

"Many  businesses  in  the  past  have 
complained  that  students  dress  too 
casually,”  Crowder  said.  “This  is  a 
little  more  serious  than  going  to  class, 
you  could  get  hired,  so  you  should 
present  yourself  in  a  professional  man¬ 
ner." 

Increased  student  attendance  at  Ca¬ 
reer  Day  would  increase  the  probabil¬ 
ity  of  more  businesses  attending  in  the 
future,  Crowder  said. 

“A  lot  of  businesses  come  because 
of  the  past  interest  shown  in  their 
field,”  she  said.  “If  we  could  show  the 
interest  in  more  areas  to  entice  com¬ 
panies,  more  may  come.”

Assistant  University  News  Editor 

The  job  he  does  has  not  changed, 
but  his  title  has. 

Bob  Bush,  formerly  the  vice  presi¬ 
dent  of  applied  research  and  the  insti¬ 
tute  for  quality  productivity,  is  now  the 
University’s  vice  president  for  re¬ 
gional  initiatives. 

Under  Bush’s  leadership,  North¬ 
west  has  worked  with  state  agencies, 
school  districts  and  corporations  to 
maintain  relationships  within  the  en¬ 
tire  region  of  northwest  Missouri 
through  numerous  projects. 

Some  of  these  programs  include 
the  Healthy  Communities  project 


which  focuses  on  improving  the  qual¬ 
ity  of  life  in  northwest  Missouri;  the 
Biomass  project  and  the  recent  formu¬ 
lation  of  the  Northwest  Missouri  Edu¬ 
cation  Consortium,  which  helps  bring 
post-secondary  education  to  people 
throughout  the  region. 

Bush  also  works  with  the  Missouri 
Western  State  College  graduate  cen¬ 
ter  and  helps  to  facilitate  distance 
learning  projects  through  the  campus 
in  St.  Joseph. 

A  familiar  face  locally,  Bush  works 
in  departments  such  as  Campus  Safety, 
CD  ROM  technology  which  helped 
lead  to  the  EC+  program  and  Univer¬ 
sity  grant  writing  for  faculty  and  staff. 


Nancy  Baxter,  University  grants 
director,  works  with  Bush  and  said  the 
new  title  helps  define  Bush’s  depart¬ 
ment. 

“It’s  perfect,”  she  said.  “It  appro¬ 
priately  identifies  what  he  has  been 
doing  for  years.” 

Baxter  also  said  the  title  should 
raise  awareness  of  the  applied  research 
department. 

“New  projects  should  come  this 
way  because  people  recognize  the 
importance  of  supporting  regional  ini¬ 
tiatives,”  Baxter  said. 

Bush  said  a  critical  issue  facing 
northwest  Missouri  is  the  decline  of 
opportunities  for  members  of  the  com¬ 


munity  once  they  have  completed  their 
college  degree. 

“This  region  needs  to  diversify  if 
we  are  going  to  survive  and  this  insti¬ 
tution  has  a  direct  relationship  to  that,” 
Bush  said.  “We  want  to  provide  op¬ 
portunities  which  can  be  shared  with 
everyone  throughout  the  region  and 
can  benefit  from  them.” 

Bush  said  the  new  title  has  been 
evolutionary  and  the  third  one  at 
Northwest. 

“I  have  a  very  fascinating  career 
with  lots  of  variety  and  new  ideas,” 
Bush  said.  ‘.‘I’m  very  fortunate,  I’ve 
always  felt  like  I’ve  had  one  of  the  best 
jobs  in  northwest  Missouri.”

With  (he  recent  snowfalls,  the  city 
of  Maryville  has  been  doing  every¬ 
thing  possible  to  keep  the  streets  clean 
and  safe,  but  it  definitely  has  been 
costly. 

The  relatively  small  storm  that  hit 
northwest  Missouri  last  week  cost  the 
city  approximately  $7,000  to  salt  and 
clean  many  of  the  streets. 

Since  Dec.  5,  which  was  when  the 
first  winter  storm  hit  Mary  ville,  ap¬ 
proximately  $21,600  has  been  spent 
on  numerous  hours  of  labor  and  ma¬ 
terials,  Ron  Brohammer,  assistant  city 
manager/director  of  Public  Works, 
said. 

“I  am  counting  regular  labor,  over¬ 
time  hours,  the  mix  used  on  the  roads, 
any  breakdowns  that  may  have  oc¬ 
curred,  the  fuel  needed  to  run  the 
trucks  and  tractors  and  other  expend¬ 
ables,”  Brohammer  said. 

The  city  has  already  used  close  to 
90  tons  of  mix,  which  contains  salt  and 
calcium  chloride,  on  just  this  last 
storm.  The  mix  costs  around  $12  per 
ton. 

In  order  to  pay  for  these  costs,  the 
city  uses  money  from  taxes  and  a 
street  budget,  but  snow  removal  is  not 
specified  in  this  budget. 


“We  do  not  budget  directly  for 
snow  removal,”  Brohammer  said. 
“The  bottom  line  is  that  we  will  spend 
whatever  it  takes. ..and  use  judgement 
and  common  sense  to  decide  how 
much  is  enough.” 

Often  there  are  consequences  to 
spending  more  money  than  is  allo¬ 
cated  in  the  budget,  even  though  it  is 
necessary.  Although  the  consequences 
do  not  come  in  the  form  of  tax  in¬ 
creases,  there  may  be  work  that  can¬ 
not  be  done  in  the  summer  because  of 
winter  spending. 

“Every  dollar  that  we  spend  in  the 
wintertime  on  salt  and  (labor)  hours 
and  time,  arc  dollars  that  can’t  be 
spent  on  additional  asphalt  on  streets 
and  those  kinds  of  things,”  Broham¬ 
mer  said. 

If  the  city  does  run  out  of  money, 
then  a  general  fund  will  be  utilized.  It 
is  money  that  is  pin  away  for  anything 
unexpected  that  may  occur. 

But,  in  most  cases,  the  city  has  not 
needed  to  tap  into  the  fund  and  has 
remained  within  the  budget. 

Although  this  winter’s  spending 
thus  far  is  slightly  higher  than  the 
1 995-96  total  of  $  1 7. 1 60,  Brohammer 
said  Maryville  will  do  its  best  to  meet 
the  goal  of  clearing  the  streets  the  best 
they  can  with  the  resources  and  funds 
allowed.

Babies  win  trophies 

by  Jacob  DIPIetre _ _ _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Many  parents  believe  their  baby  is  the  cutest.  However,  New  Star  Dis¬ 
covery  determined  the  most  beautiful  baby  at  a  regional  baby  contest  Sun¬ 
day  morning  at  the  Cardinal  Inn  in  Maryville. 

There  are  six  different  age  divisions  in  the  contest:  0-7  months,  8-14 
months,  15-23  months,  24-36  months,  3-4  years  old  and  5-6  years  old.  The 
contest  is  open  to  boys  and  girls,  each  having  their  own  categories  respec¬ 
tively. 

In  the  0-7  months  division  Brayden  Martin  of  Maryville  won  the  boys’ 
division.  Next  in  the  8-14  month  category  Mackenzy  Philett  won  on  the 
girls’  side,  while  Brady  Clements  won  for  the  boys.  In  the  15-23  month  age 
division  Cynthia  Smail  was  the  winner.  MaKenzy  Lawson  won  the  24-36 
month  age  division.  And  Tyler  Greeley  won  the  3-4  year  old  category. 

Colleen  Adams,  New  Star  Discovery  representative,  said  the  reason  for 
the  shortage  of  contestants  was  because  of  the  area  and  the  weather. 

“We  have  had  contests  with  anywhere  from  eight  to  1 37  contestants,” 
Adams  said.  “The  weather  was  real  bad  and  it  was  a  small  area  so  the  small 
number  was  expected.” 

The  most  beautiful  baby  winners  received  a  trophy,  a  crown,  their  entry 
fee  for  the  state  contest  and  a  photo  shoot  worth  $  1 50.  Awards  also  included 
children  with  the  prettiest  eyes,  best  head  shot  and  two  overall  high-point 
winners.  Regional  Director  Nancy  Skillett  said  judging  criteria  is  divided. 
Fifty  percent  was  natural  beauty  and  the  other  50  percent  was  personality. 


Wild  horse  adapts  to  life  in 
captivity,  resident  breaks, 
trains,  mustang  for  parades 

by  Ruby  Pittmer _ 

Community  News  Editor 

For  more  than  30  years  it  has  been 
his  hobby  to  train  and  break  horses. 
However,  his  biggest  challenge  started 
in  September  1988  when  Sassy  ar¬ 
rived. 

Sassy  was  a  3-year-old  mustang 

*  horse  when  she  was  found  running 
wild  in  Nevada.  David  Dredge,  of 
Maryville,  purchased  her  for  $125  and 
transported  the  black  horse  to  Mis¬ 
souri  to  care  for  her. 

“I  just  thought  it  sounded  neat,” 
Dredge  said.  “I’ve  always  liked  horses 
and  training  them.  What  a  better  place 

*■  to  start  than  with  a  wild  one?” 

To  adopt  the  horse,  Dredge  con¬ 
tacted  the  Bureau  of  Land  Manage¬ 
ment  which  is  located  in  Jackson, 
Miss.  His  application  described  the 
specifications  of. the  horse’s  stall, 
along  with  general  information  about 
himself  and  why  he  wanted  the  endan¬ 
gered  species. 

•  Dredge  built  a  special  enclosed 
stall  that  was  10  feet  by  12  feet.  At¬ 
tached  to  this  stall  was  a  run  that  mea¬ 
sured  12  feet  by  20  feet.  He  built  a 
fence  at  least  six  feet  high  constructed 
out  of  wood.  The  fence  could  not  be 
wire  because  the  horse,  while  adjust¬ 
ing  to  captivity,  might  get  caught  and 

}  injured  in  the  wires. 

Patience  was  the  key  requirement 
when  he  broke  the  horse  in.  For  the 
first  months  of  her  captivity.  Dredge 
became  friends  with  the  horse. 

“It’s  a  slow  process,”  Dredge  said. 
“With  mustangs  you  just  don’t  walk 
up  to  them.  She  was  so  scared.” 

^  The  wild  horse  had  other  needs. 


Sassy  was  given  all  the  required  shots 
and  wormed.  She  also  had  to  be  given 
the  Coggins  Test,  which  checks  for 
diseases  prone  to  horses.  Because 
Sassy  was  in  the  wild  for  the  first  three 
years  of  her  life,  her  hooves  also  re¬ 
quired  more  trimmings  than  horses 
born  in  captivity. 

In  the  wild,  the  horse  fed  on  vari¬ 
ous  types  of  grasses  native  to  Nevada. 
While  in  captivity,  Sassy  learned  to 
eat  grains. 

“You  have  to  cut  down  on  the 
feed,”  Dredge  said.  “They  aren’t  used 
to  having  an  abundant  amount. 
They’ll  eat  about  anything  and  you 
have  to  control  their  intake  or  else 
they  will  overeat." 

For  one  year,  the  horse  was  in  a 
separate  stall  and  run. 

Dredge  said  after  becoming  friends 
with  Sassy,  the  rest  of  the  breaking 
and  training  “went  along  real  fast”  and 
he  was  able  to  put  a  saddle  and  bridle 
on  her. 

He  rode  the  horse  in  many  parades 
and  during  other  events.  He  also 
makes  presentations  to  scouters  and 
4-H  clubs. 

Dredge  said  purchasing  the  horse 
was  the  cheapest  part  of  his  hobby. 
Feed  costs  and  renovations  to  the  stall 
and  stable  were  more  expensive. 

‘T  ve  thought  about  getting  another 
wild  mustang,”  Dredge  said.  “Hind¬ 
sight  would  tell  me  to  get  a  yearling 
colt.  They  seem  to  be  easier  to  break.” 

Dredge  sold  Sassy  one  year  ago 
because  his  kids  had  grown  up  and 
there  was  no  one  there  to  ride  her. 
Fearing  she  would  become  ill  if  no' 
one  would  properly  exercise  the  ani¬ 
mal,  Marci  Gillis  bought  the  horse  for 
her  daughter,  Ashton,  to  ride  and  show 
in  4-H  programs. 

Dredge  recently  gave  a  presenta¬ 
tion  to  the  Nodaway  County  Girl 
Scouts.

School  Board  unites 


by  Lindsey  Corey _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Maryville  R-II  School  Board 
members  have  pulled  together  for  the 
April  1  bond  issue  and  are  expecting 
positive  results. 

“We  decided  to  put  forth  a  unified 
voice  and  not  our  individual  opin¬ 
ions,”  Board  member  Ray  Courter 
said. 

After  changing  the  proposed  site 
and  architectural  firm,  the  Board  is 
ready  to  begin  its  campaign  to  build 
a  new  middle  school  and  to  renovate 
the  elementary  school  and  the  high 
school. 

“One  of  the  top  complaints  (about 
previous  bond  issues)  was  the  site 
being  too  close  to  the  college,”  Board 
member  John  Redden  said.  “We’ve 
changed  that  soi  we  hope  it’ll  pass.” 

Change  hasibeeh  the  major  focus 
for  Board  members. 

“The  change  of  site  is  appealing 
to  many  voters  and  our  previous  ef¬ 
forts  gave  us  good  recognition,” 
Board  member  James  Redd  said.  “I’m 
very  optimistic.” 

Voters  are  more  likely  to  focus 
on  the  cost  of  the  bond  issue,  but 


Board  members  believe  there  is  no 
better  time  than  the  present  to  take 
advantage  of  the  opportunity  for 
progress. 

“It’s  really  not  a  question  of  if  we 
need  the  facility  and  improvements, 
but  when  we  .will  be  able  to  get 
started,”  Board  president  Rego  Jones 
said.  “There  is  nothing  we  can  do 
about  the  dollar  figure  because  costs 
never  seem  to  go  down.” 

Some  see  the  cost  of  the  bond  to 
be  a  bargain. 

“In  relation  to  the  previous  bond, 
(patrons)  are  receiving  more  for  their 
money,”  Redd  said.  “We  will  be  ad¬ 
dressing  three  facilities  to  help  chil¬ 
dren  all  through  the  system.  The 
longer  we  wait  the  more  pronounced 
our  needs  will  become  and  the  more 
expensive  it  will  be.” 

Board  members,  architects  and 
administrators  will  answer  questions 
at  9  a.m.,  Saturday,  at  Eugene  Field 
Elementary  School. 

“People  need  to  understand  the 
need  throughout  the  whole  district,” 
Jones  said.  “I’d  encourage  people  to 
go  to  the  presentation  and  make  up 
their  mind  there,  instead  of  rumors  or 
past  bond  issues.”

Time  could  not  run  fast  enough 
for  the  women’s  basketball  team 
when  it  played  Missouri  Western 
State  College  Wednesday  night. 

The  Bearcats  (8-10,  4-6  MIA  A) 
surged  ahead  63-59  on  a  layup  by 
junior  guard  Autumn  Fcakcr  with 
1 :52  left  to  play.  Western’s  Stephanie 
Jackson  answered  by  scoring  the  next 
three  points. 

After  senior  forward  Sandi  Ickcs 
missed  a  free  throw  with  36  seconds 
to  go,  the  Lady  Griffons’  Jenny  Marr, 
who  paced  her  team  with  1 8  points 
in  the  second  half,  gave  her  team' 
a  64-63  victory  with  a  layup. 

Head  coach 

Wayne  Winstead  //’  /p  ®*S

“There’s  no  miestinn  C 


44  percent  for  the  Griffons  but  only 
27  percent  from  the  free  throw  line, 
compared  to  Missouri  Western’s  61 
percent. 

Winstead  said  the  team  showed  pa¬ 
tience  on  offense. 

“We  played  well  and  did  the  things 
we  wanted  to,”  Winstead  said.  “We 
needed  a  break  here  and  there  and  it 
wasn’t  in  the  cards  as  far  as  calls  go.” 

Northwest  had  won  four  games  in 
a  row  at  home  before  the  loss  to  the 
Griffons.  The  loss  dropped  the  ’Cats 
record  at  home  this  season 
to  7-2.  North-west’s  record  at  Bear¬

“I  said,  ‘Let’s  just  take  the  best 
shot,”’ Winstead  said.  “I  thought  she 
(freshman  guard  Andrea  Robertson) 
was  fouled,  but  they  turned  around 
and  called  a  foul  on  us.” 

Senior  guard  Kristin  Folk  said  the 
team  was  trying  to  go  inside  on  the 
Final  shot. 

“Everyone  in  the  conference 
knows  our  strength  is  the  inside 
game,”  Folk  said.  “There  were  times 
when  we  had  two  or  three  players  on 
our  one  player  going  inside.” 

Northwest  led  by  eight  at  half¬ 
time.  The  Bearcats  led  by  as  much 
as  10  with  16:21  to  go  in  the  game 
before  Western  tied  the  score  at  50 
with  10:10  left  in  the  game. 

Junior  forward  Justean  Bohnsack

Griffons  slip  past  ’Cats  82-71

Chief  Reporter 

It  was  not  only,  a  big  weekend 
in  professional  sports,  i.e.  the  Su¬ 
per  Bowl,  but  the  men’s  and 
women’s  indoor  track  teams  were 
in  on  the  action  too,  showing  their 
abilities  against  competition  at  the 
Nebraska  Open  Saturday. 

The  women  displayed  some  of 
their  talent  in  senior  Heidi  Metz, 
who  broke  the  school  record  in  the 
3,000-mcter  run  by  nearly  1 0  sec¬ 
onds,  placing  third.  Junior  Kathy 
Kearns  finished  behind  Metz,  plac¬ 
ing  Fifth.  Junior  Julie  Humphreys 
finished  second  in  the  weight 
throw. 

Junior  Leslie  Dickherber  not 
only  placed  eighth  at  the  meet  in 
the  shot  put,  but  also  provisionally 
qualified  for  nationals.  Freshman 
Jill  Eppcnbaugh  also  threw  well 
Saturday,  grabbing  Fil  th  place  in  the 
shot  put. 

Coach  Ron  DeShon  said  he  held 
a  couple  of  the  season’s  top  per¬ 
formers  out  of  this  meet  (as  not  to 
tire  them  out  this  early  in  the  sea¬ 
son),  including  Jacshelle  Sasser. 

DeShon  said  he  is  taking  every¬ 
body,  an  A-team  and  a  B-team,  to 
the  team’s  next  meet  at  Central 
Missouri  State  University. 

“This  meet  coming  up  at 


CMSU,  the  Mule  Relays  is.  very 
important  at  this  point  of  the  sea¬ 
son,”  he  said.  “It  will  help  us  find 
out  where  we  stand  against  confer¬ 
ence  competition  and  if  we  are  con¬ 
tenders  or  pretenders  to  the  confer¬ 
ence  championship.” 

The  men’s  indoor  track  team 
had  its  share  of  stars  as  well  at  the 
Nebraska  Open. 

Team  co-captain  junior  Chad 
Sutton  finished  third  and  provision¬ 
ally  qualified  for  nationals  in  the 
high  jump,  Saturday.  Sophomore 
Jimmy  Jeffrey  performed  well  also, 
just  missing  provisional  qualifica¬ 
tion,  and  finished  4th  in  the  200- 
meter  dash  and  7th  in  the  55-meter 
dash. 

Coach  Rich  Alsup  said  he  was 
pleased  with  the  team’s  perfor- 
.  mance  Saturday. 

“I  thought  they  performed  well 
'  for  only  having  a  week  of  practice 
leading  up  to  it,”  Alsup  said. 

Sutton  said  the  team  will  im¬ 
prove  in  time. 

“As  time  goes  on,  we  will  im¬ 
prove  more  and  more,  and  be  in 
good  shape  to  be  competitive  at 
conference.”  Sutton  said. 

The  team  will  have  a  chance  to 
improve  in  Lawrence  when  it  faces 
the  University  of  Kansas,  Kansas 
State  University  and  Wichita  State 
University.

Missouri  Western’s  defensive  pressure  ale  the 
Bearcat  men  alive  Wednesday  night  and  the  ’Cats 
dropped  the  conference  game  82-71. 

“It’s  kind  of  like  sharks  around  blood,”  head  coach 
Steve  Tappmeyer  said,  commenting  on  Missouri 
Western’s  tenacious  defense. 

The  'Cats’  record  fell  to  7-11  overall  and  4-6  in 
MIAA  conference  play. 

The  Bearcats  had  their  fair  share  of  opportunities 
but  could  not  cash  in. 

“We  had  some  good  looks  at  the  basket,  but  we 
just  got  too  tentative,”  Tappmeyer  said. 

Northwest  was  not  going  to  roll  over  for  the  Grif¬ 
fons  and  the  ’Cats  held  a  39-36  halftime  lead. 

However,  the  Bearcats  were  a  completely  differ¬ 
ent  team  in  the  second  half. 

“It  was  like  night  and  day,”  senior  guard  Silas 
Williams  said.  “One  half  we  came  out  playing  and  in 
the  second  half  we  didn’t  play  with  the  same  enthusi¬ 
asm.” 

The  ’Cats  remained  within  striking  distance  until 
the  waning  moments,  but  they  were  outscored  22-12 
in  the  final  8:40  seconds  of  the  game. 

“We  didn’t  shoot  the  ball  as  comfortably  as  we  did 
in  the  First  half,”  Tappmeyer  said.  “I  thought  we  did 
shy  away  from  some  contact  at  times  in  the  ballgame.” 

Northwest  62  Missouri-Rolla  53 

The  Bearcats  traveled  to  Rolla  last  Saturday  for  a 
shootout  with  the  University  of  Missouri-Rolla  (11- 
6)  ballclub  and  came  away  with  a  62-53  victory. 

Tappmeyer  said  the  team  played  as  sharp  as  it  had 
all  season, 

“I  thought  we  probably  played  our  best  game  of 
the  year  so  far,”  Tappmeyer  said.  “They  had  a  big 
crowd  and  I  thought  we  kept  our  composure.” 

On  Saturday,  the  Bearcats  will  travel  to  Jefferson 
City  to  battle  Lincoln  University.

The  Bear-cats  will  try  to  snap  their

want  to  discuss  but  I’ll  start  at  the 
college  level. 

Lester  Earl  signed  a  national 
letter  of  intent  to  play  basketball  for 
four  years  at  Louisiana  State 
^University,  but  now  after  only  one 
semester  he  says  he  wants  to  transfer 
to  another  Division  I  school  —  the 
University  of  Kansas. 

Dale  Brown,  head  LSU  coach,  is 
refusing  to  allow  Earl  to  transfer.  If 
Brown  allows  Earl  to  transfer,  he 
would  lose  only  one  year  of  eligibil¬ 
ity.  But  if  Brown  refuses,  Earl  would 
lose  two  years  of  eligibility. 

I  think  it’s  about  time  Lester  paid 
the  price  for  his  actions,  so  I  hope 
coach  Brown  does  not  give  in. 

Then  what  about  the  situation  at 
Iowa  State  with  forward  Kenny 
Pratt,  the  Cyclones’  second  leading 
scorer  last  season? 

In  late  December,  he  was  out 
carousing  in  the  wee  hours  and  he 
got  hit  by  another  car.  Pratt  was 
drunk  at  the  time  of  the  accident  and 
was  arrested  for  drunken  driving 
after  he  failed  a  breathalizer  test.  But 
Pratt  decided  he  did  not  want  to  be 
arrested  and  resisted.  He  kicked  a 
police  officer  in  the  face,  loosening 
the  ofFicer’s  tooth. 

Pratt  was  immediately  kicked  off 
the  Iowa  State  basketball  team,  but  a 
university  committee  reinstated 
Pratt. 

Kenny  if  you  did  the  deed  then 
pay  the  price  and  sit  out  a  few 
games.  Once  again  this  is  another 
athlete  that  does  not  want  to  be  held 
accountable  for  his  actions. 

This  problem  not  only  affects 
college  athletes,  it  seems  to  be  a  big 
problem  on  the  professional  level  as 
well. 

What  about  Oksana  Baiul  and  her 
drunk  driving  charge?  She  said  she 
would  check  into  an  alcohol 
program  to  help  her  understand  her 
problem.  But  she  is  only  trying  to 
get  out  of  her  drunk  driving  charge. 

It’s  just  another  sign  of  an  athlete 
not  wanting  to  be  held  accountable 
for  their  actions. 

Players  like  these  can  ruin  the 
reputation  of  their  sports  and  I  think,  , 
'that  is  why  many  fans  are  becoming  ' 
disgusted  with  the  sports  world.

Boys’  basketball  squad  avenges  early  season  loss  to  Benton 

’ Hounds  rebound  from  conference  loss  at  Chillicothe;  solid  defense  leads  way  to  49-32  win  in  St.  Joseph  Tuesday 


by  Scott  Summers _ 

Chief  Reporter 

The  Benton  Cardinals  were  the 
most  recent  team  to  have  its  feathers 
ruffled  by  the  Spoofhound  boys’  bas¬ 
ketball  team,  losing  49-32  on  their 
home  court. 

Maryville  has  turned  its  season 
around  recently,  winning  five  Out  of 
its  last  six  games  and  improving  its 
overall  record  to  11-6  after  a  slug¬ 
gish  start  to  the  season. 


One  big  factor  in  the  Spoof- 
hounds’  recent  on-court  success  has 
been  their  tremendous  defensive  ef¬ 
fort. 

“I  think  we  played  great  defense,” 
Kuwitzky  said.  “Holding  them  to  32 
points  on  their  own  floor  was  a  re¬ 
ally  good  effort  on  our  part.” 

Kuwitzky  said  his  team  did  ex¬ 
actly  what  it  needed  to  do  to  beat  the 
Cardinals. 

“We  had  a  pretty  good  second  half 
of  taking  care  of  the  basketball,  and 


we  hit  our  free  throws,”  Kuwitzky 
said. 

The  leading  scorers  in  the  contest 
were  juniors  John  Otte  and  Adam 
Weldon,  each  reaching  double  figures 
with  12  points. 

Although  Kuwitzky  was  very 
happy  with  the  team’s  effort,  he  said 
the  ’Hounds  still  have  some  areas  of 
concern  to  deal  with. 

“We  need  to  strive  to  gain  some 
consistency  on  the  offensive  end,” 
Kuwitzky  said. 


Chillicothe  51  Maryville  42 

Maryville  found  out  the  hard  way 
that  Chillicothe  is  not  any  easier  to 
beat  in  basketball  than  they  are  in 
football. 

The  Spoofhounds  traveled  to 
Chillicothe  Friday,  and  the  Hornets 
stung  the  ’Hounds  in  a  51-42  loss. 

The  ’Hounds  led  by  three  points 
at  the  half  but  could  not  keep  up  the 
pace  with  Hornets  in  the  second  half. 

“It  came  down  to  two  or  three 


plays  at  the  end  of  the  game,” 
Kuwitzky  said.  “At  the  end,  we 
made  some  bad  decisions,  and  that 
madc-the  difference.” 

Junior  Grant  Sutton  led  the 
Spoofhounds  in  their  effort,  picking 
apart  the  Hornet  defense  for  13 
points. 

The  ’Hounds  will  play  host  to 
Falls  City  at  7:30  p.m.  Friday.  The 
’Hounds’  next  game  will  be  Tues¬ 
day  when  they  battle  the  Lafayette 
Fighting  Irish  in  Maryville.

Girls’  basketball  team 
preps  for  home  game 
against  East  Buchanan . 

by  Jacob  DIPietre _ 

Chief  Reporter 

The  ’Hounds’  last  basketball  game 
could  easily  be  compared  to  David  and 
Goliath,  except  this  time  David  did  not 
win. 

The  Chilicothe  Hornets,  now  12- 
2, .are  ranked  fourth  in  the  state  and 
are  undefeated  in  the  Midland  Empire 
Conference. 

Compare  that  to  a  relatively  inex¬ 
perienced  team  who  is  in  the  midst  of 
a  rebuilding  year,  and  one  would  think 
Maryville  did  not  stand  a  chance. 
However,  the  ’Hounds  did  not  give  up 
without  a  fight. 

“I  was  real  pleased  with  how  we 
played,”  ’Hounds’  coach  Jeff  Martin 
said.  “We  had  opportunity  at  the  end 
of  the  ballgame  to  win  the  game,  we 
just  ran  out  of  time.” 

The  ’  Hounds,  who  shot  just  29  per¬ 
cent  from  the  field,  cut  the  Hornet  lead 
to  five  with  about  three  minutes  left 
but  were  unable  to  close  out  the  game, 
losing  46-35. 

’Hounds’  center  Charity  Smail, 
who  had  been  averaging  over  20 
points  per  game  in  her  last  five  games, 
was  shut  down  to  only  12  by  the  Hor¬ 
nets’  defense. 

“Every  time  Charity  got  the  ball 
down  in  the  low  post  they  would  have 


two  or  three  people  just  suck  in  on 
her,”  Martin  said.  “They  made  it 
tough  for  her.  They  did  a  good  job  on 
her.”' 

Martin  said  he  was  very  proud  of 
his  team’s  effort  and  thinks  defense 
was  one  of  the  keys  to  its  success  so 
far  in  the  season. 

“We  played  our  best  defensive 
game  of  the  year  down  there,”  Mar¬ 
tin  said.  “Chillicothe  made  27  turn¬ 
overs  that  night.” 

The  ’Hounds,  I  -3  in  the  MEC  and 
9-9  overall,  now  turn  their  attention 
to  the  streaking  East  Buchanan  Bull¬ 
dogs.  The  Bulldogs  have  won  their 
last  seven  games  and  Martin  said  the 
game  should  be  a  close  one. 

“It  is  going  to  be  a  good  game; 
they’ve  got  some  good  players,”  Mar¬ 
tin  said.  “They  have  improved  a  lot, 
but  it  is  a  team  we  can  beat  if  we  play 
well.” 

While  the  team  is  focusing  on  one 
game  at  a  time,  Martin  is  still  look¬ 
ing  forward  to  districts  which  begin 
Feb.  24. 

Maryville  has  seven  opponents  on 
its  schedule  this  season,  and  Martin 
said  his  team  can  be  successful  in  dis¬ 
tricts  if  it  puts  together  a  good  string 
of  games. 

"We  feel  like  whoever  wins  the 
district  is  going  to  be  the  team  that 
puts  together  the  best  stretch  of  bas¬ 
ketball  during  the  week  of  districts,” 
Martin  said.  “We  could  be  one  of 
those  teams  if  we  make  the  effort  in 
all  these  ballgames  and  play  good 
defense  in  all  these  ballgames.”

Even  though  the  ’Hounds  can  look

according  to 
Wins  the  American 

_ Gelnosky  Heritage 

College 

Dictionary,  but  most  people  have 
their  own  definition  of  the  word  that 
doesn’t  resemble  this  one. 

Professional  athletes  and  profes¬ 
sional  sports  have  taken  a  bad  rap 
over  the  last  decade  or  so,  but  the 
problem  has  worsened  over  the  past 
year. 

The  Dallas  Cowboys  have  been 
the  main  culprit  with  the  suspensions 
of  players  because  of  drug  use  and 
run-ins  with  the  law  —  Eric  Will¬ 
iams,  Michael  Irvin  and  Leon  Lett 
just  to  name  a  few. 

The  most  recent  incident  was  in 
Minnesota  when  the  Chicago  Bulls’ 
Dennis  Rodman  kicked  a  camera 
man  on  the  baseline,  and  he  was 
suspended  and  fined  by  the  National 
Basketball  Association. 

Society  has  reached  the  point 
where  it  sees  these  hthletes  as  having 
bad  moral  judgement  and  as  being 
those  who  only  look  out  for  them¬ 
selves. 

Stereotypes  have  been  created  for 
athletes  no  matter  what  sport  they 
play,  what  sex  they  are  and  how' 
much  money  they  make. 

That’s  when  one  athlete  made-the 
headlines  last  week  and  stepped 
apart  from  all  other  “athletes.” 

Carlos  Rogers,  a  center  for  the 
Toronto  Raptors,  made  the  news 
across  the  country  last  week.  It 
wasn’t  because  he  was  arrested,  and 
he  didn’t  beat  up  a  fan  at  a  game 
either. 

Rogers’  29-year-old  sister,  Rene, 
was  admitted  to  the  Henry  Ford 
Hospital  in  Detroit,  Mich.,  awaiting  a 
kidney  transplant. 

After  an  unsuccessful  operation, 

Carlos  was  told  by  doctors  that  his 
sister  may  not  live  unless  he  donated 
one  of  his  kidneys. 

In  most  cases,  a  kidney  donor  is 
not  in  any  big  danger  because  a 
person  can  live  with  only  one  kidney, 
but  because  Carlos  is  a  professional 
athlete,  the  loss  of  a  kidney  would 
l*  cost  him  his  NBA  career.  “  ' 

At  age  26  and  only  his  third  year 
in  the  professional  ranks,  Carlos 
looked  to  have  a  bright  future  with 
an  expansion  team. 

When  Rene  went  into  critical 
condition  last  week;  Carlos  flew 
back  to  his  hometown  of  Detroit  to 
prepare  to  help  his  sister. 

Carlos  said  it  was  a  “no  brain 
decision”  whether  to  give  up  his 
career  or  not.  He  said  his  sister  was 
his  biggest  fan,  and  now  it  was  his 
turn  to  be  hers. 

Even  though  Rene  did  not  survive 
her  condition  and  Carlos  did  not 
have  the  opportunity  to  help  his 
sister,  it  is  still  a  great  story  of  love 
between  a  brother  and  sister. 

So  you  still  think  you  know  the 
definition  of  an  athlete? 

Well,  Carlos  Rogers  rewrote 
many  people’s  definition  in  the 
dictionary,  and  now  it’s  easy  to  see 
how  stereotypes  are  nothing  more 
than  just  that.

Mercedes 
Ramirfez 
talks 
about  her 
life,  her 
year  and 
her  future 


he  spent  over  a  month  as  a  patient  in  differ¬ 
ent  hospitals  at  the  start  of  1996,  and  now 
Mercedes  Ramirez  wants  to  go  back. 

As  an  international  business  major, 
Ramirez  hopes  to  someday  give  to  others  as 
an  administrator  in  a  major  hospital  and  just 
under  a  year  ago  she  couldn’t  wait  to  get  out 
of  the  hospital. 

i  As  one  of  four  survivors  of  an  American 
I  Airlines  crash  Dec.  20,  1995,  Ramirez  suf- 
I  fered  serious  injuries  to  her  abdomen,  and 
9  also  had  a  broken  thigh  and  a  broken  spine 
'  that  kept  her  in  a  hospital  in  Cali,  Columbia, 
for  10  days  and  at  Truman  Medical  Center 
in  Kansas  City,  Mo.,  for  five  weeks. 

Continuing  her  journey  to  give  to  others, 
Ramirez  is  hoping  to  work  for  the  insurance 
company,  where  she  has  interned  since  she 
was  in  high  school,  when  she  graduates  in 
January. 

“I  like  dealing  with  health  care  especially 
since  I  was  in  the  hospital  for  so  long,” 
Ramirez  said.  “Since  my  major  is  for  busi¬ 
ness,  I  can  see  the  aspect  of  paying  and  such, 
but  then  I  also  see  how  the  patient  feels  and 
how  they  are  treated.” 

Ramirez’s  extended  stay  last  January  was 
for  her  recovery  after  the  jetliner  crashed  in 
the  Colombian  mountains  on  her  21st  birth¬ 
day.  The  160  casualties  on  the  flight  included 
her  parents  Benjamin  and  Mercedes 
Ramirez.  They  were  on  their  way  to  spend 
Christmas  with  family  in  Colombia. 

“The  entire  experience  has  forced  me  to 
be  stronger  because  if  not,  I  would  not  have 
been  able  to  handle  going  through  this  situ¬ 
ation,  either  that  or  go  crazy,”  she  said.  “It’s 
up  to  me  to  overcome  my  obstacles  because 
I  can’t  really  depend  on  anybody  and  I  use  a 
lot  of  self  motivation.” 

Giving  to  Northwest  has  also  inspired 
Ramirez  in  many  ways.  Although  she  stays 
busy  with  a  full  load  of  classes,  Ramirez  also 
finds  time  to  give  tours  as  a  student  ambas¬ 
sador,  spend  time  with  her  Phi  Mu  sisters 
and  works  at  the  library  for  her  Presidential/ 
Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  scholarship. 

“This  semester  will  be  busy  but  fun  be¬ 
cause  instead  of  just  doing  the  regular  library 
job,  English  teachers  will  bring  their  students 
on  certain  days  to  learn  to  use  the  comput¬ 
ers,”  Ramirez  said.  “I  will  be  able  to  help 
out  with  that,  and  I  just  love  to  work  with 
people.” 

Her  ability  to  work  with  people  has  made 
her  time  at  Northwest  not  only  a  positive  ex¬ 
perience  but  her  second  family  as  well. 

“My  sister  went  to  the  University  of  Kan¬ 
sas  and  it  was  just  too  big,”  she  said.  “I  know 
she  felt  like  just  a  number  because  she  ended 
up  transferring  to  a  smaller  school  after  her 
first  year.  I  can’t  imagine  myself  at  any  other 
school  and  everybody  has  just  been  so  sup¬ 
portive  since  my  accident.  Teachers  who 
weren’t  even  my  teachers  sent  me  cards  and 
you  could  just  tell  that  people  were  con¬ 
cerned  about  me.  I  can’t  imagine  that  if  I  had 
gone  to  a  big  state  school  most  of  the  people 
probably  wouldn’t  even  known  my  name.” 

Coming  back  to  school  was  a  major  mo¬ 
tivation  for  her  steps  to  recovery. 

“For  a  while  I  used  a  cane  to  walk,  and 
some  of  my  friends  said  to  just  come  to 
Maryville  and  everyone  knew  why  I  had  it, 
but  I  was  kind  of  embarrassed  to  come  back 
like  that,”  she  said.  “So  it  was  a  motivation 
for  me  to  come  back  and  see  my  friends  as 
well  as  coming  to  as  much  of  a  normal  state 
as  possible.” 

Normal  is  something  Ramirez  strives  and 
continues  to  works  for. 

“My  leg  still  doesn’t  bend,”  she  said.  “I 
can  walk  for  exercise  and  do  a  lot  of  things 
that  I  used  to,  which  includes  the  Nordic 
Track,  and  I  used  to  work  with  my  physical 
therapy  in  the  athletic  department.” 

Her  physical  recovery  has  improved,  but 
the  emotional  healing  has  taken  time,  too. 
Ramirez  relies  on  her  sister  Sylvia  and 
Nicholas,  Sylvia’s  son,  who  live  in  Girard, 
Kan.,  as  well  as  her  friends  and  God. 

“I’ve  had  a  lot  of  support  from  my  sister 
and  friends,  and  we  just  talk  about  what’s 
wrong  and  things  like  that,”  she  said.  “It’s 
nice  to  see  that  people  are  willing  to  be  there 
to  listen.  I  try  not  to  talk  about  it  because  I 
think  about  the  person  listening  on  the  other 
side." 

Even  though  she  doesn’t  like  to  burden 
others,  Ramirez  always  makes  time  for  a 
friend. 

“There  are  only  a  select  few  that  I  do  talk 
to  about  it  and  I  know  they  will  always  be 
there  for  me,"  Ramirez  said.  “If  somebody 
goes  through  something  like  that  hopefully 


they  could  count  on  me,  too.  I  could  sympa¬ 
thize  with  them  because  I’ve  been  in  their 
shoes.” 

Although  she  has  had  an  enormous 
amount  of  support  from  her  family  and 
friends  throughout  the  past  year,  Ramirez 
now  finds  herself  a  more  independent  indi¬ 
vidual. 

“I  have  to  do  everything  on  my  own  now: 
Either  I  do  it  or  nothing  gets  done,”  she  said, 
“It  has  made  me  a  stronger  person  because 
now  I  don’t  have  good  old  mom  and  dad  to 
depend  on  to  do  something  for  me.” 

The  one-year  anniversary  of  the  plane 
crash  was  difficult  for  Ramirez,  but  she 
worked,  kept  busy  and  spent  the  holidays 
with  her  sister  and  boyfriend. 

She  attended  a  mass  in  her  parents’ 
memories  on  Dec.  21  at  St.  Patrick’s  Catho¬ 
lic  Church  in  Kansas  City.  The  phone  calls 
never  stopped  from  family  and  her  parents’ 
friends  on  the  tragic  anniversary. 

“It  was  hard,  but  I  am  just  trying  to  do 
what  I  know  my  my  parents  wanted  me  to 
do  because  I  can’t  put  my  life  on  hold,” 
Ramirez  said.  “They  were  positive  people, 
and  they  wouldn’t  want  me  to  sit  around  and 
feel  sonry  for  myself.” 

Ramirez’s  plans  are  to  graduate  in  Decem¬ 
ber  of  this  year  and  do  what  most  college 
graduates  do  —  find  a  job. 

“I  felt  so  much  support  from  my  teachers 
after  not  being  here  for  a  semester,”  she  said. 
"Especially  since  I  came  back  in  the  sum¬ 
mertime  it  was  an  adjustment  period  of  not 
being  in  school  to  having  a  full  load  again.  It 
was  nice  to  come  back  and  take  two  classes 
and  try  to  get  back  in  the  swing  of  things.” 

Things  are  going  smoothly  for  Ramirez, 
which  she  credits  to  the  support  of  her  friends 
at  Northwest. 

“It  was  just  so  nice  to  see  that  people  cared 
and  still  care,"  Ramirez  said.  “Every  now  and 
then  I  get  little  cards  to  tell  me  they  are  think¬ 
ing  of  me,  which  is  really  nice  and  it  helps.” 

The  extra  media  attention  for  her  birth¬ 
day  this  year  didn’t  help  when  all  the  sta- 


Gene  Cassell/  Photography  Director 

tions  called,  but  she  only  did  one  interview. 

“When  the  interview  was  done,  the  lady 
asked  me  if  I  was  going  to  hit  all  the  stations 
and  I  said  no  it’s  my  birthday,  I  want  to  carry 
on  as  normal,”  Ramirez  said.  “I  still  get 
.phone  calls  to  do  this  and  do  that,  but  I  am 
jUSt.trying  stay  away  from  all  of  that.”  ... 

Although  this  last  year  has  been  quite 
eventful  for  Ramiref,  iter  memories  of  her 
parents  continue  to  live  in  her  heart. 

“One  of  my  proudest  moments  was  when 
I  won  a  scholarship  in  high  school  —  it  was 
kind  of  like  they  had  the  debutantes  and  a 
competition  for  the  scholarship,"  she  said. 
“We  had  to  do  a  dance  with  our  fathers,  and 
so  we  had  to  practice  for  weeks.  Every  Sat¬ 
urday  we  had  to  go  with  our  dads  and  prac¬ 
tice  the  waltz  and  where  and  how  to  stand.  I 
won  first  place,  and  I  knew  that  my  parents 
were  really  excited. 

“It  was  something  I  worked  for,  not  like 
the  Royals  game,  which  was  a  big  deal  and  I 
was  honored,  but.I  really  didn’t  do  anything 
to  deserve  it  —  something  just  happened.” 

Ramirez  loves  to  spend  her  very  little  free 
time  to  relax,  listen  to  any  type  of  music  and 
write  to  her  family. 

"Everyone  has  kind  of  taken  me  under 
their  wings,  so  I  always  get  cards  and  letters 
from  aunts  and  cousins  from  everywhere  in 
Colombia  and  Nicaragua,”  she  said. 

A  memorial  park  was  made  in  Colombia 
in  honor  of  all  the  people  who  passed  away 
in  the  crash.  Ramirez  plans  to  visit  soon. 

“I  have  never  seen  my  parents’  grave,  but 
I  know  the  cemetery  because  most  of  my 
family  is  buried  there,”  she  said.  “I  have 
flown  a  couple  of  times  and  I  get  nervous, 
but  I  am  not  totally  relaxed  until  after  the 
take  off  and  the  landings.  But  I  do  plan  to 
visit  Colombia  soon." 

This  past  year  has  been  quite  eventful,  yet 
it  still  leaves  Ramirez  with  many  unanswered  ’ 
questions. 

"Out  of  all  the  people  in  that  flight  I  won¬ 
der  why  God  picked  me,”  Ramirez  said.  “I 
still  don’t  know  why.”

Your  Man  takes  in  the  big  game 


The  Stroller 

Yours  Truly 
gives 
awards  for 
the  best 
Super  Bowl 
commercials 
of  1997 


Special  note:  Dear  Pub  owners,  is  there 
anyway  Your  Man  can  get  a  special  kick  back 
for  the  number  of  times  your  fine,  fine 
establishment  was  mentioned  in  last  week’s 
adventure?  Just  curious. 

The  first  week  of  classes  has  come  and 
gone  and  yes,  I  did  manage  to  make  it  to  most 
of  them.  Surprise.  But  even  with  the  begin¬ 
ning  of  the  semester  here  Your  Man  still  had  . 
his  eyes  set  on  something  else  —  the  Super 
Bowl.  Or  just  another  excuse  for  students  and 
me  to  drink  like  it  was  a  Friday  night.  (By  the 
way  I  did  make  it  to  the  Pub,  but  no  more  free 
advertisements  until  I  get  reimbursed  with 
beer  by  the  management.) 

The  Super  Bowl  is  a  great  time,  and  Your 
Man  has  really  reaped  the  benefits  of  living 
off  campus.  You  all  know  how  this  is  an 
alcohol-free  living  environment,  right  kids? 

Living  off  campus  the  past  six  years  has 
really  opened  doors  of  opportunities.  Girls  in 
my  hole-in-the-wall  apartment  at  all  hours  of 
the  day,  the  maid  that  picks  up  after  me  and 
my  messy  roomie  Fred;  and  the  two  car 
garage  that  houses  my  brand  new  Chevy 
Camera.  Oh  hell,  all  of  that  information  is  for 
the  fantasy  column,  I’ll  have  to  use  all  that 
later  in  the  semester. 

Anyway,  back  to  reality. 

It  is  hard  to  watch  a  Super  Bowl  game  on  a 
14-inch  black  and  white  television  set,  much  , 
less  anything  else.  I  do  get  Showtime  free 
though.  Your  Man  just  has  to  watch  between 
the  lines  of  static.  But  it’s  worth  it. 

However,  as  pathetic  as  Your  Man’s  life 
has  been  since  the  day  I  left  the  birth  canal, 
there  are  some  much  less  fortunate  than  me. 

My  friends  Dean  and  Bob  actually  wanted  to 
come  over  and  watch  the  Super  Bowl  at  my 
one-bedroom  shack. 

There  was  an  advantage  to  the  bobsy-idiots 
coming  over.  They  had  fake  IDs  which  were 
used  to  buy  beer  for  the  afternoon,  and  I 
wasn’t  going  to  complain  since  Your  Man 
hasn’t  had  money  since  I  left  Colden  Hall  last 
week.  I  had  been  at  (insert  favorite  drinking 
place  here). 

So  they  arrived  with  the  start  of  the  first 
pregame  show  at  noon  and  we  drank  and 
drank  and  ate  and  ate.  It  was  truly  a  paradise, 
almost  as  much  fun  as  a  hillbilly  at  a  family 
reunion.  I  really  don’t  remember  much  of  the 
pregame  show  except  for  Terry  Bradshaw’s 
shining  head.  (That’s  not  a  bald  crack,  it’s 


really  not.) 

But  as  the  game  was  ready  to  start,  I  came 
to  and  sat  back  to  watch  a  NFC  butt-kicking. 
The  last  time  the  NFC  lost  a  Super  Bowl  was 
when  ZZ  Top  was  actually  cool.  Ironic  they 
were  one  of  the  halftime  performers,  wasn’t 
it? 

With  the  game  basically  being  over  by 
halftime,  the  commercials  seemed  to  take  on  a 
rather  entertaining  value  to  an  otherwise 
boring  game.  It  was  really  bad  since  Your  Man 
had  run  out  of  drinkage. 

So  with  that  in  mind,  Your  Man  would  like 
to  give  the  “Your  Man  Ad"  of  the  Super  Bowl 
to  the  chicken  crossing  the  road  Budweiser 
commercial.  I  guess  it  was  a  good  thing  those 
burping  frogs  weren’t  anywhere  near  New 
Orleans  or  they  could  have  become  an 
appetizer. 

A  close  second-place  award  goes  to  the 
bomber  birds  for  Nissan.  Do  birds  only  come 
out  like  that  after  a  car  is  washed? 

The  third-place  award  goes  to  the  new 
Budweiser  caveman  series. 

A  special  honorable  mention  goes  to  the 
Pepsi  commercial  early  in  the  afternoon  with 
the  baby  and  the  three  super  models.  That 
would  be  a  pleasant  first  memory  to  have,  but 
unfortunately  for  Your  Man,  the  first  thing  I 
remember  is  getting  slapped.  It’s  kind  of  like 
when  I  ask  someone  out  for  a  date. 

But  as  the  game  drew  to  a  close,  Your  Man 
thought  back  to  how  the  Patriots  must  have 
felt  being  the  underdogs  and  then  leading  for 
part  of  the  game,  then  watching  it  slip  away. 

I  remembered,  that  has  been  the  story  of 
my  life.  I  am  not  a  loser,  I  have  just  been 
blessed  with  a  substantial  amount  of  bad  luck. 

Kind  of  like  another  bar  in  town.  How  was 
business  with  the  liquor  inspector  and 
undercover  cops  roaming  around?  Speaking  of 
which,  what  qualifications  does  it  take  to  be  a 
liquor  inspector?  This  sounds  like  a  job  even 
Your  Man  could  do  without  much  of  a 
problem  at  all. 

Well,  America’s  Dumbest  Criminals  are 
coming  on  and  Your  Man  likes  to  look  for 
relatives.  Until  next  week,  keep  your  feet  on 
the  ground  unless  you  are  running  from  a 
greenman  in  a  sidewalk  sweeper  cleaning  the 
snow  off  of  the  ice  below. 

The  Stroller  has  been  a  tradition  at  Northwest  since 
1918.

Northwest  receives  highest  funding 


by  Jacob  DIPIetre _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Northwest  will  receive  more  money  than  any 
other  four-year  state  school  in  Missouri  from  Gov. 
Mel  Carnahan. 

The  University  received  a  10.1  percent  increase 
over  the  amount  received  last  fiscal  year.  Carnahan 
suggested  Northwest  receive  an  appropriation  of 
more  than  $25  million  total,  which  is  an  increase 
of  just  over  $2  million. 

As  a  large  part  of  the  increases,  $  1 .4  million  will 
be  used  for  Northwest’s  Mission  Enhancement  pro¬ 
posal.  Improving  the  electronic  campus,  imple¬ 
menting  Culture  of  Quality  to  all  aspects  of  the  Uni¬ 
versity  and  developing  an  educational  consortium 
are  all  parts  of  the  proposal. 

Across  the  state,  funds  allotted  to  higher  educa¬ 


tion  are  down.  Sen.  Sam  Graves,  R-Mo.,  said  the  rea¬ 
son  Northwest  received  the  largest  increase  is  in  part 
because  of  the  continuous  lobbying  on  the  part  of 
Graves  and  his  staff  and  University  President  Dean 
Hubbard.  Graves  said  ultimately  the  decision  made 
by  the  governor  is  for  various  factors. 

“I  never  know  for  sure  what  exactly  sways  the 
decision  of  allocating  the  money,”  Graves  said.  “I’ve 
complained  for  a  long  time  that  Northwest  gets  the 
short  end  of  the  deal  come  budget  time;  I  was  tickled 
to  see  this  turnaround  in  this  year’s  budget.” 

Hubbard  said  Northwest  received  the  desired 
amount  of  funds. 

“Initially  we  had  asked  for  the  money  over  three 
years,”  he  said.  “The  governor  gave  us  everything 
we  asked  for,  but  he  spread  it  over  four  years.” 

Hubbard  said  the  extra  year  is  not  a  problem  and 
the  University  is  willing  to  work  with  the  state. 


“Personally  I  feel  good  about  that,”  Hubbanj 
said.  “I  want  to  go  on  record  expressing  apprecia¬ 
tion  for  the  support  we  are  getting  from  both  the 
coordinating  board  and  the  governor.” 

While  Northwest  did  receive  an  increase  from 
last  year,  there  is  still  not  enough  money  for  cer¬ 
tain  projects.  Hubbard  said  Carnahan  did  not  agree 
with  the  Coordinating  Board  of  Higher  Education 
“On  just  simple  operating  of  the  University, 
higher  education  in  general  got  less  then  25  per¬ 
cent  of  what  the  board  recommended,”  he  said. 

Because  of  the  decrease  in  funds,  some  concerns 
have  been  raised  about  the  amount  of  renovations 
being  done  and  the  different  programs  on  campus. 
One  of  these  concerns  deals  with  faculty  salaries. 

Hubbard  said  faculty  members  might  not  receive 
what  they  want  now,  but  the  future  of  the  Univer¬ 
sity  is  more  important  than  their  immediate  needs. 


“I  know  people  on  campus  arc  not  going  to  be 
excited  about  the  prospect  of  not  having  a  lot  of 
money  that  will  go  into  salaries  this  year,”  Hubbard 
said.  “But  the  future  well-being  of  this  institution 
has  to  be  more  important  to  us  then  the  immediate 
portion  of  the  budget  that  can  go  into  salaries.” 

Along  with  salaries,  concern  has  been  mentioned 
about  the  amount  of  renovations.  Hubbard  said  the 
money  for  renovations  comes  from  a  different  bud¬ 
get  and  will  continue  as  planned,  except  Garrett- 
Strong  which  will  be  delayed  for  at  least  a  year. 

“This  is  operating  money  the  renovations  are 
(paid  for)  capital  dollars,  that’s  another  fund,” 
Hubbard  said.  “This  year  we  got  $9.6  million,  next 
year  we  won’t  get  any.” 

Hubbard  said  the  reason  the  University  is  not 
getting  money  for  renovations  next  year  is  that  the 
state  will  channel  more  money  into  the  prisons.

'  Golf  proposal 
.  dies  at  Council 

by  Ruby  Dittmer  _ 


Community  News  Editor 

A  proposal  for  the  construction  of  a  golf  cart  storage  shed  at  Mozingo 
Lake  died  because  of  a  lack  of  a  second  motion  at  Wednesday  night’s 
Maryville  City  Council  meeting. 

Councilman  Bob  Huffman  presented  the  Council  with  the  proposal 

*  which  he,  and  City  Manager  David  Angerer  constructed.  The  proposed 
building  would  have  been  50  feet  by  99  feet  and  would  have  housed  64 
private  carts  and  an  additional  40  rental  carts.  Those  who  rented  space 
in  the  cart  shed  would  have  been  required  to  purchase  a  season  pass  for 
the  golf  course. 

Councilwoman  Bridget  Brown  opposed  the  shed  proposal  saying  it 
presented  a  risk.  She  also  said  the  city  has  an  obligation  to  taxpayers  to 
maintain  the  use  of  the  facility  at  a  high  level  while  maintaining  the 

,  revenue  at  the  same  high  level. 

Councilman  Dale  Mathes’s  main  concern  was  the  “total  project  that 
we  promised  the  people.”  Mathes  said  the  city  told  the  people  other 
projects  and  areas  in  the  park  would  also  be  developed  as  well  as  the 
golf  course. 

“We  promised  a  total  picture,”  Mathes  said.  “And  we’ve  got  to  keep 
focused  on  the  total  picture.”  . 

Some  members  of  the  community  were  not  pleased  with  the  Council’s 
decision. 

^  “I’m  surprised  .the  city  would  rather  sell  individual  fees  rather  than 
season  passes,”  local  resident  Mike  Foster  said. 

Huffman  was  also  disappointed  but  said  he  will  try  to  pass  a  similar 
proposal  in  the  future.  He  believed  there  were  two  other  Council  mem¬ 
bers  who  supported  the  proposal. 

Huffman  said  he  cannot  see  the  half-cent  tax  used  for  funding  the 
Mozingo  project  passing  again  without  the  storage  shed. 

“The  golfers  of  the  city  passed  the  tax  the  first  time,”  Huffman  said. 

In  other  news,  the  Rotary  Club  of  Mary  ville  proposed  to  build  a  bath- 

*  house  complete  with  showers  and  washers  and  dryers  at  the  Mozingo 
Lake  area.  The  club  asked  the  city  to  build  the  bathhouse  and  the  club

Max  Ruhl  was  appointed  dean  of  the 
University’s  College  of  Education  and  Hu¬ 
man  Services  by  the  Board  of  Regents  Jan. 
22. 

Prior  to  his  promotion,  Ruhl  served  as 
chairman  of  the  Department  of  Educational 
Leadership  for  seven  years. 

He  replaced  Joe  Ryan,  who  resigned 
Dec.  31  after  11  years  as  dean.  Ryan 
teaches  foreign  language  education  classes. 

“I  really  have  to  commend  my  prede¬ 
cessor,”  Ruhl  said.  “He  is  leaving  the  col¬ 
lege  in  a  strong  position.  He  showed  strong 
leadership  for  many  years.” 

Ruhl  will  have  a  variety  of  responsibili¬ 
ties  in  his  new  position.  The  College  of 
Education  and  Human  Services  includes 
the  departments  of  Educational  Leadership; 
Curriculum  and  Instruction;  Health,  Physi¬ 


cal  Education,  Recreation  and  Dance;  Psy¬ 
chology,  Sociology  and  Counseling;  and 
Human  Environmental  Sciences. 

“I’m  excited  to  be  working  with  a  ter¬ 
rific,  talented,  committed,  hard-working 
faculty,”  Ruhl  said.  “I  have  great  optimism 
for  the  things  we  are  going  to  accomplish.” 

Ruhl  will  hold  a  meeting  for  the  staff  to 
discuss  long-term  goals. 

“I’d  like  to  focus  their  attention  on 
teaching,”  he  said.  “They  have  a  lot  of  other 
responsibilities,  but  teaching  is  the  most 
important  and  deserves  the  most  time." 

Ruhl  plans  to  make  sure  the  faculty 
doesn’t  fall  behind. 

“I  will  focus  on  aggressive  staff  devel¬ 
opment,"  he  said.  “We  need  to  continue  to 
train  them  to  be  aware  of  the  latest  issues 
and  trends  in  teaching.” 

Ruhl  thinks  the  students  will  benefit  by 
using  the  latest  technologies  available. 

“The  students  should  have  as  many  op¬ 


portunities  as  we  can  give  them,”  Ruhl  said. 
“We  need  to  prepare  them  for  multimedia 
teaching.” 

He  said  that  he  would  also  like  to  in¬ 
crease  the  number  of  students  who  are 
placed  in  diverse  settings  for  student  teach¬ 
ing. 

“We  are  preparing  students  for  class¬ 
rooms  across  America,”  Ruhl  said.  “They 
need  to  know  how  to  handle  all  ranges  of 
students.” 

He  plans  on  congratulating  faculty  and 
students  when  they  do  well. 

“I  want  us  to  celebrate  the  success  of 
the  students  and  faculty,”  Ruhl  said.  “They 
need  to  recognize  that  good  things  come 
from  hard  work." 

The  Department  of  Educational  Lead¬ 
ership  conducted  an  internal  search  to  fill 
Ruhl’s  past  position  as  chair.  As  dean  of 
the  college,  Ruhl  will  make  the  final  deci¬ 
sion.

"Everything  I  do  is  as  a  member 
of  a  team,"  McGary  said.  “We  all 
have  our  areas  of  expertise  and  we 
work  together  for  a  positive  benefit.” 

The  Maryville  animal  shelter  was 
operated  by  the  city  before  the  Hu¬ 
mane  Society  took  over  the  manage¬ 
ment  and  operations. 

McGary  said  even  though  there 
are  many  contributors,  it  is  surpris¬ 
ing  how  much  money  is  needed  for 
the  upkeep  of  the  shelter. 

"I  feel  extremely  responsible  for 
all  of  the  money  spent  because  the 
funds  we  receive  come  out  of  the 
goodness  of  people’s  hearts,  dona¬ 
tions,  annual  dues,  fund-raisers  and 
the  city  of  Maryville  and  Nodaway 
County,"  McGary  said.  "The  city  has 


helping  educate  public  been  extremely  cooperative  and  sup- 
schools  and  providing  indi-  portive.” 


Though  pending  Regents  OK, 
University  plans  to  start  next 
evolution  of  computer  program 

by  Scott  Summers _ 

Chief  Reporter 

“We  are  in  the  process  of  looking  at  the 
options  we  have,"  provost  Tim  Gilmour,  said. 

Even  though  final  decisions  about  the  EC+ 
program  are  still  pending,  EC+  will  not  con¬ 
tinue  in  the  same  facet  that  it  has  over  the  last 
two  years. 

The  Board  of  Regents  will  discuss  the  pro¬ 
gram  during  its  February  meeting  and  debate 
what  changes  will  be  made. 

Gilmour  said  if  the  new  program  is  ap¬ 
proved  by  the  Board  of  Regents,  the  Univer¬ 
sity  would  not  abandon  the  students  who  have 
already  purchased  the  notebook  computers. 

"We  would  do  everything  we  can  to  main¬ 
tain  our  commitment  to  those  students," 
Gilmour  said.  “That  includes  offering  some 
courses  in  an  EC+  mode,  and  we  may  do  some 
other  things.” 

Northwest  will  continue  to  have  the  objec¬ 
tive  of  getting  technology  into  the  classrooms 
and  giving  students  a  chance  to  utilize  that 
technology. 

Douglas  Martin,  assistant  professor  of  psy¬ 
chology,  sociology  and  counseling,  said  EC+ 


was  a  very  beneficial  program  to  the  students 
and  teachers  involved. 

“I  liked  using  the  computers  in  my  class¬ 
room,"  he  said.  “It  helps  the  teaching  process.” 

Gilmour  said  the  University  will  continue 
to  put  teacher  stations  in  the  classrooms  and  it 
is  discussing  the  idea  of  creating  a  center  for 
the  development  of  applications. 

"We  will  continue  our  program  to  supply 
all  of  our  faculty  over  time  with  notebook  com¬ 
puters  to  use  in  the  classroom  and  outside  of 
the  classroom,”  Gilmour  said. 

EC+  is  still  a  great  concept,  Gilmour  said, 
but  the  Board  of  Regents  is  looking  for  ways 
to  make  it  more  accessible, 

"The  major  shortcoming  of  EC+  was  the 
cost,”  Gilmour  said.  "What  svc’re  doing  is 
evolving  the  program  into  something  that  will 
serve  more  students  and,  frankly,  is  a  little  bit 
more  cost  effective.” 

Martin  believes  if  EC+  is  sinking,  it  may 
be  because  Northwest  was  trying  to  bring  the 
program  along  too  fast. 

"I  think  perhaps  we  were  a  little  ahead  of 
our  lime,"  Martin  said.  "Over  time  (the  note¬ 
book  computers)  might  get  as  inexpensive  as 
a  pocket  calculator." 

If  the  prices  continue  to  drop  over  time, 
Martin  thinks  more  students  would  be  willing

OFTHE CAMPUS 


Food  prices  on  campus 
are  still  very  expensive 


After  the  holiday  season,  most 
people  are  checking  their  budgets  and 
counting  every  last  penny  just  to  make 
ends  meet. 

For  some  commuting  students  this 
is  not  the  only  time  money  is  tight, 
because  paying  for  food  on  campus 
has  many  eating  and  spending  spar¬ 
ingly. 

Only  $200  is  allotted  on  a 
commuter’s  food  plan.  For  many 
commuters,  money  runs  out 
quickly  and  it  seems  this  is 
mostly  the  result  of  high  ^ 

food  prices  or  not  enough 
money  on  the  plan. 

For  a  simple  meal, 
consisting  of  a  sandwich 
and  drink,  one  spends 
around  $5  —  about  the 
same  as  a  meal  eating  out.  It 
is  often  a  lot  cheaper  to  go 
home  and  make  a  sandwich, 
but  for  some  students  who 
have  to  be  on  campus  all 
day,  this  simply  isn’t  feasible. 

Students  with  regular  meal  plans 
often  end  up  with  extra  money  at  the 
end  of  the  semester.  Why  is  it  that 
commuters  have  so  much  trouble 
making  meal  money  last? 

A  single  piece  of  fruit  costs  $.60, 
whereas  one  can  buy  at  least  five  at 
the  grocery  store  for  the  same  price.  A 
12-ounce  bottle  of  water  costs  a 
dollar,  at  the  store,  a  gallon  of  distilled 
water  costs  $.73.  A  Rice  Crispy  treat 
is  over  a  dollar,  and  a  pan  of  them  at 
home  costs  less  and  lasts  longer. 


A  croissant  box  containing  carrots, 
grapes  and  a  sandwich  costs  $3.90, 
which  is  more  than  an  extra  value  meal 
at  McDonald’s  and  it  doesn’t  come 
with  a  drink.  Two  bagels  and  a  con¬ 
tainer  of  cream  cheese  cost  $3.50,  and 
to  many  students  these  prices  seem 
outragous. 

Campus  Dining  has  valid  reasons 
for  the  costs.  It  seems  much  of  the  cost 
comes  from  prices  of  equipment  such 
as  dish  washers  and  the  price  of  labor. 

Prices  are  competitive  with 
4*^*  local  fast-food  restaurants. 

”  '  For  instance,  a  32-ounce 

drink  is  $.10  cheaper  on 
campus  than  at  McDonald’s 
or  Hardee’s. 

But  for  those  who  would 
rather  eat  at  home,  feel  free  to 
do  so.  If  time  does  not  permit 
a  trip  home,  and  you  are 
forced  to  eat  on  campus,  the 
prices  are  as  they  stand. 

Campus  Dining  is  willing 
to  hear  the  complaints  of  the  con¬ 
cerned.  If  students  want  change,  they 
must  go  through  the  proper  channels. 
Contact  Campus  Dining  and  make  an 
appointment  to  discuss  your  concerns 
with  them,  or  join  the  Campus  Dining 
Committee  of  the  Residence  Hall 
Association.  Make  your  voice  heard 
where  it  will  count,  or  stop  complain¬ 
ing. 

Though  it  seems  there  is  no  solution 
for  the  pricing  problem,  some  more 
effort  to  attempt  to  find  a  common 
ground  would  be  appreciated.

GEE,  THESE  PRICES  ARE  SO  HIGH,  THEY’RE 
STARTING  TO  ATTRACT  THE  RITZY  CROWD 


Mvfum 

Intersection  should  signal  change 


Lonelle  R. 
Rathje 

Some 
drivers  on 
Highway  71 
have  a 
pure 
disregard 
for 

defensive 

driving 


The  sun  was  beginning  its  timid 
peck  through  the  clouds  as  I  was 
enjoying  a  calm,  serene  winter  day. 
Even  George  Strait,  as  I  recall,  was 
singing  me  a  song  on  the  car  radio. 

God  bless  George. 

The  day  had  the  typical  winter 
components:  Slush,  cool  tempera¬ 
tures  and  the  like  —  even  a  slow 
farmer  in  a  red  truck. 

To  be  specific,  it  was  a  1996 
Chevy. 

Nonetheless,  it  was  Dec.  27,  and  I 
was  slowly  edging  out  of  my  scenic, 
two-story  hillbilly  residence  on 
North  Dewey. 

Dodge  never  intended  Lonelle’s 
Daytona  to  brave  the  rough  and 
tough  Missouri  winters;  however,  it 
was  pulling  through  like  a  trooper. 

And  Lonelle  was  likewise  being  a 
trooper  —  driving  carefully,  as 
always,  to  the  malls  to  tackle  the 
onslaught  of  post-festive  shoppers. 

Armed  with  monetary  supple¬ 
ments  and  an  optimistic  attitude  that 
I  would  indeed  find  the  perfect  safe,  I 
graced  the  U.S.  Hwy.  71  bypass  and 
headed  south  to  the  greatness  of 
Kansas  City. 

Greatness  was  my  quest;  however, 
near  terror  was  what  I  found. 

For  the  record,  the  posted  speed 
limit  is  60  mph  along  the  bypass. 
Lonelle  was  traveling  a  steady  50 
mph  Inclement  weather  conditions, 
as  calm  as  they  were  that  day,  should 
still  signal  caution  for  any  driver  — 
regardless  of  how  well  drivers 
believe  their  vehicles  handle. 

Then  it  happened  —  right  at  the 


Hwy.  71  intersection  by  Kawasaki. 

Aq  event  that  was  to  place  my  world 
into  a  two-second  tailspin. 

I  always  slow  down  when  I 
approach  this  intersection,  as  I  had 
done  on  this  occasion.  Time  after  time 
I  have  seen  too  many  “defenseless” 
drivers  turn  onto  Business  71  with 
pure  disregard  for  the  southbound 
traffic. 

Whether  drivers  turning  onto 
Business  71  have  no  concept  of  just 
how  close  oncoming  traffic  can  reach 
them,  I  have  no  idea. 

However,  I  do  know  this:  The  ’96 
Chevy  sat  in  the  turning  lane  for 
several  seconds,  watched  as  I 
approached,  turned  toward  Business 
7 1  and  then  stopped  in  my  lane  —  as 
if  he  just  saw  me  and  didn’t  know 
what  to  do.  I  was  within  two  yards  of 
hitting  him  before  he. sped  up  and 
onto  Business  71. 

My  driving  excursion  to  my  post- 
festive  shopping  was  suddenly 
scarred. 

By  the  time  I  slammed  on  my 
brakes,  it  was  a  near  hit.  My  car 
entered  into  the  world  of  spinning 
360s  and  settled  to  a  stop  in  the 
middle  of  the  intersection. 

Where  was  the  red  Chevy?  Off  on 
his  merry  way  into  the  ’Ville. 

I’m  quite  aware  I  sound  bitter 
about  this,  particularly  when  there 
was  no  property  damage  or  injury 
involved. 

However,  what  makes  me  bitter  is 
that  I  see  potential  accidents  at  that 
intersection  frequently.  Not  tailspins 
like  mine,  but  the  speed  misjudgment 


of  oncoming  traffic. 

Maryville  Public  Safety  said  the 
intersection  sustained  only  eight 
accidents  since  the  bypass  opened 
in  1994  —  none  of  which  proved 
deadly.  On  average,  15-25  acci¬ 
dents  happen  per  month  within  the 
city  limits. 

In  light  of  the  latter,  the  eight 
sounds  miniscule.  However  when 
speed  is  taken  into  consideration  — 
highway  speed  compared  to  the 
speed  in  town  —  the  intersection 
could  prove  deadly  if  drivers  do  not 
exercise  caution. 

Lonelle’s  solution?  Not  signal 
lights  at  that  intersection,  but  a 
flashing  caution  light. 

A  spokesperson  from  the 
Missouri  Department  of  Transpor¬ 
tation  said  general  criteria  it  takes  » 
into  consideration  when  placing 
traffic  lights  is  not  only  the  amount 
of  traffic,  but  also  the  traffic 
turning  movements.  Individuals,  as 
well  as  cities,  are  welcome  to  voice 
road  concerns  to  the  department  for 
further  investigation. 

My  first  inclination  was  to  voice 
my  opinion  about  placing  signal 
lights  at  the  intersection,  however, 
after  the  transportation  department 
said  such  lights  placed  on  roads 
where  drivers  would  not  expect  to 
see  them  would  be  a  safety  hazard. 

In  essence,  must  we  wait  for  a 
deadly  accident  to  occur  before  we 
enact  change?

Motherly  advice  rings  true  for  freshman 


John 

Klzllarmut 

Never 
turn  your 
cheek  to  a 
mom-ism 


I  was  never  one  to  listen  to  my 
parents.  When  my  mother  told  me, 
“college  is  going  to  take  some 
getting  used  to,”  I  blew  it  off  as  just 
another  mom-ism.  You  know,  like  . 
“your  face  will  stick  that  way,”  or 
“try  it,  you’ll  like  it.” 

Well,  I  still  don’t  eat  brussels 
sprouts,  and  luckily,  my  face  didn’t 
stick  that  way. 

However,  on  my  way  to  class, 
one  of  mom’s  predictions  finally 
came  true. 

Dressed  in  enough  clothing  to 
hold  a  garage  sale,  I  headed  off  to 
the  Fine  Arts  building.  Being  careful 
to  avoid  the  many  dangers  of  the 
newly  funded  Northwest  tractor  pull, 
I  held  my  breath  to  not  inhale  any  of 
the  greenish  gas.  It  has  been  rumored 
to  impair  your  reproductive 
abilities.Suddenly,  as  my  vision  was 
restored,  I  realized  that  mom  was 
right  —  college  is  an  adjustment. 


By  now,  most  of  us  are  fully 
adjusted  (or  re-adjusted)  to  the  odd 
hours  and  the  new  food  groups  that 
are  related  to  college  life. 

However,  there  are  a  few  things 
about  home  I  have  been  taking  for 
granted. 

First  of  all,  not  all  of  the  dishes  are 
crescented  with  the  Bearcat  emblem, 
there  is  room  in  my  fridge  for  a  whole 
gallon  of  milk. and  my  coffeepot 
makes  fresh,  hot  coffee. 

There  are  more  than  two  outlets  in 
my  house.  In  fact,  there  are  more 
outlets  in  the  kitchen  alone.  The  water 
is  fresh  and  clear,  and  tastes  like, 
water. 

Speaking  of  water,  when  I  take  a 
shower  at  home,  there  is  not  the 
slightest  chance  of  boiling  hot  water 
to  suddenly  come  out  of  the  shower 
head  with  absolutely  no  warnii^.  I 
really  miss  that. 

About  the  bathroom,  I  have  never 


had  to  revive  a  drunken,  vomiting 
teenager  who  has  nearly  died  while 
blowing  bubbles  in  my  toilet  for 
three  hours  so  that  I  can  use  it. 

Lastly,  I  really  miss  my  front 
lawn.  Who  would  have  thought  that 
a  bunch  of  green  grass  could  have 
such  sentimental  value.  But  my 
front  lawn  is  special  —  it  still  has 
its  virginity. 

It  has  never  seen  a  whole  case  of 
empty  beer  cans,  or  smelled  of  cow 
feces.  It  is  just  fresh,  green,  happy 
grass,  resting  comfortably  under  a 
fluffy  winter  blanket. 

Well,  mom,  this  time  you  were 
right.  Feel  free  to  come  down  to 
tell  me  “I  told  you  so.”  You  can 
find  me  on  ice  skates,  headed  past 
the  library  on  my  way  to  another 
class.

Headline  misleads 


Dear  editor, 

Your  story  that  you  tilled  “Hit 
and  run  victim  suffers  head  in¬ 
jury"  is  misleading  to  your  read¬ 
ers.  When  you  title  it  “hit  and  run” 
readers  will  think  that  the  driver 
left  the  scene  of  the  accident, 
which  was  not  the  case.  1  think 
that  you  should  be  more  careful 
in  your  choice  of  wording  for  your 
headlines,  so  that  you  are  not  mis¬ 
leading  you  readers.

Atmosphere  upsets 

Dear  editor, 

I  wanted  to  comment  on  the  at¬ 
mosphere  of  a  certain  place  in 
Maryville,  that  being  the  Leaded 
Bean.  My  cousin  attended  North¬ 
west  two  semesters  ago  and  told 
me  about  a  great  place  called 
Gourmet  Pleasures.  He  suggested 
I  go  because  it  was  a  nice  place 
*lo  meet  up  with  friends,  do  some 
studying  or  listen  to  good  music 


such  as  Toni  Braxton,  Seal,  Ma¬ 
donna  and  other  artists. 

Instead,  when  I  got  here  last 
semester,  all  I  found  when  1 
walked  into  the  Leaded  Bean  was 
that  1  was  being  judged  because  1 
represent  a  “normal”  looking  and 
acting  customer.  There  never 
seems  to  be  anyone  who  will 
come  up  to  me  and  start  a  con¬ 
versation  or  ask  to  play  a  game. 
This  is  sure  different  from  other 
coffeehouses  which  have  been  a 
lot  friendlier.  Perhaps  Maryville 
should  reconsider  having  such  an 
establishment  if  it  isn’t  going  to 
he  offered  right,  or  if  the  town 
isn’t  going  to  offer  an  alternative 
to  the  "grunge"  scene.

Partying  does  not  need  alcoholic  ingredients 


Bridget 
_ Brown 

Recent 
summons 
shows 
lack  of 
responsibility 


Over  a  year  ago,  after  much  discussion 
and  with  a  great  deal  of  participation,  the 
City  Council  made  it  illegal  for  anyone 
under  the  age  19  to  be  on  the  premises  of 
a  business  whose  major  source  of  revenue 
was  the  sale  of  alcohol.  Generally  this 
compromise  decision  met  with  approval 
of  a  wide  range  of  residents.  Naive  as  it 
may  seem  to  some  of  you,  I  accepted  the 
input  of  students  under  the  age  of  2 1  who 
pleaded  that  they  had  no  intention  of 
breaking  the  law  by  drinking  underage, 
but  wished  to  “be  with  friends.”  Bar 
owners  of  some  of  your  favorite  places 
have  taken  the  law  and  its  consequences 
seriously.  I  hope  you  are  doing  the  same. 

Recently  there  were  a  number  of 
summons  issued  to  persons  under  the  age 
of  19  in  local  bars.  Is  that  grumbling  I 
hear?  “Not  fair.  There’s  nothing  else  to  do. 
We  can’t  have  house  parties.” 

A.)  Life  is  not  fair.  B.)  Get  a  life. 


There’s  more  life  than  a  local  tavern.  C.) 
House  parties  can  happen  quite  legally 
with  no  alcohol  and  no  disturbing  the 
peace.  Some  of  the  same  people  who  told 
me  as  we  were  deciding  this  issue  they  just 
wanted  to  hang  out  with  their  friends,  not 
break  the  law  were  also  the  ones  saying, 
“Hey,  without  alcohol  there  is  no  party.” 

Risking  serving  up  a  sermon  I  ask  you 
to  look  around  and  sec  the  destruction  of 
lives  the  abuse  of  alcohol  is  causing-You 
may  not  have  to  look  as  far  away  as  you 
think.  My  cooperation  is  giving  any  of  you 
a  head  start  in  the  land  of  irresponsibility  is 
not  an  intentional  one. 

Please  respect  the  law,  be  responsible 
enough  to  do  what  you  are  asked.  Be  19  or 
20  before  you  visit  the  bars  to  hang  with 
your  friends  and  do  not  drink  until  you  are 
of  the  legal  age.  Do  not  blame  the  bar 
owners  or  the  police  for  you  getting  caught 
breaking  the  law.  Responsibility  begins 


right  here  with  the  letter  “I.”  The  bar  owner 
keeping  you  out  becomes  unpopular  and 
the  one  letting  you  in  becomes  popular 
when  you  blame  him  for  your  choice  to 
break  the  law  and  pay  the  fines.  That  bar 
owner  risks  more  than  popularity.  They  risk 
losing  the  right  to  do  business  with 
anybody  at  all. 

If  each  of  us  makes  ethical  choices,  we 
contribute  to  greater  freedom  by  restricting 
ourselves  rather  than  begging  external 
restriction.  There  are  so  many  ways  you 
can  and  will  test  your  wings  in  these 
college  years.  I  hope  your  thirst  for 
changing  the  world  you  have  inherited 
extends  to  more  significant  issues  than  this 
one.  Pick  your  challenges  to  law  carefully, 
not  by  breaking  the  law  but  by  changing  it 
or  choosing  to  obey  it. 

Bridget  Brown  la  the  mayor  pro-tem  of  the  Maryville 
City  Council.

As 

Valentine’s 

Day 

approaches, 
watch  out 
for  Cupid’s 
arrow 


It’s  that  time  of  the  year  when  Cupid 
starts  madly  snapping  his  love  arrows  at 
couples  around  the  world,  pursuing  his 
goal  to  make  people  “fall  in  love.”  But  are 
you  prepared  for  this  Valentine’s  Day? 

I  know  what  some  of  you  are  thinking. 
You’ve  watched  Cupid’s  arrow  zip  past 
you  and  hit  someone  else  and  wonder  if 
this  Valentine’s  will  be  any  different  from 
the  rest.  Well,  don’t  get  discouraged.  I’ve 
seen  Cupid  mistakenly  miss  me  too.  But 
after  being  hit  hard  with  one  of  his  love 
arrows  this  year,  I  believe  that  there  is 
hope  for  everyone. 

However,  poor  Cupid  may  be  thinking 
otherwise.  I  mean,  look  at  how  the  world 
deals  with  love  and  the  opposite  sex. 
We’ve  even  got  books  telling  us  how  to 
understand  each  other,  how  to  fall  in  love 
or  how  to  build  a  lasting  relationship. 

Let’s  be  rational  —  we  will  NEVER 
understand  the  opposite  sex.  Instead,  we 
need  to  just  accept  how  the  other  acts  and 
feels,  without  getting  aggravated. 

Sometimes  love  just  doesn’t  work  out 
or  it  just  wasn’t  with  the  right  person. 
Don’t  blame  it  on  Cupid,  even  he  makes 
mistakes. 

Another  possibility  is  the  one  miracu¬ 
lous  feat  that  everyone  claims  is  infeasible 
—  Love  at  first  sight.  Your  eyes  met  and 
then  you  unbelievably  heard  yourself  say, 
“I’m  not  ready  to  get  involved”  or  “my 
life  is  too  busy  for  love.”  Needless  to  say, 
Cupid  has  his  work  cut  out  for  him  this 
year.  Now  that  planners  are  found  in  every 
school  bag  and  briefcase,  society 
shouldn’t  have  any,  problem  writing  in  a 
time  to  fall  in  love.  Chill  out  everyone. 

It  was  during  the  third  century  when 
Christianity  was  being  persecuted  that 


Roman  Emperor  Claudius  II  outlawed 
marriage,  claiming  it  decreased  a  young 
soldier’s  desire  for  war.  Despite  the 
emperor’s  decree,  a  priest  and  physician  by 
the  name  of  Valentine  secretly  continued  to 
unite  couples  in  holy  matrimony.  On  Feb. 
14,  Valentine  was  beheaded  for  his 
compassion  and  commitment  to  Christian¬ 
ity  and  young  love.  According  to  legend, 
lovers  around  the  world  have  been  cel¬ 
ebrating  the  memory  of  Valentine  ever 
since  and  it’s  about  time  that  we  do  the 
same. 

Like  Christmas,  we’re  forgetting  the 
true  meaning  of  the  holiday.  Valentine’s 
Day  isn’t  about  gifts,  it’s  about  telling  your 
boyfriend,  girlfriend,  family,  friends  and 
maybe  even  your  dog  that  you  love  them. 
Although  roses,  candy,  love  letters  and 
even  diamonds  (go  get’em  girls)  are  great 
to  get. 

Remember  how  easy  it  was  to  like 
someone  in  grade  school?  I  would  do 
anything  to  go  back  to  the  second  grade 
where  we  made  valentine  card  holders  out 
of  old  shoe  boxes  and  all  week  we  would 
secretly  slip  Batman  or  Barbie  valentines 
into  someone’s  box.  Exhilaration  and  a 
sugar  high  would  rush  through  me  as  I 
would  rip  open  the  cards  one  by  one  during 
our  Valentine’s  Day  party. 

“You’re  out  of  this  world  Valentine”  or 
“Will  you  be  my  Valentine?”  piled  up  on 
my  desk.  If  I  was  really  lucky,  I  would  get 
at  least  one  card  from  a  boy  that  said  “I 
like  shooting  rubber  bands  at  you”  on  the 
back.  Those  were  always  my  favorite 
because  my  mother  said  when  a  boy  picked 
on  you,  that’s  when  he  really  liked  you. 

Oh,  how  love  used  to  be  so  easy  and 
cute.  Now  that  we  are  older  it’s  more 


difficult  to  get  excited  about  opening  a  card 
or  falling  in  love.  Insecurity,  fear  and  a 
painful  past  keep  us  from  falling  head  over 
heels  in  love  with  somebody.  All  three  of 
these  elements  kept  me  from  getting 
involved  in  the  past.  If  it  wasn’t  for  them  I 
wouldn’t  have  fallen  in  love  with  who  I’m 
with  now.  After  a  year  of  learning  to 
understand  and  put  up  with  my  ever-so- 
changing  hormones  and  allowing  me  to 
accept  the  idea  that  someone  can  love  me,  I 
realized  that  all  along  I  was  just  meeting 
the  wrong  guys. 

I  believe  there’s  someone  out  there  for 
everyone.  Someone  who  will  forgive  you 
countless  of  times  and  never  remind  you  of 
it,  who  is  always  concerning  themselves 
with  your  happiness  and  who  only  wants  to 
share  every  minute  of  his  or  her  life  with 
you. 

For  some  of  you  like  myself  that  have 
found  that  special  someone,  don’t  ever  let 
them  go  and  let  them  know  this  February 
14  just  how  much  you  love  them. 

Maybe  take  this  day  to  give  mom  and 
dad  or  grandma  and  grandpa  a  call  just  to 
say  I  love  you  or  look  back  on  the  things 
you’ve  taken  for  granted  in  the  past  and 
find  it  in  your  heart  to  start  believing  in 
love,  family  and  God  again. 

As  part  of  a  poem  from  an  anonymous 
writer  said  “To  believe  is  to  embrace  the 
value  of  a  nurturing  heart,  the  innocence  of 
a  child’s  eyes  and  the  beauty  of  an  aging 
.  hand,  fo*r  it  is  thought  their  teachings  we 
learn  how  to  love.” 

I  love  you  all  and  have  a  Happy  -  '  • 
Valentine’s  Day.

How  will  the  location  for  the  new  school  site  affect  your  vote  on  April  1? 


“I  don’t  think 
the  new 
location  will 
make  that  big 
of  difference 
because  the 
fact  remains 
that  the  people 
of  Maryville 
don’t  want  to 
pay  more 
taxes.” 

Steve  Welbleun, 
Maryville 
resident 


“I  don’t  think 
it  is 

necessarily  a 
question  of 
location  so 
much  as 
taxation. 
People  are 
tired  of  being 
taxed.” 
John  Campbell, 
Peak 

Entertainment 


“I  think  it  would 
be  better  than  the 
other  plan 
because  it  is 
more  in  the  same 
area  and  they 
can  overlap  by 
using  the  spine 
facilities  at 
different  times. 
We  can  save  a 
lot  of  money  and 
I  think  the 
children  would 
be  safer  in  just 
that  one  spot.” 
Doris  Swalley, 
retired  Maryville 
resident 


“I  think  we 
possibly  need 
a  new  school, 
but  I  do  not 
think  they  are 
telling  us 
everything  we 
need  to 
know.” 

Joseph  Swalley, 
retired 
Maryville 
resident 


“I  hope  that  it 
results  in  a  more 
positive  outcome 
at  the  schools.  I 
don’t  think  the 
new  location 
down  by  the  high 
school  is  any 
better  than  the 
location  they 
currently  have, 
but  I  hope  that  it 
will  be  a  positive 
change  to  enough 
people  that  it  will 
pass  the  issue  and 
I  will  support  it  at 
either  location.”

Happenings  in  Jefferson  City  may

Angerersaid.  Currently  there  are  nine 
bills  that  would  repeal  or  eliminate  the 
sales  tax  on  food.  Angerer  said  this 
would  be  bad  for  the  city. 

“Twenty-five  percent  of  the  sales 
tax  income  comes  from  food  tax,” 
Angerer  said. 

The  city  manager  also  estimated 
that  this  would  eliminate  $282,000  in 
municipal  dollars  and  $140,000  from 
the  Mozingo  Lake  project. 

Angerer  is  going  to  write  a  letter 
to  local  representatives  expressing  the

want  to  buy  the  notebook  computers.

Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation,  Inc. 

P.O.  Box  31438  •  Cincinnati,  OH  45231 
Tel:  (513)  931-1872 
Fax:  (513)  931-1873 


Dear  Prospective  Member: 

Liberia  should  have  a  special  place  in  the  conscience  of  the  United  States  of  America.  Its  impetus  to  become  a  nation  came  from  the  United  States.  For  149  years,  it  was  a  stalwart 
ally  of  the  United  States.  Yet  for  the  past  years,  as  a  civil  war  has  taken  almost  200,000  lives,  displaced  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  population  and  destroyed  its  infrastructure,  the 
United  States  has  treated  this  great  tragedy  as  a  regional  problem. 

Liberia  has  a  unique  historical  and  cultural  link  to  the  United  States.  Settled  by  African  Americans,  many  of  them  former  slaves,  in  the  early  decades  of  the  19th  century,  Liberian 
became  a  republic  in  1847.  The  United  States  influence  on  Liberia  is  reflected  in  the  African  nation’s  constitution  ,  the  star  and  stripes  of  its  red,  white  and  blue  flag,  the  structure  of  its 
government,  the  names  of  its  cities,  its  schools’  curriculum,  its  official  language  and  the  remarkable  degree  of  good  will  its  citizens  feel  toward  America.  Through  all  the  major  conflicts 
of  the  20th  century,  Liberians  been  among  the  most  dependable  allies  of  the  United  States.  In  both  World  Ward,  Liberia  declared  war  on  the  enemies  of  the  United  States  and  offered 
vital  air  bases,,  ports,  and  natural  resources  to  support  the  United  States  military.  During  the  Cold  War,  Liberia  voted  with  the  United  States  on  every  significant  resolution  at  the  United 
Nations.  It  hosted  facilities  for  electronic  monitoring  and  became  the  largest  base  for  United  States  intelligence-gathering  in  Africa. 

Yet  when  Liberia’s  security  was  most  at  risk  because  of  civil  conflict  the  United  States  government  deferred  to  ECOWAS,  an  under-funded  regional  organization  composed  of 
some  of  the  world’s  poorest  nations.  Half  of  the  $10  million  earmarked  by  the  United  States  to  support  a  peacekeeping  force  had  not  been  committed  by  April  1996.  Meanwhile,  the  cost 
to  the  United  States  of  responding  to  the  humanitarian  crisis  since  1990  has  been  emergency  relief  assistance  valued  at  over  $445  million,  over  $66  million  provided  in  the  past  year 
alone,  more  than  eight  times  the  amount  committed  to  peacekeeping. 

In  the  absence  of  a  viable  security  plan,  the  torrent  of  refugees  continues  to  undermine  Liberia’s  relations  with  its  immediate  neighbors.  Though  the  United  States  has  imported 
those  nations  to  admit  Liberian  refugees,  its  own  record  of  Liberian  admissions  decries  the  long  relationship  with  that  nation. 

The  approach  to  achieving  peace  in  Liberian  has  revolved  around  the  ECOWAS  process  for  six  years.  This  process  has,  in  turn  ,  been  dependent  on  a  core  group  of  ECOWAS 
nations  with  the  will  and  very  limited  resources  to  engage  in  diplomacy  tour  to  committee  forces  for  peacekeeping.  Fourteen  peace  agreements  have  been  largely  brokered  without  the 
United  States  and  other  international  parties,  such  as  the  United  Nations  or  OAU,  present  with  ECOWAS  as  working  partners  at  the  negotiating  table.  The  result  of  this  agreements  and 
the  resources,  and  leverage,  necessary  for  successful  implementation,  produced  the  tragic  results  that  we  have  witnessed  in  Liberia. 

On  August  17  the  Economic  Community  of  West  African  States  (ECOWAS)  concluded  meeting  that  provide  a  new  timetable  for  the  peace  process.  Starting  August  20,  the  warring 
factions  are  to  observe  a  cease-fire,  dismantle  checkpoints  and  withdraw  from  zones  of  combat.  The  peacekeeping  force,  expanding  from  8500  to  18,000  troops,  is  to  deploy  throughout 
Liberia  in  November.  Demobilization  is  to  be  completed  by  January  31.  Elections  are  to  be  held  on  May  31  with  a  turnover  to  an  elected  government  on  June  15.  The  revised  plan  calls 
for  sanctions  against  members  of  the  warring  factions  that  obstruct  the  peace  process.  Sanctions  include  restrictions  on  travel,  freeze  on  economic  activities,  exclusion  from  electoral 
process,  and  war  crime  charges. 

Now  the  United  States  has  another  opportunity  to  assert  its  international  leadership  at  a  critical  juncture  to  ensure  that  the  success  of  the  new  peace  process.  This  leadership  will  not 
lead  to  an  involvement  of  United  States  troops.  It  does  mean  that  the  Unites  States  must  heighten  its  diplomatic  efforts  to  help  coordinate  the  process  of  peace,  and  gather  the  funding 
that  is  necessary  for  effective  peacekeeping  an  demobilization  in  Liberia. 

The  United  States  should  take  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  its  commitment  of  $30  million  to  support  the  ECOMOG  peacekeeping  force  is  obligated  before  the  end  of  the 
fiscal  year  1996.  While  the  United  States  pledge  of  $30  million  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction  it  will  not  alone  enable  a  doubling  of  ECOMOG  to  the  18,000  troops  necessary  for 
deployment  by  November.  It  is  vital  that  the  United  States  provide  additional  funds  to  make  up  this  shortfall  or  take  the  lead  to  obtain  significant  pledges  from  other  donor  countries..  A 
top  priority  of  the  United  States  should  be  the  implementation  of  a  serious  program  for  demobilizing  Liberia’s  combatants.  Regretfully,  no  additional  funding  has  been  pledged  by  the 
United  States  to  improve  what  was  an  inadequately  funded  and  designed  demobilization  plan.  In  fact,  some  of  the  funds  allocated  in  early  1996  for  reintegration  of  Liberia’s  60,000 
combatants  have  been  diverted  elsewhere.  The  United  States  should  take  the  lead  in  designing  a  comprehensive  demobilization  program.  This  program  will  not  involve  United  States 
troops,  but  should  include  the  resources  for  every  stage  of  demobilization  from  encampment  to  training  and  counseling  of  combatants.  A  contribution  of  $20  million  (non-food  related) 
from  the  United  States  will  provide  the  resources  necessary  to  initiate  a  well  conceived  demobilization  program  and  encourage  future  contributions  form  other  international  donors. 

President  Clinton  and  the  United  States  Congress  must  make  Liberia  a  priority  on  our  foreign  relations  agenda  in  Africa.  United  States  leadership  is  critical  if  the  key  elements  are 
to  be  achieved  on  schedule  under  the  new  peace  plan.  This  leadership  will  not  lead  to  an  involvement  of  United  States  troops.  It  does  mean  that  the  United  States  through  its  Special 
Envoy,  must  heighten  its  diplomatic  efforts  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  peace  process  and  gather  the  additional  resources  necessary  for  effective  peacekeeping  and 
demobilization. 

The  United  States  should  strengthen  the  response  of  the  international  community  to  the  needs  of  the  peace  process.  The  foundation  for  a  new  international  approach  to  the  peace 
process  already  exists  with  the  International  Contact  Group  for  Liberia,  the  group  of  donor  countries  that  have  pledged  support  to  the  peace  process.  The  concept  behind  the  ICGL 
should  be  expanded  to  a  tightly  coordinated  partnership  that  includes  the  United  States,  ECOWAS,  and  the  United  Nations.  This  high  level  of  cooperation  will  ensure  that  scarce 
resources  are  effectively  utilized. 

The  outbreak  of  fighting  in  Monrovia  in  April-May  of  1996  was  the  latest  in  a  series  of  clashes  in  Liberia’s  intractable  war.  During  the  past  nearly  seven  years,  the  war  has 
produced  shocking  humanitarian  conditions  for  Liberian  civilians.  The  most  recent  fighting  exacerbated  even  further  these  conditions.  Humanitarian  assistance  organizations  have  been 
Unable  to  deliver  food  and  other  emergency  services  because  of  the  fighting  in  Monrovia.  Their  resources  looted  by  gangs  of  combatants  and  the  safety  of  their  relief  workers 
threatened,  these  organizations  closed  or  dramatically  reduced  their  operations  in  Liberia. 

As  a  result  of  the  civil  war  in  Liberia,  an  estimated  800,000  Liberians  are  internally  displaced;  another  800,000  are  refugees  in  neighboring  countries  that  are  among  the  poorest  in 
the  world.  Approximately  50  percent  of  the  population  in  Monrovia,  upwards  of  350,000  persons,  were  forced  to  flee  their  homes  due  to  the  April-May  fighting  and  another  3,000  died. 
During  June-July  some  3,300  new  cases  of  cholera  were  reported  in  Monrovia  and  a  July  survey  found  malnutrition  rates  for  children  in  displaced  shelters  have  increased  up  to  25 
percent.  Now  that  the  dust  of  the  Civil  War  in  Liberia  is  settling  down,  an  era  of  a  NEW  LIBERIA  is  at  hand.  Whether  anyone  likes  it  or  not,  a  leadership  is  bound  to  emerge, 
supposedly  to  shoulder  the  national  responsibilities  of  politics  and  administration  and  to  ensure  the  continued  survival  of  the  Liberian  people  and  culture. 

That  such  leadership  will  be  genuine  and  committed  is  a  matter  that  you  as  Liberians  and  friends  of  Liberia  can  decide,  or  at  least  influence.  But  choosing  national  leadership  is  a 
serious  and  difficult  business.  In  Liberia,  bombed-out  homes  and  shops  are  painful  reminders  of  what  happens  when  leaders  are  chosen  unwisely.  We  cannot  allow  this  to  happen 
again.  This  is  why  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation  is  campaigning  for  PEACE,  SECURITY,  SOCIAL,  ECONOMIC,  EDUCATIONAL  AND  POLITICAL  JUSTICE  IN 
LIBERIA. 

The  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation  has  carefully  examines  the  administrative  and  operational  policies  of  both  the  past  and  present  administration  in  Liberia,  and  in  our  candid 
opinion,  much  more  needs  to  be  done  to  help  Liberia  go  in  the  direction  she  needs  to  go.  We  as  Liberians  must  try  to  have  a  positive  influence  on  the  selection  of  the  national  programs 
and  the  corresponding  leadership  which  will  inevitably  affect  our  lives  and  the  lives  of  our  people  for  many  year  to  come. 

My  fellow  Liberians  and  Friends  of  Liberia,  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation  has  embarked  on  a  mission  to  ensure  that  PEACE,  UNITY,  SECURITY,  FREEDOM  AND 
SOCIAL  JUSTICE  prevail  in  Liberia.  This  is  an  awesome  responsibility  that  can  only  occur  if  we  cooperate  as  a  team.  History  will  judge  us  not  by  what  we  say,  but  by  what  we  do. 
With  God  and  the  determined  mind,  there  is  nothing  we  cannot  achieve  for  our  Liberian  Society.  It  is  in  this  light  that  I  urge  you  to  support  and  contribute  to  the  Liberian  Social  Justice 
Foundation’s  programs. 

Liberia,  the  African  nation  established  in  the  1800s  by  freed  American  slaves,  has  been  tom  by  civil  war  since  1989.  What  does  the  Liberian  Civil  War  mean  to  Americans  in 
terms  of  health  care,  humanitarian  relief,  stability  throughout  Africa  and  the  continuation  of  missionary  work?  If  you  share  in  the  dream  of  pace  in  Liberia,  a  country  founded  upon 
American  ideals,  you  are  invited  to  become  more  informed  by  writing  to  the  LIBERIAN  SOCIAL  JUSTICE  FOUNDATION,  POST  OFFICE  BOX  31438,  CINCINNATI,  OHIO 
45231.  (513)931-1872. 

I  am  writing  to  introduce  you  to  the  Liberian  Social  Justice  Foundation,  Inc.,  a  broad-based  social  nonprofit  organization.  The  mission  of  the  LSJFI  is  two-fold:  we  are  dedicated

Committees  plan  Trimester  dates 


by  Wendy  Broker _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Trimester  discussions  are  expanding 
throughout  campus  and  until  the  University 
finds  the  money,  the  committees  will  continue 
to  meet. 

A  major  asset  to  the  trimester  is  the  year- 
round  usage  of  the  campus,  but  it  can’t  be 
decided  until  Gov.  Mel  Carnahan  and  the  Co¬ 
ordinating  Board  for  Higher  Education  dis¬ 
tribute  the  money. 

Annelle  Weymuth,  executive  assistant  to 
the  president,  said  until  the  legislators  decide, 
the  project  is  in  limbo. 

“If  the  legislators  are  willing  to  give  us 
money  for  heating  and  cooling  to  make  the 
campus  usable  year-round,  why  wouldn’t  we 
take  advantage  of  it?”  Weymuth  said. 

There  are  still  many  questions  unanswered, 
and  hopefully  the  interviews  will  answer 
some  of  them,  Weymuth  said. 

“We  need  more  information  right  now,” 
she  said.  “We  are  not  ignoring  questions,  we 
are  just  asking  questions  in  a  sequential  fash¬ 
ion.” 

Committees  will  begin  conducting  inter¬ 
views  with  other  public  colleges  that  use  the 
trimester  system. 

“We  will  be  contacting  10  universities  as 
part  of  an  investigation  into  the  advantages 
and  disadvantages  of  trimesters,  for  the  stu¬ 
dents,  faculty  and  campus  facilities  utiliza¬ 
tion,”  Weymuth  said.  “We  are  also  asking 
about  many  potential  problems  and  how  they 
dfealt  with  them.” 

Merry  McDonald,  professor  of  computer 
science  and  information  systems,  and  the 
other  calendar  committee  members  have  al¬ 


ready  gathered  information  from  other  cam¬ 
puses  to  create  three  sample  calendars. 

“We  took  sample  calendars  from  other 
schools  and  took  what  seemed  to  work  for 
them  and  implemented  it  in  ours,”  she  said. 
“We  intend  to  look  at  more,  and  get  more 
feedback  from  the  faculty  on  the  ones  we  al- . 
ready  have.  Right  now,  it’s  just  a  feasibility 
study.” 

McDonald  said  a  trimester  schedule  would 
cut  breaks  students  have  become  accustomed 
to. 

“If  you  are  trying  to  do  three  semesters  in 
a  year,  it’s  inevitable  to  shorten  breaks,  though 
nobody  likes  it,”  she  said. 

Weymuth  said  the  calendar  and  many  other 
factors  will  be  discussed  once  options  have 
been  discovered. 

“We  will  have  focus  groups  involving  stu¬ 
dent,  faculty  and  staff,  to  help  show  us  what 
they  want,”  she  said.  “We  want  this  to  be  posi¬ 
tive.  We  will  try  our  very  best  to  meet  the 
needs  of  everyone.” 

The  needs  are  being  considered  by  sev¬ 
eral  committees. 

“Our  committee’s  job  is  to  figure  out  how 
we  can  provide  for  students  and  their  aca¬ 
demic  needs,”  VanDyke,  dean  of  libraries  and 
chair  of  the  academic  and  curriculum  com¬ 
mittee,  said.  “This  could  involve  rethinking 
the  sequence  of  classes,  and  when  to  offer 
them,  a  real  shaking  up  of  something  we  have 
become  used  to.  Our  group  has  submitted  our 
concerns  in  the  form  of  a  four-page  docu¬ 
ment.” 

VanDyke  said  the  committees  are  analyz¬ 
ing  each  part  of  the  project.  , 

“We  are  looking  at  advantages  and  disad¬ 
vantages  with  our  needs  in  mind,”  she  said.

Chief  Reporter 

All  of  us  are  searching  for  some¬ 
thing  —  happiness,  love  and  money. 
Students  arc  either  looking  for  sum¬ 
mer  jobs,  internships,  or  in  the  case  of 
seniors,  permanent  job  placement. 

Career  Services  is  having  Spring 
Career  Day  from  1  p.m.  to  4  p.m.,  Feb. 
1 1 ,  in  the  Union  Ballroom  to  help  with 
this  search. 

A  Teacher  Placement  Day  will  be 
held  April  29  for  education  majors. 

The  businesses  attending  will  of¬ 
fer  opportunities  to  students  to  find  a 
job. 

Businesses  ranging  from  sporting 
good  stores  to  the  FBI  will  be  show¬ 
ing  their  wares  in  hope  of  finding  fu¬ 
ture  employees. 

Career  Services  send  over  3,000 
invitations,  but  only  80  businesses 
come  because  of  space,  placement 
clerk  Jcni  Crowder  said. 

“Gateway  2000  and  Sprint  arc  new 
this  year,  and  we  have  a  few  that  are 
adding  to  the  list  each  day,”  Crowder 
said.  “If  we  do  have  80,  it  will,  be  the 
biggest  we  have  ever  had.” 

Crowder  said  Career  Day,  despite 
popular  belief,  is  not  just  for  business 
and  agricultural  majors. 

“The  reason  several  majors  are  not 
represented  is  because  there  is  not 


enouglt  student  attendance  from 
people  in  those  majors  on  Career 
Day,”  she  said.  “However,  many  of  the 
business  companies  arc  not  just  look¬ 
ing  for  business  majors.  It  is  impor¬ 
tant  to  sec  what  they  arc  looking  for. 
You  might  be  surprised.” 

Crowder  said  Career  Day  has 
helped  students  find  employment  in 
the  past. 

"Last  year,  15  were  placed  and  that 
doesn’t  count  internships,”  she  said. 
“The  two  days  after  are  booked  solid 
for  interviews,  but  many  businesses 
arc  looking  for  upperclassmen  and  the 
turnout  is  mostly  freshmen  and  sopho¬ 
mores.” 

Career  Services  recommends  stu¬ 
dents  dress  appropriately  for  the  event. 

"Many  businesses  in  the  past  have 
complained  that  students  dress  too 
casually,”  Crowder  said.  “This  is  a 
little  more  serious  than  going  to  class, 
you  could  get  hired,  so  you  should 
present  yourself  in  a  professional  man¬ 
ner." 

Increased  student  attendance  at  Ca¬ 
reer  Day  would  increase  the  probabil¬ 
ity  of  more  businesses  attending  in  the 
future,  Crowder  said. 

“A  lot  of  businesses  come  because 
of  the  past  interest  shown  in  their 
field,”  she  said.  “If  we  could  show  the 
interest  in  more  areas  to  entice  com¬ 
panies,  more  may  come.”

Assistant  University  News  Editor 

The  job  he  does  has  not  changed, 
but  his  title  has. 

Bob  Bush,  formerly  the  vice  presi¬ 
dent  of  applied  research  and  the  insti¬ 
tute  for  quality  productivity,  is  now  the 
University’s  vice  president  for  re¬ 
gional  initiatives. 

Under  Bush’s  leadership,  North¬ 
west  has  worked  with  state  agencies, 
school  districts  and  corporations  to 
maintain  relationships  within  the  en¬ 
tire  region  of  northwest  Missouri 
through  numerous  projects. 

Some  of  these  programs  include 
the  Healthy  Communities  project 


which  focuses  on  improving  the  qual¬ 
ity  of  life  in  northwest  Missouri;  the 
Biomass  project  and  the  recent  formu¬ 
lation  of  the  Northwest  Missouri  Edu¬ 
cation  Consortium,  which  helps  bring 
post-secondary  education  to  people 
throughout  the  region. 

Bush  also  works  with  the  Missouri 
Western  State  College  graduate  cen¬ 
ter  and  helps  to  facilitate  distance 
learning  projects  through  the  campus 
in  St.  Joseph. 

A  familiar  face  locally,  Bush  works 
in  departments  such  as  Campus  Safety, 
CD  ROM  technology  which  helped 
lead  to  the  EC+  program  and  Univer¬ 
sity  grant  writing  for  faculty  and  staff. 


Nancy  Baxter,  University  grants 
director,  works  with  Bush  and  said  the 
new  title  helps  define  Bush’s  depart¬ 
ment. 

“It’s  perfect,”  she  said.  “It  appro¬ 
priately  identifies  what  he  has  been 
doing  for  years.” 

Baxter  also  said  the  title  should 
raise  awareness  of  the  applied  research 
department. 

“New  projects  should  come  this 
way  because  people  recognize  the 
importance  of  supporting  regional  ini¬ 
tiatives,”  Baxter  said. 

Bush  said  a  critical  issue  facing 
northwest  Missouri  is  the  decline  of 
opportunities  for  members  of  the  com¬ 


munity  once  they  have  completed  their 
college  degree. 

“This  region  needs  to  diversify  if 
we  are  going  to  survive  and  this  insti¬ 
tution  has  a  direct  relationship  to  that,” 
Bush  said.  “We  want  to  provide  op¬ 
portunities  which  can  be  shared  with 
everyone  throughout  the  region  and 
can  benefit  from  them.” 

Bush  said  the  new  title  has  been 
evolutionary  and  the  third  one  at 
Northwest. 

“I  have  a  very  fascinating  career 
with  lots  of  variety  and  new  ideas,” 
Bush  said.  ‘.‘I’m  very  fortunate,  I’ve 
always  felt  like  I’ve  had  one  of  the  best 
jobs  in  northwest  Missouri.”

With  (he  recent  snowfalls,  the  city 
of  Maryville  has  been  doing  every¬ 
thing  possible  to  keep  the  streets  clean 
and  safe,  but  it  definitely  has  been 
costly. 

The  relatively  small  storm  that  hit 
northwest  Missouri  last  week  cost  the 
city  approximately  $7,000  to  salt  and 
clean  many  of  the  streets. 

Since  Dec.  5,  which  was  when  the 
first  winter  storm  hit  Mary  ville,  ap¬ 
proximately  $21,600  has  been  spent 
on  numerous  hours  of  labor  and  ma¬ 
terials,  Ron  Brohammer,  assistant  city 
manager/director  of  Public  Works, 
said. 

“I  am  counting  regular  labor,  over¬ 
time  hours,  the  mix  used  on  the  roads, 
any  breakdowns  that  may  have  oc¬ 
curred,  the  fuel  needed  to  run  the 
trucks  and  tractors  and  other  expend¬ 
ables,”  Brohammer  said. 

The  city  has  already  used  close  to 
90  tons  of  mix,  which  contains  salt  and 
calcium  chloride,  on  just  this  last 
storm.  The  mix  costs  around  $12  per 
ton. 

In  order  to  pay  for  these  costs,  the 
city  uses  money  from  taxes  and  a 
street  budget,  but  snow  removal  is  not 
specified  in  this  budget. 


“We  do  not  budget  directly  for 
snow  removal,”  Brohammer  said. 
“The  bottom  line  is  that  we  will  spend 
whatever  it  takes. ..and  use  judgement 
and  common  sense  to  decide  how 
much  is  enough.” 

Often  there  are  consequences  to 
spending  more  money  than  is  allo¬ 
cated  in  the  budget,  even  though  it  is 
necessary.  Although  the  consequences 
do  not  come  in  the  form  of  tax  in¬ 
creases,  there  may  be  work  that  can¬ 
not  be  done  in  the  summer  because  of 
winter  spending. 

“Every  dollar  that  we  spend  in  the 
wintertime  on  salt  and  (labor)  hours 
and  time,  arc  dollars  that  can’t  be 
spent  on  additional  asphalt  on  streets 
and  those  kinds  of  things,”  Broham¬ 
mer  said. 

If  the  city  does  run  out  of  money, 
then  a  general  fund  will  be  utilized.  It 
is  money  that  is  pin  away  for  anything 
unexpected  that  may  occur. 

But,  in  most  cases,  the  city  has  not 
needed  to  tap  into  the  fund  and  has 
remained  within  the  budget. 

Although  this  winter’s  spending 
thus  far  is  slightly  higher  than  the 
1 995-96  total  of  $  1 7. 1 60,  Brohammer 
said  Maryville  will  do  its  best  to  meet 
the  goal  of  clearing  the  streets  the  best 
they  can  with  the  resources  and  funds 
allowed.

Babies  win  trophies 

by  Jacob  DIPIetre _ _ _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Many  parents  believe  their  baby  is  the  cutest.  However,  New  Star  Dis¬ 
covery  determined  the  most  beautiful  baby  at  a  regional  baby  contest  Sun¬ 
day  morning  at  the  Cardinal  Inn  in  Maryville. 

There  are  six  different  age  divisions  in  the  contest:  0-7  months,  8-14 
months,  15-23  months,  24-36  months,  3-4  years  old  and  5-6  years  old.  The 
contest  is  open  to  boys  and  girls,  each  having  their  own  categories  respec¬ 
tively. 

In  the  0-7  months  division  Brayden  Martin  of  Maryville  won  the  boys’ 
division.  Next  in  the  8-14  month  category  Mackenzy  Philett  won  on  the 
girls’  side,  while  Brady  Clements  won  for  the  boys.  In  the  15-23  month  age 
division  Cynthia  Smail  was  the  winner.  MaKenzy  Lawson  won  the  24-36 
month  age  division.  And  Tyler  Greeley  won  the  3-4  year  old  category. 

Colleen  Adams,  New  Star  Discovery  representative,  said  the  reason  for 
the  shortage  of  contestants  was  because  of  the  area  and  the  weather. 

“We  have  had  contests  with  anywhere  from  eight  to  1 37  contestants,” 
Adams  said.  “The  weather  was  real  bad  and  it  was  a  small  area  so  the  small 
number  was  expected.” 

The  most  beautiful  baby  winners  received  a  trophy,  a  crown,  their  entry 
fee  for  the  state  contest  and  a  photo  shoot  worth  $  1 50.  Awards  also  included 
children  with  the  prettiest  eyes,  best  head  shot  and  two  overall  high-point 
winners.  Regional  Director  Nancy  Skillett  said  judging  criteria  is  divided. 
Fifty  percent  was  natural  beauty  and  the  other  50  percent  was  personality.

trains,  mustang  for  parades 

by  Ruby  Pittmer _ 

Community  News  Editor 

For  more  than  30  years  it  has  been 
his  hobby  to  train  and  break  horses. 
However,  his  biggest  challenge  started 
in  September  1988  when  Sassy  ar¬ 
rived. 

Sassy  was  a  3-year-old  mustang 

*  horse  when  she  was  found  running 
wild  in  Nevada.  David  Dredge,  of 
Maryville,  purchased  her  for  $125  and 
transported  the  black  horse  to  Mis¬ 
souri  to  care  for  her. 

“I  just  thought  it  sounded  neat,” 
Dredge  said.  “I’ve  always  liked  horses 
and  training  them.  What  a  better  place 

*■  to  start  than  with  a  wild  one?” 

To  adopt  the  horse,  Dredge  con¬ 
tacted  the  Bureau  of  Land  Manage¬ 
ment  which  is  located  in  Jackson, 
Miss.  His  application  described  the 
specifications  of. the  horse’s  stall, 
along  with  general  information  about 
himself  and  why  he  wanted  the  endan¬ 
gered  species. 

•  Dredge  built  a  special  enclosed 
stall  that  was  10  feet  by  12  feet.  At¬ 
tached  to  this  stall  was  a  run  that  mea¬ 
sured  12  feet  by  20  feet.  He  built  a 
fence  at  least  six  feet  high  constructed 
out  of  wood.  The  fence  could  not  be 
wire  because  the  horse,  while  adjust¬ 
ing  to  captivity,  might  get  caught  and 

}  injured  in  the  wires. 

Patience  was  the  key  requirement 
when  he  broke  the  horse  in.  For  the 
first  months  of  her  captivity.  Dredge 
became  friends  with  the  horse. 

“It’s  a  slow  process,”  Dredge  said. 
“With  mustangs  you  just  don’t  walk 
up  to  them.  She  was  so  scared.” 

^  The  wild  horse  had  other  needs. 


Sassy  was  given  all  the  required  shots 
and  wormed.  She  also  had  to  be  given 
the  Coggins  Test,  which  checks  for 
diseases  prone  to  horses.  Because 
Sassy  was  in  the  wild  for  the  first  three 
years  of  her  life,  her  hooves  also  re¬ 
quired  more  trimmings  than  horses 
born  in  captivity. 

In  the  wild,  the  horse  fed  on  vari¬ 
ous  types  of  grasses  native  to  Nevada. 
While  in  captivity,  Sassy  learned  to 
eat  grains. 

“You  have  to  cut  down  on  the 
feed,”  Dredge  said.  “They  aren’t  used 
to  having  an  abundant  amount. 
They’ll  eat  about  anything  and  you 
have  to  control  their  intake  or  else 
they  will  overeat." 

For  one  year,  the  horse  was  in  a 
separate  stall  and  run. 

Dredge  said  after  becoming  friends 
with  Sassy,  the  rest  of  the  breaking 
and  training  “went  along  real  fast”  and 
he  was  able  to  put  a  saddle  and  bridle 
on  her. 

He  rode  the  horse  in  many  parades 
and  during  other  events.  He  also 
makes  presentations  to  scouters  and 
4-H  clubs. 

Dredge  said  purchasing  the  horse 
was  the  cheapest  part  of  his  hobby. 
Feed  costs  and  renovations  to  the  stall 
and  stable  were  more  expensive. 

‘T  ve  thought  about  getting  another 
wild  mustang,”  Dredge  said.  “Hind¬ 
sight  would  tell  me  to  get  a  yearling 
colt.  They  seem  to  be  easier  to  break.” 

Dredge  sold  Sassy  one  year  ago 
because  his  kids  had  grown  up  and 
there  was  no  one  there  to  ride  her. 
Fearing  she  would  become  ill  if  no' 
one  would  properly  exercise  the  ani¬ 
mal,  Marci  Gillis  bought  the  horse  for 
her  daughter,  Ashton,  to  ride  and  show 
in  4-H  programs. 

Dredge  recently  gave  a  presenta¬ 
tion  to  the  Nodaway  County  Girl 
Scouts.

School  Board  unites 


by  Lindsey  Corey _ 

Chief  Reporter 

Maryville  R-II  School  Board 
members  have  pulled  together  for  the 
April  1  bond  issue  and  are  expecting 
positive  results. 

“We  decided  to  put  forth  a  unified 
voice  and  not  our  individual  opin¬ 
ions,”  Board  member  Ray  Courter 
said. 

After  changing  the  proposed  site 
and  architectural  firm,  the  Board  is 
ready  to  begin  its  campaign  to  build 
a  new  middle  school  and  to  renovate 
the  elementary  school  and  the  high 
school. 

“One  of  the  top  complaints  (about 
previous  bond  issues)  was  the  site 
being  too  close  to  the  college,”  Board 
member  John  Redden  said.  “We’ve 
changed  that  soi  we  hope  it’ll  pass.” 

Change  hasibeeh  the  major  focus 
for  Board  members. 

“The  change  of  site  is  appealing 
to  many  voters  and  our  previous  ef¬ 
forts  gave  us  good  recognition,” 
Board  member  James  Redd  said.  “I’m 
very  optimistic.” 

Voters  are  more  likely  to  focus 
on  the  cost  of  the  bond  issue,  but 


Board  members  believe  there  is  no 
better  time  than  the  present  to  take 
advantage  of  the  opportunity  for 
progress. 

“It’s  really  not  a  question  of  if  we 
need  the  facility  and  improvements, 
but  when  we  .will  be  able  to  get 
started,”  Board  president  Rego  Jones 
said.  “There  is  nothing  we  can  do 
about  the  dollar  figure  because  costs 
never  seem  to  go  down.” 

Some  see  the  cost  of  the  bond  to 
be  a  bargain. 

“In  relation  to  the  previous  bond, 
(patrons)  are  receiving  more  for  their 
money,”  Redd  said.  “We  will  be  ad¬ 
dressing  three  facilities  to  help  chil¬ 
dren  all  through  the  system.  The 
longer  we  wait  the  more  pronounced 
our  needs  will  become  and  the  more 
expensive  it  will  be.” 

Board  members,  architects  and 
administrators  will  answer  questions 
at  9  a.m.,  Saturday,  at  Eugene  Field 
Elementary  School. 

“People  need  to  understand  the 
need  throughout  the  whole  district,” 
Jones  said.  “I’d  encourage  people  to 
go  to  the  presentation  and  make  up 
their  mind  there,  instead  of  rumors  or 
past  bond  issues.”

Time  could  not  run  fast  enough 
for  the  women’s  basketball  team 
when  it  played  Missouri  Western 
State  College  Wednesday  night. 

The  Bearcats  (8-10,  4-6  MIA  A) 
surged  ahead  63-59  on  a  layup  by 
junior  guard  Autumn  Fcakcr  with 
1 :52  left  to  play.  Western’s  Stephanie 
Jackson  answered  by  scoring  the  next 
three  points. 

After  senior  forward  Sandi  Ickcs 
missed  a  free  throw  with  36  seconds 
to  go,  the  Lady  Griffons’  Jenny  Marr, 
who  paced  her  team  with  1 8  points 
in  the  second  half,  gave  her  team' 
a  64-63  victory  with  a  layup. 

Head  coach 

Wayne  Winstead  //’  /p  ®*S

“There’s  no  miestinn  C 


44  percent  for  the  Griffons  but  only 
27  percent  from  the  free  throw  line, 
compared  to  Missouri  Western’s  61 
percent. 

Winstead  said  the  team  showed  pa¬ 
tience  on  offense. 

“We  played  well  and  did  the  things 
we  wanted  to,”  Winstead  said.  “We 
needed  a  break  here  and  there  and  it 
wasn’t  in  the  cards  as  far  as  calls  go.” 

Northwest  had  won  four  games  in 
a  row  at  home  before  the  loss  to  the 
Griffons.  The  loss  dropped  the  ’Cats 
record  at  home  this  season 
to  7-2.  North-west’s  record  at  Bear¬

“I  said,  ‘Let’s  just  take  the  best

(freshman  guard  Andrea  Robertson) 
was  fouled,  but  they  turned  around 
and  called  a  foul  on  us.” 

Senior  guard  Kristin  Folk  said  the 
team  was  trying  to  go  inside  on  the 
Final  shot. 

“Everyone  in  the  conference 
knows  our  strength  is  the  inside

Northwest  led  by  eight  at  half¬

as  10  with  16:21  to  go  in  the  game 
before  Western  tied  the  score  at  50

Griffons  slip  past  ’Cats  82-71

Chief  Reporter 

It  was  not  only,  a  big  weekend 
in  professional  sports,  i.e.  the  Su¬ 
per  Bowl,  but  the  men’s  and 
women’s  indoor  track  teams  were 
in  on  the  action  too,  showing  their 
abilities  against  competition  at  the 
Nebraska  Open  Saturday. 

The  women  displayed  some  of 
their  talent  in  senior  Heidi  Metz, 
who  broke  the  school  record  in  the 
3,000-mcter  run  by  nearly  1 0  sec¬ 
onds,  placing  third.  Junior  Kathy 
Kearns  finished  behind  Metz,  plac¬ 
ing  Fifth.  Junior  Julie  Humphreys 
finished  second  in  the  weight 
throw. 

Junior  Leslie  Dickherber  not 
only  placed  eighth  at  the  meet  in 
the  shot  put,  but  also  provisionally 
qualified  for  nationals.  Freshman 
Jill  Eppcnbaugh  also  threw  well 
Saturday,  grabbing  Fil  th  place  in  the 
shot  put. 

Coach  Ron  DeShon  said  he  held 
a  couple  of  the  season’s  top  per¬ 
formers  out  of  this  meet  (as  not  to 
tire  them  out  this  early  in  the  sea¬ 
son),  including  Jacshelle  Sasser. 

DeShon  said  he  is  taking  every¬ 
body,  an  A-team  and  a  B-team,  to 
the  team’s  next  meet  at  Central 
Missouri  State  University. 

“This  meet  coming  up  at 


CMSU,  the  Mule  Relays  is.  very 
important  at  this  point  of  the  sea¬ 
son,”  he  said.  “It  will  help  us  find 
out  where  we  stand  against  confer¬ 
ence  competition  and  if  we  are  con¬ 
tenders  or  pretenders  to  the  confer¬ 
ence  championship.” 

The  men’s  indoor  track  team 
had  its  share  of  stars  as  well  at  the 
Nebraska  Open. 

Team  co-captain  junior  Chad 
Sutton  finished  third  and  provision¬ 
ally  qualified  for  nationals  in  the 
high  jump,  Saturday.  Sophomore 
Jimmy  Jeffrey  performed  well  also, 
just  missing  provisional  qualifica¬ 
tion,  and  finished  4th  in  the  200- 
meter  dash  and  7th  in  the  55-meter 
dash. 

Coach  Rich  Alsup  said  he  was 
pleased  with  the  team’s  perfor- 
.  mance  Saturday. 

“I  thought  they  performed  well 
'  for  only  having  a  week  of  practice 
leading  up  to  it,”  Alsup  said. 

Sutton  said  the  team  will  im¬ 
prove  in  time. 

“As  time  goes  on,  we  will  im¬ 
prove  more  and  more,  and  be  in 
good  shape  to  be  competitive  at 
conference.”  Sutton  said. 

The  team  will  have  a  chance  to 
improve  in  Lawrence  when  it  faces 
the  University  of  Kansas,  Kansas 
State  University  and  Wichita  State 
University.

Missouri  Western’s  defensive  pressure  ale  the 
Bearcat  men  alive  Wednesday  night  and  the  ’Cats 
dropped  the  conference  game  82-71. 

“It’s  kind  of  like  sharks  around  blood,”  head  coach 
Steve  Tappmeyer  said,  commenting  on  Missouri 
Western’s  tenacious  defense. 

The  'Cats’  record  fell  to  7-11  overall  and  4-6  in 
MIAA  conference  play. 

The  Bearcats  had  their  fair  share  of  opportunities 
but  could  not  cash  in. 

“We  had  some  good  looks  at  the  basket,  but  we 
just  got  too  tentative,”  Tappmeyer  said. 

Northwest  was  not  going  to  roll  over  for  the  Grif¬ 
fons  and  the  ’Cats  held  a  39-36  halftime  lead. 

However,  the  Bearcats  were  a  completely  differ¬ 
ent  team  in  the  second  half. 

“It  was  like  night  and  day,”  senior  guard  Silas 
Williams  said.  “One  half  we  came  out  playing  and  in 
the  second  half  we  didn’t  play  with  the  same  enthusi¬ 
asm.” 

The  ’Cats  remained  within  striking  distance  until 
the  waning  moments,  but  they  were  outscored  22-12 
in  the  final  8:40  seconds  of  the  game. 

“We  didn’t  shoot  the  ball  as  comfortably  as  we  did 
in  the  First  half,”  Tappmeyer  said.  “I  thought  we  did 
shy  away  from  some  contact  at  times  in  the  ballgame.” 

Northwest  62  Missouri-Rolla  53 

The  Bearcats  traveled  to  Rolla  last  Saturday  for  a 
shootout  with  the  University  of  Missouri-Rolla  (11- 
6)  ballclub  and  came  away  with  a  62-53  victory. 

Tappmeyer  said  the  team  played  as  sharp  as  it  had 
all  season, 

“I  thought  we  probably  played  our  best  game  of 
the  year  so  far,”  Tappmeyer  said.  “They  had  a  big 
crowd  and  I  thought  we  kept  our  composure.” 

On  Saturday,  the  Bearcats  will  travel  to  Jefferson 
City  to  battle  Lincoln  University.

points  and 
dished  out  eight  assists,  while  achiev¬ 
ing  five  steals. 

Northwest  could  not  stop  the  play 
of  Missouri-Rolla’s  Heather 
Hartman.  Hartman  scored  a  game- 
high  26  points  and  tore  down  1 1  re¬ 
bounds. 

The  Bear-cats  will  try  to  snap  their 
three-game  losing  streak  when  they 
play  Lincoln  University  at  5:30  p.m. 
Saturday  in  Jefferson  City.  Northwest 
won  the  first  game  of  the  two  earlier 
this  year,  64-54. 

Folk  said  the  team  has  been  play¬ 
ing  Well  despite  the  slide. 

“We’ve  stayed  close  and  haven’t 
been  blown  out,”  Folk  said.  “We  just 
haven’t  really  gotten  the  breaks  we 
need.” 

The  women  will  hit  the  road  for  a 
long  three-game  road  trip  that  in¬ 
cludes  stops  at  Lincoln,  Missouri 
Southern  State  College  and  Emporia 
State  University.  Northwest  will  play 
three  games  in  Five  days. 

The  Bearcats  next  home  game  will 
be  against  Missouri  Southern  at  5:30 
p.m.  Saturday,  Feb.  8,  in  Bearcat 
Arena.

want  to  discuss  but  I’ll  start  at  the 
college  level. 

Lester  Earl  signed  a  national 
letter  of  intent  to  play  basketball  for 
four  years  at  Louisiana  State 
^University,  but  now  after  only  one 
semester  he  says  he  wants  to  transfer 
to  another  Division  I  school  —  the 
University  of  Kansas. 

Dale  Brown,  head  LSU  coach,  is 
refusing  to  allow  Earl  to  transfer.  If 
Brown  allows  Earl  to  transfer,  he 
would  lose  only  one  year  of  eligibil¬ 
ity.  But  if  Brown  refuses,  Earl  would 
lose  two  years  of  eligibility. 

I  think  it’s  about  time  Lester  paid 
the  price  for  his  actions,  so  I  hope 
coach  Brown  does  not  give  in. 

Then  what  about  the  situation  at 
Iowa  State  with  forward  Kenny 
Pratt,  the  Cyclones’  second  leading 
scorer  last  season? 

In  late  December,  he  was  out 
carousing  in  the  wee  hours  and  he 
got  hit  by  another  car.  Pratt  was 
drunk  at  the  time  of  the  accident  and 
was  arrested  for  drunken  driving 
after  he  failed  a  breathalizer  test.  But 
Pratt  decided  he  did  not  want  to  be 
arrested  and  resisted.  He  kicked  a 
police  officer  in  the  face,  loosening 
the  ofFicer’s  tooth. 

Pratt  was  immediately  kicked  off 
the  Iowa  State  basketball  team,  but  a 
university  committee  reinstated 
Pratt. 

Kenny  if  you  did  the  deed  then 
pay  the  price  and  sit  out  a  few 
games.  Once  again  this  is  another 
athlete  that  does  not  want  to  be  held 
accountable  for  his  actions. 

This  problem  not  only  affects 
college  athletes,  it  seems  to  be  a  big 
problem  on  the  professional  level  as 
well. 

What  about  Oksana  Baiul  and  her 
drunk  driving  charge?  She  said  she 
would  check  into  an  alcohol 
program  to  help  her  understand  her 
problem.  But  she  is  only  trying  to 
get  out  of  her  drunk  driving  charge. 

It’s  just  another  sign  of  an  athlete 
not  wanting  to  be  held  accountable 
for  their  actions. 

Players  like  these  can  ruin  the 
reputation  of  their  sports  and  I  think,  , 
'that  is  why  many  fans  are  becoming  ' 
disgusted  with  the  sports  world.

Boys’  basketball  squad  avenges  early  season  loss  to  Benton 

’ Hounds  rebound  from  conference  loss  at  Chillicothe;  solid  defense  leads  way  to  49-32  win  in  St.  Joseph  Tuesday 


by  Scott  Summers _ 

Chief  Reporter 

The  Benton  Cardinals  were  the 
most  recent  team  to  have  its  feathers 
ruffled  by  the  Spoofhound  boys’  bas¬ 
ketball  team,  losing  49-32  on  their 
home  court. 

Maryville  has  turned  its  season 
around  recently,  winning  five  Out  of 
its  last  six  games  and  improving  its 
overall  record  to  11-6  after  a  slug¬ 
gish  start  to  the  season. 


One  big  factor  in  the  Spoof- 
hounds’  recent  on-court  success  has 
been  their  tremendous  defensive  ef¬ 
fort. 

“I  think  we  played  great  defense,” 
Kuwitzky  said.  “Holding  them  to  32 
points  on  their  own  floor  was  a  re¬ 
ally  good  effort  on  our  part.” 

Kuwitzky  said  his  team  did  ex¬ 
actly  what  it  needed  to  do  to  beat  the 
Cardinals. 

“We  had  a  pretty  good  second  half 
of  taking  care  of  the  basketball,  and 


we  hit  our  free  throws,”  Kuwitzky 
said. 

The  leading  scorers  in  the  contest 
were  juniors  John  Otte  and  Adam 
Weldon,  each  reaching  double  figures 
with  12  points. 

Although  Kuwitzky  was  very 
happy  with  the  team’s  effort,  he  said 
the  ’Hounds  still  have  some  areas  of 
concern  to  deal  with. 

“We  need  to  strive  to  gain  some 
consistency  on  the  offensive  end,” 
Kuwitzky  said. 


Chillicothe  51  Maryville  42 

Maryville  found  out  the  hard  way 
that  Chillicothe  is  not  any  easier  to 
beat  in  basketball  than  they  are  in 
football. 

The  Spoofhounds  traveled  to 
Chillicothe  Friday,  and  the  Hornets 
stung  the  ’Hounds  in  a  51-42  loss. 

The  ’Hounds  led  by  three  points 
at  the  half  but  could  not  keep  up  the 
pace  with  Hornets  in  the  second  half. 

“It  came  down  to  two  or  three 


plays  at  the  end  of  the  game,” 
Kuwitzky  said.  “At  the  end,  we 
made  some  bad  decisions,  and  that 
madc-the  difference.” 

Junior  Grant  Sutton  led  the 
Spoofhounds  in  their  effort,  picking 
apart  the  Hornet  defense  for  13 
points. 

The  ’Hounds  will  play  host  to 
Falls  City  at  7:30  p.m.  Friday.  The 
’Hounds’  next  game  will  be  Tues¬ 
day  when  they  battle  the  Lafayette 
Fighting  Irish  in  Maryville.

Girls’  basketball  team 
preps  for  home  game 
against  East  Buchanan . 

by  Jacob  DIPietre _ 

Chief  Reporter 

The  ’Hounds’  last  basketball  game 
could  easily  be  compared  to  David  and 
Goliath,  except  this  time  David  did  not 
win. 

The  Chilicothe  Hornets,  now  12- 
2, .are  ranked  fourth  in  the  state  and 
are  undefeated  in  the  Midland  Empire 
Conference. 

Compare  that  to  a  relatively  inex¬ 
perienced  team  who  is  in  the  midst  of 
a  rebuilding  year,  and  one  would  think 
Maryville  did  not  stand  a  chance. 
However,  the  ’Hounds  did  not  give  up 
without  a  fight. 

“I  was  real  pleased  with  how  we 
played,”  ’Hounds’  coach  Jeff  Martin 
said.  “We  had  opportunity  at  the  end 
of  the  ballgame  to  win  the  game,  we 
just  ran  out  of  time.” 

The  ’  Hounds,  who  shot  just  29  per¬ 
cent  from  the  field,  cut  the  Hornet  lead 
to  five  with  about  three  minutes  left 
but  were  unable  to  close  out  the  game, 
losing  46-35. 

’Hounds’  center  Charity  Smail, 
who  had  been  averaging  over  20 
points  per  game  in  her  last  five  games, 
was  shut  down  to  only  12  by  the  Hor¬ 
nets’  defense. 

“Every  time  Charity  got  the  ball 
down  in  the  low  post  they  would  have 


two  or  three  people  just  suck  in  on 
her,”  Martin  said.  “They  made  it 
tough  for  her.  They  did  a  good  job  on 
her.”' 

Martin  said  he  was  very  proud  of 
his  team’s  effort  and  thinks  defense 
was  one  of  the  keys  to  its  success  so 
far  in  the  season. 

“We  played  our  best  defensive 
game  of  the  year  down  there,”  Mar¬ 
tin  said.  “Chillicothe  made  27  turn¬ 
overs  that  night.” 

The  ’Hounds,  I  -3  in  the  MEC  and 
9-9  overall,  now  turn  their  attention 
to  the  streaking  East  Buchanan  Bull¬ 
dogs.  The  Bulldogs  have  won  their 
last  seven  games  and  Martin  said  the 
game  should  be  a  close  one. 

“It  is  going  to  be  a  good  game; 
they’ve  got  some  good  players,”  Mar¬ 
tin  said.  “They  have  improved  a  lot, 
but  it  is  a  team  we  can  beat  if  we  play 
well.” 

While  the  team  is  focusing  on  one 
game  at  a  time,  Martin  is  still  look¬ 
ing  forward  to  districts  which  begin 
Feb.  24. 

Maryville  has  seven  opponents  on 
its  schedule  this  season,  and  Martin 
said  his  team  can  be  successful  in  dis¬ 
tricts  if  it  puts  together  a  good  string 
of  games. 

"We  feel  like  whoever  wins  the 
district  is  going  to  be  the  team  that 
puts  together  the  best  stretch  of  bas¬ 
ketball  during  the  week  of  districts,” 
Martin  said.  “We  could  be  one  of 
those  teams  if  we  make  the  effort  in 
all  these  ballgames  and  play  good 
defense  in  all  these  ballgames.”

according  to 
Wins  the  American 

_ Gelnosky  Heritage 

College 

Dictionary,  but  most  people  have 
their  own  definition  of  the  word  that 
doesn’t  resemble  this  one. 

Professional  athletes  and  profes¬ 
sional  sports  have  taken  a  bad  rap 
over  the  last  decade  or  so,  but  the 
problem  has  worsened  over  the  past 
year. 

The  Dallas  Cowboys  have  been 
the  main  culprit  with  the  suspensions 
of  players  because  of  drug  use  and 
run-ins  with  the  law  —  Eric  Will¬ 
iams,  Michael  Irvin  and  Leon  Lett 
just  to  name  a  few. 

The  most  recent  incident  was  in 
Minnesota  when  the  Chicago  Bulls’ 
Dennis  Rodman  kicked  a  camera 
man  on  the  baseline,  and  he  was 
suspended  and  fined  by  the  National 
Basketball  Association. 

Society  has  reached  the  point 
where  it  sees  these  hthletes  as  having 
bad  moral  judgement  and  as  being 
those  who  only  look  out  for  them¬ 
selves. 

Stereotypes  have  been  created  for 
athletes  no  matter  what  sport  they 
play,  what  sex  they  are  and  how' 
much  money  they  make. 

That’s  when  one  athlete  made-the 
headlines  last  week  and  stepped 
apart  from  all  other  “athletes.” 

Carlos  Rogers,  a  center  for  the 
Toronto  Raptors,  made  the  news 
across  the  country  last  week.  It 
wasn’t  because  he  was  arrested,  and 
he  didn’t  beat  up  a  fan  at  a  game 
either. 

Rogers’  29-year-old  sister,  Rene, 
was  admitted  to  the  Henry  Ford 
Hospital  in  Detroit,  Mich.,  awaiting  a 
kidney  transplant. 

After  an  unsuccessful  operation, 

Carlos  was  told  by  doctors  that  his 
sister  may  not  live  unless  he  donated 
one  of  his  kidneys. 

In  most  cases,  a  kidney  donor  is 
not  in  any  big  danger  because  a 
person  can  live  with  only  one  kidney, 
but  because  Carlos  is  a  professional 
athlete,  the  loss  of  a  kidney  would 
l*  cost  him  his  NBA  career.  “  ' 

At  age  26  and  only  his  third  year 
in  the  professional  ranks,  Carlos 
looked  to  have  a  bright  future  with 
an  expansion  team. 

When  Rene  went  into  critical 
condition  last  week;  Carlos  flew 
back  to  his  hometown  of  Detroit  to 
prepare  to  help  his  sister. 

Carlos  said  it  was  a  “no  brain 
decision”  whether  to  give  up  his 
career  or  not.  He  said  his  sister  was 
his  biggest  fan,  and  now  it  was  his 
turn  to  be  hers. 

Even  though  Rene  did  not  survive 
her  condition  and  Carlos  did  not 
have  the  opportunity  to  help  his 
sister,  it  is  still  a  great  story  of  love 
between  a  brother  and  sister. 

So  you  still  think  you  know  the 
definition  of  an  athlete? 

Well,  Carlos  Rogers  rewrote 
many  people’s  definition  in  the 
dictionary,  and  now  it’s  easy  to  see 
how  stereotypes  are  nothing  more 
than  just  that.

an  administrator  in  a  major  hospital  and  just 
under  a  year  ago  she  couldn’t  wait  to  get  out 
of  the  hospital. 

i  As  one  of  four  survivors  of  an  American 
I  Airlines  crash  Dec.  20,  1995,  Ramirez  suf- 
I  fered  serious  injuries  to  her  abdomen,  and 
9  also  had  a  broken  thigh  and  a  broken  spine 
'  that  kept  her  in  a  hospital  in  Cali,  Columbia, 
for  10  days  and  at  Truman  Medical  Center 
in  Kansas  City,  Mo.,  for  five  weeks. 

Continuing  her  journey  to  give  to  others, 
Ramirez  is  hoping  to  work  for  the  insurance 
company,  where  she  has  interned  since  she 
was  in  high  school,  when  she  graduates  in 
January. 

“I  like  dealing  with  health  care  especially 
since  I  was  in  the  hospital  for  so  long,” 
Ramirez  said.  “Since  my  major  is  for  busi¬ 
ness,  I  can  see  the  aspect  of  paying  and  such, 
but  then  I  also  see  how  the  patient  feels  and 
how  they  are  treated.” 

Ramirez’s  extended  stay  last  January  was 
for  her  recovery  after  the  jetliner  crashed  in 
the  Colombian  mountains  on  her  21st  birth¬ 
day.  The  160  casualties  on  the  flight  included 
her  parents  Benjamin  and  Mercedes 
Ramirez.  They  were  on  their  way  to  spend 
Christmas  with  family  in  Colombia. 

“The  entire  experience  has  forced  me  to 
be  stronger  because  if  not,  I  would  not  have 
been  able  to  handle  going  through  this  situ¬ 
ation,  either  that  or  go  crazy,”  she  said.  “It’s 
up  to  me  to  overcome  my  obstacles  because 
I  can’t  really  depend  on  anybody  and  I  use  a 
lot  of  self  motivation.” 

Giving  to  Northwest  has  also  inspired 
Ramirez  in  many  ways.  Although  she  stays 
busy  with  a  full  load  of  classes,  Ramirez  also 
finds  time  to  give  tours  as  a  student  ambas¬ 
sador,  spend  time  with  her  Phi  Mu  sisters 
and  works  at  the  library  for  her  Presidential/ 
Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  scholarship. 

“This  semester  will  be  busy  but  fun  be¬ 
cause  instead  of  just  doing  the  regular  library 
job,  English  teachers  will  bring  their  students 
on  certain  days  to  learn  to  use  the  comput¬ 
ers,”  Ramirez  said.  “I  will  be  able  to  help 
out  with  that,  and  I  just  love  to  work  with 
people.” 

Her  ability  to  work  with  people  has  made 
her  time  at  Northwest  not  only  a  positive  ex¬ 
perience  but  her  second  family  as  well. 

“My  sister  went  to  the  University  of  Kan¬ 
sas  and  it  was  just  too  big,”  she  said.  “I  know 
she  felt  like  just  a  number  because  she  ended 
up  transferring  to  a  smaller  school  after  her 
first  year.  I  can’t  imagine  myself  at  any  other 
school  and  everybody  has  just  been  so  sup¬ 
portive  since  my  accident.  Teachers  who 
weren’t  even  my  teachers  sent  me  cards  and 
you  could  just  tell  that  people  were  con¬ 
cerned  about  me.  I  can’t  imagine  that  if  I  had 
gone  to  a  big  state  school  most  of  the  people 
probably  wouldn’t  even  known  my  name.” 

Coming  back  to  school  was  a  major  mo¬ 
tivation  for  her  steps  to  recovery. 

“For  a  while  I  used  a  cane  to  walk,  and 
some  of  my  friends  said  to  just  come  to 
Maryville  and  everyone  knew  why  I  had  it, 
but  I  was  kind  of  embarrassed  to  come  back 
like  that,”  she  said.  “So  it  was  a  motivation 
for  me  to  come  back  and  see  my  friends  as 
well  as  coming  to  as  much  of  a  normal  state 
as  possible.” 

Normal  is  something  Ramirez  strives  and 
continues  to  works  for. 

“My  leg  still  doesn’t  bend,”  she  said.  “I 
can  walk  for  exercise  and  do  a  lot  of  things 
that  I  used  to,  which  includes  the  Nordic 
Track,  and  I  used  to  work  with  my  physical 
therapy  in  the  athletic  department.” 

Her  physical  recovery  has  improved,  but 
the  emotional  healing  has  taken  time,  too. 
Ramirez  relies  on  her  sister  Sylvia  and 
Nicholas,  Sylvia’s  son,  who  live  in  Girard, 
Kan.,  as  well  as  her  friends  and  God. 

“I’ve  had  a  lot  of  support  from  my  sister 
and  friends,  and  we  just  talk  about  what’s 
wrong  and  things  like  that,”  she  said.  “It’s 
nice  to  see  that  people  are  willing  to  be  there 
to  listen.  I  try  not  to  talk  about  it  because  I 
think  about  the  person  listening  on  the  other 
side." 

Even  though  she  doesn’t  like  to  burden 
others,  Ramirez  always  makes  time  for  a 
friend. 

“There  are  only  a  select  few  that  I  do  talk 
to  about  it  and  I  know  they  will  always  be 
there  for  me,"  Ramirez  said.  “If  somebody 
goes  through  something  like  that  hopefully 


they  could  count  on  me,  too.  I  could  sympa¬ 
thize  with  them  because  I’ve  been  in  their 
shoes.” 

Although  she  has  had  an  enormous 
amount  of  support  from  her  family  and 
friends  throughout  the  past  year,  Ramirez 
now  finds  herself  a  more  independent  indi¬ 
vidual. 

“I  have  to  do  everything  on  my  own  now: 
Either  I  do  it  or  nothing  gets  done,”  she  said, 
“It  has  made  me  a  stronger  person  because 
now  I  don’t  have  good  old  mom  and  dad  to 
depend  on  to  do  something  for  me.” 

The  one-year  anniversary  of  the  plane 
crash  was  difficult  for  Ramirez,  but  she 
worked,  kept  busy  and  spent  the  holidays 
with  her  sister  and  boyfriend. 

She  attended  a  mass  in  her  parents’ 
memories  on  Dec.  21  at  St.  Patrick’s  Catho¬ 
lic  Church  in  Kansas  City.  The  phone  calls 
never  stopped  from  family  and  her  parents’ 
friends  on  the  tragic  anniversary. 

“It  was  hard,  but  I  am  just  trying  to  do 
what  I  know  my  my  parents  wanted  me  to 
do  because  I  can’t  put  my  life  on  hold,” 
Ramirez  said.  “They  were  positive  people, 
and  they  wouldn’t  want  me  to  sit  around  and 
feel  sonry  for  myself.” 

Ramirez’s  plans  are  to  graduate  in  Decem¬ 
ber  of  this  year  and  do  what  most  college 
graduates  do  —  find  a  job. 

“I  felt  so  much  support  from  my  teachers 
after  not  being  here  for  a  semester,”  she  said. 
"Especially  since  I  came  back  in  the  sum¬ 
mertime  it  was  an  adjustment  period  of  not 
being  in  school  to  having  a  full  load  again.  It 
was  nice  to  come  back  and  take  two  classes 
and  try  to  get  back  in  the  swing  of  things.” 

Things  are  going  smoothly  for  Ramirez, 
which  she  credits  to  the  support  of  her  friends 
at  Northwest. 

“It  was  just  so  nice  to  see  that  people  cared 
and  still  care,"  Ramirez  said.  “Every  now  and 
then  I  get  little  cards  to  tell  me  they  are  think¬ 
ing  of  me,  which  is  really  nice  and  it  helps.” 

The  extra  media  attention  for  her  birth¬ 
day  this  year  didn’t  help  when  all  the  sta- 


Gene  Cassell/  Photography  Director 

tions  called,  but  she  only  did  one  interview. 

“When  the  interview  was  done,  the  lady 
asked  me  if  I  was  going  to  hit  all  the  stations 
and  I  said  no  it’s  my  birthday,  I  want  to  carry 
on  as  normal,”  Ramirez  said.  “I  still  get 
.phone  calls  to  do  this  and  do  that,  but  I  am 
jUSt.trying  stay  away  from  all  of  that.”  ... 

Although  this  last  year  has  been  quite 
eventful  for  Ramiref,  iter  memories  of  her 
parents  continue  to  live  in  her  heart. 

“One  of  my  proudest  moments  was  when 
I  won  a  scholarship  in  high  school  —  it  was 
kind  of  like  they  had  the  debutantes  and  a 
competition  for  the  scholarship,"  she  said. 
“We  had  to  do  a  dance  with  our  fathers,  and 
so  we  had  to  practice  for  weeks.  Every  Sat¬ 
urday  we  had  to  go  with  our  dads  and  prac¬ 
tice  the  waltz  and  where  and  how  to  stand.  I 
won  first  place,  and  I  knew  that  my  parents 
were  really  excited. 

“It  was  something  I  worked  for,  not  like 
the  Royals  game,  which  was  a  big  deal  and  I 
was  honored,  but.I  really  didn’t  do  anything 
to  deserve  it  —  something  just  happened.” 

Ramirez  loves  to  spend  her  very  little  free 
time  to  relax,  listen  to  any  type  of  music  and 
write  to  her  family. 

"Everyone  has  kind  of  taken  me  under 
their  wings,  so  I  always  get  cards  and  letters 
from  aunts  and  cousins  from  everywhere  in 
Colombia  and  Nicaragua,”  she  said. 

A  memorial  park  was  made  in  Colombia 
in  honor  of  all  the  people  who  passed  away 
in  the  crash.  Ramirez  plans  to  visit  soon. 

“I  have  never  seen  my  parents’  grave,  but 
I  know  the  cemetery  because  most  of  my 
family  is  buried  there,”  she  said.  “I  have 
flown  a  couple  of  times  and  I  get  nervous, 
but  I  am  not  totally  relaxed  until  after  the 
take  off  and  the  landings.  But  I  do  plan  to 
visit  Colombia  soon." 

This  past  year  has  been  quite  eventful,  yet 
it  still  leaves  Ramirez  with  many  unanswered  ’ 
questions. 

"Out  of  all  the  people  in  that  flight  I  won¬ 
der  why  God  picked  me,”  Ramirez  said.  “I 
still  don’t  know  why.”

Your  Man  takes  in  the  big  game 


The  Stroller 

Yours  Truly 
gives 
awards  for 
the  best 
Super  Bowl 
commercials 
of  1997 


Special  note:  Dear  Pub  owners,  is  there 
anyway  Your  Man  can  get  a  special  kick  back 
for  the  number  of  times  your  fine,  fine 
establishment  was  mentioned  in  last  week’s 
adventure?  Just  curious. 

The  first  week  of  classes  has  come  and 
gone  and  yes,  I  did  manage  to  make  it  to  most 
of  them.  Surprise.  But  even  with  the  begin¬ 
ning  of  the  semester  here  Your  Man  still  had  . 
his  eyes  set  on  something  else  —  the  Super 
Bowl.  Or  just  another  excuse  for  students  and 
me  to  drink  like  it  was  a  Friday  night.  (By  the 
way  I  did  make  it  to  the  Pub,  but  no  more  free 
advertisements  until  I  get  reimbursed  with 
beer  by  the  management.) 

The  Super  Bowl  is  a  great  time,  and  Your 
Man  has  really  reaped  the  benefits  of  living 
off  campus.  You  all  know  how  this  is  an 
alcohol-free  living  environment,  right  kids? 

Living  off  campus  the  past  six  years  has 
really  opened  doors  of  opportunities.  Girls  in 
my  hole-in-the-wall  apartment  at  all  hours  of 
the  day,  the  maid  that  picks  up  after  me  and 
my  messy  roomie  Fred;  and  the  two  car 
garage  that  houses  my  brand  new  Chevy 
Camera.  Oh  hell,  all  of  that  information  is  for 
the  fantasy  column,  I’ll  have  to  use  all  that 
later  in  the  semester. 

Anyway,  back  to  reality. 

It  is  hard  to  watch  a  Super  Bowl  game  on  a 
14-inch  black  and  white  television  set,  much  , 
less  anything  else.  I  do  get  Showtime  free 
though.  Your  Man  just  has  to  watch  between 
the  lines  of  static.  But  it’s  worth  it. 

However,  as  pathetic  as  Your  Man’s  life 
has  been  since  the  day  I  left  the  birth  canal, 
there  are  some  much  less  fortunate  than  me. 

My  friends  Dean  and  Bob  actually  wanted  to 
come  over  and  watch  the  Super  Bowl  at  my 
one-bedroom  shack. 

There  was  an  advantage  to  the  bobsy-idiots 
coming  over.  They  had  fake  IDs  which  were 
used  to  buy  beer  for  the  afternoon,  and  I 
wasn’t  going  to  complain  since  Your  Man 
hasn’t  had  money  since  I  left  Colden  Hall  last 
week.  I  had  been  at  (insert  favorite  drinking 
place  here). 

So  they  arrived  with  the  start  of  the  first 
pregame  show  at  noon  and  we  drank  and 
drank  and  ate  and  ate.  It  was  truly  a  paradise, 
almost  as  much  fun  as  a  hillbilly  at  a  family 
reunion.  I  really  don’t  remember  much  of  the 
pregame  show  except  for  Terry  Bradshaw’s 
shining  head.  (That’s  not  a  bald  crack,  it’s 


really  not.) 

But  as  the  game  was  ready  to  start,  I  came 
to  and  sat  back  to  watch  a  NFC  butt-kicking. 
The  last  time  the  NFC  lost  a  Super  Bowl  was 
when  ZZ  Top  was  actually  cool.  Ironic  they 
were  one  of  the  halftime  performers,  wasn’t 
it? 

With  the  game  basically  being  over  by 
halftime,  the  commercials  seemed  to  take  on  a 
rather  entertaining  value  to  an  otherwise 
boring  game.  It  was  really  bad  since  Your  Man 
had  run  out  of  drinkage. 

So  with  that  in  mind,  Your  Man  would  like 
to  give  the  “Your  Man  Ad"  of  the  Super  Bowl 
to  the  chicken  crossing  the  road  Budweiser 
commercial.  I  guess  it  was  a  good  thing  those 
burping  frogs  weren’t  anywhere  near  New 
Orleans  or  they  could  have  become  an 
appetizer. 

A  close  second-place  award  goes  to  the 
bomber  birds  for  Nissan.  Do  birds  only  come 
out  like  that  after  a  car  is  washed? 

The  third-place  award  goes  to  the  new 
Budweiser  caveman  series. 

A  special  honorable  mention  goes  to  the 
Pepsi  commercial  early  in  the  afternoon  with 
the  baby  and  the  three  super  models.  That 
would  be  a  pleasant  first  memory  to  have,  but 
unfortunately  for  Your  Man,  the  first  thing  I 
remember  is  getting  slapped.  It’s  kind  of  like 
when  I  ask  someone  out  for  a  date. 

But  as  the  game  drew  to  a  close,  Your  Man 
thought  back  to  how  the  Patriots  must  have 
felt  being  the  underdogs  and  then  leading  for 
part  of  the  game,  then  watching  it  slip  away. 

I  remembered,  that  has  been  the  story  of 
my  life.  I  am  not  a  loser,  I  have  just  been 
blessed  with  a  substantial  amount  of  bad  luck. 

Kind  of  like  another  bar  in  town.  How  was 
business  with  the  liquor  inspector  and 
undercover  cops  roaming  around?  Speaking  of 
which,  what  qualifications  does  it  take  to  be  a 
liquor  inspector?  This  sounds  like  a  job  even 
Your  Man  could  do  without  much  of  a 
problem  at  all. 

Well,  America’s  Dumbest  Criminals  are 
coming  on  and  Your  Man  likes  to  look  for 
relatives.  Until  next  week,  keep  your  feet  on 
the  ground  unless  you  are  running  from  a 
greenman  in  a  sidewalk  sweeper  cleaning  the 
snow  off  of  the  ice  below. 

The  Stroller  has  been  a  tradition  at  Northwest  since 
1918.
