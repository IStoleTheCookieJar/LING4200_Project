EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY 


The  1990  Clean  Air  Act  Amendments  contain  a  list  of  188  hazardous  air 
pollutants  (HAPs)  which  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  must  study,  identify 
sources  of,  and  determine  if  regulations  are  warranted.  One  of  these  HAPs,  benzene,  is  the 
subject  of  this  document.  This  document  describes  the  properties  of  benzene  as  an  air 
pollutant,  defmes  its  production  and  use  patterns,  identifies  source  categories  of  air  emissions, 
and  provides  benzene  emission  factors.  The  document  is  a  part  of  an  ongoing  EPA  series 
designed  to  assist  the  general  public  at  large,  but  primarily  State/local  air  agencies,  in 
identifying  sources  of  HAPs  and  developing  emissions  estimates. 

Benzene  is  primarily  used  in  the  manufacture  of  other  organic  chemicals, 
including  ethylbenzene/styrene,  cumene/phenol,  cyclohexane,  and  nitrobenzene/aniline. 
Benzene  is  emitted  into  the  atmosphere  from  its  production,  its  use  as  a  chemical  feedstock  in 
the  production  of  other  chemicals,  the  use  of  those  other  chemicals,  and  from  fossil  fuel  and 
biomass  combustion.  Benzene  is  also  emitted  from  a  wide  variety  of  miscellaneous  sources 
including  oil  and  gas  wellheads,  glycol  dehydrators,  petroleum  refining,  gasoline  marketing, 
wastewater  treatment,  landfills,  pulp  and  paper  mills,  and  from  mobile  sources. 

In  addition  to  identifying  sources  of  benzene  emissions,  information  is  provided 
that  specifies  how’  individual  sources  of  benzene  may  be  tested  to  quantify-  air  emissions.

SECTION  1.0 

PURPOSE  OF  DOCUMENT 


The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  State,  and  local  air  pollution 
control  agencies  are  becoming  increasingly  aware  of  the  presence  of  substances  in  the  ambient 
air  that  may  be  toxic  at  certain  concentrations.  This  awareness,  in  turn,  has  led  to  attempts  to 
identify  source/receptor  relationships  for  these  substances  and  to  develop  control  programs  to 
regulate  emissions.  Unfortunately,  limited  information  is  available  on  the  ambient  air 
concentrations  of  these  substances  or  about  the  sources  that  may  be  discharging  them  to  the 
atmosphere. 


To  assist  groups  interested  in  inventorying  air  emissions  of  various  potentially 
toxic  substances,  EPA  is  preparing  a  series  of  locating  and  estimating  (L&E)  documents  such 
as  this  one  that  compiles  available  information  on  sources  and  emissions  of  these  substances. 
Other  documents  in  the  series  are  listed  below:

This  document  deals  specifically  with  benzene.  Its  intended  audience  includes 
Federal,  State,  and  local  air  pollution  personnel  and  others  who  are  interested  in  locating 
potential  emitters  of  benzene  and  estimating  their  air  emissions.

Because  of  the  limited  availability  of  data  on  potential  sources  of  benzene 
emissions  and  the  variability  in  process  configurations,  control  equipment,  and  operating 
procedure  among  facilities,  this  document  is  best  used  as  a  primer  on  (1)  types  of  sources  that 
may  emit  benzene,  (2)  process  variations  and  release  points  that  may  be  expected,  and 
(3)  available  emissions  information  on  the  potential  for  benzene  releases  into  the  air.  The 
reader  is  cautioned  against  using  the  emissions  information  in  this  document  to  develop  an 
'  exact  assessment  of  emissions  from  any  particular  facility. 

Emission  estimates  may  need  to  be  adjusted  to  take  into  consideration 
participation  in  EPA’s  voluntary  emission  reduction  program  or  compliance  with  State  or  local 
regulations. 

It  is  possible,  in  some  cases,  that  orders-of-magnitude  differences  may  result 
between  actual  and  estimated  emissions,  depending  on  differences  in  source  configurations, 
control  equipment,  and  operating  practices.  Thus,  in  all  situations  where  an  accurate 
assessment  of  benzene  emissions  is  necessary,  the  source-specific  information  should  be 
obtained  to  confirm  the  existence  of  particular  emitting  operations  and  the  types  and 
effectiveness  of  control  measures,  and  to  determine  the  impact  of  operating  practices.  A 
source  test  and/or  material  balance  calculation  should  be  considered  as  better  methods  of 
determining  air  emissions  from  a  specific  operation. 

In  addition  to  the  information  presented  in  this  document,  another  potential 
source  of  emissions  data  for  benzene  from  facilities  is  the  Toxic  Chemical  Release  Inventory 
(TRI)  form  required  by  Title  III,  Section  313  of  the  1986  Superfund  Amendments  and 
Reauthorization  Act  (SARA).1  Section  313  requires  owners  and  operators  of  facilities  in 
certain  Standard  Industrial  Classification  Codes  that  manufacture,  import,  process,  or 
otherwise  use  toxic  chemicals  (as  listed  in  Section  313)  to  report  annually  their  releases  of 
these  chemicals  to  all  environmental  media.  As  part  of  SARA  313,  EPA  provides  public 
access  to  the  annual  emissions  data. 


1-3 


The  TRI  data  include  general  facility  information,  chemical  information,  and 
emissions  data.  Air  emissions  data  are  reported  as  total  facility  release  estimates  for  fugitive 
emissions  and  point  source  emissions.  No  individual  process  or  stack  data  are  provided  to 
EPA  under  the  program.  SARA  Section  313  requires  sources  to  use  available  stack  monitoring 
data  for  reporting  but  does  not  require  facilities  to  perform  stack  monitoring  or  other  types  of 
emissions  measurement.  If  monitoring  data  are  unavailable,  emissions  are  to  be  quantified 
'  based  on  best  estimates  of  releases  to  the  environment. 

The  reader  is  cautioned  that  TRI  will  not  likely  provide  facility,  emissions,  and 
chemical  release  data  sufficient  for  conducting  detailed  exposure  modeling  and  risk  assessment. 
In  many  cases,  the  TRI  data  are  based  on  annual  estimates  of  emissions  (i.e.,  on  emission 
factors,  material  balance  calculations,  and  engineering  judgment).  The  EPA  recommends  use 
of  TRI  data  in  conjunction  with  the  information  provided  in  this  document  to  locate  potential 
emitters  of  benzene  and  to  make  preliminary  estimates  of  air  emissions  from  these  facilities. 

For  mobile  sources,  more  data  are  becoming  available  for  on-road  vehicles. 
Additionally,  the  EPA  model  that  generates  emission  factors  undergoes  regular  update.  The 
on-road  mobile  sources  section  in  this  document  should  therefore  be  viewed  as  an  example  of 
how  emissions  can  be  determined  and  the  reader  should  look  for  more  detailed  data  for  the 
most  accurate  estimates. 

Data  on  off-road  vehicles  and  other  stationary  sources  remain  unavailable. 
However,  with  EPA’s  increased  emphasis  on  air  toxics,  more  benzene  data  are  likely  to  be 
generated  in  the  future. 

As  standard  procedure,  L&E  documents  are  sent  to  government,  industry,  and 
environmental  groups  wherever  EPA  is  aware  of  expertise.  These  groups  are  given  the 
opportunity  to  review  a  document,  comment,  and  provide  additional  data  where  applicable. 
Where  necessary,  the  document  is  then  revised  to  incorporate  these  comments.  Although  this 
document  has  undergone  extensive  review,  there  may  still  be  shortcomings.  Comments

resources.  In  addition,  any  information  on  process  descriptions,  operating  parameters,  control 
measures,  and  emissions  information  that  would  enable  EPA  to  improve  on  the  contents  of  this 
document  is  welcome.  All  comments  should  be  sent  to:

SECTION  2.0 

OVERVIEW  OF  DOCUMENT  CONTENTS 


This  section  briefly  outlines  the  nature,  extent,  and  format  of  the  material 
presented  in  the  remaining  sections  of  this  report. 

Section  3.0  provides  a  brief  summary  of  the  physical  and  chemical 
characteristics  of  benzene  and  an  overview  of  its  production,  uses,  and  emissions  sources. 

This  background  section  may  be  useful  to  someone  who  needs  to  develop  a  general  perspective 
on  the  nature  of  benzene,  how  it  is  manufactured  and  consumed,  and  sources  of  emissions. 

Section  4.0  focuses  on  the  production  of  benzene  and  the  associated  air 
emissions.  For  each  major  production  source  category  described  in  Section  4.0,  an  example 
process  description  and  a  flow  diagram(s)  with  potential  emission  points  are  given.  Available 
emissions  estimates  are  used  to  calculate  emission  factors  that  show  the  potential  for  benzene 
emissions  before  and  after  controls  employed  by  industry.  Also  provided  are  estimates  of 
emissions  from  process  vents,  equipment  leaks,  storage  tanks,  and  wastewater.  Individual 
companies  that  are  reported  in  trade  publications  to  produce  benzene  are  named. 

Section  5.0  describes  major  source  categories  that  use  benzene  as  a  feedstock  to 
produce  industrial  organic  chemicals.  For  each  major  production  process,  a  description(s)  of 
the  process  is  given  along  with  a  process  flow  diagram(s).  Potential  emission  points  are 
identified  on  the  diagrams  and  emission  ranges  are  presented,  where  available.  Individual 
companies  that  use  benzene  as  a  feedstock  are  reported. 


2-1 


Section  6.0  describes  emission  sources  where  benzene  is  emitted  as  the 


by-product  of  a  process  (such  as  petroleum  refineries)  and  post-manufacturing  activities  where 
releases  from  benzene-containing  products  may  occur  (such  as  from  gasoline  distribution) . 
Example  process  descriptions  and  flow  diagrams  are  provided  in  addition  to  available  emission 
factors  for  each  major  industrial  category  described  in  this  section. 

Section  7.0  presents  information  on  stationary  combustion  sources  (such  as 
municipal  waste  combustors)  and  area  combustion  sources  (such  as  open  burning).  Example 
incinerator,  furnace,  or  boiler  diagrams  are  given,  when  appropriate.  Emission  factors  are 
also  given,  when  available. 

Section  8.0  provides  a  brief  summary  on  benzene  emissions  from  mobile 
sources.  This  section  addresses  both  on-road  and  off-road  sources.  Section  9.0  summarizes 
available  procedures  for  source  sampling  and  analysis  of  benzene.  This  section  provides  an 
overview  of  applicable  sampling  procedures  and  cites  references  for  those  interested  in 
conducting  source  tests.  Section  10.0  presents  a  list  of  all  the  references  Cited  in  this 
document. 


Appendix  A  presents  a  summary  table  of  the  emission  factors  contained  in  this 
document.  This  table  also  presents  the  factor  quality  rating  and  the  Source  Classification  Code 
(SCC)  or  Area/Mobile  Source  (AMS)  code  associated  with  each  emission  factor.  Appendix  B 

presents  a  list  of  all  the  petroleum  refmeries  in  the  United  States. 

Each  emission  factor  listed  in  Sections  4.0  through  8.0  was  assigned  an  emission 
factor  rating  (A,  B,  C,  D,  E,  or  U),  based  on  the  criteria  for  assigning  data  quality  ratings  and 
emission  factor  ratings  as  discussed  in  the  document  Procedures  for  Preparing  Emission  Factor 
Documents}  The  criteria  for  assigning  the  data  quality  ratings  are  as  follows: 


A  -  Tests  are  performed  by  using  an  EPA  reference  test  method,  or  when  not 

applicable,  a  sound  methodology.  Tests  are  reported  in  enough  detail  for 


.2-2 


adequate  validation,  and,  raw  data  are  provided  that  can  be  used  to 
duplicate  the  emission  results  presented  in  the  report. 

B  -  Tests  are  performed  by  a  generally  sound  methodology,  but  lacking 

enough  detail  for  adequate  validation.  Data  are  insufficient  to  completely 
duplicate  the  emission  result  presented  in  the  report. 

C  -  Tests  are  based  on  an  unproven  or  new  methodology,  or  are  lacking  a 
significant  amount  of  background  information. 

D  -  Tests  are  based  on  generally  unacceptable  method,  but  the  method  may 
provide  an  order-of-magnitude  value  for  the  source. 


Once  the  data  quality  ratings  for  the  source  tests  had  been  assigned,  these 
ratings  along  with  the  number  of  source  tests  available  for  a  given  emission  point  were 
evaluated.  Because  of  the  almost  impossible  task  of  assigning  a  meaningful  confidence  limit  to 
industry-specific  variables  (e.g.,  sample  size  vs.  sample  population,  industry  and  facility 
variability,  method  of  measurement),  the  use  of  a  statistical  confidence  interval  for  establishing 
a  representative  emission  factor  for  each  source  category  was  not  practical.  Therefore,  some 
subjective  quality  rating  was  necessary.  The  following  emission  factor  quality  ratings  were 
used  in  the  emission  factor  tables  in  this  document: 


A  -  Excellent.  Emission  factor  is  developed  primarily  from  A-  and  B-rated 

source  test  data  taken  from  many  randomly  chosen  facilities  in  the  industry 
population.  The  source  category  population  is  sufficiently  specific  to 
minimize  variability. 

E  Above  average.  Emission  factor  is  developed  primarily  from  A-  or 

B-rated  test  data  from  a  moderate  number  of  facilities.  Although  no 
specific  bias  is  evident,  it  is  not  clear  if  the  facilities  tested  represent  a 
random  sample  of  the  industry.  As  with  the  A  rating,  the  source  category 
population  is  sufficiently  specific  to  minimize  variability. 

C  -  Average.  Emission  factor  is  developed  primarily  from  A-,  B-,  and  C-rated 
test  data  from  a  reasonable  number  of  facilities.  Although  no  specific  bias 
is  evident,  it  is  not  clear  if  the  facilities  tested  represent  a  random  sample 
of  the  industry.  As  with  the  A  rating,  the  source  category  population  is 
sufficiently  specific  to  minimize  variability. 


2-3 


D  -  Below  average.  Emission  factor  is  developed  primarily  form  A-,  B-,  and 
C-rated  test  data  from  a  small  number  of  facilities,  and  there  may  be 
reason  to  suspect  that  these  facilities  do  not  represent  a  random  sample  of 
the  industry.  There  also  may  be  evidence  of  variability  within  the  source 
population. 

E  -  Poor.  Factor  is  developed  from  C-  rated  and  D-rated  test  data  from  a  very 
few  number  of  facilities,  and  there  may  be  reasons  to  suspect  that  the 
facilities  tested  do  not  represent  a  random  sample  of  the  industry.  There 
also  may  be  evidence  of  variability  within  the  source  category  population. 

U  -  Unrated  (Only  used  in  the  L&E  documents).  Emission  factor  is  developed 
from  source  tests  which  have  not  been  thoroughly  evaluated,  research 
papers,  modeling  data,  or  other  sources  that  may  lack  supporting 
documentation.  The  data  are  not  necessarily  “poor,”  but  there  is  not 
enough  information  to  rate  the  factors  according  to  the  rating  protocol. 

This  document  does  not  contain  any  discussion  of  health  or  other  environmental 
effects  of  benzene,  nor  does  it  include  any  discussion  of  ambient  air  levels.

BACKGROUND  INFORMATION 


3 . 1  NATURE  OF  POLLUTANT 

Benzene  is  a  clear,  colorless,  aromatic  hydrocarbon  that  has  a  characteristic 
sickly  sweet  odor.  It  is  both  volatile  and  flammable.  Chemical  identification  information  for 
benzene  is  found  in  Table-3- 1.  Selected  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  benzene  are 
presented  in  Table  3-2  A7 

Benzene  contains  92.3  percent  carbon  and  7.7  percent  hydrogen  (by  mass).  The 
benzene  molecule  is  represented  by  a  hexagon  formed  by  six  sets  of  carbon  and  hydrogen 
atoms  bonded  together  with  alternating  single  and  double  bonds.

The  chemical  behavior  of  benzene  indicates  that  the  benzene  molecule  is  more  realistically 
represented  as  a  resonance-stabilized  structure: 


in  which  the  carbon-to-carbon  bonds  are  identical.  The  benzene  molecule  is  the  cornerstone 
tor  aromatic  compounds,  all  of  which  contain  one  or  more  benzene  rings.6 

Because  of  its  resonance  properties,  benzene  is  highly  stable  for  an  unsaturated 
hydrocarbon.  However,  it  does  react  with  other  compounds,  primarily  by  substitution  and,  to 
a  lesser  degree,  by  addition.  Some  reactions  can  rupture  the  molecule  or  result  in  other  groups 
cleaving  to  the  molecule.  Through  all  these  types  of  reactions,  many  commercial  chemicals 
are  produced  from  benzene.8  The  most  common  commercial  grade  of  benzene  contains  50  to

100  percent  benzene,  the  remainder  consisting  of  toluene,  xylene,  and  other  constituents  that 
distill  below  248°F  (120°C).4 

Laboratory  evaluations  indicate  that  benzene  is  minimally  photochemically 
reactive  in  the  atmosphere  compared  to  the  reactivity  of  other  hydrocarbons.  Reactivity  can  be 
determined  by  comparing  the  influence  that  different  hydrocarbons  have  on  the  oxidation  rate 
of  nitric  oxide  (NO)  to  nitrogen  dioxide  (N02),  or  the  relative  degradation  rate  of  various 
hydrocarbons  when  reacted  with  hydroxyl  radicals  (OH),  atomic  oxygen  or  ozone.  For 
example,  based  on  the  NO  oxidation  test,  the  photochemical  reactivity  rate  of  benzene  was 
determined  to  be  one-tenth  that  of  propylene  and  one-third  that  of  n-hexane.9 

Benzene  shows  long-term  stability  in  the  atmosphere.8  Oxidation  of  benzene 
will  occur  only  under  extreme  conditions  involving  a  catalyst  or  elevated  temperature  or 
pressure.  Photolysis  is  possible  only  in  the  presence  of  sensitizers  and  is  dependent  oa 
wavelength  absorption.  Benzene  does  not  absorb  wavelengths  longer  than  l.lxlO'5  inches  (in) 
(275  nanometers  [nm]).8 

In  laboratory  evaluation,  benzene  is  predicted  to  form  phenols  and  ring  cleavage 
products  when  reacted  with  OH,  and  to  form  quinone  and  ring  cleavage  products  when  reacted 
with  aromatic  hydrogen.6  Other  products  that  are  predicted  to  form  from  indirect  reactions 
with  benzene  in  the  atmosphere  include  aldehydes,  peroxides,  and  epoxides.  Photodegradation 

of  NO_  produces  atomic  oxygen,  which  can  react  with  atmospheric  benzene  to  form  phenols  9 

3 . 2  OVERVIEW  OF  PRODUCTION  AND  USE 


During  the  eighteenth  century,  benzene  was  discovered  to  be  a  component  of 
oil,  gas,  coal  tar,  and  coal  gas.  The  commercial  production  of  benzene  from  coal 
carbonization  began  in  the  United  States  around  1941.  It  was  used  primarily  as  feedstock  in 
the  chemical  manufacturing  industry.10  For  United  States  industries,  benzene  is  currently 
produced  in  the  United  States,  the  Virgin  Islands,  and  Puerto  Rico  by  26  companies  at 


3-4 


36  manufacturing  facilities.11  The  majority  of  benzene  production  facilities  in  the  United  States 
are  found  in  the  vicinity  of  crude  oil  sources,  predominantly  located  around  the  Texas  and 
Louisiana  Gulf  coast.  They  are  also  scattered  throughout  Kentucky,  Pennsylvania,  Ohio, 
Illinois,  and  New  Jersey.11 

Domestic  benzene  production  in  1992  was  estimated  at  2,350  million  gallons 
(gal)  (8,896  million  L).11  Production  was  expected  to  increase  by  approximately  3  to 
3.5  percent  per  year  through  1994.  Exports  of  benzene  in  1993  were  about  23  million  gal  (87 
million  L),  around  1  percent  of  the  total  amount  produced  in  the  United  States.12 

Benzene  is  produced  domestically  by  five  major  processes.12  Approximately 
45  percent  of  the  benzene  consumed  in  the  United  States  is  produced  by  the  catalytic 
reforming/separation  process.11  With  this  process,  the  naphtha  portion  of  crude  oil  is  mixed 
with  hydrogen,  heated,  and  sent  through  catalytic  reactors.13  The  effluent  enters  a  separator 
while  the  hydrogen  is  flashed  off.13  The  resulting  liquid  is  fractionated  and  the  light  ends  (Cj 
to  C4)  are  split.  Catalytic  reformate,  from  which  aromatics  are  extracted,  is  the  product.13 

Approximately  22  percent  of  the  benzene  produced  in  the  United  States  is 
derived  from  ethylene  production.11  Pyrolysis  gasoline  is  a  by-product  formed  from  the  steam 
cracking  of  natural  gas  concentrates,  heavy  naphthas,  or  gas  oils  to  produce  ethylene.14 

Toluene  dealkylation  or  toluene  disproportionation  processes  account  for 
another  25  percent  of  the  United  States  production  of  benzene.11  Toluene  dealkylation 
produces  benzene  and  methane  from  toluene  or  toluene-rich  hydrocarbons  through  cracking 
processes  using  heat  and  hydrogen.  The  process  may  be  either  fixed-bed  catalyst  or  thermal. 
Toluene  disproportionation  produces  benzene  and  xylenes  as  co-products  from  toluene  using 
similar  processes.15 

Three  percent  of  benzene  produced  in  the  United  States  is  derived  from  coke 
oven  light  oil  distillation  at  coke  by-product  plants.11  Light  oil  is  recovered  from  coke  oven 


3-5 


gas,  usually  by  continuous  countercurrent  absorption  in  a  high-boiling  liquid  from  which  it  is 
stripped  by  steam  distillation.9  A  light  oil  scrubber  or  spray  tower  removes  the  light  oil  from 
coke  oven  gas.10  Benzene  is  recovered  from  the  light  oil  by  a  number  of  processes,  including 
fractionating  to  remove  the  lighter  and  heavier  hydrocarbons^  hydrogenation,  and  conventional 
distillation. 


Finally,  about  2  percent  of  benzene  produced  in  the  United  States  is  derived  as  a 
coproduct  from  xylene  isomerization.11  Figure  3-1  presents  a  simplified  production  and  use 
tree  for  benzene.  Each  major  production  process  is  shown,  along  with  the  percent  of  benzene 
derived  from  each  process.  The  primary  uses  of  benzene  and  the  percentage  for  each  use  are 
also  given  in  the  figure. 

The  major  use  of  benzene  is  still  as  a  feedstock  for  chemical  production,  as  in 
the  manufacture  of  ethylbenzene  (and  styrene).  In  1992,  the  manufacture  of  ethylbenzene  (and 
styrene)  accounted  for  53  percent  of  benzene  consumption.12  Ethylbenzene  is  formed  by 
reacting  benzene  with  ethylene  and  propylene  using  a  catalyst  such  as  anhydrous  aluminum 
chloride  or  solid  phosphoric  acid.8  Styrene  is  the  product  of  dehydrogenation  of 
ethylbenzene.9 


Twenty-three  percent  of  the  benzene  supply  is  used  to  produce  cumene.12 
Cumene  is  produced  from  benzene  alkylation  with  propylene  using  solid  phosphoric  acid  as  a 
catalyst.7  Cumene  is  oxidized  to  produce  phenols  and  acetone.12  Phenol  is  used  to  make  resins 
and  resin  intermediates  for  epoxies  and  polycarbonates,  and  caprolactam  for  nylon.12  Acetone 
is  used  to  make  solvents  and  plastics.16 

Cyclohexane  production  accounts  for  13  percent  of  benzene  use.12  Cyclohexane 
is  produced  by  reducing  benzene  hydrogenated  vapors  using  a  nickel  catalyst  at  392 °F 
(200 °C).  Almost  all  of  cyclohexane  is  used  to  make  nylon  or  nylon  intermediates.17

Benzene  Production  Proc©**©* 


3-7 


The  production  of  nitrobenzene,  from  which  aniline  is  made,  accounts  for 
5  percent  of  benzene  consumption.  Nitrobenzene  is  produced  by  the  nitration  of  benzene  with 
a  concentrated  acid  mixture  of  nitric  and  sulfuric  acid.  Nitrobenzene  is  reduced  to  form 
aniline.10  Aniline,  in  turn,  is  used  to  manufacture  isocyanates  for  polyurethane  foams,  plastics, 
and  dyes.18 


Chlorobenzene  production  accounts  for  2  percent  of  benzene  use.  The 
halogenation  of  hot  benzene  with  chlorine  yields  chlorobenzene.  Monochlorobenzene  and 
dichlorobenzene  are  produced  by  halogenation  with  chlorine  using  a  molybdenum  chloride 
catalyst.19 


The  remainder  of  the  benzene  produced  is  consumed  in  the  production  of  other 
chemicals.  Other  benzene-derived  chemicals  include  linear  alkylbenzene,  resorcinol,  and 
hydroquinone. 


Though  much  of  the  benzene  consumed  in  the  United  States  is  used  to 
manufacture  chemicals,  another  important  use  is  in  gasoline  blending.  Aromatic 
hydrocarbons,  including  benzene,  are  added  to  vehicle  fuels  to  enhance  octane  value.  As  lead 
content  of  fuels  is  reduced,  the  amount  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  is  increased  to  maintain 
octane  rating,  such  that  the  benzene  content  in  gasoline  was  increased  in  recent  years.4  The 
concentration  of  benzene  in  refmed  gasoline  depends  on  many  variables,  such  as  gasoline 
grade,  refinery  location  and  processes,  and  crude  source.6  The  various  sources  of  benzene 
emissions  associated  with  gasoline  marketing  are  discussed  in  Section  6.0,  and  benzene 
emissions  associated  with  motor  vehicles  are  discussed  in  Section  8.0  of  this  document. 

3 . 3  OVERVIEW  OF  EMISSIONS 

Sources  of  benzene  emissions  from  its  production  and  uses  are  typical  of  those 
found  at  any  chemical  production  facility: 

•  Process  vents; 


3-8 


Equipment  leaks; 


•  Waste  streams  (secondary  sources); 

•  Transfer  and  storage;  and 

•  Accidental  or  emergency  releases. 

These  sources  of  benzene  emissions  are  described  in  Sections  4.0  and  5.0  of  this  document. 

Miscellaneous  sources  of  benzene  including  oil  and  gas  production,  glycol 
dehydrators,  petroleum  refineries,  gasoline  marketing,  POTWs,  landfills,  and  miscellaneous 
manufacturing  processes  are  addressed  in  Section  6.0.  Combustion  sources  emitting  benzene 
are  addressed  in  Section  7.0.  Section  8.0  presents  a  discussion  of  benzene  emissions  from 
mobile  sources.  Recent  work  by  the  EPA  Office  of  Mobile  Sources  on  benzene  in  vehicle 
exhaust  resulted  in  revised  emission  factors.20  For  off-road  vehicles,  EPA  has  also  completed 
a  recent  study  to  estimate  emissions.

SECTION  4.0 

EMISSIONS  FROM  BENZENE  PRODUCTION 


This  section  presents  information  on  the  four  major  benzene  production  source 
categories  that  may  discharge  benzene  air  emissions.  The  four  major  processes  for  producing 
benzene  are: 

•  Catalytic  reforming/separation; 

•  Toluene  dealkylation  and  disproportionation; 

•  Ethylene  production;  and 

•  Coke  oven  light  oil  distillation. 

For  each  of  these  production  source  categories,  the  following  information  is 
provided  in  the  sections  below:  (1)  a  brief  characterization  of  the  national  activity  in  the 
United  States,  (2)  a  process  description,  (3)  benzene  emissions  characteristics,  and  (4)  control 
technologies  and  techniques  for  reducing  benzene  emissions.  In  some  cases,  the  current 
Federal  regulations  applicable  to  the  source  category  are  discussed.  Table  4-1  lists  U.  S. 
producers  of  benzene  and  the  type  of  production  process  used.11 

Following  the  discussion  of  the  major  benzene  production  source  categories, 
Section  4.5  contains  a  discussion  of  methods  for  estimating  benzene  emissions  from  process 
vents,  equipment  leaks,  storage  tanks,  wastewater,  and  transfer  operations.  These  emissions 
estimation  methods  are  discussed  in  general  terms  and  can  be  applied  to  the  source  categories 
in  this  section  as  well  as  the  source  categories  in  Section  5.0.

existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  listings  or  the  plants  themselves.  The  level  of  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of 
variables  such  as  throughput  and  control  measures,  and  should  be  determined  through  direct  contacts  with  plant  personnel.  Reference  SRI  '93 
indicates  these  data  reflect  changes  made  in  product  locations  as  of  January  1993. 


4.1 


CATALYTIC  REFORMING/SEPARATION  PROCESS 


Production  of  benzene  by  reforming/separation  is  associated  with  the  production 
of  toluene  and  xylene  (BTX  plants).  Catalytic  reforming  is  used  to  prepare  high-octane 
blending  stocks  for  gasoline  production  and  for  producing  aromatics  as  separate  chemicals. 

The  reforming  process,  shown  in  Figure  4-1, 22  accounts  for  about  45  percent  of  all  benzene 
produced  in  the  United  States.12  In  the  following  description  of  the  reforming  process, 
potential  emission  points  are  identified;  however,  not  all  of  the  emission  points  discussed  in 
this  section  are  always  present  at  plants  using  this  production  process.  Some  companies  have 
indicated  that  they  have  closed  systems;  others  have  indicated  that  process  vent  emissions  are 
well-controlled  by  flares  or  scrubbers.22 

4.1.1  Process  Description  for  Catalytic  Reforming/Separation 

The  reforming  process  used  at  BTX  plants  (shown  in  Figure  4-1)  can  greatly 
increase  the  aromatic  content  of  petroleum  fractions  by  such  reactions  as  dehydrogenation, 
isomerization  and  dehydrogenation,  or  cyclization.  The  usual  feedstock  in  this  process  is  a 
straight-run,  hydrocracked,  thermally  cracked,  or  catalytically  cracked  naphtha.  After  the 
naphtha  is  hydrotreated  to  remove  sulfur  (Stream  1),  it  is  mixed  with  recycled  hydrogen 
(Stream  4)  and  heated.  This  feed  (Stream  2)  is  sent  through  catalytic  reactors  in  which  the 
catalyst,  usually  platinum  or  rhenium  chloride,  converts  paraffins  to  aromatic  compounds.  The 
product  stream  ^Stream  3)  consists  of  excess  hydrogen  and  a  reformate  nen  m  aromatics. 
Products  from  the  reactor  (Stream  3)  are  fed  to  the  separation  section,  which  separates  the 
hydrogen  gas  from  the  liquid  product.  The  hydrogen  gas  can  be  recycled  to  the  reactor 
(Stream  4).  The  liquid  product  from  the  separator  (Stream  5)  is  fed  to  a  stabilizer  (not  shown 
in  the  figure).22  The  stabilizer  is  a  fractionator  in  which  more  volatile,  light  hydrocarbons  are 
removed  from  the  high-octane  liquid  product.  The  liquid  is  then  sent  to  a  debutanizer  (not 
shown  in  the  figure).  Aromatics  (benzene,  toluene,  and  mixed  xylenes)  are  then  extracted 
from  the  stabilized  reformate.22 


4-7 


© 


4-8 


Numerous  solvents  are  available  for  the  extraction  of  aromatics  from  the 
stabilized  reformate  stream.  Glycols  (tetraethylene  glycol)  and  sulfolane 
(1,1-tetrahydrothiophene  dioxide)  are  most  commonly  used.  The  processes  in  which  these 
solvents  are  used  are  similar,  so  only  the  glycol  process  is  described  here.  In  the  glycol 
process  shown  in  Figure  4-2,  aromatics  are  separated  from  the  reformate  in  the  extractor.22 
The  raffinate  (stream  2)  is  water- washed  and  stored.  The  dissolved  aromatics  extract 
(Stream  1)  is  steam-stripped  and  the  hydrocarbons  separated  from  the  solvent.  The 
hydrocarbon  stream  (Stream  3)  is  water-washed  to  remove  remaining  solvent  and  is  then 
heated  and  sent  through  clay  towers  to  remove  olefins  (Stream  4).  Benzene,  toluene,  and 
xylene  (Stream  5)  are  then  separated  by  a  series  of  fractionation  steps.22 

4.1.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Catalytic  Reforming/Separation 

The  available  information  on  benzene  emissions  from  process  vents,  equipment 
leaks,  storage  vessels,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems,  and  product  loading  and 
transport  operations  associated  with  benzene  production  using  the  catalytic' 
reforming/separation  process  is  presented  below.  Where  a  literature  review  revealed  no 
source-specific  emission  factors  for  uncontrolled  or  controlled  benzene  emissions  from  these 
emission  points  from  this  process,  the  reader  is  referred  to  Section  4.5  of  this  chapter,  which 
provides  a  general  discussion  of  methods  for  estimating  uncontrolled  and  controlled  benzene 
emissions  from  these  emission  points. 

A  literature  search,  a  review  of  materials  in  the  docket  (A-79-27)  for  some 
National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  (NESHAP)  efforts  on  benzene,  and 
information  provided  by  the  benzene  production  industry  revealed  no  source-specific  emission 
factors  for  benzene  from  catalytic  reforming/separation.22  However,  information  provided  by 
the  benzene  production  industry  indicates  that  BTX  is  commonly  produced  in  closed  systems, 
and  that  any  process  vent  emissions  are  well-controlled  by  flares  and/or  scrubbers.  (See 
Section  4.5  of  this  chapter  for  a  discussion  of  control  devices.)22  Furthermore,  some 
descriptive  data  were  found,  indicating  that  benzene  may  be  emitted  from  the

catalytic/reforming  process  during  catalyst  regeneration  or  replacement,  during  recycling  of 
hydrogen  gas  to  the  reformer,  and  from  the  light  gases  taken  from  the  separator.  These 
potential  emission  points  are  labeled  as  A,  B,  and  C,  respectively,  in  Figure  4-1. 

One  general  estimate  of  the  amount  of  benzene  emitted  by  catalytic 
reforming/separation  has  been  reported  in  the  literature.  In  this  reference,  it  was  estimated 
that  1  percent  of  total  benzene  produced  by  catalytic  reforming  is  emitted.23 

Benzene  may  be  emitted  from  separation  solvent  regeneration,  raffinate  wash 
water,  and  raffinate  in  association  with  the  separation  processes  following  catalytic  reforming. 
These  potential  sources  are  shown  as  A,  B,  and  C,  respectively,  in  Figure  4-2.  However,  no 
specific  data  were  found  showing  emission  factors  or  estimates  for  benzene  emissions  from 
these  potential  sources.  One  discussion  of  the  Sulfolane  process  indicated  that  99.9-percent 
recovery  of  benzene  was  not  unusual.  Therefore,  the  0.1  percent  unrecovered  benzene  may  be 
a  rough  general  estimate  of  the  benzene  emissions  from  separation  processes.23 

4.2  TOLUENE  DEALKYLATION  AND  TOLUENE  DISPROPORTIONATION 

PROCESS 

Benzene  can  also  be  produced  from  toluene  by  hydrodealkylation  (HDA)  or 
disproportionation.  The  amount  of  benzene  produced  from  toluene  depends  on  the  overall 
demand  and  price  for  benzene  because  benzene  produced  by  HDA  costs  more  than  benzene 
produced  through  catalytic  reforming  or  pyrolysis  gasoline/4  At  present,  benzene  production 
directly  from  toluene  accounts  for  almost  30  percent  of  total  benzene  produced.11  Growth  in 
demand  for  toluene  in  gasoline  (as  an  octane-boosting  component  for  gasoline  blending) 
appears  to  be  slowing  because  of  increased  air  quality  legislation  to  remove  aromatics  from 
gasoline.  (At  present,  gasoline  blending  accounts  for  30  percent  of  the  end  use  of  toluene.)  If 
toluene  is  removed  from  the  gasoline  pool  to  any  great  extent,  its  value  is  expected  to  drop 
because  surpluses  will  occur.  In  such  a  scenario,  increased  use  of  toluene  to  produce  benzene 
by  HDA  or  disproportionation  would  be  expected.24  At  present,  production  of  benzene  by  the 
HDA  and  disproportionation  processes  accounts  for  50  percent  of  toluene  end  use.

4.2.1 


Toluene  Dealkylation 


Process  Description 

Hydrodealkylation  of  toluene  can  be  accomplished  through  thermal  or  catalytic 
processes.25  The  total  dealkylation  capacity  is  almost  evenly  distributed  between  the  two 
'  methods.10  As  shown  in  Figure  4-3,  pure  toluene  (92  to  99  percent)  or  toluene  (85  to 
90  percent)  mixed  with  other  heavier  aromatics  or  paraffins  from  the  benzene  fractionation 
column  is  heated  together  with  hydrogen-  containing  gas  to  1,346°F  (730°C)  at  a  specified 
pressure  (Stream  1)  and  is  passed  over  a  dealkylation  catalyst  in  the  reactor  (Stream  2). 
Toluene  reacts  with  the  hydrogen  to  yield  benzene  and  methane.  The  benzene  may  be 
separated  from  methane  in  a  high-pressure  separator  (Stream  3)  by  flashing  off  the 
methane-containing  gas.25 

The  product  is  then  established  (Stream  4),  and  benzene  is  recovered  by 
distillation  in  the  fractionalization  column  (Stream  5). 10  Recovered  benzene  is  sent  to  storage 
(Stream  6).  Unreacted  toluene  and  some  heavy  aromatic  by-products  are  recycled  (Stream  7). 
About  70  to  85  percent  conversion  of  toluene  to  benzene  is  accomplished  per  pass  through  the 
system,  and  the  ultimate  yield  is  95  percent  of  the  theoretical  yield.  Because  there  is  a  weight 
loss  of  about  23  percent,  the  difference  in  toluene  and  benzene  prices  must  be  high  enough  to 
justify  use  of  the  HDA  process. 

Benzene  Emissions 

The  available  information  on  benzene  emissions  from  process  vents,  equipment 
leaks,  storage  vessels,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems,  and  product  loading  and 
transport  operations  associated  with  benzene  production  using  the  toluene  dealkylation  process 
was  reviewed.  No  source-specific  emission  factors  were  found  for  benzene  emissions  from  its 
production  through  dealkylation  of  toluene.  The  reader  is  referred  to  Section  4.5  of  this 


4-12 


chapter,  which  provides  a  general  discussion  of  methods  for  estimating  uncontrolled  and 
controlled  benzene  emissions  from  these  emission  points.  • 

Potential  sources  of  emissions  from  the  dealkylation  process  include  the 
separation  of  benzene  and  methane,  distillation,  catalyst  regeneration,  and  stabilization.23 
These  potential  sources  are  shown  as  emission  points  A,  B,  C,  and  D  respectively,  in 
Figure  4-3. 10,15,25 

4.2.2  Toluene  Disproportionation 

Process  Description 

Toluene  disproportionation  (or  transalkylation)  catalytically  converts  two 
molecules  of  toluene  to  one  molecule  each  of  benzene  and  xylene.24  As  shown  in  Figure  4-4, 
the  basic  process  is  similar  to  toluene  hydrodealkylation,  but  can  occur  under  less  severe 
conditions.15,26  Transalkylation  operates  at  lower  temperatures,  consumes  little  hydrogen,  and 
no  loss  of  carbon  to  methane  occurs  as  with  HDA.24  Toluene  material  is  sent  to  a  separator  for 
removal  of  off-gases  (Stream  3).  The  product  is  then  established  (Stream  4)  and  sent  through 
clay  towers  (Stream  5).  Benzene,  toluene,  and  xylene  are  recovered  by  distillation,  and 
unreacted  toluene  is  recycled  (Stream  6).  Note  that  if  benzene  is  the  only  product  required, 
then  HDA  is  a  more  economical  and  feasible  process.27 

Benzene  Emissions 

No  specific  emission  factors  were  found  for  benzene  emissions  from  its 
production  via  toluene  disproportionation.  Potential  sources  of  benzene  emissions  from  this 
process  are  associated  with  the  separation  of  benzene  and  xylene,  catalyst  regeneration,  and 
heavy  hydrocarbons  that  do  not  break  down.23  These  potential  sources  are  shown  as  points  A, 
B,  and  C,  respectively,  in  Figure  4-4.

ETHYLENE  PRODUCTION 


4.3.1  Process  Description 

Ethylene  is  produced  through  pyrolysis  of  natural  gas  concentrates  or  petroleum 
fractions  such  as  naphthas  and  atmospheric  gas  oils.28  Pyrolysis  gasoline  is  a  liquid  by-product 
formed  as  part  of  the  steam-cracking  process.  The  liquid  pyrolysis  gasoline  is  rich  in  benzene. 
Ethylene  plants  of  the  same  production  capacity,  but  using  different  feedstocks  (ethane/propane 
versus  naphthas/gas  oils),  will  produce  different  amounts  of  pyrolysis  gasoline  with  different 
benzene  concentrations.  For  example,  an  ethylene  plant  producing  1  billion  pounds 
(453.5  gigagrams  [Gg])  of  ethylene  per  year  from  ethane  will  produce  about  16,097,023  lbs 
(7.3  Gg)  pyrolysis  gasoline  with  about  7,497,244  lbs  (3.4  Gg)  benzene  in  the  pyrolysis 
gasoline.28  A  plant  producing  the  same  amount  of  ethylene  from  atmospheric  gas  oils  will 
produce  about  754,134,509  lbs  (342  Gg)  of  pyrolysis  gasoline  containing  213,450,937  lbs 
(96.8  Gg)  benzene.28 

Because  the  benzene  content  of  pyrolysis  gasoline  can  be  high,  some  plants 
recover  motor  gasoline,  aromatics  (BTX),  or  benzene  from  the  pyrolysis  gasoline.  Table  4-1 
lists  facilities  reported  to  recover  benzene  from  pyrolysis  gasoline.  However,  benzene  can  be 
emitted  from  ethylene  plants  that  produce  pyrolysis  gasoline  but  do  not  recover  benzene. 

Table  4-2  lists  ethylene  producers  and  their  locations.  To  locate  most  of  the  potential  sources 
of  benzene  from  ethylene/pyrolysis  gasoline  plants,  information  is  included  here  on 
ethylene/pyrolysis  gasoline  production,  as  well  as  information  on  recovery  of  benzene  from 
pyrolysis  gasoline.  But  because  ethylene  plants  using  naphthas/gas  oils  as  feedstocks  produce 
more  pyrolysis  gasoline  and  more  often  treat  the  gasoline  prior  to  storage,  these  types  of  plants 
are  emphasized  in  the  following  discussion. 

Reference  28  provides  more  detailed  information  on  ethylene  plants  using 
natural  gas  concentrates  as  feedstocks.  In  general,  natural  gas-using  plants  are  less  complex 
than  naphtha-using  plants.  The  potential  emissions  sources  of  benzene  at  the  two  types  of

Ethylene/Pyrolysis  Gasoline  Production 

A  process  flow  diagram  for  a  plant  producing  ethylene  from  naphtha  and/or  gas 
oil  is  shown  in  Figure  4-5.  Many  older  facilities  use  larger  numbers  of  compressors  (in 
parallel)  than  are  shown  in  the  flow  diagrams  in  Figure  4-5.  For  reference,  Table  4-3  lists 
stream  descriptions  and  corresponding  stream  numbers  in  Figure  4-5.  The  description  of  the 
process  is  taken  almost  entirely  from  Reference  28. 

Naphtha  and/or  gas  oil  (Stream  1),  diluted  with  steam,  is  fed  in  parallel  to  a 
number  of  gas-  or  oil-fired  tubular  pyrolysis  furnaces.  The  fuel  gas  and  oil  (Stream  2)  for 
these  furnaces  are  supplied  from  gas  and  oil  fractions  removed  from  the  cracked  gas  in  later 
separation  steps.  Ethane  and  propane,  which  are  present  in  the  cracked  gas  and  are  separated 
in  later  distillation  steps  (Streams  35  and  38),  are  combined  and  recycled  (Stream  3)  through  a 
separate  cracking  furnace.  The  resulting  cracked  gas  is  combined  with  the  cracked  gas  from 
the  naphtha/gas-oil  furnaces  (Stream  5).  The  flue  gas  from  the  pyrolysis  furnaces  is  vented 
(Vent  A  on  Figure  6). 

During  operation,  coke  accumulates  on  the  inside  walls  of  the  reactor  coils,  and 
each  furnace  must  be  periodically  taken  out  of  service  for  removal  of  the  accumulated  coke. 
Normally,  one  furnace  is  out  of  service  for  decoking  at  all  times.  Decoking  is  accomplished 
by  passing  steam  and  air  through  the  coil  while  the  furnace  is  maintained  at  an  elevated 
temperature,  effectively  burning  the  carbon  out  of  the  coil.  While  a  furnace  is  being  decoked, 
the  exhaust  is  diverted  (Stream  7)  to  an  emissions  control  device  (Vent  B)  whose  main  function 
is  to  reduce  particulate  emissions.  The  collected  particles  are  removed  as  a  slurry  (Stream  8). 

The  cracked  gas  (Stream  4)  leaving  the  pyrolysis  furnaces  is  rapidly  cooled 
(quenched)  to  482  to  572 °F  (250  to  300°C)  by  passing  it  through  transfer-line  exchangers,

which  end  pyrolysis  and  simultaneously  generate  steam.  The  streams  from  the  transfer-line 
exchangers  (Stream  5)  are  combined  and  further  quenched  by  the  injection  of  recycled 
pyrolysis  fuel  oil  from  the  gasoline  fractionator  (Stream  6). 

The  remaining  operations  shown  in  Figure  4-5  are  required  for  separation  of  the 
various  product  fractions  formed  in  the  cracking  of  gas  oil  and/or  naphtha;  for  removal  of  acid 
gases  (primarily  hydrogen  sulfide  [H2S])  and  carbon  dioxide  (CCy  and  water;  and  for 
hydrogenation  of  acetylene  compounds  to  olefins  or  paraffins. 

The  quenched  cracked  gas  (Stream  9)  passes  to  the  gasoline  fractionator,  where 
pyrolysis  fuel  oil  is  separated.  Most  of  the  fuel  oil  passes  through  water-cooled  heat 
exchangers  and  is  recycled  (Stream  6)  to  the  preceding  oil-quenching  operation.  The  surplus 
fuel  oil  (Stream  10),  equivalent  to  the  quantity  initially  present  in  the  cracked  gas,  passes  first 
to  the  fuel  oil  stripper,  where  light  fractions  are  removed,  and  then  to  fuel  oil  storage.  The 
light  fractions  (Stream  1 1)  removed  in  the  fuel  oil  stripper  are  recycled  to  the  gasoline 
fractionator.  The  gasoline  fractionator  temperatures  are  well  above  the  vaporization 
temperature  of  water,  and  the  contained  water  remains  as  superheated  steam,  with  the  overhead 
stream  containing  the  lighter  cracked-gas  components. 

The  overhead  stream  from  the  gasoline  fractionator  (Stream  12)  passes  to  the 
quench  tower,  where  the  temperature  is  further  reduced,  condensing  most  of  the  water  and  part 
of  the  C5  and  heavier  compounds.  The  condensed  organic  phase  (Stream  13)  is  stripped  of  the 
lighter  components  in  the  gasoline  stripper  and  is  passed  to  raw  pyrolysis  gasoline  intermediate 
storage  (Stream  14).  Most  of  the  water  phase,  which  is  saturated  with  organics,  is  separated  in 
the  quench  tower  (Stream  15),  passed  through  water-cooled  heat  exchangers  (Stream  16),  and 
then  recycled  to  the  quench  tower  to  provide  the  necessary  cooling.  The  surplus  water 
(Stream  17),  approximately  equivalent  to  the  quantity  of  steam  injected  with  the  pyrolysis 
furnace  feed,  passes  to  the  dilution  steam  generator,  where  it  is  vaporized  and  recycled  as 
steam  to  the  pyrolysis  furnaces.  Blowdown  from  the  recycle  steam  generator  is  removed  as  a 
wastewater  stream  (Stream  18). 


4-26 


On  leaving  the  quench  tower,  the  pyrolysis  gas  is  compressed  to  about  3.5  mPa 
in  five  stages.29  The  overhead  stream  from  the  quench  tower  (Stream  19)  passes  to  a 
centrifugal  charge-gas  compressor  (first  three  stages),  where  it  is  compressed.  Water 
(Stream  20)  and  organic  fractions  (Stream  21)  condensed  during  compression  and  cooling  are 
recycled  to  the  quench  tower  and  gasoline  stripper. 

Lubricating  oil  (seal  oil)  discharged  from  the  charge-gas  compressor  is  stripped 
of  volatile  organics  in  a  separator  pot  before  the  oil  is  recirculated.  The  organic  vapor  is 
vented  to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  G).  Similar  separator  pots  separate  volatile  organics  from 
lubricating  oil  from  both  the  ethylene  and  propylene  refrigeration  compressors  (Streams  48  and 
49). 


Following  compression,  acid  gas  (H2S  and  C02)  is  removed  by  absorption  in 
diethanolamine  (DEA)  or  other  similar  solvents  in  the  amine  wash  tower  followed  by  a  caustic 
wash  step.  The  amine  stripper  strips  the  acid  gas  (Stream  22)  from  the  saturated  DEA  and  the 
DEA  (Stream  23)  is  recycled  to  the  amine  wash  tower.  Very  little  blowdown  from  the  DEA 

cycle  is  required. 

The  waste  caustic  solution,  blowdown  from  the  DEA  cycle,  and  wastewater 
from  the  caustic  wash  tower  are  neutralized,  stripped  of  acid  gas,  and  removed  as  liquid  waste 
streams  (Streams  24  and  25).  The  acid  gas  stripped  from  the  DEA  and  caustic  waste 
(Stream  22)  passes  to  an  emission  control  device  (Vent  D),  primarily  to  control  H2S  emissions. 

Following  acid  gas  removal,  the  remaining  process  gas  stream  (Stream  26)  is 
further  compressed  and  passed  through  drying  traps  containing  a  desiccant,  where  the  water 
content  is  reduced  to  the  low  level  necessary  to  prevent  ice  or  hydrate  formation  in  the  low- 
temperature  distillation  operations.  The  drying  traps  are  operated  on  a  cyclic  basis,  with 
periodic  regeneration  necessary  to  remove  accumulated  water  from  the  desiccant.  The 
desiccant  is  regenerated  with  heated  fuel  gas  and  the  effluent  gas  is  routed  to  the  fuel  system. 
Fouling  of  the  desiccant  by  polymer  formation  necessitates  periodic  desiccant  replacement. 


4-27 


which  results  in  the  generation  of  a  solid  waste  (Stream  27).  However,  with  a  normal 
desiccant  service  life  of  possibly  several  years,  this  waste  source  is  relatively  minor. 

With  the  exception  of  three  catalytic  hydrogenation  operations,  the  remaining 
process  steps  involve  a  series  of  fractionations  in  which  the  various  product  fractions  are 
successively  separated. 

The  demethanizer  separates  a  mixture  of  hydrogen  and  methane  from  the  C2  and 
heavier  components  of  the  process  gas  (Stream  28).  The  demethanizer  overhead  stream 
(hydrogen  and  methane)  is  further  separated  into  hydrogen-rich  and  methane-rich  streams 
(Streams  29  and  30)  in  the  low-temperature  chilling  section.  The  methane-rich  stream  is  used 
primarily  for  furnace  fuel.  Hydrogen  is  required  in  the  catalytic  hydrogenation  operations. 

The  de-ethanizer  separates  the  C2  components  (ethylene,  ethane,  and  acetylene) 
(Stream  31)  from  the  C3  and  heavier  components  (Stream  32).  Following  catalytic 
hydrogenation  of  acetylene  to  ethylene  by  the  acetylene  converter  (Stream  33),  the  ethylene- 
ethane  split  is  made  by  the  ethylene  fractionator.  The  overhead  from  the  ethylene  fractionator 
(Stream  34)  is  removed  as  the  purified  ethylene  product,  and  the  ethane  fraction  (Stream  35)  is 
recycled  to  the  ethane/propane  cracking  furnace.  For  the  separation  of  binary  mixtures  with 
close  boiling  points,  such  as  in  the  ethylene-ethane  fractions,  open  heat  pumps  are 
thermodynamically  the  most  attractive.  Both  heating  and  cooling  duties  have  to  be 
incorporated  into  the  cascade  refrigeration  system  for  optimum  energy  utilization.29 

The  de-ethanizer  bottoms  (C3  and  heavier  compounds)  (Stream  32)  pass  to  the 
depropanizer,  where  a  C3-C4  split  is  made.  The  depropanizer  overhead  stream  (primarily 
propylene  and  propane)  (Stream  36)  passes  to  a  catalytic  hydrogenation  reactor  (C3  converter), 
where  traces  of  propadiene  and  methyl  acetylene  are  hydrogenated.  Following  hydrogenation, 
the  C3  fraction  passes  to  the  propylene  fractionator,  where  propylene  is  removed  overhead  as  a 
purified  product  (Stream  37).  The  propane  (Stream  38)  is  recycled  to  the  ethane/propane 
pyrolysis  furnace. 


4-28 


The  C4  and  heavier  components  (Stream  39)  from  the  depropanizer  pass  to  the 
debutanizer,  where  a  C4-C5  split  is  made.  The  overhead  C4  stream  (Stream  40)  is  removed  as 
feed  to  a  separate  butadiene  process. 

The  stream  containing  C5  and  heavier  compounds  from  the  debutanizer 
(Stream  41)  is  combined  with  the  bottoms  fraction  from  the  gasoline  stripper  as  raw  pyrolysis 
gasoline.  The  combined  stream  (Stream  42)  is  hydrogenated  in  the  gasoline  treatment  section. 
Following  the  stripping  of  lights  (Stream  43),  which  are  recycled  to  the  cracked-gas 
compressor,  the  C5  and  heavier  compounds  (Stream  44)  are  transferred  to  storage  as  treated 
pyrolysis  gasoline.  This  stream  contains  benzene  and  other  aromatics  formed  by  pyrolysis. 

The  three  catalytic  hydrogenation  reactors  for  acetylene,  C3  compounds,  and 
pyrolysis  gasoline  all  require  periodic  regeneration  of  the  catalyst  to  remove  contaminants. 

The  catalyst  is  generally  regenerated  every  four  to  six  months.  At  the  start  of  regeneration,  as 
superheated  steam  (Stream  45)  is  passed  through  a  reactor,  a  mixture  of  steam  and 
hydrocarbons  leaving  the  reactor  (Stream  46)  is  passed  to  the  quench  tower.  After  sufficient 
time  has  elapsed  for  stripping  of  organics  (approximately  48  hours),  the  exhaust  is  directed  to 
an  atmospheric  vent  (Vent  F)  and  a  steam-air  mixture  is  passed  through  the  catalyst  to  remove 
residual  carbon.  This  operation  continues  for  an  additional  24  to  48  hours.  The  presence  of 
air  during  this  phase  of  the  regeneration  prevents  the  vented  vapor  from  being  returned  to  the 
process. 


Because  the  olefms  and  di-olefms  present  in  pyrolysis  gasoline  are  unstable  in 
motor  gasoline  and  interfere  with  extraction  of  aromatics,  they  are  hydrogenated  prior  to 
extraction  of  aromatics.10  Also,  as  mentioned  before,  because  the  benzene  content  of  pyrolysis 
gasoline  can  be  high,  some  plants  recover  motor  gasoline,  aromatics  (BTX),  or  benzene  from 
the  pyrolysis  gasoline. 


4-29 


Recovery  of  Benzene  from  Pyrolysis  Gasoline 

A  process  flow  diagram  for  a  plant  producing  benzene,  toluene,  and  xylenes  by 
hydrogenation  of  pyrolysis  gasoline  is  presented  in  Figure  4-6.  Pyrolysis  gasoline  is  fed  with 
make-up  hydrogen  into  the  first  stage  hydrogenation  reactor  (Stream  1),  where  olefins  are 
hydrogenated.  The  reaction  conditions  are  mild  (104  to  203  °F  [40  to  95  °C]  and  147  to 
588  lb/in2  [10  to  40  atmospheres  pressure]).10 

The  catalyst  in  the  first  stage  reactor  (nickel  or  palladium)  requires  more 
frequent  regeneration  than  most  refinery  catalysts  because  of  the  formation  of  gums.  Catalyst 
may  be  regenerated  about  every  4  months  and  coke  is  burned  off  every  9  to  12  months.10,30 

From  the  first  reactor,  the  hydrogenated  di-olefins  and  olefins  are  sent  to  a 
second  reactor  (Stream  2).  Reactor  effluent  is  then  cooled  and  discharged  into  a  separator 
(Stream  3).  Part  of  the  gas  stream  from  the  separator  is  recycled  back  to  the  reactor  (Stream  4) 
after  being  scrubbed  with  caustic  solution.  The  liquid  phase  from  the  separator  is  sent  to  a 
coalescer  (Stream  5),  where  water  is  used  to  trap  particles  of  coke  formed  in  the  reactor.30 
Next,  the  light  hydrocarbons  are  removed  from  the  liquid  in  the  stabilizer  (Stream  6).  At  this 
point,  the  process  becomes  similar  to  the  solvent  extraction  of  reformate  in  the  catalytic 
reforming  of  naphtha.  The  stabilized  liquid  is  extracted  with  a  solvent,  usually  Sulfolane  or 
tetraethylene  glycol  (Stream  7). 

The  raffinate  (Stream  8)  contains  paraffins  and  may  be  sent  to  a  cracking 
furnace  to  produce  olefins.30  The  solvent  may  be  regenerated  (Streams  9  and  10).  Dissolved 
aromatics  (benzene,  toluene,  and  xylene)  are  separated  from  the  solvent  by  distillation 
(Stream  1 1)  and  sent  through  clay  towers  (Stream  12).  Individual  components  (benzene, 
toluene,  and  xylene)  are  finally  separated  (Stream  13)  and  sent  to  storage. 

The  above  process  may  vary  among  facilities.  For  example.  Stream  1  may  be 
passed  over  additional  catalyst,  such  as  cobalt  molybdenum,  after  being  passed  over  a  nickel  or

volatile  organic  compounds  (V OC)  or  benzene  emissions  from  process  vents  during  normal 
operations.28  Emission  factors  for  benzene  from  sources  at  ethylene  plants  are  shown  in 
Table  4-4.  The  chief  source  of  benzene  emissions  during  normal  operations  is  the  charge  gas 
compressor  lubricating  oil  vent  (Stream  47,  Vent  G  in  Figure  4-5).  The  emission  factors  in 
Table  4-4  were  developed  from  data  supplied  by  ethylene  manufacturers. 

Most  benzene  emissions  from  ethylene  plants  are  intermittent  and  occur  during 
plant  startup  and  shutdown,  process  upsets,  and  emergencies  (Vent  E).  For  example,  benzene 
may  be  emitted  from  pressure  relief  devices,  during  intentional  venting  of  off-specification 
materials,  or  during  depressurizing  and  purging  of  equipment  for  maintenance.28  Charge  gas 
compressor  and  refrigeration  compressor  outages  are  also  potential  sources.  Emissions  from 
these  compressors  are  generally  short  term  in  duration,  but  pollutants  may  be  emitted  at  a  high 
rate. 


In  general,  intermittent  emissions  and  emissions  from  all  pressure  relief  devices 
and  emergency  vents  are  routed  through  the  main  process  vent  (Vent  E  in  Figure  4-5).  The 
vent  usually  is  controlled.  The  relief  valve  from  the  demethanizer  is  usually  not  routed  to  the 
main  vent,  but  the  valve  is  operated  infrequently  and  emits  mainly  hydrogen  and  methane.28 

Potential  sources  of  benzene  such  as  flue  gas  from  the  cracking  furnace 
(Vent  A),  pyrolysis  furnace  decoking  (Vent  B),  acid  gas  removal  (Vent  D),  and  hydrogenation 
catalyst  regeneration  (Vent  F)  generally  are  not  significant  sources.28  Flue  gas  normally 
contains  products  of  hydrogen  and  methane  combustion.  Emissions  from  pyrolysis  furnace 
decoking  consist  of  air,  steam,  C02,  CO,  and  particles  of  unbumed  carbon.28  Emissions  from

acid  gas  removal  are  H2S,  S02,  and  C02;  these  emissions  are  generally  controlled  to  recover 
H2S  as  sulfur  or  convert  H2S  to  S02.  As  discussed  earlier,  catalyst  regeneration  is  infrequent 
and  no  significant  concentrations  of  benzene  have  been  reported  as  present  in  the  emissions.28 

Equipment  leak  benzene  emissions  at  ethylene  plants  may  originate  from  pumps, 
valves,  process  sampling,  and  continuous  process  analysis.  Refer  to  Section  4.5.2  of  this 
document,  for  information  on  emission  estimates  procedures,  and  available  emission  factors. 
Regarding  equipment  leak  component  counts,  totals  of  377  and  719  valves  for  benzene  vapor 
and  benzene  liquid  service  respectively  had  been  reported  for  ethylene  plants.32  Storage  of 
ethylene  in  salt  domes  is  not  a  potential  source  of  benzene  emissions  because  the  ethylene 
generally  does  not  contain  benzene. 

The  emission  factor  for  benzene  from  storage  vessels  shown  in  Table  4-4  was 
derived  from  AP-42  equations.33  No  supporting  data  showing  how  the  equations  were  applied 
were  provided  by  the  emission  factor  reference. 

Secondary  emissions  include  those  associated  with  handling  and  disposal  of 
process  wastewater.  The  emission  factor  in  Table  4-4  was  derived  from  estimates  of 
wastewater  produced  and  the  estimated  percent  of  the  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOC) 
emitted  from  the  wastewater  that  is  benzene. 

No  data  were  available  concerning  benzene  emissions  from  recovering  benzene 
from  pyrolysis  gasoline.  Likely  sources  include  reactor  vents,  compressors,  and  any  vents  on 
the  benzene  column  (Figure  4-6). 

The  primary  control  techniques  available  for  intermittent  emissions  of  benzene 
(pressure  relief  valves,  emergency  vents)  are  flaring  and  combustion  within  industrial  waste 
boilers.  Other  control  methods  are  not  as  attractive  because  the  emissions  are  infrequent  and 
of  short  duration.  The  estimated  control  efficiency  of  flares  is  98  percent  or  greater34  while 
control  efficiencies  for  industrial  waste  boilers  vary  depending  upon  design  and  operation.28 


4-35 


For  additional  discussion  on  flares  and  industrial  waste  boilers  as  control  methods,  see 
Section  4.5.1.  One  ethylene  producer  that  provided  a  process  description  stated  that  all 
process  vents  are  connected  to  flares.  However,  it  was  not  possible  to  determine  how 
prevalent  such  systems  are  for  ethylene  production.35 

Equipment  leak  emissions  may  be  controlled  by  inspection/maintenance  plans  or 
use  of  equipment  such  as  tandem  seal  pumps.  For  additional  discussion  on  equipment  leak 
emissions,  see  Section  4.5.2.  Emissions  from  sampling  lines  can  be  controlled  by  piping 
sample  line  purge  gas  to  the  charge  gas  compressor  or  to  a  combustion  chamber.  Streams 
from  process  analyzers  may  be  controlled  in  the  same  manner.28 

The  primary  means  of  controlling  emissions  from  pyrolysis  gasoline  or  naphtha 
feedstock  storage  is  floating  roof  tanks.  Emissions  can  be  reduced  by  85  percent  when  internal 
floating  roof  devices  are  used.28  For  additional  discussion  on  storage  tank  emissions,  see 
Section  4.5.3. 

4.4  COKE  OVEN  AND  COKE  BY-PRODUCT  RECOVERY  PLANTS 


Most  coke  is  produced  in  the  U.S.  using  the  by-product  recovery  process.  In 
1994,  there  was  one  plant  that  used  a  “nonrecovery”  process.  This  section  will  focus  on  the 
by-product  recovery  process  because  there  are  so  few  nonrecovery  facilities  in  operation.296 

4.4.1  Process  Description 

Although  most  benzene  is  obtained  from  petroleum,  some  is  recovered  through 
distillation  of  coke  oven  light  oil  at  coke  by-product  recovery  plants.  Light  oil  is  a  clear 
yellow-brown  oil  that  contains  coke  oven  gas  components  with  boiling  points  between  32  and 
392°F  (0  and  200°C).26  Most  by-product  recovery  plants  recover  light  oil,  but  not  all  plants 
refine  it.  About  3.4  to  4.8  gal  (13  to  18  liters  [L])  of  light  oil  can  be  recovered  from  the  coke 


4-36 


oven  gas  evolved  in  coke  ovens  producing  0.91  ton  (1  megagram  [Mg])  of  furnace  coke  (3  to 
4  gal/ton  [10.3  to  13.7  L/Mg]).  Light  oil  itself  is  60  to  85  percent  benzene.37 

The  coke  by-product  industry  recovers  various  components  of  coke  oven  gas 

including: 

•  Coal  tar,  a  feedstock  for  producing  electrode  binder  pitch,  roofing  pitch, 
road  tar,  and  numerous  basic  chemicals; 

•  Light  oil,  a  source  of  benzene  and  other  light  aromatic  chemicals; 

•  Ammonia  or  ammonium  sulfate,  for  agriculture  and  as  chemical 
feedstocks; 

•  Sulfur,  a  basic  chemical  commodity; 

•  Naphthalene,  used  primarily  as  an  intermediate  in  the  production  of 
organic  chemicals;  and 

•  Coke  oven  gas,  a  high-quality  fuel  similar  to  natural  gas.38 

Because  it  is  contained  in  the  coke  oven  gas,  benzene  may  be  emitted  from 
processes  at  by-product  recovery  plants  that  do  not  specifically  recover  or  refine  benzene. 
Table  4-5  lists  coke  oven  batteries  with  by-product  recovery  plants  in  the  United  States.36 
Figure  4-7  shows  a  process  flow  diagram  for  a  representative  coke  by-product  recovery 
plant.37  39  The  figure  does  not  necessarily  reflect  any  given  plant,  nor  does  it  include  all 
possible  operations  that  could  be  found  at  a  given  facility.  The  number  of  units  and  the  types 
of  processes  used  varies  among  specific  plants.  For  example,  naphthalene  recovery  is  not 
practiced  at  all  plants,  and  some  plants  do  not  separate  benzene  from  the  light  oil.  Therefore, 
it  is  advisable  to  contact  a  specific  facility  to  determine  which  processes  are  used  before 
estimating  emissions  based  on  data  in  this  document. 

Coal  is  converted  to  coke  in  coke  ovens.  About  99  percent  of  the  U.S. 
production  of  coke  uses  the  slot  oven  process,  also  referred  to  as  the  Kopper-Becker 
by-product  coking  process;  the  other  1  percent  is  produced  in  the  original  beehive  ovens.

etc.  The  reader  should  verify  the  existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  lists  and/or  the 
plants  themselves.  The  level  of  benzene  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of  variables 
such  as  capacity,  throughput  and  control  measures,  and  should  be  determined  through  direct  contacts 
with  plant  personnel.  These  operating  plants  and  locations  were  current  as  of  April  1,  1992.

Each  oven  has  3  main  parts:  coking  chambers,  heating  chambers,  and  regenerative 
chambers.  All  of  the  chambers  are  lined  with  refractory  (silica)  brick.  The  coking  chamber 
has  ports  in  the  top  for  charging  of  the  coal.22 

Each  oven  is  typically  capable  of  producing  batches  of  10  to  55  tons  (9.1  to 
49.9  Mg)  of  coke  product.  A  coke  oven  battery  is  a  series  of  20  to  100  coke  ovens  operated 
together,  with  offtake  flues  on  either  end  of  the  ovens  to  remove  gases  produced.  The 
individual  ovens  are  charged  and  discharged  at  approximately  equal  time  intervals  during  the 
coke  cycle.  The  resulting  constant  flow  of  evolved  gas  from  all  the  ovens  in  a  battery  helps 
to  maintain  a  balance  of  pressure  in  the  flues,  collecting  main,  and  stack.  Process  heat 
comes  from  the  combustion  of  gases  between  the  coke  chambers.  Approximately  40  percent 
of  cleaned  oven  gas  (after  the  removal  of  its  byproducts)  is  used  to  heat  the  coke  ovens.  The 
rest  is  either  used  in  other  production  processes  related  to  steel  production  or  sold.  Coke 
oven  gas  is  the  most  common  fuel  for  underfiring  coke  ovens.22  The  coking  time  affects  the 
type  of  coke  produced.  Furnace  coke  results  when  coal  is  coked  for  about  15  to  18  hours. 
Foundry  coke,  which  is  less  common  and  is  of  higher  quality  (because  if  is  harder  and  less 
readily  ignited),  results  when  coal  is  coked  for  about  25  to  30  hours.37 


The  coking  process  is  actually  thermal  distillation  of  coal  to  separate  volatile 
and  nonvolatile  components.  Pulverized  coal  is  charged  into  the  top  of  an  empty,  but  hot, 
coke  oven.  Peaks  of  coal  form  under  the  charging  ports  and  a  leveling  har  smoothes  them 

out.  Aficr  the  leveling  bar  is  withdrawn,  the  topside  charging  ports  are  closed  and  the 

coking  process  begins. 


Heat  for  the  coke  ovens  is  supplied  by  a  combustion  system  under  the  coke 
oven.  The  gases  evolved  during  the  thermal  distillation  are  removed  through  the  offtake 
main  and  sent  to  the  by-product  recovery  plant  for  further  processing. 


4-42 


After  coking  is  completed  (no  volatiles  remain),  the  coke  in  the  chamber  is 
ready  to  be  removed.  Doors  on  both  sides  of  the  chamber  are  opened  and  a  ram  is  inserted 
into  the  chamber.  The  coke  is  pushed  out  of  the  oven  in  less  than  1  minute,  through  the  coke 
guide  and  into  a  quench  car.  After  the  coke  is  pushed  from  the  oven,  the  doors  are  cleaned 
and  repositioned.  The  oven  is  then  ready  to  receive  another  charge  of  coal. 

The  quench  car  carrying  the  hot  coke  moves  along  the  battery  tracks  to  a  quench 
tower  where  approximately  270  gallons  of  water  per  ton  of  coke  (1,130  L  of  water  per  Mg) 
are  sprayed  onto  the  coke  mass  to  cool  it  from  about  2000  to  180°F  (1100  to  80°C)  and  to 
prevent  it  from  igniting.  The  quench  car  may  rely  on  a  movable  hood  to  collect  particulate 
emissions,  or  it  may  have  a  scrubber  car  attached.  The  car  then  discharges  the  coke  onto  a 
wharf  to  drain  and  continue  cooling.  Gates  on  the  wharf  are  opened  to  allow  the  coke  to  fall 
onto  a  conveyor  that  carries  it  to  the  crushing  and  screening  station.  After  sizing,  coke  is 
sent  to  the  blast  furnace  or  to  storage. 

As  shown  in  Figure  4-7,  coke  oven  gas  leaves  the  oven  at  about  1292°F 
(700  °C)  and  is  immediately  contacted  with  flushing  liquor  (Stream  1).  The  flushing  liquor 
reduces  the  temperature  of  the  gas  and  acts  as  a  collecting  medium  for  condensed  tar.  The 
gas  then  passes  into  the  suction  main.  About  80  percent  of  the  tar  is  separated  from  the  gas 
in  the  mains  as  “heavy”  tar  and  is  flushed  to  the  tar  decanter  (Stream  2). 37  Another 
20  percent  of  the  tar  is  “light”  tar,  which  is  cleaner  and  less  viscous,  and  is  condensed  and 
collected  in  the  primary  cooler.39  Smaller  amounts  of  “tar  fog”  are  removed  from  the  gas  by 
collectors  (electrostatic  precipitators  or  gas  scrubbers)  (Stream  4).37  Light  tar  and  tar  fog  is 
collected  in  the  tar  intercept  sump  (stream  6)  and  is  routed  to  the  tar  decanter  (Stream  5). 

Depending  on  plant  design,  the  heavy  and  light  tar  streams  (Streams  2  and  5) 
may  be  merged  or  separated.  The  tar  is  separated  from  the  flushing  liquor  by  gravity  in  the  tar 
decanter.  Recovered  flushing  liquor  is  returned  to  the  Flushing  Liquor  Circulation  Tank 
(Stream7)  and  re-used.  Tar  from  the  decanter  is  further  refined  in  the  tar  dewater  tank 


4-43 


(Stream  3).  Tar  may  be  sold  to  coal  tar  refiners  or  it  may  be  refined  farther  on  site.  Tar  and 
tar  products  are  stored  on  site  in  tanks. 

Wastewater  processing  can  recover  phenol  (Stream  8)  and  ammonia,  with  the 
ammonia  routinely  being  reinjected  into  the  gas  stream  (Stream  9).  Ammonia  salts  or 
ammonia  can  be  recovered  by  several  processes.  Traditionally,  the  ammonia-containing  coke 
oven  gas  is  contacted  with  sulfuric  acid  (Stream  10),  and  ammonium  sulfate  crystals  are 
recovered  (Stream  11).  The  coke  oven  gas  from  which  tar  and  ammonia  have  been 
recovered  is  sent  to  the  final  cooler  (Stream  12).  The  final  cooler  is  generally  a  spray  tower, 
with  water  serving  as  the  cooling  medium.37 

Three  types  of  final  coolers  and  naphthalene  recovery  technologies  are 
currently  used:  (1)  direct  cooling  with  water  and  naphthalene  recovery  by  physical 
separation,  (2)  direct  cooling  with  water  and  naphthalene  recovery  in  the  tar  bottom  of  the 
final  cooler,  and  (3)  direct  cooling  with  wash  oil  and  naphthalene  recovery  in  the  wash  oil.37 
Most  plants  use  direct  water  final  coolers  and  recover  naphthalene  by  physical  separation.37 
In  this  method,  naphthalene  in  the  coke  oven  gas  is  condensed  in  the  cooling  medium  and 
separated  by  gravity  (Stream  13).  After  the  naphthalene  is  separated,  the  water  is  sent  to  a 
cooling  tower  (Stream  14)  and  recirculated  to  the  final  cooler  (Stream  15).  The  coke  oven 
gas  that  leaves  the  final  cooler  is  sent  to  the  light  oil  processing  segment  of  the  plant 
(Stream  16). 


As  shown  in  Figure  4-7,  light  oil  is  primarily  recovered  from  coke  oven  gas 
by  continuous  countercurrent  absorption  in  a  high-boiling  liquid  from  which  it  is  stripped  by 
steam  distillation.10  Coke  oven  gas  is  introduced  into  a  light  oil  scrubber  (Stream  16). 
Packed  or  tray  towers  have  been  used  in  this  phase  of  the  process,  but  spray  towers  are  now 
commonly  used.10  Wash  oil  is  introduced  into  the  top  of  the  tower  (Stream  17)  and  is 
circulated  through  the  contacting  stages  of  the  tower  at  around  0.11  to  .019  gal/ft3  (1.5  to 
2.5  liters  per  cubic  meter  [L/m3])  of  coke  oven  gas.39  At  a  temperature  of  about  86°F 
(30 °C),  a  light  oil  scrubber  will  remove  95  percent  of  the  light  oil  from  coke  oven  gas.  The

benzene-containing  wash  oil  is  steam-stripped  (Stream  18)  to  recover  the  light  oil.39  Steam 
and  stripped  vapors  are  condensed  and  separated  (Streams  19  and  20).  The  light  oil  is  sent  to 
storage  (Stream  2 1).37,39 

To  recover  the  benzene  present  in  the  light  oil,  processes  such  as  Litol 
(licensed  by  Houdry)  or  Hydeal  (licensed  by  UOP)  are  used.  Figure  4-8  shows  a  process 
diagram  of  the  Litol  process.  The  following  discussion  of  the  Litol  process  is  drawn  from 
two  published  descriptions  of  the  process.40,41 

The  light  oil  is  preffactionated  (Stream  1)  to  remove  the  C5  and  lighter 
fractions,  and  the  C9  and  heavier  fractions  (Stream  2).  The  remaining  “heart  cut”  is  sent  to  a 
vaporizer,  where  it  contacts  gas  with  a  high  hydrogen  content  (Stream  3).  The  light  oil  and 
hydrogen  then  flow  to  a  pretreat  reactor  (Stream  4),  where  styrene,  di-olefins,  and  some 
sulfur  compounds  are  hydrogenated  (at  about  572  °F  [300  °Cj).  The  partially  hydrogenated 
stream  is  heated  by  the  charge  heater  to  the  temperature  required  for  the  main  reactor 
(Stream  5). 


The  stream  is  then  sent  through  a  set  of  fixed-bed  (Litol)  reactors  (Streams  6 
and  7),  where  all  remaining  sulfur  compounds  are  converted  to  H2S  and  organics  are 
dehydrogenated  or  dealky lated.  The  reactor  effluent  is  cooled  by  post-reactor  exchangers 
(Streams  8  and  9).  At  the  flash  drum,  aromatics  are  condensed  and  separated  from  the  gas 
stream  (Stream  10).  At  the  stabilizer,  additional  gas  is  removed,  resulting  in  a  hot  liquid  fuel 
for  clay  treatment  (Stream  11).  The  clay  treater  removes  the  last  trace  of  unsaturates  from 
the  aromatics  (Stream  12).  Conventional  distillation  yields  pure  benzene  followed  by  pure 
toluene  (Stream  13).  Benzene  product  may  then  be  sent  to  storage  (Stream  14). 40,41 

4.4.2  Benzene  Emissions 

Benzene  may  be  emitted  from  many  points  in  a  coke  and  coke  by-product 
plant;  emissions  are  not  limited  to  the  benzene  recovery  section  of  the  process.  The  coke 


4-46 


ovens  themselves  are  potential  sources  of  benzene  emissions  from  the  charging  operation, 
leaking  coke  oven  doors,  topside  port  lids  and  offtake  systems  on  the  topside  of  the  battery, 
collecting  mains,  and  bypass/bleeder  stacks.36 

During  charging,  moist  coal  contacts  the  hot  oven  floor  and  walls  and,  as  a 
result,  the  release  of  volatile  components  begins  immediately.  Control  of  charging  emissions 
is  more  dependent  on  operating  procedures  than  on  equipment.  Control  options  include 
staged  charging,  sequential  charging,  and  use  of  wet  scrubbers  on  larry  cars  (the  mobile 
hoppers  that  discharge  the  coal). 

Staged  charging  involves  pouring  coal  into  the  coke  ovens  so  that  an  exit  space 
for  the  generated  gases  is  constantly  maintained.42  The  hoppers  delivering  the  coal  are 
discharged  such  that  emissions  are  contained  in  the  ovens  and  collecting  mains  by  steam 
aspiration.  Generally,  a  maximum  of  two  hoppers  are  discharging  at  the  same  time. 

In  sequential  charging,  the  first  hoppers  are  still  discharging  when  subsequent 
hoppers  begin  discharging  coal.  As  with  staged  charging,  the  coke  ovens  are  under 
aspiration  in  sequential  charging.  The  sequential  charging  procedure  is  designed  to  shorten 
the  charging  time. 

In  the  use  of  wet  scrubbers  on  larry  cars,  the  scrubber  emissions  are  contained 
by  hoods  or  shrouds  that  are  lowered  over  the  charging  ports. 

Another  potential  source  of  benzene  emissions  at  coke  ovens  is  leaking  doors. 
The  doors  are  sealed  before  the  coking  process  begins.  Some  doors  have  a  flexible  metal 
band  or  rigid  knife  edge  as  a  seal.  The  seal  is  formed  by  condensation  of  escaping  tars  on 
the  door's  metal  edge.  Other  doors  are  sealed  by  hand  by  troweling  a  mixture  into  the 
opening  between  the  coke  oven  door  and  door  frame.  After  the  coking  process  is  complete, 
the  doors  are  opened  to  push  the  coked  coal  out  into  special  railroad  cars  called  quench  cars 
for  transport  to  the  quench  tower.  Quenched  coke  is  then  discharged  onto  a  “coke  wharf”  to 


4-47 


allow  quench  water  to  drain  and  to  let  the  coke  cool.  Control  techniques  for  leaking  doors 
include  oven  door  seal  technology,  pressure  differential  devices,  hoods/shrouds  over  the 
doors,  and  the  use  of  more  efficient  operating/maintenance  procedures.42 

Oven  door  seal  technology  relies  on  the  principle  of  producing  a  resistance  to 
the  flow  of  gases  out  of  the  coke  oven.  This  resistance  may  be  produced  by  a  metal-to-metal 
seal,  a  resilient  soft  seal,  or  a  luted  seal  (applying  a  slurry  mixture  of  clay,  coal,  and  other 
materials).  Small  cracks  and  defects  in  the  seal  allow  pollutants  to  escape  from  the  coke 
oven  early  in  the  cycle.  The  magnitude  of  the  leak  is  determined  by  the  size  of  the  opening, 
the  pressure  drop  between  the  oven  and  the  atmosphere,  and  the  composition  of  the 
emissions. 


The  effectiveness  of  a  pressure  differential  control  device  depends  on  the 
ability  of  the  device  to  reduce  or  reverse  the  pressure  differential  across  any  defects,  in  the 
door  seal.  These  systems  either  provide  a  channel  to  permit  gases  that  evolve  at  the  bottom 
of  the  oven  to  escape  to  the  collecting  main,  or  the  systems  provide  external  pressure  on  the 
seal  through  the  use  of  steam  or  inert  gases. 

Oven  door  emissions  also  can  be  reduced  by  collecting  the  leaking  gases  and 
particulates  and  subsequently  removing  these  pollutants  from  the  air  stream.  A  suction  hood 
above  each  door  with  a  wet  electrostatic  precipitator  for  fume  removal  is  an  example  of  this 
type  of  system. 

Other  control  techniques  rely  on  operating  and  maintenance  procedures  rather 
than  only  hardware.  Operating  procedures  for  emission  reduction  could  include  changes  in 
the  oven  cycle  times  and  temperatures,  the  amount  and  placement  of  each  charge,  and  any 
adjustments  of  the  end-door  while  the  oven  is  on  line.  Maintenance  procedures  include 
routine  inspection,  replacement,  and  repair  of  control  devices  and  doors. 


4-48 


Topside  leaks  are  those  occurring  from  rims  of  charging  ports  and  standpipe 
leaks  on  the  top  of  the  coke  oven.  These  leaks  are  primarily  controlled  by  proper 
maintenance  and  operating  procedures  that  include:42 

•  Replacement  of  warped  lids; 

•  Cleaning  carbon  deposits  or  other  obstructions  from  the  mating 
surfaces  of  lids  or  their  seats; 

•  Patching  or  replacing  cracked  standpipes; 

•  Sealing  lids  after  a  charge  or  whenever  necessary  with  lute;  and 

•  Sealing  cracks  at  the  base  of  a  standpipe  with  lute. 

Luting  mixtures  are  generally  prepared  by  plant  personnel  according  to 
formulas  developed  by  each  plant.  The  consistency  (thickness)  of  the  mixture  is  adjusted  to 
suit  different  applications. 

There  are  few  emission  factors  specifically  for  benzene  emissions  at  coke 
ovens.  One  test  that  examined  emissions  of  door  leaks  detected  benzene  in  the  emissions.42 
The  coke  oven  doors  being  tested  were  controlled  with  a  collecting  device,  which  then  fed 
the  collected  emissions  to  a  wet  electrostatic  precipitator.  Tests  at  the  precipitator  inlet 
showed  benzene  concentrations  of  1.9  x  10'7  to  6.2  x  10‘7  lb/ft3  (1  to  3  parts  per  million 
[ppm]  or  about  3  to  10  milligrams  per  cubic  meter  [Mg/m3]).  These  data  translated  into  an 
estimated  benzene  emission  factor  of  1 .3  lb  to  5.3  lb  (0  6  to  2  4  kilograms  [kg])  benzene  pe*- 
hour  of  operation  for  coke  oven  doors.  In  addition  to  coke  oven  door  emissions,  benzene 
may  also  be  emitted  from  the  coke  oven  bypass  stack  at  a  rate  of  22  lbs/ton  of  coal  charged 
(11,000  g/Mg)  uncontrolled,  0.22  Ibs/ton  of  coal  charged  (110  g/Mg)  controlled  with 
flare.296  No  additional  emission  factors  for  benzene" and  coke  ovens  were  found  in  the 
literature.  However,  an  analysis  of  coke  oven  gas  indicated  a  benzene  content  of 
1.3  x  10‘3  to  2.2  x  10‘3  lb/ft3  (21.4  to  35.8  grams  per  cubic  meter  [g/m3]). 


4-49 


Other  potential  sources  of  benzene  emissions  associated  with  the  by-product 
recovery  plant  are  given  in  Table  4-6,  along  with  emission  factors.37,43 

Equipment  leaks  may  also  contribute  to  benzene  emissions.  Emission  factors 
for  pumps,  valves,  etc.,  at  furnace  coke  and  foundry  coke  by-product  recovery  plants  are 
shown  in  Tables  4-7  and  4-8,  respectively.37,43  The  following  paragraphs  describe  the 
potential  sources  of  benzene  emissions  listed  in  Tables  4-6,  4-7,  and  4-8.  Emission  sources 
and  control  technologies  are  described  in  groups  of  related  processes,  beginning  with  the 
final  cooling  unit. 

The  fmal  cooling  unit  itself  is  not  a  source  of  benzene  because  coolers  are 
closed  systems.  However,  the  induced-draft  cooling  towers  used  in  conjunction  with 
direct-water  and  tar-bottom  fmal  coolers  are  potential  sources  of  benzene.  Benzene  can  be 
condensed  in  the  direct-contact  cooling  water,  and  in  the  cooling  tower,  lighter  components 
(such  as  benzene)  will  be  stripped  from  the  recirculating  cooling  water.  The  emission  factor 
of  0.54  pound  per  ton  (lb/ton)  (270  g/Mg)  coke  shown  in  Table  4-6  was  based  on  actual 
measurements  of  benzene  concentrations  and  volumetric  gas  flow  rates  taken  from  source 
testing  reports.37 


Use  of  a  wash  oil  fmal  cooler  effectively  eliminates  the  benzene  emissions 
associated  with  direct  water  or  tar  bottom  coolers  because  the  wash  oil  is  cooled  by  an 
indirect  heat  exchanger,  thereby  eliminating  the  need  for  a  cooling  tower.37  Wash  oil  is 
separated  after  it  leaves  the  heat  exchanger  and  recirculates  back  through  the  circulation  tank 
to  the  final  cooler. 

Coke  by-product  recovery  plants  may  recover  naphthalene  by  condensing  it 
from  the  coke  oven  gas  and  separating  it  from  the  cooling  water  by  flotation.  Benzene  may 
be  emitted  from  most  naphthalene  separation  and  processing  operations.37  Vapors  from 
naphthalene  separation  tanks  have  been  reported  to  contain  benzene,  benzene  homologs,  and 
other  aromatic  hydrocarbons.37  The  emission  factors  for  naphthalene  separation  and

processing  shown  in  Table  4-6  are  based  on  source  testing  data  from  a  flotation  unit,  drying 
tank,  and  melt  pit  at  a  coke  by-product  recovery  plant.37  ' 

Benzene  may  also  be  emitted  from  the  light  oil  plant,  which  includes  the 
light-oil  condenser  vent,  light  oil  decanter,  storage  tank,  intercepting  sumps,  the  wash-oil 
decanter,  wash-oil  circulation  tank(s),  and  BTX  storage.  A  control  technique  required  by  the 
benzene  NESHAP  is  the  use  of  gas  blanketing  with  clean  coke  oven  gas  from  the  gas  holder 
(or  battery  underfire  system).44  With  this  technology,  a  positive  (or  negative)  pressure 
blanket  of  clean  coke  oven  gas  is  piped  to  the  light  oil  plant  and  the  enclosed  sources  are 
connected  to  the  blanketing  line.  Using  a  series  of  piping  connections  and  flow  inducing 
devices  (if  necessary),  vapor  emissions  from  the  enclosed  sources  are  transported  back  into 
the  clean  gas  system  (the  coke-oven  battery  holder,  the  collecting  main,  or  another  point  in 
the  by-product  recovery  process). 

Ultimate  control  of  the  vapors  is  accomplished  by  the  combustion  of  the  coke 
oven  gas.37  Such  systems  are  currently  in  use  at  some  by-product  recovery  plants  and 
reportedly  have  operated  without  difficulty.  Examples  of  gases  that  may  be  used  as  the  gas 
blanket  include  dirty  or  clean  coke  gas,  nitrogen,  or  natural  gas.37  The  control  efficiency  is 
estimated  to  be  98  percent.37,44  The  control  technique  required  by  the  benzene  NESHAP  for 
the  light  oil  sump  is  a  tightly  fitting,  gasketed  cover  with  an  estimated  96-percent 
efficiency.44  The  emission  factors  for  benzene  sources  in  the  light  oil  plant  shown  in 
Table  4-6  are  based  on  source  tests.37 

Sources  of  benzene  emissions  from  tar  processing  include  the  tar  decanter,  the 
tar-intercepting  sump,  tar  dewatering  and  storage,  and  the  flushing-liquor  circulation  tank. 
Emission  factors  for  these  sources  are  shown  in  Table  4-6. 

Benzene  emissions  from  the  tar  decanter  are  sensitive  to  two  operating 
practices:  residence  time  in  the  separator  and  optimal  heating  of  the  decanter.37  These  two 
variables  should  be  kept  in  mind  when  using  the  emission  factors  presented  in  Table  4-6. 


4-58 


Benzene  is  emitted  from  tar  decanters  through  vents.  Coke  oven  gas  can  be  mechanically 
entrained  with  the  tar  and  liquor  that  are  fed  into  the  decanter.  Because  tar  is  fed  into  the 
decanter  at  a  slightly  higher  pressure,  the  coke  oven  gas  will  build  up  in  the  decanter  if  it  is 
not  vented.37  Emissions  were  measured  at  tar  decanters  at  several  locations  in  the  United 
States  and  the  emission  factor  shown  in  Table  4-6  is  the  average  of  the  test  values.37 

The  water  that  separates  from  the  tar  in  the  decanter  is  flushing  liquor,  which 
is  used  to  cool  the  gas  leaving  the  coke  oven.  Excess  flushing  liquor  is  stored  in  the  excess 
ammonia  liquor  tank.  Benzene  may  be  emitted  from  the  flushing  liquor  circulation  tank  and 
the  excess  ammonia  liquor  tank.  The  emission  factor  of  0.026  lb  benzene/ton  (13  g 
benzene/Mg)  coke  produced  was  derived  from  a  source  test  of  fugitive  emissions  from  a 
primary  cooler  condensate  tank.  It  was  assumed  that  the  condensate  tank  was  similar  in 
design  and  in  liquids  stored  as  the  ammonia  liquor  and  the  flushing  liquor  circulation 
tanks.296  The  actual  benzene  emission  rate  from  the  flushing  liquor  circulation  tank  and 
excess  ammonia  liquor  tank  depends  on  the  number  of  tanks,  the  number  of  vents,  and  the 
geometry  of  the  tanks.37 

The  tar-intercepting  sump  is  a  type  of  decanter  that  accepts  light  tar  and 
condensate  from  the  primary  cooler.  Some  of  this  condensate  may  be  used  to  make  up 
flushing  liquor  and  some  may  be  forwarded  to  ammonia  recovery.37  No  significant  benzene 
emissions  have  been  identified  from  the  recovery  of  ammonia,  but  benzene  can  be  emitted 
from  the  intercepting  sump.  An  emission  factor  of  0.019  Ib/ton  (9.5  g  benzene/Mg)  coke 
was  reported  in  the  literature.296 

Tar  dewatering  may  be  accomplished  by  steam  heating  or  centrifugal 
separation  or  a  combination  of  the  two  methods.  Use  of  centrifugal  separation  will  probably 
not  be  a  source  of  benzene  emissions  directly,  but  benzene  may  be  emitted  as  a  fugitive 
emission  if  storage  vessels  are  used.39  In  steam  heating,  benzene  could  be  driven  off  in  the 
vapors.  The  emission  factor  for  tar  dewatering  in  Table  4-6  was  derived  by  averaging  three 
factors  (0.082,  0.019,  and  0.0258  lb  benzene/ton  coke  [41,  9.5,  and  12.9  g  benzene/Mg 


4-59 


coke])  based  on  source  tests  at  tar  dewatering  tanks.37  Gas  blanketing  is  the  control 
technology  required  by  the  benzene  NESHAP  for  tar  processing. 

The  final  source  of  benzene  emissions  at  coke  by-product  recovery  plants  is 
leaks  from  equipment  such  as  pumps,  valves,  exhausters,  pressure  relief  devices,  sampling 
connection  systems,  and  open-ended  lines.  Emission  factors  are  shown  in  Tables  4-7  and  4-8 
and  are  based  on  emission  factors  from  a  comprehensive  survey  of  petroleum  refineries  and 
the  percent  of  benzene  in  the  liquid  associated  with  each  type  of  equipment.37  Two  different 
sets  of  emission  factors  are  presented,  one  set  for  a  plant  practicing  light  oil  and  BTX 
recovery  and  one  set  for  a  plant  producing  refined  benzene  in  addition  to  light  oil.  Emission 
factors  for  exhausters  were  derived  by  multiplying  the  VOC  emission  factor  for  compressors 
in  hydrogen  service  and  refineries  by  0.235,  the  measured  ratio  of  benzene  to  nonmethane 
hydrocarbons  present  in  the  coke  oven  gas  at  the  exhausters.37 

To  control  benzene  emissions  from  process  vessels,  storage  tanks,  and  tar- 
interrupting  sumps  as  required  by  the  benzene  NESHAP,  all  openings  must  be  enclosed  or 
sealed.  All  gases  must  be  routed  to  a  gas  collection  system  (or  similar  configuration)  where 
the  benzene  in  the  gas  will  be  removed  or  destroyed.  Alternately,  the  gases  may  be  routed 
through  a  closed  vent  system  to  a  carbon  absorber  or  vapor  incinerator  that  is  at  least 
98  percent  efficient.  See  Section  4.5  for  a  discussion  of  these  types  of  process  control 
devices.44  The  control  techniques  required  by  the  benzene  NESHAP  to  control  benzene 
emissions  from  equipment  leaks  are  presented  in  Table  4-9. 

For  the  nonrecovery  process,  benzene  emissions  for  coal  charging  are 
3.6  x  10'5  lb/ton  of  coal  charged  (1.8  x  10'2  g/Mg).  Emissions  from  pushing  and  quenching 
are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  from  the  by-product  recovery  process.  Additional 
benzene  emissions  occur  from  the  combustion  stack  of  nonrecovery  batteries  at  the  rate  of 
5.1  x  W4  lb/ton  of  coal  charged  (0.26  g/Mg).296

4.5  METHODS  FOR  ESTIMATING  BENZENE  EMISSIONS  FROM  EMISSION 

SOURCES 

In  this  section,  the  sources  of  benzene  emissions  from  process  vents,  equipment 
leaks,  storage  tanks,  wastewater,  and  transfer  operations  are  summarized,  along  with  the 
types  of  controls  currently  available  for  use  in  the  industry.  In  addition,  an  overview  of 
methods  for  estimating  uncontrolled  and  controlled  emissions  of  benzene  is 
presented  where  available.  Current  Federal  regulations  applicable  to  these  benzene  emission 
sources  are  identified.  The  information  provided  in  this  section  is  applicable  to  benzene 
production  facilities  (discussed  earlier  in  this  chapter)  as  well  as  to  facilities  that  use  benzene 
as  a  feedstock  to  produce  cyclic  intermediates  (discussed  in  Chapter  5.0). 


4-61 


4.5.1 


Process  Vent  Emissions.  Controls,  and  Regulations 


Benzene  emissions  can  occur  from  any  process  vent  in  any  chemical  production 
operation  that  manufactures  or  uses  benzene.  Section  4.0  of  this  document  contains  a 
discussion  of  chemical  operations  that  manufacture  benzene,  whereas  Section  5.0  contains  a 
discussion  of  chemical  operations  that  use  benzene  as  feedstock.  Chemical  operations  that 
emit  benzene  include  air  oxidation  processes,  reactor  processes,  and  distillation  operations. 

In  air  oxidation  processes,  one  or  more  chemicals  are  reacted  with  oxygen  supplied  as  air  or 
air  enriched  with  oxygen  to  create  a  product.  With  reactor  processes,  one  or  more  chemicals 
are  reacted  with  another  chemical  (besides  oxygen)  and  chemically  altered  to  create  one  or 
more  new  products.  In  distillation,  one  or  more  inlet  feed  streams  is  separated  into  two  or 
more  outlet  product  streams,  each  product  stream  having  component  concentrations  different 
from  those  in  the  feed  streams.  During  separation,  the  more  volatile  components  are 
concentrated  in  the  vapor  phase  and  the  less  volatile  components  in  the  liquid  phase.45 

Calculations  for  estimating  emissions  from  any  of  these  three  processes  are 
specific  to  the  type  of  vent  stream  and  the  type  of  control  in  place. 

Two  general  types  of  methods  are  used  for  controlling  benzene  emissions  from 
process  vents:  recovery  devices  and  combustion  devices.  Examples  of  each  type  of  control 
device  that  can  be  used  to  comply  with  air  pollution  control  standards,  along  with  its 
estimated  control  efficiency,  are  summarized  in  Tables  4-10  and  4-1 1  and  discussed  briefly 
below.45  The  reader  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  most  appropriate  recovery  control  device, 
as  well  as  its  effectiveness,  is  highly  dependent  upon  flow  rate,  concentration,  chemical  and 
physical  properties  of  the  vent  stream,  contaminants  present,  and  stream  temperature.  To 
achieve  optimal  control  efficiency  with  recovery  devices,  several  stream  characteristics  must 
remain  within  a  certain  range.  Combustion  control  devices  are  less  dependent  upon  these 
process  and  vent  stream  characteristics;  however,  combustion  temperature  and  stream  flow 
must  remain  within  a  certain  range  to  ensure  complete  combustion.46

4-64 


Three  types  of  recovery  devices  have  been  identified  for  controlling  benzene 
emissions:  condensation,  absorption,  and  adsorption.  With  a  condensation-type  recovery 
device,  all  or  part  of  the  condensible  components  of  the  vapor  phase  are  converted  to  a  liquid 
phase.  Condensation  occurs  as  heat  from  the  vapor  phase  is  transferred  to  a  cooling  medium. 
The  most  common  type  of  condensation  device  is  a  surface  condenser,  where  the  coolant  and 
vapor  phases  are  separated  by  a  tube  wall  and  never  come  in  direct  contact  with  each  other. 
Efficiency  is  dependent  upon  the  type  of  vapor  stream  entering  the  condenser  and  the  flow  rate 
and  temperature  of  the  cooling  medium.  Condenser  efficiency  varies  from  50  to  95  percent. 
Stream  temperature  and  the  organic  concentration  level  in  the  stream  must  remain  within  a 
certain  range  to  ensure  optimal  control  efficiency.46 

In  absorption,  one  or  more  components  of  a  gas  stream  are  selectively  transferred 
to  a  solvent  liquid.  Control  devices  in  this  category  include  spray  towers,  venturi  scrubbers, 
packed  columns,  and  plate  columns.  Absorption  efficiency  is  dependent  upon  the  type  of 
solvent  liquid  used,  as  well  as  design  and  operating  conditions.  Absorption  is  desirable  if  there 
is  a  high  concentration  of  compound  in  the  vent  stream  that  can  be  recovered  for  reuse.  For 
example,  in  the  manufacture  of  monochlorobenzene,  absorbers  are  used  to  recover  benzene  for 
reuse  as  a  feedstock.46  Stream  temperature,  specific  gravity  (the  degree  of  adsorbing  liquid 
saturation),  and  the  organic  concentration  level  must  remain  within  a  certain  range  to  ensure 
optimal  control  efficiency.46  Absorbers  are  generally  not  used  on  streams  with  VOC 
concentrations  below  300  ppmv.45  Control  efficiencies  vary  from  50  to  95  percent.45 

In  adsorption,  the  process  vent  gas  stream  contains  a  component  (adsorbate)  that 
is  captured  on  a  solid-phase  surface  (adsorbent)  by  either  physical  or  chemical  adsorption 
mechanisms.  Carbon  adsorbers  are  the  most  commonly  used  adsorption  method.  With  carbon 
adsorption,  the  organic  vapors  are  attracted  to  and  physically  held  on  granular  activated  carbon 
through  intermolecular  (van  der  Waals)  forces.  The  two  adsorber  designs  are  fixed-bed  and 
fluidized-bed.  Fixed-bed  adsorbers  must  be  regenerated  periodically  to  desorb  the  collected 
organics.  Fluidized-bed  adsorbers  are  continually  regenerated.46 


4-65 


Adsorption  efficiency  can  be  95  percent  for  a  modem,  well-designed  system. 
Removal  efficiency  depends  upon  the  physical  properties  of  the  compounds  in  the  offgas,  the 
gas  stream  characteristics,  and  the  physical  properties  of  the  adsorbent.  Stream  mass  flow 
during  regeneration,  the  temperature  of  the  carbon  bed,  and  organic  concentration  level  in  the 
stream  must  remain  within  a  certain  range  to  ensure  optimal  control  efficiency.46  Adsorbers  are 
not  recommended  for  vent  streams  with  high  VOC  concentrations.45 

Four  types  of  combustion  devices  are  identified  for  control  of  benzene  emissions 
from  process  vents:  flares,  thermal  oxidizers,  boilers  and  process  heaters,  and  catalytic 
oxidizers.  A  combustion  device  chemically  converts  benzene  and  other  organics  to  C02  and 
water.  If  combustion  is  not  complete,  the  organic  may  remain  unaltered  or  be  converted  to 
another  organic  chemical,  called  a  product  of  incomplete  combustion.  Combustion 
temperature  and  stream  flow  must  remain  within  a  certain  range  to  ensure  complete 
combustion.46 


A  flare  is  an  open  combustion  process  that  destroys  organic  emissions  with  a 
high-temperature  oxidation  flame.  The  oxygen  required  for  combustion  is  provided  by  the  air 
around  the  flame.  Good  combustion  is  governed  by  flame  temperature,  residence  time  of  the 
organics  in  the  combustion  zone,  and  turbulent  mixing  of  the  components  to  complete  the 
oxidation  reaction.  There  are  two  main  types  of  flares:  elevated  and  ground  flares.  A 
combustion  efficiency  of  at  least  98  percent  can  be  achieved  with  such  control.46 

A  thermal  oxidizer  is  usually  a  refractory-lined  chamber  containing  a  burner  (or 
set  of  burners)  at  one  end.  The  thermal  oxidation  process  is  influenced  by  residence  time, 
mixing,  and  temperature.  Unlike  a  flare,  a  thermal  oxidizder  operates  continuously  and  is  not 
suited  for  intermittent  streams.  Because  it  operates  continuously,  auxiliary  fuel  must  be  used  to 
maintain  combustion  during  episodes  in  which  the  organic  concentration  in  the  process  vent 
stream  is  below  design  conditions.  Based  on  new  technology,  it  has  been  determined  that  all 
new  thermal  oxidizers  are  capable  of  achieving  at  least  98  percent  destruction  efficiency  or  a  20 
parts  per  million  by  volume  (ppmv)  outlet  concentration,  based  on  operation  at  870°C 
(1 ,600°F)  with  a  0.75-second  residence  time.46 


4-66 


Industrial  boilers  and  process  heaters  can  be  designed  to  control  organics  by 
combining  the  vent  stream  with  the  inlet  fuel  or  by  feeding  the  stream  into  the  boiler  or  stream 
through  a  separate  burner.  An  industrial  boiler  produces  steam  at  high  temperatures.  A 
process  heater  raises  the  temperature  of  the  process  stream  as  well  as  the  superheating  steam  at 
temperatures  usually  lower  than  those  of  an  industrial  boiler.  Greater  than  99  percent  control 
efficiency  is  achievable  with  these  combustion  devices.46 

By  using  catalysts,  combustion  can  occur  at  temperatures  lower  than  those  used  in 
thermal  incineration.  A  catalytic  oxidizer  is  similar  to  a  thermal  incinerator  except  that  it 
incorporates  the  use  of  a  catalyst.  Combustion  catalysts  include  platinum,  platinum  alloys, 
copper  oxide,  chromium,  and  cobalt.  Catalytic  oxidizers  can  achieve  destruction  efficiencies  of 

98  percent  or  greater.46 

Biofiltration  is  another  type  of  VOC  control.  In  biofiltration,  process  exhaust 
gases  are  passed  through  soil  on  compost  beds  containing  micro  organisms,  which  convert 
VOC  to  carbon  dioxide,  water,  and  mineral  salts.47 

Table  4-12  presents  a  comparison  of  the  VOC  control  technologies  (excluding 
combustion)  that  are  discussed  in  this  section.47 

Process  vents  emitting  benzene  and  other  VOC  that  are  discussed  in  Sections  4.1 
through  4.4  and  in  Section  5.0  are  affected  by  one  or  more  of  the  following  six  Federal 
regulations: 

1 .  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Organic  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  from 
the  Synthetic  Organic  Chemical  Manufacturing  Industry,”  promulgated 
April  22,  1994.48 

2.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  from 
Petroleum  Refineries,”  promulgated  August  18,  1995.49

In  general,  for  the  affected  facilities  subject  to  these  six  regulations,  use  of  the  recovery 
devices  and  combustion  devices  discussed  above  is  required.  Tables  4-10  and  4-11  present  a 
summary  of  those  controls  and  the  required  operating  parameters  and  monitoring  ranges  needed 
to  ensure  that  the  required  control  efficiency  is  being  achieved. 


4.5.2  Equipment  Leak  Emissions.  Controls,  and  Regulations 


Equipment  leak  emissions  occur  from  process  equipment  components  whenever 
the  liquid  or  gas  streams  leak  from  the  equipment.  Equipment  leaks  can  occur  from  the 
following  components:  pump  seals,  process  valves,  compressor  seals  and  safety  relief  valves, 
flanges,  open-ended  lines,  and  sampling  connections.  The  following  approaches  for  estimating 
equipment  leak  emissions  are  presented  in  the  EPA  publication  Protocol  for  Equipment  Leak 
Emission  Estimates i54 


Average  emission  factor  approach; 
Screening  ranges  approach; 

EPA  correlation  approach;  and 
Unit-specific  correlation  approach. 


4-70 


The  approaches  differ  in  complexity;  however,  greater  complexity  usually  yields  more  accurate 
emissions  estimates. 

The  simplest  method,  the  average  emission  factor  approach,  requires  that  the 
number  of  each  component  type  be  known.  For  each  component,  the  benzene  content  of  the 
stream  and  the  time  the  component  is  in  service  are  needed.  This  information  is  then 
multiplied  by  the  EPA's  average  emission  factors  for  the  SOCMI  shown  in  Table  4-13.54 
Refinery  average  emission  factors  are  shown  in  Table  4-14;  marketing  terminal  average 
emission  factors  are  shown  in  Table  4-15;  and  oil  and  gas  production  average  emission  factors 
are  shown  in  Table  4- 16. 54  This  method  is  an  improvement  on  using  generic  emissions 
developed  from  source  test  data,  inventory  data,  and/or  engineering  judgement.  However,  this 
method  should  only  be  used  if  no  other  data  are  available  because  it  may  result  in  an 
overestimation  or  underestimation  of  actual  equipment  leak  emissions.  For  each  component, 
estimated  emissions  are  calculated  as  follows: 

No.  of 
equipment 
components 

To  obtain  more  accurate  equipment  leak  emission  estimates,  one  of  the  more 
complex  estimation  approaches  should  be  used.  These  approaches  require  that  some  level  of 
emissions  measurement  for  the  facility’s  equipment  components  be  collected.  These  are 
described  briefly,  and  the  reader  is  referred  to  the  EPA  protocol  document  for  the  calculation 
details.

The  screening  ranges  approach  (formerly  known  as  the  leak/no  leak  approach)  is 
based  on  a  determination  of  the  number  of  leaking  and  non-leaking  components.  This 
approach  may  be  applied  when  screening  data  are  available  as  either  "greater  than  or  equal  to 
10,000  ppmv"  or  as  "less  than  10,000  ppmv."  Emission  factors  for  these  two  ranges  of 
screening  values  are  presented  in  Table  4-17  for  SOCMI  screening;  Table  4-18  for  refinery 
screening,  Table  4-19  for  marketing  terminal  screening,  and  Table  4-20  for  oil  and  gas 
production  screening.54

*  The  emission  factors  presented  in  this  table  for  gas  valves,  light  liquid  valves,  light  liquid  pumps,  and 
connectors  are  revised  SOCMI  average  emission  factors. 
b  These  factors  are  for  total  organic  compound  emission  rates. 

c  The  light  liquid  pump  seal  factor  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  leak  rate  from  agitator  seals. 

The  EPA  correlation  approach  offers  an  additional  refinement  to  estimating 
equipment  leak  emissions  by  providing  an  equation  to  predict  mass  emission  rate  as  a  function 
of  screening  value  for  a  specific  equipment  type.  The  EPA  correlation  approach  is  preferred 
when  actual  screening  values  are  available.  Correlation  operations  for  SOCMI,  refinery, 
marketing  terminals,  and  oil  and  gas  production  along  with  respective  correlation  curves  are 
provided  in  Reference  54. 

The  unit-specific  correlation  approach  requires  the  facility  to  develop  its  own 
correlation  equations  and  requires  more  rigorous  testing,  bagging,  and  analyzing  of  equipment 
leaks  to  determine  mass  emission  rates. 

Appendix  A  of  the  EPA  protocol  document  provides  example  calculations  for 
each  of  the  approaches  described  above.

b  The  light  liquid  pump  seal  factor  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  leak  rate  from  agitator  seals. 

Although  no  specific  information  on  controls  of  fugitive  emissions  used  by  the 
industry  was  identified,  equipment  components  in  benzene  service  will  have  some  controls  in 
place.  Generally,  control  of  fugitive  emissions  will  require  the  use  of  sealless  or  double 
mechanical  seal  pumps  and  an  inspection  and  maintenance  program,  as  well  as  replacement  of 
leaking  valves  and  fittings.  Typical  controls  for  equipment  leaks  are  listed  in  Table  4-21. 55 
Some  leakless  equipment  is  available,  such  as  leakless  valves  and  sealless  pumps.55 

Equipment  leak  emissions  are  regulated  by  the  National  Emission  Standard  for 
Equipment  Leaks  (Fugitive  Emission  Sources)  of  Benzene  promulgated  in  June  6,  1984.56  This 
standard  applies  to  sources  that  are  intended  to  operate  in  benzene  service,  such  as  pumps, 
compressors,  pressure  relief  devices,  sampling  connection  systems,  open-ended  valves  or  lines, 
valves,  flanges  and  other  connectors,  product  accumulator  vessels,  and  control  devices  or 
systems  required  by  this  subpart.

b  The  "other"  equipment  type  should  be  applied  for  any  equipment  type  other  than  fittings,  pumps,  or  valves. 
c  "Fittings"  were  not  identified  as  flanges  or  non-flanged  connectors;  therefore,  the  fitting  emissions  were 
estimated  by  averaging  the  estimates  from  the  connector  and  the  flange  correlation  equations. 

Each  owner  or  operator  subject  to  Subpart  J  shall  comply  with  the  requirement  of 
the  National  Emission  Standard  for  Equipment  Leaks  promulgated  in  June  6,  1984. 57  The 
provisions  of  this  subpart  apply  to  the  same  sources  mentioned  above  that  are  intended  to 
operate  in  volatile  hazardous  air  pollutant  (VHAP)  service.  Benzene  is  a  VHAP. 


The  SOCMI  New  Source  Performance  Standards  promulgated  in 
October  18,  198358  also  apply  to  equipment  leak  emissions.  These  standards  apply  to  VOC 

emissions  af  affected  facilities  that  commenced  construction,  modification,  or  reconstruction 

after  January  5,  1981. 


Equipment  leak  emissions  from  Coke  by-product  recovery  plants  are  regulated 
by  the  National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene  Emissions  from  Coke  By-Product  Recovery 
Plants  promulgated  in  September  14,  1989.53  These  standards  apply  to  the  same  sources 
(equipment  leak  components)  as  indicated  in  Subpart  J,  and  V  of  Part  61.

from  the  point  of  origin  to  the  point  where  the  water  content  reaches  99  percent.  For  water  streams  with  a  water 
content  greater  than  99  percent,  the  emission  rate  is  considered  negligible. 
b  These  factors  are  for  total  organic  compound  emission  rates  (including  non-VOC  such  as  methane  and  ethane) 
and  apply  to  light  crude,  heavy  crude,  gas  plant,  gas  production,  and  off  shore  facilities.  "NA"  indicates  that  not 
enough  data  were  available  to  develop  the  indicated  emission  factor. 
c  The  "other"  equipment  type  was  derived  from  compressors,  diaphrams,  drains,  dump  arms,  hatches,  instruments, 
meters,  pressure  relief  valves,  polished  rods,  relief  valves,  and  vents.  This  "other"  equipment  type  should  be 
applied  for  any  equipment  type  other  than  connectors,  flanges,  open-ended  lines,  pumps,  or  valves.

4.5.3  Storage  Tank  Emissions.  Controls,  and  Regulations 


A  possible  source  of  benzene  emissions  from  chemical  production  operations  that 
produce  or  use  benzene  are  storage  tanks  that  contain  benzene.  Emissions  from  storage  tanks 
include  "working  losses"  and  "breathing  losses."  Working  losses  are  emissions  that  occur 
while  a  tank  is  being  filled  (filling  the  tank  with  liquid  forces  organic  vapors  out  of  the  tank). 
Breathing  losses  are  emissions  that  result  from  expansion  due  to  temperature  changes  (a  higher

ambient  temperature  heats  the  air  inside  the  tank,  causing  the  air  to  expand  and  forcing  organic 
vapors  out  of  the  tank).  The  calculations  to  estimate  working  and  breathing  loss 
emissions  from  storage  tanks  are  complex  and  require  knowledge  of  a  number  of  site-specific 
factors  about  the  storage  tank  for  which  emissions  are  being  estimated.  Equations  for 
estimating  emissions  of  organic  compounds  from  storage  tanks  are  provided  in  the  EPA 
document  entitled  Compilation  of  Air  Pollutant  Emission  Factors  ( AP-42 ),  Chapter  7. 33 


Benzene  emissions  from  storage  tanks  may  be  reduced  with  control  equipment 
and  by  work  practices.  Various  types  of  control  equipment  may  be  used  to  reduce  organic 
emissions,  including  (1)  storing  the  liquid  in  a  storage  tank  with  a  floating  deck  (i.e.,  an 
intemal-floating-roof  tank  or  extemal-floating-roof  tank),  (2)  equipping  floating  decks  with 
additional  devices  to  reduce  emissions  (e.g.,  applying  sealing  mechanisms  around  the  perimeter 
of  the  floating  deck,  welding  the  deck  seams,  installing  gaskets  around  openings  and  in  closure 
devices  on  the  floating  deck),  and  (3)  venting  air  emissions  from  a  fixed-roof  storage  tank  to  a 
control  device  (e.g.,  a  closed-vent  system  and  a  carbon  adsorber,  condenser,  or  flare).  Work

practices  that  reduce  organic  emissions  include  keeping  manholes  and  other  access  doors 
gasketed  and  bolted  unless  in  use. 


The  control  efficiencies  achieved  by  the  various  types  of  control  equipment 
vary.  Storage  tanks  with  internal  or  external  floating  roofs  will  have  varying  emission  control 
efficiencies  depending  on  the  type  of  floating  deck  and  seal  mechanism  used,  as  well  as  various 
other  factors.  The  control  efficiency  achieved  by  closed-vent  systems  and  control  devices  also 
varies,  depending  on  the  type  and  specific  design  of  the  control  device  used.  For  information 
on  the  control  efficiencies  associated  with  specific  control  devices,  refer  to  Tables  4-10  and 
4-11.  The  control  devices  applicable  to  reducing  process  vent  emissions  listed  in  these  tables 
are  also  applicable  to  storage  tanks. 


Storage  tanks  containing  benzene  and  other  organic  compounds  are  regulated  by 
the  four  following  Federal  rules: 


1 .  “National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene  Emissions  from  Benzene 

Storage  Vessels;”61 

2.  “Standards  of  Performance  for  Volatile  Organic  Liquid  Storage  Vessels 
for  which  Construction,  Reconstruction,  or  Modification  Commenced 
after  July  23,  1984;”62 

3.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Organic  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants 
from  the  Synthetic  Organic  Chemical  Manufacturing  Industry  for 
Process  Vents,  Storage  Vessels,  Transfer  Operations,  and 

Wastewater:”63  and 

4.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  from 
Petroleum  Refineries.”49 

In  combination,  these  four  regulations  generally  require  new  and  existing 
facilities  subject  to  the  rules  to  store  benzene  in  an  intemal-floating-roof  storage  tank,  an 
extemal-floating-roof  storage  tank,  or  a  fixed-roof  storage  tank  with  a  closed-vent  system  and 
control  device  that  reduces  emissions  by  95  percent  for  a  new  facility,  or  90  percent  for  an 
existing  facility.  Additionally,  the  four  regulations  include  requirements  for  specific  seal 
mechanisms  and  gaskets  to  be  utilized  on  a  floating  roof,  as  well  as  certain  work  practices.

4.5.4 


Wastewater  Collection  and  Treatment  System  Emissions,  Controls,  and 

Regulations 


A  possible  source  of  benzene  emissions  from  chemical  production  operations 
that  use  benzene  are  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems  that  handle  wastewater 
containing  benzene.  Benzene  emissions  from  wastewater  collection  systems  can  originate  from 
various  types  of  equipment  including  wastewater  tanks,  surface  impoundments,  containers, 
drain  systems,  and  oil-water  separators.  Emissions  also  originate  from  wastewater  treatment 
systems.  Equations  for  estimating  emissions  of  organic  compounds  from  wastewater  collection 
and  treatment  systems  are  provided  in  the  EPA  document  Compilation  of  Air  Pollutant 
Emission  Factors  ( AP-42 ),  Chapter  4.M 

Two  control  strategies  can  be  applied  to  benzene  emissions  from  wastewater. 

The  first  control  strategy  is  waste  minimization  through  process  modifications,  modification  of 
operating  practices,  preventive  maintenance,  recycling,  or  segregation  of  waste  streams.  The 
second  control  strategy  is  to  reduce  the  benzene  content  of  the  wastewater. through  treatment 
before  the  stream  contacts  ambient  air.  A  complete  strategy  for  reducing  the  benzene  content 
of  the  wastewater  includes:  (1)  suppression  of  emissions  from  collection  and  treatment  system 
components  by  hard  piping  or  enclosing  the  existing  wastewater  collection  system  up  to  the 
point  of  treatment,  (2)  treatment  of  the  wastewater  to  remove  benzene,  and  (3)  treatment  of 
residuals.  Residuals  include  oil  phases,  condensates,  and  sludges  from  nondestructive 
treatment  units.65  This  section  will  discuss  the  second  control  strategy  of  reducing  benzene 
emissions  by  suppression  ana  treatment. 

The  benzene  emissions  from  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems  can 
be  controlled  either  by  hard  piping  or  by  enclosing  the  transport  and  handling  system  from  the 
point  of  wastewater  generation  until  the  wastewater  is  treated  to  remove  or  destroy  the  organic 
compounds.  Suppression  techniques  can  be  broken  down  into  four  categories:  collection 
system  controls,  roofs,  floating  membranes,  and  air-supported  structures.  These  techniques  can 
be  applied  to  drain  systems,  tanks,  containers,  surface  impoundments,  and  oil-water  separators. 
Suppression  of  benzene  emissions  merely  keeps  the  organic  compounds  in  the  wastewater  until 


4-82 


they  reach  the  next  potential  benzene  emission  source.  Therefore,  these  techniques  are  not 
effective  unless  the  benzene  emissions  are  suppressed  until  the  wastewater  reaches  a  treatment 
device  where  the  organic  compounds  are  either  removed  or  destroyed.  Also,  work  practices, 
such  as  leak  detection  and  repair,  must  be  used  to  maintain  equipment  effectiveness.65 

Treatment  techniques  that  can  be  used  to  remove  or  destroy  benzene  are  steam 
stripping  and  air  stripping  (removal)  and  biological  treatment  (destruction).  Steam  and  air 
stripping  accomplish  removal  by  stripping  benzene  out  of  the  wastewater  into  a  gas  stream, 
which  must  then  be  controlled  and  vented  to  the  atmosphere.  Biological  treatment  destroys 
benzene  by  using  microorganisms  to  biodegrade  the  benzene  in  the  process  of  energy  and 
biomass  production. 

Add-on  controls  serve  to  reduce  benzene  emissions  by  destroying  or  extracting 
benzene  from  gas  phase  vent  streams  before  it  is  discharged  to  the  atmosphere.  Add-on 
controls  are  applicable  to  vents  associated  with  collection  and  treatment  covers,  such  as  drain 
covers,  fixed  roofs,  and  air-supported  structures,  and  with  organic  compound  removal  devices, 
such  as  air  strippers  and  steam  strippers.  Add-on  controls  for  benzene  emissions  are  classified 
into  four  broad  categories:  adsorption,  combustion,  condensation,  and  absorption.  The  type  of 
add-on  control  best  suited  for  a  particular  wastewater  emission  source  depends  on  the  size  of 
the  source  and  the  characteristics  of  the  wastewater  in  the  source.65 

The  control  efficiencies  associated  with  the  various  types  of  suppression, 
treatment,  and  add-on  control  equipment  vary,  Estimating  the  control  efficiency  of  emissions 
suppression  techniques  for  wastewater  collection  systems  (e.g.,  water  seals,  covers,  floating 
roofs,  and  submerged  fill  pipes)  is  complex,  and  equations  for  estimating  emissions  from  these 
sources  are  not  readily  available.  The  control  efficiency  associated  with  use  of  a  fixed-roof  or 
gasketed  cover  and  a  closed-vent  system  routed  to  a  control  device  would  be  equivalent  to  the 
efficiency  achieved  by  the  control  device.  Refer  to  Tables  4-10  and  4-1 1  for  a  listing  of  control 
devices  applicable  to  wastewater  systems.  Additionally,  the  control  efficiencies  associated 
with  steam  and  air  strippers  and  biological  treatment  units  vary,  depending  on  the  design  of  the 
systems.  Refer  to  the  discussion  below  for  the  specific  control  efficiencies  associated  with 


4-83 


steam  strippers  and  biological  treatment  units  that  would  be  designed  to  comply  with  existing 
Federal  regulations. 

Wastewater  streams  containing  benzene  are  Federally  regulated  by  the  following 

rules: 


1 .  “National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene  Waste  Operations;”66 

2.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Organic  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants 
from  the  Synthetic  Organic  Chemical  Manufacturing  Industry  for 
Process  Vents,  Storage  Vessels,  Transfer  Operations,  and  Wastewater” 
(HON);63  and 

3.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  at 
Petroleum  Refineries.”49 


The  rules  regulate  benzene  emissions  from  wastewater  collection  and  treatment 
systems,  and  apply  to  new  and  existing  facilities.  Chemical  production  processes  subject  to  the 
regulations  would  be  required  to  apply  many  of  the  controls  specified  above  for  both 
wastewater  collection  and  waste  water  treatment  systems. 


The  rules  require  specific  suppression  equipment  (e.g.,  roofs)  and  work 
practices  (e.g.,  leak  detection  and  repair)  rather  than  specifying  a  suppression  control  efficiency 
that  must  be  achieved.  For  add-on  control  devices  (e.g.,  incinerators,  adsorbers)  to  destroy 
organics  vented  from  collection  and  treatment  equipment,  both  rules  require  95  percent 

efficiency. 


For  treatment,  the  National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene  Waste  Operations66 
and  the  National  Petroleum  Refinery  NESHAP49  do  not  require  specific  treatment  equipment. 
Instead,  the  rule  requires  the  treatment  process  to  achieve  either  removal  or  destruction  of 
benzene  in  the  waste  system  by  99  percent,  or  removal  of  benzene  to  less  than  10  parts  per 
million  by  weight  (ppmw).  However,  the  technology  basis  for  the  99  percent  efficiency 
standard  is  steam  stripping.

The  HON  offers  several  different  wastewater  treatment  compliance  options. 
These  options  include  concentration-based  limits,  pollutant  reduction  percentages,  and  an 
equipment  standard.  The  equipment  standard  is  a  steam  stripper  with  specific  design  criteria 
that  would  result  in  a  99  percent  reduction  in  benzene  emissions.  The  HON  also  allows 
facilities  to  comply  with  the  treatment  standard  by  using  biological  treatment  units  that  achieve 
a  95  percent  reduction  of  total  organic  hazardous  air  pollutants  in  the  wastewater.  (Benzene  is 
one  of  the  hazardous  air  pollutants). 

4.5.5  Product  Loading  and  Transport  Operations  Emissions.  Controls,  and 

Regulations 

Although  pipeline  transfer  of  raw  materials  and  products  is  widely  used  in  the 
different  industries,  shipment  by  tank  cars,  tank  trucks,  ships,  and  barges  is  also  common.  The 
product  loading  and  transportation  of  chemicals  and  petroleum  liquids  represent  potential 
sources  of  evaporation  losses. 

Emissions  from  the  above  sources  are  due  to  loading  losses,  ballasting  losses, 
and  transit  losses.  Refer  to  Section  6.3  (Gasoline  Marketing)  of  this  document  for  information 
on  emission  factors  and  equations  to  estimate  emissions  from  loading  and  transport  operations, 
as  well  as  information  on  control  technology. 

The  HON  regulates  organic  hazardous  air  pollutants  (HAP)  emissions  from 
proauci  loading  ana  transport  operations/0*1  The  National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene 
Emissions  from  Benzene  Transfer  Operations  also  regulates  benzene  transfer  emissions.67

SECTION  5.0 

EMISSIONS  FROM  MAJOR  USES  OF  BENZENE 


The  largest  portion  of  benzene  produced  is  used  in  the  production  of 
ethylbenzene/styrene.  Other  major  chemicals  for  which  benzene  is  used  as  a  feedstock  include 
cyclohexane,  cumene,  phenol,  nitrobenzene,  and  linear  alkylbenzene.  For  each  of  these 
emission  sources,  the  following  information  is  provided  in  the  sections  below':  (1)  a  brief 
characterization  of  the  national  activity  in  the  United  States,  (2)  a  process  description, 

(3)  benzene  emissions  characteristics,  and  (4)  control  technologies  and  techniques  for  reducing 
benzene  emissions.  In  some  cases,  the  current  Federal  regulations  applicable  to  the  source 
category  are  discussed. 

Emission  factors  are  presented,  as  available.  The  reader  is  advised  to  contact 
the  specific  source  in  question  to  verify  the  nature  of  the  process,  production  volume,  and 
control  techniques  used  before  applying  any  of  the  emission  factors  presented  in  this  report. 

Other  minor  chemicals  where  benzene  is  used  as  a  feedstock  include  resorcinol 

benzophenone,  hydroquinone,  anthraquinone,  biphenyl,  and  benzene  sulfonic  acid.68  These 
chemical  processes  are  discussed  briefly  in  this  section.  Although  benzene  has  been  used  in  the 
past  as  a  feedstock  in  the  production  of  maleic  anhydride,  all  capacity  for  producing  maleic 
anhydride  in  the  United  States  is  now  n-butane  based;  therefore,  the  process  for  producing 
maleic  anhydride  from  benzene  is  not  included  in  this  section.

ETHYLBENZENE  AND  STYRENE  PRODUCTION 


Ethylbenzene  is  a  liquid  at  standard  conditions,  with  a  boiling  point  of  277  °F 
(136 °C)  and  a  vapor  pressure  of  1,284  Pa  (0.0126  atm).69  About  50  percent  of  the  U.S. 
production  of  benzene  is  used  to  produce  ethylbenzene.  The  ethylbenzene  industry  is  closely 
tied  to  the  styrene  industry  because  styrene  is  produced  exclusively  from  ethylbenzene.  There 
can  be  approximately  a  0.3  percent  by  weight  carry-over  of  benzene  into  ethylbenzene  and 
styrene.9  Additionally,  some  benzene  is  reformed  in  the  production  of  styrene.  Ethylbenzene 
production  processes  and  uses  thereby  constitute  a  major  potential  source  of  benzene 
emissions,  particularly  because  styrene  production  is  anticipated  to  experience  continued 
growth.  Ethylbenzene  demand  is  expected  to  show  growth  of  only  2.5  to  3.5  percent  per  year 
over  the  next  several  years.70 

Ethylbenzene  is  used  almost  exclusively  to  produce  styrene.  Some  ethylbenzene 
is  used  as  a  solvent  (often  replacing  xylene)  and  in  the  production  of  some  dyes.71  Total 
ethylbenzene  production  capacity  is  currently  13,874  million  pounds  per  year  (lb/yr)  (6,293 
kg/yr).11  Approximately  95  percent  of  this  capacity  is  based  on  benzene  alkylation,  with  the 
remainder  based  on  extraction  from  mixed  xylene  streams.  Most  styrene  is  produced  by  two 
methods:  hydrogenation  of  ethylbenzene  (89  percent)  and  peroxidation  of  ethylbenzene  with 
subsequent  hydration  (11  percent).  The  latter  process  can  also  co-produce  propylene  oxide.  A 
third  process,  converting  ethylbenzene  isothermally  to  styrene,  was  developed  in  Europe.  To 
date,  no  U.S.  facilities  report  using  this  method. 

Another  method  that  co-produces  both  ethylbenzene  and  styrene  has  been 
patented.72  In  this  process,  toluene  and  light  alkanes  other  than  ethane  are  reacted  at  1,832  to 
2,192  °F  (1,000  to  1,200°C)  and  then  gradually  cooled  to  produce  an  80  percent 
ethylbenzene/ 12  percent  styrene  product  with  a  mass  of  about  25  percent  by  weight  of  the 
toluene  reactant.  These  products  can  be  separated  by  distillation,  and  the  ethylbenzene  either 
recycled,  sold,  or  converted  to  styrene  by  another  process-dehydrogenation  or  peroxidation. 
This  process  is  not  reported  to  be  in  use  at  this  time. 


5-2 


Table  5-1  lists  U.S.  producers  of  ethylbenzene  and  styrene. 11,69,73  Most  facilities 
produce  both  ethylbenzene  and  styrene  on  site,  thus  reducing  shipping  and  storage.  Only  one 
styrene  production  site  does  not  have  ethylbenzene  production  capacity.  Four  ethylbenzene 
production  sites  do  not  have  styrene  production  capacity.  Ethylbenzene  from  mixed  xylene 
separation  is  generally  shipped  or  supplemented  with  another  ethylbenzene  source  for  styrene 
production.  Only  one  site  uses  the  peroxidation  process  to  produce  styrene.  Table  5-1  also 
gives  the  latest  facility  capacity. 

5.1.1  Process  Description  for  Ethylbenzene  and  Stvrene  Production  Using  Benzene 

Alkylation  and  Ethylbenzene  Dehydrogenation 

Most  ethylbenzene  production  is  integrated  with  the  dehydrogenation  process  to 
produce  styrene;  therefore,  these  processes  are  described  together.  The  primary  reactions  are 
(1)  catalytic  alkylation  of  benzene  with  ethylene  to  produce  ethylbenzene,  and  (2)  catalytic 
dehydrogenation  of  ethylbenzene  to  produce  styrene. 

A  process  flow  diagram  including  the  basic  operations  that  may  be  used  in  the 
production  of  ethylbenzene  by  benzene  alkylation  with  ethylene  is  shown  in  Figure  5-1. 14,74 

The  first  step  in  the  process  is  the  drying  of  benzene  to  remove  water  from  both 
feed  and  recycled  benzene.  An  emission  source  in  this  process  is  the  vent  from  the  benzene 
drying  column  (Vent  B).69 

The  dry  benzene  (Stream  1)  is  fed  to  the  alkylation  reactor  along  with  ethylene, 
aluminum  chloride  catalyst,  and  recycled  polyethylbenzenes.  The  reactor  effluent  (Stream  2) 
goes  to  a  settler,  where  crude  ethylbenzene  is  decanted  and  the  heavy  catalyst-complex  layer  is 
recycled  to  the  reactor.  Any  inert  gases  fed  with  the  ethylene  or  produced  in  the  alkylation 
reactor,  along  with  some  unreacted  benzene,  other  organics,  and  hydrogen  chloride,  are 
exhausted  from  the  reactor  or  from  the  treating  section  (Vent  A).  Reactor  vent  gas  is  generally 
routed  through  a  condenser  and  scrubbers  in  the  alkylation  reaction  section  (not  shown  on  the

The  crude  ethylbenzene  (Stream  3)  from  the  settler  is  washed  with  water  and 
caustic  to  remove  traces  of  chlorides  and  then  fed  to  the  ethylbenzene  purification  section.  The 
crude  ethylbenzene  contains  40  to  55  percent  benzene,  10  to  20  percent  poly  ethylbenzene 
(PEB),  and  high-boiling  point  materials.  The  first  step  in  purification  is  separation  of  recycled 
benzene  (Stream  4)  from  the  crude  ethylbenzene  in  the  benzene  recovery  column.  In  the 
second  step,  the  product  ethylbenzene  (Stream  5)  is  separated  from  the  heavier  hydrocarbons  in 
the  ethylbenzene  recovery  column.  The  heavier  hydrocarbons  are  distilled  in  the 
polyethylbenzene  column  to  separate  the  polyethylbenzenes,  which  are  recycled  (Stream  7), 
from  the  residue  oil.69  Emission  points  in  the  purification  section  include  vents  from  the 
benzene  and  ethylbenzene  recovery  columns  (Vent  C  and  D,  respectively)  and  the 
poly  ethylbenzene  column  (Vent  E).69 

Fresh  ethylbenzene  (Stream  6)  from  the  ethylbenzene  purification  section  is 
combined  with  recycled  ethylbenzene  (Stream  8)  from  the  styrene  purification  section  at  the 
integrated  styrene  plant  and  is  stored  for  use  as  an  intermediate  for  making  styrene.69  Other

Ethylbenzene  Dehydrogenation 


The  hydrogen-rich  process  gas  is  recovered  and  used  as  a  fuel  (Stream  7)  and 
the  process  water  is  purified  in  a  stripper  and  recycled  to  the  boiler.  The  remaining  crude 
styrene  liquid  (Stream  6)  goes  to  a  storage  tank.  Benzene  and  toluene  (Stream  8)  are  removed 
from  the  crude  styrene  in  the  benzene/toluene  column.  They  are  then  typically  separated  by 
distillation.  The  toluene  is  sold  and  the  benzene  is  returned  to  ethylbenzene  production  section 
(Stream  10),  or  it  may  also  be  sold.  Next,  the  ethylbenzene  column  removes  ethylbenzene, 
which  is  directly  recycled  (Stream  1).  Tars  are  removed  and  the  product  styrene  (Stream  9) 
emerges  from  the  styrene  finishing  column.  In  some  facilities,  an 

ethylbenzene/benzene/toluene  stream  is  separated  from  the  crude  styrene  initially  and  then 
processed  separately. 


Emission  points  in  this  process  include  vents  from  the  columns  for  the  styrene 
purification  section  between  the  separator  and  the  recovery  sections.  These  include  the 
benzene  toluene  column  (Vent  A),  the  ethylbenzene  recycle  column  (Vent  B)  and  the 
emergency  vent  in  the  styrene  finishing  column  (Vent  C).  Other  emission  points  from  the 
process  including  storage  tanks  and  barge  loading  are  shown  in  Figure  5-2'. 

5.1.2  Process  Description  for  Ethylbenzene  Production  from  Mixed  Xylenes 


Ethylbenzene  can  also  be  extracted  from  mixed  xylene  streams. 

Proportionately,  however,  very  little  ethylbenzene  is  produced  in  this  fashion.  The  two  major 
sources  of  ethylbenzene  containing  xylenes  are  catalytic  reformate  from  refineries,  and 

pyrolysis  gasoline  from  ethylene  production  (see  process  description  for  ethylene  production  in 
Section  4.3).  The  amount  of  ethylbenzene  available  is  dependent  on  upstream  production 
variables.  The  ethylene  separation  occurs  downstream  of  the  benzene  production.  For  this 
reason,  the  ethylbenzene  produced  by  this  process  is  not  considered  a  source  of  benzene 
emissions.  Instead,  benzene  emissions  from  the  entire  process  train  are  considered  to  be 
emissions  from  benzene  production  and  are  included  elsewhere  in  this  document  (Section  4.0). 


5-9 


When  combined  with  the  dehydrogenation  process  previously  described  to 
produce  styrene  (Figure  5-2),  the  process  is  similar  except  that  the  benzene  recycling 
(Stream  10  in  Figure  5-2)  cannot  be  reused  directly. 

5.1.3  Process  Description  for  Styrene  Production  from  Ethylbenzene 

Hvdroperoxidation 

Presently,  only  one  U.S.  facility  uses  the  hydroperoxidation  process  to  produce 
styrene.  Figure  5-3  shows  a  process  flow  diagram.  The  four  major  steps  are  described  below. 

Ethylbenzene  (Stream  1)  is  oxidized  with  air  to  produce  ethylene  hydroperoxide 
(Stream  2)  and  small  amounts  of  a-methyl-benzyl  alcohol  and  acetophenone.  The  exit  gas 
(principally  nitrogen)  is  cooled  and  scrubbed  to  recover  aromatics  before  venting.  Unreacted 
ethylbenzene  and  low-boiling  contaminants  are  removed  in  an  evaporator.  Ethylbenzene  is 
then  sent  to  the  recovery  section  to  be  treated  before  reuse. 

Ethylbenzene  hydroperoxide  (Stream  3)  is  combined  with  propylene  over  a 
catalyst  mixture  and  high  pressures  to  produce  propylene  oxide  and  acetophenone.  Pressure  is 
then  reduced  and  residual  propylene  and  other  low-boiling  compounds  (Stream  4)  are  separated 
by  distillation.  The  vent  stream  containing  propane  and  some  propylene  can  be  used  as  a  fuel. 
Propylene  is  recycled  to  the  epoxidation  reactor.  The  crude  epoxidate  (Stream  5)  is  treated  to 
remove  acidic  impurities  and  residual  catalyst  material  and  the  resultant  epoxidate  stream  is 
distilled  to  separate  the  propylene  oxide  product  for  storage. 

Residual  water  and  propylene  are  recycled  to  the  process  train  and  liquid 
distillate  is  recovered  as  a  fuel.  The  organic  layer  is  routed  (Stream  6)  to  the  ethylbenzene  and 
a-methyl-benzyl  alcohol  recovery  section.  Distillation  removes  any  remaining  ethylbenzene. 
Organic  waste  streams  are  separated  from  the  a-methyl-benzyl  alcohol  and  acetophenone 
organic  waste  liquids  are  used  as  fuel.

The  mixed  stream  of  a-methyl-benzyl  alcohol  and  acetophenone  (Stream  7)  is 
then  dehydrated  over  a  solid  catalyst  to  produce  styrene.  Residual  catalyst  solids  and 
high-boiling  impurities  are  separated  and  collected  for  disposal.  The  crude  styrene  goes  to  a 
series  of  distillation  columns,  where  the  pure  styrene  monomer  product  is  recovered.  The 
residual  organic  stream  contains  crude  acetophenone,  catalyst  residue,  and  various  impurities. 
This  mixture  is  treated  under  pressure  with  hydrogen  gas  to  convert  the  acetophenone  to 
a-methyl-benzyl  alcohol.  Catalyst  waste  is  separated  from  the  a-methyl-benzyl  alcohol,  which 
is  returned  to  the  recovery  section  for  processing  and  reuse.  Hydrogen  and  organic  vapors  are 
recovered  for  use  as  fuel. 

5.1.4  Process  Description  for  Stvrene  Production  bv  an  Isothermal  Process 

Ethylbenzene  may  also  be  converted  to  styrene  by  an  isothermal  process 
(Figure  5-4).  Liquid  ethylbenzene  is  vaporized  by  condensing  steam  in  a  heat  exchanger 
(Stream  1).  Process  steam  (Stream  2)  is  then  introduced  into  the  ethylbenzene  stream  and  the 
feed  mixture  is  superheated  (Stream  3)  before  it  enters  the  molten-salt  reactor  (Stream  4) 

(see  Figure  5-4). 75 

In  the  reactor,  the  ethylbenzene/steam  mixture  passes  through  the  tubes,  where 
it  comes  into  contact  with  the  catalyst  and  is  dehydrogenated.  Heat  for  the  dehydrogenation 
reaction  is  supplied  by  molten  salt  (preferably  a  mixture  of  sodium  carbonate,  lithium 
carbonate,  and  potassium  carbonate)  surrounding  the  tubes  (Stream  5).  The  reactor  is 
maintained  at  a  uniform  wall  temperature  by  circulating  the  molten-salt  mixture  through  the 
heat  exchanger  of  a  fired  heater  (Stream  6). 75 

The  reaction  products  are  cooled  and  condensed  in  a  separator  (Stream  7).  The 
liquid  phase  is  a  mixture  of  organic  products:  styrene,  unreacted  ethylbenzene,  and  small 
quantities  of  benzene,  toluene,  and  high-boiling  compounds.  Styrene  (Stream  8)  is  separated 
from  the  other  liquid  constituents,  which  then  are  recovered  and  recycled.75

The  gas  phase  from  the  condensation  step  in  the  separator  consists  mainly  of 
hydrogen,  with  small  quantities  of  C02,  CO,  and  methane.-  After  these  gases  are  compressed, 
they  are  cooled.  Condensible  products  from  this  fmal  cooling  stage  are  then  recovered  and 
recycled  to  the  separator.  When  hydrogen-rich  offgas  is  used  as  fuel  for  the  heater  of  the 
molten-salt  reactor,  the  fuel  requirement  for  this  stage  of  the  process  is  zero.75 

5.1.5  Benzene  Emissions  from  Ethylbenzene  and  Stvrene  Production  via  Alkylation 

and  Dehydrogenation 

Emission  Estimates  from  Ethylbenzene  Production  and  Dehydrogenation  to 
Styrene 

Emission  factors  have  been  developed  based  on  an  uncontrolled  300-million- 
kg/yr  capacity  integrated  ethylbenzene/styrene  production  plant.  Major  process  emission 
sources  are  the  alkylation  reactor  area  vents  (Vent  A  in  Figure  5-1).  atmospheric  and  pressure 
column  vents  (Vents  B,  C,  and  D  in  Figure  5-1),  vacuum  column  vents  (Vent  B  in  Figure  5-2), 
and  the  hydrogen  separation  vent  (Stream  7  in  Figure  5-2).  Emission  factors  from  these 
sources  are  given  in  Table  5-2. 69,74  The  first  four  process  vent  streams  in  Table  5-2  are  low- 
flow,  high-concentration  streams.  The  hydrogen  separation  stream  (Stream  7  in  Figure  5-2)  is 
high-flow,  low-concentration.  Other  emission  sources  listed  in  Table  5-2  include  storage 
losses  and  shipment  losses  (Vent  G).  Fugitive  emissions  from  valves  and  other  equipment 
leaks  are  not  indicated  in  Figure  5-1  or  5-2. 

Reactor  area  vents  remove  various  inerts  plus  entrained  aromatics  (benzene). 
Inerts  include  nitrogen  or  methane  used  in  pressure  control,  unreacted  ethylene,  reaction 
byproducts,  and  ethylene  feed  impurities.  In  typical  plants  using  liquid-phase  aluminum 
chloride  catalyst  with  high-purity  ethylene,  vent  streams  are  usually  cooled  and  scrubbed  to 
recover  aromatics.  In  plants  using  the  newer  solid  support  catalysts  of  the  UOP  or 
Mobil/Badger  process,  reactor  vent  flow  rates  are  very  high  because  of  the  low-purity  ethylene 
feed.  Process  economics  requires  that  these  vent  gases  be  burned  as  fuel.

Atmospheric  and  column  vents  remove  non-combustibles  in  the  column  feeds, 
light  aliphatic  hydrocarbons,  and  any  entrained  aromatics.  The  benzene  drying  column  also 
removes  impurities  in  the  benzene  feed.  Most  emissions  occur  in  the  first  column  of  the 
distillation  train  (benzene  recovery  column  in  Figure  5-1). 

Vacuum  column  vents  remove  air  that  leaks  into  the  column,  light  hydrocarbons 
and  hydrogen  formed  in  dehydrogenation,  non-combustibles  in  the  column  feed,  and  entrained 
aromatics.  Most  emissions  occur  on  the  benzene/toluene  column  (vent  A  in  Figure  5-2). 
Uncontrolled  distillation  vents  emit  4.2xl0'3  lb  hydrocarbons/lb  styrene  (4.2xl0'3  kg 
hydrocarbons/kg  styrene)  in  one  plant  where  the  hydrocarbons  are  benzene  and  toluene. 
Another  condenser  controlled  vent  emits  0.4x1  O'3  lb  benzene/lb  styrene  (0.4x1  O'3  kg 
benzene/kg  styrene).9 

Following  dehydrogenation,  a  hydrogen-rich  gas  (Stream  4  in  Figure  5-2) 
containing  methane,  ethane,  ethylene,  C02,  CO,  and  aromatics  is  normally  cooled  and 
compressed  to  recover  aromatics.  The  stream  should  be  vented  to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  E  in 
Figure  5-2)  only  during  startup,  shutdown,  and  recovery  section  compressor  outages.  Some 
plants  may  also  vent  this  stream  to  a  flare.  Flares  are  an  efficient  (99  percent)  emission  control 
only  when  flare  diameter  and  gas  flow  are  closely  matched  for  optimum  turbulence  and 
mixing.  Emissions  can  be  better  controlled  when  the  stream  is  routed  to  a  manifold  and 
burned  with  other  fuels. 

Stripper  vents  have  been  reported  to  emit  0.032  lb  ethylbenzene/lb  styrene  (32  g 
ethylbenzene/kg  styrene).9  This  corresponds  to  9. 6x1  O'6  lb  benzene/lb  styrene  (9. 6x1  O'3  g 
benzene/kg  styrene).  Benzene  in  shipping  and  storage  (Vent  F  in  Figure  5-1)  must  also  be 
considered  as  a  source  if  benzene  is  not  produced  on  site  (in  which  case  these  emissions  would 
be  considered  pan  of  the  benzene  production  process). 


5-17 


Benzene  Emissions  from  Styrene  Production  Using  Ethylbenzene 
Hydroperoxidation 

Only  one  U.S.  facility  currently  reports  using  this  method.  Emission  estimates 
presented  in  this  section  are  based  on  a  capacity  of  1200  million  lb  styrene/yr  (544  million  kg 
styrene/yr). 


The  three  main  process  emission  sources  are  the  ethylbenzene  oxidation  reactor 
vent  (A  in  Figure  5-3),  the  propylene  recycle  purge  vent  (B),  and  the  vacuum  column  vents  (C) 
and  (D).  Propane  vapor  (B)  is  considered  a  fuel  if  it  is  not  vented  to  the  atmosphere.  Of  these 
sources,  only  the  vacuum  vents  are  large  benzene  emitters.  These  emissions  result  from 
benzene  impurities  in  the  ethylbenzene  feed,  which  may  result  in  minor  side  reactions  in  the 
process  train. 


The  ethylbenzene  oxidation  reactor  vent  (A)  releases  CO,  light  organics, 
entrained  aromatics  with  nitrogen,  oxygen,  and  C02.  The  vent  gas  is  scrubbed  with  oil  and 
water  for  a  99  percent  removal  efficiency  for  organics.  The  resulting  vent  stream  contains 
approximately  35  ppm  benzene  (0.11  mg  benzene/1)  or  15.9  lb  benzene/hr  (7.2  kilograms 
benzene  per  hour  [kg/hr]).74 

The  propylene  recycle  vent  (B)  releases  propane,  propylene,  ethane,  and  other 
impurities.  No  flow  volume  data  are  available  but,  based  on  a  similar  procedure  in  high-grade 
propylene  production,  this  stream  is  a  high-Btu  gas  and  would  be  used  as  a  fuel.  No 
significant  benzene  emissions  are  expected.74 

The  ethylbenzene  hydroperoxidation  process  contains  numerous  vacuum 
columns  and  evaporators.  Vents  on  these  operations  (C-l  to  C-3)  release  inerts  and  light 
organics  dissolved  in  the  column  feeds,  nitrogen  used  for  process  pressure  control,  and 
entrained  aromatics.  A  combined  vent  flow  is  reported  to  be  264,200  gal/hr  (l.OxlO6 1/hr) 
containing  about  60  lbs  benzene/hr  (27  kg  benzene/hr).74 


5-18 


The  dehydrogenation  vent  (D  in  Figure  5-3)  may  be  an  emergency  pressure  vent 
similar  to  the  separation  vent  (C  in  Figure  5-2).  No  specific  information  is  available  on 
storage,  transport,  or  fugitive  emissions  for  this  process. 

5.1.6  Control  Technology  for  Ethvlbenzene/Stvrene  Processes 

Control  methods  for  the  two  ethylbenzene/styrene  processes  in  use  in  the  United 
States  include  condensation,  adsorption,  flaring,  and  combustion  in  boilers  or  other  process 
heaters.  Controls  for  fugitive  emissions  from  storage  tanks,  equipment  leaks,  and  others 
include  the  use  of  floating-roof  tanks  and  leak  detection/correction  programs.  No  information 
is  available  on  control  methods  specific  to  the  two  processes  mentioned  in  this  report  but  not  in 
use  in  the  United  States. 

Condensers  may  be  used  to  control  benzene  emissions  associated  with 
ethylbenzene/styrene  production.  The  control  efficiency  of  a  condenser  is  determined  by  the 
temperature  and  pressure  at  which  the  condenser  operates  and  by  the  concentration  and  vapor 
pressure  of  the  organics  in  the  vent  stream.  At  typical  pressures  of  1  to  3  atmospheres  and  coil 
temperatures  of  36  to  41  °F  (2  to  5°C),  condensers  can  achieve  80  to  90  percent  benzene 
reduction  when  used  on  vent  streams  at  70  to  100  percent  saturation  in  benzene  at  104  to 
122  °F  (40  to  50°C).74  Higher  efficiencies  become  prohibitively  expensive. 

Condensers  have  limited  use  in  handling  high-volume  streams,  short  duration 
emergency  releases,  or  cyclic  releases  such  as  from  the  hydrogen  separation  vent. 

Furthermore,  condensers  are  inefficient  at  low  saturations  such  as  with  the  alkylation  reactor 
vents  and  the  column  vents  of  Figure  5-1. 

In  an  ethylbenzene/styrene  plant,  a  packed  tower  can  be  used  to  remove 
benzene.  PEB  and  various  ethylbenzene  produced  during  benzene  alkylation  are  good 
absorbers  of  benzene  and  are  normally  recycled.  This  system  is  unsuitable,  however,  for 
handling  high-volume  or  intermittent  releases  of  gases  beyond  the  tower  design  capabilities. 


5-19 


Absorption  systems  can  maintain  80  to  99  percent  benzene  removal  efficiencies  for  both 
saturated  and  unsaturated  benzene  streams,  depending  on  the  tower  design  and  operating 
variables. 

Flare  systems  can  control  some  streams  for  which  condensation  or  absorption  is 
not  suitable.  Flares  can  efficiently  handle  highly  saturated  streams  such  as  ffom  the  alkylation 
vents.  They  can  also  control  upset  releases  and  other  irregular  releases,  although  efficiency 
can  be  variable.  The  major  difficulty  here  occurs  in  manifolding.  High-nitrogen  or  other  low- 
or  non-combustible  gases  may  also  be  problematic.  Consequently,  there  are  no  conclusive  data 
on  flare  efficiency.  Limited  data  show  benzene  destruction  efficiencies  ranging  from  60  to 
99  percent.  A  properly  designed  flare  system  must  account  for  a  range  of  flow  and  gas 
composition  as  well  as  the  potential  for  explosion. 

Use  of  vent  gases  as  a  fuel  combined  with  regular  process  fuel  is  advantageous 
because  vent  flow  variations  can  be  better  accounted  for.  Also,  better  gas/air  mixing  occurs 
along  the  entire  flare  front.  As  with  flares,  however,  manifolding  to  ensure  optimal 
combustion  characteristics  is  the  major  technical  problem.  Process  pressure  variations  and  the 
possibility  of  emergency  releases  are  complicating  factors. 

5.2  CYCLOHEXANE  PRODUCTION 

About  15  percent  of  the  U.S.  supply  of  benzene  is  used  to  produce 
cyclohexane.10  Table  5-3  lists  the  location  and  current  capacity  for  U.S.  cyclohexane 
producers.11  Two  basic  methods  are  used  to  produce  cyclohexane:  hydrogenation  of  benzene 
and  petroleum  liquid  separation.  Most  of  the  cyclohexane  produced  domestically  is  produced 
through  hydrogenation  of  benzene.  The  following  discussions  of  these  two  processes  are  taken 
from  Reference  76.

Note:  This  list  is  subject  to  change  as  market  conditions  change,  facility  ownership  changes,  plants  are  closed, 
etc.  The  reader  should  verify  the  existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  lists  and/or  the 
plants  themselves.  The  level  of  benzene  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of  variables  such 
as  capacity,  throughput  and  control  measures,  and  should  be  determined  through  direct  contacts  with  plant 
personnel.  These  plant  locations  and  capacities  were  current  as  of  January  1,  1993. 

5.2.1  Process  Description  for  Cyclohexane  Production  via  Benzene  Hydrogenation 

Figure  5-5  shows  a  model  flow  diagram  for  the  manufacture  of  cyclohexane  by 
benzene  hydrogenation.76  High-purity  benzene  (Stream  1)  is  fed  to  the  catalytic  reactors  in 
parallel  and  hydrogen  (Stream  2)  is  fed  into  the  reactors  in  series.  Part  of  the  cyclohexane 

separated  in  the  flash  separator  is  recycled  (Stream  3)  and  fed  to  the  reactors  in  series. 
Recycling  helps  to  control  the  reactor  temperature,  because  the  reaction  is  highly  exothermic. 
The  temperature  is  also  controlled  by  generating  steam,  which  is  used  elsewhere  in  the 
petrochemical  complex.  Both  platinum  and  nickel  catalysts  are  used  presently  to  produce 
cyclohexane.

Figure  5-5.  Process  Flow  Diagram  for  Cyclohexane  Production  Using  the  Benzene 

Hydrogenation  Process 


After  leaving  the  flash  separator,  the  cyclohexane  (Stream  4)  is  sent  to  a 
distillation  column  (stabilizer)  for  removal  of  methane,  ethane,  other  light  hydrocarbons,  and 
soluble  hydrogen  gas  from  the  cyclohexane  product.  These  impurities  (Stream  6)  are  routed  to 
the  fuel-gas  storage  system  for  the  facility  and  used  as  fuel  in  process  heaters.  Cyclohexane 
(Stream  5)  purified  in  the  stabilizer  may  be  greater  than  99.9  percent  pure.  The  residual 
benzene  content  is  typically  less  than  0.0042  lb/gal  (500  mg/1).  This  pure  product  is  stored  in 
'  large  tanks  prior  to  shipment. 

Gas  from  the  flash  separator,  largely  hydrogen,  is  not  pure  enough  for  direct 
reuse.  Therefore,  the  stream  (8)  is  purified  before  being  recycled  to  (Stream  2)  the  reactor. 
Typical  processes  used  for  hydrogen  purification  are  absorption  and  stripping  of  the  hydrogen 
gas  and  cryogenic  separation.  Some  plants  use  a  combination  of  the  two  processes.  Organic 
liquids  (Stream  10)  that  are  separated  from  the  hydrogen  in  the  hydrogen  purification  unit  are 
sent  to  other  petroleum  processing  units  in  the  petrochemical  complex.  The  separated  gases 
(Stream  9)  are  used  as  fuel  gas. 

Depending  on  the  type  of  hydrogen  purification  used,  inert  impurities  present  in 
the  gas  from  the  flash  separator  can  be  purged  from  the  system  before  the  gas  enters  the 
hydrogen  purification  equipment.  This  stream  (7)  is  sent  to  the  fuel  gas  system. 

5.2.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Cyclohexane  Production  via  Benzene  Hydrogenation 

There  are  no  process  emissions  during  normal  operation.76  During  shutdowns, 
individual  equipment  vents  are  opened  as  required  during  final  depressurization  of  equipment. 
Except  for  the  feed  streams,  the  concentration  of  benzene  in  the  process  equipment  is  low; 
therefore,  few  or  no  benzene  emissions  would  be  expected  during  a  shutdown.76 

Equipment  leak  emissions  from  process  pumps,  valves,  and  compressors  may 
contain  benzene  or  other  hydrocarbons.  Storage  of  benzene  (Vent  A  in  Figure  5-5)  may  also 
contribute  to  benzene  emissions. 


5-23 


Other  potential  sources  of  emissions  are  catalyst  handling  (B)  and  absorber 
wastewater  (C)  (when  an  aqueous  solution  is  used  to  purify  the  recycled  hydrogen).  Caution  is 
taken  to  remove  the  organic  compounds  from  the  spent  catalyst  before  it  is  replaced.  The 
spent  catalyst  is  sold  for  metal  recovery.76 

5.2.3  Process  Description  for  Cyclohexane  Production  via  Separation  of  Petroleum 

Fractions 

Cyclohexane  may  also  be  produced  by  separation  of  select  petroleum  fractions. 
The  process  used  to  recover  cyclohexane  in  this  manner  is  shown  in  Figure  5-6. 76  A  petroleum 
fraction  rich  in  cyclohexane  (Stream  1)  is  fed  to  a  distillation  column,  in  which  benzene  and 
methylcyclopentane  are  removed  (Stream  2)  and  routed  to  a  hydrogenation  unit.  The  bottoms 
(Stream  3)  from  the  column  containing  cyclohexane  and  other  hydrocarbons  are  combined  with 
another  petroleum  stream  (4)  and  sent  to  a  catalytic  reformer,  where  the  cyclohexane  is 
convened  to  benzene.  The  hydrogen  generated  in  this  step  may  be  used  in  the  hydrogenation 
step  or  used  elsewhere  in  the  petrochemical  complex. 

The  benzene-rich  stream  (5)  leaving  the  catalytic  reformer  is  sent  to  a  distillation 
column,  where  compounds  that  have  vapor  pressure  higher  than  benzene  (pentanes,  etc.)  are 
removed  (Stream  6)  and  used  as  byproducts.  The  benzene-rich  stream  (7)  that  is  left  is  sent  to 
another  distillation  column,  where  the  benzene  and  methylcyclopentane  (Stream  8)  are 
removed.  The  remaining  hydrocarbons  (largely  dimethylpentanes)  are  used  elsewhere  in  the 
petrochemical  complex  as  byproducts  (Stream  9). 

Stream  8  (benzene  and  methylcyclopentane)  is  combined  with  Stream  2  and  sent 
to  a  hydrogenation  unit  (Stream  10).  Hydrogen  is  fed  to  this  unit  and  the  benzene  is  converted 
to  cyclohexane.  Isomers  of  cyclohexane,  such  as  methylcyclopentane,  are  converted  to 
cyclohexane  in  an  isomerization  unit  (Stream  11)  and  the  effluent  from  this  equipment 
(Stream  12)  is  separated  in  a  final  distillation  step.  Pure  cyclohexane  (Stream  14)  is  separated 
from  isomers  of  cyclohexane  (Stream  13)  and  compounds  with  lower  vapor  pressures 
(Stream  15).

5.2.4 


Benzene  Emissions  from  Cyclohexane  Production  via  Separation  of  Petroleum 
Fractions 


There  are  no  process  emissions  during  normal  operation.76  During  emergency 
shutdowns,  individual  equipment  vents  are  opened  as  required. 

Equipment  leaks  can  be  sources  of  benzene,  cyclohexane,  methane,  or  other 
petroleum  compound  emissions.  Leaks  from  heat  exchangers  into  cooling  water  or  steam 
production  can  be  a  potential  fugitive  loss.  Equipment  leak  losses  have  special  significance 
because  of  the  high  diffusivity  of  hydrogen  at  elevated  temperatures  and  pressures  and  the 
extremely  flammable  nature  of  the  liquid  and  gas  processing  streams.77  No  specific  emission 
factors  or  component  counts  (valves,  flanges,  etc.)  were  found  for  benzene  associated  with 
equipment  leak  emissions  at  these  plants. 

A  potential  source  of  benzene  emissions  is  catalyst  handling.  Special  efforts  are 
made  to  remove  the  organic  compounds  from  the  spent  catalyst  before  it  is  replaced.  The 
spent  catalyst  is  sold  for  metal  recovery.76  No  emission  factors  were  found  for  benzene  as 
related  to  catalyst  handling. 

5.3  CUMENE  PRODUCTION 

Tn  the  United  States,  all  commercial  cumene  is  produced  by  the  reaction  of 
benzene  with  propylene.  Typically,  the  catalyst  is  phosphoric  acid,  but  sulfuric  acid  or 
aluminum  chloride  may  be  used.  Additionally,  various  new  processes  based  on  solid  zeolite 
catalysts  were  introduced  during  1993;  however,  information  about  these  new  processes  is 
limited,  and  they  are  not  discussed  in  this  section.  The  location  and  capacities  of  U.S. 
producers  of  cumene  are  provided  in  Table  5-4. 11,78

Note:  This  list  is  subject  to  change  as  market  conditions  change,  facility  ownership  changes,  plants  are  closed, 

etc.  The  reader  should  verify  the  existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  list  and/or  the 
plants  themselves.  The  level  of  benzene  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of  variables 
such  as  capacity,  throughput,  and  control  measures,  and  should  be  determined  through  direct  contacts 
with  plant  personnel.  These  locations,  producers,  and  capacities  were  current  as  of  November  1993. 


5.3.1  Process  Descriptions  for  Cumene  Production  bv  Alkylating  Benzene  with 

Propylene 

Cumene  is  present  in  crude  oils  and  refinery  streams.  However,  all  commercial 
cumene  is  produced  by  the  reaction  of  benzene  and  propylene. 


Benzene  and  propylene  are  reacted  at  elevated  temperatures  and  pressures  in  the 
presence  of  an  acidic  catalyst.  A  simplified  equation  for  this  reaction  is  as  follows: 


5-27 


C6H6  +  CH^CHCHj  [catalyst]  (CH3)2CHC6H5 
(benzene)  (propylene)  -  (cumene) 


The  exothermic  reaction  is  typically  conducted  using  solid  phosphoric  acid  as  a 
catalyst,  but  the  reaction  may  also  be  conducted  using  aluminum  chloride  or  sulfuric  acid  as 
the  catalyst.  The  aluminum  chloride  and  sulfuric  acid  processes  are  similar;  therefore,  the 
sulfuric  acid  process  is  not  described  here.79 

Solid  Phosphoric  Acid  Catalyst  Process 

Figure  5-7  is  a  typical  flow  diagram  for  the  manufacture  of  cumene  by  the 
process  using  phosphoric  acid  as  the  catalyst  support.80  Solid  phosphoric  acid  is  the  most 
favored  catalyst  system  for  manufacturing  cumene  and  is  a  selective  alkylation  catalyst  that 
promotes  the  alkylation  of  benzene  with  propylene  in  a  vapor-phase  system.79 

Because  the  catalyst  is  selective,  propylene  feedstock  for  this  process  does  not 
have  to  be  thoroughly  refined  before  use.  Crude  propylene  streams  (Stream  1)  from  refinery 
crackers  that  are  fractionated  to  about  70  percent  propylene  can  be  used  without  further 
purification.  The  benzene  (Stream  2)  used  in  this  process  does  not  have  to  be  dried  before  use 
because  the  catalyst  system  requires  small  amounts  of  water  vapor  in  the  reactor  stream  to 
activate  the  catalyst.79 

Propylene  and  benzene  (Streams  1  and  2)  are  combined  in  a  feed  drum  and  then 
fed  (Stream  3)  to  a  reactor  containing  the  phosphoric  acid  catalyst.  The  feed  ratio  is  normally 
at  least  four  moles  of  benzene  per  mole  of  propylene.  An  excess  of  benzene  is  maintained  in 
order  to  inhibit  side  reactions.  The  propylene  is  completely  consumed.  From  the  reactor,  the 
byproducts,  unreacted  material,  and  product  are  separated  by  distillation.  The  reaction 
products  (Stream  4)  are  sent  to  a  depropanizers  where  residual  hydrocarbons  (mostly  propane) 
are  removed.  The  propane  (Stream  5)  is  sent  through  a  condenser,  after  which  some  of  the

recovered  propane  is  recycled  to  the  reactor  (Stream  6)  for  cooling.  The  remainder  (Stream  7) 
can  be  returned  to  a  refinery  for  use  as  feedstock  or  fuel  gas.79 

Unpurified  product  from  the  depropanizer  (Stream  8)  is  sent  to  the  benzene 
distillation  column,  where  unreacted  benzene  is  recovered  overhead  (Stream  9),  sent  through  a 
condenser,  and  recycled  to  the  feed  drum  (Stream  10).  From  the  bottom  of  the  benzene 
column  (Stream  11),  the  crude  product  is  sent  to  the  cumene  distillation  column,  where  the 
high-purity  cumene  is  separated  from  heavy  aromatics  and  then  condensed  (Stream  12)  and 
stored  (Stream  13).  The  bottoms  (compounds  of  relatively  lower  volatility)  from  cumene 
distillation  (Stream  14)  contain  primarily  diisopropylbenzene  and  are  sent  to  a  refinery  or  used 
as  fuel  gas.79 


The  cumene  distillation  column  is  normally  operated  slightly  above  atmospheric 
pressure  and  is  padded  with  methane  (or  nitrogen)  to  protect  the  cumene  from  contact  with  the 
air.  As  the  pressure  fluctuates,  a  pressure-control  valve  relieves  excess  pressure  on  this  system 
by  bleeding  off  a  mixture  of  methane  (or  nitrogen)  and  cumene  vapor  (Vent  A).79 

Aluminum  Chloride  Catalyst  Process 

The  production  of  cumene  using  an  aluminum  chloride  catalyst  is  similar  to  that 
using  a  solid  phosphoric  acid  catalyst.  The  aluminum  chloride  method  requires  additional 
equipment  to  dry  recycled  streams  and  to  neutralize  reaction  products.  Figure  5-8  shows  a 
typical  process  diagram  for  cumene  manufacture  using  aluminum  chloride  as  the  alkylation 
catalyst.  Aluminum  chloride  is  a  much  more  active  and  much  less  selective  alkylation  catalyst 
than  solid  phosphoric  acid.79 

The  aluminum  chloride  used  as  a  catalyst  in  this  process  is  received  and  handled 
as  a  dry  powder.  To  prevent  undesirable  side  reactions,  the  propylene  used  with  this  catalyst 
system  must  be  of  chemical  grade  (95  percent  pure)  and  must  contain  no  more  than  minute 
amounts  of  other  olefins  such  as  ethylene  and  butylene.  This  propylene  feedstock  must  also  be

Catalyst 


dried  and  treated  (Stream  1)  to  remove  any  residual  organic  sulfur  compounds.  The  benzene 
used  in  this  process  must  be  azeotropically  dried  (Stream  2)  to  remove  dissolved  water.  The 
azeotrope  drying  distillation  generates  a  vent  gas  (Vent  A)  that  is  rich  in  benzene.79 

Benzene  and  propylene  (Streams  3  and  4)  are  fed  to  a  catalyst  mix  tank,  where 
the  aluminum  chloride  powder  (Stream  5)  is  added.  This  mixture  is  treated  with  HC1  gas 
(Stream  6)  to  activate  the  catalyst.  The  catalyst  preparation  operation  generates  a  vent  gas 
consisting  of  inert  gases  and  HC1  gas  saturated  with  vapors  of  benzene  and  diisopropylbenzene. 
A  scrubber  is  typically  used  to  absorb  the  HC1  gas  and  the  residual  vapors  are  then  vented 
(Vent  B).  The  resulting  catalyst  suspension  (Stream  7)  and  additional  dried  benzene  (Stream  8) 
are  fed  to  the  alkylation  reactor  as  liquids,  and  additional  dried  propylene  (Stream  9)  is 
introduced  into  the  bottom  of  the  reactor.  The  feed  ratio  to  the  alkylation  reactor  is  maintained 
at  or  above  four  moles  of  benzene  per  mole  of  propylene  to  inhibit  side  reactions.79 

The  crude  reaction  mixture  from  the  alkylation  reactor  (Stream  10)  is  sent  to  a 
degassing  vessel,  where  hydrocarbons  such  as  propane  are  released  from  solution  (Stream  11). 
This  vapor  stream  is  scrubbed  with  a  weak  caustic  solution  and  then  fed  (Stream  12)  to  the 
diisopropylbenzene  (DIPB)  scrubber,  where  the  hydrocarbon  vapor  is  recontacted  with  DIPB 
to  extract  residual  unreacted  propylene.  The  stream  containing  the  propylene  (Stream  13)  is 
sent  to  the  catalyst  mix  tank.79 

The  degassed  product  (Stream  14)  is  sent  to  the  acid  wash  tank,  where  it  is 
contacted  with  a  weak  acid  solution  that  breaks  down  the  catalyst  complex  and  dissolves  the 
aluminum  chloride  in  the  water  layer.  The  crude  product  from  the  acid  wash  tank  is  sent  to  a 
decanter  tank,  where  the  water  is  removed.  The  product  is  then  sent  to  a  caustic  wash  tank, 
where  any  residual  acid  in  the  product  is  extracted  and  neutralized.  The  product  is  decanted 
again  to  remove  water  and  then  enters  a  water  wash  tank,  where  it  is  mixed  with  fresh  process 
water.  This  process  water  extracts  and  removes  any  residual  salt  or  other  water  soluble 
material  from  the  product.  The  product  from  the  water  wash  tank  is  sent  to  a  third  decanter 
tank,  where  the  crude  product  and  water  settle  and  separate.79 


.5-32 


The  entire  wash-decanter  system  is  tied  together  by  one  common  vent-pad  line 
that  furnishes  nitrogen  for  blanketing  this  series  of  tanks.  A  pressure  control  valve  on  the  end 
of  the  vent-pad  manifold  periodically  releases  vent  gas  (Vent  C)  as  levels  rise  and  fall  in  the 
various  tanks  of  the  wash-decanter  system.  The  vent  gas  is  saturated  with  water  vapor  and 
hydrocarbon  vapor  (principally  benzene)  as  contained  VOC.79 

The  washed  and  decanted  product  (Stream  15)  is  stored  in  a  washed-product 
receiver  tank.  The  crude  product  from  the  washed-product  tank  (Stream  16)  is  sent  to  a 
recovery  column,  where  the  excess  benzene  is  stripped  out.  The  recovered  benzene 
(Stream  17)  is  returned  to  the  benzene  feed  tank.  The  vent  line  associated  with  the  benzene 
recovery  column  and  with  the  benzene  receiver  tank  releases  some  vent  gas  (Vent  D).  This 
vapor  is  principally  inert  gas  saturated  with  benzene  vapor  as  contained  VOC.79 

The  crude  cumene  (Stream  18)  is  sent  to  the  cumene  distillation  column  for 
distillation  of  the  cumene  product.  The  cumene  product  (Stream  19)  is  then  stored  for  sale  or 
in-plant  use.  The  cumene  distillation  column  and  the  associated  cumene  receiver  tank  are 
operated  above  atmospheric  pressure  and  are  blanketed  with  nitrogen  (or  methane)  to  protect 
the  cumene  from  reacting  with  oxygen  in  the  air  and  forming  cumene  hydroperoxide.  The  vent 
line  associated  with  the  cumene  distillation  column  and  with  the  cumene  receiver  tank  releases 
some  vent  gas  (Vent  E).  This  vent  gas  is  nitrogen  (or  methane)  saturated  with  cumene  vapor 
as  the  contained  VOC.79 

The  bottoms  from  the  cumene  distillation  column  contain  a  small  amount  of 
cumene,  along  with  mixed  isomers  of  diisopropylbenzene  and  a  small  amount  of  higher-boiling 
alkylbenzenes  and  miscellaneous  tars.  The  bottoms  stream  (Stream  20)  is  sent  to  a  DIPB 
stripping  column,  where  DIPB  is  recovered  and  then  stored  (Stream  21).  This  stripping 
column  is  normally  operated  under  vacuum  because  of  the  high-boiling  points  of  the  DIPB 
isomers.  The  vacuum  system  on  the  stripping  column  draws  a  vent  stream  from  the  column 
condenser,  and  this  vent  stream  is  air  (or  inert  gas)  saturated  with  cumene  and  DIPB  vapors  as 


5-33 


the  contained  VOC.  Depending  on  the  design  and  operation  of  the  vacuum  system  for  the 
column,  part  or  all  of  the  vent  gas  could  be  discharged  to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  F).79 

The  bottoms  from  the  DIPB  stripper  (Stream  22)  are  stored  in  a  receiver  tank 
and  then  sent  to  waste  disposal  for  use  as  a  fuel.  The  recycle  DIPB  (Stream  23)  is  sent  to  the 
DIPB  scrubber,  where  it  is  used  to  absorb  residual  propylene  from  the  propane  waste  gas 
stream.  This  recycle  DIPB  eventually  returns  to  the  alkylation  reactor,  where  it  is 
transalky lated  with  excess  benzene  to  generate  additional  cumene.79 

5.3.2  Benzene  Emissions  From  Cumene  Production 

Information  related  to  benzene  emissions  from  process  vents,  equipment  leaks, 
storage  vessels,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems,  and  product  loading  and 
transport  operations  associated  with  cumene  production  is  presented  below.  Where  a  literature 
review  has  revealed  no  source-specific  emission  factors  for  uncontrolled  or  controlled  benzene 
emissions  from  these  emission  points,  the  reader  is  referred  to  Section  5.10  of  this  chapter, 
which  provides  a  general  discussion  of  methods  for  estimating  uncontrolled  and  controlled 
benzene  emissions  from  these  emission  points. 

Benzene  Emissions  from  the  Solid  Phosphoric  Acid  Catalyst  Process 

In  the  solid  phosphoric  acid  process,  potential  process  vent  emissions  of  benzene 

may  be  associated  with  the  cumene  column  vent  (Vent  A  in  Figure  5-7).  Using  methane  to 
pressurize  the  system,  the  process  operates  at  a  pressure  slightly  higher  than  atmospheric 
pressure  to  make  sure  that  no  air  contacts  the  product.80  The  methane  is  eventually  vented  to 
the  atmosphere,  carrying  with  it  other  hydrocarbon  vapors.80 

No  specific  emission  factors  were  found  for  benzene  emissions  from  the  cumene 
column.  One  factor  for  total  VOC  emissions  indicated  that  0.015  lb  (0.03  kg)  of  total  VOC 
are  emitted  per  ton  (Mg)  of  cumene  produced,  and  that  benzene  constituted  a  “trace  amount” 


5-34 


of  the  hydrocarbons  in  the  stream.80  One  cumene  producer  has  indicated  that  it  uses  a  closed 
system  (all  process  vents  are  served  by  a  plant  flare  system).  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  there  are 
no  process  vent  emissions  occurring  directly  from  the  production  of  cumene,  although  there 
may  be  emissions  from  the  flares.79 

Benzene  Emissions  from  the  Aluminum  Chloride  Catalyst  Process 

Process  vent  emissions  of  benzene  from  the  production  of  cumene  using  an 
aluminum  chloride  catalyst  are  associated  with  the  benzene  drying  column  (Vent  A  in 
Figure  5-8),  the  scrubber  or  the  catalyst  mix  tank  (Vent  B),  the  wash-decanter  system 
(Vent  C),  the  benzene  recovery  column  (Vent  D),  the  cumene  distillation  system  (Vent  E),  and 
the  DIPB  stripping  system  (Vent  F).80  No  specific  emission  factors  were  located  for  benzene 
emissions  from  these  sources.  However,  as  presented  in  Table  5-5,  one  reference  provided 
total  VOC  emission  factors  and  estimates  of  benzene  percent  composition  of  the  emissions.3,80 
The  percent  (weight)  of  benzene  may  be  used  along  with  a  cumene  production  volume  to 
calculate  an  estimate  of  benzene  emissions  from  these  sources.  The  control  technique  most 
applicable  to  these  sources  is  flaring,  with  an  estimated  efficiency  of  at  least  98  percent  (see 
Section  4.5.1  of  this  chapter  for  further  discussion  of  this  control  device). 

5.4  PHENOL  PRODUCTION 

Most  U.S.  phenol  (97  percent)  is  produced  by  the  peroxidation  of  cumene,  a 
process  in  which  cumene  hydroperoxide  (CHP)  is  cleaved  to  yield  acetone  and  phenol,  as  well 
as  recoverable  by-products  a-methylstyrene  (AMS)  and  acetophenone.  Phenol  is  also 
produced  by  toluene  oxidation  and  distillation  from  petroleum  operations.81,82  Table  5-6  shows 
the  locations,  capabilities,  and  production  methods  of  the  phenol  producers  in  the  United 
States.11,81,83  Because  benzene  may  be  present  in  the  feedstock,  it  may  be  emitted  during 
production  of  phenol.

In  the  process  involving  peroxidation  of  cumene,  acetone  and  phenol  are 
produced  by  the  peroxidation  of  cumene  followed  by  cleavage  of  the  resulting  CHP.  The  two 
basic  reactions  for  this  process  are  as  follows:80 

C6H5CH(CH3)2  +  02-  C6H5COOH  (CH3)2 

(cumene)  (air)  (cumene  hydroperoxide) 

[H.SOJ 

C6H5COOH(CH3)2  ^  CH3COCH3  +  C6H5OH 
(cumene  hydroperoxide)  (acetone)  (phenol) 

5.4.1  Phenol  Production  Techniques 

There  are  two  technologies  for  producing  phenol  by  the  peroxidation  of 
cumene-one  licensed  by  Allied  Chemical  and  the  other  licensed  by  Hercules.  The  major 
.  differences  between  the  Allied  and  Hercules  processes  involve  the  operating  conditions  of  the 
peroxidation  reaction  and  the  method  of  neutralization  of  the  acid  in  the  cleavage  product. 
These  differences  affect  plant  design  primarily  in  the  peroxidation  and  cleavage-product 
neutralization  steps,  in  the  location  of  process  emission  points,  and  in  the  potential  quantity  of 
process  emissions.  These  two  process  types  are  discussed  below.80 

In  addition  to  the  two  cumene  peroxidation  processes,  phenol  is  produced  by  the 
oxidation  of  toluene.  This  process  is  described  below;  however,  the  description  is  brief 
because  of  limited  available  information  on  the  process. 

Allied  Process 

Figure  5-9  shows  a  typical  flow  diagram  for  the  manufacture  of  phenol  by  the 
Allied  process.79  Cumene  (Stream  1),  manufactured  on  site  or  shipped  to  the  site,  and  recycle 
cumene  (Stream  2)  are  combined  (Stream  3)  and  fed  with  air  (Stream  4)  to  the  multiple-reactor 
system,  where  cumene  is  oxidized  to  form  CHP.  Substantial  quantities  of  cumene  (Stream  5) 
are  carried  out  of  the  reactors  with  the  spent  air  to  a  refrigerated  vent  system,  where  part  of  the 


5-39 


5-40 


Figure  5-9.  Flow  Diagram  for  Phenol  Production  from  Cumene  Using  the  Allied  Process 


cumene  is  recovered  and  recycled.80  Uncondensed  vapors,  including  organic  compounds,  are 
vented  (Vent  A). 

The  reaction  product  (Stream  6),  containing  primarily  cumene  and  CHP,  is 
vacuum  flashed  first  in  the  pre-flash  distillation  column  and  then  (Stream  8)  in  the  flash 
distillation  column  to  remove  most  of  the  cumene,  which  is  recycled  (Streams  7  and  9). 
Uncondensed  vapors,  including  organic  compounds,  are  vented  (Vents  B  and  C).  The 
concentrated  CHP  (Stream  10)  flows  through  the  CHP  concentrate  tank  to  the  cleavage  reactor, 
where  the  CHP  is  cleaved  to  acetone  and  phenol  by  the  addition  of  S02  (Stream  11).  The 
cleavage  product  (Stream  12)  is  neutralized  in  ion-exchange  columns  and  fed  through  the 
crude-product  surge  tank  (Stream  13)  to  a  multi-column  distillation  system. 80,84,85 

In  the  primary  crude  acetone  distillation  column,  acetone  and  lower-boiling 
impurities  such  as  acetaldehyde  and  formaldehyde  are  distilled  overhead.  This  product 
(Stream  14)  is  condensed  and  flows  through  the  crude  acetone  surge  tank  to  the  acetone 
refining  column,  where  the  acetone  is  distilled  overhead.  Acetone  product  is  condensed 
(Stream  15)  and  sent  to  storage.  Uncondensed  vapors,  including  organic  compounds,  are 
vented  from  the  condensers  after  both  the  primary  crude  acetone  and  acetone  refining  columns 
(Vents  D  and  E). 80,84 

The  compounds  of  relatively  lower  volatility  (bottoms)  from  the  primary  crude 
acetone  column  (Stream  16)  are  distilled  in  the  cumene  recover}'  column  to  remove  residual 

cumene.  The  overheads  from  the  cumene  recovery  column  are  sent  through  a  condenser 
(Stream  17)  and  into  a  secondary  crude  acetone  distillation  column  to  further  remove  acetone 
from  the  residual  cumene.  The  residual  cumene  (i.e.,  the  bottoms  from  the  secondary  crude 
acetone  column)  is  stored  for  recycling.80  The  uncondensed  vapors  from  the  condensers, 
following  both  the  cumene  recovery  column  and  secondary  crude  acetone  column  are  vented 
(Vents  F  and  G).  The  condensed  overheads  from  the  secondary  crude  acetone  column 
(Stream  18)  are  fed  through  a  crude  acetone  surge  tank  back  to  the  acetone  refining  column. 


5-41 


Some  facilities  using  this  process  may  not  incorporate  the  secondary  crude 
acetone  distillation  column,  which  is  utilized  both  to  further  recover  acetone  product  and  to 
reduce  organic  emissions  from  the  storage  tanks  containing  the  recycle  cumene.  Some 
processes  store  the  condensed  product  from  the  overhead  of  the  cumene  recovery  column  as 
the  recycle  cumene  (Stream  17). 

The  bottoms  from  the  cumene  recovery  column  (Stream  19)  contain  primarily 
phenol,  AMS,  acetophenone,  and  other  organics  with  higher  boiling  points  than  phenol.  This 
stream  is  fed  to  the  crude  AMS  distillation  column.  The  crude  AMS  distillation  column 
overhead  stream  (Stream  20)  is  condensed  and  sent  to  the  AMS  refining  column.  Uncondensed 
vapors  from  the  condenser  after  the  crude  AMS  distillation  column  are  vented  (Vent  H).  The 
stream  entering  the  AMS  refining  column  undergoes  distillation  to  refme  out  AMS.  The 
refined  overhead  stream  is  condensed  (Stream  21)  and  sent  to  additional  columns  (not  shown) 
for  further  refining. 

The  uncondensed  vapors  from  the  condenser  following  the  AMS  refining 
column  are  vented  (Vent  I).  The  bottoms  from  the  AMS  refining  column  (Stream  22)  are 
stored  in  a  crude  phenol  tank.  The  phenol  in  this  storage  tank  is  either  sold  as  crude  product 
or  is  fed  to  the  phenol  refining  column  for  further  refining.  Crude  phenol  from  the  bottom  of 
the  crude  AMS  column  (Stream  23)  flows  to  the  phenol  refining  column,  where  phenol  is 
distilled  overhead,  condensed,  (Stream  24),  and  fed  to  phenol  product  storage  tanks.  The 
uncondensed  vapors  from  the  condenser  following  the  phenol  refining  column  are  vented 
(Vent  J).80-84-85 


The  bottoms  from  the  phenol  refining  column  (Stream  25)  are  further  processed 
to  recover  phenol.  The  bottoms  are  sent  to  a  phenol  topping  column,  from  which  the  overhead 
stream  is  condensed  (Stream  26)  and  fed  to  phenol  product  storage.  Uncondensed  vapors  from 
the  condenser  after  the  phenol  topping  column  are  vented  (Vent  K).  The  bottoms  from  the 
phenol  topping  column  (Stream  27)  are  fed  to  a  phenol  residue  stripping  column,  which 
removes  phenol  residue  in  the  bottoms  (Stream  29).  The  phenol  residue  may  be  used  as  fuel 


5-42 


for  on-site  industrial  boilers.  The  overheads  from  the  phenol  residue  stripping  column  are 
condensed  (Stream  28)  and  fed  back  to  the  phenol  topping  column  to  further  recover  phenol 
product.  The  uncondensed  vapors  from  the  condenser  following  the  phenol  residue  stripping 
column  are  vented  (Vent  L). 84,85 

The  phenolic  wastewater  generated  by  the  Allied  process  (e.g.,  generated  by 
recovery  devices,  such  as  condensers  and  scrubbers)  is  fed  through  distillation  columns  to 
further  recover  acetone  and  phenol  products.  This  batch  distillation  cycle,  which  is  not  a 
continuous  process,  is  not  shown  in  Figure  5-9.  Phenolic  wastewater  is  fed  through  a 
dephenolizer  (i.e.,  a  steam  stripping  process)  and  one  or  two  batch  distillation  columns.  The 
recovered  product  is  crude  phenol  or  acetol  phenol.84'86 

Hercules  Process 

Figure  5-10  shows  a  typical  flow  diagram  for  the  manufacture  of  acetone  and 
phenol  by  the  Hercules  process.79  Cumene  from  storage  (Stream  1)  and  recycle  cumene 
(Streams  2  and  9)  are  combined  (Stream  3)  and  then  fed  with  air  (Stream  4)  to  the  multiple- 
reactor  system.  Additionally,  an  aqueous  sodium  carbonate  solution  (Stream  5)  is  fed  to  the 
reactor  system  to  promote  the  peroxidation  reaction.  In  the  reactor  system,  cumene  is 
peroxidized  to  cumene  hydroperoxide.  Unreacted  cumene  is  carried  out  of  the  reactors  with 
the  spent  air  (Stream  6)  to  a  refrigerated  vent  system,  where  part  of  the  cumene  is  recovered 
and  recycled  (Stream  2).  Uncondensed  vapors  are  vented  (Vent  A).80 

The  oxidation  reaction  product  (Stream  7)  flows  into  a  separator  to  remove 
spent  carbonate  solution  and  then  is  washed  with  water  to  remove  remaining  carbonate  and 
other  soluble  components.  The  air  stream  removed  is  sent  to  a  condenser  from  which 
uncondensed  vapors  are  vented  (Vent  B).  The  washed  product  (Stream  8)  is  fed  to  a 
distillation  column  operated  under  vacuum,  where  the  cumene  hydroperoxide  is  separated  from 
the  cumene.  The  overheads  from  the  CHP  concentrator  are  condensed  and  the  recovered

cumene  (Stream  9)  is  recycled.  The  uncondensed  vapors  from  the  condenser  are  vented 
(Vent  C). 


The  concentrated  CHP  (Stream  10)  is  transferred  through  a  surge  tank  to  the 
cleavage  reactor  (Stream  11).  Sulfuric  acid,  diluted  to  5  to  10  percent  with  acetone 
(Stream  12),  is  added  to  catalyze  the  decomposition  of  CHP  to  acetone  and  phenol.80 
Uncondensed  vapors  captured  from  the  cleavage  reactor  are  vented  (Vent  D).  Excess  acid  in 
the  cleaved  mixture  (Stream  13)  is  neutralized  with  sodium  hydroxide  solution  (Stream  14). 
The  neutralized  product  (Stream  15)  flows  through  the  crude-product  surge  tank  to  a 
multi-column  distillation  train  to  produce  product-grade  acetone,  phenol,  and  AMS.80 

The  crude  product  is  separated  in  the  first  distillation  column  into  a  crude 
acetone  fraction  (Stream  16)  and  a  crude  phenol  stream  (Stream  17).  The  crude  acetone 
(Stream  16)  is  combined  with  recycled  hydrocarbons  from  the  phenol  topping  column 
(Stream  18)  and  fed  through  a  surge  tank  to  the  light-ends  column  (Stream  19)  to  strip 
low-boiling  hydrocarbon  impurities,  such  as  acetaldehyde  and  formaldehyde,  which  are  vented 
to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  E). 

The  bottoms  stream  from  the  light-ends  column  (Stream  20)  is  fed  to  the  acetone 
finishing  column,  where  the  acetone  is  distilled  overhead,  condensed  (Stream  21),  and  sent  to 
day  tanks  and  subsequently  to  acetone  product  storage  and  loading.  Uncondensed  vapors  are 
vented  (Vent  F).  The  bottoms  stream  (Stream  22)  is  processed  to  produce  AMS  (not  shown).80 

The  crude  phenol  stream  (Stream  17)  and  the  bottoms  from  the  phenol  finishing 
column  (Stream  23)  are  fed  to  the  heavy-ends  column  and  distilled  under  vacuum  to  separate 
tars  (Stream  24)  from  the  impure  phenol  stream  (Stream  25). 80  Uncondensed  vapors  from  the 
condenser  following  the  heavy -ends  column  are  vented  (Vent  G). 

The  impure  phenol  is  fed  to  the  phenol  topping  column  to  remove  hydrocarbons 
such  as  cumene  and  AMS.  The  overhead  stream  from  the  phenol  topping  column  (Stream  18) 


5-46 


may  be  condensed  and  recycled  to  the  light-ends  column  of  the  acetone  process  for  removal  of 
residual  acetone,  cumene,  and  AMS.  The  uncondensed  vapors  from  the  condenser  following 
the  phenol  topping  column  are  vented  (Vent  H).  The  phenolic  stream  (Stream  26)  is  then  fed 

to  a  dehydrating  column,  where  water  is  removed  overhead  as  a  phenol/water  azeotrope. 

* 

Uncondensed  vapors  are  vented  (Vent  I).80 

The  dried  phenol  stream  (Stream  27)  is  distilled  under  vacuum  in  the  phenol 
finishing  column  to  separate  product-quality  phenol  (Stream  28)  from  higher  boiling 
components  (Stream  23),  which  are  recycled  to  the  heavy  ends  column.  Uncondensed  vapors 
from  the  condenser  after  the  phenol  finishing  column  are  vented  (Vent  J).  The  product-quality 
phenol  is  stored  in  tanks  for  subsequent  loading.80 

Toluene  Oxidation  Process 

In  this  process,  toluene  is  oxidized  by  air  to  benzoic  acid.  Following 
separation,  the  benzoic  acid  is  catalytically  converted  to  phenol. 

5.4.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Phenol  Production 

Information  related  to  benzene  emissions  from  process  vents,  equipment  leaks, 
storage  vessels,  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems,  and  product  loading  and 
transport  operations  associated  with  phenol  production  is  presented  below.  Where  a  literature 
review  revealed  no  source-specific  emission  factors  for  uncontrolled  or  controlled  benzene 
emissions  from  these  emission  points,  the  reader  is  referred  to  Section  5.10  of  this  chapter, 
which  provides  a  general  discussion  of  methods  for  estimating  uncontrolled  and  controlled 
benzene  emissions  from  these  types  of  emission  points. 

“Spent  air”  from  the  oxidizer  reactor  (Vent  A,  Figure  5-9)  is  the  largest  source 
of  benzene  emissions  at  phenol  production  plants  utilizing  the  Allied  process.87  Table  5-7 
provides  uncontrolled  and  controlled  (i.e.,  thermal  oxidizer)  emission  factors  from  the  oxidizer

reactor  vent  from  the  phenol  production  process  based  on  the  peroxidation  of  cumene.88,89 
Charcoal  adsorption  is  the  most  commonly  used  method  to  control  emissions  from  the  oxidizer 
reactor  vent;  however,  condensation,  absorption,  and  thermal  oxidation  have  also  been  used.90 
Recovery  devices  (i.e.,  one  or  more  condensers  and/or  absorbers)  are  the  most  commonly  used 
methods  to  recover  product  and  control  emissions  from  the  cleavage  (Vent  D,  Figure  5-9)  and 
product  purification  distillation  columns;  however,  adsorption  and  incineration  have  also  been 
used  for  emissions  reduction.81,90 

5.5  NITROBENZENE  PRODUCTION 

Benzene  is  a  major  feedstock  in  commercial  processes  used  to  produce 
nitrobenzene.  Approximately  5  percent  of  benzene  production  in  the  United  States  is  used  in 
the  production  of  nitrobenzene.12  In  these  processes,  benzene  is  directly  nitrated  with  a 
mixture  of  nitric  acid,  sulfuric  acid,  and  water. 

As  of  February  1991,  five  companies  were  producing  nitrobenzene  in  the  United 
States.91  Their  names  and  plant  locations  are  shown  in  Table  5-8. 11  In  addition  to  these  plants, 
plans  are  underway  for  Miles  and  First  Chemical  to  start  up  a  possible  250-million-pound 
(113.4-Gg)  aniline  plant,  along  with  feedstock  nitrobenzene,  at  Baytown,  Texas.92 

A  discussion  of  the  nitrobenzene  production  process,  potential  sources  of 
benzene  emissions,  and  control  techniques  is  presented  in  this  section.  Unless  otherwise 
referenced,  the  information  that  follows  has  been  taken  directly  from  Reference  93. 

5.5.1  Process  Descriptions  for  Continuous  Nitration 

Nitrobenzene  is  produced  by  a  highly  exothermic  reaction  in  which  benzene  is 
reacted  with  nitric  acid  in  the  presence  of  sulfuric  acid.  Most  commercial  plants  use  a  continuous

The  reader  should  verify  the  existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  lists  and/or  the  plants 
themselves.  The  level  of  benzene  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of  variables  such  as 
capacity,  throughput,  and  control  measures,  and  should  be  determined  through  direct  contacts  with  plant 
personnel.  These  data  on  producers  and  location  were  current  as  of  January  1993. 

nitration  process,  where  benzene  and  the  acids  are  mixed  in  a  series  of  continuous  stirred- 
tank  reactors.94  A  flow  diagram  of  the  basic  continuous  process  is  shown  in  Figure  5-1 1 ,93 

As  shown  in  the  figure,  nitric  acid  (Stream  1)  and  sulfuric  acid  (Stream  2)  are  mixed  before 
flowing  into  the  reactor.  Benzene  extract  (Stream  6),  two  recovered  and  recycled  benzene 
streams  (Streams  7  and  8),  and  as  much  additional  benzene  (Stream  9)  as  is  required  are  combined 
to  make  up  the  benzene  charge  to  the  reactor. 

For  the  process  depicted  here,  nitration  occurs  at  131  °F  (55 °C)  under 
atmospheric  pressure.  Cooling  coils  are  used  to  remove  the  heat  generated  by  the  reaction.

Following  nitration,  the  crude  reaction  mixture  (Stream  3)  flows  to  the  decanter, 
where  the  organic  phase  of  crude  nitrobenzene  is  separated  from  the  aqueous  waste  acid.  The 
crude  nitrobenzene  (Stream  12)  subsequently  flows  to  the  washer  and  neutralizer,  where 
mineral  (inorganic)  and  organic  acids  are  removed.  The  washer  and  neutralizer  effluent  are 
discharged  to  wastewater  treatment.  The  organic  layer  (Stream  13)  is  fed  to  the  nitrobenzene 
stripper,  where  water  and  most  of  the  benzene  and  other  low-boiling-point  components  are 
carried  overhead.  The  organic  phase  carried  overhead  is  primarily  benzene  and  is  recycled 
(Stream  7)  to  the  reactor.  The  aqueous  phase  (carried  overhead)  is  sent  to  the  washer. 

Stripped  nitrobenzene  (Stream  14)  is  cooled  and  then  transferred  to  nitrobenzene  storage. 

The  treatment,  recycling,  or  discharge  of  process  streams  is  also  shown  in  the 
flow  diagram.  Aqueous  waste  acid  (Stream  4)  from  the  decanter  flows  to  the  extractor,  where 
it  is  denitrated.  There,  the  acid  is  treated  with  fresh  benzene  from  storage  (Stream  5)  to 
extract  most  of  the  dissolved  nitrobenzene  and  nitric  acid.  The  benzene  extract  (Stream  6) 
flow's  back  to  the  nitrating  reactor,  whereas  the  denitrated  acid  is  stored  in  the  waste  acid  tank. 

Benzene  is  commonly  recovered  from  the  waste  acid  by  distillation  in  the  acid 
stripper.  The  benzene  recovered  is  recycled  (Stream  8),  and  water  carried  overhead  with  the 
benzene  is  forwarded  (Stream  11)  to  the  washer.  The  stripped  acid  (Stream  10)  is  usually 
reconcentrated  on  site  but  may  be  sold.93 

Typically,  many  of  the  process  steps  are  padded  with  nitrogen  gas  to  reduce  the 
chances  of  fire  or  explosion.  This  nitrogen  padding  gas  and  other  inert  gases  are  purged  from 
vents  associated  with  the  reactor  and  separator  (Vent  A  in  Figure  5-11),  the  condenser  on  the 
acid  stripper  (Vent  B),  the  washer  and  neutralizer  (Vent  C),  and  the  condenser  on  the 
nitrobenzene  stripper  (Vent  D).

5.5.2 


Benzene  Emissions  from  Nitrobenzene  Production 


Benzene  emissions  may  occur  at  numerous  points  during  the  manufacture  of 
nitrobenzene.  These  emissions  may  be  divided  into  four  types:  process  emissions,  storage 
emissions,  equipment  leak  emissions,  and  secondary  emissions. 

Process  emissions  occur  at  the  following  four  gas-purge  vents:  the  reactor  and 
separator  vent  (A),  the  acid  stripper  vent  (B),  the  washer  and  neutralizer  vent  (C),  and  the 
nitrobenzene  stripper  vent  (D).  The  bulk  of  benzene  emissions  occur  from  the  reactor  and 
separator  vent.  This  vent  releases  about  three  times  the  level  of  benzene  released  from 
Vents  B  and  D  (Figure  5-11),  and  about  120  times  that  released  from  Vent  C.  For  all  of  these 
vents,  the  majority  of  VOC  emissions  is  in  the  form  of  benzene.  Benzene  accounts  for  99, 

100,  76,  and  99  percent  of  total  VOC  emissions  from  Vents  A,  B,  C,  and  D,  respectively. 
Table  5-9  shows  estimated  emission  factors  for  benzene  from  these  sources.93 

Other  emissions  include  storage,  equipment  leak,  and  secondary  emissions. 
Storage  emissions  (G)  occur  from  tanks  storing  benzene,  waste  acid,  and  nitrobenzene. 
Equipment  leak  emissions  of  benzene  can  occur  when  leaks  develop  in  valves,  pump  seals,  and 
other  equipment.  Leaks  can  also  occur  from  corrosion  by  the  sulfuric  and  nitric  acids  and  can 
hinder  control  of  fugitive  emissions. 

Secondary  emissions  can  result  from  the  handling  and  disposal  of  process  waste 
liquid.  Three  potential  sources  of  secondary  benzene  emissions  (J)  are  the  wastewater  from  the 
nitrobenzene  washer,  waste  caustic  from  the  nitrobenzene  neutralizer,  and  waste  acid  from  the 
acid  stripper.  Where  waste  acid  is  not  stripped  before  its  sale  or  reconcentration,  secondary 
emissions  will  be  significantly  affected  (increased)  unless  the  reconcentration  process  is 
adequately  controlled. 

Table  5-9  gives  benzene  emission  factors  before  and  after  the  application  of 
possible  controls  for  two  hypothetical  plants  using  the  continuous  nitration  process.  The  two

plants  differ  in  capacity;  one  produces  198  million  lb/yr  (90,000  Mg/yr)  and  the  other 
331  million  lb/yr  (150,000  Mg/yr)  of  nitrobenzene.  Both  plants  use  a  vent  absorber  or  thermal 
oxidizer  to  control  process  emissions  in  conjunction  with  waste-acid  storage  and  small  benzene 
storage  emissions. 

The  values  presented  for  the  main  benzene  storage  emissions  were  calculated  by 
assuming  that  a  contact-type  internal  floating  roof  with  secondary  seals  will  reduce  fixed-roof 
tank  emissions  by  85  percent.  The  values  presented  for  controlled  equipment  leak  emissions 
are  based  on  the  assumption  that  leaks  from  valves  and  pumps,  resulting  in  concentrations 
greater  than  10,000  ppm  on  a  volume  basis,  are  detected,  and  that  appropriate  measures  are 
taken  to  correct  the  leaks. 

Secondary  emissions  and  nitrobenzene  storage  emissions  are  assumed  to  be 
uncontrolled.  Uncontrolled  emission  factors  are  based  on  the  assumptions  given  in  the 
footnotes  to  Table  5-9.  The  total  controlled  emission  factors  for  these  hypothetical  plants 
range  from  0.44  to  0.78  lb/ton  (0.22  to  0.39  kg/Mg).  Actual  emissions  from  nitrobenzene 
plants  would  be  expected  to  vary,  depending  on  process  variations,  operating  conditions,  and 
control  methods.93 

A  variety  of  control  devices  may  be  used  to  reduce  emissions  during 
nitrobenzene  production,  but  insufficient  information  is  available  to  determine  which  devices 
nitrobenzene  producers  are  using  currently.  Process  emissions  may  be  reduced  by 
vent  absorbers,  water  scrubbers,  condensers,  incinerators,  and/or  thermal  oxidizers. 

Storage  emissions  from  the  waste-acid  storage  tank  and  the  small  benzene 
storage  tank  can  be  readily  controlled  in  conjunction  with  the  process  emissions.  (A  small 
storage  tank  contains  approximately  one  day's  supply  of  benzene;  the  larger  tank  is  the  main 
benzene  storage  tank.)  In  contrast,  emissions  from  the  main  benzene  storage  tanks  are 
controlled  by  using  floating-roof  storage  tanks. 


5-57 


Equipment  leak  emissions  are  generally  controlled  by  leak  detection  and  repair, 
whereas  secondary  emissions  are  generally  uncontrolled. 

5.6  ANILINE  PRODUCTION 

Almost  97  percent  of  the  nitrobenzene  produced  in  the  United  States  is 
converted  to  aniline.91  Because  of  its  presence  as  an  impurity  in  nitrobenzene,  benzene  may  be 
emitted  during  aniline  production.  Therefore,  a  brief  discussion  of  the  production  of  aniline 
from  nitrobenzene  and  its  associated  benzene  emissions  is  included  in  this  document. 

Table  5-10  lists  the  U.S.  producers  of  aniline  and  the  production  method.11  The 
mam  derivative  of  aniline  (75  percent)  is  p.p. -methylene  diphenyl  diisocyanate  (MDI).  The 
growth  outlook  for  aniline  is  expected  to  remain  strong  because  of  its  continued  use  in  housing 
and  automobile  parts.95 

5.6.1  Process  Descriptions  for  Aniline  Production  for  Nitrobenzene 

A  process  flow  diagram  of  the  most  widely  used  process  for  manufacturing  of 
aniline— by  hydrogen  reduction  of  nitrobenzene-is  shown  in  Figure  5-12. 96  As  shown  in  the 
figure,  nitrobenzene  (Stream  1)  is  vaporized  and  fed  with  excess  hydrogen  (Stream  2)  to  a 
fluidized-bed  reactor.  The  product  gases  (Stream  3)  are  passed  through  a  condenser.  The 
condensed  materials  are  decanted  (Stream  4),  and  non-condensible  materials  are  recycled  to  the 
reactor  (Stream  5).  In  the  decanter,  one  phase  (Stream  6)  is  crude  aniline  and  the  other  is  an 
aqueous  phase  (Stream  7). 

The  crude  aniline  phase  is  routed  to  a  dehydration  column  that  operates  under 
vacuum.  Aniline  is  recovered  from  the  aqueous  phase  by  stripping  or  extraction  with 
nitrobenzene.  Overheads  from  the  dehydration  column  (Stream  8)  are  condensed  and  recycled 
to  the  decanter.  The  bottoms  from  the  dehydration  column  (Stream  9),  which  contain  aniline,

are  sent  to  the  purification  column.  Overheads  (Stream  10)  from  the  purification  column 
contain  the  aniline  product,  while  the  bottoms  (Stream  11)  contain  tars. 

Fourteen  percent  of  current  aniline  production  (produced  by  Miles,  Inc.) 
involves  an  acid-iron  reduction  process  where  iron  oxide  is  created  as  a  co-product. 
Nitrobenzene  is  reacted  with  iron  and  dilute  hydrochloric  acid  at  reflux.  When  the  reaction  is 
complete,  the  aniline- water  mixture  is  separated  from  the  iron-hydroxide  sludge  and  the 
heavier  aniline  layer  is  removed  and  vacuum  distilled  to  yield  purified  aniline.18 

5.6.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Aniline  Production 

Process  emissions  of  benzene  typically  originate  from  the  purging  of  non¬ 
condensibles  during  recycle  to  the  reactor  and  purging  of  inert  gases  from  separation  and 
purification  equipment  (Vent  A  in  Figure  5-12). 9 

Only  one  emission  factor  was  found  for  benzene  emissions  from  aniline 
production.  For  process  vents  (Vent  A),  an  uncontrolled  emission  factor  of  0.0114  lb 
benzene/ton  aniline  produced  (0.0057  kg/Mg)  was  reported  in  the  literature.96  The  SCC  code 
for  this  emission  point  is  3-01-034-03:  Aniline-Reactor  Recycle  Process  Vent.  No  details  of 
the  emission  factor  derivation  were  provided,  other  than  it  was  based  on  data  provided  by  an 
aniline  producer,  so  it  was  assigned  a  U  rating. 

Control  techniques  available  for  emissions  associated  with  the  purging  of 
equipment  vents  include  water  scrubbing  and  thermal  oxidation.96  No  data  were  found  to 
indicate  the  efficiencies  of  these  control  devices  for  benzene  emissions.  The  reader  is  urged  to 
contact  specific  production  facilities  before  applying  the  emission  factor  given  in  this  report  to 
determine  exact  process  conditions  and  control  techniques.

CHLOROBENZENE  PRODUCTION 


The  most  important  chlorobenzenes  for  industrial  applications  are 
monochlorobenzene  (MCB),  dichlorobenzene  (DCB),  and  trichlorobenzene  (TCB).  Therefore, 
this  section  focuses  on  benzene  emissions  associated  with  production  of  these  three  types  of 
chlorobenzenes.  Table  5-11  lists  the  U.S.  producers  of  MCB,  DCB,  and  TCB.  The  producing 
companies'  capabilities  are  flexible,  such  that  different  chlorobenzenes  may  be  isolated, 
depending  on  market  demand.  DCBs  and  TCBs  are  produced  in  connection  with  MCB.  The 
relative  amounts  of  the  products  can  be  varied  by  process  control.97 

5.7.1  Process  Description  for  Chlorobenzene  Production  bv  Direct  Chlorination  of 

Benzene 


The  most  widely  used  process  for  the  manufacture  of  chlorobenzenes  is  direct 
chlorination  of  benzene  in  the  presence  of  ferric  chloride  catalyst  to  produce  MCB  and  DCB. 
HC1  is  a  by-product.  The  two  major  isomers  of  DCB  are  ortho  and  para.  As  chlorination 
continues,  tri-,  tetra-,  penta-,  and,  finally,  hexachlorobenzenes  are  formed.  However,  TCB  is 
the  only  one  of  the  more  highly  chlorinated  products  found  in  significant  amounts. 

Basic  operations  that  may  be  used  in  the  continuous  production  of  MCB  are 
shown  in  Figure  5- 13. 19  The  process  begins  with  a  series  of  small,  externally  cooled  cast  iron 
or  steel  vessels  containing  the  catalyst  (which  may  consist  of  Rashing  rings  of  iron  or  iron 
wire).  Chlorine  is  supplied  into  each  vessel  through  suitably  positioned  inlets  to  maintain  a 
large  benzene-to-chlorine  reaction  at  all  points  along  the  reaction  stream.  The  temperature  is 
held  between  68  to  104°F  (20  to  40 °C)  to  minimize  the  production  of  DCBs,  which  form  at 
higher  temperatures.  Dry  benzene  (Stream  1)  and  dried  recycled  benzene  (Stream  2)  are 
introduced  into  the  reactor,  which  produces  an  overhead  gas  (Stream  3). 

The  gas  stream  (containing  HC1,  unreacted  chlorine,  inert  gases  from  the 
chlorine  feed,  benzene,  and  other  VOC)  is  sent  to  an  organic  absorber,  where  benzene  and

ownership  changes,  or  plants  are  closed  down.  The  reader  should  verify  the  existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  lists  or  the 
plants  themselves.  The  level  of  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of  variables  such  as  throughput  and  control  measures,  and  should 
be  determined  through  direct  contacts  with  plant  personnel.  The  data  on  producers  and  locations  were  current  as  of  January  1993.

other  VOC  are  removed.  The  bottoms  from  the  organic  absorber  (Stream  6)  flow  to  the  HC1 
stripper  for  recovery  of  HC1.  The  overhead  gas  (Stream  5)  is  sent  to  HC1  absorption. 
By-product  HC1  is  then  removed  in  the  HC1  absorber,  where  it  is  saturated  by  washing  with  a 
refrigerated  solvent  (e.g.,  o-DCB)  or  low  vapor  pressure  oil,  and  then  recovered  in  wash 
towers  as  commercially  usable  hydrochloric  acid.98 

Crude  reaction  liquid  product  (Stream  4)  enters  the  crude  chlorobenzene 
distillation  column,  which  produces  overheads  (Stream  7)  that  contains  most  of  the 
chlorobenzenes,  unreacted  benzene,  and  some  HC1,  and  a  bottom  stream  from  which  catalyst 
and  other  byproducts  are  separated  (Stream  8)  and  processed  for  reuse.  The  overheads 
(Stream  7)  pass  through  an  HC1  stripper  and  into  a  benzene  recovery  column  (Stream  9).  Part 
of  the  subsequent  benzene-free  stream  (Stream  10)  is  returned  to  the  organic  absorber;  the 
remainder  (Stream  1 1)  enters  the  MCB  distillation  column.  The  overhead  MCB  distillation 
product  (Stream  12)  is  then  stored  and  the  bottom  stream  containing  DCB  and  TCB  isomers  is 
processed.98 


Figure  5-14  presents  basic  operations  that  may  be  used  to  produce  o-  and  p-DCB 
and  TCB.  In  a  continuation  of  the  production  of  MCB,  o-  and  p-DCB  can  be  separated  by 
fractional  distillation.  Isomer  fractionation  yields  p-DCB  (with  traces  of  o-DCB  and  m-DCB), 
which  enters  the  overhead  (Stream  1);  the  o-DCB  enters  the  bottoms  (Stream  2).  The  o-DCB 
bottoms  (Stream  2)  undergoes  fractional  distillation  and  produces  an  o-DCB  overhead 
(Stream  3),  which  is  sent  to  storage,  and  bottoms  (Stream  4),  which  is  further  processed  to 
yield  TCBs.98 


The  crude  p-DCB  with  other  trace  isomers  (Stream  5)  is  purified  by  batch 
crystallization.  Part  of  the  purified  p-DCB  (Stream  6)  is  sent  to  liquid  storage.  The  remainder 
(Stream  7)  undergoes  freezing,  crushing,  screening,  and  packing  of  p-DCB  crystals.  The 
mother  liquor  from  crystallization  (Stream  8)  is  sent  to  DCB  solvent-grade  ffactionalization, 
where  it  is  separated  into  solvent  grade  o-DCB  (Stream  9)  and  p-DCB  (Stream  10)  and 
stored.98

Figure  5-14.  Dichlorobenzene  and  Trichlorobenzene  Continuous  Production  Diagram 


The  isolation  of  m-DCB  from  mixed  DCB  streams  is  not  economical,  because  it 
usually  occurs  at  a  level  of  1  percent  or  less.  Metadichlorobenzene  is  sold  with  other  isomers 
as  mixed  chlorobenzenes.98 

* 

Other  processes  that  are  most  often  used  in  the  production  of  MCB  are  the  batch 
and  Rashing  methods.98  Other  TCB  production  processes  are  the  reaction  of  a,  P,  or 
y -benzene  hexachloride  with  alcoholic  potash,  the  dehalogenation  of  a-benzene  hexachloride 
with  pyridine,  and  the  reaction  of  a-benzene  hexachloride  with  calcium  hydroxide  to  form 
primarily  1,2,4-TCB.19 

5.7.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Chlorobenzene  Production 

The  primary  source  of  benzene  emissions  during  MCB  production  is  the  tail  gas 
treatment  vent  of  the  tail  gas  scrubber  (Vent  A  in  Figure  5-13).  Usually,  this  vent  does  not 
have  a  control  device.19  Other  potential  sources  of  benzene  emissions  are  atmospheric 
distillation  vents  from  the  benzene  drying  column,  heavy-ends  processing,  the  benzene 
recovery  column,  and  MCB  distillation  (Vents  B,  C,  D,  E  in  Figure  5-13,  respectively), 
equipment  leak  emissions,  emissions  from  benzene  storage,  and  secondary  emissions  from 
wastewater.19 

Table  5-12  presents  estimated  controlled  and  uncontrolled  emission  factors  for 
benzene  emissions  from  the  tail  gas  treatment  vent,  atmospheric  distillation  vents,  equipment 
leak  emissions,  and  benzene  storage.19  The  point  source  factors  are  based  on  emissions 
reported  to  EPA  in  response  to  information  requests  and  trip  reports.19  For  information  on 
emission  factors  for  estimating  equipment  leak  and  storage  tank  emissions  refer  to 
Sections  4.5.2  and  4.5.3  respectively  of  this  document.  As  noted  in  Table  5-12,  carbon 
adsorption  is  an  appropriate  control  technology  for  control  of  emissions  from  tail  gas  treatment 
and  distillation  column  vents.  The  control  technique  applicable  to  process  equipment  leak 
emissions  is  an  inspection/maintenance  program  for  pumps,  valves,  and  flanges.  Internal 
floating  roof  tanks  may  be  used  to  control  benzene  emissions  resulting  from  benzene  storage.19

5 . 8  LINEAR  ALKYLBENZENE  PRODUCTION 

Approximately  2  percent  of  the  benzene  produced  in  the  United  States  is  used  in 
the  production  of  linear  alkylbenzene  (LAB).  LAB  (or  linear  alkylate)  improves  the  surfactant 
performance  of  detergents.  The  primary  end  use  for  LAB  is  in  the  production  of  linear 
alkylbenzene  sulfonates  (LAS).  Because  of  their  water-soluble  properties,  LAS  are  used 
extensively  in  powdered  home  laundry  products  (over  50  percent  of  LAS  produced)  and  in 
heavy-duty  liquid  products." 

Alkyl  benzene  sulfonates  with  highly  branched  C12  side  chains  possess  excellent 
detergent  properties,  and  they  have  also  been  used  in  the  past  in  formulating  detergents. 
However,  in  recent  years,  LAS  have  essentially  replaced  all  branched  alkylbenzene  sulfonates 
in  detergent  formulations  in  the  United  States  because  of  environmental  considerations.  LAB 
is  extensively  degraded  ( >  90  percent)  by  microorganisms  in  sewage  plants  after  a  relatively 
short  period  of  time.  In  comparison,  the  highly  branched  alkyl  benzene  sulfonates  have  a 
much  lower  biological  degradability.100  Dodecylbenzene  and  tridecylbenzene  are  the  two  most 
common  LABs.  The  locations  of  the  LAB  producers  in  the  United  States  are  shown  in 
Table  5-13. 1U01 


In  the  United  States,  LAB  is  produced  using  two  different  processes.  Vista's 
Baltimore  plant  uses  a  monochloroparaffin  LAB  production  process.  Vista's  Lake  Charles 
plant  and  Monsanto's  Alvin  plant  use  an  olefin  process,  wherein  hydrogen  fluoride  serves  as  a 
catalyst.  Approximately  64  percent  of  LAB  is  produced  by  the  olefm  process.  The  paraffin 
chlorination  process  accounts  for  about  36  percent  of  LAB  production.  Both  processes  are 
described  in  the  following  sections. 

5.8.1  Process  Description  for  Production  of  LAB  Using  the  Olefin  Process 

Production  of  LAB  using  the  olefin  process  consists  of  two  steps:  a 
dehydrogenation  reaction  and  an  alkylation  reaction.  The  C10  to  C14  linear  paraffins  are

changes,  or  plants  are  closed  down.  The  reader  should  verify  the  existence  of  particular  facilities  by  consulting  current  listings  or  the  plants 
themselves.  The  level  of  emissions  from  any  given  facility  is  a  function  of  variables,  such  as  throughput  and  control  measures,  and  should  be 
determined  through  direct  contacts  with  plant  personnel.  These  data  for  producers  and  locations  were  current  as  of  January  1993. 


dehydrogenated  to  n-olefins,  which  are  reacted  with  benzene  under  the  influence  of  a  solid, 
heterogenous  catalyst  (such  as  hydrogen  fluoride  [HF1])  to  form  LAB.  The  discussion  of  LAB 
production  using  the  olefm  process  is  taken  from  references  102  and  103. 

First,  n-paraffms  are  transferred  from  bulk  storage  to  the  linear  paraffin  feed 
tank  in  Stream  1  (Figure  5- 15.) 103  The  paraffins  are  heated  to  the  point  of  vaporization 
(Stream  2)  and  passed  through  a  catalyst  bed  in  the  Pacol  reactor  (Stream  3),  where  the  feed  is 
dehydrogenated  to  form  the  corresponding  linear  olefins  by  the  following  reaction: 

R,  -  CH2  -  CH2  -  R2  — >  Rj  CH  =  CH  -  R2  +  H2 

The  resulting  olefins  contain  from  10  to  30  percent  a-olefms,  and  a  mixture  of  internal  olefms, 
unreacted  paraffins,  some  diolefins,  and  lower-molecular-weight  “cracked  materials.”  The  gas 
mixture  is  quickly  quenched  with  a  cold  liquid  stream  as  it  exits  to  process  thermally-promoted 
side  reactions  (Stream  4).  The  hydrogen-rich  offgases  (e.g.,  hydrogen,  methane,  ethane,  etc.) 
are  then  separated  from  the  olefin  liquid  phases  (Stream  5).  The  gas  is  used  as  process  fuel 
(Stream  6)  or  vented  to  a  flare  stack. 

Di-olefins  in  the  Pacol  separator  liquid  are  selectively  converted  back  to 
mono-olefins  in  the  Define  reactor  (Stream  7).  The  effluent  from  the  reactor  is  routed  to  a 
stripper  (Stream  8),  where  light  ends  are  removed  (Stream  9).  The  olefin-paraffin  mixture 
(Stream  10)  is  then  alkylated  with  benzene  (Stream  11)  in  the  fixed-bed  reactor  to  be  blended 
with  a  HF1  catalyst.  The  blend  is  held  at  reaction  conditions  long  enough  for  the  alkylation 
reaction  to  go  to  completion  as  follows: 

R,CH  =  CHR2  +  C6H6  —  >  RtCH2  -  CHR2 

Product  from  the  reactor  flows  to  the  benzene  stripping  column  (Stream  12)  for  separation  and 
recycle  of  unreacted  benzene  to  the  fixed-bed  reactor  (Stream  13).  The  liquid  HF1  is  also 
separated  and  recycled  to  the  alkylation  vessel  to  be  mixed  with  fresh  HF1.

Figure  5-15.  Linear  Alkybenzene  Production  Using  the  Olefin  Process 


Following  benzene  stripping,  a  lime  water  solution  is  then  fed  into  the  HF1 
scrubber  column  (Stream  14)  to  neutralize  the  HF1.  The  solution  is  filtered  (Stream  15);  the 
wastewater  is  routed  to  the  treatment  facility  and  the  solids  are  transferred  to  a  landfill. 
Unreacted  paraffins  are  separated  in  the  paraffin  stripping  column  (Stream  16)  and  recycled  to 
the  Pacol  reactor  (Stream  17).  The  last  distillation  column  purifies  the  main  LAB  (Stream  18). 
Heavy  alkylate  byproducts  are  stored  (Stream  19)  and  the  pure  LAB  is  transferred  to  storage 
tanks  (Stream  20)  awaiting  sale. 

5.8.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  LAB  Production  Using  the  Olefin  Process 

Benzene  emissions  from  the  LAB  olefin  process  are  shown  in  Table  5-14. 102 
The  two  major  sources  of  emissions  are  the  benzene  azeotropic  column  (Vent  A)  and  the  HF1 
scrubber  column  controlling  emissions  from  the  benzene  stripping  column  (Vent  B).  Some 
benzene  can  be  emitted  through  the  HF1  scrubber  column.  Inert  gases  and  air  venting  from  the 
unit,  temperature,  and  purge  rate  of  the  scrubber  can  influence  the  amount  of  volatiles  emitted. 
These  gases  are  usually  sent  to  a  flare.  The  control  for  both  of  these  emissions  is  use  as  fuel. 
Benzene  emissions  can  also  occur  from  benzene  storage  tanks  and  equipment  leaks.  Refer  to 
Section  4.5  for  a  discussion  of  benzene  emissions  from  these  sources. 

5.8.3  Process  Description  for  Production  of  LAB  Using  the  Chlorination  Process 

The  LAB  chlorination  process  consists  of  two  sequential  reactions.  In  the  first 
step,  n-paraffins  are  chlorinated  to  monochlorinated  n-paraffins.  In  the  second  reaction, 
benzene  and  crude  secondary  alkyl  chlorides  (chloroparaffins)  are  blended  with  an  aluminum 
chloride  catalyst  to  form  crude  LAB.  The  following  discussion  of  LAB  production  using  the 
chlorination  process  is  taken  from  references  100  and  102. 

As  shown  in  Figure  5-16,  n-paraffins  (alkanes)  (Stream  1)  are  reacted  with 
liquid  chlorine  (Stream  2)  in  a  series  of  UV-catalyzed  chlorination  reactors.100  The  n-paraffins

Figure  5-16.  Production  of  Linear  Alkybenzenes  via  Chlorination 


are  converted  at  212°F  (100°C)  to  a  mixture  of  about  35  percent  chlorinated  paraffins,  and  the 
remainder  to  paraffins  and  HC1  as  shown  in  the  following  reaction: . 


Ri  -  CH2  -  R2  +  Cl  — >  R  -  CH  -  R2  +  HC1  +  heat 

Cl 

Following  this  reaction,  dehydrochlorination  (elimination  of  HC1)  of  the  monochloroalkanes 
takes  place  at  392  to  752  °F  (200  to  300 °C)  over  an  iron  catalyst  to  form  olefins  (linear  alkenes 
with  internal  double  bonds)  (Stream  3).  It  is  necessary  to  remove  all  chlorinated  paraffins 
(such  as  dichloroalkenes)  from  the  process  stream  because  they  form  other  products  besides 
LAB.  Therefore,  the  remaining  chlorinated  paraffins  are  dehydrochlorinated  to  give  tar-like 
products  that  are  easily  separated  and  recycled  back  to  the  reactor  (Stream  4).  HC1  is  also 
removed  from  the  mixture  (Stream  5),  leaving  a  mixture  of  only  olefins  and  paraffins  for  the 
alkylation  reaction.100 

This  olefin-paraffin  mixture  (Stream  6)  is  combined  with  benzene  from  storage 
that  has  been  dried  in  a  benzene  azeotropic  column  (Stream  7).  These  two  streams  are 
combined  in  an  alkylation  reactor  with  an  aluminum  chloride  catalyst  at  122  °F  (50  °C) 

(Stream  8).  The  subsequent  reaction  produces  LAB,  illustrated  below: 

R j  -  CH  -  R;  +  C6H6  — >  Rj  -  CH  -  R2  +  HC1  +  heat,  possible  olefins, 

short-chained  paraffins,  etc. 

Cl 


At  this  point,  HC1  gas  and  some  fugitive  volatile  organics  given  off  during  the 
reaction  are  treated  with  adsorbers  and  excess  HC1  is  routed  to  storage  (Vent  B).  Next,  the 
LAB  (Stream  9)  is  routed  to  a  separator  where  hydrolysis  is  performed  in  the  presence  of  HF1 
at  50°F  (10°C)  to  separate  crude  LAB  and  the  organics  (benzene,  tar,  etc.)  (Stream  10)  from 
the  catalyst  sludge  (Stream  11).  Benzene  is  recovered  in  the  benzene  stripping  column  and 
recycled  back  to  the  reactor  (Stream  12). 


5-77 


The  resulting  paraffin-alkylate  mixture  (Stream  13)  is  sent  through  rectification 
and  purification  (which  includes  washing  and  decanting)  to  yield  pure  alkylbenzene  and 
paraffin,  which  can  be  recycled  as  feedstock.100 

5.8.4  Benzene  Emissions  from  LAB  Production  Using  the  Chlorination  Process 

Benzene  emissions  using  the  LAB  chlorination  process  are  shown  in  Table  5-14. 
The  four  major  points  of  benzene  emissions  are  listed  below.  Emission  factors  for  these  points 
also  are  presented  in  Table  5-15. 102 

One  emission  point  is  the  benzene  azeotropic  column  vent,  which  serves  to  dry 
the  benzene  before  it  enters  the  alkylation  reactor.  Some  benzene  emissions  can  escape  from 
the  vent  in  the  column  (Vent  A).  The  quantity  of  escaping  emissions  is  dependent  on  the 
dryness  of  the  benzene  and  the  design  of  the  column  condenser. 

A  second  emission  point  is  the  hydrochloric  acid  adsorber  vent.  Following  the 
alkylation  reaction,  the  HC1  gas  and  fugitive  volatile  organics  are  treated  by  absorbers.  Most 
of  the  product  goes  to  hydrochloric  acid  storage,  but  some  is  vented  off  (Vent  B).  The  amount 
of  benzene  emissions  given  off  here  is  dependent  on  the  fluid  temperature  in  the  absorber  and 
the  vapor  pressure  of  the  mixed  absorber  fluid. 

The  third  type  of  emission  point  is  the  atmospheric  wash  decanter  vents.  In  the 
final  purification/rectification  stage,  the  crude  LAB  is  washed  with  alkaline  water  to  neutralize 
it.  Benzene  emissions  can  escape  from  these  atmospheric  washer  vents  (Vent  C). 

Finally,  in  the  benzene  stripping  column,  benzene  is  recovered  and  returned  to 
the  benzene  feed  tank.  Residual  inert  gases  and  benzene  emissions  can  occur  at  this  point 
(Vent  D).  The  amount  of  benzene  in  the  stream  depends  on  the  quantity  of  inert  gases  and  the 
temperature  and  design  of  the  reflux  condenser  used.

contact  plant  personnel  to  confirm  the  existence  of  emitting  operations  and  control  technology  at  a  particular  facility  prior  to  estimating  emissions 
therefrom. 


The  most  frequently  applied  control  option  for  all  of  these  sources  is  to  use  the 
emissions  for  fuel. 

5 . 9  OTHER  ORGANIC  CHEMICAL  PRODUCTION 

Several  additional  organic  chemicals  that  are  produced  using  benzene  as  a 
feedstock  are  believed  to  have  benzene  emissions.  These  chemicals  include  hydroquinone, 
benzophenone,  benzene  sulfonic  acid,  resorcinol,  biphenyl,  and  anthraquinone.68  A  brief 
summary  of  the  producers,  end  uses,  and  manufacturing  processes  for  these  chemicals  is  given 
below.  No  emissions  data  were  available  for  these  processes. 

5.9.1  Hvdroquinone 

The  primary  end  use  of  hydroquinone  is  in  developing  black-and-white 
photographic  film  (46  percent).  A  secondary  end  use  is  as  a  raw  material  for  rubber 
antioxidants  (31  percent).104 

A  technical  grade  of  hydroquinone  is  manufactured  using  benzene  and  propylene 
as  raw  materials  by  Goodyear  Tire  and  Rubber  Company  in  Bayport,  TX,11  million  lb/yr 
(5  million  kg/yr)  and  by  the  Eastman  Chemical  Company,  Tennessee  Eastman  Division,  in 
Kingsport,  Tennessee,  26  million  lb/yr  (12  million  kg/yr).11,101 

In  this  process,  benzene  and  recycled  cumene  are  alkylated  with  propylene  in 
the  liquid  phase  over  a  fixed-bed  silica-alumina  catalyst  to  form  a  mixture  of 
diisopropylbenzene  isomers.  The  meta  isomer  is  transalkylated  with  benzene  over  a  fixed  bed 
silica-alumina  catalyst  to  produce  cumene  for  recycle.  The  para  isomer  is  hydroperoxidized  in 
the  liquid  phase,  using  gaseous  oxygen,  to  a  mixture  of  diisopropylbenzene  hydroperoxide 
isomers.  The  mono  isomer  is  recycled  to  the  hydroperoxidation  reactor.  The 
diisopropylbenzene  hydroperoxide  is  cleaved  in  the  liquid  phase  with  sulfuric  acid  to 
hydroquinone  and  acetone.  Acetone  is  produced  as  a  co-product.104 


5-80 


5.9.2 


Benzophenone 


Benzophenone  (diphenylketone)  is  used  as  an  intermediate  in  organic  synthesis, 
and  as  an  odor  fixative.  Derivatives  are  used  as  ultraviolet  (UV)  absorbers,  such  as  in  the  UV 
curing  of  inks  and  coatings.105  Benzophenone  is  also  used  as  flavoring,  soap  fragrance,  in 
pharmaceuticals,  and  as  a  polymerization  inhibitor  for  styrene.  Nickstadt-Moeller,  Inc.,  in 
Ridgefield,  New  Jersey,  and  PMC,  Inc.,  PMC  Specialties  Group  Division  in  Chicago,  Illinois, 
produce  a  technical  grade  of  benzophenone.11  Benzophenone  is  also  produced  by  Upjohn 
Company,  Fine  Chemicals.101  Benzophenone  is  produced  by  acylation  of  benzene  and  benzyl 
chloride.68 

5.9.3  Benzene  Sulfonic  Acid 


Benzene  sulfonic  acid  is  used  as  a  catalyst  for  furan  and  phenolic  resins  and  as  a 
chemical  intermediate  in  various  organic  syntheses  including  the  manufacture  of  phenol  and 
resorcinol.105,106  Benzene  sulfonic  acid  is  manufactured  by  sulfonation—reacting  benzene  with 
fuming  sulfuric  acid.106  Burroughs  Wellcome  in  Greenville,  North  Carolina;  CL  Industries, 
Inc.,  in  Georgetown,  Illinois;  and  Sloss  Industries  Corporation  in  Birmingham,  Alabama, 
produce  benzene  sulfonic  acid.11 

5.9.4  Resorcinol 


Resorcinol  is  produced  by  INDSPEC  Chemical  Corporation  in  Petrolia, 
Pennsylvania.11  Resorcinol  is  produced  by  fusing  benzene-m-disulfonic  acid  with  sodium 
hydroxide.  Resorcinol  is  used  in  manufacturing  resorcinol-formaldehyde  resins,  dyes,  and 
pharmaceuticals.  It  is  also  used  as  a  cross-linking  agent  for  neoprene,  as  a  rubber  tackifier,  in 
adhesives  for  wood  veneers  and  runner-to-textiles  composites,  and  in  the  manufacture  of 
styphnic  acid  and  cosmetics.106 


5-81 


5.9.5 


Biphenvl 


Biphenyl  (diphenyl  or  phenylbenzene)  is  produced  by  Chemol  Co.  in 
Greensboro,  North  Carolina;  Koch  Refining  Co.  in  Corpus  Christi,  Texas;  Monsanto  Co.  in 
Anniston,  Alabama;  Sybron  Chemical  Inc.,  in  Wellford,  South  Carolina;  and  Chevron 
Chemical  Co.  of  Chevron  Corp. 11,101  One  method  for  producing  biphenyl  is  by 
dehydrogenation-slowly  passing  benzene  through  a  red-hot  iron  tube. 106 

Biphenyl  is  used  in  organic  synthesis,  as  a  heat-transfer  agent,  as  a  fungistat  in 
packaging  citrus  fruit,  in  plant  disease  control,  in  the  manufacture  of  benzidine,  and  as  a 
dyeing  assistant  for  polyesters.106  In  1991,  8,976  tons  (8,143  Mg)  of  biphenyl  were  sold.101 

5.9.6  Anthraquinone 

Anthraquinone  is  manufactured  by  heating  phthalic  anhydride  and  benzene  in  the 
presence  of  aluminum  chloride  and  dehydrating  the  product.  Anthraquinone  is  used  as  an 
intermediate  for  dyes  and  organics,  as  an  organic  inhibitor,  and  as  a  bird  repellent  for  seeds. 

5.10  BENZENE  USE  AS  A  SOLVENT 

Benzene  has  been  used  historically  as  an  industrial  solvent.  Because  benzene  is 
readily  soluble  in  a  variety  of  chemicals  (including  alcohol,  ether,  and  acetone),  it  has 
commonly  been  used  as  an  agent  to  dissolve  other  substances.  As  an  industrial  solvent, 
benzene  application  has  included  use  as  an  azeotropic  agent,  distilling  agent,  reaction  solvent, 
extracting  solvent,  and  recrystallizing  agent.  However,  benzene  use  as  an  industrial  solvent 
has  been  steadily  declining  over  the  last  few  years  because  of  its  adverse  health  effects  and 
increased  regulation.  The  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  has  cited  health  risk 
to  workers  from  exposure  to  benzene,  and  EPA  has  classified  benzene  as  a  Group  A  chemical, 
a  known  human  carcinogen.107 


5-82 


Source  categories  that  currently  use  benzene  as  a  solvent  include  pharmaceutical 
manufacturing;  general  organic  synthesis;  alcohol  manufacturing;  caprolactam  production,  and 
plastics,  resins,  and  synthetic  rubber  manufacturing.  Benzene  is  also  used  in  small  quantities 
(generally  less  than  0.1  percent)  in  solvents  used  in  the  rubber  tire  manufacturing  industry; 
however,  the  amount  of  emissions  generated  is  variable  depending  on  the  amount  of  solvent 
used.108 

Facilities  in  the  above-listed  source  categories  indicate  that  they  plan  to 
eliminate  benzene  solvent  use  in  the  next  few  years.107  Facilities  have  been  experimenting  with 
substimtes,  such  as  toluene,  cyclohexane,  and  monochlorobenzene.  However,  those  facilities 
that  continue  to  use  benzene  indicate  that  they  have  been  unable  to  identify  a  solvent  substitute 

as  effective  as  benzene.109 

Several  facilities  in  the  source  categories  listed  above  reported  benzene 
emissions  in  the  1992  TRI.  These  facilities  and  their  locations  are  included  in  Table  5-16. 

Emissions  of  benzene  from  solvent  used  in  the  manufacture  and  use  of 
pesticides,  use  of  printing  inks,  application  of  surface  coatings,  and  manufacture  of  paints  are 
believed  to  be  on  the  decline  or  discontinued.107110  However,  several  facilities  in  these  source 
categories  reported  benzene  emissions  in  the  1992  TRI.111  These  facilities  and  their  locations 
are  also  included  in  Table  5-16. 11  * 

Benzene  continues  to  be  used  in  alcohol  manufacture  as  a  denaturant  for  ethyl 
alcohol.  It  is  also  used  as  an  azeotropic  agent  for  dehydration  of  95  percent  ethanol  and 
91  percent  isoproponal.109  Companies  currently  producing  these  alcohols  are  presented  in 
Table  5-17. lun 

Benzene  is  also  used  as  a  solvent  to  extract  crude  caprolactam.112  The  three 
major  caprolactam  facilities  currently  operating  in  the  United  States  are  listed  in

SECTION  6.0 

EMISSIONS  FROM  OTHER  SOURCES 


The  following  activities  and  manufacturing  processes  (other  than  benzene 
production  or  use  of  benzene  as  a  feedstock)  were  identified  as  additional  sources  of  benzene 
emissions:  oil  and  gas  wellheads,  petroleum  refineries,  glycol  dehydrators,  gasoline 
marketing,  publicly  owned  treatment  works  (POTWs),  landfills,  pulp  and  paper 
manufacturing,  synthetic  graphite  manufacturing,  carbon  black  manufacturing,  rayon-based 
carbon  manufacturing,  aluminum  casting,  asphalt  roofing  manufacturing,  and  use  of  consumer 
products  and  building  supplies. 

For  each  of  these  categories,  the  following  information  is  provided  in  the 
sections  below:  (1)  a  description  of  the  activity  or  process,  (2)  a  brief  characterization  of  the 
national  activity  in  the  United  States,  (3)  benzene  emissions  characteristics,  and  (4)  control 
technologies  and  techniques  for  reducing  benzene  emissions.  In  some  cases,  the  current 
Federal  regulations  applicable  to  the  source  category  are  discussed. 

6.1  OIL  AND  GAS  WELLHEADS 

6.1.1  Description  of  Oil  and  Gas  Wellheads 

Oil  and  gas  production  (through  wellheads)  delivers  a  stream  of  oil  and  gas 
mixture  and  leads  to  equipment  leak  emissions.  Emissions  from  the  oil  and  gas  wellheads. 


6-1 


including  benzene,  are  primarily  the  result  of  equipment  leaks  from  various  components  at  the 
wellheads  (valves,  flanges,  connections,  and  open-ended  lines).  Component  configurations  for 
wellheads  can  vary  significantly. 

Oil  and  gas  well  population  data  are  tracked  by  State  and  Federal  agencies, 
private  oil  and  gas  consulting  firms,  and  oil  and  gas  trade  associations.  In  1989  a  total  of 
262,483  gas  wells  and  310,046  oil  wells  were  reported  in  the  United  States. 115,1 16 
Reference  1 17  presents  a  comprehensive  review  of  information  sources  for  oil  and  gas  well 
count  data.  The  activity  factor  data  are  presented  at  four  levels  of  resolution:  (1)  number  of 
wells  by  county,  (2)  number  of  wells  by  State,  (3)  number  of  fields  by  county,  and  (4)  number 
of  fields  by  State. 

6.1.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Oil  and  Gas  Wellheads 

Emissions  from  oil  and  gas  wellheads  can  be  estimated  using  the  average 
emission  factor  approach  as  indicated  in  the  EPA  Protocol  for  Equipment  Leak  Emission 
Estimates.54  This  approach  allows  the  use  of  average  emission  factors  in  combination  with 
wellheads-specific  data.  These  data  include:  (1)  number  of  each  type  of  components  (valves, 
flanges,  etc.),  (2)  the  service  type  of  each  component  (gas,  condensate,  mixture,  etc.),  (3)  the 
benzene  concentration  of  the  stream,  and  (4)  the  number  of  wells. 

A  main  source  of  data  for  equipment  leak  hydrocarbon  emission  factors  for  oil 
and  gas  field  operations  is  an  API  study118  developed  in  1980. 

Average  gas  wellhead  component  count  has  been  reported  as  consisting  of 
11  valves,  50  screwed  connections,  1  flange,  and  2  open-ended  lines.119  No  information  was 
found  concerning  average  component  counts  for  oil  wellheads. 

Benzene  and  total  hydrocarbons  equipment  leak  emission  factors  from  oil 
wellheads  are  presented  in  Table  6-1. 120  These  emission  factors  were  developed  from

Field  wellhead  only.  Does  not  include  other  field  equipment  (such  as  dehydrators,  separators,  inline  heaters,  treaters,  etc. 


screening  and  bagging  data  obtained  in  oil  production  facilities  located  in  California. 120  Over 
450  accessible  production  wellhead  assemblies  were  screened,  and  a  total  of  28  wellhead 
assemblies  were  selected  for  bagging.  For  information  about  screening  and  bagging 
procedures  refer  to  Reference  54. 

The  composition  of  gas  streams  varies  among  production  sites.  Therefore, 
when  developing  benzene  emission  estimates,  the  total  hydrocarbons  emission  factors  should 
be  modified  by  specific  benzene  weight  percent,  if  available. 

Benzene  constituted  from  less  than  0.1  up  to  2.3  percent  weight  of  total 
non-methane  hydrocarbons  (TNMHC)  for  water  flood  wellhead  samples  from  old  crude  oil 
production  sites  in  Oklahoma.  Also,  benzene  constituted  approximately  0.1  percent  weight  of 
TNMHC  for  gas  driven  wellhead  samples.121  The  VOC  composition  in  the  gas  stream  from 
old  production  sites  is  different  than  that  from  a  new  field.  Also,  the  gas-to-oil  ratio  for  old 
production  sites  may  be  relatively  low.121  The  above  type  of  situations  should  be  analyzed 
before  using  available  emission  factors. 

6.2  GLYCOL  DEHYDRATION  UNITS 

Glycol  dehydrators  used  in  the  petroleum  and  natural  gas  industries  have  only 
recently  been  discovered  to  be  an  important  source  of  volatile  organic  compound  (VOC) 
emissions,  including  benzene,  toluene,  ethylbenzene,  and  xylene  (BTEX).  Natural  gas  is 
typically  dehydrated  in  glycol  dehydration  units.  The  removal  of  water  from  natural  gas  may 
take  place  in  field  production,  treatment  facilities,  and  in  gas  processing  plants.  Glycol 
dehydration  units  in  field  production  service  have  smaller  gas  throughputs  compared  with  units 
in  gas  processing  service.  It  has  been  estimated  that  between  30,000  and  40,000  glycol 
dehydrating  units  are  in  operation  in  the  United  States.122  In  a  survey  conducted  by  the 
Louisiana  Department  of  Environmental  Quality,  triethylene  glycol  (TEG)  dehydration  units 
accounted  for  approximately  95  percent  of  the  total  in  the  United  States,  with  ethylene  glycol 
(EG)  and  diethylene  glycol  (DEG)  dehydration  units  accounting  for  approximately  5  percent.123 


6-4 


Data  on  the  population  and  characteristics  of  glycol  dehydration  units 
nationwide  is  limited.  Demographic  data  has  been  collected  by  Louisiana  Department  of 
Environmental  Quality,  Texas  Mid-Continent  Oil  and  Gas  Association  and  Gas  Processors 
Association,  Air  Quality  Service  of  the  Oklahoma  Department  of  Health  (assisted  by  the 
Oklahoma  Mid-Continent  Oil  and  Gas  Association),  and  Air  Quality  Division  of  the  Wyoming 
Department  of  Environmental  Quality.124  Table  6-2  presents  population  data  and 
characteristics  of  glycol  dehydration  units  currently  available.124 

6.2.1  Process  Description  for  Glvcol  Dehydration  Units 

The  two  basic  unit  operations  occurring  in  a  glycol  dehydration  unit  are 
absorption  and  distillation.  Figure  6-1  presents  a  general  flow  diagram  for  a  glycol 
dehydration  unit.125  The  “wet”  natural  gas  (Stream  1)  enters  the  glycol  dehydrator  through  an 
inlet  separator  that  removes  produced  water  and  liquid  hydrocarbons.  The  gas  flows  into  the 
bottom  of  an  absorber  (Stream  2),  where  it  comes  in  contact  with  the  “lean”  glycol  (usually 
triethylene  glycol  [TEG]).  The  water  and  some  hydrocarbons  in  the  gas  are  absorbed  by  the 
glycol.  The  “dry”  gas  passes  overhead  from  the  absorber  through  a  gas/glycol  exchanger 
(Stream  3),  where  it  cools  the  incoming  lean  glycol.  The  gas  may  enter  a  knock-out  drum 
(Stream  4),  where  any  residual  glycol  is  removed.  From  there,  the  dry  natural  gas  goes 
downstream  for  further  processing  or  enters  the  pipeline. 

After  absorbing  water  from  the  gas  in  the  absorber,  the  “rich”  glycol  (Stream  5) 
is  preheated,  usually  in  the  still,  and  the  pressure  of  the  glycol  is  dropped  before  it  enters  a 
three-phase  separator  (Stream  6).  The  reduction  in  pressure  produces  a  flash  gas  stream  from 
the  three-phase  separator.  Upon  exiting  the  separator  (Stream  7),  the  glycol  is  filtered  to 
remove  panicles.  This  particular  configuration  of  preheat,  flash,  and  filter  steps  may  vary 
from  unit  to  unit.  The  rich  glycol  (Stream  8)  then  passes  through  a  glycol/glycol  exchanger 
for  further  preheating  before  it  enters  the  reboiler  still.

Then,  the  rich  glycol  enters  the  reboiler  still  (Stream  9)  (operating  at 
atmospheric  pressure),  where  the  water  and  hydrocarbons  are  distilled  (stripped)  from  the 
glycol  making  it  lean.  The  lean  glycol  is  pumped  back  to  absorber  pressure  and  sent  to  the 
gas/glycol  exchanger  (Stream  10)  before  entering  the  absorber  to  complete  the  loop. 

6.2.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Glvcol  Dehydration  Units 

The  primary  source  of  VOC  emissions,  including  BTEX,  from  glycol 
dehydration  units  is  the  reboiler  still  vent  stack  (Vent  A). 

Because  the  boiling  points  of  BTEX  range  from  176°F  to  284°F  (80  to  140°C), 
they  are  not  lost  to  any  large  extent  in  the  flash  tank  but  are  separated  from  the  glycol  in  the 
still.  These  separations  in  the  still  result  in  VOC  emissions  that  contain  significant  quantities 
of  BTEX.126 


Secondary  sources  of  emissions  from  glycol  dehydration  units  are  the  phase 
separator  vent  (Vent  B)  and  the  reboiler  burner  exhaust  stack  (Vent  C). 

Most  glycol  units  have  a  phase  separator  between  the  absorber  and  the  still  to 
remove  dissolved  gases  from  the  warm  rich  glycol  and  reduce  VOC  emissions  from  the  still. 
The  gas  produced  from  the  phase  separator  can  provide  the  fuel  and/or  stripping  gas  required 
for  the  reboiler. 

A  large  number  of  small  glycol  dehydration  units  use  a  gas-fired  burner  as  the 
heat  source  for  the  reboiler.  The  emissions  from  the  burner  exhaust  stack  are  considered 
minimal  and  are  typical  of  natural  gas  combustion  sources. 

Reboiler  still  vent  data  have  been  collected  by  the  Louisiana  Department  of 
Environmental  Quality,123  and  the  Ventura  County  (California)  Air  Pollution  Control 
District.127  Table  6-3  presents  emission  factors  for  both  triethylene  glycol  (TEG)  units  and

ethylene  glycol  (EG)  units  based  on  the  natural  gas  throughput  of  the  gas  treated.  The 
emission  factors  developed  from  the  LDEQ  study  were  based  on  responses  from  41  companies 
and  208  glycol  dehydration  units.  The  Ventura  County,  California,  factors  include  testing 
results  at  two  locations  (one  for  TEG  and  one  for  EG).  The  amount  of  produced  gas  treated  is 
thought  to  be  the  most  important  because  it  largely  determines  the  size  of  the  glycol  system.127 
However,  the  data  base  does  not  show  a  strong  correlation  because  other  variables  with 
countervailing  influences  were  not  constant.127  VOC  and  BTEX  emissions  from  glycol  units 
vary  depending  upon  the  inlet  feed  composition  (gas  composition  and  water  content)  as  well  as 
the  configuration,  size,  and  operating  conditions  of  the  glycol  unit  (i.e.,  glycol  type,  pump 
type  and  circulation  rate,  gas  and  contactor  temperatures,  reboiler  fire-cycles,  and  inlet 
scrubber  flash  tank  efficiencies).129 

The  speciation  of  Total  BTEX  for  TEG  units  reported  by  the  LDEQ  in  their 
study  indicated  the  following  composition  (%  weight):  benzene  (35);  toluene  (36); 
ethylbenzene  (5);  and  xylene  (24).  For  EG  units,  the  following  compositions  were  reported: 
benzene  (48);  toluene  (30);  ethylbenzene  (4);  and  xylene  (17).  Note  that  the  BTEX 
composition  of  natural  gas  may  vary  according  to  geographic  areas.  Limited  information/data 
on  the  BTEX  composition  is  available. 

Four  methods  for  estimating  emissions  have  been  reported  for  glycol 
dehydration  units:  (1)  rich/lean  glycol  mass  balance,  (2)  inlet/outlet  gas  mass  balance, 

(3)  unconventional  stack  measurements  (total-capture  condensation,  and  partial  stack 
condensation/flow  measurement),  and  (4)  direct  stack  measurements  (conventional  stack 
measurements,  and  novel  stack  composition/flow  measurement).129 

Sampling  of  the  rich/lean  glycol  then  estimating  emissions  using  mass  balance 
has  been  the  selected  method  for  measuring  emissions  to  date.  The  Louisiana  Department  of 
Environmental  Quality  requested  emission  estimates  using  reboiler  mass  balances  on  the 
rich/lean  glycol  samples. 


6-10 


Based  upon  a  set  of  studies  conducted  by  Oryx  Energy  Co  as  part  of  a  task  force 
for  the  Oklahoma-Kansas  Midcontinent  Oil  &  Gas  Association,  rich/lean  glycol  mass  balance 
is  a  highly  convenient,  cost  effective  method  for  estimating  air  emissions  from  glycol 
dehydration  units.129  The  following  conclusions  were  addressed  in  reference  129  regarding  this 
method:  (a)  good  estimates  of  BTEX  can  be  obtained  from  rich/lean  glycol  mass  balance, 

(b)  the  rich/lean  glycol  mass  balance  BTEX  estimates  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  total 
capture  condensation  method,  and  (c)  rich/lean  glycol  mass  balance  is  a  more  reproducible 
method  for  emission  estimations  than  nonconventional  stack  methods.  Note  that  conventional 
stack  methods  cannot  be  used  on  the  stacks  of  glycol  dehydration  units  because  they  are  too 
narrow  in  diameter  and  have  low  flow  rates. 

An  industry  working  group  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  American 
Petroleum  Institute,  Gas  Processors  Association,  Texas-Midcontinent  Oil  &  Gas  Association, 
Louisiana  Mid-Continent  Oil  and  Gas  Association,  and  GRI  is  conducting  field  evaluation 
experiments  to  determine  appropriate  and  accurate  sampling  and  analytical  methods  to  calculate 
glycol  dehydration  unit  emissions.125  GRI  has  developed  a  computer  tool,  entitled 
GRI-GLYCalc,  for  estimating  emissions  from  glycol  dehydrators.  The  U.S.  EPA  has 
performed  their  own  field  study  of  GRI-GLYCalc  and  has  recommended  that  it  be  included  in 
EPA  guidance  for  State/local  agency  use  for  development  of  emission  inventories.130 

Atmospheric  rich/lean  glycol  sampling  is  being  evaluated  as  a  screening 
technique  in  the  above  working  group  program.  The  goal  is  to  compare  these  results  to  the 
stack  and  other  rich/lean  results  and  determine  if  a  correction  factor  can  be  applied  to  this 
approach.125 


A  second  screening  technique  under  study  is  natural  gas  sampling  and  analysis 
combined  with  the  software  program  GRI-GLYCalc®  to  predict  emissions.  Table  6-4  shows 
the  inputs  required  of  the  user  and  also  shows  the  outputs  returned  by  GRI-GLYCalc®.132

Controls  and  Regulatory  Analysis 


Controls  applicable  to  glycol  dehydrator  reboiler  still  vents  include  hydrocarbon 
skimmers,  condensation,  flaring,  and  incineration.  Hydrocarbon  skimmers  use  a  three-phase 
separator  to  recover  gas  and  hydrocarbons  from  the  liquid  glycol  prior  to  its  injection  into  the 
reboiler.  Condensation  recovers  hydrocarbons  from  the  still  vent  emissions,  whereas  flaring 
and  incineration  destroy  the  hydrocarbons  present  in  the  still  vent  emissions. 

For  glycol  dehydrators  it  has  been  determined  by  the  Air  Quality  Service, 
Oklahoma  State  Department  of  Health  that  the  Best  Available  Control  Technology  (BACT) 
could  include  one  or  more  of  the  following:  (1)  substitution  of  glycol,  (2)  definition  of  specific 
operational  parameters,  such  as  the  glycol  circulation  rate,  reduction  of  contactor  tower 
temperature,  or  increasing  temperature  in  the  three-phase  separator,  (3)  flaring/incineration, 

(4)  product/vapor  recovery,  (5)  pressurized  tanks,  (6)  carbon  adsorption,  or  (7)  change  of 
desiccant  system.128 

The  Air  Quality  Division,  Wyoming  Department  of  Environmental  Quality  has 
stated  that  facilities  will  more  than  likely  be  required  to  control  emissions  from  glycol 
dehydration  units.  The  Division  has  determined  and  will  accept  the  use  of  condensers  in 
conjunction  with  a  vapor  recovery  system,  incinerator,  or  a  flare  as  representing  BACT.133 

Most  gas  processors  have  begun  to  modify  existing  glycol  reboiler  equipment  to 
reduce  or  eliminate  VOC  emissions.  Some  strategies  and  experiences  from  one  natural  gas 
company  are  presented  in  Reference  124.  For  other  control  technologies  refer  to 
Reference  134. 

Glycol  dehydration  units  are  subject  to  the  NSPS  for  VOC  emissions  from 
equipment  leaks  for  onshore  natural  gas  processing  plants  promulgated  in  June  1985. 135  The 
NSPS  provides  requirements  for  repair  schedules,  recordkeeping,  and  reporting  of  equipment 
leaks. 


6-13 


The  Clean  Air  Act  Amendments  (CAAA)  of  1990  resulted  in  regulation  of 
glycol  dehydration  units.  Title  III  of  the  CAAA  regulates  the  emissions  of  188  hazardous  air 
pollutants  (HAPs)  from  major  sources  and  area  sources.  Title  HI  has  potentially  wide-ranging 
effects  for  glycol  units.  The  BTEX  compounds  are  included  in  the  list  of  188  HAPs  and  may 
be  emitted  at  levels  that  would  cause  many  glycol  units  to  be  defined  as  major  sources  and 
subject  to  Maximum  Achievable  Control  Technology  (MACT).125 

Currently,  the  MACT  standard  for  the  oil  and  natural  gas  production  source 
category,  which  includes  glycol  dehydration  units,  is  being  developed  under  authority  of 
Section  112(d)  of  the  1990  CAAA  and  is  scheduled  for  promulgation  in  May,  1999. 

In  addition  to  the  federal  regulations,  many  states  have  regulations  affecting 
glycol  dehydration  units.  The  State  of  Louisiana  has  already  regulated  still  vents  on  large 
glycol  units,  and  its  air  toxics  rule  may  affect  many  small  units.  Texas,  Oklahoma,  Wyoming, 
and  California  are  considering  regulation  of  BTEX  and  other  VOC  emissions  from  dehydration 
units.125 

6 . 3  PETROLEUM  REFINERY  PROCESSES 

6.3.1  Description  of  Petroleum  Refineries 

Crude  oil  contains  small  amounts  of  naturally  occurring  benzene.  One  estimate 
indicates  that  crude  oil  consists  of  0.15  percent  benzene  by  volume.136  Therefore,  some 
processes  and  operations  at  petroleum  refineries  may  emit  benzene  independent  of  specific 
benzene  recovery  processes.  Appendix  B  (Table  B-l)  lists  the  locations  of  petroleum  refineries 
in  the  U.S.  As  of  January  1995,  there  were  173  operational  petroleum  refineries  in  the  United 
States,  with  a  total  crude  capacity  of  15.14  million  barrels  per  calendar  day.137,138  The  majority 
of  refinery  capacity  is  located  in  Texas,  Louisiana,  and  California.  Significant  refinery 
capacities  are  also  found  in  the  Chicago,  Philadelphia,  and  Puget  Sound  areas.  A  flow  diagram 


6-14 


of  processes  likely  to  be  found  at  a  model  refinery  is  shown  in  Figure  6-2. 139  The  arrangement 
of  these  processes  varies  among  refineries,  and  few,  if  any,  employ  all  of  these  processes. 

Processes  at  petroleum  refineries  can  be  grouped  into  five  types:  (1)  separation 
processes,  (2)  conversion  processes,  (3)  treating  processes,  (4)  auxiliary  processes  and 
operation,  and  (5)  feedstock/product  storage  and  handling.  These  are  discussed  briefly  below. 

The  first  phase  in  petroleum  refining  operations  is  the  separation  of  crude  oil 
into  its  major  constituents  using  four  separation  processes:  (1)  desalting,  (2)  atmospheric 
distillation,  (3)  vacuum  distillation,  and  (4)  light  ends  recovery. 

To  meet  the  demands  for  high-octane  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  and  diesel  fuel, 
components  such  as  residual  oils,  fuel  oils,  and  light  ends  are  converted  to  gasolines  and  other 
light  fractions  using  one  or  more  of  the  following  conversion  processes:  (1)  catalytic  cracking 
(fluidized-bed  and  moving-bed),  (2)  thermal  processes  (coking,  and  visbreaking), 

(3)  alkylation,  (4)  polymerization,  (5)  isomerization,  and  (6)  reforming. 

Petroleum  treating  processes  stabilize  and  upgrade  petroleum  products  by 
separating  them  from  less  desirable  products.  Among  the  treating  processes  are 
(1)  hydrotreating,  (2)  chemical  sweetening,  (3)  deasphalting,  and  (4)  asphalt  blowing. 

Auxiliary  processes  and  operations  include  process  heaters,  compressor  engines, 
sulfur  recovery  units,  blowdown  systems,  flares,  cooling  towers,  and  wastewater  treatment 
facilities. 


Finally,  all  refineries  have  a  feedstock/product  storage  area  (commonly  called  a 
“tank  farm”)  with  storage  tanks  whose  capacities  range  from  less  than  1,000  barrels  to  more 
than  500,000  barrels.  Also,  feedstock/product  handling  operations  (transfer  operations)  consist 
of  the  loading  and  unloading  of  transport  vehicles  (including  trucks,  rail  cars,  and  marine 
vessels).

For  a  -complete  description  of  the  various  processes  and  operations  at  petroleum 
refineries  refer  to  References  139,  140,  and  141. 

6.3.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Petroleum  Refinery  Processes  and  Operations 

Benzene  emissions,  as  well  as  Hazardous  Air  Pollutant  (HAPs)  emissions  from 
petroleum  refineries  can  be  grouped  into  five  main  categories:  (1)  process  vents,  (2)  storage 
tanks,  (3)  equipment  leaks.  (4)  transfer  operations,  and  (5)  wastewater  collection  and 
treatment.  Table  6-5  presents  a  list  of  specific  processes  and  operations  which  are  potential 
sources  of  benzene  emissions  at  petroleum  refineries  emitted  from  one  or  more  of  the  above 
categories.139 

Also,  process  heaters  and  boilers  located  at  the  different  process  units  across  a 
refinery  emit  flue  gases  containing  benzene,  and  other  HAPs.  The  HAPs  emitted  result  either 
from  incomplete  combustion  of  fuel  gas  or  from  the  combustion  products. 


According  to  the  Information  Collection  Request  (ICR)  and  Section  114  survey 
submitted  to  EPA  by  U.S.  refiners  as  part  of  the  Petroleum  Refinery  NESHAP  study,  benzene 
emissions  from  process  vents  were  reported  for  the  following  process  units  within  a  refinery: 
(1)  thermal  cracking  (coking),  (2)  Methyl  Ethyl  Ketone  (MEK)  dewaxing,  and 
(3)  miscellaneous  vents  at  crude  distillation  units,  catalytic  reforming  units, 
hydrotreating/hydrorefming,  asphalt  plants,  vacuum  distillation  towers,  and  full-range 
distillation  units  (light  ends,  naphtha,  solvent,  etc.).  Also,  benzene  emissions  were  reported 
from  blowdown  and  flue  gas  system  vents. 


The  Section  114  and  ICR  questionnaire  responses  also  provided  estimates  of 
benzene  concentrations  in  refinery  processes,  and  in  petroleum  refinery  products.  Table  6-6 
summarizes  concentrations  of  benzene  for  gas,  light  liquid,  and  heavy  liquid  streams  at  some 
refinery  process  units.142  Table  6-7  summarizes  concentrations  of  benzene  in  common  refinery 
products.143,144

Storage  tanks  at  petroleum  refineries  containing  petroleum  liquids  are  potential 
sources  for  benzene  emissions.  VOC  emissions  from  storage  tanks,  including  fixed-roof, 
external  floating-roof,  and  internal  floating-roof  types,  can  be  estimated  using  Compilation  of 
Air  Pollutant  Emission  Factors  (AP-42),  Chapter  733  and  the  TANKS  model.  Emissions  of 
benzene  from  storage  vessels  may  be  estimated  by  applying  the  benzene  concentrations  in 
Table  6-7  to  the  equations  in  AP-42  which  are  also  used  in  TANKS. 

Equipment  leak  emissions  from  refineries  occur  from  process  equipment 
components  such  as  valves,  pump  seals,  compressor  seals,  pressure  relief  valves,  connectors, 
open-ended  lines,  and  sampling  connections.  Non-methane  VOC  emissions  are  calculated 
using  emission  factors  (in  lb/hr/component)  and  emission  equations  developed  by  the  EPA  in 
the  Protocol  for  Equipment  Leak  Emission  Estimates. 54  The  number  of  components  at  a 
refinery  are  specific  to  a  refinery.  However,  model  equipment  counts  were  developed  for  the 
petroleum  refinery  NESHAP  for  refineries  with  crude  charge  capacities  less  than 
50,000  barrels/stream  day  (bbl/sd)  and  greater  than  or  equal  to  50,000  bbl/sd.  These  counts 
are  presented  in  Tables  6-8  and  6-9. 142  Benzene  emissions  from  equipment  leaks  may  be 
estimated  by  multiplying  the  equipment  counts,  the  equipment  leak  factor,  and  the  benzene 
Concentration  in  the  process  from  Table  6-6.  It  is  generally  assumed  that  the  speciation  of 
compounds  inside  a  process  line  are  equal  to  the  compounds  leaking. 

The  Western  States  Petroleum  Association  (WSPA)  and  the  American  Petroleum 
Institute  (API)  commissioned  the  development  of  a  1993  refinery  equipment  leak  study145  to 
develop  new  emission  factors  and  correlation  equations.139  The  data  from  the  1993  study  has 
been  combined  with  data  from  a  1993  marketing  terminal  equipment  leak  study.146 

For  information  on  emission  factors  and  equations  for  loading  and  transport 
operations,  refer  to  Section  6.4  (Gasoline  Marketing)  of  this  document.

Refineries  with  crude  charge  capacities  greater  than  50.000  bbl/sd 


Air  emissions  from  petroleum  refinery  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  are 
one  of  the  largest  sources  of  VOC  emissions  at  a  refinery  and  are  dependent  on  variables 
including  wastewater  throughput,  type  of  pollutants,  pollutant  concentrations,  and  the  amount 
of  contact  wastewater  has  with  the  air. 

Table  6-10  presents  model  process  unit  characteristics  for  petroleum  refinery 
wastewater.147  The  table  includes  average  flow  factors,  average  volatile  HAP  concentrations, 
and  average  benzene  concentrations  by  process  unit  type  to  estimate  uncontrolled  emissions 
from  petroleum  refinery  wastewater  streams.  Flow  factors  were  derived  from  Section  114 
questionnaire  responses  compiled  for  the  Refinery  NESHAP  study.  Volatile  HAP  and 
benzene  concentrations  were  derived  from  Section  114  questionnaire  responses,  90-day 
Benzene  Waste  Operations  NESHAP  (BWON)  reports,  and  equilibrium  calculations. 

Uncontrolled  wastewater  emissions  for  petroleum  refinery  process  units  can  be 
estimated  multiplying  the  average  flow  factor,  the  volatile  HAP  concentrations,  and  the 
fraction  emitted  presented  in  Table  6-10,  for  each  specific  refinery  process  unit  capacity. 

Wastewater  emission  factors  for  oil/water  separators,  air  flotation  systems,  and 
sludge  dewatering  units  are  presented  in  Table  6-11. 148151 

Another  option  for  estimating  emissions  of  organic  compounds  from  wastewater 
treatment  systems  is  to  use  the  air  emission  model  presented  in  the  EPA  document  Compilation 
of  Air  Pollutant  Emission  Factors  (AP-42),  in  Section  4.3,  entitled  “Wastewater  Collection, 
Treatment,  and  Storage.”64  This  emission  model  (referred  to  as  SIMS  in  AP-42  and  now 
superceded  by  Water  8)  is  based  on  mass  transfer  correlations  and  can  predict  the  emissions  of 
individual  organic  species  from  a  wastewater  treatment  system.

6.3.3 


Controls  and  Regulatory  Analysis 


This  section  presents  information  on  controls  for  process  vents  at  petroleum 
refineries,  and  identifies  other  sections  in  this  document  that  may  be  consulted  to  obtain 
information  on  control  technology  for  storage  tanks,  and  equipment  leaks.  Applicable  Federal 
regulations  to  process  vents,  storage  tanks,  equipment  leaks,  transfer  operations,  and 
wastewater  emissions  are  briefly  described. 

According  to  the  EPA  ICR  and  Section  114  surveys,  the  most  reported  types  of 
control  for  catalyst  regeneration  process  vents  at  fluid  catalytic  cracking  units  were 
electrostatic  precipitators,  carbon  monoxide  (CO)  boilers,  cyclones,  and  scrubbers.  Some 

refineries  have  reported  controlling  their  emissions  with  scrubbers  at  catalytic  reformer 
regeneration  vents. 

For  miscellaneous  process  vents,  including  miscellaneous  equipment  in  various 
process  units  throughout  the  refinery,  the  most  reported  controls  were  flares,  incinerators, 
and/or  boilers.  Other  controls  for  miscellaneous  process  vents  reported  by  refineries  include 
scrubbers,  electrostatic  precipitators,  fabric  filters,  and  cyclones. 

The  process  vent  provisions  included  in  the  Petroleum  Refinery  NESHAP 
promulgated  on  September  18,  1995  affect  organic  HAP  emissions  from  miscellaneous  process 
vents  throughout  a  refinery.49  These  vents  include  but  are  not  limited  to  vent  streams  from 
caustic  wash  accumulators,  distillation  condensers/accumulators,  flash/knock-out  drums, 
reactor  vessels,  scrubber  overheads,  stripper  overheads,  vacuum  (steam)  ejectors,  wash  tower 
overheads,  water  wash  accumulators,  and  blowdown  condensers/accumulators. 

f 

For  information  about  controls  for  storage  tanks  refer  to  Section  4.5.3  -  Storage 
Tank  Emissions,  Controls,  and  Regulations. 

! 


6-28 


Storage  tanks  containing  petroleum  liquids  and  benzene  are  regulated  by  the 
following  Federal  rules: 


1.  “National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene  Emissions  from  Benzene 
Vessels;”61 


2.  “Standards  of  Performance  for  Volatile  Organic  Liquid  Storage  Vessels 
(Including  Petroleum  Liquid  Storage  Vessels)  for  which  Construction, 
Reconstruction,  or  Modification  Commenced  after  July  23,  1984;  ”62  and 

3.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants:  Petroleum 
Refineries.”49 


The  Petroleum  Refinery  NESHAP  requires  that  liquids  containing  greater  than 


4  weight  percent  HAPs  at  existing  storage  vessels,  and  greater  than  2  weight  percent  HAPs  at 

new  storage  vessels  be  controlled. 


There  are  two  primary  control  techniques  for  reducing  equipment  leak 
emissions:  (1)  modification  or  replacement  of  existing  equipment,  and  (2)  implementation  of  a 
Leak  Detection  and  Repair  (LDAR)  program. 


Equipment  leak  emissions  are  regulated  by  the  New  Source  Performance 
Standards  (NSPS)  for  Equipment  Leaks  of  VOC  in  Petroleum  Refineries  promulgated  in 
May  30,  1984. 152  These  standards  apply  to  VOC  emissions  at  affected  facilities  that 
commenced  construction,  modification,  or  reconstruction  after  January  4,  1983. 


The  standards  regulate  compressors,  valves,  pumps,  pressure  relief  devices, 
sampling  connection  systems,  open-ended  valves  or  lines,  and  flanges  or  other  connectors  in 
VOC  service. 

The  Benzene  Equipment  Leaks  National  Emission  Standard  for  Hazardous  Air 
Pollutants  (NESHAP)56  and  the  Equipment  Leaks  NESHAP57  for  fugitive  emission  sources 
regulate  equipment  leak  emissions  from  pumps,  compressors,  pressure  relief  devices,  sampling 
connecting  systems,  open-ended  valves  or  lines,  valves,  flanges  and  other  connectors,  product 


6-29 


accumulator  vessels,  and  specific  control  devices  or  systems  at  petroleum  refineries.  These 
NESHAPs  were  both  promulgated  in  June  6,  1984. 

Equipment  leak  provisions  included  in  the  Petroleum  Refinery  NESHAP  require 
equipment  leak  emissions  to  be  controlled  using  the  control  requirements  of  the  petroleum 
refinery  equipment  leaks  NSPS  or  the  hazardous  organic  NESHAP. 

Any  process  unit  that  has  no  equipment  in  benzene  service  is  exempt  from  the 
equipment  leak  requirements  of  the  benzene  waste  NESHAP.  “In  benzene  service”  means  that 
a  piece  of  equipment  either  contains  or  contacts  a  fluid  (liquid  or  gas)  that  is  at  least  10  percent 
benzene  by  weight  (as  determined  according  to  respective  provisions).  Any  process  unit  that 
has  no  equipment  in  organic  HAP  service  is  exempt  from  the  equipment  leak  requirements  of 
the  petroleum  refinery  NESHAP.  “In  organic  HAP  service”  means  that  a  piece  of  equipment 
contains  or  contacts  a  fluid  that  is  at  least  5  percent  benzene  by  weight. 

Refer  to  Section  6.4  (Gasoline  Marketing)  of  this  L&E  document  for 
information  on  control  technologies  and  regulations  for  loading  and  transport  operations. 

For  information  about  controls  for  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems, 
refer  to  Section  4.5.4  -  Wastewater  Collection  and  Treatment  System  Emissions,  Controls,  and 
Regulation. 


Petroleum  refinery  wastewater  streams  containing  benzene  are  regulated  by  the 
following  Federal  rules: 

1 .  “National  Emission  Standard  for  Benzene  Waste  Operations;”66 

2.  “New  Source  Performance  Standard  for  Volatile  Organic  Compound 
Emissions  from  Petroleum  Refinery  Wastewater  Systems;”153  and 

3.  “National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants:  Petroleum 
Refineries.”49 


6-30 


The  wastewater  provisions  in  the  Petroleum  Refinery  NESHAP  are  the  same  as 
the  Benzene  Waste  Operations  NESHAP. 


6-4  GASOLINE  MARKETING 


Gasoline  storage  and  distribution  activities  represent  potential  sources  of 
benzene  emissions.  The  benzene  content  of  gasoline  ranges  from  less  than  1  to  almost 
5  percent  by  liquid  volume,  but  typical  liquid  concentrations  are  currently  around  0.9  percent 
by  weight.158  Under  Title  II  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  as  amended  in  1990,  the  benzene  content  of 
reformulated  gasoline  (RFG)  will  be  limited  to  1  percent  volume  maximum  (or  0.95  percent 
volume  period  average)  with  a  1.3  percent  volume  absolute  maximum.  In  California,  the 
“Phase  2  Reformulated  Gasoline,”  which  will  be  required  starting  March  1998,  also  has  a 
1  percent  volume  benzene  limit  (or  0.8  percent  volume  average)  with  an  absolute  maximum  of 
1 .2  percent  volume.20  For  this  reason,  it  is  expected  that  the  overall  average  of  benzene 
content  in  gasoline  will  decrease  over  the  next  few  years.  Total  hydrocarbon  emissions  from 
storage  tanks,  material  transfer,  and  vehicle  fueling  do  include  emissions  of  benzene.  This 
section  describes  sources  of  benzene  emissions  from  gasoline  transportation  and  marketing 
operations.  Because  the  sources  of  these  emissions  are  so  widespread,  individual  locations  are 
not  identified  in  this  section.  Instead,  emission  factors  are  presented,  along  with  a  general 
discussion  of  the  sources  of  these  emissions. 


The  flow  of  the  gasoline  marketing  system  in  the  United  States  is  presented  in 
Figure  6-3.153  The  gasoline  distribution  network  includes  storage  tanks,  tanker  ships  and 
barges,  tank  trucks  and  railcars,  pipelines,  bulk  terminals,  bulk  plants,  and  service  stations. 
From  refmeries,  gasoline  is  delivered  to  bulk  terminals  by  way  of  pipelines,  tanker  ships,  or 
barges.  Bulk  terminals  may  also  receive  petroleum  products  from  other  terminals.  From  bulk 
terminals,  petroleum  products  (including  gasoline)  are  distributed  by  tank  trucks  to  bulk  plants. 
Both  bulk  terminals  and  bulk  plants  deliver  gasoline  to  private,  commercial,  and  retail 
customers.  Daily  product  at  a  terminal  averages  about  250,000  gallons  (950,000  liters),  in 
contrast  to  about  5,000  gallons  (19,000  liters)  for  an  average  size  bulk  plant.154

Service  stations  receive  gasoline  by  tank  truck  from  terminals  or  bulk  plants  or 
directly  from  refineries,  and  usually  store  the  gasoline  in  underground  storage  tanks.  Gasoline 
service  stations  are  establishments  primarily  selling  gasoline  and  automotive  lubricants. 

Gasoline  is  by  far  the  largest  volume  of  petroleum  product  marketed  in  the 
United  States,  with  a  nationwide  consumption  of  115  billion  gallons  (434  billion  liters)  in 
1993. 155  There  are  presently  an  estimated  1,300  bulk  terminals  storing  gasoline  in  the 
United  States.156  About  half  of  these  terminals  receive  products  from  refineries  by  pipeline 
(pipeline  breakout  stations),  and  half  receive  products  by  ship  or  barge  delivery  (bulk  gas-line 
terminals).  Most  of  the  terminals  (66  percent)  are  located  along  the  east  coast  and  in  the 
Midwest.  The  remainder  are  dispersed  throughout  the  country,  with  locations  largely 
determined  by  population  patterns. 

The  benzene  emission  factors  presented  in  the  following  discussions  were 
derived  by  multiplying  AP-42  VOC  emission  factors  for  transportation  and  marketing157  times 
the  fraction  of  benzene  in  the  vapors  emitted.  The  average  weight  fraction  of  benzene  in 
gasoline  vapors  (0.009)  was  taken  from  Reference  157.  When  developing  emission  estimates, 
the  gasoline  vapor  emission  factors  should  be  modified  by  specific  benzene  weight  fraction  in 
the  vapor,  if  available.  Also  a  distinction  should  be  made  between  winter  and  summer  blends 
of  gasoline  (a  difference  in  the  Reid  vapor  pressure  of  the  gasoline,  which  varies  from  an 
average  of  12.8  psi  in  the  winter  to  an  average  of  9.3  in  non- winter  seasons)  to  account  for  the 
different  benzene  fractions  present  in  both.158 

The  transport  of  gasoline  with  marine  vessels,  distribution  at  bulk  plants,  and 
distribution  at  service  stations,  their  associated  benzene  emissions,  and  their  controls  are 
discussed  below.

6.4.1 


Benzene  Emissions  from  Loading  Marine  Vessels 


Benzene  can  be  emitted  while  crude  oil  and  refinery  products  (gasoline, 
distillate  oil,  etc.)  are  loaded  and  transported  by  marine  tankers  and  barges.  Loading  losses 
are  the  primary  source  of  evaporative  emissions  from  marine  vessel  operations.159  These 
emissions  occur  as  vapors  in  “empty”  cargo  tanks  are  expelled  into  the  atmosphere  as  liquid  is 
added  to  the  cargo  tank.  The  vapors  may  be  composed  of  residual  material  left  in  the  “empty” 
cargo  tank  and/or  the  material  being  added  to  the  tank.  Therefore,  the  exact  composition  of 
the  vapors  emitted  during  the  loading  process  may  be  difficult  to  predict. 

Benzene  emissions  from  tanker  ballasting  also  occur  as  a  result  of  vapor 
displacement. .  Ballasting  emissions  occur  as  the  ballast  water  enters  the  cargo  tanks  and 
displace  vapors  remaining  in  the  tank  from  the  previous  cargo.  In  addition  to  loading  and 
ballasting  losses,  transit  losses  occur  while  the  cargo  is  in  transit.157160 

Volatile  organic  compound  (VOC)  emission  factors  for  petroleum  liquids  for 
marine  vessel  loading  are  provided  in  the  EPA  document  Compilation  of  Air  Pollutant 
Emission  Factors  (AP-42),  Chapter  5 157  and  the  EPA  document  VOC /HAP  Emissions  from 
Marine  Vessel  Loading  Operations  -  Technical  Support  Document  for  Proposed  Standards  ,159 

Uncontrolled  VOC  and  benzene  emission  factors  for  loading  gasoline  in  marine 
vessels  are  presented  in  Table  6-12.  This  table  also  presents  emission  factors  for  tanker 
ballasting  losses  and  transit  losses  from  gasoline  marine  vessels. 

Table  6-13  presents  total  organic  compound  emission  factors  for  marine  vessels 
including  loading  operations,  and  transit  for  crude  oil,  distillate  oil,  and  other  fuels.  Emissions 
of  benzene  associated  with  loading  distillate  fuel  and  other  fuels  are  very  low,  due  primarily  to 
their  low  VOC  emission  factor  and  benzene  content.  When  developing  benzene  emission 
estimates,  the  total  organic  compound  emission  factors  presented  in  Table  6-13  should  be 
multiplied  by  specific  benzene  weight  fraction  in  the  fuel  vapor,  if  available.

6.4.2 


Benzene  Emissions  from  Bulk  Gasoline  Plants  and  Bulk  Gasoline  Terminals 


i  Each  operation  in  which  gasoline  is  transferred  or  stored  is  a  potential  source  of 

benzene  emissions.  At  bulk  terminals  and  bulk  plants,  loading,  unloading,  and  storing 
gasoline  are  sources  of  benzene  emissions. 

i 

Emissions  from  Gasoline  Loading  and  Unloading 

The  gasoline  that  is  stored  in  above  ground  tanks  at  bulk  terminals  and  bulk 
plants  is  pumped  through  loading  racks  that  measure  the  amount  of  product.  The  loading  racks 
consist  of  pumps,  meters,  and  piping  to  transfer  the  gasoline  or  other  liquid  petroleum 
products.  Loading  of  gasoline  into  tank  trucks  can  be  accomplished  by  one  of  three  methods: 
splash,  top  submerged,  or  bottom  loading.  Bulk  plants  and  terminals  use  the  same  three 
methods  for  loading  gasoline  into  tank  trucks.  In  splash  loading,  gasoline  is  introduced  into 
the  tank  truck  directly  through  a  hatch  located  on  the  top  of  the  truck.160  Top  submerged 
loading  is  done  by  attaching  a  downspout  to  the  fill  pipe  so  that  gasoline  is  added  to  the  tank 
truck  near  the  bottom  of  the  tank.  Bottom  loading  is  the  loading  of  product  into  the  truck  tank 
from  the  bottom.  Emissions  occur  when  the  product  being  loaded  displaces  vapors  in  the  tank 
being  filled.  Top  submerged  loading  and  bottom  loading  reduce  the  amount  of  material 
(including  benzene)  that  is  emitted  by  generating  fewer  additional  vapors  during  the  loading 
process.160  A  majority  of  facilities  loading  tank  trucks  use  bottom  loading. 

Table  6-14  lists  emission  factors  for  gasoline  vapor  and  benzene  from  gasoline 
loading  racks  at  bulk  terminals  and  bulk  plants.160  The  gasoline  vapor  emission  factors  were 
taken  from  Reference  157.  The  benzene  factors  were  obtained  by  multiplying  the  gasoline 
vapor  factor  by  the  average  benzene  content  of  the  vapor  (0.009  percent).158

Emissions  from  Storage  Tanks 


Storage  emissions  of  benzene  at  bulk  terminals  and  bulk  plants  depend  on  the 
type  of  storage  tank  used.  A  typical  bulk  terminal  may  have  four  or  five  above  ground  storage 
tanks  with  capacities  ranging  from  400,000  to  4  million  gallons  (1,500  to  15,000  m3).160  Most 
tanks  in  gasoline  service  are  of  an  external  floating  roof  design.  Fixed-roof  tanks,  still  used  in 
some  areas  to  store  gasoline,  use  pressure-vacuum  vents  to  operate  at  a  slight  internal  pressure 
or  vacuum  and  control  breathing  losses.  Some  tanks  may  use  vapor  balancing  or  processing 
equipment  to  control  working  losses. 

The  major  types  of  emissions  from  fixed-roof  tanks  are  breathing  and  working 
losses.  Breathing  loss  is  the  expulsion  of  vapor  from  a  tank  vapor  space  that  has  expanded  or 
contracted  because  of  daily  changes  in  temperature  and  barometric  pressure.  The  emissions 
occur  in  the  absence  of  any  liquid  level  change  in  the  tank.  Combined  filling  and  emptying 
losses  are  called  “working  losses.”  Emptying  losses  occur  when  the  air  that  is  drawn  into  the 
tank  during  liquid  removal  saturates  with  hydrocarbon  vapor  and  is  expelled  when  the  tank  is 
filled. 


A  typical  external  floating-roof  tank  consists  of  a  cylindrical  steel  shell  equipped 
with  a  deck  or  roof  that  floats  on  the  surface  of  the  stored  liquid,  rising  and  falling  with  the 
liquid  level.  The  liquid  surface  is  completely  covered  by  the  floating  roof  except  in  the  small 
annular  space  between  the  roof  and  the  shell.  A  seal  attached  to  the  roof  touches  the  tank  wall 
(except  for  small  gaps  in  some  cases)  and  covers  the  remaining  area.  The  seal  slides  against 
the  tank  wall  as  the  roof  is  raised  or  lowered.  The  floating  roof  and  the  seal  system  serve  to 
reduce  the  evaporative  loss  of  the  stored  liquid. 

An  internal  floating-roof  tank  has  both  a  permanently  affixed  roof  and  a  roof 
that  floats  inside  the  tank  on  the  liquid  surface  (contact  roof),  or  is  supported  on  pontoons 
several  inches  above  the  liquid  surface  (noncontact  roof).  The  internal  floating-roof  rises  and 
falls  with  the  liquid  level,  and  helps  to  restrict  the  evaporation  of  organic  liquids. 


6-39 


The  four  classes  of  losses  that  floating  roof  tanks  experience  include  withdrawal 
loss,  rim  seal  loss,  deck  fitting  loss,  and  deck  seam  loss.  Withdrawal  losses  are  caused  by  the 
stored  liquid  clinging  to  the  side  of  the  tank  following  the  lowering  of  the  roof  as  liquid  is 
withdrawn.  Rim  seal  losses  are  caused  by  leaks  at  the  seal  between  the  roof  and  the  sides  of 
the  tank.  Deck  fitting  losses  are  caused  by  leaks  around  support  columns  and  deck  fittings 
within  internal  floating  roof  tanks.  Deck  seam  losses  are  caused  by  leaks  at  the  seams  where 
panels  of  a  bolted  internal  floating  roof  are  joined. 

Table  6-15  shows  emission  factors  during  both  non- winter  and  winter  for 
storage  tanks  at  a  typical  bulk  terminal.158  The  emission  factors  were  derived  from  AP-42 
equations  and  a  weight  fraction  of  benzene  in  the  vapor  of  0.009. 158  Table  6-16  shows 
uncontrolled  emission  factors  for  gasoline  vapor  and  benzene  for  a  typical  bulk  plant.160 
Table  6-17  shows  emission  factors  during  both  non-winter  and  winter  months  for  storage  tanks 
at  pipeline  breakout  stations.158  The  emission  factor  equations  in  AP-42  are  based  on  the  same 
equations  contained  in  the  EPA’s  computer-based  program  “TANKS.”  Since  TANKS  is 
regularly  updated,  the  reader  should  refer  to  the  latest  version  of  the  TANKS  program 
(version  3.1  at  the  time  this  document  was  finalized)  to  calculate  the  latest  emission  factors  for 
fixed-  and  floating-roof  storage  tanks.  The  factors  in  Tables  6-15  and  6-17  were  calculated 
with  equations  from  an  earlier  version  of  TANKS  and  do  not  represent  the  latest  information 
available.  They  are  presented  to  show  the  type  of  emission  factors  that  can  be  developed  from 
the  TANKS  program. 

Emissions  from  Gasoline  Tank  Trucks 

Gasoline  tank  trucks  have  been  demonstrated  to  be  major  sources  of  vapor 
leakage.  Some  vapors  may  leak  uncontrolled  to  the  atmosphere  from  dome  cover  assemblies, 
pressure-vacuum  (P-V)  vents,  and  vapor  collection  piping  and  vents.  Other  sources  of  vapor 
leakage  on  tank  trucks  that  occur  less  frequently  include  tank  shell  flaws,  liquid  and  vapor 
transfer  hoses,  improperly  installed  or  loosened  overfill  protection  sensors,  and  vapor 
couplers.  This  leakage  has  been  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  100  percent  of  the  vapors  w'hich

should  have  been  captured  and  to  average  30  percent.  Because  terminal  controls  are  usually 
found  in  areas  where  trucks  are  required  to  collect  vapors  after  delivery  of  product  to  bulk 
plants  or  service  stations  (balance  service),  the  gasoline  vapor  emission  factor  associated  with 
uncontrolled  truck  leakage  was  assumed  to  be  30  percent  of  the  uncontrolled  balance  service 
truck  loading  factor  (980  mg/liter  x  0.30  =  294  mg/liter).160  Thus  the  emission  factor  for 
benzene  emissions  from  uncontrolled  truck  leakage  is  2.6  mg/liter,  based  on  a  benzene/vapor 
ratio  of  0.009. 

6.4.3  Benzene  Emissions  from  Service  Stations 

The  discussion  on  service  station  operations  is  divided  into  two  areas:  the 
filling  of  the  underground  storage  tank  (Stage  I)  and  automobile  refueling  (Stage  II).  Although 
terminals  and  bulk  plants  also  have  two  distinct  operations  (tank  filling  and  truck  loading),  the 
filling  of  the  underground  tank  at  the  service  station  ends  the  wholesale  gasoline  marketing 
chain.  The  automobile  refueling  operations  interact  directly  with  the  public  so  that  control  of 
these  operations  can  be  performed  by  putting  control  equipment  on  either  the  service  station  or 
the  automobile. 

Stage  I  Emissions  at  Service  Stations 

Normally,  gasoline  is  delivered  to  service  stations  in  large  tank  trucks  from  bulk 
terminals  or  smaller  account  trucks  from  bulk  plants.  Emissions  are  generated  when 
hydrocarbon  vapors  in  the  underground  storage  tank  are  displaced  to  the  atmosphere  by  the 
gasoline  being  loaded  into  the  tank.  As  with  other  loading  losses,  the  quantity  of  the  service 
station  tank  loading  loss  depends  on  several  variables,  including  the  quantity  of  liquid 
transferred,  size  and  length  of  the  fill  pipe,  the  method  of  filling,  the  tank  configuration  and 
gasoline  temperature,  vapor  pressure,  and  composition.  A  second  source  of  emissions  from 
service  station  tankage  is  underground  tank  breathing.  Breathing  losses  tend  to  be  minimal  for 
underground  storage  tanks  due  to  nearly  constant  ground  temperatures  and  are  primarily  the 
result  of  barometric  pressure  changes. 


6-46 


Stage  II  Emissions  of  Service  Stations 


In  addition  to  service  station  tank  loading  losses,  vehicle  refueling  operations 
are  considered  to  be  a  major  source  of  emissions.  Vehicle  refueling  emissions  are  attributable 
to  vapor  displaced  from  the  automobile  tank  by  dispensed  gasoline  and  to  spillage.  The  major 
factors  affecting  the  quantity  of  emissions  are  dispensed  fuel  temperature,  differential 
temperature  between  the  vehicle's  tank  temperature  and  the  dispensed  fuel  temperature,  and 
fuel  Reid  vapor  pressure  (RVP). 161,162  Several  other  factors  that  may  have  an  effect  upon 
refueling  emissions  are:  fill  rate,  amount  of  residual  fuel  in  the  tank,  total  amount  of  fill, 
position  of  nozzle  in  the  fill-neck,  and  ambient  temperature.  However,  the  magnitude  of  these 
effects  is  much  less  than  that  for  any  of  the  major  factors  mentioned  above.161 

Spillage  loss  is  made  up  of  configurations  from  prefill  and  postfill  nozzle  drip 
and  from  spit-back  and  overflow  from  the  vehicle's  fuel  tank  filler  pipe  during  filling. 

Table  6-18  lists  the  uncontrolled  emission  factors  for  a  typical  gasoline  service  station.160,163 
This  table  incudes  an  emission  factor  for  displacement  losses  from  vehicle  refueling. 

However,  the  following  approach  is  more  accurate  to  estimate  vehicle  refueling  emissions. 

Emissions  can  be  calculated  using  MOBILE  5a,  EPA’s  mobile  source  emission 
factor  computer  model.  MOBILE  5a  uses  the  following  equation:163 

Er  =  264.2  [(-5.909)  -  0.0949  (aT)  +  0.0884  (TD)  4-  0.485  (RVP)] 

where: 

Er  =  Emission  rate,  mg  VOC/0  of  liquid  loaded 

RVP  =  Reid  vapor  pressure,  psia  (see  Table  6- 19) 163 

aT  =  Difference  between  the  temperature  of  the  fuel  in  the  automobile 

tank  and  the  temperature  of  the  dispensed  fuel,  °F  (see 
Table  6-20)161 

Td  =  Dispensed  fuel  temperature,  °F  (see  Table  6-21)164 

Using  this  emission  factor  equation,  vehicle  refueling  emission  factors  can  be  derived  for 
specific  geographic  locations  and  for  different  seasons  of  the  year.

In  the  absence  of  specific  data,  Tables  6-19,  6-20,  and  6-21  may  be  used  to 
estimate  refueling  emissions.  Tables  6-19,  6-20,  and  6-21  list  gasoline  RVPs,  aT,  and  TD 
values  respectively  for  the  United  States  as  divided  into  six  regions: 


Region  1:  Connecticut,  Delaware,  Elinois,  Indiana,  Kentucky,  Maine, 

Maryland,  Massachusetts,  Michigan,  New  Hampshire, 

New  Jersey,  New  York,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island, 
Virginia,  West  Virginia,  and  Wisconsin. 

Region  2:  Alabama.  Arkansas,  Florida,  Georgia,  Louisiana,  Mississippi, 

North  Carolina,  South  Carolina,  and  Tennessee.

6.4.4 


Control  Technology  for  Marine  Vessel  Loading 


Marine  vapor  control  systems  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  vapor 
recover)'  systems  and  vapor  destruction  systems.  There  are  a  wide  variety  of  vapor  recovery 
systems  that  can  be  used  with  vapor  collection  systems.  Most  of  the  vapor  recovery  systems 
installed  to  date  include  refrigeration,  carbon  adsorption/absorption,  or  lean  oil  absorption. 
Three  major  types  of  vapor  destruction  or  combustion  systems  that  can  operate  over  the  wide 
flow  rate  and  heat  content  ranges  of  marine  applications  are:  open  flame  flares,  enclosed  flame 
flares,  and  thermal  incinerators.165 


When  selecting  a  vapor  control  system  for  a  terminal,  the  decision  on 
recovering  the  commodity  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  VOC  stream  (expected  variability  in 
flow  rate  and  hydrocarbon  content),  and  locational  factors,  such  as  availability  of  utilities  and 
distance  from  the  tankship  or  barge  to  the  vapor  control  system.  The  primary  reason  for 
selecting  incineration  is  that  many  marine  terminals  load  more  than  one  commodity.159164

6.4.5  Control  Technology  for  Gasoline  Transfer 

At  many  bulk  terminals  and  bulk  plants,  benzene  emissions  from  gasoline 
transfer  are  controlled  by  CTG,  NSPS,  and  new  MACT  programs.  Control  technologies 
include  the  use  of  a  vapor  processing  system  in  conjunction  with  a  vapor  collection  system.160 
Vapor  balancing  systems,  consisting  of  a  pipeline  between  the  vapor  spaces  of  the  truck  and 
the  storage  tanks,  are  closed  systems.  These  systems  allow  the  transfer  of  displaced  vapor  into 
the  transfer  truck  as  gasoline  is  put  into  the  storage  tank.160 

Also,  these  systems  collect  and  recover  gasoline  vapors  from  empty,  returning 
tank  trucks  as  they  are  filled  with  gasoline  from  storage  tanks.  The  control  efficiency  of  the 
balance  system  ranges  from  93  to  100  percent.1'  Figure  6-4  shows  a  Stage  I  control  vapor 
balance  system  at  a  bulk  plant.160 

At  service  stations,  vapor  balance  systems  contain  the  gasoline  vapors  within  the 
station's  underground  storage  tanks  for  transfer  to  empty  gasoline  tank  trucks  returning  to  the 
bulk  terminal  or  bulk  plant.  Figure  6-5  shows  a  diagram  of  a  service  station  vapor  balance 
system.160  For  more  information  on  Stage  II  controls  refer  to  Section  6.4.7. 

6.4.6  Control  Technology  for  Gasoline  Storage 

The  control  technologies  for  benzene  emissions  from  gasoline  storage  involve 
upgrading  the  type  of  storage  tank  used  or  adding  a  vapor  control  system.  For  fixed-roof 
tanks,  emissions  are  most  readily  controlled  by  installation  of  internal  floating  roofs.  An 
internal  floating  roof  reduces  the  area  of  exposed  liquid  surface  on  the  tank  and,  therefore.

decreases  evaporative  loss.  Installing  an  internal  floating  roof  in  a  fixed-roof  tank  can  reduce 
total  emissions  by  68.5  to  97.8  percent.160 

For  external  floating-roof  tanks,  no  control  measures  have  been  identified  for 
controlling  withdrawal  losses  and  emissions.160  These  emissions  are  functions  of  the  turnover 
rate  of  the  tank  and  the  characteristics  of  the  tank  shell.  Rim  seal  losses  in  external  floating 
roof  tanks  depend  on  the  type  of  seal.  Liquid-mounted  seals  are  more  effective  than 
vapor-mounted  seals  in  reducing  rim  seal  losses.  Metallic  shoe  seals  are  more  effective  than 
vapor-mounted  seals  but  less  effective  than  liquid-mounted  seals. 160 

For  additional  information  on  control  technology  for  storage  tanks  refer  to  the 

EPA  documents  Compilation  of  Air  Pollutant  Emission  Factors  (AP-42),  Chapter  733  and 
Reference  158. 

6.4.7  Control  Technology  for  Vehicle  Refueling  Emissions 

Vehicle  refueling  emissions  are  attributable  to  vapor  displaced  from  the 
automobile  tank  by  dispensed  gasoline  and  to  spillage. 

The  two  basic  refueling  vapor  control  alternatives  are:  control  systems  on 
service  station  equipment  (Stage  II  controls),  and  control  systems  on  vehicles  (onboard 
controls).  Onboard  controls  are  basically  limited  to  the  carbon  canister. 

There  are  currently  three  types  of  Stage  II  systems  in  limited  use  in  the  United 
States:  the  vapor  balance,  the  hybrid,  and  the  vacuum  assist  systems.  In  the  vapor  balance 
system,  gasoline  vapor  in  the  automobile  fuel  tank  is  displaced  by  the  incoming  liquid  gasoline 
and  is  prevented  from  escaping  to  the  atmosphere  at  the  fillneck/nozzle  interface  by  a  flexible 
rubber  “boot.”  This  boot  is  fitted  over  the  standard  nozzle  and  is  attached  to  a  hose  similar  to 
the  liquid  hose.  The  hose  is  connected  to  piping  which  vents  to  the  underground  tank.  An 
exchange  is  made  (vapor  for  liquid)  as  the  liquid  displaces  vapor  to  the  underground  storage 


6-56 


tank.  The  underground  storage  tank  assists  this  transaction  by  drawing  in  a  volume  of  vapor 
equal  to  the  volume  of  liquid  removed.160 

t  The  vacuum  assist  system  differs  from  the  balance  system  in  that  a  “blower”  (a 

vacuum  pump)  is  used  to  provide  an  extra  pull  at  the  nozzle/fillneck  interface.  Assist  systems 
can  recover  vapors  effectively  without  a  tight  seal  at  the  nozzle/fillpipe  interface  because  only  a 
close  fit  is  necessary.  A  slight  vacuum  is  maintained  at  the  nozzle/fillneck  interface  allowing 
air  to  be  drawn  into  the  system  and  not  allowing  the  vapors  to  escape.  Because  of  this  assist, 
the  interface  “boot”  need  not  be  as  tight  fitting  as  with  balance  systems.  Further,  the  vast 
majority  of  assist  nozzles  do  not  require  interlock  mechanisms.  Assist  systems  generally  have 
vapor  passage  valves  located  in  the  vapor  passage  somewhere  other  than  in  the  nozzles, 
resulting  in  a  nozzle  which  is  less  bulky  and  cumbersome  than  nozzles  employed  by  vapor 
balance  systems.160 

There  are  four  assist  systems  that  are  currently  available  and  certified  by  the 
California  Air  Resources  Board  (CARB):  the  Hasstech,  the  Healy,  the  Hirt,  and  the  Amoco 
Bellowless  Nozzle  System.163 

The  hybrid  system  borrows  from  the  concepts  of  both  the  balance  and  vacuum 
assist  systems.  It  is  designed  to  enhance  vapor  recovery  at  the  nozzle/fillneck  interface  by 
vacuum,  while  keeping  the  vacuum  low  enough  so  that  a  minimum  level  of  excess  vapor/ air  is 
returned  to  the  underground  storage  tank. 

With  the  hybrid  system,  a  small  amount  of  the  liquid  gasoline  (less  than 
10  percent)  pumped  from  the  storage  tank  is  routed  (before  metering)  to  a  restricting  nozzle 
called  an  aspirator.  As  the  gasoline  goes  through  this  restricting  nozzle,  a  small  vacuum  is 
generated.  This  vacuum  is  used  to  draw  vapors  into  the  rubber  boot  at  the  interface.  Because 
the  vacuum  is  so  small,  very  little  excess  air,  if  any,  is  drawn  into  the  boot,  hose  and 
underground  storage  tank,  and  thus  there  is  no  need  for  a  secondary  processor,  such  as  the 
vacuum  assist  s  incinerator. 


6-57 


Results  of  the  California  Air  Resources  Board  certification  testing  program  on 
Stage  II  vapor  recovery  systems  indicate  that  all  of  the  Stage  II  vapor  recovery  systems 
discussed  above  are  capable  of  achieving  an  emission  reduction  of  95  percent. 160  However, 
efficiencies  vary  depending  upon  inspection  frequency,  maintenance,  and  number  of  stations 
exempted.  Reference  163  discusses  efficiency  in  more  detail. 

Onboard  vapor  control  systems  consist  of  carbon  canisters  installed  on  the 
vehicle  to  control  refueling  emissions.  The  carbon  canister  system  adsorbs,  on  activated 
carbon,  the  vapors  which  are  displaced  from  the  vehicle  fuel  tank  by  the  incoming  gasoline. 
Such  a  system  first  absorbs  the  emissions  released  during  refueling  and  subsequently  purges 
these  vapors  from  the  carbon  to  the  engine  carburetor  when  it  is  operating.  This  system  is 
essentially  an  expansion  of  the  present  evaporative  emissions  control  system  used  in  all  new 
cars  to  minimize  breathing  losses  from  the  fuel  tank  and  to  control  carburetor  evaporative 
emissions.  However,  unlike  the  present  system,  a  refueling  vapor  recovery  system  will  require 
a  tight  seal  at  the  nozzle/fillneck  interface  during  refueling  operations  to  ensure  vapors  flow 
into  the  carbon  canister  and  are  not  lost  to  the  atmosphere.  An  efficiency  of  98  percent  has 
been  reported  for  control  of  automobile  refueling  losses  using  onboard  control  systems.160 

For  additional  information  on  control  of  vehicle  refueling  emissions  at  gasoline 
dispensing  facilities  refer  to  Reference  163. 

6.4.8  Regulatory  Analysis 

Gasoline  loading  emissions  at  bulk  gasoline  terminals  are  regulated  by  the  New 
Source  Performance  Standards  promulgated  on  August  18,  1983. 166  These  standards  apply  to 
VOC  emissions  at  affected  facilities  that  commenced  construction  or  modification  after 
December  17,  1980.  The  standards  regulate  bulk  gasoline  terminals  with  a  throughput  greater 
than  75,700  liters  per  day. 


6-58 


Also,  the  NESHAP  for  gasoline  distribution  that  was  promulgated  on 
December  14,  1994,  regulates  organic  hazardous  air  pollutant  (HAP)  emissions  (including 
benzene)  from  gasoline  loading  and  transport  operations.  The  NESHAP  covers  HAP 
emissions  from  storage  vessels,  piping  and  handling,  and  loading  at  bulk  gasoline  terminals, 
and  storage  vessels  at  piping  systems  that  handle  the  gasoline  at  pipeline  breakout  stations.167 

6.5  PUBLICLY  OWNED  TREATMENT  WORKS 

Publicly  owned  treatment  works  (POTWs)  treat  wastewater  from  residential, 
institutional,  commercial,  and  industrial  facilities.  In  general,  benzene  emissions  from  POTWs 
originate  from  the  benzene  content  of  industrial  wastewater  that  is  introduced  into  POTWs,  and 
benzene  may  be  emitted  by  volatilization  at  the  liquid  surface  of  the  wastewater. 

Industrial  wastewater  sent  to  POTWs  from  industrial  facilities  may  be  pre¬ 
treated  or  untreated,  depending  on  State  and  Federal  industrial  wastewater  quality  standards. 
The  following  discussion  describes  the  various  treatment  process  units  at  POTWs  from  which 
benzene  may  be  emitted. 

6.5.1  Process  Description  of  POTWs 

A  POTW  treats  wastewater  using  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  treatment 
processes.  Most  POTWs  are  required  by  Federal  and  State  laws  to  treat  wastewater  using 
“primary”  treatment  methods  to  remove  coarse  and  suspended  solids  and  “secondary” 
treatment  methods  to  remove  biodegradable  organics,  pathogens,  and  additional  solids. 
Additionally,  some  POTWs  are  required  to  use  “tertiary”  treatment  methods  to  remove 
refractory  organics,  nutrients  (e.g.,  phosphorus  and  nitrogen),  dissolved  inorganic  salts,  and 
heavy  metals,  among  other  contaminants.  As  the  wastewater  is  treated,  all  of  the  collected 
solids  and  sludge  undergo  additional  processing  at  the  POTW  to  reduce  sludge  volume, 
organic  content,  and  bacterial  activity  prior  to  disposal. 


6-59 


The  following  discussion  describes  the  various  process  units  included  in  a 
typical  POTW  facility  (shown  in  Figure  6-6),  that  uses  primary  and  secondary  wastewater 
treatment  methods.168  As  discussed  in  Section  6.6.2,  a  testing  program  for  organic  emissions 
from  POTWs  documented  that  benzene  is  emitted  from  most  of  these  process  units. 

Comminutors 

Comminutors  (or  shredders)  are  devices  that  are  used  to  grind  or  cut  waste 
solids  to  about  one-quarter-inch  (6  mm)  particles.  In  one  common  type  of  comminutor,  the 
untreated  wastewater  enters  a  slotted  cylinder  within  which  another  similar  cylinder  with 
sharp-edged  slots  rotates  rapidly.  As  the  solids  are  reduced  in  size,  they  pass  through  the  slots 
of  the  cylinders  and  move  on  with  the  liquid  to  the  treatment  plant.  Comminution  eliminates 
the  need  to  use  screens,  which  collect  large  solid  waste  material  that  must  be  disposed  of 
separately  from  the  sludge.169 

Aerated  Grit  Chambers 

Grit  chambers  are  used  at  many  POTWs  to  remove  dense  solids  (both  inorganic 
and  organic)  present  in  wastewater  (e.g.,  sand,  gravel,  glass,  coffee  grounds).  Aerated  grit 
chambers  work  by  imparting  a  helical  flow  pattern  to  the  sewage  by  aerating  one  side  of  the 
chamber.  The  aeration  allows  the  dense  grit  to  settle  while  keeping  less  dense  organic  material 
in  suspension.  Benzene  emissions  arise  from  aeration  of  the  wastewater  in  the  grit  chamber.168 

Primary  Sedimentation  Tanks 

The  main  function  of  primary  sedimentation  tanks  is  to  remove  suspended 
material  that  settles  readily  from  raw  sewage.  This  material  includes  slower-settling  organic 
matter  as  well  as  fast-settling  grit  if  the  POTW  does  not  have  grit  removal  upstream. 
Additionally,  the  system  removes  floatable  solids,  which  are  composed  mostly  of  fats  and 
grease.  The  wastewater  enters  the  tank  at  one  end,  flows  through  the  tank  and  under  a  surface

baffle  located  near  the  tank's  downstream  edge,  over  a  weir,  and  into  an  effluent  channel. 
Sludge  collects  on  the  bottom  of  the  tank.  A  system  of  scrapers  collects  the  sludge  from  the 
bottom  of  the  tank  and  pumps  it  to  gravity  sludge  thickeners  for  further  treatment.  The  surface 
baffle  skims  the  surface  of  the  water  and  collects  the  floatables  for  removal  and  treatment  in 

anaerobic  digesters. 

Small  amounts  of  benzene  are  released  by  volatilization  from  the  quiescent 
section  of  the  tank  prior  to  the  weir.  Most  of  the  benzene  emissions  from  the  primary 
sedimentation  tank  result  from  the  turbulence  that  the  water  undergoes  dropping  over  the  weir 
into  the  outlet  conveyance  channel.  The  height  of  the  water  drop  from  the  weir  is  a  measure  of 
the  energy  dissipated  and  may  relate  to  the  release  of  benzene  emissions.168 

Aerobic  Biological  Treatments 

Aerobic  biological  treatment  involves  the  use  of  microorganisms  to  metabolize 
dissolved  and  colloidal  organic  matter  in  the  wastewater  in  an  aerobic  environment.  Two  types 
of  processes  are  used:  suspended-growth  and  attached-growth.  The  most  common 
suspended-growth  process  used  in  POTWs  is  the  activated  sludge  process;  the  most  common 
attached-growth  process  is  the  trickling  filter.  These  two  types  of  processes  are  described 
below.169 


Activated  Sludge  Process--In  the  activated  sludge  process,  a  high  concentration 
of  microorganisms  that  have  settled  in  the  secondary  clarifiers  (called  activated  sludge)  is 
added  to  settled  wastewater  that  enters  an  aerobic  tank.  The  mixture  enters  an  aeration  tank, 
where  the  organisms  and  wastewater  undergo  further  mixing  with  a  large  quantity  of  air  or 
oxygen  to  maintain  an  aerobic  environment.  There  are  three  common  types  of  aeration  tanks: 
diffused  air,  mechanically  mixed  air,  and  pure  oxygen  (which  can  be  diffused  or  mechanically 
mixed).  Diffused  air  systems  aerate  the  water  by  bubbling  air  from  the  atmosphere  through  the 
water  from  the  bottom  of  the  tank.  Mechanically  mixed  air  systems  use  mechanical  surface 
mixers  that  float  on  the  water  surface. 


6-62 


In  pure  oxygen  systems  (which  are  more  likely  to  be  covered  systems),  pure 
oxygen  is  fed  to  either  submerged  diffusers  or  to  the  head  space  over  a  tank  employing 
mechanical  aerators.  In  diffused  air  or  oxygen  systems,  the  air  or  oxygen  bubbles  can  strip 
VOC  from  the  liquid  phase  depending  on  the  concentrations  and  partial  pressures  of  the 
specific  substances.  In  mechanically  mixed  systems,  the  area  where  the  wastewater/activated 
sludge  mixture  is  agitated  is  a  potential  source  of  VOC  (benzene)  emissions.168,169 

Trickling  Filter-The  trickling  filter  is  an  aerobic  attached-growth  treatment 
process  that  uses  microorganisms  growing  on  a  solid  media  to  metabolize  organic  compounds 
in  the  wastewater.  Trickling  filter  media  beds  are  typically  40  to  100  ft  in  diameter  and  15  to 
40  ft  deep.  Influent  wastewater  from  the  primary  sedimentation  tank  is  sprayed  on  top  of  the 
media  bed.  The  wastewater  is  biologically  treated  as  it  trickles  downward  through  the  media. 
Effluent  from  the  process  is  collected  by  the  underdrain  system  and  sent  to  a  secondary 
clarifier.  Ambient  air  is  blown  upward  through  the  media  to  provide  oxygen  to  sustain 
microbial  growth.  The  exhaust  air  from  the  process  may  contain  benzene  that  was  stripped 
from  the  wastewater  during  treatment.168 

Secondary  Clarification 

Secondary  clarification  is  a  gravity  sedimentation  process  used  in  wastewater 
treatment  to  separate  out  the  activated  sludge  solids  from  the  effluent  from  the  upstream 
biotreatment  process.  Effluent  from  the  biological  treatment  process  is  introduced  into  the 
clarifier  through  submerged  diffusers.  As  the  wastewater  flows  through  the  clarifier  tank  from 
inlet  to  outlet  weirs,  the  solids  settle  to  the  bottom  of  the  tank  while  the  floatables  and  scum  are 
skimmed  off  the  top.  The  tank  bottom  is  sloped  slightly  to  the  discharge  end  of  the  tank  to  two 
hoppers,  where  sludge  is  collected  by  a  chain  and  flight  conveyor  system  and  returned  to  the 
biological  treatment  system  or  to  the  waste  sludge  handling  system.  The  quiescent  section  of 
the  tank  may  release  benzene  by  volatilization  from  the  water  surface.  However,  most  of  the 
benzene  emissions  from  the  secondary  clarifier  result  from  the  turbulence  that  the  water 
undergoes  dropping  over  the  weir  into  the  outlet  conveyance  channel.  In  some  cases,  the  weir 


6-63 


is  notched,  such  that  the  water  flows  through  the  notches,  falling  only  a  few  inches  onto  a 
support  structure.  In  this  latter  case,  there  is  much  less  turbulence  in  the  water,  and  it  is 
expected  that  there  would  be  fewer  emissions  of  VOC  than  in  the  case  where  the  water 
free-falls  directly  into  the  collection  channel.165 

Tertiary  Filters 

Tertiary  filters  remove  unsettled  particles  from  the  wastewater  by  using  enclosed 
(pressure)  filters  or  open  (gravity)  filters.  The  filtering  medium  typically  consists  of  sand  and 
anthracite  coal,  and  may  consist  of  one  or  two  grain  sizes.  To  collect  activated  sludge  effluent, 
the  filters  typically  remove  particles  in  the  size  ranges  of  3  to  5  yum  and  80  to  90  fj.m.  Alum  or 
polymer  is  often  added  prior  to  filtration  to  form  a  floe  and  thus  increase  paniculate  removal. 

Cleaning  of  ternary  filters  (called  backwashing)  typically  occurs  by  forcing 
water  back  through  the  filter.  The  backwash  water  is  typically  recirculated  upstream  in  the 
plant.  Except  for  the  brief  periods  during  backwash,  gravity  teniary  filters  have  quiescent 
surfaces,  and  little  VOC  release  would  be  expected.  Pressure  filters  are  totally  enclosed,  and 
no  air  emissions  occur  during  filtration  from  these  units.168 

Chlorine  Contact  Tanks 

For  the  purposes  of  disinfection,  chlorine  in  the  form  of  chlorine  gas  or  calcium 
or  sodium  hypochlorite  is  fed  into  the  wastewater  just  prior  to  the  chlorine  contact  tank.  The 
chlorine  contact  tank  is  designed  to  allow  the  mixture  of  chlorine  and  wastewater  to  remain  in 
contact  long  enough  to  adequately  kill  the  target  organisms  (15  minutes  to  2  hours).  The 
typical  flow  pattern  is  a  serpentine  pattern,  consisting  of  interior  baffle  walls  within  a 
rectangular  tank.  Although  water  surfaces  are  generally  quiescent,  most  chlorine  contact  tanks 
have  weirs  at  the  end  of  the  tank  to  control  water  levels  in  the  tank.  Depending  on  the  depth  of 
fall  and  flow  rate,  the  turbulence  at  the  weir  overflow  may  result  in  benzene  emissions.168 


6-64 


Dechlorination  Chambers 


Typically,  a  dechlorination  chamber  is  located  adjacent  to  the  chlorine  contact 
tank  to  remove  chlorine  residual  in  the  disinfected  wastewater.  Chlorinated  effluent  from  the 
chlorine  contact  tank  flows  into  the  dechlorination  chamber  through  a  gate  valve.  In  the 
dechlorination  chamber,  an  S02  solution  or  sodium  bisulfate  is  introduced  into  the  wastewater 
through  submerged  diffusers.  The  wastewater  is  hydraulically  mixed  as  the  S02  is  added.  The 
dechlorinated  water  is  discharged  from  the  facility. 168 

Sludge  Thickeners 

Sludge  thickeners  collect  primary  sludge  (from  the  primary  sedimentation  tank) 
and  waste-activated  sludge  (from  the  secondary  clarifier)  to  reduce  the  volume  of  the  sludge 

| 

prior  to  treatment  in  an  anaerobic  digester.  The  two  most  common  types  of  thickening 
processes  are  gravity  sludge  thickeners  and  dissolved  air  floatation  thickeners.  These  two 
types  of  thickeners  are  described  below.168  Additionally,  centrifuges  are  used  to  thicken  sludge 
both  prior  to  and  after  aerobic  digestion.  (Centrifuges  are  discussed  below  under  dewatering 
techniques.) 


Gravity  Sludge  Thickener-In  this  process,  sludge  is  thickened  by  allowing 
heavier  sludge  panicles  to  settle.  Sludge  is  pumped  into  the  center  of  a  circular  tank  from 
below.  Heavier  solid  panicles  sink  to  the  bottom  of  the  tank,  are  removed  as  thickened 
sludge,  and  are  sent  to  digesters.  Lighter  sludge  panicles  (e.g.,  greases)  float  to  the  surface  of 
the  tank  and  are  removed  into  a  scum  trough,  where  they  are  directed  to  a  scum  conditioner. 

As  sludge  is  added  to  the  tank,  the  sludge  flows  outward  radially,  and  liquid  effluent  from  the 
process  flows  outward  over  weirs  and  into  the  effluent  trough  located  on  the  periphery  of  the 
tank.  Typically,  this  liquid  returns  to  the  aeration  tanks  in  the  activated  sludge  process  for 
further  treatment.168 


6-65 


Dissolved  Air  Flotation  Thickener-This  process  is  used  to  float  sludge  by 
forcing  the  sludge  to  rise  to  the  water  surface.  Sludge  is  pumped  into  a  circular  tank  with 
central  feed  or  into  a  rectangular  tank  with  end  feed.  As  the  sludge  enters  the  tank, 
microbubbles  are  introduced  into  the  sludge  by  pressurizing  in  a  retention  tank  a  portion  of  the 
effluent  liquid  from  the  tank.  Pressurization  of  the  liquid  causes  the  air  to  be  dissolved  in  the 
liquid  phase.  After  pressurization,  the  recirculated  effluent  is  mixed  with  the  sludge  feed. 
When  the  pressurized  liquid  is  released  to  atmospheric  pressure,  the  dissolved  air  is  released 
into  the  solution  in  the  form  of  microbubbles.  As  the  sludge  and  pressurized  liquid  mix,  the 
sludge  and  air  mixture  rises  to  the  surface  in  the  form  of  a  sludge  blanket.  Sludge  thickening 
occurs  as  a  result  of  the  sludge  blanket  and  by  drainage  of  entrained  water  from  the  sludge 
blanket.  Surface  skimmers  are  used  to  remove  the  sludge  blanket  from  the  water  surface  for 
further  treatment  in  an  anaerobic  digester. 

Anaerobic  Digestion 

Anaerobic  digestion  is  a  biological  process  conducted  in  the  absence  of  ffee 
oxygen  in  which  anaerobic  and  facultative  bacteria  metabolize  organic  solids  in  sludge, 
releasing  methane  and  C02  as  a  by-product.  Anaerobic  digesters  are  most  commonly 
cylindrical,  with  a  diameter  of  20  to  125  ft  and  a  depth  of  20  to  40  ft.  In  most  digesters,  to 
promote  adequate  contact  between  the  anaerobic  biota  and  organic  matter,  the  sludge  is  mixed 
by  either  internal  gas  recirculation  or  by  digested  sludge  recirculation.  Additionally,  the 
sludge  is  kept  heated  to  about  95 °F  (35 °C)  by  either  direct  steam  injection  into  the  sludge  or 
by  recirculating  sludge  through  an  external  heat  exchanging  device.  With  mixing  and  heating, 
sludge  undergoes  digestion  for  about  15  to  25  days.168,169 

Most  digesters  are  closed  containers  under  a  slight  pressure.  Under  normal 
operation,  there  should  be  no  direct  emissions  of  benzene  to  the  atmosphere.  The  digester  gas 
produced  is  typically  collected  and  routed  to  internal  combustion  engines  to  produce  steam  or 
generate  electricity.  (Refer  to  Section  7.5  for  information  about  benzene  emissions  from  an 


6-66 


internal  combustion  engine  fueled  with  POTW  digester  gas.)  If  the  digester  is  not  covered  or 
the  digester  gases  are  not  collected,  then  benzene  may  be  emitted  directly  from  the  digester.168 

Dewatering  Techniques 

Sludge  dewatering  operations  involve  removal  of  water  from  sludges  by  gravity, 
compression,  and  evaporation  processes.  Common  methods  of  dewatering  are  using  a  belt 

filter  press,  a  sludge  centrifuge,  and  sludge  drying  beds. 

Belt  Filter  Press-Digested  sludge  is  mixed  with  flocculating  cationic  polymers 
which  aid  in  the  separation  of  the  solids  from  the  water.  The  flocculated  sludge  is  initially 
spread  out  horizontally  over  a  moving  filter  belt  that  passes  under  plows  that  turn  the 
sludge/polymer  solution,  aiding  in  the  dewatering  process.  After  gravity  thickening  on  the 
belt,  the  partially  dewatered  sludge  is  conveyed  to  and  falls  into  a  vertical  compression  zone, 
where  water  is  squeezed  out  of  the  sludge  between  two  filter  belts  moving  concurrently 
through  a  series  of  rollers.  The  filtrate  from  dewatering  is  collected  and  returned  to  the  head 
of  the  treatment  plant  for  processing.  Sludge  particles  enmeshed  in  the  polyester  belt  fabric  are 
continuously  washed  off  by  a  highly  pressurized  spray.  The  dried  sludge  (“cake”)  product  is 
collected  and  carried  to  silos  for  storage. 

Benzene  emissions  from  the  belt  filter  press  process  may  be  released  from  the 
following  locations:  (1)  the  gravity  section,  where  liquid  sludge  is  discharged  and  tilled  by 
plows,  (2)  the  filtrate  pans,  where  filtrate  cascades  down  from  the  belts  to  the  filtrate  collection 
channel  below,  (3)  the  compression  zone,  where  the  sludge  is  squeezed  between  the  two  belts, 
and  (4)  the  drainage  sump  into  which  the  filtrate  and  wash  water  are  discharged.168 

Sludge  Centrifuge-Digested  or  pre-digested  sludge  mixed  with  flocculating 
cationic  polymers  is  introduced  into  a  spinning  cylinder  with  a  conical  end  bowl  that  rotates  at 
sufficient  velocity  to  force  the  solids  to  the  sides  of  the  drum.  Inside  the  bowl,  a  concentric 
screw  conveyor  with  helical  flights  turns  at  a  slightly  different  speed  than  the  rotating  drum. 


6-67 


forcing  the  dewatered  solids  to  a  discharge  at  one  end  of  the  centrifuge,  while  the  liquid  flows 
over  to  a  weir  into  a  discharge  at  the  other  end.  The  dewatered  sludge  is  collected  and 
stored.168  Benzene  emissions  may  be  emitted  from  the  point  where  the  separated  liquid  flows 
over  the  weir  and  is  discharged  from  the  centrifuge. 

Sludge  Drying  Bed-A  certain  volume  of  sludge  is  piped  into  shallow  beds, 
where  the  sludge  is  allowed  to  dry  by  gravity  settling,  evaporation,  and  percolation.  Some 
drying  beds  are  equipped  with  a  system  for  decanting  the  liquid  from  the  drying  bed  or 
draining  the  liquid  through  a  sand  bed  to  a  collection  pipe.  Due  to  factors  such  as  rainfall, 
ambient  temperature,  wind  speed,  relative  humidity,  amount  of  sun,  and  the  character  of  the 
sludge,  the  drying  time  varies  from  30  to  60  days.168  These  same  factors  will  likely  affect  the 
level  of  benzene  emissions  from  the  sludge  drying  beds. 

6.5.2  Benzene  Emissions  From  POTWs 

Under  a  program  called  the  Pooled  Emission  Estimation  Program  (PEEP),  21 
POTW  facilities  in  California  were  tested  for  emissions  of  benzene  (among  other  VOC)  from 
18  types  of  process  units  commonly  included  in  POTW  wastewater  treatment  processes.  With 
the  exception  of  one  type  of  process  unit  (comminutor  controlled  with  wet  scrubber),  the 
emissions  test  data  yielded  uncontrolled  benzene  emission  factors.  On  average,  three  facilities 
were  tested  for  each  type  of  process  unit.  The  types  of  process  units  that  were  tested  are 
discussed  above  in  section  6.6.1,  and  include  aerated  processes  (aerated  grit  chambers,  three 
types  of  activated  sludge  units,  trickling  filters,  and  dissolved  air  floatation  thickeners),  gas 
handling  processes  (anaerobic  digesters  and  digester  gas  combustion  devices),  quiescent  basins 
(primary  sedimentation  tanks,  secondary  clarifiers,  tertiary  filters,  chlorine  contact  tanks, 
dechlorination,  and  gravity  thickeners),  sludge  facilities  (belt  filter  press,  sludge  centrifuges, 
and  sludge  drying  beds),  and  other  processes  (comminutors). 

Based  on  the  data  collected  by  PEEP,  emission  factors  could  be  developed  for 
most  of  the  above  process  steps  in  the  form  of  pounds  of  benzene  emitted  per  million  gallons 


6-68 


of  wastewater  treated  at  a  POTW.  One  type  of  process  unit  tested  (mechanically-mixed 
activated  sludge)  did  not  yield  air  emissions  of  benzene  above  the  detection  limit  in  the  tests 
performed;  however,  benzene  was  detected  in  the  wastewater  treated  by  the  tested  units. 
Additionally,  a  benzene  emission  factor  for  the  dechlorination  process  unit  could  only  be 
calculated  in  the  form  of  pounds  of  benzene  emitted  per  pound  of  benzene  in  the  wastewater 
influent  to  the  dechlorination  chamber.  Refer  to  Table  6-22  for  a  listing  of  the  emission 
factors.3,168 


With  one  exception,  all  of  the  emission  factors  presented  in  Table  6-21  represent 
uncontrolled  emissions  of  benzene.  However,  many  facilities  employ  measures  for  odor 
control  that  may  also  reduce  benzene  emissions  to  the  atmosphere  (see  discussion  in 
Section  6.6.3).  Most  of  the  facilities  tested  under  PEEP  did  employ  odor  control  methods; 
however,  benzene  emissions  after  control  were  not  measured. 

6.5.3  Control  Technologies  for  PQTWs 

In  general,  the  only  types  of  control  devices  and  techniques  found  at  POTWs  are 
the  scrubbers  and  covers  used  to  improve  the  odor  of  the  air  released  from  the  process  units. 
Using  the  information  provided  by  PEEP,  it  could  be  determined  which  process  units 
commonly  employ  covers  and  scrubbers. 

In  many  cases,  aerated  grit  chambers  are  covered  and  vented  to  a  scrubber. 
Primary  sedimentation  tanks  are  sometimes  covered  and  vented  to  a  scrubber;  however,  many 
of  these  units  are  uncovered.  Activated  sludge  units  may  sometimes  be  completely  covered 
and  vented  to  a  scrubber  or  partially  covered  and  vented  to  the  atmosphere.  This  practice  is 
more  common  if  a  pure  oxygen  system  is  employed.  Trickling  filter  units  are  sometimes 
covered  and  vented  to  a  scrubber.  Secondary  clarifiers  may  be  uncovered  or  partially  covered 
over  the  weir  discharge  area  with  no  vents.  Tertiary  filters  are  commonly  uncovered.

Chlorine  contact  tanks  are  either  uncovered  or  partially  covered.  Dechlorination 
units  are  often  enclosed  in  a  building  that  vents  to  a  scrubber.  Thickeners  are  commonly 
covered  and  sometimes  vented  to  a  scrubber.  Anaerobic  digesters  are  commonly  closed  under 
a  slight  pressure,  and  the  gas  is  sent  to  an  internal  combustion  engine  or  boiler  to  produce 
steam  or  electricity;  however,  some  digesters  may  vent  to  the  atmosphere.  Belt  filter  presses 
are  commonly  enclosed  in  a  building  that  vents  to  a  scrubber.  Sludge  centrifuges  are 
commonly  enclosed  and  vented  to  a  scrubber.  Drying  beds  are  most  commonly  uncovered.165 

6.5.4  Regulatory  Analysis 

At  the  present,  there  are  no  Federal  regulations  that  apply  directly  to  benzene  air 
emissions  from  POTWs.  However,  two  regulations  indirectly  apply:  the  HON  and  the 
Benzene  Waste  Operations  NESHAP.  Both  of  these  apply  directly  to  specific  types  of 
industrial  facilities  that  may  generate  wastewater  containing  benzene.  Both  regulations 
stipulate  that  these  facilities  may  comply  with  the  treatment  requirements  by  sending  then- 
wastewater  to  an  off-site  treatment  plant.  However,  the  off-site  plant  must  remove  or  destroy 
the  benzene  in  the  wastewater  to  the  level  specified  in  the  regulations.  Further  information  on 
the  regulation  can  be  found  in  Section  4.5.4  of  this  document. 

6.6  MUNICIPAL  SOLID  WASTE  LANDFILLS 

A  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  landfill  unit  is  a  discrete  area  of  land  or  an 
excavation  that  receives  household  waste,  but  is  not  a  land  application  unit  (i.e.  for  receiving 
sewage  sludge),  surface  impoundment,  injection  well,  or  waste  pile.  An  MSW  landfill  unit 
may  also  receive  other  types  of  wastes,  such  as  commercial  solid  waste,  nonhazardous  sludge, 
and  industrial  solid  waste.  Benzene  emissions  from  MSW  landfills  are  expected  to  originate 
from  the  non-household  sources  of  MSW.  The  types  of  waste  potentially  accepted  by  MSW 
landfills  include: 


MSW; 


6-72 


Household  hazardous  waste; 


•  Municipal  sludge; 

•  Municipal  waste  combustion  ash; 

•  Infectious  waste; 

•  Waste  tires; 

•  Industrial  non-hazardous  waste; 

•  Conditionally  exempt  small  quantity  generator  hazardous  waste; 

•  Construction  and  demolition  waste; 

•  Agricultural  wastes; 

•  Oil  and  gas  wastes;  and 

•  Mining  wastes. 

MSW  management  in  the  United  States  is  dominated  by  disposal  in  landfills. 
Approximately  67  percent  of  solid  waste  is  landfilled,  16  percent  is  incinerated,  and  17  percent 
is  recycled  or  composted.  There  were  an  estimated  5,345  active  MSW  landfills  in  the  United 
States  in  1992.  In  1990,  active  landfills  were  receiving  an  estimated  130  million  tons 
(118  million  Mg)  of  waste  annually.,  with  55  to  60  percent  reported  as  household  waste  and 
35  to  45  percent  reported  as  commercial  waste.1'0 

6.6.1  Process  Description  of  MSW  Landfills170 

There  are  three  major  designs  for  municipal  landfills:  the  area  method,  the 
trench  method,  and  the  ramp  method.  They  all  utilize  a  three-step  process,  which  includes 
spreading  the  waste,  compacting  the  waste,  and  covering  the  waste  with  soil.  The  area  fill 
method  involves  placing  waste  on  the  ground  surface  or  landfill  liner,  spreading  it  in  layers, 
and  compacting  it  with  heavy  equipment.  A  daily  soil  cover  is  spread  over  the  compacted 
waste.  The  trench  method  entails  excavating  trenches  designed  to  receive  a  day’s  worth  of 


6-73 


waste.  The  soil  from  the  excavation  is  often  used  for  cover  material  and  wind  breaks.  The 
ramp  method  is  typically  employed  on  sloping  land,  where  waste  is  spread  and  compacted  in  a 
manner  similar  to  the  area  method;  however,  the  cover  material  obtained  is  generally  from  the 
front  of  the  working  face  of  the  filling  operation.  The  trench  and  ramp  methods  are  not 
commonly  used,  and  are  not  the  preferred  methods  when  liners  and  leachate  collection  systems 
are  utilized  or  required  by  law. 

Modem  landfill  design  often  incorporates  liners  constructed  of  soil 
(e.g.,  recompacted  clay)  or  synthetics  (e.g.,  high  density  polyethylene)  or  both  to  provide  an 
impermeable  barrier  to  leachate  (i.e.,  water  that  has  passed  through  the  landfill)  and  gas 
migration  from  the  landfill. 

6.6.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  MSW  Landfills 

The  rate  of  benzene  emissions  from  a  landfill  is  governed  by  gas  production  and 
transport  mechanisms.  Production  mechanisms  involve  the  production  of  the  emission 
constituent  in  its  vapor  phase  through  vaporization,  biological  decomposition,  or  chemical 
reaction.  Transport  mechanisms  involve  the  transportation  of  benzene  in  its  vapor  phase  to  the 
surface  of  the  landfill,  through  the  air  boundary  layer  above  the  landfill,  and  into  the 
atmosphere.  The  three  major  transport  mechanisms  that  enable  transport  of  benzene  in  its 
vapor  phase  are  diffusion,  convection,  and  displacement.170 

Uncontrolled  Benzene  Emissions170 

Uncontrolled  benzene  emissions  from  a  landfill  may  be  estimated  by  utilizing 
the  series  of  equations  provided  below.  The  three  equations  estimate  the  following  three 
variables:  (1)  the  uncontrolled  methane  generation  rate,  (2)  the  uncontrolled  benzene  emission 
rate  (calculated  based  on  the  uncontrolled  methane  generation  rate),  and  (3)  the  uncontrolled 
benzene  mass  emission  rate  (calculated  based  on  the  uncontrolled  benzene  emission  rate).  As 


6-74 


indicated,  the  second  equation  utilizes  the  product  of  the  first  equation,  and  the  third  equation 
utilizes  the  product  of  the  second  equation. 

The  uncontrolled  CH4  volumetric  generation  rate  may  be  estimated  for 
individual  landfills  by  using  a  theoretical  first-order  kinetic  model  of  CH4  production 
developed  by  EPA.  This  model  is  known  as  the  Landfill  Air  Emissions  Estimation  model,  and 
it  can  be  accessed  from  the  EPA's  Control  Technology  Center  bulletin  board.  The  Landfill 

Air  Emissions  Estimation  model  equation  is  as  follows: 

QCH4  =  L0  R  (e-kc  -  e-*) 


where: 


Qch4 

4 

R 

e 

k 

c

Methane  volumetric  generation  rate  at  time  t,  m3/yr

active  life,  Mg/yr

Methane  generation  rate  constant,  yr'1 

Time  since  landfill  closure,  yrs  (c  =  0  for  active  landfills) 

Time  since  the  initial  refuse  placement,  yrs 


Site-specific  landfill  information  is  generally  available  for  variables  R,  c,  and  t. 
When  refuse  acceptance  rate  information  is  scant  or  unknown,  R  can  be  determined  by 
dividing  the  refuse  in  place  by  the  age  of  the  landfill.  Also,  nondegradable  refuse  should  be 
subtracted  from  the  mass  of  acceptance  rate  to  prevent  overestimation  of  CH4  generation.  The 


average  annual  acceptance  rate  should  only  be  estimated  by  this  method  when  there  is 
inadequate  information  on  the  actual  average  acceptance  rate. 


Values  for  variables  L0  and  k  must  be  estimated.  Estimation  of  the  potential 
CH4  generation  capacity  of  refuse  (LJ  is  generally  treated  as  a  function  of  the  moisture  and 
organic  content  of  the  refuse.  Estimation  of  the  CH4  generation  constant  (k)  is  a  function  of  a 
variety  of  factors,  including  moisture,  pH,  temperature,  and  other  environmental  factors,  and 


6-75 


landfill  operating  conditions.  Specific  CH4  generation  constants  can  be  computed  by  use  of 
EPA  Method  2E. 


The  Landfill  Air  Emission  Estimation  model  uses  the  proposed  regulatory  (see 
Section  6.6.4)  default  values  for  L0  and  k.  However,  the  defaults  were  developed  for 
regulatory  compliance  purposes.  As  a  result,  the  model  contains  conservative  L0  and  k  default 
values  in  order  to  protect  human  health,  to  encompass  a  wide  range  of  landfills,  and  to 
encourage  the  use  of  site-specific  data.  Therefore,  different  L0  and  k  values  may  be 
appropriate  in  estimating  landfill  emissions  for  particular  landfills  and  for  use  in  an  emissions 
inventory. 


A  higher  k  value  of  0.05/yr  is  appropriate  for  areas  with  normal  or  above 
normal  precipitation.  An  average  k  value  is  0.04/yr.  For  landfills  with  drier  waste,  a  k  value 
of  0.02/yr  is  more  appropriate.  An  L0  value  of  125  m3/Mg  (4,005  fF/ton)  refuse  is  appropriate 
for  most  landfills.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  in  order  to  comply  with  the  proposed 
regulation  (see  Section  6.6.4),  the  model  defaults  for  k  and  L0  must  be  applied  as  specified  in 
the  fmal  rule. 


Based  on  the  CH4  volumetric  generation  rate  calculated  above,  the  benzene 
volumetric  emission  rate  from  a  landfill  can  be  estimated  by  the  following  equation: 


Qbz  —  2  Qch4  *  CBZ/(lxl06) 

where: 

Qbz  =  Benzene  volumetric  emission  rate,  m3/yr 

Qch4  =  CH4  volumetric  generation  rate,  m3/yr  (from  the  Landfill  Air 

Emission  Estimation  model) 

CBZ  =  Benzene  concentration  in  landfill  gas,  ppmv 

2  =  Multiplication  factor  (assumes  that  approximately  50  percent  of 

landfill  gas  is  CH4) 


Uncontrolled  emission  concentrations  of  benzene  based  on  a  landfill  site’s 
history  of  co-disposal  with  hazardous  wastes  are  presented  in  Table  6-23. 3,170  An  analysis  of

benzene  emissions  data  based  on  the  co-disposal  history  of  the  individual  landfills  from  which 
the  concentration  data  were  derived  indicates  that  benzene  emissions  do  vary  with  the  amount 
of  hazardous  waste  co-disposed.  These  benzene  concentrations  have  already  been  corrected  for 
air  infiltration  and  can  be  used,  when  site-specific  data  are  not  available,  as  input  parameters 
(for  the  variable  CBZ)  in  the  above  equation  for  estimating  benzene  volumetric  emission  rates 
from  landfills. 


Then,  based  on  the  benzene  volumetric  emission  rate  calculated  using  the  above 
equation,  the  uncontrolled  mass  emission  rate  of  benzene  from  a  landfill  can  be  estimated  by 
the  following  equation: 


_ 78.113 _ 

(8.205x10  '5  m3-atm/mol-°K)  (1000  g)  (273  +  T) 


where: 


T 

78.113  = 


Uncontrolled  benzene  mass  emission  rate,  kg/yr 
Benzene  volumetric  emission  rate,  m3/yr 
Temperature  of  landfill  gas,  °C 
Molecular  weight  of  benzene 


This  equation  assumes  that  the  operating  pressure  of  the  system  is  approximately 
1  atmosphere.  If  the  temperature  of  the  landfill  gas  is  not  known,  a  temperature  of  25 °C  is 
recommended. 


Controlled  Benzene  Emissions 

As  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Section  6.6.3,  emissions  from  landfills  are 
typically  controlled  by  installing  a  gas  collection  system  and  destroying  the  collected  gas 
through  the  use  of  internal  combustion  engines,  flares,  or  turbines.  The  control  system  for 
landfills  consists  of  two  stages,  and  estimating  controlled  benzene  emissions  involves  the 
following  two  steps:  (1)  estimating  the  amount  of  benzene  that  is  not  collected  by  the  gas 
collection  system,  and  (2)  estimating  the  amount  of  collected  benzene  that  is  not  destroyed  by 
the  control  device. 


6-78 


The  amount  of  benzene  that  is  not  collected  by  the  gas  collection  system  may  be 
calculated  with  the  following  equation: 


Collection  Efficiency- 
TOO  , 


*  I 


BZ 


where: 

UCBZ  =  Uncollected  benzene  mass  emission  rate,  kg/yr 

Collection  Efficiency  =  Collection  efficiency  of  the  gas  collection 

system,  % 

IBZ  =  Uncontrolled  benzene  mass  emission  rate,  kg/yr 

If  the  site-specific  collection  efficiency  cannot  be  determined,  one  may  assume  that  a  gas 
collection  system  collects  75  percent  of  the  benzene  emitted  by  a  landfill.  Reported  collection 
efficiencies  typically  range  from  60  to  85  percent,  with  the  average  of  75  percent  being  most 
commonly  used  for  estimation  of  UCBZ. 


The  amount  of  benzene  that  is  not  destroyed  by  the  control  device  may  be 

calculated  with  the  following  equation: 


NDbz  =

BZ

Uncollected  benzene  mass  emissions  rate,  kg/yr 


If  the  site-specific  destruction  efficiency  of  a  control  device  cannot  be  determined,  one  may 
assume  the  destruction  efficiencies  provided  here.  Flares  have  been  documented  to  destroy 


6-79 


89.5  percent  of  the  benzene  routed  to  the  flare.  Internal  combustion  engines  have  been 
documented  to  destroy  83.8  percent  of  the  benzene  routed  to  the  internal  combustion  engine. 
After  promulgation  of  standards  proposed  in  1991  (see  Section  6.6.4),  however,  all  control 
devices  utilized  at  both  new  and  existing  landfills  may  be  required  to  reduce  the 
non-methanogenic  organic  compounds  (NMOCs)  in  the  collected  gas  by  98  weight  percent. 

Alternatively,  if  the  control  device  utilized  is  a  flare  and  the  heat  content  of  the 
landfill  gas  is  known,  the  emission  factor  provided  in  Table  6-24  may  be  used  to  calculate 
non-destroyed  benzene  emissions.3  Additionally,  if  the  control  device  is  an  industrial  boiler, 
refer  to  Section  7.4  for  information  regarding  controlling  benzene  emissions  from  an  industrial 
boiler  treating  landfill  gas. 

After  UCBZ  and  NDBZ  have  been  calculated,  these  two  variables  may  be  added 
together  to  calculate  the  total  benzene  mass  emission  rate  after  the  control  system. 

6.6.3  Control  Technologies  for  MSW  Landfills170 

Landfill  gas  collection  systems  are  either  active  or  passive  systems.  Active 
collection  systems  provide  a  pressure  gradient  in  order  to  extract  landfill  gas  by  use  of 
mechanical  blowers  or  compressors.  Passive  systems  allow  the  natural  pressure  gradient 
created  by  the  increase  in  landfill  pressure  from  landfill  gas  generation  to. mobilize  the  gas  for 

collection. 

Landfill  gas  control  and  treatment  options  include  (1)  combustion  of  the  landfill 
gas,  and  (2)  purification  of  the  landfill  gas.  Combustion  techniques  include  techniques  that  do 
not  recover  energy  (e.g.,  flares  and  thermal  incinerators)  and  techniques  that  recover  energy 
and  generate  electricity  from  the  combustion  of  the  landfill  gas  (e.g.,  gas  turbines  and  internal 
combustion  engines).  Boilers  can  also  be  employed  to  recover  energy  from  landfill  gas  in  the 
form  of  steam.  Flares  involve  an  open  combustion  process  that  requires  oxygen  for 
combustion;  the  flares  can  be  open  or  enclosed.  Thermal  incinerators  heat  an  organic  chemical

quality  natural  gas  by  using  adsorption,  absorption,  and  membranes. 

6.6.4  Regulatory  Analysis170 

Proposed  NSPS  and  emission  guidelines  for  air  emissions  from  MSW  landfills 
for  certain  new  and  existing  landfills  were  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  May  30,  1991, 
and  promulgated  March  12,  1996.  The  regulation  requires  that  Best  Demonstrated  Technology 
be  used  to  reduce  MSW  landfill  emissions  from  affected  new  and  existing  MSW  landfills  with 
a  design  capacity  greater  than  2.8  million  tons  (2.5  million  Mg  by  mass  or  2.5  million  cubic 
meters  by  volume)  of  MSW  and  emitting  greater  than  or  equal  to  55  tons/yr  (50  Mg/yr)  of 
NMOCs.  The  MSW  landfills  that  would  be  affected  by  the  proposed  NSPS  would  be  each  new 
MSW  landfill  and  each  existing  MSW  landfill  that  has  accepted  waste  since  May  30,  1991,  or 
that  has  capacity  available  for  future  use.  Control  systems  would  require  (1)  a  well-designed 
and  well-operated  gas  collection  system,  and  (2)  a  control  device  capable  of  reducing  NMOCs 
in  the  collected  gas  by  98  weight  percent. 

6.7  PULP,  PAPER,  AND  PAPERBOARD  INDUSTRY 

In  the  pulp,  paper,  and  paperboard  industry,  wood  pulp  is  chemically  treated  by 
dissolving  the  lignin  that  binds  the  cellulose  together  and  then  extracting  the  cellulose  to  make 
paper  and  paperboard.  Four  types  of  chemical  wood  pulping  processes  are  practiced  in  the 


6-81 


United  States.  Kraft  pulping  is  the  most  prevalent  type  of  process,  accounting  for  about 
85  percent  of  pulp  production.  Three  other  pulping  processes,  semi-chemical,  soda-mill,  and 
acid  sulfite,  account  for  4,  5,  and  6  percent  of  domestic  pulp  production,  respectively. 

Because  kraft  pulping  is  the  most  common  type  of  pulping  and  the  other  processes  are 
relatively  similar  to  it,  kraft  pulping  will  be  the  focus  of  this  section.  More  information  on  the 
other  three  pulping  processes  can  be  found  in  References  171  and  172. 

The  distribution  of  kraft  pulp  mills  in  the  United  States  in  1993  is  shown  in 
Table  6-25. 171  Kraft  pulp  mills  are  located  primarily  in  the  southeast,  whose  forests  provide 
over  60  percent  of  U.S.  pulpwood. 

The  U.S.  EPA  is  developing  benzene  emission  factors  for  pulp  and  papermaking 

processes  in  conjunction  with  MACT  standards  that  are  under  development.  Please  refer  to  the 
CHIEF  bulletin  board  for  benzene  emission  factors  that  will  be  forthcoming  from  the  MACT 
development  process.  More  information  on  the  MACT  effort  is  given  in  Section  6.7.2. 

6.7.1  Process  Description  for  Pulp,  Paper,  and  Paperboard  Making  Processes 

The  key  unit  operations  in  the  kraft  pulp  and  papermaking  process  include:

illustrated  in  the  diagram  of  a  typical  Kraft  pulping  and  recovery  process  (Figure  6-7)  and 
these  are  discussed  below  in  more  detail.171  Bleaching,  which  is  frequently  used  as  a  final  step, 
and  papermaking  are  discussed  at  the  end  of  this  section.

Cooking  and  Evaporation 

The  pulping  or  cooking  process  begins  with  the  digester,  which  is  a  pressure 
vessel  that  is  used  to  chemically  treat  chips  and  other  cellulosic  fibrous  materials  (such  as 
straw,  bagasse,  rags,  etc.)  under  elevated  temperature  and  pressure  to  separate  fibers  from 
each  other.  This  digestion  process  frequently  takes  place  in  an  aqueous  chemical  solution 
(frequently  a  white  liquor  solution  of  sodium  hydroxide  and  sodium  sulfide).  The  digestion 
process  may  be  batch  or  continuous.  After  cooking  the  liquor  containing  the  cooking 
chemicals  and  lignin  is  separated  from  the  pulp  and  sent  to  a  series  of  evaporators  for 
concentration. 


The  entire  digester  and  black  liquor  evaporator  system  includes  (a)  the  outlet  to 
the  incinerator  for  the  low-volume-high-concentration  (LVHC)  gases  that  are  commonly 
collected  and  routed  to  such  an  incineration  device,  (b)  chip  bin  exhaust  vents,  and  (c)  other 
miscellaneous  digester  and  evaporator  system  emission  points.  These  systems  were  combined 
since  all  kraft  mills  collect  and  incinerate  digester  relief  gases  (Vent  C),  digester  blow  tank  and 
accumulator  gases  (Vent  A  [continuous]  and  Vent  B  [batch  process]),  and  evaporator

condenser  vents  (Vent  J).  The  gases  at  these  emission  points  are  assumed  to  be  routed  to  the 
combustion  device  and  the  benzene  reduced  by  98  percent:171 

Deknotting  and  Prewash  Screening 

The  pulp  from  the  blow  tank  enters  a  knotter  where  knots  (pieces  of  undigested 
wood)  are  removed  prior  to  pulp  washing  in  order  to  produce  a  higher-quality  chemical  pulp 
(Emission  Point  D).171  The  pressure  knotter  and  pre-washer  screening  system  includes  all  the 
equipment  following  the  digester  system  (i.e.,  post  blow  tank)  and  preceding  the  first  stage  of 
brown  stock  washing.  There  are  two  types  of  knotters  typically  used  in  the  industry,  open  and 
pressurized.  The  air  flow  across  the  two  types  varies.  Open  knotters  have  a  greater  flow  and, 
therefore,  are  expected  to  have  higher  emissions  than  pressurized  knotters.  Knotter  systems 
typically  include  equipment  such  as  knot  drainer  hoods,  knot  tanks,  knot  elevators,  and 
screened  stock  chests.  Not  every  piece  of  equipment  is  necessarily  vented  to  the  atmosphere 
(Emission  Point  D).  The  emission  factor  presented  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  pressurized 
knotter  and  pre-washing  screening  system. 

Brown  Stock  Wash 

Pulp  that  has  been  through  the  blow  tank  and  knotter  is  then  washed  with  water 
in  the  brownstock  washing  process.  The  purpose  of  washing  is  to  remove  black  liquor  from 
the  pulp  so  as  to  recover  the  cooking  chemicals  sodium  and  sulfur  and  to  avoid  contamination 
during  subsequent  processing  steps.  The  brown  stock  washing  system  includes  all  the  brown 
stock  washers,  associated  filtrate  tanks,  vacuum  pump  exhausts,  and  any  interstage  storage 
chests  that  follow  pre-washer  screening.  In  washing,  water  (ffesh  or  recycled)  is  used  to  rinse 
the  pulp  and  recover  the  black  liquor.  There  are  two  basic  types  of  brown  stock  washing 
systems,  the  rotary  vacuum  drum  system  and  the  more  advanced  pressure  or  diffusion  washers. 
Emissions  from  the  washing  process  occur  as  compounds  entrained  in  the  pulp  and  black  liquor 
slurry  volatilize  (Emission  Point  E). 


6-86 


The  diluted  or  “weak”  black  liquor  is  recovered  in  a  washer  filtrate  tank  and 
sent  to  the  evaporator  area.  A  washer  foam  tank  is  typically  used  to  capture  the  foam 
separated  in  the  filtrate  tank.  Foam  is  formed  when  soap,  which  is  dissolved  by  the  caustic 
cooking  liquors,  goes  through  the  washing  process.  In  general,  defoaming  is  completed  in  the 
foam  tank  using  centrifugal  or  mechanical  force  to  break  up  the  foamed  mass.  This  force 
allows  air  trapped  in  the  foam  mass  to  vent  to  the  atmosphere  from  the  washer  foam  tank 
(Emission  Point  F).  The  defoamed  weak  black  liquor  is  routed  to  a  weak  black  liquor  storage 
tank  (Emission  Point  N)  before  it  is  typically  piped  to  the  evaporator  area.171 

p 

Screening  and  Decking 

Screening  is  performed  to  remove  oversized  panicles  from  the  pulp  slurry  after 
washing  the  pulp  and  prior  to  the  papermaking  process.  The  decker  is  a  washing  and 
thickening  unit  that  follows  brown  stock  washing  and  precedes  oxygen  delignification  (if 
present),  bleaching  (if  present),  or  the  paper  machines.  The  decker  unit  is  assumed  to  consist 
of  a  drum  and  a  filtrate  tank,  both  of  which  are  assumed  to  be  vented  to  the  atmosphere.  The 
emissions  from  each  pan  of  this  decker  unit  (i.e.,  both  the  washer  and  the  filtrate  tank)  fall 
within  the  range  of  emissions  reported  for  individually  tested  decker  washers  and  decker 
filtrate  tanks  and  is  therefore  assumed  to  be  representative. 

Decker  vents  may  be  either  hooded  (an  open  space  above  the  decker  with  a  hood 
covering  the  unit)  or  well-enclosed  (tightly  fitted  hood  around  the  unit,  no  open  space  except 
through  the  hood).  Hooded  deckers  are  likely  to  have  a  much  greater  air  flow  across  the 
decker,  and  therefore  are  expected  to  have  greater  emissions  (Emission  Point  G). 

Oxygen  Delignification 

Following  the  screening  and/or  decking,  delignification  of  pulp  with  oxygen 
(called  oxygen  delignification)  prior  to  bleaching  is  sometimes  used.  By  removing  more  of  the 


6-87 


lignin  from  the  pulp,  this  pretreatment  step  helps  to  reduce  the  amount  of  chemicals  used  by 
the  bleach  plant. 

The  oxygen  delignification  (OD)  system  begins  with  the  oxygen  reactor  and 
associated  blow  tank  (Emission  Point  H).  This  system  includes  a  series  of  two  washers  and/or 
presses  following  the  oxygen  reactor  blow  tank,  each  with  a  filtrate  tank.  An  interstage 
storage  chest  located  between  the  first  and  second  washers  and/or  presses  is  also  a  common 
configuration. 


Pulp  Storage  Tank 

Pulp  storage  tanks  refers  to  the  large  bulk  storage  tanks  following  OD  (if 

present)  or  brown  stock  washers  that  store  the  pulp  that  is  to  be  routed  to  the  bleach  plant  or  to 
the  paper  machines.  One  pulp  storage  tank  is  assumed  to  be  present  for  each  pulping  line. 

Chemical  Recovery  and  Causticizing 

The  chemical  recovery  and  causticizing  area  of  the  mill  is  where  strong  black 
liquor  recovered  from  the  evaporators  and  concentrators  is  converted  into  white  liquor  for 
reuse  in  the  digesters.  This  system  includes  all  the  equipment  associated  with  chemical 
recovery,  beginning  with  the  recovery  furnace,  the  smelt  dissolving  tanks  and  ending  with  the 
white  liquor  clarifier. 

The  chemical  recovery  and  causticizing  area  is  an  example  of  a  mill  system 
where  the  number  of  pieces  of  equipment  tested  was  driving  the  emissions.  In  other  words,  if 
one  mill  tested  all  the  components  of  the  recovery  loop,  that  mill  would  show  higher  emissions 
for  the  causticizing  area  system.  The  causticizing  area  system  can  be  broken  down  into  the 
following  subsystems: 


6-88 


Recovery  furnace.  Strong  black  liquor  from  the  multiple  effect  evaporators  is 
concentrated  from  50  to  about  70  percent  solids  either  in  a  concentrator  or  in  a  direct  contact 
evaporator  before  being  fired  in  a  recovery  furnace.  The  organics  in  the  liquor  provide  the 
energy  required  to  both  make  steam  and  to  capture  the  inorganic  chemicals  as  smelt  at  the 

bottom  of  the  furnace. 

Smelt  dissolving  tank.  Smelt  from  the  recovery  furnace  is  fed  into  the  tank 
where  it  is  dissolved  by  weak  wash.  Smelt  dissolving  tanks  are  typically  equipped  with  a 
venturi  scrubber  for  particulate  control.  Weak  wash  from  the  lime  mud  washer  is  often  used 
as  the  make-up  solution  in  the  scrubber,  with  spent  scrubbing  solution  flowing  into  the 
dissolving  tank. 

Green  liquor  clarifier.  Effluent  from  the  smelt  dissolving  tank  (green  liquor) 
enters  a  clarifier.  Dregs  are  drained  off  the  bottom  of  the  clarifier,  and  the  clarified  green 
liquor  passes  on  to  a  slaker. 

Slaker  and  causticizers.  Green  liquor  from  the  green  liquor  clarifier  is 
convened  into  white  liquor  by  adding  lime  in  the  slaker  and  causticizers.  Emissions  from  the 
causticizers  and  the  slaker  are  typically  routed  to  a  common  venturi  scrubber  with  green  liquor 
or  fresh  mill  water  as  the  scrubbing  medium. 

White  liquor  clarifier.  White  liquor  is  clarified  and  the  clarified  white  liquor  is 
sent  to  storage.  The  bottoms  from  the  white  liquor  clarifier  (lime  mud)  are  sent  to  a  mud 
washer. 


Lime  mud  washer  system.  Lime  mud  from  the  white  liquor  clarifier  is  washed 
here  with  fresh  mill  water.  The  wash  water  effluent  from  the  mud  washer  is  termed  weak 
wash  which  is  used  in  the  smelt  dissolving  tank.  The  lime  mud  washer  system  includes  the 
actual  washer  plus  all  associated  equipment  such  as  dilution  tanks,  pressure  filters,  and  mix 


6-89 


tanks.  If  condensates  are  used  as  the  wash  water,  the  emissions  could  be  much  higher, 
depending  on  the  quality  of  the  condensates. 

Lime  kiln.  The  lime  kiln  accepts  washed  lime  mud  and  calcines  it  to  produce 
lime.  This  lime  in  turn  is  fed  to  the  slaker,  and  the  cycle  is  repeated.  The  lime  kiln  is 
typically  equipped  with  a  venturi  scrubber  using  fresh  mill  water  as  the  scrubbing  medium  for 
particulate  emission  control.  Alternatively,  particulates  may  be  controlled  by  an  electrostatic 
precipitator  (ESP). 

Co-product  Recovery 

Turpentine  and  soap  (tall  oil)  are  two  saleable  coproducts  that  may  be 
byproducts  of  the  pulping  process.  Turpentine  is  recovered  from  digester  relief  gases  when 
resinous  softwoods  such  as  pines  are  pulped.  In  general,  the  digester  relief  gases  are  vented  to 
a  condenser  to  reduce  the  gas  moisture  content  and  to  a  cyclone  separator  to  remove  any  small 
wood  chips  or  fines.  Emissions  are  generated  as  turpentine  and  water  and  are  separated  in  a 
decanter.  These  emissions  are  released  through  the  turpentine  recovery  system  vent.  Tall  oils 
are  recovered  in  a  reactor,  but  emissions  are  expected  to  be  low  because  the  weak  black  liquor 
has  already  been  stripped  of  volatiles  in  the  evaporation  process  (Vent  M).171 

Bleaching 

Bleaching  is  the  process  of  further  delignifying  and  whitening  pulp  by 
chemically  treating  it  to  alter  the  coloring  matter  and  to  impart  a  higher  brightness. 

To  enhance  the  physical  and  optical  qualities  (whiteness  and  brightness)  of  the 
pulp,  one  of  two  types  of  chemical  bleaching  is  used.  The  first  type  of  bleaching,  called 
brightening,  uses  selective  chemicals  (such  as  hydrogen  peroxide)  that  destroy 
chromatographic  groups  but  do  not  materially  attack  the  lignin.  Brightening  produces  a 
product  with  a  temporary  brightness  (such  as  newspaper).  In  the  second  type  (true  bleaching), 


6-90 


oxidizing  chemicals  (such  as  chlorine,  chlorine  dioxide,  and  sodium  hypochlorite)  are  used  to 
remove  residual  lignin,  resulting  in  a  high-quality,  stable  paper  pulp.171 

The  most  common  bleaching  and  brightening  agents  are  chlorine,  chlorine 
dioxide,  hydrogen  peroxide,  oxygen,  caustic  (sodium  hydroxide)  and  sodium  hypochlorite. 
Typically,  the  pulp  is  treated  with  each  chemical  in  a  separate  stage.  One  example  stage  which 
illustrates  the  use  of  one  bleaching  agent  is  shown  in  Figure  6-8. 171  Each  stage  includes  a 
tower  where  the  bleaching  occurs  (Vent  A).  The  washer  (Vent  B)  removes  the  bleaching 
chemicals  and  dissolved  lignins  from  the  pulp  prior  to  entering  the  next  stage.  The  seal  tank 
(Vent  C)  collects  the  washer  effluent  to  be  used  as  wash  water  in  other  stages  or  to  be  sewered 
(Vent  D).171 


Paper  Machine 

Paper  machine  emissions  include  all  the  emissions  from  the  various  pieces  of 
equipment  following  pulp  storage  and/or  bleaching  that  are  used  to  turn  the  pulp  into  a  finished 
paper  product.  The  data  show  that  the  factor  driving  emissions  from  paper  machines  is  paper 
type  (i.e.,  unbleached  versus  bleached). 

Wastewater/Condensate  Treatment 

In  addition  to  process  vents,  emissions  also  occur  from  the  treatment  of 
wastewater  or  condensates  generated  during  the  making  of  pulp  and  paper  (Emission 
Point  O).171 

6J.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Pulp.  Paper  and  Papermaking  Processes 

* 

EPA  published  MACT  standards  for  the  pulp,  paperboard,  and  papermaking 
industry  on  April  15,  1998. 173  While  the  supporting  documentation  for  these  standards  does 

4 

not  specifically  call  out  benzene  as  a  major  pollutant  from  pulp  and  paper  mills,  it 


6-91 


Figure  6-8.  Typical  Down-flow  Bleach  Tower  and  Washer 
Source:  Reference  171. 


6-92 


does  mention  benzene  as  being  emitted  from  this  source  and  as  a  pollutant  that  would  be 
affected  by  VOC  reductions  achieved  by  compliance  with  the  standards. 

Emission  points  may  include  the  digester  relief  vents,  digester  blow  gas  vents, 
brownstock  or  pulp  washer,  screen,  as  well  as  bleaching  and  brightening.  Once  washing  has 
occurred,  it  is  expected  that  benzene  would  be  found  in  the  wastewater,  which  is  recycled  for 
use  throughout  the  process.  Such  uses  of  this  recycled  water  include  as  a  solvent  for  digesting 
chemicals,  as  the  pulp  digesting  medium,  as  pulp  waste  water,  and  as  a  diluent  for  screening, 
cleaning,  and  subsequent  pulp  processing.  Benzene  emissions  would  then  be  expected  from 
each  step  in  the  pulping  process  where  this  recycled  wastewater  is  used.  Note  that  the  extent 
of  benzene  emissions  (as  with  any  HAP)  during  the  pulping  process  is  a  function  of  the  level  of 
pulp  production,  type  of  digestion  (batch  or  continuous),  and  the  type  of  wood  pulped. 

6.8  SYNTHETIC  GRAPHITE  MANUFACTURING 

Synthetic  graphite  is  a  composite  of  coke  aggregate  (filler  particles),  petroleum 
pitch  (binder  carbon),  and  pores  (generally  with  a  porosity  of  20  to  30  percent).  Synthetic 
graphite  is  a  highly  refractory  material  that  has  been  thermally  stabilized  to  as  high  as  5,400 °F 
(3,000°C).  Graphite  is  a  valuable  structural  material  because  it  has  high  resistance  to  thermal 
shock,  does  not  melt,  and  possesses  structural  strength  at  temperatures  well  above  the  melting 
point  of  most  metals  and  alloys.  Applications  for  synthetic  graphite  include  the  following 
industries:  aerospace  (e.g.,  nose  cones,  motor  cases,  and  thermal  insulation),  chemical  (e.g., 
heat  exchangers  and  centrifugal  pumps  and  electrolytic  anodes  for  the  production  of  chlorine 
and  aluminum),  electrical  (e.g.,  telephone  equipment  products,  electrodes  in  fuel  cells  and 
batteries,  and  contacts  for  circuit  breakers  and  relays),  metallurgical  (e.g.,  electric  furnace 

electrodes  for  the  production  of  iron  and  steel,  furnace  linings,  ingot  molds,  and  extrusion 

> 

dies),  nuclear  (e.g.,  moderators,  thermal  columns,  and  fuel  elements),  and  miscellaneous 
(e.g.,  motion  picture  projector  carbons).174 


6-93 


The  number  of  facilities  manufacturing  synthetic  graphite  in  the  United  States 
was  not  identified. 

6.8.1  Process  Description  for  Synthetic  Graphite  Production 

Synthetic  graphite  is  produced  from  calcined  petroleum  coke  and  coal  tar  pitch 
through  a  series  of  processes  including  crushing,  sizing,  mixing,  cooling,  extrudings  baking, 
pitch  impregnation,  rebaking,  and  graphitization.  Throughout  the  process  of  thermal 
conversion  of  organic  materials  to  graphite,  the  natural  chemical  driving  forces  cause  the 
growth  of  larger  and  larger  fused-ring  aromatic  systems,  and  ultimately  result  in  the  formation 
of  the  stable  hexagonal  carbon  network  of  graphite.  A  process  flow  diagram  of  the  synthetic 
graphite  manufacturing  process  is  provided  in  Figure  6-9. 174,175 

Calcined  petroleum  coke  (i.e.,  raw  coke  that  has  been  heated  to  temperatures 
above  2,200°F  (1,200°C)  to  remove  volatiles  and  shrink  the  coke  to  produce  a  strong,  dense 
particle)  is  crushed  and  screened  to  obtain  uniform-sized  fractions  for  the  formulation  of  dry 
ingredient.  Coal  tar  pitch  is  stored  in  heated  storage  tanks  and  is  pumped  to  the  mixing 
process,  as  needed,  as  the  liquid  ingredient.  The  dry  ingredient  is  weighed  and  loaded,  along 
with  a  metered  amount  of  coal  tar  pitch,  into  a  heated  mixing  cylinder  (heated  to  at  least  320 °F 
[160°C]),  where  they  are  mixed  until  they  form  a  homogeneous  mixture.  During  the  mixing 
process,  vapors  (Vent  A  in  Figure  6-9)  are  ducted  to  a  stack  where  they  are  discharged  to  the 
atmosphere.174,175 


The  heated  mixture  is  sent  to  a  cooling  cylinder  which  rotates,  cooling  the 
mixture  with  the  aid  of  cooling  fans  to  a  temperature  slightly  above  the  softening  point  of  the 
binder  pitch.  Vapors  from  the  cooling  process  (Vent  B  in  Figure  6-9)  are  often  vented  to  a  PM 
control  device  before  being  vented  to  the  atmosphere.174,175 

The  cooled  mixture  is  charged  to  a  hydraulic  press,  then  pressed  through  a  die 
to  give  the  mixture  the  desired  shape  and  size.  The  extruded  mixture  is  referred  to  as  “green

stock.”  The  green  stock  is  placed  in  cooling  ponds,  where  it  is  further  cooled  and  awaits 
shipping  to  the  baking  process.175 

In  general,  for  producing  graphite  with  high-performance  applications,  the 
baking  process  consists  of  three  stages:  initial  baking,  pitch  impregnation,  and  rebaking.  In 
producing  graphite  for  some  lower-performance  applications,  the  pitch  impregnation  step  is 
excluded.  This  baking  process  chemically  changes  the  binder  pitch  within  the  green  stock  by 
forming  a  permanent  carbon  bond  between  the  coke  particles.  By  using  a  slow  heating  rate, 
the  baking  process  removes  most  of  the  shrinkage  in  the  product  associated  with  pyrolysis  of 
the  pitch  binder.  This  procedure  avoids  cracking  during  subsequent  graphitization  where  very 
fast  firing  rates  are  used.  The  impregnation  step  deposits  additional  coke  in  the  open  pores  of 
the  baked  stock,  thereby  improving  the  properties  of  the  subsequent  graphite  product.  The 
product  (later  referred  to  as  “rebaked  stock”)  is  a  solid,  rigid  body  that  is  much  harder  and 
stronger  than  the  green  stock.174,175 

Initial  baking  is  achieved  by  placing  the  green  stock  into  a  furnace  cell  (if  a 
recirculating  furnace  is  used)  or  a  can  (if  a  sagger  or  pit  furnace  is  used)  and  surrounding  the 
stock  with  a  suitable  pack  media  to  support  the  stock.  During  the  baking  process,  the  furnace 
temperature  is  increased  incrementally  (e.g.,  starting  at  350  to  400 °F  [175  to  200 °C]  and 
ending  at  400  to  570  °F  (200  to  300  °C]).  The  furnace  temperature  varies  according  to  the 
stock.  During  the  initial  baking  process,  fumes  (Vent  C  in  Figure  6-9)  are  often  vented  to  an 
afterburner  prior  to  discharge  to  the  atmosphere.175 

Baked  stock  is  pre-heated  in  a  pre-heater  to  a  desired  temperature  prior  to 
impregnation  with  pitch.  Fumes  from  the  pre-heater  (Vent  D  in  Figure  6-9)  are  often  vented  to 
an  afterburner  before  release  to  the  atmosphere.  The  pre-heated,  baked  stock  is  loaded  into 
autoclaves  where  a  vacuum  is  pulled.  Heated  petroleum  pitch  (or  coal  tar)  is  pumped  from 
storage  to  the  autoclave.  Vapors  from  the  storage  tank  for  the  heated  pitch  (Vent  D  in 
Figure  6-9)  are  often  vented  to  an  afterburner  prior  to  their  release  to  the  atmosphere.  The 
baked  stock  is  impregnated  with  pitch  under  increased  temperature  and  pressure.  The  pitch 


6-96 


impregnated  stock  is  then  stored  prior  to  the  rebaking  process.  Many  high-performance 
applications  of  graphite  (e.g.,  nuclear  and  aerospace  applications)  require  that  the  baked  stock 
be*  multiply  pitch-treated  to  achieve  the  greatest  possible  assurance  of  high  performance.174,175 

Rebaking  is  similar  to  initial  baking.  The  same  types  of  furnaces  are  used  for 
both  baking  and  rebaking.  The  pitch  impregnated  stock  is  heated  to  higher  temperatures  than 
the  green  stock  (e.g.,  from  210°F  [100°C]  to  900  to  1,800°F  [500  to  1,000°C]).  During  the 
rebake  process,  fumes  (Vent  E  in  Figure  6-9)  are  often  vented  to  an  afterburner.  Off-gases 
from  the  afterburner  are  vented  to  the  atmosphere.174,175 


The  last  step  in  the  manufacturing  process  is  graphitization.  In  this  step, 
electricity  is  used  to  create  temperatures,  by  resistance,  high  enough  to  cause  physical  and 
chemical  changes  in  the  rebaked  stock  (the  carbon  atoms  in  the  petroleum  coke  and  pitch  orient 
into  the  graphite  lattice  configuration).  As  a  result  of  this  step,  the  hard-baked  stock  becomes 
softer  and  machinable,  the  stock  becomes  an  electrical  conductor,  and  impurities  vaporize.174,175 


In  the  graphitization  step,  rebaked  stock  is  placed  in  a  furnace,  either 
perpendicular  or  parallel  to  the  direction  of  the  current  flow,  depending  on  the  type  of  furnace 
used.  Electricity  is  used  to  create  temperatures  in  the  stock  exceeding  4,350°F  (2,400°C),  and 
preferably  5,070  to  5,450°F  (2,800  to  3,000°C).  After  graphitization,  the  stock  (i.e., 
synthetic  graphite)  is  stored  for  on-site  use  or  shipment.  Fumes  from  the  furnace  are  vented  to 
the  atmosphere  (Vent  F  in  Figure  6-9). 174,175 


6.8.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Synthetic  Graphite  Production175 

There  is  limited  information  currently  available  about  benzene  emissions  from 
synthetic  graphite  production  plants.  Emission  factors  for  the  mixing  and  cooling  cylinders 
(Vents  A  and  B  in  Figure  6-9)  are  provided  in  Table  6-27. 175  Additionally,  one  emission  test 
report  indicated  that  benzene  is  emitted  from  the  initial  baking,  rebaking,  and

could  not  be  developed.175 

6.8.3  Control  Technologies  for  Synthetic  Graphite  Production175 

As  discussed  in  Section  6.9.1,  afterburners  may  be  used  to  control  emissions  of 
unbumed  hydrocarbons  from  the  initial  baking  and  rebaking  furnace  (Vents  C  and  E  in 
Figure  6-9),  as  well  as  the  preheater  and  heated  storage  tank  used  for  the  pitch  impregnation 
process  (Vent  D  in  Figure  6-9).  Data  regarding  the  use  of  afterburners  in  this  application  were 
not  available;  however,  it  is  likely  that  the  afterburners  would  reduce  benzene  emissions. 
Additionally,  an  ESP  may  be  used  to  control  particulate  emissions  from  the  cooling  cylinder; 
however,  it  is  unlikely  that  an  ESP  would  reduce  benzene  emissions. 

6.9  CARBON  BLACK  MANUFACTURE 

The  chemical  carbon  black  consists  of  finely  divided  carbon  produced  by  the 
thermal  decomposition  of  hydrocarbons  in  the  vapor  phase,  unlike  coke  that  is  produced  by  the 
pyrolysis  of  solids.  Carbon  black  is  a  major  industrial  chemical  used  primarily  as  a  reinforcing 
agent  in  rubber  compounds,  which  accounts  for  over  90  percent  of  its  use.  It  is  used  primarily 
m  tires  (both  original  equipment  and  replacement),  which  accounts  for  over  70  percent  of  its 
use.176  Other  tire-related  applications  include  inner  tubes  and  retreads.  Other  uses  include 
automotive  hoses  and  belts,  wire  and  cable,  roofing,  pigment  in  inks  and  coatings  and  as  a 
plastic  stabilizer.176  As  of  January  1994,  there  were  24  carbon  black  manufacturing  facilities  in 
the  United  States.  Over  75  percent  of  all  carbon  black  production  occurs  in  the  States  of  Texas 
and  Louisiana  (36  and  40  percent,  respectively).  The  location  of  all  facilities  and  their 
estimated  annual  production  capacities  in  1993  are  provided  in  Table  6-28. 177  The  manufacture 
of  carbon  black  is  of  potential  concern  for  benzene  emissions  because  the  predominantly  used 
production  process  involves  the  combustion  of  natural  gas  and  the  high-temperature  pyrolysis 
of  aromatic  liquid  hydrocarbons.

6.9.1 


Process  Description  for  Carbon  Black  Manufacture 


Approximately  90  percent  of  all  carbon  black  produced  in  the  United  States  is 
manufactured  by  the  oil-fumace  process,  a  schematic  of  which  is  given  in  Figure  6-10.  The 
process  streams  identified  in  Figure  6-10  are  defined  in  Table  6-29. 178,179  Generally,  all 
oil-furnace  carbon  black  plants  are  similar  in  overall  structure  and  operation.  The  most 
pronounced  differences  in  plants  are  primarily  associated  with  the  details  of  decomposition 
furnace  design  and  raw  product  processing.178 

In  the  oil-fumace  process,  carbon  black  is  produced  by  the  pyrolysis  of  an 
atomized  liquid  hydrocarbon  feedstock  in  a  refractory-lined  steel  furnace.  Processing 
temperatures  in  the  steel  furnace  range  from  2,408  to  2,804°F  (1,320  to  1,540°C).  The  heat 
needed  to  accomplish  the  desired  hydrocarbon  decomposition  reaction  is  supplied  by  the 
combustion  of  natural  gas.178 

Feed  materials  used  in  the  oil-fumace  process  consist  of  petroleum  oil,  natural 
gas,  and  air.  Also,  small  quantities  of  alkali  metal  salts  may  be  added  to  the  oil  feed  to  control 
the  degree  of  structure  of  the  carbon  black.179  The  ideal  raw  material  for  the  production  of 
modem,  high  structure  carbon  blacks  is  an  oil  which  is  highly  aromatic;  low  in  sulfur, 
asphaltenes  and  high  molecular  weight  resins;  and  substantially  ffeeiDf  suspended  ash,  carbon, 
and  water.  To  provide  maximum  efficiency,  the  furnace  and  burner  are  designed  to  separate, 
insofar  as  possible,  the  heat  generating  reaction  from  the  carbon  forming  reaction.  Thus,  the 
natural  gas  feed  (Stream  2  in  Figure  6-10)  is  burned  to  completion  with  preheated  air 
(Stream  3)  to  produce  a  temperature  of  2,408  to  2,804 °F  (1,320  to  1,540°C).  The  reactor  is 
designed  so  that  this  zone  of  complete  combustion  attains  a  swirling  motion,  and  the  oil  feed 
(Stream  1),  preheated  to  392  to  698 °F  (200  to  370°C),  is  sprayed  into  the  center  of  the  zone. 
Preheating  is  accomplished  by  heat  exchange  with  the  reactor  effluent  and/or  by  means  of  a 
gas-fired  heater.  The  oil  is  cracked  to  carbon  and  hydrogen  with  side  reactions  producing 
carbon  oxides,  water,  methane,  acetylene  and  other  hydrocarbon  products.  The  heat

transfer  from  the  hot  combustion  gases  to  the  atomized  oil  is  enhanced  by  highly  turbulent  flow 
in  the  reactor.179 

The  reactor  converts  35  to  65  percent  of  the  feedstock  carbon  content  to  carbon 
black,  depending  on  the  feed  composition  and  the  grade  of  black  being  produced.  The  yields 
are  lower  for  the  smaller  particle  size  grades  of  black.  Variables  that  can  be  adjusted  to 
produce  a  given  grade  of  black  include  operating  temperature,  fuel  concentration,  space 
velocity  in  the  reaction  zone,  and  reactor  geometry  (which  influences  the  degree  of  turbulence 
in  the  reactor).  A  typical  set  of  reactor  operating  conditions  for  high  abrasion  furnace  carbon 
black  is  given  in  Table  6-30. 179 

The  hot  combustion  gases  and  suspended  carbon  black  are  cooled  to  about 
1004°F  (540  °C)  by  a  direct  water  spray  in  the  quench  area,  which  is  located  near  the  reactor 
outlet.  The  reactor  effluent  (Stream  5  in  Figure  6-10)  is  further  cooled  by  heat  exchange  in  the 
air  and  oil  preheaters.  It  is  then  sent  to  a  quench  tower  where  direct  water  sprays  finally 
reduce  the  stream  temperature  to  446  °F  (230 °C). 

Carbon  black  is  recovered  from  the  reactor  effluent  stream  by  means  of  a  bag 
filter  unit.  The  raw  carbon  black  collected  in  the  bag  filter  unit  must  be  further  processed  to 
become  a  marketable  product.  After  passing  through  the  pulverizer,  the  black  has  a  bulk 
density  of  1 .50  to  3.68  lb/ft3  (24  to  59  kg/m3),  and  it  is  too  fluffy  and  dusty  to  be  transported. 

It  is  therefore  converted  into  pellets  or  beads  with  a  bulk  density  of  6.06  to  10.68  lb/ft3  (97  to 
171  kg/m3).  In  this  form,  it  is  dust-free  and  sufficiently  compacted  for  shipment. 

6.9.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Carbon  Black  Manufacture 

Although  no  emission  factors  are  readily  available  for  benzene  from  carbon 
black  manufacture,  one  carbon  black  manufacturer  with  annual  capacity  of  130  million  pounds 
(59  million  kg)  using  the  oil-furnace  process  reported  benzene  emissions  of  81,000  lb/yr 
(36,741  kg/yr)  for  1992,  which  translates  to  6.23X10*4  lb  (2.83xl0‘4  kg)  benzene  per  lb  (kg)

6. 10  RAYON-BASED  CARBON  FIBER  MANUFACTURE 


Rayon-based  carbon  fibers  are  used  primarily  in  cloth  for  aerospace 
applications,  including  phenolic  impregnated  heat  shields  and  in  carbon-carbon  composites  for 
missile  parts  and  aircraft  brakes.180  Due  to  their  high  carbon  content,  these  fibers  remain 
stable  at  very  high  temperatures. 

A  list  of  U.S.  producers  of  rayon-based  carbon  fibers  is  given  in  Table  6-32. 177

6.10.1  Process  Description  for  the  Ravon-Based  Carbon  Fiber  Manufacturing  Industry 

There  are  three  steps  in  the  production  process  of  rayon-based  carbon  cloth: 

•  Preparation  and  heat  treating; 

•  Carbonization;  and 

•  High  heat  treatment  (optional).180 

In  the  preparation  and  heat  treating  step,  the  rayon-based  cloth  is  heated  at  390  to  660 °F  (200 
to  350 °C).  Water  is  driven  off  (50  to  60  percent  weight  loss)  during  this  step  to  form  a  char 
with  thermal  stability.  In  the  carbonization  step,  the  cloth  is  heated  to  1,800  to  3,600°F 
(1,000  to  2,000°C),  where  additional  weight  is  lost  and  the  beginnings  of  a  carbon  layer 
structure  is  formed.  To  produce  a  high  strength  rayon-based  fiber,  a  third  step  is  needed. 

The  cloth  is  stretched  and  heat  treated  at  temperatures  near  5,400°F  (3, 000 °C). 180

6.10.2 


Benzene  Emissions  from  the  Ravon-Based  Carbon  Fiber  Manufacturing  Industry 


Benzene  emissions  occur  from  the  exhaust  stack  of  the  carbon  fabric  dryer, 
which  is  used  in  carbonization  of  the  heat  treated  rayon. 180  An  emission  factor  for  this  source 

is  given  in  Table  6-33. 181 

6.10.3  Controls  and  Regulatory  Analysis 

No  controls  or  regulations  were  identified  for  the  rayon-based  carbon  fiber 
manufacturing  industry. 

6.11  ALUMINUM  CASTING 

The  aluminum  casting  industry  produces  aluminum  products,  such  as  aluminum 
pans  for  marine  outboard  motors,  from  cast  molds.  Sections  6.11.1  through  6.12.3  describe 
the  aluminum  casting  process,  benzene  emissions  resulting  from  this  process,  and  air  emission 
control  devices  utilized  in  the  process  to  reduce  benzene  emissions. 

The  number  of  aluminum  casting  facilities  in  the  United  States  was  not 

identified. 

6.11.1  Process  Description  for  Aluminum  Casting  Facilities 

A  common  method  for  making  the  mold  for  aluminum  motor  parts  is  to  utilize 
polystyrene  foam  patterns  or  “positives”  of  the  desired  metal  part.  The  basic  principle  of  the 
casting  operation  involves  the  replacement  of  the  polystyrene  pattern  held  within  a  sand  mold 
with  molten  metal  to  form  the  metal  casting.  Figure  6-11  presents  a  simplified  flow  diagram 
for  a  typical  aluminum  casting  facility  utilizing  polystyrene  patterns.

The  aluminum  casting  process  essentially  consists  of  four  stages:  (1)  mold 
assembly,  (2)  casting  (i.e.,  mold  pouring,  mold  cooling,  and  cast  extraction),  (3)  cast  cleaning 
and  finishing  (i.e.,  casting  shakeout,  cast  cooling,  and  cast  cleaning  and  finishing),  and 
(4)  sand  handling  (i.e.,  sand  screening  and  cleaning).  A  polystyrene  foam  pattern  is  first 
coated  with  a  thin  layer  of  ceramic  material  for  stability.  The  polystyrene  foam  pattern  is 
placed  within  a  metal  flask.  Sand  is  poured  into  the  flask,  surrounding  and  covering  the 
pattern.  The  sand  is  compacted  around  the  polystyrene  pattern  to  form  the  mold.  Low  levels 
of  benzene  may  be  emitted  from  the  sand  fill  operation,  depending  on  the  residue  of  organic 
matter  remaining  on  the  sand  recycled  from  the  casting  shakeout  process  step.  These 
emissions  may  be  collected  in  a  fume  hood  and  vented  to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  A  in 
Figure  6-11). 


The  metal  flask  is  moved  to  the  pouring  station  where  molten  aluminum  is 
poured  into  the  mold.  The  foam  vaporizes  as  it  is  displaced  by  the  molten  aluminum,  which 
fills  the  cavitv  left  within  the  sand  mold.  A  majority  of  the  foam  vapors  migrate  into  the  sand 
and  remain  trapped  in  the  sand  until  the  casting  shakeout  process.  Some  of  the  vapors  are 
released  during  the  mold  pouring  event.  These  vapors  are  collected  in  a  fume  hood  and  vented 
to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  B  in  Figure  6-11). 

The  poured  molds  are  conveyed  within  the  flasks  along  a  cooling  conveyor, 
allowing  the  aluminum  casting  to  harden.  The  cooling  process  may  result  in  benzene 
emissions  (as  depicted  as  Vent  C  in  Figure  6-11). 

When  the  casting  has  formed  and  cooled  sufficiently,  the  cast  is  extracted  from 
the  metal  flask.  Benzene  may  be  emitted  from  this  process  step.  The  emissions  are  captured 
and  vented  to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  D  in  Figure  6-11). 

The  casting  and  flask  are  moved  to  the  casting  shake-out  area,  where  sand  used 
in  forming  the  mold  is  dumped  from  the  flask  and  removed  from  the  casting  by  utilizing 
vibration  to  loosen  the  compacted  sand.  The  collected  sand  (including  pieces  of  molding)  are 


6-110 


shaken,  breaking  up  the  sand  mold.  The  majority  of  benzene  emissions  occur  during  this  step. 
Vapors  released  by  breaking  the  sand  molds  are  captured  and  either  treated  with  a  catalytic 
incinerator  or  released  to  the  atmosphere  (Vent  E  in  Figure  6-11). 

The  shaken  sand  is  sent  through  a  screen,  then  transported  to  a  cleaning  process 
for  removal  of  remaining  residue,  such  as  a  fluidized  bed.  Benzene  emissions  may  be  emitted 
during  these  process  steps  (depicted  as  Vents  F  and  G  in  Figure  6-11).  The  cleaned  sand  is 
then  transported  to  storage  for  reuse  in  the  process. 

Meanwhile,  the  casting,  which  has  just  undergone  shakeout,  is  sent  through  a 
series  of  cooling,  cleaning,  and  finishing  steps  to  produce  a  final  product.  Benzene  may  be 

emitted  from  these  process  steps.  The  final  products  are  stored  to  await  shipping  off-site. 

6.11.2  Benzene  Emissions  From  Aluminum  Metal  Casting 

Benzene  emissions  from  aluminum  metal  casting  are  produced  by  the 
vaporization  of  the  polystyrene  foam  patterns  used  to  form  the  molds,  resulting  from  contact  of 
the  foam  with  molten  aluminum.  As  described  in  Section  6. 1 1 . 1 ,  the  polystyrene  foam  vapors 
migrate  into  the  sand  inside  the  mold,  becoming  trapped  in  the  sand  mold.  As  a  result,  most 
benzene  emissions  from  the  process  are  associated  with  sand  handling  activities,  such  as 
casting  shake-out  and  sand  screening.  However,  additional  benzene  is  emitted  from  the  casting 
steps,  including  mold  pouring,  mold  cooling,  and  cast  extraction. 

Two  test  reports  from  two  aluminum  casting  facilities  were  used  to  develop 
benzene  emission  factors.182,183  Both  facilities  utilized  polystyrene  foam  patterns  in  their 
casting  operations.  One  facility  was  equipped  with  a  catalytic  incinerator  on  its  casting 
shakeout  operation  and  a  fabric  filter  on  its  sand  cleaning  operation  (utilizing  a  fluidized  bed 
for  sand  cleaning).183  The  other  facility  was  equipped  with  fabric  filters  on  its  mold  assembly 
operation  (i.e.,  filling  the  flask  with  sand),  cast  extraction,  casting  shakeout,  and  sand 
screenmg  operations. 


6-111 


General  facility  benzene  emissions  were  measured  at  the  two  facilities.  For  one 
facility,  general  facility  emissions  consisted  of  emissions  from  the  mold  assembly,  cast 
extraction,  casting  shakeout,  sand  screening,  and  sand  storage  operations,  all  of  which  were 
controlled  by  fabric  filters.182  For  the  other  facility,  general  facility  emissions  consisted  of 
emissions  from  the  mold  assembly,  mold  pouring,  cast  extraction,  casting  shakeout,  and  sand 
cleaning  operations,  and  only  the  cleaning  operation  was  controlled  with  a  fabric  filter.183 
Additionally,  benzene  emissions  from  the  casting  shakeout  operation  were  measured  both 
before  and  after  the  catalytic  incinerator,  yielding  a  benzene  control  efficiency  of  89  percent. 183 
The  emission  factors  associated  with  these  emission  data  are  shown  in  Table  6-34. 181 

6.11.3  Control  Technologies  for  Aluminum  Casting  Operations 

Fabric  filters  are  most  commonly  utilized  for  controlling  emissions  from 
aluminum  casting  operations;  however,  these  control  devices  are  not  utilized  for  controlling 
benzene  emissions  but  are  rather  used  to  control  fugitive  dust  emissions  from  sand  handling. 
The  only  control  device  identified  for  controlling  benzene  emissions  is  a  catalytic  incinerator. 
As  specified  in  Section  6.12.2,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  catalytic  incinerators  achieve 
89  percent  reduction  in  benzene  emissions. 

No  regulations  were  identified  that  control  emissions  of  benzene  from  aluminum 
casting  operations.  However,  a  MACT  standard  for  control  of  HAPs  from  secondary 
aluminum  facilities  is  currently  underway. 

6.12  ASPHALT  ROOFING  MANUFACTURING 

The  asphaltic  material  that  is  obtained  toward  the  end  of  the  process  of 
fractional  distillation  of  crude  oil  is  mainly  used  as  asphalt  paving  concrete  (discussed  in 
Section  7.9)  and  for  asphalt  roofing.  The  asphalt  roofing  manufacturing  process  and  the 
emissions  associated  with  its  manufacture  are  described  in  this  section.

In  1992,  there  were  98  asphalt  roofing  manufacturing  plants  operating  in  the 
United  States.  A  list  of  all  current  facilities,  as  identified  by  the  Asphalt  Roofing 
Manufacturers  Association,  is  provided  in  Table  6-35. 184  Total  national  production  in  1993  of 
asphalt  roofing  materials  (saturated  felts)  was  estimated  at  557,487  tons  (505,749  Mg).184 
States  containing  a  relatively  significant  number  of  roofing  plants  include  California  (14), 

Texas  (14),  Ohio  (6),  and  Alabama  (5).  These  four  states  contain  approximately  40  percent  of 
the  total  number  of  roofing  facilities.  The  majority  of  all  plants  nationwide  are  located  in 
urban  as  opposed  to  rural  areas. 


6.12.1  Process  Description 

The  production  of  asphalt  roofing  materials  is  common  owing  to  the  widespread 
usage  of  these  materials  in  the  United  States.  The  asphalt  roofing  industry  manufactures 
asphalt-saturated  felt  rolls,  shingles,  roll  roofing  with  mineral  granules  on  the  surface,  and 
smooth  roll  roofing,  which  may  contain  a  small  amount  of  mineral  dust  or  mica  on  the  surface. 
Most  of  these  products  are  used  in  roof  construction,  but  small  quantities  are  used  in  walls  and 
other  building  applications.185 


The  asphaltic  material  derived  from  crude  oil  and  used  to  make  asphalt  roofing 
products  is  also  called  asphalt  flux.  The  handling  and  storing  of  asphalt  flux  is  a  potential 
source  of  benzene  emissions.  Asphalt  is  normally  delivered  to  an  asphalt  roofing  plant  in  bulk 
by  pipeline,  tanker  truck,  or  railcar.  Bulk  asphalt  delivered  in  liquid  form  may  range  in 
temperature  from  200  to  400  °F  (93  to  204  °C),  depending  on  the  type  of  asphalt  and  local 


practice 


186-188 


With  bulk  liquid  asphalt,  the  most  common  method  of  unloading  is  to  couple  a 
flexible  pipe  to  the  tanker  and  pump  the  asphalt  directly  into  the  appropriate  storage  tanks. 
The  tanker  cover  is  partially  open  during  the  transfer.  Because  this  is  a  closed  system,  the

only  potential  sources  of  emissions  are  the  tanker  and  the  storage  tanks.  The  magnitude  of  the 
emissions  from  the  tanker  is  at  least  partially  dependent  on  how  far  the  cover  is  opened. 

Another  unloading  procedure,  of  which  there  are  numerous  variations,  is  to 
pump  the  hot  asphalt  into  a  large  open  funnel  that  is  connected  to  a  surge  tank.  From  the  surge 
tanks,  the  asphalt  is  pumped  directly  into  storage  tanks.  Emission  sources  under  the  surge  tank 
configuration  are  the  tanker,  the  interface  between  the  tanker  and  the  surge  tank,  the  surge 
tank,  and  the  storage  tanks.  The  quantity  of  emissions  depends  on  the  asphalt's  temperature 
and  characteristics. 

After  delivery,  asphalt  flux  is  usually  stored  at  124  to  174°F  (51  to  79°C), 
although  storage  temperatures  of  up  to  450°F  (232 °C)  have  been  noted.  The  lower 
temperatures  are  usually  maintained  with  steam  coils  in  the  tanks.  Oil-  or  gas-fired  preheaters 
are  used  to  maintain  the  asphalt  flux  at  temperatures  above  200 °F  (93  X).186* 188 

Asphalt  is  transferred  within  a  roofing  plant  by  closed  pipeline.  Barring  leaks, 
the  only  potential  emissions  sources  are  at  the  end-points  of  the  pipes.  These  end-points  are 
the  storage  tanks,  the  asphalt  heaters  (if  not  the  closed  tube  type),  and  the  air-blowing  stills. 

Asphalt  flux  is  used  to  make  two  roofing  grades  of  asphalt:  saturant  and 
coating.  Saturant  and  coating  asphalts  are  primarily  distinguished  by  the  differences  in  then- 
softening  points.  The  softening  point  of  saturant  asphalts  is  between  104  to  165°F  (40  and 
74°C);  coating  asphalts  soften  at  about  230°F  (110°C).  These  softening  points  are  achieved 
by  “blowing”  hot  asphalt  flux,  that  is,  by  blowing  air  through  tanks  of  hot  asphalt  flux. 

The  configuration  of  a  typical  air-blowing  operation  is  shown  in  Figure  6-12. 185 
This  operation  consists  primarily  of  a  blowing  still,  which  is  a  tank  with  a  sparger  fitted  near 
its  base.  The  purpose  of  the  sparger  is  to  increase  contact  between  the  blowing  air  and  the 
asphalt.  Air  is  forced  through  holes  in  the  sparger  into  a  tank  of  hot  (400  to  470°F  [204  to 
243  °C])  asphalt  flux.  The  air  rises  through  the  asphalt  and  initiates  an  exothermic  oxidation

reaction.  Oxidizing  the  asphalt  has  the  effect  of  raising  its  softening  temperature,  reducing 
penetration,  and  modifying  other  characteristics.  Inorganic  salts  such  as  ferric  chloride  (FeCl3) 
may  be  used  as  catalysts  added  to  the  asphalt  flux  during  air  blowing  to  better  facilitate  these 
transformations . 1 85 

The  time  required  for  air  blowing  of  asphalt  depends  on  a  number  of  factors 
including  the  characteristics  of  the  asphalt  flux,  the  characteristics  desired  for  the  finished 
product,  the  reaction  temperature,  the  type  of  still  used,  the  air  injection  rate,  and  the 
efficiency  with  which  the  air  entering  the  still  is  dispersed  throughout  the  asphalt.  Blowing 
times  may  vary  in  duration  from  30  minutes  to  12  hours,  with  typical  times  from  1  to 
4.5  hours.185-186 

Asphalt  blowing  is  a  highly  temperature-dependent  process  because  the  rate  of 
oxidation  increases  rapidly  with  increases  in  temperature.  Asphalt  is  preheated  to  400  to 
470°F  (204  to  2i?°C)  before  blowing  is  initiated  to  ensure  that  the  oxidation  process  will  start 
an  acceptable  rate.  Conversion  does  take  place  at  lower  temperatures  but  is  much  slower. 
Because  of  the  exothermic  nature  of  the  reaction,  the  asphalt  temperature  rises  as  blowing 
proceeds.  This,  in  turn,  further  increases  the  reaction  rate.  Asphalt  temperature  is  normally 
kept  at  about  500  °F  (260  °C)  during  blowing  by  spraying  water  onto  the  surface  of  the  asphalt, 
although  external  cooling  may  also  be  used  to  remove  the  heat  of  reaction.  The  allowable 
upper  limit  to  the  reaction  temperature  is  dictated  by  safety  considerations,  with  the  maximum 
temperature  of  the  asphalt  usually  kept  at  least  50°F  (28 °C)  below  the  flash  point  of  the  asphalt 
being  blown.186 


The  design  and  location  of  the  sparger  in  the  blowing  still  governs  how  much  of 
the  asphalt  surface  area  is  physically  contacted  by  the  injected  air,  and  the  vertical  height  of  the 
still  determines  the  time  span  of  this  contact.  Vertical  stills,  because  of  their  greater  head 
(asphalt  height),  require  less  air  flow  for  the  same  amount  of  asphalt-air  contact.  Both  vertical 
and  horizontal  stills  are  used  for  asphalt  blowing,  but  in  new  construction,  the  vertical  type  is 
preferred  by  the  industry  because  of  the  increased  asphalt-air  contact  and  consequent  reduction 


6-120 


in  blowing  times.186  Also,  asphalt  losses  from  vertical  stills  are  reported  to  be  less  than  those 
from  horizontal  stills.  All  recent  blowing  still  installations  have  been  of  the  vertical  type. 

Asphalt  blowing  can  be  either  a  batch  process  or  a  continuous  operation; 
however,  the  majority  of  facilities  use  a  batch  process.  Asphalt  flux  is  sometimes  blown  by 
the  oil  refiner  or  asphalt  processor  to  meet  the  roofing  manufacturer's  specifications.  Many 
roofmg  manufacturers,  however,  purchase  the  flux  and  carry  out  their  own  blowing. 

Blown  asphalt  (saturant  and  coating  asphalt)  is  used  to  produce  asphalt  felt  and 
coated  asphalt  roofmg  and  siding  products  in  the  processes  depicted  in  Figures  6-13  and 
6-14. 185  The  processes  are  identical  up  to  the  point  where  the  material  is  to  be  coated.  A  roll 
of  felt  is  installed  on  the  felt  reel  and  unwound  onto  a  dry  floating  looper.  The  dry  floating 
looper  provides  a  reservoir  of  felt  material  to  match  the  intermittent  operation  of  the  felt  roller 
to  the  continuous  operation  of  the  line.  Felt  is  unwound  from  the  roll  at  a  faster  rate  than  is 
reouired  hv  the  line  with  the  excess  being  stored  in  the  drv  looper.  The  flow  of  felt  to  the  line 

A  »  w  v  1 

and  the  tension  on  the  material  is  kept  constant  by  raising  the  top  set  of  rollers  and  increasing 
looper  capacity.  The  opposite  action  occurs  when  a  new  roll  is  being  put  on  the  felt  reel  and 
spliced  in,  and  the  felt  supply  ceases  temporarily.  There  are  no  benzene  emissions  generated 

in  this  processing  step.186 

Following  the  dry  looper,  the  felt  enters  the  saturator,  where  moisture  is  driven 
out  and  the  felt  fibers  and  intervening  spaces  are  filled  with  saturant  asphalt.  (If  a  fiberglass 
mat  web  is  used  instead  of  felt,  the  saturation  step  and  the  subsequent  drying-in  process  are 
bypassed.)  The  saturator  also  contains  a  looper  arrangement,  which  is  almost  totally 
submerged  in  a  tank  of  asphalt  maintained  at  a  temperature  of  450  to  500  °F  (232  to  260  °C). 
The  absorbed  asphalt  increases  the  sheet  or  web  weight  by  about  150  percent.  At  some  plants, 
the  felt  is  sprayed  on  one  side  with  asphalt  to  drive  out  the  moisture  prior  to  dipping.  This 
approach  reportedly  results  in  higher  benzene  emissions  than  does  use  of  the  dip  process 
alone.186  The  saturator  is  a  significant  benzene  emissions  source  within  the  asphalt  roofing 
process.

The  saturated  felt  then  passes  through  drying-in  drums  and  onto  the  wet  looper, 
sometimes  called  the  hot  looper.  The  drying-in  drums  press  surface  saturant  into  the  felt. 
Depending  on  the  required  final  product,  additional  saturant  may  also  be  added  at  this  point. 
The  amount  of  absorption  depends  on  the  viscosity  of  the  asphalt  and  the  length  of  time  the 
asphalt  remains  fluid.  The  wet  looper  increases  absorption  by  providing  time  for  the  saturant 
asphalt  to  penetrate  the  felt.  The  wet  looper  operation  has  been  shown  to  be  a  significant 
source  of  organic  particulate  emissions  within  the  asphalt  roofing  process;  however,  the 
portion  that  is  benzene  has  not  been  defined.186,187 

If  saturated  felt  is  being  produced,  the  sheet  passes  directly  to  the  cool-down 
section.  For  surfaced  roofmg  products,  however,  the  saturated  felt  is  carried  to  the  coater 
station,  where  a  stabilized  asphalt  coating  is  applied  to  both  the  top  and  bottom  surfaces. 
Stabilized  coating  contains  a  mineral  stabilizer  and  a  harder,  more  viscous  coating  asphalt  that 
has  a  higher  softening  point  than  saturant  asphalt.  The  coating  asphalt  and  mineral  stabilizer 
are  mixed  in  approximately  equal  proportions.  The  mineral  stabilizer  may  consist  of  finely 
divided  lime,  silica,  slate  dust,  dolomite,  or  other  mineral  materials. 

The  weight  of  the  fmished  product  is  controlled  by  the  amount  of  coating  used. 
The  coater  rollers  can  be  moved  closer  together  to  reduce  the  amount  of  coating  applied  to  the 
felt,  or  separated  to  increase  it.  Many  modem  plants  are  equipped  with  automatic  scales  that 
weigh  the  sheets  in  the  process  of  manufacture  and  warn  the  coater  operator  when  the  product 
is  running  under  or  over  specifications.  The  coater  is  a  significant  emissions  source  within  the 
roofmg  production  process.  It  releases  asphalt  fumes  containing  organics,  some  of  which  may 
be  benzene  compounds.186,187 

The  function  of  the  coater-mixer  is  to  mix  coating  asphalt  and  a  mineral 
stabilizer  in  approximately  equal  proportions.  The  stabilized  asphalt  is  then  piped  to  the 
coating  pan.  The  asphalt  is  piped  in  at  about  450  to  500 °F  (232  to  260 °C),  and  the  mineral 
stabilizer  is  delivered  by  screw  conveyor.  There  is  often  a  preheater  immediately  ahead  of  the 


6-124 


coater-mixer  to  dry  and  preheat  the  material  before  it  is  fed  into  the  coater-mixer.  This 
eliminates  moisture  problems  and  also  helps  to  maintain  the  temperature  above  320  °F  (160°C) 
in  the  coater-mixer.  The  coater-mixer  is  usually  covered  or  enclosed,  with  an  exhaust  pipe  for 
the  air  displaced  by  (or  carried  with)  the  incoming  materials:  The  coater-mixer  is  viewed  as  a 
potential  source  of  benzene  emissions,  but  not  a  significant  one.186,187 

The  next  step  in  the  production  of  coated  roofing  products  is  the  application  of 
mineral  surfacing.  The  surfacing  section  of  the  roofing  line  usually  consists  of  a 
multi-compartmented  granule  hopper,  two  parting  agent  hoppers,  and  two  large  press  rollers. 
The  hoppers  are  fed  through  flexible  hoses  from  one  or  more  machine  bins  above  the  line. 
These  machine  bins  provide  temporary  storage  and  are  sometimes  called  surge  bins.  The 
granule  hopper  drops  colored  granules  from  its  various  compartments  onto  the  top  surface  of 
the  moving  sheet  of  coated  felt  in  the  sequence  necessary  to  produce  the  desired  color  pattern 
on  the  roofing.  This  step  is  not  required  for  smooth-surfaced  products.186 

Parting  agents  such  as  talc  and  sand  (or  some  combination  thereof)  are  applied 
to  the  top  and  back  surfaces  of  the  coated  sheet  from  parting  agent  hoppers.  These  hoppers  are 
usually  of  an  open-top,  slot-type  design,  slightly  longer  than  the  coated  sheet  is  wide,  with  a 
screw  arrangement  for  distributing  the  parting  agent  uniformly  throughout  its  length.  The  first 
hopper  is  positioned  between  the  granule  hopper  and  the  first  large  press  roller,  and  8  to 
12  inches  (0.2  to  0.3  m)  above  the  sheet.  It  drops  a  generous  amount  of  parting  agent  onto  the 
top  surface  of  the  coated  sheet  and  slightly  over  each  edge.  Collectors  are  often  placed  at  the 
edges  of  the  sheet  to  pick  up  this  overspray,  which  is  then  recycled  to  the  parting  agent 
machine  bin  by  open  screw  conveyor  and  bucket  elevator.  The  second  parting  agent  hopper  is 
located  between  the  rollers  and  dusts  the  back  side  of  the  coated  sheet.  Because  of  the  steep 
angle  of  the  sheet  at  this  point,  the  average  fall  distance  from  the  hopper  to  the  sheet  is  usually 
somewhat  greater  than  on  the  top  side,  and  more  of  the  material  falls  off  the  sheet.186 

In  a  second  technique  used  to  apply  backing  agent  to  the  back  side  of  a  coated 
sheet,  a  hinged  trough  holds  the  backing  material  against  the  coated  sheet  and  only  material 


6-125 


that  will  adhere  to  the  sheet  is  picked  up.  When  the  roofing  line  is  not  operating,  the  trough  is 
tipped  back  so  that  no  parting  agent  will  escape  past  its  lower  lip. 

Immediately  after  application  of  the  surfacing  material,  the  sheet  passes  through 
the  cool-down  section.  Here  the  sheet  is  cooled  rapidly  by  passing  it  around  water-cooled 
rollers  in  an  abbreviated  looper  arrangement.  Usually,  water  is  also  sprayed  on  the  surfaces  of 
the  sheet  to  speed  the  cooling  process.  The  cool-down  section  is  not  a  source  of  benzene 
emissions. 


Following  cooling,  self-sealing  coated  sheets  usually  have  an  asphalt  seal-down 
strip  applied.  The  strip  is  applied  by  a  roller,  which  is  partially  submerged  in  a  pan  of  hot 
sealant  asphalt.  The  pan  is  typically  covered  to  minimize  fugitive  emissions.  No  seal-down 
strip  is  applied  to  standard  shingle  or  roll-goods  products.  Some  products  are  also  texturized 
at  this  point  by  passing  the  sheet  over  an  embossing  roll  that  imparts  a  pattern  to  the  surface  of 

,1  _  ,  _  »  -l  '186 

uic  coaicu  snec i . 

The  cooling  process  for  both  asphalt  felt  and  coated  sheets  is  completed  in  the 
next  processing  station,  known  as  the  finish  looper.  In  the  finish  looper,  sheets  are  allowed  to 
cool  and  dry  gradually.  Secondly,  the  finish  looper  provides  line  storage  to  match  the 
continuous  operation  of  the  line  to  the  intermittent  operation  of  the  roll  winder.  It  also  allows 
time  for  quick  repairs  or  adjustments  to  the  shingle  cutter  and  stacker  during  continuous  line 
operation  or,  conversely,  allows  cutting  and  packaging  to  continue  when  the  line  is  down  for 
repair.  Usually,  this  part  of  the  process  is  enclosed  to  keep  the  fmal  cooling  process  from 
progressing  too  rapidly.  Sometimes,  in  cold  weather,  heated  air  is  also  used  to  retard  cooling. 
The  finish  looper  is  not  viewed  as  a  source  of  benzene  emissions.186 

Following  finishing,  asphalt  felt  to  be  used  in  roll  goods  is  wound  on  a  mandrel, 
cut  to  the  proper  length,  and  packaged.  When  shingles  are  being  made,  the  material  from  the 
finish  looper  is  fed  into  the  shingle-cutting  machine.  After  the  shingles  have  been  cut,  they  are 


6-126 


moved  by  roller  conveyor  to  manual  or  automatic  packaging  equipment.  They  are  then  stacked 
on  pallets  and  transferred  by  forklift  to  storage  areas  or  waiting  trucks.186 

6.12.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  Asphalt  Roofing  Manufacture 

The  primary  benzene  emission  sources  associated  with  asphalt  roofing  are  the 
asphalt  air-blowing  stills  (and  associated  oil  knockout  boxes)  and  the  felt  saturators.186  An 
emission  factor  for  benzene  emissions  from  the  blowing  stills  or  saturators  is  given  in 
Table  6-36. 189  Additional  potential  benzene  emission  sources  may  include  the  wet  looper,  the 
coater-mixer,  the  felt  coater,  the  seal-down  stripper,  and  air-blown  asphalt  storage  tanks. 

Minor  fugitive  emissions  are  also  possible  from  asphalt  flux  and  blown  asphalt  handling  and 
transfer  operations. 186’188,190 

Process  selection  and  control  of  process  parameters  have  been  promoted  to 
minimize  uncontrolled  emissions,  including  oenzene,  rrom  asphalt  air-blowing  stills,  asphalt 
saturators,  wet  loopers,  and  coaters.  Process  controls  include  the  use  of:184 

•  Dip  saturators,  rather  than  spray  or  spray-dip  saturators; 

•  Vertical  stills,  rather  than  horizontal  stills; 

•  Asphalts  that  inherently  produce  low  emissions; 

•  Higher-flash-point  asphalts; 

•  Reduced  temperatures  in  the  asphalt  saturant  pan; 

•  Reduced  asphalt  storage  temperatures;  and 

•  Lower  asphalt-blowing  temperatures. 

Dip  saturators  have  been  installed  for  most  new  asphalt  roofing  line  installations 
in  recent  years,  and  this  trend  is  expected  to  continue.  Recent  asphalt  blowing  still 
installations  have  been  almost  exclusively  of  the  vertical  type  because  of  its  higher  efficiency 
and  lower  emissions.  Vertical  stills  occupy  less  space  and  require  no  heating  during  oxidizing

(if  the  temperature  of  the  incoming  flux  is  above  400  °F  [204  °C]).  Vertical  stills  are  expected 
to  be  used  in  new  installations  equipped  with  stills  and  in  most  retrofit  situations.186 

Asphalt  fluxes  with  lower  flash  points  and  softening  points  tend  to  have  higher 
emissions  of  organics  because  these  fluxes  generally  have  been  less  severely  cracked  and 
contain  more  low-boiling  fractions.  Many  of  these  light  ends  can  be  emitted  during  blowing. 
Limiting  the  minimum  softening  and  flash  points  of  asphalt  flux  should  reduce  the  amount  of 
benzene-containing  fumes  generated  during  blowing  because  less  blowing  is  required  to 
produce  a  saturant  or  coating  asphalt.  Saturant  and  coating  asphalts  with  high  softening  points 
should  reduce  benzene  emissions  from  felt  saturation  and  coating  operations.  However, 
producing  the  higher  softening  point  asphalt  flux  requires  more  blowing,  which  increases 
uncontrolled  emissions  from  the  blowing  operation.186 

Although  these  process-oriented  emissions  control  measures  are  useful, 
emissions  capture  equipment  and  add-on  emissions  control  equipment  are  also  necessary  in 
asphalt  roofing  material  production  facilities.  The  capture  of  potential  benzene  emissions  from 
asphalt  blowing  stills,  asphalt  storage  tanks,  asphalt  tank  truck  unloading,  and  the  coater-mixer 
can  and  is  being  achieved  in  the  industry  by  the  use  of  enclosure  systems  around  the 
emissions-producing  operations.  The  enclosures  are  maintained  under  negative  pressure,  and 
the  contained  emissions  are  ducted  to  control  devices.186  Potential  emissions  from  the 
saturator,  wet  looper,  and  coater  are  generally  collected  by  a  single  enclosure  by  a  canopy  type 
hood  or  an  enclosure/hood  combination. 

No  regulations  were  identified  to  control  benzene  emissions  from  hot-mix 

asphalt  plants. 

6.13  CONSUMER  PRODUCTS/BUILDING  SUPPLIES 

This  section  covers  benzene  emissions  from  the  application  and  use  of  consumer 
products  rather  than  from  the  manufacture  of  such  products.  Because  the  types  of  consumer 


6-129 


products  to  which  benzene  emissions  are  attributed  are  so  extensive,  no  list  of  manufacturers  is 
presented  here. 

Benzene  emissions  from  the  use  of  consumer  products  and  building  supplies 
have  been  reported  in  the  literature.  One  indoor  air  quality  data  base  for  organic  compounds, 
shows  that  indoor  benzene  levels  have  been  measured  in  residences,  commercial  buildings, 
hospitals,  schools,  and  office  buildings.  Substantiated  sources  of  these  benzene  emissions  were 
attributed  to  tobacco  smoke,  adhesives  (including  epoxy  resins  and  latex  caulks),  spot  cleaners, 
paint  removers,  particle  board,  foam  insulation,  inks,  photo  film,  auto  exhaust,  and  wood 
stain.191,192  Although  benzene  emissions  were  detected  from  these  consumer  sources,  no 
specific  benzene  emission  factors  were  identified.  In  addition  to  these  consumer  sources, 
detergents  have  been  identified  as  another  possible  source  of  benzene  emissions.191 

In  another  report,  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (most  likely  including  benzene)  were 
listed  as  a  constituent  in  certain  automotive  detailing  and  cleaning  products,  including 
body-cleaning  compounds  and  engine  cleaners/degreasers/parts  cleaners.  However,  no 
specific  emission  levels  were  given.192 

Naphtha  (CAS  number  8030-30-6)  is  a  mixture  of  a  small  percentage  of 
benzene,  toluene,  xylene,  and  higher  homologs  derived  from  coal  tar  by  fractional  distillation. 
Among  its  applications,  naphtha  is  used  as  thinner  in  paints  and  varnishes  and  as  a  solvent  in 
rubber  cement.106  Because  naphtha  contains  a  small  percentage  of  benzene,  some  benzene 
emissions  would  be  expected  from  these  products.  However,  no  qualifiable  benzene  emissions 
from  naphtha-containing  products  were  identified. 

The  main  control  for  reducing  benzene  emissions  from  consumer  products  is 
reformulation,  such  as  substituting  water  or  lower- VOC-emitting  alternatives.192

The  federal  government  and  several  states  are  currently  working  on  regulations 
for  the  benzene  (or  VOC)  content  of  consumer  products.  Consumer  products  is  a  very  diverse 
category  and  the  products  are  used  in  a  variety  of  applications.193

EMISSIONS  FROM  COMBUSTION  SOURCES 


The  following  stationary  point  and  area  combustion  source  categories  have  been 
identified  as  sources  of  benzene  emissions:  medical  waste  incinerators  (MWIs),  sewage  sludge 
incinerators  (SSIs),  hazardous  waste  incinerators,  external  combustion  sources  (e.g.,  utility 
boilers,  industrial  boilers,  and  residential  stoves  and  furnaces),  internal  combustion  sources, 
secondary  lead  smelters,  iron  and  steel  foundries,  portland  cement  kilns,  hot-mix  asphalt 
plants,  and  open  burning  (of  biomass,  tires,  and  agricultural  plastic).  For  each  combustion 
source  category,  the  following  information  is  provided  in  the  sections  below:  (1)  a  brief 
characterization  of  the  U.S.  population,  (2)  the  process  description,  (3)  benzene  emissions 
characteristics,  and  (4)  control  technologies  and  techniques  for  reducing  benzene  emissions.  In 
some  cases,  the  current  Federal  regulations  applicable  to  the  source  category  are  discussed. 


7 . 1  MEDICAL  WASTE  INCINERATORS 

MWIs  bum  wastes  produced  by  hospitals,  veterinary  facilities,  crematories,  and 
medical  research  facilities.  These  wastes  include  both  infectious  (“red  bag”  and  pathological) 
medical  wastes  and  non-infectious,  general  housekeeping  wastes.  The  primary  purposes  of 
MWIs  are  to  (1)  render  the  waste  innocuous,  (2)  reduce  the  volume  and  mass  of  the  waste,  and 
(3)  provide  waste-to-energy  conversion.  The  total  number  and  capacity  of  MWIs  in  the  United 
States  is  unknown;  however,  it  is  estimated  that  90  percent  of  the  6,872  hospitals  (where  the 
majority  of  MWIs  are  located)  in  the  nation  have  some  type  of  on-site  incinerator,  if  only  a 
small  unit  for  incinerating  special  or  pathological  waste.194  The  document  entitled  Locating 
and  Estimating  Air  Toxic  Emissions  From  Sources  of  Medical  Waste  Incinerators ,  contains  a 


7-1 


more  detailed  characterization  of  the  MWI  industry,  including  a  partial  list  of  the  U.S.  MWI 
population. 


Three  main  types  of  incinerators  are  used  for  medical  waste  incineration: 
controlled-air,  excess-air,  and  rotary  kiln.  Of  the  incinerators  identified,  the  majority 
( >  95  percent)  are  controlled-air  units.  A  small  percentage  ( < 2  percent)  are  excess-air.  Less 
than  1  percent  were  identified  as  rotary  kiln.  The  rotary  kiln  units  tend  to  be  larger,  and 
typically  are  equipped  with  air  pollution  control  devices.  Approximately  2  percent  of  the  total 
population  identified  were  found  to  be  equipped  with  air  pollution  control  devices.195 

7.1.1  Process  Description:  Medical  Waste  Incinerators195 

Controlled-Air  Incinerators 

Controlled-air  incineration  is  the  most  widely  used  MWI  technology  and  it  now 

dominates  the  market  for  new  systems  at  hospitals  and  similar  medical  facilities.  This 
technology  is  also  known  as  starved-air  incineration,  two-stage  incineration,  and  modular 
combustion.  Figure  7-1  presents  a  schematic  diagram  of  a  typical  controlled-air  unit.195 

Combustion  of  waste  in  controlled-air  incinerators  occurs  in  two  stages.  In  the 
first  stage,  waste  is  fed  into  the  primary,  or  lower,  combustion  chamber,  which  is  operated 
with  less  than  the  stoichiometric  amount  of  air  required  for  combustion.  Combustion  air  enters 
the  primary  chamber  from  beneath  the  incinerator  hearth  (below  the  burning  bed  of  waste). 

This  air  is  called  primary  or  underfire  air.  In  the  primary  (starved-air)  chamber,  the  low  air- 
to-fuel  ratio  dries  and  facilitates  volatilization  of  the  waste,  and  most  of  the  residual  carbon  in 
the  ash  bums.  At  these  conditions,  combustion  gas  temperatures  are  relatively  low  (1,400  to 
1,800°F  [760  to  980  °C]). 

In  the  second  stage,  excess  air  is  added  to  the  volatile  gases  formed  in  the 
primary  chamber  to  complete  combustion.  Secondary  chamber  temperatures  are  higher  than

primary  chamber  temperatures—typically  1,800  to  2,000°F  (980  to  1,095°C).  Depending  on 
the  heating  value  and  moisture  content  of  the  waste,  additional  heat  may  be  needed.  This  can 
be  provided  by  auxiliary  burners  located  at  the  entrance  to  the  secondary  (upper)  chamber  to 
maintain  desired  temperatures. 

l 

Waste  feed  capacities  for  controlled-air  incinerators  range  from  about  75  to 
6,500  lb/hour  (0.6  to  50  kg/min)  (at  an  assumed  fuel  heating  value  of  8,500  Btu/lb 
[19,700  kJ/kg]).  Waste  feed  and  ash  removal  can  be  manual  or  automatic,  depending  on  the 
unit  size  and  options  purchased.  Throughput  capacities  for  lower  heating  value  wastes  may  be 
higher  because  feed  capacities  are  limited  by  primary  chamber  heat  release  rates.  Heat  release 
rates  for  controlled-air  incinerators  typically  range  from  15,000  to  25,000  Btu/hr-ft3 
(430,000  to  710,000  kJ/hr-m3). 

Because  of  the  low  air  addition  rates  in  the  primary  chamber  and  corresponding 

lovv  Hue  gab  velocities  (and  turbulence),  the  amount  of  solids  entrained  in  the  gases  leaving  the 

primary  chamber  is  low.  Therefore,  the  majority  of  controlled-air  incinerators  do  not  have 
add-on  gas  cleaning  devices. 

Excess-Air  Incinerators 

Excess-air  incinerators  are  typically  small  modular  units.  They  are  also  referred 
to  as  batch  incinerators,  multiple-chamber  incinerators,  and  “retort”  incinerators.  Excess-air 
incinerators  are  typically  a  compact  cube  with  a  series  of  internal  chambers  and  baffles. 
Although  they  can  be  operated  continuously,  they  are  usually  operated  in  a  batch  mode. 

Figure  7-2  presents  a  schematic  for  an  excess-air  unit.195  Typically,  waste  is 
manually  fed  into  the  combustion  chamber.  The  charging  door  is  then  closed  and  an 
afterburner  is  ignited  to  bring  the  secondary  chamber  to  a  target  temperature  (typically  1,600 
to  1,800°F  [870  to  980°C]).  When  the  target  temperature  is  reached,  the  primary  chamber 
burner  ignites.  The  waste  is  dried,  ignited,  and  combusted  by  heat  provided  by  the  primary

chamber  burner,  as  well  as  by  radiant  heat  from  the  chamber  walls.  Moisture  and  volatile 
components  in  the  waste  are  vaporized  and  pass  (along  with  combustion  gases)  out  of  the 
primary  chamber  and  through  a  flame  port  that  connects  the  primary  chamber  to  the  secondary 
or  mixing  chamber. 

Secondary  air  is  added  through  the  flame  port  and  is  mixed  with  the  volatile 
components  in  the  secondary  chamber.  Burners  are  also  installed  in  the  secondary  chamber  to 
maintain  adequate  temperatures  for  combustion  of  volatile  gases.  Gases  exiting  the  secondarv 
chamber  are  directed  to  the  incinerator  stack  or  to  a  control  device.  When  the  waste  is 
consumed,  the  primary  burner  shuts  off.  Typically,  the  afterburner  shuts  off  after  a  set  time. 
After  the  chamber  cools,  ash  is  manually  removed  from  the  primary  chamber  floor  and  a  new 
charge  of  waste  can  be  added. 

Incinerators  designed  to  bum  general  hospital  waste  operate  at  excess  air  levels 
of  up  to  300  percent.  If  only  pathological  wastes  are  combusted,  excess  air  levels  near 
100  percent  are  more  common.  The  lower  excess  air  helps  maintain  higher  chamber 
temperature  when  burning  high-moisture  waste.  Waste  feed  capacities  for  excess-air 
incinerators  are  usually  500  lb/hr  (3.8  kg/min)  or  less. 

Rotary  Kiln  Incinerators 

Rotary  kiln  incinerators,  like  the  other  types,  are  designed  with  a  primary 
chamber  where  the  waste  is  heated  and  volatilized  and  a  secondary  chamber  where  combustion 
of  the  volatile  fraction  is  completed.  The  primary  chamber  consists  of  a  slightly  inclined, 
rotating  kiln  in  which  waste  materials  migrate  from  the  feed  end  to  the  ash  discharge  end.  The 
waste  throughput  rate  is  controlled  by  adjusting  the  rate  of  kiln  rotation  and  the  angle  of 
inclination.  Combustion  air  enters  the  primary  chamber  through  a  port.  An  auxiliary  burner 
is  generally  used  to  start  combustion  and  maintain  desired  combustion  temperatures.  Both  the 
primary  and  secondary  chambers  are  usually  lined  with  acid-resistant  refractory  brick.  Refer 
to  Figure  7-9  of  this  chapter  for  a  schematic  diagram  of  a  typical  rotary  kiln  incinerator.  In 


7-6 


Figure  7-9,  the  piece  of  equipment  referred  to  as  the  “afterburner”  is  the  equivalent  of  the 
“secondary  chamber”  referred  to  in  this  section. 

Volatiles  and  combustion  gases  pass  from  the  primary  chamber  to  the  secondary 
chamber.  The  secondary  chamber  operates  at  excess  air.  Combustion  of  the  volatiles  is 
completed  in  the  secondary  chamber.  Because  of  the  turbulent  motion  of  the  waste  in  the 
primary  chamber,  solids  burnout  rates  and  particulate  entrainment  in  the  flue  gas  are  higher  for 
rotary  kiln  incinerators  than  for  other  incinerator  designs.  As  a  result,  rotary  kiln  incinerators 
generally  have  add-on  gas  cleaning  devices. 


7.1.2  Benzene  Emissions  From  Medical  Waste  Incinerators 

There  is  limited  information  currently  available  on  benzene  emissions  from 
MWIs.  One  emission  factor  for  benzene  emissions  is  provided  in  Table  7-1. 196  This  factor 

represent:  benzene  emissions  during  combustion  of  both  general  hospital  wastes  and 
pathological  wastes. 

7.1.3  Control  Technologies  for  Medical  Waste  Incinerators 


Most  control  of  air  emissions  of  organic  compounds  is  achieved  by  promoting 
complete  combustion  by  following  good  combustion  practice  (GCP).  In  general,  the 
conditions  of  GCP  are  as  follows:194 


Uniform  wastefeed; 


•  Adequate  supply  and  good  air  distribution  in  the  incinerator; 


Sufficiently  high  incinerator  gas  temperatures  (>  1,500°F  [>815°C]); 

Good  mixing  of  combustion  gas  and  air  in  all  zones; 

Minimization  of  PM  entrainment  into  the  flue  gas  leaving  the  incinerator; 
and

•  Temperature  control  of  the  gas  entering  the  air  pollution  control  device 
to  450  °F  (230 °C)  or  less. 

Failure  to  achieve  complete  combustion  of  organic  materials  evolved  from  the 
waste  can  result  in  emissions  of  a  variety  of  organic  compounds.  The  products  of  incomplete 
combustion  (PICs)  range  from  low-molecular-weight  hydrocarbons  (e.g.,  methane,  ethane,  or 
benzene)  to  high-molecular- weight  organic  compounds  (e.g.,  dioxins/furans).  In  general, 
adequate  oxygen,  temperature,  residence  time,  and  turbulence  will  minimize  emissions  of  most 
organics. 


Control  of  organics  may  be  partially  achieved  by  using  acid  gas  and  PM  control 
devices.  To  date,  most  MWIs  have  operated  without  add-on  air  pollution  control  devices.  A 
small  percentage  (approximately  2  percent)  of  MWIs  do  use  air  pollution  control  devices,  most 
frequently  wet  scrubbers  and  fabric  filters.  Fabric  filters  provide  mainly  PM  control.  Other 
PM  control  technologies  include  venturi  scrubbers  and  electrostatic  precipitators  (ESPs).  In 
addition  to  wet  scrubbing,  dry  sorbent  injection  and  spray  dryer  absorbers  have  also  been  used 
for  acid  gas  (i.e.,  hydrogen  chloride  [HC1]  and  sulfur  dioxide  [S02])  control.  Because  it  is  not 
documented  that  acid  gas/PM  control  devices  provide  reduction  in  benzene  emissions  from 
MWIs,  further  discussion  of  these  types  of  control  devices  is  not  provided  in  this  section. 
Locating  and  Estimating  Air  Toxic  Emissions  From  Sources  of  Medical  Waste  Incinerators  ,194 
contains  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  acid  gas/PM  air  pollution  control  devices  utilized 
for  MWIs,  including  schematic  diagrams. 

7.1.4  Regulatory  Analysis 

Air  emissions  from  MWIs  are  not  currently  regulated  by  Federal  standards. 
However,  Section  129  of  the  CAA  requires  that  standards  be  established  for  new  and  existing 
MWIs.  Standards  for  MWIs  were  proposed  under  Section  129  of  the  CAA  on 
February  27,  1995  (38  FR  10654).  Section  129  requires  that  the  standards  include  emission 
limits  for  HC1,  SO:,  and  CO,  among  other  pollutants.  Section  129  also  specifies  that  the 
standards  may  require  monitoring  of  surrogate  parameters  (e.g.,  flue  gas  temperature).  Thus, 


7-9 


the  standards  may  require  GCP,  which  would  likely  result  in  benzene  emissions  reduction. 
Additionally,  the  standards  may  require  acid  gas/PM  control  device  requirements,  which  may 
result  in  some  benzene  emissions  reduction. 

7.2  SEWAGE  SLUDGE  INCINERATORS 

There  are  approximately  170  sewage  sludge  incineration  (SSI)  plants  operating 
in  ihe  United  Suica.  The  three  main  types  of  SSIs  are:  multiple-hearth  furnaces  (MHF). 
fluidized-bed  combustors  (FBC),  and  electric  infrared  incinerators.  Some  sludge  is  co-fired 
with  municipal  solid  waste  in  combustors,  based  on  refuse  combustion  technology.  Refuse 
co-fired  with  sludge  in  combustors  based  on  sludge  incinerating  technology  is  limited  to  MHFs 
only.197 

Over  80  percent  of  the  identified  operating  sludge  incinerators  are  of  the 
multiple-hearth  design.  About  15  percent  are  FBCs  and  3  percent  are  electric  infrared 
incinerators.  The  remaining  combustors  co-fire  refuse  with  sludge.  Most  sludge  incinerators 
are  located  in  the  Eastern  United  States,  although  there  are  a  significant  number  on  the  West 
Coast.  New  York  has  the  largest  number  of  facilities,  with  33.  Pennsylvania  and  Michigan 
have  the  next  largest  number  of  facilities,  with  21  and  19  sites,  respectively.197,198  Locating 
and  Estimating  Air  Toxics  Emissions  for  Sewage  Sludge  Incinerators  contains  a  diagram 
showing  the  geographic  distribution  of  the  existing  population.198 

The  three  main  types  of  sewage  sludge  incinerators  are  described  in  the 
following  sections.  Single  hearth  cyclone,  rotary  kiln,  wet  air  oxidation,  and  co-incineration 
are  also  briefly  discussed.

7.2.1 


Process  Description:  Sewage  Sludge  Incinerators197’198 


Multiple-Hearth  Furnaces 

A  cross-sectional  diagram  of  a  typical  MHF  is  shown  in  Figure  7-3.198  The 
basic  MHF  is  a  vertically  oriented  cylinder.  The  outer  shell  is  constructed  of  steel,  lined  with 
refractory,  and  surrounds  a  series  of  horizontal  refractory  hearths.  A  hollow  cast-iron  rotating 
shaft  runs  through  the  center  of  the  hearths.  Cooling  air  is  introduced  into  the  shaft,  which 
extend  above  the  hearths.  Attached  to  the  central  shaft  are  the  rabble  arms,  which  extend 
above  the  hearths.  Each  rabble  arm  is  equipped  with  a  number  of  teeth  approximately  6  inches 
in  length  and  spaced  about  10  inches  apart.  The  teeth  are  shaped  to  rake  the  sludge  in  a  spiral 
motion,  alternating  in  direction  from  the  outside  in  to  the  inside  out,  between  hearths.  Burners 
are  located  in  the  sidewalls  of  the  hearths  to  provide  auxiliary  heat. 

In  most  MKFs,  partially  dewatered  sludge  is  fed  onto  the  perimeter  of  the  top 

hearth.  The  rabble  arms  move  the  sludge  through  the  incinerator  by  raking  the  sludge  toward 
the  center  shaft,  where  it  drops  through  holes  located  at  the  center  of  the  hearth.  In  the  next 
hearth,  the  sludge  is  raked  in  the  opposite  direction.  This  process  is  repeated  in  all  of  the 
subsequent  hearths.  The  effect  of  the  rabble  motion  is  to  break  up  solid  material  to  allow 
bener  surface  contact  with  heat  and  oxygen.  A  sludge  depth  of  about  1  inch  is  maintained  in 
each  hearth  at  the  design  sludge  flow  rate. 

Scum  may  also  be  fed  to  one  or  more  hearths  of  the  incinerator.  Scum  is  the 
material  that  floats  on  wastewater.  It  is  generally  composed  of  vegetable  and  mineral  oils, 
grease,  hair,  waxes,  fats,  and  other  materials  that  will  float.  Scum  may  be  removed  from 
many  treatment  units,  including  pre-aeration  tanks,  skimming  tanks,  and  sedimentation  tanks. 
Quantities  of  scum  are  generally  small  compared  to  those  of  other  wastewater  solids. 

Ambient  air  is  first  ducted  through  the  central  shaft  and  its  associated  rabble 
arms.  A  portion  or  all  of  this  air  is  then  taken  from  the  top  of  the  shaft  and  recirculated  into

the  lower-most  hearth  as  preheated  combustion  air.  Shaft  cooling  air  that  is  not  circulated  back 
into  the  furnace  is  ducted  into  the  stack  downstream  of  the  air  pollution  control  devices.  The 
combustion  air  flows  upward  through  the  drop  holes  in  the  hearths,  countercurrent  to  the  flow 
of  the  sludge,  before  being  exhausted  from  the  top  hearth.  Air  enters  the  bottom  to  cool  the 
ash.  Provisions  are  usually  made  to  inject  ambient  air  directly  into  the  middle  hearths  as  well. 

i 

Overall,  an  MHF  can  be  divided  into  three  zones.  The  upper  hearth  comprises 
the  drying  znnp  where  most  of  the  moisture  in  the  sludge  is  evaporated.  The  temperature  in 
the  drying  zone  is  typically  between  800  and  1,400°F  (425  and  760°C).  Sludge  combustion 
occurs  in  the  middle  hearth  (second  zone)  as  the  temperature  is  increased  to  1,100  to  1,700°F 
(600  to  930 °C).  The  combustion  zone  can  be  further  subdivided  into  the  upper-middle  hearth, 
where  the  volatile  gases  and  solids  are  burned,  and  the  lower-middle  hearth,  where  most  of  the 
fixed  carbon  is  combusted.  The  third  zone,  made  up  of  the  lower-most  hearth,  is  the  cooling 
zone.  In  this  zone,  the  ash  is  cooled  as  its  heat  is  transferred  to  the  incoming  combustion  air. 

Under  normal  operating  conditions.  50  to  100  percent  excess  air  must  be  added 
to  an  MHF  in  order  to  ensure  complete  combustion  of  the  sludge.  Besides  enhancing  contact 
between  fuel  and  oxygen  in  the  furnace,  these  relatively  high  rates  of  excess  air  are  necessary 
to  compensate  for  normal  variations  in  both  the  organic  characteristics  of  the  sludge  feed  and 
the  rate  at  which  it  enters  the  incinerator.  When  the  supply  of  excess  air  is  inadequate,  only 
partial  oxidation  of  the  carbon  will  occur,  with  a  resultant  increase  in  emissions  of  CO,  soot, 
and  hydrocarbons.  Too  much  excess  air,  on  the  other  hand,  can  cause  increased  entrainment 
of  paniculate  and  unnecessarily  high  auxiliary  fuel  consumption. 

Fluidized-Bed  Combustors 

Figure  7-4  shows  a  cross-sectional  diagram  of  an  FBC.198  FBCs  consist  of  a 
vertically  oriented  outer  shell  constructed  of  steel  and  lined  with  refractory.  Tuyeres  (nozzles 
designed  to  deliver  blasts  of  air)  are  located  at  the  base  of  the  furnace  within  a  refractory-lined 
grid.  A  bed  of  sand,  approximately  2.5  feet  (0.75  meters)  thick,  rests  upon  the  grid.  Two

7-14 


general  configurations  can  be  distinguished  on  the  basis  of  how  the  fluidizing  air  is  injected 
into  the  furnace.  In  the  “hot  windbox”  design,  the  combustion  air  is  first  preheated  by  passing 
through  a  heat  exchanger,  where  heat  is  recovered  from  the  hot  flue  gases.  Alternatively, 
ambient  air  can  be  injected  directly  into  the  furnace  from  a  cold  windbox. 


Partially  dewatered  sludge  is  fed  into  the  lower  portion  of  the  furnace.  Air 
injected  through  the  tuyeres  at  a  pressure  of  3  to  5  pounds  per  square  inch  gauge  (20  to 
35  kilopascals),  simultaneously  fluidizes  the  bed  of  hot  sand  and  the  incoming  sludge. 
Temperatures  of  1,400  to  1,700°F  (750  to  925 °C)  are  maintained  in  the  bed.  As  the  sludge 
bums,  fine  ash  particles  are  carried  out  the  top  of  the  furnace.  Some  sand  is  also  removed  in 
the  air  stream  and  must  be  replaced  at  regular  intervals. 


Combustion  of  the  sludge  occurs  in  two  zones.  Within  the  sand  bed  itself  (the 
fust  zone),  evaporation  of  the  water  and  pyrolysis  of  the  organic  materials  occur  nearly 
simultaneously  as  the  temperature  of  the  sludge  is  rapidly  raised  In  the  freeboard  area  (the 
second  zone),  the  remaining  free  carbon  and  combustible  gases  are  burned.  The  second  zone 
functions  essentially  as  an  afterburner. 

Fluidization  achieves  nearly  ideal  mixing  between  the  sludge  and  the  combustion 
air,  and  the  turbulence  facilitates  the  transfer  of  heat  from  the  hot  sand  to  the  sludge.  The 

most  noticeable  impact  of  the  better  burning  atmosphere  provided  by  an  FBC  is  seen  in  the 
limited  amount  of  excess  air  required  for  complete  combustion  of  the  sludge.  Typically,  FBCs 
can  achieve  complete  combustion  with  20  to  50  percent  excess  air,  about  half  the  excess  air 
required  by  MHFs.  As  a  consequence,  FBCs  generally  have  lower  fuel  requirements 
compared  to  MHFs. 


Electric  Infrared  Incinerators 


Electric  infrared  incinerators  consist  of  a  horizontally  oriented,  insulated 

furnace.  A  woven  wire  belt  conveyor  extends  the  length  of  the  furnace  and  infrared  heating 


7-15 


elements  are  located  in  the  roof  above  the  conveyor  belt.  Combustion  air  is  preheated  by  the 
flue  gases  and  is  injected  into  the  discharge  end  of  the  furnace.  Electric  infrared  incinerators 
consist  of  a  number  of  prefabricated  modules  that  can  be  linked  together  to  provide  the 
necessary  furnace  length.  A  cross-section  of  an  electric  furnace  is  shown  in  Figure  7-5. 198 

The  dewatered  sludge  cake  is  conveyed  into  one  end  of  the  incinerator.  An 
internal  roller  mechanism  levels  the  sludge  into  a  continuous  layer  approximately  1  inch  thick 
across  the  width  of  the  belt.  The  sludge  is  sequentially  dried  and  then  burned  as  it  moves 
beneath  the  infrared  heating  elements.  Ash  is  discharged  into  a  hopper  at  the  opposite  end  of 
the  furnace.  The  preheated  combustion  air  enters  the  furnace  above  the  ash  hopper  and  is 
further  heated  by  the  outgoing  ash.  The  direction  of  air  flow  is  countercurrent  to  the 
movement  of  the  sludge  along  the  conveyor.  Exhaust  gases  leave  the  furnace  at  the  feed  end. 
Excess  air  rates  vary  from  20  to  70  percent. 

Other  Technologies 

A  number  of  other  technologies  have  been  used  for  incineration  of  sewage 
sludge,  including  cyclonic  reactors,  rotary  kilns,  and  wet  oxidation  reactors.  These  processes 
are  not  in  widespread  use  in  the  United  States  and  are  discussed  only  briefly. 

The  cyclonic  reactor  is  designed  for  small-capacity  applications  and  consists  of  a 
vertical  cylindrical  chamber  that  is  lined  with  refractory.  Preheated  combustion  air  is 
introduced  into  the  chamber  tangentially  at  high  velocities.  The  sludge  is  sprayed  radially 
toward  the  hot  refractory  walls.  Combustion  is  rapid,  such  that  the  residence  time  of  the 
sludge  in  the  chamber  is  on  the  order  of  10  seconds.  The  ash  is  removed  with  the  flue  gases. 

Rotary  kilns  are  also  generally  used  for  small  capacity  applications.  The  kiln  is 
inclined  slightly  from  the  horizontal  plane,  with  the  upper  end  receiving  both  the  sludge  feed 
and  the  combustion  air.  A  burner  is  located  at  the  lower  end  of  the  kiln.  The  circumference  of

the  kiln  rotates  at  a  speed  of  about  6  inches  per  second.  Ash  is  deposited  into  a  hopper  located 
below  the  burner. 

The  wet  oxidation  process  is  not  strictly  one  of  incineration;  it  instead  utilizes 
oxidation  at  elevated  temperature  and  pressure  in  the  presence  of  water  (flameless  combustion). 
Thickened  sludge,  at  about  6-percent  solids,  is  first  ground  and  mixed  with  a  stoichiometric 
amount  of  compressed  air.  The  sludge/air  mixture  is  then  circulated  through  a  series  of  heat 
exchangers  before  entering  a  pressurized  reactor.  The  temperature  of  the  reactor  is  held 
between  350  and  600°F  (175  and  315°C).  The  pressure  is  normally  1,000  to  1,800  pounds 
per  square  inch  grade  (7,000  to  12,500  kilopascals).  Steam  is  usually  used  for  auxiliary  heat. 
The  water  and  resulting  ash  are  circulated  out  the  reactor  and  are  separated  in  a  tank  or  lagoon. 
The  liquid  phase  is  recycled  to  the  treatment  plant.  Off-gases  must  be  treated  to  eliminate 
odors. 

Co-Incineration  and  Co-Firing 

Wastewater  treatment  plant  sludge  generally  has  a  high  water  content  and,  in 
some  cases,  fairly  high  levels  of  inert  materials.  As  a  result,  the  net  fuel  value  of  sludge  is 
often  low.  If  sludge  is  combined  with  other  combustible  materials  in  a  co-incineration  scheme, 
a  furnace  feed  can  be  created  that  has  both  a  low  water  concentration  and  a  heat  value  high 
enough  to  sustain  combustion  with  little  or  no  supplemental  fuel.  Virtually  any  material  that 
can  be  burned  can  be  combined  with  sludge  in  a  co-incineration  process.  Common  materials 
for  co-incineration  are  coal,  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW),  wood  waste,  and  agricultural 
waste. 


There  are  two  basic  approaches  to  combusting  sludge  with  MSW:  (1)  use  of 
MSW  combustion  technology  by  adding  dewatered  or  dried  sludge  to  the  MSW  combustion 
unit,  and  (2)  use  of  sludge  combustion  technology  by  adding  processed  MSW  as  a 
supplemental  fuel  to  the  sludge  furnace.  With  the  latter,  MSW  is  processed  by  removing 
noncombustibles,  shredding,  air  classifying,  and  screening.  Waste  that  is  more  finely 


7-18 


processed  is  less  likely  to  cause  problems  such  as  severe  erosion  of  the  hearths,  poor 
temperature  control,  and  refractory  failures. 


7,2.2 


Benzene  Emissions  from  Sewage  Sludge  Incineration 


Emission  factors  associated  with  MHFs  and  FBCs  are  provided  in  Table  7-2. 197 
This  table  provides  a  comparison  of  benzene  emissions  based  on  no  control  and  control  with 
various  PM  control  devices  and  an  afterburner.  However,  these  emission  factors  do  not  reflect 
the  effect  of  increased  operating  temperature  on  reducing  benzene  emissions.  As  discussed  in 
Section  7.2.3,  increasing  the  combustion  temperature  facilitates  more  complete  combustion  of 
organics,  resulting  in  lower  benzene  emissions.  It  was  not  possible  in  this  study  to  compare 
the  combustor  operating  conditions  of  all  SSIs  for  which  emissions  test  data  were  available  to 
develop  the  emission  factors  in  Table  7-2. 197  As  a  result,  it  was  not  possible  to  reflect  the 
effect  of  combustion  temperature  on  benzene  emissions.  The  emission  factors  for  MHFs

arc  based  on  test  data  of  combustors  operated  at  a  variety  of  combustion 


temperatures  in  the  primary  combustion  hearths  (1,100  to  1,700°F  [600  to  930°C]). 


Using  emissions  test  data  for  one  sewage  sludge  combustion  facility,  it  was 
possible  to  demonstrate  the  benzene  emission  reduction  achieved  with  the  practice  of  increasing 
operating  temperature  versus  utilizing  an  afterburner  or  a  scrubber.  This  comparison  is 
provided  m  Table  7-3. 199  The  emissions  test  data  for  the  one  facility  used  to  develop  the 
emission  factors  presented  in  Table  7-3  are  also  averaged  into  the  emission  factors  presented  in 
Table  7-2. 


7.2.3  Control  Technologies  for  Sewage  Sludge  Incinerators197-198 

Control  of  benzene  emissions  from  SSIs  is  achieved  primarily  by  promoting 
complete  combustion  by  following  GCP.  The  general  conditions  of  GCP  are  summarized  in 
Section  7.1.3.  As  with  MWIs,  failure  to  achieve  complete  combustion  of  organic  materials 
evolved  from  the  waste  can  result  in  emissions  of  a  variety  of  organic  compounds,  including

benzene,  and  adequate  oxygen,  temperature,  residence  time,  and  turbulence  will  generally 
minimize  emissions  of  most  organics. 

Many  SSIs  have  greater  variability  in  their  organic  emissions  than  do  other 
waste  incinerators  because,  on  average,  sewage  sludge  has  a  high  moisture  content  and  the 
moisture  content  can  vary  widely  during  operation.200 

Additional  reductions  in  benzene  emissions  may  be  achieved  by  utilizing  PM 
control  devices;  however,  it  is  not  always  the  case  that  a  PM  control  device  will  reduce 
benzene  emissions.  In  some  cases,  the  incinerator  operating  conditions  (e.g.,  combustion 
temperature  and  temperature  at  the  air  pollution  control  device)  may  affect  the  performance  of 
scrubbers.199  The  types  of  existing  SSI  PM  controls  range  from  low-pressure-drop  spray 
towers  and  wet  cyclones  to  higher-pressure-drop  venturi  scrubbers  and  venturi/impingement 
tray  scrubber  combinations.  A  few  ESPs  and  baghouses  are  employed,  primarily  where  sludge 
is  co-iired  wiui  MSW. 

The  most  widely  used  PM  control  device  applied  to  an  MHF  is  the  impingement 
tray  scrubber.  Older  units  use  the  tray  scrubber  alone  and  combination  venturi/ impingement 
tray  scrubbers  are  widely  applied  to  newer  MHFs  and  some  FBCs.  Most  electric  incinerators 
and  some  FBCs  use  venturi  scrubbers  only.  As  indicated  in  Table  7-3,  venturi/impingement 
tray  scrubbers  have  been  demonstrated  to  reduce  benzene  emissions  from  SSIs. 

A  schematic  diagram  of  a  typical  combination  venturi/impingement  tray 
scrubber  is  presented  in  Figure  7-6. 198  Hot  gas  exits  the  incinerator  and  enters  the  precooling 
or  quench  section  of  the  scrubber.  Spray  nozzles  in  the  quench  section  cool  the  incoming  gas, 
and  the  quenched  gas  then  enters  the  venturi  section  of  the  control  device. 

Venturi  water  is  usually  pumped  into  an  inlet  weir  above  the  quencher.  The 
venturi  water  enters  the  scrubber  above  the  throat,  completely  flooding  the  throat.  Turbulence 
created  by  high  gas  velocity  in  the  converging  throat  section  deflects  some  of  the  water

traveling  down  the  throat  into  the  gas  stream.  PM  carried  along  with  the  gas  stream  impacts 
on  these  water  particles  and  on  the  water  wall.  As  the  scrubber  water  and  flue  gas  leave  the 
venturi  section,  they  pass  into  the  flooded  elbow,  where  the  stream  velocity  decreases, 
allowing  the  water  and  gas  to  separate.  By  restricting  the  throat  area  within  the  venturi,  the 
linear  gas  velocity  is  increased  and  the  pressure  drop  is  subsequently  increased,  increasing  PM 
removal  efficiency. 

At  the  base  of  the  flooded  elbow,  the  gas  stream  passes  through  a  connecting 
duct  to  the  base  of  the  impingement  tray  tower.  Gas  velocity  is  further  reduced  upon  entry  to 
the  tower  as  the  gas  stream  passes  upward  through  the  perforated  impingement  trays.  Water 
usually  enters  the  trays  from  inlet  ports  on  opposite  sides  and  flows  across  the  tray.  As  gas 
passes  through  each  perforation  in  the  tray,  it  creates  a  jet  that  bubbles  up  the  water  and  further 
entrains  solid  particles.  At  the  top  of  the  tower  is  a  mist  eliminator  to  reduce  the  carryover  of 
water  droplets  in  the  stack  effluent  gas.  The  impingement  section  can  contain  from  one  to  four 
trays. 

In  the  case  of  MHFs,  afterburners  may  be  utilized  to  achieve  additional 
reduction  of  organic  emissions,  including  benzene.  MHFs  produce  more  benzene  emissions 
because  they  are  designed  with  countercurrent  air  flow.  Because  sludge  is  usually  fed  into  the 
top  of  the  furnace,  hot  air  and  wet  sludge  feed  are  contacted  at  the  top  of  the  furnace,  such  that 
any  compounds  distilled  from  the  solids  are  immediately  vented  from  the  furnace  at 
temperatures  too  low  to  completely  destroy  them. 

Utilization  of  an  afterburner  provides  a  second  opportunity  for  these  unbumed 
hydrocarbons  to  be  fully  combusted.  In  afterburning,  furnace  exhaust  gases  are  ducted  to  a 
chamber,  where  they  are  mixed  with  supplemental  fuel  and  air  and  completely  combusted. 
Additionally,  some  incinerators  have  the  flexibility  to  allow  sludge  to  be  fed  to  a  lower  hearth, 
thus  allowing  the  upper  hearth(s)  to  function  essentially  as  an  afterburner.

7.2.4 


Regulatory  Analysis 


Prior  to  1993,  organic  emissions  from  SSIs  were  not  regulated.  On 
February  19,  1993,  Part  503  was  added  to  Subchapter  O  in  Chapter  I  of  Title  40  of  the  CFR, 
establishing  standards  for  use  or  disposal  of  sewage  sludge.  Subpart  E  of  Part  503  regulates 
emissions  of  total  hydrocarbons  (THC)  from  the  incineration  of  SSIs  and  applies  to  all  SSIs. 
The  THC  limit  of  100  ppm  (measured  as  a  monthly  average)  is  a  surrogate  for  all  organic 
compounds,  including  benzene.  In  establishing  a  standard  for  organic  emissions,  EPA  had 
considered  establishing  a  standard  for  14  individual  organic  compounds,  including  benzene; 
however,  it  was  concluded  that  the  individual  organic  pollutants  were  not  significant  enough  a 
factor  in  sewage  sludge  to  warrant  requiring  individual  pollutant  limits.  Furthermore,  based 
on  a  long-term  demonstration  of  heated  flame  ionization  detection  systems  monitoring  organic 
emissions  from  SSIs,  it  was  concluded  that  there  is  an  excellent  correlation  between  THC 
emission  levels  and  organic  pollutant  emission  levels. 

The  THC  limit  established  in  Part  503  is  an  operational  standard  that  would,  in 
general,  not  require  the  addition  of  control  devices  to  existing  incinerators,  but  would  require 
incinerators  to  adopt  good  operating  practices  on  a  continuous  basis.  It  is  expected  that  FBCs 
and  MHFs  will  have  no  difficulty  meeting  the  standard.200  To  ensure  the  adoption  of  GCP,  the 
standard  requires  continuous  THC  monitoring  using  a  flame  ionization  detection  system, 
continuous  monitoring  of  the  moisture  content  in  the  exit  gas,  and  continuous  monitoring  of 
combustion  temperature. 

7.3  HAZARDOUS  WASTE  INCINERATION 

Hazardous  waste  is  produced  in  the  form  of  liquids  (e.g.,  waste  oils, 
halogenated  and  nonhalogenated  solvents,  other  organic  liquids,  and  pesticides/  herbicides) 
and  sludges  and  solids  (e.g.,  halogenated  and  nonhalogenated  sludges  and  solids,  dye  and  paint 
sludges,  resins,  and  latex).  Based  on  a  1986  study,  total  annual  hazardous  waste  generation  in 
the  United  States  was  approximately  292  million  tons  (265  million  metric  tons).201  Only  a 


7-25 


small  fraction  of  the  waste  ( <  1  percent)  was  incinerated.  The  major  types  of  hazardous  waste 
streams  incinerated  were  spent  nonhalogenated  solvents  and  corrosive  and  reactive  wastes 
contaminated  with  organics.  Together,  these  accounted  for  44  percent  of  the  waste 
incinerated.  Other  prominent  wastes  included  hydrocyanic  acid,  acrylonitrile  bottoms,  and 
nonlisted  ignitable  wastes. 

Hazardous  waste  can  be  thermally  destroyed  through  burning  under  oxidative 
conditions  in  incineration  systems  designed  specifically  for  this  purpose  and  in  various  types  of 
industrial  kilns,  boilers,  and  furnaces.  The  primary  purpose  of  a  hazardous  waste  incinerator 
is  the  destruction  of  the  waste;  some  systems  include  energy  recovery  devices.  An  estimated 
1.9  million  tons  (1.7  million  Mg)  of  hazardous  waste  were  disposed  of  in  incinerators  in 
1981. 201  The  primary  purpose  of  industrial  kilns,  boilers,  or  furnaces  is  to  produce  a 
commercially  viable  product  such  as  cement,  lime,  or  steam.  An  estimated  230  million  gallons 
of  waste  fuel  and  waste  oil  were  treated  at  industrial  kilns,  boilers,  and  furnaces  in  1983. 201  In 
1981 .  it  was  estimated  that  industrial  kilns,  boilers,  and  furnaces  disposed  of  more  than  twice 
the  amount  of  waste  that  was  disposed  of  via  incinerators.201 

7.3.1  Process  Description:  Incineration 

Incineration  is  a  process  that  employs  thermal  decomposition  via  thermal 
oxidation  at  high  temperatures  (usually  1,650°F  [900°C]  or  greater)  to  destroy  the  organic 
fraction  of  the  waste  and  reduce  volume.  A  study  conducted  in  1986  identified  221  hazardous 
waste  incinerators  operating  under  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  (RCRA) 
system  in  the  United  States.  (See  Section  7.3.5  for  a  discussion  of  this  and  other  regulations 
applicable  to  hazardous  waste  incineration.)  These  incinerators  are  located  at  189  separate 
facilities,  171  of  which  are  located  at  the  site  of  waste  generation.201 

A  diagram  of  the  typical  process  component  options  in  a  hazardous  waste 
incineration  facility  is  provided  in  Figure  7-7. 201  The  diagram  shows  that  the  major  subsystems 
that  may  be  incorporated  into  the  hazardous  waste  incineration  system  are  (1)  waste

preparation  and  feeding,  (2)  combustion  chamber(s),  (3)  air  pollution  control,  and  (4) 
residue/ash  handling.  These  subsystems  are  discussed  in  this  section,  except  that  air  pollution 
control  devices  are  discussed  in  Section  7.3.4  of  this  section. 

Additionally,  energy-recovery  equipment  may  be  installed  as  part  of  the 
hazardous  waste  incineration  system,  provided  that  the  incinerator  is  large  enough  to  make 
energy  recovery  economically  productive  (i.e.,  bigger  than  about  7  million  Btu/hour 
[7.4  million  kJ/hourl)  and  that  corrosive  constituents  (e.g.,  HC1)  and  adhesive  particulates  are 
not  present  at  levels  that  would  damage  the  equipment.202 

Additionally,  a  few  other  technologies  have  been  used  for  incineration  of 
hazardous  waste,  including  ocean  incineration  vessels  and  mobile  incinerators.  These 
processes  are  not  in  widespread  use  in  the  United  States  and  are  discussed  only  briefly. 

Waste  Preparation  and  Feeding^* 

The  feed  method  is  determined  by  the  physical  form  of  the  hazardous  waste. 
Waste  liquids  are  blended  and  then  pumped  into  the  combustion  chamber  through  nozzles  or 
via  atomizing  burners.  Liquid  wastes  containing  suspended  panicles  may  need  to  be  screened 
to  avoid  clogging  of  small  nozzle  or  atomizer  openings.  Liquid  wastes  may  also  be  blended  in 
order  to  control  the  heat  content  of  the  liquid  to  achieve  sustained  combustion  (typically  to 
8,000  Btu/lb  [18,603  kJ/kg])  and  to  control  the  chlorine  (CL)  content  of  the  waste  fed  to  the 
incinerator  (typically  to  30  percent  or  less)  to  limit  the  potential  for  formation  of 
hazardous-free  Cl2  gas  in  the  combustion  gas. 

Waste  sludges  are  typically  fed  to  the  combustion  chamber  using  progressive 
cavity  pumps  and  water-cooled  lances.  Bulk  solid  wastes  may  be  shredded  to  control  particle 
size  and  may  be  fed  to  the  combustion  chamber  via  rams,  gravity  feed,  air  lock  feeders, 
vibratory  or  screw  feeders,  or  belt  feeders. 


7-28 


Combustion  Chambers201,202 


today:202 


The  following  five  types  of  combustion  chambers  are  available  and  operating 


•  Liquid  injection; 

•  Rotary  kiln; 

•  Fixed-hearth: 

•  Fluidized-bed;  and 

•  Fume. 

These  five  types  of  combustion  chambers  are  discussed  below. 

Liquid  iniection--Liquid  injection  combustion  chambers  are  applicable  almost 
exclusively  for  pumpable  liquid  waste,  including  some  low-viscosity  sludges  and  slurries.  The 
typical  capacity  of  liquid  injection  units  is  about  8  to  28  million  Btu/hour  (8.4  to  29.5  million 
kJ/hr).  Figure  7-8  presents  a  typical  schematic  diagram  of  a  liquid-injection  unit.201 

Liquid  injection  units  are  usually  simple,  refractory-lined  cylinders  (either 
horizontally  or  vertically  aligned)  equipped  with  one  or  more  waste  burners.  Vertically 
aligned  units  are  preferred  when  wastes  are  high  in  organic  salts  and  fusable  ash  content; 
horizontal  units  may  be  used  with  low-ash  waste.  Liquid  wastes  are  injected  through  the 
bumer(s),  atomized  to  fme  droplets,  and  burned  in  suspension.  Burners  and  separate  waste 
injection  nozzles  may  be  oriented  for  axial,  radial,  or  tangential  firing.  Good  atomization, 
using  gas-fluid  nozzles  with  high-pressure  air  or  steam  or  with  mechanical  (hydraulic)  means, 
is  necessary  to  achieve  high  liquid  waste  destruction  efficiency. 

Rotary  Kiln--Rotarv  kiln  incinerators  are  applicable  to  the  destruction  of  solid 
wastes,  slurries,  containerized  waste,  and  liquids.  Because  of  their  versatility,  they  are  most

frequently  used  by  commercial  off-site  incineration  facilities.  The  typical  capacity  of  these 
units  is  about  10  to  60  million  Btu/hour.  Figure  7-9  presents  a  typical  schematic  diagram  of  a 
rotary  kiln  unit.201 

Rotary  kiln  incinerators  generally  consist  of  two  combustion  chambers:  a 
rotating  kiln  and  an  afterburner.  The  rotary  kiln  is  a  cylindrical  refractory-lined  shell  that  is 
mounted  on  a  slight  incline.  The  incline  facilitates  ash  and  slag  removal.  Rotation  of  the  shell 
provides  transportation  of  the  waste  through  the  kiln  and  enhances  mixing  of  the  waste  with 
combustion  air.  The  rotational  speed  of  the  kiln  is  used  to  control  waste  residence  time  and 
mixing.  The  primary  function  of  the  kiln  is  to  convert  solid  wastes  to  gases,  which  occurs 
through  a  series  of  volatilization,  destructive  distillation,  and  partial  combustion  reactions. 

An  afterburner  is  connected  directly  to  the  discharge  end  of  the  kiln.  The 
afterburner  is  used  to  ensure  complete  combustion  of  flue  gases  before  their  treatment,  for  air 
pollutants.  A  ternary  combustion  chamber  may  be  added  if  needed.  The  afterburner  itself 
may  be  horizontally  or  vertically  aligned,  and  functions  much  on  the  same  principles  as  the 
liquid  injection  unit  described  above.  Both  the  afterburner  and  the  kiln  are  usually  equipped 
with  an  auxiliary  fuel-firing  system  to  control  the  operating  temperature. 

Fixed-Hearth--Fixed-hearth  incinerators,  also  called  controlled-air,  starved-air, 
or  pyrolytic  incinerators,  are  the  third  major  technology  used  for  hazardous  waste  incineration. 
This  type  of  incinerator  may  be  used  for  the  destruction  of  solid,  sludge,  and  liquid  wastes. 
Fixed-hearth  units  tend  to  be  of  smaller  capacity  (typically  5  million  Btu/hr  [5.3  million  kJ/hr]) 
than  liquid  injection  or  rotary  kiln  incinerators  because  of  physical  limitations  in  ram-feeding 
and  transporting  large  amounts  of  waste  materials  through  the  combustion  chamber.  Lower 
relative  capital  costs  and  reduced  particulate  control  requirements  make  fixed-hearth  units  more 
attractive  than  rotary  kilns  for  smaller  on-site  installations.  Figure  7-10  presents  a  typical 
schematic  diagram  of  a  fixed-hearth  unit.201

Fixed-hearth  units  consist  of  a  two-stage  combustion  process  similar  to  that  of 
rotary  kilns.  Waste  is  ram-fed  into  the  primary  chamber  and  burned  at  about  50  to  80  percent 
of  stoichiometric  air  requirements.  This  starved-air  condition  causes  most  of  the  volatile 
fraction  to  be  destroyed  pyrolitically.  The  resultant  smoke  and  pyrolytic  products  pass  to  the 
secondary  chamber,  where  additional  air  and,  in  some  cases,  supplemental  fuel,  are  injected  to 
complete  the  combustion. 

Fluidized-Bed— FBCs  have  only  more  recently  been  applied  to  hazardous  waste 
incineration.  FBCs  may  be  applied  to  solids,  liquids,  and  gases;  however,  this  type  of 
incinerator  is  most  effective  for  processing  heavy  sludges  and  slurries.  Solids  generally 
require  prescreening  or  crushing  to  a  size  less  than  2  inches  in  diameter.  The  typical  capacity 
of  this  type  of  incinerator  is  45  million  Btu/hr  (47.5  million  kJ/hr).  See  Figure  7-4  of  this 
chapter  for  a  typical  schematic  diagram  of  an  FBC  chamber. 

FBC  chambers  consist  of  a  single  refractory-lined  combustion  vessel  partially 

filled  with  inert  granular  material  (e.g.,  particles  of  sand,  alumina,  and  sodium  carbonate). 
Combustion  air  is  supplied  through  a  distributor  plate  at  the  base  of  the  combustor  at  a  rate 
sufficient  to  fluidize  (bubbling  bed)  or  entrain  (circulating  bed)  the  bed  material.  The  bed  is 
preheated  to  startup  temperatures  by  a  burner.  The  bed  material  is  kept  at  temperatures 
ranging  from  840  to  1,560°F  (450  to  850 °C).  Wastes  are  injected  into  the  combustion 
chamber  pneumatically,  mechanically,  or  by  gravity.  Solid  wastes  are  fed  into  the  combustion 
chamber  through  an  opening  above  the  fluidized  bed  (similar  to  the  opening  for  sand  feed, 
represented  in  Figure  7-4).  Liquid  wastes  are  fed  into  the  bottom  of  the  fluidized  bed 
(represented  in  Figure  7-4  as  the  opening  designated  for  sludge  feed).  As  the  waste  is  fed  to 
the  combustion  chamber,  heat  is  transferred  from  the  bed  material  to  the  wastes.  Upon 
combustion,  the  waste  returns  heat  to  the  bed.  The  high  temperature  of  the  bed  also  allows  for 
combustion  of  waste  gases  above  the  bed. 

Fume-Fume  incinerators  are  used  exclusively  to  destroy  gaseous  or  fume 
wastes.  The  combustion  chamber  is  comparable  to  that  of  a  liquid- injection  incinerator 


7-34 


(Figure  7-8)  in  that  it  usually  has  a  single  chamber,  is  vertically  or  horizontally  aligned,  and 
uses  nozzles  to  inject  the  waste  into  the  chamber  for  combustion.  Waste  gases  are  injected  by 
pressure  or  atomization  through  the  burner  nozzles.  Wastes  may  be  combusted  solely  by 
thermal  or  catalytic  oxidation.  If  no  catalyst  is  used,  the  combustion  chamber  temperature  is 
maintained  at  1,200  to  1,800°F  (650  to  980°C).  If  a  catalyst  is  used  (e.g.,  alumina  coated 
with  noble  metals,  such  as  platinum  or  palladium,  and  other  metals,  such  as  copper  chromate 
or  manganese),  the  temperature  may  be  maintained  at  lower  temperatures  of  500  to  900 °F 
(260  to  480  °C). 

Residue  and  Ash  Handling201 

Residue  and  ash  consist  of  the  inorganic  components  of  the  hazardous  waste  that 
are  not  destroyed  by  incineration.  Bottom  ash  is  created  in  the  combustion  chamber  and 
residue  collects  in  the  air  pollution  control  devices.  After  discharge  from  the  combustion 
chamber  bottom  commonly  air-cooled  or  quenched  with  water.  The  ash  is  then 
accumulated  on  site  in  storage  lagoons  or  in  drums  prior  to  disposal  to  a  permitted  hazardous 
waste  land  disposal  facility.  The  ash  may  also  be  dewatered  or  chemically  fixated/stabilized 
prior  to  disposal. 

Air  pollution  control  residues  are  typically  aqueous  streams  containing  PM, 
absorbed  acid  gases,  and  small  amounts  of  organic  material.  These  streams  are  collected  m 
sumps  or  recirculation  tanks,  where  the  acids  are  neutralized  with  caustic  and  returned  to  the 
process.  When  the  total  dissolved  solids  in  the  aqueous  stream  exceeds  3  percent,  a  portion  of 
the  wastes  is  discharged  for  treatment  and  disposal. 

Ocean  Incinerators 

Ocean  incineration  involves  the  thermal  destruction  of  liquid  hazardous  wastes 
at  sea  in  specially  designed  tanker  vessels  outfitted  with  high-temperature  incinerators.  Ocean 
incinerators  are  identical  to  land-based  liquid  injection  incinerators,  except  that  current  ocean 


7-35 


incinerators  are  not  equipped  with  air  pollution  control  systems.  Largely  due  to  public  concern 
over  potential  environmental  effects,  ocean  incineration  of  hazardous  waste  has  not  been  used 
on  a  routine  basis  in  the  United  States.201 

Mobile  Incinerators 

Mobile  incinerators  have  been  developed  for  on-site  cleanup  at  uncontrolled 
hazardous  waste  sites.  Most  of  these  systems  are  scaled-down,  trailer-mounted  versions  of  a 
conventional  rotary  kiln  or  an  FBC,  with  thermal  capacities  ranging  from  10  to  20  million 
Btu/hr  (10.5  to  21.1  million  kJ/hr).  The  performance  of  these  mobile  systems  has  been  shown 
to  be  comparable  to  equivalent  stationary  facilities.  Because  of  their  high  cost,  these  types  of 
systems  are  considered  to  be  cost-effective  only  at  waste  sites  where  large  amounts  of 
contaminated  material  (e.g.,  soil)  would  need  to  be  transported  off  site.201 

7  3.2  Industrial  Kilns  Boilers,  and  Furnaces 


Industrial  kilns,  boilers,  and  furnaces  bum  hazardous  wastes  as  fuel  to  produce 
commercially  viable  products  such  as  cement,  lime,  iron,  asphalt,  or  steam.  These  industrial 
sources  require  large  inputs  of  fuel  to  produce  the  desired  product.  Hazardous  waste,  which  is 
considered  an  economical  alternative  to  fossil  fuels  for  energy  and  heat,  is  utilized  as  a 
supplemental  fuel.  In  the  process  of  producing  energy  and  heat,  the  hazardous  wastes  are 
subjected  to  high  temperature  for  a  sufficient  time  to  destroy  the  hazardous  content  and  the 
bulk  of  the  waste. 

Based  on  a  study  conducted  in  1984,  there  were  over  1,300  facilities  using 
hazardous  waste-derived  fuels  (HWDF)  in  1983,  accounting  for  a  total  of  230  million  gallons 
(871  million  liters)  of  waste  fuel  and  waste  oil  per  year.  Although  the  majority  (69  percent)  of 
HWDF  is  burned  by  only  about  2  percent  of  the  1,300  facilities  (i.e.,  medium-  to  large-size 
industrial  boilers,  cement  and  aggregate  kilns,  and  iron-making  furnaces),  other  industries 
burning  significant  quantities  of  HWDF  included  the  paper  (SIC  26),  petroleum  (SIC  29), 


7-36 


primary  metals  (SIC  33),  and  stone,  clay,  glass,  and  concrete  (SIC  32)  industries.201  Industrial 
boilers  and  furnaces,  iron  foundries,  and  cement  kilns  are  described  in  more  detail  in 
Sections  7.4,  7.7,  and  7.8,  respectively,  of  this  document. 

7.3.3  Benzene  Emissions  From  Hazardous  Waste  Incineration 

There  are  limited  data  documenting  benzene  emissions  from  hazardous  waste 
incinerators.  However,  as  discussed  below,  benzene  is  one  of  the  most  frequently  identified 
products  of  incomplete  combustion  (PICs)  in  air  emissions  from  hazardous  waste 
incinerators.203  Two  emission  factors  for  benzene  emissions  are  provided  in  Table  7-4. 

7.3.4  Control  Technologies  for  Hazardous  Waste  Incineration 

Most  organics  control  is  achieved  by  promoting  complete  combustion  by 
following  GCP  The  general  condition*  of  GCP  are  summarized  in  Section  7.1.3.  Again , 
failure  to  achieve  complete  combustion  of  organic  materials  evolved  from  the  waste  can  result 
in  emissions  of  a  variety  of  organic  compounds.  Benzene  is  one  of  the  most  frequently 
identified  PICs  in  air  emissions  from  hazardous  waste  incinerators.203 

In  addition  to  adequate  oxygen,  temperature,  residence  time,  and  turbulence, 
control  of  organics  may  be  partially  achieved  by  using  acid  gas  and  PM  control  devices; 
however,  this  has  not  been  documented.  The  most  frequently  used  control  devices  for  acid  gas 
and  PM  control  are  wet  scrubbers  and  fabric  filters.  Fabric  filters  provide  mainly  PM  control. 
Other  PM  control  technologies  include  venturi  scrubbers  and  ESPs.  In  addition  to  wet 
scrubbing,  dry  sorbent  injection  and  spray  dryer  absorbers  have  also  been  used  for  acid  gas 
(HC1  and  S02)  control.

Regulatory  Analysis 


Organic  emissions  from  hazardous  waste  incinerators  are  regulated  under 
40  CFR  246,  Subpart  O,  promulgated  on  June  24,  1982. 204  The  standards  require  that  in  order 
for  a  hazardous  waste  incineration  facility  to  receive  a  RCRA  permit,  it  must  attain  a  99.99 
percent  destruction  and  removal  efficiency  (DRE)  for  each  principal  organic  hazardous 
constituent  (POHC)  in  the  waste  feed.  Each  facility  must  determine  which  one  or  more 
organic  compounds,  from  a  list  of  approximately  400  organic  and  inorganic  hazardous 
chemicals  (including  benzene)  in  Appendix  VIII  of  40  CFR  261, 205  are  POHCs,  based  on 
which  are  the  most  difficult  to  incinerate,  considering  their  concentration  or  mass  in  the  waste 
feed.  Each  facility  must  then  conduct  trial  bums  to  determine  the  specific  operating  conditions 
under  which  99.99  percent  DRE  is  achieved  for  each  POHC. 

In  order  to  ensure  99.99  percent  DRE,  operating  limits  are  established  in  a 
permit  for  each  incineratnr  for  the  following  conditions*  (1)  CO  level  in  the  stack  exhaust  gas. 
(2)  waste  feed  rate,  (3)  combustion  temperature,  (4)  an  appropriate  indicator  of  combustion  gas 
velocity,  (5)  allowable  variations  in  incinerator  system  design  or  operating  procedures,  and 
(6)  other  operating  requirements  considered  necessary  to  ensure  99.99  percent  DRE  for  the 
POHCs. 


Additionally,  Subpan  0  of  40  CFR  246  requires  that  hazardous  waste 
incineration  facilities  achieve  99-percent  emissions  reduction  of  HC1  (if  HC1  emissions  are 
greater  than  1.8  kg/hr  [4.0  lb/hr])  and  a  limit  of  180  milligrams  per  dry  standard  cubic  meter 
(0.0787  grains  per  dry  standard  cublic  foot)  for  PM  emissions.  These  emission  limits  would 
require  facilities  to  apply  acid  gas/PM  control  devices.  As  mentioned  in  Section  7.3.4,  acid 
gas/PM  control  devices  may  result  in  panial  control  of  emissions  of  organic  compounds.

EXTERNAL  COMBUSTION  OF  SOLID,  LIQUID,  AND  GASEOUS  FUELS 
IN  STATIONARY  SOURCES  FOR  HEAT  AND  POWER  GENERATION 


The  combustion  of  solid,  liquid,  and  gaseous  fuels  such  as  natural  gas,  oil,  coal, 
and  wood  waste  has  been  shown  to  be  a  minor  source  of  benzene  emissions.  This  section 
addresses  benzene  emissions  from  the  external  combustion  of  these  types  of  fuels  by  stationary 
sources  that  generate  heat  or  power  in  the  utility,  industrial/commercial,  and  residential 
sectors. 

7.4.1  Utility  Sector206 

Fossil  fuel-fired  utility  boilers  comprise  about  72  percent  (or  1,696,000  million 
Btu/hr  [497,000  megawatts  (MW)])  of  the  generating  capacity  of  U.S.  electric  power  plants. 
The  primary  fossil  fuels  burned  in  electric  utility  boilers  are  coal,  natural  gas,  and  oil.  Of 
these  fuels,  coal  is  the  most  widely  used,  accounting  for  60  percent  of  the  U.S.  fossil  fuel 
generating  capacity.  Natural  gas  represents  about  25  percent  and  oil  represents  15  percent  of 
the  U.S.  fossil  fuel  generating  capacity. 

Most  of  the  coal-firing  capability  is  east  of  the  Mississippi  River,  with  the 
significant  remainder  being  in  the  Rocky  Mountain  region.  Natural  gas  is  used  primarily  in  the 
South  Central  States  and  California.  Oil  is  predominantly  used  in  Florida  and  the  Northeast. 
Fuel  economics  and  environmental  regulations  affect  regional  use  patterns.  For  example,  coal 
is  not  used  m  California  because  of  stringent  air  quality  limitations.  Information  on  precise 
utility  plant  locations  can  be  obtained  by  contacting  utility  trade  associations  such  as  the 
Electric  Power  Research  Institute  in  Palo  Alto,  California  (415-855-2000);  the  Edison  Electric 
Institute  in  Washington,  D.C.  (202-828-7400);  or  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  in 
Washington,  D.C.  Publications  by  EP A/DOE  on  the  utility  industry  are  also  useful  in 
determining  specific  facility  locations,  sizes,  and  fuel  use.

Process  Description  of  Utility  Boilers 


A  utility  boiler  consists  of  several  major  subassemblies,  as  shown  in 
Figure  7-1  1. 206  These  subassemblies  include  the  fuel  preparation  system,  the  air  supply 
system,  burners,  the  furnace,  and  the  convective  heat  transfer  system.  The  fuel  preparation 
system,  air  supply,  and  burners  are  primarily  involved  in  converting  fuel  into  thermal  energy 
in  the  form  of  hot  combustion  gases.  The  last  two  subassemblies  are  involved  in  the  transfer 
of  the  thermal  energy  in  the  combustion  gases  to  the  superheated  steam  required  to  operate  the 
steam  turbine  and  produce  electricity.206 

Three  key  thermal  processes  occur  in  the  furnace  and  convective  sections  of  the 
boiler.  First,  thermal  energy  is  released  during  controlled  mixing  and  combustion  of  fuel  and 
oxygen  in  the  burners  and  furnace.  Second,  a  portion  of  the  thermal  energy  formed  by 
combustion  is  adsorbed  as  radiant  energy  by  the  furnace  walls.  The  furnace  walls  are  formed 
oy  multiple,  closely  spaced  tubes  filled  with  high-pressure  water  mat  carry  water  from  the 
bottom  of  the  furnace  to  absorb  radiant  heat  energy  to  the  steam  drum  located  at  the  top  of  the 
boiler.  Third,  the  gases  enter  the  convective  pass  of  the  boiler,  and  the  balance  of  the  energy 
retained  by  the  high-temperature  gases  is  adsorbed  as  convective  energy  by  the  convective  heat 
transfer  system  (superheater,  reheater,  economizer,  and  air  preheater).206 

A  number  of  different  furnace  configurations  are  used  in  utility  boilers, 
including  tangentially  fired,  wall-fired,  cyclone-fired,  stoker-fired,  and  FBC  boilers.  Some  of 
these  furnace  configurations  are  designed  primarily  for  coal  combustion;  others  are  designed 
for  coal,  oil,  or  natural  gas  combustion.  The  types  of  furnaces  most  commonly  used  for  firing 
oil  and  natural  gas  are  the  tangentially  fired  and  wall-fired  boiler  designs.207  One  of  the 
primary  differences  between  furnaces  designed  to  bum  coal  versus  oil  or  gas  is  the  furnace 
size.  Coal  requires  the  largest  furnace,  followed  by  oil,  then  gas.206 

The  average  size  of  boilers  used  in  the  utility  sector  varies  primarily  according 
to  boiler  type.  Cyclone-fired  boilers  are  generally  the  largest,  averaging  about  850  to

1,300  million  Btu/hr  (250  to  380  MW)  generating  capacity.  Tangentially  fired  and  wall-fired 
boiler  designs  firing  coal  average  about  410  to  1,470  million  Btu/hr  (120  to  430  MW);  these 
designs  firing  oil  and  natural  gas  average  about  340  to  920  million  Btu/hr  (100  to  270  MW). 
Stoker-fired  boilers  average  about  34  to  58  million  Btu/hr  (1-0  to  17  MW).207  Additionally, 
unit  sizes  of  FBC  boilers  range  from  85  to  1,360  million  Btu/hr  (25  to  400  MW),  with  the 
largest  FBC  boilers  typically  closer  to  680  million  Btu/hr  (200  MW).206 


Tangentially  Fired  Boiler-The  tangentially-fired  boiler  is  based  on  the  concept 
of  a  single  flame  zone  within  the  furnace.  The  fuel-to-air  mixture  in  a  tangentially  fired  boiler 
projects  from  the  four  comers  of  the  furnace  along  a  line  tangential  to  an  imaginary  cylinder 
located  along  the  furnace  centerline.  When  coal  is  used  as  the  fuel,  the  coal  is  pulverized  in  a 
mill  to  the  consistency  of  talcum  powder  (i.e.,  at  least  70  percent  of  the  panicles  will  pass 
through  a  200-mesh  sieve),  entrained  in  primary  air,  and  fired  in  suspension.208  As  fuel  and  air 
are  fed  to  the  burners,  a  rotating  “fireball”  is  formed  to  control  the  furnace  exit  gas

be  moved  up  and  down  by  tilting  the  fuel-air  nozzle  assembly.  Tangentially  fired  boilers 
commonly  bum  coal  (pulverized).  However,  oil  or  gas  may  also  be  burned.206 


Wall-Fired  Boiler— Wall-fired  boilers  are  characterized  by  multiple  individual 
burners  located  on  a  single  wall  or  on  opposing  walls  of  the  furnace.  Refer  to  Figure  7-12  for 
a  diagram  of  a  single  wall-fired  boiler.206  As  with  tangentially  fired  boilers,  when  coal  is  used 
as  the  fuel,  the  coal  is  pulverized,  entrained  in  primary  air,  and  fired  in  suspension.  In 
contrast  to  tangentially  fired  boilers,  which  produce  a  single  flame  envelope  or  fireball,  each  of 
the  burners  in  a  wall-fired  boiler  has  a  relatively  distinct  flame  zone.  Depending  on  the  design 
and  location  of  the  burners,  wall-fired  boilers  consist  of  various  designs,  including  single-wall, 
opposed-wall,  cell,  vertical,  arch,  and  turbo.  Wall-fired  boilers  may  bum  (pulverized)  coal, 
oil,  or  natural  gas.206

Cvcione-Fired  Boiler--As  shown  in  Figure  7-13,  in  cyclone-fired  boilers,  fuel 
and  air  are  burned  in  horizontal,  cylindrical  chambers,  producing  a  spinning,  high-temperature 
flame.  When  coal  is  used,  the  coal  is  crushed  to  a  4-mesh  size  and  admitted  with  the  primary 
air  in  a  tangential  fashion.  The  finer  coal  particles  are  burned  in  suspension  and  the  coarser 
particles  are  thrown  to  the  walls  by  centrifugal  force.207  Cyclone-fired  boilers  are  almost 
exclusively  coal-fired  and  bum  crushed  rather  than  pulverized  coal.  However,  some  units  are 
also  able  to  fire  oil  and  natural  gas.206 

Fluidized-Bed  Combustion  Boiler-Fluidized-bed  combustion  is  a  newer  boiler 
technology  that  is  not  as  widely  used  as  the  other,  conventional  boiler  types.  In  a  typical  FBC 
boiler,  crushed  coal  in  combination  with  inert  material  (sand,  silica,  alumina,  or  ash)  and/or 
sorbent  (limestone)  are  maintained  in  a  highly  turbulent  suspended  state  by  the  upward  flow  of 
primary  air  from  the  windbox  located  directly  below  the  combustion  floor.  This  fluidized  state 
provides  a  large  amount  of  surface  contact  between  the  air  and  solid  particles,  which  promotes 
uniform  and  efficient  combustion  at  lower  furnace  temperatures-between  1,575  and  1,650°F 
(860  and  900°C)  compared  to  2,500  and  2,800°F  (1,370  and  1,540°C)  for  conventional  coal- 
fired  boilers.  Fluidized  bed  combustion  boilers  have  been  developed  to  operate  at  both 
atmospheric  and  pressurized  conditions.  Refer  to  Figure  7-14  for  a  simplified  diagram  of  an 
atmospheric  FBC.200 

Stoker-Fired  Boiler-Rather  than  firing  coal  in  suspension,  mechanical  stokers 
can  be  used  to  bum  coal  in  fuel  beds.  All  mechanical  stokers  are  designed  to  feed  coal  onto  a 
grate  within  the  furnace.  The  most  common  stoker  type  of  boiler  used  in  the  utility  industry  is 
the  spreader-type  stoker  (refer  to  Figure  7-15  for  a  diagram  of  a  spreader  type  stoker 
fired-boiler).206  Other  stoker  types  are  overfeed  and  underfeed  stokers. 

In  spreader  stokers,  a  flipping  mechanism  throws  crushed  coal  into  the  furnace 
and  onto  a  moving  fuel  bed  (grate).  Combustion  occurs  partly  in  suspension  and  partly  on  the 
grate.208  In  overfeed  stokers,  crushed  coal  is  fed  onto  a  traveling  or  vibrating  grate  from  an 
adjustable  gate  above  and  bums  on  the  fuel  bed  as  it  progresses  through  the  furnace.

Conversely,  in  underfeed  stokers,  crushed  coal  is  forced  upward  onto  the  fuel  bed  from  below 
by  mechanical  rams  or  screw  conveyors.206,208 

Benzene  Emissions  from  Utility  Boilers 

Benzene  emissions  from  utility  boilers  may  depend  on  various  factors,  including 

9 

(1)  type  of  fossil  fuel  burned,  (2)  type  of  boiler  used,  (3)  operating  conditions  of  the  boiler, 
and  (4)  pollution  control  device(s)  used.  As  described  below,  conditions  that  favor  more 
complete  combustion  of  the  fuel  generally  result  in  lower  organic  emissions.  Emission  factors 
for  benzene  emissions  from  utility  boilers  are  presented  in  Table  7-5. 

Table  7-5  presents  three  benzene  emission  factors  for  two  types  of  coal-fired 
boilers  utilizing  three  types  of  PM/S02/N0X  air  pollution  control  systems.  The  data  show  only 
slightly  higher  benzene  emissions  from  a  tangentially  fired  boiler  than  a  cyclone-fired  boiler 
firing  coal,  and  show  that  there  is  no  significant  difference  m  benzene  emissions  from  the 
different  air  pollution  control  device  configurations  represented.209 

Table  7-5  also  presents  two  emission  factors  for  two  types  of  natural  gas-fired 
boilers  utilizing  flue  gas  recirculation.3,209,210  The  data  show  only  slightly  higher  emissions  for 
the  opposed- w-all  boiler  than  for  the  tangentially  fired  boiler.  Additionally,  the  emission  tests 
from  which  the  emission  factors  were  generated  demonstrated  that  changes  in  unit  load  and 

excess  air  level  did  not  significantly  impact  benzene  emissions  from  either  boiler  type.210 

Control  Technologies  for  Utility  Boilers 

Utility  boilers  are  highly  efficient  and  generally  the  best  controlled  of  all 
combustion  sources.  Baghouses,  ESPs,  wet  scrubbers,  and  multicyclones  have  been  applied 
for  PM  control  in  the  utility  sector.  A  combination  of  a  wet  scrubber  and  ESP  are  often  used 
to  control  both  S02  and  PM  emissions.

SCR  =  selective  catalytic  reduction. 


The  above  control  technologies  are  not  intended  to  reduce  benzene  emissions 
from  utility  boilers.  In  general,  emissions  of  organic  pollutants,  including  benzene,  are 
reduced  by  operating  the  furnace  in  such  as  way  as  to  promote  complete  combustion  of  the 
fossil  fuel(s)  combusted  in  the  furnace.  Therefore,  any  combustion  modification  that  increases 
the  combustion  efficiency  will  most  likely  reduce  benzene  emissions.  The  following  conditions 
can  increase  combustion  efficiency:211 

•  Adequate  supply  of  oxygen; 

•  Good  air/fuel  mixing; 

•  Sufficiently  high  combustion  temperature; 

•  Short  combustion  gas  residence  time;  and 

•  Uniform  fuel  load  (i.e.,  consistent  combustion  intensity). 

7  4  2  Industrial 'C nmmereial  Sector 

Industrial  boilers  are  widely  used  in  manufacturing,  processing,  mining,  and 
refining  primarily  to  generate  process  steam,  electricity,  or  space  heat  at  the  facility. 

However,  the  industrial  generation  of  electricity  is  limited,  with  only  10  to  15  percent  of 
industrial  boiler  coal  consumption  and  5  to  10  percent  of  industrial  boiler  gas  and  oil 
consumption  used  for  electricity'  generation.212  The  use  of  industrial  boilers  is  concentrated  in 
four  major  industries:  pulp  and  paper,  primary  metals,  chemicals,  and  minerals.  These 
industries  account  for  82  percent  of  the  total  firing  capacity.213  Commercial  boilers  are  used  by 
commercial  establishments,  medical  institutions,  and  educational  institutions  to  provide  space 
heating. 

In  collecting  survey  data  to  support  its  Industrial  Combustion  Coordinated 
Rulemaking  (ICCR),  the  EPA  compiled  information  on  a  total  of  69,494  combustion  boiler 
units  in  the  industrial  and  commercial  sectors.213  While  this  number  likely  underestimates  the 
total  population  of  boilers  in  the  industrial  and  commercial  sectors  (due  to  unreceived  survey 


7-51 


responses  and  lack  of  information  on  very  small  units)  it  provides  an  indication  of  the  large 
number  of  sources  included  in  this  category. 

Of  the  units  included  in  the  ICCR  survey  database,  approximately  70  percent 
were  classified  in  the  natural  gas  fuel  subcategory,  23  percent  in  the  oil  (distillate  and  residual) 
subcategory,  and  6  percent  in  the  coal  burning  subcategory.  These  fuel  subcategory 
assignments  are  based  on  the  units  burning  only  greater  than  90  percent  of  the  specified  fuel 
for  that  subcategnry  All  other  units  (accounting  for  the  other  1  percent  of  assignments)  are 
assigned  to  a  subcategory  of  “other  fossil  fuel.”213 

Other  fuels  burned  in  industrial  boilers  are  wood  wastes,  liquified  petroleum 
gas,  asphalt,  and  kerosene.  Of  these  fuels,  wood  waste  is  the  only  non-fossil  fuel  discussed 
here  because  benzene  emissions  were  not  characterized  for  combustion  of  the  other  fuels.  The 
burning  of  wood  waste  in  boilers  is  confined  to  those  industries  where  it  is  available  as  a 
byproduct.  It  is  burned  both  to  obtain  heat  energy  and  to  alleviate  possible  solid  waste  disposal 
problems.  Generally,  bark  is  the  major  type  of  waste  burned  in  pulp  mills.  In  the  lumber, 
furniture,  and  plywood  industries,  either  a  mixture  of  wood  and  bark  waste  or  wood  waste 
alone  is  most  frequently  burned.  As  of  1980,  there  were  approximately  1,600  wood-fired 
boilers  operating  in  the  United  States,  with  a  total  capacity  of  over  102,381  million  Btu/hour 
(30,000  MW).214 


Industrial  and  commercial  coal  combustion  sources  are  located  throughout  the 
United  States,  but  tend  to  follow  industry  and  population  trends.  Most  of  the  coal-fired 
industrial  boiler  sources  are  located  in  the  Midwest,  Appalachian,  and  Southeast  regions. 
Industrial  wood-fired  boilers  tend  to  be  located  almost  exclusively  at  pulp  and  paper,  lumber 
products,  and  furniture  industry  facilities.  These  industries  are  concentrated  in  the  Southeast, 
Gulf  Coast,  Appalachian,  and  Pacific  Northwest  regions.  The  Pacific  Northwest  contains 
many  of  the  boilers  firing  salt-laden  wood  bark. 


7-52 


Trade  associations  such  as  the  American  Boiler  Manufacturers  Association  in 
Arlington,  Virginia,  (703-522-7350)  and  the  Council  of  Industrial  Boiler  Owners  in  Fairfax 
Station,  Virginia,  (703-250-9042)  can  provide  information  on  industrial  boiler  locations  and 
trends.215 


Process  Description  of  Industrial/Commercial  Boilers 

Some  of  the  same  types  of  boilers  used  by  the  utility  sector  are  also  used  by  the 
industrial/commercial  sector;  however,  the  average  boiler  size  used  by  the 
industrial/commercial  sector  is  substantially  smaller.  Additionally,  a  few  types  of  boiler 
designs  are  used  only  by  the  industrial  sector.  For  a  general  description  of  the  major 
subassemblies  of  boilers  and  their  key  thermal  processes,  refer  to  the  discussion  of  utility 
boilers  in  Section  7.4.1  and  Figure  7-11.  The  following  two  sections  describe 
industrial/commercial  boilers  that  fire  fossil  fuels  and  wood  waste. 

Fossil  Fuel  Combustion--All  of  the  boilers  used  by  the  utility  industry 
(described  in  Section  7.4.1)  are  “water-tube”  boilers,  which  means  that  the  water  being  heated 
flows  through  tubes  and  the  hot  gases  circulate  outside  the  tubes.  Water-tube  boilers  represent 
the  majority  (57  percent)  of  industrial  and  commercial  boiler  capacity  (70  percent  of  industrial 
boiler  capacity).212  Water-tube  boilers  are  used  in  a  variety  of  applications,  ranging  from 
supplying  large  amounts  of  process  steam  to  providing  space  heat  for  industrial  and 
commercial  facilities.  These  boilers  have  capacities  ranging  from  10  to  1,500  million  Btu/hr 
(3  to  440  MW),  averaging  about  410  million  Btu/hr  (120  MW).  The  most  common  types  of 
water-tube  boilers  used  in  the  industrial/  commercial  sector  are  wall-fired  and  stoker-fired 
boilers.  Tangentially  fired  and  FBC  boilers  are  less  commonly  used.  Refer  to  Section  7.4.1 
for  descriptions  of  these  boiler  designs.213 

The  industrial/commercial  sector  also  uses  boilers  with  two  other  types  of  heat 
transfer  methods:  fire-tube  and  cast  iron  boilers.  Because  their  benzene  emissions  have  not 
been  characterized,  these  types  of  boilers  are  only  briefly  described  below. 


7-53 


In  fire-tube  boilers,  the  hot  gas  flows  through  the  tubes  and  the  water  being 
heated  circulates  outside  of  the  tubes.  Fire-tube  boilers  are  not  available  with  capacities  as 
large  as  those  of  water-tube  boilers,  but  they  are  also  used  to  produce  process  steam  and  space 
heat.  Most  fire-tube  boilers  have  a  capacity  between  1.4  and  24.9  million  Btu/hour 
(0.4  and7.3  MW  thermal).  Most  installed  firetube  boilers  bum  oil  or  gas.213 

In  cast  iron  boilers,  the  hot  gas  is  also  contained  inside  the  tubes,  which  are 
surrounded  by  the  water  being  heated,  but  the  units  are  constructed  of  cast  iron  instead  of 
steel.  Cast  iron  boilers  are  limited  in  size  and  are  used  only  to  supply  space  heat.  Cast  iron 
boilers  range  in  size  from  less  than  0.3  to  9.9  million  Btu/hour  (0.1  to  2.9  MW  thermal).213 

Wood  Combustion--The  burning  of  wood  waste  in  boilers  is  mostly  confmed  to 
those  industries  where  it  is  available  as  a  byproduct.  It  is  burned  both  to  obtain  heat  energy 
and  to  alleviate  solid  waste  disposal  problems.  Wood  waste  may  include  large  pieces  such  as 
slabs,  logs  and  bark  strips  as  well  as  cuttings,  shavings,  pellets,  and  sawdust.214 

Various  boiler  firing  configurations  are  used  in  burning  wood  waste.  One 
common  type  in  smaller  operations  is  the  dutch  oven  or  extension  type  of  furnace  with  a  flat 
grate.  This  unit  is  widely  used  because  it  can  bum  fuels  with  very  high  moisture.  Fuel  is  fed 
into  the  oven  through  apertures  in  a  firebox  and  is  fired  in  a  cone-shaped  pile  on  a  flat  grate. 
The  burning  is  done  in  two  stages:  (1)  drying  and  gasification,  and  (2)  combustion  of  gaseous 
products.  The  first  stage  takes  place  in  a  cell  separated  from  the  boiler  section  by  a  bridge 
wall.  The  combustion  stage  takes  place  in  the  main  boiler  section.214 

In  another  type  of  boiler,  the  fuel-cell  oven,  fuel  is  dropped  onto  suspended 
fixed  grates  and  fired  in  a  pile.  The  fuel  cell  uses  combustion  air  preheating  and  positioning  of 
secondary  and  tertiary  air  injection  ports  to  improve  boiler  efficiency.214 

In  many  large  operations,  more  conventional  boilers  have  been  modified  to  bum 

wood  waste.  The  units  may  include  spreader  stokers  with  traveling  grates  or  vibrating  grate 


7-54 


stokers,  as  well  as  tangentially  fired  or  cyclone-fired  boilers  (see  Section  7.4.1  for  descriptions 
of  these  types  of  boilers).  The  most  widely  used  of  these  configurations  is  the  spreader  stoker, 
which  can  bum  dry  or  wet  wood.  Fuel  is  dropped  in  front  of  an  air  jet  that  casts  the  fuel  out 
over  a  moving  grate.  The  burning  is  done  in  three  stages:  (1)  drying,  (2)  distillation  and 
burning  of  volatile  matter,  and  (3)  burning  of  fixed  carbon.  Natural  gas  or  oil  is  often  fired  as 
auxiliary  fuel.  This  is  done  to  maintain  constant  steam  when  the  wood  supply  fluctuates  or  to 
provide  more  steam  than  can  be  generated  from  the  wood  supply  alone.214 

Sander  dust  is  often  burned  in  various  boiler  types  at  plywood,  particle  board, 
and  furniture  plants.  Sander  dust  contains  fine  wood  particles  with  low  moisture  content  (less 
than  20  percent  by  weight).  It  is  fired  in  a  flaming  horizontal  torch,  usually  with  natural  gas  as 

an  ignition  aid  or  supplementary  fuel.214 

A  recent  development  in  wood  firing  is  the  FBC  boiler.  Refer  to  Section  7.4.1 
for  2  description  of  this  boiler  type.  Because  of  the  large  thermal  mass  represented  by  the  hot 
inert  bed  particles,  FBCs  can  handle  fuels  with  high  moisture  content  (up  to  70  percent,  total 
basis).  Fluidized  beds  can  also  handle  dirty  fuels  (up  to  30  percent  inert  material).  Wood 
material  is  pyrolyzed  more  quickly  in  a  fluidized  bed  than  on  a  grate  because  of  its  immediate 
contact  with  hot  bed  material.  Combustion  is  rapid  and  results  in  nearly  complete  combustion 
of  organic  matter,  minimizing  emissions  of  unbumed  organic  compounds.214 

Benzene  Emissions  from  Industrial/Commercial  Boilers 

Benzene  emissions  from  industrial/commercial  boilers  may  depend  on  various 
factors,  including  (1)  type  of  fuel  burned,  (2)  type  of  boiler  used,  (3)  operating  conditions  of 
the  boiler,  and  (4)  pollution  control  device(s)  used.  Conditions  that  favor  more  complete 
combustion  of  the  fuel  generally  result  in  lower  organic  emissions.  Additionally,  the  organic 
emissions  potential  of  wood  combustion  is  generally  thought  to  be  greater  than  that  of  fossil 
fuel  combustion  because  wood  waste  has  a  lower  heating  value,  which  may  decrease 


7-55 


combustion  efficiency.  Emission  factors  for  benzene  emissions  from  industrial  and 
commercial/institutional  boilers  are  presented  in  Table  7-6.3,216"220 

Table  7-6  presents  emission  factors  primarily  for  wood  waste  combustion. 
Additionally  a  few  emission  factors  are  presented  for  fossil  fuel  (residual  oil  and  coke/coal) 
and  process  gas  (landfill  gas  and  POTW  digester  gas)  combustion.  Most  of  the  emission 
factors  represent  emissions  from  a  non-specified  type  of  boiler.  Only  two  boiler  types  are 
specified  (FBC  and  spreader-stoker).  Additionally,  the  benzene  emission  factors  presented  are 
emissions  following  various  types  of  PM  and  S02  emission  control  systems. 

In  most  cases,  Table  7-6  specifies  the  type  of  wood  waste  associated  with  the 

emission  factors  for  wood  combustion  boilers.  The  composition  of  wood  waste  may  have  an 
impact  on  benzene  emissions.  The  composition  of  wood  waste  depends  largely  on  the  industry 
from  which  it  originates.  Pulping  operations,  for  example,  produce  great  quantities  of  bark 
that  may  contain  more  than  70  percent  by  weight  moisture,  along  with  sand  and  other 
noncombustibles.  Because  of  this,  bark  boilers  in  pulp  mills  may  emit  considerable  amounts  of 
organic  compounds  to  the  atmosphere  unless  they  are  well  controlled.  On  the  other  hand, 
some  operations,  such  as  furniture  manufacturing,  produce  a  clean,  dry  wood  waste,  5  to 
50  percent  by  weight  moisture,  with  relatively  low  organic  emissions  when  properly  burned. 
Still  other  operations,  such  as  sawmills,  bum  a  varying  mixture  of  bark  and  wood  waste  that 
results  in  paniculate  emissions  somewhere  between  those  of  pulp  mills  and  furniture 
manufacturing.  Additionally,  when  fossil  fuels  are  co-fired  with  wood  waste,  the  combustion 
efficiency  is  typically  improved;  therefore,  organic  emissions  may  decrease.215 

The  type  of  boiler,  as  well  as  its  operation,  affect  combustion  efficiency  and 
emissions.  Wood-fired  boilers  require  a  sufficiently  large  refractory  surface  to  ensure  proper 
drying  of  high-moisture-content  wood  waste  prior  to  combustion.  Adequately  dried  fuel  is 
necessary  to  avoid  a  decrease  in  combustion  temperatures,  which  may  increase  organic 
emissions  because  of  incomplete  combustion.215

Control  Technologies  for  Industrial/Commercial  Boilers 


Control  techniques  for  reducing  benzene  emissions  from  industrial  and 
commercial  boilers  are  similar  to  those  used  for  utility  boilers.  Refer  to  Section  7.4.1  for  a 
discussion  of  control  techniques  also  applicable  to  commercial  and  industrial  boilers. 

In  Section  7.4.1,  various  operating  conditions  are  listed  that  contribute  to  the 
combustion  efficiency  of  a  boiler  (e.g.,  oxygen  supply,  good  air/fuel  mixing,  and 
temperature).  It  has  been  demonstrated  for  a  spreader-stoker  boiler  firing  wood  that  benzene 
emissions  are  an  order  of  magnitude  lower  under  good  firing  conditions  than  under  poor  firing 
conditions  (when  the  boiler  was  in  an  unsteady  or  upset  condition).  It  has  also  been  shown  that 
the  ratio  of  overfire  to  underfire  air  plays  an  important  role  in  benzene  emissions.  Based  on 
recent  test  results,  the  speculation  is  that  if  the  balance  of  combustion  air  heavily  favors 
underfire  air,  there  is  insufficient  combustion  air  in  the  upper  furnace  to  complete  the 
combustion  of  PTCs  (including  benzene)  Conversely,  with  excess  overfire  air.  the  flame¬ 
quenching  effect  of  too  much  combustion  air  in  the  upper  furnace  appears  to  suppress  the 
combustion  of  PICs  at  that  stage  of  the  combustion  process.218 

7.4.3  Residential  Sector 


The  residential  sector  includes  furnaces  and  boilers  burning  coal,  oil,  and 
natural  gas,  stoves  and  fireplaces  burning  wood,  and  kerosene  heaters.  All  of  these  units  are 
designed  to  heat  individual  homes.  Locations  of  residential  combustion  sources  are  tied 
directly  to  population  trends.  Coal  consumption  for  residential  combustion  purposes  occurs 
mainly  in  the  Northeast,  Appalachian,  and  Midwest  regions.  Residential  oil  consumption  is 
greatest  in  the  Northeast  and  Mid- Atlantic  regions.  Wood-fired  residential  units  are  generally 
concentrated  in  heavily  forested  areas  of  the  United  States,  which  reflects  fuel  selection  based 
on  availability  and  price.215

Process  Description  for  Residential  Furnaces,  Boilers,  Stoves,  and  Fireplaces 

The  following  sections  describe  the  types  of  residential  furnaces,  boilers,  stoves, 
and  fireplaces  that  fire  wood,  coal,  oil,  natural  gas,  kerosene. 

Wood  Combustion— Residential  wood  combustion  generally  occurs  in  either  a 
wood-fired  stove  or  fireplace  unit  located  inside  the  house.  The  following  discussion  describes 
the  specific  characterization  of  woodstoves,  followed  by  a  discussion  on  fireplaces. 

Woodstoves  are  commonly  used  in  residences  as  space  heaters.  They  are  used 
both  as  the  primary  source  of  residential  heat  and  to  supplement  conventional  heating  systems. 
Wood  stoves  have  varying  designs  based  on  the  use  or  non-use  of  baffles  and  catalysts,  the 
extent  of  combustion  chamber  sealing,  and  differences  in  air  intake  and  exhaust  systems. 

The  EPA  has  identified  five  different  categories  of  wood-burning  stoves  based 

on  differences  in  both  the  magnitude  and  the  composition  of  the  emissions:221 

•  Conventional  woodstoves; 

•  Noncatalytic  woodstoves; 

•  Catalytic  woodstoves; 

•  Pellet  stoves;  and 

•  Masonry  heaters. 

Within  these  categories,  there  are  many  variations  in  device  design  and  operation. 

The  conventional  stove  category  comprises  all  stoves  that  do  not  have  catalytic 
combustors  and  are  not  included  in  the  other  noncatalytic  categories  (i.e.,  noncatalytic  and 
pellet).  Conventional  stoves  do  not  have  any  emissions  reduction  technology  or  design 
features  and,  in  most  cases,  were  manufactured  before  July  1,  1986.  Stoves  of  many  different 


7-60 


airflow  designs  may  be  included  in  this  category,  such  as  updraft,  downdraft,  crossdraft  and 
S-flow.221 

Noncatalytic  woodstoves  are  those  units  that  do  not  employ  catalysts  but  do  have 
emissions-reducing  technology  or  features.  Typical  noncatalytic  design  includes  baffles  and 
secondary  combustion  chambers.221 

Catalytic  stoves  are  equipped  with  a  ceramic  or  metal  honeycomb  device,  called 
a  combustor  or  converter,  that  is  coated  with  a  noble  metal  such  as  platinum  or  palladium. 

The  catalyst  material  reduces  the  ignition  temperature  of  the  unbumed  VOC  and  CO  in  the 
exhaust  gases,  thus  augmenting  their  ignition  and  combustion  at  normal  stove  operating 

temperatures.  As  these  components  bum,  the  temperamre  inside  the  catalyst  increases  to  a 
point  at  which  the  ignition  of  the  gases  is  essentially  self-sustaining.221 


Pellet  stoves  axe  those  fueled  with  pellets  of  sawdust,  wood  products,  and  other 

biomass  materials  pressed  into  manageable  shapes  and  sizes.  These  stoves  have  active  air  flow 
systems  and  unique  grate  design  to  accommodate  this  type  of  fuel.  Some  pellet  stove  models 
are  subject  to  the  1988  NSPS;  others  are  exempt  because  of  their  high  air-to-fuel  ratio  (greater 


than  35-to-l). 


121 


Masonry  heaters  are  large,  enclosed  chambers  made  of  masonry  products  or  a 
combination  of  masonry  products  and  ceramic  materials.  These  devices  are  exempt  from  the 
1988  NSPS  because  of  their  weight  (greater  than  800  kg).  Masonry  heaters  are  gaining 
popularity  as  a  cleaner-burning  and  heat-efficient  form  of  primary  and  supplemental  heat, 
relative  to  some  other  types  of  wood  heaters.  In  a  masonry  heater,  a  complete  charge  of  wood 
is  burned  in  a  relatively  short  period  of  time.  The  use  of  masonry  materials  promotes  heat 
transfer.  Thus,  radiant  heat  from  the  heater  warms  the  surrounding  area  for  many  hours  after 
the  fire  has  burned  out.221 


7-61 


Fireplaces  are  used  primarily  for  aesthetic  effects  and  secondarily  as  a 
supplemental  heating  source  in  houses  and  other  dwellings.  Wood  is  the  most  common  fuel  for 
fireplaces,  but  coal  and  densified  wood  “logs”  may  also  be  burned.222  The  user  intermittently 
adds  fuel  to  the  fire  by  hand. 

Fireplaces  can  be  divided  into  two  broad  categories:  (1)  masonry  (generally 
brick  and/or  stone,  assembled  on  site,  and  integral  to  a  structure)  and  (2)  prefabricated  (usually 
metal,  installed  on  site  as  a  package  with  appropriate  duct  work).  Masonry  fireplaces  typically 
have  large,  fixed  openings  to  the  fire  bed  and  dampers  above  the  combustion  area  in  the 
chimney  to  limit  room  air  and  heat  losses  when  the  fireplace  is  not  being  used.  Some  masonry 
fireplaces  are  designed  or  retrofitted  with  doors  and  louvers  to  reduce  the  intake  of  combustion 
air  during  use.222 

Prefabricated  fireplaces  are  commonly  equipped  with  louvers  and  glass  doors  to 
reduce  the  intake  of  combustion  air,  and  some  are  surrounded  by  ducts  through  which 
floor-level  air  is  drawn  by  natural  convection,  heated,  and  returned  to  the  room.  Many 
varieties  of  prefabricated  fireplaces  are  now  on  the  market.  One  general  class  is  the 
freestanding  fireplace,  the  most  common  of  which  consists  of  an  inverted  sheet  metal  funnel 
and  stovepipe  directly  above  the  fire  bed.  Another  class  is  the  “zero  clearance”  fireplace,  an 
iron  or  heavy-gauge  steel  firebox  lined  inside  with  firebrick  and  surrounded  by  multiple  steel 
walls  with  spaces  for  air  circulation.  Some  zero  clearance  fireplaces  can  be  inserted  into 
existing  masonry  fireplace  openings,  and  thus  are  sometimes  called  “insens.”  Some  of  these 
units  are  equipped  with  close-fitting  doors  and  have  operating  and  combustion  characteristics 
similar  to  those  of  woodstoves.222 

Masonry  fireplaces  usually  heat  a  room  by  radiation,  with  a  significant  fraction 
of  the  combustion  heat  lost  in  the  exhaust  gases  and  through  fireplace  walls.  Moreover,  some 
of  the  radiant  heat  entering  the  room  goes  toward  warming  the  air  that  is  pulled  into  the 
residence  to  make  up  for  that  drawn  up  the  chimney.  The  net  effect  is  that  masonry  fireplaces 
are  usually  inefficient  heating  devices.  Indeed,  in  cases  where  combustion  is  poor,  where  the 


7-62 


outside  air  is  cold,  or  where  the  fire  is  allowed  to  smolder  (thus  drawing  air  into  a  residence 
without  producing  appreciable  radiant  heat  energy),  a  net  heat  loss  may  occur  in  a  residence 
using  a  fireplace. 

Fireplace  heating  efficiency  may  be  improved  by  a  number  of  measures  that 
either  reduce  the  excess  air  rate  or  transfer  back  into  the  residence  some  of  the  heat  that  would 
normally  be  lost  in  the  exhaust  gases  or  through  fireplace  walls.  As  noted  above,  such 
measures  are  commonly  incorporated  into  prefabricated  units.  As  a  result,  the  energy 
efficiencies  of  prefabricated  fireplaces  are  slightly  higher  than  those  of  masonry  fireplaces.222 

Coal  Combustion-Coal  is  not  a  widely  used  source  of  fuel  for  residential 
heating  purposes  in  the  United  States.  Only  0.3  percent  of  the  total  coal  consumption  in  1990 
was  for  residential  use.223  However,  combustion  units  burning  coal  may  be  sources  of  benzene 
emissions  and  may  be  important  local  sources  in  areas  that  have  a  large  number  of  residential 
houses  tnat  rely  on  tms  ruei  tor  neatmg. 

There  are  a  wide  variety  of  coal-burning  devices  in  use,  including  boilers, 
furnaces,  coal-burning  stoves,  and  wood-burning  stoves  that  bum  coal.  These  units  may  be 
hand  fed  or  automatic  feed.  Boilers  and  warm-air  furnaces  are  usually  stoker-fed  and  are 
automatically  controlled  by  a  thermostat.  The  stove  units  are  less  sophisticated,  generally  hand 
fed,  and  less  energy-efficient  than  boilers  and  furnaces.  Coal-fired  heating  units  are  operated 
at  low  temperatures  and  do  not  efficiently  combust  fuel.215  Therefore,  the  potential  for 
emissions  of  benzene  exists. 

Distillate  Oil  Combustion-The  most  frequently  used  home  heating  oil  in  the 
United  States  is  No.  2  fuel  oil,  otherwise  referred  to  as  distillate  oil.  Distillate  oil  is  the 
second  most  important  home  heating  fuel  behind  natural  gas.224  The  use  of  distillate  oil-fired 
heating  units  is  concentrated  in  the  Northeast  portion  of  the  United  States.  Connecticut, 

Maine,  Massachusetts,  New  Hampshire,  Rhode  Island,  Vermont,  Delaware,  District  of 


7-63 


Columbia,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  and  Pennsylvania  accounted  for  approximately 
72  percent  of  the  residential  share  of  distillate  oil  sales.225 

Residential  oil-fired  heating  units  exist  in  a  number  of  design  and  operating 
variations  related  to  burner  and  combustion  chamber  design,  excess  air,  heating  medium,  etc. 
Residential  systems  typically  operate  only  in  an  “on”  or  “off’  mode,  with  a  constant  fuel  firing 
rate,  as  opposed  to  commercial  and  industrial  applications,  where  load  modulation  is  used.226 
In  distillate  oil-fired  heating  units,  pressure  or  vaporization  is  used  to  atomize  fuel  oil  in  an 
effort  to  produce  finer  droplets  for  combustion.  Finer  droplets  generally  mean  more  complete 
combustion  and  less  organic  emissions. 

When  properly  tuned,  residential  oil  furnaces  are  relatively  clean  burning, 
especially  as  compared  to  woodstoves.224  However,  another  study  has  shown  that  in  practice 
not  all  of  the  fuel  oil  is  burned  and  tiny  droplets  escape  the  flame  and  are  carried  out  in  the 
exhaust.227  This  study  also  concluded  that  most  of  the  organic  emissions  from  an  oil  furnace 
are  due  to  the  unbumed  oil  (as  opposed  to  soot  from  the  combustion  process),  especially  in  the 
more  modem  burners  that  use  a  retention  head  burner,  where  over  90  percent  of  the  carbon  in 
the  emissions  was  from  unbumed  fuel.227 

Natural  Gas  Combustion-Natural  gas  is  the  fuel  most  widely  used  for  home 
heating  purposes,  with  more  than  half  of  all  the  homes  being  heated  through  natural  gas 
combustion.  Gas-fired  residential  heating  systems  are  generally  less  complex  and  easier  to 
maintain  than  oil-burning  units  because  the  fuel  bums  more  cleanly  and  no  atomization  is 
required.  Most  residential  gas  burners  are  typically  of  the  same  basic  design.  They  use 
natural  aspiration,  where  the  primary  air  is  mixed  with  the  gas  as  it  passes  through  the 
distribution  pipes.  Secondary  air  enters  the  furnace  around  the  burners.  Flue  gases  then  pass 
through  a  heat  exchanger  and  a  stack.  As  with  oil-fired  systems,  there  are  usually  no  pollution 
control  equipment  installed  on  gas  systems,  and  excess  air,  residence  time,  flame  retention 
devices,  and  maintenance  are  the  key  factors  in  the  control  of  emissions  from  these  units. 


7-64 


Kerosene  Combustion— The  sale  and  use  of  kerosene  space  heaters  increased 
dramatically  during  the  1980s  and  they  continue  to  be  sold  and  used  throughout  the  United 
States  as  supplementary  and,  in  some  cases,  as  primary  home  heating  sources.228  These  units 
are  usually  unvented  and  release  emissions  inside  the  home.  There  are  two  basic  types  of 
kerosene  space  heaters:  convective  and  radiant. 

Emission  Factors  for  Residential  Furnaces,  Boilers,  Stoves,  and  Fireplaces 

The  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  or  wood  in  residential  units  is  a  relatively  slow 
and  low-temperature  process.  Studies  do  not  indicate  the  cause(s)  for  benzene  formation  in  the 
residential  sector;  however,  the  mechanism  may  be  similar  to  that  in  industrial  boilers  and 
utility  boilers.  Benzene  may  be  formed  through  incomplete  combustion.  Because  combustion 
in  the  residential  sector  tends  to  be  less  efficient  than  in  other  sectors,  the  potential  to  form 
benzene  may  be  greater. 

Table  7-7  presents  emission  factors  for  uncontrolled  benzene  emissions  from 
both  catalytic  and  non-catalytic  woodstoves.3  Benzene  emission  factors  for  other  types  of 

a 

residential  wood  combustion  sources  are  not  presented  because  of  limited  data. 

In  general,  emissions  of  benzene  can  vary  widely  depending  on  how  the  units 
are  operated  and  the  how  emissions  are  measured.  The  following  factors  may  affect  benzene 

emissions  measured  from  residential  wood  combustion  sources: 

•  Unit  design  and  degree  of  excess  air; 

•  Wood  type,  moisture  content,  and  other  wood  characteristics; 

•  Bum  rate  and  stage  of  bum;  and 

•  Firebox  and  chimney  temperatures.

Control  Techniques  for  Residential  Furnaces,  Boilers,  Stoves,  and  Fireplaces 

Residential  combustion  sources  are  generally  not  equipped  with  PM  or  gaseous 
pollutant  control  devices.  In  coal-  and  wood-fired  sources,  stove  design  and  operating  practice 
changes  have  been  made  to  lower  PM,  hydrocarbon,  and  CO  emissions.  Changes  include 
modified  combustion  air  flow  control,  better  thermal  control  and  heat  storage,  and  the  use  of 
combustion  catalysts.  Such  changes  may  lead  to  reduced  benzene  emissions. 

Woodstove  emissions  reduction  features  include  baffles,  secondary  combustion 
chambers,  and  catalytic  combustors.  Catalytic  combustors  or  convertors  are  similar  to  those 
used  in  automobiles.  Woodstove  control  devices  may  lose  efficiency  over  time.  Control 

degradation  for  any  stoves,  including  noncatalytic  woodstoves,  may  occur  as  a  result  of 
deteriorated  seals  and  gaskets,  misaligned  baffles  and  bypass  mechanisms,  broken  refractories, 
or  other  damaged  functional  components.221  In  addition,  combustion  efficiencies  may  be 

affected  by  differences  in  the  sealing  of  the  chamber  and  control  of  the  intake  and  exhaust 
svstems.215 

7.5  STATIONARY  INTERNAL  COMBUSTION 

Stationary  internal  combustion  (IC)  sources  are  grouped  into  two  categories: 

reciprocating  engines  and  gas  turbines.  Stationary  IC  engines  and  turbines  are  principally  used 
for  electricity  generation  and  industrial  applications  such  as  natural  gas  processing,  and  oil  and 
gas  exploration,  production  and  transmission.229 

7.5.1  Reciprocating  Engines 

Process  Description  for  Reciprocating  Engines 

Reciprocating  engines  may  be  classified  into  two  types:  spark  and  compression 
ignition  (diesel).  However,  all  reciprocating  IC  engines  operate  by  the  same  basic  process 


7-67 


depicted  in  Figure  7- 16. 230  A  combustible  mixture  is  first  compressed  in  a  small  volume 
between  the  head  of  a  piston  and  its  surrounding  cylinder.  -  The  mixture  is  then  ignited  and  the 
resulting  high-pressure  products  of  combustion  push  the  piston  through  the  cylinder.  This 
movement  is  converted  from  linear  to  rotary  motion  by  a  crankshaft.  The  piston  returns, 
pushing  out  exhaust  gases,  and  the  cycle  is  repeated.231 

All  diesel-fueled  engines  are  compression-ignited  and  all  gasoline  and  natural 
gas  fueled  engines  are  spark-ignited;  however,  natural  gas  can  be  used  in  a  compression 
ignition  engine,  as  discussed  below.  The  two  types  of  reciprocating  IC  engines,  spark  ignition 
and  compression  ignition,  are  discussed  below,  according  to  the  following  types  of  fuel: 
distillate  oil  (diesel),  gasoline,  and  natural  gas. 

Distillate  Oil  (DieseP~In  compression  ignition  engines,  more  commonly  known 
as  diesel  engines,  combustion  air  is  first  compression-heated  in  the  cylinder,  and  fuel  is  then 
injected  into  the  hot  air  Ignition  is  spontaneous  because  the  air  is  above  the  auto-ignition 
temperature  of  the  fuel.  All  distillate  oil  reciprocating  engines  are  compression-ignited. 

Diesel  engines  usually  operate  at  a  higher  compression  ratio  (ratio  of  cylinder 
volume  when  the  piston  is  at  the  bottom  of  its  stroke  to  the  volume  when  it  is  at  the  top)  than 
spark-ignited  engines  because  fuel  is  not  present  during  compression;  hence,  there  is  no  danger 
of  premature  auto-ignition.  Because  engine  thermal  efficiency  rises  with  increasing  pressure 
ratio  (and  pressure  ratio  varies  directly  with  compression  ratio),  diesel  engines  are  more 
efficient  than  spark-ignited  engines.  This  increased  efficiency  is  gained  at  the  expense  of 
poorer  response  to  load  changes  and  a  heavier  structure  to  withstand  the  higher  pressures.232 

The  primary  domestic  use  of  large  stationary  diesel  engines  (greater  than  600  hp 
[447  kW])  is  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production.  These  engines,  in  groups  of  three  to 
five,  supply  mechanical  power  to  operate  drilling  (rotary  table),  mud  pumping,  and  hoisting 
equipment,  and  may  also  operate  pumps  or  auxiliary  power  generators.  Another  frequent 
application  of  large  stationary  diesel  engines  is  electricity  generation  for  both  base  and  standby

service.  Smaller  uses  of  large  diesel  engines  include  irrigation,  hoisting,  and  nuclear  power 
plant  emergency  cooling  water  pump  operation.  The  category  of  smaller  diesel  engines  (up  to 
600  hp  [447  kW])  covers  a  wide  variety  of  industrial  applications  such  as  aerial  lifts,  fork  lifts, 
mobile  refrigeration  units,  generators,  pumps,  industrial  sweepers/scrubbers,  material  handling 
equipment  (such  as  conveyors),  and  portable  well-drilling  equipment.  The  rated  power  of 
these  engines  can  be  up  to  250  hp  (186  kW),  and  substantial  differences  in  engine  duty  cycles 
exist.232 


Gasoline-Spark  ignition  initiates  combustion  by  the  spark  of  an  electrical 
discharge.  Usually,  fuel  is  mixed  with  the  air  in  a  carburetor,  but  occasionally  fuel  is  injected 
into  the  compressed  air  in  the  cylinder.  All  gasoline  reciprocating  engines  are  spark-ignited. 
Gasoline  engines  up  to  600  hp  (447  kW)  can  be  used  interchangeably  with  diesel  IC  engines  in 
the  same  industrial  applications  described  previously.  As  with  diesel  engines,  substantial 
differences  in  gasoline  engine  duty  cycles  exist.231 

Natural  Gas-Most  reciprocating  IC  engines  that  use  natural  gas  are  of  the 
spark-ignited  type.  As  with  gasoline  engines,  the  gas  is  first  mixed  with  the  combustion  air  at 
an  intake  valve,  but  occasionally  the  fuel  is  injected  into  the  compressed  air  in  the  cylinder. 
Natural  gas  can  be  used  in  a  compression  ignition  engine,  but  only  if  a  small  amount  of  diesel 
fuel  is  injected  into  the  compressed  air/gas  mixture  to  initiate  combustion;  hence  the  name 
dual-fuel  engine.  Dual-fuel  engines  were  developed  to  obtain  compression  ignition 
performance  and  the  economy  of  natural  gas,  using  a  minimum  of  5  to  6  percent  diesel  fuel  to 
ignite  the  natural  gas.  Large  dual-fuel  engines  have  been  used  almost  exclusively  for  prime 
electric  power  generation.231 

Natural  gas-fired  stationary  IC  engines  are  also  used  in  the  natural  gas  industry, 
primarily  to  power  compressors  used  for  pipeline  transportation,  field  gathering  (collecting  gas 
from  wells),  underground  storage,  and  gas  processing  plant  applications  (i.e.,  prime  movers). 
Pipeline  engines  are  concentrated  in  the  major  gas-producing  states  (such  as  those  along  the 
Gulf  Coast)  and  along  the  major  gas  pipelines.233 


7-70 


Reciprocating  IC  engines  used  in  the  natural  gas  industry  are  separated  into 
three  design  classes:  two-stroke  lean  bum,  four-stroke  lean  bum,  and  four-stroke  rich  bum. 
Each  of  these  have  design  differences  that  affect  both  baseline  emissions  as  well  as  the 
potential  for  emissions  control.  Two-stroke  engines  complete  the  power  cycle  in  a  single 
engine  revolution  compared  to  two  revolutions  for  four-stroke  engines.  With  the  two-stroke 
engine,  the  fuel/air  charge  is  injected  with  the  piston  near  the  bottom  of  the  power  stroke.  The 
valves  are  all  covered  or  closed  and  the  piston  moves  to  the  top  of  the  cylinder  compressing  the 
charge.  Following  ignition  and  combustion,  the  power  stroke  starts  with  the  downward 
movement  of  the  piston.  Exhaust  ports  or  valves  are  then  uncovered  to  remove  the  combustion 
products,  and  a  new  fuel/air  charge  is  ingested.  Two-stroke  engines  may  be  turbocharged 
using  an  exhaust-powered  turbine  to  pressurize  the  charge  for  injection  into  the  cylinder. 
Non-turbocharged  engines  may  be  either  blower-scavenged  or  piston-scavenged  to  improve 
removal  of  combustion  products.233 

F^ur-strok?  engines  use  a  separate  engine  revolution  for  the  intake/compression 

stroke  and  the  power/exhaust  stroke.  These  engines  may  be  either  naturally  aspirated,  using 
the  suction  from  the  piston  to  entrain  the  air  charge,  or  turbocharged,  using  a  turbine  to 
pressurize  the  charge.  Turbocharged  units  produce  a  higher  power  output  for  a  given  engine 
displacement,  whereas  naturally  aspirated  units  have  lower  initial  cost  and  maintenance. 
Rich-burn  engines  operate  near  the  fuel/air  stoichiometric  limit,  with  exhaust  excess  oxygen 
levels  less  than  4  percent.  Lean-bum  engines  may  operate  up  to  the  lean  flame  extinction 
limit,  with  exhaust  oxygen  levels  of  12  percent  or  greater.233 

Pipeline  population  statistics  show  a  nearly  equal  installed  capacity  of 
reciprocating  IC  engines  and  turbines.  Gas  turbines  emit  considerably  smaller  amounts  of 
pollutants  than  do  reciprocating  engines;  however,  reciprocating  engines  are  generally  more 
efficient  in  their  use  of  fuel.  For  reciprocating  engines,  two-stroke  designs  contribute 
approximately  two-thirds  of  installed  capacity  in  this  industry.233 


7-71 


Benzene  Emissions  From  Reciprocating  IC  Engines 


Most  of  the  pollutants  from  IC  engines  are  emitted  through  the  exhaust. 
However,  some  hydrocarbons  escape  from  the  crankcase  as  a  result  of  blowby  (gases  that  are 
vented  from  the  oil  pan  after  they  have  escaped  from  the  cylinder  past  the  piston  rings)  and 
from  the  fuel  tank  and  carburetor  because  of  evaporation.  Nearly  all  of  the  hydrocarbons  from 
diesel  engines  enter  the  atmosphere  from  the  exhaust.  Crankcase  blowby  is  minor  because 
hydrocarbons  are  not  present  during  compression  of  the  charge.  Evaporative  losses  are 
insignificant  in  diesel  engines  because  of  the  low  volatility  of  diesel  fuels.  In  general, 
evaporative  losses  are  also  negligible  in  engines  using  gaseous  fuels  because  these  engines 
receive  their  fuel  continuously  from  a  pipe  rather  than  via  a  fuel  storage  tank  and  fuel  pump. 


Emission  factors  for  uncontrolled  benzene  emissions  from  the  following 
reciprocating  engine  types  and  fuel  combinations  are  provided  in  Table  7-8: 

(1)  reciprocating/distillate  oil  and  publically  owned  treatment  works  (POTW)  digester  gas, 

(2)  cogeneration/distillate  oil,  (3)  2-cycle  lean  bum/natural  gas,  (4)  large  bore  engine/distillate 
oil,  and  (5)  large  bore  engine/distillate  oil  and  gas  (dual  fuel).  Additionally,  an  emission  factor 
for  benzene  emissions  after  a  non-selective  catalytic  reduction  control  device  is  provided  for  a 
natural  gas-fired,  4-cycle,  lean-bum  reciprocating  engine.3,231'233 


Control  Technologies  for  Reciprocating  Engines 


Control  measures  for  large  stationary  diesel  engines  to  date  have  been  directed 
mainly  at  limiting  NOx  emissions,  the  primary  pollutant  from  this  group  of  IC  engines.  All  of 
these  controls  are  engine  control  techniques  except  for  the  selective  catalytic  reduction  (SCR) 
technique,  which  is  a  post-combustion  control.  As  such,  all  of  these  controls  usually  affect  the 
emissions  profile  for  other  pollutants  as  well,  and  not  always  positively.  The  effectiveness  of 
controls  on  a  particular  engine  will  depend  on  the  specific  design  of  each  engine,  and  the 
effectiveness  of  each  technique  can  vary  considerably.

NSCR  =  nonselective  catalytic  reduction. 
POTW  =  publically  owned  treatment  works. 


Other  NOx  control  techniques  include  internal/external  exhaust  gas  recirculation 
(EGR),  combustion  chamber  modification,  manifold  air  cooling,  and  turbocharging.  Various 
other  emissions  reduction  technologies  may  be  applicable  to  the  smaller  diesel  and  gasoline 
engines.  These  technologies  are  categorized  into  fuel  modifications,  engine  modifications,  and 
exhaust  treatments. 

7.5.2  Gas  Turbines 

Stationary  gas  turbines  are  applied  in  electric  power  generators,  in  gas  pipeline 
pump  and  compressor  drives,  and  in  various  process  industries.  Gas  turbines  (greater  than 
3  MW(e)]  are  used  in  electrical  generation  for  continuous,  peaking,  or  standby  power.79  In 
1990,  the  actual  gas-fired  combustion  turbine  generating  capacity  for  electric  utilities  was 
8,524  MW.  234  The  current  average  size  of  electricity  generation  gas  turbines  is  approximately 
31  MW.  Turbines  are  also  used  in  industrial  applications,  but  information  was  not  available  to 
estimate  their  installed  capacity. 

The  same  fuels  used  in  reciprocating  engines  are  combusted  to  drive  gas 
turbines.  The  primary  fuels  used  are  natural  gas  and  distillate  (No.  2)  fuel  oil,  although 
residual  fuel  oil  is  used  in  a  few  applications.235  The  liquid  fuel  used  must  be  similar  in 
volatility  to  diesel  fuel  to  produce  droplets  that  penetrate  sufficiently  far  into  the  combustion 
chamber  to  ensure  efficient  combustion  even  when  a  pressure  atomizer  is  used.230 

Process  Description  for  Gas  Turbines 

Gas  turbines  are  so  named  not  because  they  are  gas-fired,  but  because 
combustion  exhaust  gas  drives  the  turbine.  Unlike  reciprocating  engines,  gas  turbines  operate 
in  steady  flow.  As  shown  in  Figure  7-17,  a  basic  gas  turbine  consists  of  a  compressor,  a 
combustor,  and  a  turbine.230  Combustion  air  enters  the  turbine  through  a  centrifugal

compressor,  where  the  pressure  is  raised  to  5  to  30  atmospheres,  depending  on  load  and  the 
design  of  the  engine.  Part  of  the  air  is  then  introduced  into  the  primary  combustion  zone,  into 
which  fuel  is  sprayed.  The  fuel  burns  in  an  intense  flame.  Gas  volume  increases  with 
combustion,  so  as  the  gases  pass  at  high  velocity  through  the  turbine,  they  generate  more  work 
than  is  required  to  drive  the  compressor.  This  additional  work  is  delivered  by  the  turbine  to  a 
shaft  to  drive  an  electric  power  generator  or  other  machinery.230 

Gas  turbines  may  be  classified  into  three  general  types:  simple-open-cycle, 
regenerative-open-cycle,  and  combined-cycle.  In  the  simple-open-cycle,  the  hot  gas  discharged 
from  the  turbine  is  exhausted  to  the  atmosphere.  In  the  regenerative-open-cycle,  the  gas 
discharged  from  the  turbine  is  passed  through  a  heat  exchanger  to  preheat  the  combustion  air. 
Preheating  the  air  increases  the  efficiency  of  the  turbine.  In  the  combined-cycle,  the  gas 
discharged  from  the  turbine  is  used  as  auxiliary  heat  for  a  steam  cycle.  Regenerative-type  gas 
turbines  constitute  only  a  very  small  fraction  of  the  total  gas  turbine  population.  Identical  gas 
turbines  used  m  me  combined-cycle  and  in  me  simple-cycle  tend  to  exhibit  the  same  emissions 
profiles.  Therefore,  usually  only  emissions  from  simple-cycles  are  evaluated.229 

Benzene  Emissions  From  Gas  Turbines 

Table  7-9  presents  emission  factors  for  controlled  benzene  emissions  from  two 
gas  turbines  utilized  for  electricity  generation.3 

Control  Technologies  for  Gas  Turbines 

As  with  reciprocating  engines,  NOx  is  the  primary  pollutant  from  gas  turbines 
that  controls  have  been  directed  at,  and  techniques  for  its  control  still  have  ramifications  for 
the  emissions  profiles  of  other  pollutants  such  as  hydrocarbons  (including  benzene).

Water/steam  injection  is  the  most  prevalent  NOx  control  for 
cogeneration/combined-cycle  gas  turbines.  Water  or  steam  is  injected  with  air  and  fuel  into  the 
turbine  combustor  in  order  to  lower  the  peak  temperatures,  which  in  turn  decreases  the  NOx 
produced.  The  lower  average  temperature  within  the  combustor  may  produce  higher  levels  of 
CO  and  hydrocarbons  as  a  result  of  incomplete  combustion.235 


As  described  in  the  previous  section,  SCR  is  a  post-combustion  control  that 
selectively  reduces  NOx  by  reaction  of  ammonia  and  NO  on  a  catalytic  surface  to  form  N2  and 
H20.  Although  SCR  systems  can  be  used  alone,  all  existing  applications  of  SCR  have  been 
used  in  conjunction  with  water/steam  injection  controls.  For  optimum  SCR  operation,  the  flue 
gas  must  be  within  a  temperature  range  of  600  to  800°F  (315  to  427°C),  with  the  precise 
limits  dependent  on  the  catalyst.  Some  SCR  systems  also  utilize  a  CO  catalyst  to  give 
simultaneous  catalytic  CO/NOx  control.235 


Advanced  combustor  designs  are  currently  being  phased  into  production 
turbines.  These  dry  techniques  decrease  turbine  emissions  by  modifying  the  combustion 
mixing,  air  staging,  and  flame  stabilization  to  allow  operation  at  a  much  leaner  air/fuel  ratio 
relative  to  normal  operation.  Operating  at  leaner  conditions  will  lower  peak  temperatures 
within  the  primary  flame  zone  of  the  combustor.  The  lower  temperatures  may  also  increase 
CO  and  hydrocarbon  emissions.235 

With  the  advancement  of  NOx  control  technologies  for  gas  turbines,  the 
emission  factors  for  the  installed  gas  turbine  population  are  quite  different  than  for 
uncontrolled  turbines.  However,  uncontrolled  turbine  emissions  have  not  changed 
significantly.  A  careful  review  of  specific  turbine  details  should  be  performed  before  applying 
uncontrolled  emission  factors.  Today,  most  gas  turbines  are  controlled  to  meet  local,  State, 
and  Federal  regulations.235

7.6 


SECONDARY  LEAD  SMELTING 


In  1990,  primary  and  secondary  smelters  in  the  United  States  produced 
1,380,000  tons  (1,255,000  Mg)  of  lead.  Secondary  lead  smelters  produced  946,000  tons 
(860,000  Mg)  or  about  69  percent  of  the  total  refined  lead  produced  in  1990;  primary  smelters 
produced  434,000  tons  (395,000  Mg).  Table  7-10  lists  U.S.  secondary  lead  smelters  according 
to  their  annual  lead  production  capacity.236 

7.6.1  Process  Description 

The  secondary  lead  smelting  industry  produces  elemental  lead  and  lead  alloys  by 
reclaiming  lead,  mainly  from  scrap  automobile  batteries.  Blast,  reverberatory,  rotary,  and 
electric  furnaces  are  used  for  smelting  scrap  lead  and  producing  secondary  lead.  Smelting  is 
the  reduction  of  lead  compounds  to  elemental  lead  in  a  high-temperature  furnace.  It  requires 
higher  temperature*  (2  200  to  2.300°F  [1 .200  to  1 .260°C])  than  those  required  for  melting 
elemental  lead  (621  °F  [327 °C]).  Secondary  lead  may  be  refmed  to  produce  soft  lead  (which  is 
nearly  pure  lead)  or  alloyed  to  produce  hard  lead  alloys.  Most  of  the  lead  produced  by 
secondary  lead  smelters  is  hard  lead,  which  is  used  in  the  production  of  lead-acid  batteries.236 

Lead-acid  batteries  represent  about  90  percent  of  the  raw  materials  at  a  typical 
secondary  lead  smelter,  although  this  percentage  may  vary  from  one  plant  to  the  next.  These 
batteries  contain  approximately  18  lb  (8.2  kg)  of  lead  per  battery  consisting  of  40  percent  lead 
alloys  and  60  percent  lead  oxide.  Other  types  of  lead-bearing  raw  materials  recycled  by 
secondary  lead  smelters  include  drosses  (lead-containing  byproducts  of  lead  refining),  which 
may  be  purchased  from  companies  that  perform  lead  alloying  or  refining  but  not  smelting; 
battery  plant  scrap,  such  as  defective  grids  or  paste;  and  scrap  lead,  such  as  old  pipes  or  roof 
flashing.  Other  scrap  lead  sources  include  cable  sheathing,  solder,  and  babbitt  metal.236 

As  illustrated  in  Figure  7-18,  the  normal  sequence  of  operations  in  a  secondary 
lead  smelter  is  scrap  receiving,  charge  preparation,  furnace  smelting,  and  lead  refining  and

cases.  Float/sink  separation  systems  are  typically  used  to  separate  plastic  battery  parts,  lead 
terminals,  lead  oxide  paste,  and  rubber  parts.  The  majority  of  lead  smelters  recover  the 
crushed  plastic  materials  for  recycling.  Rubber  casings  are  usually  landfilled. 


Paste  desulfurization,  an  optional  lead  recovery  step  used  by  secondary  lead 
smelters,  requires  the  separation  of  lead  sulfate  and  lead  oxide  paste  from  the  lead  grid  metal, 
polypropylene  plastic  cases,  separators,  and  hard  rubber  battery  cases.  Paste  desulfurization 
involves  the  chemical  removal  of  sulfur  from  the  lead  banery  paste.  The  process  improves 
furnace  efficiency  by  reducing  the  need  for  fluxing  agents  to  reduce  lead-sulfur  compounds  to 
lead  metal.  The  process  also  reduces  S02  furnace  emissions.  However,  S02  emissions 
reduction  is  usually  a  less  important  consideration  because  many  plants  that  perform  paste 
desulfurization  are  also  equipped  with  S02  scrubbers.  About  half  of  all  smelters  perform  paste 
desulfurization. 


After  removing  the  lead  components  from  the  charge  batteries,  the  lead  scrap  is 
combined  with  other  charge  materials  such  as  refining  drosses,  flue  dust,  furnace  slag,  coke, 
limestone,  sand,  and  scrap  iron  and  fed  to  either  a  reverberatory,  blast,  rotary  or  electric 
smelting  furnace.  Smelting  furnaces  are  used  to  produce  crude  lead  bullion,  which  is  refined 
and/or  alloyed  into  final  lead  products. 

Refining,  the  final  step  in  secondary  lead  production,  consists  of  removing 
impurities  and  adding  alloying  metals  to  the  molten  lead  obtained  from  the  smelting  furnaces  to 
meet  a  customer's  specifications.  Refining  kettles  are  used  for  the  purifying  and  alloying  of 
molten  lead.

Blast  and  reverberatory  furnaces  are  currently  the  most  common  types  of 
smelting  furnaces  in  the  industry,  although  some  new  plants  are  using  rotary  furnaces.  There 
are  currently  about  15  reverberatory  furnaces,  24  blast  furnaces,  5  rotary  furnaces,  and 
1  electric  furnace  in  the  secondary  lead  industry.236  The  following  discussion  provides  process 
descriptions  of  these  four  types  of  secondary  lead  smelters. 

Reverberatory  Furnaces 

A  reverberatory  furnace  (Figure  7-19)  is  a  rectangular  refractory-lined 
furnace.236  Reverberatory  furnaces  are  operated  on  a  continuous  basis.  Natural  gas-  or  fuel 
oil-fired  jets  located  at  one  end  or  at  the  sides  of  the  furnace  are  used  to  heat  the  furnace  and 
charge  material  to  an  operating  temperature  of  about  2,000°F  (1,100°C).  Oxygen  enrichment 
may  be  used  to  decrease  the  combustion  air  requirements.  Reverberatory  furnaces  are 
maintained  at  negative  pressure  by  an  induced  draft  fan. 

Reverberatory  furnace  charge  materials  include  battery  grids  and  paste,  battery 
plant  scrap,  rerun  reverberatory  furnace  slag,  flue  dust,  drosses,  iron,  silica,  and  coke.  A 
typical  charge  over  one  hour  may  include  9.3  tons  (8.4  Mg)  of  grids  and  paste  to  produce 

6.2  tons  (5.6  Mg)  of  lead.236 

Charge  materials  are  often  fed  to  a  natural  gas-  or  oil-fired  rotary  drying  kiln, 
which  dries  the  material  before  it  reaches  the  furnace.  The  temperature  of  the  drying  kiln  is 
about  400  °F  (200  °C),  and  the  drying  kiln  exhaust  is  drawn  directly  into  the  reverberatory 
furnace  or  ventilated  to  a  control  device.  From  the  rotary  drying  kiln,  the  feed  is  either 
dropped  into  the  top  of  the  furnace  through  a  charging  chute,  or  fed  into  the  furnace  at  fixed 
intervals  with  a  hydraulic  ram.  In  furnaces  that  use  a  feed  chute,  a  hydraulic  ram  is  often  used 
as  a  stoker  to  move  the  material  down  the  furnace. 

Reverberatory  furnaces  are  used  to  produce  a  soft  (nearly  pure)  lead  product  and 
a  lead-bearing  slag.  This  is  done  by  controlling  the  reducing  conditions  in  the  furnace  so  that

lead  components  are  reduced  to  metallic  lead  bullion  and  the  alloying  elements  (antimony,  tin, 
arsenic)  in  the  battery  grids,  posts,  straps,  and  connectors  are  oxidized  and  removed  in  the 
slag.  The  reduction  of  PbS04  and  PbO  is  promoted  by  the  carbon-containing  coke  added  to  the 
charge  material: 


PbS04  +  C  -  Pb  +  C02  +  S02 
2PbO  +  C  -  2Pb  +  C02 

The  PbS04  and  PbO  also  react  with  the  alloying  elements  to  form  lead  bullion 
and  oxides  of  the  alloying  elements,  which  are  removed  in  the  slag. 

The  molten  lead  collects  in  a  pool  at  the  lowest  part  of  the  hearth.  Slag  collects 
in  a  layer  on  top  of  this  pool  and  retards  further  oxidation  of  the  lead.  The  slag  is  made  up  of 
molten  fluxing  agents  such  as  iron,  silica,  and  lime,  and  typically  has  significant  quantities  of 
lead.  Slag  is  usually  tapped  continuously  and  lead  is  tapped  intermittently.  The  slag  is  tapped 
into  a  crucible.  The  slag  tap  and  crucible  are  hooded  and  vented  to  a  control  device. 
Reverberatory  furnace  slag  usually  has  a  high  lead  content  (as  much  as  70  percent  by  weight) 
and  is  used  as  feed  material  in  a  blast  or  electric  furnace  to  recover  the  lead  content. 
Reverberatory  furnace  slag  may  also  be  rerun  through  the  reverberatory  furnace  during  special 
slag  campaigns  before  being  sent  to  a  blast  or  electric  furnace.  Lead  may  be  tapped  into  a 
crucibie  or  directly  into  a  holding  kettle.  The  lead  tap  is  usually  hooded  and  vented  to  a 
control  device.236 

Blast  Furnaces 

A  blast  furnace  (Figure  7-20)  is  a  vertical  furnace  that  consists  of  a  crucible  with 
a  vertical  cylinder  affixed  to  the  top.  The  crucible  is  refractory-lined  and  the  vertical  cylinder 
consists  of  a  steel  water  jacket.  Oxygen-enriched  combustion  air  is  introduced  into  the  furnace 
through  tuyeres  located  around  the  base  of  the  cylinder. 


7-85

ERG_Lead_44.pre 


Charge  materials  are  pre-weighed  to  ensure  the  proper  mixture  and  then 
introduced  into  the  top  of  the  cylinder  using  a  skip  hoist,  a  conveyor,  or  a  front-end  loader. 

The  charge  fills  nearly  the  entire  cylinder.  Charge  material  is  added  periodically  to  keep  the 
level  of  the  charge  at  a  consistent  working  height  while  lead  and  slag  are  tapped  from  the 
crucible.  Coke  is  added  to  the  charge  as  the  primary  fuel,  although  natural  gas  jets  may  be 
used  to  start  the  combustion  process.  Combustion  is  self-sustaining  as  long  as  there  is 
sufficient  coke  in  the  charge  material.  Combustion  occurs  in  the  layer  of  the  charge  nearest  the 
tuyeres. 


At  plants  that  operate  only  blast  furnaces,  the  lead-bearing  charge  materials  may 
include  broken  battery  components,  drosses  from  the  refining  kettles,  agglomerated  flue  dust, 

and  lead-bearing  slag.  A  typical  charge  over  one  hour  may  include  4.8  tons  (4.4  Mg)  of  grids 
and  paste,  0.3  tons  (0.3  Mg)  of  coke,  0.1  tons  (0.1  Mg)  of  calcium  carbonate,  0.07  tons 
(0.06  Mg)  of  silica,  0.5  tons  (0.4  Mg)  of  cast  iron,  and  0.2  tons  (0.2  Mg)  of  rerun  blast 
furnace  slag,  to  produce  3  7  tons  (3.3  Mg')  of  lead  At  plant*  that  also  have  a  reverberatorv 
furnace,  the  charge  materials  will  also  include  lead-bearing  reverberatory  furnace  slag.236 

Blast  furnaces  are  designed  and  operated  to  produce  a  hard  (high  alloy  content) 
lead  product  by  achieving  more  reducing  furnace  conditions  than  those  typically  found  in  a 
reverberator}'  furnace.  Fluxing  agents  include  iron,  soda  ash,  limestone,  and  silica  (sand). 

The  oxidation  of  the  iron,  limestone,  and  silica  promotes  the  reduction  of  lead  compounds  and 
prevents  oxidation  of  the  lead  and  other  metals.  The  soda  ash  enhances  the  reaction  of  PbS04 
and  PbO  with  carbon  from  the  coke  to  reduce  these  compounds  to  lead  metal. 

Lead  tapped  from  a  blast  furnace  has  a  higher  content  of  alloying  metals  (up  to 
25  percent)  than  lead  produced  by  a  reverberatory  furnace.  In  addition,  much  less  of  the  lead 
and  alloying  metals  are  oxidized  and  removed  in  the  slag,  so  the  slag  has  a  low  metal  content 
(e.g.,  1  to  3  percent)  and  frequently  qualifies  as  a  nonhazardous  solid  waste. 


7-87 


Because  air  is  introduced  into  the  blast  furnace  at  the  tuyeres,  blast  furnaces  are 
operated  at  positive  pressure.  The  operating  temperature  at  the  combustion  layer  of  the  charge 
is  between  2,200  and  2,600°F  (1,200  and  1,400°C),  but  the  temperature  of  the  gases  exiting 
the  top  of  the  charge  material  is  only  between  750  and  950  °F  (400  and  500  °C). 

Molten  lead  collects  in  the  crucible  beneath  a  layer  of  molten  slag.  As  in  a 
reverberatory  furnace,  the  slag  inhibits  the  further  oxidation  of  the  molten  metal.  Lead  is 
tapped  continuously  and  slag  is  tapped  intermittently,  slightly  before  it  reaches  the  level  of  the 
tuyeres.  If  the  tuyeres  become  blocked  with  slag,  they  are  manually  or  automatically 
“punched”  to  clear  the  slag.  A  sight  glass  on  the  tuyeres  allows  the  furnace  operator  to 
monitor  the  slag  level  and  ensure  that  they  are  clear  of  slag.  At  most  facilities,  the  slag  tap  is 
temporarily  sealed  with  a  clay  plug,  which  is  driven  out  to  begin  the  flow  of  slag  from  the  tap 
into  a  crucible.  The  slag  tap  and  crucible  are  enclosed  in  a  hood,  which  is  vented  to  a  control 
device. 


A  weir  dam  and  siphon  in  the  furnace  are  used  to  remove  the  lead  from  beneath 
the  slag  layer.  Lead  is  tapped  from  a  blast  furnace  into  either  a  crucible  or  directly  to  a 
refining  kettle  designated  as  a  holding  kettle.  The  lead  in  the  holding  kettle  is  kept  molten 
before  being  pumped  to  a  refining  kettle  for  refining  and  alloying.  The  lead  tap  on  a  blast 
furnace  is  hooded  and  vented  to  a  control  device. 

Rotary  Furnaces 

As  noted  above,  rotary  furnaces  (sometimes  referred  to  as  rotary  reverberatory 
furnaces)  (Figure  7-21)  are  used  at  only  a  few  recently  constructed  secondary  lead  smelters  in 
the  United  States.236  Rotary  furnaces  have  two  advantages  over  other  furnace  types:  it  is 
easier  to  adjust  the  relative  amount  of  fluxing  agents  because  the  furnaces  are  operated  on  a 
batch  rather  than  a  continuous  basis,  and  they  achieve  better  mixing  of  the  charge  materials 
than  do  blast  or  reverberatory  furnaces.

ERG_IEAD_45  pr» 


A  rotary  furnace  consists  of  a  refractory-lined  steel  drum  mounted  on  rollers. 
Variable-speed  motors  are  used  to  rotate  the  drum.  An  oxygen-enriched  natural  gas  or  fuel  oil 
jet  at  one  end  of  the  furnace  heats  the  charge  material  and  the  refractory  lining  of  the  drum. 

The  connection  to  the  flue  is  located  at  the  same  end  as  the  jet.  A  sliding  door  at  the  end  of  the 
furnace  opposite  from  the  jet  allows  charging  of  material  to  the  furnace.  Charge  materials  are 
typically  placed  in  the  furnace  using  a  retractable  conveyor  or  charge  bucket,  although  other 
methods  are  possible. 

Lead-bearing  raw  materials  charged  to  rotary  furnaces  include  broken  battery 
components,  flue  dust,  and  drosses.  Rotary  furnaces  can  use  the  same  lead-bearing  raw 
materials  as  reverberatory  furnaces,  but  they  produce  slag  that  is  relatively  free  of  lead,  less 
than  2  percent.  As  a  result,  a  blast  furnace  is  not  needed  for  recovering  lead  from  the  slag, 
which  can  be  disposed  of  as  a  nonhazardous  waste. 

Fluxing  agents  for  rotary  furnaces  may  include  iron,  silica,  soda  ash.  limestone, 
and  coke.  The  fluxing  agents  are  added  to  promote  the  conversion  of  lead  compounds  to  lead 
metal.  Coke  is  used  as  a  reducing  agent  rather  than  as  a  primary  fuel.  A  typical  charge  may 
consist  of  12  tons  (11  Mg)  of  wet  battery  scrap,  0.8  tons  (0.7  Mg)  of  soda  ash,  0.6  tons 
(0.5  Mg)  of  coke,  and  0.6  tons  (0.5  Mg)  of  iron.  This  charge  will  yield  approximately  9  tons 
(8  Mg)  of  lead  product.236 

The  lead  produced  by  rotary  furnaces  is  a  semi-soft  lead  with  an  antimony 
content  somewhere  between  that  of  lead  from  reverberatory  and  blast  furnaces.  Lead  and  slag 
are  tapped  from  the  furnace  at  the  conclusion  of  the  smelting  cycle.  Each  batch  takes  5  to 
12  hours  to  process,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  furnace.  Like  reverberatory  furnaces,  rotary 
furnaces  are  operated  at  a  slight  negative  pressure. 


.  7-90 


Electric  Furnaces 


An  electric  furnace  consists  of  a  large,  steel,  kettle-shaped  container  that  is 
refractory-lined  (Figure  7-22). 236  A  cathode  extends  downward  into  the  container  and  an  anode 
is  located  in  the  bottom  of  the  container.  Second-run  reverberatory  furnace  slag  is  charged 
into  the  top  of  the  furnace.  Lead  and  slag  are  tapped  from  the  bottom  and  side  of  the  furnace, 
respectively.  A  fume  hood  covering  the  top  of  the  furnace  is  vented  to  a  control  device. 

In  an  electric  furnace,  electric  current  flows  from  the  cathode  to  the  anode 
through  the  scrap  charge.  The  electrical  resistance  of  the  charge  causes  the  charge  to  heat  up 
and  become  molten.  There  is  no  combustion  process  involved  in  an  electric  furnace. 

There  is  only  one  electric  furnace  in  operation  in  the  U.S.  secondary  lead 
industry.  It  is  used  to  process  second-run  reverberatory  furnace  slag,  and  it  fulfills  the  same 
role  as  a  blast  furnace  used  in  conjunction  with  a  reverberatory  furnace.  However,  the  electric 
furnace  has  two  advantages  over  a  blast  furnace.  First,  because  there  are  no  combustion  gases, 
ventilation  requirements  are  much  lower  than  for  blast  or  reverberatory  furnaces,  and  the 
potential  for  formation  of  organics  is  greatly  reduced.  Second,  the  electric  furnace  is 
extremely  reducing,  and  produces  a  glass-like,  nearly  lead-free  slag  that  is  nonhazardous. 

7.6.2  Benzene  Emissions  From  Secondary  Lead  Smelters 

Process  emissions  (i.e.,  those  emitted  from  the  smelting  furnace's  main  exhaust) 
contain  metals,  organics  (including  benzene),  HC1,  and  Cl2.  Process  emissions  also  contain 
other  pollutants,  including  PM,  VOC,  CO,  and  S02. 

Blast  furnaces  are  substantially  greater  sources  of  benzene  emissions  than 
reverberatory  or  rotary  furnaces.  Low  exhaust  temperatures  from  the  charge  column  (about 
800 °F  [430 °C])  result  in  the  formation  of  PICs  from  the  organic  material  in  the  feed  material. 


7-91 


Uncontrolled  THC  emissions  (which  correlate  closely  with  organic  pollutant  emissions)  from  a 
typical  55,000-tons/yr  (50,000  Mg/yr)  blast  furnace  are  about  309  tons/yr  (280  Mg/yr).236 

Controlled  blast  furnace  benzene  emissions  are  dependent  on  the  add-on  controls 
that  are  used,  which  may  be  anywhere  from  80  to  99  percent  effective  at  reducing  THC 
emissions.  Rotary  and  reverberatory  furnaces  have  much  higher  exhaust  temperatures  than 
blast  furnaces,  about  1,800  to  2,200°F  (980  to  1,200°C),  and  much  lower  THC  emissions 
because  of  more  complete  combustion.  Total  hydrocarbon  emissions  from  a  typical  rotary 
furnace  (16,500  tons/yr  [15,000  Mg/vr]  capacity)  are  about  38  tons/yr  (34  Mg/yr).  The 
majority  of  these  emissions  occur  during  furnace  charging,  when  the  furnace's  burner  is  cut 
back  and  the  temperature  is  reduced.  Emissions  drop  off  sharply  when  charging  is  completed 
and  the  furnace  is  brought  to  normal  operating  temperature.236  Benzene  emissions  from 
reverberatory  furnaces  are  even  lower  than  those  from  rotary  furnaces  because  reverberatory 
furnaces  are  operated  continuously  rather  than  on  a  batch  basis. 

Three  test  reports  from  three  secondary  lead  smelters  were  used  to  develop 
benzene  emission  factors.237'240  All  testing  was  conducted  in  support  of  the  EPA's  Secondary 
Lead  National  Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  (NESHAP)  program.  The 
three  facilities  tested  represent  the  following  process  configurations:  a  rotary  smelting  furnace 
equipped  with  a  baghouse  and  S02  scrubber;  a  blast  furnace  equipped  with  an  afterburner, 
baghouse,  and  S02  scrubber;  and  a  reverberatory  and  blast  furnace  with  exhaust  from  each 
furnace  combined  prior  to  a  single  afterburner,  baghouse,  and  S02  scrubber. 

Uncontrolled  VOC  emissions  were  measured  at  all  three  facilities  using 
VOST.241  Nineteen  VOC,  including  benzene,  were  detected  by  the  VOST.  Benzene  emissions 
were  measured  at  the  blast  furnace  outlet  (before  the  afterburner)  at  two  facilities,  and  at  the 
rotary  furnace  outlet  at  one  facility.  Total  hydrocarbon  emissions  were  measured  at  both  the 
blast  furnace  and  rotary  furnace  outlets  and  at  the  afterburner  outlets  following  the  blast 
furnaces.  Emission  factors  for  benzene  are  shown  in  Table  7-1 1.237*240  Although  benzene 
emissions  were  not  measured  after  the  control  device,  controlled  emission  factors  were

THC. 

7.6.3  Control  Technologies  for  Secondary  Lead  Smelters 

Controls  used  to  reduce  organic  emissions  from  smelting  furnaces  in  the 
secondary  lead  smelting  industry  include  afterburners  on  blast  furnaces  and  combined  blast  and 
reverberatory  exhausts.  Reverberatory  and  rotary  furnaces  have  minimal  benzene  emissions 
because  of  high  exhaust  temperatures  and  turbulence,  which  promote  complete  combustion  of 
organics.  No  controls  for  THC  are  necessary  for  these  process  configurations.236 

Benzene  emissions  from  blast  furnaces  are  dependent  on  the  type  of  add-on 
control  used.  An  afterburner  operated  at  1,300°F  (700°C)  achieves  about  84  percent 
destruction  efficiency  of  THC  236  Facilities  with  blast  and  reverberatory  furnaces  usually 
combine  the  exhaust  streams  and  vent  the  combined  stream  to  an  afterburner.  The  higher 
operating  temperature  of  the  reverberatory  furnace  reduces  the  fuel  needs  of  the  afterburner  so 
that  the  afterburner  is  essentially  “idling.”  Any  temperature  increase  measured  across  the 
afterburner  is  due  to  the  heating  value  of  organic  compounds  in  the  blast  furnace  exhaust.  A 
combined  reverberatory  and  blast  furnace  exhaust  stream  ducted  to  an  afterburner  with  an  exit 
temperature  of  1,700°F  (930°C)  can  achieve  99-percent  destruction  efficiency  for  THC.236 

Additional  controls  used  by  secondary  lead  smelters  include  baghouses  for 
paniculate  and  metal  control,  hooding  and  ventilation  to  a  baghouse  for  process  fugitives,  and 
scrubbers  for  HC1  and  S02  control.236 

7.7  IRON  AND  STEEL  FOUNDRIES 

Iron  and  steel  foundries  can  be  defmed  as  those  that  produce  gray,  white, 
ductile,  or  malleable  iron  and  steel  castings.  Cast  iron  and  steels  are  both  solid  solutions  of 


7-95 


iron,  carbon,  and  various  alloying  materials.  Although  there  are  many  types  of  each,  the  iron 
and  steel  families  can  be  distinguished  by  their  carbon  content.  Cast  irons  typically  contain 
2  percent  carbon  or  greater;  cast  steels  usually  contain  less  than  2  percent  carbon.242 

Iron  castings  are  used  in  almost  all  types  of  equipment,  including  motor 
vehicles,  farm  machinery,  construction  machinery,  petroleum  industry  equipment,  electrical 
motors,  and  iron  and  steel  industry  equipment.  Steel  castings  are  classified  on  the  basis  of 
their  composition  and  heat  treatment,  which  determine  their  end  use.  Steel  casting 
classifications  include  carbon,  low-alloy,  general-purpose-structural,  heat-resistant, 
corrosion-resistant,  and  wear-resistant.  They  are  used  in  motor  vehicles,  railroad  equipment, 
construction  machinery,  aircraft,  agricultural  equipment,  ore  refining  machinery,  and  chemical 
manufacturing  equipment. ;4: 


Based  on  a  survey  conducted  by  EPA  in  support  of  the  iron  and  steel  foundry 
MACT  standard  development,  there  were  756  iron  and  steel  foundries  in  the  United  States  in 
1992. 243  Foundry  locations  can  be  correlated  with  areas  of  heavy  industry  and  manufacturing 
and,  in  general,  with  the  iron  and  steel  production  industry  (Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  and  Indiana).

7.7.1 


Pisces?  Description  for  Iron  and  Steel  Foundries 


The  following  four  basic  operations  are  performed  in  all  iron  and  steel 

foundries: 


•  Storage  and  handling  of  raw  materials; 

•  Melting  of  the  raw  materials; 

•  Transfer  of  the  hoi  molten  metal  into  molds,  and 

•  Preparation  of  the  molds  to  hold  the  molten  metal. 

Other  processes  present  in  most,  but  not  all,  foundries  include: 

•  Sand  preparation  and  handling; 

•  Mold  cooling  and  shakeout; 

•  Casting  cleaning,  heat  treating,  and  finishing; 

•  Coremaking;  and 

•  Pattern  making. 

A  generic  process  flow  diagram  for  iron  and  steel  foundries  is  given  in  Figure  7-23. 242 
Figure  7-24  depicts  the  emission  points  in  a  typical  iron  foundry.244 

Iron  and  steel  castings  are  produced  in  a  foundry  by  injecting  or  pouring  molten 

metal  into  cavities  of  a  mold  made  of  sand,  metal,  or  ceramic  material.  Input  metal  is  melted 
by  the  use  of  a  cupola,  an  electric  arc  furnace,  or  an  induction  furnace.  About  70  percent  of 
all  iron  castings  are  produced  using  cupolas,  with  lesser  amounts  produced  in  electric  arc  and 
induction  furnaces.  However,  the  use  of  electric  arc  furnaces  in  iron  foundries  is  increasing. 
Steel  foundries  rely  almost  exclusively  on  electric  arc  or  induction  furnaces  for  melting 
purposes.  With  either  type  of  foundry,  when  the  poured  metal  has  solidified,  the  molds  are 
separated  and  the  castings  removed  from  the  mold  flasks  on  a  casting  shakeout  unit.  Abrasive

(shotblasting)  cleaning,  grinding,  and  heat  treating  are  performed  as  necessary.  The  castings 
are  then  inspected  and  shipped  to  another  industry  for  machining  and/or  assembly  into  a  final 
product.242 


In  a  typical  foundry  operation,  charges  to  the  melting  unit  are  sorted  by  size  and 
density  and  cleaned  (as  required)  prior  to  being  put  in  the  melter.  Charges  consist  of  scrap 
metal,  ingot,  carbon  (coke),  and  flux.  Prepared  charge  materials  are  placed  in  crane  buckets, 
weighed,  and  transferred  into  the  melting  furnace  or  cupola.  The  charge  in  a  furnace  or  cupola 
is  heated  until  it  reaches  a  certain  temperature  and  the  desired  chemistry  of  the  melt  has  been 
attained.  After  the  desired  product  is  obtained,  the  molten  metal  is  either  poured  out  of  the 
furnace  into  various  sized  teeming  ladles  and  then  into  the  molds  or  it  is  transferred  to  holding 
furnaces  for  later  use. 

7.7.2  Benzene  Emissions  From  Iron  and  Steel  Foundries 

Organic  compounds  are  emitted  from  various  process  steps  in  an  iron  and  steel 
foundry,  including  scrap  preparation,  the  furnace,  tapping  and  treating,  mold  pouring  and 
cooling,  casting  shakeout,  sand  cooling,  and  mold  and  core  production.  Benzene  may  be 
included  among  other  organic  compounds  emitted  from  these  process  steps.  Sources  of 
organic  emissions  during  these  process  steps  include  solvent  degreasers  used  during  scrap  iron 
charge,  coke,  and  organic  binders  and  organic  polymer  networks  that  hold  molds  and  cores 
together  to  form  the  castings. 

Data  from  one  testing  program  at  a  single  gray  iron  foundry  were  averaged  to 
develop  a  benzene  emission  factor  (Table  7-12).  The  emission  sources  tested  were  sand  cooler 
and  belts,  casting  shakeouts  and  mixers,  and  pouring  and  cooling.  Vapors  from  the  sand 
cooler  and  belts  and  casting  shakeouts  and  mixers  were  collected  in  hoods  and  ducted  to  a 
baghouse.  Sampling  for  benzene  was  performed  in  accordance  with  EPA  Method  18.  All 
sampling  was  performed  at  the  stack,  after  the  control  devices.  Benzene  emissions  from  the 
three  emission  sources  were  detected;  however,  because  of  limited  process  data  availability,  a

benzene  emission  factor  could  only  be  calculated  for  the  sand  cooler  and  belts,  as  reflected  in 
Table  7-12.245-246 

Benzene  from  sand  coolers  and  belts  and  casting  shakeouts  and  mixers  may  be 
emitted  as  a  result  of  the  heating  during  mold  pouring  of  the  organic  binders  used  to  form  the 
casting.  During  mold  pouring,  the  binder  materials  in  the  mold  are  exposed  to  temperatures 
near  2,550°F  (1,400°C).  At  these  temperatures,  pyrolysis  of  the  chemical  binder  may  release 
organic  chemicals  which  become  trapped  in  the  sand  inside  the  casting.  During  shakeout  and 
sand  cooling,  the  sand  is  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  and  these  organic  chemicals  may  be 
released. 

7.7.3  Control  Technologies  for  Iron  and  Steel  Foundries244 

Scrap  preparation  with  heat  or  solvent  degreasers  will  emit  organic  compounds. 
Catalytic  incinerators  and  afterburners  can  control  about  95  percent  of  organic  emissions. 

Emissions  released  from  melting  furnaces  include  organic  compounds.  The 
highest  concentrations  of  furnace  emissions  occur  when  furnace  doors  are  open  during 
charging,  backcharging,  alloying,  slag  removal,  and  tapping  operations.  These  emissions  can 
escape  into  the  furnace  building  or  can  be  collected  and  vented  through  roof  openings. 
Emission  controls  for  melting  and  refining  operations  involve  venting  furnace  gases  and  fumes 
directly  to  a  control  device.  Canopy  hoods  or  special  hoods  near  furnace  doors  and  tapping 
points  capture  emissions  and  route  them  to  emission  control  systems. 

A  cupola  furnace  typically  has  an  afterburner,  which  achieves  up  to  95  percent 
efficiency.  The  afterburner  is  located  in  the  furnace  stack  to  oxidize  CO  and  bum  organic 
fumes,  tars,  and  oils.  Reducing  these  contaminants  protects  the  particulate  control  device  from 
possible  plugging  and  explosion.  Toxic  emissions  from  cupolas  include  both  organic  and 
inorganic  materials.  Cupolas  produce  the  most  toxic  emissions  compared  to  other  melting 
equipment.  During  melting  in  an  electric  arc  furnace,  hydrocarbons  are  emitted  from 


7-102 


vaporization  and  incomplete  combustion  of  any  oil  remaining  on  the  scrap  iron  charge. 

Electric  induction  furnaces  emit  negligible  amounts  of  hydrocarbon  emissions,  and  are 
typically  uncontrolled  except  during  charging  and  pouring  operations. 

Organic  emissions  are  generated  during  the  refining  of  molten  iron  before 
pouring  and  from  the  mold  and  core  materials  during  pouring.  Toxic  emissions  of  halogenated 
and  aromatic  hydrocarbons  are  released  in  the  refining  process.  Emissions  from  pouring 
normally  are  captured  by  a  collection  system  and  vented,  either  controlled  or  uncontrolled,  to 
the  atmosphere.  Emissions  continue  as  the  molds  cool. 

Organics  are  emitted  in  mold  and  core  production  operations  from  core  baking 

and  mold  drying.  Afterburners  and  catalytic  incinerators  can  be  used  to  control  organics 
emissions. 


In  addition  to  organic  binders,  molds  and  cores  may  be  held  together  in  the 
desired  shape  by  means  of  a  cross-linked  organic  polymer  network.  This  network  of  polymers 
undergoes  thermal  decomposition  when  exposed  to  the  very  high  temperatures  of  casting, 
typically  2,550°F  (1,400°C).  At  these  temperatures  it  is  likely  that  pyrolysis  of  the  chemical 
binder  will  produce  a  complex  of  free  radicals  that  will  recombine  to  form  a  wide  range  of 
chemical  compounds  having  widely  differing  concentrations. 

There  are  many  different  types  of  resins  currently  in  use,  with  diverse  and  toxic 
compositions.  No  data  are  available  for  determining  the  toxic  compounds  in  a  particular  resin 
that  are  emitted  to  the  atmosphere  and  to  what  extent  these  emissions  occur. 

7.8  PORTLAND  CEMENT  PRODUCTION 

Most  of  the  hydraulic  cement  produced  in  the  United  States  is  Portland 
cement-a  cementitious,  crystalline  compound  composed  of  metallic  oxides.  The  end-product 
cement,  in  its  fused  state,  is  referred  to  as  “clinker.”  Raw  materials  used  in  the  process  can  be 


7-103 


calcium  carbonate-  and  aluminum-containing  limestone,  iron,  silicon  oxides,  shale,  clay,  and 
sand.247  As  of  December  1990,  there  were  112  Portland  cement  plants  in  the  United  States 
operating  213  kilns  with  a  total  annual  clinker  capacity  of  80  million  tons  (73.7  million  Mg). 
The  kiln  population  included  80  wet  process  kilns  and  133  dry  process  kilns.247  U.S.  Portland 
cement  plants  are  listed  in  Table  7-13  . 

7.8.1  Process  Description  for  the  Portland  Cement  Industry 

In  Portland  cement  production,  most  raw  materials  typically  are  quarried  on  site 
and  transferred  by  conveyor  to  crushers  and  raw  mills.  After  the  raw  materials  are  reduced  to 
the  desired  particle  size,  they  are  blended  and  fed  to  a  large  rotary  kiln.  The  feed  enters  the 
kiln  at  the  elevated  end,  and  the  burner  is  located  at  the  opposite  end.  The  raw  materials  are 
then  changed  into  cementitious  oxides  of  metal  by  a  countercurrent  heat  exchange  process. 

The  materials  are  continuously  and  slowly  moved  to  the  low  end  by  the  rotation  of  the  kiln 
while  being  heated  to  high  temperatures  (2,700°F  [1,482°C])  by  direct  firing  (Stream  3  in 
Figure  7-25).  In  this  stage,  chemical  reactions  occur,  and  a  rock-like  substance  called 
“clinker”  is  formed.  This  clinker  is  then  cooled,  crushed,  and  blended  with  gypsum  to 
produce  Portland  cement.247  The  cement  is  then  either  bagged  or  bulk-loaded  and  transported 


Cement  may  be  made  via  a  wet  or  a  dry  process.  Many  older  kilns  use  the  wet 
process.  In  the  past,  wet  grinding  and  mixing  technologies  provided  more  uniform  and 
consistent  material  mixing,  resulting  in  a  higher  quality  clinker.  Dry  process  technologies 
have  improved,  however,  to  the  point  that  all  of  the  new  kilns  since  1975  use  the  dry 
process.249  In  the  wet  process,  water  is  added  to  the  mill  while  the  raw  materials  are  being 
ground.  The  resulting  slurry  is  fed  to  the  kiln.  In  the  dry  process,  raw  materials  are  also 
ground  finely  in  a  mill,  but  no  water  is  added  and  the  feed  enters  the  kiln  in  a  dry  state. 

More  fuel  is  required  for  the  wet  process  than  the  dry  process  to  evaporate  the 
water  from  the  feed.  However,  for  either  the  wet  or  dry  process,  Portland  cement  production 
is  fuel-intensive.  The  fuel  burned  in  the  kiln  may  be  natural  gas,  oil,  or  coal.  Many  cement

plants  bum  coal,  but  supplemental  fuels  such  as  waste  solvents,  chipped  rubber,  shredded 
municipal  garbage,  and  coke  have  been  used  in  recent  years.247  A  major  trend  in  the  industry 
is  the  increased  use  of  waste  fuels.  In  1989,  33  plants  in  the  United  States  and  Canada 
reported  using  waste  fuels;  the  number  increased  to  55  plants  in  1990. 247 

The  increased  use  of  hazardous  waste-derived  fuels  (HWDFs)  for  the  kilns  is 
attributed  to  lower  cost  and  increased  availability.  As  waste  generators  reduce  or  eliminate 
solvents  from  their  waste  steams,  the  streams  contain  more  sludge  and  solids.  As  a  result,  two 
new  hazardous  waste  fueling  methods  have  emerged  at  cement  kilns.  The  first  method  pumps 
solids  (either  slurried  with  liquids  or  dried  and  ground)  into  the  hot  end  of  the  kiln.  The 
second  method  (patented  by  cement  kiln  processor  and  fuel  blender  Cadence,  Inc.)  introduces 
containers  of  solid  waste  into  the  calcining  zone  of  the  kiln.250 

The  kiln  system  for  the  manufacture  of  Portland  cement  by  dry  process  with 
preheater  is  shown  in  Figure  7-25.  The  raw  material  enters  a  four-stage  suspension  preheater, 
where  hot  gases  from  the  kiln  heat  the  raw  feed  and  provide  about  40-percent  calcination 
(Stream  1)  before  the  feed  enters  the  kiln.  Some  installations  include  a  precalcining  furnace 
(Stream  2),  which  provides  about  85  percent  calcination  before  the  feed  enters  the  kiln.247 

7.8.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  the  Portland  Cement  Industry  and  Regulatory  Analysis 

The  raw  materials  used  by  some  facilities  may  contain  organic  compounds, 
which  become  a  source  of  benzene  emissions  during  the  heating  step.  However,  fuel 
combustion  to  heat  the  kiln  is  believed  to  be  the  greater  source  of  benzene  emissions.  As 
shown  in  Table  7-14,  benzene  is  emitted  when  either  fossil  fuels  or  HWDFs  are  combusted  in 
the  kiln.247  249-251 

Facilities  that  bum  HWDF  are  subject  to  the  Boilers  and  Industrial  Furnaces 
(BIF)  rule  promulgated  February  21,  1991,  under  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery 

Act  (RCRA).  The  BIF  rule  requires  that  a  facility  that  bums  hazardous  waste  demonstrate  a

7.9  HOT-MIX  ASPHALT  PRODUCTION 

In  1994,  there  were  approximately  3,600  asphalt  hot-mix  plants.252 
Approximately  40  percent  of  companies  that  operate  hot-mix  plants  operate  a  single  plant. 
Because  plants  must  be  located  near  the  job  site,  plants  are  concentrated  in  areas  where  the 
highway  and  road  network  is  concentrated.2^  Additional  information  on  the  locations  of 
individual  hot-mix  asphalt  facilities  can  be  obtained  by  contacting  the  National  Asphalt 
Pavement  Association  in  College  Park,  Maryland. 

7.9.1  Process  Description 

There  are  three  types  of  hot-mix  asphalt  plants  operating  in  the  United  States: 
batch-mix,  continuous-mix,  and  dmm-mix.  At  batch-mix  and  continuous-mix  plants,  the 
aggregate  drying  process  is  performed  separately  from  the  mixing  of  aggregate  with  asphalt 

cement.  Drum-mix  plants  combine  these  two  processes.  Production  capacities  for  all  three 
types  of  plants  range  from  40  to  600  tons  (36  to  544  Mg)  of  hot  mix  per  hour.  Almost  all 
plants  in  use  are  of  either  the  batch-mix  or  the  drum-mix  types.  Less  than  half  a  percent  of 
operating  hot-mix  asphalt  plants  are  of  the  continuous-mix  variety.79  Over  80  percent  of  all 
hot-mix  asphalt  production  plants  are  mobile.245 


7-110 


In  the  production  of  hot-mix  asphalt  (also  referred  to  as  asphalt  concrete), 
aggregate  is  heated  to  eliminate  moisture  and  then  mixed  with  hot  asphalt  cement.  The 
resulting  hot  mixture  is  pliable  and  able  to  be  compacted  and  smoothed.  When  the  hot-mix 
asphalt  cools  and  hardens,  it  provides  a  waterproof  and  durable  pavement  for  roads, 

driveways,  parking  lots,  and  runways. 

Aggregate,  the  basic  raw  material  of  hot-mix  asphalt,  consists  of  any  hard,  inert 
mineral  material,  usually  gravel,  sand,  and  mineral  filler.  Aggregate  typically  comprises 
between  90  and  95  percent  by  weight  of  the  asphalt  mixture.  Because  aggregate  provides  most 
of  the  load-bearing  properties  of  a  pavement,  the  performance  of  the  pavement  depends  on 
selection  of  the  proper  aggregate. 

Asphalt  cement  is  used  as  the  binding  agent  for  aggregate.  It  prevents 
moisture  from  penetrating  the  aggregate,  and  it  acts  as  a  cushioning  agent.  Typically,  asphalt 
cement  constitutes  4  to  0  percent  Dy  weignt  ot  a  not-mix  aspnait  mixture.15' 

As  with  the  asphalt  flux  used  to  produce  asphalt  roofing  products,  asphalt 
cement  is  obtained  from  the  distillation  of  crude  oil.  It  is  classified  into  grades  under  one  of 
several  classification  schemes.  The  most  commonly  used  scheme  classifies  asphalt  cement 
based  on  its  viscosity  at  140°F  (60 °C).  The  more  viscous  the  asphalt  cement,  the  higher  its 
numerical  rating.  An  asphalt  cement  of  grade  AC-40  is  considered  a  hard  asphalt  (i.e.,  a 
viscosity  of  4,000  grams  per  centimeter  per  second  [g/cm-s  or  poises]),  whereas  an  asphalt 
cement  of  grade  AC-2.5  is  considered  a  soft  asphalt  (i.e.,  a  viscosity  of  250  g/cm-s  [poises]). 

Several  western  States  use  a  second  classification  scheme  that  measures  viscosity 
of  the  asphalt  cement  after  a  standard  simulated  aging  period.  This  simulated  aging  period 
consists  of  exposure  to  a  temperature  of  325 °F  (163  °C)  for  5  hours.  Viscosity  is  measured  at 
140°F  (60  °C),  with  grades  ranging  from  AR-1000  for  a  soft  asphalt  cement  (1000  g/cm-s 
[poises])  to  AR- 16000  for  a  hard  asphalt  cement  (16,000  g/cm-s  [poises]). 


7-111 


A  third  classification  scheme  is  based  on  the  penetration  allowed  by  the  asphalt 
cement.  Grade  designation  40  to  50  means  that  a  needle  with  a  weight  attached  will  penetrate 
the  asphalt  cement  between  40  and  50  tenths  of  a  millimeter  under  standard  test  conditions. 
The  hard  asphalt  cements  have  penetration  ratings  of  40  to  50,  whereas  the  soft  grades  have 
penetration  ratings  of  200  to  300. 253 

The  asphalt  cement  grade  selected  for  different  hot-mix  asphalts  depends  on  the 
type  of  pavement  climate,  and  type  and  amount  of  traffic  expected.  Generally,  asphalt 
pavement  bearing  heavy  traffic  in  warm  climates  would  require  a  harder  asphalt  cement  than 
pavement  subject  to  either  light  traffic  or  cold  climate  conditions. 

Another  material  that  is  used  to  a  greater  extent  in  the  production  of  new  or 
virgin  hot-mix  asphalt  is  recycled  asphalt  pavement  (RAP),  which  is  pavement  material  that 
has  been  removed  from  existing  roadways.  This  RAP  material  is  now  used  by  virtually  all 
companies  m  their  hot-mix  asphalt  mixtures.  The  Surface  Transportation  Assistance  Act  of 
1982  encourages  recycling  by  providing  a  5-percent  increase  in  Federal  funds  to  State  agencies 
that  recycle  asphalt  pavement.  Rarely  does  the  RAP  comprise  more  than  60  percent  by  weight 
of  the  new  asphalt  mixture.  Twenty-five  percent  RAP  is  typical  in  batch  plants,  whereas  40  to 
50  percent  RAP  mixtures  are  typical  in  drum-mix  plants.253 

Rejuvenating  agents  are  sometimes  added  to  hot-mix  asphalts  where  they  are 
blended  with  RAP,  which  brings  the  weathered  and  aged  asphalt  cement  in  the  recycled 
mixture  up  to  the  specifications  of  a  new  asphalt  mixture.  Usually,  a  soft  asphalt  cement,  a 
specially  prepared  high-viscosity  oil,  or  a  hard  asphalt  cement  blended  with  a  low-viscosity  oil 
are  used  as  rejuvenating  agents.  The  amount  of  rejuvenating  agent  added  depends  on  the 
properties  of  the  RAP  and  on  the  specifications  for  the  hot-mix  asphalt  product. 

The  primary  processes  of  a  typical  batch-mix  hot-mix  asphalt  facility  are 
illustrated  in  Figure  7-26. 252  Aggregate  of  various  sizes  is  stockpiled  at  the  plant  for  easy 
access.  The  moisture  content  of  the  stockpiled  aggregate  usually  ranges  from  3  to  5  percent.

The  moisture  content  of  recycled  hot-mix  asphalt  typically  ranges  from  2  to  3  percent.  The 
different  sizes  of  aggregate  are  typically  transported  by  front-end  loader  to  separate  cold  feed 
bins  and  metered  onto  a  feeder  conveyor  belt  through  gates  at  thie  bottom  of  the  bins.  The 
aggregate  is  screened  before  it  is  fed  to  the  dryer  to  keep  oversize  material  out  of  the  mix. 

The  screened  aggregate  is  then  fed  to  a  rotating  dryer  with  a  burner  at  its  lower 
(discharge)  end  that  is  fired  with  fuel  oil,  natural  gas,  or  propane.  The  dryer  removes  moisture 
from  the  aggregate  and  heats  the  aggregate  to  the  proper  mix  temperature.  Inside  the  dryer  are 
longitudinal  flights  (metal  slats)  that  lift  and  tumble  the  aggregate,  causing  a  curtain  of  material 
to  be  exposed  to  the  heated  gas  stream.  This  curtain  of  material  provides  greater  heat  transfer 
to  the  aggregate  than  would  occur  if  the  aggregate  tumbled  along  the  bottom  of  the  drum 
towards  the  discharge  end.  Aggregate  temperature  at  the  discharge  end  of  the  dryer  is  about 
300  °F  (149°C).  The  amount  of  aggregate  that  a  dryer  can  heat  depends  on  the  size  of  the 
drum,  the  size  of  the  burner,  and  the  moisture  content  of  the  aggregate.  As  the  amount  of 
moisture  to  be  removed  from  the  aggregate  increases,  the  effective  production  capacity  of  the 
dryer  decreases. 

Vibrating  screens  segregate  the  heated  aggregate  into  bins  according  to  size.  A 
weigh  hopper  meters  the  desired  amount  of  the  various  sizes  of  aggregate  into  a  pugmill  mixer. 
The  pugmill  typically  mixes  the  aggregate  for  approximately  15  seconds  before  hot  asphalt 
cement  from  a  heated  tank  is  sprayed  into  the  pugmill.  The  pugmill  thoroughly  mixes  the 
aggregate  and  hot  asphalt  cement  for  25  to  60  seconds.  The  finished  hot-mix  asphalt  is  either 
directly  loaded  into  trucks  or  held  in  insulated  and/or  heated  storage  silos.  Depending  on  the 
production  specifications,  the  temperature  of  the  hot-mix  asphalt  product  mix  can  range  from 
225  to  350 °F  (107  to  177°C)  at  the  end  of  the  production  process. 

When  a  hot  mix  containing  RAP  is  produced,  the  aggregate  is  superheated 
(compared  to  totally  virgin  hot-mix  asphalt  production)  to  about  600 °F  (315°C)  to  ensure 
sufficient  heat  transfer  to  the  RAP  when  it  is  mixed  with  the  virgin  materials.  The  RAP 


7-114 


material  may  be  added  either  to  the  pugmill  mixer  or  at  the  discharge  end  of  the  dryer.  Rarely 
is  more  than  30  percent  RAP  used  in  batch  plants  for  the  production  of  hot-mix  asphalt. 


Continuous-mix  plants  are  very  similar  in  configuration  to  batch  plants. 
Continuous-mix  plants  have  smaller  hot  bins  (for  holding  the  heated  aggregate)  than  do  batch 
plants.  Little  surge  capacity  is  required  of  these  bins  because  the  aggregate  is  continuously 
metered  and  transported  to  the  mixer  inlet  by  a  conveyor  belt.  Asphalt  cement  is  continuously 
added  to  the  aggregate  at  the  inlet  of  the  mixer.  The  aggregate  and  asphalt  cement  are  mixed 
by  the  action  of  rotating  paddles  as  they  are  conveyed  through  the  mixer.  An  adjustable  dam  at 
the  outlet  end  of  the  mixer  regulates  the  mixing  time  and  also  provides  some  surge  capacity. 
The  finished  mix  is  transported  by  a  conveyor  belt  to  either  a  storage  silo  or  surge  bin.253 


Drum-mix  plants  dry  the  aggregate  and  mix  it  with  the  asphalt  cement  in  the 
same  drum,  eliminating  the  need  for  the  extra  conveyor  belt,  hot  bins  and  screens,  weigh 

hopper,  and  pugmill  of  batch-mix  plants.  The  drum  of  a  drum-mix  plant  is  much  like  the  drye: 

of  a  batch  plant,  but  it  typically  has  more  flights  than  do  batch  dryers  to  increase  veiling  of  the 
aggregate  and  to  improve  overall  heat  transfer.  The  burner  in  a  drum-mix  plant  emits  a  much 
bushier  flame  than  does  the  burner  in  a  batch  plant.  The  bushier  flame  is  designed  to  provide 
earlier  and  greater  exposure  of  the  virgin  aggregate  to  the  heat  of  the  flame.  This  design  also 
protects  the  asphalt  cement,  which  is  injected  away  from  the  direct  heat  of  the  flame.253 


Initially,  drum-mix  plants  were  designed  to  be  parallel  flow  as  depicted  in 
Figure  7-27. 252  Recently,  the  counterflow  drum-mix  plant  design  shown  in  Figure  7-28  has 
become  popular.79  The  parallel  flow  drum-mix  process  is  a  continuous  mixing  type  process 
using  proportioning  cold-feed  controls  for  the  process  materials.  Aggregate,  which  has  been 
proportioned  by  gradations,  is  introduced  to  the  drum  at  the  burner  end.  As  the  drum  rotates, 
the  aggregate  as  well  as  the  combustion  products  move  toward  the  other  end  of  the  drum  in 
parallel.  Liquid  asphalt  cement  flow  is  controlled  by  a  variable  flow  pump  that  is 
electronically  linked  to  the  virgin  aggregate  and  RAP  weigh  scales.  The  asphalt  cement  is

introduced  in  the  mixing  zone  midway  down  the  drum  in  a  lower  temperature  zone,  along  with 
any  RAP  and  PM  from  the  collectors.  The  mixture  is  discharged  at  the  end  of  the  drum  and 
conveyed  to  a  surge  bin  or  storage  silos.  The  exhaust  gases  also  exit  the  end  of  the  drum  and 
pass  on  to  the  collection  system.79 

In  the  counterflow  drum-mix  type  plant,  the  material  flow  in  the  drum  is 
opposite  or  counterflow  to  the  direction  of  exhaust  gases.  In  addition,  the  liquid  asphalt 
cement  mixing  zone  is  located  behind  the  burner  flame  zone  so  as  to  keep  the  materials  from 
direct  contact  with  hot  exhaust  gases.  Liquid  asphalt  cement  flow  is  still  controlled  by  a 
variable  flow  pump  and  is  injected  into  the  mixing  zone  along  with  any  RAP  and  PM  from 
primary  and  secondary  collectors.79 

Parallel-flow  drum  mixers  have  an  advantage  in  that  mixing  in  the  discharge  end 
of  the  drum  captures  a  substantial  portion  of  the  aggregate  dust,  thereby  lowering  the  load  on 
the  downstream  collection  equipment.  For  this  reason,  most  parallel  flow  drum  mixers  are 
followed  only  by  primary  collection  equipment  (usually  a  baghouse  or  venturi  scrubber). 
However,  because  the  mixing  of  aggregate  and  liquid  asphalt  cement  occurs  in  the  hot 
combustion  product  flow,  organic  emissions  (gaseous  and  liquid  aerosol)  from  parallel-flow 
drum  mixers  may  be  greater  than  in  other  processes.79 

On  the  other  hand,  because  the  liquid  asphalt  cement,  virgin  aggregate,  and 
RAP  are  mixed  in  a  zone  removed  from  the  exhaust  gas  stream,  counterflow  drum-mix  plants 
will  likely  have  organic  emissions  (gaseous  and  liquid  aerosol)  that  are  lower  than  those  from 
parallel-flow  drum-mix  plants.  A  counterflow  drum-mix  plant  can  normally  process  RAP  at 
ratios  up  to  50  percent  with  little  or  no  observed  effect  on  emissions.  Today's  counterflow 
drum-mix  plants  are  designed  for  improved  thermal  efficiencies.79 

Of  the  3,600  active  hot-mix  asphalt  plants  in  the  United  States,  approximately 
2,300  are  batch-mix  plants,  1,000  are  parallel-flow  drum-mix  plants,  and  300  are  counterflow 
drum-mix  plants.  About  85  percent  of  plants  being  built  today  are  of  the  counterflow 


7-118 


drum-mix  design;  batch-mix  plants  and  parallel-flow  drum-mix  plants  account  for  10  and 
5  percent,  respectively.79 

One  major  advantage  of  both  types  of  drum-mix  plants  is  that  they  can  produce 
material  containing  higher  percentages  of  RAP  than  batch-mix  plants  can  produce.  The  use  of 
RAP  significantly  reduces  the  amount  of  new  (virgin)  rock  and  asphalt  cement  needed  to 
produce  hot-mix  asphalt.  With  the  greater  veiling  of  aggregate,  drum-mix  plants  are  more 
efficient  than  batch-mix  plants  at  transferring  heat  and  achieving  proper  mixing  of  recycled 
asphalt  and  virgin  materials.253 

7.9.2  Benzene  Emissions  from  the  Hot-Mix  Asphalt  Production 

Emissions  of  benzene  from  hot-mix  asphalt  plants  occur  from  the  aggregate 
rotary  dryers  and  the  asphalt  heaters  (due  to  fuel  combustion).  In  Figure  7-26,  the  emission 
point  for  the  rotary  dryer  is  indicated  by  SCC  3-05-002-01,  and  the  emission  pomt  for  the 
heater  is  indicated  by  SCC  3-05-002-06,  -07,  -08,  and  -09.  Note  that  most  of  the  emission 
points  in  Figures  7-26  and  7-27  are  sources  of  paniculate  matter.  Most  plants  employ  some 
form  of  mechanical  collection,  typically  cyclones,  to  collect  aggregate  panicle  emissions  from 
the  rotary  dryers.  However,  these  cyclones  would  have  a  minimal  collection  efficiency  for 
benzene. 

Other  types  of  controls  installed  at  asphalt  hot-mix  plants,  primarily  to  control 
PM  emissions,  include  wet  scrubbers  or  baghouses.253  These  controls  are  expected  to  have 
some  effect  on  reducing  benzene  emissions;  however,  the  control  efficiencies  are  not  known. 

Table  7-15  presents  four  emission  factors  for  the  rotary  dryer  at  a  hot-mix 
asphalt  plant.3,254"263  The  factors  range  from  1.41x10^  lb/ton  (7.04xl0'5  kg/Mg)  to

7. 10  OPEN  BURNING  OF  BIOMASS,  SCRAP  TIRES,  AND  AGRICULTURAL 

PLASTIC  FILM 

Open  burning  involves  the  burning  of  various  materials  in  open  drums  or 
baskets,  in  fields  or  yards,  and  in  large  open  drums  or  pits.  Materials  commonly  disposed  of 
in  this  manner  include  municipal  waste,  auto  body  components,  landscape  refuse,  agricultural 
field  refuse,  wood  refuse,  bulky  industrial  refuse,  and  leaves.  This  section  describes  the  open 
burning  of  biomass,  scrap  tires,  and  agricultural  plastic  film,  and  their  associated  benzene 
emissions. 

7.10.1  Biomass  Burning 

Fires  are  known  to  produce  respirable  PM  and  toxic  substances.  Concern  has 
even  been  voiced  regarding  the  effect  of  emissions  from  biomass  burning  on  climate  change.264 
Burning  wood,  leaves,  and  vegetation  can  be  a  source  of  benzene  emissions.  In  this  document, 
the  burning  of  any  wood,  leaves,  and  vegetation  is  categorized  as  biomass  burning,  and 
includes  yard  waste  burning,  land  clearing/buming  and  slash  burning,  and  forest 
fires/prescribed  burning.265 

Part  of  the  complexity  of  fires  as  a  source  of  emissions  results  from  the  complex 
chemical  composition  of  the  fuel  source.  Different  woods  and  vegetation  are  composed  of 
varying  amounts  of  cellulose,  lignin,  and  extractives  such  as  tannins,  and  other  polyphenolics, 
oils,  fats,  resins,  waxes,  and  starches.266  General  fuel  type  categories  in  the  National  Fire- 
Danger  Rating  (NFDR)  System  include  grasses,  brush,  timber,  and  slash  (residue  that  remains 
on  a  site  after  timber  harvesting).266  The  flammability  of  these  fuel  types  depends  upon  plant 


7-121 


species,  moisture  content,  whether  the  plant  is  alive  or  dead  at  the  time  of  burning,  weather, 
and  seasonal  variations. 

Pollutants  from  the  combustion  of  biomass  include  CO,  NOx,  sulfur  oxides 
(SOx),  oxidants,  polycyclic  organic  matter  (POM),  hydrocarbons,  and  PM.  The  large  number 
of  combustion  products  is  due,  in  part,  to  the  diversity  of  combustion  processes  occurring 
simultaneously  within  a  fire-flaming,  smoldering,  and  glowing  combustion.  These  processes 
are  distinct  combustion  processes  that  involve  different  chemical  reactions  that  affect  when  and 
what  pollutants  will  be  emitted  during  burning.266 

Emission  factor  models  (based  on  field  and  laboratory  data)  have  been 
developed  by  the  U.S.  Forest  Service.  These  models  incorporate  variables  such  as  fuel  type 
and  combustion  types  (flaming  or  smoldering).  Because  ratios  of  toxic  air  substances  are 
correlated  with  the  release  of  other  primary  PICs  (such  as  CO),  the  models  correlate  benzene 
witn  CO  emissions.2"  Tnese  emission  factor  models  were  used  to  develop  emission  factors  for 
the  biomass  burning  sub-categories  described  in  the  following  sections.265 

Because  of  the  potential  variety  in  the  fuel  source  and  the  limited  availability  of 

emission  factors  to  match  all  possible  fuel  sources,  emissions  estimates  may  not  necessarily 

« 

represent  the  combustion  practices  occurrmg  at  every  location  in  the  United  States.  Therefore, 
localized  practices  of  such  parameters  as  type  of  wood  being  burned  and  control  strategies 
should  be  carefully  compared.265 

Yard  Waste  Burning 

Yard  waste  burning  is  the  open  burning  of  such  materials  as  landscape  refuse, 
wood  refuse,  and  leaves  in  urban,  suburban,  and  residential  areas.265  Yard  waste  is  often 
burned  in  open  drums,  piles,  or  baskets  located  in  yards  or  fields.  Ground-level  open  burning 
emissions  are  affected  by  many  variables,  including  wind,  ambient  temperature,  composition 
and  moisture  content  of  the  material  burned,  and  compactness  of  the  pile.  It  should  be  noted 


7-122 


that  this  type  of  outdoor  burning  has  been  banned  in  certain  areas  of  the  United  States,  thereby 
reducing  emissions  from  this  subcategory.265-267  An  emission  factor  for  yard  waste  is  shown  in 
Table  7-16.265-266 

Land  Clearing  and  Slash  Burning 

This  subcategory  includes  the  burning  of  organic  refuse  (field  crops,  wood,  and 
leaves)  in  fields  (agricultural  burning)  and  wooded  areas  (slash  burning)  in  order  to  clear  the 
land.  Burning  as  part  of  commercial  land  clearing  often  requires  a  permit.205  Emissions  from 
organic  agricultural  refuse  burning  are  dependent  primarily  on  the  moisture  content  of  the 
refuse  and,  in  the  case  of  field  crops,  on  whether  the  refuse  is  burned  in  a  headfire  or  a 
backfire.26'  Other  variables,  such  as  fuel  loading  (how  much  refuse  material  is  burned  per  unit 
of  land  area)  and  how  the  refuse  is  arranged  (piles,  rows,  or  spread  out),  are  also  important  in 
certain  instances.267  Emission  factors  for  land  clearing/buming  and  slash  burning  are  shown  in 
Table  7-lb  265-266 

Forest  Fires/Prescribed  Burning 

A  forest  fire  (or  wildfire)  is  a  large-scale  natural  combustion  process  that 
consumes  various  ages,  sizes,  and  types  of  outdoor  vegetation.268  The  size,  intensity,  and  even 
occurrence  of  a  forest  fire  depend  on  such  variables  as  meteorological  conditions,  the  species 
and  moisture  content  of  vegetation  involved,  and  the  weight  of  consumable  fuel  per  acre  (fuel 
loading).268 


Prescribed  or  broadcast  burning  is  the  intentional  burning  of  forest  acres  as  part 
of  forest  management  practices  to  achieve  specific  wildland  management  objectives. 

Controlled  burning  can  be  used  to  reduce  fire  hazard,  encourage  wildlife  habitat,  control 
insects,  and  enhance  the  vigor  of  the  ecosystem.266  Prescribed  burning  occurs  thousands  of 
times  annually  in  the  United  States,  and  individual  fires  vary  in  size  from  a  fraction  of  an  acre

to  several  thousand  acres.  Prescribed  fire  use  is  often  seasonal,  which  can  greatly  affect  the 
quantity  of  emissions  produced.266 

HAP  emission  factors  for  forest  fires  and  prescribed  burning  were  developed 
using  the  same  basic  approach  for  yard  waste  and  land  clearing  burning,  with  an  additional 
step  to  further  classify  fuel  types  into  woody  fuels  (branches,  logs,  stumps,  and  limbs),  live 
vegetation,  and  duff  (layers  of  partially  decomposed  organic  matter).265  In  addition  to  the  fuel 
type,  the  methodology  was  altered  to  account  for  different  phases  of  burning,  namely,  flaming 
and  smoldering.265  The  resulting  emission  factors  are  shown  in  Table  7-17. 

7.10.2  Tire  Burning 

Approximately  240  million  vehicle  tires  are  discarded  annually.269  Although 
viable  methods  for  recycling  exist,  less  than  25  percent  of  discarded  tires  are  recycled;  the 
remammg  175  million  are  discarded  in  landfills,  stockpiles,  or  illegal  dumps.2'""  Although  it  is 
illegal  in  many  states  to  dispose  of  tires  using  open  burning,  fires  often  occur  at  tire  stockpiles 
and  through  illegal  burning  activities.267  These  fires  generate  a  huge  amount  of  heat  and  are 
difficult  to  extinguish  (some  tire  fires  continue  for  months). 

Table  7-18  contains  benzene  emission  factors  for  chunk  tires  and  shredded 
tires.267  When  estimating  emissions  from  an  accidental  tire  fire,  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that 
emissions  from  burning  tires  are  generally  dependent  on  the  bum  rate  of  the  tire.  A  greater 
potential  for  emissions  exists  at  lower  bum  rates,  such  as  when  a  tire  is  smoldering  rather  than 
burning  out  of  control.267  The  fact  that  the  shredded  tires  have  a  lower  bum  rate  indicates  that 
the  gaps  between  tire  materials  provide  the  major  avenue  of  oxygen  transport.  Oxygen 
transport  appears  to  be  a  major,  if  not  the  controlling  mechanism  for  sustaining  the  combustion 
process.

Agricultural  Plastic  Film  Burning 


Agricultural  plastic  film  is  plastic  film  that  has  been  used  for  ground  moisture 
and  weed  control.  The  open  burning  of  large  quantities  of  plastic  film  commonly  coincides 
with  the  burning  of  field  crops.  The  plastic  film  may  also  be  gathered  into  large  piles  and 
burned,  with  or  without  forced  air  (an  air  curtain).267 

Emissions  from  burning  agricultural  plastic  film  are  dependent  on  whether  the 
film  is  new  or  has  been  exposed  to  vegetation  and  possibly  pesticides.  Table  7-19  presents 
emission  factors  for  benzene  emissions  from  burning  new  and  used  plastic  film  in  piles  with 
and  without  forced  air  (i.e.,  air  is  forced  through  the  pile  to  simulate  an  air  curtain).267

SECTION  8.0 

BENZENE  EMISSIONS  FROM  MOBILE  SOURCES 

This  section  quantifies  benzene  as  one  component  of  mobile  source  hydrocarbon 
emissions.  These  emissions  occur  from  mobile  sources  as  evaporative  emissions  from 
carburetors,  fuel  tanks,  and  crankcases,  and  as  a  result  of  combustion. 

Benzene  is  not  added  to  vehicle  fuels  such  as  gasoline  or  diesel,  but  is  formed 
during  their  manufacture,  either  through  catalytic  reforming  or  steam  cracking.  Most  vehicle 
fuel  is  pT‘"'ce?ced  usirg  catalytic  reforming  In  catalytic  reforming,  benzene  is  produced  during 
the  reaction  that  increases  the  octane  rating  of  the  naphtha  fraction  of  the  crude  oil  used  as 
feedstock.  Gasoline  produced  using  this  process  is  approximately  0.90  percent  benzene  (by 
weight).158  (See  Section  4.1  for  an  expanded  discussion  of  catalytic  reforming.) 

The  other  vehicle  fuel  manufacturing  process,  the  use  of  steam  cracking  of 

naphtha  feedstock  to  obtain  ethylene,  yields  gasoline  with  a  higher  benzene  content-20  to 
50  percent.  This  fuel  is  blended  with  other  fuels,  before  it  is  sold,  in  order  to  comply  with  the 
limited  maximum  concentration  of  1.3  percent  (by  volume).  However,  steam  cracking  is 
considered  a  minor  source  of  vehicle  fuel.  (Refer  to  Section  4.3  for  an  expanded  discussion  of 
pyrolysis  gasoline  and  ethylene  plants.) 

Diesel  fuel,  on  the  other  hand,  is  produced  by  hydrocracking  of  the  gas  oil 
fraction  of  crude,  and  contains  relatively  insignificant  amounts  of  benzene. 


8-1 


Benzene  is  emitted  in  vehicle  exhaust  as  unbumed  fuel  and  as  a  product  of 
combustion.  Higher-molecular-weight  aromatics  in  the  fuel,  such  as  ethylbenzene  and  toluene, 
can  be  converted  to  benzene  as  products  of  combustion,  accounting  for  approximately  70  to 
80  percent  of  the  benzene  in  vehicle  exhaust. 

The  fraction  of  benzene  in  the  exhaust  varies  depending  on  vehicle  type,  fuel 
type,  and  control  technology,  but  is  generally  between  3  to  5  percent  by  weight  of  the  exhaust. 
The  fraction  of  benzene  in  the  evaporative  emissions  also  depends  on  control  technology  and 
fuel  composition,  and  is  generally  1  percent  of  a  vehicle's  evaporative  emissions. 

8 . 1  ON-ROAD  MOBILE  SOURCES 


Results  of  recent  work  by  the  Office  of  Mobile  Sources  (OMS)  on  toxic 
emissions  from  on-road  motor  vehicles  are  presented  in  the  1993  report  Motor  Vehicle-Related 

Air  Toxics  Study  (MV ATS). 20  This  report  was  prepared  in  response  to  Section  202 (I)(l)  of  the 

1990  amended  CAA,  which  directs  EPA  to  complete  a  study  of  the  need  for,  and  feasibility  of, 
controlling  emissions  of  toxic  air  pollutants  that  are  unregulated  under  the  Act  and  are 
associated  with  motor  vehicles  and  motor  vehicle  fuels.  The  report  presents  composite 

emission  factors  for  several  toxic  air  pollutants,  including  benzene. 


The  emission  factors  presented  in  the  MV  ATS  were  developed  using  currently 
available  emissions  data  in  a  modified  version  of  the  OMS's  MOBILE4.1  emissions  model 
(designated  MOBTOX)  to  estimate  toxic  emissions  as  a  fraction  of  total  organic  gas  (TOG) 
emissions.  TOG  includes  all  hydrocarbons  as  well  as  aldehydes,  alcohols,  and  other 
oxygenated  compounds.  All  exhaust  mass  fractions  were  calculated  on  a  vehicle-by- vehicle 
basis  for  six  vehicle  types:  light-duty  gasoline  vehicles,  light-duty  gasoline  trucks,  heavy-duty 
gasoline  trucks,  light-duty  diesel  vehicles,  light-duty  diesel  trucks,  and  heavy-duty  diesel 
trucks. 


8-2 


OMS  assumed  that  light-duty  gas  and  diesel  trucks  have  the  same  mass  fractions 
as  light-duty  gas  and  diesel  vehicles,  respectively.  In  developing  mass  fractions  for  light-duty 
gas  vehicles  and  trucks,  four  different  catalytic  controls  and  two  different  fuel  systems 
(carbureted  or  fuel  injection)  were  considered.  Mass  fractions  for  heavy-duty  gas  vehicles 
were  developed  for  carbureted  fuel  systems  with  either  no  emission  controls  or  a  three-way 
catalyst.  These  mass  fractions  were  applied  to  TOG  emission  factors  developed  to  calculate  in- 
use  benzene  emission  factors.  These  in-use  factors  take  into  consideration  evaporative  and 
exhaust  emissions  as  well  as  the  effects  of  vehicle  age. 

A  number  of  important  assumptions  were  made  in  the  development  of  these 
on-road  benzene  emission  factors,  namely: 

1 .  The  increase  in  emissions  due  to  vehicle  deterioration  with  increased 
mileage  is  proportional  to  the  increase  in  TOG; 

2.  Toxics  fractions  remain  constant  with  ambient  temperature  changes;  and 

3 .  The  fractions  are  adequate  to  use  for  the  excess  hydrocarbons  that  come 
from  malfunction  and  tampering/misfueling. 

It  should  be  noted  that,  in  specific  situations,  EPA  mobile  methods  may  over  or  underestimate 
actual  emissions. 

The  benzene  emission  factors  by  vehicle  class  in  grams  of  benzene  emitted  per 
mile  driven  are  shown  in  Table  8-1. 270  The  OMS  also  performed  multiple  runs  of  the 
MOBTOX  program  to  derive  a  pollutant-specific,  composite  emission  factor  that  represented 
all  vehicle  classes,  based  on  the  percent  of  total  vehicle  miles  traveled  (VMT)  attributable  to 
each  vehicle  class.20 

For  traditional  gasoline,  benzene  is  typically  responsible  for  70  to  75  percent  of 
the  aggregated  toxic  emissions.  Most  of  this  is  associated  with  engine  combustion  exhaust.

Oxygenated  fuels  emit  less  benzene  than  traditional  gasoline  mixes  but  more 
than  diesel  fuel.  With  the  introduction  of  alternative  fuels  such  as  methanol  blends, 
compressed  natural  gas  (CNG),  and  liquified  petroleum  gas  (LPG),  formaldehyde  is  the 
dominant  toxic  emission,  accounting  for  80  to  90  percent  of  aggregated  toxic  emissions.272 
Reductions  in  benzene  emissions  associated  with  the  use  of  methanol  fuels  is  dependent  upon 
the  methanol  content  of  the  fuel.  For  instance,  benzene  emissions  for  M 10  (10  percent 
methanol  and  90  percent  unleaded  gasoline)  are  reduced  by  20  percent  compared  with 
traditional  fuel,  and  for  M85  (85  percent  methanol  and  15  percent  unleaded  gasoline)  the 
reduction  is  84  percent  (SAE1992).  Ml 00  (100  percent  methanol),  ethanol,  LPG,  and  CNG 
emit  minimal  amounts  of  benzene.273  Furthermore,  because  both  LPG  and  CNG  require  closed 
delivery  systems,  evaporative  emissions  are  assumed  to  be  zero. 

8.2  OFF-ROAD  MOBILE  SOURCES 

ror  on-roaa  mooile  sources,  EPA  prepared  me  report  Nonroad  Engine 
Vehicle  Emission  Study  (NEVES),274  which  presents  emission  factors  for  79  equipment  types, 
ranging  from  small  equipment  such  as  lawn  mowers  and  chain  saws  to  large  agricultural, 
industrial,  and  construction  machinery  (see  Table  8-2).  The  equipment  types  were  evaluated 
based  on  three  engine  designs:  two-stroke  gasoline,  four-stroke  gasoline,  and  diesel.  Sources 
for  the  data  include  earlier  EPA  studies  and  testing  and  new  information  on  tailpipe  exhaust 
and  crankcase  emissions  supplied  by  the  engine  manufacturers.  For  test  data  on  new  engines, 
OMS  made  adjustments  to  better  represent  in-use  equipment  emissions  taking  into 
consideration  evaporative  emissions  and  increases  in  emissions  due  to  engine  deterioration 
associated  with  increased  equipment  age;  therefore,  new  engine  data  underestimate  in-use 
emissions.274 


Although  these  emission  factors  were  intended  for  calculating  criteria  pollutant 
(VOC,  N02,  CO)  emissions  for  SIP  emissions  inventories,  OMS  derived  emission  factors  for 
several  HAPs,  including  benzene,  so  that  national  air  toxics  emissions  could  be  estimated.  To 
estimate  benzene  emissions,  OMS  expressed  benzene  emissions  as  a  weight  percent  of  exhaust

hydrocarbons  plus  crank  case  hydrocarbons.  In  OMS's  analysis,  it  was  assumed  that  the 
weight  percent  of  benzene  for  all  off-road  sources  was  3  percent  of  exhaust  hydrocarbons.275 
A  range  of  OMS-recommended  weight  percent  benzene  factors  for  general  categories  of 
off-road  equipment  are  presented  in  Table  8-3. 274  Note  that  development  of  equipment-specific 
emission  factors  is  underway,  and  when  available,  those  emission  factors  should  be  considered 
instead.  To  obtain  benzene  emission  estimates  from  equipment  in  these  general  categories  of 
off-road  equipment,  the  benzene  weight  percent  factors  noted  in  Table  8-3  can  be  applied  to 
hydrocarbon  estimates  from  the  different  NEVES  equipment  types. 

The  NEVES  equipment  emission  factors  can  be  used  directly  to  estimate 
emissions  from  specific  equipment  types  if  local  activity  data  is  available.  If  general  nonroad 
emission  estimates  are  required,  States  may  choose  one  of  the  33  nonattainment  areas,  studied 
in  the  NEVES  report,  that  is  similar  in  terms  of  climate  and  economic  activity;  the  NEVES 
nonattainment  area  can  be  adjusted  to  estimate  emissions  in  another  state  by  applying  a 
population  ratio  of  the  two  areas  to  the  NEVES  estimate.  The  NEVES  report  also  has 
estimates  for  individual  counties  of  the  33  nonattainment  areas  such  that  States  or  local 
governments  may  also  produce  regional  or  county  inventories  by  adjusting  the  NEVES  county 
estimates  relative  to  the  population  of  the  different  counties.  Counties  can  be  chosen  from 
several  of  the  33  NEVES  nonattainment  areas  if  appropriate.  For  further  details  on  how  to 
calculate  emissions  from  specific  equipment  types  refer  to  NEVES,  for  details  on  calculating 
emissions  of  nonroad  sources  in  general  see  Reference  271.

For  commercial  marine  vessels,  the  NEVES  report  includes  VOC  emissions  for 
six  nonattainment  areas  taken  from  a  1991  EPA  study  Commercial  Marine  Vessel  Contribution 
to  Emission  Inventories}16  This  study  provided  hydrocarbon  emission  factors  for  ocean-going 
commercial  vessels  and  harbor  and  fishing  vessels.  The  emission  factors  are  shown  in 
Table  8-4.

Ocean-going  marine  vessels  fall  into  one  of  two  categories-those  with  steam 
propulsion  and  those  with  motor  propulsion.  Furthermore,  they  emit  pollution  under  two 
modes  of  operation:  underway  and  at  dockside  (hotelling).  Most  steamships  use  boilers  rather 
than  auxiliary  diesel  engines  while  hotelling.  Currently,  there  are  no  benzene  toxic  emission 
fractions  for  steamship  boiler  burner  emissions.  The  emission  factors  for  motor  propulsion 
systems  are  based  on  emission  fractions  for  heavy-duty  diesel  vehicle  engines.  For  auxiliary 
diesel  generators,  emission  factors  are  available  only  for  500  KW  engines,  since  the  1991 
Booz-Allen  and  Hamilton  report  indicated  that  almost  all  generators  were  rated  at  500  KW  or 
more. 


For  harbor  and  fishing  vessels,  benzene  emission  factors  for  diesel  engines  are 
provided  for  the  following  horsepower  categories  -  less  than  500  hp,  500  to  1,000  hp, 

1,000  to  1,500  hp,  1,500  to  2,000  hp,  and  greater  than  2,000  hp.  In  each  of  these  categories, 
emission  factors  are  developed  for  full,  cruise,  and  slow  operating  modes.  Toxic  emission

1  Benzene  exhaust  emission  factors  were  estimated  by  multiplying  HC  emission  factors  by  benzene  TOG 
fractions.  Benzene  exhaust  emission  fractions  of  HC  for  all  marine  diesel  engines  were  assumed  to  be  the  same 
as  the  TOG  emission  fraction  for  heavy-duty  diesel  vehicles  --  0.0106.  The  benzene  exhaust  emission  fraction 
for  marine  gasoline  engines  was  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  the  exhaust  TOG  emission  fraction  for  heavy  duty 
gasoline  vehicles  -  0.0527.  The  benzene  evaporative  emission  fraction  was  also  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  the 
evaporative  emission  HC  fraction  for  heavy  duty  gasoline  vehicles  --  0.0104. 


8-12 


factors  are  also  provided  for  gasoline  engines  in  this  category.  These  emission  factors  are  not 
broken  down  by  horsepower  rating,  and  are  expressed  in  grams  per.  brake  horsepower  hour 
rather  than  pounds  per  thousand  gallons  of  fuel  consumed. 

8.4  LOCOMOTIVES 

As  noted  in  the  U.S.  EPA's  Procedures  for  Emission  Inventory  Preparation , 
Volume  IV:  Mobile  Sources,271  locomotive  activity  can  be  defined  as  either  line  haul  or  yard 
activities.  Line  haul  locomotives,  which  perform  line  haul  operation,  generally  travel  between 
distant  locations,  such  as  from  one  city  to  another.  Yard  locomotives,  which  perform  yard 
operations,  are  primarily  responsible  for  moving  railcars  within  a  particular  railway  yard. 

The  OMS  has  included  locomotive  emissions  in  its  Motor  Vehicle-Related  Air 
Toxic  Study.20  The  emission  factors  used  for  locomotives  in  this  report  are  derived  from  the 
heavy-duty  diesel  on-road  vehicles  as  there  are  no  emission  factors  specifically  for 
locomotives.  To  derive  toxic  emission  factors  for  heavy  diesel  on-road  vehicles,  hydrocarbon 
emission  factors  were  speciated.  The  emission  factors  provided  in  this  study  (shown  in 
Table  8-5)  are  based  on  g/mile  traveled.20

1  These  fractions  are  found  in  Appendix  B6  of  EPA,  1993,  and  represent  toxic  emission  fractions  for  heavy-duty 
diesel  vehicles.  Toxic  fractions  for  locomotives  are  assumed  to  be  the  same,  since  no  fractions  specific  for 
locomotives  are  available.  It  should  be  noted  that  these  fractions  are  based  on  g/mile  emissions  data,  whereas 
emission  factors  for  locomotives  are  estimated  in  lb/gal.  The  toxic  emission  fractions  were  multiplied  by  the 
HC  emission  factors  to  obtain  the  toxic  emission  factors.

AIRCRAFT 


There  are  two  main  types  of  aircraft  engines  in  use:  turbojet  and  piston.  A 
kerosene-like  jet  fuel  is  used  in  the  jet  engines,  whereas  aviation  gasoline  with  a  lower  vapor 
pressure  than  automotive  gasoline  is  used  for  piston  engines.  The  aircraft  fleet  in  the  United 
States  numbers  about  198,000,  including  civilian  and  military  aircraft.277  Most  of  the  fleet  is 
of  the  single-  and  twin-engine  piston  type  and  is  used  for  general  aviation.  However,  most  of 
the  fuel  is  consumed  by  commercial  jets  and  military  aircraft;  thus,  these  types  of  aircraft 
contribute  more  to  combustion  emissions  than  does  general  aviation.  Most  commercial  jets 
have  two,  three,  or  four  engines.  Military  aircraft  range  from  single  or  dual  jet  engines,  as  in 
fighters,  to  multi-engine  transport  aircraft  with  turbojet  or  turboprop  engines.278 


Despite  the  great  diversity  of  aircraft  types  and  engines,  there  are  considerable 
data  available  to  aid  in  calculating  aircraft-  and  engine-specific  hydrocarbon  emissions,  such  as 

the  database  maintained  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  Office  of  Environment

emission  factors  may  be  used  with  weight  percent  factors  of  benzene  in  hydrocarbon  emissions 
to  estimate  benzene  emissions  from  this  source.  Benzene  weight  percent  factors  in  aircraft 

hydrocarbon  emissions  are  reported  in  an  EPA  memorandum  280  concerning  toxic  emission 
fractions  for  aircraft,  and  are  presented  in  Table  8-6.

Current  guidance  from  EPA  for  estimating  hydrocarbon  emissions  from  aircraft 
appears  in  Procedures  for  Emission  Inventory  Preparation ;  Volume  IV:  Mobile  Sources.271 
The  landing/takeoff  (LTO)  cycle  is  the  basis  for  calculating  aircraft  emissions.  The  operating 
modes  in  an  LTO  cycle  are  (1)  approach,  (2)  taxi/idle  in,  (3)  taxi/idle  out,  (4)  takeoff,  and 
(5)  climbout.  Emission  rates  by  engine  type  and  operating  mode  are  given  in  the  FAEED.  To 
use  this  procedure,  the  aircraft  fleet  must  be  characterized  and  the  duration  of  each  operating 
mode  determined.  From  this  information,  hydrocarbon  emissions  can  be  calculated  for  one 
LTO  for  each  aircraft  type  in  the  fleet.  To  determine  total  hydrocarbon  emissions  from  th? 
fleet,  the  emissions  from  a  single  LTO  for  the  aircraft  type  would  be  multiplied  by  the  number 
of  LTOs  for  each  aircraft  type. 

The  emission  estimation  method  noted  above  is  the  preferred  approach  as  it 
takes  into  consideration  differences  between  new  and  old  aircraft.  If  detailed  aircraft 
information  is  unavailable,  hydrocarbon  emission  indices  for  representative  fleet  mixes  are 
provided  in  the  emissions  inventory  guidance  document  Procedures  for  Emissions  Inventory 
Preparation ;  Volume  IV:  Mobile  Sources.271  The  hydrocarbon  emission  indices  are 
0.394  pounds  per  LTO  (0.179  kg  per  LTO)  for  general  aviation  and  1.234  pounds  per  LTO 
(0.560  kg  per  LTO)  for  air  taxis. 

The  benzene  fraction  of  the  hydrocarbon  total  (in  terms  of  total  organic  gas)  can 
be  estimated  by  using  the  percent  weight  factors  from  Table  8-6.  Because  air  taxis  have  larger 
engines  and  more  of  the  fleet  is  equipped  with  turboprop  and  turbojet  engines  than  is  the 
general  aviation  fleet,  the  percent  weight  factor  is  somewhat  different  from  the  general  aviation 
emission  factor. 

8.6  ROCKET  ENGINES 

Benzene  has  also  been  detected  from  rocket  engines  tested  or  used  for  space 
travel.  Two  types  of  rocket  engines  are  currently  in  use:  sustainer  rocket  engines,  which 
provide  the  main  continual  propulsion,  and  booster  rocket  engines,  which  provide  additional 


8-15 


force  at  critical  stages  of  the  lift  off,  such  as  during  the  separation  of  sections  of  the  rocket 
fuselage. 


Source  testing  of  booster  rocket  engines  using  RP-1  (kerosene)  and  liquid 
oxygen  have  been  completed  at  an  engine  test  site.  Tests  for  benzene  were  taken  for  eight  test 
runs  sampling  at  four  locations  within  the  plume  envelope  below  the  test  stand.  Results  from 
these  tests  yielded  a  range  of  benzene  emission  factors— 0.31  to  0.561  lb/ton  (0.155  to 
0.28°  kg 'Ms)  of  fu?1  combusted— providing  an  average  emission  factor  of  0.431  lb/ton 
(0.215  kg/Mg)  of  fuel  combusted,  as  presented  in  Table  8-7. 282  It  should  be  noted  that  booster 
fuel  consumption  is  approximately  five  times  that  of  sustainer  rocket  engines.

SECTION  9.0 

SOURCE  TEST  PROCEDURES 


Benzene  emissions  from  ambient  air,  mobile  sources,  and  stationary  sources  can 
be  measured  utilizing  the  following  test  methods:283 

•  EPA  Method  0030:  Volatile  Organic  Sampling  Train  (VOST)  with  EPA 

Method  5040/5041:  Analysis  of  Sorbent  Cartridges  from  VOST; 

•  EPA  Method  18:  Measurement  of  Gaseous  Organic  Compound 
Emissions  bv  Gas  ChromatograDhv: 

•  EPA  method  TO-1:  Determination  of  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  in 
Ambient  Air  Using  Tenax®  Adsorption  and  Gas  Chromatography/Mass 
Spectrometry  (GC/MS); 

•  EPA  method  TO-2:  Determination  of  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  in 
Ambient  Air  by  Carbon  Molecular  Sieve  Adsorption  and  Gas 
Chromatography /Mass  Spectrometry; 

•  EPA  Method  TO- 14:  Determination  of  Volatile  Organic  Compounds 
(VOCs)  in  Ambient  Air  Using  SUMMA®  Passivated  Canister  Sampling 
and  Gas  Chromatographic  (GC)  Analysis; 

•  EPA  Exhaust  Gas  Sampling  System,  Federal  Test  Procedure  (FTP);  and 

•  Auto/Oil  Air  Quality  Improvement  Research  (AQERP)  Speciation 
Methodology. 

If  applied  to  stack  sampling,  the  ambient  air  monitoring  methods  may  require 
adaptation  or  modification.  To  ensure  that  results  will  be  quantitative,  appropriate  precautions 
must  be  taken  to  prevent  exceeding  the  capacity  of  the  methodology.  Ambient  methods  that 


9-1 


require  the  use  of  sorbents  are  susceptible  to  sorbent  saturation  if  high  concentration  levels 
exist.  If  this  happens,  breakthrough  will  occur  and  quantitative  analysis  will  not  be  possible. 

9.1  EPA  METHOD  0030284 

The  VOST  from  SW-846  (third  edition)  is  designed  to  collect  VOCs  from  the 
stack  gas  effluents  of  hazardous  waste  incinerators,  but  it  may  be  used  for  a  variety  of 

stationary  sources.  The  VOST  method  was  designed  to  collect  volatile  organics  with  boiling 
points  in  the  range  of  30° C  to  100 °C.  Many  compounds  with  boiling  points  above  100°C  may 
also  be  effectively  collected  using  this  method.  Because  benzene's  boiling  point  is  about 

80. 1  °C,  benzene  concentrations  can  be  measured  using  this  method.  Method  0030  is 
applicable  to  benzene  concentrations  of  10  to  100  or  200  parts  per  billion  by  volume  (ppbv).  If 
the  sample  is  somewhat  above  100  ppbv,  saturation  of  the  instrument  will  occur.  In  those 
cases,  another  method,  such  as  Method  18,  should  be  used.  Method  0030  is  often  used  in 
conjunction  with  analytical  Method  5040/5041. 

Figure  9-1  presents  a  schematic  of  the  principal  components  of  the  VOST.241  In 
most  cases,  20  L  of  effluent  stack  gas  are  sampled  at  an  approximate  flow  rate  of  1  L/min, 
using  a  glass-lined  heated  probe.  The  gas  stream  is  cooled  to  20 °C  by  passage  through  a 
water-cooled  condenser  and  the  volatile  organics  are  collected  on  a  pair  of  sorbent  resin  traps. 
Liquid  condensate  is  collected  in  the  impinger  located  between  the  two  resin  traps.  The  first 
resin  trap  (front  trap)  contains  about  1.6  g  Tenax®  and  the  second  trap  (back  trap)  contains 
about  1  g  each  of  Tenax®  and  petroleum-based  charcoal  (SKC  lot  104  or  equivalent),  3:1  by 
volume. 

The  Tenax®  cartridges  are  then  thermally  desorbed  and  analyzed  by 
purge-and-trap  GC/MS  along  with  the  condensate  catch  as  specified  in  EPA 
Methods  5040/5041.  Analysis  should  be  conducted  within  14  days  of  sample  collection.

The  sensitivity  of  Method  0030  depends  on  the  level  of  interferences  in  the 
sample  and  the  presence  of  detectable  levels  of  benzene  in  the  blanks.  Interferences  arise 
primarily  from  background  contamination  of  sorbent  traps  prior  to  or  after  use  in  sample 
collection.  Many  interferences  are  due  to  exposure  to  significant  concentrations  of  benzene  in 
the  ambient  air  at  the  stationary  source  site  and  exposure  of  the  sorbent  materials  to  solvent 
vapors  prior  to  assembly. 

To  alleviate  these  problems,  the  level  of  the  lab  blank  should  be  determined  in 
advance.  Calculations  should  be  made  based  on  feed  concentration  to  determine  if  blank  level 
will  be  a  significant  problem.  Benzene  should  not  be  chosen  as  a  target  compound  at  very  low 
feed  levels  because  it  is  likely  there  will  be  significant  blank  problems.283 

One  of  the  disadvantages  of  the  VOST  method  is  that  because  the  entire  sample 
is  analyzed,  duplicate  analyses  cannot  be  performed.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  entire 
sample  is  analyzed,  the  sensitivity  is  increased.  Anotner  advantage  is  that  oreakthrough 
volume  is  not  greatly  affected  by  humidity. 

9.2  EPA  METHODS  5040/504 l283-284 

The  contents  of  the  sorbent  cartridges  (collected  using  EPA  Method  0030)  are 
spiked  with  an  internal  standard  and  thermally  desorbed  for  10  minutes  at  80  °C  with 
organic-free  nitrogen  or  helium  gas  (at  a  flow  rate  of  40  mL/min),  bubbled  through  5  mL  of 
organic-free  water,  and  trapped  on  an  analytical  adsorbent  trap.  After  the  10-minute 
desorption,  the  analytical  adsorbent  trap  is  rapidly  heated  to  180°C,  with  the  carrier  gas  flow 
reversed  so  that  the  effluent  flow  from  the  analytical  trap  is  directed  into  the  GC/MS.  The 
volatile  organics  are  separated  by  temperature-programmed  gas  chromatography  and  detected 
by  low-resolution  mass  spectrometry.  The  concentrations  of  the  volatile  compounds  are 
calculated  using  the  internal  standard  technique.  EPA  Methods  5030  and  8420  may  be 
referenced  for  specific  requirements  for  the  thermal  desorption  unit,  purge-and-trap  unit,  and 
GC/MS  system. 


9-4 


A  diagram  of  the  analytical  system  is  presented  in  Figure  9-2.  The  Tenax® 
cartridges  should  be  analyzed  within  14  days  of  collection.  The  detection  limits  for 
low-resolution  MS  using  this  method  are  usually  about  10  to  20  ng  or  1  ng/L  (3  ppbv). 

The  primary  difference  between  EPA  Methods  5040  and  5041  is  the  fact  that 
Method  5041  utilizes  the  wide-bore  capillary  column  (such  as  30  m  DB-624),  whereas 
Method  5040  calls  for  a  stainless  steel  or  glass-packed  column  (1.8  x  0.25  cm  I.D.,  1  percent 

SP'1000  on  ^0/90  rnesb  Carbopack  BV 

9.3  EPA  METHOD  18285 

EPA  Method  18  is  the  preferred  method  for  measuring  higher  levels  of  benzene 
from  a  source  (approximately  1  pan  per  million  by  volume  [ppmv]  to  the  saturation  point  of 
benzene  in  air).  In  Method  18,  a  sample  of  the  exhaust  gas  to  be  analyzed  is  drawn  into  a 
stainless  steel  or  glass  sampling  bulb  or  a  Tedlar®  or  aluminized  Mylar®  bag  as  shown  in 
Figure  9-3. 285  The  Tedlar®  bag  has  been  used  for  some  time  in  the  sampling  and  analysis  of 
source  emissions  for  pollutants.  The  cost  of  the  Tedlar®  bag  is  relatively  low,  and  analysis  by 
gas  chromatography  is  easier  than  with  a  stainless  steel  cylinder  sampler  because  pressurization 
is  not  required  to  extract  the  air  sample  in  the  gas  chromatographic  analysis  process.286  The 
bag  is  placed  inside  a  rigid,  leak-proof  container  and  evacuated.  The  bag  is  then  connected  by 
a  Teflon®  sampling  line  to  a  sampling  probe  (stainless  steel,  Pyrex®  glass,  or  Teflon®)  at  the 
center  of  the  stack.  The  sample  is  drawn  into  the  bag  by  pumping  air  out  of  the  rigid 
container. 


The  sample  is  then  analyzed  by  gas  chromatography  coupled  with  flame 
ionization  detection.  Based  on  field  and  laboratory  validation  studies,  the  recommended  time 
limit  for  analysis  is  within  30  days  of  sample  collection.287  One  recommended  column  is  the 
8-ft  x  1/8  in.  O.D.  stainless  steel  column  packed  with  1  percent  SP-1000  in 
60/80  carbopack  B.  However,  the  GC  operator  should  select  the  column  and  GC  conditions

that  provide  good  resolution  and  minimum  analysis  time  for  benzene.  Zero  helium  or  nitrogen 
should  be  used  as  the  carrier  gas  at  a  flow  rate  that  optimizes  the  resolution. 

The  peak  areas  corresponding  to  the  retention  times  of  benzene  are  measured 
and  compared  to  peak  areas  for  a  set  of  standard  gas  mixtures  to  determine  the  benzene 
concentrations.  The  detection  limit  of  this  method  ranges  from  about  1  ppm  to  an  upper  limit 
governed  by  the  FID  saturation  or  column  overloading.  However,  the  upper  limit  can  be 
extended  by  diluting  the  stack  gases  with  an  inert  gas  or  by  using  smaller  gas  sampling  loops. 


The  EPA's  Atmospheric  Research  and  Exposure  Assessment  Laboratory  has 
produced  a  modified  version  of  Method  18  for  stationary  source  sampling.286,288  One 
difference  from  the  original  method  is  in  the  sampling  rate,  which  is  reduced  to  allow 
collection  of  more  manageable  gas  volumes.  By  reducing  the  gas  volumes,  smaller  Tedlar® 
bags  can  be  used  instead  of  the  traditional  25-L  or  larger  bags,  which  are  not  very  practical  in 
the  field,  especially  when  a  large  number  of  samples  is  required.286  A  second  difference  is  the 
introduction  of  a  filtering  medium  to  remove  entrained  liquids,  which  improves  benzene 
quantitation  precision. 


The  advantage  of  EPA  Method  18  is  that  it  is  rapid  and  relatively  inexpensive. 
However,  it  does  require  a  fully  equipped  chromatography  lab  and  a  skilled  analyst. 

9.4  EPA  METHOD  TO-1  (COMPENDIUM) 


Ambient  air  concentrations  of  benzene  can  be  measured  using  EPA 
Method  TO-1  from  Compendium  of  Methods  for  the  Determination  of  Toxic  Organic 
Compounds  in  Ambient  Air ,289  This  method  is  used  to  collect  and  determine  nonpolar,  volatile 
organics  (aromatic  hydrocarbons,  chlorinated  hydrocarbons)  that  can  be  captured  on  Tenax® 
and  determined  by  thermal  desorption  techniques.  The  compounds  determined  by  this  method 
have  boiling  points  in  the  range  of  80  to  200  °C. 


9-8 


Method  TO-1  can  measure  benzene  concentrations  from  about  3  to  150  ppbv. 
The  advantages  and  disadvantages  are  about  the  same  as  for  the  VOST  method,  and  costs  are 
comparable. 


Figure  9-4  presents  a  block  diagram  of  the  TO-1  system.  Figure  9-5  presents  a 
diagram  of  a  typical  Tenax®  cartridge.289  Ambient  air  is  drawn  through  the  cartridge,  which 
contains  approximately  1  to  2  grams  of  Tenax®.  The  benzene  is  trapped  on  the  Tenax® 
cartridge,  which  is  then  capped  and  sent  to  the  laboratory  for  analysis  utilizing  GC/MS 
according  to  the  procedures  specified  in  EPA  Method  5040. 

The  exact  run  time,  flow  rate,  and  volume  sampled  varies  from  source  to  source 
depending  on  .the  expected  concentrations  and  the  required  detection  limit.  Typically,  10  to 
20  L  of  ambient  air  are  sampled.  Estimated  breakthrough  volume  of  Tenax®  (for  benzene)  is 
19  L/g  at  38°C.  Analysis  should  be  conducted  within  14  days  of  collection.  A  capillary 
column  (tused  silica  SE-30  or  OV-lj  navmg  an  internal  diameter  ot  0.3  mm  and  a  length  oi 
50  m  is  recommended.  The  MS  identifies  and  quantifies  the  compounds  by  mass 
fragmentation  or  ion  characteristic  patterns.  Compound  identification  is  normally 
accomplished  using  a  library  search  routine  on  the  basis  of  GC  retention  time  and  mass 
spectral  characteristics. 

9.5  EPA  METHOD  TO-2283  289 

Method  TO-2  is  used  to  collect  and  determine  highly  volatile,  non-polar 
organics  (vinyl  chloride,  vinylidene  chloride,  benzene,  toluene)  that  can  be  captured  on  a 
carbon  molecular  sieve  (CMS)  trap  and  determined  by  thermal  desorption  techniques.  The 
compounds  to  be  determined  by  this  technique  have  boiling  points  in  the  range  of  15  to  120 °C. 
Method  TO-2  has  the  same  advantages  and  disadvantages  as  the  VOST  method. 

Figure  9-6  presents  a  diagram  of  a  CMS  trap  construction  and  Figure  9-7  shows

containing  0.4  g  of  a  CMS  adsorbent.  The  cartridge  is  analyzed  in  the  laboratory  by  flushing 
with  dry  air  to  remove  adsorbed  moisture  and  purging  the  sample  with  helium  while  heating 
the  cartridge  to  350  to  400  ~'C.  The  desorbed  organics  are  collected  in  a  cryogenic  trap  and 
flash-evaporated  into  a  GC  followed  by  an  MS.  Only  capillar.-  GC  techniques  should  be  used. 
The  GC  temperature  is  increased  through  a  temperature  program  and  the  compounds  are  eluted 
from  the  column  on  the  basis  of  boiling  points.  The  MS  identifies  and  quantifies  the 
compounds  by  mass  fragmentation  patterns.  Compound  identification  is  normally 
accomplished  using  a  library  search  routine  on  the  basis  of  GC  retention  time  and  mass 
spectral  characteristics.  The  most  common  interferences  are  structural  isomers. 

9.6  EPA  METHOD  TO-14283-289 

Ambient  air  concentrations  of  benzene  can  also  be  measured  ’using  EPA 
Method  TO-14  from  Compendium  of  Methods  for  the  Determination  of  Toxic  Organic 
Compounds  in  Amoiem  Air.-  Inis  method  is  oasea  on  collection  of  a  whoie-air  sampie  in 
SUMMA*  passivated  stainless  steel  canisters  and  is  used  to  determine  semivolatile  and  volatile 
organic  compounds. 

This  method  is  applicable  to  specific  semivolatiles  and  VOCs  that  have  been 
tested  and  determined  to  be  stable  when  stored  in  pressurized  and  subatmospheric  pressure 
canisters.  Benzene  has  been  successfully  measured  in  the  parts-per-billion-  by-volume  level 

using  this  method. 

Figure  9-8  presents  a  diagram  of  the  canister  sampling  system.289  Air  is  drawn 
through  a  sampling  train  into  a  p re-evacuated  sample  SUMMA*  canister.  The  canister  is 
attached  to  the  analytical  system.  Water  vapor  is  reduced  in  the  gas  stream  by  a  Nation  dryer 
and  VOCs  are  concentrated  by  collection  into  a  cryogenicallv  cooled  trap.  The  cryogen  is 
removed  and  the  temperature  of  the  sample  raised  to  volatilize  the  sample  into  a 
high-resolution  GC  column.  The  GC  temperature  is  increased  through  a  temperature  program 
and  the  compounds  are  eluted  from  the  column  on  the  basis  of  boiling  points  into  a  detector.

The  choice  of  detector  depends  on  the  specificity  and  sensitivity  required  by  the 
analysis.  Non-specific  detectors  suggested  for  benzene  analysis  include  flame  ionization 
detectors  (FID)  with  detection  limits  of  about  4  ppbv  and  photoionization  detectors  (PID), 
which  are  about  25  times  more  sensitive  than  FID.  Specific-  detectors  include  an  MS  operating 
in  the  selected  ion  mode  or  the  SCAN  mode,  or  an  ion  trap  detector.  Identification  errors  can 
be  reduced  by  employing  simultaneous  detection  by  different  detectors.  The  recommended 
column  for  Method  TO-14  is  an  HP  OV-1  capillary  type  with  0.32  mm  I.D.  and  a  0.88  /xm 
cross-linked  methyl  silicone  coating  or  equivalent.  Samples  should  be  analyzed  within  14  days 
of  collection.  One  of  the  advantages  of  Method  TO-14  is  that  multiple  analyses  can  be 
performed  on  one  sample. 

9.7  .  FEDERAL  TEST  PROCEDURE  (FTP) 

The  most  widely  used  test  procedure  for  sampling  emissions  from  vehicle 
exhaust  is  the  FTP,  which  was  developed  in  1974.290'25-  The  FTP  uses  the  Urban 
Dynamometer  Driving  Schedule  (UDDS),  which  is  1,372  seconds  in  duration.  An  automobile 
is  placed  on  a  chassis  dynamometer,  where  it  is  run  according  to  the  following  schedule: 

505  seconds  of  a  cold  start;  867  seconds  of  hot  transient;  and  505  seconds  of  a  hot  start.  (The 
definitions  of  the  above  terms  can  be  found  in  the  FTP  description  in  the  40  CFR,  Part  86). 290 
The  vehicle  exhaust  is  collected  in  Tedlar®  bags  during  the  three  testing  stages. 

The  most  widely  used  method  for  transporting  vehicle  exhaust  from  the  vehicle 
to  the  bags  is  a  dilution  tube  sampling  arrangement  identical  to  the  system  used  for  measuring 
criteria  pollutants  from  mobile  sources.290,293  Dilution  techniques  are  used  for  sampling  auto 
exhaust  because,  in  theory,  dilution  helps  simulate  the  conditions  under  which  exhaust  gases 
condense  and  react  in  the  atmosphere.  Figure  9-9  shows  a  diagram  of  a  vehicle  exhaust 
sampling  system.290  294  Vehicle  exhausts  are  introduced  at  an  orifice  where  the  gases  are 
collected  and  mixed  with  a  supply  of  filtered  dilution  air.  The  diluted  exhaust  stream  flows  at 
a  measured  velocity  through  the  dilution  tube  and  is  sampled  isokinetically.

The  major  advantage  to  using  a  dilution  tube  approach  is  that  exhaust  gases  are 
allowed  to  react  and  condense  onto  particle  surfaces  prior  to  sample  collection,  providing  a 
truer  composition  of  exhaust  emissions  as  they  occur  in  the  atmosphere.  Another  advantage  is 
that  the  dilution  tube  configuration  allows  simultaneous  monitoring  of  hydrocarbons,  CO,  C02, 
and  NOx.  Back-up  sampling  techniques,  such  as  filtration/adsorption,  are  generally 
recommended  for  collection  of  both  particulate-  and  gas-phase  emissions.292 

9.8  AUTO/OIL  AIR  QUALITY  IMPROVEMENT  RESEARCH  PROGRAM 

SPECIATION  METHOD 

Although  there  is  no  EPA-recommended  analytical  method  for  measuring 
benzene  from  vehicle  exhaust,  the  AQIRP  method  for  the  speciation  of  hydrocarbons  and 
oxygenates  is  widely  used.292,295  Initially,  the  AQIRP  method  included  three  separate  analytical 
approaches  for  analyzing  different  hydrocarbons,  but  Method  3,  the  method  designated  for 
benzene,  was  dropped  from  use  because  of  wandering  retention  times.  Method  2  can  be  used 
to  measure  benzene  from  auto  exhaust  but  some  interferences,  which  will  be  discussed  later, 
may  occur. 


This  analytical  method  calls  for  analyzing  the  bag  samples  collected  by  the  FTP 
method  by  injecting  them  into  a  dual-column  GC  with  an  FID.  A  recommended  pre-column  is 
a  2  m  x  0.32  mm  I.D.  deactivated  fused  silica  (J&W  Scientific  Co.)  connected  to  an  analytical 
column  that  is  60  m  DB-1,  0.32  mm  I.D.,  1  film  thickness.295  The  detection  limit  for 
benzene  with  this  method  is  0.005  ppmC. 

The  peak  areas  corresponding  to  the  retention  times  of  benzene  are  measured 
and  compared  to  peak  areas  for  a  set  of  standard  gas  mixtures  to  determine  the  benzene 
concentrations.  However,  there  is  a  problem  with  benzene  co-eluting  with 
1-methylcyclopentene.  Therefore,  the  analyst  should  be  aware  of  this  potential  interference. 


9-18 


The  amount  of  benzene  in  a  sample  is  obtained  from  the  calibration  curve  in 
units  of  micrograms  per  sample.  Collected  samples  are  sufficiently  stable  to  permit  6  days  of 
ambient  sample  storage  before  analysis.  If  samples  are  refrigerated,  they  are  stable  for 
18  days.
