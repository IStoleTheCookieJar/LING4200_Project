date  on  which  Lessee  commences  its  purchases  hereunder;  and  (c)  if  after  the  primary  term  one  or  more  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  are  capable 
of  producing  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby,  but  such  well  or  wells  are  either  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  such  well  or  wails 
shall  nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying  quantities  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  this  lease.  If  for  a  period  of  90  consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut 
in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall  pay  an  aggregate  shut-in  royalty  of  one  dollar  per  acre  then  covered  by  this  lease,  such  payment  to  be

and  thereafter  on  or  before  each  anniversary  of  the  end  of  said  60-day  period  while  the  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee;  provided 
that  if  this  lease  is  otherwise  being  maintained,  no  shut-in  royalty  shall  be  due  while  there  are  operations  or  production,  as  the  case  may  be,  on  the  leased  premises  or  tends 
pooled  therewith.  Lessee's  failure  to  properly  pay  shut-in  royalty  shall  render  Lessee  liable  for  the  amount  due,  but  shall  not  operate  to  terminate  this  lease. 

5.  Operations.  If,  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessee  drills  a  well  which  is  incapable  of  producing  in  paying  quantifies  (hereinafter  called  "dry  hole")  on  the  leased 
premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  if  alt  production  ceases  from  any  cause,  including  a  revision  of  unit  boundaries  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Paragraph  6  or  the  action 
of  any  governmental  authority,  then  in  the  event  this  lease  is  not  otherwise  being  maintained  in  force  it  shall  nevertheless  remain  in  force  if  Lessee  commences  further 
operations  for  reworking  an  existing  well  or  for  drilling  an  additional  well  or  for  otherwise  obtaining  or  restoring  production  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith 
within  90  days  after  completion  of  operations  on  such  dry  hole  or  within  90  days  after  such  cessation  of  all  production.  If,  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time,  at  the  time  of  ttie 
expiration  of,  or  after  the  primary  term,  this  lease  is  not  otherwise  being  maintained  in  force,  but  Lessee  is  then  engaged  in  drilling,  reworking  or  any  other  operations  to  obtain 
or  restore  production  therefrom,  this  lease  shad  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  one  or  more  of  such  operations  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  90  consecutive 
days,  and  if  any  such  operations  result  in  production  of  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby,  as  long  thereafter  as  mere  is  production  in  paying  quantifies  from  the 
leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  After  completion  of  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  hereunder,  Lessee  shall  drill  such  additional  wells  on  the 
leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  as  a  reasonably  prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances  to  (a)  develop  the  leased  premises  as  to 
formations  then  producing  in  paying  quantities  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  (b)  protect  the  leased  premises  from  uncompensated  drainage  by  any  well 
or  wells  located  on  other  lands  not  pooled  therewith.  There  shall  be  no  covenant  to  drill  exploratory  welts  or  any  additional  wells  except  as  expressly  provided  herein,  ft  is  the 
intent  hereof,  and  it  is  controllingly  so  provided,  that,  should  this  lease  otherwise  terminate,  it  shall  nevertheless  remain  in  full  force  and  effect  as  to  the  governmental  spacing 
or  proration  unit  assigned  to  each  and  every  wall  located  on  the  leased  premises,  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  which  is  then  capable  of  producing  leased  substances  for  so  long 
as  such  well  either  continues  to  be  capable  of  producing  leased  substances  or  other  provisions  of  this  Paragraph  5  are  applicable. 

6.  PootJng.  Lessee  shall  nave  the  right  but  not  the  obligation  to  poo)  alt  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  or  any  interest  therein  with  any  other  lands  or  interests,  as  to  any 
or  all  depths  or  zones,  and  as  to  any  or  all  substances  covered  by  this  lease,  either  before  or  after  the  commencement  of  production,  whenever  Lessee  deems  it  necessary  or 
proper  to  do  so  in  order  to  prudently  develop  or  operate  the  leased  premises,  whether  or  not  similar  pooling  authority  exists  with  respect  to  such  other  lands  or  interests.  The 
unit  formed  by  Such  pooling  for  an  oil  well  (other  than  a  horizontal  completion)  shall  not  exceed  40  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  10%,  and  for  a  gas  well  or  a 
horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  640  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  10%;  provided  that  a  larger  unit  may  be  formed  for  an  oil  well  or  gas  well  or  horizontal 
completion  to  conform  to  any  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  that  may  be  prescribed  or  permitted  by  any  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  to  do  so  or  for  the  purpose 
of  obtaining  a  greater  allowable  rate  of  production  pursuant  to  any  applicable  law  or  regulation.  For  the  purpose  of  the  foregoing,  the  terms  "oil  well"  and  "gas  well"  shall  have 
the  meanings  prescribed  by  applicable  law  or  the  appropriate  governmental  authority,  or,  if  no  definition  is  so  prescribed,  "oii  well"  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil  ratio  of 
(ess  than  100,000  cubic  feet  per  barrel  and  "gas  weir  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil  ratio  of  f 00,000  cubic  feet  or  more  per  barrel,  based  on  a  24-hour  production  test 
conducted  under  normal  producing  conditions  using  standard  tease  separator  facilities  or  equivalent  testing  equipment;  and  the  term  "horizontal  completion"  shall  mean  an  ofl 
well  or  gas  well  in  which  the  horizontal  component  of  the  gross  completion  interval  in  the  reservoir  exceeds  one  hundred  feet  in  length.  In  exercising  its  pooling  rights 
hereunder,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of  pooling.  Production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  or  the 
existence  of  a  well  capable  of  producing  leased  substances  anywhere  on  a  unit  which  includes  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  shall  be  treated  as  if  tt  were  production, 
drilling  or  reworking  operations  or  a  well  capable  of  producing  leased  substances  on  the  leased  premises,  except  that  the  production  on  which  Lessor's  royalty  is  calculated 
shall  be  that  proportion  of  the  total  unit  production  which  the  net  mineral  acreage  covered  by  this  lease  and  included  in  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  gross  acreage  in  the  unit,  but 
only  to  the  extent  such  proportion  of  unit  production  is  sold  by  Lessee.  Pooling  in  one  or  more  instances  shall  not  exhaust  Lessee's  pooling  rights  hereunder,  and  Lessee 
shall,  without  the  joinder  of  Lessor,  have  the  recurring  right  but  not  the  obligation  to  revise  any  unit  formed  hereunder  by  expansion  or  contraction  or  both,  either  before  or  after 
commencement  of  production,  in  order  to  conform  to  the  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  or  acreage  allowable  formula  prescribed  or  permitted  by  the  governmental  authority 
having  jurisdiction,  or  to  conform  to  any  productive  acreage  determination  made  by  such  governmental  authority.  In  making  such  a  revision.  Lessee  shaH  file  of  record  a 
written  declaration  describing  the  revised  unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of  revision.  If  the  relative  acreage  contributions  of  the  tracts  in  the  unit  are  changed  by  virtue  of 
such  revision,  the  proportion  of  unit  production  on  which  royalties  are  payable  hereunder  shall  thereafter  be  adjusted  accordingly.  If  Lessee  deems  it  advisable  in  order  to 
promote  further  development  of  any  part  of  a  unit  area,  or  if  production  from  the  unit  has  ceased.  Lessee  may  terminate  the  unit  by  filing  of  record  a  written  declaration 
describing  the  unit  and  the  effective  date  of  termination  shall  be  the  date  of  filing  unless  provided  otherwise  in  such  declaration.  Pooling  hereunder  shall  not  constitute  a 
cross-conveyance  of  interests. 

7.  Proportionate  Reductions.  If  Lessor  owns  less  than  the  full  mineral  estate  in  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises,  royalties  and  shut-in  royalties  for  any  well  on  any  part 
of  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  shall  be  reduced  to  the  proportion  that  Lessor's  interest  in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises  bears  to  the  full  interest  in  the 
royalties  in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises. 


8.  Ownership  Changes.  The  interest  of  either  Lessor  or  Lessee  hereunder  may  be  assigned,  devised  or  otherwise  transferred  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  area  and/or  by  depth  or 
zone,  and  (he  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  hereunder  shall  extend  to  their  respective  heirs,  devisees,  executors,  administrators,  successors  and  assigns-  No  change  in 
Lessor's  ownership  shall  have  the  effect  of  reducing  the  rights  or  enlarging  the  obligations  of  Lessee  hereunder,  and  no  change  in  ownership  shaH  be  binding  on  Lessee  until 
60  days  after  Lessee  has  been  furnished  the  original  or  duly  authenticated  copies  of  the  documents  establishing  such  change  of  ownership  to  the  satisfaction  of  Lessee.  In 
the  event  of  the  death  of  any  person  entitled  to  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  Lessee  may  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalties  to  the  credit  of  decedent  or  decedent's  estate  in 
the  depository  designated  above,  ff  at  any  time  two  or  more  persons  are  entitled  to  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  Lessee  may  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalties  to  such 
persons  or  to  their  credit  in  the  depository,  either  jointly  or  separately  in  proportion  to  the  interest  which  each  owns  If  Lessee  transfers  its  interest  hereunder  in  whole  or  in 
part,  Lessee  shall  be  relieved  of  all  payments  and  obligations  thereafter  arising  with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest,  and  failure  of  the  transferee  to  satisfy  such  obligations 
with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest  shall  not  affect  the  rights  of  Lessee  with  respect  to  any  interest  not  so  transferred.  If  Lessee  transfers  a  full  or  undivided  interest  in  all  or 
any  portion  of  the  area  covered  by  this  lease,  the  obligation  to  pay  or  lender  shut-in  royalties  hereunder  shall  be  divided  between  Lessee  and  the  transferee  in  proportion  to 
the  net  acreage  interest  in  this  lease  then  betd  by  each. 

9.  Release  of  Lease.  Lessee  may,  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time,  deliver  to  Lessor  or  ffle  of  record  a  written  release  of  this  tease  as  to  full  or  undivided  srrterest  in  aB  or 
any  portion  of  the  area  covered  by  this  lease  or  any  depths  or  zones  thereunder,  and  shall  thereupon  be  relieved  of  aH  obligations  thereafter  arising  with  respect  to  the  interest 
so  released.  If  Lessee  releases  less  than  all  of  the  interest  or  area  covered  hereby,  Lessee's  obligation  to  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  shall  be  proportionately  reduced  in 
accordance  with  the  acreage  interest  retained  hereunder. 

10.  Ancillary  Rights.  In  exploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  marketing  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  covered  hereby  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  or  unitized
