Puckett, 18, confessed to blud¬

Rctiuists fight for organ 
transplants for PUIRs 


by Jeff Getty, ACT UP/ 
Golden Gate Writers Pool 


Alan Hext wants his liver. 


N early one year has passed since the 
University of California announced 
it was moving forward with liver 
and kidney transplants for HIV+ 
patients. Unfortunately, since that announce¬ 
ment UC has performed only one HIV+ liver 
transplant, which the patient’s insurance 
company evidently covered. Although UC of¬ 
ficials refuse to discuss the transplant with the 
public, activists have learned that several qual¬ 
ified HIV+ transplant candidates have been 
turned away, or left on permanent waiting 
lists, due to lack of funding. Many believe UC 
is intentionally dragging its feet. 

At the center of the controversy is Alan 
Hext, an asymptomatic HIV+ patient who 
suffered liver damage from long term He¬ 
patitis C. Hext has been told he is on the cur¬ 


rent wait list at the University of California 
San Francisco (UCSF)Liver Transplant Cen¬ 
ter run by Dr. Nancy Ascher, but that he can¬ 
not receive a new organ because his medical 
insurance, MediCal, has refused to pay for 
hospitalization 

Activists have learned that UC and Medi¬ 
Cal (California’s version of Medicare) have a 
verbal agreement that UC doctors would 
never submit a transplant treatment autho¬ 
rization request (TAR) for any HIV+ patient. 
Earlier this year ACT UP/Golden Gate con¬ 
vinced UC to submit a TAR for Hext only by 
threatening a demonstration. MediCal had 
prompdy turned down the TAR following a 
high-level phone call between UCSF’s Asch¬ 
er and the then-MediCal director, Dr. George 
Wilson. Wilson told activists that Ascher did 
not want MediCal to pay for the transplant 
because it was experimental.

he Castro is about to be livened 
with a splash of public art, thanks 
to former supervisor Wendy 
Nelder, who now heads the 
Mayor’s Neighborhood Beautification 
Fund. 

Earlier this year, Nelder attended a meet¬ 
ing of the Merchants of Upper Market and 
Castro, and told the business proprietors 
there that city money was available for pro¬ 
jects to brighten up neighborhoods. In par¬ 
ticular, she thought Harvey Milk’s legacy 
needed memorializing in the Castro, and 
that a mural would be the thing to do it. 

Soon thereafter, Trevor Hailey, the popu¬ 
lar longtime proprietor of Cruising the Cas¬ 
tro walking tours, and John Downey of PO 
Plus began working to make Nelder’s vision 
a reality. They sought and obtained funding 
from Nelder’s office, then initiated a contest, 
inviting muralists to do mockups for a space 
above the entrance to Milk’s old camera 
shop at 575 Castro. 

The winning design (see painting at left) 
came from Josef Norris, who only recently 
had completed a mural for the new Star- 
bucks in the Safeway complex at Market and 
Church, and who had been a muralist in 
Michigan before moving to the Bay Area. 

Hailey and Downey submitted Norris’s 
design proposal to the neighborhood beau¬ 
tification committee, which promptly ap¬ 
proved it, as did Mayor Brown. 

Norris and his sponsors hope to have the 
artwork completed in time for next week’s 
San Francisco Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Trans- 
gender Pride Parade and celebration. 

While the design itself came from Nor¬ 
ris, the conception came from Nelder, ac¬ 
cording to Hailey. 

“The composition of the mural was 
Wendy’s idea,” said Hailey. “She wanted to 
have Flarvey looking out of his Castro Street 
camera store onto Castro.” 

Hailey welcomes the new mural as one 
of the very few gay monuments in the 
world. 

Best of all, adds Hailey, “it’s preserving 
our history ... and the city’s paying!” T

AOFC outraged by anti¬ 
family Baptist rhetoric 


willingness of so many clergy 
from so many religious traditions 
to support same-gender religious 
marriage contradicts the funda¬ 
mentalists’ claim that America’s 
families should conform to their 
narrow vision or be destroyed.” 

Some Baptists in the city de¬ 
nounced the Southern Baptist 
Convention’s message statement. 
“The Southern Baptist Conven¬ 
tion does not speak for the major¬ 
ity of Baptists on this issue,” said 
the Reverend Doug Donley, pas¬ 
tor of Dolores Street Baptist 
Church in San Francisco, a former 
Southern Baptist church. “ We are 
shocked and horrified by the cli¬ 
mate of exclusivity in the South¬ 
ern Baptist Convention. We at our 
church find the statement passed 
by the convention extremely anti¬ 
family, as well as short-sighted.” 

According to Deaner, an inter¬ 
faith service in support of the re¬ 
ligious and civil freedoms of 
same-sex couples to marry will be 
held at Congregation Sha’ar 
Zahav’s new Dolores Street build¬ 
ing on September 15. Other, more 
civil rights-oriented, actions are 
also being planned, particularly 
around the ethical reluctance of 
many clergy to sign civil marriage 
licenses, which inherently dis¬ 
criminate against same-gender 
couples. 

AOFC also operates the Free¬ 
dom to Marry Project, which pro¬ 
vides services in the north state 
that include community organiz¬ 
ing, information, and advocacy 
on behalf of the civil and human 
rights of queer families. The orga¬ 
nization promotes the education¬ 
al, social, and health-oriented 
concerns of families and individ¬ 
uals whose human and civil rights 
are at risk. ▼

in the country; delegates attend¬ 
ing the annual meeting in Salt 
Lake City, Utah approved the 
statement last week. 

AOFC’s Clergy Caucus is an 
interfaith group working for the 
basic civil and religious rights of 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans¬ 
gender families. Cheryl Deaner, 
AOFC’s executive director, said 
that for the last two months, the 
caucus has been finding ways 'to 
educate the public that God loves 
all marriages and that all mar¬ 
riages are sacred. 

The first action of the caucus 
has been to circulate a petition to 
clergy in Northern California that 
reads: “I have officiated or would 
be willing to officiate at the reli¬ 
gious marriage of a same-gender 
couple.” To date, over 100 clergy 
members have signed the peti¬ 
tion, Deaner said. 

Deaner, who is a lesbian moth¬ 
er, blasted the Southern Baptists’ 
faith statement, saying, “These 
fundamentalist denominational 
leaders are attempting to demean 
and destroy any family that is not 
headed by dominant, heterosexu¬ 
al males. Their willingness to dis¬ 
tort Biblical teachings to justify 
the civil oppression of families 
like mine is both repulsive and 
dangerous.” 

The clergy who have signed 
the AOFC petition represent a va¬ 
riety of denominations, including 
Baptist, Episcopalian, Judaism, 
Lutheran, United Methodist, 
Congregational United Church of 
Christ, Presbyterian, Universal 
Fellowship of Metropolitan Com¬ 
munity Churches, Unitarian Uni- 
versalist, United Church of Christ, 
and the San Francisco Zen Center. 

“All of the clergy were aware 
that their names would be sent to 
the media, and many are aware 
that they were taking stands that 
might put them at serious odds 
with certain elements of their 
faith tradition,” Deaner said. “The

ayor Willie Brown with¬ 
stood pressure from the 
Archdiocese of San Fran¬ 
cisco last year over the landmark 
equal benefits ordinance, and gay 
rights activists are hoping he will 
do so again over the nonprofit ac¬ 
countability or “sunshine” ordi¬ 
nance approved two weeks ago by 
the Board of Supervisors. On Fri¬ 
day, June 12 the mayor met with 
Roman Catholic Archbishop 
William Levada, who has ex¬ 
pressed his desire to see the mayor 
veto the law. 

Catholic Charities, a nonprof¬ 
it affiliate of the archdiocese, 
would fall under provisions of the 
law. Levada objects to the portion 
of the ordinance that calls for 
nonprofit agencies that receive a 
minimum of $250,000 in city-ad¬ 
ministered funds to hold at least 
two open meetings annually. At 
stake may be $5 million in social 
service contracts that Catholic 
Charities holds with the city. 

At his bi-weekly news confer¬ 
ence Tuesday, June 16, Brown said 
he hasn’t decided whether or not 
to sign the ordinance, although he 
did say he hopes something can 
be worked out with the archdio¬ 
cese. The mayor has until Friday, 
June 19 to act on the ordinance; 
he could also let it become law 
without his signature. The mayor 
did say he doesn’t see local gov¬ 
ernment as being “too involved,” 
in the private sector. He also said 
no other nonprofit has lobbied 
him as thoroughly as Catholic 
Charities regarding the ordinance. 

The ordinance, spearheaded 
by Supervisor Tom Ammiano and 
AIDS activists, calls for open 
meetings and disclosure of some 
financial information. It would 
apply to hundreds of nonprofits 


Archbishop William Levada 


in San Francisco that receive pub¬ 
lic funding administered by the 
city. 

While Catholic Charities al¬ 
ready holds open board meetings, 
the archdiocese is apparently 
afraid people might use the open 
meetings under the new ordi¬ 
nance to speak out against the 
Catholic Church. 

The mayor is attempting to 
work something out, but this 
week, he questioned why abortion 
clinics are exempt from the law, 
while Catholic Charities would 
not be exempt. “I’m told abortion 
rights advocates would be exempt 
but critics [of abortion] would 
not be exempt,” said Brown, 
adding he might ask the board to 
reconsider the legislation. 

Ammiano told the B.A.R. that 
comparing the two is like com¬ 
paring apples and oranges. Abor¬ 
tion clinics were exempted be¬ 


cause of bombings, death threats, 
and other violence that have oc¬ 
curred at clinics across the coun¬ 
try, said the supervisor. 

Grievances filed 

Some people, particularly the 
residents of Derek Silva, an AIDS 
housing program operated by 
Catholic Charities, wonder what 
the archdiocese is afraid of if the 
nonprofit accountability law is 
signed by the mayor. The resi¬ 
dents of Derek Silva have filed 
complaints about the facility for 
the past year. They charge 
Catholic Charities has provided 
inadequate heat at the complex, 
has elevators that don’t work 
properly, and that administrators 
retaliate against people who speak 
out or file complaints. 

A petition signed by 30 of the 
approximately 65 residents was 
sent to the HIV Health Services 
Planning Council earlier this year. 
The residents were filing a formal 
grievance concerning living con¬ 
ditions at Derek Silva. During the 
winter months, the program 
manager of the facility allowed 
the heat to be turned on only the 
minimum number of hours re¬ 
quired, despite the cold weather. 
When residents complained, 
Catholic Charities retaliated by 
denying them overnight visitors.

PWA thrown out of 
home after 21 years 

Another owner move-in horror story 


by Cynthia Laird 


} - gay man living with AIDS 
has been served with a no¬ 
tice to move after living in 
his Castro area apartment for 21 
years, setting the stage for a likely 
court battle. The eviction follows 
the failure of Proposition E in the 
June 2 election, and a San Fran¬ 
cisco judge’s overturning of the 
city’s owner move-in moratori¬ 
um, which has led many to fear a 
rash of evictions, of which this 
seems to be a classic example. 

Gregory Gill, who will turn 49 
just days before the July 9 dead¬ 
line, faces displacement from his 
apartment at 3967 18th Street, 
due to an owner move-in eviction 
at the four-unit building. The new 
gay owners, Theodore Armstrong 
and Raymond Dinnocenzio, ini¬ 
tially passed themselves off as 
lovers; at first they said they 
would need only one unit, which 
was vacant after escrow closed on 
the property last month. They 
have changed their tune, however, 
and told Gill they are now “just 
friends” and need two apart¬ 
ments. 

The moratorium on owner 



Gregory Gill 


move-in evictions that was ruled 
unconstitutional by a San Fran¬ 
cisco judge earlier this year has 
not stopped San Francisco Super¬ 
visor Sue Bierman from pushing 
forward to fight for tenants like 
Gill. On Monday, June 15, Bier¬ 
man requested the city attorney 


come up with new language in the 
law that will meet the court’s con¬ 
cerns and still protect tenants. It is 
unknown whether Gill could be 
helped by the redrafted law, as it 
has yet to be completed. 

Before serving Gill with evic¬ 
tion papers, Armstrong had filed 
a notice evicting tenant Elizabeth 
Gelobter on May 29. Gill told the 
Bay Area Reporter that when the 
new owners saw his low $516 
monthly rent, they changed their 
minds and rescinded Gelobter’s 
eviction, setting up a scenario that 
could put Gill in the streets. 

Steve Collier, an attorney with 
the Tenderloin Housing Clinic 
who is representing Gill, told the 
B.A.R. he hopes he can win a 
court case. “Gregory was served 
with a 30-day notice on June 9 
that expires on July 9. If he does¬ 
n’t move, which he won’t, the 
landlord can commence eviction 
proceedings,” said Collier. 

Collier called the action taken 
against Gill by Armstrong and 
Dinnocenzio “disgusting,” but 
thinks he can prevail in court, in 
part because of the rescinded 
Gelobter move-out notice.

SFPD investigates alleged 
anti-gay assault on motorist 


by Mike Salinas 


, ' wo young men in a speeding 
car hurled anti-gay insults 
ll and an item at a man driving 
through rush hour traffic near City 
Hall last week, according to a re¬ 
port filed with San Francisco po¬ 
lice. No one was hurt in the al¬ 
legedly unprovoked assault, al¬ 
though the victim believes the per¬ 
petrator’s actions could have seri¬ 
ously injured himself and others. 

Gary Williams of San Francis¬ 
co told the Bay Area Reporter he 
was driving west on Hayes Street 
with his convertible top down 
Tuesday, June 9 when he heard a 
voice over the din of traffic shout¬ 
ing “Faggot!” He said that he 
turned his head and saw two 
males in their late teens or early 
twenties in a station wagon, star¬ 
ing at him. 

“The passenger threw a small 
object at me - at my face - while I 
was driving,” Williams said. “I had 


to duck down and put my shoul¬ 
der up to avoid getting hit in the 
face, and the thing smacked me 
on the shoulder instead.” 

Although Williams retained 
control of the car he was driving, 
he said, “If the guy had hit me 
where he was aiming, it might 
have caused a wreck.” 

Williams said when he looked 
back at the station wagon, the 
youths were laughing. A motorcy¬ 
clist who had been traveling be¬ 
hind Williams saw what had hap¬ 
pened and caught up to the sta¬ 
tion wagon. “I don’t know what 
he said, but the guys started 
laughing again. Not the motorcy¬ 
clist. He was angry.” 

Williams told the B.A.R. that 
he turned onto Van Ness Avenue 
from Hayes and lost sight of the 
station wagon and the motorcy¬ 
clist. He later found a quarter in 
his car, which he believes may 
have been the object that hit his 
shoulder. 

“Whatever it was,” he said, “it 


really stung, and it could have re¬ 
ally been dangerous, not just to 
me, but to the people around me.” 

Williams reported the crime to 
the San Francisco Police Depart¬ 
ment and Community United 
Against Violence. 

“I don’t think it was road rage,” 
he told the B.A.R. “I’m not aware 
of anything that was happening 
around me that would have set 
anyone off. I don’t know why they 
singled me out. Maybe they saw 
me going into a gay bar or some¬ 
thing once. 

“Whatever their reason, I can’t 
imagine anyone being stupid 
enough to do that while people 
are driving in rush hour traffic.” 

Police are investigating the as¬ 
sault as a possible hate crime. ▼ 


Anyone who witnessed the 
incident, including the 
motorcyclist, should call 
Inspector Bargioni of the hate 
crimes unit at (415) 553-1133.

the city’s police code was referred 
to committee by the full board; no 
date has been scheduled. 

The proposal would amend ar¬ 
ticle 33 of the city’s police code 
that already bans discrimination 
on the basis of race, religion, 
color, ancestry, age, sex, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, dis¬ 
ability, or place of birth in the 
goods and services, facilities and 
privileges, or other advantages a 
business provides. 


Leno to hold campaign 
kick-off Monday 

by Cynthia Laird 

N ewly appointed Supervisor Mark Leno is gearing up for the 
November election when he will face voters for the first time, 
and everyone is invited to attend his campaign kick-off this 
Monday, June 22 at Club Townsend. 

Interested people can also sign up to ride with the openly gay Leno 
in the Pride Parade on Sunday, June 28; he’s number 69 in the parade 
lineup, a fact that had him and others laughing at City Hall this week. 

"I consider myself a Stonewall baby,” Leno said, recalling the 
birth of the modern gay rights movement. “I graduated from high 
school in 1969 and came out in 1969.” 

Leno said that while he will be seeking campaign contributions 
at the upcoming kickoff, he emphasized that everyone is welcome 
to attend, even if they can’t pony up the maximum of $500, or less¬ 
er amounts. 

Leno was appointed to the board by Mayor Willie Brown in 
March and took office in April. He fills the vacancy created when 
former supervisor Susan Leal was elected city treasurer. Openly gay 
Supervisor Tom Ammiano held his re-election kickoff earlier this 
year. There are five seats on the board of supervisors that will be 
up for grabs in the November 3 election. ▼

“This is a logical progression 
in protecting the civil rights of 
persons who provide valuable 
commerce to our city,” Leno said. 
“It demonstrates that we value 
customers who have domestic 
partners just as much as those 
that have spouses.” Six of the su¬ 
pervisors signed on as co-spon¬ 
sors at Monday’s board meeting. 

There are more than 4,000 do¬ 
mestic partners registered with 
the city, including same-sex and 
opposite-sex couples. Leno’s pro¬ 
posal would extend to both types 
of domestic partners. 

At an afternoon news confer¬ 
ence on Monday, Leno cited a cou¬ 
ple of examples: 24 Hour Fitness 
Center and the California State 
Automobile Association (AAA) 
both offer discounts to spouses 
and registered domestic partners. 

A more critical situation, Leno 
said, involves single occupancy, or 
residential hotels that generally 
cater to the poor. Leno’s proposal 
would allow registered domestic 
partners to share living space, 
which is not the case at most of 
them now. 

The amendment would mean 
that businesses that offer a special 
discount, rate, price break, or other 
perk to a customer’s spouse would

Moses supposes 


s'- he Biblical parodies - er, parables - are 
thicker than usual this week, what 
1! with Moses on a rampage and Lott 
denouncing Sodom. 

It started Sunday, when Meet the Press 
played a disturbing videotape of Charlton 
Heston (the creaky old actor who once 
played Moses and then found it impossible 
to shed the character once the cameras 
stopped rolling) addressing the National 
Rifle Association. Heston has long been a 
Hollywood embarrassment - the equivalent 
of the elderly incontinent uncle who ruins 
family reunions by going into his theory 
about why Hitler was “a genius” - but now 
that NRA members have chosen him for 
their leader, it’s worth looking at his beliefs 
in depth. And those beliefs, according to the 
speech he gave to people who are connect¬ 
ed only by their armaments, come danger¬ 
ously close to calling for an open war on 
people who don’t look like him: 

“Mainstream America is depending on 
you, counting on you, to draw your sword 
and fight for them,” he said to all those peo¬ 
ple who lobby for the right to have their 
“swords” automatically loaded with hollow- 
point bullets. “These people have precious 
little time or resources to battle misguided, 
Cinderella attitudes - the fringe propagan¬ 
da of the homosexual coalition, the femi¬ 
nists who preach that it’s a divine duty for 
women to hate men, blacks who raise a mil¬ 
itant fist with one hand, while they seek 
preference with the other.” 

The day after Heston’s xenophobia aired, 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told the 
anchor of a television show that he believed 
homosexuality was both a sin and a disease 
(“like kleptomania”). 

Although Lott has clearly begun to take 
his surname too seriously - making us 
somewhat concerned about the future safe¬ 
ty of Lott’s wife - his outburst does (or 
could) provide an opportunity for the reli¬ 
gions of the world to start really discussing 
the supposed prescriptions against homo¬ 
sexuality, both in the story of Sodom and 
Gomorra and in Leviticus (and, moreover, 
to speak generally about the concept that 
God Is Love, or at least isn’t naked Hatred). 
Now it remains to be seen how many 
churches rise to the occasion. 

There are spiritual leaders who must be 
able to plainly articulate that Leviticus is just 
as condemnatory toward trafe food (that’s 


“non-Kosher” in plain parlance) as it is to¬ 
ward “men lying with men.” In other words, 
if Lott is correct and we are always a sin, so is 
tonight’s special at Red Lobster; so is a cheese¬ 
burger; and so are a lot of other things 
that most people do not consider vi¬ 
olating the Iron Will of God. 

Lott’s supporters include , 

House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, the legislator from Texas 
who called Barney Frank “Barney 
Fag” during a debate on the floor of the 
House. “I abide by the Bible,” Armey 
told reporters, adding that he 
and his wife had read relevant 
sections in the Bible Tuesday 
morning and “I do not quarrel 
with the Bible on this subject.” The key 
being “on this subject.” We’ve yet to see 
Armey picketing a Carl’s Jr. because the 
chain was peddling sinful cheeseburgers to 
an unsuspecting population, and we’re not 
likely to; there’s no attraction in warning 
people against trafe, because it doesn’t rack 
up points with prospective donors - in fact, 
it pisses off many of them. Homosexuality, 
although no different from a ham sandwich 
according to the Bible, is a much more prof¬ 


itable topic for a candidate to take up. 

Or, at least, it was. But that may be get¬ 
ting less true every day. We have to point out 
some encouraging signs: the GOP candi¬ 
dates who goose-stepped to the right all 
through their Iowa debuts left the au¬ 
dience very-much-less-than-im- 
pressed, as Wayne Friday reports on 
page 9; and the most recent survey 
about Americans’ views on homosex¬ 
uality shows that the anti-gay fervor 
has cooled considerably, since its 
height two years ago, as Liz High¬ 
leyman reports on page 22. 

Perhaps the people of this 
country are turning away 
from what most current the¬ 
ologians see clearly as the real sin of 
Sodom: the sin of intolerant xenophobia; 
of demanding that all strangers must be 
“worthy” and “fit in” with everyone else. 
That sin, it would seem, would be much 
more likely than homosexuality to drive a 
loving God into a rage that would end in 
the destruction of a city. Maybe Americans 
are wising up and turning away from the 
sin. Now it’s time for “Moses and compa¬ 
ny” to get the message. T

Letter to someone I believed in 


by Virg Parks 


|p|| ear President Clinton: 

I’m writing this because its the 
mm only appropriate way for me to grieve 
the death of fellow activist Steve Michael. I 
could not afford the trek across country for 
Steve’s funeral and over the last 12 years, 
I’ve attended so many that I vowed “never 
again” (even when the funeral is political). 
Yet, I believe that as humans we need to ac¬ 
knowledge the death of someone we care 
about. We need some sense of closure, even 
when we know the pain will never leave us. 
I’ve not yet mourned the loss of Steve 
Michael, not so much as a candle lit in his 
memory. The cover photo of this week’s Bay 
Area Reporter (a SF gay newspaper) showed 
Steve cold and still in his coffin, and some¬ 
how made his death real in a way that e- 
mail and phone messages had not. In my 
last conversation with Steve’s partner 
Wayne, he told me that articulating our 
grief to you is what Steve would want. Not 
doing so would be the greatest insult to his 
life and death. I knew Steve mostly as an ac¬ 
tivist - and must admit, I didn’t always like 
him. But I respected him. That’s more than 
I can say for you right now. 

However, once upon a time I believed. 
After two presidents who obviously didn’t 
give a damn about AIDS, finally here was a 
candidate who claimed to care and actually 
had a chance at being elected. Finally, here 
was a presidential nominee that I could vote 
for instead of simply voting against the 
greater evil. I remember the night you were 
elected, probably as vividly as you do. I was 


attending an AIDS Clinical Trials Group 
meeting in DC (after absentee voting at 
home, of course). The hotel hosting the 
meeting was also the site of several Democ¬ 
ratic Party parties. That night was so surre¬ 
al. While virtually everyone else in the hotel 
was celebrating, AIDS researchers and 
activists alike were still working away. 

After 10 hours of meetings, my day 
finally ended and all I wanted was a 
drink and bed. Meetings would 
begin again at 8:30 the next morn¬ 
ing. Needless to say, the hotel was 
packed and I could barely get to the 
elevators, much less a bar! 

Fortunately, I ran into a 
friend who told me about 
an impromptu activist 
election night gathering. 

Almost all of the “community” representa¬ 
tives attending the meeting were crammed 
into that room - sitting on beds, floor, 
nightstands - laughing, celebrating, watch¬ 
ing election results. My friend Andy Zysman 
was ecstatic. He was the one who dragged 
me kicking and screaming into believing 
that perhaps (just maybe) a politician might 
provide us some real hope. All the time 
though, I wanted to believe.... I really did. 

Another friend, Brenda Lein of Project 
Inform, wasn’t so easily convinced, though. 
She never believed. When you said the word 
“AIDS” within the first 15 seconds of your 
acceptance speech, the room exploded. Peo¬ 
ple were laughing, hugging, clapping. Andy 
was beside himself, convinced that now 
we’d finally take some real steps forward. I 
leaned over to Brenda and asked, “So now 
do you believe?” She did not. I hate when 


she’s right. 

Andy’s dead now. So are several others 
who were in Mark’s room that night. Even 
though they had much greater access to in¬ 
formation than the average PWA, they still 
died. Even though they fought like mad, 
they still died. Even though they believed in 
you, they still died. If you ever really cared, 
you must be the most depressed, guilt rid¬ 
den, miserable person in this 
country. You made so many 
promises and broke most of 
them - from immigration and 
travel restrictions to unethical 
testing amendments at¬ 
tached to our CARE Act. 
You failed to save lives 
and protect people that 
you could have and 
promised us that you would. Now, you’re 
doing it again by caving into the “Flat Earth 
Society” called Congress. Do you actually 
believe your own rhetoric, that our govern¬ 
ment can support needle exchange in prin¬ 
ciple, yet refuse to spend any money imple¬ 
menting the concept and thereby prevent¬ 
ing needless suffering? 

I hope that you never truly “feel my 
pain” - that of cumulative death, losing so 
many friends and acquaintances that you 
stop counting. I hope that nobody ever 
would feel my pain. At the annual AIDS 
Candlelight Memorial, when participants 
are asked to recall the names of those 
they’ve known before and lost, my list goes 
on and on and on. I’m always certain there 
are some I’ve forgotten, and in silence beg 
their forgiveness. I wonder now if any of us 
can ever forgive you. T

‘Grisly’ bared 

In “Sex change surgeon stumps police” ( B.A.R. 
6/4/98) sex change surgery was referred to as grisly. 
While it certainly does appear that way to nontran¬ 
sexuals, it is viewed much more favorably by trans¬ 
sexuals, despite practitioners such as Dr. Brown. 

Gail Sondegaard 
San Francisco 

[Editor’s note: We didn’t mean to suggest that sex 
change surgery is grisly; the author was specifically re¬ 
ferring to the practice of using a patient’s colon to con¬ 
struct a vagina. We have since learned that the proce¬ 
dure, while hardly common, is more widespread than 
we believed. We apologize unreservedly to Ms. Sonde¬ 
gaard and to anyone else who thought the comment was 
offensive.] 

Less a salvation than an army 

The Salvation Army’s decision to cut back services 
to San Francisco’s needy to protest the city’s domes¬ 
tic partnership policy is nothing less than 
reprehensible. Clearly, the organization is 
more concerned with playing politics, 
than helping the hungry and homeless. I 
may not be a Christian, but I know that 
putting love before the law is the corner¬ 
stone of your religious heritage. 

It’s unfortunate that the Salvation 
Army has chosen a sanctimonious path 
over a compassionate one. I’ll surely 
look elsewhere to make donations in the future, and 
encourage others to do the same.

Instant supe 

On January 8,1998, my best friend Gary Behrens 
died needlessly of a heart attack at 43. Gary’s death 
taught me that life is too short not to do what you 
love; that you can’t take anything with you; and it is 
OK for a man to cry. Three gifts. On my 48th birth¬ 
day, I was arrested by seven San Francisco police offi¬ 
cers for altering the seductive message of a Lucky 
Strike billboard. I was very polite to them, and was 
released with a misdemeanor citation. While I was 
handcuffed, I decided to run for Supervisor, because 
something was wrong when I get arrested for writing 
the truth on a billboard, while the billboard owners 
ignore a new state law, and the tobacco companies 
still get to advertise a drug that contributes to the 
death of 64,000 Californians each year. I have au¬ 
thored an initiative for the November ballot called the 
Outdoor Advertising Control Act of 1998.1 would 
like your support in passing this initiative and getting 
elected Supervisor. I need to get 10,500 valid signa¬ 
tures from registered voters in San Francisco. I need 
to submit these signatures by Monday July 6,1998 to 
qualify for the November ballot. I am looking for 60 
volunteers to collect 200 signatures each. If you or 
anyone that you know would like to see some control 
placed on billboards, please call me. I need volunteers 
Saturday and Sunday June 20 8c 21, 27 & 28 (the 
weekend of the Gay Parade) and July 4 8c 5.1 have 
booked a double booth for the two-day Parade Cele¬ 
bration at Civic Center, will be marching in the Pa¬ 
rade, and hope to get 6,000 signatures that weekend. 

I believe that if we succeed in qualifying this initia¬ 
tive for the November ballot that my chances of get¬ 
ting elected Supervisor will be greatly increased. 

My first act as supervisor will be to investigate why 
Gary was not taken to S.F. General Hospital, four 
blocks from his house, the day of his death. I will then 
author legislation that will never again allow a San 
Francisco resident to be diverted from a city hospital 
when their life is in such jeopardy. 

I will give 90% of my possessions to charity on 
June 15 and dedicate the remainder of my life to the 
service of humanity. When I die, I will have no house 
or car to leave to relatives or friends, but I will have 
left a legacy of service to San Francisco, California, 
and the Earth. 

If you are connected to the Internet, you can visit 
my web site www.SFsupervisor.com. It will be live the 
first week in June. I have published eight white papers 
on issues that are important to me. I would like your 
input on these issues. 

I also inherited Gary’s pickup truck and will have 
the license plate SF Super. 

Four ways you can help me: 

1. Volunteer to gather 200 signatures in your 
neighborhood, or on one of the three weekends be¬ 
fore July 6, 1998. I need 60 volunteers to get 12,000 
signatures. 

2. Make a cash contribution to my campaign or 
the billboard campaign. 

3. Talk to your friends and work associates to find 
those who dislike billboards, and ask to volunteer to 
collect signatures and/or contribute to the campaign. 

4. March with me in the parade, Sunday June 28, 
1998 at 11 am.

Thanks all around 

I want to thank ACT UP/San Francisco for letting 
us know that Dan Glazer, owner of the Hot Cookie, 
conceived the “Create Change” posters that adorn 
shop windows in the Castro. We strongly support Mr. 
Glazer’s actions, and have now started frequenting his 
business to show our support for his actions. We en¬ 
courage other merchants to work with Mr. Glazer to 
publicize ways in which citizens can provide real help 
to the homeless in this neighborhood. Thank you, 
Mr. Glazer, for acting in a responsible manner to help 
the homeless and to help clean up the Castro.

The decline and fall of the Castro 

This is in response to the letter by Michael Bell- 
fountaine of ACT UP/San Francisco, in the B.A.R. of 
June 4, 1998: “Protesters confront Castro merchant 
on panhandling issue.” With all respect to ACT 

UP/San Francisco, an organization I supported 
with a few contributions, I differ with him on 
handing out the money of its supporters 
f to the homeless in the Castro, and con¬ 
fronting the Merchants of Upper Market 
and Castro (MUMC). 

Donors such as myself make contri¬ 
butions to ACT UP/San Francisco to 
further accelerate the cure for AIDS, 
not for handouts to panhandlers, which 
we are adequately capable of doing our¬ 
selves. If we are not careful panhandlers are likely to 
drive out one of the economic engines of Castro: gay 
guys cruising - who, by the way, support Castro-based 
business. As a gay community, we need to support 
each other, however, we should not fall into the trap 
of providing support to the homeless, which the city 
authorities blithely ignore. If people find other neigh¬ 
borhoods to take their business to, merchants will 
suffer, potentially leading to the decline of the Castro. 

Dr. Massimo A. Saluzzo

Personal attacks 

I find myself as confused as I am dismayed by the 
attack on Reverend Jim Mitulski that appeared in the 
Politics column June 11. Is it now considered an insult 
for a clergyperson to be compared to Reverend Cecil 
Williams? Most religious people I know admire 
Williams. Is it supposed to he a problem that Rev¬ 
erend Mitulski is “happy” when hungry and home¬ 
less people are being fed? What’s he supposed to be? 
Unhappy? If I read my Bible correctly, taking care of 
the hungry is a spiritual act. 

I think that if some people don’t want to give 
change to street panhandlers because they fear it will 
go to drugs, then the MCC food program is a very 
worthy alternative. I urge such people to walk over to 
the Church and get involved in solving the problem 
rather than stigmatizing the victims.

Word up 

Re: In Defense of Queer, Jesse Heiwa’s letter [Mail- 
strom, June 11] where he objects to being discour¬ 
aged from using the term “queer,” which he states was 
“ reclaimed by our communities in the early ’90s.” 

Well, to recall something seems to suggest that 
something was inherently yours and somehow you 
lost it. I have been what has been called a “practicing 
homosexual” (practice makes perfect - maybe some¬ 
day) for about 50 years and that despised term cer¬ 
tainly never belonged to me, though it was a word 
that others tried to label me with. 

I remember in school being poked and pushed, 
with that word being muttered at me, usually fol¬ 
lowed by a snicker. I remember at 17, coming home 
late from a party and being surrounded by five big 
guys who knocked me to the ground and proceeded 
to punch and kick me, the whole time calling me a 
“God damn queer,”“Queer bastard,”“Fuckin’ queer”- 
you get the picture. Not once during this session of 
pain and humiliation did I think, “Damn, it’s bad 
enough that they beat me, but they’ve stolen my word.” 

Heiwa talks about the variations within the com¬ 
munity and suggests that the word “gay” is too limit¬ 
ing (I always thought it was too frivolous to describe 
most of my life) and therefore we should amass these 
diversities under one word and that word should be 
queer. I wonder if he ever looked up the word in a 
thesaurus. The paperback edition lists 45 definitions 
under “queer” as an adjective, most of them negative. 

It has two listed as a noun: “derogatory term for a ho¬ 
mosexual,” and “counterfeit.” How acceptable is that? 

I just can’t imagine Harvey Milk proclaiming him¬ 
self a queer because he knew the word for what it is - 
a hate word. And to paraphrase another homosexual 
icon: “A hate word is a hate word, is a hate word.”

Hard Copy addresses 
Pat Robertson’s 
anti-gay rhetoric 


by Don Romesburg, 
GLAAD/SF media 
resource center manager 

, n June 10, Hard Copy's lead 
story focused on comments 
11 made by religious political 
extremist Pat Robertson on the 
June 8 episode of his evangelical 
television show, The 700 Club. Re¬ 
sponding to pride-related activities 
in Orlando, Florida, including the 
unofficial Gay Days at Disney 
World, Robertson said: “I would 
warn Orlando that you’re right 
in the way of some serious 
hurricanes, and I don’t 
think I’d be waving 
those flags in God’s face 
if I were you.” He con¬ 
tinued, “This is not a 
message of hate; this is 
a message of redemp¬ 
tion. But a condition 
like this will bring 
about the destruction of 
your nation. It’ll bring about ter¬ 
rorist bombs; it’ll bring earth¬ 
quakes, tornadoes and possibly a 
meteor.” In their daily “Top Copy” 
segment, Hard Copy criticized the 
“Almighty, self-proclaimed 
spokesperson Pat Robertson,” be¬ 
ginning the piece by saying that 
“Pat Robertson is issuing some 
outrageous warnings about God’s 
wrath against gays tonight. Some 
say the TV evangelist is taking ho¬ 
mophobia to new heights,” and 
ending by noting that: “The Chris¬ 
tian Crusader has made a fortune 
spreading the word of God. Let’s 
see now, how does it go? On the 
eighth day, Preacher Pat created in¬ 
tolerance.” Included in Hard Copy’s 
piece was a snippet of an interview 
conducted with GLAAD Director 
of Communications Jennifer Ein- 
horn, in which she urged Robert¬ 
son to reevaluate the tone and di¬ 
rection of his remarks, which 
demonstrate precisely how to 
build a climate of intolerance. 

In September of last year, 
GLAAD met with the producers 
of Hard Copy to voice its concerns 
with the tone of the show’s re¬ 
porting on lesbian- and gay- 
themed issues [see GLAADAlerts 
07.18.97 and 08.29.97]. Since 
then, Hard Copy ran two much- 
improved pieces [see 
GLAADAlert 09.26.97] in addi¬ 
tion to this recent and promi¬ 
nently featured segment, which 
clearly illustrates the nature of 
Robertson’s destructive rhetoric. 
GLAAD Executive Director Joan 
M. Garry said, “GLAAD is proud 
of the work we’ve done with Hard 
Copy , and we thank them for their 
increasing sensitivity to the issues 
which face our community.” 

Please thank the producers of 
Hard Copy for their prompt and 
prominent attention to this mat¬ 
ter, and for bringing to light the 
true nature of Robertson’s state¬ 
ments.

Detour features 
Heche in depth 

A cover story on actress Anne 
Heche in the June/July issue of De¬ 



tour directly addresses the increas¬ 
ing media hype surrounding an 
openly gay actress playing a het¬ 
erosexual romantic lead in Six 
Days, Seven Nights. Dale Brasel’s 
piece, entitled “Heche Crimes,” be¬ 
gins with Heche venting her frus¬ 
tration with the responses received 
from both gay and straight indi¬ 
viduals after coming out last year 
under the glare of the media spot¬ 
light. “Everyone feared the movie 
wasn’t going to do well because 
I’m gay. Everybody-every- 
body in the industry hated 
me and wouldn’t come near 
me - except basically for 
[Six Days co-star] Har¬ 
rison Ford and [direc¬ 
tor] Ivan Reitman, who 
were brilliant,” Heche 
tells writer Dale Brasel. 
Brasel, who last inter¬ 
viewed Heche nine 
days before she met 
DeGeneres, writes of 
the couple’s genuine af¬ 
fection for one another, saying: “If 
this is a performance, they both 
deserve Oscars.” Brasel also points 
out that soon after completing Six 
Days, Heche “fully expected to be 
benched from acting until the 
public expressed its approval or 
disapproval of her life in the form 
of box-office receipts. Surprising¬ 
ly, an offer came rather quickly for 
Force Majeure, opposite Vince 
Vaughn.” 

While the media has contin¬ 
ued to frame Heche’s perfor¬ 
mance as a litmus test for audi¬ 
ence acceptance of openly lesbian 
and gay movie stars in straight 
roles, GLAAD anticipates that au¬ 
diences will judge the movie 
based on its merits. 

Please thank Detour for doing 
a good job of cutting through the 
hype.

New York Times 
explores second 
generation gay kids 

The June 7 New York Times 
featured an article by David 
Kirby, entitled “The Second Gen¬ 
eration,” exploring families that 
include two generations of les¬ 
bians or gay men. While on the 
surface it may seem that coming 
out to a lesbian or gay parent 


would pose no problem, Kirby’s 
interviews provide varied re¬ 
sponses from lesbian and gay 
youth and their gay parents. One 
lesbian mother tells him that her 
son’s coming out “kind of scared 
me because ... I don’t want my 
kids to have to go through all the 
pain,” while another says, “What¬ 
ever they turned out [to be] 
would’ve been fine with us: both 
gay, both straight or any combi¬ 
nation.” Kirby adds that while 
“Sometimes [lesbian and gay par¬ 
ents] are swept into the political 
and scientific debate over 
whether homosexuals are born or 
made, and whether parents influ¬ 
ence their children’s sexual orien¬ 
tation,” all of the lesbian and gay 
children in the article agree that 
their parents’ sexual orientation 
did not influence their own. As an 
example, Kirby points to the case 
of Maria De la O, who realized 
she was bisexual even before her 
mother had come out. Jamie 
Egan, a second generation gay 
person notes, “To say gay people 
make people gay is a ridiculous 
cliche.” Still, Kirby also takes into 
account the fears of a number of 
other lesbians and gay men who 
worry that being outspoken 
about a lesbian or gay second 
generation person will “propagate 
stereotypes [of] gay people re¬ 
cruiting kids.” 

Kirby explores the issues that 
both first and second generations 
of lesbians and gay men face in a 
particularly insightful and 
thoughtful manner. 

Please thank the New York 
Times for this perceptive and en¬ 
gaging story on second genera¬ 
tion lesbians and gay men.

Black eye for 
the Hawkeyes 



Castro Cheesery Owner Ken Khoury (right) speaks with Supervisors 
Leslie Katz and Gavin Newsom during their June 11 "walkabout" on 
Castro Street. Castro merchants and residents were concerned about the 
urban ills of the '90s: homelessness, panhandling, trash and chain stores. 


by Wayne Friday 


f the national Republican Party 
thinks that the current scan- 
ii dais swirling around President 
Bill Clinton make their regaining 
the White House in 2000 a rare 
thing, they have only to examine 
last weekend’s Iowa Republican 
soiree to get an idea as to the 
problems they face in such a bid. 
Iowa, traditionally one of the very 
first battlegrounds of any presi¬ 
dential run for the roses, threw a 
party confab for 2,000 that was 
designed to showcase nearly a 
dozen prospective Republican 
presidential hopefuls and present 
the GOP’s “ideas and visions” for 
the next millennium. 

However, Democratic leaders 
watching the gathering in Cedar 
Rapids had to be sporting huge 
Cheshire grins as they saw the so- 
called “gala” degenerate into an 
intraparty contest to show who 
could be the most conservative 
suck-up possible. Big-name 
potential candidates like 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
Governor George W. 

Bush and Senator John 
McCain wisely steered 
clear of the debacle. 

Even so, no less than 
a dozen presidential 
wannabes 
(Representa¬ 
tive John Ka- 
sich, Family 
Research Council’s Gary Bauer, 
publisher Steve Forbes, African- 
American radio talk show host 
Alan Keyes, Senator John 
Ashcroft, former Governor 
Lamar Alexander, Senator Bob 
Smith, Representative Bob Barr, 
Marilyn Quayle (filling in for 
hubby), Governor Mark Racicot, 
etc.) appeared in an attempt to 
“out-right” the other. 

First up was Bauer, the notori¬ 
ously homophobic president of 
the Family Research Council, who 
galvanized the assembled 
Hawkeyes by appearing with 
Green Bay Packers star Reggie 
White . Mr. White, you may recall, 
recently informed the Wisconsin 
State Assembly that blacks (he’s 
African-American) “like to sing 
and dance” and “whites know 
how to tap into money.” He re¬ 
ferred to homosexuality as “one of 
the biggest sins” of the Bible. (No 
word on whether or not he be¬ 
lieves wives should submit them¬ 
selves graciously to their hus¬ 
bands.) 

Bauer, who almost reaches 
White’s shoulder, stood on stage 
next to this arbiter of morals and 
proclaimed, “I stood with Reggie 
White. No to same-sex marriages! 
No to saying that way of life is ac¬ 
ceptable!” White simply reiterated 
that “I said what I meant, and I 
meant what I said,” even though 
most Wisconsin legislators swore 
they had no idea what he was 
foaming at the mouth about. 

Not to be outdone, Forbes, son 
of the late Malcolm Forbes - a 
man reportedly devoted to mo¬ 
torcycles and leather and the men 
who go with them - improved his 
conservative credentials by palling 
around with that illustrious ho¬ 
mophobe, the Reverend Lou 
Sheldon, chairman of the Tradi¬ 
tional Values Coalition. Forbes 
made sure that they’ll never stick 
him with that “moderate” label 
again. 

Each of the GOP hopefuls 


were given 11 minutes on center 
stage to make their pitch. One 
after the other, they went to great 
lengths to demonstrate that they 
were really even more conserva¬ 
tive, more moral, than the previ¬ 
ous speaker. Their higher ground 
was the real deal. 

But how did all this play with 
the actual attendees? Many ven¬ 
tured the opinion that it 
was all perhaps a trifle 
over the top. “It’s a little 
bit scary,” Ron Ras¬ 
mussen told the As¬ 
sociated Press. The 
small business owner 
said he would have pre¬ 
ferred the speakers stick 
to issues like 
“states rights, 
citizens rights, 
and getting 
taxes reduced.” But you can bet 
your bottom dollar that others, 
like Vice President Al Gore, for 
instance, were tickled pink with 
the overheated, hateful rhetoric 
spewed by the GOP in the Mid¬ 
west this past weekend. They can 
only look good by comparison. 

The Jer is there 

Oakland’s mayor-elect Jerry 
Brown, wildly popular with the 
citizens of his new home town, 
has truly re-emerged as a bona 
fide national media star. Busy 
shedding his Governor Moon¬ 
beam image, the articulate Brown 
has been guesting on national TV 
news shows by the dozen, putting 
our East Bay neighbor on the map 
big time. In fact, his media-sawy 
performances have clearly over¬ 
shadowed the antics of that other 
Bay Area Brown: Willie. 

Gertrude Stein's famous line 
reputedly about Oakland: 
“There’s no there there” may still 
hold true, but there’s now a Jer 
there and everyone has taken 
note. Jerry Brown, a native San 
Franciscan who once adopted LA 
as his home town, moved back to 
our city for a few years, but then 
relocated to Oakland four years 
ago “because the rent was cheap¬ 
er.” 

The millionaire Brown has 
stated that “Oakland is small 
enough for the people to take 
control, but big enough to make a 
difference. On my mind is putting 
cities back on the national agen¬ 
da.” Hmm, he sounds like a man 
interested in politics beyond the 
confines of Oaktown to me! 

President Clinton reportedly 
raised $2 million for Senator Bar¬ 
bara Boxer and the Democrats 
during stops here and in LA this 
past weekend. Among the Holly¬ 
wood luminaries attending a re¬ 
ception for Boxer in Beverly Hills 
were Barbra Streisand, James 
Brolin, Rod McKuen, Sally 
Field, Tina Sinatra, Quincy 


Jones, Sidney Poitier, David 
Geffen, and Senator Dianne Fe- 
instein. 

Meanwhile, Boxer’s opponent, 
GOP state Treasurer Matt Fong, 
is reportedly broke. He’s said to be 
looking to the national party in 
D.C. for help. Maybe NRA Prez 
Chuck Heston (with Tony 
Danza and Bruce Willis and 
Demi Moore) will do a Fong 
fundraiser soon! 

Former Vice President Dan 
Quayle, now a full-fledged GOP 
presidential candidate, has boldly 
predicted that “any Republican 
can beat Bill Clinton in 2000.” 
Well , Danny is right there, consid¬ 
ering that Clinton can’t even run 
in 2000. As for his own chances, 
Quayle told one audience recent¬ 
ly that “if I don’t win the presi¬ 
dency in 2000, I’ll run and win 
four years later in 6000.” (And 
how do you spell “potato,” Dan?) 

The Log Cabin Republicans of 
Texas held a rally June 13 outside 
the state GOP convention in Fort 
Worth to protest the party’s deci¬ 
sion to deny their group an infor¬ 
mation booth inside. Wake up 
and smell the coffee, guys! 

Meanwhile, those in the know 
are crowing that the 2000 Nation¬ 
al GOP Convention is all sqt for 
New York City, thanks to the ef¬ 
forts of popular Republican Mayor 
Rudy Giuliani of that burg. 

Local gay activist/attorney 
Victor Marquez, a recent winner 
of a seat on the County Demo 
Committee, is said to be ready to 
announce for the Board of Supes. 

Highly placed political opera¬ 
tives in the Gray Davis for Gov¬ 
ernor camp are anxious to get 
their candidate to sit down and 
smoke the peace pipe with — you 
guessed it — Dianne Feinstein. 
The senator is said to still be high¬ 
ly pissed at Davis for those infa¬ 
mous Leona Helmsley TV ads 
that he pounded her with in 1992. 
Feinstein’s support is seen as a 
must for a Davis victory; however, 
DiFi, though a party loyalist, is 
not one to forgive and forget so 
easily. Even so, she certainly does¬ 
n’t want Dan Lungren to become 
our next governor. Perhaps more 
importantly, many think that Fe¬ 
instein is a likely VP choice for Al 
Gore on a national ticket in two 
years, and a Democratic governor, 
especially one she helped elect, in 
the nation’s most populous state 
is crucial to the duo’s chances of 
setting up residence at 1600 Penn¬ 
sylvania Avenue. 

Friends and supporters of new 
Supervisor Mark Leno are hold¬

ft I ote Early and Often Dept.: 

So, was the open primary 
* W good for you, too? I took it 
rather literally, spreading votes 
across spectrum by voting for 
candidates’ positions, not their 
party affiliations. Democrat, Re¬ 
publican, Libertarian, Reform, 
Green ... I voted for candidates of 
every party, but Natural Law and 
American Independent. I wish we 
could have had a runoff instead 
of an automatic result of Mayor 
Moonbeam, but such is life; I’ll 
just hope Jerry Brown does a 
good job. Does Jerry really know 
Oakland? Talk of crafts-based al¬ 
ternatives to current waterfront 
uses raises my doubts; the Port of 
Oakland is a major employer in a 
city that needs even more jobs. 

Meanwhile, I nearly got 
whiplash watching some folks do 
fast 180s on the concept of the 
will of the people, as expressed at 
the ballot box. First, people de¬ 
manded the government honor 
the democratic verdict in favor of 
medical marijuana. Then, some 
of the same people set up a cry 
demanding that schools ignore 
the democratic verdict in favor of 
supplanting bilingual education 
with English immersion. Some¬ 
how, I think a lot of the people 
who constantly talk about 
democracy don’t really believe in 
it. I think to them, democracy 
means getting their way; they as¬ 
sume they alone represent “the 
people,” and are flabbergasted 
when the people vote contrary to 
their slogans. 

One cause of this seems to be 
people who idealize California as 
a liberal paradise, coming to be¬ 
lieve they somehow have a pro¬ 
prietary interest in California; 
they get so shocked when Califor¬ 
nians think independently. I 
heard someone say, “If Dan Lun- 
gren gets elected governor, Cali¬ 
fornia’s over!” I’m not thrilled by 
the prospect of a Governor Lun- 
gren myself. But, as a Californian, 
I find the idea that California 
would be “over” in such an event 
to be ludicrous. Even as governor, 
Dan Lungren would be powerless 
to stop people from living the “al¬ 
ternative” lifestyles for which Cal¬ 
ifornia is notable. He might be 
able to end people having their 
alternative lifestyles subsidized 
with other people’s tax money; 
that would be a tragedy for pro¬ 
fessional entitlement queens, but 
good for the rest of us. Those of 
us who created alternative 
lifestyles in California did so

without government assistance, 
and we can do it again. 

As a matter of fact, I can’t help 
but think that all these calls for 
government to support lifestyles 
and cultures could backfire in a 
very interesting way. I can totally 
imagine, within the next, say, 15 
years or so, serious calls for 
Northern Californian secession 
from the Union. Not from liber¬ 
als and the multiculturalism 
crowd, oh no - these calls would 
come from the Californians 
who have become tired of 
being asked to finance the 
social re-engineering of 
their own community and 
culture. The ones some 
people don’t realize 
they’re insulting 
when they say it’s the 
variegated popula¬ 
tion of new¬ 
comers that’s 
made Califor¬ 
nia interest¬ 
ing and wonderful, so the boring 
old locals should just shut up and 
subsidize not only the newcom¬ 
ers’ entry, but their home cultures 
and baseline prosperity. In other 
words, the people whose votes 
have carried all those elections on 
which San Francisco voters came 
out on the losing side. 

When you think about it, what 
would the neo-Californios have 
to lose? Certainly not its differ¬ 
ence from mainstream America. 
Life in California has been differ¬ 
ent from life back east from the 
first influx of Iron Age people. 

L caught some folks debating 
recently whether California is 
part of the U.S. or part of Mexico, 
and was tempted to point out it’s 
never really been either. The mis¬ 
sions were Spanish, and didn’t get 
along with Mexican authorities. 
Little love was lost between the 
Mexican government (so far away 
by horseback or ship) and the 
Spanish Dons, who thought of 
themselves not as “Mexicanos” 
but as “Californios.” Californio

culture was different from Mexi¬ 
can culture; it can be argued that 
it was the hybrid culture that 
emerged from the mixing of na¬ 
tive, Spanish, Yankee, and 
Mediterranean that made Cali¬ 
fornia attractive for more than 
just climate. 

Even the Gold Rush, for all its 
excesses, was a critical positive 
event in California culture. Cul¬ 
ture is comprised of more than 
arts, customs, and spirituality: it 
also includes trade and 
commerce styles, as well 
as orientation toward 
work and productivity in 
general. The people who set¬ 
tled the territory and state 
of California did not 
move here and take 
jobs; they created busi¬ 
nesses and jobs. As a 
matter of fact, 
with so many 
miners dying 
in the gold 
fields, the California culture was 
one in which women were more 
often entrepreneurs than house¬ 
wives (unlike back east or in 
other countries). Whether cook¬ 
ing, teaching, running boarding 
houses, taking in laundry, or 
doing sex or entertainment work, 
women were businesswomen ... 
and this set expectations for 
women’s options that have lasted 
to this day. 

What people would lose 
would be the politically correct 
crowd, so fearful that California 
will be “over” if the region doesn’t 
have a government based on in¬ 
come redistribution and subsi¬ 
dizing “cultures” that take all the 
advances of Western Civilization 
for granted, while branding it as 
evil. This is disincentive? 

So go ahead and vow to ignore 
the voters in the name of univer¬ 
sal government subsidy. Wake 
that sleeping giant. And please, 
Br’er Transplant, whatever you 
do, don’t throw me in that inde¬ 
pendent Alta California patch! T

Gelobter confirmed that her evic¬ 
tion notice has been canceled by 
Armstrong. 

Under owner move-in regula¬ 
tions, Armstrong, who signed the 
notice, “seeks in good faith...” to 
occupy Gill’s unit “as the princi¬ 
pal residence.” Records from the 
San Francisco Assessor’s Office 
show that Armstrong owns an¬ 
other piece of property, and that 
the tax bill is currently sent to an 
address on 21st Street. 

“They saw my [rent] check was 
half of another tenant’s,” said Gill. 
“They know I get $650 per month 
and have $40 a month to live on 
after rent, electricity, and the 
phone bills are paid.” 

Former owner 
feels terrible 

Gill, who said he knows of 
similar evictions happening to at 
least two others, sobbed as he said 
a lifetime of memories are stored 
at 3967 18th Street, apartment 4. 
“I make less than $6,000 a year. 
I’ve had neuropathy, blindness, 
everything. I’ve had tuberculosis 
twice. I have struggled. I’ve buried 
200 friends,” Gill said. 

His story starts back in January 
1977 when Gill moved into the 
building. Back then, the owners 
were Louis Sranzes and Daniel 
Schick. Over the years, Gill helped 
out around the building, and in 
the process befriended the own¬ 


ers. Sranzes died in December 
1996, but it wasn’t until earlier 
this year that Schick sold the 
building. 

“He [Schick] says he’s sorry. 
He said his lover Lou is turning 
over in his grave,” Gill said. “I’ve 
only had two lovers and they both 
died here.” 

Gill has been involved in the 
Castro for decades and was the 
first black bartender at the Ele¬ 
phant Walk; more recently he 
worked as a personal trainer. “My 
whole life is in the Castro,” he 
said. 

Schick told the B.A.R. that he 
feels terrible about what’s hap¬ 
pening to Gill and said that 
Sranzes “made sort of a covenant 
with Gill that he would be pro¬ 
tected. 

“Gill is a terribly good tenant. 
He has the second most desirable 
apartment in the building. He 
decorated his place,” said Schick. 

According to Schick, his real 
estate agent was led to believe that 
Armstrong and Dinnocenzio were 
a couple. “That’s what I was told. 
Now, I understand they’re split¬ 
ting up,” said Schick. “I had to sell 
the building. I thought because of 
his HIV status, he [Gill] wouMbe 
okay. They paid a lot of money for 
it, I sold it for $560,000. They 
knew what the rents were and I 
thought they’d put Gill under 
their wing. I just have faith in 
common people. They are going 
to have to live with themselves.” 

Armstrong did not return re¬ 
peated calls from the B.A.R. ▼

Will what makes sense 


still make sense 


As we enter a new era in the treatment of HIV infection, the 
focus is shifting toward managing the disease over the long 
term. While early, aggressive therapy with a combination of 
potent antiretrovirals makes sense virologically, it poses 
serious questions for patients living with the disease^ 

Many who do well initially on combination therapy find 
themselves unable to tolerate treatment or adhere to rigorous 
schedules. Or the virus grows resistant to available drugs. 

Some answers will come from new, potent therapies that 
are more convenient to take, easier to tolerate, and can be 
readily combined with other antiretroviral drugs. 

But new therapies will raise other questions: Which drugs to 
use first? Which will give maximum response up front, yet still 
preserve future options? And will those future options be 
potent enough to give patients a "second" first chance? 

Glaxo Wellcome is committed to developing new long¬ 
term strategies, as well as new therapies, for clinicians and 
patients alike. Together, we can continue to change the way 
people think about treating HIV... today and tomorrow.

112 years ago this week: 


The president and the Ihamana 


by David Bianco 


This week in gay history: We'wha, 
a Zuni "berdache," calls on Pres¬ 
ident Grover Cleveland in Wash¬ 
ington, June 23, 1886. 

• eginning in the early 16th 
: : century, the Spanish and 
• French explorers who ar¬ 
rived in North America in search 
of land and wealth came into con¬ 
tact with many Native American 
societies that had existed for 
thousands of years. Among those 
whom the explorers encountered 
were transgendered “men- 
women” they called “berdachesa 
French term meaning “kept boys” 
or male prostitutes. 

Approximately 130 Native 
American tribes included some 
form of berdache, and each tribal 


language had a specific word for 
biological men who cross- 
dressed, lived as women, and 
often partnered with men. The 
Sioux, for example, called such in¬ 
dividuals wintkes, while the 
Chippewa knew them as 
agokwas. Among the 
Zunis, the term used was 
lhamanas. Most berdaches 
were found among tribes 
living west of the Mississippi 
River, though they were also 
present among 
Northeastern and 
Southern tribes. 

Epitomizing the 
European view of berdaches, one 
Spanish explorer described them 
as “impotent, effeminate men ... 
[who] go about dressed as 
women, and do women’s tasks.” 
But within Native cultures, 
berdaches played a much more 


important role, often performing 
sacred, shamanic functions and 
occupying places of honor within 
the various tribes. Among the 
Navaho, for example, berdaches 
had special ceremonial duties, 
such as preparing the food 
for sacred gatherings. The 
Sioux wintkes chose sacred 
names for the tribe’s male 
children. “If a wintke 
[was] in a family,” one 
Sioux told ethnographer 
Walter Williams, 
“that family would 
feel fortunate.” Some 
tribes revered the 
berdaches as healers, while others 
sought their advice as matchmak¬ 
ers. Berdaches might also be 
story-tellers, the keepers of tribal 
lore. 

Individuals tended to become 
berdaches, instead of being born 
into the role. They were not nec¬ 
essarily slight or “feminine” in ap¬ 
pearance, but were often strong 
and powerfully built, capable of 
assuming the most rigorous of 
women’s chores. Usually, boys of 
about 10 were allowed to choose 
berdache status, if they found 
themselves inclined toward 
women’s tasks, like weaving and 
cooking. Their childhood choice, 
it seems, was made for life. “On 
reaching puberty, their decision is 
final,” wrote anthropologist 
Mathilda Coxe Stevenson in her 
1896 study of the Zunis. 

Tribal members referred to 
berdaches as “she,” which led

many of the white Americans who 
met them to believe they were ei¬ 
ther biological women or her¬ 
maphrodites. Stevenson hosted 
the visit of We’wha, a Zuni 
Ihamana, to Washington during a 
six-month period in 1886, and 
We’wha was universally treated as 
a woman. One reporter, however, 
cast some doubt on the Zuni’s 
gender. We’wha, the Evening Star 
said, was no Pocahontas or Min¬ 
nehaha, but an individual whose 
“features,... especially her mouth, 
are rather large; her figure and 
carriage rather masculine.” De- 


havior and were expected as 
adults to pair off with other 
women. The female berdache 
most often written about was 
Qanqon, a member of the Kutenai 
tribe, who lived in the very early 
1800s. Accompanied by her wife, 
Qanqon worked as a guide and 
interpreter in the Pacific North¬ 
west, until falling victim to a 
Blackfoot attack in 1837. In the 
mid-19th century, Sahaykwisa, 
another female berdache ( hwame ) 
from the Mohave tribe, likewise 
had several female partners, 
whom she supported by hunting, 


“If a wintke [was] in a family," 
one Sioux told ethnographer 
Walter Williams, “that family 
would feel fortunate.” 


spite the disappointment some 
felt that the Ihamana wasn’t a 
dainty Indian princess, We’wha 
was the hit of the capital. The 
Zuni man-woman gave demon¬ 
strations of tribal weaving at the 
Smithsonian and charmed both 
President Grover Cleveland and 
Speaker of the House John G. 
Carlisle when introduced to them. 

But were the berdaches gay? At 
least in sexual behavior, they 
seemed to be. Early European ex¬ 
plorers wrote with horror of the 
“lewdness and unnatural acts” of 
the berdaches. As Mathilda Coxe 
Stevenson somewhat cryptically 
wrote, “There is a side to the lives 
of these men which must remain 
untold.” She further noted that 
“they never marry women, and it 
is understood that they seldom 
have any relations with them.” In 
fact, berdaches were almost always 
the sexual partners of non- 
berdache men. In this way, they 
seem like the forerunners of the 
“fairies” of early 20th-century 
American cultures, who coupled 
with traditionally masculine, 
“non-fairy” men. 

In about 30 tribes, there were 
also female berdaches, who 
dressed as men and acted as 
hunters and warriors. They, too, 
exhibited same-gender sexual be- 


farming, and occasionally prosti¬ 
tuting herself to white men. Mo¬ 
have legend has it that after being 
brutally raped by one woman’s 
jealous husband, Sahaykwisa 
stopped courting women. 

Just as Europeans brought dis¬ 
ease and alcoholism to Native 
American tribes, they also dissem¬ 
inated their negative ideas about 
the berdaches. In the late 1800s, 
sequestered on reservations and 
influenced by Christian mission¬ 
aries, many Native Americans 
began to view the berdaches as de¬ 
viants and no longer as sacred 
people. By the mid-20th century, 
there were almost no berdaches 
left among Native tribes, and ho¬ 
mosexuality was considered a 
white European phenomenon. In 
the 1970s and 1980s, though, the 
gay Indian movement sought to 
restore the berdaches (now com¬ 
monly called “two-spirits”) to 
their former place of distinction in 
Native American cultures. T

Lesbian and gay participation 
sought for 1999 Conference on Aging 


by Liz Highleyman 

T he Lesbian and Gay Aging 
Issues Network (LGAIN) is 
seeking gay and lesbian se¬ 
niors over 60 years old to partic¬ 
ipate in a conference on aging to 
be held in March 1999. The con¬ 
ference, which will take place in 
Orlando, Florida, is the 45th an¬ 
nual meeting of the American 
Society on Aging (ASA), the 
largest association of profession¬ 
als in the field of aging in the U.S. 

LGAIN is a constituent group 
of the ASA, and focuses on the is¬ 


sues of aging gays and lesbians. 
LGAIN aims to bring the con¬ 
cerns of older gays and lesbians 
to the attention of professionals 
who provide various services for 
the elderly, as well as to help 
make the voices of gay and les¬ 
bian seniors heard in their own 
communities. LGAIN hopes to 
bring older gay men and lesbians 
to Orlando to discuss their per¬ 
sonal experiences regarding is¬ 
sues such as: caregiving and re¬ 
ceiving, grandparenting, hous¬ 
ing, professional choices, and be¬ 
reavement. 

LGAIN is actively seeking 


funding to provide scholarship 
and travel assistance to elderly 
gay and lesbian attendees. Dona¬ 
tions from individuals and 
groups, as well as foundation 
grants, are encouraged. ▼ 


Information about LGAIN and 
ASA is available on the website

Florida prof conducts national 
study on lesbian domestic abuse 


by Vicky Kolakowski 

' Florida researcher is con- 
III! ducting one of the most ex¬ 
tensive nationwide studies 
ever of physical and verbal part¬ 
ner abuse in lesbian relationships. 

Dr. Cheryl Parks, an assistant 
professor at the School of Social 
Work at Florida State University, 
initiated the study because of the 
lack of data about the incidence, 
dynamics, and consequences of 
lesbian partner abuse. 

Although the problem of do¬ 
mestic violence in same-sex rela¬ 
tionships may be comparable in 
scope to that experienced in het¬ 
erosexual relationships, there is 
very little hard data available. 
Without such data, it is difficult to 
develop and provide resources for 
both victims and perpetrators. 

The survey covers basic infor¬ 
mation about relationships, expe¬ 
riences with partner abuse, and 
access to helping resources. It is 
totally anonymous, and may be 
completed either in a hard-copy 
paper format or by completing a 
form on Parks’s web site. The web

also have to provide that advantage 
to a customer’s legally registered 
domestic partner. It does not re¬ 
quire businesses that do not offer 
special advantages to institute any 
specific scheme or policy. 

Leno said he consulted with 
leaders in the business communi¬ 
ty, and so far has found no strong 
opposition to his plan. “Any resis¬ 
tance, I think, is just initial. Once 
they do look at it, they’ll recog¬ 
nize this is a way to please cus¬ 
tomers. Also, for businesses that 
have gay and lesbian employees, 
it raises morale and productivity,” 
said Leno. 

The newest member of the 
board of supervisors is himself a 
small business owner; he told the 
Bay Area Reporter that he’s dis¬ 
cussed the plan with the San 
Francisco Chamber of Commerce 
and that their staff members are 
looking into it. The chamber was 
an early supporter of the city’s 
landmark equal benefits law that 
went into effect just over a year 
ago. 

“We are adding one more cat¬ 
egory to a long list of categories,” 
Leno said. 

The legislation differs from last 
year’s equal benefits ordinance. 
That law requires companies doing 
business with the city to offer ben¬ 
efits to domestic partners of their 
employees, if those benefits are of-

funded social issue-related media 
such as: Marlon Riggs’s Tongues

I Shall Not Be Removed and the 
critically acclaimed Breathing 
Lessons. Established in 1987, the 
Independent Media Fund’s pri¬ 
mary focus is to support those 
artists whose work advocates pro¬ 
gressive social change. Some of 
the issues important to the fund 
relate to homelessness, censor¬ 
ship, homophobia, international 
issues, racial and gender justice, 
violence, and government ac¬ 
countability. 

Son of a slave 

Robeson was born in Prince¬ 
ton, New Jersey, the youngest of 
five children. His father was a run¬ 
away slave from a North Carolina 
plantation, who managed to grad¬ 
uate from college and become an 
African Methodist-Episcopal 
minister. Paul sang in the choir. 
His mother, born to one of the 
oldest recorded African-American 
families, the Bustills, assisted her 
husband in his work by visiting 
the sick and bedridden, collecting 
food and clothing for the poor, 
and finding work for refugees 
fleeing the horrific conditions of 
the South. She died tragically 
from burns suffered from a fire, 
when Paul was six years old. 

In 1915, the young Robeson 
won a four-year academic schol¬ 
arship to Rutgers University - the 
third black student admitted to 
the then-private college. After 
being harassed in the school glee 
club, he turned his energies to 
sports and excelled in track, bas¬ 
ketball, and football. He was the 
first All-American football player 
at Rutgers, but it wasn’t until 19 
years after his death that he was 
inducted into the College Football 
Hall of Fame. 

He earned a law degree in 1923 
and took a job with a prestigious 
law firm, but left the position after 
a white secretary refused to take 
dictation from him. He then 
turned his talents to the arts, 
where he made over 300 record¬ 
ings and acted in films such as The 
Emperor Jones, Proud Valley, and 
Jericho. Appearing live in produc¬

“It’s very appropriate that we 
remember this man, who was a 
fearless human rights activist, at 
pride,” said Judith Plummer, 
board member of the Bay Area Bi 
-Network and volunteer for 
Robeson pride events. “When you 
get past the food, the fun parties, 
and the parade, the point is to 
come together to celebrate our 
commitment to queer rights.” 

Poet Stephen Myers will per¬

nied by bass guitar artist Paris 
King, Myers will recite the poem, 
“Suite to the Mountains: for Paul

written by Antar Sudan Katara

In addition to performances, 
Karl Bruce Knapper is scheduled 
as a guest speaker for the dedica¬

for the Funding Exchange and 
representative for the Paul Robe¬ 
son Fund for Independent Media, 
told the B.A.R, “I grew up admir¬ 
ing his accomplishments. He was¬ 
n’t one of those creative people 
who did progressive art [only] as 
long as the work was praised. 

“He even put his career on the

commemorated at the San Fran¬

people remember Robeson as a 
star athlete, singer, actor, motion

Throughout the year, the Bay Area

Despite his achievements in 
the arts, Robeson chose to risk his 
popularity and success to make 
the struggle for equality his life’s

San Francisco Pride committee 
are very excited about the exhibit. 
Robeson’s life symbolizes every¬

Black gay pride 
weekend in Oakland 


by Cynthia Laird 


akland’s black gay, lesbian, 
II and transgender pride 
f weekend is here with a va¬ 
riety of events taking place start¬ 
ing Friday, June 19 and continu¬ 
ing through Sunday, June 21. 
Most of the events are free, and all 
are open to the public, said orga¬ 
nizer Bernard Henderson. 

“I’ve been planning it for a 
whole year,” Henderson told the 
Bay Area Reporter. “It’s to bring us 
together to talk about our issues 
and getting us to talk together.” 

“It’s Natural” is the theme of 
the pride weekend. The festivities 
get underway Friday night with 
the “Marlon Riggs Achievement 
Awards Ceremony” at the Park¬ 
way Theater, 1834 Park Boulevard 
at 18th Street from 7 to 9 p.m. 
Award recipients will include the

Boat, and Othello, he used his 
singing to promote black spiritu¬ 
als as inspiration to audiences 
around the world, those strug¬ 
gling in the labor movement, and 
for civil rights in the U.S. 

During the depression, Robe¬ 
son declared that he was fed up 
with racism in the U.S. and fought 
for an anti-lynching law. As a re¬ 
sult of his efforts to foster a better 
relationship between the U.S. and 
the former Soviet Union, he was 
interrogated by the House Un- 
American Activities Committee, 
led by Joseph McCarthy. Admir¬ 
ing the Soviet Union, he once 
said, “I walked the earth for the 
first time with complete dignity.” 
Though never known to be a 
member of the Communist party, 
he never backed down in his sup¬ 
port for the respect and equality 
he experienced in the Soviet 
Union, which resulted in his pass¬ 
port being revoked, and his work 
blacklisted at concert halls across 
the country. In 1952, he was 
barred from giving a concert at 
the San Francisco Opera House, 
but was allowed to perform at the 
Berkeley Community Theater. 

Robeson’s last public concert 
tour was in New Zealand and 
Australia, he retired in the early 
sixties and died in 1976 at the age 
of 77. 

Robeson summed up his con¬ 
viction by saying, “Every artist, 
every scientist must decide now 
where he stands.... The artist must 
elect to fight for freedom or slavery. 

I have made my choice.” On June 
19 through June 27, a photo exhib¬ 
it entitled Freedom or Slavery: The 
Paul Robeson Portfolio is open to 
the public at Bomani Gallery, lo¬ 
cated at 251 Post Street. T

If you're HIV+ you're often left feeling tired and weak. That means you could be anemic. Anemia 
is a condition where your body is not producing enough red blood cells. Because 
red blood cells carry oxygen, a decrease can cause symptoms such as fatigue 
and dizziness. Anemia is often a side effect of AZT and chemotherapeutic treatment. But now 
there's a proven, effective treatment that helps manage anemia and increase your energy level. 
It's called PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa)*. PROCRIT is a substance identical to one your body produces 
naturally. It helps stimulate your body's ability to increase your red blood cells. 

PROCRIT has a proven safety track record. Any adverse experiences associated with H ^ 

PROCRIT are kL ! IRISilB believed to be related to the disease process, not to therapy 
with PROCRIT. For cancer patients, only diarrhea and edema occurred more often 


with PROCRIT 


therapy than placebo (sugar pills). Please see the following 


prescribing information. Only your doctor can prescribe PROCRIT, so speak to him or her to learn 

more. And call Ortho Biotech Inc. for more information on PROCRIT PROGRIT 
and HIV-related anemia. Because tomorrow can be a good day. EPOE1 IN ALFA

PROCRIT 
EPOETIN ALFA 

INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
Treatment of Anemia in Zidovudine-treated HIV- 
infected Patients 

PROCRIT is indicated for the treatment of anemia 
related to therapy with zidovudine in HIV-infected 
patients. PROCRIT is indicated to elevate or maintain 
the red blood cell levels (as manifested by the hemat¬ 
ocrit or hemoglobin determinations) and to decrease 
the need for transfusions in these patients. PROCRIT 
is not indicated for the treatment of anemia in HIV- 
infected patients due to other factors such as iron or 
folate deficiencies, hemolysis or gastrointestinal bleed¬ 
ing, which should be managed appropriately. 

PROCRIT at a dose of 100 Units/kg three times per week 
is effective in decreasing the transfusion requirements 
and increasing the red blood cell level of anemic, 
HIV-infected patients treated with zidovudine, when 
the endogenous serum level of erythropoietin is £ 500 
mUnits/ml, and when patients are receiving a dose of 
zidovudine £ 4,200 mg/week. 

Responsiveness to PROCRIT therapy may be blunted 
by intercurrent infectious/inflammatory episodes and 
by an increase in zidovudine dosage. Consequently, 
the dose of PROCRIT must be titrated based on these 
factors to maintain the desired erythropoietic response. 

Treatment of Anemia in Cancer Patients on 
Chemotherapy 

PROCRIT is indicated for the treatment of anemia in 
patients with non-myeloid malignancies where anemia 
is due to the effect of concomitantly administered 
chemotherapy. PROCRIT is indicated to decrease the 
need for transfusions in patients who will be receiving 
concomitant chemotherapy for a minimum of 2 months. 
PROCRIT is not indicated for the treatment of anemia 
in cancer patients due to other factors such as iron or 
folate deficiencies, hemolysis or gastrointestinal 
bleeding which should be managed appropriately. 
Available evidence suggests that patients with lymphoid 
and solid cancers respond equivalently to PROCRIT 
therapy, and that patients with or without tumor 
infiltration of the bone marrow respond equivalently 
to PROCRIT therapy. 

CONTRAINDICATIONS 

PROCRIT is contraindicated in patients with: 

1) Uncontrolled hypertension. 

2) Known hypersensitivity to mammalian cell-derived 
products. 

3) Known hypersensitivity to Albumin (Human). 


rashes were occasionally observed concurrently with 
PROCRIT therapy, no serious allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions were reported. See “ADVERSE REACTIONS" 
for more information regarding allergic reactions. 

The safety and efficacy of PROCRIT therapy have not 
been established in patients with a known history of a 
seizure disorder or underlying hematologic disease 
(e.g., sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, 
or hypercoagulable disorders). 

In some female patients, menses have resumed 
following PROCRfT therapy; the possibility of pregnancy 
should be discussed and the need for contraception 
evaluated. 

Hematology: Exacerbation of porphyria has been 
observed rarely in patients with CRF treated with 
PROCRIT. Nevertheless, PROCRIT should be used 
with caution in patients with known porphyria. 

In preclinical studies in dogs and rats, but not in 
monkeys, PROCRIT therapy was associated with sub- 
clinical bone marrow fibrosis. Bone marrow fibrosis is a 
known complication of CRF in humans and may be related 
to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors. 

In zidovudine-treated HIV-infected and cancer 
patients, hematocrit should be measured once a week 
until stabilized and periodically thereafter. 

Delayed or Diminished Response: If the patient fails 
to respond or to maintain a response to doses within 
the recommended dosing range, the following etiolo¬ 
gies should be considered and evaluated: 

1) Iron deficiency: Virtually ail patients will eventu¬ 
ally require supplemental iron therapy (see “Iron 
Evaluation”). 

2) Underlying infectious, inflammatory, or malignant 


Pediatric Use: 

The multidose preserved formulation contains benzyl 
alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be asso¬ 
ciated with an increased incidence of neurological 
and other complications in premature infants which 
are sometimes fatal. The safety and effectiveness of 
Epoetin alfa in children have not been established. 

Thrombotic Events and Increased Mortality: 

In a randomized, prospective trial of 1265 hemodialysis 
patients with clinically evident cardiac disease 
(ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure), 
an increased mortality was observed in those patients 
randomized to a target hematocrit of 42% as compared 
to those patients targeted to remain at a hematocrit 
of 30%.The reason for increased mortality observed in 
these studies is unknown; however, the incidence of 
non-fatal myocardial infarction (3.1% vs. 2.3%), vas¬ 
cular access thrombosis (39% vs 29%), and all other 
thrombotic events (22% vs. 18%) were also higher in 
the group randomized to achieve a hematocrit of 42%. 
Increased mortality was observed in a randomized placebo- 
controlled study of PROCRIT in patients who did not have 
chronic renal failure who were undergoing coronary 
artery bypass surgery (7 deaths in 126 patients ran¬ 
domized to PROCRIT vs. no deaths among 56 patients 
receiving placebo). Four of these deaths occurred during 
the period of study drug administration and all four 
deaths were associated with thrombotic events. While 
the extent of the population affected is unknown, in 
patients at risk for thrombosis, the anticipated 
benefits of PROCRIT treatment should be weighed 
against the potential for increased risks associated 
with therapy. 

Zidovudine-treated HIV-infected Patients 

PROCRIT therapy has not been linked to exacerbation 
of hypertension, seizures, and thrombotic events in 
HIV-infected patients. 

PRECAUTIONS 

The parenteral administration of any biologic product 
should be attended by appropriate precautions in case 
allergic or other untoward reactions occur (see “CON¬ 
TRAINDICATIONS”). In clinical trials, while transient 


3) Occult blood loss. 

4) Underlying hematologic diseases (i.e., thalassemia 
refractory anemia, or other myelodysplastic disorder). 

5) Vitamin deficiencies: folic acid or vitamin B12. 

6) Hemolysis. 

7) Aluminum intoxication. 

8) Osteitis fibrosa cystica. 

Iron Evaluation: During PROCRIT therapy, absolute 
functional iron deficiency may develop. Functional 
iron deficiency, with normal ferritin levels but low 
transferrin saturation, is presumably due to the 
inability to mobilize iron stores rapidly enough to 
support increased erythropoiesis. Transferrin satura¬ 
tion should be at least 20% and ferritin should be at 
least 100 ng/mL. 

Prior to and during PROCRIT therapy, the patient’s iron 
status, including transferrin saturation (serum iron 
divided by iron binding capacity) and serum ferritin, 
should be evaluated. Virtually all patients will eventu¬ 
ally require supplemental iron to increase or maintain 
transferrin saturation to levels which will adequately 
support erythropoiesis stimulated by PROCRIT. 


Drug Interactions: No evidence of in 
PROCRIT with other drugs was observed in the 
course of clinical trials. 

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of 
Fertility: Carcinogenic potential of PROCRIT has not 
been evaluated. PROCRIT does not induce bacterial 
gene mutation (Ames Test), chromosomal aberra¬ 
tions in mammalian cells, micronuclei in mice, or 
gene mutation at the HGPRT locus. In female rats 
treated intravenously with PROCRIT, there was a 
trend for slightly increased fetal wastage at doses 
of 100 and 500 Units/kg. 

Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and 
well controlled studies in pregnant women. PROCRIT 
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 

In studies in female rats, there were decreases in 
body weight gain, delays in appearance of abdominal 
hair, delayed eyelid opening, delayed ossification, and 
decreases in the number of caudal vertebrae in the FI 
fetuses of the 500 Units/kg group. In female rats 
treated intravenously, there was a trend for slightly 
increased fetal wastage at doses of 100 and 500 
Units/kg. PROCRIT has not shown any adverse 
effect at doses as high as 500 Units/Kg in pregnant 
rabbits (from day 6 to 18 of gestation). 

Nursing mothers: Postnatal observations of the live 
offspring (FI generation) of female rats treated with 
PROCRIT during gestation and lactation revealed no 
effect of PROCRIT at doses of up to 500 Units/kg. 
There were, however, decreases in body weight gain, 
delays in appearance of abdominal hair, eyelid opening, 
and decreases in the number of caudal vertebrae in 
the FI fetuses of the 500 Units/kg group. There were 
no effects related to PROCRIT on the F2 generation 
fetuses. 

It is not known whether PROCRIT is excreted in human 
milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human 
milk, caution should be exercised when PROCRIT is 
administered to a nursing woman. 


Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of 
PROCRIT in children have not been established 
(see “WARNINGS"). 

Zidovudine-treated HIV-infected Patients: 

Hypertension: Exacerbation of hypertension has not 
been observed in zidovudine-treated HIV-infected 
patients treated with PROCRIT. However, PROCRIT 
should be withheld in these patients if pre-existing 
hypertension is uncontrolled, and should not be started 
until blood pressure is controlled. In double-blind 
studies, a single seizure has been experienced by a 
patient treated with PROCRIT. 

Cancer Patients on Chemotherapy 
Hypertension: Hypertension, associated with a signifi¬ 
cant increase in hematocrit, has been noted rarely in 
cancer patients treated with PROCRIT. Nevertheless, 
blood pressure in patients treated with PROCRIT 
should be monitored carefully, particularly in patients 
with an underlying history of hypertension or cardio¬ 
vascular disease. 

Seizures: In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 
3.2% of patients treated with PROCRIT and 2.9% of 
placebo-treated patients had seizures. Seizures in 
1.6% of patients treated with PROCRIT occurred in 
the context of a significant increase in blood pressure 
and hematocrit baseline values. However, both 
patient groups treated with PROCRIT also had 
underlying CNS pathology which may have been 
related to seizure activity. 

Thrombotic events: In double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trials, 3.2% of patients treated with PROCRIT and 11.8% 
of placebo-treated patients had thrombotic events 
(e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident). 
Growth Factor Potential: PROCRIT is a growth factor 
that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. 
However, the possibility that PROCRIT can act as a 
growth factor for any tumor type, particularly myeloid 
malignancies, cannot be excluded. 

ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Zidovudine-treated HIV-infected Patients 

Adverse events reported in clinical trials with PROCRIT 
in zidovudine-treated HIV-infected patients were 
consistent with the progression of HIV infection in 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of three 
months duration involving approximately 300 zidovu¬ 
dine-treated HIV-infected patients, adverse events 
with an incidence of >10% in either patients treated 
with PROCRIT or placebo-treated patients were:

There were no statistically significant differences 
between treatment groups in the incidence of the 
above events. 

In the 297 patients studied, PROCRIT was not associ¬ 
ated with significant increases in opportunistic infec¬ 
tions or mortality. In 71 patients from this group 
treated with PROCRIT at 150 Units/kg (T.I.W.), serum 
p24 antigen levels did not appear to increase. 
Preliminary data showed no enhancement of HIV 
replication in infected cell lines in vitro. 

Peripheral white blood cell and platelet counts are 
unchanged following PROCRIT therapy. 

Allergic Reactions: Two zidovudine-treated HIV-infected 
patients had urticarial reactions within 48 hours of 
their first exposure to study medication. One patient 
was treated with PROCRIT and one was treated with 
placebo (PROCRIT vehicle alone). Both patients had 
positive immediate skin tests against their study 
medication with a negative saline control. The basis 
for this apparent preexisting hypersensitivity to compo¬ 
nents of the PROCRIT formulation is unknown, but may 
be related to HIV-induced immunosuppression or prior 
exposure to blood products. 

Seizures: In double-blind and open-label trials of 
PROCRIT in zidovudine-treated HIV-infected patients, 
ten patients have experienced seizures. In general, 
these seizures appear to be related to underlying 
pathology such as meningitis or cerebral neoplasms, 
not PROCRIT therapy. 


Cancer Patients on Chemotherapy 

Adverse experiences reported in clinical trials with 
PROCRIT in cancer patients were consistent with the 
underlying disease state. In double-blind, placebo- 
controlled studies of up to 3-months duration involv¬ 
ing 131 cancer patients, adverse events with an inci¬ 
dence > 10% in either patients treated with PROCRIT 
or placebo-treated patients were as indicated below:

Trunk Pain 3%" 16% 

a p = 0.041 b p = 0.069 c p = 0.0016 d p = 0.017 

Although some statistically significant differences 
between patients treated with PROCRIT and placebo- 
treated patients were noted, the overall safety profile 
of PROCRIT appeared to be consistent with the dis¬ 
ease process of advanced cancer. During double¬ 
blind and subsequent open-label therapy in which 
patients (N=72) were treated for up to 32 weeks with 
doses as high as 927 Units/kg, the adverse experi¬ 
ence profile of PROCRIT was consistent with the pro¬ 
gression of advanced cancer. 

Based on comparable survival data and on the per¬ 
centage of patients treated with PROCRIT and place¬ 
bo-treated patients who discontinued therapy due to 
death, disease progression or adverse experiences 
(22% and 13%, respectively, p=0.25), the clinical 
outcome in patients treated with PROCRIT and place¬ 
bo-treated patients appeared to be similar. Available 
data from animal tumor models and measurement of 
proliferation of solid tumor cells from clinical biopsy 
specimens in response to PROCRIT does not potenti¬ 
ate tumor growth. Nevertheless, as a growth factor, 
the possibility that PROCRIT may potentiate growth of 
some tumors, particularly myeloid tumors, cannot be 
excluded. 

The mean peripheral white blood cell count was 
unchanged following PROCRIT therapy compared to 
the corresponding value in the placebo-treated 
group. 

OVERDOSAGE 

The maximum amount of PROCRIT that can be safely 
administered in single or multiple doses has not been 
determined. Doses of up to 1,500 Units/kg (T.I.W.) for 
three to four weeks have been administered without 
any direct toxic effects of PROCRFT itself. Therapy with 
PROCRIT can result in polycythemia if the hematocrit 
is not carefully monitored and the dose appropriately 
adjusted. If the suggested target range is exceeded, 
PROCRIT may be temporarily withheld until the hema¬ 
tocrit returns to the suggested target range; PROCRIT 
therapy may then be resumed using a lower dose (see 
"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION”). If polycythemia is 
of concern, phlebotomy may be indicated to decrease 
the hematocrit.

ganizers of the conference have 
noted a lack of coalition building 
between Chinese communities 
throughout the world, and wish 
to address this problem. Said con¬ 
ference organizer Gary Wu, “Chi¬ 
nese people live in many different 
cultures in many different coun¬ 
tries - it is important for people 
to get together and learn more 
about each other.” 

Another issue to be addressed 
at the conference will be the lack 
of resources for the Chinese queer 
community abroad. Lucky Choi, 
assistant conference coordinator, 
pointed out the fact that resources 
for the queer community in China 
are virtually nonexistent: “In 
China, there are no community- 
based HIV/AIDS organizations, 
no PFLAG to educate and support 
their families, no role modeling 
programs for their youth, no AIDS 
quilt for bereavement, and no sui¬ 
cide prevention hotlines.” Yet even 
if agencies were created, the sheer 
size and culture of China would 
pose an immense problem for dis¬ 
seminating information. “In big 
cities there are places to meet, like 
bars, but China is very big and 
most people live in villages where 
it would be hard to get any infor¬ 
mation,” said Wu. Conference at¬ 
tendees will attempt to address 
this challenge by discussing and 
planning the creation of an inter¬ 
national support network, per¬ 
haps based in Hong Kong, as to 
better serve the East Asian area. 

In addition to discussing 
methods of outreaching to queer 
Chinese, the conference will offer 
a full-day symposium of work¬ 
shops, forums, and panel discus¬ 
sions, which will be presented by 
internationally renowned speak¬ 
ers. Dozens of topics will be cov¬ 
ered, including “Interracial & 
Cross Cultural Relationships,” 
“Tongzhi in the Media,” “Families 
and Tongzhi,” “Sexuality in Chi¬ 
nese Culture,” “Ageism in The 
Tongzhi Community,” “Living in 
America: A Double Minority,” 
and “Voices of Lesbian Tongzhi.” 

A Tongzhi book fair of hun¬ 
dreds of titles donated by over 30 
Hong Kong and Taiwan publish¬ 
ers will also be held over the 
weekend in the Castro neighbor¬ 
hood. 

In the end, conference orga¬ 
nizers hope the program will 
begin to foster a pan-cultural 
community and broaden aware¬ 
ness of the existence of Chinese 
Tongzhi. Even here in San Fran¬ 
cisco, the Tongzhi community has 
not found much support from the 
broader Chinese community. 
“Here we have the two most in¬ 
fluential communities in San 
Francisco, the queer community 
and the Chinese community - we 
need to have more collaboration 
between the two and have a com¬ 
mon goal,” said Choi. 

Choi hopes that by the end of 
pride weekend, the attainment of 
that goal will be in sight. ▼

•Li. nee the center of gay life in 
San Francisco, Polk Street in 
recent years has been over¬ 
shadowed as a tourist destination 
by the more glamorous, upscale 
Castro. But with the city’s annual 
gay pride celebration returning to 
Civic Center after a long absence, 
drawing thousands of hungry, 
thirsty queers to the foot of Polk 
Street, merchants along the strip 
want to claim some of the action. 
Many, including several new to 
the street, are actively enticing 
revelers to their establishments 
during the week of festivities, and 
showing off their neighborhood’s 
current renaissance. 

The Polk Street Merchants As¬ 
sociation, headed by QT II bar 
owner Marv Warren, hopes 
newly-created “Passport to Polk 
Street” booklets will draw crowds 
to the neighborhood commonly 
called the Polk Gulch. The $5 
booklets offer revelers discount 
coupons redeemable for up to $25 
worth of goods and services at a 
host of participating bars, restau¬ 
rants, and retail stores. 

Post-paraders can quench 
their thirsts at such venerable Polk 
Street drinking establishments as 
Reflections, the Giraffe, Kimo’s, 
the Rendezvous, the Swallow, and 
QT II, among others, or find se¬ 
lect video entertainment at the 
Locker Room. The exterior of the 
latter sports a huge banner adver¬ 
tising “sales galore” in time for the 
pride celebrants. 

A must-see on the street is the 
spanking new, thoroughly remod¬ 
eled 1100 Club, which opened 
June 12 at the site of the former 
Polk Gulch Saloon. 

Jon Crovo, who opened the 
club with partners Matt Neal and 
Dean Leri after purchasing the 
building on May 8, said that while 
many new beers will be served on 
tap, some things at the club will 
remain the same. 

“Friday nights will still be drag 
nights,” he hastened to assure reg¬ 
ular patrons, and the ever-popu- 
lar Cockataelia will perform on 
June 26, at about 10 p.m. Wednes¬ 
days will continue to be “ladies’ 
night,” he added. 

The 1100 Club redesign in¬ 
cludes a small stage where stand- 
up comics, jazz combos, and divas 
will perform. High-energy DJs 
and light shows will liven the club 
after nightfall. 

On many occasions the 1100 
Club will host fundraisers for 
nonprofit organizations, said 
Crovo, who serves on the board of. 
the Rainbow Community Center 
in Contra Costa County. 


Ready for business: A workman puts the finishing touches on the 1100 Club. 


Shelter to relocate 

Just a short walk up the block, 
at 1338 Polk Street, is Margie’s 
Diner, opened just four months 
ago by former Polk Gulch Saloon 
manager Steve Valone, who 
moved to the city 18 years ago 
from Chicago. 

“We have the best food on the 
block,” Valone insisted, emerging 
from a sparkling clean kitchen to 
proffer a menu replete with eight 
kinds of burgers (as well as “build 
your own” models), homemade 
soups, appetizers, meaty hot 
sandwiches, “pink plate specials” 
(including meatloaf and roast 


beef), and (for those early risers) a 
complete breakfast lineup. 

With lots of mirrors and 
framed photos on the walls, 
Margie’s features a slick, early 
1960s design, and already draws a 
crowd of neighborhood regulars. 

Along with the 1100 Club and 
Quetzal, another new eatery on 
the street, Margie’s represents the 
rebirth of Polk Street after a long 
decline, brought on in the 1980s 
in part by the toll AIDS took 
among neighborhood residents 
and shopkeepers, and, according 
to Warren, by an influx of pan¬ 
handlers and drug dealers.

“We Represent You, Not a Purchasing Company” 

— Carole Fiedler 


Happily, in the merchants’ view, 
a central contributor to the prob¬ 
lem will soon be moving out of the 
neighborhood. The homeless shel¬ 
ter now occupying a large building 
at the corner of Polk and Geary 
may at some point relocate to the 
China Basin area South of Market. 

Warren said that when then- 
Mayor Art Agnos installed the 
shelter on Polk Street against mer¬ 
chants’ wishes in the early 1980s, 
the number of homeless people 
hanging out on the street in¬ 
creased dramatically. At the same 
time, crime rose in the neighbor¬ 


hood, including heroin and speed 
dealing, rape, and even murder. 

With stepped up policing in 
the area, along with ongoing ef¬ 
forts to revitalize the area, said 
Warren, the street is fast turning 
around. A new multiplex theater 
will soon be in operation on the 
street, and storefronts currently 
boarded up may soon be boasting 
displays by new shop owners. An 
influx of young artists to the 
neighborhood is adding a new 
Bohemian touch to the area. 

Ironically, it’s the grunge fac-

Poliakov murder 

◄ page 1 

himself from a sexual assault. 

In an exclusive interview with 
the Bay Area Reporter, the star 
witness for the prosecution’s case 
against Puckett says he feels very 
uncomfortable about his role in 
the trial, but feels he had to come 
forward as a matter of conscience. 

“David’s” name will be made 
public when he testifies next 
week, but as a condition of the in¬ 
terview, he asked the B.A.R. to 
withhold his name, until after'he 
takes the stand. 

David met Puckett at a party 
last June. Puckett left the party with 
David and a young woman and 
headed to David’s apartment. 
David, who - like Puckett - is strik¬ 
ingly handsome, says after they got 
to his place the woman said it was 
obvious that Puckett wanted David 
more than her, and she left. 

Puckett stayed the night. David 
says they had sex once, but he de¬ 
clined to go into detail. He adds 
that Puckett was “very physically 
affectionate” and had made over¬ 
tures towards him on several oc¬ 
casions, but he says he had only 
one sexual contact with him. 

Puckett stayed with him off 
and on over the summer. 

Puckett called David just hours 
before he killed Vitaly Poliakovi 
over Labor Day weekend, and 
“sounded very cold, like a differ¬ 
ent person.” David says Puckett 
talked about how he and his 
friend had just burglarized some¬ 
one’s house. “He was in his street 
talk mode.” David says he would 
get that way from time to time 
and talk about how angry he was, 
and would refer to gay men as 
“faggots.” David believes Puckett 
had a lot of internalized homo¬ 
phobia. “I knew it was only a mat¬ 
ter of time before he killed a gay 
man, I was just glad it wasn’t me.” 

David adds that Puckett had 
said several times that he had 
wanted to kill someone. On one 
occasion, he says Puckett broke 
down and cried about how bad 
his life was. 

David tells the B.A.R. he still 
has feelings for Puckett, and that 
it will be hard for him to take the 
stand and say anything negative 
about him. He says he’s even con¬ 
sidered going back on everything 
he’s told prosecutors, but he says 
he’ll tell the truth when he testi¬ 
fies because he believes Puckett 
should have to pay for his crime. 

David adds that he feels ex¬ 
tremely uncomfortable about tes¬ 
tifying about having sex with 
Puckett. Prosecutors will try to 
elicit that testimony to keep Puck¬ 
ett’s attorney from using any sort 
of “gay panic” defense, that gay sex 
was so alien to Puckett that he re¬ 
acted in a panic to what he per¬ 
ceived to be a repugnant act. 

As the B.A.R. reported last 
week, prosecutors believe they can 
prove Puckett had a sexual rela¬ 
tionship with his victim, Poliakov. 
A DNA analysis of semen stain on 


Poliakov’s bedding showed it was 
Poliakov’s, but it was mixed with 
Puckett’s saliva. 

Girlfriend: ‘He’s straight’ 

The B.A.R has learned that at 
least one of Puckett’s girlfriends 
will likely be called to testify for 
the defense. “Linda” also spoke to 
the B.A.R under the condition of 
anonymity. She says that although 
she met Puckett in a gay club, she’s 
convinced that he’s straight. Linda 
believes Puckett had a great 
friendship with the gay commu¬ 
nity and because of his good looks 
and affable personality, he was af¬ 


forded opportunities that he may 
not have been afforded in any 
other community. 

Linda says she is aware of 
Puckett’s juvenile crime history, 
but she believes he was only act¬ 
ing in self-defense. 

“If someone tried to rape me,” 
she said, “I’d hit them on the head 
with the first thing I could find, 
too.” 

Puckett confessed to hitting 
Poliakov several times with a bot¬ 
tle. Investigators believe the fatal 
blow likely came from behind, 
while Poliakov was lying on his 
stomach. T

U R T REP 


The defense 
reveals its strategy 

Mi his week, Josh Puckett’s 
■ defense attorney, Mark 
I Liss, tried to get prosecu¬ 
tor Barry Grove thrown off the 
case for allegedly intimidating 
his star witness. On Monday, 
that witness, Michael Stephan, 
took the stand to testify against 
Grove, but in the process was 
asked by Judge James Marchi- 
anio to reveal what he planned 
to testify to during the trial. 

Stephan related an incident 
two years ago in which he said 
Vitaly Poliakov had tried to sex¬ 
ually assault him and a friend. 

He said it left him feeling “ner- 

vous, scared, and endangered.” He said he identified with what 
Puckett must have felt in his encounter with Poliakov. 

Stephan testified that he attended a party on Poliakov’s house¬ 
boat with several other people, He said that as the party ensued he 
and a friend became tired, and went to sleep on the front of the 
boat. He says they were both lying down fully clothed when Poli¬ 
akov pulled back a curtain and entered that section of the boat. He 
said Poliakov “removed his pants and held his belt over us.” Stephan 
says Poliakov then tried to remove his friend’s belt. He says his 
friend “got scared” and told Poliakov to leave him alone. He says 
that’s when Poliakov approached him. He said he held onto Poli¬ 
akov's belt and glared at him and Poliakov went away. 

Stephan was not cross-examined on his testimony relating to 
the houseboat incident, so it’s unclear about the manner in which 
Poliakov was holding his belt, or why he felt threatened by it. After 
Stephan left the stand, Grove said that Stephan had acknowledged 
to him that he brunched with Poliakov the day following the al¬ 
leged attempted sexual assault. Stephan declined to speak with the 
Bay Area Reporter outside the hearing. 

Most of Stephan’s testimony centered around a 10-minute tele¬ 
phone conversation he had with Grove. Liss says Grove had tried to 
intimidate Stephan into changing his story. Stephan testified that 
Grove had volunteered information about Puckett’s criminal 
record, but he said he wasn’t influenced into changing his story. 

Liss told Marchiano that Grove was trying to bully Stephan. He 
said the incident was another example of Grove overstepping his 
bounds as a prosecutor. 

Liss again brought up the issue of a letter to the editor published 
in the B.A.R. in March, in which Grove had pleaded for anyone 
with information to come forward. Another judge had previously 
ruled against the defense’s request to get Grove removed over the 
letter. Liss again stated his belief that Grove had used the B.A.R. to 
rally the gay community against his client. 

Marchiano ruled against the defense’s request to remove Grove 
from the case or to impose sanctions, but he said he would revisit 
the matter during a hearing after the trial. He added that he found 
Stephan to be a “soft-spoken and very credible” witness. 

Marchiano announced that he‘expects the case to take three 

weeks T -Ed Walsh

NGLTF releases 
survey on tolerance 


by Liz Highleyman 


s " /' he Policy Institute of the Na¬ 
tional Gay and Lesbian Task 
Force (NGLTF) recendy re¬ 
leased the results of a new analysis 
that shows that a majority of 
Americans support some civil 
rights for gay/lesbian/bisexual/ 
transgender people. However, there 
are still several areas in which anti¬ 
gay sentiment remains entrenched. 

The report of the analysis, enti- 
ded From Wrongs To Rights: Pub¬ 
lic Opinion On Gay and Lesbian 
Americans Moves Toward Equality, 
was released May 29. The study, 
authored by doctoral candidate 
Alan Yang of Columbia Universi¬ 
ty, is a meta-analysis that looks at 
public opinion polls conducted 
over the last two decades. The re¬ 
port examines public sentiment in 
the areas of family issues, employ¬ 
ment, housing, the military, and 
sodomy laws. The report does not 
specify whether the polls that were 
analyzed asked about gay men and 
lesbians only, or whether they also 
examined public opinion regard¬ 
ing bisexuals and transgendered 
people; many surveys do not dis¬ 
tinguish among these groups. 

Among the more encouraging 
findings, the analysis found that a 
majority of Americans support 
equal rights for gays in the areas of 
employment (84 percent), hous¬ 
ing (81 percent), the military (66 


percent), and inheritance rights 
(62 percent) and social security 
benefits for same-sex couples (57 
percent). Positive attitudes about 
equal employment extend to con¬ 
troversial positions such as teach¬ 
ers, doctors, clergy, and elected of¬ 
ficials. Support for gay and lesbian 
elementary school teachers dou¬ 
bled between 1977 and 1996 (now 
55 percent in favor). Fifty-three 
percent even say that being gay or 
lesbian should not disqualify one 
from becoming president. About 
70 percent of respondents believe 
that homosexual sex between con¬ 
senting adults in the privacy of 
their own homes, should be legal. 

According to Policy Institute 
director Urvashi Vaid, the report 
“illustrates the success of efforts to 
achieve civil equality” for queers. 
She added that, “The post- 
Stonewall strategies of coming 
out, public education, steady lob¬ 
bying, direct action, and cam¬ 
paigns for legal equality have suc¬ 
cessfully shifted public opinion 
toward support for equal rights.” 

However, there are several 
areas in which discrimination re¬ 
main entrenched and, according 
to Vaid, queers remain “one of the 
most disliked groups in the na¬ 
tion.” A majority of Americans 
still disapprove of same-sex rela¬ 
tionships (56 percent opposed) - 
although the percentage has de¬ 
clined substantially from 75 per¬ 
cent in 1987 - and same-sex mar¬ 


riage (65 percent opposed). About 
half disapprove of adoption by 
same-sex couples, down from 
two-thirds opposed earlier in the 
decade. Fifty-two percent of re¬ 
spondents in 1997 said that same- 
sex relationships between con¬ 
senting adults were “morally 
wrong.” 

The analysis indicates that po¬ 
litical ideology and party affilia¬ 
tion are connected to attitudes to¬ 
ward gay equality. Republicans 
and self-defined conservatives are 
less likely to express tolerance to¬ 
ward gays, but the most vehement 
anti-gay sentiment is limited to a 
small right-wing minority. Ac¬ 
cording to NGLTF Executive Di¬ 
rector Kerry Lobel,“In its opposi¬ 
tion to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
transgender equality, it is the right 
wing that is out of step with 
mainstream America.” 

NGLTF is an advocacy organi¬ 
zation that works to eliminate 
prejudice, violence and injustice 
against gay, lesbian, bisexual and 
transgendered people at the local, 
state and national levels. The 
NGLTF Policy Institute is a think 
tank dedicated to research, policy 
analysis, and strategic projects to 
advance greater understanding 
and the equality of lesbian, gay, bi¬ 
sexual and transgender people. ▼

Navy, AOL settle with gay sailor 


United Press International 


WM he U.S. Navy and America 
Online have settled lawsuits 
H filed by a sailor who was in¬ 
vestigated after he posted an 
anonymous online message de¬ 
scribing himself as gay. 

Under the Navy agreement, 36- 
year-old Master Chief Petty Offi¬ 
cer Timothy McVeigh will retire 
from the Navy with full benefits 
and receive money for legal fees. 
He is no relation to the Oklahoma 
City bomber of the same name. 

America Online spokeswoman 
Tricia Primrose told United Press 
International the online giant has 
apologized for giving out 
McVeigh’s name. Under a separate 


agreement, the company has 
agreed to pay an unspecified 
amount for damages. 

Primrose said: “We recognized 
that AOL had made a mistake. We 
realize that what happened was a 
result of human error, and we ab¬ 
solutely regret it.” 

In a telephone interview, 
McVeigh told the New York Times, 
“I’m happy that this case has been 
resolved on my terms.... I hope it 
sends the message that the rules and 
regulations that are in place need to 
be followed by the military.” 

The Navy had originally 
sought to discharge the decorated 
sailor without any benefits be¬ 
cause he posted a note on Ameri¬ 
can Online that identified himself 
as “Tim,” a “gay” man with the e- 


mail address “Boysrch.” 

Primrose admitted the Navy 
investigator duped an AOL em¬ 
ployee into confirming that the 
company had a customer match¬ 
ing McVeigh’s name. “The person 
calling pretended to be a friend 
(of McVeigh’s),” she said, “and 
misled our customer service rep¬ 
resentative.” America Online has 
since rewritten its privacy policy 
in easier-to-understand language. 

Last January, a Washington 
federal judge ordered the Navy to 
halt its efforts to dismiss McVeigh, 
and ruled the Navy’s probe into 
his sexual orientation violated the 
military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” 
policy that ostensibly bars the 
military from inquiring about a 
service member’s sexuality. ▼

Homosexuality 
is a sin, declares Lott 

And there's a same-sex twist to the story

hose wacky Republicans just 
keep saying the darndest 
things. This time it is Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott 
mouthing off that homosexuality 
is a sin. “You should still love that 
person,” he added. “You should 
not try to mistreat them or treat 
them as outcasts. You should 
show them a way to deal with the 
problem, like alcohol ... or sex 
addiction ... or kleptomaniacs.” 

Lott’s “enlightened” remarks 
came at a taping of a cable televi¬ 
sion public affairs program, The 
Armstrong Williams Show , slated 
for airing in mid to late June. The 
host is African-American and a 
darling of the right wing. 

“Senator Lott has insulted 
every gay person in the Republi¬ 
can Party,” said Rich Tafel, execu¬ 
tive director of Log Cabin Repub¬ 
licans. “Doesn’t he realize that the 
American Psychological Associa¬ 
tion put this issue behind them 25 
years ago?” 

These comments show “how 
the extreme right wing has a 
stranglehold on the leadership” of 
Congress, said Winnie Stachel- 
berg, political director of the 
Human Rights Campaign (HRC). 
She said that Lott was “out of step 
with the American people and 
prevailing medical and mental 
health opinion.” 

The White House echoed her 
comment Tuesday, with press sec¬ 
retary Mike McCurry describing 
the-Mississippi Republican as em¬ 
blematic of conservatives who are 
“so backward in their thinking.” 

McCurry insisted that for 
more than 25 years, “it’s been 
quite clear that sexual orientation 
is not an affliction, it is not a dis¬ 
ease, it is something that is a part 
of defining one’s sexuality.” 

McCurry said, “The fact that 
the majority leader has such 
views, apparently consistent with 
some who are fairly extreme in his 
party, is an indicator of how diffi¬ 
cult it is to do rational work in 
Washington.” 

Lott later told reporters, “Mr. 
McCurry’s experience with this 
White House does not qualify 
him to tell the American people 
what is right and what is wrong. 
What he considers backward are 
the views and values of a great 



Trent Lott 


majority of Americans, who un¬ 
derstand and are concerned about 
the grave social and ethical ques¬ 
tions our country faces.” 

Williams ‘hypocrisy?’ 

The incident abounds with 
much less than seven degrees of 
separation from a gay angle. Key 
is the fact that a former employ¬ 
ee, Stephen Gregory, is suing 
Armstrong Williams for same-sex 
sexual harassment. In a lawsuit 
filed in April of last year and a 
news conference outside the 
court-house Gregory claimed, 
“He touched me on the butt, he 
grabbed my penis.” Williams de¬ 
nied it. Both men proclaimed 
their heterosexuality. 

The case has proceeded at its 
own turgid pace. A few weeks ago 
the court dismissed Williams’s 
motion to have it thrown out, said 
Gregory’s attorney Mickey J. 
Wheatley. The case appears to be 
headed for a fall trial. 

Wheatley charges that 
Williams, in anticipation of the 
trial, is attempting to build up his 
stature with the far right by gay 
baiting. “It just points out the 
hypocrisy of this charade.” 

Lott has his own gay connec¬ 
tions. His press secretary, Susan 
Irby, once worked for openly gay 
Congressman Steve Gunderson, 
now retired. And in the 1980s, his 
colleague, Mississippi Republican

tor, along with the area’s slightly 
lower rent, that draws the artists 
to the Polk Gulch neighborhood. 
Some, such as Brent Haas of 
SPACE, a combination art gallery 
and hair salon next door to the 
Giraffe bar, expresses fondness for 
the street’s hustlers, trannies, and 
homeless denizens. In its year of 
operation, SPACE has enjoyed 
considerable success, showcasing 
the neighborhood’s considerable 
talent while turning out multi- 
hued hairstyles that add to the 
local color. 

Not easy yet 

To be sure, not every new busi¬ 
ness on the street is finding 
overnight success. One new cafe 
catering mostly to young artists, 


the Eleven Eleven Lounge, is still 
struggling after only six months in 
operation. 

“It takes time to build up a 
clientele,” said owner Josie Lazo, 
whose establishment features 
multi-ethnic vegetarian and vegan 
fare along with occasional yoga 
classes, tarot readings, live jazz, and 
various DJs. In contrast with the 
gleaming interior of Margie’s, the 
Eleven Eleven Lounge has a funky, 
almost divey atmosphere that has 
yet to catch on in a big way with 
the area’s denizens. Yet Lazo holds 
out hope that those who prefer 
non-meat meals will eventually 
find their way to her place. 

Pride goers who make their way 
up Polk Street during the celebra¬ 
tion will discover that far from 
being a relic of its historic self, the 
street is shaking itself up, becom¬ 
ing the next big thing to happen in 
the queer community. T 


Congressman Jon Hinson, was ar¬ 
rested in a Longworth House of¬ 
fice building rest room having sex 
with another man. Hinson lost his 
bid for reelection and later died of 
AIDS. 

But given that Lott believes 
that homosexuals should be loved 
and not treated as outcasts, per¬ 
haps he will then see fit to sched¬ 
ule a confirmation vote on the 
long-delayed nomination of 
James Hormel as ambassador to 
Luxembourg. Even the conserva¬ 
tive Wall Street Journal has edito¬ 
rially opined that only bigotry has 
prevented a vote on the San Fran¬ 
ciscan’s nomination. 

Democratic Senator Paul Well- 
stone of Minnesota took to the 
Senate floor Tuesday to criticize 
Lott’s remarks, and his seven- 
month delay of Senate considera¬ 
tion of Hormel. 

Wellstone said, “I think the 
vast majority of senators are 
ready to vote for Mr. 
Hormel...and I think the U.S. 
Senate would be better off if we 
bring this nomination to the 
floor. ... Otherwise, I worry 
about a climate that is going to 
become increasingly polarized, 
increasingly poisonous.” ▼

other insurance companies?” 
speculated Rick Solomon, a Hep 
C and HIV patient. 

Hext, who has almost died at 
least twice in the last six months 
from liver failure, is outraged. Re¬ 
cently, he stormed out of the U.C 
Liver Transplant Center Clin¬ 
ic in tears, threatening 
lawsuits against both 
UC and MediCal. 

Doctors responded by 
downgrading Hext’s 
need for liver transplant, 
a tactic that Golden Gate 
activists have seen before 
when the Veteran’s 
Administration Hos¬ 
pital changed the sta¬ 
tus of a would-be 
heart transplant patient to low 
priority after advocate groups 
stepped in to help. 

subhead 

“The reason that UC has not 
gone ahead with its HIV+ trans¬ 
plant program is because they de¬ 
clared these transplants to be ex¬ 
perimental,’ thereby excluding 
most insurance coverage,” said 
Brenda Lein of Project Inform. 
“Although they say they planned 
to obtain other funding, there was 
no real attempt made to do so, 
until only recently when Golden 
Gate forced a showdown in April.” 

Lein, Golden Gate activists, 
and others attended a tense meet¬ 
ing between UC transplant sur¬ 
geons, MediCal officials, and 
other medical insurers in April. 
The outcome of the meeting was 
an expected collusion between 
conservative surgeons and insur¬ 
ance companies not to pay for any 
transplants. Surgeons who would 
have been in favor of going for¬ 
ward with HIV+ liver and kidney 
transplants were not at the meet¬ 
ing, which was arranged by Med¬ 
iCal and Ascher. The pleas of both 
AIDS activists and AIDS clini¬ 
cians fell on deaf ears. There was 
only agreement to move forward 
with research protocols. 

To date there have been sever¬ 
al liver transplants performed on 
HIV+ patients. Most of these took 
place before there were any good 
treatments for HIV disease, and 
most of these patients went on to 
die from AIDS. Recently, there 
have been three or four HIV+ 
liver transplants on patients who 
are using the new HIV cocktail 
treatment therapies. News from 
two such patients who received 
livers in Pennsylvania have been 
good so far. The condition of the 
UC patient is unknown. 

There is little data to prove 



whether or not these transplants 
are viable; the only way to find out 
is to go ahead with the surgery. 
Third party coverage is essential 
and historically not untypical to 
such transplant research. Activists 
and patients feel that telling in¬ 
surance companies that these 
transplants are of higher risk 
is within reason, but the 
^ usual definition of “ex¬ 
perimental” does not 
pertain since there is 
no. need for FDA ap¬ 
proval. 

“The outright denial 
, of consideration of 

any one group of 
people - PWAs, who 
now live a very long 
time - is a sad and scary prece¬ 
dent,” said Virginia Cafaro, M.D., 
a local AIDS clinician. “Who will 
be next?” 

Some wonder if there isn’t 
some other reason why these 
transplants are not moving for¬ 
ward quickly. One need only read 
correspondence between sur¬ 
geons and state officials to discov¬ 
er that the issue of scarce organ 
supply is a prime concern. A re¬ 
cent letter from MediCal to State 
Assemblywoman Carol Migden 
closed with a paragraph that 
voiced such concerns. 

“Why is MediCal suddenly in 
the organ allocation business?” 
questions Alan Franciscan, a Hep 
C activist. “Perhaps the real reason 
these transplants aren’t happen¬ 
ing is because the conservative 
transplant community doesn’t 
want yet another disease group 
competing for these organs.” 

Meanwhile, Hext and several 
other potential liver transplant 
patients’ lives hang in the balance. 
“I cannot express the anger and 
frustration I feel over this situa¬ 
tion,” Hext said recently. Rather 
than attend Hext’s memorial ser¬ 
vice, Golden Gate activists decid¬ 
ed to force the issue with an old 
fashioned street demonstration at 
the UCSF Parnassus campus, in 
front of the Medical Sciences 
Building, Wednesday, June 17, at 
noon. 

Featured speakers were San 
Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammi- 
ano, AIDS Clinician Dr. Mary 
Roymayne, and representatives 
from the Hep C Support Project. 

“I never guessed I would be 
demonstrating with ACT UP in 
the streets,” Hext said, “but now I 
realize how push comes to shove, 
and why these demonstrations are 
needed. I am literally fighting for 
my own life, and the lives of oth¬ 
ers with my condition.” ▼

Douglas Boris Espy 

Jan. 22,1938 — June 11,1998 


May his memo¬ 
ry be eternal! 

Doug was born 
at an early age in 
San Francisco, and 
lived in and around 
the Bay Area for al¬ 
most all of his 60 
years. A true San 
Franciscan, he lived 
his life to its fullest. 

He became ill shortly before Russian 
Orthodox Easter in April. He was hospi¬ 
talized on Mother’s Day at SF General 
Hospital, where he died. 

Doug, well-known in the leather 
community since the mid-1950s, was a 
member of Men in Boots, a bartender at 
the original Tool Box, and a former 
member of the G.D.I. Leather Club. He 
was also a member in good standing of 
Saints Theodore Tiro and Theodore 
Stratilates Eastern Orthodox Parish, and 
served as reader in the parish. He is sur¬ 
vived by his lover of three years, Steven 
Duysen. 

Funeral services will be held on Sat¬ 


urday, June 27, at 10:30 a.m. at Saints 
Theodore Tiro and Theodore Stratilates 
Eastern Orthodox Parish, located at the

Jim Rasmussen 

Oct. 21,1931 — May 19,1998 


James N. Ras¬ 
mussen died of nat¬ 
ural causes at his 
home in the Twin 
Peaks area of San 
Francisco on Tues¬ 
day, May 19. He 
was 66. 

Jim, the only 
child of the late 
Charles A. and . 
Juanita M. Rasmussen, was born in 
Centralia, Wash.; attended elementary 
and high school in Seattle; studied engi¬ 
neering at the University of Washing¬ 
ton; and served with distinction in the 
U.S. Navy as a sonarman first class dur¬ 
ing the Korean War. After the Navy, he 
moved to Los Angeles, where his artistic 
talents led to a successful career as a 
puppeteer and musician (the accordion) 
with the Turnabout Theatre there and 
in San Francisco. 

In 1960, Wells Fargo Bank employed 
him in its then new Computer Division. 
He rose to become data programming 
engineer before retiring in 1979. Since 
then he had enjoyed a life of leisure. 

Jim is survived by his cousin, 
Dorothy Roe of Seattle, and a host of 
friends here. He will be missed for his 
outgoing good humor, and an unfailing 
and endless supply of greeting cards for 
all occasions.

former Empress XVIII Connie) 
this Saturday, June 20. It will be

Garron was an accomplished

land and Berkeley symphonies, 
plus many of the civil light opera 
groups in the Bay Area. A pianist 
and a harpist as well, he also per¬ 
formed for numerous weddings

Francisco.

but it’s start, and those programs 
found in violation will most like¬ 
ly be reviewed by the Department 
of Public Health’s AIDS Office for 
being in violation of the contract. 

The lack of heat resulted in an¬ 
other serious problem at Derek 
Silva. Many residents went Out 
and bought space heaters. While 
the heaters helped keep rooms 
warmer, they overloaded the elec¬ 
trical system so that power out¬ 
ages became frequent, angering 
residents all the more. 

Another previous problem in¬ 
volved the lack of fire alarms for 
hearing-impaired residents. 
Catholic Charities took over a 
year to get the ADA-approved 


(Americans with Disabilities Act) 
fire alarms installed. Prior to that 
there was a fire at the facility, and 
some residents did not hear the 
alarms. 

Some residents are hopeful 
now that the previous program di¬ 
rector has left. Toni Young, the new 
acting program director has al¬ 
ready met with residents once and 
more meetings are planned, resi¬ 
dents said. Young said she’s work¬ 
ing to develop a 45-day plan and 
she hopes to actively involve the 
residents in fixing the problems. 

“One of the things we’re trying 
to do is support the tenants asso¬ 
ciation,” Young said. “We want to 
make it a home of residents and 
that’s what I’m trying to do.” ▼

26 BAY AREA REPORTER 18 June 1998 



The spike 


by Jim Provenzano 

j£ olleyball is certainly one of 
the more popular sports 
. among gay folk: it’s group- 
oriented; finding a space is rela¬ 
tively easy; we look great in 
shorts; and despite the velocity of 
those ESPN beach hunks spiking 
at 120 MPH, it is actually easy to 
play. 

Former volleyball jock Ken 
Posey is not competing, but is 
going to Gay Games with his 
boyfriend, Gary, who is. The long¬ 
time organizer for the local group 
of volleyball enthusiasts was piv¬ 
otal in creating Spike for Life, a 
successful annual AIDS fundrais¬ 
er. “We had done it with the AIDS 
Foundation,” he said. “But this 
year they were reluctant about us 
doing the fundraiser.” Perhaps 
SFAF finally realized, between yet 
another costly move and those 
bloated salaries, that they really do 
have too much money. Oops, 
wrong column. 

Anyway, last year, the volley- 


bailers changed their recipient to 
AIDS Benefits Counselors (ABC). 
The event grossed about $24,000 
for ABC last year. This year, sever¬ 
al facilities were not available, as 
they were resurfacing the floor or 
retrofitting gyms. Eureka Valley 
Rec. Center brilliantly de¬ 
cided to resurface their 
gym floor right before 
Gay Games, so several 
sports are without facilities 
for the next several weeks. 

Gay volleyball has 
grown by, well, leaps 
bounds, literally. 

NAGVA, the North 
American Gay Volley¬ 
ball Association, is the 
informal governing 
body of gay volleyball 
events. Throughout the year they 
run regional volleyball tourna¬ 
ments, and although some teams 
are competitive, Posey said that 
“pretty much anyone can apply.” 

A few years back, Posey added, 
“We didn’t have anything in SF so 
they started what was a very small 
tournament.” That’s grown from

last year’s, which was the largest, 
with 40 teams from Atlanta, 
Tampa, Vancouver, and the West 
Coast. 

Aside from NAGVA, Posey 
says, gay volleyball is an inclusive 
group. “Previously, with smaller 
teams, there was a more group 
feeling, though in 
the last few years, it’s 
larger, so each team is 
more on their own.” 

He’s a pepper 

Derrick Connolly, captain 
of the San Francisco 
Peppers, plays on Sun¬ 
days with his team. 
But don’t count on 
that for the next few 
weeks. He said they 
will have to move to a couple of 
other places for the next month of 
practices, and some team mem¬ 
bers are heading off to Europe 
early. 

Everyone hopes they’ll have 
time to re-group once they are in 
Amsterdam - but the 34-year-old 
Connolly is not too concerned. 
“We’ve played well together a lot. 
We know each other’s styles.” 

Connolly has played volleyball 
since seventh grade in Los Ange¬ 
les. As far as sports, for him, “vol¬ 
leyball was it. It was the only sport 
that was comfortable for us queer 
boys to play.” 

But with a strict Catholic up¬ 
bringing, he only Figured out 
many of his teammates were gay 
years later. “It was interesting how 
we did tend to group together.” 
Perhaps “gaydar” is innate, not 
learned. Hmm.

The SF Peppers spike a few at practice on their way to Gay Games V. 


Gay jock groupings with 
NAGVA are a more conscious act, 
with a tournament taking place al¬ 
most once a month. The Peppers 
try to attend as many as possible. 
“It depends on how far it is, if we 
can afford to go,” Connolly said. 

He hasn’t heard about the 
other competitors, but chances 
are other U.S. teams like Seattle 
will do well. A strong German 
contingent may also provide a lot 
of competition. 

But the focus for the Peppers is 
inclusion and fun, not who wins. 
Still, “it’s extremely strenuous,” 
Connolly said, adding that he 
“mostly plays for the exercise in a 
way that’s fun, when there’s a ball 
involved.” 

And despite his LA upbring¬ 
ing, he does not play the tougher 
two-on-two beach version. “Just 
indoors. I used to play growing up 
on the beach, but I’m not much of 
a sun person, with my Irish skin!” 

The team effort is also his pref¬ 
erence. “When you’re actually 
playing you have to concentrate. 
It’s a great way to take your mind 
off problems.” 

They also hang out together. 
“We enjoy each other’s company,” 
he said of their regular post-prac¬ 
tice treks to nearby Badlands. 


“Whenever we bring a new per¬ 
son in, we’re not a real cut-throat 
bunch, trying to reconfigure our 
team to get the best players. Some 
teams do that. We don’t. It’s a nice 
team.” 

Connolly also has some inside 
dish from Amsterdam. “One of 
our players moved to Amsterdam 
in March,” he said. “He says plans 
are going well, but it’s already a 
crowded city, and he doesn’t think 
they know what they’re getting 
into, or have a realistic idea of 
what it’ll be like with thousands of 
queens invading their city.” 

Probably no worse than Gay 
Day at Disneyland, but the rides 
will be different, as will the re¬ 
freshments! ▼ 


For more info on supporting the 
Peppers, call Derrick Connolly 
at (415) 863-4038. 

Another group that meets 
informally, and which 
competes, but will not be going 
to Gay Games, is Gay 
Volleyball, every Sunday 
between 11:30 and 3:30 in the 
school yard at 18th and DeHaro 
in the south of Market area.

GAY GAMES UP 


Hundreds of Christians 
intend to evangelize 
during Gay Games 

by Nellie Voss and Paul Van Yperen 


H undreds of Christian youths are expected in Amsterdam dur¬ 
ing Gay Games for a large evangelization campaign. The orga¬ 
nizers, Jeugd met een Boodschap (Youth With A Mission), de¬ 
nied that their aim is to convert homosexuals into heterosexual Chris¬ 
tians. A spokesperson in the Dutch magazine De Gay Krant said, “It 
is not because of the Gay Games. We campaign every summer.” 

Evangelizer Bert Dorenbosch tells in the Dutch daily De Gelder- 
lander a completely different story. The former boss of the Dutch 
Christian Television station EO says, “It is a perfect opportunity for 
us. I will participate in groups of prayers who have Gay Games on 
their agenda. I might also help spreading leaflets. Homosexuals do 
not live according to the Bible. Romans I and II are very clear about 
this. Relationships between men and men and women and women 
do not belong to the fruits of light. The Gay Games are contribut¬ 
ing to darkness in Amsterdam.” 

The Raad van Kerken (Council of Churches) in Amsterdam is 
distancing itself from the evangelization action. This council, to 
which twelve church communities belong, will organize an ecu¬ 
menical church service in honor of Gay Games on August 2 in the 
world famous Oude Kerk (Old Church). The Deacons of the Dutch 
Reformed Churches are financially supporting this service. The 
combined Dutch lesbian and gay religious groups are organizing a 
“light center” during Gay Games. This center provides participants 
and visitors the opportunity for reflection and rest in a “light 
room.” Gay men and lesbian women from different religions and 
traditions, such as Buddhistic, Islamitic, Jewish, Catholic and 
Protestant, are there to talk with visitors. T

Contra Costa Rainbow Center to honor 
Margaret Walker next Friday night 


by Terrance Boykin 


he Rainbow Community 
Center of Contra Costa 
County (RCC) will honor 
Margaret Walker, health educator 
and public speaker on human 
sexuality and HIV testing, on Fri¬ 
day, June 26. Members and the 
board of directors of RCC are 
sponsoring the second annual 
event at the Sheraton Concord 
Hotel. The evening begins at 7 
p.m, with a silent auction, raffle, 
and a rainbow souvenir table. 

Currently a consultant on 
human sexuality and HIV health 
services, Walker’s efforts continue 
to empower gay/lesbians/bisexual 
and transgender people to fight 
against bigotry in their communi¬ 
ty. Originally from Yorkshire, 
England, she settled in Northern 
California in the late eighties. 
Continuing work she performed 
in the U.K. as a HIV/AIDS and 
suicide-related crisis counselor, 
she was hired to build up the vol¬ 
unteer staff at the Pacific Center 
in Berkeley. 

While fielding calls from all 
over the country for the Pacific 
Center crisis line, she became con¬ 
cerned about the high volume of 
calls from the underserved queer 
community in Contra Costa 
County. In her charming British 
accent she told the Bay Area Re¬ 
porter, “There was a definite need 
for some grass roots support in 
the area. The area was just over the 
hill, but for young Jesbian/gays/bi- 
sexual and transgender people 
there was a huge barrier.” 

Walker applied for a small 


grant, which she obtained from 
United Way, and pioneered the Pa¬ 
cific Center satellite office in Wal¬ 
nut Creek. In 1991, through the of¬ 
fice she began networking with al¬ 
ready existing organizations in the 
area such as Parents and Friends of 
Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), the 
Bay Area Network of Gay and Les¬ 
bian Educators (BANGLE), and 
the owners of gay bars. 

Described as confident, opti¬ 
mistic, and unafraid of the criti¬ 
cism that she would ultimately 
face in the Republican, sleeping 
bedroom community, Jon Crovo, 
owner of Club 1220 in Walnut 
Creek and board member of RCC 
said, “she was the first to come 
into this community and intro¬ 
duce herself as an open lesbian. 
Margaret breaks down every 
stereotype, she’s very friendly and 
warm, like a grandmother. People 
who you never thought would pay 
attention, listened to what she had 
to say.” 

Risking censure, Walker held 
forums of dialogue at high 
schools, churches, and universi¬ 
ties. Within two years, the GLBT 
community began to strengthen, 
with the formation of youth 
groups, lesbian coming out, and 
men’s support and discussion 
groups. Through her efforts as co¬ 
chair of the Contra Costa 
HIV/AIDS Consortium, she was 
able to coordinate services with 
the county’s Department of 
Health Services, local hospitals, 
and related nonprofit agencies. 
From 1992 through 1996, as a 
member of the consortium’s Ed¬ 
ucation and Prevention Commit¬ 
tee, she developed “training for 


Gay Santa Rosa lawyer 
hosting hate crimes 
forum on Wednesday 


by Cynthia Laird 


’? onoma County law en¬ 
forcement officials will be 
y on hand at a forum in 
Santa Rosa this Wednesday, June 
24 to address the North Bay’s 
growing hate crimes problems. 
Openly gay Santa Rosa attorney 
Michael A. Fiumara, president of 
the Santa Rosa Democratic Club 
and a nationally acclaimed body¬ 
builder, organized the forum. 

Fiumara said that Sonoma 
County Sheriff Jim Piccinini is 
slated to attend the forum. Pic¬ 
cinini recently appointed a 24- 
year veteran of the sheriff’s de¬ 
partment, Lieutenant Chuck 
Laver, as the department’s first li¬ 
aison to the gay and lesbian com¬ 
munity. The historic move came 
in response to a rash of alleged 
hate crimes perpetrated against 
gay men in Guerneville and at 
the Russian River, as well as al¬ 
leged rapes of lesbian victims in 
Sebastopol. 

Sonoma County District At¬ 
torney Michael J. Mullins is also 
expected to attend the forum, Fi¬ 
umara said. Mullins has already 
stated he will prosecute all hate 
crimes in the county, he added. 

Fiumara is a civil rights and 
criminal defense lawyer who has 
previously represented several 
young men who were savagely 


attacked and beaten merely be¬ 
cause they are gay. He urged all 
gay and lesbian Sonoma County 
residents to attend the forum to 
let their views be known. 

Additionally, it is Fiumara’s 
opinion that the Santa Rosa De¬ 
mocratic Party, the so-called 
“party of homosexuals,” accord¬ 
ing to the radical right, will be a 
supportive link to victims of gay 
and lesbian hate crimes at the 
state level. The county has a 
higher number of Democrats 
than Republicans registered to 
vote. “It is thus fortunate to have 
elected [state] Senator Mike 
Thompson, who has been very 
supportive of gay and lesbian 
rights, and the very popular, 
two-term Sonoma County As¬ 
semblywoman Valerie Brown,” 
said Fiumara. 

The forum is free to the gen¬ 
eral public. Those who wish to 
attend a catered buffet before¬ 
hand should arrive at 6:30 p.m.; 
the cost for the dinner is $8 per 
person for adults, and $6 for stu¬ 
dents and senior citizens. ▼ 


The forum starts at 7:30 p.m. 
at the Veterans Memorial 
Building, 1351 Maple Avenue, 
across the street from the 
county fairgrounds. For more 
information, call Michael 
Fiumara at (707) 571-8600. 



trainers” based on the latest CDC 
data, to educate volunteers on 
HIV prevention and awareness, 
self esteem, and sexually trans¬ 
mitted diseases. 


The honor award is in recogni¬ 
tion of Walker’s decade of service 
to a community sadly lacking in 
acceptance and support. “Her in¬ 
fectious enthusiasm is what 


pulled in so many volunteers. She 
has been so consistently dedicat¬ 
ed, in spite of setbacks.” said 
Melitta Rorty, fellow board mem¬ 
ber of RCC. 

Tickets for the celebration and 
fundraiser are $65 for RCC mem¬ 
bers and $75 for nonmembers. 
Among the auction and raffle 
prizes are a trip to Seattle on Alas¬ 
ka Airlines, a three-night stay at a 
local bed and breakfast, a dinner 
for two at Scott’s Seafood Restau¬ 
rant, which include an evening at 
the theatre and a night’s stay at the 
Concord Hilton Hotel. 

Walker is one of the founding 
board members of RCC in Con¬ 
tra Costa County. Concerning 
the future of the queer move¬ 
ment, Walker told the B.A.R, “I’m 
very optimistic and I think the 
younger generation is doing 
great, but it’s still a struggle for 
them. We have made great 
strides, but with the doom and 
gloom of the religious right, we 
still have a long way to go in this 
country.” Regarding laws that en¬ 
sure basic freedoms for lesbians 
and gays, she said, “At the end of 
the day, we are all still minorities, 
and the most hated segment in 
society.” ▼

1998 san francisco lesbian & gay film festival special 



T | here are encouraging signs in this year’s 
San Francisco International Lesbian and 
Gay Film Festival (SFILGFF) that the 
ghetto is losing its grip. Many of the pro¬ 
grams, both features (51) and shorts (230), resist 
easy pigeonholing, with the happy implication 
that the queer community’s long-standing obses¬ 
sion with roles and labels may be starting to 
loosen up. 

Breaking down the films into categories proved 
surprisingly difficult. For one thing, just as in real 
life, many of the characters in these works — fic¬ 
tional, real, or reconstructed — don’t fit a precise, 
undeviating profile. In Totally Confused, for ex¬ 
ample, the resolutely straight male lead sleeps with 
his gay best friend in order to salvage their friend¬ 
ship. The Brandon Teena Story shows how two 
identities — biological male and self-constructed 
female — can coexist, if torturously in this case, 
in one body. The title character in Vera, in defi¬ 
ance of biology and social strictures, demands the 
world acknowledge her as male. Many of the fes¬ 
tival’s signature films this year — High Art, The 
Sticky Fingers of Time, Relax ... It’s Just Sex —have 
strong pansexual aspects, and some, like the 
raunchy short Pansexual Public Porn, follow the 
sexual implications of polymorphous perversity 
to the far fringes. 

Moving away from the monolith of identity 
politics makes i^pasier to survey the films in this 
festival for their aesthetic achievement, entertain-

\ he choice of Lisa Cholodenko’s High Art 
to open the San Francisco International 
Lesbian & Gay Film Festival is going to 
annoy some people, namely any ticket¬ 
holding clean ’n’ sober dykes in the market for 
some self-image enhancement. Addictive person¬ 
alities more at peace with their Dionysian procliv¬ 
ities will find this trendy heroin-laced tragedy a 
highly watchable meditation on the yin-yangs of 
art ’n’ commerce, sex ’n’ drugs, and love ’n’ death. 

Top-billed Ally Sheedy plays antiheroine Lucy 
Berliner, a New York hipster junkie art photogra¬ 
pher who walked away from success ten years be¬ 
fore and is now lolling around an incredibly spa¬ 
cious apartment in drug-induced apathy. The 
scrawny, sour-puss butch is psychically overpow¬ 
ered by a rich bitch Jewish mother (Tammy 
Grimes) and a hophead German girlfriend, Greta 
(Patricia Clarkson). Both these significant others 
are strawberry blonde narcissists with a leech-like 
talent for clinging to, and sucking the vital energy 
from, their shared love object. 

For all her thin-lipped crankiness, Sheedy de¬ 
livers the film’s most complex and compelling per¬ 
formance, locating the mysterious nexus of expe¬ 
rience, reflection, and technique from which in¬ 
spiration springs. She also establishes a real dyke 
archetype: the touchy, twitchy, sullen androgyne 
only a femme (or a mother) could love. 

In a cameo that’s kind of a clunker, Tammy

: : y the time this weeks ish is 

: in the news racks (while 
• l: there still ore news racks), 
the 22nd San Francisco Interna¬ 
tional Lesbian & Gay Film Festi¬ 
val will be unleashed upon the 
general populace. From the 
Opening Night festivities sur¬ 
rounding the screening of Lisa 
Cholodenko’s High Art to the 
Closing Night feature, P. J. 
Castellaneta’s Relax... It’s 
Just Sex (but how can we 
relax when you have 
your tripod up our 
aperture?), our film re¬ 
viewers, social butter¬ 
flies, and shutterbugs 
will be covering the Fes¬ 
tival every frame of 
the way. Watch this 
space for the kind 
of greasy footage 
that usually winds 
up on the cutting-room floor. 

One of the Festivals featured 
films almost didn’t make it to the 
screen because of rampant homo¬ 
phobia and narrow-mindedness 
at two of Tinseltown’s biggest film 
labs. Festival director Michael 
Lumpkin told us the tale of inde¬ 
pendent film Hard and its hard¬ 
ships in post-production. Seems 
that when indie-film veterans 
John Huckert and John 
Matkowsky took their movie 
about a gay serial killer and a clos¬ 
eted gay cop to Deluxe Holly¬ 
wood, the nation’s largest film lab, 
a man named Steve Jackson 
told them, “We can no longer 
work on your film. It is porno¬ 
graphic, and we do not work on 
pornographic films.” Jackson 
claimed that some of the lab

workers were spooked by scenes 
of men kissing, and exclaimed, 
“There are women who work 
here!” Such tender flowers! 

The filmmakers’ second 
choice, Technicolor, also refused 
to make prints of Hard. In true 
Hollywood fashion (spineless), 
one Technicolor employee told 
Huckert, “Forget it. If Deluxe 
won’t do it, we won’t do it.” 

Fortunately, Huckert and 
Matkowsky eventually found a 
film lab with technicians whose 
delicate sensibilities 
weren’t violated by their 
thriller’s subject mat¬ 
ter. Look, we’re not 
saying Hard is a po¬ 
tential Citizen Kane 
or anything. And from 
what we can glean 
from the advance mate¬ 
rials and a glimpse at 
a clip, its scenes of 
graphic violence, 
not to mention its 
very premise 
(here’s a new idea: homo serial 
killer!) turn us all the way off. But 
that doesn’t mean some prudish 
lily-livered straight film-wonk 
morons get to censor what’s avail¬ 
able to us queers for display up on 
the Silver Screen. We’d almost say 
these lab technicians’ having to 
live in L.A. is punishment enough. 
But certainly no queer filmmies 
ought to patronize either Deluxe 
Hollywood or Technicolor for the 
foreseeable future. 

Flower power 

By all accounts, the June wed¬ 
ding of Kathy Fenker and Larry 
Mullens was an affair to remem¬ 
ber. This blessed union has been a 
red-letter date on the underground 
art-scene calendar ever since 
Fenker, of Enrique fame, and 
Mullens, drummer for Iggy Pop’s 
band, announced their intended 
betrothal. The nuptials, in the regal 
Green Room of the War Memori¬ 
al, were a phosphorescent vision in 
bright fuchsia pink, pink being the 
color of the bridesmaids’ dresses. 
By bridesmaids we mean Jason 
and D’Arcy of Enrique, as well as 
the bride’s two biological sisters. 
The bride was dressed in white, 
with sequins and veil — “She was 
flawless,” says our eyewitness. “In a 
room full of people dressed to the 
nines, she was a ten.” 

The groom was something to 
see as well, in hot pink tux, tails, 
and top hat. A member of the 
wedding party saw fit to wear a 
tutu... and nothing else. The band 
played Bolero. Ravel rolled over. 



Ggreg Taylor 


The high suspense of who 
would catch the bride’s bouquet 
turned quickly into horror when, 
amid a forest of girly pink sleeves 
flailing about, the bundle of fleurs 
was soundly snatched by Ggreg 
Taylor in his favored Scary Clown 
drag. An unsettling sight indeed, 
especially if you’re a young girl 
hoping to catch the floral missile. 
Even if you’re not that young, and 
even if you’re not a girl. 

West of Eden 

There we were at a press lun¬ 
cheon at Elroy’s, a new combina¬ 
tion pool hall/yuppie restau¬ 
rant/watering hole in what was 
once a warehouse at Beale and 
Folsom. The kind folks from the 
West Hollywood Convention & 
Visitors Bureau were treating, and 
they were full of boasts about 
their 1.9-square mile city in the 
middle of Los Angeles, which en¬ 
compasses Wolfgang Puck’s 
Spago Beverly Hills (go figure), 
the humongous Pacific Design 
Center (aka “The Blue Whale”), 
and about a trillion antique 
shops, galleries, and chic little 
spots. Quite a queer little fiefdom: 
little wonder one in three resi¬ 
dents is gay. There are the peren¬ 
nial WeHo gay clubs — Revolver, 
Rage, Mickey’s — and the rock ’n’ 
roll clubs on the Sunset Strip like 
the Viper Room, site of River 
Phoenix’s untimely death. You 
might like to know the club in the 
Viper’s space was once known as 
Filthy McNasty’s. 

We were more interested in 
chatting with reps from the ho¬ 
tels, such as Ian Schrager’s de- 
signed-to-the-teeth Mondrian on 
Sunset. We learned quite a few 
trade secrets, including that the 
Hyatt West Hollywood is home to 
gay rock ’n’ roll legend Little

'Danny Scheie's Traffic School' 

Dangerous curves 


by Richard Dodds 


Hp' he English language hasn’t 
yet devised a word that could 
sum up Danny Scheie’s new 
one-man show. Not even a neck¬ 
lace of adjectives would make a 
dent in describing what Scheie has 
wrought at Josie’s Cabaret. 

The official name of the 60- 
minute production is Danny 
Scheie's Traffic School, but that 
doesn’t help much. The detours 
from that concept are so numer¬ 
ous and severe that the title could 
as easily be Danny Scheie’s Egg¬ 
plant Lasagna, or Danny Scheie’s I 
Hate Audrey Hepburn Fan Club. 

Actually, that last title is getting 
closer to the meat of the matter. 
At one point, with no transition 
that I could discern, Scheie was off 
on a riff about the biggest evil ever 
visited on mankind. It was when 
that “lip-synching, part-stealing 
UNICEF Nazi” Audrey Hepburn 
got the role in My Fair Lady that 
belonged to Julie Andrews. This 
somehow evolved into a tribute to 
Mary Martin, Cole Porter, and 
NAMBLA, with Scheie, stripped 
down to revealing leotards, bark¬ 
ing out a down-and-dirty version 


of My Heart Belongs to Daddy. 

Other topics include that “self¬ 
ish hag” Mother Teresa, the sum¬ 
mer Shakespeare racket, and het¬ 
erosexuals. Indeed, Scheie is on a 
mission to skewer straight preten¬ 
sions, hang-ups and inadequacies, 
with just enough over-the-top 
outrageousness to keep it in the 
company of comedy. 

Scheie has built up a consider¬ 
able reputation as an accom¬ 
plished director and versatile per¬ 
former, and his credits range from 
Picnic in Marin to The Last Hair¬ 
dresser at Theatre Rhino. For Traf¬ 
fic School, Scheie turned over the 
direction to Mark Rucker, who re¬ 
cently directed The Birds at Berke¬ 
ley Rep. But there is nothing 
mainstream or slick about this 
collaboration, which maintains 
energy over its uneven journey by 
its unpredictable edginess. 

Musical accompaniment is by 
Don Seaver, who winds up in a 
jockstrap by the end of the show. 
Don’t ask. T 


Danny Sheie’s Traffic School 
will run at Josie’s Cabaret 
through June 21. Tickets are 
$10 and $12. Call 861-7933. 


| | he last thing the world 
needs,” says a character in 
Last Sunday in June, “is an¬ 
other faggoty one-man show.” But 
Leon Acord, the author and star of 
the new one-man show, puts these 
potentially incriminating words 
in the mouth of a particularly un- 
likable character. 

That character is a self-ab¬ 
sorbed, deeply closeted soap 
opera star who takes sanctuary 
from “Fag Pride Week” in a down¬ 
town San Francisco hotel bar. The 
other main character through 
whom we experience Pride Day 
events is also something an out¬ 
sider: a Middle-America mother 
trying to come to terms with her 
son’s sexuality. 

In fact, even the gay characters 
that Acord depicts are out of step 
with the parade. One is a pregnant 
lesbian marching with a tiny anti- 


Leon Acord 


abortion contingent. Another is a 
man tired of living with AIDS who 
has missed the parade completely 
as he prepares to kill himself.

ACT Artistic Director Carey Perloff with Harold Pinter in New York in 1988. 


ACT's Carey Perloff on Pinter 

No labels, please 


by Richard Dodds 


laywright Harold Pinter, 

i- whose affairs with women 
have made headlines, is ob¬ 
viously straight, right? “He would 
laugh to hear you say that,” said 
Carey Perloff, artistic director of 
American Conservatory Theater, 
who knows Pinter personally and 
his works intimately. “He’s so sus¬ 
picious of any labeling.” 

However, Perloff did label the 
Pinter plays she chose to close out 
ACT’s season as his “most homo¬ 
erotic works.” Perloff is directing 
Old Times at the Geary Theater, 
while The Collection is being pre¬ 
sented on a bill with The Lovers at 
New Langton Arts by ACT’s 
M.F.A. program. 

“I always wanted to do them 
together,” Perloff said during a re¬ 
cent interview. “I think doing that 
will shed an interesting light on 
the plays.” 

In Old Times, first staged in 
1971, a married couple is visited 
by a female friend from the past 
whom the husband now suspects 
was something more than just a 
friend, and whose presence sud¬ 
denly creates plays for power in 
this new triangle. In The Collec¬ 
tion, which dates back to 1962, it’s 
more of a rectangle, as a husband 
tries to determine if his wife had a 
fling with a man who appears to 
be coupled with another man. 

“Pinter recognizes that all rela¬ 
tionships are sexual in some way,” 
Perloff said, “and all relationships 
are about power. I don’t think he 
cares about passing judgment on 
sexuality.” 

But according to Perloff, Pinter 
was horrified by a production of 
Old Times directed by Luchino 
Visconti in which a lesbian rela¬ 
tionship was explicitly depicted. 
“The play needs to be about shift¬ 
ing sands,” Perloff said. “For Dee- 
ley [the suspicious husband in Old 
Times], the suggestion that some¬ 
thing happened is more upsetting 
than if it were labeled. Most plays 
try to neatly sum up a relationship 
in a kind of therapy for the audi¬ 
ence. For Pinter, reality is much 
more complex than that.” 

Gay appeal 

Perloff said she chose Old Times 


as her first Pinter play at ACT at 
least partly to appeal to the gay and 
lesbian audiences that she has been 
courting since taking over the 
artistic reins in 1992. “When I first 
came here, the theater didn’t have 
any connection to the gay commu¬ 
nity,” she said. “I have a lot of 
neighbors who are gay, and they 
said to me,‘Why are you doing An¬ 
gels in America when ACT is 
known as a homophobic theater?’ 
I’ve worked very hard on that.” 

But because she knows many 
theatergoers are wary of Pinter, 
Perloff also chose Old Times be¬ 
cause she considers it one of his 
most accessible plays. “Somehow,” 
she said, “American productions 
of his work have led people to be¬ 
lieve he is incomprehensible. But 
there is nothing to get. It is life 
being experienced. People don’t 
need to be afraid.” 

Perloff is not afraid of Pinter, 
but she admitted she was 
“awestruck” when she met the 
playwright during her tenure as 


the artistic director of the Classic 
Stage Company in New York. 
“This is the writer who made me 
want to be in theater,” she said. 
“He is a complex, fascinating and 
intimidating man.” 

Although she has had numer¬ 
ous conversations with Pinter, 
Perloff said, “I wouldn’t presume 
to guess his sexuality.” But she did 
note that Pinter “is attracted to 
strong and powerful friends, and I 
think he has had very close bonds 
with men that have had an erotic 
component, or he wouldn’t be 
able to tap into that for these 
characters. They don’t feel like 
types, and something in him lets 
him understand them.” ▼ 


Old Times will run at the Geary 
Theater through July 12. 
Tickets are $14-$51. The 
Collection and The Lover will 
run at New Langton Arts 
through June 20. Tickets are 
$10. Call 749-2228.

cisco Queer Arts Festival, 
which this week continues

Michael Alig:'Party Monster' 

Totally fucked up 


by Robert Julian 


' ichael Alig’s life is the 
worst-case scenario envi¬ 
sioned by every homo- 
phobic parent with a gay son. Alig 
did it all: sex, drugs, cross-dress¬ 
ing, wild parties, and eventually 
murder. Party Monster, Fenton 
Bailey and Randy Barbato’s docu¬ 
mentary about the rise and fall of 
Manhattan’s premier “Club Kid,” 
is an engrossing, disturbing, and 
vaguely terrifying film. Young 
queers whose aspirations to fabu¬ 
lousness lead them to drug abuse 
and disco could use this film as 
aversion therapy. 

Anthony Haden-Guest in his 
1997 release, Last Party, details the 
meteoric rise of Studio 54 and the 
subsequent death of the Manhat¬ 
tan disco scene. Near the end of 
his book, Haden-Guest mentions 
Michael Alig and his very young 
cohorts as the crowd that inherit¬ 
ed what was left of the Manhattan 


as a busboy, and started to party. 
Alig’s prelude to murder were sev¬ 
eral years of drug-induced nights 
at Danceteria and Limelight. 

Before and after 

Filmmakers Bailey and Barbato 
conduct a lengthy videotape inter¬ 
view with Alig three months be¬ 
fore his arrest for murder; they 
also interview him in prison after 
his arrest. In addition, Party Mon¬ 
ster incorporates video footage of 
Alig doing drugs at home, party¬ 
ing at the discos, or hosting the 
popular “outlaw parties” he would 
throw in public places like subway 
stations or the McDonalds in 
Times Square. Stills, interviews, 
and outtakes from Club Kids’ ap¬ 
pearances on television talk shows 
round out the cinematic palate ef¬ 
fectively employed by Bailey and 
Barbato. Quick cuts, homemade 
titles, and house music add to the 
appropriately chaotic, out-of-con¬ 
trol tone of Party Monster. Then, 
of course, there is the murder. 


Regarding his roommate Angel, 
Alig casually remarks, “He was a 
copycat, and so we killed him. He 
was one of those copycats that we 
hate. I killed Angel _ ” 


club scene in the mid ’80s and 
killed it (in this case, both literal¬ 
ly and figuratively). With the 
megadiscos gone, the bridge-and- 
tunnel crowd could no longer 
hope for a glimpse of Liza, Hal- 
ston, Mick, or Bianca as they 
tripped the light fantastic until 
the wee hours of the morning. 
Enter the Club Kids. They were 
the self-invented latter-day court 
jesters, a group of trendy misfits 
who gravitated to the Manhattan 
club scene from the hinterlands of 
America. Their wildly costumed 
sideshow kept the crowd amused, 
and the few remaining venues 
packed — at least for a while. 
Apres Alig, le deluge. 

In her Party Monster interview, 
Alig’s mother traces the emer¬ 
gence of Michael’s larcenous side 
back to grade school. Every day 
after school, he would make his 
mother take him to discount 
houses, where he would buy 
candy bars, five for a dollar. He 
would take them home and mark 
them up to a dollar each, stuff 
them into a shoebox, and re-sell 
them the next day at school. He 
became known as the “candy 
man” until the school principal 
made him shut down his resale 
business. But the seeds of a suc¬ 
cessful scam artist were already 
sown when this Midwestern boy 
headed for the Big Apple, got a job 


In his pre-arrest video inter¬ 
view, Alig is cute in a Dennis the 
Menace meets David Cassidy sort 
of way. Small and thin (heroin 
will keep you that way), Alig af¬ 
fects lots of eye shadow and glit¬ 
ter, and presents himself in a dis¬ 
turbingly familiar, silly gayboy 
manner. Regarding his former 
roommate and drug dealer, Angel 
Melendez, Alig casually remarks, 
“He was a copycat, and so we 
killed him. He was one of those 
copycats that we hate. I killed 
Angel....” Then Alig stops himself 
and tosses off the half-hearted ex¬ 
planation that his flippant confes¬ 
sion was just one of those things 
that always gets him in trouble. 
Shortly after this interview, Alig 
was arrested for the murder of 
Melendez, whose dismembered 
body was found floating in a box 
in the East River. 

Producer/directors Randy Bar¬ 
bato and Fenton Bailey are also 
responsible for RuPaul’s sensa¬ 
tional debut video, Supermodel, 
and the treacly Drop Dead Gor¬ 
geous, an HBO documentary on 
the unfunny HIV-positive come¬ 
dian Steve Moore that played last 
year at the SF Gay/Lesbian Film 
Fest. But with Party Monster, it 
seems Barbato and Bailey have 
struck gold. They have written the 
script for a feature-length pro¬ 
duction of Michael Alig’s story

ing those we never see, are some¬ 
how connected, at times in unex¬

pealing qualities of Acord’s ambi¬

Acord is a versatile and per¬ 
sonable performer, but not quite 
the expert chameleon that can 
bring a succession of characters to 
uncanny life. If he were, it would 


help the script when it doesn’t 
ring so true or when it does ring 
too familiarly. 

Near the end of the 75-minute

Expendable 

The life and death of Brandon Teena 



by Robert Julian 


Ithough taken from life, 
Jg,J|. The Brandon Teena Story 
has antecedents in both 
Greek tragedy and carnival 
sideshows. It is a simple story, 
maddeningly cliche in its pre¬ 
dictability. In 1993, a young man 
who describes himself to others as 
a “hermaphrodite” or as having a 
“sexual identity crisis” attempts to 
create a life for himself in rural 
Nebraska. For his efforts, he is re¬ 
warded with ridicule, humilia¬ 
tion, rape, and ultimately death. 
Documentary filmmakers Susan 
Muska and Greta Olafsdottir em¬ 
ploy simple, straightforward sto¬ 
rytelling that highlights the in¬ 
credible melancholy of Brandon 
Teena’s short life. 

The efforts of Muska and 
Olafsdottir are somewhat ham¬ 
pered by their lack of live-action 
footage of Brandon. Their film 
relies primarily on videotaped 
interviews with Brandon’s 
friends and family, the local po¬ 
lice, and Brandon’s murderers. 
But still photographs of Brandon 
as the young Teena, as well as an 
audiotape interview with Bran¬ 
don shortly after his rape, illus¬ 
trate the tragic circumstances 
under which an individual is 
robbed of self-respect, individu¬ 
ality, and life. 

Born and raised as female, 
Teena Brandon later adopts Bran¬ 
don Teena as her male identity. 
Brandon’s teen years involve 
enough persecution that he leaves 
his family in Lincoln and heads 
south for the small Nebraska 
town of Falls City, which would 
become his undoing. Unfortu¬ 
nately, Brandon arrives with a 
record of arrests for petty larceny 
(primarily for kiting bad checks) 
and a reputation as quite a ladies’ 
man. In fact, his ambiguous geni¬ 
talia did not seem to diminish his 
success with women. Many of 
them testify that “Brandon knew 
how to please a woman.” He was, 


by all accounts, an aggressive, ten¬ 
der, conscientious, and attentive 
lover whose intersex status did 
not matter to most of the women 
he pursued. In fact, there is very 
little clarity among his lovers on 
the status of his gender transi¬ 
tioning. One woman says that he 
had breasts removed and some 
former lovers explain that they 
never saw his genitalia. The men 
who rape Brandon testify to the 
presence of a vagina. 

In the depressed rural town of 
Falls City, the handsome Brandon 
gets heavily involved with Lana, 
but when her former boyfriend 
John Lotter and his friend Tom 
Nissen find out Brandon’s secret, 
they kidnap and rape him. When 
Brandon tries to press rape 
charges, his intersex status and 
his past encounters with the law 
in Lincoln cause the police to dis¬ 
miss his allegations. The perpe¬ 
trators of the crime, despite pre¬ 
vious criminal records, are simply 
interviewed and released, but 
they soon come back to perma¬ 
nently silence their accuser. In the 
process, they murder two equally 
innocent bystanders as well. 

Although Muska and Olafs- 


dottir’s film may seem to be about 
gender issues, it informs more 
universal themes. What is the 
price of being different? What is 
the obligation of society to those 
who do not conform to sex role 
stereotypes? What is the perceived 
(or actual) connection between 
homosexuality and gender issues? 
The filmmakers wisely raise these 
questions by induction, and elicit 
some revealing responses through 
thoughtful questioning of their 
subjects, particularly the local po¬ 
lice. Except for the presence of the 
always-insufferable Kate Born- 
stein, the filmmakers keep the 
level of discourse on a dispassion¬ 
ate level, which only adds to the 
overwhelming sadness of The 
Brandon Teena Story. It is some¬ 
how strangely unsatisfying to 
learn that the two murderers were 
both convicted and that one 
awaits the electric chair. Justice, in 
the face of such a heinous triple 
murder, is a concept impossible to 
contemplate. ▼

PUT SOME 

FREEDOM INTO 

YOUR Obi 

MEDICATION 

SCHEDULE 


It takes strong medicines to fight HIV. But your 
medicines also have to be easy to take. That's 
why many people now take ZERIT (also known 
as d4T) as part of their HIV therapy. 

Most people tolerate ZERIT quite well. You take 
just one capsule twice a day with or without 
food. And you can combine ZERIT with most 
other medicines you might be taking. 

ZERIT is approved for the treatment of HIV- 
infected persons who have already received 
prolonged AZT therapy. However, there is no 
cure for HIV infection. People taking ZERIT 
may still develop infections or other conditions 
associated with HIV. Please note that all HIV 
drugs cause side effects. ZERIT has been shown 
to cause tingling or pain in the hands or feet in 
13% to 24% of people.

'Queer Cartoons II' 


Superqueers and dollfaces 



by Gary Morris 


... artoons have always been a 
rich repository of <^ueer 
. subtext. How else to explain 
all those too-close buddies and 
their serious lack of female com¬ 
panionship? (The big joke about 
Superman is that he’s more de¬ 
voted to his “pal” Jimmy Olsen 
than to poor, frustrated Lois 
Lane.) Then there’s the endless 
parade of children without par¬ 
ents or with questionable origins 

— who exactly is Swee’ Pea’s 
mother in those Popeye cartoons? 
Or his father, for that matter? 
And what about all those car¬ 
toons where the adults — parents 

— appear only in fragmented 
form, unseen past the knee? You’d 
almost think heterosexual repro¬ 
duction didn’t exist. 

Since cartoons are well-posi¬ 
tioned to ridicule and even repu¬ 
diate hetero norms, the idea of 


“queer cartoons” seems almost re¬ 
dundant. Why bother, when the 
mainstream culture offers with¬ 
out blinking a pair of “super¬ 
heroes” like Batman and Robin 
living happily in what looks like a 
homo marriage? Because drag¬ 
ging subtext to the surface can be 
fun, as this year’s exceptional 
Queer Cartoons II program shows. 

The program opens with a su¬ 
perb send-up of the trashy ’60s 
superhero cartoon. The Ambigu¬ 
ously Gay Duo, directed by J.J. 
Sedelmaier, are “Ace” and “Gary,” 
two muscular costumed queen 
crime-fighters who drive a giant 
pink dickmobile. In the first 
episode, “Queen of Terror,” the 
two battle an evil space seductress 
who fails to get a rise from the 
boys. In a brilliant touch, Sedel¬ 
maier lays a laugh track over the 
show that erupts into hysterics 
whenever Ace pats Gary on the 
ass with a “Well done!” or the po¬ 
lice commissioner makes a lewd

Briet Summary of Prescribing Information, 10/96 For complete 
prescribing information, please consult official package circular. 

INDICATIONS AND USAGE 

ZERIT (stavudine) Is Indicated lor the treatment ol HIV-Intected 
patients who have received prolonged prior zidovudine therapy. 

The duration of clinical benelit from antiretroviral therapy 
may be limited. Alteration in antiretroviral therapy should be 
considered If disease progression occurs while receiving ZERIT. 
CLINICAL STUDIES 

Study AI45S-0I9 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial 
of ZERIT Capsules vs ndovudme for the treatment of HIV-infected adults 
with CD4 counts of 50 to 500 cells/mm‘ who had received at least six 
months prior zidovudine treatment. ZERIT was administered in 
dosages of 40 mg BID for patients weighing 260 kg, and 30 mg BID 
for those weighing <60 kg. The zidovudine dosage was 200 mg TID 
The study enrolled 822 patients with a median baseline CD4 count 
of 235 cel!s/mm J (range: 10 to 735 cells/mm’l, and a median du¬ 
ration of prior zidovudine treatment of 88 weeks (range-11 to 356 
weeks). Fourteen percent of subjects had AIDS at baseline, 50% 
had HIV-related symptoms and 36% were asymptomatic. 

Table 1 gives the Kaplan-Meier estimates for the time to disease 
progression,

24 mon ths 26.6% 31.8% 

" Kaplan-Meier estimates: the overall difference between 
stavudine and zidovudine was not significant. 


CONTRAINDICATIONS 

ZERIT is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hy¬ 
persensitivity to stavudine or to any of the components contained 
in the formulation 

WARNINGS 

The ma|or clinical toxicity of ZERIT Is peripheral neuropathy. 
This complication occurred In 19 and 24 percent ot the 11,784 pa¬ 
tients with advanced HIV disease who received the two dose lev¬ 
els of stavudine In the Parallel Track Program 1 . In patients with 
less advanced HIV inlection in the zidovudine comparative trial, 
peripheral neuropathy occurred in 13 percent ot ZERIT-treated 
. patients as compared to 4 percent of zidovudine-treated patients. 

Patients should be monitored lor the development of neuropa¬ 
thy that Is usually characterized by numbness, tingling, or pain In 
the laet or hands. Stavudlne-related peripheral neuropathy may re¬ 
solve If therapy Is withdrawn promptly. In some cases, symptoms 
may worsen temporarily following discontinuation ol therapy. H 
symptoms resolve completely, resumption of treatment may he 
considered at a reduced dose. 

Patients with a history of peripheral neuropathy are at In¬ 
creased risk for the development of neuropathy, ll stavudine 
must be administered in this clinical setting, carelul monitoring 
is essential. 

PRECAUTIONS 
Information lor Patients 

Patients should be informed that ZERIT is not a cure for HIV infec¬ 
tion, and that they may continue to acquire illnesses associated with 
HIV infection, including opportunistic infections. Patients should be 
advised to remain under the care ot a physician when using ZERIT. 

Patients should be informed that the most common toxicity of 
ZERIT is peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms of peripheral neuropa¬ 
thy usually include tingling, burning, pain, or numbness in the 
hands or feet. Patients should be counseled that this toxicity occurs 
with greater frequency in patients with a history of peripheral neu¬ 
ropathy. They should be advised that these symptoms should be re¬ 
ported to their physicians and that dnse changes may be necessary. 
They should also be cautioned about the use of other medications 
that may exacerbate peripheral neuropathy. 

Caregivers of young children receiving ZERIT therapy should be in¬ 
structed regarding detecbon and reporting of peripheral neuropathy 

Patients should be informed that the long-term effects of ZERIT 
are unknown at this time. They should be advised that ZERIT thera¬ 
py has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV to 
others through sexual contact or blood contamination. 

Patients should be informed that the Center for Disease Control 
(CDC) recommends that HIV-infected mothers not nurse newborn in¬ 
fants to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV infection. 
Laboratory Texts 

MM to moderate increases in AST (SG0T) and ALT (SGPT) occurred com¬ 
monly in clinical trials, these did not interfere with continued therapy. 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis. Impairment of Fertility 
Long-term carcinogenicity studies of stavudine in animals have not 
been completed. Stavudine was not mutagenic in the Ames, £ coli 
reverse mutation, or the CH0/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene 
mutation assays, with and without metabolic activation. Stavudine pro¬ 
duced positive results in the in vitro human lymphocyte clastogen- 
esis and mouse fibroblast assays, and in the in vivo mouse mi- 
cronudeus test. In the in vitro assays, stavudine elevated the frequency 
of chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes (concentrations 
of 25 to 250 pg/ml, without metabolic activation) and increased 

the frequency ol tianstoimetl loci in mouse libiutilasl colir. licit 
centrations of 25 to 2500 un/hiL, with and without metabolic activation). 

1 The parallel track program (STUOY A1455-900) treated 12,551 HIV-in¬ 
fected patients with CD4 counts <300/mm* who nad tailed, were intoler¬ 
ant of. or had contraindications to other therapies. 


In the in vivo micronucleus assay, stavudine was clastogenic in bone 
marrow cells following oral stavudine administration to mice at 
dosages of 600 to 2000 mg/kg/day for 3 days. 

No evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats with exposures 
(based on C^) up to 216 times that observed following a clinical 
dosage of 1 mg/kg/day 
Pregnancy 

Pregnancy "Category C”. Reproduction studies have been performed 
in rats and rabbits with exposures (based on Cm*,) up to 399 and 
183 times, respectively, of that seen at a clinical dosage of 1 mg/kg/day 
and have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. The incidence in fe 
tuses of a common skeletal variation, unossified or incomplete ossi¬ 
fication of stemebra, was increased in rats al 399 times human exposure, 
while no effect was observed at 216 times human exposure. A slight 
post-implantation loss was noted at 216 times the human exposure 
with no effect noted at approximately 135 times the human expo¬ 
sure. An increase in early rat neonatal mortality (birth-to 4 days ol age) 
occurred at 399 times the human exposure, while survival ol neonates 
was unatledcd at approximately 135 times the human exposure A study 
in rats showed that stavudine is transferred to the fetus through tbe 
placenta The concentration in fetal tissue was approximately one-halt 
the concentration in maternal plasma There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction 
studies are not always predictive ot human response, stavudine 
should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed 
Nursing Mothers 

Studies in lactatmg rats demonstrated that stavudine is excreted in milk. 
Although it is not known whether stavudine is excreted in human 
milk, there exists the potential for adverse effects from stavudine in 
nursing infants. Mothers should be instructed to discontinue nursing 
if they are receiving stavudine. This is consistent with the recom¬ 
mendation by the U S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Con¬ 
trol and Prevention that HIV-infected mothers not breast-feed their in¬ 
fants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. 

Pediatric Use 

Use of stavudine in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from 
adequate and well-controlled studies of stavudine in adults with ad¬ 
ditional safety data in 115 pediatric patients and pharmacokinetic 
data in 25 of these patients. 

Stavudine pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in 25 HIV- 
infected pediatric patients (age range: 5 weeks to 15 years, weight 
range: 2 to 43 kg) after IV and oral administration of 0.125, 0.5, 
1, and 2 mg/kg as single doses and as BID regimens. The mean 
t SD absolute bioavailability was 76.9 1 31.7% (n=20). Peak plas¬ 
ma concentration (C«J and area under the plasma concentration¬ 
time curve (AUC) increased in proportion to dose after both sin¬ 
gle and multiple doses. 

Following intravenous infusions (n=21), the mean t SD volume 
of distribution was 18.5 ±9.17 L/m'. The distribution of stavudine into 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assessed in 8 pediatric patients after 
12 weeks of multiple oral dosing The concentration of stavudine in 
CSF samples ranged form 0.008 to 0 105 pg/ml at times tanging from 
2 to 3 hours post-dose (dose ranging from 0.125 to 1 mg/kg). CSF 
concentrations ranged from 16% to 125% (mean t SO ol 59% t 35%) 
of the concentration in simultaneous plasma samples. 

The terminal elimination half-line after oral or intravenous ad¬ 
ministration of stavudine was approximately one hour. The mean ± 
SD total body clearance after intravenous infusion was 247 ± 94 
mL/min/m'. The mean t SD apparent oral clearance was 333 ± 87 
mL/min/m'. The percent ol the dose excreted uncharged in the urine 
was 34.5% after oral administration. 

The clearance of stavudine is related to both body surface area and 
body weight. When dosing according to body weight, the recommended 
dosage for pediatric patients weighing less than 30 kg is 2 mg/kg/day 
in divided doses. Pediatric patients weighing 30 kg or greater should 
receive the recommended adult dose. 

ADVERSE REACTIONS 

The major clinical toxicity of ZERIT (stavudine) is peripheral neuropathy 
(see "WARNINGS" section) 

Adults: Peripheral neuropathy is dose related (see Table 2) 
Modest elevation of hepatic transaminases was also observed com-

crack about their lifestyle. Every¬ 
one — even an unseen audience 
— seems to be in on the gay joke. 

In the second episode, “Safety 
Tips,” Ace and Gary thoughtfully 
show three teenage boys how to 
cross the street (holding hands) 
and shower (holding hands), and 
how to plug in a lamp (Ace posi¬ 
tions himself behind Gary as if 
ready for butt-fucking). The teens 
stand in for puzzled straight au¬ 
diences, arguing over whether or 
not the duo are “fruits” and look¬ 
ing appalled when the two sashay 
arm in arm across the street. 

Best buddy 

More cartoon-based fun 
comes in Lewis Klahr’s masterful 
Pony Glass, about Superman’s 
best buddy, Jimmy Olsen. In 
paper cut-outs Klahr transforms 
the tormented redhead into an Ed 
Wood lookalike cocksucker, com¬ 
plete with various wigs, bras, and 
panties; puts him on both top 
and bottom in hardcore sex 
footage; and has him enact a se¬ 
ries of sexually charged psy¬ 
chodramas set in 1950s comic¬ 
book environments. Pony Glass is 
a perfect argument for reintro¬ 
ducing shorts to regular theatri¬ 
cal exhibition. 

Not all of the shorts in this 
program are based on cartoon 
characters. Many of them use an¬ 
other childhood standby, the doll, 
for their critique. Hazel Grian’s 
Baby-Cue corrals every imagin¬ 
able doll from the last few 
decades — Barbies, kewpies, 
Betsy-Wetsys — into a series of 
increasingly bizarre settings. 
Giant, blank-faced dolls with 
dirty faces lumber like mini- 
Godzillas through gaudy, eerie 
landscapes made of M&M hous¬ 
es, stampeding herds of “My Pret¬ 
ty Ponies,” and doll parts roasting 
on spits. More camp than queer, 
Baby-Cue is a disturbing look at 
the dark side of these allegedly in¬ 
nocent toys. 

In Corky Quackenbush’s 
Switch Your Ride, an assortment 
of violent or victimized Barbies 
and Kens do just that. While Ken 
defends their dream home against 
a drunken intruder-doll, Barbie 
runs off with her Harley-riding, 
shaved-head, leather-clad girl¬ 
friend. By the end of the film’s two 
minutes, Ken and his male friend 
have paired off, too. The same di¬ 
rector’s Sex Toy Story amusingly 
recounts the fight between an an¬ 
imated dildo, whip, blow-up doll, 
and leather mask, over which one 
is their mistress’s favorite. Both 
films showcase Quackenbush’s so¬ 
phisticated use of state-of-the-art 
Pixar-style animation. 

One of the most ambitious 
films in this program concerns 
yet another doll, this time the 
hapless title character in Todd 
Downing’s Dirty Baby Does Fire 
Island. It’s more like Fire Island 
Does Dirty Baby, as this pitiful 
dime-store doll with a perma¬ 
nently shocked expression and 
frantically fast movements en¬ 
counters one terrifying queer 
tableau after another, from mus¬ 
cular half-naked weightlifters to 
coke-snorting queens, to naked, 
sweating faggots fucking in bed. 
The comic-pathetic Dirty Baby 
occupies the same psychic space 
as Saturday Night Lives Mr. Bill; 
her horrified reactions and des¬ 
perate movements as she gets 
drenched in coke dust or stoned 
from a rolling bottle of poppers 
are just as wondrous to behold. ▼

'Queer Innovators' 

Personal visions 



by Gary Morris 


1 . n James Broughton’s Hermes 

Bird, a seven-minute close-up 
® of a penis in various stages of 
arousal, the filmmaker reads a line 
from one of his poems: “This is the 
secret that will not stay hidden 
The six-part Queer Innovators se¬ 
ries in this year’s Lesbian and Gay 
Film Festival, of which Hermes 
Bird is a part, is making sure the se-. 
cret — the queer contribution to 
experimental film for the last seven 
decades — doesn’t stay hidden. 

Broughton’s 1979 phallic 
paean stresses the primal power of 
sexuality, but such themes had to 
be cleverly masked in earlier 
works mining the same territory. 
Jean Cocteau’s Blood of a Poet pre¬ 
dates Broughton by 50 years, but 
is equally lyrical, if less single- 
minded, in its sensually surreal 
tableaux of beautiful, martyred, 
half-naked men. Freud’s com¬ 
ment that watching the film was 
“like looking through a keyhole at 
a man undressing” still applies to 
Cocteau’s very personal vision. 

The infamous Lot in Sodom, 
directed by James Sibley Watson 
and Melville Webber, mingles Bib¬ 
lical kitsch, mock-damnation im¬ 


ages, and again beautifully partial¬ 
ly clad men, including one seen 
naked from behind, in its then- 
shocking visualization of a well- 
known Bible story. The filmmak¬ 
ers’ use of multiple images of their 
male subjects, in a kind of radical 
“smearing” technique, is a telling 
example of the difficulty at the 
time of “fixing” the homosexual 
image. Without being completely 
overt, Kenneth Anger’s Fireworks 
(1947) moves into more trans¬ 
gressive territory with its images of 
fetishized sexuality and a sailor’s 
erection that erupts like a roman 
candle. Maya Deren’s forceful psy¬ 
chic landscapes in Meshes of the 
Afternoon (1943) were extremely 
influential in validating the trans¬ 
position of inner realities —- 
which would include gay and les¬ 
bian realities — to the screen. 

More recent queer filmmakers 
owe a debt to these predecessors 
for making it possible to un¬ 
abashedly integrate their sexuality 
into their work. Anie Stanley’s 
brief, scintillating Easy Garden 
(1994) offers its own brand of les¬ 
bian fireworks in compelling im¬ 
ages of cotton candy swirling on a 
stick, Busby Berkeley semi-nude 
women in formation, and daz¬ 
zling close-ups of female finger- 


fucking. Jennifer Reeder’s Clit-o- 
matic (1995) features “White 
Trash Girl” in an unapologetic 
anti-male, anti-maternal camp as¬ 
sault. Barbara Hammer has de¬ 
scribed her Dyketactics (1974) as 
“an erotic lesbian commercial... a 
coming-out film, celebrating what 
it was like to make love to a 
woman.” With its 110 lesbian im¬ 
ages in a mere four minutes, 
Dyketactics (1974) is also a fasci¬ 
nating artifact of the lesbian sep¬ 
aratist movement — historian 
Raymond Murray recalls that 
“Hammer attempted to restrict 
initial screenings of the film to 
women.” In Gently Down the 
Stream (1981), Su Friedrich in¬ 
vokes a series of lesbian dream- 
scapes and applies a written com¬ 
mentary across striking black- 
and-white imagery. 


Daily life as a kind of suffocat¬ 
ing dream is the subject of Chan- 
tal Akerman’s 3+ hour master¬ 
piece, Jeanne Dielman (1975), 
starring Delphine Seyrig. Aker- 
man, one of the great filmmakers 
working today, has proven prob¬ 
lematic to those who wish to pi¬ 
geonhole, if not assimilate her, be¬ 
cause she’s refused to be ghet¬ 
toized as a “lesbian director.” It’s 
surely good news that she’s al¬ 
lowed Jeanne Dielman to be 
shown in this year’s festival, hav¬ 
ing pulled other of her films from 
gay festivals in the past. The fact 
that this epic about the agoniz¬ 
ingly slow breakdown of a mid¬ 
dle-class woman is almost impos¬ 
sible to see theatrically and is not 
available on video makes it — like 
much of the Queer Innovators 
programs — essential viewing. ▼ 


HBO's 'Dragtime' 

The Girlene factor 


by Robert Julian 


or sheer goofiness and all- 
around good humor, it’s un¬ 
likely anything at the film 
festival will surpass Dragtime, a 
70-minute documentary directed 
by Patti Kaplan for HBO. Kaplan 
gathers the usual suspects (minus 
RuPaul) for what is billed as a se¬ 
rious look at burning questions 
like, “How do they do it? Why do 
they do it?” and “How do they get 
that cleavage?” Get outta heah. 
Dragtime is about high camp, high 
heels, high hair, and high drama 
— all played for laughs. A stroll 
down the raison d’etre path would 
send this film straight to hell. For¬ 
tunately, that doesn’t happen. 

Lady Bunny, Charles Busch, 
Lypsinka, Varla Jean Merman, 
Charlie Brown, and the now-re- 


tired Charles Pierce all strut their 
stuff on stages across the country 
from Atlanta to New York, 
Philadelphia to Los Angeles. And 
oh, my— they certainly have stuff 
to strut. Along the way, the perfor¬ 
mances are interspersed with in¬ 
terviews with the main subjects of 
the documentary. The occasional 
attempt to associate cross-dressing 
with the history of the world and 
the rise or fall of Western civiliza¬ 
tion gets appropriately crushed 
under the weight of simple, tren¬ 
chant observations like the one 
made by Jem Jensen, “It’s just 
about dressing up.” However, Lady 
Bunny, with tongue firmly plant¬ 
ed in cheek, pulls off a minor coup 
with the remark, “The founding 
fathers of our country wore wigs, 
so I do feel we’re carrying on a 
very rich American tradition.” 

There are lots of curious facts 


dropped along the sequined road 
to dragdom, none more amusing 
than Varla Jean Merman’s confes¬ 
sion that he grew up with a father 
who was an FBI agent and a 
mother who was a psychic, “I did¬ 
n’t get away with anything in high 
school!” He more than makes up 
for that with his big-busted fe¬ 
male chanteuse, Varla Jean Mer¬ 
man, the alleged illegitimate 
daughter of Ethel Merman and 
Ernest Borgnine. Varla Jean, who 
often appears in San Francisco at 
Josie’s Cabaret, is a delight. 

Filmmaker Patti Kaplan does a 
great job of finding the right mix 
between onstage and offstage per¬ 
sonas, big drag extravaganzas and 
little clubs. Kaplan works the dress¬ 
ing rooms, the footlights, New Or¬ 
leans’ Mardi Gras, the gay parades, 
and the streets of New York. She 
even follows the girls, all in high 



Patti Kaplan's Dragtime 


drag, on a shopping and luncheon 
date through Manhattan. Just 
watching these big-titted, big-haired 
apparitions emerging from taxicabs 
is worth the price of admission. 
Dragtime is a colorful romp through 
a former subculture that has be¬ 
come increasingly mainstream, and 
it’s destined to be one of The major 
crowd-pleasers of the festival. What 
to wear? You go, girl. T

n accurate reflection of so¬ 
cietal attitudes towards sex 
iril and drugs in the late ^Os- 
early ’70s won’t be found in the 
mainstream Hollywood films of 
that era. The comedies reduced 
the issues to who-put-pot-in-the- 
brownies? or Who’s-that-girl-in- 
my-bed?-type jokes, while most of 
the dramas now seem excessively 
whitewashed and polite. To get 
some sense of the prurience, fear 
and hysteria that surrounded the 
sexual revolution and the rise in 
drug use 30 years ago, you have to 
examine the fringe cinema of the 
period: pornos, educational films, 
and exploitation flicks. 

Yerba Buena Center For The 
Arts screens a stellar line-up of 
some of this fringe cinema in its 
current series, Trash Kings of Cult 
Cinema. Film archivist Jack 
Stevenson has put together two 
programs, Films From the Cellar: 
Sleazy S.F. Sex Pics and Psychedel¬ 
ic Cult Film Meltdown, both of 
which — in their switched-on 
and with-it moments — provide 
plenty of camp hilarity. But on a 
deeper level, in the way they alter¬ 
nate between raunchy and moral¬ 
istic, cautionary and sensational- 
istic, these films mirror the am¬ 
bivalent attitudes towards sex and 
drugs in Nixon-era America. 

Films From the Cellar: Sleazy 
S.F. Sex Pics includes works that 
have sometimes more than one 




Get That Sailor! from Sleazy S.F. Sex Pics at Yerba Buena 


connection to the Bay Area. Many 
of the films were screened locally 
as part of Stevenson’s cheese ’n’ 
sleaze cinematic showcases in the 
early ’90s. Other offerings were 
shot in San Francisco, such as the 
intermittently uproarious My Fa¬ 
ther’s Call Girl. This 1968 softcore 
porno follows a glamorously 
skanky young couple as they get 
carried away while perusing girly 
mags in a Mission St. smut shack. 
Before long the pair is writhing 
together, holding photos of stiff 
cocks and wet pussies at their 
crotches, while squealing Judy 
Carne-isms like “Sock it to me, 
baby!” and “I dig it!” It’s all very 
early John Waters, right down to 
the actress’s ratty bouffant and the 
actor’s frightful skin condition. 

Sleazy S.F. Sex Pics also in¬ 
cludes a number of porn trailers, 
both straight and gay. We’re treat¬ 
ed to teasers of Sex and the Work¬ 
ing Girl, a kooky, early ’70s XXX 
film starring a glossy-lipped Kay 
Lenz lookalike, as well as China 
Girl, a sex-action-drama hybrid 
full of karate chops, car chases 
and blow jobs. The gay porn trail¬ 
ers include the tantalizing Get 
That Sailor, which consists of a 
gaggle of cute boys fucking to a 
go-go beat, and Blue Summer 
Breeze, a scenic skin flick about a 
young ex-G.I. who “discovers a 
male paradise” in the wilds of 
Northern California. Except for 
the occasional couple rimming on 
a boulder, this lushly pho¬ 
tographed, travelogue-like film 
could be a commercial by Califor¬ 
nia’s Bureau of Tourism. 

Any sweet taste left in your 
mouth from those jism-intensive 
opuses will be washed away with 
the trailer to another gay porno, 
Devil in the Flesh. This preview 
features comically stilted narra¬ 
tion (“This is Lenny. Lenny lives 
in a world of sensuality and petty 
crime”) over a montage of clips 
from a grim little film about a gay 
man who picks up a sexy 
trick/psycho killer. On the basis of 
this trailer, Devil in the Flesh pre¬ 
sents an ugly, sordid view of gay 
life and likely sent its audience 
home in a severe state of self- 
loathing. If we know San Francis¬ 
co queens, this one’s going to be 
received with a chorus of hisses. 

Even more likely to offend is 
Animal Lovers, an early 70s docu¬ 
mentary on bestiality from Den¬ 
mark. The film begins with a 
pseudo-academic tone as a mid¬ 
dle-aged man dryly lectures on 
the topic of bestiality through the 
ages. This segment turns bizarre 
when, in the middle of his speech, 
we begin to hear the faint cries of 
a cat, which gradually grow loud¬ 


er and more pained. Is this just 
some sick joke? It’s not likely, con¬ 
sidering the dead-serious tone of 
the rest of the film. The most un¬ 
settling segment has this same 
bestiality expert interviewing a 
seemingly distraught San Jose 
woman who claims to have been 
forced to fellate dogs when she 
was kidnapped in Marrakech. 
Jovial in comparison is a later in¬ 
terview with a “little farm girl” in 
Denmark, who proudly admits to 
having had sex with a bull, a pig, a 
horse and — the best in the sack 
by far, she says — her dog, Lassie. 
The “girl” (actually a buxom, 
cornfed Dane of about 30) then 
offers to engage in a quickie with 
Lassie for the cameras, an act 
which is thankfully edited out. 

Fever dream 

While Sleazy S.F. Sex Pics bold¬ 
ly covers predilections of almost 
every stripe, Stevenson’s other 
program, Psychedelic Cult Film 
Meltdown, is even more diverse, 
stringing its seemingly-unrelated 
segments together with the logic 
of a fever dream. In this collection, 
scenes from a drugs-in-the-’burbs 
melodrama, The People Next Door, 
segue into a surreal short from 
Norway on tooth decay. The latter 
film features crude, scary-looking 
puppets shrieking dialogue and 
songs (no subtitles provided) 
while romping around a set of 
giant molars. Like Teletubbies, this 
is children’s entertainment filled 
with sights and sounds highly 
conducive to tripping. 

Speaking of tripping, actress 
Deborah Winters spends little 
screentime not on acid, speed, 
coke, weed or heroin (as she says 
at one point, “I’ve done all the 
grooves”) in the 20 or so sidesplit¬ 
ting minutes we see of The People 
Next Door. This was one of many 
theatrical and made-for-TV 
movies in the early ’70s that dealt 
with the scourge of white kids on 
dope. Some of these films, such as 
Go Ask Alice and Maybe I’ll Come 
Home in the Spring (the latter fea¬ 
turing a post- Gidget Sally Field as 
a hippie stoner!), were relatively 
thoughtful and effective. The Peo¬ 
ple Next Door, on the other hand, 
is a screechy, overwrought drama 
about a 16-year-old junkie (Win¬ 
ters), and the devastating effects 
her addiction has on her model 
mom and dad (a slumming Julie 
Harris and Eli Wallach). In this 
exploitation flick, it isn’t enough

ment value, and of course camp 
content. Using these criteria, there 
is much to cheer here, and no 
more to vilify than should be ex¬ 
pected. 

At the top of the must-see list 
are three imports, one of which 
has historical significance beyond 
its considerable cinematic inter¬ 
est. Dakan (1997) is the first West 
African gay feature, and an¬ 
nounces itself as such from the 
first scene, a steamy make-out ses¬ 
sion in a car between two teenage 
boys. Director Mohamed Cama¬ 
ra, filming in secret due to the 
touchy subject matter, convinc¬ 
ingly overlays a class conflict and 
social critique onto this gay 
Romeo and Juliet update, but the 
focus is always on the emotional 
power of a taboo relationship. 
Zhang Yuan’s Chinese/French co¬ 
production East Palace, West 
Palace (1996) details an equally 
“impossible” relationship, this 
time between a hunky, sadistic 
straight policeman and the 
masochistic queen he arrests and 
tortures for cruising a park. As in 
Dakan, the attraction here is the 
unassailable truth of emotions 
and the desperate need to live au¬ 
thentically. The subdued, beauti¬ 
fully shot Steam (1997), directed 
by Ferzan Ozpetek, is a bittersweet 
picture of a married Italian archi¬ 
tect who finds emotional libera¬ 
tion in a gay romance during a 
business trip to Turkey. 

Lesbian junkie 

Another high point of the fes¬ 
tival, High Art (1998), has a pedi¬ 
gree that might put off viewers 
who think well-known stars like 
Ally Sheedy aren’t compatible 
with “independent film.” But di¬ 
rector Lisa Cholodenko’s quietly 
dire vision of a burned-out les¬ 
bian junkie artist and her pals in 
New York should not be missed. 
More classically “independent” is 
Gary Rosen and Greg Pritikin’s 
ragged, wonderfully funny slack¬ 
er comedy Totally Confused 
(1998). Rosen charms as a Woody 
Allen-like gay schlemiel who t like 
his straight best friend (played by 
Pritikin), spends most of his time 
in a fog of comic self-delusion. If 
no one has suggested to this tal¬ 
ented pair that they sell this as a 
TV show, let me do so here. 

Another comedy, Marta Ballet- 
bo-Coll and Simeon Curgeo’s 
Honey I Sent the Men to the Moon 


she says simply, “I don’t think I 
know any artists in the closet.” A 
lesbian love affair between a Nazi 
sympathizer and a Jewish under¬ 
ground worker would seem too 
improbable to be real, but Catrine 
Clay’s Love Story (1997) beautiful¬ 
ly delineates this obsessive ro¬ 
mance that only ended when one 
of them was shipped to the death 
camps. 

Another German, the ever¬ 
present Rosa von Praunheim, 
substantially documents the his¬ 
tory of homosexuality (primarily 
male) in his country in Gay 
Courage (1997), and winds up in 
the “gay mecca” of San Francisco 
to tell us how liberated we are. 
The historical reenactments are 
embarrassing, but solid analysis 
and interviews provide balance. 
Jeff Dupre’s Out of the Past (1997) 
is a welcome portrait of noted les¬ 
bian high school student Kelli Pe¬ 
terson, whose poise and grace in 
the face of Mormon fanatics is an 
object lesson in fighting oppres¬ 
sion. The film gives historical per¬ 
spective by positioning Peterson 
as part of a long tradition of queer 
activists. Mark Rappaport is a 
well-known pop culture excavator 
(Jean Seberg, Rock Hudson); his 
new film, The Silver Screen: Color 
Me Lavender (1998), is a wry look 
at the apparently vast queer sub¬ 
text in Hollywood comedies, 
westerns, and Film noirs. Revi¬ 
sionism, even when fueled by a 
camp sensibility, can be problem¬ 
atic as an historical method, but 
Rappaport is convincing, if over- 
long, on his subject. 

Jesse Helms is perhaps the last 
person any self-respecting queer 
would want to claim or reclaim, 
but director Tim Kirkman in Dear 
Jesse (1997) finds unsuspected

York is also the setting for a resur¬ 
rected classic, Paul Morrisey’s 
Trash, which showcases Joe Dalle- 
sandro’s definitive bored junkie 
hunk. Less alluring but more 
compelling, perhaps, is Holly 
Woodlawn’s corrosive, wigged- 
out drag queen, whose goals in life 
are to get on welfare and get Joe 
back on top of her (a wish much 
of the audience will appreciate). 

Hammer probes 

One of the attractions of the 
SFILGFF is the unveiling of hid¬ 
den histories and the airing-out of 
closets of the past. Barbara Ham¬ 
mer’s The Female Closet (1998) is 
an outstanding example, probing 
without polemicizing the lives of 
three women artists and their re¬ 
lationship to the closet. Painter 
Nicole Eisenman offers refreshing 
evidence of social change when 


A scene from Love Story. 


(1997), is a too-tame satire of gen¬ 
der wars and consumer culture. 
This labored effort is a major dis¬ 
appointment from the talented 
director of 1995’s Costa Brava. 
Perhaps the lack of the kind of les¬ 
bian element present in the earli¬ 
er film capsized this one. Better is 
Waris Hussein’s intermittently 
droll Sixth Happiness (1997) 
about a “boy” (he looks about 50) 
.with a bone disease who stops 
growing at four feet but manages 
to seduce several beautiful people, 
male and female. Moving down a 
few notches is Bernard Salzman’s 
maudlin “AIDS movie” The Un¬ 
known Cyclist (1998). This film 
has the suffocatingly fake am¬ 
biance of a Lifetime cable TV 
movie, which also accounts for its 
target audience. Stephen Spinella 
regurgitates his trademark 
screaming, self-righteous queen 
routine, Lea Thompson evapo¬ 
rates before your eyes as the legal 
wife of Spinella’s dead “ex-hus- 
band,” and poor, beautiful Danny 
Nucci tries vainly to conjure a 
character out of the script’s mi¬ 
croscopic pickings. 

AIDS appears to be less press¬ 
ing in this year’s lineup than in 
the past, perhaps for pharmaco¬ 
logical reasons. Together Alone, P.J. 
Castellaneta’s two-person, single¬ 
set, almost-real-time talkathon 
about safe sex and other topics, 
actually dates to 1991. Ioannis 
Mookas’ documentary Only 
Human (1998) takes the opposite 
tack of most AIDS movies, exam¬ 
ining in moving detail the pecu¬ 


liar problem of men surrounded 
by an epidemic who have man¬ 
aged to avoid it. Shorts about 
AIDS like Christos Dimas’ Breath 
carry their own caveat in the cat¬ 
alog description: “ Breath says 
goodbye through four elegiac 
dance pieces.” 

Trouble with trade is the sub¬ 
ject of Paul Oremland’s 1998 Like 
It Is. The trade in question is 
Craig (Steve Bell), a violent, sexy 
brat whose ample charms bring 
grief to his music producer lover. 
Watch for Roger Daltrey as a 
clever, manipulative old queen. 
Jimmy Smallhorne’s mood- 
drenched 2by4 is another drama 
about our friends from the British 
Isles — well, butch Irish expats in 
New York — struggling with the 
lure of drugs and queer sex. New

Walk-on pricks 

Some of this year’s prick ap¬ 
pearances are barely walk-ons, 
much less hard-ons. In Waris 
Hussein’s Sixth Happiness, a 
queen dwarf and his sister titter 
when they glimpse a naked man 
in a magazine. Jimmy Small- 
horne’s 2by4, a drama about the 
working-class Irish, has a few dick 
scenes, but they’re mostly swad¬ 
dled in shadows. Fenton Bailey 
and Randy Barbato’s Party Mon- 


another AIDS-inflected story that 
fails in the dick department, in 
spite of the dramatic desirability 
of full-frontal nudity in a movie 
where much of the characters’ 
midnight chatter is about sex. Fer- 
zan Ozpetek’s Turkish/Italian pro¬ 
duction Steam is another one 
filled with fetching men who re¬ 
grettably never take it off. Culture 
mavens will be righdy thrilled that 
Dakan, a superb gay West African 
feature (from Guinea) even got 
released, but the fanatic phal- 
lophile may not forgive the lack of 
dick shots of the film’s two beau¬ 
tiful leading men. 

The most scintillating of this 
year’s cock tableaux belong not to 
this year but to the 1970s. The 

Genital highlights include Tony 
Ward masturbating in the bathtub, 
and porn prince Matt Bradshaw 
using his massive manmeat. 


ster, about the navel-gazing 
queen-murderer Michael Alig of 
Club Kids fame, has some brief 
cock images, but the context is so 
repellent that only the most 
diehard dickwatchers will want to 
add this one to their list. 

Still, these are better than those 
films that practically scream for 
schlong but don’t have any. 
Bernard Salzman’s The Unknown 
Cyclist has the gorgeous Danny 
Nucci mostly in bicycle leotards, 
but this wretched “AIDS movie” 
refuses to make good on this 
promise and show us Danny’s no¬ 
doubt mesmerizing goods. His 
tantalizing suggestion of a dick¬ 
measuring contest, which fails to 
materialize, is bitter icing on an 
inedible cake. Together Alone is 


purest example is James 
Broughton’s Hermes Bird (1979), 
a seven-minute single shot of a 
penis first in repose, then brought 
to reassuring stiffness. “Firearm of 
my spirit,” says Broughton in a 
poetic overdub, “all that flows into 
flame.” Yes, James, exactly. Paul 
Morrisey’s Trash (1970) is re¬ 
markable for a lot of things, not 
least of which is an ongoing dis¬ 
play of Joe Dallesandro’s conse¬ 
crated cock in a happy variety of 
situations. Ironically, this icon- 
stud plays an impotent junkie, but 
Warhol superstar Jane Forth, see¬ 
ing the objet d’sacre for the first 
time, says it all in a mantra that 
devoted dicksters will repeat like a 
Buddhist chant: “Oh, my... you’re 
rather large.” ▼ 


. . or those of our readers who 
prefer anatomy to artistry, or 
more coarsely, meat to 
melodrama, we offer the follow¬ 
ing consumer guide. There’s no 
need to wade through the acres of 
cinema that comprise the Lesbian 
and Gay Film Festival if all you re¬ 
ally want to know — as so many 
of us do — is which films show, in 
a fleeting glimpse, half-light, or 
extended mesmerizing sequence, 
our spongy-tissued little pal. This 
survey is by no means complete, 
and we encourage readers who 
encounter full-frontal male nudi¬ 
ty in films not mentioned here to 
spread the word among their fel¬ 
low penisspotters. 

There appear to be fewer trea¬ 
sures in this realm than last year, 
but the diligent dickophile can 
find ample reason to patronize the 
largest lesbian and gay film festi¬ 
val in the world. Some of the 
sightings this year were in expect¬ 
ed places. The shorts program 
Porn Dogs is a virtual phallic feast. 
Nguyen Tan’s These Are My Fa¬ 
vorite Things finds us in agree¬ 
ment with the title as a BFD (big 
fat dick) has its way with an en¬ 
thusiastic partner. Steve Reinke’s 
Andy contrasts the pleasures of 
the penis with the terrors of home 
decorating, courtesy of “Andy’”s 
insistence on talking about wall 
sconces and crown molding while 
kneading his substantial schlong. 
Most outrageous is Pansexual 
Public Porn, by the well-named 
Del LaGrace Volcano. Volcanic in¬ 
deed are real-life scenes of public 
mouth-fucking, fisting, pissing, 
and lurid FTM sexual hijinx. 

Leave it to the Germans to 
elaborate on the primacy of the 
prick. Rosa von Praunheim res¬ 
cues the stranded cockwatcher 
with Gay Courage, an otherwise 
overlong documentary with 
painfully bad historical recre¬ 
ations. A parade of penises make 
this necessary if not always re¬ 
warding viewing. Rosa’s spiritual 
brother, Jochen Hick, interviewed 
nine men involved with porn, 
modeling, hustling, etc. in Sex Life 
in L.A. Hardcore highlights in¬ 
clude Madonna’s ex-boyfriend 
Tony Ward masturbating in the 
bathtub, and porn prince Matt 
Bradshaw using his massive man- 
meat on various hapless accom¬ 
plices. Fans of the literal cutting- 
edge may appreciate performance

links between the wizened pusher 
of legal drugs and himself: “We 
both have an obsession with ho¬ 
mosexual men!” This documen¬ 
tary also finds spirited resistance, 
particularly among women, 
against His Odiousness in the 
New South, but ultimately Kirk- 
man is preaching to the choir. Per¬ 
haps Jesse should be asked to look 
at Jochen Hick’s aptly titled docu¬ 
mentary Sex/Life in L.A. (1998). 

* Hick’s endless parade of fucking 
and cocksucking hustlers, models, 
porn stars, etc., might inspire 
Helms to find a new career as a 
grim-faced daddy, slobbering, 
toothless old bottom, or ancient, 
distinguished leather queen, since 
his time “serving” the nation is 
running out. 

Some of the festival’s treasures 
are squirreled away in dense 
shorts programs. The Queer Car¬ 
toons II show (see review in this 
issue) mines the heights and 
depths of camp, but there are oth¬ 
ers worth pointing out. In the Yel¬ 
low Fever program, Wayne Yung’s 
The Queens Cantonese brilliantly 
skewers language programs by in¬ 
troducing queer sexual elements: 
“Fuck me, please ... Deeper, 
please...” Ian Iqbal Rashid’s Sur¬ 
viving Sabu, piggybacked onto the 
aforementioned Sixth Happiness, 
uses the fetching 1940s boy star as 
a vehicle for a dazzling look into 
the gap between an uptight Indian 
father and his inexplicably gay 
son. Two entries in the Fun in 
Boys’ Shorts program are worth 
the show. Harry Victor’s slick Ly- 


Dear Jesse 


canthrophobia, about a peculiar 
revenge exacted on two gaybash- 
ers, has a genuinely creepy atmos¬ 
phere, and Dean Slotar’s The Ab¬ 
solution of Anthony masterfully 
sketches a hunky Puerto Rican 
teenager obsessed with phone sex. 

Among the least categorizable 
films this year is Hilary Brougher’s 
provocative The Sticky Fingers of 
Time. Part sci-fi drama (with lib¬ 
eral dashes of The Twilight Zone), 
part noir thriller, part lesbian/bi¬ 
sexual search story, this ambitious 
work is alternately confusing and 
compelling, but ultimately moves 
in too many directions to be en¬ 
tirely effective. Another elusive 
film is Sergio Toledo’s 1986 mas¬ 
terpiece, Vera. The mystery-gen¬ 
dered title character’s obsession 
with living according to an inner 
reality and refusal to conform to 
others’ expectations no matter 
what the cost points the way to a 
thrilling future of gender chaos — 
and makes her a dandy poster girl 
for this year’s SFILGFF. T

Grimes does an unintentional 
parody of a Holocaust survivor 
with a generic Eastern European 
accent. 

Clarkson is atmospherically 
eerie as an ex-Fassbinder groupie 
who may or may not have ever 
been in a film, but is now lost in 
opium-fueled dreams of past and 
future glory. Lanky and luscious, 
with a Dietrich-inspired delivery, 
she may have really been some¬ 
thing, once. Her current talents 
include slurred speech, passing 
out, and accusing others of her 
own shortcomings. In one of her 
lower moments, she conscien¬ 
tiously picks up a spilled blob of 
scrambled eggs and flings it back 
on the plate before pulling the 
blankets up over both herself and 
breakfast. Greta has the kind of 
sick psychosexual hold on Lucy 
that our mothers warned us 
against when they brought us up 
not to be lesbians. 

There is a positive role model, 
but strictly speaking, she’s not a 
dyke. The film’s heroine, Syd 
(Radha Mitchell) is a baby-faced 
blonde who has a boyfriend, the 
apartment directly downstairs 
from Lucy, and a steady job. The 
film’s weakest moments are when 
we’re stuck at home with Syd and 
James (Gabriel Mann). It’s not 
their fault they’re young, blonde, 
and shallow, but it’s hard to stay 
interested. 

Surface qualities 

Syd does better in the offices of 
Frame, the slick New York photo 
mag where she’s just been pro¬ 
moted to assistant editor. Here 
she’s bookshelved by two icons of 
facade: Harry (David Thornton), 
the goateed editor for whom she 
fetches scones; and Dominique 
Peugeot (Anh Duong), the boss. 
We don’t get to see beneath the 
surface of these superficial people, 
but Duong’s surface has ripples. 
Maybe because she’s gigantic, 
deadpan, and has a face right out 
of Picasso’s Demoiselles d’Avignon. 
There’s a chilling scene at the 
bathroom mirror where she 
makes some demands, boss-to- 
underling, in a world-weary mo¬ 
notone, while making eye contact 
only with Syd’s reflection. 

Deploying pubescent bisex ap¬ 
peal, earnest ambition, and plain 
dumb luck, Syd orchestrates a 
photo spread of Berliner’s work 
that lands them in bed together, 
puts herself on the cover, and in¬ 
directly inspires the reluctant 
comeback to OD in Greta’s sepul- 


& 
ouse

chral arms. While nothing can re¬ 
ally be blamed on Syd, who is only 
the unwitting catalyst of some¬ 
body else’s self-destruction, it’s a 
pity Mitchell doesn’t even attempt 
to convey the moral ambivalence 
of blonde ambition. 

So much for plot and perfor¬ 
mance. What sets this film apart 
and makes it more than worthy of 
opening a festival (queer, co-de¬ 
pendent, or otherwise) is its 
“high” style. Form is content: shots 
are almost never centered; the 
screen is often divided in two, with 
a medium shot of a character ex¬ 
actly filling one half of the screen. 
The cinematography thus mimics 
the quirky compositions of the fic¬ 
tional photographer, seeming to 
catch the off-center characters off¬ 
guard. (And for once the work of 
an artist in a film lives up to its fic¬ 
tional reputation: JoJo Whilden’s 
photos are fab snaps.) 

Similar stylization is at work in 
the pacing and delivery. (Only 
Grimes, perhaps because of her 
unsinkable theatricality, can’t 
quite manage to syncopate.) 
There’s a lazy, off-the-cuff feel 
that is reassuring in its disciplined 
consistency. This very cool aes¬ 
thetic is better at showing the sur¬ 
face than suggesting the depths, 
and the film does suffer from its 
two-dimensional brilliance, but 
Baby, what a relief this is from po- 
litically-correct knee-jerk natural¬ 
ism. 

The loveliest thing about High 
Art is the length of its takes. Real 
confidence in the material and 
trust in the performers, not to 
mention the bucking of Holly¬ 
wood trends, is required for a di¬ 
rector to stay with the rhythm of a 
scene as lived. When Syd and Lucy 
get into bed together for the first 
time in some upstate New York 


B&B, they go from fully clothed to 
under the covers and emotionally 
naked in only six (count ’em, six) 
shots. 

Speaking of sex, this film has 
the most convincing (because 
least glamorized) intimate erotic 
encounters ever seen in a “les¬ 
bian” film. In fact, the whole film 
is erotic and intimate. Maybe it’s 
all that dreamy druginess steam¬ 
ing up Lucy and Greta’s apart¬ 
ment, but there’s an ambient sen¬ 
suality that means the characters 
don’t suddenly turn into sex ob¬ 
jects when they lie down together. 
The continuum between con¬ 
scious life and subconscious dri¬ 
ves established, characters retain 
their status as subjects and go to 
bed, feelings first. 

Despite or in keeping with its 
overly clever title, High Art intro¬ 
duces the viewer/voyeur to the 
heights of dependency common 
to drugs and impossible love, 
while sketching the paradox of 
egocentrism and ego-loss neces¬ 
sary to the making of either love 
or art. However ugly its subject 
sometimes gets, this viewer- 
friendly film is consistently easy 
on the eyes. T

Jean-Paul Fouchecourt plays the deluded denizen of the swamp Platee. 


antic postmodern spin of his 
own. With excellent singers, in¬ 
cluding the French haute-contre 
(very high tenor) Jean-Paul 
Fouchecourt in the title role, and 
21 members of the Mark Morris 
Dance Group playing everything 
from bar habitues to swamp 
denizens, Platee tells the story of a 
vain nymph who believes Jupiter 
is paying court to her, until her 
pretensions are exposed and 
everybody has a good, cruel laugh 
at her expense. 

Bar flies 

Morris and his set designer, 
Adrianne Lobel, imagine the 
mythological prologue, in which 
the gods of comedy, wine, and 
love get together at a bacchanal to 


cause the moral of this cruel tale 
is that ugly, vain, importunate 
women deserve to be humiliated. 
(Nobody ever said 18th-century 
Frenchmen were kind and gen¬ 
tle.) Jupiter and his warring 
spouse Juno wear red velvet (“Im¬ 
perial Margarine,” McGegan 
says), while Mercury sports a blue 
blazer and arrives from the flies in 
a gold machine complete with 
seat belt. 

Even funnier are Platee’s 
swamp critters: a lizard-in-wait¬ 
ing, a pair of amorous snakes who 
stick out their tongues at each 
other, madly dancing birds with 
beaks and feathered wings, a pair 
of babies in diapers, and philoso¬

place in a New York tavern, com¬ 
plete with Miller Beer signs and a 
glass terrarium behind the bar 
that turns into the set for Platee’s 
swamp. The bar’s customers in¬ 
clude a leather queen, a sailor, a 
policeman, a chorine, and a 
smashing dyke in pinstripes and 
Fedora who arm-wrestles the 
sailor. They dance while Marika 
Kuzma’s UC Berkeley Chamber 
Chorus sings from the pit. 

The swamp acts introduce 
Platee (Fouchecourt) in Margaret 
Dumont drag designed by Isaac 
Mizrahi. Not only does “she” have 
the most pendulous tits but she 
covers them in a bilious pink tea 
gown, complete with lorgnette 
and pearls. Fouchecourt main¬ 
tains Platee’s precarious dignity in 
this get-up, very necessary be- 


tion). Three Graces, one of them a 
prat-falling guy, are chased and 
groped by four hoofed Yokels in 
jockstraps and body stockings 
covered with unattractive clumps 
of hair. 

This silliness climaxes in Act 
Three with a pair of copulating 
turtles leading a madly careening 
chaconne that seems to introduce 
every dancer, musician, and singer 
in the Western world in one long 
conga line. It’s as if Rameau said, 
“I dare ya!” to Morris, and Morris 
said, “In yer face, Jean-Philippe!” 
By that time, the Zellerbach audi¬ 
ence was laughing, cheering, 
shrieking, screaming, hooting, 
yelling, whooping — and for all I 
know, they still are. What I want 
to know is how Morris makes it 
look so easy, when it so clearly 
isn’t. T 


by Stephanie von Buchau 


$ henever I start to think in 
advance of a new Mark 
Morris piece: “Been 
there, done that, got the T-shirt, 
yada, yada, yada,” the little dickens 
surprises me. We all know by now 
that Morris’ directing and chore¬ 
ographing is funny, raunchy, sexy, 
musical, touching, enchanting. 
His production of Jean-Philippe 
Rameau’s 1745 opera-ballet, 
Platee, which had its only Ameri¬ 
can performances at UC Berkeley 
last weekend, is all of that. It is 
also monumentally silly in all the 
best meanings of that word. 

Rameau, the Sondheim of the 
French Baroque, was probably too 
clever for his countrymen. Eng¬ 
lish-speaking critics have been 
suspicious of this contemporary 
of Bach and Handel because he 
didn’t write much religious 
music. Most of his theatrical 
works were composed for a frivo¬ 
lous, pleasure-seeking Parisian 
audience. They range from high- 
minded tragedies such as Hip- 
polyte et Aricie to low-down 
satires of the very operatic genre 
he had helped invent. 

Platee is just such a satire, a 
musical work sui generis that takes 
on mythology, royal romance (it 
was written for the wedding fes¬ 
tivities of the Dauphin and a 
Spanish Infanta who reportedly 
could stop a clock), and most im¬ 
portant of all, the stylized conven¬ 
tions of French Baroque theater. 
It is, literally, a laugh-riot, front- 
loaded with one musical joke after 
another. Most of these were clear¬ 
ly audible due to conductor 
Nicholas McGegan and his Phil- 
harmonia Baroque Orchestra, 
which has seldom sounded so 
sharp and pointed. 

Still, this is a Morris-Rameau 
show in which the director never 
betrays the composer’s express 
wishes, yet constantly illuminates 
the musical jokes while adding an

'L'lncoronazione di Poppea' 

Crowning achievement 


by Paul Thomason 

f you love opera, or even just 
kinda like it, do not miss the 
San Francisco Opera’s new 
production of Monteverdi’s L'ln¬ 
coronazione di Poppea. The open¬ 
ing performance last Saturday was 
one of the strongest I have seen 
from the company in my six years 
in San Francisco. The huge cast, 
almost two dozen soloists, had 
hardly a clinker among them. 

With the exception of Christo¬ 
pher Alden’s propensity for hav¬ 
ing singers lie on the floor at the 
slightest whim, the direction was 
deft, and given the directorial ex¬ 
cesses one often gets at the War 
Memorial, it seems churlish to 
complain about something that 
merely became monotonous. De¬ 
signer Robert Perdziola managed 
to mix an astonishing variety of 
styles into a pleasing whole. 

Monteverdi’s 17th-century 
retelling of the story of Nero’s 
tossing aside his wife Ottavia for 
his mistress Poppea takes about 


three and a half hours to unfold, 
and there is only one intermis¬ 
sion. But with Patrick Summers 
conducting his own version of the 
opera, the drama never sagged, 
the rich orchestral timbers were a 
constant delight (when was the 
last time you heard three sackbuts 
at the opera?), and the emotional 
tone of the evening was always ex¬ 
actly right. Magically, Summers 
and his forces made this intimate 
opera fill the War Memorial 
Opera House without violating 
the work. Bravi tutti. 

Despite the incredibly high 
level of singing and acting 
throughout the evening, there 
were a few performances which 
sparkled even more — chief 
among these, Lorraine Hunt in 
her company debut as Ottavia, 
and Robert Lloyd as Seneca. 
Halfway through Hunt’s first aria 
I wondered, “Could Maria Callas 
in her prime have been any more 
riveting on stage?” There was 
nothing Hunt could not do, vo¬ 
cally or dramatically. Her artistry 
had a completeness about it 



which one almost never gets 
today, and any well-run opera 
company would move Heaven 
and Earth to have her back every 
year. Her great Act III lament, “A 
Dio, Roma,” is something I shall 
never forget. 

Lloyd’s Seneca was not a 
musty, woolly-sounding philoso¬ 
pher, but a rich-toned, vibrant 
man who clearly sees what is 
going on. His confrontation with 
Nero was riveting. Lloyd seems to 
get better every time he is on 
stage, and one can only be thank¬ 
ful he is at the San Francisco 
Opera so regularly. We should 
never take him for granted. 

Hot Poppea 

Gorgeous Ruxandra Donose 
was an extremely hot Poppea, 
both vocally and dramatically, 
and debuting David Daniels’ Nero 
was a superb match. In his first 
scene, Daniels had a bit of trouble 
at the very top of his voice, but he 
went on to unleash some formi¬ 
dable coloratura and to do some 
of the most ravishing soft singing 
I have heard in ages — as well as 
creating a bratty, believable, al¬ 
most likable Nero. 

Despite the length of the 
evening, Mel Ulrich’s Ottone was 
so fabulous in every way one 
lamented the cuts in his part. 
Zvetelina Vassileva offered a pas¬ 
sionate, well-sung Drusilla. In his 
San Francisco Opera debut, tenor 
Barry Banks donned female attire 
and played Arnalta, Poppea’s 



Ruxandra Donose (Poppea) and David Daniels (Nerane) in Poppea 


nurse and confidante. He did it 
very well, often being funny with¬ 
out being too campy, until his last 
aria, when he (appropriately) 
went for broke. 

Among the other superbly rich 
performances that must be sin¬ 
gled out were Christina Lamber- 
ti’s Fortuna, Matthew Lord’s Lu- 
cano, John Relyea’s Mercurio, 
Norman Shankle in his company 


debut as Valletto, and Peggy Kriha 
Dye as Damigella. They each de¬ 
serve much more than a mere 
mention — as well as our grati¬ 
tude. ▼

Much of Psychedelic Cult Film 
Meltdown is made up of anti-drug 
spots, such as Hooks, a U.S. Army 
film narrated by that paragon of. 
clean country livin’, Michael “Papa 
Ingalls” Landon. The U.S. Navy 
produced the far more scintillat¬ 
ing Trip to Where?, an anti-drug 
film rife with homoerotism, in 
which an older male mentor 
guides a group of hunky young 
sailors as they all drop acid and 
get a glimpse into the “sunbursts 
of their souls.” Naturally, one of 
the sailors, a furry-chested cutie 
named Bill, has a bad trip and be¬ 
gins seeing horrifying images, 
such as one of himself in lipstick 
and a cheap blonde wig. It’s hard 
to tell if this film is a warning 
about the dangers of drugs or re¬ 
pressed sexuality. There’s no ques¬ 
tion as to what LSD Case Study, a 
5-minute film the Lockheed Cor¬ 
poration made for its employees, 
is warning us about. When you’re 
at your next swinging party, pass 
up the platters of blotter acid and 
stick with the bowls of Bugles and 
Screaming Yellow Zonkers in¬ 
stead, or you might just end up 
like the young woman in this film, 
whose hot dog turns into a troll 
doll right before her eyes. 

At first, it’s difficult to figure out 
what an episode of the mid-’70s 
religious TV show Insight is doing 
in the midst of all this drug hyste¬ 
ria, but somehow it fits perfectly. 
Thirty-minute mini-dramas deal¬ 


ing with provocative issues of the 
day, Insight was supposed to be ev¬ 
idence of a more progressive, less 
“uptight” Catholic Church. In re¬ 
ality, the show was heavy-handed 
and often creepy. The hippie-dippy 
episode included here, “Christmas 
2025,” is about a hip freethinker 
(we know he’s a hip freethinker by 
the lovebeads he wears) named 
George, who brings peace and love 
to a dehumanized future society. 
As played by a young and obvious¬ 
ly desperate James Cromwell (L.A. 
Confidential), George is part 
Christ-figure, part Rod McKuen, 
inspiring his flock with groovy 
gospel like, “Take your energy and 
turn it into a smile!” 

You may find that many images 
from Trash Kings of Cult Cinema 

— the eczema-covered stud in My 
Father's Call Girl, the possessed- 
looking puppets in Karius OgBak- 
tus or, particularly, the hot dog- 
turned-troll doll in LSD Case Study 

— will come back to haunt you 
like acid flashbacks. Not all the 
films here present such hallucina¬ 
tory delights, but this series still 
qualifies as essential viewing for all 
cineastes with a taste for trash. ▼

Out There 

M page 34 


Richard, who used to live in the 
penthouse, but ever since the 
Northridge quake has taken quar¬ 
ters on the ground floor. There’s 
only one other permanent resi¬ 
dent at the Hyatt, an elderly lady 
who has lived there for years. Lit¬ 
tle Richard paid her a visit on her 
86th birthday because, he said, 
“She’s the only neighbor I got!” 

We were also closely acquaint¬ 
ed with the “West Hollywood 
Sunset Strip Martini,” which will 
offend martini purists because it 
somehow involves orange juice 
and a “slap” of Cointreau. Ouch. 
Partly as a result of this invention, 
we never made it to our next en¬ 
gagement, a wine-tasting extrava¬ 
ganza at Mecca. Sorry, Isosceles 
Group. We’re really not Mecca 
girls anyway. Give us another slap! 


Blue Period 


Pride before the fall 

It’s still more than a week be¬ 
fore the parade, but already the 
traditional grousing over SF Pride 
festivities has begun heating up. 
Welcome to Pride Month. San 
Jose Pride gets Ru Paul, and SF 
Pride gets Boy George — wait a 
minute, Boy George has decided 
he has better things to do, like 
anything. Let’s try that again. San 
Jose gets RuPaul, SF Pride gets 
Blue Period. That’s right, upstart 
neo-glamourists and BAR house 
band (well, sorta) Blue Period will 
be playing the Main Stage Sunday 
at 5:40 p.m. BAR design wizard 
Adrian Roberts will be the glam- 
ourpuss in the dress that suggests, 
“Don’t Choke On Your Pride™.” 

Close encounters 
of the Morris kind 

There he was again, genius 
choreographer Mark Morris, sit¬ 
ting right across the aisle from us 
at last Friday night’s performance 
of his inspired staging of Jean- 
Philippe Rameau’s “ballet bouf- 
fon” Platee in Berkeley. The 
comedie lyrique by one of the mu¬ 
sical genii of the 18th Century, res¬ 
cued by one of the 20th Century’s, 
was a bundle of stimulation and 
delight (see ace classical critic 
Stephanie von Buchau’s re¬ 
view), but from our vantage point 
the show was almost upstaged by 
Morris in the flesh. With a queen¬ 
ly flourish he produced a large 
white disco fan and proceeded to 
fan himself (with good reason: the 
confines of good old Zellerbach 



Mark Morris 



Hall can be stuffy indeed) ... and 
we were cooled! 

Our last such close encounter 
with the kinky-curled genius was 
at the Ballet. Now we’re two for 
two. But we’ve really got to stop 
meeting like this. Next time, Mr. 
M, meet us on the back patio of 
the Lone Star — and don’t bother 
to dress up. 


Antenna Theater's Pandemonium. 


Pulling our antenna 

While we enjoy our brushes 
with glamour, we know it’s im¬ 
portant to keep the home fires 
burning, too. Our buddy-boy 
Thing has never quite forgiven us 
for failing to get tickets to that 
Vietnamese water puppets ex¬ 
travaganza a while back. To make 
it up to him, we took Thing and 
our friend the Foreign Corre¬ 
spondent to a performance of the 
Antenna Theater’s walk-through 
theater out in the Marin Head¬ 
lands last week. Artistic Director 
Chris Hardman’s celebrated 
“Walkmanology” productions 
have the audience wired up with 
headsets and romping through 
fields and forest to witness giant 
puppets acting out the exploits of 
nymphs and satyrs. Pandemoni¬ 
um is a delightful paean to spring¬ 
time, romance, and the whims of 
Pan. Thing thrilled to the bun- 
raku puppets and giant appari¬ 
tions. Highly recommended, 
through July 12. Call 331-8512. 



Michael Tilson Thomas 


Buzzing the Bowl 

When musical director 
Michael Tilson Thomas con¬ 
ducts the San Francisco Sympho¬ 
ny in the Mahler Eighth next 
week, we wonder if he’ll be think¬ 
ing of a performance of the Eighth 
he gave at the Hollywood Bowl, 
visited from the air by a most un¬ 
wanted audience in a chopper: 

“The helicopter noise got loud¬ 
er and louder just as the orchestra 
was playing this most quiet music... 
this horrible, deafening drone,” 
MTT writes in his book Viva Voce. 
“Something just snapped in my 
brain, and I yelled out, ‘Basta cosi!’ 
I broke my baton, threw it down 
and walked off the stage.” 

It turned out the helicopter be¬ 
longed to the police department 
of an L.A. suburb, who cooked up 
the lame excuse that they were 
pursuing a suspect known to be a 
fan of classical music. “Only when 
we threatened them with paying 
the overtime charges for the entire 
ensemble did they beat a hasty re¬ 
treat and buzz off.” T

Boys’ shorts 

◄ page 38 

Arriving in San Francisco last 
September, Dimas set about com¬ 
posing a film elegy to the univer¬ 
sal feelings of grief and loss. The 
resulting film, Breath, is a haunt¬ 
ing evocation of a young man’s re¬ 
alization that his lover is dying. 
Composed in four acts or dances, 
Breath shows the loneliness of 
grief, the young man’s attempts at 
solace through anonymous sex 
(the peculiar aesthetics of video 
render this scene appropriately 
hellish), the different ways the 
dying man’s parents assuage their 
sense of loss, and a stunningly 
beautiful coda where the two 
lovers kiss underwater. Dimas 
portrays life’s ultimate experience 
through compelling water motifs 
supported by a brilliant musical 
score combining Irene Pappas, 
Radiohead, and Nina Simone. 
Breath shows on the Elegies And 
Negotiations program (Noon, 
6/27, Victoria) along with Rubber 
Gloves, an oddly funny AIDS 
lament by local filmmaker Tom E. 
Brown, whose Ed Wood parody, 
Don’t Run Johnny, was a big hit at 
last year’s festival. 

Ever had the experience of 
eavesdropping on two close 
friends spilling their hearts out to 
each other on Muni? This is the 
kind of experience filmmaker 
Doug Wolens offers in his bisexu¬ 
al sit-com In Frame, as we hear 
two twentysomething women 
kvetch about sex. Lisa (Jennifer 
Davis) is fed up with an aggres¬ 
sively passive boyfriend, while 
Jane (Marcy Willis) is doing great 
with Harry and some girls on the 
side. For six minutes all we see is 
Kasha the German Shepard while 
Jane and Lisa tutor us in Bisexu¬ 
ality 101. On the same Bi Boys 
And Bi Girls program (6/22, 6:30 
p.m., Victoria), Bret Hofstein’s Fu- 
turePresentPast presents many 
views of a gay boy/bi girl menage. 
A sexy cast headed up by the ever- 
versatile Craig Chester makes this 
film within a film triangle sizzle 
and provoke. 

Is there such a thing as tasteful 
porn? Consider These Are A Few 
Of My Favorite Things, Nguyen 
Tan Hoang’s dissection of the 
power relationships in sex be¬ 
tween white boys and Asians. 
Mixing provocatively hard-core 
images with Broadway show 
tunes, Hoang shows how easy it is 
to be silly and sexy. My Favorite 
Things leads off both the Porn 
Dogs and Bay Boys programs 
(6/25, 11 p.m., Roxie; 6/26, 10:30 
p.m., Roxie). Also on the Porn 
Dogs program, Canadian film¬ 
maker Steve Reinke catches a 
young man musing about his 
home decor while having a wank 
in Andy — an amusing idea that 
runs out steam when it becomes a 
little bit too Canadian. 

‘Banana boy’ 

Yellow Fever (6/20, 9:30 p.m., 
Victoria) is an excellent shorts 
program from Asian communi¬ 
ties in America, Canada, Britain 
and Hong Kong, on the erotic 
dilemmas faced by gay Asian men 
in predominantly white societies. 
The title piece is a witty sit-com 
about the plight of an English 
“banana boy” (an Asian man who 
dates white men) who suddenly 
acquires an attractive and sexual¬ 
ly aggressive Chinese neighbor. 
On the same program, China 
Dolls is an Australian documen¬ 
tary with a cast of Asian Aussies 
who speak candidly about their 
country’s racial history and what 
it feels like to be at the bottom of 
society’s sexual pecking order. 

The gay teen program, One Of 
Them (6/23, 4 p.m., Victoria), 
gives three perspectives on the 



Bavo Defurne's Sailor 


sexual turmoil of adolescent boys. 
In A Good Son, 16-year-old 
Joseph has barricaded himself be¬ 
hind a copy of Dickens’ Bleak 
House and a Walkman full of The 
Velvet Underground. Attending a 
diving competition with his 
younger brother, Joseph is swept 
off his feet by an older boy with a 
way with Rimbaud and a hash 
pipe. Ahead lies a rooftop seduc¬ 
tion and an uneasy glimpse at the 
future. Stanley Beloved explores 
the perpetually horny days and 
nights of a pair of Hong Kong 


teens, whose parents belong to the 
former colony’s privileged inter¬ 
national minority. Kevin sneaks a 
night beach kiss on the lips of his 
best buddy James on the day his 
father acts to terminate their 
friendship The most poignant 
story of the trilogy is the title 
piece, which portrays the com¬ 
radeship of two teenage style 
queens amidst the stifling confor¬ 
mity of 1965 New Zealand. One 
of the boys is overtly queeny, but 
his friend refuses to face up to the 
implications of their relationship. 
Intolerable pressures lead the duo 
on a brief homophobic rampage 
before a near-tragic showdown. 

Rules Of The Game (6/22, 4 
p.m., Victoria) is one of the best of 
the gay youth-oriented film pro¬ 
grams. Winner of the longest title 
for the shortest film is Thirza Jean 
Cuthand’s Working Babydyke The¬ 
ory: Diasporic Impact of Cross- 
Generational Barriers: a young les¬ 
bian laments the condescending 
attitudes of older women she’s 
dated. In the title piece, several gay, 
lesbian and transgendered stu¬ 
dents at New York’s Harvey Milk 
High School tell their life stories 
and concoct fantasies about their 
futures in a superbly produced 
German documentary. The kids’ 
dreams are given the best possible 
production values. ▼

, ow that IML is history, the 
summer months loom 
ahead, bulging with leather 
activities for you to plan your va¬ 
cations around. The bar, city, state 
and regional Drummer contests

tend the Mr. Mid-Atlantic Drum¬

Eagle. The Mid-Atlantic Drum¬ 
mer competition is being closely 
watched because of a new entry, 
Mr. Pennsylvania Drummer Scott 
Reikofski and Drummer Boy

for that state. (They just held the 
Mr. D.C. Drummer contest last 



Mr. July Ben Greenwell (I) won the

Benefits Counselors. Danny 
Williams emcees. For more info,

those little block parties that has 
blossomed into a major event, 
with people coming to SF just for 
this day. Details as they become

Colorado’s leather communi¬ 
ties do themselves proud once 
more with their Thunder in the

In September, San Francisco 
Leather Pride Week kicks off on

Pride Walk from the Castro to 
Folsom. All the events for Leather 
Pride Week are not finalized yet; 
however, there will be the Fetish 8c 
Fantasy Ball, Mr. Drummer’s Last 
Supper, and the aforementioned 
IMD contests and Folsom Street 
Fair. Understand that this sum¬ 
mer fun list is by no means com¬ 
plete, but it will help fill your so¬ 
cial calendar! 

Back at the ranch 

The 1999 Bare Chest Calendar 
contests closed June 11 with all 12 
winners competing to see who 
would be on the cover. Judges 
Ingu Yun, Jerry Roberts, Graylin 
Thornton, Mark Seeba and 
Daniel Sonnenfeld had a tough 
time making their choice. Howev¬ 
er, Mr. July 1999 Ben Greenwell, 
56, won the spot. The runner-up 
and back cover winner is Mr. 
April Paul Tucci. Miller Brewing 
and Golden Brands have gone all 
out to support the calendar. You 
can see all 12 winners on a special 
float in the pride parade. 

Hey, Mister S has just come out

A tale of two tiaras 



by Sweet Lips 


ell! I most definitely got 
an earful on my answer¬ 
ing machine as regards 
that blind item about the “former 
royal mucketymuck” in my last 
column. My delicate shell-like 
protuberances may have been 
permanently violated! It seems 
that I offended a certain illustri¬ 
ous title-holder who bellowed 
most vociferously that I had be¬ 
trayed my fellow blue bloods (I 
am a czarina and an empress, after 
all) by reporting on her decidedly 
tawdry activities. The only prob¬ 
lem is that my little tale of woe re¬ 
ferred to another titan of the 
tiaras, not the haranguing harpy 
who desecrated my princess 
phone. However, dear, I am sorry 
to hear about your troubles. 
Maybe if you spent less time pub¬ 
licizing them, people wouldn’t 
cross to the other side of the street 
every time they caught sight of 
you barreling their way. 

The assault above, recorded for 
posterity on tape, so jangled my 
nerves that I fled to my bedside 
companion (no, not the Jelly 
Vibro Tube), the Tao Te Ching, for 
a little solace. I happened to flip 
open to the exceedingly apropos 
Chapter 55 and found these com¬ 
forting words: “He who is filled 
with Virtue is like a newborn 
child./ Wasps and serpents will 
not sting him;/ Wild beasts will 
not pounce upon him;/ He 
will not be attacked 
by birds of prey./ ^ 

His bones are soft, Oj 
his muscles weak,/ ( 

But his grip is 
firm./ He has not 
experienced the 
union of man 
and woman 
[that’s me!], but 
is whole./ His 
manhood is strong./ He screams 
all day without becoming hoarse 
[ditto!]./ This is perfect harmony./ 
Knowing harmony is constancy./ 
Knowing constancy is enlighten¬ 
ment./ It is not wise to rush 
about./ Controlling the breath 
causes strain./ If too much energy 
is used, exhaustion follows./ This 
is not the way of Tao./ Whatever 
is contrary to Tao will not last 
long.” Needless to say, / am not 
contrary to Tao. 

Famed Empress I Jose Sarria 
will be signing copies of her 
brand-spanking new book, The 
Empress Is a Man (Harrington 
Park Press, $19.95), at Castro’s A 


Different Light Bookstore on 
Monday, June 22, at 7:30 p.m. Jose 
is a true legend, and not surpris¬ 
ingly, the book is a real 
treat — a hilarious 
page-turner you’d be a 
fool to miss! 

Closet Ball update: 
The mist is lifting, the 
clouds are parting, and 
yes, the 25th Closet 
Ball will be taking 
place on Satur¬ 
day, August 8, at 
the GiftCenter 
Pavilion (Eighth 
and Harrison) at 7:30 p.m. Dennis 
“Nestea and Nasturtiums” Tyler is 
creating a dazzling array of table 
munchies that can be ordered 
along with your tickets ($20-$60) 
at the Giraffe Chandelier Lounge 
only (not Marlena’s). Call 474- 
1702 for more information. 

Another must-attend event is 
the faboo Pink Party at the Polk 
Rendezvous on Saturday, June 27, 
at 7 p.m. in the Pink Flamingo 
Room, featuring DJ Damjen. No 
cover if you wear pink! The next 
day, June 28, is Gay Pride Day in 
Faghdad by the Bay. The PR is 
throwing a pre-parade party start¬ 
ing at 9 a.m., with beer to go. After 


the day’s festivities, drop on by 
with your parade pickup for a 
post-parade pick-me-up at our 
tea dance (4 p.m.). 

I had a nice letter from that 
wonderful Michael Greer ( For¬ 
tune and Men's Eyes), who’s open¬ 
ing at the air-conditioned Top Hat 
Playhouse in Palm Springs in July. 
He’ll be starring in A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the 
Forum. It’s hard to believe that it’s 
been almost 30 years since La 
Greer camped his way into every¬ 
one’s hearts as the sensationally 
swishy landlord Malcolm in The 
Gay Deceivers! 

David Slocomb’s “Every Penny 
Counts” sidewalk sale raised 
$1,800 (!) for the AIDS Emer¬ 
gency Fund last week. Thanks go 
to all the great volunteers, espe¬ 
cially Marie. 

That lucky Dick Deemer! The 
photo that accompanies this col¬ 
umn shows Dick and his hunky 
co-workers at the Fire Island 
Pines. Can you pick out the 62- 
year-old in the pic? Hint: He’s the 
one not showing off his bod! And 
Dick, why is that young honey 
grinding his tush into your nether 
regions? Never knew you were a 
top, doll! ▼
