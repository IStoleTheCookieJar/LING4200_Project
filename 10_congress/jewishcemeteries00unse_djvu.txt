Message  from  the  Chair 


One  of  the  principal  missions  that  United  States  law  assigns  the  Commission  for  the 
Preservation  of  America's  Heritage  Abroad  is  to  identify  and  report  on  cemeteries, 
monuments,  and  historic  buildings  in  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  associated  with  the 
cultural  heritage  of  U.S.  citizens,  especially  endangered  sites. 

The  Congress  and  the  President  were  prompted  to  establish  the  Commission  because  of 
the  special  problem  faced  by  Jewish  sites  in  the  region.  The  populations  that  had  once 
cared  for  the  properties  were  annihilated  during  the  Holocaust.  The  atheistic  Communist 
Party  dictatorships  that  succeeded  the  Nazis  throughout  most  of  the  region  were 
insensitive  to  American  Jewish  concerns  about  preservation  of  the  sites.  Properties  were 
converted  to  other  uses  or  encroached  upon  by  development.  Natural  deterioration  was 
not  counteracted.  Vandalism  often  went  unchecked. 

This  report  identifies  and  discusses  Jewish  cemeteries,  synagogues,  and  mass  gravesites 
in  the  Republic  of  Lithuania.  I  hope  that  the  report  will  encourage  preservation  efforts 
and  assist  American  Jews  of  Lithuanian  descent  to  connect  with  the  last  remnants  of  their 
heritage  in  Lithuania. 

The  Commission  is  also  required  by  U.S.  law  to  seek  assurances  from  the  governments  of 
the  region  regarding  the  protection  and  preservation  of  these  cultural  heritage  properties. 

I  am  pleased  to  note  that  the  governments  of  the  United  States  and  Lithuania  entered  into 
a  Commission-negotiated  agreement  regarding  the  protection  and  preservation  of  certain 
cultural  properties  in  2002.  The  agreement  covers  the  sites  identified  in  this  report.

A  report  on  a  survey  for  the  U.S.  Commission  for  the  Preservation 

of  America’s  Heritage  Abroad 


I.  Origin,  Mission,  and  Development  of  the  Survey 

In  Vilnius,  Lithuania,  on  October  15th,  2002,  then  Commission  Chairman  Warren  L. 
Miller  and  Lithuania's  Minister  of  Culture,  Roma  Dovydeniene,  signed  an  Agreement 
between  the  United  States  and  Lithuania  on  the  Protection  and  Preservation  of  Certain 
Cultural  Properties.  Article  5  of  the  Agreement  provides  that  “properties  of  cultural 
heritage...  that  are  of  special  significance  shall  be  designated  in  the  lists  of  items  of 
cultural  heritage.  Such  lists  shall  be  publicly  announced  and  communicated  to  competent 
federal,  state,  and  local  authorities.” 

In  accordance  with  the  Agreement  and  the  U.S.  law  that  established  the  Commission,  the 
Commission  initiated  surveys  in  Lithuania  to  identify,  inventory,  and  describe  cultural 
heritage  property  of  groups  that,  according  to  Article  4  of  the  Agreement,  are  “unable  .  .  . 
to  ensure  adequate  protection  and  preservation  of’  such  sites. 

In  cooperation  with  the  Jewish  Communities  of  Lithuania,  a  survey  of  Jewish  cemeteries 
and  mass  gravesites  was  conducted  from  2001  through  2003.  This  is  a  report  on  the 
findings  of  that  survey. 

A  survey  related  to  Old  Believer  Christian  sites  was  also  conducted.  The  Commission 
published  a  report  on  the  survey  of  Old  Believer  sites  in  2006. 

In  the  survey  of  Jewish  sites,  teams  visited  and  described  399  Jewish  cemeteries  and 
Holocaust  sites.  Sometimes,  a  single  site  might  be  listed  twice,  such  as  a  cemetery  that 
also  contains  a  Holocaust  mass  grave.  Clusters  of  mass  graves,  however,  are  only  counted 
once.  Subsequently,  information  was  also  gathered  about  synagogues  from  various 
sources. 

The  survey  collected  data  regarding  the  location,  condition,  and  ownership,  etc.  of  Jewish 
cemeteries  and  Holocaust  sites  in  Lithuania  to  facilitate  the  Commission's  efforts  to 
encourage  Lithuanian  government  and  private  efforts  to  protect  and  preserve  the  sites. 
Records  of  the  Jewish  Communities  of  Lithuania  were  used  to  identify  the  location  of 
Jewish  sites.  A  priority  was  placed  on  creating  an  inventory  of  sites  that  have  been 
seriously  abused  or  desecrated. 

II.  A  Brief  History  of  Jewish  Settlement  in  Lithuania 

Lithuania  has  a  long  history  as  a  center  of  Jewish  life  and  learning.  Until  the  Holocaust, 
Jews  had  lived  and  flourished  for  centuries  in  the  territory  that  comprises  the  present 
country.  Jews  trace  their  origins  in  Lithuania  to  the  days  of  Grand  Duke  Gediminas,  who 
founded  the  first  Lithuanian  state  in  the  14th  century.  By  the  late  15th  century,  there  were 
already  thriving  Jewish  communities. 

The  Jews  of  Lithuania  had  an  influence  on  Jewish  society  in  Poland  and  other  countries 
that  was  greater  than  their  numbers  might  suggest.  From  the  19th  century  until  the 
Holocaust,  Vilnius  was  one  of  the  world’s  major  Jewish  centers;  renowned  as  the 


1 


“Jerusalem  of  Lithuania.”  The  culture  of  Litvak  Jewry  can  still  be  seen  in  Jewish 
traditions  worldwide. 

Lithuania’s  Jews  boasted  a  highly  developed  system  of  education  and  publishing  based 
on  two  languages,  Yiddish  and  Hebrew,  and  they  also  involved  themselves  in  a  broad 
range  of  international  movements,  from  the  esoteric  and  idealistic  Esperanto  movement 
to  politically  and  religiously  motivated  Zionism.  Among  the  many  institutions  in  pre-war 
Lithuania  were  the  Jewish  Institute  for  Research  (YIVO)  and  major  centers  of  Orthodox 
religious  thought  and  education,  including  world-renowned  yeshivot  (educational 
institutions  for  study  of  the  Torah  and  other  traditional  texts  central  to  Judaism)  at  Telsiai 
(Telz)  and  Slobodka  (today  Vilijampole). 

The  great  18th-century  sage,  the  Gaon  of  Vilna,  mathematician  Hermann  Minkovski, 
world-famous  violinist  Joshua  Heifetz,  sculptors  Mark  Antokolski  and  Jacques  Lipchitz, 
painter  Isaac  Levitan,  novelist  Abraham  Mapu,  and  scores  of  other  creative  individuals 
were  bom  and  raised  in  this  culturally  fertile  environment.  An  effort  began  in  2003  to 
place  plaques  at  locations  in  Vilnius  associated  with  the  lives  of  many  of  these 
luminaries. 

On  the  eve  of  the  Holocaust,  there  were  about  160,000  Jews  in  Lithuania.  Another  60,000 
Jews  lived  in  the  Vilnius  area,  which  was  part  of  Poland  at  the  time.  It  was  transferred  to 
Lithuania  after  the  Soviet  conquest  of  eastern  Poland  in  1939.  During  the  German 
occupation  of  Lithuania,  which  began  in  1941,  about  95%  of  these  Jews  were  killed— a 
greater  percentage  than  in  any  other  community  in  Europe.  Non-Jewish  Lithuanians 
participated  in  the  killings. 

Although  Lithuania  was  part  of  the  post- World  War  II  USSR,  under  Communism,  Jews 
in  Soviet  Lithuania  benefited  from  a  slightly  more  relaxed  atmosphere  than  in  Soviet 
Russia.  In  Vilnius,  certain  limited  expressions  of  Jewish  culture  were  tolerated.  Still,  it 
was  impossible  to  sustain  a  normal  Jewish  community  in  Lithuania  until  the  late  1 980s, 
when  a  strong  national  movement  permitted  the  development  of  a  Jewish  cultural 
movement  as  well. 

1.  Jewish  Life  and  Jewish  Cultural  Sites  in  Lithuania  Today 

Lithuania  became  independent  in  1991  with  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  In  the 
1990s,  it  began  to  grapple  with  the  facts  of  its  history,  particularly  the  periods  of  Nazi  and 
Soviet  occupation.  Open  discussion  of  events,  practices,  and  issues  was  clouded  by 
contemporary  political  meaning.  It  was  clear,  however,  that  failure  to  confront  the  past 
would  lead  to  serious  problems  in  the  development  of  the  new  nation  as  a  democracy  that 
would  be  respected  internationally.  Recognizing  this,  President  Valdas  Adamkus  signed  a 
decree  on  September  7  ,  1998  that  established  an  International  Commission  for  the 
Evaluation  of  the  Crimes  of  the  Nazi  and  Soviet  Occupation  Regimes  in  Lithuania. 

In  October  2000,  a  major  conference  was  held  in  Vilnius  on  the  topic  of  Holocaust-era 
looted  assets.  This  meeting  helped  establish  an  ongoing  effort  to  restore  cultural  assets. 


2 


Upon  regaining  its  independence.  Lithuania  had  dropped  all  restrictions  on  Jewish 
religious  and  cultural  life.  Today,  there  is  a  small,  but  vital.  Jewish  community  in  the 
country.  It  is  mostly  based  in  Vilnius,  but  there  is  a  community  of  more  than  400 
members  in  Kaunas,  with  smaller  Jewish  communities  in  Druskininkai,  Klaipeda 
(Memel),  Panevezys,  Plunge.  Siauliai.  Svencionys,  and  Ukmerge.  Many  of  these 
communities  have  fewer  than  two  dozen  members. 

Chabad  operates  an  active  center  in  Vilnius.  There  have  been  serious  conflicts  between 
the  Lithuanian  Jewish  Communities  and  Chabad.  but.  with  the  exception  of  the  temporary 
closing  of  the  main  Choral  synagogue  in  Vilnius  from  2004.  these  disagreements  have 
not  affected  religious  or  cultural  sites  within  the  country. 

2.  Jewish  Tourism  in  Lithuania 

The  revival  of  Jewish  life  in  Lithuania  has  also  attracted  the  interest  of  Jews  in  other 
countries,  manv  of  whom  trace  their  ancestrv  to  Lithuania.  Everv  year,  more  Jewish 
visitors  travel  to  Lithuania  to  learn  about  their  roots  and  to  visit  the  graves  of  their 
ancestors  or  revered  sages.  Some  have  become  involved  in  the  protection  and  restoration 
of  Jewish  cemeteries. 

Vilnius  is  the  prime  destination  in  Lithuania.  Most  national  tourism  efforts  have  focused 
on  improving  access  to  historic  sites  and  providing  better  accommodations  in  proximity 
to  sites.  Local  tour  companies  have  developed  cultural  tour  packages. 

Jewish  tourism  can  be  divided  into  two  main  types — large  group  tours,  including  from 
Israel,  and  smaller  “genealogy  tourism"  groups.  Guides  are  essential  because  there  is 
little  information  available  for  Jewish  heritage  travelers  to  facilitate  travel  on  their  own. 
There  are  few  brochures  or  guidebooks,  and  (although  this  is  changing)  very  little 
signage.  Jewish  sites  at  several  regional  centers,  however,  are  being  developed  as  tourist 
attractions  and  information  centers.  Recently,  new  online  travel  and  genealogy  resources 
can  be  found  on  the  Internet. 

Jewish  and  Holocaust-related  sites  in  Vilnius  and  Kaunas  are  well  known.  Some  are 
marked,  and  there  are  tours  with  knowledgeable  private  guides  available.  A  guide  to  100 
Jewish  sites  in  Vilnius  has  been  published  by  the  State  Museum. 

3.  Jewish  Museums 

The  Vilna  Gaon  State  Jewish  Museum  is  the  main  Lithuanian  center  for  research, 
collections,  and  exhibitions  of  Jewish  history  and  culture  in  the  country.  The  museum 
receives  a  small  amount  of  financial  support  from  the  Lithuanian  government.  Although 
this  is  augmented  by  private  contributions,  the  museum  is  chronically  under-funded. 

This  is  the  third  Jewish  museum  to  operate  in  Vilnius  over  the  past  century.  The  first 
opened  in  1913,  when  local  intellectuals  established  a  Society  of  Lovers  of  Jewish 
Antiquity  and  a  museum.  Most  of  its  collection  was  destroyed  during  World  War  I.  After 


1919,  the  Society  and  the  museum  were  revived,  but  the  contents  of  the  museum  were 
nearly  all  destroyed  during  World  War  II. 

The  second  Jewish  museum  was  started  after  the  Soviet  liberation  in  1944  by  survivors  of 
the  Nazi  occupation.  They  extracted  damaged  paintings,  sculpture,  books,  letters  of 
famous  Jewish  writers,  the  diary  of  Zionist  movement  founder  Theodor  Herzl,  and  other 
valuable  documents  out  of  cellars,  attics,  and  pits.  This  museum  had  a  very  short  life: 
Soviet  authorities  closed  it  in  June  1949,  and  its  collection  was  scattered  among  other 
Lithuanian  museums  and  archives. 

On  October  1st,  1989,  Lithuanian  authorities  permitted  the  opening  of  the  third  museum. 
Emanuelis  Zingeris,  a  young  academic,  was  the  first  Chairman.  (Zingeris  later  became 
the  first  Jewish  member  of  the  Lithuanian  parliament.) 

The  initiative  for  the  museum  came  from  the  Lithuanian  Cultural  Foundation.  Part  of  its 
current  collection  was  obtained  from  the  M.K.  Ciurlionis  art  museum  and  other 
Lithuanian  museums.  The  collection  now  consists  of  more  than  4,000  artifacts, 
photographs,  art  pieces,  documents,  and  books.  Among  these  are  ritual  items  salvaged 
from  the  Great  Synagogue,  which  was  dynamited  by  the  Nazis  and  then  demolished  in 
1957  by  the  Soviet  regime.  These  include  parts  of  the  original  ark  and  reader’s  desk.  The 
museum  also  includes  a  section  devoted  to  the  destruction  of  Lithuanian  Jewry. 

The  museum  has  been  able  to  implement  a  substantial  number  of  programs  thanks  to 
international  foundations,  such  as  the  Claims  Conference  and  the  Anti-Defamation 
League  in  the  U.S.,  smaller  donors,  and  foreign  embassies.  The  Vilna  Gaon  State  Jewish 
Museum  has  also  established  contacts  with  museums  worldwide. 

The  museum  displays  its  exhibitions  in  several  sites.  These  include  a  small  but  powerful 
exhibition  about  the  Holocaust  in  a  building  known  as  the  Green  House  at  Pamenkalnio 
Street  12;  the  graphic  depiction  is  required  viewing  for  many  students  and  for  military 
units.  In  addition,  a  Tolerance  Center  was  opened  in  2001  in  connection  with  the  60 
anniversary  of  the  establishment  of  the  Nazis'  Vilnius  ghetto.  It  is  located  in  what  was  a 
pre-war  Jewish  theatre.  Much  of  the  funding  came  from  the  French  and  German 
governments. 

There  are  a  few  smaller  museums  with  Jewish  content  in  the  country.  The  State  Jewish 
Museum  operates  the  Museum  of  Jacques  Lipchitz  (1897-1973)  devoted  to  the  world- 
famous  sculptor  in  his  native  town  of  Druskininkai.  There  are  also  small  exhibits  on 
Jewish  history  in  the  town  museums  of  Joniskis  and  in  Kedainiai.  The  former  Winter 
Synagogue  of  Kedainiai,  administered  by  the  Kedainiai  Regional  Museum,  houses  a 
small  display  of  Judaica  in  its  women’s  gallery. 

There  have  been  plans  for  a  small  Jewish  museum  in  Plunge,  where  the  Jewish 
community  has  often  organized  exhibitions.  There  were  about  100  items  for  the  core  of  a 
permanent  exhibition.  There  has  also  been  discussion  of  a  museum  in  Kalvarija,  when  the 
synagogue  complex  there  is  restored.

In  Kaunas,  the  house  where  Japanese  Consul  Chiune  Sugihara  and  his  wife  issued  visas 
tor  Japan  in  1941  to  thousands  of  Jewish  refugees  who  had  fled  to  Kaunas  from  Poland 
has  been  turned  into  a  small  museum  and  study  center.  It  is  located  at  Vaizganto  30.  Most 
of  the  refugees  managed  to  eventually  reach  Shanghai,  China. 

4.  Other  Jewish  Institutions 

The  Vilnius  Yiddish  Institute  is  the  first  Yiddish  center  of  higher  learning  in  post- 
Holocaust  Eastern  Europe.  It  has  an  active  program  of  research  and  study  of  Yiddish 
language  and  culture.  The  Institute  was  founded  by  Jewish  scholars  from  the  United 
States  and  Israel  working  with  Lithuanian  academics.  It  is  a  part  of  Vilnius  University. 


III.  Overview:  Jewish  Monuments  in  Lithuania 

There  is  a  considerable  amount  of  literature  on  the  Jewish  history  and  culture  of 
Lithuania,  beginning  with  detailed  studies  carried  out  before  World  War  II.  This  work 
has  been  continued  in  recent  years  with  studies  of  the  Holocaust  and  its  effects  upon 
Lithuanian  Jewry.  Until  recently,  however,  the  study  did  not  include  substantial  research 
on  Jewish  art,  architecture,  and  cemeteries. 

In  1997.  a  photo  exhibition  was  held  regarding  Lithuanian  synagogues  that  drew  attention 
to  many  of  the  surviving  buildings.  Studies  by  the  Center  for  Jewish  Art  of  Hebrew 
University  in  Jerusalem  and  by  individual  researchers  generated  considerable  information 
on  the  state  of  Jewish  sites  in  Lithuania,  especially  surviving  wooden  synagogues.  This 
research  came  to  fruition  with  the  publication  of  the  two-volume  comprehensive,  heavily 
documented  and  illustrated  catalogue,  Synagogues  in  Lithuania ,  published  by  the  Vilnius 
Academy  of  Arts  Press  in  2010  and  2012. 

Perhaps  the  best-known  Jewish  site  in  the  country  is  that  of  the  historic  Shulhof,  a  now- 
destroyed  complex  of  dozens  of  connected  Jewish  buildings  around  a  central  court,  which 
once  was  a  hub  of  Lithuanian  Jewish  life.  The  complex  was  partly  destroyed  by  Germans 
in  1941.  After  the  war,  the  Soviets  demolished  it  completely.  Loremost  among  the 
buildings  was  the  Great  City  Synagogue,  a  one-story,  Renaissance-Baroque  stone 
synagogue  built  in  1630-33,  which  replaced  the  Old  Synagogue,  originally  built  in  1572. 
The  Great  Synagogue  was  surrounded  by  20  smaller  synagogues,  the  beit  midrash  (study 
house),  the  mikveh  (ritual  bath),  the  Community  Building,  the  “Strashun"  Rabbinical 
Library,  and  the  kloyz  (or  “Small  Synagogue'’)  built  in  1800  and  dedicated  to  the  Gaon  of 
Vilna  (Rabbi  Eliyahu  of  Vilna.  1720-1797). 

Todav,  a  statue  of  the  Gaon  on  the  site  of  his  house  commemorates  this  lost  center.  City 

•'  th  •  • 

officials  erected  the  statue  in  1997  to  mark  the  200  anniversary  of  his  death.  The  Gaon 
was  originally  buried  in  the  Snipiskes  Jewish  Cemetery.  The  Sarunas  Hotel  and  Sports 
Palace  was  built  during  the  Soviet  period  over  part  of  the  cemetery.  At  that  time,  the 
remains  of  the  Gaon  and  a  few  other  people  were  moved  to  the  new  Jewish  cemetery  in 
the  Seskine  district,  which  is  still  in  use  by  the  community.

The  site  of  the  former  Shulhof  is  in  the  heart  of  the  former  Jewish  quarter  of  Vilnius, 
where  Jews  lived  for  centuries.  The  Nazis  used  the  area  as  the  location  for  two  ghettos, 

fL 

both  established  on  September  6  ,1941. 

Today,  plaques  indicate  the  boundaries  of  the  Small  and  Large  Ghettos.  The  Small 
Ghetto  (or  Second)  was  located  in  the  old  medieval  Jewish  quarter  and  housed  between 
9,000  and  1 1,000  people.  Most  were  taken  to  the  Paneriai  (Ponary)  forest  outside  Vilnius 
and  killed  during  the  approximately  six  weeks  of  its  existence  as  a  killing  center,  from 
September  6th  to  October  21st,  1941.  The  Large  Ghetto,  in  a  neighboring  area,  contained 
more  than  20,000  people,  many  of  whom  performed  slave  labor.  It  existed  until 
September  23rd,  1943  when  it  was  “liquidated,”  and  those  Jews  still  imprisoned  there 
were  killed. 

The  beautiful  Old  Town  of  Kaunas  has  a  large  main  square  with  cobbled  streets  and 
buildings  ranging  from  the  medieval  period  to  the  1 920s.  The  area  includes  several  streets 
that  were  once  part  of  the  Jewish  quarter.  On  some  streets,  buildings  have  been 
beautifully  restored.  At  least  one  building  still  retains  a  trace  of  where  a  mezuzah  (a  piece 
of  parchment,  often  contained  in  a  decorative  case,  inscribed  with  a  Jewish  prayer  from 
the  Torah  affixed  to  the  front  doorframe)  was  attached  at  its  door,  evidence  that  Jews 
once  occupied  the  building. 

The  Ohel  Yaakov  Choral  Synagogue  of  Kaunas,  still  in  use  by  the  Jewish  community, 
dates  from  the  early  1870s.  A  memorial  to  1,600-1,800  children  killed  at  the  Ninth  Fort  is 
behind  the  synagogue.  Three  other  synagogues  also  survive  in  the  Old  Town.  One,  at 
Zamenhofo  7  and  9  was  restored  in  2003-5  for  use  as  a  conference  hall.  (The  structures  of 
eight  masonry  synagogues  survive  in  Kaunas  as  a  whole.) 

Throughout  Lithuania,  many  Jewish  cemeteries  and  massacre  sites  are  well  marked  and 
now  have  monuments  as  a  result  of  a  collaborative  effort  of  the  Jewish  Communities  of 
Lithuania  and  national  and  local  governments  in  the  early  1990s.  These  monuments  are 
recorded  and  described  in  Yosif  Levinson’s  work,  The  Book  of  Sorrow  (Vilnius  1997) 
and  in  the  Lithuanian  Holocaust  Atlas,  by  Milda  Jakulyte- Vasil  (Vilnius  201 1).  A  small 
number  of  former  synagogues  have  been  adapted  for  other  cultural  use,  or  are  presently 
being  slowly  restored  for  cultural  purposes.  In  2013,  the  Jewish  Community  of  Lithuania 
was  working  with  the  municipalities  of  Pakruojis,  Kaisiadorys,  and  Mazeikiai  to  preserve 

V 

three  wooden  synagogues — those  in  Pakruojis,  Ziezmariai,  and  Seda. 

In  November  2013,  Faina  Kukliansky,  the  Chair  of  the  Jewish  Community  in  Lithuania, 
reported  to  the  Website  jewish-hertiage-europe.eu  about  progress  protecting  Lithuania’s 
wooden  synagogues  and  study  houses — 14  altogether.  All  of  these  are  fairly  simple 
buildings  that  probably  survived  destruction  due  to  their  relatively  nondescript 
appearance.  Pakruojis  synagogue,  first  built  in  1801,  is  the  oldest  and  most  valuable.  It 
suffered  severe  damage  in  a  fire  in  2009.  In  2013,  the  Jewish  Community  secured 
140,000  litas  (€40,500)  from  the  Lithuanian  national  budget  and  30.000  litas  (€8,700) 
from  the  Pakruojis  district  municipality  for  restoration  work.  Moreover,  a  long-term  lease 
contract  with  Pakruojis  district  municipality  was  signed  in  2010.

1.  Synagogues  and  Study  Houses 

In  Lithuania.  Jews  frequented  community  synagogues  and  study  houses  (singular:  beit 
midrash ,  plural:  batei  midrash )  as  well  as  private  prayer  and  study  halls,  known  as  kloyzn 
(singular:  kloyz ),  often  financed  by  a  well-to-do  patron  or  family.  These  latter  were  often 
founded  in  residential  buildings,  though  sometimes  purpose-built  structures  were  also 
erected.  It  is  estimated  that  before  the  war  there  were  between  96  and  1 20  synagogues 
and  prayer  houses  in  Vilnius  alone. 

Almost  100  former  synagogues  and  prayer  or  study  houses  can  still  be  identified  in  some 
form,  but  very  few  are  used  for  religious  purposes.  There  are  only  two  historic  synagogue 
buildings  in  active  use  by  Jewish  communities  in  Lithuania  today,  one  in  Vilnius  and  one 
in  Kaunas.  The  other  identified  Jewish  buildings  are  almost  all  in  poor  condition,  or  have 
been  adapted  to  new  uses  and  extensively  remodeled.  In  2010  and  2012.  as  previously 
noted,  the  Vilnius  Academy  of  Arts  Press  published  a  comprehensive  catalogue  of  extant 
buildings  that  once  served  or  still  are  in  use  as  synagogues,  study  houses,  and  prayer  halls 
throughout  Lithuania.  Although  the  inventory  does  not  include  many  residential  buildings 
in  Vilnius  that  once  also  housed  Jewish  prayer  halls,  the  catalogue  provides  extensive 
documentation  and  condition  descriptions  of  more  than  1 00  structures. 

In  Vilnius,  the  impressive  Choral  Synagogue  (Pvlimo  39)  was  built  in  1903  by 
Progressive  Jews.  It  survived  the  Holocaust  because  it  is  located  outside  the  traditional 
Jewish  district.  The  building,  with  its  mix  of  Romanesque  and  Moorish  detailing,  is 
typical  in  size  and  design  for  its  time.  The  facade  is  articulated  with  a  big  arch  topped  by 
a  Decalogue  (Ten  Commandments  tablets).  There  are  galleries  for  women,  a  central 
bimah  (the  elevated  area  or  platform  in  a  synagogue  where  a  person  reads  aloud  from  the 
Torah),  an  ornate  projecting  pulpit,  and  a  large  domed  tabernacle  through  which  one  must 
pass  in  order  to  reach  the  ark.  The  synagogue  has  recently  undergone  extensive 
restoration  and  structural  repair. 

The  Vilnius  Jewish  Community  owns  a  second  synagogue  at  6  Geliu  Street,  which  was 
for  many  years  in  danger  of  collapse.  It  was  stabilized  in  2014. 

The  Kaunas  Choral  Synagogue  is  located  on  E.  Ozeskienes  Street.  The  design  was 
presented  in  1872,  and  the  building  was  erected  shortly  thereafter. 

The  small  town  of  Trakai.  which  was  the  early,  medieval  capital  of  Lithuania,  has  had  a 
large  Karaite  Jewish  community.  On  one  street,  there  are  typical  Karaite  houses,  a 
Karaite  prayer  house,  or  kenesa.  and  the  small  Karaite  Ethnographic  Museum.  This 
museum  and  the  Vilna  Gaon  State  Jewish  Museum  are  the  only  two  official  museums 
dedicated  to  minority  culture  in  Lithuania.  (There  is  also  a  Karaite  kenesa  in  Vilnius.) 

In  Alytus.  there  is  an  old.  brick  former  synagogue  located  about  one  kilometer  from  the 
center  of  town,  but  only  the  shell  remains.  The  Jewish  community  cannot  afford  to  fix  the 
building  and  the  city  does  not  know  what  to  do  with  it.  although  it  is  noted  as  a  site  in 
local  tourism  information.

Synagogues  in  Kedainiai  have  been  restored  for  local  cultural  use,  and  those  in  Joniskis 
are  slowly  being  restored  for  use  as  museums.  In  each  of  these  towns,  as  well  as  in 
Kalvarija  (see  below),  there  still  survive  two  nearly-adjacent  masonry  synagogues,  the 
principal  remaining  elements  of  what  were  once  thriving  complexes  of  religious  and 
community  buildings.  The  project  at  Joniskis  received  early  funding  from  the  New  York- 
based  World  Monuments  Fund  but  was  hampered  when  part  of  one  of  the  synagogues 
collapsed  in  2007.  The  damage  was  repaired  and  the  building  has  now  been  restored  for 
cultural  use.  The  synagogue  in  Marijampole  has  also  been  restored  and  is  used  today  as  a 
teacher  training  center. 

Several  other  masonry  synagogues  survive.  They  mostly  date  from  the  19  century  and 
are  used  for  new  purposes.  Few  of  the  surviving  synagogues  retain  any  Jewish  identity  or 
any  modern  signs  or  markings  to  indicate  their  previous  use.  One  exception  is  the  former 
synagogue  in  Zemaiciq  Naumiestis  (Neishtot-Tavrig)  to  which  a  plaque  is  affixed  that 
reads:  “Here  until  June  22,  1941  was  the  synagogue  which  was  led  by  the  world  famous 
Rabbi  M.  Lesinas.”  In  2013,  however,  there  was  public  discussion  about  the  possible 
demolition  of  this  ruin.  In  recent  years,  a  small  number  of  commemorative  or  historical 
plaques  have  also  been  affixed  to  other  former  synagogues  or  prayer  halls,  including 
those  in  Panevezys  and  Pusalotas.  In  Vilnius,  there  is  a  memorial  plaque  on  the  building 
at  6  Gaono  Street  which  housed  the  Fish-Mongers’  -  Stitchers’  K/oyz  and  is  now  the 
Embassy  of  the  Republic  of  Austria.  Another  plaque  is  affixed  on  the  Feigelson's 
building  at  3  Ausros  Vartq  Street. 

A  complex  of  three  buildings  survives  in  Kalvarija,  a  small  locality  near  the  border  with 
Poland,  150  kilometers  west  of  Vilnius.  There  is  a  synagogue  and  a  large  beit  midrash , 
with  a  former  Talmud  Torah  school  situated  between  the  two.  Ownership  was  transferred 
to  the  Jewish  Communities  of  Lithuania  in  1993,  and  the  buildings  have  been  undergoing 
fitful  restoration  since  2001.  The  site  has  attracted  the  attention  of  national  cultural 
heritage  preservation  authorities  and  international  donors.  An  agreement  between  the 
Jewish  Communities  of  Lithuania  and  the  local  municipal  council  provides  for  alternative 
use  of  the  buildings.  Kalvarija  has  no  Jewish  community.  The  city  obtained  funds  from 
the  Ebelin  and  Gerdt  Buceri  ZEIT  Fund  (Germany),  which  were  matched  by  a  subsidy 
from  the  Lithuanian  Department  of  Cultural  Heritage  Preservation.  A  total  of  $300,000 
was  provided  for  the  project  which  has  resulted  in  the  partial  restoration  of  the  beit 
midrash  and  some  consolidation  of  synagogue  ruin. 

The  remains  of  about  1 5  wooden  synagogues  or  study  houses  can  be  identified  in 
Lithuania  (see  Table  I).  These  are  among  the  last  of  a  type  that  was  once  common 
throughout  much  of  the  area  that  is  now  northern  Poland,  as  well  as  parts  of  Ukraine  and 
Belarus,  in  addition  to  present  day  Lithuania.  Many  wooden  synagogues  were  destroyed 
in  World  War  I,  and  most  of  the  rest  were  destroyed  during  World  War  II,  when  the 
Nazis  pillaged  and  burned  synagogues.  All  but  one  of  the  Lithuanian  wooden  synagogues 
represents  a  late  phase  in  the  development  of  the  type,  and  all  are  fairly  simple  examples 
of  the  form.  Only  a  few  retain  any  trace  of  religious  decoration.  Preservation  has  been 
widely  advocated  in  recent  years.

Most  are  in  dilapidated  condition  and  many  are  empty.  Others  are  used  as  storerooms  or 
bams.  Several  have  been  threatened  with  demolition,  as  in  the  case  of  the  former 
synagogue  of  Rozalimas,  where  there  was  a  plan  to  re-use  the  wood  as  building  material. 
The  oldest  are  in  Pakruojis,  Tirksliai,  Ziezmariai.  and  Seda. 

Pakruojis  was  built  in  1801  and  is  historically  and  architecturally  the  most  distinctive. 
Restoration  plans  have  been  discussed  for  several  years.  It  has  not  been  used  as  a 
synagogue  since  before  World  War  II.  Afterwards,  it  was  used  as  a  school  gymnasium 
and  a  movie  theatre  before  being  abandoned  in  the  1980s.  Documentation  of  its 
appearance  as  a  synagogue  surv  ives. 

The  majority  of  the  remaining  wooden  synagogues  and  study  houses,  such  as  those  at 
Alanta.  Joniskelis,  Rozalimas,  and  Telsiai.  date  to  the  19th  century,  and  are  similar  in 
shape  and  construction  to  ordinary  houses  of  the  time.  They  barely  stand  out  among  the 
surrounding  buildings.  The  wooden  synagogue  (kloyz)  of  Plunge  was  built  in  the  1930s 
and  that  of  Kaltinenai  in  193  8. 

The  Center  for  Jewish  Art  at  Hebrew  University  of  Jerusalem  has  been  at  the  forefront  of 
efforts  to  document  the  buildings  and  plan  preservation.  Still,  because  the  cost  could  run 
into  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  for  each  building,  the  future  of  the  buildings 
remains  uncertain. 

In  2013,  Lithuanian  Jewish  Communities  Chair  Faina  Kukliansky  reported  that  the 
Jewish  community  had  to  initiate  the  urgent  dismantling  of  the  wooden  synagogue  in 
Seda,  which  was  partly  mined  and  in  dangerous  condition,  with  a  high  risk  of  collapse. 
Intact  parts  of  the  synagogue  building  were  placed  in  storage,  to  be  used  to  rebuild  the 
synagogue  at  a  future  date.

2.  Jewish  Cemeteries 


As  part  of  the  survey,  197  Jewish  cemeteries  were  identified  and  visited  in  46 
administrative  districts.  Only  two  of  the  cemeteries — in  Vilnius  and  Kaunas — are  still  in 
active  use  for  burials. 

Few  Jews  live  outside  of  Vilnius  and  Kaunas.  Where  there  are  no  Jews,  there  is  generally 
no  regular  cemetery  care.  Under  Jewish  law.  a  Jewish  cemetery  remains  a  cemetery  as 
long  as  human  remains  are  interred  there.  Human  remains  can  only  be  removed  for  the 
most  dire  reasons,  and  then  only  under  strict  rabbinic  supervision.  Thus,  even  cemeteries 
where  no  headstones  are  visible  remain  sacred  sites. 

Despite  efforts  to  clean  and  mark  cemeteries  by  the  Jewish  Communities  of  Lithuania, 
especially  during  the  1990s.  perhaps  90%  could  use  restoration,  including  substantial 
work  to  repair  or  expand  walls  and  fences,  re-erect  gravestones,  and  clean  and  repair 
stones  that  have  been  vandalized. 

In  2010.  Lithuanian  volunteers  created  the  MACEVA  project  as  a  non-profit,  non¬ 
governmental  institution  aimed  at  preserving  Jewish  cemeteries.  MACEVA  works  in 
cooperation  with  the  Lithuanian  Jewish  Community,  the  Lithuanian  Cultural  Heritage 
Department,  museums,  local  governments,  and  various  non-governmental  organizations. 

MACEVA  has  created  a  virtual  Jewish  cemetery  database,  and  has  digitized  gravestones; 
mostly  those  already  protected  in  the  programs  of  the  1990s.  Still,  so  far  only  about  10 
percent  of  Lithuanian  cemeteries  have  been  fully  documented,  and  this  documentation 
focuses  on  the  visible  surviving  stones  and  their  inscriptions. 

MACEVA  is  not  involved  in  investigating  and  mapping  the  original  boundaries  of 
cemeteries,  but  has  become  involved  in  cases  where  gravestones  have  been  unearthed 
during  construction  on  or  adjacent  to  known  cemetery  sites. 

Though  MACEVA  wishes  to  help  protect  and  preserve  the  physical  remains  of  Jewish 
cemeteries,  at  present  it  lacks  the  resources  to  do  so.  MACEVA  survives  on  donations, 
with  one  full-time  employee,  and  drawrs  in  an  annual  budget  of  approximately  30.000  Lt 
(€8,700).  According  to  Sergey  Kanovich.  “We  have  to  be  realistic  with  our  current 
means:  The  restoration  of  four  to  six  cemeteries  a  year  is  the  maximum  we  can  achieve 
provided  that  our  initiatives  are  welcomed  by  volunteers  on  the  ground." 

a.  Cemeteries  in  Vilnius  and  Kaunas 

There  are  three  Jewish  cemeteries  in  Vilnius.  Two  have  been  heavily  damaged  and  were 
built  upon  during  the  Soviet  period.  The  third  was  founded  in  the  1940s  and  remains  in 
use  for  burials. 

The  Old  Jewish  Cemetery  in  the  Zirmunai  area  near  the  Neris  River,  known  as  the 
Snipiskes  Cemetery,  is  located  in  proximity  to  the  Sarunas  Hotel  and  Sports  Palace.  The 


17 


cemetery  served  as  the  city’s  main  Jewish  cemetery  from  about  1487  to  1830.  In  the 
1950s,  the  gravestones  were  removed,  and  a  stadium  built  on  part  of  the  site.  A  marker 
erected  in  1 993  explains  that  the  location  is  a  cemetery  destroyed  during  the  Soviet 
period.  The  extent  of  the  original  cemetery  grounds  is  not  demarked. 

After  a  building  was  constructed  adjacent  to  the  cemetery  and  plans  were  revealed  for 
construction  in  the  cemetery,  the  Commission  pressed  the  Government  of  Lithuania  to 
prohibit  further  construction  in  Snipiskes  Cemetery.  On  October  2,  2008,  the  United 
States  Senate  passed  a  resolution  that  commended  the  Commission’s  work  and  said  in 
part:  “the  Government  of  Lithuania  has  allowed  construction  to  take  place  at  the  Jewish 
cemetery... that  desecration.. .is  an  affront  to  the  international  Jewish  community,  the 
people  of  the  United  States,  and  everyone  who  values  religious  freedom  and  ethnic 
diversity  around  the  world.”  The  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  had  passed  a  similar 
resolution  on  November  13,  2007.  In  August  2009,  the  Government  of  Lithuania  reached 
an  agreement  with  Jewish  organizations  on  the  boundaries  of  the  cemetery  and  agreed  to 
give  it  protected  status;  however,  part  of  the  agreement  was  that  buildings  already  on  the 
site  would  not  be  demolished. 

The  large  cemetery  on  Olandq,  known  as  the  Uzupis  Cemetery,  was  also  totally 
desecrated  in  the  1960s  during  the  Soviet  period.  All  of  the  headstones  were  moved,  a 
large  road  (Dalildziq)  was  cut  through  the  middle  of  the  hillside  site,  and  a  new  (non- 
Jewish)  funeral  hall  was  erected.  The  cemetery  was  established  in  1830  by  the  Vilnius 

V 

Jewish  Community  funeral  brotherhood  after  burials  ceased  at  the  Snipiskes  Cemetery. 
The  new  burial  place  included  a  large  mortuary  in  the  center  and  tree-lined  avenues. 

More  than  70,000  people  were  buried  at  the  site.  Burials  at  the  cemetery  ended  in  1948. 
The  headstones  were  removed  in  1 964,  and  many  were  used  as  building  material,  notably 
for  a  stairway  leading  up  to  the  city’s  trade  union  headquarters  on  Taurakalnis  (Tauro 
Hill).  A  relatively  small  number  of  human  remains  were  also  reburied  elsewhere.  After 
Lithuania's  independence  was  restored  in  1991,  the  Jewish  Communities  of  Lithuania 
and  the  Lithuanian  Culture  Fund  arranged  for  the  dismantling  of  the  Taurakalnis  steps 
and  other  structures  built  using  the  gravestones. 

In  2000,  members  of  the  Jewish  Museum  staff  began  clearing  part  of  the  hillside  closest 
to  the  main  road  and  revealed  the  stumps  of  several  dozen  gravestones.  Traces  of  the 
original  masonry  boundary  wall  were  found  further  back  in  the  cemetery.  In  2002,  the 
Jewish  Community  of  Vilnius  began  restoring  the  original  boundaries  and  clearing  the 
site  of  later  accretions.  A  memorial  built  of  broken  and  dislocated  gravestones,  many 
having  been  used  as  stairs,  was  constructed  in  2004  by  the  Commission  and  the  Vilnius 
City  Municipality  Administration. 

The  only  Jewish  cemetery  in  Vilnius  now  in  use  is  known  as  the  Suderve  Street,  or 

\/  V 

Seskine,  Cemetery,  for  the  Seskine  district  in  which  it  is  located.  Inaugurated  in  the  early 
1940s  next  to  a  Catholic  cemetery,  it  is  where  the  remains  of  the  Vilna  Gaon,  transferred 

V 

from  the  Snipiskes  cemetery,  rest  today.  (Some  Jews  are  also  buried  in  the  municipal 
Karveliskiq  cemetery,  in  a  suburb  of  Vilnius.) 


18 


There  are  five  cemeteries  in  different  districts  of  Kaunas — two  (one  without  gravestones) 
in  Vilijampole  (formerly  Slobodka),  and  the  others  in  the  Zaliakalnis,  Panemune,  and 
Aleksotas  districts.  The  Aleksotas  cemetery  is  the  only  active  Jewish  cemetery  in  Kaunas. 

Conditions  range  from  that  of  the  Aleksotas  cemetery,  which  is  maintained  and  where 
perhaps  75%  of  the  several  thousand  original  gravestones  are  still  in  situ ,  to  the  old 
cemetery  in  Vilijampole  (Slobodka),  which  has  had  all  of  its  gravestones  removed  or 
destroyed. 

The  Jewish  community  has  been  able  to  legally  maintain  the  largest  of  these,  the  Old 
Jewish  Cemetery  on  Radvilenp  plentas  in  the  Zaliakalnis  district,  only  since  1991.  It  was 
closed  after  World  War  II  and  from  then  until  1991,  local  residents  of  Kaunas  took 
hundreds  of  stones  for  building  material.  Many  brick  tombs  were  dismantled.  There  has 
been  considerable  vandalism.  Vegetation  is  also  a  problem.  Thousands  of  stones, 
however,  still  remain  in  an  area  that  covers  about  eight  hectares.  A  number  of  notable 
figures  were  buried  in  this  area.  According  to  MACEVA,  it  is  the  largest  Jewish  cemetery 
remaining  in  Lithuania. 

The  Aleksotas  cemetery  is  entered  through  a  gate  at  the  back  of  the  Naleksta  factory, 
from  an  area  that  formerly  housed  Soviet  army  units.  The  cemetery  is  adjacent  to  a 
barracks,  across  a  railroad  track,  but  is  physically  separated  from  the  buildings  by  a 
fence.  The  cemetery  has  almost  2,000  burial  plots.  It  is  a  State  Protected  Heritage  site. 

The  gravestones  and  markers  are  in  generally  good  condition.  There  has  been  some  minor 
vandalism,  but  relatively  little  defacement  or  damage  to  the  gravestones.  Names  are 
inscribed  in  both  Yiddish  and  Lithuanian.  The  newer  stones  often  have  photos  of  the 
deceased  or  the  likeness  carved  into  the  stone.  A  memorial  to  the  people  who  died  in  the 
Kaunas  (Kovno)  Ghetto  during  the  Holocaust  is  at  one  end.  Nearby  are  the  century-old 
graves  of  a  rabbi  and  his  son. 

According  to  Sergey  Kanovich,  MACEVA' s  founder,  “The  preservation  process  [of  these 
cemeteries]  is  moving  rather  slowly,  and  any  progress  that  is  made  is  only  due  to  the 
intervention  of  the  State  Heritage  Department.  Authorities  are  not  only  lacking  funds; 
they  mainly  lack  understanding  that  this  is  an  issue  of  common  heritage  and  history, 
something  which  they  should  be  proud  of." 

b.  Cemeteries  Elsewhere  in  Lithuania 

The  situation  that  is  common  at  many  cemeteries  throughout  the  country  can  be  seen  and 
understood  at  Kalvarija.  On  the  one  hand,  one  sees  several  dozen  remaining  upright 
gravestones  fenced-in  and  in  relatively  good  condition,  with  an  ohel  (a  structure  built 
over  the  grave  of  a  rabbi)  that  was  probably  erected  in  the  1920s.  The  low  fence  around 
this  area  is  for  marking,  not  security,  and  there  is  a  gate.  Inside  this  enclosure,  there  is  a 
stone  monument  identifying  the  site  as  an  old  Jewish  cemetery.  Other  sections  of  the 
cemetery,  however,  are  not  included  within  the  fenced  area  and  have  been  cleared  of 
gravestones  or  built  over. 


19 


The  surviving  gravestones  can  be  read.  Most  date  from  the  late  19th  century.  The  Hebrew 
inscriptions  include  names.  The  cemetery  probably  extended  to  the  nearby  brook  and  a 
nearby  German  Lutheran  cemetery,  also  abandoned.  Much  of  the  land  is  now  an  open 
field,  with  a  few  pieces  of  Jewish  gravestones  jutting  out  from  the  ground. 

At  the  time  of  the  survey,  several  inhabited  barracks-like  buildings  occupied  a  large  part 
of  the  cemetery.  A  large,  multi-hole  latrine  is  situated  near  the  buildings,  just  a  few  feet 
from  the  cemetery  fence  and  within  the  cemetery's  boundaries.  The  buildings  apparently 
were  erected  in  the  1 990s — after  the  fence  was  constructed. 

A  summary  of  the  conditions  of  the  197  Jewish  cemeteries  that  this  survey  identified  in 
modem  Lithuania  follows. 

c.  General  Site  Descriptions 

Most  Lithuanian  Jewish  cemeteries  date  from  the  19  and  20  centuries,  with  nine 
having  stones  with  legible  dates  from  the  18th  century. 

The  majority  (128,  or  65%)  are  located  in  or  near  towns  of  under  5,000  residents,  with  46 
(23%)  of  these  located  in  the  vicinity  of  towns  with  fewer  than  1,000.  Roughly  half  (96) 
are  within  towns,  16%  (32)  are  in  suburban  areas,  and  the  remaining  third  (63)  are  in 
mral  areas. 

Eighty  percent  (158)  are  in  or  near  towns  with  no  Jewish  population,  and  only  Vilnius 
and  Kaunas,  where  nine  cemeteries  are  located,  have  more  than  100  Jewish  residents. 
Most  of  the  cemeteries  (176,  or  89%)  are  isolated  from  other  cemeteries.  Only  the  Jewish 
section  of  the  Karveliskip  Cemetery  in  Vilnius  is  part  of  a  municipal  cemetery.  Thirteen 
Jewish  cemeteries  are  near  other  cemeteries. 

When  the  field  survey  for  this  report  was  conducted,  the  majority  of  Jewish  cemeteries 
were  marked,  often  in  more  than  one  language.  Eighty  percent  were  marked  in 
Lithuanian  and  seventy-six  percent  were  marked  in  Yiddish.  Eleven  were  marked  with 
signs  in  Hebrew  and  three  were  marked  by  Jewish  symbols.  Thirty -three  (17%)  were  not 
marked. 

Four  cemeteries  (Smeliu  St.  Cemetery  in  Alytus,  a  cemetery  in  the  former  market  in 
Luokiai,  a  destroyed  cemetery  in  Laukava.  and  the  Jaunimas  Hill  Cemetery  in  Palanga) 
have  had  all  of  their  gravestones  removed  and  are  unmarked.  All  four  are  located  in 
towns  with  another  Jewish  cemetery,  so  the  stones  may  have  been  moved  to  the  newer 
Jewish  cemetery  in  town. 

d.  Appearance  and  Condition 

A  significant  number  of  cemeteries  have  had  tombstones  removed  or  relocated  within  the 
country.  Twenty-five  (13%)  have  had  all  of  their  tombstones  removed.  Thirty-eight 
(19%)  have  fewer  than  40  tombstones;  twelve  of  these  have  fewer  than  20.  Nine  have 


20 


more  than  500  gravestones.  The  Seskine  cemetery  in  Vilnius  and  the  Zalniakalnis 
cemetery  in  Kaunas  have  the  most,  each  with  5,000  or  more. 

At  the  time  of  the  survey,  all  but  six  of  the  cemeteries  had  stones  that  were  toppled  or 
broken.  Fifty-three  cemeteries  had  fewer  than  25%  of  their  stones  damaged,  55  had  25- 
50%  damaged,  and  49  had  50-75%  damaged.  Six  cemeteries  (the  Kauno  Street  Cemetery 
in  Zarasai.  the  Jewish  sections  in  the  Saltoniskes  and  Karveliskip  municipal  cemeteries  in 
Vilnius,  the  cemeteries  in  Vaskai  and  Ignalina,  and  the  Zalniakalnis  cemetery  in  Kaunas) 
have  more  than  75%  of  their  stones  toppled  or  broken. 

In  most  cases  where  stones  have  been  removed,  the  location  of  the  stones  is  not  known. 

In  five  cases,  however,  it  is.  Stones  from  the  Snipiskes,  Uzupis,  Saltoniskes,  and 
Karveliskiq  cemeteries  in  Vilnius  have  been  moved  to  other  Jewish  cemeteries,  mostly  to 

V  y 

the  Seskine  cemetery.  Stones  removed  from  the  Jewish  cemetery  in  Svencionys  were 
used  as  building  material  for  a  stable. 

Vegetation  is  a  problem  for  most  cemeteries.  At  the  time  of  this  survey,  overgrown 
vegetation  was  damaging  gravestones  in  eight  cemeteries.  These  are  Dauglaukis, 
Grinkiskis,  Baisogala,  Nemaksiai,  Siaulenai,  Seduva,  Zeimelis,  and  Liubavas. 

Drainage  is  a  problem  for  a  few  cemeteries.  The  Daugai  cemetery  and  the  Utena 
cemetery  in  Siliniai  Forest  have  seasonal  problems  with  drainage.  Four  cemeteries  have 
constant  drainage  problems.  Of  these,  three — Zeimelis,  Vandziogala,  and  Balsiaire — are 
surrounded  by  swampland,  which  prevents  access  and,  in  the  case  of  the  Zeimelis, 
contributes  to  a  situation  of  severe  degradation.  In  addition  to  being  threatened  by 
vegetation,  the  fourth  cemetery,  Baisogala,  was  partially  underwater  due  to  a  dam.  and 
stones  were  rapidly  disappearing. 

e.  Gravestones  and  Memorial  Markers 

The  majority  of  the  stones  remaining  in  these  cemeteries  are  granite,  but  there  are  also 
gravestones  made  of  slate,  and  occasionally  of  marble,  limestone,  sandstone,  or  iron.  It  is 
very  likely  that,  in  most  cemeteries,  many  gravestones  made  of  more  valuable  stone, 
especially  marble,  have  been  stolen.  Most  of  the  cemeteries  (142,  or  72%)  have 

V 

tombstones  with  traces  of  painting  on  their  surfaces.  Five  (Vilkija,  Seskine  and 
Karveliskip  in  Vilnius,  and  Zaliakalnis  and  Aleksotas  in  Kaunas)  have  stones  with 
portraits. 

At  the  time  of  the  survey,  1 3  cemeteries  contained  monuments  in  memory  of  Holocaust 
victims.  These  were  Aleksotas,  Zaliakalnis  and  the  new  and  old  Vilijampole  cemeteries 
in  Kaunas,  Seskine  in  Vilnius,  Kretinga,  Klaipeda.  Daugai,  Naumiestis,  Upyna, 
Butrimonys,  Kudirkos  Naumiestis,  and  Kretinag.  Four  of  these  also  contain  mass  graves. 
The  Medziotoju  Street  cemetery  in  Alytus  includes  a  marked  mass  grave.  The  Seskine 
cemetery  in  Vilnius  has  monuments  to  Jewish  soldiers  and  pogrom  victims.  There  are 
approximately  200  known  Holocaust  mass  graves  in  Lithuania,  all  of  them  now  marked. 


21 


f.  Structures 


The  Seskine  (Vilnius)  and  Aleksotas  (Kaunas)  cemeteries  have  pre-burial  houses.  The 
pre-burial  house  in  Seskine  contains  a  tahara  (table).  The  Aleksotas  cemetery  also 
contains  an  ohel,  as  do  the  cemeteries  in  Kalvarija  and  Klaipeda.  There  is  a  well  in  the 
Jubarkas  cemetery. 

g.  Current  Use 

The  vast  majority  of  the  cemeteries  (185,  or  94%)  are  controlled  by  municipal 
governments.  At  the  time  of  the  survey,  the  national  Jewish  organization  owned  seven 
outside  of  Vilnius  and  Kaunas — Paberze,  Nemecine,  Maisogala,  Vievis,  Trakai, 

Rudiskes,  and  Aukstadvaris.  Both  cemeteries  in  Utena  (one  on  the  west  side  and  one  in 
the  Siliniai  Forest)  were  controlled  by  individuals  and  were  in  commercial  zones. 

Most  cemeteries  (171,  or  87%)  are  neither  used  for  new  burials  nor  for  other  purposes.  At 
the  time  of  the  survey,  nine  were  recreation  areas  and  five  were  occupied  by  residential 
buildings.  Five  cemeteries  (the  two  Utena  cemeteries,  Smeliu  St.  in  Alytus,  Uzupis  in 
Vilnius,  and  the  old  Vilijampole  cemetery  in  Kaunas)  were  used  for  commercial  or 
industrial  purposes.  For  instance,  the  Smeliu  Street  cemetery  in  Alytus  was  a  storage 
area.  The  Utena  cemetery  in  the  Siliniai  Forest  was  a  garbage  dump,  as  was  the  Liskava 
cemetery.  The  cemeteries  in  Seduva  and  Salantai  were  pastures. 

Residential  zones  surround  two-thirds  of  the  cemeteries  (131),  while  just  over  a  quarter 
(53,  or  27%)  are  surrounded  by  farmland.  Fifteen  are  near  commercial  or  industrial  areas 
and  three  are  near  parks.  Eighteen  are  surrounded  by  areas  used  for  other  purposes,  for 
instance,  the  cemetery  in  Vievis  is  adjacent  to  a  highway.  A  road  crosses  the  cemetery  in 
Dukstas.  All  of  the  gravestones  there  have  been  removed. 

Although  pre-World  War  II  size  information  was  not  available  for  many  of  the 
cemeteries,  records  do  show  that  boundaries  of  at  least  31  are  smaller  today  than  before. 

It  is  often  difficult  to  ascertain  original  boundaries.  Twelve  of  the  31  cemeteries  (39%) 
were  reduced  in  size  due  to  roads,  and  another  twelve  were  reduced  because  of 
commercial  development.  Six  (19%)  were  reduced  because  of  agriculture,  and  five  (16%) 
because  of  housing  (two  of  these  also  for  schools).  Two  cemeteries  were  partly 
incorporated  into  parks. 

Survey  responses  suggest  that  very  few  (four,  or  2%)  of  the  cemeteries  are  visited  often. 
These  are  two  cemeteries  in  Zarasai,  Seskine  (Vilnius),  and  the  Kaunas  Aleksota 
cemetery.  At  the  time  of  the  survey,  26  cemeteries  were  virtually  unknown  and  never 
visited.  In  fact,  only  the  survey  responses  for  the  Aleksotas  cemetery  in  Kaunas  and  the 
Seskine  cemetery  in  Vilnius  (both  cities  with  Jewish  populations)  indicated  a  local 
interest.  At  the  time  of  the  survey,  very  few  tours  visited  the  cemeteries.  Those  that  did 
mostly  visited  the  ones  in  Vilnius  and  Kaunas,  although  the  Vilna  Gaon  Jewish  Museum 


22 


and  several  private  tourist  agencies,  guides  and  organizations,  as  well  as  genealogy 
groups,  now  arrange  tours  to  other  localities. 

h.  Cemetery  Care  and  Restoration 

By  the  time  of  the  surv  ey,  the  vast  majority  of  cemeteries  (154,  or  78%)  had  been 
vandalized  since  World  War  II,  and  at  least  26  since  1990.  At  least  26  cemeteries  had 
been  vandalized  after  being  restored.  At  least  30  cemeteries,  however,  had  been  free  of 
vandalism  during  the  10  years  prior  to  the  surv  ey. 

Most  cemeteries  had  received  some  kind  of  maintenance,  even  if  only  the  clearing  of 
vegetation — 150  (76%)  have  been  at  least  occasionally  cleared.  Fallen  gravestones  had 
been  re-erected  in  66  cemeteries  (34%).  Stones  were  cleaned  in  66  as  well.  Thirty-six  had 
some  repair  to  their  walls.  Thirteen  had  gravestones  repaired. 

Most  of  the  restoration  before  the  survey  was  carried  out  took  place  in  the  early  1990s.  In 
most  cases,  work  was  done  by  municipal  authorities.  Occasionally,  they  were  assisted  by 
Lithuanian  Jewish  groups.  Such  groups  had  worked  in  12  cemeteries  by  2004.  The 
Seskine  cemetery  in  Vilnius  has  also  received  assistance  from  regional  or  national 
authorities  and  from  Jewish  individuals,  from  abroad  as  well  as  from  Lithuania.  Work  in 
Moletai  and  the  two  Utena  cemeteries  was  carried  out  by  individuals  or  groups  of  non- 
Jewish  origin.  The  old  Vilijampole  cemetery  in  Kaunas  has  been  cared  for  by  Lithuanian 
and  non-Lithuanian  Jewish  groups. 

Despite  these  efforts,  few  of  the  cemeteries  at  the  time  of  the  survey  were  receiving 
regular  maintenance.  Data  indicated  that  only  1 1  received  regular  care,  and  only  three  of 
these  had  regular  caretakers.  Forty  cemeteries  (20%)  received  no  care.  The  majority  (132, 
or  67%)  received  only  occasional  clearing. 

At  the  time  of  the  survey,  the  three  cemeteries  with  regular  caretakers  were  Radviliskes, 
Seskine  (Vilnius),  and  Aleksotas  (Kaunas).  The  caretakers  were  paid  at  least  in  part  by 
the  government.  In  the  case  of  Seskine.  part  of  the  payment  was  provided  by  a  Jewish 
congregation. 

i.  Additional  Information 

At  least  84  cemeteries  appeared  to  be  in  serious  need  of  care.  Some  of  these  had  been 
extremely  neglected  when  inspected  during  the  survey.  Despite  efforts  by  the  Jewish 
community,  the  MACEVA  volunteer  group  and  others,  the  situation  is  believed  to  remain 
about  the  same  today. 

Manv  cemeteries  are  very  difficult  to  reach  due  to  seasonal  or  constant  vegetation. 

V 

Though  listed  as  a  national  cultural  monument,  the  cemetery  in  Siaulenai,  in  the 
Radviliskis  district,  was  so  overgrown  that  it  was  impossible  to  determine  the  number  of 
stones  when  visited  for  the  survey.  (Today,  the  cultural  monument  listing  says  it  is 


23 


fenced,  with  a  gate  and  marking  sign,  and  has  248  gravestones).  The  cemetery  in 
Liubavas,  in  the  Marijampole  district,  was  vanishing  from  sight  due  to  similar  conditions. 

Stones  were  also  rapidly  disappearing  in  the  cemetery  in  Baisogala,  which  was  partially 
underwater  due  to  a  dam.  In  Dauglaukis,  a  cemetery  in  a  forest  was  only  recently 
rediscovered.  Its  borders  had  still  not  been  identified.  It  is  believed  to  have  been  used  for 
burials  until  before  World  War  I,  when  Jews  left  the  area.  (Maceva  has  since  documented 
four  gravestones,  only  one  of  them  legible  enough  to  read  the  inscription.  It  was  dated 
1783.) 

While  the  clearing  of  vegetation  is  perhaps  the  most  pressing  concern  for  many  of  these 
cemeteries,  more  and  better  signs  and  fences  would  also  help  to  identify  and  protect  some 
of  the  most  threatened. 

Many  cemeteries  have  been  fenced  since  the  1 990s.  Unfortunately,  this  work  was  done 
mainly  to  protect  existing  gravestones  rather  than  to  demark  historic  boundaries.  Many 
cemeteries  appear  to  be  relatively  well  kept,  but  closer  examination  reveals  that  only  a 
small  portion  of  the  original  cemetery  is  within  the  enclosed  area.  Thus,  many  burials — 
often  many  hundreds — are  unprotected. 

3.  Holocaust  Sites  in  Lithuania 

There  are  a  great  many  Holocaust  sites  in  Lithuania.  These  include  deportation  centers, 
ghettos,  concentration  camps,  killing  sites,  and  death  camps.  Many  are  not  well  known. 
Several,  however,  have  been  recognized  and  protected  as  national  memorial  sites. 
Foremost  among  these  are  Paneriai,  where  tens  of  thousands  of  Jews  from  Vilnius  were 
killed,  and  the  Ninth  Fort,  which  was  the  death  site  of  people  who  lived  in  Kaunas. 

a.  Paneriai 

Paneriai  (the  Ponary  Forest,  ten  kilometers  from  Vilnius  ‘as  the  crow  flies’  but  further  by 
road)  was  the  site  of  the  massacre  of  approximately  100,000  people,  of  whom  70,000  are 
believed  to  have  been  people  of  the  Jewish  faith.  The  site  is  now  a  memorial  park.  Since 
1991,  a  new  series  of  monuments  has  been  erected,  replacing  wording  that  previously 
only  noted  the  murder  of  “Soviet  citizens.”  There  is  a  small  museum  run  by  the  Vilna 
Gaon  State  Jewish  Museum.  Paths  meander  through  woods  leading  to  sites  of  pits  to 
which  victims  were  herded  and  executed.  The  pits  were  originally  intended  for  oil 
cisterns.  After  the  murders,  Jews  were  brought  to  the  sites  to  exhume  and  burn  the  bodies. 
Eighty  Jews  managed  a  dramatic  escape  during  this  process.  Today,  piles  of  ashes  from 
the  burned  bodies  are  marked  with  stones.  An  annual  ceremony  is  held  every  September 
23rd. 

b.  Ninth  Fort 

Built  as  a  Tsarist  defensive  bastion,  the  fort  was  used  as  a  Lithuanian  prison  from  1924  to 
1940.  In  1940  and  1941,  it  was  under  KGB  supervision,  and  it  was  from  here  that 


24 


prisoners  were  taken  to  Siberia.  Then,  from  1941  to  1944.  the  Germans  transformed  the 
site  into  a  death  camp,  where  at  least  20,000  Jews  from  the  Kaunas  Ghetto  were  killed. 

The  fort  was  opened  as  a  museum  in  1959.  In  1984.  a  new  building  was  erected  as  a 
military  museum  and  an  imposing  memorial  was  built.  The  primary'  site,  however,  is  the 
fort,  which  is  vast  and  eerie.  It  contains  several  small  exhibits.  These  include  exhibits  on 
the  dramatic  escape  of  64  prisoners  in  1944,  the  rescue  efforts  of  Chiune  and  Yukiki 
Sugihara.  and  the  rescue  of  Jews  by  Lithuanians.  There  is  also  an  exhibit  on  the  Kaunas 
Ghetto. 

Just  beyond  the  fort  are  the  killing  fields,  with  an  enormous  monument.  It  is  adjacent  to  a 
field  where  the  ashes  of  the  murdered  were  spread.  The  original  1984  monument  made  no 
reference  to  Jews.  Now.  there  is  a  new  stone  monument  with  texts  in  Lithuanian.  Hebrew, 
English,  and  Russian  that  make  the  Holocaust  motivation  clear. 

c.  Other  Holocaust  Sites 

There  are  hundreds  of  other  Holocaust  sites  in  Lithuania,  including  more  than  200  sites  of 
mass  execution  and/or  mass  graves.  Most  often,  killing  sites  and  mass  burial  sites  are  in 
the  same  place.  Often  victims  were  made  to  dig  their  own  graves.  In  some  cases,  people 
who  w'ere  Jewish  were  executed  in  a  cemetery  and  then  buried  there.  Sometimes,  the 
bodies  of  Holocaust  victims  were  moved  to  the  cemetery'. 

Beginning  in  1988,  with  the  Lithuanian  National  Revival,  and  continuing  through  the  first 
years  of  independence,  people  of  the  Jewish  faith  began  tending  the  mass-murder  sites.  In 
1990,  the  Supreme  Council  of  Lithuania  passed  a  resolution  entitled,  “Tending  to  the 
graves  and  cemeteries  of  the  victims  of  the  Jewish  genocide  and  preserving  the  Jewish 
heritage."  This  led  to  active  efforts  of  Lithuanian  Jewish  organizations  to  clean  up  death 
sites  and  mass  burial  sites,  and  to  erect  new  monuments. 

These  monuments,  which  wrere  erected  throughout  the  1990s,  carry'  inscriptions  in 
Lithuanian  and  Yiddish,  and  provide  some  information  about  the  Holocaust.  In  1998, 
Yosif  Levinson,  w  ho  was  chairman  of  the  Commission  for  Maintenance  of  Jewish 
Cemeteries  and  Sites  of  Massacre,  and  was  actively  involved  in  the  promulgation  of  the 
Lithuanian  Supreme  Council  resolution,  published  a  book  that  includes  information  on  all 
of  the  sites.  Mr.  Levinson  served  as  an  advisor  to  the  Commission's  surv  ey.  Milda 
Jakulyte- Vasil  published  an  updated  “Lithuanian  Holocaust  Atlas"  in  201 1  that  contains 
information  on  227  mass  grave  sites  of  Jews  killed  in  the  Shoah. 

This  report  lists  all  mass  burial  sites  known  as  of  2004,  organized  by  administrative 
district.  (Table  VI)
