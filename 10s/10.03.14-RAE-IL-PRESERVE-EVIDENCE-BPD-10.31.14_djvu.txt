RE:  Preservation  and  Information/Records  Retention  Letter  regarding  the 
October  3,  2014  shooting  of  a  family  pet,  Raeleigh,  belonging  to  Gina  Marie 
Stone 

Dear  Custodian  of  Records  /  Responsible  Agent: 

This  notice  is  in  reference  to  Incident  No.  1411306  that  occurred  on  October  3,  2014  at  5:10  pm  at  1148 
Taft  Avenue,  Berkeley,  IL  60163  when  my  dog,  Raeleigh,  was  shot  by  Officer  J.  Parker  (112/615)  from  the 
Berkeley  Police  Department  ("Incident"). 

My  name  is  Gina  Marie  Stone  and  this  letter  serves  as  a  formal  request  for  the  preservation  of  any  and 
all  evidence,  information,  records,  documents,  photos,  audio  or  video  recordings,  paper  or  electronic 
data,  and/or  other  tangible  items  pertaining  or  relevant  to  or  property  discoverable  (the  "Preserved 
Information")  to  Incident  No.  1411306  that  occurred  on  October  3,  2014  at  5:10  pm  at  1148  Taft 
Avenue,  Berkeley,  IL  60163  when  my  dog,  Raeleigh,  was  shot  by  Officer  J.  Parker  (112/615)  from  the 
Berkeley  Police  Department.  You  are  hereby  given  further  notice  that  Preserved  Information  is  not  to 


be  destroyed,  concealed  or  altered  in  any  manner  whatsoever,  and  that  any  ongoing  processing  of 
document  destruction  involving  such  Preserved  Information  must  cease  immediately. 

At  this  preliminary  stage,  I  seek  to  obtain  information  which  may  provide  additional  insight  regarding 
(without  limitation)  to  how  the  Incident  occurred,  policies  and  procedures  involved  in  the  Incident,  why 
Officer  J.  Parker  (112/615)  acted  so  cruelly  towards  an  otherwise  non-threatening  family  pet,  and  why 
he  exercised  such  poor  and  reckless  judgment  with  his  sidearm,  and  who  may  be  held  responsible  for 
my  damages.  Please  understand  that,  by  virtue  of  your  receipt  of  this  letter,  you  have  been  identified  as 
a  potential  defendant  in  legal  action  which  may  be  imminent.  As  of  this  writing,  no  lawsuit  has  been 
filed.  Hopefully,  with  open  and  honest  dialogue  and  exchange  of  information,  legal  action  can  be 
avoided. 

Please  be  advised  that  by  this  letter,  you  are  hereby  given  notice  and  under  a  legal  duty  to  maintain, 
preserve,  retain,  protect,  and  not  to  destroy,  conceal  or  alter  any  paper  or  electronic  files  and  other  data 
generated  by  and/or  stored  on  your  computers,  recording  devices  and  storage  media  (e.g.,  hard  disks, 
floppy  disks,  tapes,  backup  tapes,  hard  drives),  or  any  other  electronic  data,  such  as  email  or  voice  mail 
that  relate  to  the  Incident.  As  you  know,  your  failure  to  comply  with  the  preservation  and  retention  of 
the  evidence  outlined  can  result  in  severe  sanctions  (and  liability  in  tort)  being  imposed  by  a  court  of  law 
for  spoliation  of  evidence  or  potential  evidence. 

Preservation  of  information,  documents,  and  evidence  means  taking  reasonable  steps  to: 

(a)  ensure  that  relevant  documents  (including  electronically  stored  information)  are  not  destroyed,  lost  or 
relinquished  to  others,  either  intentionally,  or  inadvertently  such  as  through  the  implementation  of  an 
ordinary  course  document  retention/destruction  policy; 

(b)  ensure  that  relevant  documents  are  not  modified  -  an  issue  that  arises  particularly  in  the  case  of 
electronically  stored  information  (which  may  be  modified  by  the  simple  act  of  accessing  the 
information),  and  in  the  case  of  documents  used  on  an  ongoing  basis  in  the  operation  of  the  business; 
and 

(c)  ensure  that  relevant  documents  remain  accessible  -  again,  an  issue  that  arises  particularly  in  the  case  of 
electronically  stored  information,  which  may  require  particular  forms  of  software  or  hardware  to  remain 
readable. 

I  anticipate  requesting  from  you  a  number  of  documents  and  things,  including  files  stored  on  your 
recording  devices,  email  servers,  computers  and  computer  storage  media  that  relate  to  the  Incident.  In 
order  to  avoid  spoliation,  you  will  need  to  provide  the  data  requested  on  the  original  media.  Do  not 
reuse  any  media  to  provide  this  data. 

Although  I  may  bring  a  motion  for  an  order  preserving  documents  and  things  from  destruction  or 
alteration,  your  obligation  to  preserve  documents  and  things  for  discovery  and/or  public  records  law 
requests  in  this  case  arises  in  law  and  equity  independently  from  any  order  on  such  motion. 

Electronic  documents  and  the  storage  media  on  which  they  reside  contain  relevant,  discoverable 
information  beyond  that  which  may  be  found  in  printed  documents.  Therefore,  even  where  a  paper  copy 
exists,  I  will  seek  all  documents  in  their  electronic  form  along  with  information  about  those  documents 
contained  on  the  media.  I  also  will  seek  paper  printouts  of  only  those  documents  that  contain  unique 


information  after  they  were  printed  out  (such  as  paper  documents  containing  handwriting,  signatures, 
marginalia,  drawings,  annotations,  highlighting  and  redactions)  along  with  any  paper  documents  for  which 
no  corresponding  electronic  files  exist. 

My  discovery  and/or  public  records  law  requests  will  ask  for  certain  data  on  the  hard  disks,  floppy  disks 
and  backup  media  used  in  your  computers,  some  of  which  data  are  not  readily  available  to  an  ordinary 
computer  user,  such  as  "deleted"  files  and  "file  fragments."  As  you  may  know,  although  a  user  may 
"erase"  or  "delete"  a  file  all  that  is  really  erased  is  a  reference  to  that  file  in  a  table  on  the  hard  disk;  unless 
overwritten  with  new  data,  a  "deleted"  file  can  be  as  intact  on  the  disk  as  any  "active"  file  you  would  see 
in  a  directory  listing. 

Courts  have  made  it  clear  that  all  information  available  on  electronic  storage  media  is  discoverable, 
whether  readily  readable  ("active")  or  "deleted"  but  recoverable.  Accordingly,  in  the  event  litigation 
ensues,  electronic  data  and  storage  media  that  may  be  subject  to  my  discovery  and/or  public  records  law 
requests  and  that  you  are  obligated  to  maintain  and  not  alter  or  destroy,  include  but  are  not  limited  to 
the  following: 

All  digital  or  analog  electronic  files,  including  "deleted"  files  and  file  fragments,  stored  in  machine- 
readable  format  on  magnetic,  optical  or  other  storage  media,  including  without  limitation  the  hard  drives 
or  floppy  disks  used  in  connection  with  your  computers  and  their  backup  media  (e.g.,  other  hard  drives, 
backup  tapes,  floppies,  Jaz  cartridges,  CD-ROMs)  or  otherwise,  whether  such  files  have  been  reduced  to 
paper  printouts  or  not.  More  specifically,  you  are  to  preserve  all  of  your  e-mails  related  to  the  Incident, 
both  sent  and  received,  whether  internally  or  externally;  all  word-processed  files  related  to  the  Incident, 
including  drafts  and  revisions;  all  spreadsheets,  including  drafts  and  revisions;  all  databases  related  to  the 
Incident;  all  CAD  (computer-aided  design)  files  related  to  the  Incident,  including  drafts  and  revisions;  all 
presentation  data  or  slide  shows  related  to  the  Incident  and  produced  by  presentation  software  (such  as 
Microsoft  PowerPoint);  all  graphs,  charts  and  other  data  related  to  the  Incident  and  produced  by  project 
management  software  (such  as  Microsoft  Project);  all  data  related  to  the  Incident  generated  by 
calendaring,  task  management  and  personal  information  management  (PIM)  software  (such  as  Microsoft 
Outlook  or  Lotus  Notes);  all  data  related  to  the  Incident  created  with  the  use  of  personal  data  assistants 
(PDAs),  such  as  Palm  Pilot,  HP  Jornada,  Cassiopeia  or  other  Windows  CE-based  or  Pocket  PC  devices;  all 
data  related  to  the  Incident  created  with  the  use  of  document  management  software;  all  data  related  to 
the  Incident  created  with  the  use  of  paper  and  electronic  mail  logging  and  routing  software;  all  Internet 
and  Web-browser-generated  history  files,  caches  and  "cookies"  files  related  to  the  Incident  and  generated 
at  the  workstation  of  each  employee  and/or  agent  in  your  employ  and  on  any  and  all  backup  storage 
media;  and  any  and  all  other  files  or  recordings  related  to  the  Incident  and  generated  by  users  through 
the  use  of  recording  devices,  computers  and/or  telecommunications,  including  but  not  limited  to  audio 
and  video  recordings  and  voice  mail. 

You  are  also  not  to  pack,  compress,  purge  or  otherwise  dispose  of  files  and  parts  of  files  related  to  the 
Incident  unless  a  true  and  correct  copy  of  such  files  is  made. 

You  are  also  to  preserve  and  not  destroy  all  passwords,  decryption  procedures  (including,  if  necessary, 
the  software  to  decrypt  the  files);  network  access  codes,  ID  names,  manuals,  tutorials,  written 
instructions,  decompression  or  reconstruction  software,  and  any  and  all  other  information  and  things 
necessary  to  access,  view  and  (if  necessary)  reconstruct  the  electronic  data  I  will  request  through 
discovery  and/or  public  records  law  that  relates  to  the  Incident. 


You  are  hereby  given  further  notice  that  any  and  all  Preserved  Information  and/  or  potential  evidence 
related  to  Incident  No.  1411306  is  to  be  preserved  and  not  to  be  destroyed,  concealed  or  altered  in  any 
manner  whatsoever,  and  that  any  ongoing  processing  of  document  destruction  involving  such  Preserved 
Information  must  cease  immediately.  In  particular,  please  identify  and  save  all  information  and  records, 
including  but  not  limited  to  incident  reports,  use  of  force  reports,  discharge  of  firearms  reports,  forensic 
reports  and/or  analysis,  referrals  to  Internal  Affairs,  referrals  to  Animal  Control  agencies,  statistical
