Exports  Rise  21  Percent  in  1995 

Bulk  Exports  Account  for  Most  of  Gain 


--September  Comparisons— 


September  trade  statistics  released  on 
November  22  by  the  Commerce 
Department  placed  the  value  of  U.S. 
agricultural,  fish  and  forest  product 
exports  at  $5.6  billion,  up  26  percent 
from  September  1994.  Agricultural 
exports  alone  totaled  $4.7  billion,  up 
33  percent  from  the  same  month  last 
year.  U.S.  exports  of  fish  and  seafood 
products  totaled  $369  million  in 
September,  up  16  percent  from  the 
same  month  last  year.  Forest  products 
were  down  9  percent  at  $553  million. 

September's  performance  brings  fiscal 
1995  to  a  close  with  new  record  highs 
established  across  a  broad  range  of 
product  and  country  markets.  U.S. 
agricultural,  fish  and  forest  product 
exports  totaled  $64.6  billion  in  fiscal 
1995,  up  21  percent  from  the  previous 
year  and  the  highest  export  figure  ever. 
Agricultural  exports  alone  reached 
$54.1  billion,  a  new  record  which 
exceeds  last  year's  sales  by  a 
remarkable  25  percent.  Nearly  two- 
tlurds  of  the  growth  in  agricultural 
exports  was  due  to  rising  bulk  exports. 
Fiscal  1 995  exports  of  fish  and  seafood 
products  rose  9  percent  to  $3.2  billion. 
U.S.  forest  product  exports  also  rose, 
up  5  percent  from  the  previous  year  to 
$7.3  billion. 


September’s  performance  brings  hulk 
commodity  exports  to  $24.5  billion  in 
fiscal  1995,  up  a  remarkable  $6.5 
billion  or  36  percent  from  the  previous 
year.  While  all  commodity  groups 
registered  increases,  coarse  grains, 
cotton,  soybeans  and  wheat  accounted 
for  94  percent  of  the  gain.  Cotton  was 
the  only  bulk  commodity  to  end  the 
year  with  record  sales. 

Septembers  performance  brings 
intermediate  exports  to  $1 1.2  billion  in 
fiscal  1995.  up  19  percent  from  the 
previous  year  and  a  new  record  high. 
Nine  of  the  10  product  groups  rose 
with  soybean  oil,  other  vegetable  oils, 
hides  and  skins  and  animal  fats 
recording  the  largest  gains.  New 
export  records  were  set  for  soybean  oil. 
other  vegetable  oils,  feeds  and  fodders, 
animal  fats,  and  planting  seeds. 

September’s  performance  brings 
consumer  food  exports  to  $1X.5  billion 
in  fiscal  1995,  up  15  percent  from  the 
previous  year  and  a  new  record  high. 
Twelve  of  the  15  product  groups  rose 
with  chilled  and  frozen  red  meats  and 
poultry  meats  leading  the  pack.  Snack 
foods,  breakfast  cereals  and  tree  nuts 
fell  slightly.  New  export  records  were 


o 


set  in  nine  product  gr-bups  Including  all 
meat,  fruit,  and  vegetable  groups. 

September's  performance  brings  fish 
and  seafood  exports  to  $3.2  billion  in 
fiscal  1995,  up  9  percent  from  the 
previous  year  but  $173  million  shy  of 
the  record  set  in  1992.  Nevertheless, 
new  export  records  were  set  for  canned 
salmon,  surimi,  and  roe  and  urchin. 

Despite  recent  month-to-month  sales 
declines./orext  product  exports  reached 
$7.3  billion  in  fiscal  1995.  This 

represents  a  5-percent  increase  over 
1994,  but  falls  $19  million  short  of  the 
record  set  in  1993.  Panel  products 
ended  the  year  at  a  record  $992 
million. 

The  World  Outlook  Board  released  its 
revised  fiscal  1996  trade  forecasts  on 
November  3(1.  U.S.  agricultural 
exports  are  expected  to  reach  S5X 
billion,  up  $3.5  billion  from  the 
previous  forecast  in  August.  Tight 

global  supplies  are  expected  to  raise 
prices  for  wheat,  coarse  grains  and 
soybeans,  while  livestock  products  will 
achieve  strong  gains,  hugely  due  to 
rising  red  meat  shipments.  With 

imports  forecast  at  $29  billion,  the 
agricultural  trade  surplus  is  forecast  to 
reach  a  record  $29  billion.

Consumer  Food  Highlights 


U.S.  consumer  food  exports  totaled  $13. 6  billion  during  the  first 
three-quarters  of  calendar  1995,  up  12.8  percent  over  the  same 
period  a  year  earlier.  Thirteen  of  the  16  consumer  food  categories 
recorded  increased  export  levels.  Exports  to  Japan,  the  No.  I  market 
for  consumer  foods,  reached  $3.9  billion,  up  24  percent  over  1994. 
Exports  to  Japan  this  year  will  surpass  the  record  $4.3  billion  set  in 
1994.  Consumer  food  exports  to  Canada,  the  No.  2  export  market 
are  up  8  percent  at  $3.16  billion.  Of  the  top  JO  markets  for  consumer 
foods,  only  Mexico  is  experiencing  a  decline  in  sales  from  a  year 
earlier.  Exports  to  Mexico  are  down  due  to  a  decline  in  consumer 
purchasing  power  resulting  from  the  devaluation  of  the  Mexican  peso. 


U.S.  exports  ot  fresh,  frozen,  and 
chilled  red  meat  during  the  first  nine 
months  of  1995  totaled  $3.1  billion,  up 
26  percent  over  the  nine  months  in 
1994.  The  value  of  export  shipments 
from  this  red  meat  category  reached  a 
record  $3.4  billion  in  1994  and  now 
account  for  only  slightly  less  than  one- 
quarter  of  the  total  value  of  all 
consumer-ready  food  exports.  Exports 
to  Jap;ui,  the  leading  export  destination, 
are  up  37  percent  at  $2.0  billion. 
Shipments  to  Korea,  Hong  Kong, 
Taiwan,  the  Russian  Federation, 
Indonesia,  and  Colombia  have  all  set 
new  annual  records  during  the  first  nine 
months  of  this  year.  The  recently 
negotiated  settlement  with  Korea  over 
the  shelf-life  issue  is  expected  to  result 
in  a  sharp  increase  in  sales  to  this 
market.  (See  Korean  article  in  this 
issue.) 

Fresh  fruit  export  value  during  J;  mu  ary 
to  September  1995  totaled  $1.48  billion, 
marginally  ahead  of  last  year. 
Increased  export  volumes  and  stronger 
unit  prices  for  citrus  (oranges, 
grapefruit,  and  lemons)  offset 
disappointing  results  for  deciduous  mid 
other  fruit  types.  Although  apple 
exports  are  down  this  year  due  to  a 
smaller  crop  and  higher  prices,  U.S. 
exports  are  gaining  a  larger  share  of 
world  trade.  U.S.  apples  accounted  for 
25  percent  of  global  trade  during  the 
past  marketing  season. 

Exports  of  processed  fruit  and 
vegetables  during  the  first  nine  months 
of  1995  were  valued  at  $1.4  billion,  up 
15  percent  over  1994.  The  improved 


results  largely  are  attributed  to 
increased  stiles  of  frozen  french  fries, 
canned  tomato  products,  and  canned 
com  to  Japtrn,  Canada,  the  United 
Kingdom,  Germmiy,  mid  South  Korea. 

Exports  of  snack  foods  during  the  the 
first  three-quarters  of  1995  declined  to 
$738  million  from  $777  million  in 
1994.  Sales  to  Canada  and  Japan,  the 
two  most  important  export  markets 
which  together  accounted  for  close  to 
half  of  export  value  in  1994,  were  up 
1 1  percent  and  13  percent,  respectively. 
Marked  reductions  in  export  value, 
however,  were  recorded  to  Mexico,  the 
Russian  Federation,  Hong  kong,  and  the 
Philippines. 

Fruit  and  vegetable  juice  exports 
reached  $500  million  during  the  first 
nine  months  of  1995,  up  22  percent 
over  the  same  period  a  year  earlier. 
The  increase  kirgely  is  attributed  to 
heavier  shipments  of  orange  juice. 
Significant  sales  increases  to  Canada, 
Japan,  Western  Europe,  and  Korea  were 
recorded.  Record  U.S.  production  is 
allowing  orange  juice  exports  to  move 
at  a  record  pace.  In  order  to  compete 
with  lower-priced  Brazilian  orange 
juice,  U.S.  sales  are  being  promoted  on 
a  high-quality,  premium  product  basis. 

Exports  ot  fresh  vegetables  to  date  in 
1995  have  totaled  $835  million,  up 
from  $745  million  during  the  smne  nine 
month  period  a  yem  earlier.  A  sharp 
increase  in  the  average  unit  price  of 
lettuce  combined  with  Increased  export 
shipments  of  celery,  cauliflower,  mid 
carrots  account  for  the  larger  export 


value  for  this  consumer  foods  category. 

U.S.  exports  of  poultry  meat  during 
Janum  y  to  September  1995  increased  30 
percent  over  the  same  period  in  1994  to 
$1.4  billion.  The  Russimi  Federation 
continues  as  the  hugest  U.S.  export 
market  with  $391  million  in  shipments 
this  year.  Hong  Kong  recorded  the 
largest  year-to-year  increase  of  $115 
million,  with  exports  during  the  first 
nine  months  of  1995  reaching  $296 
million.  Approximately  70  percent  of 
all  poultry  products  exported  to  Hong 
Kong  in  1995  are  expected  to  be  re¬ 
exported  to  China.  Taken  together, 
poultry  product  shipments  to  Hong 
Kong  and  China  during  Jmiuary  to 
Septennber  1995  have  already  set  a 
new  annual  export  record  of  $320 
million. 

Exports  of  pet  food  (dog  and  cat  food) 
in  1995  reached  $457  million,  up  10 
percent  over  the  first  nine  months  in 
1994.  Increased  sales  to  Japan 
accounted  for  more  than  half  of  the 
total  increase  in  export  value. 
Continued  growth  in  import  demand  for 
pet  food  in  the  Japanese  market  may 
allow  Japan  to  overtake  Canada  as  the 
most  important  U.S.  export  market. 
Modest  increases  in  exports  to  Italy, 
France,  and  Taiwan  were  recorded. 

The  value  of  wine  and  beer  exports 
during  Jmiutiry  to  September  1995 
totaled  $485  million,  up  23  percent 
from  the  $395  million  recorded  in  1994. 
Marked  increases  in  export  volumes  to 
the  United  Kingdom,  Hong  Kong, 
Taiwan,  ;uid  Brazil  were  evident  during 
the  period.

Feature  Story: 

FAS’  Trade  Show  Program  Expands  Exports  of  Consumer 
Ready  Foods 


Exhibiting  in  FAS-sponsored  trade  events  is  one  way  many  small-  and  medium-size  companies  establish  their 
presence  in  export  markets.  The  FAS  trade  show  program  offers  these  firms  a  variety  of  quality  events  for 
promoting  consumer-ready  food  products  in  established  and  emerging  markets.  In  1994,  323  individual  companies 
participated  in  FAS-sponsored  food  shows  and  sales  missions.  Surveys  completed  by  exhibitors  indicate  that  recent 
FAS  shows  facilitated  over  4,700  promising  trade  contacts  and  $60  million  in  new  export  business. 

The  FAS  Trade  Show  Office  offers  LI .S .  food  and  beverage  exporters  a  choice  of  programs  to  satisfy  their  market 
development  needs.  Programs  include  fully  sponsored  trade  shows,  stiles  missions,  and  endorsed  shows  in  both 
leading  markets  and  emerging  markets  worldwide.  In  addition,  a  few  field  offices  independently  organize  sample 
and  catalog  exhibits  and  agent  shows. 

Sponsored  shows:  To  introduce  U.S.  products  in  markets  without  an  established  international  food 
show,  USDA  organizes  its  own  American  food  shows  and  sales  missions.  Sponsored  shows  target 
key  overseas  buyers,  so  U.S.  exhibitors  can  meet  a  select  group  of  decision  makers  with 
purchasing  power.  FAS  offers  exhibitors  a  fully  appointed  booth,  use  of  a  business  lounge, 
shipping  of  product  samples,  marketing  and  public  relations  services,  and  educational  programs. 

Sales  missions:  FAS  package  of  services  includes  an  orientation  to  the  market,  a  trade  reception, 
guaranteed  appointments  with  interested  buyers,  shipping  of  product  samples,  translators  and  in¬ 
country  transportation. 

Endorsed  shows:  FAS  recommends  exhibiting  at  private,  well-managed  international  trade  shows 
in  selected  export  markets.  Organizers  enhance  the  terms  of  participation  for  U.S.  companies  and 
provide  FAS  a  booth  from  which  to  promote  “AgExport  Connections”  trade  services.  Tire 
endorsement  program  thereby  increases  opportunities  for  export  promotion  at  international  food 
shows  a  t  minimal  expense  to  the  government. 

Affordable  Participant  Costs— To  encourage  the  participation  by  all  eligible  companies,  FAS  promotes  many 
economically  priced  events.  Fees  charged  for  booths  range  from  less  than  $2,000  to  approximately  $9,000  for  the 
top  shows  in  Europe.  Fees  charged  for  participation  in  sales  missions  are  as  little  as  $500  per  city  visited.  By 
offering  lower  costs  shows.  FAS  encourages  small-  and  medium-size  firms  to  expand  their  international  marketing 
efforts. 

Attractive  terms  and  conditions  of  participation  are  key  elements  of  FAS  trade  show  events.  These  include: 


Booth  Selection— Exhibitors  select  their  own  booth  on  the  show  floor.  Tins  practice,  which  is 
widespread  in  the  private  trade  show  industry,  has  proven  very  popular  among  participants. 

Shipping  Samples— FAS  offers  unique-in-the-industry  consolidation  and  shipping  services  which 
assure  that  samples  will  be  delivered  directly  to  exhibitors’  booths  on  time  and  in  quality 
condition. 

Exhibitors  Manuals— Each  exhibitor  is  provided  a  binder  containing  shipping  instructions, 
equipment  order  forms,  exhibitor  lists,  show  rules  and  regulations,  market  research,  foreign  buyer 
lists,  hotel  packages  and  other  useful  information  to  make  exhibit  planning  easier. 

Exhibitor  Catalogs— FAS  distributes  to  show  visitors  high  quality  catalogs  that  include  four-color

pictures  and  detailed  product  information,  innovations  that  exceed  industry  standards. 

Educations,  Seminars  and  Tours-FAS  leads  the  field  among  international  show  organizers  in 
organizing  seminars  and  tours  outside  show  hours  to  give  exhibitors  the  information  they  need  to 
succeed  in  foreign  markets. 

In  1995,  FAS  is  introducing  at  trade  shows  a  distinctive  theme  to  promote  U.S.  food  products.  Exhibitors  will 
display  their  goods  under  a  new  American  Foods  banner  accompanied  by  the  slogan  “when  quality  counts.”  Large 
photo  panels  showing  “where  quality  begins”  on  farms  and  ranches  and  demonstrating“where  quality  counts”  with 
foreign  consumers  will  illustrate  the  quality  message.  The  program  is  being  supported  by  new  booth  decorations 
and  a  new  logo.  Changes  reflect  the  Department’s  increasing  role  in  promoting  higher  value,  consumer-ready  food 
products  in  foreign  markets.

Great  American  Food  Show--Korea  ‘96 


The  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture’s  Trade  Show 
Office  invites  U.S.  firms  to  participate  in  the  5th 
Great  American  Food  Show— Korea  '96,  scheduled  for 
March  19-21,  1996  in  Seoul,  Korea.  This  event  will 
provide  American  food  exporters  the  single,  best 
opportunity  to  promote  their  products  in  the  fast¬ 
growing  Korean  market.  Already  the  sixth-largest 
customer  of  U.S.  high-value,  consumer-oriented 
products,  Korea  is  obligated  to  liberalize  trade  in  95 
percent  of  all  products  in  the  food  and  agriculture 
sector  in  1997  as  a  result  of  the  recent  GATT 
negotiations. 

In  1994,  Korean  imports  of  U.S.  consumer-oriented 
food  products  jumped  29  percent  and  during  the  first 
nine  months  of  1995,  imports  are  42  percent  above 
1994  levels.  U.S.  exports  of  consumer-oriented  food 
products  to  Korea  in  1995  are  forecast  at  a  record 
$750  million  while  exports  of  all  agricultural  products 
(excluding  fish  and  wood  products)  are  projected  at 
a  record  $3.85  billion. 

The  Great  American  Food  Show  offers  firms  an 
attractive,  full-service  package,  including  a  fully 
appointed  booth,  product  shipment  and  customs 
clearance,  catalog  entries,  and  high  show  visibility. 
Tire  1996  show,  which  contains  66  booths,  most 
measuring  3x3  meters,  features  a  market  orientation 
tour  prior  to  show  hours  and  a  business  lounge,  daily 
product  delivery,  a  storage  area,  and  communication 
services.  This  show  will  put  you  in  direct  contact 
with  over  3,000  Korean  food  industry  importers, 
agents,  distributors,  wholesalers,  retailers,  storage  and 
transportation  companies,  manufacturers,  and 
processors. 

Product  Eligibility 

All  products  displayed  in  the  Great  American  Food 
Show— Korea  ‘96  must  be  comprised  of  at  least  50

origin  computed  on  a  value  or  volume  basis.  Product 
labels  must  indicate  that  the  products  were  either 
produced  or  processed  in  the  United  States. 

Show  Management 

The  Great  American  Food  Show-Korea  '96  is 
organized  and  managed  by  the  Trade  Show  Office  of 
the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA).  The 


USDA  Trade  Show  Office  is  tut  experienced 
exhibition  organizer  that  has  sponsored  four  to  six 
shows  annually  for  the  past  23  years.

The  application  deadline  for  Finns  seeking  to 
participate  in  the  Great  American  Food  Show— Korea 
'96  initially  had  been  scheduled  to  expire  in  mid- 
November,  but  has  been  extended  to  January  16, 
1996.  Because  initial  interest  has  been  very  high,  the 
show’s  management  reserves  the  right  to  increase  the 
size  of  the  show  as  necessary. 

Previous  Korean  Food  Shows 

USDA’s  Trade  Show  Office  has  considerable 
expericence  conducting  food  shows  in  Korea,  the 
most  recent  of  which  was  the  Great  American  Food 
Show— Korea  ’94.  Indicators  of  success  reported  by 
exhibitors  from  that  show  included: 

73%  of  the  participants  made  contacts  and 
expected  sales.  Estimated  sales  after  the 
show  averaged  over  $200,000  per  company. 

92%  of  participants  expressed  a  desire  to 
participate  in  future  shows. 

45  companies  successfully  test-marketed 
more  than  125  products. 

Approximately  38  percent  of  all  visitors  to  the  1994 
show  were  categorized  as  Korean  food  manufacturers, 
37  percent  were  food  brokers  or  importers,  17  percent 
were  food  distributors,  and  the  remaining  8  percent 
were  classified  as  food  service  providers. 

Show  Facilities 

The  Great  American  Food  Show— Korea  '96  will 
occupy  1,200  square  meters  of  floor  space  and  consist 
of  66  booths.  The  pavilion  includes  a  business 
lounge,  a  storage  area,  daily  product  delivery,  and 
communication  services.  Telephone,  photocopier,  and 
fax  machine  services  will  be  available  in  the  business 
lounge  on  a  fee-for-service  basis.  Incoming  messages 
will  be  delivered  to  exhibitors  as  a  complimentary 
service.

Korea  Buys  Over 
830,000  Tons 

Of  U.S.  Corn 

In  One  Week 

For  the  week  of  Oct.  20-26,  Korea  purchased  over  830,000  tons  of  U.S.  com;  more  than  the 
entire  1993/94  level  of  63 1 ,000  tons.  Last  year,  U.S.  com  exports  to  Korea  reached  an  estimated 
record  of  8.5  million  tons,  due  to  the  lack  of  Chinese  presence  in  the  market.  As  of  November 
23,  Korea  has  purchased  more  than  4.9  million  tons  of  U.S.  corn  for  delivery  in  1995/96 
(Oct/Sept).  USDA  projects  total  com  imports  at  9  million  tons  down  slightly  from  9.1  million 
tons  last  year.  The  absence  of  feed  wheat  and  Chinese  com  from  the  world  market,  coupled 
with  increasing  demand  for  feed  in  Korea,  will  likely  result  in  further  strong  U.S.  corn  sales 
there. 

Russia  Buys  105,000 
Tons  of  U.S.  Wheat 

Russia  has  purchased  105,000  tons  of  U.S.  wheat  for  the  1995/96  marketing  year.  Of  this  total, 
80,000  tons  has  been  registered  under  the  GSM- 102  prognun  which  would  use  half  the  $30 
million  available  for  a  basket  of  commodities.  The  U.S.  exported  400,000  tons  of  wheat  to 
Russia  in  1994/95.  With  declining  availabilities  in  Russia  and  Kazakhstan,  there  has  been 
speculation  that  more  purchasing  from  Western  sources  may  be  in  the  works. 

Saudia  Arabia  Suddenly  Saudi  Arabia  bought  about  900,000  tons  of  barley  for  November-Deceinber  arrival  despite 


Tenders  for  Barley 

extremely  tight  global  supplies  and  historically  high  prices.  At  least  100,000  tons  of  U.S.  Barley 
will  be  shipped  as  part  of  this  tender  purchase.  World  barley  prices  have  increased  50  percent, 
(to  approximately  $190  FOB),  since  Saudi  Arabia  last  bought  in  July.  This  tender  is  optional- 
origin,  but  it  is  doubtful  that  the  entire  quantity  can  be  covered  from  any  one  country. 

Korea’s  Intends  To 
Purchase  Higher 
Quality  Oranges 

Korea's  fresh  orange  importing  entity,  the  Cheju  Citrus  Grower's  Agricultural  Cooperative,  is 
considering  the  purchase  of  higher  quality  oranges  under  the  1996  Umguay  Round  tariff  rate 
quota.  As  provided  for  under  the  Umguay  Round  agreement,  Korea  established  a  15,000-ton 
import  quota  in  1995,  and  subsequently  filled  the  quota  exclusively  with  U.S.  oranges.  Quality 
problems  were  subsequently  encountered  with  the  imported  oranges.  The  coop's  low-bid 
tendering  system  is  believed  to  have  contributed  to  some  of  the  quality  difficulties.  The 
president  of  the  coop  has  stated  that  it  would  be  attempting  under  next  year's  20,000-ton  quota 
to  import  at  least  some  quantities  of  premium  quality  oranges.  The  coop  reportedly  will  begin 
purchasing  under  the  quota  in  January,  with  imports  continuing  on  a  consistent  and  steady  basis. 
Earlier  reports,  suggesting  that  the  coop  would  delay  quota  purchases  until  as  late  as  April, 
which  would  be  problematic  for  U.S.  exporters  given  our  marketing  season  for  navel  oranges, 
tire  now  being  discounted. 

USDA  Announces 
Special  Import  Quota 
For  Cotton 

On  Nov.  22,  1995,  USDA  announced  the  twelfth  special  import  quota  for  upland  cotton  to  be 
triggered  this  year.  The  special  import  quota,  which  is  the  result  of  high  U.S.  cotton  prices,  will 
permit  the  importation  of  43,624,810  kilograms  (200,367  bales)  upland  cotton.  The  quota  was 
established  on  November  22  and  applies  to  upland  cotton  purchased  by  February  19,  1996,  and 
entered  into  the  United  States  not  later  than  May  19,  1996.  Cotton  imported  under  the  special 
import  quota  is  not  subject  to  the  over-quota  tariff  rate  of  the  tariff-rate  quota  implemented  under 
the  Uruguay  Round  agreement.  The  quota  is  not  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
U.S.  cotton  supply  and  demand  situation.  Less  than  six  thousand  bales  have  been  imported 
under  the  previous  eight  quotas  established  this  year.  The  additional  costs  associated  with 
importing  foreign  cotton  and  quality  considerations  are  key  factors  in  limiting  cotton  imports 
under  these  quotas.

Hungary  Suspends 
Export  Subsidies 

For  Grains 

On  October  28,  the  Government  of  Hungary  announced  the  suspension  of  export  subsidies  for 
milling  wheat,  wheat  flour,  and  corn.  The  action,  prompted  by  soaring  bread  prices  and  ferns 
of  domestic  grain  shortages,  follows  the  October  12  suspension  of  the  issuance  of  export  licenses 
for  wheat  and  wheat  Hour.  Wheat  export  subsidies  will  still  be  gnuited  for  all  shipments 
contracted  before  October  28,  and  delivered  by  December  31,  1995,  while  wheat  flour  and  corn 
will  receive  subsidies  only  for  shipments  before  October  28.  Furthermore,  the  Government 
introduced  licensing  requirements  for  com  exports,  although  licenses  are  unlikely  to  he  issued 
following  this  year's  corn  hmvest. 

Mexico  Sets  Shelf-Life 
Standards  for  Milk 

In  response  to  concerns  expressed  by  USDA,  FDA,  and  trade  interests,  Mexico's  Secretariat  of 
Health  (SSA)  has  agreed  to  eliminate  its  proposed  48-hour  shelf-life  restriction  on  pasteurized 
milk.  Instead  of  a  mandatory  limit,  both  domestic  and  foreign  suppliers  will  be  allowed  to 
establish  voluntary  expiration  dates  for  their  products.  In  October  1994,  SSA  included  the  48- 
hour  limit  as  part  of  its  sanitary  specification  for  fresh  milk.  If  it  had  become  law,  the  48-hour 
limit  would  have  severely  restricted  entry  of  U.S.  products.  In  1994,  U.S.  exports  of  fluid  milk 
and  cream  totaled  $34.5  million.  The  pace  of  sales  has  slowed  considerably  in  1995  due  to  the 
devaluation  of  the  peso,  but  that  should  chmige  when  the  Mexican  economy  recovers. 

Venezuelean  Foreign 
Exchange  Policy 
Threatens  Wheat 
Imports 

A  Government  clamp-down  on  foreign  exchange  approvals  for  Venezuelan  importers  is  hindering 
the  ability  of  most  wheat  importers  to  secure  adequate  supplies.  The  Government  of  Venezuela 
suspended  foreign  exchange  approvals  in  September  due  to  concerns  over  shrinking  foreign 
reserves  resulting  from  a  seriously  overhauled  Bolivar.  The  ability  to  import  is  especially  critical 
for  wheat  because  Venezuela  is  almost  entirely  dependent  on  imported  wheat.  Once  imports 
resume,  U.S.  wheat  stands  to  benefit  as  suppliers  that  can  deliver  promptly  will  likely  have  a 
competitive  advantage.  In  addition,  new  exchtuige  regulations  affecting  the  timing  of  exchange 
authorizations  will  dnunatically  increase  importer  risk  when  foreign  exchange  approvals  resume. 

U.S.  Exports  to  China 
Much  Larger  Than 
Revealed  by  U.S. 

Trade  Data 

U.S.  agricultural  exports  to  China  are  much  higher  than  revealed  by  U.S.  Census  export  data. 
Our  official  trade  data  fails  to  capture  the  significant  amount  of  U.S.  products  re-exported  to 
China  from  Hong  Kong.  In  1994,  U.S.  Census  recorded  consumer-oriented  food  exports  to  the 
People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  touded  $48.9  million,  making  it  our  36th  largest  imirket  for 
such  products.  Hong  Kong  trade  data  shows  re-exports  of  such  U.S.  products  to  the  PRC  totaled 
$258  million.  Combining  direct  and  indirect  exports,  the  PRC  market  leaps  to  $307  million, 
making  it  our  l()th  largest  imirket  in  1994.  Up  to  one  half  or  more  of  such  imports  are 
consumed  in  southern  China,  with  the  balance  sold  by  South  China  importers  to  East  and  North 
China  buyers.  U.S.  re-exports  may  be  even  greater,  according  to  China  mid  Hong  Kong  traders, 
due  to  substantial  Hong  Kong  to  PRC  smuggling  not  recorded  by  Hong  Kong  Census  authorities. 

There  are  similar  examples  of  undercounted  U.S.  exports  of  bulk  tind  intermediate  commodities, 
as  well  as  forest  products.  U.S.  exports  of  hides  and  skins  exports  to  Hong  Kong  virtually  me 
all  re-exported  to  China.  Hong  Kong,  Taiwan,  and  Korea  are  moving  pollution  mid  labor 
intensive  t mining  operations  to  the  PRC.  Combined  U.S.  hide  exports  to  China  ;ind  Hong  Kong 
totaled  $96.4  million  in  1994.  Likewise,  much  of  Hong  Kong's  cotton  spinning  operations  have 
relocated  across  the  border,  tttking  advantage  of  lower  labor  and  kind  costs.  This  means  that  a 
significant  portion  of  the  $118  million  in  U.S.  cotton  exports  to  Hong  Kong  in  1994  were 
ultimately  destined  for  PRC  mills.

Philippines  Imports 
Com  Despite  Delayed 
UR  Implementation 

At  the  urging  of  the  domestic  feed  industry,  which  is  facing  a  5  to  10  percent  annual  demand 
growth  for  compound  feed,  the  Philippines  will  soon  tender  for  150,000  tons  of  com  for  prompt 
shipment.  The  Philippines  purchased  137,000  tons  of  com  from  the  United  States  and  Argentina 
a  few  months  ago,  the  first  com  imports  in  four  years.  Under  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreement, 
the  Philippines  is  committed  to  a  35  percent  tariff  rate  quota  of  at  least  133,000  tons  in  1995/96 
with  graduated  annual  increases  to  217,000  tons  in  the  year  2004.  The  Philippines  has  yet  to 
change  domestic  legislation  and  implement  its  Uruguay  Round  agricultural  commitments. 
Therefore,  the  imports  must  he  accomplished  under  restrictive  government  licensing. 

Poultry  Exports 

To  Russia 

The  Russian  Federation  will  require  that  all  U.S.  poultry  plants  processing  product  for  the 
Russi;m  market  be  inspected  mid  approved  by  the  Russian  Veterinary  Department.  This 
requirement  results  from  some  shipments  of  allegedly  spoiled  poultry.  Russian  officials  have 
agreed  to  honor  the  present  FS1S  poultry  certificate  and  approved  plants  until  the  Russian 
inspection  occurs  mid  a  list  of  Russian  approved  plants  is  established.  Therefore,  trade  should 
not  be  disrupted.  The  Russian  Federation  is  expected  to  import  about  610,000  tons  of  U.S. 
poultry  this  year. 

U.S.-Canada  Potato 
Talks  Yield  Mixed 
Results 

During  the  annual  U.S.-Canada  industry/government  potato  talks  held  November  6-7  in  Ottawa, 
Agriculture  Canada  (AgCmiada)  reported  that  the  two-year  exemption  for  Canadian  french  fry 
processors  from  packaging  size  limitations  currently  imposed  on  U.S.  imports  had  expired  on 
November  3.  At  the  same  time,  AgCanada  officials  gave  no  indication  that  the  current 
restrictions  on  bulk  shipments  would  be  relaxed.  Prior  to  November  1993,  U.S.  companies  were 
limited  to  selling  their  frozen  potatoes  to  Canada  in  bags  no  hirger  than  two  kilograms  (4.4 
pounds),  less  than  the  five  pounds  of  french  fries  necessary  to  fill  a  standard  food  service  frying 
unit.  In  November  1993,  the  United  States  negotiated  a  permanent  change  in  this  policy  to 
permit  imports  in  sizes  up  to  20  kilograms.  However,  U.S.  firms  could  still  not  sell  in  five-pound 
bags,  the  industry  norm  throughout  the  world,  due  to  a  500-gram  multiple  requirement. 
Meanwhile,  Canadian  french  fry  processors  received  a  two-year  exemption  from  (he  required 
metric  packaging  for  the  food  service  market,  which  afforded  them  a  distinct  marketing 
advantage  in  supplying  the  growing  Canadian  food  service  and  institutional  markets  with  the 
standard  five-pound  package.  On  December  8,  1995,  Canada  announced  new  guidelines  for 
these  "larger-than-large"  package  sizes  which  will  exempt  inner  containers  from  certain  labeling 
and  packaging  requirements  and  should  facilitate  increased  exports.  Still  unresolved  is  Canada's 
restriction  on  the  bulk  importation  of  fresh  potatoes,  which  remains  a  serious  trade  irritant  for 
the  U.S.  potato  industry.  Canada  generally  prohibits  entry  of  fresh  potatoes  in  containers  larger 
than  50  kilograms.  Importers  may  request  waivers,  but  Canadian  authorities  will  deny  the 
petition  if  equivalent  local  product  is  available.  U.S.  potato  industry  sources  estimate  that  $5 
million  of  exports  are  forfeited  annually  due  to  the  bulk  import  restriction. 

Taiwan  Wheat  Prices 
Increased  for  First 
Time  in  Four  Years 

Because  of  higher  world  wheat  prices,  Taiwan's  Council  of  Agriculture  raised  the  controlled 
landed  price  of  imported  wheat  from  $  195/ton  to  $245/ton  on  November  14.  In  Turn  ary,  when 
pipeline  stocks  are  replenished  with  the  higher  priced  wheat,  the  ceiling  on  flour  prices  will  be 
increased  18  percent.  Since  1991,  the  price  for  wheat  imports  has  been  fixed  at  $195/ton. 
Although  all  wheat  imported  this  year  has  been  U.S.  No.l  Grade  wheat,  flour  millers  may 
consider  price  and  tender  for  No.2  quality.  Taiwan's  annual  wheat  imports  have  been  fairly 
stable  at  900,000  tons.

EU  Poultry  Plants 
Approved  by 

Videotape  for 

Exports  to  Brunei 

All  food  products  exported  to  Bmnei  must  he  halal-certified.  Meat  processors  in  Denmark  ;ind 
Holland  reportedly  received  temporary  halal  certification  from  Bmnei,  following  the  submission 
of  a  video  tape  of  their  plant's  slaughtering  techniques.  The  plants  will  still  need  to  undergo  a 
successful,  in-person  review  by  the  Government  of  Brunei's  religious,  health,  and  agriculture 
officials  prior  to  being  granted  full  certification.  U.S.  poultry  exporters  may  want  to  explore  this 
same  certification  avenue  to  the  Bmnei  market  by  sending  a  video  tape  to  interested  importers 
in  Brunei.  Although  Brunei  is  a  relatively  small  country  with  a  population  of  approximately 
285,000,  income  levels  are  relatively  high  at  $9,000  per  capita,  and  the  potential  market  for  U.S. 
poultry  products  should  not  be  overlooked. 

U.S.  Positioned 

To  Take  Larger 

Claim  in  Brazilian 
Wheat  Market 

The  United  States  has  already  sold  863,000  tons  of  wheat  to  Brazil  for  1996/97  (June-May)  in 
addition  to  the  453,000  tons  sold  for  delivery  during  the  current  1995/96  marketing  year.  This 
is  the  highest  level  of  U.S.  wheat  exports  to  Brazil  since  1984/85  when  the  United  States 
exported  3  million  tons  and  captured  75  percent  of  the  Brazilian  market.  The  large  U.S. 
purchases  reflect  importer  expectations  ot  poor  Argentine  crop  prospects  mid  a  shift  in  Canadian 
Wheat  Board  focus  to  China.  This  combination  of  factors  is  creating  increased  U.S.  opportunity 
throughout  Latin  America.  Brazilian  import  demtind  for  1995/96  is  currently  in  the  range  of 
6.5  million  tons. 

Philippines  To  Import 

Up  to  500,000 

Tons  of  Rice 

The  Government  of  the  Philippines  has  announced  that  it  will  import  up  to  500,000  tons  of  rice 
in  the  coming  months  to  alleviate  possible  shortages  resulting  from  damage  to  the  domestic  crop 
caused  by  cyclone  Angela.  The  rice  likely  will  be  supplied  by  Thailand,  India  and  Vietnam. 
Imports  of  U.S.  rice  likely  will  be  limited  by  P.L.  480  availability.  Despite  the  Government's 
claim  of  storm  damage  to  the  domestic  crop,  many  amdysts  believe  that  crop  losses  were 
relatively  light  since  the  Philippine  rice  fuirvest  was  already  well  underway  when  the  storm 
arrived.  The  Government's  efforts  to  tie  rice  import  needs  to  storm  damage  is  viewed  as  ;in 
attempt  to  avoid  political  opposition  to  imports  from  Philippine  fanners. 

South  American 
Restrictions  on 

U.S.  Fruits 

And  Vegetables 

Recent  detections  of  oriental  fruit  flies  in  California  have  prompted  several  South  American 
countries  to  impose  new  trade  restrictions  on  imports  of  U.S.  fruits  and  vegetables.  Ecuador, 
initially  tenninated  imports  from  all  U.S.  origins.  Upwards  of  20  containers  of  Pacific  Northwest 
apples  were  being  held  in  port  but  subsequently  were  released  for  entry.  Some  shipments  of 
California  fruit,  however,  still  are  being  held  at  the  port  of  entry.  Several  containers  of 
California  fruit  also  are  reported  to  be  enroute  to  that  country.  Colombia  has  formulated  a 
decree  that  would  impose  new,  potentially  troublesome  conditions  on  the  entry  of  fruits  and 
vegetables  originating  from  the  state  of  California.  Colombian  trade  sources  indicate  that  several 
orders  for  California  fruit  have  been  canceled  in  response  to  the  action  taken  by  the  Colombian 
government.  Argentina,  the  first  country  to  take  action,  suspended  imports  of  fresh  fruits  ;tnd 
vegetables  from  California  effective  October  27.  Brazil  also  had  imposed  an  embargo  on  fruit 
and  vegetable  imports  from  California  on  November  7.  However,  following  discussions  on  the 
issue  and  an  exchange  of  technical  information,  Brazil  lifted  the  import  suspension  the  week  of 
November  13.  USDA's  Animal  Pkint  Health  Inspection  Service  (APHIS)  has  agreed  to  certify 
that  export  shipments  originate  in  fly-free  zones.  An  APHIS  official  traveled  to  Chile  to  discuss 
the  situation  with  local  plant  protection  officials.  APHIS  provided  these  countries  with 
background  information  and  technical  materials  related  to  the  detections,  15  of  which  have  been 
made  in  the  Los  Angeles  Basin  during  the  past  five  months.  None  of  the  reported  fly  detections 
have  occurred  ne;tr  commercial  growing  areas.  Furthermore,  the  detections  have  not  met  APHIS' 
criteria  for  an  infestation.

U.S.  Apple  Exports 
Capture  25-Percent 
Global  Market  Share 

As  Sales  Set  Record 

The  U.S.  share  of  global  apple  exports  (excluding  EU  intra-trade),  continuing  its  upward  trend, 
reached  25  percent  during  marketing  year  1994/95  (July/June).  This  amount  was  almost  double 
the  13-percent  share  recorded  in  1988/89.  By  volume,  exports  of  U.S.  apples  surged  to  a  record 
697,829  tons  during  1994/95,  a  15-percent  increase  from  last  season.  In  value  terms,  shipments 
increased  to  a  record  $423  million,  13  percent  above  last  year.  Asia  continues  to  lead  the  U.S. 
export  performance  for  apples,  with  six  of  the  10  top  markets  located  in  the  region.  Exports  to 
Taiwan  in  1994/95,  the  United  States'  top  export  market,  were  up  13  percent,  reaching  a  record 

1 15,000  tons.  Canada,  Mexico,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  United  Arab  Emirates  comprise  the 
remaining  top  markets.  Market  Promotion  Program  activities  in  many  of  these  countries  helped 
boost  U.S.  sales.  For  1995/96,  total  exports  of  U.S.  apples  are  forecast  at  605,000  tons,  down 
13  percent  from  last  year,  based  on  the  reduced  U.S.  crop  and  the  resulting  higher  prices. 

Slow  Barley 

Deliveries  Constrain 
Canadian  Exports 

For  the  third  time  this  year,  the  Canadian  Wheat  Board  (CWB)  increased  its  initial  producer 
payment  for  feed  barley.  This  most  recent  19  percent  increase  represents  an  aggressive  attempt 
of  the  CWB  to  avoid  repeating  last  year's  shortfall  in  deliveries  and  resulting  export  delays. 
Canadian  growers  have  been  selling  their  barley  to  the  domestic  feed  market  on  holding  onto 
stocks  to  capture  additional  price  rises.  The  CWB  has  been  unable  to  renew  its  barley  supply 
agreement  with  the  Japanese  Food  Agency  after  falling  short  of  the  minimum  800,000  tons 
specified  in  the  1995  agreement. 

Record  Exports  of 
Dairy,  Livestock, 

And  Poultry 

Products  to  China 

Total  U.S.  exports  of  livestock,  dairy,  and  poultry  products  to  China  for  the  first  nine  months 
of  1995  were  $158  million,  nearly  147  percent  higher  than  the  $64  million  sold  for  the  same 
period  a  year  ago.  The  Chinese  bought  inedible  tallow  ($34  million),  fresh  or  wet-salted  cattle 
hides  ($56  million),  and  a  uniquely  American  product,  buffalo  hides  ($9  million).  On  the  poultry 
and  dairy  side,  the  Chinese  purchased  frozen  chicken  parts  ($22  million),  dried  whey  ($3.2 
million),  baby  chicks  ($5.9  million),  and  down  for  stuffing  ($1.8  million).  Exports  of  U.S. 
consumer-oriented  food  products  to  China  are  expected  to  continue  to  grow  in  1995  and  1996, 
especially  due  to  the  rapidly  rising  incomes  of  China's  400  million  urban  consumers. 

U.S.  Exports  of 

Dairy,  Livestock, 

And  Poultry  Products 
To  Hong  Kong 

Break  Records 

Total  U.S.  sales  of  dairy,  poultry  and  livestock  products  to  Hong  Kong  cleared  a  record  $447 
million  in  the  first  nine  months  of  1995,  49  percent  higher  than  the  $299  million  sold  for  the 
same  period  in  1994.  The  leading  products  were  frozen  chicken  parts  ($276  million),  fresh  or 
wet-salted  cattle  hides  ($20.3  million),  fresh  mid  processed  eggs  ($16  million),  and  frozen,  edible 
beef  offal  ($12.4  million).  The  Chinese  Government  recently  ended  a  duty-waiver  policy  for  its 
special  economic  zones.  As  a  result,  Chinese  importers  are  looking  to  source  their  product 
through  Hong  Kong.  Approximately  65  percent  of  all  U.S.  poultry  products  exported  to  Hong 
Kong  in  1994  were  re-exported  to  China.  This  figure  has  increased  to  at  least  70  percent  in 
1995.  Taken  together,  the  China-Hong  Kong  market  represents  a  $780-million  annual  market 
for  U.S.  poultry,  dairy,  and  livestock  products.
