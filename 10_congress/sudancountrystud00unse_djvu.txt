Foreword 


This  volume  is  the  last  in  a  series  of  books  prepared  by  the  Federal 
Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress  under  the  Country  Studies/ 
Area  Handbook  Program,  formerly  sponsored  by  the  Department  of  the 
Army  and  temporarily  revived  in  FY  2004  with  congressionally  man¬ 
dated  funding  under  the  sponsorship  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  Strategic 
Plans  and  Policy  Directorate  (J-5). 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  country,  describ¬ 
ing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and  national  security  sys¬ 
tems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the  interrelationships  of  those 
systems  and  the  ways  they  are  shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  factors. 
Each  study  is  written  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists.  The 
authors  seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  society, 
striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular  attention  is 
devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society,  their  origins,  dominant 
beliefs  and  values,  their  common  interests  and  the  issues  on  which  they 
are  divided,  the  nature  and  extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  insti¬ 
tutions,  and  their  attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  sys¬ 
tem  and  political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should  not  be  con¬ 
strued  as  an  expression  of  an  official  U.S.  government  position,  policy,  or 
decision.  The  authors  have  sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards  of 
scholarly  objectivity.

Preface 


This  edition  of  Sudan:  A  Country  Study  is  a  revised  and  updated  ver¬ 
sion  that  replaces  the  1992  edition  edited  by  Helen  Chapin  Metz.  As  with 
other  volumes  in  the  Country  Studies  series,  it  attempts  to  cover  in  a  con¬ 
cise  fashion  the  history,  society,  environment,  economy,  government,  and 
security  sector  of  a  contemporary  nation,  in  this  case,  the  Republic  of  the 
Sudan.  The  text  is  based  on  a  variety  of  sources  including  books,  scholarly 
journals,  foreign  and  domestic  newspapers,  official  reports  of  govern¬ 
ments  and  international  organizations,  and  numerous  periodicals  and  Web 
sites  on  Sudan,  Africa,  and  the  Middle  East.  At  the  end  of  each  chapter  is 
a  bibliographic  essay  in  which  the  author  discusses  the  main  sources  used 
in  the  chapter.  Complete  citations  for  all  chapters  are  included  in  the  com¬ 
prehensive  bibliography  at  the  end  of  the  volume. 

While  this  study  was  in  production,  the  10  Southern  states  of  Sudan 
voted  overwhelmingly  to  break  away,  and  in  mid-July  2011  they  formed 
an  independent  nation,  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan.  In  view  of  this 
development,  the  five  chapters  of  the  volume  cover  events  in  the  whole  of 
Sudan  up  to  early  2011  and  hence  do  not  deal  with  South  Sudan  as  an 
independent  country.  Events  in  Sudan  and  South  Sudan  since  their  sepa¬ 
ration  are  included  in  the  Introduction  and  in  the  Country  Profile,  both 
current  as  of  early  August  2014. 

Every  effort  has  been  made  to  include  the  most  accurate  and  recent 
information  throughout  the  volume.  However,  locating  current  informa¬ 
tion  on  both  Sudan  and  South  Sudan  is  often  a  difficult  task.  Information 
that  is  available  may  be  fragmentary  or  not  up  to  date.  This  problem  is 
especially  the  case  with  respect  to  statistical  data  on  such  topics  as  the 
economy  or  the  education  and  health  sectors.  Demographic  information 
has  fared  better  because  the  latest  national  census  was  conducted  in  2008. 
In  general,  current  information  on  security  forces  is  scarce  if  not  lacking 
altogether. 

The  spelling  of  contemporary  place-names  conforms  in  most  cases  to 
the  system  approved  by  the  U.S.  Board  on  Geographic  Names.  However, 
in  cases  where  the  Board's  version  might  prove  confusing,  we  have 
retained  spellings  in  English  that  are  in  common  use,  for  example,  Al- 
Obeid  instead  of  Al-Ubayyid.  With  regard  to  personal  names  and  terms  in 
Arabic,  we  have  followed  the  transliteration  system  of  the  Library  of  Con- 
gress-American  Library  Association,  with  modifications.  In  instances 
where  names  are  commonly  rendered  in  English,  we  have  used  the  familiar 


xv 


form  rather  than  one  that  might  not  be  recognizable  to  the  reader,  and  no 
diacritics  are  used  except  for  apostrophes  (’)  and  hyphens  (-). 

Unfamiliar  terms  are  defined  in  the  text;  more  extended  definitions  are 
found  in  the  Glossary  at  the  end  of  the  volume.  As  an  aid  to  the  reader, 
abbreviations  and  acronyms  that  appear  in  the  text  are  listed  with  then- 
expanded  form  in  Table  A,  and  a  chronology  of  significant  events  from 
antiquity  to  2014  appears  in  Table  B.  Metric  measurements  are  used 
throughout  the  text.  Table  1  in  the  Appendix  contains  a  conversion  chart 
to  assist  those  readers  unfamiliar  with  metric  measurements.  Because  the 
boundaries  and  names  of  Sudan’s  administrative  divisions  have  changed 
since  the  early  1990s,  the  administrative  divisions  map  for  Sudan  in  1991 
given  in  chapter  one  serves  for  reference  there  and  in  succeeding  chapters. 
An  administrative  divisions  map  of  Sudan  in  201 1  appears  in  the  front  of 
the  book.  Current  maps  of  both  Sudan  and  South  Sudan  are  in  the  Intro¬ 
duction.

Historical  Background 

Since  antiquity,  Sudan’s  history  has  centered  around  a  succession  of 
states  along  the  northern  Nile  and  around  cultural,  military,  and  political 
relations  with  the  Egyptians  to  the  north.  The  ancient  Egyptians  at  times 
controlled  the  northern  Sudanese  lands  of  Nubia  and  Cush  and  fostered 
an  Egyptianized  population  that  ruled  Egypt  in  the  early  first  millennium 
B.C.  A  few  centuries  later,  the  commercial  state  of  Meroe  dominated  the 
central  Nile.  In  the  mid-fourth  century  A.D.,  Meroe  succumbed  to  inva¬ 
sion  and  was  succeeded  by  three  states  with  cultural  ties  with  Egypt, 
including  Orthodox  Christianity. 

During  the  fourteenth  century,  Islam  was  introduced  from  Egypt. 
Together  with  migrations  from  the  north,  Islam  gradually  changed  the 
nature  of  Sudanese  society.  Islam  facilitated  the  division  of  the  country 
into  northern  and  southern  halves,  one  Arab  and  Muslim,  the  other  Afri¬ 
can  and  animist,  a  division  that  persists  today.  The  Funj  kingdom  cen¬ 
tered  at  Sinnar  on  the  Blue  Nile  and  the  sultanate  of  Darfur  in  the  west 
flourished  in  and  after  the  sixteenth  century.  In  the  early  nineteenth  cen¬ 
tury,  the  Egyptians  once  more  asserted  control  over  much  of  Sudan. 
They  divided  the  country  into  provinces  and  brought  the  Southern  peo¬ 
ples  into  their  administrative  system  based  at  Khartoum.  Slavery  and  the 
slave  trade  intensified  during  the  nineteenth  century  and  instilled  in 
Southerners  fear  and  hatred  of  the  Northern  Arabs.  In  the  early  1880s, 
an  Islamic  cleric  declared  himself  the  long-awaited  Mahdi.  He  led  his 
followers,  the  Ansar,  in  a  revolt  that  drove  out  the  Egyptians  and  their 
Ottoman  Turk  and  British  overlords  and  established  his  dominion  over 
much  of  northern  and  central  Sudan. 

This  Mahdist  state  lasted  until  1898,  when  the  Egyptians  and  British 
returned,  defeated  the  Ansar,  and  established  a  joint  administration,  the 
Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium,  which  made  Sudan  in  effect  a  British  col¬ 
ony.  British  colonial  officials  fostered  a  system  of  administration  from  the 
central  Nile  region  which  entailed  the  neglect  of  peripheral  areas,  and  sep¬ 
arated  the  Southern  provinces  of  Upper  Nile,  Equatoria,  and  Bahr  al- 
Ghazal  from  the  North.  The  latter  were  largely  left  to  their  own  devices, 
economic  and  political  development  being  concentrated  along  the  central 
Nile. 

Sudan  gained  its  independence  from  Britain  in  1956.  Since  then,  it  has 
alternated  between  civilian  and  military  government,  the  latest  of  which 
is  the  present  regime  of  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al-Bashir.  The  attempt  to 


xxvi 


impose  Islam  and  sharia  on  the  South  aroused  Southerners  to  rebel 
against  the  central  government,  first  in  1963  and  then  a  second  time  in 
1983.  After  a  huge  loss  of  life  and  displacement  among  Southerners,  this 
second  rebellion  ended  in  2005  with  the  signing  of  the  Comprehensive 
Peace  Agreement,  which  provided  for  a  Government  of  National  Unity 
with  separate  administrations  for  the  North  and  the  South.  It  also  pro¬ 
vided  that  after  a  six-year  interval,  Southerners  would  decide  upon  con¬ 
tinued  unity  with  Northern  Sudan  or  independence.  On  January  9, 201 1, 
Southerners  chose  independence,  which  became  effective  the  following 
July  9.  The  two  countries  then  began  to  deal  with  the  issues  involved  in 
their  separation,  including  boundaries,  citizenship,  debt,  and  oil  reve¬ 
nues.  In  2003  another  rebellion  broke  out  in  Darfur  in  protest  of  eco¬ 
nomic  and  political  marginalization.  After  a  large  loss  of  life  and 
displacement  of  civilians  and  despite  efforts  at  peace-making,  the  Darfur 
war  remained  unresolved.  In  2014  Sudan  was  engaged  in  a  debate  about 
a  new  constitution  and  political  order  and  was  faced  with  rebellions  in 
Darfur  and  in  South  Kordofan  and  Blue  Nile  States.  In  December  2013, 
civil  war  broke  out  in  South  Sudan  between  its  two  largest  ethnic 
groups,  the  Dinka  and  the  Nuer,  and  continued  into  2014. 

Geography 

Size:  Sudan’s  total  area  equals  2,505,813  square  kilometers;  land  area 
2,376,000  square  kilometers;  coastline  835  kilometers.  Until  2011,  it  was, 
geographically,  the  largest  country  in  Africa.  The  total  area  of  Sudan  is 
now  1,861,484  square  kilometers.  The  total  area  of  South  Sudan  is 
644,329  square  kilometers. 

Topography:  Sudan  is  a  land  of  plateaus  and  plains.  Low  mountains  are 
found  behind  the  Red  Sea  coast,  in  the  far  south,  and  in  the  far  west.  The 
only  interior  highlands  of  consequence  are  the  Nuba  Mountains  west  of 
the  White  Nile.  All  significant  streams  flow  into  the  White  Nile  or  Blue 
Nile,  which  join  at  Khartoum  to  form  the  River  Nile.  Extensive  swamps 
are  found  in  the  south,  especially  along  the  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  the  Bahr 
al-Jabal,  the  principal  southernmost  tributaries  of  the  White  Nile. 

Climate:  Rainfall  ranges  from  rare  and  occasional  in  the  far  northern 
desert  to  relatively  abundant  and  frequent  (rainy  seasons  of  six  to  nine 
months)  in  the  southern  third  of  the  country.  In  most  years,  central 
Sudan  has  enough  rain  for  agriculture,  but  a  lack  of  rain  the  1970s, 
1980s,  and  1990s  caused  severe  drought.  Dust  storms,  often  accompa¬ 
nying  the  arrival  of  the  annual  southwesterly  rains  in  May-July,  are 
common  in  central  and  parts  of  northern  Sudan,  reducing  visibility  and 
causing  much  discomfort.  Mean  temperatures  and  daily  maximums  are 


xxvii 


generally  high;  desert  temperatures  can  be  quite  cool  at  night.  Desertifi¬ 
cation,  deforestation,  and  land  degradation  are  among  severe  environ¬ 
mental  problems. 

Society 

Population:  Sudan:  37.9  million;  South  Sudan:  11.3  million  (both  2013 
World  Bank  estimates).  According  to  Sudan’s  most  recent  census  of 
April  2008,  total  population  was  39.2  million,  30.9  million  in  Northern 
Sudan  and  8.3  million  in  Southern  Sudan;  just  over  47  percent  were  aged 
16  years  or  younger.  Population  growth  peaked  in  the  1980s  at  3.3  per¬ 
cent  a  year  but  declined  thereafter;  in  2008  the  annual  growth  rate  was 
estimated  at  2.1  percent.  Roughly  two-thirds  of  the  population  lives 
within  300-500  kilometers  of  Khartoum,  with  concentration  in  the  Khar¬ 
toum  area.  In  2012  life  expectancy  was  62  years  in  the  North,  55  years  in 
the  South  (World  Bank  estimates). 

Languages:  Sudan  is  one  of  the  most  ethnically  and  linguistically 
diverse  nations  in  the  world.  Its  people  speak  more  than  400  languages 
and  dialects.  Until  the  early  2000s,  Arabic  was  the  official  language,  but 
English  was  also  widely  spoken,  particularly  in  the  South.  The  Compre¬ 
hensive  Peace  Agreement  of  2005  established  Arabic  and  English  as 
equal  working  languages  of  government  and  society,  but  today  Arabic  is 
again  the  official  language  in  the  North,  and  English  continues  in  wide 
use  in  the  South.  Other  major  languages  are  Bedawiye,  a  Cushitic  tongue 
spoken  by  the  Beja  nomads  of  the  East,  and  the  Nilotic  languages  of  the 
Nuer  (Naadh)  and  Dinka  (Jieng)  spoken  in  the  South. 

Ethnic  Groups:  Sudan’s  population  consists  of  some  600  ethnic  groups, 
broadly  divided  into  Muslims  and  non-Muslims.  Among  Muslims,  about 
40  percent  identify  themselves  as  “Arabs”  by  culture  and  language  and 
reside  largely  in  Northern  Sudan.  Other  Northern  but  non-Arab  groups 
are  the  Nubians  along  the  northern  Nile  and  in  the  Kassala  area,  the  Beja 
in  the  East,  and  the  Fur  in  the  West.  Major  Southern  non-Muslim  groups 
are  the  Dinka  (Jieng),  Nuer  (Naadh),  and  Shilluk  (Collo).  The  Nuba,  a 
separate  group  culturally  and  linguistically,  reside  in  the  mountains  of 
South  Kordofan. 

Religion:  Islam,  Christianity,  and  traditional  African  religions  are  all 
found  in  Sudan.  Perhaps  three-fourths  of  Sudan’s  population  is  Muslim. 
Sudanese  are  uniformly  Sunni,  although  many  are  adherents  of  Sudan’s 
Sufi  brotherhoods — Ansar,  Khatmiyyah,  and  Qadiriyyah.  Most  live  in  the 
North,  East,  West,  and  Center,  where  they  constitute  more  than  90  percent 
of  the  population.  Estimates  of  the  Christian  population  range  from  4  to  10 


xxvm 


percent.  Denominations  include  Orthodox  Christians,  Anglicans,  Roman 
Catholics,  Presbyterians,  and  Evangelicals.  About  20  percent  of  the  popu¬ 
lation  are  followers  of  indigenous  African  religions  who  live  largely  in  the 
South.  Common  precepts  are  belief  in  a  high  spirit  or  divinity,  spirits  as 
forces  in  nature,  and  veneration  of  ancestors.  Islamic  Law  (sharia)  applies 
in  the  North  but  not  in  the  South. 

Education:  In  the  early  1990s,  the  al-Bashir  regime  significantly  reorga¬ 
nized  primary  and  secondary  education.  The  education  ladder  thereafter 
consisted  of  two  years  of  preschool,  eight  years  of  basic  (primary)  educa¬ 
tion,  and  three  years  of  secondary  instruction.  The  curriculum  became 
strongly  Islamist,  and  Arabic  became  the  primary  language  of  instruction. 
This  system  was  modified  by  the  2005  peace  agreement  to  allow  separate 
education  systems  in  North  and  South.  Today  Arabic  continues  as  the 
language  of  instruction  in  the  North;  in  the  South,  English  and  indigenous 
languages  are  used.  In  2009-10,  6.3  million  pupils  were  enrolled  in  basic 
education  and  761,200  in  secondary;  513,000  students  were  attending 
public  and  private  universities.  As  in  the  past,  Northerners  continued  to 
have  greater  access  to  education  than  Southerners.  In  2009  adult  literacy 
was  estimated  at  69  percent  for  the  country  as  a  whole;  as  of  2011,  the 
Southern  government  reported  that  27  percent  of  its  citizens  were  literate. 

Health:  In  the  early  2000s,  available  health  care  was  far  below  what  was 
needed.  There  was  a  great  disparity  in  health  care  between  urban  areas 
and  the  countryside  and  between  North  and  South.  In  the  North,  the  best 
care  was  available  in  Khartoum,  with  at  best  adequate  facilities  in  other 
urban  areas,  and  little  or  none  in  rural  regions.  Facilities  in  the  South  were 
mostly  destroyed  during  the  civil  war  and  were  being  rebuilt  in  the  post- 
2005  era.  Not  surprisingly,  access  to  health  care  was  far  more  restricted  in 
the  South  than  even  in  the  North.  Malnutrition  was  widespread,  and  rates 
of  infant  and  maternal  mortality  were  among  the  highest  in  the  world, 
especially  in  the  South.  Diseases  include  malaria,  perhaps  the  major 
scourge,  tuberculosis,  typhoid,  measles,  schistosomiasis,  and,  additionally 
in  the  South,  river  blindness,  cholera,  guinea  worm,  and  sleeping  sick¬ 
ness.  The  UN  estimated  HIV/AIDS  prevalence  among  adults  in  2013  at 
0.2  percent  to  0.3  percent  in  Sudan,  2.2  percent  in  South  Sudan. 

Economy 

Salient  Features:  Information  on  Sudan’s  economy  is  spotty  or  nonexis¬ 
tent  and  often  lags  by  years.  Sudan  has  natural  and  human  resources,  but 
even  so,  it  remains  a  poor  country.  The  economy  is  based  on  agriculture, 
although  the  export  of  oil  since  1999  has  led  to  a  large  increase  in  national 
income.  A  limited  transport  network,  a  lack  of  foreign  investment,  and 


xxix 


long  wars  in  the  South  and  in  Darfur  are  among  important  constraints  on 
economic  performance.  Dependence  on  imports  of  capital  equipment,  low 
export  earnings,  and  imports  of  petroleum  before  1999  led  to  high  foreign 
debt,  a  continuing  problem.  Since  the  early  1990s,  the  government  has 
promoted  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises  as  one  way  to  stimulate 
the  economy,  with  mixed  results.  Foreign  investment  has  risen  in  parallel 
with  privatization  but  was  hampered  by  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF)  restrictions  in  the  1990s  and  by  ongoing  U.S.  sanctions.  Since  1997 
Sudan  has  implemented  a  structural  adjustment  program  in  cooperation 
with  the  IMF.  The  program  has  helped  stabilize  the  economy  and  promote 
economic  expansion,  aided  by  exports  of  oil.  South  Sudan  receives  virtu¬ 
ally  all  of  its  revenue  from  the  export  of  its  oil.  The  informal  sector  consti¬ 
tutes  a  large  part  of  the  overall  economy  in  Sudan  and  South  Sudan. 

Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP):  In  2013  the  World  Bank  reported 
Sudan’s  GDP  as  US$66.55  billion,  and  South  Sudan’s  GDP  as  US$13.80 
billion.  Sudan's  GDP  grew  at  a  rate  of  at  least  6  percent  a  year  beginning 
in  the  late  1990s,  rising  to  more  than  1 1  percent  in  2006  but  declining  to 
4.21  percent  in  2009,  when  GDP  totaled  an  estimated  US$54.2  billion. 
Its  main  components  were  agricultural  products,  mining  and  petroleum, 
and  services. 

Agriculture:  Agriculture  and  livestock  raising  were  the  main  sources  of 
livelihood  for  an  estimated  80  percent  of  Sudan’s  population  in  the  early 
2000s.  Agricultural  products  accounted  for  upwards  of  95  percent  of 
exports  until  oil  exports  came  on  line  in  1999.  Of  an  estimated  84  million 
hectares  of  arable  land,  the  area  under  permanent  cultivation  was  esti¬ 
mated  at  16  to  17  million  hectares  as  of  2002.  Agriculture  consists  of  a 
modem  market-oriented  sector  of  irrigated  and  mechanized  rain-fed 
farming  concentrated  in  the  central  part  of  the  country  and  a  traditional 
sector  engaged  in  subsistence  activities  elsewhere,  where  water  resources 
permit  cultivation.  Principal  modem-sector  crops  are  cotton,  peanuts, 
sesame,  sorghum,  sugarcane,  and  wheat;  subsistence  cultivators  produce 
mostly  sorghum  and  millet,  and  also  peanuts  and  sesame.  Livestock  pro¬ 
vides  a  large  part  of  the  livelihood  of  nearly  half  of  the  population,  and 
among  pastoralists  and  nomads,  cattle  and  camels  are  the  measure  of  sta¬ 
tus  and  wealth.  Sales  of  livestock — cattle,  sheep,  goats,  and  camels — 
have  become  the  fastest  growing  export  sector  after  oil.  The  area  of  forest 
in  Sudan  has  declined  sharply  since  1990  because  of  overgrazing,  mech¬ 
anized  farming,  and  desertification.  South  Sudan  has  potential  for  a  for¬ 
est-products  industry.

Manufacturing:  Large-scale  manufacturing  is  dominated  by  publicly 
owned  enterprises.  Sugar  and  textiles  were  the  main  products  before 
expansion  of  the  oil  sector.  Petroleum  exports  in  the  late  1990s  provided 
funds  for  investment  and  import  of  equipment.  Telecommunications  and 
the  growing  and  processing  of  sugar  greatly  benefited  from  this  invest¬ 
ment,  but  textile  production  has  remained  far  below  capacity.  The  GIAD 
industrial  city,  established  in  2000,  consists  mostly  of  armaments  and 
automotive  industries.  Elsewhere,  small-scale  enterprises  produce  phar¬ 
maceuticals,  cement,  electrical  goods,  paints,  and  textiles.  South  Sudan 
has  little  if  any  manufacturing  capacity. 

Minerals:  Significant  minerals  that  are  being  mined  include  gold, 
extracted  in  the  Red  Sea  Hills  and  Nubia  since  Pharaonic  times  and  since 
2012  in  North  Darfur;  gypsum,  also  in  the  Red  Sea  Hills;  and  chrome  in 
the  Ingessana  Hills.  Asbestos,  limestone,  marble,  manganese,  mica,  iron 
ore,  and  uranium  ores  are  among  other  minerals  present  in  the  country. 

Petroleum:  Oil  was  first  discovered  in  the  late  1970s.  Most  extraction 
and  reserves  are  in  the  South,  but  exploration  is  currently  underway  in  the 
North.  Further  exploration  and  drilling  were  hampered  and/or  suspended 
by  civil  war  and  by  lack  of  infrastructure  to  transport  and  process  petro¬ 
leum.  Production  resumed  in  the  late  1990s  and  was  followed  by  con¬ 
struction  of  two  export  pipelines  and  terminals  on  the  Red  Sea.  Consortia 
formed  by  foreign  oil  companies  played  a  large  role  in  these  develop¬ 
ments.  Proven  reserves  are  5  billion  barrels  of  oil  and  3  trillion  cubic  feet 
of  natural  gas.  Oil  extraction  in  2009  averaged  ca.  490,000  barrels/day;  in 
the  first  half  of  2014,  production  averaged  260,000  barrels  per  day, 
150,000  from  South  Sudan  and  110,000  from  Sudan.  Gas  production  is 
foreseen  in  the  future.  Major  refineries  are  Al-Jayli  near  Khartoum  and 
another  at  Port  Sudan  with  a  joint  capacity  of  ca.  170,000  barrels/day. 
Under  the  2005  peace  agreement,  oil  revenues  were  split  between  North 
and  South.  A  dispute  over  transit  fees  in  2012  contributed  to  a  decline  in 
production. 

Energy:  In  the  early  2000s,  Sudan’s  chief  sources  of  energy  were  wood, 
charcoal,  hydroelectric  power,  and  oil.  Expanded  use  of  charcoal  and 
wood  for  fuel  as  the  population  has  grown  has  contributed  to  deforesta¬ 
tion  and  desertification.  Sudan  depends  heavily  on  hydropower  from 
dams  on  the  Nile  and  its  tributaries  for  electricity  production;  in  2006, 
hydropower  supplied  41  percent  of  the  country’s  needs.  Steady  expan¬ 
sion  since  then,  especially  of  the  300-megawatt  Kajbar  Dam  and  the 
1 ,250-megawatt  Merowe  Dam,  both  on  the  northern  Nile,  has  led  to  a 
doubling  of  generating  capacity.  There  are  no  hydropower  dams  in  South 
Sudan.

Imports:  In  2013  Sudan’s  imports  amounted  to  US$9.9  billion.  In  2008 
Sudan’s  import  bill  came  to  US$8.9  billion,  largely  machinery,  transport 
equipment,  and  capital  goods.  The  largest  suppliers  were  China,  Saudi 
Arabia,  India,  and  Egypt. 

Exports:  In  2013  Sudan’s  exports  were  US$7.0  billion.  In  2008  exports 
amounted  to  US$12.4  billion,  US$11.6  billion  of  it  crude  oil  or  petro¬ 
leum-based  products  destined  for  China  and  Japan.  Since  2000  such 
products  have  contributed  80  to  90  percent  or  more  of  export  revenue,  far 
surpassing  the  value  of  agricultural  exports  that  formerly  constituted  the 
whole  of  Sudan’s  exports. 

External  Debt:  Sudan’s  foreign  debt  stood  at  US$42  billion  in  June 
2012  according  to  the  government.  South  Sudan’s  debt  reportedly  stood 
at  SSP7.8  billion  (US$2.5  billion)  in  July  2014.  Sudan  has  carried  a  large 
foreign  debt  for  decades.  At  the  time  of  separation  in  July  2011,  total  for¬ 
eign  debt  was  about  US$38  billion;  North  and  South  have  not  yet  negoti¬ 
ated  the  portion  allotted  to  each. 

Budget:  Sudan’s  2014  budget  was  projected  at  approximately  SDG51.1 
billion  (US$9.0  billion).  In  2014,  South  Sudan’s  government  budget  was 
ca.  US$5.6  billion,  much  of  it  devoted  to  salaries  and  security. 

Currency  and  Exchange  Rate:  Sudan’s  unit  of  currency  is  the  Sudanese 
pound,  SDG,  divided  into  100  piasters.  This  (new)  pound,  introduced  in 
January  2007,  replaced  the  Sudanese  dinar  and  the  old  Sudanese  pound. 
On  September  1,  2014,  the  exchange  rate  was  about  SDG5.68=US$1.00. 
South  Sudan’s  currency  is  the  South  Sudanese  pound,  SSP.  On  June  1, 
2014,  the  exchange  rate  was  SSP3.1=$US1.00 

Transportation 

Roads:  Estimates  of  the  road  network  in  the  early  2000s  ranged  upwards 
of  50,000  kilometers,  of  which  3,600  kilometers  were  paved.  Gravel 
roads  accounted  for  ca.  3,700  kilometers,  and  there  were  an  estimated 
45,000  kilometers  of  mainly  seasonal  earth  road  and  sand  tracks. 

Railroads:  The  government-owned  Sudan  Railways  Corporation  oper¬ 
ates  4,578  kilometers  of  1.07-gauge  single  track  connecting  most  of  the 
country  s  production  and  consumption  centers.  The  main  line  runs  from 
Wadi  Haifa  and  Port  Sudan  in  the  north  via  Khartoum  to  Al-Obeid  and 
Nyala  in  the  center  and  west  and  to  Wau  in  the  southwest,  with  short 
extensions  to  Sinnar  and  Kuraymah.  An  eastern  segment  connects  Kassala 
and  Al-Damazin  with  Sinnir,  and  a  spur  runs  from  Sinnar  to  al-Gadaref.  A 


XXXll 


7 1 6-kilometer  light  rail  system  serves  the  Gezira  agricultural  area  south¬ 
east  of  Khartoum.  Rehabilitation  was  underway  on  the  lines  to  Wadi  Haifa 
and  Port  Sudan.  Service  on  the  Wau  line  has  been  restored  after  closure 
during  the  civil  war. 

Inland  Waterways:  Sudan  has  4,068  kilometers  of  navigable  rivers,  but 
only  1,723  kilometers  are  open  throughout  the  year.  The  backbone  of  the 
system  is  formed  by  the  White  Nile,  Blue  Nile,  and  Nile  River.  Cataracts, 
shallows,  a  growing  number  of  dams,  and  seasonal  variation  in  water  lev¬ 
els  limit  river  traffic.  River  transport,  which  dwindled  after  the  mid-1980s 
when  navigation  south  of  Kosti  became  impossible  because  of  attacks  by 
the  SPLA,  has  not  recovered. 

Pipelines:  Sudan  has  two  major  pipelines  that  carry  oil  from  the  South¬ 
ern  oil  fields  to  the  Red  Sea  for  export.  A  1,610-kilometer  line  mns  from 
the  Bashayir  terminal  near  Port  Sudan  to  the  Bentiu  fields  in  Unity  State 
via  Khartoum  and  the  Al-Jayli  refinery.  The  second  line  is  1,500  kilome¬ 
ters  long  and  runs  from  Port  Sudan  to  the  Melut  Basin  in  Upper  Nile 
State.  Extensions  connect  outlying  fields  to  the  major  lines.  Capacity 
exceeds  1  million  barrels  per  day,  but  refining  capacity  and  other  factors 
have  constrained  this  potential. 

Civil  Aviation:  Sudan  Airways  provides  domestic  service  from  Khar¬ 
toum  to  1 5  domestic  airports  and  international  service  from  three  airports 
to  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  Juba  international  airport  has  flights  to 
Khartoum  and  to  capitals  of  neighboring  countries. 

Marine  Ports  and  Shipping:  Port  Sudan  and  Sawakin  on  the  Red  Sea 
are  the  major  commercial  ports;  the  port  of  Bashayir  handles  most  oil 
exports.  The  national  merchant  marine  had  19  vessels  in  the  early  2000s 
that  sailed  mainly  between  the  Red  Sea  ports  in  the  Mediterranean  and 
Europe. 

Telecommunications:  Sudan’s  telecommunications  network  has  greatly 
expanded  in  recent  years,  albeit  from  a  very  low  base.  In  2008  there  were 
only  356,000  landlines,  fewer  than  five  lines  per  1,000  residents,  and  1 1 .2 
million  mobile-phone  subscriptions,  but  large  parts  of  the  country  were 
not  covered  by  mobile-phone  networks.  Internet  users  numbered  4.2  mil¬ 
lion;  cyber  cafes  in  larger  towns  and  cities  provided  most  Internet  service.

Government  and  Politics 


Political  System:  Since  independence  in  1956,  Sudan  has  gravitated 
between  civilian  and  military  government.  The  latest  turnover  came  in 
1989,  when  Lieutenant  Colonel  Umar  al-Bashir  led  a  coup  that  overthrew 
the  democratically  elected  government  of  Sadiq  al-Mahdi.  Since  then, 
Sudan,  although  officially  a  republic  with  a  constitution  and  governing 
authority  divided  among  executive,  legislative,  and  judicial  branches,  has 
functioned  as  a  highly  centralized  political  system  with  real  power  and 
authority  exercised  by  the  office  of  the  presidency  under  al-Bashir.  The 
government  is  dominated  by  the  National  Congress  Party  (NCP)  headed 
by  al-Bashir.  Sudan  has  traditionally  been  governed  by  Arabs  of  the  cen¬ 
tral  Nile  who  neglected  peripheral  regions,  giving  rise  in  the  post-inde¬ 
pendence  era  to  separatist  movements  in  the  South,  East,  and  West 
(Darfur).  Corruption  in  government  at  all  levels  is  an  ongoing  problem. 

From  2005  to  2011,  Sudan  was  governed  according  to  provisions  of  the 
Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  (CPA)  of  2005,  which  ended  more 
than  two  decades  of  civil  war  between  Northern  and  Southern  Sudan. 
The  CPA  created  the  Government  of  National  Unity  in  Khartoum  and  an 
autonomous  government  for  Southern  Sudan  in  Juba  with  its  own  execu¬ 
tive,  legislative,  and  judicial  institutions.  Southerners  took  up  seats  in  the 
cabinet  and  the  national  legislature.  The  CPA  also  provided  that  after  six 
years  Southern  Sudanese  would  vote  to  remain  part  of  Sudan  or  opt  for 
independence.  In  a  referendum  in  January  2011,  98.8  percent  of  South¬ 
erners  who  voted  chose  independence  from  the  North.  The  separation 
became  official  on  July  9, 201 1 .  Since  then,  Sudan  and  South  Sudan  have 
been  governed  by  interim  constitutions. 

Executive  Branch:  In  Sudan,  the  executive  consists  of  a  president 
who  is  head  of  state  and  head  of  government.  He  wields  wide-ranging 
powers  over  domestic  and  foreign  policies  and  is  commander  in  chief 
of  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces.  He  is  directly  elected  by  the  people  of 
Sudan  to  a  five-year  term.  Al-Bashir  has  held  this  office  continuously 
since  1993,  including  during  the  CPA  era.  He  was  last  elected  in  2010. 
There  are  also  two  vice  presidents  and  a  council  of  ministers  appointed 
by  the  president. 

In  South  Sudan,  the  executive  consists  of  a  president,  a  vice  president, 
and  a  council  of  ministers.  The  president  is  head  of  state,  head  of  govern¬ 
ment,  and  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces,  the  Sudan  People’s 
Liberation  Army  (SPLA).  His  position  and  powers  mirror  those  of 
Sudan’s  presidency.  He  selects  the  vice  president  but  must  appoint  the 
council  of  ministers  with  the  consent  of  the  national  legislature.  Since 


xxxiv 


2005  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  has  been  South  Sudan's  president,  having  been 
last  elected  to  a  five-year  term  in  2010.  He  was  first  vice  president  during 
the  CPA-era  Government  of  National  Unity  in  Khartoum. 

Legislative  Branch:  Sudan  has  a  bicameral  legislature  consisting  of  the 
National  Assembly  and  the  Council  of  States.  South  Sudan's  legislature 
also  has  a  National  Assembly  and  a  Council  of  States.  At  present,  each 
legislature  consists  of  members  elected  to  five-year  terms  plus  those 
nominated  to  fill  vacancies  after  the  National  Unity  Government  dis¬ 
solved  in  201 1 .  The  2010  elections  gave  the  NCP  a  majority  in  Khartoum 
and  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement  (SPLM)  a  majority  in 
Juba. 

Judicial  Branch:  The  CPA's  Interim  National  Constitution  established  a 
system  of  national  courts,  which  Sudan  has  essentially  preserved.  The 
Supreme  Court  is  the  highest  court  in  the  land.  It  consists  of  70  judges 
and  has  jurisdiction  in  civil  and  criminal  matters.  A  Constitutional  Court 
of  nine  judges  handles  issues  relating  to  constitutional  law  as  well  as 
cases  of  human  rights.  Courts  of  appeal  hear  cases  from  lower  courts 
involving  customary  law,  among  other  matters.  The  2011  transitional 
constitution  in  the  South  also  established  a  Supreme  Court  and  courts  of 
appeal.  Because  of  a  lack  of  trained  personnel,  customary  courts  adjudi¬ 
cated  most  legal  proceedings.  For  much  of  Sudan's  independence  era, 
executive  interference  injudicial  proceedings  has  been  common,  particu¬ 
larly  by  military  governments;  it  is  also  common  in  South  Sudan. 

Administrative  Divisions:  Sudan  is  divided  into  15  states,  South  Sudan 
into  10.  Each  state  has  a  governor  and  a  council  of  ministers  as  well  as  its 
own  legislative  and  judicial  organs.  Each  is  subdivided  into  smaller 
administrative  units;  those  in  the  South  include  payams  (districts)  and 
bomas  (villages).  Governors,  formerly  appointed,  were  all  elected  in  the 
2010  elections.  The  administration  of  the  oil-rich  and  contested  area  of 
Abyei  on  the  border  between  North  and  South  was  still  being  negotiated 
as  of  20 14. 

Legal  System:  Sudan’s  judiciary  was  based  on  British  laws  and  courts 
during  the  colonial  period.  Beginning  in  the  1980s,  Islamic  law  (sharia) 
was  implemented  to  one  degree  or  another  by  successive  governments, 
giving  rise  to  much  controversy  among  Muslims  and  non-Muslims  alike. 
After  1991  sharia  was  in  force  in  Sudan  in  keeping  with  the  Islamist 
agenda  of  the  National  Islamic  Front,  which  became  the  NCP.  The  1998 
constitution  established  sharia  as  one  of  several  bases  of  Sudanese  law. 
The  legal  system  today  is  a  mixture  of  sharia  and  English  law.  In  the 


xxxv 


South,  customary  law  applies  below  the  state  level,  and  most  litigation 
occurs  in  customary  courts.  Religious  freedom  is  generally  respected. 

Electoral  System:  National  elections  were  held  in  1996  and  2000.  In 
both  cases,  al-Bashir  was  elected  president  in  elections  that  major  opposi¬ 
tion  parties  boycotted.  National  elections  were  next  held  in  April  2010 
under  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement.  Al-Bashir  was 
again  elected  after  his  two  main  opponents  withdrew  at  the  last  minute, 
and  Salva  Kiir  was  overwhelmingly  elected  to  the  presidency  of  South 
Sudan,  both  to  five-year  terms.  The  voting  age  in  Sudan  is  1 7  years  and 
older;  it  is  18  years  and  older  in  South  Sudan. 

Political  Parties:  All  political  parties  were  banned  after  the  1989  coup 
until  1999.  Sudan  has  a  large  number  of  parties  or  political  groups,  which 
are  regulated  by  the  Political  Parties  Act  of  2007.  Major  parties  are:  the 
National  Congress  Party  with  al-Bashir  at  its  head;  the  National  Umma 
Party  led  by  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  a  descendant  of  the  nineteenth-century 
Mahdi;  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party  led  by  Muhammad  Uthman  al- 
Mirghani,  based  on  the  Khatmiyyah  religious  order;  the  Popular  Congress 
Party  founded  in  2000  by  Hassan  Abdullah  al-Turabi;  the  Sudanese  Com¬ 
munist  Party  led  by  Muhammad  Mukhtar  Al-Khatib;  and  the  Reform 
Now  Party,  led  by  Ghazi  Salah  al-Din  Atabani.  Other  important  political 
groups  are  the  Sudan  Liberation  Movement/ Army  and  the  Justice  and 
Equality  Movement,  both  Darfuri  groups;  the  Beja  Congress  and  the  Free 
Lions  who  are  joined  in  the  Eastern  Front;  the  SPLM-N  (North),  the 
Northern  remnant  of  the  southern  SPLM;  the  National  Consensus  Forces; 
and  the  Sudanese  Revolutionary  Front.  In  South  Sudan,  the  Sudanese 
People's  Liberation  Movement  (SPLM)  is  the  dominant  political  party, 
with  Salva  Kiir  at  its  head.  There  are  a  number  of  smaller  regionally  based 
political  parties  or  groups. 

Foreign  Relations:  Sudan  considers  itself  part  of  the  African  and  Arab 
worlds.  It  has  a  special  interest  in  all  of  its  nine  neighbors,  particularly  in 
Egypt,  where  relations  date  to  antiquity,  but  also  in  Ethiopia  and  Uganda, 
headwaters  of  the  Nile  and  its  tributaries.  Sudan’s  Islamist  agenda  largely 
determined  the  nature  (friendly  or  otherwise)  of  relations  with  Arab  and 
neighboring  states  during  the  1990s.  These  relations  generally  improved 
with  the  decline  of  Sudan’s  Islamist  militancy  in  the  2000s.  Sudan  and 
Egypt  have  drawn  much  closer  since  the  later  1990s,  adopting  a  common 
position  in  discussions  with  their  African  neighbors  about  sharing  the 
Nile's  water  even  as  they  remain  divided  over  administration  of  the 
Hala’ib  Triangle  on  their  border.  Relations  with  Chad  also  warmed  after 
long  years  when  both  countries  sponsored  insurgent  movements  in  each 
other's  territory.

Sudan’s  perceived  support  for  international  terrorism  has  affected  its 
relations  with  Western  countries  since  the  1990s,  especially  the  United 
States,  although  the  conflicts  in  the  South  and  in  Darfur  have  also  loomed 
large.  The  United  States  accused  Sudan  of  playing  a  role  in  the  bombing 
of  the  U.S.  embassies  in  Nairobi  and  Dar  es  Salaam  in  1998,  acts  that  led 
the  United  States  to  bomb  the  Al-Shifa  pharmaceutical  plant  in  Khar¬ 
toum.  Although  Sudan  has  since  cooperated  with  the  United  States  on 
international  terrorism,  the  country  remains  on  the  U.S.  list  of  state  spon¬ 
sors  of  terrorism;  Sudan  is  also  subject  to  U.S.  economic  sanctions 
because  of  wars  in  Darfur  and  the  South. 

South  Sudan  belongs  to  the  United  Nations,  the  African  Union,  the  Com¬ 
mon  Market  for  Eastern  and  Southern  Africa,  and  the  Intergovernmental 
Authority  on  Development.  It  has  especially  close  relations  with  Uganda 
and  the  United  States,  the  United  States  having  nurtured  its  independence 
movement  and  provided  large  amounts  of  economic  aid  since  2011. 

National  Security 

Armed  Forces  Overview:  In  2013  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces  (SAF)  con¬ 
sisted  of  a  large  army,  a  small  air  force  with  modem  fighter  and  transport 
aircraft,  a  small  navy,  and  paramilitary  forces.  The  armed  forces  have 
faced  problems  of  morale  and  poorly  maintained  equipment  in  the  past, 
but  since  the  late  1990s  oil  revenues  have  enabled  Sudan  to  finance 
imports  of  modem  weaponry,  much  of  it  from  China,  Egypt,  Iran,  and 
Russia.  Beginning  in  the  late  1990s,  Sudan  began  to  manufacture  mili¬ 
tary  equipment  of  its  own,  including  light  tanks,  light  and  heavy  artillery, 
machine  guns,  and  armored  personnel  carriers.  Security  concerns  are 
unresolved  border  issues  with  South  Sudan  and  ongoing  insurgencies  in 
Darfur  and  in  South  Kordofan  and  Blue  Nile  States. 

In  the  South,  the  government  faced  the  task  of  molding  the  armed  groups 
and  militias  that  compose  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Army  (SPLA) 
into  a  conventional  army.  The  fighting  that  began  in  late  2013  between 
Dinka  and  Nuer  components  of  the  SPLA  showed  the  difficulty  of  this 
task.  The  SPLA  is  composed  overwhelmingly  of  infantry,  the  South  hav¬ 
ing  only  a  few  light  aircraft  and  no  navy.  The  South's  security  concerns 
are  the  North  and  insurgencies  in  the  East  and  West. 

Sudan:  SAF  Military  Units:  The  Sudanese  army  was  estimated  at 
240,000  in  2013.  It  is  largely  a  light  infantry  force  of  more  than  20  divi¬ 
sions  supported  by  specialized  units;  among  these  are  armored,  engineer¬ 
ing,  and  mechanized  divisions,  special-forces  companies,  and  a  border- 
security  brigade.  Its  equipment  includes  several  hundred  heavy  and  light 


XXXVll 


tanks,  reconnaissance  vehicles,  heavy  artillery,  armored  personnel  carri¬ 
ers,  and  air-defense  guns  and  missiles,  the  latter  of  uncertain  serviceabil¬ 
ity.  The  navy,  with  an  estimated  1,300  personnel,  had  barely  a  dozen 
serviceable  craft  to  patrol  coastal  and  river  traffic.  Naval  commands  were 
located  at  Port  Sudan  and  Khartoum.  The  3,000-member  air  force  was 
based  mainly  in  the  Khartoum  area.  It  had  more  than  60  combat  aircraft, 
including  MiG-29SE  and  MiG-29UB  Fulcrums,  A-5  Fantans,  and  Su-25 
Frogfoots.  Among  other  craft  were  helicopters  (Mi-24/35  Hinds  and  Mi- 
171s)  and  C-130H  Hercules  transports.  The  missiles  of  the  air-defense 
system  were  most  likely  obsolete.  The  air  force,  like  the  army,  has  in  the 
past  suffered  from  lack  of  maintenance  of  its  equipment. 

South  Sudan:  SPLA  Military  Units:  In  2013  SPFA  ground  forces 
numbered  an  estimated  210,000,  divided  into  nine  infantry  divisions. 
Main  equipment  included  more  than  100  tanks,  T-55s  and  T-72s;  support 
artillery,  consisting  of  self-propelled  guns,  multiple  rocket  launchers,  and 
mortars;  and  air-defense  guns.  The  SPFA  had  no  air  force  per  se,  no 
fighter  aircraft,  and  only  a  small  number  of  helicopters  and  transport  craft. 

Defense  Budget:  Sudan’s  defense  expenditures  in  2013  were  estimated 
at  US$1.52  billion.  In  2013  South  Sudan’s  defense  budget  was  about 
US$714  million. 

Military  Service:  In  Sudan,  men  and  women  aged  18-30  are  subject  to 
compulsory  military  service  for  a  period  of  two  years.  In  South  Sudan, 
males  18  years  and  older  are  eligible  to  join  the  SPFA,  although  the  age 
requirement  appears  not  to  be  strictly  enforced.  Women  are  also  eligible 
to  serve  in  the  South  Sudanese  military. 

Paramilitary  Forces:  Since  the  early  1990s,  Sudan  has  had  both  para¬ 
militaries  and  irregular  fighters  organized  into  militias.  The  People’s 
Defense  Force,  the  major  government-sponsored  paramilitary,  was  cre¬ 
ated  in  1989  to  fight  against  the  SPFA.  In  2013  it  consisted  of  an  esti¬ 
mated  20,000  active-duty  personnel  and  85,000  reservists.  The  janjaweed 
are  the  most  famous  and  notorious  of  the  militias.  They  were  originally 
Arab  cattle-herders  armed  by  the  government  to  fight  against  rebels  in 
Darfur  beginning  in  2003.  Other  Arab  militias  armed  by  the  government, 
variously  called  murahalin ,  have  fought  in  Darfur  and  South  Kordofan. 
During  the  civil  war,  the  government  armed  several  militias  in  Southern 
Sudan  to  fight  against  the  SPFA.  South  Sudan  was  not  reported  to  have 
paramilitary  forces  similar  to  those  in  the  North,  although  ethnically 
based  militias  operate  in  several  states.

Police:  Sudan's  police  functions  are  divided  among  several  organizations. 
The  United  Police  Forces  number  about  30,000  and  are  responsible  for  a 
wide  range  of  duties,  including  civil  defense,  criminal  investigations, 
immigration  and  customs,  and  traffic  control.  The  Popular  Police  Forces, 
with  an  estimated  35,000  members,  operate  as  a  politicized  militia  that 
enforces  religious  strictures  among  the  Muslim  population.  The  Popular 
Defense  Forces  consist  of  auxiliaries  who  ostensibly  relieve  the  Sudan 
Armed  Forces  of  local  defense  duties.  A  Border  Intelligence  Guard  pro¬ 
vides  intelligence  to  the  armed  forces. 

The  South  Sudan  Police  Service  was  created  following  the  signing  of  the 
CPA  in  2005.  Since  then  it  has  been  undergoing  restructuring  and  train¬ 
ing  by  UN  agencies,  including  the  UN  Mission  in  South  Sudan. 

Human  Rights:  The  Sudanese  government  in  general  has  a  poor  human- 
rights  record.  International  human-rights  organizations  regularly  reported 
restrictions  on  free  speech,  assembly,  and  the  press;  arbitrary  arrest  and 
detention;  denial  of  due  process  in  the  courts;  beating,  rape,  torture,  and 
extrajudicial  killing  by  security  forces;  and  cruel  and  inhumane  treatment 
or  punishment.  Prison  conditions  are  harsh,  especially  with  regard  to  food 
and  health.  Sudanese  government  armed  forces  committed  massive 
human-rights  violations  in  Darfur  after  2003  and  in  South  Kordofan  and 
Blue  Nile  States  beginning  in  2011,  but  rebel  forces  in  those  states  also 
engaged  in  human-rights  abuses.  In  South  Sudan,  international  organiza¬ 
tions  have  reported  human-rights  violations  by  the  SPLM,  SPLA,  and 
militias  similar  to  those  in  the  North.  Most  recently,  government  and  anti- 
government  armed  forces  committed  large-scale  ethnically  based  massa¬ 
cres  and  displacement  of  civilians  in  the  civil  war  that  began  in  mid- 
December  2013.

Introduction 


IN  MID-2011  THE  MAJOR  QUESTION  about  the  unified  nation-state 
of  Sudan  was:  Whither  the  “Two  Sudans?”  Before  the  January  2011  ref¬ 
erendum  in  the  South  of  Sudan,  in  which  Southerners  voted  for  indepen¬ 
dence,  the  question  had  been  whether  Sudan  would  continue  as  one 
unitary  state  or  would  divide  into  two  independent,  separate  entities.  This 
earlier  question  had  preoccupied  Sudan  for  six  years,  following  the 
cease-fire  between  the  North  and  the  South  and  the  signing  of  the  Com¬ 
prehensive  Peace  Agreement  (CPA)  in  January  2005,  which  ended  more 
than  two  decades  of  civil  war. 

From  its  outset,  the  CPA  foresaw  two  possible  outcomes  for  the  future 
of  Sudan:  continued  unity  or  separation  and  independence  for  the  South. 
To  allow  for  each  of  these  possibilities,  the  CPA  provided  inter  alia  for  a 
unitary  national  government  composed  of  officials  from  both  the  North 
and  the  South  and  the  sharing  of  revenues  from  export  of  the  country’s  oil, 
located  almost  entirely  in  the  South.  It  did  not,  however,  provide  for 
immediate  merging  of  the  military  forces,  nor  did  it  provide  for  economic 
development  of  the  South  beyond  the  sharing  of  the  income  from  oil. 
Whatever  the  strengths  or  weaknesses  of  the  CPA,  and  there  were  both, 
the  course  of  events  during  the  period  of  the  CPA — 2005  to  2011 — rein¬ 
forced  the  long-term  alienation  of  Southern  Sudanese  from  their  Northern 
counterparts  to  the  extent  that  the  option  of  unity  lost  whatever  traction  in 
may  ever  have  had,  leaving  the  option  of  separation  as  the  only  viable 
alternative.  As  a  consequence,  the  question  of  the  continued  unity  of  the 
Sudanese  state  was  answered  in  January  2011,  when  more  than  98  percent 
of  voters  in  the  referendum  opted  for  independence  from  Sudan.  Hence¬ 
forth,  two  states  appeared  on  the  African  map  where  heretofore  there  had 
been  only  one:  the  Republic  of  Sudan  (the  North),  and  the  Republic  of 
South  Sudan  (the  South). 

To  long-term  observers  of  Sudan,  the  outcome  of  the  referendum  was 
hardly  a  surprise.  They  had  long  identified  several  major  problems  that 
plagued  the  Sudanese  state  and  that  hindered  its  unity,  among  them  gov¬ 
ernance,  the  diversity  of  Sudan’s  peoples,  and  the  concentration  of  deci¬ 
sion-making  in  Khartoum  at  the  expense  of  outlying  peoples  and  regions. 

As  a  unitary  state,  Sudan  contained  a  wide  diversity  of  peoples  spread 
across  the  enormous  expanse  of  its  2.5  million  square  kilometers.  These 
peoples  have  different  cultures,  religions,  and  physical  features.  Number¬ 
ing  more  than  40  million  in  2014,  they  are  divided  into  some  600  ethnic 
groups  or  tribes  and  speak  more  than  400  languages.  Broadly  speaking, 


xli 


they  are  divided  between  the  Muslim  Arabs  of  the  North  and  the  Christian 
and  animist  Africans  of  the  South.  Governing  such  diversity  would  pose  a 
major  task  under  the  best  of  circumstances — a  state  of  being  that  Sudan 
can  hardly  be  said  to  have  enjoyed  in  recent  decades,  if  ever.  Since  inde¬ 
pendence  from  Britain  in  1956,  Sudan  has  witnessed  alternating  periods 
of  civilian  and  military  rule,  accompanied  by  incipient  or  full-scale  civil 
war  except  for  the  years  1972-83.  The  latest  phase  in  this  cycle  began  in 
1989  with  the  arrival  of  an  Islamist  government  with  strong  military  back¬ 
ing  under  President  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al-Bashir  and  the  National 
Congress  Party  (NCP). 

The  northern  part  of  the  country  has  a  long  tradition  of  human  settle¬ 
ment  that  stretches  back  at  least  into  the  Late  Stone  Age.  Later,  the  ancient 
kingdoms  of  Kush  (early  second  millennium  B.C.)  and  Meroe  (sixth  cen¬ 
tury  B.C.)  flourished  on  the  northern  Nile.  Beginning  by  the  eighth  cen¬ 
tury  A.D.,  Arabs  arrived  from  Egypt,  and  with  them  in  due  course  came 
Islam,  which  slowly  spread  in  succeeding  centuries.  The  nineteenth  cen¬ 
tury  brought  the  presence  of  Turks  and  Egyptians,  the  Mahdist  state,  and 
finally,  at  its  end,  British  colonialists.  The  colonial  period  lasted  until  1956 
and  brought,  at  least  to  some  parts  of  the  country,  a  transport  infrastruc¬ 
ture,  minor  development,  education,  and  a  respected  civil  service  and  judi¬ 
ciary.  In  terms  of  the  economy,  geography,  and  government,  it  saw  the 
creation  of  the  modem  nation-state  of  Sudan,  combining  the  Arab-Islamic 
North  with  the  Nilotic  Africans  of  the  South,  the  Beja  groups  of  the  East, 
and  the  Darfuris  of  the  West. 

The  Nilotic  peoples  of  the  South  have  been  in  place  for  centuries  and 
perhaps  much  longer.  They  practice  agriculture  and  pastoralism  and  live 
for  the  most  part  in  stateless  societies,  although  there  are  exceptions,  such 
as  the  Shilluk.  Their  relations  with  Northerners  in  the  more  recent  past  can 
best  be  described  as  troubled,  arising  largely  from  experience  with  Arab 
slavers  who  preyed  on  them,  especially  in  the  nineteenth  century.  This 
experience  left  a  legacy  of  fear,  suspicion,  and  general  ill  will  among 
Southerners  with  regard  to  their  Northern  neighbors  that  persisted  through 
the  colonial  period  and  the  years  of  independence  to  the  present.  It  is  the 
legacy  of  slaving,  along  with  perceptions  of  domination  and  neglect,  which 
largely  explains  the  Southerners’  preference  for  independence  in  the  voting 
in  201 1  and  the  course  of  relations  between  North  and  South  since  then. 

Since  at  least  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  the  Arabs  of  the  mid-northern 
Nile  have  been  at  the  center  of  government,  formulating  economic,  mili¬ 
tary,  political,  and  social  policies  for  the  entire  country  but  at  the  same  time 
denying  any  representation  for  peoples  other  than  themselves  in  the  gov¬ 
erning  process.  It  is  this  uninterrupted  concentration  of  political  authority 
and  power  at  the  center  among  a  select  group  of  riverine  Northerners  that 
has  caused  so  many  of  Sudan’s  problems  since  independence,  first  among 


xlii 


Southerners  and  later  among  Darfuris,  Beja,  Nubians,  the  Nuba,  and  oth¬ 
ers.  This  pattern  of  governance  has  persisted  under  President  al-Bashir  and 
his  NCP  since  1989.  Al-Bashir  and  the  NCP  have  championed  an  Islamist 
agenda,  including  the  imposition  of  Islamic  law,  the  sharia,  on  the  country, 
an  agenda  that  has  alienated  many  Sudanese,  regardless  of  religion.  To 
repeat,  it  is  this  concentration  of  resources  in  the  center  that  has  led  to  the 
desire  for  secession  among  peripheral  peoples,  of  whom  the  first  to  secede 
now  inhabit  the  independent  state  of  South  Sudan. 

Aside  from  these  major  factors,  a  number  of  new,  more  immediate 
issues  came  to  the  fore  at  the  time  of  separation  in  July  2011,  resulting 
from  the  need  to  divide  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  former  unified  state. 
Among  these  were  and  in  most  cases  still  are  the  questions  of  citizenship, 
debt-sharing,  division  of  oil  revenues,  the  demarcation  of  the  border,  and 
the  status  of  provinces  along  the  common  border  (see  fig.  2;  fig.  3). 

As  separation  neared,  some  of  the  inhabitants  on  each  side  of  the  new 
border  faced  the  question  of  their  status.  Northerners  in  the  South  tended 
to  be  traders  and  government  officials,  whereas  upwards  of  some  3  mil¬ 
lion  or  more  Southerners  resided  in  the  North,  many  of  them  long-term 
residents  with  little  or  no  connection  or  identity  with  the  South.  It  was 
assumed  that  many  of  these  Southerners  would  return  to  their  families  and 
lands  in  the  South,  and,  indeed,  many  began  the  arduous  journey  to  do  just 
that,  a  process  hastened  by  the  declaration  of  the  al-Bashir  regime  that  the 
North  would  become  a  full-fledged  Islamist  state  governed  by  the  sharia. 
They  returned  to  a  land  many  of  them  did  not  know  and  where  they  faced 
an  uncertain  future  with  regard  to  employment  and  access  to  land.  The 
status  of  Southerners  in  the  North  remained  unsettled,  despite  discussions 
between  Northern  and  Southern  leaders. 

The  question  of  how  to  divide  Sudan’s  external  debt,  some  US$38  bil¬ 
lion  in  201 1,  was  another  issue  that  remained  unsettled  despite  attempts  at 
negotiation  by  both  sides.  A  closely  related  and  highly  contentious  issue 
concerned  oil  and  how  to  share  oil  revenues.  Almost  all  oil  was  found  in  the 
South,  whereas  refineries  and  the  pipelines  that  carried  the  oil  to  Red  Sea 
ports  were  located  in  the  North.  Moreover,  the  economies  of  both  successor 
states  were  highly  dependent  on  the  income  from  oil  exports.  An  agreement 
about  how  to  share  oil  income  and  its  transportation  was  obviously  impera¬ 
tive — but  disagreements  over  pipeline  fees  that  the  South  would  pay  to 
transport  its  oil  and  Southern  charges  that  the  North  was  short-changing  the 
South  in  terms  of  export  income  led  to  a  total  shut-down  of  oil  production 
by  the  South  in  January  2012.  The  standoff  between  the  two  sides  contin¬ 
ued  for  months,  even  as  their  state  budgets  deteriorated  alarmingly. 

One  of  the  most  contentious  issues  concerned  the  status  of  three  border 
regions — Abyei  with  its  oil  fields,  the  Nuba  Mountains  of  South  Kordofan 
State,  and  Blue  Nile  State.  The  CPA  had  provided  for  what  were  termed 


xliii 


Figure  2.  Sudan,  2014 


“popular  consultations,”  presumably  plebiscites,  to  determine  whether  the 
inhabitants  of  each  region  wished  to  join  the  North  or  the  South  after  July 
2011.  The  consultations  were  either  postponed  repeatedly  or,  in  the  case  of 
Blue  Nile,  barely  begun,  however,  and  as  the  CPA  era  came  to  an  end,  the 
final  status  of  these  regions  was  unsettled.  As  predicted,  all  three  became 
flashpoints  between  the  North  and  the  South. 

Beyond  these  three  territories  loomed  the  much  longer-running  con¬ 
flict  in  Darfur  that  began  in  2003  over  charges  of  economic  and  political 
neglect.  The  region  was  well  known  for  violence  and  mayhem  involving 
insurgents  on  the  one  hand  and  government  forces  and  allied  militias  on 
the  other,  some  of  the  latter  the  infamous  janjaweed  (see  Glossary),  or 
armed  raiders.  A  peacekeeping  mission,  the  United  Nations- African 
Union  Mission  in  Darfur,  was  in  place  by  2008,  but  unfortunately  there 
was  little  peace  to  keep.  According  to  a  2013  UN  estimate,  2.3  million 
people  had  been  displaced  by  a  decade  of  conflict  and  insecurity,  driven 


xliv 


Figure  3.  South  Sudan,  2014 

into  camps  or  exile.  After  2009  the  level  of  violence  declined,  but  it  rose 
in  2013  as  the  janjaweed  militias,  by  now  virtually  independent  of  gov¬ 
ernment  control,  and  the  rebels  engaged  in  renewed  raiding  and  at  times 
killing  of  civilians.  A  new  element  was  clashes  among  Arab  militias  in 
North  Darfur  over  control  of  gold  mines.  In  August  2013,  the  al-Bashir 
government  created  a  new  militia,  the  Rapid  Support  Forces,  to  help  the 
Sudan  Armed  Forces  (SAF)  in  its  campaigns  against  rebels  in  Darfur  and 
South  Kordofan.  This  new  militia  fought  with  success,  but  it  earned  a  rep¬ 
utation  for  brutality  against  civilians  in  Darfur. 

Several  ethnic-based  insurgent  groups  are  involved  in  the  conflict  in 
Darfur,  the  major  ones  being  the  Sudan  Liberation  Movement/Army 
(SLM/A),  now  broken  into  two  factions,  and  the  Justice  and  Equality 
Movement  (JEM).  There  have  been  attempts  at  peace  agreements,  notably 
in  Abuja  (2006)  and  Tripoli  (2007).  The  most  recent  effort  is  the  Doha  Doc¬ 
ument  for  Peace  in  Darfur,  signed  in  Doha,  Qatar,  on  July  14,  2011,  by  a 
third  group,  the  Liberation  and  Justice  Movement,  joined  in  April  2013  by  a 


xlv 


JEM  splinter.  These  accords  have  been  signed  by  one  or  another  rebel 
group  but  none  has  been  accepted  by  all.  The  Doha  Document  is  a  frame¬ 
work  agreement  that  addresses  a  number  of  issues  in  the  Darfur  conflict, 
among  them  a  regional  governing  authority,  wealth  sharing,  and  representa¬ 
tion  in  the  national  executive  and  legislature.  Although  backed  by  the  UN 
and  the  African  Union,  the  SLM  and  JEM  have  refused  to  sign  on, 
demanding  more  autonomy  within  the  region  and  a  democratic  and  secular 
national  government,  among  other  objections.  Negotiations  under  the  Doha 
framework  were  underway  in  2014,  even  as  conflict  continued  in  Darfur. 

South  Sudan 

At  independence  on  July  9,  2011,  the  people  and  government  of  the 
new  Republic  of  South  Sudan  faced  the  task  of  constructing  a  new  nation 
almost  literally  from  the  ground  up.  It  was  composed  of  a  congeries  of 
major  and  minor  ethnic  groups,  the  largest  being  the  Dinka  and  the  Nuer, 
with  little  intergroup  cohesion.  Its  political  system  was  mostly  undevel¬ 
oped.  Its  economy  was  largely  infonnal  and  lacking  in  almost  every 
aspect  of  development  in  terms  of  transportation,  telecommunications, 
and  industrial  infrastructure.  It  had  some  of  the  lowest  rates  of  literacy  and 
health-care  delivery  in  the  world,  all  the  result  of  the  near-total  neglect  of 
Southern  Sudan  over  the  last  century  or  more.  The  CPA  era  had  seen 
some  improvement  in  all  of  these  areas,  notably  in  the  creation  of  some 
centralized  state  institutions  and  with  the  inflow  of  oil  revenue  from  the 
National  Unity  Government  in  Khartoum.  Still,  the  task  that  lay  before  the 
people  of  South  Sudan  was  immense. 

The  South  inherited  embryonic  state  institutions  from  the  CPA  era, 
consisting  of  a  presidency,  a  parliament,  and  the  beginnings  of  executive- 
and  judicial-branch  agencies.  Two  of  the  major  tasks  were  the  writing  of  a 
constitution,  a  process  still  underway  in  2014,  and  the  creation  of  a 
national  army  out  of  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Army  (SPLA)  and 
smaller  regionally  based  militias,  some  of  which  had  fought  against  the 
SPLA  during  the  civil  war.  Among  major  problems  were  charges  of  cor¬ 
ruption  and  nepotism  in  the  central  government,  and  a  feeling  of  exclu¬ 
sion  from  participation  in  affairs  of  the  new  state  among  various  ethnic 
groups,  for  example,  in  the  writing  of  the  new  constitution  and  in  access 
to  state  employment. 

The  security  situation  in  the  South  was  also  precarious.  The  present  10 
states  of  the  South  witnessed  much  of  the  warfare  during  the  second  civil 
war  from  1983  to  2005,  some  of  it  involving  rivalries  and  fighting  among 
different  groups  of  Southerners.  The  legacy  of  this  fighting,  and  the  arms 
associated  with  it,  continued  after  independence  in  the  fonn  of  intercom- 
munal  violence  as  well  as  of  skirmishing  along  the  border  with  Sudan  in 
the  north  and  west.  The  most  violent  state  was  Jonglei,  where  fighting

was  ongoing  between  the  Lou  Nuer  and  the  Murle  groups  in  the  months 
preceding  independence.  Between  January  2011  and  September  2012, 
the  UN  recorded  at  least  302  attacks  in  the  province,  resulting  in  2,500 
deaths.  Some  of  the  worst  violence  occurred  in  Pibor  County,  the  Murle 
heartland,  where  the  Lou  Nuer  and  the  Murle  engaged  in  long-standing 
tit-for-tat  cattle  mstling  that  sometimes  turned  deadly,  as  it  did  in  January 
2011  and  in  early  January  2012.  There  were  charges  that  local  and 
national  officials  were  involved  in  fomenting  the  violence. 

In  response  to  the  violence,  the  South  Sudan  government  initiated  a 
disarmament  campaign  in  Jonglei  in  March  2012,  but  the  Murle  charged 
that  in  the  process  SPLA  soldiers  engaged  in  beatings,  murder,  rape,  and 
torture.  Such  charges  played  into  the  hands  of  a  local  rebel  leader,  David 
Yau  Yau,  whose  rebellion  was  the  result  of  long-standing  Murle  griev¬ 
ances  against  the  SPLA  and  of  Yau  Yau's  disappointment  over  a  lost  elec¬ 
tion.  Despite  Yau  Yau’s  rebellion,  militia  activity  in  South  Sudan  declined 
after  201 1.  In  April  2013,  President  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  extended  an  offer 
of  amnesty  to  six  rebel  leaders,  including  Yau  Yau,  who  reconciled  with 
the  government  in  January  2014.  Meanwhile,  the  cattle-raiding  in  Jonglei 
continued,  with  a  report  of  upwards  of  1 1,000  Nuer  involved  in  a  raid  on 
the  Murle  in  July. 

The  violence  in  Jonglei  and  elsewhere  in  the  South  tested  the  capabil¬ 
ities  of  the  SPLA,  given  that  it  was  itself  composed  of  militiamen  from 
the  very  ethnic  groups  often  involved  in  the  violence.  It  was  also  beyond 
the  capabilities  of  the  United  Nations  Mission  in  the  Republic  of  South 
Sudan  (UNMISS),  the  remnant  of  the  UN  supervisory  force  for  the  whole 
of  Sudan  before  separation.  In  an  effort  to  deal  with  intercommunal  vio¬ 
lence  across  South  Sudan,  President  Kiir  appointed  a  national  reconcilia¬ 
tion  committee  in  April  2013  and  handed  its  leadership  to  prominent 
clerics.  Clerical  mediation  enabled  David  Yau  Yau  to  end  his  rebellion. 

Another  problem  requiring  immediate  attention  was  settling  returnees 
from  the  North.  Numbering  some  2  million  since  the  signing  of  the  CPA  in 
2005,  they  flooded  back  into  a  homeland  many,  if  not  most,  had  never 
known.  On  the  one  hand,  they  were  unprepared  for  the  dire  straits  of  the 
South;  on  the  other  hand,  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement 
(SPLM)  government  faced  the  problem  of  settling  them  and  of  providing 
employment.  To  the  returnees  were  added  more  than  350,000  internally 
displaced  persons  resulting  from  intercommunal  conflict,  and  a  quarter 
million  refugees  fleeing  conflict  in  Blue  Nile  and  South  Kordofan  States  in 
the  North.  In  and  after  2011,  international  aid  agencies  were  active  in  deal¬ 
ing  with  all  three  groups. 

Aid  agencies  were  also  active  in  the  fields  of  education  and  health,  as 
was  the  government  in  Juba,  the  capital.  UN  statistics  showed  that  pri¬ 
mary-school  enrollments  had  doubled  since  the  signing  of  the  CPA  in 


xlviii 


2005,  but  completion  rates  were  still  quite  low.  Adult  literacy  was  also 
low,  a  major  factor  accounting  for  the  lack  of  skilled  manpower.  The 
South  was  plagued  by  major  curable  diseases  such  as  yellow  fever, 
malaria,  and  sleeping  sickness;  rates  of  maternal  and  child  mortality  were 
high;  and  malnutrition  was  common.  Nearly  one-third  of  Southerners  had 
no  access  to  primary  health  care  in  2011  according  to  the  UN,  a  conse¬ 
quence  of  the  scarcity  of  trained  medical  personnel  to  serve  a  population 
estimated  at  about  10  million.  A  wide  range  of  other  issues  facing  the  new 
government  included  ensuring  a  steady  flow  of  income  from  oil,  ques¬ 
tions  about  press  freedom,  substandard  prison  conditions,  and  continued 
integration  of  former  rebel  fighters  into  a  unified  SPLA. 

A  final  problem  facing  the  Southern  leadership  was  perhaps  the  most 
difficult  and  yet  the  most  important  to  solve — the  creation  of  a  national 
identity  and  a  sense  of  unity  among  Southerners.  Before  separation  in 
2011,  Southerners  had  been  unified  in  their  opposition  to  the  North,  but 
following  independence,  a  new  sense  that  they  belonged  together  in  their 
own  separate  nation  was  called  for  if  South  Sudan  were  to  develop  into  a 
mature  nation-state.  Events  in  and  after  mid-2013,  however,  showed  how 
far  Southerners  were  from  a  unified  whole. 

There  had  been  dissension  within  the  SPLM/A  since  its  creation,  but  in 
mid-2013  these  divisions  burst  into  the  open  in  a  new  and  dangerous  form 
along  both  personality  and  ethnic  lines.  At  issue  was  the  need  for  responsi¬ 
ble  leadership  and  good  governance.  One  of  the  basic  divisions  within  the 
SPLM/A  was  that  between  the  Dinka  and  the  Nuer,  with  the  latter  alleging 
domination  of  the  movement  by  the  Dinka  under  first  John  Garang  and 
then  Salva  Kiir,  both  Dinkas.  In  the  post-independence  interim  govern¬ 
ment,  Salva  Kiir  served  as  president,  and  Riek  Machar  Teny,  a  Nuer,  as 
vice  president.  Machar  had  long  sought  to  lead  the  SPLM;  his  ambition 
made  him  a  rival  with  a  large  constituency  within  the  SPLM/A. 

Tension  between  the  two  leaders  grew  to  the  point  that  on  July  23,  Kin- 
dismissed  Machar  from  office  along  with  several  members  of  the  cabinet. 
Aside  from  rivalry  between  the  two  leaders,  the  dismissals  reflected  dis¬ 
content  within  the  SPLM  and  other  Southern  groups  over  the  lack  of  trans¬ 
parency  and  participation  in  the  government.  There  were  in  addition 
allegations  of  corruption  and  of  high-handedness  in  governing  on  the  part 
of  Kiir  and  the  top  tier  of  SPLM  officials.  Following  his  dismissal,  Machar 
announced  that  he  would  challenge  Kiir  for  the  chairmanship  of  the 
SPLM  with  the  intent  of  becoming  the  SPLM  candidate  for  the  presidency 
in  the  upcoming  2015  elections.  Machar  and  his  followers  became  known 
as  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement  in  Opposition  (SPLM-IO). 

In  mid-December,  fighting  broke  out  in  Juba  between  Dinka  and  Nuer 
units  of  the  presidential  guard  following  what  the  government  termed  an 
attempted  coup,  which  it  blamed  on  Machar,  a  charge  he  denied.  The 


xlix 


fighting  spread  beyond  the  capital  to  Jonglei  State  and  then  into  Upper 
Nile  and  Unity  States  in  early  2014,  leading  to  attacks  and  massacres  by 
one  group  and  its  allies  on  the  other,  with  bloody  incidents  in  Bor,  Bentiu, 
and  elsewhere.  Cease-fire  agreements  of  January  23  and  May  9  arranged 
in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Inter-Governmental 
Authority  on  Development  (IGAD — see  Glossary),  a  northeast  Africa 
regional  organization,  failed,  as  both  sides  continued  to  fight,  seeking 
advantage  through  control  of  territory  and  resources,  especially  oil  installa¬ 
tions  and  income,  before  engaging  in  serious  negotiations.  After  demands 
from  IGAD  and  the  international  community,  a  third  cease-fire  agreement 
was  signed  in  Addis  Ababa  on  June  10.  It  called  for  immediate  negotia¬ 
tions  on  substantive  issues,  inclusion  of  all  stakeholders  in  the  peace  talks, 
access  for  humanitarian  relief  efforts,  and  a  transitional  government  of 
national  unity  to  be  in  place  within  60  days. 

The  June  agreement  held  forth  the  prospect  of  peace  and  a  new  govern¬ 
ment  in  South  Sudan  in  the  near  future.  After  a  delay  over  differences 
regarding  representation  in  the  stakeholder  organizations,  both  sides 
began  talks  in  early  August,  but  they  failed  to  establish  a  transitional  gov¬ 
ernment  in  Juba  by  the  August  10  deadline.  By  then,  the  toll  of  half  a  year 
of  fighting  was  evident:  thousands  killed,  1  million  internally  displaced, 
destruction  of  infrastructure,  and  the  specter  of  devastating  famine. 
Clearly,  the  viability  of  South  Sudan  was  in  question  in  mid-2014,  given 
the  deep-seated  hostility  between  the  SPLM/A  and  SPLM/A-IO  and  their 
allied  groups.  It  was  also  clear  that  a  common  identity  and  sense  of  unity 
among  all  Southerners  remained  distant  goals. 

Northern  Sudan 

The  situation  facing  the  North,  the  Republic  of  Sudan,  in  2011  was 
almost  as  dire  for,  as  in  the  South,  the  al-Bashir  regime  faced  major  chal¬ 
lenges  on  the  economic,  military,  political,  and  regional  fronts.  The  econ¬ 
omy  had  long  suffered  from  mismanagement,  but  the  separation  of  the 
South  dealt  a  major  blow  to  the  Northern  economy  by  nullifying  the 
shared  income  from  oil  exports  that  had  flowed  during  the  period  of  the 
CPA.  Then,  a  dispute  with  the  South  over  pipeline  and  port  fees  led  the 
South  in  January  2012  to  shut  down  all  oil  production  and,  therefore,  all 
exports  through  Northern  pipelines,  an  act  with  grave  consequences  for 
both  Northern  and  Southern  finances.  Deprived  of  oil  income,  the  NCP 
government  resorted  to  austerity  measures  as  a  way  to  confront  a  shrink¬ 
ing  economy,  rising  prices,  and  inflation.  There  was  also  the  looming 
external  debt. 

On  the  political  side,  the  NCP  continued  its  monopolized  control  of  the 
national  government  and  the  military.  It  faced  only  weak  opposition  from 
long-established  political  parties  such  as  the  Umma  Party  and  the  Demo- 


1 


cratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP),  but  now  it  confronted  a  new  protest  move¬ 
ment  among  urban  youth.  Inspired  in  part  by  the  “Arab  Spring”  across 
North  Africa,  young  educated  Sudanese  engaged  in  street  demonstrations 
in  major  cities,  protesting  austerity  measures  and  the  lack  of  employment 
and  calling  for  a  more  open  and  democratic  political  system,  one  in  which 
they  sought  a  voice.  The  regime  responded  with  repression,  a  policy  that 
gradually  succeeded  in  squelching  the  demonstrations  but  that  failed  to 
address  the  demands  of  the  young  protesters. 

Aside  from  the  young,  the  regime  faced  more  serious  and  organized 
opposition  from  both  the  political  and  military  fronts.  Beginning  in  late 
2008,  the  major  elements  of  the  political  opposition  joined  together  to  form 
the  National  Consensus  Forces  (NCF).  The  membership  includes  the 
Umma  led  by  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  the  Popular  Congress  Party  of  Hassan 
Abdallah  al-Turabi,  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party  of  Muhammad  Uthman 
al-Mirghani,  and  various  smaller  political  groups,  plus  women’s  and  youth 
organizations.  The  NCF  program  as  issued  in  July  2012  favors  a  transi¬ 
tional  government  of  national  unity,  a  new  national  constitution,  and  settle¬ 
ment  of  disputes  in  Darfur,  Blue  Nile,  and  the  Nuba  Mountains  by  dialogue, 
not  war.  On  the  military  side,  conflict  broke  out  in  the  Nuba  Mountains  of 
South  Kordofan  even  before  South  Sudan  declared  its  independence,  and 
then  subsequently  in  Blue  Nile  State.  In  both  areas,  local  forces  had  joined 
with  the  SPLA  against  Khartoum  during  the  civil  war.  Now,  in  201 1,  they 
sought  a  degree  of  autonomy  and  political  reform  within  the  North.  When 
the  “popular  consultations”  called  for  by  the  CPA  stalled  in  both  regions 
and  these  remnants  of  the  SPLA  consequently  refused  to  disarm,  the  SAF 
invaded  South  Kordofan  on  June  5  and  Blue  Nile  on  September  1.  The 
SPLA  remnants  in  the  Nuba  Mountains  succeeded  in  repulsing  the  SAF, 
but  in  Blue  Nile  they  were  driven  to  the  borderlands  with  Ethiopia  and 
South  Sudan,  the  fighting  in  each  area  eventually  settling  mostly  into  a 
stalemate.  These  Northern  insurgents  renamed  themselves  the  SPLM/A-N 
(North)  and  on  November  1 1  announced  formation  of  the  Sudan  Revolu¬ 
tionary  Front  (SRF).  They  were  joined  by  the  major  Darfuri  opposition 
forces — the  Justice  and  Equality  Movement/Army  and  the  two  factions  of 
the  Sudan  Liberation  Movement — and  in  April  2012,  by  the  Beja  Congress 
in  the  East.  The  SRF  stood  for  the  overthrow  of  the  al-Bashir  regime  by 
force  and  its  replacement  with  a  more  inclusive  political  system. 

On  January  5,  2013,  representatives  of  the  SRF  and  the  NCF  signed  an 
agreement  in  Kampala,  Uganda,  that  essentially  combined  their  programs. 
Known  as  the  New  Dawn  Charter,  the  document  called  for  the  replacement 
of  the  NCP  government  by  peaceful,  constitutional  means  if  possible,  oth¬ 
erwise  by  force;  a  democratic  and  federal  system  of  government;  and  the 
separation  of  religion  and  state,  among  other  provisions.  The  charter,  being 
a  repudiation  of  NCP  rule  under  al-Bashir,  provoked  a  swift  response.  The 


li 


regime  vehemently  denounced  it,  labeled  its  signatories  traitors,  and 
promptly  arrested  some  of  the  signers  upon  their  return  to  the  country. 

Perhaps  most  significantly,  continued  governance  from  the  center  to 
the  exclusion  of  Darfur,  South  Kordofan,  Blue  Nile,  and  the  East,  meant 
that  the  cycle  of  violence  associated  with  peripheral  peoples  and  regions 
would  perpetuate  itself  and  continue  to  take  its  toll  on  the  energies  and 
resources  of  all  sides.  Indeed,  the  issue  of  governance  and  exclusion  from 
the  functions  and  offices  of  state  lay  at  the  heart  of  the  rebellions  among 
the  peoples  of  Sudan’s  borderlands.  Until  the  aspirations  of  these  peoples 
were  addressed,  Sudan  was  unlikely  to  find  peace.  There  was  even  the 
prospect  of  the  emergence  of  a  “New  South,”  a  region  stretching  from 
Darfrir  in  the  west  through  Abyei  and  South  Kordofan  to  Blue  Nile  State 
in  the  east  that  would  supplant  the  SPLM/A-dominated  South  as  a  region 
in  permanent  rebellion  against  the  governing  elite  in  Khartoum. 

While  the  NCP  continued  to  hold  the  reins  of  power  and  to  forcefully 
repress  protest  movements  and  rebellions,  the  party  even  before  2011  was 
hardly  a  unified  whole.  Corruption  and  nepotism  have  long  characterized 
NCP  mle,  factors  that  produced  discontent  and  resentment.  Now,  in  the 
post-referendum  and  post-separation  era,  added  to  the  range  of  issues  fac¬ 
ing  the  party  and  regime  was  the  charge  of  having  “lost”  the  South. 
Against  this  background,  divisions  over  state  policy  and  the  future  of  the 
NCP  surfaced  among  the  party’s  rank  and  file,  broadly  divided  into  two 
camps.  On  the  one  hand  were  those  who  favored  some  type  of  reform  of 
the  party  to  ensure  its  survival;  on  the  other  hand  were  those  who  saw  no 
need  to  make  changes  or  concessions  of  any  kind,  despite  the  challenges 
that  confronted  the  party  and  regime.  Nonetheless,  members  of  both 
camps  remained  committed  Islamists  and  appeared  to  accept  al-Bashir’s 
vision  of  Sudan  as  a  state  that  would  be  “Arab”  in  culture,  Islamist  in  reli¬ 
gious  conviction,  and  governed  by  the  sharia — this  despite  Muslim  Suda¬ 
nese  who  were  not  Islamists  and  the  wide  variety  of  Sudanese  who  were 
neither  Muslim  nor  “Arab.” 

Discontent  within  the  NCP  as  well  as  in  the  armed  forces  became  evi¬ 
dent  in  November  2012,  when  the  regime  announced  the  arrest  of  one  or 
more  senior  party  leaders  and  more  than  a  dozen  senior  army  officers, 
heretofore  considered  loyal  Islamists,  whom  it  accused  of  planning  a  coup. 
Among  those  detained  was  Salah  Gosh,  the  former  head  of  national  intelli¬ 
gence  and  later  a  presidential  adviser  for  security.  The  next  month,  the 
regime  announced  the  arrest  of  several  more  military  leaders  on  charges  of 
plotting  a  coup,  a  step  that  raised  questions  about  the  extent  of  the  disaffec¬ 
tion  with  NCP  policies.  Even  as  the  government  foiled  these  attempts  at 
regime  change,  whether  actual  or  alleged,  they  appeared  to  be  clear  evi¬ 
dence  of  peer  rivalries  within  the  NCP  and  of  significant  discontent  in  the 
army.  An  alternative — and  peaceful — avenue  of  change  might  lie  in 


Hi 


national  elections,  scheduled  for  April  2015,  in  which  al-Bashir  announced 
that  he  would  not  be  a  candidate. 

The  general  discontent  within  the  party,  the  armed  forces,  and  the  coun¬ 
try  at  large  commanded  the  attention  of  the  regime  in  and  after  mid-2013. 
In  an  effort  to  further  reduce  the  budget  deficit  resulting  from  the  loss  of  oil 
revenue  in  2011,  the  regime  once  again  cut  fuel  subsidies  on  September 
23,  2013.  The  reduction  led  to  10  days  of  violent  demonstrations  as  the 
urban  and  rural  poor,  students,  and  now  the  middle  class,  united  by  eco¬ 
nomic  grievances  related  to  subsidies,  inflation,  and  unemployment,  took 
to  the  streets.  There  were  calls  not  only  to  restore  the  fuel  subsidy  but  also 
to  bring  down  the  regime.  The  protests  were  the  most  serious  the  al-Bashir 
government  had  ever  faced.  More  than  200  protesters  were  killed  as  the 
security  forces  restored  order,  according  to  Amnesty  International;  the 
regime  put  the  figure  at  less  than  half  of  that. 

In  April,  al-Bashir  had  made  a  proposal  for  a  broad  political  dialogue 
about  the  future  of  the  country.  In  late  January  2014,  clearly  in  response  to 
the  September  outburst,  he  repeated  his  proposal  in  a  formal  presentation 
before  supporters  and  opponents  of  the  government.  He  called  for  an  eco¬ 
nomic  and  political  “renaissance”  for  Sudan  that  would  address  four 
issues:  peace  on  all  fronts,  political  freedom,  poverty  reduction,  and  Suda¬ 
nese  national  identity,  of  which  peace  was  first  and  foremost.  Major  oppo¬ 
sition  leaders  such  as  al-Turabi  and  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  reacted  skeptically  to 
the  proposal  but  subsequently  proved  more  receptive.  The  NCF,  SRF,  and 
other  critics,  however,  demanded  that  the  government  first  create  an  envi¬ 
ronment  conducive  to  dialogue,  before  they  would  participate,  by  taking 
such  steps  as  declaring  a  cease-fire  on  all  fronts,  ensuring  humanitarian 
access  to  all  war  zones,  and  agreeing  to  a  national  coalition  government  to 
administer  the  dialogue  process.  Finally,  there  were  calls  to  postpone  the 
national  elections  scheduled  for  2015  in  view  of  the  unsettled  state  of 
affairs  throughout  the  country. 

The  government  rejected  these  demands.  It  did,  however,  permit  politi¬ 
cal  parties  to  function  more  freely  in  early  2014,  although  arrests  of  oppo¬ 
sition  figures,  including  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  in  May  when  he  alleged  atrocities 
by  Rapid  Support  Forces  in  Darfur,  and  press  censorship  continued.  At 
mid-year,  the  regime  and  opposition  groups  such  as  the  NCF  and  SRF 
continued  to  spar  over  the  parameters  of  a  national  dialogue,  even  as  fight¬ 
ing  was  ongoing  in  Darfur  and  as  government  forces  attacked  SPLA-N 
positions  in  South  Kordofan.  On  July  24,  a  national  dialogue  committee, 
composed  of  representatives  of  the  government  and  government-approved 
opposition  parties,  announced  that  the  national  dialogue  would  begin  in 
early  August  with  a  meeting  of  a  national  conference,  which  all  political 
parties  and  rebels  were  invited  to  attend.  The  opposition  parties  and  rebels, 
however,  declined  to  participate  until  their  demands,  including  a  general 


liii 


cease-fire  and  a  national-unity  government,  had  been  met.  Whether  any  of 
the  proposed  discussions  would  lead  to  a  meaningful  national  dialogue  and 
eventual  political  reforms  in  Sudan  was  an  open  question  in  mid-2014. 

The  Two  Sudans  in  2013-14 

At  the  time  of  separation  in  mid-201 1,  several  major  issues  were  out¬ 
standing  between  the  two  Sudans,  among  them  a  demarcated  border,  citi¬ 
zenship,  and  international  debt.  None,  however,  was  more  contentious 
than  oil.  The  CPA  provided  for  shared  revenues,  and  the  income  from  oil 
exports  became  cmcial  to  government  budgets  in  both  countries,  espe¬ 
cially  the  South,  where  it  composed  some  98  percent  of  government  reve¬ 
nue.  Almost  all  of  the  oil  lay  in  the  South  except  for  oil  fields  in  or  close  to 
Abyei,  claimed  by  both  North  and  South.  Refineries  and  the  pipelines  that 
carried  the  oil  to  Port  Sudan,  however,  lay  in  the  North.  Almost  immedi¬ 
ately  a  dispute  arose  over  pipeline  transit  fees,  with  Khartoum  demanding 
much  higher  rates  than  the  South  was  prepared  to  pay.  When  Khartoum 
diverted  some  oil  as  compensation  for  what  it  considered  unpaid  fees,  and 
given  the  poor  state  of  relations  between  North  and  South,  the  Southern 
government  shut  down  oil  production  in  January  2012. 

The  impact  on  state  budgets  was  devastating,  and  it  was  uncertain  how 
long  the  loss  of  income  from  oil  could  be  sustained.  Both  states  enacted 
austerity  measures,  which  set  off  inflation  and  were  partly  responsible  for 
anti-regime  protests  in  Northern  cities.  In  early  April,  fighting  broke  out  in 
Abyei  over  control  of  the  enclave  and  its  oil  resources,  and  there  were 
fears  that  the  clashes  could  widen  into  full-scale  war  between  North  and 
South.  Abyei  was  one  of  a  range  of  outstanding  issues  discussed  during 
subsequent  meetings  between  Khartoum  and  Juba,  but  the  two  govern¬ 
ments  could  not  agree  on  their  respective  representation  in  an  interim  leg¬ 
islature,  on  the  scheduling  of  a  referendum  on  the  future  of  the  region  as 
called  for  in  the  CPA,  or  on  who  would  be  eligible  to  vote  in  it.  In  20 1 1  the 
UN  created  the  Interim  Security  Force  for  Abyei  and  repeatedly  extended 
its  mandate.  In  June  2014,  the  force  numbered  4,109  unifonned  person¬ 
nel,  nearly  all  of  them  Ethiopian  peacekeepers. 

Under  pressure  from  the  African  Union  and  Western  nations,  Khartoum 
and  Juba  agreed  on  a  fonnula  for  oil  transit  fees  in  August  2012,  which 
became  one  of  nine  parts  of  an  agreement  on  outstanding  issues  concluded 
on  September  27.  Transit  fees  for  Southern  oil  were  set  at  an  average  of 
US$10  per  barrel.  In  addition,  the  South  agreed  to  pay  US$3.03  billion  to  the 
North  during  the  next  three  and  one-half  years  as  compensation  for  revenue 
lost  during  the  shutdown.  Other  agreements  provided  for  nationals  of  each 
country  to  freely  reside  in,  work,  and  own  property  in  the  other  country;  for 
withdrawal  of  all  forces  to  their  own  side  of  the  border;  for  establishment  of 
a  14-mile  (22.5-kilometer)  wide  demilitarized  border  zone  to  be  supervised 


liv 


by  a  joint  border  verification  and  monitoring  mission;  for  opening  of  10  bor¬ 
der-crossing  corridors  to  facilitate  trade;  for  the  immediate  joint  demarcation 
of  the  border  between  North  and  South  on  the  basis  of  the  January  1,  1956, 
border  line;  and  for  joint  efforts  to  obtain  debt  relief  for  Sudan’s  international 
debt  as  at  the  time  of  separation,  or,  failing  that,  to  apportion  the  debt 
between  the  two  nations. 

Despite  pledges  of  good  will,  the  two  sides  still  found  it  difficult  to  work 
together.  Among  contentious  issues,  the  September  agreement  did  not  set¬ 
tle  the  status  of  Abyei  or  other  disputed  border  lands,  and  each  side  contin¬ 
ued  to  accuse  the  other  of  supporting  rebels  in  its  territory.  Nonetheless,  the 
two  sides  negotiated  a  follow-on  accord  in  mid-March  2013  that  set  a  two- 
to  three-week  timetable  for  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Sep¬ 
tember  agreement.  Both  sides  began  to  withdraw  their  forces  from  the 
demilitarized  zone  along  their  de  facto  border,  and  on  April  6,  South  Sudan 
resumed  pumping  oil  destined  for  Northern  pipelines.  Even  so,  issues  such 
as  border  demarcation  and  charges  of  support  for  each  side's  rebels  contin¬ 
ued  to  hinder  full  implementation  of  the  September  agreement.  Negotia¬ 
tions  about  these  as  well  as  other  outstanding  issues  between  North  and 
South  were  ongoing  as  of  mid-2014. 

The  restoration  of  the  oil-sharing  regime  and  the  consequent  budgetary 
support  it  would  provide  to  North  and  South,  together  with  the  remaining 
provisions  of  the  September  2012  agreement,  held  forth  the  prospect  of 
cooperation  and  peace  between  the  two  countries.  But  domestic  develop¬ 
ments  within  each  in  2013  and  2014  eclipsed  efforts  to  reach  any  such 
accommodation.  The  North,  shaken  by  violent  protests,  was  in  the  midst 
of  a  debate  about  political  reform  and  of  negotiations  with  rebels  of  the 
“New  South.”  The  South  was  embroiled  in  a  virtual  civil  war  that  threat¬ 
ened  the  very  existence  of  the  country.  In  mid-2014,  it  was  difficult  to  pre¬ 
dict  what  the  future  might  hold  for  either  country,  given  the  state  of  affairs 
within  each  and  the  long  history  of  troubled  relations  between  them.

mud-brick  villages,  where  they  supplemented  hunting  and  fishing  on 
the  Nile  with  grain  gathering  and  cattle  herding.  Contact  with  Egypt 
probably  occurred  early  in  the  culture’s  development  because  of  the 
steady  movement  of  people  along  the  Nile.  Skeletal  remains  suggest  a 
blending  of  African  and  Mediterranean  populations  during  the  Neo¬ 
lithic  period  (eighth  to  third  millennia  B.C.)  that  has  remained  rela¬ 
tively  stable  until  the  present,  despite  gradual  infiltration  by  other 
peoples. 

Kush 

Since  the  time  of  the  Roman  Empire,  the  region  of  northern  Sudan 
from  roughly  the  second  cataract  on  the  Nile  as  far  as  the  fourth  cata¬ 
ract,  or  even  farther  south,  has  been  known  as  Nubia.  The  ancient  Egyp¬ 
tians,  however,  called  the  land  south  of  the  second  cataract  Kush  (also 
seen  as  Cush)  and  referred  to  its  inhabitants  as  “the  wretched  Kush.” 
For  more  than  2,000  years  after  the  Old  Kingdom  (ca.  2650-2150 
B.C.),  Egyptian  economic  and  political  activities  greatly  influenced  the 
course  of  the  central  Nile  region’s  history.  Even  during  periods  when 
Egyptian  political  power  in  Kush  waned,  the  Egyptians  exerted  pro¬ 
found  cultural  and  religious  influence  on  the  indigenous  people. 

Trade  developed  naturally  among  the  peoples  of  the  Nile  valley. 
Egyptian  caravans  carried  grain  to  northern  Sudan  and  returned  with 
gold,  ivory,  incense,  hides,  and  camelian  (a  stone  prized  both  in  jewelry 
and  for  arrowheads).  Egyptian  traders  especially  valued  gold  as  well  as 
slaves,  who  became  servants,  concubines,  or  soldiers.  The  Egyptians 
sent  military  expeditions  into  Kush  during  the  Old  Kingdom,  yet  no 
attempt  was  made  to  establish  a  permanent  footing  in  the  area  until  the 
Middle  Kingdom  (ca.  2040-1640  B.C.),  when  the  Egyptians  built  forts 
along  the  Nile  as  far  as  Semna,  south  of  the  second  cataract,  to  protect 
gold  mines  in  the  area. 

Asian  nomads  known  as  the  Hyksos  invaded  Egypt  and  brought  the 
Middle  Kingdom  to  an  end  around  1640  B.C.  Egyptian  links  with 
northern  Sudan  were  severed,  and  the  Nile  River  forts  were  aban¬ 
doned.  By  then  a  distinct  indigenous  Bronze-Age  culture,  centered  on 
the  city  of  Kerma,  had  developed  and  had  evolved  into  the  kingdom  of 
Kush  in  the  region  around  the  third  cataract,  near  present-day  Dongola 
(see  fig.  4).  The  kingdom  of  Kush  was  almost  certainly  one  of  the  ear¬ 
liest  kingdoms  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  It  eventually  dominated  some 
700  kilometers  along  the  Nile,  and  its  power  made  it  a  major  rival  of 
Egypt.  Kerma ’s  culture  and  traditions  of  power  influenced  northern 
Sudan  for  a  millennium  and  enjoyed  a  revival  during  the  first  millen¬ 
nium  B.C.  at  Napata,  near  present-day  Kuraymah.  About  1500  B.C, 
after  the  Egyptians  revived  during  the  New  Kingdom  (ca.  1540-1075

Historical  Setting 


B.C.),  the  pharaohs  defeated  Kush  and  made  it  an  Egyptian  province. 
Egyptian  administrative  control  extended  as  far  south  as  the  fourth  cat¬ 
aract;  tributary  districts  extended  east  to  the  Red  Sea  and  south  nearly 
to  the  confluence  of  the  Nile  and  the  Atbarah  Rivers.  Egypt  exacted 
tribute  in  gold  and  slaves  from  local  chiefs  and  ensured  their  loyalty 
by  drafting  their  children  to  serve  as  pages  at  the  pharaoh’s  court. 

Once  Egypt  had  established  control  over  Kush,  officials  and  priests 
joined  military  personnel,  merchants,  and  artisans  and  settled  in  the 
region.  The  ancient  Egyptian  language  became  widely  used  in  every¬ 
day  activities.  The  Kushite  elite  adopted  Egyptian  gods  and  built  tem¬ 
ples  like  the  one  dedicated  to  the  sun  god  Amun  at  Napata.  The 
temples  remained  centers  of  official  religious  worship  until  the  coming 
of  Christianity  to  the  region  in  the  sixth  century  A.D. 

By  the  eleventh  century  B.C.,  the  New  Kingdom’s  authority  had 
diminished,  giving  way  to  divided  rule  in  Egypt  and  ending  Egyptian  con¬ 
trol  of  Kush.  In  the  eighth  century  B.C.,  Kush  reemerged  as  an  indepen¬ 
dent  kingdom  ruled  from  Napata  by  monarchs  who  gradually  extended 
their  influence  into  Egypt.  Long  after  Egyptian  influence  declined  as 
Egyptians  themselves  succumbed  to  foreign  domination,  the  Kushite  elite 
continued  to  regard  themselves  as  champions  of  genuine  Egyptian  cultural 
and  religious  values.  About  750  B.C.,  a  Kushite  king  called  Kashta  con¬ 
quered  Upper  Egypt  and  became  ruler  of  Thebes.  His  successor,  Piankhy, 
subdued  the  delta,  reunited  Egypt  under  the  Twenty-fifth  Dynasty,  and 
founded  a  line  of  kings  who  ruled  Kush  and  Thebes  for  nearly  a  century. 
The  dynasty’s  intervention  in  the  area  of  modem  Syria  caused  a  confron¬ 
tation  between  Egypt  and  Assyria.  When  the  Assyrians  in  retaliation 
invaded  Egypt,  Taharqa  (688-663  B.C.),  the  last  Kushite  pharaoh,  with¬ 
drew  to  Napata,  where  Kushite  kings  not  only  continued  to  mle  but 
extended  their  dominions  to  the  south  and  east. 

Meroe 

An  Egyptian  army  sacked  Napata  in  590  B.C.,  compelling  the  Kushite 
court  to  move  south  to  a  more  secure  location  at  Meroe,  just  south  of  the 
Atbarah-Nile  confluence.  For  several  centuries,  the  Meroitic  kingdom 
developed  independently  of  Egypt,  which  passed  successively  under  Per¬ 
sian,  Greek,  and  Roman  domination.  During  the  height  of  Meroe ’s 
power  in  the  second  and  third  centuries  B.C.,  the  kingdom  extended  over 
a  region  from  the  third  cataract  in  the  north  to  Soba,  near  present-day 
Khartoum,  in  the  south. 

The  pharaonic  tradition  persisted  among  rulers  at  Meroe,  who  raised 
stelae  to  record  the  achievements  of  their  reigns  and  erected  pyramids  to 
contain  their  tombs.  These  objects  and  the  mins  of  palaces,  temples,  and 
baths  at  Meroe  attest  to  a  centralized  political  system  that  commanded

the  labor  of  a  large  workforce,  including  skilled  artisans.  A  well-man¬ 
aged  irrigation  system  supported  a  higher  population  density  than  was 
possible  during  later  periods.  By  the  first  century  B.C.,  the  use  of  hiero¬ 
glyphs  had  given  way  to  a  Meroitic  script,  which  adapted  the  Egyptian 
writing  system  to  the  indigenous  language  that  is  related  to  the  present- 
day  Nubian  spoken  in  this  region.  Meroe’s  succession  system  was  not 
necessarily  hereditary.  The  matriarchal  royal  family  member  deemed 
most  worthy  often  became  ruler,  the  queen  mother’s  role  in  the  selection 
process  being  crucial  to  a  smooth  succession.  The  crown  appears  to 
have  passed  from  brother  to  brother  (or  sister),  and  only  when  no  sib¬ 
lings  remained  from  father  to  son. 

Although  Napata  remained  Meroe’s  religious  center,  northern  Kush 
fell  into  disorder  as  it  came  under  pressure  from  the  Blemmyes,  preda¬ 
tory  nomads  from  east  of  the  Nile  who  were  probably  ancestors  of  the 
present-day  Beja.  However,  the  Nile  continued  to  give  the  region  access 
to  the  Mediterranean  world.  Additionally,  Meroe  maintained  contact 
with  Arab  and  Indian  traders  along  the  Red  Sea  coast  and  incorporated 
Hellenistic  and  Hindu  cultural  influences  into  its  daily  life.  Metallurgi¬ 
cal  technology,  especially  ironworking,  developed  at  Meroe,  knowledge 
of  which  may  have  been  transmitted  westward  across  the  savanna  belt 
to  West  Africa  from  Meroe’s  iron  smelteries. 

Meroe’s  relations  with  its  northern  neighbors  were  not  always  peace¬ 
ful.  In  23  B.C.  a  Roman  army  razed  Napata  in  response  to  Meroitic  incur¬ 
sions  into  Upper  Egypt.  The  Roman  commander  quickly  abandoned  the 
area,  however,  judging  it  too  poor  to  warrant  colonization. 

By  the  beginning  of  the  Christian  era,  a  people  known  as  the  Noba 
or  Nuba  had  occupied  northern  Kush.  (The  term  Nubia ,  by  which  much 
of  northern  Sudan  is  known  today,  derives  from  the  name  of  this  peo¬ 
ple.)  The  Noba  are  believed  to  have  been  one  of  several  well-armed 
bands  of  warriors  who  sold  protection  to  the  Meroitic  population;  even¬ 
tually  they  intermarried  and  established  themselves  among  the  Meroitic 
people  as  a  military  aristocracy.  Until  nearly  the  fifth  century,  Rome 
subsidized  the  Noba  and  used  Meroe  as  a  buffer  between  Egypt  and  the 
Blemmyes.  The  cause  of  Meroe’s  decline,  including  the  role  of  invad¬ 
ing  peoples,  is  still  subject  to  debate,  but  it  has  traditionally  been  asso¬ 
ciated  with  the  expansion  of  Aksum,  a  trading  state  in  modem  Eritrea 
and  Ethiopia  to  the  east  of  Sudan.  About  A.D.  350,  an  Aksumite  army 
captured  and  destroyed  Meroe  city,  ending  the  kingdom’s  independent 
existence. 

Christian  Nubia 

By  the  sixth  century,  three  states  had  emerged  as  heirs  to  the 
Meroitic  kingdom,  all  subject  to  Byzantine  influence.  Nobadia  in  the 


7 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


north  had  its  capital  at  Faras,  in  what  is  now  Egypt;  to  its  south,  the 
kingdom  of  Muqurra  was  centered  at  (Old)  Dongola,  a  city  on  the  Nile 
about  100  kilometers  south  of  modem  Dongola;  and  Aiwa,  in  the  heart¬ 
land  of  old  Meroe  farther  south,  had  its  capital  at  Soba.  In  all  three 
kingdoms,  warrior  aristocracies  ruled  over  local  Nubian  populations. 

Tradition  holds  that  about  540,  a  Christian  missionary  arrived  in 
Nobadia  and  began  to  preach  the  gospel,  but  it  is  possible  that  conver¬ 
sions  began  earlier  under  the  aegis  of  Coptic  missionaries  from  Egypt. 
The  Nubian  kings  accepted  the  Monophysite  Christianity  practiced  in 
Egypt  and  acknowledged  the  spiritual  authority  of  Alexandria’s  Cop¬ 
tic  patriarch  over  the  Nubian  church.  Bishops  named  by  the  Coptic 
patriarch  and  consecrated  in  Egypt  directed  the  church’s  activities  and 
wielded  considerable  secular  power.  The  church  sanctioned  sacerdotal 
kingship,  confirming  the  royal  line’s  legitimacy;  in  return,  the  mon- 
archs  protected  the  church’s  interests.  The  queen  mother’s  role  in  the 
succession  process  paralleled  that  of  Meroe’s  matriarchal  tradition. 
Because  women  transmitted  the  right  to  succession,  a  renowned  war¬ 
rior  not  of  royal  birth  might  be  nominated  to  become  king  through 
marriage  to  a  woman  in  the  line  of  succession. 

The  spread  of  Christianity  opened  channels  to  Mediterranean  civili¬ 
zation  and  renewed  Nubia’s  cultural  and  religious  ties  with  Egypt.  The 
church  encouraged  literacy  in  Nubia  through  its  Egyptian-trained 
clergy  and  schools,  but  the  use  of  Greek  in  the  liturgy  eventually  gave 
way  to  the  Nubian  language,  written  in  an  indigenous  script  that  com¬ 
bined  elements  of  old  Meroitic  and  Coptic.  Coptic,  however,  often 
appeared  in  ecclesiastical  and  secular  circles,  and  Nubians  apparently 
used  colloquial  Greek  as  late  as  the  twelfth  century.  After  the  seventh 
century,  Arabic  gained  importance  in  the  Nubian  kingdoms,  especially 
as  a  medium  for  commerce. 

The  Christian  Nubian  kingdoms  achieved  their  peak  of  prosperity 
and  military  power  in  the  ninth  and  tenth  centuries.  However,  Muslim 
Arab  invaders,  who  conquered  Egypt  in  640,  posed  a  threat  to  them;  it 
may  have  been  this  threat  that  compelled  Nobadia  and  Muqurra  to 
merge  into  the  kingdom  of  Dongola  some  time  before  700.  Although 
the  Arabs  soon  abandoned  attempts  to  overcome  Nubia  by  force,  Mus¬ 
lim  domination  of  Egypt  made  it  difficult  to  communicate  with  the 
Coptic  patriarch  or  to  obtain  Egyptian-trained  clergy.  As  a  result,  the 
Nubian  church  became  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  Christian  world. 

The  Coming  of  Islam 

Islam  eventually  changed  the  nature  of  Sudanese  society  and  contrib¬ 
uted  to  the  country’s  division  into  North  and  South.  Islam  also  fostered 
political  unity,  economic  growth,  and  educational  development  among

its  adherents.  However,  these  benefits  did  not  extend  beyond  urban  and 
commercial  centers.  Muslims  maintain  that  Islam  (literally,  submission) 
unites  the  individual  believer,  the  state,  and  society  under  God’s  will 
(see  Islam:  Tenets  and  Practice,  eh.  2).  Islamic  rulers,  therefore,  exercise 
temporal  and  religious  authority.  Islamic  law  (sharia)  derived  primarily 
from  the  Quran,  encompasses  all  aspects  of  the  lives  of  believers,  called 
Muslims  (“those  who  submit”  to  God’s  will). 

Within  a  decade  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad’s  death  in  632,  Arab 
armies  had  carried  Islam  into  North  Africa  and  had  begun  to  impose 
political  control  over  conquered  territories.  The  Arabs  invaded  Nubia 
in  642  and  again  in  652,  when  they  laid  siege  to  Dongola.  The  Nubi¬ 
ans  put  up  a  stout  defense,  however,  and  forced  the  Arabs  to  accept  an 
armistice  and  to  withdraw  their  forces. 

The  Arabs 

Contact  between  Nubians  and  Arabs  long  predated  the  coming  of 
Islam,  but  the  Arabization  of  the  Nile  valley  was  a  gradual  process  that 
took  nearly  1,000  years.  Arab  nomads  continually  wandered  into  the 
region  in  search  of  fresh  pasturage,  and  Arab  seafarers  and  merchants 
traded  in  Red  Sea  ports  for  spices  and  slaves.  After  a  successful  expe¬ 
dition  as  far  as  Dongola  in  652,  Egypt’s  Arab  commander,  Abdallah 
ibn  Sa’ad,  concluded  the  first  in  a  series  of  regularly  renewed  treaties 
with  the  Nubians  that  governed  relations  between  the  two  peoples  for 
more  than  600  years.  So  long  as  Arabs  ruled  Egypt,  there  was  peace 
on  the  Nubian  frontier;  however,  when  non-Arabs  acquired  control  of 
the  Nile  delta,  Egyptian-Nubian  relations  became  troubled. 

The  Arabs  realized  the  commercial  advantages  of  peaceful  rela¬ 
tions  with  the  Nubians  and  used  the  treaties  to  ensure  that  travel  and 
trade  proceeded  unhindered  across  the  frontier.  The  treaties  also  con¬ 
tained  security  provisions  whereby  both  parties  agreed  that  neither 
was  obliged  to  come  to  the  defense  of  the  other  in  the  event  of  an 
attack  by  a  third  party.  Both  parties  agreed  to  an  exchange  of  annual 
tribute  as  a  gesture  of  good  will,  the  Nubians  in  slaves  and  the  Arabs 
in  grain.  This  formality  was  only  a  token  of  the  trade  that  developed 
between  the  two,  not  only  in  these  commodities  but  also  in  the  horses 
and  manufactured  goods  that  the  Arabs  brought  to  Nubia  and  in  the 
ivory,  gold,  gems,  gum  arabic  (from  Acacia  senega!),  and  cattle  they 
carried  back  to  Egypt  or  shipped  to  Arabia. 

Traditional  genealogies  trace  the  ancestry  of  most  of  the  Nile  val¬ 
ley’s  mixed  population  to  Arab  tribes  that  slowly  migrated  into  the 
region  beginning  in  about  the  ninth  century.  Even  many  non-Arabic- 
speaking  groups  claim  descent  from  Arab  forebears.  According  to 
Sudanese  tradition,  the  two  most  important  Arabic-speaking  groups  to 


10 


Historical  Setting 


emerge  in  Nubia  were  the  Ja’aliyyin  and  the  Juhayna  (see  Ethnic 
Groups,  eh.  2).  Both  showed  physiological  continuity  with  the  indige¬ 
nous  pre-Islamic  population.  In  this  historical  but  overly  generalized 
view,  the  Ja’aliyyin  have  been  seen  as  sedentary  farmers  and  herders  or 
as  townspeople  settled  along  the  Nile  and  in  Al-Gezira  (also  seen  as  Al- 
Jazirah,  the  land  between  the  White  Nile  and  the  Blue  Nile).  The 
Juhayna,  by  contrast,  have  been  seen  as  nomads,  composed  of  a  family 
of  tribes  that  include  the  Kababish,  Baqqara,  and  Shukriyyah.  Both 
Ja’aliyyin  and  Juhayna  formed  a  series  of  tribal  sheikhdoms  that  suc¬ 
ceeded  the  crumbling  Christian  Nubian  kingdoms  and  that  were  in  fre¬ 
quent  conflict  with  one  another  and  with  neighboring  non-Arabs.  In 
some  instances,  as  among  the  Beja,  the  indigenous  people  absorbed 
Arab  migrants  who  settled  among  them.  Acceptance  of  Islam  facili¬ 
tated  the  long-term  Arabizing  process,  as  did  intermarriage  and  contact 
with  Arab  merchants  and  settlers.  Exemption  from  taxation  in  regions 
under  Muslim  rule  also  proved  a  powerful  incentive  to  cultural  and  reli¬ 
gious  conversion. 

The  Decline  of  Christian  Nubia 

The  Nubian  kingdoms  maintained  their  political  independence  and 
their  commitment  to  Christianity  until  the  thirteenth  century.  In  the 
early  eighth  century  and  again  in  the  tenth  century,  Nubian  kings 
attacked  Egypt  to  force  the  release  of  the  imprisoned  Coptic  patriarch 
and  to  relieve  fellow  Christians  suffering  persecution  under  Muslim 
rulers.  In  1276,  however,  Egyptian  Mamluks,  an  elite  caste  of  often- 
unruly  soldier-administrators,  intervened  in  a  dynastic  dispute,  ousted 
Dongola’s  monarch,  and  delivered  the  crown  and  silver  cross  that 
symbolized  Nubian  kingship  to  a  rival  claimant.  Thereafter,  the  Mam¬ 
luks  intervened  repeatedly  in  Dongola’s  affairs. 

Because  of  frequent  intermarriage  between  Nubian  nobles  and  the 
kin  of  Arab  sheikhs,  the  lineages  of  the  two  elites  merged,  and  the 
Muslim  heirs  took  their  places  in  the  royal  line  of  succession.  In  1315 
a  Muslim  prince  of  Nubian  royal  blood  became  king  of  Dongola.  A 
“dark  age”  enveloped  Nubia  in  the  fifteenth  century,  during  which 
political  authority  fragmented  and  slave  raiding  intensified.  Mean¬ 
while,  Arab  tribes  were  gradually  migrating  south  from  Egypt  along 
the  Nile,  bringing  Islam  with  them.  Communities  in  the  river  valley 
and  savannah,  fearful  for  their  safety,  formed  tribal  organizations  and 
adopted  Arab  protectors.  The  Nubian  Christian  population  slowly 
dwindled;  even  so,  Muslims  probably  did  not  constitute  a  majority  in 
the  old  Nubian  areas  until  the  fifteenth  or  sixteenth  century.

The  Rule  of  the  Kashif 

For  several  centuries,  Arab  caliphs  in  Cairo  governed  Egypt 
through  a  warrior  caste  called  the  Mamluks.  In  the  thirteenth  century, 
the  Mamluks  seized  control  of  the  state  and  created  a  sultanate  that 
ruled  Egypt  until  the  early  sixteenth  century.  Repeated  military  expe¬ 
ditions  weakened  Dongola,  but  the  Mamluks  failed  to  establish  direct 
rule  over  Nubia.  In  15 17  the  Turks  conquered  Egypt  and  incorporated 
the  country  into  the  Ottoman  Empire  as  a  province. 

Ottoman  forces  pursued  fleeing  Mamluks  into  Nubia,  which  the 
Mamluks  had  claimed  as  a  dependency.  Although  the  Ottomans  estab¬ 
lished  administrative  structures  in  ports  on  the  Red  Sea  coast,  they 
exerted  little  authority  over  the  interior.  Instead,  they  relied  on  mili¬ 
tary  kashif  (leaders),  many  of  whom  were  Mamluks  who  had  made 
peace  with  the  Ottomans  and  who  controlled  their  virtually  autono¬ 
mous  fiefs  as  agents  of  the  Turkish  pasha  in  Cairo.  The  rule  of  the 
kashif  lasted  300  years.  Concerned  with  little  more  than  tax  collecting 
and  slave  trading,  the  kashif  terrorized  the  population  and  fought 
among  themselves  for  title  to  territory. 

The  Funj 

At  the  same  time  that  the  Ottomans  brought  northern  Nubia  into 
their  orbit,  a  new  power,  the  Funj,  arose  farther  south  and  supplanted 
the  Christian  kingdom  of  Aiwa.  In  1504  a  Funj  leader,  Amara  Dun- 
qas,  founded  the  Black  Sultanate  at  Sinnar  (also  seen  as  Sennar  and 
Sannar)  that  eventually  became  the  keystone  of  the  Funj  Empire.  By 
the  mid-sixteenth  century,  Sinnar  controlled  Al-Gezira  and  com¬ 
manded  the  allegiance  of  vassal  states  and  tribal  districts  north  to  the 
third  cataract  and  south  to  the  swampy  grasslands  along  the  Nile. 

The  Funj  state  consisted  of  a  loose  confederation  of  sultanates  and 
dependent  tribal  chieftaincies  drawn  together  under  the  suzerainty  of 
Sinnar’s  sultan,  who  received  tribute,  levied  taxes,  and  expected  his  vas¬ 
sals  to  supply  troops  in  time  of  war.  He  also  settled  local  disorders  and 
resolved  internal  disputes  in  the  vassal  states.  The  Funj  stabilized  the 
region  and  interposed  a  military  bloc  separating  the  Arabs  in  the  north, 
the  Ethiopians  in  the  east,  and  the  non-Muslim  Africans  in  the  south. 

The  sultanate’s  economy  depended  on  the  slave  trade,  fanning, 
and  herding.  Sinnar  apportioned  tributary  areas  into  tribal  homelands, 
each  one  tenned  a  day  in  which  the  sultan  granted  the  local  popula¬ 
tion  the  right  to  use  arable  land.  The  diverse  groups  that  inhabited 
each  dar  eventually  regarded  themselves  as  units  of  tribes;  movement 
from  one  dar  to  another  entailed  a  change  in  tribal  identification. 
Tribal  distinctions  in  these  areas  in  modem  Sudan  can  be  traced  to 


12 


Historical  Setting 


this  period.  An  appointed  chieftain  governed  each  dar  according  to 
customary  law,  paid  tribute  to  the  Sinnar  sultan,  and  collected  taxes. 

In  the  mid-seventeenth  century  and  at  the  height  of  its  power,  Sin¬ 
nar  repulsed  the  northward  advance  of  the  Nilotic  Shilluk  people  up 
the  White  Nile  and  compelled  many  of  them  to  submit  to  Funj  author¬ 
ity.  After  this  victory,  Sultan  Badi  II  Abu  Duqn  (1642-81)  sought  to 
centralize  the  government  of  the  confederacy  at  Sinnar  by  creating  an 
army  of  slaves  that  would  free  Sinnar  from  dependence  on  vassal  sul¬ 
tans  for  military  assistance  and  that  would  provide  a  means  to  enforce 
the  Sinnar  sultan’s  will.  The  move  alienated  the  Funj  warrior  aristoc¬ 
racy,  who  in  1718  deposed  the  reigning  sultan  and  placed  one  of  their 
own  ranks  on  the  throne.  The  eighteenth  century  witnessed  another 
brief  period  of  expansion,  but  civil  war  and  the  demands  of  defending 
the  sultanate  had  overextended  the  warrior  society’s  resources  and 
sapped  its  strength.  In  1761  a  court  vizier,  Muhammad  Abu  al-Kay- 
lak,  who  had  led  the  Funj  army  in  wars,  staged  a  palace  coup  and  rel¬ 
egated  the  sultan  to  a  figurehead  role.  Sinnar’s  hold  over  its  vassals 
diminished,  and  by  the  early  nineteenth  century,  more  remote  areas 
ceased  to  recognize  even  the  nominal  authority  of  the  sultan. 

The  Fur 

Darfur  was  the  Fur  homeland.  Renowned  as  cavalrymen,  Fur  clans 
frequently  aided,  and  as  frequently  opposed,  their  kin,  the  Kanuri  of 
Bomo,  in  modem  Nigeria.  After  a  period  of  disorder  in  the  sixteenth 
century,  Sulayman  Solong  (1596-1637)  became  Darfur’s  first  sultan. 
He  decreed  Islam  to  be  the  official  religion;  however,  large-scale  reli¬ 
gious  conversions  did  not  occur  until  the  reign  of  Ahmad  Bakr  (1682- 
1722),  who  imported  teachers,  built  mosques,  and  compelled  his  sub¬ 
jects  to  become  Muslims.  In  the  eighteenth  century,  several  sultans 
consolidated  the  dynasty’s  hold  on  Darfur,  established  a  capital  at  Al- 
Fashir,  and  challenged  the  Funj  for  control  of  Kordofan  (also  seen  as 
Kurdufan). 

The  sultans  operated  the  slave  trade  as  a  monopoly.  They  levied  taxes 
on  traders  and  export  duties  on  slaves  sent  to  Egypt  and  took  a  share  of 
the  slaves  brought  into  Darfur.  Some  household  slaves  advanced  to 
prominent  positions  in  the  courts  of  sultans.  The  power  exercised  by 
these  slaves  provoked  a  violent  reaction  among  the  traditional  class  of 
Fur  officeholders  in  the  late  eighteenth  century.  The  rivalry  between  the 
slave  and  traditional  elites  caused  recurrent  unrest  throughout  the  nine¬ 
teenth  century.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Southern  Groups 

There  is  little  documentation  on  southern  Sudan  before  the  early 
nineteenth  century  and  the  subsequent  extension  of  slave  raiding  into 
the  South.  Information  about  the  peoples  of  this  region  before  that 
time  is  based  largely  on  oral  history.  According  to  these  traditions,  the 
Nilotic  peoples — the  Dinka,  Nuer,  Shilluk,  and  others — entered 
southern  Sudan  some  time  before  the  tenth  century.  During  the  period 
from  the  fifteenth  century  to  the  nineteenth  century,  tribal  migrations, 
largely  from  the  area  of  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  brought  these  peoples  to  their 
present  locations.  Some,  such  as  the  Shilluk,  developed  a  centralized 
monarchical  tradition  that  enabled  them  to  preserve  their  tribal  integ¬ 
rity  in  the  face  of  external  pressures  in  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth 
centuries.  Others,  including  the  Dinka  and  Nuer,  were  stateless  groups 
organized  around  local  chieftaincies.  The  non-Nilotic  Azande,  who 
entered  southwestern  Sudan  in  the  sixteenth  century,  established  the 
region’s  largest  state.  In  the  eighteenth  century,  the  militaristic  Avun- 
gara  entered  Sudan  and  quickly  imposed  their  authority  over  the 
poorly  organized  and  militarily  weaker  Azande.  Avungara  power 
remained  largely  unchallenged  until  the  arrival  of  the  British  at  the 
end  of  the  nineteenth  century. 

Geographic  barriers  protected  the  Southerners  from  Islam’s 
advance,  enabling  them  to  retain  their  cultural  and  social  heritage  and 
their  political  and  religious  institutions.  During  the  nineteenth  cen¬ 
tury,  the  slave  trade  brought  Southerners  into  closer  contact  with 
Sudanese  Arabs  and  resulted  in  a  deep  hatred  for  the  Northerners. 

The  Turkiyyah,  1821-85 

As  part  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  from  1517,  Egypt  was  divided  into 
several  provinces,  each  of  which  was  placed  under  a  Mamluk  gover¬ 
nor  responsible  to  the  pasha  in  Cairo,  who  answered  to  the  Ottoman 
government.  During  about  280  years  of  Ottoman  rule,  some  100 
pashas  succeeded  each  other.  In  the  eighteenth  century,  their  authority 
became  tenuous  as  rival  Mamluk  governors  became  the  real  power  in 
the  land.  Struggles  among  the  governors  continued  until  1798,  when 
the  French  invasion  of  Egypt  altered  the  situation.  Combined  British 
and  Turkish  military  operations  forced  the  withdrawal  of  French 
forces  in  1801.  In  1805  the  Ottomans  appointed  Muhammad  Ali  as 
Egypt’s  pasha  to  restore  order. 

Muhammad  Ali  used  10,000  Albanian  troops  provided  by  the  Otto¬ 
mans  to  purge  Egypt  of  the  Mamluks.  Some  fled  south  and,  in  1811, 
established  a  state  at  Dongola  as  a  base  for  their  slave  raiding.  In  1820 
the  sultan  of  Sinnar  informed  Muhammad  Ali  that  he  was  unable  to 


14 


Historical  Setting 


expel  the  Mamluks.  The  pasha  therefore  deployed  4,000  troops  to 
Sudan,  cleared  it  of  Mamluks,  accepted  Sinnar’s  surrender  from  the 
last  Funj  sultan,  Badi  IV,  and  reclaimed  the  territory  for  Egypt. 

The  Egyptian  occupation  of  Sudan  was  initially  disastrous.  Under 
the  new  government  established  in  1821,  known  as  the  Turkiyyah  or 
Turkish  regime,  soldiers  lived  off  the  land  and  levied  high  taxes  on  the 
population.  They  also  destroyed  many  ancient  Meroitic  pyramids 
searching  for  gold.  Furthermore,  slave  trading  increased  in  the  Funj 
heartland,  causing  many  inhabitants  to  flee  to  escape  the  traders.  Within 
a  year  of  the  pasha’s  victory,  30,000  Sudanese  slaves  were  taken  to 
Egypt  for  induction  into  the  army.  However,  so  many  perished  from 
disease  and  the  unfamiliar  climate  that  the  remaining  slaves  could  be 
used  only  in  garrisons  in  Sudan. 

The  new  regime  became  less  harsh  as  the  military  occupation 
became  more  secure.  The  Egyptians  saddled  the  country  with  a  parasitic 
bureaucracy,  however,  and  expected  the  population  to  be  self-support¬ 
ing.  Nonetheless,  farmers  and  herders  gradually  returned  to  Al-Gezira. 
The  Turkiyyah  won  the  allegiance  of  some  tribal  and  religious  leaders 
by  granting  them  a  tax  exemption.  Egyptian  soldiers,  Sudanese  slave 
soldiers,  and  mercenaries  from  various  Ottoman  domains  manned  garri¬ 
sons  in  Khartoum,  Kassala,  Al-Obeid  (also  seen  as  Al-Ubayyid),  and  at 
several  smaller  outposts.  The  Egyptians  divided  Sudan  into  provinces, 
which  were  subdivided  into  smaller  administrative  units  that  usually 
corresponded  to  tribal  territories.  In  1835  Khartoum  became  the  seat  of 
the  governor-general;  many  garrison  towns  also  developed  into  admin¬ 
istrative  centers  in  their  respective  regions.  At  the  local  level,  sheikhs 
and  traditional  tribal  chieftains  assumed  administrative  responsibilities. 

The  pasha’s  government  introduced  new  commercial  and  criminal 
codes  in  Egypt  and  Sudan  in  the  1850s,  which  were  administered  in 
secular  courts.  The  change  reduced  the  prestige  of  the  qadis ,  Islamic 
judges  whose  sharia  courts  were  confined  to  dealing  with  matters  of 
personal  status.  The  Turkiyyah  also  encouraged  a  religious  orthodoxy 
favored  in  the  Ottoman  Empire.  The  government  built  mosques  and 
staffed  religious  schools  and  courts  with  teachers  and  judges  trained  at 
Cairo’s  Al-Azhar  University.  The  government  favored  the  Khatmi- 
yyah  (see  Glossary),  a  traditional  religious  order,  because  its  leaders 
cooperated  with  the  regime.  But  Sudanese  Muslims  condemned  the 
official  orthodoxy  as  decadent  because  it  had  rejected  popular  beliefs 
and  practices. 

The  Egyptians  encouraged  economic  development  in  Sudan 
through  state  monopolies  that  exported  slaves,  ivory,  and  gum  arabic. 
In  some  areas,  tribal  land,  which  had  been  held  in  common,  became 
the  private  property  of  the  sheikhs,  who  sometimes  sold  it  to  buyers

outside  the  tribe.  But  the  slave  trade  was  the  most  profitable  business 
in  Sudan  and  was  the  focus  of  Egyptian  interests  in  the  country  until 
its  gradual  suppression  in  the  1 860s. 

Slavery  had  been  an  institution  of  Sudanese  life  throughout  history, 
but  Southern  Sudan,  where  slavery  particularly  flourished,  was  long 
considered  an  area  beyond  Cairo’s  control.  Because  Sudan  was  close 
to  Middle  Eastern  slave  markets,  it  was  a  natural  supplier  of  captives. 
Consequently,  the  slave  trade  in  the  South  intensified  in  the  nineteenth 
century  and  continued  after  the  British  had  suppressed  slaving  in  much 
of  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Annual  raids  resulted  in  the  capture  of  count¬ 
less  thousands  of  Southern  Sudanese  and  the  destruction  of  the 
region’s  economy  and  stability.  The  horrors  associated  with  the  slave 
trade  generated  European  interest  in  Sudan. 

Until  1 843  Muhammad  Ali  maintained  a  state  monopoly  on  slave 
trading.  Thereafter,  authorities  sold  licenses  to  private  traders  who 
competed  with  government  slave  raids.  In  1854  Cairo  ended  state  par¬ 
ticipation  in  the  slave  trade  and  in  1 860,  in  response  to  European  pres¬ 
sure,  prohibited  the  slave  trade  altogether.  However,  the  Egyptian  army 
failed  to  enforce  the  prohibition  against  the  private  armies  of  the  slave 
traders.  The  introduction  of  steamboats  and  firearms  enabled  slave 
traders  to  overwhelm  local  resistance  and  prompted  the  creation  of 
southern  “bush  empires”  by  Baqqara  Arabs. 

Muhammad  Ali’s  successors,  Abbas  I  (1849-54)  and  Said  (1854— 
63),  lacked  leadership  qualities  and  paid  little  attention  to  Sudan,  but 
Isma’il  (1863-79)  revitalized  Egyptian  interest  in  the  country.  In  1865 
the  Ottoman  Empire  ceded  the  Red  Sea  coast  and  its  ports  to  Egypt; 
two  years  later,  the  Ottoman  sultan  granted  Isma’il  the  title  of  khedive 
(sovereign  prince).  Egypt  organized  and  garrisoned  the  new  provinces 
of  Upper  Nile,  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  and  Equatoria  and,  in  1874,  conquered 
and  annexed  Darfur.  Isma’il  named  Europeans  to  provincial  governor¬ 
ships  and  appointed  Sudanese  to  more  responsible  government  posi¬ 
tions.  Responding  to  British  pressure,  Isma’il  took  steps  to  eliminate 
the  slave  trade  in  Northern  Sudan.  Attempts  to  build  an  army  on  the 
European  model  that  would  no  longer  depend  on  slaves  for  manpower, 
however,  caused  unrest.  Army  units  mutinied,  and  many  Sudanese 
resented  the  quartering  of  troops  among  the  civilian  population  and  the 
use  of  Sudanese  forced  labor  on  public  projects.  Efforts  to  suppress  the 
slave  trade  also  angered  the  urban  merchant  class  and  the  Baqqara 
Arabs,  who  had  grown  prosperous  by  selling  slaves. 

Isma’il  modernized  the  Sudanese  military  and  proposed  to  extend 
Egyptian  rule  into  the  southern  region.  In  1869  British  explorer  Sir 
Samuel  Baker  received  a  commission  as  governor  of  Equatoria  Prov¬ 
ince  with  orders  to  annex  all  territory  in  the  White  Nile’s  basin  and  to

suppress  the  slave  trade.  In  1874  Charles  George  Gordon,  a  British 
officer,  succeeded  Baker,  disarmed  many  slave  traders,  and  hanged 
those  who  defied  him.  By  the  time  he  became  governor-general  in 
1877,  Gordon  had  weakened  the  slave  trade  in  much  of  the  South. 

Unfortunately,  Isma’il’s  Southern  policy  lacked  consistency.  In 
1871  he  had  named  a  notorious  Arab  slave  trader,  Rahma  Mansur  al- 
Zubayr,  as  governor  of  the  newly  created  province  of  Bahr  al-Ghazal. 
Al-Zubayr  used  his  army  to  pacify  the  province  and  to  eliminate  his 
competition  in  the  slave  trade.  In  1874  he  invaded  Darfur  and  then 
offered  the  region  as  a  province  to  the  khedive.  Later  that  year,  al- 
Zubayr  defied  Cairo  when  the  khedive  attempted  to  relieve  him  of  his 
post  and  defeated  an  Egyptian  force  sent  to  oust  him.  Gordon,  after  he 
became  Sudan’s  governor-general,  ended  al-Zubayr’s  slave  trading, 
disbanded  his  army,  and  sent  him  back  to  Cairo. 

The  Mahdiyyah,  1885-98 

Sudanese  developments  during  this  period  cannot  be  understood 
without  reference  to  the  British  position  in  Egypt.  In  1869  the  Suez 
Canal  opened  and  became  Britain’s  economic  lifeline  to  India  and  the 
Far  East.  To  defend  this  waterway  and  ensure  its  profitability,  the  Brit¬ 
ish  government  sought  a  greater  role  in  Egyptian  affairs,  in  1873  sup¬ 
porting  a  program  whereby  an  Anglo-French  debt  commission  assumed 
responsibility  for  managing  Egypt’s  fiscal  affairs.  This  commission 
eventually  forced  Khedive  Isma’il  to  abdicate  in  favor  of  his  more  polit¬ 
ically  acceptable  son,  Tawfiq  (in  power,  1 879-92). 


17 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


After  Isma’il’s  removal  in  1879,  Gordon,  who  had  been  appointed 
by  him,  resigned  as  governor-general  of  Sudan  in  1880.  Gordon’s  suc¬ 
cessors  lacked  direction  from  Cairo  and  feared  the  political  turmoil  that 
had  engulfed  Egypt;  consequently,  they  failed  to  continue  the  policies 
he  had  put  into  place.  The  illegal  slave  trade  revived,  although  not  suf¬ 
ficiently  to  satisfy  the  merchants  whom  Gordon  had  put  out  of  busi¬ 
ness.  The  Sudanese  army  suffered  from  a  lack  of  resources,  and 
unemployed  soldiers  from  disbanded  units  troubled  garrison  towns. 
Tax  collectors  arbitrarily  increased  taxation. 

Into  this  troubled  atmosphere  stepped  Muhammad  Ahmad  ibn  al- 
Sayyid  Abdallah,  a  faqir  or  holy  man  who  combined  personal  magne¬ 
tism  with  religious  zealotry  and  who  was  determined  to  expel  the  Turks 
and  restore  Islam  to  its  early  purity.  The  son  of  a  Dongola  boatbuilder, 
Muhammad  Ahmad  joined  the  Sammaniyyah  order.  Later,  as  a  sheikh 
of  the  order,  he  spent  several  years  in  seclusion  and  gained  a  reputation 
as  a  mystic  and  teacher.  In  1880  he  became  a  Sammaniyyah  leader. 

Muhammad  Ahmad’s  sermons  attracted  an  increasing  number  of 
followers.  Among  them  was  Abdallahi  ibn  Muhammad,  a  Baqqara 
from  southern  Darfur,  whose  planning  capabilities  were  to  prove  of 
great  value.  Muhammad  Ahmad  revealed  himself  as  al-Mahdi  al-Mun- 
tazar  (“the  awaited  guide  in  the  right  path,”  usually  seen  as  the 
Mahdi — see  Glossary),  sent  from  God  to  redeem  the  faithful  and  pre¬ 
pare  the  way  for  the  second  coming  of  the  Prophet  ‘Isa  (Jesus).  The 
Mahdist  movement  that  he  founded  demanded  a  return  to  the  simplicity 
of  early  Islam,  abstention  from  alcohol  and  tobacco,  and  the  strict 
seclusion  of  women. 

In  May  1881,  the  Mahdi  proclaimed  a  jihad  against  the  Turkiyyah 
while  he  was  at  Aba  Island,  a  Mahdist  base  on  the  White  Nile  south  of 
Khartoum.  At  the  time,  Sudanese  authorities  dismissed  him  as  a  reli¬ 
gious  fanatic.  After  denouncing  tax  collectors,  the  Mahdi  and  his  follow¬ 
ers,  known  as  the  Ansar,  fled  to  Kordofan  to  avoid  arrest.  Once  there,  he 
gained  a  large  number  of  recruits,  especially  among  the  Baqqara,  and  the 
support  or  neutrality  of  all  religious  orders  except  the  pro-Egyptian 
Khatmiyyah.  Merchants  and  Arab  tribes  who  had  depended  on  the  slave 
trade,  along  with  the  Hadendowa  Beja,  rallied  to  the  Mahdi ’s  cause. 

Early  in  1882,  the  Ansar,  armed  with  spears  and  swords,  over¬ 
whelmed  a  7,000-man  Egyptian  force  near  Al-Obeid  and  seized  their 
rifles  and  ammunition.  The  Mahdi  then  laid  siege  to  Al-Obeid  and 
starved  it  into  submission.  The  30,000-man  Ansar  army  then  defeated 
an  8,000-man  Egyptian  relief  force  at  Sheikan.  Next,  the  Mahdi  cap¬ 
tured  Darfur  and  imprisoned  Rudolf  Slatin,  an  Austrian  in  the  khe- 
dive’s  service,  who  later  became  the  first  Egyptian-appointed  governor 
of  Darfur  Province.

Historical  Setting 


The  Ansar  advance  and  the  Beja  rising  in  the  east  imperiled  commu¬ 
nications  with  Egypt  and  threatened  to  cut  off  garrisons  at  Khartoum, 
Kassala,  Sinnar,  and  Sawakin  (also  seen  as  Suakin)  and  in  the  South. 
To  avoid  being  drawn  into  a  costly  intervention,  the  British  govern¬ 
ment  ordered  an  Egyptian  withdrawal  from  Sudan.  Gordon,  who  had 
been  reappointed  governor-general,  arranged  to  supervise  the  evacua¬ 
tion  of  Egyptian  troops  and  officials  and  all  foreigners  from  Sudan. 
However,  after  reaching  Khartoum  in  February  1884,  Gordon  realized 
that  he  could  not  extricate  the  garrisons.  As  a  result,  he  called  for  rein¬ 
forcements  from  Egypt  to  relieve  Khartoum  and  recommended  that  al- 
Zubayr,  an  old  enemy  whom  he  recognized  as  an  excellent  military 
commander,  succeed  him  so  disaffected  Sudanese  could  have  a  leader 
other  than  the  Mahdi  to  whom  they  could  rally.  London  rejected  this 
plan,  but  Gordon  argued  that  Sudan  was  essential  to  Egypt’s  security 
and  that  allowing  an  Ansar  victory  would  invite  the  movement  to 
spread  elsewhere. 

British  popular  support  for  Gordon  eventually  forced  Prime  Minis¬ 
ter  William  Gladstone  to  deploy  a  relief  force  under  Lord  Garnet 
Joseph  Wolseley’s  command.  A  “flying  column”  sent  from  Wadi 
Haifa  on  the  Egyptian  frontier  bogged  down  at  Abu  Tulayh  (com¬ 
monly  called  Abu  Klea),  where  the  Hadendowa  Beja  broke  the  British 
line.  An  advance  unit  sent  by  river  arrived  at  Khartoum  on  January  28, 
1885,  only  to  learn  that  two  days  earlier  the  Ansar  had  slaughtered  the 
garrison,  killed  Gordon,  and  delivered  his  head  to  the  Mahdi ’s  tent. 
Kassala  and  Sinnar  fell  soon  after,  and  by  late  1885  the  Ansar  had 
moved  into  the  southern  region.  In  all  Sudan,  only  Sawakin,  reinforced 
by  Indian  army  troops,  and  Wadi  Haifa  remained  in  Anglo-Egyptian 
hands  (see  fig.  5). 

The  Mahdiyyah  (Mahdist  regime)  imposed  traditional  Islamic  laws. 
Sudan’s  new  ruler  also  authorized  the  burning  of  lists  of  pedigrees  and 
books  on  law  and  theology  because  of  their  links  to  the  old  order.  The 
Mahdiyyah  is  known  as  the  first  genuine  Sudanese  nationalist  govern¬ 
ment.  The  Mahdi  maintained  that  his  movement  was  not  a  religious 
order  that  could  be  accepted  or  rejected  at  will  but  rather  a  universal 
regime  that  challenged  man  to  join  or  to  be  destroyed.  The  Mahdi  also 
convinced  his  followers  that  loyalty  to  him  was  essential  to  true 
Islamic  belief.  Moreover,  service  in  the  jihad  replaced  the  hajj,  or  pil¬ 
grimage  to  Mecca,  as  a  duty  incumbent  on  the  faithful.  Almsgiving 
became  the  tax  paid  to  the  state.  The  Mahdi  justified  his  policies  by 
claiming  he  had  received  instructions  from  God  in  visions.

The  Khalifa 

Six  months  after  Khartoum’s  capture,  the  Mahdi  died  of  typhus.  The 
task  of  establishing  and  maintaining  a  government  fell  to  three  of  his 
deputies.  Rivalry  among  these  caliphs  continued  until  1891,  when 
Abdallahi  Ibn  Muhammad,  with  the  help  primarily  of  the  Baqqara 
Arabs,  emerged  as  leader  of  the  Mahdiyyah.  Abdallahi — called  the 
Khalifa  (successor) — purged  the  Mahdiyyah  of  members  of  the  Mahdi ’s 
family  and  many  of  his  religious  disciples.  Originally,  the  Mahdiyyah 


20 


Historical  Setting 


was  a  jihadist  state,  run  like  a  military  camp.  Sharia  courts  enforced 
Islamic  law  and  the  Mahdi’s  precepts,  which  had  the  force  of  law.  After 
consolidating  his  power,  the  Khalifa  created  an  administration  and 
appointed  Ansar  (who  were  usually  Baqqara  Arabs)  as  amirs  over  each 
of  the  several  provinces.  The  Khalifa  also  ruled  over  rich  Al-Gezira. 
Although  he  failed  to  restore  this  region’s  commercial  well-being,  he 
organized  workshops  to  manufacture  ammunition  and  to  maintain  river 
steamboats. 

Regional  relations  remained  tense  throughout  much  of  the  Mahdi- 
yyah  period,  largely  because  of  the  Khalifa’s  commitment  to  jihad  as 
the  means  to  extend  his  version  of  Islam  throughout  the  world.  For 
example,  the  Khalifa  rejected  an  offer  of  an  alliance  against  the  Europe¬ 
ans  by  Ethiopia’s  Yohannes  IV,  a  Christian  monarch.  In  1888  a  60,000- 
man  Ansar  army  invaded  Ethiopia  and  penetrated  as  far  as  Gondar,  cap¬ 
turing  prisoners  and  booty.  The  Khalifa’s  refusal  to  conclude  peace 
prompted  an  Ethiopian  attack  on  Qallabat  in  March  1889;  however, 
after  Yohannes  IV  fell  in  battle,  the  Ethiopians  withdrew.  The  same 
year,  the  Khalifa’s  best  general  invaded  Egypt,  but  British-led  Egyptian 
troops  defeated  him  at  Tushki,  a  victory  that  ended  the  Ansar’s  reputa¬ 
tion  of  invincibility.  The  Belgians  prevented  the  Mahdi’s  men  from 
conquering  Equatoria,  and  in  1 893  the  Italians  repulsed  an  Ansar  attack 
at  Akordat  in  present-day  Eritrea,  forcing  the  Ansar  to  withdraw  from 
Ethiopia. 

The  Reconquest  of  Sudan 

Herbert  Kitchener  (later  Lord  Kitchener)  assumed  command  of  the 
Egyptian  army  in  1 892  and  began  preparations  for  the  reconquest  of 
Sudan.  The  British  decision  to  occupy  Sudan  resulted  in  part  from 
international  considerations.  By  the  1890s,  British,  French,  and  Bel¬ 
gian  territorial  claims  had  converged  at  the  Nile’s  headwaters.  Britain 
feared  that  other  colonial  powers  would  take  advantage  of  Sudan’s 
instability  to  acquire  Sudanese  territory  previously  annexed  to  Egypt. 
Britain  also  wished  to  secure  control  of  the  Nile’s  waters,  upon  which 
Egypt  depended,  and  to  safeguard  a  planned  irrigation  dam  at  Aswan. 

The  British  government  authorized  Kitchener  to  launch  a  campaign  in 

1895.  The  Anglo-Egyptian  Nile  Expeditionary  Force  included  25,800 
men,  8,600  of  whom  were  British;  the  remainder  belonged  to  Egyptian 
units  that  included  six  battalions  recruited  in  Southern  Sudan.  An  armed 
river  flotilla  escorted  the  force,  which  also  had  artillery  support.  The  Brit¬ 
ish  established  their  headquarters  at  Wadi  Haifa  and  extended  their 
defenses  around  Sawakin.  Kitchener  launched  the  campaign  in  March 

1 896.  In  September  he  captured  Dongola.  The  British  then  built  a  rail¬ 
road  from  Wadi  Haifa  to  Abu  Hamad,  and  a  southward  extension  parallel 


21 


Sudan :  A  Country  Study 


to  the  Nile  as  far  as  Barbar,  to  transport  military  forces.  Anglo-Egyptian 
units  fought  a  sharp  action  at  Abu  Hamad,  but  there  was  little  other  sig¬ 
nificant  resistance  until  Kitchener  reached  Atbarah  and  defeated  the 
Ansar.  Thereafter,  Kitchener’s  soldiers  marched  and  sailed  to  Omdur- 
man,  where  the  Khalifa  made  his  last  stand. 

On  September  2,  1898,  the  Khalifa  committed  his  52,000-man  army 
to  a  frontal  assault  against  the  Anglo-Egyptian  force  massed  on  the  plain 
outside  Omdurman.  The  outcome  was  never  in  doubt.  During  the  five- 
hour  battle,  about  1 1 ,000  Mahdists  died,  whereas  Anglo-Egyptian  losses 
amounted  to  48  dead  and  fewer  than  400  wounded.  Mopping-up  opera¬ 
tions  required  several  years,  but  organized  resistance  ended  when  the 
Khalifa  died  in  fighting  at  Umm  Diwaykarat,  in  Kordofan,  in  November 
1899.  Many  Sudanese  welcomed  his  demise,  as  Sudan’s  economy  had 
been  all  but  destroyed  during  his  reign  and  the  population  had  declined 
by  approximately  one-half  because  of  famine,  disease,  persecution,  and 
warfare.  Moreover,  none  of  the  country’s  traditional  institutions  or  loy¬ 
alties  remained  intact.  Mahdism  had  divided  tribes,  religious  brother¬ 
hoods  had  been  weakened,  and  orthodox  religious  leaders  had  vanished. 

In  the  meantime,  a  major  colonial  incident  had  occurred  in  Southern 
Sudan.  The  French,  in  a  race  with  the  British  to  claim  territory  in  Cen¬ 
tral  Africa,  sent  an  expeditionary  force  across  Southern  Sudan,  arriving 
on  the  Nile  at  Fashoda,  just  north  of  modem  Malakal,  in  July  1898  and 
claiming  the  Upper  Nile  region  for  France.  Following  defeat  of  the 
Mahdi’s  army,  Kitchener  and  his  Anglo-Egyptian  force  marched  south 
along  the  Nile  and  confronted  the  French,  provoking  a  major  diplo¬ 
matic  and  military  crisis.  In  the  negotiations  that  followed,  the  French 
decided  that  considerations  in  Europe  outweighed  those  in  Sudan  and 
withdrew  westward,  leaving  Britain  in  control  of  the  Upper  Nile  basin. 

The  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium,  1899-1955 

In  January  1 899,  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Agreement  restored  Egyptian 
rule  in  Sudan  but  as  part  of  the  Condominium,  or  joint  authority,  exer¬ 
cised  by  Britain  and  Egypt.  The  agreement  designated  the  territory 
south  of  the  twenty-second  parallel  as  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Sudan. 
However,  it  failed  to  clarify  the  juridical  relationship  between  the  two 
Condominium  powers  or  to  provide  a  legal  basis  for  continued  British 
presence  in  the  South.  Britain  assumed  responsibility  for  governing  the 
territory  on  behalf  of  the  khedive. 

Article  2  of  the  agreement  specified  that  “the  supreme  military  and 
civil  command  in  Sudan  shall  be  vested  in  one  officer,  termed  the  Gov¬ 
ernor-General  of  Sudan.  He  shall  be  appointed  by  Khedival  Decree  on 
the  recommendation  of  Her  Britannic  Majesty’s  Government  and  shall 
be  removed  only  by  Khedival  Decree  with  the  consent  of  Her  Britan-

nic  Majesty’s  Government.”  The  British  governor-general  reported  to 
the  Foreign  Office  through  its  resident  agent  in  Cairo.  In  practice,  how¬ 
ever,  he  exercised  extraordinary  powers  and  directed  the  Condomin¬ 
ium  government  from  Khartoum  as  if  it  were  a  colonial  administration. 
Sir  Reginald  Wingate  succeeded  Kitchener  as  governor-general  in 
1899.  In  each  province,  two  inspectors  and  several  district  commis¬ 
sioners  aided  the  governor.  Initially,  most  administrative  personnel 
were  British  army  officers  seconded  to  the  Egyptian  army.  Starting  in 
1901,  however,  British  civilian  administrators  formed  the  nucleus  of 
the  Sudan  Political  Service.  Egyptians  filled  middle-level  posts,  while 
Sudanese  gradually  acquired  lower-level  positions. 

Initially,  the  governor-general  and  provincial  governors  exercised 
great  latitude  in  governing  Sudan.  After  1910,  an  executive  council, 
whose  approval  was  required  for  all  legislation  and  budgetary  mat¬ 
ters,  assisted  the  governor-general.  This  council  included  the  inspec¬ 
tor-general;  the  civil,  legal,  and  financial  secretaries;  and  two  to  four 
other  appointed  British  officials.  The  executive  council  retained  legis¬ 
lative  authority  until  1948. 

After  restoring  authority,  the  British  dedicated  themselves  to  the  cre¬ 
ation  of  a  modem  government.  Jurists  adopted  penal  and  criminal  pro¬ 
cedural  codes  similar  to  those  in  force  in  British  India.  Commissions 
established  land-tenure  rules  and  adjusted  claims  in  dispute  because  of 
grants  made  by  successive  governments.  Land  taxes  remained  the  basic 


23 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


form  of  taxation,  and,  for  the  first  time  in  Sudan’s  history,  the  rate  of 
taxation  was  fixed.  The  1902  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  continued  the 
Ottoman  separation  of  civil  law  and  sharia,  but  it  also  created  guide¬ 
lines  for  the  operation  of  sharia  courts  as  an  autonomous  judicial  divi¬ 
sion  under  a  chief  qadi  appointed  by  the  governor-general.  Religious 
judges  and  other  sharia  court  officials  were  invariably  Egyptian. 

There  was  little  resistance  to  the  Condominium,  but  there  were  cases 
of  intertribal  warfare,  banditry,  or  revolts  of  short  duration.  For  exam¬ 
ple,  Mahdist  uprisings  occurred  in  February  1900,  1902-3,  1904,  and 
1908.  In  1916  Abdallah  al-Suhayni,  who  claimed  to  be  the  Prophet  Isa, 
launched  an  unsuccessful  jihad. 

The  problem  of  the  Condominium’s  undefined  borders  was  a  greater 
concern.  A  1902  treaty  with  Ethiopia  fixed  the  southeastern  boundary 
with  Sudan.  Seven  years  later,  an  Anglo-Belgian  treaty  determined  the 
status  of  the  Fado  Enclave  in  the  South,  establishing  a  border  with  the 
Belgian  Congo  (present-day  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo).  The 
western  boundary  proved  more  difficult  to  resolve.  The  status  of  Dar¬ 
fur,  formerly  under  Egyptian  control,  was  the  issue.  When  the  Mahdi- 
yyah  disintegrated,  Sultan  Ali  Dinar  reclaimed  Darfur’s  throne,  which 
had  been  lost  to  the  Egyptians  in  1874;  with  British  approval,  he  con¬ 
tinued  to  hold  the  throne  under  Ottoman  suzerainty  on  condition  that  he 
pay  annual  tribute  to  the  khedive.  WEen  World  War  I  broke  out,  Ali 
Dinar  proclaimed  his  loyalty  to  the  Ottoman  Empire  and  responded  to 
its  call  for  a  jihad  against  the  Allies.  Britain  deployed  a  force  against 
Ali  Dinar,  who  died  in  subsequent  fighting.  In  1 9 1 6  the  British  annexed 
Darfur  to  Sudan  and  terminated  the  Fur  sultanate. 

During  the  Condominium  period,  economic  development  occurred 
only  in  the  Nile  valley’s  settled  areas.  Among  other  things,  the  British 
extended  telegraph  and  rail  lines  to  link  key  points  in  Northern  Sudan 
but  not  to  more  remote  areas.  Port  Sudan  opened  in  1906,  replacing 
Sawakin  as  the  country’s  principal  port.  In  191 1  the  government  and  the 
Sudan  Plantations  Syndicate  launched  the  Gezira  Scheme  to  provide 
high-quality  cotton  for  Britain’s  textile  industry  (see  Agriculture,  eh.  3). 
An  irrigation  dam  near  Sinnar,  completed  in  1925,  brought  a  much  larger 
area  in  Al-Gezira  under  cultivation.  Planters  sent  cotton  by  rail  from  Sin¬ 
nar  to  Port  Sudan  for  shipment  abroad.  The  Gezira  Scheme  made  cotton 
the  mainstay  of  the  country’s  economy  and  turned  the  region  into 
Sudan’s  most  densely  populated  area.  It  also  brought  the  issue  of  the 
Nile’s  waters  to  the  fore.  In  1929  Egypt  and  Sudan,  under  British  aus¬ 
pices,  concluded  the  Nile  Waters  Agreement,  which  recognized  Egypt’s 
historical  rights  to  the  Nile’s  water,  allocated  the  annual  flow  between 
the  two  countries,  and  gave  Egyptians  the  right  to  review  future  irriga¬ 
tion  or  power  projects  on  the  Nile  or  its  tributaries  in  Sudan.

In  1922  Britain  approved  Egypt’s  declaration  of  independence.  How¬ 
ever,  the  1923  Egyptian  constitution  made  no  claim  to  Egyptian  sover¬ 
eignty  over  Sudan.  Subsequent  Anglo-Egyptian  negotiations  foundered 
on  the  Sudan  question.  Nationalists  rioted  in  Egypt  and  Sudan,  where 
some  supported  union  with  Egypt.  In  November  1924,  Sir  Lee  Stack, 
governor-general  of  Sudan  and  sirdar  (commander  in  chief,  Anglo- 
Egyptian  army),  was  assassinated  in  Cairo.  Britain  ordered  all  Egyptian 
troops,  civil  servants,  and  public  employees  withdrawn  from  Sudan.  In 
1925  the  authorities  formed  the  4,500-man  Sudan  Defence  Force  (SDF) 
under  Sudanese  officers  to  replace  Egyptian  units. 

Sudan  was  relatively  quiet  in  the  late  1920s  and  1930s.  During  this 
period,  the  colonial  government  favored  indirect  rule,  that  is,  adminis¬ 
tration  through  indigenous  leaders,  as  a  governing  system.  Traditional 
leaders  were  the  sheikhs  of  villages,  tribes,  and  districts  in  the  North  and 
tribal  chiefs  in  the  South.  The  number  of  Sudanese  recognizing  them 
and  the  degree  of  authority  they  held  varied.  The  British  first  delegated 
judicial  powers  to  sheikhs  to  enable  them  to  settle  local  disputes  and 
then  allowed  them  to  administer  local  governments  under  the  supervi¬ 
sion  of  British  district  commissioners. 

Mainstream  political  development,  however,  occurred  among  local 
leaders  and  Khartoum’s  educated  elite.  In  their  view,  indirect  rule 


25 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


prevented  the  country’s  unification,  exacerbated  tribalism  in  the 
North,  and  served  to  insulate  the  less-advanced  South  against  Arab 
influence.  Indirect  rule  also  implied  government  decentralization, 
which  alarmed  the  educated  elite  who  had  careers  in  the  central 
administration  and  envisioned  an  eventual  transfer  of  power  from 
British  colonial  authorities  to  their  class.  Although  nationalists  and 
the  Khatmiyyah  opposed  indirect  rule,  the  Ansar,  many  of  whom 
enjoyed  positions  of  local  authority,  supported  the  concept. 

Britain’s  Southern  Policy 

From  the  beginning  of  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium,  the  Brit¬ 
ish  sought  to  modernize  Sudan  by  applying  European  technology  to  its 
underdeveloped  economy  and  by  replacing  its  authoritarian  institu¬ 
tions  with  ones  that  adhered  to  liberal  English  traditions.  However, 
Southern  Sudan’s  remote  and  undeveloped  provinces — Equatoria, 
Bahr  al-Ghazal,  and  Upper  Nile — received  little  attention  until  after 
World  War  I,  except  for  efforts  to  suppress  tribal  warfare  and  the  slave 
trade.  The  British  justified  this  policy  by  claiming  that  the  South  was 
not  ready  for  exposure  to  the  modem  world.  To  allow  the  South  to 
develop  along  indigenous  lines,  the  British,  therefore,  closed  the 
region  to  outsiders,  thus  keeping  it  isolated  and  backward.  A  few  Arab 
merchants  controlled  the  region’s  limited  commercial  activities,  while 
Arab  bureaucrats  administered  whatever  laws  existed.  Christian  mis¬ 
sionaries,  who  operated  schools  and  medical  clinics,  provided  limited 
social  services. 

The  earliest  Christian  missionaries  were  the  Verona  Fathers,  a 
Roman  Catholic  religious  order  that  had  established  Southern  missions 
before  the  Mahdiyyah.  Other  missionary  groups  included  Presbyteri¬ 
ans  from  the  United  States  and  the  Anglican  Church  Missionary  Soci¬ 
ety.  The  government  eventually  subsidized  mission  schools  because 
mission  graduates  usually  gained  posts  in  the  provincial  civil  service. 
Many  Northerners  regarded  missions  as  tools  of  British  imperialism. 
Some  Southerners  attended  schools  in  British  East  Africa  (present-day 
Kenya,  Uganda,  and  Tanzania)  rather  than  in  Khartoum,  thereby  exac¬ 
erbating  the  North-South  division. 

British  authorities  treated  the  three  provinces  in  the  South  as  a  sepa¬ 
rate  region.  The  colonial  administration,  as  it  consolidated  its  position 
in  the  1920s,  detached  the  South  from  the  rest  of  Sudan  for  all  practical 
purposes.  The  period’s  Closed  Districts  Ordinance  barred  Northern 
Sudanese  from  entering  or  working  in  the  South  and  reinforced  the 
separate-development  policy.  Moreover,  the  British  gradually  replaced 
Arab  administrators  and  expelled  Arab  merchants,  thereby  severing  the 
South’s  last  economic  contacts  with  the  North.  The  colonial  adminis- 


26 


Historical  Setting 


tration  discouraged  Islam  and  Arab  customs  and  dress  but  attempted  to 
revitalize  African  customs  and  tribal  life  that  the  slave  trade  had  dis¬ 
rupted.  Finally,  a  1930  directive  stated  that  blacks  in  the  Southern  prov¬ 
inces  were  to  be  considered  as  a  people  distinct  from  Northern  Muslims 
and  that  the  region  eventually  should  be  integrated  into  Britain’s  East 
Africa  colonies. 

The  economy  suffered  in  the  South  because  of  the  region’s  isolation. 
Moreover,  there  was  a  continual  struggle  between  British  officials  in  the 
North  and  their  counterparts  in  the  South,  as  those  in  the  former  cate¬ 
gory  opposed  recommendations  that  Northern  resources  be  diverted  to 
spur  Southern  economic  development.  Personality  clashes  between 
officials  in  the  two  branches  in  the  Sudan  Political  Service  also  impeded 
the  South’s  growth.  Those  individuals  who  served  in  the  Southern  prov¬ 
inces  tended  to  be  military  officers  with  previous  Africa  experience 
who  were  on  secondment  to  the  colonial  service.  They  usually  were  dis¬ 
trustful  of  Arab  influence  and  were  committed  to  keeping  the  South 
under  British  control.  By  contrast,  Northern  officials  tended  to  be  Ara¬ 
bists  often  drawn  from  the  diplomatic  and  consular  service.  Whereas 
Northern  provincial  governors  conferred  regularly  with  the  governor- 
general  in  Khartoum,  their  three  Southern  colleagues  met  to  coordinate 
activities  with  the  governors  of  the  British  East  African  colonies. 

The  Rise  of  Sudanese  Nationalism 

Sudanese  nationalism  as  it  developed  after  World  War  I  was  an 
Arab  and  Muslim  phenomenon  based  in  the  Northern  provinces. 
Nationalists  opposed  indirect  rule  and  advocated  a  centralized  national 
government  in  Khartoum  responsible  for  both  regions.  Nationalists 
also  believed  Britain’s  Southern  policy  divided  Sudan  and  prevented 
its  unification  under  an  Arabized  and  Islamic  ruling  class.  Ironically, 
however,  a  non- Arab  led  Sudan’s  first  modem  nationalist  movement. 
In  1921  Ali  Abd  al-Latif,  a  Muslim  Dinka  and  former  army  officer, 
founded  the  United  Tribes  Society  that  called  for  an  independent 
Sudan  based  on  power  sharing  between  tribal  and  religious  leaders. 
Three  years  later,  Ali  Abd  al-Latif’s  movement,  reconstituted  as  the 
White  Flag  League,  sponsored  demonstrations  in  Khartoum.  His  arrest 
and  subsequent  exile  in  Egypt  sparked  a  Sudanese  army  battalion 
mutiny,  the  suppression  of  which  temporarily  crippled  the  nationalist 
movement. 

In  the  1930s,  nationalism  reemerged  as  educated  Sudanese  sought  to 
restrict  the  governor-general’s  power  and  to  obtain  Sudanese  participa¬ 
tion  in  the  executive  council’s  deliberations.  However,  Britain  and 
Egypt  refused  to  modify  the  Condominium  agreement.  Moreover,  the 
British  saw  themselves  as  the  protector  of  the  Sudanese  from  Egyptian 


27 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


domination.  The  nationalists  feared  that  friction  between  the  Condo¬ 
minium  powers  might  eventually  result  in  the  attachment  of  Northern 
Sudan  to  Egypt  and  of  Southern  Sudan  to  Uganda  and  Kenya.  Although 
they  settled  most  of  their  differences  in  the  1937  Treaty  of  Alliance, 
which  set  a  timetable  for  the  end  of  British  military  occupation,  Britain 
and  Egypt  failed  to  agree  on  Sudan’s  future  status. 

Nationalists  and  religious  leaders  disagreed  about  whether  Sudan 
should  seek  independence  or  union  with  Egypt.  The  Mahdi’s  son,  Abd 
al-Rahman  al-Mahdi,  supported  independence,  whereas  Ali  al-Mir- 
ghani,  the  Khatmiyyah  leader,  favored  union  with  Egypt.  Coalitions 
supported  by  each  of  these  leaders  formed  rival  wings  of  the  national¬ 
ist  movement.  Radical  nationalists  and  the  Khatmiyyah  later  created 
the  Ashigga  Party,  subsequently  renamed  the  National  Unionist  Party 
(NUP),  to  advance  the  cause  of  Sudanese-Egyptian  unification.  The 
moderates  favored  Sudanese  independence  in  cooperation  with  Brit¬ 
ain  and,  together  with  the  Ansar,  established  the  Umma  Party. 

The  Road  to  Independence 

As  World  War  II  proceeded,  Italian  forces  invaded  Sudan  in  mid- 
1940  from  Italian  East  Africa  (present-day  Ethiopia,  Eritrea,  and 
Somalia)  and  captured  Kassala,  but  the  SDF  prevented  an  advance  on 
Port  Sudan.  In  January  1941,  the  SDF,  expanded  to  20,000  troops, 
recaptured  Kassala  and  joined  the  British  offensive  that  routed  the  Ital¬ 
ians  in  Eritrea  and  liberated  Ethiopia.  Some  Sudanese  units  later  con¬ 
tributed  to  the  British  Eighth  Army’s  victory  in  North  Africa. 

In  the  postwar  years,  the  Condominium  government  made  several 
changes.  In  1942  the  Graduates’  General  Conference,  a  quasi-national¬ 
ist  movement  composed  of  educated  Sudanese,  demanded  a  pledge  of 
self-determination  after  the  war,  abolition  of  the  Closed  Districts  Ordi¬ 
nance,  an  end  to  the  separate  curriculum  in  schools  in  the  South,  and 
more  Sudanese  in  the  civil  service.  The  governor-general  rejected 
these  demands  but  agreed  to  a  government-supervised  transformation 
of  indirect  rule  into  a  modernized  system  of  local  government.  Sir 
Douglas  Newbold,  the  executive  council’s  civil  secretary,  helped 
establish  a  parliamentary  government  and  the  administrative  unifica¬ 
tion  of  North  and  South.  In  1948,  over  Egyptian  objections,  Britain 
authorized  the  partially  elected  Legislative  Assembly,  representing 
both  regions,  to  supersede  the  advisory  executive  council. 

Because  the  pro-Egyptian  NUP  boycotted  the  1948  Legislative 
Assembly  elections,  pro-independence  groups  dominated  the  assembly. 
In  1952  leaders  of  the  Umma-dominated  legislature  negotiated  the  Self- 
Determination  Agreement  with  Britain.  The  legislators  adopted  a  con¬ 
stitution  that  provided  for  a  prime  minister  and  council  of  ministers

responsible  to  a  bicameral  parliament.  The  new  government  would 
assume  responsibility  in  all  areas  except  military  and  foreign  affairs, 
which  remained  in  the  British  governor-general’s  hands.  The  Egyp¬ 
tians,  demanding  recognition  of  their  sovereignty  over  Sudan,  repudi¬ 
ated  the  Condominium  agreement  and  declared  their  reigning  monarch, 
Faruq,  king  of  Sudan  (see  fig.  6). 

After  seizing  power  in  Egypt  and  overthrowing  the  Faruq  monarchy 
in  late  1952,  Colonel  Muhammad  Naguib  resolved  the  problem  of  Egyp¬ 
tian  sovereignty  over  Sudan.  Cairo  previously  had  linked  discussions  on 
Sudan’s  status  to  an  agreement  on  the  evacuation  of  British  troops  from 
the  Suez  Canal.  Naguib  separated  the  two  issues  and  accepted  Sudanese 
self-determination.  In  February  1953,  London  and  Cairo  signed  the 
Anglo-Egyptian  Agreement,  which  allowed  for  a  three-year  transition 
period  from  Condominium  mle  to  self-government.  During  the  transition 
phase,  British  and  Egyptian  troops  would  withdraw  from  Sudan.  The 
Sudanese  then  would  decide  their  future  status  in  a  plebiscite.  Naguib’s 
concession  seemed  justified  when  parliamentary  elections  in  late  1952 
gave  a  majority  to  the  pro-Egyptian  NUP,  which  had  called  for  an  even¬ 
tual  union  with  Egypt.  In  January  1954,  a  new  government  emerged 
under  NUP  leader  Isma’il  al-Azhari. 

The  South  and  the  Unity  of  Sudan 

During  World  War  II,  some  British  colonial  officers  questioned  the 
viability  of  the  separation  of  the  Southern  provinces  from  Northern 
Sudan.  British  officials  also  had  become  more  sensitive  to  Arab  criti¬ 
cism  of  the  policy  in  the  South.  In  1946  the  Sudan  Administrative  Con¬ 
ference  determined  that  Sudan  should  be  administered  as  one  country. 
Conference  delegates  also  agreed  to  readmit  Northern  administrators  to 
posts  in  the  South,  abolish  the  trade  restrictions  imposed  under  the 
Closed  Districts  Ordinances,  and  allow  Southerners  to  work  in  the 
North.  Additionally,  Khartoum  nullified  the  prohibition  against  Muslim 
proselytizing  in  the  South  and  introduced  Arabic  in  the  South  as  the 
official  administration  language. 

Some  British  officials  in  the  South  accused  Northerners  of  unduly 
influencing  the  conferees  and  of  refusing  to  examine  reasons  for 
retaining  the  separate-development  policy.  These  officers  argued  that 
Northern  domination  of  the  South  would  result  in  a  Southern  rebel¬ 
lion.  Khartoum  convened  a  conference  at  Juba  to  resolve  these  issues 
and  to  assure  Southerners  that  a  postindependence  government  would 
safeguard  Southern  political  and  cultural  rights. 

Despite  these  promises,  many  Southerners  expressed  concern  that 
Northerners  would  overwhelm  them.  In  particular,  they  resented  the 
imposition  of  Arabic  as  the  official  language  of  administration,  which

shut  most  English-speaking  Southerners  out  of  the  civil  service,  and

pathetic  Northerners.  After  the  government  replaced  several  hundred 
colonial  officials  with  Sudanese,  only  four  of  whom  were  Southerners, 
the  Southern  elite  abandoned  hope  of  a  peaceful,  unified,  independent 
Sudan.

Historical  Setting 


Southern  hostility  toward  the  Northern  Arab  majority  surfaced  vio¬ 
lently  in  August  1955  when  Southern  army  units  mutinied  to  protest 
their  transfer  to  garrisons  under  Northern  officers.  The  rebellious 
troops  killed  several  hundred  Northerners,  including  government  offi¬ 
cials,  army  officers,  and  merchants.  Khartoum  quickly  suppressed  the 
revolt  and  executed  70  Southerners  for  sedition.  But  this  harsh  reac¬ 
tion  failed  to  pacify  the  South,  as  some  mutineers  escaped  to  remote 
areas  and  organized  resistance  to  the  Arab-dominated  government. 

Independent  Sudan 

The  al-Azhari  government,  hoping  to  promote  unity  with  Egypt,  set 
aside  the  agenda  for  self-determination  proposed  by  the  Condominium 
powers.  After  realizing  that  popular  opinion  had  shifted  against  unifica¬ 
tion  with  Egypt,  however,  al-Azhari  reversed  the  NUP’s  stand  and  sup¬ 
ported  Sudanese  independence.  In  August  1955,  he  called  for  the  speedy 
withdrawal  of  foreign  troops  and  requested  that  the  Condominium  pow¬ 
ers  sponsor  a  plebiscite  in  advance  of  the  scheduled  date.  Independence 
was  achieved,  however,  by  a  simple  declaration  adopted  unanimously 
by  the  Sudanese  parliament  on  December  19,  1955.  On  January  1, 1956, 
Sudan  became  an  independent  republic. 

The  Politics  of  Independence 

Sudan  gained  independence  without  a  permanent  constitution. 
Instead,  the  Constituent  Assembly  adopted  a  document  known  as  the 
Transitional  Constitution  that  replaced  the  governor-general  as  head 
of  state  with  a  five-member  Supreme  Commission  elected  by  a  par¬ 
liament  composed  of  an  indirectly  elected  Senate  and  a  popularly 
elected  House  of  Representatives.  The  Transitional  Constitution  also 
allocated  executive  power  to  the  prime  minister,  who  was  nominated 
by  the  House  of  Representatives  and  confirmed  in  office  by  the 
Supreme  Commission. 

Although  it  achieved  independence  without  conflict,  Sudan  inherited 
many  problems  from  the  Condominium.  One  of  the  most  important  was 
the  status  of  the  civil  service.  The  government  placed  Sudanese  in  the 
administration  and  provided  compensation  and  pensions  for  British  offi¬ 
cers  of  the  Sudan  Political  Service  who  left  the  country;  it  retained  those 
who  could  not  be  replaced,  mostly  technicians  and  teachers.  Southerners 
resented  the  replacement  of  British  administrators  in  the  South  with 
Sudanese  from  the  North.  Many  Southern  leaders,  opposed  to  violence, 
hoped  to  win  constitutional  concessions  as  a  bulwark  against  what  they 
perceived  as  Arab  imperialism.  Most  Southerners  supported  provincial 
autonomy  and  warned  that  failure  to  win  legal  concessions  would  drive 
the  South  to  rebellion.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  parliamentary  regime  introduced  plans  to  expand  the  country’s 
education,  economic,  and  transportation  sectors.  To  achieve  these 
goals,  Khartoum  needed  foreign  economic  and  technical  assistance,  to 
which  the  United  States  made  an  early  commitment.  Talks  between  the 
two  governments  began  in  1957,  and  in  July  1958  the  parliament  rati¬ 
fied  a  U.S.  aid  agreement.  Washington  hoped  this  agreement  would 
reduce  Sudan’s  reliance  on  a  one-crop  (cotton)  economy  and  facilitate 
the  development  of  the  transportation  and  communications  sectors. 

Prime  Minister  al-Azhari  formed  a  coalition  government  in  February 
1956,  but  he  alienated  the  Khatmiyyah  by  supporting  secular  govern¬ 
ment  policies.  In  June  some  Khatmiyyah  members  who  had  defected 
from  the  NUP  established  the  People’s  Democratic  Party  (PDP)  under 
al-Mirghani’s  leadership.  The  Umma  and  the  PDP  cooperated  to  bring 
down  the  al-Azhari  government.  With  support  from  the  two  parties  and 
backing  from  the  Ansar  and  the  Khatmiyyah,  Abdallah  Khalil  put 
together  a  coalition  government. 

Major  issues  confronting  Khalil’s  government  included  agreeing  on 
a  permanent  constitution,  stabilizing  the  South,  encouraging  economic 
development,  and  improving  relations  with  Egypt.  Strains  within  the 
Umma-PDP  coalition  hampered  the  government’s  ability  to  accom¬ 
plish  these  goals.  The  Umma,  for  example,  wanted  the  constitution  to 
institute  a  presidential  government  on  the  assumption  that  Abd  al-Rah- 
man  al-Mahdi  would  be  elected  the  first  president.  Consensus  was  lack¬ 
ing  about  the  country’s  economic  future.  A  poor  cotton  harvest 
followed  the  1957  bumper  cotton  crop,  which  Sudan  had  been  unable  to 
sell  at  a  good  price  in  a  glutted  market.  This  downturn  depleted  Sudan’s 
reserves  and  caused  unrest  over  government-imposed  economic  restric¬ 
tions.  The  Umma  called  for  reliance  on  increased  foreign  aid  to  over¬ 
come  these  problems  and  finance  future  development  projects.  The 
PDP,  however,  opposed  this  strategy  because  it  promoted  unacceptable 
foreign  influence  in  Sudan.  Despite  these  differences,  the  Umma-PDP 
coalition  lasted  for  the  remaining  year  of  the  parliament’s  tenure.  More¬ 
over,  after  the  parliament  adjourned,  the  two  parties  promised  to  main¬ 
tain  a  common  front  for  the  1958  elections. 

The  electorate  gave  a  plurality  in  both  houses  to  the  Umma  and  an 
overall  majority  to  the  Umma-PDP  coalition.  The  NUP,  however, 
won  nearly  one-quarter  of  the  seats.  In  the  South,  the  vote  brought  a 
rejection  of  the  men  who  had  cooperated  with  the  government  and  a 
victory  for  advocates  of  autonomy  within  a  federal  system. 

After  the  new  parliament  convened,  Khalil  again  formed  an  Umma- 
PDP  coalition  government.  Unfortunately,  factionalism,  corruption, 
and  vote  fraud  dominated  parliamentary  deliberations  at  a  time  when 
the  country  needed  decisive  action  on  the  proposed  constitution  and  the 


32 


Historical  Setting 


South’s  future.  Another  issue  that  divided  the  parliament  concerned 
Sudanese-U.S.  relations.  In  1958  Khalil  signed  a  technical  assistance 
agreement  with  the  United  States.  The  parliament  approved  the  agree¬ 
ment  despite  opposition  from  many  PDP  delegates. 

Factionalism  and  bribery  in  parliament,  coupled  with  the  govern¬ 
ment’s  inability  to  resolve  Sudan’s  many  social,  political,  and  economic 
problems,  increased  popular  disillusion  with  democratic  governance. 
Specific  complaints  included  Khartoum’s  decision  to  sell  cotton  at  a 
price  above  world  market  prices  that  resulted  in  low  sales.  Import  restric¬ 
tions  imposed  to  take  pressure  off  depleted  foreign-exchange  reserves 
caused  consternation  among  town  dwellers  accustomed  to  buying  for¬ 
eign  goods.  Moreover,  an  Egyptian  embargo  on  imports  of  cattle,  cam¬ 
els,  and  dates  caused  suffering  among  rural  Northerners.  Egypt  also 
criticized  Khalil  and  suggested  that  it  might  support  a  coup.  Meanwhile, 
reports  circulated  in  Khartoum  that  the  Umma  and  the  NUP  were  near 
agreement  on  a  new  coalition  that  would  exclude  the  PDP  and  Khalil. 

On  November  17,  1958,  the  day  parliament  was  to  convene,  Khalil 
staged  a  coup.  The  takeover  was  planned  in  conjunction  with  leading 
Umma  members  and  the  army’s  two  senior  generals,  Ibrahim  Abbud 
and  Ahmad  Abd  al-Wahab,  who  became  leaders  of  the  military  regime. 
Abbud  pledged  to  resolve  all  disputes  with  Egypt,  including  the  long¬ 
standing  problem  of  the  status  of  the  Nile.  He  abandoned  previous 
unrealistic  policies  regarding  the  sale  of  cotton  and  appointed  a  consti¬ 
tutional  commission  to  draft  a  permanent  constitution.  Abbud  main¬ 
tained,  however,  that  political  parties  only  served  as  vehicles  for 
personal  ambitions  and  that  they  would  not  be  reestablished  when  civil¬ 
ian  rule  was  restored. 

The  Abbud  Military  Government,  1958-64 

The  coup  removed  political  decision  making  from  the  control  of 
civilian  politicians.  To  rule  the  country,  Abbud  created  the  Supreme 
Council  of  the  Armed  Forces,  which  included  officers  affiliated  with 
the  Ansar,  such  as  Abd  al-Wahab,  and  the  Khatmiyyah,  such  as  Abbud. 
Even  so,  under  the  military  regime,  the  influence  of  the  Ansar  and  the 
Khatmiyyah  lessened.  The  strongest  religious  leader,  a  posthumous  son 
of  the  Mahdi  and  leader  of  the  Ansar,  Abd  al-Rahman  al-Mahdi,  died  in 
1959.  His  son  and  successor,  the  elder  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  failed  to  enjoy 
the  respect  accorded  his  father.  When  Sadiq  died  two  years  later,  Ansar 
religious  and  political  leadership  divided  between  his  brother,  Imam  al- 
Hadi  al-Mahdi,  and  his  son,  the  younger  Sadiq  al-Mahdi. 

The  regime  benefited  during  its  first  year  in  office  from  successful 
marketing  of  the  cotton  crop  and  the  settlement  of  a  dispute  with  Egypt 
over  sharing  the  Nile’s  waters.  But  despite  early  successes,  opposition 


33 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


elements  remained  powerful.  In  1959  dissident  military  officers  made 
three  attempts  to  replace  the  regime  with  a  “popular  government.” 
Although  the  coup  leaders  were  sentenced  to  prison,  discontent  within 
the  military  continued  to  plague  the  government.  The  Sudan  Commu¬ 
nist  Party  (SCP),  which  had  supported  the  coup  attempts,  gained  a  repu¬ 
tation  as  antigovemment.  To  compound  its  problems,  the  Abbud 
regime  lacked  dynamism  and  the  ability  to  stabilize  the  country.  Its  fail¬ 
ure  to  place  capable  civilian  advisers  in  senior  positions,  launch  a  credi¬ 
ble  economic  and  social  development  program,  and  gain  the  army’s 
support  encouraged  political  turbulence. 

Abbud’s  Southern  policy  proved  to  be  his  undoing.  The  govern¬ 
ment  suppressed  expressions  of  religious  and  cultural  differences  and 
bolstered  attempts  to  Arabize  society.  For  example,  in  February  1964, 
Abbud  expelled  foreign  missionaries  from  the  South  and  then  closed 
parliament  to  cut  off  outlets  for  Southern  complaints.  Southern  leaders 
had  renewed  in  1963  the  armed  struggle  against  the  government  that 
had  continued  sporadically  since  1955.  The  rebellion  was  then  spear¬ 
headed  by  guerrilla  forces  known  as  the  Anya  Nya  (snake  venom). 

Return  to  Civilian  Rule,  1964-69 

Abbud’s  inability  to  quell  growing  Southern  discontent  or  to 
improve  the  economic  and  education  sectors  led  to  protests  by  Univer¬ 
sity  of  Khartoum  students  and  faculty,  civil  servants,  and  trade  union¬ 
ists.  Attempts  to  silence  these  protests  resulted  in  the  so-called  October 
Revolution  of  1964,  which  centered  on  a  general  strike  that  spread 
throughout  the  country.  After  several  days  of  rioting  that  brought  many 
deaths,  Abbud  dissolved  the  government  and  the  Supreme  Council  of 
the  Armed  Forces.  Strike  leaders,  former  politicians,  and  army  com¬ 
manders  who  planned  the  transition  from  military  to  civilian  rule 
selected  a  nonpolitical  senior  civil  servant,  Sir  al-Khatim  al-Khalifa,  as 
prime  minister  to  head  a  transitional  government. 

The  new  civilian  regime,  which  operated  under  the  1956  Transi¬ 
tional  Constitution,  tried  to  end  political  factionalism  by  establishing 
a  coalition  government.  Although  the  new  government  allowed  all 
political  parties  to  operate,  only  five  of  15  posts  in  al-Khatim’s  cabi¬ 
net  went  to  party  politicians.  The  prime  minister  gave  two  positions 
to  nonparty  Southerners  and  the  remaining  eight  to  members  of  the 
National  Front  for  Professionals,  the  party  of  the  strike  leaders;  the 
eight  included  several  communists. 

Eventually  two  political  parties  represented  the  South.  The  Sudan 
African  National  Union  (SANU),  founded  in  1963  and  led  by  Wil¬ 
liam  Deng  and  Satunino  Lohure,  a  Roman  Catholic  priest,  operated 
among  refugee  groups  and  guerrilla  forces.  Deng’s  wing  of  SANU 


34 


Historical  Setting 


(known  locally  as  SANU-William)  and  the  second  party,  the  South¬ 
ern  Front,  coalesced  in  1965  and  agreed  to  participate  in  upcoming 
parliamentary  elections.  During  the  next  four  years,  SANU  became  a 
voice  in  parliament  for  Southern  regional  autonomy  within  a  unified 
state.  Exiled  SANU  leaders  balked  at  Deng’s  moderate  approach  and 
formed  the  Azania  Liberation  Front  based  in  Uganda. 

Anya  Nya  leaders  remained  aloof  from  political  movements.  The 
guerrillas  were  fragmented  by  ethnic  and  religious  differences.  Addi¬ 
tionally,  conflicts  surfaced  within  Anya  Nya  between  older  leaders  and 
younger,  better-educated  men  such  as  Joseph  Lagu,  a  former  Sudanese 
army  captain,  who  eventually  became  a  guerrilla  leader,  largely  because 
of  his  ability  to  obtain  arms  from  Israel. 

The  government  scheduled  national  elections  for  March  1 965  and 
announced  that  the  new  parliament’s  task  would  be  to  prepare  a  con¬ 
stitution.  The  deteriorating  security  situation  in  the  South  precluded 
elections  in  that  region,  a  situation  that  caused  disagreements  between 
political  parties  about  whether  to  hold  elections  in  the  North  or  to 
postpone  them  until  the  whole  country  could  vote.  The  PDP  and  SCP, 
both  fearful  of  losing  votes,  wanted  to  postpone  the  elections  as  did 
Southern  elements  loyal  to  Khartoum.  Their  opposition  forced  the 
government  to  resign.  The  president  of  the  reinstated  Supreme  Com¬ 
mission,  who  had  replaced  Abbud  as  chief  of  state,  announced  that  the 
elections  would  be  held  wherever  possible.  The  PDP  rejected  this 
decision  and  boycotted  the  elections. 

The  1965  election  results  were  inconclusive  and  led  in  June  to  a 
coalition  cabinet  headed  by  Umma  leader  Muhammad  Ahmad  Mahjub; 
al-Azhari,  the  NUP  leader,  became  the  Supreme  Commission’s  perma¬ 
nent  president  and  head  of  state.  The  Mahjub  government  had  two 
goals:  progress  toward  solving  the  Southern  problem  and  removal  of 
communists  from  positions  of  power.  The  army  launched  a  major  offen¬ 
sive  to  crush  the  Southern  rebellion,  in  the  process  augmenting  its  repu¬ 
tation  for  brutality.  Southerners  reported  atrocities  against  civilians, 
especially  at  Juba  and  Wau.  Sudanese  army  troops  also  burned  churches 
and  huts,  closed  schools,  and  destroyed  crops  and  cattle.  As  for  his  sec¬ 
ond  objective,  Mahjub  secured  parliamentary  approval  of  a  decree  that 
abolished  the  SCP  and  deprived  1 1  communists  of  their  seats. 

In  October  1965,  the  Umma-NUP  coalition  collapsed  because  of  a 
disagreement  over  whether  Mahjub,  as  prime  minister,  or  al-Azhari,  as 
president,  should  conduct  Sudan’s  foreign  relations.  Mahjub  remained 
in  office  until  his  resignation  in  July  1966  after  a  parliamentary  vote  of 
censure,  an  act  that  produced  a  split  in  Umma.  The  traditional  wing  led 
by  Mahjub,  under  the  spiritual  leadership  of  Imam  al-Hadi  al-Mahdi, 
opposed  the  party’s  majority.  The  latter  group  professed  loyalty  to  the 


35 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


imam’s  nephew,  the  younger  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  a  great-grandson  of  the 
Mahdi  and  the  official  Umma  leader,  who  rejected  religious  sectarian¬ 
ism.  Support  from  the  majority  Umma  and  NUP  allies  ensured  that 
Sadiq  became  prime  minister. 

Sadiq  wanted  to  foster  economic  development  and  to  make  peace 
with  the  Southern  insurgents.  He  also  wanted  to  replace  the  Supreme 
Commission  with  a  president  and  a  Southern  vice  president  and  pro¬ 
posed  autonomy  for  the  South.  But  neither  Sadiq  nor  Mahjub,  who 
returned  to  power  in  May  1967,  was  able  to  implement  meaningful 
policies  to  deal  with  Sudan’s  overriding  problems  because  of  contin¬ 
ual  political  opposition  and  maneuvering  in  parliament.  Sadiq  sur¬ 
vived  a  coup  attempt  in  December  1966  by  communists  and  a  small 
army  unit.  Another  notable  development  came  in  December  1967, 
when  the  PDP  and  NUP  formed  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP) 
under  al-Azhari’s  leadership. 

The  al-Numayri  Era,  1969-85 

On  May  25,  1969,  the  Free  Officers’  Movement  seized  power.  At 
the  conspiracy’s  core  were  nine  officers  led  by  Colonel  Ja’far  al- 
Numayri,  who  had  been  implicated  in  plots  against  the  Abbud  regime. 
Al-Numayri ’s  coup  preempted  plots  by  other  groups,  most  of  which 
involved  armed  factions  supported  by  the  SCP,  Arab  nationalists,  or 
conservative  religious  groups.  He  justified  the  coup  on  the  grounds 
that  civilian  politicians  had  paralyzed  the  decision-making  process  and 
had  failed  to  resolve  the  country’s  economic  and  regional  problems 
and  to  devise  a  permanent  constitution. 

The  Revolutionary  Command  Council 

The  coup  leaders  constituted  themselves  as  the  10-member  Revolu¬ 
tionary  Command  Council  (RCC),  which  possessed  collective  execu¬ 
tive  authority  under  al-Numayri ’s  chairmanship.  The  RCC  established 
a  “democratic  republic”  dedicated  to  advancing  “Sudanese  socialism.” 
The  RCC  also  suspended  of  the  Transitional  Constitution,  abolished  all 
government  institutions,  banned  political  parties,  and  nationalized 
many  industries,  businesses,  and  banks.  Furthermore,  al-Numayri 
arrested  63  civilian  politicians  and  forcibly  retired  senior  army  officers. 

Babikir  Awadallah,  the  former  chief  justice  who  had  been  privy  to 
the  coup,  was  appointed  prime  minister  and  presided  over  a  21 -mem¬ 
ber  cabinet  that  included  only  three  RCC  officers,  among  them  its 
chairman,  al-Numayri,  who  also  served  as  defense  minister.  The  cabi¬ 
net’s  other  military  members  held  the  portfolios  for  internal  security 
and  communications.  Nine  members  of  the  Awadallah  regime  were 
allegedly  communists,  including  one  of  the  two  Southerners  in  the

cabinet,  John  Garang  de  Mabior,  minister  of  supply  and  later  minister 
for  Southern  affairs.  Others  identified  themselves  as  Marxists.  Since 
the  RCC  lacked  political  and  administrative  experience,  the  commu¬ 
nists  played  a  significant  role  in  shaping  its  policies  and  programs.  In 
November  al-Numayri  replaced  Awadallah  as  prime  minister.  How¬ 
ever,  Awadallah  remained  RCC  deputy  chairman  and  foreign  minister 
and  an  important  link  with  leftist  elements. 

Conservative  forces,  led  by  the  Ansar,  posed  the  greatest  threat  to 
the  RCC.  Imam  al-Hadi  al-Mahdi  had  withdrawn  to  the  Aba  Island 
Mahdist  stronghold  in  the  Nile,  near  Kosti,  in  the  belief  that  the  govern¬ 
ment  had  decided  to  strike  at  the  Ansar  movement.  The  imam  had 
demanded  a  democratic  government,  the  exclusion  of  communists 
from  power,  and  an  end  to  RCC  rule.  In  March  1970,  hostile  Ansar 
crowds  prevented  al-Numayri  from  visiting  the  imam.  Fighting  subse¬ 
quently  erupted  between  government  forces  and  as  many  as  30,000 
Ansar.  When  the  Ansar  ignored  an  ultimatum  to  surrender,  army  units 
attacked  Aba  Island,  killing  some  3,000  people.  The  imam  escaped 
only  to  be  killed  while  attempting  to  cross  the  border  into  Ethiopia.  The 
government  exiled  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  to  Egypt  to  prevent  him  from  suc¬ 
ceeding  his  uncle  as  head  of  the  Ansar. 

After  neutralizing  the  conservative  opposition,  the  RCC  consolidated 
its  position  with  the  intent  of  phasing  out  communist  participation  in  the 
government.  The  SCP’s  orthodox  wing,  led  by  party  secretary-general 
Abd  al-Khaliq  Mahjub,  demanded  a  popular-front  government  with 
communists  participating  as  equal  partners.  By  contrast,  the  National 
Communist  wing  supported  cooperation  with  the  government.  Soon 
after  the  Aba  Island  incident,  al-Numayri  deported  Mahjub;  when  he 
returned  illegally,  al-Numayri  arrested  him.  In  March  1971,  al-Numayri 
placed  communist-influenced  trade  unions  under  government  control 
and  banned  communist-affiliated  student,  women’s,  and  professional 
organizations.  Additionally,  he  announced  plans  to  form  a  national 
political  movement  to  be  called  the  Sudan  Socialist  Union  (SSU), 
which  would  control  all  political  parties,  including  the  SCR  After  this 
speech,  the  RCC  arrested  the  members  of  the  SCP’s  central  committee 
and  other  leading  communists. 

The  SCP,  however,  retained  a  covert  organization  that  launched  a 
coup  against  al-Numayri  on  July  19,  1971,  led  by  Major  Hisham  al- 
Atta.  Three  days  later,  loyal  army  units  rescued  al-Numayri  and  arrested 
al-Atta  and  his  confederates.  Al-Numayri  blamed  the  SCP  for  the  coup 
and  arrested  hundreds  of  communists  and  dissident  military  officers. 
The  government  subsequently  executed  some  of  these  individuals  and 
imprisoned  many  others.  Having  survived  the  SCP-inspired  coup,  al- 
Numayri  then  reaffirmed  his  commitment  to  establishing  a  socialist

state.  A  provisional  constitution,  published  in  August  1971,  described 
Sudan  as  a  “socialist  democracy”  and  provided  for  a  presidential  form 
of  government  to  replace  the  RCC.  A  plebiscite  the  following  month 
elected  al-Numayri  to  a  six-year  term  as  president. 

The  Southern  Problem 

The  origins  of  the  civil  war  in  the  South  date  to  the  1950s.  On 
August  18,  1955,  the  Equatoria  Corps,  a  military  unit  composed  of 
Southerners,  mutinied  at  Torit.  Rather  than  surrender  to  Sudanese 
authorities,  many  mutineers  disappeared  into  hiding  with  their  weap¬ 
ons,  marking  the  beginning  of  the  first  war  in  the  South.  By  the  late 
1960s,  the  war  had  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  about  500,000  people. 
Several  hundred  thousand  more  Southerners  hid  in  the  forests  or 
escaped  to  refugee  camps  in  neighboring  countries. 

By  1 969  the  rebels  had  developed  foreign  contacts  to  obtain  weap¬ 
ons  and  supplies.  Israel,  for  example,  trained  Anya  Nya  recruits  and 
shipped  weapons  via  Ethiopia  and  Uganda  to  the  rebels.  Anya  Nya 
also  purchased  arms  from  Congolese  rebels  and  international  arms 
dealers  with  monies  collected  in  the  South  and  from  among  Southern 
Sudanese  exile  communities  in  the  Middle  East,  Western  Europe,  and 
North  America.  The  rebels  also  captured  amis,  equipment,  and  sup¬ 
plies  from  government  troops.  Militarily,  the  5,000- 10,000-man  Anya 
Nya  controlled  much  of  the  countryside  in  the  South  and  operated 
from  remote  camps,  while  government  forces  occupied  the  region’s 
major  towns.  However,  rebel  units  were  too  small  and  scattered  to  be 
highly  effective  in  any  single  area. 

Government  operations  against  the  rebels  declined  after  the  1969 
coup.  However,  when  negotiations  failed  to  result  in  a  settlement,  Khar¬ 
toum  increased  troop  strength  in  the  South  to  about  12,000  in  1969  and 
intensified  military  activity.  Although  the  Soviet  Union  and  Sudan  con¬ 
cluded  an  arms  agreement  worth  between  US$100  million  and  US$150 
million  in  August  1968,  by  May  1969  there  had  been  no  deliveries  of 
T-55  tanks,  armored  personnel  carriers,  or  aircraft.  However,  Sudan 
obtained  some  Soviet-manufactured  weapons  from  Egypt.  By  late 
1969,  the  Soviet  Union  had  shipped  unknown  quantities  of  85mm  anti¬ 
aircraft  guns,  1 6  MiG-2 1  s,  and  five  Antonov-24  transport  aircraft.  Dur¬ 
ing  the  next  two  years,  the  Soviet  Union  delivered  an  impressive  array 
of  equipment,  including  T-54,  T-55,  T-56,  and  T-59  tanks;  and  BTR- 
40  and  BTR-152  light  armored  vehicles  (see  Foreign  Military  Assis¬ 
tance,  ch.  5). 

In  1971  Joseph  Lagu,  who  had  become  leader  of  Southern  forces, 
proclaimed  the  creation  of  the  Southern  Sudan  Liberation  Movement 
(SSLM).  Anya  Nya  leaders  united  behind  him,  and  nearly  all  exiled 


38 


Historical  Setting 


Southern  politicians  supported  the  SSLM.  Although  the  SSLM  created  a 
governing  infrastructure  in  many  areas,  real  power  remained  with  Anya 
Nya,  with  Lagu  at  its  head.  Al-Numayri  hoped  to  end  the  war  in  the 
South  by  granting  regional  self-government  and  undertaking  economic 
development  there.  The  two  sides  held  talks  in  Addis  Ababa,  and  on 
March  27,  1972,  Khartoum  and  the  SSLM  signed  the  Addis  Ababa 
Agreement.  This  agreement  guaranteed  autonomy  for  a  Southern  region 
composed  of  three  provinces,  Equatoria,  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  and  Upper 
Nile,  under  a  regional  president  appointed  by  the  national  president  on 
the  recommendation  of  an  elected  Southern  Regional  Assembly.  The 
High  Executive  Council,  or  cabinet,  named  by  the  regional  president 
was  responsible  for  governing  the  region,  except  that  the  national  gov¬ 
ernment  retained  authority  over  such  areas  as  defense,  foreign  affairs, 
currency  and  finance,  and  economic  and  social  planning.  Southerners, 
including  Anya  Nya  veterans,  would  be  incorporated  into  a  12,000-man 
Southern  command  of  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces  (SAF)  under  equal 
numbers  of  Northern  and  Southern  officers.  The  accords  also  recog¬ 
nized  Arabic  as  Sudan’s  official  language  and  English  as  the  South’s 
principal  language. 

Although  many  SSLM  leaders  opposed  the  settlement,  Lagu  approved 
its  terms  and  agreed  to  a  cease-fire.  Khartoum  issued  a  decree  legalizing 
the  agreement  and  creating  an  international  commission  to  ensure  the 
well-being  of  refugees  returning  to  the  South;  Khartoum  also  announced 
an  amnesty,  retroactive  to  1955.  March  27  was  thereafter  celebrated  as 
National  Unity  Day. 

Political  Developments 

After  the  settlement  in  the  South,  al-Numayri  attempted  to  mend 
fences  with  Muslim  religious  groups  in  the  North  through  such  mea¬ 
sures  as  administrative  decentralization,  popular  with  the  Ansar,  who 
favored  rural  over  urban  areas;  reaffirmation  of  Islam’s  special  position 
in  the  country;  recognition  of  sharia  as  the  source  of  all  legislation;  and 
the  freeing  of  some  members  of  religious  orders.  However,  reconcilia¬ 
tion  with  conservative  groups  eluded  al-Numayri.  They  organized  out¬ 
side  Sudan  under  Sadiq  al-Mahdi’s  leadership  and  in  1974  coalesced 
into  a  new  movement  called  the  National  Front.  Among  their  members 
were  the  NUP  and  the  Islamic  Charter  Front,  then  the  political  arm  of 
the  Muslim  Brotherhood  (see  Glossary),  an  Islamic  activist  movement. 

Al-Numayri  formed  a  Constituent  Assembly  in  August  1972,  in  order 
to  draft  a  permanent  constitution,  which  it  had  done  by  the  following 
May.  The  document  provided  for  a  continuation  of  presidential  govern¬ 
ment,  recognized  the  SSU  as  the  only  authorized  political  organization, 
and  supported  regional  autonomy  for  the  South.  Although  it  cited  Islam 


39 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


as  Sudan’s  official  religion,  Christianity  was  recognized  as  the  faith  of  a 
large  number  of  Sudanese  citizens  (see  Christianity,  ch.  2).  In  May  1974, 
a  People’s  Assembly  of  250  representatives  was  seated  on  the  basis  of 
the  new  constitution. 

There  was  discontent  with  al-Numayri’s  policies  and  increased  mili¬ 
tary  influence  in  government  despite  these  measures.  The  tension  esca¬ 
lated  as  a  result  of  food  shortages  and  the  settlement  in  the  South, 
which  many  Muslim  conservatives  regarded  as  a  surrender.  Unsuccess¬ 
ful  coup  attempts  occurred  in  1973  and  1974  and  again  in  July  1976, 
the  latter  Ansar-inspired  and  supported  by  the  conservative  opposition 
in  the  National  Front.  Government  soldiers  killed  more  than  700  rebels 
in  Khartoum  in  response  and  arrested  scores  of  dissidents,  including 
many  prominent  religious  leaders.  This  unrest  notwithstanding,  in  1977 
Sudanese  voters  reelected  al-Numayri  for  a  second  six-year  term  as 
president. 

National  Reconciliation 

Al-Numayri  and  his  opponents  adopted  more  conciliatory  policies 
following  the  1976  coup  attempt.  In  early  1977,  al-Numayri  and  Sadiq 
al-Mahdi  met  in  Port  Sudan  and  signed  an  eight-point  agreement  that 
readmitted  the  opposition  to  national  life  in  return  for  the  National 
Front’s  dissolution.  The  agreement  also  restored  civil  liberties,  freed 
political  prisoners,  reaffirmed  Sudan’s  nonaligned  foreign  policy,  and 
promised  to  reform  local  government.  In  keeping  with  this  “national 
reconciliation,”  the  government  released  about  1,000  detainees  and 
granted  an  amnesty  to  Sadiq,  who  renounced  multiparty  politics  and 
urged  his  followers  to  work  within  the  regime’s  one-party  system.  The 
SSU  then  admitted  former  National  Front  supporters  into  its  ranks. 

Returning  exiles  from  the  old  Umma  Party,  DUP,  and  Muslim 
Brotherhood  were  permitted  to  stand  as  independent  candidates  in 
national  elections  held  in  February  1978,  winning  140  of  304  seats  in 
the  People’s  Assembly.  Their  success  led  to  disillusion  and  weakened 
discipline  among  SSU  deputies.  The  end  of  the  SSU’s  political  monop¬ 
oly,  coupled  with  rampant  corruption  at  all  government  levels,  under¬ 
mined  al-Numayri’s  ability  to  govern  Sudan.  Al-Numayri  adopted  a 
more  dictatorial  leadership  style  to  preserve  his  regime.  He  ordered  the 
State  Security  Organisation  to  imprison  thousands  of  opponents  and 
dissidents  without  trial  and  dismissed  or  transferred  independent- 
minded  ministers  and  senior  military  officers,  selecting  replacements 
on  the  basis  of  loyalty  rather  than  competence  (see  Internal  Security 
Agencies,  ch.  5).  In  June  1983,  al-Numayri  sought  to  counter  the 
South’s  growing  political  power  by  redividing  it  into  its  former  constit¬ 
uent  provinces  of  Equatoria,  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  and  Upper  Nile;  he  had 


40 


Historical  Setting 


suspended  the  Southern  Regional  Assembly  almost  two  years  earlier. 
The  Southern-based  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement  (SPLM) 
and  its  military  wing,  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Army  (SPLA), 
which  emerged  in  mid- 1983,  unsuccessfully  opposed  this  redivision 
and  called  for  the  creation  of  a  new  united  Sudan. 

Al-Numayri  proclaimed  sharia  as  the  basis  of  the  Sudanese  legal 
system  in  September  1983.  His  decrees,  known  as  the  September 
Laws,  were  bitterly  resented  by  secularized  Muslims  and  the  non- 
Muslim  Southerners.  The  SPLM  denounced  sharia  and  the  executions 
and  amputations  ordered  by  religious  courts.  Meanwhile,  the  security 
situation  in  the  South  had  deteriorated  so  much  that  by  the  end  of 
1983  virtual  civil  war  had  resumed.  In  Khartoum,  a  general  strike  in 
early  1985  over  rising  food,  gasoline,  and  transport  costs  paralyzed 
the  country. 

Economic  Developments  since  Independence 

The  30  years  since  independence  had  witnessed  several  notable  eco¬ 
nomic  developments  by  the  mid-1980s.  In  November  1959,  Egypt  and 
Sudan  signed  the  Agreement  for  the  Full  Utilization  of  the  Nile  Waters 
(Nile  Waters  Treaty).  The  treaty  increased  Sudan’s  share  of  the  Nile’s 
flow  over  that  allocated  in  the  1929  Nile  Waters  Agreement  (4  billion 
cubic  meters/year — bcm/yr)  to  18.5  bcm/yr,  and  increased  Egypt’s 
allotment  from  48  bcm/yr  to  55.5  bcm/yr.  It  cleared  the  way  for  con¬ 
struction  of  a  new  dam  at  Aswan  and  provided  for  Egyptian  compen¬ 
sation  to  Sudan  for  flooding  in  Nubia  caused  by  the  Aswan  High  Dam 
and  for  the  relocation  of  the  affected  population.  Negotiated  without 
the  participation  of  other  riparian  states,  the  treaty  has  led  to  years  of 
cooperative  activities  and  discussions  among  all  Nile  basin  states  over 
the  equitable  sharing  of  the  Nile’s  waters  since  it  was  signed. 

In  the  Al-Gezira  area,  more  land  had  been  brought  under  cultivation 
during  the  1950s  and  early  1960s,  aided  by  the  new  agreement  between 
Egypt  and  Sudan  that  increased  Sudan’s  allotment  of  the  Nile’s  waters. 
During  the  same  period,  new  irrigation  projects  relying  on  pumped 
water  were  established,  mostly  on  the  Blue  Nile.  Beginning  in  the  early 
1 960s,  Nubians  displaced  by  construction  of  the  Aswan  High  Dam  in 
Egypt  were  resettled  west  of  Kassala  on  land  watered  by  a  new  dam  on 
the  Atbarah,  where  they  cultivated  cotton,  peanuts,  and  sugarcane.  In 
1966  a  large  dam  was  constructed  at  Roseires  on  the  Blue  Nile,  initially 
for  irrigation  and  later  for  electricity  generation.  In  the  mid-1970s,  two 
large-scale  projects  for  growing  and  processing  sugar  were  developed 
on  the  White  Nile  close  to  Kosti.  One,  the  Kananah  Sugar  Project,  was 
among  the  largest  such  operations  in  the  world.  Another  large-scale 
undertaking  was  the  Jonglei  Canal  (see  Glossary),  designed  to  increase 


41 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


the  northward  flow  of  the  White  Nile  by  diverting  part  of  the  Nile’s 
water  around  the  Al-Sudd  swamp. 

Exploration  for  petroleum  deposits  began  in  1959  along  the  Red 
Sea  littoral.  No  oil  was  found,  but  a  refinery  operating  on  imported 
petroleum  was  built  at  Port  Sudan  in  1964.  Exploration  resumed  in  the 
mid-1970s  and  met  with  greater  success  in  what  are  today  the  states  of 
Upper  Nile  and  West  Kordofan.  By  the  early  1980s,  the  region  was 
producing  more  than  12,000  barrels  per  day,  and  there  were  proposals 
for  a  pipeline  and  a  second  refinery  at  Kosti.  All  exploration  and  pro¬ 
duction  ceased  in  1984,  however,  after  attacks  by  Southern  guerrillas 
on  the  oil  installations.  Similar  attacks  brought  construction  of  the  Jon- 
glei  Canal  to  a  halt  as  well. 

The  Transitional  Military  Council 

The  combination  of  the  South’s  redivision,  the  introduction  of  sha¬ 
ria  throughout  the  country,  the  renewed  civil  war,  and  growing  eco¬ 
nomic  problems — the  same  issues  that  would  bedevil  successive 
governments — all  contributed  to  al-Numayri’s  downfall.  On  April  6, 
1985,  a  group  of  military  officers  led  by  Lieutenant  General  Abd  al- 
Rahman  Siwar  al-Dhahab  overthrew  al-Numayri,  who  took  refuge  in 
Egypt.  Three  days  later,  al-Dhahab  authorized  fonnation  of  a  15 -man 
Transitional  Military  Council  (TMC)  to  rule  Sudan.  The  TMC  sus¬ 
pended  the  constitution;  dissolved  the  SSU,  secret  police,  parliament, 
and  regional  assemblies;  dismissed  regional  governors  and  their  min¬ 
isters;  and  released  hundreds  of  political  detainees.  Al-Dhahab  also 
promised  to  negotiate  an  end  to  the  civil  war  and  to  relinquish  power 
to  a  civilian  government  within  12  months.  Although  the  general  pop¬ 
ulace  welcomed  and  supported  the  new  regime,  it  soon  became  evi¬ 
dent  that  al-Dhahab  lacked  the  skills  to  resolve  Sudan’s  economic 
problems,  restore  peace  to  the  South,  and  establish  national  unity. 

Sudan’s  economy  was  in  shambles  by  the  time  al-Dhahab  seized 
power,  and  its  international  debt  totaled  some  US$9  billion.  Agricul¬ 
tural  and  industrial  projects  funded  by  the  International  Monetary 
Fund  (IMF)  and  the  World  Bank  remained  in  the  planning  stages. 
Most  factories  operated  at  less  than  50  percent  of  capacity,  while  agri¬ 
cultural  output  had  dropped  by  50  percent  since  1960.  Moreover,  fam¬ 
ine  threatened  Southern  and  Western  Sudan. 

The  TMC  failed  to  resolve  these  problems.  The  al-Dhahab  govern¬ 
ment  refused  to  accept  IMF  economic  austerity  measures,  resulting  in 
an  IMF  declaration  of  Sudan’s  bankruptcy.  The  TMC  also  failed  to 
secure  alternative  international  investment,  to  control  a  soaring  rate  of 
inflation,  or  to  obtain  international  food  aid  to  prevent  an  estimated 
400,000  to  500,000  deaths.  Although  al-Dhahab  attempted  concilia- 


42 


Historical  Setting 


tion  with  the  South,  his  refusal  to  repeal  sharia  negated  his  overtures 
and  convinced  SPLM  leader  John  Garang  that  the  central  government 
still  sought  to  subjugate  the  South.  Even  so,  the  two  sides  signed  the 
Koka  Dam  Declaration  in  Ethiopia  in  March  1986,  which  called  for  a 
Sudan  “free  from  racism,  tribalism,  sectarianism,  and  all  causes  of  dis¬ 
crimination  and  disparity,”  repeal  of  sharia,  and  a  constitutional  con¬ 
ference.  Despite  general  acceptance  of  the  declaration,  al-Dhahab 
deferred  its  implementation  because  of  opposition  from  Muslim  con¬ 
servatives  over  repeal  of  sharia.  Meanwhile,  fighting  between  the 
SPLA  and  government  forces  continued  in  the  South. 

The  TMC  proved  similarly  unable  to  foster  a  national  political  con¬ 
sensus.  In  April  1985,  negotiations  between  the  TMC  and  the  Alliance 
of  Professional  and  Trade  Unions  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  a 
civilian  cabinet.  Although  it  contained  three  Southerners  who  belonged 
to  the  Southern  Sudanese  Political  Association,  the  cabinet  failed  to 
win  the  loyalty  of  most  Southerners,  who  believed  the  TMC  was  only 
continuing  the  failed  policies  of  the  deposed  al-Numayri.  The  multi¬ 
plicity  of  political  parties  added  to  the  difficulties.  In  the  aftermath  of 
al-Numayri’s  overthrow,  approximately  40  parties  registered  with  the 
TMC  and  announced  their  intention  to  participate  in  national  politics. 
They  ranged  from  those  committed  to  revolutionary  socialism  to  those 
that  supported  Islamism.  Of  the  latter,  the  National  Islamic  Front 
(NIF),  led  by  Hassan  Abdallah  al-Turabi,  had  succeeded  the  Islamic 
Charter  Front  as  the  main  vehicle  for  the  Muslim  Brotherhood’s  politi¬ 
cal  aspirations.  Policy  disagreements  over  sharia,  the  civil  war,  and  the 
country’s  future  direction  made  for  a  confused  political  scene. 

In  this  troubled  atmosphere,  al-Dhahab  sanctioned  the  promised 
April  1986  general  election,  which  the  authorities  spread  over  a  12-day 
period  and  postponed  in  37  constituencies  in  the  South  because  of  the 
civil  war.  Sadiq  al-Mahdi’s  Umma  Party  won  99  seats,  while  the  DUP, 
led  now  by  Khatmiyyah  leader  Muhammad  Uthman  al-Mirghani, 
gained  64  seats,  and  al-Turabi ’s  NIF  obtained  51  seats.  Regional  politi¬ 
cal  parties  from  the  South,  the  Nuba  Mountains,  and  the  Red  Sea  Hills 
won  lesser  numbers  of  seats.  The  SCP  and  other  radical  parties  failed  to 
score  any  significant  victories. 

Sadiq  al-Mahdi  and  Coalition  Governments 

Sadiq  al-Mahdi  formed  a  coalition  government  in  June  1986,  with 
the  Umma,  DUP,  NIF,  and  four  parties  from  the  South.  Unfortunately, 
Sadiq  proved  to  be  a  weak  leader  and  incapable  of  governing  Sudan. 
Party  factionalism,  corruption,  personal  rivalries,  scandals,  and  politi¬ 
cal  instability  characterized  his  government.  After  less  than  a  year  in 
office,  Sadiq  dismissed  the  government  because  it  had  failed  to  draft  a

new  penal  code  to  replace  sharia,  reach  an  agreement  with  the  IMF, 
end  the  civil  war  in  the  South,  or  attract  remittances  from  Sudanese 
expatriates. 

To  retain  the  support  of  the  DUP  and  the  Southern  political  parties, 
Sadiq  formed  another  in  a  series  of  ineffective  coalition  governments, 
all  of  which  suffered  from  the  same  overriding  weaknesses  as  the  first. 
Al-Mirghani  of  the  DUP  and  al-Turabi  of  the  NIF  were  deeply 
involved  in  the  political  maneuverings  surrounding  these  govern¬ 
ments.  As  a  prime  example,  in  November  1988  al-Mirghani  and  the 
SPLM  leadership  on  their  own  signed  an  agreement  in  Addis  Ababa 
that  included  provisions  for  a  cease-fire  in  the  South,  freezing  of  sha¬ 
ria,  lifting  the  state  of  emergency,  and  abolition  of  all  foreign  political 
and  military  pacts.  The  parties  to  the  agreement  also  proposed  to  con¬ 
vene  a  constitutional  conference  to  decide  Sudan’s  political  future. 
The  NIF  opposed  this  agreement  because  of  its  stand  on  sharia.  When 
the  government  opposed  the  agreement,  the  DUP  withdrew  from  the 
coalition.  Senior  military  officers  then  presented  Sadiq  with  an  ultima¬ 
tum  demanding  that  he  make  the  coalition  government  more  represen¬ 
tative  and  that  he  announce  terms  for  ending  the  civil  war. 

Responding  to  this  pressure,  Sadiq  dissolved  the  government  on 
March  11,  1989,  and  created  a  new  coalition  that  included  Umma,  the 
DUP,  and  representatives  of  Southern  parties  and  trade  unions.  The 
NIF  refused  to  join  the  government  because  it  was  not  committed  to 
enforcing  sharia.  Sadiq  claimed  that  his  new  government  was  commit¬ 
ted  to  ending  the  civil  war  through  implementation  of  the  November 
1988  DUP-SPLM  agreement.  He  also  promised  to  provide  food  relief 
to  famine  areas,  reduce  the  government’s  international  debt,  and  build 
a  national  political  consensus.  His  inability  to  deliver  on  these  prom¬ 
ises  eventually  caused  his  downfall. 

Umar  al-Bashir  and  the  Islamist  Revolution 

On  June  30,  1989,  a  group  of  15  military  officers,  including  Colonel 
(later  Lieutenant  General)  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al-Bashir,  overthrew 
the  Sadiq  government  and  established  the  National  Salvation  Revolu¬ 
tionary  Command  Council  (NSRCC)  to  rule  Sudan.  The  NSRCC 
banned  all  political  parties;  abolished  the  constitution,  national  assem¬ 
bly,  and  trade  unions;  and  arrested  government  leaders  and  more  than 
100  military  officers.  Al-Bashir ’s  long-term  agenda  included  fomenting 
an  Islamist  revolution,  distancing  Sudan  from  its  traditional  Western 
allies  and  enhancing  relations  with  Arab  countries,  ending  the  war 
against  the  SPLA,  and  improving  the  country’s  economy  by  developing 
the  oil  sector.  Several  Arab  countries,  including  Chad,  Egypt,  Libya,  the 


44 


Historical  Setting 


People’s  Democratic  Republic  of  Yemen,  and  Saudi  Arabia,  immedi¬ 
ately  recognized  the  new  government. 

Al-Bashir  moved  quickly  and  decisively  against  real  and  imagined 
opponents.  Among  other  actions,  he  purged  the  armed  forces,  police, 
judiciary,  and  civil  service  and  dismissed  from  government  posts  sup¬ 
porters  of  Umma  and  the  DUP,  both  of  which  opposed  the  government’s 
Islamist  policies.  He  also  detained  many  opposition  politicians,  includ¬ 
ing  Sadiq  al-Mahdi.  In  March  1990,  security  forces  arrested  57  people, 
including  army  officers  and  civilians,  for  attempting  a  coup  d’etat.  On 
April  23,  al-Bashir  ordered  the  execution  of  28  army  officers  for  plotting 
a  coup;  in  April  1991,  another  20  military  officers  were  executed  for 
similar  reasons.  The  government  also  authorized  the  police  to  arrest  sus¬ 
pected  subversives  without  a  warrant  and  to  hold  them  in  security  build¬ 
ings  known  as  “ghost  houses,”  without  filing  criminal  charges  against 
them.  The  use  of  torture  was  commonplace. 

Such  tactics,  however,  failed  to  extinguish  popular  dissent.  In 
November  1990,  trade  unions  and  students  staged  antigovemment  dem¬ 
onstrations  in  Khartoum,  Wad  Madani,  Atbarah,  and  Al-Obeid.  In  mid- 
1993,  because  of  their  opposition  to  al-Bashir,  the  authorities  arrested  21 
Umma  activists,  including  three  former  ministers,  preachers  at  Ansari 
mosques,  and  the  Ansar  Affairs  Organization’s  director  of  guidance.  In 
October  1993,  there  were  three  days  of  rioting  in  Omdurman,  Wad 
Madani,  and  Al-Obeid  because  of  food  shortages  and  price  rises.  The 
following  month,  University  of  Khartoum  students  protested  over 
alleged  vote  rigging  that  resulted  in  supporters  of  the  NIF  winning  all  40 
seats  in  the  students’  union.  Nonetheless,  despite  this  unrest  and  grow¬ 
ing  international  criticism  of  its  human-rights  record,  the  government 
refused  to  moderate  its  policies. 

In  early  1992,  the  NSRCC  announced  its  intention  to  disband.  To 
govern  the  country  until  national  elections  could  be  held,  it  created  two 
temporary  bodies,  a  Transitional  National  Council  (TNC)  and  a  300- 
member  Transitional  National  Assembly  (TNA).  Both  were  dominated 
by  personalities  and  policies  of  the  National  Congress  Party  (NCP),  suc¬ 
cessor  to  the  NIF  as  of  1991.  On  October  16,  1993,  the  NSRCC  offi¬ 
cially  dissolved  itself  amidst  much  fanfare  about  its  intention  to  make 
reforms  aimed  at  preparing  the  country  for  presidential,  legislative,  and 
local  elections  to  be  organized  on  the  basis  of  the  nine  states  into  which 
the  NSRCC  had  divided  the  country  in  1991  (see  fig.  7).  Al-Bashir,  who 
had  been  NSRCC  chairman,  became  Sudan’s  president,  while  his  dep¬ 
uty,  Major  General  Zubayr  Muhammad  Salih,  became  vice  president. 
The  new  government  announced  that  its  policies  would  continue  to  be 
based  on  the  “Islamic  cultural  scheme”  and  that  “commitment”  to  Islam 
was  obligatory.  This  institutional  arrangement  continued  until  March

1996,  when  national  elections  transformed  the  TNA  into  a  400-member 
National  Assembly  and  al-Bashir  was  elected  to  a  five-year  term  as 
president. 

The  regime  took  its  first  major  step  toward  Islamization  on  Decem¬ 
ber  31,  1990,  when  it  imposed  a  version  of  sharia  on  Northern  Sudan 
that  was  more  stringent  and  more  rigorously  enforced  than  that  decreed 
by  President  al-Numayri  in  September  1983.  Islamic  courts,  composed 
largely  of  NIF  members,  administered  and  enforced  sharia  laws.  A  new 
penal  code  introduced  in  1991  explicitly  mandated  the  death  penalty  for

anyone  who  advocated  apostasy.  The  government  also  restricted  the 
rights  of  women  in  public  life  and  employment.  During  1989-91,  for 
example,  newly  enacted  laws  prohibited  women  from  selling  food  or  tea 
after  5  p.m.  and  from  working  in  coffeehouses  and  cafeterias.  Women 
also  were  required  to  sit  in  the  rear  of  buses  to  avoid  sitting  in  front  of 
men.  The  Popular  Police  Force  Act  (1992)  gave  organizations  such  as 
the  Public  Order  Police,  Popular  Police  Forces,  Popular  Committees, 
and  the  Guardians  of  Morality  civic  group  authority  to  punish  women 
for  such  offenses  as  “scandalous  conduct”  or  “immodest  dress.”  The  fol¬ 
lowing  year,  Khartoum  issued  Decree  155,  which  authorized  execution 
of  anyone  who  operated  a  group  of  two  or  more  persons  for  the  procure¬ 
ment  of  prostitutes. 

The  government  also  discriminated  against  non-Muslims  by  exclud¬ 
ing  them  from  senior-level  positions  in  the  civil  service,  judiciary,  and 
military.  Clerics  subjected  non-Muslim  Sudanese  to  traditional  hudud 
(see  Glossary)  criminal  punishments.  Protests  by  the  Sudan  Council  of 
Churches  and  the  Sudan  Catholic  Bishops’  Conference  against  these 
and  other  discriminatory  practices  fell  on  deaf  ears.  In  late  1991,  two 
bishops  and  two  diocesan  administrators  issued  a  pastoral  letter  that 
encouraged  Christian  resistance  to  Islamization.  The  following  Janu¬ 
ary,  Sudanese  authorities,  claiming  that  the  letter  posed  a  threat  to 
national  security  and  could  cause  civil  strife,  confiscated  all  copies  of 
the  letter  and  subjected  several  bishops,  including  Archbishop  of  Khar¬ 
toum  Gabriel  Wako,  to  harsh  interrogations.  Khartoum  also  impeded 
humanitarian  relief  deliveries  to  some  non-Muslim  populations  and 
expelled  all  Christian  missionaries  from  southern  Kordofan. 

There  was  a  significant  deterioration  in  Sudan’s  human-rights  record 
throughout  the  mid-  and  late  1990s,  a  development  that  prompted  a 
series  of  reports  from  the  United  Nations  (UN),  Amnesty  International, 
Human  Rights  Watch,  and  African  Rights.  However,  some  allegations 
against  Khartoum,  concerning  the  use  of  chemical  weapons  and  wide¬ 
spread  slave  raids,  proved  to  be  false  or  greatly  misrepresented  in  the 
Western  media.  Ironically,  there  was  little  criticism  of  the  SPLA  and 
other  rebels  groups  that  also  committed  widespread  human-rights  vio¬ 
lations,  such  as  the  execution  of  government  troops  who  had  surren¬ 
dered  and  the  abduction  or  enslavement  of  young  boys  to  serve  as 
porters  for  the  SPLA. 

In  October  1994,  Gaspar  Biro,  the  UN  representative  for  Sudan,  issued 
a  report  that  accused  Khartoum  of  bombing  civilian  targets  in  the  South, 
recruiting  child  soldiers,  and  interfering  with  food-relief  shipments.  The 
regime  rejected  the  report  as  “outrageous,  repetitive,  untruthful  and  politi¬ 
cized.”  In  December  the  UN  adopted  a  resolution  that  censured  Khartoum 
for  its  many  abuses.  In  January  1995,  Amnesty  International  launched  a 


47 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


six-month  campaign  against  Sudan’s  poor  human-rights  record.  Among 
other  things,  Khartoum  was  accused  of  purging  its  opponents  in  the  civil 
service,  trade  unions,  judiciary,  and  educational  institutions.  Amnesty 
International  also  accused  rebel  groups  in  the  South,  including  the  SPLA, 
of  committing  human-rights  violations.  Al-Bashir  rejected  an  Amnesty 
International  recommendation  to  establish  an  international  civilian  moni¬ 
toring  group. 

In  mid- 1995,  the  London-based  African  Rights  organization  reported 
that  the  SAF,  frequently  supported  by  the  Popular  Defense  Forces,  the 
military  wing  of  the  NIF,  repeatedly  attacked  civilians  and  moved  many 
of  them  into  protected  villages  (critics  claimed  they  were  concentration 
camps)  to  isolate  them  from  the  SPLA.  African  Rights  also  drew  atten¬ 
tion  to  the  fact  that  government  forces  destroyed  food  stocks  and  ani¬ 
mals;  raped  women;  and  kidnapped,  tortured,  or  killed  anyone  suspected 
of  disloyalty.  According  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  State’s  2000  annual 
report  on  human  rights,  the  SPLM/A  also  had  a  record  of  committing 
extrajudicial  killings,  beatings,  rape,  arbitrary  detention,  and  forced  con¬ 
scription.  The  report  alleged  that  SPLM/A  officials  were  guilty  of,  or 
complicit  in,  theft  of  property  of  nongovernmental  organizations  and 
UN  agencies  operating  in  the  South. 

The  most  controversial  aspect  of  Khartoum’s  human-rights  record 
concerned  reports  of  its  involvement  in  slave  raids  as  an  extension  of  its 
war  policy  in  the  South.  By  the  1 990s,  there  were  widespread  accounts 
of  armed  men  identified  as  government  forces  raiding  and  kidnapping 
Southerners,  especially  women  and  children,  who  were  marched  north 
and  absorbed  into  Arab  households  or  sold  to  traders.  Such  reports 
brought  international  condemnation  and  calls  for  action.  In  October 
1999,  Zurich-based  Christian  Solidarity  International  (CSI)  announced 
that  since  1995  it  had  bought  the  freedom  of  15,447  “slaves”  from  Arab 
middlemen  for  US$50  per  fugitive.  CSI’s  activities  and  those  of  similar 
organizations  elicited  criticism  from  several  sources.  Others  alleged  that 
CSI  was  merely  rewarding  kidnappers  for  their  illicit  activities,  while  a 
Canadian  report  in  February  2000  maintained  that  CSI  allowed  the 
SPLA  to  use  fraudulent  slave  redemptions  to  raise  money  for  buying 
arms  and  ammunition.  The  al-Bashir  government  characterized  the 
alleged  “slaving”  as  merely  intertribal  scuffling  and  refused  to  cooperate 
with  calls  for  international  inquiries. 

There  was  no  indication  by  the  turn  of  the  century  that  the  regime, 
the  SPLA,  or  other  rebel  groups  were  prepared  to  take  steps  to  cease 
their  abuse  of  the  population  in  the  South.  Human-rights  issues  in 
Sudan  also  remained  a  highly  contentious  and  politicized  subject  for 
most  Western  countries. 

Umma,  the  DUP,  trade  unions,  and  the  secular  professional  elite 
remained  active  in  the  capital  despite  the  regime’s  harsh  tactics.  Outside 


48 


Historical  Setting 


Khartoum,  the  Christian  peoples  of  the  Nuba  Mountains  constituted  the 
strongest  opposition.  Nonetheless,  divisions  and  endless  squabbling 
among  these  groups  ensured  that  none  of  them  posed  a  serious  threat  to 
the  government.  Some  1 1  political  parties,  5 1  professional  unions,  and 
5 1  trade  unions  signed  the  National  Democratic  Alliance  (NDA)  char¬ 
ter  on  October  21,  1989.  Throughout  the  mid-1990s,  the  NDA  tried 
unsuccessfully  to  persuade  its  members  to  put  aside  their  differences, 
adopt  a  common  strategy  to  overthrow  al-Bashir,  and  establish  a  demo¬ 
cratic  government.  On  December  5,  1994,  Eritrea  severed  diplomatic 
relations  with  Sudan  because  of  Khartoum’s  support  of  Eritrean  Islamic 
Jihad,  an  opposition  group,  and  subsequently  invited  the  NDA  to  move 
its  headquarters  into  the  former  Sudanese  embassy  in  Asmara.  Despite 
Eritrean  training,  the  NDA  failed  to  improve  its  military  capabilities, 
even  though  the  SPLA  had  joined  the  alliance. 

Al-Bashir  continued  in  the  late  1 990s  to  rely  on  divide-and-mle  tac¬ 
tics  against  the  opposition,  especially  the  SPLA.  On  April  21,  1997,  for 
example,  Khartoum  signed  a  peace  agreement  with  six  Southern  fac¬ 
tions  opposed  to  the  SPLA  and  its  leader,  John  Garang  (the  South  Sudan 
Independence  Movement,  SPLA-Bahr  al-Ghazal  Group,  Equatoria 
Defense  Force,  Independence  of  Bor  Group,  Independence  Movement 
for  Southern  Sudan,  and  Union  of  Sudan  African  Parties).  On  Septem¬ 
ber  20,  1997,  Lam  Akol,  leader  of  the  SPLA-United  faction,  also  signed 
a  peace  accord  with  Khartoum. 

Al-Bashir  attended  to  the  moribund  petroleum  sector,  enlisting  for¬ 
eign  assistance  for  its  revival.  In  1995  he  concluded  agreements  with 
the  People’s  Republic  of  China  and  with  Qatar  for  further  development 
of  Sudan’s  oil  fields,  and  proposals  were  floated  to  upgrade  the  refinery 
at  Port  Sudan  and  to  build  a  pipeline  from  the  Southern  oil  fields  to  that 
facility,  despite  continuing  insecurity  in  the  South.  Both  projects  were 
underway  by  the  late  1 990s,  as  was  a  new  refinery  at  Al-Jayli,  north  of 
Khartoum,  which  was  being  constructed  by  the  China  National  Petro¬ 
leum  Company  (see  Petroleum,  eh.  3).  The  pipeline,  more  than  1,600 
kilometers  long,  was  completed  in  August  1999,  largely  with  financing 
from  Argentine,  British,  Canadian,  Chinese,  and  Malaysian  companies. 
Petroleum  exports  via  the  new  pipeline  began  in  late  2000.  Improve¬ 
ments  such  as  these  drew  protests  from  international  human-rights 
groups,  which  alleged  that  increased  oil  revenues  would  help  finance 
the  civil  war  in  the  South.  In  an  effort  to  promote  trade,  particularly 
with  Sudan’s  Arab  neighbors,  a  free-trade  zone  was  established  in  2000 
along  part  of  the  Red  Sea  coast  (see  Manufacturing,  eh.  3). 

As  he  neared  the  end  of  a  decade  in  power,  al-Bashir  remained  head 
of  state  and  in  command  of  the  armed  forces,  but  the  ideological  under¬ 
pinnings  of  the  regime  and  the  driving  force  of  the  Islamist  movement 
clearly  lay  with  al-Turabi,  the  speaker  of  the  National  Assembly,  and 


49 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


his  sympathizers.  The  relationship  between  the  two  leaders  gradually 
evolved  into  rivalry  for  control  of  the  state  and  its  institutions  (see  The 
Al-Bashir  Era,  eh.  4).  On  March  28,  1998,  the  National  Assembly  rati¬ 
fied  a  draft  constitution  stating  that  sharia  law  and  custom  constituted 
the  basis  of  the  country’s  legal  system  and  declaring  Sudan  a  25-state 
federation.  Then  on  May  8,  some  96  percent  of  Sudanese  who  voted 
endorsed  the  constitution,  which  al-Bashir  signed  into  law  on  June  30, 
exactly  nine  years  after  his  coup  d’etat.  The  SPLM  rejected  the  docu¬ 
ment  because  of  its  “religious  nature”  and  because  it  defined  Sudan  as  a 
federation  rather  than  a  confederation. 

Elections  for  the  National  Assembly  and  the  presidency  were 
scheduled  for  December  1999,  and  in  late  1998  al-Bashir  signed  the 
Political  Association  Act,  which  allegedly  restored  multiparty  politics. 
Umma  and  the  DUP  dismissed  the  legislation  as  a  sham  and  called  for 
the  establishment  of  a  transitional  government  of  national  unity.  Even 
so,  in  early  1999  the  registration  of  political  parties  began,  and  eventu¬ 
ally  Umma,  the  DUP,  and  a  host  of  other  organizations  such  as  the 
Muslim  Brotherhood,  Socialist  Popular  Party,  Islamic  Movement,  and 
Sudanese  National  Party,  signed  up. 

Al-Bashir  declared  a  three-month  state  of  emergency  on  December 
13,  1999,  in  response  to  a  proposed  constitutional  amendment  allowing 
the  National  Assembly  to  remove  the  president,  a  proposal  sponsored 
by  al-Turabi  and  his  legislative  allies.  Al-Bashir  saw  the  amendment  as 
intended  to  ensure  al-Turabi ’s  complete  ascendance — an  initiative  he 
preempted  with  the  emergency  decree.  It  enabled  al-Bashir  to  dissolve 
the  National  Assembly,  thereby  eliminating  al-Turabi  from  any  role  in 
the  government,  although  he  retained  much  influence  throughout  the 
country,  and  to  postpone  the  national  elections.  In  response  to  unrest 
among  al-Turabi ’s  followers,  al-Bashir  extended  the  state  of  emer¬ 
gency  through  2000  in  a  successful  effort  to  consolidate  his  standing  as 
the  unquestioned  master  of  Sudan. 

Hassan  al-Turabi  and  the  Islamization  of  Sudan 

Hassan  al-Turabi,  a  British-  and  French-educated  Islamic  scholar, 
was  the  driving  force  behind  the  NIF  and  the  chief  architect  of  the 
Islamization  of  Sudan’s  government  and  society.  He  was  also  tolerant 
toward  international  terrorism.  Throughout  the  1989-99  period,  his 
relationship  with  al-Bashir  vacillated  between  confrontation  and  coop¬ 
eration.  Shortly  after  seizing  power,  al-Bashir  jailed  al-Turabi,  who  had 
been  active  in  the  Muslim  Brotherhood,  for  six  months  and  then  placed 
him  under  house  arrest.  In  mid- 1991,  al-Turabi  regained  his  freedom 
after  declaring  his  willingness  to  work  with  the  al-Bashir  regime.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Al-Turabi  spent  much  time  between  1992  and  1994  promoting  his 
Islamist  ideas  in  several  countries,  including  Afghanistan,  Britain,  Eri¬ 
trea,  Italy,  Qatar,  and  the  United  States.  His  speeches  and  interviews 
generated  considerable  interest  in  the  Arab  world  but  inflamed  passions 
in  Western  countries  that  opposed  his  support  of  radical  Islamist  doc¬ 
trines.  Critics  frequently  abused  al-Turabi,  verbally  and  otherwise,  for 
his  views.  On  May  25,  1992,  for  example,  a  Sudanese  Muslim  named 
Hashim  Badr  al-Din,  who  was  a  karate  expert,  attacked  al-Turabi  at 
Canada’s  Ottawa  Airport.  He  spent  several  weeks  recovering  from  his 
injuries  in  a  Canadian  hospital  and  a  clinic  in  Switzerland.  For  the  next 
six  months,  al-Turabi  was  rarely  seen  in  public.  However,  in  November 
1993,  he  traveled  to  Afghanistan  to  mediate  conflicts  between  Afghan 
warlords. 

Al-Turabi  established  the  Popular  Arab  and  Islamic  Conference 
(PAIC)  in  Khartoum  in  April  1991  and  became  its  secretary-general. 
Some  300  delegates  from  45  nations  attended  the  inaugural  conference 
and  urged  all  Muslims  to  oppose  U.S.  involvement  in  the  1990-91  Gulf 
War  and  attempts  to  isolate  Sudan,  to  facilitate  the  Islamic  revolution, 
and  to  coordinate  anti-imperialist  activities.  The  al-Bashir  government 
called  PAIC’s  formation  “the  most  significant  event  since  the  collapse  of 
the  Caliphate”  and  an  alternative  to  the  endless  bickering  between  the 
League  of  Arab  States  (Arab  League)  and  the  Organization  of  the  Islamic 
Conference  (OIC).  PAIC  held  its  second  conference  in  Khartoum,  during 
December  2-4,  1993,  with  about  450  delegates  from  60  countries  in 
attendance.  Among  other  things,  they  discussed  ways  to  contend  with 
“American  hegemony”  and  to  marginalize  the  OIC.  Approximately  300 
delegates  from  80  countries  attended  PAIC’s  third  meeting  in  Khartoum, 
which  ran  from  March  30  to  April  2,  1995.  Al-Turabi  caused  a  contro¬ 
versy  by  claiming  that  the  “typical  ascetic  religious  clergy  is  no  longer 
viable  in  modem  times.”  He  also  accused  Amnesty  International  of  being 
in  the  pay  of  British  intelligence  and  recommended  the  creation  of  an 
Islamic  human-rights  organization  and  the  adoption  of  an  Islamic 
human-rights  charter.  The  three  PAIC  meetings  represented  the  apex  of 
al-Turabi ’s  efforts  to  unify  and  radicalize  the  Islamic  world.  By  the  late 
1990s,  however,  PAIC  had  become  moribund,  and  al-Turabi’s  influence 
throughout  the  Arab  world  had  waned. 

At  the  same  time,  the  al-Turabi-al-Bashir  relationship  became 
increasingly  strained  as  the  two  sought  to  marginalize  one  another.  An 
unexpected  tragedy  occurred  on  February  12,  1998,  when  an  aircraft 
crashed  on  landing  near  Nasir  in  Upper  Nile  and  killed  First  Vice  Presi¬ 
dent  Zubayr  Muhammad  Salih  and  seven  other  senior  government  offi¬ 
cials.  This  accident  prompted  the  largest  cabinet  reshuffle  since  al-Bashir 
had  seized  power.  As  a  result,  al-Turabi  became  even  more  of  a  political

force  in  the  government  as  NIF  loyalists  gained  1 6  out  of  24  ministerial 
portfolios.  He  tried  to  use  this  influence  to  reduce  the  power  of  the  presi¬ 
dency  by  urging  moribund  parties  such  as  the  DUP  and  Umma,  both  of 
which  opposed  al-Bashir,  to  rejoin  the  political  process.  Throughout 
1999  al-Turabi  succeeded  in  maintaining  control  over  the  mling  party 
and  continued  his  efforts  to  marginalize  al-Bashir.  The  political  maneu¬ 
vering  between  the  two  men  reached  its  climax  in  December  when  al- 
Turabi  arranged  for  an  assembly  vote  that  would  have  amended  the  con¬ 
stitution  to  allow  al-Bashir ’s  removal  by  a  two-thirds  vote.  On  December 
12,  al-Bashir,  who  still  enjoyed  the  support  of  the  SAF  and  the  security 
forces,  ended  this  scheming  by  dismissing  al-Turabi  from  his  post  as 
speaker,  dissolving  the  assembly,  and  declaring  a  state  of  emergency. 

Sudan  and  International  Terrorism 

The  most  controversial  aspect  of  Sudan’s  Islamization  experiment 
concerned  its  links  to  international  terrorism.  Even  before  al-Bashir 
seized  power,  there  were  terrorist  incidents  in  Sudan,  two  of  which 
involved  U.S.  government  employees.  On  March  1,  1973,  the  Black 
September  Palestinian  terrorist  group  murdered  U.S.  ambassador  Cleo 
A.  Noel,  Jr.,  U.S.  deputy  chief  of  mission  George  Curtis  Moore,  and 
Belgian  charge  d’affaires  Guy  Eid.  Sudanese  authorities  arrested  the 
terrorists  and  tried  them  on  murder  charges,  but,  in  June  1974,  released 
them  to  the  custody  of  the  Egyptian  government.  On  April  16,  1986, 
gunmen  from  the  Libyan  Embassy  in  Khartoum  shot  and  wounded  a 
U.S.  Embassy  employee.  Two  years  later,  the  Abu  Nidal  organization 
bombed  Khartoum’s  Acropole  Hotel  and  Sudan  Club.  No  Americans 
were  injured. 

Sudan’s  links  with  international  terrorism  expanded  significantly 
after  al-Bashir  and  the  NIF  came  to  power  in  1989.  Al-Turabi  culti¬ 
vated  relations  with  the  Saudi  terrorist  Osama  bin  Laden  in  hopes  of 
securing  funding  for  his  scheme  to  spread  political  Islam  throughout 
the  world.  In  1991  bin  Laden,  his  family,  and  scores  of  fighters  from 
Afghanistan  arrived  in  Khartoum.  Among  his  other  activities,  bin 
Laden  established  several  companies  in  the  agricultural,  financial, 
road  construction,  and  tanning  sectors.  None  were  successful  because 
bin  Laden  used  them  primarily  as  conduits  to  move  cash  to  finance 
terrorist  activities. 

Sudanese  authorities  arrested  Ilich  Ramirez  Sanchez,  a  Venezuelan 
terrorist  known  as  “Carlos  the  Jackal,”  in  August  1 994  and  turned  him 
over  to  French  security  officials.  Khartoum  maintained  that  the  Carlos 
incident  proved  that  it  had  no  links  to  international  terrorism,  an  asser¬ 
tion  disputed  by  the  United  States.  Meanwhile,  Sudan  and  France 
denied  the  turnover  involved  any  trade-offs.  However,  relations  between 


53 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


the  two  countries  improved  dramatically,  especially  with  regard  to  eco¬ 
nomic  and  military  cooperation.  Examples  of  the  changed  climate  came 
when  Paris  financed  the  purchase  of  four  Airbus  planes  for  Sudan  Air¬ 
ways  and  interceded  on  Sudan’s  behalf  to  improve  its  relations  with  the 
IMF  and  the  UN.  France  also  provided  military  aid  to  Sudan  for  use 
against  the  SPLA.  In  October  1994,  Sudan  established  a  council  on  eco¬ 
nomic  affairs  in  Paris.  In  late  1995  and  early  1996,  several  French  com¬ 
panies  signed  mining  and  telecommunications  contracts  with  Sudan. 

The  next  manifestation  of  Sudan’s  links  with  international  terrorism 
occurred  on  June  26,  1995,  when  Islamist  gunmen  tried  to  assassinate 
President  Husni  Mubarak  of  Egypt  as  he  arrived  in  Addis  Ababa  to 
attend  the  opening  of  an  Organization  of  African  Unity  (OAU;  now 
African  Union)  summit.  Although  the  assassins  fired  a  dozen  rounds  at 
Mubarak’s  limousine,  he  was  unharmed  in  the  attack  and  immediately 
returned  to  Cairo,  but  the  fracas  claimed  the  lives  of  two  Ethiopian 
police  officers  and  two  assailants,  while  several  people  sustained  inju¬ 
ries.  Three  days  later,  the  Ethiopian  police  identified  the  chief  suspect  as 
Seraj  Mohammed  Husayn,  a  Sudanese.  They  speculated  that  the  other 
assassins  were  Egyptian  Islamic  militants,  who  were  subsequently 
arrested  or  killed  in  Addis  Ababa  or  who  escaped  to  Sudan.  Mubarak 
angrily  accused  Khartoum  generally  and  al-Turabi  specifically  of  hav¬ 
ing  masterminded  the  assassination  plot,  but  he  doubted  that  there  had 
been  direct  Sudanese  government  involvement.  Al-Bashir  expressed 
regret  for  the  incident,  but  both  he  and  al-Turabi  denied  any  Sudanese 
involvement  in  the  attack. 

Sudanese-Egyptian  relations  quickly  deteriorated  as  a  result  of  the 
incident.  On  June  27,  there  were  clashes  between  Sudanese  and  Egyp¬ 
tian  forces  in  the  disputed  Hala’ib  Triangle  that  claimed  the  lives  of  two 
Sudanese  (see  Egypt,  eh.  4).  The  following  day,  Mubarak  expelled  70 
Sudanese  police  from  jointly  guarded  posts  in  the  Hala’ib  Triangle.  On 
June  29,  he  warned  that  there  could  be  reprisals  against  the  “band  of 
criminals”  in  power  in  Sudan,  a  threat  that  brought  warnings  to  prepare 
for  war  in  Khartoum.  On  July  1,  nonetheless,  a  senior  Egyptian  foreign 
ministry  official  announced  that  Egypt  would  not  attack  Sudan  but 
would  punish  the  country  by  nonmilitary  means  should  investigators 
find  a  link  between  Khartoum  and  the  failed  attack  in  Addis  Ababa. 

The  international  community  also  took  action  against  the  al-Bashir 
regime  for  its  involvement  in  the  incident.  On  September  11,  1995,  the 
OAU  passed  a  resolution  demanding  that  Sudan  turn  over  three  sus¬ 
pects  implicated  in  the  attempted  assassination.  When  Khartoum 
refused  to  comply  with  the  resolution,  the  UN  Security  Council 
adopted  a  resolution  on  January  31,  1996,  that  encouraged  Sudan  to 
implement  the  OAU  resolution  within  60  days.  In  April  the  Security 


54 


Historical  Setting 


Council  responded  to  Khartoum’s  continued  refusal  to  honor  these  res¬ 
olutions  by  adopting  another  resolution  that  directed  Sudan  to  extradite 
the  three  suspects  and  to  sever  its  links  with  international  terrorism. 
Additionally,  the  UN  asked  member  and  nonmember  states  to  reduce 
staff  levels  at  Sudanese  diplomatic  missions  and  consular  posts  and  to 
restrict  the  movement  of  Sudanese  government  personnel  in  their  coun¬ 
tries.  Other  penalties  included  restricting  the  entry  into  or  transit 
through  their  territories  of  Sudanese  government  and  military  officials, 
and  calling  on  all  international  and  regional  organizations  to  refrain 
from  holding  conferences  in  Sudan.  In  July  the  Security  Council  autho¬ 
rized  the  imposition  of  an  air  embargo  to  compel  Khartoum  to  hand 
over  the  three  suspects,  but  this  proposal  was  eventually  scuttled  on 
humanitarian  grounds.  Meanwhile,  Sudanese-Ethiopian  relations 
remained  strained  until  November  1999,  when  the  two  countries  agreed 
to  reactivate  their  joint  commission  of  ministers. 

A  proliferation  of  U.S.  intelligence  reports  in  1990-96  indicated  that 
Khartoum  planned  to  attack  U.S.  targets  in  Sudan  and  elsewhere.  As  a 
result,  in  1 993  the  United  States  placed  Sudan  on  its  list  of  state  spon¬ 
sors  of  terrorism  and  evacuated  dependents  of  U.S.  embassy  personnel 
from  Khartoum.  In  1996  U.S.  intelligence  reported  that  Sudan  wanted 
to  kill  Anthony  Lake,  then  adviser  for  national-security  affairs  to  Presi¬ 
dent  William  J.  Clinton.  Eventually  in  1998,  the  New  York  Times 
reported  that  the  U.S.  Central  Intelligence  Agency  had  withdrawn  more 
than  1 00  of  its  reports  that  had  linked  Sudan  with  the  Lake  assassina¬ 
tion  plot  and  international  terrorism  because  its  source  had  fabricated 
the  information. 

Operatives  of  the  international  terrorist  organization  al-Qaeda 
bombed  the  U.S.  embassies  in  Nairobi  and  Dar  es  Salaam  on  August  7, 
1998.  Two  days  later,  Sudan’s  foreign  minister,  Mustafa  Uthman 
Isma’il,  announced  that  his  government  had  approved  U.S.  requests  to 
use  its  airspace  to  evacuate  American  diplomats  and  citizens  from  Kenya 
and  to  provide  emergency  aid  to  survivors  of  the  bombings.  However, 
despite  this  aid  and  the  absence  of  any  credible  evidence  linking  Sudan 
to  the  attacks,  Washington  accused  Khartoum  of  being  involved  in  the 
bombings. 

On  August  20,  the  United  States  launched  a  cmise-missile  strike 
against  Al-Shifa  Pharmaceutical  Industries  in  Khartoum  North.  President 
Clinton  and  other  senior  U.S.  officials  justified  the  action  by  claiming 
that  the  factory  had  been  producing  Empta,  a  precursor  to  the  VX  nerve 
gas;  that  Osama  bin  Laden  either  owned  or  had  invested  in  the  plant;  that 
Al-Shifa  did  not  produce  any  medicine  or  drugs;  that  the  factory  was  a 
high-security  facility  guarded  by  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces;  and  that  Iraq 
had  shipped  weapons  of  mass  destruction  to  Sudan.  The  international 


55 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


press  was  highly  skeptical  of  these  assertions.  The  Observer  (London) 
reported  that  the  allegations  were  “a  catalogue  of  U.S.  misinformation, 
glaring  omissions  and  intelligence  errors  about  the  function  of  the  plant.” 
The  Washington  Post ,  New  York  Times ,  and  Times  (London)  expressed 
similar  doubts.  In  October,  a  survey  team,  headed  by  Thomas  Tullius, 
chairman  of  Boston  University’s  chemistry  department,  reported  that  it 
had  found  no  traces  of  chemical  weapons  compounds  at  the  plant. 

Salah  Idris,  the  owner  of  Al-Shifa,  sued  the  U.S.  government  in 
American  courts  in  1999.  He  demanded  an  apology  for  the  attack, 
release  of  US$24  million  of  his  assets  frozen  in  U.S.  banks,  and  US$30 
million  in  compensation  for  his  destroyed  factory.  Idris  also  hired  Kroll 
Associates,  an  international  security  company,  to  investigate  U.S.  alle¬ 
gations  that  the  plant  produced  chemical  weapons  and  had  links  to  Iraq. 
The  company  was  unable  to  substantiate  either  accusation.  In  May  the 
United  States  unfroze  his  assets  but  refused  to  admit  it  had  made  a  mis¬ 
take  in  bombing  his  plant.  By  late  1 999,  the  terrorism  issue  and  the  war 
in  Southern  Sudan,  ensured  that  relations  between  Khartoum  and 
Washington  remained  cool. 

The  Peace  Process  in  Southern  Sudan 

Al-Bashir  had  promised,  when  he  seized  power,  to  initiate  peace 
talks  to  end  the  civil  war  in  the  South  because  many  senior  SAF  officers 
had  come  to  believe  that  a  decisive  military  victory  over  the  SPLA  was 
impossible.  Within  days,  Khartoum  announced  a  one-month  cease-fire, 
offered  amnesty  to  all  rebels,  and  invited  SPLA  commander  John 
Garang  to  join  the  peace  process.  Al-Bashir  also  said  he  had  no  objec¬ 
tion  to  the  separation  of  the  South  provided  it  would  accept  a  federal 
system  of  government,  although  Khartoum  later  denied  that  he  had 
made  this  statement.  In  August  1989,  Garang  unveiled  a  peace  initiative 
that  called  for  the  formation  of  a  broad-based  government  of  national 
unity  and  an  army  composed  of  SPLA  and  SAF  personnel.  He  also 
wanted  to  convene  a  national  constitutional  conference  to  resolve  the 
country’s  “fundamental  problems”  and  to  draft  a  new  constitution  in 
preparation  for  “free  general  elections.” 

Al-Bashir  failed  to  respond  to  Garang’s  statement  but  instead 
announced  that  there  would  be  a  national  peace  conference  in  Khartoum. 
However,  the  SPLA  refused  to  attend  because  al-Bashir  advocated  a  fed¬ 
eral  solution  to  the  North-South  problem.  Despite  these  setbacks,  there 
were  two  peace  initiatives  by  early  1990.  Former  U.S.  president  Jimmy 
Carter  sponsored  discussions  in  Nairobi,  while  Egypt  promised  that  it 
would  help  Sudan  achieve  peace.  Both  plans  failed  because,  in  Carter’s 
view,  “neither  side  [was]  prepared  to  take  the  difficult  steps  necessary  for 
peace.”

Historical  Setting 


Nigeria  sponsored  the  next  major  peace  initiative  in  Abuja.  During 
the  first  round  of  talks  (May  26— June  4,  1 992),  the  two  sides  recognized 
that  Sudan  was  a  multiethnic,  multilingual,  multireligious,  and  multicul¬ 
tural  country.  Apart  from  this  acknowledgment,  nothing  else  was 
accomplished.  In  the  second  round  of  negotiations  (April  26-May  1 7, 
1993),  the  attendees  discussed  several  constitutional,  political,  security, 
and  social  issues.  Specific  topics  included  power-sharing  between  Khar¬ 
toum  and  the  federated  states,  the  powers  of  the  central  government,  the 
use  of  a  referendum  to  determine  whether  Southerners  wanted  to  remain 
part  of  Sudan  or  become  independent,  and  the  resettlement  and  rehabili¬ 
tation  of  Southerners  affected  by  the  war. 

In  September  1993,  the  Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Drought 
and  Development  (IGADD),  which  became  in  1996  the  Intergovern¬ 
mental  Authority  on  Development  (IGAD — see  Glossary),  under  the 
chairmanship  of  Kenya’s  president,  Daniel  arap  Moi,  launched  an  ini¬ 
tiative  to  end  the  civil  war.  In  May  1994,  IGADD  adopted  a  declaration 
of  principles  that  acknowledged  the  diversity  of  Sudan’s  various  ethnic 
groups  and  suggested  several  prerequisites  to  enhance  the  country’s 
unity.  The  latter  included  a  secular  constitution,  administrative  decen¬ 
tralization,  respect  for  human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law,  and  equitable 
distribution  of  Sudan’s  wealth  and  resources.  Should  these  principles 
be  ignored,  South  Sudan  could  exercise  the  right  of  self-determination 
or  declare  its  independence. 

Over  the  next  few  years,  there  were  several  IGADD-sponsored  meet¬ 
ings,  but  the  warring  parties  failed  to  reach  a  compromise  on  these 
issues.  In  mid- 1995  the  international  community  sought  to  invigorate 
the  peace  process  by  establishing  the  Friends  of  IGADD  (Britain,  Can¬ 
ada,  Italy,  Netherlands,  Norway,  and  the  United  States).This  informal 
grouping  persuaded  both  sides  to  declare  a  cease-fire.  In  1996  IGAD 
expanded  its  mandate  to  include  regional  economic  cooperation  and  the 
coordination  of  social  and  economic  policies.  The  following  year,  Khar¬ 
toum  accepted  the  1994  declaration  of  principles  as  a  basis  for  future 
negotiations;  however,  subsequent  IGAD-sponsored  talks  (in  October 
1997,  May  1998,  and  August  1998)  failed  to  make  any  significant  prog¬ 
ress.  The  al-Bashir  government  and  the  SPLA  agreed  to  meet  on  April 
20,  1999,  but  Khartoum  refused  to  attend  and  suspended  all  contacts 
with  the  rebels  through  IGAD  because  three  government  officials  and  a 
Sudanese  aid  worker  had  died  while  supposedly  in  SPLA  custody.  By 
late  1999,  the  IGAD  peace  process  remained  moribund  and,  as  a  result, 
Sudan  began  looking  for  an  alternative  mediator.

W.  Daly’s  Empire  on  the  Nile:  The  Anglo-Egyptian  Sudan,  1898-1934 
and  Imperial  Sudan:  The  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium,  1934-56.  The 
postindependence  period  is  discussed  in  Mansour  Khalid’s  The  Gov¬ 
ernment  They  Deserve:  The  Role  of  the  Elite  in  Sudan  s  Political  Evo¬ 
lution ;  his  War  and  Peace  in  Sudan:  A  Tale  of  Two  Countries  is  a 
useful  survey  of  the  country’s  history  after  1898.  Gabriel  Warburg’s 
Islam,  Nationalism,  and  Communism  in  a  Traditional  Society  is  a  stan¬ 
dard  source.  Apart  from  these  books,  the  journal  Sudan  Notes  and 
Records  is  essential  for  studying  Sudan’s  historical  development. 

The  past  few  years  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  literature  about  South¬ 
ern  Sudan.  Many  of  Robert  O.  Collins’s  studies  are  particularly  useful, 
including  Land  Beyond  the  Rivers:  The  Southern  Sudan,  1898-1918 ;

J.  Millard  Burr  and  Robert  O.  Collins  also  have  produced  many  essential 
volumes,  the  most  important  of  which  are  Requiem  for  the  Sudan:  War, 
Drought,  and  Disaster  Relief  on  the  Nile  and  Revolutionary  Sudan: 
Hasan  al-Turabi  and  the  Islamist  State,  1989-2000.  Two  sympathetic 
assessments  of  Southern  Sudan’s  relationship  to  Khartoum  are  Dunstan 
M.  Wai’s,  The  African-Arab  Conflict  in  the  Sudan  and  Abel  Alier’s, 
Southern  Sudan:  Too  Many  Agreements  Dishonoured.  For  an  Arab  view¬ 
point,  Mohamed  Omer  Beshir’s  The  Southern  Sudan:  Background  to

TO  UNDERSTAND  SUDAN — either  the  country  in  general  or  any 
specific  issue,  such  as  the  turmoil  in  Darfur,  endemic  economic  prob¬ 
lems,  political  instability  since  independence  in  1956,  and  many  oth¬ 
ers — requires  first  of  all  an  appreciation  of  Sudan’s  physical  vastness 
and  its  ethnic  and  demographic  diversity,  which  exceed  those  of  all  but  a 
very  small  number  of  nations  on  earth.  The  country  encompasses  virtu¬ 
ally  every  geographical  feature,  from  the  vast  harsh  deserts  of  the  North 
to  the  substantial  rain  forests  rising  on  its  southern  borders. 

Like  most  African  countries,  Sudan  is  defined  by  boundaries  that 
European  powers  determined  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century.  The 
Anglo-Egyptian  colonial  administration  in  Sudan,  established  in  1899, 
emphasized  indirect  rule  by  tribal  sheikhs  and  chiefs,  although  tribalism 
had  been  considerably  weakened  as  an  administrative  institution  during 
the  Mahdist  period  (1885-98).  This  loosening  of  loyalties  exacerbated 
problems  in  governmental  structure  and  administration  and  in  the  peo¬ 
ple’s  identification  as  Sudanese.  To  this  day,  loyalty  remains  divided 
among  family,  clan,  ethnic  group,  and  religion,  and  it  is  difficult  to  forge 
national  unity  because  the  immensity  of  the  land  permits  many  of 
Sudan’s  ethnic  and  tribal  groups  to  live  in  relative  isolation  from  each 
other  and  beyond  the  reach  of  the  central  government. 

The  Nile  is  the  link  that  runs  through  Sudan  and  influences  the  lives 
of  Sudan’s  people,  even  though  many  of  them  farm  and  herd  far  from 
the  Nile  or  its  three  main  tributaries,  the  Blue  Nile,  the  White  Nile,  and 
the  Bahr  al-Ghazal.  Not  only  do  nomads  come  to  the  river  to  water  their 
herds  and  cultivators  to  drain  off  its  waters  for  their  fields,  but  the  Nile 
facilitates  some  trade,  administration,  and  urbanization.  Consequently, 
the  confluence  of  the  Blue  Nile  and  White  Nile  became  the  administra¬ 
tive  center  of  a  vast  hinterland  because  the  area  commanded  the  river,  its 
commerce,  and  its  urban  society.  This  location  enabled  the  urban  elites 
to  exercise  a  limited  degree  of  control  of  the  scattered  and  often  isolated 
population  of  the  interior  while  enjoying  limited  access  to  the  peoples  of 
the  outside  world. 

Although  linked  by  at  least  some  dependence  on  the  Nile,  Sudan’s 
population  is  divided  by  ethnic,  linguistic,  and  religious  differences. 
Many  Sudanese  in  the  North  claim  Arab  descent  and  speak  versions  of 
Arabic,  but  Sudanese  “Arabs”  are  highly  differentiated.  Over  many  gen¬ 
erations,  they  have  intermingled  in  varying  degrees  with  the  indigenous 
peoples  and  are  more  accurately  described  as  “Afro-Arab  ”  By  now, 
Arabic  is  Sudan’s  official  language  (with  Arabic  and  English  the  pre¬ 
dominant  languages  in  the  South),  but  beyond  Khartoum  and  its  two 


61 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


neighboring  cities  of  Omdurman  and  Khartoum  North,  a  variety  of  lan¬ 
guages  are  spoken. 

A  more  unifying  factor  has  been  Islam,  which  has  spread  widely 
among  the  peoples  of  northern  Sudan.  Because  Muslims  are  required  to 
use  Quranic  Arabic  for  ritual  prayer,  knowledge  of  some  Arabic  has 
tended  to  follow  the  spread  of  Islam  as  it  did  in  the  rest  of  North  Africa. 
Only  in  the  middle  of  the  twentieth  century  did  the  Arabic  language 
become  a  defining  factor  for  Arab  identity  and  Arab  nationalism  across 
the  region.  This  development  almost  coincided  in  Sudan  with  the  post- 
World  War  II  struggle  for  independence. 

Whereas  all  Muslims  of  Northern  Sudan  are  Sunni  (see  Glossary), 
they  form  no  monolithic  bloc.  Some,  especially  in  the  urban  centers, 
are  strictly  orthodox  Muslims,  whereas  others,  mostly  in  the  rural  areas 
but  also  on  the  periphery  of  the  capital  region,  are  more  attracted  to 
Sufism  (see  Glossary)  or  other  forms  of  mystical  worship.  Within  this 
branch  and  tendency  of  Islam  are  a  host  of  religious  sects  with  their 
own  Islamic  rituals  and  syncretistic  adaptations. 

The  Sudanese  of  the  South  are  of  purely  African  origin.  Islam  has 
made  only  modest  inroads  among  these  followers  of  traditional  reli¬ 
gions,  as  has  Christianity,  which  spread  in  the  twentieth  century  mostly 
through  the  activities  of  European  missionaries.  Arabic  has  not  replaced 
the  diverse  languages  of  the  South,  but  a  pidgin  form  has  become  more 
widely  spoken  than  English  used  to  be,  especially  in  the  far  South. 

The  differences  between  North  and  South  have  often  engendered 
hostility,  a  clash  of  cultures  that  in  the  last  150  years  has  led  to  frequent 
violence.  The  strong  regional  and  cultural  differences  have  inhibited 
nation  building  and  contributed  to  the  civil  war  in  the  South  that  has 
raged  almost  continuously  since  independence,  except  for  a  period  of 
peace  between  1972  and  1983  and  in  the  early  2000s.  The  distrust 
between  Sudanese  of  the  North  and  those  of  the  South — whether  elite  or 
peasants — has  been  a  constant  during  the  long  years  of  hostilities.  And 
the  cost  of  war  has  drained  valuable  national  resources  at  the  expense  of 
health,  education,  and  welfare  in  both  regions. 

Physical  Setting 

Unitary  Sudan  is  Africa’s  largest  country,  embracing  2,505,813 
square  kilometers  of  northeast  and  central  Africa.  It  consists  of  a  huge 
plain  bordered  on  three  sides  by  mountains:  to  the  east  the  Red  Sea 
Hills,  to  the  west  Jabal  Marrah,  and  on  the  southern  frontier  the  Didinga 
Hills  and  the  Dongotona  and  Imatong  Mountains.  Jutting  up  abruptly  in 
the  south-central  region  of  this  vast  plain  are  the  isolated  Nuba  Moun¬ 
tains  and,  to  their  east,  the  Ingessana  Hills;  far  to  the  southeast  is  the 
lone  Boma  Plateau  near  the  Ethiopian  border.  Spanning  1 8  degrees  of 


62 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


latitude,  the  plain  of  Sudan  includes  from  north  to  south  significant 
regions  with  distinctive  characteristics:  northern  Sudan,  western  Sudan, 
the  central  clay  plains,  the  Jabal  Hadid,  or  Ironstone  Plateau,  and  the 
southern  hill  masses  (see  fig.  8). 

Geographic  Regions 

Northern  Sudan,  lying  between  the  Egyptian  border  and  Khartoum, 
has  two  distinct  parts,  the  desert  and  the  Nile  valley.  To  the  east  of  the 
Nile  lies  the  Nubian  Desert  and  to  the  west  is  the  Libyan  Desert.  They 
are  similar:  stony,  with  sandy  dunes  drifting  over  the  landscape.  There 
is  virtually  no  rainfall  in  these  deserts,  and  in  the  Nubian  Desert  there 
are  no  oases.  In  the  west,  there  are  a  few  small  watering  holes,  such  as 
Bir  en  Natrun.  Here  the  water  table  reaches  the  surface  to  form  wells 
that  provide  water  for  nomads,  caravans,  and  administrative  patrols, 
although  insufficient  to  support  an  oasis  and  inadequate  to  provide  for 
a  settled  population.  Running  through  the  desert  is  the  Nile  valley,  with 
its  alluvial  strip  of  habitable  land  no  more  than  two  kilometers  wide 
and  productivity  dependent  on  the  annual  flood. 

Western  Sudan  is  a  generic  term  describing  the  regions  known  as 
Darfur  and  Kordofan  (also  seen  as  Kurdufan),  which  together  comprise 
850,000  square  kilometers.  From  Khartoum’s  perspective,  this  area  has 
been  traditionally  regarded  as  a  single  regional  unit  despite  the  physical 
differences.  The  dominant  feature  throughout  this  immense  area  is  the 
absence  of  perennial  streams;  thus,  people  and  animals  must  remain 
within  reach  of  permanent  wells.  Consequently,  the  population  is 
sparse  and  unevenly  distributed.  Western  Darfur  is  an  undulating  plain 
dominated  by  the  volcanic  massif  of  Jabal  Marrah  towering  900  meters 
above  the  Sudanic  plain;  the  drainage  from  Jabal  Marrah  onto  the  plain 
can  support  a  settled  population.  Western  Darfur  stands  in  stark  con¬ 
trast  to  northern  and  eastern  Darfur,  which  are  semidesert  with  little 
water  either  from  the  intermittent  streams  known  as  wadis  or  from 
wells  that  normally  go  dry  during  the  winter  months.  Northwest  of  Dar¬ 
fur  and  continuing  into  Chad  lies  the  unusual  region  called  the  jizzu, 
where  sporadic  winter  rains  generated  from  the  Mediterranean  fre¬ 
quently  provide  excellent  grazing  into  January  or  even  February. 

The  southern  region  of  western  Sudan  (including  South  Darfur  and 
South  Kordofan  States)  is  known  as  the  qoz ,  a  land  of  sand  dunes  that 
in  the  rainy  season  is  characterized  by  a  rolling  mantle  of  grass  and 
that  has  more  reliable  sources  of  water  with  its  boreholes  and  man¬ 
made  reservoirs  than  does  the  northern  region.  A  unique  feature  of 
central  Sudan  is  the  Nuba  Mountain  range  of  South  Kordofan,  a  con¬ 
glomerate  of  isolated  dome-shaped,  sugarloaf  hills  that  ascend  steeply 
and  abruptly  from  the  great  Sudanic  plain.  Many  hills  are  isolated  and

extend  only  a  few  square  kilometers,  but  several  large  hill  masses 
with  internal  valleys  cut  through  the  mountains  high  above  the  plain. 

Sudan’s  third  distinct  region  is  the  central  clay  plains  that  stretch 
eastward  from  the  Nuba  Mountains  to  the  Ethiopian  frontier,  broken 
only  by  the  Ingessana  Hills,  and  from  Khartoum  in  the  north  to  the  far 
reaches  of  southern  Sudan.  Between  the  Dindar  and  Rahad  Rivers,  a 
low  ridge  slopes  down  from  the  Ethiopian  highlands  to  break  the  end- 


64 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


less  skyline  of  the  plains,  and  the  occasional  hill  stands  out  in  stark 
relief.  The  central  clay  plains  provide  the  backbone  of  Sudan’s  econ¬ 
omy  because  they  are  a  productive  region  in  which  settlements  cluster 
around  available  water.  Furthermore,  in  the  heartland  of  the  central 
clay  plains  lies  Al-Gezira  (also  seen  as  Al-Jazirah,  literally,  “penin¬ 
sula”  in  Arabic),  the  land  between  the  Blue  Nile  and  the  White  Nile 
north  of  an  imaginary  line  linking  Kosti  and  Sinnar  (also  seen  as  Sen- 
nar  and  Sannar)  where  the  great  Gezira  Scheme  was  developed  (see 
Agriculture,  eh.  3).  The  project  grows  cotton  for  export  and  tradition¬ 
ally  produced  more  than  half  of  Sudan’s  revenue  and  export  earnings. 

Northeast  of  the  central  clay  plains  lies  eastern  Sudan,  which  is 
divided  between  desert  and  semidesert  and  includes  Al-Butanah,  the 
Qash  Delta,  the  Red  Sea  Hills,  and  the  coastal  plain.  Al-Butanah  is  an 
undulating  land  between  Khartoum  and  Kassala  that  provides  adequate 
grazing  for  cattle,  sheep,  and  goats.  East  of  Al-Butanah  is  a  peculiar 
geological  formation  known  as  the  Qash  Delta.  Originally  a  depression, 
it  has  been  filled  with  sand  and  silt  brought  down  by  the  flash  floods  of 
the  Qash  River,  creating  a  delta  above  the  surrounding  plain.  Extending 
100  kilometers  north  of  Kassala,  the  whole  area  watered  by  the  Qash  is 
a  rich  grassland  with  bountiful  cultivation  long  after  the  river  has  spent 
its  waters  on  the  surface  of  its  delta.  Trees  and  bushes  provide  grazing 
for  the  camels  from  the  north,  and  the  rich,  moist  soil  provides  an  abun¬ 
dance  of  food  crops  and  cotton. 

North  of  the  Qash  lie  the  more  formidable  Red  Sea  Hills.  Dry, 
bleak,  and  cooler  than  the  surrounding  land,  particularly  in  the  heat  of 
the  Sudan  summer,  they  stretch  northward  into  Egypt,  a  jumbled  mass 
of  hills  where  life  is  hard  and  unpredictable  for  the  hardy  Beja  inhabit¬ 
ants.  Below  the  hills  sprawls  the  coastal  plain  of  the  Red  Sea,  varying 
in  width  from  about  56  kilometers  in  the  south  near  Tawkar  to  about 
24  kilometers  near  the  Egyptian  border.  The  coastal  plain  is  dry  and 
barren.  It  consists  of  rocks,  and  the  seaward  side  is  thick  with  coral 
reefs. 

The  southern  clay  plains,  which  can  be  regarded  as  an  extension  of 
the  northern  clay  plains,  extend  all  the  way  from  northern  Sudan  to  the 
mountains  of  the  Sudan-Uganda  border,  and  in  the  west  from  the  bor¬ 
ders  of  the  Central  African  Republic  eastward  to  the  Ethiopian  high¬ 
lands.  This  great  Nilotic  plain  is  broken  by  several  distinctive  features. 
First,  the  White  Nile  bisects  the  plain  and  provides  large  permanent 
expanses  of  water  such  as  lakes  Fajarial,  No,  and  Shambe.  Second,  Al- 
Sudd,  the  world’s  largest  swamp,  provides  a  formidable  expanse  of 
lakes,  lagoons,  and  aquatic  plants,  an  area  that  in  high  floodwaters 
exceeds  30,000  square  kilometers,  approximately  the  area  of  Belgium. 
So  intractable  was  this  sudd  (see  Glossary),  or  barrier,  as  an  obstacle  to 


65 


Sudan:  A  Countiy  Study 


navigation  that  a  passage  was  not  discovered  until  the  mid-nineteenth 
century.  Then  as  now,  Al-Sudd,  with  its  extreme  rate  of  evaporation, 
absorbs  on  average  more  than  half  the  waters  that  flow  down  the  White 
Nile  from  the  equatorial  lakes  of  Central  Africa.  These  waters  also  cre¬ 
ate  an  annual  flood  plain  known  as  the  toich ,  which  provides  grazing 
when  the  floodwaters  retreat  to  the  permanent  swamp  and  sluggish 
river,  the  Bahr  al-Jabal,  as  the  White  Nile  is  called  here. 

The  land  rising  to  the  south  and  west  of  the  southern  clay  plains  is 
referred  to  as  the  Ironstone  Plateau  (Jabal  Hadid),  a  name  derived  from 
its  laterite  soil  and  increasing  elevation.  The  plateau  rises  from  the  west 
bank  of  the  Nile,  sloping  gradually  upward  to  the  Congo-Nile  water¬ 
shed.  The  land  is  well  watered,  providing  rich  cultivation,  but  the 
streams  and  rivers  that  come  down  from  the  watershed  divide  and  erode 
the  land  before  they  flow  onto  the  Nilotic  plain  and  into  Al-Sudd. 
Along  the  streams  of  the  watershed  are  the  gallery  forests,  the  begin¬ 
nings  of  the  tropical  rain  forests  that  extend  far  into  the  Democratic 
Republic  of  the  Congo.  To  the  east  of  the  Jabal  Hadid  and  the  Bahr  al- 
Jabal  rise  the  foothills  of  the  mountain  ranges  along  the  Sudan-Uganda 
border — the  Imatong,  Dongotona,  and  Didinga — which  rise  to  more 
than  3,000  meters.  These  mountains  form  a  stark  contrast  to  the  great 
plains  to  the  north  that  dominate  Sudan’s  geography. 

Soils 

The  country’s  soils  can  be  divided  geographically  into  three  catego¬ 
ries:  the  sandy  soils  of  the  northern  and  west-central  areas,  the  clay 
soils  of  the  central  region,  and  the  laterite  soils  of  the  south.  Less 
extensive  and  widely  separated,  but  of  major  economic  importance,  is 
a  fourth  group  consisting  of  alluvial  soils  found  along  the  lower 
reaches  of  the  White  Nile  and  Blue  Nile  Rivers,  along  the  main  Nile  to 
Lake  Nubia,  in  the  delta  of  the  Qash  River  in  the  Kassala  area,  and  in 
the  Barakah  Delta  in  the  area  of  Tawkar  near  the  Red  Sea. 

Agriculturally,  the  most  important  soils  are  the  clays  in  central 
Sudan  that  extend  from  west  of  Kassala  into  southern  Kordofan. 
Known  as  cracking  soils  because  of  the  practice  of  allowing  them  to 
dry  out  and  crack  during  the  dry  months  to  restore  their  permeability, 
they  are  the  basis  in  parts  of  Al-Gezira  and  Khashm  al-Qirbah  for  irri¬ 
gated  cultivation.  East  of  the  Blue  Nile,  large  areas  are  used  to  grow 
rainfed  crops  by  farmers  who  have  mechanized  equipment.  West  of  the 
White  Nile,  these  soils  allow  traditional  cultivators  to  grow  sorghum, 
sesame,  peanuts,  and  (in  the  area  around  the  Nuba  Mountains)  cotton. 
The  southern  part  of  the  clay-soil  zone  lies  in  the  broad  floodplain  of 
the  upper  reaches  of  the  White  Nile  and  its  tributaries,  covering  most 
of  Upper  Nile,  Jonglei,  North  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  and  Warab  States.  Sub- 


66 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


ject  to  heavy  rainfall  during  the  rainy  season,  the  floodplain  proper  is 
inundated  for  four  to  six  months  each  year.  The  large  swampy  area,  Al- 
Sudd,  is  permanently  flooded,  and  adjacent  areas  are  flooded  for  one  or 
two  months.  In  general,  this  area  is  poorly  suited  to  crop  production, 
but  the  grasses  it  supports  during  dry  periods  are  used  for  grazing. 

The  sandy  soils  in  the  semiarid  areas  south  of  the  desert  in  North 
Kordofan  and  North  Darfur  States  support  vegetation  used  for  grazing. 
In  the  southern  part  of  these  states  and  the  western  part  of  southern  Dar¬ 
fur  are  the  so-called  qoz  sands.  Livestock  raising  is  this  area’s  major 
activity,  but  a  significant  amount  of  crop  cultivation,  mainly  of  millet, 
also  occurs.  Peanuts  and  sesame  are  grown  as  cash  crops.  The  qoz 
sands  are  the  principal  area  from  which  gum  arabic  is  obtained  through 
tapping  of  Acacia  Senegal  (known  locally  as  hashab).  This  tree  grows 
readily  in  the  region,  and  cultivators  occasionally  plant  hashab  when 
land  is  returned  to  fallow.  Sudan  produces  about  60  percent  of  the 
world’s  gum  arabic. 

The  laterite  soils  of  the  south  cover  most  of  West  Equatoria  and 
West  Bahr  al-Ghazal  States.  They  underlie  the  extensive  moist  wood¬ 
lands  found  in  these  provinces.  Crop  production  is  scattered,  and  the 
soils,  where  cultivated,  lose  fertility  relatively  quickly;  even  the  richer 
soils  are  usually  returned  to  bush  fallow  within  five  years. 

Hydrology 

Except  for  a  small  area  in  northeastern  Sudan,  where  wadis  dis¬ 
charge  the  sporadic  runoff  into  the  Red  Sea  or  rivers  from  Eritrea  flow 
into  shallow  evaporating  ponds  west  of  the  Red  Sea  Hills,  the  entire 
country  is  drained  by  the  Nile  and  its  two  main  tributaries,  the  Blue 
Nile  and  the  White  Nile.  The  longest  river  in  the  world,  the  Nile  flows 
for  6,737  kilometers  from  its  farthest  headwaters  in  central  Africa  to 
the  Mediterranean.  The  importance  of  the  Nile  has  been  recognized 
since  biblical  times;  for  centuries  the  river  has  been  a  lifeline  for 
Sudan. 

The  Blue  Nile  flows  out  of  the  Ethiopian  highlands  to  meet  the 
White  Nile  at  Khartoum.  The  Blue  Nile  is  the  smaller  of  the  two  riv¬ 
ers;  its  flow  usually  accounts  for  only  one-sixth  of  the  total.  In  August, 
however,  the  rains  in  the  Ethiopian  highlands  swell  the  Blue  Nile  until 
it  accounts  for  90  percent  of  the  Nile’s  total  flow.  Sudan  has  con¬ 
structed  several  dams  to  regulate  the  river’s  flow:  the  Roseires  Dam, 
about  100  kilometers  from  the  Ethiopian  border;  the  Meina  al-Mak 
Dam  at  Sinjah;  and  the  largest,  the  40-meter-high  Sinnar  Dam  con¬ 
structed  in  1925  at  Sinnar.  The  Blue  Nile’s  two  main  tributaries,  the 
Dindar  and  the  Rahad,  have  headwaters  in  the  Ethiopian  highlands  and 
discharge  water  into  the  Blue  Nile  only  during  the  summer  high-water 


67 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


season.  For  the  remainder  of  the  year,  their  flow  is  reduced  to  pools  in 
sandy  riverbeds. 

The  White  Nile  flows  north  from  central  Africa,  draining  Lake  Victo¬ 
ria  and  highland  regions  of  Uganda,  Rwanda,  and  Burundi.  North  of 
Uganda,  the  Nile  is  known  as  Bahr  al-Jabal  until  the  point  at  Lake  No, 
where  the  Bahr  al-Ghazal  flows  into  it.  At  Bor,  the  southern  edge  of  the 
great  swamp  of  the  Nile,  Al-Sudd,  begins.  The  river  has  no  well-defined 
channel  here;  the  water  flows  slowly  through  a  labyrinth  of  small  spill¬ 
ways  and  lakes  choked  with  papyrus  and  reeds.  Much  water  is  lost  to 
evaporation.  To  provide  for  water  transportation  through  this  region  and 
to  speed  the  river’s  flow  so  that  less  water  evaporates,  Sudan,  with 
French  help,  began  building  the  Jonglei  Canal  (see  Glossary;  also  seen 
as  Junqali  Canal)  from  Bor  to  a  point  just  upstream  from  Malakal.  How¬ 
ever,  construction  was  suspended  in  1984  because  of  security  problems 
caused  by  the  civil  war  in  the  region. 

South  of  Khartoum,  the  British  built  the  Jabal  al-Awliya  Dam  in 
1937  to  store  the  water  of  the  White  Nile  and  then  release  it  in  the  fall 
when  the  flow  from  the  Blue  Nile  slackens.  Much  water  from  the  res¬ 
ervoir  has  been  diverted  for  irrigation  projects  in  central  Sudan,  how¬ 
ever,  and  much  of  the  remainder  evaporates.  By  now,  silt  deposits 
have  curtailed  the  overall  flow. 

The  White  Nile  has  several  substantial  tributaries  that  drain  south¬ 
ern  Sudan.  In  the  southwest,  the  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  its  major  tribu¬ 
tary,  the  Bahr  al-Arab,  which  meet  at  Al-Sudd,  drain  a  basin  larger  in 
area  than  France.  Although  the  drainage  area  is  extensive,  evaporation 
takes  most  of  the  water  from  the  slow-moving  streams  in  this  region, 
and  the  discharge  of  the  Bahr  al-Ghazal  into  the  White  Nile  is  mini¬ 
mal.  In  southeast  Sudan,  the  Sobat  River  drains  an  area  of  western 
Ethiopia  and  the  hills  north  of  the  Sudan-Uganda  border.  The  Sobat’ s 
discharge  is  considerable;  at  its  confluence  with  the  White  Nile  just 
south  of  Malakal,  the  Sobat  accounts  for  half  the  White  Nile’s  water. 

North  of  Khartoum,  the  Nile  flows  through  the  desert  in  a  large  S- 
shaped  pattern  to  empty  into  Lake  Nasser  behind  the  Aswan  High 
Dam  in  Egypt.  The  river  flows  slowly  beyond  Khartoum,  dropping  lit¬ 
tle  in  elevation,  although  five  cataracts  hinder  river  transport  at  times 
of  low  water.  The  Atbarah  River,  flowing  out  of  Ethiopia,  is  the  only 
tributary  north  of  Khartoum,  and  its  waters  reach  the  Nile  for  only  the 
six  months  between  July  and  December.  During  the  rest  of  the  year, 
the  Atbarah ’s  bed  is  dry,  except  for  a  few  pools  and  ponds. 

Sudan  faces  some  severe  environmental  problems,  most  related 
either  to  the  availability  of  water  or  its  disposal.  Among  them  are 
desertification,  land  degradation,  and  deforestation.  Desertification,  the 
southward  shift  of  the  boundary  between  desert  and  semidesert,  has 


68

occurred  at  an  estimated  rate  of  50  to  200  kilometers  since  records  of 
rainfall  and  vegetation  began  in  the  1930s.  Its  impact  has  been  most 
notable  in  North  Darfur  and  North  Kordofan.  Desertification  is  likely 
to  continue  its  southward  progression  because  of  declining  precipita¬ 
tion  and  will  lead  to  continued  loss  of  productive  land.  Agriculture, 
particularly  poorly  planned  and  managed  mechanized  agriculture,  has 
led  to  land  degradation,  water  pollution,  and  related  problems.  Land 
degradation  has  also  resulted  from  an  explosive  growth  in  the  size  of 
livestock  herds  since  the  1 960s  that  has  overtaxed  grazing  areas.  Defor¬ 
estation  has  occurred  at  an  alarming  rate.  Sudan  as  a  whole  might  have 
lost  nearly  12  percent  of  its  forest  cover  between  1990  and  2005,  or 
about  8.8  million  hectares  (see  Glossary),  a  loss  driven  primarily  by 
land  clearance  and  energy  needs.  Northern,  eastern,  and  central  Sudan 
have  been  gravely  affected;  southern  Sudan  is  estimated  to  have  lost 
some  40  percent  of  its  forest  cover  since  independence. 

Compounding  Sudan’s  environmental  problems  are  long  years  of 
warfare  and  the  resultant  camps  for  large  numbers  of  internally  dis¬ 
placed  people,  who  scour  the  surrounding  land  for  water,  fuel,  and  food. 
United  Nations  (UN)  experts  predict  that  riverbank  erosion  and  loss  of 
fertilizing  silt  will  occur  from  Sudan’s  current  ambitious  program  of 
dam  construction  on  the  Nile  and  its  tributaries.  In  urban  areas,  rapid  and 
uncontrolled  population  influx  into  Khartoum  and  other  cities  and  towns 


69

and  the  general  lack  of  facilities  to  manage  solid  waste  and  sewage  are 
among  major  environmental  concerns. 

Climate 

Although  Sudan  lies  within  the  tropics,  the  climate  ranges  from  arid 
in  the  north  to  tropical  wet-and-dry  in  the  far  southwest.  Temperatures 
do  not  vary  greatly  with  the  season  at  any  location;  the  most  signifi¬ 
cant  climatic  variables  are  rainfall  and  the  length  of  the  dry  season. 
Variations  in  the  length  of  the  dry  season  depend  on  which  of  two  air 
flows  predominates:  dry  northern  winds  from  the  Sahara  and  the  Ara¬ 
bian  Peninsula  or  moist  southwesterly  winds  from  the  Congo  River 
basin  and  southeasterly  winds  from  the  Indian  Ocean. 

From  January  to  March,  the  country  is  under  the  influence  of  dry 
northeasterlies.  There  is  minimal  rainfall  countrywide,  except  for  a 
small  area  in  northwestern  Sudan  where  the  winds  have  passed  over  the 
Mediterranean  and  bring  occasional  light  rains.  By  early  April,  the  moist 
south  westerlies  have  reached  southern  Sudan,  bringing  heavy  rains  and 
thunderstorms.  By  July  the  moist  air  has  reached  Khartoum,  and  in 
August  it  extends  to  its  usual  northern  limits  around  Abu  Hamad, 
although  in  some  years  the  humid  air  may  even  reach  the  Egyptian  bor¬ 
der.  The  flow  becomes  weaker  as  it  spreads  north.  In  September,  the  dry 
northeasterlies  begin  to  strengthen  and  to  push  south,  and  by  the  end  of 
December  they  cover  the  entire  country.  Yambio,  close  to  the  border 
with  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  has  a  nine-month  rainy  sea¬ 
son  (April-December)  and  receives  an  average  of  1,142  millimeters  of 
rain  each  year;  Khartoum  has  a  three-month  rainy  season  (July-Septem- 
ber)  with  an  annual  average  rainfall  of  161  millimeters;  Atbarah 
receives  showers  in  August  that  produce  an  annual  average  of  only  74 
millimeters. 

In  some  years,  the  arrival  of  the  southwesterlies  and  their  rain  in  cen¬ 
tral  Sudan  can  be  delayed,  or  they  may  not  come  at  all.  If  that  happens, 
drought  and  famine  follow.  The  decades  of  the  1970s,  1980s,  and 
1990s  saw  the  southwesterlies  frequently  fail,  with  disastrous  results 
for  the  Sudanese  people  and  economy. 

Temperatures  are  the  highest  at  the  end  of  the  dry  season,  when  cloud¬ 
less  skies  and  dry  air  allow  them  to  soar.  The  far  south,  however,  with 
only  a  short  dry  season,  has  unifonnly  high  temperatures  throughout  the 
year.  In  Khartoum,  the  hottest  months  are  May  and  June,  when  average 
highs  are  41°  C,  and  temperatures  can  reach  48°  C.  Northern  Sudan,  with 
its  short  rainy  season,  has  hot  daytime  temperatures  year-round,  except 
for  winter  months  in  the  northwest,  where  there  is  some  precipitation  in 
January  and  February.  Conditions  in  highland  areas  are  generally  cooler, 
and  the  hot  daytime  temperatures  during  the  dry  season  throughout  cen-

tral  and  northern  Sudan  fall  rapidly  after  sunset.  Lows  in  Khartoum  aver¬ 
age  1 5°  C  in  January  and  have  dropped  as  low  as  6°  C  after  the  passing  of 
a  cool  front  in  winter. 

The  haboob,  a  violent  dust  storm,  can  occur  in  central  Sudan  when 
the  moist  southwesterly  flow  first  arrives  (May  through  July).  The 
moist,  unstable  air  forms  thunderstorms  in  the  heat  of  the  afternoon. 
The  initial  downflow  of  air  from  an  approaching  storm  produces  a  huge 
yellow/red  wall  of  sand  and  clay  that  can  temporarily  reduce  visibility 
to  zero;  traffic  comes  to  a  standstill,  and  line  sand  particles  penetrate  the 
most  unlikely  places. 

Population 

Sudan’s  vast  territory,  coupled  with  its  history  of  near-constant  civil 
conflict,  has  made  gathering  precise  demographic  data  a  daunting  task. 
The  Sudanese  government  conducted  national  censuses  in  1955-56, 
1973,  1983,  and  1993.  Each  had  serious  flaws.  The  first  census  was 
inadequately  prepared  and  executed.  The  second  was  not  officially  rec¬ 
ognized  by  the  government,  and  its  findings  were  never  released.  The 
third  census  was  of  better  quality,  but  some  of  the  data  have  never  been 
analyzed  because  of  inadequate  resources.  The  1993  census  was  plagued 
by  irregularities  and  data  gaps,  most  notably  data  from  Southern  Sudan. 
The  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  of  January  2005  called  for  a 
countrywide  national  census  as  the  basis  for  an  equitable  allocation  of 
resources,  infrastructure,  and  power  (see  Recent  Constitutional  Develop¬ 
ments,  ch.  4).  This  fifth  national  census  was  mandated  to  occur  not  later 
than  mid-2007,  but  it  was  not  carried  out  until  April  22-30,  2008.  Pre¬ 
liminary  results  were  available  in  late  2010  in  time  for  the  Southern 
Sudan  independence  referendum  in  January  2011. 

The  U.S.  Census  Bureau  estimated  that  Sudan  had  a  population  of  8 
million  in  1950  and  nearly  14  million  in  1970.  Sudan’s  own  census  of 
1983  showed  the  total  population  to  be  21.6  million,  reflecting  an  annual 
growth  rate  between  1956  and  1983  of  2.8  percent.  The  next  official  cen¬ 
sus,  conducted  in  1993,  placed  Sudan’s  population  at  24.9  million,  but  it 
omitted  the  South  because  of  continuing  civil  war.  According  to  the 
2008  census,  Sudan’s  population  totaled  39.2  million,  of  whom  30.9 
million  lived  in  the  North  and  8.3  million  in  the  South.  Of  the  total  popu¬ 
lation,  males  slightly  outnumbered  females  (at  20.1  million  vsersus  19.1 
million);  those  aged  16  years  and  younger  constituted  47.2  percent  of  the 
total,  of  whom  46.7  percent  were  in  the  North  and  49.0  percent  in  the 
South  (see  fig.  9).  The  U.S.  Census  Bureau’s  estimate  of  Sudan’s  mid¬ 
year  2008  population  was  40.2  million,  with  a  birthrate  of  34  births  per 
1,000,  a  death  rate  of  14  per  1,000,  and  a  rate  of  growth  about  2.1  per¬ 
cent.  As  long  as  Sudan  continues  to  grow  at  or  near  its  current  pace,  it

will  rank  among  the  world’s  fastest-growing  countries.  While  popula¬ 
tion  models  vary,  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  projected  a  population  of  49.8 
million  in  2015  and  63.1  million  in  2025. 

Despite  these  projections,  the  country’s  population  growth  rate  has 
been  steadily  declining  and  will  likely  continue  to  do  so.  The  U.S.  Cen¬ 
sus  Bureau  and  the  World  Bank  estimated  that  population  growth 
peaked  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  at  3.2  and  3.3  percent,  respectively,  and 
that  it  has  gradually  fallen  since  that  time.  From  1990  to  2000,  the  popu¬ 
lation  grew  by  2.8  percent;  by  the  early  2000s,  the  rate  had  declined  to 
about  2.6  percent  or  lower.  Sudan’s  estimate  of  its  annual  population 
growth  from  1983  to  2008  was  2.8  percent.  Experts  predict  that  the  pop¬ 
ulation  growth  rate  will  fall  below  2  percent  sometime  around  2020. 

Sudan  had  a  population  density  in  mid-2008  of  only  16  persons  per 
square  kilometer,  but  this  figure  is  misleading  because  much  of  Sudan  is 
uninhabitable,  and  its  people  are  unevenly  distributed  throughout  the 
country.  Roughly  two-thirds  of  Sudan’s  population  resides  within  300- 
500  kilometers  of  Khartoum  and  is  concentrated  around  Khartoum  and 


72

in  Al-Gezira.  Government  estimates  for  2007  showed  that  the  country’s 
most  densely  populated  states  were  Khartoum  (16.7  percent),  Al-Gezira 
(11.1  percent),  and  South  Darfur  (9.4  percent),  a  population  distribution 
seemingly  confirmed  by  the  2008  census.  In  the  South,  the  2008  census 
showed  that  the  most  populous  states  were  Jonglei  (1.4  million),  Central 
Equatoria  (ca.  1 .2  million),  and  Warab  (ca.  1 .0  million).  The  census  also 
showed  that  for  Sudan  as  a  whole,  the  urban-rural  ratio  was  29.5  and 
70.5  (42.0  and  58.1  in  the  North,  and  17.01  and  83.0  in  the  South),  less 
than  average  rates  of  urbanization  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  much  less 
than  in  North  Africa.  The  population  of  the  Three  Towns  (see  Glossary) 
of  the  Khartoum  metropolitan  area  is  uncertain  because  of  fluctuations 
in  the  number  of  refugees,  but  estimates  of  5  million  may  be  realistic.  In 
general,  Sudan  remains  an  overwhelmingly  rural  nation. 

In  2009  the  United  Nations  reported  that  life  expectancy  at  birth  for 
Sudanese  citizens  averaged  58  years,  57  years  for  males  and  59  for 
females,  an  increase  from  46  years  in  1970  and  53  years  in  1990.  This 
average  compares  positively  with  that  of  other  African  nations  (52 
years)  and  is  comparable  to  other  nations  at  a  similar  stage  of  economic 
development  (58  years).  Life  expectancy  is  expected  to  continue  to 
increase  in  coming  decades;  for  example,  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  pre¬ 
dicts  that  average  life  expectancy  in  Sudan  will  reach  66  years  by 
2025.  In  2009  the  annual  number  of  births  totaled  1.3  million.  The  rate 
of  infant  mortality  (under  one  year)  was  69  deaths  per  1 ,000  live  births, 
and  the  total  fertility  rate  (lifetime  births  per  female)  was  4.1.  Both 
rates  showed  substantial  declines  since  the  1980s. 

In  the  South,  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  reported  that  as 
of  the  mid-2000s,  life  expectancy  was  42  years,  significantly  less  than 
for  the  country  in  general.  A  household  health  survey  conducted  by  the 
Southern  government  in  2006  found  that  the  infant  mortality  rate  was 
102  deaths  per  1,000  live  births;  the  under-five  mortality  rate,  135  per 
1,000;  and  the  maternal  mortality  rate,  2,054  deaths  per  100,000  live 
births,  all  among  the  highest  rates  in  the  world.  Average  nationwide 
statistics  for  1993-99  for  these  same  categories — 65  per  1,000,  125  per 
100,000,  and  506  per  100,000,  respectively — were  well  below  those  of 
the  South  as  of  2006  (see  Health,  this  ch.).  Contraceptive  use  remains 
very  low  in  Sudan.  For  the  most  part,  only  urban  elites  have  knowledge 
of  basic  family-planning  practices.  Sudan  does  not  have  a  national 
family-planning  program. 

Migration  and  Refugees 

The  era  since  independence  has  seen  a  notable  increase  in  internal 
migration.  In  the  early  postindependence  years,  most  migrants  left 
their  homes  in  search  of  employment  in  large  agricultural  projects  or 


73 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


in  large  urban  centers,  particularly  the  Three  Towns,  which  attracted 
some  50  percent  of  all  internal  migrants.  Their  numbers  escalated 
greatly  in  the  late  1980s  because  of  drought  and  famine,  the  civil  war 
in  the  South,  and  Chadian  incursions  into  the  West.  As  in  the  past, 
migrants  left  their  homelands  for  economic,  social,  and  psychological 
reasons,  but  now  with  the  added  factor  of  personal  survival. 

Internal  migration  created  problems  of  employment,  housing,  and 
services,  and  it  also  had  an  enormous  impact  on  ethnicity.  Although 
migrants  tended  to  cluster  with  their  kinfolk  in  their  new  environments, 
the  daily  interaction  with  Sudanese  from  many  other  ethnic  groups  rap¬ 
idly  eroded  traditional  values  learned  in  the  villages.  In  the  best  of  cir¬ 
cumstances,  this  erosion  might  lead  to  a  new  sense  of  national  identity 
as  Sudanese,  but  the  new  communities  often  lacked  effective  absorp¬ 
tive  mechanisms  and  were  weak  economically.  Ethnic  divisions  were 
thus  reinforced,  and  at  the  same  time  social  anomie  was  perpetuated. 
Refugees  from  other  countries,  like  internal  migrants,  were  a  factor 
that  further  complicated  ethnic  patterns. 

By  the  early  2000s,  continued  conflict  in  the  South  and  the  outbreak 
of  warfare  in  Darfur  had  led  to  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of 
internally  displaced  people  (IDPs).  In  1991  the  United  Nations  High 
Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR)  reported  that  approximately  1.8 
million  IDPs,  many  of  them  Southerners,  resided  in  the  North,  of  whom 
an  estimated  750,000  were  in  what  was  then  Al-Khartoum  State,  30,000 
each  in  Kordofan  and  Al-Awsat  States,  300,000  each  in  Darfur  and  Ash 
Sharqi  States,  and  150,000  in  Ash  Shamali  State.  In  January  2009,  the 
UNHCR  estimated  that  there  were  more  than  4  million  IDPs  in  Sudan 
excluding  the  South,  including  2.5  million  IDPs  in  the  Darfur  region  and 
1.7  million  in  Khartoum  State,  most  of  them  Southerners.  In  addition, 
some  30,000  refugees  from  neighboring  countries  also  resided  in  Khar¬ 
toum.  As  for  the  South,  international  organizations  estimated  that  4  mil¬ 
lion  people  there  had  been  displaced,  more  than  2  million  deaths  had 
occurred,  and  600,000  were  forced  into  exile  between  the  resumption  of 
the  civil  war  in  1983  and  its  end  in  2005.  Figures  for  total  displaced  pop¬ 
ulations  within  Sudan  varied  according  to  the  source.  For  example,  the 
Norwegian  Internal  Displacement  Monitoring  Centre  reported  that  as  of 
early  2009,  about  4.9  million  remained  internally  displaced,  half  of  them 
in  the  Darfur  region. 

Aside  from  Sudanese  who  have  relocated  within  their  own  country, 
almost  700,000  had  left  Sudan  altogether  as  of  2005,  including  the  esti¬ 
mated  600,000  from  the  South.  Uganda  hosted  more  than  200,000  of 
them;  tens  of  thousands  more  had  fled  to  Kenya.  UN  officials  reported 
in  March  2006  that  an  average  of  100-125  Sudanese  migrants  arrived 
at  one  of  their  12  refugee  camps  in  eastern  Chad  each  day.  By  January 


74 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


2009,  the  number  of  Sudanese  refugees  in  Chad  had  risen  to  almost 
250,000,  whereas  the  numbers  in  Kenya  had  declined  to  about  23,000. 
In  late  2008,  the  UNHCR  estimated  that  nearly  130,000  Sudanese  refu¬ 
gees  still  resided  in  Egypt,  Ethiopia,  Kenya,  and  Uganda.  Aside  from 
Egypt,  a  relatively  small  number  of  Sudanese  have  sought  refuge  in  the 
Arab  world  in  Lebanon  and  Syria. 

Refugees  not  only  have  flowed  out  of  Sudan,  but  they  also  have 
streamed  in.  As  of  late  2008,  the  UNHCR  reported  roughly  230,000 
refugees  from  other  countries  in  Sudan.  Some  147,000  were  housed  in 
camps  along  the  border  with  Eritrea.  Almost  all  were  Eritreans  except 
for  perhaps  10,000  to  15,000  Ethiopians.  Many  of  these  refugees  had 
lived  in  eastern  Sudan  for  more  than  40  years  as  a  result  of  conflict  and 
famine  in  their  homelands.  Since  July  2007,  this  region  had  seen  a  con¬ 
tinuing  influx  of  newcomers  from  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  and  Somalia.  Some 
45,000  Chadians  and  3,000  refugees  from  the  Central  African  Republic 
had  crossed  into  Darfur  as  a  result  of  raiding  and  fighting  along 
Sudan’s  western  border,  some  of  it  dating  to  the  1990s.  An  estimated 
30,000  refugees  and  asylum  seekers  resided  in  Khartoum,  most  of  them 
Eritreans  and  Ethiopians;  a  few  Ethiopian  refugees  were  found  in  the 
South. 

Large  numbers  of  IDPs  and  refugees  abroad  had  begun  to  return  to 
their  homes  as  a  result  of  peace  efforts  between  the  North  and  the 
South.  As  of  early  2009,  more  than  2  million  of  the  estimated  4  million 
from  the  South  who  had  fled  their  homeland  for  the  North  were 
thought  to  have  returned  home.  Many  had  done  so  with  encouragement 
from  the  new  Government  of  South  Sudan,  whose  policy  was  to 
encourage  Southerners  to  return  to  the  South,  apparently  in  view  of  the 
upcoming  national  census.  Nonetheless,  large  numbers  had  chosen  to 
remain  in  their  places  of  refuge,  including  the  estimated  1.7  million  in 
and  around  Khartoum,  because  they  preferred  the  amenities  and  alter¬ 
native  livelihoods  associated  with  urban  life,  because  they  lacked  the 
means  to  move  on  their  own,  or  because  they  were  discouraged  by  the 
lack  of  infrastructure,  services,  and  security  in  their  homelands.  By 
remaining  in  the  North,  however,  the  displaced  faced  generally  squalid 
conditions  in  refugee  camps  and,  in  Khartoum,  forced  relocation  as  the 
government  cleared  land  for  urban  development.  At  the  same  time, 
tensions  associated  with  peace  efforts  were  responsible  for  large  num¬ 
bers  of  IDPs  in  three  regions  along  the  border  between  North  and 
South,  namely,  Abyei,  Blue  Nile  State,  and  South  Kordofan.

Ethnicity  and  Languages 

Ethnicity 

Sudan’s  ethnic  and  linguistic  diversity  is  among  the  most  complex 
in  the  world.  Its  nearly  600  ethnic  groups  speak  more  than  400  lan¬ 
guages  and  dialects,  many  of  them  intelligible  to  only  a  small  number 
of  individuals.  In  recent  decades,  some  of  these  small  groups  have  been 
absorbed  by  larger  groups,  and  migration  often  causes  individuals 
reared  in  one  tongue  to  converse  only  in  the  dominant  language  of  the 
new  area.  Some  linguistic  groups  have  been  absorbed  by  accommoda¬ 
tion,  others  by  conflict.  In  the  case  of  migrants  to  the  Three  Towns, 
Arabic  is  the  lingua  franca  even  for  Southerners,  while  the  use  of  Eng¬ 
lish  continues  to  decline  in  quantity  and  quality. 

The  definition  and  boundaries  of  ethnic  groups  depend  on  how  peo¬ 
ple  perceive  themselves  and  others.  Language,  cultural  characteristics, 
and  common  ancestry  may  be  used  as  markers  of  ethnic  identity  or  dif¬ 
ference,  but  they  do  not  always  define  groups  of  people.  Thus,  the  peo¬ 
ple  called  Atuot  and  the  much  larger  group  called  Nuer  speak 
essentially  the  same  language,  share  many  cultural  characteristics,  and 
acknowledge  a  common  ancestry,  but  each  group  defines  itself  and  the 
other  as  different.  Moreover,  ethnic  group  names  commonly  used  in 
Sudan  and  by  foreign  analysts  are  not  always  used  by  the  people  them¬ 
selves.  This  fact  is  particularly  true  for  non-Arab  groups  known  by 
names  coined  by  Arabs  or  by  the  British,  who  based  the  names  on 
terms  used  by  Arabs  or  others,  not  by  the  group  itself.  Thus,  the  Dinka 
and  the  Nuer,  the  largest  groups  in  the  South,  call  themselves,  respec¬ 
tively,  Jieng  and  Naadh,  and  not  Dinka  or  Nuer. 

The  distinction  between  Sudan’s  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  people 
has  been  of  considerable  importance  in  the  country’s  modem  history 
and  provides  a  preliminary  ordering  of  ethnic  groups.  It  does  not,  how¬ 
ever,  correspond  in  any  simple  way  to  distinctions  based  on  linguistic, 
cultural,  or  racial  criteria,  nor  to  social  or  political  solidarity.  Choice  of 
language  has  played  a  political  role  in  the  ethnic  and  religious  cleavage 
between  the  peoples  of  the  North  and  of  the  South.  English  traditionally 
was  associated  with  being  non-Muslim,  as  Arabic  was  associated  with 
Islam.  Yet,  recent  migration  from  the  South  to  destinations  throughout 
northern  towns  even  as  far  north  as  Dongola  (also  seen  as  Dunqulah), 
plus  aggressive  government  policies  of  Arabization  in  the  school  sys¬ 
tem  during  the  1990s,  make  this  distinction  less  applicable  in  the  early 
2000s.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Languages 

Most  languages  spoken  in  Africa  fall  into  four  language  super¬ 
stocks.  Three  of  them — Afro-Asiatic,  Niger-Kordofanian,  and  Nilo- 
Saharan — are  represented  in  Sudan.  Each  is  divided  into  groups  that 
are  in  turn  subdivided  into  sets  of  closely  related  languages.  Two  or 
more  major  groups  of  each  of  the  three  superstocks  are  present  in 
Sudan,  historically  both  a  north-south  and  an  east-west  migration 
crossroads. 

The  most  widely  spoken  language  in  Sudan  is  Arabic,  a  member  of 
the  Semitic  branch  of  the  Afro-Asiatic  language  family.  Cushitic, 
another  major  branch  of  Afro-Asiatic,  is  represented  by  Bedawiye  (with 
several  dialects),  spoken  by  the  largely  nomadic  Beja.  Chadic,  a  third 
branch,  is  represented  by  its  most  important  single  language,  Hausa,  a 
West  African  tongue  used  in  Nigeria  by  the  Hausa  themselves  and 
employed  by  many  other  West  Africans  in  Sudan  as  a  lingua  franca. 

Niger-Kordofanian  is  first  divided  into  Niger-Congo  and  Kordofa- 
nian.  The  widespread  Niger-Congo  language  group  includes  many  divi¬ 
sions  and  subdivisions  of  languages.  Represented  in  Sudan  are  Azande 
and  several  other  tongues  of  the  Adamawa-Eastem  language  division, 
and  Fulani  of  the  West  Atlantic  division.  The  Kordofanian  stock  com¬ 
prises  only  30  to  40  languages  spoken  in  a  limited  area  of  Sudan — the 
Nuba  Mountains  and  their  environs. 

The  designation  of  a  Nilo-Saharan  superstock  has  not  been  fully 
accepted  by  linguists,  and  its  constituent  groups  and  subgroups  are 
not  firmly  fixed,  in  part  because  many  of  the  languages  have  not  been 
well  studied.  Assuming  the  validity  of  this  language  family  and  its 
internal  divisions,  then  10  of  its  12  major  divisions  and  many  of  their 
subdivisions  are  well  represented  in  Sudan,  where  roughly  75  lan¬ 
guages,  well  over  half  of  those  named  in  the  1955-56  census,  could 
be  identified  as  Nilo-Saharan.  Many  of  these  languages  are  only  used 
by  small  groups  of  people.  Only  six  or  seven  of  them  were  spoken  by 
1  percent  or  more  of  Sudan’s  1956  population.  Perhaps  another  dozen 
were  the  home  languages  of  0.5  to  1  percent.  Included  among  Nilo- 
Saharan  languages  are  Masalit  in  North  Darfur;  various  Nubian  dia¬ 
lects  of  Northern  Sudan;  and  Jieng  (Dinka)  and  Naadh  (Nuer)  in 
Southern  Sudan. 

Many  other  languages  are  spoken  by  a  few  thousand  or  even  a  few 
hundred  people.  Several  lingua  francas  have  emerged,  and  many  peo¬ 
ples  have  become  genuinely  multilingual,  fluent  in  a  native  language 
spoken  at  home,  a  lingua  franca,  and  perhaps  other  languages.  Arabic, 
however,  has  several  different  forms,  and  not  all  who  master  one  are 
able  to  use  another.  Among  the  varieties  noted  by  scholars  are  classical 
Arabic,  the  language  of  the  Quran,  not  a  widespread  spoken  language

and  mostly  used  in  Islamic  rites  and  poetry.  Although  some  Muslims 
might  become  acquainted  with  classical  Arabic  in  the  course  of  rudi¬ 
mentary  religious  schooling,  very  few  except  the  most  educated  know 
it  by  rote.  Modem  Standard  Arabic,  derived  from  classical  Arabic,  is 
used  by  the  educated  in  travel  outside  the  country.  Then  there  are  at 
least  two  kinds  of  colloquial  Arabic  in  Sudan — that  spoken  in  roughly 
the  eastern  half  of  the  country  and  known  as  Sudanese  or  Omdurmani 
colloquial  Arabic,  and  that  spoken  in  western  Sudan,  closely  akin  to 
the  colloquial  Arabic  spoken  in  Chad.  There  are  other  colloquial 
forms.  A  pidgin  called  Juba  Arabic  is  peculiar  to  Southern  Sudan. 

Modem  Standard  Arabic  is  in  principle  the  same  everywhere  in  the 
Arab  world  and  generally  permits  communication  among  educated 
persons  whose  mother  tongue  is  one  or  another  form  of  colloquial  Ara¬ 
bic.  Despite  its  international  character,  however,  Modem  Standard 
Arabic  varies  from  country  to  country.  Nevertheless,  it  has  been  the 
language  used  in  Sudan’s  central  government,  the  press,  Sudan  televi¬ 
sion,  and  Radio  Omdurman.  The  latter  also  broadcast  in  classical  Ara¬ 
bic.  One  observer,  writing  in  the  early  1970s,  noted  that  Arabic 
speakers  (and  others  who  had  acquired  the  language  informally)  in 
western  Sudan  found  it  easier  to  understand  the  Chadian  colloquial 
Arabic  used  by  Chad  Radio  than  the  Modem  Standard  Arabic  used  by 
Radio  Omdurman.  This  may  also  be  the  case  elsewhere  in  rural  Sudan, 
where  villagers  and  nomads  speak  a  local  dialect  of  Arabic. 

Juba  (or  pidgin)  Arabic,  developed  and  learned  informally,  has  been 
used  in  Southern  towns,  particularly  in  the  far  South,  for  some  time 
and  has  spread  slowly  but  steadily  throughout  the  South,  but  not 
always  at  the  expense  of  English.  The  Juba  Arabic  used  in  the  market¬ 
place  and  even  by  political  figures  addressing  ethnically  mixed  urban 
audiences  cannot  be  understood  easily  by  Sudanese  from  the  North. 

Despite  Arabic’s  status  as  the  official  national  language,  English 
was  acknowledged  as  the  principal  language  in  the  South  into  the 
1990s.  It  was  also  the  chief  language  at  the  University  of  Khartoum 
and  was  the  language  of  secondary  schools  even  in  the  North  before 
1969.  In  the  early  1970s  in  the  South,  the  first  two  years  of  primary 
school  were  taught  in  the  local  language.  Thereafter,  through  second¬ 
ary  school,  either  Arabic  or  English  could  be  the  medium  of  instruc¬ 
tion  (English  and  Arabic  were  regarded  as  of  equal  importance);  the 
language  not  used  as  a  medium  was  taught  as  a  subject.  At  the  time 
when  this  option  was  established,  roughly  half  the  general  secondary 
schools  (equivalent  to  grades  seven  through  nine)  were  conducted  in 
Arabic  and  half  in  English  in  what  were  then  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  Al- 
Istiwai  States. 


78 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  new  policy  for  higher  education  announced  by  the  Sudanese 
government  in  1990,  however,  dictated  that  Arabic  would  be  the  lan¬ 
guage  of  instruction  in  all  institutions  of  higher  learning  (see  Education, 
this  eh.).  This  policy  was  reversed  by  provisions  of  the  Comprehensive 
Peace  Agreement  of  2005  that  were  incorporated  into  Sudan’s  Interim 
National  Constitution.  These  provisions  established  both  Arabic  and 
English  as  official  working  languages  of  the  national  government  and  as 
the  languages  of  instruction  in  higher  education.  The  constitution 
declared  further  that  “all  indigenous  languages  of  the  Sudan  are  national 
languages  and  shall  be  respected,  developed,  and  promoted,”  and  it 
allowed  any  legislative  body  below  the  national  level  to  adopt  any  other 
national  language(s)  as  additional  official  working  language(s)  within 
that  body’s  jurisdiction.  These  changes  began  working  their  way  into 
public  life  and  into  secondary  and  higher  education. 

Ethnic  Groups 

Muslim  Peoples 

An  often-made  distinction  among  Sudan’s  peoples  is  that  between 
Muslim  and  non-Muslim  groups.  While  the  distinction  may  be  valid 
in  terms  of  religion,  both  Muslim  and  non-Muslim  groups  are  enor¬ 
mously  diverse  ethnically,  linguistically,  and  geographically.  The  dis¬ 
tinction,  nonetheless,  remains  a  useful  method  of  classifying  Sudan’s 
variegated  ethnic  landscape  (see  fig.  10). 

Arabs  and  Nubians 

The  term  Arab  is  confusing  to  most  people  because  it  does  not  corre¬ 
spond  to  an  ethnic  or  religious  identity.  For  example,  there  are  at  least 
10  million  Arab  Christians,  mostly  in  Egypt  and  the  Fertile  Crescent,  a 
small  number  of  whom  reside  in  Sudan  as  descendants  of  Orthodox 
Copts  who  arrived  during  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium.  Simi¬ 
larly,  “Arabs”  span  the  racial  spectrum  from  very  light  to  quite  dark  in 
pigmentation,  and  there  are  no  unifying  physiological  characteristics.  In 
fact,  the  League  of  Arab  States  debated  the  issue  of  Arab  identity  for 
years  after  its  establishment  in  1945  and  eventually  decided  that  an 
Arab  was  anyone  whose  mother  tongue  was  Arabic  and  who  “identified 
with  Arab  culture  and  destiny.”  By  this  definition,  approximately  40 
percent  of  Sudan’s  population  is  ethnically  Arab,  but  most  Sudanese 
intellectuals  and  informed  foreign  observers  agree  that  the  more  accu¬ 
rate  description  is  Afro-Arab. 

Further  complicating  the  terminology  have  been  consistent  efforts 
by  non- Arab  politicians,  especially  those  in  the  South  and  some  in  the 
West,  to  describe  the  ruling  elite  as  Arab  in  order  to  appeal  to  presumed

sympathies  of  Western  observers,  when  in  fact  the  indigenous  elite  in 
the  North  is  a  mixture  of  Arabs,  Afro- Arabs,  and  non-Arabs.  Actually, 
Northerners  are  more  divided  than  united  along  tribal,  racial,  religious, 
and  socioeconomic  lines,  a  fact  that  accounts  partially  for  the  failures  of 
successive  governments  to  assert  control  over  outlying  areas  or  to 
move  the  country  forward  economically  and  socially.  A  much  more 
useful  distinction  is,  in  fact,  a  term  that  originated  in  the  nineteenth  cen¬ 
tury  distinguishing  the  awlad  al-bahr  (children  of  the  river)  from  the 
awlad  ar-rif  (children  of  the  countryside),  a  distinction  reflecting  the 


80 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


fact  that  all  central  governments  since  the  1 820s  have  exercised  a  reach 
of  perhaps  no  more  than  a  300-kilometer  radius  from  Khartoum. 

Besides  the  major  distinction  dividing  Arabs  into  sedentary  and 
nomadic  individuals,  there  was  an  old  tradition  that  assigned  them  to 
tribes,  each  said  to  have  a  common  ancestor.  Earlier  reference  works 
distinguished  three  supratribal  categories — the  Juhayna,  Ja’aliyyin,  and 
Kawahla.  Yet  this  listing  is  limited  and  its  inferences  debatable.  The 
Juhayna  category  consisted  of  tribes  considered  nomadic,  although 
many  had  become  fully  settled.  The  Ja’aliyyin  encompassed  the  river¬ 
ine,  sedentary  peoples  from  around  Atbarah  to  just  north  of  Khartoum, 
but  some  of  these  peoples  had  moved  elsewhere.  Some  of  the  groups 
had  become  sedentary  only  in  the  twentieth  century.  Sudanese  saw  the 
Ja’aliyyin  as  primarily  indigenous  peoples  who  were  gradually  Arabi¬ 
zed.  Sudanese  thought  the  Juhayna  were  more  homogeneous,  although 
some  Juhayna  groups  had  become  more  diverse  by  absorbing  indige¬ 
nous  peoples.  The  Baqqara,  for  example,  who  moved  south  and  west 
and  encountered  the  peoples  of  those  areas,  became  scarcely  distin¬ 
guishable  from  them. 

A  third  supratribal  division  of  some  importance  was  the  Kawahla, 
consisting  of  13  tribes  of  varying  size.  Eight  of  these  tribes  and  seg¬ 
ments  of  the  other  five  were  found  north  and  west  of  Khartoum.  These 
people  were  more  heavily  dependent  on  pastoralism  than  were  the 
segments  of  the  other  five  tribes,  who  lived  on  either  side  of  the  White 
Nile  from  south  of  Khartoum  to  north  of  Kosti.  This  cluster  of  five 
groups  (for  practical  purposes,  independent  tribes)  exhibited  a  consid¬ 
erable  degree  of  self-awareness  and  cohesion  in  some  circumstances, 
although  that  had  not  precluded  intertribal  competition  for  local  power 
and  status. 

Membership  in  tribal  and  subtribal  units  is  generally  by  birth,  but 
individuals  and  groups  may  also  join  these  units  by  adoption,  client¬ 
age,  or  a  decision  to  live  and  behave  a  certain  way.  For  example,  when 
a  sedentary  Fur  (“African”)  becomes  a  cattle  nomad,  he  is  perceived  as 
a  Baqqara  (“Arab”).  Eventually,  the  descendants  of  such  newcomers 
are  regarded  as  belonging  to  the  group  by  birth. 

Tribal  and  subtribal  units  divide  the  Arab  ethnic  category  vertically, 
but  other  distinctions,  such  as  social  status  and  power,  cut  across  Arab 
society  and  its  tribal  and  subtribal  components  horizontally.  Still 
another  division  is  that  of  religious  associations. 

A  glance  at  both  Sudan’s  modem  history  and  its  governing  elites 
reveals  the  major  tribal  groupings  in  riverine  Muslim  Sudan  to  be  Nubi¬ 
ans,  Shayqiyyah,  Ja’aliyyin,  and  Shukriyyah.  Many  smaller  groups  that 
are  politically  noteworthy,  e.g.,  the  Hashmab  and  the  Mahha,  are  inter¬ 
spersed  among  them. 


81 


Sudan :  A  Country  Study 


Besides  actual  size,  tribal  influence  can  be  traced  to  educational 
opportunity.  For  example,  “modem,”  i.e.,  public  education  as  distinct 
from  religious  ( khalwa  or  kuttab )  education,  traveled  southward  from 
Egypt  and  initially  reached  Wadi  Flalfa  in  the  far  north  of  Nubia.  It  is 
no  coincidence  that  the  majority  of  the  top  administrators  and  univer¬ 
sity  educators  in  postindependence  Sudan  have  been  Halfawiyyin, 
commonly  known  as  Nubians.  They  are  descendants  of  the  ancient 
Kerman  and  Napatan  populations  and  predate  the  arrival  of  the  Arabs. 

Following  the  flooding  of  Wadi  Haifa  and  the  forced  relocation  of 
40,000  or  so  citizens  to  Khashm  al-Qirbah  near  Kassala  in  the  mid- 
1960s,  plus  internal  migration  to  the  capital  area,  the  center  of  Nubian 
settlement  and  culture  has  been  Dongola;  indeed,  many  “southern” 
Nubians  have  long  been  referred  to  as  Dongolawi.  The  aforementioned 
Mahha  are  their  fellow  Nubian  neighbors.  Other  much  smaller  groups 
speaking  a  related  language  and  claiming  a  link  with  the  Nile  Nubians 
have  been  given  local  names;  some  near  Dongola  have  been  largely 
Arabized  and  are  referred  to  as  Danaqla.  Even  before  the  resettlement, 
many  had  left  the  valley  for  varying  lengths  of  time  to  work  in  towns, 
although  most  sought  to  maintain  a  link  with  their  traditional  home¬ 
land.  In  the  1955-56  census,  more  Nile  Nubians  were  counted  in  Al- 
Khartoum  Province  than  in  the  Nubian  country  to  the  north.  A  similar 
pattern  of  work  in  towns  was  apparently  followed  by  those  resettled  at 
Khashm  al-Qirbah.  Many  Nubians  there  retained  their  ancestral  tenan¬ 
cies  and  had  kin  oversee  their  land  and  the  hiring  of  non-Nubians  to 
work  it.  The  Nubians,  often  with  their  families,  worked  in  Khartoum, 
the  town  of  Kassala,  and  Port  Sudan  in  jobs  ranging  from  domestic  ser¬ 
vice  and  semiskilled  labor  to  teaching  and  civil  service,  which  required 
literacy.  Despite  their  knowledge  of  Arabic  and  devotion  to  Islam, 
Nubians  retained  considerable  group  consciousness  and  tended  to 
maintain  tightly  knit  communities  in  towns.  In  the  mid-1990s,  they 
numbered  close  to  300,000. 

Their  next  significant  neighbors  up  the  Nile  are  the  Shayqiyyah  liv¬ 
ing  in  and  around  Kuraymah,  Merowe,  and  Kurti  (also  seen  as  Korti). 
They  have  been  prominent  in  the  military  officer  corps  and  police  but 
also  in  senior  positions  in  government.  Like  the  Dongolawis  to  the 
northwest,  these  awlad  al-bahr  derive  their  livelihood  from  limited  hor¬ 
ticulture  and  date  palm  groves  and  are  culturally  somewhat  akin  to  resi¬ 
dents  of  Upper  Egypt.  Such  is  not  the  case  with  the  Ja’aliyyin  of  the 
Nile  region  north  and  south  of  the  capital  area.  Traditionally  primarily 
involved  in  agriculture,  these  settled  cultivators  used  to  dominate  cen¬ 
tral  Sudan’s  core  socially,  economically,  and,  to  some  extent,  politically. 

East  of  the  Blue  Nile,  just  south  of  the  capital  region,  is  the  land  of 
the  Shukriyyah,  another  significant  ethnic  group  controlling  both 


82 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


agriculture  along  the  fertile  Blue  Nile  and  grazing  land  in  and  toward 
the  Al-Butanah  area  east  of  the  Nile.  Farther  east  along  the  border 
with  Eritrea  and  Ethiopia  are  the  Rashaida,  a  relatively  “pure”  Arab 
people  who  arrived  from  Saudi  Arabia  in  the  nineteenth  century  and 
are  related  to  the  Juhayna  grouping.  The  Rashaida  are  nomads  who 
migrate  with  their  camels,  sheep,  and  goats  between  Al-Gedaref  and 
Kassala  or  farther  north  in  rhythm  with  the  seasons. 

Another  large  “Arab”  tribal  federation  is  the  Kababish,  mostly  in 
Kordofan.  From  their  home  area  around  Bara,  young  adult  men  have 
been  camel  drivers  who  deliver  large  flocks  via  a  track  through  north¬ 
west  Sudan  to  Upper  Egypt  near  Asyout  and  on  to  Cairo’s  Imbaba 
camel  market.  This  activity  has  become  legendary  as  the  Darb  al-Arba’ 
(the  Forty  Days  Road),  providing  meat  to  hungry  Egypt  and  economic 
prosperity  to  the  Kababish  and  others  in  Kordofan.  Farther  west  is  the 
Hamar  confederation,  whose  lifestyles  and  activities  closely  parallel 
those  of  the  Kababish. 

To  the  southwest  are  the  Misiriyyah  and  Rizayqat  tribal  federations, 
also  seminomadic  and  also  famous  mostly  for  raising  camels  and  sheep. 
Both  straddle  the  border  between  South  Kordorfan  and  South  Darfur. 
Of  these,  the  Misiriyyah  may  be  the  more  significant  because  of  their 
numbers — they  are  subdivided  into  two  distinct  federations  with  a  dis¬ 
tinct  difference  in  skin  pigmentation — and  also  because  of  their  grazing 
locations  near  the  northernmost  Dinka  grouping,  the  Abyei  Dinka, 
whose  territory  is  a  “Southern”  enclave  in  “Northern”  Sudan.  Through¬ 
out  the  twentieth  century,  reports  of  Misiriyyah  encroachment  on  tradi¬ 
tional  Rizayqat  or  Abyei  Dinka  land,  particularly  during  periods  of 
drought,  led  to  intercommunal  fighting  and  loss  of  life  and  livestock. 
More  recently,  the  Misiriyyah  and  Rizayqat  have  been  mentioned  in 
connection  with  the  infamous  janjaweed  (see  Glossary),  ethnic  militias 
armed  by  the  central  government  to  subdue  the  Darfuri  rebels  (see  The 
War  in  Darfur,  2003-1 1 ,  ch.  5).  It  is  too  early  to  conclude  whether  there 
is  direct  involvement  of  these  groups  or  if  these  allegations  reflect  long¬ 
time  animosities. 

Beja 

The  Beja  probably  have  lived  in  the  Red  Sea  Hills  since  ancient 
times.  Arab  influence  was  not  significant  until  a  millennium  or  so  ago, 
but  it  has  since  led  the  Beja  to  adopt  Islam  and  genealogies  that  link 
them  to  Arab  ancestors,  to  Arabize  their  names,  and  to  include  many 
Arabic  terms  in  their  language.  Although  some  Arabs  figure  in  the 
ancestry  of  the  Beja,  the  group  is  mostly  descended  from  an  indigenous 
population,  and  they  have  not  become  Arabized.  Their  language, 
Bedawiye,  links  them  to  other  Cushitic-speaking  peoples  farther  south. 


83 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Most  Beja  belong  to  one  of  four  groups — the  Bisharin,  the  Amarar, 
the  Hadendowa,  and  the  Bani  Amir.  The  largest  group  is  the  Haden- 
dowa,  but  the  Bisharin  have  the  most  territory,  living  as  settled  tribes 
on  the  Atbarah  River  in  the  far  south  of  the  Beja  range  and  as  nomads 
in  the  north.  A  good  number  of  the  Hadendowa  are  also  settled  and 
engaged  in  agriculture,  particularly  in  the  coastal  region  near  Tawkar, 
but  many  remain  nomads.  The  Amarar,  living  in  the  central  part  of  the 
Beja  range,  seem  to  be  largely  nomadic,  as  are  the  second  largest 
group,  the  Bani  Amir,  who  live  along  the  border  with  Eritrea.  The  pre¬ 
cise  proportion  of  nomads  in  the  Beja  population  in  the  early  2000s 
was  not  known,  but  it  was  far  greater  than  the  nomadic  component  of 
the  Arab  population. 

The  Beja  are  characterized  as  conservative,  proud,  and  aloof  even 
toward  other  Beja  and  quite  reticent  in  relations  with  strangers.  They 
were  long  reluctant  to  accept  the  authority  of  central  governments  and 
have  been  organized,  off-and-on,  in  the  Beja  Congress  as  a  movement 
to  advance  their  regional  agenda  (see  Eastern  Sudan,  eh.  4).  Estimates 
of  their  number  in  the  early  2000s  ranged  upward  of  2  million.  In 
recent  years,  and  in  response  to  a  declining  rural  economy  and  to  war¬ 
fare,  many  Beja  have  settled  in  urban  areas  such  as  Port  Sudan, 
Sawakin  (also  seen  as  Suakin),  and  Kassala,  some  as  refugees,  and 
others  as  laborers  in  the  oil-export  sector. 

Fur 

The  Fur,  ruled  from  the  seventeenth  century  until  1 9 1 6  by  an  inde¬ 
pendent  sultanate  that  controlled  east-west  trade  and  oriented  politi¬ 
cally  and  culturally  to  peoples  in  Chad,  are  a  sedentary  group  long 
settled  on  and  around  the  Jabal  Marrah,  where  they  cultivate  millet, 
sorghum,  and  peanuts.  Although  the  ruling  dynasty  and  the  peoples  of 
the  area  have  long  been  Muslims,  they  have  not  been  Arabized;  their 
integration  into  larger  Sudanese  society  has  been  incomplete  and  trou¬ 
bled.  Livestock  have  played  a  small  part  in  the  subsistence  of  most 
Fur.  Those  who  acquired  a  substantial  herd  of  cattle  could  maintain  it 
only  by  living  like  the  neighboring  Baqqara  Arabs,  and  those  who 
persisted  in  this  pattern  eventually  came  to  be  thought  of  as  Baqqara. 
In  the  late  1980s  (the  latest  available  estimate),  the  Fur  numbered 
about  500,000. 

Although  the  Fur  are  the  largest  indigenous  “nation”  in  Darfur — 
the  province  was  named  after  them — they  have  felt  marginalized 
since  before  independence.  Some  of  their  leaders  have  organized  local 
movements  calling  for  more  autonomy  or  better  services  from  Khar¬ 
toum.  These  movements,  such  as  the  Suny  Liberation  Front  of  the 
1960s  and  1970s  (named  after  the  town  of  Suny,  near  Jabal  Marrah), 
sporadically  took  up  arms  against  the  central  government.  Gaining  in 


84 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


strength  in  the  late  1980s,  adherents  of  these  movements,  organized  as 
the  Sudan  Liberation  Army  (SLA),  struck  with  a  vengeance  in  Febru¬ 
ary  2003  against  government  positions  in  the  provincial  capital,  Al- 
Fashir.  A  so-called  Black  Book  detailed  the  perceived  marginalization 
of  the  Darfuri  peoples. 

Zaghawa 

Living  on  the  desert  plateau  north  of  the  Fur  are  the  seminomadic 
people  calling  themselves  Beri  but  known  to  the  Arabs  as  Zaghawa  or 
Bideyat.  Large  numbers  of  the  group  also  live  in  Chad.  Altogether, 
they  numbered  an  estimated  122,000  in  the  late  1980s  (latest  avail¬ 
able  figure). 

Herders  of  cattle,  camels,  sheep,  and  goats,  the  Zaghawa  also  gain  a 
major  part  of  their  subsistence  by  gathering  wild  grains  and  tubers. 
Zaghawa  are  settled  in  villages  as  cultivators  of  millet  and  vegetables; 
some  are  merchants  who  exchange  animals  for  foodstuffs  and  manu¬ 
factures.  Adequate  rainfall  and  access  to  water  sources  are  perennial 
concerns.  The  long-lasting  civil  war  in  Chad,  the  years  of  drought  from 
the  1980s  onward,  plus  increasing  desertification  all  led  to  communal 
infighting  among  neighboring  tribes,  both  Arab  and  non- Arab  through¬ 
out  the  mid-1990s. 

Converted  to  Islam  from  the  seventeenth  century  and  traditionally 
Ansar  (see  Glossary),  the  Zaghawa  were  among  those  groups  who 
were  targeted  by  emissaries  identified  with  a  branch  of  Hassan  Abdal¬ 
lah  al-Turabi’s  National  Islamic  Front  (see  Islamic  Movements  and 
Religious  Orders,  this  eh.;  The  Al-Bashir  Era,  ch.  4).  A  rebel  group, 
heavily  Zaghawa  and  calling  itself  the  Justice  and  Equality  Movement, 
joined  the  Sudan  Liberation  Army  organized  by  the  Fur  in  attacks  on 
government  forces  in  2004.  The  Zaghawa  are  cognizant  of  their  cul¬ 
tural  identity  and  determined  to  preserve  their  well-being  and  political 
independence. 

Masalit y  Berti,  and  Daju 

There  are  other  peoples  living  in  Darfur  in  the  early  2000s  who 
speak  Nilo-Saharan  languages  and  are  at  least  nominally  Muslim,  the 
most  important  being  the  Masalit,  Berti,  and  Daju.  All  are  primarily 
cultivators  living  in  permanent  villages,  but  they  also  practice  animal 
husbandry  in  varying  degrees.  The  Masalit,  living  on  both  sides  of  the 
Sudan-Chad  border,  are  the  largest  group,  numbering  240,000  in  the 
early  2000s.  Small  groups  are  found  as  far  east  as  Al-Gedaref  as  a  result 
of  labor  migration.  Historically  under  a  minor  sultanate,  they  were  posi¬ 
tioned  between  the  two  dominant  sultanates  of  the  area,  Darfur  and 
Wadai  (in  Chad)  and  have  long  fiercely  guarded  their  independence.

They  grow  millet,  sorghum,  peanuts,  and  vegetables,  some  of  which 
they  trade  with  Arab  nomads  and  townsmen.  In  recent  decades,  the 
Masalit,  like  their  neighbors,  have  been  adversely  affected  by  drought 
and  desertification. 

A  part  of  the  territory  they  occupy  was  controlled  formerly  by  the 
Fur,  but  the  Masalit  gradually  encroached  on  it  in  the  first  half  of  the 
twentieth  century  in  a  series  of  local  skirmishes  carried  out  by  villagers 
on  both  sides  rather  than  by  the  sultanates.  In  1990-96  much  of  Darfur 
was  in  a  state  of  anarchy;  there  were  many  instances  in  which  Masalit 
militias  attacked  Fur  and  other  villages.  In  2003  the  Masalit  were 
among  the  early  victims  of  raids  by  the  government-allied  janjaweed. 

The  Berti  consist  of  two  groups.  One  lives  northeast  of  Al-Fashir; 
the  other  migrated  to  eastern  Darfur  and  western  Kordofan  in  the  eigh¬ 
teenth  century.  Small  groups  are  scattered  across  northern  Sudan. 
Members  of  the  western  group,  in  addition  to  cultivating  subsistence 
crops  and  practicing  animal  husbandry,  gather  gum  arabic  for  sale  in 
local  markets.  They  are  more  relaxed  in  their  Islamic  observances  than 
some  of  their  neighbors.  The  Berti  tongue  has  given  way  to  Arabic  as  a 
home  language. 

The  term  Daju  applies  to  three  groups  of  sedentary  agriculturalists 
situated  in  southern  Kordofan,  southwestern  Darfur,  and  eastern  Chad. 
These  groups  call  themselves  by  different  names  and  exhibit  no  sense 
of  common  identity.  In  the  early  2000s,  they  totaled  143,000.  Con¬ 
verted  to  Islam  in  the  fifteenth  century  or  earlier,  they  are  not  strict  in 
their  religious  observances.  The  Daju  are  renowned  as  warriors  and 
have  long  quarreled  with  their  neighbors. 

West  Africans 

A  large  number  of  people  of  West  African  origin  also  live  in  Sudan. 
In  the  mid-1970s,  West  Africans  were  estimated  at  more  than  10  per¬ 
cent  of  the  population  of  the  northern  states.  Some  were  descendants 
of  persons  who  arrived  at  least  five  generations  earlier;  others  were 
recent  immigrants.  Some  had  come  in  self-imposed  exile  to  escape 
European  colonial  rule  in  their  homeland.  Others  were  once  pilgrims 
to  Mecca,  settling  either  en  route  or  on  their  return.  Many  came  over 
decades  in  the  course  of  the  great  dispersion  of  the  nomadic  Fulani; 
others  arrived,  particularly  after  World  War  II,  as  rural  and  urban 
laborers  or  to  take  up  land  as  peasant  cultivators. 

A  large  percentage  of  people  included  in  the  West  African  category 
are  said  to  be  of  Nigerian  origin  (locally  called  Bomo,  after  the  Nige¬ 
rian  emirate  that  was  their  homeland).  Given  Hausa  dominance  in 
northern  Nigeria,  the  widespread  use  of  their  language  there  and  else¬ 
where,  and  the  propensity  of  the  Hausa  to  go  on  the  hajj,  many  West 


86 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Africans  in  Sudan  are  identified  as  Hausa,  when  in  fact  many  are  proba¬ 
bly  ethnically  Fulani.  The  Hausa  themselves,  particularly  those  long  in 
Sudan,  prefer  to  be  called  Takari.  In  the  early  2000s,  they  were  thought 
to  number  almost  500,000.  The  Fulani,  even  more  widely  dispersed 
throughout  West  Africa,  may  have  originated  in  states  other  than  Nige¬ 
ria.  Typically,  the  term  applied  to  the  Fulani  in  Sudan  is  Fallata,  but 
Sudanese  also  use  that  term  for  other  West  Africans.  In  the  early  1980s, 
they  numbered  90,000. 

Fulani  nomads  are  found  in  many  parts  of  central  Sudan  from  Darfur 
to  the  Blue  Nile,  and  they  occasionally  compete  with  indigenous  popu¬ 
lations  for  pasturage.  In  Darfur,  groups  of  Fulani  origin  have  adapted  in 
various  ways  to  the  presence  of  the  Baqqara  tribes.  Some  have  retained 
all  aspects  of  their  culture  and  language.  A  few  have  become  much  like 
Baqqara  in  language  and  in  other  respects,  although  they  tend  to  retain 
their  own  breeds  of  cattle  and  ways  of  handling  them.  Some  of  the 
Fulani  groups  in  the  eastern  states  are  sedentary,  descendants  of  settled 
Fulani  of  the  ruling  group  in  northern  Nigeria.  Many  recognize  a  “sul¬ 
tan”  as  their  leader,  who  is  accorded  privileges  by  the  central  govern¬ 
ment  of  Sudan. 

Non-Muslim  Peoples 

There  are  a  few  expatriates  temporarily  residing  in  Sudan;  other¬ 
wise  all  non-Muslims  are  Christians  or  animists.  In  earlier  times,  these 
terms  were  employed  by  virtually  all  Sudanese,  and  they  referred 
essentially  to  the  peoples  of  the  South.  By  201 1  this  was  no  longer  the 
case.  The  term  animist  is  disputed;  some  scholars  prefer  indigenous  or 
traditional  religions.  However,  such  nomenclature  can  be  confusing  as 
well  because  many  Muslims  consider  that  these  terms  also  apply  to 
them.  Indeed,  Muslims  prefer  to  view  religious  identity  as  “People  of 
the  Book”  (ahl  al-kitab ),  meaning  essentially  Jews,  Christians,  and 
Muslims,  as  opposed  to  all  others. 

Moreover,  given  recent  migrations  and  displacements,  it  is  now 
estimated  that  as  many  Southerners  live  in  the  North  as  in  the  tradi¬ 
tional  South  and  that  a  number  have  been  there  long  enough  to  have 
become  acculturated  within  the  Muslim-dominated  areas  of  the  North. 
Furthermore,  speculation  continues  among  all  parties  as  to  how  many 
Southern  migrants  in  the  North  will  return  to  their  ancestral  homelands 
given  the  impending  independence  of  the  South.  The  majority  opinion 
is  that  only  those  Southerners  with  assets  in  the  South — land,  houses, 
animals,  and  relatives — will  go  back;  a  substantial  number  who  found 
employment  in  cities  in  the  North  are  likely  to  remain  there. 

Primordial  identities,  such  as  family,  clan,  and  tribe,  tend  to  dominate 
here  as  in  most  developing  countries.  Migrants  tend  to  cluster  around 


87

their  own  kind,  and,  consequently,  ethnic  identity  remains  strong.  In  that 
sense,  the  major  identities  of  the  old  non-Muslim  groups  remain  observ¬ 
able,  regardless  of  assimilation  and  religious  “conversion.”  From  that 
perspective,  the  remaining  categories  of  ethnic  groupings  to  be  listed  are 
the  dominant  Nilotes  of  the  central  South,  smaller  tribes  in  the  southern¬ 
most  and  southwestern  South,  and  some  small  groups  residing  in  the 
hilly  areas  south  of  the  Blue  Nile  on  or  near  the  border  with  Ethiopia. 
Another  cluster  of  peoples  commonly  called  the  Nuba,  but  socially  and 
culturally  diverse,  live  in  the  Nuba  Mountains  of  South  Kordofan  State. 
Their  region  became  pivotal  in  the  negotiations  leading  to  the  peace 
agreement  of  January  2005. 

Nilotes 

“Nilote”  is  a  common  name  for  many  of  the  peoples  living  on  or 
near  the  Nile  and  its  tributaries  in  the  southern  third  of  Sudan.  The 
term  refers  to  people  speaking  languages  of  one  section  of  the  Nilotic 
subbranch  of  the  Eastern  Sudanic  branch  of  Nilo-Saharan  and  sharing 
a  myth  of  common  origin.  They  are  marked  by  physical  similarity  and 
many  common  cultural  features.  Many  have  a  long  tradition  of  keep¬ 
ing  cattle,  including  some  for  whom  cattle  are  no  longer  of  practical 
importance.  Because  of  their  adaptation  to  different  climates  and  their 
encounters,  peaceful  and  otherwise,  with  other  peoples,  there  is  also 
some  diversity  among  the  Nilotes. 

The  Nilotes  still  constitute  more  than  three-fifths  of  the  population  of 
the  South  in  the  early  2000s  despite  civil  war  and  famine.  One  group, 
the  Dinka,  or  Jieng,  numbering  perhaps  2.5  million  to  3  million,  make 
up  roughly  two-thirds  of  the  total  category  and  about  10  percent  of 
Sudan’s  population.  The  Dinka  are  the  single  largest  “nation”  in  Sudan 
and  are  widely  distributed  over  the  northern  portion  of  Southern  Sudan, 
particularly  in  North  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  West  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  Lakes, 
and  Jonglei  States.  The  next  largest  group,  only  one-third  to  one-quarter 
the  size  of  the  Dinka,  are  the  Nuer,  or  Naadh,  concentrated  in  Upper 
Nile  State.  The  Shilluk,  or  Collo,  the  third  largest  group,  have  only 
about  one-fourth  as  many  people  as  the  Nuer,  numbering  about  185,000 
in  the  late  1980s.  The  remaining  Nilotic  groups  are  much  smaller. 

The  larger  and  more  dispersed  the  group,  however,  the  more  inter¬ 
nally  varied  it  has  become.  The  Dinka  and  Nuer,  for  example,  did  not 
develop  a  centralized  government  encompassing  all  or  any  large  part 
of  their  groups.  The  Dinka  are  considered  to  have  as  many  as  25  sub- 
tribal  groups,  each  autonomous  within  a  well-defined  region.  The 
Nuer  have  nine  or  10  separately  named  groups. 

Armed  conflict  between  and  within  Southern  ethnic  groups  is 
long-standing  and  continued  into  the  twenty-first  century  in  the  con¬ 
text  of  the  North-South  struggle.  Sections  of  the  Dinka  have  fought

sections  of  the  Nuer  and  each  other.  Other  Southern  groups  have  also 
expanded  and  contracted  in  the  search  for  cattle  and  pasturage.  The 
Nuer  have  absorbed  some  of  the  Dinka  to  the  extent  that  some  pres¬ 
ent-day  sections  of  the  Nuer  have  significant  Dinka  components. 

Relations  among  various  Southern  groups  were  affected  in  the  nine¬ 
teenth  century  by  the  intrusion  of  Ottomans,  Arabs,  and  eventually  the 
British.  Some  ethnic  groups  made  their  accommodation  with  the  intrud¬ 
ers  and  others  did  not,  in  effect  pitting  one  Southern  ethnic  group  against 
another  in  the  context  of  foreign  rule.  For  example,  some  sections  of  the 
Dinka  were  more  accommodating  to  British  rule  than  were  the  Nuer. 
These  Dinka  treated  the  resisting  Nuer  as  hostile,  and  hostility  devel¬ 
oped  between  the  two  groups  as  a  result  of  their  differing  relationships 
to  the  British.  The  achievement  of  Sudanese  independence  in  1956  and 
the  adoption  of  certain  aspects  of  Islamic  law,  or  sharia,  by  the  central 
government  in  September  1983  greatly  influenced  the  nature  of  rela¬ 
tions  among  these  groups  in  modem  times.  The  second  Southern  civil 
war,  launched  in  April  1983  by  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Move¬ 
ment/Army  (SPLM/A),  was  perceived  by  many  as  Dinka-centered 
because  its  primary  leader,  John  Garang  de  Mabior,  and  most  of  its  foot 
soldiers  were,  in  fact,  Dinka  (see  Second  Southern  Civil  War,  1 983— 
2005,  ch.  5).

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  next  largest  group  of  Nilotes,  the  Shilluk  (who  refer  to  them¬ 
selves  as  Collo),  are  not  dispersed  like  the  Dinka  and  the  Nuer,  but 
rather  settled  mainly  in  a  limited,  uninterrupted  area  along  the  west 
bank  of  the  White  Nile,  just  north  of  Malakal.  Some  also  live  on  the 
eastern  bank.  With  easy  access  to  fairly  good  land  along  the  Nile,  they 
rely  much  more  heavily  on  cultivation  and  fishing  than  the  Dinka  and 
the  Nuer  do,  and  they  have  fewer  cattle.  The  Shilluk  have  truly  perma¬ 
nent  settlements  and  do  not  move  regularly  between  cultivating  and 
cattle  camps. 

Unlike  the  larger  groups,  the  Shilluk  along  the  Upper  Nile  were  tra¬ 
ditionally  ruled  by  a  single  politico-religious  head  (reth),  believed  to 
become  at  the  time  of  his  investiture  as  king  the  representative,  if  not 
the  reincarnation,  of  the  mythical  hero  Nyiking,  putative  founder  of  the 
Shilluk.  The  administrative  and  political  powers  of  the  reth  have  been 
the  subject  of  some  debate,  but  his  ritual  status  was  clear  enough:  his 
health  was  believed  to  be  closely  related  to  the  material  and  spiritual 
welfare  of  the  Shilluk.  It  is  likely  that  the  territorial  unity  of  the  Shilluk 
and  the  permanence  of  their  settlements  contributed  to  the  centraliza¬ 
tion  of  their  political  and  ritual  structures.  In  the  late  1980s,  activities 
against  the  SPLA  by  armed  militias  supported  by  the  government  seri¬ 
ously  alienated  the  Shilluk  in  Malakal,  and  the  pattern  of  intra-Southem 
fighting  has  continued  off-and-on  into  the  present  century. 

Bari,  Kuku ,  Kakwa,  and  Mandari 

Several  peoples  living  mainly  to  the  south  and  east  of  the  Nilotes 
speak  languages  of  another  section  of  the  Nilotic  subbranch  of  Eastern 
Sudanic.  Primary  among  them  are  the  Bari  and  the  closely  related 
Kuku,  Kakwa,  and  Mandari  (Mundari),  who  speak  dialects  of  Bari. 
The  Bari  and  Mandari,  who  live  along  the  Nile  around  Juba  and  hence 
close  to  Nilotes,  have  been  influenced  by  them  and  have  sometimes 
been  in  conflict  with  them.  The  more  southerly  Kuku  live  in  highlands 
along  the  Uganda  border,  and  the  Kakwa  inhabit  the  rain  forest  around 
Yei.  All  of  these  groups  engage  in  subsistence  agriculture,  sorghum, 
maize,  and  peanuts  being  standard  crops.  The  Kuku  and  Mandari  also 
keep  cattle.  All  have  been  severely  affected  by  years  of  strife  and  have 
fled  into  towns  or  into  Uganda,  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the 
Congo,  or  even  farther  afield. 

Murle ,  Didinga ,  and  Others 

Two  other  tribes,  the  Murle  and  the  Didinga,  speak  Eastern  Sudanic 
languages  of  sub-branches  other  than  Nilotic.  The  Murle  dwelled  in 
southern  Ethiopia  in  the  nineteenth  century,  and  some  are  still  there. 
Others  moved  west  and  drove  out  the  local  Nilotes,  whom  they  report- 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


edly  regarded  with  contempt,  in  the  process  acquiring  a  reputation  as 
warriors.  The  Murle  are  predominantly  pastoral.  Their  social  and  cul¬ 
tural  life  revolves  around  cattle,  and  they  are  renowned  among  their 
neighbors  for  cattle  raiding.  They  are  also  skilled  hunters.  Their  loyal¬ 
ties  were  divided  between  Northerners  and  Southerners  during  the 
civil  war. 

The  Didinga  inhabit  hill  country  on  the  border  with  Kenya.  Primar¬ 
ily  agriculturalists,  they  grow  maize,  beans,  millet,  and  tobacco.  They 
also  pan  for  alluvial  gold.  The  relative  isolation  of  the  Didinga  Hills 
has  helped  them  preserve  their  cultural  traditions,  although  they  joined 
the  SPLM/A  in  opposition  to  the  forces  of  the  national  government. 

Along  the  mountainous  border  with  Ethiopia  in  Blue  Nile  and  Sin- 
nar  States  live  several  small  heterogeneous  groups.  Some,  such  as  the 
Uduk,  speak  languages  of  the  Koman  division  of  Nilo- Saharan  and  are 
believed  to  have  been  in  the  area  since  antiquity.  Others,  including  the 
Ingessana,  were  refugees  driven  into  the  hills  by  the  expansion  of 
other  groups.  In  the  past,  most  of  these  peoples  straddling  the  Sudan- 
Ethiopia  border  experienced  strife  with  later-arriving  neighbors  and 
slave  raids  by  the  Arabs.  All  adapted  by  learning  the  language  of  more 
dominant  groups. 

Azande 

In  West  Equatoria  and  West  Bahr  al-Ghazal  States  live  a  number  of 
small,  sometimes  fragmented  groups  who  speak  languages  of  the 
Adamawa-Ubangi  branch  of  the  Niger-Congo  language  family.  The 
largest  of  these  groups  are  the  Azande,  who  constitute  perhaps  7  to  8 
percent  of  the  population  of  the  South  and  are  the  dominant  group  in 
West  Equatoria. 

The  Azande  emerged  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries 
when  groups  of  hunters,  divided  into  aristocrats  and  commoners, 
entered  the  northeastern  part  of  present-day  Democratic  Republic  of  the 
Congo,  and  later  southwestern  Sudan  and  southeastern  Central  African 
Republic,  and  conquered  peoples  already  there.  Although  the  aristocrats 
provided  ruling  kings  and  nobles,  they  did  not  establish  an  inclusive, 
centralized  state.  The  means  of  succession  to  kingship,  however, 
encouraged  Azande  expansion.  A  man  succeeded  to  his  father’s  throne 
only  when  he  had  vanquished  those  of  his  brothers  who  chose  to  com¬ 
pete  for  it.  The  brothers — princes  without  land  or  people  but  with  fol¬ 
lowers  looking  for  the  fruits  of  conquest — would  find  and  rule  hitherto 
unconquered  groups.  Such  expansion  brought  them  into  conflict  with 
their  neighbors,  in  particular,  the  Dinka,  whom  they  failed  to  subdue.  In 
this  manner,  the  Azande  became  a  heterogeneous  people.  The  Azande 
traditionally  lived  in  scattered  homesteads  and  engaged  in  subsistence 


91

fanning.  Their  crops  included  maize,  cassava,  yams,  coffee,  and  a  vari¬ 
ety  of  fruit.  Oracles  and  witchcraft  played  important  roles  in  their  social 
relations. 

Their  earlier  military  and  political  successes  notwithstanding,  the 
Azande  in  the  twentieth  century  were  poor,  largely  dependent  on  culti¬ 
vation  (hunting  was  no  longer  a  feasible  source  of  food),  and  afflicted 
by  sleeping  sickness.  In  an  attempt  to  mitigate  these  problems,  British 
colonial  authorities  instituted  a  development  project  known  as  the 
Azande  Scheme,  involving  cotton  growing  and  resettlement.  The  pro¬ 
gram  failed,  however,  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  an  inadequate 
understanding  of  Azande  society,  economy,  and  values  on  the  part  of 
the  colonial  planners.  Partly  in  an  effort  to  escape  sleeping  sickness, 
many  Azande  moved  into  villages,  away  from  kin  and  former  social 
networks.  Some  became  Christians  and  Muslims.  At  the  same  time, 
they  experienced  a  declining  birthrate.  Azande  support  of  the  Anya 
Nya  guerrilla  groups,  as  well  as  conflicts  with  the  Dinka,  also  served 
to  worsen  the  plight  of  the  Azande.  In  the  late  1980s,  those  in  Sudan 
were  thought  to  number  about  350,000.  As  a  result  of  warfare  in  the 
South  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  many  Azande  fled  into  neighboring 
countries,  further  disrupting  their  former  cultural  practices. 

Bviri,  Ndogo,  and  Others 

Several  other  groups  of  cultivators  in  southwestern  Sudan  speak  lan¬ 
guages  closely  akin  to  that  of  the  Azande  but  lack  a  dominant  group. 
The  most  important  seem  to  be  the  Bviri.  They  and  a  smaller  group 
called  Ndogo  speak  a  language  named  after  the  latter;  other  smaller 
communities  speak  dialects  of  that  tongue.  These  communities  do  not 
share  a  sense  of  common  ethnic  identity,  however. 

The  other  groups  in  southwestern  Sudan  speak  languages  of  the  cen¬ 
tral  branch  of  Nilo-Saharan  and  are  scattered  from  West  Bahr  al-Ghazal 
(the  Kreish)  to  Central  Equatoria  (the  Morn  and  the  Avukaya)  to  East 
Equatoria  (the  Madi).  In  between,  in  Central  Equatoria,  are  such  peo¬ 
ples  as  the  Bongo  and  the  Baka.  The  languages  of  Morn  and  Madi  are 
so  close,  as  are  aspects  of  their  cultures,  that  they  are  sometimes  consid¬ 
ered  as  one.  The  same  is  true  of  the  Bongo  and  the  Baka,  but  there  is  no 
indication  that  either  pair  constitutes  a  self-conscious  ethnic  group. 

Nuba 

Living  in  the  Nuba  Mountains  of  South  Kordofan  are  perhaps  three 
dozen  or  more  small  groups  collectively  called  the  Nuba.  They  vary 
considerably  in  their  culture  and  social  organization  and  are  anything 
but  a  unitary  ethnic  group.  For  example,  some  are  patrilineally  orga¬ 
nized,  others  adhere  to  matrilineal  patterns,  and  a  very  few — the 


92 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


southeastern  Nuba — have  both  patrilineal  and  matrilineal  groupings  in 
the  same  community.  The  large  number  of  Kordofanian  languages 
these  people  speak  are  not  generally  mutually  intelligible,  except  by 
some  adjacent  communities.  Judging  partly  from  this  linguistic  diver¬ 
sity,  it  would  appear  that  a  number  of  disparate  peoples  now  known  as 
the  Nuba  moved  into  the  hill  country  of  South  Kordofan  over  the  cen¬ 
turies  in  search  of  security.  Even  so,  the  Nuba  were  subjected  to  raids 
by  Arab  slavers,  and,  more  recently,  to  encroachment  by  neighbors 
who  coveted  their  fertile  land. 

Despite  the  Arabization  of  the  people  around  them,  only  small  num¬ 
bers  of  Nuba  have  adopted  Arabic  as  a  home  language,  and  even  fewer 
have  converted  to  Islam.  Some  have  become  Christian,  but  most  retain 
either  traditional  or  dual  religious  identities.  Quite  a  few  Nuba,  how¬ 
ever,  serve  in  the  armed  forces  and  police.  Most  remain  cultivators; 
animal  husbandry  plays  only  a  small  part  in  their  economy. 

When  the  George  W.  Bush  administration  came  into  office  in  the 
United  States  in  early  2001,  it  made  peace  in  Sudan  a  high  priority. 
That  September,  a  special  envoy,  former  Senator  John  Danforth  of  Mis¬ 
souri,  was  charged  with  developing  a  comprehensive  peace  plan.  Sena¬ 
tor  Danforth’s  team  decided  to  focus  on  the  Nuba  Mountains  region  as 
a  test  case  because  of  its  central  location  and  its  demographically 
mixed  population.  The  Nuba  were  seen  as  a  potential  bridge  between 
North  and  South,  having  been  claimed  by  both.  The  contesting  military 
units  of  the  government  and  SPLA  withdrew  from  this  area,  and  inter¬ 
national  observers  were  brought  in  to  monitor  adherence  to  military 
and  political  agreements.  These  steps  led  to  confidence-building  mea¬ 
sures  that  eventually  were  extended  to  regional  and  national  power 
sharing,  including  administration  and  division  of  resources.  The  pro¬ 
cess,  heavily  supported  by  the  Bush  administration,  culminated  in  the 
peace  agreement  of  2005  (see  Institutions  of  Government,  eh.  4).  In  an 
indirect  sense,  the  formerly  marginalized  Nuba  may  have  contributed 
in  a  major  way  to  national  reconciliation. 

Regionalism  and  Ethnicity 

There  were  in  the  early  2000s,  at  a  minimum,  five  distinct  regional 
identities  in  Sudan,  which  in  a  country  of  such  enormous  size  was  not 
surprising.  The  South,  West,  East,  and  North  all  considered  themselves 
to  have  been  marginalized  by  the  Center,  and  in  that  order  of  disaffec¬ 
tion.  To  the  outside  observer,  these  claims  seemed  valid,  but  they  were 
frequently  overstated  by  politicians  who  dramatized  the  situation  in 
order  to  curry  local  favor.  Whereas  politicians  from  the  South,  for 
example,  spoke  of  discrimination,  officials  in  the  North  denied  it.  The 
Western  reader  might  think  of  regionalism  in  Canada,  Spain,  Italy,  or

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Britain,  with  the  difference  that  these  countries  have  vastly  greater 
resources  and  infrastructures  to  address  such  complaints.  The  phrase 
benign  neglect  would  seem  to  be  more  appropriate  in  Sudan,  because 
the  leadership  in  the  central  region  was  completely  preoccupied  with 
local  infighting  and  maneuvering  and  had  little  energy  left  over  to 
address  legitimate  concerns  of  the  more  distant  regions,  especially  con¬ 
sidering  the  meager  resources  available  to  Sudanese  governments  in 
the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries. 

The  few  educated  leaders  from  the  South,  West  (Darfur),  and  East 
have  parlayed  these  issues  into  regional  movements,  both  political  and 
military,  while  some  of  their  colleagues  adopted  the  Northern  (region) 
strategy  of  moving  to  the  Center  and  cooperating  with  or  being  co¬ 
opted  by  the  national  leadership.  Indeed,  every  Sudanese  government 
since  independence  contained  representatives  from  all  these  regions, 
albeit  often  as  tokens  in  relatively  minor  ministerial  portfolios. 

An  additional  complicating  factor  was  the  tendency  of  Sudan’s 
national  army  to  recruit  heavily  from  impoverished  areas,  as  happens 
in  many  other  countries.  Early  on,  Beja  and  Nuba  joined  in  such  large 
numbers  that  they  are  said  to  provide  the  majority  of  foot  soldiers  in 
recent  years.  Consequently,  when  rebel  movements  attacked  govern¬ 
ment  positions  in  1983  in  the  South  and  later  across  the  Ethiopian  bor¬ 
der  and  in  Darfur  in  2003,  many  if  not  most  of  the  government  soldiers 
came  from  those  very  areas.  Senior  officials  apparently  questioned 
whether  these  troops  could  be  counted  upon  to  fire  “on  their  own  rela¬ 
tives,”  and  several  leaders  in  Khartoum  decided  to  confront  these 
rebellions  instead  by  arming  traditional  enemies  of  the  insurgents  as 
militias.  The  result  was  Southern  tribes  (non-Dinka)  versus  Southern 
insurgents  (the  Dinka-heavy  SPLA),  Darfuri  militias  (non-Fur)  against 
the  Fur-heavy  SLA,  and  non-Zaghawa  against  the  Zaghawa-dominated 
Justice  and  Equality  Movement  (JEM;  see  Regional  Dynamics  and 
Conflict,  ch.  4). 

The  result  of  all  these  developments  was  further  fragmentation  of 
regional  identity,  but  increased  tribal  loyalty.  In  the  2000s,  it  was  no 
longer  accurate  to  describe  the  confrontations  as  Arab  Northerners  ver¬ 
sus  African  Southerners,  but  rather  as  infighting  among  Northern  fac¬ 
tions  over  control  of  the  Center,  whereas  some  Southern  tribes  have 
aligned  with  the  government  in  Khartoum  against  their  Southern  neigh¬ 
bors.  The  same  is  true  in  Darfur,  where  some  groups  have  attacked 
government  positions,  and  Khartoum  responded  by  arming  other  Dar¬ 
furi  with  a  history  of  either  traditional  or  recent  (1990s  skirmishes) 
enmity  toward  the  SLA  and  JEM.  What  may  have  been  common  Dar¬ 
furi  grievances  due  to  marginalization  by  KJiartoum  have  been  super- 
ceded  by  life  and  death  struggles  pitting  Darfuris  against  each  other.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


All  this  is  not  to  deny  the  continuance  of  some  ancient  preconcep¬ 
tions,  because  North-South  hostilities  predate  the  colonial  era.  In  the 
nineteenth  century  and  earlier,  many  Arabs  saw  the  South  as  a  source 
for  slaves  and  considered  its  peoples  inferior  by  virtue  of  their  paganism 
if  not  their  color.  Organized  slave  raiding  ended  in  the  late  nineteenth 
century,  but  the  residue  of  bitterness  remained  among  Southerners,  and 
the  Arab  view  of  Southerners  as  pagans  persisted. 

During  British  rule,  whatever  limited  accommodation  there  may 
have  been  between  Arabs  and  Africans  was  neither  widespread  nor 
deep  enough  to  counteract  a  longer  history  of  conflict  between  these 
peoples.  At  the  same  time,  for  their  own  reasons,  the  colonial  authori¬ 
ties  encouraged  segregation  of  the  ethnically  different  North  and 
South  (see  Britain’s  Southern  Policy,  eh.  1). 

However,  neither  Arab  attitudes  of  superiority  nor  British  domi¬ 
nance  in  the  South  led  to  loss  of  self-esteem  among  peoples  there.  A 
number  of  observers  remarked  that  most  Southern  peoples,  particu¬ 
larly  Nilotes,  such  as  the  Dinka,  Nuer,  and  Shilluk,  were  fiercely  proud 
and  refused  to  consider  their  religious  orientations  and  lifestyles  to  be 
inferior  to  those  of  the  country’s  dominant  elite. 

Other  tensions  within  Northern  Sudan  originated  not  from  tradi¬ 
tional  antipathies  but  from  competition  for  scarce  resources.  For 
example,  there  has  been  a  conflict  between  the  Rufaa  al-Haj,  a  group 
of  Arab  pastoralists  living  in  the  area  between  the  Blue  Nile  and  the 
White  Nile,  and  Fallata  (Fulani)  herders.  The  movements  of  the  Fal- 
lata  intersected  with  the  seasonal  migrations  of  the  Rufaa  al-Haj.  Here 
ethnic  differences  aggravated  but  did  not  cause  competition. 

The  general  reluctance  of  groups  in  the  South  to  accept  Muslim 
Arab  domination  likewise  did  not  imply  Southern  solidarity.  The 
opportunities  for  power  and  wealth  in  the  new  politics  and  bureau¬ 
cracy  in  South  Sudan  were  limited  in  the  early  2000s;  some  groups  felt 
deprived  of  their  shares  by  the  preeminent  Southern  group,  the  Dinka. 
Since  at  least  the  early  1970s,  one  of  the  main  sources  of  ethnic  con¬ 
flict  in  the  South  was  the  extent  to  which  the  Dinka  dominated  politics 
there  and  controlled  the  allocation  of  rewards,  whether  of  government 
posts  or  of  other  opportunities.  In  the  1955-56  census,  the  Dinka  con¬ 
stituted  a  little  more  than  40  percent  of  the  total  population  of  the  three 
provinces  that  at  that  time  constituted  the  South:  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  Aali 
an-Nil,  and  Al-Istiwai.  Because  no  other  group  approached  their  num¬ 
bers  as  Southern  independence  was  imminent,  the  Dinka  were 
expected  to  play  a  large  part  in  the  new  political  life  of  South  Sudan. 

Some  of  the  leading  figures  in  the  South,  such  as  Abel  Alier,  head  of 
the  South’s  regional  government  from  1972  until  1981,  are  Dinka,  as 
was  the  late  SPLA  leader  John  Garang  (although  the  SPLA  made  an 


95 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


effort  to  shed  its  Dinka  image  by  cultivating  supporters  in  other 
groups).  It  is  not  known  whether  the  25  Dinka  tribal  groups  are  equally 
represented  in  the  alleged  Dinka  predominance.  During  the  Anglo- 
Egyptian  Condominium,  the  colonial  power  deprived  other  groups, 
such  as  the  Nuer,  a  comparable  Nilotic  people  and  traditional  rivals  of 
the  Dinka,  of  leadership  opportunities  because  they  were  considered 
intractable,  were  then  not  numerous,  and  lived  in  inaccessible  areas. 
By  the  1990s,  however,  the  Nuer  had  begun  to  offer  themselves  as 
determined  rivals  to  the  Dinka.  It  is  these  kinds  of  ethnic  divisions  and 
tensions  within  and  among  different  peoples  in  Sudan  that  helped  fos¬ 
ter  civil  strife  and  that  hindered  national  unity  and  peace. 

Religious  Life 

Religion  in  Sudan,  as  in  many  developing  countries,  is  not  only  a 
matter  of  spirituality  and  rituals,  but  also  a  major  form  of  social  iden¬ 
tity.  In  the  2000s,  about  75  percent  of  Sudan’s  population  is  Muslim. 
Most  live  in  the  North  of  the  country,  where  they  constitute  more  than 
90  percent  of  the  population.  Data  on  Christians  are  less  reliable;  esti¬ 
mates  range  from  4  to  10  percent  of  the  population. 

Perhaps  20  percent  of  the  Sudanese  are  still  attached  to  the  indige¬ 
nous  religions  of  their  forebears.  Most  Christian  Sudanese  and  adher¬ 
ents  of  local  religious  systems  originated  in  the  South  but  by  the  early 
2000s  were  spread  throughout  all  regions.  Islam  has  made  inroads  into 
the  Southern  states  and  the  Nuba  Mountains;  many  estimates  hold  that 
its  adherents  are  roughly  equal  to  the  number  of  Christians  but  are  less 
visible  because  mission-educated  Christians  have  superior  education 
and  many  have  become  leaders  in  government  and  political  movements. 

Islam:  Tenets  and  Practice 

Sudanese  Muslims  are  adherents  of  the  Sunni  branch  of  Islam,  some¬ 
times  called  orthodox,  by  far  the  larger  of  the  two  major  branches,  the 
other  being  Shi’a  (see  Glossary),  which  is  not  represented  in  Sudan. 
Sunni  Islam  in  Sudan  is  not  marked  by  a  uniform  body  of  belief  or  prac¬ 
tice,  however.  Some  Muslims  oppose  aspects  of  Sunni  orthodoxy,  and 
rites  having  a  non-Islamic  origin  are  widespread,  accepted  as  if  they 
were  integral  to  Islam,  or  sometimes  recognized  as  separate.  Moreover, 
Sunni  Islam  in  Sudan  (as  in  much  of  Africa)  has  been  characterized  by 
the  formation  of  religious  orders  or  brotherhoods,  each  of  which  makes 
special  demands  on  its  adherents. 

Islam  requires  of  the  faithful  five  fundamental  obligations  that  con¬ 
stitute  the  Five  Pillars  of  Islam.  The  first  pillar,  the  shahada  or  profes¬ 
sion  of  faith,  is  the  affirmation  “There  is  no  god  but  God  (Allah)  and 


96 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Muhammad  is  his  prophet.”  It  is  the  first  step  in  becoming  a  Muslim 
and  a  significant  part  of  prayer.  The  second  obligation  is  prayer  at  five 
specified  times  of  the  day.  The  third  enjoins  almsgiving.  The  fourth 
requires  fasting  during  daylight  hours  in  the  month  of  Ramadan.  The 
fifth  requires  a  pilgrimage  to  Mecca  for  those  able  to  perform  it,  to  par¬ 
ticipate  in  the  special  rites  that  occur  during  the  twelfth  month  of  the 
lunar  calendar. 

Most  Sudanese  Muslims  who  are  bom  to  the  faith  meet  the  first 
requirement.  Conformity  to  the  second  requirement  is  more  variable. 
Many  males  in  the  cities  and  larger  towns  manage  to  pray  five  times  a 
day — at  dawn,  noon,  midaftemoon,  sundown,  and  evening.  Only  one 
or  two  of  these  prayer  times  occurs  during  the  usual  working  day  of  an 
urban  dweller.  A  cultivator  or  pastoralist  may  be  less  vigorous  in  meet¬ 
ing  these  requirements.  Regular  prayer  is  considered  the  mark  of  a  true 
Muslim;  it  is  usually  accomplished  individually  or  in  small  groups. 
Congregational  prayer  takes  place  at  the  mosque  on  Friday  when  Mus¬ 
lims  (usually  men,  but  occasionally  women  separately  located)  gather, 
not  only  for  the  noon  prayer,  but  also  to  hear  readings  and  a  sermon  by 
the  local  imam.  Muslims  fast  during  the  ninth  month  of  the  Muslim  cal¬ 
endar,  Ramadan,  the  time  during  which  the  first  revelations  to  Muham¬ 
mad  occurred.  It  is  a  period  during  which  most  Muslims  must  abstain 
from  eating,  drinking,  smoking,  and  sexual  activity  during  the  daylight 
hours.  The  well-to-do  perform  little  work  during  this  period,  and  many 
businesses  operate  on  reduced  schedules.  Because  the  months  of  the 
lunar  calendar  revolve  through  the  solar  year,  Ramadan  occurs  during 
the  various  seasons  over  a  period  of  about  33  years.  Observance 
appears  to  be  widespread,  especially  in  urban  areas  and  among  seden¬ 
tary  Sudanese  Muslims. 

Historically,  in  the  Muslim  world  almsgiving  meant  both  a  special 
tax  for  the  benefit  of  the  poor  and  voluntary  giving  to  the  needy,  but  its 
voluntary  aspect  alone  survives.  Alms  may  be  given  at  any  time,  but 
there  are  specific  occasions  in  the  Islamic  year  or  in  the  life  of  the  donor 
when  they  are  more  commonly  dispensed.  Gifts,  whether  of  money  or 
food,  may  be  made  on  such  occasions  as  the  feasts  that  end  Ramadan 
and  the  pilgrimage  to  Mecca,  or  in  penance  for  some  misdeed.  These 
offerings  and  others  are  typically  distributed  to  poor  kin  and  neighbors. 

Because  of  geographic  proximity,  the  pilgrimage  to  Mecca,  the  hajj, 
is  less  costly  and  arduous  for  the  Sudanese  than  it  is  for  many  Muslims. 
Nevertheless,  it  takes  time  (or  money  if  travel  is  by  air),  and  the  ordi¬ 
nary  Sudanese  Muslim  has  generally  found  it  difficult  to  accomplish, 
rarely  undertaking  it  before  middle  age.  Some  have  joined  pilgrimage 
societies  into  which  members  pay  a  small  amount  monthly  and  choose 
one  of  their  number  when  sufficient  funds  have  accumulated  to  send 


97 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


someone  on  the  pilgrimage.  A  returned  pilgrim  is  entitled  to  use  the 
honorific  title  al-hajj  for  a  man,  or  al-hajjah  for  a  woman. 

Another  ceremony  commonly  observed  is  the  great  feast  Id  al-Adha 
(also  known  as  Id  al-Kabir),  representing  the  sacrifice  made  during  the 
last  days  of  the  pilgrimage.  The  centerpiece  of  the  day  is  the  slaughter 
of  a  sheep,  which  is  distributed  to  the  poor,  kin,  neighbors,  and  friends, 
as  well  as  the  immediate  family. 

Islam  imposes  a  standard  of  encouraging  generosity,  fairness,  and 
honesty.  Sudanese  Arabs,  especially  those  who  are  wealthy,  are  expected 
by  their  coreligionists  to  be  generous. 

In  accordance  with  Islamic  law,  most  Sudanese  Muslims  do  not  eat 
pork  or  shellfish.  Conformity  to  the  prohibitions  on  gambling  and  alco¬ 
hol  is  less  widespread.  Usury  is  forbidden  by  Islamic  law,  but  Islamic 
banks  have  developed  other  ways  of  making  money  available  to  the 
public  (see  Islamic  Banking,  ch.  3). 

Historically,  Islam  insists  on  observance  of  sharia,  which  governs  not 
only  religious  activity  narrowly  conceived  but  also  daily  personal  and 
social  relationships.  In  principle,  sharia  stems  not  from  legislative 
enactment  or  judicial  decision  but  from  the  Quran  and  the  hadith — the 
accepted  sayings  of  Muhammad.  That  principle  has  given  rise  to  the 
conventional  understanding,  advocated  by  Islamists,  that  there  is  no  dis¬ 
tinction  between  the  religious  and  the  secular  in  a  truly  Islamic  society. 
Until  1983  modem  criminal  and  civil,  including  commercial,  law  gen¬ 
erally  prevailed  in  Sudan.  In  the  North,  however,  sharia  was  expected  to 
govern  what  is  usually  called  family  and  personal  law,  i.e.,  matters  such 
as  marriage,  divorce,  and  inheritance.  In  the  towns  and  in  some  seden¬ 
tary  communities,  sharia  was  accepted,  but  in  other  sedentary  commu¬ 
nities  and  among  nomads,  local  custom  was  likely  to  prevail — 
particularly  with  respect  to  inheritance  (see  The  Legal  System,  ch.  4). 

In  September  1983,  then-President  Ja’far  al-Numayri  (in  power 
1969-85)  imposed  sharia  throughout  the  land,  eliminating  the  civil  and 
penal  codes  by  which  the  country  had  been  governed  in  the  twentieth 
century.  His  government  brought  in  traditional  Islamic  punishments  for 
theft,  adultery,  homicide,  and  other  crimes.  To  demonstrate  its  “Islamic 
commitment”  vis-a-vis  the  large  number  of  Northern  Muslim  skeptics, 
the  al-Numayri  regime  went  out  of  its  way  to  implement  the  infamous 
hudud  (see  Glossary)  laws,  traditional  punishments  that  had  not  been 
employed  during  the  entire  previous  century  and  that  earned  the  regime 
much  criticism  in  the  foreign  media.  The  zealousness  with  which  these 
punishments  were  carried  out  contributed  to  the  fall  of  al-Numayri. 
Nevertheless,  no  successor  government,  including  that  of  Umar  Hassan 
Ahmad  al-Bashir,  has  shown  an  inclination  to  abandon  sharia,  although 
its  application  is  now  limited  to  majority-Muslim  states. 


98 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Islam  is  monotheistic,  and  Sunnis  insist  that  there  can  be  no  inter¬ 
cessors  between  an  individual  and  God.  Nevertheless,  folk  Islam  in 
Sudan  includes  a  belief  in  spirits  as  sources  of  illness  or  other  afflic¬ 
tions  and  in  magical  ways  of  dealing  with  them.  The  imam  of  a 
mosque  is  a  prayer  leader  and  preacher  of  sermons.  He  may  also  be  a 
teacher  and  in  smaller  communities  combines  both  functions.  In  the 
latter  role,  he  is  called  a  faqih  (jp\.,fuqaha ),  although  a  faqih  need  not 
be  an  imam.  In  addition  to  teaching  in  the  local  Quranic  school 
( khalwa ),  the  faqih  is  expected  to  write  texts  from  the  Quran  or  magi¬ 
cal  verses  to  be  used  as  amulets  and  cures.  His  blessing  may  be  asked 
at  births,  marriages,  deaths,  and  other  important  occasions,  and  he  may 
be  asked  to  participate  in  wholly  non-Islamic  harvest  rites  in  some 
remote  places.  All  of  these  functions  and  capacities  make  the  faqih  the 
most  important  figure  in  popular  Islam;  but  he  is  not  a  priest.  His  reli¬ 
gious  authority  is  based  on  his  putative  knowledge  of  the  Quran,  sha¬ 
ria,  and  techniques  for  dealing  with  occult  threats  to  health  and  well¬ 
being.  The  notion  that  the  words  of  the  Quran  will  protect  against  the 
actions  of  evil  spirits  or  the  evil  eye  is  deeply  embedded  in  popular 
Islam,  and  the  amulets  prepared  by  the  faqih  are  intended  to  protect 
their  wearers  against  these  dangers. 

In  Sudan  as  in  much  of  African  Islam,  the  cult  of  the  saint  is  of  con¬ 
siderable  importance,  although  some  Muslims  would  reject  it.  The 
development  of  the  cult  is  closely  related  to  the  presence  of  the  reli¬ 
gious  orders;  many  who  came  to  be  considered  saints  after  their  deaths 
were  founders  or  leaders  of  religious  orders  who  in  their  lifetimes 
were  thought  to  have  baraka ,  a  state  of  blessedness  implying  an  inner 
spiritual  power  inherent  in  the  religious  office.  Baraka  intensifies  after 
death  as  the  deceased  becomes  a  wali  (literally  custodial  guardian,  but 
in  this  context  translated  as  saint).  The  tomb  and  other  places  associ¬ 
ated  with  the  saintly  being  become  the  loci  of  the  person’s  baraka ,  and 
in  some  views  he  or  she  becomes  the  guardian  spirit  of  the  locality. 
The  intercession  of  the  wali  is  sought  on  a  variety  of  occasions,  partic¬ 
ularly  by  those  seeking  cures  or  by  barren  women  desiring  children.  A 
saint’s  annual  holy  day  is  the  occasion  of  a  local  festival,  which  may 
attract  a  large  gathering. 

Better-educated  Muslims  in  Sudan  often  disapprove  of  such  prac¬ 
tices;  some  may  participate  in  prayer  at  the  saint’s  tomb  but  argue  that 
prayer  is  directed  only  to  God.  Many  others,  however,  see  the  saint  not 
merely  as  an  intercessor  with,  and  an  agent  of,  God,  but  also  as  a 
nearly  autonomous  source  of  blessing  and  power,  thereby  approaching 
popular  as  opposed  to  orthodox  Islam.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Islamic  Movements  and  Religious  Orders 

Islam  made  its  deepest  and  longest-lasting  impact  in  Sudan  through 
the  activity  of  the  Islamic  religious  brotherhoods  or  orders.  These 
orders  emerged  in  the  Middle  East  in  the  twelfth  century  in  connection 
with  the  development  of  Sufism,  a  mystical  current  reacting  to  the 
strongly  legalistic  orientation  of  orthodox  Islam.  The  orders  first  came 
to  Sudan  in  the  sixteenth  century  and  became  significant  in  the  eigh¬ 
teenth.  Sufism  seeks  for  its  adherents  a  closer  personal  relationship 
with  God  through  special  spiritual  disciplines.  The  exercises  ( dhikr ) 
include  reciting  prayers  and  passages  of  the  Quran  and  repeating  the 
names,  or  attributes,  of  God  while  performing  physical  movements 
according  to  the  formula  established  by  the  founder  of  the  particular 
order.  Singing  and  dancing  may  be  introduced.  The  outcome  of  an 
exercise,  which  lasts  much  longer  than  the  usual  daily  prayer,  is  often  a 
state  of  ecstatic  abandon. 

A  mystical  or  devotional  way  (sing.,  tariqa;  pi.,  turuq)  is  the  basis 
for  the  formation  of  particular  orders,  each  of  which  is  also  called  a 
tariqa.  The  specialists  in  religious  law  and  learning  initially  looked 
askance  at  Sufism  and  the  Sufi  orders,  but  the  leaders  of  the  orders  in 
Sudan  have  won  acceptance  by  acknowledging  the  significance  of  the 
sharia  and  not  claiming  that  Sufism  replaces  it. 

The  principal  turuq  vary  considerably  in  their  practice  and  internal 
organization.  Some  orders  are  tightly  organized  in  hierarchical  fash¬ 
ion;  others  have  allowed  their  local  branches  considerable  autonomy. 
There  may  be  as  many  as  a  dozen  turuq  in  Sudan.  Some  are  restricted 
to  that  country;  others  are  widespread  in  Africa  or  the  Middle  East. 
Several  turuq,  for  all  practical  purposes  independent,  are  offshoots  of 
older  orders  and  were  established  by  men  who  altered  in  major  or 
minor  ways  the  tariqa  of  the  orders  to  which  they  had  formerly  been 
attached. 

The  oldest  and  most  widespread  of  the  turuq  is  the  Qadiriyyah 
founded  by  Abd  al-Qadir  al-Jilani  in  Baghdad  in  the  twelfth  century 
and  introduced  into  Sudan  in  the  sixteenth.  The  Qadiriyyah’s  principal 
rival  and  the  largest  tariqa  in  the  western  part  of  the  country  is  the 
Tijaniyyah,  a  sect  begun  by  Ahmad  al-Tijani  in  Morocco,  which  even¬ 
tually  penetrated  Sudan  in  about  1810  via  the  western  Sahel  (see  Glos¬ 
sary).  Many  Tijani  became  influential  in  Darfur,  and  other  adherents 
settled  in  northern  Kordofan.  A  class  of  Tijani  merchants  arose  later  on 
as  markets  grew  in  towns  and  trade  expanded,  making  them  less  con¬ 
cerned  with  providing  religious  leadership.  Of  greater  importance  to 
Sudan  was  the  tariqa  established  by  followers  of  Sayyid  Ahmad  ibn 
Idris,  known  as  al-Fasi,  who  died  in  1837.  Although  he  lived  in  Arabia 
and  never  visited  Sudan,  his  students  spread  into  the  Nile  valley,  estab-

lishing  indigenous  Sudanese  orders,  the  Majdhubiyyah,  the  Idrisiyyah, 
and  the  Khatmiyyah. 

Much  different  in  organization  from  the  other  brotherhoods  is  the 
Khatmiyyah  (or  Mirghaniyyah  after  the  name  of  the  order’s  founder). 
Established  in  the  early  nineteenth  century  by  Muhammad  Uthman  al- 
Mirghani,  it  became  the  best  organized  and  most  politically  oriented 
and  powerful  of  the  turuq  in  eastern  Sudan  (see  The  Turkiyya,  1821- 
85,  eh.  1).  Al-Mirghani  had  been  a  student  of  Sayyid  Ahmad  ibn  Idris 
and  had  joined  several  important  orders,  calling  his  own  order  the  Kha- 
tim  at-Turuq  (hence  Khatmiyyah,  meaning  the  seal  of  the  paths).  The 
salient  features  of  the  Khatmiyyah  are  the  extraordinary  status  of  the 
al-Mirghani  family,  whose  members  alone  may  head  the  order;  loyalty 
to  the  order,  which  guarantees  paradise;  and  the  centralized  control  of 
the  order’s  branches. 

The  Khatmiyyah  is  centered  in  Kassala  and  Al-Gedaref  States,  and 
its  greatest  following  is  in  eastern  Sudan  and  in  portions  of  the  riverine 
area.  The  al-Mirghani  family  was  able  to  turn  the  Khatmiyyah  into  a 
political  power  base,  despite  its  broad  geographical  distribution, 
because  of  the  tight  control  they  exercise  over  their  followers.  More¬ 
over,  gifts  from  followers  over  the  years  have  given  the  family  and  the 
order  the  wealth  to  organize  politically  and  eventually  led  to  the  for¬ 
mation  of  the  People’s  Democratic  Party  (PDP),  which  competed  in 
the  first  free  elections  for  parliament.  In  the  1960s,  the  PDP  helped 
form  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP),  which  some  50  years  later 
remained  the  second  largest  party  or  movement  in  the  country  (see 
Democratic  Unionist  Party,  ch.  4).  Khatmiyyah  members  tend  to  vote 


101

overwhelmingly  for  the  DUP,  much  as  Ansar  tend  to  vote  overwhelm¬ 
ingly  for  the  Umma  Party. 

Khatmiyyah  influence  does  not  equal,  however,  that  of  the  al-Mir- 
ghani  principal  rival,  known  as  Ansar,  or  followers  of  the  Madhi  (see 
Glossary).  Their  present-day  leader  is  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  the  great-grand¬ 
son  of  the  Mahdi,  Muhammad  Ahmad  ibn  al-Sayyid  Abdallah,  whose 
uprising  in  the  1880s  drove  the  Egyptian-Ottoman  Turk  administration 
from  Sudan  in  1885.  Most  other  orders  are  either  smaller  or  less  well 
organized  than  the  Khatmiyyah.  Moreover,  unlike  many  other  African 
Muslims,  Sudanese  Muslims  in  urban  areas  are  less  inclined  to  identify 
with  one  or  another  tariqa.  Instead  they  prefer  more  openly  political 
movements  that  seek  to  change  Islamic  society  and  governance  to  con¬ 
form  to  their  own  visions  of  the  true  nature  of  Islam. 

Mahdism  was  a  late  nineteenth-century  movement  in  origin.  It  has 
been  linked  to  a  religious  order,  but  it  is  not  a  tariqa  in  the  traditional 
sense.  Mahdism  and  its  adherents,  the  Ansar,  seek  the  regeneration  of 
Islam,  and  in  general,  are  critical  of  the  turuq.  Muhammad  Ahmad  ibn 
al-Sayyid  Abdallah,  a  faqih ,  proclaimed  himself  to  be  Al-Mahdi  al- 
Muntazar  (“the  awaited  guide  in  the  right  path,”  usually  seen  as  the 
Mahdi),  the  messenger  of  God  and  representative  of  the  Prophet 
Muhammad,  not  simply  a  charismatic  and  learned  teacher,  an  assertion 
that  became  an  article  of  faith  among  the  Ansar.  He  was  sent,  he  said, 
to  prepare  the  way  for  the  second  coming  of  the  Prophet  ‘Isa  (Jesus) 
and  the  impending  end  of  the  world.  In  anticipation  of  Judgment  Day, 
it  was  essential  that  the  people  return  to  a  simple  and  rigorous,  even 
puritanical,  Islam  (see  The  Mahdiyyah,  1885-98,  eh.  1). 

The  idea  of  the  coming  of  a  Mahdi  has  its  roots  in  Sunni  and  Shi’ a 
Islamic  traditions.  The  issue  for  Sudanese  and  other  Muslims  was 
whether  Muhammad  Ahmad  was  in  fact  the  Mahdi.  Indisputably,  how¬ 
ever,  Muhammad  Ahmad  managed  to  unify  the  majority  of  Sudan’s 
tribes  in  an  uprising  against  misrule  by  Egyptians  administering  the 
Turkiyyah.  His  movement  succeeded  in  ridding  the  country  of  foreign 
rule  in  1885,  and  in  that  respect  it  had  parallels  in  other  North  and  West 
African  sectarian  movements. 

In  the  century  since  the  Mahdist  uprising  and  into  the  2000s,  the 
neo-Mahdist  movement  and  the  Ansar,  supporters  of  Mahdism  from 
western  Sudan,  have  persisted  as  a  political  force  in  Sudan.  Many 
groups,  from  the  Baqqara  cattle  nomads  to  the  largely  sedentary  tribes 
on  the  White  Nile,  support  this  movement.  The  Ansar  are  hierarchi¬ 
cally  organized  under  the  control  of  Muhammad  Ahmad’s  successors, 
who  all  belonged  to  the  al-Mahdi  family  (members  of  the  ashraf).  The 
ambitions  and  varying  political  perspectives  of  different  members  of 
the  family  have  led  to  internal  conflicts,  and  it  appears  that  Sadiq  al-

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Mahdi,  president  of  the  Umma  Party  since  1964  and  putative  leader  of 
the  Ansar  since  the  early  1970s,  does  not  enjoy  the  unanimous  support 
of  all  Mahdists.  Mahdist  family  political  goals  and  ambitions  seem  to 
have  taken  precedence  over  the  movement’s  original  religious  mission. 
The  modern-day  Ansar  are  thus  loyal  more  to  the  political  descendants 
of  the  Mahdi  than  to  the  religious  message  of  Mahdism. 

By  the  1950s,  a  substantial  number  of  well-educated  middle-class 
urban  Muslims  began  to  feel  uncomfortable  with  the  tradition-bound 
and  rural-based  turuq.  Some  opted  for  the  Nile  Unity  Party  (NUP)  as 
an  alternative  political  organization,  which  gained  some  success  in 
the  early  elections  and  produced  the  country’s  first  prime  minister, 
Isma’il  al-Azhari.  Others  considered  the  NUP,  the  Umma,  and  other 
parties  to  be  too  factionalized  and  based  only  on  sectarian  and 
regional  support  rather  than  on  national  interests.  These  champions  of 
a  “New  Sudan”  were  drawn  from  the  urban  intelligentsia  and  divided 
fairly  evenly  in  the  1960s  between  the  far  left — two  communist  par¬ 
ties — and  the  far  right — the  Muslim  Brotherhood  (see  Glossary).  One 
of  the  Brotherhood’s  co-founders,  Hassan  Abdallah  al-Turabi,  con¬ 
tinued  to  play  a  national  role  in  the  early  2000s. 

Christianity 

Christianity  in  Sudan  can  be  divided  into  three  categories:  the 
numerically  small,  but  historically  oldest,  Orthodox  churches;  the 
numerically  large  “establishment”  churches;  and  the  numerically  small, 
but  fervently  supported,  foreign-based  evangelical  churches. 

Christianity  traveled  southward  up  the  Nile  in  the  fourth  century 
from  the  Holy  See  of  Alexandria,  and  its  Coptic  Orthodox  adherents 
can  be  found  in  small  numbers  in  the  urban  areas  of  Sudan  (and  in 
much  greater  numbers  in  neighboring  Egypt).  The  Greek  Orthodox 
community  is  equally  small  and  consists  of  Greek  and  Syrian  merchant 
families  who  established  businesses  in  the  Ottoman  period.  Both  Ortho¬ 
dox  communities  have  thriving  schools  and  social  clubs  in  Khartoum  as 
well  as  modem  church  buildings  in  the  capital.  Ethiopian  Orthodoxy  is 
found  among  Ethiopian  and  Eritrean  refugees  in  Khartoum  and  in  the 
border  region  near  Kassala. 

Christians  in  a  second  category  attend  what  British  colonialists  deemed 
mainstream  churches,  e.  g.,  Anglicans,  Presbyterians,  and  Roman  Catho¬ 
lics.  Under  the  colonial  system  known  as  indirect  administration,  British 
missionaries  were  allocated  what  was  then  Upper  Nile  region,  and  the 
Belgian  “White  Fathers”  Order,  Equatoria  Province,  now  Central  Equato- 
ria,  East  Equatoria,  and  West  Equatoria.  Church  buildings  had  to  be 
accompanied  by  a  school  and  small  health  facility.  In  this  fashion,  Chris¬ 
tian  missionaries  functioned  as  local  “extension  services”  for  the  district 


103

commissioners  and  were  seen  as  such.  These  missions  continued  to  oper¬ 
ate  intermittently  if  they  survived  the  ravages  of  two  civil  wars;  in  the 
early  2000s,  their  adherents  are  reasonably  well  assimilated.  Most  clergy 
in  these  areas  are  now  indigenous.  As  a  result  of  the  theological  division 
of  territory,  Catholics  are  found  along  the  borders  with  Uganda  and  the 
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  the  highest  concentration  being  clus¬ 
tered  around  Juba  and  Torit.  Thought  to  be  the  largest  Christian  denomi¬ 
nation,  they  numbered  4.6  million  in  2005  and  were  led  by  an  indigenous 
Dinka,  Cardinal  Gabriel  Zubayr. 

The  Christians  in  a  third  category  are  members  of  charismatic 
churches,  whose  founders  originally  had  been  allocated  the  geograph¬ 
ically  more  difficult  central-south  region,  meaning  former  Bahr  al- 
Ghazal  State.  They  depend  overwhelmingly  on  foreign-based  mis¬ 
sionary  organizations,  particularly  American  evangelicals,  who  have 
backed  them  financially  and  whose  supporters  in  Washington,  DC, 
have  been  among  the  most  adamant  critics  of  Khartoum  regimes. 
Their  churches  and  communities  have  been  the  most  exposed  to  the 
fighting  that  has  raged  in  the  South. 

The  Nilotic  peoples  were  originally  indifferent  to  Christianity, 
because  most  identified  it  with  the  conquering  colonial  powers,  per¬ 
ceiving  it  as  the  “white  man’s  religion.”  In  the  latter  half  of  the  twen¬ 
tieth  century,  however,  many  persons  in  the  educated  elite  embraced 
its  tenets,  at  least  superficially,  as  Christianity  and  English  became 
symbols  of  opposition  to  Khartoum  and/or  Muslim  domination. 

The  treatment  of  Christians  in  Sudan  after  the  introduction  of  sha¬ 
ria  law  in  September  1983  was  quite  controversial.  Most  observers 
agree  that  then-President  Ja’far  al-Numayri  instituted  these  laws  to 
shore  up  his  faltering  regime  in  the  face  of  ever-spreading  disaffec¬ 
tion  among  Muslim  Northerners  and  at  a  time — April  1983 — when 
the  previously  more-quiescent  Southerners  were  partly  engaged  in  a 
new  rebellion.  His  increasingly  insecure  regime  tried  to  prove  its 
Islamist  credentials  by  harsh  application  of  the  new  hudud  laws  in 
the  capital  region,  especially  regarding  alcohol  consumption  and 
petty  thievery. 

This  step  coincided  with  the  arrival  of  large  numbers  of  bewildered 
refugees  from  the  South,  who  had  fled  to  the  capital  area  with  the  recent 
outbreak  of  war.  They  were  unfamiliar  not  only  with  their  new  residen¬ 
tial  surroundings  but  also  with  the  new  laws.  This  resulted  in  hudud 
applications  falling  disproportionately  on  unsuspecting  Southern  refu¬ 
gees  or  unskilled  workers,  many  of  whom  had  been  used  to  the  easy 
availability  of  alcoholic  drink  on  their  day  off  on  Sunday.  Not  surpris¬ 
ingly,  news  of  Southerners  being  victimized  at  the  hands  of  the 
“Islamic”  and  “Arab”  government  spread  internally  as  well  as  intema-

tionally  and  exacerbated  existing  tensions.  These  reports  were  subse¬ 
quently  cited  as  alleged  evidence  of  discrimination  against  non- 
Muslims,  and  they  were  later  combined  with  further  allegations  of 
deliberate  government  policies  to  “Islamize”  Christians  from  the  South. 

In  reality,  Christians  of  many  denominations  practice  their  religion 
freely  in  Sudan.  As  of  20 1 1 ,  they  were  found  not  only  in  the  South, 
but  also  more  than  2  million  were  spread  throughout  the  cities  of  the 
North.  They  have  access  to  churches  ranging  from  small  and  primi¬ 
tive  buildings  to  large  and  majestic  cathedrals,  such  as  those  in  Khar¬ 
toum  and  Wau,  although  churches  are  not  necessarily  within  easy 
commuting  distance.  Christian  activities  include  small  Pentecostal 
churches  on  the  edge  of  urban  areas,  established  seminaries  in  Khar¬ 
toum  North,  and  open-air  services  attended  by  thousands  of  worship¬ 
pers  in  downtown  Khartoum. 

Catholic,  Protestant,  and  Orthodox  denominations  are  all  members 
of  the  Sudan  Council  of  Churches  (SCC),  a  countrywide  organization 
for  the  protection  and  promotion  of  their  common  interests.  A  sub¬ 
group,  the  New  Sudan  Council  of  Churches,  was  established  when 
war  made  it  logistically  difficult  for  Southerners  to  participate  in  SCC 
affairs.  A  larger  umbrella  group,  the  Sudan  Inter-Religious  Council,  is 
an  outgrowth  of  the  peace  accords  of  2005.  Intended  to  foster  dialogue 


105 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


and  reconciliation  between  Christian  and  Muslim  communities,  the 
council  sponsored  a  conference  on  the  role  of  religious  leaders  in 
peacemaking  in  July  2005,  among  other  initiatives. 

The  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  of  January  2005  decreed 
that  each  state  determines  the  nature  of  its  laws  by  majority  vote,  a 
reaffirmation  of  de  facto  national  policy  since  at  least  the  mid-1990s. 
Sharia  remains  in  force  in  the  15  provinces  of  the  North,  but  non- 
Muslims  in  Khartoum  are  exempt  from  punishments  prescribed  by 
sharia  and  enjoy  other  religious  protections.  Christians  and  tradition¬ 
alists  in  the  10  states  of  the  South  enjoy  unrestricted  religious  free¬ 
dom  without  regard  for  Islamic  laws  and  regulations. 

Indigenous  African  Religions 

Among  Southerners,  each  indigenous  religion  is  unique  to  a  spe¬ 
cific  ethnic  group,  although  several  groups  may  share  elements  of 
belief  and  ritual  because  of  common  ancestry  or  mutual  influence. 
The  group  serves  as  the  congregation,  and  an  individual  usually 
belongs  to  that  faith  by  virtue  of  membership  in  the  group.  Believing 
and  acting  in  a  religious  mode  is  part  of  daily  life  and  is  linked  to  the 
social,  political,  and  economic  actions  and  relationships  of  the 
group.  The  beliefs  and  practices  of  indigenous  African  religions  in 
Sudan  are  not  systematized,  in  that  people  do  not  generally  attempt 
to  put  together  in  coherent  fashion  the  doctrines  they  hold  and  the 
rituals  they  practice. 

The  concept  of  a  high  spirit  or  divinity,  usually  seen  as  a  creator 
and  sometimes  ultimately  responsible  for  the  actions  of  lesser  spirits, 
is  common  to  most  groups  in  the  South.  Often  the  higher  divinity  is 
remote,  and  believers  treat  the  other  spirits  as  autonomous,  orienting 
their  rituals  to  these  spirits  rather  than  to  the  high  god.  Such  spirits 
may  be  perceived  as  forces  of  nature  or  as  manifestations  of  ances¬ 
tors.  Spirits  may  intervene  in  people’s  lives,  either  because  individu¬ 
als  or  groups  have  transgressed  the  norms  of  the  society  or  have 
failed  to  pay  adequate  attention  to  the  ritual  that  should  be  generally 
addressed  to  the  spirits. 

The  Nilotes  generally  acknowledge  an  active  supreme  deity,  who 
is  therefore  the  object  of  ritual,  but  the  belief  and  rituals  differ  from 
group  to  group.  The  Nuer,  for  example,  have  no  word  corresponding 
solely  and  exclusively  to  God.  The  word  sometimes  so  translated 
refers  not  only  to  the  universal  governing  spirit  but  also  to  ancestors 
and  forces  of  nature  whose  spirits  are  considered  aspects  of  God.  It  is 
possible  to  pray  to  one  spirit  as  distinct  from  another  but  not  as  dis¬ 
tinct  from  God.  Often  the  highest  manifestation  of  spirit,  God,  is 
prayed  to  directly.  God  is  particularly  associated  with  the  winds,  the 


106 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


sky,  and  birds,  but  these  are  not  worshipped.  The  Dinka  attribute  any 
remarkable  occurrence  to  the  direct  influence  of  God  and  will  some¬ 
times  mark  the  occasion  with  an  appropriate  ritual.  Aspects  of  God 
(the  universal  spirit)  are  distinguished,  chief  of  which  is  deng  (rain). 
For  the  Nuer,  the  Dinka,  and  other  Nilotes,  human  beings  are  as  ants 
to  God,  whose  actions  are  not  to  be  questioned  and  who  is  regarded 
as  the  judge  of  all  human  behavior. 

Cattle  play  a  significant  role  in  Nilotic  rituals.  Cattle  are  sacrificed 
to  God  as  expiatory  substitutes  for  their  owners.  The  function  is  con¬ 
sistent  with  the  significance  of  cattle  in  all  aspects  of  Nilotic  life. 
Among  the  Nuer,  for  example,  and  with  some  variations  among  the 
Dinka,  cattle  are  the  foundation  of  family  and  community  life,  essen¬ 
tial  to  subsistence,  marriage  payments,  and  personal  pride.  The  cattle 
shed  is  a  shrine  and  meeting  place,  the  center  of  the  household;  a  man 
of  substance,  head  of  the  family,  and  a  leading  figure  in  the  commu¬ 
nity  is  called  a  “bull.”  Every  man  and  the  spirits  themselves  have  ox 
names  that  denote  their  characteristic  qualities.  These  beliefs  and 
institutions  give  meaning  to  the  symbolism  of  rubbing  ashes  on  a  sac¬ 
rificial  cow’s  back  in  order  to  transfer  the  burden  of  the  owner’s  sins 
to  the  animal. 

The  universal  god  of  the  Shilluk  is  more  remote  than  that  of  the 
Nuer  and  Dinka  and  is  addressed  through  the  founder  of  the  Shilluk 
royal  clan.  Nyiking,  considered  both  man  and  god,  is  not  clearly  dis¬ 
tinguished  from  the  supreme  deity  in  ritual,  although  the  Shilluk  may 
make  the  distinction  in  discussing  their  beliefs.  The  king  ( reth )  of  the 
Shilluk  is  regarded  as  divine,  an  idea  that  has  never  been  accepted  by 
the  Nuer  and  Dinka. 

All  of  the  Nilotes,  and  other  peoples  as  well,  pay  attention  to  ances¬ 
tral  spirits,  the  nature  of  the  cult  varying  considerably  as  to  the  kinds  of 
ancestors  who  are  thought  to  have  power  in  the  lives  of  their  descen¬ 
dants.  Sometimes,  it  may  be  the  founding  ancestors  of  the  group  whose 
spirits  are  potent.  In  many  cases,  it  is  the  recently  deceased  ancestors 
who  are  active  and  must  be  placated. 

There  is  a  wide  range  of  natural  forces  thought  to  be  activated  by 
spirits,  of  which  perhaps  the  most  common  is  rain.  Although  South¬ 
ern  Sudan  does  not  suffer  as  acutely  as  the  North  from  lack  of  rain, 
there  has  sometimes  been  a  shortage,  particularly  from  the  1970s  to 
1990;  this  shortage  has  created  or  exacerbated  hardship,  famine,  and 
the  travail  of  civil  war.  For  this  reason,  rituals  connected  with  rain 
have  become  important  in  many  ethnic  groups,  and  ritual  specialists 
concerned  with  rain  or  thought  to  incarnate  the  spirit  of  rain  are 
important  figures. 


107 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  distinction  between  the  natural  and  the  supernatural  that  has 
emerged  in  the  Western  world  is  not  relevant  to  traditional  religions. 
Spirits  may  have  much  greater  power  than  human  beings,  but  their 
powers  are  perceived  not  as  altering  the  way  the  world  commonly 
works  but  rather  as  explaining  occurrences  in  nature  or  in  the  social 
world. 

Some  men  and  women  are  also  thought  to  have  extraordinary  pow¬ 
ers.  How  these  powers  are  believed  to  have  been  acquired  and  exer¬ 
cised  varies  from  group  to  group.  In  general,  however,  some  people 
are  thought  to  have  inherited  the  capacity  to  harm  others  and  to  have  a 
disposition  to  do  so.  Typically,  they  are  accused  of  inflicting  illness  on 
specific  individuals,  frequently  their  neighbors  or  kin.  In  some  groups, 
it  is  thought  that  men  and  women  who  have  no  inherent  power  to  harm 
may  nevertheless  do  damage  to  others  by  manipulating  images  of  the 
victim  or  items  closely  associated  with  that  person. 

An  individual  may  occasionally  be  thought  of  as  a  sorcerer.  When 
illness  or  some  other  affliction  strikes  in  a  form  that  is  generally 
attributed  to  a  sorcerer,  there  are  ways  (typically  some  form  of  divina¬ 
tion)  of  confirming  that  witchcraft  was  used  and  of  identifying  the 
sorcerer. 

The  notions  of  sorcery  are  not  limited  to  the  South  but  are  found  in 
varying  fonns  among  peoples,  including  nomads  and  other  Arabs,  who 
consider  themselves  Muslims.  A  specific  belief  widespread  among 
Arabs  and  other  Muslim  peoples  is  the  notion  of  the  evil  eye.  Although 
a  physiological  peculiarity  of  the  eye  (walleye  or  cross-eye)  may  be 
considered  indicative  of  the  evil  eye,  any  persons  expressing  undue 
interest  in  the  private  concerns  of  another  may  be  suspected  of  inflicting 
deliberate  harm  by  a  glance.  Unlike  most  witchcraft,  where  the  perpe¬ 
trator  is  known  by  and  often  close  to  the  victim,  the  evil  eye  is  usually 
attributed  to  strangers.  Children  are  thought  to  be  the  most  vulnerable. 

Ways  exist  to  protect  oneself  against  sorcery  or  the  evil  eye.  Many 
magico-religious  specialists — diviners  and  sorcerers — deal  with 
these  matters  in  Sudanese  societies.  The  diviner  is  able  to  determine 
whether  witchcraft  or  sorcery  is  responsible  for  the  affliction  and  to 
discover  the  source.  He  also  protects  and  cures  by  providing  amulets 
and  other  protective  devices  for  a  fee  or  by  helping  a  victim  punish 
(in  occult  fashion)  the  sorcerer  in  order  to  be  cured  of  the  affliction.  If 
it  is  thought  that  an  evil  spirit  has  possessed  a  person,  an  exorcist  may 
be  called  in.  In  some  groups,  these  tasks  may  be  accomplished  by  one 
person;  in  others,  the  degree  of  specialization  may  be  greater.  In  the 
North,  among  Muslim  peoples,  the  faqih  may  spend  more  of  his  time 
as  diviner,  dispenser  of  amulets,  healer,  and  exorcist  than  as  Quranic 
teacher,  imam  of  a  mosque,  or  mystic.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Social  Order 

The  social  order  in  Sudan  was  very  much  in  flux  in  the  2000s.  Var¬ 
ious  factors,  including  rural  to  urban  migration;  the  large  numbers  of 
displaced  persons — foreign  and  native — in  so  many  parts  of  the  coun¬ 
try,  many  of  whom  were  starting  to  return  to  their  homes  after  the  end 
of  the  civil  war;  economic  pressures  forcing  more  and  more  women 
into  the  labor  force;  plus  the  increased  availability  of  modem  technol¬ 
ogy  (e.g.,  cellular  telephones,  television  stations,  and  the  growing 
availability  of  the  Internet  to  at  least  professional  elites  in  urban  set¬ 
tings),  have  all  combined  to  create  new  social  patterns  that  were  still 
evolving. 

The  “old”  Sudan,  where  religious,  tribal,  and  village  notables  held 
sway  in  an  unchallenged  fashion,  so  prevalent  for  most  of  the  twentieth 
century  and  before,  still  existed  but  no  longer  dominated  the  country’s 
social  order.  Parallel  to  it  were  fragmented  societies  in  large  urban  set¬ 
tings,  smaller  kinship  communities  in  the  poorer  outskirts  ringing  the 
large  centers,  and  the  extensive  dwelling  areas  of  displaced  persons 
who  were  at  least  temporarily  cut  off  from  their  traditional  leaders. 
Young  men  and  women  more  often  than  not  had  to  fend  for  them¬ 
selves,  whether  they  were,  for  example,  Northern  Muslim  university 
graduates  or  Southern  migrant  women  selling  beer,  or  perhaps  them¬ 
selves,  in  order  to  make  ends  meet.  In  addition,  it  was  alleged — 
although  such  a  factor  was  probably  exaggerated — that  most  Sudanese 
had  relatives  living  abroad  who  sent  not  only  some  financial  support 
but  also  accompanying  ideas  about  other  ways  of  living,  worshipping, 
and  identifying.  While  such  influences  were  common  for  North  Afri¬ 
cans  who  lived  close  to  Europe,  or  Lebanese  and  Palestinians  working 
in  Gulf  countries  or  overseas,  they  were  relatively  new  to  Sudan. 

Many  outside  observers  have  noted  over  the  years  how  strongly 
anchored  Sudanese  customs  and  values  have  been.  Historically,  poor 
Sudanese  found  economic  and  personal  support  with  their  kinfolk, 
and  it  was  not  uncommon  for  a  man  fallen  on  hard  times  to  stay  at  a 
relative’s  home  for  months  at  a  time,  certain  in  the  knowledge  that 
he  would  be  cared  for  and  not  asked  for  anything  in  return.  In  the 
new  century,  this  pattern  has  become  the  exception  rather  than  the 
rule.  If  there  is  no  future  at  home,  the  preferred  option  is  to  join  rela¬ 
tives  abroad,  for  those  who  can  devise  the  means  to  do  so. 

How,  then,  can  one  present  the  “new”  social  order  in  the  early 
2000s?  At  least  five  separate  lifestyles  can  be  observed:  that  found  in 
the  core  of  the  major  cities,  that  of  the  exurbs  surrounding  them,  set¬ 
tled  village  folk  in  the  rural  areas,  seminomads,  and  genuine  pasto- 
ralists.  The  last  two  categories  are  distinguished  by  the  fact  that 
seminomads  have  a  defined  home  base  inhabited  year-round  by  the 


109 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


old,  the  very  young,  and  the  infirm,  but  from  which  the  rest  of  the 
tribe  moves  out  for  six  to  nine  months  at  a  time  and  then  returns. 
Genuine  pastoralists,  who  are  very  few  in  number,  have  no  fixed 
specific  address  but  roam  in  generalized  areas  that  are  commonly 
recognized  by  friend  and  foe. 

Northern  Society 

The  paramount  chief  remains  a  venerated  figure  for  tribally  orga¬ 
nized  Sudanese,  one  who  still  dispenses  judgments  regarding  per¬ 
sonal  conduct,  answers  local  administrative  questions,  and  sometimes 
even  comments  on  marriage.  Among  Arabs  and  Arabized  Northern¬ 
ers,  he  is  known  as  the  nazir.  Below  him  is  the  subtribal  chief  usually 
referred  to  as  sheikh  (although  that  term  has  multiple  meanings). 
Most  people  in  the  South  also  recognize  paramount  chiefs  for  large 
tribes,  but  their  honorific  names  vary  locally. 

In  rural  villages  and  even  in  some  near  the  edges  of  large  cities,  the 
administrative  head  is  referred  to  as  omda.  His  role  as  village  head¬ 
man  parallels  in  many  ways  that  of  the  patriarch  of  an  extended  fam¬ 
ily  and,  in  large  villages,  that  of  the  sheikh  heading  the  hara ,  or 
quarter.  Omda  rule  by  consensus,  rather  than  by  dictate,  take  responsi¬ 
bility  for  knowing  every  person  living  in  their  area,  and  are  always 
approachable  by  one  and  all.  They,  not  the  police,  adjudicate  disputes. 
They  mediate  between  families,  and  they  offer  advice  on  education, 
work  opportunities,  and  marriage  issues.  Their  source  of  authority  is 
always  customary  law,  although  some  central  governments  validate 
their  positions  officially,  as  did  the  British-led  colonial  administration 
and  the  early  postindependence  regimes,  which  preferred  to  adminis¬ 
ter  local  government  through  such  traditional  leaders.  They  should 
not,  however,  be  seen  as  autocrats,  because  their  position  depends  on 
acceptance  by  the  community  and  they  are  required  to  consult  regu¬ 
larly  with  all  parties,  most  especially  with  local  “wise  men”  with 
whom  they  are  likely  to  be  in  daily  contact. 

Parallel  to  these  territorial  communities  are  the  religious  associa¬ 
tions  (see  Religious  Life,  this  eh.).  In  settled  rural  areas,  the  faqih 
might  have  similar  authority  to  the  omda  or  sheikh,  except  that  his 
domain  is  typically  limited  to  spiritual  and  mystical  areas;  he  would 
not  be  consulted  on  matters  of  local  government. 

The  closer  one  approaches  to  the  cities  through  the  more  rural  out¬ 
skirts — and  in  the  case  of  the  capital  region  through  impoverished 
refugee  camps — the  central  and  widely  accepted  authority  figure  is 
absent.  There  are,  of  course,  some  local  leaders,  but  their  authority 
does  not  compare  with  that  of  the  sheikh  or  nazir.  If  local  disputes 
arise  and  they  cannot  be  resolved  quickly  by  government  authorities, 


110 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


who  in  any  case  would  have  less  legitimacy  than  the  traditional  lead¬ 
ers  in  the  eyes  of  the  local  populace,  the  dispute  might  simply  fester 
for  long  periods,  or  the  offended  party  might  move  away  to  another 
ex-urban  location.  Newcomers  to  urban  centers  have  shallow  roots  by 
definition  and  feel  less  pressured  to  conform  to  local  norms,  to  which 
they  have  no  allegiance  in  this  extremely  heterogeneous  society. 

Aside  from  the  presence  of  government  buildings,  core  urban  areas 
tend  to  be  more  stable  because  of  their  location  and  longevity.  Estab¬ 
lished  neighborhoods  used  to  be  “overseen”  by  a  sheikh,  but  in  recent 
years  the  civil  servants,  businessmen,  educators,  laborers,  entertainers, 
and  other  professional  people  are  consumed  by  the  typical  urban  preoc¬ 
cupations  of  seemingly  never-ending  rush-hour  traffic,  shopping,  and 
visiting  relatives  in  typically  large  extended  families  no  longer  living 
side-by-side  as  in  rural  areas  or  days  of  yore.  The  introduction  of  mini¬ 
buses,  cellular  phones,  extended  Sudanese  television  transmission,  plus 
the  availability  for  the  middle  and  upper  classes  of  satellite  TV  and  the 
Internet,  has  visibly  shifted  the  focus  of  daily  activities  from  extended  to 
nuclear  families.  For  sure,  in  times  of  stress,  relatives  come  together  in 
solidarity  vis-a-vis  the  world,  but  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  life  in  the  large 
cities  of  Sudan  resembles  more  and  more  that  of  midsize  cities  in  the 
West.  Consequently,  the  “big  men”  so  easily  identifiable  in  rural  areas 
are  not  found  in  large  cities.  If  anything,  they  are  being  replaced  by  well- 
known  singers,  famous  poets,  and  the  occasional  entertainer.  Business¬ 
men  and  top  professionals  in  medicine,  law,  and  information  technology 
are  all  concentrated  in  the  capital  region  and,  together  with  senior  offi¬ 
cials  in  the  national  government,  have  fonned  a  new  class  in  which 
everyone  seems  to  know  almost  everyone  else.  Together  they  form  what 
some  refer  to  as  the  “political  state”  or  the  “ruling  class.” 

Southern  Communities 

South  Sudan,  by  contrast,  evolved  somewhat  differently,  in  part 
because  of  its  different  demography,  but  also  because  the  colonial 
administration  had  created  a  Closed  Districts  Ordinance  to  protect  the 
region  from  both  commercial  and  cultural  influences  from  the  North. 
In  preindependence  Sudan,  most  communities  in  the  South  were 
small,  except  for  the  large  conglomerate  of  Nilotes,  Dinka,  and  Nuer 
who  dominated  what  were  then  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  Upper  Nile  Prov¬ 
inces  and  the  Azande  people  of  former  Equatoria  Province.  During 
the  Condominium,  the  colonial  administration  imposed  stronger  local 
authority  on  communities  in  the  South.  It  made  local  leaders  into 
chiefs  or  headmen  and  gave  them  executive  and  judicial  powers — 
tempered  by  local  councils,  usually  elders — to  administer  their  peo¬ 
ple,  under  the  scrutiny  of  a  British  district  commissioner.  As  in  the 


111 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


North,  the  relatively  fluid  relationships  and  boundaries  among  South¬ 
erners  became  better  defined  and  more  stabilized. 

There  is  scant  systematic  evidence  of  how  independence,  civil  war, 
and  famine  affected  the  social  order  of  the  peoples  of  the  South.  The 
gradual  incorporation  of  Southerners  into  the  national  system — if 
only  as  migrant  laborers  and  as  local  craftsmen — and  increased 
opportunities  for  education  did,  however,  affect  social  arrangements, 
ideas  of  status,  and  political  views. 

An  educated  elite  emerged  in  the  South  after  independence,  and  by 
the  early  2000s,  some  members  of  this  elite  were  important  politicians 
and  administrators  at  the  regional  and  national  levels.  Other  members, 
however,  had  emigrated  to  escape  Northern  discrimination.  How  the 
newer  elite  was  linked  to  the  older  traditional  one  was  not  clear.  Secu¬ 
lar  chieftainships  had  been  mostly  gifts  of  the  colonial  authorities,  but 
the  sons  of  chiefs  took  advantage  of  their  positions  to  get  a  Western 
education  and  to  create  family  ties  among  local  and  regional  elites. 

South  Sudan’s  development  of  an  elite  class  based  on  education 
and  government  position  came  about  in  part  because  of  the  absence  of 
an  indigenous  trading  and  entrepreneurial  class,  which  might  have 
challenged  the  educated  elite.  Merchants  there  were  mostly  Arabs  or 
others  originating  elsewhere,  especially  Greeks.  In  addition,  the  South 
lacked  the  equivalent  of  the  Muslim  leaders  of  religious  orders  in  the 
North,  who  also  might  have  claimed  a  share  of  influence.  Instead  of 
several  elites  owing  their  status  and  power  to  varied  sources  and  con¬ 
stituencies,  the  South  developed  an  elite  that  looked  for  its  support  to 
persons  of  the  same  ethnic  background  and  to  those  who  identified 
with  the  South’s  African  heritage. 

Clans  were  of  two  kinds  in  traditional  Nilotic  society.  One  kind,  a 
minority  but  a  large  one,  consisted  of  clans  whose  members  had  reli¬ 
gious  functions  and  furnished  the  priests  of  subtribes  and  sometimes 
of  tribes.  These  priests  have  been  called  chiefs  or  masters  of  the  fish¬ 
ing  spear,  a  reference  to  the  ritual  importance  of  that  instrument.  Clans 
of  the  other  kind  were  warrior  groupings.  The  difference  was  one  of 
function  rather  than  rank.  A  spear  master  prayed  for  his  people  when 
they  went  to  war,  or  in  other  difficult  situations,  and  mediated  between 
quarreling  groups.  He  could  function  as  a  leader,  but  his  powers  lay  in 
persuasion,  not  coercion.  A  spear  master  with  a  considerable  reputa¬ 
tion  for  spiritual  power  was  deferred  to  on  many  issues.  In  rare 
cases — the  most  important  being  that  of  the  Shilluk — one  of  the  ritual 
offices  gained  influence  over  an  entire  people,  and  its  holder  was 
assigned  the  attributes  of  a  divine  king. 

A  special  religious  figure — commonly  called  a  prophet — has  arisen 
among  some  of  the  Nilotic  peoples  from  time  to  time.  Such  prophets, 


112 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


thought  to  be  possessed  by  a  sky  spirit,  often  had  much  wider  influ¬ 
ence  than  the  ritual  officeholders,  who  were  confined  to  specific  terri¬ 
torial  clan  or  lineage  segments.  They  gained  substantial  reputations  as 
healers  and  used  those  reputations  to  rally  their  peoples  against  other 
ethnic  groups  and  sometimes  against  “the  Arabs”  and  the  Europeans. 
The  Condominium  authorities  considered  prophets  subversive,  even 
when  their  message  did  not  apparently  oppose  authority,  and  hence 
suppressed  them. 

Another  social  pattern  common  to  the  Nilotes  was  the  age-set  sys¬ 
tem.  Traditionally,  males  were  periodically  initiated  into  sets  according 
to  age;  with  the  set,  they  moved  through  a  series  of  stages,  assuming  and 
shedding  rights  and  responsibilities  as  the  group  advanced  in  age.  The 
system  was  closely  linked  to  warfare  and  raiding,  which  diminished 
during  the  Condominium.  In  postindependence  times,  civil  war  and 
famine  further  undermined  the  system,  and  its  remnants  seemed  likely 
to  fade  as  formal  education  becomes  more  accessible. 

The  Dinka  were  the  most-populous  Nilotic  people  historically,  so 
numerous  that  social  and  political  patterns  varied  from  one  tribal 
group  to  another.  Among  the  Dinka,  the  tribal  group  was  composed  of 
a  set  of  independent  tribes  that  settled  in  a  continuous  area.  The  tribe, 
which  ranged  in  size  from  1,000  to  25,000  persons,  traditionally  had 
only  two  political  functions.  First,  it  controlled  and  defended  the  dry- 
season  pastures  of  its  constituent  subtribes;  second,  if  a  member  of  the 
tribe  killed  another  member,  the  issue  would  be  resolved  peacefully. 
Homicide  committed  by  someone  outside  the  tribe  was  avenged,  but 
not  by  the  tribe  as  a  whole.  The  colonial  administration,  seeking  equi¬ 
table  access  to  adequate  pasturage  for  all  tribes,  introduced  a  different 
system  and  thus  eliminated  one  of  the  tribe’s  two  responsibilities.  In 
postindependence  Sudan,  the  handling  of  homicide  as  a  crime  against 
the  state  made  the  tribe’s  second  function  also  irrelevant.  The  utiliza¬ 
tion  and  politicization  of  ethnic  groups  as  units  of  local  government 
have  supported  the  continuation  of  tribal  structures  into  the  present; 
however,  tribal  chiefs  in  the  early  2000s  did  not  fulfill  any  traditional 
functions  except  as  sage  advisers  to  their  people  in  personal  and  fam¬ 
ily  matters. 

Some  attempts  were  made  to  transform  these  ethnic  tribal  structures 
in  order  to  produce  a  national,  or  at  least  a  greater  subnational,  identity. 
For  instance,  in  the  early  formation  of  the  Sudan  People’s  Fiberation 
Movement  (SPFM),  one  of  the  main  ideological  goals  was  to  produce  a 
new  non-Northem,  riverine-area  solidarity  based  on  the  mobilization  of 
diverse  ethnic  groups  in  deprived  areas  (see  Sudan  People’s  Fiberation 
Movement,  eh.  4;  Sudan  People’s  Fiberation  Movement/ Army,  ch.  5). 
To  achieve  this  new  sense  of  solidarity,  it  attempted  to  recruit  not  just 


113 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


peoples  in  the  South  but  also  the  Fur,  Funj,  Nuba,  and  Beja  communi¬ 
ties.  Its  success  was  limited  by  the  persistent  perception  that  the  SPLM 
was  essentially  Dinka-based.  Further,  non-Dinka  Southerners  were  sus¬ 
picious  of  the  leadership’s  motives,  even  though  many,  like  the  above- 
mentioned  four  communities  based  in  the  North,  agreed  on  the  princi¬ 
ple  of  resisting  perceived  Arab  domination.  Examples  of  splits  within 
the  rebel  movement  in  the  South  were  the  establishment  of  the  South 
Sudan  Independence  Movement  (SSIM)  and  the  South  Sudan  Unity 
Movement  (SSUM),  which  resulted  from  other  tribal  and  clan  identi¬ 
ties  following  a  proposed  peace  agreement  in  1997. 

The  subtribes  were  the  largest  significant  political  segments  histor¬ 
ically,  and  they  were  converted  into  subchiefdoms  by  the  colonial 
government.  Although  the  subchiefs  were  stripped  of  most  of  their 
administrative  authority  during  the  al-Numayri  regime  (1969-85)  and 
replaced  by  loyal  members  of  the  Sudan  Socialist  Union,  the  advice 
of  subchiefs  continued  to  be  sought  on  local  matters.  Thus,  a  three¬ 
tiered  system  was  created:  the  traditional  authorities,  the  Sudanese 
civil  service,  and  the  political  bureaucrats  from  Khartoum.  During  the 
1980s,  this  confused  system  of  administration  dissolved  into  virtual 
anarchy  as  a  result  of  the  replacement  of  one  regime  by  another,  civil 
war,  and  famine.  In  the  South,  however,  during  the  next  two  decades, 
the  SPLM  created  new  local  administrative  structures  in  areas  under 
its  control.  Even  so,  in  general  the  traditional  structure  of  Nilotic  soci¬ 
ety,  although  severely  damaged,  remained  relatively  unchanged.  Loy¬ 
alties  to  one’s  rural  ethnic  community  were  deeply  rooted  and  were 
not  forgotten,  even  by  those  who  fled  for  refuge  or  employment  to 
urban  centers  in  the  North. 

Urban  and  National  Elites 

Sudan  in  the  early  2000s  did  not  yet  have  an  urban  national  elite 
comparable  to  those  of  Egypt,  Lebanon,  Morocco,  or  Syria  in  the 
Arab  world,  or  to  Ethiopia,  Kenya,  and  Nigeria  in  Africa.  Small  pro¬ 
vincial  elites  were  found  in  regional  capitals  in  the  sense  that  govern¬ 
ment,  business,  and  tribal  and  religious  leaders  were  recognized  as 
being  “above  the  rest,”  but  they  did  not  constitute  a  distinct  social 
class.  Their  roots  were  frequently  in  the  countryside,  and  they  main¬ 
tained  dual  rural-urban  identities  as  such.  These  subregional  mini¬ 
elites  also  seemed  not  to  share  significant  elements  of  a  common 
value  system,  and  economic  ties  among  them  were  tenuous.  If  a 
national  society  and  elites  were  emerging,  it  was  in  the  Three  Towns 
constituting  the  national  capital  area.  It  was  in  Khartoum,  Khartoum 
North,  and  Omdurman  that  the  national  politicians,  high-level  bureau¬ 
crats,  senior  military,  educated  professionals,  and  wealthy  merchants 


114 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


and  entrepreneurs  lived,  worked,  and  socialized.  Even  those  who  had 
residences  elsewhere  also  maintained  second  family  homes,  espe¬ 
cially  in  Omdurman. 

These  elites  long  recognized  the  usefulness  of  maintaining  a  pres¬ 
ence  in  the  capital  area,  traditionally  living  in  Omdurman,  a  much 
more  Arab  city  than  Khartoum.  The  other  truly  urban  elites  also  used 
to  live  in  Omdurman  until  around  2000,  but  the  concentration  of  the 
North’s  varied  elites  in  one  city  did  not  necessarily  engender  a  com¬ 
mon  social  life.  As  in  many  Arab  and  African  cities,  much  of  Omdur¬ 
man ’s  population  lived  in  separate  if  not  wholly  isolated  quarters. 

By  the  early  2000s,  the  capital  region  had  become  truly  urbanized 
for  the  first  time  in  Sudanese  history,  complete  with  high-rise  buildings, 
overcrowding,  and  monumental  traffic  jams.  The  old  and  so-familiar 
former  pattern  of  life,  in  which  most  educated  Sudanese  knew  each 
other  or  knew  at  least  someone  in  the  other’s  family,  was  no  longer 
possible.  If  there  were  an  in-country  elite,  it  consisted  of  senior  mili¬ 
tary,  senior  civil  servants,  and  senior  academic  figures  alongside  the 
new  and  rising  business  elite  and  those  from  the  (also  new)  worlds  of 
satellite  TV  and  entertainment.  Compared  to  Western  societies,  the 
Sudanese  elite  knew  more  about  each  others’  families  and  lifestyles  but 
did  not  interact  very  closely. 

One  part  of  the  elite  structure  was  not  predominantly  urban,  how¬ 
ever,  although  the  family  headquarters  were  located  in  the  capital 
area.  These  were  the  heads  of  important  religious  groups,  whose 
constituencies  and  sources  of  power  and  wealth  were  largely  rural. 
Leaders  of  large  tribes  were  based  in  their  regions  but  maintained 
family  homes  in  the  capital,  to  which  they  commuted  frequently  and 
where  some  members  of  their  usually  very  large  families  settled. 

Most  of  the  educated  elite  children  whose  families  originated  in  out¬ 
lying  regions  considered  themselves  to  be  “from  Khartoum,”  and  the 
most  educated,  when  asked  about  their  identity,  answered  “Sudanese” 
first  and  foremost.  This  phenomenon  was  quite  new,  and  it  reflected 
disillusion  with  the  politics  and  economics  of  the  “old  Sudan”  in  which 
regional,  tribal,  and  sectarian  affiliations  mattered  greatly,  yet  those 
political  and  social  identities  failed  to  deliver  peace  and  prosperity  and 
increasingly  were  blamed  for  the  failures.  To  the  extent  that  the  North¬ 
ern  elites  were  Muslim  and  Arab — most  being  both — they  shared  an 
overall  religion  and  language  but  were  otherwise  marked  by  differ¬ 
ences  in  interest  and  outlook. 

Still  more  divergent  were  the  elite  Southerners,  most  of  whom  were 
non-Muslims,  few  spoke  Arabic  fluently,  and  they  were  regarded- 
and  saw  themselves — not  primarily  as  a  professional  or  bureaucratic 
elite,  but  as  a  regional  one.  Many  appeared  to  prefer  a  career  in  the

South  to  a  post  in  Khartoum;  indeed,  after  the  Comprehensive  Peace 
Agreement  of  2005  took  effect,  they  moved  to  Rumbek,  Wau,  or  Juba. 
These  elites  exercised  political  power  directly  or  gave  significant  sup¬ 
port  to  those  who  did.  But  so  diverse  and  sometimes  conflicting  were 
their  interests  and  outlooks  that  they  did  not  constitute  a  cohesive 
class. 

Sudanese  society  did  not  develop  a  consensus,  in  terms  of  overarch¬ 
ing  values,  as  to  what  kinds  of  work,  talents,  possessions,  and  back¬ 
ground  were  more  worthy  than  others  and  therefore  conferred  higher 
status.  For  generations  there  were  merchants,  entrepreneurs,  and  reli¬ 
gious  leaders  in  Sudan.  The  latter  enjoyed  a  special  status  through  the 
1980s  but  have  declined  visibly  ever  since.  For  example,  the  prestige 
of  both  the  al-Mahdi  and  al-Mirghani  families  fell  considerably  as  a 
result  of  failures  of  their  political  leaders  in  the  last  two  to  three 
decades.  This  was  strikingly  apparent  in  the  strife-ridden  region  of 
Darfur,  where  all  residents — victims  and  victimizers — not  only  were 
Muslims  but  also  belonged  to  the  same  sect  (Ansar),  yet  their  leader, 
Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  had  virtually  no  influence  over  these  feuding  factions. 
Indeed,  his  automobile  was  stoned  by  an  enraged  mob  during  a  visit  in 
2004;  such  an  event  would  have  been  unthinkable  in  the  1980s.  In  the 
Sudan  of  the  early  2000s,  wealth  and  the  influence  and  power  it  gener¬ 
ated  came  to  carry  greater  status  than  traditional  religious  position. 

The  educated,  secular  elite  was  a  newer  phenomenon,  and  some 
deference  was  given  its  members  by  other  elites.  In  the  Muslim 
North,  the  educated  ranged  from  devotees  of  Islamic  activism  to 
Islamic  reformers  and  a  few  avowed  secularists.  Despite  the  respect 
generally  given  the  educated,  however,  those  at  either  extreme  were 
likely  to  make  members  of  other  elites  uncomfortable. 

The  younger,  larger  generation  of  the  educated  elite  did  not  consist 
entirely  of  offspring  of  the  older,  smaller,  educated  elite.  Many  were 
sons  (and  sometimes  daughters)  of  businessmen,  wealthy  landown¬ 
ers,  and  the  tribal  elite.  A  peculiar  feature  of  the  educated  Sudanese 
was  that  large  numbers  lived  outside  Sudan  for  years  at  a  time,  work¬ 
ing  in  Middle  Eastern  oil-producing  states,  Europe,  or  North  Amer¬ 
ica.  Some  of  their  earnings  came  back  to  Sudan,  but  it  was  not  clear 
that  they  had  much  to  do  with  the  formation  or  characteristics  of  a 
specifically  Sudanese  elite. 

Tribal  and  ethnic  elites  carried  weight  in  specific  localities  and 
might  be  significant  if  the  states  were  to  achieve  substantial  auton¬ 
omy;  however,  their  importance  on  the  national  scene  was  question¬ 
able.  That  they  were  significant  was  apparent  from  what  followed  in 
the  wake  of  an  internal  political  realignment  in  the  country’s  top  lead¬ 
ership  in  1999-2000,  when  some  exiled  politicians  returned,  as  did 


116 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


some  academics  and  well-established  professionals  from  the  oil-pro¬ 
ducing  countries,  Europe,  North  America,  and  even  from  Egypt, 
Kenya,  and  Uganda.  The  quid  pro  quo  for  their  return  was  political 
amnesty  in  exchange  for  an  understanding  to  refrain  from  attacking 
the  government  of  al-Bashir  and  the  National  Congress  Party. 

Socializing  and  intermarriage  among  members  of  the  different 
elites  could  be  significant  in  establishing  a  cohesive  upper  class,  but 
that  had  not  happened  by  the  early  2000s,  except  among  a  few  at 
places  such  as  the  University  of  Khartoum.  It  was  still  easier  for  a 
male  Sudanese  intellectual  to  marry  a  non-Muslim  Westerner  than  a 
Muslim  from  a  different  tribe  and  sect,  although  family  acceptance  of 
such  a  personal  decision  was  on  the  increase. 

After  independence,  the  old  elite  regarded  itself  as  the  arbiter  of 
social  acceptance  into  the  company  of  those  riverine  “Arab”  families 
who  had  long  lived  in  the  Omdurman-Khartoum  area,  had  substantial 
income  from  landholding,  and  had  participated  in  the  higher  reaches 
of  government  during  the  Condominium  or  engaged  in  professions  of 
medicine,  law,  and  the  university.  Men  from  these  families  were  well 
educated.  Few  engaged  in  business,  which  tended  to  be  in  the  hands 
of  families  of  Lebanese,  Syrian,  Greek,  and  at  least  partial  Egyptian 
ancestry. 

Beginning  in  the  late  1960s,  in  the  North  Muslims  of  non-Mediter¬ 
ranean  background  began  to  acquire  substantial  wealth  as  business¬ 
men,  often  as  importers  and  exporters.  These  men  were  relatively 
young  when  they  began  their  entrepreneurial  activity,  and  unlike 
members  of  the  older  elite  families,  they  were  not  well  educated.  By 
the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  however,  many  of  these  businessmen 
had  started  sending  their  children  to  Britain  or  the  United  States  for 
advanced  degrees.  Reflecting  trends  in  other  societies,  whereas  the 
sons  of  the  older  elite  had  been  educated  mainly  for  government 
careers,  in  and  after  the  1980s,  business  education  was  increasingly 
emphasized.  In  contrast  to  the  more  secular  elites  in  the  professions, 
the  civil  service,  and  the  military,  however,  many  members  of  these 
newer  economic  elites  gravitated  toward  religion  and  the  Muslim 
Brotherhood.  By  the  early  2000s,  almost  the  entire  leadership  of  the 
Sudanese  Islamists  had  graduate  degrees,  usually  in  applied  sciences, 
and  most  often  from  Western  universities. 

The  older  elite  typically  used  to  intermarry  and  exclude  those  whose 
backgrounds  they  did  not  know,  even  if  the  families  were  wealthy  and 
successful  in  business,  religion,  or  education.  Gradually,  after  indepen¬ 
dence,  Arabic  speakers  of  other  sedentary  families  acquired  higher  edu¬ 
cation,  entered  the  bureaucracy  or  founded  lucrative  businesses,  and 
began  to  participate  to  a  limited  degree  in  the  social  circle  of  the  older 


117

families.  The  emphasis  on  “good  family”  persisted,  however,  in  most 
marriages.  Sedentary  “Arabs”  were  acceptable,  as  were  some  persons 
of  an  older  mixture  of  “Arab”  and  Nile  Nubian  ancestry,  for  example, 
the  people  around  Dongola.  But  people  from  the  South  and  the  West — 
even  if  Muslims — and  members  of  nomadic  groups  (particularly  the 
darker  Baqqara  Arabs)  were  not.  A  man  from  the  South  might  be 
esteemed  for  his  achievements  and  other  qualities,  but  he  was  not  con¬ 
sidered  an  eligible  husband  for  a  woman  of  a  sedentary  Arab  family. 
There  are  some  exceptions  in  current  times,  as  there  were  decades  ago, 
but  they  are  generally  perceived  as  such. 

Women  and  the  Family 

The  extended  family  continued  to  provide  social  services  in  post- 
2000  Sudan.  Traditionally,  the  family  was  responsible  for  everyone, 
including  the  old,  the  sick,  and  the  mentally  ill,  although  many  of 
these  responsibilities  were  eroded  by  urbanization.  Whether  in  rural 
or  urban  society,  however,  the  burden  of  these  social  services  fell 
heavily  upon  women. 

Except  for  the  small  number  of  liberated,  educated  young  women 
from  families  of  the  elite,  in  the  North  women  remained  within  the 
household  and  were  segregated  at  all  festivities,  usually  eating  after 
the  men.  This  was  particularly  the  case  with  Muslim  households. 
Men  entertained  in  their  own  quarters,  and  males  of  an  extended 
family  ate  together.  In  a  small  family,  the  husband  ate  alone  or,  more 
frequently,  took  his  bowl  to  join  his  male  neighbors. 

A  young  university  couple  might  live  much  as  in  the  West,  in  an 
apartment  or  in  a  small  house  without  relatives,  and  might  live,  eat, 
and  entertain  together.  Nevertheless,  traditional  patterns  were  deeply 
rooted,  and  the  husband  might  often  be  away  visiting  his  male  friends 
in  their  homes,  in  the  market,  or  in  cafes.  At  home  a  servant  helped 
with  the  children.  Although  the  educated  young  married  or  unmarried 
woman  had  greater  mobility  because  of  her  job,  she  was  not  exempt 
from  the  traditional  obligations  and  the  public  supremacy  of  the  Mus¬ 
lim  husband.  She  was  aware  that  her  education  and  job  were  not  a 
license  to  trespass  upon  male-dominated  social  norms. 

The  uneducated  woman  had  greater  freedoms  in  some  respects,  as 
long  as  she  was  with  her  peers;  for  even  among  well-to-do  families,  a 
young  woman  was  restricted  to  her  household  and  female  friends 
until  transferred  to  similar  seclusion  in  the  house  of  her  husband.  Par¬ 
adoxically,  this  segregation  could  cause  a  spirit  of  independence,  par¬ 
ticularly  among  educated  women,  for  there  were  a  host  of  aunts, 
cousins,  and  grandmothers  to  look  after  children  and  allow  mothers  to 
work  outside  the  home.  Nevertheless,  social  traditions  governed  the 


118

way  of  life  of  Sudanese  women.  The  segregation  and  subordination 
of  women  in  Sudanese  society  should  not  obscure  female  domination 
of  the  household  Just  as  their  men  commanded  public  life.  The  home 
and  the  rearing  of  children  were  their  domains — so  long  as  they 
upheld  male-oriented  social  norms. 

Two  traditional  customs  among  women  in  the  North  had  an  enor¬ 
mous  impact  on  their  private  and  social  relationships — the  zar  cult 
and  female  “circumcision.”  Zar  was  the  name  given  to  the  ceremony 
conducted  only  by  women  practitioners  that  was  required  to  pacify 
evil  spirits  and  to  cleanse  women  of  afflictions  caused  by  demons  or 
jinn.  Zar  cults  were  numerous  throughout  Muslim  Africa.  Illnesses, 
including  depression,  infertility,  and  other  organic  and  psychological 
disorders,  were  attributed  to  possession  by  hostile  spirits.  Although 
zar  ceremonies  varied  widely,  they  not  only  freed  the  one  possessed 
but  also  were  great  social  occasions  where  women  could  communi¬ 
cate  together  as  men  did  within  male  circles. 

Female  genital  mutilation,  or  infibulation  (excising  the  external 
genitalia  and  sewing  the  vagina  shut),  was  widely  practiced  throughout 
Muslim  and  Christian  Africa,  and  especially  among  Sudan’s  Northern 
Arab  population.  Enormous  pressure  was  put  on  girls  aged  12  or 
younger,  as  well  as  on  older  women  and  their  families,  to  observe  these 
traditions.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  issue  of  female  genital  mutilation  was  controversial,  however, 
because  of  the  physical  and  psychological  problems  it  caused  women. 
The  practice  was  opposed  by  Sudanese  governments  from  the  Mahdi 
in  the  nineteenth  century  to  the  current  regime  and  by  international 
organizations,  such  as  the  UN.  Midwives  performed  the  operation, 
which  often  led  to  shock,  hemorrhage,  and  septicemia.  It  created  innu¬ 
merable  obstetrical  problems  before  and  after  childbirth  and  through¬ 
out  life.  Despite  international  conferences,  legislation,  and  efforts  to 
eradicate  the  practice,  however,  it  appeared  to  be  on  the  increase  in  the 
early  2000s,  not  only  in  Sudan  but  in  Africa  generally.  At  the  same 
time,  the  adoption  of  Western  medicine  by  the  growing  educated  class 
increasingly  promoted  awareness  of  the  harmful  effects  of  infibula- 
tion.  Legislation  banning  female  genital  mutilation  in  Sudan  was  in 
place  since  before  independence,  with  severe  penalties  for  the  male 
head  of  household  where  it  took  place;  even  so  the  practice  continued 
unabated. 

In  the  South,  the  role  of  women  differed  dramatically  from  that  in 
the  North.  Although  women  were  subordinate  to  men,  they  enjoyed 
much  greater  freedom  within  their  societies.  Female  genital  mutila¬ 
tion  was  not  practiced  and  no  zar  cult  existed,  although  spirits  were 
regularly  consulted  about  public  and  private  affairs  through  practitio¬ 
ners.  Women  had  greater  freedom  of  movement  and,  indeed,  partici¬ 
pated  to  a  limited  degree  in  the  councils  of  lineage.  Husbands 
consulted  their  wives  on  matters  pertaining  to  public  affairs.  Many 
women  also  played  important  roles  in  the  mediation  of  disputes,  and, 
as  of  2007,  one  prominent  woman,  Rebecca  Garang,  had  assumed  a 
responsible  position  in  the  Government  of  South  Sudan.  On  the 
downside,  as  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  defi¬ 
ciency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  began  to  spread,  many  in  the  North 
associated  it  with  “African  licentiousness”  rather  than  with  “free¬ 
dom”  for  women.  As  one  more  cultural  fault  line  along  the  North- 
South  divide,  the  trade-off  for  “freedom”  was  seen  as  not  worth  the 
price  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases. 

Education 

The  education  sector  saw  steady  improvement  in  Sudan  over  the 
1990s  and  early  2000s.  Even  with  constant  unrest  and  unrelenting 
poverty,  the  number  of  children  attending  school  rose,  as  did  literacy 
rates.  Still,  Sudan  lagged  behind  most  of  its  African  counterparts  in 
terms  of  educating  its  youth.  It  also  fell  significantly  below  the  educa¬ 
tion  standards  of  the  Arab  world.  Sudan’s  widely  dispersed  rural  pop¬ 
ulation  made  mass  education  a  difficult  task.  Additionally,  long  years 
of  civil  war  interrupted  schooling  and  displaced  many  families. 


120 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Young  men  and  boys  who  would  otherwise  have  been  enrolled  in 
secondary  schools  instead  enlisted  in  the  fighting.  For  the  most  part, 
male  students  had  to  serve  in  the  army  or  Popular  Defense  Forces  (a 
paramilitary  body  allied  with  the  National  Islamic  Front)  before  they 
could  enroll  in  one  of  the  country’s  universities.  And  if  these  chal¬ 
lenges  were  not  enough,  poverty,  especially  in  the  South,  made 
attending  school  an  impossible  luxury  for  many  children. 

Development  of  the  Education  System 

The  public  and  private  education  systems  inherited  by  the  country 
after  independence  were  designed  more  to  provide  civil  servants  and 
professionals  to  serve  the  colonial  administration  than  to  educate 
Sudanese.  Moreover,  the  distribution  of  facilities,  staff,  and  enroll¬ 
ment  was  biased  in  favor  of  the  needs  of  the  administration  and  a 
Western  curriculum.  Schools  tended  to  be  clustered  in  the  vicinity  of 
Khartoum  and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  other  urban  areas,  although  the 
population  was  predominantly  rural.  This  concentration,  found  at  all 
levels,  was  most  acute  in  education  beyond  the  four-year  primary 
level.  The  North  suffered  from  shortages  of  teachers  and  buildings, 
but  education  in  the  South,  largely  in  the  hands  of  missionaries,  was 
even  more  inadequate.  Civil  strife  and  the  ejection  of  all  foreign  mis¬ 
sionaries  in  February  1964  further  diminished  educational  opportuni¬ 
ties  in  the  South. 

The  demand  for  education  exceeded  Sudan’s  educational  resources. 
At  independence  in  1956,  education  accounted  for  only  15.5  percent 
of  the  Sudanese  budget:  this  to  support  1,778  primary  schools  (enroll¬ 
ment  208,688),  108  intermediate  schools  (enrollment  14,632),  and  49 
government  secondary  schools  (enrollment  5,423).  Higher  education 
was  limited  to  the  University  of  Khartoum.  The  adult  literacy  rate  was 
23  percent.  For  the  first  decade  and  a  half  after  independence,  the  phi¬ 
losophy  and  curriculum  beyond  primary  school  followed  the  British 
education  tradition.  Although  all  students  learned  Arabic  and  English 
in  intermediate  and  secondary  schools,  the  language  of  instruction  at 
the  University  of  Khartoum  was  English.  Sudanese  schools,  in  many 
cases  unable  to  keep  pace  with  the  demand,  relied  heavily  on  foreign 
teachers  to  fill  the  necessary  teaching  slots. 

When  the  al-Numayri-led  government  took  power  in  1 969,  it  consid¬ 
ered  the  education  system  inadequate  for  the  needs  of  social  and  eco¬ 
nomic  development.  Its  governing  philosophy,  “Arab  Socialism,”  was 
heavily  influenced  by  the  Egyptian  model  under  Gamal  Abdel  Nasser. 
Accordingly,  an  extensive  reorganization  was  proposed,  which  would 
eventually  make  the  new  six-year  elementary  program  compulsory  and 
would  pay  much  attention  to  technical  and  vocational  education  at  all 


121 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


levels.  Previously,  primary  and  intermediate  school  had  been  preludes 
to  secondary  training,  and  secondary  school  prepared  students  for  the 
university.  The  system  produced  some  well-trained  university  gradu¬ 
ates,  but  the  great  bulk  of  students  who  did  not  go  as  far  as  the  univer¬ 
sity,  or  even  secondary  school,  received  little  training  to  prepare  them 
for  technical  work  or  skilled  labor. 

The  government  education  system  had  been  largely  reorganized  by 
the  late  1970s.  There  were  some  preprimary  schools,  mainly  in  urban 
areas.  The  basic  system  consisted  of  a  six-year  curriculum  in  primary 
schools  and  a  three-year  curriculum  in  junior  secondary  (middle  or 
general)  schools.  From  there,  qualified  students  could  go  on  to  the 
three-year  upper-secondary  level,  which  prepared  students  for  higher 
education;  commercial  and  agricultural  technical  schools;  and  teacher¬ 
training  secondary  schools  designed  to  prepare  primary-school  teach¬ 
ers.  Postsecondary  education  included  universities,  higher  technical 
schools,  and  teacher-training  colleges  to  train  junior-  and  upper-sec¬ 
ondary  school  teachers.  Of  the  more  than  5,400  primary  schools  in 
1980,  fewer  than  14  percent  were  located  in  the  South,  home  to  about 
25  percent  of  the  country’s  population.  Many  of  the  schools  there  were 
established  during  the  Southern  Regional  Administration  (1972-81). 
The  renewal  of  the  civil  war  in  mid- 1983  destroyed  many  schools, 
although  the  SPLA  operated  schools  in  areas  under  its  control.  Never¬ 
theless,  many  teachers  and  students  were  among  the  refugees  who  fled 
the  ravages  of  the  war  in  the  South. 

In  the  early  1980s,  the  number  of  junior-secondary  schools  was  a  lit¬ 
tle  more  than  one-fifth  the  number  of  primary  schools;  only  about  6.5 
percent  of  them  were  in  the  South.  There  were  just  190  upper-second- 
ary  schools  in  the  public  system  in  1980,  but  it  was  at  this  level  that  pri¬ 
vate  schools  of  varying  quality  proliferated,  particularly  in  the  three 
cities  of  the  capital  area.  Despite  the  emphasis  on  technical  education, 
there  were  only  35  technical  schools  in  Sudan,  less  than  one-fifth  the 
number  of  academic  upper-secondary  schools.  In  1976-77  eight  times 
as  many  students  entered  the  academic  stream  as  entered  the  technical 
schools;  moreover,  prospective  employers  often  found  technical-school 
graduates  inadequately  trained,  a  consequence  of  sometimes  irrelevant 
curricula,  low  teacher  morale,  and  lack  of  equipment.  The  technical 
schools  were  meant  to  include  institutions  for  training  skilled  workers 
in  agriculture,  but  few  of  the  schools  were  directed  to  that  end,  most  of 
them  turning  out  workers  more  useful  in  the  urban  areas. 

The  hope  for  universal  and  compulsory  education  had  not  been 
realized  by  the  early  1980s,  but  as  a  goal  it  nonetheless  led  to  a  more 
equitable  distribution  of  facilities  and  teachers  in  rural  areas  and  in  the 
South.  During  the  1980s,  the  government  established  more  schools  at 


122 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


all  levels  and  with  them,  more  teacher-training  schools,  although 
these  were  never  sufficient  to  provide  adequate  staff.  The  process  was 
inherently  slow  and  was  made  slower  by  limited  funds  and  by  inade¬ 
quate  compensation  for  staff  Teachers  who  could  not  find  suitable 
employment  inside  or  outside  Sudan  abandoned  the  field  of  education 
altogether. 

The  revolutionary  government  of  Colonel  (later  Lieutenant  Gen¬ 
eral)  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al-Bashir  announced  sweeping  reforms  in 
Sudanese  education  in  September  1990.  In  consultation  with  leaders 
of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  and  Islamist  teachers  and  administrators, 
who  were  the  strongest  supporters  of  his  regime,  al-Bashir  proclaimed 
a  new  philosophy  of  education  in  which  instruction  was  to  be  cast 
along  Islamist  lines.  He  decreed  that  the  number  of  university  students 
be  doubled  and  that  Arabic  replace  English  as  the  language  of  instruc¬ 
tion  in  universities.  The  government  strictly  controlled  curricula  and 
dismissed  instructors  who  opposed  the  reforms.  To  implement  these 
changes,  al-Bashir  pledged  substantially  increased  financing.  From 
1992  to  2004,  the  central  government  allocated  8  percent  of  its  overall 
budget  to  education,  eight  times  the  figure  for  health  but  some  28  per¬ 
cent  of  that  for  defense. 

Primary  and  Secondary  Education 

A  series  of  decrees  and  laws  issued  during  the  1990s  established 
the  parameters  of  Sudan’s  new  education  system.  In  1992  a  compre¬ 
hensive  reform  of  primary  and  secondary  education  was  undertaken 
that  provides  for  11  years  of  schooling  in  three  stages — preschool, 
basic,  and  secondary.  Long-term  goals  included  not  only  universal 
primary  education  but  also  an  increase  in  vocational  training  and  in 
female  enrollment.  In  1995  the  government  established  the  Federal 
Ministry  of  Education  and  charged  it  with  administration,  curriculum, 
and  teacher  preparation.  In  1998  a  so-called  Compulsion  Law  man¬ 
dated  that  all  children  aged  six  to  1 3  be  enrolled  in  school,  a  law  that 
was  little  enforced. 

Education  officials  implemented  the  new  three-stage  education 
ladder  and  curriculum  between  2002  and  2004.  Following  a  two-year 
preschool  program,  the  ladder  was  composed  of  basic  and  secondary 
instruction,  a  concept  that  differed  from  the  elementary,  intermediate, 
and  secondary  levels  of  former  years.  The  basic  level  began  at  age  six 
and  encompassed  the  next  eight  years  of  instruction,  followed  by 
three  years  of  secondary  study,  for  a  total  of  1 1  years.  Longer  school 
years  compensated  for  the  former  twelfth  year  of  study  and  allowed 
students  earlier  entrance  into  the  national  workforce.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  basic  school  curriculum  was  structured  around  the  themes  of 
religion,  language,  mathematics,  man  and  the  universe,  expressional 
arts,  and  applied  arts.  This  stage  was  divided  into  three  cycles,  the  last 
of  which  were  the  seventh  and  eighth  grades.  Completion  of  the  basic 
level  terminated  the  fonnal  education  of  about  half  of  all  pupils.  The 
abolition  of  the  distinction  between  academic  and  technical  instruc¬ 
tion  was  a  goal  at  the  secondary  level.  Hence,  students  studied  a  vari¬ 
ety  of  subjects  drawn  from  both  curricula,  although  language  (Arabic 
and  English),  religion,  mathematics,  and  science  were  core  subjects 
common  to  all  three  secondary  grades.  Instruction  in  schools  in  the 
North  was  in  Arabic.  Ministry  officials  hoped  that  instruction  in  both 
academic  and  technical  subjects  would  better  prepare  students  for 
gainful  employment  once  they  completed  their  secondary  education. 

Parallel  with  this  fonnal  education  system  was  a  less  formal  pro¬ 
gram  of  primary  instruction.  It  consisted  of  four  years  of  enrollment 
in  a  compressed  basic-level  curriculum  designed  to  meet  the  needs  of 
out-of-school  students  aged  nine  to  14.  After  completing  this  course 
of  study,  students  were  expected  to  be  eligible  to  enroll  in  mainstream 
secondary  schools. 

The  2004  and  2005  peace  accords  between  the  national  government 
and  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement/ Army  foresaw  change 
in  national  education.  The  accords  called  for  creation  of  educational 
opportunities  for  those  affected  by  war,  for  parallel  systems  of  educa¬ 
tion  to  run  in  the  North  and  the  South  during  the  six-year  interim 
period,  and  for  free  education  in  Southern  states.  Both  Arabic  and 
English  were  recognized  as  official  working  languages  of  the  national 
government  and  as  languages  of  instruction  in  higher  education. 

The  Ministry  of  Education  reported  that  for  the  academic  year 
2009-10,  there  were  6.3  million  primary  students  enrolled  in  nearly 
20,000  schools,  of  which  more  than  18,000  were  government  schools 
and  some  1,600  were  nongovernment  schools.  Comparable  enrollment 
in  1997-98  was  3  million.  At  the  secondary  level,  the  ministry  counted 
761,200  students  and  nearly  3,000  schools,  including  163  technical 
schools  and  15  Islamic  studies  institutions.  These  figures  compared 
with  486,000  students  in  2001-2  and  461,000  in  1997-98.  UN  figures 
for  2008  showed  a  national  adult  literacy  rate  (ages  1 5  and  older  who 
could  read  and  write)  of  69  percent  as  compared  with  61  percent  in 
2004,  when  the  literacy  rate  for  women  was  only  52  percent  compared 
with  71  percent  for  men.  Statistics  for  2009  from  the  Southern  Sudan 
Ministry  of  Education  showed  that  of  the  population  1 5  years  of  age 
and  older,  27  percent  were  literate  (40  percent  for  males,  1 6  percent  for 
females).

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  early  2,000s  saw  a  steady  increase  in  the  number  of  children 
enrolled  in  preschool  education  despite  warfare  and  large-scale  inter¬ 
nal  displacement;  as  of  2000,  about  one-quarter  of  the  population  had 
access  to  such  programs.  Between  1990  and  1998,  the  number  of  chil¬ 
dren  attending  preschool  increased  annually  by  3.9  percent,  with  even 
higher  rates  of  growth  for  girls.  Enrollment  rates  in  basic  and  second¬ 
ary  education  have  also  shown  steady  growth,  more  so  in  the  North 
and  in  urban  areas.  Education  officials  also  reported  progress  toward 
achievement  of  gender  equality  at  all  levels  of  schooling,  particularly 
in  the  North. 

Sudan  held  a  national  symposium  on  education  in  2001,  which 
established  a  number  of  education  targets  for  both  2005  and  2015.  The 
targets  focused  primarily  on  increasing  the  percentage  of  children  in 
school  and  decreasing  the  gender  disparity.  The  government  con¬ 
cluded  that  to  fund  education  and  improve  facilities,  local  communi¬ 
ties  should  pay  50  percent  of  the  annual  expense  to  educate  their 
children,  a  minimum  of  US$26  per  student.  Many  communities,  how¬ 
ever,  could  not  raise  such  funds.  Thus,  while  improvements  were 
planned,  some  would  be  difficult  to  realize. 

Educational  Opportunity 

The  government  provided  free  primary  education  for  children  aged 
six  to  14,  at  least  in  theory.  Attendance  rates  were  always  low,  and 
school  closings  resulted  from  civil  conflict.  Still,  some  encouraging 
trends  emerged.  In  1 996,  for  example,  only  44  percent  of  the  age-rele¬ 
vant  population  attended  school  in  Sudan.  More  boys  (47  percent)  than 
girls  (40  percent)  attended  school  at  this  point.  The  World  Bank  esti¬ 
mated  the  primary-school  enrollment  rate  at  60  percent  in  2004,  with  a 
49-percent  completion  rate;  comparable  figures  for  2000  were  5 1  per¬ 
cent  enrollment  and  39  percent  completion.  Secondary  enrollment  in 
2004  was  33  percent  compared  with  26  percent  in  2000.  However,  data 
from  a  2006  household  health  survey  in  North  and  South  Sudan  showed 
that  only  53.7  percent  of  children  were  attending  primary  school, 
although  this  figure  probably  did  not  fully  reflect  increasing  enroll¬ 
ments  in  the  South.  Unfortunately,  many  students  came  to  school  or  not 
as  their  situations  allowed,  and  perhaps  half  or  more  were  unable  to 
complete  the  education  program  mandated  by  the  national  government. 

Far  greater  access  to  education  existed  in  the  states  in  the  North  than 
in  those  in  the  South.  According  to  the  Sudanese  government,  in  1980- 
8 1  there  were  903  primary  and  intermediate  schools  in  the  South  with  a 
total  enrollment  of  166,000  pupils.  A  1998  to  2001  UN  survey  in  the 
three  main  regions  of  the  South  and  part  of  the  Nuba  Mountains 
counted  1,096  schools  with  an  enrollment  of  about  228,000  pupils;  a 


125 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


parallel  assessment  by  the  SPLM  reported  1,500  schools  with  508,000 
pupils  out  of  an  estimated  1  million  children  aged  seven  to  14.  Both 
studies  clearly  showed  only  a  minority  of  eligible  school  children  were 
enrolled  in  Southern  schools  in  the  early  2000s.  Further,  of  those 
enrolled,  most — 60  percent — were  in  the  first  two  grades;  only  12  per¬ 
cent  of  pupils  reached  the  upper  grades,  with  fewer  than  1  percent  in 
eighth-grade  classes.  For  the  same  years,  the  UN  reported  that  80  per¬ 
cent  of  eligible  children  in  the  North  attended  elementary  school. 

Several  factors  accounted  for  low  enrollment  in  the  South,  among 
them  a  strong  bias  against  educating  girls.  Of  the  approximately 
228,000  primary  enrollees  in  the  1998-2001  UN  survey,  only  26  per¬ 
cent  were  female,  and  they  were  concentrated  in  the  lowest  grades.  It 
should  be  no  surprise  that  illiteracy  rates  for  women  in  the  South 
were  among  the  highest  in  the  world.  Young  women  were  often 
deterred  from  education  by  demands  for  labor  at  home  and  by  early 
marriage.  Although  boys  enjoyed  preferential  opportunities,  they,  too, 
helped  with  farming  and  herding,  and  before  2005  young  men  often 
left  home  to  fight  against  the  central  government. 

Regardless  of  gender,  the  infrastructure  for  education  in  the  South 
paled  compared  with  even  the  modest  educational  assets  of  the  North. 
Many  children  who  did  attend  school  never  saw  the  inside  of  an 
actual  classroom.  According  to  the  UN,  as  of  2003,  some  43  percent 
of  classes  taught  in  the  South  took  place  outdoors,  often  with  only  the 
shade  of  a  tree  for  shelter.  Only  12  percent  of  classes  in  the  South 
took  place  in  a  permanent  classroom  compared  with  60  percent  in  the 
North.  School  buildings,  if  they  once  existed,  had  been  destroyed  by 
decades  of  warfare  or  needed  substantial  repair,  and  most  teachers  did 
not  have  access  to  essential  educational  tools  such  as  books  and  state- 
prepared  curricula. 

The  South  also  suffered  from  a  lack  of  qualified  teachers.  In  2006 
the  Government  of  Southern  Sudan  reported  that  half  of  its  teachers 
had  only  a  primary  education  and  no  further  training  for  their  duties. 
Many  taught  voluntarily.  At  some  schools,  parents  had  to  pay  a  regis¬ 
tration  fee  to  enroll  their  children;  this  fee  provided  remuneration  for 
teachers.  In  other  instances,  teachers  received  only  food  or  other  bar¬ 
ter  items  as  forms  of  pay. 

The  peace  agreements  signed  in  2004  and  2005  paved  the  way  for 
a  better-balanced,  national  education  system.  The  2004  protocol,  in 
particular,  called  for  creation  of  educational  opportunities  for  those 
affected  by  war,  for  parallel  systems  of  education  to  run  in  the  North 
and  the  South  during  the  six-year  interim  period,  and  for  adequate 
and  free  education  to  be  provided  across  the  Southern  states.  Practical 
realities,  especially  as  regards  funding,  would  make  improvement  in 


126 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Southern  education  a  long  and  slow  process,  one  that  would  undoubt¬ 
edly  require  substantial  assistance  from  foreign  donors. 

In  response  to  the  need,  international  agencies  such  as  the  World 
Food  Programme  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International 
Development  (USAID)  were  funding  construction  of  classrooms  across 
the  South  as  of  2005.  A  year  later,  the  UN  had  undertaken  to  construct 
up  to  250  new  schools  and  to  provide  school  supplies.  Southerners  and 
other  long-neglected  peoples  in  Darfur  and  Eastern  Sudan  could  also 
expect  to  benefit  from  expanding  educational  facilities  and  from  less- 
formal  education  programs. 

Other  initiatives  aimed  specifically  at  expanding  educational  oppor¬ 
tunity  were  part  of  Sudan’s  planning.  First,  the  government  started  to 
respond  to  the  education  needs  that  stemmed  from  internal  displace¬ 
ment.  With  the  help  of  international  organizations,  displaced  students 
began  to  receive  education  in  their  temporary  communities.  A  second 
program  was  designed  to  address  the  problem  of  education  among 
nomadic  groups,  at  least  80  of  which  still  existed  in  Sudan.  Many 
resided  in  North  Kordofan  State,  where  most  primary  schools,  sup¬ 
ported  with  UN  funds,  went  only  through  fourth  grade.  In  2009  Suda¬ 
nese  education  officials  began  a  shift  from  mobile  schools  to  stationary 
schools,  including  boarding  schools,  for  the  estimated  500,000  nomadic 
children  of  primary  age  in  the  North.  They  hoped  to  increase  enrollment 
from  32  percent  to  70  percent  by  2011,  improve  the  relevance  of  the 
curriculum,  and  provide  more  trained  teachers.  A  third  initiative,  also 
launched  in  2009,  aimed  at  increasing  the  enrollment  of  girls  in  primary 
schools  in  the  North  by  more  than  1  million  by  201 1. 

Female  Education 

Girls’  education  was  traditionally  of  the  most  rudimentary  kind, 
frequently  provided  in  Muslim  areas  by  a  khalwa,  or  religious  school, 
in  which  Quranic  studies  were  taught.  Such  basic  schools  did  not  pre¬ 
pare  girls  for  the  secular  learning  mainstream,  from  which  they  were 
virtually  excluded.  By  1920  the  government  had  provided  five  ele¬ 
mentary  schools  for  girls.  Expansion  was  slow,  however,  and  female 
education  remained  restricted  to  the  elementary  level  until  1940, 
when  the  first  intermediate  school  for  girls,  the  Omdurman  Girls’ 
Intermediate  School,  opened.  By  1955  there  were  10  such  schools.  In 
1956  the  Omdurman  Secondary  School  for  Girls,  with  about  265  stu¬ 
dents,  was  the  only  girls’  secondary  school  operated  by  the  govern¬ 
ment.  By  1960  there  were  only  two  upper-secondary  schools  for  girls 
and  no  vocational  schools  except  for  the  Nurses’  Training  College 
with  just  1 1  students,  nursing  not  being  regarded  by  many  Sudanese 
as  a  suitable  vocation  for  women.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


This  slow  development  of  girls’  education  was  the  product  of  tra¬ 
dition.  Parents  of  Sudanese  girls  tended  to  look  upon  girls’  schools 
with  suspicion,  if  not  fear,  that  they  would  corrupt  the  morals  of  their 
daughters.  Moreover,  preference  was  given  to  sons,  who,  if  educated, 
could  advance  themselves  in  society  to  the  pride  and  profit  of  the 
family,  something  girls  could  not  do.  Their  value  was  enhanced  not  at 
school  but  at  home  in  preparation  for  marriage  and  the  dowry  that 
accompanied  the  ceremony.  Finally,  the  lack  of  schools  discouraged 
even  those  who  desired  elementary  education  for  their  daughters. 

Female  education  claimed  approximately  one-third  of  all  available 
educational  resources  by  1970,  when  there  were  1,086  primary 
schools,  268  intermediate  schools,  and  52  vocational  schools  for  girls. 
Among  notable  successes  with  female  education  was  Ahfad  Univer¬ 
sity  for  Women  in  Omdurman.  Originally  founded  in  1907  as  a  pri¬ 
mary  school  for  girls,  in  the  early  2000s  it  was  the  oldest  and  largest 
private  university  in  Sudan,  having  evolved  into  the  premier  women’s 
university  with  an  enrollment  approaching  5,000  in  2006.  It  offered  a 
mixture  of  academic  and  practical  programs,  such  as  those  that  edu¬ 
cated  women  to  teach  in  rural  areas.  The  newly  wealthy  elites  consid¬ 
ered  Ahfad  as  the  first  choice  for  their  daughters,  and  its  graduates 
often  went  on  to  advanced  studies  abroad.  Stipends  were  also  avail¬ 
able  to  women  students  of  modest  means,  a  step  toward  improving 
access  by  females  to  education  at  all  levels. 

Higher  Education 

Sudan  in  2005  was  home  to  27  public  universities  and  at  least  46 
private  universities  and  colleges,  the  vast  majority  of  them  in  the 
North.  These  institutions  enrolled  447,000  students,  69,000  of  whom 
completed  their  studies.  Comparable  figures  for  1997-98  were 
152,000  students  and  26,000  graduates  (public  institutions  only).  In 
2007-8,  more  than  50,000  students  graduated  from  public  universities. 
The  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  reported  that  in  2009-10,  about 
513,000  students  were  attending  public  and  private  universities. 
Before  2005,  instruction  was  solely  in  Arabic  with  few  exceptions, 
among  which  was  the  University  of  Juba;  teaching  in  English  there 
recommenced  as  stipulated  in  the  peace  agreement  of  2005.  Admis¬ 
sion  was  open  to  students  with  the  highest  scores  on  the  Sudan  School 
Certificate  examination,  which  was  administered  at  the  conclusion  of 
secondary  school.  Males  usually  had  to  serve  in  the  military  before 
they  could  enter  the  university.  These  requirements,  along  with  the 
country’s  overall  poverty,  constrained  university  enrollment. 

Sudan’s  first  university,  the  University  of  Khartoum,  opened  in 
1902.  It  began  as  Gordon  Memorial  College,  a  secondary  school,  and

then  became  affiliated  with  the  University  of  London  in  1937,  offering 
bachelor’s  degrees.  In  1956,  at  independence,  it  became  a  fully  inde¬ 
pendent  degree-granting  institution.  The  University  of  Khartoum, 
with  four  campuses,  remained  the  country’s  flagship  university,  but 
even  it  was  not  immune  to  the  pressures  of  politics  and  war.  About  70 
faculty  who  opposed  al-Bashir’s  Islamist  reforms  were  dismissed  in 
the  early  1990s,  and  in  January  1997,  the  university  closed  temporar¬ 
ily  to  allow  students  to  join  the  armed  forces. 

Most  observers  agreed  that  by  the  early  2000s,  this  once-elite  institu¬ 
tion  in  Africa  had  become  a  mere  shadow  of  its  former  self.  Successive 
purges  of  the  faculty  following  the  1964,  1969,  and  1989  “revolutions” 
had  deprived  the  campus  of  some  of  its  best  talent.  Lowered  standards 
in  secondary  schools  as  a  result  of  the  “socialist”  experiment  in  the 
1970s,  combined  with  the  disappearance  of  English  as  the  language  of 
instruction  in  secondary  and  university  systems  after  1990,  continued 
to  reduce  the  quality  of  incoming  students.  These  developments  at  the 
nation’s  premier  university  were  replicated  throughout  the  higher  edu¬ 
cation  establishment. 

Higher  education  was  primarily  the  domain  of  Northern  Sudanese 
after  independence,  particularly  those  living  in  the  capital  region.  In  the 
mid-1970s,  there  were  four  universities,  1 1  colleges,  and  23  institutes  in 
Sudan.  The  universities  were  in  the  capital  area,  and  all  institutions  of 
higher  learning  were  in  the  North.  Colleges  in  Sudan  were  specialized 
degree-granting  entities;  institutes  granted  diplomas  and  certificates  for 
periods  of  study  shorter  than  those  commonly  demanded  at  universities 
and  colleges.  These  postsecondary  institutions  and  universities  had  pro¬ 
vided  Sudan  with  a  substantial  number  of  well-educated  persons  in 
some  fields  but  left  it  short  of  technical  personnel  and  specialists  in  sci¬ 
ences  relevant  to  the  country’s  largely  rural  character.  By  1 980  two  new 
universities  had  opened,  one  at  Wad  Madani  (University  of  Gezira)  and 
the  other  in  Juba.  By  1990  some  institutes  had  been  upgraded  to  col¬ 
leges,  and  many  had  become  part  of  an  autonomous  body  called  the 
Khartoum  Institute  of  Technical  Colleges  (also  referred  to  as  Khartoum 
Polytechnic).  Some  of  its  affiliates  were  outside  the  capital  area,  for 
example,  the  College  of  Mechanical  Engineering  at  Atbarah,  northeast 
of  Khartoum,  and  Al-Gezira  College  of  Agriculture  and  Natural 
Resources  at  Abu  Naamah  in  Al-Awsat. 

The  1990s  saw  a  major  expansion  of  higher  education  in  regions  out¬ 
side  the  traditional  Northern  hub.  A  number  of  new  universities  were 
established,  among  them  Kordofan,  Darfur,  Blue  Nile  (at  Al-Damazin), 
Bahr  al-Ghazal,  Upper  Nile,  and  Al-Imam  Al-Mahdi  (at  Kosti).  In  a 
parallel  development,  a  number  of  provincial  colleges  were  upgraded  to 
university  status,  including  those  at  Nyala,  Dongola,  Port  Sudan,  Kas- 


130

sala,  and  Al-Gedaref.  In  1993  Al-Neelain  University  was  created  when 
the  Sudanese  government  took  over  the  former  Khartoum  branch  of 
Cairo  University,  originally  founded  in  1955.  In  August  2006,  however, 
ground  was  broken  in  Khartoum  for  a  new  campus  of  Cairo  University, 
and  plans  existed  for  a  branch  of  Egypt’s  Alexandria  University  to  open 
in  Juba. 

Various  institutions  were  designed  for  specific  training.  The  Islamic 
University  of  Omdurman,  founded  in  1921,  existed  primarily  to  train 
Muslim  religious  judges  and  scholars.  The  Al-Gezira  College  of  Agri¬ 
culture  and  Natural  Resources,  set  in  Sudan’s  most  fertile  agricultural 
region,  focused  on  protecting  and  utilizing  Sudan’s  environmental 
resources.  Ahfad  University  for  Women  in  Omdurman  was  the  premier 
women’s  education  institution  in  Sudan.  Of  particular  interest  is  the 
case  of  Omdurman  Ahlia  University.  Academics,  professionals,  and 
businessmen  founded  it  in  1982  to  meet  the  ever-growing  demand  for 
higher  education  and  practical  training.  Support  came  mainly  from  pri¬ 
vate  donations  and  foreign  foundations  as  well  as  from  the  government. 
Its  curriculum,  taught  in  English  and  oriented  to  job  training  pertinent 
to  the  needs  of  Sudan,  proved  popular. 

The  expansion  of  higher  education  in  the  1990s  was  not  accompanied 
by  an  increase  in  funding;  hence,  the  share  of  funds  allocated  to  each 
institution  was  less  than  what  was  needed  for  full  operation.  Conse¬ 
quently,  buildings,  laboratories,  libraries,  and  other  facilities  deteriorated 
seriously,  especially  at  older  institutions,  along  with  the  qualifications  of 
the  student  body.  The  impact  of  Arabization  and  Islamization  of  the  uni¬ 
versities’  curricula  produced  a  preoccupation  among  students  with  the 
passing  of  examinations  rather  than  with  the  development  of  skills  of 
analysis  and  critical  thinking.  The  economic  surge  resulting  from  petro¬ 
leum  exports  gave  hope  that  these  trends  might  be  reversed.  In  addition, 
after  the  signing  of  the  CPA  in  2005,  there  was  some  improvement  in 
the  relationship  between  the  government  and  the  faculty  and  students  in 
the  universities. 

In  the  South,  the  University  of  Juba,  opened  in  1977,  began  as  an 
institution  to  provide  training  for  economic  development  and  for  the  civil 
service  in  the  region.  After  the  outbreak  of  hostilities  in  1983,  the  school 
moved  to  Khartoum  for  security  reasons.  Following  the  signing  of  the 
peace  agreement  in  2005,  preparations  began  for  the  return  to  Juba, 
although  as  of  early  2011,  most  faculty  and  administration  remained  in 
Khartoum.  Two  other  Khartoum-based  Southern  universities,  Bahr  al- 
Ghazal  in  Wau,  and  Upper  Nile  in  Malakal,  both  founded  in  1991,  also 
prepared  to  relocate  to  the  South.  A  fourth  university,  Northern  Bahr  al- 
Ghazal,  was  established  in  201 1  in  Aweil.  Several  other  campuses  were 
either  established  or  planned  in  Southern  Sudan  as  of  early  2011.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Health 

Sudan’s  health-care  system  languished  for  many  years  before  2005, 
because  of  constant  warfare  in  the  country.  Aside  from  the  country’s 
sheer  size  and  the  general  lack  of  communication  and  transportation 
systems,  the  destruction  of  health  facilities  combined  with  the  scatter¬ 
ing  of  communities  made  establishing  a  modem,  effective  health-care 
system  nearly  impossible.  Most  of  the  country’s  huge  number  of  dis¬ 
placed  persons  received  only  irregular  health-care  treatment,  if  they 
received  any  at  all.  International  organizations  such  as  the  World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  other  aid-dispensing  agencies  were 
instrumental  in  caring  for  the  vast  displaced  population.  Serious  but 
controllable  diseases,  such  as  malaria  and  dysentery,  remained  constant 
threats,  as  did  malnutrition.  The  continual  movement  of  peoples  fleeing 
war  made  containing  such  diseases  even  more  difficult  than  in  other 
developing  countries. 

Regional  Disparities 

It  is  difficult  to  generalize  about  health  care  in  Sudan  because  of  the 
great  disparity  between  the  major  urban  areas  and  the  rest  of  the  coun¬ 
try.  Indeed,  the  availability  of  health  care  in  urban  settings  is  one  cause 
of  rural  to  urban  migration.  In  terms  of  access  to  health  care,  Sudan  can 
be  subdivided  into  three  categories:  distinctly  rural,  rural  near  urban 
areas,  and  the  capital  region.  In  rural  areas,  especially  outlying  prov¬ 
inces,  standard  health  care  is  completely  absent.  For  the  most  part,  there 
are  neither  doctors  nor  clinics  in  these  regions.  When  illness  occurs, 
home  remedies  and  rest  are  often  the  only  potential  “treatments”  avail¬ 
able,  along  with  a  visit  to  a  faqih  or  to  a  sorcerer,  depending  on  region 
and  location.  Rural  areas  near  cities  or  with  access  to  bus  or  rail  lines 
are  slightly  more  fortunate.  Small  primary-care  units  staffed  by  knowl¬ 
edgeable,  if  not  fully  certified,  health  workers  dispense  rudimentary 
care  and  advice  and  also  issue  referrals  to  proper  clinics  in  urban  areas. 
Provincial  capitals  have  doctors  and  hospitals  but  in  insufficient  num¬ 
bers  and  of  insufficient  quality  to  meet  rising  demand. 

The  Three  Towns  of  the  capital  region  boast  the  best  medical  facil¬ 
ities  and  doctors  in  the  country,  although  many  of  these  would  still  be 
considered  substandard  in  other  parts  of  the  world.  Here,  health  care 
is  available  in  three  types  of  facilities:  the  overcrowded,  poorly  main¬ 
tained,  and  underequipped  government  hospitals;  private  clinics  with 
adequate  facilities  and  equipment,  often  operated  by  foreign-educated 
doctors  and  charging  prices  affordable  only  by  the  middle  and  upper 
classes;  and  public  clinics  run  by  Islamist  da  ’wa  (religiously  based 
charities)  or  by  Christian  missionaries,  where  adequate  health  care  is 


132 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


available  for  a  nominal  fee.  Not  surprisingly,  many  patients  flock  to 
the  third  category  where  it  is  available. 

The  civil  war  in  the  South  destroyed  virtually  all  the  region’s  medi¬ 
cal  facilities  except  those  that  the  SPLA  rebuilt  to  treat  their  own 
wounded  and  hospitals  located  in  the  three  major  towns — Malakal, 
Wau,  and  Juba — controlled  by  regional  government  forces.  Even  these 
facilities  receive  little  use  because  they  lack  the  most  basic  medical 
supplies.  International  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  and 
faith-based  groups  are  the  main  providers  of  care,  in  an  uncoordinated 
manner,  and  estimates  indicate  that  less  than  one-third  of  the  popula¬ 
tion  has  access  to  adequate  health  services.  Few  highly  trained  health 
professionals  remain  in  the  region  regardless  of  facilities.  In  1981  there 
had  been  about  60  physicians  in  the  South  for  a  population  of  roughly 
5  million,  or  one  for  approximately  83,000  persons.  By  WHO’s  count 
in  2004,  only  30  fully  qualified  doctors  served  the  region’s  population. 
An  additional  806  medical  assistants  and  nurses  provided  skilled  care, 
while  721  laboratory  technicians  and  2,603  primary  health  care  work¬ 
ers  provided  more  basic  health  services — a  total  of  4,160  personnel  to 
serve  a  population  estimated  to  be  in  excess  of  8  million.  In  the  late 
2000s,  WHO  reported  that  malnutrition  was  widespread  there  (45  per¬ 
cent  among  the  general  population,  compared  to  40  percent  nationwide 
in  the  early  2000s),  children  suffered  from  a  wide  variety  of  maladies, 
and  vaccination  rates  were  low  (17  percent  were  fully  immunized  in 
2006  according  to  a  Southern  health  survey  that  year). 

WHO  responded  to  the  emergency  situation  in  the  South  in  1989, 
and  since  then  the  organization  has  continued  to  provide  humanitarian 
assistance  in  the  region.  In  2004  WHO  expanded  its  efforts  into  control 
of  major  communicable  diseases  and  general  rehabilitation  of  health¬ 
care  facilities  and  services.  In  early  2006,  the  World  Bank  granted  the 
new  Government  of  South  Sudan  US$225  million  to  improve  the 
administrative  capacity  of  its  Ministry  of  Health,  rehabilitate  existing 
facilities  and  build  new  ones,  and  improve  health-care  delivery  to  the 
two-thirds  or  more  of  the  population  beyond  reach  of  such  services. 

WHO  maintained  offices  in  the  capitals  of  each  of  Darfur’s  three 
states  in  2005  and  oversaw  the  effort  to  provide  health  services  there. 
More  than  13,000  national  and  international  personnel  were  involved  in 
providing  food,  clean  water,  sanitation,  primary  health  care,  and  medical 
drugs  to  the  region’s  refugees.  In  2006,  some  2.5  million  Darfuri  were 
in  need  of  assistance,  and  an  estimated  22  percent  of  children  suffered 
from  acute  malnutrition,  the  same  percentage  as  in  the  South.  Reliable 
information  on  Eastern  Sudan  was  scarce,  but  overall  health  conditions 
could  be  gauged  from  under-five  child  mortality  rates  per  1,000  live 
births.  In  2005  WHO  reported  that  these  ranged  from  1 17  in  Al-Gedaref 


133

State,  to  165  in  Red  Sea,  to  172  in  Blue  Nile,  all  high  even  by  standards 
of  comparable  developing  countries. 

Health  Care 

Efforts  to  bolster  health  care  in  the  country  waxed  and  waned  with 
the  vicissitudes  of  war.  In  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  the  govern¬ 
ment  undertook  programs  to  deal  with  specific  diseases  in  limited 
areas,  with  help  from  WHO  and  other  humanitarian  organizations. 
The  Sudanese  government  also  initiated  more  general  approaches  to 
the  problems  of  health  maintenance  in  rural  areas,  particularly  in  the 
South,  including  the  construction  of  health-care  facilities  and  provi¬ 
sion  of  advice  about  nutrition  and  disease  control.  These  efforts  began 
against  a  background  of  inadequate  and  unequal  distribution  of  medi¬ 
cal  personnel  and  facilities.  As  of  1982,  there  were  nearly  2,200  phy¬ 
sicians  in  Sudan,  or  roughly  one  for  8,870  persons.  Most  physicians 
were  concentrated  in  urban  areas  in  the  North,  as  were  the  major  hos¬ 
pitals,  including  those  specializing  in  the  treatment  of  tuberculosis, 
eye  disorders,  and  mental  illness.  In  1976  there  were  2,500  medical 
assistants  working  in  Sudan,  who  helped  ease  the  shortage  of  certified 
physicians.  As  of  1982,  there  were  12,800  nurses  and  7,000  midwives 
working  in  the  country,  concentrated  mostly  in  the  North. 

These  numbers  had  improved  significantly  by  the  early  2000s.  The 
Ministry  of  Health’s  estimate  was  that  8,800  physicians  served  Sudan 
in  2006,  almost  doubling  the  number  of 4,500  in  1998.  The  ratio  of  phy¬ 
sicians  per  100,000  people  was  28.6,  compared  with  27  per  100,000  in 
Nigeria  and  222  per  100,000  in  Egypt  (as  of  2004).  Ministry  of  Health 
statistics  also  revealed  that  women  made  up  more  than  half  of  the  coun¬ 
try’s  doctors  and  that  the  ratio  of  doctors  working  in  urban  areas  versus 
those  in  rural  areas  was  more  than  two  to  one. 

According  to  the  federal  Ministry  of  Health’s  latest  figures,  in  2008 
Sudan  had  395  hospitals  with  a  total  of  more  than  28,000  beds,  up  from 
285  hospitals  with  23,000  beds  in  1998,  roughly  one  hospital  and  73 
beds  per  100,000  people.  Health  centers  numbered  1,400  and  primary 
health-care  units,  2,000.  Excluding  the  South,  there  were  more  than 
8,600  physicians,  460  dentists,  and  800  phannacists.  Private  health  facil¬ 
ities  were  in  addition  to  these  state  facilities.  All  professional  medical 
personnel  were  prone  to  leave  the  country  once  their  training  was  com¬ 
plete.  The  Sudanese  government  had  not  released  figures  on  health 
expenditures  in  recent  years,  but  while  statistics  varied,  WHO  cited  a  fig¬ 
ure  of  3.6  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  for  2008,  or  US$  1 8  per  cap¬ 
ita;  for  2006,  WHO  statistics  gave  the  Ministry  of  Health  budget  as  6.3 
percent  of  the  government  budget.

Considering  the  state  of  health  care  throughout  the  country,  Sudan 
has  a  surprisingly  well-developed  medical  education  system.  The 
nation  has  produced  many  of  its  own  health-care  workers.  Sudan’s  first 
medical  school  opened  in  1918.  There  were  25  medical  schools  training 
doctors  in  Sudan  in  2005.  More  than  40  other  schools  educated  students 
in  health-related  fields.  These  schools  graduated  1,400  doctors  annually 
and  many  more  health  professionals.  Retention  of  well-qualified  doc¬ 
tors,  however,  was  predictably  difficult.  The  Sudanese  Medical  Council 
reported  in  2005  that  of  the  2 1 ,000  doctors  registered  with  their  organi¬ 
zation,  nearly  60  percent  practiced  outside  the  country  and  that  on  aver¬ 
age  some  800  doctors  left  the  country  each  year  for  Saudi  Arabia, 
Britain,  and  other  destinations. 

Overall,  the  health  infrastructure  and  number  of  doctors  serving  the 
Sudanese  population  in  the  early  2000s  remained  far  below  even  mini¬ 
mal  accepted  standards.  Improvements  since  the  1980s  were  stunted, 
mainly  by  war.  Even  in  the  North,  where  hospitals  and  doctors  were 
concentrated,  up  to  a  third  of  all  facilities  did  not  meet  accepted  stan¬ 
dards  of  medical  practice.  According  to  WHO,  almost  all  public  finance 
for  health  care  went  toward  hospitals  in  urban  areas.  Thus,  in  most  rural 
areas  of  the  country,  particularly  in  the  South,  residents  often  had  to 
travel  significant  distances  to  reach  the  nearest  health  facility.  Even  with 


135 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


the  efforts  of  international  NGOs  in  the  South,  the  WHO  estimated  that 
only  25  percent  of  Southerners  had  access  to  health  care,  a  lower  esti¬ 
mate  than  some  others. 

Diseases 

Sudan  has  a  high  incidence  of  debilitating  and  sometimes  fatal  dis¬ 
eases,  the  persistence  of  which  reflects  difficult  ecological  conditions, 
high  levels  of  malnutrition,  an  inadequate  health-care  system,  and  con¬ 
flict  and  violence.  Malaria  is  the  leading  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortal¬ 
ity  in  Sudan,  and  the  entire  population  is  at  risk.  This  plague,  controlled 
throughout  much  of  the  rest  of  the  world,  commands  an  inordinate 
amount  of  Sudan’s  limited  medical  expertise.  In  2003  hospitals  reported 
3  million  cases;  malaria  victims  accounted  for  up  to  40  percent  of  outpa¬ 
tient  consultations  and  30  percent  of  all  hospital  admissions.  In  Darfur 
alone  in  2005,  doctors  reported  227,550  cases;  doctors,  however,  did 
report  greater  success  in  saving  patients  than  in  past  years. 

Poor  sanitation  and  inadequate  health  care  explain  the  presence  of 
many  other  communicable  diseases.  Acute  respiratory  infections,  hepati¬ 
tis  E,  measles,  meningitis,  typhoid,  and  tuberculosis  are  all  major  causes 
of  illness  and  mortality.  More  restricted  geographically  but  affecting  sub¬ 
stantial  portions  of  the  population  in  the  areas  of  occurrence  are  schisto¬ 
somiasis  (snail  fever),  found  in  the  White  Nile  and  Blue  Nile  areas  and  in 
irrigated  zones  between  the  two  Niles,  and  trypanosomiasis  (sleeping 
sickness),  which  was  originally  limited  to  the  Southern  borderlands  but 
began  spreading  rapidly  in  the  1 980s  in  the  forested  regions  of  South 
Sudan.  A  number  of  tropical  diseases  formerly  under  control  have  resur¬ 
faced  in  the  South  because  of  the  breakdown  of  the  health-care  system, 
including  leprosy,  elephantiasis,  river  blindness,  cholera,  and  guinea 
worm. 

A  lack  of  safe  water  means  that  nearly  45  percent  of  children  suffer 
from  diarrhea,  which  leads  to  poor  health  and  weak  immune  systems. 
Vaccination  campaigns  have  largely  eradicated  polio  from  the  coun¬ 
try;  in  2005  alone,  more  than  6  million  children  under  the  age  of  five 
were  vaccinated.  Although  in  2004  a  small  outbreak  led  to  126  con¬ 
firmed  cases,  the  following  year  the  number  dropped  to  18. 

The  years  of  conflict  and  difficulties  in  collecting  data  make  it  diffi¬ 
cult  to  summarize  Sudan’s  experience  of  HIV/AIDS.  Nonetheless, 
according  to  the  United  Nations,  in  2009  an  estimated  260,000  Suda¬ 
nese  were  living  with  HIV,  and  12,000  had  died.  The  HIV  prevalence 
rate  among  adults  aged  1 5^19  was  estimated  at  1 . 1  percent,  a  relatively 
low  rate  compared  with  neighboring  countries.  UN  officials  suspected 
that  South  Sudan  had  a  significant  HIV  problem  because  in  2010  more 
than  1  percent  of  pregnant  women  using  antenatal  services  were  living

with  HIV.  Sudanese  officials  in  2007  estimated  prevalence  rates  in  the 
South  at  3.1  percent,  or  155,000  adults,  as  a  result  of  civil  war,  conflict 
in  the  East  along  the  border  with  Ethiopia  and  Eritrea,  and  traffic  along 
trucking  routes  serving  major  port  areas.  Prevalence  was  also  thought 
to  be  higher  than  the  overall  estimates  for  the  North  in  Khartoum, 
where  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  had  migrated  to  escape  civil 
war.  The  use  of  unsterile  syringes  and  untested  blood  by  health  workers 
has  contributed  to  the  spread  of  the  disease  among  displaced  peoples. 

As  recently  as  1998,  the  Sudanese  government  denied  that  HIV/ 
AIDS  posed  any  significant  health  threat  to  its  citizenry.  Only  in  2004 
did  the  government  reverse  its  policy  and  officially  begin  planning  to 
address  the  problem.  As  of  2007,  both  Northern  and  Southern  govern¬ 
ments  were  developing  policies  to  curb  future  cases  and  to  treat  those 
already  infected.  The  minister  of  health  in  the  North  noted  problems 
with  the  use  of  condoms  as  a  preventive  measure,  and  religious  lead¬ 
ers  were  reluctant  to  discuss  prevention  methods  beyond  abstinence 
and  monogamous  marriage.  Not  surprisingly,  knowledge  about  HIV/ 
AIDS  is  limited,  particularly  in  the  South.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


All  country  studies  of  Sudan,  whether  by  historians  or  social  scien¬ 
tists,  contain  some  background  on  geography  and  society.  Standard  clas¬ 
sics  include  Robert  O.  Collins’s  Shadows  in  the  Grass:  Britain  in  the 
Southern  Sudan,  1918-1956 ;  Martin  Daly’s  Empire  on  the  Nile:  The 
Anglo-Egyptian  Sudan,  1898-1934 ;  and  Peter  Holt’s  A  Modern  History 
of  the  Sudan:  From  the  Funj  Sultanate  to  the  Present  Day: ;  the  latter  two 
authors’  combined  A  History  of  the  Sudan:  From  the  Coming  of  Islam  to 
the  Present  Day ;  Tim  Niblock’s  Class  and  Power  in  Sudan:  The  Dynam¬ 
ics  of  Sudanese  Politics,  1898-1 98 5;  Peter  Woodward’s  Sudan  1898- 
1989:  The  Unstable  State ;  Peter  Bechtold’s  Politics  in  the  Sudan:  Par¬ 
liamentary  and  Military  Rule  in  an  Emerging  African  Nation ;  and  John 
VoIPs  Sudan:  State  and  Society  in  Crisis.  Richard  Lobban  Jr.,  Robert  S. 
Kramer,  and  Carolyn  Fluehr-Lobban’s  Historical  Dictionary  of  the 
Sudan ,  contains  much  useful  information  about  geography  and  society. 

Aside  from  general  studies,  a  significant  number  of  books  and  articles 
focus  on  the  lengthy  conflict  between  Southern  groups  and  the  central 
(and  Northern-dominated)  government.  The  following  works  contain  a 
great  deal  of  useful  information  about  geography  and  ethnography,  albeit 
mostly  of  the  Southern  region  and  often  from  a  pro-Southem  perspec¬ 
tive.  Leading  references  would  be  Abel  Alier’s  Southern  Sudan:  Too 
Many  Agreements  Dishonoured ;  Mohammad  Omar  Beshir’s  The  South¬ 
ern  Sudan:  From  Conflict  to  Peace ;  Francis  Deng’s  classic,  Dynamics  of

Kampalas  and  former  U.S.  Ambassador  Donald  Petterson’s  memoir, 
Inside  Sudan:  Political  Islam,  Conflict,  and  Catastrophe. 

As  a  description  of  the  physical  geography  of  Sudan,  K.  M.  Barbour’s 
The  Republic  of  the  Sudan:  A  Regional  Geography  remains  the  standard 
work,  supplemented  by  J.  M.  G.  Lebon’s  Land  Use  in  the  Sudan. 
Because  the  Nile  is  crucial  to  Sudan,  it  has  been  extensively  studied,  pro¬ 
ducing  such  standards  as  Robert  O.  Collins’s  The  Waters  of  the  Nile: 
Hydropolitics  and  the  Jonglei  Canal,  1900-1988,  as  well  as  John  Water- 
bury’s  Hydropolitics  of  the  Nile  Valley  and  his  more  recent  The  Nile 
Basin:  National  Determinants  of  Collective  Action. 

Outstanding  works  that  focus  on  specific  ethnic  groups  or  regions 
include  Gerard  Pmnier’s  Darfur:  The  Ambiguous  Genocides  Alex  de

The  best  works  on  the  Nuer  are  Douglas  Johnson’s  Nuer  Prophets:  A

All  studies  of  Islam  in  Sudan  owe  a  debt  to  John  Spencer  Triming- 
ham’s  seminal  work  of  that  name.  Gabriel  Warburg’s  Islam,  Sectarian¬ 
ism,  and  Politics  in  Sudan  since  the  Mahdiyyah  traces  the  connection  to 
politics,  as  do  the  more  specialized  Islamic  Law  and  Society  in  the  Sudan 
by  Carolyn  Fluehr-Lobban  and  Abdelwahhab  El-Affendi’s  Turabis 
Revolution:  Islam  and  Power  in  Sudan ,  to  be  read  in  conjunction  with 
Mahmoud  Mohammed  Taha’s  The  Second  Message  of  Islam.  Informa¬ 
tion  on  religion  in  the  South  is  in  Oliver  Albino’s  The  Sudan:  A  Southern

Chapter  3.  The  Economy 


< 


A  cattl 


THE  ECONOMY  OF  SUDAN  was  at  a  turning  point  in  the  early  decades 
of  the  twenty-first  century.  In  January  2005,  the  signing  of  a  peace  treaty 
between  the  government  and  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement/ 
Army  (SPLM/A)  brought  to  an  end  more  than  20  years  of  conflict.  The 
country  had  been  tom  apart  by  a  costly  civil  war,  economic  mismanage¬ 
ment,  an  influx  of  refugees  from  neighboring  countries  as  well  as  internal 
migration,  and  recurrent  drought,  especially  in  the  West  and  South,  with 
the  concomitant  failure  of  staple  food  and  cash  crops.  With  the  prospect  of 
peace,  the  country  anticipated  the  possibility  of  reinvigorating  its  economy 
based  on  the  development  of  its  wealth  of  human  and  natural  resources. 

In  the  1970s,  economic  growth  had  been  stimulated  by  a  large  influx 
of  capital  from  Saudi  Arabia  and  Kuwait,  invested  with  the  expectation 
that  Sudan  would  become  the  breadbasket  of  the  Arab  world,  by  large 
increments  of  foreign  aid  from  the  United  States  and  the  European  Eco¬ 
nomic  Community,  by  loans  from  the  World  Bank,  and  by  generous  con¬ 
tributions  from  other  countries.  Sudan’s  greatest  economic  resource  was 
its  agriculture,  to  be  developed  in  the  vast  arable  land  that  either  received 
sufficient  rainfall  or  could  be  irrigated  from  the  Nile  River.  Its  economic 
future  became  much  brighter  with  the  discovery  of  oil. 

In  the  1 980s,  however,  Sudan  underwent  severe  political  and  economic 
upheavals.  The  civil  war  in  the  South  resumed  in  1983.  There  was  a  dearth 
of  rainfall  in  the  usually  productive  regions  of  the  Sahel  (see  Glossary) 
and  southern  Sudan.  Refugees  flowed  into  the  country  from  Eritrea,  Ethi¬ 
opia,  Uganda,  and  Chad,  and  internal  migration  as  a  result  of  the  civil  war 
further  strained  the  Sudanese  budget.  In  1 989  Colonel  (later  Lieutenant 
General)  Umar  Hassan  Ahmed  al-Bashir  led  a  military  coup  that  over¬ 
threw  the  government.  Under  al-Bashir’s  administration,  Sudan  became 
economically,  if  not  politically,  isolated  from  the  world  community.  Brit¬ 
ain  cut  its  economic  aid  in  1991.  The  United  States  ended  economic  aid, 
although  not  humanitarian  aid,  in  1994,  suspended  its  diplomatic  presence 
in  1 996,  and  applied  sanctions  for  sponsorship  of  terrorism  and  human- 
rights  abuses  in  1997. 

Sudan  accmed  an  increasing  debt  burden  over  the  years.  By  the  early 
1990s,  it  was  unable  to  service  its  debt.  The  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF)  adopted  a  “Declaration  of  Non-Cooperation,”  and  the  World  Bank 
closed  its  Khartoum  office.  In  1997,  however,  Sudan  developed  an  eco¬ 
nomic  reform  plan  to  reestablish  long-term  growth  and  initiated  debt-service 
payments.  By  1999,  as  Sudan  began  to  export  petroleum  and  petroleum 
products,  economic  growth  had  reached  6.6  percent.  The  IMF  removed  its 
Declaration  of  Non-Cooperation,  and  the  World  Bank  reopened  its  office.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


In  January  2005,  the  SPLA  and  the  Sudanese  government  signed  a 
peace  agreement  that  allowed  the  country  to  consider  the  economic  divi¬ 
dend  that  peace  might  provide.  Various  countries  and  international  orga¬ 
nizations  pledged  to  help  Sudan  recover  from  the  civil  war,  although 
continued  conflict  and  genocide  in  the  Darfur  region  have  so  far  pre¬ 
vented  the  recovery  and  restricted  the  type  of  foreign  aid  provided.  The 
results  of  the  referendum  in  January  2011,  which  led  to  independence  for 
South  Sudan,  will,  needless  to  say,  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  econ¬ 
omies  of  both  North  and  South. 

Historical  Development 

The  Colonial  Period 

The  colonial  government  was  not  interested  in  balanced  economic 
growth.  Instead,  it  concentrated  its  development  efforts  on  irrigated 
agriculture  and  the  railroad  system  throughout  the  Anglo-Egyptian 
Condominium  (1899-1955).  Incidental  government  investment  went 
mainly  into  ad  hoc  projects,  such  as  the  construction  of  cotton  gins  and 
oilseed-pressing  mills,  as  adjuncts  of  the  irrigation  program.  A  limited 
amount  of  rain-fed  mechanized  farming  was  also  initiated  during 
World  War  II.  After  the  war,  two  development  programs — actually  lists 
of  proposed  investments — were  drawn  up  for  the  periods  1946-50  and 
1951-55.  These  plans  appear  to  have  been  a  belated  effort  to  broaden 
the  country's  economic  base  in  preparation  for  eventual  Sudanese  inde¬ 
pendence.  Both  programs  were  seriously  hampered  by  a  lack  of  experi¬ 
enced  personnel  and  materials  and  had  little  real  impact.  Independently, 
the  private  sector  expanded  irrigated  agriculture,  and  some  small  manu¬ 
facturing  operations  were  started,  but  only  three  larger  industrial  enter¬ 
prises  (a  meat-processing  plant,  a  cement  plant,  and  a  brewery)  were 
constructed,  all  between  1949  and  1952.  The  newly  independent 
Sudan’s  principal  development  inheritance  in  1956  thus  was  the  vast 
irrigated  Gezira  Scheme  and  Sudan  Railways. 

The  Postcolonial  Period 

The  new  government  did  not  attempt  to  prepare  a  national  develop¬ 
ment  plan  until  1960.  A  Ten- Year  Plan  of  Economic  and  Social  Devel¬ 
opment  for  the  fiscal  years  (FY — see  Glossary)  1 961-70  was  drawn  up 
for  SDP565  million  (for  value  of  the  Sudanese  pound — see  Glossary), 
at  the  time  equivalent  to  more  than  US$1 .6  billion.  The  private  sector 
was  expected  to  provide  40  percent  of  the  amount.  Unfortunately,  the 
government  had  few  experienced  planners,  and  goals  were  overly 
ambitious.  The  plan  as  prepared  was  not  adhered  to.  Implementation 
was  by  investment  programs  that  were  drawn  up  annually,  and  projects 


144 


The  Economy 


not  in  the  original  plan  were  frequently  included.  Investment  was  at  a 
high  rate  in  the  first  years,  so  that  a  number  of  major  undertakings  were 
completed  by  midplan,  including  the  Khashm  al-Qirbah  and  Manaqil 
irrigation  projects  and  the  Roseires  Dam. 

As  the  1 960s  progressed,  a  lack  of  funds  threatened  the  continuation  of 
development  activities.  Government  current  expenditure  had  increased 
much  faster  than  receipts,  in  part  because  of  the  intensification  of  the  civil 
war  in  the  South.  At  the  same  time,  there  was  a  shortfall  in  foreign  invest¬ 
ment  capital.  The  substantial  foreign  reserves  held  at  the  beginning  of  the 
plan  period  were  depleted,  and  the  government  resorted  to  deficit  financing 
and  foreign  borrowing.  By  1 967,  the  Ten- Year  Plan  had  been  abandoned. 

Late  in  the  1960s,  the  government  prepared  a  new  plan  covering  FY 
1968  to  FY  1972.  That  plan  was  discarded  after  the  military  coup  led  by 
Colonel  Ja’far  al-Numayri  (in  power,  1969-85)  in  May  1969.  Instead,  the 
government  adopted  the  Five-Year  Plan  of  Economic  and  Social  Develop¬ 
ment  (1970-74).  That  plan,  which  was  prepared  with  the  assistance  of 
Soviet  planning  personnel,  emphasized  socialist  development.  After  the 
end  of  the  first  civil  war  in  the  South,  in  1973  the  government  established 
the  Interim  Action  Program,  which  extended  the  original  plan  period 
through  FY  1976.  New  objectives  included  the  removal  of  transportation 
bottlenecks,  attainment  of  self-sufficiency  in  the  production  of  several 
agricultural  and  industrial  consumer  items,  and  an  increase  in  agricultural 
exports.  Investment  during  the  first  five  years  was  considerably  above  the 
original  plan  projection;  however,  the  plan  failed  to  achieve  its  goal  of  a 
7.6  percent  annual  growth  rate  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see 
Glossary),  so  it  was  extended  to  1977.  During  the  years  of  the  Interim 
Action  Program,  the  government  initiated  several  irrigation  projects,  estab¬ 
lished  factories  on  the  Nile  northeast  of  Khartoum  and  on  the  White  Nile 
south  of  Khartoum,  paved  the  roads  between  Khartoum  and  Port  Sudan, 
and  began  excavation  in  the  South  for  the  Jonglei  Canal  (see  Glossary), 
also  seen  as  Junqali  Canal. 

In  early  1977,  the  government  published  the  Six- Year  Plan  of  Economic 
and  Social  Development,  1977-82.  The  plan  goals  and  projections  also 
appeared  optimistic  because  of  the  worsening  domestic  economic  situation, 
marked  by  growing  inflation.  The  inflation  stemmed  in  large  part  from  def¬ 
icit  development  financing  (printing  money),  increasing  development  costs 
because  of  worldwide  price  rises,  and  rising  costs  for  external  capital.  Dur¬ 
ing  the  plan's  second  year,  FY  1978,  there  was  no  economic  growth,  exter¬ 
nal  debt  pressures  increased,  and  Sudan  failed  to  meet  its  scheduled 
payments.  The  result  was  an  abandonment  of  Six- Year  Plan  projections,  a 
restriction  of  expenditures  generally  to  the  completion  of  projects  under 
way,  elimination  of  transport  constraints,  and  a  series  of  short-term  “roll¬ 
ing”  programs  that  emphasized  exports. 


145 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


In  October  1983,  the  government  announced  a  three-year  public  invest¬ 
ment  program,  but  efforts  to  Islamize  the  economy  in  1984  impeded  its 
implementation.  Between  1978  and  1985,  agricultural  and  industrial  pro¬ 
duction  declined  in  per-capita  terms,  and  imports  during  much  of  the  1 980s 
were  three  times  the  level  of  exports.  After  the  al-Numayri  government 
was  overthrown  in  April  1985,  the  investment  program  was  suspended. 

An  economic  recovery  program  began  in  August  1987.  This  program 
was  followed,  beginning  in  October  1988,  by  a  three-year  recovery  pro¬ 
gram  to  reform  trade  policy  and  regulate  the  exchange  rate,  reduce  sub¬ 
sidies  and  the  budget  deficit,  and  encourage  exports  and  privatization. 
The  military  government  of  Colonel  Umar  al-Bashir  that  took  office  on 
June  30,  1989,  offered  little  possibility  for  early  economic  recovery.  For¬ 
eign  business  interests  viewed  the  government’ s  policies  to  Islamize  the 
banking  system  as  a  disincentive  to  do  business  in  Sudan  because  no 
interest  would  be  paid  on  new  loans.  Finally,  the  government  did  not  sat¬ 
isfy  the  IMF  or  other  major  creditors  that  it  had  reduced  subsidies  on 
basic  commodities  enough  to  reduce  its  budget  deficit.  By  1991  the 
value  of  the  Sudanese  pound  against  the  U.S.  dollar  had  sunk  to  less 
than  10  percent  of  its  1978  value,  and  the  country’s  external  debt  had 
risen  to  US$13  billion,  the  interest  on  which  could  be  paid  only  by  rais¬ 
ing  new  loans. 

Two  reasons  for  the  decline  in  production  were  the  droughts  and 
accompanying  famine  occurring  in  1980-91,  and  the  influx  of  more  than 
1  million  refugees  from  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  Chad,  and  Uganda,  in  addition 
to  the  persons  displaced  by  the  warfare  in  the  South,  which  had  resumed 
in  1983,  who  were  estimated  to  number  between  1.5  million  and  3.5  mil¬ 
lion.  Nevertheless,  the  decline  in  Sudan's  agricultural  and  industrial  pro¬ 
duction  had  begun  before  these  calamities.  Few  development  projects 
were  completed  on  time,  and  those  that  were  completed  failed  to  achieve 
projected  production.  Sudan  found  itself  in  a  cycle  of  increasing  debt 
and  declining  production. 

Sudan  borrowed  heavily  for  its  development  programs  over  the 
years;  then  it  suffered  severely  as  international  interest  rates  increased. 
During  the  1990s,  Sudan's  relationship  with  the  IMF  became  increas¬ 
ingly  strained  as  a  result  of  continuing  debt  arrears  dating  back  to  1984. 
In  1997,  when  the  IMF  threatened  to  expel  Sudan  from  the  fund,  the 
government  revised  its  economic  policies  and  established  a  comprehen¬ 
sive  economic  reform  and  structural  adjustment  program  with  the  assis¬ 
tance  of  the  IMF.  The  program,  which  continued,  sought  to  stabilize  the 
macroeconomic  environment,  reduce  the  rate  of  inflation,  strengthen  the 
external  accounts,  increase  growth  through  privatization  and  deregula¬ 
tion,  refonn  the  banking  sector,  liberalize  trade,  and  revise  investment 
and  foreign-exchange  controls. 


146 


The  Economy 


Although  some  aspects  of  the  program,  including  privatization,  have 
been  disappointing,  the  IMF  has  praised  the  government  for  its  adher¬ 
ence  to  the  reform  agenda.  The  IMF  lifted  its  “non-cooperation”  order  in 
1999  and  restored  Sudan's  voting  rights  in  2000.  The  reform  program 
has  been  credited  with  significant  improvements  in  the  economy.  Infla¬ 
tion  fell  from  triple  digits  to  hover  around  10  percent,  the  currency  stabi¬ 
lized,  foreign  investment  rose,  and  there  were  several  years  of  economic 
growth.  Nevertheless,  there  were  still  many  problems  to  overcome, 
especially  the  impact  of  the  previous  civil  war  and  the  conflict  in  Darfur, 
which  continued  to  place  a  heavy  burden  on  government  finances  and 
undermine  investor  confidence,  and  the  external  debt  arrears,  which  hin¬ 
dered  access  to  new  foreign  funding.  The  impending  secession  of  South 
Sudan  would  also  probably  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  economy. 

Structure  of  the  Economy 

Overview  of  the  Economy 

Information  about  the  economy  was  based  on  official  figures  from 
the  National  Accounts,  which  might  not  be  complete,  however,  because 
the  civil  war  previously  made  certain  areas  inaccessible  for  statistical 
surveys.  Thus,  the  main  rural  areas  in  the  South  were  probably  not 
included  in  the  National  Accounts  from  the  mid-1990s  to  the  end  of  the 
war,  because  it  was  impossible  for  the  government  to  collect  data  in 
large  areas  that  were  controlled  by  the  SPLM/A.  Although  a  National 
Household  Survey  was  conducted  in  2009,  the  prior  survey,  which  influ¬ 
enced  the  consumer  price  index  for  many  years,  was  made  in  1978,  the 
previous  weights  for  the  consumer  price  index  were  based  on  that  earlier 
household  survey,  and  comparisons  of  the  prices  of  goods  and  services 
had  not  been  updated  for  many  years.  Moreover,  information  for  the 
previous  price  index  was  gathered  only  for  Khartoum.  Although  the 
Fifth  Population  and  Housing  Census  was  carried  out  in  2008,  the  previ¬ 
ous  one  was  made  in  1993,  and  it  was  based  partly  on  estimates  because 
of  limited  access  in  the  South,  again  making  comparisons  unrealistic. 
Similarly,  estimates  of  the  real  value  of  production  and  GDP  may  not  be 
accurate  because  of  limited  coverage.  There  had  been  no  complete  col¬ 
lection  or  analysis  of  data  on  the  agricultural  sector,  which  is  very 
important  in  Sudan,  since  1968.  Thus,  claims  about  the  economy  were 
probably  not  completely  reliable. 

Sudan  is  a  poor  country  despite  its  considerable  natural  resources. 
Economic  mismanagement  and  the  disruption  of  years  of  civil  war 
prevented  economic  development  for  many  years.  Agriculture  is  the 
most  important  sector  of  the  economy,  but  the  civil  war  interfered  with 
it,  causing  farmers  to  leave  their  land  and  disrupting  the  flow  of  inputs 


147

and  the  marketing  of  products  (see  Agriculture,  Livestock,  Fisheries, 
and  Forestry,  this  eh.).  The  poor  road  system  and  transport  facilities 
also  hindered  distribution  throughout  the  country  (see  Transportation 
and  Telecommunications,  this  eh.). 

Cotton  was  the  leading  cash  crop  in  the  past,  much  of  it  grown  on 
the  huge  Al-Gezira  irrigation  project  south  of  Khartoum.  Production 
declined  in  recent  years,  largely  as  a  result  of  low  international  prices. 
Sesame  displaced  cotton  in  1 996  as  the  leading  revenue  earner  among 
agricultural  exports.  Livestock  was  the  fastest-growing  non-oil  sector 
from  2002. 

Although  agriculture  remains  important,  the  development  of  the  oil 
industry  changed  the  structure  of  the  economy  (see  Petroleum,  this  eh.). 
An  oil-export  pipeline  from  the  Southern  oil  fields  to  the  Red  Sea 
opened  in  August  1999,  and  production  rose  to  an  average  of  280,000 
barrels  per  day  (b/d)  in  2003.  An  expansion  of  the  pipeline  capacity 
allowed  output  to  increase  to  an  estimated  480,000  b/d  in  2010.  Oil- 
industry  development  increased  foreign  investment  in  the  industrial  sec¬ 
tor,  making  petroleum  and  related  products  the  most  important  export 
commodity,  earning  an  estimated  95  percent  of  export  revenue  in  2008. 
It  ended  Sudan’s  dependency  on  imported  petroleum  products,  increased 
the  country’s  foreign-exchange  earnings,  and  improved  the  balance  of 
payments. 

Sudan’s  dependence  on  imports  for  much  of  its  capital  equipment 
and  petroleum  and  its  low  export  earnings,  until  oil  exports  began  in 
1999,  led  to  trade  deficits  and  a  large  international  debt.  In  1997  Sudan 
put  in  place  an  economic  reform  plan  and  worked  with  the  IMF  to 
reduce  its  debt  and  increase  economic  growth.  The  end  of  the  civil  war 
and  the  conclusion  of  the  peace  agreement  of  2005  led  Sudan  to  antici¬ 
pate  increased  foreign  investment  and  foreign  assistance  that  would  set 
it  on  the  path  to  sustained  economic  development.  However,  violence 
and  displacement  in  Darfur  prevented  that  region  from  benefiting  from 
any  peace  dividend. 

Gross  Domestic  Product 

GDP  at  market  prices  increased  steadily  over  the  years  from  US$12.2 
billion  in  2000  to  US$  27.3  billion  in  2005,  and  an  estimated  US$54.2  bil¬ 
lion  in  2009.  The  preliminary  government  figure  for  2010  was  US$68.44 
billion.  GDP  per  capita  also  increased  steadily  from  US$371  in  2000,  to 
US$706  in  2005,  and  to  an  estimated  $1,281  in  2009. 

Real  growth  of  GDP  (at  constant  1982  prices)  averaged  6  percent  a 
year  after  the  IMF-monitored  economic  reform  program  began  in  1997. 
According  to  foreign  analysts,  it  continued  at  6.3  percent  in  2005.  Growth 
rose  to  1 1 .3  percent  in  2006  before  slowing  to  1 0.2  percent  in  2007,  to  6.6

percent  in  2008,  and  to  4.2  percent  in  2009  as  the  growth  of  the  world 
economy  also  slowed.  The  government’s  own  figures  showed  an  even 
lower  growth  rate  for  2009  of  3  percent  but  projected  an  increase  to  6.9 
percent  for  2010. 

The  primary  sector  of  agriculture  (composed  of  crops,  livestock,  fish¬ 
ing,  and  forestry)  was  always  large,  but  its  contribution  to  GDP  declined 
steadily  over  the  years  as  the  contribution  of  the  secondary  sector  began 
to  grow.  In  2004,  the  estimated  contribution  of  the  primary  sector  to  GDP 
was  35.4  percent,  but  by  20 1 0  its  share  had  declined  to  an  estimated  3 1 .3 
percent.  The  secondary  sector  of  industry,  composed  of  petroleum,  other 
mining  and  quarrying,  manufacturing,  electricity  and  water,  and  con¬ 
struction,  was  the  smallest  in  2004,  contributing  only  26.6  percent  to 
GDP.  By  2008  that  sector  contributed  an  estimated  34.7  percent  to  GDP 
as  a  result  of  the  development  of  the  oil  industry,  but  by  20 1 0  it  had  fallen 
to  a  projected  24.5  percent  as  a  result  of  slower  growth  in  the  petroleum 
sector.  The  tertiary  sector  of  services  contributed  an  estimated  38  percent 
in  2004.  Its  contribution  declined  to  34.2  percent  by  2008  but  was  pro¬ 
jected  at  44.2  percent  in  2010  (see  table  2,  Appendix). 

The  most  recent  figures  available  for  GDP  by  expenditure  were  for 
the  year  2008.  Of  the  major  components,  private  consumption  was  the 
largest  at  52.8  percent,  while  government  consumption  was  13.2  per¬ 
cent.  Investment  totaled  18.2  percent.  Net  exports  (the  value  of  exports 
minus  imports)  were  small,  but  positive,  at  0.6  percent.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Prices  and  Inflation 

During  the  1970s,  the  government  compiled  monthly  data  on  con¬ 
sumer  prices  in  Sudan,  based  on  data  collected  in  the  capital  area's 
three  cities,  Omdurman,  Khartoum,  and  Khartoum  North.  At  the  begin¬ 
ning  of  the  1970s,  annual  price  rises  were  moderate,  between  9  and  10 
percent.  From  1973  onward,  the  inflation  rate  grew  because  of  continu¬ 
ing  worldwide  inflation,  an  increase  in  the  money  supply  resulting 
from  the  central  government's  deficit  financing  and  from  borrowing  by 
state  corporations,  shortages  of  consumer  goods,  problems  of  supply 
caused  by  transport  deficiencies,  and  increased  private-sector  borrow¬ 
ing.  By  1989  prices  were  increasing  by  74  percent  annually. 

Inflationary  pressures  continued  into  the  1990s.  Prices  increased  by 
more  than  100  percent  a  year  during  1991-94,  with  the  rate  reaching  a 
high  of  130  percent  in  1996.  Implementation  of  the  IMF  refonn  program 
in  1997,  along  with  monetary  reforms  of  the  central  bank  and  declining 
prices  of  imported  non-oil  commodities  and  manufactured  goods, 
slowed  inflation  to  less  than  47  percent  in  that  year,  less  than  20  percent 
in  1998  and  1999,  and  to  single  digits  by  2000.  Inflation  was  7.2  percent 
in  2006.  Although  other  countries  in  the  region  experienced  recession- 
led  declines  in  inflation  in  2009,  a  surge  in  prices  in  the  final  months  of 
that  year  pushed  the  rate  of  inflation  in  Sudan  to  an  annual  average  of 
1 1 .2  percent  and  to  13  percent  in  2010. 

Privatization 

Some  privately  managed  projects  in  irrigation,  water,  and  electricity 
supply  were  turned  over  to  state  management  and  control  soon  after 
independence.  In  the  1970s,  the  public  sector  continued  to  expand  with 
the  nationalization,  confiscation,  and  “Sudanization”  program.  Many  of 
the  state-owned  enterprises  were  poorly  managed,  however,  and  eventu¬ 
ally  became  a  financial  burden  on  the  economy,  requiring  budgetary 
subsidies  and  loans  from  the  Bank  of  Sudan,  guaranteed  by  the  govern¬ 
ment.  To  reduce  the  drain  on  public  finances,  to  fund  infrastructure- 
development  projects  that  were  beyond  the  capacity  of  government 
resources,  and  to  support  growth  in  general,  the  government  reversed  its 
policy,  By  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  it  began  to  encourage  local  and 
foreign  investment  in  sectors  of  the  economy  that  previously  were 
reserved  for  the  state  and  to  privatize  state-owned  enterprises. 

The  Public  Sector  Enterprises  Disposition  Bill  of  1990  and  the  Priva¬ 
tisation  of  State  Corporations  Act  of  1992  selected  190  public  corpora¬ 
tions  for  sale.  Some  72  enterprises  were  disposed  of  in  various  ways, 
including  by  liquidation.  By  2002,  however,  fewer  than  20  of  the  enter¬ 
prises  had  been  sold  to  the  private  sector.  Negotiations  were  concluded 


150 


The  Economy 


for  the  sale  of  the  Real  Estate  Bank,  Atbarah  Cement  Factory,  Friend¬ 
ship  Hotel,  General  Foundation  for  Printing  Publications  and  Adver¬ 
tisement,  Sudan  Duty  Free  Zone  Company,  and  Bridges  and  Roads 
Corporation.  Steps  were  also  taken  toward  the  privatization  of  Sudan 
Airways,  but  some  30  large  state-owned  corporations,  including  the 
National  Electricity  Corporation,  public  banks,  transport  corporations, 
large-scale  irrigation  entities,  and  manufacturing  industries,  remained  to 
be  privatized. 

There  were  some  successes  in  the  privatization  process,  such  as  the 
formation  of  the  Sudan  Telecommunications  Company  (SudaTel), 
which  began  as  a  joint  public-private  company  in  1994.  SudaTel  over¬ 
saw  the  growth  of  both  the  land-line  and  mobile  telephone  (Mobitel) 
networks,  and  attracted  investment  from  both  domestic  and  foreign 
sources.  In  addition  to  Mobitel,  the  Bank  of  Khartoum,  the  Real  Estate 
Bank,  and  the  River  Transport  Corporation  were  sold  in  recent  years, 
and  the  Sudan  Shipping  Line  and  Sudan  Railways  might  be  sold  in  the 
future.  Private  operators  already  provided  passenger  services  on  the 
railroad.  In  2010,  the  government  announced  that  it  intended  to  priva¬ 
tize  all  the  companies  that  it  owned,  starting  in  201 1 . 

Implementation  of  privatization  was  constrained  by  numerous  factors, 
including  the  uncertainties  of  the  war,  the  economic  sanctions  imposed 
by  the  United  States  since  1997,  which  isolated  the  country  from  interna¬ 
tional  money  markets,  the  compensation  costs  of  affected  workers,  and 
the  limited  market  of  buyers.  The  dearth  of  technical  expertise  among 
senior  officials  who  had  to  oversee  the  complex  process  of  valuing  the 
enterprises  and  managing  the  transactions  was  also  a  crucial  concern. 
Potential  investors  were  unwilling  to  take  on  the  companies’  accumu¬ 
lated  debts  and  were  also  aware  of  the  substantial  investment  that  many 
of  the  companies  would  require  after  years  of  neglect.  Influential  labor 
unions  opposed  privatization,  recognizing  that  there  might  be  job  losses 
if  the  enterprises  were  operated  on  a  profitable  basis.  Officials  were  also 
aware  that  prices  might  rise  if  the  businesses  had  to  generate  profits  with¬ 
out  concessional  funding.  There  were  also  accusations  of  corruption; 
government  officials  allegedly  demanded  payments,  and  senior  members 
of  the  regime  were  reported  to  have  bought  state  assets  at  bargain  prices. 

Foreign  Investment 

Foreign  direct  investment  increased  steadily  after  1990.  Passage  of 
the  Investment  Promotion  Act  in  1990,  with  amendments  in  1993, 
1996,  and  2000,  helped  to  rationalize  cumbersome  financial  procedures, 
offer  incentives  to  private  investors,  and  provide  assurance  of  govern¬ 
ment  support  of  private-sector  development.  The  new  law  and  the 
privatization  program  succeeded  in  attracting  investments  in  various 


151 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


sectors,  especially  oil  and  oil-related  investments,  but  also  in  transporta¬ 
tion,  pharmaceuticals,  and  agro-processing.  The  expectation  was  that, 
provided  that  the  nation’s  division  progressed  peacefully,  investments 
should  increase  in  the  non-extractive  industries  as  well. 

Investment  flows  into  Sudan  have  increased  from  next  to  nothing  in 
1996  (US$400,000)  to  US$3.5  billion  in  2006,  or  10  percent  of  GDP,  one 
of  the  highest  ratios  in  the  region,  before  dropping  back  to  US$2.6  billion 
in  2009,  about  5  percent  of  GDP  (preliminary  figures).  Direct  invest¬ 
ments  increased  substantially  in  1998,  to  US$370.7  million,  when  con¬ 
struction  of  the  oil-export  pipeline,  the  Al-Jayli  refinery,  and  the  Port 
Sudan  terminal  work  began.  With  the  success  of  those  investments  and 
the  implementation  of  the  IMF  refonn  program,  other  sectors  also 
received  significant  inflows.  In  2001  a  Chinese  firm,  Harbin  Power  Engi¬ 
neering  Company,  began  building  the  220-megawatt  gas-fired  power  sta¬ 
tion  near  the  Al-Jayli  refinery,  north  of  Khartoum.  In  late  2004,  the 
government  inaugurated  a  new  2 75 -megawatt  power  plant  outside  Khar¬ 
toum,  constructed  by  a  private  foreign  consortium  led  by  a  Malaysian 
company,  DIT  Power,  which  operated  the  US$200  million  plant  as  an 
independent  power  project  (see  Energy,  this  ch.). 

Many  of  the  investments  were  in  urban  areas,  especially  Khartoum 
and  Port  Sudan.  However,  investments  in  food-processing  industries, 
such  as  sugar  factories,  seemed  likely  to  increase  employment  in  rural 
areas  as  well.  The  successful  expansion  of  the  Kananah  Sugar  Com¬ 
pany,  with  significant  foreign  investment,  attracted  more  companies  to 
the  sector  and  led  to  the  construction  of  the  White  Nile  Sugar  Com¬ 
pany.  Turkish  and  Persian  Gulf  investors  also  examined  opportunities 
for  further  factories  in  Sudan  and  showed  an  interest  in  the  financial 
sector  and  the  telecommunications  industry. 

The  government  concluded  agreements  in  2008  to  enable  access  to 
substantial  agricultural  land  by  Persian  Gulf  firms  and  states,  in  response 
to  high  international  food  prices.  Continuing  this  trend,  the  Egyptian  and 
Sudanese  governments  concluded  a  deal  in  September  2010  to  give 
Egyptian  private-sector  companies  access  to  420,000  hectares  (see  Glos¬ 
sary)  of  Sudanese  farmland  in  the  well-irrigated  Al-Gezira  region  south 
of  Khartoum  to  cultivate  wheat  and  other  cereals  to  feed  Egypt’s  grow¬ 
ing  population. 

The  United  States  initiated  trade  sanctions  against  Sudan  in  1997  and 
expanded  them  in  2006  to  affect  foreign  investment  throughout  Sudan. 
The  sanctions  prohibited  all  transactions  by  U.S.  persons  relating  to  petro¬ 
leum  or  petrochemical  industries  in  Sudan,  including  in  the  South.  In 
addition,  they  prohibited  financial  dealings  of  U.S.  persons  with  Sudan 
(except  for  specified  areas  of  the  country),  including  the  negotiation  of 
any  contract,  including  a  financing  contract,  in  support  of  an  industrial, 
commercial,  public  utility,  or  government  project.

The  Economy 


Areas  in  the  South  that  were  outside  of  the  control  of  the  Government 
of  South  Sudan  (GOSS)  had  not  had  any  foreign  investment  by  2010, 
although  a  company  law  was  submitted  by  the  SPLM  to  encourage 
investment  in  the  area,  and  the  peace  agreement  of  2005  offered  incen¬ 
tives.  The  global  recession,  continued  conflict  in  Darfur,  and  the  uncer¬ 
tainty  of  the  outcome  of  the  2011  referendum  caused  lower  foreign 
direct  investment  throughout  the  country  in  2008-10.  However,  GOSS 
did  make  a  belated  effort  to  increase  foreign  investment  in  the  South  as 
the  referendum  neared. 

Role  of  the  Government 

Development  Planning  and  the  Debt 

The  government  of  Sudan  drew  up  its  first  economic  development 
plan  in  1960,  followed  by  many  others  over  the  succeeding  years.  Budget 
deficits  and  debt-service  obligations  were  relatively  insignificant  in  the 
early  years,  but  from  1974  to  1977,  large-scale  borrowing  occurred  and 
new  commitments  were  made.  As  the  economy  began  to  deteriorate  in 
the  late  1970s,  the  government  began  a  series  of  reform  efforts,  although 
the  first  reforms  covering  1978-84  were  not  fully  implemented. 

In  1978  Sudan  failed  to  meet  all  of  its  debt-service  obligations.  In 
1979  public  and  publicly  guaranteed  long-term  debt  increased  to  more 
than  US$2.5  billion,  requiring  Sudan  to  seek  relief  from  its  creditors,  as  it 
was  apparent  that  once  again  it  would  not  meet  its  obligations.  Acting 
through  the  Paris  Club,  a  group  of  industrialized  creditor  countries  that 
included  the  United  States,  Japan,  and  nine  West  European  states,  Sudan 
rescheduled  an  estimated  US$400  million  to  US$500  million  of  the  debt 
guaranteed  by  Western  export-credit  agencies.  The  agreed  payments 
were  to  be  made  over  a  seven-year  period,  with  an  initial  three-year  grace 
period.  In  1981  Sudan  rescheduled  another  US$600  million  in  loans  and 
interest,  as  its  debt  burden  had  increased  to  US$4  billion.  Despite 
repeated  rescheduling  of  Sudan's  debt  burden,  both  arrears  and  debt-ser¬ 
vice  payments  continued  to  increase. 

Sudan's  economy  steadily  weakened,  as  did  its  relations  with  the  IMF 
and  the  Paris  Club.  In  1989  Sudan  repaid  the  IMF  only  a  token  US$15 
million  and  continued  to  resist  IMF  demands  for  further  economic  aus¬ 
terity  measures.  By  mid- 1990,  total  foreign  debt  had  risen  to  US$13  bil¬ 
lion,  and  debt  arrears  to  the  IMF  totaled  more  than  US$1.1  billion. 

The  IMF  adopted  a  “Declaration  of  Non-Cooperation”  in  September 
1990,  as  a  prelude  to  expulsion  of  Sudan  from  the  fund,  citing  continuing 
problems  with  the  arrears  of  its  external  debt  payments  since  1984.  In 
May  1991,  an  IMF  delegation  arrived  in  Khartoum  for  discussions  with 
the  government.  Despite  declarations  by  the  Sudanese  government  that  it 


153 


Sudan:  A  Country’  Study 


was  determined  to  cooperate  with  international  lending  organizations, 
Sudan  was  declared  ineligible  for  debt  relief  by  the  international  financial 
community  because  of  its  inability  to  service  its  debt.  In  1 993  the  IMF 
withdrew  Sudan’s  voting  rights.  In  1995  the  country  continued  to  strug¬ 
gle  with  a  huge  foreign  debt  as  well  as  with  high  inflation,  a  serious 
shortage  of  foreign  exchange,  and  declining  foreign  aid. 

In  1997  Sudan  put  in  place  an  economic  reform  plan  that  is  credited 
with  reestablishing  long-term  economic  growth.  Following  the  1990 
declaration,  Sudan  began  to  work  with  the  IMF  to  develop  a  compre¬ 
hensive  economic  reform  and  structural  adjustment  program.  The  ini¬ 
tial  structural  reform  agenda  was  implemented  within  the  framework  of 
the  Comprehensive  National  Strategy  (CNS)  for  the  1992-2002  period. 
The  program  included  measures  to  reduce  inflation;  liberalize  trade; 
strengthen  the  country’s  external  accounts  by  removing  import  and 
export  restrictions,  reducing  customs  tariffs,  and  rationalizing  the  tariff 
structure;  reduce  the  size  of  the  public  sector  and  increase  privatization 
and  deregulation;  reform  the  banking  sector;  and  revise  investment  and 
foreign-exchange  controls.  It  removed  price  subsidies  and  eliminated 
trade  and  non-trade  barriers.  The  reform  agenda  was  supported  from 
1997  by  successive  Staff-Monitored  Programs  (SMPs)  of  the  IMF. 

Except  for  a  period  during  2001,  when  Sudan  failed  to  meet  its  obliga¬ 
tions  to  the  IMF  (and  in  return  the  IMF  temporarily  suspended  pay¬ 
ments),  the  country  adhered  to  the  program.  The  IMF  credited  the  reform 
program  with  providing  significant  improvements,  including  a  sharp 
reduction  in  inflation  from  triple  digits  to  around  10  percent,  stabilizing 
the  currency,  bringing  the  budget  closer  to  balance,  increasing  foreign 
investment,  and  generating  substantial  economic  growth.  According  to 
the  National  Accounts,  which  might  not  have  been  very  reliable,  growth 
of  GDP  averaged  3.8  percent  per  annum  during  1 990-95,  but  with  signif¬ 
icant  fluctuations  attributed  to  weather-related  cycles  in  agriculture.  The 
growth  rate  increased  to  an  average  of  6.6  percent  per  annum  during 
1996-2000,  slowed  to  an  average  of  5.6  percent  per  annum  during  2001- 
5,  and  maintained  4.2  percent  in  2009  as  the  world  economy  stmggled. 

External  debt  arrears  remained  a  critical  problem,  but  repayments  and 
adherence  to  the  economic  refonn  program  allowed  the  IMF  to  remove 
the  declaration  in  1999  and  restore  Sudan’s  voting  rights  in  2000.  Sudan 
slowly  reintegrated  into  the  international  financial  community. 

Following  the  signing  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  (CPA) 
on  January  9,  2005,  delegations  of  the  Khartoum  government  and  the 
Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement/Army  (SPLM/A)  launched  a  six- 
year  recovery  and  development  plan,  the  Framework  for  Sustained  Peace, 
Development,  and  Poverty  Eradication  in  Sudan.  The  plan  was  developed 
by  a  Joint  Assessment  Mission  organized  by  the  United  Nations  and  the 


154 


The  Economy 


World  Bank.  Sudan’s  newly  formed  Joint  National  Transition  Team  pre¬ 
sented  the  plan  at  the  first  postwar  international  donors’  conference  in 
Oslo,  Norway,  in  April  2005.  As  part  of  the  peace  agreement,  a  national 
unity  government  agreed  to  divide  Sudan’s  oil  wealth  equally  between 
the  North  and  the  South. 

The  World  Bank  reopened  its  Sudan  office  in  January  2005,  after  an 
absence  of  more  than  10  years,  to  assist  with  the  reconstruction  plan. 
The  bank  originally  expected  to  normalize  relations  within  a  year;  how¬ 
ever,  Sudan  would  have  had  to  reduce  its  debt  to  US$5  billion-US$6 
billion  before  resuming  relations.  The  government  continued  to  pay 
principal  and  interest,  but  the  debt  continued  to  rise  rather  than  decline. 
By  the  end  of  2009,  it  had  reached  US$35.7  billion,  an  amount  that  the 
IMF  described  as  unsustainable.  Although  Sudan  had  substantial  repay¬ 
ment  arrears  to  bilateral  and  multilateral  lenders,  creditors  probably 
refused  to  grant  debt  relief  in  2010-1 1  because  of  concerns  about  inter¬ 
nal  conflict  and  civil-rights  abuses.  Therefore,  the  government  might 
have  attempted  to  finance  infrastructure  projects  and  the  fiscal  deficit  by 
increasing  its  debt  to  Gulf  Arab  countries,  China,  and  India.  Such  credit 
was  difficult  to  obtain,  however,  because  of  stringent  credit  conditions, 
which  continued  throughout  the  world  in  2010-1 1 ,  and  also  because  the 
government  made  a  commitment  to  the  IMF  to  limit  the  amount  of  new 
non-concessional  debt. 

The  government  announced  in  May  2010  that  the  IMF  had  agreed  to 
begin  talks  about  potential  debt  relief,  although  it  might  be  years  before 
any  relief  materialized.  The  government  also  noted  that  while  the  total 
amount  had  grown  by  more  than  25  percent  from  the  2005  level,  the 
actual  debt  was  just  US$15.4  billion,  while  arrears  and  interest  made  up 
the  remaining  US$20.3  billion.  The  government  sought  debt  relief 
under  the  IMF’s  and  World  Bank’s  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Countries 
(HIPC)  initiative  or  an  alternative,  but  it  was  blocked  by  a  combination 
of  its  arrears  to  the  IMF  and  the  objections  of  Western  creditor  govern¬ 
ments  because  of  Sudan’s  conduct  in  the  civil  war  and  the  Darfiir  con¬ 
flict.  When  negotiations  took  place,  eventually,  they  would  have  to 
consider  how  the  debt  would  be  managed  or  divided  when  the  South 
seceded. 

The  Budget 

The  budget  of  Sudan  was  in  deficit  for  many  years,  mainly  as  a  result 
of  extremely  high  defense  expenditures.  Official  figures  indicated  that 
they  were  about  one-quarter  of  total  expenditures,  but  unofficial  esti¬ 
mates  suggested  that  they  ran  as  high  as  half  of  total  spending.  Other 
drains  on  the  budget  were  various  subsidies  and  the  support  of  poorly 
run  state-owned  enterprises.  The  war  and  corruption  also  disrupted  the 


155 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


tax-collection  system.  The  1997  IMF  reform  program,  however,  did 
lead  to  some  improvements.  The  government  managed  to  slow  the 
increase  in  expenditures,  restricting  current  spending  by  holding  down 
public-sector  wage  increases,  cutting  some  subsidies,  and  increasing 
fees  for  education  and  other  services.  The  government  also  managed  to 
increase  revenues  as  a  result  of  both  the  reform  program  and  the  devel¬ 
opment  of  the  oil  sector.  These  measures  permitted  an  increase  in  gov¬ 
ernment  expenditures,  especially  an  increase  in  capital  expenditures.  As 
a  result  of  such  reforms,  the  budget  deficit  declined  from  almost  1 3  per¬ 
cent  of  GDP  in  1990,  to  less  than  1  percent  in  1997.  By  2003,  the  bud¬ 
get  had  a  surplus  of  SDD33.6  billion  (for  value  of  the  Sudanese  dinar — 
see  Glossary),  then  worth  US$0. 1  billion. 

A  short-term  increase  in  the  deficit  occurred  after  the  transition  to 
peace  in  2005.  Under  a  wealth-sharing  agreement  between  the  North  and 
the  South,  the  civil  service  increased  in  size,  and  the  National  Assembly 
also  approved  an  increase  in  civil-service  salaries.  Military  spending  was 
not  expected  to  decrease,  and  the  government  did  not  intend  to  increase 
taxes.  A  deficit  of  SDD1.2  billion  (US$0.5  billion)  occurred  in  2005. 
Oil-export  revenues  increased  from  SDD9.0  billion  (US$3.9  billion)  in 
2005  to  SDG15.4  billion  (US$6.9  billion)  in  2008— SDG  being  the 
abbreviation  for  the  Sudanese  pound,  introduced  as  the  national  currency 
to  replace  the  dinar  in  2005  (see  Currency,  this  ch.).  In  the  same  period, 
total  revenues  increased  from  SDD14.7  billion  (US$6.4  billion)  to 
SDG24.0  billion  (US$10.7  billion),  and  total  expenditures  also  increased 
rapidly  from  SDD15.9  billion  (US$6.9  billion)  in  2005  to  SDG26.5  bil¬ 
lion  (US$1 1.  billion)  in  2008.  Thus,  by  2008,  the  deficit  had  increased  to 
SDG2.4  billion  (US$1.1  billion). 

Foreign  Aid 

Foreign  capital  played  a  major  role  in  Sudan’s  development.  The 
great  reliance  on  it  and  the  general  ease  with  which  it  was  acquired 
were  major  factors  contributing  to  the  severe  financial  problems  that 
beset  the  country  after  the  mid-1970s.  Sudan  obtained  public-sector 
loans  for  development  from  a  wide  range  of  international  agencies  and 
individual  governments.  Until  the  mid-1970s,  the  largest  single  source 
was  the  World  Bank,  including  the  International  Development  Associ¬ 
ation  (IDA)  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC). 

The  Arab  oil-producing  states,  as  their  balance-of-payments  sur¬ 
pluses  grew  in  the  1970s  following  increases  in  world  petroleum 
prices,  also  became  significant  suppliers  of  development  capital 
through  bilateral  loans  and  Arab  international  institutions.  The  largest 
of  the  latter  was  the  Arab  Fund  for  Economic  and  Social  Development 
(AFESD),  through  which  was  proposed  the  1976  program  to  develop 


156 


The  Economy 


Sudan  as  a  breadbasket  for  the  Arab  world.  After  the  mid-1970s,  Saudi 
Arabia,  through  its  Saudi  Fund  for  Development,  became  the  largest 
source  of  investment  capital,  apparently  convinced  that  Sudan’s  devel¬ 
opment  could  complement  its  own,  especially  in  making  up  its  large 
food  deficits.  Unfortunately,  the  ambitious  plans  for  Sudan's  becoming 
the  Arab  world’s  major  food  source  faded  by  the  mid-1980s  as  agricul¬ 
tural  production  declined  sharply. 

In  1977  the  United  States  resumed  economic  (and  military)  aid  to 
Sudan.  This  aid  followed  a  10-year  lapse  beginning  with  a  break  in  dip¬ 
lomatic  relations  between  the  two  countries  in  1967,  with  relations 
restored  in  July  1972.  In  1977  the  United  States  became  concerned  about 
geopolitical  trends  in  the  region,  particularly  potential  Libyan  or  Marxist 
Ethiopian  attempts  to  overthrow  al-Numayri’s  pro- Western  government. 
In  the  five-year  period  1977-81,  U.S.  economic  aid  amounted  to  almost 
US$270  million,  of  which  two-thirds  was  in  the  form  of  grants.  By  1984, 
when  the  United  States  had  become  Sudan's  largest  source  of  foreign 
aid,  the  country’s  worsening  economic  and  political  situation,  particu¬ 
larly  al-Numayri’s  domestic  policies  with  regard  to  the  South  and  the 
imposition  of  sharia  on  society,  caused  the  United  States  to  suspend 
US$194  million  of  aid.  In  1985,  following  al-Numayri's  visit  to  Wash¬ 
ington,  the  United  States  provided  Sudan  with  food  aid,  insecticides,  and 
fertilizers.  After  al-Numayri's  overthrow  in  April  1 985  and  Sudan's  fail¬ 
ure  to  make  repayments  on  loans,  the  United  States  discontinued  non¬ 
food  aid,  which  had  been  administered  by  the  United  States  Agency  for 
International  Development  (USAID).  This  aid  not  only  had  included 
direct  funds  for  projects  and  project  assistance  through  commodity 
imports  (mainly  wheat  under  the  Food  for  Peace  Program),  but  it  also 
had  generated  local  currency  to  support  general  development  activities. 
USAID  continued  providing  humanitarian  relief  assistance  to  distressed 
regions  in  Sudan. 

Britain  also  made  substantial  aid  contributions  to  Sudan.  In  January 
1991,  however,  Britain  suspended  its  development  aid,  which  amounted 
to  US$58  million  in  1989,  while  continuing  humanitarian  aid.  This  pol¬ 
icy  change  was  caused  by  a  number  of  factors,  including  alleged  terrorist 
activities  by  Sudanese  agents  against  Sudanese  expatriates  in  Britain.  In 
addition  to  Britain,  other  countries,  including  France,  Germany,  Norway, 
and  Japan,  provided  significant  economic  or  humanitarian  aid  to  Sudan. 
In  early  1990,  the  Danish  government  cancelled  Sudan’s  outstanding 
debt  totaling  more  than  US$22.9  million. 

Major  financial  assistance  came  from  Arab  countries,  especially 
from  Saudi  Arabia  and  Kuwait.  Economic  cooperation  was  initiated 
with  Libya  in  the  1980s.  Saudi  Arabia's  assistance  after  1980  mainly 
took  the  form  of  balance-of-payments  support  and  petroleum  shipments

rather  than  project  aid.  Sudan’s  support  of  Iraq  in  the  1991  Persian  Gulf 
War  alienated  the  Gulf  states  and  Saudi  Arabia,  which  sharply  curtailed 
their  economic  aid  to  Khartoum.  The  increasingly  close  ties  between 
Sudan  and  Iran  in  the  early  1990s  were  another  factor  in  diminished 
Arab  financial  aid  to  Khartoum. 

Prior  to  the  collapse  of  communist  regimes  in  the  Soviet  Union  and 
Eastern  Europe,  China  had  been  the  most  important  communist  pro¬ 
vider  of  development  funds.  Sudan  valued  these  loans  because  they 
were  interest  free  and  had  long  grace  periods  before  repayments 
started.  Economic  cooperation  with  China  has  continued.  Relations 
between  Sudan  and  the  Soviet  Union  improved  markedly  following 
al-Numayri’s  overthrow  in  1985,  but  the  regime  change  did  not  result, 
as  Khartoum  had  hoped,  in  Soviet  economic  assistance. 

On  December  31,  1991,  the  World  Bank  closed  its  Khartoum  office. 
The  closure  resulted  from  the  deterioration  in  relations  between  Sudan 
and  international  monetary  bodies  after  Khartoum  ceased  repayment 
of  debt  to  the  World  Bank  and  the  IMF.  In  August  1999,  however,  the 
IMF  dropped  its  sanctions  after  Sudan  reduced  its  arrears  and  imple¬ 
mented  an  IMF  structural  adjustment  program.  Sudan  regained  full 
membership  and  voting  rights  in  the  IMF  and  became  eligible  for  the 
World  Bank’s  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Country  (HIPC)  initiative. 

In  October  1997,  the  United  States  imposed  comprehensive  eco¬ 
nomic,  trade,  and  financial  sanctions  against  Sudan  as  a  result  of  the 
country’s  continued  support  for  international  terrorism,  continued 
efforts  to  destabilize  neighboring  governments,  and  the  prevalence  of 
human-rights  violations.  This  had  a  significant  impact  on  foreign  aid.  In 
2006  the  United  States  expanded  the  provisions  to  block  the  property  of 
persons  connected  with  the  conflict  in  Darfur.  The  United  States  later 
excluded  GOSS  from  the  definition  of  the  government  of  Sudan,  and 
exempted  South  Kordofan  State,  Blue  Nile  State,  Abyei,  Darfur,  and 
marginalized  areas  in  and  around  Khartoum  (four  official  camps  for 
internally  displaced  persons)  from  the  trade  prohibitions.  The  regula¬ 
tions  were  later  amended  to  allow  nongovernmental  organizations 
(NGOs)  involved  in  humanitarian  or  religious  activities  to  provide 
assistance  in  the  specified  areas  of  Sudan  and  to  allow  NGOs  to  apply 
to  the  U.S.  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  for  permission  to  provide 
assistance  in  the  non-specified  areas. 

In  March  2000,  Sudan  signed  two  25 -year,  concessionary  (3 -percent 
interest  rate  and  seven-year  grace  period)  loan  agreements  with  AFESD 
for  US$114  million  to  be  used  to  build  highways  out  of  Khartoum  and 
upgrade  a  dam  for  irrigation.  Sudan  also  came  to  an  agreement  with 
AFESD  about  its  arrears  of  US$214  million.  At  about  the  same  time, 
Sudan  signed  for  a  loan  from  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  for

US$16  million  to  fund  several  water  and  research  projects,  and  it  received 
US$10  million  from  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Coun¬ 
tries  (OPEC)  Fund  for  International  Development  to  upgrade  the  power 
sector.  In  2001  the  IDB  also  provided  a  loan  of  US$6.5  million  for  a  proj¬ 
ect  to  assist  refugees  from  the  civil  war  in  South  Kordofan  State  with 
water  projects,  health  centers,  and  primary  schools. 

Sudan  continued  its  commitment  to  the  IMF  in  2001-2.  However, 
the  2002  budget  projected  a  deficit  of  2.3  percent  of  GDP,  exceeding 
IMF  limits.  In  response,  the  IMF  released  a  report  in  November  2002 
that  criticized  military  spending  and  government  subsidies  on  goods 
such  as  food.  To  maintain  Sudan’s  commitment  to  the  reform  program, 
the  IMF  reduced  the  country’s  payments  to  the  fund  to  US$2  million 
per  month  in  return  for  Sudan’s  promise  to  reduce  its  budget  deficit  to 
1  percent  of  GDP  and  to  reduce  military  spending  by  1 3  percent. 

In  January  2002,  the  European  Union  (EU)  resumed  aid  to  Sudan, 
providing  an  estimated  US$155  million  during  the  period  2002-7.  In 
July  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  promised  US$40 
million  for  various  irrigation  projects,  80  percent  of  the  funds  for  the  con¬ 
struction  of  a  US$3  million  bridge  over  the  Nile  in  Atbarah,  and  US$5 
million  for  new  telephone  exchanges.  In  August  2002,  the  Kuwait  Fund 
for  Arab  Economic  Development  signed  an  agreement  with  the  IDB  to 
provide  US$200  million  for  development  projects,  including  renovation

of  the  Roseires  Dam.  The  Abu  Dhabi  Fund  for  Development,  the 
AFESD,  Qatar,  and  other  Arab  and  Islamic  development  funds  agreed  to 
provide  US$1  billion  for  the  construction  of  a  hydroelectric  plant  at 
Merowe. 

The  United  States  had  spent  US$650  million  in  Sudan’s  strife-tom 
Darfur  region  by  2005,  as  a  result  of  special  appropriations  from  Con¬ 
gress.  In  that  year,  Congress  developed  further  plans  to  boost  emergency 
food  aid  to  Sudan  as  well  as  disaster  relief  and  refugee  aid,  especially  for 
Darfur. 

Following  the  2005  peace  agreement,  Sudan  produced  a  six-year 
recovery  and  development  plan.  Implementation  of  the  first  years, 
2005-7,  required  US$7.8  billion  to  establish  a  health-care  system  and 
build  schools,  roads,  and  railroads  in  areas  neglected  or  destroyed  by 
the  civil  war  in  the  South.  This  amount  did  not  include  the  funds 
required  for  peacekeeping  operations  in  the  South  or  for  restoring  sta¬ 
bility  in  the  Darfur  region.  Sudan  requested  international  donors  to  pro¬ 
vide  US$2.7  billion  (34  percent  of  the  funds)  and  planned  to  provide 
US$5.1  billion  (66  percent)  from  the  country’s  domestic  oil  revenues. 
Although  the  World  Bank  had  just  returned  to  Sudan  and  had  not  yet 
normalized  relations,  it  had  begun  to  provide  technical  advice  on 
wealth  sharing  during  the  peace  process,  and  it  had  agreed  to  manage 
foreign  aid  in  a  multidonor  trust  fund. 

In  March  2009,  after  the  International  Criminal  Court  issued  an 
arrest  warrant  for  President  al-Bashir,  Sudan  expelled  1 3  international 
humanitarian  aid  organizations  and  shut  down  three  national  aid  orga¬ 
nizations.  Those  organizations  had  served  as  U.S.  Government  and  UN 
implementation  partners  in  the  provision  of  water  and  sanitation,  health 
care,  and  protection.  The  UN  maintained  that  these  actions  affected  50 
percent  of  aid  delivery  in  Sudan.  UN  agencies  and  other  remaining 
NGOs  attempted  to  fill  in  to  meet  immediate  humanitarian  needs.  The 
United  States  also  led  the  international  effort  to  support  implementa¬ 
tion  of  the  CPA  while  providing  for  the  humanitarian  needs  of  conflict- 
affected  populations  throughout  the  country.  Such  assistance  included 
food  aid,  provision  of  health  care,  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene,  as 
well  as  programs  for  nutrition,  agriculture,  protection,  and  economic 
recovery. 

Money  and  Banking 

Currency 

In  1992  the  Bank  of  Sudan  introduced  the  Sudanese  dinar  as  a  parallel 
currency  at  a  rate  of  1  Sudanese  dinar  (SDD1)  equal  to  10  Sudanese 
pounds  (SDP10),  and  100  piastres  equal  to  SDD1.  In  1992  and  1993, 


160 


The  Economy 


notes  of  50,  25,  10,  and  5  dinars  were  introduced.  In  1994  a  100-dinar 
note  and  in  1996  a  1 ,000-dinar  note  entered  circulation  as  well.  On  March 
1,  1999,  the  Sudanese  dinar  officially  replaced  the  Sudanese  pound,  and 
the  pound  was  withdrawn  from  circulation  on  July  3 1  of  that  year. 

The  Sudanese  government  informed  the  IMF  in  2005  that  it  was 
opposed  to  circulation  by  the  SPLM  of  an  independent  currency  note,  a 
new  Sudanese  pound,  in  SPLM-controlled  areas.  Nonetheless,  the  gov¬ 
ernment  did  agree  with  the  SPLM  in  February  2005  that  it  would  offi¬ 
cially  replace  the  Sudanese  dinar,  which  had  been  in  circulation  since 
1992,  with  a  new  Sudanese  pound  (Southerners  were  opposed  to  the  use 
of  the  Sudanese  dinar  because  it  symbolized  Islamic  culture).  In  January 
2007,  to  mark  the  second  anniversary  of  the  signing  of  the  Comprehen¬ 
sive  Peace  Agreement,  the  Central  Bank  of  Sudan  introduced  the  new 
Sudanese  pound.  Each  pound  was  divided  into  100  piasters.  One  Suda¬ 
nese  pound  (SDG1)  was  equal  to  100  Sudanese  dinars  (or  1,000  old 
Sudanese  pounds),  and  one  piaster  equaled  1  Sudanese  dinar  (or  1 0  old 
Sudanese  pounds). 

The  official  exchange  rate  was  managed  by  the  Bank  of  Sudan 
through  a  crawling  peg  to  maintain  an  “appropriate”  rate  against  the  U.S. 
dollar.  At  the  end  of  2008,  the  exchange  rate  of  Sudanese  pounds  and 
U.S.  dollars  was  US$  1  =  SDG2. 1 8.  On  July,  3 1 , 20 1 1 ,  the  rate  was  USS 1 
=  SDD2.67. 

Banking 

Sudan  inherited  its  banking  system  from  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Con¬ 
dominium  (1899-1955).  When  the  National  Bank  of  Egypt  opened  in 
Khartoum  in  1901,  it  obtained  a  privileged  position  as  banker  to  and 
for  the  government,  being  a  semiofficial  central  bank.  Other  banks  fol¬ 
lowed,  but  the  National  Bank  of  Egypt  and  Barclays  Bank  in  Britain 
dominated  and  stabilized  banking  in  Sudan  until  after  World  War  II. 
Postwar  prosperity  created  a  demand  for  an  increasing  number  of 
commercial  banks. 

Before  Sudanese  independence,  there  were  no  restrictions  on  the 
movement  of  funds  between  Egypt  and  Sudan,  and  the  value  of  the 
currency  used  in  Sudan  was  tied  to  that  of  Egypt.  This  situation  was 
unsatisfactory  to  an  independent  Sudan,  which  established  the  Sudan 
Currency  Board  to  replace  Egyptian  and  British  money.  It  was  not  a 
central  bank  because  it  did  not  accept  deposits,  loan  money,  or  provide 
commercial  banks  with  cash  and  liquidity. 

A  three-member  commission  from  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserve  Sys¬ 
tem,  established  in  1956,  provided  recommendations  for  establishing  a 
central  bank  in  Sudan.  In  1959  the  Bank  of  Sudan  succeeded  the  Sudan 
Currency  Board,  taking  over  the  Sudanese  assets  of  the  National  Bank 


161 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


of  Egypt,  and  acting  as  the  central  bank  of  Sudan,  issuing  currency, 
assisting  the  development  of  banks,  providing  loans,  maintaining 
financial  equilibrium,  and  advising  the  government. 

The  Bank  of  Sudan  used  policy  instruments,  including  interest-rate 
policies,  to  control  the  quantity  of  money  in  circulation  from  its  estab¬ 
lishment  until  1984,  when  Islamic  laws  were  introduced.  After  the  com¬ 
plete  Islamization  of  the  banking  system  in  1992,  the  Bank  of  Sudan 
eliminated  treasury  bills  and  government  bonds  that  carried  interest 
rates.  In  their  place,  the  bank  issued  financial  certificates  conforming  to 
the  Islamic  system.  To  ensure  that  banking  operations  would  be  free  of 
practices  that  might  be  deemed  usurious,  the  Sharia  High  Supervisory 
Board  became  a  part  of  the  Bank  in  1993. 

Among  the  measures  introduced  by  the  1 997  IMF  economic  reform 
program  was  a  system  of  Islamic  open-market  operations,  with  central 
bank  short-term  and  long-term  profit-sharing  certificates  sold  at  weekly 
auctions  to  control  liquidity.  The  central  bank  also  began  to  require 
commercial  banks  to  comply  more  closely  with  minimum  reserve 
requirements  and  established  a  discount  window  for  short-term  bank 
credit  that  increased  the  impact  of  the  interest-rate  policy.  The  bank 
abolished  the  extension  of  low-cost  credit  to  the  central  government 
and  state-owned  institutions. 

There  were  originally  five  major  commercial  banks  (Bank  of  Khar¬ 
toum,  An-Nilein  Bank,  Sudan  Commercial  Bank,  the  People’s  Cooper¬ 
ative  Bank,  and  the  Unity  Bank),  but  the  number  subsequently  grew.  In 
1 970  the  banks  were  nationalized  and  became  controlled  by  the  Bank  of 
Sudan.  As  of  2003,  however,  there  were  once  again  private-  as  well  as 
public-sector  banks. 

To  encourage  foreign  capital  investment,  in  1974  foreign  banks  were 
urged  to  establish  joint  ventures  in  association  with  Sudanese  capital. 
Banking  transactions  with  foreign  companies  operating  in  Sudan  were 
facilitated  so  long  as  they  abided  by  the  rulings  of  the  Bank  of  Sudan 
and  transferred  a  minimum  of  SDP3  million  into  Sudan.  Several  for¬ 
eign  banks  took  advantage  of  this  “open-door”  policy,  most  notably 
Citibank,  the  Faisal  Islamic  Bank,  Chase  Manhattan  Bank,  and  the 
Arab  Authority  for  Agricultural  Investment  and  Development.  In  early 
2011,  two  foreign  banks  had  branches  in  Sudan,  Abu  Dhabi  National 
Bank  and  Estates  Commercial  Bank. 

In  2010  the  Bank  of  Sudan  had  14  branches,  including  the  Bank  of 
South  Sudan,  which  remained  a  branch  and  continued  to  render  con¬ 
ventional  (non-Islamized)  banking  services  within  a  dual  banking  sys¬ 
tem.  There  also  were  23  commercial  banks.  In  addition  to  commercial 
banks,  the  government  also  established  numerous  specialized  banks. 
They  included  the  Agricultural  Bank,  the  Savings  &  Social  Develop¬ 
ment  Bank  (owned  by  the  public  sector),  and  the  Financial  Investment 


162 


The  Economy 


Bank  (owned  by  the  private  sector).  The  commercial  and  other  spe¬ 
cialized  banks  had  535  branches  throughout  the  country. 

The  banking  system  had  worked  effectively  until  the  late  1970s  and 
1980s,  when  the  decline  in  foreign  trade,  balance-of-payments  prob¬ 
lems,  spiraling  external  debt,  increased  corruption,  and  the  introduction 
ot  Islamic  banking  disrupted  the  financial  system.  Some  reforms  were 
introduced  in  the  IMF  economic  adjustment  program,  but  further  reform 
of  the  system  was  an  important  consideration  while  developing  the  Jan¬ 
uary  2005  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  to  end  the  civil  war  in 
Sudan.  One  of  the  decisions  at  that  time  was  that  Sudan  would  have  a 
dual  banking  system.  As  a  result,  the  North  retained  an  Islamic  banking 
system,  whereas  the  South  adopted  interest-based  banking.  In  2005  the 
GOSS  created  a  central  bank,  the  Bank  of  South  Sudan,  which  func¬ 
tioned  as  a  branch  of  the  Bank  of  Sudan  and  shared  its  monetary  poli¬ 
cies.  Several  foreign  banks  established  branches  in  Juba. 

Islamic  Banking 

The  Faisal  Islamic  Bank,  whose  principal  patron  was  the  Saudi 
prince,  Muhammad  ibn  Faisal  al-Saud,  was  established  in  1977.  The 
open-door  policy  enabled  Saudi  Arabia,  which  had  a  huge  surplus  after 
the  1973  OPEC  increases  in  the  price  of  petroleum,  to  invest  in  Sudan. 
Members  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  (see  Glossary)  and  its  political 
arm,  the  National  Islamic  Front,  play  a  prominent  role  on  the  bank’s 
board  of  directors.  It  was  the  first  sharia-based  bank  to  open  a  branch  in 
Khartoum.  Other  Islamic  banks  followed.  As  a  consequence,  both  the 
Ansar  (see  Glossary)  and  Khatmiyyah  (see  Glossary)  religious  groups 
and  their  political  parties,  the  Umma  and  the  Democratic  Unionist 
Party,  formed  their  own  Islamic  banks.  At  the  time,  both  Islamic  and 
conventional  banking  systems  operated  together.  However,  the  Faisal 
Islamic  Bank  enjoyed  certain  privileges  denied  other  commercial 
banks  (full  tax  exemption  on  assets,  profits,  wages,  and  pensions)  as 
well  as  guarantees  against  confiscation  or  nationalization. 

Al-Salam  Bank’s  Sudan  affiliate  and  Emirates  and  Sudan  Bank 
(ESB),  established  in  2006,  were  the  two  newest  foreign  banks  in  early 
2011.  Al-Salam  Bank  Sudan  was  founded  by  a  consortium  of  United 
Arab  Emirates  (UAE)  and  Sudanese  investors.  The  Emirates  and  Sudan 
Bank  was  established  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  60  percent  of  the 
Bank  of  Khartoum  by  Dubai  Islamic  Bank  (DIB).  The  government  of 
Sudan  had  previously  owned  99  percent  of  Bank  of  Khartoum,  Sudan's 
first  bank,  dating  from  1913.  Both  Al-Salam  Bank  Sudan  and  Emirates 
and  Sudan  Bank  claimed  to  be  the  largest  banks  in  Sudan,  with  opera¬ 
tions  fully  sharia  compliant.  Both  banks  intended  to  open  branches 
throughout  the  country  to  support  development,  including  rebuilding 


163 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


the  southern  areas  of  Sudan  as  well  as  other  areas  affected  by  the  civil 
war. 

By  1992  the  Bank  of  Sudan  eliminated  treasury  bills  and  govern¬ 
ment  bonds,  instruments  on  which  interest  was  paid,  and  substituted 
financial  certificates  conforming  to  the  Islamic  system.  The  central 
bank  continued  to  be  the  bank  for  the  central  and  regional  governments 
and  for  semigovemmental  institutions.  It  also  served  as  the  lender  to 
the  government  and  lender  of  last  resort  to  the  banks. 

The  theory  of  Islamic  banking  was  derived  from  the  Quran  and  the 
Prophet  Muhammad's  exhortations  against  exploitation  and  the  unjust 
acquisition  of  wealth  defined  as  riba ,  meaning  interest  or  usury.  Profit 
and  trade  were  encouraged  and  provided  the  foundation  for  Islamic 
banking.  The  prohibitions  against  interest  were  founded  on  the  Islamic 
concept  of  property  as  resulting  either  from  an  individual's  creative 
labor  or  from  exchange  of  goods  or  property.  Interest  on  money  loaned 
fell  within  neither  of  these  two  concepts  and  was  thus  unjustified. 

To  resolve  this  dilemma  from  a  legal  and  religious  point  of  view, 
Islamic  banking  employed  common  terms:  musharakah,  or  partnership 
for  production;  mudharabah ,  or  silent  partnership  when  one  party  pro¬ 
vides  the  capital,  the  other  the  labor;  and  murabbahah ,  or  deferred  pay¬ 
ment  on  purchases,  similar  in  practice  to  an  overdraft  and  the  most- 
favored  Islamic  banking  arrangement  in  Sudan.  To  resolve  the  prohibi¬ 
tion  on  interest,  an  interest-bearing  overdraft  would  be  changed  to  a 
murabbahah  contract.  The  fundamental  difference  between  Islamic  and 
traditional  banking  systems  is  that  in  an  Islamic  system  deposits  are 
regarded  as  shares,  hence  their  nominal  value  is  not  guaranteed. 

There  were  many  government-sponsored  Islamic  initiatives  in 
Sudan,  resisted  by  the  predominantly  Christian  South.  However,  the 
Islamic  banks  were  apparently  successful  there,  too,  and  avoided  the 
controversy  of  other  Islamic  initiatives.  The  sector  experienced  rapid 
growth,  expected  to  accelerate  with  future  economic  reconstruction 
and  increased  production  in  Sudan's  oil  fields. 

Labor  Force,  Wages,  and  Unions 

Labor  Force 

The  size  of  Sudan’s  labor  force  is  difficult  to  determine  because  of 
the  various  definitions  of  participation  in  economic  activity  and  the 
absence  of  accurate  data  from  official  sources.  In  rural  areas,  large 
numbers  of  women  and  girls  engage  in  traditional  productive  occupa¬ 
tions,  but  many  probably  are  not  included  in  calculations  of  the  active 
workforce.

The  Economy 


More  than  7.9  million  people  were  employed  in  Sudan  in  1989, 
according  to  an  International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  estimate.  In  the 
early  1990s,  the  employment  scene  was  exacerbated  by  the  1991  Per¬ 
sian  Gulf  War,  which  resulted  in  the  return  home  of  thousands  of  Suda¬ 
nese  workers  who  had  been  based  in  Kuwait  and  Iraq,  leaving  many  of 
their  possessions  behind.  Sudan’s  support  of  Iraq  was  also  a  factor  in  the 
departure  of  thousands  of  Sudanese  workers  from  Saudi  Arabia.  By 
2000,  the  total  labor  force  of  Sudan  had  grown  to  an  estimated  12  mil¬ 
lion,  of  which  the  government  counted  9.6  million  as  actively  employed. 
Approximately  30  percent  of  the  workforce  was  female. 

Unemployment  figures  were  affected  by  the  severe  drought  that 
spread  throughout  Sudan  in  the  1980s.  In  1983-84,  for  example,  sev¬ 
eral  million  people  migrated  from  the  worst-hit  areas  in  both  Western 
and  Eastern  Sudan  to  Khartoum  and  other  urban  areas  along  the  Nile. 
Many  remained  in  these  areas  once  the  drought  had  eased,  living  in 
shantytowns  and  contributing  to  unemployment,  underemployment,  or 
employment  in  the  informal  sector  in  the  cities.  In  addition,  more  than 
2  million  people  from  the  South  migrated  to  the  North  over  the  years, 
as  a  result  of  the  civil  war  and  famines  in  these  areas.  In  2009  the  gov¬ 
ernment  estimated  unemployment  at  about  20  percent,  perhaps  not  an 
accurate  figure,  because  a  large  proportion  of  Sudanese  engaged  in 
small-scale  and  subsistence  agriculture. 

The  minimum  working  age  in  the  early  2000s  was  1 8  in  theory;  how¬ 
ever,  the  law  was  not  enforced,  and  some  27  percent  of  Sudanese  chil¬ 
dren  aged  10  to  14  were  estimated  to  be  in  the  labor  force.  For  example, 
children  as  young  as  1 1  or  12  years  of  age  worked  in  a  number  of  facto¬ 
ries  outside  the  capital  that  produced  edible  oils.  Child  labor  was  wide¬ 
spread  in  the  informal  economy,  and  children  traditionally  worked  on 
the  family  farm  from  a  young  age.  Sudan  did  not  adhere  to  ILO  Con¬ 
vention  no.  182,  the  Worst  Forms  of  Child  Labor.  The  Child  Act  of 
2010,  among  other  laws,  governed  hours  and  working  conditions  of 
young  people,  but  the  law  was  not  effectively  enforced,  particularly  in 
the  informal  sector,  where  enforcement  was  especially  difficult. 

Agriculture  was  formerly  the  predominant  activity  in  Sudan,  although 
its  share  of  the  labor  force  gradually  declined  as  other  sectors  of  eco¬ 
nomic  activity  expanded.  In  the  1955-56  census,  almost  86  percent  of 
those  then  considered  as  part  of  the  workforce  were  involved  in  agricul¬ 
ture,  livestock  raising,  forestry,  fisheries,  or  hunting.  The  ILO  estimated 
that  by  1998,  the  figure  had  declined  to  70-80  percent.  By  2008  the  gov¬ 
ernment  claimed  that  the  percentage  was  significantly  lower.  The  ser¬ 
vices  sector,  which  included  a  government  workforce  that  grew  about  10 
percent  a  year  in  the  1970s,  emerged  as  the  second  largest  area  of  activ¬ 
ity,  encompassing  an  estimated  13-22  percent  of  those  economically 


165

active  in  1998,  compared  with  4.6  percent  in  1955-56.  The  industry  sec¬ 
tor,  including  manufacturing,  mining,  electric  power,  and  construction, 
accounted  for  7-9  percent  during  1998,  compared  to  5.6  percent  in 
1955-56. 

The  proportions  of  the  labor  force  in  each  of  these  sectors  undoubtedly 
changed  after  the  estimates  were  made  in  1998,  as  the  relative  importance 
of  these  sectors  altered  in  the  succeeding  years.  It  was  difficult  to  deter¬ 
mine  the  extent  of  the  changes,  however,  as  despite  the  oil  sector’s  great 
importance,  it  did  not  directly  employ  many  people.  Its  impact  on 
employment  occurred  as  a  result  of  the  increased  spending  allowed  to  the 
government,  which  created  new  jobs,  often  in  the  public  sector. 

The  1 998  constitution  prohibited  forced  and  bonded  labor,  although 
it  did  not  specifically  prohibit  trafficking  in  persons.  Nevertheless, 
there  were  credible  reports  that  slavery  persisted,  particularly  affecting 
women  and  children,  and  that  the  seizure  and  sale  of  women  as 
domestic  servants  continued.  All  sides  in  the  Sudanese  conflict  also 
conscripted  men  and  boys  forcibly  into  their  fighting  forces.  In  May 
1998,  the  government  formed  the  Committee  for  the  Eradication  of  the 
Abduction  of  Women  and  Children,  which  resulted  in  the  identifica¬ 
tion  and  release  of  several  hundred  abductees,  but  the  government  did 
not  police  the  laws  on  forced  and  bonded  labor  effectively.  In  Novem¬ 
ber  2001,  the  government  announced  the  establishment  of  special 
civilian  tribunals  in  the  border  regions  separating  the  South  and  the 
North  of  the  country  to  prosecute  persons  involved  in  the  abduction, 
transport,  holding,  and  selling  or  exchanging  of  women  and  children 
from  war  zones.  Even  so,  as  late  as  2010,  the  Committee  surmised  that 
possibly  10.000  or  more  abductees  from  groups  such  as  the  Misiriyyah 
and  Rizayqat  as  well  as  South  Sudanese  were  engaged  in  some  form 
of  forced  labor  in  the  border  regions. 

The  Informal  Sector 

It  is  difficult  to  obtain  data  on  the  informal  sector,  even  though  it  is 
a  very  large  part  of  the  Sudanese  economy.  However,  a  1993  report 
indicated  that  with  close  to  60  percent  unemployment  in  the  cities  as  a 
result  of  high  urbanization,  only  10  percent  of  the  population  could 
find  work  in  the  formal  sector.  A  later  report  indicated  that  by  1 996,  as 
a  result  of  declines  in  the  agricultural  and  services  sectors,  the  infor¬ 
mal  sector  accounted  for  90  percent  of  total  job  opportunities  created 
( 1 .6  million  out  of  1 .8  million  jobs). 

Informal-sector  activities  in  rural  areas  include  labor  on  small  farms 
(with  payment  in  either  money  or  food);  selling  firewood,  charcoal,  or 
grass  for  animal  feed;  collecting  and  selling  wild  fruits;  carrying  water 
and  other  low-status  labor;  or  working  as  paid  domestic  labor.  People

involved  in  the  informal  economy  also  create  mechanisms  to  provide 
credit,  wholesaling,  and  marketing  and  distribution  services  through¬ 
out  the  country  where  formal  institutions  do  not  exist. 

In  the  urban  areas,  the  informal  sector  includes  not  only  the  poor,  but 
also  many  middle-class  professionals  who  have  to  increase  their  income 
by  working  second  jobs,  often  as  traders  or  taxi  drivers.  Internally  dis¬ 
placed  persons  (IDPs)  are  also  among  informal-sector  entrepreneurs. 
They,  among  others,  are  a  source  of  cheap,  casual  labor,  in  areas  ranging 
from  labor  in  the  construction  industry  to  selling  tea  or  cooked  food 
along  the  streets.  Some  informal-sector  work  is  also  illegal,  such  as  the 
production  and  sale  of  alcohol  and  prostitution.  Another  activity  is  the 
exchange  of  hard  currency  into  Sudanese  currency,  either  in  Sudan  or  in 
currency  markets  outside  the  country.  The  remitted  income  is  redistrib¬ 
uted  through  family  networks  and  supports  a  substantial  portion  of  the 
population.  The  government  has  tried  to  suppress,  control,  or  tax  the 
informal  sector  but  without  success.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Most  requirements  for  operating  a  business  in  Sudan,  except  for 
finance,  can  be  met  as  easily  by  informal  as  formal,  registered  firms, 
and  the  market  for  labor  is  perhaps  more  flexible  for  informal  than  for 
formal  firms.  In  addition,  the  costs  and  risks  of  informality  are  some¬ 
times  more  manageable  than  the  larger  risks  associated  with  formally 
paying  taxes.  Therefore,  reducing  the  informal  sector  requires  actions 
to  significantly  increase  productivity  in  the  formal  sector,  especially  in 
the  markets  for  finance,  labor,  and  other  inputs. 

A  number  of  organizations,  especially  nongovernmental  organiza¬ 
tions,  work  in  the  informal  sector,  particularly  with  IDPs,  who  have  to 
change  the  way  they  make  their  living  because  in  the  refugee  camps 
they  no  longer  have  access  to  agricultural  land.  The  NGOs  provide 
training  in  various  technical  skills  and  help  participants  establish 
small-scale  businesses.  In  many  communities,  women  have  had  to 
become  self-sufficient,  feeding  themselves  and  their  families,  if  their 
husbands  were  killed  in  the  war  or  migrated  to  the  cities  in  search  of 
work.  Some  of  the  most  successful  projects  in  those  areas  train  women 
in  small-scale  food-processing  skills,  such  as  production  of  pasta, 
dehydrated  onions  and  garlic,  artificially  flavored  juices,  tomato  paste, 
and  jams,  to  help  them  become  more  competitive  in  local  markets  and 
to  have  food  to  eat  when  they  otherwise  might  not.  Other  projects  help 
organize  women’s  development  associations  to  produce  collectively 
for  the  market  and  also  to  provide  various  types  of  support  for  poor 
women  in  their  areas. 

Wages 

Public-sector  wages  generally  are  higher  than  those  of  the  privately 
employed,  except  in  a  few  large  private  firms.  Until  late  1974,  when  the 
Minimum  Standard  of  Wages  Order  (Presidential  Order  no.  21)  was 
issued,  there  had  not  been  a  minimum  wage  in  the  private  sector, 
although  in  a  few  occupations,  such  as  stevedoring  at  Port  Sudan,  offi¬ 
cial  wage  orders  had  set  certain  minimums.  The  1974  minimum,  estab¬ 
lished  at  SDP16.50  a  month,  was  equivalent  to  the  minimum  entry  wage 
for  public-sector  jobs.  It  applied,  however,  basically  only  to  workers  in 
establishments  having  10  or  more  employees  in  the  Khartoum  area,  Al- 
Gezira,  and  certain  other  urban  centers.  Its  geographical  limitations 
together  with  important  exemptions — employees  below  the  age  of  1 8, 
all  those  in  enterprises  having  fewer  than  10  workers,  seasonal  agricul¬ 
tural  workers,  and  some  others — excluded  about  three-quarters  of  all 
wage  earners. 

The  Labor  Act  of  1997  replaced  the  Manpower  Act  of  1974  and  set 
forth  the  organization  of  employment  (including  provisions  for  women 
and  juveniles),  contracts  of  service,  wages,  working  hours  and  leave, 


168 


The  Economy 


termination  of  employment,  after-service  benefits,  and  miscellaneous 
other  provisions.  It  also  listed  categories  of  persons  who  were  exempt 
from  the  act,  among  them  domestic  servants,  agricultural  workers  other 
than  persons  employed  in  establishments  that  process  agricultural 
products,  and  casual  workers. 

The  minimum  wage  was  established  by  a  commission  consisting  of 
specialized  members  representing  the  state,  workers,  and  employers, 
and  enforced  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor.  Workers  denied  the  minimum 
wage  could  file  a  grievance  with  their  local  Ministry  of  Labor  field 
office.  In  April  2004,  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Administrative  Reform, 
the  Sudanese  Businessmen  and  Employers  Federation,  and  the  Sudan 
Workers’  Trade  Union  Federation  (SWTUF)  agreed  to  raise  the  mini¬ 
mum  wage  to  SDD  12,500  (US$48)  per  month.  By  201 1  it  had  increased 
to  SDG  265  (US$90)  per  month. 

Unions 

The  labor-union  movement  originated  in  1946  with  the  formation, 
by  some  Sudan  Railways  employees,  of  the  Workers’  Affairs  Associa¬ 
tion.  Two  years  later,  the  Trades  and  Tradesmen's  Union  Ordinance  of 
1948,  which  was  based  largely  on  the  British  model  and  the  concepts 
of  voluntary  association  and  limited  government  intervention  in  union 
affairs,  gave  official  sanction  to  the  unions.  A  proliferation  of  mostly 
small,  ineffective  bodies  emerged.  The  major  exception  was  the  rail 
union,  which  became  Sudan’s  wealthiest  and  most  powerful  union.  In 
1949  the  workers'  association  helped  start  the  national  Workers'  Con¬ 
gress,  which  in  1950  became  the  Sudan  Workers’  Trade  Union  Feder¬ 
ation.  The  SWTUF  was  closely  associated  with  the  Sudan  Communist 
Party  (SCP),  and  its  actions  were  strongly  political.  It  failed  to  receive 
government  recognition.  After  national  independence,  the  federation 
had  frequent  confrontations  with  the  new  government,  including  a 
successful  general  strike  in  October  1958.  That  strike  was  one  of  the 
factors  that  contributed  to  the  military  takeover  of  the  government  the 
following  month. 

The  SWTUF  controlled  roughly  70  percent  of  all  labor-union  mem¬ 
bership  by  the  1958  coup.  The  new  military  government  repealed  the 
1 948  ordinance,  dissolved  all  unions,  and  detained  many  of  the  federa¬ 
tion's  leaders.  Some  union  organization  was  again  permitted  after  1960, 
but  it  was  prohibited  for  white-collar  workers,  and  federations  were  not 
allowed.  Upon  restoration  of  the  civilian  government  in  1964,  the  1948 
ordinance  was  reinstated,  the  SWTUF  reemerged,  and  union  member¬ 
ship  increased  rapidly.  Most  unions  were  small,  financially  weak,  and 
generally  not  very  effective.  The  few  larger  unions  were  in  the  public 
sector,  led  by  the  Sudan  Railway  Workers’  Union. 


169 


Sudan:  A  Countiy  Study 


SWTUF  leadership  remained  in  communist  hands.  The  SCP  was 
allied  with  the  group  that  carried  out  the  military  coup  of  May  1969. 
Strikes,  however,  were  prohibited  by  a  presidential  order  issued  shortly 
after  the  1969  takeover.  After  the  abortive  communist  coup  in  mid- 
1971,  the  government  dissolved  the  SWTUF  and  executed  a  number 
of  its  leaders. 

Late  in  1971,  the  government  promulgated  the  new  Trade  Unions  Act, 
under  which  directives  were  issued  in  1973  that  established  a  list  of  87 
unions  based  along  sectoral,  occupational,  and  industrial  lines.  Somewhat 
more  than  half  were  “employees”  unions  (for  white-collar  employees), 
and  the  rest  “workers”  unions  (for  blue-collar  workers).  The  existing 
unions  were  merged  into  the  specified  groupings.  The  act  contained  mea¬ 
sures  to  strengthen  unionism,  including  a  provision  for  compulsory  dues 
and  employer-paid  time  off  to  serve  as  union  officials.  The  SWTUF  was 
reinstituted  for  the  workers’  unions,  and  the  Sudanese  Federation  of 
Employees  and  Professionals  Trade  Unions  was  formed  in  1975  for  the 
white-collar  group.  Their  representation  of  union  interests  was  carried  on 
within  guidelines  set  by  the  government  and  the  Sudan  Socialist  Union 
(SSU),  the  mass  political  party  established  by  the  government  in  1972.  In 
the  late  1970s,  the  unions  led  strikes,  which,  although  illegal,  resulted  in 
settlement  of  issues  through  negotiations  with  the  government.  Prior  to 
1989,  the  SWTUF,  in  its  weakened  state,  included  42  trade  unions,  repre¬ 
senting  more  than  1 .7  million  workers  in  the  public  and  private  sectors. 
The  federation  was  affiliated  with  the  International  Confederation  of 
Arab  Trade  Unions  and  the  Organization  of  African  Trade  Union  Unity. 

Following  the  1989  coup,  the  Revolutionary  Command  Council  for 
National  Salvation  (RCC-NS)  temporarily  suspended  the  right  to  orga¬ 
nize  and  bargain  collectively  and  prescribed  punishments,  including  the 
death  penalty,  for  violations  of  its  labor  decrees.  Many  union  leaders 
were  arrested.  Prior  to  the  1989  coup,  leaders  of  the  SWTUF  fonned  a 
union  in  exile,  the  Legitimate  Sudan  Workers  Trade  Union  Federation, 
which  carried  on  secret  trade  union  activities  in  Sudan. 

The  Trade  Union  Act  of  1992  facilitated  the  government’s  defini¬ 
tion  of  the  sectors,  industries,  and  companies  that  could  form  trade 
unions,  allowed  it  to  intervene  in  the  internal  affairs  of  the  unions  and 
their  elections,  and  provided  for  the  suspension  or  dissolution  of  the 
unions.  In  1993  the  government  amalgamated  the  107  sectoral  trade 
unions  into  26  trade  unions.  In  1996  the  number  was  reduced  to  13 
unions.  The  Labor  Act  of  1997  included  a  section  on  resolution  of  trade 
disputes  and  a  requirement  that  employers  negotiate  with  employees 
through  a  lawful  trade  union  if  they  had  such  representation. 

Strikes  and  protests  occurred  in  1998  over  the  privatization  of  state 
corporations  and  public  services,  an  action  that  had  caused  massive  job 


170 


The  Economy 


losses.  In  1999  and  again  in  2000,  teachers  went  on  strike  for  several 
months,  each  time  to  protest  the  government’s  failure  to  pay  salaries. 

The  1998  constitution  provided  the  right  of  association  for  trade- 
union  purposes,  but  in  2011  the  government  continued  to  restrict  this 
right.  Only  the  government-controlled  SWTUF,  the  leading  blue-collar 
labor  organization  with  about  800,000  members,  functioned  legally.  The 
government  again  imposed  severe  punishments,  including  the  death 
penalty,  for  violation  of  its  labor  decrees.  However,  the  International 
Labour  Organisation  frequently  noted  that  the  trade-union  monopoly 
was  contrary  to  the  principles  of  freedom  of  association,  and  the  Interna¬ 
tional  Confederation  of  Free  Trade  Unions  continued  to  recognize  the 
Legitimate  Sudan  Workers  Trade  Union  Federation,  the  national  trade- 
union  organization  that  functioned  prior  to  the  ban  and  that  continued  to 
operate  in  exile. 

The  law  allowed  labor  committees  the  right  to  organize  and  bargain 
collectively;  however,  in  practice,  the  government’s  control  of  the 
steering  committees  meant  that  it  dominated  the  process  of  setting 
wages  and  working  conditions.  The  law  also  did  not  prohibit  anti-union 
discrimination.  Moreover,  strikes  were  considered  illegal  unless  the 
government  granted  approval,  which  never  occurred.  Therefore,  most 
employees  who  tried  to  strike  were  subject  to  employment  termination, 
although  workers  who  went  on  strike  in  recent  years,  including  in 
2008,  were  not  terminated,  and  there  were  no  reports  of  union  leaders 
being  detained  or  unfairly  dismissed  in  201 1 . 

Agriculture,  Livestock,  Fisheries,  and  Forestry 

Agriculture  and  livestock  raising  were  the  main  sources  of  liveli¬ 
hood  for  the  Sudanese  population  in  2011.  It  was  estimated  that  80 
percent  of  the  labor  force  were  employed  in  that  sector,  including  84 
percent  of  the  women  and  64  percent  of  the  men. 

Agricultural  products  regularly  accounted  for  about  80  to  95  percent 
of  exports  until  the  oil  industry  came  on  line.  Total  sector  activities 
contributed  an  estimated  35.5  percent  of  GDP  in  2006,  a  decline  from 
the  years  prior  to  the  development  of  the  oil  industry.  Crop  cultivation 
was  divided  between  a  market-oriented  sector  comprising  mechanized, 
large-scale  irrigated  and  rain-fed  farming  (mainly  in  central  Sudan) 
and  small-scale  farming  following  traditional  practices  carried  out  in 
parts  of  the  country  where  rainfall  or  other  water  sources  were  suffi¬ 
cient  for  cultivation. 

Large  investments  occurred  over  time  in  mechanized,  irrigated,  and 
rain-fed  agriculture,  which  together  accounted  for  roughly  two-thirds 
of  Sudan’s  cultivated  land.  The  early  emphasis  on  growing  cotton  on 
irrigated  land  decreased.  Although  cotton  remained  important,  peanuts, 


171 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


wheat,  and  sugarcane  became  major  crops,  and  considerable  quantities 
of  sesame  also  were  grown.  Rain-fed  mechanized  fanning  continued  to 
produce  mostly  sorghum,  but  the  cultivation  of  sesame  increased,  and 
short-fiber  cotton  also  was  grown.  Production  in  both  subsectors 
increased  domestic  supplies  and  export  potential.  This  gain  appeared, 
however,  to  have  been  achieved  mainly  by  expanding  the  cultivated 
area  rather  than  by  increasing  productivity. 

Most  subsistence  cultivators  produced  sorghum  as  their  staple  crop, 
although  in  the  northerly  rain-fed  cultivated  areas  millet  was  the  prin¬ 
cipal  staple.  Subsistence  farmers  also  grew  peanuts  and  sesame.  Fol¬ 
lowing  food  shortages  in  2001,  there  was  an  attempt  to  increase  land 
area  for  the  production  of  food.  The  increase  in  food  production,  how¬ 
ever,  was  at  the  expense  of  the  production  of  export  crops,  although 
export  crops  increased  in  2004  and  the  export  of  sesame  and  cotton 
continued  to  increase  through  2008. 

Land  Use 

The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  estimated  that  Sudan  had  84  million 
hectares  (see  Glossary)  of  potentially  arable  land.  The  area  under  per¬ 
manent  crops  was  estimated  at  more  than  19  million  hectares  in  2010, 
about  23  percent  of  potential  arable  land. 

Substantial  variations  existed  in  land  classified  as  actually  used  or 
potentially  usable  for  livestock  grazing.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
and  the  United  Nations  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO) 
classified  about  24  million  hectares  as  pastureland.  In  1975,  however,  a 
United  Nations  interagency  mission  to  Sudan  had  estimated  the  total 
potential  grazing  land  at  between  120  million  and  1 50  million  hectares. 
Total  forest  area  declined  from  71.2  million  hectares  in  1990  to  61.6 
million  hectares  in  2000.  The  use  of  some  woodland  areas  for  grazing, 
the  dearth  of  rainfall  during  the  1980s,  and  the  ecological  damage  from 
mechanized  farming  caused  steady  deforestation. 

In  2011  Sudan  still  had  a  substantial  amount  of  land  suitable  for 
future  cropping.  The  1975  UN  mission  believed  that  two-thirds  of  the 
potential  area  for  livestock  grazing,  however,  was  already  in  use,  and 
that  proportion  had  probably  increased  over  time  with  the  rising  num¬ 
bers  of  livestock.  In  addition  to  land  suitable  for  cultivation  and  live¬ 
stock  grazing,  Sudan  also  had  about  76  million  to  86  million  hectares  of 
desert.  An  area  of  about  2.9  million  hectares  was  covered  by  swamps 
and  inland  water,  and  additional  land  was  occupied  by  urban  settle¬

Land  Tenure 

The  right  to  own  property,  to  bequeath  it  to  heirs,  and  to  inherit  it  was 
established  by  the  1973  constitution  (then  known  as  the  Permanent  Con¬ 
stitution),  although  that  right  was  suspended  in  1985.  Sudan  has  long  had 
a  system  of  land  registration  through  which  an  individual,  an  enterprise, 
or  the  government  can  establish  title  to  a  piece  of  land.  Such  registration 
was  extensive  in  Northern  Sudan,  especially  in  the  then-states  of  Al- 
Khartoum,  Al-Awsat,  and  Ash  Shamali.  Before  1970  all  other  land 
(unregistered)  belonged  to  the  state,  which  held  ownership  in  trust  for  the 
people,  who  had  customary  rights  to  it. 

The  Unregistered  Land  Act  of  1970  declared  that  all  waste,  forest, 
and  unregistered  lands  were  government  land.  Private  land  was  lim¬ 
ited  to  that  registered  before  1970  under  a  1929  land  ordinance  and 
was  limited  to  agricultural  land  along  the  Nile  and  a  few  areas  along 
other  water  courses.  Such  land  amounted  to  only  about  1  percent  of  all 
land.  Individuals  could,  however,  lease  land  from  the  government  and 
gain  usufruct  rights. 

The  government  owned  most  of  the  land  used  by  the  modem  agricul¬ 
tural  sector  and  leased  it  to  tenants  (for  example,  in  the  Gezira  Scheme)  or 
to  private  entrepreneurs,  such  as  most  operators  of  large-scale  mechanized

rain-fed  farming.  The  lease  rights  were  for  specified  periods  of  time;  for 
example,  leases  rights  for  the  large  mechanized  farms  were  typically  for 
25  years. 

There  were  also  many  variants  of  land  tenure.  The  communal  land 
used  for  pasture  and  for  subsistence  cultivation  was  owned  by  the  gov¬ 
ernment  but  under  the  control  of  the  community  or  local  leader,  who 
allocated  it  to  households  of  the  village  or  ethnic  group  for  their  exclu¬ 
sive  cultivation.  The  rights  to  such  land  might  be  passed  on  to  heirs,  but 
ordinarily  the  land  could  not  be  sold  or  otherwise  disposed  of,  nor  used 
as  collateral.  The  right  was  also  retained  to  land  left  fallow,  although  in 
Bahr  al-Ghazal,  Upper  Nile,  and  Equatoria  there  were  communities 
where  another  individual  could  claim  such  land  by  clearing  it. 

Among  the  transhumant  communities  of  the  North,  the  rights  to  culti¬ 
vated  land  were  much  the  same,  but  the  dominant  position  of  livestock 
in  community  activities  introduced  certain  other  communal  rights  that 
included  common  rights  to  grazing  land,  the  right-of-way  to  water  and 
grazing  land,  the  right  to  grass  on  agricultural  land  unless  the  occupier 
cut  and  stacked  it,  and  the  right  to  crop  residues  unless  similarly  treated. 
In  the  western  savannas,  private  ownership  of  stands  of  hashab  (gum 
arabic)  trees  could  be  registered,  an  exception  to  the  usual  government 
ownership  of  the  forests,  but  dead  wood  for  domestic  fuel  and  the  under¬ 
lying  grass  were  common  property.  Water,  a  matter  of  greatest  impor¬ 
tance  to  stock  raisers,  was  open  to  all  if  free  standing,  but  wells  and  the 
associated  drinking  troughs  were  private  property  and  retained  by  the 
digger  season  after  season.  In  Northern  Sudan,  especially  in  the  western 
region  where  increasing  population  and  animal  numbers  placed  pressure 
on  the  land,  violations  of  customary  laws  and  conflicts  between  ethnic 
groups  over  rights  to  pasturage  and  water  increased  during  the  1990s 
and  early  2000s.  These  were  major  factors  behind  the  warfare  that  began 
in  Western  Sudan  in  early  2003. 

Agriculture 

Irrigated  Agriculture 

Sudan  had  a  modem  irrigated  agriculture  sector  totaling  about 
800,000  hectares  in  2010,  out  of  about  84  million  hectares  that  were 
potentially  arable.  This  was  a  slight  decline  from  the  prior  year  and 
well  below  the  more  than  2  million  hectares  of  the  early  1990s.  The 
Nile  and  its  tributaries  were  the  source  of  water  for  93  percent  of  irri¬ 
gated  agriculture,  and  of  this,  the  Blue  Nile  accounted  for  about  67  per¬ 
cent.  Gravity  flow  was  the  main  form  of  irrigation,  although  pumps 
served  part  of  the  irrigated  area.

The  waters  of  the  Nile  in  Sudan  were  used  for  centuries  for  tradi¬ 
tional  irrigation,  taking  advantage  of  the  annual  Nile  flood.  Such  usage 
continued  in  the  early  2000s,  along  with  the  traditional  shaduf  (a  device 
to  raise  water)  and  waterwheel  to  lift  water  to  fields  in  local  irrigation 
projects.  These  devices  were  rapidly  being  replaced  by  more  efficient 
mechanized  pumps.  Among  the  first  efforts  to  employ  irrigation  for 
modem  commercial  cropping  was  the  use  of  the  floodwaters  of  the 
Qash  River  and  the  Barakah  River  (both  of  which  originate  in  Eritrea) 
in  eastern  Sudan  to  grow  cotton  on  their  deltas.  This  project  was  started 
in  the  late  1 860s  by  the  Egyptian  governor  and  continued  until  inter¬ 
rupted  by  the  turbulent  period  of  the  1880s.  Cultivation  resumed  in 
1896  in  the  Barakah  Delta  and  after  World  War  I  in  the  Qash  Delta. 
Between  1 924  and  1 926,  canals  were  built  in  the  latter  delta  to  control 
the  flood,  but  sandstorms  made  canals  unfeasible  in  the  Barakah. 
Between  the  1940s  and  the  1970s,  various  projects  were  developed  to 
irrigate  land.  Both  deltas  yielded  only  one  crop  a  year,  watered  by  the 
flood.  Adequate  groundwater,  however,  offered  the  eventual  possibility 
of  using  pump  irrigation  from  local  wells  for  additional  cropping  or  for 
supplementing  any  flood  shortages. 

The  world’s  largest  agricultural  irrigation  project  under  single  man¬ 
agement  in  2010  operated  on  land  between  the  Blue  Nile  and  White

Nile  Rivers  south  of  their  confluence  at  Khartoum.  This  land  has  a  gen¬ 
tle  slope  to  the  north  and  west,  permitting  natural  gravity  irrigation,  and 
its  soils  are  fertile  cracking  clays  well  suited  to  irrigation.  The  project 
originated  in  1911  when  a  private  British  enterprise,  Sudan  Plantations 
Syndicate,  found  cotton  suitable  to  the  area  and  embarked  in  the  1 920s 
on  what  became  the  Gezira  Scheme,  intended  principally  to  furnish 
cotton  to  the  British  textile  industry.  Backed  by  a  loan  from  the  British 
government,  the  syndicate  began  to  construct  a  dam  on  the  Blue  Nile  at 
Sinnar  (also  seen  as  Sannar  and  Sennar)  in  1913.  Work  was  interrupted 
by  World  War  I,  and  the  dam  was  not  completed  until  1925.  The  proj¬ 
ect  was  limited  by  a  1929  agreement  between  Sudan  and  Egypt,  which 
restricted  the  amount  of  water  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Sudan  could  use 
during  the  dry  season.  By  1931  the  project  had  expanded  to  450,000 
hectares,  the  maximum  that  could  then  be  irrigated  by  the  available 
water,  although  10,000  more  hectares  were  added  in  the  1950s.  The 
project  was  nationalized  in  1950  and  operated  thereafter  by  the  Sudan 
Gezira  Board  as  a  government  enterprise.  In  1959  a  new  agreement 
with  Egypt  greatly  increased  the  allotment  of  water  to  Sudan,  as  did  the 
completion  in  the  early  1 960s  of  the  Manaqil  Extension  on  the  western 
side  of  the  Gezira  Scheme.  In  2010  the  Gezira  Scheme  accounted  for 
the  great  majority  of  the  country's  total  land  under  irrigation. 

The  government  set  up  a  program  in  the  early  1960s  to  resettle  Nubi¬ 
ans  displaced  by  Lake  Nubia  (called  Lake  Nasser  in  Egypt),  which  was 
fonned  by  the  construction  of  the  Aswan  High  Dam  in  Egypt.  To  pro¬ 
vide  farmland  for  the  Nubians,  the  government  constructed  the  Khashm 
al-Qirbah  Dam  on  the  Atbarah  River,  a  Nile  tributary,  and  established 
the  Haifa  al-Jadidah  (New  Haifa)  irrigation  project.  Located  west  of 
Kassala,  this  project  was  originally  designed  to  irrigate  about  164,000 
hectares.  Part  of  the  irrigated  area  was  assigned  to  local  inhabitants.  The 
main  commercial  crops  initially  introduced  included  cotton,  peanuts, 
and  wheat.  In  1965  sugarcane  was  added,  and  a  sugar  factory  having  a 
design  capacity  of  60,000  tonnes  was  built  to  process  it  (for  value  of  the 
metric  ton,  see  table  1,  Appendix). 

The  multipurpose  Roseires  Dam  was  built  in  1966,  power-generat¬ 
ing  facilities  being  installed  in  1971 .  Both  the  water  and  the  power  were 
needed  to  implement  the  Rahad  River  irrigation  project  located  east  of 
the  Rahad  River,  a  tributary  of  the  Blue  Nile.  Work  on  the  initial  63,000 
hectares  of  the  project  began  in  the  early  1970s,  and  the  first  irrigation 
water  was  received  in  1977.  As  of  2009-10,  the  dam  was  being  height¬ 
ened  in  order  to  increase  the  amount  of  water  for  both  irrigation  and 
power  generation. 

Private  irrigation  projects  using  diesel  pumps  also  began  to  appear  in 
Al-Khartoum  Province  in  the  1920s,  mainly  along  the  White  Nile,  to 
improve  provision  of  vegetables,  fruit,  and  other  foods  to  the  capital  area.

In  1937  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium  government  built  a  dam 
upstream  from  Khartoum  on  the  White  Nile  at  Jabal  al-Awliya  to  regulate 
the  supply  of  water  to  Egypt  during  the  August  to  April  period  of  declin¬ 
ing  flow.  Grazing  and  cultivated  land  along  the  river  was  flooded  for 
almost  300  kilometers.  The  government  thereupon  established  seven 
pump-irrigation  projects,  partially  financed  by  Egypt,  to  provide  the  area’s 
inhabitants  with  an  alternative  to  transhumance.  This  irrigation  project 
eventually  proved  successful,  making  possible  large  surpluses  of  cotton 
and  sorghum  and  encouraging  private  entrepreneurs  to  undertake  new 
projects.  High  cotton  profits  during  the  Korean  War  (1950-53)  increased 
private  interest  along  the  Blue  Nile  as  well,  and  by  1958  almost  half  the 
country's  irrigated  cotton  was  grown  under  pump  irrigation.  During  the 
1 960s,  however,  downward  fluctuations  in  world  cotton  prices  and  dis¬ 
putes  between  entrepreneurs  and  tenants  led  to  numerous  failures  of 
pump  irrigation  projects.  In  1968  the  government  established  the  Agricul¬ 
tural  Reform  Coiporation  and  assumed  ownership  and  operation  of  the 
larger  estates.  Subsequently,  as  leases  expired,  the  corporation  acquired 
smaller  projects,  until  May  1970,  when  all  outstanding  leases  were 
revoked.  A  considerable  number  of  small  pump  operations  that  devel¬ 
oped  on  privately  owned  land,  chiefly  along  the  main  Nile  but  also  on  the 
Blue  Nile,  continued  to  operate.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Since  the  1950s,  the  government  has  constructed  a  number  of  large 
pump  projects,  mostly  on  the  Blue  Nile.  These  have  included  the 
Junayd  project  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Blue  Nile  east  of  the  Gezira 
Scheme.  This  project,  with  an  irrigated  area  of  about  36,000  hectares, 
went  into  operation  in  1955  with  the  aim  of  providing  an  alternative 
livelihood  for  nomadic  pastoralists  in  the  area.  It  just  produced  cotton 
until  1960,  when  about  8,400  hectares  were  converted  to  sugarcane.  A 
sugar  factory  built  to  process  the  crop  (with  a  potential  capacity  of 
60,000  tonnes  of  sugar  a  year)  opened  in  1962.  In  the  early  1970s,  the 
As-Suki  project,  partially  funded  by  Japan  and  also  of  36,000  hectares, 
was  established  upstream  from  Sinnar  to  grow  cotton,  sorghum,  and 
oilseeds.  In  the  mid-1970s,  the  government  constructed  a  second  proj¬ 
ect  near  Sinnar  of  about  20,000  hectares.  In  addition  to  cotton  and  other 
crops  such  as  peanuts,  about  8,400  hectares  of  the  area  were  devoted  to 
raising  sugarcane.  The  cane-processing  factory,  with  a  design  capacity 
of  1 10,000  tonnes  of  sugar  a  year,  opened  in  1976.  Several  smaller  Blue 
Nile  projects  added  more  than  80,000  additional  hectares  to  Sudan's 
overall  irrigated  area  during  this  time. 

In  the  1970s,  when  the  consumption  and  import  of  sugar  grew  rap¬ 
idly,  domestic  production  became  a  priority.  Consequently,  two  major 
pump-irrigated  sugar  plantations  were  established  on  the  White  Nile  in 
the  Kosti  area.  The  Hajar  Asalaya  Sugar  Project,  begun  in  1975,  irri¬ 
gated  an  area  of  about  7,600  hectares.  A  sugar-processing  factory 
opened  in  1977,  with  a  potential  annual  capacity  of  1 10,000  tonnes.  The 
Kananah  Sugar  Project,  which  opened  in  1981  with  a  potential  of  more 
than  33,000  hectares,  was  one  of  the  world’s  largest  sugar-milling  and 
refining  operations.  The  project,  unlike  the  country’s  four  other  govern¬ 
ment-owned  sugar  projects,  was  a  joint  venture  among  the  governments 
of  Sudan,  Kuwait,  and  Saudi  Arabia,  and  the  Arab  Investment  Com¬ 
pany,  the  Sudan  Development  Corporation,  Kananah  Limited,  and  the 
Arab  Authority  for  Agricultural  Investment  and  Development;  it  also 
included  local  Sudanese  banks. 

The  government’s  Dams  Implementation  Unit  signed  contracts  in 
2010  with  two  Chinese  companies  for  a  US$838  million  project  in 
northeastern  Sudan.  The  Upper  Atbarah  Dams  Complex  Project  would 
comprise  two  dams,  on  the  Setit  and  the  Atbarah,  and  the  Upper  Nile 
Dam.  The  project  was  part  of  the  dam-construction  program  that 
included  the  building  of  the  1,250-megawatt  Merowe  Dam  and  the 
heightening  of  the  Roseires  Dam.  The  new  dams  were  expected  to  con¬ 
tribute  to  the  irrigation  of  some  210,000  hectares  of  agricultural  land 
and  to  help  revitalize  land  in  the  New  Haifa  Agricultural  Scheme.

Mechanized  Rain-fed  Agriculture 

Cultivation  dependent  on  rainfall  falls  into  two  categories.  Most  Suda¬ 
nese  farmers  had  always  relied  on  rain-fed  fanning.  In  addition  to  these 
traditional  farms,  a  large  modem  mechanized  rain-fed  agricultural  sector 
developed  after  1944-45,  when  a  government  project  to  cultivate  the 
cracking  clays  of  central  Sudan  started  in  the  area  of  Al-Gedaref  (also 
seen  as  Al-Qadarif).  Its  prime  purpose  was  to  meet  the  food  needs  of  army 
units  stationed  in  British  colonies  in  East  Africa  (present-day  Kenya,  Tan¬ 
zania,  and  Uganda).  The  alkaline  clays  and  loams  in  this  area  were  not 
suitable  for  cultivation  by  hand  or  by  oxen.  An  average  of  about  6,000 
hectares  a  year  was  cultivated  between  1945  and  1953,  chiefly  producing 
sorghum,  under  a  sharecropping  arrangement  between  the  government 
and  fanners  who  had  been  allocated  land  in  the  project.  These  estates 
proved  costly,  however,  and  in  1 954  the  government  began  encouraging 
the  private  sector  to  take  up  mechanized  fanning  in  the  area,  a  policy  that 
continued  after  Sudan  gained  independence  in  1956.  The  government 
maintained  several  state  farms  to  demonstrate  production  methods  and  to 
conduct  research,  but  research  activities  were  very  limited  because  of 
staffing  and  funding  problems. 

The  private-sector  response  was  positive,  and  by  1960  mechanized 
farming  had  spread  into  other  areas  of  the  cracking-clay  zone  in  central 


179 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


and  eastern  Sudan.  The  government  set  aside  rectangular  areas  that 
were  divided  into  plots  of  420  hectares  (later  raised  in  places  to  630 
hectares)  each.  Half  of  these  plots  were  leased  to  private  fanners,  the 
other  half  left  fallow.  After  four  years,  the  originally  leased  land  was  to 
be  returned  to  fallow  and  the  farmer  was  to  receive  a  new  lease  for  an 
adjacent  fallow  area.  When  the  demand  for  land  grew  faster  than  it 
could  be  demarcated,  areas  outside  the  designated  project  limits  were 
taken  over  by  private  individuals.  The  four-year  lease  proved  unpopu¬ 
lar  because  it  meant  new  investment  in  clearing  land  every  four  years, 
and  apparently  much  of  the  worked  land  continued  to  be  cultivated 
while  fallow  land  was  also  placed  under  cultivation. 

The  investment  requirements  for  mechanized  farming  favored  pros¬ 
perous  cultivators,  and  eventually  most  farms  came  to  be  operated  by 
entrepreneurs  who  raised  capital  through  mortgageable  property  or 
other  assets  in  the  urban  centers.  Through  arrangements  with  other 
individuals,  these  entrepreneurs  frequently  managed  to  control  addi¬ 
tional  plots  beyond  the  legal  limit  of  two.  Their  ability  to  obtain  capital 
permitted  them  also  to  abandon  depleted  land  and  to  move  into  newly 
demarcated  uncleared  areas,  a  practice  that  had  a  deleterious  impact 
on  the  environment,  deprived  the  indigenous  inhabitants  of  work 
opportunities,  and  increased  desertification.  The  government  estab¬ 
lished  the  Mechanized  Farming  Corporation  (MFC)  in  1968  as  an 
autonomous  agency  under  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Natural 
Resources,  to  expand  the  operator  base  and  to  introduce  more  control 
over  land  allocation,  crops,  and  farming  methods.  With  loans  from  the 
IDA,  the  MFC  was  able  to  provide  technical  assistance,  credit  for  land 
clearing  and  machinery,  and  marketing  aid  to  individual  farmers  and 
cooperative  groups.  The  MFC  also  became  the  operator  of  state  farms. 

The  area  under  this  system  of  management  by  the  late  1990s  had 
spread  to  about  5.9  million  hectares  in  the  states  of  Al-Gedaref,  Blue 
Nile,  Upper  Nile,  White  Nile,  Sinnar,  and  South  Kordofan.  The  farms 
were  then  usually  well  over  420  hectares  as  a  result  of  combining 
leased  plots  and  creating  family  partnerships.  The  government  also 
allocated  large  plots  of  2 1 ,000^420,000  hectares  to  Sudanese  and  Gulf 
state  investors. 

Only  a  few  crops  were  suitable  for  cultivation  in  the  cracking-clay 
area,  principally  sorghum.  Sesame  and  short-fiber  cotton  also  grew  suc¬ 
cessfully  but  in  relatively  smaller  quantities.  Land  preparation,  seeding, 
and  most  threshing  were  mechanized  on  these  farms,  but  some  thresh¬ 
ing,  as  well  as  weeding  and  harvesting,  was  done  by  seasonal  labor.

The  Economy 


Traditional  Rain-fed  Agriculture 

Traditional  rain-fed  farming  involves  nomadic  and  seminomadic 
peoples  and  transhumance,  as  well  as  settled  agriculture,  which  also 
includes  significant  numbers  of  livestock.  Although  almost  all  these 
systems  exist  in  every  state,  they  are  most  prevalent  in  the  Kordofan  and 
Darfur  States,  Sinnar,  and  the  Blue  Nile  and  White  Nile  States.  Live¬ 
stock,  part  of  almost  every  farming  system,  serve  as  both  a  capital  asset 
and  a  hedge  against  the  risk  of  farming,  particularly  because  of  recur¬ 
rent  droughts. 

Settled  farmers  usually  produce  a  combination  of  food  crops  and 
cash  crops,  such  as  karkade  (hibiscus),  sesame,  and  watermelon,  on  4.2 
to  6.3  hectares.  The  total  area  under  crops  in  the  traditional  rain-fed 
fanning  system  in  2010  was  estimated  to  be  almost  12  million  hectares. 

South  Sudan  has  three  zones  where  traditional  agricultural  systems 
prevail.  The  Central  Rainlands  Zone  in  Upper  Nile  State  receives  less 
than  800  millimeters  of  rainfall  per  year.  Vegetation  in  the  zone  is 
open  grasslands,  bush  thickets,  and  thorn  woodland  where  quick¬ 
maturing  grains  and  oilseeds  are  produced.  Semi-mechanized  farming 
has  begun  to  take  over  where  farm  size  is  large  enough  to  break  even 
on  the  investment. 

The  Flood  Plains  Zone  includes  the  remainder  of  the  Upper  Nile 
State  and  also  parts  of  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  Equatoria.  Rainfall  ranges 
from  800  to  1,000  millimeters  per  year,  concentrated  in  six  to  seven 
months.  Vegetation  is  open  grasslands  with  acacia  woodlands.  The  sudd 
(see  Glossary),  in  this  area,  is  a  permanent  or  semipermanent  swamp 
that  mainly  produces  papyrus.  Farming  takes  place  on  the  high  land;  the 
lower  land  is  the  most  important  cattle-grazing  land  in  the  South. 

The  Equatorial  Zone  includes  the  Ironstone  Plateau,  the  Central  Hills, 
and  the  Green  Belt  in  Equatoria.  Rainfall  is  usually  900-1,300  millime¬ 
ters  per  year,  concentrated  in  six  to  eight  months,  although  it  is  much 
higher  in  the  Green  Belt.  Farm  production  includes  perennial  tree  crops, 
such  as  coffee,  tea,  and  oil  palm,  and  annual  crops,  such  as  tobacco,  cot¬ 
ton,  com,  sorghum,  groundnuts,  sesame,  and  vegetables.  Tsetse-fly  infes¬ 
tation  makes  it  difficult  to  raise  livestock  in  the  area. 

Crops 

Cotton  was  traditionally  the  most  important  export  crop  and  the  major 
irrigated  crop.  The  main  types  of  cotton  grown  were  medium-staple 
Akala,  some  long-staple  Barakat,  and  a  little  long-medium  staple  Sham- 
bat  B.  A  small  amount  of  rain-fed,  short-staple  cotton  was  also  grown. 
Cotton’s  contribution  to  export  revenue  decreased  from  53  percent  in  the 
1970s  to  1  percent  in  2008.  Exports  of  cotton  provided  US$134  million 
in  earnings  in  2008  but  fell  to  an  estimated  US$40.4  million  in  2010.

Sesame  seed  became  Sudan’s  prime  agricultural  export  commodity  in 
the  mid-1990s,  and  it  was  also  used  domestically  to  produce  oil  for  cook¬ 
ing.  The  yield  varied  in  recent  years,  with  a  high  of  416,000  tonnes  in 
1996.  It  was  350,000  tonnes  in  2008  and  about  248,000  tonnes  in  2010 
because  of  a  decline  in  productivity.  Sesame  exports  earned  US$141  mil¬ 
lion  in  1996,  some  23  percent  of  export  revenues.  They  decreased  to 
US$93  million  in  2007,  constituting  1.2  percent  of  export  earnings,  but 
increased  to  US$167.3  million  in  2010. 

Gum  arabic  is  the  most  important  forest  product  of  Sudan,  which 
accounts  for  80  percent  of  the  world’s  supply.  It  is  collected  from  aca¬ 
cia  trees  in  Darfur  and  Kordofan  and  used  widely  in  industry  for  prod¬ 
ucts  ranging  from  mucilage  (for  postage  stamps),  to  foam  stabilizers, 
to  excipient  in  medicines  and  dietetic  foods.  The  Gum  Arabic  Com¬ 
pany  markets  the  product,  with  restraints  placed  on  the  right  of  any 
private  company  to  independently  export  unprocessed  gum  arabic. 
The  justification  given  for  regulating  its  sale  is  that  its  quality  would 
deteriorate  and  export  quantities  and  prices  would  decline  if  sales  were 
deregulated.  Moreover,  even  though  gum  arabic  requires  minimal  pro¬ 
cessing  and  packaging,  the  prices  received  by  producers  in  2000-200 1 
were  only  21  percent  of  world  market  prices.  Export  markets  for  it  are 
price  sensitive,  as  there  are  synthetic  substitutes  and  competition  from 
Chad,  Mauritania,  Senegal,  Mali,  and  Nigeria.  Production  in  1994-95 
was  84,000  tonnes.  It  declined  to  16,000  tonnes  by  2000  but  surpassed 
30,000  tonnes  in  2010.  Export  earnings  were  US$40  million  in  2003 
and  about  US$24  million  in  2010. 

Peanuts  were  one  of  Sudan’s  major  cash  crops  until  recently.  In  1993 
Sudan  was  the  fourth  largest  producer  in  Africa,  after  Nigeria,  Senegal, 
and  Zaire  (now  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo).  Peanuts  grow  on 
rain-fed  land  in  the  far  west  and  also  under  irrigation.  They  are  both  a 
domestic  source  of  food  and  oil  and  a  major  export.  Production  had  been 
decreasing  as  a  result  of  low  producer  prices,  low  world  market  prices, 
disease,  and  drought,  but  conditions  turned  around  in  the  early  2000s. 
Production  was  1 .2  million  tonnes  in  2003,  although  revenues  remained 
low.  Production  declined  to  716,000  tonnes  in  2008  but  rose  to  942,000 
tonnes  in  2009,  only  to  fall  to  an  estimated  549,000  tonnes  in  2010. 
Exports  provided  US$741,000  in  2007  and  some  US$200,000  in  2010. 

Sorghum  is  the  Sudanese  staple  food  crop,  but  the  yield  varies, 
depending  on  weather  conditions  and  the  amount  of  irrigated  land  used 
for  it.  Production  is  also  cyclical;  when  there  are  large  surpluses  of  the 
grain,  prices  fall,  discouraging  production  in  the  subsequent  year.  Out¬ 
put  reached  a  high  of  nearly  5.2  million  tonnes  in  2003  but  declined  to 
3.9  million  tonnes  in  2008  and  to  an  estimated  2.6  million  tonnes  in 
2010  as  production  continued  to  drop.  Exports  in  2010  realized  an  esti¬ 
mated  US$200,000.

The  Economy 


Wheat  is  also  grown  in  irrigated  areas  as  an  import  substitute.  Its 
production  varies  in  a  pattern  similar  to  that  of  sorghum,  reacting  to 
changes  in  prices.  Production  was  587,000  tonnes  in  2008  but  fell  to 
403,000  tonnes  in  2010  because  of  a  decrease  in  the  cultivated  area. 
Overall,  grain  production  (sorghum,  millet,  and  wheat)  is  insufficient 
for  rising  domestic  demand,  even  with  good  harvests  in  recent  years, 
requiring  Sudan  to  depend  upon  imports,  especially  imports  of  wheat. 

Sugar  production  began  in  the  1960s  to  replace  the  second  most  expen¬ 
sive  import  after  petroleum.  The  largest  of  the  parastatal  sugar  projects,  the 
Kananah  Sugar  Project,  opened  in  1981  and  was  important  in  eliminating 
sugar  imports  by  1986.  In  1999  plans  were  announced  for  a  large  produc¬ 
tion  facility  in  the  White  Nile  region,  with  major  funding  from  the  Chinese 
government.  Sudan  and  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  also  agreed  to 
build  a  sixth  sugar  plant.  And,  in  May  2002,  Sudan  inaugurated  a  new 
facility  at  the  state-owned  Sudan  Sugar  Company  in  New  Haifa,  which  by 
the  late  2000s  produced  60,000  tonnes  of  white  sugar  per  year.  In  2008 
sugar  cane  production  throughout  Sudan  totaled  7.5  million  tonnes. 

Livestock 

Livestock  raising  is  important  throughout  Sudan  except  in  the 
extremely  dry  areas  of  the  North  and  the  tsetse-fly-infected  area  in  the 
far  South.  It  provides  a  large  part  or  the  entire  livelihood  of  nearly  half 
the  population  of  Sudan,  mainly  in  the  traditional  fanning  sector.  In 
recent  years,  the  government  has  encouraged  commercial  livestock  pro¬ 
duction  of  camels,  goats,  sheep,  and  cattle  for  sale  abroad.  The  range  of 
offerings  in  the  sector  includes  live  animal  exports,  meat,  hides  and 
skins,  and  dairy  products. 

Livestock  is  of  increasing  importance  in  the  agricultural  economy, 
and  it  has  become  the  fastest  growing  non-oil  export  sector.  The  Arab 
states  of  the  Gulf,  especially  Saudi  Arabia,  are  the  source  of  especially 
strong  demand  for  Sudan’s  livestock. 

Sudanese  cattle  are  of  two  principal  varieties:  Baqqara  and  Nilotic. 
The  Baqqara  and  two  subvarieties  constitute  the  majority  of  the  coun¬ 
try’s  cattle.  This  breed  is  found  chiefly  in  the  western  savanna  regions 
and  in  fewer,  although  significant,  numbers  farther  to  the  east  from 
Jonglei  State  north  to  Kassala.  Nilotic  cattle  are  common  in  the  eastern 
hill  and  plains  areas  of  southern  East  Equatoria  State,  which  are  free  of 
the  tsetse  fly,  and  in  those  parts  of  West  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  Lakes,  and 
Jonglei  lying  outside  the  tsetse-fly  zone.  Because  of  periodic  rinder¬ 
pest  epidemics,  the  total  number  of  cattle  was  relatively  small  until 
about  1930.  A  vaccination  program  begun  about  that  time,  and  mass 
inoculations  during  the  succeeding  decades  resulted  in  a  great  increase 
in  numbers.

Sudan :  A  Country  Study 


In  the  vast  areas  used  by  pastoral  herders,  cattle  husbandry  is  con¬ 
ducted  in  an  economic,  cultural,  and  social  context  that  evolved  over 
generations.  This  includes  an  emphasis  on  increasing  herd  size  as  an 
investment  for  future  family  security.  Small  surpluses  (usually  bulls) 
are  available  for  subsistence  use,  exchange,  or  sale  for  local  consump¬ 
tion  or  export.  Cattle  are  also  used  for  marriage  payments  and  for  ritu¬ 
als.  Numbers  of  cattle  help  to  establish  or  increase  status  and  power  in 
a  social  system  in  which  cattle  are  the  measure  of  wealth. 

Transhumant  groups  own  most  of  the  Nilotic  variety  of  cattle,  and 
their  migrations,  related  to  the  wet  and  dry  seasons,  usually  do  not 
exceed  150-60  kilometers.  The  majority  of  Baqqara  cattle  belong  to 
the  Baqqara  Arabs,  who  were  once  largely  nomadic,  but  since  at  least 
the  early  1 900s  usually  maintained  a  settled  base  in  which  to  cultivate 
crops.  The  farmers,  their  relatives,  or  their  agents  move  the  cattle  over 
traditional  migratory  routes  northward  during  the  rainy  season  and 
southward  to  the  area  of  the  Bahr  al-Arab  as  the  dry  season  progresses. 
Migrations  in  either  direction  might  amount  to  400  kilometers. 

The  expansion  of  mechanized  rain-fed  agriculture  in  the  region 
used  by  the  Baqqara,  continued  government  efforts  to  enlarge  the  cul¬ 
tivated  area,  and  pressures  on  the  land  from  the  growing  population 
gradually  reduced  grazing  areas.  At  the  same  time,  traditional  cultural 
forces  brought  about  a  steady  increase  in  cattle  numbers.  The  result 
was  a  growing  overstock  and  pasture  depletion  until  the  outbreak  of 
civil  war  in  1983,  which  was  followed  by  the  devastating  droughts  of 
the  1980s  and  early  1990s  that  greatly  reduced  livestock  numbers 
throughout  Sudan. 

Sheep  are  herded  chiefly  by  transhumants  in  Darfur  and  Kordofan. 
Large  numbers  are  found  in  the  drier  areas  at  greater  elevations  than 
the  usual  cattle  zone.  There  were  several  breeds  but  the  predominant 
and  preferred  one  is  the  so-called  desert  sheep,  which  has  both  good 
weight  and  good  milk  yield.  Villagers  in  Al-Gedaref  and  Sinnar  also 
raise  large  numbers  of  sheep,  mostly  on  a  nonmigratory  basis.  Fodder 
comes  from  crop  residues  on  irrigated  and  rain-fed  farms  and  from 
vegetation  along  the  rivers  and  canals. 

Goats,  of  which  there  are  three  principal  breeds  (desert,  Nubian, 
and  Nilotic),  are  found  throughout  the  country  south  of  the  northern 
desert  areas.  They  are  raised  mainly  by  settled  families  for  milk  and 
meat.  Goat  meat,  although  less  popular  than  mutton,  forms  part  of  the 
diet  of  most  families,  particularly  the  poorer  ones.  Goat  milk  is  an 
important  source  of  protein,  and  many  families  in  urban  areas  keep  a 
few  goats  for  their  milk. 

Camels  are  largely  concentrated  in  the  desert  and  subdesert  regions 
of  northern  Darfur,  northern  Kordofan,  and  southern  Al-Gedaref.  They 


184 


are  kept  almost  entirely  by  nomadic  and  seminomadic  peoples,  for 
whom  the  animal  represents  the  preferred  mode  of  transport.  Camels 
are  also  important  for  milk  and  for  meat.  Camel  ownership  and  num¬ 
bers  are  sources  of  prestige  in  nomadic  societies. 

Donkeys,  horses,  and  a  small  number  of  pigs  (kept  by  such  non-Mus¬ 
lim  peoples  as  the  Nuba)  are  also  raised  in  Sudan.  Poultry  is  raised 
mainly  by  farm  families  and  villagers,  although  a  modem  sector  consist¬ 
ing  of  government  commercial  operations  and  some  semicommercial 
private  ventures  has  developed.  A  significant  poultry  industry  exists  in 
Khartoum,  and  beekeeping  has  also  been  introduced. 

In  1983  Sudan’s  more  than  50  million  animals  comprised  the  second 
largest  national  herd  in  Africa,  exceeded  only  by  that  of  Ethiopia.  By 
1 99 1  the  herd  had  been  reduced  by  perhaps  one-third  by  the  droughts  of 
the  1 980s— 9 1 ,  the  August  1988  floods  in  the  South,  described  as  the 
worst  in  Sudan's  history,  and  the  ravages  of  civil  war  in  the  South. 
Many  families  and  indeed  whole  ethnic  groups,  who  traditionally  sur¬ 
vived  on  their  cattle,  sheep,  goats,  or  camels,  lost  all  of  their  herds  and 
were  forced  to  migrate  to  the  Three  Towns  (Omdurman,  Khartoum, 
and  Khartoum  North)  in  search  of  sustenance. 

Total  livestock  production  increased  rapidly  in  the  second  half  of  the 
1990s.  The  numbers  of  sheep  quadrupled  in  the  1990s  in  response  to  the 
export  market  in  the  Gulf  states,  especially  Saudi  Arabia.  In  2000,  how¬ 
ever,  exports  were  affected  by  an  outbreak  of  Rift  Valley  fever  in  Saudi 
Arabia.  The  Saudi  government  blamed  the  problem  on  livestock 
imported  from  East  Africa,  and  Saudi  Arabia  and  other  Gulf  states  placed 


185 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


a  ban  on  imports  from  the  region,  which  had  a  severe  impact  on  Sudan’s 
livestock  sector.  By  2004,  livestock  had  rebounded  from  the  impact  of 
drought,  floods,  and  Gulf-state  import  bans,  with  sales  in  that  year  of 
US$134  million.  Another  outbreak  of  Rift  Valley  fever  caused  some 
losses  once  again  in  2007-8  and  resulted  in  temporary  import  restrictions 
against  Sudanese  livestock.  Sales  declined  to  US$80  million  in  2007,  and 
to  US$42  million  in  2008. 

Total  livestock  numbered  almost  142  million  head  in  2010,  includ¬ 
ing  nearly  42  million  cattle,  52  million  sheep,  43.4  million  goats,  and 
4.6  million  camels,  as  well  as  thousands  of  horses,  donkeys,  and  mules. 
The  same  year,  Sudan  exported  91,700  head  of  livestock  at  an  esti¬ 
mated  value  of  US$136  million.  Further  growth  of  the  sector  was  pre¬ 
dicted  as  Gulf  investors,  particularly  from  Saudi  Arabia,  had  committed 
to  investment  in  new  production  facilities. 

Fisheries 

Fishing  is  largely  carried  out  by  the  traditional  sector  for  subsistence, 
although  a  number  of  small  operators  also  use  the  country's  major  res¬ 
ervoirs  in  the  more  populated  central  region  and  the  rivers  to  catch  fish 
for  sale  locally  and  in  nearby  urban  centers.  There  are  also  some  mod¬ 
em  fishing  ventures,  mainly  on  Lake  Nubia  and  in  the  Red  Sea. 

Sudan’s  total  production  of  fish,  shellfish,  and  other  fishing  products 
had  significant  growth  in  recent  years.  Production  averaged  58,000 
tonnes  by  200 1 ,  with  estimates  by  the  then-Ministry  of  Livestock  Ser¬ 
vices  of  a  potential  yearly  catch  of  150,000  tonnes  per  annum  from 
freshwater  sources  and  10,000  tonnes  from  the  Red  Sea.  The  principal 
source  of  fish  is  the  Nile  River  system.  In  central  and  northern  Sudan, 
several  lakes  and  reservoirs  were  formed  by  the  damming  of  the  river 
and  its  branches:  the  180-kilometer  section  of  Lake  Nubia  on  the  main 
Nile  in  Sudan  and  the  reservoirs  behind  the  Roseires  and  Sinnar  dams 
on  the  Blue  Nile,  the  Jabal  al-Awliya  Dam  on  the  White  Nile,  and  the 
Khashm  al  Qirbah  Dam  on  the  Atbarah. 

Production  from  Lake  Nubia  was  initially  far  below  its  potential. 
Inhabitants  around  the  lake,  which  had  formed  gradually  in  the  1960s, 
had  no  previous  experience  in  fishing,  and  the  first  significant  com¬ 
mercial  exploitation  of  the  lake’s  resources  was  undertaken  by  the 
government’s  Fisheries  Administration.  In  1973  a  private  company 
also  started  operations.  Somewhat  later,  an  ice  plant  and  a  cold-storage 
facility  were  built  at  Wadi  Haifa  with  assistance  from  China.  China 
also  furnished  fishing  vessels  and  other  fishing  equipment.  New  cool¬ 
ing  plants  at  Khartoum  and  Atbarah  held  fish  transported  from  Wadi 
Haifa  by  railroad.  Fish  production  from  the  lake  reached  2,000  tonnes 
by  1 997-99,  but  declined  to  1 ,000  tonnes  by  2000-200 1 . 


186 


The  Economy 


The  largest  potential  source  of  freshwater  fish  is  in  the  South,  where 
the  extensive  river  network  and  flooded  areas  in  Al-Sudd  are  believed 
able  to  provide  100,000  to  300,000  tonnes  of  fish  on  a  sustained  basis. 
Estimated  production  in  2003  was  68,000  tonnes. 

The  country’s  second  source  of  fish,  the  Red  Sea  coastal  area,  was 
relatively  unexploited  until  the  late  1970s.  In  1978  the  British  Ministry 
of  Overseas  Development  began  a  joint  project  with  Sudan’s  Fisheries 
Administration  to  raise  output  by  making  boats,  motors,  and  equipment 
available  to  fishermen.  A  new  ice  plant  at  Sawakin  (also  seen  as  Suakin) 
provided  local  fishermen  with  ice  for  their  catch.  By  2000-2001,  about 
5,000  tonnes  of  fish,  shellfish  (including  pearl  oysters),  and  other  marine 
life  were  taken  annually. 

The  quantity  of  fish,  crustaceans,  and  mollusks  caught  in  Sudan  in 
recent  years  amounted  to  between  57,000  tonnes  in  2002  and  2006 
and  72,000  tonnes  in  2010.  Aquaculture  production  reached  a  high  of 
1,950  tonnes  in  2007. 

Forestry 

The  forestry  subsector  embraces  both  traditional  gatherers  of  fire¬ 
wood  and  producers  of  charcoal — the  main  sources  of  fuel  for  homes 
and  some  industries — and  a  modem  timber  and  sawmilling  industiy, 
the  latter  government-owned.  Forestry  activities  started  with  Condo¬ 
minium  rule  in  1899,  when  the  government  commissioned  an  Indian 
forester  to  produce  a  comprehensive  report  on  the  state  of  forests  in  the 
country.  As  a  result,  the  Woods  and  Forests  Ordinance  was  published 
in  1901,  and  the  Department  of  Woodlands  and  Forests  established. 
The  First  Forest  Act  replaced  the  ordinance  in  1908,  and  legislation 
continued  to  evolve  over  the  next  century. 

The  Forests  National  Corporation  (FNC)  has  coordinated  forestry 
development  in  Sudan  since  1989.  The  FNC  emphasizes  the  development 
of  a  forestry  information  system  and  planning  database  for  effective  plan¬ 
ning,  policy  analysis,  and  program  implementation. 

Extensive  areas  of  woodland  and  forest  have  been  converted  to 
agricultural  use  since  the  early  1900s.  In  2000,  however,  Sudan  still 
had  a  large  quantity  of  natural  forest,  much  of  which  remained  almost 
totally  unexploited.  The  UN  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  esti¬ 
mated  that  forest  areas,  defined  as  land  under  natural  or  planted  stands 
of  trees,  whether  productive  or  not,  occupied  61.6  million  hectares, 
25.9  percent  of  the  total  land  area.  Extensive  as  this  was,  it  represented 
a  loss  of  nearly  10  million  hectares  since  1990. 

About  one-quarter  of  the  forestland  is  located  in  the  dry  and  semi- 
arid  regions  of  northern  Sudan.  The  main  value  of  these  forests  is  as 
protection  for  the  land  against  desertification,  but  they  also  serve  as  a 


187 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


source  of  fuel  for  pastoral  peoples  in  those  regions.  The  continued 
population  pressure  on  the  land  has  resulted  in  accelerated  destruction 
of  forestland,  particularly  in  the  Sahel,  because  charcoal  remains  the 
predominant  fuel.  The  loss  of  forestland  in  the  marginal  areas  of  north¬ 
ern  Sudan,  accelerated  by  mechanized  farming  and  by  drought,  has 
resulted  in  the  steady  southward  encroachment  of  the  Sahara. 

The  productive  forest  extends  below  the  zone  of  desert  encroachment 
to  the  nation’s  southern  borders.  It  includes  the  savanna  woodlands  of 
the  central  and  western  parts  of  the  country,  which  are  dominated  by 
various  species  of  acacia,  among  them  Acacia  Senegal ,  the  principal 
source  of  gum  arabic. 

The  principal  area  of  productive  forest  and  woodland  is  in  the  more 
moist  southern  part  of  the  country.  Covering  an  area  of  more  than 
200,000  square  kilometers  and  consisting  mainly  of  broadleaf  decidu¬ 
ous  hardwoods,  it  remains  largely  undeveloped.  Timber  produced  by 
government  mills  in  the  area  includes  mahogany  for  furniture  and 
other  hardwoods  for  railroad  ties,  furniture,  and  construction. 

Plantations  established  by  the  Forestry  Administration  totaled  about 
641,000  hectares  of  both  hardwoods  and  softwoods  in  2000;  most  were 
in  southern  Sudan.  They  included  stands  of  teak  and,  in  the  higher  ele¬ 
vations  of  the  Imatong  Mountains,  exotic  pines.  Eucalyptus  stands 
were  established  in  the  irrigated  agricultural  areas  as  windbreaks  and  to 
supply  firewood.  Several  national  parks  and  game  reserves  offered 
some  protection  of  forest  and  woodland  areas. 

The  second  civil  war  of  1983-2005  disrupted  forestry  production  in 
the  South.  During  that  time,  looting  of  teak  plantations,  deforestation, 
and  forest  degradation  occurred  around  major  towns  in  Equatoria  and 
Bahr  al-Ghazal  to  a  radius  of  5-10  kilometers  as  people  sought  land 
for  subsistence  agriculture  and  for  building  poles  and  fuelwood.  Along 
the  northern  border  region  of  Upper  Nile,  there  was  large-scale  tree 
clearance  for  mechanized  rain-fed  agriculture.  However,  the  total 
impact  of  the  civil  strife  on  forests  and  wildlife  was  not  known  for  cer¬ 
tain,  as  surveys  did  not  cover  the  areas  affected  by  hostilities. 

Sudan  annually  produced  2,173,000  cubic  meters  of  industrial 
roundwood,  and  16,700,000  cubic  meters  of  fuelwood  in  1999-2001, 
as  well  as  52,000  cubic  meters  of  wood-based  panels,  and  three  tonnes 
of  paper  and  paperboard.  There  was  continued  high  demand  for  char¬ 
coal,  the  one  major  forest  product  not  dependent  on  the  South.  Because 
wood  of  any  kind  could  be  turned  into  charcoal,  the  acacia  groves  of 
the  Sahel  were  used  extensively  for  this  puipose,  with  a  resulting  rapid 
advance  of  deforestation  in  the  area.  Deforestation  throughout  the 
country  was  occurring  at  an  unsustainable  rate  approaching  2  percent  a 
year  in  the  early  2000s,  especially  in  the  northern  states  and  in  Darfur. 


188 


The  Economy 


There  is  potential  for  development  of  a  timber  industry,  as  about  30 
percent  of  South  Sudan  is  covered  with  forests  and  natural  woodlands, 
including  many  exotic  species.  Some  of  that  area  is  taken  up  by  reser¬ 
vations  under  formal  management,  owned  by  communities,  or  a  part  of 
an  official  government  forest  reserve.  The  Government  of  South  Sudan 
was  working  on  a  land  policy  and  forest  law.  In  the  meantime,  it  had 
placed  a  moratorium  on  any  extraction  of  major  forest  products. 

Industry 

Manufacturing 

The  development  of  modem  manufacturing  received  little  direct 
encouragement  in  Sudan  during  the  Condominium  period.  British  eco¬ 
nomic  policies  aimed  at  expanding  the  production  of  primary  products, 
mainly  cotton,  for  export.  Imports  and  traditional  handicraft  industries 
met  the  basic  needs  for  manufactured  goods.  Indirectly,  however,  the 
vast  Gezira  Scheme  led  to  the  construction  of  cotton  gins,  of  which 
more  than  20  were  in  operation  by  the  early  1930s.  A  secondary  devel¬ 
opment  was  the  establishment  of  several  cottonseed  oil-pressing  mills. 
During  World  War  II,  small  import-substitution  industries  arose, 
including  those  manufacturing  soap,  carbonated  drinks,  and  other  con¬ 
sumer  items.  These  operations  did  not  survive  the  competition  from 
imports  after  the  war's  end.  Foreign  private  interests  invested  in  a  few 
larger  enterprises  that  included  a  meat-processing  factory,  a  cement 
plant,  and  a  brewery,  all  opened  between  1949  and  1952. 

At  independence  the  Sudanese  government  supported  a  private-sec- 
tor  industrial  development  policy.  It  adopted  the  Approved  Enterprises 
(Concessions)  Act  of  1956,  to  encourage  private  Sudanese  and  foreign 
investment.  The  act  placed  few  restrictions  on  foreign  equity  holdings. 
By  1961,  however,  the  government  had  concluded  that  the  private  sector 
lacked  either  interest  or  funds  to  establish  certain  enterprises  important 
to  the  national  economy,  so  it  entered  the  manufacturing  field  itself.  The 
first  government  project  was  a  tannery,  which  was  followed  by  a  sugar 
factory.  In  1962  Khartoum  formed  the  Industrial  Development  Corpora¬ 
tion  to  manage  government  plants.  Several  additional  government  enter¬ 
prises  were  built  in  the  1960s,  including  a  second  sugar  factory,  two  fruit 
and  vegetable  canneries,  a  date-processing  plant,  an  onion-dehydrating 
plant,  a  milk-processing  plant,  and  a  cardboard  factory.  The  private  sec¬ 
tor  also  made  substantial  investments  then,  which  resulted  in  factories 
making  textiles  and  knitwear,  shoes,  soap,  soft  drinks,  and  flour.  Other 
private  enterprises  included  printing  facilities  and  additional  oil-pressing 
mills.  Among  the  largest  private  undertakings  was  the  foreign-fmanced 
and  foreign-built  oil  refinery  at  Port  Sudan,  which  opened  in  1964.  Well 


189 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


over  half  the  investment  in  the  private  sector  during  the  decade  came 
from  foreign  sources. 

Direct  government  participation  in  the  manufacturing  sector 
increased  dramatically  after  the  1969  military  coup  and  policies  aimed 
at  placing  the  country's  economic  development  in  government  hands, 
although  private  ownership  continued.  During  1970  and  1971,  Khar¬ 
toum  nationalized  more  than  30  private  enterprises.  In  1972,  however, 
to  counter  the  drop  in  foreign  private  investment  that  followed,  Colo¬ 
nel  la’ far  al-Numayri  announced  that  private  capital  would  again  be 
accorded  favorable  treatment,  and  the  government  passed  the  Devel¬ 
opment  and  Promotion  of  Industrial  Investment  Act  of  1972,  contain¬ 
ing  provisions  that  were  more  liberal  than  earlier  legislation. 

The  economy  remained  dependent  on  private  capital  from  devel¬ 
oped  nations,  so  the  government  incorporated  further  incentives  in  a 
1974  revision  of  the  industrial  investment  act  and  added  provisions 
against  arbitrary  nationalization.  Moreover,  in  1972  Khartoum  dena¬ 
tionalized  some  enterprises  and  returned  them  to  their  former  owners 
under  a  joint  public-private  ownership  arrangement. 

Throughout  the  1970s,  the  government  continued  to  establish  new 
public  enterprises,  some  state-owned,  others  in  conjunction  with  private 
interests,  and  some  having  foreign  government  participation,  especially 
by  the  Arab  oil-producing  states.  The  new  plants  included  three  sugar 
factories,  two  tanneries,  a  flour  mill,  and  more  than  20  textile  plants.  A 
joint  venture  with  U.S.  interests  built  Sudan’s  first  fertilizer  plant  south 
of  Khartoum,  which  was  in  operation  by  1986.  Private  investment  con¬ 
tinued,  particularly  in  textiles. 

Total  manufacturing  output  declined  in  the  1980s.  Capacity  utiliza¬ 
tion  was  as  low  as  30  percent  in  many  plants,  and  down  to  10  percent 
at  some  textile  factories  in  1997,  despite  a  ready  local  supply  of  high- 
quality  cotton.  About  85  percent  of  all  factories  in  Khartoum’s  main 
industrial  area  were  operating  below  full  capacity  in  1998.  A  shortage 
of  fuel  in  oil-fired  power  stations  in  Khartoum  caused  frequent  power 
outages,  which  forced  plant  owners  to  install  generators,  but  a  short¬ 
age  of  foreign  exchange  for  diesel  fuel  for  the  generators  kept  capacity 
utilization  low.  Obsolete  equipment,  lack  of  trained  personnel,  and 
uncompetitive  costs  also  contributed  to  the  slow  growth  of  the  sector. 

Growth  of  the  manufacturing  sector  increased  in  1998  with  the  con¬ 
struction  of  an  oil  pipeline,  a  new  refinery,  and  work  on  the  terminal  at 
Port  Sudan.  The  development  of  the  export  oil  industry  provided  for¬ 
eign  exchange  for  imported  machinery.  Reforms  in  the  financial  sector 
and  privatization  also  contributed  to  growth.  Telecommunications  and 
food  processing,  especially  sugar  refining,  gained  from  these  changes, 
as  well  as  from  increased  foreign  investment.  The  manufacturing  sector 
grew  by  6  percent  in  real  terms  in  1999,  by  1 1 .5  percent  in  2000,  and  by 


190 


The  Economy 


5.7  percent  in  2008,  although  it  began  from  a  low  base.  The  govern¬ 
ment’s  1997  economic  reform  program  facilitated  this  growth. 

Food  processing  was  the  most  successful  category  of  investment, 
especially  sugar  refining.  Production  of  refined  sugar  exceeded  domestic 
demand,  allowing  Sudan  to  become  the  Arab  world’s  only  net  sugar 
exporter.  There  are  five  government-owned  sugar  producers,  but  the 
leading  producer  is  the  Kananah  Sugar  Company,  the  major  part  of 
which  is  privately  owned.  Its  success  attracted  investment  in  the  White 
Nile  Sugar  Company,  which  began  production  in  201 1  and  was  expected 
to  reach  full  capacity  of 450,000  tonnes  per  year  by  2012.  A  new  refinery 
designed  to  produce  1 00,000  tonnes  per  year  was  also  being  planned  in 
Sinnar  State.  The  production  of  sugar  reached  738,500  tonnes  per  year  in 
2009  but  fell  to  642,000  tonnes  in  2010. 

Government  estimates  suggest  that  the  textile  industry,  which  uses 
domestic  cotton,  could  produce  1 1 0  percent  of  Sudanese  requirements 
if  it  operated  at  full  capacity.  There  are  75  small,  privately  owned 
companies  and  nine  large  state-owned  factories  producing  spun  yam 
and  fabric.  The  largest  factory  is  the  government-owned  Friendship 
Textile  Mill  built  by  the  Chinese  in  the  1960s,  with  a  capacity  of  2,100 
tonnes  of  yam  per  day  and  16  million  meters  of  fabric  per  year.  The 
most  important  private-sector  factory  is  the  Sudan  Textile  Industries, 
with  a  capacity  of  64  million  meters  per  year.  Although  Sudan  is  an 
important  producer  of  high-quality  cotton,  textile  production  declined 
continuously  from  274  million  meters  in  the  1970s  to  just  13.72  mil¬ 
lion  meters  in  2003,  a  capacity-utilization  rate  of  just  5  percent. 

Work  began  on  the  Red  Sea  Free-Trade  Zone  between  Port  Sudan 
and  the  port  of  Sawakin  in  July  1999.  The  project  was  designed  to 
cover  600  square  kilometers.  The  initial  zone  of  26  square  kilometers 
included  a  warehouse  and  industrial  and  commercial  areas.  The  origi¬ 
nal  investors  were  from  Qatar,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  the  UAE.  In  January 
2000,  a  cooperation  agreement  was  signed  between  the  Red  Sea  Free- 
Trade  Zone  and  the  Free-Trade  Zone  of  Jebel  Ali,  UAE,  in  which  the 
UAE  pledged  to  help  Sudan  establish  free-trade  zones  in  all  of  its  bor¬ 
der  areas,  thus  linking  trade  between  East  Asia  and  Africa  via  Sudan. 
The  UAE  also  promised  to  increase  marketing  and  shipping  activities 
and  to  exchange  personnel  and  technical  information.  Saudi  Arabia’s 
Jiddah  Free-Trade  Zone  signed  a  similar  agreement.  The  Red  Sea  Free- 
Trade  Zone  was  opened  in  February  2000.  Two  years  later,  however, 
there  were  reports  that  only  seven  of  the  factories  in  the  zone  were  still 
functioning;  since  then,  the  zone  apparently  has  collapsed. 

In  October  2000,  the  US$450  million  GIAD  industrial  city  opened 
40  kilometers  south  of  Khartoum.  As  of  2010,  it  had  13  separate  com¬ 
panies,  including  factories  for  manufacturing  cables,  electrical  wires, 


191 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


steel,  and  pipeline  products.  It  also  had  large  arms-manufacturing  and 
automotive-manufacturing  industries.  Other  factories  assembled  small 
autos  and  trucks,  and  some  heavy  military  equipment  such  as  armored 
personnel  carriers  and  the  proposed  “Bashir”  battle  tank.  The  town  also 
had  housing,  health,  and  education  facilities. 

There  are  other  small-scale  manufacturing  sectors  in  Sudan.  They 
include  pharmaceuticals,  electrical  goods,  cement,  textiles,  and  paints. 

Energy 

The  chief  sources  of  energy  in  2010  were  wood  and  charcoal, 
hydroelectric  power,  and  oil.  Wood  and  charcoal  were  principally  used 
for  household  cooking  and  heating.  Substantial  quantities  of  wood 
fuels  were  also  used  by  commercial  operations — chiefly  baking  and 
brick  making  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  tobacco  curing.  Other  vegetable 
matter  including  sugarcane  bagasse  also  came  into  use,  meeting  a  sig¬ 
nificant  part  of  the  energy  needs  of  the  sugar  mills.  Cotton  stalks  were 
also  used  for  household  fuel.  Consumption  of  wood  and  charcoal  con¬ 
tinued  to  increase  as  the  population  grew,  and  there  was  concern  over 
the  gradual  depletion  of  forest  and  woodland  resources  serving  the 
large  towns.  Overuse  of  the  sparser  vegetation  in  the  semidesert  graz¬ 
ing  areas  reportedly  resulted  in  some  fuel  deficiencies  in  those  regions, 
as  well  as  in  desertification. 

A  search  for  oil  in  the  early  1960s  along  the  Red  Sea  coast  also  dis¬ 
covered  natural  gas.  In  the  mid-1970s,  additional  oil  explorations 
revealed  more  gas  finds,  but  development  was  not  considered  at  the  time 
to  be  commercially  feasible.  In  October  1988,  Sudan  announced  that 
natural  gas  production  would  start  in  one  year.  Although  it  was  esti¬ 
mated  in  2002  that  there  were  3  billion  cubic  feet  of  natural  gas  reserves, 
production  had  not  yet  begun  by  2010. 

Electricity  generation  began  in  1 908  when  a  private  company  con¬ 
structed  the  first  power  station  at  Burri  al-Daralsa  near  Khartoum.  The 
modem  system  dates  from  1925  with  the  establishment  of  the  Sudan 
Light  and  Power  Company,  an  enterprise  financed  and  managed  by 
British  entrepreneurs  but  owned  by  the  Condominium  government. 
This  company,  acquired  in  full  by  the  colonial  government  in  1952, 
was  the  precursor — through  several  name  changes  and  reorganiza¬ 
tions— of  the  National  Electricity  Corporation  (NEC). 

The  Sinnar  and  Roseires  dams  were  originally  constructed  to  provide 
irrigation,  Sinnar  in  1925  and  Roseires  in  1966  (see  fig.  11).  Electric- 
power  generating  facilities  were  added  only  when  increasing  consumer 
demands  made  them  potentially  viable.  The  first  hydropower  station 
began  operating  at  the  Sinnar  Dam  in  1962,  and  a  transmission  line  car¬ 
ried  power  to  the  Khartoum  area.  The  main  hydropower  station  began 


192 


The  Economy 


producing  electricity  in  1973  at  the  Roseires  Dam  on  the  Blue  Nile, 
approximately  315  miles  southeast  of  Khartoum.  A  plan  for  electricity 
production  over  the  next  25  years  evaluated  the  potential  for  hydro-gen¬ 
eration  on  the  Nile  River  and  the  locations  for  electricity  generation. 

The  National  Electricity  Corporation  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy 
and  Dams  are  responsible  for  generation  and  supply  of  electricity  in 
Sudan’s  two  interconnected  grids,  the  Blue  Nile  Grid  and  the  small 
Western  Grid,  although  they  cover  only  a  small  portion  of  the  country 
around  Khartoum  and  south  to  Blue  Nile  State,  areas  that  include  only 
about  30  percent  of  the  population.  Even  in  those  areas,  the  supply  is 
inadequate,  with  output  around  500  megawatts  for  much  of  the  2000- 
2010  period,  far  below  the  demand  for  electric  power,  and  unreliable; 
power  outages  were  common,  even  in  the  capital.  As  a  result,  power 
production  is  dependent  on  small  diesel-fired  power  stations  and  con¬ 
sumers’  oil-driven  generators. 

Sudan  relies  heavily  on  hydroelectricity.  In  2006,  the  country  had 
total  installed  capacity  of  4,520  gigawatt-hours  (about  115  kilowatt- 
hours  per  head),  41  percent  of  which  was  provided  by  hydropower  sta¬ 
tions.  As  a  result,  power  tended  to  fluctuate  according  to  the  flow  of 
the  Nile.  Until  recently,  the  Roseires  Dam  was  the  largest  of  the  hydro¬ 
electric  facilities,  with  smaller  ones  existing  elsewhere  on  the  Blue 
Nile  and  the  Atbarah  River. 

The  sector  deteriorated  in  the  1 990s  because  of  a  lack  of  funding.  In 
2000,  however,  the  NEC  launched  the  Rehabilitation  and  Performance 
Improvement  Program  supported  by  a  US$10  million  loan  from  the 
OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  to  upgrade  the  existing  infra¬ 
structure  and  improve  the  reliability  of  the  electricity  supply.  In  2001  the 
NEC  announced  that  Sudan  and  Ethiopia  had  agreed  to  link  their  power 
grids,  and  a  related  report  announced  that  Ethiopia  had  also  agreed  to 
export  power  to  Sudan. 

In  January  2010,  a  contract  was  awarded  to  Norplan,  a  Norwegian 
organization,  to  design  three  new  power  stations  on  tributaries  of  the 
Nile  in  Ethiopia.  This  project  would  come  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Nile  Basin  Initiative,  an  organization  promoting  water  cooperation 
among  the  Nile  Basin  countries.  Ethiopia,  Egypt,  and  Sudan  would 
contribute  to  the  cost  of  the  power  stations,  and  the  electricity  would 
be  shared  among  the  three  countries.  The  stations  were  to  be  built  at 
Kara  Dubi  (1,600  megawatts),  Mendia  (2,000  megawatts)  and  Bako 
Ambo  (2,100  megawatts).  The  Ethiopian  Electric  Power  Corporation 
was  expected  to  be  the  main  contractor,  but  Asian  companies  such  as 
the  Chinese  firms  that  constructed  the  Merowe  Dam  were  also  likely 
to  be  involved.  Construction  work  on  a  high-voltage  electricity  con¬ 
nection  between  Sudan  and  Ethiopia  had  already  begun.

Several  newly  completed  projects  have  increased  installed  capacity. 
The  257-megawatt  diesel  power  station  constructed  by  a  Malaysian- 
led  consortium  outside  Khartoum  became  operational  in  2004.  The 
Chinese  firm  Harbin  Power  Engineering  Company  built  another  power 
station  near  Al-Jayli  refinery  north  of  Khartoum  (see  Foreign  Invest¬ 
ment,  this  ch.). 

The  largest  projects  are  the  Kajbar  and  Merowe  hydroelectric  facili¬ 
ties.  The  Kajbar  Dam,  on  the  second  cataract  of  the  Nile,  has  a  planned 
capacity  of  300  megawatts.  Sudan  and  China  signed  an  agreement  to 
build  the  dam  in  1997,  with  China  financing  75  percent  of  the  project 


194 


The  Economy 


(approximately  US$200  million),  but  construction  had  not  yet  started 
by  January  2011.  Environmental  groups  have  been  concerned  about 
potential  damage  to  the  Nile  ecosystem  and  the  culture  of  the  displaced 
Nubian  residents. 

The  1,250-megawatt  Merowe  Dam,  the  most  ambitious  project,  is 
located  about  350  kilometers  north  of  Khartoum  on  the  fourth  cataract  of 
the  Nile.  The  Dams  Implementation  Unit  (DIU),  a  public  body  that 
reports  to  the  presidency,  was  established  in  2005,  primarily  to  oversee 
construction  of  the  dam.  The  China  International  Water  and  Electric  Com¬ 
pany  was  the  main  contractor  for  construction  of  the  dam,  and  Harbin 
Power  agreed  to  build  seven  substations  and  approximately  1 ,6 1 0  kilome¬ 
ters  of  transmission  lines.  Two  consortia  of  Chinese,  Greek,  and  Italian 
firms  bid  for  the  contract  to  build  three  packages  of  the  civil  works  portion 
of  the  dam,  which  was  estimated  to  cost  US$1.9  billion.  Several  Arab 
funds  (including  the  Arab  Fund  for  Economic  and  Social  Development, 
the  Abu  Dhabi  Fund  for  Development,  the  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Eco¬ 
nomic  Development,  and  the  Saudi  Fund  for  Development)  agreed  to  pro¬ 
vide  US$600  million  in  concessional  funding.  The  dam  should  more  than 
double  previous  production  after  extensive  investment  in  the  two  inter¬ 
locking  national  grids  and  transmission  systems.  The  project  is  also 
expected  to  create  a  large,  new  area  of  cultivable  land,  although  it  has 
already  required  evacuation  of  tens  of  thousands  of  residents  from  the  res¬ 
ervoir  area.  The  project  also  included  other  major  construction  work, 
including  an  international  airport  at  Merowe,  a  bridge  over  the  Nile  at 
Kuraymah,  and  upgrading  the  local  railroad  line.  In  March  2009,  Presi¬ 
dent  al-Bashir  attended  a  ceremony  to  inaugurate  the  tenth  and  final  elec¬ 
tricity  unit  at  the  power  station,  which  brought  the  Merowe  Dam  up  to  its 
full  generation  capacity.  Its  completion  helped  account  for  Sudan’s  total 
power  generation  of  7,653.3  gigawatts  per  hour  in  2010,  of  which  81.0 
percent  (6,199.3  gigawatts)  came  from  hydropower. 

Other  projects  in  the  program  to  increase  output  included  a  planned 
doubling  of  capacity  at  the  oil-fired  Khartoum  North  power  plant,  the 
construction  of  a  500-megawatt  oil-fired  power  station  in  Kosti  in  White 
Nile  state,  construction  of  a  dam  on  the  Setit  tributary  of  the  Atbarah 
River  in  eastern  Sudan,  and  further  construction  to  heighten  the  Roseires 
Dam  on  the  Blue  Nile  in  order  to  double  its  electricity-generating  capac¬ 
ity  to  560  megawatts.  The  DIU  also  had  plans  for  water-harvesting  proj¬ 
ects  in  North  Kordofan  (a  state  that  has  no  year-round  flowing  rivers), 
and  proposals  to  build  dams  and  water  reservoirs  in  Sodiri,  Al-Nuhud, 
and  Hamrat  al-Sheikh.  There  was  no  significant  power-generating  capac¬ 
ity  in  the  South  or  West  in  2010,  although  there  were  plans  for  hydroelec¬ 
tric  projects  and  the  electrification  of  20  Southern  towns  with  local 
diesel-powered  grids,  as  well  as  for  the  extension  of  the  national  grid  in 
the  North  to  Darfur  and  Kordofan.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


In  January  2010,  Taqa  Arabia  of  Egypt  entered  a  joint  venture  with 
ASEC  Cement  of  Egypt  and  the  Sudanese  Pension  Fund  to  build  a  42- 
megawatt  power  station  to  provide  electricity  for  the  Takamol  cement 
plant  being  built  by  ASEC  at  Atbarah,  200  kilometers  north  of  Khar¬ 
toum.  The  cement  plant  had  a  capacity  of  1.6  million  tonnes  a  year  to 
help  meet  demand  from  the  construction-related  boom  in  and  around 
Khartoum. 

Mining 

The  mining  industry  contributed  little  to  GDP  until  the  discovery  of 
commercially  exploitable  quantities  of  petroleum  in  the  late  1970s 
offered  hope  that  the  sector  would  play  an  increased  role  in  the  economy 
in  the  future.  Nonhydrocarbon  minerals  of  actual  or  potential  commer¬ 
cial  value  include  gold,  chrome,  copper,  iron  ore,  manganese,  asbestos, 
gypsum,  mica,  limestone,  marble,  uranium,  silver,  lead,  talc,  tungsten, 
zinc,  and  diamonds. 

Gold  mining  in  the  Red  Sea  Hills  began  in  pharaonic  times.  Between 
1900  and  1954,  several  British  enterprises  worked  gold  mines  in  the  area 
and  extracted  a  considerable  quantity  of  the  metal — one  mine  alone 
reportedly  produced  three  tonnes  of  gold  between  1924  and  1936.  Gold 
was  also  mined  along  the  borders  between  Sudan  and  Uganda  and  Zaire, 
but  not  in  amounts  that  were  commercially  profitable.  During  the  1970s, 
the  government's  Geological  Survey  Administration  located  more  than 
50  potential  gold  deposits  in  different  parts  of  the  country.  In  recent 
years,  most  gold  mining  has  resulted  from  joint  ventures  with  Chinese  or 
French  companies.  According  to  the  government,  gold  mining  amounted 
to  about  three  tonnes  per  year  as  of  the  early  2000s,  but  output  was 
declining  steadily  as  reserves  became  depleted.  Reserves  were  then  esti¬ 
mated  at  32  tonnes,  concentrated  around  the  Red  Sea  Hills. 

Chrome  ore  is  mined  in  the  Ingessana  Hills  southwest  of  Al- 
Damazin.  By  1983,  when  the  civil  war  brought  a  halt  to  mining  there, 
chrome  production  had  declined  from  a  high  of  20,000  tonnes  per  year 
to  half  that  amount.  By  1994  it  had  declined  to  3,000  tonnes  per  year, 
but  by  2004  it  had  climbed  to  an  estimated  24,000  tonnes.  Production  in 
2010  amounted  to  56,800  tonnes.  Reserves  are  estimated  to  be  1  million 
tonnes.  Asbestos  of  good  commercial  grade  is  also  found  in  the  Inges¬ 
sana  Hills  area. 

The  Sudan  Mining  Corporation  (SMC)  produced  about  20,000 
tonnes  of  gypsum  annually  in  the  early  2000s  from  a  quarry  in  the  Red 
Sea  Hills,  with  an  estimated  500  million  tonnes  of  reserves,  and  there 
has  also  been  some  mining  of  limestone,  marble,  mica,  manganese, 
and  iron  ore.  Uranium  ores  were  discovered  in  the  area  of  the  Nuba 
Mountains  and  at  Hufrat  al-Nahhas  in  South  Kordofan,  and  they  might

also  exist  near  the  western  borders  with  Chad  and  the  Central  African 
Republic.  Other  untapped  deposits  of  minerals  include  lead,  talc,  tung¬ 
sten,  and  diamonds. 

Another  potential  source  of  mineral  wealth  is  the  Red  Sea  bed, 
where  zinc,  silver,  copper,  iron,  and  other  minerals  were  discovered. 
Explorations  below  the  2,000-meter  mark  indicate  that  large  quantities 
of  the  minerals  are  present. 

Petroleum 

Prior  to  the  discovery  of  oil,  roughly  80  percent  of  the  nation's 
energy  requirement  for  industry,  modem  agriculture,  transportation, 
government  services,  and  households  (in  addition  to  fuelwood,  char¬ 
coal,  and  the  like)  came  from  imported  petroleum  and  petroleum  prod¬ 
ucts.  Approximately  1 0  percent  of  those  imports  were  used  to  generate 
electricity.  Foreign-exchange  costs  for  oil  imports  rose  dramatically 
after  1973.  The  discovery  of  domestic  petroleum  deposits  at  the  end  of 
the  1970s  and  during  the  early  1980s  thus  promised  to — and  eventu¬ 
ally  did — lessen  the  dependence  on  expensive  external  sources. 

The  search  for  oil  began  in  1 959  in  the  Red  Sea  littoral  and  continued 
intermittently  into  the  1970s.  In  1974  the  U.S.  firm  Chevron  began 
exploration  in  southern  and  southwestern  Sudan.  Drilling  began  in  1977, 


197 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


and  the  first  commercial  flow  started  in  July  1979  at  Abu  Jabrah  in 
South  Darfur.  In  1980  major  finds  occurred  at  the  company’s  Unity 
Field  near  Bentiu;  by  early  1981,  drilling  had  brought  in  49  wells  having 
a  combined  flow  of  more  than  12,000  barrels  per  day  (b/d).  Other  oil 
companies — including  some  from  the  United  States,  Canada,  and 
France — also  obtained  concessions,  and  by  1982  almost  one-third  of 
Sudan  had  been  assigned  for  exploration.  Oil  exploration  and  production 
were  hampered,  however,  by  the  almost  total  lack  of  infrastructure  and 
by  the  civil  war  in  the  South. 

The  domestic  processing  of  crude  petroleum  began  in  late  1964, 
when  the  Port  Sudan  oil  refinery  went  into  operation.  The  refinery, 
which  was  financed,  built,  and  managed  by  the  British  Petroleum  and 
Royal  Dutch  Shell  companies — from  July  1976  as  a  joint-equal  share¬ 
holding  project  with  the  government — had  a  capacity  of  about  21,440 
barrels  per  day.  Its  capacity  was  well  in  excess  of  Sudan's  needs  at  the 
time  it  was  built,  and  refined  products  were  exported.  As  domestic 
demand  increased  in  the  1980s,  and  with  new  petroleum  discoveries, 
several  plans  were  developed  for  a  new  oil  refinery  and  an  export  pipe¬ 
line.  By  1986,  however,  those  plans  had  been  cancelled.  Sudan  had  to 
import  both  gas  oil  (used  in  diesel  motors  and  for  heating)  and  kero¬ 
sene  for  domestic  use,  although  a  substantial  quantity  of  other  products 
refined  by  the  plant,  in  excess  of  Sudan’s  own  needs,  continued  to  be 
exported. 

Further  seismic  studies  were  undertaken  in  the  swamps  of  Al-Sudd, 
but  all  of  Chevron's  exploration  and  development  activities  came  to  an 
abrupt  end  in  February  1984,  when  rebels  attacked  the  main  Chevron 
base  across  the  Bahr  al-Ghazal  from  Bentiu,  killing  four  Chevron 
employees.  The  company  immediately  terminated  its  development 
program  and,  despite  repeated  demands  by  successive  Sudanese  gov¬ 
ernments,  refused  to  return  to  work  its  concession  until  the  safety  of  its 
personnel  could  be  guaranteed  by  a  settlement  of  the  Sudanese  civil 
war.  Total,  the  French  oil  company,  shut  down  its  operations  several 
months  later. 

The  Canadian  firm  Arakis  bought  the  Chevron  concession  in  the 
Muglad  basin,  north  of  Bentiu,  and  in  March  1997  formed  a  consor¬ 
tium,  the  Greater  Nile  Petroleum  Operating  Company  (GNPOC),  with 
the  China  National  Petroleum  Corporation  (CNPC),  the  Malaysian  state 
oil  company  Petroliam  Nasional  Berhad  (PETRONAS),  and  the  pub¬ 
licly  owned  Sudan  National  Petroleum  Corporation  (Sudapet).  In  1998 
another  Canadian  firm,  Talisman  Energy,  purchased  the  share  of  Arakis 
and  then,  under  pressure  from  international  nongovernmental  organiza¬ 
tions  (which  were  opposed  to  the  Islamist  regime  in  Khartoum),  sold  it 
to  a  state-owned  Indian  oil  company  in  2003.  Other  companies  that  also 


198

invested  in  concessions  included  the  Qatar-based  Gulf  Petroleum  and 
the  French  oil  company  Total.  The  Swedish  company  Lundin  Oil  and 
the  Austrian  finn  OMV  were  also  involved,  but  both  withdrew  from  the 
country  because  of  deteriorating  security  conditions. 

Prior  to  2005,  the  only  concession  producing  petroleum  was  GNPOC. 
However,  many  other  fields  were  under  development,  such  as  the  conces¬ 
sion  being  developed  by  the  consortium  led  by  CNPC,  PETRONAS, 
Sudapet,  Sinopec,  and  Cairo-based  Tri-Ocean  Energy.  In  2003  and  2004, 
the  consortium  began  construction  of  a  new  export  pipeline  and  export 
terminal,  as  well  as  in-field  production  and  transportation  facilities.  South 
Sudan’s  national  oil  company,  Nile  Petroleum  Corporation  (Nilepet),  was 
also  involved  in  allocating  licenses. 

In  2005  Sudan  established  the  National  Petroleum  Commission  to 
improve  the  development  of  the  country’s  oil  resources.  The  commis¬ 
sion  allocates  new  oil  contracts  and  ensures  equal  sharing  of  oil  revenues 
between  the  national  government  in  Khartoum  and  the  Government  of 
South  Sudan  (GOSS).  It  also  resolved  duplicate  oil  contract  issues  in 
which  the  GOSS  allocated  blocks  that  overlapped  the  contracts  previ¬ 
ously  granted  by  the  national  government  in  Khartoum. 

Intensive  exploration  by  GNPOC  resulted  in  known  reserves  of  800 
million  barrels  in  2004.  At  that  time,  however,  studies  suggested  that 


199 


Sudan:  A  Conn  tty  Study 


production  might  eventually  increase  to  more  than  4  billion  barrels,  with 
recovery  rates  of  30-35  percent,  and  generate  total  oil  income  of  about 
US$30  billion.  Exploration  was  expected  to  continue  not  only  in  the 
South,  but  also  in  the  North  near  Dongola,  the  East  around  Port  Sudan, 
the  West,  and  also  offshore.  As  of  2009,  proven  oil  reserves  increased  to 
5  billion  barrels,  and  there  were  proven  natural  gas  reserves  of  3  trillion 
cubic  feet,  although  there  was  no  production  of  natural  gas  by  early 
2011.  The  majority  of  the  reserves  were  in  South  Sudan. 

Additional  refining  capacity  became  essential  as  oil  production 
increased.  A  US$600  million  refinery  at  Al-Jayli,  north  of  Khartoum, 
came  online  in  mid-2000  with  a  capacity  of  around  60,000  b/d,  which 
allowed  Sudan  to  become  self-sufficient  in  refined  products.  The  export 
pipeline,  which  passed  close  to  it,  provided  the  resources  for  the  refin¬ 
ery,  which  also  produces  a  small  surplus  of  refined  goods,  especially 
benzine,  for  export. 

In  addition  to  the  refineries  at  Al-Jayli  and  Port  Sudan,  there  are 
also  some  smaller  refineries.  They  include  Al-Obeid,  with  a  capacity 
of  15,000  b/d,  Abu  Jabrah,  with  a  capacity  of  about  2,000  b/d,  and  a 
topping  plant  built  by  Concorp  with  a  capacity  of  5,000  b/d. 

Refining  capacity  increased  in  July  2006  as  CNPC  completed  the 
expansion  of  the  Al-Jayli  refinery  north  of  Khartoum  to  100,000  b/d.  An 
Indian  energy  company,  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation  (ONGC),  had 
a  contract  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  40-year-old  Port  Sudan  refinery 
from  21,000  b/d  to  70,000  b/d,  while  PETRONAS  was  awarded  a  $1 
billion  joint  venture  with  the  government  to  build  a  second  100,000  b/d 
refinery  in  Port  Sudan  to  process  the  new  Dar  Blend  crude  from  its 
Melut  concession  in  southeastern  Sudan.  This  project  had  been  post¬ 
poned  several  times  by  2010,  however,  and  its  status  is  unknown. 
Among  other  developments,  Malaysia’s  Peremba  has  begun  construc¬ 
tion  of  a  marine  export  terminal,  with  a  capacity  of  2  million  b/d,  known 
as  the  Melut  Basin  Oil  Development  Project. 

Domestic  production  of  petroleum  was  about  480,000  b/d  in  2008, 
and  consumption  was  approximately  86,000  b/d,  with  the  remaining 
394,000  b/d  exported  to  Asian  markets,  the  majority  to  China,  Japan, 
and  Indonesia.  Most  of  the  oil  was  exported  as  crude,  although  some 
refined  products  were  also  exported.  Sudanese  Nile  Blend  oil  is  a 
medium,  sweet  crude,  with  low  sulphur  and  metal  content.  It  is  sold  at 
a  discount  to  the  Indonesian  blend,  Minas,  the  medium-sweet  bench¬ 
mark  in  Asia.  Dar  Blend  is  also  exported  to  Asian  markets,  but  its 
heavy,  sour  quality  causes  it  to  trade  at  a  discount,  often  severe,  to 
Minas  crude.  There  has  been  a  continuing  trend  of  declining  output  of 
Nile  Blend  oil  and  increasing  output  of  the  less  valuable  Dar  Blend, 
although  total  output  remains  relatively  steady.  The  shift  from  Nile  to 


200 


The  Economy 


Dar,  however,  means  that  a  larger  share  of  Sudan’s  oil  is  being  pro¬ 
duced  in  the  South,  about  78  percent. 

Sudan’s  minister  for  energy  and  mining  indicated  in  May  2010  that 
there  might  be  modest  output  increases  over  the  next  several  years.  He 
also  indicated,  however,  that  the  recoverable  reserves  in  the  existing 
fields,  using  current  technology,  were  only  about  1.6  billion  barrels, 
less  than  a  decade  of  production  at  current  output  rates,  and  that  pro¬ 
duction  at  those  fields  would  only  be  a  quarter  of  their  current  level  by 
2019.  He  was  confident,  however,  that  new  recovery  technology  could 
increase  the  amount  recoverable  from  the  fields  and  that  new  fields 
would  be  discovered.  He  also  was  confident  that  production  of  natural 
gas  would  occur  by  that  time. 

Satellite  photographs  were  available  in  201 1  that  provided  evidence 
of  oil  exploration  taking  place  in  North  Darfur,  although  the  consor¬ 
tium  of  Arab  companies  holding  the  concession  had  not  confirmed  the 
exploration  or  indicated  whether  oil  was  discovered  there.  This  region 
has  geological  connections  to  the  oil-producing  regions  in  southeastern 
Libya. 

In  May  2006,  Sudan  was  invited  to  become  a  voting  member  of 
OPEC.  The  country  had  had  observer  status  since  1999  and  was  now 
qualified  to  join  OPEC  according  to  conditions  set  by  the  organiza¬ 
tion,  although  as  of  201 1  it  had  not  yet  become  a  member. 

Transportation  and  Telecommunications 

Sudan’s  transport  infrastructure  in  the  early  2000s  included  an 
extensive  railroad  system  that  served  the  more-important  populated 
areas  except  in  the  far  South,  a  rudimentary  road  network  (very  little  of 
which  consists  of  paved,  all-weather  roads),  a  natural  inland  waterway 
(the  Nile  River  and  its  tributaries),  a  national  airline  that  furnishes  inter¬ 
national  as  well  as  domestic  services,  and  several  private  charter  air¬ 
lines.  Complementing  this  infrastructure  were  Port  Sudan  and  Sawakin, 
two  major  deep-water  ports  on  the  Red  Sea,  and  a  small  national  mer¬ 
chant  marine.  Additionally,  a  pipeline  transporting  petroleum  products 
extended  from  Port  Sudan  to  Khartoum  and  another  pipeline  carried 
petroleum  from  the  oil  fields  in  the  south-central  area  to  the  oil-export 
terminal  near  Port  Sudan  on  the  Red  Sea.  Overall,  however,  the  trans¬ 
portation  infrastructure  was  inadequate  and  constituted  a  major  obstacle 
to  economic  development. 

Railroads 

The  first  segment  of  present-day  Sudan  Railways,  from  Wadi  Haifa 
to  Abu  Hamad,  was  built  by  the  British  for  use  in  General  Herbert

Kitchener’s  drive  against  the  Mahdiyyah  in  the  late  1890s.  The  line 
reached  Atbarah  during  the  campaign  and,  after  the  defeat  ot  the  Mah¬ 
diyyah  in  1898,  extended  to  Khartoum.  The  line  was  built  to  1.07- 
meter-gauge  track,  the  result  apparently  of  Kitchener’s  pragmatic  use 
of  the  rolling  stock  and  rails  of  that  gauge  from  an  older  line.  This 
gauge  was  used  in  all  later  Sudanese  mainline  construction. 

The  rail  line  opened  a  trade  route  from  central  Sudan  through  Egypt 
to  the  Mediterranean  and  beyond.  It  became  uneconomical,  however, 
because  of  the  distance  and  the  need  for  transshipment  via  the  Nile.  In 
1904  construction  began  on  a  new  line  from  Atbarah  to  the  Red  Sea.  In 
1906  the  new  line  reached  recently  built  Port  Sudan  to  provide  a  direct 
connection  between  Khartoum  and  ocean-going  transport.  During  the 
same  decade,  a  new  line  connected  Khartoum  southward  to  Sinnar,  the 
heart  of  the  cotton-growing  region.  A  westward  continuation  reached 
Al-Obeid  in  1911,  when  it  was  the  second  largest  city  and  center  of 
gum  arabic  production.  In  the  north,  a  branch  line  that  tied  the  naviga¬ 
ble  stretch  of  the  Nile  between  the  fourth  and  third  cataracts  into  the 
transport  system  was  built  from  near  Abu  Hamad  to  Kuraymah. 

In  the  mid-  and  late  1920s,  a  spur  of  the  railroad  linked  Taqatu 
Hayya,  a  point  on  the  main  line  200  kilometers  southwest  of  Port 
Sudan,  southward  to  the  cotton-producing  area  near  Kassala,  then  on  to 
the  grain  region  of  Al-Gedaref,  and  finally  to  a  junction  with  the  main 
line  at  Sinnar.  An  extension  connected  Sinnar  to  Al-Damazin  on  the 
Blue  Nile.  Additional  construction  in  the  1950s  included  an  extension 
of  the  western  line  to  Nyala  (1959)  in  Darfur  and  a  southwesterly 
branch  to  Wau  (1961). 

The  railroads  essentially  had  a  monopoly  on  transportation  for  the 
export  and  import  trade  through  the  1960s,  and  operations  were  profit¬ 
able.  Beginning  in  the  1970s,  however,  losses  occurred  because  of 
declining  operational  efficiency.  A  gradual  erosion  of  freight  traffic  fol¬ 
lowed.  The  1980s  also  saw  a  steady  loss  of  tonnage  as  a  result  of  a  com¬ 
bination  of  inefficient  management,  union  intransigence,  the  failure  of 
agricultural  projects  to  meet  production  goals,  the  dearth  of  spare  parts, 
and  the  continuing  civil  war. 

Despite  the  rapidly  growing  use  of  roads,  the  railroads  remained  of 
paramount  importance  because  of  their  ability  to  move  a  large  volume 
of  agricultural  exports  at  lower  cost  and  to  transport  inland  the  increas¬ 
ing  imports  of  heavy  capital  equipment  and  construction  materials  for 
development,  such  as  requirements  for  oil  exploration  and  drilling  oper¬ 
ations.  Efforts  to  improve  the  rail  system  in  the  late  1970s  and  the  1980s 
included  laying  heavier  rails,  repairing  and  purchasing  new  equipment, 
and  improving  training  and  repair  facilities.  Foreign  governments  and 
international  organizations  provided  substantial  assistance  to  fund  these 


202 


The  Economy 


projects.  Implementation  of  much  of  this  work  was  hampered  by  politi¬ 
cal  instability,  debt,  the  dearth  of  hard  currency,  the  shortage  of  spare 
parts,  and  import  controls. 

By  the  late  1990s,  the  system  was  in  poor  condition  and  required 
substantial  refurbishment  and  investment  in  new  signaling  systems,  and 
addition  of  double  tracks  to  increase  both  capacity  and  speed.  The  roll¬ 
ing  stock  had  deteriorated  as  a  result  of  poor  maintenance,  low  invest¬ 
ment,  and  age;  as  much  as  half  the  rolling  stock  was  out  of  service.  In 
2006  the  network  carried  only  1.3  million  tonnes  of  freight  and  61,000 
passengers,  a  decrease  from  the  previous  year.  Figures  for  2010  were  1 
million  tonnes  and  47,000  passengers. 

The  country  has  two  railroads.  The  main  system,  Sudan  Railways, 
which  is  operated  by  the  government-owned  Sudan  Railways  Corpora¬ 
tion  (SRC),  provides  services  to  most  of  the  country’s  production  and 
consumption  centers.  In  2010  it  consisted  of 4,578  kilometers  of  narrow- 
gauge,  single  track  running  from  Wadi  Haifa,  via  Khartoum,  Sinnar,  and 
Kosti,  to  Al-Obeid.  Tracks  also  ran  from  Khartoum  to  Port  Sudan,  from 
Al-Obeid  to  Nyala  and  to  Wau,  and  from  Sinnar  to  Port  Sudan  via  Al- 
Gedaref  and  Kassala.  However,  there  was  no  service  on  the  tracks  to 
Nyala  and  Wau  in  early  2011  because  of  poor  relations  between  North 
and  South  (the  Nyala  line  had  only  handled  freight,  not  passengers). 
Short  extensions  ran  from  Sinnar  to  Al-Damazin  and  from  Abu  Hamad 
to  Kuraymah.  The  other  railroad,  the  1 ,400-kilometer  Gezira  Light  Rail¬ 
way,  was  owned  by  the  Sudan  Gezira  Board  and  served  the  Gezira 
Scheme  and  its  Manaqil  Extension  (see  fig.  12). 

The  Gezira  Light  Railway,  one  of  the  largest  light  railroads  in 
Africa,  evolved  from  tracks  laid  in  the  1920s  during  construction  of 
the  canals  for  the  Gezira  Scheme.  At  the  time,  the  railroad  had  about 
135  kilometers  of  1.61 -meter-gauge  track.  The  railroad  grew  as  the 
project  area  increased,  and  by  the  mid-1960s  it  consisted  of  a  complex 
system  totaling  more  than  716  kilometers.  Its  primary  purpose  was  to 
serve  the  farm  area  by  carrying  cotton  to  gins  and  fertilizers,  fuel, 
food,  and  other  supplies  to  the  villages  in  the  area.  Operations  usually 
ceased  during  the  rainy  season. 

The  rehabilitation  of  the  country’s  main  lines  and  rolling  stock, 
announced  in  September  1997,  was  essential  to  transport  petroleum.  In 
May  1 999,  the  SRC  announced  plans  to  privatize  both  passenger  and 
cargo  services,  with  the  SRC  retaining  responsibility  for  management 
of  the  rails,  the  stations,  and  signaling  equipment.  The  government 
claimed  that  it  had  received  a  number  of  inquiries  from  foreign  private 
companies  interested  in  managing  and  developing  the  network. 

In  April  2001 ,  the  IDB  granted  Sudan  a  loan  of  US$10.7  million  to  pur¬ 
chase  1 80  railroad  cargo  wagons.  China  announced  that  it  was  prepared  to 


203

finance  the  purchase  of  new  Chinese  locomotives  and  support  repairs  to 
the  network.  In  late  2000,  the  governments  of  Sudan  and  Ethiopia  pro¬ 
posed  to  build  a  US$1.5  billion,  2,200-kilometer  railroad  to  link  Port 
Sudan  with  Addis  Ababa.  There  was  also  talk  of  connecting  with  existing 
lines  south  of  Ethiopia  to  create  a  single  route  across  much  of  Africa.  No 
funding  was  found  for  this  project,  although  there  was  renewed  interest  in 
it  after  the  signing  of  the  CPA  in  January  2005. 

The  government  began  an  ambitious  railroad  rehabilitation  program 
in  2007  with  the  signing  of  a  $1 .2  billion  contract  with  China  to  upgrade 
the  Khartoum  to  Port  Sudan  line  to  a  double  track  and  to  provide  new

The  Economy 


locomotives  and  rolling  stock.  The  government  was  also  planning  to 
improve  the  830-kilometer  northern  sector  of  the  network  to  Wadi 
Haifa.  Limited  service  was  available  on  the  western  and  southern  sec¬ 
tors  of  the  network  to  Nyala  and  Wau  as  of  2010,  but  service  on  both 
lines  was  suspended  by  201 1 . 

Roads 

Sudan  remains  heavily  dependent  on  railroads,  but  the  road  network 
has  played  an  increasingly  important  role  since  1980.  Estimates  of  the 
road  network  in  2009  ranged  upwards  from  55,000  kilometers,  but  it  is 
an  inadequate  network  for  the  size  of  the  country.  Asphalted  all- 
weather  roads,  excluding  paved  streets  in  cities  and  towns,  amounted  to 
roughly  3,600  kilometers,  of  which  the  Khartoum-Port  Sudan  road,  the 
most  important  highway,  accounted  for  almost  1,200  kilometers.  There 
were  about  3,740  kilometers  of  gravel  roads  and  an  estimated  45,000 
kilometers  of  mainly  seasonal  earth  roads  and  sand  tracks,  about  half  of 
which  were  classified  as  feeder  roads. 

The  roads  were  generally  in  poor  condition  in  2009-10  but  usable 
all  year  round,  although  travel  might  be  interrupted  at  times  during  the 
rainy  season.  Most  of  the  gravel  roads  in  South  Sudan  became  unus¬ 
able  after  being  heavily  mined  by  the  insurgent  forces  of  the  Sudan 
People’s  Liberation  Army  (SPLA). 

The  government  favored  the  railroads  until  the  early  1970s,  believ¬ 
ing  that  they  better  met  the  country's  requirements  for  transportation 
and  that  the  primary  purpose  of  roads  was  to  act  as  feeders  to  the  rail 
system.  The  railroads  were  also  a  profitable  government  operation. 
Disillusion  with  railroad  performance  led  to  a  new  emphasis  on  roads 
in  a  readjustment  of  the  Five-Year  Plan  in  1973 — the  so-called  Interim 
Action  Program — and  a  decision  to  encourage  competition  between 
rail  and  road  transport  as  the  best  way  to  improve  services.  Paving  of 
the  dry-weather  road  between  Khartoum  and  Port  Sudan  via  Al- 
Gedaref  and  Kassala  was  the  most  significant  immediate  step. 

Other  important  road-paving  projects  of  the  early  1980s  included  a 
road  from  Wad  Madani  to  Sinnar  and  an  extension  from  Sinnar  to 
Kosti  on  the  White  Nile  completed  in  1984.  Since  then  the  paved  road 
was  extended  to  Umm  Rawabah  and  Al-Obeid.  A  number  of  main 
gravel  roads  radiating  from  Juba  were  also  improved.  These  included 
roads  to  the  towns  southwest  of  Juba  and  a  road  to  the  Ugandan  bor¬ 
der.  In  addition,  the  government  built  a  gravel  all-weather  road  east  of 
Juba  that  reached  the  Kenyan  border  and  connected  with  the  Kenyan 
road  system.  All  of  these  improvements  radiating  from  Juba,  however, 
were  vitiated  by  the  civil  war,  in  which  the  roads  were  extensively 


205 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


mined  by  the  SPLA  and  the  bridges  destroyed.  In  addition,  because 
roads  were  not  maintained,  they  deteriorated  seriously. 

New  asphalt  roads  to  the  north  and  south  of  Khartoum  had  been 
completed  or  were  under  construction  in  the  mid-2000s,  as  well  as 
new  roads  in  the  oil  regions  and  a  road  linking  Sudan  to  Chad.  Grants 
and  concessionary  loans  mainly  from  the  Islamic  Development  Bank, 
the  Arab  Monetary  Fund,  and  other  Arab  development  organizations 
financed  these  projects.  The  highway  from  Al-Gedaref  to  Gondar  in 
Ethiopia  was  refurbished  and  reopened  in  2002  to  allow  expansion  of 
trade  following  improvement  in  diplomatic  ties.  A  newly  paved  high¬ 
way  from  Port  Sudan  to  Atbarah,  funded  by  the  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab 
Economic  Development  at  a  cost  of  US$110  million,  reopened  in 
2009.  It  reduced  travel  time  by  several  hours  between  Port  Sudan  and 
Khartoum.  The  “Northern  Lifeline”  Khartoum-Atbarah-Abu  Hamid- 
Merowe  road  was  also  newly  paved,  open,  and  continued  northward  in 
2011,  and  a  paved  road  went  from  Khartoum  to  Kosti  and  on  south¬ 
ward.  Road  transport  and  bus  services  seemed  likely  to  increase  as 
improved  roads  were  extended  south  of  Khartoum  in  the  country's 
main  agricultural  areas. 

In  anticipation  of  the  signing  of  the  peace  treaty  in  2005,  the  World 
Food  Programme  appealed  for  US$64  million  to  clear  the  land  mines 
and  repair  the  roads  in  the  South  to  facilitate  the  delivery  of  food  to 
millions  of  people  in  the  region  and  to  allow  another  million  people  to 
safely  return  to  their  homes.  Much  work  was  being  done  to  increase 
the  network  of  all-weather  roads  there  because  many  existing  roads 
became  impassable  during  the  rainy  season. 

Other  new  roads  under  construction  included  access  roads  in  the  oil 
regions,  and  a  road  from  Port  Sudan  to  Egypt.  New  bridges  were  built 
over  the  Nile,  all  in  Khartoum  except  for  one  that  opened  in  2007  in 
Merowe.  One  new  road  linking  the  North  and  South  was  planned,  as 
part  of  the  commitment  of  the  CPA,  although  it  had  not  been  built  by 
2011.  Construction  was  underway  in  2009  to  extend  the  small  network 
of  all-weather  roads  in  the  South;  however,  this  work  was  still  hampered 
by  the  presence  of  land  mines. 

Inland  Waterways 

The  Nile  River,  traversing  Sudan  from  south  to  north,  provides  an 
important  inland  transportation  route.  Its  overall  usefulness,  however, 
has  been  limited  by  natural  features,  including  a  number  of  cataracts  in 
the  main  Nile  between  Khartoum  and  the  Egyptian  border.  The  White 
Nile  to  the  south  of  Khartoum  has  shallow  stretches  that  restrict  the 
carrying  capacities  of  barges,  especially  during  the  annual  period  of 
low  water,  and  the  river  has  sharp  bends.  Most  of  these  impediments 


206 


The  Economy 


were  eliminated  by  Chevron,  which  as  part  of  its  oil  exploration  and 
development  program  dredged  the  White  Nile  shoals  and  established 
navigational  beacons  from  Kosti  to  Bentiu.  Manmade  features  such  as 
the  growing  number  of  dams  also  restricts  use  of  the  river,  and  in  the 
South  the  White  Nile  meanders  through  Al-Sudd,  a  vast  swamp  with 
continually  shifting  channels. 

Sudan  has  4,068  kilometers  of  navigable  rivers  overall,  but  only 
1,723  kilometers  are  open  throughout  the  year,  making  river  transport 
minimal.  The  most  important  route  used  to  be  the  1,436-kilometer 
stretch  of  the  White  Nile  from  Kosti  to  Juba  (known  as  the  Southern 
Reach),  which  provided  the  only  generally  usable  transport  connection 
between  the  central  and  southern  parts  of  the  country.  Such  river  traf¬ 
fic  ended  in  1 984  when  the  SPLA  regularly  sank  the  scheduled  steam¬ 
ers,  but  it  began  to  recover  following  the  signing  of  the  CPA  in  2005. 

Transport  services  also  ran  at  one  time  on  tributaries  of  the  White 
Nile  (the  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  the  Jur  River)  to  the  west  of  Malakal. 
These  services  went  as  far  as  Wau  but  were  seasonal,  dependent  on 
water  levels.  They  were  discontinued  during  the  1970s  because  vegeta¬ 
tion  blocked  the  waterways,  particularly  the  fast-growing  water  hya¬ 
cinth.  In  early  2003,  a  tributary  of  the  White  Nile  east  of  Malakal, 
known  as  the  Sobat  River  Corridor,  reopened,  improving  the  distribu¬ 
tion  of  food  aid  in  the  region.  On  the  main  Nile,  a  287-kilometer  stretch 
from  Kuraymah  to  Dongola,  situated  between  the  fourth  and  third  cata¬ 
racts  and  known  as  the  Dongola  Reach,  also  has  regular  service,  except 
during  the  low- water  period  in  February  and  March.  Since  1981  the 
government  has  tried  to  remedy  past  neglect  and  requested  foreign  assis¬ 
tance  to  dredge  the  rivers,  improve  the  quays,  and  provide  navigation 
aids. 

The  River  Transport  Corporation  (RTC)  operated  as  a  parastatal  from 
1973  until  2007  when  two  private  companies,  the  Nile  River  Transport 
Corporation  and  the  Sudan  River  Transport  Corporation,  took  it  over. 
Before  that,  the  latter  companies  were  run  by  the  Sudan  Railways  Cor¬ 
poration  essentially  as  feeders  to  the  rail  line.  Another  parastatal,  the 
joint  Sudanese-Egyptian  River  Navigation  Corporation,  operated  ser¬ 
vices  between  Wadi  Haifa  and  Aswan,  but  service  often  was  disrupted 
by  political  tension  between  Egypt  and  Sudan.  Since  the  privatization  of 
the  RTC,  other  private  operators  started  providing  services.  There  were 
six  private  companies  operating  river  vessels  in  2009. 

The  government  began  in  2003  to  expand  the  Sea  Ports  Corporation 
in  order  for  it  to  manage  river  services  and  river-navigation  studies  to 
qualify  three  new  ports  at  Malakal,  Juba,  and  Al-Renk.  In  2006  a 
Kuwaiti  group  signed  a  preliminary  agreement  to  redevelop  the  port  of 
Juba  on  the  White  Nile.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


River  cargo  and  passenger  traffic  varies  from  year  to  year,  depend¬ 
ing  in  large  part  on  the  availability  and  capacity  of  transport  vessels. 
During  the  1970s,  roughly  100,000  tonnes  of  cargo  and  250,000  pas¬ 
sengers  were  carried  annually.  However,  the  closing  of  the  Southern 
Reach  in  1984  made  river  traffic  insignificant.  Cargo  had  declined  to 
fewer  than  44,000  tonnes  and  passengers  to  fewer  than  5,000  per  year 
by  the  early  2000s,  but  by  2010,  inland  waterways  transported  1 14,000 
tonnes  and  13,000  passengers  despite  rapids,  cataracts,  a  growing 
number  of  dams,  and  seasonal  variations  in  water  levels  that  continued 
to  hinder  river  traffic. 

Civil  Aviation 

Sudan  Airways  provides  scheduled  domestic  air  service.  The  com¬ 
pany  began  its  operations  in  1 947  as  a  government  department,  and  it 
has  operated  commercially  since  the  late  1960s.  In  2010  Sudan  Air¬ 
ways  provided  international  services  from  Khartoum,  Port  Sudan,  and 
Juba  to  countries  in  the  Middle  East,  mainly  Egypt,  Saudi  Arabia,  and 
the  UAE,  and  to  several  countries  in  Africa.  However,  the  European 
Union  banned  Sudan-based  airlines  from  flying  into  member  states,  on 
the  basis  of  safety  assessments  by  the  International  Civil  Aviation 
Organization. 

Sudan  Airways  had  scheduled  flights  from  Khartoum  to  15  other 
domestic  airports  in  2010,  of  which  Khartoum,  Port  Sudan,  Al-Obeid, 
Al-Fashir,  and  Juba  were  the  most  important,  and  the  only  ones  where 
night  flights  could  operate.  There  were  also  airstrips  at  many  other  loca¬ 
tions,  especially  in  the  South  where  they  could  be  the  only  means  of 
access  during  the  rainy  season,  and  there  were  airstrips  at  the  oil  fields 
north  of  Bentiu.  Sudan  Airways  had  a  monopoly  on  domestic  passenger 
flights  in  the  North,  although  there  were  a  number  of  private  air-freight 
companies  and  airlines  flying  between  the  North  and  the  South. 

In  May  2005,  the  government  announced  that  a  new  $530  million 
international  airport  would  be  built  some  45  kilometers  southwest  of 
Omdurman.  The  following  month,  Sudan's  Civil  Aviation  Authority 
allocated  $452  million  to  develop  and  upgrade  1 7  airports  in  the  capi¬ 
tal  cities  of  the  Sudanese  states.  Construction  of  the  new  international 
airport  was  underway  in  2010  with  completion  expected  in  2012. 

Sudan  Airways  and  Ethiopian  Airlines  signed  an  agreement  in  mid- 
2006  to  cooperate  broadly  on  fleets,  joint  operation  of  flights,  mainte¬ 
nance,  and  ground  handling.  They  would  also  cooperate  on  flights 
linking  Khartoum  with  Bombay  and  Beijing. 

The  Sudan  Airways  fleet  in  2010  consisted  of  four  Airbus  planes 
(three  A300s  and  one  A3 10),  four  Fokker  50s,  and  one  Boeing  707 
cargo  plane.  This  fleet  carried  more  than  479,000  passengers  and  8,200 


208 


The  Economy 


tonnes  of  air  freight  that  year,  slightly  less  than  in  2004,  when  passen¬ 
gers  were  estimated  at  nearly  562,800  and  air  freight  amounted  to 
approximately  9,400  tonnes.  In  2004  five  companies  provided  charter 
freight  services  to  Africa,  the  Middle  East,  and  Europe. 

Sudan  Airways  operations  generally  showed  losses  in  the  past,  and 
in  the  early  1980s  the  corporation  reportedly  was  receiving  a  sizable 
annual  government  subsidy.  In  1983  the  government  proposed  to  priva¬ 
tize  the  airline,  but  plans  were  put  on  hold  following  the  coup  in  April 
1985.  Like  the  railroads  and  steamers,  Sudan  Airways  suffered  from  a 
shortage  of  skilled  personnel,  overstaffing,  and  lack  of  hard  currency 
and  credit  for  spare  parts  and  proper  maintenance.  Plans  for  privatiza¬ 
tion  revived  in  1991  and  again  in  1999,  when  Sudan  contracted  two 
Western  companies  to  advise  on  the  sale.  In  March  2002,  the  govern¬ 
ment  announced  its  intention  to  sell  up  to  51  percent  of  the  airline’s 
shares  to  local  investors  on  the  Khartoum  Stock  Exchange  and  to 
locate  a  foreign  investor  to  manage  the  airline.  By  mid-2004  the  minis¬ 
ter  of  finance  and  national  economy  announced  that  the  government 
would  hold  30  percent  of  the  shares  in  the  new  firm,  while  21  percent 
would  be  offered  to  Sudanese  businessmen  and  49  percent  to  foreign 
investors.  The  privatization  was  completed  in  2007. 

Marine  Ports  and  Shipping 

Port  Sudan,  situated  on  an  inlet  of  the  Red  Sea,  is  the  country’s  major 
commercial  port,  although  about  20  percent  of  its  traffic  passes  through 
Sawakin,  65  kilometers  to  the  south.  Petroleum  is  exported  from 
Bashayir  Marine  Terminal  near  Port  Sudan.  Construction  began  in  1905 
on  Port  Sudan,  planned  as  the  entry  and  exit  point  for  the  foreign  trade 
that  the  railroad  line  was  to  carry  between  Khartoum  and  the  Red  Sea.  It 
operated  as  a  department  of  the  SRC  until  1974,  when  it  became  part  of 
the  Sea  Ports  Corporation,  a  public  enterprise  set  up  to  manage  Sudan’s 
marine  ports.  Facilities  at  the  port  eventually  included  15  cargo  berths, 
sheds,  warehouses,  and  storage  tanks  for  edible  oils,  molasses,  and 
petroleum  products. 

Port  traffic  had  reached  capacity  level  by  the  mid-1970s.  Physical 
expansion  of  the  harbor  and  adjacent  areas  was  generally  precluded  by 
natural  features  and  the  proximity  of  the  city  of  Port  Sudan.  However, 
surveys  showed  that  modernization  and  improvement  of  existing  facili¬ 
ties  and  the  addition  of  further  cargo-handling  equipment  could  consid¬ 
erably  increase  usage.  In  1978,  with  the  assistance  of  a  loan  from  the 
IDA,  work  began  on  adding  deep-water  berths  and  providing  roll-on 
roll-off  container  facilities.  A  West  German  group  provided  a  loan  to 
purchase  equipment.  In  1983  a  US$25  million  World  Bank  credit  aided 


209 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


another  phase.  Two  of  the  major  improvements  made  the  port  more 
readily  usable  by  road  vehicles  and  increased  storage  facilities. 

Construction  of  another  deep-water  port  at  Sawakin  had  long  been 
under  consideration  in  response  to  the  projected  growth  of  port  traffic 
in  the  latter  part  of  the  twentieth  century.  The  port  opened  in  1991  and 
could  handle  some  1.5  million  tonnes  of  cargo  per  year.  The  port  at 
Bashayir  was  a  storage  facility  and  a  tanker  terminal,  built  to  act  as  the 
country’s  oil  export  point.  It  had  five  storage  tanks  and  a  capacity  of 
around  2  million  barrels  following  an  expansion  completed  in  2007. 

A  national  merchant  marine,  Sudan  Shipping  Line,  was  established 
in  1962  as  a  joint  venture  between  the  government  and  Yugoslavia.  In 
1967  it  became  wholly  government  owned.  From  the  initial  two  Yugo¬ 
slav-built  cargo  vessels,  the  fleet  expanded  to  a  total  of  16  ships  by 
2003  and  to  19  thereafter.  Sailings,  which  had  been  mainly  between 
Red  Sea  ports  and  northern  Europe,  included  several  Mediterranean 
ports.  In  20 1 0  the  merchant  marine  transported  2 1 ,000  tonnes  of  goods, 
a  decline  (although  only  temporary)  from  the  33,000  tonnes  carried  in 
2009. 

Pipelines 

Operational  problems  on  the  Port  Sudan-Khartoum  section  of  Sudan 
Railways  had  resulted  by  the  early  1970s  in  inadequate  supplies  of 
petroleum  products  reaching  Khartoum  and  other  parts  of  the  country.  In 
1977  an  850-kilometer  oil  pipeline  from  the  port  to  Khartoum,  parallel 
to  the  railroad  line,  relieved  traffic  pressure  on  the  railroad.  It  reached  its 
capacity  of  600,000  tonnes  a  year  by  mid- 1981,  but  the  next  year  saw 
capacity  boosted  to  1  million  tonnes.  The  pipeline  carried  only  refined 
products,  including  gasoline,  gas  oil,  kerosene,  and  aviation  fuel,  either 
from  the  refinery  at  the  port  or  from  import-holding  facilities  there. 
These  products  were  moved  to  storage  tanks  at  Khartoum,  with  some 
capacity  offloaded  at  Atbarah.  Rail  tank  cars  released  by  the  pipeline 
then  carried  increased  supplies  of  petroleum  products  in  the  western  and 
southwestern  regions  of  the  country. 

In  August  1 999,  GNPOC  completed  an  oil-export  pipeline  connecting 
the  South’s  Unity  and  Heglig  oil  fields  near  Bentiu  to  the  export  terminal 
at  Bashayir  near  Port  Sudan,  via  Khartoum  and  the  Al-Jayli  refinery  (see 
fig.  1 1).  Oil  exports  began  the  next  month.  The  1,610-kilometer  pipeline, 
the  longest  in  Africa,  had  a  design  capacity  of  450,000  b/d.  First-phase 
capacity  was  250,000  b/d,  sufficient  until  new  production  fields  came  on 
stream  in  2002.  At  that  time,  GNPOC  increased  the  capacity  of  the  pipe¬ 
line  to  300,000  b/d,  completing  work  by  the  end  of  2003,  and  taking 
capacity  up  to  400,000  b/d  in  2004.

Sudan  opened  the  1,500-kilometer  Petrodar  pipeline  in  April  2006  to 
take  crude  from  the  Melut  basin  in  the  South  to  Port  Sudan  on  the  Red 
Sea;  it  had  been  scheduled  to  go  online  in  August  2005  but  was  delayed 
by  faulty  foundation  work.  The  new  pipeline  had  an  initial  capacity  of 
180,000  b/d  and  its  design  allows  for  a  future  boost  to  500,000  b/d. 
Short  extensions  connect  outlying  oil  fields  with  the  Petrodar  and  Bentiu 
lines.  Petrodar  is  a  partnership,  mainly  consisting  of  China's  state-owned 
CNPC  and  Malaysian  PETRONAS,  and  several  smaller  companies. 

Pipeline  potential  in  Sudan  would  exceed  1  million  b/d  if  all  exist¬ 
ing  pipelines  were  to  be  upgraded.  Expansion  was  restricted  by  limited 
refinery  capacity,  among  other  restraints  in  20 1 1 . 

Telecommunications 

Telecommunications  in  Sudan  improved  rapidly  in  the  twenty-first 
century,  although  the  country  was  only  beginning  to  emerge  from 
decades  of  government  monopoly.  In  1990  the  entire  nation  had  fewer 
than  75,000  telephones  (a  teledensity  ratio  of  nearly  0.3  per  100  peo¬ 
ple),  two-thirds  of  which  were  in  the  Khartoum  area.  In  2002  the  Sudan 
Telecommunications  Company  (SudaTel),  a  monopoly  formed  from 
the  old  Ministry  of  Post  and  Telecommunications  in  1 994,  initiated  an 
expansion.  Initially  a  parastatal,  SudaTel  eventually  listed  its  shares  on 
the  Khartoum  Stock  Exchange  and  later  traded  them  abroad,  especially 
in  the  Gulf.  UAE  and  Qatari  telecommunications  companies  bought  a 
substantial  share,  increasing  capital  to  around  US$300  million  by  the 
beginning  of  2002.  That  capital  subsequently  supported  development, 
including  installation  of  a  fiber-optic  network,  expansion  of  the  system 
to  more  remote  rural  areas,  and  an  increase  in  the  number  of  telephones 
to  356,100  by  2008. 

In  2004  the  KanarTel  consortium  won  the  second  license  to  provide 
landline-telephone  service  in  Sudan  after  promising  to  invest  US$200 
million  in  the  project  in  the  first  two  years  of  operations.  The  main  share¬ 
holder  (40  percent)  of  the  consortium  was  Emirates  Telecommunications 
Corporation  (Etisalat)  from  the  United  Arab  Emirates.  Other  members 
included  the  Saudi  Arabian  group,  Alrawabi,  owned  by  Abdeleziz  Ben

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Turk,  Swedish  company  Swedtel  AB,  and  three  Sudanese  partners. 
South  African  payphone  manufacturer  Psitek  also  entered  the  market  two 
years  after  its  establishment  in  East  Africa.  In  2006  the  firm  received  the 
necessary  regulatory  approvals  for  Sudan.  However,  there  were  still 
fewer  than  5  landlines  per  1,000  people  in  2008. 

SudaTel  cofounded  (with  a  40-percent  share)  MobiTel,  Sudan’s 
Global  System  for  Mobile  (GSM)  network  in  Khartoum  State  in  Feb¬ 
ruary  1997.  By  the  end  of  2003,  there  were  more  than  650,000  Mobi¬ 
Tel  mobile  cellular  telephone  subscribers  in  17  cities,  a  user  rate  of 
about  two  per  100  people,  well  below  the  average  of  6.2  for  Africa. 
However,  SudaTel's  expansion  plan  increased  the  number  of  subscrib¬ 
ers  to  1.83  million  by  2005.  Zain,  a  Kuwait-based  company,  bought 
MobiTel  in  2006  and  increased  its  subscription  base  to  5  million  by 
2008.  Its  main  competitors  were  Sudani,  a  subsidiary  of  SudaTel  with 
4  million  subscribers,  and  Areeba  (owned  by  a  South  African  firm, 
MTN).  In  2008  the  total  number  of  mobile  phone  subscriptions  was 
1 1 .2  million,  with  a  penetration  rate  of  about  35  percent.  Large  areas  of 
Sudan  are  not  covered  by  mobile-phone  networks,  so  satellite  phones 
are  also  used. 

SudaTel  was  also  the  majority  owner  of  Sudan’s  first  Internet  ser¬ 
vice  provider,  SudaNet,  which  began  operation  in  1998.  Usage  grew 
from  5,000  Internet  users  in  1999,  to  30,000  in  2000  and  4.2  million  in 
2008.  Several  providers  offered  service  by  201 1,  there  being  no  barri¬ 
ers  to  foreign  ownership.  Although  the  number  of  users  grew  rapidly, 
the  user  rate  is  still  well  below  that  of  neighboring  Uganda  and  Kenya. 
Growth  has  been  held  back  by  the  low  number  of  personal  computers 
in  the  country  (just  300,000  in  2003),  and  by  concerns  about  the  quality 
of  service  provided.  Users  complain  about  slow  and  unstable  connec¬ 
tions  and  high  cost  relative  to  average  incomes.  Although  personal 
computers  are  not  yet  in  widespread  use,  cyber  cafes  are  common, 
especially  in  Khartoum. 

A  domestic  satellite  system  with  14  ground  stations,  supplemented 
by  coaxial  cable  and  a  microwave  network,  linked  telephone  exchanges 
and  broadcast  facilities  within  the  country  in  2008-9.  Eleven  cities  had 
amplitude  modulation  (AM)  radio  stations.  Khartoum,  Atbarah,  and 
Wad  Madani  had  television  stations  with  broadcasts  in  Arabic  seven 
hours  nightly;  Juba  had  a  local  station,  TV  Channel  1 .  The  country  had 
an  estimated  7,550,000  radio  receivers  in  1997  and  8,500,000  televi¬ 
sion  sets  in  2000.  In  August  2005,  the  general  manager  of  the  Sudan 
Radio  and  Television  Corporation  announced  that  46  frequency  modu¬ 
lation  (FM)  and  four  short-wave  (SW)  radio  stations  would  be  set  up  to 
provide  coverage  in  all  Sudanese  states.  He  also  announced  that  26  new 
television  stations  would  be  set  up.

The  Economy 


The  government  controls  TV  and  radio  in  the  North,  requiring  that 
the  media  reflect  government  policies,  and  there  is  a  permanent  military 
censor  of  TV  programming.  The  Sudan  National  Broadcasting  Corpo¬ 
ration  provides  government-run  television  services  on  two  channels, 
and  also  via  satellite.  The  Sudan  National  Radio  Corporation  broadcasts 
the  government-run,  national  and  regional  networks  in  Arabic,  English, 
and  other  languages.  Mango  96  FM  is  a  private,  music-based  station  in 
Khartoum. 

The  Southern  government  controls  telecommunications  in  the  South, 
providing  TV  services  from  Juba,  as  well  as  Radio  Juba  programs.  There 
are  also  several  private  FM  stations  in  the  South,  and  some  foreign  radio 
broadcasts.  Miraya  (Mirror)  is  operated  by  the  UN  mission  from  Juba, 
and  Liberty  FM  broadcast  from  Juba  and  Yei.  Radio  Dabanga,  founded 
in  2008  in  the  Netherlands,  broadcasts  three  hours  a  day  to  the  people  of 
Darfur. 

International  Trade  and  Balance  of  Payments 

International  Trade 

Sudan’s  exports  in  2008  amounted  to  US$12.4  billion,  and  its 
imports  totaled  US$8.9  billion.  Agricultural  products  dominated  Suda¬ 
nese  exports  until  Sudan  began  to  export  petroleum  and  petroleum 
products.  By  2000  the  value  of  petroleum-based  products  surpassed  the 
total  of  all  other  exports  combined.  By  2008,  they  had  reached  US$1 1 .6 
billion  and  have  accounted  for  80  to  94  percent  of  all  export  revenue 
since  2000,  the  result  of  expanded  oil  production,  as  well  as  higher  oil 
prices.  Because  oil  provides  such  a  large  proportion  of  export  earnings, 
Sudan  is  now  vulnerable  to  the  volatility  of  the  international  price  of 
oil. 

Sudan  had  long  been  the  world's  second  largest  exporter  of  long- 
staple  cotton.  Cotton  exports  provided  more  than  50  percent  of  total 
export  revenues  in  the  1960s  but  declined  to  only  1 . 1  percent  of  export 
revenues  in  2008.  Gum  arabic  was  in  second  place  until  the  1960s,  but 
its  importance  was  even  less  than  that  of  cotton  in  2008.  Livestock 
was  the  most  important  non-oil  product  in  2002,  displacing  cash 
crops.  The  government  encouraged  the  increase  in  livestock  produc¬ 
tion,  especially  camels,  goats,  sheep,  and  cattle,  but  the  export  of  live¬ 
stock  declined  dramatically  thereafter,  with  proceeds  providing  only 
0.3  percent  of  export  revenues  in  2008.  Sesame  increased  in  impor¬ 
tance  in  the  1990s  and  displaced  cotton  as  the  most  important  export 
commodity  in  1996,  until  petroleum  exports  became  dominant.  Ses¬ 
ame  remained  the  most  important  agricultural  export  product,  provid- 


213

ing  2.3  percent  of  export  revenues  in  2008.  Other  important  exports  in 
2008  were  gold,  sugar,  and  peanuts. 

The  share  of  machinery  and  transport  equipment  was  32.8  percent 
of  the  value  of  total  imports  in  2008.  Large  quantities  of  capital  goods 
were  imported,  mainly  for  the  development  and  expansion  of  the  oil 
industry  and  the  expansion  of  related  infrastructure.  Government  plans 
for  self-sufficiency  through  the  development  of  import-substitution 
industries  achieved  only  limited  success,  as  manufactured  goods  still 
equaled  24.7  percent  of  the  value  of  imports.  Economic  growth  and 
the  need  for  a  peace  dividend  following  the  signing  of  the  January 
2005  CPA,  led  to  increased  import  spending  in  2004-6,  meaning  that 
there  was  a  trade  deficit  during  those  years.  The  trade  balance  returned 
to  a  surplus  in  2007. 

In  the  early  Condominium  era,  Egypt  was  Sudan’s  main  customer. 
The  development  of  the  Gezira  Scheme,  however,  resulted  in  large-scale 
exports  of  cotton  to  Britain,  which  by  the  end  of  the  1920s  was  purchas¬ 
ing  about  80  percent  of  Sudanese  exports.  At  the  time  of  Sudanese  inde¬ 
pendence,  Britain  continued  to  be  the  largest  customer.  During  the 
1960s,  India,  West  Germany,  and  Italy  emerged  as  major  buyers;  late  in 
the  decade,  Japan  also  became  a  major  customer. 

After  the  May  1 969  coup,  Khartoum  took  steps  to  expand  trade  with 
the  Soviet  Union  and  Eastern  Europe.  Exports  to  the  Soviet  Union  rose 
dramatically  in  1970  and  1971  as  that  country  became  Sudan's  leading 
customer.  After  the  abortive  communist-led  coup  of  1971,  however, 
relations  deteriorated,  and  Soviet  purchases  dropped  almost  to  nil. 

Saudi  Arabia  became  Sudan’s  main  export  market  in  the  late  1980s, 
buying  sorghum  and  livestock.  Britain  also  remained  an  important  export 
destination.  Other  major  customers  were  France  and  China.  The  United 
States,  although  not  one  of  Sudan’s  largest  purchasers,  became  a  major 
customer  in  the  later  1980s,  mainly  buying  cotton,  gum  arabic,  and  pea¬ 
nuts.  Saudi  Arabia  continued  to  be  the  leading  export  market  throughout 
the  second  half  of  the  1990s,  purchasing  20  percent  of  Sudan’s  exports, 
especially  livestock.  However,  the  development  of  the  oil  industry  changed 
the  direction  of  trade,  with  China  and  Japan  purchasing  63  percent  of 
Sudan’s  exports  in  2001.  The  trend  continued  as  the  oil  industry  developed 
further,  with  East  Asia  replacing  the  Middle  East  as  the  main  export  mar¬ 
ket.  In  2007  China  absorbed  67.9  percent  of  Sudan’s  exports,  followed  by 
Japan  (19.0  percent),  South  Korea  (2.0)  and  Saudi  Arabia  (1.7  percent). 

Sudan's  imports  come  from  a  wide  range  of  countries,  led  by  Saudi 
Arabia  in  the  late  1980s.  In  1989  Saudi  Arabia  supplied  nearly  14.1 
percent  of  Sudan’s  total  imports,  with  petroleum  the  chief  import  item. 
Britain  was  Sudan’s  main  import  source  until  1980;  in  the  late  1980s, 
it  became  Khartoum’s  second  largest  provider,  supplying  an  estimated 


214 


The  Economy 


8.3  percent  of  the  country’s  imports  in  1989.  Britain  had  well-estab¬ 
lished  commercial  and  banking  operations  in  Khartoum  and  a  leading 
position  in  exporting  manufactured  goods,  vehicles,  tobacco,  bever¬ 
ages,  chemicals,  and  machinery  to  Sudan. 

Iraq  was  a  prime  source  of  Sudan’s  imports  through  1978,  because  it 
was  the  principal  supplier  of  crude  petroleum,  a  function  that  was  taken 
over  by  Saudi  Arabia  in  1979  after  Iraq  cut  off  oil  supplies  because 
Sudan  backed  Egypt  in  the  latter’s  peace  initiative  with  Israel.  In  the 
last  years  of  the  al-Numayri  government  (1969-85),  bilateral  trade 
with  Egypt  declined  sharply,  but  in  April  1988,  and  again  in  June  1991, 
Sudan  and  Egypt  signed  large  trade  agreements. 

Improved  relations  with  Libya  enabled  Tripoli  to  become  Sudan’s 
third  largest  import  supplier  in  1989.  In  January  of  that  year,  Sudan  and 
Tripoli  signed  an  agreement  for  Sudan  to  buy  Libyan  crude  oil,  and  in 
December  Sudan  agreed  to  purchase  Libyan  fuel,  chemicals,  fertilizer, 
cement,  and  caustic  soda. 

China  was  the  prime  import  supplier  in  2007,  having  superseded  Saudi 
Arabia  in  2004.  In  2007  China  provided  27.9  percent  of  Sudan’s  imports, 
followed  by  Saudi  Arabia  (7.5  percent),  India  (6.3  percent)  and  Egypt 
(5.6  percent).  Libya,  which  previously  had  supplied  most  of  Sudan’s 
imports,  especially  petroleum  products,  saw  its  exports  decline  dramati¬ 
cally  from  15  percent  of  Sudan’s  total  imports  in  1999,  as  demand  for 
imported  refined  products  ended. 

Balance  of  Payments 

An  accurate  presentation  of  Sudan’s  balance  of  payments — the  sum¬ 
mary  in  money  terms  of  transactions  with  the  rest  of  the  world — was 
hampered  in  the  past  by  what  foreign  economists  considered  understate¬ 
ments  in  official  statistics  of  imports  and  public-sector  loans.  The  bal¬ 
ance  of  trade  from  1960  through  1999  usually  showed  a  deficit,  except 
for  1973,  in  the  current  account  (covering  trade,  services,  and  transfer 
transactions).  From  1973  until  2000  (when  Sudan  became  self-sufficient 
in  petroleum  and  petroleum  products),  the  balance  of  trade  was  unfavor¬ 
ably  affected  by  higher  petroleum-import  costs  as  well  as  by  the  higher 
costs  of  other  imports  that  resulted  from  worldwide  inflation  caused  by 
oil  price  increases.  The  impact  on  the  balance  of  payments  was  espe¬ 
cially  serious  because  of  its  coincidence  with  the  implementation  after 
1973  of  an  intensive  development  program  that  required  greatly 
increased  imports. 

Beginning  in  1999,  export  receipts  increased  dramatically  as  Sudan 
began  to  export  oil.  In  2000  export  earnings  increased  to  US$1.9  billion, 
with  oil  earnings  accounting  for  78  percent  of  the  total.  Revenues  con¬ 
tinued  to  increase  to  US$4.8  billion  in  2005  as  oil  prices  remained  high.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  development  of  the  oil  industry  not  only  increased  export  earnings, 
but  also  saved  foreign  exchange  as  Sudan  became  self-sufficient  in 
refined  petroleum  products.  The  sum  of  those  changes  produced  trade 
surpluses  in  2000  and  2001— the  first  surpluses  in  recent  history.  The 
years  2005  and  2006  fell  into  deficit  as  surging  imports  and  delays  in 
bringing  new  oil  concessions  on  stream  had  a  negative  effect  on  the 
trade  balance.  Although  2007  and  2008  produced  trade  surpluses  once 
again,  preliminary  information  for  2009  revealed  a  deficit  produced  by  a 
decline  in  the  value  of  oil  exports  (see  table  3  Appendix). 

The  services  sector  (insurance,  travel,  and  other)  and  investment 
income  regularly  experiences  a  net  loss,  which  has  increased  since  oil 
exports  began.  Service  debits  reached  US$2.9  billion  in  2007  and  2008, 
as  a  result  of  costs  associated  with  the  increasing  volume  of  Sudanese 
imports,  as  well  as  the  increasing  costs  of  transporting  the  govern¬ 
ment’s  share  of  oil  to  market. 

Investment-income  debits  increased  as  a  result  of  the  repatriation  of 
profits  of  the  foreign  firms  that  have  developed  the  oil  sector.  In  2008 
income  debits  reached  US$5.7  billion. 

Transfers  usually  had  a  positive  balance,  but  they  were  insufficient 
to  offset  the  usual  deficit  in  trade  and  services.  They  were  composed 
mainly  of  remittances  from  Sudan’s  overseas  workforce,  exceeding 
US$20  million  in  2007,  according  to  official  data.  The  growth  of  remit¬ 
tances  reflected  the  strong  economic  growth  in  the  Gulf  where  many 
Sudanese  worked,  and  also  the  increased  confidence  in  the  Sudanese 
banking  system,  which  encouraged  expatriate  Sudanese  to  transfer  and 
convert  remittances  through  official  channels  rather  than  by  informal 
methods.  Thus,  part  of  the  increase  might  also  have  reflected  the  cap¬ 
turing  of  flows  that  were  previously  unrecorded.  Current  transfers  went 
temporarily  into  deficit  in  2008,  but  preliminary  data  from  2009  indi¬ 
cate  that  they  recovered. 

The  increase  in  the  non-merchandise  account  raised  net  outflows  to 
US$5.2  billion  in  2008,  continuing  deficits  in  the  current  account.  As 
the  economy  grew,  however,  the  value  of  the  deficits  as  a  percentage 
of  GDP  declined  on  average,  compared  to  the  five  years  before  oil 
exports  began. 

Net  inflows  and  disbursement  of  foreign  loans  and  other  capital 
generally  failed  to  cover  the  negative  balance  in  the  current  account, 
and  the  overall  balance  of  payments  was  regularly  in  deficit.  The 
shortfall  in  201 1  was  estimated  at  US$406  million. 

Prospects  for  the  Future 

Sudan  remains  a  poor  country  as  a  result  of  previous  inadequate 
economic  management;  years  of  drought,  which  have  had  a  negative 


216 


The  Economy 


impact  on  the  agricultural  economy;  and  the  disruption  caused  by  civil 
war — all  of  which  have  blocked  economic  development  over  the 
years.  One  of  the  important  steps  that  will  be  necessary  in  the  future  is 
to  improve  the  long-term,  overall  management  of  the  economy. 

The  economy  continues  to  be  based  on  agriculture,  although  the 
development  of  the  oil-export  industry  has  changed  its  structure.  As  oil 
became  the  most  important  export  commodity,  eliminating  previous 
trade  deficits  and  promising  even  greater  revenues  in  the  future,  it  has 
the  potential  to  continue  to  stimulate  economic  growth.  Development 
of  the  oil  sector  has  increased  foreign  investment,  which,  in  turn,  has 
stimulated  development  in  the  industrial  sector,  with  potential  for  fur¬ 
ther  development  and  diversification  henceforth. 

Within  the  agricultural  sector,  livestock  has  become  the  fastest 
growing  segment.  As  exports  became  established  in  the  markets  in  the 
Gulf,  especially  in  Saudi  Arabia,  they  also  attracted  foreign  invest¬ 
ment.  Strong  demand  for  livestock  in  the  international  market  and  gov¬ 
ernment  encouragement  of  commercial  livestock  production  (with 
close  attention  to  disease  prevention)  are  likely  to  allow  increased 
diversification  from  traditional  crops  within  the  agricultural  sector. 

Future  development,  however,  must  address  the  inadequate  trans¬ 
port  network.  In  particular,  improving  the  road  system  is  critical,  espe¬ 
cially  increasing  the  infrastructure  of  paved,  all-weather  roads,  to  allow 
the  distribution  of  food  crops  and  other  goods  throughout  the  formerly 
united  country  and  to  neighboring  nations.  It  will  be  especially  impor¬ 
tant  to  reconstruct  the  roads  that  were  destroyed  in  South  Sudan  during 
the  civil  war.  The  railroad  infrastructure  also  needs  upgrading,  as  it  is  in 
poor  condition  as  a  result  of  both  its  age  and  lack  of  maintenance  and 
investment.  The  proposed  rail  link  with  Ethiopia  would  also  increase 
communication  between  the  two  countries  and  would  be  especially 
beneficial  to  trade  with  South  Sudan,  were  it  ever  to  be  built. 

The  most  important  key  to  economic  development  is  a  lasting  peace 
supported  by  good  governance.  Whereas  a  peace  treaty  was  signed  in 
2005  between  the  SPLM/A  and  the  government  of  Sudan,  it  is  impor¬ 
tant  to  find  a  way  to  end  the  conflict  in  the  Darfur  region  as  well.  With 
peace,  bilateral  donors  and  international  organizations  would  be  more 
willing  to  assist  North  and  South  with  development  efforts,  private 
investors  more  willing  to  risk  their  capital,  and  the  governments  of  both 
countries  would  be  able  to  use  domestic  resources,  previously  drained 
by  war,  for  purposes  of  economic  development. 

The  referendum  in  early  2011  determined  that  Sudan  would  become 
two  separate  countries.  As  separation  proceeds,  it  is  necessary  to  agree 
on  the  division  of  Sudan’s  resources,  especially  since  most  of  the 
known  oil  reserves  are  in  the  South,  the  region  most  in  need  of  eco¬ 
nomic  development.  Above  all,  it  is  also  important  to  maintain  peace

The  economic  and  political  upheavals  that  have  characterized  Sudan 
for  many  years  have  made  statistical  data  difficult  to  obtain,  unreliable, 
and  often  out  of  date.  War  with  the  SPLM/A  has  made  it  particularly 
difficult  to  obtain  data  for  areas  in  Southern  Sudan  because  of  lack  of 
access  to  those  areas  that  have  not  been  under  central  government  con¬ 
trol.  Nevertheless,  there  are  important  texts  that  can  be  consulted  for 
the  background  information  to  obtain  an  understanding  of  Sudan's 
economy. 

Peter  Woodward’s  Sudan,  1898-1989:  The  Unstable  State  describes 
the  political,  and,  to  some  extent,  the  economic  evolution  of  Sudan 
from  the  establishment  of  the  Condominium  until  1989.  Tim  Niblock’s 
“Pariah  States”  and  Sanctions  in  the  Middle  East:  Iraq,  Libya,  Sudan 
addresses  the  political,  psychological,  and  economic  impact  of  sanc¬ 
tions  designed  in  response  to  Sudan’s  transgressions  during  its  civil 
wars.  Douglas  H.  Johnson  examines  the  historical,  political,  economic, 
and  social  factors  involved  in  Sudan’s  civil  wars  in  The  Root  Causes  of 
Sudan’s  Civil  Wars.  The  newest  text  is  Ruth  Iyob  and  Gilbert  M. 
Khadiagala’s  Sudan:  The  Elusive  Quest  for  Peace,  which  examines  the 
factors  that  have  contributed  to  the  civil  wars  and  concludes  with  rec¬ 
ommendations  for  political  and  economic  reforms  that  will  be  required 
for  lasting  peace. 

Some  older  materials  continue  to  be  valuable.  These  include  Medani 
M.  Ahmed’s  The  Political  Economy  of  Development  in  the  Sudan ,  Mud- 
dathir  Abdel-Rahim’s  Sudan  since  Independence:  Studies  of  the  Political 
Development  since  1956 ,  as  well  as  P.  P.  van  de  Well  and  Abdel  Ghaffar 
Muhammad  Ahmed’s  Perspectives  on  Development  in  the  Sudan: 
Selected  Papers  for  a  Research  Workshop  in  The  Hague ,  and  the  discus¬ 
sion  papers  of  the  University  of  Bremen’s  Sudan  Economy  Research 
Group. 

Statistical  information  can  be  found  in  the  Bank  of  Sudan’s  annual 
reports  as  well  as  Sudan’s  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics.  However,  it  is 
difficult  to  obtain  access  to  official  publications  unless  they  have  been 
posted  on  each  agency’s  Web  site.  Valuable  international  sources  of 
data  include  the  most  recent  Africa  South  of  the  Sahara  yearbooks,  and 
both  the  annual  Country  Profde  and  the  quarterly  Country  Reports  on 
Sudan  published  by  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit,  although  publica¬ 
tion  of  the  Country  Profde  was  discontinued  after  the  2009  issue. 
Other  valuable  sources  include  the  publications  of  the  International 
Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  African  Development  Bank,

as  well  as  those  of  UN  organizations  such  as  the  Food  and  Agriculture 
Organization  and  the  International  Labour  Organisation. 

An  excellent  introduction  to  reach  an  understanding  of  Islamic  banking 
in  Sudan  is  to  be  found  in  Endre  Stiansen’s  “Interest  Politics:  Islamic 
Finance  in  the  Sudan,  1977-2001.”  More  general  works  on  Islamic  bank¬ 
ing  include  Fuad  Al-Omar  and  Mohammed  Abdel-Haq’s  Islamic  Bank¬ 
ing:  Theory,  Practice,  and  Challenges  and  Mervyn  K.  Lewis  and  Latifa 
M.  Algaoud’s  Islamic  Banking.  Zubair  Iqbal  and  Abbas  Mirakhor’s 
Islamic  Banking  is  another  influential  study.  (For  further  information  and

Chapter  4.  Government  and  Politics 


The  Presidential  Palace  in  Khartoum,  executive  headquarters  of  the 
national  government 


EARLY  IN  2005,  SUDAN’S  GOVERNMENT  reached  a  significant  mile¬ 
stone  as  Khartoum  and  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement  (SPLM) 
signed  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  (CPA)  on  January  9.  After 
the  signing,  the  SPLM  leader  John  Garang  de  Mabior,  since  deceased, 
described  the  agreement  as  just  and  honorable,  adding  that  it  would  change 
Sudan  forever.  The  agreement  officially  ended  a  civil  war  that  had  resumed 
in  the  summer  of  1983  and  an  Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Develop¬ 
ment  (IGAD)  peace  process  that  began  in  1993  and  advanced  in  fits  and 
starts.  A  major  provision  of  the  accord  gave  the  people  of  South  Sudan  the 
right  to  vote  for  secession  from  Sudan  at  the  end  of  a  six-year  period  under 
a  unified  interim  government.  A  protocol  on  power  sharing  divided  power 
primarily  between  the  National  Congress  Party  and  the  SPLM,  but  it  left 
some  room  for  other  Northern  and  Southern  political  parties  to  join  the 
new  government.  Both  sides  experienced  numerous  obstacles  in  their 
efforts  to  implement  this  complex  and  far-reaching  agreement. 

The  peace  agreement  with  the  SPLM  did  not  deal  with  serious  gover¬ 
nance  issues  in  Eastern  and  Western  Sudan.  The  outbreak  of  violence  in 
Darfur  in  Lebruary  2003  could  be  attributed  in  part  to  the  success  that  the 
Southerners  achieved  as  a  result  of  their  war  with  Khartoum.  Conflict 
also  increased  in  the  area  along  Sudan’s  eastern  border  with  Eritrea,  but  a 
2006  agreement  brokered  with  the  assistance  of  Eritrea  significantly 
reduced  tension  in  this  region.  Other  marginalized  groups  throughout 
Sudan  also  sought  a  voice  in  national  affairs.  Territory  that  radiated  about 
300  kilometers  north  and  south  of  Khartoum  along  the  Nile  River  and 
extending  a  similar  distance  east  and  west  of  the  Nile  was  the  traditional 
heartland  of  Sudan.  This  was  the  area  where  the  government  exercised 
real  control  and  devoted  most  of  its  resources.  Outside  this  core  region, 
government  control  decreased  with  distance.  Most  persons  living  at  the 
peripheries  of  Sudan  never  felt  they  were  an  integral  part  of  the  country. 
It  is  not  surprising  that  Sudanese  in  other  parts  of  Sudan  followed  the 
Southerners  by  putting  increasing  pressure  on  Khartoum  to  share  equita¬ 
bly  both  power  and  resources. 

Sudan  obtained  independence  from  Britain  and  Egypt  on  January  1, 
1956.  It  subsequently  experienced  political  instability  and  a  variety  of 
regimes.  Indeed,  after  independence,  government  in  Sudan  was  charac¬ 
terized  by  the  military  periodically  stepping  in  to  seize  power  from  civil¬ 
ian  regimes  only  to  find  that  it  could  not  remain  in  control  permanently. 

Sudan’s  latest  experiment  with  democratic  rule  ended  with  another  mil¬ 
itary  coup  on  June  30,  1989,  which  brought  Colonel  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad 
al-Bashir  to  power.  His  government  was  long  characterized  by  autocratic 


223 


Sudan:  A  Countiy  Study 


rule  and  an  internal  power  struggle  between  those  who  supported  him  and 
those  who  favored  the  Islamist  leader  Hassan  Abdallah  al-Turabi.  The  al- 
Bashir  government  cracked  down  hard  on  opposition  elements  while  per¬ 
mitting  the  trappings  of  democratic  institutions,  such  as  a  new  constitution, 
a  national  legislature,  and  national  elections  such  as  those  in  1996  and 
2000  that  major  opposition  parties  boycotted.  Somewhat  more  meaningful 
elections  occurred  in  April  2010  when  al-Bashir  again  won  the  presidency, 
although  several  key  parties  boycotted  them  and  most  international 
observers  found  widespread  discrepancies. 

Relations  between  Sudan  and  the  West,  especially  the  United  States, 
have  been  strained  ever  since  al-Bashir  took  power.  The  United  States  has 
expressed  concern  over  Sudan’s  support  for  terrorist  groups,  unhappiness 
about  its  policies  on  human  rights  and  sharia,  and  displeasure  with  its  han¬ 
dling  of  the  crisis  in  Darfur  and  with  the  war  in  the  South  until  there  was  a 
cease-fire  in  2002.  Sudanese  oil  production  also  became  an  important  fea¬ 
ture  of  the  political  dynamic  by  the  beginning  of  the  twenty-first  century. 
The  People’s  Republic  of  China,  India,  and  Malaysia  became  major  devel¬ 
opers  and  buyers  of  Sudan’s  oil,  resulting  in  new  allies  for  Khartoum.  The 
September  11,  2001,  attacks  on  the  United  States  by  al-Qaeda  caused 
Sudan  to  reassess  its  links  with  terrorist  groups  and  to  increase  cooperation 
on  counterterrorism  with  Washington. 

Early  in  2011,  implementation  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agree¬ 
ment  that  ended  the  war  between  the  North  and  the  South  and  the  continu¬ 
ing  but  reduced  violence  in  Darfur  in  Western  Sudan  were  the  overriding 
issues  for  the  Khartoum  government.  Following  signature  of  the  CPA 
with  South  Sudan,  Khartoum  began  the  process  of  creating  a  new  govern¬ 
ment  that  included  significant  Southern  representation.  As  the  process 
neared  an  end  and  with  the  prospect  of  an  independent  South  Sudan,  it 
still  faced  several  serious  challenges  and  unforeseen  consequences.  In  the 
meantime,  there  appeared  to  be  no  early  solution  to  the  violence,  dis¬ 
placed  persons,  refugees,  and  human-rights  abuses  in  Darfur. 

The  al-Bashir  Era 

The  leaders  of  the  1 989  coup  that  installed  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al- 
Bashir  abolished  executive  and  legislative  institutions,  suspended  the  con¬ 
stitution,  arrested  many  prominent  civilian  politicians,  banned  political 
parties,  and  restricted  freedom  of  the  press.  They  purged  hundreds  of  army 
personnel,  senior  civil  servants,  and  teachers  perceived  as  being  insuffi¬ 
ciently  Islamic  and  announced  in  1 990  that  sharia  would  be  applied  in  the 
North.  They  established  the  Revolutionary  Command  Council  (RCC), 
which  initially  became  Sudan’s  legislative  authority.  The  chairman  of  the 
15-member  RCC  was  al-Bashir,  who  immediately  promoted  himself  to 
lieutenant  general  and  served  as  prime  minister,  minister  of  defense,  and

commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces.  All  members  of  the  RCC  were 
middle-  and  lower-ranking  military  officers.  Many  of  them  had  personal 
and  ideological  ties  to  the  Islamist  political  party,  the  National  Islamic 
Front  (NIF),  led  by  Hassan  Abdallah  al-Turabi,  who  exercised  enomious 
power  in  the  government  but  had  no  official  position  until  1996.  Although 
al-Bashir  remained  in  charge  of  the  government,  it  became  increasingly 
apparent  that  al-Turabi  led  a  shadow  regime. 

From  the  beginning,  al-Bashir  and  al-Turabi  used  each  other  to 
achieve  their  objectives.  Al-Bashir  also  played  the  al-Turabi  faction  of 
the  NIF  against  another  element  led  by  Ali  Uthman  Muhammad  Taha. 
The  RCC  appointed  a  Transitional  National  Assembly  in  1992  as  a  legis¬ 
lative  authority  pending  the  election  of  a  legislative  chamber.  The  RCC 
dissolved  itself  in  1 993  and  appointed  al-Bashir  as  president  of  Sudan.  In 
1995  al-Bashir  approved  a  constitutional  decree  that  provided  for  the 
election  of  a  National  Assembly  and  president  of  the  republic.  Elections 
in  March  1996  confirmed  al-Bashir  as  president  and  returned  a  parlia¬ 
ment  dominated  by  the  National  Congress  Party  (NCP),  the  successor  to 
the  NIF.  Al-Turabi  became  the  speaker  of  the  new  assembly.  Sudan’s  tra¬ 
ditional  political  groups  refused  to  participate  in  a  process  they  judged  to 
be  illegitimate.  Al-Bashir  and  al-Turabi  effectively  froze  them  out  of  any 
possibility  of  achieving  power  through  the  electoral  process. 

Three  central  objectives  determined  government  policies  in  the  early 
1990s:  to  turn  Sudan  into  an  Islamic  republic  as  soon  as  possible;  to  use 
military  force  rather  than  negotiation  to  end  the  war  in  the  South;  and  to 
repress  all  dissent  in  order  to  maintain  control.  Sudan  also  stepped  up 


225 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


its  support  for  international  terrorist  groups.  Osama  bin  Laden  moved 
his  headquarters  from  Afghanistan  to  Sudan  late  in  1991  and  remained 
until  the  government  asked  him  to  leave  in  mid- 1996.  These  policies 
led  to  a  decision  by  the  United  States  in  1 993  to  add  Sudan  to  the  list  of 
states  that  sponsor  terrorism.  Egypt  and  Ethiopia  implicated  Sudan  in 
the  attempted  assassination  of  Egyptian  president  Husni  Mubarak  while 
he  was  visiting  Addis  Ababa  in  1995.  In  addition,  the  government  in 
Khartoum  tried  to  export  its  Islamist  ideology  to  neighboring  countries. 
As  a  result,  Sudan’s  relations  with  Egypt,  Uganda,  Ethiopia,  and  Eritrea 
deteriorated  sharply  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s.  They  soon  recovered 
with  Egypt  and  later  with  Uganda,  Ethiopia,  and  Eritrea,  following  the 
outbreak  of  war  in  1998  between  the  latter  two  countries. 

The  war  in  South  Sudan  dominated  most  of  the  1990s,  and  the 
development  of  its  oil  resources  by  the  end  of  the  century  began  to  pro¬ 
vide  Khartoum  revenue  to  continue  the  civil  war.  The  al-Bashir  gov¬ 
ernment  also  spent  much  of  the  1 990s  defending  its  poor  human-rights 
record  and  working  to  ensure  that  opposition  groups  could  not  achieve 
power.  By  1996  al-Turabi  sought  to  build  alliances  with  social  forces 
that  would  allow  him  to  assume  autonomous  political  power  and  cast 
himself  as  a  reformist  leader  who  expressed  the  voice  of  the  people.  As 
speaker  of  parliament  and  secretary-general  of  the  NCP,  al-Turabi  was 
a  growing  threat  to  al-Bashir. 

The  power  struggle  between  al-Bashir  and  al-Turabi  reached  a  crisis 
by  1999.  Al-Bashir  suspended  parts  of  the  constitution,  dissolved  par¬ 
liament  and,  hence,  al-Turabi’s  role  as  speaker,  and  declared  a  state  of 
emergency.  In  May  2000,  al-Bashir  rescinded  al-Turabi’s  appointment 
as  secretary-general  of  the  ruling  NCP  and  stated  that  al-Turabi  and  his 
followers  were  trying  to  undermine  the  government.  Al-Turabi  accused 
al-Bashir  of  leading  the  country  down  a  dangerous  path.  In  the  Decem¬ 
ber  2000  election,  which  was  boycotted  by  most  opposition  parties,  al- 
Bashir  won  an  overwhelming  victory.  Continuing  tension  between  al- 
Bashir  and  al-Turabi  led  early  in  2001  to  the  arrest  of  al-Turabi  and  four 
of  his  aides  for  conspiring  to  depose  al-Bashir.  A  few  months  later,  al- 
Bashir  released  al-Turabi  from  prison  and  put  him  under  house  arrest. 
The  two  then  patched  up  their  differences,  and  al-Bashir  released  al- 
Turabi  from  house  arrest  in  2003  and  allowed  him  to  return  to  politics. 
Al-Bashir  rearrested  al-Turabi  and  about  70  key  supporters  in  March 
2004  for  an  alleged  plot  to  topple  him.  He  also  banned  political  activity 
by  al-Turabi’s  party.  Al-Bashir  eventually  released  al-Turabi  again. 

Relations  with  Europe  began  to  improve  by  the  late  1990s.  Following 
the  September  11,  2001,  attacks  against  the  United  States,  Sudan  decided 
to  improve  cooperation  with  the  United  States  on  counterterrorism.  The 
most  important  change  in  Khartoum’s  policy,  however,  was  a  decision  to 


226 


Government  and  Politics 


negotiate  an  end  to  the  war  with  the  South.  This  process  achieved  success 
in  January  2005  following  two  years  of  negotiations  with  the  SPLM, 
when  Sudan  began  to  create  a  new  government  that  included  significant 
Southern  representation.  Implementing  the  CPA  became,  however,  an 
enormous  challenge  for  both  Khartoum  and  the  SPLM.  In  the  meantime, 
the  crisis  that  broke  out  in  February  2003  in  Darfur  posed  a  serious  new 
setback  to  internal  stability  and  Sudan’s  international  standing.  On  the 
positive  side,  there  was  no  return  to  war  between  Khartoum  and  South 
Sudan,  and  violence  decreased  significantly  in  Darfur.  Controversial 
national  elections  in  April  2010  kept  the  door  open  for  the  vote  by  South¬ 
erners  in  January  2011,  in  which  they  opted  for  independence  from  the 
North. 

On  March  4,  2009,  the  International  Criminal  Court  (ICC)  issued  an 
arrest  warrant  for  al-Bashir  as  an  indirect  perpetrator  or  as  an  indirect 
co-perpetrator  of  five  counts  of  crimes  against  humanity — murder, 
extermination,  forcible  transfer,  torture,  and  rape — and  two  counts  of 
war  crimes — intentionally  directing  attacks  against  a  civilian  population 
or  against  individual  civilians  not  taking  part  in  hostilities,  and  pillaging 
in  Darfur  between  March  2003  and  July  2008.  The  ICC  later  added  the 
charge  of  genocide.  Most  Arab  and  many  African  governments  stood 
by  al-Bashir,  although  he  has  had  to  significantly  limit  his  international 
travel  so  as  to  avoid  arrest. 

Institutions  of  Government 

Following  the  military  coup  in  1989,  there  was  significant  change  in 
Sudanese  government  institutions  and  in  the  movement  of  key  persons 
who  direct  those  institutions.  One  constant  was  President  al-Bashir. 
Another  was  the  critical  role  played  behind  the  scenes  by  the  military 
and  security  forces  in  maintaining  the  government  in  power.  A  third  was 
the  important  and  sometimes  conflictive  position  that  Islam  held  in  a 
government  representing  a  diverse  society.  Some  experts  believed  the 
Islamist  model  had  run  its  course;  others  were  not  convinced.  Finally, 
there  was  the  highly  circumscribed  role  permitted  for  institutions  and 
practices  judged  as  democratic  by  Western  governments.  The  impact  of 
Sudan’s  1998  constitution  and  the  federal  system  that  it  created,  as  mod¬ 
ified  by  the  2005  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  continued  to  unfold 
in  the  North  in  early  2011. 

The  primary  institutions  of  the  central  government  are  the  presidency, 
the  National  Council  of  Ministers,  and  the  bicameral  National  Legisla¬ 
ture,  or  parliament.  The  civil  service  is  subservient  to  the  central  govern¬ 
ment;  South  Sudan  had  a  separate  civil  service.  Sudan  also  has  an 
elaborate  system  of  state  and  local  government.  The  CPA  between  the 
central  government  and  the  SPLM  signed  on  January  9, 2005,  in  Nairobi, 


227 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Kenya,  was  based  on  a  series  of  individual  protocols  that  significantly 
changed  the  system  of  governance  in  Sudan  in  the  next  few  years.  It  also 
resulted  in  the  new  Interim  National  Constitution  of  the  Republic  ot  the 
Sudan  and  an  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan,  both  taking  effect  in 
2005.  Most  importantly,  it  provided  for  national  elections  in  2009  (post¬ 
poned  until  2010)  and  a  referendum  on  self-determination  for  South 
Sudan  that  occurred  in  January  2011. 

Recent  Constitutional  Developments 

The  military  coup  of  April  6,  1985,  led  to  suspension  of  Sudan’s  1973 
constitution  and  its  replacement  with  an  interim  constitution  later  in  the 
year.  One  of  the  first  acts  of  the  RCC  after  seizing  power  in  1989  was  to 
abolish  the  interim  constitution.  Al-Bashir  promised  to  prepare  a  new 
constitution.  It  was  not  until  January  1998,  however,  that  Sudan  convened 
a  constitutional  conference  to  draft  a  constitution.  It  consisted  of  legal  and 
political  scholars  representing  different  political  groups  sympathetic  to  al- 
Bashir’s  rule.  The  Umma  Party  and  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party 
refused  to  participate.  Most  Southerners  boycotted  the  conference.  Voters 
in  Sudan’s  single-party  system  approved  the  constitution  in  a  1998  refer¬ 
endum,  a  process  that  raised  questions  about  the  degree  to  which  the  pub¬ 
lic  accepted  the  document. 

The  constitution  entered  into  force  on  July  1,  1998.  A  significant  fea¬ 
ture  of  the  individual-rights  provisions  of  the  1 998  constitution  was  the 
frequent  use  of  the  qualifier  “in  accordance  with  law”  attached  to  most 
freedoms.  On  the  other  hand,  there  was  no  requirement  that  only  Mus¬ 
lims  could  hold  public  office,  including  the  office  of  president.  Non- 
Muslims  were  free  to  practice,  convert,  and  doubt  the  main  tenets  of  their 
religion  as  long  as  they  did  not  interfere  with  the  spiritual  life  of  Mus¬ 
lims.  There  were,  nevertheless,  inherent  conflicts  between  Sudan’s 
Islamic  political  system  and  the  way  in  which  Muslims  applied  the  prin¬ 
ciples  of  shura  (see  Glossary).  The  constitution  attempted  to  balance  a 
strong  preference  for  Islamic  beliefs  and  a  grudging  acceptance  of  inter¬ 
nationally  accepted  human  rights.  In  1999  dissenting  members  of  the 
National  Assembly  tried  to  amend  the  constitution  by  restricting  the  pres¬ 
ident’s  involvement  in  the  selection  of  candidates  for  governors  of  the 
federal  states.  Speaker  of  the  National  Assembly  al-Turabi  supported  the 
amendment,  but  the  proposal  led  al-Bashir  to  dissolve  the  National 
Assembly  (the  lower  house  of  the  legislature)  and  declare  a  state  of 
emergency  under  the  constitution.  These  steps  had  the  effect  of  suspend¬ 
ing  the  decentralization  process  stipulated  in  the  constitution  and  gave  al- 
Bashir  full  authority  over  the  states.  Legislators  supporting  al-Turabi 
challenged  the  state  of  emergency  before  the  Constitutional  Court,  which 
concluded  that  al-Bashir ’s  actions  were  constitutional. 


228 


Government  and  Politics 


On  May  26, 2004,  the  government  and  the  SPLM  signed  the  Protocol 
on  Power  Sharing,  later  part  of  the  CPA.  The  protocol  provided  for  a 
National  Constitutional  Review  Commission  (NCRC)  composed  of  rep¬ 
resentatives  from  the  NCP,  SPLM,  other  political  forces,  and  civil  soci¬ 
ety.  It  was  charged  with  preparing  a  legal  and  constitutional  framework 
based  on  the  peace  agreement  and  the  1998  constitution  for  adoption  by 
the  National  Assembly  and  the  SPLM.  The  result  was  the  Interim 
National  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Sudan,  which  the  National 
Assembly  and  the  SPLM  National  Liberation  Council  adopted  on  July 
6,  2005.  For  its  part,  the  Government  of  South  Sudan  (GOSS)  then 
adopted  on  December  5,  2005,  an  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan 
that  did  not  contradict  any  of  the  provisions  contained  in  the  Interim 
National  Constitution.  The  NCRC  prepared  a  model  constitution  for  all 
25  states,  compatible  with  both  the  Interim  National  Constitution  and 
the  one  for  South  Sudan.  The  states  of  South  Sudan  adopted  their  own 
constitutions,  which  had  to  conform  to  both  interim  constitutions. 
Before  the  end  of  the  six-year  interim  period  mandated  by  the  CPA,  the 
NCRC  was  also  responsible  for  organizing  an  inclusive  constitutional- 
review  process.  According  to  the  Interim  National  Constitution,  the  cru¬ 
cial  six-year  interim  period  began  officially  on  July  9,  2005. 

Both  the  Interim  National  Constitution  and  the  Interim  Constitution 
of  South  Sudan  authorized  the  15  states  in  the  North  and  the  10  states  in 
South  Sudan  to  have  their  own  constitutions.  States  in  the  North  began 
the  constitutional  drafting  process  in  mid-2005  based  on  a  model  consti¬ 
tution  drafted  by  a  subcommittee  of  the  National  Constitutional  Review 
Commission.  The  most  controversial  process  was  in  Khartoum  State 
where  there  were  concerns  about  the  rights  of  non-Muslims  and  human 
rights  generally.  Blue  Nile  and  South  Kordofan  States,  disputed  areas 
that  are  also  strategically  located,  posed  problems  for  the  constitutional- 
development  process.  The  drafting  of  state  constitutions  in  the  South 
began  later  than  in  the  North  but  was  relatively  uncontroversial  because 
the  SPLM  held  a  70  percent  majority  in  the  state  legislatures  and  could 
largely  control  the  outcome. 

The  Federal  System 

During  most  of  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium  period  (1899— 
1955),  the  British  relied  on  a  system  called  indigenous  administration  to 
control  local  governments  in  rural  areas.  Under  this  system,  traditional 
tribal  and  village  leaders  held  responsibility  for  administrative  and  judicial 
functions  within  their  own  areas  and  received  financial  and,  when  neces¬ 
sary,  military  support  from  the  central  authorities.  The  British  abandoned 
this  system  in  1951  in  favor  of  a  system  of  local  government  councils.  The 
councils  were  responsible  to  the  minister  of  local  government,  whereas 


229 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


provincial  governors  and  district  commissioners  remained  under  the  super¬ 
vision  of  the  minister  of  interior.  This  division  led  to  many  difficulties. 

The  Local  Government  Act  of  1961  created  a  system  of  provincial 
commissioners  appointed  by  the  central  government  as  chairmen  of  the 
provincial  authorities,  an  executive  body  of  officials  representing  Khar¬ 
toum.  Following  the  military  coup  of  1969,  the  new  government  abol¬ 
ished  local  and  regional  government  structures  and  in  1971  created  a 
pyramidal  structure  with  local  community  councils  at  the  base  and  pro¬ 
gressively  higher  levels  of  authority  up  to  the  executive  councils  of  the 
10  provinces.  Above  the  community  councils  was  a  second  tier  of  local 
government  structures  that  included  rural  and  urban  councils.  A  third 
tier  consisted  of  sub-provincial  district  councils.  At  the  top,  a  provincial 
governor  appointed  by  Khartoum  presided  over  the  provincial  commis¬ 
sions.  In  1991  the  RCC  introduced  a  federal  structure  that  divided  the 
country  into  nine  states,  66  provinces,  and  2 1 8  local-government  areas 
or  districts.  The  RCC  appointed  a  governor,  deputy  governor,  and  coun¬ 
cil  of  ministers  for  each  state. 

The  1998  constitution  prescribed  a  federal  system  of  government 
with  the  country  divided  into  25  states,  each  with  its  own  capital.  Each 
state  had  a  governor,  called  a  wali  in  the  North,  and  a  state  assembly.  The 
federal  government  exercised  power  over  national  security,  international 
and  state  boundaries,  foreign  relations  and  trade,  immigration,  elections, 
judiciary,  currency,  federal  taxation,  land  and  natural  resources,  water¬ 
ways  and  national  electricity,  and  interstate  transportation.  The  states  had 
authority  over  state  administration,  taxes  and  fees,  trade,  land,  water  and 
electric  power,  and  road  maintenance.  The  federal  and  state  governments 
had  concurrent  jurisdiction  over  a  wide  number  of  issues,  including  the 
civil  service,  local  government,  media,  education,  health,  economic  poli¬ 
cies,  industry,  social  welfare,  environment,  and  tourism.  The  federal 
government  derived  its  revenue  primarily  from  customs  duties,  seaport 
and  airport  revenue,  corporate  taxes,  profits  from  national  projects,  and 
taxes  collected  from  Sudanese  working  abroad.  The  states  obtained  rev¬ 
enue  from  business  profits,  some  of  which  went  to  local  councils,  a  share 
of  tax  on  state  industrial  production,  state  licenses,  taxes  and  duties,  and 
profits  from  state  projects. 

The  2005  Interim  National  Constitution,  which  drew  many  princi¬ 
ples  from  the  1998  constitution  and  incoiporated  the  provisions  of  the 
CPA,  created  a  national  government  with  authority  to  protect  and  pro¬ 
mote  the  national  sovereignty  of  Sudan.  It  permitted  creation  of  a  gov¬ 
ernment  in  South  Sudan  exercising  authority  in  respect  of  the  people 
and  states  there.  The  decentralized  system  of  government  also  estab¬ 
lished  state  and  local  governments  throughout  Sudan.  The  link  between 
the  national  government  and  the  states  in  South  Sudan  was  through  the

Government  and  Politics 


Government  of  South  Sudan.  All  levels  of  government  had  to  respect 
each  others’  autonomy  and  assist  each  other  in  fulfilling  their  respec¬ 
tive  constitutional  obligations.  The  constitution  permitted  freedom  of 
religion  and  declared  its  respect  for  the  promotion  and  development  of 
all  indigenous  languages.  At  the  national  level,  it  established  Arabic 
and  English  as  the  official  working  languages.  In  2009,  South  Sudan 
passed  the  Local  Government  Act,  which  specified  the  different  kinds 
of  local  government. 

The  Interim  National  Constitution  contained  an  extensive  bill  of 
rights.  It  detailed  the  powers  reserved  to  the  national  government,  South 
Sudan  government,  states,  and  concurrent  powers.  The  national  govern¬ 
ment  was  responsible  for,  among  other  areas,  security,  defense,  foreign 
affairs,  nationality  and  naturalization,  currency,  national  police,  civil  avi¬ 
ation,  central  banks,  customs,  national  debt,  national  states  of  emer¬ 
gency,  interstate  transport,  and  national  taxation  and  budget  matters.  The 
South  established  a  Bank  of  South  Sudan  as  a  branch  of  the  national 
Bank  of  Sudan.  It  offered  conventional  banking  services  within  the 
framework  of  a  single  national  monetary  policy.  GOSS  controlled  its 
own  police,  military  during  the  interim  period,  legislation,  borrowing  of 
money,  planning,  and  civil  service  relating  to  the  administration  of  South 
Sudan.  The  Interim  National  Constitution  also  reserved  numerous  lesser 
responsibilities  to  GOSS.  Other  states  in  Sudan  had  somewhat  lower 
responsibilities.  They  included  control  over  the  police,  local  govern¬ 
ment,  the  civil  service  at  the  state  level,  social  welfare,  cultural  matters, 
regulation  of  religion,  and  a  host  of  other  issues.  The  national  govern¬ 
ment,  Government  of  South  Sudan,  and  state  governments  had  a  number 
of  concurrent  powers,  including  tertiary  education,  health  policy,  com¬ 
merce,  delivery  of  public  services,  banking  and  insurance,  traffic  regula¬ 
tions,  and  gender  policy. 

On  December  5,  2005,  South  Sudan  adopted  its  own  Interim  Consti¬ 
tution,  which  was  longer  and  more  detailed  than  the  Interim  National 
Constitution.  Like  the  latter,  it  proclaimed  the  boundary  of  South  Sudan 
as  the  one  that  existed  at  Sudan’s  independence  on  January  1,  1956.  It 
divided  the  territory  into  10  states  to  be  governed  on  the  basis  of  decen¬ 
tralization.  It  stated  explicitly  that  South  Sudan  is  a  multiethnic,  multi¬ 
cultural,  multilingual,  multireligious,  and  multiracial  state.  English  and 
Arabic  were  designated  as  the  official  working  languages,  but  all  indige¬ 
nous  languages  in  South  Sudan  were  to  be  considered  national  lan¬ 
guages.  It  treated  all  religions  equally  and  did  not  establish  an  official 
religion.  The  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  separated  religion  and 
state.  It  underscored  a  provision  in  the  Interim  National  Constitution, 
which  stated  that  six  months  before  the  end  of  the  six-year  interim 
period  there  would  be  an  internationally  monitored  referendum  for  the

people  of  South  Sudan  to  either  confirm  the  unity  of  Sudan  or  vote  for 
secession. 

Governance  in  Sudan  had  traditionally  been  seen  as  a  North-South 
problem.  By  the  1980s,  however,  it  became  apparent  that  separatist  ten¬ 
dencies  were  not  confined  to  the  South.  The  tensions  in  Darfur  in  the 
West  and  among  the  Beja  in  the  East  also  threatened  to  pull  the  country 
apart.  The  Nubians  along  the  northern  Nile  and  the  Nuba  in  South  Kor- 
dofan  also  had  significant  grievances.  For  that  matter,  separatist  ten¬ 
dencies  began  to  develop  within  South  Sudan  after  Southerners  took 
charge  of  their  own  government.  These  separatist  proclivities  had  long 
existed  among  ethnic  groups  in  Equatoria  in  the  far  south  and  between 
the  Dinka  and  the  Nuer  people. 

The  agreement  between  Khartoum  and  the  SPLM  provided  an 
opportunity  to  solve  the  differences  between  the  North  and  South,  but  it 
also  raised  serious  challenges  as  Sudanese  in  both  parts  of  the  country 
tried  to  implement  the  CPA.  The  agreement  shifted  attention  to  periph¬ 
eral  regions,  especially  in  Western  Sudan  and  Eastern  Sudan,  which 
also  requested  new  arrangements  with  Khartoum.  It  raised  the  question 
of  whether  federalism  could  prevent  Sudan  from  disintegrating  into  a 
number  of  independent  parts.  In  2006  one  key  rebel  group  in  Darfur 
signed  a  highly  flawed  peace  agreement  with  Khartoum  that  did  not 
end  the  violence.  By  late  20 1 0,  there  were  even  more  political  factions 
in  Darfur.  The  2006  peace  agreement  in  Eastern  Sudan  was  more  suc¬ 
cessful  but  also  remained  tenuous. 

Elections 

The  interim  military  government  of  Abd  al-Rahman  Si  war  al-Dhahab 
authorized  general  elections  in  Sudan  in  April  1986.  They  were  among 
the  freest  and  fairest  elections  in  Africa  up  to  that  time,  except  for  the 
fact  that  civil  war  prevented  balloting  in  most  of  South  Sudan.  Sadiq  al- 
Mahdi’s  Umma  Party  won  the  largest  number  of  votes  and  formed  a 
coalition  government  in  June.  Following  al-Mahdi’s  overthrow  in  1989, 
the  RCC  appointed  a  Transitional  National  Assembly  in  1992.  The  al- 
Bashir  government  held  its  first  presidential  and  parliamentary  elections 
in  March  1996.  Of  the  National  Assembly’s  400  members,  125  had  pre¬ 
viously  been  selected  during  a  national  conference  in  February.  About 
900  candidates  vied  for  the  remaining  275  seats,  although  51  of  these 
seats  were  uncontested.  Al-Bashir  faced  40  challengers  for  president.  All 
candidates  ran  in  an  individual  capacity.  Al-Bashir  and  his  supporters 
won  handily.  Opposition  groups  boycotted  the  elections,  claiming  they 
were  unfair.  Because  of  the  civil  war,  no  voting  took  place  in  1 1  South¬ 
ern  districts. 


232 


Government  and  Politics 


National  elections  took  place  again  in  December  2000.  About  66  per¬ 
cent  of  Sudan’s  eligible  voters  cast  ballots.  Major  opposition  parties, 
including  Umma,  Democratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP),  and  Popular 
National  Congress  (later  renamed  the  Popular  Congress  Party — PCP) 
led  by  al-Turabi,  boycotted  the  elections,  accusing  the  government  of 
vote  rigging.  Only  al-Bashir’s  NCP  and  a  small  number  of  minority  par¬ 
ties  contested  the  elections.  Al-Bashir  received  86.5  percent  of  the  votes 
cast  for  a  five-year  presidential  term.  Former  President  al-Numayri,  who 
had  returned  to  Sudan  from  exile  in  Egypt,  polled  9.6  percent  of  the 
vote,  and  three  other  candidates  received  less  than  4  percent  among 
them.  Voters  also  elected  275  members  of  the  National  Assembly  to 
four-year  terms.  The  ruling  NCP  won  all  but  10  seats;  no  other  party 
contested  112  of  the  seats.  Of  the  90  specially  selected  positions,  35 
went  to  women,  26  to  university  graduates,  and  29  to  trade  union  repre¬ 
sentatives.  Women  constituted  about  10  percent  of  the  legislature’s 
membership.  An  Organization  of  African  Unity  observer  team  con¬ 
cluded  “that  the  overall  exercise  was  an  important  step  towards  democ¬ 
ratization  and  that  it  was  conducted  in  a  conducive  atmosphere  and  in  a 
satisfactory  manner.”  Political  parties  that  boycotted  the  elections  had  a 
decidedly  different  view. 

Following  the  CPA,  elections  initially  did  not  play  a  role  in  determin¬ 
ing  the  composition  of  the  interim  national  government,  the  South 
Sudan  government,  or  the  state  legislatures.  An  out  of  date  national  cen¬ 
sus  and,  in  the  case  of  South  Sudan,  a  complete  lack  of  infrastructure  for 
conducting  an  election,  rendered  the  electoral  process  moot.  As  a  result, 
all  government  officials  and  all  governing  bodies  consisted  of  appointed 
officials  until  the  completion  of  a  census  in  2008  and  national  elections 
in  2010.  The  SPLM  rejected  the  results  of  the  census,  claiming  that  it 
underestimated  populations  in  the  South.  The  National  Elections  Act  of 
2008  provided  the  legal  framework  for  conducting  elections  in  Sudan, 
South  Sudan,  and  in  each  state.  The  National  Elections  Commission 
was  responsible  for  developing  the  regulations,  rules,  and  orders  for  the 
election  of  the  national  president,  South  Sudan  president,  state  gover¬ 
nors,  National  Assembly,  South  Sudan  Legislative  Assembly,  and  state 
assemblies. 

Sudan  held  national  elections  on  April  11-19,  2010.  At  the  last  min¬ 
ute,  the  Umma  Party  withdrew,  and  the  SPLM  candidate  for  the  national 
presidency,  Yasir  Annan,  declared  he  was  no  longer  seeking  the  posi¬ 
tion.  As  the  ballots  had  already  been  printed,  however,  their  names 
remained.  Al-Bashir  won  just  over  68  percent  of  the  vote  for  president. 
Yasir  Arman  won  almost  22  percent,  PCP  candidate  Abdullah  Deng 
Nhial  won  almost  4  percent,  and  DUP  candidate  Hatim  al-Sir  took  2 
percent.  All  of  the  other  candidates  obtained  less  than  1  percent  each. 


233 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  SPLM  candidate,  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  won  93  percent  of  the  vote 
for  the  presidency  of  South  Sudan,  and  his  challenger,  Lam  Akol  from 
the  SPLM-Democratic  Change,  won  7  percent.  Although  monitors  from 
the  African  Union  and  Arab  League  gave  the  elections  a  passing  mark, 
those  from  the  Carter  Center  and  more  than  4,000  Sudanese  representa¬ 
tives  of  civil  society  in  both  the  North  and  South  declared  the  elections 
had  serious  flaws.  The  United  States  and  European  Union  said  they  did 
not  meet  international  standards. 

Corruption  and  Governance  Issues 

Corruption  has  long  been  a  problem  throughout  Sudan.  The  sharp 
rise  in  oil  revenue  contributed  significantly  to  the  challenge.  Out  of  1 80 
countries  ranked  in  2009,  the  Transparency  International  Corruption 
Perceptions  Index  placed  Sudan  in  position  176,  or  fifth  from  the  bot¬ 
tom.  Sudan  also  scored  poorly  on  the  2006  Global  Integrity  Index, 
which  assesses  the  existence  of  anticorruption  mechanisms  that  promote 
public  integrity.  Sudan  ranked  in  the  lowest  quintile  in  the  overall  cate¬ 
gory.  It  fell  in  the  lowest  category  that  considered  voting  and  citizen  par¬ 
ticipation,  the  integrity  of  elections,  and  regulations  concerning  political 
financing;  the  lowest  category  for  accountability  across  the  executive, 
legislative,  and  judicial  branches  of  government  as  well  as  the  budget 
process;  the  lowest  category  for  oversight  and  regulatory  mechanisms 
such  as  a  national  ombudsman,  auditing,  taxes  and  customs,  financial- 
sector  regulation,  and  business  licensing;  and  the  lowest  category  for 
anticorruption  and  mle  of  law.  It  did  better  in  the  category  considering 
administration  and  civil-service  regulations,  whistle-blowing  measures, 
and  regulatory  processes  around  procurement  and  privatization.  It  also 
did  somewhat  better  on  anticorruption  laws,  its  anticorruption  agency, 
access  to  justice,  and  law  enforcement.  An  auditor’s  report  on  fiscal  year 
2008  found  that  unnamed  persons  embezzled  US$2.3  billion  from  gov¬ 
ernment  institutions. 

South  Sudan  was  also  plagued  by  corruption,  which  contributed  to 
the  collapse  of  the  1972  peace  agreement  with  Khartoum.  Probably 
recalling  this  history,  South  Sudan’s  President  Salva  Kiir  launched  a 
major  anticorruption  campaign  following  allegations  of  rampant  cor¬ 
ruption.  He  relieved  a  number  of  senior  officials,  including  the  minister 
of  finance,  of  their  posts  and  asked  them  to  answer  charges  of  embez¬ 
zlement  and  bribery,  including  the  alleged  embezzlement  of  US$60  mil¬ 
lion  transferred  to  the  SPLM  by  the  NCP  soon  after  signing  the  CPA. 
South  Sudan  officials  often  engaged  in  corrupt  practices  with  impunity, 
and  corruption  was  a  problem  in  all  branches  of  the  government. 

In  an  especially  embarrassing  ranking,  Foreign  Policy  magazine  and 
the  Fund  for  Peace,  an  independent  research  organization,  looked  at  12

economic,  political,  and  military  indicators  in  an  evaluation  of  the 
world’s  60  most- failed  states  in  2010.  They  assessed  state  vulnerability 
to  violent  internal  conflict  and  social  deterioration.  Sudan  ranked  num¬ 
ber  three,  after  Somalia  and  Chad.  Sudan  scored  particularly  low  in  the 
following  categories:  refugees  and  internally  displaced  persons,  group 
grievance,  delegitimization  of  the  state,  human  rights,  and  external 
intervention. 

The  Presidency 

Sudan  has  gravitated  between  elected  presidents  and  those  who 
seized  power  by  force  ever  since  it  became  independent  in  1956.  Some 
of  the  elections  were  highly  suspect.  Al-Bashir  in  2011  had  been 
Sudan’s  only  president  since  the  military  coup  in  1989.  Bom  in  1944, 
he  was  at  the  time  of  the  coup  the  commander  of  a  paratroop  brigade  in 
South  Sudan.  He  returned  to  Khartoum  with  175  paratroopers  just  a  few 
days  before  the  coup.  Al-Bashir ’s  governing  authority  varied  over  time. 
He  ruled  initially  through  the  RCC,  declared  himself  president  in  1993, 
and  orchestrated  elections  in  1996  and  again  in  2000.  His  authority 
changed  again  after  approval  of  the  Interim  National  Constitution  in 
2005. 

Under  the  Interim  National  Constitution,  the  presidency  consisted  of 
the  president  and  two  vice  presidents.  The  elections  of  2010  continued 
this  arrangement;  al-Bashir  remained  as  president  of  Sudan  and  com¬ 
mander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces.  The  president  of  South  Sudan, 
Salva  Kiir,  following  the  death  of  John  Garang  in  a  helicopter  accident, 
became  the  first  vice  president  of  the  new  Government  of  National 
Unity  effective  on  August  4, 2005.  Salva  Kiir  also  served  as  commander 
in  chief  of  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Army.  A  Northerner,  Ali  Uth- 
man  Muhammad  Taha,  became  the  second  vice  president  on  September 
20,  2005.  The  outcome  of  the  referendum  on  self-determination  meant 
that  al-Bashir  continued  in  office  as  president  of  the  Northern  govern¬ 
ment,  and  there  would  no  longer  be  a  Southerner  as  first  vice  president 
after  mid-20 1 1 .  Three  other  key  officials  in  the  presidency  were  senior 
advisers  to  the  president.  The  most  senior  until  December  2010  was 
Minni  Arkoi  Minnawi,  a  leader  of  the  Sudan  Liberation  Movement  in 
Darfur  who  signed  the  May  5,  2006,  Darfur  Peace  Agreement.  The  two 
others  were  Nafie  Ali  Nafie,  a  Northerner  who  held  numerous  senior 
positions  in  the  al-Bashir  government,  and  Musa  Mohamed  Ahmed,  an 
Eastern  Front  leader  and  special  assistant  to  al-Bashir. 

The  people  directly  elect  the  president  of  Sudan.  Eligible  candidates 
must  be  of  Sudanese  nationality,  of  sound  mind,  literate,  and  at  least  40 
years  of  age.  There  are  no  religious  or  gender  restrictions.  The  presidential 
term  is  five  years,  and  a  president  can  only  be  reelected  once  following  the 


235 


Sudan :  A  Country  Study 


2010  election.  The  president  has  wide-ranging  power  and  serves  as  both 
chief  of  state  and  head  of  government.  He  is  commander  in  chief  ot  all 
security  forces  and  supervises  foreign  relations,  the  judiciary,  justice  and 
public  morals,  constitutional  institutions,  and  economic  development  of 
the  country.  The  president  appoints  personnel  for  federal  office,  presides 
over  the  National  Council  of  Ministers,  summons  or  adjourns  the  National 
Legislature,  can  declare  war  and  a  state  of  emergency,  approve  death  sen¬ 
tences  and  grant  pardons,  and  initiate  amendments  to  the  constitution.  The 
constitution  gave  the  president,  with  the  consent  of  the  first  vice  president, 
the  authority  to  declare  a  state  of  emergency.  The  declaration  must  be  sub¬ 
mitted  within  15  days  to  the  National  Legislature  for  approval.  Once 
approved  by  the  National  Legislature,  the  president  can  suspend  the  pow¬ 
ers  of  states  and  take  over  those  powers;  he  can  suspend  the  provisions 
pertaining  to  individual  rights,  with  several  specified  exceptions.  The 
president,  with  the  consent  of  the  first  vice  president,  has  virtually  unlim¬ 
ited  power  to  deal  with  a  state  of  emergency. 

The  president  appointed  two  vice  presidents  in  2005-10,  one  from 
South  Sudan  and  one  from  the  North,  who  had  to  meet  the  same  eligibil¬ 
ity  requirements  as  the  president.  The  president  was  also  able  to  appoint 
assistants  and  advisers  and  to  define  their  functions  and  responsibilities. 
The  first  vice  president  acted  in  the  absence  of  the  president  and  was  a 
member  of  the  National  Council  of  Ministers,  National  Security  Coun¬ 
cil,  and  Presidential  Council  in  the  preelection  period.  The  Presidential 
Council  consisted  of  the  two  vice  presidents  and  the  speaker  of  the 
National  Assembly;  the  council  would  assume  the  functions  of  the  presi¬ 
dent  if  that  office  fell  vacant.  The  second  vice  president  acted  in  the 
absence  of  the  president  and  first  vice  president  and  was  a  member  of  the 
same  organizations  as  the  first  vice  president.  Should  the  office  of  the 
national  president  fall  vacant,  the  second  vice  president  would  become 
commander  in  chief  of  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces.  The  constitution  had 
elaborate  provisions  in  the  event  of  a  vacancy  in  the  office  of  the  presi¬ 
dent  both  before  and  after  the  elections. 

Al-Bashir  was  not  known  for  his  ability  to  conceptualize.  He  tried  to 
rule  by  consensus  but  ultimately  made  the  key  decisions.  First  Vice 
President  Salva  Kiir  played  a  minimal  role  in  the  Government  of 
National  Unity  in  2005-10  and  instead  focused  his  energy  on  governing 
South  Sudan.  Taha’s  role  as  second  vice  president  was  significant  but 
unclear,  although  he  had  had  broad  authority  to  negotiate  the  CPA  with 
the  SPLM. 

Eligibility  requirements  for  the  president  of  South  Sudan  mirrored 
those  of  the  Interim  National  Constitution.  In  addition  to  responsibilities 
in  the  national  government,  Salva  Kiir  was  responsible  for  the  security  of 
South  Sudan,  presided  over  the  South  Sudan  Council  of  Ministers,  could 
summon  or  adjourn  the  South  Sudan  Legislative  Assembly,  declare  a

state  of  emergency  in  South  Sudan,  and  appoint  advisers.  South  Sudan’s 
vice  president,  Riek  Machar  Teny,  acted  as  president  in  the  absence  of 
the  president  and  was  a  member  of  the  South  Sudan  Council  of  Ministers 
and  the  South  Sudan  Security  Committee. 

National  Council  of  Ministers 

After  the  coup  led  by  al-Bashir  in  1989,  the  RCC  appointed  mem¬ 
bers  of  the  National  Council  of  Ministers,  which  was  also  known  as  the 
cabinet.  The  RCC  gave  al-Bashir  authority  to  appoint  and  dismiss  min¬ 
isters,  and  he  regularly  reshuffled  the  cabinet.  Before  the  CPA,  it  con¬ 
sisted  of  some  34  ministers  he  had  appointed.  Members  of  the  ruling 
NCP  dominated  the  ministerial  positions.  Al-Bashir  served  as  the  prime 
minister  on  the  council.  Less  than  7  percent  of  the  federal  ministers  and 
about  2  percent  of  state  ministers  were  women.  Because  the  ministers 
were  appointed  by  the  president,  they  were  effectively  subservient  to 
him  and  the  small  group  of  personal  advisers  who  exerted  so  much 
power  behind  closed  doors. 

Under  the  Interim  National  Constitution,  the  president,  after  consulta¬ 
tion  within  the  presidency,  appointed  the  members  of  the  National  Coun¬ 
cil  of  Ministers.  The  president  and  two  vice  presidents  were  members  of 


237 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


the  presidency  and  the  National  Council  of  Ministers.  The  presidency 
and  the  National  Council  of  Ministers  together  constituted  the  highest 
executive  body  in  Sudan’s  government.  The  interim  government  had  to 
allocate  ministerial  positions  in  accordance  with  a  70-30  North-South 
ratio:  52  percent  of  positions  for  the  NCP  (49  percent  for  Northerners 
and  3  percent  for  Southerners),  28  percent  for  the  SPLM  (21  percent  for 
Southerners  and  7  percent  for  Northerners),  14  percent  for  other  North¬ 
ern  political  forces,  and  6  percent  for  other  Southern  political  forces.  The 
first  iteration  of  this  process  was  controversial  and  did  not  follow  pre¬ 
cisely  this  formula.  Of  the  original  29  cabinet  ministers,  16  were  from  the 
NCP,  nine  from  the  SPLM,  and  four  from  other  opposition  parties.  There 
were  33  ministers  of  state  or  junior  ministers.  Southerners  were  espe¬ 
cially  unhappy  that  the  ministries  of  energy  and  mining,  finance  and 
national  economy,  finance  and  planning,  defense,  interior,  justice,  and 
prosecutor  general  went  to  the  NCP.  The  most  senior  ministry  assigned 
to  the  SPLM  was  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs. 

Following  the  April  2010  elections,  the  Government  of  National  Unity 
increased  and  reallocated  ministerial  positions.  Al-Bashir  announced  the 
appointment  of  35  federal  ministers  and  42  state  ministers.  The  NCP 
received  24  ministerial  positions  while  the  SPLM  obtained  eight,  includ¬ 
ing  the  elusive  oil  ministry.  Other  political  parties  received  three  posi¬ 
tions.  Each  minister  was  responsible  for  his  ministry  and  answerable  to 
the  president,  National  Council  of  Ministers,  and  National  Assembly. 
Ministers  were  expected  to  plan  state  policy,  implement  the  CPA,  initiate 
legislation,  and  prepare  reports. 

South  Sudan  Council  of  Ministers 

The  president  of  South  Sudan  appointed  the  South  Sudan  Council  of 
Ministers  (SSCM)  in  consultation  with  the  vice  president  and  follow¬ 
ing  approval  of  a  simple  majority  of  all  members  of  the  South  Sudan 
Legislative  Assembly.  The  president  and  vice  president  were  members 
of  the  SSCM,  which  had  a  quota  requiring  that  least  25  percent  of  the 
members  should  be  women.  The  SSCM  was  the  highest  executive 
authority  in  South  Sudan,  and  its  decisions  prevailed  over  all  other 
executive  decisions.  SSCM  responsibilities  included  planning  and  gen¬ 
eral  administration;  approving  general  policies;  preparing  reports;  and 
negotiating  international  and  regional  agreements  on  matters  of  trade, 
investment,  and  foreign  aid  with  foreign  governments  and  nongovern¬ 
mental  organizations.  It  also  implemented  South  Sudan  legislation,  ini¬ 
tiated  bills  before  the  South  Sudan  Legislative  Assembly,  and 
mobilized  the  public  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  government  policy.  A 
further  responsibility  was  keeping  the  South  Sudan  Legislative  Assem¬ 
bly  informed  about  the  progress  of  the  CPA.

Government  and  Politics 


The  president  appointed  23  ministers  to  the  SSCM  in  2005;  the  num¬ 
ber  of  ministerial  positions  increased  to  32  after  the  April  2010  elec¬ 
tions.  According  to  the  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  ,  70  percent 
should  have  come  from  the  SPLM,  15  percent  from  the  NCP,  and  15 
percent  from  other  South  Sudan  political  forces.  The  SPLM  assigned 
only  two  unimportant  ministries  to  the  NCP  after  the  2010  elections. 
The  president  was  expected  to  select  ministers  with  due  regard  to  the 
need  for  inclusiveness  based  on  ethnic  and  regional  diversity  and  gen¬ 
der.  Each  minister  was  in  charge  of  his  or  her  ministry.  Ministers  could 
be  removed  by  the  president  in  consultation  with  the  vice  president,  or 
the  assembly  could  pass  a  vote  of  no  confidence  against  a  minister  by  a 
two-thirds  majority,  at  which  point  the  minister  would  have  to  resign  or 
be  removed  from  office. 

National  Legislature 

During  periods  of  military  rule,  Sudan’s  legislature  rarely  served  as 
an  institution  independent  of  the  executive.  When  it  seized  power  in 
1989,  the  RCC  dissolved  the  elected  legislature.  Al-Bashir  suspended 
the  National  Assembly  in  December  1999  following  a  dispute  with 
Speaker  al-Turabi;  it  did  not  resume  operation  until  February  2001. 

The  CPA  significantly  revised  Sudan’s  legislative  structure.  A  bicam¬ 
eral  National  Legislature  that  consisted  of  a  450-member  National  Assem¬ 
bly  (lower  house)  and  a  50-member  Council  of  States  (upper  house) 
replaced  the  former  unicameral  National  Assembly  that  existed  under  the 
1998  constitution.  President  al-Bashir,  in  consultation  with  First  Vice 
President  Salva  Kiir,  initially  appointed  the  450  (including  about  80 
women)  members  of  the  National  Assembly  according  to  a  70-30  North- 
South  ratio  using  the  fonnula  laid  out  in  the  Interim  National  Constitution. 
President  al-Bashir,  following  complex  consultations,  also  appointed  the 
two  representatives  from  each  of  Sudan’s  25  states  and  two  observers 
from  Abyei  Area  to  the  Council  of  States. 

In  April  2010,  nationwide  elections  determined  the  makeup  of  the 
National  Assembly.  The  NCP  won  189  and  the  SPLM  56  of  the  270 
geographic  seats.  Other  parties  or  independents  won  17  seats,  and 
eight  remained  undecided.  There  were  68  seats  on  the  list  chosen  from 
political  parties;  the  NCP  won  50,  the  SPLM  17,  and  the  Popular  Con¬ 
gress  Party  one.  There  were  112  seats  on  the  list  chosen  from  women; 
the  NCP  won  82,  the  SPLM  26,  and  other  parties  four.  The  NCP  easily 
controlled  the  National  Assembly  with  more  than  320  seats  compared 
to  99  for  the  SPLM  while  other  parties  controlled  the  remainder,  and 
four  were  postponed. 

The  Council  of  States  had  two  representatives  from  each  of  the  25 
states,  elected  by  the  state  legislatures  in  accordance  with  the  National 


239 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Elections  Act  and  regulations  set  forth  by  the  National  Elections  Com¬ 
mission.  Following  the  2010  elections,  the  Council  of  States  filled  46 
of  the  50  seats;  NCP  members  accounted  for  25  and  the  SPLM  for  21. 
Four  seats  in  Al-Gezira  and  South  Kordofan  remained  unfilled.  Abyei 
Area  had  two  observers  in  the  Council  of  States  elected  by  the  Abyei 
Area  Council.  Candidates  for  both  houses  had  to  be  at  least  2 1  years  of 
age  and  literate.  Both  houses  of  parliament  met  in  Omdurman  (so  close 
to  Khartoum  that  it  is  really  a  suburb  of  the  capital);  representatives 
were  elected  for  a  term  of  five  years. 

Functions  of  the  National  Legislature  included  amending  the  consti¬ 
tution,  approving  a  declaration  of  war,  impeaching  the  president  or  first 
vice  president,  and  authorizing  resources  and  revenues.  The  National 
Assembly  had  the  authority  to  approve  the  national  budget,  ratify  inter¬ 
national  treaties,  summon  national  ministers  to  present  reports,  and 
interrogate  national  ministers.  The  Council  of  States  could  initiate  leg¬ 
islation  of  interest  to  the  states,  approve  by  two-thirds  majority  appoint¬ 
ments  of  justices  to  the  constitutional  court,  and  issue  resolutions  and 
directives  to  guide  all  levels  of  government  concerning  certain  articles 
of  the  constitution.  Each  chamber  had  a  speaker  and  deputy  speaker. 

South  Sudan  Legislative  Assembly 

In  accordance  with  the  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan,  GOSS 
had  its  own  parliament.  The  Transitional  South  Sudan  Legislative 
Assembly  (TSSLA)  began  in  October  2005  with  1 70  members  appointed 
by  the  president  of  South  Sudan  after  broad  consultation  with  relevant 
political  forces  and  on  the  basis  of  the  following  percentages:  70  percent 
were  to  come  from  the  SPLM,  15  percent  from  the  NCP,  and  15  percent 
from  other  South  Sudan  political  forces.  Eight  political  parties  had  at  least 
one  representative  in  the  interim  assembly,  which  met  in  Juba  under  the 
leadership  of  a  speaker  and  deputy  speaker. 

South  Sudan  held  its  first  elections  for  membership  of  the  TSSLA  in 
April  2010.  There  were  102  geographic  constituencies,  25  seats  from  a 
political  party  list,  and  43  seats  from  a  women’s  list  for  a  total  of  170 
seats  in  the  TSSLA.  The  SPLM  won  161  seats,  independents  five  seats, 
the  SPLM-Democratic  Change  party,  an  offshoot  of  the  ruling  SPLM, 
three  seats,  and  the  NCP  one  seat. 

Members  were  elected  on  the  basis  of  universal  adult  suffrage  to  rep¬ 
resent  territorial  constituencies  for  a  term  of  five  years.  At  least  25  per¬ 
cent  of  the  members  had  to  be  women;  all  members  were  required  to  be 
at  least  21  years  of  age  and  literate.  Powers  of  the  assembly  include 
authority  to  amend  the  constitution,  enact  legislation  on  all  matters 
assigned  to  it  by  the  CPA,  authorize  resources  and  revenue,  impeach  the 
president  and  vice  president  of  the  Government  of  South  Sudan,  approve 


240 


Government  and  Politics 


annual  budgets,  interrogate  ministers,  and  ratify  bilateral  technical  coop¬ 
eration  agreements.  The  largest  party  or  coalition  of  parties  not  forming 
part  of  the  government  elected  the  leader  of  the  opposition  from  among 
members  of  the  assembly  The  leader  of  the  opposition  in  early  20 1 1  was 
from  the  SPLM-Democratic  Change  party. 

Civil  Service 

Northern  Sudan  historically  had  one  of  the  more  effective  civil  ser¬ 
vices  in  Africa  as  a  result  of  early  British  attention  to  development  of 
the  civil  service  and  the  premium  it  placed  on  educating  government 
employees,  tndependent  governments  carried  on  this  tradition,  although 
public  service  became  increasingly  politicized.  In  fact,  many  Sudanese 
held  civil-service  positions  or  equivalent  jobs  in  foreign  countries,  espe¬ 
cially  the  Arab  Gulf  states,  because  of  the  reputation  the  civil  service 
enjoyed.  The  1998  constitution  expressly  provided  for  a  civil  service 
that  was  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  country.  It  mandated  a 
system  based  on  merit  and  proportional  representation  from  all  areas  of 
the  country. 

The  United  Nations  Department  of  Economic  and  Social  Affairs 
helped  the  government  in  200 1  lay  the  groundwork  for  implementation 
of  the  National  Public  Service  Strategy  that  covered  the  early  twenty- 
first  century.  This  program  was  designed  to  change  individual  behavior 
and  the  work  environment  for  all  civil  servants,  establish  a  database 
and  information  system,  conduct  a  survey  of  public-service  training 
needs,  and  formulate  a  concrete  plan  for  the  first  phase  of  the  strategy. 
The  government  began  restructuring  the  civil  service  in  2002  and 
increased  the  salaries  of  civil  servants  in  2003  by  20  percent. 

Because  of  the  long-running  civil  war  and  the  lack  of  trained  South¬ 
ern  civil  servants,  it  was  understandably  difficult  for  the  SPLM  to 
establish  a  functioning  bureaucracy  in  the  South.  The  vast  majority  of 
senior  administrators  were  ex-army  officers  appointed  by  the  SPLM 
leadership.  Merit-based  recruitment  was  unknown,  and  administrative 
capacity  was  extremely  limited.  Until  several  years  ago,  the  SPLM  did 
not  pay  civil  administrators  but  authorized  them  to  collect  a  wide  vari¬ 
ety  of  taxes,  such  as  a  social  services  tax,  personal  income  tax,  customs 
and  excise  duties,  vehicle  registration,  road  tolls,  market  fees,  cattle 
auction  tax,  fishing  and  game  hunting  licenses,  etc.  The  nature  of  tax 
collection  varied  widely  among  states  and  counties.  There  were  no 
financial  management  or  control  systems,  little  or  no  budgeting,  and 
no  financial  audit  systems.  The  management  of  the  civil  administration 
was  highly  personalized,  hierarchical,  and  militaristic.  Many  South 
Sudanese  viewed  the  administration  primarily  as  an  opportunity  for  the 
enrichment  of  its  senior  officers.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  Interim  National  Constitution  created  a  national  civil  service 
that  theoretically  was  based  on  merit,  fair  competition  for  jobs,  affirma¬ 
tive  action,  and  additional  training  for  conflict-affected  people.  It  estab¬ 
lished  a  National  Civil  Service  Commission  (NCSC)  that  advised  the 
national  government  on  the  formulation  and  execution  of  policies 
related  to  public  service  employment.  The  NCSC  was  tasked  to  recruit 
Southerners  into  20  to  30  percent  of  the  national  civil  service  positions. 
Not  less  than  20  percent  of  the  middle-  and  upper-level  positions  in  the 
national  civil  service,  including  undersecretaries,  were  meant  to  be 
filled  by  qualified  Southerners  within  the  first  three  years  of  the  interim 
period,  25  percent  within  five  years,  and  30  percent  at  the  end  of  the  six 
years.  This  goal  was  overly  ambitious  in  view  of  the  relatively  few 
Southerners  trained  to  fill  such  positions  and  a  history  of  highly  ques¬ 
tionable  administration  in  the  South.  The  constitution  also  called  for  a 
National  Employees  Justice  Chamber  to  consider  and  determine  griev¬ 
ances  by  national  public-service  employees.  The  national  government 
passed  the  National  Civil  Service  Act  and  the  National  Civil  Service 
Commission  Act. 

The  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  established  a  broad  set  of 
values  and  guidelines  for  the  civil  service  that,  under  the  circum¬ 
stances,  constituted  wishful  thinking  rather  than  reality.  After  years  of 
civil  war,  South  Sudan  simply  did  not  have  sufficient  trained  person¬ 
nel  to  staff  the  civil  service,  although  the  government  was  paying  the 
salaries  of  100,000  civil  servants.  The  constitution  established  a  South 
Sudan  Civil  Service  Commission  (SSCSC)  to  advise  the  government 
on  the  formulation  and  execution  of  policies  related  to  public  service, 
employment,  and  employees.  Independent  and  impartial,  the  SSCSC 
had  the  power  to  investigate,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the  organization, 
administration,  and  personnel  practices  of  the  civil  service.  It  could 
propose  measures  to  improve  efficiency,  review  existing  practices  and 
guidelines,  address  imbalances  in  the  civil  service,  and  hear  employee 
grievances.  The  constitution  also  established  a  South  Sudan  Employ¬ 
ees  Justice  Chamber  to  consider  grievances  from  South  Sudan  civil- 
service  employees.  South  Sudan  set  up  some  19  independent  commis¬ 
sions  and  chambers,  including  the  Anticorruption  Commission,  to 
support  services  provided  to  South  Sudanese. 

State  and  Local  Government 

Relations  between  the  central  government  and  local  authorities  have 
been  a  persistent  problem  in  Sudan  (see  The  Federal  System,  this  eh.). 
The  1998  constitution  prescribed  25  states.  The  national  government 
subsequently  added  Lakes  State  in  the  South,  increasing  the  number  to 
26.  Following  the  2005  CPA,  South  Kordofan  State  absorbed  West  Kor- 


242 


Government  and  Politics 


dofan  State,  which  returned  the  number  to  25 — 15  states  in  the  North  and 
10  in  the  South  (see  fig.  1).  According  to  the  Interim  National  Constitu¬ 
tion,  each  state  had  its  own  legislative,  executive,  and  judicial  organs.  All 
of  these  positions  were  appointed  until  the  April  2010  elections. 

The  state-empowered  local  government  and  state  constitutions  deter¬ 
mined  the  organization  and  electoral  procedures  for  local  government. 
Each  state  was  headed  by  a  governor  and  a  state  council  of  ministers. 
The  governor,  together  with  the  state  council  of  ministers,  exercised  the 
executive  powers  of  the  state  in  compliance  with  the  schedule  of 
responsibilities  set  forth  in  the  Interim  National  Constitution.  Each  state 
had  its  own  capital  and  was  divided  into  several  localities  or  provinces, 
which,  in  turn,  were  subdivided  into  administrative  units. 

The  system  in  the  North  remained  centralized,  although  governors 
were  elected  in  2010,  and  they  appointed  their  own  ministers.  All  15 
Northern  governors  were  from  the  NCP  except  for  the  Blue  Nile  gover¬ 
nor,  who  was  a  member  of  the  SPLM.  Revenue  flowed  upward  to  the 
federal  treasury.  Some  levels  of  government  became  so  small,  how¬ 
ever,  that  they  did  not  have  a  solid  financial  base.  Oil-rich  and  highly 
contested  Abyei  Area  straddling  the  North-South  border  area  had  a 
special  administrative  status  under  the  presidency.  Residents  of  Abyei 
Area  were  citizens  of  both  South  Kordofan  State  in  the  North  and 
North  Bahr  al-Ghazal  State  in  the  South.  Eventually,  the  residents  were 
to  hold  a  referendum  to  determine  if  they  wished  to  retain  their  special 
administrative  status  with  the  North  or  join  the  South,  but  it  was  repeat¬ 
edly  postponed. 

The  South  Sudan  president  initially  appointed  all  state  governors  in 
consultation  with  the  vice  president.  All  governors  became  elected 
officials  in  2010;  they  were  all  from  the  SPLM  except  for  the  West 
Equatoria  governor,  who  was  an  independent.  Local  government  in 
South  Sudan  had  three  tiers:  county,  city,  municipal,  and  town  coun¬ 
cils;  the  payam  (district  encompassing  several  villages)  and  block 
councils  (coordinated  administrative  units);  and  the  boma  (one  village) 
in  the  rural  areas  and  a  local  neighborhood  council  in  the  urban  areas. 
The  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  specifically  incorporated  tra¬ 
ditional  authorities  and  customary  law  in  the  local  government  system. 
Local  governments  had  the  power  to  levy,  charge,  and  collect  fees  and 
taxes  in  accordance  with  the  law. 

There  were  significant  differences  between  the  organization  of  local 
government  in  the  North  and  South.  For  example,  Red  Sea  State  in  the 
North  had  four  localities  and  19  administrative  units.  Chiefs  or  traditional 
tribal  leaders  were  in  charge  of  the  localities.  South  Darfur  State  had  nine 
localities  and  was  further  divided  into  10  urban  and  33  rural  administra¬ 
tive  units.  Commissioners  were  in  charge  of  the  localities.  Because  of  a 


243 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


lack  of  infrastructure  and  skilled  personnel,  local  government  in  South 
Sudan  remained  a  work  in  progress.  Each  of  the  1 0  Southern  states  was 
divided  into  counties  that  ranged  in  number  between  seven  and  13.  Each 
state  and  county  had  a  capital.  For  example,  the  capital  of  West  Bahr  al- 
Ghazal  was  Wau,  and  the  state  had  seven  counties.  The  capital  of  Upper 
Nile  was  Malakal,  and  it  had  13  counties. 

The  Legal  System 

The  basis  for  law  in  Sudan  evolved  over  time.  The  legacy  of  British 
colonial  rule  had  a  significant  impact  even  after  independence.  Most  of 
the  lawyers  and  judges  were  British  trained  and  initially  tended  to  rely 
on  judicial  precedent.  Soon  after  independence,  however,  pressure 
began  to  build  to  change  the  legal  system.  By  the  time  al-Numayri 
seized  power  in  1969,  a  commission  had  been  working  on  recommenda¬ 
tions  for  a  new  system,  but  he  dissolved  it  and  formed  another  commis¬ 
sion  dominated  by  12  Egyptian  jurists.  Based  on  recommendations 
received  from  them,  Sudan  adopted  a  new  civil  code  that  looked  much 
like  the  Egyptian  civil  code  of  1949.  The  new  system  was  controversial 
because  it  disregarded  existing  laws  and  customs  and  introduced  many 
new  legal  terms  and  concepts  from  Egyptian  law  without  source  mate¬ 
rial  to  interpret  the  codes.  In  1973  the  government  repealed  these  codes 
and  returned  the  legal  system  to  its  pre-1970  common-law  status.  In 
1977  al-Numayri  agreed  to  consider  a  Muslim  Brotherhood  (see  Glos¬ 
sary)  demand  that  the  system  be  based  on  Islam.  He  appointed  al-Turabi 
as  chairman  of  a  committee  to  draft  new  Islamic  laws.  Al-Numayri 
accepted  few  of  the  proposals  from  this  committee.  He  then  established 
a  small,  new  group  in  1983  that  developed  a  “cut-and-paste”  version  of 
sharia  laws  based  on  practice  in  other  countries.  In  September  1983,  al- 
Numayri  issued  several  decrees,  known  as  the  September  Laws,  which 
made  sharia  the  law  of  the  land. 

Secular  Muslims  and  the  predominantly  non-Muslim  Southerners 
strongly  opposed  the  imposition  of  Islamic  law.  Even  before  issuance  of 
the  September  Laws,  however,  SPLM  leader  John  Garang  had  defected 
from  the  government  and  begun  to  organize  Southern  opposition  to  over¬ 
throw  al-Numayri.  The  enforcement  of  hudud  (see  Glossary)  punishment, 
which  included  flogging  and  amputation  of  hands  and  feet,  aroused  wide¬ 
spread  opposition  to  the  al-Numayri  government.  Following  al-Numayri ’s 
overthrow  in  1985,  the  Siwar  al-Dhahab  government  suspended  the 
harshest  hudud  penalties.  Both  Siwar  al-Dhahab  and  his  democratically 
elected  successor,  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  supported  sharia  but  criticized  its 
method  of  implementation  by  al-Numayri.  By  early  1989,  a  reluctant  al- 
Mahdi  expressed  willingness  to  consider  abrogation  of  the  controversial 
sharia  laws.  This  caused  his  coalition  partner,  al-Turabi  and  the  NIF,  to 


244 


Government  and  Politics 


resign  from  the  government  in  protest.  Al-Mahdi  announced  that  the  cabi¬ 
net  would  consider  draft  legislation  repealing  the  September  Laws  on  July 
1 ,  1 989,  and  would  meet  with  SPLM  leaders  to  resolve  peacefully  an  end 
to  the  civil  war.  The  military  coup  of  June  1 989  led  by  al-Bashir  occurred 
only  24  hours  before  the  al-Mahdi  government  was  scheduled  to  vote  on 
rescinding  the  September  Laws. 

The  al-Bashir  government  initially  retained  the  official  freeze  on 
implementation  of  the  sharia  laws  but  unofficially  advised  judges  to  apply 
them  in  preference  to  secular  codes.  Al-Bashir  asked  al-Turabi  to  prepare 
new  laws  based  on  Islamic  principles.  In  January  1991,  al-Bashir  decreed 
that  Islamic  law  would  be  applied  in  courts  throughout  the  North,  but  not 
in  the  South.  The  1998  constitution  specified  that  the  source  of  law  for 
Sudan  was  sharia  and  national  consent  through  voting  in  addition  to  the 
constitution  and  custom.  In  practice,  Sudan  treated  Islam  as  the  state  reli¬ 
gion  and  expected  it  to  inspire  the  country’s  laws,  institutions,  and  poli¬ 
cies  in  the  North.  The  Interim  National  Constitution  was  less  emphatic  on 
this  point  and  stated  explicitly  that  Sudan  was  a  “multireligious  country” 
where  diversity  meant  coexistence.  Nevertheless,  the  government  contin¬ 
ued  to  place  restrictions  on  non-Muslims,  non- Arab  Muslims,  and  Mus¬ 
lims  from  tribes  or  sects  not  affiliated  with  the  NCP. 

The  CPA  significantly  altered  the  judicial  structure  in  the  North  and 
created  a  new  legal  system  for  South  Sudan,  the  states,  and  the  national 
capital  of  Khartoum.  The  Interim  National  Constitution  established  an 
independent  national  judicial  authority  headed  by  a  chief  justice.  The 
chief  justice  served  as  the  president  of  the  National  Supreme  Court  and 
was  answerable  to  the  president  of  the  republic.  Structures  of  the  national 
judiciary  included  the  National  Supreme  Court,  national  courts  of  appeal, 
and  other  national  courts.  Nevertheless,  the  judiciary  remained  largely 
subservient  to  the  president  or  the  security  forces,  particularly  in  cases  of 
crimes  against  the  state.  The  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  created 
a  separate,  independent  judiciary  consisting  of  the  Supreme  Court  of 
South  Sudan,  courts  of  appeal,  high  courts,  county  courts,  and  other 
courts  or  tribunals  as  deemed  necessary.  Lack  of  qualified  personnel  pre¬ 
vented  full  staffing  of  the  judiciary  in  South  Sudan. 

The  Courts 

Since  1958  Sudan’s  various  military  governments  have  interfered 
with  the  judicial  process.  Following  the  military  takeover  in  1989,  for 
example,  the  RCC  issued  a  decree  that  gave  the  president  power  to 
appoint  and  dismiss  all  judges.  Al-Bashir  dismissed  many,  apparently 
because  they  were  insufficiently  committed  to  applying  sharia  in  their 
decisions,  and  replaced  them  with  supporters  of  the  NIF.  The  judiciary 
effectively  became  responsible  to  the  president  or  security  forces.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  National  Supreme  Court  was  the  highest  court  in  the  land.  It  was 
the  court  of  final  appeal  and  review  with  respect  to  any  criminal,  civil, 
or  administrative  matter  arising  out  of  national  laws  or  personal  matters. 
It  had  criminal  jurisdiction  over  the  justices  of  the  Constitutional  Court 
and  could  review  death  sentences  imposed  by  any  court.  The  president 
of  the  republic  appointed  the  chief  justice  and  members  of  the  National 
Supreme  Court  on  the  advice  of  the  Supreme  Judicial  Council.  The 
chief  justice  served  as  the  president  of  the  National  Supreme  Court  and 
presided  over  the  National  Judicial  Service  Commission  (NJSC),  which 
was  responsible  for  overall  management  of  the  national  judiciary.  The 
NJSC  regulated  relations  between  the  judiciaries  at  the  national,  South 
Sudan,  and  state  level.  In  the  case  of  South  Sudan,  the  NJSC  consulted 
with  the  president  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  South  Sudan.  The  National 
Supreme  Court  consisted  of  70  judges  operating  through  panels  consist¬ 
ing  of  three  judges.  It  reached  decisions  by  majority  opinion,  subject  to 
revision  only  if  and  when  the  chief  justice  concluded  that  a  judgment 
infringed  sharia  laws.  Four  circuits  of  the  National  Supreme  Court  oper¬ 
ated  outside  the  capital  in  the  Western,  Central,  and  Eastern  states. 

A  separate  Constitutional  Court  of  nine  justices  served  as  the  custo¬ 
dian  of  the  constitution.  The  court  had  jurisdiction  to  interpret  the  con¬ 
stitution  and  original  jurisdiction  to  decide  disputes  that  arose  under  the 
constitution  and  the  constitutions  of  Northern  states.  It  decided  on 
appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  South  Sudan,  the 
Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan,  and  the  constitutions  of  states  in 
the  South.  It  heard  cases  involving  human  rights  and  fundamental  free¬ 
doms  and  adjudicated  the  constitutionality  of  laws  or  provisions  in 
accordance  with  the  Interim  National  Constitution,  the  Interim  Consti¬ 
tution  of  South  Sudan,  and  relevant  state  constitutions.  The  Constitu¬ 
tional  Court  adjudicated  constitutional  disputes  between  levels  and 
organs  of  government  and  had  criminal  jurisdiction  over  the  president 
of  the  republic,  vice  presidents,  speakers  of  the  National  Legislature, 
and  the  justices  of  the  National  Supreme  Court  and  Supreme  Court  of 
South  Sudan.  The  president  of  the  republic  appointed  the  president  of 
the  Constitutional  Court  and  all  justices  upon  recommendation  of  the 
NJSC  and  subject  to  approval  of  a  two-thirds  majority  of  all  the  repre¬ 
sentatives  of  the  Council  of  States. 

According  to  the  Interim  National  Constitution,  the  number,  compe¬ 
tences,  and  procedures  of  the  national  courts  of  appeal  would  be  deter¬ 
mined  by  law.  In  2010-11  Sudan  had  some  130  judges  in  courts  of 
appeal  that  functioned  in  28  appeal  circuits  throughout  the  country,  each 
one  consisting  of  three  judges.  They  reached  decisions  by  majority  opin¬ 
ion  and  dealt  with  appeals  against  the  preliminary  and  appellate  deci¬ 
sions  of  the  public  courts  and  the  preliminary  judgments  of  first-level 


246 


Government  and  Politics 


courts  in  civil,  criminal,  and  personal  cases.  National  courts  of  appeal 
occasionally  overturned  decisions  of  lower  courts  in  political  cases, 
especially  from  the  public  courts,  which  consisted  of  a  single  judge.  The 
public  courts  had  appellate  jurisdiction  over  judgments  of  magistrates  of 
third  and  second  grade  in  criminal  cases. 

In  2005  there  were  133  public-court  judges  and  397  district  courts  of 
the  first  instance.  Civil  and  criminal  codes  passed  in  the  1980s  and 
1990s  prescribed  their  powers.  There  were  98  town  courts,  67  interme¬ 
diate  courts,  and  897  rural  courts.  Local  citizens  chose  the  members  of 
these  courts  from  among  prominent  residents  such  as  tribal  chiefs  and 
local  sheikhs.  Their  distinctive  feature  was  the  application  of  customary 
law  so  long  as  it  was  consistent  with  Sudan’s  laws  and  public  policy. 
These  courts  normally  resolved  problems  through  conciliation  and  dealt 
with  disputes  over  pasture,  water,  and  farmland.  They  tended  to  be 
located  in  remote  areas  where  there  were  no  district  courts.  Sudan  theo¬ 
retically  abolished  special  security  courts  in  2003  only  to  create  three 
special  courts  in  Darfur  under  the  state  of  emergency  to  try  crimes 
against  the  state.  For  example,  one  of  these  courts  consisted  of  a  three- 
judge  bench  composed  of  two  military  personnel  and  a  civilian  prosecu¬ 
tor  appointed  by  the  armed  forces.  It  followed  military  rather  than  civil¬ 
ian  procedures.  Military  trials,  which  sometimes  were  secret  and  brief, 
did  not  provide  procedural  safeguards.  These  courts  ceased  functioning 
in  2009.  The  Special  Courts  Act  (1989)  created  three-person  security 
courts  to  deal  with  violations  of  constitutional  decrees,  emergency  regu¬ 
lations,  and  some  sections  of  the  penal  code.  Special  courts,  composed 
primarily  of  civilian  judges,  handled  most  security-related  cases.  Sen¬ 
tences  usually  were  severe  and  implemented  immediately. 

In  2010-11  the  judiciary  in  South  Sudan  was  at  an  early  stage  of 
development.  South  Sudan  traditionally  drew  on  customary  law  and 
practice  together  with  common  and  statutory  law.  The  SPLM  recog¬ 
nized  traditional  courts,  known  as  courts  of  elders,  which  usually  heard 
personal  matters  dealing  with  questions  like  marriages  and  dowries. 
Local  chiefs  usually  presided  over  traditional  courts  where  defendants 
had  a  right  of  appeal  to  a  non-customary  court,  although  this  did  not 
always  happen  in  practice.  They  based  their  decisions  on  customary 
law.  GOSS  employed  courts  of  elders,  traditional  chiefs’  courts,  payam 
(district)  courts,  county  judges,  state  judges,  and  a  court  of  appeals. 

The  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  authorized  a  Supreme 
Court  of  South  Sudan  with  a  president,  deputy  president,  and  five  other 
justices.  It  was  the  court  of  final  judicial  instance  in  respect  of  any  liti¬ 
gation  or  prosecution  under  South  Sudan  or  state  law.  Its  competences 
were  similar  to  those  of  the  National  Supreme  Court  but  applied  only 
within  South  Sudan.  There  were  three  courts  of  appeal,  which  sat  in 


247 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Malakal,  Juba,  and  Rumbek.  High  courts,  the  highest  courts  at  the  level 
of  a  state  in  South  Sudan,  existed  in  all  10  states.  Decisions  of  the  high 
courts  could  be  appealed  before  the  courts  of  appeal.  In  addition,  South 
Sudan  had  established  county  courts  in  all  10  states  and  several  town 
and  rural  courts.  Traditional  courts  were  formalized  and  integrated  into 
the  judicial  system.  The  court  system  did  not  function  in  some  areas 
because  of  lack  of  infrastructure,  communications,  funding,  and  an 
ineffective  police  force. 

Sharia  Law 

Sharia  is  not  a  fixed  set  of  ideas.  There  are  substantially  different 
interpretations  of  sharia  in  Sudan  and  other  countries  concerning  what 
it  is  or  should  be.  During  Sudan’s  relatively  brief  independent  history, 
Islamic  authorities  approached  it  from  varying  points  of  view.  Long 
traditions  of  Sufism  (see  Glossary)  and  Mahdism  (see  Glossary)  influ¬ 
enced  these  debates.  In  more  recent  decades,  the  impetus  for  sharia 
tended  to  come  from  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  and  the  NIF  led  by  al- 
Turabi.  Other  key  political  figures,  including  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  and  for¬ 
mer  President  al-Numayri,  were  also  instrumental  at  various  points  in 
promoting  sharia. 

The  U.S.  Department  of  State  2009  International  Religious  Free¬ 
dom  Report  on  Sudan  estimated  the  country’s  Muslim  population  at  70 
percent.  Muslims  constituted  the  overwhelming  majority  in  the  North, 
although  there  were  sizable  Christian  communities  in  the  major  cities, 
especially  Khartoum.  Sudanese  who  believed  in  traditional  religions 
and  Christians  predominated  in  the  South.  The  1998  constitution  pro¬ 
vided  for  freedom  of  religion  but  treated  Islam  as  a  state  religion  and 
cited  sharia  as  one  of  the  sources  of  legislation.  Differences  over  the 
application  of  sharia  for  non-Muslims  were  one  of  the  root  causes  of 
the  civil  war  between  the  North  and  the  South.  As  a  result,  with  an  end 
to  the  conflict,  the  Interim  National  Constitution  underscored  the  diver¬ 
sity  of  religious  beliefs  in  Sudan. 

Sharia  remained  a  source  of  legislation  in  the  15  states  of  the  North. 
Sudan’s  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  in  accordance  with  sharia,  autho¬ 
rized  hudud  punishments  in  the  North,  although  the  severest  forms 
were  not  being  implemented  as  of  2011.  The  consumption  of  alcohol 
was  punishable  by  40  lashes  for  a  Muslim  and  20  lashes  for  a  Christian. 
Islamic  family  law  applied  to  Muslims  in  Sudan.  A  Muslim  woman  did 
have  the  right  to  hold  and  dispose  of  her  own  property  without  interfer¬ 
ence,  and  women  were  guaranteed  inheritance  from  their  parents;  but 
certain  Islamic  law  provisions  discriminated  against  women.  A  widow 
inherited  only  one-eighth  of  her  husband’s  estate;  of  the  remaining 
seven-eights,  two-thirds  went  to  the  sons  and  one-third  to  the  daugh- 


248 


Government  and  Politics 


ters.  It  was  much  easier  for  men  to  initiate  legal  divorce  proceedings 
than  tor  women.  Although  a  Muslim  man  might  marry  a  non-Muslim 
woman,  a  Muslim  woman  could  not  marry  a  non-Muslim  man  unless 
he  converted  to  Islam.  Women  were  instructed  to  dress  modestly 
according  to  Islamic  standards,  including  wearing  a  head  covering;  but 
there  was  minimal  enforcement  of  the  dress  code.  Converting  from 
Islam  to  another  religion  was  considered  apostasy  under  sharia  and  was 
punishable  by  death  in  the  North.  In  practice,  the  penalty  was  not  car¬ 
ried  out;  by  the  end  of  20 1 0,  the  last  case  of  apostasy  prosecuted  was  in 
1985  under  the  al-Numayri  government  and  involved  a  Muslim  who 
questioned  Islamic  beliefs  but  did  not  attempt  to  convert  to  another 
religion. 

The  national  government  did  condone  some  discriminatory  practices 
against  Christians  living  in  the  North.  The  government  required,  for 
example,  that  all  students  in  the  North  study  Islam  in  school  even  if  they 
were  not  Muslim.  In  the  twenty-first  century,  however,  there  was  a  gen¬ 
eral  improvement  in  religious  freedom  in  the  North.  The  Government  of 
South  Sudan  generally  respected  religious  freedom  in  the  10  states  in 
the  South. 

Human  Rights 

By  almost  all  accounts,  Sudan  has  had  a  poor  record  on  human  rights 
for  many  years.  Criticism  of  Sudan’s  legal  framework  for  failing  to  pro¬ 
tect  human  rights  and  concern  over  the  actual  situation  in  the  country 
increased  after  the  military  coup  in  1989.  Suppressed  civil-society  organi¬ 
zations,  opposition  political  parties,  and  trade  unions  were  quick  to  under¬ 
score  human-rights  abuses  after  the  coup.  The  government  disbanded  the 
independent  Sudan  Human  Rights  Organization  (SHRO)  in  1991  and 
replaced  it  with  a  government-controlled  body  under  the  same  name.  Its 
role  and  that  of  the  Sudan  Advisory  Council  on  Human  Rights  was  not  to 
monitor  rights  compliance  but  rather  to  consider  accusations  against  the 
government  and  advise  it  on  human-rights  issues.  In  the  meantime,  the 
independent  SHRO  relocated  to  Cairo,  where  it  remained  highly  critical 
of  the  human-rights  situation  in  Sudan.  The  national  government  enacted 
legislation  in  2009  to  create  an  independent  National  Human  Rights 
Commission;  it  only  appointed  the  commissioners  in  January  2011.  The 
South  Sudan  Human  Rights  Commission  was  established  under  article 
149  of  the  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan.  Its  primary  mandate  was 
to  monitor  the  bill  of  rights  enshrined  in  the  constitution.  Many  South 
Sudanese  charged,  however,  that  it  was  devoting  too  much  effort  to 
advancing  the  SPLM’s  agenda. 

Several  political  developments  had  an  important  impact  on  the 
degree  to  which  outsiders  focused  on  human-rights  abuses  in  Sudan.  A 


249 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


civil  war  between  the  North  and  the  South  that  resumed  in  1983  and 
officially  only  came  to  an  end  in  2005  led  to  numerous  abuses  by  gov¬ 
ernment  forces,  by  the  SPLA,  and  by  other  Southern  groups.  Sudan’s 
support  for  Iraq  in  the  1991  Gulf  War,  and  its  active  involvement  with 
international  terrorist  organizations  until  the  turn  of  the  century,  encour¬ 
aged  the  United  States  and  some  Western  countries  to  be  even  more  crit¬ 
ical  of  Sudan’s  human-rights  practices  than  might  otherwise  have  been 
the  case.  The  crisis  in  Darfur  that  began  in  2003  resulted  in  some  of  the 
most  horrific  human-rights  abuse.  The  United  States  and  most  human- 
rights  organizations  labeled  it  genocide.  Although  the  United  Nations 
investigation  of  Darfur  did  not  go  that  far,  it  was  highly  critical  and  said 
there  were  crimes  against  humanity  that  must  be  stopped. 

The  U.S.  Department  of  State  annual  reports  on  human-rights  prac¬ 
tices  in  Sudan  in  recent  years  acknowledged  improvements  in  some 
areas  but  noted  the  continuation  of  many  serious  problems.  There  had 
not  been  a  peaceful  change  of  government  since  1986.  Security  forces 
and  militias  were  responsible  for  extrajudicial  killings  and  disappear¬ 
ances.  They  regularly  beat,  harassed,  arbitrarily  arrested,  and  detained 
incommunicado  opponents  or  suspected  opponents  of  the  government. 
Sudan’s  security  forces  and  pro-government  militias  beat  refugees, 
raped  women  abducted  during  raids,  and  harassed  and  detained  persons. 
Prison  conditions  were  harsh  to  the  point  of  being  life  threatening,  and 
prolonged  detention  remained  a  problem.  The  authorities  did  not  ensure 
due  process  in  civilian  or  military  courts.  There  was  some  success  in 
curbing  serious  abuses  in  the  Nuba  Mountains,  however,  and  the  situa¬ 
tion  in  Darfur,  although  still  bad,  had  improved. 

While  Sudan  had  a  variety  of  daily  newspapers  that  reflected  different 
political  views,  restrictions  on  press  freedom  were  common  in  2010-1 1  (see 
Information  Media,  this  chapter).  The  government  controlled  news  report¬ 
ing  through  the  National  Press  Council  (NPC)  and  security  forces.  The  NPC 
licensed  newspapers,  set  press  policy,  and  responded  to  complaints  from  the 
government,  which  periodically  suspended  publications  and  closed  newspa¬ 
pers.  There  were  occasional  arrests  of  editors  and  journalists  who  criticized 
or  disagreed  with  government  policy.  The  government  directly  controlled 
radio  and  television  in  the  North.  It  also  restricted  freedom  of  speech,  assem¬ 
bly,  association,  religion,  and  movement,  and  arrested  and  harassed  those 
who  exercised  these  rights  contrary  to  government  wishes. 

As  part  of  tribal  custom,  female  genital  mutilation  was  widespread 
in  Sudan  (see  Women  and  the  Family,  ch.  2).  Compared  with  other 
Muslim  societies,  however,  women  were  relatively  well  represented  in 
public  life  and  accorded  special  attention  in  the  primary  health  care  sys¬ 
tem.  In  2007,  the  State  Department  included  Sudan  as  among  the  coun¬ 
tries  of  greatest  concern  in  the  trafficking  of  men,  women,  and  children 


250 


Government  and  Politics 


for  purposes  of  forced  labor  and  sexual  exploitation.  Many  of  these 
problems  resulted  from  the  effects  of  the  North-South  civil  war  and  the 
conflict  in  Darfur.  The  State  Department  described  Sudan’s  antitraffick- 
ing  law-enforcement  efforts  as  negligible. 

Antigovemment  insurgent  groups  and  associated  militia  forces  com¬ 
mitted  numerous,  serious  human-rights  abuses.  The  SPLM/A  violated 
citizens’  rights  in  South  Sudan;  there  were  occasional  reports  of  its 
responsibility  for  killings,  beatings,  rape,  arbitrary  detention,  and  forced 
military  conscription  of  underage  young  men.  The  Sudan  Liberation 
Army,  Justice  and  Equality  Movement,  and  other  rebel  groups  in  Dar¬ 
fur  also  violated  numerous  commonly  accepted  human  rights. 

One  of  the  most  emotional  charges  against  the  government  was  that 
it  engaged  in  slavery  (see  Umar  al-Bashir  and  the  Islamist  Revolution, 
ch.  1).  Much  has  been  written  on  this  topic — most  of  it  shedding  more 
heat  than  light — the  best  account  being  the  May  22,  2002,  report  of  the 
International  Eminent  Persons  Group,  Slavery,  Abduction,  and  Forced 
Servitude  in  Sudan.  The  report  concluded  that  most  of  the  allegations  of 
slavery  involved  economic  exploitation,  ranging  from  debt  bondage  to 
benign  relations  of  sponsorship  or  adoption  rather  than  slavery.  It  found 
evidence,  however,  of  exploitative  and  abusive  relationships  that,  in 
some  cases,  did  meet  the  definition  of  slavery  as  contained  in  interna¬ 
tional  conventions.  The  group  concluded  that  in  a  significant  number  of 
cases,  abduction  was  the  first  stage  in  a  pattern  of  abuse  that  fell  under 
the  definition  of  slavery  in  the  International  Slavery  Convention  of 
1926  and  the  Supplementary  Convention  of  1956.  Nevertheless,  the 
group  was  unable  to  establish  the  scale  of  abduction  and  enslavement. 
Allegations  of  slavery  encouraged  by  the  government  had  nearly  disap¬ 
peared  by  20 1 1 . 

Political  Groups 

The  traditional,  and  historically  most  important,  political  groups  in 
Sudan  were  the  Umma  Party,  Democratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP),  and 
much  smaller  Sudan  Communist  Party.  The  National  Islamic  Front  (NIF) 
led  by  al-Turabi  came  later  and  subsequently  changed  its  name;  many 
other  parties  have  come  and  gone  over  the  years. 

Following  the  military  coup  in  1989,  the  Revolutionary  Command 
Council  (RCC)  banned  all  political  parties  and  arrested  several  political 
leaders,  including  the  deposed  prime  minister  and  Umma  Party  leader, 
Sadiq  al-Mahdi.  The  NIF,  an  outgrowth  of  the  Sudanese  branch  of  the 
Muslim  Brotherhood,  was  the  one  political  group  that  strongly  influ¬ 
enced  the  al-Bashir  government.  The  NIF  changed  its  name  to  the 
National  Congress  Party  (NCP),  the  current  ruling  party,  in  1991.  (Com¬ 
mentators  often  refer  to  the  NCP  inaccurately  as  the  NIF.)  Al-Bashir 


251 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


eventually  forced  al-Turabi  out  of  the  NCP;  in  2000  al-Turabi  created 
the  Popular  National  Congress,  subsequently  renamed  the  Popular  Con¬ 
gress  Party  (PCP).  Within  a  year  of  the  NCP’s  founding,  however,  the 
two  most  important  Northern  opposition  parties,  Umma  and  DUP,  joined 
in  alliance  with  the  SPLM  and  a  dissident  Northern  group  known  as  the 
Sudanese  National  Alliance  (SNA)  and  formed  the  National  Democratic 
Alliance  (NDA).  Most  Northern  NDA  leaders  were  initially  in  exile  in 
Cairo.  In  1995  the  NDA  moved  its  headquarters  to  Asmara,  Eritrea, 
where  the  government  allowed  it  to  occupy  the  former  embassy  of 
Sudan  until  Eritrea  normalized  relations  with  Sudan. 

The  al-Bashir  government  continued  to  restrict  the  activities  of  oppo¬ 
sition  political  groups  but  did  permit  the  official  registration  of  political 
parties  beginning  on  January  6,  1999.  A  number  of  their  leaders  began 
to  return  from  exile.  Former  President  al-Numayri  returned  from  Egypt 
in  1999,  formed  the  Alliance  of  the  People’s  Working  Forces,  but  cap¬ 
tured  less  than  10  percent  of  the  vote  in  his  run  for  president  in  2000. 
Sadiq  al-Mahdi  returned  in  2000,  just  before  the  presidential  elections, 
but  chose  to  boycott  them.  DUP  leader  Al-Sayyid  Muhammad  Uthman 
al-Mirghani  remained  in  exile  in  Cairo,  although  some  of  his  Khatmi- 
yyah  (see  Glossary)  sect  leaders  became  politically  active  in  Sudan.  The 
Sudanese  National  Alliance  engaged  the  Sudan  government  in  talks  in 
Cairo  in  2004  and  subsequently  returned  to  Sudan.  The  SPLM  signed 
the  CPA  with  Khartoum  in  2005  and  became  part  of  the  national  gov¬ 
ernment.  Most  Southern  opposition  groups  joined  the  SPLM  and,  con¬ 
sequently,  are  also  part  of  the  national  government.  Some  Southern 
parties  remained  in  opposition  and  new  ones  formed.  Following  the 
Darfur  Peace  Agreement  in  2006,  one  faction  of  the  Sudan  Liberation 
Movement  joined  the  national  government  while  other  groups  refused, 
and  many  new  factions  subsequently  evolved. 

The  end  of  Sudan’s  civil  war  led  to  passage  by  the  national  govern¬ 
ment  of  the  Political  Parties  Act  of  2007,  which  regulated  the  registra¬ 
tion,  operations,  and  dissolution  of  political  parties.  The  National 
Constitutional  Review  Commission  held  consultations  on  this  act  with 
opposition  political  parties  and  civil  society  in  2007.  The  SNA  remained 
troubled  about  the  section  that  allowed  for  the  dissolution  of  political 
parties.  Other  opposition  parties  continued  to  voice  concerns  about  the 
commitment  of  both  Khartoum  and  the  SPLM  to  a  free  and  fair  environ¬ 
ment  for  elections.  The  handling  of  the  April  2010  national  elections  in 
both  the  North  and  South  justified  these  concerns.  The  following  discus¬ 
sion  of  political  parties  reflects  the  situation  at  the  start  of  201 1 .

National  Congress  Party 

The  National  Congress  Party  (NCP)  was  one  of  two  successor  parties 
to  the  NIF  and  effectively  served  as  Sudan’s  ruling  party  under  the  con¬ 
trol  of  al-Bashir.  The  NIF  dissolved  itself  after  the  1989  coup  and 
emerged  in  1991  as  the  NCP,  the  only  legal  political  party  at  the  time. 
Al-Turabi  was  highly  influential  in  the  NCP  until  May  2000,  when  al- 
Bashir  suspended  him  from  the  position  of  secretary-general  and 
removed  most  of  his  supporters  from  senior  posts  in  the  party.  Al-Bashir 
subsequently  banned  al-Turabi  and  his  Islamist  followers  from  partici¬ 
pating  in  any  political  activity.  Al-Bashir ’s  assistant  for  political  affairs, 
Professor  Ibrahim  Ahmad  Umar,  replaced  al-Turabi  as  NCP  secretary- 
general.  The  NCP  considers  consultation  between  the  leadership  and  its 
political  base  at  the  grassroots  level  as  its  main  political  principle  and 
Islam  as  the  source  of  Sudanese  culture.  The  NCP  preferred  to  have  a 
unified  Sudan  but  was  willing  to  go  forward  in  January  201 1  with  a  ref¬ 
erendum  on  Southern  secession. 

The  NCP’s  base  of  support  was  small,  and  the  party  suffered  from 
factionalism.  It  experienced  continuing  competition  for  political  control 
and  the  future  of  the  Islamist  agenda.  Disagreements  over  policy  in 
Darfur  exacerbated  the  situation  within  the  NCP.  Key  persons  in  the

party  included  Sudan’s  second  vice  president,  Ali  Uthman  Muhammad 
Taha,  and  assistant  to  the  president  and  former  minister  of  federal  rela¬ 
tions,  Nafie  Ali  Nafie.  Faced  with  internal  party  problems,  the  govern¬ 
ment  increasingly  relied  for  its  survival  on  a  policy  of  dividing  its 
domestic  opponents  and  using  offers  of  money  and  positions  in  the 
government.  This  practice  contributed  to  splits  in  the  Umma  Party, 
DUP,  and  SPLM.  Opposition  groups  collectively  had  more  popular 
support  than  the  NCP.  As  long  as  the  NCP  retained  significant  support 
in  the  security  services  and  successfully  implemented  its  divide-and- 
rule  tactics,  however,  it  was  well  positioned  to  retain  power  in  the 
North. 

Popular  Congress  Party 

The  Popular  Congress  Party  (PCP)  was  the  other  successor  to  the 
NIF.  The  power  struggle  between  al-Bashir  and  al-Turabi  resulted  in  al- 
Turabi’s  expulsion  from  the  NCP.  As  a  consequence,  al-Turabi  estab¬ 
lished  the  PCP  (initially  called  the  Popular  National  Congress)  in 
August  2000  in  opposition  to  the  NCP.  Al-Turabi  has  been  a  towering 
figure,  sometimes  operating  as  an  eminence  grise,  in  Sudanese  politics 
since  he  helped  found  the  Sudanese  Muslim  Brotherhood  in  1954.  The 
Islamist  movement  started  in  universities  and  high  schools  as  early  as 
the  1940s  under  the  influence  of  the  Egyptian  Muslim  Brotherhood.  The 
Islamic  Liberation  Movement,  a  precursor  of  the  Sudanese  Muslim 
Brotherhood,  began  in  1949.  Al-Turabi  then  took  control  of  it  under  the 
name  of  the  Sudanese  Muslim  Brotherhood.  In  1 964  he  became  secre¬ 
tary-general  of  the  Islamic  Charter  Front  (ICF),  an  activist  movement 
that  served  as  the  political  arm  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood,  and  was 
elected  to  parliament  in  the  mid-1960s.  He  headed  the  Front  of  the 
Islamic  Pact  and  the  Party  of  the  Islamic  Bloc  from  1964—69.  Following 
the  military  coup  in  1969,  al-Numayri  jailed  al-Turabi  for  seven  years. 
Released  in  1977,  he  became  attorney  general  in  1979  and  then  al- 
Numayri ’s  foreign  affairs  adviser  in  1983.  Al-Numayri  put  him  back  in 
prison  in  1985;  the  new  military  government  released  him  later  the  same 
year.  Al-Turabi  established  the  NIF  in  1985  as  a  replacement  for  the 
ICF.  Al-Turabi  held  several  ministerial  positions  in  the  democratically 
elected  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  government,  which  the  NIF  joined  in  1988  as  a 
coalition  partner,  but  he  was  never  comfortable  with  this  arrangement. 
Following  the  military  coup  in  1989,  the  RCC  briefly  arrested  al-Turabi 
even  though  it  was  widely  believed  the  NIF  actively  collaborated  with 
the  RCC.  Al-Turabi  and  his  NIF  supporters  soon  provided  essential  sup¬ 
port  to  the  military  government  as  part  of  the  new  NCP,  which  replaced 
the  NIF.  Al-Turabi  played  a  major  role  in  the  government,  including  his 
election  as  speaker  of  the  National  Assembly  in  1996,  until  his  falling

out  with  al-Bashir  in  1 999,  when  al-Turabi  again  began  to  spend  time  in 
jail  or  under  house  arrest. 

After  al-Turabi  created  the  PCP,  al-Bashir ’s  security  forces  regularly 
harassed  its  meetings  and  arrested  participants.  In  February  2001,  the 
PCP  signed  a  “memorandum  of  understanding”  in  Geneva  with  the 
SPLM.  Among  other  things,  the  memorandum  noted  that  self-determi¬ 
nation  is  a  legitimate  right  of  the  people  of  South  Sudan.  Al-Turabi  saw 
the  memorandum  as  a  way  to  undermine  al-Bashir  and  improve  his  own 
position;  it  resulted  in  al-Turabi’s  arrest.  After  three  months  in  prison, 
the  government  released  al-Turabi  from  prison  and  put  him  under  house 
arrest.  PCP  activity  virtually  came  to  a  halt;  al-Bashir  dropped  charges 
against  PCP  supporters  near  the  end  of  2001.  Released  from  detention, 
al-Turabi  was  rearrested  in  March  2003  on  charges  of  masterminding  a 
coup  attempt.  The  government  dismissed  these  charges  against  al- 
Turabi  and  the  PCP  in  December  2004  but  continued  to  keep  him  in 
detention  and  banned  party  activity.  Al-Turabi  managed,  however,  to 
have  a  significant  impact  on  political  developments  in  Sudan  from  jail 
or  house  arrest  and  eventually  was  released.  There  is  strong  evidence 
that  the  PCP  established  an  alliance  with  the  rebel  Justice  and  Equality 
Movement  in  Darfur  in  order  to  put  additional  pressure  on  the  govern¬ 
ment.  In  the  flawed  April  20 1 0  elections,  the  PCP  candidate  for  presi¬ 
dent,  Abdullah  Deng  Nhial,  a  Muslim  from  the  Dinka  tribe,  received 
only  4  percent  of  the  vote. 

Al-Turabi  by  2011  had  been  the  leader  of  Islamists  in  Sudan  for  the 
last  half  century.  Consequently,  his  philosophy  deserves  special  attention. 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


He  drew  selectively  from  Sudanese,  Islamic,  and  Western  political 
thought  to  fashion  an  ideology  for  the  pursuit  of  power.  Al-Turabi  sup¬ 
ported  sharia  and  the  concept  of  an  Islamic  state,  but  his  vision  was  not 
Wahhabi  (see  Glossary)  or  Salafi  (see  Glossary).  He  appreciated  that  the 
majority  of  Sudanese  followed  Sufi  Islam,  which  he  set  out  to  change 
with  new  ideas.  He  did  not  extend  legitimacy  to  Sufis,  Mahdists,  and  cler¬ 
ics,  whom  he  saw  as  incapable  of  addressing  the  challenges  of  modem 
life.  One  of  the  strengths  of  his  vision  was  to  consider  different  trends  in 
Islam.  Although  the  political  base  for  his  ideas  was  probably  relatively 
small,  he  had  an  important  influence  on  Sudanese  politics  and  religion. 

Young  Sudanese,  who  provided  much  of  his  following,  saw  his 
ideas  as  modem  and  not  a  return  to  the  past.  In  fact,  his  views  on  the 
role  of  women  in  society  were  relatively  progressive.  Al-Turabi  had 
his  greatest  success  in  recruiting  supporters  from  the  educated  and  pro¬ 
fessional  classes  in  urban  areas.  He  attached  fundamental  importance 
to  the  concept  of  shura  (consultation)  and  ibtila,  his  view  of  modernity, 
which  he  believed  should  lead  to  a  more  profound  worship  of  God. 
Religion  was  regularly  tested  by  the  reality  of  ibtila.  Al-Turabi  also 
saw  his  religious  theory  as  extending  beyond  Sudan.  He  created  in 
1991  the  Popular  Arab  and  Islamic  Conference  (PAIC)  with  himself  as 
secretary-general.  Its  goal  was  to  mobilize  progressive  Islamic  move¬ 
ments  against  the  West  and  to  promote  Islamic  revolution  within  reac¬ 
tionary  Muslim  states.  With  al-Turabi’s  fall  from  power  in  Sudan,  the 
PAIC  no  longer  functioned.  Al-Turabi  failed  to  achieve  his  goals  in 
Sudan  because  it  was  ethnically,  culturally,  and  religiously  diverse  and 
probably  not  subject  to  unification  by  any  form  of  Islamism.  His 
model  also  relied  heavily  on  authoritarian  measures. 

Umma 

Established  in  1945  with  the  goal  of  achieving  independence  from 
Britain  and  Egypt,  the  Umma  Party  obtained  most  of  its  support  from 
the  Ansar  (see  Glossary)  Sufi  order.  Its  supporters  followed  the  religious 
teachings  of  the  Mahdi  (see  Glossary),  who  ruled  Sudan  in  the  1880s 
(see  The  Mahdiyyah,  1885-98,  ch.  1).  Although  the  Ansar  were  found 
throughout  Sudan,  most  lived  in  rural  areas  of  western  Darfur  and  Kord- 
ofan.  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  a  direct  descendent  of  the  Mahdi,  became  head  of 
Umma  and  spiritual  leader  of  the  Ansar  in  1 970.  Constantly  in  conflict 
with  the  military  government,  he  was  imprisoned  by  al-Numayri  in 
1983  because  of  his  opposition  to  government  policies,  including  the 
September  Laws  that  institutionalized  sharia.  Umma  was,  however,  an 
Islamic  party  dedicated  to  achieving  its  own  political  agenda  for  Sudan. 
Sadiq  al-Mahdi  did  not  object  to  sharia  becoming  the  law  of  the  land  but 
rather  to  the  “un-Islamic”  method  al-Numayri  used  to  implement  it.

Government  and  Politics 


After  becoming  prime  minister  in  1986,  Sadiq  al-Mahdi,  working  with 
NIF  leader  al-Turabi,  began  drafting  new  Islamic  legal  codes.  Al-Bashir 
had  al-Mahdi  arrested  after  the  1989  military  coup.  Released  early  in 
1 99 1 ,  he  eventually  went  into  exile  and  actively  supported  the  Northern 
opposition  coalition,  the  National  Democratic  Alliance. 

The  government,  believing  that  it  had  successfully  split  the  political 
opposition,  invited  the  Umma  Party  leadership  back  to  Sudan.  Some 
Umma  leaders  returned  to  Khartoum  in  April  2000.  Sadiq  al-Mahdi 
went  back  late  in  the  year,  hoping  to  find  al-Bashir  more  willing  to 
permit  truly  democratic  elections.  On  his  return,  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  reaf¬ 
firmed  Umma’s  pledge  of  self-determination  for  South  Sudan  and  dis¬ 
avowed  an  Islamic  state  in  religiously  and  culturally  divided  Sudan. 
The  government  temporarily  banned  Umma  from  all  political  activity 
in  the  spring  of  2005,  claiming  it  had  not  been  properly  registered. 

Sadiq  al-Mahdi  experienced  severe  frustration  after  his  return  to 
Sudan.  Al-Bashir’s  offer  to  Umma  to  join  his  government  resulted  in  a 
split  in  the  party.  In  2002  a  group  led  by  Mubarak  al-Fadil  al-Mahdi, 
Sadiq  al-Mahdi ’s  nephew,  broke  from  the  party  and  created  the  Umma 
Reform  and  Renewal  Party  (URRP).  This  faction  joined  the  al-Bashir 
government  and  occupied  a  number  of  senior  positions.  The  URRP 
ended  the  two-year  alliance  with  the  government  in  late  2004,  charging 
that  al-Bashir  had  violated  their  original  agreement.  Most  of  the  URRP 
ministers  resigned,  and  al-Fadil  opened  discussions  with  Sadiq  al-Mahdi 
in  2007  on  rejoining  the  main  branch  of  the  Umma  Party.  This  effort 
failed,  and  the  al-Bashir  government  jailed  al-Fadil  for  four  months  in 
2007,  allegedly  for  participating  in  a  coup  plot. 

Upon  his  return  to  Khartoum,  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  called  for  an  all-party 
constitutional  conference  that  would  have  given  wider  legitimacy  to  the 
Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Development  (IGAD— see  Glossary) 
peace  process  and  brought  all  of  Sudan’s  political  forces  into  the  discus¬ 
sions.  For  this  reason,  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  opposed  the  CPA  because  delib¬ 
erations  leading  to  its  signing  effectively  eliminated  Umma  from  the 
political  process.  In  addition,  the  CPA  offered  little  opportunity  for 
Umma  to  participate  in  Sudanese  politics.  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  said  he  would 
join  the  al-Bashir  government  only  if  it  began  the  process  of  holding 
genuinely  democratic  elections.  He  also  pressed  for  a  government  based 
on  a  religiously  neutral  constitution  and  not  a  theocracy.  Sadiq  al-Mahdi 
argued  that  Umma  believed  there  could  be  no  Islamic  state  under  Islam, 
only  the  pursuit  of  Islamic  principles. 

Both  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  and  Mubarak  al-Fadil  announced  their  intention 
to  run  for  president  as  representatives  of  their  respective  wings  of  the 
party  in  the  April  2010  election.  At  the  last  minute,  al-Mahdi  withdrew 
his  candidacy,  although  the  names  of  both  Umma  leaders  appeared  on  the 
ballots.  Al-Mahdi  received  1  percent  of  the  vote  and  al-Fadil  0.5  percent.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Democratic  Unionist  Party 

The  Democratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP)  drew  its  support  from  the 
Khatmiyyah  (see  Glossary)  religious  order  and  for  a  long  time  com¬ 
peted  with  the  Ansar  order  and  Umma  Party.  The  former  National 
Unionist  Party  and  People’s  Defense  Party  combined  to  form  the  DUP 
in  1967.  Historically,  the  DUP  and  its  predecessors  were  plagued  by 
factionalism,  stemming  largely  from  the  differing  perspectives  of  secu¬ 
lar-minded  professionals  in  the  party  and  the  more  traditional  religious 
values  of  their  Khatmiyyah  supporters.  Muhammad  Uthman  al-Mir- 
ghani,  the  DUP  leader  and  hereditary  Khatmiyyah  spiritual  guide  since 
1968,  tried  to  keep  these  tensions  in  check  by  avoiding  firm  positions 
on  controversial  political  issues.  He  refrained  from  public  criticism  of 
al-Numayri’s  September  Laws  so  as  not  to  alienate  Khatmiyyah  fol¬ 
lowers  who  approved  of  sharia.  In  the  1986  parliamentary  elections, 
the  DUP  won  the  second  largest  number  of  seats  and  agreed  to  partici¬ 
pate  in  Sadiq  al-Mahdi’s  coalition  government.  By  1988  DUP  leaders 
had  persuaded  al-Mirghani  that  the  Islamic  law  issue  was  the  main 
obstacle  to  peaceful  resolution  of  the  North-South  civil  war.  This  con¬ 
viction  prompted  al-Mirghani  to  meet  with  SPLM  leader  John  Garang 
in  Ethiopia,  where  they  negotiated  a  cease-fire  agreement  based  on  a 
commitment  to  abolish  the  September  Laws.  Al-Mirghani  argued  that 
if  Khartoum  had  accepted  this  agreement,  it  would  have  resulted  in 
peace  in  Sudan. 

Following  the  1989  military  coup,  al-Mirghani  took  up  exile  in  Cairo. 
The  al-Bashir  government  then  had  some  success  in  exploiting  factional¬ 
ism  within  the  DUP  by  co-opting  several  of  its  leaders  while  al-Mirghani 
remained  in  Egypt.  One  of  those  leaders  was  Zayn  al-Abdin  al-Hindi, 
who  applied  to  reestablish  the  DUP  under  Sudan’s  1998  Political  Associ¬ 
ation  Act.  The  DUP  leadership  in  exile  rejected  his  initiative.  Al-Mir¬ 
ghani  joined  other  Northern  opposition  leaders  and  the  SPLM  in  a 
declaration  in  1995  that  led  to  the  creation  of  the  NDA,  which  then 
elected  al-Mirghani  as  its  head.  Al-Mirghani  subsequently  played  a  key 
role  in  encouraging  the  failed  joint  Libyan-Egyptian  peace  proposal  for 
ending  the  civil  war.  Al-Mirghani  finally  met  with  al-Bashir  in  September 
2000.  The  DUP  and  Khartoum  signed  a  bilateral  agreement  in  February 
2003,  although  the  DUP  sought  a  broader  agreement  between  the  NDA 
and  the  al-Bashir  government  on  a  complete  solution  to  the  “Sudanese 
problem.”  Al-Mirghani  continued  contact  with  senior  government  offi¬ 
cials,  speaking  for  both  the  DUP  and  NDA.  He  met  then-First  Vice  Pres¬ 
ident  Taha  in  Cairo  in  June  2004.  Relations  between  al-Mirghani  and  the 
government  remained  delicate  throughout  these  negotiations  until  the 
NDA  and  Khartoum  signed  an  agreement  in  June  2005. 


258 


Government  and  Politics 


Al-Mirghani  remained  in  Cairo,  but  the  DUP  resumed  engagement 
in  Sudanese  politics.  Its  goal  was  to  realign  old  and  new  opposition  par¬ 
ties  in  a  comprehensive  way  to  confront  broader  issues  such  as  national 
unity  and  the  transition  to  democracy.  It  continued  to  see  the  NDA  as  a 
mechanism  for  achieving  this  goal.  Hatim  al-Sir  ran  for  president  as  the 
DUP  candidate  in  April  2010;  he  received  2  percent  of  the  vote. 

National  Democratic  Alliance 

Established  in  1995  by  the  SNA,  DUP,  Umma,  and  SPLM,  the 
National  Democratic  Alliance  (NDA)  was  intended  to  lead  a  “popular 
struggle  against  the  new  dictatorship  in  Sudan  and  the  fundamentalist 
regime.”  The  government  of  Eritrea  turned  over  Sudan’s  vacant  embassy 
(Eritrea  broke  diplomatic  relations  with  Sudan  in  late  1991)  for  use  by 
the  NDA  as  its  headquarters  until  Asmara  reestablished  diplomatic  rela¬ 
tions  with  Khartoum  in  2000;  the  NDA  then  relocated  its  headquarters  to 
another  office  in  Asmara.  DUP  leader  al-Mirghani  was  the  chairman  of 
the  NDA  from  its  creation  through  early  2011.  Less  important  member 
organizations  included  the  Arab  Ba’ath  Socialist  Party,  Beja  Congress, 
Sudan  Communist  Party,  Federal  Democratic  Alliance,  Free  Lions, 
Sudan  Liberation  Movement,  Sudanese  National  Party,  and  Union  of 
Sudan  African  Parties  (USAP).  Umma  suspended  its  membership  in 
2000.  Once  it  became  part  of  the  national  government,  the  SPLM  also 
left  the  NDA. 

At  its  leadership  council  meeting  in  2003,  the  NDA  decided  to  pursue 
a  strategy  that  emphasized  peace  and  affirmed  its  willingness  to  meet 
directly  with  the  government.  On  behalf  of  the  NDA,  al-Mirghani  in 
December  2004  praised  al-Bashir’s  promise  to  end  the  state  of  emer¬ 
gency  following  the  signing  of  an  agreement  with  the  SPLM.  In  Febru¬ 
ary  2005,  the  NDA  executive  bureau  approved  the  Beja  Congress  and 
Free  Lions  as  the  official  representatives  of  Eastern  Sudan  and  the  Sudan 
Liberation  Movement  of  Western  Sudan.  It  emphasized  the  need  to 
establish  a  special  forum  to  discuss  issues  related  to  the  East  and  asserted 
that  agreements  reached  with  the  SPLM  and  the  Cairo  talks  with  the 
NDA  were  complementary  and  historic.  Khartoum  and  the  NDA  finally 
signed  an  agreement  in  Cairo  in  June  2005  that  set  the  stage  for  resolving 
their  differences.  The  parties  agreed  that  the  political  system  in  Sudan 
should  be  pluralist,  democratic,  and  peaceful,  with  a  democratic  transi¬ 
tion  of  power,  and  with  guaranteed  freedom  and  respect  for  human 
rights.  The  NDA  renounced  violence  and  its  members  subsequently 
returned  to  Sudan  as  part  of  the  political  opposition.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Sudanese  National  Alliance 

Formed  in  1994  as  a  democratic,  secular,  non-regional  party,  the 
Sudanese  National  Alliance  (SNA)  was  one  of  the  four  original  mem¬ 
bers  of  the  NDA,  the  coalition  of  Northern  groups  and  the  SPLM  in 
opposition  to  the  al-Bashir  government  in  Khartoum.  From  the  begin¬ 
ning,  former  general  Abdel  Aziz  Khalid  was  the  visible  leader  of  the 
SNA,  although  Amir  Babakr  was  the  SNA  chairman.  During  the  1990s, 
the  Sudan  Alliance  Forces,  the  armed  wing  of  the  SNA,  conducted  a 
number  of  low-level  military  attacks  against  Sudanese  forces  inside  the 
country.  The  Sudan  Alliance  Forces  merged  with  the  SPLA  in  2002. 
Subsequently,  the  SNA  joined  the  political  process  in  Khartoum.  Kha¬ 
lid  ran  as  the  SNA  candidate  for  president  in  the  April  2010  election 
and  received  0.34  percent  of  the  vote. 

Sudan  Communist  Party 

The  Sudan  Communist  Party  (SCP)  once  played  a  disproportionately 
important  role  in  Sudanese  politics.  Founded  in  1946,  it  was  known 
originally  as  the  Sudanese  Movement  for  National  Liberation.  It 
founded  the  Sudan  Workers’  Trade  Union  Federation  in  1950  and  had 
strong  early  ties  with  the  organizations  of  railway  workers  and  cotton 
growers.  It  changed  its  name  in  1956  to  the  Sudan  Communist  Party.  In 
1967  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  succeeded  in  having  the  SCP  outlawed 
as  an  atheist  organization.  Continuing  its  activities  underground,  the 
SCP  did  not  regain  its  legal  status  until  1985.  The  al-Bashir  government 
banned  the  SCP  in  1989;  it  eventually  joined  the  NDA.  Mohamed  Ibra¬ 
him  Nugud  was  the  secretary-general  of  the  SCP  from  1972  through 
2010.  Arrested  in  1989  and  then  held  under  house  arrest  until  1994,  he 
went  into  hiding  until  2006.  Nugud  reemerged  politically,  but  the  SCP 
suffered  from  a  dwindling  membership  after  1989.  It  still  retained  some 
support  among  workers,  farmers,  students,  women’s  groups,  and  minor¬ 
ities  in  the  Nuba  Mountains  and  in  Darfur.  It  remained  committed  to  a 
Marxist  orientation.  Nugud  commented  during  an  interview  in  2007 
that  Marx’s  analysis  of  capitalism  in  the  nineteenth  century  was  useful 
and  the  SCP  used  his  methods  as  a  tool.  The  SCP  advocated  socialism 
in  a  multiparty  system,  supported  the  right  of  the  South  to  self-determi¬ 
nation,  and  doubted  that  the  NCP  would  allow  free  and  fair  elections. 
During  his  campaign  for  president  in  2010,  Nugud  seemed  to  stress  the 
unity  of  Sudan,  called  for  a  “correction  of  economic  mistakes,”  and 
urged  a  multi-party  democracy.  He  won  only  0.25  percent  of  the  vote.

Government  and  Politics 


Other  Northern  Political  Groups 

The  April  2010  elections  generated  a  long  list  of  additional  North¬ 
ern  political  parties,  all  of  which  fared  poorly.  Most  of  them  will  never 
be  heard  from  again.  Two  of  the  parties  merit  mention,  although  their 
candidates  for  president  each  received  less  than  0.5  percent  of  the  vote. 

Munir  Sheikh  el-Din  Jallab  ran  as  the  candidate  for  the  New 
National  Democratic  Party  (NNDP).  He  called  for  the  unity  of  Sudan 
and  rejected  a  possible  secession  of  South  Sudan.  He  vowed  to  design  a 
solution  for  Darfur,  give  special  attention  to  the  concerns  of  youth, 
women,  and  children,  and  he  emphasized  the  role  of  the  free  market. 

The  Sudan  Socialist  Union  (SSU)  was  the  only  legal  political  party 
in  Sudan  from  1971  until  1985,  when  the  government  of  al-Numayri 
was  overthrown.  Professor  Fatima  Abdel-Mahmood,  who  served  as 
Sudan’s  first  female  minister  during  the  presidency  of  al-Numayri  and 
a  former  member  of  the  NCP,  headed  the  SSU  in  2010.  She  was  the 
first  woman  to  run  for  president  in  Sudan. 

Western  Political  Groups 

In  February  2003,  two  groups  developed  in  Western  Sudan  that  high¬ 
lighted  the  grievances  of  the  people  in  Darfur.  One  was  the  Sudan  Lib¬ 
eration  Movement/Army  (SLM/A),  which  began  agitating  for  greater 
political  and  economic  rights  for  Darfur  within  a  united  Sudan.  Minni 
Arkoi  Minnawi  was  the  secretary-general  of  the  SLM,  and  Abd  al- 
Wahid  Muhammad  Ahmad  al-Nor  was  head  of  the  army.  The  SLA 
evolved  from  the  Darfur  Liberation  Front,  a  secessionist  group,  and  it 
drew  support  from  the  Fur,  Masalit,  and  Zaghawa  peoples.  Its  vision  for 
Sudan  initially  was  close  to  that  of  the  SPLM/A,  and  it  had  links  with 
the  NDA.  Minnawi,  a  Zaghawa,  signed  the  Darfur  Peace  Agreement 
(DPA)  with  Khartoum  in  May  2006;  al-Nor,  a  Fur,  refused  to  sign.  Their 
difference  widened  a  preexisting  split  of  the  SLM/A  and  was  followed 
by  numerous  other  splits  in  the  organization.  Some  SLA  commanders 
who  refused  to  sign  the  DPA  joined  with  others  to  fonn  the  National 
Redemption  Front.  After  signing  the  DPA,  Minnawi  became  a  senior 
assistant  in  the  presidency  of  the  national  government  but  had  minimal 
support  in  DarLir.  Al-Nor,  who  claimed  to  lead  the  SLM  rebel  group, 
continued  to  call  for  unity  of  the  SLM  and  a  return  to  its  original  objec¬ 
tives.  In  spite  of  attempts  to  reunite  the  various  SLM  factions,  the  move¬ 
ment  remained  in  disarray  in  early  2011. 

The  Justice  and  Equality  Movement  (JEM),  the  second  important 
group  that  began  fighting  against  government  forces  in  Darfur  in  2003, 
drew  support  primarily  from  the  Zaghawa  people.  JEM  was  believed 
to  have  close  ties  with  al-Turabi’s  PCP  and  to  have  received  support 


261 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


from  Eritrea  and  Chad.  Its  initial  goal  was  regime  change  in  Khartoum. 
Its  chairman  was  Khalil  Ibrahim  Muhammad,  formerly  a  mid-ranking 
official  in  the  government  who  had  good  channels  of  communication 
with  the  Islamists.  The  JEM  team  was  the  most  professional  and  disci¬ 
plined  during  the  talks  in  Abuja,  Nigeria,  that  led  to  the  signing  of  the 
DPA.  JEM  also  faced  splits  and  defections  within  its  ranks.  In  2008 
JEM  carried  out  a  military  raid  that  reached  the  outskirts  of  Khartoum 
before  being  defeated. 

A  third  group,  the  National  Movement  for  Reform  and  Develop¬ 
ment  (NMRD),  split  from  JEM  in  March  2004  and  signed  a  cease-fire 
agreement  with  the  government  of  Sudan  in  December  2004.  It  had 
support  from  persons  living  along  a  stretch  of  the  Sudan-Chad  border. 
Although  its  force  was  small,  it  resumed  military  operations  against 
the  government  in  2005.  The  NMRD,  the  SLM,  and  JEM  were  among 
about  20  different  rebel  factions  in  Darfur.  Some  of  them  joined 
together  as  the  Liberation  and  Justice  Movement  and  were  engaged  in 
peace  talks  in  Doha  with  the  Sudan  government  in  late  2010. 

Eastern  Political  Groups 

One  of  the  oldest  political  parties  in  Sudan,  the  Beja  Congress  repre¬ 
sents  the  Beja  people,  who  inhabit  the  semidesert  area  along  eastern 
Sudan’s  Red  Sea  coast  and  the  hill  country  behind  it.  The  Beja  Congress 
held  its  first  provisional  meeting  in  1956  and  formally  established  itself  in 
1958  to  express  unhappiness  over  the  marginalization  of  its  region.  Khar¬ 
toum  banned  political  parties  the  same  year,  and  the  Beja  Congress  did 
not  reemerge  until  1964.  As  the  Beja  peoples  became  increasingly  mar¬ 
ginalized,  they  turned  to  military  tactics.  The  Beja  Congress  launched  an 
armed  struggle  in  the  1990s  with  the  support  of  several  hundred  fighters. 
It  controlled  a  section  of  territory  near  Karora  and  Hameshkoreb.  Its 
chairman  in  early  201 1  was  Umar  Muhammad  Tahir.  Amna  Dirar,  from 
the  Bani  Amer  branch  and  a  lecturer  at  the  Ahfad  University  for  Women 
in  Omdunnan,  headed  the  political  wing.  The  Beja  Congress  sought  self- 
determination  in  a  federal  system.  Although  it  became  an  original  mem¬ 
ber  of  the  NDA,  it  wanted  to  be  a  partner  at  the  negotiating  table  with 
Khartoum  rather  than  be  represented  by  the  NDA  or  SPLM.  It  estab¬ 
lished  links  with  the  SLM/A  in  Darfur. 

The  Free  Lions  represented  the  political  grievances  of  the  Arab 
Rashaida  nomads  in  eastern  Sudan.  Mabrouk  Mubarak  Salim,  a  gradu¬ 
ate  of  Damascus  University,  became  the  chairman  of  its  armed  wing,  the 
Free  Lions  Movement,  after  its  formation  in  1999.  The  group  had  sev¬ 
eral  hundred  fighters  at  its  peak.  The  Free  Lions  had  a  strong  relationship 
with  JEM  in  Darfur.  The  Beja  Congress  and  the  Free  Lions  joined 
together  as  the  Eastern  Front  (EF)  and  signed  a  peace  agreement  with  the 


262 


Government  and  Politics 


national  government  in  October  2006.  The  EF  then  served  as  the  major 
Eastern  opposition  movement. 

Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement 

The  SPLM  is  the  political  arm  and  the  SPLA  the  military  wing  of  the 
organization.  In  1983  the  Sudanese  army  sent  then-Lieutenant  Colonel 
John  Garang  de  Mabior  to  Bor  in  the  South  to  quell  a  rebellion  of  South¬ 
ern  soldiers  there.  Instead,  he  sided  with  the  mutineers.  Fighting  ensued 
between  Southern  and  Northern  troops;  Garang  went  to  neighboring 
Ethiopia  and  created  the  SPLM/A.  By  July  1983,  there  were  about  2,500 
SPLA  soldiers  in  Ethiopia  and  another  500  in  the  field  inside  Sudan.  The 
SPLM/A  received  strong  support  from,  and  was  influenced  by,  the  Marx¬ 
ist  regime  in  neighboring  Ethiopia  until  it  collapsed  in  1991.  Garang, 
who  received  a  B.A.  from  Grinnell  College  and  his  M.A.  and  Ph.D.  in 
agriculture  from  Iowa  State  University,  was  the  only  leader  the  SPLM/A 
had  until  his  death  in  July  2005. 

From  the  beginning,  the  organization  operated  in  a  hierarchical  fash¬ 
ion  with  a  tendency  toward  authoritarianism.  The  SPLA  was  first  and 
foremost  an  army  and  handled  itself  accordingly.  It  was  not  always 
clear  what  the  SPLA  was  fighting  for.  Nearly  all  of  the  military  com¬ 
manders  and  most  Southerners  favored  independence  for  South  Sudan. 
Garang  wanted  a  unified  Sudan  with  significant  autonomy  for  the 
South.  He  called  for  a  “New  Sudan”  that  would  be  democratic,  plural¬ 
istic,  and  united.  This  lack  of  consensus  within  the  organization  con¬ 
tributed  over  the  years  to  numerous  splits  and  instability.  For  a  long 
time,  there  was  also  concern  that  Garang ’s  Dinka  tribe  exercised  dis¬ 
proportionate  control  over  the  SPLM/A.  A  major  split  occurred  in 
1991,  when  Riek  Machar  created  another  SPLM  faction  consisting  pri¬ 
marily  of  supporters  from  the  Nuer  and  Shilluk  tribes.  At  one  point, 
Machar  even  joined  the  government  in  Khartoum  before  breaking  his 
ties  and  returning  to  the  bush.  Machar  resolved  his  differences  with 
Garang  in  2002  and  rejoined  the  SPLM/A.  In  early  201 1,  he  was  vice 
president  of  South  Sudan. 

In  spite  of  major  challenges,  the  SPLA  began  to  have  increasing  suc¬ 
cess  on  the  battlefield  during  the  1990s.  It  received  significant  support 
from  neighboring  Uganda,  Ethiopia,  and  Eritrea,  although  this  support 
dissipated  following  the  outbreak  of  war  in  1998  between  Ethiopia  and 
Eritrea,  when  both  countries  sought  better  relations  with  Khartoum. 
Garang  developed  good  relations  with  governments  as  diverse  as  the 
United  States  and  Libya.  By  the  late  1990s,  however,  Khartoum  began 
benefiting  from  its  oil  wealth,  which  permitted  larger  expenditures  for 
military  equipment.  After  almost  20  years  of  fighting  between  the  gov¬ 
ernment  and  the  SPLA,  it  became  apparent  to  both  sides  that  neither 


263 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


one  could  win  a  military  victory.  This  conclusion  and  the  growing  cost 
of  the  war  led  to  serious  peace  talks  under  the  aegis  of  IGAD,  which 
resulted  in  the  2002  Machakos  Protocol,  named  for  the  Kenyan  town  in 
which  it  was  negotiated.  In  January  2005,  the  SPLM  signed  the  CPA 
with  the  government  of  Sudan. 

Until  his  untimely  death  in  2005,  Garang  supported  a  unified  New 
Sudan  and  he  attached  much  importance  to  the  new  combined  army, 
which  he  saw  as  a  symbol  of  unity  and  sovereignty  during  the  six-year 
interim  government  called  for  by  the  CPA.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit, 
Garang’s  former  deputy  and  replacement,  publicly  supported  Garang’s 
vision  of  Sudanese  unity  and  a  New  Sudan  as  recently  as  mid-2009,  but 
it  became  clear  that  this  was  not  the  prevailing  view  among  the  SPLM 
rank  and  file.  Salva  Kiir  stated  publicly  that  unity  was  no  longer  an 
option.  The  SPLM  faced  major  challenges  in  the  South  because  of  lim¬ 
ited  infrastructure  and  lack  of  skilled  personnel  to  run  the  administra¬ 
tion.  The  issue  of  political  factionalism  also  returned  to  haunt  the 
SPLM.  Even  the  crisis  in  Darfur  led  to  different  positions  among  the 
SPLM  leadership.  The  SPLM  secretary-general,  Pag’ an  Amum,  stated 
in  mid-2007  that  genocide  was  taking  place  in  Darfur  while  Salva  Kiir 
avoided  using  the  tenn  genocide. 

In  June  2009,  Lam  Akol  Ajawin,  a  Shilluk  who  was  previously  the 
SPLM  representative  holding  the  position  of  minister  of  foreign  affairs 
in  the  Government  of  National  Unity,  created  a  new  party  known  as  the 
SPLM-Democratic  Change.  He  criticized  the  SPLM  for  not  implement¬ 
ing  John  Garang’s  vision  of  the  New  Sudan  and  condemned  his  former 
party  for  a  wide  range  of  failings.  Early  in  2010,  Lam  Akol  announced 
his  candidacy  for  president  of  South  Sudan  as  part  of  an  alliance  with 
seven  other  opposition  parties:  Sudan  African  National  Union  (SANU), 
United  Democratic  Salvation  Front  (UDSF),  United  Democratic  Party, 
Sudan  National  Labor  Party,  Union  of  Sudan  African  Parties  (USAP), 
South  Sudan  Democratic  Forum,  and  South  Sudan  Democratic  Front. 
During  the  presidential  campaign,  Lam  Akol  argued  that  secession  of 
the  South  in  the  present  circumstances  would  be  “suicide”  and  result  in 
“Somalization”  of  South  Sudan.  Lam  Akol  won  only  7  percent  of  the 
vote  in  South  Sudan;  he  immediately  cried  foul. 

Other  Southern  Groups 

South  Sudan  has  had  a  long  history  of  political  and  military  groups 
independent  from  and  even  opposed  to  the  SPLM.  Many  disappeared, 
and  some  joined  the  SPLM.  Even  those  that  still  existed  seemed  to  be 
constantly  in  flux.  The  government  in  Khartoum  had  a  long  history  of 
supporting  some  of  these  groups  for  its  own  political  purposes.  The 
SPLM  charged,  for  example,  that  the  Southern  States  Coordination 


264

Republic  of  the  Sudan, 
Press  and  Information  Section 


Council,  which  seemed  to  be  inactive,  was  simply  a  front  for  Khar¬ 
toum.  A  number  of  small  political  parties  had  organized  in  the  South  in 
support  of  the  CPA  but  were  opposed  to  the  SPLM.  Andrea  Ageny 
Ajak,  president  of  the  Sudan  National  Labor  Party,  opposed  secession 
of  the  South.  USAP  operated  under  the  NDA  umbrella  and  participated 
in  the  national  government.  USAP  chairman  Joseph  Ukel  Abango  said 
the  party  preferred  independence  for  the  South  and  that  it  never  sup¬ 
ported  John  Garang’s  concept  of  a  New  Sudan. 

The  most  significant  military  organization  outside  SPLA  control  in  the 
late  1990s  was  a  faction  of  the  South  Sudan  United  Democratic  Alliance 
(SSUDA)  and  dissident  elements  of  the  South  Sudan  Defense  Force 
(SSDF).  The  SSDF  was  the  military  wing  of  the  SSUDA.  Created  in 
1997,  the  organization  became  an  umbrella  group  that  once  brought 
together  a  variety  of  Southern  militias  and  political  groups,  all  of  which 
were  subject  to  regular  defections  and  factional  battles.  The  SSDF  relied 
on  logistical  support  from  the  Sudan  army.  The  SSDF  once  fielded  sev¬ 
eral  thousand  fighters,  especially  among  the  Nuer,  and  controlled  much 
of  Upper  Nile,  parts  of  North  and  West  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  and  much  of  East 
Equatoria.  In  addition  to  Nuer  support,  it  drew  from  the  Murle,  Shilluk, 
Fertit,  and  Equatorian  peoples.  Paulino  Matip,  a  Nuer  and  former  major 
general  in  the  Sudanese  army,  was  SSDF  chief  of  staff  from  2001  until  he 
joined  the  SPLM  upon  signing  the  Juba  Declaration  on  Unity  and  Inte¬ 
gration  on  January  8,  2006.  Matip  also  headed  the  Bentiu-based  South 
Sudan  Unity  Movement  (SSUM),  once  the  most  important  organization 
in  the  SSDF  coalition.  The  SSUM  and  another  SSDF-affiliated  rebel 


265 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


movement,  the  Rubkona-based  South  Sudan  Independence  Movement, 
joined  the  SPLM  as  a  result  of  the  Juba  Declaration. 

When  Matip  joined  the  SPLM  in  2006,  the  military  wing  of  the 
SSDF  lost  most  of  its  support.  It  became  more  active  on  the  Internet 
than  on  the  ground.  Its  main  grievance  was  that  it  had  been  excluded 
from  playing  a  role  in  the  Government  of  South  Sudan.  Gabriel  Tang- 
inya  became  the  new  leader  of  the  SSDF.  A  breakaway  faction  of  the 
SSDF  announced  late  in  2007  that  the  SSDF  had  disbanded  and  become 
a  political  party  called  the  South  Sudan  Democratic  Front,  which  was 
then  led  by  Bona  Malwal.  This  faction  promised  to  support  the  CPA. 
The  leader  of  the  United  Democratic  Salvation  Front  was  Joseph  Lagu, 
vice  president  of  Sudan  during  the  al-Numayri  government  in  the  mid- 
1980s. 

The  Equatoria  Defense  Force  (EDF),  which  operated  in  the  area 
around  Juba  and  Torit,  was  perhaps  the  most  politically  effective  group 
in  the  SSDF.  Most  of  its  fighters  were  Latuku  and  Lokoya.  It  was  gen¬ 
erally  believed  that  Khartoum  supported  the  EDF.  The  EDF  signed  a 
merger  agreement  with  the  SPLM/A  in  March  2004,  although  it  was 
not  clear  how  many  EDF  fighters  accepted  it.  The  Bor  Group  consisted 
primarily  of  SPLA  defectors  from  South  Bor.  The  governor  of  East 
Equatoria  charged  in  2006  that  remnants  of  the  EDF  continued  to  carry 
out  attacks  and  be  a  threat  to  security  because  they  received  arms  from 
Khartoum. 

Regional  Dynamics  and  Conflict 

Geographically,  Sudan  is  the  largest  country  in  Africa.  It  is  also 
located  on  an  ethnic  and  religious  fault  line.  The  Northern  population  is 
largely  Arab  and  Muslim.  The  people  living  in  South  Sudan  are  pre¬ 
dominantly  African  and  animist  or  Christian.  Arabic  is  the  principal 
language  in  the  North;  various  indigenous  languages,  and  English  for 
the  educated  elite,  prevail  in  the  South.  Consequently,  Sudan  has  expe¬ 
rienced  a  significant  amount  of  conflict  since  independence.  In  fact,  the 
only  period  of  peace  in  the  country  occurred  after  the  Addis  Ababa 
Agreement  of  1972,  which  ended  a  civil  war.  Peace  lasted  until  1983 
when  war  broke  out  again  between  Northerners  and  Southerners.  Other 
parts  of  Sudan  also  have  experienced  periodic  conflict:  Darfur  in  the 
West;  the  Nuba  Mountains,  Abyei  and  South  Blue  Nile  in  the  North- 
South  border  area;  and  occasional  flare-ups  in  the  East. 

Sudan  has  not  yet  found  the  answer  to  accommodating  these  diverse 
ethnic  groups,  languages,  cultures,  and  religions.  The  government  of 
Sudan  has  never  effectively  controlled  and  administered  the  periphery 
of  the  country.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by  a  weak  transportation 
infrastructure  that  fails  to  bind  the  country  together  (see  Transportation 


266 


Government  and  Politics 


and  Telecommunications,  ch.  3).  Had  it  been  possible  for  the  country  to 
remain  united,  meaningful  federalism  might  have  been  the  best  solu¬ 
tion.  The  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  tested  the  willingness  of 
the  North  and  South  to  make  a  success  of  federalism  in  a  unified  Sudan, 
but  as  the  referendum  of  January  2011  showed,  the  effort  failed,  prepar¬ 
ing  the  way  for  Southern  secession. 

South  Sudan 

The  colonial  experience  exacerbated  tension  between  Northerners 
and  Southerners,  the  latter  lagging  far  behind  in  education,  economic 
development,  and  involvement  in  the  government.  The  British  adminis¬ 
tered  the  South  as  a  separate  African  region  and  encouraged  the  devel¬ 
opment  of  Christianity.  As  independence  became  increasingly  likely, 
Britain  and  Egypt  competed  for  close  ties  with  Sudanese  in  the  North. 
They  saw  no  need  to  reach  a  genuine  accommodation  with  Southerners, 
arrange  a  separate  status  for  the  South,  or  even  insist  on  guarantees  for 
the  South  in  an  independence  agreement.  At  independence,  Britain  sim¬ 
ply  transferred  the  colonial  structure  to  Northern  Sudanese  nationalists. 
In  1955,  a  year  before  independence,  a  mutiny  of  Southern  soldiers 
attached  to  the  Equatoria  Corps  started  a  process  that  led  to  the  rise  of 
South  Sudanese  nationalism.  The  dissidents,  who  eventually  became 
known  as  Anya  Nya,  which  means  “snake  poison”  in  several  local  lan¬ 
guages,  conducted  a  guerrilla  campaign  that  forced  the  al-Numayri 
government  to  the  negotiating  table  in  1971.  The  result  was  the  Addis 
Ababa  Agreement  of  1972,  which  permitted  considerable  autonomy  for 
Southerners  and  promised  much  more  development  assistance.  Al- 
Numayri  soon  began  to  renege  on  several  key  provisions  in  the  agree¬ 
ment  and  effectively  abrogated  it  by  1983.  His  actions  led  to  the  cre¬ 
ation  of  the  SPLM/A  and  a  resumption  of  the  civil  war  that  only  came 
to  an  end  with  the  signing  of  the  CPA  by  Khartoum  and  the  SPLM  in 
January  2005. 

The  conflict  involving  South  Sudan  was  not  strictly  speaking  one 
between  the  North  and  South  or  even  between  Muslims  and  non-Mus¬ 
lims.  It  was  a  conflict  among  peoples  that  had  important  implications 
for  the  rest  of  the  country.  The  South  encompassed  an  extensive  diver¬ 
sity  of  people — at  least  200  different  ethnic  groups.  But  there  were  also 
different  views  by  Muslims  in  the  North  who  have  never  reached  a  con¬ 
sensus  on  the  future  of  Sudan.  The  situation  in  the  North  was  further 
complicated  by  the  fact  that  some  4  million  internally  displaced  South¬ 
erners  lived  in  the  Khartoum  region,  and  many  of  them  remained  there 
well  into  the  implementation  phase  of  the  CPA.  Some  of  the  Southern¬ 
ers  held  significant  positions  as  judges  or  served  in  the  police  force  and 
army.  It  was  this  very  diversity,  in  the  North  and  particularly  in  the 


267 


Sudan:  A  Countiy  Study 


South,  which  led  to  conflict  in  the  first  place  and  made  it  difficult  to 
fully  restore  peace  to  Sudan.  Divisions  persisted  in  the  South  just  as 
they  had  plagued  the  SPLM/A  since  1983.  The  loyalty  of  younger 
Southerners  to  the  SPLM/A,  and  the  agreement  it  reached  with  Khar¬ 
toum,  was  particularly  suspect.  The  conflict  was  a  combination  of  polit¬ 
ical,  cultural,  racial,  economic,  religious,  linguistic,  and  developmental 
differences.  A  surge  of  ethnic  violence  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  more 
than  2,500  people  and  forced  350,000  to  flee  their  homes  in  2009. 

Sudan’s  civil  war  had  important  implications  for  the  wider  region. 
Uganda,  Ethiopia,  Eritrea,  and  Libya  at  various  times  gave  strong  sup¬ 
port  to  the  SPLM/A,  whose  military  forces  often  took  refuge  in  Ethiopia 
and  Uganda.  Eritrea  offered  its  capital  as  the  headquarters  for  the  NDA, 
an  organization  in  which  the  SPLM/A  figured  prominently.  Egypt, 
Libya,  Eritrea  and  Ethiopia  preferred  a  unified  Sudan,  although  they 
were  prepared  to  deal  with  an  independent  South  Sudan.  Uganda  and 
Kenya,  although  they  had  not  commented  publicly  before  the  referen¬ 
dum,  probably  preferred  an  independent  South  Sudan.  In  the  1990s, 
Sudanese  government  forces  were  also  engaged  in  the  neighboring  Dem¬ 
ocratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  (formerly  Zaire).  Because  of  support  by 
neighboring  countries  for  the  SPLM/A,  Khartoum  periodically  assisted  a 
variety  of  foreign  opposition  groups  such  as  Eritrean  Islamic  Jihad, 
against  Eritrea;  an  extremist  Christian  group,  the  Lord’s  Resistance 
Army  (LRA),  against  Uganda;  and  the  Oromo  Liberation  Front  and  Ben- 
ishangul  Liberation  Front,  against  Ethiopia.  Khartoum’s  support  for  all 
of  these  groups  appeared  to  have  ended  by  early  2011.  Ethiopia,  Libya, 
Uganda,  and  Eritrea  normalized  ties  with  Khartoum.  The  end  to  the  con¬ 
flict  promised  a  major  peace  dividend  for  the  entire  region.  Up  to  early 
2011,  however,  the  Government  of  South  Sudan  had  squandered  much 
of  its  oil  revenue.  Little  of  it  had  been  devoted  to  development;  more 
went  into  corruption  and  building  military  capacity. 

The  score  card  for  implementing  the  CPA  was  decidedly  mixed  by 
January  2011.  The  cease-fire  was  holding,  and  Southerners  still  held  their 
positions  in  the  national  government,  although  they  demonstrated  more 
interest  in  the  future  of  South  Sudan  than  in  the  national  government.  The 
basic  constitutional  framework  envisaged  in  the  CPA  was  in  place.  Khar¬ 
toum  was  sharing  oil  revenue  with  the  South.  While  the  Abyei  Boundary 
Commission  had  decided  Abyei  should  be  part  of  South  Sudan,  Khar¬ 
toum  argued  that  the  commission  had  exceeded  its  authority,  and  the 
issue  remained  in  stalemate.  The  border  between  the  North  and  South 
had  not  been  agreed  upon,  but  some  80  percent  of  the  demarcation  had 
been  completed.  True  power  sharing  never  took  place  in  South  Kordofan 
as  mandated  by  the  CPA;  the  Nuba  Mountains  remained  an  oiphan,  with 
its  future  to  be  decided  through  consultations  in  the  state  legislature.  The 


268 


Government  and  Politics 


civil  service  never  became  the  joint  effort  that  had  been  envisaged  in  the 
CPA.  Perhaps  most  importantly,  neither  side  worked  hard  on  the  goal  of 
“making  unity  attractive.” 

Most  outside  observers  doubted  that  South  Sudan  could  successfully 
implement  independence.  When  asked  early  in  2010  if  South  Sudan 
were  sufficiently  prepared  to  go  it  alone,  former  U.S.  President  Jimmy 
Carter,  who  knew  the  situation  in  Sudan  well,  replied  “no.”  Some 
experts  believed  there  would  be  a  balkanization  of  South  Sudan.  Never¬ 
theless,  al-Bashir,  whose  NCP  still  preferred  unity,  was  on  the  record  as 
saying  that  Khartoum  would  be  the  first  to  recognize  an  independent 
South  Sudan. 

Western  Sudan 

Western  Sudan,  especially  Darfur,  is  located  far  from  Khartoum,  has  a 
shortage  of  water  and  arable  land,  and  is  subject  to  periodic  drought. 
Nearly  all  of  the  residents  of  Darfur,  which  is  the  size  of  France,  are  Mus¬ 
lim.  There  is  a  history  of  ethnic  tension  between  those  who  are  predomi¬ 
nantly  farmers  and  “African”  and  others  who  are  mainly  nomadic 
herdsmen  and  “Arab.”  It  would  be  inaccurate,  however,  to  attach  too 
much  importance  to  this  distinction.  Although  described  as  a  conflict 
between  Muslim  Africans  and  Muslim  Arabs,  experts  on  the  region 
insist  this  characterization  is  too  facile.  Local  issues  are  involved,  as  well 
as  severe  competition  over  scarce  resources  and  long-standing  marginal¬ 
ization  of  the  region  by  Khartoum. 

The  conflict  began  in  February  2003,  when  the  Sudan  Liberation 
Movement/ Army  (SLM/A)  and  the  Justice  and  Equality  Movement 
(JEM)  began  attacks  against  the  government  (see  The  War  in  Darfur, 
2003-11,  ch.  5).  The  attacks  may  have  been  precipitated  by  an  under¬ 
standing  that  the  SPLM/A  might  be  on  the  verge  of  achieving  success  in 
its  demands  following  a  long  military  struggle  against  the  North.  Taken 
by  surprise  and  lacking  adequate  military  force  in  Darfur,  the  govern¬ 
ment  mobilized  local  militias  known  as  the  janjaweed  (see  Glossary)  to 
oppose  the  SLM/A  and  JEM.  Joined  by  Sudanese  security  forces,  the 
situation  soon  spiraled  out  of  control  and  became  a  policy  of  ethnic 
cleansing  or  worse.  Some  Arabic-speaking  groups  participated  in  the 
attacks,  but  others  did  not.  The  attacks  by  the  janjaweed ,  supported  by 
government  helicopter  gunships  and  Antonov  bombers,  resulted  in  the 
eventual  internal  displacement  of  more  than  2.7  million  Fur,  Masalit, 
and  Zaghawa  and  another  250,000  refugees  in  neighboring  Chad  (see 
Ethnic  Groups,  ch.  2).  Between  200,000  and  400,000  people  died  as  a 
result  of  killing,  disease,  and  hunger.  Two-thirds  of  Darfur’s  population 
required  humanitarian  assistance.  The  United  States  asserted  in  2004 
that  genocide  had  occurred,  but  it  was  the  only  country  to  make  that 


269 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


assertion.  A  United  Nations  investigation  of  the  killings  acknowledged 
in  its  January  2005  report  “that  the  Government  of  the  Sudan  and  the 
Janjaweed  are  responsible  for  serious  violations  of  international  human 
rights  and  humanitarian  law  amounting  to  crimes  under  international 
law.”  It  did  not  use  the  term  genocide. 

The  conflict  in  Darfur  had  significant  regional  ramifications.  Darfur 
borders  Libya,  Chad,  and  the  Central  African  Republic.  Historically, 
Chadian  rebels  crossed  the  border  into  Darfur  in  order  to  mobilize  for 
attacks  against  the  Chadian  government.  The  same  ethnic  groups  live 
on  both  sides  of  the  border.  Chadian  president  Idris  Deby  was  one  of 
the  first  leaders  to  try,  unsuccessfully,  to  mediate  an  end  to  the  conflict. 
Libya  was  accused  over  the  years  of  trying  to  stir  up  trouble  in  Darfur, 
although  there  was  no  indication  it  had  done  so  in  the  current  conflict. 
The  African  Union  and  United  Nations  had  a  joint  peacekeeping  force, 
the  United  Nations-African  Union  Mission  in  Darfur  (UNAMID),  with 
about  22,000  personnel  in  Darfur.  There  was  a  significant  reduction  in 
violence,  but  both  refugees  and  internally  displaced  persons  were 
unwilling  to  return  to  their  homeland,  which  was  largely  destroyed. 
Darfur  settled  into  a  confused,  low-level  conflict  where  everyone  was 
against  everyone  else.  Khartoum  continued  to  charge  that  Hassan  al- 
Turabi’s  PCP  was  fueling  the  conflict  in  Darfur  by  supporting  one  of 
the  most  powerful  factions,  the  Justice  and  Equality  Movement. 

There  was  substantial  agreement  by  international  experts  on  Darfur 
that  only  a  negotiated  political  settlement  could  bring  the  conflict  to  an 
end.  The  highly  flawed  2006  Darfur  Peace  Agreement  remained  at  the 
heart  of  any  settlement,  but  the  peace  process  had  to  be  made  more 
inclusive.  There  also  needed  to  be  greater  emphasis  on  dialogue  among 
the  conflicting  parties  within  Darfur,  which  had  become  far  more  numer¬ 
ous.  A  number  of  them  began  negotiations  with  the  Sudanese  govern¬ 
ment  in  a  process  hosted  in  Doha.  Implicitly,  the  experts  acknowledged 
that  a  much  larger  peacekeeping  operation  alone  would  solve  nothing. 

Eastern  Sudan 

The  grievances  of  groups  in  the  East  are  similar  to  those  in  Darfur 
and  the  South.  The  Beja  Congress,  which  represented  many  of  the  2.2 
million  Beja  people,  and  the  Free  Lions,  which  spoke  for  the  Rashaida 
tribe,  were  marginalized  by  successive  Sudanese  governments.  They 
wanted  more  medical  services,  better  education,  increased  economic 
development,  and  more  influence  in  the  central  government.  They 
envied  the  success  of  Southerners  and  sympathized  with  the  concerns 
of  people  living  in  Darfur.  The  Beja  Congress  had  long  been  the  voice 
of  these  grievances.  It  aligned  with  the  NDA  in  1995  and  conducted 
military  operations  against  the  government.  The  Beja  and  the  Rashaida 


270 


Government  and  Politics 


never  sought  secession,  however;  they  only  wanted  to  be  part  of  a  fed¬ 
eral  system  and  have  access  to  an  equitable  share  of  the  country’s 
wealth  and  development. 

Following  the  killing  of  some  20  ethnic  Beja  at  Port  Sudan  early  in 
2005,  Sudan  announced  that  it  would  hold  direct  talks  with  the  Beja 
Congress.  Both  the  Free  Lions  and  the  Beja  Congress  had  close  ties 
with  Eritrea.  The  Free  Lions  also  had  links  with  Egypt,  Libya,  Kuwait, 
and  Saudi  Arabia.  In  fact,  Libya  offered  to  mediate  differences  between 
disaffected  Eastern  groups  and  Khartoum.  The  Beja  Congress  and  Free 
Lions  announced  in  February  2005  a  merger  into  one  military  move¬ 
ment  called  the  Eastern  Front.  As  Khartoum  faced  increasing  resistance 
in  Darfur,  the  pressures  of  implementing  the  CPA  with  South  Sudan, 
and  the  potential  for  new  conflict  in  the  East,  it  concluded  the  time  had 
come  to  reach  an  agreement  in  the  East.  Eritrea  played  a  crucial  and 
helpful  role  in  the  process. 

In  October  2006,  Khartoum  and  the  Eastern  Front  signed  the  Eastern 
Sudan  Peace  Agreement.  It  stagnated  largely  because  of  internal  power 
struggles  within  the  leadership  of  the  Eastern  Front.  A  split  among  Beja 
factions  of  the  Eastern  Front  prevented  it  from  presenting  a  list  of  nom¬ 
inees  for  the  posts  allocated  to  it  under  the  agreement.  The  Eastern 
Front  leadership  requested  mediation  by  Eritrea  to  help  resolve  the  con¬ 
flict  among  the  Beja  factions.  Nevertheless,  peace  continued  to  prevail 
in  the  region  and  Khartoum  remained  optimistic  about  the  implementa¬ 
tion  of  the  agreement  and  began  preparations  for  the  disarmament  and 
integration  of  former  Eastern  Front  combatants.  This  agreement  had 
more  to  do,  however,  with  normalizing  relations  between  Sudan  and 
Eritrea  than  it  did  in  resolving  the  concerns  of  the  Beja  and  Rashaida. 

Information  Media 

Sudan  had  one  of  the  most  restrictive  media  environments  in  Africa  in 
the  early  2000s.  The  Interim  National  Constitution  provided  an  unre¬ 
stricted  right  to  freedom  of  expression,  dissemination  of  information,  and 
access  to  the  press  without  prejudice  to  order,  safety,  or  public  morals  “as 
determined  by  the  law.”  It  added  that  the  state  guaranteed  freedom  of  the 
press  and  other  media  “as  shall  be  regulated  by  law  in  a  democratic  soci¬ 
ety.”  Finally,  the  constitution  stated  that  all  media  must  abide  by  profes¬ 
sional  ethics,  refrain  from  inciting  religious,  ethnic,  racial,  or  cultural 
hatred,  and  must  not  agitate  for  violence  or  war.  The  constitution  clearly 
left  most  of  the  implementation  of  press  freedom  to  the  passage  of  laws. 
The  Interim  Constitution  of  South  Sudan  had  similar  provisions  except 
that  it  omitted  the  necessity  of  refraining  from  inciting  religious,  ethnic, 
racial,  or  cultural  hatred  and  inciting  violence  or  war.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Sudan’s  print  media  since  independence  generally  have  served  one 
of  the  political  parties  or  the  government  in  power,  although  there 
occasionally  were  outspoken  independent  newspapers.  There  was 
more  press  freedom  under  civilian  governments  than  during  military 
regimes.  Radio  and  television  were  always  under  much  firmer  govern¬ 
ment  control,  irrespective  of  the  type  of  government. 

In  2003  al-Bashir  proclaimed  the  lifting  of  censorship  and  the  trans¬ 
fer  of  responsibility  for  monitoring  the  media  from  the  National  Secu¬ 
rity  Organization  to  the  2 1  -member  National  Press  Council  (NPC).  The 
president  of  the  republic  selected  seven  members  and  the  National 
Assembly  chose  five  members.  The  Journalists’  Union  elected  seven 
members  and  leaders  of  the  union  selected  the  final  two  members. 
Transfer  of  responsibility  for  monitoring  the  media  resulted  in  only 
marginal  improvement  because  state  security  officials  circumvented 
the  NPC  by  relying  on  the  government  prosecutor  in  charge  of  subver¬ 
sive  crimes.  Khartoum  continued  to  censor  print  and  broadcast  media, 
and  journalists  also  practiced  self-censorship.  There  were  occasional 
reports  of  harassment  of  journalists  in  South  Sudan.  Internet  service 
was  developing,  with  a  combination  of  government  and  private-sector 
involvement.  The  official  Sudan  News  Agency,  established  in  1971, 
distributed  information  in  Arabic,  English,  and  French.  The  Middle 
East  News  Agency  and  Xinhua  (New  China  News  Agency)  had  offices 
in  Khartoum. 

Print  Media 

Before  the  1989  coup,  Sudan  had  a  lively  press.  There  were  22  daily 
papers,  19  in  Arabic  and  three  in  English,  published  in  Khartoum. 
Including  those  in  Khartoum,  Sudan  had  a  total  of  55  daily  or  weekly 
newspapers  and  magazines.  The  Revolutionary  Command  Council 
banned  all  of  them  and  dismissed  more  than  1,000  journalists.  Slowly, 
the  al-Bashir  government  allowed  private  dailies  to  return  to  publica¬ 
tion,  although  they  were  all  subject  to  censorship.  Some  of  them  peri¬ 
odically  experienced  harassment,  including  the  jailing  of  journalists, 
seizure  of  newspapers,  and  suspension  of  publication.  After  the 
announced  end  of  censorship  on  all  Sudanese  newspapers  in  July  2003 
and  a  brief  improvement  in  press  freedom,  a  number  of  independent 
publications  again  experienced  intimidation,  interruption,  and  arrest  of 
their  editors.  Reporters  Without  Borders  stated  that  the  government 
ordered  seven  Arabic-language  newspapers  not  to  print  certain  articles 
“out  of  protection  for  journalists.”  The  government  used  as  a  pretext 
for  this  order  the  September  2006  murder  of  Mohamed  Taha,  the  editor 
of  the  privately  owned  daily  al-Wifaq.  An  Islamist  extremist  group 
claimed  responsibility  for  the  murder. 


272 


Government  and  Politics 


Estimated  total  newspaper  circulation  in  2005  was  23  papers  for  each 
1,000  persons.  In  2007  the  leading  English-language  daily  was  the  Khar¬ 
toum  Monitor ,  with  a  distribution  of  3,000  to  3,500  copies  per  day.  It 
experienced  periodic  harassment.  This  independent  paper  tended  to 
reflect  the  views  of  Southerners.  Sudan  Vision  was  a  progovemment 
paper  with  a  daily  circulation  of  about  3,200  copies.  The  Citizen  sup¬ 
ported  the  views  of  the  SPLM  and  distributed  about  2,000  copies  per 
day.  The  Sudan  Tribune  was  an  Internet  paper  from  Paris  that  tended  to 
be  critical  of  the  NPC.  In  2008  the  NPC  suspended  the  publishing 
license  of  both  the  Citizen  and  Sudan  Tribune.  In  2003  publication  began 
in  Kampala,  Uganda,  of  the  Sudan  Mirror ,  which  focused  on  South 
Sudan  and  relied  on  reporters  in  Southern  towns.  The  print  media  were 
at  a  very  early  stage  of  development  in  South  Sudan.  The  English-lan¬ 
guage  weekly,  Juba  Post ,  remained  the  most  widely  circulated  Southern 
paper  with  about  1,500  copies  per  week  in  Juba  and  another  500  in 
Khartoum. 

The  Arabic-language  press  was  much  more  important  than  the  Eng¬ 
lish-language  media.  Authorities  briefly  suspended  publication  of  a 
leading  Arabic-language  paper,  Al-Sahafa,  in  2003  for  carrying  an  Ethi¬ 
opian  Airlines  advertisement  that  mentioned  the  drinking  of  alcohol. 
Often  critical  of  the  government,  Al-Sahafa  distributed  25,000  to  27,000 
copies  daily.  The  government  shut  down  the  independent  A  l- Ay  am  in 
2004,  primarily  for  its  reporting  on  the  crisis  in  Darfur.  Al-Ayam  had  a 
daily  circulation  of  1 8,000  to  20,000  copies  per  day.  The  Sudanese  min¬ 
ister  of  justice  ordered  prosecutors  in  March  2004  to  end  indefinite  clo¬ 
sure  of  newspapers  without  trial.  Nevertheless,  Al-Sahafa ,  Al-Ayam,  and 
other  papers  reported  instances  of  harassment  by  security  forces  in 
2006.  The  largest  Arabic-language  daily  was  Akhbar  Al-Youn.  It  had 
strong  links  to  the  government  and  distributed  30,000  to  35,000  copies 
per  day.  Al-Rai  Al-Aam ,  with  a  daily  circulation  of  about  18,000,  was  an 
Islamist  paper  with  strong  links  to  the  government  but  had  columnists 
who  were  antigovemment.  Alwan  had  a  daily  circulation  of  about 
16,000  and  generally  supported  al-Turabi’s  PCP.  The  government 
funded  Al-Hayat ,  which  had  close  ties  to  Vice  President  Taha.  Other 
Arabic-language  dailies  included  Al-Wifaq  (pro-government  and  anti- 
West),  Al-Khartoum  (linked  to  the  DUP),  Al-Sharia  Al-Siyasi  (pro-gov¬ 
ernment),  Al-Watan  (independent),  Al-Sudani  (independent  with  a  large 
readership  in  the  diaspora),  Al-Intibaha  (anti-SPLM  but  supported 
secession  of  the  South),  Rai  Al-Shaab  (mouthpiece  of  al-Turabi’s  PCP), 
and  Akhir  Lahza  (usually  pro-go vemment).  In  2010  security  personnel 
shut  down  the  offices  of  Rai  Al-Shaab.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Radio,  Television,  and  Internet 

The  government  directly  controlled  radio  broadcasting  in  the  early 
2000s.  In  a  country  as  large  as  Sudan,  radio  was  especially  important 
in  disseminating  information.  The  Sudan  National  Radio  Corporation, 
which  dated  back  to  1940,  broadcast  a  mixture  of  news,  music,  and 
cultural  programs  through  national  and  regional  networks  in  Arabic, 
English,  French,  and  Swahili.  There  was  only  one  private  radio  station 
in  Northern  Sudan;  it  was  an  FM  station  that  broadcast  music  in  Khar¬ 
toum.  Several  opposition  and  clandestine  radio  networks  operated  until 
the  early  2000s,  although  there  were  occasional  reports  of  clandestine 
broadcasts  from  Darfur.  The  Voice  of  Sudan,  operated  by  the  opposi¬ 
tion  NDA,  broadcast  shortwave  intermittently  from  neighboring  Eri¬ 
trea  beginning  in  1995  until  the  parties  that  made  up  the  NDA  returned 
to  Sudan.  The  New  Sudan  Council  of  Churches  had  a  weekly  broad¬ 
cast  called  the  Voice  of  Hope  produced  in  studios  in  Uganda  and  the 
Netherlands  and  transmitted  via  the  Radio  Netherlands  relay  station  in 
Madagascar.  In  2010,  Sudan  suspended  the  BBC’s  license  to  broadcast 
in  Arabic  on  local  FM  frequencies  in  four  Northern  cities,  including 
Khartoum. 

The  SPLM/A,  when  it  was  fighting  the  government,  periodically 
broadcast  from  clandestine  transmitters  in  the  region.  Juba  in  early 
2011  had  several  transmitting  stations:  BBC  World,  Capital  FM,  and 
Bakhita  Radio.  The  state  government  in  Central  Equatoria  where  Juba, 
the  capital,  is  located  shut  down  the  radio  station  Liberty  FM,  after  a 
caller  made  a  remark  critical  of  the  government  during  a  call-in  show. 
The  Sudan  Radio  Service,  developed  by  the  Education  Development 
Center,  a  U.S.  nongovernmental  organization  financially  supported  by 
the  U.S.  Agency  for  International  Development,  began  broadcasting 
from  Nairobi,  Kenya,  in  July  2003.  Sudanese  producers  broadcast  pro¬ 
grams  in  10  Sudanese  languages,  focusing  on  civic  education,  health, 
agriculture,  and  education,  as  well  as  on  music  and  entertainment,  with 
the  overall  purpose  of  informing  Sudanese  about  peacemaking,  recon¬ 
ciliation,  and  economic  development.  The  UN  Mission  in  Sudan 
(UNMIS)  operated  Radio  Miraya  FM  out  of  Juba  in  an  effort  to  trans¬ 
mit  reliable  and  accessible  information  about  the  peace  process  to  a 
wider  audience.  UNMIS  opened  a  repeater  station  in  Rumbek  early  in 
2007  and  began  work  on  four  additional  stations  so  that  Radio  Miraya 
could  broadcast  to  remote  areas  of  West  Equatoria  and  East  Equatoria 
States.  In  addition  to  news  and  CPA-related  programming,  Radio 
Miraya  had  some  primary  educational  programs.  In  2010  the  minister 
of  information  and  broadcasting  accused  Radio  Miraya  of  inciting  eth¬ 
nic  violence  in  South  Sudan.

Government  and  Politics 


Sudan  officially  began  television  transmission  in  1963.  In  the  early 
years,  it  only  reached  a  short  distance  from  Khartoum.  The  Sudan 
National  Broadcasting  Corporation  in  2011  operated  two  television 
channels;  both  reflected  government  policies.  Sudan  had  a  military 
censor  to  ensure  that  the  news  did  not  contradict  official  views.  Satel¬ 
lite  dishes  were  common  in  affluent  areas  and  pan- Arab  television  sta¬ 
tions  were  popular.  In  addition  to  domestic  and  satellite  TV  services, 
there  was  a  subscription  cable  network,  which  directly  rebroadcast 
uncensored  foreign  news  and  other  programs.  The  government  shut 
down  the  Al-Jazeera  bureau  late  in  2003  and  arrested  the  bureau  chief 
for  alleged  false  programming  and  poor  analysis  of  atrocities  in  Darfur. 
The  bureau  chief  went  to  prison,  but  Al-Jazeera  subsequently  reopened 
the  office. 

As  of  2010-11,  the  government  monitored  Internet  communications 
and  the  National  Intelligence  and  Security  Service  read  e-mail  between 
private  citizens.  Some  Web  sites  deemed  offensive  to  public  morality 
were  blocked  by  the  National  Telecommunications  Corporation,  as 
were  many  proxy  servers.  There  generally  were  no  restrictions  on 
access  to  news  and  information  Web  sites,  although  authorities  regu¬ 
larly  blocked  access  to  youtube.com.  Internet  access  was  widely  avail¬ 
able  in  urban  areas,  but  limited  by  lack  of  infrastructure  in  rural  areas. 

Foreign  Relations 

Sudan  has  had  a  testy  relationship  with  many  Western  countries, 
especially  the  United  States,  since  the  1989  coup  put  in  power  a  govern¬ 
ment  significantly  influenced  by  Islamist  militancy.  More  recent  coop¬ 
eration  with  the  United  States  and  other  countries  on  countering 
terrorism  temporarily  improved  ties,  but  they  were  subsequently  set 
back  by  continuing  violence  in  Darfur.  The  degree  to  which  Sudan 
pushed  an  Islamist  agenda  beyond  its  borders  and  supported  opposition 
groups  in  nearby  countries  tended  to  determine  the  quality  of  relations 
with  its  nine  neighbors.  When  Sudan  was  respectful  of  its  neighbors, 
relations  were  usually  friendly;  when  it  interfered  with  governments  in 
neighboring  states,  they  were  poor.  Sometimes,  Sudan’s  neighbors  pre¬ 
cipitated  the  hostility.  On  other  occasions,  developments  between 
neighboring  states  led  to  improved  relations  with  Sudan.  The  1 998— 
2000  war  between  Eritrea  and  Ethiopia  was  a  major  windfall  for  Sudan. 
It  resulted  in  better  Sudanese  relations  with  both  countries  as  they 
sought  to  neutralize  Sudan  as  an  enemy  in  order  to  focus  their  enmity  on 
each  other. 

The  decision  by  the  al-Bashir  government  in  1999  to  remove  al- 
Turabi,  the  Islamist  leader,  as  the  speaker  of  the  National  Assembly, 
and  subsequently  to  arrest  him,  signaled  a  change  in  Sudan’s  approach

to  its  relations  with  Western  countries.  The  September  11,  2001,  terror¬ 
ist  attacks  against  the  United  States  and  Washington’s  strong  reaction 
to  them  further  encouraged  Sudan  to  improve  relations  with  the  West. 
Growing  cooperation  on  counterterrorism  and  the  opening  of  serious 
discussions  in  2003  between  Sudan  and  the  SPLM/A  to  end  the  civil 
war  speeded  up  this  process.  But  the  international  goodwill  obtained 
early  in  2005  by  the  signing  of  the  CPA  with  the  SPLM  that  ended  con¬ 
flict  was  significantly  offset  by  Khartoum’s  handling  of  the  crisis  in 
Darfur.  Since  the  1989  coup,  Sudan  has  maintained  generally  cordial 
relations  with  other  Muslim  countries  and  with  China,  Russia,  India, 
and  Iran.  It  also  has  worked  hard  and  largely  successfully  to  retain  sup¬ 
port  within  the  United  Nations  and  African,  Arab,  and  Muslim  regional 
organizations. 

Sudan  considers  itself  as  part  of  both  the  Arab  and  African  worlds, 
although  its  foreign-policy  leadership  has  always  tended  to  look  north, 
particularly  to  Egypt,  and  to  some  extent  west  and  east,  rather  than 
south  into  tropical  Africa.  In  order  to  ensure  its  own  security,  it  accords 
special  attention  to  relations  with  its  nine  neighbors.  Although  it  has 
tried  to  develop  cordial  relations  with  all  of  these  countries,  it  has  spo¬ 
radically  supported  opposition  groups  trying  to  overthrow  govern¬ 
ments  in  neighboring  countries  if  it  perceived  those  governments  as  a 
threat  to  Sudan.  It  has  striven  with  considerable  success  to  have  a  sig¬ 
nificant  voice  in  regional  and  international  bodies  and  establishes  link¬ 
ages  with  any  state  that  would  help  deflect  criticism  of  its  internal  and 
external  policies.  The  neighbor  of  overriding  importance  to  Sudan  has 
always  been  Egypt.  Occasionally  described  as  a  love-hate  relationship, 
Sudan  cannot  ignore  Egypt.  A  significant  part  of  this  tie  is  based  on  the 
fact  that  nearly  all  of  the  water  reaching  Egypt  comes  via  the  Nile  and 
passes  through  Sudan,  although  little  of  it  originates  there.  The  Nile 
water  question  also  affects  Sudan’s  relations  with  other  riparian  states, 
especially  Uganda  and  Ethiopia.  It  will  also  be  one  of  several  major 
factors  in  relations  with  its  newest,  and  tenth,  neighbor,  South  Sudan, 
once  it  becomes  independent  in  mid-20 1 1 . 

Some  Sudanese  governments,  especially  those  in  which  al-Turabi 
played  a  prominent  role,  emphasized  support  for  Islamism.  Al-Turabi 
created  the  now-dormant  Popular  Arab  and  Islamic  Conference  as  a 
radical  alternative  to  the  Arab  League,  an  association  of  22  mainly  Ara¬ 
bic-speaking  countries  dedicated  to  promoting  common  interests,  and  to 
the  Organization  of  the  Islamic  Conference,  a  group  of  57  states  that 
acts  to  safeguard  Muslim  values.  As  Sudan’s  oil  production  increased,  it 
also  became  of  greater  interest  to  countries  such  as  China,  India,  and 
Malaysia.  This  situation  gave  Sudan  added  foreign-policy  leverage  and 
hindered  the  ability  of  the  United  States  and  the  West  generally  to  put 
greater  pressure  on  Sudan  concerning  the  crisis  in  Darfur.

Government  and  Politics 


Egypt 

The  triangular  relationship  among  Britain,  Egypt,  and  Sudan  evolved 
during  the  period  of  Britain’s  rule  in  the  Nile  valley  between  1882  and 
1955.  Two  imperial  powers,  Britain  and  Egypt,  sought  to  control  Sudan. 
This  rivalry  led  to  the  rise  of  Sudanese  elites  who  tended  to  split  into 
anti-Egyptian  and  anti-British  factions.  The  British,  after  relinquishing 
control  at  Sudanese  independence,  found  it  relatively  easy  to  leave  the 
Sudanese  to  their  own  devices.  Egypt  still  shared  a  long  border  and  con¬ 
tinued  to  view  Sudan  as  part  of  its  backyard,  a  feature  of  the  bilateral 
relationship  that  Khartoum  found  especially  irksome. 

The  Nile,  Egypt’s  lifeline,  flows  through  Sudan  before  reaching 
Egypt.  An  estimated  95  percent  of  all  Egyptians  depend  on  the  Nile  for 
fresh  water.  In  1959  the  two  countries  agreed  on  a  formula  for  sharing 
the  water,  whereby  Sudan  was  authorized  to  use  approximately  one- 
quarter  of  the  flow  and  Egypt  about  three-quarters.  The  division  was 
predicated  on  a  set  annual  flow,  which  varies  enormously  from  year  to 
year.  There  is  usually  a  surplus  above  this  amount.  As  a  result,  use  of 
Nile  water  by  other  riparians  had  not,  by  201 1,  resulted  in  a  crisis  with 
Egypt  and  Sudan.  Nevertheless,  none  of  the  other  eight  riparian  states 
was  signature  to,  nor  received  any  water  allocation  in,  this  1959  bilat¬ 
eral  agreement.  Since  2000  Sudan  had  begun  expressing  an  interest  in 
changing  the  terms  of  the  agreement  so  that  it  would  be  able  to  use  a 
larger  percentage  of  the  flow.  Seven  of  the  eight  other  riparian  states — 
Burundi,  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Ethiopia,  Kenya, 
Rwanda,  Tanzania,  and  Uganda — also  pressed  for  a  revised  water- 
allocation  formula.  In  1999  the  nine  countries  formed  the  Nile  Basin 
Initiative  as  a  forum  for  discussion  about  cooperating  in  the  develop¬ 
ment  of  the  Nile  Basin.  Since  then,  no  agreement  had  been  reached  by 
2011,  mainly  because  Egypt  and  Sudan  refused  any  reduction  in  their 
share  of  water.  Egypt  was  also  concerned  that  the  2005  CPA  between 
Khartoum  and  the  SPLM  would  result  in  another  riparian  state  in 
South  Sudan.  Egypt  had  hoped  for  a  united  Sudan  because  South 
Sudan  will  be  another  state  with  which  it  might  have  to  negotiate  water 
rights.  In  2010  there  was  a  sharp  division  between  seven  of  the  riparian 
states,  which  reached  their  own  agreement,  and  opposition  to  that 
agreement  by  Egypt  and  Sudan. 

While  Egypt  and  Sudan  generally  agreed  on  the  Nile  water  ques¬ 
tion,  they  had  failed  to  resolve  a  longstanding  dispute  over  the  location 
of  their  border  near  the  Red  Sea,  an  area  called  the  Hala’ib  Triangle. 
Egypt  occupied  the  disputed  territory,  but  the  matter  remained  ripe  for 
future  conflict.  Al-Bashir  revived  the  controversy  as  recently  as  2010 
when  he  stated  that  Hala’ib  was  Sudanese  and  would  stay  Sudanese.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Relations  between  the  two  countries  since  the  1989  Sudanese  coup 
have  had  their  ups  and  downs.  They  reached  a  nadir  in  1995,  when  ele¬ 
ments  of  the  Sudanese  government  were  complicit  in  a  plot  by  an  Egyp¬ 
tian  terrorist  group,  Gama’a  Islamiyya,  to  assassinate  Egypt’s  president, 
Husni  Mubarak,  while  he  was  en  route  from  the  Addis  Ababa  airport  to 
an  Organization  of  African  Unity  (now  African  Union)  summit  in  Ethi¬ 
opia’s  capital.  By  the  end  of  1999,  Egyptian  anger  toward  Sudan  had 
subsided,  and  President  al-Bashir  visited  Egypt,  where  the  two  leaders 
agreed  to  normalize  diplomatic  relations.  Al-Bashir  returned  to  Cairo  in 
2002,  at  which  time  they  expanded  cooperation  on  a  variety  of  practical 
issues.  Mubarak  repaid  the  visit  by  going  to  Khartoum  the  following 
year.  In  2004  al-Bashir  again  went  to  Cairo,  where  the  two  leaders 
signed  the  Four  Freedoms  Agreement  dealing  with  freedom  of  owner¬ 
ship,  movement,  residence,  and  work  between  the  two  countries.  There 
has  been  cooperation  on  counterterrorism  and  development  projects 
drawing  water  from  the  Nile,  and  the  two  governments  agreed  to  estab¬ 
lish  a  free-trade  zone  along  the  Sudan-Egypt  border,  where  they  would 
exchange  commodities  free  of  duty.  Sudan  has  particularly  appreciated 
Egyptian  verbal  and  moral  support  for  its  policy  in  Darfur.  Egypt  also 
sent  troops  to  the  United  Nations-African  Union  Mission  in  Darfur. 
Egyptian  investments  in  Sudan  reached  US$2.5  billion  by  2008  while 
Sudanese  investments  in  Egypt  totaled  almost  US$200  million.  By 
2010  Egyptian-Sudanese  relations  were  better  than  they  had  been  in 
many  years,  although  several  long-term  contentious  issues,  such  as  the 
future  status  of  South  Sudan,  ownership  of  the  Hala’ib  Triangle,  and  use 
of  Nile  water,  remained  unresolved. 

Egypt  nevertheless  began  preparing  for  the  possible  independence 
of  South  Sudan.  In  an  effort  to  keep  track  of  developments  there, 
Egypt  had  about  1,500  military  personnel  assigned  to  UNMIS  and  had 
begun  supporting  a  number  of  development  projects  in  the  South.  It 
had  a  consulate  in  Juba,  and  Mubarak  traveled  there  in  2008.  Salva 
Kiir  visited  Cairo  in  2009,  when  Egypt  made  clear  it  would  accept  the 
results  of  the  January  2011  referendum  on  secession.  In  2010,  Egypt 
also  offered  a  US$300  million  grant  for  Southern  water  and  electricity 
projects  along  the  Nile. 

Libya 

Libya  and  Sudan  share  an  isolated  border  along  a  comer  of  north¬ 
western  Sudan  that  neither  government  has  ever  fully  controlled.  This 
state  of  affairs  left  open  the  possibility  for  a  variety  of  real  and  per¬ 
ceived  activities  in  the  region  that  caused  Khartoum  to  suspect  that 
Libya  periodically  acted  against  its  interests.  In  addition,  Libyan  leader 
Muammar  al-Qadhafi  had  a  long  history  of  providing  financial  support

Republic  of  the  Sudan,

to  the  SPLA.  He  had  a  lengthy,  personal  relationship  with  John 
Garang.  During  the  civil  war  between  Khartoum  and  the  SPLA,  this 
relationship  raised  serious  questions  among  Sudanese  leaders  concern¬ 
ing  Libya’s  intentions.  Libya  also  remained  in  contact  with  Northern 
Sudanese  opposition  figures  and  for  many  years  had  ties  to  dissidents 
in  Darfur,  causing  concern  in  Khartoum  that  Libya  might  support  the 
rebel  movements  that  initiated  the  conflict. 

In  the  early  2000s,  Sudan  and  Libya  made  concerted  efforts  to 
improve  relations.  The  last  half  of  2002  witnessed  a  series  of  high-level 
meetings  between  Libya  and  Sudan.  The  Sudanese  foreign  minister  at 
the  time,  Mustafa  Uthman  Isma’il,  and  his  Libyan  counterpart  agreed 
to  work  for  peace  in  Sudan  within  the  framework  of  Sudanese  unity, 
establish  a  committee  for  political  coordination,  and  take  measures  to 
implement  agreements  on  customs,  the  Nile  international  fund,  trade, 
taxation,  and  investment.  Also  in  2002,  the  Higher  Ministerial  Com¬ 
mittee  for  Libyan-Sudanese  Integration  agreed  on  a  number  of  politi¬ 
cal  and  practical  issues,  including  condemnation  of  American  threats  to 
launch  “unjustified  aggression”  against  Iraq.  In  2004,  as  the  crisis  in 
Darfur  worsened,  Libya  hosted  informal  consultations  between  repre¬ 
sentatives  of  the  Sudanese  government  and  the  rebel  movements.  The 
rebels  rejected  the  Libyan  initiative  and  insisted  that  the  Joint  Commis¬ 
sion  of  the  African  Union  serve  as  the  principal  interlocutor.  This 
development  did  not  deter  First  Vice  President  Taha  in  2005  from  urg¬ 
ing  al-Qadhafi  to  help  find  a  solution  to  the  Darfur  crisis.  Relations 
between  Libya  and  Sudan  were  generally  good  but  remained  unpre¬ 
dictable,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the  mercurial  leadership  in  Tripoli. 


279 


Sudan:  A  Country’  Study 


Sudan  saw  al-Qadhafi  as  a  periodic  problem  that  needed  to  be  con¬ 
tained.  It  was  better  to  bring  him  into  the  tent  than  to  try  to  exclude 
him.  As  a  result,  Sudan  did  not  object  to  al-Qadhafi ’s  efforts  to  mediate 
both  the  Darfur  conflict  and  the  earlier  conflict  in  Eastern  Sudan.  The 
two  countries  settled  on  a  policy  of  coexistence. 

Ethiopia  and  Eritrea 

Sudan’s  relations  with  Ethiopia  date  back  to  antiquity.  One  of  Ethio¬ 
pia’s  principal  trade  routes  ran  west  to  Sudan  and  then  to  Egypt  and  the 
Mediterranean.  Muslim  merchants  from  Sudan  have  been  an  important 
part  of  Ethiopia’s  trade  for  many  centuries.  Relations  were  not,  how¬ 
ever,  always  cordial.  Military  conflict  broke  out  between  Ethiopians 
and  Sudanese  in  the  1850s.  Sudanese  Mahdists,  or  dervishes  as  they 
also  were  called,  then  advanced  into  Ethiopia  in  1885,  resulting  in  a 
series  of  battles  between  Sudanese  Muslims  and  Ethiopian  Christians 
over  the  next  four  years.  Relations  improved  during  the  twentieth  cen¬ 
tury.  Emperor  Haile  Selassie,  who  had  been  in  exile  during  the  1936-41 
Italian  occupation  of  Ethiopia,  returned  with  the  help  of  Ethiopian,  Brit¬ 
ish,  and  Sudanese  forces  from  Sudan.  Relations  became  tense  again  in 
the  late  1950s  as  Ethiopia  supported  the  South  Sudanese  Anya  Nya  reb¬ 
els  in  their  battle  against  Khartoum.  Haile  Selassie,  however,  helped 
broker  the  1972  Addis  Ababa  Agreement  that  ended  the  first  civil  war 
between  North  and  South. 

Ethiopia’s  military  government  under  Mengistu  Haile  Mariam 
(1974-91)  strongly  supported  the  SPLM/A  against  the  government  in 
Khartoum.  The  successor  Tigray-dominated  government,  when  it  oper¬ 
ated  as  a  rebel  movement,  often  took  refuge  in  Sudan  during  its  strug¬ 
gle  to  overthrow  Mengistu.  After  taking  power  in  1991,  it  established 
cordial  relations  with  Khartoum.  This  era  of  cooperation  faded  quickly 
as  Islamic  militants  in  Sudan  tried  to  export  their  ideas  to  neighboring 
countries,  including  Ethiopia.  Eritrea  gained  de  facto  independence 
from  Ethiopia  in  1991  and  formal  independence  two  years  later.  By  the 
end  of  1993,  Eritrea  had  charged  Sudan  with  supporting  the  activities 
of  Eritrean  Islamic  Jihad,  which  carried  out  attacks  against  the  Asmara 
regime.  Eritrea  broke  relations  with  Sudan  at  the  end  of  1 994,  became  a 
strong  supporter  of  the  SPLM/A,  and  permitted  the  opposition  National 
Democratic  Alliance  to  locate  its  headquarters  in  the  former  Sudan 
embassy  in  Asmara.  Sudan’s  relations  with  Ethiopia  reached  a  low  in 
1 995  following  Sudanese  complicity  in  the  attempted  assassination  of 
Egyptian  president  Mubarak  as  he  was  visiting  Addis  Ababa.  At  the 
urging  of  the  United  States,  Ethiopia  and  Eritrea  joined  Uganda  in  the 
so-called  Front  Line  States  strategy,  which  was  designed  to  put  military 
pressure  on  Khartoum.  In  1997  Ethiopian  forces  joined  the  SPLA  in  a

Government  and  Politics 


cross-border  attack  that  resulted  in  the  capture  of  the  border  town  of 
Kurmuk  and  a  second  small  town  in  Sudan’s  Blue  Nile  State. 

Eritrea’s  surprise  May  1998  invasion  of  the  Ethiopian-administered 
border  village  of  Badme  dramatically  changed  the  political  situation  in 
the  region.  Operating  on  the  axiom  that  the  “enemy  of  my  enemy  is  my 
friend,”  Ethiopia  normalized  relations  with  Sudan  by  the  end  of  1998, 
and  Eritrea  reestablished  ties  with  Khartoum  in  2000.  Although  Sudan 
and  Eritrea  continued  to  maintain  diplomatic  relations,  real  improve¬ 
ment  in  ties  was  short  lived.  Sudan  closed  its  border  with  Eritrea  in 
2002,  and  the  Sudanese  foreign  minister  charged  in  February  2003  that 
Eritrea  had  amassed  forces  along  the  border  with  Sudan.  Khartoum  also 
accused  Eritrea  of  supporting  rebel  groups  in  Darfur.  The  presidents  of 
Sudan  and  Eritrea  met  for  the  first  time  in  five  years  in  mid-2006  in 
Khartoum.  Eritrea  played  a  prominent  role  in  brokering  a  peace  agree¬ 
ment  between  Khartoum  and  Sudan’s  Eastern  Front.  This  put  Sudan- 
Eritrea  relations  on  a  new,  positive  track,  although  Sudan  remained 
worried  about  Eritrea’s  activities  in  Darfur.  The  nations’  leaders  met 
again  in  Khartoum  near  the  end  of  2006  and  frequently  in  subsequent 
years.  In  2007  President  Isaias  Afwerki  also  met  with  Salva  Kiir  in 
Juba.  Isaias  described  relations  with  Sudan  as  resting  on  solid  ground 
and  having  “bright  prospects.”  Eritrea  seemed  to  have  ended  its  contacts 
with  Darfur  rebel  groups  and  become  supportive  of  the  NPC  in  Sudan. 
It  also  established  a  consulate-general  in  South  Sudan’s  capital  of  Juba, 
and  its  consul-general  in  May  2010  expressed  support  for  the  principle 
of  self-detennination.  The  same  month,  Yemane  Ghebremeskel,  a 
senior  adviser  to  Isaias,  commented  that  Eritrea  hoped  the  January  2011 
referendum  would  lead  to  the  unity  of  Sudan. 

Good  relations  between  Sudan  and  Ethiopia  continued  in  spite  of 
Sudan’s  improved  ties  with  Eritrea.  President  al-Bashir  visited  Addis 
Ababa  twice  in  2001.  During  a  visit  to  Khartoum  in  2002,  Ethiopia’s 
prime  minister,  Meles  Zenawi,  hailed  Ethiopian-Sudanese  ties.  The  two 
countries  agreed  to  cancel  entry  visas  and  fees  on  traded  commodities,  and 
they  stepped  up  plans  to  increase  trade.  Ethiopia  began  early  in  2003  to 
import  oil  from  Sudan.  By  2009  Sudan  supplied  80  percent  of  Ethiopia’s 
demand  for  oil.  The  two  nations  signed  an  agreement  ending  a  dispute 
involving  their  1,600-kilometer  border,  and  landlocked  Ethiopia  made 
plans  to  make  greater  use  of  Port  Sudan  as  a  transshipment  point.  Ethio¬ 
pia,  Sudan,  and  Yemen  formed  a  regional  group  early  in  2003  that  they 
said  was  designed  to  “combat  terrorism”  in  the  Horn  of  Africa.  Eritrea 
insisted  that  it  was  an  alliance  aimed  against  the  government  in  Asmara.  It 
subsequently  became  inactive  following  Sudan’s  improved  ties  with  Eri¬ 
trea.  In  May  2010,  both  Meles  and  Isaias  attended  the  swearing-in  cere¬ 
mony  in  Khartoum  for  al-Bashir  following  his  election. 


281 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Bilateral  relations  among  countries  in  the  Horn  of  Africa  tended  to 
be  fickle.  However,  Ethiopia  and  Sudan  continued  to  make  progress  on 
settling  border  issues.  The  Ethiopian  prime  minister  and  Sudanese  pres¬ 
ident  inaugurated  a  major  new  road  link  between  Ethiopia  and  Sudan  at 
the  end  of  2007.  South  Sudan’s  president  Salva  Kiir  also  led  a  delega¬ 
tion  to  Ethiopia  at  the  end  of  2007  when  the  two  sides  signed  technical- 
assistance  and  transport-sector  agreements.  There  were  frequent  subse¬ 
quent  exchange  visits  by  Ethiopian  and  Sudanese  leaders.  Ethiopia 
remained  wary,  however,  of  any  effort  by  Sudan  to  return  to  a  policy 
supporting  Islamist  militancy  in  the  region.  Although  Ethiopia  pre¬ 
ferred  a  united  Sudan,  it  shored  up  its  relations  with  South  Sudan  on  the 
assumption  that  it  would  opt  for  secession.  Ethiopia  began  resupplying 
the  SPLA  with  military  equipment  as  early  as  2008.  Sudan,  Ethiopia, 
and  Eritrea  were  periodic  recipients  of  refugees  from  the  other  coun¬ 
tries,  another  potential  cause  of  friction.  Agreement  on  usage  of  Nile 
water  reemerged  as  an  important  issue  between  Addis  Ababa  and  Khar¬ 
toum,  while  Asmara  supported  the  Sudanese  position  as  another  way  to 
irritate  Ethiopia.  Ethiopia  desired  a  revision  of  the  1959  water-sharing 
agreement  that  involved  only  Egypt  and  Sudan.  Although  not  entirely 
happy  with  the  1959  agreement,  Sudan  wanted  to  leave  the  water-shar¬ 
ing  provision  in  place. 

Chad  and  the  Central  African  Republic 

Sudan’s  border  with  both  Chad  and  the  Central  African  Republic 
had  a  certain  “Wild  West”  quality  to  it  in  the  early  2000s.  The  govern¬ 
ments  of  both  countries  to  the  west  of  the  border  and  that  of  Sudan  did 
not  have  firm  control  over  territory  under  their  jurisdiction.  Both  sides 
of  the  Chad  border  have  served  as  a  launching  pad  for  Chadian  rebels 
trying  to  overthrow  the  government  in  N’Djamena.  There  was  always 
considerable  movement  across  this  border;  the  ethnic  groups  on  each 
side  being  related.  As  recently  as  2003,  there  were  only  about  13,000 
Sudanese  refugees  in  Chad  and  virtually  no  Chadian  refugees  in  Sudan. 
As  a  result  of  the  crisis  in  Darfur,  the  number  of  Sudanese  refugees  in 
Chad  jumped  to  more  than  250,000,  and  large  numbers  of  Chadians 
took  refuge  in  Sudan.  The  two  governments  signed  a  series  of  agree¬ 
ments  on  political  cooperation  and  security  along  their  border.  Chadian 
president  Idriss  Deby,  a  Zaghawa  who  came  from  the  Sudan  border 
area,  worked  hard  but  without  success  to  mediate  an  end  to  the  dispute 
between  the  government  in  Khartoum  and  the  Darfur  rebel  groups. 

Sudanese-Chadian  relations  significantly  deteriorated  in  2005  as 
both  countries  allowed  their  territory  to  be  used  for  subversive  activi¬ 
ties  against  the  other.  Darfur  and  the  situation  along  the  border  became 
part  of  a  Zaghawa  power  struggle  in  Chad.  Libya  mediated  the  dispute

Government  and  Politics 


and  convinced  Chad  and  Sudan  to  sign  the  Tripoli  Declaration  and 
Agreement  of  February  8,  2006.  But  an  April  2006  attack  by  Chadian 
rebels  against  the  Deby  government  in  N’Djamena  nearly  toppled  it. 
Deby  accused  Sudan  of  supporting  the  effort  and  broke  diplomatic 
relations  with  Khartoum.  By  November  2006,  Deby  declared  that  Chad 
was  in  a  state  of  war  with  Sudan.  Following  deadly  clashes  along  the 
Sudan-Chad  border  in  April  2007,  Chad’s  foreign  minister  said  it  was 
time  to  turn  the  page  and  improve  relations  with  Sudan.  The  two  coun¬ 
tries  set  up  a  joint  military  committee  to  monitor  the  border  and  in  May 
the  two  presidents  signed  a  reconciliation  accord  in  Saudi  Arabia.  By 
the  beginning  of  2008,  however,  relations  had  again  deteriorated,  with 
the  leader  of  each  country  accusing  the  other  of  conducting  cross-bor¬ 
der  attacks.  In  March  2008,  launching  from  Chad,  a  number  of  JEM 
troops  reached  Omdurman  on  the  outskirts  of  Khartoum.  Further 
efforts  by  both  Libya  and  Qatar  to  improve  relations  between  the  two 
produced  a  security  agreement  in  late  2009  to  control  rebel  movements 
from  Chad  into  Sudan.  In  February  2010,  Deby  visited  Khartoum 
where  he  and  al-Bashir  agreed  to  normalize  relations.  The  first  fruit  of 
these  developments  was  a  framework  agreement  between  Khartoum 
and  the  main  JEM  rebel  group,  signed  in  N’djamena  on  February  20, 
providing  for  a  cease-fire  and  for  further  negotiations  in  Doha,  Qatar. 
Al-Bashir  then  released  more  than  half  of  the  prisoners  held  since  the 
JEM  attack  on  Omdurman.  In  2010  Chad  refused  permission  for  the 
leader  of  the  JEM  to  land  in  N’Djamena.  By  late  2010,  Sudan  and 
Chad  had  normalized  their  relations,  and  Deby  publicly  stated  his 
opposition  to  a  North-South  division  of  Sudan. 

From  Bangui’s  perspective,  the  major  long-term  problem  in  relations 
with  Sudan  was  penetration  of  its  wide  open  eastern  frontier  by  cattle 
raiders  and  poachers.  Some  of  Sudan’s  border  with  the  Central  African 
Republic  (CAR)  is  contiguous  to  territory  that  was  under  the  control  of 
South  Sudan  in  2010.  Even  when  the  SPLM/A  was  at  war  with  Khar¬ 
toum,  the  conflict  did  not  discourage  al-Bashir ’s  government  from 
engaging  actively  with  the  CAR.  Sudan  had  cordial  relations  with  former 
CAR  president  Ange-Felix  Patasse,  who  was  overthrown  in  a  military 
coup  by  General  Francois  Bozize  in  March  2003.  Sudan  initially  estab¬ 
lished  good  relations  with  the  new  leader.  The  two  presidents  met  on  a 
number  of  occasions.  The  CAR,  Chad,  and  Sudan  signed  joint  security 
agreements  in  December  2004  to  monitor  the  situation  along  their  bor¬ 
ders,  prevent  infiltration,  and  combat  illegal  hunting.  The  conflict  in  Dar¬ 
fur  contributed  to  internal  problems  in  the  CAR,  which  accused  Sudan  in 
2006  of  trying  to  destabilize  the  country.  A  summit  meeting  in  France 
early  in  2007  involving  the  presidents  of  Sudan,  the  CAR,  and  Chad 
resulted  in  an  agreement  not  to  back  insurgencies  in  their  respective

countries.  The  UN  Security  Council  established  in  September  2007  the 
Mission  in  the  Central  African  Republic  and  Chad  (MINURCAT)  to 
protect  civilians,  promote  human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law,  and  promote 
regional  peace.  The  UN  Security  Council  shut  down  the  mission,  as 
agreed,  by  the  end  of  2010.  In  the  early  1990s,  there  were  as  many  as 
36,000  South  Sudanese  refugees  in  the  CAR.  Nearly  all  of  them  returned 
to  South  Sudan. 

The  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Uganda,  and 
Kenya 

Khartoum  did  not  control  most  of  the  territory  bordering  the  Demo¬ 
cratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  (DRC)  when  South  Sudan  was  in  rebel¬ 
lion.  The  SPLA  and  the  Khartoum-supported  Equatoria  Defense  Force 
traditionally  dominated  this  area.  Nevertheless,  the  al-Bashir  govern¬ 
ment  conducted  active  diplomacy  with  the  DRC.  After  Joseph  Kabila 
succeeded  his  father  as  president,  he  visited  Khartoum  in  2002.  The 
two  countries  agreed  to  consolidate  bilateral  relations,  and  there  were  a 
number  of  subsequent  high-level  meetings  between  the  two  govern¬ 
ments.  The  end  of  war  between  the  SPLM/A  and  the  government  in 
Khartoum  offered  the  opportunity  for  stronger  DRC-Sudanese  ties,  but 
increasingly  Kinshasa’s  contact  will  be  with  South  Sudan  authorities  in 
Juba.  The  United  Nations  High  Commission  for  Refugees  (UNHCR) 
repatriated  nearly  all  of  the  South  Sudanese  from  the  DRC  to  South 
Sudan.  In  December  2008,  the  DRC  allowed  armed  forces  from  South 
Sudan  and  Uganda  to  enter  its  territory  for  a  joint  operation  aimed  at 
ridding  the  area  of  the  Lord’s  Resistance  Army  (LRA).  Kinshasa  is  far 
from  the  Sudan  border  and  the  DRC  remained  preoccupied  with  inter¬ 
nal  conflicts. 

During  most  of  the  time  since  the  early  1 990s,  Uganda’s  relationship 
with  Sudan  was  determined  by  Kampala’s  support  for  the  SPLM/A  and 
Khartoum’s  assistance  to  various  Ugandan  rebel  groups,  especially  the 
LRA  led  by  Joseph  Kony,  whose  goal  was  to  overthrow  the  Ugandan 
government.  Uganda  severed  ties  with  Sudan  in  1995.  Several  parties, 
including  Libyan  president  al-Qadhafi  and  the  Atlanta-based  Carter 
Center,  worked  hard  to  end  the  conflict  between  Sudan  and  Uganda. 
Early  in  2002,  Uganda’s  president,  Yoweri  Museveni,  visited  Khar¬ 
toum  and  agreed  to  reestablish  full  diplomatic  relations.  Sudan  said  it 
was  prepared  to  sell  oil  to  Uganda,  which  subsequently  discovered  its 
own  oil,  and  to  cooperate  in  suppressing  the  LRA.  As  part  of  Uganda’s 
Operation  Iron  List,  Sudan  permitted  Ugandan  forces  to  enter  South 
Sudan  to  track  down  LRA  insurgents.  President  al-Bashir  subsequently 
visited  Kampala  on  several  occasions  in  efforts  to  improve  relations 
with  Uganda.  The  two  countries  renewed  a  military  protocol  for  this 


284 


Government  and  Politics 


purpose  in  2006.  Early  in  2007,  Uganda  signed  an  agreement  with  the 
GOSS  to  provide  military  training  and  to  upgrade  infrastructure 
between  the  two  countries.  There  were  once  about  250,000  South 
Sudanese  refugees  in  northern  Uganda;  by  2010,  most  of  then  had 
returned  to  South  Sudan.  Uganda  and  South  Sudan  were  improving 
their  communication  links  and  expanding  commerce.  Increasingly,  it 
appeared  that  Uganda  favored  the  independence  of  South  Sudan. 

Kenya  and  Sudan  have  had  cordial  relations  since  Kenya’s  indepen¬ 
dence  in  1963.  Kenya  also  maintained  close  contact  with  the  SPLM/A. 
The  Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Development  (IGAD)  mandated 
Kenya  to  lead  the  effort  to  end  the  civil  war  in  Sudan.  After  years  of 
false  starts  and  tepid  interest  by  Nairobi,  Kenya’s  General  Lazaro 
Sumbeiywo  took  charge  of  the  process  in  2002  and  saw  it  through  to 
completion  in  January  2005.  Kenya  benefited  during  the  civil  war 
because  Nairobi  served  as  the  principal  base  for  relief  operations  in 
South  Sudan,  resulting  in  millions  of  dollars  of  aid  flowing  through  the 
country.  The  end  to  the  conflict  promised  even  greater  benefits  for 
Kenya.  The  SPLM/A  opened  talks  with  Kenya  in  2004  on  construction 
of  a  rail  link  between  Juba  and  Kenya’s  port  of  Mombasa.  They  also 
began  discussion  about  construction  of  a  pipeline  from  South  Sudan  to 
the  Kenyan  coast  that  would  allow  the  export  of  oil  to  both  Kenya  and 
the  international  market.  Al-Bashir  visited  Kenya  early  in  2005  to  sign 
the  CPA.  There  was  a  long-standing  border  issue  that  became  more  of 
a  concern  for  Kenya’s  relations  with  South  Sudan.  There  had  never 
been  a  resolution  over  the  sovereignty  of  the  Elemi  Triangle,  a  small 
piece  of  land  near  the  Kenya-South  Sudan-Ethiopia  tripoint  claimed 
by  both  Kenya  and  Sudan.  The  Kenya-South  Sudan  border  also  had  a 
long  history  of  cattle  raids  and  weapons  trafficking. 

Kenya,  Uganda,  and  Sudan  were  all  members  of  the  Common  Mar¬ 
ket  for  Eastern  and  Southern  Africa,  a  grouping  of  20  African  states  cre¬ 
ated  in  1 994  to  develop  a  free-trade  area  for  the  purpose  of  removing  all 
tariffs  and  barriers.  Kenya  and  Sudan  would  likely  be  the  major  benefi¬ 
ciaries  of  increased  trade  under  this  arrangement.  Since  the  signing  of 
the  CPA,  Kenyan  businessmen  and  aid  specialists  have  flocked  to  South 
Sudan.  Kenya  pledged  US$3.5  million  for  the  development  and  recon¬ 
struction  of  South  Sudan  and  began  to  train  the  police.  It  expected  to 
provide  training  in  the  areas  of  public  administration,  government  oper¬ 
ations,  health,  education,  telecommunications,  and  aviation.  South 
Sudan  imported  significant  quantities  of  military  equipment,  including 
tanks,  through  Kenya’s  port  of  Mombasa.  In  2010  Kenya  had  more  than 
700  troops,  police,  and  observers  in  South  Sudan  with  UNMIS.  Discus¬ 
sions  were  underway  concerning  unresolved  border  issues  and  refugee 
repatriation.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


African  Regional  Organizations 

Sudan  was  an  active  member  of  all  pertinent  African  organizations 
and  was  a  charter  member  of  the  Organization  of  African  Unity 
(OAU),  established  in  1 963  and  headquartered  in  Addis  Ababa.  Dur¬ 
ing  most  of  its  time  as  a  member  of  the  OAU,  it  used  its  membership 
to  keep  the  OAU  out  of  the  civil  war.  Even  so,  in  1 994,  the  OAU  man¬ 
dated  that  negotiations  toward  ending  the  civil  war  be  undertaken. 
Sudan  consistently  made  its  presence  known  in  the  OAU  and  contin¬ 
ued  to  do  so  in  its  successor  forum,  the  African  Union  (AU),  created  in 
2002.  In  contrast  to  its  policy  of  keeping  the  OAU  out  of  the  war  in  the 
South,  Sudan  accepted  8,000  AU  troops  in  troubled  Darfur,  conclud¬ 
ing  that  it  was  preferable  to  have  an  AU  peacekeeping  mission  than 
one  from  the  UN.  However,  Sudan  both  limited  the  number  of  AU 
troops  and  confined  their  role  to  monitoring  the  situation  rather  than 
engaging  in  more  proactive  peacekeeping.  In  mid-2007,  al-Bashir 
finally  agreed  to  allow  UN  forces  to  join  AU  peacekeeping  operations 
in  Darfur  (see  AU  and  UN  Forces  in  Darfur,  ch.  5).  The  crisis  in  Dar¬ 
fur  prevented  Sudan  from  taking  its  turn  in  2006  to  assume  the  chair¬ 
manship  of  the  AU;  most  AU  members  wanted  Sudan  to  make  more 
progress  in  ending  the  Darfur  conflict.  Subsequent  indictment  by  the 
ICC  further  complicated  al-Bashir’s  situation,  and  the  AU  has  contin¬ 
ued  to  pass  over  his  name  in  selecting  a  chairman. 

Sudan  was  a  charter  member  of  IGAD,  established  in  1 996  as  the 
successor  to  an  earlier  regional  grouping.  The  focus  of  IGAD  in  the 
early  2000s  was  regional  cooperation  among  its  seven  member  states. 
IGAD  played  a  critical  role  in  ending  the  war  between  Khartoum  and 
the  SPLM/A  but  otherwise  was  not  effective  in  mediating  regional  con¬ 
flicts  because  of  serious  differences  among  its  members,  especially 
Ethiopia  and  Eritrea.  Sudan  was  a  member  of  the  Common  Market  for 
Eastern  and  Southern  Africa  (COMESA)  and  was  one  of  1 1  COMESA 
nations  that  had  joined  in  a  free-trade  area  and  agreed  to  eliminate  tar¬ 
iffs  on  goods  originating  in  member  countries.  Sudan  joined  the  28- 
member  economic  union  led  by  Libya  known  as  the  Community  of 
Sahel-Saharan  States.  Sudan  also  belonged  to  the  African  Development 
Bank  (ADB)  and  received  significant  assistance  from  that  organization. 
It  had  been  in  arrears  to  the  ADB  since  1995  but  had  begun  making 
payments  in  order  to  pay  down  the  debt.  Sudan  was  an  active  member 
of  the  Nile  Basin  Initiative,  which  brought  the  riparian  states  together 
to  discuss  technical  and  political  cooperation  related  to  Nile  water 
issues.

Government  and  Politics 


Iraq,  Iran,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  Yemen 

During  the  war  between  Iraq  and  Iran  in  the  1980s,  Sudan  main¬ 
tained  a  careful  balancing  act,  calling  for  a  cessation  of  hostilities  but 
sympathizing  with  Iraq.  Sudan  on  several  occasions  offered  to  mediate 
the  conflict.  By  1988,  Sudan  called  for  an  end  to  the  war  on  the  basis  of 
UN  Security  Council  Resolution  598.  Sudan  supported  Iraq’s  invasion 
of  Kuwait  in  1 990,  leading  to  a  period  of  close  relations  with  Baghdad. 
Iraq  was  believed  to  have  supplied  weapons  to  Sudan  and  in  the  mid- 
1990s  agreed  to  help  Sudan  exploit  its  oil  wealth.  Although  Sudan  was 
trying  to  improve  relations  with  the  United  States  after  the  September 
1 1 ,  200 1 ,  terrorist  attacks,  it  remained  critical  of  the  subsequent  Ameri¬ 
can-led  invasion  of  Iraq.  Following  the  overthrow  of  the  Ba’athist 
regime,  however,  Sudan’s  position  on  Iraq  became  more  nuanced.  On 
the  one  hand,  it  was  quick  to  criticize  the  United  States,  which  harshly 
condemned  Sudan’s  record  on  human  rights,  for  its  double  standard  in 
dealing  with  prisoners  in  Iraq.  It  also  advised  Sudanese  not  to  work 
with  U.S.  contractors  in  the  country.  By  late  2004,  however,  Sudan’s 
relations  with  the  new  Iraqi  government  had  improved  to  the  point  that 
Iraq’s  foreign  minister  visited  Khartoum  and  met  with  al-Bashir.  Sub¬ 
sequently,  Sudan  generally  avoided  commenting  on  Iraq. 

Sudan  had  a  long,  if  inconsistent,  relationship  with  Iran,  which 
deteriorated  when  Sudan  supported  Iraq  during  the  1990-91  Gulf  War 
but  began  to  improve  by  the  mid-1990s.  Sudanese-Iranian  interaction 
increased  significantly  in  2004.  The  two  countries  signed  a  memoran¬ 
dum  on  security  cooperation,  and  Sudan  stressed  Iran’s  right  to  use 
nuclear  energy  for  peaceful  purposes.  During  the  eighth  session  of  the 
Iran-Sudan  joint  economic  commission,  the  two  sides  agreed  to 
increase  technical,  educational,  and  research  cooperation  in  the  agri¬ 
cultural  sector.  Iranian  president  Muhammad  Khatami,  during  a  visit 
to  Sudan  in  October  2004,  supported  Khartoum’s  controversial  han¬ 
dling  of  the  Darfur  crisis  and  signed  bilateral  cooperation  agreements 
on  economic,  agricultural,  and  banking  issues.  As  Iran  became  an 
increasingly  important  actor  in  the  Middle  East,  Sudan  increased  its 
interaction  with  Tehran.  Al-Bashir  visited  Iran  in  April  2006.  Sudan’s 
defense  minister  discussed  Iranian  weapons  sales  and  training  for 
Khartoum’s  security  forces  during  a  visit  to  Tehran  in  January  2007. 
Iranian  president  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  visited  Khartoum  in  Febru¬ 
ary  2007,  when  he  voiced  strong  support  for  Sudan  and  signed  seven 
agreements.  There  continued  to  be  high-level  contact  between  Sudan 
and  Iran.  Sunni  Sudan  did  not  find  forging  close  relations  with  Shia 
Iran  an  insuperable  difficulty,  and  Sudan  was  arguably  Iran’s  closest 
friend  in  Africa.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Saudi  Arabia  had  been  an  important  source  of  financial  support  for 
Sudan  prior  to  the  1990-91  Gulf  War.  Sudan’s  support  for  Iraq  adversely 
affected  its  relations  with  Saudi  Arabia,  and  al-Turabi’s  brand  of  Isla- 
mism  was  not  in  tune  with  Saudi  Wahhabi  philosophy.  Riyadh  sus¬ 
pended  grants,  project  loans,  and  concessionary  oil  sales.  This  action  had 
a  devastating  impact  on  Sudan’s  budget  and  economy.  The  relationship 
normalized  by  1995  and  continued  to  improve.  The  two  countries  signed 
an  agreement  in  2004  to  set  up  a  political  coordination  committee.  Al- 
Bashir  visited  Saudi  Arabia  in  May  2004,  and  Saudi  leaders  subsequently 
supported  Sudan’s  handling  of  the  crisis  in  Darfur.  In  2005  the  two  coun¬ 
tries  signed  two  security  agreements  on  combating  crime,  drug  traffick¬ 
ing,  and  terrorism.  Saudi  Arabia  also  began  providing  assistance  for 
development  projects  in  South  Sudan.  Significant  numbers  of  Sudanese 
had  for  many  years  worked  in  Saudi  Arabia,  a  factor  that  increased  the 
importance  of  the  relationship. 

Relations  between  Yemen  and  Sudan  were  not  particularly  strong, 
but  they  took  on  added  importance  after  Yemen,  Sudan,  and  Ethiopia 
developed  an  alliance  late  in  2003.  The  leaders  of  the  three  countries 
subsequently  met  frequently;  the  focus  of  their  concern  was  often  Eri¬ 
trea.  This  alliance  took  an  interesting  twist  at  the  end  of  2004,  when 
Yemeni  president  Ali  Abdallah  Salih  offered  to  mediate  differences 
between  Sudan  and  Eritrea.  As  Sudan-Eritrea  relations  improved,  the 
tripartite  alliance  with  Ethiopia  became  dormant.  The  heads  of  gov¬ 
ernment  of  Sudan,  Yemen,  Ethiopia,  and  Somalia  did  meet  in  Addis 
Ababa  early  in  2007,  where  they  focused  on  the  situation  in  Somalia. 
Sudan  and  Yemen  also  signed  14  cooperative  agreements  in  mid- 
2007.  Sudan-Yemen  relations  were  cordial  in  early  2011  but  less  sig¬ 
nificant  than  they  had  been  several  years  before. 

Arab  and  Islamic  Organizations 

Sudan  joined  the  Arab  League  at  independence  in  1956  and  used  the 
organization  over  the  years  at  every  possible  opportunity  to  support  its 
policies.  Following  the  outbreak  of  conflict  in  Darfur  in  2003  and  sharp 
criticism  of  its  policies  by  Western  countries,  Sudan  relied  on  strong 
support  from  the  Arab  League.  The  Arab  League  opposed  sanctions 
against  Sudan,  and  several  members  provided  humanitarian  aid  to  refu¬ 
gees  fleeing  the  fighting.  By  the  end  of  2004,  the  Arab  League  joined 
the  cease-fire  monitoring  committee  for  Darfur.  Al-Bashir  served  as  the 
Arab  League  chairman  in  2006.  Sudan  joined  the  Organization  of  the 
Islamic  Conference  (OIC)  in  1969.  It  sought  support  in  the  organization 
for  activities  such  as  the  reconstruction  of  war-ravaged  South  Sudan. 
Like  the  Arab  League,  the  OIC  supported  Khartoum’s  actions  in  Dar¬ 
fur.  Sudan  was  also  a  member  of  a  number  of  other  Arab  or  Islamic 


288 


Government  and  Politics 


regional  organizations,  including  the  Arab  Bank  for  Economic  Devel¬ 
opment  in  Africa,  the  Arab  Monetary  Fund,  and  the  Islamic  Develop¬ 
ment  Bank. 

China,  Russia,  India,  and  Malaysia 

Sudan  established  diplomatic  relations  with  China  in  1959  and  was 
one  of  the  first  countries  to  back  China’s  admission  to  the  United 
Nations.  Sudan  and  China  subsequently  signed  a  series  of  commercial 
and  assistance  agreements.  During  a  visit  to  China  in  1995,  al-Bashir 
underscored  Sudan’s  position  that  Taiwan  is  an  integral  part  of  China. 
Sudan’s  foreign  minister  visited  China  in  1999,  when  the  Chinese  for¬ 
eign  minister  thanked  Sudan  for  its  support  of  Chinese  reunification 
and  opposition  to  criticism  of  its  human-rights  record.  China  turned  to 
Sudan  as  a  source  of  oil  in  the  late  1 990s  and  became  its  most  impor¬ 
tant  petroleum  partner.  The  number  of  agreements  signed  by  the  two 
countries  increased  exponentially.  China  obtained  about  5  percent  of 
its  oil  imports  from  Sudan  and  had  invested  about  US$6  billion  there 
by  2010.  Sudanese  exports  of  oil  to  China  were  more  than  half  of  its 
total  oil  exports.  China  developed  several  oil  fields  and  built  a  refinery, 
a  port,  and  a  1,610-kilometer  pipeline  from  the  oil  fields  to  Port  Sudan. 
China’s  national  oil  company  had  a  40  percent  stake  in  Sudan’s 
national  oil  company,  the  Greater  Nile  Petroleum  Operating  Company. 
China  won  a  US$650  million  contract  to  build  a  significant  part  of  the 
hydroelectric  dam  at  Merowe,  on  the  Nile  north  of  Khartoum;  most  of 
the  managers,  technicians,  and  engineers  were  Chinese.  China  thus 
became  Sudan’s  most  important  commercial  and  economic  partner 
and  its  most  important  political  partner  outside  Africa  and  the  Arab 
world. 

China  was  a  major  provider  of  military  equipment,  including 
fighter  aircraft  and  artillery,  and  invested  in  Sudan’s  arms  manufac¬ 
turing  industry.  The  threat  of  a  Chinese  veto  in  the  United  Nations 
Security  Council  provided  cover  for  Sudan  during  that  body’s  debate 
on  Darfur.  China  threatened  in  2004  to  use  its  veto  if  the  United 
States  and  others  pushed  for  sanctions  against  Sudan  because  of  its 
actions  in  Darfur.  China  subsequently  urged  Sudan  to  be  more  flexi¬ 
ble  in  its  policy  in  Darfur  but  still  opposed  the  use  of  sanctions.  On 
the  other  hand,  China  convinced  Sudan  to  accept  the  UN-AU  hybrid 
peacekeeping  mission.  China  worked  hard  to  establish  cordial  rela¬ 
tions  with  South  Sudan,  where  most  of  the  oil  is  located.  Chinese 
president  Hu  Jintao  visited  Sudan  in  February  2007.  SPFM  president 
Salva  Kiir  visited  China  in  July  2007  to  discuss  China’s  contribution 
to  the  development  of  South  Sudan.  China  had  about  450  military 
personnel  with  UNMIS  in  South  Sudan  and  more  than  300,  mostly

engineers,  assigned  to  UNAMID  in  Darfur.  China  opened  a  consul¬ 
ate  in  Juba  and  was  financing  development  projects  in  South  Sudan. 

Following  Sudanese  independence,  the  Soviet  Union  established 
close  relations  with  Sudan.  The  situation  became  more  complicated 
when  the  Sudan  Communist  Party  was  implicated  in  coup  attempts 
and  Islamists  began  to  assert  authority  in  Sudan.  The  two  countries 
ended  military  cooperation  in  1971;  it  resumed  in  1995,  when  a  visit¬ 
ing  Russian  deputy  foreign  minister  described  relations  between  Sudan 
and  Russia  “as  being  below  the  required  level.”  Russia  supported  UN 
Security  Council  Resolution  1044  in  1996,  which  called  on  Sudan  to 
extradite  three  persons  believed  to  have  been  involved  in  the  assassina¬ 
tion  attempt  against  President  Mubarak  during  a  visit  to  Addis  Ababa 
the  previous  year.  Two  years  later,  however,  Russia  expressed  “serious 
worries”  about  the  American  cruise  missile  attack  on  a  pharmaceutical 
factory  in  Khartoum.  Russia  tended  to  be  supportive  of  Sudan  on 
issues  that  came  before  the  UN  Security  Council.  In  2010  President 
Dmitry  Medvedev  infonned  al-Bashir  that  Russia  had  agreed  to  write 
off  Sudan’s  debt. 

Russia  became  Sudan’s  biggest  arms  supplier.  Sudan  purchased 
tanks  and  artillery  from  Russia  in  2000  and  signed  a  deal  for  12  MiG- 
29  Fulcrum  fighters  a  year  later.  Russia  delivered  all  of  the  aircraft 
before  the  end  of  2004.  Russia  also  gave  Sudan  the  right  to  produce 
Russian  battle  tanks  and  sold  it  Mi-24  Hind  attack  helicopters.  A  Rus¬ 
sian  company  in  2004  won  the  contract  to  build  a  368-kilometer  pipe¬ 
line  in  the  Melut  basin  in  southeast  Sudan.  The  two  countries  also 
agreed  on  a  number  of  joint  projects  in  Sudan  in  the  fields  of  mining, 
petroleum,  electricity,  and  irrigation.  Russia  continued  to  oppose  UN 
sanctions  on  Sudan  in  connection  with  the  Darfur  crisis,  arguing  that  it 
should  be  resolved  exclusively  by  political  means  while  maintaining 
Sudan’s  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.  Russia  had  about  150  mil¬ 
itary  personnel  assigned  to  UNMIS.  Russia  agreed  in  2010  to  sell  Mi- 
17  transport  helicopters  to  South  Sudan. 

Except  for  the  150-year-old  presence  of  about  2,000  Gujarati  traders, 
India  was  not  a  particularly  important  partner  until  2003,  when  its 
national  oil  company,  Oil  and  National  Gas  Corporation  (ONGC), 
acquired  a  25  percent  share  in  Sudan’s  Greater  Nile  Petroleum  Operat¬ 
ing  Company  at  a  cost  of  US$650  million.  The  overseas  investment  ann 
of  ONGC  bought  out  Canada’s  Talisman  Energy,  which  left  Sudan  as  a 
result  of  criticism  from  human-rights  groups  and  pressure  from  the  gov¬ 
ernment  of  Canada.  Indian  investment  in  the  oil  sector  was  about  US$1 
billion  and  expected  to  rise.  This  engagement  also  led  to  economic 
cooperation  in  other  fields.  The  Export-Import  Bank  of  India  extended 
a  US$50  million  line  of  credit  to  Sudan  in  2004.  ONGC  signed  a  con-

tract  in  2004  to  build  a  745-kilometer  pipeline  to  carry  petroleum  deriv¬ 
atives  from  the  Khartoum  refinery  to  a  new  port  on  the  Red  Sea.  India 
was  scheduled  to  build  part  of  a  new  railroad  to  Port  Sudan.  It  was  also 
in  discussion  with  Sudan  on  training  for  the  army,  navy,  and  air  force 
and  on  collaboration  in  the  media  and  entertainment  sector.  India  pro¬ 
vided  about  2,700  military  personnel  to  UNMIS  as  of  early  2011. 

Malaysia  was  the  second-largest  shareholder  in  Sudan’s  oil  industry 
after  China  in  the  early  2000s.  Its  state-owned  oil  company,  PETRO- 
NAS,  had  a  30-percent  share  of  Sudan’s  Greater  Nile  Petroleum  Oper¬ 
ating  Company.  Oil  remained  Malaysia’s  primary  interest  in  Sudan, 
although  during  an  April  2007  visit  to  Sudan,  Malaysia’s  prime  minis¬ 
ter  expressed  a  willingness  to  expand  bilateral  relations  beyond  oil  and 
gas.  He  also  supported  Sudan’s  policy  in  Darfur.  Malaysia  assisted 
with  the  resettlement  of  Darfur  refugees  and  provided  scholarships  for 
Sudanese  students  to  study  oil  and  gas  at  Universiti  Teknologi  Petro- 
nas.  Malaysia  had  fewer  than  10  personnel  assigned  to  UNMIS  and 
more  than  60  with  UNAMID. 

European  Union,  Britain,  and  France 

The  European  Union  (EU)  served  as  an  important  barometer  of 
Western  political  views  toward  Sudan’s  policies  and  sometimes  offset 
more  critical  American  positions.  The  EU,  for  example,  tended  to  be 
more  understanding  of  the  problems  facing  Sudan  in  resolving  the  cri¬ 
sis  in  Darfur.  It  also  declined,  unlike  the  United  States,  to  call  the  kill¬ 
ings  in  Darfur  genocide.  It  engaged  in  constructive  engagement  with 
Sudan  and  was  reluctant  to  impose  sanctions,  but  it  was  willing  to 
decrease  or  stop  development  aid  in  response  to  Khartoum’s  crack¬ 
downs  and  had  imposed  an  arms  embargo.  The  EU’s  principal  concern 
in  Sudan  was  humanitarian  assistance,  help  with  conflict  resolution, 
and  implementation  of  the  CPA.  Formerly,  the  EU  collectively  was  the 
largest  destination  for  Sudanese  exports,  mainly  gold  and  gum  arabic, 
but  since  at  least  2000  Chinese  and  Japanese  imports  of  petroleum 
from  Sudan  had  surpassed  the  value  of  imports  by  the  EU.  Many  EU 
countries  had  small  numbers  of  military  personnel  assigned  to  UNMIS. 

Although  New  Year’s  Day  1956  marked  Sudan’s  independence,  the 
British  actually  transferred  power  in  1954.  Sudan  set  out  almost  imme¬ 
diately  to  broaden  its  relations  with  Arab  and  African  states  and  then 
the  Soviet  Union,  China,  Eastern  Europe,  and  Yugoslavia.  Britain  con¬ 
tinued  to  provide  considerable  assistance,  including  military  aid.  As  the 
civil  war  in  the  South  grew  in  intensity,  Sudan  routinely  blamed  “evil 
colonial  policies”  as  one  of  the  causes.  Relations  with  Britain  decreased 
in  importance  as  those  with  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  increased. 
Sudan  broke  relations  with  Britain  in  1965  over  Britain’s  handling  of 


291 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


the  unilateral  declaration  of  independence  by  Southern  Rhodesia  (now 
Zimbabwe).  Khartoum  restored  ties  a  year  later  but  then  severed  them 
again  in  1967  because  of  the  Six-Day  War  between  Israel  and  neigh¬ 
boring  states.  Relations  resumed  again  a  year  later.  Sudan  alleged  that 
Britain  was  linked  to  a  failed  coup  attempt  in  1976.  By  the  late  1970s, 
the  United  States  had  replaced  Britain  as  the  predominant  Western 
influence  in  Khartoum,  a  situation  that  continued  until  the  overthrow  of 
the  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  government  in  1989.  Britain  remained  important 
for  historical  reasons  and  retained  strong  trade  links.  Together  with  the 
United  States  and  Norway,  Britain  strongly  supported  the  IGAD  peace 
process  that  resulted  in  an  end  to  conflict  between  Khartoum  and  the 
SPLM/A.  British  prime  minister  Tony  Blair  visited  Khartoum  in  Octo¬ 
ber  2004  but  took  a  more  critical  position  on  Sudan’s  policy  in  Darfur 
as  the  crisis  dragged  on.  Of  all  EU  members,  the  British  position  on 
Darfur  was  the  closest  to  that  of  the  United  States. 

France  has  had  a  long  history  as  one  of  Sudan’s  principal  commercial 
partners.  A  French  company  was  one  of  the  prime  contractors  on  the  ill- 
fated  Jonglei  Canal  (see  Glossary).  In  the  early  1980s,  Sudan  awarded  a 
concession  to  the  French  oil  company,  TotalFinaElf,  for  development  of 
the  oil  reserves  in  Block  Five  in  South  Sudan.  Although  the  company 
stopped  work  there  following  the  resumption  of  civil  war,  it  retained  the 
concession  and  initiated  steps  in  2004  to  return.  France  also  sided  with 
Khartoum  in  2004  when  it  asserted  that  the  situation  in  Darfur  should 
not  be  described  as  genocide.  Chad,  a  former  French  colony  and  in 
recent  years  a  country  with  which  it  had  close  relations,  tended  to  influ¬ 
ence  France’s  view  of  the  situation  in  Darfur.  French  policy  on  Darfur 
became  more  critical  following  the  election  in  2007  of  President  Nicolas 
Sarkozy.  France  hosted  in  June  2007  the  United  States,  China,  and  some 
15  other  countries  at  a  major  conference  intended  to  launch  a  new  inter¬ 
national  effort  to  end  the  atrocities  in  Darfur.  Khartoum,  angry  that  it 
was  not  consulted,  boycotted  the  conference.  In  recent  years,  France  has 
shown  less  interest  in  Sudan  while  its  policy  seemed  to  depend  on  which 
official  was  speaking.  French  oil  companies  have  a  continuing  interest 
in  the  development  of  oil  in  South  Sudan. 

United  States 

The  United  States  went  from  an  unusually  important  and  close  rela¬ 
tionship  with  Sudan  in  the  early  1980s  to  one  that  began  to  deteriorate 
near  the  end  of  the  al-Numayri  government  and  then  declined  quickly 
following  the  1 989  military  coup  and  the  rise  of  Islamist  leaders  in 
Sudan’s  government.  Sudanese  support  for  Iraq  during  the  1990-91 
Gulf  War  helped  ensure  the  downturn.  The  United  States,  pushed  by 
domestic  interest  groups  such  as  evangelical  Christians  and  the  Con- 


292 


Government  and  Politics 


gressional  Black  Caucus,  expressed  outspoken  unhappiness  over  Khar¬ 
toum’s  handling  of  the  war  with  the  SPLM/A,  the  human-rights 
situation,  including  alleged  government  support  for  slavery,  and  its  wel¬ 
coming  environment  toward  international  terrorist  groups.  Washington 
put  Sudan  on  its  list  of  state  supporters  of  terrorism  in  1993,  an  action 
that  resulted  in  additional  U.S.  sanctions  against  Sudan. 

The  administration  of  President  William  J.  Clinton  subsequently 
worked  to  isolate  Sudan.  During  the  mid-1990s,  it  instituted  a  Front 
Line  States  policy  of  pressure  against  Khartoum  with  the  assistance  of 
Uganda,  Ethiopia,  and  Eritrea.  Growing  unhappiness  over  Sudan’s  pol¬ 
icies  and  terrorist  threat  information  aimed  at  Americans  in  Sudan, 
much  of  which  turned  out  to  be  false,  caused  the  United  States  in  the 
spring  of  1 996  to  relocate  all  Americans  from  the  embassy  in  Khartoum 
to  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Nairobi.  The  embassy  in  Khartoum  remained 
open  but  staffed  by  Sudanese  and  occasional  Americans  visiting  from 
Kenya.  At  the  urging  of  the  United  States,  Sudan  forced  Osama  bin 
Laden  to  leave  the  country  in  May  of  1 996,  but  Washington  did  not  fol¬ 
low  this  development  by  trying  to  improve  ties  with  Sudan.  The  low 
point  in  relations  occurred  in  August  1998,  just  days  after  the  bombing 
of  the  American  embassies  in  Dar  es  Salaam,  Tanzania,  and  Nairobi, 
when  a  U.S.  naval  vessel  launched  cruise  missiles  against  a  pharmaceu¬ 
tical  factory  in  Khartoum  on  the  questionable  grounds  that  it  was  linked 
to  the  production  of  chemical  weapons. 

At  the  end  of  the  Clinton  administration,  the  United  States  opened  a 
dialogue  with  Sudan  on  counterterrorism,  and  Sudan  was  receptive. 
The  George  W.  Bush  administration  generally  continued  a  tough  policy 
toward  Sudan,  but  the  events  of  September  11,  2001,  had  a  dramatic 
impact  on  the  relationship.  The  United  States  moved  counterterrorism 
to  the  highest  foreign-policy  priority,  and  Sudan,  taking  advantage  of 
this  new  situation,  stepped  up  its  counterterrorism  cooperation  with  the 
United  States.  President  Bush  nominated  former  Senator  John  Dan- 
forth  as  his  special  envoy  for  Sudan  in  2001.  Danforth  focused  on  end¬ 
ing  the  Sudanese  civil  war,  but  the  U.S.  Congress  and  the  evangelical 
community  remained  highly  critical  of  Sudan.  The  United  States  pur¬ 
sued  a  policy  of  carrots  and  sticks.  In  October  2002,  President  Bush 
signed  the  congressionally  initiated  Sudan  Peace  Act,  which  provided 
for  punitive  financial  and  diplomatic  steps  against  Sudan  if  Washing¬ 
ton  concluded  that  Khartoum  was  acting  in  bad  faith  at  the  peace  talks. 
At  the  same  time,  Sudan  offered  significant  cooperation  on  counterter¬ 
rorism,  a  response  appreciated  in  Washington. 

The  United  States,  working  with  IGAD,  Britain,  and  Norway,  played 
a  key  role  in  bringing  the  civil  war  in  Sudan  to  an  end.  While  this  devel¬ 
opment  had  the  potential  to  significantly  improve  Sudanese-American 
relations,  Sudan’s  botched  handling  of  the  crisis  in  Darfur  that  began  in 


293 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


2003  set  back  relations  with  Washington.  In  2006,  under  pressure  from 
Congress  and  domestic  interest  groups,  the  Bush  administration  named 
another  special  envoy  for  Sudan,  Andrew  Natsios,  who  resigned  at  the 
end  of  2007  and  was  replaced  by  former  diplomat  Richard  Williamson. 
The  United  States  took  the  lead  in  requesting  the  UN  Security  Council 
to  impose  additional  international  sanctions  against  Sudan.  Failing  to 
convince  the  UN  to  institute  broader  sanctions,  President  Bush  signed  a 
bill  at  the  end  of  2007  that  allowed  state  and  local  governments  to  cut 
investment  ties  with  companies  doing  business  with  Sudan.  At  the  same 
time,  the  United  States  committed  US$2.7  billion  in  fiscal  years  2005-6 
for  humanitarian  assistance,  peacekeeping  in  Darfur,  implementation  of 
the  CPA,  and  reconstmction  and  development  in  South  Sudan.  Khar¬ 
toum  continued  to  cooperate  with  the  United  States  on  counterterror¬ 
ism.  The  United  States  also  was  the  single  largest  holder — in  the 
amount  of  US$1.5  billion— of  Sudanese  debt.  The  United  States  sup¬ 
ported  full  implementation  of  the  CPA  and  the  Darfur  Peace  Agreement 
and  rapid  deployment  of  more  than  20,000  additional  peacekeepers  to 
Darfur. 

The  situation  in  Darfur  dominated  the  United  States-Sudan  relation¬ 
ship  until  early  in  the  administration  of  President  Barack  H.  Obama. 
Obama  named  Scott  Gration  as  the  new  special  envoy  for  Sudan.  He 
changed  the  tone  of  the  dialogue  with  the  government  in  Khartoum  and 
began  contact  with  Darfur’s  highly  fragmented  rebel  movements.  He 
also  concluded  that  the  United  States  must  give  at  least  as  much  attention 
to  successful  implementation  of  the  CPA  as  to  resolution  of  the  crisis  in 
Darfur.  He  favored  engagement  with  Khartoum  over  confrontation  and 
proposed  a  policy  of  engagement  that  included  rewards  and  penalties. 
Gration’s  policy  had  support  in  the  White  House  but  detractors  else¬ 
where  in  the  U.S.  government  and  some  harsh  critics  on  Capitol  Hill  and 
in  the  “Save  Darfur  Coalition”  community.  Late  in  2010,  the  United 
States  spelled  out  the  conditions  for  the  normalization  of  ties  with  Sudan. 
They  included  full  implementation  of  the  CPA  and  the  holding  of  a  refer¬ 
endum  on  the  future  of  South  Sudan  in  January  2011.  The  United  States 
significantly  increased  the  number  of  personnel  devoted  to  an  effort  to 
assure  this  outcome.  Washington  also  noted  that  there  must  be  peace  and 
accountability  in  Darfur. 

United  Nations 

Sudan  joined  the  United  Nations  in  1956,  and  its  various  institutions 
began  almost  immediately  to  assist  Sudan.  UN  refugee  assistance  during 
Sudan’s  first  civil  war  began  in  the  early  1960s.  In  1965  one  of  the  South 
Sudanese  exile  organizations  unsuccessfully  demanded  the  intervention  of 
the  United  Nations  to  end  atrocities.  Sudan  experienced  frequent  criticism

in  UN  bodies  throughout  the  first  civil  war  that  ended  in  1972.  Khartoum 
showed  great  skill  in  using  the  United  Nations  in  pursuit  of  its  own  inter¬ 
ests.  One  example  occurred  in  1976,  when  Sudan  accused  Libya  at  the 
United  Nations  of  supporting  a  failed  coup  attempt. 

Because  the  country  was  engaged  continuously  in  a  civil  war  in  the 
South  until  2005  except  for  the  period  1972-83,  Sudan  was  the  subject  of 
many  UN  resolutions.  The  United  Nations  Children’s  Fund  (UNICEF) 
and  the  World  Food  Programme  created  Operation  Lifeline  Sudan  in 
1989  to  deal  with  the  problems  created  in  the  South  by  drought  and  the 
civil  war.  The  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights 
issued  a  series  of  reports  critical  of  the  human-rights  situation  in  Sudan. 
The  Security  Council  imposed  sanctions  on  Sudan  in  May  1996  after 
Khartoum  refused  to  extradite  three  Egyptians  to  Ethiopia  for  their 
alleged  involvement  in  the  attempted  assassination  of  President  Mubarak 
in  Addis  Ababa  in  1995.  The  mild  sanctions  reduced  the  number  and 
level  of  Sudanese  diplomats  stationed  abroad.  The  Security  Council,  with 
the  United  States  abstaining,  removed  these  sanctions  in  August  2001.  In 
2005,  the  UN  Security  Council  agreed  to  a  travel  ban  and  asset  freeze  on 
persons  suspected  of  committing  human-rights  abuses  in  Darfur  and  in 
2006  imposed  sanctions  against  four  Sudanese  involved  in  Darfur  atroci¬ 
ties.  Much  to  the  consternation  of  the  United  States,  Sudan  in  2004  filled 
an  African  regional  seat  on  the  United  Nations  Human  Rights  Commis¬ 
sion.  A  UN  commission  investigating  atrocities  in  Darfur  concluded  in 
2005  that  genocide  had  not  occurred.  It  did  find,  however,  that  Khartoum 
and  government-sponsored  militias  engaged  in  “widespread  and  system¬ 
atic”  abuse  that  might  constitute  crimes  against  humanity.  By  late  2010,

the  UN  had  two  of  its  largest  peacekeeping  operations — UNMIS  and 
UNAMID— in  Sudan. 

Outlook 

In  early  2011,  Sudan  confronted  two  major  domestic  issues:  full 
implementation  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  and  an  end  to 
the  violence  in  Darfur.  Full  implementation  of  the  CPA  would  determine 
the  future  of  Sudan’s  North-South  relationship,  with  the  South  having 
opted  for  independence.  Because  South  Sudan,  which  had  most  of  the 
country’s  oil,  chose  independence,  as  was  anticipated,  Khartoum  had  to 
try  to  work  out  a  revenue-sharing  arrangement  that  would  give  it  access 
to  oil  and  the  associated  profits  for  years  to  come.  If  it  failed  to  achieve 
this  goal,  a  return  to  North-South  violence  was  highly  likely.  Khartoum 
controlled  the  only  pipeline  capable  of  exporting  oil  to  the  international 
market.  Although  22  years  of  conflict  in  South  Sudan  came  to  an  end  in 
2005,  treacherous  days  clearly  lay  ahead,  as  there  would  be  considerable 
pressure  from  Northerners  and  Southerners  alike  to  undermine  the 
remaining  provisions  of  the  CPA. 

In  addition  to  the  secession  of  the  South,  another  urgent  issue  was 
the  proposed  referendum  by  the  citizens  of  Abyei,  an  enclave  adminis¬ 
tered  since  2005  by  the  Northern  state  of  South  Kordofan  but  histori¬ 
cally  linked  to  South  Sudan,  whereby  they  would  decide  whether  or 
not  to  return  to  South  Sudanese  administration.  This  was  an  important 
issue  because  considerable  oil  is  located  in  this  region.  Popular  consul¬ 
tations  to  determine  the  future  of  South  Kordofan  and  Blue  Nile  were 
also  needed. 

Only  a  complete  commitment  to  the  CPA  process  by  both  the 
SPLM  and  the  NCP  and  the  goodwill  of  an  overwhelming  majority  of 
Sudanese  of  all  political  persuasions  would  enable  the  country  to 
escape  renewed  civil  war.  The  referendum  vote  for  the  independence 
of  South  Sudan  could  only  have  been  avoided  if  the  national  govern¬ 
ment  had  recognized  and  accepted  the  diversity  of  the  Sudanese  people 
and  shared  both  power  and  wealth  with  all  parts  of  the  country  on  an 
equitable  basis.  It  also  depended  on  the  willingness  of  Southerners  to 
at  least  consider  the  possibility  of  unity.  Neither  of  these  developments 
occurred,  with  the  consequence  that  the  South  was  about  to  become  a 
separate,  independent  entity. 

In  the  meantime,  the  situation  in  Darfur  cried  out  for  compromise  by 
both  Khartoum  and  the  numerous  rebel  groups,  so  that  there  could  be  a 
political  settlement.  Residents  of  Darfur  had  also  to  decide  if  they 
wanted  to  unify  the  three  Darfur  states  and  reconstitute  the  Darfur 
region  that  existed  in  the  1980s.  The  Darfur  Peace  Agreement  promised 
a  referendum  on  this  issue  by  July  2010,  a  deadline  that  was  missed.  It 


296 


Government  and  Politics 


was  also  important  not  to  lose  sight  of  successful  implementation  of  the 
peace  agreement  in  Eastern  Sudan.  If  handled  equitably  and  transpar¬ 
ently,  Sudan’s  new  oil  wealth  could  help  resolve  all  of  these  problems. 
The  challenges  for  Sudan’s  external  relations  were  considerable  as 
well,  although  there  have  been  improvements  in  recent  years  in  spite  of 
the  fact  that  the  International  Criminal  Court  indictment  of  al-Bashir 
significantly  complicated  Sudan’s  situation.  Clearly,  the  Sudanese  gov¬ 
ernment  and  people  confronted  huge  challenges  in  early  2011  and 
would  continue  to  do  so  in  the  foreseeable  future.

Chapter  5.  National  Security 


Sudan  s  national  emblem,  a  prominent  symbol  in  military  insignia 


SUDAN  OCCUPIES  A  STRATEGICALLY  SENSITIVE  AREA  in  the 
Horn  of  Africa.  The  nation's  military,  developed  during  the  British  colo¬ 
nial  era,  has  remained  influential  in  independent  Sudan.  Domestic  secu¬ 
rity  problems  have  been  the  main  sources  of  national  defense  concern. 
As  of  early  2008,  Sudan  was  involved  in  ethnic  strife  on  the  Chad  border, 
but  the  situation  and  relations  with  Chad  had  greatly  improved  by  201 1 . 

Divisions  based  on  culture  and  history  between  the  Arab-dominated 
Muslim  North  and  the  African,  non-Muslim  South  caused  a  17-year 
civil  war  that  ended  in  1972.  The  war  resumed  in  1983  after  President 
Ja’far  al-Numayri  abrogated  the  peace  accord  by  redividing  the  South 
into  three  regions  and  imposing  sharia  law  on  the  country.  Major  South¬ 
ern  ethnic  groups  such  as  the  Dinka,  Nuer,  and  Shilluk  formed  the  back¬ 
bone  of  the  revolt.  Many  of  these  Southern  groups  also  fought  among 
themselves.  For  more  than  two  decades,  the  Sudan  People's  Liberation 
Movement/ Army  (SPLM/A)  and  several  other  Southern  rebel  groups 
battled  government  forces,  until  the  two  sides  signed  the  Comprehensive 
Peace  Agreement  (CPA)  in  January  2005  after  several  years  of  torturous 
negotiations. 

Conflict  also  plagued  Darfur,  South  Kordofan  and  Blue  Nile,  and  north¬ 
east  Sudan  in  the  1990s  and  early  2000s.  Aside  from  its  regular  forces,  the 
government  frequently  used  militias  against  its  opponents.  These  militias 
often  committed  human-rights  violations  and  exacerbated  local  intercom- 
munal  wars.  As  a  result,  millions  fled  their  homes  to  escape  the  fighting 
and  avert  starvation. 

Sudan’s  growing  instability  notwithstanding,  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces 
(SAF)  remained  the  most  stable  institution  in  a  country  beset  by  an  array 
of  political,  economic,  and  social  problems.  However,  throughout  the 
period  since  1989,  the  SAF  itself  has  experienced  varying  degrees  of  eth¬ 
nic  and  religious  dissension. 

Many  Sudanese  accept  the  SAF  as  the  state’s  guardian  nevertheless, 
especially  when  confidence  in  politicians  falters.  In  1985,  for  example,  a 
group  of  SAF  officers  deposed  al-Numayri.  Then,  in  1989,  some  mid¬ 
level  officers,  led  by  Colonel  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al-Bashir,  seized 
power  and  dissolved  the  successor  civilian  parliamentary  government 
(1986—89).  The  new  government  aligned  itself  with  the  National  Islamic 
Front  (NIF),  an  Islamist  party.  The  military  clique  purged  the  SAF  of 
potential  dissenters,  arrested  suspected  opponents,  and  introduced  harsh 
internal  security  controls. 

During  the  1990s,  Hassan  Abdallah  al-Turabi,  an  Islamist  ideologue, 
helped  create  a  religiously  oriented  politico-military  militia  called  the 


301 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Popular  Defense  Forces  (PDF)  that  eventually  was  supposed  to  replace 
the  SAF  but  never  did.  Poor  economic  conditions  made  Sudan  depen¬ 
dent  on  foreign  aid  to  equip  and  maintain  the  SAF. 

Many  SAF  troops  fought  in  Southern  Sudan  against  the  SPLM/A  and 
other  ethnically  based  Southern  rebel  groups  that  sought  a  voice  in  the 
affairs  of  their  country.  Low  morale  and  shortages  of  weapons  and  sup¬ 
plies  eroded  their  capabilities.  During  the  civil  war  in  the  South,  much  of 
the  SAF’s  equipment  was  not  serviceable  because  of  poor  maintenance 
and  lack  of  spare  parts.  Problems  such  as  these  were  at  least  partially 
remedied  after  the  late  1990s  when  funds  from  the  sale  of  oil  became 
available. 

The  SAF,  numbering  more  than  109,000  in  201 1,  was  responsible  for 
maintaining  internal  and  external  security  until  the  signing  of  the  CPA, 
which  provided  for  the  Government  of  Southern  Sudan  (GOSS)  to 
assume  security  responsibilities  in  the  South.  Beginning  in  2003  and  con¬ 
tinually  thereafter,  the  Darfur  war  posed  a  politico-military  challenge  to 
the  al-Bashir  government  as  the  international  community  escalated  criti¬ 
cism  of  Khartoum’s  harsh  military  strategy  in  that  region.  Despite  internal 
problems  and  international  pressure,  al-Bashir  remained  firmly  in  control 
of  the  government  and  Sudan’s  armed  forces. 

The  Military  in  National  Life 

The  warrior  tradition  was  an  important  aspect  of  Sudan’s  history,  and 
military  involvement  in  government  continued  in  modem  Sudan. 
Although  Sudan  inherited  a  parliamentary  form  of  government  from 
Britain,  the  Sudanese  had  become  accustomed  to  a  colonial  system  that 
was  inherently  military  in  nature.  British  military  officers  held  senior 
administrative  positions  in  both  the  provincial  and  central  governments. 
At  independence,  Sudan  faced  difficult  economic,  political,  and  social 
problems  that  few  believed  could  be  solved  by  untested  parliamentary 
mle  in  a  country  fragmented  by  competing  ethnic,  religious,  and  regional 
interests.  It  seemed  natural  to  turn  to  a  national  institution  like  the  army 
that  could  address  these  problems  through  a  system  of  centralized 
enforcement  and  control.  Such  was  the  course  of  Sudanese  national  life 
after  independence. 

Early  Development  of  the  Armed  Forces 

Muhammad  Ali  Pasha,  the  viceroy  of  Egypt,  conquered  Sudan  in 
1 82 1 .  He  created  a  Sudanese  military  to  help  establish  an  Egyptian  empire 
independent  of  the  Ottoman  sultan.  Muhammad  Ali  also  authorized  the 
army  to  undertake  slave  raids  in  the  South  and  the  Nuba  Mountains  that 
allowed  Egypt  to  import  some  10,000  slaves  annually.  During  1822-23, 


302 


National  Security 


the  army  impressed  some  30,000  males  for  military  service.  In  1 863-67, 
an  under-strength  Egyptian-Sudanese  conscript  battalion  (446  officers  and 
men)  served  with  the  French  army  in  Mexico. 

Britain  occupied  Egypt  in  1882,  disbanded  the  Egyptian  military,  and 
created  a  new  Sudan  army.  In  1 896  Britain  used  about  8,000  Sudanese 
troops  against  the  Khalifa,  the  military  leader  who  succeeded  the  famed 
Mahdi  (see  Glossary;  The  Maddiyyah,  1885-98,  eh.  1).  There  were  seven 
Sudanese  battalions  by  1 898  that  the  British  deployed  to  maintain  internal 
security  throughout  Sudan.  Over  the  next  decade,  Sudanese  soldiers  par¬ 
ticipated  in  punitive  expeditions  against  Muhammad  al-Amin,  a  Moroc¬ 
can  mystic,  in  the  Nuba  Mountains  in  1903,  and  against  the  rebel  Abd  al- 
Qadir  Wad  Habuba  in  what  was  then  Blue  Nile  Province  in  1908. 

World  War  I 

During  the  period  of  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium  ( 1 899— 
1955),  British  officials  developed  a  policy  of  administrative  separation 
of  the  Muslim-dominated  Northern  Sudan  from  the  mostly  non-Mus¬ 
lim  South.  Participation  of  Southerners  in  Northern  units  of  the  Suda¬ 
nese  armed  forces  was  all  but  eliminated.  Sudanese  troops  in  the  North 
were  commanded  largely  by  British  and  Egyptian  commissioned  offi¬ 
cers  until  an  anti-British  mutiny  in  1924  caused  Egyptian  troops  and 
commanders  to  be  sent  home. 

Sudan’s  military  strength  at  the  outbreak  of  World  War  I  included 
14,000-15,000  troops  organized  into  four  companies  of  British  territorials 
and  a  British  artilleiy  detachment,  all  of  them  deployed  in  and  around  Khar¬ 
toum.  Egyptian  army  units,  which  manned  46  posts  throughout  Sudan, 
included  12  infantry  battalions,  four  double  companies  of  the  Arab  Battal¬ 
ion,  six  Camel  Corps  companies,  a  cavalry  squadron,  three  mounted  infan¬ 
try  companies,  and  some  artillery.  Additionally,  Sudanese  territorial  units 
manned  posts  throughout  Southern  Sudan.  These  forces  played  no  major 
direct  role  in  World  War  I. 

Despite  Sudanese  reluctance  to  become  involved  in  the  fighting, 
steps  were  taken  to  secure  its  borders.  Two  British  destroyers  patrolled 
the  Red  Sea.  In  1917  Khartoum  established  a  Reserve  Corps  that  all 
British  male  subjects  in  Sudan  had  to  join  (with  exceptions  for  reasons 
of  age,  health,  and  occupation).  However,  the  Reserve  Corps  never  con¬ 
ducted  any  military  operations. 

Sudanese  soldiers  played  a  modest  role  in  World  War  I  by  serving 
with  the  Western  Allies  in  East  Africa.  Sudanese  troops  also  helped 
defend  the  Suez  Canal  from  bases  in  Sinai  and  participated  in  the  Darda¬ 
nelles  and  Palestine  campaigns.  Some  Sudanese  mercenaries,  by  contrast, 
served  with  Gennan  forces  commanded  by  General  Paul  von  Lettow- 
Vorbeck.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Sudan  escaped  the  ravages  of  World  War  I,  although  British  officials 
remained  concerned  about  the  prospects  of  fighting  or  subversion.  There 
were  fears  that  an  Ottoman  call  for  jihad  would  lead  to  a  renewal  of  Mah- 
dist  fervor.  The  authorities  therefore  reconciled  with  Abd  al-Rahman  al- 
Mahdi,  son  of  the  Mahdi,  in  exchange  for  his  declaration  of  loyalty.  In 
September  1914,  Governor-General  Sir  Reginald  Wingate  offered  to 
deploy  up  to  eight  Sudanese  companies  to  Nimule  for  service  in  Uganda 
to  deter  a  German  attack.  Although  the  arrival  in  Uganda  of  reinforce¬ 
ments  from  India  obviated  the  need  for  Sudanese  troops,  some  Sudanese 
detachments  established  positions  east  of  Nimule  to  stop  Didinga  raids 
into  Uganda. 

The  Ottomans  sought  to  gain  control  of  Sudan  by  inflaming  Islamist 
passions  in  Darfur,  thereby  undermining  British  authority.  In  February 
1915,  Turkey’s  minister  of  war,  Enver  Pasha,  dispatched  a  letter  to  Ali 
Dinar,  the  sultan  of  Darfur,  imploring  him  to  declare  war  on  Britain.  Tur¬ 
key’s  Committee  of  Union  and  Progress  also  launched  an  anti-British 
propaganda  campaign  that  caused  dissension  in  the  Sudanese  and  Egyp¬ 
tian  armies.  In  October  1915,  the  leader  of  the  Libyan-based  pro-Turkish 
Senussi  Islamist  movement  hatched  a  scheme  to  encourage  Ali  Dinar  to 
join  a  jihad  against  the  British. 

The  British  responded  to  these  machinations  by  creating  the  Western 
Arab  Corps  in  1916  to  facilitate  the  occupation  of  Darfur  after  Ali  Dinar 
died  in  battle.  Additionally,  they  created  the  Equatoria  Corps  in  Decem¬ 
ber  1917  to  provide  security  in  Southern  Sudan  and  reinforced  the  Camel 
Corps  in  Kordofan  Province.  They  also  established  a  defense  bureau  and 
censored  the  mail  of  German  and  Austrian  citizens  residing  in  Sudan. 

The  Interwar  Period 

During  the  postwar  period,  nationalism  became  a  factor  in  the  armed 
forces.  British  officials  feared  that  Egypt,  where  nationalist  sentiment  was 
rising,  would  encourage  its  soldiers  to  incite  the  Sudanese  to  revolt.  In 
1920  Sir  Alexander  Keown-Boyd,  the  oriental  secretary  to  the  high  com¬ 
missioner  in  Egypt,  suggested  that  Egyptian  units  be  withdrawn  from 
Sudan.  At  about  the  same  time,  an  army  officer,  Abdallah  Khalil,  founded 
the  Sudan  Union  Society.  Three  years  later,  a  Dinka  anny  officer,  Ali  Abd 
al-Latif,  established  the  White  Flag  League  to  imitate  Egypt’s  1919  revo¬ 
lution.  In  mid- 1924,  this  organization  staged  political  demonstrations 
throughout  Sudan.  On  August  9,  anned  cadets  from  the  Military  School 
demonstrated  in  Khartoum,  and  shortly  thereafter,  the  Egyptian  Railway 
Battalion  rebelled  and  carried  out  various  acts  of  sabotage.  The  British 
redeployed  the  Egyptian  Railway  Battalion  back  to  Egypt  in  September, 
after  its  involvement  in  nationalist  demonstrations.  However,  unrest  con¬ 
tinued  in  Shendi,  Al-Obeid,  Blue  Nile  Province,  Dongola,  and  Malakal. 


304 


National  Security 


Governor-General  Sir  Lee  Stack  responded  to  this  unrest  on  August 
19,  1924,  by  proposing  the  immediate  evacuation  of  all  Egyptian  forces. 
However,  on  November  19,  an  Egyptian  nationalist  assassinated  Stack.  A 
week  later,  the  Egyptian  minister  of  war  ordered  his  forces  to  return 
home.  The  following  day,  six  Sudanese  officers  and  two  platoons  of  the 
1 1th  Sudanese  Battalion  mutinied  in  Khartoum,  but  British  forces  quickly 
restored  order.  On  January  17,  1925,  the  British  established  the  Sudan 
Defence  Force  (SDF),  which  included  British  and  Northern  Sudanese 
troops.  Southern  participation  in  the  SDF  was  limited  to  the  Equatoria 
Corps,  which  was  commanded  by  British  officers. 

The  Italian-Ethiopian  War  and  World  War  II 

Sudan  played  a  vital  role  in  Ethiopia’s  liberation  from  Italian  mili¬ 
tary  occupation  and  supported  the  Allied  effort  during  World  War  II. 
Britain  considered  the  October  3,  1935,  Italian  invasion  of  Ethiopia  as  a 
threat  to  its  interests  in  Sudan  and  throughout  East  Africa,  and  not  with¬ 
out  cause.  Italian  military  planners  hoped  to  weaken  British  control  of 
Northern  Sudan  by  attacking  Atbarah,  Khartoum,  and  Port  Sudan.  If  the 
Italians  could  occupy  Atbarah,  a  railway  junction  between  Port  Sudan 
and  Khartoum,  they  would  disrupt  the  transport  of  British  troops  and 
supplies  to  the  capital.  The  capture  of  Port  Sudan  would  give  Italy  a  stra¬ 
tegic  naval  base  for  its  Red  Sea  operations. 

At  the  outbreak  of  the  Italian-Ethiopian  war,  Sudan’s  military 
strength  included  only  some  5,000  troops  organized  into  the  SDF,  includ¬ 
ing  the  Western  Arab  Corps,  Eastern  Arab  Corps,  Equatoria  Corps,  and 
Camel  Corps;  a  few  hundred  police;  and  2,500  British  troops  organized 
into  three  battalions  that  were  stationed  at  Atbarah,  Khartoum,  and  Port 
Sudan.  Italy’s  considerably  larger  military  presence  in  the  region 
included  more  than  1 00,000  troops  with  artillery,  armored  vehicles,  and 
some  200  airplanes. 

However,  British  fears  of  a  large-scale  Italian  invasion  of  Sudan 
proved  to  be  unfounded,  as  the  occupation  of  Ethiopia  had  engaged  the 
majority  of  its  forces.  As  a  result,  Italian  military  forces  only  conducted 
low-level  operations  along  the  Sudan-Ethiopia  frontier.  Further,  by 
1936  Britain  had  reequipped  the  SDF  and  had  increased  its  size  by  cre¬ 
ating  six  armored  mobile  companies  to  protect  Sudan’s  eastern  border. 
Police  units  also  deployed  to  the  frontier,  while  the  Royal  Air  Force 
conducted  antisubmarine  patrols  in  the  Red  Sea;  air  defense  missions 
over  Atbarah,  Khartoum,  and  Port  Sudan;  and  close  support  operations 
for  the  army  and  Ethiopian  resistance  fighters  known  as  the  Patriots. 
The  SDF’s  successes  on  the  eastern  frontier  led  the  British  to  deploy 
SDF  units  to  North  Africa  to  impede  German  advances  toward  Egypt 
and  Libya. 


305 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Well  before  the  defeat  of  Italian  forces  in  mid- 1941,  the  British  had 
begun  to  develop  an  indigenous  officer  class  among  educated  Suda¬ 
nese,  mostly  from  influential  families  in  the  North.  Consequently,  a 
growing  number  of  Sudanese  viewed  the  SDF  as  a  national  organiza¬ 
tion  rather  than  as  an  instrument  of  foreign  control.  Even  so,  in  the 
decade  between  the  end  of  World  War  II  and  Sudan's  independence,  the 
SDF  did  not  grow  significantly  in  size,  but  Sudanese  assumed  increas¬ 
ingly  important  posts  as  British  officers  were  reassigned  or  retired. 
However,  the  South’s  underdeveloped  education  system  produced  few 
qualified  candidates,  as  most  lacked  fluency  in  Arabic,  the  SDF’s  lin¬ 
gua  franca.  The  British  had  hoped  to  use  the  recruitment  of  Southerners 
into  the  SDF  after  World  War  II  to  spur  their  integration  into  Sudanese 
national  life,  but  the  paucity  of  qualified  Southern  candidates  facilitated 
the  Arabization  of  the  armed  forces. 

In  1955  the  SDF's  Equatoria  Coips — composed  primarily  of 
Southern  enlisted  men  but  increasingly  commanded  by  Northerners  as 
the  British  withdrew — mutinied  because  of  resentment  over  Northern 
control  of  national  politics  and  institutions.  Northern  troops  quelled 
the  rebellion,  and  Khartoum  disbanded  the  Equatoria  Corps  after  most 
of  its  men  went  into  hiding  and  began  a  struggle  to  achieve  Southern 
autonomy. 

At  independence  on  January  1,  1956,  Sudan's  5,000-man  army  was  a 
highly  trained,  competent,  and  apolitical  force.  However,  its  character 
gradually  changed  as  it  dealt  with  the  Southern  insurgency.  The  army 
expanded  to  12,000  personnel  in  1959  and  to  about  50,000  by  the  early 
1970s.  The  military — particularly  the  educated  officer  corps — also 
became  increasingly  politicized  as  a  growing  number  of  personnel  asso¬ 
ciated  themselves  with  political  parties  and  movements  across  the  politi¬ 
cal  spectmm. 

Role  in  Government 

Since  independence,  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces  (SAF)  have  over¬ 
thrown  four  civilian  governments  and  imposed  military  rule.  Military 
leaders  introduced  some  stability  but  frequently  restricted  political  activ¬ 
ities.  Many  Sudanese  mistakenly  believed  that  military  rule  would 
dampen  ethnic,  religious,  and  social  squabbling  and  would  improve  the 
economy,  end  the  Southern  civil  war,  and  expand  political  rights.  How¬ 
ever,  the  military  regimes  were  authoritarian  and  proved  incapable  of 
dealing  effectively  with  the  military  and  political  problems  that  plagued 
Sudan  after  independence.  The  al-Bashir  regime  also  fell  into  this  pattern 
for  most  of  its  first  decade  in  power.  Thereafter,  however,  the  country 
witnessed  significant  positive  change,  because  of  the  discovery  and 
export  of  oil  after  1999  and  because  of  a  negotiated  end  to  the  long-run-

concerned  the  Darfur  war  and  its  human-rights  record. 

The  military’s  first  intervention  in  politics  occurred  in  1958,  when 
Major  General  Ibrahim  Abbud  seized  power,  ostensibly  because  the 
civilian  leadership  had  failed  to  resolve  the  country’s  economic,  mili¬ 
tary,  and  political  problems.  It  quickly  became  evident,  however,  that 
Abbud  lacked  the  ability  to  resolve  these  problems.  In  1964  public  frus¬ 
tration  manifested  itself  in  large-scale  antigovemment  demonstrations 
in  Khartoum  that  forced  Abbud  to  step  down. 

The  military  initially  supported  the  civilian  regime  that  replaced 
Abbud,  and  many  senior  military  officers  held  political  appointments  in 
the  government  (see  The  Abbud  Military  Government,  1958-64,  eh.  1). 
Nonetheless,  several  field-grade  officers,  some  of  whom  had  been  linked 
to  Abbud's  ouster,  remained  skeptical  about  the  civilian  government’s 
ability  to  resolve  the  country’s  many  problems.  In  1969  a  group  called 
the  Free  Officers'  Movement  seized  power  and  Ja’far  al-Numayri,  then  a 
colonel,  became  Sudan’s  new  leader. 

The  new  military  government,  known  as  the  Revolutionary  Com¬ 
mand  Council  (RCC)  and  composed  of  nine  young  officers  and  one  civil¬ 
ian,  exercised  authority  from  1969  until  1971  over  a  largely  civilian 
cabinet.  The  RCC,  which  represented  only  a  faction  within  the  military, 
initially  devised  radical  policies  in  cooperation  with  the  Sudanese  com¬ 
munists,  including  nationalization  of  economic  institutions,  escalation  of 
the  Southern  civil  war,  violent  repression  of  the  Ansar  (see  Glossary) 
politico-religious  sect,  and  suppression  of  democratic  institutions.  The 
authorities  arrested  or  sacked  more  than  300  high-ranking  SAF  officers 
who  opposed  these  policies.  After  this  purge,  only  one  general  officer 
remained  in  the  RCC.  Squabbling  in  the  RCC  between  nationalist  offi¬ 
cers  under  al-Numayri  and  leftist-oriented  officers  aligned  with  the  Sudan 
Communist  Party  (SCP)  resulted  in  an  unsuccessful  1971  coup  attempt. 

The  country  was  technically  no  longer  under  armed  forces  governance 
after  the  RCC’s  dissolution  in  late  1971.  Although  al-Numayri ’s  mounting 
prestige  enabled  him  to  broaden  his  support  base,  especially  among  civil¬ 
ians,  during  the  next  decade  the  military  establishment  remained  his  major 
constituency  and  source  of  power.  Many  SAF  officers  served  as  ministers, 
undertook  domestic  and  international  missions,  and  helped  to  establish  the 
country's  sole  political  party,  the  Sudan  Socialist  Union  (SSU).  Defense 
ministers  (who  were  general  officers)  also  became  secretaries-general  of 
the  SSU.  The  National  Security  Council,  whose  membership  was  domi¬ 
nated  by  SAF  officers,  helped  frame  political  and  economic  policies.  The 
largely  powerless  People's  Assembly  had  1 8  seats  reserved  for  anned  ser¬ 
vices  personnel.  Al-Numayri  justified  the  predominance  of  military  per¬ 
sonnel  in  senior  government  positions  by  claiming  that  they  represented 


307

the  country’s  most  disciplined  organization  and  that  they  were  motivated 
by  nationalist  convictions. 

By  the  early  1980s,  al-Numayri  increasingly  acted  as  if  the  SAF  was 
an  instrument  of  his  personal  political  dictates  rather  than  the  source  of 
his  political  power.  The  armed  forces  remained  largely  loyal  to  al- 
Numayri  despite  numerous  coup  attempts,  some  of  which  were  orga¬ 
nized  by  dissatisfied  military  personnel.  Nevertheless,  there  was  a  grad¬ 
ual  deterioration  in  the  relationship  between  al-Numayri  and  the  SAF. 
In  an  extraordinary  move  in  1982,  al-Numayri  retired  General  Abd  al- 
Majid  Hamad  Khalil — vice  president,  minister  of  defense,  SAF  com¬ 
mander  in  chief,  SSU  secretary-general,  and  generally  regarded  as  the 
heir  apparent — along  with  22  other  top-ranking  officers. 

Following  this  purge,  al-Numayri  assumed  command  of  the  SAF 
and  briefly  held  the  defense  portfolio.  In  response  to  al-Numayri ’s  cen¬ 
trist  and  Islamist  policies.  Southern  troops  mutinied,  and  civil  war 
resumed  in  1983.  This  conflict,  coupled  with  the  country’s  poor  econ¬ 
omy,  eroded  al-Numayri's  popularity.  The  armed  forces  were  of  little 
help  as  resistance  to  al-Numayri ’s  policies  precipitated  demonstrations 
and  strikes. 

On  April  6,  1985,  Minister  of  Defense  Lieutenant  General  Abd  al- 
Rahman  Siwar  al-Dhahab  deposed  al-Numayri  in  a  bloodless  coup. 
Al-Dahab  established  a  15-man  Transitional  Military  Council  (TMC) 
to  govern  the  country  for  a  one-year  period,  after  which  civilian  rule 
was  to  be  restored.  The  TMC  honored  this  commitment;  elections 
were  held,  and  a  civilian  government  took  office  in  April  1986. 

Prime  Minister  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  presided  over  a  series  of  coalition 
governments  from  1986  to  1989.  His  relations  with  the  armed  forces 
were  often  stormy,  largely  because  of  the  ongoing  Southern  rebellion.  In 
September  1986,  he  forcibly  retired  the  SAF  commander  in  chief  and 
the  chief  of  the  general  staff  along  with  about  20  other  officers.  In  Feb¬ 
ruary  1989,  the  SAF  leadership  demanded  that  Sadiq  pursue  the  South¬ 
ern  war  more  vigorously  or  opt  for  a  peace  settlement,  but  he  did  neither. 

The  result  was  that  on  June  30, 1989,  Colonel  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al- 
Bashir,  a  paratroop  officer  who  had  served  in  the  South,  overthrew  the 
Sadiq  government.  A  Revolutionary  Command  Council  for  National  Sal¬ 
vation  (RCC-NS),  consisting  of  15  SAF  officers  led  by  al-Bashir,  justified 
the  coup  by  citing  the  Sadiq  government’s  neglect  of  the  anned  forces  and 
its  failure  to  resolve  the  country’s  economic  problems  and  to  reestablish 
security  in  the  South.  Al-Bashir,  who  eventually  became  Sudan’s  longest- 
serving  president,  was  head  of  state,  prime  minister,  and  minister  of 
defense  in  the  new  government.  The  RCC-NS  vice  chairman,  a  brigadier 
general,  became  deputy  prime  minister.  Other  senior  SAF  officers  served 
as  minister  of  interior,  minister  of  justice,  and  attorney  general.

National  Security 


Most  Sudanese  welcomed  the  establishment  of  al-Bashir ’s  govern¬ 
ment  in  hopes  that  it  would  end  political  turbulence,  improve  the  econ¬ 
omy,  and  end  the  Southern  civil  war.  The  Muslim  Brotherhood  and  the 
NIF  supported  it.  Like  past  military  officers,  al-Bashir  justified  the  coup 
and  his  policies  as  the  only  alternative  to  civilian  mismanagement.  To 
secure  its  control,  the  regime  suppressed  political  activities,  treated  its 
opponents  harshly,  and  sacked  or  retired  the  army  commander,  27  other 
generals,  and  some  500  other  officers.  In  April  1990,  the  government 
executed  28  officers,  including  senior  officers  removed  by  the  junta, 
ostensibly  to  prevent  a  coup  against  the  regime.  Its  ruthless  suppression 
of  discontent  frightened  the  internal  opposition  into  silence.  At  the  same 
time,  military  purges  left  the  majority  of  active-duty  officers  silent  for 
fear  of  being  dismissed,  jailed,  or  shot.  Infiltration  of  informers  into  the 
SAF  made  dissident  activity  risky. 

During  the  next  two  decades,  al-Bashir  successfully  marginalized 
individuals  or  groups  suspected  of  disloyalty  to  the  regime.  Nonetheless, 
the  armed  forces  continued  to  be  involved  in  coup  attempts  against  the 
government.  In  April  1991,  the  security  forces  executed  20  SAF  officers 
for  their  involvement  in  a  coup  attempt  and  sacked  Minister  of  Interior 
Faisal  Abu  Salih  and  Brigadier  General  Uthman  Ahmad  Hassan.  The 
following  August,  the  police  arrested  10  SAF  officers  and  several  civil¬ 
ians  for  a  coup  attempt  ascribed  to  “foreign  powers.”  A  military  court 
sentenced  the  1 0  officers  to  death,  but  their  sentences  were  commuted  to 
life  imprisonment. 

Another  attempted  coup  occurred  in  March  1996,  this  one  during  a 
period  when  the  government  was  trying  to  convince  the  population  that 
Sudan  had  entered  a  period  of  “stability  and  reconciliation.”  In  August 
1996,  Egyptian-based  Sudanese  opponents  of  the  al-Bashir  regime 
reported  that  1 1  SAF  officers  had  been  executed  for  participating  in  a  con¬ 
spiracy  to  occupy  government  facilities  in  Port  Sudan,  although  the  gov¬ 
ernment  denied  that  executions  had  taken  place.  Beginning  in  late  1999, 
al-Bashir  faced  a  clear  challenge  to  his  authority  from  Hassan  al-Turabi,  a 
former  ally  in  the  NIF,  and  his  sympathizers,  some  of  them  in  the  armed 
forces  and  militia  groups  (see  The  Al-Bashir  Era,  ch  .4).  The  following 
February,  al-Bashir  reassigned  several  senior  army  officers  as  a  precaution, 
and  al-Turabi  was  arrested.  As  late  as  March  2004,  the  government 
claimed  to  have  uncovered  plans  for  yet  another  coup,  arresting  a  small 
number  of  anny  and  police  officers  as  well  as  members  of  al-Turabi’s 
political  party.  Despite  such  manifestations  of  discontent  in  Sudan’s  armed 
forces,  there  was  no  indication  in  early  2011  that  a  new  government,  civil¬ 
ian  or  military,  would  replace  the  al-Bashir  regime  anytime  soon.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  Armed  Forces  in  Sudanese  Society 

The  British  created  an  indigenous  officer  corps  that  by  World  War  II 
consisted  largely  of  Sudanese  who  came  from  upper-  and  middle-class 
urban  families.  After  that,  greater  numbers  were  drawn  from  the  mer¬ 
chant  sector  and  the  civil  service  in  urban  areas,  where  formal  elementary 
and  secondary  education  was  more  easily  obtainable.  Officer  cadets,  who 
had  to  possess  a  fourth-year  secondary-school  certificate,  were  selected 
on  the  basis  of  competitive  written  and  oral  examinations.  A  requirement 
that  cadets  possess  a  good  knowledge  of  Arabic  eliminated  many  South¬ 
erners  who  had  been  educated  in  English.  As  of  1981,  only  5-10  percent 
of  all  Sudanese  officer  cadets  were  Southerners. 

The  high  quality  of  incoming  officers  during  the  period  before  inde¬ 
pendence  diminished  thereafter,  largely  because  of  an  expansion  in  the 
size  of  the  amiy,  particularly  during  the  1968-72  surge  in  recruitment.  The 
SCP,  which  was  entrenched  in  the  universities  and  trade  unions  during  the 
1960s,  contributed  to  the  emergence  of  a  generation  of  officers  who  were 
predominantly  anti-Western  and  radical.  Many  officers  received  initial 
training  from  Soviet  military  advisers.  On  July  19,  1971,  a  failed  coup 
attempt  against  al-Numayri  allegedly  instigated  by  members  of  the  SCP 
supported  by  the  Iraqi  Baath  Party  led  to  the  dismissal  of  many  officers 
with  leftist  leanings.  As  a  result,  the  officer  corps  became  increasingly 
rightist  and  supported  al-Numayri's  shift  toward  strengthened  relations 
with  the  West  and  Egypt. 

The  military  faction  that  deposed  al-Numayri  in  1985  was  not  dis¬ 
tinguished  by  any  particular  political  orientation,  although  some  mem¬ 
bers  maintained  links  with  social,  religious,  and  ethnic  groups.  Despite 
al-Numayri ’s  Islamization  program  and,  later,  al-Bashir’s  links  to  the 
NIF,  no  more  than  5  percent  of  career  officers  in  the  early  1990s  were 
thought  to  be  Islamist  activists.  Most  officers  were  modem  in  outlook, 
of  middle-class  and  urban  backgrounds,  and  inclined  to  be  nonsectar¬ 
ian.  However,  by  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s,  a  growing  number  of 
officers  sought  to  further  their  careers  by  embracing  or  at  least  paying 
lip  service  to  the  government’s  Islamist  agenda. 

Historical  factors  also  influenced  the  SAP’s  political  and  ethnic 
makeup.  During  the  Anglo-Egyptian  Condominium,  many  members  of 
the  Khatmiyyah  (see  Glossary)  politico-religious  sect  and  nomadic  peo¬ 
ples  of  northeastern  Sudan  served  in  the  military.  By  the  1980s,  how¬ 
ever,  Sudanese  from  the  northeast  and  the  Nile  Valley  constituted  no 
more  than  20  percent  of  the  military  establishment,  although  they  con¬ 
tinued  to  be  well  represented  in  the  officer  corps.  Many  officers  had  ties 
to  the  Khatmiyyah  group  and  to  the  al-Mirghani  family  and  supported 
the  Democratic  Unionist  Party  (DUP).  Under  al-Bashir,  Northerners

continued  to  dominate  the  senior  leadership,  although  some  Southerners 
held  sensitive  positions. 

In  the  early  1980s,  members  of  the  Ansar  and  others  from  Darfur 
and  Kordofan  provinces  accounted  for  approximately  60  percent  of 
the  SAF’s  enlisted  manpower.  The  Ansar  and  other  Western  Sudanese 
might  have  been  more  numerous  in  the  uniformed  services  had  not  al- 
Numayri  imposed  recruitment  restrictions  on  these  groups  because 
many  were  perceived  to  be  opposed  to  his  government. 

The  presence  in  the  armed  forces  of  non-Muslim  black  Southerners 
has  been  a  source  of  contention  since  the  condominium  period.  Until 
after  World  War  II,  Southerners  served  only  in  the  Equatoria  Corps 
and  rarely  alongside  Northern  Sudanese.  Khartoum  suspended  recruit¬ 
ment  of  Southerners  after  the  1955  Southern  mutiny.  The  following 
year,  the  SAF  resumed  recruitment  of  Southerners,  but  they  were 
required  to  serve  in  the  North  under  Northern  officers. 

Nonetheless,  the  civil  war  in  the  South  discouraged  many  there  from 
joining  the  SAF  until  the  signing  of  the  1972  Addis  Ababa  Agreement.  As 
part  of  that  agreement,  6,000  former  Anya  Nya  guerrillas  were  integrated 
into  the  SAF  Southern  Command  to  serve  with  6,000  Northerners.  By 
including  Southern  officers  in  senior  positions  in  the  Southern  Command, 
the  two  forces  appeared  to  have  meshed  successfully.  A  1982  estimate 


311 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


indicated  that  Southerners  outnumbered  Northerners  7,000  to  5,000  in  the 
Southern  Command.  However,  there  were  relatively  few  Southerners  sta¬ 
tioned  in  the  North,  and  none  held  important  commands.  In  1983  al- 
Numayri  transferred  Southern  troops  to  the  North  because  of  doubts  about 
their  loyalty.  Southerners  opposed  this  decision  and  used  it  to  help  justify  a 
renewal  of  conflict  in  the  South. 

Given  the  state  of  war  between  the  al-Bashir  regime  and  the 
SPLM/A,  there  were  only  limited  opportunities  for  Southerners  in  the 
SAF  during  the  1990s.  As  a  consequence  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace 
Agreement  of  January  2005,  however,  Southerners  not  only  held  high 
positions  in  the  SPLM/A,  but  at  least  some  positions  in  the  SAF.  Even 
so,  it  was  clear  that  Arab  officers  from  the  northern  Nile  region  contin¬ 
ued  to  dominate  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces. 

External  Security  Concerns 

None  of  Sudan’s  neighbors  (Egypt,  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  Kenya,  Uganda, 
the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  the  Central  African  Republic, 
Chad,  and  Libya)  posed  a  serious  threat  to  the  country  in  early  2011. 
Since  the  1960s,  however,  some  30  proxy  wars  have  been  waged  in  Eri¬ 
trea,  Ethiopia,  Somalia,  Uganda,  Chad,  Libya,  and  in  Sudan.  Moreover, 
most  of  Sudan’s  neighbors  provided  cash,  sanctuaries,  or  weapons  to 
anti-Khartoum  groups.  In  turn,  Sudan  gave  similar  support  to  insurgent 
groups  in  Chad,  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  Somalia,  and  Uganda. 

Relations  with  Neighboring  States 

Sudan’s  relations  with  its  neighbors  frequently  vacillated  between 
periods  of  tension  and  cooperation.  On  June  26,  1995,  for  example, 
nine  Egyptian  Muslim  Brotherhood  terrorists  attempted  to  assassinate 
Egyptian  president  Husni  Mubarak  as  he  arrived  in  Addis  Ababa  to 
attend  a  meeting  of  the  Organization  of  African  Unity,  now  the  African 
Union  (see  Sudan  and  International  Terrorism,  ch.  1).  On  September  1, 
the  Ethiopian  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  accused  Sudanese  security 
personnel  of  involvement  in  the  attack.  Addis  Ababa  also  berated 
Khartoum  for  sheltering  three  of  the  alleged  assassins. 

A  day  after  the  failed  assassination  attempt,  Sudanese  and  Egyptian 
troops  clashed  over  the  status  of  the  disputed  border  region  of  Hala’ib. 
Two  Sudanese  died  during  the  encounter  while  several  troops  on  both 
sides  sustained  injuries.  On  June  28,  Egypt  ordered  70  Sudanese  police 
who  had  been  jointly  guarding  posts  in  Hala’ib  to  leave  that  enclave. 

Sudanese  vice  president  Salah  Zubayr  visited  Cairo  in  January  1 997 
but  received  a  cool  reception  from  President  Mubarak,  who  informed  him 
that  Egypt  would  not  provide  military  aid  to  Sudan  and  chastised  Sudan 


312 


National  Security 


for  “harboring  militant  Islamists.”  Relations  between  the  two  countries 
warmed  later  that  year,  however,  during  another  visit  by  Salah  Zubayr, 
when  Mubarak  expressed  willingness  to  “forgive  and  forget”  because  he 
feared  a  United  States-backed  partition  of  Sudan  that  could  threaten  the 
1959  Nile  Waters  Treaty  between  Egypt  and  Sudan  (see  Economic  Devel¬ 
opments  since  Independence,  ch.l).  Sudan’s  foreign  minister,  Mustafa 
Uthman  Isma’il,  also  declared  that  1998  would  be  the  “year  of  normaliza¬ 
tion”  because  air  and  trade  links  between  the  two  countries  would  be 
restored.  More  recently,  the  Egyptians,  in  dealing  with  Darfur,  confronted 
the  need  to  balance  relations  with  the  Sudanese  government  with  those  of 
other  internal  political  actors.  Among  their  contributions  have  been 
humanitarian  aid  and  the  deployment  of  Egyptian  troops  to  the  force  of  the 
United  Nations-African  Union  Mission  in  Darfur  (UNAMID). 

In  the  early  1990s,  relations  with  Ethiopia  and  newly  independent  Eri¬ 
trea  were  disturbed  by  such  issues  as  support  for  insurgents  in  each 
other’s  territories  and  by  the  militant  Islamism  of  the  National  Islamic 
Front  (NIF)  and  the  National  Congress  Party.  Eritrean  president  Issaias 
Afwerki  and  Ethiopian  president  (later  prime  minister)  Meles  Zenawi 
met  with  President  al-Bashir  in  Addis  Ababa  in  July  1994.  The  two  lead¬ 
ers  told  al-Bashir  to  “stop  meddling  with  our  Muslims  and  keep  your 
brand  of  Islam  within  the  borders  of  Sudan.”  Al-Bashir  denied  any 
wrongdoing.  However,  al-Turabi,  the  influential  Islamist  who  headed  the 
NIF,  believed  that  Sudan,  Somalia,  Eritrea,  and  Ethiopia  would  become 
an  Islamic  community  much  like  the  European  Community  (later  Euro¬ 
pean  Union)  and  that  borders  would  disappear,  a  belief  that  perhaps  justi¬ 
fied  Sudan’s  interest  in  its  neighbors’  Muslims. 

Eritrea  sponsored  a  December  1 994  meeting  between  the  SPLM/A 
and  several  prominent  Sudanese  opposition  groups,  including  the 
Umma  Party,  the  DUP,  and  the  Sudanese  Allied  Forces.  In  January 
1995,  President  Issaias  turned  over  Sudan’s  embassy  in  Asmara  to  the 
National  Democratic  Alliance  (NDA),  a  coalition  of  groups  opposed  to 
the  regime  in  Khartoum.  A  reversal  of  affairs  occurred  on  January  4, 
2000,  when  Sudan  and  Eritrea  signed  a  joint  communique  to  restore  dip¬ 
lomatic  ties.  The  two  countries  agreed  to  reopen  border  crossing  points, 
reopen  embassies  in  both  countries,  and  resume  regular  air  service.  By 
then,  Eritrea  wished  to  stabilize  relations  with  Sudan  because  of  the  pos¬ 
sibility  of  renewed  conflict  with  Ethiopia  after  the  two  nations  fought  a 
war  in  1998. 

Eritrea  and  Sudan  have  enjoyed  a  more  productive  relationship  in 
recent  years.  In  May  2005,  for  example,  the  Eritrean  and  Sudanese 
presidents  met  on  the  margins  of  the  Tripoli  Summit  on  Darfur  to  dis¬ 
cuss  the  peace  process  in  Eastern  Sudan.  In  mid-2006,  Eritrea,  which 
had  supported  the  insurgents,  began  negotiations  to  end  the  conflict

between  Khartoum  and  the  Eastern  Front.  After  signing  a  declaration 
of  principles  in  June,  the  warring  parties  concluded  a  peace  agreement 
in  Asmara  on  October  14,  2006.  Eritrea  also  deployed  some  200  sol¬ 
diers  to  help  monitor  the  Sudan-Chad  border.  Between  2006  and 
2011,  the  two  governments  enjoyed  good  relations. 

Sudanese-Ethiopian  relations  also  improved.  In  January  2006,  Ethi¬ 
opia  and  Sudan  agreed  to  strengthen  development  activities  and  pre¬ 
vent  illegal  trade  in  border  areas.  On  December  6,  2007,  President  al- 
Bashir  and  Prime  Minister  Meles  Zenawi  inaugurated  the  Al-Gedaref- 
Doka-Gallabat-Matammah  highway  connecting  Sudan  and  northwest 
Ethiopia,  which  facilitated  trade,  including  in  oil,  between  the  two 
neighbors.  In  January  2008,  the  two  countries  also  agreed  to  construct  a 
road  connecting  Al-Damazin  and  Kurmuk  with  Assosa  in  Ethiopia. 

Kenya  and  Uganda  supported  the  SPLM/A  with  cash  and  weapons 
and  welcomed  the  presence  of  SPLM/A  personnel  in  their  capitals  from 
1989  until  2005.  Nairobi  and  Kampala  shared  harsh  attitudes  toward  the 
Islamist  regime  in  Khartoum.  Nevertheless,  Kenya  played  a  key  role  in 
negotiations  that  eventually  led  to  the  signing  of  the  CPA.  Since  2005 
Kenya  and  Uganda  generally  supported  the  South’s  president,  Salva  Kiir, 
and  his  policies,  and  both  benefited  from  substantial  commercial  and 
other  ties  with  the  Government  of  South  Sudan  (GOSS),  despite  the  new 
nation  having  some  serious  disagreements  with  these  two  neighbors. 

Sudanese-Chadian  relations  have  experienced  periods  of  tension 
because  of  instability  in  Darfur.  The  border  between  the  two  countries 
is  difficult  to  control,  and  several  Darfuri  groups,  namely  the  Fur, 
Masalit,  Daju,  and  Zaghawa,  reside  on  both  sides  of  it  and  have  long 
engaged  in  cross-border  raids  in  support  of  their  kinsmen  when  in  con¬ 
flict  with  one  or  the  other  central  government.  Repeated  attempts  at 
reconciliation  between  Chad  and  Sudan  had  borne  fruit  by  20 1 1 . 

During  much  of  the  1980s,  Chadian  rebels  mounted  operations 
against  N’Djamena  from  bases  in  Darfur.  Additionally,  Libyan  troops 
and  Libyan-supported  units  of  the  Islamic  Legion  (a  pan- Arab  paramili¬ 
tary  force  sponsored  by  Libya)  frequently  deployed  to  Darfur  in  search 
of  rebels  or  to  participate  in  fighting  between  Arab  and  non-Arab  ethnic 
groups.  Khartoum  lacked  the  capabilities  to  prevent  the  well-equipped 
Libyan-backed  units  from  occupying  parts  of  Darfur  during  their  Chad¬ 
ian  campaigns. 

Another  Chadian  war  began  in  December  2005.  The  conflict  involved 
Chadian  troops  and  several  rebel  groups,  including  the  United  Front  for 
Democratic  Change,  the  Alliance  of  Revolutionary  Forces  of  West 
Sudan,  janjaweed  (see  Glossary),  as  well  as  the  Sudanese  government, 
which  supported  the  rebels.  On  February  8, 2006,  the  Tripoli  Agreement

National  Security 


ended  the  fighting  for  approximately  two  months.  The  Chadian  government 
estimated  that  614  Chadian  citizens  had  been  killed  during  the  fighting. 

A  rift  between  the  Zaghawa  and  Tama  groups  developed  in  2007,  in 
which  the  Zaghawa,  to  which  Chad’s  president,  Idriss  Deby,  belongs, 
accused  Sudan  of  supporting  members  of  the  rival  Tama  group.  The 
Chadian  government  repeatedly  accused  Sudan  of  providing  cash  and 
weapons  to  the  United  Front  for  Democratic  Change,  and  in  December 
2007  it  accused  Sudan  of  giving  rebels  airtime  on  Sudanese  state  televi¬ 
sion.  After  a  second  attack  on  the  Chadian  border  town  of  Adre,  Suda¬ 
nese  citizens  were  among  the  attackers  taken  prisoner.  Fighting  persisted 
thereafter  among  armed  groups  supported  by  each  government  against 
the  other,  punctuated  by  several  attempts  at  renewed  peace  agreements 
until  2009,  when  Chad  and  Sudan  began  a  process  of  diplomatic  and  mil¬ 
itary  rapprochement. 

Sudan’s  security  relationship  with  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the 
Congo  (DRC— formerly  Zaire)  has  focused  primarily  on  the  small- 
arms  trade  between  the  two  countries.  Weapons  flowed  primarily  from 
South  Sudan  to  the  DRC — a  traffic  that  grew  as  eastern  Zaire  experi¬ 
enced  civil  war  in  the  later  1990s.  Serving  and  former  SPLM/A  sol¬ 
diers  conducted  trade  in  an  array  of  weapons,  including  AK-47s, 
recoilless  rifles,  mortars,  rocket-propelled  grenades,  machine  guns,  and 
pistols.  Demand  for  such  weapons  was  and  remained  greatest  in  the 
Ituri  and  North  Kivu  regions  of  the  DRC;  demand  was  far  lower  farther 
west  among  the  Azande,  many  of  whom  relied  on  traditional  weapons 
or  their  own,  often  inherited,  arms. 

During  the  second  Sudanese  civil  war  (1983-2005),  thousands  of 
SPLM/A  members  went  to  the  Central  African  Republic  (CAR)  to  find 
food  or  safe  havens  during  times  of  drought  or  military  offensives.  Dur¬ 
ing  the  1 990s,  the  CAR  served  as  a  staging  area  for  S AF  attacks  against 
SPLM/A  units  in  western  Bahr  al-Ghazal.  These  clashes  caused  some 
36,000  Sudanese  to  flee  to  CAR  as  refugees.  Some  of  these  individuals 
belonged  to  the  SPLM/A,  who  brought  some  5,000  weapons  with  them. 
By  2004,  the  SPLM/A  supposedly  occupied  towns  as  far  as  200  kilome¬ 
ters  into  the  CAR. 

Sudan  established  transit  routes  through  northern  CAR  in  early 
April  2006.  The  Darfur-based  United  Front  for  Democratic  Change 
crossed  through  northeastern  CAR  en  route  to  attack  N’Djamena.  The 
CAR  government  responded  by  closing  its  border  with  Sudan.  How¬ 
ever,  Sudanese  Antonovs  flew  to  a  CAR  airfield  with  a  cargo  of  weap¬ 
ons  and  some  50  uniformed  men.  Despite  such  provocations, 
Sudanese-CAR  relations  have  remained  relatively  good. 

In  the  late  2000s,  relations  among  Sudan,  the  CAR,  and  the  DRC 
were  troubled  by  the  presence  of  the  Lord’s  Resistance  Army  (LRA).

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Originally  a  messianic  movement  in  Uganda  that  became  known  for  kid¬ 
napping,  maiming,  and  killing,  the  LRA  fled  Uganda  in  the  mid-2000s 
and  relocated  to  South  Sudan  and  the  DRC.  Since  then,  the  LRA  has 
committed  atrocities  in  northeastern  DRC,  southeastern  CAR,  and  south¬ 
eastern  Sudan.  Its  forces  have  operated  in  small  parties  that  easily  escape 
pursuers.  In  more  recent  years,  the  LRA  was  responsible  for  killings  in 
Darfur.  As  of  2010-11,  it  was  most  active  in  West  Equatoria,  where  its 
sporadic  raids  involving  burning,  looting,  and  killing  constitute  a  secu¬ 
rity  problem  for  GOSS. 

United  States-Sudanese  Relations 

Apart  from  Sudan’s  neighbors,  the  United  States  was  the  country 
pursuing  the  most  aggressive  policy  toward  Sudan.  In  December  1994, 
Washington  supported  elements  hostile  to  al-Bashir — primarily  Eri¬ 
trea,  Ethiopia,  and  Uganda — to  help  create  the  Asmara-based  National 
Democratic  Alliance  (NDA).  This  organization  enabled  the  SPLM/A  to 
cooperate  with  other  groups  opposed  to  al-Bashir,  such  as  the  Umma 
Party,  the  DUP,  and  the  Sudanese  Allied  Forces. 

Washington  launched  the  so-called  Front  Line  States  policy  in  early 
1 995  to  facilitate  the  downfall  of  the  al-Bashir  regime  (see  United  States, 
eh.  4).  To  accomplish  this  goal,  the  United  States  provided  US$20  mil¬ 
lion  worth  of  military  equipment  to  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  and  Uganda.  Each 
of  these  countries  deployed  a  limited  number  of  troops  to  Sudan,  but 
given  Sudan’s  size,  this  strategy  failed  to  accomplish  anything. 

The  campaign  to  isolate  Sudan  peaked  in  January  1996,  when  the  UN 
Security  Council,  strongly  supported  by  the  United  States,  adopted  Reso¬ 
lution  1044,  which  condemned  Sudan  as  a  threat  to  regional  peace. 
Washington  also  moved  most  of  its  diplomats  from  Khartoum  to  the  U.S. 
Embassy  in  Nairobi,  leaving  only  a  small  number  of  locally  hired  For¬ 
eign  Service  personnel  on  duty  in  the  embassy  in  Khartoum,  with  occa¬ 
sional  support  from  visiting  U.S.  diplomats  then  based  in  Kenya.  In  April 
1996,  the  UN  Security  Council,  with  U.S.  support,  imposed  additional 
sanctions  on  Sudan,  including  restrictions  on  foreign  travel  of  Sudanese 
government  officials  and  a  ban  on  holding  international  conferences  in 
Sudan.  Such  tactics  failed  to  alter  Sudan’s  policies  and  regional  activities. 

The  bombings  of  the  American  embassies  in  Nairobi  and  Dar  es 
Salaam  and  the  U.S.  retaliatory  attack  on  the  Al-Shifa  pharmaceutical 
factory  in  Khartoum  North  in  August  1998  marked  the  nadir  of  U.S.- 
Sudanese  relations.  Following  the  September  1 1, 2001,  terrorist  strikes 
in  New  York  City  and  Washington,  however,  the  U.S.  view  of  Sudan 
became  somewhat  more  nuanced.  Although  sanctions  remained  in 
force  and  Washington  continued  to  condemn  the  wars  in  the  South  and 
in  Darfur,  the  George  W.  Bush  administration  came  to  view  Sudan  as  a 


316 


National  Security 


potentially  useful  source  of  intelligence  on  terrorists,  especially 
Osama  bin  Laden  and  Al-Qaeda.  For  their  part,  the  Sudanese  sought 
removal  from  the  U.S.  list  of  state  sponsors  of  terrorism  and  the  lifting 
of  U.S.  economic  sanctions.  Contacts  between  the  two  countries  about 
terrorist  activities  in  the  Middle  East  advanced  to  the  point  that  the 
head  of  Sudanese  intelligence,  Major  General  Salah  Abdallah  Gosh, 
was  received  in  Washington  in  2005,  according  to  reports  in  U.S. 
media.  This  cooperation  in  intelligence  sharing,  confirmed  in  2007  by 
high-ranking  Sudanese  and  U.S.  officials,  demonstrated  that  despite 
their  profound  differences  over  Darfur  and  human  rights,  Sudan  and 
the  U.S.  had  found  common  ground  in  the  effort  to  counter  interna¬ 
tional  terrorism.  Even  so,  Sudan  remained  on  the  list  of  state  sponsors 
of  terrorism  and  subject  to  U.S.  economic  sanctions. 

Civil  Warfare  in  the  South  and  West 

Except  for  a  period  of  tenuous  peace  from  1972  to  1983,  Sudan 
experienced  continual  armed  rebellion  in  the  South  between  1955  and 
the  early  2000s.  The  protracted  struggle  pitted  the  mostly  Muslim 
North  against  the  partly  Christian  and  animist  South.  It  claimed  an  esti¬ 
mated  2  million  lives — mostly  noncombatants — and  forced  millions  of 
others  to  flee  the  South  in  search  of  food  and  to  escape  the  violence. 
Both  sides  committed  massive  human-rights  violations  against  civil¬ 
ians.  In  the  1980s  and  1990s,  rebel  forces  controlled  parts  of  the  South 
and  occasionally  attacked  SAF  garrisoned  towns.  By  the  late  1990s,  it 
had  become  clear  that  neither  side  was  capable  of  scoring  a  decisive 
military  victory.  After  years  of  agonizing  negotiations,  government  and 
rebel  forces  signed  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  (CPA)  to  end 
the  conflict  in  January  2005. 

First  Southern  Civil  War,  1955-72 

In  August  1955,  troops  of  the  Equatoria  Corps,  together  with  police, 
mutinied  in  Torit  and  other  towns  in  the  South.  The  SAF  suppressed  these 
mutinies  although  some  rebels  escaped  to  mral  areas  and  formed  guerrilla 
bands.  However,  they  were  poorly  armed  and  organized  and  presented  no 
threat  to  the  government.  The  later  emergence  of  a  Southern  secessionist 
movement  led  to  the  formation  of  the  Anya  Nya  guerrilla  anny,  com¬ 
posed  of  remnants  of  the  1955  mutineers  and  recmits  among  Southern 
students.  Initially  active  only  in  Equatoria  (present-day  East  Equatoria, 
Central  Equatoria,  and  West  Equatoria),  Anya  Nya  carried  its  rebellion 
across  all  of  Southern  Sudan  between  1963  and  1969  (see  fig.  6,  eh.  1).  In 
1970  a  former  army  lieutenant,  Joseph  Lagu,  united  the  ethnically  frag¬ 
mented  guerrilla  bands  to  support  a  new  political  movement  called  the 


317

Southern  Sudan  Liberation  Front  (SSLF).  The  first  Southern  war  ended 
on  February  27,  1972,  when  the  warring  parties  signed  the  Addis  Ababa 
Agreement  that  established  autonomy  and  religious  rights  for  South 
Sudanese  and  a  single  regional  government,  the  Southern  Sudan  Provi¬ 
sional  Government,  with  defined  powers.  The  document  also  established 
four  subregional  governments  based  on  ethnicity  as  part  of  a  federal  sys¬ 
tem  of  governance  in  the  South.  Ironically,  many  Sudanese  outside  the 
country  accused  Southern  leaders  of  collaborating  with  Khartoum. 

Second  Southern  Civil  War,  1983-2005 

The  SAF  absorbed  Anya  Nya  fighters  into  its  ranks  under  the  terms  of 
Addis  Ababa  Agreement,  although  many  Southern  units  opposed  the 
agreement  by  defecting  or  taking  refuge  in  Ethiopia.  Addis  Ababa  aided 
Sudan's  independent  rebel  bands  because  Khartoum  had  provided  sup¬ 
port  to  Eritrean  rebels.  The  Sudanese  rebel  forces  gathered  further 
recruits,  predominantly  among  the  Nuer  people  but  also  among  the 
Dinka,  the  largest  groups  in  the  South,  and  eventually  adopted  the  name 
of  Anya  Nya  II.  Those  original  Anya  Nya  who  had  been  absorbed  into 
the  SAF  after  the  1972  agreement  fought  the  guerrillas  on  behalf  of  the 
national  government.  However,  when  al-Numayri  redivided  the  South 
and  imposed  Islamic  law,  the  loyalty  of  Southern  soldiers  wavered. 
Uncertain  of  their  dependability,  al-Numayri  introduced  more  Northern 
troops  into  the  South  and  attempted  to  transfer  the  former  guerrillas  to  the 
North.  In  mid- 1983,  SAF  units  in  Bor,  Pibor  Post,  Pochala,  and  other 
Southern  garrisons  mutinied.  In  July  1983,  Anya  Nya  II  and  mutinous 
anny  personnel  met  in  Ethiopia  and  formed  the  Sudan  People's  Libera¬ 
tion  Movement/ Army  (SPLM/A).  John  Garang  de  Mabior,  a  Dinka, 
served  as  its  military-political  commander.  But  Southerners  failed  to 
achieve  unity  under  Garang,  whose  forces  eventually  defeated  Anya  Nya 
II  dissident  units.  Thereafter,  the  defeated  remnants,  still  calling  them¬ 
selves  Anya  Nya  II,  cooperated  with  the  SAF  against  the  SPLM/A. 

The  SPLM/A’s  tactics  initially  included  ambushes  of  military  vehi¬ 
cles  and  assaults  on  police  stations  and  small  army  posts,  mainly  in  the 
Nuer  and  Dinka  areas  of  what  were  then  A’ali  an-Nil  and  northern  and 
eastern  Bahr  al-Ghazal.  An  SPLM/A  attempt  to  invade  eastern  Al-Isti- 
wai  in  early  1 985  met  stiff  resistance  from  the  SAF  and  government 
militias  (see  fig.  7,  ch.  1).  In  1986  the  SPLM/A  occupied  Rumbek  in 
southern  Bahr  al-Ghazal  for  several  months  and  attacked  Wau,  the 
provincial  capital.  During  1987,  the  SPLM/A  took  Kurmuk,  Pibor 
Post,  Qaysan,  and  Tonga  in  A’ali  an-Nil.  By  early  1988,  the  SPLM/A 
had  captured  several  towns  on  the  Ethiopian  border. 

Many  communities  in  Al-Istiwai  Province,  where  the  Dinka  and 
their  Nuer  allies  were  unpopular,  opposed  the  SPLM/A.  The  SAF, 


318

with  support  from  a  militia  of  the  Mandari  (also  seen  as  Mundari)  peo¬ 
ple,  gradually  consolidated  its  position  in  eastern  Al-Istiwai.  By  1988, 
the  SPLM/A  controlled  the  countryside  around  Juba,  the  major  South¬ 
ern  city.  Some  1 0,000  SAF  troops  were  cut  off  from  supplies  except 
for  what  could  be  delivered  by  air.  From  May  to  October  1989,  an 
informal  truce  prevailed.  After  the  conflict  resumed,  the  areas  being 
contested  were  principally  in  western  Al-Istiwai,  focusing  on  the  Juba 
and  Yei  government  garrisons.  The  fighting  frequently  consisted  of 
SPLM/A  ambushes  of  government  convoys  moving  supplies  from  the 
North.  Captured  weapons  and  arms  imported  from  Ethiopia  and  other 
African  countries  enabled  the  SPLM/A  to  acquire  armored  vehicles 
and  artillery,  but  the  Southern  forces  avoided  conventional  engage¬ 
ments  against  SAF  units. 

Anya  Nya  II  began  to  crumble  in  the  late  1 980s,  as  many  units  and 
their  commanders  deserted  to  the  SPLM/A.  Government-supported 
militias  had  become  active  by  then  in  areas  where  opposition  to  the 
Dinka-  and  Nuer-dominated  SPLM/A  was  strongest.  These  militias 
played  a  major  role  in  the  fighting  and  were  partly  responsible  for  the 
ravages  the  civilian  population  endured.  The  arming  of  tribal  groups 
inflamed  existing  intercommunal  conflicts  and  resulted  in  the  deaths 
of  tens  of  thousands  of  noncombatants. 

Millions  of  villagers  fled  their  homes  as  a  consequence  of  the  fighting 
and  the  depredations  of  militias,  the  SPLM/A,  Anya  Nya  II,  and  the  SAF.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Devastation  of  northern  Bahr  al-Ghazal  by  roving  murahalin  (Arab  militia 
groups)  forced  many  people  to  evacuate  their  homes  in  1986-87  and  seek 
refuge  in  Northern  Sudan  to  escape  the  fighting  and  starvation  (see  Mili¬ 
tias,  this  eh.).  Raiding  decreased  in  1988-89  as  a  result  of  depopulation  of 
the  land  and  a  stronger  SPLM/A  presence  in  northern  Bahr  al-Ghazal. 
Nevertheless,  migrations  continued  because  of  severe  food  shortages.  By 
1989,  some  1  million  Southerners  had  settled  in  Khartoum,  while  hun¬ 
dreds  of  thousands  had  moved  to  other  cities  and  towns.  Additionally, 
some  350,000  Sudanese  registered  as  refugees  in  Ethiopia.  At  least 
100,000  had  sought  refuge  in  Juba  and  approximately  28,000  in  Uganda. 

On  August  28,  1991,  Riek  Machar,  a  Nuer,  and  Lam  Akol,  a  Shil- 
luk,  sent  a  radio  message,  which  subsequently  became  known  as  the 
Nasir  Declaration,  announcing  that  SPLM/A  commander  John  Garang 
had  been  deposed.  Machar  claimed  that  he  had  taken  over  as  interim 
leader.  According  to  Major  General  Clement  Wani,  governor  of  Central 
Equatoria,  the  al-Bashir  regime  provided  Machar  with  more  than 
10,000  weapons.  These  arms  allowed  cattle  herders  to  protect  their  live¬ 
stock  from  raids  by  the  SPLM/A,  but  they  also  fueled  conflict  between 
the  Lou  Nuer  of  present-day  central  Upper  Nile  and  the  Jikaan  Nuer  of 
eastern  Upper  Nile. 

Machar  enlisted  Nuer  youths,  who  covered  themselves  with  white 
ashes  to  protect  themselves  from  insects,  to  form  the  backbone  of  the 
“White  Army.”  His  strategy  was  to  attack  the  SPLM/A  heartland,  thus 
exposing  Garang  as  a  weak  leader  and  a  poor  military  commander.  The 
fighting  focused  largely  on  the  Bor  Dinka.  Reportedly,  the  White  Army 
killed  thousands  of  Bor  Dinka,  looted  villages,  and  stole  thousands  of 
cattle.  However,  Machar ’s  offensive  failed  to  defeat  Garang.  As  a  result, 
the  stature  of  the  Nuer  diminished  considerably,  but  the  White  Army 
continued  some  operations  thanks  to  additional  arms  from  Khartoum. 

Garang  announced  a  new  military  strategy  on  March  18,  1995, 
whereby  the  SPLM/A,  in  cooperation  with  Northern  Sudanese  opposi¬ 
tion  groups,  would  carry  the  war  to  the  North.  This  strategy  failed 
largely  because  the  Northern  groups  lacked  the  military  capabilities  to 
go  on  the  offensive  against  Khartoum.  Nevertheless,  on  October  21, 
1995,  the  SPLM/A  and  an  array  of  Northern  groups  that  included  the 
Army  Legitimate  Command,  DUP,  SCP,  and  Umma  Party  signed  the 
National  Democratic  Alliance  charter.  This  coalition  called  for  “open¬ 
ing  up  new  fronts  (in  the  East  or  West,  or  both)  and  preparing  for  a  rev¬ 
olutionary  insurrection  in  the  North.”  However,  the  NDA,  which  was 
headquartered  in  Asmara,  Eritrea,  posed  no  threat  to  the  al-Bashir  gov¬ 
ernment,  as  it  failed  to  launch  any  significant  military  operations. 

The  government  ordered  a  unilateral  cease-fire  throughout  South¬ 
ern  Sudan  on  March  3,  1996,  but  Garang  refused  to  accept  it.  Instead, 


320 


National  Security 


the  SPLM/A  attacked  towns  along  the  Sudanese-Ethiopian  border. 
However,  on  April  10,  1996,  Khartoum  signed  a  peace  accord  with  the 
South  Sudan  Independence  Movement  (SSIM)  and  the  SPLA-Bahr 
al-Ghazal  Group  led  by  Kerubino  Bol  Kuanyin,  a  former  SPLM/A 
deputy  commander.  Both  groups  pledged  to  preserve  Sudan’s  national 
unity  and  to  develop  war-tom  areas  of  South  Sudan,  but  they  failed  to 
achieve  either  goal. 

The  SAF  started  rounding  up  young  men  in  Khartoum  for  military 
service  in  March  1997;  in  late  May,  the  government  announced  that  all 
male  secondary  school  leavers  were  subject  to  compulsory  military  ser¬ 
vice.  On  April  21,  1997,  the  government  signed  the  Khartoum  Peace 
Agreement  with  the  Equatoria  Defense  Force,  South  Sudan  Indepen¬ 
dence  Group,  SSIM,  SPLA-Bahr  al-Ghazal  Group,  SPLA-Bor  Group, 
and  Union  of  Sudan  African  Parties.  The  agreement  guaranteed  “free¬ 
dom  of  movement,  assembly,  organization,  speech  and  press  and... an 
equitable  representation  of  southerners  at  all  levels  with  Sudan.” 

Conflict  continued  in  South  Sudan  over  the  next  six  years,  despite 
ongoing  regional  peace  talks  sponsored  by  the  Intergovernmental  Author¬ 
ity  on  Development  (IGAD — see  Glossary).  Then,  on  July  20,  2002,  the 
Sudanese  government  and  the  SPLM/A  signed  the  Machakos  Protocol, 
named  for  the  Kenyan  city  in  which  they  met,  which  provided  for  a  refer¬ 
endum  on  self-determination  for  the  South  after  a  six-year  transitional 
period.  On  October  1 7,  the  two  sides  agreed  to  a  cease-fire  throughout  all 
Sudan,  made  permanent  in  a  subsequent  protocol  of  December  2004.  A 
second  round  of  talks  in  Machakos  in  November  2002  resulted  in  the 
signing  of  an  agreement  that  proposed  a  structure  for  an  interim  govern¬ 
ment,  an  accord  signed  into  final  form  in  May  2004.  On  January  9,  2005, 
the  warring  parties  finally  signed  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement 
that  ended  one  of  Africa’s  most  costly  and  devastating  wars. 

Security  Provisions  of  the  CPA 

The  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  signed  by  the  Government 
of  Sudan  and  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement/ Army  in  Nai¬ 
robi,  Kenya,  on  January  9,  2005,  consisted  of  both  military  and  politi¬ 
cal  provisions  (see  Recent  Constitutional  Developments,  eh.  4).  The 
military  provisions  were  contained  in  the  Agreement  on  Permanent 
Cease-fire  and  Security  Modalities.  There  also  were  special  political 
and  security  arrangements  for  the  areas  of  Abyei,  Blue  Nile,  and  the 
Nuba  Mountains  of  South  Kordofan.  These  three  regions  bore  the  brunt 
of  hostilities  during  the  second  civil  war.  Given  their  strategic  location 
and  wealth,  including  oil,  they  were  deemed  critical  to  long-term  stabil¬ 
ity  in  Sudan  and  hence  were  accorded  special  status.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


The  CPA  called  for  an  internationally  monitored  cease-fire  in  the 
South  and  East  (Darfur  was  not  included  in  this  arrangement).  The 
forces  of  each  side  were  to  disengage  and  redeploy  to  their  home  areas 
on  either  side  of  the  North-South  border  as  defined  on  January  1, 
1956.  Both  were  to  downsize  proportionately,  and  if  the  South  had 
voted  for  unity  in  the  2011  referendum  on  self-determination,  they 
would  have  combined  into  a  new  national  army.  The  CPA  required 
Joint/Integrated  Units  (JIUs)  to  be  formed  by  equal  numbers  of  sol¬ 
diers  from  both  North  and  South,  to  ensure  security  in  strategic  areas 
and  give  practical  effect  to  the  principle  of  unity,  and  to  become  the 
nucleus  of  a  national  army,  were  there  to  be  one  after  mid-2011.  A 
Joint  Defense  Board  composed  of  chiefs  of  staff  and  their  deputies 
from  both  North  and  South  was  established  to  coordinate  their  respec¬ 
tive  forces  and  to  command  the  JIUs. 

The  two  sides  agreed  to  create  an  Assessment  and  Evaluation  Com¬ 
mission  to  ensure  that  both  parties  lived  up  to  the  CPA’s  provisions. 
They  also  created  a  Cease-fire  Political  Commission  and  a  Cease-fire 
Joint  Military  Committee  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  cease-fire 
agreement.  Finally,  the  two  sides  called  for  the  United  Nations  to  send  a 
peace-support  mission  to  Sudan  to  monitor  and  verify  the  implementa¬ 
tion  of  the  security  provisions,  to  oversee  the  national  demobilization, 
disarmament,  and  reintegration  campaign  involving  soldiers  on  both 
sides,  and  to  support  implementation  of  the  CPA  in  general. 

The  CPA  enjoyed  some  success  in  ensuing  years,  but  resolving  secu¬ 
rity  issues  and  problems  between  the  al-Bashir  government  and  the 
SPLM/A  remained  problematic.  For  example,  the  cease-fire  in  the  South 
and  East  was  implemented  with  a  corresponding  degree  of  security  in 
the  former  war  zones,  and  the  redeployment  of  troops  also  occurred, 
albeit  on  a  delayed  schedule.  In  other  undertakings,  however,  the  cooper¬ 
ation  between  North  and  South  foreseen  in  the  CPA  was  elusive  if  not 
wholly  absent. 

The  experience  of  the  JIUs  illustrated  the  strengths  and  weaknesses 
of  the  CPA’s  security  provisions.  The  JIUs  were  intended  to  enhance 
security  in  contentious  areas  during  the  six-year  interim  period  prior  to 
the  20 1 1  Southern  referendum  on  secession  and  to  demonstrate  that  both 
sides  were  committed  to  national  unity.  The  JIUs  were  also  to  serve  as  a 
confidence-building  measure  that  might  lead  to  the  establishment  of  a 
post-referendum  national  army.  They  were  to  be  funded  by  the  presi¬ 
dency  rather  than  through  the  SAF  and  the  SPLM/A,  an  arrangement 
designed  to  eliminate  pay  irregularities  and  preclude  any  appearance  of 
favoritism. 

The  authorized  troop  level  for  the  JIUs  was  39,600  troops,  divided 
equally  between  the  SAF  and  the  SPLM/A.  JIU  deployed  forces  included

24,000  in  South  Sudan,  600  in  Abyei,  6,000  in  the  Nuba  Mountains,  and 
3,000  in  Khartoum.  Another  five  JIU  divisions  were  deployed  in  Al- 
Damazin,  Juba,  Kaduqli,  Malakal,  and  Wau.  There  was  also  a  JIU  head¬ 
quarters  element  in  Juba,  an  independent  brigade  in  Khartoum,  and  an 
Abyei  Area  Independent  Battalion. 

The  JIUs  enjoyed  some  minor  successes  aside  from  their  formation 
and  deployment,  including  the  creation  of  standard  operating  proce¬ 
dures,  some  joint  patrols,  and  a  commitment  to  establish  a  weapons-free 
zone  in  Wau.  Nonetheless,  the  JIUs  faced  a  daunting  array  of  problems, 
including  repeated  deployment  delays,  poor  command  and  control,  and 
inadequate  integration  of  the  SAF  and  the  SPLM/A  forces. 

The  operational  limitations  of  the  JIUs  became  evident  in  Abyei  in 
mid-May  2008.  A  meeting  point  between  the  Dinka  and  Missiriyya 
peoples  that  is  also  a  major  oil-producing  area,  Abyei  had  been  a 
potential  flash  point  between  North  and  South  since  the  signing  of  the 
CPA.  A  boundary-demarcation  proposal  that  had  been  accepted  by 
GOSS  but  rejected  by  the  al-Bashir  government,  together  with  dis¬ 
putes  over  the  division  of  oil  revenues,  set  the  stage  for  local  clashes  in 
mid-May  between  the  SPLM/A  and  the  SAF  and  their  allied  militias. 
In  days  of  fighting  between  SPLM/A  and  SAF,  the  soldiers  in  the  JIU 
split  into  JIU-SAF  and  JIU-SPLM/A  and  joined  their  respective  sides 
in  fighting  that  devastated  the  small  market  town  of  Abyei.  By  July

both  sides  had  recommitted  themselves  to  a  unified  JIU  in  Abyei,  but 
neither  the  JIUs  nor  UN  peacekeepers  were  able  to  prevent  renewed 
clashes  between  the  local  Ngok  Dinka  and  Missiriyya  nomads  in  2010 
and  early  2011.  Problems  of  a  different  nature  arose  within  JIUs  in  the 
southern  part  of  Upper  Nile  State  in  early  2011.  In  this  instance, 
Southern  militiamen,  formerly  aligned  with  Khartoum  but  after  2005 
drafted  as  SAF  units  into  the  JIUs  of  Upper  Nile  State,  mutinied  when 
Northern  commanders  ordered  them  to  surrender  their  heavy  weapons 
and  relocate  to  the  North.  The  mutiny  was  contained,  but  the  basic 
issues  remained  unresolved. 

The  UN  secretary-general  on  January  31,  2005,  had  recommended 
the  deployment  of  a  peace-support  operation  for  South  Sudan  to  be 
known  as  the  United  Nations  Mission  in  Sudan  (UNMIS),  a  recom¬ 
mendation  the  Security  Council  adopted  on  March  25.  The  force  was 
to  consist  of  a  maximum  of  10,000  military  personnel,  including  750 
military  observers  and  7 1 5  civilian  police.  By  April,  four  African  and 
22  non-African  countries  had  pledged  troops,  who  were  to  observe  the 
cease-fire  in  South  Sudan,  aid  and  monitor  the  formation  of  the  JIUs, 
and  facilitate  disannament  and  demobilization.  Additionally,  they 
were  to  restructure  the  national  and  Southern  police  forces,  promote 
human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law,  support  efforts  to  prepare  for  the 
2011  referendum,  ease  the  return  of  refugees  and  displaced  persons, 
and  carry  out  demining  activities. 

To  facilitate  the  disarmament,  demobilization,  and  reintegration 
(DDR)  program,  the  CPA  called  for  establishment  of  a  national  DDR 
council  that  would  oversee  separate  DDR  commissions  in  both  North 
and  South.  Each  of  these  commissions  was  charged  with  the  design  and 
implementation  of  the  demobilization  program  in  its  respective  region. 
The  UN  was  to  provide  financial  and  technical  support  through  several 
of  its  agencies,  principally  UNMIS.  The  multi-year  DDR  process  began 
in  Blue  Nile  State  in  mid-2005  with  a  group  of  more  than  5,600  elderly 
and  disabled  veterans  and  associated  children  and  women,  with  a  goal  of 
demobilizing  some  90,000  soldiers,  half  from  each  side.  This  number 
was  subsequently  raised  to  1 80,000,  again  evenly  split  between  North¬ 
ern  and  Southern  excombatants.  By  September  2010,  nearly  28,000  sol¬ 
diers  had  been  demobilized  according  to  UNMIS,  a  figure  that  had  risen 
to  38,440  by  January  2011 — more  than  27,000  of  them  from  the  North. 

The  War  in  Darfur,  2003-11 

Darfur  historically  has  been  one  of  Sudan’s  most  marginalized  and 
troublesome  regions,  being  a  meeting  ground  between  nomadic  Arabs 
in  the  North  and  African  agriculturalists  in  its  center  and  South.  Never¬ 
theless,  the  outbreak  of  the  February  2003  war  surprised  Washington, 


324 


National  Security 


other  Western  and  non- Western  countries,  and  international  organiza¬ 
tions  such  as  the  African  Union  and  the  United  Nations. 

Darfuris  have  long  felt  marginalized  by  the  central  government.  In 
2000,  their  grievances  were  starkly  enumerated  in  The  Black  Book: 
Imbalance  of  Power  and  Wealth  in  Sudan ,  allegedly  written  by  Darfiiri 
rebels.  The  book  documented  what  its  authors  said  was  the  near 
monopolization  of  positions  in  the  national  government  by  the  Arabs  of 
the  northern  Nile — a  dominance  that,  based  on  the  mid-1980s  ministe¬ 
rial  and  population  data,  for  example,  amounted  to  almost  69  percent  of 
positions,  or  “national  representation,”  on  the  part  of  Northerners,  who 
at  the  time  constituted  only  5.4  percent  of  the  national  population.  It 
was  this  dominance  that  constituted  one  of  the  major  grievances  of  the 
Darfuri  against  the  central  government  and  that  they  used  in  part  to  jus¬ 
tify  armed  rebellion. 

Additional  grievances  included  unequal  access  to  the  judicial  sys¬ 
tem,  poor  roads,  inadequate  schooling,  and  woefully  inferior  health  care. 
Resource  problems,  such  as  shrinking  pastureland,  chronic  drought,  and 
poor  cultivation  and  animal-breeding  practices,  facilitated  the  outbreak 
of  hostilities,  as  did  the  conviction  that  the  only  way  to  deal  with  the 
central  government  was  by  force,  as  the  Southerners  had  done. 

Khartoum’s  perspective  was  that  trouble  in  Darfur  had  nothing  to  do 
with  ethnic  problems  between  the  region’s  African  and  Arab  populations. 
According  to  the  government,  disputes  in  Darfur  had  always  been 
resolved  by  local  reconciliation  conferences.  The  al-Bashir  regime  main¬ 
tained  that  the  Darfur  war  occurred  because  Darfuri  rebels  “created  rela¬ 
tions  with  categories,  organizations,  and  societies  in  Europe,”  all  of  whom 
hoped  to  manipulate  the  Darfur  crisis  to  stir  up  trouble  for  Khartoum. 

The  main  combatants  included  the  rebel  Sudan  Liberation  Move¬ 
ment/Army  (SLM/A)  and  the  Justice  and  Equality  Movement  (JEM), 
but  there  also  were  a  proliferation  of  smaller  Darfur  rebel  groups. 
Members  of  sedentary  groups  belonged  to  the  non-Arab  Muslim 
Sudanese  population.  Their  adversaries  included  the  SAF  and  pro- 
government  militiamen  called  janjaweed ,  local  nomadic  Arabic¬ 
speaking  tribesmen  (Afro-Arabs),  most  of  whom  in  the  early  years  of 
the  conflict  were  Abbala  (camel  herders)  or  Baqqara  (cattle  herders). 

The  Darfur  war  began  on  February  26, 2003,  when  a  300-man  SLM/A 
force  attacked  the  garrison  town  of  Golu  in  West  Darfur  and  killed  some 
200  government  troops.  The  following  month,  SLM/A  rebels  captured 
Tini,  a  town  on  the  Chad-Sudan  border,  and  took  possession  of  the  garri¬ 
son’s  supply  of  weapons  and  ammunition.  On  April  25,  a  joint  SLM/A- 
JEM  force  assaulted  Nyala  and  the  Al-Fashir  airport,  where  the  rebels 
destroyed  helicopters,  killed  scores  of  government  troops,  and  seized 
weapons  and  vehicles.  In  May,  the  SLM/A  killed  about  500  soldiers  and 


325 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


seized  some  300  others.  Two  months  later,  a  second  SLM/A  operation 
resulted  in  the  deaths  of  about  250  soldiers.  On  August  1,  the  SLA/M 
occupied  Kutum,  a  town  northwest  of  Al-Fashir,  and  killed  members  of 
the  garrison.  On  September  4,  the  SLM/A  and  Khartoum  agreed  to  a 
cease-fire;  shortly  afterwards  each  side  accused  the  other  of  violating  the 
accord.  On  October  7,  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refu¬ 
gees  (UNHCR)  reported  that  more  than  $16  million  was  needed  to  care 
for  the  Sudanese  who  had  fled  to  Chad.  In  early  December,  janjaweed 
fighters  carried  out  numerous  raids  against  villages  in  Darfur,  killing 
untold  numbers  of  civilians  and  raping  a  great  many  women. 

The  janjaweed  intensified  their  attacks  during  a  one-week  period  in 
late  January  2004,  which  caused  some  18,000  refugees  to  flee  to  Chad. 
On  March  30,  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of 
Humanitarian  Affairs  (UNOCHA)  reported  that  daily  janjaweed  attacks 
had  occurred  across  Darfur.  A  few  days  later,  Jan  Egeland,  the  UN 
Security  Council  undersecretary-general,  reported  that  “a  scorched 
earth  coordinated  campaign  of  ethnic  cleansing”  was  affecting  parts  of 
Darfur.  Similar  reports  occurred  with  increasing  frequency  over  the 
next  months.  On  April  11,  Khartoum  and  the  SLM/A-JEM  agreed  to  a 
45-day  “humanitarian  cease-fire,”  which  permitted  the  deployment  of 
AU  observers  and  the  distribution  of  food  aid  to  hundreds  of  thousands 
of  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs).  However,  on  May  24,  the  cease¬ 
fire  ended  as  government  forces  and  rebels  blamed  each  other  for 
launching  attacks  on  a  village  south  of  Nyala  that  resulted  in  the  deaths 
of  45  civilians.  At  about  the  same  time,  the  UN  estimated  that  more 
than  1  million  of  Darfur’s  population  had  become  internally  displaced 
because  of  SAF -janjaweed  attacks.  Some  65,000  more  Darfuri  refu¬ 
gees  had  fled  to  Chad. 

UNHCR  reported  in  August  2004  that  some  1 .2  million  internally 
displaced  people  remained  in  Western  Sudan.  The  UN  World  Food 
Programme  attempted  to  provide  food  aid  to  some  800,000  conflict- 
affected  persons  in  Sudan  and  Chad  but  lack  of  security  and  seasonal 
rains  hampered  that  effort.  Chronic  instability  and  fighting  continued 
as  a  mainstay  of  life  in  the  region. 

U.S.  ambassador- at-large  for  war  crimes  Pierre  Prosper  reported  on 
June  24,  2004,  that  there  were  “indicators  of  genocide”  in  Darfur.  On 
July  3,  the  UN  and  Sudan  signed  a  joint  communique  that  required  the 
warring  parties  to  stop  fighting.  Khartoum  also  promised  to  disarm  the 
janjaweed ',  protect  IDP  camps,  punish  those  responsible  for  human- 
rights  violations,  resume  peace  talks  with  the  rebels,  and  facilitate  the 
distribution  of  humanitarian  aid.  Shortly  thereafter,  Sudan  deployed  a 
1,025-man  police  force  to  “maintain  security,  law,  and  order”  and  to 
“uphold  the  sense  of  nationhood.”  However,  on  July  18,  the  SLM/A-

JEM  withdrew  from  peace  talks  in  Addis  Ababa  until  SAF  forces 
withdrew  from  Darfur  and  disarmed  the  janjaweed. 

The  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  declared  the  Darfur  conflict  to  be 
a  genocide  on  July  22,  and  on  September  9,  Secretary  of  State  Colin 
Powell  claimed  that  “genocide  has  been  committed  in  Darfur.”  The  first 
contingent  of  the  expanded  AU  cease-fire  observation  force  arrived  in 
Darfur  on  October  28.  A  few  months  later,  AU  observers  reported  that 
the  Sudan  Air  Force  had  bombed  villages  in  South  Darfur  and  that  the 
security  situation  had  deteriorated  over  the  past  four  months.  In  January 
2006,  Physicians  for  Human  Rights  released  a  report  that  underscored 
the  genocidal  nature  of  the  Darfur  conflict.  The  following  June,  the 
International  Criminal  Court  reported  evidence  of  large-scale  massacres 
and  rapes  in  Darfur  to  the  United  Nations  Security  Council.  Meanwhile, 
on  May  5,  the  Sudanese  government  and  one  branch  of  the  SLM  signed 
what  they  termed  the  Darfur  Peace  Agreement,  which  brought  that 
group’s  leader,  Minni  Arkoi  Minnawi,  into  the  central  government  as  a 
senior  assistant  to  President  al-Bashir,  but  other  rebel  groups  refused  to 
join  the  agreement  and  continued  military  action.  Another  attempt  to 
make  peace  took  place  in  late  October  2007  in  Sirte,  Libya,  but  the  rebel 
groups  were  too  disunited  to  engage  in  serious  negotiations,  and  nothing 
was  accomplished. 

Beginning  in  the  second  half  of  2005,  concern  over  the  peace  talks 
grew  among  local  militias  and  paramilitaries  allied  with  the  govern¬ 
ment.  Their  concerns  were  borne  out  when  the  peace  agreement,  once 
signed,  committed  Khartoum  to  “neutralize  and  disarm  the  jcmjaweed- 
armed  militias”  as  a  first  step  to  peace.  Additionally,  the  government 
agreed  to  accept  5,000  rebels  into  the  regular  anny,  including  officers, 
with  training  for  another  3,000  men.  In  response,  some  militias  explored 
the  possibility  of  signing  their  own  agreements  with  rebel  groups.  Such 
agreements,  first  signed  in  2005,  ranged  from  military  alliances  with  the 
SLA  to  nonaggression  pacts  with  JEM.  Two  such  agreements  involved 
the  powerful  Mahamid  leader  of  North  Darfur,  Musa  Hilal,  and  the  mili¬ 
tia  chief  of  South  Darfur,  Muhammad  Hamdan.  In  March  2006,  Ham- 
dan  signed  a  mutual  nonaggression  agreement  with  JEM;  two  months 
later,  Musa  Hilal  did  the  same.  Another  agreement  involving  segments 


327 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


of  the  Mahamid  and  Mahariyya  militias  resulted  in  these  militiamen 
becoming  fully  integrated  into  the  SLA  in  pursuit  of  demands  from  the 
government  for  security  and  services  for  nomads,  including  hospitals 
and  schools. 

Violence  continued  in  Darfur  after  2007,  although  at  a  significantly 
reduced  level.  In  May  2008,  in  a  show  of  strength,  JEM  fighters  launched 
a  daring  raid  on  Khartoum,  fighting  their  way  into  Omdurman  before 
being  turned  back.  Peace  negotiations  resumed  in  2009,  hosted  by  Qatar. 
The  talks  led  to  a  cease-fire  in  February  2010  between  the  government 
and  JEM,  with  a  tentative  agreement  to  pursue  further  peace  initiatives, 
although  such  proposals  soon  faltered  over  accusations  of  government 
raids.  A  protocol  on  border  security  that  Chad  and  Sudan  signed  in  Janu¬ 
ary  2010  reopened  the  border  for  the  first  time  since  2003  and  established 
a  3,000-man  joint  border-patrol  force,  provisions  that  contributed  to  sta¬ 
bility  in  Darfur.  Even  so,  renewed  fighting  between  government  forces 
and  JEM  and  SLM  led  the  UN’s  secretary-general,  Ban  Ki-moon,  to 
point  out  in  early  2011  that  efforts  toward  peace  remained  frustrated  by 
the  fragmentation  of  Darfur’s  armed  groups  and  by  ongoing  conflict, 
which  continued  to  uproot  civilians  and  cause  further  suffering  for  the 
people  of  the  region. 

The  UN  estimated  that  as  of  January  2011,  at  least  300,000  people 
had  been  killed,  and  more  than  2  million  had  been  driven  from  their 
homes  since  the  war  erupted  in  February  2003.  The  Sudanese  govern¬ 
ment,  however,  disputed  these  figures,  particularly  the  number  of  those 
killed,  maintaining  that  only  10,000  had  died.  In  either  case,  some  ana¬ 
lysts  distinguished  between  those  killed  as  a  result  of  direct  military 
action  or  as  a  result  of  intercommunal  strife. 

Despite  the  number  of  armed  groups  in  Darfur,  most  of  the  interna¬ 
tional  community  blamed  the  Sudanese  government  for  the  war  and  the 
atrocities  associated  with  it.  This  sentiment  was  formally  expressed  on 
March  4,  2009,  when  the  International  Criminal  Court  (ICC),  seated  in 
The  Hague  in  the  Netherlands,  issued  an  arrest  warrant  for  President  al- 
Bashir  on  five  counts  of  crimes  against  humanity  (murder,  extermina¬ 
tion,  forcible  transfer,  torture,  and  rape)  and  two  counts  of  war  crimes 
(pillaging,  and  directing  attacks  against  civilians)  as  a  result  of  his  poli¬ 
cies  in  Darfur  between  March  2003  and  July  2008.  The  warrants  resulted 
in  a  split  of  world  opinion,  with  the  United  States  and  many  Western 
governments  supporting  the  ICC  move,  while  other  African  and  Arab 
countries  as  well  as  China  denounced  the  decision.  The  court  had  earlier 
issued  indictments  for  violations  of  human  rights  against  two  other 
Sudanese  government  officials,  and  in  November  2008,  it  had  issued 
indictments  for  war  crimes  against  three  leaders  of  Darfiiri  militias  for 
attacks  on  UN  peacekeepers.  One  of  the  Darfiiris  voluntarily  answered  a 


328 


National  Security 


court  summons  in  May  2009,  but  none  of  the  government  officials  did; 
indeed,  al-Bashir  denounced  the  tribunal  and  refused  to  recognize  the 
validity  of  the  arrest  warrant  issued  against  him. 

AU  and  UN  Forces  in  Darfur 

The  outbreak  of  the  Darfur  war  in  February  2003  prompted  the 
international  community  to  create  the  African  Union  Mission  in  Sudan 
(AMIS)  as  a  way  to  end  the  conflict.  The  African  Union  approved  the 
deployment  of  120  unarmed  monitors  to  oversee  a  cease-fire  that  was 
never  implemented.  Subsequently,  the  AU  approved  the  deployment 
of  an  additional  300  armed  troops  from  Nigeria  and  Rwanda  to  protect 
the  monitors.  The  European  Union  provided  12  million  euros  to  sup¬ 
port  the  deployment. 

AMIS  was  charged  with  several  tasks.  It  was  to  implement  the  April 
2004  cease-fire  between  the  JEM,  the  SLA,  and  government  forces; 
establish  safe  routes  for  combatants  returning  to  their  homes;  assess 
requirements  for  mine-clearing  operations;  and  adjudicate  and  then 
report  cease-fire  violations  to  AU  headquarters  in  Addis  Ababa.  Unfor¬ 
tunately,  these  tasks  were  beyond  the  capabilities  of  the  AU  and  AMIS. 
By  October  2004,  there  were  only  80  monitors  in  Darfur.  Attempts  to 
facilitate  a  lasting  cease-fire  failed;  safe  routes  were  problematic;  inad¬ 
equate  manpower  hampered  mine  clearance;  and  adjudication  of  cease¬ 
fires  was  spotty  because  AMIS  reports  sent  to  AU  headquarters  were 
months  out  of  date  and  consequently  of  no  use  to  those  trying  to  moni¬ 
tor  current  military  developments  in  Darfur. 

That  same  month,  the  AU  agreed  to  establish  AMIS  II,  a  new  moni¬ 
toring  group  that  would  consist  of  450  observers,  641  unarmed  troops, 
1,700  protection  force  troops,  815  civilian  police,  and  a  164-man  civil¬ 
ian  support  staff.  Although  AMIS  II  was  a  significant  improvement 
over  the  prior  force,  its  numbers  were  still  woefully  inadequate  for  the 
task  of  stabilizing  Darfur,  a  region  about  the  size  of  France.  In  late 
October  2004,  the  United  States  began  airlifting  troops  from  Nigeria 
and  Rwanda  to  Al-Fashir,  while  Germany  agreed  to  provide  logistical 
support  to  AMIS  II.  In  November,  South  Africa  agreed  to  deploy  an 
infantry  company,  an  ordnance  disposal  team,  and  additional  observers 
and  staff  officers. 

The  international  community  welcomed  these  advances,  but  Dar¬ 
fur’s  security  situation  remained  perilous.  AMIS  II  functioned  poorly 
because  of  understaffing,  poor  infrastructure,  an  unclear  mandate,  and 
the  unwillingness  of  government  and  rebel  forces  to  end  the  fighting.  As 
a  result,  in  April  2005,  the  AU  approved  the  establishment  of  AMIS  III. 
Authorized  personnel  levels  expanded  from  3,600  to  7,800,  including 
700  military  observers;  5,500  troops;  and  1,600  civilian  police,  but  even

this  expanded  force  proved  unable  to  police  Darfur  or  to  defend  itself. 
On  April  15,  2007,  rebel  troops  attacked  and  killed  some  AU  peace¬ 
keepers.  On  September  30,  2007,  a  more  serious  incident  occurred  in 
which  rebels  overran  an  AMIS  base,  killing  10  peacekeepers. 

In  view  of  continued  raiding  and  killing,  UN  secretary-general  Kofi 
Annan  called  for  deployment  of  an  18,000-man  peacekeeping  force  to 
replace  the  AU  contingent.  On  August  3 1 ,  2006,  the  UN  Security  Coun¬ 
cil  adopted  a  resolution  to  deploy  17,300  troops  to  Darfur.  The  Sudanese 
government  adamantly  opposed  this  action,  and  it  was  not  until  July  31, 
2007,  after  difficult  negotiations  with  Sudan,  that  the  UN  announced  that 
a  joint  UN-Affican  Union  force  projected  at  26,000  soldiers  and  police 
officers  would  replace  AMIS  by  December  3 1 .  At  Sudanese  insistence, 
the  force  was  to  be  composed  mostly  of  African  troops,  the  first  units  of 
which  joined  the  beleaguered  peacekeepers  already  in  Darfur  in  early 
January  2008.  This  joint  force,  the  United  Nations-African  Union  Mis¬ 
sion  in  Darfur  (UNAMID),  numbered  almost  7,500  by  mid-March  and 
was  expected  to  reach  full  strength  by  the  end  of  2008,  but  like  the 
AMIS  mission,  it  was  so  short  of  communications  and  logistics  equip¬ 
ment  as  well  as  personnel  that  prospects  for  its  success  were  in  doubt. 

Nonetheless,  UNAMID’s  strength  rose  until  it  stood  at  22,061  mili¬ 
tary  personnel  in  October  2010  and  at  23,096  uniformed  personnel  on 
July  31,  2011,  a  force  that  included  17,759  troops,  4,526  police  offi¬ 
cers,  311  military  observers,  plus  UN  civilian  staff.  They  were  sup¬ 
ported  by  more  than  4,000  civilians.  With  its  mandate  extended  to  July 
2012,  it  was  the  largest  peacekeeping  mission  in  the  world.  By  then, 
the  intensity  of  conflict  between  nomadic  Arab  pastoralists  on  the  one 
hand  and  fanners  from  the  Fur,  Masalit,  and  Zaghawa  communities  on 
the  other  had  declined  measurably  from  levels  of  fighting  in  the  early 
years  of  the  war. 

The  Sudan  Armed  Forces 

The  military  services  of  the  national  government  are  known  as  the 
Sudan  Armed  Forces  (SAF).  As  of  2010,  the  SAF’s  personnel  strength 
was  more  than  109,000,  plus  associated  militias.  Men  and  women 
aged  18-30  years  were  subject  to  compulsory  military  service  for  two 
years,  although  some  sources  suggested  the  term  of  service  was  three 
years.  The  army  numbered  105,000  officers  and  enlisted  men.  The 
navy  had  an  estimated  1,300  men,  and  the  air  force  had  a  complement 
of  about  3,000.  Paramilitary  units  totaled  102,500  security  personnel. 

Lieutenant  General  Umar  Hassan  Ahmed  al-Bashir,  Sudan’s  presi¬ 
dent  since  the  June  1989  coup,  was  also  commander  in  chief  of  the  SAF 
and  the  Popular  Defense  Forces  (PDF),  a  paramilitary  reserve  compo¬ 
nent  of  the  SAF.  The  National  Defense  Council,  which  was  responsible 


330 


National  Security 


for  planning,  operated  through  the  Ministry  of  Defense.  By  early  2008, 
General  Abd  al-Rahim  Muhammad  Husayn  served  as  the  minister  of 
defense  and  was  still  in  this  post  in  201 1.  The  SAF  chief  of  staff  was  in 
immediate  command  of  the  armed  forces.  The  general  stalf  also  included 
the  army  chief  of  staff  and  his  three  deputy  chiefs  of  staff,  one  each  for 
operations,  administration,  and  logistics,  who  held  the  rank  of  lieutenant 
general.  The  commander  of  the  air  force,  the  commander  of  air  defense 
forces,  division  commanders,  and  most  military  governors  held  the  rank 
of  major  general.  The  actual  responsibilities  and  influence  of  senior  offi¬ 
cers  depended  greatly  on  their  political  status,  ethnic  affiliation,  and 
other  factors  in  addition  to  their  positions  in  the  chain  of  command. 

In  February  2004,  Sudan  joined  12  regional  states  to  form  the  East 
African  Standby  Brigade  (EASBRIG)  of  the  African  Union’s  planned 
African  Standby  Force.  Other  members  in  2008  were  Burundi,  Comoros, 
Djibouti,  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  Kenya,  Madagascar,  Mauritius,  Rwanda,  Sey¬ 
chelles,  Somalia,  Tanzania,  and  Uganda.  The  brigade  was  intended  for 
rapid  military  deployment  in  East  Africa  and  the  Horn  in  situations  requir¬ 
ing  observer  missions  and  peacekeeping.  It  had  been  expected  to  reach 
interim  operational  capability  by  mid-2010  but  its  formation  was  behind 
schedule. 

Army 

The  Sudan  Army,  in  early  2011  numbering  105,000  personnel,  was 
a  light  infantry  force  supported  by  specialized  elements.  The  main 
army  units  included  one  armored  division,  one  mechanized  infantry 
division  and  one  independent  brigade,  six  infantry  divisions  and  seven 
independent  infantry  brigades,  three  artillery  brigades,  one  reconnais¬ 
sance  brigade,  one  airborne  division,  one  engineers  division,  one  bor¬ 
der  guard  brigade,  and  five  special  forces  companies. 

The  al-Numayri  government  introduced  compulsory  military  service 
in  1972.  The  army  was  conscript-based,  and  all  males  aged  18  to  30 
were  subject  to  two  years  of  compulsory  national  service.  In  1989  the 
law  was  revised.  In  1992  the  al-Bashir  regime  introduced  the  National 
Service  Law,  which  contained  a  religious  and  ideological  agenda  that 
sought  to  instil  recruits  with  the  “spirit  of  jihad,”  disseminate  the  “mod¬ 
els  of  martyrs,”  reject  the  “spirit  of  relaxation,”  and  promote  discipline. 
Evasion  was  commonplace,  however,  and  the  army  frequently  resorted 
to  roundups  of  males  in  major  cities.  Normally,  there  were  some  20,000 
conscripts  in  the  army  and  another  5,000  in  training. 

Operational  control  extended  from  general  staff  headquarters  in  Khar¬ 
toum  to  the  six  regional  commands  (central,  eastern,  western,  northern, 
southern,  and  Khartoum),  each  of  which  comprised  three  infantry  bri¬ 
gades.  Each  regional  command  was  organized  along  divisional  lines. 


331 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Thus,  the  Fifth  Division  was  at  Al-Obeid  in  Kordofan  (Central  Com¬ 
mand),  the  Second  Division  was  at  Khashm  al-Qirbah  (Eastern  Com¬ 
mand),  the  Sixth  Division  was  assigned  to  Al-Fashir  in  Darfur  (Western 
Command),  the  First  Division  was  formerly  (before  the  CPA)  at  Juba 
(Southern  Command),  and  the  Seventh  Armored  Division  was  at  Ash 
Shajarah  near  Khartoum  (Khartoum  Command).  The  Airborne  Division 
was  stationed  at  Khartoum  International  Airport.  The  Third  Division  was 
based  in  the  North,  although  no  major  troop  units  were  assigned  to  it. 
Each  division  had  a  liaison  officer  attached  to  Khartoum  general  head¬ 
quarters  to  facilitate  the  division's  communication  with  various  command 
elements.  The  PDF  and  an  assortment  of  tribal  and  rebel  militias  sup¬ 
ported  SAF  operations  in  Darfur,  as  they  formerly  did  in  South  Sudan. 

The  army  lacked  a  general  headquarters  and  functioned  under  the 
deputy  chief  of  staff  for  operations.  Headquarters  and  training  facili¬ 
ties  were  near  Khartoum  for  most  specialized  corps.  These  included 
the  armored,  artillery,  signal,  and  medical  service  administrations;  the 
transportation  and  supply  corps;  and  the  engineers  division.  Support 
elements  included  the  military  police,  the  brigade  of  border  guards, 
and  the  general  armories. 

The  army’s  inventory  of  armaments  reflected  its  shifting  military 
relations  with  other  nations  that  sold  or  supplied  weapons.  At  different 
times,  Belarus,  Britain,  China,  Egypt,  Iran,  Libya,  Poland,  Russia,  and 
the  United  States  have  provided  training  and  weapons  to  the  army  (see 
table  4,  Appendix).  Prior  to  the  exploitation  of  Sudan’s  oil  reserves, 
much  military  equipment  delivered  to  Sudan  had  fallen  into  disrepair  or 
had  become  obsolete.  Moreover,  Sudan  lacked  the  foreign  exchange  to 
pay  for  maintenance  and  spare  parts,  a  situation  that  reduced  the  army’s 
military  capabilities.  During  the  1980s  and  the  early  2000s,  some  army 
units  lacked  such  basics  as  food,  ammunition,  fuel,  and  health  care. 

Sudan  continued  to  rely  on  foreign  loans  to  purchase  military  equip¬ 
ment  despite  its  growing  oil  wealth.  In  March  2005,  China  and  Russia 
approved  UN  Resolution  1591,  which  banned  Sudan  from  making  weap¬ 
ons  transfers  to  Darfur  without  the  Security  Council’s  permission,  but 
both  nations  failed  to  honor  this  obligation.  In  2005,  for  example,  Sudan 
imported  $83  million  worth  of  military  hardware  from  China  and  $37.4 
million  from  Russia,  both  of  which  denied  selling  arms  to  Khartoum.  In 
October  2006,  Sudan  asked  Russia  for  a  $1  billion  military  equipment 
loan  to  purchase  more  aircraft.  In  2007  China  and  Russia  broke  a  United 
Nations  arms  embargo  by  supplying  Sudan  with  attack  helicopters, 
bombers,  and  other  weapons  for  use  against  civilians  in  Darfur.  Addition¬ 
ally,  Chinese  aircraft  and  Russian  helicopter  gunships  were  photographed 
at  three  Darfur  airports.  China  also  sold  six  K-8  training  aircraft  to 
Sudan's  air  force,  which  could  be  used  for  ground  attack  missions.  Subse¬ 
quently,  Sudan  purchased  another  six  K-8s.

Air  Force 

The  3,000-man  Sudan  Air  Force  had  two  main  bases,  which  were 
located  at  Khartoum  International  Airport  and  at  Wadi  Sayyidna  Air 
Base  north  of  Omdunnan.  Other  air  bases  were  at  Al-Fashir,  Al-Junay- 
nah,  Juba,  Kassala,  Khashm  al-Qirbah,  Kosti,  Nyala,  Port  Sudan,  and 
Al-Obeid.  The  air  force  historically  suffered  from  poor  maintenance 
and  a  lack  of  investment  in  new  aircraft.  As  a  result,  the  operability  of 
most  aircraft  was  low  despite  the  fact  that  foreign  technicians  periodi¬ 
cally  provided  maintenance  assistance.  Iraqi  and  Iranian  technicians 
were  employed  through  the  1990s.  More  recently,  Russian  firms  were 
expected  to  provide  maintenance,  support  technicians,  and  spare  parts. 
By  the  mid-2000s,  Sudan’s  air  arm  was  assigned  to  support  land  forces, 
particularly  in  fighting  rebel  forces  in  the  South  and  West  of  the  coun¬ 
try.  Before  2005,  counterinsurgency  operations  focused  primarily  on 
Juba  and  since  then  on  Darfur. 

Combat  aircraft  included  MiG-29SE  Fulcrums;  A-5C  Fantans;  and 
SU-25  Frogfoots.  Sudan  also  had  numerous  helicopters  in  its  inven¬ 
tory,  including  Mi-24  Hinds,  Mi-1 7 Is;  and  an  array  of  transport  air¬ 
craft,  including  C-130H  Hercules,  An-26  “Curls,”  An-30  Clanks,  An- 
74TKs,  and  SAC  Y-8s  (see  table  5,  Appendix). 

The  inventory  did  not  include  “bombers,”  but  the  air  force  employed 
its  few  light  turboprop  transport  An-26  Curls  to  drop  oil  drums  filled 
with  explosives,  although  targeting  was  very  poor  and  resulted  in  little 
damage.  Nevertheless,  anti-Khartoum  activists  constantly  reported  that 
“waves  of  bombers”  regularly  attacked  targets  during  the  wars  in  Darfur 
and  South  Sudan;  however,  most  credible  observers  discounted  these 
reports.  The  air  force  had  some  helicopter  gunships,  which  could  inflict 
limited  damage  on  small  groups  of  rebels.  Aerial  attacks,  however  inef¬ 
fective,  usually  caused  villagers  to  flee  their  homes.  In  that  sense,  air 
power  was  a  useful  psychological  weapon. 

The  Air  Defense  Command  maintained  its  headquarters  at  Port 
Sudan  and  a  secondary  command  post  in  Omdurman.  One  of  its  two 
brigades  was  equipped  with  antiaircraft  guns,  and  the  other  was  armed 
with  surface-to-air  missiles  (SAMs).  The  SA-2  SAM  battalions  were 
introduced  to  provide  high-  and  medium-altitude  air  defense  for  Port 
Sudan,  Wadi  Sayyidna,  and  Khartoum.  During  the  1970s,  technicians 
regularly  serviced  the  missiles  and  associated  radar,  but  the  current 
operability  of  these  weapons  was  doubtful. 

The  other  air  defense  brigade  was  deployed  to  the  Western  Command 
and  the  Southern  Command  to  provide  tactical  air  defense.  Its  inventory 
fonnerly  included  U.S.-supplied  Vulcan  20mm  self-propelled  guns  and 
other  weapons.  France,  Egypt,  and  the  United  States  formerly  provided 
fire  control  and  acquisition  radar  and  other  systems.  The  Air  Defense 


333 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Command  performed  poorly  in  the  past,  as  evidenced  by  a  1984  daylight 
attack  by  a  Libyan  Tu-22  bomber  that  dropped  bombs  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  national  radio  station  at  Omdurman  at  a  time  of  tension  between  al- 
Numayri  and  al-Qadhafi.  The  current  status  of  the  Air  Defense  Com¬ 
mand  was  unknown  in  2011,  but  most  observers  believed  that  the  unit 
might  no  longer  be  operational. 

Navy 

The  Sudan  Navy,  formed  in  1962,  is  the  smallest  branch  of  the  coun¬ 
try’s  military  establishment.  Yugoslavia  helped  create  the  navy  by  trans¬ 
ferring  four  armed  coastal  patrol  boats,  river  patrol  boats,  landing  craft, 
and  auxiliary  vessels.  Until  1972,  there  also  was  a  Yugoslav  training 
staff  in  Sudan.  In  1975  two  70-ton  patrol  craft  and  four  10-ton  patrol 
craft,  transferred  from  Iran  and  armed  with  machine  guns,  replaced  the 
Yugoslav  patrol  boats.  In  April  1993,  Sudan  and  Egypt  terminated 
naval-training  agreements.  Since  then,  Cairo  has  reported  the  presence 
of  Iranian  naval  advisers.  There  also  have  been  reports  that  Islamic  Rev¬ 
olutionary  Guard  Corps  personnel,  in  addition  to  regular  Iranian  offi¬ 
cers,  were  involved  in  training.  By  the  late  1990s,  Iranian  personnel  had 
returned  home. 

The  navy’s  personnel  strength  was  an  estimated  1,300  officers  and 
enlisted  personnel  with  1 5  inshore  vessels  in  early  2011.  The  service 
was  divided  into  two  commands.  The  Red  Sea  Command,  headquar¬ 
tered  at  Port  Sudan,  was  responsible  for  coastal  defense  and  for  deter¬ 
ring  smuggling  along  the  Red  Sea  coast,  and  the  Nile  River  Command, 
headquartered  at  Khartoum,  was  responsible  for  patrolling  the  Nile. 
Aside  from  headquarters,  the  navy  also  maintained  bases  at  Flamingo 
Bay  on  the  Red  Sea  and  at  Kosti  on  the  White  Nile  south  of  Khartoum. 

The  naval  inventory  included  the  15  inshore  patrol  craft  (four 
Kurmuk  and  four  Sewart  class,  all  under  100  tonnes  each,  and  seven 
armed  patrol  boats),  plus  seven  amphibious  landing  craft,  two  of  them 
Sobat  tank-capable  craft  and  five  for  personnel  and  vehicles  (see  table 
6,  Appendix).  The  lack  of  maintenance  and  spare  parts  undermined 
the  navy’s  capabilities.  Auxiliary  vessels  reportedly  were  in  a  state  of 
disrepair. 

Personnel 

The  SAF’s  personnel  needs  did  not  strain  the  nation's  manpower 
resources.  According  to  U.S.  government  estimates,  in  2010  there  were 
10.3  million  males  between  the  ages  of  16  and  49,  of  whom  6  million 
were  fit  for  military  service.  The  number  reaching  the  military  age  of 
18  annually  was  about  500,000.  Females  available  for  military  service 


334 


National  Security 


totaled  9.9  million,  while  those  fit  for  duty  totaled  6.2  million.  Women 
who  reached  military  service  age  annually  totaled  about  490,000. 

After  independence,  recruitment  notices  attracted  10  applicants  for 
each  vacancy.  Poorer  Sudanese,  particularly  Southerners  and  Westerners, 
joined  the  SAF  in  great  numbers.  Selection  of  enlisted  troops  depended 
on  the  applicants’  character,  education,  physical  condition,  and  ability  to 
read  and  write.  A  good  record  enabled  them  to  reenlist  for  ftirther  three- 
year  periods  until  they  had  served  20  years,  at  which  time  a  soldier  retired 
at  his/her  highest  rank.  Soldiers  who  received  technical  training  could  be 
required  to  sign  up  for  a  nine-year  tour.  In  the  late  1980s,  SAF  morale 
suffered  as  many  soldiers  disliked  serving  in  the  South  because  of  food 
shortages,  lack  of  supplies,  and  the  seemingly  endless  fighting.  Some 
SAF  troops  who  had  homes  in  the  South  defected  to  the  SPLM/A. 

Sources  have  conveyed  varied  accounts  of  current  conscription 
practices.  According  to  a  January  2007  British  government  report, 
Sudan's  recruitment  and  conscription  practices  involve  “the  relevant 
authority  putting  an  advertisement  in  the  local  media  calling  for  young 
people  to  sign  up.”  A  January  2005  Report  of  the  International  Commis¬ 
sion  of  Inquiry  on  Darfur  to  the  United  Nations  Secretary-General  noted  that 
local  tribal  leaders  and  sheikhs  helped  mobilize  and  recruit  conscripts 
into  the  PDF  forces.  A  senior  PDF  commander,  cited  in  the  report, 
stated  that  military  training  in  each  state  took  place  locally  and  that 
basic  training,  including  use  of  weapons  and  discipline,  took  approxi¬ 
mately  two  weeks.  According  to  this  report,  PDF  conscripts  were  even¬ 
tually  integrated  into  the  SAF. 

The  report  noted  that  in  2005,  Sudan  forcibly  conscripted  Sudanese 
citizens  for  national  military  service.  The  report  also  alleged  that  the 
PDF  conscripted  teenagers  from  government-run  “reformation  camps” 
established  for  “vagrant”  children.  These  conscripts  allegedly  experi¬ 
enced  "hardship  and  abuse"  during  military  service.  A  May  15,  2006, 
article  in  Sudan’s  Al-Watan  newspaper  reported  that  there  had  been  pro¬ 
tests  about  conscription  and  desertions  of  conscripts  at  national  service 
camps.  The  article  also  noted  that  conscripts  had  protested  against 
“mistreatment  by  the  trainers  and  harshness  of  the  training  routine.” 
According  to  a  2006  UN  report  on  children  and  armed  conflict  in 
Sudan,  two  recruits  died  during  military  training  in  Darfur. 

The  actions  of  SAF  troops  and  of  Southern  and  Darfuri  rebels  were 
often  excessive.  Human-rights  organizations  such  as  Amnesty  Interna¬ 
tional  and  Africa  Watch  have  long  reported  on  the  heavy-handed  tactics 
of  combatants  on  all  sides.  Execution  of  prisoners  was  commonplace  in 
the  SAF  and  the  SPLM/A.  The  ongoing  Darfur  war  was  a  human-rights 
catastrophe.  Forced  removal  of  noncombatants,  rapes,  torture,  and  indis¬ 
criminate  killing  characterized  much  of  the  fighting.  All  sides  in  that 
conflict  committed  widespread  human-rights  violations. 


335 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Every  annual  U.S.  Department  of  State  human-rights  report  states  that 
all  Sudanese  governments  since  independence  have  had  “poor”  human- 
rights  records  and  have  engaged  in  varying  degrees  of  human-rights  viola¬ 
tions.  However,  much  of  the  international  community  remained  silent 
about  the  SPLM/A’s  excesses.  In  February  1984,  for  example,  the  SPLMZ 
A  killed  some  1 50  passengers  on  a  Nile  steamer,  an  attack  that  halted  all  rail 
and  river  transport  in  the  South,  and,  in  August  1986,  shot  down  a  Sudan 
Airways  aircraft  near  Malakal,  killing  60  passengers  and  crew.  In  June 
2001,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  Sudan  estimated  that  an  SPLM/A 
attack  in  West  Bahr  al-Ghazal  had  displaced  some  57,000  people.  Ironi¬ 
cally,  at  about  the  same  time,  SPLM/A  commander  John  Garang  accused 
Khartoum  of  being  a  “terrorist  state”  and  of  committing  “gross  human- 
rights  violations.”  Meanwhile,  Garang  described  himself  as  a  “freedom 
fighter”  and  the  SPLM/A  as  a  “human-rights  movement.”  He  also  dis¬ 
missed  allegations  of  SPLM/A  human-rights  violations  and  characterized 
them  as  “mistakes  that  happen.” 

Training 

The  SAF  trained  its  personnel  in  several  institutions.  The  Sudan  Mil¬ 
itary  College  at  Wadi  Sayyidna  was  the  premier  institution  for  officers 
since  its  opening  in  1948.  After  graduating  from  a  two-year  political  and 
military  science  program,  a  cadet  received  a  commission  as  a  second 
lieutenant  in  the  SAF.  In  the  late  1950s,  some  60  cadets  graduated  each 
year.  In  1972,  after  the  outbreak  of  the  first  civil  war  in  the  South,  500 
cadets  passed  through  the  Sudan  Military  College.  In  the  late  1970s  and 
early  1980s,  some  120-150  officers  graduated  each  year.  Students  from 
other  Arab  and  African  countries  also  trained  there.  In  1982,  for  exam¬ 
ple,  60  Ugandans  graduated  from  the  Sudan  Military  College  as  part 
Khartoum’s  effort  to  help  rebuild  the  Ugandan  Army  after  Idi  Amin’s 
downfall.  In  1990  about  600  NIF  members  attended  the  Sudan  Military 
College  to  help  fill  the  ranks  of  the  officer  corps  depleted  by  resigna¬ 
tions  or  dismissals. 

The  Sudan  Military  College’s  course  of  study  had  the  reputation  of 
being  weak  in  scientific  and  technical  instruction.  On  a  more  positive 
note,  however,  the  SAF  allowed  junior  officers  to  continue  their  education 
at  the  University  of  Khartoum.  Many  SAF  officers  also  studied  abroad  in 
Britain,  Egypt,  Germany,  the  United  States,  and  numerous  Middle  Eastern 
countries.  After  independence,  most  senior  naval  officers  trained  at  the 
Yugoslav  naval  academy,  while  midlevel  officers  attended  courses  in  sev¬ 
eral  Persian  Gulf  countries. 

Since  the  early  1970s,  the  Staff  College  in  Omdurman  has  graduated 
55  to  60  majors  and  lieutenant  colonels  annually  with  a  master’s  degree 
in  military  science.  Officers  from  Jordan,  Kuwait,  and  the  United  Arab

National  Security 


Emirates  as  well  as  some  Palestinians  also  attended  the  Staff  College. 
Since  1981,  Sudan’s  war  college,  the  High  Military  Academy  in  Omdur- 
man,  offered  a  six-month  course  on  national  security  issues  to  prepare 
colonels  and  brigadier  generals  for  more  senior  positions. 

The  SAF  also  operated  several  technical  schools  for  junior  and 
noncommissioned  officers,  including  artillery,  communications,  engi¬ 
neering,  infantry,  ordnance,  and  armored  schools,  all  of  which  were 
located  in  Khartoum.  An  air  force  training  center  at  Wadi  Sayyinda 
Air  Base  trained  technicians  in  aircraft  maintenance,  ground  control, 
and  other  skills. 

No  detailed  current  information  about  training  in  the  SAF  was 
available  in  the  early  2000s.  Nonetheless,  the  institutions  mentioned 
above  remained  active,  and  most  of  them  upgraded  their  courses  to 
stay  abreast  of  advances  in  military  science  and  training.  Limited 
numbers  of  foreign  officers  from  the  Middle  East  and  Gulf  states  con¬ 
tinued  to  attend  Sudan’s  military  schools.  The  High  Military  Academy 
also  continued  to  produce  strategic  reports  for  senior  SAF  officers. 

Defense  Expenditures 

Little  information  was  available  about  Sudan’s  defense  expenditures. 
Reliable  estimates  of  the  defense  budget  in  Western  military  sources 
varied  from  1 .3  percent  to  3  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in 
recent  years.  Oil  revenues  enabled  Khartoum  to  increase  defense  spend¬ 
ing;  for  example,  the  defense  budget  was  estimated  to  have  risen  from 
US$405  million  in  2003  to  US$500  million  in  2006,  in  large  part  in 
response  to  rising  oil  revenues.  Actual  defense  outlays,  however,  almost 
certainly  exceeded  these  figures. 

Although  the  specific  components  of  military  spending  were  not 
available,  it  was  generally  agreed  that  the  principal  category  of  the 
defense  budget  was  personnel-related  costs.  Historically,  most  large  arms 
purchases  were  financed  with  credits  from  the  supplying  countries,  prin¬ 
cipally  China,  Iran,  Russia,  Ukraine,  and  some  Arab  countries.  However, 
in  recent  years,  Sudan’s  growing  oil  wealth  has  enabled  the  al-Bashir 
regime  to  finance  an  increasing  number  of  weapons  purchases.  Funding 
for  military  procurement  was  available  through  loans,  grants,  direct  pur¬ 
chases,  and  barter  arrangements. 

The  Sudanese  People’s  Liberation  Movement/ 
Army 

John  Garang  de  Mabior,  a  Dinka  bom  into  a  Christian  family,  earned  a 
B.A.  degree  in  economics  from  Grinnell  College,  Iowa.  He  then  attended 
the  University  of  Dar  es  Salaam.  Garang  returned  to  the  United  States, 


337 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


where  he  attended  a  company  commanders’  course  at  Fort  Benning, 
Georgia.  Subsequently,  he  received  an  M.A.  and  a  Ph.D.  in  economics 
from  Iowa  State  University. 

The  SPLM/A  formed  in  1983  when  Garang,  then  a  lieutenant  colonel 
in  the  SAF,  was  sent  to  Bor  to  quell  a  mutiny  of  500  Southern  troops  who 
refused  to  be  rotated  to  the  North.  Instead  of  ending  the  mutiny,  Garang 
encouraged  mutinies  in  other  garrisons  and  assumed  leadership  of  the 
Southern  rebellion.  By  1986,  the  SPLM/A  had  an  estimated  12,500 
troops  organized  into  12  battalions  and  equipped  with  small  arms  and  a 
few  mortars.  SPLM/A  recmits  received  training  in  Ethiopia.  By  1989, 
the  SPLM/A's  strength  had  reached  20,000  to  30,000;  by  1991  it  was 
estimated  at  50,000  to  60,000.  Many  SPLM/A  members  continued  their 
civilian  occupations,  serving  in  individual  campaigns  when  called  upon. 
By  then,  at  least  40  battalions  had  been  formed,  bearing  such  names  as 
Tiger,  Crocodile,  Fire,  Nile,  Kalashnikov,  Bee,  Eagle,  and  Hippo. 

Apart  from  Garang,  other  senior  officers  included  a  field  commander, 
a  chief  of  staff,  and  a  chief  of  staff  for  administration  and  logistics.  Most 
officers,  as  well  as  zonal  commanders,  held  the  rank  of  lieutenant  colo¬ 
nel,  while  captains  or  majors  served  as  battalion  commanders.  Promotion 
was  based  on  seniority  and  number  of  battles  fought.  Most  senior  leaders 
and  field  commanders  belonged  to  the  Dinka  group,  a  situation  that  many 
non-Dinka  groups  resented,  particularly  those  who  were  Nuer  or  Shilluk. 

The  SPLM/A  claimed  that,  during  its  early  years,  its  arms  came  from 
captured  government  stocks  or  were  brought  by  troops  deserting  from  the 
SAF.  However,  Garang  admitted  to  receiving  a  considerable  amount  of 
support  and  materiel  from  Libya  before  1985  because  of  Libyan  hostility 
toward  al-Numayri.  The  SPLM/A,  which  had  bases  in  Ethiopia,  denied 
receiving  arms  from  Addis  Ababa,  but  such  denials  were  highly  improba¬ 
ble.  Ethiopia  wanted  to  weaken  the  Sudanese  government,  and  the  only 
way  to  achieve  this  goal  was  to  supply  the  SPLM/A  with  cash  and  weap¬ 
ons.  The  SPLM/A’s  weapons  inventory  included  U.S.,  German,  and  Soviet 
assault  rifles.  The  SPLM/A  also  reportedly  had  60mm  mortars,  14.5mm 
antiaircraft  guns,  and  Soviet  SA-7  shoulder-fired  SAMs.  Other  sources 
claimed  that  the  SPLM/A  had  acquired  howitzers,  heavier  mortars,  BM-21 
truck-mounted  rocket  launchers,  jeep-mounted  106mm  antitank  recoilless 
rifles,  and  some  20  armored  vehicles.  The  SPLM/A  also  had  a  supply  of 
land  mines  that  were  widely  used. 

Amnesty  International  and  Africa  Watch  reported  that  the  SPLM/A 
killed  captured  SAF  and  militia  prisoners  and  executed  civilians  believed 
to  be  informers  or  opposed  to  the  insurgency.  By  mid- 1989,  the  SPLM/A 
held  about  300  government  troops;  after  the  capture  of  Bor,  there  were 
reports  that  the  SPLM/A  might  have  shot  hundreds  of  surrendering  sol¬ 
diers.  Indiscriminate  SPLM/A  rocket  and  mortar  attacks  on  government- 
held  towns  resulted  in  many  civilian  casualties.

In  August  1991,  the  SPLM/A  fragmented  when  Riek  Machar,  a 
Nuer,  and  Lam  Akol,  a  Shilluk,  demanded  Garang’s  removal  as  com¬ 
mander.  The  two  accused  Garang  of  being  “autocratic”  and  “dictatorial” 
and  of  having  turned  the  Southern  struggle  into  a  “reign  of  terror.” 
Moreover,  Garang  opposed  Southern  self-determination  and  advocated 
a  “New  Sudan”  that  was  democratic,  pluralistic,  and  united.  Machar  and 
Akol  assumed  command  of  the  so-called  SPLM/A-Nasir  faction  and 
established  links  with  the  al-Bashir  regime  to  obtain  weapons  and  other 
military  supplies,  which  Khartoum  supplied  in  the  belief  that  such  aid 
would  weaken  the  SPLM/A.  Garang  responded  to  this  challenge  by 
renaming  what  remained  of  the  SPLM/A  as  SPLM/A-Torit;  he  subse¬ 
quently  changed  the  name  to  SPLM/A-Mainstream.  Shortly  thereafter, 
Garang’s  deputy,  William  Nyoun,  left  and  formed  another  faction  called 
SPLM/A-Unity.  In  November  1992,  these  animosities  resulted  in 
clashes  between  the  Garang  group  and  its  Southern  opponents,  fighting 
that  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  at  least  2,000  fighters. 

In  March  1995,  Garang  announced  that  he  planned,  in  cooperation 
with  Northern  opposition  parties,  to  take  the  war  to  Khartoum  by  organiz¬ 
ing  the  “New  Sudan  Brigade.”  This  initiative  never  materialized,  but  on 
March  27,  former  U.S.  president  Jimmy  Carter  persuaded  the  Sudanese 
government  to  declare  a  two-month  cease-fire.  The  SPLM/A  and  the 
South  Sudan  Independence  Movement  (SSIM)  also  pledged  to  honor  the 


339 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


cease-fire,  soon  extended  for  another  two  months.  However,  on  June  26, 
Garang’s  soldiers  attacked  two  villages  in  the  Ganyiel  region,  killing  210 
villagers,  looting  and  then  destroying  more  than  1,000  households,  and 
seizing  3,500  cattle.  The  following  month,  the  SPLM/A  and  the  SSIM 
clashed  in  western  Upper  Nile  Province.  In  May  1996,  the  two  rebel 
groups  merged  but,  a  month  later,  they  resumed  hostilities  which  lasted 
for  months.  On  April  21,  1997,  the  SSIM,  led  by  Riek  Machar,  signed  a 
separate  peace  with  the  central  government.  The  al-Bashir  regime 
responded  by  providing  cash  and  weapons  to  the  SSIM. 

Several  thousand  SPLM/A  rebels  attacked  areas  northeast  and  south 
of  Wau  on  January  28-29,  1998.  In  May,  the  SPLM/A  launched  an 
offensive  against  government  garrisons  in  southern  Blue  Nile  Province. 
Similar  attacks  and  political  squabbling  between  the  al-Bashir  regime 
and  various  factions  in  the  South  and  in  Khartoum  continued  for  the 
next  several  years. 

The  Southern  war  ended  on  January  9,  2005,  when  Garang  and  the 
Sudanese  government  signed  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  that, 
among  other  things,  made  Garang  vice  president  of  Sudan.  Garang  had 
hardly  settled  into  office,  however,  before  he  died  in  a  helicopter  crash 
on  August  1,  2005,  while  returning  to  Juba  from  a  visit  to  Uganda.  Salva 
Kiir  Mayardit,  a  deputy  with  the  reputation  of  being  a  soldier’s  soldier, 
then  assumed  leadership  of  the  SPLM/A.  Unlike  Garang,  who  was  pop¬ 
ular  and  influential  in  Washington,  Kiir  has  made  few  visits  to  the  U.S. 
He  has,  instead,  concentrated  on  extending  his  influence  in  South  Sudan 
and  on  implementing  the  provisions  of  the  peace  agreement. 

South  Sudan  lacked  a  realistic  political-military  strategy  in  early 
2011.  Among  its  many  shortcomings  were  corruption,  budget  short¬ 
falls,  and  inadequate  planning  by  the  military  as  well  as  by  the  South¬ 
ern  government.  Moreover,  GOSS  has  failed  to  transform  the  SPLA 
into  a  conventional  anny.  Despite  these  problems,  President  Kiir  autho¬ 
rized  the  purchase  of  a  large  number  of  tanks,  which  require  constant 
maintenance,  activity  likely  to  test  the  capabilities  of  the  SPLA. 

Paramilitary  Groups  and  Forced  Migration 

Militias 

During  the  Southern  civil  war,  many  government-supported  militia 
groups  served  as  adjuncts  to  the  SAF  forces;  indeed,  the  al-Numayri 
government  created  the  first  militias  in  1983.  During  the  next  25  years, 
Khartoum  armed  and  financed  numerous  paramilitary  forces,  the  most 
important  of  which  was  the  Popular  Defense  Forces  (PDF),  estab¬ 
lished  in  November  1989  to  fight  the  SPLM/A. 


340 


National  Security 


This  umbrella  group  of  militias,  which  was  under  SAF  control,  was 
modeled  on  Iran’s  Islamic  Revolutionary  Guard  Corps.  The  PDF  was 
frequently  referred  to  as  the  paramilitary  wing  of  the  NIF.  According 
to  the  Popular  Defense  Forces  Act  (1989),  an  organization  called  the 
Council  of  the  Popular  Defense  Forces  advised  the  commander  in 
chief  on  all  matters  affecting  the  PDF.  PDF  training  was  compulsory 
for  all  male  and  female  government  employees  over  the  age  of  33,  but 
there  were  reports  that  the  PDF  recruited  children  under  the  age  of  18. 
PDF  training  also  has  been  compulsory  since  1992  for  all  male  and 
female  students  in  institutes  of  higher  education.  Female  prisoners 
could,  in  theory,  secure  their  release  by  attending  PDF  training  for  45 
days.  The  PDF  provided  arms,  training,  and  uniforms  to  recruits  after 
they  came  under  army  command.  The  size  of  the  PDF  was  difficult  to 
determine,  but  as  of  2010,  military  analysts  estimated  PDF  strength  at 
some  17,500  active-duty  personnel  and  about  85,000  reservists.  The 
governor  of  Khartoum  State  in  a  public  address  in  early  20 1 1  cited  a 
state  figure  of  37,000,  presumably  both  active  and  reserve  personnel,  a 
lower  number  than  many  independent  estimates. 

The  PDF  supposedly  relieved  the  SAF  of  local  defense  duties,  thus 
allowing  the  armed  forces  to  concentrate  on  holding  major  garrisons  and 
undertaking  offensive  operations  against  the  SPLM/A.  The  PDF  was 
active  in  Darfur  from  the  outbreak  of  hostilities  in  2003  (see  Internal 
Security  Agencies,  this  ch.).  In  August  2004,  there  were  reports  that  some 
janjaweed  militiamen  were  being  incorporated  into  the  PDF  and  the 
police  force.  According  to  various  human-rights  organizations,  the  PDF 
has  been  responsible  for  indiscriminate  killings  of  civilians,  abduction, 
occasional  enslavement  of  women  and  children,  and  looting  of  cattle  and 
other  property,  offenses  also  associated  with  the  janjaweed. 

The  Anya  Nya  II  group  originally  formed  in  the  late  1970s  among 
army  mutineers  from  the  South.  Some  later  split  off  from  the  rebel  move¬ 
ment,  obtained  weapons  and  training  from  the  SAF,  and  became  a  major 
factor  in  the  war  from  1984  to  1987.  Predominantly  from  the  Nuer,  the 
second  largest  ethnic  group  in  the  South,  Anya  Nya  II  fought  on  behalf  of 
the  government  in  rural  areas  of  what  was  then  A’ali  an-Nil  Province. 
Anya  Nya  II  emerged  as  a  significant  factor  in  that  province,  disrupting 
SPLM/A  operations  and  interfering  with  the  movement  of  its  recruits  to 
the  Ethiopian  border  area  for  training.  The  government  established  an 
Anya  Nya  II  headquarters  in  Khartoum  to  promote  the  group  as  an  alter¬ 
native  to  the  SPLM/A.  Beginning  in  late  1987,  SPLM/A  military  suc¬ 
cesses  caused  morale  problems  in  Anya  Nya  II  and  induced  major  units 
to  defect  to  the  SPLM/A.  By  mid- 1989,  only  one  Anya  Nya  II  faction 
remained  loyal  to  the  government  and  retained  its  political  base  in  Khar¬ 
toum  after  the  al-Bashir  coup.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Some  of  the  most  devastating  raids  and  acts  of  banditry  against  the 
civilian  population  were  perpetrated  by  militias  known  as  murahalin 
fonned  among  the  Rizayqat,  Rufaa  al-Haj,  Misiriyyah,  and  other 
groups,  all  members  of  the  cattle-raising  Baqqara  Arab  nomad  tribes  in 
Darfhr  and  Kordofan.  These  Arab  communities  traditionally  competed 
for  pastureland  with  the  Dinka  of  northern  Bahr  al-Ghazal  and  southern 
Kordofan.  Raiding  by  the  murahalin  during  the  period  from  1985  to 
1988  displaced  many  Dinka  civilians  in  Bahr  al-Ghazal.  The  murahalin 
received  ammunition,  arms,  and  some  covert  training  from  the  SAF 
and  carried  out  some  joint  counterinsurgency  operations  in  conjunction 
with  government  forces.  According  to  Amnesty  International,  raids 
carried  out  by  the  murahalin  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  tens  of  thousands 
of  civilians;  the  abduction  of  women  and  children,  who  were  forced 
into  slavery;  the  looting  of  livestock;  and  the  burning  of  houses  and 
grain  supplies.  By  late  1988,  the  growing  SPLM/A  presence  had 
reduced  the  murahalin  threat  against  villages  and  cattle  camps.  Even 
so,  pro-Khartoum  militias  continued  to  attack  Dinka  refugees  moving 
north  to  escape  famine  and  raids. 

The  Rizayqat  murahalin  committed  some  of  the  worst  atrocities  of 
the  war  when  they  retaliated  for  losses  suffered  in  an  engagement  with 
the  SPLM/A  by  killing  more  than  1,000  unarmed  Dinka  at  the  Ai¬ 
nu’ ayn  rail  junction,  most  of  them  burned  to  death.  Misiriyyah  murah¬ 
alin  tactics  included  ambushes  of  refugees  and  attacks  on  villagers  in 
northeastern  Bahr  al-Ghazal.  In  1986  the  government  armed  the  Rufaa 
al-Haj  militia,  after  the  SPLM/A  appeared  in  southern  Al-Awsat  Prov¬ 
ince  (present-day  Blue  Nile  State)  to  recruit  followers  among  non-Arab 
peoples.  In  early  1987,  combined  operations  by  the  SAL  and  Rufaa  al- 
Haj  militia  against  non- Arab  populations  in  retaliation  for  an  SPLM/A 
offensive  resulted  in  many  atrocities. 

The  government  also  armed  as  militias  a  number  of  Southern  non- 
Arab  tribes  opposed  to  the  SPLM/A.  In  1985  Khartoum  recruited  mem¬ 
bers  of  the  Mandari  in  Equatoria  to  help  counter  the  growing  SPLM/A 
threat  in  that  area.  Most  of  the  Mandari  dissociated  themselves  from  the 
militia,  however,  as  the  presence  of  the  SPLM/A  strengthened  in  that 
province.  In  Bahr  al-Ghazal,  hostile  relations  between  the  Pertit  militia, 
which  was  concentrated  around  Wau,  and  the  Dinka  spawned  consider¬ 
able  violence,  culminating  in  August-September  1987  in  massacres  of 
Dinka  who  had  taken  refuge  in  Wau. 

Prime  Minister  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  proposed  in  February  1989  that  the 
murahalin  militia  be  institutionalized  as  popular  defense  committees. 
However,  other  political  groups  in  Khartoum  opposed  this  recommen¬ 
dation  because  they  feared  that  the  murahalin  would  become  allied 
with  Sadiq’s  Umma  Party.  In  October  1989,  the  al-Bashir  government 


342 


National  Security 


promulgated  the  Popular  Defense  Forces  Act,  seemingly  to  give  legiti¬ 
macy  to  the  militias  as  SAF  auxiliaries.  The  act  led  to  the  establishment 
of  a  new  paramilitary  body,  the  Popular  Defense  Forces.  It  did  not, 
however,  result  in  the  disappearance  of  the  existing  militias,  which 
throughout  the  1 990s  and  early  2000s  continued  to  act  in  concert  with 
the  SAF,  against  the  SPLM/A  and  civilians  in  the  South  and  in  Darfur. 

None  of  the  militias  active  in  the  early  2000s  were  more  notorious 
than  the  janjaweed.  Reportedly  organized  and  armed  by  the  central  gov¬ 
ernment,  they  were  heavily  involved  in  the  fighting  in  Darfur  from  2003 
and  were  widely  accused  of  committing  atrocities  against  the  civilian 
population.  Janjaweed  militia  members  were  normally  armed  with  rifles, 
relied  on  camels  or  horses  to  move  about  the  Darfur  region,  and  in  the 
early  stages  of  the  war  were  usually  drawn  from  the  Irayqat  (also  seen  as 
Ereigat),  Um  Jalul,  and  Mahariyya,  all  divisions  of  the  Abbala  Rizayqat 
Arabs  of  North  Darfur.  The  janjaweed  constituted  an  arm  of  the  SAF  and 
fought  against  rebel  groups  such  as  the  Sudan  Liberation  Army  and  the 
Justice  and  Equality  Movement.  As  the  Darfur  conflict  evolved,  how¬ 
ever,  the  membership  of  the  janjaweed  broadened.  As  of  201 1,  the  term 
had  come  to  apply  to  any  of  the  ethnically  based  armed  groups  as  well  as 
to  the  brigands  that  continued  to  raid  and  plunder  in  Darfur,  not  just  to  the 
Abbala  or  other  government-supported  groups. 

Forced  Migration 

Sudan  has  historically  been  a  generator  of  forced  migration  and  inter¬ 
nally  displaced  populations.  For  instance,  during  the  first  Southern  civil 
war  (1955-72),  perhaps  1  million  Southerners  were  forced  to  migrate. 
Aside  from  war,  internal  migration  was  further  exacerbated  with  the  dis¬ 
covery  of  oil  in  the  late  1970s,  as,  for  example,  in  the  early  1980s  when 
President  al-Numayri  sought  to  redraw  Southern  borders  to  bring  the  oil¬ 
fields  into  a  newly  created  Unity  State  under  his  control.  In  1985-86  Prime 
Minister  Sadiq  al-Mahdi  relied  on  tribal  militias  to  move  Southerners  away 
from  oil-rich  areas. 

President  al-Bashir  pursued  a  scorched-earth  policy  against  Southern 
populations  in  the  1990s,  using  SAF  troops,  proxy  militias,  and  Nuer 
warlords  who  had  turned  against  the  SPLM/A,  to  ensure  their  departure 
from  oil-rich  areas.  The  militias  attacked,  burned,  looted,  and  abducted 
women  and  children.  The  central  government  then  moved  loyal  popula¬ 
tions  onto  the  land.  Such  tactics  were  applied,  for  example,  in  Upper 
Nile  Province  against  both  Nuer  and  Dinka  populations  as  well  as 
against  an  estimated  100,000  Shilluk  around  Malakal. 

Beginning  in  1992  in  the  plains  and  mountains  of  southern  Kordofan, 
the  government  began  to  seize  Nuba  farmland  as  part  of  a  strategy  to  expel 
populations  whose  loyalty  was  suspect.  In  this  area,  fertile  land  in  the 


343

plains  was  converted  to  mechanized  agriculture.  Many  Nuba  were  gradu¬ 
ally  forced  to  retreat  into  higher,  less-productive  elevations,  whereas  others 
became  refugees  in  Khartoum  and  elsewhere.  Of  an  original  population 
estimated  at  1 .5  million,  only  about  400,000  remained  in  their  homeland 
by  the  early  2000s. 

The  January  2005  peace  agreement  notwithstanding,  hopes  of  a  “peace 
dividend”  and  of  the  eventual  return  of  refugees  and  displaced  people  to 
South  Sudan  remained  largely  unfulfilled  several  years  later.  Moreover, 
GOSS  lacked  the  capabilities  to  build  infrastructure,  establish  an  effective 
administration,  and  devise  a  viable  strategy  to  absorb  returnees,  all  of 
which  worked  to  deter  returnees.  By  October  2005,  only  a  small  number 
of  refugees  in  neighboring  countries  had  returned  voluntarily  to  South 
Sudan,  along  with  some  250,000  of  the  internally  displaced.  The  central 
government  sought  to  obstruct  the  flow  of  returnees  by  using  force  to 
demolish  homes  and  by  harassing  agencies  that  sought  to  help  and  protect 
them.  The  increasing  availability  of  small  anus,  population  growth,  and 
the  central  government’s  detenuination  to  cleanse  areas  located  in  and 
around  Southern  oil  fields  ensured  that  recurring  disputes  about  access  to 
fertile  land  and  water  or  over  stolen  cattle  would  probably  continue  for  the 
foreseeable  future. 

Foreign  Military  Assistance 

Sudan  historically  has  relied  on  an  array  of  Western  and  non- West¬ 
ern  suppliers  for  military  equipment  and  training.  The  proliferation  of 
small  anus  in  Sudan  originated  during  the  occupation  of  the  country  by 
Ottoman  and  Egyptian  forces  and  by  the  colonial  powers,  especially 
Britain  and  France,  in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries. 
Small  anus  continued  to  flow  into  Sudan  after  independence,  supple¬ 
mented,  however,  by  much  larger  military  hardware. 

Sudan  had  only  a  limited  arms  industry  until  the  late  1990s,  except  for 
a  production  line  for  small-caliber  ammunition.  Consequently,  foreign 
sources  for  weapons,  equipment,  ammunition,  and  technical  training  have 
been  indispensable.  After  independence,  British  advisers  helped  train  the 
Sudan  Army  and  Sudan  Air  Force,  and  British  equipment  predominated 
in  the  ground  forces.  Diplomatic  and  military  relations  with  Britain  and 
other  Western  nations  were  broken  after  the  June  1967  Arab-Israeli  War, 
and  the  breach  was  filled  by  close  military  cooperation  with  the  Soviet 
Union.  Soviet  assistance  coincided  with  a  dramatic  expansion  in  Sudan 
Armed  Forces  personnel  from  18,000  in  1966  to  nearly  50,000  by  1972. 
The  bulk  of  the  equipment  used  by  the  ground  and  air  forces  throughout 
the  1970s  until  the  early  1980s  was  of  Soviet  manufacture,  including 
tanks,  artillery,  and  MiG  combat  aircraft.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Relations  with  the  Soviets  cooled  in  the  late  1970s,  and  Sudan  turned 
to  China  and  Britain  for  training  and  equipment  as  well  as  to  Yugoslavia, 
which  was  instrumental  in  the  founding,  training,  and  supply  of  vessels 
for  the  Sudan  Navy.  In  addition,  Sudan  received  financing  from  Arab 
states,  particularly  Saudi  Arabia,  for  the  purchase  of  Western  military 
equipment.  Until  1985,  however,  Sudan’s  closest  military  ties  were  with 
Egypt,  defined  by  a  25-year  defense  agreement  signed  in  1976.  The 
accord  provided  for  shared  planning  and  staffing;  the  Egyptians  also  sup¬ 
plied  Sudan  with  ammunition  and  various  types  of  weaponry,  such  as 
antitank  missiles  and  armored  personnel  carriers.  Al-Bashir  reaffirmed 
the  pact  after  his  1989  coup,  but  the  Egyptians  declined  to  supply  addi¬ 
tional  military  aid  after  Sudan  refused  to  condemn  the  Iraqi  invasion  of 
Kuwait  in  1990  and  in  view  of  al-Bashir’s  repressive  policies  at  home. 

U.S.  military  aid  to  Sudan  initially  consisted  primarily  of  training  a 
small  number  of  Sudanese  officers.  Soon  after  agreeing  in  November 
1976  to  provide  Sudan  with  selected  arms,  the  United  States  sold  Sudan 
transport  aircraft,  a  purchase  financed  by  Saudi  Arabia,  followed  several 
years  later  by  F-5  combat  aircraft.  Between  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glos¬ 
sary)  1979  and  FY  1982,  military  sales  credits  rose  from  US$5  million  to 
US$100  million.  Apart  from  aircraft,  the  United  States  provided  Sudan 
with  artillery,  annored  personnel  carriers,  Commando  armored  cars,  and 
M-60  tanks.  U.S.  grant  aid  reached  a  peak  of  US$  1 0 1  million  in  FY  1 982. 
Sudan  granted  the  United  States  naval  port  facilities  at  Port  Sudan  and 
gave  the  United  States  Central  Command  (CENTCOM)  some  airport¬ 
prepositioning  rights  for  military  equipment  for  contingent  use.  In  1981 
and  1883,  Sudanese  and  American  forces  participated  in  Bright  Star  joint 
maneuvers. 

The  United  States  reduced  military  grants  and  credits  when  the  South¬ 
ern  Sudanese  civil  war  resumed  in  1983.  After  FY  1987,  no  assistance  was 
extended  with  the  exception  of  less  than  US$1  million  annually  for 
advanced  training  for  SAF  officers  and  maintenance  for  previously  sup¬ 
plied  equipment.  Washington  suspended  military  aid  in  1989  under  a  pro¬ 
vision  of  the  United  States  Foreign  Assistance  Act  that  prohibits  assistance 
to  countries  in  arrears  on  interest  payments  on  previous  loans.  In  March 
1990,  the  United  States  invoked  a  provision  of  the  act  barring  aid  to 
regimes  that  overthrow  a  democratic  government.  The  United  States  ter¬ 
minated  arms  sales  to  Sudan  in  late  1992,  while  the  European  Union  insti¬ 
tuted  an  arms  embargo  against  Sudan  in  1994.  These  actions,  however, 
had  no  impact  on  Sudan’s  ability  to  replenish  its  arsenals. 

According  to  the  U.S.  Arms  Control  and  Disarmament  Agency, 
Sudan  obtained  about  US$350  million  in  military  arms  and  equipment 
between  1983  and  1988.  The  United  States  was  the  largest  supplier, 
accounting  for  US$120  million.  China  and  France  each  provided  US$30

million  and  Britain,  US$10  million.  About  US$160  million  came  from 
unidentified  sources,  probably  largely  from  Egypt  and  Libya,  and  as  pur¬ 
chases  from  other  Western  suppliers  financed  by  Arab  countries. 

Various  Middle  East  and  Gulf  countries,  particularly  Iran  and  Libya 
but  also  Egypt,  provided  more  than  US$2  billion  in  “economic  aid”  in 
the  1970s,  much  of  which  Khartoum  used  to  buy  weapons.  Additionally, 
each  of  Sudan’s  neighbors  provided  weapons  and/or  sanctuary  to  vari¬ 
ous  anti-Khartoum  rebel  groups  and  militias.  Since  the  early  1990s,  at 
least  34  countries  have  exported  ammunition,  light  anus,  and  small  anus 
to  Sudan.  In  more  recent  years,  reliable  sources  have  suggested  that  there 
were  between  1.9  and  3.2  million  small  arms  in  Sudan.  About  one-fifth 
of  these  weapons  were  held  by  the  Sudanese  government  and/or  pro- 
Khartoum  militias. 

Sudan  constituted  one  of  Africa’s  major  consumers  of  weapons  in  the 
early  2000s.  As  was  the  case  in  earlier  decades,  Sudan  continued  to  rely 
on  an  array  of  suppliers,  among  them  Belams,  China,  Egypt,  Iran,  Roma¬ 
nia,  Russia,  Poland,  and  South  Africa,  for  ammunition,  anuored  vehicles, 
helicopters,  howitzers,  infantry  fighting  vehicles,  attack  and  fighter  air¬ 
craft,  multiple  rocket  launchers,  main  battle  tanks,  and  transport  aircraft. 
Additionally,  China  supervised  arms  assembly  and  assisted  in  the  con¬ 
struction  of  weapons  factories. 

Sudan  manufactured  at  least  a  small  amount  of  ammunition  for  light 
weapons  in  the  early  1960s,  but  the  country’s  capacity  to  produce  arms 
greatly  expanded  with  the  opening  of  the  GIAD  industrial  city  south  of 
Khartoum  in  October  2000  (see  Manufacturing,  ch.  3).  Under  the  aus¬ 
pices  of  the  Military  Industry  Coiporation  within  the  Ministry  of  Defense, 
engineering  and  industrial  enterprises  produced  or  imported  a  range  of 
equipment  and  technology  for  ground  and  air  forces.  Although  informa¬ 
tion  was  limited,  in  the  early  2000s  this  equipment  included  heavy  and 
light  artillery,  antitank  and  antiaircraft  guns,  machine  guns  and  small 
arms,  tanks,  and  armored  personnel  carriers,  as  well  as  ammunition  for 
these  weapons;  the  country  also  had  acquired  the  ability  to  assemble  and 
maintain  aircraft,  including  fighter  and  cargo  airplanes  and  helicopters. 

The  SPLM/A,  under  the  late  John  Garang’s  leadership,  regularly 
accused  the  SAF  of  using  chemical  weapons  in  South  Sudan,  but  these 
allegations  were  never  substantiated.  The  same  was  true  of  the  U.S. 
charge  in  1998  that  the  Al-Shifa  Pharmaceuticals  Industries  factory  in 
Khartoum  North  was  developing  chemical  weapons  or  precursor  chem¬ 
icals,  a  claim  that  led  to  the  United  States  bombing  of  the  plant.  Simi¬ 
larly,  news  reports  in  2004  that  Sudanese  and  Syrian  troops  had  tested 
chemical  weapons  against  civilians  in  Darfur  were  never  confirmed. 
Some  independent  observers  maintain  that  Garang  on  his  part  used  the 
chemical-weapons  issue  as  a  disinformation  campaign  against  Khar¬ 
toum  and  Washington.

Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


Internal  Security  Agencies 

Domestic  order  in  Sudan,  except  in  the  South,  was  a  shared  respon¬ 
sibility  of  the  SAF,  the  national  police  force,  and  security  organs  of  the 
Ministry  of  Interior.  The  authorities  relied  on  the  police,  SAF,  and 
martial  law  to  maintain  peace  in  unstable  regions. 

The  Sudan  Police  Force 

The  British  army  assigned  a  captain  to  the  central  administration  for 
police  duties  in  1898.  He  commanded  30  British  army  officers  and  helped 
to  organize  provincial  police  forces.  In  1901  the  authorities  decentralized 
the  police  to  improve  efficiency.  The  government  assumed  responsibility 
for  administrative  control  of  the  police  in  1908,  but  provincial  governors 
retained  operational  control  of  the  forces.  In  1928  the  British  established 
the  Sudan  Police  Force  (SPF)  under  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  Throughout 
the  colonial  period,  the  police  lacked  the  resources  and  manpower  to 
deploy  officers  throughout  Sudan.  Instead,  the  government  gave  tribal 
leaders  authority  to  maintain  order  among  their  people  and  to  enlist  a  lim¬ 
ited  number  of  “retainers”  to  help  them  in  law-enforcement  duties.  This 
communal  security  system  remained  in  effect  until  the  early  1970s. 

The  Sudan  Police  College  opened  in  Khartoum  in  1937  to  train  all 
policemen  and  administrators  in  a  one-  or  two-year  course.  Graduates 
could  transfer  between  the  two  services  initially,  but  by  1948  training 
had  become  too  specialized  to  allow  this  practice.  In  1969  the  authorities 
built  a  police  laboratory  to  enhance  criminal-investigation  capabilities. 

The  SPF  faced  several  challenges  during  the  colonial  and  early  post¬ 
colonial  periods.  On  June  4,  1951,  a  group  of  police  officers  met  to  dis¬ 
cuss  recent  labor  unrest  in  Khartoum,  North  Khartoum,  and  Omdunnan. 
The  British  commandant  broke  up  the  meeting.  The  police  officers  then 
staged  a  demonstration  that  resulted  in  the  dismissal  of  the  ringleaders, 
who  refused  an  order  to  return  to  barracks.  On  June  8-9,  companies  from 
the  Camel  Corps  and  the  Eastern  Arab  Corps  arrived  in  Khartoum  from 
Al-Obeid  and  Kassala  to  prevent  further  unrest  while  the  SDF  disarmed 
the  police.  A  few  days  later,  the  authorities  allowed  670  police  officers  to 
return  to  duty  but  sacked  222  others.  The  British  released  a  report  in  July 
that  blamed  the  unrest  on  incompetent  British  officers  who  commanded 
the  police  and  on  wretched  housing  conditions.  In  the  aftermath  of  this 
report,  workmen  built  new  housing  and  renovated  old  barracks. 

The  SPF  and  army  worked  together  from  1965  to  1969  to  quell  the 
unrest  caused  by  the  rebellion  in  the  Southern  provinces.  By  1970,  SPF 
headquarters  included  administration,  immigration,  nationality,  public 
affairs,  training,  and  security  administration.  These  divisions  also  existed 
at  provincial  levels.  Each  provincial  police  force  had  about  2,000  officers.

National  Security 


Khartoum  frequently  modified  the  command  and  administration  of  the 
SPF. 

Prior  to  1977,  women  served  in  the  police  after  learning  basic 
administrative  duties  and  working  on  criminal  cases  involving  women 
as  witnesses  or  defendants.  In  1977  four  women  completed  the  two- 
year  course  at  the  Sudan  Police  College  and  became  the  first  females 
to  join  the  ranks.  A  limited  number  of  women  served  in  the  SPF  and 
generally  worked  in  administrative  sections,  on  juvenile  delinquency 
matters,  or  criminal  cases  that  involved  female  Sudanese  witnesses  or 
defendants 

The  police  reported  to  the  minister  of  interior  until  1979,  when  that 
post  was  abolished,  and  various  ministers  became  responsible  for  dif¬ 
ferent  areas  of  police  work.  This  arrangement  proved  unwieldy,  how¬ 
ever,  and  the  Police  Act  of  1979  instituted  a  unified  command  in  which 
the  head  of  the  force  reported  to  the  president.  After  al-Numayri's  fall, 
the  cabinet  position  of  minister  of  interior  was  restored,  and  the  director 
general  of  police  was  made  responsible  to  the  minister. 

Central  police  headquarters  in  Khartoum  was  organized  into  several 
divisions — such  as  administration,  training,  and  security  affairs — each 
commanded  by  a  police  major  general.  The  main  operational  elements 
included  the  traffic  police  and  the  riot  police.  The  1979  legislation 
brought  specialized  police  units,  such  as  one  for  the  Sudan  Railways, 
under  the  SPF’s  authority.  Khartoum  headquarters  maintained  liaison  and 
cooperated  with  the  International  Criminal  Police  Organization  (Interpol) 
and  agencies  involved  in  combating  international  dmg  trafficking. 

The  government's  new  administrative  system  delegated  many  powers 
to  the  regional  level,  but  law  enforcement  outside  major  urban  areas  was 
organized  at  the  state  level.  Thus,  the  SPF  was  subdivided  into  state  com¬ 
mands,  which  were  organized  according  to  the  same  divisions  found  in 
the  national  headquarters.  Local  police  directors  reported  to  state  police 
commissioners,  who  in  turn  were  responsible  to  the  SPF  director  general 
in  Khartoum.  Each  provincial  command  had  its  own  budget. 

The  SPF  expanded  from  roughly  7,500  officers  and  men  in  1956  to 
about  18,000  in  1970  and  30,000  by  2005.  As  of  2010,  internal  security 
was  divided  up  among  an  array  of  organizations,  including  the  United 
Police  Forces  (UPF),  Popular  Police  Forces  (PPF),  Popular  Defense 
Forces,  and  Border  Intelligence  Guard. 

The  United  Police  Forces  had  an  estimated  30,000  personnel  who 
were  responsible  for  civil  defense,  criminal  investigations,  immigration 
and  customs,  passport  control,  traffic  control,  and  wildlife  protection. 
Police  divisions  normally  operated  within  state  commands.  State  police 
commissioners  reported  to  the  director  general  of  police  in  Khartoum, 
who  answered  to  the  minister  of  interior.  The  UPF  inventory  included 
40  Fahd  armored  fighting  vehicles,  20  Panhard  M3  armored  fighting 


349 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


vehicles,  and  30  armored  personnel  carriers.  The  serviceability  of  these 
vehicles  was  unknown.  Generally,  the  UPF  had  not  deployed  significant 
numbers  of  officers  to  South  Sudan.  After  2004,  an  unknown  number  of 
UPF  personnel  deployed  to  Darfur.  Human-rights  advocates  accused  the 
UPF  of  committing  an  array  of  human-rights  atrocities. 

The  Popular  Police  Forces,  created  in  1989,  were  estimated  to  have 
at  least  35,000  members  who  technically  were  under  the  supervision  of 
the  director  general  of  police.  In  fact,  the  PPF  was  little  more  than  an 
Islamist  vigilante  group  that  supposedly  assisted  the  UPF.  It  operated  as 
a  politicized  militia  that  sought  to  enforce  “moral  standards”  among  the 
country’s  Islamic  population.  The  PPF,  not  surprisingly,  had  a  poor 
human-rights  record. 

Sudan  lacked  a  true  border  guard.  The  UPF  was  responsible  for  pass¬ 
port  control,  immigration,  and  customs  at  border-crossing  points,  although 
the  SAF  and  the  PDF  might  also  undertake  border-control  duties.  How¬ 
ever,  there  was  a  Border  Intelligence  Guard  that  operated  outside  the  SAF 
chain  of  command;  it  reported  directly  to  SAF  military  intelligence  offi¬ 
cers  in  the  area  of  operations.  The  Border  Intelligence  Guard  was  active 
during  the  Southern  civil  war.  In  2002-3,  the  guard  recmited  sources  in 
Darfur  to  gather  information  about  political  and  military  conditions.  Some 
observers  accused  the  guard  of  recruiting  for  the  janjaweed. 

No  information  was  available  about  training  in  the  al-Bashir  era,  but 
formerly  police  officer  cadets  usually  received  two  years  of  training  at 
the  Sudan  Police  College  near  Khartoum.  The  institution  provided  the¬ 
oretical  and  practical  instruction  and  served  as  a  training  school  for  mil¬ 
itary  personnel  who  required  police  skills  in  their  assignments.  In 
addition  to  recruit  training,  the  college  offered  courses  in  criminal  law, 
general  police  duties,  fingerprinting,  clerical  work,  photography,  and 
the  use  of  small  anns.  Enlisted  recruits  usually  underwent  four  months 
of  training  at  state  headquarters. 

State  police  traditionally  enjoyed  good  relations  with  the  local  com¬ 
munities,  but  in  Khartoum  if  not  elsewhere,  police  treatment  of  arrested 
persons  could  be  harsh.  During  the  1990s  and  early  2000s,  public-order 
campaigns  in  Khartoum  often  resulted  in  roundups  of  thousands  of  peo¬ 
ple,  who  were  then  charged  with  illegal  street  vending  or  loitering.  In 
urban  areas,  police  abused  refugees,  particularly  Southerners,  by  stealing 
from  them  or  beating  them  for  minor  infractions.  The  police  also  admin¬ 
istered  floggings  for  drinking  alcohol  or  for  curfew  violations.  Refugees 
seldom  had  recourse  to  the  legal  system  when  attacked  by  the  police. 
Partly  as  a  result  of  such  actions,  the  al-Bashir  government  earned  a  rep¬ 
utation  for  poor  treatment  of  prisoners.

National  Security 


Security  and  Intelligence  Apparatus 

The  Sudanese  internal  security  and  intelligence  apparatus  evolved  into 
a  feared  and  hated  institution  after  al-Numayri  came  to  power  in  1969. 
When  the  Revolutionary  Command  Council  (RCC)  held  sway,  from 
1969  to  1971,  military  intelligence  began  to  investigate  domestic  opposi¬ 
tion  groups.  After  the  RCC  was  abolished,  the  organization  focused  on 
evaluating  and  countering  military  threats  to  the  regime.  It  also  provided 
a  400-man  Presidential  Guard. 

The  government  established  the  Office  of  State  Security  in  the  Minis¬ 
try  of  Interior  in  1971.  The  new  agency  evaluated  infonnation  gathered 
by  the  police  and  military  intelligence  and  administered  prisons  and  pass¬ 
port  control.  The  president  also  had  the  authority  to  order  the  police  and 
military  intelligence  to  undertake  secret  missions.  In  1978  the  govern¬ 
ment  formed  the  Sudan  Security  Organization  (SSO).  Under  the  minister 
of  state’s  direction,  the  SSO  became  a  prominent  feature  of  al-Numayri ’s 
regime,  employing  about  45,000  persons  and  rivaling  the  armed  forces  in 
size.  The  government  disbanded  it  in  1985. 

Surveillance  of  antigovemment  organizations  and  individuals  inten¬ 
sified  after  the  1989  coup.  Sudanese  intelligence  personnel  frequently 
prevented  contact  between  Sudanese  and  foreigners,  harassed  suspected 
dissidents,  monitored  church  services,  and  supervised  the  activities  of 
journalists.  Neighborhood  “popular  committees”  used  their  control  over 
the  rationing  system  to  monitor  households. 

The  al-Bashir  government  created  a  new  security  body,  known  as 
Islamic  Security  or  Security  of  the  Revolution.  A  member  of  the  Revolu¬ 
tionary  Command  Council  for  National  Salvation  commanded  the  organi¬ 
zation,  which  was  staffed  by  NIF  supporters.  It  protected  al-Bashir  against 
a  coup  and  monitored  the  activities  of  other  security  forces  and  the  SAF. 
Critics  accused  the  organization  of  indiscriminately  arresting  suspected 
regime  opponents  and  torturing  them  in  so-called  ghost  houses  before 
turning  them  over  to  prison  authorities  for  further  detention.  According  to 
human-rights  advocates,  political  repression  was  this  organization’s  pri¬ 
mary  mission.  The  status  of  Islamic  Security  in  the  early  2000s  was 
unknown,  but  there  were  indications  that  it  might  have  been  disbanded  or 
incorporated  into  other  agencies.  A  similar  organization,  Youth  for  Recon¬ 
struction,  mobilized  younger  Islamist  activists. 

Sudan’s  security  and  intelligence  apparatus  played  a  significant  role  in 
keeping  the  regime  in  power.  Among  other  things,  security  and  intelli¬ 
gence  personnel  participated  in  Sudan’s  civil  wars,  supported  pro-go  vem- 
ment  militias  in  South  Sudan  and  Darfur,  managed  informer  networks, 
and  purged  the  civil  service  of  disloyal  elements.  External  and  military 
intelligence  services  also  sought  to  destabilize  Sudan’s  internal  and  exter¬ 
nal  enemies,  primarily  by  providing  financial  and  military  aid  to  countries

and  rebel  groups  that  were  willing  to  do  Khartoum’s  bidding.  Sudan’s 
two  intelligence  agencies,  for  internal  security  and  external  security, 
merged  in  2002  to  form  the  National  Security  Organization  (NSO). 

Following  the  signing  of  the  peace  agreement  in  January  2005,  the 
NSO  changed  its  name  to  the  National  Intelligence  and  Security  Ser¬ 
vice  (NISS).  The  agreement  stipulated  that  there  would  be  one  NISS 
with  a  mandate  for  giving  advice,  information  gathering,  and  analysis. 
Skeptics  expressed  concern  that  Khartoum  would  continue  to  use  the 
intelligence  apparatus  to  silence  critics  and  would  dominate  the  NISS, 
while  GOSS  would  play  a  lesser  role  in  the  organization.  By  mid-2006, 
only  50  Southern  Sudanese  had  joined  the  NISS.  A  Southerner  also 
became  the  NISS  deputy  director  general.  The  objective  was  to  train 
100  Southerners  every  month  and  then  assign  them  to  NISS  positions. 
However,  it  was  certain  that  whatever  happened,  key  positions  would 
be  filled  by  al-Bashir  loyalists.  In  November  2007,  the  Sudan  Organi¬ 
zation  Against  Torture  reported  that  the  NISS  continued  to  harass 
human-rights  defenders  and  journalists  in  Khartoum  and  to  obstruct  the 
activities  of  the  organizations  for  which  they  worked. 

The  NISS  was  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  National  Security  Act 
of  2010.  The  act  did  not  provide  for  protection  of  basic  human  rights. 
Rather,  it  maintained  earlier  grants  of  extensive  powers  of  arrest  and 
detention  and  gave  NISS  agents  immunity  from  prosecution  and  disci¬ 
plinary  action.  A  2010  Amnesty  International  report  said  of  the  act,  “It 
remains  faithful  to  the  government’s  vision  of  the  national  security 
force  as  a  body  whose  function  is  to  maintain  it  [i.e.,  the  government] 
in  power . . 

No  information  was  available  about  NISS  personnel  strength,  although 
it  was  substantial.  Security  and  intelligence  agents  were  normally 
deployed  throughout  Sudan  and  were  often  present  in  small  towns  and 
villages,  but  the  agency’s  external  capabilities  were  weak.  Several  busi¬ 
nesses  and  organizations  had  links  to  it.  Arbitrary  arrest  and  detention, 
intimidation,  torture,  and  media  censorship  were  commonplace.  As  a 
result,  most  ordinary  Sudanese  remained  fearful  of  the  NISS  and  other 
security  agencies.  Ironically,  several  nations,  including  Egypt,  Britain, 
and  the  United  States,  relied  on  Sudanese  intelligence  for  information 
about  terrorists  in  the  Middle  East.  In  August  2009,  General  Muhammad 
Atta  al-Mula  was  appointed  head  of  the  NISS  in  place  of  Salah  Abdallah 
Gosh,  who  became  a  presidential  adviser.

The  Criminal  Justice  System 

Criminal  Courts  and  Laws 


National  Security 


The  administration  of  justice  traditionally  was  regarded  by  Arabized 
Sudanese  and  a  number  of  Southern  ethnic  groups  as  the  most  impor¬ 
tant  function  of  government.  In  precolonial  times,  supervision  of  justice 
was  solely  in  the  hands  of  the  ruler.  In  the  North,  most  cases  were  actu¬ 
ally  tried  by  an  Islamic  judge,  or  qadi ,  who  was  trained  in  one  of  the 
Sunni  Islamic  legal  schools.  Crimes  against  the  government,  however, 
were  heard  by  the  ruler  and  decided  by  him  with  advice  from  the  grand 
mufti,  an  expert  in  sharia,  who  served  as  a  legal  adviser. 

The  Muslim  influence  on  Sudanese  law  remained  important,  but 
the  long  years  of  British  colonial  rule  meant  that  by  the  mid-twentieth 
century  the  primary  legal  influence  was  British,  because  of  the  weight 
given  to  British  legal  precedents  and  because  most  of  the  lawyers  and 
judges  were  British  trained.  Much  discussion  took  place  at  indepen¬ 
dence  on  the  need  to  reform  or  abrogate  the  system  inherited  from  the 
British.  Under  al-Numayri  in  the  early  1970s,  an  attempt  was  made  to 
introduce  new  civil,  commercial,  and  penal  codes  based  in  part  on 
Egyptian  laws,  but  the  measures  were  repealed  in  1973  in  the  face  of 
resistance  from  the  legal  profession  and  a  public  wedded  to  existing 
laws  and  customs. 

Acting  under  the  strong  influence  of  the  Muslim  Brotherhood  (see 
Glossary)  and  its  secretary-general,  Hassan  Abdallah  al-Turabi,  in  1977 
al-Numayri  appointed  a  committee  charged  with  revising  the  legal  code  to 
bring  it  into  conformity  with  the  sharia.  Only  one  of  the  committee’s  rec¬ 
ommended  bills  was  ever  enacted,  but  following  al-Turabi ’s  appointment 
as  attorney  general  in  November  1981,  the  Islamization  of  the  legal  sys¬ 
tem  proceeded  in  earnest.  This  process  culminated  in  1983  with  the  issu¬ 
ance  of  several  decrees  known  as  the  September  Laws  that  were  based  on 
sharia.  Included  in  the  bills  was  a  new  penal  code  based  on  hudud  (see 
Glossary)  that  prescribed  corporal  punishment  for  crimes  such  as  murder, 
theft,  drinking  alcohol,  prostitution,  and  adultery.  Hudud  punishments 
ranged  from  flogging  and  amputation  to  stoning  and  execution  and  were 
applied  to  Muslims  and  non-Muslims  alike,  a  fact  that  aroused  bitter 
resentment  among  secularized  Muslims  and  non-Muslim  Southerners. 
During  the  final  20  months  of  al-Numayri's  rule,  the  authorities  amputated 
the  anus  or  legs  of  at  least  90  persons  convicted  of  theft. 

The  military  and  civilian  governments  succeeding  al-Numayri 
between  1985  and  1989  retained  the  September  Laws,  but  only  flogging 
sentences  were  actually  carried  out.  Action  on  a  new  Islamic  penal  code 
to  replace  the  September  Laws  was  suspended  by  the  legislature  pend¬ 
ing  a  future  constitutional  convention  that  would  include  the  SPLM/A.

Although  flogging,  normally  40  lashes,  was  limited  to  offenses  involv¬ 
ing  sex  or  alcohol,  it  was  often  inflicted  summarily.  In  1989  the  new 
military  government  extended  flogging  as  a  punishment  for  a  much 
wider  range  of  offenses  but  refrained  from  extreme  hudud  sentences, 
such  as  amputations. 

The  regular  criminal  court  system  featured  extensive  guarantees  of 
due  process  for  accused  persons  in  the  mid-  to  late  1980s.  Trials  were 
held  in  public,  but  the  defendant  could  request  a  closed  trial.  The  accused 
had  to  be  brought  before  a  court  within  48  hours  of  arrest,  informed  of 
the  charges,  and  provided  with  access  to  an  attorney  of  his  or  her  choice. 
There  were  legal  aid  services  for  the  poor,  but  they  were  apportioned  to 
those  facing  serious  charges  and  those  most  in  need.  Bail  was  permitted 
except  in  some  capital  cases.  Defendants  had  the  right  to  speak,  to  pres¬ 
ent  evidence  on  their  own  behalf,  and  to  appeal  judgments. 

After  the  1989  coup,  the  military  regime  initially  retained  the  official 
freeze  on  implementation  of  the  September  Laws,  but  in  January  1991, 
al-Bashir  decreed  that  Islamic  law  would  be  applied  in  courts  through¬ 
out  the  North  but  not  in  the  South.  The  regular  civilian  courts  continued 
to  handle  ordinary  criminal  offenses,  including  theft  and  some  capital 
crimes.  The  court  system  had  a  serious  backlog,  however,  and  the  judi¬ 
ciary  was  less  independent  of  the  executive  than  previously. 

The  regime  established  special  security  courts  in  November  1989. 
Regional  military  governors  and  the  commissioner  of  the  national  capi¬ 
tal  formed  these  courts,  which  had  three-member  panels  of  military  and 
civilian  judges.  They  tried  persons  accused  of  violating  constitutional 
decrees,  emergency  regulations,  and  some  portions  of  the  criminal  code, 
notably  drug  crimes  and  currency  violations.  The  new  security  courts 
did  not  extend  normal  protections  to  the  accused  and  gained  a  reputation 
for  harsh  sentences.  In  areas  of  the  South  affected  by  the  war,  units  of 
the  armed  forces  and  militias  ruled  by  force  of  anus.  In  many  cases,  the 
accused  were  summarily  tried  and  punished,  especially  for  offenses 
against  public  order. 

Sudan’s  court  system  consisted  of  four  types  of  courts  in  the  early 
2000s:  regular,  military,  special,  and  tribal.  Regular  courts  encompassed 
both  civil  and  criminal  courts,  appellate  courts,  and  the  National 
Supreme  Court.  Most  proceedings  of  civil  courts  and  criminal  courts 
were  governed  by  their  respective  legal  codes.  Both  types  of  court  in 
turn  were  governed  by  provisions  of  the  Interim  National  Constitution 
(see  The  Legal  System,  eh.  4).  Punishments  for  criminal  offenses  were 
determined  according  to  sharia,  including  hudud  punishments,  in  the 
Northern  states  but  not  in  the  1 0  states  of  the  South. 

The  interim  constitution  provided  for  fair  and  prompt  trials,  although 
this  provision  was  often  not  honored  in  practice,  according  to  the  U.S.

Department  of  State.  In  civil  and  criminal  courts,  defendants  had  the 
right  to  legal  representation,  and  courts  were  obligated  to  provide  coun¬ 
sel  to  the  indigent  in  cases  punishable  by  life  imprisonment  or  death,  but 
again,  such  rights  reportedly  were  not  universally  respected.  Even  in 
instances  where  defendants  had  legal  counsel,  their  lawyers  in  some 
instances  could  only  offer  advice  and  were  not  permitted  to  address  the 
court  directly.  Testimony  given  under  duress  was  often  admitted  as  evi¬ 
dence.  Defendants  appeared  only  before  judges,  there  being  no  provision 
for  juries.  Trials  were  open  or  closed  to  the  public  at  the  discretion  of  the 
judge(s).  All  decisions  were  subject  to  appeal. 

Military  personnel  were  tried  in  military  courts  and  not  entitled  to  the 
same  rights  as  defendants  in  civil  or  criminal  courts,  such  as  the  right  of 
appeal.  Three-person  special  security  courts  heard  cases  involving  consti¬ 
tutional  issues,  emergency  regulations,  some  sections  of  the  penal  code, 
and  offenses  involving  drugs  and  currency  violations.  Other  special 
courts  handled  most  security-related  cases.  Defendants  were  entitled  to 
legal  representation,  and  attorneys  could  address  the  court  directly.  Sen¬ 
tences  in  special  courts  could  be  harsh  and  were  usually  carried  out 
immediately,  although  defendants  had  the  right  to  appeal.  All  death  sen¬ 
tences  were  automatically  referred  to  the  chief  justice  and  the  head  of 


355

state.  Three  special  criminal  courts  heard  cases  involving  crimes  against 
the  state  in  the  three  states  of  Darfur.  According  to  Amnesty  Interna¬ 
tional,  these  courts  reportedly  suffered  from  the  same  legal  shortcomings 
as  the  regular  criminal  courts  (see  The  Courts,  eh.  4). 

The  judicial  system  in  the  South  was  still  being  constructed  in  early 
2011.  It  consisted  of  a  hierarchy  of  courts  at  the  local,  district,  county, 
and  regional  level,  and  it  suffered  from  a  severe  shortage  of  communica¬ 
tions,  funding,  infrastructure,  and  trained  personnel.  In  addition  to  these 
regular  courts,  GOSS  incorporated  traditional  courts  or  courts  of  elders 
into  its  judicial  system  over  which  local  chiefs  usually  presided.  Tradi¬ 
tional  courts  tried  domestic  matters  and  criminal  cases  according  to  cus¬ 
tomary  law,  but  defendants  had  the  right  of  appeal  to  the  regular  courts. 
The  criminal  code  of  South  Sudan  provided  for  the  death  penalty  for  the 
most  serious  crimes.  Death  sentences  could  be  appealed  to,  and  com¬ 
muted  by,  the  courts  of  appeal.  In  some  areas  of  the  South  as  well  as  in 
the  Nuba  Mountains  where  civil  administration  did  not  exist,  the  judicial 
order  consisted  solely  of  customary  courts.  In  some  instances,  local  mil¬ 
itary  units  reportedly  took  judicial  matters  into  their  own  hands,  espe¬ 
cially  for  offenses  against  the  civil  order. 

The  Prison  System 

Only  limited  information  was  available  on  prisons  in  Sudan  at  the  start 
of  201 1,  and  no  information  was  available  on  the  incidence  of  crime.  Gen¬ 
eral  supervision  of  the  Sudan  Prison  Service  was  carried  out  by  the  director 
general  of  prisons,  who  was  responsible  for  the  country’s  central  prisons 
and  reformatories.  State  authorities  managed  detention  centers  and  jails  in 
their  administrative  jurisdictions.  As  of  the  early  2000s,  Sudan  had  four 
federal  prisons,  Kober  in  Khartoum  North,  Shallah  in  Al-Fashir,  Al-Junay- 
nah  in  West  Darfur,  and  Port  Sudan  on  the  Red  Sea;  26  government  pris¬ 
ons;  and  three  open  prisons.  The  total  prison  staff  was  estimated  at  7,500, 
all  of  whom  were  attached  to  the  police  force.  Correction  officers  under¬ 
went  training  at  the  police  college  and  the  police  academy;  prison  wardens 
received  little  or  no  training.  Additionally,  there  were  four  juvenile  centers, 
and  a  female  prison  in  Omdurman.  Prisons  and  other  detention  facilities 
were  dilapidated  and  in  need  of  expansion  and  replacement,  no  new  major 
prisons  having  been  built  since  the  1950s. 

According  to  government  officials,  the  estimated  prison  population 
was  14,000,  but  the  country’s  prison  capacity  was  only  4,300.  Crowding 
resulted  from  a  judiciary  that  provided  for  no  alternative  to  incarceration 
except  flogging  in  some  cases.  Men  and  women  were  held  in  separate 
quarters,  and  political  prisoners  were  segregated  from  criminal  offenders. 
Prisoners  were  not  registered;  nor  were  they  separated  by  age  or  accord¬ 
ing  to  the  severity  of  offense.  Consequently,  minor  offenders,  including 


356 


National  Security 


juveniles,  were  often  housed  with  hardened  criminals  and  might  be  sub¬ 
ject  to  abuse.  Access  to  legal  aid  was  generally  unavailable  except  for 
those  individuals  able  to  afford  the  legal  fees;  however,  some  nongovern¬ 
mental  organizations,  a  Bar  Association  committee,  and  the  Ministry  of 
Justice  Legal  Aid  Department  provided  some  legal  assistance  to  prison¬ 
ers.  The  death  penalty  remained  in  effect;  however,  both  the  chief  justice 
and  the  president  had  to  approve  all  executions.  Muslim  women  could  be 
executed  for  adultery. 

According  to  UN  and  other  sources,  prison  conditions  were  harsh, 
overcrowded,  and  lacking  in  health  care,  sanitary  facilities,  or  even  food 
for  inmates  apart  from  that  provided  by  relatives.  There  were  reports  that 
abuse,  such  as  beatings  and  deprivation  of  food,  water,  and  other  neces¬ 
sities,  was  routine.  Some  prisoners  allegedly  died  from  lack  of  health 
care  or  from  generally  poor  prison  conditions.  Women  and  vagrant  chil¬ 
dren  were  detained,  often  for  minor  offenses;  they  were  also  subject  to 
abuse  within  the  penal  system.  The  Child  Law  of  2004  represented  an 
attempt  by  the  state  to  adhere  to  international  standards  with  regard  to 
treatment  of  incarcerated  children,  but  the  extent  of  its  implementation 
remained  unclear.  In  any  case,  few  if  any  staff  in  prisons  and  correctional 
institutions  were  qualified  to  deal  with  juvenile  offenders. 

The  Government  of  South  Sudan,  after  signing  the  CPA  in  January 
2005,  was  faced  with  establishing  and  expanding  the  region’s  police  ser¬ 
vice  and  prison  system,  part  of  the  Security  Sector  Reform  program  in 
the  South.  At  the  time,  there  were  about  5,000  police  officers  in  the  South 
Sudan  Police  Force.  Most  of  them  had  little,  if  any,  training,  and  the  force 
lacked  operational  equipment  and  transport.  About  4,000  of  these  offi¬ 
cers  had  been  transferred  from  the  SPLM/A.  Other  recruits  were  demobi¬ 
lized  SPLA  combatants,  few  of  whom  had  police  skills,  and  police  of  the 
Government  of  Sudan  formerly  stationed  in  South  Sudan.  Police  stations 
were  few  in  number,  understaffed,  and  without  qualified  officers. 

In  2006  GOSS  organized  these  groups  into  the  South  Sudan  Police 
Service  (SSPS)  and  placed  the  service  under  the  jurisdiction  of  its  Minis¬ 
try  of  Interior.  Since  then,  demobilized  SPLA  soldiers  continued  to  be 
enrolled  in  the  police  force  and  prison  service  without  formal  training  or 
experience  in  their  duties.  The  SPSS  continually  suffered  from  lack  of 
funding,  a  suitable  legal  framework  for  its  activities,  and  an  effective 
organizational  structure.  Because  of  poor  recordkeeping  and  a  constant 
influx  of  personnel,  the  size  of  the  SSPS  was  difficult  to  determine,  but 
by  2008-9,  GOSS  sources  estimated  it  at  around  20,000  officers,  a  figure 
that  was  expected  to  grow  as  more  SPLA  soldiers  swelled  its  ranks. 
Aside  from  public-security  duty,  the  police  also  had  the  mission  of  pro¬ 
tecting  wildlife  in  the  region’s  six  national  parks,  six  game  reserves,  and 
fisheries  along  the  Nile. 


357 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


To  improve  the  training  of  the  force,  GOSS  relied  on  assistance  from 
international  agencies.  In  December  2006,  the  UN  reported  that  its  police 
technical  advisers  continued  to  train  officers  and  to  improve  SSPS  capa¬ 
bilities.  They  also  provided  support  to  the  Community  Policing  Commit¬ 
tee  that  had  been  established  in  Juba.  In  October  2007,  Uganda  agreed  to 
begin  training  police  officers  as  soon  as  qualified  personnel  could  be 
found.  UNMIS,  among  other  UN  agencies,  was  also  involved  in  capac¬ 
ity-building  of  the  SSPS. 

There  were  few  prisons  in  the  South  Sudan  Prison  Service  in  2005. 
Those  that  existed  lacked  the  most  basic  facilities,  management  staff, 
and  the  capacity  to  ensure  humane  treatment  of  prisoners,  including  pro¬ 
vision  of  health  care  and  food.  These  conditions  improved  somewhat 
during  the  next  four  years,  by  which  time  separate  quarters  were  pro¬ 
vided  for  male  and  female  offenders,  and  juveniles  were  usually  housed 
in  separate  cells.  The  UN  reported  acts  of  abuse  and  torture  in  jails 
maintained  by  the  SPLA  in  some  regions. 

In  May  2007,  the  World  Bank  and  the  United  Nations  Development 
Programme  (UNDP)  signed  a  US$5.3  million  agreement  known  as  the 
South  Sudan  Police  and  Correctional  Service  Support.  Under  this 
accord,  UNDP  agreed  to  build  a  network  of  police  stations  and  training 
centers,  provide  equipment  and  training  to  the  SSPS,  and  improve 
prison  facilities  and  the  treatment  of  male  and  female  inmates.  The  proj¬ 
ect  was  part  of  a  three-year  US$45  million  effort  to  improve  security  in 
South  Sudan  by  restoring  a  quarter  of  the  police  stations  and  seven  cen¬ 
tral  prisons  and  by  providing  training  to  personnel. 

In  June  2007,  the  UN  reported  that  it  had  launched  the  South  Sudan 
Police  Service  Database  to  help  police  keep  data  on  discipline,  pay,  per¬ 
sonnel  information,  promotion,  retirement,  and  training.  In  September,  the 
UNDP  inaugurated  the  Lologo  Regional  Training  Center  as  a  venue  for 
instruction  in  the  South  Sudan  Prison  Service;  a  second  center  was  under 
construction  at  Rumbek.  At  the  same  time,  the  UNDP  initiated  a  training 
program  for  550  SPLM/A  soldiers  who  were  being  transferred  to  the 
prison  service,  the  first  of  approximately  1,500  combatants  to  be  trans¬ 
ferred.  Some  880  SPLM/A  combatants  graduated  as  prison  personnel  in 
November  2007.  In  February  2010,  South  Africa  joined  Germany  and 
GOSS  in  a  partnership  to  train  correctional  services  officers,  judges,  and 
legal  affairs  personnel,  part  of  the  continuing  effort  to  build  a  credible 
security-services  sector  in  South  Sudan. 

Future  Prospects 

Sudan’s  armed  forces  have  played  an  outsized  role  in  both  security 
and  governmental  affairs  since  the  country  gained  independence  in 
1956.  Indeed,  for  almost  the  whole  of  this  period,  the  country  has  been 


358 


National  Security 


subject  to  military  governance,  the  most  recent  episode  of  which  began 
on  June  30,  1989,  when  Colonel  Umar  Hassan  Ahmad  al-Bashir  led  the 
latest  in  a  series  of  coups  against  a  civilian  government.  Although 
many  Sudanese  might  view  the  Sudan  Armed  Forces  (S AF)  as  a  source 
of  stability,  neither  civilian  nor  military  leaders  have  been  able  to 
devise  policies  that  would  address  the  major  issues  of  governance  and 
of  sharing  of  resources  that  lie  at  the  root  of  Sudan’s  troubled  history  as 
an  independent  state. 

During  most  of  that  era,  Sudan’s  armed  forces  confronted  armed 
insurrection  in  the  South,  which  pitted  the  SAF  first  against  the  Anya 
Nya  and  other  groups  for  more  than  a  decade  after  independence,  and 
then  against  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Movement/Army  (SPLM/ 
A)  from  1983  to  2005.  The  cost  of  the  second  civil  war  of  more  than 
two  decades  of  fighting  between  the  SAF  and  the  SPLA  was  enormous 
in  terms  of  both  people  and  resources:  an  estimated  2  million  deaths, 
mostly  civilians,  with  millions  displaced  within  Sudan  or  forced  to  flee 
to  neighboring  countries.  The  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  signed 
on  January  9,  2005,  brought  the  North-South  conflict  to  an  end.  While 
the  accord  succeeded  in  implementing  a  cease-fire,  mutual  troop  with¬ 
drawals,  and  establishing  an  international  monitoring  force,  efforts  at 
military  and  political  cooperation  between  North  and  South  as  well  as  at 
negotiating  governance  and  security  arrangements  in  three  border 
enclaves — Abyei,  southern  Kordofan,  and  Blue  Nile  State — proved  dif¬ 
ficult  or  failed  entirely.  At  the  end  of  a  six-year  period  during  which 
North  and  South  had  attempted  to  work  together  to  build  a  peaceful  and 
united  country,  Southerners  voted  in  2011  to  secede  and  form  an  inde¬ 
pendent  country  with  their  own  government  and  armed  forces. 

In  the  meantime,  in  2003,  rebellion  against  the  government  in  Khar¬ 
toum  had  arisen  in  Darfur  over  the  issues  of  political  marginalization  and 
economic  neglect,  the  same  issues  that  bedeviled  North-South  relations. 
The  war  in  Darfur  pitted  the  SAT  and  allied  militias  against  Darfuri 
forces  in  a  seemingly  intractable  conflict  involving  atrocities  and  human- 
rights  violations  on  a  continual  and  massive  scale.  Repeated  attempts  at 
peacemaking  came  to  naught.  Discontent  also  flared  in  the  East,  but  it 
was  addressed,  at  least  temporarily. 

The  military  situation  in  Sudan  in  early  2011  was  cause  for  serious 
concern.  Although  the  country  faced  no  external  threats,  within  the 
country  the  SAT  confronted  active  or  potential  conflict.  Most  immedi¬ 
ately,  the  looming  breakup  of  the  country  held  the  prospect  for  renewed 
North-South  war.  Aside  from  problems  concerning  oil  production  and 
border  demarcation,  there  was  the  very  real  possibility  of  confrontation 
involving  Abyei,  southern  Kordofan,  and  Blue  Nile  State,  whose  status 
the  CPA  left  for  future  negotiation.  In  the  West,  the  fighting  in  Darfur

had  declined  in  intensity  but  seemed  unlikely  to  be  settled  anytime 
soon.  In  the  East  and  along  the  northern  Nile,  Khartoum  faced  latent 
discontent.  In  addition,  there  were  divisions  among  officers  in  the  army 
that  had  surfaced  in  the  recent  past  as  well  as  disagreements  over  policy 
within  the  al-Bashir  regime.  Given  the  number  and  nature  of  these 
problems,  it  was  unlikely  that  peace  would  come  to  Sudan  anytime 
soon;  consequently,  the  amied  forces  were  certain  to  remain  actively 
engaged  in  Sudan’s  internal  affairs  in  the  near  future.

Details  on  military  units  and  equipment  are  available  from  The  Mili¬ 
tary  Balance ,  published  annually  by  the  International  Institute  for  Strategic 
Studies  in  London,  as  well  as  in  Janes  International  Defence  Review’  and 
Janes  Intelligence  Review.  Reports  by  groups  such  as  Africa  Watch, 
Amnesty  International,  Human  Rights  Watch,  International  Crisis  Group, 
and  the  Small  Arms  Survey  are  essential  for  understanding  current  devel¬ 
opments  in  Sudan.  The  Africa  Contemporary >  Record  volumes  also  con¬ 
tain  information  about  the  SAF  and  the  SPLM/A.  Mansour  Khalid’s  War 
and  Peace  in  Sudan:  A  Tale  of  Two  Countries  contains  a  wealth  of  infor¬ 
mation  about  political  and  military  developments  in  Sudan.  Robert  O.  Col¬ 
lins  has  published  numerous  books  and  articles  about  Sudan’s  history. 
Some  of  his  recent  publications  include  Civil  Wars  and  Revolution  in  the 
Sudan ,  Darfur:  The  Long  Road  to  Disaster,  and  A  History  of  Modem 
Sudan.  The  Root  Causes  of  Sudan  s  Civil  Wars  by  Douglas  H.  Johnson 
and  Darfur:  The  Long  Road  to  Disaster  by  J.  Millard  Burr  and  Robert  O. 
Collins  are  essential  to  understand  recent  developments.  Alex  de  Waal  has 
also  published  prolifically  on  Sudan.  His  more  recent  efforts  include  War 
in  Darfur  and  the  Search  for  Peace,  and  Darfur:  A  Short  History  of  a  Long 
Way  which  is  co-authored  by  Julie  Flint. 

United  States-Sudanese  military  relations  are  recounted  in  Jeffrey  A. 
Lefebvre’s  “Globalism  and  Regionalism:  U.S.  Anns  Transfers  to  Sudan” 
in  Aimed  Forces  and  Society.  Infonnation  on  the  criminal  courts  system 
and  the  record  of  the  al-Bashir  government  with  respect  to  judicial  pro¬ 
cesses  and  human  rights  can  be  found  in  the  annual  County  Reports  on 
Human  Rights  Practices  published  by  the  United  States  Department  of 
State.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,  see  Bibliography.)

Glossary 


Ansar — A  name  given  in  the  nineteenth  century  to  the  followers  of  the 
Sudanese  Mahdi.  Used  today  for  members  of  the  Umma  Party, 
dinar — See  Sudanese  dinar. 

fiscal  year  (FY) — An  annual  period  established  for  accounting  purposes. 

The  Sudanese  fiscal  year  extends  from  July  1  to  the  following  June  30. 
gross  domestic  product  (GDP) — A  measure  of  the  total  value  of  goods 
and  services  produced  by  a  domestic  economy  over  a  fixed  period  of 
time,  such  as  a  year.  GDP  is  obtained  by  adding  the  value  contributed 
by  each  sector  of  the  economy  in  the  form  of  profits,  compensation  to 
employees,  and  depreciation  of  physical  assets  (consumption  of 
capital).  GDP  is  sometimes  aggregated  and  shown  at  market  prices, 
meaning  that  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  are  included;  when  these 
indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  have  been  eliminated,  the  result  is  GDP  at 
factor  cost.  In  developing  countries,  estimates  of  the  value  of  non- 
formal  economic  activity,  such  as  farming,  herding,  and  informal 
trading,  may  be  included. 

gross  national  product  (GNP) — Total  market  value  of  all  final  goods  and 
services  produced  by  an  economy  during  a  fixed  period  of  time,  such 
as  a  year.  Consists  of  gross  domestic  product  plus  income  received  by 
residents  from  investments  and  possessions  abroad,  minus  payments 
remitted  abroad  by  nonresidents.  GNP  is  the  broadest  measure  of  the 
output  of  goods  and  services  by  an  economy, 
hectare — a  unit  of  area  commonly  used  for  land  measurement  in  many 
parts  of  the  world.  1  hectare  =  2.47  acres  or  10,000  square  meters. 
hudud — Punishments  for  severe  crimes  under  Islamic  law.  Punishments 
include  flogging,  amputation  of  limbs,  and  stoning. 

Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Development  (IGAD) — The  subregional 
grouping  of  Djibouti,  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,  Kenya,  Somalia,  Sudan,  and 
Uganda  that  is  focused  on  economic  development  but  that  more  recently 
has  concentrated  on  ending  the  civil  war  in  Sudan  and  the  conflict  in 
Somalia.  Before  1996  it  was  known  as  the  Intergovernmental  Authority 
on  Drought  and  Development  (IGADD). 
janjaweed — Armed  men  or  roving  bandits  who  use  horses,  camels,  or  light 
trucks  to  cany  out  attacks  in  Darfur.  In  2003  and  2004,  the  janjaweed 
were  usually  identified  with  the  Abbala  Arabs  of  North  Darfur  who 


403 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


were  armed  and  sponsored  by  the  central  government  to  attack  rebels. 
Since  then,  the  term  has  come  to  apply  to  any  of  the  lawless  raiders  and 
bandits  who  fight  and  plunder  in  Darfur,  regardless  of  ethnic  or  political 
affiliation. 

Jonglei  Canal — A  diversion  canal  intended  to  carry  water  past  the  White 
Nile  swamps  in  Southern  Sudan.  The  canal  was  to  extend  365 
kilometers  from  the  Sobat  Camp,  where  the  Sobat  River  joins  the 
White  Nile,  to  Bor.  Construction  began  from  the  northern  terminus  in 
1978  and  proceeded  south  for  265  kilometers  until  the  Sudan  People’s 
Liberation  Movement/ Army  attacked  the  giant  digging  machine  in 
1984  and  terminated  the  project. 

Khatmiyyah — A  Muslim  brotherhood  established  in  the  early  nineteenth 
century  by  Muhammad  Uthman  al-Mirghani.  It  became  the  best 
organized  and  most  politically  powerful  brotherhood  in  Eastern  Sudan. 
The  al-Mirghani  family  continues  to  exercise  control  over  the 
brotherhood. 

Mahdi — A  messianic  figure  expected  to  come  at  the  end  of  time  to 
institute  an  Islamic  society  of  peace  and  justice.  In  Sudan,  Muhammad 
Ahmad  ibn  al-Sayyid  Abdallah  of  Dongola  declared  himself  to  be  the 
Mahdi  in  about  1880. 

Mahdism — A  movement  similar  to  a  religious  order  founded  in  the  late 
nineteenth  century.  Mahdism  and  its  adherents,  the  Ansar,  sought  the 
regeneration  of  Islam. 

Muslim  Brotherhood — Founded  by  Hasan  al-Banna  in  Egypt  in  the  1920s, 
it  was  originally  conceived  as  a  religious  revivalist  movement  seeking  a 
return  to  the  fundamentals  of  Islam  in  a  way  that  would  be  compatible 
with  the  technological  innovations  introduced  from  the  West.  It  has  been 
active  in  Sudan  since  1949.  Disciplined,  highly  motivated,  and  well 
financed,  “the  Brotherhood,”  as  it  is  known,  became  a  powerful  political 
force  during  the  1970s  and  1980s,  although  it  represented  only  a  small 
minority  of  Sudanese.  Following  the  1989  coup,  the  Brotherhood  exerted 
influence  through  the  National  Islamic  Front,  which  held  several  cabinet 
portfolios.  Its  members  are  now  split  between  the  National  Congress 
Party  and  the  Popular  Congress  Party. 

Sahel — A  narrow  band  of  land  bordering  the  southern  Sahara  and 
stretching  from  Senegal  in  the  west  into  Sudan  in  the  east.  It  is 
characterized  by  an  average  annual  rainfall  of  between  1 50  and  500 
millimeters  and  is  mainly  suited  to  pastoralism. 


404 


Glossary 


Salafi — Refers  to  the  early  generations  of  Muslims.  Salafist  Muslims 
believe  that  the  closer  a  generation  was  to  the  time  of  the  Prophet,  the 
more  correct  was  its  understanding  of  Islam. 

Shi’a  (from  Shiat  Ali ,  the  “Party  of  Ali”) — A  member  of  the  smaller  of 
the  two  great  divisions  of  Islam.  The  Shi’a  supported  the  claims  of  Ali 
ibn  Abi  Talib,  the  Prophet’s  son-in-law,  and  his  line  to  presumptive 
right  to  the  caliphate  and  leadership  of  the  Muslim  community.  On 
this  point,  they  divided  from  the  Sunni  (q.v.)  in  the  first  great  schism 
within  Islam.  Later  schisms  have  produced  further  divisions  among 
the  Shi’a  over  the  identity  and  number  of  their  imams,  spiritual  leaders 
descended  from  Ali.  There  are  no  Shi’a  in  Sudan. 
shura — A  consultative  body  that  can  give  advice  and  counsel.  It  may 
take  the  form  of  a  parliament.  Islamists  reject  the  notion  of  popular 
sovereignty,  which  belongs  only  to  God.  Hence,  a  shura  does  not 
express  sovereignty  but  only  the  principle  of  community  consensus. 
Sudanese  dinar  (SDD) — The  unit  of  currency  from  May  1992  until  July 
1, 2007,  when  it  was  replaced  by  the  (new)  Sudanese  pound  {q.v.). 
Sudanese  pound  (SDG) — Until  1992,  the  unit  of  currency  was  the  Sudanese 
pound  (SDP),  consisting  of  1,000  millimes  =  100  piasters  =  1  Sudanese 
pound.  In  May  1992,  the  al-Bashir  government  replaced  the  pound  with 
the  dinar  (SDD),  at  SDD1  =  SDG  10.  The  dinar  existed  in  parallel  with 
the  pound  until  the  dinar  officially  replaced  the  pound  in  March  1 999. 
The  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  of  January  2005  called  for  a  new 
unit  of  currency  to  replace  the  dinar,  which  Southerners  associated  with 
the  regime’s  Arabization  policies.  On  January  9,  2007,  the  Bank  of 
Sudan  put  the  new  Sudanese  pound,  divided  into  100  piasters,  into 
circulation.  The  new  pound  equals  100  dinars,  or  1,000  old  Sudanese 
pounds.  As  of  July  1,  2007,  the  exchange  rate  was  US$1  =  SDD204  = 
SDG2.  As  of  that  date,  the  dinar  was  no  longer  legal  tender  in  Sudan.  On 
September  1, 2014,  the  exchange  rate  was  US$1  =  SDG5.68. 
sudd — Arabic  term  for  “barrier”  or  “obstruction.”  With  lower  case,  the 
term  designates  clumps  of  aquatic  vegetation  that  block  the  Nile 
channel;  with  upper  case,  the  term  Al-Sudd  is  used  loosely  for  the 
entire  White  Nile  swamps  in  Southern  Sudan. 

Sufism — Islamic  mysticism.  Brotherhoods  of  Sufis,  or  mystics,  exist 
throughout  the  Muslim  world.  In  Sudan,  the  Khatmiyyah,  the 
Qadiriyyah,  and  the  Tijaniyyah  are  examples  of  major  brotherhoods. 
Sunni  (from  the  Arabic  sunna ,  meaning  “custom,”  giving  the  connotation 
of  orthodoxy  in  theory  and  practice) — A  member  of  the  larger  of  the 
two  great  divisions  of  Islam.  Sunnis  supported  the  traditional  method 


405 


Sudan:  A  Country  Study 


of  election  to  the  caliphate  and  accepted  the  Umayyads,  whose  dynasty 
succeeded  the  Prophet  Muhammad.  On  this  issue,  they  divided  from 
the  Shi’a  (g.v.)  in  the  first  great  schism  within  Islam.  There  are  no  Shi’a 
in  Sudan. 

Three  Towns— Sudanese  reference  to  the  cities  of  Khartoum,  Khartoum 
North,  and  Omdurman.  Located  in  close  proximity  to  the  juncture  of  the 
White  Nile  and  Blue  Nile  Rivers,  they  form  a  single  metropolitan  area. 

Wahhabi — Reformist  reactionary  Islamic  group,  named  after  its  founder, 
Ahmed  Abd  el-Wahhab  (1703-92),  son  of  a  theologian  from  the  Najd 
region  of  Saudi  Arabia.  Wahhabism  is  the  official  Islamic  creed  of 
Saudi  Arabia.
