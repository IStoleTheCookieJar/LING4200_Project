19.  ABSTRACT  (Continue  on  reverse  if  necessary  and  identify  by  block  number) 

'jJThe  development  and  testing  of  training  programs  for  combat  vehicle  identification  was 
conducted  from  1980-1986  under  the  Target  Acquisition  and  Analysis  Training  System  (TAATS) 
work  unit  at  Fort  Hood,  Texas.  During  that  time  ]5  independent  research  projects  were  com¬ 
pleted.  This  research  evaluated  the  programs  as  well  as  a  variety  of  factors  related  to 
training  program  performance,  e.g.,  motion,  alternate  media,  retention,  and  repeated  train¬ 
ing.  The  Manpower  and  Personnel  Integration  (MANPRINT)  initiative  motivated  the  exploration 
of  the  magnitude  and  validity  of  relationships  between  Armed  Services  Vocational  Aptitude 
Battery  (ASVAB)  and  vehicle  identification  performance.  Comparable  vehicle  identification 
performance  data  from  those  efforts  exist  for  942  soldiers;  ASVAB  scores  and  vehicle  identi¬ 
fication  performance  data  from  those  efforts  exist  for  about  600  soldiers.  These  relation¬ 
ships  were  examined  using  (1)  unweighted  Pearson  correlations;  (2)  correlations  of  perfor¬ 
mance  with  individual  differentially  weighted  ASVAB  scores;  (3)  multiple  correlations 
involving  different  ASVAB  scaled  scores  and  subtests;  and  (4)  discriminant  analyses  to 
predict  high  and  low  achieving  soldiers.  .  j  1  i  'f-  (Continued)  ^

FOREWORD 


As  part  of  a  research  task  titled  Target  Acquisition  and  Analysis 
Training  System  (TAATS),  the  Fort  Hood  Field  Unit  of  the  U.S.  Army  Research 
Institute  for  the  Behavioral  and  Social  Sciences  (ARI)  developed  a  series  of 
target  recognition  and  identification  (R&I)  training  programs.  Both  Training 
and  Doctrine  Command  (TRADOC)  and  Forces  Command  (FORSCOM)  recognized  the  need 
for  standardized  R&I  training  and  requested  that  ARI  develop  such  programs. 
With  the  support  of  the  Combined  Arms  Center  (CAC),  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas, 
15  independent  research,  development,  and  evaluation  (RDE)  efforts  were 
completed  in  the  1980-1986  period. 

With  the  increasing  importance  of  the  Manpower  and  Personnel  Integration 
(MANPRINT)  initiative,  ARI  has  emphasized  investigation  of  the  relationship 
between  performance  measures  and  soldier  scores  on  the  Armed  Services 
Vocational  Aptitude  Battery  (ASVAB) — a  battery  of  scaled  scores  and  suhtests 
used  by  the  Army  for  selection  and  assignment  of  personnel.  Data  from  various 
military  units  during  those  RDE  efforts  was  useful  in  developing  a  large  and 
reliable  database  of  soldier  vehicle  identification  performance.  The  relative 
ease  of  obtaining  ASVAB  data  for  a  large  proportion  of  these  soldiers  made  it 
possible  and  desirable  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  ASVAB  scores 
and  vehicle  identification  performance.

RELATIONSHIPS  BETWEEN  VEHICLE  IDENTIFICATION  PERFORMANCE  AND  THE  ARMED 
SERVICES  VOCATIONAL  APTITUDE  BATTERY  (ASVAB) 


EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY 


Requirement: 

Current  Army  emphasis  on  the  Manpover  and  Personnel  Integration 
(MANPRINT)  initiative  to  aid  in  the  development  of  Army  systems  stresses  the 
importance  of  understanding  the  relationships  between  soldier  performance  and 
aptitude.  In  this  spirit  the  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  explore  the 
relationship  between  one  criterion  performance  measure--vehicle  identification 
accuracy  and  Armed  Services  Vocational  Aptitude  Battery  (ASVAB)  scores  as 
predictor  variables. 


Procedure: 

Data  suitable  for  the  analyses  were  obtained  for  942  soldiers  from  11  of 
the  15  independent  research  projects  conducted  within  the  scope  of  the  Target 
Acquisition  and  Analysis  Training  System  (TAATS)  work  unit  at  Fort  Hood,  Texas 
from  1980  to  1986. 

Prior  to  initiating  this  evaluation,  a  database  of  common  information  was 
designed  and  constructed.  For  each  soldier  trained,  ASVAB  scaled  (standard) 
scores  and  subtest  scores  were  obtained.  These  data  were  used  in  a  series  of 
correlational  and  discriminant  analyses  to  determine  the  relationships  that 
exist  between  vehicle  identification  performance  and  soldier  aptitude  (ASVAB). 
Analyses  included  unweighted  (Pearson)  correlations,  correlations  based  on 
differentially  weighting  scale  values  of  each  ASVAB  scaled  score  and  subtest, 
multiple  correlations  that  used  combinations  of  ASVAB  scores,  and  discriminant 
analyses  to  predict  high  (upper  two-thirds)  versus  low  vehicle  identification 
performance  soldiers.  Since  the  reliability  of  vehicle  identification 
performance  scores  (the  criterion  measure)  was  quite  high  (r  *  .88),  no 
correction  for  attenuation  of  correlations  was  necessary. 


Findings: 

Correlations  based  on  equally  weighted  scores  for  individual  ASVAB  scaled 
scores  and  subtests  are  in  the  high  .20s  and  low  .30s. 

When  ASVAB  scores  for  individual  scaled  sores  and  subtests  are 
differentially  weighted,  modest  increases  (of  about  .05)  in  the  absolute  value 
of  the  correlations  may  be  obtained. 


vii 


Multiple  correlations  involving  more  than  one  ASVAB  scaled  score  or 
subtest  are  comparable  to  correlations  obtained  by  the  differential  weighting 
of  scores  for  individual  ASVAB  scaled  scores  and  subtests. 

Soldiers  who  will  score  "high"  or  "low"  in  vehicle  identification 
performance  can  be  identified  in  advance  about  75X  of  the  time  by  using 
quadratic  discriminant  functions  involving  ASVAB  scaled  scores. 

Supplementary  analyses  involving  use  of  random  sample  halves  generally 
confirm  the  validity  of  relationships  reported. 


Utilization  of  Findings: 

The  quadratic  discriminant  functions  described  in  this  report  may  be  used 
by  the  Army  as  a  tool  to  assist  in  selecting  soldiers  for  MOS  where  vehicle 
identification  ability  is  (or  is  not)  important.

RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  VEHICLE  IDENTIFICATION  PERFORMANCE  AND 
THE  ARMED  SERVICES  VOCATIONAL  APTITUDE  BATTERY  (ASVAB) 


Introduction 

Current  Army-wide  and  Army  Research  Institute  (ARI)  management  emphasis  on 
the  Manpower  and  Personnel  Integration  (MANPRINT)  initiative  to  aid  in  the 
development  of  Army  systems  stresses  the  importance  of  understanding  the 
relationships  between  soldier  performance  and  aptitude.  In  this  spirit  the 
purpose  of  the  present  report  is  to  explore  the  relationship  between  one 
criterion  performance  measure — vehicle  identification  accuracy  and  Armed 
Services  Vocational  Aptitude  Battery  (ASVAB)  scores  as  predictor  variables. 

Conceptually,  the  Target  Acquisition  and  Analyses  Training  System  (TAATS ) 
has  included  within  its  domain  the  goal  of  achieving  a  better  understanding  of 
human  performance  in  the  entire  target  acquisition  process — target  detection, 
recognition,  identification  (R&I),  and  tactical  analysis.  From  1980  to  1986 
under  the  TAATS  umbrella,  a  series  of  Combat  Vehicle  Identification  (CVI) 
programs  were  developed,  tested  and  adopted  by  the  Army.  A  key  feature  of 
these  programs  was  the  presentation  of  photopic  (daylight)  images  of  friendly 
and  threat  vehicles  at  simulated  battlefield  ranges.  In  order  to  conduct  the 
evaluation  of  the  various  aspects  of  these  programs,  generally  three  views  of 
each  of  five  vehicles  were  trained  in  a  single  training  period;  such  a  grouping 
of  vehicles  constituted  a  training  module.  For  each  of  the  training  evaluation 
efforts  conducted,  a  single  training  session  involved  training  soldiers  with 
between  two  and  six  modules.  In  the  training,  the  images  were  presented  and 
the  instructor  would  indicate  /ey  features  of  the  vehicle  that  were  visible  at 
the  simulated  ranges.  Each  of  the  program  evaluation  efforts  involved 
presenting  tests  with  two  to  five  images  of  each  of  the  vehicles  trained.  For 
the  effort  described  herein,  criterion  data  from  results  obtained  in  eleven 
research  efforts  were  used.  Specifically,  the  criterion  data  used  were  the 
vehicle  identification  performance  scores  on  a  test  given  after  completion  of 
one  training  session.  In  each  of  these  efforts  It  was  possible  to  use  as  the 
performance  (criterion)  measure,  the  number  of  photopic  images  correctly 
identified  for  vehicles  trained  in  three  modules  with  two  views  (a  front  and  an 
oblique)  per  vehicle.  Performance  scores  so  obtained  had  a  possible  range  of 
0-30.  In  the  course  of  testing  during  these  eleven  research  efforts, 
performance  measures  were  collected  for  942  soldiers.  These  eleven  efforts 
were  designed  to  assess  training  effectiveness  under  several  conditions, 
including:  (1)  effects  of  vehicle  motion  during  training;  (2)  task  complexity; 
(3)  relative  effectiveness  of  training  with  different  training  media;  and  (4) 
the  importance  of  retraining  on  acquisition  and  recall  of  vehicle 
identification  skills.  The  eleven  efforts  involved  using  soldiers  stationed  in 
units  throughout  Continental  United  States  (CONUS),  U.S.  Army  in  Europe 
(USAREUR)  and  U.S.  Army  South  (S0UTHC0M). 

Method 

Development  of  the  Combat  Vehicle  Identification  Master  Data  Base 

As  noted  earlier,  work  by  the  Fort  Hood  Field  Unit  over  the  past  several 
years  has  involved  several  independent  data  collection  efforts  in  which 
soldiers  were  trained  and  tested  for  their  ability  to  recognize  and  identify 
(R&l)  friendly  and  enemy  combat  vehicles.  Under  the  sponsorship  of  the 


1 


Combined  Arms  Center  (CAC)  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  TAATS  was  engaged  in  the 
development  and  evaluation  of  these  programs.  Within  a  systems  context,  many 
of  those  research  efforts  resulted  in  performance  data  reflecting  R&I 
knowledges.  When  the  role  of  the  Fort  Hood  Field  Unit  of  ARI  in  this  effort 
was  discontinued,  it  appeared  desirable  to  develop  a  MASTER  data  base  which 
contained  data  elements  common  to  the  various  TAATS  research  efforts. 

Generally,  these  elements  fall  into  three  classes:  1)  Background  and 
demographic  characteristics;  2)  Performance — specifically  number  of  photopic 
images  correctly  identified;  and  3)  Aptitude  measures  (ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and 
Subtests).  The  process  involved  in  development  of  this  data  base  as  a 
Statistical  Analysis  Software  (SAS)  data  set  required  examination  of  the 
individual  data  bases  for  fifteen  coordinated  research  and  development  efforts 
in  the  TAATS  program.  Based  on  that  review,  only  those  performance  data  common 
to  eleven  of  those  research  efforts  were  included.  For  example,  in  some  efforts  the 
posttraining  test  involved  exposure  to  two  views  of  each  vehicle  while  in  other 
studies  three  and  five  were  used.  To  increase  the  comparability  of  performance 
data,  only  the  posttraining  test  responses  to  images  of  vehicles  in  the  two 
commonly  presented  views  (front,  left  or  right  oblique)  were  used  to  define  the 
identification  performance  (criterion)  measure.  ^ 

Following  development  of  the  performance  and  background  and  demographic 
characteristics  of  the  MASTER  data  base  in  the  spring  of  1986,  a  request  was 
made  to  obtain  ASVAB  Composites  and  Subtest  scores. ^  ASVAB  Composite  scores 
were  standardized  (scaled)  scores  while  Subtest  scores  received  were  in  raw 
score  form.  In  order  to  provide  a  measure  of  standardization  for  Subtest 
scores  based  on  different  numbers  of  items,  all  Subtest  scores  were  converted 
to  percentages  prior  to  any  analyses.  Tables  1  and  2  list  the  ASVAB  Subtests 
found  in  different  forms  of  this  test  and  the  particular  Subtests  used  in 
defining  each  Composite  measure. 

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  task  required  of  the  soldier,  i.e., 
identification  of  a  vehicle,  is  relatively  complex.  Identification  as  defined 
throughout  the  TAATS  research  is  naming  or  giving  the  number  of  the 
vehicle — for  example,  T-62,  Bradley,  or  Leopard.  Embodied  in  this  response  is 
the  implicit  knowledge  that  the  vehicle  is  a  "Friend"  or  "Threat"  and  that  it 
falls  into  one  of  several  classes  of  vehicles — for  example,  tank,  armored 
personnel  carrier  or  self-propelled  gun.  A  substantial  part  of  the  task  was 
cognitive  in  combination  with  simple  rote  learning  and  perception. 


^A  complete  description  of  this  data  base,  including  variables  used,  is  available 
from  the  ARI  Fort  Hood  Field  Unit  on  request. 

^Composite  scores  are  computed  by  combining  two  or  more  Subtest  scores  in 
various  combinations.  For  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the  Armed  Forces 
Qualification  Test  (AFQT)  is  considered  a  composite.  The  ASVAB  data  used  in  all 
analyses  was  received  from  the  Manpower  Data  Center  in  Monterey,  California, 
with  backup  support  from  the  Manpower  Personnel  Research  Laboratory  of  ARI.

Characteristics  of  Soldiers  Included  In  the  Master  Database 


While  missing  data  precludes  use  of  the  entire  sample  of  soldiers  in  all 
analyses,  it  is  nevertheless  relevant  to  provide  generally  descriptive  data 
along  several  dimensions.  These  data  speak  to  the  relative  heterogeneity  of 
soldier  sample  studied.  Characteristics  of  the  sample  described  Include: 

1)  Military  Occupational  Speciality  (MOS)  (See  Table  3);  2)  Rank  (See  Table  4); 

3)  Racial  and  Ethnic  Background  (See  Table  5);  4)  Education  (See  Table  6);  5) 

Age  (See  Table  7);  6)  Service  Time  (See  Table  8);  and  7)  Time  in  MOS  (See  Table 
9).  In  addition  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  22.8  %  (_n  “  211)  of  soldiers 
included  in  this  data  base  used  glasses  on  the  job;^  11.1%  (n  **  100)  used  them 
for  reading  only.^  Finally,  the  vast  majority  of  soldier  sample  were  males 
(96.5%,  n  =  828). 5 

It  is  important  to  note  that  it  was  generally  beyond  the  scope  of  this  effort  to 
explore  performance  and  aptitude  relationships  for  particular  soldier 
characteristics  categories. 

Data  Analysis 


This  effort  had  two  primary  objectives:  1)  to  explore  the  relationship 
between  vehicle  identification  performance  and  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  or  Subtest 
scores  and  2)  to  provide  analyses  which  document  the  validity  of  the 
relationships  obtained.  In  addressing  these  objectives,  four  analytic  techniques 
were  used:  1)  Correlations  of  individual  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  Subtests  with 
soldier  vehicle  identification  performance,  2)  multiple  correlations  between 
soldier  vehicle  identification  performance  and  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  or  Subtests 
as  predictor  variables,  3)  correlations  of  differentially  weighted  scores  of 
ASVAB  predictor  variables  with  vehicle  identification  performance,  and  4) 
discriminant  analyses. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  in  this  effort  analyses  were  generally 
performed  using  data  from  ASVAB  Test  Forms  5-7,  8-14  and  5-14  for  random  halves 
of  soldiers  for  which  data  were  available,  and  the  entire  set  of  data  available. 
Separate  analyses  for  different  ASVAB  test  forms  were  motivated  by  the  general 
understanding  that  there  are  rather  major  differences  in  test  structure  for 
ASVAB  versions  beginning  with  test  form  8  compared  with  earlier  ASVAB  versions. 
Analyses  for  random  halves  were  completed  primarily  to  address  the  validity  of 
findings  reported.  The  procedure  used  in  forming  random  halves  involved 
sorting  soldiers  by  Social  Security  Number  and,  in  the  case  of  the  discriminant 
analyses,  also  involved  sorting  soldier  identification  performance  scores.  In 
each  case,  data  from  the  first,  third,  fifth,  etc.,  soldiers  constituted  the  ODD 
half;  the  remaining  cases  the  EVEN  half.

-’Data 


concerning  use  of  glasses  on  job  is  missing  for  16  soldiers, 
concerning  use  of  glasses  for  reading  is  missing  for  41  soldiers, 
on  soldiers'  sex  missing  for  84  cases. 


5 


For  correlations  involving  differentially  weighted  ASVAB  predictor 
variables  (Scaled  Scores  and  Subtests),  all  available  data  were  used;  separate 
analyses  for  different  ASVAB  test  forms  were  not  performed.  In  order  to  assign 
weights  for  categories  of  each  ASVAB  predictor  variable,  frequency  tabulations 
were  first  performed  for  each  predictor  value.  From  these  tabulations 
categories  of  values  were  formed  so  that  each  category  would  be  represented  by 
approximately  15  to  20  observations  for  ODD  and  EVEN  random  samples®.  in  turn, 
weights  which  maximized  the  correlation  between  each  ASVAB  predictor  and 
vehicle  identification  performance  were  obtained  for  the  complete  sample  as 
well  as  ODD  and  EVEN  halves.^  Further,  weights  were  assigned  to  categories  of 
each  predictor  variable  so  that  15  to  20  observations  existed  for  each  category 
of  the  total  sample.  In  this  latter  case,  weights  for  a  larger  number  of 
categories  were  used  as  additional  fitting  constants.  In  order  to  address  the 
validity  of  these  correlations,  the  weights  obtained  for  ODD  and  EVEN  halves 
were  used  to  compute  the  correlations  for  the  complete  sample. 


Low  correlations  are  sometimes  found  because  the  criterion  itself  is 


unreliable.  This  is  usually  a  result  of  poorly  defined  measurements,  use  of 
overly  subjective  judgements,  inadequately  trained  data  collectors, 
uncalibrated  equipment,  or  some  combination  of  these  factors.  In  order  to 
assure  that  findings  reported  here  were  not  attenuated  by  low  reliability  of 
criterion  variable — identification  performance — results  of  two  consecutive  post 
training  tests  with  no  intervening  training  were  correlated  yielding  a  retest 
reliability  of  .88.®  Applying  the  correction  for  attenuation  to  the  criterion 


described  by  Guilford  produced  negligible  changes  in  correlations  involving 
ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  Subtests  with  identification  performance.^ 


Consequently,  correlations  reported  have  not  been  corrected  for  the  very  slight 


unreliability  they  manifest. 


®In  the  context  of  multiple  correlational  analyses,  Herzberg  (1969)  indicated 
that  to  obtain  stable  correlations — across  other  samples — there  should  be  about 
15  to  20  observations  per  weight  estimated;  i.e.,  with  N  as  sample  size  and  K 
the  number  of  weights  estimated,  the  N/K  ratio  should  approach  20.  See 
Herzberg,  P.A.  The  parameters  of  cross-validation.  Psychometrika  Monograph 
Supplement .  1969,  No.  16. 

^Weights  were  estimated  by  a  computer  algorithm  utilizing  "pattern  search."  The 
function  minimized  was  1  -  |  r  |.  See  C.F.  Wood  "Recent  Developments  in 
Direct  Search  Techniques".  Westinghouse  Research  Laboratories,  Research  Report

size  (N)  and  for  ODD  and  EVEN  halves  a  Z  statistic  to  assess  the  significance 
of  differences  between  correlations.*^  Including  the  correlations  for  ODD  and 
EVEN  halves  as  well  as  those  based  on  the  total  sample,  all  but  three  are 
significantly  different  from  zero;  all  of  the  correlations  based  on  the  total 
sample  are  statistically  significant.  The  range  of  correlations  obtained  using 
test  forms  5-7  is  .246  (for  the  CL  Composite)  to  .354  (for  the  SC  Composite); 
for  test  forms  8-14  the  range  is  .119  (for  the  CL  Composite)  to  .289  (for  the 
ST  Composite).  For  all  test  forms  the  range  is  .212  (for  the  CL  Composite)  to 
.336  (for  the  GM  Composite).  This  means  that  between  1.4%  and  12.5%  of  the 
variability  between  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  identification  performance  is  in 
common . 

In  a  similar  manner  Table  11  presents  the  same  information  as  Table  10  but 
for  ASVAB  Subtests.  For  several  Subtests — NO,  CS,  AD,  CM,  CA,  CE,  and 
CC — correlations  with  identification  performance  are  not  significantly 
different  from  zero.  The  range  of  correlations  obtained  using  test  forms  5-7 
which  are  significant  range  from  .156  (for  SP  Subtest)  to  .351  (for  GI 
Subtest);  for  test  forms  8-14,  the  range  for  those  which  are  significant  is 
.179  (for  El  Subtest)  to  .295  (for  GS  Subtest).  For  all  test  forms,  the  range 
of  significant  correlations  is  .156  (for  SP  Subtest)  to  .351  (for  GI  Subtest). 
Again  this  means  that  between  2.4%  and  12.3%  of  the  variability  between  ASVAB 
Subtests  and  identification  performance  is  in  common. 

As  noted  in  the  METHOD  section,  separate  analyses  for  test  forms  5-7  and 
8-14  were  performed  because  of  the  understanding  that  there  were  rather  large 
substantive  changes  beginning  with  test  form  8  compared  to  earlier  forms.  Table 
12  shows  the  correlations  for  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  the  seven  Subtests  common 
to  most  test  forms  with  identification  performance.  While  in  every  case  the 
correlations  using  test  forms  5-7  scores  are  higher  in  absolute  value  than 
comparable  correlations  involving  test  forms  8-14,  only  in  one  case  (SC 
Composite)  did  the  Z  test  for  testing  significance  of  differences  among 
correlations  prove  statistically  significant  (j>  <  .05).  With  18  comparisons, 
one  statistically  significant  difference  could  occur  by  chance  about  5%  of  the 
time. 


It  was  also  noted  in  the  METHOD  section  that  in  order  to  assess  the 
validity  of  the  obtained  correlations,  the  data  were  divided  into  random  halves 
with  comparison  of  correlations  for  each  half  serving  as  a  measure  of  the 
validity  of  the  relationship  reported.  In  Tables  10  and  11  there  are  a  total 
of  67  different  comparisons.  In  these  67,  four  proved  to  have  significantly 
different  Z  values  at  the  .05  level  or  better.  Since  4/67  x  100  is 
approximately  6%  and  there  was  no  a  priori  expectation  that  the  obtained 
correlations  for  random  halves  would  differ  significantly,  it  seems  reasonable

to  believe  that  these  four  correlations  which  differ  significantly  are  due  to 
chance.  This  interpretation  in  turn  leads  to  an  inference  that  the  obtained 
relationships  are  indeed  valid. 

Multiple  Correlation  Relationships  Involving  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  or  Subtests  as 
Predictors  and  Identification  Performance  as  Criterion 


Procedure  for  Analyses  Involving  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  [Composites  and  Armed 
Forces  Qualification  Test  (AFQT)}.  As  with  correlations  involving  individual 
ASVAB  Scaled  Scores,  multiple  correlations  were  obtained  generally  for  random 
halves  of  the  data.  Such  analyses  were  designed  to  address  the  matter  of 
validity  of  obtained  relationships — when  sample  sizes  were  sufficiently  large 
to  satisfy  Herzberg's  criterion  for  obtaining  stable  multiple  correlation 
relationships  across  different  samples. 

Multiple  correlation  relationships  involving  the  ten  area  Aptitude 
Composites  and  AFQT  (ASVAB  Scaled  Scores)  with  identification  performance  are 
summarized  in  Table  13.  Since  with  11  predictor  variables  there  are  2047 
possible  predictor  sets  for  predicting  the  criterion,  it  is  reasonable  to 
consider  only  selected  sets  for  both  describing  and  validating  relationships 
which  exist.  As  with  individual  predictor  and  criterion  correlations,  separate 
analyses  were  performed  with  test  form  5-7  data,  8-14  and  5-14  for  the  total 
sample.  In  each  of  these  cases  PROC  STEPWISE  from  the  SAS  package  was  used  to 
select  the  best  set  from  the  11  predictor  variables.  The  predictor  set 
selected  was  the  one  which  satisfied  Mallow's  criterion — Cp  statistic — as 
described  in  the  SAS  manual.  Results  of  these  analyses  are  presented  in  row  1, 
columns  4,  7,  and  10  of  Table  13.  As  noted  in  each  case  the  best  predictor  set 
involved  a  single  Aptitude  Area  (AA)  Composite.  In  order  to  address  the 
question  of  the  validity  of  the  obtained  relationships,  the  total  sample  in 
each  case  was  randomly  divided  into  halves  and  the  correlations  involving  that 
single  AA  composite  with  the  criterion  were  computed  using  PROC  RSQUARE  from 
SAS.  Results  of  those  analyses  are  shown,  as  indicated,  in  row  1  of  Table  13. 

While  statistically  the  best  subset  of  predictor  variables  involved  only 
one  AA  Composite,  it  was  of  some  interest  to  examine  changes  in  absolute 
multiple  correlation  magnitude  that  might  result  with  use  of  larger  predictor 
subsets . 

Rather  than  explore  all  subsets,  it  was  decided  to  examine  the  "best” 
subset  of  six  predictors  for  each  case.  A  subset  size  of  six  was  selected  as 
the  sample  size  in  each  random  half  would  be  sufficiently  large  according  to 
Herzberg  (1969)  to  obtain  reasonably  stable  multiple  correlational 
relationships.  "Best,"  again  was  defined  as  that  subset  which  satisfied 

**With  N  as  the  sample  size  and  K  the  number  of  predictor  variables,  Herzberg 
(1969)  indicated  that  to  obtain  stable  multiple  correlations — across  other 
samples — the  N/K  ratio  should  approach  20,  i.e.,  there  should  be  approximately 
20  observations  per  weight  estimated.  See  Herzberg,  P.A.  The  Parameters  of 
Cross-Validation.  Psychometrika  Monograph  Supplement,  1969,  No.  16. 

^Mallow's  criterion  for  selection  of  a  "best"  multiple  correlation  relationship 
involves  selecting  the  model  with  the  predictor  variables  which  first  lead  the 
Cp  statistic  to  approach  £  (the  number  of  weights  estimated,  excluding  the 
intercept).  See  SAS  User's  Guide:  Statistics,  Version  5,  pp.  765-766  for  more 
detailed  discussion.

Mallow's  criterion  when  the  total  sample  was  used.  Using  only  ASVAB  scaled 
scores  from  Test  Forms  5-7,  the  best  subset  of  six  involved  the  EL,  GT,  CL,  OF, 
CO  and  MM  Aptitude  Area  scaled  scores  with  an  R  of  .400  (see  row  2,  column  4, 
Table  13).  The  multiple  correlations  involving  this  subset  of  predictors  were 
computed  to  produce  all  other  entries  in  row  2.  Using  only  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores 
from  test  forms  8-14,  the  best  subset  of  six  involved  the  ST,  CL,  SC,  CO,  OF 
and  AFQT  scaled  scores  with  an  R  of  .341  (see  row  3,  column  7,  Table  13).  As 
before,  the  multiple  correlations  involving  this  subset  of  predictors  was 
computed  to  produce  other  entries  in  row  3.  Finally  row  4  shows  the  multiple 
correlations  which  results  when  all  11  Scaled  Scores  are  used — for  random 
halves  and  total  sample.  Multiple  correlations  involving  all  11  Scaled  Scores 
were  not  computed  for  test  forms  5-7  or  8-14  individually  since  the  N/K  ratios 
(per  Herzberg,  1969)  were  not  sufficiently  large  to  obtain  stable  correlational 
values. 

Based  on  review  of  Table  13  it  appears  that  the  multiple  correlation 
approach  does  not  produce  any  marked  improvement  in  the  demonstrated 
relationships  between  individual  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  the  criterion 
variable — although  in  all  cases  when  Herzberg's  (1969)  guidance  is  followed 
there  is  no  evidence  to  conclude  that  the  relationships  obtained  are  not  valid. 

Procedure  for  Analyses  Involving  ASVAB  Subtests.  Multiple  correlational 
analyses  involving  ASVAB  Subtests  in  many  ways  parallels  analyses  for  ASVAB 
Scaled  Scores  discussed  above — separate  analyses  for  data  involving  test  forms 
5-7,  8-14  and  5-14  using  the  total  samples  and  for  each  random  half  (See  Table 
14).  In  each  case  analyses  presented  are  consistent  with  Herzberg's  (1969) 
guidance  that  approximately  20  observations  per  predictor  be  available. 
Generally,  results  shown  in  the  first  four  rows  of  Table  14  were,  in  part, 
based  on  use  of  PROC  STEPWISE  of  SAS  package.  The  specific  procedure  used  for 
each  of  those  rows  will  be  described  momentarily.  In  reviewing  Table  14  it  is 
important  to  understand  that  in  ASVAB  test  forms  5-7  there  are  16  Subtest 
scores;  for  te6t  forms  8-14  there  are  eleven.  For  test  forms  5-14  there  are 
seven  common  Subtests.  Results  presented  in  rows  1-3  and  5  of  Table  14 
consider  only  these  seven  common  Subtests  as  predictors — for  comparability 
across  analyses  as  well  as  to  reflect  sensitivity  to  Herzberg's  (1969)  guidance 
noted  above. 

For  results  presented  in  row  1,  PROC  STEPWISE  of  SAS  was  used  to  identify 
the  best  subset  of  predictors  using  the  total  sample  available  for  those 
soldiers  who  had  been  given  one  of  ASVAB  test  forms  5-7.  As  in  discussion  of 
the  comparable  6et  of  analyses  involving  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores,  Mallow's 
criterion*3  was  used  to  select  the  "best"  subset  (See  row  1,  column  4,  Table 
14).  Other  results  presented  in  row  1  address  the  issues  of  validity  and 
generality  of  findings  using  other  data. 

For  results  presented  in  row  2  (Table  14)  the  ''best"  subtest  of  predictors 
using  the  total  sample  available  for  soldiers  given  one  of  ASVAB  test  forms 
8-14  involved  a  single  Subtest  (See  column  7).  As  before,  other  results 
presented  in  row  2  address  the  issues  of  validity  and  generality  of  findings.

Results  presented  in  row  3,  column  10,  Table  14)  represent  the  "best" 
subset  of  the  common  7  Subtest  predictors  which  Involved  all  available  data 
(Test  Forms  5-14).  Again,  as  before,  other  results  cited  in  row  3  address 
issues  of  validity  and  generality  of  findings  with  different  data. 

Results  presented  in  row  4  (table  14)  indicate  the  "best"  subset  of 
Subtest  predictors  using  all  available  Subtests  for  the  particular  ASVAB  test 
forms  indicated.  Again,  results  for  random  halves  address  the  issue  of 
validity. 

Finally  results  presented  in  row  5  (Table  14)  present  the  multiple 
correlations  involving  all  common  7  Subtest  predictors.  These  results  were 
obtained  by  using  PROC  RSQUARE  of  SAS. 

Major  Findings.  For  correlations  involving  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores 
(Composites  and  AFQT)  the  best  predictor  set  is  defined  by  a  single  Composite 
(GM)  with  a  magnitude  of  about  .36  (Table  13).  A  multiple  correlation  of 
comparable  magnitude  (.35)  is  obtained  for  a  Subtest  predictor  set  of  4  (NO, 

CS,  MK,MC)  out  of  seven  Common  Subtests  when  data  from  all  test  forms  (5-14) 
are  used  (Table  14). 

It  is  particularly  encouraging  to  note  that  none  of  the  Z  tests  which 
compare  multiple  correlations  for  random  halves  are  significant.  As  with 
findings  involving  individual  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  Subtests,  this  finding  is 
consistent  with  an  inference  concerning  the  validity  of  the  reported 
relationships . 

Differential  Weighting  Correlations 

In  attempting  to  determine  the  relationship  among  predictive  and  criterion 
variables,  it  seems  reasonable  to  ask  whether  weighting  different  values  of  the 
predictor  variables  by  values  other  than  one  might  improve  the  apparent 
relationship.  As  repeatedly  emphasized  in  this  report  the  concern  has  been  on 
both  documenting  the  relationships  as  well  as  providing  results  which  point  to 
the  validity  of  those  relationships.  The  METHOD  section  has  described  the 
procedure  used  and  the  rationale.  For  each  ASVAB  Scaled  Score  or  Subtest, 
Tables  15  and  16  show:  1)  the  different  correlations  computed;  2)  the  F  test 
which  assesses  the  statistical  significance  of  the  correlations,  3)  the  sample 
size  (Ip  on  which  the  correlation  is  based;  4)  the  number  of  weights  (K) 
estimated  in  computing  the  correlations;  and  5)  where  appropriate,  Z  tests  to 
assess  the  significance  of  differences  among  correlations.  In  order,  by 
numbered  column,  Tables  15  and  16  show:  1)  the  ASVAB  Scaled  Score  or  Subtest; 

2)  columns  2  through  6  show  correlations  when  the  total  sample  of  available 
data  is  used;  and  3)  columns  7  and  8  are  based  on  ODD  and  EVEN  halves  of  the 
data,  respectively.  Column  2  shows  the  standard  Pearson  correlations  where 
each  predictor  variable  score  is  weighted  by  1.  Columns  3  and  4  show  modified 
Pearson  correlations  where  weights  for  different  categories  of  predictor 
variable  scores  have  been  estimated  so  as  to  make  the  reported  correlations  a 
maximum;  correlations  reported  in  column  4  generally  use  almost  twice  as  many 
categories  as  for  the  correlations  reported  in  column  3.  Correlations  reported 
in  columns  7  and  8  were  computed  using  the  same  categories  for  the  predictor 
variables  as  used  for  correlations  reported  in  column  3  but  for  random  halves 
of  the  data.  Category  weights  estimated  for  correlations  reported  in  columns  7

Note :  Predictor  variable  categories  and  weights  estimated  for  each  category  will 
be  provided  on  request. 

a  The  significance  of  difference  among  weighted  and  unweighted  correlations  was 
estimated  with  the  £  statistic.  For  these  evaluations 

F  -  [(R2!  ~  R22)  /  ~  K2)]  /  [(1“R2]_)  /  (N  -  Kx  -  1)],  with  £  evaluated  on 

Kj-  K2  and  N-K^-l  degrees  of  freedom. 

k  Only  the  slope  coefficient  used  in  computing  the  usual  Pearson  correlation  was 
estimated  in  this  computation.  Predictor  variable  scores  were  transformed  with 
weights  estimated  during  calculation  of  correlations  reported  in  the  last  two 
columns  of  this  table. 

c  Superscripts  for  these  correlations  which  are  the  same  indicate  no  significant 
differences — £>.05 — ;  where  superscripts  are  different,  ££.05.  See  McNemar,  Q., 
Psychological  Statistics,  John  Wiley  and  Sons,  Inc.  (3rd  Edition)  1962,  p.  284.

tabled  correlations. 

^  Number  of  weights  estimated  includes  weights  for  each  predictor  variable 
category  of  weighted  correlations  plus  the  slope  coefficient  used  in  computing 
the  Pearson  correlation. 

R  The  significance  of  difference  between  independent  correlations  based  on  ODD 
and  EVEN  sample  halves  was  estimated  with  Z  statistic.  For  these  evaluations

and  8  for  ODD  and  EVEN  sample  halves,  respectively,  were  used  to  compute 
correlations  for  the  total  sample  reported  in  columns  5  and  6.  The  correlations 
reported  in  column  2  are  also  found  in  Tables  10  and  11.  They  have  been  repeated 
here  to  facilitate  comparisons  with  the  differentially  weighted  correlations. 

Inspection  of  Table  15  indicates  that  the  Scaled  Score  correlations 
obtained  (weighted  and  unweighted)  are  generally  statistically  significant  (£ 

<.05).  Except  for  the  NO,  CS,  AD,  CM,  CA  and  CE  Subtests,  the  same  conclusion  is 
reached  from  review  of  Subtest  correlations  in  Table  16.  In  almost  every  case  using 
estimated  weights  to  selected  categories  of  ASVAB  predictors  does  lead  to  increases 
in  the  absolute  value  of  the  obtained  correlations.  Generally  use  of  more  weights 
leads  to  increases  in  the  absolute  value  of  resulting  correlations. 

For  each  of  the  31  ASVAB  predictors  (Scaled  Scores  and  Subtest  Scores),  a 
total  of  93  correlations  were  subjected  to  evaluation  for  test  of  significance 
differences — three  correlations  per  predictor.  As  noted  above,  one  of  these 
correlations  was  the  simple  unweighted  (Pearson)  correlation;  the  remaining  two 
were  Pearson-type  correlations  obtained  for  weighted  aptitude  values  and 
performance.  Only  for  the  OF  Composite  Scaled  Score  did  differential  weighting  lead 
to  a  statistically  larger  (£<.05)  correlational  value  compared  to  the  unweighted 
correlation.  Differential  weighting  led  to  significantly  larger  correlations  for 
the  GS,  AS,  GI  and  CC  Subtests.  Of  the  93  comparisons,  ten  were  statistically 
significant . 

In  order  to  address  the  validity  of  correlations  obtained  with  differential 
weighting  (columns  3  and  4,  Tables  15  and  16),  correlations  (with  weighting)  were 
obtained  for  ODD  and  EVEN  halves  of  randomly  sorted  data  (columns  7  and  8,  Tables 
15  and  16)  and  then  the  weights  (for  predictor  variable  categories)  estimated 
during  the  computational  procedure  were  used  to  compute  Pearson-type  correlations 
for  the  entire  set  of  available  data  (columns  5  and  6,  Tables  15  and  16).  Tables 
15  and  16  show  the  results  of  Z  tests  used  to  assess  the  significance  of 
differences  in  correlations  for  each  ASVAB  scale.  For  the  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  no 
significant  differences  in  correlations  for  ODD  and  EVEN  halves  occurred;  for  the 
ASVAB  Subtests  seven  of  the  40  comparisons  reported  were  statistically  significant 
(£<  .05)  . 

Discriminant  Analyses 

As  research  with  the  CVI  Training  Systems  progressed,  it  became  increasingly 
apparent  that  the  acquisition  of  R&I  skills  is  a  difficult  task  and  retention  is 
low.  Given  these  circumstances  and  the  importance  of  R&I  skills  on  the  modern 
battlefield,  it  seemed  relevant  in  earlier  research  (Smith  et  al.  1987a,  Smith  et 
al  1987b)  to  ask  about  the  importance  of  individual  soldier  capability  differences. 
Large  standard  deviations  of  performance  indicated  a  large  amount  of  individual 
performance  variability.  In  the  cited  research  this  observation  prompted  a  closer 
look  at  the  performance  of  individual  soldiers  who  had  been  exposed  to  repeated 
training.  Examination  of  scatterplots  of  identification  performance  following  the 
first  training  session  and  subsequent  sessions  seemed  to  indicate  that  soldiers  who 
performed  relatively  poorly  after  the  first  session  tended  to  show  smaller 
performance  increases  with  subsequent  training.  These  initial  impressions  led  to 
more  definitive  analyses  in  which  soldier  performance  following  the  first  training 
session  served  as  a  basis  for  categorizing  them  as  "low"  or  "high"  achievers.

Using  several  categorization  criteria,  the  performance  curves  of  these 
achievement  groups  with  repeated  training  were  plotted.  While  different 
criteria  did  lead  to  absolute  differences  in  performance  curves,  inspection  of 
those  curves  for  most  criteria  generally  indicated  that  "low"  achievers  take 
about  three  to  four  training  sessions  to  attain  a  performance  level  attained  by 
"high"  achievers  following  one  such  session.  With  this  background,  our 
research  effort  here  asked  the  question  whether  "low"  and  "high"  achievers 
could  be  differentiated  with  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  or  Subtests. 

As  in  previous  analyses  reported  above,  the  intent  in  these  analyses  was 
not  only  to  compute  the  mathematical  correlations  of  ASVAB  scores  of  the  sample 
with  CVI  performance,  but  also  to  provide  evidence  for  the  validity  of  the 
reported  relationships.  Again,  as  before,  separate  analyses  were  performed  for 
ASVAB  data  collected  with  test  forms  5-7,  8-14  and  5-14.  In  each  case,  these 
data  were  sorted  first  by  social  security  number  and  then  by  identification 
performance  score.  For  these  analyses,  "low"  achievers  were  defined  as 
soldiers  scoring  in  the  lower  third  of  all  soldiers  for  whom  both  ASVAB  and 
performance  data  were  available.  It  is  generally  understood  that  In  the 
research  community  a  "high”  category  is  viewed  as  the  upper  portion  of  a 
distribution.  The  term  "high”  in  this  effort  was  used  to  define  the  top  two 
thirds  simply  as  a  way  of  providing  a  contrasting  label  (to  "low")  to  indicate 
that  the  analyses  are  concerned  with  dichotomous  groups.  In  each  case  a  random 
half  of  soldiers  falling  in  the  "low"  achiever  and  "high"  achiever  group  were 
combined  to  form  constrained  random  sample  halves.  With  each  set  of  test 
forms,  one  of  these  halves  was  used  as  a  "calibration"  sample — to  develop  the 
discriminant  model — once  with  the  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  again  for  ASVAB 
Subtests.  These  discriminant  models  were  then  used  to  classify  the  other 
random  half.  Finally  the  best  discriminant  model  for  the  entire  sample  was 
developed  for  each  case.^  Tables  17,  18  and  19  summarize  the  classification  of 
soldiers  for  each  analysis,  the  "HIT"  race  and  the  F^  test  to  address  the 
validity  of  the  discriminant  model  developed  for  one  random  half  (calibration 
sample)  in  being  able  to  categorize  the  test  data  from  the  other  random  half. 

A  HIT  is  defined  as  the  case  where  the  discriminant  model  assigns  a  soldier  to 
the  same  category  to  which  his  identification  performance  led  him  to  be 
classified.  First  to  be  noted  from  these  tables  is  the  fact  that  the 
discriminant  models  developed  on  the  "calibration"  sample  were  about  equally 
valid  for  classifying  the  test  half  of  the  data.  While  the  models  were  valid, 
their  accuracy  in  correct  classification  (HITS)  ranged  from  61%  to  80%  when 
random  halves  of  the  data  are  considered.  Considering  only  the  results  for  the 
entire  sample,  the  "HIT"  rate  ranged  from  68%  to  77%. 

One  way  in  which  discriminant  analyses  could  prove  useful  to  the  Army  is 
in  the  area  of  MOS  assignment.  Once  an  individual  has  completed  the  ASVAB 
prior  to  service  entry,  his  classification  as  a  "Low"  achiever  in  vehicle 
identification  could  serve  as  a  basis  for  counseling  the  individual  into  an  MOS 
where  R&I  is  not  especially  important.  Alternately,  the  results  of  the 
discriminant  analysis  might  be  used  by  the  Army  as  one  criterion  which 
determines  a  soldier's  eligibility  to  be  assigned  an  MOS  where  vehicle 
identification  ability  is  especially  important.  Further,  with  the  many  unit 

^Analyses  were  performed  using  PROC  DISCRIM  in  SAS  with  the  PRIORS  variable 
defined  as  Low  ■  1/3,  High  *  2/3  and  with  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  linear 
or  quadratic  discriminant  function  was  most  useful.

decide  on  who  should  or  should  not  receive  (repeated)  R&l  training.  In  order 
to  provide  the  Army  with  this  capability,  the  weights  used  in  the  ASVAB 
discriminant  model  must  be  provided  (See  Appendix  B) .  In  examining  the 
results  summarized  in  Tables  17-19,  it  appears  that  the  discriminant  models 
involving  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  for  test  forms  5-7  and  8-14  provide  the  highest 
expected  accuracy  for  classifying  soldiers — in  each  case  a  quadratic 
discriminant  function  proved  best.  For  soldiers  who  took  one  of  test  forms 
5-7,  the  expected  classification  accuracy  ("HIT"  rate)  is  75%;  for  those  who 
took  one  of  forms  8-14,  the  "HIT"  rate  is  77%.  These  functions  and  a  brief 
description  of  their  use  is  found  in  Appendix  B.

Discussion 


Individual  Correlation  Relationships 

In  the  analyses  reported  here,  the  intent  was  to  explore  in  several  ways 
the  relationship  between  the  criterion  variable  (vehicle  identification 
performance)  and  predictor  variables  (ASVAB  Scaled  and  Subtest  scores).  Concern 
was  focused  not  only  upon  the  magnitude  of  the  relationship  but  also  upon  the 
validity  of  findings  reported.  Within  chance  expectations,  the  obtained 
relationships  were  concluded  as  valid — whether  ASVAB  Scaled  Score  or  Subtests 
were  used  with  forms  5-7  or  8-14.  For  the  correlations  between  criterion  and 
individual  predictors,  values  obtained  indicated  that,  depending  on  which 
predictor  is  used,  between  1%  and  13%  of  the  variability  between  criterion  and 
predictors  Is  in  common.  Obviously  there  is  a  great  deal  of  criterion 
variability  which  must  be  accounted  for  by  other  factors.  For  ASVAB  Scaled 
Scores,  the  range  of  obtained  correlations  is  .212  (for  CL  Composite)  to  .336 
(for  GM  Composite);  for  ASVAB  Subtests  this  range  is  .156  (for  SP  Subtest)  to 
.358  (for  GI  Subtest).  Other  research  (Maier  &  Grafton,  1981,  and  Weltin  and 
Popelka,  1983)  using  final  course  grades  and  the  CL  ASVAB  Composite  and  related 
Subtests  with  homogeneous  Army  samples  generally  report  substantially  higher 
correlations  (.50-. 78)  than  those  obtained  in  the  present  research.  It  is 
generally  recognized  that  the  greater  the  similarity  of  content  between 
criterion  and  predictor  measures,  the  larger  the  observed  relationship  will  be. 
Even  without  detailed  criteria  analysis,  it  is  not  difficult  to  conclude  that 
items  in  the  final  course  exam  for  clerical  training  courses  are  probably  more 
similar  to  ASVAB  Subtest  items  which  define  the  CL  Composite  than  the  processes 
which  are  involved  in  the  complex  visual  perceptual  discrimination  task  used  in 
this  research.  It  is  well  known  that  when  the  range  of  scores  being  used  in 
computing  a  correlation  is  narrow,  the  magnitude  of  the  correlation  is 
attenuated.  Attributing  differences  in  the  magnitude  of  the  correlations 
presented  here  compared  to  other  studies  (utilizing  specific  MOS  Army  samples) 
as  possibly  due  to  a  restricted  range  of  scores  on  the  predictor  variables  is 
not  probable.  Since  other  studies  reported  generally  used  soldiers  in  a  single 
MOS,  it  is  more  likely  that  there  would  be  a  restriction  of  range  of  predictor 
scores  for  soldiers  in  those  samples  than  in  the  heterogeneous  set  of  MOSs 
which  comprised  the  sample  for  the  current  work.  Consistent  with  this 
judgement,  it  is  further  relevant  to  state  the  rather  obvious  fact  that  the 
utility  of  the  ASVAB  (as  currently  designed)  as  a  predictor  will  vary  for 
different  criterion  skills  which  define  competency  in  different  MOSs.  The 
question  asked  should  not  be  "Is  the  ASVAB  a  valid  predictor  of  Army 
performance"?  but  rather,  "For  what  Army  performance  is  the  ASVAB  a  valid 
predictor?"  Beyond  this  point  it  is  appropriate  to  conduct  additional  research 
aimed  at  identifying  new  ASVAB  Composites  which  relate  to  other  Army  skills. 
Such  research  probably  would  naturally  involve;  1)  Trying  different  Subtest 
combinations;  2)  developing  Subtest  item-criterion  correlations  as  a  basis  for 
using  specific  items  from  different  Subtests  to  develop  new  Composites;  and  3) 
the  development  of  new  Subtests  which  Include  items  which  would  appear  to 
relate  better — have  greater  "face  validity" — to  the  criterion  for  which  a 
predictor  is  desired. 


Multiple  Correlation  Relationships 


When  the  stepwise  regression  procedure  was  used  as  a  basis  for  selecting 
"optimum"  multiple  correlation  relationships  as  opposed  to  an  a  priori  model, 
the  most  general  finding  was  that  adding  ASVAB  predictors  into  linear 
combinations  generally  does  not  result  in  significant  improvements  in 
relationship  between  criterion  and  predictors  over  use  of  Individual 
predictors.  When  one  examines  the  relatively  high  correlation  between 
predictors  (See  Appendix  A)  and  notes  the  relatively  low  correlations  between 
individual  ASVAB  predictors  and  the  criterion,  this  finding  is  not  surprising. 
It  is  generally  recognized  in  the  test  and  evaluation  community  that  these  are 
the  conditions  which  tend  to  make  use  of  the  multiple  correlation  approach  less 
profitable. 

Beginning  with  an  a  priori  model,  Horne's  (1986)  work  includes  use  of  a 
multiple  correlation  approach  (instrumental  variable  regression)  to  explore  the 
relationship  between  written  and  hands-on  tests  used  by  Army  training  schools 
for  different  MOS  samples  for  several  systems  and  the  predictors  selected  for 
the  model.  While  the  focus  of  the  current  research  effort  has  not  been  on 
examining  the  role  of  demographic/background  variables,  in  order  to  provide 
some  basis  for  comparing  the  present  results  with  Horne's,  a  similar  type  of 
analysis*®  was  used  with  the  data  in  the  CVI  Master  Data  Base.  It  is  important 
to  note  that  results  of  the  analysis  presented  here  using  Horne's  (1986)  model 
speak  only  to  the  comparability  of  conclusions  reached  by  Horne  when  another 
performance  variable  is  used.  There  is  no  intent  to  imply  that  the  conclusions 
reached  from  this  analysis  in  the  present  research  (or  Horne's)  are  valid.  A 
model's  validity  necessarily  depends  on  the  underlying  assumptions  on  which  the 
model  is  based.  Embodied  in  those  assumptions  are  the  variables  used,  how  the 
categories  of  those  variables  are  defined  and  the  mathematical  relationships 
used  to  relate  those  variables.  For  example,  it  is  not  clear  but  that  had 
Horne's  model  included  more  than  binary  categories  for  the  education,  training 
and  race  variables,  the  conclusions  reached  might  well  have  been  different — for 
his  data  as  well  as  that  used  in  the  present  work.  Variables  In  the  Horne  model 
and  for  CVI  data  are  shown  below  in  Table  20.  From  review  of  this  table  it  is 
noted  that  except  for  the  performance  and  training  variables,  the  variables 
used  in  developing  the  multiple  regression  relationships  are  identical.  Use  of 
a  different  performance  (criterion)  variable  tests  the  generalizability  of 
Horne's  findings  to  a  different  set  of  competency  skills.  For  the  training 
variable  it  was  reasoned  that  when  a  soldier  is  assigned  to  a  duty  MOS  which  is 
the  same  as  his  assigned  MOS,  he  is  developing  his  skills  in  that  MOS.  It  is 
Army  policy  to  test  soldiers  in  their  assigned  MOS  regardless,  and  not  in  their 
duty  assignment.  Significance  tests  for  predictor  coefficients  of  the  Horne 
(1986)  model  with  the  vehicle  identification  performance  criterion  variable  is 
shown  in  Table  21  below.

of  the  criterion  variable. 


Results  presented  in  Table  21  for  the  CV1  data  are  generally  consistent 
with  findings  for  Horne's  (1986)  analyses.  Specifically,  AFQT  and  rank  are 
consistent  performance  predictors.  Consistent  with  results  of  the  present 
analysis  and  as  was  frequently  found  by  Horne  (1986),  differences  based  on 
diploma  status,  MOS  training  and  race  were  not  significant  performance 
predictors.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  resultant  multiple  correlation 


39 


obtained  (See  Table  21)  with  entry  of  background/demographic  variables  results 
in  no  appreciable  predictive  improvement  over  that  obtained  by  the  best  ASVAB 
Scaled  Scores  or  Subtest  alone. 

Differential  Weighting  Correlations 

As  noted  from  review  of  Tables  15  and  16,  there  were  increases  in  the 
absolute  value  of  Pearson-type  correlations  when  different  predictor  values 
receive  their  own  weight.  Since  more  of  these  differences  were  statistically 
significant  than  might  be  expected  by  chance,  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that 
in  some  cases  differential  weighting  will  be  effective  in  demonstrating  an 
increase  in  the  relationship  between  performance  and  aptitude  variables. 

Further  research  to  document  the  efficacy  of  the  differential  weighting 
procedure  is  warranted. 

In  order  to  address  the  validity  of  the  differentially  weighted 
correlations,  two  procedures  were  used.  First,  differentially  weighted 
correlations  were  obtained  for  random  halves  of  the  data  for  each  ASVAB 
predictor.  These  correlations  speak  to  the  replicability  of  findings  across 
independent  samples.  A  second  procedure  involved  using  the  weights  estimated 
for  each  half  to  compute  a  correlation  for  the  entire  sample.  As  noted,  for 
the  Composites,  no  significant  differences  occurred;  however,  several  were 
significantly  different  for  ASVAB  Subtests — more  than  might  be  expected  by 
chance.  It  might  be  concluded  that  differentially  weighted  correlations  are 
valid  for  Composites  which  are  scaled  scores  but  not  Subtests  which  are 
percentages.  It  is  not  clear  whether  these  conflicting  findings  can  be 
attributed  to  differences  in  the  type  of  variable  used.  Of  the  seven  cases 
where  differential  weighting  correlations  for  random  halves  do  differ 
significantly,  neither  of  the  correlations  for  (or  based  on)  random  halves  have 
a  magnitude  which  is  significantly  greater  than  zero  for  five  of  these  cases. 

It  might  be  concluded  that  it  is  unreasonable  to  test  for  significant 
differences  among  two  values  which  are  in  themselves  not  significant.  For  the 
remaining  35  comparisons,  two  show  a  significant  difference.  With  alpha  set  at 
.05,  approximately  two  such  differences  could  be  expected  by  chance. 

Discriminant  Analyses 

Perhaps  the  most  important  finding  of  this  research  effort  is  the  fact 
that  soldiers  can  be  assigned  a  priori  to  low  and  high  vehicle  identification 
achievement  groups  with  about  75%  accuracy  using  a  quadratic  discriminant 
function  involving  only  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores.  Were  background  and  demographic 
variables  also  introduced  into  the  discriminant  analysis,  additional 
achievement  classification  improvement  might  result.  Again,  the  inclusion  of 
demographic  and  background  factors  were  generally  beyond  the  scope  of  the 
present  research  effort.  Discriminant  functions  might  be  best  suited  for  use 
in  guiding  new  soldiers  into  MOSs  where  combat  vehicle  identification  is  or  is 
not  an  especially  critical  skill.

Conclusions 


Correlations  based  on  equally  weighted  scores  for  individual  ASVAB  Scaled 
Scores  and  Subtests  are  in  the  high  .20s  and  low  .30s. 

When  ASVAB  scores  for  individual  Scaled  Scores  and  Subtests  are 
differentially  weighted,  modest  increases  (of  about  .05)  in  the  absolute  value 
of  the  correlations  may  be  obtained. 

Multiple  correlations  involving  more  than  one  ASVAB  Scaled  Score  or 
Subtest  are  comparable  to  correlations  obtained  by  the  differential  weighting 
of  scores  for  individual  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores  and  Subtests. 

Soldiers  who  will  score  "high"  or  "low"  in  vehicle  identification 
performance  can  be  identified  in  advance  about  75%  of  the  time  by  using 
quadratic  discriminant  functions  involving  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores. 

Supplementary  analyses  involving  use  of  random  sample  halves  generally 
confirm  the  validity  of  relationships  reported.

Appendix  B 

Assignment  of  Individuals  to  Low  and  High  Vehicle 
Identification  Achiever  Classes 

Predictions  of  Low  vs  High  Vehicle  Identification  Achievers 

As  noted  in  the  text,  when  an  individual  has  completed  his  ASVAB  test,  a 
recruiter  might  find  it  useful  to  use  these  results  as  a  basis  for  counseling  a 
potential  soldier  into  an  MOS  which  does/does  not  require  heavy  emphasis  on 
vehicle  identification.  Alternately  a  trainer  may  wish  to  use  ASVAB  scores  as  a 
basis  for  deciding  who  should  receive  repeated  R&I  training  and  who  might  best 
be  assigned  to  perform  some  other  unit  function.  The  first  thing  a  trainer  must 
do  is  to  determine  whether  the  ASVAB  scores  available  for  a  soldier  were  obtained 
with  any  of  test  forms  5-7  or  8-14.  Since  test  forms  5-7  of  the  ASVAB  are  no 
longer  used,  a  recruiter  does  not  have  this  decision.  In  order  to  provide  a 
basis  for  predicting  apriori  whether  an  individual  is  a  high  or  low  vehicle 
identification  achiever,  two  discriminant  function  values  must  be  computed — one 
assuming  the  ASVAB  scores  are  for  a  LOW  achiever  and  another  assuming  the  ASVAB 
scores  are  for  a  HIGH  achiever.  These  discriminant  functions  are  computed 
"generalized  square  distances."  The  decision  rule  is  to  categorize 
the  individual  to  the  "achiever  class"  for  the  discriminant  function  which  has 
the  largest  value. 

For  soldiers  who  have  taken  one  of  the  ASVAB  form  5-7  the  discriminant 
functions  to  be  computed  follow:

In  each  case  the  category  into  which  the  model  places  the  individual  is  for  the 
equation  yielding  the  highest  value.  In  using  these  discriminant  functions  for 
categorization  it  probably  will  be  desirable  to  have  the  equations  programmed 
onto  a  floppy  disk  for  use  with  a  desk  top  computer.  Input  would  involve 
simply  entering  the  eleven  ASVAB  Scaled  Scores,  perhaps  as  directed  by  a  menu.
