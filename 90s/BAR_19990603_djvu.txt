Devotion 

over 

dollars 

by Jim Provenzano 


I t is called, in philanthropic terms, 
“adventure fundraising.” 

It seems that events that raise 
money must be entertaining, even 
at the expense of losing focus on the 
charity. The oft-repeated AIDS rider 
response that is meant to excuse mul¬ 
tiple alleged and fined financial abus¬ 
es: “It was a life-changing experience.” 

Surprisingly this phrase, like so 
many others, hasn’t been trade- 
marked by Pall'dtta TeamWorks, the 
for-profit company whose expenses at 
AIDS Rides iri the last two years have 
been the subject of criticism from gay 
publications and cancer and AIDS 
groups nationwide. 

But what makes AIDS riders de¬ 
fend their event by saying that it is 
“beyond dollars?” 

To understand the faithful devo¬ 
tion, it is important io learn about the 
source of inspiration that even AIDS 
Ride founder Dan Pallotta has cited in 
publications where he deigned to be 
interviewed. It is called The Hunger 
Project, a creation worthy of compar¬ 
ison.

D rag entertainer Charles Pierce, the “Mas¬ 
ter and Mistress of Surprise or Dis¬ 
guise,” died peacefully in his North Hol¬ 
lywood home on Monday evening, May 
31. He had been battling cancer, complicated 
with a stroke. He was 76. 

Pierce’s career included acting and radio 
announcing, but it was as a female imper¬ 
sonator that he left his audiences weak with 
laughter, and brightened their lives with his 
wicked and sometimes irreverent impres¬ 
sions of film stars including Bette Davis, Joan 
Crawford, Tallulah Bankhead, Carol Chan- 
ning, Katharine Hepburn, and even “Mrs. 
Olsen” of the Folgers coffee commercials. 

During his illustrious career, Pierce was 
toasted by celebrities around the world, in¬ 
cluding Tommy Tune, Anita Loos, Beatrice 
Arthur, Eugenia Bankhead (the sister), the In¬ 
comparable Hildegarde (with whom he ap¬ 
peared at Town Hall in New York), and 
Stephen Sondheim. In the mid-1990s he re¬ 
tired, having lost his manager and dresser to 
the AIDS epidemic. He made a few appear¬ 
ances for special events, such as author/actor 
Charles Busch’s highly successful Town Hall 
drag summit show in New York City, which 
featured Milton Berle and all the best drag 
acts. (Busch, who is working on a film, could 
not be reached for comment). In the last cou¬ 
ple of years, Charles gathered together all his 
scrapbooks, photographs, programs, record¬ 
ings and videotapes and shipped them to the

United Airlines, Mies lose suit 
against SF domestic partner law 


by Cynthia Laird 


S an Francisco’s landmark equal benefits 
ordinance withstood two legal chal¬ 
lenges last Thursday, May 27 when a fed¬ 
eral court judge upheld the ordinance in 
one case and ruled that United Airlines must 
provide no-cost benefits such as bereavement 
leave, family leave, and flight discounts for 
registered domestic partners of employees. 

United and S.D. Myers, Inc. (SDMI), an 
Ohio-based company represented by Pat 
Robertson’s American Center for Law and 
Justice (ACLJ), sued the city over the ordi¬ 
nance, which requires companies that do 
business with the city to offer the same ben¬ 
efits to domestic partners of employees that 
they offer to employees’ spouses. 

U.S. District Court Judge Claudia Wilken 
ruled in April 1998 that because airlines are 
federally regulated, they do not have to offer 
health and pension benefits. United, howev¬ 
er, fought the ruling, arguing it shouldn’t 
have to provide even no-cost benefits. In her 
decision last week, Wilken rejected that ar¬ 
gument, but left in place a preliminary in¬ 
junction preventing the city from enforcing 
the ordinance against the airline. 

Dennis Aftergut, chief assistant city attor¬ 
ney, said if United keeps fighting the ordi¬ 
nance, the city will “vigorously oppose” the in¬

junction remaining. It is not known whether 
the airline will appeal; the company has until 
Friday, June 4 to submit its motion. Federal 
Express, which joined United in the suit, also 
has until then to file court documents. In the 
case of Federal Express, Aftergut said other 


no-cost benefits include sending flowers if a 
spouse dies, and package discounts.

Shepard’s mom to 
Cal legislators: 
Pass Kuehl’s bill 


by M.R. Richards 
B.A.R. Capitol 
Correspondent 


s Assembly Bill 222 fights 
| i for its life in Sacramento, 
s ■ i struggling against unprece¬ 
dented hate campaigns, the moth¬ 
er of murdered student Matthew 
Shepard has sent a plea that even 
the most hardened homophobes 
will have a hard time ignoring. 

Judy Shepard is supporting AB 
222, authored by Assembly¬ 
woman Sheila Kuehl, (D-Santa 
Monica). Kuehl’s bill has been tar¬ 
geted by a vicious media cam¬ 
paign. The bill would add the 
words “sexual orientation” to the 
sections of the Education Code 
which protect students from other 
forms of discrimination. The cur¬ 
rent California Code states that 
every student has the right to ed¬ 
ucational opportunity without re¬ 
gard to “race, creed, color, reli¬ 
gion, national origin, sex, or eco¬ 
nomic status” and AB 222 would 
merely add the words “sexual ori¬ 
entation” to that list. 

There has been a hue and cry 
of outrage from the radical reli¬ 
gious right, led by Lou Sheldon of 


the Traditional Values Coalition, 
who is bombarding the airwaves 
and newspapers in marginal dis¬ 
tricts of newly elected Democrats. 
Phone banks, routing calls to leg¬ 
islators’ district offices, have been 
traced as coming through 
Louisiana into California. Kuehl 
flatly stated that the “exaggeration 
and outright lies are taking advan¬ 
tage of people of faith by taking 
their money for this media cam¬ 
paign over two simple words.” 

The newly elected Democratic 
legislators have been inundated by 
calls and demonstrations in their 
home districts which have been so 
virulent that one legislator who 
has a gay son has even voted 
against the bill. 

' Judy Shepard, hearing of this, 
sent members of the State Assem¬ 
bly the following letter: 

“Dear Member of the Califor¬ 
nia State Assembly, Though I am 
not a California resident, I am writ¬ 
ing to you as a mother who has lost 
her son due to anti-gay prejudice. 
It is my hope that you will seize the 
opportunity before you, in the 
form of AB 222, to help protect 
America’s youth in public schools. 

“It is no secret that teenagers 
are often incredibly cruel to peers 


who are perceived as different. 
Whether the bullying is based on a 
child’s disability, race, religion, or 
sexual orientation, it is inexcus¬ 
able. Gay, lesbian and bisexual 
youth have historically been targets 
of school-yard abuse, both verbal 
and physical. It is time for parents, 
legislators, and community leaders 
to take the first steps toward pro¬ 
tecting all of our children, as they 
strive each day to learn and grow. 

“As you might know, my son 
Matthew was murdered last fall by 
two young men who spit anti-gay 
epithets at him, even as they beat 
him to death. If legislation such as 
AB 222 had existed in my home 
state of Wyoming, perhaps these 
troubled young men would have 
learned a fundamental respect for 
all people. Nothing will bring 
back Matthew, but this legislation 
has to power to spare any other 
parents from suffering as my hus¬ 
band and I have. 

“As bias motivated hate-vio¬ 
lence continues to escalate at an 
alarming rate, we as a community 
must come together and take im¬ 
mediate action. I implore you to 
support this legislation..” 

AB 222 is pending a vote on 
the Assembly floor. ▼

Leno’s beer bust 
hearing postponed 


by Mark Norby 


upervisor Mark Leno has 
had to postpone the June 3 
hearing on beer busts and 
beer benefits, because the matter 
was not listed on the Small Busi¬ 
ness, Economic Vitality, and Con¬ 
sumer Services Committee’s agen¬ 
da in accordance with open meet¬ 
ing laws when it was approved by 
Supervisor Gavin Newsom’s of¬ 
fice; Newsom chairs the commit¬ 
tee. The hearing has been moved 
to Thursday, June 17 at City Hall. 

The hearing will address the 


state Alcoholic Beverage Control 
(ABC) agency’s action to close 
down beer busts and benefits at 
San Francisco gay bars, starting 
with the Lone Star Saloon. The 
benefits are designed to raise 
money for AIDS service organiza¬ 
tions (ASOs). ABC targeted the 
events because they “promote un¬ 
controlled drinking,” according to 
Michael Tyrel of ABC. This state¬ 
ment has raised concern in the 
gay community that ABC is tar¬ 
geting gay bars in particular. 

The ABC action calls into 
question citywide events where 
“host bars” and “open bars” are 


part of the function. “Whether it’s 
an event at the opera, or the Black 
and White Ball, or the Sheraton 
Hotel’s unlimited champagne 
brunch,” said Lone Star attorney 
Jeffrey Gibson, “it is the bar¬ 
tenders and waiters that serve the 
drinks, and not the ASO.” Tyrel 
did not return calls asking for a 
clarification of the difference be¬ 
tween the Black and White Ball 
and beer busts. 

Lone Star’s owner Kevin 
Owens and a large contingent of 
the bar’s patrons are expected to 
be present at the hearing, which is 
open to the public. T 


Mayor unveils $4.2 billion spending plan 


by Cynthia Laird 


/ an Francisco’s robust econ- 
omy has led to flush city fi- 
% I nances, Mayor Willie Brown 
told the Board of Supervisors 
Tuesday, June 1 when he present¬ 
ed his proposed $4.2 billion bud¬ 
get for the 1999-2000 fiscal year 
that starts July 1. The board’s fi¬ 
nance committee will soon begin 
holding public hearings on the 
budget before it is finalized. This 
year’s spending plan represents an 
increase of 7.7 percent over last 
year’s budget, and includes a $25 
million general fund reserve. 

The mayor, who plans to kick 
off his re-election bid June 12, 
told the supervisors that his pro¬ 
posed budget is again balanced. 
He stressed quality of life issues 


such as increased police protec¬ 
tion, and more money for parks 
and recreation during his address 
to the supervisors. The troubled 
Muni transportation system was 
also discussed by the mayor, who 
said his budget plan includes an 
additional $15 million to reverse 
a decade of budget cuts and ne¬ 
glect. By the end of the year, 
Brown said 150 new trains and 
buses will be on city streets. 

Brown’s budget includes a 5.8 
percent increase in the city’s gen¬ 
eral fund to $1.8 billion, up from 
$1.7 billion last year. General fund 
dollars are used for a variety of 
city services, including public 
health. In terms of the Depart¬ 
ment of Public Health (DPH), 
Brown proposed a $22 million in¬ 
crease for San Francisco General 
Hospital (SFGH) to replace lost 


federal reimbursements and fund 
services for an increased hospital 
patient population. Another 
$800,000 has been budgeted for 
improved staffing at SFGH’s 
pharmacy, which experienced 
lengthy delays earlier this year 
after the satellite pharmacy was 
closed. Additionally, funding was 
continued for the city’s work 
entry and re-entry program for 
people living with HIV/AIDS. 

Another area of particular in¬ 
terest to the city’s lesbian, gay, bi¬ 
sexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
community is the LGBT Commu¬ 
nity Center Project, for which the 
city has already allocated $2.75 
million. The mayor’s proposed 
budget calls for another expendi¬ 
ture of $3.2 million as the city’s 
share to get the project complet¬ 
ed by next year. ▼

LGBT programs get 
$391K from SF 
Foundation 


by Cynthia Laird 


I % ay Area lesbian, gay, bisexu¬ 
al, and transgender (LGBT) 
' organizations got a boost 
last Wednesday, May 26 when the 
Gateway Initiative, a partnership 
between the San Francisco Foun¬ 
dation and the Horizons Founda¬ 
tion, announced grants totaling 
$391,528 to 37 agencies to fund a 
variety of programs and services. 
A few non-gay groups received 
grant money for gay-specific pro¬ 
gramming, but mostly it was 
LGBT organizations that received 
the grants; the checks will go out 
in the next few weeks. 

The Gateway Initiative is the 
Bay Area component of the Na¬ 
tional Lesbian and Gay Commu¬ 
nity Funding Partnership, a col¬ 
laborative of funders interested in 
integrating issues of concern to 
the LGBT communities in philan¬ 
thropic institutions nationally. 
The collaborative came together 
following a study by the Working 
Group on Gay and Lesbian Issues 
that showed that despite proven 
need in LGBT communities, less 
than .03 percent of all private, 
community, and corporate foun¬ 
dation dollars are being invested 
in the queer community. 

In the first of two rounds of 
grantmaking to Bay Area organi¬ 
zations, the Gateway Initiative is 
providing grants to strengthen 
LGBT organizations’ capacity and 
to develop programs in a variety 
of areas, including health, well¬ 
ness, civil rights, education, and 
the arts. For many groups, these 
grants mark the first time they 
have received foundation funding. 

Amy Schoenborn, coordinator 
for the initiative, told the Bay Area 
Reporter that the second round of 
grants will probably occur at the 
end of the year. The San Francisco 
Foundation anticipates requests 
for proposals being available in 
August or September. 

Schoenborn, who’s worked for 
two years developing the project, 
said part of her job involved creat¬ 
ing opportunities for the San 
Francisco Foundation to get in 
touch with the LGBT community. 
“We’ve increased our grantmaking 
by 300 percent,” she said, adding 
the foundation has used resources 
to create a bridge as well as edu¬ 
cate local nonprofits about grants 
that may be available to them. 

“The partnership between the 
San Francisco Foundation and the 
Horizons Foundation is an exciting 
opportunity to connect these im¬ 
portant organizations to the fund¬ 
ing community,” said Dr. Sandra 
Hernandez, chief executive officer 
of the San Francisco Foundation. 
Hernandez, a Latina lesbian, was 
previously the city’s health director. 


There are several objectives of 
the initiative, one of which is to 
challenge the San Francisco Foun¬ 
dation to become more perma¬ 
nently responsive to the LGBT 
community, and to build long¬ 
term relationships with queer or¬ 
ganizations. The community 
foundation was founded in 1948 
and serves Alameda, Contra 
Costa, Marin, San Francisco, and 
San Mateo counties. With assets of 
more than $600 million, the orga¬ 
nization is one of the largest com¬ 
munity foundations in the coun¬ 
try. Last year, foundation trustees 
awarded more than $45 million in 
grants to 3,500 grantees. 

Peter Teague, the openly gay 
executive director of the Horizons 
Foundation, said the significance 
of his organization’s partnership 
with the San Francisco Founda¬ 
tion is “that it opens the door of 
mainstream funding to more 
LGBT organizations than ever be¬ 
fore.” The Horizons Foundation 
was started in 1979, and is a grant¬ 
making organization. 

In addition to the two founda¬ 
tions, an advisory committee of 
25 people involved in the LGBT 
and philanthropic communities 
have worked to implement the 
initiative. Schoenborn said there 
are many reasons to fund gay and 
lesbian issues, including the fact 
that discrimination continues to 
exist against the LGBT communi¬ 
ty. Even in San Francisco, general¬ 
ly considered by many to have a 
tolerant attitude toward gays, 
there were 415 hate crimes re¬ 
ported to Community United 
Against Violence in 1996, with 96 
percent of the incidents involving 
a weapon. In 1998, there were 434 
hate crimes reported to the 
agency, which received $15,000 
through the Gateway Initiative. 

Other organizations that re¬ 
ceived strategic partnership grants 
include the LGBT Community 
Center Project, which received 
$20,000; Gay and Lesbian Histor¬ 
ical Society, $15,000; Harvey Milk 
Institute, $20,000; Lavender Youth 
Recreation and Information Cen¬ 
ter, $10,000; Pacific Center for 
Human Growth, $25,000; Rain¬ 
bow Community Center of Con¬ 
tra Costa County, $14,000; Sexual 
Minority Alliance of Alameda 
County, $15,000; and Spectrum 
Center in Marin County, $15,000. 

Many other groups received 
grants for LGBT program devel¬ 
opment. They are: Afro Solo, 
$10,000; Asian Women’s Shelter, 
$11,000; Black Gay Letters and 
Arts Movement, $5,000; Catholic

Help lift tumblers 
of Cheer sky-high 



by Mike Satinas 


111 any people say they would 

• . bend over backwards for 
* the community. One 
group is notable for proving it. 
The bouncy pouncy cheerleading 
tumblers known as Cheer San 
Francisco will soon enter their 
20th year of performing in the 
Bay Area, although not always 
under that name. 

Formerly called the Raw Rahs, 
the group is notable for perform¬ 
ing dazzling aerial acrobatics at 
parades and celebrations, and is 
best known for assembling a 
dizzying human pyramid that al¬ 
ways inspires spectators to roar 
their approval. And although such 
daring precision may look impos¬ 
sible, members of Cheer SF say it’s 
within the grasp of most people 
with a positive attitude. They’re so 
sure, they’ll offer two workshops 
in July to community members 
who’d like to learn how. 

Team Captain Steve Burke told 
the Bay Area Reporter that group 
members will lead workshops in 
July to teach the basic skills of 
cheerleading, and them will audi¬ 
tion prospective members in the 
middle of the month. “People 
shouldn’t get too concerned about 
that word ‘audition,’ though,” he 
said. “We’ll teach a short routine 
and then they’ll come back and 
show us what they’ve learned.” 

He also said that the team is 
looking for people with all levels 
of tumbling ability, as long as they 
all have a high level of dedication. 
“It’s not only skill and talent,” he 
said. “It’s more important to have 
a good attitude, to be committed. 
We ask new members for a year’s 
commitment if possible, practic¬ 
ing one day a week, and of course 
on performance days.” 

The precision that comes with 
weekly practice is easily apparent 
at Cheer’s many appearances each 
year, the next of which will be 
tonight (Thursday, June 3) at the 
spring championship game of the 
gay men’s basketball league. 

On Saturday, Cheer will join 
the SF Lesbian and Gay Freedom 
Band (and other performing arts 


groups) at Yerba Buena Gardens, 
located at 701 Mission Street, to 
salute the Jon Sims Center for the 
Performing Arts. The next day 
they’ll show their feats in Santa 
Cruz, performing for the eighth 
consecutive year at the Santa Cruz 
Pride Parade and Festival. 

Next weekend, Cheer will ap¬ 
pear in the Sacramento Pride Fes¬ 
tival on Saturday, June 12. 

As always, Cheer will also flip 
and tumble down Market Street 
in San Francisco’s pride march 
later this month, and will need 
volunteers to help make it possi¬ 
ble. Volunteers - perhaps future 
members - will be called upon 
both to assist during the parade 
and to staff the fundraising booth 
during the accompanying cele¬ 
bration. 

Fundraisers are important, ac¬ 
cording to Burke, because the 
team travels so much. Last year the 
group went to Amsterdam, and 
next year members will head to 
Hawaii. In some cases, members 
have come to the aid of other team 
members. “The team comes to¬ 
gether to help anyone who’s hav¬ 
ing financial problems,” he said. 
“We depend on each other on the 
ground, so we want to make sure 
everyone gets on the plane.” 

Ironically, that mirrors the sit¬ 
uation in the human pyramid, 
where the “flyers” (those on the 
top) are supported by the “bases.” 


“We try not to call them ‘tops’ 
and ‘bottoms,’” Burke said, “but 
we do sometimes. We have a lot of 
fun.” 

He also says it’s great for phys¬ 
ical conditioning. “Over time we 
see people who come in with no 
skills, who have no background in 
cheerleading, and watch them de¬ 
velop. In six months to a year they 
can be one of our top performers.” 

But although Cheer is a group 
where it’s literally possible to work 
your way from the bottom of the 
heap to the top, it’s more likely for 
some than others. 

“I’ll never be a flyer,” Burke 
said. “I weigh 185 pounds. That’s 
always a consideration. 

“I’m one of those guys who 
helps others rise to their heights.” ▼ 


Cheer workshops will be held 
from noon to 3 p.m. Sunday, 
July 11 and Saturday, July 17 
at Justin Herman Plaza Park, 
located at Embarcadero and 
Market, at Head Over Heels 
Gym, located at 1250 45th 
Street in Emeryville, from 8 to 
10 p.m. Tuesday, July 13. 
Auditions will be Sunday, July 
18 at the Jon Sims Center, 
located at 1519 Mission Street 
in San Francisco, from 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. For further

SFAF hears critics , AIDS info at meeting 


by Cynthia Laird 


N | o one was arrested or es- 
| corted out of the confer- 
I ence room at the San Fran¬ 
cisco AIDS Foundation’s (SFAF) 
board meeting last Thursday, 
May 27, and after a couple of ac¬ 
tivists voiced their displeasure at 
Executive Director Pat Christen, 
the meeting settled down and 
board members and guests heard 
thorough presentations by SFAF 
staff on a variety of topics associ¬ 
ated with the epidemic. 

Approximately a dozen of 
SFAF’s 19 board members attend¬ 
ed. Only four speakers showed up 
of the six who signed up for four 
minutes to address the board. 
Photographs and recording de¬ 
vices were not allowed at the 
meeting. 

First up was Bay Area Reporter 
news editor Mike Salinas, who 
suggested board members “break 
the silence,” quoting from Chris- 
ten’s op-ed piece in the San Fran¬ 
cisco Chronicle , if they were pri¬ 


vately unhappy with the practice 
of awarding double-digit raises to 
SFAF executives. 

AIDS activist Michael Petrelis 
was next; he had wanted to offer 
Christen a handful of bread 
crumbs, but alert security people 
prevented that from happening. 
As a person with AIDS in San 
Francisco, Petrelis said, “All I get 
are crumbs.” He said plans are in 
the works for a picnic in front of 
Christen’s East Bay home some 
Sunday afternoon. “We hope 


you’ll talk to us and end the si¬ 
lence,” he said. 

Next, AIDS dissident David 
Pasquarelli criticized Christen’s 
guest opinion piece, in which she 
discussed the need for gay men to 
communicate with respect to sex¬ 
ual encounters and the conflicts 
that arise over disclosing one’s 
HIV status. 

“You are reviled in the gay 
community,” Pasquarelli said. 
“You have no right to speak about

Corrections 

In “Women’s Motorcycle Contingent on a roll,” in the May 27 
Bay Area Reporter, the phone number for volunteers to call was in¬ 
correct; the number is (415) 789-8254. 

In last week’s “Wheels of Fortune, Part 6 Lost and foundation” 
the $1 million reported to be spent by the San Francisco AIDS Foun¬ 
dation on lobbying in 1997 is incorrect; that amount represents the 
maximum SFAF could spend on lobbying. The actual amount spent 
was $205,817, as reported in the 1997-98 IRS 990 form. Addition¬ 
ally, former SFAF staffer Amber Fields was not a social worker, she 
worked as a receptionist Finally, Rene Durazzo, who is heterosexu¬ 
al, is SFAF’s director of programs. A gay man, Joe Headlee, actually 
runs SFAF’s Gay Life program. We regret the errors.

JCj n auction of fine Mexican 
art takes place tonight 
?/ % (Thursday, June 3) at the 
Bucheon Gallery, to benefit the 
Frente Comun Contra el SIDA (the 
Common Front Against AIDS) of 
Oaxaca, Mexico. The art preview 
takes place today from 10 a.m. 
until 4 p.m. at the gallery, located 
at 540 Hayes Street, at Gough, and 
people are welcome to stop by and 
take a look. 

Entitled “The Magic of Oaxa¬ 
ca,” the auction will feature a large 
selection of outstanding contem¬ 
porary Oaxacan art, donated by 
nearly 40 artists. Proceeds from 
the event will help with AIDS ed¬ 
ucation and prevention programs 
in the community that is located 
about 250 miles south of Mexico 
City. 

“Oaxacan art has been said to 
contain ‘the essence of Mexico,’” 
said Russell Ellison, art coordina¬ 
tor for the event. “Artists such as 
Rufino Tamayo, Francisco Toledo, 
and Ruben Leyva have created a 
new artistic language, using their 
unique heritage to communicate 
their special vision. In much of 
this art is balanced the intellectu¬ 
al, the mythological, and the spir¬ 
itual, which is one of the reasons 
Oaxacan art is so attractive to col¬ 
lectors today.” 

For years, the broad plateau of 
the Oaxaca Valley has been pro¬ 
ducing some of the most interest¬ 
ing and arresting art in Mexico. 
Today, Oaxacan art is increasingly 
commanding attention by serious 
collectors and Oaxacan artists are 
admired around the world. 

Admission to the event is $20 
per person; that includes a raffle 
ticket for the prize of a 10-day va¬

According to Bill Wolf, general

The Frente s current activities are

Wolf added that the organiza¬

Times and tides 


T he frigid weather that plagued us in 
May shows no sign of relenting, lead¬ 
ing to some crankiness. Just as we 
started to get persnickety about it ourselves, 
we saw a homeless man who frequently 
spends his days wandering Market Street 
with his belongings in two suitcases. It 
made us remember Rudyard Kipling’s line, 
“I cried because I had no shoes and then I 
met a man who had no feet.” Meaning: as 
cold as we may get, it could only be worse 
without a warm place to sleep, to relax, even 
to go to the bathroom. 

We ache for the homeless, a population 
that has seen no visible decrease during this 
mayoral administration, even though the 
economy is reportedly improving national¬ 
ly, statewide, and citywide. It would seem 
that the old saying about a rising tide lifting 
all boats is wrong. Sometimes rising tides 
just drown people. 

Property owners seem delighted about 
the rising real estate market in Northern Cal¬ 
ifornia, but anyone who thinks their housing 
investment will make them rich should think 
again. Everybody who tries to cash in their 
home to get a fat return will just have to 
spend it all on another house that someone 
else is making a fat return on, or move else¬ 
where. That, of course, would put them in 
the same league as the homeless, a group that 
Mayor Brown has already suggested needs to 
relocate to more affordable areas. 

Last week at the San Francisco AIDS 
Foundation board meeting, staffers esti¬ 
mated 2,000 additional beds are needed to 
meet housing needs for people living with 
HIV/AIDS. The sooner that need is met, the 
better. Too many people who should be ad¬ 
dressing it creatively - from city lawmakers 
to nonprofit groups - just wring their hands 
and complain that something must be done. 


That’s not good enough. They have those 
jobs, after all, because they are per¬ 
ceived to be creative enough to fig¬ 
ure out some solutions. Solve 
something. — 

Speaking of the SFAF board 
meeting, we were surprised to see — 
so few attendees last Thursday. That 
board has ladled out annual raises to the 
executive director averaging more 
than 16 percent each year for 
nine years, four times what the 
average American receives, but 
the largesse has gone all but 
unchallenged by this community, which 
largely funds those increases. We’re not sure 



if everyone else in the gay Mecca was too 
busy Thursday - tabulating their real estate 
increases, or huddling over their iMacs 
cruising people on the Internet that 
they wouldn’t be caught dead talking 
to in person - but the community 
was, in Grace Slick’s great phrase, con¬ 
spicuous by its absence. 

We hope to see a better turnout 
for the meeting on bathhouses 
tonight (Thursday, June 3) at 
5:30 at Mission High School, 

_ 3750 18th Street. No matter 

what your opinion is, this is an 
issue that warrants community response. 
See you there. T

Sperm Bank of California 


T he Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) is trying to prevent gay men 
from having children. 

At its Human Issue Seminar on April 8, 
1999, the FDA announced proposed regu¬ 
lations that would make it illegal for gay 
men to be sperm donors, block medical as¬ 
sistance for infertility, and almost eliminate 
the possibility of having biological children. 
Outlining the regulations was the FDA’s 
chief architect of the proposal, Ruth 
Solomon, M.D., director of the Human Tis¬ 
sue Program, Office of Blood and Research 
and Review, Center for Biologies Evaluation 
and Research (CBER) of the FDA. 

The regulations, due to be finalized by 
the end of 1999, will do two things. First, 
gay men would be banned from being 
anonymous sperm donors. Under these reg¬ 
ulations heterosexual men may have multi¬ 
ple sexual partners and be acceptable. How¬ 
ever, gay men in a long-term mutually 
monogamous relationship would not. Cur¬ 
rent fertility industry standards require 
anonymous sperm donations to be frozen 
and quarantined for six months, then 
donors are retested for HIV before their 
sperm is released for inseminations. The 
HIV window period - the time after infec¬ 
tion until an HIV antibody test is positive - 
is one to three months. In 14 years of using 
the HIV antibody test, the Centers for Dis¬ 
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) could 
only point to one case of a man who ap¬ 


peared healthy and went beyond this win¬ 
dow period. He did not turn positive for 
two years. He was heterosexual and special¬ 
ized tests conclusively showed he was in¬ 
fected by his wife who was infected by an 
extra-marital relationship. (Morbidity and 
Mortality Weekly Report 1996; 45:181-185). 
In light of the effective screening procedures 
already in place and because there is no sci¬ 
entific or medical basis for excluding gay 
donors, such as ban would be discrimina¬ 
tion. 

Secondly, it would force directed 
donors, men who wish to father 
children with a woman they already 
know, to freeze their sperm, quar¬ 
antine it for six months and be 
retested for HIV before their 
sperm is used for insemination. 

Given the fact that only one 
out of six men (16 per¬ 
cent) have sperm that 
survives the freezing 
process well enough to 
meet the World Health Organization’s min¬ 
imum standard of fertility, this second rule 
will effectively prevent 84 percent of gay 
men from the possibility of having children. 
The only way that some of these 84 percent 
who have minimal survival after freezing 
may use their sperm is by expensive and in¬ 
vasive high tech fertility methods. The price 
for these methods range up to $12,000 per 
attempt with very low success rates. Health 
insurance rarely covers this and most will 
not have the money for such expensive and 
otherwise unnecessary procedures. 

The FDA denies they are discriminating 
on the basis of sexual orientation. They do 
acknowledge that they exclude “men who 
have had sex with other men [MSM] in the 
last five years”. A standard response is, 
“Now, that does not discriminate against 
gay men per se, but I can see how someone 
might interpret it that way.” 

On May 7,1996 Tom Spira, M.D., assis¬ 
tant chief for medical science for the CDC, 
said “I would not, categorically, want to ex¬ 
clude them [gay men] since we have appro¬ 
priate testing. If you do so, I believe, you 
gain a false sense of security.” Charles Sell¬ 
able, chief of the AIDS Diagnostic Labora¬ 


tory at the CDC, said, “If one i^freezing the 
sperm and retesting the donor after six 
months the only reason to apply that crite¬ 
rion [MSM] to semen donors is homopho¬ 
bia.” Both men stressed that they were 
speaking for themselves and not the CDC, 
as the CDC has a policy advising against gay 
donors (MSM). Letters from the CDC 
admit they have no scientific evidence to 
support their policy but are simply follow¬ 
ing the “advice of a consultant panel.” 

The FDA does not have to come up with 
new sperm banking regulations at all. A 
California Health Department subcommit¬ 
tee has completed work on proposed 
, regulations, not yet enacted, 
which follows scientific evidence, 
\ protects public health, and does 
not discriminate. California has 
already enacted a Health 
and Safety Code (Divi¬ 
sion 2 - Chapter 4.2 Sec¬ 
tion 1644.5), which 
specifically allows the use 
of fresh or frozen sperm for directed dona¬ 
tion as long as the donor has been appro¬ 
priately screened and the woman has been 
appropriately counseled about her risks. 
These two documents are a package that in¬ 
sures both our health and our rights. Dr. 
Solomon Ignored the ’’California Plan” in 
devising the FDA’s regulations. 

The FDA’s regulations would override 
California laws and would be a program of 
mass sterilization by regulation. They will 
deprive lesbians of the choice of having 
children with gay men. Banning gay men 
from being donors perpetuates the myth 
that AIDS is a gay disease. To protest these 
proposed regulations and to support the 
“California Plan,” please call toll-free 1-877-

We reserve the right to serve refuge... 

As the service provider for the EVRC temporary 
shelter, the Ark of Refuge would like to thank the Bay 
Area Reporter for its fair and thorough coverage of 
this special project. In addition, our thanks to Wayne 
Friday and Supervisor Leno for their acknowledg¬ 
ments of some of the many generous, caring com¬ 
munity members who made this first-of-its-kind in 
San Francisco program targeting homeless LGBTQQ 
young adults a far greater success than we could have 
imagined when we accepted the charge to administer 
the shelter. 

We also would like to take this opportunity to ad¬ 
dress Andrew Bertagnolli’s diatribe against Supervi¬ 
sor Katz and the shelter in the May 20 B.A.R. We find 
it very interesting that Mr. Bertagnolli never raised 
any of his concerns during the run of the shelter itself. 
In fact, throughout the entire shelter project neither 
the Ark nor LYRIC received a single complaint from 
the neighborhood, while Supervisor Katz’s office and 
the specially designated emergency pager for the SF 
Street Patrol registered a total of four calls regarding 
disturbances, only one of which could be directly 
linked to shelter clients. Similarly, police logs for that 
period of time showed an actual decline in the num¬ 
ber of incident reports for the 10-week shelter run 
(Mr. Bertagnolli wrongly states that problems were 
associated with the shelter for “the past four months). 
Clearly, the provision of a safe, secure, stabilizing 
space was beneficial to the immediate neighborhood 
as well as to the clients themselves. 

Mr. Bertagnolli also accuses Katz of narrow mind¬ 
edness in not addressing the complexity of issues 
which young homeless adults face. Howev¬ 
er, the Ark and outreach workers from 
other organizations - working closely 
with Katz’s office - succeeded in provid¬ 
ing counseling and referral services to 
clients which resulted in 33 documented 
clients achieving multiple successes 
such as securing new jobs, entering new 
housing opportunities, and accessing 
other detox treatment and/or substan¬ 
tial primary medical services In addition, 158 seven- 
and 14-day contracts were formed with clients, all of 
which required that the clients achieve a practical self¬ 
enhancement goal such as getting an HIV test, sign¬ 
ing up for GED, or contacting a vocational counselor. 
Mr. Bertagnolli also claims that “now kids from all 
over the U.S. have been appearing at EVRC.” Yet de¬ 
mographic studies of shelter clients showed that these 
young adults either were in San Francisco already or 
en route to the city seeking escape from destructive 
life circumstances when the shelter opened. The shel¬ 
ter housed 157 clients in total, but neither neighbors, 
merchants, nor the police noticed an increase in loi¬ 
tering and/or panhandling in the Castro as a result. 
Similarly, there has been no evidence since the shelter 
closed to back up Mr. Bertagnolli’s claim that “the 
homeless problem in the Castro is about to go from 
bad to worse.” The problem certainly still exists city¬ 
wide, but this powerful model of compassionate and 
effective intervention has proven emphatically to be 
both appropriate and necessary for such a highly 
challenged population. Accordingly, the Ark thanks 
Supervisor Katz for her leadership around the EVRC 
shelter, and we look forward to working with the 
Board of Supervisors and the mayor to secure long¬ 
term funding for permanent LGBTQQ shelter in the 
city so that all homeless LGBTQQ young adults can 
experience the enduring support of a community that 
truly cares enough to take care of its own just as much 
now as it ever has before.

Change and changelings 

Right about this time last year, the merchants in 
the Castro had signs up saying “Make change, don’t 
give change” (or something to that effect) and it ap¬ 
peared to be working. For the first time in about three 
years, I could actually walk down Castro and be pan- 
handler-free. Friends from out of town enjoyed the 
Castro again. 

I’m in the Castro frequently and couldn’t imagine 
why, within the past few months, the panhandlers are 
out in full force. From becoming a relatively quiet 
street (for Castro, that is) the street has become a war 
zone of sorts. I asked a few people who were begging 
for cigarettes, dope or “whatever” where they came 
from and each one said they “live” on Collingwood. 

Does anyone have any clue as to when this “tem¬ 
porary” shelter is supposed to close? 

Is anyone from this shelter monitoring the where¬ 
abouts of their “clients” or is it just assumed that, 
when they leave in the morning, they’ll walk a block 
away and squat in a doorway for the rest of the day?

[Editor’s note: It’s closed now. You didn’t notice?] 


Not in my three or four block radius! 

Cynthia Laird’s complete lack of objectivity in her 
May 27 article concerning the homeless shelter at the 
Eureka Valley Recreation Center is astonishing. 
Nowhere in her story does she mention the signifi¬ 
cant problems attributed to the shelter, problems elo¬ 
quently summarized by Andrew Bertagnolli’s May 20 
letter to the B.A.R. Nor does she mention the increase 
in vagrancy along 18th Street that followed the open¬ 
ing of the EVRC to the homeless. Dr. Bertagnolli’s let¬ 
ter makes it clear that the few individuals who may 
have benefited from being housed at EVRC did so at 
a great cost to the residents along Collingwood Street. 

Although she forced the neighborhood to accept 
housing homeless at the EVRC despite strenuous ob¬ 
jections, Supervisor Katz is to be commended for 
honoring her commitment to close it May 16. Those 
who believe the shelter should be reopened (they are 
a vocal minority) should be willing to hold a special 
election so registered voters who reside within a three 
or four block radius of the EVRC can decide if this is 
an appropriate use of the facility or if they want on¬ 
going housing for vagrants in the community.

More than just a shelter 

As one of the initial proponents for the temporary 
queer youth shelter at the Eureka Valley Recreation 
Center (EVRC), I can emphatically and proudly say I 
was overwhelmed with the success of this first-ever 
shelter program focusing on helping and supporting 
homeless queer youth. Though no program 
is perfect, this shelter exceeded expecta- 
I tions. 

To respond to Mr. Bertagnolli’s letter 
in the B.A.R. accusing me of not re¬ 
sponding to individuals concerned about 
the shelter, my office, along with Super¬ 
visor Leno, shelter staff, staff from the 
Ark of Refuge such as Eric Politzer, staff 
from the SF Patrol Special Police such 
as Jane Warner, Castro merchants such as Morgan 
Gorrono, staff at Metropolitan Community Church 
(MCC) such as Reverend Penny Nixon, staff at LYRIC 
such as Brian Cheu, staff at EVRC such as Nancy Dito, 
and a myriad of community members were all inte¬ 
gral and consistent participants in the shelter. Mr. 
Bertagnolli never attempted to contact anyone asso¬ 
ciated with the shelter after his one appearance at the 
February 4 MUMC meeting. 

We not only had another community meeting 
later in February to address community concerns 
about the shelter, but our office and the SF Patrol Spe¬ 
cial Police contacted those residents and merchants 
who had strong concerns about the shelter through¬ 
out the months it was open to hear their concerns as 
the shelter progressed. We had multiple meetings 
scheduled with different community groups and or¬ 
ganizations while the shelter was open, all of which 
were canceled because of the little negative impact the 
shelter had on the Castro and surrounding area. 

In addition, Mr. Bertagnolli accuses Supervisor 
Leno and me of not mentioning the problems associ¬ 
ated with the shelter, problems that were not men¬ 
tioned because our offices and the SF Patrol Special 
Police received only one complaint during the dura¬ 
tion of the shelter that could be linked to its clients. 
One complaint, rapidly dealt with, is a small price to 
pay for providing shelter for over 150 youth and help¬ 
ing over 30 youth achieve multiple successes. 

Also, the shelter was not only a place for youth to 
sleep. Through the outreach provided every week at 
the shelter, from groups such as Guerrero House, 
Central City/Hospitality House, Dimensions Clinic 
and Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic to name a few, many 
young adults found permanent or transitional hous¬ 
ing, found jobs, accessed health services and detox 
programs, accessed educational programs and recon¬ 
nected with their families. In addition, MCC gener¬ 
ously provided space to serve both breakfast and din¬ 
ner. At every meal, two volunteers from the commu¬ 
nity served food and sat and talked to the youth. 

Those young adults who have not yet found hous¬ 
ing or employment have been encouraged to contin¬ 
ue their relationships with LYRIC and EVRC staff, to 
access day programs at LYRIC and EVRC, and to at¬ 
tend the Simply Supper program at MCC. In addi¬ 
tion, the plans for the permanent young adult shelter 
are being finalized this summer. 

Though Mr. Bertagnolli paints a picture of anar¬ 
chy on the steps of EVRC, there is absolutely no evi¬ 
dence to support his claims that youth are loitering 
and being belligerent in front of EVRC all day. 

I am thrilled that this venture was such an un¬ 
qualified success. The shelter became a model of com¬ 
munity and city cooperation and I am proud to have 
been a part of its opening and to have worked with 
such extraordinary community leaders and volun¬ 
teers. I am deeply committed to continuing to work 
with community members to support the homeless 
youth in our community.

Dissing the dissidents 

I do not have links to the health professions, phar¬ 
maceutical interests, AIDS organizations or other 
similar motives for writing, but I have always been 
fascinated by the irrational. How do the proponents 
of “AIDS-as-a-lifestyle-disorder” dismiss the ravages 
of HIV in populations whose only risks were trans¬ 
fusions, infected partners, needle pricks, or breast 
feeding? What were the lifestyle excesses of the faith¬ 
ful wives, the nuns, the hemophiliacs, and the little 
kids who succumbed to AIDS? What were the hedo¬ 
nistic practices of Ryan White, or the thousands of 
East Europeans children infected by inoculations 
from re-used needles? 

What twisted reasoning causes anyone to cite the 
decline in U.S. AIDS cases as proof that there is “no 
epidemic,” or that HIV does not cause AIDS? 

And why do so, knowing that this virus - in the 
countries where cases are declining - has been fought 
with the most comprehensive prevention efforts ever 
undertaken? And what can prompt people who deny 
the validity of rigorous investigation, in hundreds of 
independent studies, to accept at face value the “offi¬ 
cial” statistics of poor nations in which medical facil¬ 
ities and reliable case reporting are all but non-exis¬ 
tent? (And how, for that matter, has the disease ap¬ 
peared at all in simple rural villages with conservative 
social mores, that were light years away from the sup¬ 
posedly debauched ways of the industrialized world?) 

Social historians have alluded to numerous peri¬ 
ods of license and promiscuity in this history of na¬ 
tions, and report the prevalence of sexually transmit¬ 
ted diseases, but until the emergence of human im- 
muno deficiency virus - perhaps from the forests of 
central Africa - there is no record of what we know as 
AIDS. 

In the simplest terms, virtually everyone infected 
with HIV, barring successful intervention, is subject 
to the rare and defining viral, fungal and bacterial ill¬ 
nesses associated with it, and virtually no one free of 
the virus will experience the same ranges of exotic ill¬ 
nesses. Even with due respect for those who disagree, 
I can only suggest that the denial of HIV in AIDS is a 
more baffling sickness than AIDS itself.

Dissidents dis back 

Finding contradiction where there is only advoca¬ 
cy, befuddled by p.c. thinking, unable to broach the 
subject of science, the membership of ACT UP/Gold- 
en Gate remind me of a cage full of squawking parrots 
[“An ad monition,” Mailstrom, May 20.J “HIV Repro¬ 
duction,” “the HIV virus,” mindlessly parroting phar¬ 
maceutical brochures and refusing to read the label’s 
side effects. ACT UP/Golden Gate is unable to discuss 
the subject at hand relying instead on a litany of false¬ 
hoods. Last March in the Journal of American Medical 
Association, none other than Paul Volberding stated 
that any long term effects of protease regimes are not 
advisable and cautioned against them. ACT UP/Gold¬ 
en Gate doesn’t even bother to read their own au¬ 
thorities. There is no discussion about those on the 
drug regimes suffering from strokes at the age of 
twenty-something, crix belly, and other metabolic 
horrors. I read on the front page of the BA.R. “It’s of¬ 
ficial: Stress gives HIVers AIDS,” something ACT 
UP/SF has been saying for years and is in complete 
accordance with our position concerning medical 
marijuana. Bombarded with misinformation, handed 
a death sentence, subjected to psychological brain¬ 
washing, stigmatized to the point of criminality, any¬ 
one designated HIV-positive is well deserving of a 
toke of some high grade bud. In the meantime there 
is no argument: HIV does not cause AIDS. We trust 
the public enough to believe that once informed they 
can come to their own conclusions. 

As to the accusation of being “right-wing” we of 
ACT UP/SF have to laugh. We are communists, anar¬ 
chists, gay liberationists, poets, painters, artists, ani¬ 
mal rights activists, tree-huggers, we even count a sur¬ 
realist in our group, but we are not, nor will we ever 
be, right wing, an accusation that attests to the intel¬ 
lectual poverty of our opponents. 

Make no mistake about it, ACT UP/SF’s position 
with regards to ending AIDS is simple, direct and to 
the point. The lessons of AIDS are sociological not 
medical. In terms of services there is enough for 
everyone. If we move to slash the military budget we 
can have universal health care for all. Nothing less can 
end the misery and marginalization that is the condi¬ 
tion known as AIDS. Our message continues to make 
right wingers, drug treatment advocates, and AIDS 
Industry executives turn green with horror. 

Finally, with regards to the issue of accountability, 
whatever finances have been used to launch our ad 
campaign, you can be sure it wasn’t with Ryan White 
Care Act funds. Nor will any of us be buying a house 
in the Oakland Hills from money meant for the HIV¬ 
positive. When it comes to the issues, we insist, our 
enemies continue to be our best argument.

And now, a word from a GHB expert 

The lead story of the May 27 issue of the B.A.R. 
concerning the recent death of Skylar Ringland due to 
mixing alcohol with GHB includes inaccurate infor¬ 
mation, albeit spoken by friends of Ms. Ringland, 
about what one should and should not do when con¬ 
suming GHB. I have served as a consultant for sever¬ 
al studies on GHB, and am currently conducting a 
study of the gay-male circuit parties (including ma¬ 
terial on GHB usage), and it concerns me that the gay 
press should make more of an effort to report accu¬ 
rate information concerning GHB. For instance, the 
idea that you cannot allow someone to fall asleep on 
GHB is simply not correct. I don’t want to recount all 
of the hundreds of sources of empirical data that I 
have gathered about GHB here, but I do want to en¬ 
courage you, especially if the B.A.R. is interested in 
reducing the number of GHB/alcohol related deaths, 
to do a story where accurate, judicious, and thorough 
reporting occurs about GHB. Whether one likes it or 
not, GHB is here to stay, and we must come up with 
strategies to reduce the potential harmful effects of its 
misuse within the rave, club, and circuit scenes.

GH-be careful 

Ingesting large amounts of water with GHB does 
not necessarily make it safe. Overdose is still possible. 
The single most important fact about GHB is its 
sharp dose/response curve - so people used to feel¬ 
ing a buzz after one beer can drink two more and feel 
about 50 percent more intoxicated. They can drink 
even two more and still be standing. If you rapidly in¬ 
gest two grams of GHB and feel buzzed and then 
think you can double or quadruple that as you would 
beer, your friends will find you unconscious no mat¬ 
ter how much water you drank. 

The advice not to let someone suffering acute 
GHB intoxication sleep is also not very useful. They’ll 
pass out even if you yell at them, throw water in their 
face, or give them smelling salts. It’s better to remain 
calm, place them on their stomach or side so the vic¬ 
tim won’t choke on his or her own vomit, and get 
medical.attention. 

GHB is not a killer drug. More people have died 
from alcohol and probably aspirin this year than from 
GHB alone. Because GHB does not affect respiration 
as adversely as alcohol or opiates, people who over¬ 
dose on GHB by using it irresponsibly often regain 
consciousness safely and without a hangover. This is 
much like the effect of large doses of Kava in Polyne¬ 
sian Kava ceremonies where very large doses cause a 
very deep, dreamless sleep that ends without next day 
effects. 


Joe Tucker 
San Francisco 

[We agree that education is better than abolition. We 
got our information from poison control, the police, the 
medical examiner, and GHB users, and suggested lying 
victims on their sides, both in the story about Ringland 
and in our April 21 story, “SFPD’s GHB warning: turn 
victims on their sides.” Our objective, as Dr. Carring¬ 
ton put it, is to come up with strategies to reduce the po¬ 
tential harmful effects of its misuse.] 

And now, a word from a pot expert... 

Beneath the hype and gaudy of now-trendy mari¬ 
juana lies a simple truth. This stuff should have never 
been made illegal. Most of us know that. A large per¬ 
cent of our elected officials have some clue as to their 
constituents’ change of perception. 

Local laws banning medical use and possession fall 
like bricks from the Berlin Wall. The federal govern¬ 
ment looks on, guarding the “old way” like cement 
lions at the front door. Where do we go from here? 

We have to recognize change does not come easy. 
It is a personal affront to the way things have “always” 
been. Fear of the unknown is understandable - it’s 
dark out there in the woods, especially without a road 
map! But we do have each other, and like it or not 
that’s how we’re suppose to operate on this planet. 
That’s why its so small and we’re so many. Everything 
goes haywire when we live contrary to our nature. 
Taken a good look around lately? 

Cannabis. Marijuana. Hemp. Pot. Call it what you 
will, there are valid reasons for this plant’s existence. 
We can’t simply eradicate it like we do every other 
being which gets in the way of our bright ideas. We’ve 
got to change our M.O.! Humans can’t continue to be 
arrogant, self serving creatures. We are members of a 
bio-society. Hasn’t Public TV taught us anything? 

This is our moment of epiphany. We have the op¬ 
portunity to transcend to our next-highest level of ex¬ 
perience by simply opening our minds. 

It’ll be okay. Honest. And remember - cannabis is 
not evil. Hypocrisy is.

GOP hopefuls to take on 
George “Junior” Bush 


by Wayne Friday 


l exas Governor George W. 
Bush, heretofore very quiet 
on issues while stockpiling 
millions of dollars in campaign 
funds for a presidential run, is 
about to finally come out of the 
Texas (yellow) Rose Garden. He 
has been able to hide out in 
Austin and wriggle out of taking 
a stand on such issues as Kosovo, 
abortion, gay rights, the GOP-fa- 
vored national flat tax, and 
guns, using the excuse 
that he has been busy 
with the “business of 
running the Lone Star 
State .” That will come to 
a screeching halt 
when the Texas Legis¬ 
lature adjourns this 
month, and he 
will now be 
forced to join 
the fray 
whether he likes the idea or not. 

And what kind of “welcome to 
the club” will he likely get from his 
fellow candidates? Well, former Vice 
President Dan Quayle says about 
him that he thinks “there is more 
hype than hope”; perennial Repub¬ 
lican presidential aspirant Patrick 
Buchanan says he can hardly wait 
to see “if Junior can take a punch”; 
Elizabeth Dole says that he “can¬ 
not hide behind his father’s famous 
name” much longer; Steve Forbes, 
the multimillionaire publisher and 
GOP hopeful in 1996, says he is 
ready to spend up to $10 million of 
his personal fortune in television 
ads alone to get out his message and 
to “force” out Bush’s message; far 
right candidate Gary Bauer, the 
darling of the anti-abortion Repub¬ 
licans, is itching to “see what he is 
all about”; and even Arizona Sena¬ 
tor John McCain is jabbing at him 
for his silence on the war in Yu¬ 
goslavia. Oh, and for those people 
who care about what former Ten¬ 
nessee Governor Lamar Alexan¬ 
der has to say, he referred to Bush 
as a “strong, but untested” candi¬ 
date. (Ouch! Fighting words!)" 

“Untested” is only part of the 
problem. “Inconsistent” is the 
other. Take guns: Bush will tell 
those who wish to hear it that he 
is for instant checks at gun shows, 
but he let the Texas Legislature, 
which he controls, allow the issue 
to die; he also recently - quietly - 
signed into a law allowing private 
citizens to carry concealed hand¬ 
guns. Bush also says he supports 
legislation making it tough on 
those who commit hate crimes, 
but doesn’t think gays and lesbians 
should be covered by such a law. 

Bush also tries to please both 
sides on the hot-button issue of 
abortion: last month he told con¬ 
servative supporters that while he 
favors a constitutional amend¬ 
ment to make it illegal, his fellow 
Americans’ “hearts are not right” 
on the issue, and too many voters 
oppose such an amendment so 
there is “no sense” in pushing for 
it. On affirmative action the Texas 
governor also conveniently comes 
down on both sides, telling re¬ 
porters that “I’m for affirmative 
access; I think the state ought to 
do everything in its power to pro¬ 
vide equal opportunity for all.” He 
quickly added, however, that “I 
think all quotas put one group of 
people against another.” 

On the international front, 
Bush criticized President Bill Clin¬ 
ton for taking a ground invasion of 


Kosovo off the table (although the 
president is seemingly about to 
change his mind on this), but 
dodged the question of whether he 
would deploy ground troops if he 
were in charge, saying, “That’s de¬ 
pendent upon what my military 
advisors would tell me.” 

Bush has become so adept at 
double-speaking on most issues 
that his Republican opponents 
have publicly taken to referring to 
his positions as “Bushspeak.” And 
make no mistake: Buchanan, 
Dole, Bauer, McCain, et 
el., are all awaiting 
their chance to take on 
the Teflon Texan. 
When he hits the po¬ 
litical campaign trail 
later this month in 
places like New Hamp¬ 
shire, Iowa, and even 
California, he 
can be sure 
that he will be 
tested and 
tried - hard - not by Al Gore and 
the Democrats, but by those with¬ 
in his own party who have been 
waiting for him to emerge and 
prove that he can “take a punch.” 

Indeed, many within the Re¬ 
publican Party, while smiling now 
that George W. leads the probable 
Democratic nominee Gore in all 
polls, fear that the anointed, but 
untested, likely Republican nom¬ 
inee’s political star has possibly 
risen too fast. “Once Junior leaves 
Texas and faces up to the likes of 
Pat Buchanan, John McCain, and 
Steve Forbes, it’s a new ballgame 
and this can eventually only ben¬ 
efit Al Gore,” worries one Califor¬ 
nia House member already on the 
Bush bandwagon. 

Politics and people 

Mayor Willie Brown will offi¬ 
cially kick-off his re-election cam¬ 
paign at Yerba Buena Center on 
Saturday, June 12 at noon. The 
mayor’s friends believe the event 
will bring out hundreds of sup¬ 
porters. (Call 503-1999 for info.) 

Meanwhile, former Assistant 
District Attorney Steven Castle- 
man’s friends tell me he is “very se¬ 
riously” considering a run for Ter¬ 
ence Hallinan’s job; one well- 
known attorney familiar with the 
Hall of Justice scene (and who sup¬ 
ported Hallinan the last time, inci¬ 
dentally) says that “Steve shouldn’t 
be underestimated - he’s got the 
means and the determination to 
really fight it out with Terence.” 

CBS’s famous anchor Dan 
Rather - who asked Hillary Rod¬ 
ham Clinton point-blank during 
an interview last week, “ Why are 
you still with that manT' - will ap¬ 
pear at a book-signing this Satur¬ 
day, June 5, at Book Passage in 
Corte Madera (927-0960 for info.) 
Rather’s book: Deadlines and Date¬ 
lines: Essays Written at the Turn of 
the Century (William Morrow) is 
sure to be a bestseller; he is the 
third network news anchor (NBC’s 
Tom Brokow and ABC’s Peter Jen¬ 
nings were the others) to appear at 
the Corte Madera bookstore in re¬ 
cent months. 

Political observers in Sacra¬ 
mento are still buzzing over the 
way Lieutenant Governor Cruz 
Bustamante was almost entirely 
shut out of meetings and arrange¬ 
ments with Mexico’s President 
Ernesto Zedillo during the Mex¬ 
ican leader’s recent visit; Gover¬ 
nor Gray Davis and his support¬ 
ers are still reportedly seething 
over the way Bustamante publicly 


attacked the governor over the 
Proposition 187 appeal. 

Term limits are once again 
showing their limitations: while 
legislators should be putting their 
noses to the grindstone and doing 
their jobs, they are forced to 
worry about their next campaigns 
and where they will land political¬ 
ly. Instead of allowing officehold¬ 
ers to build up seniority, power, 
and stature, term limits have liter¬ 
ally forced many to compete 
against each other for new seats in 
order to stay in public office; 
many good legislators are being 
“termed out,” like Democratic As¬ 
semblywoman Sheila Kuehl of 
Santa Monica who will now face a 
strong primary race against an¬ 
other incumbent Democrat as- 
semblymember for the state Sen¬ 
ate seat of longtime gay rights 
supporter Tom Hayden (also a 
victim of term limits). 



Christine Kehoe 


Incidentally, a reader from the 
southland e-mailed that I failed to 
mention San Diego Councilmem- 
ber Christine Kehoe in a recent 
column about gay and lesbian can¬ 
didates. Kehoe is already running a 
very strong campaign in the 76th 
Assembly District where the in¬ 
cumbent, Susan Davis, a longtime 
friend of the gay and lesbian com¬ 
munity, is also “termed out” and 
will be a candidate for the House of 
Representatives in the San Diego 
area’s 49th District. (Got all that? 
Whew. And phew and fooey, too!). 

In Nevada, Governor Kenny 
Quinn, the first Republican gov¬ 
ernor there in nearly two decades, 
says he will sign a bill to prohibit 
job discrimination against gays; 
10 states, including California, 
have similar laws and don’t we 
wish the GOP had more gover¬ 
nors like Quinn? 

Show Biz: - a friend sent no¬ 
tice that famed high diver-turned- 
actor Greg Louganis opened re¬ 
cently in a production of Larry 
Kramer’s 1988 farce Just Say No 
at Chicago’s Bailiwick Repertory; 
it’s part of the Pride ’99 fete, and 
the Olympic gold medalist plays a 
president’s gay son, who moves to 
the city to become a ballet dancer. 

Here in the Bay Area we’re 
looking forward to the special 
Beach Blanket Babylon's 21st Sil¬ 
ver Anniversary Celebration show 
at Club Fugazi Monday, June 7. It 
will feature Senator Dianne Fein- 
stein as Snow White, former Sec¬ 
retary of State George Shultz 
(now a San Franciscan) as Super¬ 
man, and appearances by Don 
Johnson, Mayor Willie Brown and 
Danielle Steele (Sharon Stone 
and Robin Williams will also be 
there). You can reportedly still get

Open the baths - it’s 
the 'right’ thing to do 


by Dale Carpenter 

H t’s time to open the baths, San 

Francisco, and treat adults like 
i adults. And let the rest of the 
gay civil rights movement take 
note: we will not win our freedom 
within a framework of big-govern- 
ment politics. 

For most of recorded history, 
government has obsessed on the 
question of what people should 
and should not be allowed to do 
with their genitalia. This old de¬ 
bate is now centered, oddly 
enough, on the famously tolerant 
but government-soaked city of 
San Francisco. A loosely orga¬ 
nized group of activists has been 
trying unsuccessfully for years to 
get the city’s public health au¬ 
thorities to reopen bathhouses - 
private businesses where patrons 
may go to have sex in locked 
rooms. 

San Francisco’s bathhouses 
were closed by city health officials 
in the mid-1980s amid a public 
frenzy over what to do to pre¬ 
vent the spread of AIDS. Iron¬ 
ically, the same officials have 
allowed regulated “sex 
clubs” to remain open 
on the theory that sex in 
these establishments takes 
place in common areas and 
thus can be moni¬ 
tored to ensure that 
patrons are doing it 
safely. 

The problem for gay civil 
rights advocates is that the debate 
over reopening the bathhouses 
has focused almost exclusively on 
what constitutes the best state- 
sponsored HIV-prevention strat¬ 
egy - rather than steering toward 
a more general discussion on the 
proper role of government in reg¬ 
ulating consensual sexual behav¬ 
ior among adults. 

So we have the spectacle of 
progressive pro-bathhouse ac-

Time has passed. The hysteria hasn't. 



tivists arguing to liberal public 
health bureaucrats that allowing 
gay men (and we’re talking almost 
exclusively about men here) to go 
into private rooms, lock the 
doors, exclude monitors, and 
have at it will not increase 
HIV infection rates. This 
argument has the merit 
of being creative. It has 
the political demerit of 
being (a) counterintuitive 
and (b) unprovable. Not sur¬ 
prisingly, govern¬ 
ment coercion is 
winning and free¬ 
dom is losing. 

When the terms of debate are 
monopolized by an argument 
about which government policy 
will or will not provide the great¬ 
est protection from the conse¬ 
quences of human freedom, the 
result will be a public policy that 
curtails that freedom as much as 
is politically feasible. That has 
been the predictable conclusion of 
San Francisco’s health authorities, 
whose chief interest is not the 
maximization of individual liber¬ 
ty but the protection of their own 
regulatory fiefdoms. 

How about arguing, instead, 
that the government and its le¬ 
gion of do-gooders have no busi¬ 
ness telling adults they can’t have 
sex with each other behind closed 
doors? It is, after all, the central 
principle behind the successful ef¬ 
forts in this century to get rid of 
laws forbidding contraceptives, 
birth control clinics, interracial 
marriage, and sodomy. In each 
case, government invaded indi¬ 
vidual freedom to prohibit some 
activity it considered a threat to 
public safety or morals. The justi¬ 
fications for these regulations 
were exposed as shams. The 
means used to protect us were 
judged as inconsistent with indi¬ 
vidual autonomy. 

Like other attempts by govern¬ 
ment to run people’s lives, San 
Francisco’s ban on bathhouses 
curtails liberty in whimsical ways. 
Forget the theories. In practice, 
despite sporadic monitoring, you 
can go to a sex club or a bar or a 
bookstore in the city and have un¬ 
safe sex, but not to a “bathhouse.” 
You can drive 15 minutes across a 
bridge to a bathhouse in a differ¬ 
ent city, but not to one 15 minutes 
across the same city. You can ca¬ 
vort in a bathhouse in places like 
Houston, where sodomy is illegal, 
but not in San Francisco, where it 
is celebrated in street festivals. The 
policy is a mess. 

Moreover, opening the baths 


will not mean it’s open season for 
unsafe sex. A system of disincen¬ 
tives for irresponsible sexual be¬ 
havior exists independent of 
heavy-handed and clumsy gov¬ 
ernment bans on certain kinds of 
sex establishments. There is, to 
begin with, potential civil or even 
criminal liability for any HIV-in¬ 
fected person having unsafe sex. 

There is also the physical, emo¬ 
tional, and financial burden that 
still comes with HIV infection. 
Even with today’s powerful anti- 
HIV drugs, the disease is no pic¬ 
nic. The drugs are expensive, pro¬ 
hibitively so for those with inade¬ 
quate insurance. They almost al¬ 
ways require a complicated daily 
regimen of pill-taking. We have 
no idea whether, or how long, the 
drugs will stave off deadly dis¬ 
eases. We do not know the long¬ 
term effects they will have on the 
human body. And the HIV-posi¬ 
tive person must live with the rad¬ 
ical uncertainty and fear the dis¬ 
ease creates. 

Finally, opening bathhouses - 
or allowing other forms of forbid¬ 
den freedom - does not mean we 
surrender our right to make 
moral judgments about them. We 
can still decry (or extol) the cul¬ 
ture of promiscuity they both re¬ 
flect and promote. It only means 
this function will be taken away 
from government and shifted to 
families, churches, circles of 
friends, and other social institu¬ 
tions. Liberty is not libertinism. 

Allowing people to lead their 
own lives carries risk, as all life 
does. The risk is that they will make 
poor choices and suffer the conse¬ 
quences of those choices. When we 
are children, our parents try to 
shield us from life’s calamities until 
we have a chance to be educated 
about how to avoid them. 

But we grow up. We make de¬ 
cisions and deal with the fallout. 
Our parents can’t parent us forev¬ 
er, and neither should our gov¬ 
ernment. The sooner the gay civil 
rights movement re-orients itself 
to that basic American idea, the 
sooner we will enjoy the full po¬ 
tential freedom brings. ▼

Detestable sins come to the New World 


by David Bianco 


' 1 ' oday in the United States, 
sodomy is primarily de- 

M fined as oral or anal sex be¬ 
tween two men or two women. 
More than a third of the states 
still have sodomy laws on their 
books, and the Supreme Court 
upheld those laws in 1986 in its 
anti-gay decision, Bowers v. 
Hardwick. But the original colo¬ 
nial sodomy laws, passed in the 
1600s, had a much broader view 
of what constituted “sodomy.” 

American sodomy laws de¬ 
rived from the so-called English 
“buggery law,” passed by Parlia¬ 
ment in 1533 in the reign of 
Henry VIII. Until that year, the 
Roman Catholic Church had 
been responsible for judging and 
meting out punishment for 
sodomy, which was considered a 
mortal sin. Under the English 
Reformation, the king declared 
himself head of the church in 
England, cutting off the authori¬ 
ty of the pope. “Buggery” (a pop¬ 
ular word derived from the 
French bougres, meaning “hereti¬ 
cal”) became a criminal offense 
punishable in the courts by 
hanging. Even the clergy were 
subject to criminal prosecution 
for the offense. 

In the so-called “New World,” 
the settlement at Jamestown, Vir¬ 
ginia, was founded in 1607 by the 
London Company as a British 
military and trading post. Dur¬ 
ing its first years, Jamestown had 
few clergy members or women, 
both of which were seen as “civi¬ 
lizing” influences. Although 
British law was implicitly in 
force, in May 1610 the governor 
of Virginia, Sir Thomas Gates, in¬ 
stituted martial law in order to 
keep the young male colonists 
more firmly in line. Virginia’s 
“Articles, Laws, and Orders, Di¬ 
vine, Politique, and Martial” cov¬ 
ered a long list of both secular 
and religious infractions punish¬ 
able by “pain of death” - theft, 
blasphemy, adultery, rape, illegal 
trade with Indians, and “the de¬ 
testable sins of Sodomie.” (It was 
plural because sodomy included 
male-male and male-female anal 
and oral sex, as well as bestiality.) 
The new code sought to instill a 
sense of order on what was seen 
as a wild, unruly group that 
needed “severe discipline ... 
sharp laws ... a hard life and 
much labor.” Martial law was in 
effect for eight years, until more 
women and families began to ar¬ 
rive from England as settlers. 

There were, however, no 
recorded executions for sodomy 
until 1624. The first person to be 
executed was Richard Cornish, a 
ship’s captain accused of sexually 
assaulting his indentured servant, 
William Cowse. The charge, as 
chronicled in the minutes of the 
Virginia court, sounds today like 
a case of sexual harassment —■ 
Cornish wanted to have sex with 
Cowse, who refused and then was 
given extra work. On the basis of 
the testimony of another 
crewmember who overheard 
Cornish proposition Cowse, Cor¬ 
nish was tried and hanged. Two 
men who publicly objected to the 
execution as unjust received pun¬ 
ishments of their own - standing 
on the pillory and having their 
ears cut off. 

As the number of colonial set¬ 
tlements grew in the 1600s, each 
instituted its own local code of 
laws, and each included sodomy 
as a capital offense. The New 
England colonies in particular, 
which were founded by strict reli¬ 


gious separatists, punished 
sodomy harshly because they 
considered it a crime against 
marriage and the family - a 
charge that has echoes in today’s 
debates over homosexuality. But 
the concept of “family” was dif¬ 
ferent 300 years ago; the family 
was, in fact, the major economic 
unit of production of that 
agricultural society. Early 
New Englanders faced 
brutal, unfamiliar weath¬ 
er conditions, crop fail¬ 
ures, starvation, disease, 
high infant mortality, and 
common death in 
childbirth. Procre¬ 
ation was the key to 
the economic sur¬ 
vival of the colonies. 

In this survivalist atmosphere, 
sodomy - both same-sex and op¬ 
posite-sex - and masturbation 
“tended to the frustrating of the 
ordinance of marriage and the 
hindering of the generation of 
mankind,” as John Winthrop de¬ 
clared in the 1646 sodomy trial of 
a man in Guilford, Connecticut. 
“Spilling” or “spending” male 


“seed” in any kind of non-procre- 
ative activity was considered a 
sinful waste, because it put the fu¬ 
ture of the colonies in jeopardy. 

Gay historians have found ap¬ 
proximately 20 recorded cases of 
sodomy charges being brought 
against individual male colonists 
from 1624 to 1740; four result¬ 
ed in the death penalty. Be¬ 
cause lesbian sexual activity 
didn’t involve “seed 
spilling,” it was apparently 
viewed more leniently. 
In one case of “lewd be¬ 
havior ... upon a bed” be¬ 
tween two women in 
Plymouth, both 
women were merely 
given a warning. 
Only the New Haven 
colony authorized death for 
“filthiness” between women, 
judging lesbian sex acts as con¬ 
trary to “the natural use of 
women” - that is, child-bearing. 
There are, however, no recorded 
instances of the punishment 
being carried out. 

After the American Revolu¬ 
tion, separation of church and 


state became one of the founding 
principles of the new republic. 
Punishment for sodomy was 
gradually reduced to jail time and 
loss of property. Still, until 1961, 
all 50 states had some form of 
sodomy law. Today, most of the 
states with these antiquated laws 
on their books are in the South. 
Although rarely enforced, these 
statutes are used when convenient 
against lesbians and gay men, es¬ 


pecially in child custody cases. ▼

"Est on wheels?" Bike rider Bobby Singer questions the AIDS Ride's 
underlying philosophy. 


hausting week honoring people 
lost to AIDS can be an emotional, 
cathartic experience. 

But like The Hunger Project, 
organizers of the AIDS Ride do 
not admit to the ties between the 
group’s philosophies and tactics. 
This leaves some former riders 
still questioning why and how 
they became so devoted, then dis¬ 
enchanted. 

“I started to feel really sad, 
after having done it,” said Singer. 
“I’ve gotten caught up in the po¬ 
litical incorrectness of it all, and 
kind of forgotten why I did it to 
begin with and what an impor¬ 
tant experience it was for me.” 

Former employees of Pallotta’s 
company mention having been 
encouraged, but not required, to 
take a Forum course - courses 
that average $450 for a prelimi¬ 
nary workshop. Former AIDS 
Ride administrator John Haley 
mentioned that some employees 
took the Forum courses, while 
others joked about it. 

Like the AIDS Rides, the ma¬ 
jority of Hunger Project workers 
are volunteers. According to Gi- 
ambalvo, the majority, if not all, 
of the personnel on staff of The 
Hunger Project and its hundreds 
of “grassroots volunteers” had 
taken either est or Forum pro¬ 
grams. 

An oft-repeated goal of The 
Hunger Project is the goal stated 
by est founder Erhard: ‘I take re¬ 
sponsibility for ending starvation 
within 20 years.’ 

This statement is mirrored in 
the motivational speeches given at 
AIDS Rides, where the lofty goal 
of “ending AIDS within five years” 
has been offered as a sort of 
mantra for participants. 

The conceptual aspect of The 
Hunger Project bears similarities 
to the AIDS Ride. Participation in 
The Hunger Project begins when 
a person signs an enrollment card, 
stating “The Hunger Project is 
mine completely. I am willing to 
be responsible for making the end 
of hunger an idea whose time has 
come.” 

Even its founder had to blunt¬ 
ly admit those grandiose goals 
were improbable. “The Hunger 
Project is not about solutions,” Er¬ 


hard said. “It’s not about fixing 
the problem. The Hunger Project 
is about creating a context, creat¬ 
ing the end of hunger as an idea. 
We will learn what we need to 
know to make an idea’s time 
come, then we will know how to 
make the world work.” 

WCCO-TV’s Garvin Snell was 
among the bikers at the 1996 
Minnesota-Chicago AIDS Ride. 
His statements on his TV station’s 
website unintentionally attest to 
the “idea” of symbols taking 
precedent over action. 

“The whole point of the Ride 
is just to make a big statement,” he 
said, “and it’s a huge statement to 
make - to have 1,500 people out 
on their bikes. Just by being out 
here and doing it, we’re effecting 
change.” 

Dave King, editor of Columbia 
Journal in New York City, whose 
special sports-themed issue pre¬ 
mieres this summer, isn’t so sure. 
“I have a mixed relationship with 
that organization,” he said blunt¬ 
ly. “I did the first Boston-NY Ride 
and crewed on the second, and 
though it’s an amazing, terrific ex¬ 
perience both socially and athlet¬ 
ically, I have growing concerns 
about the cult-like aura of Pallot- 
ta and Associates.” 

So, is it a good cult, or a bad 
cult, or not a cult at all? Thou¬ 
sands of people credit such 
groups with helping them take 
control of their lives. Many riders 
come directly from a vulnerable 
place of either losing a loved one 
or countless friends to AIDS, or 
even recently seroconverting 
themselves. 

But is it a supportive environ¬ 
ment or a staged format created to 
exploit the emotionally vulnera¬ 
ble? How many AIDS riders even 
know they may be trained in the 
Erhard school of thought? Are the 
AIDS Rides the first gay version of 
the Forum, or as one former rider 
called it, “est on wheels?” 

Giambalvo’s extensive research 
conclusively proves the ties be¬ 
tween est and The Hunger Pro¬ 
ject, yet Hunger Project officials 
deny such associations. Pallotta’s 
Beverly Hills-based publicist, 
JoAnne Forster of Bragman, 
Nyman & Cafarelli refused to 


with Werner Erhard, satellite 
events, and other “transforma¬ 
tional” programs to individuals 
and businesses. Sold to employees 
and Erhard’s brother, Nathan 
Rosenberg, the for-profit corpo¬ 
ration was renamed Landmark 
Education Corporation, which 
pays Erhard substantial royalties 
from Landmark for the use of his 
“technology.” 

While The Hunger Project de¬ 
nies any affiliation with Werner 
Erhard or est, this is true only in a 
technical sense, according to Gi- 
ambalvo. “The Hunger Project 
was legally incorporated as a sep¬ 
arate charitable entity in the state 
of California. But the link be¬ 
tween Werner Erhard and his or¬ 
ganizations, both philosophically 
and in personnel, remains.” 

Forum fan 

“It’s a distortion to describe it 
that way,” said Gustavo Suarez, 
communications director for the 
San Francisco AIDS Foundation, 
when asked about est-ian ties to 
the AIDS Ride. “It’s a week where 
people bond. It can be a very 
beautiful thing. To compare it to 
est and a cult is invalid.” 

San Franciscan Bobby Singer 
disagrees. He noticed the “est- 
like” aspects of the Rides, and in¬ 
cludes that as one of the main rea¬ 
sons for not riding again. 

In the late 1980s Singer met 
Pallotta in a gay bar in Boston, he 
told the Bay Area Reporter. “He 
was heavily into est at the time,” 
Singer recalled. “I don’t know if 
people know that about him. I 
think there’s a lot of est and Wern¬ 
er Erhard in his work. 

“He tried to get me to do The 
Forum,” he said. “He talked about 
it all the time. It’s so much a part 
of who he is. I just thought it was 
kind of silly.” 

Singer noted how the Forum- 
type philosophy permeates AIDS 
Ride events. “There were all these 
inspirational quotes at places 
along the Ride. It definitely has an 
aspect of that.” 

Like many coping with the re¬ 
cent death of loved ones, Singer 
sought a place for his grief. “My 
mother and my best friend died 
three weeks apart. It was a pretty 
awful time. I don’t know how 
conscious I was of it at the time, 
but I needed something.” 

He bought a bicycle and start¬ 
ed riding around the scenic Bay 
Area, which he said “helped me 
release some of that anger. It was 
kind of meditative.” 

He had thought about doing 
an AIDS Ride, “not deeply, but 
just because other guys I knew did 
it,” he said. “It sounded like fun. I 
always felt like I wanted to con¬ 
tribute somehow. I thought of it 
as a way to memorialize these 
people, since I don’t really prac¬ 
tice any kind of religion. It gave 
me an opportunity to find a place 
to grieve, and people to do it with. 
It really helped me get in touch 
with those feelings and release 
them.” 

Obviously, spending an ex¬

west coast, he worked with Groli- 
er Society, Inc., which then was 
undergoing legal actions for 
fraudulent and deceptive sales 
techniques. 

Erhard’s study of many disci¬ 
plines became the foundation for 
est training, including hypnosis, 
self-motivation techniques, en¬ 
counter therapy, the Human Po¬ 
tential Movement, Zen, and Sci¬ 
entology. 

Ascending through five Scien¬ 
tology levels, he received over 70 
hours of “auditing.” Many of the 
concepts and terminology used in 
the est training come from Scien¬ 
tology. 

Erhard later took Mind Dy¬ 
namics and became an instructor. 
Mind Dynamics went out of busi¬ 
ness and was sued by the state of 
California for fraudulent claims 
and practicing medicine without 
a license. 

Erhard attributed the found¬ 
ing of the est training to a trans¬ 
formational experience on a free¬ 
way in California (the Golden 
Gate Bridge, sources claim) where 
he “experienced Self as Self in a 
direct and unmediated way. I did¬ 
n’t just experience Self. I became 
Self.”

Project with the AIDS Ride, simi¬ 
lar patterns emerge. 

The Hunger Project, “a non¬ 
profit, charitable corporation 
whose work is to generate the will 
to eliminate the persistence of 
hunger by the end of the century,” 
was established in 1977 and 
claims to educate people about 
the problem of hunger. It is not a 
relief, development, or lobbying 
group. 

Instead, it created what Gi- 
ambalvo, a former Hunger Project 
employee, called “a massive ex¬ 
pression of personal commitment 
by individuals to eliminate 
hunger. A network of volunteers 
carries out most of the work of 
The Hunger Project. It has ‘en¬ 
rolled’ over five million individu¬ 
als in the ‘commitment to end 
hunger.’” 

The Hunger Project has been 
the target of much controversy, 
mostly around Erhard, est, and its 
later incarnation, The Forum, 
which offers people “an opportu¬ 
nity to transform their lives.” 

Est, as such, no longer exists. 
Its name was changed to Werner 
Erhard & Associates and its pro¬ 
gram renamed The Forum. In ad¬ 
dition to The Forum, it offered 
seminar programs, special events

To serve Werner 

"If you blow somebody's mind, 
you can quickly slip in some data 
about being. Est blows the mind." 

- Werner Erhard in 
East West Journal , 1974. 

Psychology Today's August 
1975 issue implied est’s more self- 
serving goals as luring such peo¬ 
ple into its ranks, citing est’s end 
purpose as “to serve Werner and 
make est work,” and the methods 
of the est training: “Were going to 
throw away your belief system, 
tear you down, and put you back 
together.” 

Giambalvo summarizes the 
magazine’s findings: “It described 
the methods as designed alter¬ 
nately to confuse and enlighten 
subjects, to develop the authority 
of the trainer and build his sug¬ 
gestive power. The training con¬ 
tained common-sense psychology 
from which anyone could profit; 
simultaneously it was a masterful 
amalgam of consciousness-alter¬ 
ing techniques that powerfully af¬ 
fect the innocent subject. The au¬ 
thor’s description of several stages 
in the training demonstrated the 
step-by-step confusion and help¬ 
lessness experienced by subjects 
until they crack under the pres¬ 
sure and, in the helplessness of the 
moment (called ‘snapping’), em¬ 
brace the system'.” 

Comparing the earlier est con¬ 
troversies, Giambalvo cites legal 
actions charging emotional dam¬ 
ages experienced by subjects, in¬ 
cluding one death during est 
training. Other suits include non¬ 
payment of a $15 million loan 
and nonpayment of IRS taxes and 
penalties. 

In December 1978, Mother 
Jones magazine published an ex¬ 
pose on The Hunger Project, its 
connection with Werner Erhard, 
and its possible use as a recruit¬ 
ment arm for his est training. Au¬ 
thor Suzanne Gordon pointed to 
The Hunger Project as the first at¬ 
tempt by one of the “self’’-orient¬ 
ed movements to address social or 
political issues. She raised such is¬ 
sues as: who gets the money?; are 
people participating in The 
Hunger Project pressured to take 
the est training?; why, if The 
Hunger Project claims no connec¬ 
tion to est, is there an est seminar 
called “The Hunger Project Se¬ 
ries?”; why are Hunger Project 
telephones often in est centers 
around the country? 

New Internationalist, a world 
development publication, also 
questioned where all the intense 
activity of The Hunger Project 
was leading and whether it was 
capitalizing on people’s concern 
about world poverty or, as Gi¬ 
ambalvo puts it, “to insinuate the 
ideas of a mind-manipulating 
cult.” 

And like Pallotta, whose Bev¬ 
erly Hills home was purchased 
shortly after the second AIDS 
Ride, Erhard was involved in 
questionable financial activities as 
well. “He’s applied a corporate 
model to AIDS fundraising, but 
he’s making all this money and it’s 
supported by volunteers,” said 
former rider Singer of Pallotta. 

Forbes magazine began an in¬ 
vestigation of The Hunger Project 
and Werner Erhard in 1985, 
specifically about a lawsuit con¬ 
cerning a $15 million unpaid low- 
interest loan from Wolfgang So- 
mary of Zurich to Erhard. 

The Byzantine details involve 
international money transfers in 
the millions, and alleged false 
grants to the puppet organization 
Fundacion Soberana Orden de San 
Juan de Jerusalem that served as 
intermediary for the loan at a 2 
percent interest rate. This Costa 
Rican group had been set up by 


an Erhard friend just several days 
before the transfer and stood to 
benefit by receiving a major por¬ 
tion of the interest payments. 

Because of this and other con¬ 
troversies, the Peace Corps and 
other hunger organizations have 
dissociated themselves from The 
Hunger Project. The national 
board of directors of Oxfam, 
Canada passed a resolution that 
they would not endorse any activ¬ 
ities sponsored by The Hunger 
Project nor will they accept any 
funds from the project. The 
Hunger Project’s “Ending Hunger 
Briefing” program was barred 
from Toronto schools and from 
Ottawa and Carleton schools. 

True lies 

For Giambalvo, “Herein lies 
the heart of the ongoing contro¬ 
versy: Denial. Deception. People 
being enrolled into The Hunger 
Project and being asked for con¬ 
tributions were not fully in¬ 
formed. Volunteers, most of 
whom were est graduates, were 
kept so busy doing the work of 
The Hunger Project and immers¬ 
ing themselves in the ‘principles 
and abstractions’ that they very 
often could not see that there was 
a vast difference between what 
they were told to say to the gener¬ 
al public and what actually was 
being said to those inside the or¬ 
ganization regarding its ideology.” 

Giambalvo states, “The hidden 
agenda of The Hunger Project is 
to transform the world according 
to the ‘principles and abstractions’ 
of Werner Erhard. Hunger is just 
the vehicle. It could be any issue: 
peace, disarmament, prejudice, 
you name it.” 


Or AIDS. 

Giambalvo’s critique can easily 
be compared. “Hunger is an issue 
that most people would agree 
needs our attention. After all, who 
wouldn’t want hunger to end? 
How can you fault an organiza¬ 
tion with such a noble purpose?” 

The association between AIDS 
and hunger becomes clear; criti¬ 
cism of the Ride is seen as criti¬ 
cism of any AIDS fundraising ef¬ 
forts. 

“The Hunger Project uses its 
purpose to deflect criticism and to 
shame anyone who might criticize 
a ‘noble’ organization which has 
such a noble purpose,” Giambal¬ 
vo said. “This implies that a noble 
purpose protects an organization 
from deceptive behaviors and 
hidden agendas on the part of its 
volunteers, staff and the organiza¬ 
tion’s founders.” 

With obscure “principles and 
abstractions” based on Erhard’s 
“Source Document,” The Hunger 
Project nevertheless maintains it 
has no philosophy. Likewise, Er¬ 
hard says that the est training and 
The Forum have no philosophy. 
According to Erhard, it is nothing 
to be believed, since “the truth be¬ 
lieved is a lie.” 

Sacred cow 

Asya Kamsky was born in St. 
Petersburg, the Russian city for¬ 
merly known as Leningrad. Now 
a Californian, and a former AIDS 
Ride cyclist, she noted the diversi¬ 
ty of participants as a plus. 
“Straight and gay people were 
about half and half. A lot of gay 
people assumed it was a gay 
event.” 

The interaction between peo¬ 
ple is what she called a highlight. 
“No community should think an¬ 
other community is going to come 


and rescue them. We’re all people.” 

In 1995 Kamsky raised just 
under $10,000 while working for 
a company that did matching 
fundraising, a method she cites as 
very effective. She had not cycled 
extensively, but “living in the Bay 
Area, and before that in Manhat¬ 
tan, I have a constant awareness of 
AIDS. There’s always a feeling that 
you ought to be doing some¬ 
thing.” 

She started riding occasional¬ 
ly, then went to a meetings on 
how to raise funds. The meetings 
and training rides also condi¬ 
tioned participants how to do the 
Ride, not only physically, but 
mentally and emotionally prepare 
them for facing and conquering 
failure. 

For the first leg of the Ride, she 
then lived in Santa Cruz, and re¬ 
laxed at home and in a hot tub. “I 
really like biking and camping, 
just not at the same time.” 

Unable to ride in successive 
years, now that “it’s harder to get 
time off from work,” the software 
company engineer focuses now on 
in-kind services, mentioning a 
contractor who works for an AIDS 
agency and donates his skills as a 
better way for people to con¬ 
tribute. “Maybe its a fallacy to say, 
‘It’s AIDS, it’s a sacred cow. If Dan 
Pallotta’s so good, then maybe he 
should charge out the wazoo.’” 

While Kamsky did not quit 
doing the Rides for any reason 
other than inconvenience, others’ 
departures have arisen directly 
from the very nature of the events’ 
constructed passion. It is an at¬ 
mosphere that is typical at 
Hunger Project events as well. 

Former rider and Pallotta em¬ 


ployee John Haley mentioned one 
example of the similarity: in¬ 
stances when recruiters forced 
themselves to cry in front of po¬ 
tential riders at orientation ses¬ 
sions. That compares with Gi¬ 
ambalvo’s claim that Hunger Pro¬ 
ject’s Executive Director Joan 
Holmes “spoke in tears, with her 
voice cracking. Emotional manip¬ 
ulation got volunteers re-inspired 
and re-dedicated.” 

Similar environments of tear¬ 
ful confessions, followed by cheer¬ 
ing and adulatory speeches, com¬ 
prise elements of Tent City pre¬ 
sentations. Riders are in a con¬ 
trolled environment, exhausted, 
and may be questioning their ef¬ 
forts or losing spirit. Paid Pallotta 
staffers and volunteers reinforce 
the activities and pressure them to 
continue, some even beyond their 
capability. That corresponds with 
Giambalvo’s description of “the 
emotionalism used at conferences 
... influencing the volunteers to 
recommit themselves to more and 
more work.” 

The AIDS Rides also have the 
added inducement of physical 
stress: numerous personal web¬ 
sites created by riders speak of en¬ 
during painful knee injuries, 
while others describe persistent 
carpal tunnel syndrome induced 
by days of cycling. The exhaus¬ 
tion/relief pattern is similar to 
that of any recipe for creating de¬ 
voted converts - take volunteers 
to the point of physical and emo¬ 
tional exhaustion in a controlled 
environment, then saturate them 
with inspirational rhetoric. “We 
were certainly exhausted every 
day,” said former rider Singer. 

Having completed this ardu¬ 
ous journey, riders then feel em¬ 
powered. So too with the Hunger 
page 23 ► 


The exhaustion/relief pattern is 
similar to that of any recipe for 
creating devoted converts.

Two plead not guilty 
to murder of Billy 
Jack Gaither 


by Mark Norby 


T he mother of Billy Jack 
Gaither watched Eric 
Mullins and Charles Mon¬ 
roe Butler being led from the 
Coosa County, Alabama court¬ 
room back to jail Thursday, May 
27, fighting back tears over the 
death of her son. Following an ar¬ 
raignment hearing where the two 
pleaded not guilty to her son’s 
murder, Mrs. Gaither stood be¬ 
fore reporters with Randy 
Gaither, the victim’s surviving 
brother, as they told the media 
that they believe Mullins and But¬ 
ler are guilty and that “they de¬ 
serve the death penalty.” 

“If convicted, the only judg¬ 
ment I see is the death penalty,” 
said the 36-year-old Randy 
Gaither. He said his parents were 
devastated by his brother’s death 
and found it necessary to move 
from Sylacauga - the town where 
they raised their son - to the 
neighboring county “because liv¬ 
ing there brought back too many 
memories of Billy Jack.” 

Randy Gaither commented 
that the brutal murder February 
19, allegedly because the victim 
was gay, has spurned him “to do 
anything I can to see a hate crime 
bill passed in Alabama that would 
increase penalties,” he said. Alaba¬ 
ma is one of 19 states in the coun¬ 
try without laws prohibiting hate 
crimes against homosexuals. 

Separate hearings were held 
for Mullins and Butler who, on 


March 4, pleaded guilty to the 
murder of Gaither. But after con¬ 
sultations with their attorneys, 
Mullins pleaded not guilty to the 
charges and Butler pleaded not 
guilty by reason of mental defect 
or mental insanity. 

“He doesn’t have a mental de¬ 
fect,” Randy Gaither continued. 
“They planned this for two weeks. 
My brother never hurt anyone.” 
Randy Gaither said he didn’t 
know Mullins or Butler, although 
Butler’s grandmother “used to 
babysit me as a child.” 

Butler’s attorneys are Billy Hill 
and Haran Lowe, and Mullins’s 
attorney is Rod Giddens. Hill said 
he did not anticipate using the in¬ 
sanity defense, and rejects the no¬ 
tion his client is a sociopath. “I 
didn’t feel he was a cold-blooded 
killer when I took the case,” he 
said. “After all the investigation, I 
still don’t believe he is a cold¬ 
blooded killer.” 

Billy Jack Gaither was mur¬ 
dered after he was lured from a 
Sylacauga bar, beaten, thrown into 
the trunk of his own car, driven to 
a remote location, castrated, 
clubbed to death with an ax han¬ 
dle, then burned atop old tires 
doused in kerosene. Mullins and 
Butler confessed to the crimes two 
weeks after they occurred. Two 
days before he came to authori¬ 
ties, Mullins stated “God told me I 
needed to confess.” But at last 
week’s hearing Mullins requested 
that the court throw out his earli¬ 
er statement to investigators in 
which he had confessed to the 



Billy Jack Gaither 


killing. 

Hill said his client “will keep 
the door open if the state wants to 
make a plea bargain.” However, 
Giddens said it was too early to 
determine if a deal might be pos¬ 
sible for Mullins. “We’ve got the 
next 30 days for discovery,” Gid¬ 
dens stated. “Once we get the evi¬ 
dence, we must have a reasonable 
time to look at it. We could also 
call in our own experts to look at 
the evidence.” 

In addition to the not guilty 
pleas, defense attorneys filed a 
number of motions, including 
one from Butler asking that the 
case file, hearings, and the trial it¬ 
self be closed to the media. The 
motions will be considered at a 
June 24 pretrial hearing, where a 
judge could accept a guilty plea if 
either Mullins or Butler work out 
a deal with prosecutors. Both 
Mullins and Butler remain in a 
Coosa County jail. ▼ 


Jury recommends death for killer of 6 gays 


United Press International 


I t took a Jacksonville jury less 
than an hour Friday, May 28 
to recommend sentencing a 
man who has admitted killing six 
gay men to death in one of those 
murders. 


Thirty-seven-year-old Gary 
Ray Bowles got a new sentencing 
hearing in the 1994 bludgeoning 
death of 42-year-old Walter Hin¬ 
ton after the Florida Supreme 
Court overturned his first death 
sentence. The high court ruled 
that prosecutors should not have 
mentioned Bowles’s professed 


hatred of gays during the trial. 

Bowles also confessed to 
killing other gay men, but was 
only sentenced to life in prison in 
those cases. 

He will be sentenced for the 
Hinton murder later. The judge 
may or may not follow the jury’s 
recommendation. ▼ 


Justice is a drag in Florida 


by Penny Nelson, UPI 


A judge in Maitland, Florida, 
has granted a male defen¬ 
dant’s request for permis¬ 
sion to dress as a woman during 
his murder trial. 


Jabari Stephens, 19, was 
dressed as a woman when he was 
arrested late last year for the mur¬ 
der of Daniel Patrick McGrew. 
His attorney argues that allowing 
Stephens to dress as a woman in 
front of the jury is crucial to his 
defense. 


In granting the request, Judge 
Stan Strickland said McGrew 
must submit to the court the 
clothing he intends to wear at 
least three days before the trial be¬ 
gins. 

A pretrial hearing is scheduled 
for July 21. ▼

The first and only pill clinically 
proven to treat hair loss in men. 

PROPECIA is a medical breakthrough - the first pill that effectively treats male 
pattern hair loss on the vertex (at top of head) and anterior mid-scalp area. 

By all measures, the clinical results of PROPECIA in men are impressive: * 

• 83% maintained their hair based on hair count (vs. 28% with placebo). 

• 66% had visible regrowth as rated by independent dermatologists 
(vs. 7% with placebo). 

• 80% were rated as improved by clinical doctors (vs. 47% with placebo). 

• Most men reported an increase in the amount of hair, a decrease in hair loss, 
and improvement in appearance. 

*Based on vertex studies at 24 months of men 18 to 41 with 
mild to moderate hair loss. 


Scientists have recently discovered that men with male pattern hair loss have an increased 
level of DHT in their scalps. PROPECIA blocks the formation of DHT and, in this way, appears to 
interrupt a key factor in the development of inherited male pattern hair loss in men. 

Importantly, PROPECIA helps grow natural hair- not just peach fuzz-and is as convenient to 
take as a vitamin: one pill a day. 

Only a doctor can determine if PROPECIA is right for you. PROPECIA is for men only. 
Further, women who are or may potentially be pregnant must not use PROPECIA and should 
not handle crushed or broken tablets because of the risk of a specific kind of birth defect. 

(See accompanying Patient Information for details.) PROPECIA tablets are coated and will 
prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling. 


You may need to take PROPECIA daily for three months or more to see visible results. 
PROPECIA may not regrow all your hair. And if you stop using this product, you will gradually 
lose the hair you have gained. There is not sufficient evidence that PROPECIA works for 
recession at the temporal areas. If you haven't seen results after 12 months of using PROPECIA, 
further treatment is unlikely to be of benefit. 

Like all prescription products, PROPECIA may cause side effects. A very small number 
of men experienced certain side effects, such as: less desire for sex, difficulty in achieving 
an erection, and a decrease in the amount of semen. Each of these side effects occurred in 
less than 2% of men. These side effects were reversible and went away in men who stopped 
taking PROPECIA. They also disappeared in most men (58%) who continued taking PROPECIA. 

So start talking to your doctor. And stop thinking further hair loss is inevitable. 

CALL 1-888-806-3725 or visit our website at www.propecia.com today to receive 
detailed product information, including clinical "before and after" photographs.

Fropecia 

(Finasteride) Tablets 


Patient Information about PROPECIA® 
(Pro-pee-sha) 

Generic name: finasteride (fin-AS-tur-eyed) 


PROPECIA** is for use by MEN ONLY. 

Please read this leaflet before you start taking PROPECIA. Also, read the information included with PROPECIA each time you 
renew your prescription, just in case anything has changed. Remember, this leaflet does not take the place of careful discussions with 
your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss PROPECIA when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. 


What is PROPECIA used for? 

PROPECIA is used for the treatment of male pattern hair loss on the vertex and the anterior mid-scalp area. 

PROPECIA is for use by MEN ONLY and should NOT be used by women or children. 

What is male pattern hair loss? 

Male pattern hair loss is a common condition in which men experience thinning of the hair on the scalp. Often, this 
results in a receding hairline and/or balding on the top of the head. These changes typically begin gradually in men 
in their 20s. 

Doctors believe male pattern hair loss is due to heredity and is dependent on hormonal effects. Doctors refer to this 
type of hair loss as androgenetic alopecia. 

Results of clinical studies: 

For 12 months, doctors studied over 1800 men aged 18 to 41 with mild to moderate amounts of ongoing hair loss. A 
II men, whether receiving PROPECIA or placebo (a pill containing no medication) were given a medicated shampoo 
(Neutrogena T/Gel®*** Shampoo). Of these men, approximately 1200 with hair loss at the top of the head were studied 
for an additional 12 months. In general, men who took PROPECIA maintained or increased the number of visible scalp 
hairs and noticed improvement in their hair in the first year, with the effect maintained in the second year. Hair counts 
in men who did not take PROPECIA continued to decrease. 

In one study, patients were questioned on the growth of body hair. PROPECIA did not appear to affect hair in places other than 
the scalp. 

Will PROPECIA work for me? 

For most men, PROPECIA increases the number of scalp hairs, helping to fill in thin or balding areas of the scalp. 

Men taking PROPECIA noted a slowing of hair loss during two years of use. Although results will vary, generally 
you will not be able to grow back all of the hair you have lost. There is not sufficient evidence that PROPECIA works 
in the treatment of receding hairline in the temporal area on both sides of the head. 

Male pattern hair loss occurs gradually over time. On average, healthy hair grows only about half an inch each month. 
Therefore, it will take time to see any effect. 

You may need to take PROPECIA daily for three months or more before you see a benefit from taking PROPECIA. 
PROPECIA can only work over the long term if you continue taking it If the drug has not worked for you in twelve 
months, further treatment is unlikely to be of benefit. If you stop taking PROPECIA, you will likely lose the hair you have 
gained within 12 months of stopping treatment You should discuss this with your doctor. 

Hew should I take PROPECIA? 

Follow your doctor's instructions. 

■ Take one tablet by mouth each day. 

■ You may take PROPECIA with or without food. 

■ If you forget to take PROPECIA, do nat take an extra tablet. Just take the next tablet as usual. 

PROPECIA will nflt work faster or better if you take it more than once a day. 


Who should NOT take PROPECIA? 

■ PROPECIA is for the treatment of male pattern hair loss in MEN ONLY and should not be taken by women 
or children. 

■ Anyone allergic to any of the ingredients. 

A warning about PROPECIA and pregnancy. 

■ Women who are or may potentially be pregnant: 

- must not use PROPECIA 

- should not handle crushed or broken tablets of PROPECIA. 

If a woman who is pregnant with a male baby absorbs the active ingredient in PROPECIA, either by swallowing 
or through the skin, it may cause abnormalities of a male baby's sex organs. If a woman who is pregnant comes into 
contact with the active ingredient in PROPECIA, a doctor should be consulted. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will 
prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets are not broken or crushed. 

What are the possible side effects of PROPECIA? 

Like all prescription products, PROPECIA may cause side effects. In clinical studies, side effects from PROPECIA were 
uncommon and did not affect most men. A small number of men experienced certain sexual side effects. These men 
reported one or more of the following: less desire for sex; difficulty in achieving an erection; and, a decrease in the amount 
of semen. Each of these side effects occurred in less than 2% of men. These side effects went away in men who stopped 
taking PROPECIA. They also disappeared in most men who continued taking PROPECIA. 

The active ingredient in PROPECIA is also used by older men at a five-times higher dose to treat enlargement of the 
prostate. Some of these men reported other side effects, including problems with ejaculation, breast swelling and/or 
tenderness and allergic reactions such as lip swelling and rash. In clinical studies with PROPECIA, these side effects 
occurred as often in men taking placebo as in those taking PROPECIA. 

Tell your doctor promptly about these or any other unusual effects. 

■ PROPECIA can affect a blood test called PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) for the screening of prostate cancer.

Charles Pierce 

◄ page 1 

Performing Arts Library of Lin¬ 
coln Center, New York. By May, 
1999 the materials were cata¬ 
logued by the staff, and are now 
available to researchers. 

Born on Bastille Day in 1926, 
Pierce was named after his grand¬ 
father, Dr. Charles E. Pierce, and 
spent his youth in Watertown, 
New York. Beginning around 
1944, he worked at a local radio 
station WWNY, playing the Ham¬ 
mond organ and acting in radio 
dramas. In a vintage photo taken 
at the station, 18-year-old 
Charles, seated at the organ, is 
shown looking at the sheet music 
of “They’re Either Too Young Or 
Too Old,” a song Bette Davis sang 
in the Warner Bros, film Thank 
Your Lucky Stars. 

It was not easy for the critics to 
describe Pierce’s unique act, but 
when they did, he would happily 
appropriate the description. Ap¬ 
parently it was Herb Caen (in 
whose San Francisco Chronicle 
column Pierce appeared 50 times) 
who dubbed him a “male actress.” 
Another description he enjoyed 
was “the Master and Mistress of 
Surprise or Disguise.” When he 
played the Fairmont Venetian 
Room in the 1980s, the ads 
showed Charles as Bette Davis, 
holding a smoldering cigarette, 
with the caption, “The Last Drag.” 

Pierce’s first stand-up comedy 
routines were naively costumed. 
In a radio interview with me in 
1983, Charles said, “Through the 
years the act has had a lot of phas¬ 
es. I originally started in a tuxedo 
with a box of props. Then I start¬ 
ed working clubs in Florida that 
required a lot of changes in mate¬ 
rial, so then I started working 
more or less in drag, and I say 
‘more or less’ because Florida 
[laws] were very strict: You could 
wear black pants, you could wear 
a black turtleneck sweater, but 
you could not wear a dress. You 
could put feather boas on, and 
hats and gloves and pocketbooks, 
but you couldn’t be in drag. And 
so we did a lot of pantomimes, 
and then I would do my‘live’ ma¬ 
terial (maybe 10 minutes) at the 
end of that show. Eventually we 
ended up here in San Francisco 
(When I say ‘we,’ I refer to my 
partner at that time, Rio Dante), 
and we ‘holed up’ at the Gilded 
Cage for six years. We did a lot of 
pantomimes, and Mae West’s 
[rock and roll] ‘Treat Him Right’ 
was one of them.” 

In this same interview, Pierce 
told me he never took the imper¬ 
sonations too seriously, “I’ve been 
billed as the ‘stand up comic in a 
dress or ‘the grand impostor,’" he 
said, “but it’s all for laughs, it’s all 
for fun and comedy.” 

Through the years, Pierce’s 
reputation built up from playing 
small gay clubs around the coun¬ 
try, but San Francisco embraced 
him as no other town. 

John Wallraft, who attended 
the Pasadena Playhouse with 
Charles in 1947-48, reminisced, 
“He wanted to be a stage actor. He 
raced around Hollywood trying 
to get jobs. He went to a theatre 
group called Cabaret Concert, 
doing sketches a la Noel Coward. 
Back at Pasadena Playhouse, he 
played in Richard III. and played 
the Ghost of Christmas Past in A 
Christmas Carol, Pierce also did 
some summer stock in upstate 
New York before returning to Cal¬ 
ifornia. He had gone to see Arthur 
Blake - who did famous impres¬ 
sions of Bette Davis, Charles 
Laughton, and Tallulah 
Bankhead. Charles submitted 
some material to Blake, but Blake 
told him he wrote his own, so 
Charles said ‘I’ll use it myself!’ 


While Living at Algonquin Hotel 
in Pasadena, in the early 1950s, we 
went to see The Star with Bette 
Davis. Charles decided it was fod¬ 
der for a comedy parody, and per¬ 
formed it for me in his apartment. 
Charles and I started writing ma¬ 
terial, such as the Norma 
Desmond routine. At a Holly¬ 
wood party, he played for a group 
that included Harriet Parsons 
(Louella’s daughter), Jane With¬ 
ers, Franklyn Pangborn, and Mary 
McCarty. Charles did the tux bit 
in Altadena at Cafe La Vie, doing 
stand-up seriously. At various 
bars, he would improvise. Eventu¬ 
ally Ann Dee, of Ann’s 440 Club 
[in San Francisco] saw him in Al¬ 
tadena and signed him up for her 
club, where Johnny Mathis later 
got his start. 

“He then traveled to Florida, to 
the Red Carpet [in Miami Beach] 
and the Echo Club. In Miami he 
met his future show-biz partner, 
Rio Dante, and they started to do 
lip-synching. They also created 
the puppets, the Moppettes, head¬ 
less puppets Charles would put up 
to his own face and then perform 
outrageous dialogue and sugges¬ 
tive poses - with the likes of 
Shirley Temple, a Singing Nun, 
and a stripper. Rio Dante and 
Charles did a gig at the Statler 
Hotel in Hollywood and the Club 
Capri. Next stop was San Francis¬ 
co’s legendary Gilded Cage, 
around 1962, where he played a 
record six years. He made many 
appearances on television, but not 
always in drag: Dick Cavett, Fame 
(as a bag lady), Wayland Flowers 
and Madame, Love American 
Style, Chico and the Man, Starsky 
and Hutch, Laverne and Shirley” 

Through the years, Charles has 
had the best musical directors/ac¬ 
companists in the business, and 
they all admit to having learned a 
great deal about comedy and tim¬ 
ing from Pierce. Those who have 
accompanied him include 
Michael Biagi, Michael Ashton, 
Joan Edgar, Rio Dante, and 
Michael Feinstein (at the Backlot 
of Studio One, September, 1981). 
That’s three Michaels, a Rio, and 
a “real Woman,” as Charles used 
to call Joan in front of a scream¬ 
ing, adoring audience. 

Perfectionist to the end 

Joan Edgar, Pierce’s musical di¬ 
rector for seven years, said on the 
day of Charles’s death that she 
had marveled at the way he would 
constantly work on his act, even 
up to the final performance. At 
the end of a three-month run, just 
before the final show, in his dress¬ 
ing room he remarked, “Darling, 
you know that line where I say 
that our theatre curtain used to be 
Orson Welles’ boxer shorts? Well, 
it would sound funnier if I said “It 
was one of Kate Smith’s slack 
suits. You see, the sound of all 
those consonant ‘ks’ make it 
sound funnier ... or, how would 
it sound to say Rosemary 
Clooney’s caftan?” 

Restaurateur Les Natali, who 
produced several of Pierce’s shows 
at Bimbo’s 365 Club in the early 
1970s (a Blue Thumb LP was 
made of this show!) remarked, 
“I’ve had the pleasure of knowing 
Charles as a fan and a friend for 
30 years. He was always fun to be 
with, on stage and off, so witty, so 
sharp, so perceptive, and always 
ready with a line to provoke a 
laugh. What made Charles happy 
was making other people happy. 
And he was the best. I will miss 
him dearly.” 

Billy Saetre, a professional 
singer/friend of Pierce living in 
Munich, remarked, “There is a 
genuine warmth and love of the 
‘art’ of performing that so few 
folks have anymore. Of course 
being in the classical branch of 
performing, I see a completely 



different side of this silly world, 
where ‘genuineness’ is absolutely 
foreign. There is such a love of 
humour with Charles, and when 
he blows a line, or messes up a 
joke/story, he relishes in his own 
embarrassment as well as getting 
himself out of the situation. 

“I remember crying at his last 
show when he sang ‘Illusion,’ an 
old Dietrich number. There is 
something so poignant about him 
and his connection with an audi¬ 
ence. ... Charles Pierce completes 
the information from Alpha to 
Omega. Everything the audience 
not only wants, but needs to know 
is shared. No silly nonsense or 
mystery there. Gott sei Dank!” 

Russ Alley (General Manager 
of the York Hotel and Plush 
Room 1980-1983) produced 
more than 500 performances of 
Pierce at the York Hotel’s Plush 
Room. Alley later went to work 
for Rick Swig at the Fairmont, as 
director of public relations and 
entertainment. It was there that 


Alley convinced Swig to hire 
Charles Pierce, by showing him 
Pierce’s revenue had “saved” the 
Plush Room from closing. Alley 
remarked, “I had been trying to 
sell Charles to them for years. I 
showed Swig the numbers , and 
told him ‘Herb Caen will love it.’” 
And he did. 

Alley told me, “No matter how 
many friends we have lost over the 
years, it is always hard to picture 
this place without them. There 
will never be another Charles ... 
or a better Katharine Hepburn as 
‘Eleanor of Acquitaine’ (turkey 
waddle!) Maria Ouspenskaya 
(one of his Turban Ladies), Bette, 
Tallulah, those ratty foxes of his 
from way back ... Dietrich “I was 
on a fwight fwom pawwis to Los 
Angewis and both of my wegs 
were on the fwight wif me; one in 
first cwass and the other in 
coach,” and of course Jeanette 
MacDonald and that swing. 

“So many great memories.” 

John Epperson (The Fabulous 


Lypsinka) upon hearing of 
Pierce’s death, remarked, “Charles 
Pierce, the self-described ‘male ac¬ 
tress,’ was one of the funniest peo¬ 
ple in the world. He was also in¬ 
credibly generous. He had many 
successes at The Ballroom, a 
nightclub in New York City. In 
1991, when the management 
asked him to please come back 
again, he said, ‘Call Lypsinka in¬ 
stead.’ He was sorely missed by all 
of his fans for the last several years 
in all the venues where he was so 
popular. I know he will be greatly 
missed by his good friend Bea 
Arthur. When I saw Charles at 
The Plush Room many years ago, 
he acknowledged Bea, in the au¬ 
dience, as having the greatest 
comic timing in the world. He 
should know: Charles had the sec¬ 
ond best. Years later, I was per¬ 
forming in Los Angeles, and he 
brought Bea to my dressing room 
door and she intoned, ‘You’re 
mad, darling. Simply mad.’ 
(Thank you for that, Charles!) 

“A couple of years ago I saw 
Bea at a Bob Mackie fashion show 
in NY. She said, ‘Is there anything 
you want me to tell Charles?’ I 
said, ‘Please tell him hello.’ I wish 
I had said, ‘Tell him he’s an inspi¬ 
ration.’ For the name ‘Charles 
Pierce’ meant ‘magic’ and what he 
would call ‘madness.’ People who 
never saw him as Tallulah and 
Bette Davis - at the same time - 
don’t know what they’ve missed. 
(People who don’t know Tallulah 
and Bette don’t know what they’re 
missing!) People who did see 
Charles’s act know they saw a 
comic mastermind.” T 


A memorial will be held at 1 
p.m. Saturday, June 19 at the 
Church of the Hills, at Forest 
Lawn Hollywood Hills.

Feds ease up on pot research 


by Liz Highleyman 


n Friday, May 21, the federal 
11 government announced that 
it would make government- 
grown marijuana easier to obtain by 
academic researchers seeking to 
study the medicinal use of the drug. 

Government-produced 
cannabis, grown on a heavily 
guarded farm at the University of 
Mississippi, is currently the only 
legally approved source of re¬ 
search-grade marijuana for clinical 
studies. Many patients use 
cannabis to control AIDS-related 
wasting, to reduce nausea caused 
by cancer chemotherapy, and to al¬ 
leviate a variety of other ailments. 

The production and distribu¬ 
tion of marijuana for research 
purposes is tightly controlled by 
the Drug Enforcement Agency, 
and scientists such as Dr. Donald 
Abrams of the University of Cali¬ 
fornia at San Francisco have been 


forced to undergo a long and gru¬ 
eling process to obtain the drug. 

, Under the new guidelines, the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
part of the National Institutes of 
Health, will provide government- 
grown cannabis to researchers 
whose study proposals have been 
approved by a U.S. Public Health 
Service medical review committee. 
Scientists will be expected to pay 
for the marijuana to help defray 
the expenses of growing the drug. 
Disbursements of marijuana 
under the new guideline are not 
expected to begin until December. 

General Barry McCaffrey of 
the Office of National Drug Con¬ 
trol Policy (ONDCP) supports 
the decision to loosen restrictions 
on medical cannabis research. The 
agency released the statement, 
“This decision underscores the 
federal government’s commit¬ 
ment to ensuring that the discus¬ 
sion of the medical efficacy and 
safety of cannabionoids takes 


place within the-context of medi¬ 
cine and science,” and asserted 
that the new guidelines were not a 
reversal of existing policy. 

The guidelines note that 
cannabis used for medical re¬ 
search “must have a consistent 
and predictable potency, must be 
free of contamination, and must 
be available in sufficient amounts 
to support the needs of the study.” 

Medical marijuana proponents 
hailed the administration’s deci¬ 
sion. According to Ethan Nadel- 
man of the Lindesmith Center, the 
decision was “an implicit acknowl¬ 
edgment that the government has 
blocked research into medical mar¬ 
ijuana for explicitly political rea¬ 
sons for the last two decades.” The 
AIDS Action Committee issued a 
statement calling on the federal 
government and state and local of¬ 
ficials to “act immediately and 
make smoked marijuana available 
to those who need it,” even while 
research is underway. ▼ 


United Airlines 

◄ page 1 

and ground service equipment fa¬ 
cility, it must provide the no-cost 
benefits to its employees with do¬ 
mestic partners unless the airline 
obtains a stay, Aftergut added. 

If United does not seek a stay, 
the city will ask the court to lift 
the injunction. 

Boycott continues 

City officials were quick to 
claim victory at a hastily arranged 
news conference last Thursday at 
City Hall. “The court has given us 
a loud, judicious ‘yes’ for equal 
treatment,” Aftergut said. 

“The ordinance aims to fulfill 
in economic terms a promise long 
required in city contracts: that 
parties doing business with the 
city not discriminate based on 
sexual orientation or marital sta¬ 
tus,” Wilken wrote in the opinion. 

Jeff Sheehy, who helped draft 
the original ordinance that Super¬ 
visors Tom Ammiano, Leslie Katz, 
and then-Supervisor Susan Leal 
sponsored in 1996, said the Equal 
Benefits Advocates-sponsored 
boycott of United Airlines will re¬ 
main in effect. “When United 
complies with the law the boycott 
will be lifted,” Sheehy said. “It’s 
frankly homophobic if they con¬ 
tinue with the lawsuit.” 

Katz said she hopes United will 
come back to the negotiating table 
and discuss offering all benefits, 
including health and pension ben¬ 
efits, to the domestic partners of 
their employees. “United has ar¬ 
gued for months that this case is 


not about discrimination against 
people with domestic partners. 
Now is the time for them to turn 
those words into reality,” Katz said. 

Aftergut pointed out that earli¬ 
er this year, United agreed to 
abide by the city of Los Angeles’s 
living wage ordinance, which is 
much more expensive for the 
company than San Francisco’s 
equal benefits law. At the time, 
United spokesman Matt Triaca 
said the L.A. living wage law 
“made good business sense,” and 
that it was a “reasonable” law. 

Aftergut brought enlargements 
of court documents to the news 
conference, showing United’s own 
policy authorizes compliance with 
local benefits laws. Additionally, 
he showed off internal notes from 
a 1997 meeting about domestic 
partner benefits between John 
Samolis, former vice president for 
people services, and United 
Chairman Jerry Greenwald, where 
it was discussed getting unions in¬ 
volved and starting up “right 
away.” “No roadblocks,” the note 
stated. Notes from another 1997 
meeting between United officials 
show the airline was unwilling to' 
be the first to offer equal benefits. 

‘Significant’ case 

Aftergut called Wilken’s deci¬ 
sion against SDMI “very, very sig¬ 
nificant,” because it was brought 
by a business that was determined 
to be ineligible for a city contract 
because it wouldn’t comply with 
the law. The airlines, because they 
adhere to various federal regula¬ 
tions, have been viewed as some¬ 
what unique with respect to com¬ 
plying with the ordinance. In the 


SDMI case, Wilken granted the 
city’s request for a summary judg¬ 
ment and ruled that California’s 
marriage law and community 
property law do not override the 
city’s equal benefits ordinance. 
“Neither does the court find any 
evidence that the ordinance regu¬ 
lates an area fully occupied by 
state law,” Wilken wrote. 

SDMI, which has offices in 
several states, including Califor¬ 
nia, provides maintenance ser¬ 
vices to private and government 
entities for large electrical trans¬ 
formers. It submitted the low bid 
of $143,455 to maintain the city’s 
electrical transformers at Hetch 
Hetchy in 1997, but lost the con¬ 
tract when it refused to comply 
with the ordinance. SDMI had 
asked for an exemption from the 
ordinance, which the city denied. 

SDMI has stated in court doc¬ 
uments that it conducts its busi¬ 
ness in accordance with Christian 
biblical principles. 

ACLJ’s attorneys disagreed 
with the court’s ruling and plan to 
appeal. “This ruling changes cor¬ 
porate America by creating a cul¬ 
ture shift that legitimizes same- 
sex relationships,” said Jay Seku- 
low, ACLJ’s chief counsel. “The 
ordinance redefines the institu¬ 
tion of marriage and conflicts 
with the moral values of most 
Americans.” 

Cynthia Goldstein, with the 
city’s Human Rights Commis¬ 
sion, said there are currently 2,300 
companies that comply with the 
ordinance and offer benefits to 
domestic partners of employees, 
affecting over one million work¬ 
ers. ▼

A new KS treatment that 
you can apply at home 


ultraviolet light. While using Panretin® gel, you 
may experience some local effects such as redness, 
discomfort, itching, and skin peeling or flaking 
at the area of application. Other possible local 
skin effects include: rawness, surface or deep 
cracking, scabbing, crusting, drainage, oozing, 
or infection. Consult your health care provider 
for more information on how to manage these 
effects. Do not use Panretin® gel if you are 
pregnant or breast feeding. 

Your doctor can tell you more about Panretin® gel, 
how to use it and what results you may expect. 
For more information, call 1-800-964-5836. 


LIGAND 


Panretin® gel is an innovative, self-administered 
topical retinoid gel used to treat skin lesions 
in persons with HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. 
Your doctor can advise whether treatment with 
Panretin® gel is appropriate for you. 

Panretin® gel is generally applied two times each 
day. Its use should be evaluated by your doctor 
in relation to other treatments you may be 
taking. Panretin® gel can be used whether or 
not you’ve tried any other anti-KS treatments, 
but should not be used when systemic anti-KS 
therapy is required. 

Panretin® gel does not prevent the appearance 
of new lesions or the increased growth of KS 
lesions not treated with Panretin® gel. Patients 
using Panretin® gel should avoid prolonged 
exposure of the treated area to sunlight or other

Panretnr gel 

(alitretinoin) 0.1%° 

FOR TOPICAL USE ONLY 


BRIEF SUMMARY 

The following is a brief summary. Before prescribing, please consult full prescribing 
information. 

INDICATIONS AND USAGE 

Panretin® gel is indicated for topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with 
AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. Panretin® gel is not indicated when systemic anti-KS 
therapy is required (e.g., more than 10 new KS lesions in the prior month, sympto¬ 
matic lymphedema, symptomatic pulmonary KS, or symptomatic visceral involve¬ 
ment). There is no experience to date using Panretin® gel with systemic anti-KS 
treatment. 

CONTRAINDICATIONS 

Panretin® gel is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to retinoids 
or to any of the ingredients of the product. 

WARNINGS 

Pregnancy: Panretin® gel could cause fetal harm if significant absorption were to 
occur in a pregnant woman. 9-c/s-Retinoic acid has been shown to be teratogenic in 
rabbits and mice. An increased incidence of fused sternebrae and limb and craniofa¬ 
cial defects occurred in rabbits given oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day (about five times 
the estimated daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis, assuming complete sys¬ 
temic absorption of 9-c/s-retinoic acid, when Panretin® gel is administered as a 60 g 
tube over 1 month in a 60 kg human), during the period of organogenesis. Limb and 
craniofacial defects also occurred in mice given a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg on 
day eleven of gestation (about 127 times the estimated daily human topical dose on 
a mg/m 2 basis). Oral 9-c/s-retinoic acid was also embryocidal, as indicated by early 
resorptions and post-implantation loss when it was given during the period of 
organogenesis to rabbits at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day (about 15 times the estimated 
daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis) and to rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day 
(about 25 times the estimated daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Animal 
reproduction studies with topical 9-c/s-retinoic acid have not been conducted. It is 
not known whether topical Panretin® gel can modulate endogenous 9-c/s-retinoic acid 
levels in a pregnant woman nor whether systemic exposure is increased by applica¬ 
tion to ulcerated lesions or by duration of treatment. There are no adequate and well- 
controlled studies in pregnant women. If Panretin® gel is used during pregnancy, or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while taking it, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant. 

PRECAUTIONS 

Panretin® gel is indicated for topical treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma. Patients with 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were less tolerant of topical Panretin® gel; five of seven 
patients had 6 episodes of treatment-limiting toxicities—grade 3 dermal irritation— 
with Panretin® gel (0.01% or 0.05%). 

Photosensitivity: Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. 
There were no reports of photosensitivity associated with the use of Panretin® gel in 
the clinical studies. Nonetheless, because in vitro data indicate that 9-c/s-retinoic 
acid may have a weak photosensitizing effect, patients should be advised to mini¬ 
mize exposure of treated areas to sunlight and sunlamps during the use of Panretin® 
gel. 

Drug Interactions: Patients who are applying Panretin® gel should not concurrently 
use products that contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a common component of 
insect repellent products. Animal toxicology studies showed increased DEET toxicity 
when DEET was included as part of the formulation. 

Although there was no clinical evidence in the vehicle-controlled studies of drug 
interactions with systemic antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, 
macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals, the effect of Panretin® gel on the steady- 
state concentrations of these drugs is not known. No drug interaction data are avail¬ 
able on concomitant administration of Panretin® gel and systemic anti-KS agents. 

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: No interference with laboratory tests has been 
observed. 

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in ani¬ 
mals to assess the carcinogenic potential of 9-c/s-retinoic acid have not been con¬

9-c/s-Retinoic acid was not mutagenic in vitro (bacterial assays, Chinese hamster

aberration test in human lymphocytes) nor in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). 

Pregnancy Category D (see “Warnings” section) 

Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether alitretinoin or its metabolites are excreted 
in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the 
potential for adverse reactions from Panretin® gel in nursing infants, mothers should 
discontinue nursing prior to using the drug. 

Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 

Geriatric Use: Inadequate information is available to assess safety and efficacy in 
patients age 65 years or older. 

ADVERSE REACTIONS 

The safety of Panretin® gel has been assessed in clinical studies of 385 patients with 


AIDS-related KS. Adverse events associated with the use of Panretin® gel in patients 
with AIDS-related KS occurred almost exclusively at the site of application. The der¬ 
mal toxicity begins as erythema; with continued application of Panretin® gel, erythema 
may increase and edema may develop. Dermal toxicity may become treatment-limit¬ 
ing, with intense erythema, edema, and vesiculation. Usually, however, adverse events 
are mild to moderate in severity; they led to withdrawal from the study in only 7% of 
the patients. Severe local (application site) skin adverse events occurred in about 
10% of patients in the U.S. study (versus 0% in the vehicle control). Table 1 lists the 
adverse events that occurred at the application site with an incidence of at least 5% 
during the double-blind phase in the Panretin® gel-treated group and in the vehicle 
control group in either of the two controlled studies. Adverse events were reported at 
other sites but generally were similar in the two groups.

7 Edema, swelling, inflammation 

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 

Panretin® gel should initially be applied two (2) times a day to cutaneous KS lesions. 
The application frequency can be gradually increased to three (3) or four (4) times a 
day according to individual lesion tolerance. If application site toxicity occurs, the 
application 

frequency can be reduced. Should severe irritation occur, application of drug can be 
temporarily discontinued for a few days until the symptoms subside. 

Sufficient gel should be applied to cover the lesion with a generous coating. The gel 
should be allowed to dry for three to five minutes before covering with clothing. 
Because unaffected skin may become irritated, application of the gel to normal skin 
surrounding the lesions should be avoided. In addition, do not apply the gel on or near 
mucosal surfaces of the body. 

A response of KS lesions may be seen as soon as two weeks after initiation of thera¬ 
py but most patients require longer application. With continued application, further 
benefit may be attained. Some patients have required over 14 weeks to respond. In 
clinical trials, Panretin® gel was applied for up to 96 weeks. Panretin® gel should be 
continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit. 

Occlusive dressings should not be used with Panretin® gel. 

OVERDOSAGE 

There has been no experience with acute overdose of Panretin® gel in humans. 
Systemic toxicity following acute overdosage with topical application of Panretin® gel 
is unlikely because of limited systemic plasma levels observed with normal therapeutic 
doses. There is no specific antidote for overdosage.

John R. Auman 


John Auman died in his San Fran¬ 
cisco home May 25,1999. 

John was strong minded and fierce 
of heart. He was a complex man, and 
gifted with wit and intelligence. Those 
of us fortunate enough to know him 


well were the beneficiaries of his gener¬ 
ous spirit and his capacity for uncondi¬ 
tional support. 

John will be missed by many. He 
will never fade from the hearts and 
minds of Bill Morgan and Jack Poblocki 
of San Francisco, and Carol Bouton, 
James Latus, and Craig McMillan, all of 
New York City. 

Prior to moving to San Francisco in 
1995, John resided in Manhattan and 
was a Vice President at Merrill Lynch & 
Co. John was a graduate of Franklin & 
Marshall College and of Northwestern 
University’s Graduate School of Man¬ 
agement. 

Contributions in his memory may 
be made to The National AIDS Memor¬ 
ial Grove, 856 Stanyan St., San Francis¬ 
co, CA 94117. John was deeply commit¬ 
ted to “The Grove.” 

Plans for a celebration of John’s life 
are pending. For information, please 
contact Bill at (415) 776-4976. 

When we think of you, beloved 
friend, all losses are restored and sor¬ 
rows end. 

William A. Marchman 


Many friends and neighbors will 
deeply miss Bill Marchman, who passed 
away on Sunday, 23 May, at age 69. Bill 
was a consummate creature of habit and 
possessed qualities that endeared him to 
those who came to know him: a truly 


remarkable memo¬ 
ry, a quick wit, and 
a gentle heart. 

Bill’s early ca¬ 
reer was character¬ 
ized by his pro¬ 
found fondness of 
and expertise in 
maritime matters. 
After leaving his 
native Tampa, 
Florida, he underwent training at the 
U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New Lon¬ 
don, Connecticut, culminating in a 
commission as a Coast Guard navigator. 
His service with the Coast Guard in the 
Mediterranean and South Pacific fired 
his love of the sea and was a source in 
ensuing years of countless sea stories, 
including encounters with future kings, 
wizened Polynesian chieftains, and a pet 
monkey with a crack pitching arm. 

After leaving the Coast Guard, he com¬ 
pleted his MBA at Columbia University 
and entered the burgeoning computer 
industry as a systems analyst with IBM, 
traveling and training primarily in the 
eastern U.S. He moved to San Francisco 
in 1961 after nearly accepting a job in 
Southern California, a decision he never 
regretted: San Francisco thrilled him. 
Some years before his death he looked 
out from the Crown Room and reck¬ 
oned after living more than 30 years in 
San Francisco, he had still discovered 
only a tiny fraction of her charms. 



Where’s the community 
in community planning? 


by Michael Lauro, ACT UP/ 
Golden Gate Writers Pool 


ecently, Mayor Willie Brown 
announced a $2 million 
HIV Prevention Initiative, 
seeded with $1 million from 
DuPont Pharmaceuticals with the 
city of San Francisco matching 
that amount. The mayor stated 
that “the city will match DuPont 
Pharmaceuticals’ grant in an ef¬ 
fort to inspire other companies to 
follow their lead.” The mayor 
hopes to raise another $3 million 
from “other companies” for a 
minimum of $5 million, 
to be spent over the 
next five years. At the 
May 4 press confer¬ 
ence, the mayor stressed 
the need to target com¬ 
munities most at risk, in¬ 
cluding people of color, 
women, and young 
gay and bisexual men. 

Whether it’s $2 
million or $5 million, 
this represents a significant pool 
of prevention funds to be dis¬ 
persed. In 1997, by comparison, 
the last year for which complete 
information is available, the San 
Francisco Department of Public 
Health expended $9,854,934 on 
HIV prevention from federal, 
state, and local sources. Over 90 
percent of this money provided 
an array of interventions includ¬ 
ing HIV counseling, testing, refer¬ 
ral, education, and outreach, pri¬ 
marily through the network of 
private HIV/AIDS agencies oper¬ 
ating throughout the city. These 
same agencies certainly raise ad¬ 
ditional funds to support their 
own prevention services, although 
as one DPH staffer stated, “We’ve 
been trying for years to figure out 
what that total dollar amount is, 
without much success.” 

Almost lost amidst the fanfare, 
a new HIV prevention coalition is 
forming “to coordinate the initia¬ 
tive” by way of grants to already 
existing HIV prevention efforts 
and agencies as well as developing 
its own “innovative programs.” 
Currently, under the San Francis¬ 
co HIV Prevention Plan, DPH 
doles out the money after the 
community-based HIV Preven¬ 


tion Planning Council (HPPC) 
sets out priorities for these re¬ 
source allocations. Over 30 com¬ 
munity-based agencies and com¬ 
munity representatives sit on the 
HPPC. 

Who, what, and how? 

Several interesting - if not 
troublesome - points regarding 
the Brown-DuPont announce¬ 
ment merit closer scrutiny, how¬ 
ever. 

The first is the relationship be¬ 
tween this new coalition and the 
existing HPPC. It’s unclear what 
the precise relationship will be, if 
any, between HPPC and the 
“HIV Prevention Initia¬ 
tive” coalition. Early 
published articles 
stressed that the 

money would be “ad¬ 
ministered and award¬ 
ed by. a three-person 
committee.” Howev¬ 
er, in a press release 
issued from the 
mayor’s office, it 
states that “the initiative will be 
coordinated by a coalition of par¬ 
ticipating organizations (presum¬ 
ably AIDS organizations), mem¬ 
bers of the San Francisco Depart¬ 
ment of Public Health, and com¬ 
munity leaders.” 

Indeed, some HPPC members 
are privately expressing concern 
over whether this new coalition is 
another of Brown’s end-runs 
around the community planning 
process. They point to the well- 
publicized current controversy 
happening at HPPC’s sister advi¬ 
sory board, the HIV Health Ser¬ 
vices Planning Council, where the 
mayor has tried to reign in the in¬ 
dependence of that body more 
than once through a variety of 
means. That council prioritizes 
and allocates funds for AIDS/HIV 
services through the Ryan White 
CARE Act (as opposed to HIV 
prevention efforts). The mayor’s 
office has gone so far as to refer to 
that body as “the Mayor’s 
HIV/AIDS Planning Council,” in 
previous years. 

The time-tested community 
planning process embodied with¬ 
in the CARE Council is mandat¬ 
ed by the federal act that created 
it. Unfortunately, our local 


HIV/AIDS prevention process is 
not as insulated from acts of po¬ 
litical interference, and this new 
prevention initiative further cor¬ 
rodes that independence. 

The pleasure of the mayor 

The offices of Dr. Tom Coates, 
one of the three co-chairs of the 
new prevention coalition, stated 
that “the degree of collaboration 
as opposed to coordination with 
HPPC is still unclear” and that 
“the mechanism has not been de¬ 
cided yet.” 

What seems very clear at this 
early point is that this new coali¬ 
tion will work independently of 
the HPPC. The question of what 
the composition of that body will 
look like is just one still undecid¬ 
ed - or at least, unannounced - 
issue. Given that these new mem¬ 
bers of this far less independent 
body will be both appointed by, 
and serve at the pleasure of, the 
mayor, any appropriate mecha¬ 
nism must insure that the inde¬ 
pendent voices of the PWA/HIV 
community as represented in the 
HPPC are at the same table with 
the experts and the bureaucrats. 

For that to happen, the 
mayor’s office must hear from us. 
Phone the Mayor’s Office of AIDS 
& HIV Policy at (415) 554-5101 
and insist that the mayor gen¬ 
uinely engage our community in 
a process that is fair and inclusive. 

Sustained by Sustiva 

The other troublesome issue is 
the real cost at which this new ini¬ 
tiative comes. Reeling from the 
vocal attacks by AIDS activists 
around the world, DuPont was 
sorely in need of a public relations 
makeover. It seems that Mayor 
Brown was eager to oblige and 
will even be calling on other phar¬ 
maceutical companies to sweeten 
this new prevention pot. 

That the DuPont grant of $1 
million comes from the profit of 
its overpriced AIDS drug, Sustiva, 
is beyond question. Sustiva sells 
for about $4,850 a year. Its main 
marketing advantages of once- 
daily dosing and the possibility of 
substituting Sustiva for protease 
inhibitors in anti-HIV combina¬ 
tion therapies is not lost on its 

page 22 ► 



After retirement, Bill enjoyed the 
company of friends in several favorite 
haunts and traveled extensively, in part 
at sea, where he always seemed most 
content. His kindness and good will 
were precious gifts to all who knew him. 

John (Mancha) Akridge 

December 27,1967 — May 25,1999 


John was re¬ 
leased from the 
body that no longer 
served him on 
Tuesday, May 25th. 
A man of love and 
dreams, he lived his 
life to its fullest ca¬ 
pacity. He believed 
in who he was and 
the love he could 
share with the world. He was a regular 
guest star performer, as the male lead in 
drag shows, both in San Jose and San 
Francisco. Headlined as “The Original 
Latin Bombshell,” he supported many 
great queens on the road through the 
court system. 

When John became disabled, he 
switched his creative talents to exquisite 
crafting creations. His sequin shoes in a 
rainbow of colors, Genuine Genie Bot¬ 
tles, and detailed cross-stitch works 
once again displayed his inner beauty to 
the outside world. 

This gentle man will be missed by 
all who knew him. John, thank you for 
marrying me and being my loving hus¬ 
band. 


A celebration of John’s life will be 
held on Saturday, June 12 at 1 p.m. at 
the Lakewood Apartment Club House 
at 515 John Muir Drive in San Francis¬ 
co. 

Donations in memory of John can 
be made to Quest Clinical Research, 
2300 Sutter St., Suite 202, San Francisco, 
CA 94115. 

Mikael Duden 

August 1953 — July 1998 

A highly re¬ 
garded Bay Area 
actor, Mikael was 
proud to have been 
part of the under¬ 
ground gay theater 
of the early 1970s, 
when it was still 
stigmatized. Mikael 
performed with 
Theater Rhinoceros 
in Quisbys which went on to great suc¬ 
cess at the Kennedy Center in Washing¬ 
ton, D.C. This performance won him a 
Bette Award, an achievement he repeat¬ 
ed with his favorite role in Snake in the 
Vein. Mikael also opened in Boys in the 
Band and Strictly a Formality for which 
he won a Cable Car Award for Best En¬ 
semble Actor. He also had the title roles 
in Hamlet, Macbeth, and Dracula at var¬ 
ious Bay Area theaters. 

He is survived by his sisters Margie 
DeLuna and Lynette Gilbert, and his fa¬ 
ther Wayne Duden. He will be missed 
by many good friends.

in the review (that’s called an ad¬ 
vertisement in our country) but 
didn’t send a copy, I pretty much 
forgot about it. Perhaps my perni¬ 
cious former employers didn’t 
forward that hefty piece of mail. 
Who can say? Fortunately, one of 
my kindly benefactors offered me 
his copy. 

Five photographers from Ger¬ 
many, the Netherlands, Spain, and 
the U.S. have documented a di¬ 
verse array of sports and cultural 
events from Amsterdam, where as 
some of you recall, all sorts of 
things went on! 

Faye Jenkins, a featured writer 
in the Daily Friendship Gay 
Games newsletter, wrote the 
cheerful present-tense account, 
which includes interviews and de¬ 
scriptions in that charming style: 
“It is the first time that, a lesbian 
and gay film program has 
been presented in the 
open air! The audience, 
sharing bottles of wine 
and relaxing together, nev¬ 
ertheless watch with rap at 
tention.” 

The cheerfully revisionist 
text describes the 
Closing Ceremonies

Montreal male-pairs 
figure skaters (Kon¬ 
stantin Miranov and 
Stephane Vachon) while com¬ 
pletely omitting the fact that their 
little number was a choreo¬ 
graphed form of protest to the 
“Oops! No medals!” idiocy sur¬ 
rounding their event. But as they 
say, good times anyway, ya? Party,

his recent erotica

you’d think he’d

redundant, okay?).

the number of sports at GGV

we’ll have to trust the

claims 160. You also can’t identify 
folks featured in this full-color gift 
book, since there are no photo

It is, however, a splashy collage 
(Dadaist, perhaps?) of festive im¬ 
agery from what will be remem¬ 
bered as the most controversial 
yet diverse, Euro-inclusive Gay

The back section includes up¬ 
dated and apparently accurate 
scores for team and individual

ceived medals.

buying or ordering 8 Days at A

as many GGV participants can at¬

more, I don’t think any proceeds

Batting clean-up was Dana 
Van Gorder, the Department of

for lesbian and gay health ser¬ 
vices. “I want to commend the

the beginning of a much-needed 
discussion in San Francisco. Gay 
men are having a difficult time 
having conversations aground 
serostatus. It’s time for us to have 
a dialogue with gay men about 
how to take care of one another.” 

Neither the board nor Chris¬ 
ten had any comments following 
the public testimony. 

Board members and guests 


then broke into small groups and 
heard presentations on a variety 
of indicators of the AIDS epidem¬ 
ic, both in San Francisco and the 
U.S. All of the material was 
sourced and easy to understand. 
It included information on cur¬ 
rent estimates of HIV in San 
Francisco, based on DPH’s 1997 
HIV Consensus Report, AIDS 
cases in the city, hepatitis B and 
rectal gonorrhea rates in the city, 
state and federal HIV/AIDS-relat- 
ed legislation and spending, HIV- 
related housing issues, and AIDS 
Drug Assistance Program 
(ADAP) drug information. ▼

makers, DuPont Pharmaceuticals. 
Similar drugs in the same class 
(non-nucleoside reverse tran¬ 
scriptase inhibitors) are priced as 
low as $3,100 a year. 

The difference means that for 
many PWAs in many states and in 
many other countries, AIDS drug 
assistance programs will fall far 
short of what’s needed to keep peo¬ 
ple alive. Or more accurately, far 
short of the high price tag DuPont 


has created for its new drug. 

Glen Hillson of the Canadian 
Treatment Advocates Council said 
of DuPont’s pricing of Sustiva 
that, “AIDS drugs are already far 
too costly, and now the drug com¬ 
panies are escalating the problem.” 

Given that DuPont’s “generous 
gift” is borne on the backs and the 
bodies of persons with AIDS 
around the world, the very least 
that our mayor can do is ensure 
that the community-based HPPC 
be brought fairly into this process. 
Blood money should be able to af¬ 
ford that. ▼

AIDS Ride 

◄ page 13 

Project. Giambalvo states, “When 
a person completes a program in 
Werner Erhards Network, they 
are led to believe that he or she 
creates his/her reality and ‘can 
have it all.’ To keep that magical 
thinking, one has to disconnect 
with the people in their life that 
don’t think that way.” 

Similarly, AIDS riders are en¬ 
couraged to avoid debates over 
the financial problems of the 
Ride, and focus on the goal of 
completing the Ride, getting more 
sponsors and more money. They 
are repeatedly told their experi¬ 
ence is transformational, and that 
their lives will never be the same. 

This passage in Erhard’s biog¬ 
raphy furthers that sentiment. “A 
transformed individual demands 
transformed relationships be¬ 
cause only in such a context can 
he or she naturally express a 
transformed individuality.” 

Erhard says, “An effective siege 
on Mind cannot be directed only 
to the individual, as in the train¬ 
ing, but must be directed to rela¬ 
tionships and to the social envi¬ 
ronment, too. Thus, the larger est 
program has a revolutionary goal: 
to create the conditions - the 
space, the context - in the larger 
community to foster transforma¬ 
tion at each level.” 

Or the manufacturing of “a 
life-changing event.” 

Some karmic thing 

The Hunger Project’s Holmes’s 
motivational speeches even bear a 
similarity to the motivational jar¬ 
gon of AIDS Rides: 

“Raise the bar. You didn’t think 
you could go over it how high you 
raised it last time? You went over 
it. You’re a champion. Raise it. Up 
the ante. Press yourself into more 
brilliance. You’ve just begun. 
We’ve just begun. We’ve got a long 
way to go. You’re beautifully 
trained. You’ve put yourself to¬ 
gether well. Deliver on the 
promise. Raise the ante. And go 
for it. You need to raise the targets. 
You need to increase the gradient. 
You’re on a very high gradient. 
Don’t get off. It would be very 
dangerous to you. Things will get 
very messed up for you if you do 
that.” 

At the same time as speeches 
are made about riders “risking 
their lives” on dangerous high¬ 
ways, supportive rhetoric is also 
ingrained to prevent rider 
dropout, a common problem that 


Haley concedes he was trained to 
gloss over. Potential rider pledges 
are often used as the totals an¬ 
nounced, not the actual dollars 
ever collected. 

Singer questions the use of the 
enormous funds donated. “Sup¬ 
posedly the year that I did it, they 
raised $9.5 million. I was trying to 
find answers about the money, it 
was very frustrating not being 
able to get the information.” The 
information that did get out - 
from the Philadelphia lawsuit and 
failed rides - was either ignored 
or discounted by Pallotta staff. 

Even a spokesman for sponsor 
Clif Bar, Dean Mayer, accused sev¬ 
eral gay newspapers’ reports of 
problematic Rides as being “com¬ 
pletely untrue” before this re¬ 
porter mentioned which publica¬ 
tions had critiqued the Ride. 

“The individual has already 
been convinced that the group has 
the only answers and the outside 
world has lost its credibility,” Gi¬ 
ambalvo writes of The Hunger 
Project. “After all, the world does 
not really want to be transformed. 
In est and Forum seminars, we 
continually heard: If you don’t 
share your transformation, (en¬ 
rolling others) you will lose it. You 
need to be in a transformed envi¬ 
ronment, you need to be support¬ 
ed in doing‘the work.’You will lose 
your transformation if you leave.” 

Among the often-repeated 
statements of AIDS riders: “You 
don’t understand it unless you do 
the Ride,” echoing the exclusion¬ 
ary viewpoint of participants. 

“The Pallotta Rides market to 
that experience. I hope it’s some 
sort of karma thing. For people 
who have felt powerless, it is 
something they can do,” said Suzie 
Becker, creator of the Massachu¬ 
setts-based Ride FAR. 

Kamsky, however, discounts 
the est-like aspects of the AIDS 
rides, and was by no means “con¬ 
verted.” Her experience was more 
of boredom from the staged 
pageant-like events. 

“They had hours of speeches,” 
she said. “Presumably they were 
saying, ‘Look what these people 
did!’ But we were in a staging area 
a mile away.” 

She found inspiration from in¬ 
dividual participants. “Passing by 
a rider, they have a picture of 
someone on their handle bars. 
You know these people are dead. 
That’s what kept me going, real 
people who faced this.” 

Yet, she discounts the “vision” 
that riding will end AIDS. “Noth¬ 
ing really changed because I rode 
my bike. Some percentage of the

money went to people who really 
needed it.” 

Still, she remembers the glory 
of participating. “Watching it on 
Good Morning America, I saw my¬ 
self for a millisecond. If that’s 
what’ll get more media attention, 
more power to them.” 

Guru mentality 

But media attention to what 
end? A Bay Windows editorial 
questioned the motive, if not the 
earnest goals, of riders. “AIDS 
Riders, wonderful people that 
they are, ought to examine their 
goals and motivations for pedal¬ 
ing in this annual event... an ad¬ 
mirable accomplishment that 
proves stamina, commitment and 
courage. But commitment to 
what and to whom?” 

For the disenchanted, it’s more 
about Pallotta than AIDS. “I see 
more Dan Pallotta’s influence as 
some kind of guru,” said Singer. 
“The people working on it have a 
sort of adoration. I thought that 
was stupid.” 

This is a pattern that pervades 
est-derived groups and its similar 
“religion,” the Church of Scientol¬ 
ogy and its founder L. Ron Hub¬ 
bard. Members of both groups are 
known for their devotion to 
founders, litigious and personal 
attacks on critics and ex-mem- 
bers, infiltration in highly placed 
industry positions, and denial in 
admitting ties to such groups. 

Singer also saw in the AIDS 
Rides what Giambalvo notes as a 
common pattern of such groups, 
a highly hierarchical structure. 
“Not so much people doing the 
Ride, but the ones running it, just 
that whole organizations stuff, 
that the people at the top are un¬ 


approachable,” he said. “I thought 
it was ridiculous.” To Singer, the 
people at the top were somehow 
imbued with “the guru mentality.” 

Despite these misgivings, 
Singer raised $5,000, but “another 
reason I haven’t done the Ride 
again is that I don’t think that 
money did anything. It was hard 
to ask people for it, but at the 
time, people didn’t ask a lot of 
questions, they weren’t really cu¬ 
rious about where the money was 
going. A lot of people that spon¬ 
sored me were from out of state. 
They just trusted me, and that’s 
what I felt weird about.” 

Giambalvo alleges that the in¬ 
formation given in a Hunger Pro¬ 
ject briefing was “displayed in a 
way that allows the Mind to be 
by-passed because your Mind is 
fed by information. The Briefing 
delivers it [transformation] cam¬ 
ouflaged in a legitimate package 
called education or information.” 

Similarly, the AIDS Ride is re¬ 
peatedly credited as “raising 
awareness for AIDS,” when in ac¬ 
tuality, public information about 
the AIDS Ride includes neither 
safe sex information, information 
about HIV treatments, nor AIDS 
statistics or information about 
AIDS groups, other than the re¬ 
cipients of the Ride. Condoms are 
certainly not doled out to grand¬ 
mothers and children on road¬ 
sides. 

It should also be noted that the 
other recipient in the California 
AIDS Ride is the Los Angeles Gay 
and Lesbian Community Center, 
whose primary purpose is not as 
an AIDS service agency. 

“That’s how the est thing 
comes in,” Singer said. “They 
make it out to be something that 


it’s not.” 

Secret weapon 

By 1990, The Hunger Project 
initiated a program called Youth 
Ending Hunger (YEAH), a cam¬ 
paign for the Ending Hunger 
Briefing Program which targeted 
school children. 

Giambalvo quotes a speech by 
The Hunger Project’s Joan 
Holmes on how to convert eager 
teens to their cause: “Brief young 
people in a way so that the com¬ 
mitment to end hunger is located 
in them. And you know how irri¬ 
tating they can be. So, if they want 
something, they’re going to get it, 
aren’t they? I mean, they’re ruth¬ 
less people, and I consider it the 
kind of secret weapon of The 
Hunger Project to unleash them 
on the world.” 

Youth as well are riding in the 
California AIDS Ride. One such 
16-year-old, heterosexual but 
clutching a Tinky Winky doll to 
show his support of gays, as well 
as an AIDS Ride pledge sheet, re¬ 
cently approached a San Francis¬ 
co-based former AIDS Ride ad¬ 
ministrator. Although the former 
worker is disgruntled by the fi¬ 
nancial aspects of the Rides - 
“Just give your money directly to 
the AIDS group,” he usually urges, 
“the goal of making 75 cents on 
the dollar has rarely been made”- 
he was touched, and signed on as 
a sponsor. 

He told the B.A.R., “He be¬ 
lieves in what he’s doing.” T

Wagner’s 
16 -hour 
spectacle, out of 
the Opera House 

by Stephanie von Buchau 


® all it arrogance, cluelessness or just a death wish, but sev¬ 
eral Bay Area arts organizations have programmed 
events to conflict with the opening of the most antici¬ 
pated occasion on this year’s classical music calendar, 
the San Francisco Opera’s four cycles of Richard Wagn¬ 
er’s Der Ring des Nibelungen. Check this out for hubris: 

June 9 — Just as Das Rheingold, the first of four operas about 
incest and trollicide, unfolds at the War Memorial Opera House, 
KQED (Channel 9) airs an hilariously stirring documentary about 
the 1990 SFO Ring cycle, titled Sing Faster: The Stagehands’ Ring 
Cycle. I think we can assume that the 3,100 people in the Bay Area 
who most want to see this program (to say nothing of the 150- 
plus participants in the film) will be in the opera house that night, 
either watching or working on Rheingold. KQED’s comment: 
“They can tape it.” 

That same evening, Kent Nagano and the Berkeley Symphony 
present the one and only live performance of Philippe Manoury’s 
1997 opera, 60th Parallel, with orchestra, electronics and nine 
soloists (Zellerbach Hall, UC Berkeley). It’s true that Nagano-san’s 
scheduling problems are daunting, like those of the late Herbert 
von Karajan, who, when asked by a taxi driver “Where to?” replied, 
“They want me everywhere!” Still ... maybe BSO thinks we don’t 
care; someone who declined to be quoted suggested that Wagner- 
ites might not be interested in “the avant garde.” Newsflash: when 
he was alive, Wagner was the avant garde. 

June 10 — The Rings second evening, Die Walktire, just hap¬ 
pens to collide with the opening night of the San Francisco Sym¬ 
phony’s Stravinsky Festival (Davies Symphony Hall). Possibly SFS 
thinks it is doing us a favor by scheduling the rest of the two-week 
festival so that Wagnerites can actually attend symphony events, 
should our Sitzfleisch hold up for 6/9 Wagner, 6/10 Wagner, 6/11 
Stravinsky, 6/13 Wagner, 6/14 Stravinsky, 6/16 Wagner, 6/17 and 
6/19 Stravinsky. Great if you are from out of town and can sleep all 
day; not so great for those of us who work for a living. Never mind 
sleeping, when are we supposed to shop, vacuum the house or 
change the kitty litter? 

Okay, so that is a problem only for culture vultures who have 
tickets to the first Ring cycle. What about those who have no tick-

ive hundred years after they 
kicked the Jews out of 
Spain, we returned — last 
week, for an in-depth investiga¬ 
tion into the burning issues of 
Spanish wine, art, and men. We 
found all three areas of inquiry 
held up quite remarkably, even if 
we ourselves were a gelatinous 
mess by the end. 

Spaniards are on a different 
clock. They regularly don’t have 
supper until sometime ’round 
midnight, so we survived by hang¬ 
ing around tapas bars and order¬ 
ing by a method we called “point- 
and-click,” gesturing to a snack 
(olives, caviar, the ubiquitous 
ham) we think looked good, and 
washing it down with creamy cava 
(Spanish champers). Bartenders in 
Espana will shake their head and 
insist you do not want the brand 
of champagne you just ordered, 
then bring you their own choice. 
And of course they were right. 

Yes, we hit all the requisite' 
sights in Barcelona — toured 
Gaudi modernisme architecture 
and the Museo Picasso, strolled 
the Barrt Gotic and the Ramblas 
down past the birdstalls to the 
port quarter. At the harbor, a huge 
statue of Columbus points the 
way to the New World — except 
he’s pointing in the opposite di-

rection. Well, it’s the idea that 
counts. In the market, we gaped at 
amazing piles of supposedly edi¬ 
ble innards, and squid heads the 
size of babies. Later, our friend 
the website journalist 
amused us by ordering 
whole squid faces at 
the bar and devouring 
them in a gulp. 

We made new 
friends in the Pla^eta Pi 
who took us home to 
their barrio, Barcelone- 
ta, for an authentic 
experience. We 
went to a fisher¬ 
man’s bar for beer 
and fresh sardines, and were sit¬ 
ting by the door when a shirtless 
neighborhood youth burst in, 
shoved us aside and vaulted over 
the bar, fleeing through the back 
door from a policeman who fol¬ 
lowed in hot pursuit, knocking 
over drinks and nibblies, billyclub

swinging. 

It was a little too much local 
color for us, and our new friends 
were deeply embarrassed, insist¬ 
ing this was a rare display. 
But we agreed with them 
that, as opposed to 
back in the U.S. of A., 
at least the cops here 
carried no guns. To 
get our equilibrium 
back, we had to sit on 
the playa, watch the 
Mediterranean roll in, 
and smoke a hash 
cigarette or two. 

Back uptown, 
we went to the gay* 
Este bar, and the Cafe Dietrich 
showclub. Everyone there was hip 
and stylish in that Catalan way, 
and they use ice in their drinks, 
which puts them one up on the 
British. At the Thermos Sauna, 
there’s a pool, jacuzzi, cold 
plunge, bar, and rooms that lock 
— but in a way, it’s less “private” 
than SF sex clubs, because the 
men are being so perpetually so¬ 
cial and chatty — and smoking, 
all the time, including in the 
sauna! The establishment does, 
however, provide “Tu Y Yo” profi- 
lacticos. 

Forget olive oil and muscatel, 
Espana has such a surfeit of 
beautiful dark-eyed men, she 
could safely export half of them 
and still have a full supply. Their 
faces are lined with sun and char¬ 
acter. They speak a rapid Spanish 
in deep, chesty voices. We wanted 
to smuggle one home through 
customs, but he wouldn’t fit in 
our bags.

Deja vu all over again 

Talking with 'Key West' playwright Jack Heifner 


by Richard Dodds 


J ack Heifner, author of a 
“clothing optional” comedy 
opening this week, is a play¬ 
wright with post-partum frustra¬ 
tions. The prolific playwright and 
part-time college instructor was 
stuck in a small Texas town 
preparing for finals as his new 
play Key West went into rehearsals 
at the New Conservatory Theatre 
Center. 

“I’ve never had a new script go 
into rehearsals and previews with¬ 
out my being there,” Heifner said 
recently from Nacogdoches, 
Texas. “I’m sure I’m going to be a 
bit of a mess when I do get to San 
Francisco.” 

Key West will be Heifner’s fifth 
play done at New Conservatory, 
which staged a male version of his 
huge hit Vanities in addition to A 
Boy's Play, Heartbreak, and Com¬ 
fort and Joy. Key West will be the 
first one to have its world pre¬ 
miere at NCTC. “It’s been a diffi¬ 
cult play for me to write for some 
reason,” he said, “so I really want 
to get there and see what I’ve got.” 

Early audiences got to see the 
play before its author did, who ar¬ 
rived after previews had begun. 
“They scheduled a long preview 
period so I can make some 
changes,” Heifner said, “but I 
don’t see myself throwing out an 
act. So far I haven’t heard any¬ 
thing bad from the director.” 

Ed Decker, founder and artis¬ 
tic director of New Conservatory, 
is staging Key West, and it was he 
who asked Heifner for a new work 
to close out the current Pride Sea¬ 
son of gay plays. “I know he want¬ 
ed something fun,” the playwright 
said, “but I can’t really write a 
goofy play that’s not about some¬ 
thing. It may be more serious than 
he wanted.” 

Nudity is a given in this play, 
which takes place at a clothing- 
optional gay resort in Key West, 
although it was not specifically re¬ 
quested by Decker. “But having 
done four other plays at New 
Conservatory, I happen to know 
what sells,” Heifner said. “One of 
the plays, Heartbreak, didn’t have 
anyone taking off their clothes, 
and no one came to see it. I’ve 
never written anything before that 
was calculated to get them out of 
their clothes, but I thought the 
very nature of the resort at least 
makes it part of the environ¬ 
ment.” 

The play focuses on the occu¬ 
pants of two guest houses, where 
friendships are tested, romances 
are explored, and memories are 
rattled. “I named the place where 
they are staying the Deja Vu be¬ 
cause there are a lot of memories 
for old friends who have come 
back to Key West. I was trying to 
deal with feeling good about 
yourself as you get older.” 

Key return 

To seek inspiration for the 
play, Heifner himself returned to 
Key West for the first time since 
the disco ’70s, when he was a 
young playwright with a hit play. 
Vanities, which followed three 
girlfriends from high school to 
college to very different adult- 
hoods, brought the Texas native 
sudden fame and fortune when it 
opened a long run off-Broadway 
in 1976. 

“That was a pretty miraculous 
time for me,” Heifner said. “I 
spent all the money, but I had a 


good time.” 

Heifner had already come out 
by the time Vanities opened, 
though it’s only in his later plays 
that he began to explore gay char¬ 
acters and themes. “I’ve never 
considered myself a gay writer,” he 
said. “I am a writer who is gay. I 
would like to think I can write 
whatever I want to write.” 

Heifner, who’s in his early'50s, 
has written several times about 
small-town Texas, and he thinks 
there are probably a couple of 
more Texas plays in him. He grew 
up in Corsicana, Texas, where he 
had a boyfriend from age 13 
through college. They’d sleep to¬ 
gether after they dropped their 
dates off. 

“When I first got to SMU, I 
played the frat-guy game,” he said. 
“It was a bit of a double life, going 
to the gay bars in Dallas and also 
being the straight preppy guy at 
school. I found it exciting to be an 
SMU boy running around with 
these older men in the gay com¬ 


munity. We were very sought 
after. I went to a lot of parties. I 
was working it.” 

He graduated from SMU in 
1968, but didn’t head to New York 
for another five years. All he knew 
was that he wanted to be in the 
theater, and he worked both back- 
stage and as an actor. In his spare 
time, he wrote a play and then an¬ 
other. The second one was Vani¬ 
ties, and the first production was 
like an SMU reunion. Fellow 
classmates involved included ac¬ 
tress Kathy Bates, director Gar¬ 
land Wright, and producer Milton 
Justice. 

Heifner, Wright, and Justice 
w^re also a team on Heifner’s first 
and only Broadway production, 
the short-lived Patio/Porch in 
1978. It was the beginning of a 
dry spell for Heifner. “You begin 
to think it was all some sort of ac¬ 
cident and that you will never 
write anything successful again,” 
he said. 

But Heifner persevered, and 


now has 25 plays to his credit. 
While none has come close to 
matching the success of Vanities, 
he believes many to be vastly su¬ 
perior to his early hit. “It was the 
right play at the right time,” he 
said of Vanities, “but now when I 
look at it, I just think it is so sim¬ 
plistic.” 

Director Garland Wright died 
last year after a long battle with 
cancer, and Heifner found himself 
thinking about his old friend 
while he was writing Key West. 
“He lived in my apartment during 
his last two years, and I was one of 
his primary caretakers during all 
that,” Heifner said. “I think there 
is a sense of growing older and of 
things passing that have found 
their way into the play. But I did 
not want to write a play about 
people dying. I wanted this to be a 
play full of hope. Older men are 
attractive and can get younger 
men, or whatever it is they want.” 

Heifner paused to consider 
what he had just said. “I’m not

sqre that’s true. Maybe it’s a fairy 
tale. I don’t know. At this point, I 
don’t have any idea of what I’ve 
written.” ▼

Premature Tony syndrome 


by John F. Karr 


' - pring to me has always been 
when the Original Cast Al¬ 
bums appear, and summer 
starts when the Tony Awards are 
on TV. But before looking at the 
recordings of the shows vying for 
this years Tonys, let’s pause and 
present a Lifetime Achievement 
Award to Barbara Cook. 



Lacking a clear center, or some 
thematic linkage, Barbara Cook’s 
All I Ask of You, on the DRG label, 
skips by a bit too easily. This im¬ 
pression is abetted perhaps by the 
rather shallow recording of the 
full orchestra that accompanies 
her, and by the fact that with two 
songs as well as a 12-minute She 
Loves Me medley that Barbara has 
recorded previously, there’s not 
much over a half-hour of new 
material. That said, Barbara 
sounds great, singing nimbly, 
lightly, with grace, humor, and 
the wisdom of her years — as well 
as the high C she unveiled when 
She Loves Me opened 35 years 
ago! She’s meltingly lovely on 


“Somewhere,” achingly lovely on 
a revisit to “In Buddy’s Eyes,” and 
haunting on a valedictory “We’ll 
Be Together Again.” Other new 
material includes the big ballad 
from Phantom of the Opera, and 
Harold Arlen’s “I Wonder What 
Became of Me.” The album is a 
lovely visit with a cherished star, 
who sounds, wondrously, like 
she’ll never say goodbye. 



And now to present the Best 
Musical Award, with the handi¬ 
cap of not having seen any of the 
shows. It’s impossible to judge 
Fosse from its RCA Victor cast 
recording, which might be a good 
souvenir for those who’ve seen 
the dance anthology. But on CD, 
the endless noodling of the dance 
arrangements, served up by 
cheesy synthesizers, makes for a 
lot of padding. Its performers 
lack star power, and the orchestra 
lacks the snap of the original 
recordings. It all sounds dutifully 
learned and professionally per¬ 
formed. 

Not so Parade, also on RCA 
Victor. This is the most surpris¬ 
ing debut of a theatre composer 



I’ve heard since Anyone Can 
Whistle. Jason Roberts Brown’s 
score is an enthralling procession 
of exciting ensembles and pas¬ 
sionate solos, presented with 
smashing performances and im¬ 
pressive orchestral arrangements 
(some of them even bringing 
Charles Ives to Broadway!). T$e 
musical is about the 1915 lynch¬ 
ing of a falsely accused Jewish 
man by an hysterical vigilante 
mob, and takes every advantage 
for musical drama in probing the 
causes and results of the event. 
Clearly the Best New Musical, it’s 
also a memorable recording, 
making you eager to see a pro¬ 
duction of the show. 

Big guns 

Which is the exact opposite of 
the effect provided by the new 
Annie Get Your Gun, an Angel 
CD, starring Bernadette Peters 
and Tom Wopat. Perhaps it’s be¬ 
cause the revised script presents 
the central relationship as a play- 
within-a-play, but the stars seem 
to skim their material as if this 
were a revue; this revival lacks the

coin' Center Annie, on RCA Vic¬ 
tor. Bernadette seems to stand 
outside the role, playing cute, 
with a backwoods accent that 
comes and goes. Even her fine 
singing on the ballads sounds un¬ 
committed. And though Mr. 
Wopat may be easy on the eye, 
he’s a bit too easy on the ear, es¬ 
pecially since “My Defenses Are 
Down” has been neutered into a 
lounge routine. Despite Wopat’s 
casual charm, I miss the virile 
high baritone sound his prede¬ 
cessors brought to the role. Still, 
here’s a hit parade of a score, with 
two undeniable stars and a 
recording whose sound has front- 
row seat impact. 



Those three shows are the big 
guns on Broadway. But you’ll 
have lots of fun with a lesser en¬ 
tree, the DRG recording of For¬ 
bidden Broadway Cleans Up Its 


Act! This is the fifth Forbidden 
Broadway, but the show’s parody 
lyrics are freshly acute zingers. I 
especially like the Chicago satire: 
“Give ’em the old glossy Fosse,” it 
says. “Though the production 
may be shoddy, Everyone likes a 
naked body.” There’s an hysterical 
Ann Miller send-up, “I’m Still 
Weird,” a really nasty roast of 
Ragtime that had me rolling, and 
a well-deserved dig at you-know- 
who, “Super-Frantic-Hyper-Ac- 
tive-Self-Indulgent-Mandy,” 
given a swell performance by 
Bryan Batt. And if, like me, the 
handsome Batt gives you a boner, 
there’s a picture of him in the 
booklet with his shirt off. 

Other new cast albums include 
the rather irritatingly brash colli¬ 
sion with Cole Porter called High 
Society, a DRG recording. Origi¬ 
nally a more gracious movie mu¬ 
sical with classy songs represent¬ 
ing classy people, this stage ver¬ 
sion substitutes clash for class. It 
pushes and prods the songs, 
speeds everything up, and asks the 
performers to force their effects. 
And then there’s Fame, also on the 
DRG label, which, like the current 
Footloose, makes me look forward 
to the day when they don’t write 
them like this anymore. Only the 
title tune remains from the movie. 
The new songs are aerobic work¬ 
outs and shapeless ballads, sung 
off-key (the kids) and harsh (the 
teachers). Help! 

Finally, please treat yourself to 
the warmly symphonic recording 
of 110 in the Shade, a Jay double 
CD. It’s note complete, and vi¬ 
brantly conducted. The current 
stars are neither as passionate 
(her) or sexy (him) as the origi¬ 
nal cast, but they sing fabulously, 
and the score is glorious. They re¬ 
ally don’t write them like this 
anymore. Pity. ▼

Silver lining 

'Beach Blanket Babylon' turns 25 


by Richard Dodds 


tp he street sign at the corner 

|| of Green and Stockton uses 

tit a small prosthetic device to 
help support the extra words. For 
one block, Green Street gives up 
its name to Beach Blanket Baby¬ 
lon Boulevard, one case where re¬ 
naming a street didn’t cause a 
fuss. Maybe that’s because the 
boulevard’s namesake attraction 
fills the block eight times a week 
with smiling faces. 

That was certainly the case at a 
recent performance of Beach 
Blanket Babylon, which will cele¬ 
brate its 25th anniversary on June 
7 with a special performance at 
the Herbst Theatre. At Club 
Fugazi, the show’s longtime 
home, the out-of-towners may 
have outnumbered the locals, but 
the cast wasn’t in any worn-out 
tourist-trap mode. For 90 min¬ 
utes, the capacity crowd of 400 sat 
in grinning awe as the cast piloted 
the revue of visual puns, parody 
songs, outlandish characters, and 
big hats as if it were an SST. 

In some ways it always has 
been an SST — a Steve Silver 
Transport. Silver, a native San 
Franciscan, created the first ver¬ 
sion of Beach Blanket Babylon 
back in 1974 for $800. Practically 
overnight, the unfocused street- 
smart entrepreneur had a full¬ 
time — and as it turned out, life¬ 
time — career. 

Silver learned he was HIV-pos- 
itive in 1984 and kept it a secret 
until the illness became full¬ 
blown six years later. Even then, 
he told only his closest friends and 
colleagues, finally sharing the un¬ 
happy news with his cast (and the 
world) in 1994, when his famous 
overdrive energy began to fail. Sil¬ 
ver was 51 when he died on June 
12,1995. 

“To me, he and the show are 
the same thing,” said Kenny Ma- 
zlow, who became the show’s 
artistic director following Silver’s 
death. “Steve Silver is Beach Blan¬ 
ket Babylon, and Beach Blanket 
Babylon is Steve Silver.” 

But Silver very much wanted 
the show to live on as his legacy, 
and as he felt his time growing 
short, began putting into place a 
set of successors. Mazlow, who 
joined the show as a performer in 
1988 before becoming the show’s 
assistant director and choreogra¬ 
pher, was given more and more re¬ 
sponsibilities before Silver’s death. 

Although Mazlow was one of 
the first people Silver told about 
his illness, it was not a topic to 
which the fiercely private Silver 
frequently returned. “I never 
knew what was happening,” Ma¬ 
zlow said. Did it feel as if Silver 
was^passing on the reins? “It’s still 
hard to accept him not being 
here,” he said, “so it’s hard to an¬ 
swer that question.” 

Reverent relevance 

It’s unlikely that many among 
current Beach- goers realize the 
reverence that fuels the on-stage 
zaniness. Silver has been dead for 
nearly four years, but those who 
have been carrying on in his ab¬ 
sence show little interest in 
putting their own stamp on the 
show, even when the topical show 
must be adjusted to reflect recent 
headlines. 

“What would Steve do?” has 
become the mantra that guides 
the creative team headed by Ma¬ 
zlow and Jo Schuman Silver. “And 
we all still try to make him laugh,” 


Mazlow said. “I very much do feel 
his presence. It’s not like a voodoo 
thing where I’m trying to channel 
him, but there are qualities that he 
had that have become a part of 
me.” 

Mazlow was sitting in the Club 
Fugazi balcony while on stage 
below, Schuman Silver was check¬ 
ing out the costume on a Monica 
Lewinsky look-alike. Schuman 
Silver had been Steve Silver’s best 
friend since 1982, but it was still a 
surprise when they married just 
months before his death. He left 
the show to her, and she now car¬ 
ries the title of producer of Beach 
Blanket Babylon. 

Many assumed Silver was gay, 
though it was an issue that appar¬ 
ently remained unresolved for 
him and certainly not a subject he 
wished to address publicly. 
There’s little that is overtly gay in 
the current edition of Beach Blan¬ 
ket Babylon, although there is an 
Ellen DeGeneres sight gag, as well 
as the swishing King Louis char¬ 
acter that has been a staple for 
years. 

At times, perceptions of Beach 
Blanket Babylon have led to disap¬ 
pointment. When the show trav¬ 
eled to London in 1997, the the¬ 
ater critic for the Financial Times 
wrote, “If you expect the gay com¬ 
munity to present a musical heav¬ 
ing with bitchy innuendo and 
salacious gossip, wise up: Beach 
Blanket Babylon is about as mali¬ 
cious as Bambi.” 

Mazlow, who is gay, figures 
some of that reputation evolved 
simply because the show hails 
from San Francisco. “When the 
show opened,” he said, “it had a 
heavy gay following because the 
gay community is so supportive 
of new and different things, but 
over the years the audience has 
become very mainstream. The 
show itself never, tries to be a gay 
show or a straight show.” 

Although Mazlow recalls the 
naysayer in the Financial Times, 
he prefers to quote from the crit¬ 
ic in The Times of London. “He 
wrote that Beach Blanket Babylon 
unlocks the feel-good factor in all 
of us,” Mazlow said. “I really be¬ 
lieve that.” 

Audiences arrive keyed for a 
good time, and the fast-paced, 
high-energy show delivers. Keep¬ 
ing the cast fresh isn’t that big a 
challenge, Mazlow said. “For the 
most part, the performers love 
what they do,” he said. “And since 
we’re sold out every night, once 
those curtains open, you can feel 
that energy coming from the au¬ 
dience.” 

It also helps that the show is 
subject to change, and Silver’s suc¬ 
cessors are always on the look out 
for something in the news that 
might find a laugh on stage. “The 
whole cast gets so excited when 
some new scandal breaks,” Ma¬ 
zlow said. “They ask, ‘Can we do 
something on it?”’ Silver had a 
heyday in the early ’90s with bits 
about Tonya Harding and Nancy 
Kerrigan, Joey Buttafucco and 
Amy Fisher, and the Bobbitts. 
“Thank God for the whole Clin¬ 
ton thing,” Mazlow said. “That 
gave us a year. It’s almost run its 
course, so we’re waiting for an¬ 
other good scandal.” 

Snow job 

The show continues to use the 
basic framework of Snow White’s 
search for her prince, and a lot of 
the material remains as Silver cre¬ 
ated it. That’s true of Babylon vet¬ 
eran Val Diamond’s characters, and 


Twenty-Nine 

Effeminate Gestures 

Doris in a Dustbowl 


Gender Heroes-Part One 


(world premiere) 


such familiar figures as Mr. Peanut, 
a disco-era John Travolta, the 
prancing poodles, and King Louis. 

King Louis is one of Mazlow’s 
signature characters, though as 
his artistic duties have increased, 
he’s been spending more time off¬ 
stage. His outlandish take on Bar¬ 
bra Streisand was another of his 
characters, and it helped get him a 
job with Beach Blanket Babylon. 

The native of Winnipeg had 
moved to Toronto at the first 
chance, where he figured he’d 
make his career in the theater. But 
he landed a role in a production 
headed for Las Vegas, and that be¬ 
came his home for the next eight 
years. Ready for a change, he 
moved to Los Angeles and one 
night was cutting up in bar, doing 
his impression of Barbra 
Streisand in Yentl. Steve Silver was 
there, and he asked Mazlow to au¬ 
dition for Beach Blanket Babylon. 

“I felt an amazing connection 
with Steve Silver,” Mazlow said. “I 
was so calm with this person. It 
was like I had always known him. 
He asked me when my birthday 
was, and I said June 7. He said 
that’s the birthday of Beach Blan¬ 
ket Babylon. I believe there are no 
accidents.” 

Mazlow was first cast in a con¬ 
densed Las Vegas version of the 
show, playing Mr. Peanut and Lib- 
erace. “Steve would love to see 
performers on the edge,” he said. 
“He told me one night to go out 
and do my celebrity impressions, 
but he didn’t tell anyone else. And 


..fresh, touching and 

wickedly funny..." 

-The New York Times 


Kenny Mazlow as swishing King Louis in Beach Blanket Babylon 


then I was supposed to fly as Lib- 
erace, but my outfit got hooked 
up on the rig and it looked like 
laundry hanging out to dry. I 
heard him in the audience 
screaming with laughter.” 

Mazlow is now preoccupied 
with the special performance at 
Herbst Theatre, which will in¬ 
clude cameo appearances by Di¬ 
anne Feinstein as Snow White, 
George Shultz as Superman, 
Charlotte Shultz as Wonder 
Woman, Ann Getty as the Pineap¬ 
ple Queen, and Willie Brown as 
himself. Proceeds from that per¬ 
formance will benefit the Young 
Conservatory at American Con¬ 
servatory Theater and the UCSF 


Cancer Center. Performances 
through the rest of June will ben¬ 
efit 24 other Bay Area nonprofit 
organizations. 

The Herbst show will open 
with a tribute to Steve Silver, who 
was ailing but present when a 
similar celebration was held to 
mark the show’s 20th birthday in 
1994. 

“It was amazing to watch him 
deal with his illness,” Mazlow said. 
“He never wanted to give up, and 
we never thought we’d have to 
give him up. We thought of him 
as the Peter Pan of San Francisco. 
People would just follow him be¬ 
cause he made their lives a little 
happier.” ▼

Outing damned spots 


'Dry Cleaning' from France 



Stanislas Merhar 


by Robert Julian 


A dry cleaning operation in a 
small French city seems, at 
first, an unlikely setting for 
a story of tortured desire and sex¬ 
ual obsession. Nicole (Miou- 
Miou) and Jean-Marie (Charles 
Berling) are a married couple who 
live above the cleaners with their 
adolescent son and Jean-Marie’s 
mother, from whom he inherited 
the business. When Loic (Stanis¬ 
las Merhar), a drag performer, 
comes in to have a stain removed 
from his gold lame dress, the hus¬ 
band exclaims upon Loic’s depar¬ 
ture, “Don’t tell me a drag artist is 
like you or me!” The strength of 
Jean-Marie’s objection belies a 
visceral connection between the 
men that will be their undoing. 


Anne Fontaine writes and di¬ 
rects Dry Cleaning with a sure 
hand, extracting finely detailed 
performances from her three lead 
actors. Miou-Miou’s face betrays 
her desperation with life as a 
working wife in a dull marriage, 
in a dull town. Yet beneath her 
disenchantment, there is still a 
spark of hope. Loic inspires 
Nicole to recall that change is al¬ 
ways possible. Stanislas Merhar 
infuses the role of Loic with an 
undeniable masculinity and, at 
the same time, tremendous sexu¬ 
al ambiguity. Nicole’s desperation 
for change, and her sexual frus¬ 
trations, are easily addressed by 
Loic’s attentions, but Jean-Marie, 
the husband, is a tougher case to 
crack. 

Charles Berling’s Jean-Marie is 
a man who never removed him¬ 
self from his mother’s watchful 
eye. He is used to disapproval and 
discipline, not the wild prospect 
of sexual abandon which Loic 
forces him to entertain. Jean- 
Marie’s sexual attraction to Loic is 
so acute, it is almost painful to 
watch, and Berling portrays the 
husband’s dilemma with great 
depth and restraint. 

The wonderful accomplish¬ 
ment of Dry Cleaning is its ability 
to recreate on film the world of a 
small-town French entrepreneur. 
It is a claustrophobic, petty uni¬ 
verse which rivals the exquisite 
hell of Jean-Paul Sartre’s No Exit. 
Although the menage a trois 
which evolves during the course 
of Dry Cleaning lacks the glamour 
of Cabaret or Something for Every¬ 
one, the film rewards through its 
revelation of character and its 
strong sense of place. Fans of 
French cinema will find much to 
admire in this interesting collision 
of personalities. And Stanislas 
Merhar’s performance as the am¬ 
bisexual Loic should resonate 
long after the film has concluded. 
Rarely has an actor, in any lan¬ 
guage, been able to combine 
pathos and sexual pathology in 
such an exceptional fashion. ▼

Lysergic landscapes 

John Maybury's 'Read Only Memory ' 



by Gary Morris 


|| ohn Maybilry, who’s been 

. making experimental films 
since 1982, emigrated to the 
ostensibly commercial world of 
feature films with 1998’s Love Is 
the Devil, the well-regarded story 
of the tortured affair between 
painter Francis Bacon and his 
dizzy, muscular muse George 
Dyer. But that film was hardly a 
typical biopic. The Bacon estate’s 
refusal to cooperate with him was 
only one more reason for May- 
buty to dig into his roomy bag of 
experimental tricks. The result 
was a series of often brilliant ef¬ 
fects, most notably his catty pay¬ 
back to Bacon’s heirs by staging 
numerous scenes in the exact 
manner of Bacon’s bloody, angst- 
ridden paintings. 

However, any fears that the 
film was Maybury’s attempt to “go 
Hollywood” — or even “go Chan¬ 
nel 4” — can be put to rest with 
his more recent works: Maledicta 
Electronica, coming up in the Les¬ 
bian & Gay Film Festival; and 
most strikingly, the sometimes re¬ 
warding, sometimes grueling 
Read Only Memory, a 3+ hour 
video installation making its U.S. 
premiere at the Yerba Buena Cen¬ 
ter. 

Fans of Love Is the Devil will 
recall that film’s hammering use 
of strobe effects, sudden bloody 
faces, curious camera angles, and 
a kind of mythology of the un¬ 
conscious that always threatened 
to overwhelm the tenuous reality 
of Bacon and Dyer’s lives. In Read 
Only Memory, it’s no longer a 
threat; story, characters, and other 
reassuring elements are simply 
obliterated by what appears to be 
Maybury’s quite elaborate private 
mythology, rendered as a visual 
tour-de-force. 

Maybury is always generous in 
his homages (Maledicta Electroni¬ 
ca, for example, is a tribute to 
British wartime code-breaker 
Alan Turing), and Read Only 
Memory is no exception. The 
opening sequence resurrects the 
famous psychedelic split-screen 
light show from 2001, and for 
good reason. As in the Kubrick 
film, this is the trippy intro to a 
fabulously weird, drug-addled 
psychic landscape. Maybury’s 
mindbending tour hits all manner 
of cultural hot buttons: gender 
politics, anticonsumerism, cultur¬ 
al imperialism, AIDS, bizarre 
computer art, trance music and 
imagery — if you can think of it, 
you can probably find it some¬ 
where in here. 

Other objects of Maybury’s 
artistic affections include Ed- 
weard Muybridge, whose famous 
series of frames of horses is re¬ 
called here; The Road Warrior, 
whose homo-inflected character 
the Humungous is vocally 
reprised; J. K. Huysman’s Against 
Nature, a cornerstone novel of 
fin-de-siecle decadence whose 
spirit drives much of the film; and 
of course Andy Warhol, from 
whom Maybury borrows the end¬ 
less repetitions of faces. 

The Fat Controller 

Every trip needs a guide, and 
this one has a spirit-muse in the 
form of a fat, naked woman — or 
was that a post-op tranny? — who 
reappears throughout, gyrating 
across lysergic landscapes to Ara¬ 
bic trance music. Lest it be said 
that Maybury has no sense of 


humor, this character is the height 
of camp. She wears an assortment 
of ornate headdresses and glitter¬ 
ing go-go boots, and her dance is 
far from classical; it’s closer per¬ 
haps to the funky chicken. The 
film’s attempt to re-create an acid 
trip is showcased in this creature’s 
dance: whenever she moves, a 
rainbow of colors and shapes ap¬ 
pear, as if her appendages are the 
artist’s brushes. Those who can’t 
get enough-of this hefty, unpre¬ 
dictable gal will be pleased to see 
her multiplied in one sequence, 
creating all kinds of visual may¬ 
hem with her bumps and grinds. 

Still, Maybury is far from mere 
frivolous campmeister, and much 
of Read Only Memory is pithy cul¬ 
tural criticism. An early extended 
sequence shows a cartoonish 
landscape crowded with a parade 
of consumer objects moving 
through the air as if on invisible 
conveyor belts; a typical such ob¬ 
ject is a bottle of perfume labeled 
“Paranoia.” The director’s color¬ 


fully weird visualizations of these 
images make them work. 

Much of Read Only Memory's 
imagery is downbeat and disturb¬ 
ing, particularly another recur¬ 
ring character seen in strobe- 
drenched half-light, writhing on a 
floor wrapped in ragged ban¬ 
dages. In another scene, a splash 
of blood appears on a face, seen in 
distorted close-up; soon the face 
is covered in blood, a clear refer¬ 
ence to AIDS paranoia. Maybury’s 
punishing use of strobe-edits, dis¬ 
torted angles, and kaleidoscopic 
colors in such sequences is both 
shocking and obscuring, putting 
a bit of breathing room between 
the viewer and the startling im¬ 
agery. Some viewers will appreci¬ 
ate this distance; others will ig¬ 
nore it and simply immerse them¬ 
selves in the images. Still others 
may prefer to sample this chal¬ 
lenging work in bits, which the 
egalitarian Maybury probably 
would not find at all objection¬ 
able. ▼

gests people over 40 really should 
just stay in deep hiding. There’s 
certainly blame enough to go 
around. The fact is, we only really 
learn what to do with youth once 
we’re a tad too old to enjoy it; 
hence the tired — and old — 
axiom, youth is wasted on the 
young. 


Christine Burton says she “did¬ 
n’t really start to live” until she 
turned 80. That’s when her sexi¬ 
ness and joie de vivre really blos¬ 
somed. It was then that Burton re¬ 
ally began to feel free and wanted 
to pass that feeling on to other les¬ 
bians. She started Golden 
Threads, an international corre¬ 
spondence group for older les¬ 
bians which meets annually in 
Provincetown. 

Golden Threads, directed by 
Lucy Winer, airs on PBS’s POV se¬ 
ries June 8. Part documentary, 
part personal narrative, part bio¬ 
graphical vignette, part stop-ac¬ 
tion animation, Golden Threads 
raises many questions about the 
role of aging in lesbian lives, using 
the 90-year-old Burton and her 
work as nexus for the narrative. 

Those looking for polished, 
fluid filmmaking may dislike 
Winer’s low-budget and amateur¬ 
ish style, but Burton is marvelous 
and Winer’s subject matter com¬ 
pelling enough to ease the dis¬ 
gruntled formalist through what 
evolves into a very worthwhile, 
engaging and historic hour. 

Winer introduces the viewer to 
Burton at the ninth anniversary of 
Golden Threads, where she is 
clearly the commander-in-chief 
of hundreds of dykes. Dressed in 
lavender and purple, sporting a 
host of protest buttons and talk¬ 
ing the kind of in-your-face dyke 
talk one associates with twen- 
tysomethings, Burton has a lacon¬ 
ic charm that pulls the viewer in. 
What surprises most is how 
youthfufshe seems; this is not the 
old lady your grandmother was. 

The Golden Threads women 
are strikingly ordinary — they 
could be anybody’s mother or 
grandmother at the beach. It is 
only when they begin to talk that 
they are revealed as lesbians. 
Some are coupled, others are hop¬ 
ing to meet a nice single gal at the 
event; some look in their 40s, oth¬ 
ers much older, though nearly 
everyone has gray hair. Ruth Ellis,

Christine Burton in Lucy Winer's Golden Threads 


a,trim, black butch who plays 
pool like the sharks in Gwendolyn 
Brooks’ poem, is closing in on 97. 
One woman in her late 50s talks 
about meeting her new love 
through Golden Threads. She 
wasn’t interested at first — 70 
seemed too old to her, but she was 
intrigued by two things. The new 
woman had been in her previous 
relationship for 41 years (the lover 
had died) and indicated she still 
had a strong libido. 

This kind of myth-busting is at 
the heart of Golden Threads. 
Women don’t just shrivel up and 
blow away after menopause; they 
are still intensely vital, as these 
women show. And they have a 
tremendous amount of history to 
share, but don’t — as one woman 
notes — want to be viewed sim¬ 
ply as historic monuments no 
longer alive. Burton tells of re¬ 
ceiving a letter from one woman 
who had considered suicide be¬ 
fore finding Golden Threads — 
she was that isolated. Burton 
states declaratively, “It’s terrible 
what society does to women who 
are aging” — and how that makes 
every woman fear old age. 

Mrs. Goodwrench 

Sadly, Burton had a massive 
stroke less than 24 hours after leav¬ 
ing the weekend retreat. The final 
segment of Golden Threads takes 
us to the nursing home where she 
struggles to regain speech and 
some mobility. Just as out and fla¬ 


grantly lesbian as she was at her all¬ 
girl retreat in Gaytown USA, she 
knocks some of the nursing home 
staff for a loop. In one scene, the 
speech therapist shows Burton pic¬ 
tures; she is expected to describe 
what she sees. At a picture of a man 
changing a car tire while a woman 
watches, Burton tries to explain 
that the woman should be chang¬ 
ing the tire; the speech therapist is 
not amused. 

Winer inserts animated bits 
about herself and her perspective 
on aging — and on having fun — 
(she doesn’t like either) into the 
text. These don’t really work. The 
choppy editing also gets tiresome 
after a while. What is maddening 

— to filmmaker and viewer alike 

— is that Burton’s stroke puts an 
end to discourse. Winer tells us in 
voiceover all the things she had 
hoped to ask Burton after the 
Golden Threads retreat — history 
she’ll never record because the 
stroke stole too much of Burton 
away. Which points to the impor¬ 
tance of recording our oral histo¬ 
ries now, while there’s still time. 
(Is Winer contacting Ruth Ellis for 
a documentary on her? What she 
must have seen in her 97 years!) 

Golden Threads is a conscious¬ 
ness-raiser for anyone planning to 
live past 40. The film also makes 
one think about how out we will 
be able to be in retirement villages 
and nursing homes. Uneven 
though it may be, Golden Threads 
is a must-see. T 



Take it to the streets 


I t’s a good weekend for street theater, as the 5th Annual San Fran¬ 
cisco Street Theater Festival, In The Street, hits several locations 
around town. Daytime performances (Sat. 8c Sun., June 5-6,12- 
5 p.m.) are in Cohen Alley, in the 500 block of Ellis St. between 
Leavenworth and Hyde. This year’s “roving evening performance”, 
on Friday, June 5,8-10:30 p.m., will be at Duboce Park on Steiner 
Street. Performers include Sister Spit, Steamroller, and Nao Busta¬ 
mante. The festival, sponsored by the Tenderloin’s 509 Cultural 
Center/ Luggage Store and Wise Fool Community Arts, is free of 
admission. Info at 255-5971. Y

backs. Everyone seems to be 
having a fabulous time, but one 
man doesn’t get up from his flip. 
He is folded into the mat and 
taken away. What could echo 
more deeply the recent concern 
for the number of bikers killed or 
injured on San Francisco streets? 
The silence and the reverent, yet 
uncomprehending looks by 
which the performers acknowl¬ 
edge the scene of the accident are 
chilling. 

Richard Board provided light¬ 
ing that was appropriately dra¬ 
matic, yet subtle at times. On the 
other hand, Gary Lutes’ sound 
design sometimes was a bit over¬ 
done. Maybe just the volume 
needs adjusting, but one scene I 
had found so touching in the pre¬ 
view, Jessica Lutes riding with 
Benney on the handlebars, 
seemed to lose its tenderness 
when a electronic ambient buzz 
was added. 

Another significant change is 
in the cast. Now missing is a bike 


messenger named Junior, who 
had impressed me so much the 
first time around that I spoke with 
him after the show. He was a mid¬ 
dle-aged man with a long beard 
and hair to match, who had been 
a bike messenger for two decades. 
He appeared the antithesis of the 
stereotypical bike messenger: 
young, lean, athletic, energetic. He 
was like the eye of a hurricane, 
calm in the midst of the whirl¬ 
wind of traffic around him. He 
provided a necessary foil, and a 
ballast. 

A few months ago, when I ran 
out of my office to feed my park¬ 
ing meter, I found him on the 
sidewalk and asked him if he 
would be in the upcoming per¬ 
formance of Freewheel. He said 
that it had been interesting, but 
he didn’t know if he would do it 
again. He floated off down Bat¬ 
tery Street, and I thought he was 
definitely a person who seemed 
devoid of the craving for that

fame. Even if he would not recre¬ 
ate his role, the part should have 
been assumed by one of the 
dancers, as it provided an impor¬ 
tant balance •point, a demonstra¬ 


tion of Zen and the Art of Bike 
Messengering. Even when life 
doesn’t cooperate, the beauty of 
the theater is that you can create 
the illusion that it does. T

Round and round again 

OnSite Dance Co/s 1 Freewheel' at YBC 


by Aimee Ts’ao 


I loved OnSite Dance Compa- 
: ny’s Freewheel while it was still 
m germinating back in Decem¬ 
ber, and though I enjoyed the fin¬ 
ished product at the Yerba Buena 
Center for the Arts Forum last 
weekend, I wish I could say that I 
liked the end result better than 
the work-in-progress. The truth 
is that it didn’t move me nearly as 
much the second time around. 
Maybe it’s just like relationships 
with people: when you first meet, 
the excitement of discovery, the 
intoxication of possibility clouds 
your view of the potential under¬ 
lying conflicts. But you work 
through those issues, and while 
the resulting “marriage’^is based 
on love, trust, and caring, the 
glamour is gone. 

Freewheel came out of a Wattis 
Artist-in-Residence grant that al¬ 
lowed OnSite directors Jessica 
Lutes and Paul Benney to devel¬ 
op new work during a three-week 
period last fall. The Center for the 
Arts Gallery had an exhibition on 
bicycle culture on display at the 
time, and it inspired the two 
choreographers to explore a 
world new to them. The week be¬ 
fore the preview, I had seen the 
National Acrobats of China, who 
astounded with an entire section 
of bicycle riding, including bal¬ 
ancing a dozen performers on a 
single two-wheeler. Since there 
was no way OnSite could begin to 
reach that level of technical ex¬ 
pertise, I focused on what the 
work was showing about the 
community of bike messengers, 
and cycling in general. 

Many elements of OnSite’s 
work contribute to the creation of 
a very successful piece of theater. 
The cast includes dancers, kids, 
real bike messengers, a musician. 
The bicyclists ride around the 
perimeter of the Forum, sur¬ 
rounding the audience with their 
nearly silent speed and graceful 
motion, immediately including 
everyone in the space. Window 
shades at the back of the space 
rise to reveal half a dozen cyclists 
weaving in and out on the ter¬ 
raced gardens outside. The soft 
glow of the streetlamps and the 
bikes’ headlights, seen through 
the mesh screens still over the 
windows, evoke a dream quality, 
and completely blur the border 
between the performance and the 
outside world. The bike messen¬ 
gers rap on the window and are 
admitted by a security guard who 
even signs for their packages. As 
the piece continues, we see inno¬ 
cent bystanders walk by and 
watch through the windows, and 
realize that they, too, are an inte¬ 
gral part of the performance. 

Slo-mo crash 

While OnSite’s tone is largely 
playful, horsing around with lots 
of running, jumping and riding, 
one significant addition since the 
preview brings into focus the 
dangers inherent in riding in a 
dense urban environment. In the 
middle of the performance, there 
is a slow-motion collision. A bi¬ 
cycle goes up in the air, and its 
rider is made to rotate by many 
hands in the background. She 
lands on her feet but is visibly 
shaken, though glad to be safe. 
Later, the dancers ride their bikes 
into the end of a very thick blue 
gym mat, somersault over their 
handlebars, and land on their 


Medicare and most insurance accepted.

38 BAY AREA REPORTER 3 June 1999 






A scene from Jonathan D. Gift's Valhalla, screening at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. 


bright idea of putting on The Ring 
in his living room, not quite as 
difficult as it might seem if you 
lip-synch to a recording, use Hol¬ 
lywood connections for props and 
special effects, and hire a muscle- 
bound Malibu surfer to play 
Siegfried. 

You have to know the Ring well 
in order to get the in-jokes and 
follow this severely truncated ver¬ 
sion of the four operas, but Val¬ 
halla is genuinely affecting, and 
some of the staging is more magi¬ 
cal than anything you’ll ever see in 
a mere opera house. Sponsored by 
the Wagner Society of Northern 
California, Valhalla screens at 
Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, 
June 11 and July 2. Order tickets 
from www.wagnersf.org, or con¬ 
tact the producers for copies of the 
video at www.HurricaneC.com. 

Live Performances — On 
July 4 at 2 p.m., the San Francisco 
Opera orchestra, chorus and 
soloists Frances Ginzer 
(Briinnhilde), Marjana Lipovsek 
(Fricka), George Gray (Siegfried) 
and Tom Fox (Alberich) will pre¬ 
sent highlights from the Ring 
under the baton of Donald Run- 
nicies at Stern Grove (19th and 
Sloat), in a concert whose biggest 
inducement is that it is free. Bring 
your own potato salad. 

But what if you hate Wagner, 
that old anti-Semite (though 
you’d have loved his velvet wall 
hangings and silk underwear)? 
You can still get in on the fun by 
hearing The Merry Nibelungs, a 
rude Ring burlesque by Oscar 
Straus, composer of The Choco¬ 
late Soldier (ah, Nelson Eddy!). 
Comic tenor Ross Halper offers a 


new “R”-rated translation of the 
1904 operetta. Fully staged by the 
Opera Ensemble of San Francis¬ 
co, Merry Nibelungs plays at The 
7th Note showclub (915 Colum¬ 
bus at Lombard) on June 14, 17, 
20,21 and 27 at 8 p.m. Call (415) 
431-1823 for tickets. 

Reading about the Ring — 
The only real way to understand 
Wagner is to listen to it live, 
though recordings will do in a 
pinch. The next best alternative is 
reading about it. More books have 
been written about Wagner than 
about any other historical figure 
save Napoleon and Jesus Christ, 
but many Wagnerian tomes are 
contentious, overly scholarly or 
just plain tedious. For the com¬ 
plete Wagnerian virgin, the best 
intro I’ve found is Wagner With¬ 
out Fear (Vintage Original, 1998, 
$15) by William Berger, who 
worked at SFO. Full of factoids, 
opinions and spot-on analysis, 
Berger’s book not only is infor¬ 
mative and funny, but remarkably 
free of prejudice and received 
opinion. 

Wagner as vegetarian, Wagner 
as lover, Wagner as crank, Wagner 
as proto-Nazi, Berger covers it all. 
Read this book twice and you can 
hold your own with those opera 
lobby bores who laydown the law 
without having any evidence ex¬ 
cept years of swallowing Gramo¬ 
phone's chauvinistic critics whole. 
Berger agrees with me and B.A.R. 
critic Tim Pfaff that Karajan’s 
recording of the Ring (DG Origi¬ 
nals), whatever its vocal deficien¬ 
cies, is orchestrally in a class by it¬ 
self. Berger says simply: “No one 
else has ever come close to Kara¬ 


jan and the Berlin Philharmonic.” 
Amen. 

Finally, the long out-of-print 
graphic novel of The Ring (DC 
Comics, 1991, $24.95) has been 
reprinted by a Wagner-loving 
publisher in El Cerrito. It is drawn 
by master artist Gil Kane and dra¬ 
matized by Roy Thomas, who told 
me that he listened to the Solti 
recording over and over until 
Wagner’s rhythms were printed in 
his brain. (And that’s all Solti is 
good for; if you want Birgit Nils¬ 
son’s Briinnhilde, get Karl Bohm’s 
live recording from Bayreuth on 
Philips.) This explains why, if you 
know the score, you can hear the 
music as you read Thomas’ dia¬ 
logue. 

As for Kane’s anti-gravity 
comic book art, wouldn’t you kill 
to see a Ring look like this on 
stage, with pneumatic sex kittens 
and pumped-up heroes every bit 
as pop-erotic and brainless as 
Wagner’s own characters? Be 
warned, however, Kane’s villains 
are part of that persistent Aryan 
fantasy — just redemonstrated in 
the new Star Wars movie — in 
which, as critic Anthony Lane bit¬ 
terly reminds us, “The threat of 
the malformed and rapacious is 
regularly defused by a body of tall 
white knights.” 

No, it is not pretty or multi- 
culti, but it is genuine Wagner. I 
suspect the composer would have 
loved DC Comics. The Ring 
graphic novel is available at the 
Opera House gift shop, or by mail 
from ExPress (1-800-307-0789). 
So you didn’t score Ring tickets? 
Be cool; you’re gonna have a good 
time anyway. T

ets at all? Ring cycles are such 
mega-events in the opera world 
these days — think of it as Star 
Wars with better music — that 
tickets are hard to come by in the 
best of circumstances. I am told, 
however, that SFO’s cycle three — 
June 20-29, featuring a relatively 
young and unknown cast, which 
in this case may be a good thing 
— still has a couple of hundred 
unsold seats. (Contact the SFO 
box office at (415) 864-3330.) 

What if you can’t afford live 
opera and still want your Wagner 
fix? After all, once the thing gets 
rolling, if you don’t know who 
Wotan, Erda and Jane Eaglen are, 
you might feel as left out around 
the water cooler as the guy who 
isn’t conversant with Jar Jar Binks’ 
Jamaican accent or Queen Ami- 
dala’s Kabuki frocks. So here is a 
pop culture guide to getting a 
Ring fix without actually having 
to enter the goldly-gleaming War 
Memorial and sit through 15-16 
hours of German music. 

Video — Hey, if you are not at 
Rheingold on June 9, be sure to tune 
in to KQED at 8 p.m. for Sing 
Faster, winner of the Sundance 
Filmmakers’ Trophy. This hour- 
long documentary by Jon Else 
should be required viewing for all 
disgruntled operagoers, especially 
critics. It demonstrates how the 
complicated art of opera is sup¬ 
ported by the blood, sweat and 
straining quadriceps of those hard¬ 
working, backstage union crews. 
Filmed during dress rehearsals, 
amidst smoke, dust, stygian gloom 
and the pressure of deadlines — 
thus the film’s ironic title — these 
unsung heroes muscle the sets into 
place, scream about the lighting 
and sound cues, and generally be¬ 
have like lifeguards or firemen. The 
show would not go on without 
them, and the fact that nobody gets 
decapitated in all that chaos is a 
miracle. At one point, the director 
photographs the rapturous, up¬ 
turned faces of the stagehands, and 
we think, “Ah, they are getting cul¬ 
ture.” Nope. They’re watching the 
NBA playoffs on backstage TV. 
This film is better than laughing 
gas. 

Another multiple film festival 
winner is Valhalla, a full-length 
fiction movie, written and direct¬ 
ed by Jonathan D. Gift in 1992. 
Low budget and unassuming, al¬

Seth speaks 


by Tim Pfaff 


An Equal Music by Vikram Seth; 
Broadway Books, $25 

11 If ovelists take music as their 
subject at their peril. The 
1 problems are simple and 
largely unsolvable. Music itself 
operates outside the sphere of in¬ 
fluence of any words used to de¬ 
scribe or analyze it. And it is, by its 
very nature, evanescent; like a 
good waiter, it disappears as soon 
as it has done its work. Strictly 
speaking, it lasts only as long as its 
sound takes to decay. 

So most novels about music 
are either philosophical — What’s 
It All About, Alfie? — or psycho¬ 
logical, focusing on the behavior 
and character of musicians and 
composers. A classic of the first 
type is E.M. Forster’s Howards 
End, a splendid novel except when 
it addresses musical classics and 
what they “mean,” at which point 
it descends to the purple prose of 
early-LP liner notes. A latter-day 
example of the second type is 
David Leavitt’s The Page Turner 

— which, in the first place, isn’t 
(it’s a turgid, disagreeable read) 
and, in the second, seldom moves 
beyond an examination of the an¬ 
nihilating narcissism of the star 
musician. 

Vikram Seth’s new novel, An 
Equal Music, comes as a welcome 
antidote to both of those literary 
tendencies — and strikes me as 
the first novel about music that 
gets it right and also succeeds on 
its own terms, as viable, com¬ 
pelling piece of fiction. When I 
finished it, I had the same regret I 
had at the end of Seth’s last novel, 
the monumental A Suitable Boy 

— namely, that I’d never be able 
to read it for the first time again. 
Seth’s that rarest of contemporary 
novelists, an adept, sensitive sto¬ 
ryteller whose primary aim is to 
envelop his readers in a story, 
make them care about its charac¬ 


ters, startle them with twists of 
plot and leave them, in the home 
stretch, unable to stop reading 
while simultaneously wishing the 
story could go on forever. He is, 
for my money, the best 19th-cen¬ 
tury novelist writing in the 20th. 

The central characters of An 
Equal Music are string players, 
members of the cunningly named 
Maggiore Quartet (the name 
means “major,” as in musical key, 
but also has promotional implica¬ 
tions so savvy that it’s amazing 
there isn’t an ensemble so 
named). The subsidiary cast in¬ 
cludes some vividly depicted 
music paraprofessionals, critics, 
agents, managers and concert 
promoters. 

All will be immediately recog¬ 
nizable, and believable, to anyone 
familiar with the art, and the biz. 
There’s a particularly delicious 
moment early on, at the bitchy, 
annual pre-Christmas party of the 
morally compromised music crit¬ 
ic Nicholas Spare. While making 
salacious passes at the Maggiore’s 
gay first violinist, Piers, and its 
straight second, Michael Holme, 
the novel’s narrator-protagonist 
Spare muses acidly on the matter 
of the quartet’s rise to fame. 
“There are two mafias in music,” 
the Maggiore’s agent, Erica 
Cowan, responds witheringly, 
“the Jewish mafia and the gay 
mafia, and Piers and I between us 
have both bases covered.” 

Your home is 
a concert hall 

The music they play is real, 
too, and Seth renders both music 
and playing in a way that drove 
me back to the pieces mentioned. 
As I suspect other music lovers 
may do in the course of reading 
the book (I encourage it), I found 
myself recreating some of the 
Maggiore’s programs at home, lis¬ 
tening to my favorite recordings 
of the music they play in the 
novel.

Ordinary Justice by Trudy 
Labovitz; Spinsters, $12.00 

I ’ve been trying to figure out 
why this first novel by Trudy 
il Labovitz is so unsatisfying. 
The writing is pretty good, the 
characters fairly detailed, the plot 
involves issues like battered 
women, about which I care deeply 
— but the whole was significantly 
less than the sum of its parts. I 
think the problem is that there is 
really nothing at stake in this 
novel. Although there are frequent 
references to dangerous situations 
and threatening strangers, there is 
nevertheless no point at which I 
believed anyone really was in jeop¬ 
ardy — a fatal flaw in a novel that 
purports to be a mystery. 

Zoe Kergulin left her Washing¬

this old house she purchased 
(which is referred to as both

Seth ends his novel on a solo- 
piano performance of Bach’s The 
Art of Fugue. The composer’s tow¬ 
ering (and unfinished) summa, 
the work figures heavily through¬ 
out the novel: as the source of an 
encore at a Maggiore concert at 
London’s Wigmore Hall, as the 
vexatious repertoire (it’s unclear 
what instruments the work was 
composed for, but certainly not 
the modern string quartet) for the 
Maggiore’s first CD for Stratus 
Records (whose A&R Director, 
Ysobel Shingle, is a minor charac¬ 
ter of Dickensian vividness) and 
finally, as the repertoire for the 
Wigmore recital of Julia McNi- 
choll, a pianist who joins the 
Maggiore for a performance of 
Schubert’s “Trout’ Quintet in Vi¬ 
enna, and, more central to the 
book, Michael’s long-lost and 
temporarily regained love. 

I can’t help wondering if the 
character of Julia was not in¬ 
spired, at least in part, by my own 
favorite real-life pianist, Britain’s 
Joanna MacGregor. In any case, 
An Equal Music impelled me back 
to MacGregor’s haunting record¬ 
ing of The Art of Fugue (which ap¬ 
peared while Seth, an avid follow¬ 
er of the scene, was writing his 
novel), which I now can’t stop lis¬ 
tening to. 

In his recent appearance at the 
Herbst Theatre, Seth allowed that 
his research for the novel included 
interviewing numerous promi¬ 
nent musicians and attending, at 



Vikram Seth 


their invitation, rehearsals of 
major string quartets. It shows. 
The musicians of An Equal Music 
act and talk like musicians, and 
the book’s rehearsals and concerts 
feel like rehearsals and concerts. 
This is a major achievement. 

Even better, Seth seizes upon 
situations a musician or educated 
music-lover would understand — 
the search for a rare recording, the 
anxieties of instrument owner¬ 
ship, the agonies of instrument 
auctions — and uses them for 
pivotal plot points. In these mo¬ 
ments the writing builds levels of 
tension I found nearly unen¬ 
durable. 

But best of all — and the most 
deeply musical aspect of the novel 
— are the rhythm, song and line 
of the prose itself. There’s a kind 
of lapidary perfection about the 
writing that goes far beyond fussi¬ 
ness or mannerism to achieve a 


poise, balance and clarity of ex¬ 
pression one finds in the boldest 
yet most carefully wrought op¬ 
eras. This feels to me like Seth’s 
Lulu, or in current terms, his Pow¬ 
der Her Face. It unfolds with an 
inexorable rhythm across a sus¬ 
tained narrative line without a 
single false note or misstep, nar¬ 
rative or tonal. I’d no more 
change a word of it than a note of 
any of the classical quartets it cel¬ 
ebrates. 

And after all that, An Equal 
Music has the courage to be a 
good read. This is, more than a 
saga about musical life at the end 
of the century, a love story, and a 
wrenching one at that, hotly nar¬ 
rated yet coolly observed. The 
characters are deftly drawn and 
utterly believable in their 
strengths and foibles, and like 
their counterparts in great operas, 
they speak Seth’s music in accents 
all their own. 

The daffy old book world is 
clucking about Seth’s “misfor¬ 
tune” at having a novel about 
music published virtually simul¬ 
taneously with Salman Rushdie’s 
The Ground Beneath Her Feet, a 
retelling of the Orpheus myth in 
rock-music terms. That the day’s 
two best Indian-born writers, 
major cosmopolitans both and 
masters of their craft, should have 
written books about music at 
roughly the same time seems in¬ 
stead a cause for wonder — and 
rejoicing. T

The World and Other Places by 
Jeanette Winterson; Knopf, $22 

| M afka once wrote, “A book 
must be the axe for the 
I. frozen sea inside us.” The 
fictions that live up to this chal¬ 
lenge, the books that move us, in¬ 
variably do so by unlocking what 
. is deeply familiar to us in a way 
that seems new, lyrical and unfor¬ 
gettable. In her previous books, 
such as Oranges Are Not the Only 
Fruit, Written on the Body, and 
Sexing the Cherry, 

Jeanette Winterson 
demonstrated an im¬ 
mense gift for creating 
such “axes.” Her prose 
is poetic, her storylines 
are magical, and her 
continuing explorations 
of gender, identity and 
eroticism are lively and 
fascinating. 

Winterson’s latest 
book, a collection of short 
stories entitled The World 
and Other Places, lives up 
to the promise of her pre¬ 
vious books, and lives up 
to its title by taking its 
readers on excursions into 
territories that are both fa¬ 
miliar and fantastic. The 
most curious and attractive 
quality of Winterson’s fiction 
is her ability to turn everyday 
events into something magi¬ 
cal and otherworldly; her jux¬ 
taposition of actions and im¬ 
ages is such that we know we 
are in a world alive with possibil¬ 
ity. She begins her story “Lives of 
Saints,” for example, with the fol¬ 
lowing sentence: “That day we 
saw three Jews in full length black 
coats and black hats standing on 
identical stools, looking into the 
funnel of a pasta machine.” One 
wants to savor the turn of every 
corner within Winterson’s stories 
because there seem to be surpris¬ 
es around each one. 

The stories in this collection, 
Winterson’s first, represent her

entire career, so those 
who have enjoyed 
her novels will ap¬ 
preciate this oppor¬ 
tunity to see her in 
various lights. This is 
not to say that the 
pieces collected here 
are all that divergent, 
or that they vary in 
quality; Winterson is 
admirably consistent 
in her craft, and 
clearly in control of 
creating her unique¬ 
ly fanciful world. 


Jeanette Winterson 


Dog love 

One of Winterson’s favorite 
themes is that of love, intimacy 
and the geography of connection. 
In the first story in the collection, 
“The 24-Hour Dog,” she explores 
the mysterious intimacy between 
human beings and animals. It’s a 
lyrical, almost sensual portrait of 
a rural woman’s relationship with 
her new dog, a relationship that in 
many ways stupefies and chal¬ 
lenges her. In a refrain that Win¬ 
terson uses throughout the story, 
the narrator tells herself, “He’s only 
a dog. Yes, but he will find me out.” 

Winterson explores intimacy 
of a more human kind in a variety 
of other stories in the collection. 
In “Atlantic Crossing,” she tells the 
tale of a lonely businessman on an 
ocean liner who falls in love with a 
woman named Gabriel. In “Lives 
of Saints,” Winterson presents a 
charming story of two women 
who meet by chance, share a kind 
of eccentric love affair and coexis¬ 
tence, and then drift apart again. 
Winterson has the talent for ren¬ 
dering these disparate voices rich¬ 
ly and believably. 

There are several “flights of 
fancy” in The World and Other 
Places. In “Orion,” for example, 
Winterson retells the lives of 
Orion and Artemis and others in 
a beautifully poetic narrative. 
“The Three Friends,” another ex¬ 


ample, is a very short fable 
about three friends who 
travel the world in search of 
“that which cannot be 
found.” It’s one of Winter¬ 
son’s more mysterious 
pieces, but the imagery is so 
beautiful, and Winterson is 
so captivating as a story¬ 
teller, that one simply has 
to stick with her. Even 
Winterson’s more accessi¬ 
ble stories exhibit a kind 
of Twilight Zone twist. In 
“O’Brien’s First Christmas,” a 
young woman is visited by a 
Christmas fairy, is granted a wish, 
and finds true love. Winterson 
avoids all the possible corniness of 
such an arrangement and turns it 
into an engaging, even sweet hol¬ 
iday tale. 

Reading Winterson’s fiction, 
one is reminded of the “magic re¬ 
alism” of Julio Cortazar, Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez and others. Any¬ 
thing can happen, and it usually 
happens in a very beautiful and 
enchanting way. But Winterson 
can take us there from even the 
most common venues. The story 
that titles the collection, “The 
World and Other Places,” con¬ 
cerns the plight of a young airman 
who is suddenly afflicted with a 
kind of existential crisis. In one 
passage he sits in a dismal hotel 
room and thinks: “In the darkness 
and the silence I can hear, far 
below, the matter of life continu¬ 
ing without me. The night-shift. 
What are they doing, these people 
who come and go, cleaning, 
bringing food, wanting money, 
wanting to fight? What will they 
eat? Where will they sleep? Do 
they love someone? How many of 
them will see morning? Will I?” In 
the districts of Winterson’s fiction 
these questions are posed regular¬ 
ly, and poignantly. And they are 
explored with a beauty and a mys¬ 
tery that make for fascinating 


Ordinary Justice

clearly in trouble. Zoe blows her 
off, so when Susan turns up miss¬ 
ing and her abusive husband 
turns up dead, Zoe’s guilt requires 
her to search for the missing 
Susan, and to solve, in one unbe¬ 
lievable swoop, the mysteries of 
the dead husband, the abused 
wife, the missing dogs, Dorsey’s 
real name, and the Underground 
Railroad. Huh? 

New writers frequently layer 
on subplots when they should be 


deepening the main plot and 
characters, an error that Labovitz 
is guilty of in spades. She ladles on 
so many subplots that every one 
of them, as well as the main plot, 
is given seriously short shrift. At 
no point do we care what happens 
to the people in Ordinary justice 
because they never ring truly alive 
— we have lots of facts about 
them, but their emotional centers 
remain empty. Suspense is alto¬ 
gether absent. The key word in 
this book’s title is ordinary — 
Labovitz provides a by-the-num- 
bers novel that is so drab it’s life¬ 
less. ▼

Thriller with smarts 


by Deborah Peifer 


Waiting by Frank M. Robinson; 
Forge, $23.95 

f all the literary genres, the 
|| one that gets considerably 

less respect than it deserves 
is the airport book (or as it was 
called in earlier, gentler days, the 
train station book). You know 
what I’m talking about — that 
thriller or mystery that makes the 
seemingly interminable wait in 
the terminus fly by. Good airport 
books are not easy to write, espe¬ 
cially one that fills the time with¬ 
out threatening brain damage. 
Waiting by Frank M. Robinson is 
such a book, and it does consid¬ 


erably more than merely pass the 
time. Waiting is a thriller with 
smarts, and it is a pleasure to rec¬ 
ommend. 

Robinson sets the suspense 
with a powerful opening chapter 
in which a man is terrorized be¬ 
cause he thinks he is being fol¬ 
lowed, even though he never sees 
anyone following him. “It never 
occurs to him that he was being 
herded.” When it occurs to you, I 
guarantee that all the hair on 
your body will stand up in fright. 
The doctor is slaughtered by 
dogs, and his friends meet to dis¬ 
cuss the horrifying events. Our 
reluctant hero, Artie, decides to 
investigate the death, and learns 
the meaning of dread as more 
and more people who had any 


contact with the dead doctor are 
being killed in bizarre and seem¬ 
ingly unrelated incidents. When 
Artie’s wife and son go missing, 
his fear becomes panic. His will¬ 
ingness to risk all to save them 
from this nameless, faceless 
threat provides powerful motiva¬ 
tion. 

Characters are richly detailed, 
and the plot twists are fascinating 
as well as credible in this very fine 
novel. Robinson creates terror in 
everyday settings — there is no 
safe harbor. Waiting is a novel of 
suspense that makes you think 
about the large questions of illu¬ 
sion and reality. What happens to 
your sense of self and its place in 
the world when you learn that 
someone you’ve known all your 


life is nothing like what 
you knew (or thought 
.you knew) she was? 
What does it mean 
when your best friend 
is clearly willing to kill 
you and your family 
for personal advance¬ 
ment? How do you 
fight a threat that is 
both real and invisi¬ 
ble? How do you 
protect yourself 
from everything? 
Read Waiting with 
all the lights on and 
all the doors and 
windows locked, 
not that mere locks 
and lights will save 
you. ▼ 



When in Rome.. 


by Marv. Shaw 


Rubicon by Steven Saylor; St. 
Martin's Press, $23.95 

C rossing the Rubicon has 
come to be a figurative way 
to name making a climac¬ 
tic, irrevocable decision and/or 
action. Its origin could easily 
have been Julius Caesar’s bring¬ 
ing his Gallic legions into Italy, 
crossing the Rubicon River and 
threatening Rome under the 
ruler Pompey in 49 B.C. Civil 
war engulfed the empire, and it 
is \yithin this chaotic time peri¬ 
od that Saylor sets his latest mys¬ 
tery. 

Gordianus the Finder is 
forced to be the detective be¬ 
cause it is in his household’s 
courtyard that the body of Nu- 
merius, the beloved lieutenant of 
Pompey, is found. Pompey 
charges Gordianus, sixtyish and 
semi-retired, with the task of 
discovering the murderer. Gor¬ 
dianus’ appellation is soon ex¬ 
plained when his skill in finding 
concealed, incriminating docu¬ 
ments is displayed. 

The various “Rubicons” Gor¬ 
dianus must cross erupt partly 
out of the circumstances in 
which he must guard his own 


and his family’s life, and partly 
out of the actions he must take 
for his own honor. 

Saylor, a classically educated 
historian, has immersed himself 
in the life of ancient Rome and 
brings it vividly to life. He cre¬ 
ates both historical and fictional 
people in this complex tale of 
loyalties, betrayals, intrigue, and 
violence in a frightened city, the 
south Italian countryside, and 
the strategic port city of Brundi- 
sium (present-day Brindisi) at 
the heel of Italy. The atmos¬ 
pheres and locations, from the 
impressive Forum to the sala¬ 
cious Tavern, are evoked strong¬ 
ly. Six previous mysteries in this 
Roma sub Rosa series have pre¬ 
pared the author well. 

The other characters are 
limned very realistically. Cicero 
keeps his literary dignity, while 
at the same time showing how he 
must weave and dodge as an in¬ 
tended statesman who tries to be 
a senator. Cicero’s secretary, Tiro, 
is part of the time the Alexandri¬ 
an philosopher Soscarades, mas¬ 
ter of intrigue. 

Behind all the macho bluster, 
Meto, reputed to be the loving 
tentmate of Caesar’s, struggles to 
stay loyal to his father Gordianus 
and to keep his station as an in¬ 
timate of Caesar’s.

The story mounts to a fiery 
climax in and near the harbor of 
Brindisium as the forces of Pom¬ 
pey and Caesar clash. The reve¬ 
lation of Numerius’ murderer 
makes the reader aware of how 
much Gordianus will do to pro¬ 
tect those he loves. 

The novel, and all that it tells 
us of people in the maelstrom of 
political and military civil strife, 
seem universal when compared 
to similar situations and people 
today. Rubicon has the distinc¬ 
tion of being living history and a 
mirror of our own day. ▼

Miro — but our visit to the bull- 
ring. We were in Madrid for the 
San Isidro festival, which in- 


Manuel Jesus "El Cid" Sala 


The excitable crowd at our 
bullfight waved white handker¬ 
chiefs, a big honor, for the mata¬ 
dor Manuel Jesus “El Cid” 
Sala, and threw flowers at his feet. 
We would have thrown down our 
hotel keys if we thought there were 
a chance he’d take them. He knelt 
down in front of the bull, flirted 
with him, swiveled his sexy hips. 
Need we even mention his skin¬ 
tight outfit? A matador’s “suit of 
lights” is about as many sequins 
and sparkles a man can have on 
him and still look like a man. 

We stayed at a small hotel in 
Chueca, the “gay zone,” which for 
most of its life had been a brothel 
where famous matadors hung up 
their capes. Mussolini’s son-in- 
law rented the whole place for 
three days in ’41 — talk about tea 
with II Duce. We went to the 
Madrid Eagle and thought, if only 
perpetual leather scribe Mr. Mar¬ 
cus could see us now! The dress 
code at the bar was leather, rubber 
or Levi’s; the dress code in the 
backroom was minimum. A bear 
waddled up to the bar and asked 
(in English), “Where’s the men’s 
room?” The bartender did a pass¬ 
able imitation of the Ugly Ameri¬ 
can. 

Never the accidental tourist, 
we researched our trip before we 
went to the municipal pools in the 
Casa del Campo park. Our guide¬ 
book said we would recognize the 
gay section, and as we came upon 
the row of sun-worshipping men 
in tiny European swimsuits and 
big muscles, we knew we had 
found it. There was almost no- 
one actually in the pool, though 
lap-swimmers were stroking away 
indoors, and there did seem to be 
a lot of men watching. The water 
was refreshingly cold under the 
hot Madrid sun, and we could 
wash off the chlorine at outdoor 
showers or inside the vestiduras 
masculines. 

In travel as in sex, context is 
everything, and we’d like our con¬ 
text to be Espana another day. 
Even though we are not the type 
of boy who pees in the shower, we 
did enjoy pissing in the bidet. V 


Out There 

<4 page 30 

No doze 

Is Madrid an entire city of in¬ 
somniacs? After a full night of 
strolling, tapas and (if you’re 
lucky) dinner, the bars don’t get 
going until midnight, pick up by 
2 or 3, and go on all night. No¬ 
body seems to be up in the morn¬ 
ing, when there’s a cool breeze in 
from the mountains. By midday 
the sun is blazing, and it’s time for 
a siesta. 

We know it’s not going to en¬ 
dear us to the animal rights ac¬ 
tivists, but the highlight of our 
visit to Madrid was not our time 
in the incredible trio of art muse¬ 
ums — the Prado, the Reina 
Sofia, and the Museo Thyssen- 
Bornemisza, stuffed to the rafters 
with Velazquez, Goya, Picasso, 


eludes a sort of World Series of 
bullfights, every night for a week. 
The corrida is pure, visceral, life- 
and-death spectacle, the ultimate 
in brains vs. brawn. Yes, it’s ex¬ 
ploitative of the bull, but at least 
he is given a proper funeral at the 
end, and not incidentally given 
the royal treatment while he is 
alive. They don’t tell you about 
the picadores' horses, on the other 
hand, who have no choice but to 
get charged and stabbed by the 
fired-up toro and stand there to 
take it like a horse. Even though 
they’re heavily padded, they are 
gored, and they’re blindfolded the 
whole time, too. So there’s a basic 
S/M aspect to the whole affair 
which can be quite lovely.

reveals. “By the end of that, I was 
stuck with no representation — 
and I was fucked up, just drinking 
myself to death.” 

For the next decade or so, 
Smither confesses, he did little ex¬ 
cept drink, and somehow work as 
a building contractor. Then he got 
sober, and started to play guitar 
seriously again. He quit his job, 
and by a stroke of good fortune, a 
few days later he was approached 
by a management agency. “I had¬ 
n’t written more than two songs 
in ten years, so I told them: ‘It’s 
going to take me a little while. 
What I really need to do is play 
gigs constantly for the next 9 
months, and things will start to 
happen.’ I had my fingers crossed 
behind my back,” says Smither 
with a wry laugh. “But I really 
thought that once I was back into 
performing-shape, the songs 
would flow again. And they did.” 

Since then, Smither has gone 
from strength to strength, releas¬ 
ing six acclaimed albums. On his 
latest release, Drive You Home, like 
its predecessor, Small Revelations, 
he’s backed by a tight combo of 
session players from Austin, but in | 


solo performer, but as one of the 
finest roots-based tunesmiths in 
America. His songs are meticu¬ 
lously wrought, with fluid melodic 
structures, clever hooks, and lyrics 
whose simple, direct language is re¬ 
plete with depth and insight (“My 
freedom will be measured/ By the 
length to which I’ll disobey”). 

Having clearly paid his own 
dues to the blues, Smither has 
learned from his past masters the 
value of suggestion and succinct¬ 
ness. “The idea that you have 
three minutes as a songwriter in 
which to say something meaning¬ 
ful and memorable is definitely 
challenging,” he says. “The blues 
provides an example of a rhyth¬ 
mic format for making statements 
that will stick with people. It has 
a kind of internal punctuation 
that, if you handle the lyrics prop¬ 
erly, makes them hard to forget. I 
use that form, and try to fit my 
own perceptions into it.” ▼

Valley Ministry on Fri., June 11 
at 8 p.m. For tickets ($12), call

appropriately, thunderstruck. “I 
just couldn’t believe the sound he 
got,” recalls Smither, calling in 
from Boulder, Colorado. “I 
thought it was two guys playing. I 
was a child of rock ’n’ roll, and 
here was this guy doing it all by 
himself! Acoustic blues had to be 
where rock ’n’ roll came from. 
That’s what really woke me up. It 
was the turning point.” 

As a fledgling musician, 
Smither proceeded to absorb all he 
could from the old country blues- 
men. He was inspired by hearing 
Mississippi John Hurt to develop a 
laid-back, syncopated fingerpick¬ 
ing style and gentle, gravelly vocals. 
Never content just to copy, Smither 
wanted to write and play his own, 
blues-influenced material. After 
finishing school, he moved to 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, to be¬ 
come part of the flourishing 
singer-songwriter scene there. One 
of his neighbors was Bonnie Raitt. 
“We were good friends before ei¬ 
ther one of us had ever made a 
record. In fact, for about two years, 

I didn’t even know she played gui¬ 
tar!” Smither says. 

Jwo of Raitt’s best-known 
songs, “Love Me Like a Man” and 
“I Feel the Same,” were penned by 
Smithers, and she has referred to 
him glowingly as “my Eric Clap¬ 
ton.” Smither himself put out two 
albums in the early ’70s, and 
recorded a third, Honeysuckle 
Dog, with Raitt, Dr. John, and the 
late Lowell George (of Little Feat) 
contributing in the studio. Sadly, 
the album was never released. “It 
got lost in the shuffle during a 
corporate takeover of the label I 
was on [Poppy Records],” Smither 


Bluesman Chris Smither 


concert Smither prefers to play on 
his own. So when the man with 
the blue Alvarez/Yairi guitar ap¬ 
pears in San Francisco at the Noe 
Valley Ministry on Friday, June 
11, he’ll be accompanied only by 
the sound of his boots. “I always 
have them miked, as I discovered 
a long time ago that if I couldn’t 
hear my feet, I couldn’t play,” he 
explains. “And if people couldn’t 
hear it, then half of it was lost.” 

Smither has acquired a growing 
reputation not only as a powerful

Garden frolic 

I t’s spring, and what could be nicer than to honor the season 
with a garden par ty? Imagine yourself in a Renoir painting, sun¬ 
light dappling the grass as you and your friends lounge about 
among shade trees, gaily picnicking, sipping drinks, exposing your¬ 
self to solar rays and letting lots of lovely queer entertainers amuse 
you all day with dances, comedy, poetry and live music. Wouldn’t 
that be the sweet life? 

The place to go for such a treat this weekend will be Yerba Buena 
Gardens. There, on Saturday, June 5, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the ex¬ 
ceptionally vibrant and multifaceted Jon Sims Center for the Per¬ 
forming Arts will be hosting a free “Festival in the Gardens” for all 
to enjoy. Featured on the garden s stage throughout the day will be 
a host of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender performing artists, 
many of whom developed their material while taking part in the 
Sims Centers AIRspace artists-in-residence program. 

“The variety of performers we have here at the Sims Center is 
somewhat staggering," says Lauren Hewitt, director of the nonprofit 
organization that got its start with the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay 
Freedom Band, founded more than 20 years ago by the late, great 
baton-twirling dynamo Jon Sims. 

Hewitt points to a few of the garden-party offerings as typical of 
the Sims Center’s incredibly broad range of artistic undertakings. 
Among the selections are highlights of a new opera, Wuornos, by 
Carla Lucero, Gail Wilson’s City Swing band, classical dance with 
Arabesque Ballet, and gravity-defying gymnastic stunts by Cheer 
San Francisco. 

During the day you’ll also bear rip-roaring old-fashioned jazz 
from the Dixieland Dykes + 3, the hauntingly beautiful songs of 
vocalist and dancer Gabriel Todd, modern jazz with Kathryn Lyle 
and Rob Chavez, folk and blues by Tuffy Eldridge, flamenco danc¬ 
ing with Nemesio Paredes, uplifting march music with the Free¬ 
dom Band, and much foot stomping by the Barbary Coast dog¬ 
gers. Your hosts for all this and much more will be the Sisters of 
Perpetual Indulgence. 

To complete this pretty picture, festival booths offering face 
painting, ethnic foods, crafts, community information and a 
bouncing castle will be hosted by Bethany United Methodist 
Church. 

So if you want to put a little spring in your life this Saturday, 
head down to Yerba Buena Gardens. It’ll be pretty as a picture, you 
and your friends reclining on the grass, entertained by some of the 
funnest, most talented queer artists in the city. ▼

Chicago’s Congress Theatre 
last Sunday night, May 30, 
when Bruce Chopnik — Mr. 
Rocky Mountain Leather — of 
Denver was named International 
Mr. Leather 1999.

Reilly of Long Beach (Mr. Pistons 
Leather) had been named 1st run¬ 
ner-up, while Mike Hargis (Mr. 


San Diego Leather) had been 
named 2nd runner-up. 

The crowd roared its 
approval. The parade of 
pulchritude onstage was 
instrumental in keeping 
the audience in high ex¬ 
pectation throughout; 
the competition was 
very, very tough and 
the judges were sweat¬ 
ing as much as the contestants. 

It wasn’t easy for judges Thom 
Dombkowski, Tony Mills, Tony 


DeBlase, Spencer Bergstedt, 
Don Bastian, Graylin 
Thornton, Fred Katz,

Lipstory lesson 


by Sweet Lips 


' 1 ,,' es, dear readers, it’s true, and 
you can look it up in your 
It history book: Father of our 
Country George Washington had 
two dogs, named Truelove and 
Sweetlips. As you know, your 
mother Sweet Lips goes back quite 
a Way, and Georgey and I were 
very close. He might have 
chopped down that cherry tree, 
but he could get it up again, too. 

Emperor Steve Rauscher wish¬ 
es to remind you all that tickets 
for the fabulous Closet Ball are 
selling like hormone-induced 
hotcakes; call 290-2676 for infor¬ 
mation. Remember, it’s Sat., June 
12 at the Gift Center Pavilion, 888 
Brannan St. Doors open at 7 p.m., 


and show begins promptly at 8 
p.m. 

Moving on to weightier topics, 
those bears at the Lone Star Sa¬ 
loon will be having their “May¬ 
hem” Beverage Benefit on Sun., 
June 6 from 4-8 p.m. 

It’s a busy week¬ 
end, since on Sat., 

June 5, at 1 p.m., 
the Giraffe Video f 
and Chandelier 
Lounge will be having a 
benefit auction 
for David 
“Waggy” 

Wagstaff. Auc¬ 
tion items are urgently needed. A 
special buffet will be catered by 
Dennis (“Teepees and Tapas”) 
Tyler. 

When I look into my special 


Polkstrasse mirror, whom do I see? 
I see that handsome Michael 
Valdez, still on the plank at the 
new Swallow on Polk, and boy, 
don’t they feature some great 
piano entertainment? 
I see the sweetheart of 
all bartenders, Marlow, 
still holding forth at 
Uncle Bert’s Bar in the 
Castro, and still looking 
hot. Sweet Lips, by 
comparison, gets 
hot flashes. 

One last 

word on the 
Closet Ball: 

getcher party trays now! Call chef 
Dennis (“Tabasco ’n’ Tamales”) 
Tyler at 567-8782 by June 10. 
They serve 10 people with ap¬ 
petites as big as Sweet Lips. ▼ 



Mister Marcus

man, Mr. LURE, New York; Kevin 
Powers, Mr. Cell Block/Male Hide 
Leather; Glenn Mlaker, Mr. D.C. 
Eagle; Andrew Sagan, Mr. Wis¬ 
consin Leather; Scott Begg, Mr. 
Chicago Leather; Ken Claude, Mr. 
Texas Leather; William Schindler, 
Mr. Los Angeles Leather; Joshua 
Smith, Mr. Minnesota Leather; 
Dean Ross, Mr. Mid-Atlantic 
Leather and Ottawa-Hull; Maver¬ 
ick Reynolds, Mr. Ohio Valley 
Leather; and Jarrod Doak, Mr. 
Missouri Leather. San Francisco’s 
three entries, Werner Tillinger, BJ 
Cavnor, and Glennon Sutter, were 
among the 20 finalists. Bravo to 
all! 

The emcees, Queen Cougar 
and Frank Nowicki, were glam¬ 
ourously garbed in dazzling, al¬ 
most matching outfits and they 
kept the show moving along with 
clever and fitting repartee during 
the various judging segments. 

Between the judging seg¬ 
ments, Leather Pride Flag creator 
Tony DeBlase was honored for his 
valuable contribution to leather- 
dom, and the dash¬ 
ing Men of Disci¬ 
pline from both the 
Washington, DC 
and San Francisco 
chapters accepted 
the original flag to 
carry and display 
during the DC 
Pride Parade. Their 
precision military 
maneuvering was 
as regimented as 
any honor guard 
you could imagine. 

Later, after a 
stirring speech 
made by former 
IMsL. Jill Carter, a 
collection was 
made from the au¬ 
dience for the 
Leather Archives 8c 
Museum, and the 
auction of a leather 
pride ring which 
was sold for $1,700. 

The grand total col¬ 
lected from the very 
generous audience 
was about $7,000. 

The night be¬ 
fore, Saturday, with 
an all-day pre-judg- 
ing marathon, the 
scoring continued 
with all 52 contes¬ 
tants creating bed¬ 
lam at the 
Plumber’s Union 
Hall in the 
physique scoring 
segment. 


Thirty contestants were inter¬ 
viewed on Saturday and the re¬ 
mainder were interviewed on 
Sunday morning. 

Needless to say, the Congress 
Hotel was, again, the center of 
most interaction. Well-meaning 
suggestions submitted to the 
hotel’s management fell on deaf 
ears or were ignored, so it was 
slow bar service with hefty prices, 
and the same in the Gazebo Din¬ 
ing Room. The IML 2000 contest 
returns to the Congress, but don’t 
kill the messenger! 

The usual weekend marriages 
transpired; I heard of no divorces. 
There were notices prohibiting 
overt sexual activity in the lobby, 
the tea rooms and the stairwells, 
but you know most delegates 
largely ignored the ban. 

On Thursday night, May 27, a 
healthy crowd materialized at the 
world-famous Cell Block to wit¬ 
ness Cain Berlinger’s first effort at 
producing a leather contest. He 
managed (with a lot of help from 
his friends) to enlist eight candi¬ 
dates for the title with Queen 
Cougar and Frank Nowicki doing 
the emcee honors. With an auc¬ 
tion, drawings and the scoring 


segments, it was quick and to the 
point and by 2230, it was over, 
with Ariq Robinson taking the 
title. Thank goodness. Mr. Robin¬ 
son will not disappoint with 
skeletons from a drag queen clos¬ 
et coming to the fore. 

The large influx of people for 
the IML contest and the Great 
Lakes Bears gathering made for a 
very busy weekend in all the bars, 
shops and restaurants. The 3-level 
leather mart boasted some 190 
vendors with a magnificent array 
of leather and related fetish gear, 
jewelry, and even SMMILE had a 
booth touting the Dore Alley Fair 
and the Folsom Street Fair. R.J. 
Chaffin did a magnificent job lay¬ 
ing out the whole thing. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, IML 99 
scored a solid 10. With Brian- 
Mark Conover almost causing the 
whole thing being shut down for 
baring the new tattoos on his bo¬ 
dacious butt in the lobby of the 
host hotel, IML 99 went on with¬ 
out a hitch. Was there any scandal 
you ask? You know the routine. 
This is the “official” report on 
IML. As you all know, IML-Part 
II next week will have the “offi¬ 
cial” dish. Stay tuned. T

52 BAY AREA REPORTER 3 June 1999 



There’s one in every crowd 



by Gregg Shapiro 


0 ands such as Suede, Placebo 
ff*f|. and Culture Club can lay 
i d claim to having at least one 
openly gay or lesbian band mem¬ 
ber. The bands Skunk Anansie, 
Sleater-Kinney, Frogpond, Impe¬ 
rial Teen and Luscious Jackson 
can say the same thing. 

The Hot Rock by Pacific North¬ 
west-based Sleater-Kinney (Kill 
Rock Stars) continues in the same 
vein as the trio’s two previous crit¬ 
ically lauded discs, Call the Doctor 
and Dig Me Out. Carrie Brown- 
stein, Corin Tucker and Janet 
Weiss (the same line-up as Dig Me 
Out) have a sound that is both ref¬ 
erential (I continue to hear strains 
of early ’80s indie punk in their 
songs) and innovative (they 
emerged from the ’90s riot grrrl 
scene). Highlights on this solid 
13-track disc include “Start To¬ 
gether,” “Burn, Don’t Freeze!,” 
“Banned from the End of the 
World,” “Get Up,” “The Size of 
Our Love,” and the spellbinding 
“Don’t Talk Like” and “A Quarter 
To Three.” 


A little bit campier than 
Sleater-Kinney, Imperial Teen fol¬ 
low up their 1996 debut disc Sea¬ 
sick with the equally exuberant 
What Is Not To Love (Slash). As 
openly gay Roddy Bottum sings in 
“Lipstick,” “Why you gotta be so 
proud/I’m the one with lipstick 
on.” And he does it over a slam¬ 
ming beat with electric guitars 
wailing. “Yoo Hoo” wants to be 
this year’s “Song 2” (by Blur), and 
it still could be. Other recom¬ 
mended cuts include “Open Sea¬ 
son,” “Year Of The Tan,” “Hooray,” 
and “Birthday Girl.” There is so 
much to love here. 

On Safe Ride Home (Colum¬ 
bia), Heidi Phillips and the. other 
members of Frogpond could sure 
use some of Sleater-Kinney’s fero¬ 
cious energy or Imperial Teen’s 
sense of fun. As it stands, tracks 
such as “World Crash,” “I Did,” 
“Fighter,” “22,” and “Get Paid” are 
pleasant enough, but it takes more 
than pleasantries to make it in a 
constantly shifting and very un¬ 
predictable major-label world. 
Something tells me Frogpond is a 
live performance/ word-of-mouth 
unit. If that’s the case, then I’ll 


have to reserve final judgment 
until I see them on stage. 

Having already seen Skunk 
Anansie on stage, I find it easy to 
understand why they have built a 
reputation as a band to see. Lead 
vocalist Skin is a sight to behold, 


bouncing around on stage while 
wailing into the microphone. Fol¬ 
lowing the unexpected dance- 
club success of the remixed 
“Weep” from their previous disc 
Stoosh, Skunk Anansie was ready 
to veer off into the new directions 


they’ve taken on Post Orgasmic 
Chill (Virgin). Far more diverse 
than their first two major-label 
discs, Post Orgasmic Chill's dozen 
tracks will take the listener on a 
ride that is the equivalent of a 
musical roller coaster. Power¬ 
house tracks include “Charlie Big 
Potato,” “On My Hotel T.V.,”“The 
Skank Heads,” “You’ll Follow Me 
Down,” and especially the album’s 
centerpieces “Lately,” “Secretly,” 
and “Good Things Don’t Always 
Come To You.” Throughout the 
disc, Skunk Anansie never loses 
their identity, remaining true to 
their original vision. 

On their third full-length disc, 
Electric Honey (Capitol/ Grand 
Royal), Luscious Jackson contin¬ 
ues their explorations into differ¬ 
ent styles of dance music — the 
wonderful “Nervous Break¬ 
through,” “Ladyfingers,” “Chris¬ 
tine,” “Alien Lover,” “Summer 
Daze,” “Country’s A Callin’,” and 
“Space Diva,” propelled by Kate 
Schellenbach’s forceful drum¬ 
ming. “Fantastic Fabulous,” with 
guest vocalist Deborah Harry, is 
the disc’s least electrifying mo¬ 
ment, and is easy to overlook. T 


Loud Family values 


by Gregg Shapiro 


I if I his column celebrates the 
family in all of its various 
II forms, including chosen, bi¬ 
ological, and especially musical. 

The Loud Family, the band, 
takes its name from the seminal 
PBS documentary about a family 
called Loud. On their most recent 
album Days for Days (Alias), The 
Loud Family does occasionally get 
loud, but it’s all in the name of their 
unique pop-rock style. The disc’s 
eighteen tracks alternate between 
instrumental snippets and full- 
fledged songs. Highlights include 
“Deee-Pression,” “Mozart Sonatas,” 
“Businessmen Are Okay,” and the 
eight minute-plus “Sister Sleep.” 

The Lighthouse Family (no re¬ 
lation) creates a subtle dance 
groove, similar to Seal’s, that 
makes sitting still nearly impossi¬ 
ble. It’s especially present on 
“Raincloud,” “Question Of Faith,” 
“High,” “Lifted,” and “Restless.” 
They also have a way with pretty 
ballads, which you can hear on 
“Postcard From Heaven” and 
“Sun In The Night.” 

The real-life sister and brother 
team of Sarah Bettens and Gert 
Bettens front the band K’s Choice. 
K’s Choice had something of a 
major hit a while back with the 
single “Not An Addict.” 

Cocoon Crash (Sony 550/Epic) 
is their follow-up disc, and it’s 
pretty good. Sarah still kind of 
sounds like Amy Ray of the Indi¬ 
go Girls. I’m not sure why K’s 
Choice isn’t bigger than they are 
(read: cult status). 

Lisa Coleman and Wendy 
Melvoin, who used to be a part of 
Prince’s family, have released a 
disc under the moniker Girl 
Brothers (WDM). After releasing 
a handful of discs as Wendy and 
Lisa, it would seem that they (and 
perhaps their fans) were ready for 
something different. Girl Broth¬ 
ers, the band and the album, do 
deliver something different and 
very cool. Co-produced by Tchad 
Blake, Melvoin and Coleman, the 
album has the unique sound qual¬ 
ities we’ve come to expect from 
Wendy and Lisa, as processed by 
Blake’s distinctive touch. High¬ 


lights include “Reaching One,” “I 
Will,” “Love 8c Trouble,” “If I Were 
Brave,” “Let’s Say,” “Jonathan” (for 
Melvoin’s late brother), and their 
cover of “I’ve Got No Strings.” 

Of the five members of The 
Nields, three of them (Katryna, 
Nerissa and David) actually have 
Nields as their last name. The 
other two (drummer Dave Hower 
and guitarist Dave Chalfant, who 
share the same first name), are 
just good sports. A harder-rocking 
(although not that hard) version 
of the Roches, The Nields’ new 
album Play (Zoe/Rounder) is 
every bit as infectious as their pre¬ 
vious one, Gotta Get Over Greta. 
Swell harmonies and tight musi¬ 
cianship gives Play its undeniable 
energy, especially on songs such as 
“Georgia O,” “Snowman” “Last 
Kisses,” “Friday At The Circle K,” 
and “Tomorrowland.” 

A family affair if there ever was 
one, The McGarrigle Hour 
(Rykodisc) by Kate and Anna Mc¬ 
Garrigle (and their extraordinary 
extended family, which includes 
Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou 
Harris, among others) is simply 
amazing. From the opening track, 
written by Kate’s ex-husband 
Loudon Wainwright (he’s also the 
father of their children Rufus and 
Martha, who sang and con¬ 
tributed original songs to the pro¬ 
ject) to the McGarrigle sisters’ 
originals (such as “Talk To Me of 
Mendocino” and “Cool River,” to 
name a few) and the multitude of 
covers in-between (by the likes of 
Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and 
Stephen Foster), this is one of the 
most timeless albums released in 
1998, or any year for that matter. 

Speaking of Loudon Wain¬ 
wright, Attempted Mustache from 
1973 and Unrequited from 1975 
(both on Columbia/Legacy/Com¬ 
mon Chord) are wonderful histo¬ 
ry lessons made that much better 
for the inclusion of previously un¬ 
available bonus tracks. Fans of his 
son Rufus may gain an even better 
understanding of the young 
Wainwright, and should also find 
amusement in the song “Rufus Is 
A Tit Man” (a song about nurs¬ 
ing), which is on Unrequited in 
two versions (one for each breast, 
I guess). ▼
