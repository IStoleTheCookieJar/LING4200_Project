This  paper  deal  with  the  problem  in  speed  controller  for  Indirect  Field 
Oriented  Control  of  Induction  Motor.  The  problem  cause  decrease 
performance  of  Induction  Motor  where  it  widely  used  in  high-performance 
applications.  In  order  decrease  the  fault  of  speed  induction  motor,  Takagi- 
Sugeno  type  Fuzzy  logic  control  is  used  as  the  speed  controller.  For  this, 
a  model  of  indirect  field  oriented  control  of  induction  motor  is  built 
and  simulating  using  MATLAB  simulink.  Secondly,  error  of  speed  and 
derivative  error  as  the  input  and  change  of  torque  command  as  the  output  for 
speed  control  is  applied  in  simulation.  Lastly,  from  the  simulation  result 
overshoot  is  zero  persent,  rise  time  is  0.4s  and  settling  time  is  0.4s.  The 
important  data  is  steady  state  error  is  0.01  percent  show  that  the  speed  can 
follow  reference  speed.  From  that  simulation  result  illustrate  the

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The  three-phase  induction  motors  (IM)  are  very  frequent  used  in  industrial  application,  because  of 
the  simplicity  of  its  implementation,  higher  torque-to-weight  ratio,  higher  reliability,  ruggedness  and  low 
maintenance  requirements,  and  ability  to  operate  in  dangerous  environment[l]-[3].  Because  of  that  the 
performance  of  IM  is  important,  in  order  to  maintantan  IM  performance  one  of  the  couse  is  controlling 
part  [4].  But,  the  coupling  between  torque  and  flux  in  IM  unlike  DC  motor,  their  control  is  a  challenging  task. 
However,  indirect  field  oriented  control  (IFOC)  is  use  to  decouple  between  torque  and  flux  then  can  be 
controlling  separately  [5] -[7].  In  IFOC  system  is  using  park  and  calack  transformation  equation  in  order  to 
decouple  flux  and  torque. 

In  this  context,  for  developing  controllers  for  the  plant  the  fuzzy  logic  concepts  play  a  very 
important  no  need  that  much  complicated  hardware  but  just  used  some  set  of  rules  [8].  Interface  system  of 
Takagi-Sugeno  (TS)  type  Fuzzy  are  characterized  by  use  of  function  of  their  input  variable  as  consequents 
and  propose  in  1985.TS  systems  is  powerful  practical  tool  for  modeling  and  controlling  of  complex 
systems  [9].  TheThis  paper  present  performance  for  IM  is  the  output  speed,  so  Takagi-Sugeno  type  of  fuzzy 
logic  control  is  use  as  the  speed  controller  to  obtain  batter  performance.  This  TS  approach  has  been 
extensively  used  to  model  nonlinear  systems  and  has  been  successfully  applied  to  practical  problems  [10]. 
The  basic  idea  from  fault  of  the  speed  IM,  TS  is  use  by  obtain  the  rule  then  produce  the  change  of  torque 
comment  and  decrease  fault  of  speed.

2.  INDUCTION  MOTOR  MODEL  AND  INDIRECT  FIELD  ORIENTED  CONTROL 

Model  of  IM  can  be  obtained  from  their  equivalent  circuit  of  Induction  Motor  shown  in  Figure  1 . 
From  the  equivalent  circuit  Rs  is  stator  resistance,  Rr  is  rotor  resistance,  L/s  is  stator  leakage  inductance,  L/r 
is  rotor  leakage  inductance  and  Ls(Lr)  stator(rotor)  inductance  [11].  Then  model  induction  machine  can  be 
presented  in  synchronousd-q  reference  frame  by  the  following  state  space  model  reference  from  that 
circuit  [12]:

After  analysing  the  mathematical  model  of  IM  and  the  principle  of  Indirect  field-oriented  vector  control 
system,  the  simulation  model  of  field-oriented  control  system  is  established.  The  transformation  from

The  synchronous  angular  velocity  is  often  necessary  in  process  of  the  phase  transformation  for  achieving  the 
favourable  decoupling  control  [14].  The  information  of  the  synchronous  angular  velocity  is  important  in  this 
process.  Number  of  different  reference  frames  shall  derive  for  the  IM.  The  reference  frame  (a-p)  or  (d-q) 
should  be  chosen  for  state-space  deputy  of  the  asynchronous  motor  [15].  The  (d-q)  equation  should  be 
writing  because  it  is  the  most  complex  solution  and  general  [16].  IM  in  mathematical  model,  lEOC,  be 
founded  in  (d-q)  axis  rotating  at  synchronous  speed  (cos)  define  as  follow  [17]:

3.  PROPOSE  TAKAGI-SUGENO  TYPE  FUZZY  LOGIC  CONTROL 

In  this  paper  application  of  fuzzy  logic  to  the  intelligent  speed  control  of  indirect  vector  controlled 
induction  motor  drive  is  investigated.  The  analysis,  design  and  simulation  of  controller  have  been  carried  out 
based  on  the  fuzzy  set  theory.  When  TS  type  EEC  bases  intelligent  controller  is  used,  excellent  control 
performance  can  be  achieved.  Eigure  4  shows  the  general  model  of  a  fuzzy  system,  which  is  composed  of 
four  major  components  [18].  Database  of  TS  is  consists  of  input  (ip)  and  output  (op)  membership  functions. 
The  set  of  linguistic  rule  produce  from  rule  base  of  TS.

4.  RESULT  AND  ANALYSIS 

Simulation  in  this  paper  is  using  MATLAB  investigate  the  performance  of  the  Induction  motor 
using  difference  type  shaped  of  the  membership  function  Fuzzy  logic  control.  For  simulation  used  the 
dynamic  model  of  a  three-phase  induction  motor  of  IFOC  and  TS-  EEC.  The  constant  load  is  applied  for  the 
system.  The  parameters  for  the  motor  are  Vdc  =560V,  50Hz,  Poles=2,  Rs=0.3Q,  Rr=0.25Q,  Ls=0.0415H, 
Lr=0.0412H,  Lm=0.0403H,  J=0.003kg-m2.  To  verify  the  performance  of  the  proposed  TS-  EEC,  the 
simulation  results  will  show  in  detail  for  rise  time  (tr),  settling  time  (ts),  and  steady  state  error  (e%)  .  The 
results  describe  speed  in  revolution  per  minute  (rpm)  versus  time  in  second  (s). Start-up  response  speed  for 
the  speed  control  using  TS  in  4s  is  show  in  Figure  11.
