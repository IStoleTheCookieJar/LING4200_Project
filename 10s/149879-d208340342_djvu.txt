end  of  each  anniversary  of  the  expiration  of  said  ninety  day  period  if  upon  such  anniversary  this  lease  is  being  continued  in  force  solely  by  reason 
of  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.  Each  such  payment  or  tender  shall  be  made  to  the  parties  who  at  the  time  of  payment  would  be  entitled  to 
receive  the  royalties  which  would  be  paid  under  this  lease  if  the  wells  were  producing,  and  may  be  deposited  in  such  bank  as  directed  by  Lessor, 
or  its  successors,  which  shall  continue  as  the  depositories,  regardless  of  changes  in  the  ownership  of  shut-in  royalty.  If  at  any  time  that  Lessee 
pays  or  tenders  shut-In  royalty,  two  or  more  parties  are,  or  claim  to  be,  entitled  to  receive  same.  Lessee  may,  in  lieu  of  any  other  method  of 
payment  herein  provided,  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalty,  in  the  manner  above  specified,  either  jointly  to  such  parties  or  separately  to  each  in 
accordance  with  their  respective  ownerships  thereof,  as  Lessee  may  elect  Any  payment  hereunder  may  be  made  by  check  or  draft  of  Lessee

payment  Nothing  herein  shall  impair  Lessee's  right  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof.  In  the  event  of  assignment  of  this  lease  in  whole 
or  in  part,  liability  lor  payment  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  on  the  then  owner  or  owners  of  this  lease,  severally  as  to  acreage  owned  by  each. 

4.  Lessee  is  hereby  granted  the  right,  at  its  option,  to  pool  or  unitize  any  land  covered  by  this  lease  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  lease, 
and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease,  or  leases,  as  to  any  or  all  minerals  or  horizons,  so  as  to  establish  units  containing  not  more  than  80  surface  acres, 
plus  10%  acreage  tolerance;  provided,  however,  unite  may  be  established  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  or  existing  units  may  be  enlarged  as  to 
any  one  or  more  horizons,  so  as  to  contain  not  more  than  640  surface  acres  plus  1 0%  acreage  tolerance,  if  limited  to  one  or  more  of  the  following: 
(1)  gas,  other  than  casinghead  gas,  (2)  liquid  hydrocarbons  (condensate)  which  are  not  liquids  in  the  subsurface  reservoir,  (3)  minerals  produced 
from  wells  classified  as  gas  wells  by  the  conservation  agency  having  jurisdiction.  If  larger  units  than  any  of  those  herein  permitted,  either  at  the 
time  established,  or  after  enlargement,  are  permitted  or  required  under  any  governmental  rule  or  order,  for  the  dnlling  or  operation  of  a  well  at  a 
regular  location,  or  for  obtaining  maximum  allowable  from  any  well  to  be  drilled,  drlling,  or  already  drilled,  any  such  unit  may  be  established  or 
enlarged  to  conform  to  the  size  permitted  or  required  by  such  governmental  order  or  rule.  Lessee  shall  exercise  said  option  as  to  each  desired  unit 
by  executing  an  instrument  identifying  such  unit  and  filing  it  for  record  in  the  pubic  office-in  which  this  lease  is  recorded.  Such  unit  shall  become 
effective  as  of  the  date  provided  for  in  said  instrument  or  instruments  but  if  said  instrument  or  instruments  make  no  such  provision,  then  such  unit 
shall  become  effective  on  the  date  such  instrument  or  instruments  are  so  filed  of  record.  Each  of  said  options  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  at  any 
time  and  from  time  to  time  while  this  lease  is  In  force,  and  whether  before  or  after  operations  or  production  has  been  established  either  on  said 
land,  or  on  the  portion  of  said  land  included  in  the  unit,  or  on  other  land  unitized  therewith.  A  unit  established  hereunder  shall  be  valid  and  effective 
for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  even  though  there  may  be  mineral,  royalty,  or  leasehold  interests  in  lands  within  the  unit  which  are  not  effectively 
pooled  or  unitized.  Any  operations  conducted  on  any  part  of  such  unitized  land  shall  be  considered,  for  all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of 
royalty,  operations  conducted  upon  said  land  under  this  lease.  There  shall  be  allocated  to  the  land  covered  by  this  lease  within  each  such  unit  (or 
to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  proportion  of  the  total  production  of  unitized 
minerals  from  the  unit  after  deducting  any  used  in  lease  or  unit  operations,  which  the  number  of  surfaoe  acres  in  such  land  (or  in  each  such 
separate  tract)  covered  by  this  lease  within  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres  in  the  unit,  and  the  production  so  allocated  shall  be 
considered  for  all  purposes,  including  payment  or  deivery  of  royalty,  overriding  royalty  and  any  other  payments  out  of  production,  to  be  the  entire 
production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the.  land  to  which  allocated  in  the  same  manner  as  though  produced  therefrom  under  the  terms  of  this  lease. 
The  owner  of  the  reversionary  estate  of  any  term  royalty  or  mineral  estate  agrees  that  the  accrual  of  royalties  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  or  of 
shut-in  royalties  from  a  well  on  the  unit  shal  satisfy  any  limitation  of  term  requiring  production  of  oil  or  gas.  The  formation  of  any  unit  hereunder 
which  includes  land  not  covered  by  this  lease  shal  not  have  the  effect  of  exchanging  or  transferring  any  nterest  under  this  lease  (including,  without 
limitation,  any  shut-in  royalty  which  may  become  payable  under  this  tease)  between  parties  owning  interests  in  land  covered  by  this  tease  and 
parties  owning  interests  in  land  not  covered  by  this  lease.  Neither  shall  It  Impair  the  right  of  Lessee  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof, 
except  that  Lessee  may  not  so  release  as  to  lands  within  a  unit  while  there  are  operations  thereon  for  unitized  minerals  unless  all  pooled  leases 
are  released  as  to  lands  within  the  unit  At  any  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force  Lessee  may  dissolve  any  unit  established  hereunder  by  tiling  for 
record  in  the  public  office  where  this  lease  is  recorded  a  declaration  to  that  effect,  if  at  that  time  there  is  no  unitized  minerals  being  produced  from 
such  unit  Any  unit  formed  may  be  amended,  re-formed,  reduced  or  enlarged  by  Lessee  at  its  election  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  after  the 
original  forming  thereof  by  filing  an  appropriate  Instrument  of  record  in  the  public  office  In  which  the  pooled  acreage  is  located.  Subject  to  the 
provisions  of  this  paragraph  4,  a  unit  once  established  hereunder  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  lease  subject  thereto  shall  remain  in  force.  If

words  separate  tract"  mean  any  tract  with  royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from  that  as  to  any  other 
part  of  the  leased  premises.

part  or  all  of  said  land  or  of  any  mineral  or  horizon  thereunder,  and  thereby  be  relieved  of  all  obligations,  as  to  the  released  acreage  or  interest.

whether  or  not  in  paying  quantities. 

7.  Lessee  shall  have  the  use,  free  from  royalty,  of  water,  other  than  from  Lessor's  water  wells,  and  of  oil  and  gas  produced  from  said  land  in  all 
operations  hereunder.  Lessee  shall  have  the  nght  at  any  time  to  remove  all  machinery  and  fixtures  placed  on  said  land,  including  the  right  to  draw

shall  pay  for  damages  caused  by  its  operations  to  growing  crops  and  timber  on  said  land. 

8.  The  rights  and  estate  of  any  party  hereto  may  be  assigned  from  time  to  time  in  whole  or  in  part  and  as  to  any  mineral  or  horizon.  All  of  the 
covenants,  obligations,  and  considerations  of  this  lease  shaliextend  to  and  be  binding  upon  the  parties  hereto,  their  heirs,  successors,  assigns, 
and  successive  assigns.  No  change  or  division  in  the  ownership  of  said  land,  royalties,  or  other  moneys,  or  any  part  thereof,  howsoever  effected, 
shall  increase  the  obligations  or  diminish  the  rights  of  Lessee,  including,  but  notlimited  to.  the  location  and  drilling  of  wells  and  the  measurement 
of  production.  Notwithstanding  any  other  actual  or  constructive  knowledge  or  notice  thereof  of  or  to  Lessee,  its  successors  or  assigns,  no 
change  or  division  in  the  ownership  of  said  land  or  of  the  royalties,  or  other  moneys,  or  the  right  to  receive  the  same,  howsoever  effected,  shall 
be  binding  upon  the  then  record  owner  of  this  lease  until  sixty  (60)  days  after  there  has  been  furnished  to  such  record  owner  at  his  or  its  principal 
place  of  business  by  Lessor  or  Lessors  heirs,  successors,  or  assigns,  notice  of  such  change  or  division,  supported  by  either  originals  or  duly 
certified  copies  of  the  instruments  which  have  been  properly  filed  for  record  and  which  evidence  such  change  or  division,  and  of  such  court 
records  and  proceedings,  transcripts,  or  other  documents  as  shall  be  necessary  in  the  opinion  of  such  recordowner  to  establish  the  validity  of 
such  change  or  division.  If  any  such  change  in  ownership  occurs  by  reason  of  the  death  of  the  owner,  Lessee  may,  nevertheless  pay  or  tender 
such  royalties,  or  other  moneys,  or  part  thereof,  to  the  credit  of  the  decedent  in  a  depository  bank  provided  for  above. 

9.  In  the  event  Lessor  considers  that  Lessee  has  not  complied  with  all  its  obligations  hereunder,  both  express  and  implied,  Lessor  shall  notify 
Lessee  in  writing,  setting  out  specifically  in  what  respects  Lessee  has  breached  this  contract.  Lessee  shall  then  have  sixty  (60)  days  after  receipt 
of  said  notice  within  which  to  meet  or  commence  to  meet  all  or  any  part  of  the  breaches  alleged  by  Lessor.  The  service  of  said  notice  shall  be 
precedent  to  the  bringing  of  any  action  by  Lessor  on  said  lease  for  any  cause,  and  no  such  action  shall  be  brought  until  the  lapse  of  sixty  (60)  days 
after  service  of  such  notice  on  Lessee.  Neither  the  service  of  said  notice  nor  the  doing  of  any  acts  by  Lessee  aimed  to  meet  all  or  any  of  the 
alleged  breaches  shall  be  deemed  an  admission  or  presumption  that  Lessee  has  failed  to  perform  all  its  obligations  hereunder.  If  this  (ease  is 
canceled  for  any  cause,  it  shall  nevertheless  remain  in  force  and  effect  as  to  (1 )  sufficient  acreage  around  each  well  as  to  which  there  are  operations 
to  constitute  a  drilling  or  maximum  allowable  unit  under  applicable  governmental  regulations,  (but  in  no  event  less  that  forty  acres),  such  acreage 
to  be  designated  by  Lessee  as  nearly  as  practicable  in  the  form  of  a  square  centered  at  the  well,  or  in  such  shape  as  then  existing  spacing  rules 
require;  and  (2)  any  part  of  said  land  included  in  a  pooled  unit  on  which  there  are  operations.  Lessee  shall  also  have  such  easements  on  said  land 
as  are  necessary  to  operations  on  the  acreage  so  retained  and  shall  not  be  required  to  move  or  remove  any  existing  surface  facilities  necessary 
or  convenient  for  current  operations. 

10.  Lessor  hereby  warrants  and  agrees  to  defend  title  to  said  land  against  the  claims  of  all  persons  whomsoever.  Lessor's  rights  and 
interests  hereunder  shall  be  charged  primarily  with  any  mortgages,  taxes  or  other  liens,  or  interest  and  other  charges  on  said  land,  but  Lessor 
agrees  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  to  pay  or  reduce  same  for  Lessor,  either  before  or  after  maturity,  and  be  subrogated  to  the 
rights  of  the  holder  thereof  and  to  deduct  amounts  so  paid  from  royalties  or  other  payments  payable  or  which  may  become  payable  to  Lessor 
and/or  assigns  under  this  lease.  If  this  lease  covers  a  less  interest  in  the  oil,  gas,  sulphur,  or  other  minerals  in  all  or  any  part  of  said  land  than  the 
entire  and  undivided  fee  simple  estate  (whether  Lessor's  interest  is  herein  specified  or  not),  or  no  interest  therein,  then  the  royalties  and  other 
moneys  accruing  from  any  part  as  to  which  this  lease  covers  less  than  such  full  interest  shall  be  paid  only  in  the  proportion  which  the  interest 
therein,  if  any  covered  by  this  lease,  bears  to  the  whole  and  undivided  fee  simple  estate  therein.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether 
or  not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  This  lease  shall  be  binding  upon  each  party  who  executes  it  without 
regard  to  whether  it  is  executed  by  all  those  named  herein  as  Lessor. 

1 1 .  If,  while  this  lease  is  in  force,  at  or  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  hereof,  it  is  not  being  continued  in  force  by  reason  of  the  shut-in 
well  provisions  of  paragraph  3  hereof,  and  Lessee  is  not  conducting  operations  on  said  land  by  reason  of  (1)  any  law,  order,  rule  or  regulation, 
(whether  or  not  subsequently  determined  to  be  invalid)  or  (2)  any  other  cause,  whether  similar  or  dissimilar,  (except  financial)  beyond  the 
reasonable  control  of  Lessee,  the  primary  term  hereof  shall  be  extended  until  the  first  anniversary  date  hereof  occurring  ninety  (90)  or  more 
days  following  the  removal  of  such  delaying  cause,  and  this  lease  may  be  extended  thereafter  by  operations  as  if  such  delay  had  not  occurred. 

12.  Lessor  agrees  that  this  lease  covers  and  includes  any  and  all  of  Lessor's  rights  in  and  to  any  existing  weH(s)  and/or  wellbore(s)  on  said 
land,  other  than  existing  water  wells,  and  for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  the  re-entry  and  use  by  Lessee  of  any  existing  well  and/or  wellbore  shall  be 
deemed  the  same  as  the  drilling  of  a  new  well. 

13.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  lease,  at  the  option  of  Lessee,  which  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee 
giving  notice  to  Lessor,  a  well  which  has  been  drilled  and  Lessee  intends  to  frac  shall  be  deemed  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying 
quantities  and  the  date  such  well  is  shut-in  shall  be  when  the  drilling  operations  are  completed. 

14.  As  a  result  of  land  development  in  the  vicinity  of  said  land,  governmental  rules  or  ordinances  regarding  well  sites,  and/or  surface 
restrictions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  this  lease  and/or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity,  surface  locations  for  well  sites  in  the  vicinity  may  be  limited 
and  Lessee  may  encounter  difficulty  securing  surface  location(s)  for  drilling,  reworking  or  other  operations.  Therefore,  since  drilling, 
reworking  or  other  operations  are  either  restricted  or  not  allowed  on  said  land  or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity,  it  is  agreed  that  any  such 
operations  conducted  at  a  surface  location  off  of  said  land  or  off  of  lands  with  which  said  land  are  pooled  in  accordance  with  this  lease, 
provided  that  such  operations  are  associated  with  a  directional  well  for  the  purpose  of  drilling,  reworking,  producing  or  other  operations 
under  said  land  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  shall  for  purposes  of  this  lease  be  deemed  operations  conducted  on  said  land.  Nothing 
contained  in  this  paragraph  is  intended  to  modify  any  surface  restrictions  or  pooling  provisions  or  restrictions  contained  in  this  lease, 
except  as  expressly  stated. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  this  instrument  is  executed  on  the  date  first  above  written.

THE  PROVISIONS  OF  ADDENDUM  SUPERSEDE  COMPLETELY  ANY  PROVISIONS 
TO  THE  CONTRARY  CONTAINED  IN  THE  LEASE  TO  WHICH  THIS  ADDENDUM  IS 
ATTACHED. 


15.  Minerals  Covered.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  hereof,  this  lease 
covers  only  oil  and  gas.  The  term  "oil  and  gas"  means  oil,  gas,  and  other 
liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  and  their  constituent  elements  produced 
through  a  well  bore. 


16.  Gas  Royalty.  Lessor's  royalty  shall  be  calculated  free  and  clear  of  costs 
and  expenses  for  exploration,  drilling,  development  and  production, 
including,  but  not  limited  to,  dehydration,  storage,  compression, 
separation  by  mechanical  means  and  product  stabilization,  incurred  prior 
to  the  oil,  gas  and  other  mineral  production  leaving  the  leased  premises  or 
prior  to  delivery  into  a  pipeline  or  gathering  system,  whichever  occurs  first; 
provided,  however,  (a)  Lessee  shall  have  free  use  of  produced  oil  and  gas 
for  operations  conducted  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled 
therewith,  and  the  royalties  on  oil  and  gas  herein  provided  shall  be 
computed  after  deducting  any  so  used,  and  (b)  Lessor's  royalty  shall  bear 
its  proportionate  share  of  all  ad  valorem  taxes  and  production,  severance 
and  other  taxes  and  the  actual,  reasonable  costs  (including  compression 
and  related  fuel  charges)  paid  to  or  deducted  by  an  unaffiliated  third  party 
to  transport,  compress,  stabilize,  process  or  treat  the  oil,  gas  and  other 
mineral  production  off  the  leased  premises  in  order  to  make  the  oil,  gas 
and  other  mineral  production  saleable,  increase  its  value  or  in  order  to  get 
the  oil,  gas  and  other  mineral  production  to  a  market. 


17.  Shut-in  Royalty.  If  at  the  end  of  the  primary  term  or  any  time  thereafter 
one  or  more  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  are 
capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby  in 
paying  quantities,  but  such  well  or  wells  are  either  shut-in  or  production 


therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  such  well  or  wells  shall 
nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying  quantities  for  the 
purpose  of  maintaining  this  Lease.  A  well  that  has  been  drilled  but  not 
traced  shall  be  deemed  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities.  If  for  a 
period  of  ninety  (90)  consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or 
production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall  pay 
shut-in  royalty  of  twenty  five  dollars  ($25.00)  per  acre  then  covered  by  this 
Lease  on  or  before  the  end  of  said  90  -day  period  and  thereafter  on  or 
before  each  anniversary  of  the  end  of  said  90  -day  period  while  the  well  or 
wells  are  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee; 
provided,  however,  that  if  this  Lease  is  otherwise  being  maintained  by 
operations,  or  if  production  is  being  sold  by  Lessee  from  another  well  or 
wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  no  shut-in  royalty 
shall  be  due  until  the  end  of  the  90-day  period  next  following  cessation  of 
such  operations  or  production.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary 
herein,  it  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  after  the  expiration  of 
the  primary  term,  Lessee  shall  not  have  the  right  to  continue  this  Lease  in 
force  by  payment  of  shut-in  royalty  for  more  than  one  single  period  of  up 
to  two  (2)  consecutive  years. 


18.  No  Surface  Operations.  It  is  hereby  agreed  and  understood  that  there 
shall  be  no  drilling  activities  on  the  surface  of  the  leased  premises  without 
the  prior  written  permission  from  the  surface  owner  of  the  applicable 
portion  of  the  leased  premises.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  waiver 
of  surface  shall  not  be  construed  as  a  waiver  of  the  rights  of  Lessee  to 
utilize  the  subsurface  of  the  leased  premises  under  this  lease,  and  Lessee 
shall  have  the  right  to  exploit,  explore  for,  develop  and  produce  oil,  gas 
and  other  covered  minerals  under  this  lease  from  wells  from  surface 
locations  off  the  leased  premises,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  directional 
or  horizontal  drilling  activity  which  comes  under  the  surface  of  the  leased 
premises.  This  drilling  surface  waiver  does  not  apply  to  any  surface  rights 
associated  with  instruments  other  than  this  lease. 


19.  Vertical  Pugh.  Upon  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  of  this  Lease, 
upon  the  expiration  of  any  extension  or  renewal  of  the  primary  term,  or 
after  cessation  of  operations  as  provided  herein,  whichever  occurs  last, 
this  Lease  shall  terminate  as  to  all  rights  lying  below  one  hundred  feet 
(100')  below  the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of  the  deepest  formation  drilled. 


20.     No  Warranties.  Lessor  makes  no  warranty  of  any  kind  with  respect  to 
title  to  the  Land.  By  acceptance  of  this  Lease,  Lessee  acknowledges  that

Lessee: 


it  has  been  given  every  opportunity  to  investigate  and  has  conducted 
sufficient  investigation  to  satisfy  itself  as  to  the  title  to  the  Land,  and 
Lessee  assumes  all  risk  of  title  failures.  All  warranties  that  might  arise  by 
common  law  or  by  statute,  including  but  not  limited  to  Section  5.023  of  the 
Texas  Property  Code  (or  its  successors),  are  excluded.  If  Lessor  owns  an 
interest  in  the  Land  less  than  the  entire  fee  simple  estate,  then  the 
royalties  (including  shut-in  royalties)  payable  hereunder  will  be  reduced 
proportionately.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether  or  not 
owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  Lessor 
will  use  all  its  reasonable  efforts  to  assist  Lessee  to  subordinate  any  rights 
of  a  mortgage  holder  to  perfect  the  Lessee's  rights  under  this  lease; 
provided,  however,  any  necessary  subordination  shall  be  obtained  by 
Lessee  at  Lessee's  sole  expense.  In  the  event  Lessee  is  unable  to  obtain 
a  subordination  agreement,  Lessee,  at  its  option,  may  discharge  any  tax, 
mortgage,  or  other  lien  or  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  Land  superior 
to  this  Lease,  and  in  the  event  Lessee  does  so,  Lessee  will  have  the 
option  of  applying  the  royalties  accruing  to  Lessor  toward  payment  of 
same  and  Lessee  shall  be  subrogated  to  the  rights  of  the  holder  thereof. 


Executed  on  the  date  first  written  above.
