Abstract.  The  article  reviews  the  electrophysiological  characteristics  of  pre-cambial  phloem  material  in  undergrowth 
shrubs.  The  electrophysiological  properties  of  hazel  ( Coiylus  avellana  L.),  elder  ( Sambucus  nigra  L.)  and  other  un- 
dergrowth shrubs  are  compared,  as  well  as  how  these  characteristics  change  depending  on  stand  density  indices. 
Differences  in  electrophysiological  characteristics  reveal  the  crucial  role  of  light  for  the  growth,  development,  and 
persistence  of  undergrowth  shrubs.  I suggest  that  a quantitative  assessment  of  electrophysiological  characteristics 
should  be  undertaken  when  managing  forest  stands  for  the  creation  of  desirable  undergrowth. 

Key  words:  electrophysiological  characteristics,  dielectric  parameters,  understorey,  impedance,  polarization  capacity, 
shrubs,  stand  density. 


1.  Introduction 

An  understorey  is  an  important  element  of  the  forest 
ecosystem  (Morozov  1926;  Ivanitsky  1939;  Vysockyj 
1983;  Gil  2010).  While  biological  characteristics  of  un- 
dergrowth shrubs  have  been  a subject  of  the  accurate 
research,  their  electrophysiological  characteristics  such 
as  bioelectrical  potential  (impedance  and  polarization 
capacity)  have  been  less  studied.  In  environmental  re- 
search such  characteristics  are  commonly  used  regard- 
ing trees  (Mac  Dougall  1988;  Krynic’kyj  1992;  Zaika 
2004;  Lavnyj,  Krynic’kyj  2011)  as  integral  indices  of 
the  intensity  and  specific  character  of  day’s,  seasonal 
and  ontogenetic  physiological  and  biochemical  proc- 
esses. These  characteristics  are  also  used  to  characterize 
general  plants’  condition. 

The  pre-cambial  group  of  tree  and  shrub  tissues  con- 
sists of  cambium,  phloem,  and  sapwood.  These  tissues 
are  characterized  by  high  physiological  activity.  They 
are  susceptible  to  plants’  condition  changes  and  are 
easily  detected  by  measurement  instrument’s  sensors. 


Their  electrical  characteristics  differ  significantly  from 
the  characteristics  of  other  tissues.  The  obtained  results 
of  Mac  Dougall’s  (1988),  Krynicki’s  (1992),  Zaika’s 
(2004),  and  Lavnyja  and  Krynicki’s  (2011)  research 
have  indicated  that  impedance  and  polarization  capacity 
correlate  either  moderately  or  closely  with  intensity  of 
the  tree  growth  in  various  growth  stages  of  the  stand, 
with  the  phytomass  growth,  plants’  location,  and  with 
the  extent  of  tree  damages  caused  by  insects.  Impedance 
of  pre-cambial  tissues  of  trees  in  the  predominant  layer 
is  lower  than  that  of  trees  in  other  layers.  Moreover, 
there  is  a distinct  relation  between  polarization  capac- 
ity, growth,  and  biomass  of  the  assimilation  apparatus. 
Electrophysiological  characteristics  of  the  understorey 
have  not  been  studied  yet,  either  in  the  forest-steppe 
zone  of  western  Ukraine  or  in  the  rest  of  the  natural  zone 
of  the  region.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the 
electrophysiological  characteristics  (impedance  and  po- 
larization capacity)  of  shrub  tissues  in  the  understorey 
of  the  Carpinetum  betuli  in  the  forest-steppe  zone  of 
western  Ukraine.

2.  Research  subject 

Research  was  conducted  in  Tarnopol  region,  in  the 
“Medobory”  reservoir  (Wiknianskie  forest  district)  and 
in  Tarnopolskie  forest  inspectorate  (Mykulyneckie  for- 
est district).  This  is  a composition  of  the  “Medobory” 
reservoir  (Wiknianskie  forest  district),  where  the  hazel 
understorey  was  found:  lODb  (10  Oak)  and  admixture 
of  species  such  as  hornbeam,  lime,  and  northern  red 
oak.  Stand  density  index  was  0.7,  and  age  60  years. 
Research  of  the  black  elder  understorey  was  conduct- 
ed in  Wiknianskie  forestry  district,  quarter  18,  Gostra 
Mountain,  in  the  middle  age  Carpinetum  betuli  3Db7Gb 
(3  Oak  7 Hardwood).  Studies  of  electrophysiologi- 
cal  characteristics  of  shrub  species  were  conducted  in 
two  places  in  Wiknianskie  forest  district:  1)  in  the  first 
age  class  thicket  after  early  cleaning,  2)  in  full-grown 
broad-leaved  stand.  There  were  12  shrub  species  in  the 
greenwood  without  a forest  canopy:  common  hazel 
( Corylus  avellana  L.),  European  spindle  (Euonymus 
europaea  L.)  and  Euonymus  verrucosus  Scorp.,  black 
elder  ( Sambucus  nigra  L.),  common  dogwood  ( Cornus 
sanguinea  L.),  alder  buckthorn  (Frangula  alnus  Mill.), 
common  buckthorn  ( Rhamnus  cathartica  L.),  black- 


thorn ( Prunus  spinosa  L.),  dog  rose  ( Rosa  canina  L.), 
water  elder  ( Viburnum  opulus  L.),  Spiraea  L.,  and  com- 
mon hawthorn  ( Crataegus  monogyna  Jacq.). 

The  broad-leaved  stand,  where  a number  of  shrub 
species  were  found  under  the  forest  canopy  (common 
hazel,  common  spindle,  Euonymus  verrucosus  Scorp., 
black  elder,  common  dogwood,  and  common  haw- 
thorn), was  characterized  as  the  Carpinetum  betuli  in 
the  fresh  deciduous  site  type  of  the  locally  variable 
species  composition:  English  oak  - 20-30%,  European 
ash  - 10-20%,  Norway  maple  - 10-20%,  hornbeam  - 
30-60%.  The  stand  was  the  first  age  class  - ‘growing- 
full-grown’.  There  was  0.7-0. 8 hedge  of  the  stand. 

3.  Methodology 

Dielectric  parameters  of  pre-cambial  plant  tissues 
(impedance  and  polarization  capacity)  were  measured  by 
the  measuring  instrument  RLC-F4320.  Measurements 
were  conducted  at  frequency  1 kHz.  Electrodes  were 
placed  into  the  plants’  phloems  at  height  0.20  m at  the 
land  level.  Distance  between  the  electrodes  was  2 cm 
(Krynicki  1992).

In  regard  to  the  most  common  species  in  the  re- 
gion - common  hazel  ( Corylus  avellana  L.)  and  black 
elder  ( Sambucus  nigra  L.)  - their  persistence  was  de- 
fined depending  on  the  hedge.  There  were  20  repetitions 
on  average.  Student’s  t-test  was  used  for  the  statistical 
analysis. 

4.  Results  and  discussion 

Research  results  of  dielectric  parameters  of  the 
common  hazel  and  black  elder,  depending  on  a hedge 
of  the  stand,  are  presented  in  table  1 . Measurement  re- 
sults (tab.l)  indicate  that  dielectric  parameters  of  the 
common  hazel  and  black  elder  change  significantly 
depending  on  hedges.  In  regard  to  common  hazel. 


impedance  parameters  fluctuate  within  the  scope  of 
22.9-41.2  k£2m,  and  polarization  capacity  within 
1.16-2.08  nF.  There  is  considerably  lower  impedance 
(circa  10%)  observed  and  significantly  higher  polariza- 
tion capacity  (circa  39,6%)  in  the  stand  of  0.4  hedge  than 
in  the  control  environment  (the  stand  edge).  Growing 
conditions  and  hazel’s  persistence  get  worse  in  conjunc- 
tion with  the  higher  hedge.  When  there  is  0.8  hedge,  im- 
pedance indicator  of  the  hazel  goes  up  to  79.9%,  and  po- 
larization capacity  indicator  is  reduced  to  22.1%.  When 
a hedge  is  small,  the  growing  conditions  are  the  best  for 
common  hazel.  A variability  coefficient  of  impedance 
is  lowest  when  there  is  0.4  hedge  (39.2%).  Though,  it  is 
higher  both  in  the  stand  edge  (48.2%)  and  when  there 
is  0.8  hedge  (45.7%).  A variability  coefficient  of  polari- 
zation capacity  changes  from  37.9%  to  64.2%.

Dielectric  parameters  of  the  black  elder  were  stud- 
ied in  the  stand  edge  (control)  and  when  there  was 
0.5-0. 9 hedge  (tab.l).  An  increase  of  impedance  and 
a reduction  of  polarization  capacity  of  elder  tissues  are 
observed  as  the  hedge  increases.  Therefore,  impedance 
of  the  black  elder  in  the  stand  edge  is  5.6  kflm,  and  under 
the  forest  canopy  of  the  various  hedges  it  is  2. 0-3. 2 fold 
higher.  Polarization  capacity  indices  of  the  black  elder 
under  the  forest  canopy  are  significantly  lower  - circa 
33.4-59.9%  - than  in  the  control. 

The  most  favorable  growing  conditions  for  black 
elder  are  in  the  stand  edge.  Under  the  forest  canopy, 
elder’s  condition  get  worse  as  the  hedge  increases. 

Dielectric  parameters  variability  coefficients  of  the 
black  elder  in  the  control  and  in  researched  alternatives 
vary  between  11.1  and  59.9%.  The  lowest  coefficients 
are  in  the  control  and  in  the  stand  of  0.9  hedge. 

In  order  to  determine  the  influence  of  phytocenosis 
coefficients  on  undergrowth  species  and  their  persist- 
ence, research  on  dielectric  parameters  in  the  open- 
space  and  under  the  forest  canopy  of  0.7-0. 8 hedge  was 
conducted.  The  results  are  presented  in  table  2. 

The  results  presented  in  table  2 show  that  impedance 
parameters  of  shrubs  in  the  open-space  and  under  the 
forest  canopy  differ  statistically  significantly.  The  low- 
est values  of  impedance  and  high  values  of  polarization 
capacity  are  observed  regarding  all  shrub  species  in  the 
open-space.  Impedance  indices  of  hazel  growing  under 
the  forest  canopy  are  39.5%  higher,  Euonymus  verru- 
cosus Scop.  - 56%  higher,  alder  buckthorn  - 50.8%, 
European  spindle  - 4 fold  higher,  black  elder  - over 
3 fold  higher,  and  common  dogwood  - almost  twice  fold 
higher.  Polarization  capacity  indices  of  hazel  growing 
under  the  forest  canopy  were  26.7-69.9%  lower  than  in 
the  control  (the  open-space).  The  obtained  results  indi- 
cate lower  intensity  of  shrub  metabolic  processes  under 
the  forest  canopy  of  0.7-0  hedge  than  in  the  open-space. 
The  results  show  that  shrub  impedance  varies  between 
11.1  and  51.1  kOm  in  the  open-space,  and  polarization 
capacity  between  0.54  and  3.37%  (tab.  2).  Variability 
of  shrub  dielectric  parameters  varies  between  14.9  and 
47.2%  in  the  open-space. 


5.  Conclusion 

In  the  open-space  we  observed  differences  in  the 
shrub  growth  conditioned  genetically  which  indicates 
influence  on  electrophysiological  characteristics  pre- 
sented in  the  article.  European  spindle,  black  elder,  and 
common  buckthorn  are  characterized  by  low  impedance 
and  high  polarization  capacity.  Spiraea  and  common 
hazel  are  characterized  by  high  impedance  and  low  po- 
larization capacity.  High  variability  of  impedance  pa- 
rameters and  polarization  capacity  is  characteristic  for 
common  buckthorn,  common  dogwood,  and  common 
hawthorn.  Spiraea  and  common  hazel  are  character- 
ized by  low  variability  of  impedance  and  polarization 
capacity.  The  observed  differences  in  electrophysiologi- 
cal characteristics  reveal  the  crucial  role  of  light  for  the 
growth,  development,  and  persistence  of  undergrowth 
shrubs.  I suggest  that  a quantitative  assessment  of  the 
electrophysiological  characteristics  should  be  undertak- 
en when  managing  forest  stands  cultivation  and  while 
creating  shrub  layer.
