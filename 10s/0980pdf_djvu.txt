Improvement 

By  VIA  TT  CASSELL 

In  a year  m which  all  facets  of 
MBA  life  will  be  looked  at  carefully. 
Headmaster  Gordon  E.  Bondurant 
is  looking  to  find  a thoughtful 
statement  about  MBA  to  find  the 
best  direction  towards 
improvement. 

In  this  interview  with  The  Bell 
Ringer.  Mr.  Bondurant  focused  on 
the  changes  the  evaluation  would 
bring  over  the  next  year.  In  the  fall 
of  1981.  MBA  will  be  evaluated  by 
the  Southern  Association  of 
Colleges  and  Schools.  Over  the  next 
year,  the  student  body,  (acuity, 
parents,  alumni,  administration. and 
trustees  will  become  involved  in  a 
thorough  examination  of  all  facets 
ol  MBA  lire. 

Mr  Bondurant  told  The  Bell 
Ringer  a little  bit  about  each 
committee.  The  philosophy 
committee,  w hich  has  already  begun 
meeting,  is  trying  to  find  a statement 
which  reflects  the  idcasand  attitudes 
of  MBA 

I he  Student  Services  Committee 
will  meet  to  discuss  such  things  as 
guidance  and  counseling  tor  the 
students  as  well  as  food  and  medical 
serv  ices.  Other  committees  include 
Curriculum.  Facilities.  Faculty  and 
Administration,  plus  a student 
activities  committee. 

Each  committee  is  searching  for 
both  the  st  rengthsand  weaknesses  in 
each  area.  The  resultant  statement 
will  be  used  to  improve  upon  the 
problems  and  to  aid  in  giving  MBA  a 
direction  in  which  to  head  towards 
continued  success. 

The  Bell  Ringer  asked  Mr. 
Bondurant  about  any  changes  which 
have  been  made  since  last  year.  Mr. 
Bondurant  replied  that  the  mjaor 
curriculum  change  had  been  in  the 
Junior  School. 

For  the  seventh  grade,  art  is  now 
required  and  an  extra  day  has  been 
added  for  science.  History  and 
geography  have  been  combined  for 
one  class.  The  eighth  graders  have 
been  given  the  freedom  to  move 
Irom  class  to  class  and  will  soon  be

given  lockers.  Ihcse  changes  will 
have  a positive  effect  on  the 
education  in  the  Junior  School. 

Other  changes  on  campus  have 
been  physical  in  nature.  Such'hings 
as  Mr.  Drake's  new  office,  the 
addition  of  storm  windows  to  the 
Science  Building,  and  a few  other 
cosmetic  changes  will  result  in  more 
conveniences  for  the  student  body. 

Mr.  Bondurant  complimented  the 
new  faculty  which  he  considers  to  be 
a competent,  well-qualified,  caring 
group.  With  the  new  faculty.  Mr. 
Bondurant  is  looking  for  great 
success.  In  particular.  Mr. 
Bondurant  felt  that  a new  emthasis 
had  been  put  on  speech,  whch  he 
feels  very  strongly  for. 

Over  the  next  year.  Mr. 
Bondurant  told  The  Bell  Ringerihat 
he  was  looking  to  continue 
improvement  in  teacher-student 
relations.  By  making  the  advisory 
system  work  better.  Mr.  Bondurant 
hopes  to  improve  these  relations 
both  at  school  and  beyond  school  in 
both  a social  and  learning 
atmosphere. 

Other  programs  Mr.  Burdanl 
looks  towardsare  more  social  events 
and  possible  programs  with  sister 
schools. 

In  this  year  of  evaluation.  Mr. 
Bondurant  is  looking  for  a 
thoughtful  statement  to  induce 
improvement  and  success.  MBA's 
overall  objective  will  be  towards 
•'excellence  in  the  classroom"  while 
helping  each  student  grow  both 
physically  and  mentally.

Every  year  there  are  new  faces  on 
the  M.B.A.  campus.  Many  of  these 
faces  arc  those  of  new  students  but 
several  of  these  new  people  are 
teachers.  This  year  M.B.A.  has  six 
new  faculty  members  representing 
the  sciences.  English,  and  forensics.

College  Board  Announces  SAT  Dates 


Dates  for  this  year's 
administrations  of  the  Scholastic 
Aptitude  Test  (SAT),  required  for 
admission  by  hundreds  of  colleges 
nationally,  will  be  Nov.  I and  Dec.  6. 
1980  and  Jan.  24.  April.  May  2.  and 
June  6.  1981.  according  to  the 
College  Board,  the  national 
nonprofit  educational  association 
which  sponsors  the  tests. 

I he  SAT.  taken  by  high  school 
juniors  and  seniors,  measures  v erbal 
and  malhemaucal  skills  developed 
over  a long  period  of  time,  both  in 
and  out  of  school.  SAT  scores 
correlate  highly  with  academic- 
performance  in  college  and  serve  as 
a common  currency  for  evaluating 
students  from  all  parts  ol  the 
country.  A recent  survey  showed 
that  test  scores  arc  just  one  of  several 
factors  college  admissions  officers 
consider  in  making  admissions 
decisions. 

The  multiple-choice  SAT  takes 
twoandahalf  hours;  anaddilion'30 
minutes  is  devoted  to  the  Test  of 
Standard  Written  English,  which 
measures  a student's  ability  to 
recognize  standard  written  English 
and  is  used  by  many  colleges  to  place 
freshmen  in  appropriate  English 
classes. 

I he  College  Board  said  that 
Achievement  Tests  in  various 
subjects  will  also  be  administered  on 


most  of  the  SAT  dates.  These  one- 
hour  tests  enable  students  to 
demonstrate  knowledge  in  I4diverse 
subjects  and  help  colleges  make 
placement  and  admissionsdccisions. 

Last  year,  approximately  1.5 
million  students  took  the  SAT  and 
had  reports  sent  to  over  3.000 
colleges,  universities,  and 
scholarships  agencies.  More  than 
270,000  students  took  one  or  more  of 
the  Achievement  Tests. 

If  you  plan  to  take  these  tests  you 
should  register  at  least  five  weeks  in 
advance  to  meet  deadlinesand  avoid 
a S6  late  Ice.  (See  schedules  and  fees 
below.)  Scores  arc  reported  to  you. 
your  school,  and  the  colleges  you 
designate,  within  six  weeks  after  the 
tests  are  administered. 

Registration  information  and 
forms  arc  available  from  your  high 
school  guidance  counselor.  Test  fees 
are  S9.25  for  the  SAT  and  SIS  for 
one.  two  or  three  Achievement  Tests 
taken  on  the  same  day.  Students 
unable  to  pay  test  fees  may  be 
eligible  for  fee  waivers.  Last  year, 
more  then  33.000  fee  waivers  were 
provided  to  needy  students. 

If  you  are  not  able  to  register  in 
adv  ance,  you  may  be  accommodated 
on  the  test  dales  for  a SI 5 “walk-in" 
fee.  plus  the  regular  fee.  provided  the 
test  center  has  extra  test  booklets 


Honor  Council  Strives  For  Involvement 


By  STEVE  HINES 
I he  major  goal  set  by  this  year's 
Honor  Council  is  to  abolish  the 
general  apathy  of  the  MBA  students 
toward  the  Honor  Council  and  its 
enforcement  of  the  Honor  System. 

It  is  the  duty  of  every  boy  at  MBA 
to  respect  and  uphold  the  standards 
of  honor  and  integrity  drawn  up  in 
the  Constitution  of  the  Honor 
System,  for  the  Honor  System 
belongs  to  every  person  here. 

The  representatives  from  each 
class  are  aware  of  their  duty  to 
enforce  these  standards  of  honesty 
and  to  voice  their  opinions  of  each 
case  brought  before  the  Honor 
Council.  The  members  of  the  Honor 
Council  for  this  year  are  as  follows: 
David  Mcllwain  and  Steve  Malcr, 


sophomore  officers;  Steve 
Anderson.  Mabo  Kono,  and  David 
White,  junior  officers;  Brian 
Nicholson,  treasurer.  Jim  Harrison, 
secretary.  Mark  Daniel,  vice- 
president.  and  Steve  Hines, 
president.  I he  representatives  Irom 
the  freshman  class  and  the  junior 
school  will  be  elected  by  their 
respective  class  members  in  the  near 
future  In  subsequent  elections,  the 
name  for  the  officer  elected  as  the 
secretary  will  be  altered  to  a second 
vice-president,  and  that  for  the 
treasurer  will  be  changed  to 
secretary.  This  modification  will 
release  the  Honor  Council  fromany 
implications  that  it  deals  with 
money. 

The  Constitution  of  the  Honor 


Council  states  that  anyone  accused 
of  lying,  cheating,  or  stealing  shall  be 
questioned  by  the  Council  in  order 
order  to  settle  the  alleged  violation. 
A person  who  accuses  another  will 
remain  anonymous  to  everyone  but 
the  officers  of  the  Honor  Council 
The  Council  determines  the 
punishment  for  a convicted 
violator,  and  the  extent  of 
punishment  depends  on  the  sev  erity 
of  the  offense  and  the  violator's 
prev  ious  Honor  Council  record,  if 
any. 

This  year,  the  Honor  Council 
hopes  to  continue  to  be  an  integral 
factor  of  MBA  life  and  to  provide  a 
base  for  respect  of  other's 
possessions  and  a sense  of  honor  on 
the  Hill.

Kicks-Off 

Year 

B v DON  FAIRBAIRN 

On  Thursday  and  Friday.  August 
27th  and  28th.  the  students  of 
Montgomery  Bell  Academy  once 
again  returned  to  the  Hill  to  register 
for  the  1980-81  school  year. 

I he  days  were  ones  of  great 
confusion  as  nearly  five  hundred 
students  attempted  to  secure  their 
lockers,  buy  their  books,  sign  the 
MBA  register,  etc.  Much  of  the 
usual  grumbling  about  assignments 
and  schedules  continued,  as  well  as 
talk  about  how  much  summer 
reading  everyone  had  left  to  do. 

For  new  students,  registration  was 
the  beginning  of  a very  strange  and 
somewhat  frightening  process  of 
adjusting  to  the  demanding 
environment  of  the  school. 

For  the  many  students  who  have 
spent  several  years  at  MBA. 
registration  was  an  activity  to  be 
completed  as  quickly  aspossibleand 
then  forgotten. 

No  matter  how'  much  the  students 
regretted  having  to  return  to  school.

successful  football  season,  the 
attempts  of  the  cheerleaders  to 
promote  school  spirit,  the  incipient 
beginnings  of  numerous  extra- 
curricular activities  all  gave 
registration  an  air  of  expectation 
about  the  coming  year.

In  order  to  prepare  for  the  season, 
the  MBA  chccrlcading  squad 
traveled  to  Knoxville  for  the 
University  of  Tennessee 
chccrlcading  camp  sponsored  by  the 
National  Cheerleaders  Association, 
where  they  were  greeted  by  eight 
hundred  fifty  screaming  girls.  Here, 
the  squad  learned  some  new  cheers, 
pyramids,  and  partner  stunts.  The 
instructors  gave  our  squad  special 
attention  because  we  were  one  of 
only  two  teams  with  boys.  This 
special  attention  led  to  harder  work 
which  culminated  in  our  squad's 
receiving  a spirit  stick  which 
exemplifies  the  epitome  of  a spirited 
squad 

Plans  for  the  year  include  highly 
spirited  pep  rallies,  caravans  to  the 
football  games,  and  the  sale  of  Big 
Red  buttons  and  stickers.  Therewill 
be  several  surprises  in  our  pep  rallies 
this  year,  as  well  as  the  intorduction 
ol  the  various  divisions  of  the  team 
such  as  offensive  line,  back  field,  etc. 
However,  the  biggest  change  this 
year  will  be  the  spirit  competition 
between  classes.  We  encourage 
everyone  to  come  to  pep  rallies  and 
games  and  to  catch  the  growing 
spirit  at  MBA.

Football.  The  word  brings  to 
mind  many  though lv  thccxcitcmcnl 
of  the  games  on  Friday  nights,  the 
spirit  and  iniative  ol  the 
cheerleaders,  the  enthusiastic 
support  of  the  student  body,  the 
pnde  in  the  winning  tradition  at 
MBA.  Yet  docs  anyone  (except  for 
the  football  players  themselves) 
know  what  is  behind  the  bright  lights 
and  glory? 

It  all  begins  in  December  with  the 
start  of  winter  athletics.  Those 
players  who  are  not  fortunate 
enough  to  be  wrestling  or  playing 
basketball  enter  Coach  Owens’ 
weights  and  agility  program.  Three 
days  a week  we  pump  iron  bench 
press,  leg  press,  dips,  squats,  curls. 
Two  days  a week  we  do 
agilities  long  distance  running,  ten 
yard  sprints,  lateral  quickness, 
vertical  jumps.  We  must  improve 
our  strength,  our  speed : the  Big  Red 
must  he  physically  superior  to  other 
teams.  These  workouts  continue 
through  the  winter  and  spring  for 
those  of  us  who  do  not  play  baseball, 
soccer,  or  track 

As  May  becomes  June  and  the 
burdens  of  MBA  academics  are 
lifted,  we  apply  outselves  to  football 
training  with  renewed  vigor.  We  lift 
weights  five  days  a week.  We  sprint 
countless  40’s,  trying  to  get  the  time 


down  as  low  as  possible. 

August  7.  1980.  The  first  meeting 
of  the  MBA  football  team.  Coach 
Owen  talks  about  the  play  book,  the 
rules,  everything  necessary  for 
proper  mental  preparation. 

After  several  days  of  practice,  my 
entire  body  aches  from  the  running, 
the  hitting,  the  physical  torture.  I 
cannot  concentrate  on  the  coach's 
instructions.  I can  only  think  of  the 
pain,  the  heat,  and  the  fact  that  I was 
passed  over  when  the  managers 
brought  water  to  our  group.  I am 
totally  exhausted  each  day.  yet  I 
continue;  we  continue;  for  what? 

Finally  two-a-days  end.  and  we 
begin  to  recover,  to  regain  the 
strength  which  has  been  sapped  from 
us. 

Practice  focuses  around  the  weak 
points  in  our  squad.  We  continue  to 
work,  honing  our  skills,  preparing 
Tor  the  season. 

September  5.  1980.  I stand 

exhausted  and  look  at  the 
scoreboard  after  the  game.  Our 
defense  has  held;  the  offense  was 
able  to  move  the  ball;  we  emerged 
victorious.  And  now  the  struggles  of 
the  past  nine  months  arc  forgotten. 
The  hard  work,  the  physical  and 
mental  punishment  have  finally 
begun  to  pay  off.

White's  Creek 


By  TOM  WOOD 

The  Big  Red  opened  the  season 
with  a convincing  24-0  conquest  of 
Whitc'sCrcck  on  the  Cobras’  home 
field.  The  game  was  dominated  by  a 
tough  M.B.A.  defense  which 
completely  nullified  the 
oppositions  speedy  offense.  The 
Red  offense,  meanwhile, 
systematically  moved  the  ball, 
mainly  on  the  ground  behind  the 
blocking  of  an  excellent  offensive 
line. 

Quarterback  Tom  DiVitlorio 
drew  first  blood  with  a one-yard 
plunge  in  the  second  quarter,  and 
Adam  Wicck  booted  the  extra  point 
to  give  M B A a a7-0  halftime  lead. 

In  thethind  quarter  Kris  Klausner 
turned  a short  pass  into  a big  gainer 
to  set  up  Mark  Daniel’s  one-yard 
run.  which  was  followed  on  the  next 
scries  by  Scott  Haynes'  24-yard  field 
goal.  This  was  set  up  by  Ally 
Fuqua's  blocking  of  a Cobra  punt. 
Big  Billy  Rolfc  crashed  over  from  a 
yard  out  with  five  minutes  left  in  the 
game  to  provide  the  final  margin. 


I his  is  a major  step  for  the  art 
program.  Also,  numerous  projects 
are  planned,  from  art  shows  with 
liarpeth  Hall  to  a special  work  by 
the  junior  school  for  this  year's 
homecoming.  New  acquisitions 
include  a printing  press  and  plans  for 
a garden-workspace.  Every  student 
is  welcomed  to  join  M.B.A. ’s  fastest 
growing  program.

Outing  Club 

By  BARRY  STREET 

For  Montgomery  Bell  Academy, 
the  school  year  1979-80  brought  a 
new  headmaster,  a new  school  spirit, 
and  new  organizations.  One  such 
organization  was  the  Montgomery

students  joined.  By  the  end  of  the 
year,  the  club  numbered  7.1.  Those 
who  joined  enjoyed  weekends  in  the 
great  outdoors  rafting  the  Ocoee 
River,  backpacking  at  Fall  Creek 
Falls  State  Park  and  Savage  Gulf,

Cave,  skiing  in  Western  North 
Carolina,  and  canoeing  the 
Hiawasse  River.

together  an  even  more  exciting 
package  of  trips  which  include  fall, 
winter,  and  spring  backpacking 
trips,  skiing,  rafting,  and  caving.  (In 
general,  a guaranteed  good  time  to 
be  had  by  all  participants).  Ihc 
membership  fee  for  the  club  is$5.00 
for  the  whole  year  and  all  of  the  trips

imaginable.  All  ready  this  year.  79 
registration  forms  have  been  given 
out  to  those  eligible  (students  in 
grades  9-12).  If  you  don't  know  Mr. 
Womack,  or  have  any  questions, 
stop  by  and  see  him  in  the  art  room. 
We  await  another  fantastic  year  in 
the  wilderness.

By  TOM  WOOD 
Alter  a successful  1 1- 1 season  in 
1979.  this  year’s  varsity  football 
team  is  faced  with  the  prodigious 
challenge  of  bettering  that  record, 
lictorc  the  season  began,  I hr  Bell 
Kinger  talked  with  veteran  M B A 
Coach  lommy  Owen  about  the 
prospects  for  the  coming  campaign: 

Bell  Kinger  Will  the  pressure  of 
following  an  1 1 - 1 season  aflect  the 
team  adversely  or  beneficially? 

Coach  Owen:  I really  don't  think  it 

will  have  much  affect  When  they 
pick  teams  in  the  following  season 
they  tend  to  pick  them  based  on  what 
they  did  the  year  before,  but  I think 
certainly  this  team  is  unique  in  its 
own  character  and  I think  they're 
going  to  do  their  own  thing  and 
hopefully  it  will  be  a good  one. 

Bell  Ringer:  Last  year's  success  was 
due  largely  to  the  leadership  of  the 
seniors  and  team  unity.  How  would 
you  compare  this  team's  unity  and 
team  cohesiveness  to  last  year's 
team's? 


Brentwood  scrimmage  and  I think  it 
helped  mature  them.  He 
( Brentwood  quarterback  Kent 
Austin)  throws  the  ball  hard  and  has 
a quick  release  and  that’s  something 
we  haven't  seen  before. 

Bell  Kinger:  It  appears  that  you 

intend  to  platoon  more  this  year, 
especially  on  the  lines.  Is  that 
correct? 

Coach  Owen:  Our  offensive  and 

defensive  lines  are  different  except 
that  Brad  McKinney  plays  both 
ways,  and  Hartley  Hall  w ill  spell  him 
some  on  defense.  I think  it  helps 
some  when  your  defensive  people  a re 
a little  fresher.  I’d  like  to  platoon  all 
the  way.  but  I invariable  get  to  the 
point  where  I hate  to  see  some  of 
those  good  athletes  standing  on  the 
sidelines. 

Bell  Kinger:  With  the  aerial  threat 

posed  by  Tom  Moore.  Ricky 
Bowers,  and  Pavid  Pack  lost  to 
graduation,  and  with  a wealth  of 
talented  running  backs,  will  the  team 
rely  more  heavily  on  the  running 
game? 


pounds  and  this  year  only  three,  but 
overall  this  team  is  stronger.  I cam 
strength  is  a pretty  relative  thing. 
Sometimes  when  you  have  great 
strength,  you  don't  have  all  the 
mobility  orquicknesslhatyouneed. 
But  I've  been  most  pleased  with  our 
defensive  quickness  and  hopefully 
it's  going  to  get  better. 


contenders? 

C oach  Owen:  I think  this  team  has 

the  potential  for  a great  season.  A 
lot  depends  on  the  maturity  of  our 
senior  leadership  and  how  well  we 
can  prepare  them  each  week.

Drake  Looks 
To  State 

By  MARK  PEFFES 

The  Bell  Ringer  interviewed  coach 
Michael  Drake  and  teamed  that  the 
Cross  Country  team  is  planning  to 
win  the  slate  championship  this  fall. 
By  returning  five  of  seven  of  last 
year's  starters  who  helped  in  winning 
the  Nil  and  Regional 
championships  last  year.  Drake 
believes  this  goal  is  attainable. 

Coach  Drake  is  attempting  to 
achieve  this  by  hard  work  and 
determination.  He  stresses  that  each 
boy  must  want  to  win  badly  enough 
to  practice  hard  and  gain  the 
confidence  that  makes  a 
championship  team. 

Captain  Anderson  Spickanl  leads 
the  team  with  Allen  Moore.  Rich 
Ciood,  Steve  Stevens,  and  Walt 
Zibas  rounding  out  the  top  five.  The 
team  is  returning  12  lettermcn  and 
adding  five  ninth  graders  who  show 
much  potential.

MBA  VARSITY 


C oach  Owen:  We've  had  a lot  of 

young  players  on  the  field  in  the 
early  practices  and  I think  to  a 
degree  it’s  hampered  the  progress  of 
the  team  as  such,  but  I think  it's  been 
good  for  the  young  players  and  we're 
mighty  glad  to  have  them  in  the 
program. 

Bell  Kinger:  Whatsurpriscsdid the 

fall  d nils  yield  in  termsof  indiv  iduals 
performing  better  than  expected? 

Coach  Owen:  I don’t  know 

whether  there  have  been  any;  I have 
such  high  aspirations  for  players 
each  year  and  Itn  not  sure  I could 
pinpoint  anybody.  One  thing  that 
has  been  pleasant  has  been  the 
emergence  of  several  young  players 
at  positions  where  we  needed  help. 
At  safety,  where  Ricky  Bowers  is 
gone,  we've  had  completely  untried 
people  Hale  Hooper  was  making 
good  progrevs  there  and  banged  up  a 
knee  in  the  Springfield  scrimmage, 
and  now  Ken  Downey’s  stepped  in 
and  done  a pretty  good  job.  Our 
secondary  got  a good  workout  in  the 


( oach  Owen:  We\c  always  been 

primarily  a “run”  team— we  try  to 
run  65  percent  of  the  time  and  pass 
35  percent.  WcVc  got  some  very 
capable  passers  in  our  opening 
intrasquad  scrimmage  we  were  16 
for  26.  but  we  haven’t  thrown  well 
since  then.  We  have  five 
quarterbacks:  Scott  I unc  and  Tom 
DiViittorio  as  well  as  two 
sophomores,  and  a freshman.  Bobby 
Morales,  Ijcx  Harvey  and  Jeff  Uaw 
I think  by  the  end  of  the  season  all 
those  people  will  be  very  capable.

250-300  pound  range.  Is  this  the

How  much  of  an  edge  w ill  their  team 
strength  give  them  over  other  N.I.L.

( oach  Owen:  Yes.  I’d  say  overall  it 
is  the  strongest.  Last  year  we  had

Bell  Kinger.  What  teams  would 
you  say  pose  the  greatest  challenge 
to  the  team? 

Coach  Owen:  Certainly  our 
regular  big  rivals.  Ryan  and 
Overton,  and  the  district  games  will 
be  challenging,  but  really  the  biggest 
game  for  this  team  is  White’s  Creek, 
the  opener.  I think  sometimes  how 
well  you  play  in  that  game 
determines  your  mental  outlook  and 
we  want  to  go  out  there  Friday
