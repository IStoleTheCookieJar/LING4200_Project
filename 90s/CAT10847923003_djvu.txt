How  forecasts  are  made 

Most  of  the  annual  streamflow  in  the  Western  United  States  originates  as  snowfall  that 
has  accumulated  high  in  the  mountains  during  winter  and  early  spring.  As  the  snowpack 
accumulates,  hydrologists  estimate  the  runoff  that  will  occur  when  it  melts.  Predictions  are 
based  on  careful  measurements  of  snow  water  equivalent  at  selected  index  points. 
Precipitation,  temperature,  soil  moisture  and  antecedent  streamflow  data  are  combined  with 
snowpack  data  to  prepare  runoff  forecasts.  Streamflow  forecasts  are  coordinated  by  Soii 
Conservation  Service  and  National  Weather  Service  hydrologists.  This  report  presents  a 
comprehensive  picture  of  water  suppiy  conditions  for  areas  dependent  upon  surface  runoff. 

It  includes  selected  streamflow  forecasts,  summarized  snowpack  and  precipitation  data, 
reservoir  storage  data,  and  narratives  describing  current  conditions. 

Snowpack  data  are  obtained  by  using  a combination  of  manual  and  automated  SNOTEL 
measurement  methods.  Manual  readings  of  snow  depth  and  water  equivalent  are  taken  at  j 
locations  called  snow  courses  on  a monthly  or  semi-monthly  schedule  during  the  winter.  In 
addition,  snow  water  equivalent,  precipitation  and  temperature  are  monitored  on  a daily  basis 
and  transmitted  via  meteor  burst  telemetry  to  central  data  collection  facilities.  Both  monthly  | 
and  daily  data  are  used  to  project  snowmelt  runoff. 

Forecast  uncertainty  originates  from  two  sources:  (1)  uncertainty  of  future  hydrologic  and 
climatic  conditions,  and  (2)  error  in  the  forecasting  procedure.  To  express  the  uncertainty  in 
the  most  probable  forecast,  four  additional  forecasts  are  provided.  The  actual  streamflow 
can  be  expected  to  exceed  the  most  probable  forecast  50%  of  the  time.  Similarly,  the  actual 
streamflow  volume  can  be  expected  to  exceed  the  90%  forecast  volume  90%  of  the  time.  The 
same  is  true  for  the  70%,  30%,  and  10%  forecasts.  Generally,  the  90%  and  70%  forecasts 
reflect  drier  than  normal  hydrologic  and  climatic  conditions;  the  30%  and  10%  forecasts 
reflect  wetter  than  normal  conditions.  As  the  forecast  season  progresses,  a greater  portion 
of  the  future  hydrologic  and  climatic  uncertainty  will  become  known  and  the  additional 
forecasts  will  move  closer  to  the  most  probable  forecast.

Washington 
Water  Supply  Outlook 

March  1993 


General  Outlook 

MARCH  1,  1993:  Major  changes  in  the  weather  have  occurred  since  the 
first  of  January,  with  cold  and  dry  being  the  norm.  February 
precipitation  was  20%  of  normal  state  wide,  and  varied  from  56%  of 
average  in  the  Walla  Walla  Basin  to  5%  in  the  North  Puget  Basin. 
Year-to-date  precipitation  varies  from  88%  in  the  Walla  Walla  to  61% 
in  the  North  Puget  Basin.  Forecasts  for  1993  runoff  vary  from  106%  of 
average  for  the  Grande  Ronde  River  to  59%  for  the  Similkameen  River. 
The  snowpack  varies  from  57%  in  the  Olympic  Basin  to  122%  in  the  Walla 
Walla  Basin.  Washington  SNOTEL  sites  averaged  86%  of  normal  snowpack 
on  March  1,  Down  from  105%  on  February  1 (By  March  8,  the  statewide 
average  was  87%) . February  temperatures  were  below  normal  and  varied 
from  one  degree  below  in  the  White-Green  Basin  to  11  degrees  below  in 
the  Walla  Walla  Basin.  With  the  below  normal  temperatures  in  February, 
streamflows  varied  from  91%  of  normal  on  the  Kettle  River  to  21%  on 
the  Walla  Walla  River.  March  1 reservoir  storage  is  generally  poor 
throughout  the  state,  with  reservoirs  in  the  Yakima  Basin  at  38%  of 
average  and  25%  of  capacity. 


Snowpack 

The  March  1 SNOTEL  reading  showed  the  snowpack  to  be  86%  of  average. 
Snowpack  continues  to  vary  over  the  state.  The  Colville  River  Basin 
had  108%  of  average,  and  the  Walla  Walla  Basin  had  the  highest  with 
122%  of  normal.  The  North  Puget  River  Basins  had  62%  of  average.  The 
Olympic  Peninsula  rivers  were  the  lowest  with  57%  of  normal.  Snowpack 
along  the  east  slopes  of  the  Cascade  Mountains  includes  the  Yakima 
with  76%  down  from  95%  last  month,  and  the  Wenatchee  73%,  down  from 
89%.  Snowpack  in  the  Okanogan  is  at  85%,  down  from  98%,  and  the 
Spokane  Basin  at  90%,  down  from  108%.  Maximum  snow  cover  is  at 
Paradise  on  Mount  Rainier,  with  a water  content  of  45.2  inches.  This 
site  would  normally  have  47.9  inches  of  water  content  on  March  1. 


Precipitation 

February  precipitation  reported  from  National  Weather  Service  stations 
was  20%  of  average  statewide.  The  year-to-date  precipitation 
statewide  is  72%  and  varied  from  88%  of  normal  in  the  Walla  Walla 
Basin,  to  61%  in  the  North  Puget  Basin.  February  precipitation  varied 
from  5%  of  average  in  the  North  Puget  Basin,  to  88%  in  the  Walla  Walla 
Basin.  SNOTEL  sites  in  Washington  showed  high  elevation  year-to-date 
precipitation  values  to  be  72%.  Maximum  year-to-date  precipitation 
was  at  the  June  Lake  SNOTEL  site  near  Mt.  St.  Helens,  with  75.1  inches 
since  October  1,  1992;  normal  for  this  site  is  99.4  inches. 


Reservoir 


Reservoir  storage  in  Washington  is  much  below  average  for  March  1. 
Cold  weather  has  reduced  the  streamflow  entering  the  reservoirs. 
Reservoir  storage  in  the  Yakima  Basin  was  261,500  acre  feet,  38%  of 
normal.  Storage  at  other  reservoirs  include  Roosevelt  at  94%  of 
average,  and  the  Okanogan  reservoirs  at  92%  of  normal  for  March  1 . 
The  power  generation  reservoirs  contain  the  following:  Coeur  d'Alene 
Lake,  39,600  acre  feet,  or  27%  of  normal;  Chelan  Lake,  160,500  acre 
feet,  95%  of  average  and  24%  of  capacity,  and  Ross  Lake  at  197%  of 
average,  and  43%  of  capacity. 


Streamflow 

February  streamflows  were  below  average  in  Washington.  The  Kettle 
River  at  91%  was  the  highest  and  the  South  Fork  Walla  Walla  River  with 
21%,  was  the  lowest  in  the  state.  Other  streamflows  were  the 
following  percentage  of  normal:  the  Lewis  River,  28%;  the  Okanogan 
River,  61%;  the  Spokane  River,  36%;  the  Columbia  at  the  Canadian 
border,  64%,.  and  the  Yakima  River  at  Kiona,  47%.  Forecasts  for 
summer  streamflow  are  for  much  below-to-near  average  and  vary  from 
106%  of  average  for  the  Grande  Ronde  River  to  59%  of  normal  for  the 
Similkameen  River.  March  forecasts  for  some  west  side  streams 
include:  Cedar  River,  83%;  Green  River,  81%;  and  the  Dungeness  River, 
75%.  Some  east  side  streams  include  the  Yakima  River  at  Parker,  67%; 
the  Stemilt,  83%;  the  Chelan  River,  70%  and  the  Colville  River,  81%.

CONSERVE  YOUR  IRRIGATION  WATER 


i i Can  irrigators  use  less  water  and  get 

I good  yields?  We  think  so.  With 
(energy  costs  on  an  upward  spiral  and 
water  shortages  likely,  we  offer  these 
water  saving  ideas  to  irrigators. 

•I,  Consider  ditch  lining  or  gated  pipe. 
liThis  will  reduce  the  10-90%  loss  which 
i: occurs  in  earth  ditches. 

'Keep  ditches  clean  and  free  from 
|i weeds,  sediment  or  other  debris,  which 
|(can  slow  water  velocity,  affect 
(delivery  rate,  and  increase 
|(  evaporation. 

II Make  sure  head  gates,  drop  structures, 
[|:and  pipe  inlets  are  operational.  A 
^jii washed  out  structure  is  water  lost. 

i : 

1 1 Inspect  ditch  banks  for  rodent 
ic damage.  Rodent  holes  cause  leakage  or 
; I failures. 

;fMake  sure  sprinkler  nozzles  are  not 
inworn  or  leaky.  Check  pipe  connections 
irnd  valves  to  prevent  leaks. 

[C  Operate  sprinklers  at  recommended 
{pressure  to  effectively  use  available 
K water. 

I Maintain  your  pump  at  peak  efficiency 
tto  save  energy. 

BETTER  WATER  MANAGEMENT 
(Better  water  management  may  require 
nmore  labor.  It  may  require  changing  a 
(head  of  water  in  the  middle  of  the 
might.  But  it  will  be  worth  it.  You 
(should: 

(Measure  your  water  to  determine  how 
smuch  is  applied. 

|(Consider  alternate  row  irrigation  for 
(crops  planted  in  furrows. 

(Plan  short  runs.  Match  stream  size 
jand  velocity  to  soil  intake  rate  and 
(capacity. 

CCatch  and  reuse  tail  water  where 
{possible. 


Under  irrigate  the  lower  end  of  the 
field  to  stretch  your  water. 


When  water  is  short,  consider 
eliminating  that  last  irrigation. 

Soil  Conservation  Service  personnel 
can: 

Help  plan  and  design  new  irrigation 
systems  or  evaluate  existing  ones. 
Provide  technical  assistance  for  land 
leveling,  pipeline  installation,  and 
other  practices. 


KNOW  YOUR  SOILS 

Soil  absorbs  irrigation  water  at  a 
given  rate.  This  varies  with  each 
soil  type.  Some  crops  require  more 
water  than  others.  Check  soil 
moisture  by  spade,  probe,  or  moisture 
meter.  Or  use  the  "feel"  method. 


WHEN  IRRIGATION  IS  NEEDED 
SOIL  WILL  FEEL  AND  ACT  THIS  WAY 


Soil  Texture 

A handful  of  soil  will 

Coarse 

Tend  to  stick  together 
slightly,  but  will  not 
form  a ball 

Medium 

Be  crumbly,  but  will 
form  a ball 

Fine 

be  pliable,  and  will 
form  a ball. 

If  you  have  a conservation  plan  on 
your  farm,  or  if  the  soil  is  your  area 
has  been  mapped,  the  Soil  Conservation 
Service  can  crosscheck  soil  type  and 
irrigation  data  and  provide  you  with 
the  water  holding  capacity  of  your 
soil  for  a given  crop. 


RANCHING  TIPS  FOR  WATER-SHORT  YEARS 


Forage  production  on  range  and  dry 
pasture  depends  entirely  on  natural 
moisture.  While  overgrazing  does 
damage  to  perennial  plants  during  a 
season  of  normal  moisture,  it  is 
more  severe  during  a drought  year. 
It  reduces  plant  vigor,  stops  root 
and  leaf  growth,  reduces  ground 
cover,  and  invites  accelerated 
erosion.  Once  erosion  begins,  it 
gets  worse  each  year,  further 
reducing  plant  vigor  and  forage 
production.  This  process  is 
difficult  to  reverse. 

Rather  than  risk  permanent  damage 
to  grazing  resources  start  planning 
a strategy  early.  For  example: 

reduce  livestock  numbers  to 
balance  with  forage  supply 

- cull  herds  more  than  normal 

- sell  calves  and  lambs  early 

determine  forage  needs  and  buy 

needed  supplements  early 

- grow  small  grains  or  sorghums 
for  hay  or  pasture  (these  use  less 
water  than  conventional  forage 
crops) 

defer  planting  perennial 
pasture,  hay  or  range  seedings 
until  a year  with  more  favorable 
water  outlook 

- keep  spring  developments,  stock 
tanks,  float  valves  and  pipeline  in 
good  working  order  so  water  is  not 
wasted 

- use  evaporation  retardant  on 
ponds  and  tanks 

- prepare  for  hauling  stock  water 

- give  spring  development  high 
priority  (even  mediocre  springs 
will  be  helpful) 

- check  with  local  SCS  and  ASCS 
offices  to  learn  if  cost-share 
programs  are  available  to  help  with 
spring  developments  or  other  water 
conservation  practices 

- don't  overgraze  or  otherwise 
disturb  streambank  vegetation  (it 
will  help  prevent  erosion,  reduce 
sediment,  and  provide  food  and 
cover  for  wildlife) 


Remember,  if  a unit  must  be 
abused,  well-established  seedings 
can  tolerate  overgrazing  better 
than  native  range. 

Wildlife  will  suffer  during  a 
drought  as  much  or  more  than 
domestic  livestock.  The  wildlife 
that  share  your  land  is  a valuable 
natural  resource. 

To  help  wildlife: 

- include  features  at  stock  water 
developments  which  will  allow  small 
animals  and  birds  safe  access  to 
water  (these  are  usually  not 
expensive  and  are  easily  installed) 

- fence  ponds  and  springs  and 
install  collector  pipes  to  deliver 
water  to  a tank  or  trough.  This 
will  improve  water  quality  and 
quantity  for  livestock,  as  well  as 
provide  lush  vegetation  for  small 
animals  and  birds. 

Other  places  for  information  or 
assistance: 

- check  with  local  ASCS  office 
for  possible  special  practices  or 
cost-sharing  that  might  assist  with 
irrigation  on  your  farm  or  ranch 
this  year. 

- maintain  contact  with  Farmers 
Home  Administration  for  special 
local  programs  available. 

- maintain  contact  with  the  local 
Cooperative  Extension  Service 
office  for  agricultural  and 
marketing  conditions. 

If  you  belong  to  an  irrigation 
district,  contact  irrigation 
officials  throughout  the  season  to 
learn  about  current  water 
availability  and  water  supply 
forecasts. 

For  more  information  concerning 
your  crop,  and  soil  and  water 
conditions,  contact  the  local 
Conservation  District  Office.

February  precipitation  was  12%  of  normal  and  65%  for  the  water  year  to 
date.  March  1 reservoir  storage  for  the  five  major  reservoirs  at 
261,800  acre  feet,  was  38%  of  average.  Temperatures  were  eight 
degrees  below  average  for  February.  March  1 summer  streamflow 
forecasts  for  the  Yakima  Basin  vary  throughout  the  basin  as  follows: 
The  Yakima  River  at  Cle  Elum,  70%;  Naches  River,  72%;  the  Yakima  River 
at  Parker,  67%,  Ahtanum  Creek,  71%,  and  the  Tieton  River  71%. 

February  streamflows  were  very  low,  with  the  Yakima  River  at  Parker 
47%  of  normal,  48%  for  the  Yakima  near  Cle  Elum,  and  29%  for  the 
Naches  River.  March  1 snowpack  is  76%  of  average,  down  from  95%  last 
month.  The  snowpack  is  based  upon  18  snow  courses  and  SNOTEL  readings. 
Volume  forecasts  for  the  Yakima  Basin  are  for  natural  flow.  As  such, 
they  may  differ  from  the  U.  S.  Bureau  of  Reclamation's  forecast  for 
the  total  water  supply  available  which  includes  irrigation  return 
flow.
