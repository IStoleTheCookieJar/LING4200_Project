Dairy Plants 
Surveyed and 
Approved for USDA 
Grading Service 





July 1991 





PREFACE 


The dairy plants listed in this publication are inspected periodically by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA has two types of dairy plant 
approvals. Those operations denoted with "P" codes (packaging and processing) 
have only partial approval, and the resulting products may not be officially 
graded. (See pp. 24 - 26 for further details.) All other product codes--B, 
C, F, D, M, S, and W--denote products that are eligible for official grading 
service. Plant approval for grading service does not constitute an 
endorsement of product quality; however, such assurance could be achieved by 
official grading to meet a U.S. grade standard or a quality specification of 
the buyer or seller. 


Plant approval is determined by unannounced inspections, conducted at least 
twice yearly and covering more than 100 items, including milk supply, plant 
facilities, condition of equipment, sanitary practices, and processing 
procedures. The inspection criteria are outlined in "General Specifications 
for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service" (7 CFR 
58.101 to 58.938) administered by the Dairy Division of USDA's Agricultural 
Marketing Service (AMS). 


The USDA plant inspection program is widely used by the dairy industry. Plant 
managers recognize it as an important means for improving and maintaining a 
sound operation for producing dairy products that will meet specific grade or 
contract requirements and that have the uniform quality essential for buyer 
and consumer approval and protection. Buyers also find this program a 
reliable guide to sources for dependable dairy products. 


The Dairy Grading Branch of the AMS, Dairy Division also provides service 
under its resident grading and quality control service. Plants using this 
service are shown in this publication with an asterisk. This full-time 
program offers on-the-spot official grading of the plant's manufactured 
products, laboratory testing and quality control, and plant inspection 
services. The resident program also makes available to the plant manager the 
technical know-how and experience of the Dairy Grading Branch's supervisory 
staff for help in solving product quality problems. 


Plant inspection services and the Resident Grading and Quality Control Program 
are available on a voluntary basis, and fees are charged to cover costs. 
Managers of dairy plants or other interested persons may obtain information 
about these services by contacting the National Field Office of the Dairy 
Grading Branch in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. 


Plants listed in this publication are identified by State-assigned code 
numbers (where available) in accordance with the national uniform coding 
system known as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards). Each State 
has been assigned a two-digit number which appears in this publication 
before the name of the State. The State-assigned plant number identifying 
the plant precedes the plant name. 


This publication is revised every three months to reflect changes in plant 
approval and to include new plants. 


USDA inspection and grading services are performed under the "Regulations 
Governing the Inspection and Grading Services of Manufactured or Processed 
Deairyercoducts,;u mse GER. 06; 16to 26.603. 


NOTICE TO USDA APPROVED PLANTS RECEIVING CREAM 


The General Specifications for Approved Plants and Standards for Grades of 
Dairy Products, Section 58.101(d), published October 10, 1975, requires 
approved plants to "receive dairy products only from plants, transfer 
stations, receiving stations, and cream buying stations which satisfactorily 
comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart as determined by the 
Administrator." 


With the exception of plants supplying cream to USDA approved plants, we have 
applied this requirement uniformly. The exception was granted to permit the 
use of farm separated cream at USDA approved facilities. It was determined to 
be unfair to require cream source approval as there is no manageable or 
equitable way to inspect facilities shipping farm separated cream. On 

August 27, 1985, the General Specifications were amended to delete the 
references that permitted farm separated cream to be received by dairy plants 
surveyed and approved for USDA grading service. As a result of this 
amendment, approval of the remaining cream sources can be accomplished as 
equitably as for all other dairy product sources. The continued absence of 
approved cream sources is an unjustifiable inconsistency in the inspection 
requirements which we propose to correct. 


Therefore, in order to apply our plant survey requirements uniformly to all 
segments of the industry, the Dairy Grading Branch will require that all 
suppliers of cream to USDA approved plants be inspected and/or approved by the 
Dairy Grading Branch, Dairy Division, AMS, USDA. In order to prevent 
duplication of inspection, cream supplies originating from plants acceptable 
to the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (NCIMS) and other 
regularly inspected Grade A sources will be acceptable without additional USDA 
inspection. 


Full USDA implementation of this requirement will not become effective until 
July 1, 1991, allowing plants not currently USDA approved to become familiar 
with the USDA requirements and, if necessary, modify their current practices 
and facilities. After July 1, 1991, plants which continue to receive cream 
from unapproved sources will be assigned the Ineligible USDA status. 


To receive copies of the General Specifications for Approved Plants and 
Standards for Grades of Dairy Products or to request a USDA inspection to 
determine USDA plant status please contact:

NOTICE TO USDA APPROVED PLANTS 


Pasteurization of dairy products in properly designed, operated and sealed 
pasteurization systems is vital to assure the public health safety of most 
dairy products. For this reason, the Dairy Grading Branch has required 
pasteurization of applicable dairy products in dairy plants which are surveyed 
and approved for USDA grading service. 


During the development and implementation of membrane processing technology in 
the dairy industry, pasteurization has been required for all membrane 
processed products except RO concentrated whey (W19) when it was declared to 
be used for further processing. 


Public, industry, and USDA concerns for food safety issues initiated a 
reevaluation by the Dairy Grading Branch of this pasteurization exception for 
RO concentrated whey (W19). Technological advances in membrane processing 
have minimized the detrimental effects of pasteurization on product 
functionality. 


Effective July 1, 1991, pasteurization will be required for all dairy plants 
producing RO whey concentrate (W19) which are surveyed and approved for USDA 
grading service by the Dairy Grading Branch.

SECTION II: 


LISTING OF PLANTS WHICH HAVE PROCESSING 
OR PACKAGING OPERATIONS THAT 
MEET USDA REQUIREMENTS FOR 
FACILITIES AND SANITATION 


23 


Codes shown below denote processing or packaging operations that meet USDA 
requirements for facilities and sanitation. Approval is limited to the desig- 
nated kind of operation. Approval does not constitute eligibility for grading 
of finished products unless the bulk dairy products or dairy ingredients for 
packaging or processing are made by a USDA-approved plant. (See pp. 1 - 3 for 
codes indicating which products are eligible for USDA grading.) 


If official inspection or grading service will be required on a "P" code 
product, contact the USDA National Field Director before the product is 
manufactured. Arrangements are needed for assurance that dairy ingredients 
were made by a USDA-approved plant. 


*Plants approved for codes marked with a single asterisk are subscribing to 
the USDA Salmonella surveillance program, which monitors plant control by 
quarterly USDA sampling and testing of environmental samples, together with an 
established system of follow-up in the event of a positive result. This 
Salmonella surveillance program is limited to the testing of only 
environmental samples because products manufactured by "P" code plants may be’ 
produced with dairy ingredients from unapproved sources. Plant management may 
request Salmonella analysis of a plant's "P" code production provided that 
such production is produced under continuous USDA inspection. While this USDA 
monitoring implies a certain degree of safety, the relatively low level of 
official testing does not ensure the absence of Salmonella organisms in 
products manufactured in USDA-approved operations. 


**Manufactured from vegetable oil. (Margarine made with animal fat 
ingredients is under the inspection of Meat and Poultry Inspection Operations, 
Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.)

LABORATORY SERVICE 


Within AMS, the Science Division bears the responsibility for performing or 
coordinating the performance of laboratory analyses. AMS laboratory testing 
service for dairy and related products is available, upon request, to any 
plant, industry, or private organization that wants its products analyzed. 


Samples may be sent directly without prearrangement, but should be accompanied 
by a request listing the tests desired and the name and address of the firm or 
person to be billed for the service. Upon request, results will be telephoned 
collect as soon as analyses are completed. The request should specify the 
telephone number and person to contact. 


To request laboratory services and a schedule of the fees associated with 
product testing, contact:
