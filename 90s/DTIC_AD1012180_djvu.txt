Exposure  to  nicotine  in  utero  results  in  a  wide  array  of  physical, 
behavioral,  and  cognitive  effects  on  the  offspring.  Some  of  these  effects  are 
evident  at  birth  and  some  do  not  appear  until  later  in  life.  In  the  present 
experiment,  pregnant  female  Sprague-Dawley  rats  were  administered  nicotine  {6 
or  12  mg/kg/day)  or  saline  via  osmotic  minipump  chronically  throughout 
pregnancy  and  the  offspring  were  examined  during  adolescence  and  adulthood 
for  changes  in  body  weight,  radial-arm  and  water  maze  performance,  passive 
avoidance  performance,  acoustic  startle  reactivity,  pre-pulse  inhibition,  locomotor 
activity,  and  dopamine  D1  receptor  binding  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex. 

Effects  of  prenatal  nicotine  exposure  depended  on  nicotine  dosage,  the  sex  and 

iii 


age  of  the  subject.  Specifically,  females  and  males  that  had  been  exposed  to 
the  highest  dose  of  nicotine  in  utero  weighed  less  than  the  other  offspring 
throughout  the  experiment.  These  females  also  made  more  mistakes  on  the 
radial-arm  maze  and  were  less  active  during  adolescent  testing  than  the  other 
females.  When  tested  in  adulthood,  the  females  that  had  been  exposed  to 
6  mg/kg/day  nicotine  showed  enhanced  pre-pulse  inhibition  (an  index  of  sensory 
gating).  Adolescent  males  that  had  been  exposed  to  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine  took 
longer  to  complete  the  water  maze  task,  but  were  more  active  than  the  other 
adolescent  males.  When  tested  as  adults,  males  that  had  been  exposed  to 
either  dosage  of  nicotine  performed  more  poorly  than  non-drug-exposed  males 
on  the  radial-arm  maze  (they  made  fewer  correct  choices  before  an  error  was 
made  and  took  longer  to  complete  the  task)  and  showed  impaired  pre-pulse 
inhibition.  However,  these  same  males  showed  enhanced  passive  avoidance 
iearning.  Dopamine  D1  receptors  of  either  sex  were  not  significantly  affected  by 
prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine.  In  summary,  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine 
resulted  in  physically  smaller  offspring,  impaired  spatial  memory  performance, 
and  mixed  results  on  non-spatial  memory,  pre-pulse  inhibition,  and  locomotor 
activity  without  affecting  the  D1  receptor  system  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex. 
Implications  of  these  findings  with  regard  to  previous  work  in  animals  and 
relevance  to  human  smoking  during  pregnancy  are  discussed.

Acknowledgments 

A  document  of  this  magnitude  (relatively  speaking)  is  not  created  in  a 
vacuum.  My  deepest  debt  of  gratitude  goes  to  my  advisor  Neil  Grunberg,  Ph.D., 
for  his  guidance,  concern,  effort,  and  forbearance  in  this  process.  He  is  a  true 
mentor  and  scholar.  1  would  bo  like  to  thank  Martha  M.  Faraday  for  everything, 
for  things  too  numerous  and  intangible  to  mention  here  and  I  didn’t  even  “turn  on 
her.”  The  guidance  of  my  committee  (John  Sarvey,  Ph.D.,  Sharon  Juliano, 

Ph.D.,  Linda  Porter,  Ph.D.,  and  Tracy  Sbrocco,  Ph.D.)  was  indispensable  in  the 
design  and  running  of  the  experiment  (both  of  them).  The  firm  leadership  of  the 
Neuroscience  Program  Chair,  Cinda  Helke,  Ph.D.,  was  crucial  for  keeping  me  on 
deadlines  and  I  thank  her  whole-heartedly  for  that.  Dr.  Jerome  E.  Singer  allowed 
me  to  "live"  and  work  in  his  department  during  my  entire  tenure  at  USUHS  and  I 
greatly  appreciate  it.  I  thank  Dr.  Michael  Sheridan,  Dean  of  Graduate  Education, 
and  Janet  Anastasi  for  their  stalwart  and  unflagging  support  of  the  graduate 
program  and  its  students  —  not  an  easy  task  in  what  a  past  colleague  of  mine 
described  as  essentially  an  environment  for  medical  students.  And  finally  I 
would  like  to  thank  my  mother  Noel  and  my  father  Jim,  who  in  their  separate 
ways  never  ceased  in  their  support  of  my  many  many  years  of  scholastic 
endeavor.  I  could  not  have  done  this  without  you  all!

Introduction 


Cigarette  smoking  during  pregnancy  results  in  pathophysiologic 
consequences  in  children,  including  spontaneous  abortion,  fetal  resorption, 
reduced  birth  weight,  and  weakened  physical  condition  (CDC,  1994a;  CDC, 

1995;  Levin  et  al„  1998).  In  addition  to  these  hazards,  epidemiologic 
investigations  have  suggested  that  children  of  smoking  mothers  have  decreased 
learning  and  cognitive  abilities  as  well  as  increased  hyperactivity  and  conduct 
disorders  (Levin  et  al.,  1998).  Because  these  human  studies  are  correlational 
causality  of  tobacco  or  any  of  its  key  constituents  (most  importantly,  nicotine) 
cannot  be  determined.  Animal  models  have  proven  to  be  valuable  in  the 
investigation  of  causal  contributions  of  nicotine  to  behavioral  and  cognitive 
effects  (e.g.,  Grunberg  et  al.,  1991;  Slotkin,  1992).  Animal  studies  (mostly  using 
rats  and  mice)  have  reported  that  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  results  in 
offspring  that  show:  1)  decreased  learning  abilities  (Genedani  et  al.,  1983;  Martin 
et  al.,  1971);  2)  decreased  cognitive  {e.g.,  memory  performance)  abilities  (e.g., 
Levin,  1993a);  3)  increased  activity  (Richardson  et  al.,  1994);  and  4)  altered 
brain  development  including,  alterations  in  gene  expression  (Slotkin  et  al,,  1997), 
receptor  densities  (Fung  et  al.,  1989;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987a),  and  general 
alterations  in  overall  brain  development  (Lichtensteiger  et  al.,  1988). 
Unfortunately,  these  experiments  have  several  methodologic  limitations: 

1)  routes  of  administration  have  included  several  techniques  that  are  not 
appropriate  models  of  exposure  to  nicotine  or  tobacco  (e.g.,  nicotine  in  drinking 
water,  oral  gavage  of  smokeless  tobacco  extract);  2)  dosages  of  nicotine  via 


1 


2 


osmotic  minipump  (an  appropriate  model  for  nicotine  exposure)  have  been  lower 
than  dosages  that  mimic  nicotine  exposure  that  human  fetuses  experience  {e.g., 
0.1,  0.2,  0.5,  1 .0  and  up  to  6.0  mg/kg/day  as  opposed  to  6.0  - 12.0  mg/kg/day) 
(Winders  et  al.,  1998);  and  3)  cognitive,  behavioral,  and  neural  effects  have  not 
been  examined  within  the  same  offspring.  The  purpose  of  this  dissertation 
research  was  to  fill  these  gaps  by  examining  effects  of  prenatal  exposure  to 
appropriate  dosages  of  nicotine,  during  adolescence  and  adulthood,  on  cognitive 
performance,  behavior  and  activity,  sensory  gating,  and  dopamine  receptor 
binding  in  relevant  brain  areas,  within  the  same  male  and  female  offspring. 

This  dissertation  begins  by  discussing  background  information  on  the 
effects  of  cigarette  smoking  during  pregnancy  in  humans:  the  prevalence,  the 
effects  on  children,  and  costs  to  society.  Next  follows  a  discussion  of  what  has 
been  discovered  using  prenatal  nicotine  administration  in  animals,  including 
effects  on  working  memory  with  particular  attention  to  animal  models  of  memory 
performance.  The  Introduction  ends  with  a  discussion  of  the  physical  chemistry 
of  dopamine  and  nicotine  and  their  associated  receptor  systems.  The  Methods 
section  delineates  exactly  how  the  experiment  was  performed  and  analyzed. 

The  Results  section  presents  the  findings  of  this  experiment.  These  findings 
reveal  that:  nicotine  administration  during  pregnancy  results  in  altered  cognitive 
and  behavioral  abilities;  these  changes  are  complex  and  are  revealed  at  different 
times  in  the  life  span;  these  changes  are  dependent  upon  the  sex  of  the 
offspring;  and  altered  cognitive  and  behavioral  abilities  are  not  associated  with 
changes  in  neurochemical  receptors  in  the  specific  area  of  the  brain  examined.

Cigarette  Smoking  During  Pregnancy  in  Humans 

Prevalence 

Tobacco  use  remains  the  leading  preventable  cause  of  death  in  the 
United  States,  causing  more  than  400,000  deaths  each  year  and  resulting  in 
more  than  $50  billion  in  direct  medical  costs  (CDC,  1994b).  More  than  48  million 
Americans  adults  smoke  (61  million  including  those  under  age  18),  22.7  million 
of  them  adult  women  of  child-bearing  age  (CDC,  1 995;  USDHHS,  1 996). 
Cigarette  smoking  by  pregnant  females  has  serious  negative  behavioral, 
cognitive,  and  health  effects  in  offspring.  Whereas  the  incidence  of  smoking  in 
the  general  population  has  decreased  25%  in  recent  years  (CDC,  1994a;  1965- 
1994,  Mactutus,  1989),  smoking  among  females  has  increased  (CDC,  1995; 
USDHHS,  1996).  Smoking  among  females  of  child-bearing  age  has  been 
reported  to  be  as  high  as  25-33%  in  recent  years  (Levin  et  al.,  1998;  Levin  et  al., 
1996b;  Slotkin,  1998;  USDHHS,  1988;  USDHHS,  1996).  Among  females  of 
lower  socio-economic  status  (SES)  the  prevalence  of  smoking  is  even  higher 
(Bardy  et  al.,  1 994).  Although  pregnant  woman  commonly  report  decreases  in 
or  cessation  of  smoking  behavior  during  pregnancy  (Pricker  et  at.,  1985;  Stewart 
et  al.,  1985;  Streissguth  et  al.,  1983),  biochemical  markers  of  cigarette  smoking 
measured  in  maternal  and  fetal  blood  indicate  high  prevalence  of  smoking  by  the 
mothers.  For  example,  Ptey  and  colleagues  (1 991 )  reported  significant 
discrepancies  between  self-report  data  and  carboxy-hemoglobin  levels.  Bardy 
and  colleagues  (1 993)  found  that  38%  of  women  who  had  reported  being  non- 
smokers  during  pregnancy  had  cotinine  (the  primary  metabolite  of  nicotine)  in 


4 

their  blood  at  levels  similar  to  those  women  who  reported  that  they  continued 
smoking. 

Effects  on  Children 

Cigarette  smoking  during  pregnancy  can  result  in:  increased  infant 
mortality  and  decreased  birth  weight  (Aronson  et  al.,  1993;  Brooke  et  al.,  1989; 
Eliopoulos  et  al..  1996;  Morrison  et  al.,  1993;  Picone  et  al.,  1982);  reduced 
APGAR  scores  (Drage  et  al.,  1966a;  Drage  et  al.,  1966b):  learning  impairment 
(Butler  et  al.,  1973;  Dunn  et  al.,  1977;  Hardy  et  al.,  1972);  cognitive  deficits 
(Dunn  et  al.,  1977;  Rantakallio,  1983);  attentiona!  and  conduct  deficits  including 
attention  deficit  disorder  (ADD)  and  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder 
(ADHD)  (Denson  et  al.,  1975;  Naeye  et  al.,  1984;  Streissguth,  1984);  poor 
impulse  control  (Fergusson  et  al.,  1993;  Kristjansson  et  al.,  1989);  impaired 
attention  and  orientation  (Landesman-Dwyer  et  al.,  1979;  Picone  et  al.,  1982; 
Streissguth  et  al.,  1983);  poor  vigilance  performance  and  decreased  reaction 
time  performance  (Kristjansson  et  al.,  1989);  and  hyperactivity  without  attention  al 
deficits  (Denson  et  al.,  1975). 

These  effects  can  be  long  lasting  and  may  be  permanent.  Denson  and 
colleagues  (1975)  reported  that  mothers  of  hyperkinetic  elementary-school-aged 
children  smoked  more  than  mothers  of  nonhyperkinetic  age-matched  control  or 
dyslexic  children.  In  a  study  examining  452  four-year-old  children  in  Seattle, 
Streissguth  and  colleagues  (1 984)  reported  impaired  attention  and  orientation  in 
children  whose  mothers  reported  that  they  smoked  during  pregnancy.  Fried  and 
colleagues  (1989)  reported  that  three-year-old  children  of  smoking  mothers  had 


5 


impaired  verbal  memory  and  impaired  general  cognitive  performance  on  the 
McCarthy  Scale  of  Children’s  Abilities.  Later.  Fried  and  colleagues  (1992) 
Identified  deficits  in  cognitive  and  receptive  language  abilities  in  136  five-year-old 
and  137  six-year-old  children  of  smoking  mothers.  Additionally,  in  a  follow-up 
study  of  127  six-year-old  children,  Fried  (1992)  reported  significant  deficits  in 
verbal  memory,  increased  impulsive  behavior  which  lead  to  deficits  on  response 
inhibition  tasks  and  increased  errors  of  commission  on  sustained  vigilance  tasks. 
Hyperactivity  and  impaired  visual  and  auditory  vigilance  performance  (increased 
errors  of  commission  and  impulsive  responding)  has  also  been  reported  in 
children  4-7  years  old  (Kristjansson  et  al.,  1989)  and  in  auditory  processing  in 
1 1 0  children  6-1 1  years  old  {McCartney  et  al.,  1 994).  Dunn  and  colleagues 
{1976;  1977)  reported  effects  of  maternal  smoking  on  children  aged  6Vz  on  both 
physical  development,  stature,  and  intellectual  development  (1977). 

Additionally,  maternal-smoking-related  hyperactivity  has  been  significantly 
associated  with  increased  conduct  disorders  in  1265  children  followed  from  birth 
to  age  15  in  New  Zealand  (Fergusson  et  al.,  1993)  and  in  177  boys  aged  7-12 
in  a  6-year  longitudinal  study  conducted  in  Chicago  {Wakschlag  et  al.,  1997).  In 
another  long-term  study,  Fogelman  and  Manor  (1 988)  reported  that  while 
maternal-smoking-related  deficits  in  height  were  found  in  boys  but  not  girls  by 
age  1 6,  deficits  in  overall  intellectual  achievement  were  still  found  in  both  sexes 
at  age  23.  Perhaps  even  more  disturbing,  in  an  Atlanta  study  examining  221 
children  diagnosed  with  idiopathic  mental  retardation  and  400  control  children, 
Drews  and  colleagues  (1996)  reported  that  children  whose  mothers  smoked  at 


6 


least  one  pack  a  day  during  pregnancy  had  more  than  a  75%  increase  in  the 
occurrence  of  idiopathic  mental  retardation,  even  when  controlling  for  potential 
confounds  such  as  maternal  age  at  delivery,  birth  weight,  race,  maternal 
education,  economic  status,  parity,  and  alcohol  use.  Drews  (1996)  argues  that 
maternal  smoking  may  be  a  preventable  cause  of  mental  retardation.  In 
addition,  children  (particularly  adolescent  girls)  of  smoking  mothers  show 
evidence  of  greater  risk  of  subsequent  drug  use  including  smoking  later  in  life 
(Kandel  etal.,  1994). 

Costs  to  Society 

It  appears  obvious  that  smoking  during  pregnancy  incurs  a  high  societal 
cost.  In  a  recent  meta-analysis  of  the  literature  on  smoking-related  birth  defects, 
Di  Franza  and  Lew  (1995)  reported  that  smoking  during  pregnancy  accounts  for 
an  estimated  19,000  - 141,000  incidents  of  tobacco-induced  miscarriages; 
32,000  -  61 ,000  incidents  of  low  birth  weight;  14,000  -  16,000  smoking- related 
admissions  to  the  neonatal  intensive  care  unit  (NICU);  1,900  -  4,800  postnatal 
deaths  due  to  perinatal  complications;  and  1 ,900  -  4,800  cases  of  Sudden  Infant 
Death  Syndrome  (SIDS).  These  incidents  of  fetal  death  and  increased  health 
care  costs,  longer  hospital  stays  and  greater  life  support  requirements  for  both 
infant  and  mother  have  been  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $60  million  per  year 
(Aronson  et  al.,  1993).  These  figures  may  underrepresent  the  total  contribution 
of  smoking  during  pregnancy  because  actual  biochemical  markers  of  maternal 
smoking  (maternal  and  fetal  cord  blood  levels  of  cotinine,  carboxyhemoglobin, 
and  thiocyanate  (Mercelina-Roumans  et  al.,  1995;  Mercelina-Roumans  et  al..

1996)  indicate  that  pregnant  women  are  smoking  more  than  they  self-report 
(Pley  et  al.,  1991).  Even  when  potential  confounding  variables  (such  as  low 
socioeconomic  status,  poor  nutrition  and  perinatal  care,  and  increased  risk¬ 
taking  behavior)  are  accounted  for,  smoking  during  pregnancy  still  has  a  major 
effect  on  health  and  behavior  of  offspring  (Brooke  et  a!.,  1989;  Fried  et  al.,  1992; 
Levin  et  al.,  1998;  Morrison  et  al.,  1993;  Slotkin,  1998).  Additionally,  a  high 
proportion  of  smokers  tend  to  be  poly-substance  abusers.  These  other 
substances  may  have  effects  by  themselves  and  in  combination  with  nicotine 
(Cutler  et  al.,  1996;  Evenden  et  al.,  1993;  McGivern  et  al.,  1996;  Sobrian  et  al., 
1995).  Therefore,  in  addition  to  epidemiologic  studies  of  the  effects  of  cigarette 
smoking  in  humans,  animal  models  are  important  to  gauge  and  elucidate  effects 
of  maternal  tobacco  smoking  (specifically)  on  offspring  in  the  absence  of 
potentially  confounding  covariables  mentioned  above. 

Animal  Models  of  Cigarette  Smoking 

Nicotine  =  Cigarette  Smoking? 

Despite  the  overwhelming  epidemiologic  evidence  regarding  the  health 
risks  of  exposure  to  cigarette  smoke  in  utero,  it  is  critical  to  conduct  controlled 
experiments  to  determine  causality.  Animal  models  offer  a  valuable  tool  to 
conduct  such  experiments,  but  the  adequacy  of  an  animal  model  for  human 
smoking  behavior  must  be  addressed.  Smoke  derived  from  smoking  tobacco 
cigarettes  is  an  extremely  complex  mixture  of  compounds.  Cigarette  smoke 
aerosol  is  a  lightly  charged,  highly  concentrated  matrix  of  submicron  particles 
contained  in  a  gas  with  each  particle  being  a  multicompositional  collection  of 


8 


compounds  arising  from  distillation,  pyrolysis,  and  combustion  of  tobacco  which 
is  contained  in  a  matrix  of  atmospheric  gases  (nitrogen,  oxygen,  carbon  dioxide, 
carbon  monoxide,  hydrogen,  argon,  and  methane).  Inside  a  burning  cigarette,  a 
large  variety  of  chemical  and  physical  processes  are  occurring  in  an  oxygen- 
deficient,  hydrogen-rich  environment,  with  temperatures  as  high  as  950“ C. 

There  are  two  major  regions  inside  the  burning  zone  of  the  cigarette  where 
products  are  released:  a  heat  producing  combustion  zone,  and  a 
pyrolysis/distillation  zone  just  downstream  of  the  combustion  zone.  The  vast 
majority  of  organic  smoke  products  are  formed  in  the  pyrolysis/distillation  zone 
(Dube  et  al.,  1982).  Approximately  4,000  distinct  compounds  have  been 
identified  in  tobacco  smoke  (see  Tables  1  and  2).  One  or  many  of  these 
compounds  may  have  adverse  effects  on  mother  and  fetus. 

Studies  examining  exposure  of  animals  to  cigarette  smoke  (Bertolini  et  al., 
1982)  and  infusions  of  smokeless  tobacco  have  produced  mixed  results  with 
some  of  these  studies  finding  effects  in  animals  that  are  similar  to  those  found  in 
humans  and  some  finding  few  or  no  effects  (Paulson  et  al.,  1993).  These 
equivocal  findings  may  result  from  differences  in  animal  dosing,  efficacy  of 
administration,  and  clearance  rates  across  species  and  strains.  Nicotine,  the 
principle  addictive  pharmacologic  agent  in  tobacco  also  has  been  identified  as 
the  principle  behavioral  teratogenic  agent  (Riley  et  al.,  1987;  Skalko,  1989; 
Vorhees,  1989)  through  numerous  reports  (e.g.,  Benowitz,  1986;  Levin  et  al., 
1998;  Mactutus,  1989;  Murrin  etal.,  1987;  Navarro  etal.,  1989a;  Slotkin,  1992; 
USDHHS,  1988).  While  other  components  of  cigarette  smoke  may  have 


9 


deleterious  effects  on  the  developing  fetus  (e.g.,  HCN,  carbon  monoxide)  the 
above  reports  clearly  indicate  that  nicotine,  by  itself,  is  sufficient  and  necessary 
to  cause  a  spectrum  of  effects  similar  to  those  found  in  offspring  of  human 
smokers.  These  findings  are  particularly  important  because  of  the  increasing 
use  of  alternative  forms  of  nicotine  administration  as  therapy  for  smoking 
cessation,  especially  if  given  to  a  pregnant  woman  who  wishes  to  quit  smoking. 
Nicotine,  when  administered  to  pregnant  rats,  results  in  a  spectrum  of  effects 
that  mimic  those  effects  found  in  offspring  of  human  smoking  mothers.  These 
effects  include  growth  retardation  (Cutler  et  al.,  1 996;  Paulson  et  al.,  1 994; 
Paulson  et  al.,  1993;  Peters  et  al.,  1982;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987b;  Sobrian  et  al., 
1995),  increased  likelihood  of  hyperactivity  (Richardson  et  al.,  1994;  Tizabi  et  al., 
1997),  memory  deficits  as  indexed  by  performance  in  various  mazes  such  as  the 
Morris  water  maze,  radial-arm  maze,  or  open  field  maze  (Cutler  et  al.,  1996; 
Levin  et  al.,  1996b;  Martin,  1986;  Paulson  et  ai.,  1993;  Peters  et  al.,  1982; 
Sobrian  et  al.,  1995;  Sorenson  et  al.,  1991),  impaired  avoidance  learning 
(Berlolini  et  al.,  1982;  Paulson  et  al.,  1993;  Peters  et  al.,  1982;  Sobrian  et  al., 
1995),  and  impaired  operant  conditioning  (Martin  et  al.,  1971 ;  Martin  et  al., 

1982). 

Routes  of  Administration 

The  next  important  consideration  in  evaluating  animal  models  of  cigarette 
smoking  is  route  of  administration  to  the  animal  subjects.  Several  routes  of 
administration  have  been  employed  in  previous  studies.  These  routes  include: 
inhalation  of  cigarette  smoke;  oral  gavage  of  smokeless  tobacco  extract;  addition 


10 


of  nicotine  to  drinking  water;  injection  of  nicotine,  either  via  singie  or  muitiple 
daily  injections:  or  continuous  infusion,  usually  by  osmotic  minipump  or  by 
implanted  cannulae.  Each  of  these  routes  of  administration  carries  with  it 
important  methodoiogic  considerations  (Murrin  et  al.,  1987).  Normally  in 
humans  smoked  tobacco  is  self  administered  many  times  per  day.  This  form  of 
administration  results  in  transient  peak  boli  of  nicotine  throughout  the  course  of 
the  day  overlaying  a  steadily  increasing  level  of  nicotine  in  the  blood  (Benowitz, 
1986;  Benowitz  et  al.,  1993;  Benowitz  et  al.,  1994).  In  addition  to  nicotine, 
tobacco  smoke  contains  many  other  potentially  pharmacotogically-active 
compounds,  such  as  carbon  monoxide  and  cyanide  {Mactutus,  1989).  These 
compounds,  in  particular,  as  w  4I  as  nicotine  cause  transient  hypoxia  and 
ischemia  through  interference  with  oxygen  delivery  (increased  levels  of 
carboxyhemoglobin)  and  uterine  and  placental  vasoconstriction  (Martin  et  al., 
1971).  Injected  nicotine  replicates  this  bolus  type  of  administration.  However, 
many  investigators  inject  very  large  doses  of  nicotine  only  once  or  twice  per  day. 
This  large  bolus  of  nicotine  results  in  peak  plasma  concentrations  that  far  exceed 
any  found  in  human  smokers  (Benowitz  et  al.,  1994;  Levin  et  al.,  1993b; 
Mercelina-Roumans  et  al.,  1996)  even  when  different  rates  of  metabolism  and 
clearance  in  animals  are  taken  into  account.  Additionally,  such  high 
concentrations  of  nicotine  result  in  increased  placental  vasculature  constriction 
resulting  in  hypoxic  injury  not  seen  with  lower  or  sustained  nicotine 
concentrations  (Benowitz,  1986;  Dow  et  al.,  1975;  Levin  et  al.,  1993b;  Muneoka 
et  al.,  1997;  Navarro  et  al.,  1988;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987a; 


11 


Slotkin  et  al.,  1987b;  Werler  et  al.,  1985),  In  pilot  studies  undertaken  by  the 
author  some  rats  injected  daily  with  nicotine  (single  daily  subcutaneous  injection 
of  1 .0  mg/kg  nicotine  in  a  volume  of  1 .0  ml/kg)  went  into  transient  respiratory 
crisis.  Some  of  these  animals  required  supportive  intervention  while  others 
spontaneously  recovered  after  several  minutes.  Studies  examining  effects  of 
experimentally-induced  hypoxia  and  effects  of  injected  nicotine  have  found 
behavioral  and  biochemical  similarities  (Martin  et  al.,  1971;  Slotkin,  1992). 
Finally,  the  stress  of  repeated  handling  and  injecting  pregnant  rats  has  been 
shown  to  have  additional  effects  with  behavioral  and  biochemical  sequelae 
(Bertolini  et  al.,  1982;  Peters,  1986a:  Peters,  1986b). 

Addition  of  nicotine  to  drinking  water  avoids  these  bolus  injection 
problems  and  is  simple  and  noninvasive.  However,  when  this  method  is  used, 
rats  become  hypodipsic  and  hypophagic  (Murrin  et  al.,  1987).  This  reduction  in 
feeding  and  drinking  behavior  and  resultant  poor  nutrition  has  obvious 
deleterious  effects  on  mother  and  offspring  and  may  confound  interpretation  of 
subsequent  behavioral  or  cognitive  outcomes.  Additionally,  oral  nicotine 
bioavailability  is  poor.  Approximately  45%  of  nicotine  is  absorbed  in  this  manner 
and  much  of  that  is  metabolized  through  first-pass  metabolism  by  the  liver 
(Benowitz  et  al.,  1993). 

Constant,  low  level  infusion  of  nicotine  throughout  gestation  circumvents 
the  shortcomings  mentioned  above.  Grunberg  and  colleagues  have  pioneered 
the  use  of  osmotic  minipumps  as  a  technique  to  chronically  administer  nicotine 
to  rats  and  have  continued  to  successfully  use  this  technique  to  reveal  new 


12 


behavioral  and  biological  findings  of  effects  of  nicotine  that  have  been  predictive 
of  effects  later  confirmed  in  human  studies  (e.g.,  Acri  et  al.,  1995;  Acri  et  al., 
1994;  Faraday  et  al.,  1998a;  Grunberg,  1982;  Grunberg,  1985;  Grunberg,  1992; 
Grunberg  et  al.,  1984;  Grunberg  et  al.,  1987;  Winders  et  al.,  1990).  Specifically, 
for  nearly  20  years  Grunberg  and  colleagues  have  used  Alzet  (Alza  Corp.,  Palo 
Alto,  CA)  osmotic  minipumps  to  administer  nicotine  or  saline  for  various 
durations  to  rats.  This  method  of  drug  administration  avoids  the  repeated  stress 
of  daily  injections  and  provides  a  slow,  continuous  infusion. 

This  method  does  not,  however,  precisely  mimic  the  topography  of 
nicotine  administration  via  cigarette  smoking  in  which  multiple  boli  of  nicotine  are 
overlaid  on  top  of  steadily  increasing  “background”  levels  —  low  during  the  night 
and  increasing  during  the  course  of  the  day  {Benowitz  et  al.,  1 994).  Overall, 
however,  this  method  provides  an  ideal  balance  of  factors  and  is  considered  an 
excellent  animal  model  of  human  nicotine  intake  (Levin  et  al.,  1993b;  Murrin  et 
al.,  1987;  Navarro  et  al.,  1988;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987a:  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987b).  In 
addition,  nicotine’s  chronic  as  opposed  to  acute  effects  may  be  particularly 
relevant  to  understand  behaviors  of  heavy  smokers  who  are  likely  to  maintain 
nicotinic  cholinergic  receptors  in  a  chronically  desensitized  state  as  a  result  of 
frequent  and  intensive  nicotine  self-administration  (Benwell  et  al.,  1 995).  In 
addition,  this  particular  method  of  drug  administration  is  similar  to  some  of  the 
new  nicotine  replacement  therapies  (e.g.,  the  nicotine  patch).  This  consideration 
may  be  particularly  relevant  because  women  who  wish  to  quit  smoking  during 
pregnancy  may  be  counseled  by  their  physicians  to  begin  nicotine  replacement 


13 


therapy  during  pregnancy  (Levin  et  al.,  1998;  Slotkin,  1998). 

A  range  of  dosages  has  been  evaluated  by  Grunberg  and  colleagues 
(including  2.5,  5.0,  6.0,  9.0,  and  12.0  mg/kg/day)  and  they  have  found  that  these 
dosages  result  in  reliable  behavioral  effects  that  parallel  effects  in  humans  that 
smoke  (e.g.,  Grunberg,  1982;  Grunberg,  1992;  Winders  et  al.,  1990;  Winders  et 
al.,  1998).  Of  these  dosages,  6.0  and  12.0  mg/kg/day  establish  clear  dose- 
response  effects  in  adult  rats  on  body  weight  and  feeding,  locomotion,  acoustic 
startle  response,  and  pre-pulse  inhibition  of  the  acoustic  startle  response  (see 

t, 

I  '  » 

sections  below).  In  addition,  blood  samples  have  been  assayed  for  nicotine  and 
cotinine  to  establish  the  meaningfulness  of  these  dosages  (Winders  et  al.,  1998). 
Pharmacokinetic  studies  suggest  that  1-2  pack  per  day  smokers  (20-40 
cigarettes  a  day)  have  venous  plasma  cotinine  levels  of  about  50  ng/ml  and 
arterial  plasma  levels  of  approximately  100-150  ng/ml  (Benowitz,  1986;  Benowitz 
et  al.,  1993;  Benowitz  et  al.,  1994).  Investigations  with  rats  have  used  trunk 
blood  which  contains  mostly  arterial  blood.  Published  reports  with  male  rats 
suggest  that  the  6  mg/kg/day  minipump  preparation  yields  plasma  nicotine  levels 
of  approximately  100-150  ng/ml,  similar  to  the  average  human  smoker 
(Richardson  et  al.,  1994;  Winders  et  al.,  1998).  Additionally,  exposure  to  the  12 
mg/kg/day  minipump  preparation  results  in  plasma  nicotine  levels  that  range 
from  300-450  ng/ml  in  male  rats  (Winders  et  al.,  1998).  This  plasma  level  is 
higher  than  that  found  in  the  average  smoker.  However,  a  ratio  of  between  4:1 
(for  brain  nicotine  levels)  and  8:1  (for  peripheral  nicotine  levels)  should  be  taken 
into  consideration  when  comparing  drug  plasma  levels  in  rat  with  those  found  in 


14 


humans  because  rats  metabolize  nicotine  at  a  much  higher  rate  than  humans 
(Plowchalk  et  al.,  1992).  Finaily,  Merceiina-Roumans  and  colleagues  (1995; 
1996)  have  measured  venous  plasma  cotinine  levels  in  mothers  who  smoke  and 
in  their  neonates’  cord  blood.  They  reported  that  cotinine  easily  crosses  the 
placental  barrier  in  a  positive  linear  relationship  to  maternal  smoking  behavior 
and  that  there  seemed  to  be  a  limit  of  at  ieast  ten  cigarettes  smoked  per  day  to 
reach  detectable  levels  in  neonate  cord  blood.  Additionally,  Peacock  and 
colleagues  (1991),  have  suggested  a  threshold  of  13  cigarettes  a  day  to  be  a 
minimum  threshold  to  detect  effects  of  cigarettes  smoking  on  birth  weight. 
Therefore,  the  dosages  used  in  this  experiment  fail  within  these  ranges  and  are 
considered  were  appropriate  and  sufficient. 

Effects  on  Fetus 

But  how  does  nicotine  administration  affect  development  of  the  fetus?  As 
mentioned  above,  nicotine  administration  during  pregnancy  results  in  lower  birth 
weight  and  retarded  growth  in  offspring.  However,  when  nicotine  is  administered 
during  pregnancy  at  dosages  too  low  to  bring  on  these  gross  morphologic 
effects,  cognitive  and  behavioral  deficits  can  still  be  measured  (Fung,  1989; 
Navarro  et  al.,  1989b;  Slotkin,  1992).  This  fact  indicates  that  the  brain  is 
particularly  sensitive  to  the  effects  of  nicotine  during  development.  One  method 
used  to  track  alterations  in  brain  development  is  ornithine  decarboxylase  (ODC), 
a  key  enzymatic  marker  for  repair  of  cell  damage  (Gillette  et  al.,  1991 ;  Slotkin, 
1998;  Vendrell  et  al.,  1991).  Chronic  infusion  of  6  mg/kg/day  of  nicotine  to  rats 
causes  pronounced  and  widespread  increases  in  ODC  activity  levels  during 


15 


gestation  and  throughout  early  postnatal  life  and  is  associated  with  actual  loss  of 
brain  cells  as  indicated  by  lower  levels  of  DNA  in  each  brain  region  {Navarro  et 
al.,  1989b;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1997;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1987b).  This  deficit  in  DNA  levels 
caused  by  prenatal  nicotine  exposure  persists  throughout  the  brain  "growth 
spurt"  period  (Slotkin  et  al.,  1987b)  and  recovery  of  cell  numbers  occurs  only 
after  neurogenesis  has  been  completed,  indicting  that  neurons  have  been 
replaced  by  glia  (Slotkin,  1998).  Additionally,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that 
nicotine  administration  can  increase  levels  of  the  protooncogene  c-fos  (Nomikos 
et  al.,  1995;  Slotkin  et  al.,  1997).  This  gene  triggers  apoptosis,  or  programmed 
cell  death,  in  otherwise  healthy  cells  (Slotkin,  1998)  further  reducing  numbers  of 
brain  cells  and  delaying  neuronal  maturation  (Roy  et  al.,  1994). 

A  second  possible  method  by  which  nicotine  alters  neural  development  is 
to  change  "cellular  tuning”  of  individual  and  populations  of  neurons.  During  the 
rat’s  22-day  gestation  period,  the  last  two  weeks  are  a  time  of  neuron  mitosis 
and  migration.  This  is  a  time  of  "cellular  tuning”  during  which  basal 
neurotransmitter  levels  are  adjusted  and  responses  to  those  levels  of  transmitter 
are  set  (Slotkin,  1992).  During  this  time  neural  cells  are  dividing  and  making 
connections  with  other  cells  in  the  brain.  Once  connections  are  made  and  nerve 
impulses  are  transmitted,  mitosis  stops  and  differentiation  takes  place  (Seidler  et 
al.,  1994;  Slotkin,  1998).  Slotkin  (1997)  reported  that  prenatal  nicotine  elicits 
delayed  neurotoxicity  by  altering  both  the  timing  of  cellular  differentiation  and 
programming  of  cell  death.  Specifically,  exposure  to  nicotine  during  this  period 
causes  cells  to  prematurely  cease  active  division  and  undergo  differentiation.

Memory 

History 

The  study  of  memory  has  its  roots  as  far  back  as  ancient  Greece  when 
the  philosopher  Plato  made  his  bird-brain  analogy  {Eysenck  et  al.,  1995).  In  this 
analogy,  memory  was  likened  to  a  birdhouse,  the  memories  themselves  being 
the  birds.  During  the  process  of  recall,  one  need  only  enter  the  birdhouse  and 
catch  the  correct  bird.  Errors  in  recall  were  attributed  to  catching  the  wrong  bird. 
In  this  model,  memory  is  a  monolithic  system,  having  no  separate  parts  devoted 
to  encoding,  storage,  or  retrieval  of  the  information  to  be  remembered.  Likewise, 
there  were  no  attempts  made  to  isolate  different  types  of  memory;  memory  was 
memory.  This  model  for  memory  lasted  for  centuries. 

The  first  attempt  to  suggest  that  memory  might  not  be  such  a  monolithic 
system  came  when  William  James  used  the  term  “primary  memory"  (James, 
1890)  to  refer  to  those  short-lasting  ideas  or  thoughts  that  are  present  in  the 
mind  in  the  absence  of  the  events  that  triggered  them.  However,  the  intensive 
study  of  short  and  long  term  memory  did  not  occur  until  Hebb  (1949)  raised  the 
possibility  of  two  different  memory  systems:  long-  and  short-term  memory.  A 
few  years  later,  Broadbent  (1958)  produced  his  seminal  information  processing 
model  of  short-term  memory.  In  this  model,  short-term  memory  consisted  of  two 
subsystems:  the  S  system,  capable  of  storing  sensory  information  from  many 
sources  for  a  very  short  period  of  time,  and  the  P  system  which  had  a  limited 
capacity  for  processing  information.  This  model  was  further  modified  by 
Atkinson  and  Shiffrin's  multi-store  model  (Atkinson  et  al.,  1968).  In  this  model, 


17 


there  are  three  memory  stores:  a  sensory  store,  a  short-term  store,  and  a 
long-term  store.  Theses  stores  are  differentiated  by  longevity  of  the  memory 
trace,  and  amount  of  information  that  can  be  stored.  The  sensory  store  can  hold 
a  variable  amount  of  information,  but  can  hold  that  information  for  only  an 
extremely  short  period  of  time,  on  the  order  of  milliseconds  (ms).  The  short-term 
memory  store  can  hold  a  small  number  of  items  (ideally  7  ±  2)  for  a  short  amount 
of  time,  approximately  several  tens  of  seconds  (Miller,  1956).  Additionally, 
short-term  memory  is  susceptible  to  interference  and  decay  (Baddeley,  1986). 

In  other  words,  the  information  that  is  being  encoded  can  be  mis-encoded  by  the 
short-term  memory  store  by  presentation  of  conflicting  or  interfering  stimuli,  and 
for  that  information  to  be  used,  it  must  be  rehearsed,  or  refreshed  constantly  or 
the  memory  trace  decays  and  the  memory  is  lost.  The  long-term  memory  store 
can  hold  a  seemingly  infinite  amount  of  information  for  an  extremely  long  time 
(i.e.,  years).  The  multi-store  model,  based  closely  on  the  computer  model  of 
information  processing,  became  a  most  popular  and  influential  model  to  explain 
memory  processes  in  the  1970‘s,  yet,  it  too  has  its  problems.  For  example, 
nowhere  in  this  model  is  the  location  of  any  of  these  stores  explained.  There 
could  be  only  one  short-term  memory  store  that  processes  and  holds  all 
short-term  memories  or  there  could  be  several  that  are  responsible  for  storing 
memory  information  of  a  specific  type  or  based  on  a  specific  sensory  modality. 
Additionaily,  as  stated  in  the  model,  information  is  transferred  into  long-term 
stores  through  short-term  memory,  yet  the  model  does  not  explain  the  existence 
of  amnesia  patients  who  have  little  or  no  short-term  memory  ability,  yet  can  still 


18 


process  certain  information  into  long-term  stores  (Baddeley,  1 995). 

To  address  some  of  the  shortcomings  of  the  multi-store  memory  model, 
Baddeley  and  Hitch  {Baddeley,  1995;  Baddeley,  1986;  Baddeley  et  al.,  1974) 
suggested  the  working  memory  model.  In  this  model,  the  unitary  short-term 
memory  store  was  replaced  by  a  three-part,  inter-functional  working  memory 
store.  This  working  memory  store  is  postulated  to  consist  of  a  central  executive 
that  acts  as  an  attention  a  I  controller  to  direct  cognitive  and  attentional  resources 
to  two  slave  systems:  an  articulatory  or  phonological  loop  and  a  visuospatia! 
scratchpad  or  sketchpad.  The  articulatory  or  phonological  loop  is  primarily 
responsible  for  encoding  verbal  or  spoken  information,  particularly  in  the 
acquisition  of  language.  The  visuospatial  sketchpad  is  primarily  responsible  for 
encoding  and  refreshing  of  visual  and  spatial  information  (Baddeley,  1 995; 
Eysenck  et  al.,  1995).  Separating  the  functions  of  these  two  working  memory 
subsystems  explains  how  patients  with  specific  neurological  problems  can  still 
learn  new  tasks  and  encode  new  information.  For  example,  patients  with  a 
defective  phonological  loop  are  thought  to  still  have  a  functional  central 
executive  and  visuospatial  scratchpad  and  are  not  expected  to  show  complete 
inability  to  learn  and  store  information  into  the  long-term  store  (Baddeley,  1 995; 
Schacteret  al.,  1995). 

By  the  1 970s,  the  theory  that  memory  consists  of  multiple  stores  was  well- 
established.  It  was  even  accepted  that  each  of  those  stores  consisted  of 
multiple  substores,  or  subunits  (Norman,  1970;  Schacter  et  al.,  1995).  The  task 
then  was  to  identify  the  underlying  neurobiological  substrates  for  each  of  these 


19 


stores.  This  section  discusses  the  neurobiological  processes  underlying  the 
visuospatial  sketchpad  of  the  working  memory  model  because  this  portion  of 
working  memory  lends  itself  well  to  investigation  in  an  animal  model.  Both  of 
the  mazes  used  in  this  experiment  —  water  maze  and  radial-arm  maze  —  test 
visually-cued  memory  performance  (Decker,  1995;  Hodges,  1996;  Morris,  1981; 
Olton  et  al.,  1977).  The  visuospatial  sketchpad,  like  working  memory  itself,  is 
divided  into  two  different  subsystems  located  in  two  different  brain  regions:  a 
system  for  object  (or  feature)  processing  and  a  system  for  spatial  processing 
(Sawaguchi  et  al.,  1994;  Wilson  et  al.,  1993).  It  is  hypothesized  that  mazes  task 
the  spatial  processing  system.  Radial-arm  maze  is  a  food- motivated  task  and 
water  maze  utilizes  an  “escape  from  an  aversive  situation"  paradigm  (see 
Methods  below).  Both  types  of  maze  were  used  to  increase  the  likelihood  that 
findings  reflect  spatial  memory  perse  rather  than  reflecting  either  appetitive 
changes  or  stress  responses  as  a  result  of  prenatal  nicotine  exposure.  The 
passive  avoidance  shuttlebox  test  was  included  to  evaluate  more  general 
cognitive  performance  (Decker,  1 995).  Therefore,  this  experiment  examined  the 
effects  of  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  on  two  types  of  spatial  working  memory 
tasks  as  well  as  a  task  of  general  cognitive  performance. 

Relevant  Neuroscience 

Studying  memory  in  an  animal  model  immediately  presents  a  certain 
number  of  difficulties  at  the  outset.  For  example,  one  cannot  ask  a  monkey  to 
learn  a  list  of  words  or  digits  (digit-span),  one  of  the  most  widely  used  forms  of 
human  memory  functioning  (Eysenck  et  al.,  1995).  Another  argument  against 


20 


the  utility  of  using  animals  to  study  cognition  is  that,  according  to  Skinner  (1984), 
cognition  and  all  other  such  "private"  events  cannot  be  directly  observed  and, 
therefore,  provide  no  "explanatory  value."  However,  Terrace  (1984)  points  out 
that  both  in  human  and  animal  cognition  it  is  assumed  that  the  normal  state  of 
affairs  is  unconscious  activity  and  thought  and  therefore  that  memory  can  be 
studied  in  animals.  Indeed,  additional  processes  must  be  postulated  in  order  to 
account  for  an  individual's  consciousness  of  activities,  perceptions,  thoughts, 
and  so  on. 

With  regard  to  working  memory,  paradigms  exist  that  can  be  used  with 
animal  subjects.  The  classic  delayed-response  task  in  animals  is  as  follows. 

The  experimental  subject  is  shown  a  food  (reinforcing)  item.  The  food  item  is 
then  hidden  from  view  by  an  opaque  screen  for  a  variable  delay  of  several 
seconds.  The  subject  is  then  allowed  to  choose  the  location  of  the  food  out  of 
two  or  more  locations.  While  the  food  is  out  of  sight,  the  subject  must  hold  the 
location  of  the  food  item  in  mind  for  several  seconds  in  order  to  correctly  choose 
its  location.  In  order  to  choose  the  correct  location  of  the  food,  the  experimental 
subject  animal  must  choose  a  location  based  on  the  memory  of  the  food,  and  not 
based  on  the  stimulus  of  the  food  itself.  Because  the  location  of  the  food  item  is 
randomly  moved  between  locations  with  each  trial,  prior  experience  with  the  test 
cannot  predict  the  location  of  the  food.  Therefore,  the  animal  must  use  memory 
of  the  location  of  the  food  for  its  choice. 

Goldman-Rakic  and  colleagues  have  studied  working  memory  extensively 
using  a  variant  of  this  task.  In  the  Goldman-Rakic  model,  working  memory  is 


21 


defined  in  its  most  elementary  form,  as  the  ability  to  keep  events  in  mind  for 
short  periods  of  time,  and  has  been  studied  in  non-human  primates  by 
delayed-response  paradigms  (Goldman-Rakic,  1 995).  In  this  paradigm,  an 
oculomotor  version  of  this  classic  paradigm  is  used.  In  the  oculomotor  version, 
the  animal  is  trained  to  fixate  on  a  point  on  a  computer  screen.  The  animal 
remains  fixated  on  that  spot  during  a  brief  (0.5  s)  presentation  of  a  stimulus  (a 
spot  of  color  at  a  specific  orientation:  e.g.  45“  from  the  fixation  point)  and  for  a 
3-5  second  delay  period,  after  which  the  animal  must  look  in  the  target  direction 
to  receive  a  reward.  This  paradigm  allows  control  over  latency  to  react,  exact, 
single-cell  recording  of  events  in  the  frontal  cortex,  and  precise  control  over 
location  of  presentation  of  stimulus  in  the  visual  field. 

Using  the  oculomotor  delayed-response  paradigm  and  single-cell 
recording  of  neurons  in  the  prefrontal  cortex,  Goldman-Rakic  and  colleagues 
(Funahashi  et  al.,  1989;  Goldman-Rakic,  1990;  Goldman-Rakic,  1993;  Goldman- 
Rakic,  1995;  Goldman-Rakic  et  al.,  1991;  Goldman-Rakic  et  al.,  1990; 

Sawaguchi  et  al.,  1994)  have  identified  memory  fields,  defined  as  maximal  firing 
of  a  neuron  to  the  representation  of  a  target,  in  one  ora  few  locations  of  the 
visual  field,  with  the  same  neuron  always  coding  the  same  location.  Not  only  do 
these  cellular  circuits  hold  memories  for  specific  locations,  but  they  are  mutually 
inhibitory  to  locations  oriented  at  90“ .  That  is,  for  a  cell-circuit  that  fires 
maximally  during  the  delay  period  for  a  stimulus  at  225“,  that  same  network  of 
cells  decreases  firing  rates  below  baseline  during  the  delay  for  a  stimulus  at 
135“  or  31 5“ .  Just  as  in  the  visual  system,  this  allows  the  memory  system  to  be 


22 


precisely  tuned  and  focused  for  each  particular  stimulus.  Finally,  repeated 
recordings  from  the  same  network  of  cells  show  that  the  increase  in  firing  rate  is 
consistently  correlated  with  the  onset  and  offset  of  the  memory  task,  That  is, 
firing  increases  as  soon  as  the  stimulus  is  removed,  and  decreases  once  the 
response  has  been  made. 

The  neurotransmitter  circuitry  (Goldman-Rakic,  1990;  Goldman-Rakic, 
1993;  Goldman-Rakic,  1995)  as  well  as  cortico-cortical  connections  (Goldman- 
Rakic  et  al.,  1991)  have  been  partially  identified  by  Goldman-Rakic  and 
colleagues  in  primates.  Particularly  of  interest  in  spatial  working  memory  is  the 
connection  of  the  hippocampus  with  the  prefrontal  cortex.  Early  work  of  Olton 
and  others  have  identified  the  key  role  that  the  hippocampus  plays  in  spatial 
memory  processing  (Olton,  1983;  Olton  et  ai.,  1979a).  Goldman-Rakic  and 
colleagues  have  identified  largely  bidirectional  projections  between  the 
hippocampus  and  areas  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  in  primates  (Goldman-Rakic  et 
al.,  1984).  Additionally,  functional  studies  have  identified  similarities  between 
behavioral  effects  of  hippocampal  damage  (Zola-Morgan  et  al.,  1985)  and 
prefrontal  cortex  damage  (Brozoski  et  al.,  1979;  Goldman  et  at.,  1970).  Similar 
results  have  been  reported  during  delay-requirement  tasks  when  the  prefrontal 
cortex  (Funahashi  et  al.,  1989)  or  hippocampus  (Watanabe  et  al.,  1985)  has 
been  damaged.  Similar  neuroanatomic  structures  exist  in  the  rat  (Kolb,  1 990) 
and  the  rat  is  an  adequate  model  for  examining  prefrontal  cortex  (Kolb,  1990b), 
specifically  cognitive  and  memory  performance  tasks  (Kolb,  1990a;  Kolb  et  al., 
1994).  Major  input  to  the  prefrontal  cortex  arises  from  the  medial  dorsal  nucleus 


23 

of  the  thalamus  and  additional  inputs  arise  from  the  ventral  mesencephalic 
tegmentum  (VMT),  the  nucleus  accumbens,  substantia  nigra,  and  the  CA1 
region  of  the  hippocampus  (Kolb,  1990a), 

Among  other  transmitter  systems  {e.g.,  cholinergic,  noradrenergic),  it 
appears  that  the  dopaminergic  system  plays  a  key  role  in  the  ability  of  the  animal 
to  perform  spatial  working  memory  tasks.  Many  of  these  dopaminergic 
prefrontal  cortex  neurons  arise  from  the  striatum,  VMT,  and  substantia  nigra 
(Kolb,  1990a;  Thierry  et  al.,  1988).  Numerous  investigators  have  shown  that 
direct  stimulation  of  these  areas  will  release  dopamine  in  the  prefrontal  cortex 
(Garris  et  al.,  1993;  Glowinski  et  al.,  1988;  Thierry  et  al.,  1988).  This  model  has 
been  borne  out  empirically.  Experiments  that  have  examined  performance  in 
primates  and  rodents  using  various  types  of  mazes  and  visuo-spatial  tasks  have 
found  that  when  dopamine  levels  are  increased  in  the  frontal  cortex  memory 
performance  Is  improved  (Levin,  1988;  Packard  et  al.,  1994;  Puglisiallegra  et  al., 
1994a;  Puglisiallegra  et  al..  1994b;  White,  1988;  White  et  al.,  1993).  Conversely, 
when  dopamine  neurons  are  released  from  tonic  endogenous  opioid  peptide 
inhibition  (Izquierdo  et  al.,  1980)  or  from  morphine-based  inhibition  (Castellano 
et  al.,  1994)  memory  performance  also  improves.  However,  when  dopamine 
levels  are  too  high,  memory  performance  can  be  compromised  (Murphy  et  al., 
1996;  Verma  et  al.,  1996).  When  dopamine  levels  are  reduced  (Brozoski  et  al., 
1979),  either  by  means  of  prenatal  exposure  to  a  toxin  (Lakshmana  et  al.,  1994), 
or  by  selective  dopamine  neuron  ablation  using  6-hydroxydopamine  (Grigoryan 
et  al.,  1996;  White,  1988),  memory  performance  is  compromised  but  can  be 


24 


restored  by  addition  of  dopamine  or  dopamine-releasing  agents  such  as 
amphetamine  (White,  1988)  or  nicotine  {Grigoryan  et  al.,  1996).  Likewise,  when 
examining  the  role  that  specific  dopamine  receptor  subtypes  play  in  memory 
performance,  it  is  clear  that  stimulation  of  D1  receptors  enhances  memory 
performance  (Hersi  et  al.,  1995;  Sawaguchi  et  al.,  1988;  Williams  et  al.,  1995), 
while  antagonism  of  these  receptors  inhibits  it  (Broersen  et  al.,  1 994;  Broersen  et 
al.,  1995;  Didriksen,  1995;  Doyle  et  al.,  1993;  Sawaguchi  et  al.,  1991;  Sawaguchi 
et  al.,  1994).  The  picture,  however  is  not  as  clear  for  D2  receptors  (Arnsten  et 
al.,  1995;  Puglisiallegra  et  al.,  1994a;  Puglisiallegra  et  al.,  1994b).  Stimulation  of 
D2  receptors  seems  to  impair  memory  performance  (Arnsten  et  al.,  1995; 
Bushnell  et  al,,  1993;  Uchihashi  et  al.,  1994;  Verma  et  al,,  1993),  whereas 
antagonism  seems  to  enhance  it  or  have  no  effect  (Galkina  et  al.,  1996; 
Sawaguchi  et  al.,  1 994;  Zarrindast  et  al.,  1 992).  It  is  thought  that  low  doses  of 
D2  agonists  stimulate  inhibitory  auto  receptors,  whereas  higher  doses  stimulate 
post  synaptic  D2  receptors  that  have  an  excitatory  effect  (Zarrindast  et  al., 

1992),  but  this  improvement  is  accompanied  by  "hallucinatory-like"  behaviors 
and  dyskinesias  (Arnsten  et  al.,  1995).  Based  on  the  preceding  discussion,  it  is 
clear  the  dopamine  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  plays  a  key  role  in  spatial  working 
memory  performance,  particularly  D1  receptors,  and  that  alterations  in  this 
system  may  underlie  changes  in  memory  performance.  This  experiment 
examined  changes  in  D1  receptor  number  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex 
because  of  its  potential  role  in  memory  performance. 

Nicotine  has  been  reported  to  play  an  important  role  in  memory 


25 


performance  in  subjects  that  either  were  compromised  or  displayed  memory 
performance  baselines  that  were  impaired,  as  compared  with  adult  controls. 
Specifically,  animals  that  showed  improved  memory  in  response  to  nicotine 
either  were:  very  young  (Smith  et  al.,  1996);  very  old  (Arendash  et  al.,  1995a; 
Arendash  et  al.,  1995b;  Levin  et  al.,  1996a;  Meguro  et  al.,  1994;  Widzowski  et 
al.,  1994);  treated  with  nicotinic  or  dopaminergic  system  antagonists  (Levin  et  al., 
1996;  Nitta  et  al.,  1994;  Widzowski  et  al.,  1994);  or  neurosurgically  altered 
(Grigoryan  et  al.,  1996;  Levin,  1993a;  Levin  et  al.,  1993c).  Nicotine's  actions  to 
improve  memory  appeared  to  consist  of  restoring  performance  to  baseline  levels 
after  damage  or  compromise.  This  finding  is  mirrored  in  the  human  attentional 
literature  in  that  the  clearest  cognition-enhancing  nicotine  effects  are  evident  as 
amelioration  of  attentional  deficits  in  compromised  individuals  such  as 
Alzheimer's  patients  (Levin  et  al.,  1994;  Newhouse  et  al.,  1988;  Sahakian  et  al., 
1991)  and  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  patients  (Levin  et  al., 
1993;  Levin  et  al.,  1994). 

Nicotine  appears  to  act  on  memory  by  means  of  cholinergic  innervation  of 
areas  that  synapse  in  the  frontal  cortex,  such  as  the  VMT,  nucleus  accumbens 
and  striatum  (Kolb,  1990a),  as  well  as  via  nicotine's  actions  to  release  dopamine 
postsynaptically  (Balfour,  1994;  Balfour  et  al.,  1993;  Levin,  1992;  Levin  et  al., 
1994;  Levin  et  al.,  1995;  Summers  et  al.,  1994;  Summers  et  al.,  1995). 

Therefore,  it  was  hypothesized  that  nicotine  administration  during  gestation 
would  alter  memory  performance  in  the  offspring  due  to  alterations  in  the 
nicotinic  cholinergic  receptor  system  and  its  down-stream  effects  on  the 


26 


dopaminergic  system  such  as  changes  in  receptor  number  (Fung  et  al.,  1989; 
Gelbard  et  al.,  1990;  Muneoka  et  al.,  1997;  Navarro  et  al.,  1988).  Alterations  in 
these  systems  may  be  revealed  by  alterations  in  memory  performance  in  the 
offspring.  It  also  was  hypothesized  that,  as  a  result  of  prenatal  nicotine 
exposure,  changes  in  memory  performance  would  be  accompanied  by  changes 
in  D1  receptor  density  in  the  area  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  associated  with  spatial 
working  memory  performance:  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  (Broersen  et  al., 

1994;  Broersen  et  al.,  1995;  Murphy  et  al.,  1996). 

“Nicotinic  cholinergic  receptors  are  Involved  intimately  in  the  regulation  of 
catecholaminergic  function  in  the  CNS,  so  it  is  not  surprising  that...  dopaminergic 
synaptic  transmissions  also  are  affected  adversely  by  fetal  nicotine  exposure” 
(Slotkin,  1998,  p  935).  Dopamine,  in  particular,  is  of  interest  because  of  its  role 
in  memory  performance.  Prenatal  nicotine  decreased  the  total  number  of 
dopaminergic  (DA)  receptors  in  brains  of  male  offspring  as  indexed  by 
alterations  in  dopamine  metabolites  that  persist  throughout  gestation  and  into 
adulthood  (Ribary  et  al.,  1989).  Maternal  infusion  of  nicotine  (6  mg/kg/day)  via 
osmotic  minipump  reduced  tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity  and  altered 
catecholamine  (specifically  dopamine)  content  and  utilization  in  cerebral  cortex 
of  offspring  (Muneoka  et  al.,  1997;  Navarro  et  al.,  1988)  indicating  cortical 
dopaminergic  system  inactivity  as  a  result  of  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine.  This 
effect  was  found  immediately  after  birth  but  tended  to  disappear  over  the  next 
few  weeks,  but  reappeared  by  early  adulthood  (Navarro  et  al.,  1988)  indicating 
that  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  causes  alterations  in  dopamine 


27 


neurotransmission,  but  also  that  this  effect  changes  over  the  life  of  the  offspring. 
Additionally,  infusion  of  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine  during  pregnancy  reduced  number 
of  D2  receptors  in  ventral  tegmental  area  (VTA)  as  welt  as  striatum,  but  not 
nucleus  accumbens  or  frontal  cortex  and  increased  numbers  in  substantia  nigra 
(Richardson  et  al.,  1994).  However,  maternal  infusion  of  a  very  low  dose  of 
nicotine  (1.5  mg/kg/day)  for  5  days  increased  the  number  of  nicotinic  receptor 
binding  sites  and  elevated  dopamine  levels  in  the  striatum  of  male  offspring 
(Fung  et  al.,  1989).  A  two-week  infusion  of  this  very  tow  dose  was  associated 
with  an  increase  in  striatal  nicotinic  and  spiperone  (D2/5HT2  antagonist)  binding 
sites  and  was  associated  with  a  potentiation  of  locomotor  hyperactivity  induced 
by  nicotine  injection  (Fung  et  al.,  1988).  The  two-week  infusion  was  also 
associated  with  an  enhanced  ability  of  striatal  tissue  slices  from  the 
nicotine-exposed  pups  to  synthesize  [^Hjdopamine  from  [^Hjtyrosine  and  with  an 
increased  the  rate  of  striatal  dopamine  turnover  in  male  offspring  (Fung,  1989). 
This  effect  was  not  found  in  nucleus  accumbens  (Fung  et  al.,  1991;  Fung  et  al., 
1992).  These  conflicting  results  may  be  a  result  of  the  very  low  dose  that  was 
utilized  by  these  investigators.  This  experiment  used  higher  dosages  and  it  was 
hypothesized  that  the  findings  would  be  consistent  with  those  of  researchers 
mentioned  above  who  used  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine.  Further,  it  was  hypothesized 
that  because  nicotine  alters  dopaminergic  neurotransmission  in  areas  that 
synapse  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex,  and  that  because  dopamine  in  this  area 
is  involved  in  memory  performance,  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  would  alter 
memory  performance.

As  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  working  memory  can  be  studied  in 
an  animal  model.  Further,  the  dependent  variables  used  in  the  present 
experiment  also  tested  a  form  of  spatial  working  memory  (e.g.,  the  water  maze 
and  radial-arm  maze)  as  well  as  an  index  of  non-spatial  memory  (passive 
avoidance)  and  are  widely  used  to  test  memory  performance  in  the  rodent 
model. 

Dopamine 

Physical  Chemistry 

Dopamine  (CgHnNOg)  is  a  catecholamine;  i.e.,  a  catechol  base  (a 
benzene  ring  with  two  -OH  groups  attached  at  carbons  3  and  4),  with  an 
ethylamine  (-CH2— CHj-NHg)  group  attached  to  carbon  1 .  Dopamine  also  can  be 
described  as  phenylethylamine  with  two  -OH  groups  attached  at  carbons  3  and  4 
(see  Figure  1)  .

Figure  1  Structure  of  dopamine  and  related  compounds 


Dopamine  is  a  white  or  almost  white  crystalline  powder.  It  is  freely 


29 


soluble  in  water,  in  methyl  alcohol,  and  in  solutions  of  alkali  hydroxides;  soluble 
in  alcohol:  sparingly  soluble  in  acetone  and  in  dichloromethane;  practically 
insoluble  in  ether  and  in  chloroform.  The  United  States  Pharmacopeia  {USP) 
gives  the  pH  of  a  4%  solution  of  dopamine  hydrochloride  (the  form  in  which  it  is 
administered  clinically)  as  between  3.0  and  5.5. 

Synthesis  and  Degradation 

Dopamine  synthesis  is  the  first  step  in  the  synthesis  of  ail  catecholamines 
in  the  body  and  constitutes  over  50%  of  all  catecholamines  found  in  brain 
(Cooper  et  al.,  1991).  Synthesis  starts  with  transport  of  the  amino  acid  tyrosine 
across  the  blood-brain  barrier  into  the  neuron.  Tyrosine  is  then  converted  to 
L-dihydroxyphenylalanine  (L-dopa)  by  tyrosine  hydroxylase,  the  rate-limiting  step 
in  the  formation  of  all  catecholamines.  L-dopa  is  then  converted  to  dopamine  by

the  enzyme  L-aromatic  amino  acid  decarboxylase  and  transported  into  synaptic 
vesicles.  In  the  formation  of  the  other  main  catecholamines  dopamine  is 
converted  to  norepinephrine  by  dopamine  p-hydroxylase,  and  then  to 
epinephrine  by  phenylethanolamine-A/-methyltransferase  (see  Figure  2). 

Dopamine  is  degraded  or  metabolized  in  two  ways:  extracelluarly  to 
homovanillic  acid  (HVA)  by  catechol-O-methyltransferase  (COMT),  and 
intracellularly  (after  re-uptake  into  the  pre-synaptic  neuron  by  the  high-affinity 
dopamine  transporter)  to  3,4-dihyoxyphenyiacetic  acid  (DOPAC)  by  monoamine 
oxidase  B  (MAOb)  (see  Figure  3). 

G-Proteins 

Dopamine  couples  to  a  family  of  receptors  known  collectively  as  G- 
protein-coupled  receptors  (guanosine  nucleotide-binding  regulatory  proteins) 
(Hedin  et  al.,  1993;  Hepler  et  al.,  1992;  Lehningeret  al.,  1993).  6-Protein- 
coupled  receptors  are  one  of  the  most  diverse  families  of  receptor  systems 
known.  This  family  of  receptor  systems  mediates  actions  that  can:  be  short-  or 
long-lasting;  regulate  ion  channels;  result  in  changes  in  growth  hormone 
expression,  gene  expression,  metabolism  and  other  disparate  outcomes. 

G-proteins  are  heterotrimer  complexes  consisting  of  an  a,  p,  and  y 
subunit.  The  a  subunit  has  a  single,  high  affinity  site  that  binds  guanosine 
triphosphate  and  guanosine  diphosphate  (GTP  and  GDP,  respectively).  When 
bound  to  GDP,  the  a  subunit  is  inactive  and  binds  tightly  to  the  Py  subunit. 

When  GTP  binds  to  the  a  subunit,  it  separates  from  the  py  subunits  and  is  active 


31 


Figure  4  G-Protein-mediated  transmembrane  signaling/  In  the  basal  state  (a),  G 
proteins  exist  as  heterotrimers  with  GDP  bound  tightly  to  the  a  subunit;  the  receptor  {H)  is 
unoccupied.  Upon  ligand  it)  binding  (b),  the  receptor  interacts  with  the  heterotrimer  to 
promote  a  conformational  change  and  dissociation  of  the  GDP  from  the  guanine  nucleotide¬ 
binding  site;  at  normal  cellular  concentrations  of  guanine  nucleotide,  GTP  fills  the  site 
immediately.  Binding  of  GTP  to  a  induces  a  conformational  change  with  two 
consequences  (c).  The  G  protein  dissociates  from  the  receptor,  freeing  the  receptor  for 
another  liaison  with  a  neighboring  quiescent  G  protein*  GTP  binding  also  reduces  the 
affinity  of  a  for  PY/  subunit  dissociation  occurs.  This  frees  a-GTP  to  fulfill  its  primary 
role  (d)  as  a  regulator  of  effectors  (El)*  At  least  in  some  systems,  the  free  py  subunit 
complex  may  also  interact  directly  with  the  effector  and  modulate  the  activity  of  the 
active  a  subunit,  or  it  may  act  independently  at  a  distinct  effector  (E2)*  The  a  subunit 
possess  an  intrinsic  GTPase  activity  (e).  The  rate  of  this  GTPase  activity  determines  the 
lifetime  of  the  active  species  and  the  associated  physiological  response.  The  a-catalyzed 
hydrolysis  of  GTP  leaves  GDP  in  the  binding  site  and  causes  deactivation  of  the  active 
complex.  The  GTPase  activity  of  a  is,  in  essence,  an  internal  clock  that  controls  an  on/off 
switch*  The  GDP  bound  form  of  ot  has  high  affinity  for  py;  subsequent  reassociation  of  a- 
GDP  with  py  returns  the  system  to  the  basal  state  (a).

and  can  then  regulate  various  effector  systems.  After  a  short  amount  of  time, 
the  intrinsic  enzyme  (GTPase)  activity  of  the  a  subunit  hydrolyzes  the  GTP  to 
GDP.  The  a  subunit  then  returns  to  reassociate  with  the  py  complex  where  it  is 
stabilized  in  association  with  the  receptor  [see  Figure  4). 

Physiologic  Roles 

Dopamine  receptors  are  divided  into  two  families:  D1  or  Dl-iike  and  D2  or 
D2-like.  The  D1  receptor  family  includes  D1  and  D5  which  share  amino  acid 
sequence  homology.  Both  of  these  receptors  are  associated  with  G-proteins 
that  increase  the  production  of  cAMP  upon  receptor  stimulation.  The  D2  family  is 
comprised  of  D2,  D3,  and  D4  receptors.  All  of  these  receptors  share  amino  acid 
sequence  homology  and  are  associated  with  G-proteins  that  inhibit  or  decrease 
the  production  of  cAMP  as  well  as  activating  potassium  (K)  channels  and  can 
inhibit  Ca^""  channel  activity.  The  D2  receptor  family  is  most  often  found 
presynaptically  (autoreceptors)  and  serve  to  decrease  DA  production  and 
release  and  modulate  DA  turnover  (Cooper  et  al.,  1991). 

Nicotine 

Tobacco-smoking  is  a  means  to  self-administer  the  addictive  drug, 
nicotine,  The  chemical  name  of  nicotine  is  (S)-3-1-Methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)pyridine 
with  the  chemical  formula  CioHuN2(see  Figure  5).  Nicotine  base  is  a  colorless 
to  pale  yellow  oily  liquid  that  turns  brown  and  gains  an  acrid  burning  odor  on 
exposure  to  air.  It  is  a  naturally-occurring  alkaloid  obtained  from  the  dried  leaves 
of  the  tobacco  plant,  nicotiana  tabacum,  nicotiana  rustics,  and  related  species 
[Solanaceae).  Tobacco  leaves  contain  2  to  8%  of  nicotine  combined  as  malate 


33 


or  citrate.  Nicotine  dihydrochloride  (CioHi4N2»2HCl),  the  salt  form  of  nicotine,  is 
a  deliquescent  white  crystal  which  is  extremely  hygroscopic. 

Nicotinic  Cholinergic  Receptors 

The  self-administration  of  nicotine  via  puffs  on  a  tobacco-containing 
product  results  in  nicotine  entering  the  body  and  reaching  the  brain  within  1 5 
seconds  (USDHHS,  1988).  Once  in  the  body,  nicotine  has  a  half-life  of  about 
two  hours.  The  drug  acts  throughout  the  body  at  nicotinic  cholinergic  receptors 
(nAChRs)  at  muscle  end  plates  and  in  autonomic  ganglia,  and  in  the  brain  at 
nAChRs  that  regulate  and  modulate  many  neurotransmitter  and  neuroendocrine 
systems.  It  is  thought  that  nAChRs  in  the  brain  are  primarily  responsible  for 
biologic  rewarding  effects  of  nicotine  (Balfour,  1994) 


The  nAChRs  all  are  similar  in  basic  physical  structure.  They  consist  of 
five  subunits  arranged  in  a  circle  to  form  a  channel.  When  an  appropriate 
agonist  binds  to  the  receptor,  the  channel  opens  and  allows  the  flow  of  positively 
charged  ions  (e.g.,  Ca^"^  or  Na^  or  other  cations,  depending  on  the  receptor 
subtype).  The  five  a-subunits  consist  of  different  types.  The  a-subunits 
(ranging  from  a2  to  a9)  contain  sites  where  agonists  (i.e.,  acetylcholine. 


34 


nicotine)  bind.  The  |3-subunits  (p2  to  P4)  are  believed  to  be  primarily  structural  in 
function.  These  nAChRs  are  distributed  presynaptically  in  certain  regions  of  the 
brain,  including  the  ventral  tegmental  area  (VTA),  nucleus  accumbens  (Nacc), 
medial  habenula,  interpenduncular  nucleus,  hypothalamus,  and  hippocampus. 

There  are  several  subgroups  of  nAChRs  that  differ  in  structure,  binding 
affinity  for  nicotine,  and  function.  The  subgroups  are  defined  according  to 
subunit  composition.  Most  binding  sites  in  the  mammalian  brain  consist  of  the 
(a4)3(P2)2  nAChR  subset  (Lindstrom  et  al.,  1995).  These  receptors  are  found 
presynaptically  and  modulate  neurotransmitter  release  (Lindstrom  et  al.,  1995; 
Nakayama  et  al.,  1994).  A  small  percentage  of  brain  nAChRs  are  composed  in 
part  of  a7  and  aS  subunits.  This  subset  of  nAChRs  appears  to  act  as 
agonist-gated  ion  channels  that  allow  calcium  to  enter  the  cell  and  initiate 
various  second  messenger  cascades  (Lindstrom  et  al.,  1995).  The  function  of 
many  of  these  combinations  is  not  yet  known. 

Nicotine's  Effects  on  Neurotransmitter  Systems 

Via  actions  at  presynaptic  (04)3(32)2  nAChRs,  nicotine  alters  activity  of 
many  different  neurotransmitter  systems,  including  those  of  dopamine, 
norepinephrine,  endogenous  opioids,  and  serotonin.  Most  of  the  work  done  on 
mechanisms  underlying  nicotine  addiction  has  focused  on  the  dopaminergic 
system  (Corrigall,  1991)  because  enhancement  of  dopamine  neurotransmission 
in  specific  brain  areas  is  believed  to  be  fundamental  to  drug  reward  or 
euphoriant  effects  (Di  Chiara  et  al.,  1993;  Koob,  1992;  Nestler,  1992),  including 
effects  of  cocaine,  heroin,  amphetamines,  and  alcohol.  In  addition,  cellular  and 


35 


molecular  changes  that  occur  in  these  brain  areas  as  a  result  of  repeated  drug 
self-administration  may  contribute  to  drug  dependence  and  addiction  (Balfour, 
1994;  Koob  et  al.,  1988a:  Koob  et  al.,  1988b).  Regions  of  the  brain  that  mediate 
reward  effects  are  phylogenetically  old  and  respond  to  natural  stimuli,  addictive 
drugs,  and  electrical  stimulation.  The  natural  stimuli  that  evoke  dopamine 
release  by  neurons  that  originate  in  the  VTA  and  terminate  in  the  NAcc  are 
associated  with  behaviors  that  are  essential  to  the  survival  of  the  individual  and 
the  species  such  as  feeding,  sexual  behavior,  birth,  care  of  offspring,  and  some 
social  behaviors  (e.g.,  mutual  grooming)  (Salamone,  1994). 

Tolerance  to  nicotine's  effects  is,  in  part,  mediated  by  increased  numbers 
of  nAChRs  (Lindstrom  et  al.,  1995)  and  also  depends  on  cellular  changes  in  the 
mesolimbic  dopamine  system  that  occur  with  repeated  nicotine 
self-administration  (Flores  et  al.,  1992).  These  changes  are  similar  to  those  that 
occur  in  response  to  other  drugs  of  abuse  and  may  include  increased  synthesis 
of  the  enzyme  tyrosine  hydroxylase  (the  rate-limiting  step  in  dopamine 
manufacture),  increased  rates  of  spontaneous  firing  activity  in  VTA  neurons,  and 
changes  in  the  structure  of  cell  bodies,  dendrites,  and  axons  (Beitner-Johnson  et 
al.,  1992;  Gold  et  al.,  1992;  Koob  et  al.,  1988a;  Ritz  et  al.,  1993).  In  the  NAcc 
chronic  addictive  drug  use  alters  G-protein  levels  and  second  messenger 
cascades,  biochemicals  that  control  rates  of  neurotransmitter  synthesis  and 
release.  These  neuronal-level  changes  reflect  the  fact  that  the  mesolimbic 
dopaminergic  neurons  adjust  to  the  repeated  presence  of  nicotine  in  a 
compensatory  way  by  developing  tolerance.

Summary 

The  present  doctoral  dissertation  research  examined  the  effects  of 
prenatal  exposure  in  rats  to  two  dosages  of  nicotine  or  saline  on  measures  of 
working  memory  {both  spatial  and  non-spatial),  sensory  gating,  activity  and 
body  weight  in  adolescent  and  adult  offspring.  Body  weight  was  included  to 
verify  drug  administration.  Locomotion  was  added  to  examine  prenatal  exposure 
effects  on  overall  activity  levels  and  also  so  that  these  levels  could  be  used  as  a 
behavioral  control  for  non-spatial  memory  (passive  avoidance).  Finally,  this 
experiment  examined  dopamine  D1  receptor  density  in  the  medial  prefrontal 
cortex,  an  area  identified  as  playing  a  role  in  visuospatial  memory  performance. 
This  area  was  examined  to  determine  if  nicotine  administration  affected 
dopamine  receptor  density,  and  the  extent  to  which  any  changes  in  this  area 
could  be  correlated  with  changes  in  memory  performance.

Hypotheses 

Hypothesis  1:  Exposure  to  nicotine  during  gestation  will  result  in  reduced  body 
weight  of  both  offspring  and  dams. 

Rationale:  It  has  been  well  established  that  nicotine  administration  reduces  the 
body  weight  of  rats  {e.g.,  Grunberg  et  al.,  1984;  Grunberg  et  ai.,  1986; 
Saah  et  al.,  1994;  Winders  et  al.,  1990).  Nicotine  administration  during 
gestation  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  body  weight  of  offspring  (e.g., 
Bertolini  et  al.,  1982;  Cutler  et  al.,  1996;  Levin  et  al.,  1998;  Slotkin  et  al., 
1993;  Sobrian  et  al.,  1995).  This  variable  has  been  included  to  confirm 
effective  administration  of  nicotine. 

Hypothesis  2:  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  result  in  impaired  radial-arm 
maze  performance  (fewer  correct  choices  made  before  an  error  is  made, 
more  total  errors  made,  and  longer  latency  to  complete). 

Rationale:  Previous  experiments  report  that  prenatal  nicotine  exposure  results 
in  general  cognitive  impairment  (e.g.,  Cutler  et  al,,  1996)  including  deficits 
in  radial-arm  maze  performance  (Yanai  et  al.,  1992).  Other  investigators, 
however,  have  reported  moderate  or  no  effects  on  radial-arm  maze 
performance  (Cutler  et  al.,  1996;  Levin  et  al.,  1993b:  Levin  et  al.,  1996b: 
Sorenson  et  al.,  1991).  These  divergent  findings  may  be  a  result  of 
different  routes  of  administration  or  of  low  dosages  of  nicotine.  It  is 
hypothesized  that  by  utilizing  appropriate  route  and  dosage  levels,  this 
experiment  will  reveal  deficits  in  radial-arm  maze  performance. 

Hypothesis  3:  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  result  In  impaired  water  maze 


38 


performance  (longer  latencies  to  find  the  hidden  platform). 

Rationale:  This  hypothesis  follows  from  rationale  for  hypothesis  2  and  is  based 
on  previous  work  (Cutler  et  al.,  1996;  Levin  et  al.,  1993b:  Levin  et  al., 
1996b:  Yanai  et  al.,  1992)  that  reported  little  or  no  effect  of  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine.  Again,  these  experiments  utilized  potentially 
inappropriate  routes  of  administration  and  dosages  of  nicotine  and  it  is 
hypothesized  that  by  utilizing  appropriate  route  and  dosage  levels,  this 
experiment  will  reveal  deficits  in  water  maze  performance.  Additionally, 
previous  reports  have  indicated  that  water  maze  performance  is 
compromised  by  altering  dopaminergic  and  nicotinic  cholinergic  systems 
(e.g.,  Brandels  et  al,,  1989;  McNamara  et  al.,  1993). 

Hypothesis  4:  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  result  in  impaired  passive 

avoidance  performance  (shorter  latencies  to  cross,  or  larger  proportion  of 
subjects  crossing). 

Rationale:  Previous  reports  have  indicated  that  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine 
results  in  impaired  or  altered  avoidance  (both  passive  and  active) 
performance  (Bertolini  et  al.,  1982;  Genedani  et  al.,  1983;  Peters  et  al., 

■'V.  1982). 

Hypothesis  5:  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  result  in  altered  acoustic  startle 
response  and  will  impair  PPI  (smaller  amounts  of  inhibition  on  trials  with 
pre-pulse). 

Rationale:  A  previous  report  (Popke  et  al.,  1997)  has  indicated  that  prenatal 
nicotine  exposure  may  alter  acoustic  startle  performance.  Additionally, 


39 


this  measure  can  be  considered  an  animal  model  for  attention, 
information  processing  or  sensory-gating  {Acri  et  al.,  1991 ;  Acri  et  a)., 
1994;  Caine  et  a).,  1992;  Swerdlow  et  a!.,  1992),  and  it  follows  from 
epidemiologic  findings  in  humans  that  report  impaired  attentional  and 
sensory-gating  in  children  of  smoking  mothers  {Denson  et  ai.,  1975; 
Landesman-Dwyer  et  at.,  1979;  Streissguth,  1984)  that  similar  results  may 
be  found  in  rats  exposed  to  nicotine  prenatally. 

Hypothesis  6:  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  result  in  increased  locomotor 
activity. 

Rationale:  This  hypothesis  is  based  on  previous  findings  in  rats  (Fung  et  al., 

1988;  Richardson  et  al.,  1994;  Tizabi  et  al.,  1997)  and  in  humans  (Denson 
et  al.,  1975;  Kristjansson  et  al.,  1989;  Sorenson  et  al.,  1991)  that  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine  resulted  in  higher  levels  of  activity. 

Hypothesis  7:  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  result  in  altered  D1  binding 

density  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex.  ~  -  - 

Rationale:  This  hypothesis  is  based  on  the  compiiation  of  several  factors: 

1 )  previous  reports  that  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  alters 
catecholaminergic  systems  (Fung,  1989;  Levin  et  al.,  1998;  Lichtensteiger 
et  al.,  1987;  Navarro  et  al.,  1988;  Ribary  et  al.,  1989);  2)  chronic 
stimulation  of  receptor  systems  results  in  altered  receptor  density  (Cooper 
et  al.,  1991 ;  Fung  et  al.,  1991);  3)  nicotine  stimulates  the  DA  system 
(Balfour,  1994;  Balfour  et  al.,  1993;  Fung  etal.,  1991;  Fung  etal.,  1992). 

Hypothesis  8:  A  significant  inverse  correlation  between  D1  receptor  density  and 


40 


memory  performance  will  be  revealed. 

Rationale:  This  hypothesis  follows  from  hypothesis  7  and  from  previous  work 
that  indicates  D1  receptors  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  are  involved  in 
working  memory  performance  (e.g.,  Goldman-Rakic,  1995;  Sawaguchi  et 
a!.,  1991;  Sawaguchi  etal.,  1994). 

Hypothesis  9:  Effects  of  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  will  be  revealed 
differently  based  on  age  of  testing. 

Rationale:  This  hypothesis  is  based  on  previous  reports  in  humans  that  effects 
of  prenatal  exposure  to  cigarette  smoke  may  be  long-lasting  but  may  also 
disappear  by  adulthood  (e.g.,  Denson  et  al.,  1975;  Fogelman  et  al.,  1988; 
Fried  et  al.,  1992;  Fried  et  al.,  1990). 


Methods 


Subjects: 

Subject  animals  were  male  and  female  offspring  of  15  timed-pregnant 
Sprague-Dawley  rats  (Charles  River  Laboratories,  Wilmington,  MA).  This 
particular  strain  of  animals  has  been  chosen  in  order  to  replicate  and  expand  on 
previous  work  investigating  effects  of  prenatal  nicotine  {Levin  et  al.,  1993b: 
Popke  et  al.,  1997;  Tizabi  et  al.,  1997).  Animals  were  maintained  in  a 
temperature  (23 “C)  and  humidity  (roughly  50%  relative  humidity)  controlled 
environment.  Light-dark  cycles  were  12-12  hours  (lights  off  at  0700),  Standard 
laboratory  rat  chow  (Harlan  Teklad,  4%  Mouse/Rat  Diet  7001)  and  tap  water 
were  available  continuously  in  the  home  cage  except  immediately  prior  to  and 
during  radial-arm  maze  testing  (see  below)  when  food  was  restricted  such  that 
each  rat  maintained  80-85%  maximum  body  weight  {see  Figure  13). 

Fifteen  timed -pregnant  female  rats  were  delivered  to  the  animal  housing 
facility  on  gestational  day  2  (GD2)  and  were  implanted  on  GD4  (before  embryo 
implantation  to  the  uterine  wall)  with  osmotic  minipumps  (see  below)  containing 
either  saline  or  one  of  two  doses  of  nicotine  (n=5  per  group).  One  dam  in  the  12 
mg/kg  group  was  either  not  pregnant  or  spontaneously  resorbed  her  fetuses. 
Fetal  resorbtion  has  been  reported  to  occur  under  high  doses  of  nicotine  (Levin 
et  al.,  1998;  Slotkin,  1992).  All  remaining  dams  delivered  on  GD22.  Two  dams 
in  the  12  mg/kg  group  rejected  their  offspring  after  parturition  and  all  offspring 
from  those  dams  died.  Previously,  dams  have  rejected  their  offspring  in  earlier 
experiments  in  this  laboratory  and  in  pilot  studies  (unpublished  data)  that  used 


41 


42 


lower  doses  of  nicotine  or  that  did  not  utilize  nicotine  at  all.  Therefore,  it  is 
unlikely  that  the  dams  rejected  their  offspring  in  this  experiment  because  of 
nicotine  administration.  Litters  from  the  remaining  dams  were  cross-fostered  24 
hours  after  parturition  between  dams  within  each  treatment  group  to  control  litter 
size  {n=1 1  per  dam)  and  to  assure  continuation  of  nicotine  administration  via 
breast  milk  until  the  end  of  the  effective  pump-life  of  the  minipump  (21.1  days). 
The  sex  of  each  of  the  offspring  was  determined  and  each  was  weighed  at  the 
time  of  cross-fostering.  Offspring  were  weaned  on  post-natal  day  23  (PND  23) 
and  moved  to  same-sex  cages  of  4-6  animals  each.  On  PND  35  three  males 
and  three  females  were  chosen  quasi-randomly  (based  on  body  weight)  from 
each  dam  for  experimentation  and  housed  two  per  cage.  All  offspring  from  the 
remaining  12  mg/kg  dams  (1 1  males  and  1 1  females)  were  used.  Final  count  for 
the  experiment  was  82  rats  —  1 5  males  and  15  females  each  from  the  0  and  6 
mg/kg  groups  and  1 1  males  and  1 1  females  from  the  1 2  mg/kg  group.  All  82 
animals  were  tested  on  all  measures.  Testing  occurred  during  adolescence 
(after  PND  40)  and  during  adulthood  (after  PND  60).  On  any  given  testing  day, 
only  one  measure  was  performed  to  reduce  any  potential  confounds  that 
performing  multiple  tests/handling  session  may  (see  Results  section  below  for 
exact  dates  of  each  measure).  This  sample  size  was  based  on  previous 
empirical  investigations  (unpublished  pilot  data),  personal  communications  with 
other  laboratories  conducting  similar  work  (similar  experiments  have  been 
performed  with  as  few  as  7  offspring  per  group;  personal  communication, 

Edward  Levin,  Ph.D.,  Duke  University,  NC,  1997),  and  on  power  analyses  to 


43 


ensure  that  sufficient  statistical  power  was  achieved. 

Drug: 

Nicotine  dihydrochloride  (0,  6,  or  1 2  mg/kg/day  —  expressed  as  base) 
was  dissolved  in  physiologic  saline  and  placed  in  Alzet  osmotic  minipumps 
(Model  2002,  Alza  Corp.,  Palo  Alto,  CA).  These  minipumps  were  used  because 
they  are  small  (3.0  cm)  and  cause  no  discernable  discomfort  or  distress  to  the 
rat.  The  minipumps  administer  their  contents  at  a  constant  rate  (0.48  pi  per 
hour)  throughout  the  delivery  period  (21.1  days),  and  avoid  problems  associated 
with  repeated  daily  injections.  This  type  of  minipump  also  has  been  used 
successfully  in  previous  investigations  of  adult  and  prenatal  nicotine 
administration  (Grunberg,  1982;  Levin  et  al.,  1993b;  Murrin  et  al.,  1987;  Navarro 
et  al.,  1988;  Ribary  et  al.,  1989;  Richardson  et  al.,  1994;  Seidler  et  a!..  1992; 
Siotkin  etal.,  1987b).

Dams  were  randomly  assigned  to  drug  groups  (n=5).  Minipumps  were 
surgically  implanted.  Animals  were  anesthetized  by  inhalation  of  Metophane™ 
(methoxyfiurane,  Pitman-Moore,  Mundelein,  IL).  Each  animal  was  placed  into  a 
bell  jar  containing  gauze  soaked  with  2-4  ml  of  Metophane^w^  jhg  jar  was 
located  in  a  ventilated  hood  to  isolate  fumes.  The  rat  was  removed  from  the  jar 
when  a  tail  pinch  produced  no  reflex  (approximately  1 .5-2.0  min).  A  4  cm  square 
patch  was  shaved  on  the  back  of  the  rat.  This  area  was  then  swabbed  with  a 
betadine  solution  (The  Purdue  Frederick  Co.,  Norwalk,  CT).  A  2  cm  horizontal 
midline  incision  was  made  between  the  withers  and  a  subcutaneous  pocket  was 


44 


formed  into  which  the  minipump  was  inserted  with  the  flow  moderator  cephalad. 
Incisions  were  closed  with  9  mm  stainless  steel  Autoclip™  wound  clips 
(Stoelting,  Wood  Dale,  IL).  Clips  are  designed  to  fall  out  after  several  days. 
Pumps  were  not  removed. 

Apparatus 


Video  Tracking  System 

Each  test  session  on  the  radial-arm  maze  and  water  maze  was  recorded 
using  a  computerized  video  tracking  system  (Polytrack  System,  San  Diego  Inst., 
San  Diego,  CA).  This  system  consisted  of  a  video  camera  mounted  above  the 
maze  connected  to  a  computer  interface.  Using  this  system  each  maze  was 
traced  into  the  computer.  The  system  then  tracks  light  objects  against  a  dark 
background,  plots  the  object’s  path  onto  the  screen,  and  records,  several 
parameters,  including  path  length,  and  test  session  latency  (see  Figure  6).

Mazes 

The  idea  that  animals,  particularly  rats,  can  and  do  use  spatial  information 
to  orient  themselves  in  the  world,  and  that  they  form  cognitive  maps  of  the  world 
is  not  a  new  one.  Tolman  posited  that  "in  the  course  of  learning  something  like  a 
field  map  of  the  environment  gets  established  in  the  rats  brain”  (Tolman,  1943,  p 
192).  An  example  of  the  importance  of  spatial  memory  in  animal  survival  is  the 
Hawai’ian  honeycreeper  {Kamil,  1978).  This  small  Hawai’ian  bird  feeds  on  the 
nectar  of  flowers.  Each  flower  only  provides  a  small  amount  of  nectar  upon  each 
visit  the  bird  makes  to  it.  To  maximize  the  amount  of  food  that  the  bird  can 
derive  from  a  day’s  feeding,  the  bird  must  remember  where  each  flower  is  in  its 
territory  and  visit  each  one  several  times  throughout  the  day.  This  foraging 
behavior  is  common  to  many  species  of  animals  and  is  an  ethologically  valid 
measure  of  memory  in  animals  (Olton,  1977). 

The  mazes  were  placed  in  a  room  with  extra-maze  visual  cues  of  two 
types:  large  extra-maze  objects  and  luminosity  gradients.  As  explained  by 
Kraemer  and  colleagues  (1 996),  extra-maze  visual  cues  and  luminosity 
gradients  across  the  maze  space  are  presumed  to  provide  critical  spatial 
information  to  the  rat  necessary  for  accurate  maze  performance  (Morris,  1981 ; 
Olton  et  al.,  1979b).  Large  extra- maze  objects  consisted  of  experimental 
equipment  and  black-and-white  squares  of  different  patterns  placed  on  several 
walls  adjacent  to  the  mazes.  A  luminosity  gradient  was  created  by  placing 
spotlights  around  the  radial-arm  maze  such  that  the  "south”  (arbitrary 
designation)  wall  was  a  brightly-lit  wall  painted  sand  color  in  high-gloss  paint,  the 


46 


“east”  and  “west”  walls  were  not  lit,  providing  a  general  “southward"  luminosity 
gradient  across  the  maze  space.  A  luminosity  gradient  was  created  around  the 
water  maze  using  spotlights  such  that  the  “south"  wall  was  brightly  lit,  the  “east” 
wall  was  not  as  brightly  lit  and  had  a  large  black  door  that  occluded  the  entire 
“north"  halt  of  the  wall,  the  "north"  and  “west"  walls  were  open  to  the  rest  of  the 
room  showing  distal  objects  placed  around  the  room  (i.e.,  other  large 
experimental  equipment,  computer,  experimenter,  etc.).  The  experimenter  stood 
in  the  same  place  during  all  water  maze  trials.  This  additional  set  of  stimuli  may 
be  particularly  important  when  considering  the  overall  poor  visual  acuity  of 
un pigmented  rats.  The  luminosity  gradient  {see  Figure  7),  in  addition  to

the  experimental  room.  Note  the  light  sets  used 
to  create  luminosity  gradients  (the  overhead 
flourescent  lights  were  not  used  during  testing) 
and  the  large  black  door  mentioned  in  the  text 


47 

extremely  large  and  salient  visual  cues  (the  presence  or  absence  of  a  wall,  the 
large  black  door  in  an,  othenwise  uninterrupted,  wall)  may  be  functionally 
superior  to  those  cues  which  a  human  may  find  particularly  salient  (Olton,  1977). 

Radiat-Arm  Maze 

Testing  occurred  in  an  eight-arm  radial-arm  maze  constructed  of  opaque, 
non-reflective  black  Plexiglas  walls  placed  on  a  circular  121  cm  diameter  non- 
reflective  black  plastic  mat.  The  radial-arm  maze  consisted  of  a  36  cm  diameter 
central  area  with  eight  43  x  12  .5  x  30  cm  arms  (I  x  w  x  h)  extending  radially. 

Food  cups  were  placed  at  the  distal  end  of  each  arm.  The  protocol  followed  the 
method  of  Olton  (1976)  as  modified  by  Levin  (1996a).  Specifically,  beginning  on 
PND  35  food  was  restricted  such  that  male  and  female  animals  received  15  g  or 
12  g  of  food  each,  respectively.  On  PND  38  the  animals  were  introduced  to  the 
maze  and  allowed  to  explore  it  for  5  min.  Food  rewards  consisted  of  one-half  to 
one-third  piece  of  Kellogg’s  Froot  Loops®  breakfast  cereal  (Kellogg’s,  Battle 
Creek,  Ml).  Preliminary  investigation  revealed  that  smaller  pieces  were  more 
reinforcing  {i.e.,  rats  took  less  time  to  consume  each  individual  reward  and  spent 
less  time  searching  around  and  under  the  food  cups  and  moved  on  to  the  next 
arm  more  quickly).  Food  rewards  were  placed  in  the  food  cups  at  the  end  of 
each  arm.  Each  trial  began  by  placing  the  rat  in  a  25  x  25  cm  cardboard  cylinder 
in  the  center  of  the  maze.  After  10  s,  the  cylinder  was  lifted  and  the  rat  was 
permitted  to  move  about  the  maze  until  all  eight  arms  had  been  entered  and 
food  rewards  eaten  or  until  5  min  had  elapsed.  A  correct  entry  was  counted 
when  the  rat  entered  the  arm,  proceeded  to  the  end,  and  removed  the  food 


48 


reward.  Because  food  was  not  replaced  once  eaten,  an  error  was  counted  when 
the  rat  entered  an  arm  which  it  had  previously  eaten  the  food.  The  number  of 
correct  entries  made  before  an  error  was  made  (entries  to  repeat),  the  total 
number  of  subsequent  errors  and  latency  to  find  all  food  rewards  were  recorded. 
Testing  occurred  once  daily  for  7  days  beginning  on  PND  37  and  again  on  PND 
62  for  4  days.  On  the  last  day  of  testing,  food  hoppers  were  filled  completely  at 
the  end  of  the  day  and  rats  were  allowed  to  eat  ad  libitum.  Entries  to  repeat, 
number  of  errors,  and  latency  to  complete  were  analyzed  using  repeated- 
measures  multivariate  analyses  of  variance  (MANOVA),  with  time  as  the  within- 
subjects  factor  and  drug  and  sex  as  the  between-subjects  factor.  When 
significant  differences  between  sexes  were  revealed,  analyses  were  repeated  for 
each  sex  separately.  Additional  univariate  analyses  of  variance  (ANOVA)  were 
performed  at  each  time  point  when  overall  significance  was  revealed  using  the 
repeated-measures  MANOVA.  Differences  between  groups  was  determined 
using  the  Tukey-HSD  or  Dunnett’s  tpost  hoc  analyses. 

Water  Maze 

Experiments  were  conducted  in  a  Morris  water  maze  (Morris, 
1981)following  the  procedure  of  Levin  and  colleagues  (1996)  and  Lindner  and 
colleagues  (1992).  The  water  maze  was  a  circular,  dark  blue  plastic  tank  200 
cm  in  diameter  (180  cm  in  diameter  at  water  level)  and  50  cm  high.  The  escape 
platform  was  a  dark  acrylic  1 2.5  cm  square  platform  mounted  on  a  clear  30  cm 
high  acrylic  base.  The  maze  space  was  conceptually  divided  into  four  quadrants 
(/.a,  north-west,  north-east,  etc.).  The  platform  was  placed  in  one  of  four 


49 


quadrants  in  the  maze,  equally  distant  (50  cm)  from  each  orthogonal  wall,  on 
each  of  the  test  days.  The  maze  was  filled  with  30 “C  (±1  °C)  water  until  the 
escape  platform  was  1  cm  below  the  surface;  deep  enough  not  to  be  seen  or 
cause  ripples  from  surface  agitation,  but  shallow  enough  so  that  the  rat  was  out 
of  the  water  once  it  stood  on  the  platform.  The  task  was  a  delayed  matching  to 
position  task.  Specifically,  each  trial  consisted  of  two  blocks  separated  by  60  s. 
Previous  experiments  using  the  water  maze  (Cutler  et  al.,  1996;  Lindner  et  al., 
1992)  have  determined  that  various  intervals  between  trials  (e.g.,  15,  30,  60,  or 
80  s)  do  not  significantly  affect  performance  on  the  second  trial.  Therefore,  the 
latency  of  60  s  was  chosen  for  logistical  reasons.  In  the  first  block,  each  rat  was 
placed  in  the  water  facing  the  wall  in  a  randomly  chosen  quadrant  (using  the 
random  number  generator  function  in  Corel,  Quattro  Pro^*^)  and  allowed  to 
search  for  the  escape  platform  which  was  marked  by  a  bright  white  acrylic  box 
that  extended  above  the  surface  of  the  water  by  2.5  cm  and  below  the  surface 
by  10  cm.  After  the  rat  found  the  marked  platform,  it  was  allowed  to  stay  on  it  for 
15  s.  All  rats  found  the  marked  platform  within  the  allowed  time.  Then  the  rat 
was  removed  from  the  maze  and  placed  in  a  20  gal  plastic  bucket  with  several 
dry  towels  in  it  for  60  s.  The  holding  bucket  was  moved  each  day  to  match  the 
position  of  the  escape  platform.  This  was  done  so  that  the  rat  would  not  learn 
the  position  of  the  bucket  and  perseverate  in  that  quadrant  rather  than 
proceeding  to  the  platform.  During  the  delay,  the  white  acrylic  box  was  removed 
from  the  escape  platform.  The  rat  was  then  placed  back  in  the  water  in  the 
same  starting  position  and  allowed  to  search  for  the,  now  hidden,  platform.  If  the 


50 


rat  found  the  platform  within  3  min,  it  was  immediately  removed  from  the  maze 
and  placed  in  a  cage  with  a  dry  towel  in  it.  If  the  rat  failed  to  find  the  platform 
within  3  min,  then  it  was  guided  there,  and  allowed  to  remain  for  15  s  before 
being  removed.  All  rats  were  toweled  dry  at  the  end  of  each  session  and 
returned  to  their  home  cages.  Latency  to  reach  the  marked  platform,  the 
unmarked  platform,  and  distance  traveled  to  each  was  recorded.  Testing  began 
on  PND  50,  occurred  once  daily  for  5  days,  and  again  beginning  on  PND  69. 
Latency  to  find  the  unmarked  platform  data  were  analyzed  using  repeated- 
measures  MANOVA,  with  time  as  the  with  in-subjects  factor  and  drug  and  sex  as 
the  between-subjects  factor.  When  significant  differences  between  sexes  were 
revealed,  analyses  were  repeated  for  each  sex  separately.  Additional 
MANOVAs  were  performed  at  each  time  point  when  overall  significance  was 
revealed  using  the  repeated-measures  MANOVA.  Differences  between  groups 
was  determined  using  the  Tukey-HSD  post  hoc  analysis. 

Passive  Avoidance 

Shuttlebox  passive-avoidance  {often  referred  to  as  inhibitory  avoidance)  is 
considered  to  be  an  index  of  general  cognition  or  memory  performance  in 
animals  (Decker,  1995;  Doyle  et  al.,  1993;  Riekkinen  et  al.,  1993).  In  this  task, 
the  animal  must  inhibit  a  naturally  occurring  drive  to  move  out  of  a  lit  space  into  a 
dark  space.  Bertolini  and  colleagues  (1982)  used  cigarette  smoke  inhalation  to 
pregnant  dams  administered  twice  per  day.  They  reported  no  significant 
differences  in  number  of  rats  that  reached  criterion.  This  study  is  flawed, 
however,  because  of  the  route  of  administration.  Not  only  was  nicotine  not 


51 


administered  in  a  robust  fashion,  but  there  is  no  way  to  identify  the  dosage  of 
nicotine  administered.  Additionally,  as  mentioned  above,  smoke  inhalation  also 
administers  a  host  of  other,  potentially  hanmful  substances  {e.g.,  carbon 
monoxide)  that  may  affect  cognition. 

Animals  were  trained  using  a  protocol  used  previously  by  the  author 
(Rahman  et  al.,  1996)  that  is  based  on  published  reports  (Decker,  1995;  Decker 
et  al.,  1993)  utilizing  an  automated  avoidance  training  system  (Gemini,  San 


Figure  8  Shuttlebox  -  passive  avoidance 
apparatus 


Diego  Instruments,  San  Diego,  CA).  The  apparatus  consisted  of  two 
21  X  25  X  17  cm  chambers  separated  by  a  vertically-sliding  door  (see  Figure  S). 
Lighting  in  the  chambers  was  provided  by  a  50  watt  bulb  located  3  cm  above  the 
translucent  plastic  ceiling.  Scrambled,  constant-current  shocks  (0.8  mA  for  1  s) 
were  delivered  through  a  grid  floor.  Control  of  the  door,  lighting,  and  shock  was 
provided  by  means  of  an  interfaced  486  computer  running  proprietary  software 
(“PA,"  San  Diego  Instruments,  San  Diego,  CA).  Training  and  testing  procedures 
were  identical  and  began  by  placing  the  animal  in  one  chamber  of  the  darkened 


52 


apparatus.  After  a  delay  of  60  s,  the  50  watt  light  came  on  in  the  start  chamber 
and  the  door  opened  to  the  other,  darkened  chamber.  When  the  rat  crossed 
completely  into  the  darkened  chamber,  the  door  closed,  a  0.8  mA  shock  was 
delivered  for  1  s,  and  latency  to  cross  was  recorded.  The  rat  was  then 
immediately  removed  from  the  chamber.  Because  passive  avoidance  can  only 
be  performed  once  to  control  for  learning  effects  on  subsequent  test  days,  rats 
were  trained  on  the  procedure  on  PND  55  and  tested  24  hours  later,  this 
particular  timing  for  the  test  was  chosen  as  a  mid-point  between  the  two  testing 
periods  used  for  the  other  behavioral  measures.  Shock  was  not  administered  on 
the  test  day.  All  rats  crossed  into  the  darkened  chamber  on  the  training  day.  If 
the  rat  did  cross  into  the  other  chamber  on  the  test  day,  it  was  removed  after  300 
s.  Because  the  latency  data  are  bounded  and  non-normally  distributed  they 
could  not  be  analyzed  parametrically.  The  data  were  recoded  into  binary  data  — 
that  is,  whether  the  rat  did  or  did  not  cross  within  the  300  s  time  —  and  were 
analyzed  using  Chi-square  analysis.  Additionally,  the  actual  latency  data  were 
analyzed  using  the  Kruskal-Wallis  one-way  analysis  of  variance  by  ranks  test  a 
nonparametric  equivalent  to  one-way  {Siegel  et  al.,  1988,  p.  206)  that  tests 
whether  k  independent  samples  are  from  different  populations. 

Acoustic  Startle 

The  Acoustic  Startle  Reflex  (ASR)  and  pre-pulse  inhibition  (PPI)  of  the 
ASR  are  behavioral  responses  believed  to  index  central  processes  related  to 
information  processing  (Caine  et  al.,  1992;  Swerdlow  et  al.,  1992)  and  possibly 
attention  (Acri,  1994;  Acri  et  al.,  1995;  Acri  et  al.,  1991 ;  Acri  et  al.,  1994).  The 


53 


acoustic  startle  reflex  is  a  characteristic  sequence  of  involuntary,  muscular 
responses  elicited  by  a  sudden,  intense  acoustic  stimulus  (Davis,  1984). 
Jumping  in  response  to  an  unexpected  car  backfire  is  an  everyday  example  of 
the  startle  reflex.  The  reflex  is  present  in  all  mammals,  including  humans  and 
rats,  and  is  considered  an  index  of  reactivity  to  external  acoustic  stimuli.  In 
addition,  because  the  reflex  can  be  elicited  using  the  same  stimuii  across 
species  (Swerdlow  et  al.,  1994),  the  paradigm  has  face  validity  for  generalizing 
from  an  animal  model  to  human  issues. 

Pre-pulse  inhibition  (PPI)  of  the  acoustic  startle  reflex  (ASR)  occurs  when 
the  startling  stimulus  is  preceded  by  a  non-startling  acoustic  stimulus  by  a  short 
interval  (about  100  msec).  The  presence  of  the  pre-pulse  results  in  measurably 
reduced  startle  amplitude  (Braff  et  al.,  1978;  Graham,  1975).  In  the  everyday 
example  of  a  car  backfire,  the  ability  of  this  loud  noise  to  startle  would  be 
reduced  if  the  listener  also  heard  the  engine  sounds  immediately  preceding  the 
backfire.  This  reduction  in  startle  amplitude  is  pre-pulse  inhibition  of  the  ASR. 

As  with  the  ASR,  the  phenomenon  of  pre-pulse  inhibition  occurs  in  humans  and 
in  rats.  Pre-pulse  inhibition  is  believed  to  index  an  innate  sensory-cognitive- 
motor  “gating"  mechanism  that  operates  at  a  non-volitional  or  pre-cognitive  level 
and  underlies  the  organism’s  ability  to  select  relevant  stimuli  from  the 
environment  while  screening  out  irrelevant  information  (Swerdlow  et  al.,  1992). 
PPI  also  has  been  interpreted  to  reflect  processes  associated  with  attention  (Acri 
et  al.,  1991;  Acri  et  al.,  1994),  and  in  humans  PPI  is  negatively  correlated  with 
distract! bility  (Karperetal.,  1996). 


54 


Acoustic  startle  reflex  amplitudes  and  pre-pulse  inhibition  were  measured 
in  a  Coulbourn  Instruments  Acoustic  Response  Test  System  (Coulbourn 
Instruments,  Allentown,  PA)  {see  Figure  9).  The  Acoustic  Response  Test 
System  consisted  of  four  weight-sensitive  platforms  inside  a  sound -attenuated 
chamber  (see  Figure  10).  Subjects’  movements  in  response  to  stimuli  were 
measured  as  a  voltage  change  by  a  strain  gauge  inside  each  platform  and  were 
converted  to  grams  of  body  weight  change  following  analog  to  digital  conversion. 
Responses  were  recorded  by  an  interfaced  computer  as  the  maximum  response 
occurring  within  200  msec  of  the  onset  of  the  startle-eliciting  stimulus.  Each  rat 
was  individually  placed  in  a  8  x  8  x  1 6  cm  open  air  cage.  The  open  air  cages 
are  small  enough  to  restrict  extensive  locomotion  but  large  enough  to  allow  the 
subject  to  turn  around  and  make  other  small  movements.  Each  open  air  cage 
then  was  placed  on  one  of  the  four  platforms.  The  platforms  were  arranged 
radially  around  central  speakers  in  the  floor  and  ceiling  of  the  chamber.  A 

*  j 

ventilating  fan  provided  an  ambient  noise  level  of  56  dB.  Following  placement  of 

ti  , 

four  animals  in  the  chamber,  a  3-minute  adaptation  period  occurred  in  which  no 
startle  stimuli  were  presented.  Although  it  has  been  reported  that  some  rats  emit 
ultrasonic  vocalizations  during  startle  testing  (Haney  et  al.,  1994;  Vivian  et  al., 
1993),  there  is  no  evidence  indicating  that  vocalizations  alter  startle  responses. 
However,  to  ensure  minimal  effects  of  vocalizations  should  they  occur,  subjects 
were  balanced  across  treatment  groups  within  each  testing  session. 


Startle  stimuli  consisted  of  112,  122  or  98  dB  noise  bursts  of  20  msec 
duration  sometimes  preceded  100  msec  by  68  dB  1  KHz  pure  tone  (pre-pulse). 


55 


Decibel  levels  previously  have  been  verified  by  a  Larson-Davis  Sound  Pressure 
Machine  Model  2800  (unweighted  scale;  re:  0.0002  dynes/cm^).  Each  stimulus 
has  a  2  msec  rise  and  decay  time  such  that  onset  and  offset  are  abrupt  and  in  a 
square-wave  pattern,  a  primary  criterion  for  startle  (Cassella  et  al.,  1986).  There 
were  eight  types  of  stimulus  trials,  and  each  trial  type  was  presented  eight  times, 
for  a  total  of  64  trials.  Trial  types  were  presented  in  random  order  to  avoid  order 
effects  and  habituation.  Inter-trial  intervals  ranged  randomly  from  10-30  sec. 
Trial  types  included:  (1)  1 12  dB  stimulus,  (2)  1 12  dB  stimulus  preceded  by  a  68 
dB  pre-pulse,  (3)  122  dB  stimulus,  (4)  122  dB  stimulus  preceded  by  a  68  dB  pre¬ 
pulse,  (5)  98  dB  stimulus,  (6)  98  dB  stimulus  preceded  by  a  68  dB  pre-pulse,  (9) 
68  dB  pre-pulse  only,  and  (8)  no  stimulus.  The  testing  period  lasted 
approximately  30  min.  Open-air  cages  were  washed  with  soap  and  warm  water 
and  dried  after  each  use.  Males  and  females  were  tested  in  separate  test 
chambers.  Treatment  groups  were  balanced  within  each  chamber  for  each 
measurement  session.

Trials  during  which  no  stimuli  are  presented  were  used  to  control  for 
normal  subject  movements  on  the  platform.  This  information  is  necessary  in

order  to  accurately  calculate  platform  displacement  that  occurs  in  response  to 
specific  noise  stimuli.  To  derive  these  values,  platform  displacement  on  the  no- 
stimulus  trials  (i.e.,  the  body  weight  of  each  subject)  was  from  platform 
displacement  in  response  to  the  various  noise  stimuli,  leaving  only  the  amount  of 
platform  displacement  related  to  the  stimulus.  Additionally,  in  order  to  acclimate 
the  subjects  with  the  experimental  procedure,  the  subjects  were  placed  in  the 
ASR  apparatus  on  two  separate  days  and  sounds  were  presented  as  explained 
above,  however,  the  data  for  acclimation  days  were  not  analyzed.  Several  days 
later  on  PND  48  and  PND  67,  true  measures  of  ASR  were  performed  and  data 
were  kept  and  analyzed.  This  protocol  has  been  empirically  derived  in  this 
laboratory  in  order  to  reduce  the  amount  of  spurious  activity  (or  freezing)  during 
the  procedure  without  habituating  the  response  (unpublished  empirical  data). 
Amplitude  of  startle  (in  grams),  amount  PPI  and  percent  PPI  were  calculated  and 
analyzed  using  ANOVA. 

Locomotor 

Locomotor  activity  is  a  sensitive,  reliable  measure  commonly  used  to 
evaluate  effects  of  drugs  and  stress  on  behavior.  It  was  used  in  the  present 


Figure  1 1  Locomotor  apparatus 


57 


experiment  to  assess  prenatal  nicotine  effects  on  open  field  activity.  In  addition, 
locomotion  was  used  to  control  for  the  potential  confound  of  activity  level  on 
memory  performance  tasks  that  required  lack  of  movement  (PA)  (Decker  et  al., 
1993).  Subjects  were  placed  individually  in  an  Omnitech  Electronics  Digiscan 
infrared  photocell  system  (Test  box  model  RXYZCM)  which  consisted  of  a  40  X 
40  X  30  cm  clear  plexiglass  arena  surrounded  by  an  array  of  infra-red  photo¬ 
beams  {see  Figure  11).  Males  and  females  were  tested  separately. 

Spontaneous  locomotor  was  automatically  gathered  and  transmitted  to  a 
personal  computer  via  an  Omnitech  Model  DCM-8-BBU  analyzer.  Animals  were 
monitored  continuously  for  a  2-hour  period  with  data  recorded  as  cumulative 
activity  over  5  minute  time  periods.  Testing  occurred  on  PND  46  and  PND  60. 
Animals  were  acclimated  to  the  experimental  procedure,  as  described  above,  but 
these  data  were  not  analyzed.  Analyses  of  variance  were  performed  on; 
horizontal  activity  (number  of  beams  broken),  total  distance  (in  cm),  number  of 
discrete  movements,  vertical  activity  (number  of  vertical  beam  breaks),  number 
of  discrete  vertical  movements,  time  spent  vertical,  distance  traveled  and  time 
spent  in  the  center  of  the  open  field  and  margins.  Each  sex  was  analyzed 
separately  because  it  has  previously  been  reported  that  normal,  untreated  male 
and  female  rats  emit  different  patterns  of  locomotor  activity  (Faraday  et  al., 
1998b).  Additionally,  locomotor  activity  data  were  entered  into  a  multiple 
regression  and  correlation  (MRC)  analysis  along  with  sex  and  drug  treatment  as 
predictor  variables  for  passive  avoidance  performance  data  to  determine  if  these 
variables  significantly  accounted  for  variance  in  passive  avoidance  data.

Neurochemistry 

Dopamine  Receptor  Autoradiography 

Rat  brains  were  immediately  removed  after  decapitation  and  snap-frozen 
by  immersion  into  powdered  dry  ice  and  were  stored  at  -80°C  until  sectioning, 
Consecutive  coronal  brain  sections  (18pm  thick)  were  cut  using  a  motor-driven 
cryostat  (Microm  HM  505E,  Carl  Zeiss  Inc.,  Thorn  wood,  NY)  at  -20  “C  and  thaw- 
mounted  onto  chrome-alum  gelatine-coated  glass  microscope  slides  and  stored 
not  more  than  one  week  at  '80°C  until  assay.  Sections  were  made  3. 2-2. 6  mm 
anterior  to  bregma  as  identified  by  Garris  and  colleagues  (1993). 
Autoradiography  was  performed  on  one  slide  with  four  sections  for  each  animal. 

Dopamine  D1  receptor  autoradiography  was  performed  using  the 
selective  D1  agonist  [^®®I]SCH  23982  (R(-i-)-8[’^®l]-iodo-7-hydroxy-2, 3,4,5- 
tetrahydro-3methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benazepine,  New  England  Nuclear  Life 
Science  Products,  Boston,  MA)  using  the  method  developed  by  Dawson  and 
colleagues  (1990)  with  modifications  (Bonhomme  et  al.,  1995;  Leslie  et  al.,  1987; 
Leslie  et  al.,  1991;  Picciotto  et  al.,  1997;  Schambra  et  al,,  1994).  Specifically, 
slide-mounted  sections  were  allowed  to  come  to  room  temperature,  removed 
from  the  storage  box  and  pre-incubated  for  30  min  at  room  temperature  in  a  50 
mM  Tris-HCl  (pH  7.4)  solution  containing  120  mM  NaCI,  5  mM  KCI,  2mM  CaCl, 
and  2mM  MgCIg.  Sections  were  then  incubated  at  room  temperature  for  60  min 
using  the  above  solution  to  which  0.1  nM  [^^^l]SCH  23982  had  been  added. 
Additionally,  a  concentration  of  50  nM  mianserine  (RBI,  Natick,  MA)  was  added 
to  the  incubation  solution  in  order  to  block  binding  to  5-HT  receptors. 


59 


Nonspecific  binding  was  determined  in  the  presence  of  IpM  of  the  selective  D1 
agonist  {“cold")  SCH  23990.  incubation  was  terminated  with  three  5-minute 
washes  of  ice-cold  50  mM  Tris.  Sections  were  then  dipped  in  ice-cold  distilled 
water  before  being  dried.  Sections  from  each  drug  group  were  assembled  and 
apposed  to  Hyperfilm-3H  (Amersham,  Sweden)  in  an  X-Ray  film  cartridge  for  4 
days.  Standards  of  known  radioactivity  were  prepared  and  placed  on  a  slide 
with  each  film.  After  exposure  films  were  developed  by  hand  using  Kodak-GBX 
developer  and  fixer  {Kodak,  Rochester,  NY).  Optical  density  of  autoradiograms 
{see  Figure  30)  was  determined  using  proprietary  software  designed  for  this 
purpose  {Tommerdahl  et  al.,  1985).  Optical  density  per  area  of  cortex  examined 
(mm^)  were  analyzed  using  analyses  of  variance. 

Statistical  Analyses 

Behavioral  data  were  analyzed  using  repeated-measures  multiple 
analyses  of  variance  {MANOVA)  with  time  as  the  within-subject  factor  and  drug 
condition  and  sex  as  the  between -subjects  factor.  Univariate  analyses  of 
variance  (ANOVA)  were  used  at  each  time  point  on  the  behavioral  tests  and  on 
receptor  density  data  to  determine  which  drug  groups  differed  significantly. 
Multiple  regression  correlation  analyses  (MRC)  were  used  to  determine  if  drug 
condition  significantly  predicted  subsequent  behavior  or  receptor  binding  (Cohen 
et  al.,  1 983).  Because  some  hypothesized  effects  were  non-linear,  a  priori 
planned  comparisons  were  performed  between  all  groups  as  necessary  (Hays, 
1994,  pp.  421-471).  Post  hoc  analyses  (Tukey-HSD  or  Dunnett’s  0  were  used 
when  significance  was  revealed  to  determine  which  groups  differed  significantly 


60 


{Hays,  1994,  p.  462;  Winer,  1962,  pp.  201-203).  Because  passive  avoidance 
performance  data  were  non-parametric,  they  were  analyzed  using  the  Chi- 
Square  test  for  /f  independent  samples  (Siegel  et  al.,  1988,  p.  191).  All  tests 
were  two-tailed  and  conducted  with  an  a-level  <  0.05. 


Results 


Body  Weight 

Figure  12  presents  mean  maternal  body  weight  data.  Dams  that  had 
received  nicotine  weighed  less  that  those  that  did  not.  Repeated-measures 
analyses  of  variance  (ANOVA)  on  maternal  body  weight  from  gestational  day  3 
{GD  3)  through  GD  22  (day  of  parturition)  revealed  that  body  weight  increased 
over  Time  [F{1,12)=238.017,  p<.001],  that  animals  receiving  drug  had  body 
weights  that  differed  from  control  animals  [F(2,12)=4.473,  p<.05],  and  revealed 
a  significant  Time  X  Drug  interaction  [F(2,12)=8.184,  p<.01]:  that  is,  animals  that 
had  received  drug  gained  weight  at  a  different  rate  over  time  than  those  that  did 
not  receive  drug.  Univariate  analyses  of  variance  performed  on  maternal  body

weight  at  each  day  revealed  a  main  effect  for  drug  on  all  days  beginning  on 
GD1 1  (see  Table  3  for  F  values)  through  post  natal  day  6  (PND  6).  Tukey  HSD 
post  hoc  analyses  revealed  that  the  dams  receiving  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine 
weighed  less  than  saline  controls  on  all  days  on  which  the  overall  analysis 
detected  significant  differences.  Those  dams  receiving  12  mg/kg/day  nicotine 
weighed  less  than  all  other  dams  (see  Figure  12).  After  parturition,  on  PND  2 
and  PND  6  dams  receiving  12  mg/kg/day  nicotine  weighed  significantly  less  than 
dams  receiving  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine  and  controls.  On  PND  2  dams  receiving  6 
mg/kg/day  nicotine  weighed  significantly  less  than  saline  controls. 

Figure  13  presents  mean  offspring  body  weight.  Because  males  gain 
weight  at  a  different  rate  than  females,  all  analyses  were  performed  separately 
for  each  sex.  Repeated-measures  ANOVA  on  male  offspring  body  weight  from

PND  2  through  PND  69  revealed  a  significant  main  effect  for  Time  (animals 
gained  weight  over  time)  [F(1 ,37) =9669.766,  p<.001]  and  a  main  effect  for  Drug 
(offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  drug  weighed  differently  than  those  that  had 
not  been  exposed  to  drug)  [F(2, 37) =5.246,  )o<.01].  Repeated-measures 
ANOVA  on  female  offspring  body  weight  from  PND  2  through  PND  69  revealed  a 
significant  main  effect  for  Time  [F(t,39)=4271.253,  /x.OOl]  and  a  main  effect  for 
Drug  [F(2,39)=5.049,  p<.05].  Univariate  ANOVAs  on  male  offspring  body  weight 
revealed  significant  main  effects  for  Drug  on;  PND  2-35;  PND  44-58;  and  PND 
65-67  (see  Table  4  for  F  values).  Days  on  which  significance  was  not  revealed 
were  days  during  which  food  was  restricted  as  described  above  in  the  Methods 
section  for  Radial-Arm  Maze.  At  all  time  points  where  significance  was  revealed, 
the  offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  12  mg/kg/day  nicotine  weighed  less  than 
the  other  groups  (see  Table  4  for  exact  comparisons).  Univariate  ANOVAs  on 
female  offspring  body  weight  revealed  significant  main  effects  for  Drug  on;  PND 
2-48;  PND  57,  65,  and  67  (see  Table  5  for  F  values).  Again,  at  all  time  points 
where  significance  was  revealed,  the  12  offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  12 
mg/kg/day  nicotine  weighed  less  than  the  other  groups  (see  Table  5  for  exact 
comparisons). 

RadiahArm  Maze 

Repeated-measures  multivariate  analyses  of  variance  (MANOVA) 
revealed  a  main  effect  for  Sex  on  radial-arm  maze  performance 
[F[1 ,74)=1 1 .271 ,  fK.OOl].  Therefore,  all  data  from  radial-arm  maze  were 
analyzed  separately  for  each  sex. 


64 


Figure  14  presents  entry  to  repeat  data  from  the  radial-arm  maze  for 
males.  No  significant  differences  were  revealed  during  adolescent  testing  (PND 
42-44)  other  than  a  main  effect  for  Time  [F(  1,37)  =7. 076,  p<.02]  indicating  that  all 
animals  improved  performance  over  time.  Repeated  measures  ANOVA  on  adult 
performance  (PND  62-65)  revealed  a  significant  main  effect  for  Time 
[F{^  ,37)=1 8.663,  p<.001]  and  a  main  effect  for  Drug  [F(2,37)=23.408,  pK.OI]. 
Univariate  ANOVAs  at  each  time  point  revealed  a  trend  on  PND  62  for  Drug 
[F(2,37)=.088,  p=.058]  and  a  significant  main  effect  for  drug  on  PND  63 
[F(2,37)=3.289,  p<.05]  and  PND  64  [H2,37)=4.393,  p<.05].  Dunnett’s  t  post 
hoc  analyses  revealed  that  the  offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  12  mg/kg/day

nicotine  made  significantly  fewer  correct  choices  than  the  control  group  in  PND 
62,  63,  and  64. 

Figure  1 5  presents  entry  to  repeat  data  for  female  offspring.  There  were 
no  significant  effects  during  adolescent  testing.  Repeated-measures  ANOVA  on 
adult  performance  data  revealed  a  main  effect  for  Time  [F(1,39)=14.179,  p<.001] 
and  a  Time  X  Drug  interaction  [F{2,39)=3.602,  fx.Od],  that  is,  animals  that  had 
been  exposed  to  drug  showed  different  rates  of  improvement  overtime  than 
those  animals  that  had  not  been  exposed  to  drug.  Individual  ANOVAs 
performed  on  each  adult  testing  day  revealed  no  significant  drug  effects.

Univariate  ANOVAs  revealed  that  females  differed  significantly  on  PND  42 
(H2,38)=5.143,  p<.05],  where  the  offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  12

experiment  progressed  during  adolescent  testing,  [F(1 ,37)=92.653,  p<.001]. 
During  adult  testing  (PND  62-65),  there  was  a  significant  main  effect  for  Time

Water  Maze 

Repeated-measures  MANOVA  for  latency  to  find  the  unmarked  platform 
in  water  maze  revealed  a  main  effect  for  Time  [/=(1,72)=24.240,  p<.001]  and  a 
significant  Time  X  Sex  X  Drug  interaction  [F(1,72)=3.173,  p<.05].  That  is,  over 
time  male  and  female  animals  responded  to  the  drug  differently.  In  order  to 
examine  individual  components  of  this  interaction,  the  sexes  were  analyzed 
separately.

significantly  longer  to  find  the  platform  than  either  the  saline  control  group  or  the 
offspring  exposed  to  12  mg/kg/day  nicotine.  Univariate  ANOVA  revealed  a  main

Passive  Avoidance 

Data  for  Passive  Avoidance  were  recoded  into  a  binary  format:  "yes",  the 
animal  successfully  performed  the  PA  task  —  it  did  not  cross  into  the  dark  side; 
or  “no",  the  animal  did  not  successfully  perform  the  task  —  it  did  cross.  Table  6 
presents  chi-square  analyses  of  the  passive  avoidance  data.  The  analyses 
revealed  that  a  significantly  larger  proportion  of  the  male  offspring  that  had  been 
exposed  to  6  mg/kg/day  and  to  12  mg/kg/day  nicotine  performed  the  task 
correctly.  All  other  groups  were  equally  distributed  between  the  two  criteria. 
Additionally,  when  the  non-transformed  latency  data  were  analyzed  {see  Figure 
22)  by  the  Kruskal-Wallis  test  (a  non-parametric  ANOVA  equivalent)  a  significant 
overall  main  effect  for  Sex  (x^  =8.273  df=^ ,  p<.01]  and  for  Drug  [/=6.550,  clf=2, 
p<.05]  were  revealed.  When  the  sexes  were  analyzed  separately,  a  main  effect 
for  drug  was  revealed  in  mates  only  [x^  =7.464,  df=2,  p<.05. 


Passive  avoidance  latency  data

Multiple  regression  correlation  (MRC)  analyses  were  performed  to 
ascertain  the  amount  of  variance  of  passive  avoidance  performance  that  was 
accounted  for  by  sex,  drug,  and  locomotor  activity  (used  as  a  predictor 
variables).  This  was  done  in  order  to  determine  to  what  extent  each  predictor 
variable  contributed  to  passive  avoidance  performance.  A  step-wise, 
hierarchical  MRC  was  performed  in  which  each  predictor  variable  was  entered  in 
order  (sex,  drug,  locomotor).  Sex  and  prenatal  drug  exposure  accounted  for  a 
significant  proportion  of  the  variance  of  passive  avoidance  performance, 
[F(2,79)=4.692,  /x.OS  R®=.106].  However,  when  locomotor  activity  was 
entered,  it  did  not  contribute  significantly  to  the  proportion  of  the  variance  of 
passive  avoidance  performance.  The  overall  R^  increased  only  to  R®=.107, 
which  was  not  a  significant  contribution  to  the  overall  variance,  t(78)=.248, 
p=.805.  This  finding  indicates  that  passive  avoidance  perfonmance  could  not  be 
explained  by  the  each  animat's  locomotor  activity. 

ASR-PPI 

Figure  23  presents  amount  of  startle  amplitude  to  the  122  dB  stimulus 
when  presented  with  a  pre-pulse  on  PND  67.  Univariate  ANOVA  revealed  a 
significant  main  effect  for  Sex  [F(1,76)=1 3.285,  /x.001]  and  Drug 
[F(2,76)=6.317,  p<,001].  When  the  sexes  were  analyzed  separately,  a 
significant  main  effect  for  Drug  was  revealed  in  females  only  [f(2,39)=4.646,

been  exposed  to  12  mg/kg/day  nicotine  startled  significantly  more  than  the  other 
offspring.

Locomotion 

All  analyses  for  locomotor  activity  were  conducted  separately  for  each  sex 
because  females  tend  to  move  different  amounts  than  males  (Faraday  et  al., 
1998b).  All  significant  differences  were  revealed  during  adolescent  testing  (PND 
46).  These  differences  were  not  found  during  adult  testing  (PND  60).  Figure  25 
presents  number  of  movements  data,  that  is,  the  number  of  discrete  movements

both  dosages  of  drug  made  significantly  fewer  movements  than  control  offspring, 
[F(2,39)=4.276.  p<.05].

Discussion 


The  purpose  of  the  present  experiment  was  to  examine  effects  of  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine  on  spatial  and  non-spatial  memory,  activity,  sensory  gating 
and  reactivity,  and  dopamine  D1  receptor  binding  in  adolescent  and  adult  male 
and  female  rats.  Prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  resulted  in  cognitive  and 
behavioral  effects  in  the  offspring.  Some  of  these  changes  appeared  in 
adolescence,  some  appeared  in  adulthood,  and  some  that  had  appeared  in 
adolescence  disappeared  by  adulthood.  In  addition,  there  were  sex  differences 
in  these  effects.  In  general,  offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  nicotine  in  utero 
showed  altered:  body  weight,  memory  performance,  reactivity  to  an  acoustic 
stimulus,  sensory  gating  abilities,  and  aotivity  levels.  There  were,  however,  no 
discernible  changes  in  D1  receptor  binding  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex. 

Based  on  these  findings,  some  of  the  hypotheses  were  accepted  and  others 
were  rejected.  Table  7  presents  a  listing  of  the  acceptance  and  rejection  of 
specific  hypotheses.  More  specifically,  Table  8  presents  a  summary  of  all  of  the 
findings  broken  down  by  dependent  variable,  sex  and  age  of  testing  of  the 
subjects.  Each  of  the  findings  summarized  in  Table  8  is  discussed  below 
followed  by  a  discussion  of  how  these  findings  relate  to  other  reports,  the 
implications  of  the  present  findings  for  prenatal  tobacco  effects  in  humans,  and 
possible  future  directions  for  research.

Body  Weight 

Nicotine  reduced  body  weight  of  dams  and  offspring,  as  hypothesized  and 
consistent  with  previous  reports.  Dams  that  had  received  nicotine  lost  weight  in 
a  dose-response  manner.  Those  animals  that  received  1 2  mg/kg/day  nicotine 
weighed  less  than  those  that  received  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine  and  they,  in  turn, 
weighed  less  than  those  that  had  received  saline.  This  finding  confirms  previous 
reports  that  nicotine  reduces  body  weight  in  a  dose-response  manner  (Grunberg 
et  al.,  1984;  Grunberg  et  al.,  1986;  Morgan  et  al.,  1987;  Saah  et  al.,  1994; 
Winders  et  al.,  1993)  and  serves  to  confirm  that  nicotine  was  effectively 
administered  in  the  present  experiment. 

Additionally,  as  hypothesized,  offspring  of  dams  that  had  received  nicotine 
during  pregnancy  weighed  less  than  those  that  did  not  receive  nicotine.  This 
result  confirms  previous  findings  with  animals  (e.g.,  Cutler  et  al.,  1996;  Levin  et 
al.,  1998)  and  humans  {e.g.,  Aronson  et  al.,  1993;  Brooke  et  al.,  1989;  Peacock 
et  al.,  1991).  The  effect  of  nicotine  to  reduce  body  weight  occurred  in  male  and 
female  subjects  and  persisted  throughout  adolescence  and  into  adulthood. 

Memory  Performance 

Spatial  Working  Memory 

Overall,  prenatal  administration  of  nicotine  resulted  in  either  impaired 
spatial  working  memory  performance  or  no  effect.  The  specific  results 
depended  on  the  specific  task  (i.e.,  radial-arm  maze  versus  water  maze),  age  of 
subjects,  and  sex  of  subjects. 


82 


Radial-Arm  Maze 

While  all  animals  showed  evidence  of  ability  to  learn  the  maze  overtime, 
offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  nicotine  took  longer  to  attain  performance 
levels  indistinguishable  from  controls.  Additionally,  memory  performance  was 
impaired  as  a  result  of  nicotine  administration  in  utero.  However,  each  sex  was 
affected  differently.  Adult  male  offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  nicotine 
made  fewer  correct  choices  in  the  radial-arm  maze  before  an  error  was  made 
and  took  longer  to  complete  the  task.  Adolescent  females  that  had  been 
exposed  to  nicotine  made  more  errors  than  control  females,  but  this  effect  was 
not  found  in  adults.  These  findings  partially  confirm  the  hypothesis  that  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine  will  globally  impair  radial-arm  maze  performance.  The 
results  are  complex  and  indicate  that  time  of  testing  and  sex  of  subject  are 
extremely  important. 

The  present  findings  are  at  odds  with  the  conclusion  of  Levin  and 
colleagues  (1996;  1993b:  1996b)  that  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  resulted  in 
no  effects  on  radial-arm  maze  performance  but  confirmed  the  findings  of  Yanai 
and  colleagues  (1992)  who  reported  deleterious  effects  in  mice.  Taken  together, 
these  findings  indicate  that  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  does  affect  radial-arm 
maze  performance  and  previous  null  findings  may  be  explained  by  too  low  a 
dosage  of  nicotine. 

Water  Maze 

The  results  of  water  maze  performance  also  depended  on  nicotine 
exposure,  age,  and  sex  of  the  subjects.  Adolescent  males  that  had  been 


83 


exposed  to  nicotine  tended  to  take  longer  to  find  the  hidden,  un-marked  platform, 
but  this  effect  disappeared  by  adulthood  and  there  were  no  differences  found  for 
females  of  either  age  group.  This  effect  was  seen  robustly  only  on  one  day  of 
the  experiment.  The  reason  for  this  change  in  performance  on  one  day  of 
testing,  in  only  one  group  of  animals  is  not  known.  All  of  the  behavioral 
measures  were  run  in  a  counter  balanced  fashion.  That  is,  all  possible  groups 
were  represented  in  each  ‘Tun"  of  a  test  and  multiple  runs  were  performed 
throughout  the  day  until  all  animals  had  been  tested.  The  order  of  animals  was 
changed  randomly  each  day.  Therefore,  on  PND  53  the  at  least  two  male 
offspring  that  had  been  exposed  to  6  mg/kg/day  nicotine  were  tested  in  each  run 
of  the  water  maze  task  throughout  the  day.  Perhaps  on  this  day,  these  particular 
males  experienced  a  change  in  adolescent  hormone  levels  on  this  day,  and  the 
other  males  did  not. 

These  findings  disagree  with  the  report  by  Cutler  and  colleagues  (1 996) 
that  prenatal  nicotine  exposure  does  not  affect  water  maze  performance.  As 
with  the  radial-arm  maze  findings,  the  difference  between  the  present  findings 
and  Cutler  and  colleagues  is  likely  a  result  of  the  fact  that  Cutler  used  a  dosage 
of  nicotine  that  was  too  low  (4  mg/kg/day). 

The  water  maze  results  of  the  present  experiment,  taken  with  radial-arm 
maze  results,  suggest  that  human  males  exposed  to  cigarette  smoke  in  utero 
may  have  deficits  in  spatial  memory  processing  that  do  not  appear  until 
adulthood,  whereas  females  that  had  been  exposed  to  cigarette  smoke  may 
have  deficits  that  peak  in  adolescence  and  disappear  by  adulthood. 


84 

Non’Spatial  Memory 

Passive  Avoidance 

Unexpectedly,  passive  avoidance  performance  was  improved  in  males 
and  there  was  no  effect  in  females,  counter  to  the  hypothesized  effect.  Previous 
reports  examining  avoidance  conditioning  reported  mostly  null  findings  of 
prenatal  nicotine  (Bertolini  et  al.,  1982;  Genedani  et  al.,  1983;  Peters  et  al., 

1982)  but,  as  with  previous  studies  examining  prenatal  nicotine  exposure  and 
spatial  working  memory,  the  dosages  used  by  other  investigators,  likely,  were 
too  low  (0.5-3. 0  mg/kg). 

The  improvement  in  performance  found  in  the  present  experiment  was 
not  associated  with  nor  could  it  be  explained  by  changes  in  locomotor  activity 
(see  Locomotor  Activity  belov\^.  This  finding  is  particularly  interesting  because  it 
demonstrates  a  disconnect  between  effects  of  nicotine  on  spatial  working 
memory  performance  (mazes)  and  non-spatial  memory  (passive  avoidance), 
and  an  actual  reversal  in  the  direction  of  the  effects  between  these  two  types  of 
memory  performance.  Additionally,  these  findings,  like  those  for  spatial  working 
memory,  demonstrate  a  differential  response  to  prenatal  drug  exposure  between 
the  sexes.  Males  exposed  to  nicotine  in  utero  were  better  able  to  inhibit  a 
natural  inclination  to  move  away  from  a  lit  area  into  a  dark  area,  whereas 
females  and  non-drug-exposed  males  were  equally  likely  to  cross  or  not  cross 
into  the  dark  area.  This  finding  is  particularly  interesting  given  the  animals’ 
locomotor  activity. 


85 


Locomotor  Activity 

There  were  two  major  reasons  for  examining  locomotor  activity:  1)  as  an 
index  of  overall  activity,  and  2)  as  a  behaviorai  control  for  passive  avoidance 
performance.  Briefly,  because  passive  avoidance  performance  is  motor-activity 
dependent,  it  is  important  to  measure  and  consider  any  changes  in  general 
motor  activity. 

Adolescent  females  tended  to  decrease  locomotor  activity  in  a  linear 
fashion  with  increased  dosage  of  prenatai  drug  exposure,  counter  to  hypothesis 
and  previous  reports  in  rats  (Richardson  et  al.,  1994;  Tizabi  et  al.,  1997)  and 
humans  (Denson  et  al.,  1975;  Naeye,  1992).  Adolescent  males  showed  an 
inverted  U-shaped  dose  response,  that  is,  males  prenatally  exposed  to  the  low 
dose  of  nicotine  tended  to  exhibit  higher  levels  of  exploratory  locomotor  activity 
(e.g.,  vertical  activity,  time  spent  vertical  (Decker.  1995))  as  compared  to 
controls  and  the  higher  dose,  partially  confirming  the  hypothesis  that  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine  would  increase  activity  of  both  sexes. 

If  the  passive  avoidance  performance  had  been  governed  by  motor 
activity  alone,  then  females  should  have  performed  better  on  passive  avoidance 
and  should  not  have  crossed  to  the  dark  chamber.  Similarly,  males  exposed  to  6 
mg/kg/day  nicotine,  should  have  moved  more  quickly  to  the  dark  chamber 
because  they  exhibited  higher  levels  of  exploratory  behavior  than  controls  or  the 
12  mg/kg/day  group.  Because  the  passive  avoidance  performance  was 
inconsistent  with  the  locomotor  findings,  it  must  be  concluded  that  prenatal 
nicotine  exposure  somehow  improved  males  ability  to  remember  not  to  cross 


86 

into  the  dark  chamber  and  had  no  effect  on  females.  Again,  these  findings 
indicate  that  sex  of  subject  is  extremely  important  in  testing  cognitive 
performance. 

Acoustic  Startle  and  Pre-Pulse  Inhibition 

The  findings  indicated  that  prenatal  nicotine  exposure  had  no  effect  on 
acoustic  startle  and  pre-pulse  inhibition  during  adolescence,  and  had  an 
unexpected  gender-specific  effect  during  adulthood. 

Female  offspring  that  had  been  prenatally  exposed  to  nicotine  had 
increased  reactivity  (in  a  linear  fashion  with  increasing  dosage)  to  the  122  dB 
stimulus  when  presented  with  a  pre-pulse  when  tested  in  adulthood.  This  finding 
is  particularly  striking  because  no  other  effects  were  found  in  reactivity  to  an 
acoustic  stimulus  prior  to  PND  67.  In  contrast,  male  offspring  that  had  been 
exposed  to  nicotine  prenatally  showed  no  effect. 

Aa'attfanati'y,  aoUrt' mafes  rrtaf  hao' been  exposed  to  the  (ow  dose  of 
nicotine  showed  a  decrement  in  ability  to  inhibit  their  reaction  to  a  startling 
acoustic  stimulus,  in  other  words,  an  inability  to  gate  sensory  information, 
whereas  adult  females  showed  an  enhanced  ability  to  inhibit  their  responses. 
Again,  similar  to  the  findings  for  acoustic  startle  reactivity,  the  effects  of  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine  did  not  appear  until  adulthood,  and  these  effects  were  not 
only  different  for  each  sex,  but  were  opposite  in  their  direction.  These  findings 
suggest  that  while  attention  deficit  disorder,  with  and  without  hyperactivity  (ADD 
and  ADHD,  respectively),  may  be  associated  with  maternal  smoking  in  human 
children  (Denson  et  al.,  1975;  Kristjansson  et  al.,  1989;  Naeye,  1992;  Picone  et 


87 


al.,  1982;  Streissguth,  1984),  ability  to  gate  or  inhibit  reactions  to  startling  stimuli 
may  be  impaired  in  adult  males,  a  defect  that  may  not  show  up  until  adulthood. 
This  finding  may  help  to  explain  recent  reports  that  adults  are  increasingly 
reporting  symptoms  similar  to  ADD  and  ADHD  (e.g.,  Beliak  et  al.,  1992;  Dalteg  et 
al,,  1998;  Shaffer,  1994).  Additionally,  if  nicotine  administration  through  cigarette 
smoking  during  gestation  causes  these  deficits,  then  nicotine  administration  in 
adults  may  ameliorate  or  improve  attentional  processing  (Bates  et  aL,  1995; 
Kassel,  1997a;  Kassel  et  al.,  1997b;  Spilich  et  al.,  1992). 

D1  Autoradiography 

It  was  hypothesized  that  prenatal  nicotine  administration  would  affect 
dopamine  receptor  numbers  as  previously  reported  {Fung  et  al,,  1989;  e.g., 

Fung  et  al.,  1992;  Levin  et  al.,  1998;  Navarro  et  al.,  1988).  It  was  further 
hypothesized  that  changes  would  be  evident  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex 
because  of  its  role  in  memory  processing  (e.g.,  de  Bruin  et  al.,  1994;  Goldman- 
Rakic,  1990)  and  that  changes  in  this  area  would  be  associated  with  changes  in 
memory  processing.  Increased  optical  density  indicating  presence  of  dopamine 
receptors  was  found  in  a  pattern  that  is  in  agreement  with  previous  findings 
examining  the  amount  of  dopamine  released  in  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  as  a 
result  of  electrical  stimulation  (Garris  et  al.,  1993).  That  is,  less  binding  at  the 
most  dorsal  and  ventral  locations  of  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex  and  most 
located  in  the  area  in  between  (see  Figure  30,  circle  ‘a)  indicating  that  the 
correct  area  was  examined.  However,  there  were  no  differences  in  optical 
density  of  this  area  between  groups  of  offspring,  even  though  changes  in 


88 


memory  processing  were  found  as  a  result  of  nicotine  administration.  Possible 
explanations  for  this  null  finding  could  be:  1)  the  dopaminergic  system  adapted 
to  alterations  as  a  result  of  nicotine  administration  (neural  plasticity);  2) 
dopamine  alone  does  not  account  for  memory  processing  (e.g.,  the  cholinergic 
system  also  plays  a  role  in  memory  processing  (Broersen  et  a!.,  1995));  3)  the 
area  analyzed  in  rats  is  not  the  area  responsible  for  memory  processing  despite 
the  reports  of  previous  studies  in  rats  (e.g.,  Aggleton  et  al.,  1995;  Broersen  et 
al.,  1995;  Bubser  et  al.,  1994;  de  Bruin  et  al.,  1994)  and  primates  (e.g., 
Goldman-Rakic,  1992;  Sawaguchi  et  al.,  1991;  Williams  et  at.,  1995));  4) 
changes  in  spatial  memory  performance  may  have  been  a  result  of  alterations  in 
other  areas  previously  shown  to  play  a  strong  role  in  these  behaviors  (e.g.,  the 
hippocampus  (e.g.,  Olton  et  al.,  1979a;  Olton  et  al.,  1977)). 

Summary  and  Future  Directions 

Taken  together,  the  findings  from  this  experiment  indicate  that  prenatal 
exposure  to  nicotine  results  in  behavioral  and  cognitive  effects  that  are:  1 ) 
different  for  each  sex,  2)  dependent  on  age  of  testing,  3)  not  always  an 
impairment  in  performance,  4)  not  associated  with  changes  in  D1  binding  in  the 
medial  prefrontal  cortex  in  rats.  In  light  of  these  considerations,  there  are 
several  possible  future  studies  that  should  be  completed  to  address  each 
consideration. 

First,  it  is  important  to  determine  why  there  are  sex  differences  in 
behavioral  responses  to  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine.  One  possibility  is  that  the 
differences  that  were  observed  were  a  result  of  differences  in  sensitivity  to 


89 


nicotine.  That  is,  females  and  males  may  have  similar  responses  to  nicotine’s 
effects  but  be  differentially  sensitive  to  particular  dosages  of  this  drug.  If  this  is 
the  case,  then  the  differences  that  were  observed  reflected  a  shift  in  an 
underlying  dose-effect  curve.  Alternatively,  males  and  females  may  respond 
differently  to  nicotine.  In  locomotor  activity,  for  example,  females  exhibited  a 
decreasing  linear  dose  response  to  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine,  whereas 
males  exhibited  an  inverse  U-shaped  dose  response.  Are  the  females  shifted  to 
the  left  in  the  dose-response  spectrum  (an  increase  in  sensitivity)  and  only  the 
decreasing  limb  of  the  inverted  U-shaped  dose  response  curve  is  seen,  or  is 
there  a  different  function  that  underlies  female  and  male  responses  to  prenatal 
nicotine  exposure?  One  way  to  investigate  these  possibilities  is  to  repeat  this 
experiment  using  a  larger  number  of  dosages  (e.g.,  3.0,  6.0,  9.0,  and  12.0 
mg/kg/day)  in  order  to  cover  a  larger  portion  of  the  dose-response  spectrum  to 
identify  the  entire  curve. 

Another  possible  explanation  for  this  sex  difference  may  be 
neuroanatomical  differences  in  response  to  gonadal  hormones.  Kolb  and 
colleagues  {1990a)  have  identified  structural  differences  between  the  sexes  in 
prefrontal  cortex  neurons.  Specifically,  there  are  differences  in  the  global 
structure  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  between  the  sexes,  and  male  rats  show  greater 
amounts  of  dendritic  arborization.  Grafts  from  female  rats  placed  into  males 
showed  similar  effects  and  these  effects  were  blocked  by  neonatal  castration 
(Stewart  et  al.,  1988).  Additionally,  in  behavioral  studies  conducted  by  Kolb 
(1987;  1988)  lesions  of  the  medial  frontal  region  produced  larger  deficits  in 


90 

females  on  water  maze  and  a  variant  of  the  radial-arm  maze.  To  follow  up  on 
this  possible  explanation  for  the  sex  differences  in  the  present  experiment, 
offspring  could  be  gonadectomized  and  sex  hormones  could  be  manipulated. 

Because  of  the  differences  in  the  findings  between  spatial  memory  tasks 
and  the  non-spatial  task,  future  experiment  should  examine  effects  of  prenatal 
nicotine  exposure  on  other  types  of  cognitive  tasks  such  as:  active  avoidance, 
freezing,  16-arm  radial-arm  maze,  other  radial-arm  maze  procedures  (e.g., 
restricting  access  in  the  hub  of  the  maze),  and  other  water  maze  procedures 
(e.g.,  underwater  swim  maze).  The  addition  of  these  measures  would  broaden 
the  investigation  to  the  study  of  several  different  types  of  memory,  more 
complicated  and  demanding  memory  tasks,  and  measures  of  learning.  Perhaps 
this  inclusion  would  reveal  additional  effects  of  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine  on 
cognitive  performance. 

Another  possible  future  study  should  examine  each  of  the  variables  tested 
in  this  experiment,  but  starting  at  an  older  age.  Changing  the  age  of  testing 
would  establish  if  the  effects  truly  disappear  at  adulthood,  as  in  the  case  of  water 
maze  performance,  or  if  they  disappear  because  of  learning  effects.  If  the  effect 
truly  disappears  by  adulthood  (or  conversely,  appears  only  during  adulthood  as 
found  in  this  experiment  for  radial-arm  maze  performance),  then  it  can  be 
established  that  many  effects  of  prenatal  exposure  are  either  long-lasting  or 
require  long  periods  of  time  to  become  evident.  Because  these  variables  are 
affected  by  nicotine  administration  during  gestation,  could  administration  of 
various  dosages  of  nicotine  in  adulthood  ameliorate  the  deficits  found?  To 


91 


answer  this  question,  rats  exposed  to  nicotine  prenatally  would  be  administered 
various  dosages  of  nicotine  or  saline  and  tested  throughout  the  life  span. 

The  findings  of  the  present  research  also  may  have  implications  for 
humans.  It  is  particularly  important  to  confirm  that  nicotine  administration  during 
gestation  can  cause  long-term  effects  on  offspring,  and  whether  some  of  these 
effects  may  not  appear  until  adulthood.  Epidemiologic  studies  examining  the 
effects  of  cigarette  smoking  in  humans  should  examine  adults  who  were  children 
of  smoking  mothers  to  determine  if  there  are  untoward  effects  that  either  persist 
until  adulthood,  as  Fogelman  and  Manor  (1988)  reported  with  intellectual 
achievement,  or  do  not  appear  until  adulthood.  Such  studies  might  be 
conducted  in  populations  where  cigarette  smoking  prevalence  remains  high 
{e.g.,  in  low  socioeconomic  status  communities  in  the  United  States,  throughout 
Europe,  and  in  Asia).  Additionally,  other  cognitive  variables  (e.g.,  attention  and 
specific  types  of  memory)  should  be  examined  in  adult  humans.  If  nicotine 
administration  via  cigarette  smoking  during  pregnancy  causes  deleterious  effects 
in  the  offspring,  then  administration  of  nicotinic  cholinergic  agonists  may  help  to 
ameliorate  these  deficits.  If  administration  of  nicotinic  agonists  does  help  to 
alleviate  deficits  induced  by  smoking  during  pregnancy,  then  that  may  explain 
why  some  people  initiate  smoking  behavior;  they  are  self-medicating  themselves 
by  self-administering  nicotine.  This  finding  may  lead  to  alternate  explanations  for 
smoking  behavior  that  may  lead  to  additional  treatment  strategies  for  smoking 
cessation. 

In  summary,  the  present  research  examined  prenatal  exposure  to  nicotine 


92 


and  found  that  cognitive  performance  was  affected  with  most  measures  showing 
impairment  but  a  few  revealing  improvement.  There  were  sex  differences  in 
these  responses  and  some  effects  were  not  revealed  until  adulthood.  Future 
research  should  further  examine  these  sex  differences,  in  addition,  it  is 
important  to  examine  possible,  underlying  mechanisms  including  the  potential 
involvement  of  specific  neurotransmitter  systems  (e.g.,  cholinergic)  and  specific 
neuroanatomic  (e.g.,  hippocampus)  involvement.
