transportation  facilities,  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase  such  production  at  the  wellhead  market  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such 
price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  for  production  of  similar  grade  and  gravity;  (b)  for  gas  (including  casinghead  gas) 
and  all  other  substances  covered  hereby,  the  royalty  shall  be  25%  of  the  proceeds  realized  by  Lessee  from  the  sale  thereof,  less  a  proportionate  part  of  ad  valorem  taxes  and  production,

well  or  wells  shall  nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying  quantities  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  this  lease.  If  for  a  period  of  90  consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut-in 
or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall  pay  shut-in  royalty  of  one  dollar  per  acre  then  covered  by  this  lease,  such  payment  to  be  made  to  Lessor  or  to  Lessor's

consecutive  days  and  if  any  such  operations  result  in  the  production  of  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby,  as  long  thereafter  as  there  is  production  in  paying 
quantities  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  After  completion  of  a  well  capable  of  producing  In  paying  quantities  hereunder,  Lessee  shall  drill  such 
additional  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  as  a  reasonably  prudent  operatorwould  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances  to  (a)  develop  the 
leased  premises  as  to  formations  then  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  (b)  to  protect  the  leased  premises 
from  uncompensated  drainage  by  any  well  orwells  located  on  other  lands  not  pooled  therewith.  Tnereshall  be  no  covenantto  drill  exploratory  wells  orany  additional  wells

or  all  depths  or  zones,  and  as  to  any  or  all  substances  covered  by  this  lease,  either  before  orafterthe  commencement  of  production,  whenever  Lessee  deems  it  necessary 
or  proper  to  do  so  in  orderto  prudently  develop  oroperate  the  leased  premises,  whether  or  not  similar  pooling  authority  exists  with  respect  to  such  other  lands  or  interests.

well  or  a  horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  640  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  1 0%;  provided  that  a  larger  unit  may  be  formed  for  an  oil  well  or  gas  well 
or  horizontal  completion  to  conform  to  any  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  that  may  be  prescribed  or  permitted  by  any  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  lo  do  so. 
For  the  purpose  of  the  foregoing,  the  terms  "oil  well"  and  "gas  well"  shall  have  the  meanings  prescribed  by  applicable  lawor  the  appropriate  governmental  authority,  or,  if 
no  definition  is  so  prescribed,  "oil  well'  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil  ratio  of  less  than  1 00,000  cubic  feet  per  barrel  and  "gas  well"  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil 
ratio  of  100,000  cubic  feet  or  more  per  barrel,  based  on  24-hour  production  test  conducted  under  normal  producing  conditions  using  standard  lease  separator  facilities  or 
equivalent  testing  equipment;  and  the  term  "horizontal  completion"  means  an  oil  well  in  which  the  horizontal  component  of  the  gross  completion  interval  in  facilities  or 
equivale.nl  testing  equipment;  and  the  term  "horizontal  completion'  means  an  oil  well  in  which  the  horizontal  component  of  the  gross  completion  interval  in  the  reservoir 
exceeds  the  vertical  component  thereof.  In  exercising  its  pooling  rights  hereunder.  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the 
effective  date  of  pooling.  Production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  anywhere  on  a  unit  which  includes  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  shall  be  treated  as  if  it  were 
production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  the  leased  premises,  except  that  the  production  on  which  Lessor's  royalty  is  calculated  shall  be  that  proportion  of  the  total 
unit  production  which  the  net  acreage  covered  by  this  lease  and  included  In  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  gross  acreage  in  the  unit,  but  only  lo  the  extent  such  proportion  of  unit

obligation  to  revise  any  unit  formed  hereunder  by  expansion  or  contraction  or  both,  either  before  or  after  commencement  of  production,  in  order  to  conform  to  the  well 
spacing  or  density  pattern  prescribed  or  permitted  by  the  governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction,  or  to  conform  to  any  productive  acreage  determination  made  by  such 
governmental  authority.  In  making  such  a  revision,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  revised  unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of  revision.  To 
the  extent  any  portion  of  the  leased  premises  is  included  in  or  excluded  from  the  unit  by  virtue  of  such  revision,  the  proportion  of  unit  production  on  which  royalties  are 
payable  hereunder  shall  thereafter  be  adjusted  accordingly.  In  the  absence  of  production  in  paying  quantities  from  a  uniL  or  upon  permanent  cessation  thereof,  Lessee 
may  terminate  the  unit  by  filing  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the  date  of  termination.  Pooling  hereunder  shall  not  constitute  a  cross- 
conveyance  of  interests. 

7  If  Lessor  owns  less  than  the  full  mineral  estate  in  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises,  the  royalties  and  shut-in  royalties  payable  hereunder  for  any  well  on 
any  part  of  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  shall  be  reduced  to  the  proportion  that  Lessor's  interest  in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises  bears  to  the  full 
mineral  estate  in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises. 

8  The  interest  of  either  Lessor  or  Lessee  hereunder  may  be  assigned,  devised  or  otheiwise  transfened  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  area  and/or  by  depth  or  zone, 
and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  hereunder  shall  extend  to  their  respective  heirs,  devisees,  executors,  administrators,  successors  and  assigns.  No  change  in 
Lessor's  ownership  shall  have  the  effect  of  reducing  the  rights  or  enlarging  the  obligations  of  Lessee  hereunder,  and  no  change  in  ownership  shall  be  binding  on  Lessee 
until  60  days  after  Lessee  has  been  furnished  the  original  or  certified  or  duly  authenticated  copies  of  the  documents  establishing  such  change  of  ownership  to  the 
satisfaction  of  Lessee  or  until  Lessor  has  satisfied  the  notification  requirements  contained  in  Lessee's  usual  form  of  division  order.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  any  person 
entitled  to  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  Lessee  may  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalties  to  the  credit  of  decedent  or  decedent's  estate  in  the  depository  designated  above.  If 
at  any  time  two  or  more  persons  are  entitled  to  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  Lessee  may  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalties  to  such  persons  or  to  their  credit  in  the 
depository,  either  jointly  or  separately  in  proportion  to  the  interest  which  each  owns.  If  Lessee  transfers  its  interest  hereunder  in  whole  or  in  part  Lessee  shall  be  relieved  of 
all  obligations  thereafter  arising  with  respect  to  the  transfened  interest,  and  failure  of  the  transferee  lo  satisfy  such  obligations  with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest  shall 


not  affect  the  rights  of  Lessee  with  respect  to  any  interest  not  so  transferred.  If  Lessee  transfers  a  full  or  undivided  interest  in  all  or  any  portion  of  the  area  covered  by  this 
lease,  the  obligation  to  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  hereunder  shall  be  divided  between  Lessee  and  the  transferee  in  proportion  to  the  net  acreage  interest  in  this  lease 
then  held  by  each. 

9.  Lessee  may,  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time,  deliver  to  Lessor  or  file  of  record  a  written  release  of  this  lease  as  to  a  full  or  undivided  interest  in  all  or  any 
portion  of  the  area  covered  by  this  lease  or  any  depths  orzones  thereunder,  and  shall  thereupon  be  relieved  of  all  obligations  thereafter  arising  with  respect  to  the  interest 
so  released,  tf  Lessee  releases  all  or  an  undivided  interest  in  less  than  all  of  the  area  covered  hereby.  Lessee's  obligation  to  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  shall  be 
proportionately  reduced  in  accordance  with  the  net  acreage  interest  retained  hereunder. 

10.  Lessee's  obligations  under  this  lease,  whether  express  or  implied,  shall  be  subject  to  all  applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations  and  orders  of  any 
governmental  authority  having  Jurisdiction,  including  restrictions  on  the  drilling  and  production  of  wells,  and  regulation  of  the  price  or  transportation  of  oil,  gas  and 
other  substances  covered  hereby.  Lessor  hereby  agrees  that,  in  the  event  Lessee  deems  it  necessary  to  seek  a  variance,  waiver  or  other  relief  from  any  laws,  rules, 
regulations,  or  orders  (which  for  purposes  of  this  paragraph  shall  include  any  ordinance)  or  other  such  authority  exercised  by  (i.)  the  City  of  Arlington,  including  but 
not  limited  to  the  well  setback  distance  for  gas  drilling  and  production,  or  (ii.)  by  any  other  governmental  entity  or  authority  having  jurisdiction,  then  Lessor  shall 
engage  in  reasonable  acts  and  execute  and  deliver  such  instruments  and  documents  Lessee  deems  necessary  or  convenient  in  seeking  such  relief.  In  the  event 
Lessee  is  required  by  such  authority  to  acquire  Lessor's  consent  as  a  prerequisite  to  obtain  such  variance,  waiver  or  other  relief,  Lessor  grants  to  Lessee  and  agrees 
that  Lessee's  leasehold  estate  acquired  hereunder  includes  the  right  to  utilize  this  lease  as  Lessor's  consent  and  ratification  of  any  subsequent  variance,  waiver  or 
other  relief  Lessee  seeks,  without  the  necessity  of  Lessee  obtaining  any  additional  or  subsequent  consentfs  from  Lessor.  Lessor  furthermore  agrees  not  to  execute 
documents  or  instruments  or  engage  in  acts  that  would  diminish  or  adversely  affect  the  relief  Lessee  is  seeking.

disputes,  or  by  inability  to  obtain  a  satisfactory  market  for  production  or  failure  of  purchasers  or  carriers  to  take  or  transport  such  production,  or  by  any  other  cause  not 
reasonably  within  Lessee's  control,  this  lease  shall  not  terminate  because  of  such  prevention  ordelay,  and  at  Lessee's  option,  the  period  of  such  prevention  or  delay  shall
