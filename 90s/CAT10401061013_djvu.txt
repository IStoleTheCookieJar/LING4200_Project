FY  1990 


U.S.  agricultural  exports  in  August 
were  stronger  than  expected  fol¬ 
lowing  a  large  decline  in  July.  Im¬ 
ports  declined  to  a  two-year  low, 
helping  to  produce  the  largest  trade 
surplus  for  August  since  1983. 

August  trade  data  released  by  the 
Commerce  Department  on  Oc¬ 
tober  18  placed  U.S.  agricultural  ex¬ 
ports  at  $2.9  billion  and  10.9  million 
metric  tons,  up  $180  million  and 
1.4  million  tons  from  July.  Compared 
with  August  1989,  this  month’s  ex¬ 
ports  also  grew  by  $180  million. 

August’s  performance  brought  the 
cumulative  export  total  (October- 
August)  for  fiscal  1990  to  $37.4  bil¬ 
lion  and  140  million  tons  — an  in¬ 
crease  of  2  percent  in  value  and 
3  percent  in  volume  over  the  same 
11  month  period  last  year. 


Increases  occurred  for  several  com¬ 
modities  such  as  corn  (up  51  percent 
to  $464  million),  soybeans  (up 
37  percent  to  $181  million),  fresh 
fruits  and  vegetables  (up  62  percent 
to  $163  million),  soybean  meal  (up 
56  percent  to  $61  million),  and 
poultry  meat  (up  27  percent  to 
$57  million). 

As  in  recent  months,  wheat  con¬ 
tinued  its  decline  in  August,  drop¬ 
ping  41  percent  to  $327  million. 
Other  declines  came  from  rice  (down 
21  percent  to  $46  million),  tree  nuts 
(down  22  percent  to  $45  million), 
and  soybean  oil  (down  48  percent  to 
$22  million). 


The  United  States  logged  in  export 
gains  to  its  top  four,  'iffarlfets  in 
August.  Japan  had  the  srnahest  igaip, 
4  percent,  but  remained  theTargesp 


v  V*  / 


market  at  $634  million.  The 
European  Community  (EC)  market 
grew  by  16  percent  to  become  the 
second  largest  at  $372  million,  beat¬ 
ing  out  Canada  at  $347  million. 
South  Korea  had  one  of  the  strongest 
increases,  up  43  percent  to  $249  mil¬ 
lion,  to  take  over  the  No.  4  position. 

Other  large  markets  experiencing 
change  were  Saudi  Arabia,  China, 
and  the  Soviet  Union.  Saudi  Arabia, 
the  nineth  largest  market  in  August, 
was  up  47  percent  to  $54  million 
while  exports  to  China  and  the  Soviet 
Union  continued  to  fall  (down 
45  and  83  percent,  respectively). 


Agricultural  imports  for  August  to¬ 
taled  $1.7  billion,  down  $80  million 
from  July  and  $90  million  from 
August  1989.  For  fiscal  1990-to-date, 
imports  totaled  $20.8  billion,  up 
$890  million  from  last  year. 


The  agricultural  trade  surplus  for  the 
month  reached  $1.2  billion.  However, 
the  year-to-date  surplus  of  $16.6  bil¬ 
lion  is  relatively  unchanged  from  last 
year.

Commodity  Highlights 


U.S.  agricultural  exports  in  August  totaled  $2.94  billion,  an  un- 
seasonally  strong  figure  for  what  is  traditionally  one  of  the  slower 
months  of  the  year.  In  fact,  this  is  the  highest  value  on  record  for 
any  August  since  1 980.  Export  value  was  up  7 percent  from  last 
year's  level  while  export  volume  of  10.9  million  tons  was  up  8 per¬ 
cent.  These  gains  advanced  fiscal  year-to-date  exports  to  $37.4  bil¬ 
lion  and  140  million  tons. 


Among  major  commodities, 
stronger  corn  and  sorghum  sales 
resulted  in  the  41-percent  value  and 
35-percent  volume  gains  from  last 
August  in  feed  grain  exports.  Total 
sales  for  the  month  reached 
$557  million  and  4.7  million  tons. 
After  accounting  for  August’s  figures, 
fiscal  year-to-date  exports  totaled 
$7.6  billion  and  65.8  million  tons,  an 
increase  of  11  percent  in  value  and 
17  percent  in  volume  from  last  year. 
Shipments  to  Mexico,  Taiwan,  Korea, 
and  the  EC  remain  strong. 

Wheat  and  flour  exports  experienced 
the  largest  declines  in  August  from  a 
year  ago,  plunging  42  percent  in 
value  to  $337  million  and  31  percent 
in  volume  to  2.5  million  tons.  Lower 
sales  to  China,  Egypt,  Iraq,  and  Al¬ 
geria  were  largely  responsible.  Slug¬ 
gish  monthly  figures  continue  to  keep 
cumulative  exports  far  below  last 
year’s  levels.  For  October-August, 
wheat  and  flour  sales  reached  only 
$4.1  billion  and  26  million  tons  com¬ 
pared  with  $5.6  billion  and  35  million 
tons  for  the  same  period  of  fiscal 
1989. 

With  the  exception  of  wheat  and 
flour,  rice  was  the  only  other  major 
export  item  to  show  value  and 
volume  declines  in  August  from  year 
ago  levels.  Rice  exports  of  $45.5  mil¬ 
lion  and  141,000  tons  fell  $12  million 
and  37,000  tons  from  year-ago  levels 
due  to  a  slowing  in  sales  to  Mexico 
and  a  drop  in  shipments  to  the  Mid¬ 


dle  East.  Cumulative  sales  of 
$764  million  and  2.3  million  tons  also 
continue  to  be  well  below  fiscal 
1989’s  figures. 

In  keeping  with  a  recent  trend, 
August’s  exports  of  soybeans  and 
products  posted  notable  gains  from  a 
year  ago,  rising  $52  million  to 
$264  million  and  345,000  tons  to 
1.1  million  tons.  Increased  shipments 
to  Mexico,  Taiwan,  Venezuela,  and 
Japan  accounted  for  most  of  this 
month’s  advance.  Although  sales  for 
the  previous  2  months  have  also  been 
strong,  year-to-date  value  is  still 
down  from  fiscal  1989,  measuring 
$5.0  billion  compared  with  $5.6  bil¬ 
lion  last  year.  Volume,  however,  at 
21.4  million  tons,  is  up  2.5  million 
tons  from  the  18.9  million  tons  of 
October-August  1989. 

An  increase  in  purchases  from 
Hong  Kong,  China,  and  the  EC  con¬ 
tributed  to  August’s  cotton  sales  of 
$194  million  and  121,000  tons.  For 
the  month,  sales  climbed  17-percent 
in  value  and  7-percent  in  volume 
from  the  year-ago  levels.  Cumulative 
cotton  exports  now  total  $2.6  billion 
and  1.6  million  tons,  36  percent 
higher  in  value  and  17  percent  higher 
in  volume  than  October-August  1989. 

For  yet  another  month,  the  value  of 
unmanufactured  tobacco  exports  sur¬ 
passed  its  year-ago  level  with  sales 
surging  $4.1  million  to  $62.5  million. 
Volume  for  the  month  was  off  slight¬ 
ly,  falling  1,000  tons  from  August 


1989  to  9,700  tons.  For  the  year,  ex¬ 
ports  of  208,000  tons  worth  $1.3  bil¬ 
lion  are  still  above  last  year’s  figures. 
Advances  were  reported  for  all 
major  markets,  except  Japan. 

A  boost  in  sales  of  beef  and  veal  and 
hides  and  skins  were  mainly  respon¬ 
sible  for  the  7  percent  rise  from  last 
August  in  the  value  of  livestock 
product  exports.  For  the  month,  sales 
amounting  to  $450  million  brought 
fiscal  year-to-date  exports  to  $5.0  bil¬ 
lion.  This  is  in  line  with  last  year’s 
sales  of  $4.9  billion.  Among  the  top 
markets,  exports  to  Canada  continue 
to  show  huge  gains  due  in  part  to 
changes  in  data  reporting  methods. 

Exports  of  horticultural  products 
soared  in  August,  thanks  primarily  to 
higher  sales  of  fresh  deciduous  fruits, 
melons,  fruit  and  vegetables  juices, 
and  fresh  vegetables  (excluding 
potatoes).  Export  value  of  $419  mil¬ 
lion  posted  a  31-percent  gain  from 
last  year’s  level  while  export  volume 
of  460,000  tons  increased  6  percent. 

This  year  a  new  record  will  be  set  for 
horticultural  product  sales.  The  11- 
month  cumulative  value  of  $4.7  bil¬ 
lion  has  already  topped  last  year’s 
12-month  record  of  $4.2  billion. 
While  shipments  to  all  principal 
markets  advanced,  sales  to  Canada 
remained  sharply  higher  as  a  result 
of  statistical  reporting  changes. 

Wood  product  sales  were  up  $36  mil¬ 
lion  from  a  year  ago,  reaching 
$566  million  in  August.  Exports  for 
the  year  are  also  up  and,  at  $5.9  bil¬ 
lion,  have  matched  last  year’s  record 
level.  Despite  increased  sales  to  all 
major  markets,  exports  to  Canada 
once  again  show  the  largest  gain.

Country  Spotlight:  Japan 


Recent  FAS  analysis  indicates  that 
the  outlook  for  U.S.  agricultural 
exports  to  Japan  in  the  1990’s  is 
bright.  In  fact,  it  is  likely  to  be  among 
the  strongest  export  growth  markets. 
This  optimism  is  based  on  the  expec¬ 
tation  that  Japan’s  economic  growth, 
while  slowing,  is  expected  to  be  the 
strongest  of  all  industrialized 
countries,  fueling  consumer  demand. 
In  addition,  the  recent  liberalization 
of  some  agricultural  imports,  from 
the  Uruguay  Round,  will  further  add 
to  this  favorable  outlook. 

Since  1964,  when  it  emerged  as 
Asia’s  first  billion-dollar  market  for 
U.S.  farm  products,  Japan  has  steadi¬ 
ly  expanded  its  agricultural  imports. 
In  1988,  Japan’s  imports  of  U.S. 
agricultural  products  exceeded  those 
of  the  EC,  making  Japan  the  largest 
market  for  U.S.  agricultural  exports. 
Japan’s  imports  from  the  United 
States  rose  7  percent  above  1988 
levels  to  $8.2  billion  in  1989,  account¬ 
ing  for  almost  21  percent  of  total 
U.S.  agricultural  exports  to  the 


world.  In  addition,  U.S.  forest 
product  exports  to  Japan  reached 
$2.8  billion  in  1989. 

Although  bulk  commodities  such  as 
corn,  soybeans,  wheat,  cotton,  tobac¬ 
co,  and  logs  dominated  U.S.  exports 
to  Japan  in  1989,  greater  market  ex¬ 
pansion  opportunities  exist  for  high- 
value  items  such  as  beef,  vegetables, 
citrus  fruits,  fruit  juices,  and 
processed  wood  products  including 
veneer,  plywood,  and  particleboard. 

As  a  result  of  the  U.S.-Japan  Beef 
Agreement  in  1988,  Japan’s  beef  im¬ 
ports  have  grown  significantly. 
Japan’s  beef  imports  from  the 
United  States,  which  totaled 
$556  million  in  1987,  increased 
80  percent  to  $1.0  billion  by  1989. 
Under  the  agreement,  restrictions  on 
Japan’s  beef  imports  are  being 
phased  out  over  two  3-year  periods. 
During  the  first,  quotas  on  beef  im¬ 
ports  were  expanded  by  60,000  tons 
annually  from  a  base  of  214,000  tons. 
They  will  be  eliminated  by 
April  1,  1991.  In  the  second,  the  cur¬ 
rent  25-percent  tariff  will  be  raised  to 
70  percent,  reduced  to  60  percent  in 
1992,  and  50  percent  in  1993.  An  ad¬ 
ditional  25-percent  tariff  may  be  im¬ 
plemented  if  imports  reach  120  per¬ 
cent  of  the  previous  year’s  level. 

U.S.  exports  of  fresh,  frozen,  and 
prepared  vegetables  to  Japan,  which 


Protectionism  and  Japanese  Rice: 

Rice  is  one  of  Japan’s  most  protected  agricultural  products.  In  order  to 
maintain  domestic  prices  at  levels  significantly  higher  than  world  prices,  the 
Government  of  Japan  (GOJ)  essentially  prohibits  the  import  of  rice.  The 
GOJ’s  control  over  rice  imports  served  as  the  basis  for  the  unfair  trade 
complaints  (Section  301)  submitted  by  the  U.S.  rice  industry  in  1986  and 
1988.  Although  Japan’s  current  rice  program  is  clearly  indefensible  under 
the  GATT,  the  United  States  Trade  Representative  rejected  both  of  these 
petitions,  believing  that  the  Uruguay  Round  of  multilateral  trade  negotia¬ 
tions  is  more  likely  to  resolve  the  situation  than  a  Section  301  case.  While 
Japan  made  cuts  in  its  support  price  for  rice  in  JFY  1987,  JFY  1988  and 
again  in  JFY  1990  — the  first  in  30  years  — import  controls  remain  in  place. 


totaled  $253  million  in  1989,  also  in¬ 
creased  greatly  in  the  past  few  years. 
In  particular,  frozen  french  fry  ex¬ 
ports  doubled  in  the  7  years  from 
1983  to  1989,  rising  from  $37  million 
to  $79  million.  Japan  maintains  a 
high  (95  percent)  self-sufficiency  rate 
for  vegetables,  supported  by  a  price 
stabilization  system. 

Japan’s  citrus  fruit  and  fruit  juice 
markets  also  offer  good  oppor¬ 
tunities.  Under  the  U.S.-Japan  Citrus 
Agreement  (signed  on  July  5,  1988) 
and  the  1988  GATT-11  Agreement 
(signed  on  August  2,  1988),  orange 
and  orange  juice  import  quotas  will 
be  eliminated  on  April  1,  1991  and 
April  1,  1992,  respectively.  The 
GATT-11  Agreement  resolved  a 
long-standing  trade  dispute  on 
11  categories  of  processed  products. 
In  1989,  the  United  States  dominated 
Japan’s  citrus  market  with  sales  of 
$307  million. 

Processed  forest  product  exports  to 
Japan  have  been  hindered  by  high 
tariffs  and  rigid  testing  and  certifica¬ 
tion  procedures,  standards,  and 
building  codes.  In  response  to  pres¬ 
sures  from  the  United  States  and 
other  trading  partners,  the  Japanese 
government  agreed  to  implement 
changes  in  1986.  In  April  1987,  tariff 
reductions  on  14  wood  products 
were  implemented. 

Further  reductions  in  plywood  tariffs 
were  implemented  in  1988  and  will 
be  made  in  the  Uruguay  Round 
negotiations.  Also,  Japan  has  revised 
its  standards  and  certification  system 
and  tariff  classification  of  laminate 
veneer  products.  After  the  con¬ 
clusion  of  the  talks  with  the 
United  States  on  April  1,  1990, 
Japanese  imports  of  processed  wood 
products  increased  substantially.

Trade  Highlights  -  5 


Increased  Imports  of  Meat  and  Juice  Keep 
Competitive  Imports  Moving  Toward  Record  Levels 


U.S.  agricultural  imports  in  August 
totaled  $1.7  billion,  down  4  per¬ 
cent  from  July  and  5  percent  from 
last  August.  This  was  the  third 
highest  level  on  record  for  the  month 
of  August.  With  only  1  month  left  in 
fiscal  1990,  cumulative  imports  (Oc¬ 
tober-August)  have  grown  to 
$20.8  billion,  $890  million  higher  than 
the  same  period  a  year  ago. 

Competitive  product  imports  have 
been  strong  all  year  and  for  August 
were  $1.3  billion,  up  2  percent  from  a 
year  ago,  but  down  4  percent  from 
July.  Cumulative  imports,  totaling 
$15.6  billion,  are  up  $1.5  billion  from 
last  year.  They  are  certain  to  end  the 
year  at  an  all-time  high. 

Animal  and  animal  product  imports 
continued  above  last  year’s  levels,  up 
12  percent  from  year  ago.  Through 
August,  imports  totaled  $5.1  billion, 
up  12  percent  from  last  year.  Beef 
and  veal  imports  are  up  19  percent 


Competitive  imports  are  cer¬ 
tain  to  end  the  year  at  an  all- 
time  high. 

for  the  year  in  value  and  up  11  per¬ 
cent  in  volume.  Higher  imports  from 
Australia  accounted  for  nearly  all  of 
the  increase. 

Pork  import  value  in  August  con¬ 
tinued  strong  at  $88  million,  up 
38  percent  from  last  year.  So  far,  fis¬ 
cal  year  pork  imports  of  $813  million 
are  up  13  percent  from  fiscal  1989, 
despite-  a  10-percent  drop  in  import 
volume.  Increased  imports  from  the 
EC  and  Canada,  up  roughly  20  per¬ 
cent  for  the  year  in  value  and  un¬ 
changed  in  volume,  have  accounted 
for  the  higher  import  values. 

Imports  of  fruits  and  juices  were  up 
$30  million  (31  percent)  from  last 
August,  with  95  percent  of  the  in¬ 
crease  due  to  higher  juice  imports. 


Orange  juice  imports  were  up 
$22  million.  Imports  of  fruit  juices 
from  Brazil,  the  largest  supplier, 
were  up  $18  million  while  imports 
from  Chile  were  up  $3  million  from 
last  August. 

Imports  of  beet  and  cane  sugar  for 
the  fiscal  year  are  up  10  percent  in 
value  ($60  million),  but  volume  is 
down  7  percent.  For  the  month,  im¬ 
ports  were  down  $50  million  (53  per¬ 
cent)  from  August  1989.  Imports  for 
the  year  from  major  suppliers  are 
mixed.  Major  dollar  value  increases 
occurred  for  Guatemala  (up  220  per¬ 
cent),  Colombia  (up  75  percent), 
Brazil  (up  60  percent),  and  the 
Philippines  (up  15  percent).  Declines 
were  shown  for  Australia  (down 
60  percent)  and  the  Dominican 
Republic  (down  15  percent). 

Noncompetitive  product  imports  for 
August  totaled  $422  million,  down 
6  percent  from  July  and  22  percent 
from  last  August.  Noncompetitive 
imports  for  the  year  total  $5.2  billion, 
down  $590  million  from  the  same 
period  last  year.  Year-to-date  im¬ 
ports  of  coffee,  rubber,  and  spices 
are  down  $776  million  (22  percent) 
from  last  year’s  levels.  These  declines 
more  than  offset  increased  imports 
of  cocoa  and  products  (up  $69  mil¬ 
lion),  bananas  (up  $66  million),  and 
teas  (up  $19  million).  At  $96  million, 
cocoa  product  imports  reached  their 
highest  level  since  September  1987.

World  Macroeconomic  Outlook 


The  global  economy  is  expected  to 
grow  at  a  slower  rate  in  1990,  fol¬ 
lowing  a  number  of  years  of  more 
rapid  expansion.  The  slowdown 
reflects  lower  economic  growth  rates 
for  the  industrial  and  developing 
countries  and  an  economic  contrac¬ 
tion  in  Eastern  Europe  and  the 
USSR. 

According  to  preliminary  projections 
by  the  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF),  world  economic  growth  is  ex¬ 
pected  to  slow  to  about  2  percent  in 
1990,  the  lowest  rate  since  1982.  It  is 
expected  to  rise  slightly  in  1991.  The 
world  outlook  for  the  remainder  of 
1990  and  for  1991  remains  heavily 
dependent  on  future  developments  in 
the  ongoing  Persian  Gulf  crisis. 

The  Gulf  crisis  has  shaken  world 
equity  markets  and  caused  a  sharp 
rise  in  world  crude  oil  prices.  Follow¬ 
ing  Iraq’s  invasion  of  neighboring 
Kuwait,  oil  prices  doubled,  rising 
from  $18  per  barrel  before  the  crisis 
to  more  than  $40.  More  recently,  oil 
prices  have  fallen  to  around  $30  per 
barrel.  The  future  direction  of  oil 
prices  depends  critically  on  develop¬ 
ments  in  the  Middle  East. 

If  sustained,  the  direct  effect  of  the 
Gulf  crisis  —  sharply  higher  world  oil 


prices  — will  strike  hard  at  many 
countries.  The  Gulf  crisis  will  slow 
growth  in  the  industrialized 
countries,  pushing  the  U.S.  economy 
closer  to  a  possible  recession  and 
trimming  economic  growth  in  the 
more  buoyant  economies  of  Japan 
and  Western  Europe.  The  hardest  hit 
countries  will  be  large  oil-importing 
developing  countries  that  were  facing 
economic  difficulties  before  the  steep 
rise  in  oil  prices. 

Who  stands  to  gain  from  the  crisis? 
Clearly,  large  net  oil  exporting 
countries  will  benefit  from  higher  oil 
prices.  However,  many  countries  that 
directly  benefit  from  higher  oil  prices 
will  suffer  the  more  indirect  effects 
that  are  likely  to  result  from  the 
crisis:  a  further  slowing  in  the  growth 
of  the  world  economy  and  world 
trade,  and  upward  pressures  on 
prices  and  world  interest  rates. 

In  addition  to  higher  oil  prices,  many 
countries  will  suffer  from  the  ancil¬ 
lary  effects  of  the  Gulf  crisis.  For  ex¬ 
ample,  the  present  United  Nations 
(U.N.)  economic  sanctions  against 
Iraq  will  negatively  impact  the 
economies  of  a  number  of  countries 
which  relied  on  trade  with  Iraq 
and/or  Kuwait.  Also,  countries  which 
had  major  overseas  work  forces  in 


Iraq  and  Kuwait  will  experience 
reduced  worker  remittances. 
Countries  in  the  Middle  East  and 
South  Asia  will  be  the  most  affected 
by  the  trade  restrictions  and  the  cut¬ 
off  in  worker  remittances. 

Although  the  Middle  East  situation 
and  developments  in  the  petroleum 
sector  are  important  determinants  in 
the  world  economic  situation  and 
outlook,  other  major  factors  influenc¬ 
ing  world  growth  are: 

•  Outcome  of  the  GATT  negotia¬ 
tions; 

•  Integration  of  the  European 
Community; 

•  Prospects  for  fundamental 
economic  reforms  in  the  USSR 
and  Eastern  Europe; 

•  Consequences  of  German  unifica¬ 
tion; 

•  Continued  use  of  restrictive 
monetary  policies  to  stem  infla¬ 
tion  in  major  industrialized 
countries;  and 

•  Large  external  debt  problems  in 
many  developing  countries,  espe¬ 
cially  those  in  Latin  America. 

Industrialized  Countries 

Real  economic  growth  in  the  in¬ 
dustrialized  countries  is  expected  to 
slow  to  about  2.6  percent  in  1990  and 
slow  slightly  to  2.4  percent  in  1991. 
The  industrialized  economies  grew  at 
more  robust  rates  of  3.4  percent  in 
1989  and  4.4  percent  in  1988. 

Sharply  higher  oil  prices  will  nega¬ 
tively  impact  industrialized  countries 
which  are  large  oil  consumers  and 
are  heavily  dependent  on  oil  imports. 
Higher  oil  prices  will  drive  up  the  oil 
import  bill  for  the  industrialized 
world,  slow  economic  activity  and 
put  upward  pressure  on  prices  and 
interest  rates.  In  the  United  States, 
higher  oil  prices  will  substantially 
boost  the  oil  import  bill  and  further 
weaken  the  economy.  Rising  fuel 
costs  will  filter  through  the  U.S.

economy  adding  to  already  wor¬ 
risome  price  inflation  and  keep  up¬ 
ward  pressure  on  interest  rates.  The 
more  buoyant  economies  of  Japan 
and  Western  Europe  will  find  it 
easier  to  adjust  to  higher  oil  prices, 
despite  their  larger  relative  depend¬ 
ence  on  oil  imports. 

Economic  growth  in  Japan  is  ex¬ 
pected  to  remain  relatively  high, 
despite  the  obvious  negative  impacts 
of  rising  oil  prices  and  the  recent  tur¬ 
bulence  in  the  domestic  equity 
markets.  Higher  oil  prices  will  add 
further  upward  pressure  on  already 
rising  inflation  and  interest  rates.  In¬ 
creasing  monetary  tightness,  which 
causes  a  currency  to  appreciate 
against  other  currencies,  making  im¬ 
ports  denominated  in  other  curren¬ 
cies— including  oil  — less  expensive, 
will  help  partially  counterbalance  the 
impact  of  higher  oil  prices. 

The  economic  outlook  for  Western 
Europe  is  relatively  bright,  par¬ 
ticularly  given  major  developments 
sweeping  the  continent  — movement 
toward  EC  economic  integration, 
German  unification,  and  the  momen¬ 
tous  changes  occurring  in  Eastern 
Europe  and  the  USSR.  The  process 
of  economic  integration  is  expected 
to  boost  investment  and  sustain  high 
rates  of  output  growth  in  the  EC. 
Although  there  will  be  short-term 
disruptions,  in  the  longer  run 
Western  Europe  is  expected  to  reap 
economic  and  political  benefits  from 
the  ongoing  economic  and  political 
liberalization  in  Eastern  Europe  and 
the  USSR.  Also,  economic  prospects 
for  Germany  will  ultimately  be  en¬ 
hanced  by  reunification. 

Developing  Countries 

Real  economic  growth  in  developing 
countries  is  expected  to  decline  from 
the  3-percent  registered  in  1989  to 
about  2.2  percent  in  1990.  This  slow¬ 
down  reflects  unfavorable  external 


conditions,  slowing  growth  in  world 
trade,  high  international  interest 
rates,  and  declining  prices  for  non-oil 
primary  commodities.  The  IMF 
projects  that  higher  world  oil  prices 
($25/barrel)  would  have  a  small,  net 
positive  impact  on  economic  growth 
in  the  developing  countries.  This 
conclusion  reflects  the  fact  that  a 
number  of  countries  in  this  group  are 
substantial  net  exporters  of  oil. 

For  Mexico,  Indonesia,  Venezuela, 
Nigeria,  and  other  net  oil  exporting 
countries  that  are  also  large  debtors, 
higher  oil  prices  will  help  partially 
ease  strained  financial  situations. 
However,  the  ongoing  crisis  will  keep 


upward  pressure  on  interest  rates 
and  will  likely  not  allow  any  sig¬ 
nificant  drop  in  debt  servicing  re¬ 
quirements. 

Oil  importers,  particularly  countries 
with  large  external  debts,  will  be  par¬ 
ticularly  hard  hit  by  the  combined  ef¬ 
fects  of  higher  oil  prices  and  the 
prospects  for  continued  high  world 
interest  rates.  Growth  prospects  are 
especially  poor  for  many  heavily  in¬ 
debted  developing  countries  in 
Africa,  the  Western  Hemisphere,  and 
Asia. 

Aggregate  economic  growth  for 
developing  countries  is  expected  to 
rebound  to  a  more  robust  4.2  percent

rate  in  1991.  However,  this  optimis¬ 
tic  economic  outlook  will  depend 
greatly  on  future  world  develop¬ 
ments,  particularly  events  in  the  Per¬ 
sian  Gulf. 

The  economic  outook  for  the  Asian 
NIC’s  and  most  of  the  ASEAN 
countries  remains  relatively 
favorable,  although  growth  is  ex¬ 
pected  to  slow  from  the  rapid  pace 
of  the  last  few  years.  Indonesia, 
Malaysia,  and  Brunei,  which  are  oil 
producers  and  exporters,  will  directly 
benefit  from  higher  oil  prices.  The 
economies  in  this  region,  which  are 
heavily  dependent  on  trade,  will  suf¬ 
fer  greatly  from  any  significant 
downturn  in  world  trade  or  any  sub¬ 
stantial  drop  in  economic  activity  in 
their  major  export  markets  in  the 
United  States  and  Western  Europe. 

Most  major  oil  exporting  nations  en¬ 
joyed  higher  prices  for  their  oil  in 
1989  and  will  receive  still  higher 
prices  in  1990.  Many  OPEC 
countries  will  see  sharp  increases  in 
their  oil  revenues,  the  combined  ef¬ 
fect  of  higher  oil  prices  and  in  some 
cases  increased  export  volume.  The 
notable  exceptions  are  countries 
directly  involved  in  the  current 
crisis  — Iraq,  Kuwait,  and  possibly 
Saudi  Arabia.  Other  large  non- 


OPEC  oil  exporters,  such  as  Mexico, 
also  will  reap  the  windfall  of  higher 
oil  prices. 

Centrally  Planned  Economies 

The  short-term  economic  prospects 
for  Eastern  Europe  and  the  USSR 
are  not  bright.  According  to  figures 
from  the  IMF,  the  USSR  and  the 
economies  of  Eastern  Europe  are  ex¬ 
pected  to  contract  by  nearly  3  per¬ 
cent  in  1990  and  economic  growth  is 
expected  to  remain  negative  in  1991. 

Economic  output  in  Eastern  Europe 
is  expected  to  decline  in  1990  and 
remain  stagnant  through  1991  due  in 
large  part  to  the  short-run  impacts  of 
stabilization  measures  and  current 
economic  reforms.  Eastern  Europe  is 
saddled  with  heavy  debt  loads.  In¬ 
creasing  expenditures  for  oil  imports 
will  make  it  more  difficult  to  balance 
external  accounts  and  meet  debt  ser¬ 
vicing  requirements.  Higher  oil 
prices  and  the  phaseout  of  sub¬ 
sidized,  low-cost  oil  from  the  USSR 
will  cause  a  further  deterioration  in 
the  short-term  economic  prospects 
for  the  region. 

Short-term  economic  prospects  for 
the  USSR  are  poor.  As  in  Eastern 
Europe,  current  economic  reforms 


and  a  movement  toward  a  more 
market  oriented  economy  will  cause 
major  disruptions  in  the  Soviet 
economy.  The  USSR,  the  world’s 
largest  oil  producer  and  major  ex¬ 
porter,  will  benefit  from  higher  oil 
prices  and  the  phasing-out  of  below- 
market  priced  “sales”  of  oil  to  East¬ 
ern  Europe  and  elsewhere. 

Economic  prospects  for  the  USSR 
and  many  countries  in  Eastern 
Europe  would  be  enhanced  by  a 
favorable  decision  on  their  requests 
for  membership  in  the  IMF  and  the 
World  Bank. 

Happenings  in  the  Oil  Market 

The  world  economic  outlook  remains 
dependent  on  developments  in  the 
Gulf  situation  and  on  world  oil 
prices.  Oil  prices  rose  sharply  in  1989 
and  remained  volatile  in  the  first  half 
of  1990.  In  a  July  1990  OPEC  meet¬ 
ing,  the  official  crude  oil  reference 
price  was  raised  to  $21  a  barrel  after 
remaining  at  $18  per  barrel  since 
February  1987.  Following  the  in¬ 
vasion  of  Kuwait,  spot  oil  prices 
soared  to  about  $40  per  barrel  before 
falling  to  around  $30.  Immediately 
prior  to  the  outbreak  of  hostilities, 
oil  was  trading  at  about  $18  a  barrel. 
Although,  these  are  major  price  in¬ 
creases  they  are  relatively  less  than 
the  oil  price  “shocks”  of  1973-74  and 
1978-80  when  oil  prices  quadrupled 
and  trebled,  respectively. 

The  oil  price  outlook  for  the 
remainder  of  1990  and  for  1991  will 
also  depend  oil  production  by  OPEC 
and  non-OPEC  members.  Immedi¬ 
ately  before  the  crisis,  world  oil  in¬ 
ventories  were  abundant  and  the 
growth  of  world  oil  consumption  was 
expected  to  moderate  due  to  a  slow¬ 
down  in  the  world  economy.  Higher 
oil  prices  should  stimulate  world  oil 
production.  A  majority  of  OPEC 
members  agreed  on  August  29  to 
suspend  production  ceilings.  Prior  to

the  Iraqi  invasion  of  Kuwait,  OPEC 
members  had  an  idle  capacity  of 
4  million  barrels  a  day,  roughly 
equivalent  to  the  combined  pre-crisis 
export  level  of  Iraq  and  Kuwait.  Ad¬ 
ditionally,  governments  of  major  in¬ 
dustrial  countries  hold  strategic 
petroleum  reserves  totaling  about 
1  billion  barrels. 

Higher  oil  prices  will  add  significant¬ 
ly  to  the  import  bill  of  most  in¬ 
dustrialized  countries.  In  1989,  for 
example,  net  oil  imports  for  the  in¬ 
dustrialized  (OECD)  countries  to¬ 
taled  7.35  billion  barrels.  At  this 
same  yearly  import  volume,  a 
one  dollar  increase  in  oil  prices  rep¬ 
resents  an  additional  $7.35  billion  on 
OECD’s  annual  U.S.  dollar- 
denominated  oil  import  bill.  At  the 
pre-crisis  level  of  $18  a  barrel,  this 
annual  oil  import  volume  would  cost 
the  OECD  countries  about  $132  bil¬ 
lion.  At  $40  a  barrel,  the  import  bill 
for  OECD  countries  would  soar  to 
nearly  $300  billion. 

Annual  oil  import  data  for  the  major 
OECD  countries  is  presented  in  the 
table  below.  Note  that  the 
United  Kingdom  and  Canada  are  net 
oil  exporters. 


Implications  for  U.S.  Exports 

Mapping  the  impact  of  sustained 
higher  oil  prices  on  U.S.  agricultural 
exports  is  complicated  by  a  myriad  of 
economic  and  financial  effects.  Ac¬ 
cording  to  recent  IMF  estimates, 
higher  oil  prices  are  expected  to  slow 
global  economic  growth  and  the 
growth  of  world  trade.  If  so,  one 
would  expect  U.S.  agricultural  ex¬ 
ports  to  suffer. 

However,  during  the  oil  shocks  of  the 
1970s,  higher  oil  prices  were  accom¬ 
panied  by  higher  U.S.  farm  exports 
as  vast  amounts  of  petrodollars  were 
recycled  through  the  world  economy 
via  increased  OPEC  deposits  in 
Western  banks. 

A  recent  analysis  by  economists  of 
USDA’s  Economic  Research  Service 
(ERS)  suggests  this  could  happen 
again.  Larger  cash  deposits  in  large 
commerical  banks  would  put 
downward  pressure  on  interest  rates 
which,  if  combined  with  higher  infla¬ 
tion,  could  result  in  negative  real  in¬ 
terest  rates,  thereby  spurring  in¬ 
creased  commodity  purchases  by  our 
overseas  customers.  If  this  scenario 
comes  to  pass,  the  ERS  analysis  indi¬ 
cates  the  cumulative  rise  in  U.S. 


agricultural  exports  could  reach 
$3  billion  over  the  next  3  years. 

While  these  two  scenarios  suggest 
very  different  outcomes  for  U.S.  ex¬ 
ports,  the  impact  of  higher  oil  prices 
will  depend  on  the  response  of  oil 
exporters  to  increased  oil  receipts 
and  the  response  of  the  world’s 
central  banks  to  the  prospects  for 
higher  global  inflation  and  interest 
rates. 

Higher  oil  prices  and  the  resulting 
upward  pressure  on  world  price  and 
interest  rates  will  hit  debtor  countries 
that  are  net  importers  of  oil  and 
major  markets  for  agricultural 
products  hard.  Counterbalancing 
this,  large  net  oil  exporters  will 
receive  sharply  higher  revenues  for 
their  oil  exports  and  should  present 
better  export  prospects  for  U.S. 
agricultural  products. 

The  relatively  fast  growing 
economies  of  East  and  Southeast 
Asia  will  likely  continue  to  offer  the 
best  prospects  for  U.S.  agricultural 
exports.  Bouyant  economic  growth 
prospects  in  Western  Europe  would 
suggest  increased  export  oppor¬ 
tunities,  but  EC  integration  could 
reduce  U.S.  chances  to  share  in  this 
growth.  Over  the  short-term, 
economic  upheavel  in  Eastern 
Europe  and  the  USSR  and  strained 
financial  conditions  could  limit  com¬ 
mercial  agricultural  sales  opportun- 
ties  to  these  markets. 

Of  course,  U.N.  economic  sanctions 
will  result  in  the  loss  of  the  large 
agricultural  market  in  Iraq  and 
Kuwait.  In  1989,  the  U.S.  exported 
$726  million  in  agricultural  products 
to  Iraq  and  $59  million  to  Kuwait. 
Iraq  was  a  large  market  for  U.S.  rice,

Trade  Policy  Updates 


Update  on 

Uruguay  Round 

Participants  in  the  Uruguay  Round  Negotiations  on  Agriculture,  under  the  General 
Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT),  spent  the  first  2  weeks  in  October  submitting 
“country  lists”  which  detail  the  specifics  of  their  agricultural  policies.  These  lists  will 
provide  a  database  from  which  to  negotiate  an  agreement  on  how  to  reduce  trade-dis¬ 
torting  support  and  protection  in  agriculture. 

Final  proposals  from  the  United  States  and  from  the  Cairns  Group  (a  negotiating  bloc 
including  Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  11  other  countries)  were  closely  modeled  on  a 
framework  document  prepared  by  Aart  de  Zeeuw,  Chairman  of  the  Agriculture 
Negotiating  Group.  This  document  outlined  an  approach  for  significant  reform  in  the 
areas  of  internal  subsidies,  export  subsidies,  and  import  protection.  Other  proposals, 
such  as  Japan’s,  were  not  modeled  significantly  on  the  de  Zeeuw  text. 

An  entire  agreement  on  new  GATT  rules  and  disciplines  to  govern  agricultural  trade 
based  on  the  submitted  proposals  will  be  completed  at  a  ministerial  level  meeting  in 
Brussels,  beginning  December  3. 

Japan  Notifies  GATT  of 
Intent  To  Certify 

New  Food  Additives 

On  October  3,  the  Government  of  Japan  (GOJ)  notified  the  GATT  of  its  intention  to 
add  seven  new  food  additives  to  its  list  of  approved  additives  for  use  in  Japan.  One 
additive  nominated  by  the  United  States,  red  dye  #40  (allura  red),  is  included  in  the 
list. 

The  GATT  notification  represents  a  major  step  on  the  part  of  the  GOJ  and  now  indi¬ 
cates  its  firm  commitment  to  formally  approve  these  additives  for  use  by  early  1991. 
Japan’s  restrictions  on  food  additives  have  held  exports  of  U.S.  processed  foods  below 
potential  levels.  Of  37  food  additives  proposed  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administra¬ 
tion  (FDA)  in  1985,  only  two  have  so  far  been  approved.  The  United  States  has  com¬ 
plained  to  the  GOJ  about  the  lack  of  transparency  in  their  additive  approval  process, 
and  a  proposal  by  the  GOJ  for  a  bilateral  meeting  on  the  subject  is  being  considered  by 
U.S.  agencies. 

Japan  Protests 

U.S.  Log  Export  Ban 

GOJ  officials,  at  the  U.S. -Japan  Trade  Committee  Meeting  in  Washington,  October  2-3, 
expressed  dissatisfaction  with  the  tightening  of  U.S.  log  export  restrictions.  In  line  with 
earlier  expressions  of  concern,  the  GOJ  alleged  that  the  log  export  restrictions  are 
GATT  inconsistent.  Japan  has  asked  for  access  to  logs  on  an  equal  basis  with  U.S. 
industry. 

As  a  result  of  the  ban,  500  to  600  million  board  feet  of  lumber  will  no  longer  be  avail¬ 
able  for  export,  but  Japan  will  continue  to  have  access  to  30  billion  board  feet  of  lumber 
in  1990.  The  GOJ  estimated  that  for  1990  its  access  to  log  imports  will  be  restricted  to 
15  to  20  percent  of  1989  levels;  U.S.  estimates  put  that  figure  at  11  to  13  percent,  but  in 
fact  the  short-term  impact  should  not  affect  shipments  until  late  1991  due  to  existing 
stockpiles  and  forward  contracts. 

Chile  Signs  Framework 
Agreement  with  the 

United  States 

On  October  1,  Chile  became  the  fourth  Latin  American  country,  joining  Bolivia, 
Colombia  and  Ecuador,  to  sign  a  bilateral  Trade  and  Investment  Framework  Agreement 
with  the  United  States.  The  mechanism  of  framework  agreements  was  a  key  element  of 
the  President’s  Enterprise  for  the  Americas  Initiative.  The  purpose  of  these  agreements 
is  to  establish  a  Trade  and  Investment  Council  (TIC)  to  serve  as  a  forum  for  estab¬ 
lishing  principles  and  means  for  achieving  cooperation  on  trade  and  investment  issues.

Trade  Policy  Updates 


The  President  Formally 
Notifies  Congress  of  FTA 
Negotiations  With  Mexico 

On  September  27,  President  Bush  formally  notified  the  House  Committee  on  Ways  and 
Means  and  the  Senate  Finance  Committee  of  free  trade  negotiations  with  Mexico.  The 
letters  of  notification  expressed  the  President’s  expectation  that  any  such  agreement  will 
build  on  U.S.  multilateral  negotiating  efforts  in  the  Uruguay  Round. 

Canada  Announces 

Intent  To  Participate  in 
Trade  Talks  With  U.S. 
and  Mexico 

Canada’s  Trade  Minister  announced  on  September  24  that  Canada  has  decided  to  par¬ 
ticipate  in  discussions  with  Mexico  and  the  United  States  to  establish  the  basis  for  sub¬ 
sequent  negotiations  on  a  free  trade  arrangement  among  Canada,  the  United  States, 
and  Mexico.  According  to  the  announcement,  Prime  Minister  Mulroney  has  written 
letters  to  President  Salinas  and  President  Bush  stating  Canada’s  interest  in  participating 
in  negotiations  on  a  North  America  Free  Trade  Agreement.  Mexico  is  now  Canada’s 
largest  trading  partner  in  Latin  America. 

China  GATT  Accession 
Meeting  Concludes  With 
No  Date  for  Next  Meeting 

The  10th  meeting  of  the  GATT  Contracting  Parties  regarding  China’s  request  to  join 
the  GATT  was  held  on  September  20-21  in  Geneva.  No  substantive  progress  was  made, 
and  there  was  no  mention  of  starting  work  on  a  protocol.  China  presented  an  update  of 
market  reform  measures  taken  since  the  last  working  party  meeting  in  December  1989. 

Agreement  Reached  with 
Canada  on  Broiler 
Hatching  Eggs  and  Chick 
Quotas 

After  10  months  of  negotiating,  the  United  States  has  reached  agreement  with  Canada 
regarding  access  levels  for  broiler  hatching  eggs  and  chicks.  The  combined  access  level 
for  both  chicks  and  eggs  for  any  one  year  has  been  set  at  21.1  percent  of  the  estimated 
Canadian  domestic  production  of  broiler  hatching  eggs  for  that  year. 

The  accord  provides  for  separate  and  distinct  access  levels  for  hatching  eggs  and 
chicks,  a  particularly  significant  concession  to  the  U.S.  industry  given  the  lateness  of  the 
agreement  in  the  current  year.  The  accord  does  not  prejudice  the  U.S.  right  to  chal¬ 
lenge  the  quotas  as  inconsistent  with  GATT  rules  if  Canada  has  not  eliminated  them  by 
the  end  of  the  Uruguay  Round. 

Venezuela  Announces  a 
New  Tariff  Schedule  for 
Agricultural  Commodities 

The  Government  of  Venezuela  recently  announced  its  decision  to  relax  trade  barriers 
for  a  variety  of  agricultural  goods.  The  reforms,  which  went  into  effect  on  August  1, 
remove  the  import  permit  requirements  for  protein  meals,  but  retain  them  for  soybeans, 
sunflowerseed,  and  cottonseed  for  crushing  and  for  their  oils. 

The  import  tariff  for  soybean  meal  was  reduced  from  15  to  10  percent  while  the  tariff 
for  soybeans  remains  the  same  at  10  percent.  The  ad  valorem  import  tax  on  crude 
soybean  oil,  however,  was  raised  to  20  percent,  on  a  par  with  refined  oil.  The  net  effect 
of  these  measures  should  be  to  improve  prospects  for  Venezuelan  imports  of  soybeans 
and  soybean  meal.  Virtually  all  of  Venezuela’s  soybean  imports  normally  come  from  the 
United  States,  while  about  90-95  percent  of  the  soybean  meal  is  of  U.S.  origin. 

Pending  Marketing  Order 
Legislation  Challenged  in 
GATT  Council 

At  the  October  3  meeting  of  the  GATT  Council,  representatives  from  Argentina,  Peru, 
Mexico,  Uruguay,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand  joined  Chile  in  condemning  legislation 
pending  in  the  U.S.  Congress  which  would  extend  marketing  orders  to  kiwifruit,  nec¬ 
tarines,  plums,  papayas,  pistachios,  and  apples.  Chile  has  persistently  charged  that 
marketing  orders  are  a  discriminatory  trade  barrier.  The  U.S.  delegation  protested  that 
it  is  inappropriate  to  challenge  in  the  GATT  Council  a  measure  that  has  been  proposed, 
especially  one  that  has  never  been  the  subject  of  the  GATT  dispute  settlement  process.

Market  Updates 


Peru  To  Buy  Rice 

Peru  could  be  a  major  market  for  U.S.  rice  for  the  second  consecutive  year  due  to 
another  drought-impacted  crop  and  rising  consumption.  Since  stocks  are  expected  to 
be  critically  low  by  November,  Peru  has  called  for  imports  of  100,000  tons  toward  pur¬ 
chases  expected  to  reach  250,000-350,000  tons  by  March.  Last  year  Peru  bought  half  of 
its  350,000  tons  from  the  United  States,  but  U.S.  market  share  could  be  even  greater 
this  year.  A  recent  softening  of  U.S.  prices  combined  with  an  increase  in  Thai  quotes 
and  a  quiet  Vietnamese  market  should  make  landed  U.S.  prices  very  competitive. 

Yugoslavia  Needs 

To  Import  Corn 

Yugoslav  corn  imports  could  be  in  the  2-2.5  million  ton  range  compared  with  current 
estimates  of  500,000  tons,  given  reports  that  the  crop  could  be  the  smallest  in  25  years. 
However,  expanded  wheat  feeding  from  a  larger  harvest  could  partially  mitigate  some 
need  for  imported  corn.  An  indication  of  the  severity  of  the  problem  is  the  fact  that 
the  embassy  has  already  had  inquiries  about  the  availability  of  GSM-102  credits  for 
corn. 

EC  Raises  Production 
Subsidy  for  Casein 

On  September  29,  the  European  Economic  Community  increased  the  casein  produc¬ 
tion  subsidy.  The  subsidy  was  raised  from  6.64  ECU  ($8.87)  per  100  kilograms  of  liquid 
skim  milk  to  7.94  ECU  ($10.61)  per  100  kilograms,  a  20-percent  increase.  EC  analysts 
believe  the  amount  of  the  increase  will  have  a  significant  effect  in  improving  the  com¬ 
petitive  position  of  EC  casein  in  the  world  market,  but  the  New  Zealand  Dairy  Board 
(NZDB)  claims  that  it  will  only  force  down  prices  without  expanding  use.  (The  NZDB 
claim  may  be  accurate  for  the  very  short  term.)  The  Dairy  Management  Committee  of 
the  EC  has  also  increased  the  aid  for  using  skim  milk  powder  in  animal  feed  from 
59.90  ECU  ($80.02)  per  100  kilograms  to  70.00  ECU  ($93.51)  per  100  kilograms. 

New  EC  Legislation 

Calls  for  Spot  Checks  on 

Export  Refunds 

Based  on  the  findings  of  a  report  issued  by  the  Commission’s  Court  of  Auditors  last 
May,  describing  the  export  refund  system  as  a  high-risk  area  for  fraud,  two  new  regula¬ 
tions  were  added  outlining  procedures  for  stricter  verification  of  exports.  The  risks 
described  in  the  Court’s  report  involved  the  payment  of  refunds  at  an  excessive  rate  for 
the  product  involved,  or  the  payment  of  refunds  on  goods  that  are  never  exported. 
These  regulations  require  random  spot  checks  on  at  least  5  percent  of  all  shipments 
over  5  tons  to  third  countries  for  which  refunds  are  being  claimed.  These  new  regula¬ 
tions  apply  to  all  agricultural  commodities  using  export  refunds. 

Effort  To  Override 

Veto  of  Restrictive 

Textile  Import  Bill  Fails 

The  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  failed  to  muster  the  required  two-thirds  majority 
vote  needed  to  override  President  Bush’s  veto  of  a  recent  bill  designed  to  further 
restrict  the  import  of  textile  products  into  the  United  States.  The  proposed  quota 
would  have  placed  a  1-percent  annual  cap  on  the  growth  of  textile  imports,  allowing  for 
growth  in  U.S.  textile  demand.  While  pro-quota  advocates  point  to  the  need  to  protect 
the  domestic  textile  industry  and  jobs,  the  Administration  countered  by  arguing  that 
additional  restrictions  run  counter  to  current  U.S.  efforts  to  reduce  worldwide  trade 
barriers.  Lawmakers  speaking  out  against  the  bill  claimed  that  the  legislation  could 
cost  U.S.  consumers  $5  billion  in  increased  clothing  costs  over  the  next  5  years  and 
could  invite  retaliation  from  major  markets  for  U.S.  cotton. 

Romania  Buying 

EC  Wheat 

Romania  has  reportedly  been  offered  credit  by  COFACE  (France’s  export  credit  agen¬ 
cy)  to  cover  the  purchase  of  50,000-100.000  tons  of  French  wheat,  which  will  probably 
be  used  for  feed  purposes.  Major  structural  and  market  changes  are  creating  feedgrain 
shortages  for  the  large  industrial  animal  units  as  private  crops  are  retained  on  farms. 
Romania  is  normally  a  small  wheat  exporter,  and  despite  successively  smaller  harvests, 
has  not  imported  wheat  in  6  years.

India  Resumes  Exports  of 
Wheat  and  Rice 

According  to  trade  sources  in  New  Delhi,  the  Government  of  India  sold  100,000  tons  of 
wheat  to  Jordan  in  a  barter  arrangement  for  November-March  shipment.  This  is  India’s 
biggest  sale  in  3  years.  India  has  re-entered  the  export  market  after  a  2-year  absence. 
In  1988/89,  India  imported  nearly  2  million  tons  of  wheat. 

Turkey  Increases 

Cigarette  Prices 

Ttirkey  recently  increased  cigarette  prices.  The  price  of  TEKELs  (the  Turkish  state 
monopoly)  products  rose  between  14  and  25  percent.  However,  the  price  of  the  least 
expensive  cigarette  was  unchanged  at  $0.11  per  pack.  TEKEL’s  new  oriental  cigarette, 
Izmir,  maintained  its  price  of  $0.74  per  pack.  The  popular  American  blend  cigarette, 
TEKEL  2000,  jumped  to  $1.18  per  pack.  Imported  cigarettes  rose  almost  22  percent  to 
$1.66  per  pack.  The  price  increase  may  weaken  the  demand  for  U.S.  imported  cigaret¬ 
tes  because  smokers  can  trade  down  to  a  domestic  American  blend  cigarette,  such  as 
TEKEL  2000.  Additional  sales  of  TEKEL  2000  would  increase  the  demand  for  U.S. 
leaf  tobacco.  The  United  States  sold  Ttirkey  over  $17  million  of  unmanufactured  tobac¬ 
co,  and  close  to  $200  million  of  cigarettes  last  year. 

Fiscal  1991  GSM-102 

Credit  Guarantee 

Programs  Are  Underway 

With  the  onset  of  fiscal  1991,  USDA  announced  several  GSM-102  Credit  Guarantee 
Programs.  On  September  20,  Ecuador  received  $100  million  in  GSM-102  coverage, 
primarily  for  wheat,  cotton,  tallow  and/or  greases,  and  vegetable  oils.  A  GSM- 102  pro¬ 
gram  for  Colombia  was  announced  on  September  24  for  $60  million,  mainly  for  wheat 
and  tallow  and/or  greases.  On  the  same  day,  a  $200-million  GSM-102  program  covering 
feed  grains,  pulses,  wheat,  oilseeds,  protein  meals,  vegetable  oils,  seed  potatoes,  and 
planting  seeds  was  announced  for  Venezuela.  Of  this  amount,  $100  million  is  operation¬ 
al.  On  September  25,  Chile  received  $50  million  in  GSM-102  coverage  for  wheat  and/or 
wheat  flour  and  feed  grains.  Also  on  September  25,  a  GSM- 102  program  for  El  Sal¬ 
vador  was  announced  for  $25  million,  primarily  for  protein  meals,  tallow  and/or  greases, 
and  vegetable  oils. 

In  October,  USDA  announced  a  $20-million  GSM-102  program  for  Hungary  providing 
$8  million  for  rice,  $5  million  for  vegetable  protein  meals,  $3  million  for  cotton,  $2  mil¬ 
lion  for  breeder  livestock,  and  $2  million  for  leather.  A  GSM-102  program  totaling 
$40  million  for  Yugoslavia  was  announced.  This  program  covers  cotton,  oilseeds, 
protein  meals,  wheat,  hides  and  skins,  solid  wood  products,  and  pulses.  USDA  an¬ 
nounced  a  $25-million  GSM-102  program  for  Guatemala  that  covers  sales  of  wheat 
and/or  wheat  flour,  feed  grains,  rice,  tallow  and/or  greases,  vegetable  oils,  protein 
meals,  pulses,  and  poultry  breeder  stock.  Morocco’s  GSM-102  and  GSM-103  Credit 
Guarantee  Programs  were  also  announced.  GSM-102  coverage  totals  $32  million,  with 
$10  million  for  wheat,  $8  million  for  rice,  and  $14  million  to  be  assigned  to  private 
sector  commodities  at  a  later  date.  Morocco’s  GSM-103  program  totals  $98  million 
with  $58  million  available  for  wheat  (plus  an  additional  $25  million  to  be  made  opera¬ 
tional  at  a  later  date)  and  $15  million  for  feed  grains. 

Sierra  Leone  Increases 

And  Extends  Fiscal  1990 
P.L.  480,  Title  I  Agreement 

Sierra  Leone  signed  a  $5-million  amendment  to  its  fiscal  1990  P.L.  480,  Title  I  agree¬ 
ment.  This  amendment  extends  the  agreement  through  fiscal  1991,  and  provides  an 
additional  $2  million  worth  of  U.S.  wheat  and  $3  million  worth  of  U.S.  rice.  The 
cumulative  program  for  fiscal  1990  and  1991  provides  $3  million  of  wheat  and  $6  million 
of  rice.
