FRICTIONAL  IGNITION  WITH  COAL  MINING  BITS 

By  Welby  G.  Courtney1 


ABSTRACT 

This  publication  reviews  recent  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  studies  of  frictional  ignition  of  a  methane-air 
environment  by  coal  mining  bits  cutting  into  sandstone  and  the  effectiveness  of  remedial  techniques  to 
reduce  the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition.  Frictional  ignition  with  a  mining  bit  always  involves  a  worn 
bit  having  a  wear  flat  on  the  tip  of  the  bit.  The  worn  bit  forms  hot  spots  on  the  surface  of  the  sandstone 
because  of  frictional  abrasion.  The  hot  spots  then  can  ignite  the  methane-air  environment.  A  small 
wear  flat  forms  a  small  hot  spot,  which  does  not  give  ignition,  while  a  large  wear  flat  forms  a  large  hot 
spot,  which  gives  ignition. 

The  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  can  be  somewhat  reduced  by  using  a  mushroom-shaped  tungsten- 
carbide  bit  tip  on  the  mining  bit  and  by  increasing  the  bit  clearance  angle;  it  can  be  significantly  reduced 
by  using  a  water  spray  nozzle  in  back  of  each  bit,  which  is  carefully  oriented  to  direct  the  water  spray 
onto  the  sandstone  surface  directly  behind  the  bit  and  thereby  cool  the  hot  spots  formed  by  the  worn 
bit.  A  bit  replacement  schedule  must  be  used  to  avoid  the  formation  of  a  dangerously  worn  bit.

INTRODUCTION 


The  frictional  use  of  quartzitic  and  pyritic  materials  to 
make  fire  was  known  to  Neanderthalers  (I),2  and  frictional 
ignition  has  been  called  "about  the  second  oldest  profes- 
sion" (2).  Frictional  ignition  of  a  violent  coal  mine  ex- 
plosion such  as  shown  in  figure  1  was  reported  in  1675  (i). 

Field  reports  by  the  Mine  Safety  and  Health  Ad- 
ministration (MSHA)  have  indicated  a  general  increase  in 
the  frequency  of  frictional  ignitions  in  U.S.  coal  mines 
during  the  past  years  (fig.  2).  While  no  miners  have  been 
killed  in  the  United  States  because  of  frictional  ignition 
since  the  early  1970's,  injuries  have  occurred.  The  coal 
mine  explosion  in  Nova  Scotia  in  1979  that  led  to  14  fa- 
talities was  caused  by  a  frictional  ignition  with  the  shearer 
drum  shown  in  figure  3  (5).  The  increase  in  frictional 
ignitions  in  the  United  States  thus  is  alarming. 

The  MSHA  field  reports  indicate  that  frictional  ig- 
nitions in  the  United  States  almost  always  involve  a  metal 
bit  cutting  into  sandstone.3  Field  samples  of  sandstone 
involved  in  frictional  ignitions  in  Great  Britain  indicated 
that  the  sandstone  must  contain  at  least  20  pet  quartz  and 
usually  contains  40  pet  or  more  quartz  (5).  Early  studies 
of  frictional  ignition  reviewed  in  1969  by  Powell  (6) 
indicated  that  frictional  ignition  with  a  metal  bit  cutting 
sandstone  (1)  involved  a  luminous  hot  streak  that  formed 
on  the  surface  of  the  sandstone  because  of  abrasion  by  the 

2Italic  numbers  in  parentheses  refer  to  items  in  the  list  of  references 
at  the  end  of  this  report. 

Very  occasionally  frictional  ignitions  have  appeared  to  involve  a  bit 
cutting  into  pyritic  material.  Also,  a  few  incidents  have  involved 
sandstone-sandstone  abrasion  during  the  fall  of  a  sandstone  roof,  a 
hand  pick  striking  sandstone,  and  a  drill  bit  striking  sandstone  or  steel. 
One  possible  exception  involved  the  cutting  of  "hard  coal"  (4).

(2)  always  involved  a  worn  bit  that  had  formed  a  wear  flat 
on  the  tip  of  the  bit  and  was  never  obtained  with  a  new, 
sharp  bit,  (3)  could  be  obtained  with  almost  any  abrading 
material  but  was,  e.g.,  much  easier  to  obtain  with  steel 
than  with  a  tungsten-carbide  cermet  (9),  and  (4)  was 
apparently  less  likely  to  occur  with  a  lower  bit  veloc- 
ity (5,  9-10).  Figure  4  shows  the  hot  streak  formed  on  the 

4Ignition  by  sparks  can  occur  when  the  sparks  adhere  to  a  surface. 
However,  references  7  and  8,  e.g.,  conclude  that  ignition  can  be 
obtained  with  airborne,  moving  sparks.

All  mining  bits  presently  use  tungsten-carbide  tips  to 
reduce  bit  wear,  but  the  carbide  tips  usually  are  small. 
The  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  (11)  designed  large  mushroom- 
shaped  carbide  tips  for  conical  bits  and  dovetail-shaped 
carbide  tips  for  rectangular  (radial)  bits  to  physically 
protect  the  steel  shank  and  thereby  reduce  the  likelihood 
of  frictional  ignition  due  to  abrasion  by  the  incendive  steel 
shank.  Figure  5  shows  conventional-  and  mushroom- 
tipped  conical  bits.  Figure  6  shows  conventional  plug-  and 
peak-tipped  rectangular  bits  and  a  mushroom-type 
dovetail-tipped  bit.  Laboratory  tests  indicated  that  the 
mushroom-  and  dovetail-tipped  bits  had  longer  wear  lives 
than  the  conventional-tipped  bits  before  the  incendive  steel 
shank  became  exposed  (12).  An  in-mine  test  with  conical 
bits  supported  these  laboratory  conclusions  (13). 

Bureau  tests  have  indicated,  however,  that  frictional 
ignition  can  eventually  be  obtained  with  the  wear  flat 
formed  on  the  tungsten-carbide  tip  of  a  nonrotating 
(frozen)  conical  bit  without  exposure  of  the  steel  shank. 
The  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  was  significantly 
reduced  with  an  increased  initial  bit  clearance  angle  9C,

e.g.,  with  conical  bits,  with  an  increased  initial  bit  attack 
angle  9A  and/or  a  decreased  internal  bit  tip  angle  0T  as 
shown  in  figure  7,  where  6A  is  the  angle  between  the  bit 
axis  and  the  sandstone  surface  and  6C  =  0A  -  6T/2  (14). 
Figure  8  shows  that  the  number  of  cuts  to  give  ignition 
with  a  new,  tungsten-carbide-tipped,  frozen  conical  bit 
cutting  into  a  sandstone  block  increased  by  a  factor  of

about  3  if  6A  increased  by  10°  or  0T  decreased  by  10°.  An 
in-mine  test  by  Jim  Walter  Resources  (JWR)  (15)  support- 
ed these  laboratory  conclusions.  In  a  section  prone  to  fric- 
tional ignitions  because  of  a  sandstone  parting,  no  ignitions 
occurred  in  mining  50,000  tons  of  coal  with  mushroom  bits 
having  a  Bureau-recommended  bit  attack  angle  of  57°, 
while  two  ignitions  then  occurred  in  mining  10,000  tons 
using  conventional-tipped  bits  having  the  normal  mine  at- 
tack angle  of  50°. 

While  both  of  these  features  (mushroom  tip  and  in- 
creased bit  clearance  angle)  are  valuable  in  reducing  the 
early  ignition  hazard  associated  with  conical  bits,  both  fea- 
tures merely  postpone  the  time  when  the  bits  have  been 
worn  to  a  dangerous  condition  likely  to  cause  frictional 
ignition.  A  replacement  schedule  for  worn  bits  is  there- 
fore required.  E.g.,  the  bits  in  the  JWR  field  test  (15) 
were  replaced  after  every  shuttle  car  was  loaded  if  the 
mining  machine  was  cutting  into  a  sandstone  parting. 

Other  laboratory  studies  (16-17)  have  indicated  that  a 
solid-cone  water  spray  impacting  onto  the  surface  of  the 
freshly  cut  sandstone  directly  in  back  of  the  cutter  bit  very 
significantly  reduced  the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition, 
even  with  very  worn  bits,  by  promptly  cooling  the  hot 
streak  formed  by  the  worn  bit  cutting  the  sandstone.  The 
water  requirement  to  reduce  ignition  was  about  0.5  gpm 
for  each  bit  and  thus  was  somewhat  high  but  not  excessive. 


the  use  of  water  that  impinges  onto  the  front  of  the  bit  to 
reduce  airborne  respirable  dust  has  become  a  standard 
mining  practice  in  Great  Britain.  However,  laboratory 
tests  indicate  that  it  had  negligible  effect  in  reducing 
frictional  ignition  (18). 

As  part  of  its  program  to  enhance  the  safety  of  workers 
in  the  mining  industry,  the  Bureau  has  studied  the  problem 
of  frictional  ignition  and  especially  the  use  of  water  sprays 
in  back  of  the  cutter  bits  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of 
frictional  ignition.  This  report  reviews  several  Bureau- 
funded  studies  conducted  from  1979  to  1988.  A  detailed 
laboratory  study  with  a  rectangular  bit  and  several  types  of 
water  sprays  was  conducted  by  Bituminous  Coal  Research 
(now,  Bituminous  Coal  Research  National  Laboratory 
(BCRNL))  from  1979  to  1981  under  Bureau  contract  (18). 


In-house  Bureau  studies  of  a  second  back  spray  and 
rectangular  bit  system  and  a  back  spray  and  conical  bit 
system  were  conducted  in  1983.  and  a  study  of  a  front 
spray  and  conical  bit  system  was  conducted  in  1987.  Brief 
Bureau  studies  of  several  commercial  back-spray  systems 
with  rectangular  and  conical  bits  were  conducted  in  1983 
and  1987.  Results  of  these  studies  have  not  been 
previously  published.  A  field  test  with  back  sprays  and 
conical  bits  on  a  wet-head-modified  cutter  drum  on  a 
Simmons  Rand  2655  continuous  mining  machine  was  com- 
pleted in  late  1988.  These  studies  generally  had  a  practical 
orientation.  Recent  Bureau  work  having  a  more  funda- 
mental orientation  is  briefly  presented  in  the  "Discussion" 
section. 


EXPERIMENTAL  TECHNIQUE 


Previous  laboratory  techniques  to  investigate  frictional 
ignition  have  involved  (1)  a  worn  field  bit  making  a  single 
centimeter-deep  spiral  cut  into  new  locations  on  a  rotating 
block  of  sandstone  (5),  (2)  a  metal  tool  (9)  or  a  worn 
rectangular  field  bit  (10)  making  multiple  shallow  cuts  at 
the  same  location  on  a  stationary  sandstone  block,  and  (3) 
miscellaneous  techniques  such  as  a  metal  tool  held  against 
a  grinding  wheel,  drill  bit,  falling  weight,  hand  pick,  and 
high-speed  projectile  (6). 

The  miscellaneous  techniques  were  used  mainly  to  indi- 
cate qualitatively  whether  frictional  ignition  could  occur. 
Techniques  1  and  2  were  used  mainly  to  indicate  the 
effectiveness  of  a  remedial  technique  in  reducing  the 
likelihood  of  frictional  ignition.  E.g.,  in  investigating  the 
effect  of  bit  velocity,  a  worn  bit  making  a  deep  spiral  cut 
in  a  sandstone  block  (5)  gave  ignition  in  3  s  with  a  bit 
velocity  of  150  cm/s  and  0.3  s  with  a  bit  velocity  of 
450  cm/s.  The  metal  tool  making  multiple  shallow  cuts  at 
the  same  location  in  a  sandstone  block  (9)  gave  ignition 
with  about  175  cuts  with  a  tool  velocity  of  150  cm/s  and 
75  cuts  with  a  tool  velocity  of  450  cm/s.  The  worn  bit 
making  multiple  shallow  cuts  at  the  same  location  (10) 
gave  ignition  with  about  350  and  240  cuts  with  bit  velocities 
of  100  and  280  cm/s,  respectively.  The  investigators  re- 
commended that  a  lower  bit  velocity  be  used  to  reduce 
the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition. 

However,  the  relationship  between  these  cutting 
techniques  and  field  cutting  is  not  clear.  It  was  thought 
advisable  to  simulate  field  cutting  insofar  as  reasonably 
possible.  A  new  laboratory  frictional  ignition  apparatus 
was  developed  by  BCRNL  (18).  A  single  field  bit  was 
mounted  onto  a  field  cutter  drum  rotating  downward  in 
the  vertical  plane  at  a  typical  field  drum  rotation  speed. 
A  51-cm-high  block  of  sandstone  containing  78  pet  quartz 
(from  Cleveland  Quarries,  Berea,  OH)  was  positioned  on 
a  cart,  with  the  bedding  plane  horizontal,  and  was  moved 
horizontally  across  the  rotating  drum.  A  series  of  slanted 
downward  cuts  thus  were  made  in  new  parts  of  the  sand- 
stone block.  The  block  was  precut  to  excavate  the  circular 
arc  in  the  block  and  was  positioned  so  that  a  0.6-cm-deep 


cut  was  made  by  the  bit  along  the  entire  length  of  the  arc. 
The  block  and  drum  were  enclosed  in  a  plywood  chamber 
containing  a  7-pct  methane-air  environment.  The  chamber 
included  plastic  blowout  panels  to  relieve  the  chamber 
pressure  when  ignition  occurred.  Figure  9  shows  the  igni- 
tion chamber. 

The  number  of  cuts  made  by  the  bit  to  ignite  the 
methane-air  environment  was  counted.  The  number  of 
cuts  during  1  pass  of  the  block  depended  upon  the  cart 
speed  and  drum  rotation  speed  and  usually  was  about  20. 
If  no  ignition  occurred  during  passage  of  the  block,  the 
block  usually  was  redressed,  repositioned,  and  again  pass- 
ed across  the  rotating  drum.  The  total  number  of  cuts 
to  obtain  ignition  was  taken  as  a  measure  of  the  ease  of

ignition.  The  number  of  cuts  to  obtain  ignition  when  a 
remedial  technique  was  used,  such  as  a  lesser  drum 
rotation  speed  or  a  water  spray,  then  was  measured.  The 
increase  in  the  number  of  cuts  required  to  obtain  ignition 
with  the  remedial  technique  was  taken  as  a  measure  of  the 
effectiveness  of  the  remedial  technique. 

The  present  cutting  technique  is  similar  to  the  tech- 
nique reported  later  in  reference  19,  in  which  multiple 
deep  cuts  with  a  worn  field  bit  mounted  on  a  field  shearer 
drum  rotating  at  a  field  speed  were  made  in  a  sandstone 
block  being  moved  horizontally  below  the  drum. 


The  initial  laboratory  study  described  below  used  a  wet- 
head  shearer  drum  fabricated  for  a  Joy  Technologies,  Inc., 
ILS  shearer.  Subsequent  laboratory  studies  used  a  seg- 
ment of  the  cutter  drum  from  a  used  Joy  12  ripper-type 
continuous  mining  machine,  which  was  modified  here  to  be 
a  wet  head  by  using  a  small-diameter  water  seal  attached 
to  the  end  of  the  drum  shaft.  The  field  study  used  a  wet- 
head  cutter  drum  on  a  Simmons  Rand  265  ripper  machine 
that  was  designed  and  fabricated  by  Simmons  Rand  and 
used  large-diameter  water  seals  from  Cannings  Seals  in 
Great  Britain. 


RESULTS 


Six  laboratory  studies  with  water  sprays  were  conducted, 
four  with  different  rectangular  bits  and  two  with  different 
conical  bits.  A  third  study  with  conical  bits  and  back 
sprays  mounted  on  the  wet-head  Simmons  Rand  265  con- 
tinuous mining  machine  was  conducted  in  the  field.

In  1979,  the  Bureau  initiated  a  contract  with  BCRNL 
(18)  (1)  to  conduct  a  laboratory  study  of  frictional  ignition 
and  especially  the  effectiveness  of  water  sprays  in  reducing 
the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  with  rectangular  cutting 
bits  on  a  shearer  drum  and  (2)  to  initiate  and  monitor  a 
subsequent  field  study.  A  76-cm-wide  wet-head  cutter 
drum  for  a  Joy  ILS  shearer  expected  to  be  available  for 
laboratory  tests  at  the  Bureau's  Bruceton  facility  was 
designed  by  BCRNL  and  AMS  Technology  and  fabricated 
by  AMS.  The  drum  used  43  bits  and  a  tight  lacing  pat- 
tern (fig.  10)  designed  for  difficult  cutting  conditions. 
Scheduling  difficulties  prevented  use  of  the  Joy  ILS  shearer 
at  Bruceton,  so  the  test  chamber  described  earlier  was 
used  with  the  ILS  drum. 

Kennametal,  Inc.,  K-100  bits  having  a  2.5-cm-wide  tip 
were  used  here.  Figure  11  shows  the  side  view  of  the 
K-100  bit.  The  bit  had  the  conventional,  peak-shaped, 
tungsten-carbide  and  cobalt  cermet  tip  and  a  shank  made 
of  AISI  Type  4140  steel.  New  bits  and  bits  that  had  been 
shortened  by  0.04  to  0.56  cm  and  ground  flat  to  simulate 
a  worn  field  bit  were  used.  Bit  wear  during  a  test  was 
negligible.  The  tip-to-tip  diameter  was  137  cm.  A  drum 
speed  of  47  rpm  was  used  in  most  of  this  study,  giving  a 
tip  velocity  of  337  cm/s.  A  cart  speed  of  41  cm/min  was 
usually  used,  giving  about  60  cuts  during  1  pass  of  the 
51  cm-wide  sandstone  block,  with  one-third  of  the  2.5-cm- 
wide  bit  tip  cutting  into  fresh  sandstone  and  two-thirds 
of  the  tip  abrading  the  previously  cut  portion  of  the 
sandstone. 

Initial  work  used  a  single  bit.  The  hot  streak  formed  on 
the  surface  of  the  sandstone  by  a  worn  K-100  bit  cutting 


into  the  sandstone  block  was  shown  in  figure  4.  Airborne 
hot  sparks  were  also  formed,  but  motion  picture  and  video

photography  indicated  that  ignition,  with  one  exception,6 
occurred  at  the  bottom  part  of  the  hot  streak. 

The  number  of  cuts  to  give  frictional  ignition  depended 
upon  the  amount  of  wear  of  the  bit  tip.  The  average  num- 
ber of  cuts  to  obtain  ignition  with  worn  bits  is  given  in 
table  1  and  shown  in  figure  12.  Raw  data  are  given  in  the 
footnotes  in  table  1.  Results  were  rather  scattered.  Data 
considered  to  be  probable  "outliers"  due  to  cutting  into 
damp  sandstone  (see  section  on  GTE  bits)  are  enclosed 
in  brackets  in  table  1  and  were  ignored  in  calculating  the 
average  number  of  strikes.  Excluding  outliers,  the  results 
still  had  considerable  scatter;  i.e.,  the  coefficients  of 
variation  of  the  sets  of  data  in  the  footnotes  of  table  1  and 
also  other  sets  of  data  presented  later  in  this  report  ranged 
from  25  to  80  pet.

No  ignition  was  obtained  with  217  dry  cuts  with  a  new 
bit  or  293  cuts  with  a  0.08-cm-worn  bit.  Ignition  was 
obtained  with  a  slightly  more  worn  bit,  e.g.,  with  an  aver- 
age of  45  dry  cuts  with  a  0.16-cm-worn  bit  and  5.8  dry  cuts 
with  a  0.27-cm-worn  bit.  The  steel  shank,  which  became 
exposed  when  the  bit  was  worn  0.14  cm,  presumably  was 
the  major  contributor  to  ignition.  The  physical  differ- 
ence between  a  "safe"  0.08-cm-worn  bit  and  a  "dangerous" 
0.27-cm-worn  bit  was  only  barely  discernible  in  the 
laboratory,  and  a  bit  replacement  schedule  in  the  field 
probably  could  not  be  based  on  visual  observation  of  the 
extent  of  bit  wear  or  exposure  of  the  steel  shank. 

The  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  with  a  worn  bit  was 
not  decreased  with  a  lower  drum  rotation  speed  in  the 

^n  one  test,  ignition  occurred  below  the  block  and  presumably  was 
due  to  the  hot  sparks  adhering  to  the  floor  of  the  chamber.

tained with  a  0.45-cm-worn  bit  during  dry  cutting  are  given 
in  table  2  and  plotted  in  figure  13.  Ignition  was  obtained 
with  about  the  same  number  of  cuts  when  the  drum  was 
operated  with  a  bit  velocity  of  108  or  337  cm/s  (15  or 
47  rpm).  The  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  did  rapidly 
decrease  (the  number  of  cuts  for  ignition  rapidly 
increased)  with  a  still  lower  drum  speed,  but  such  a  low 
drum  speed  may  be  impractical  for  underground  mining.

The  effect  of  water  sprays  from  various  water  spray 
nozzles  mounted  in  front  or  in  back  of  a  worn  bit  was 
investigated.  With  a  water  jet  impinging  onto  the  front  of 
a  0.32-cm-worn  bit,  a  0.2-gpm  jet  was  ineffective  in 
preventing  ignition;  i.e.,  ignition  occurred  with  nine  cuts 
during  wet  operation  versus  seven  dry  cuts  (table  1).  A 
1.1-gpm  front  jet  was  more  effective,  in  that  ignition 
occurred  with  69  wet  cuts  versus  seven  dry  cuts. 

A  back-mounted  spray  nozzle  whose  spray  impacted  the 
back  of  a  0.48-cm-worn  bit  was  not  very  effective.   With

a  water  jet,  ignition  was  obtained  with  10  wet  cuts,  while 
ignition  was  obtained  with  an  average  of  3.6  dry  cuts  (ta- 
ble 1).  A  fan-type  spray  (Spraying  Systems  Co.  W1502) 
was  effective  when  the  fan  spray  nozzle  was  operated  at 
100  psig  because  the  spray  splashed  off  the  back  of  the  bit 
and  impacted  the  sandstone  surface  within  about  5  cm 
behind  the  leading  edge  of  the  tip  of  the  bit.  However,  the 
fan  spray  was  ineffective  if  the  nozzle  was  operated  at 
140  psig  because  the  splash  impact  zone  then  was  further 
behind  the  bit;  i.e.,  impacting  the  hot  streak  with  the  water 
spray  within  about  5  cm  behind  the  bit  tip  appeared  to  be 
required  to  avoid  ignition.  A  solid-cone  spray  that  im- 
pinged onto  the  back  of  the  bit  similarly  gave  only  a 
modest  anti-ignition  benefit;  i.e.,  ignition  occurred  with 
13  wet  cuts  compared  with  3.6  dry  cuts. 

A  fan  spray  impinging  the  freshly  cut  sandstone  surface 
directly  behind  the  bit,  with  the  fan  oriented  parallel  to 
and  directed  onto  the  bit  path,  was  somewhat  effective. 
E.g.,  a  0.3-gpm  fan  spray  did  not  permit  ignition  with  a 
0.48-cm-worn  bit  with  120  wet  cuts,  while  ignition  was 
obtained  with  3.6  dry  cuts.  However,  ignition  was  obtained 
with  90  wet  cuts  with  a  0.80-cm-worn  bit.  Also,  the  fan 
spray  was  ineffective  when  oriented  perpendicular  to  the 
bit  path.  Since  the  fan  spray  appeared  to  be  of  only 
modest  benefit  with  a  very  worn  bit  and  especially  since 
maintenance  of  a  parallel  orientation  in  the  field  was 
expected  to  be  difficult  because  of  nozzle  misorientation, 
no  additional  work  was  done  with  fan  sprays. 

A  cone  spray  was  selected  for  further  work  to  avoid  the 
nozzle  orientation  problem.  A  solid-cone  spray  was  pre- 
ferred to  a  hollow-cone  spray  in  order  to  give  better 
cooling  of  the  hot  streak;  i.e.,  the  solid  circle  of  drops  at 
the  impaction  plane  obtained  with  a  solid-cone  spray  was 
expected  to  give  better  cooling  than  the  annular  ring  of 
drops  obtained  with  a  hollow-cone  spray.  Spray  nozzles 
giving  a  mean  number  drop  size  of  about  200  /jm,  con- 
sidered to  be  optimum  for  impaction  coverage  of  a  target 
surface  (20),  were  chosen.  Only  Spraying  Systems  nozzles 


GG3004 
nozzle 


Figure  14.- Anti-ignition  back-spray  and  bit  geometry  with 
Kennametal  K-100  bit 


were  considered  in  this  study  since  the  manufacturer 
provided  information  on  mean  drop  size.  The  Spraying 
Systems  nozzles  considered  included  the  GG3  nozzle,  with 
an  internal  spray  angle  of  60°  (0.9  gpm  at  100  psig)  and 
the  GG3004  nozzle,  with  an  internal  spray  angle  of  30° 
(0.5  gpm  at  100  psig). 

The  GG3  spray  at  70  psig  did  not  give  ignition  with 
115  wet  cuts  with  a  very  worn  bit,  while  ignition  occurred 
with  an  average  of  3.6  dry  cuts.  Water  consumption  was 
0.7  gpm  and  thus  somewhat  high.  The  GG3004  nozzle  was 
selected  for  detailed  work  since  it  involved  a  lesser  water- 
flow  rate  and  was  considered  to  be  more  practical  for  field 
mining  operations.  Also,  a  spray  with  a  30°  internal  angle 
gives  a  greater  water  density  (e.g.,  gallon  per  minute  per 
square  centimeter)  at  the  impaction  plane  on  the  sand- 
stone surface  than  a  60°  spray  with  a  similar  flow  rate  and 
thus  should  give  better  cooling  of  the  hot  streak. 

The  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  with  a  very  worn  bit 
was  significantly  reduced  when  the  spray  from  the  GG3004 
nozzle  located  13  cm  behind  the  bit  tip  impinged  onto  the 
freshly  cut  sandstone  surface  directly  in  back  of  the  bit. 
Figure  14  shows  the  spray-bit  geometry  used  here,  with  the 
spray  nozzle  oriented  50°  to  the  surface  of  the  drum.  At 
the  impaction  plane,  the  spray  had  a  diameter  of  about 
6.4  cm  and  an  area  of  33  cm2.  Impingement  of  about 
10  pet  of  the  spray  water  onto  the  back  of  the  bit  was 
purposely  selected  here  in  the  event  that  a  smaller  bit  may 
be  used  in  the  field.  The  spray  nozzle  was  recessed  in  a 
steel  housing  to  protect  the  nozzle  from  damage  by  broken 
coal. 

Laboratory  results  with  a  GG3004  nozzle,  showing  the 
effect  of  waterflow  rate  and  pressure  on  the  number  of 


cuts  to  give  ignition  with  worn  bits,  are  given  in  table  3. 
Ignition  did  not  occur  with  100+  wet  cuts  using  0.4  to 
0.6  gpm  (70  to  110  psig).  Figure  15  shows  the  effect  of  the 
back  spray  on  cooling  the  hot  streak  and  is  to  be  com- 
pared with  figure  4.  The  hot  streak  extended  about  2  cm 
behind  the  bit  and  thus  existed  for  about  7  ms  before  be- 
ing cooled  by  the  back  spray.  Ignition  did  occur  in  four 
out  of  six  tests  (table  3,  footnote  4)  when  the  nozzle  pres- 
sure was  40  psig  (0.3  gpm),  but  this  low-pressure  spray 
was  poorly  formed  and  gave  a  poor  impingement  pattern 
on  the  sandstone  surface.

The  above  tests  used  a  single  bit.  With  a  fully  laced 
drum,  broken  coal  from  nearby  bits  may  interfere  with  the 
spray  pattern  and  reduce  the  anti-ignition  effectiveness  of 
the  back  spray.  This  aspect  was  investigated  using  the 
drum  fully  laced  with  43  bits  making  a  sump-type  cut  into 
a  152-cm-high,  152-cm-long,  76-cm-wide  block  of  artificial 


coal  containing  a  51-cm-high,  76-cm-long,  76-cm-wide 
sandstone  slab  in  the  bottom  part  of  the  block  (fig.  16).  A 
GG3004  spray  nozzle  was  located  behind  each  of  the 
43  bits  as  shown  in  figure  14.  Figure  17  shows  several  of 
the  bits  with  their  back  sprays.  Total  water  consumption 
was  22  gpm  when  the  43  sprays  were  operated  at  100  psig. 
Bits  worn  0.54  cm  were  used  to  subject  the  anti-ignition 
back  sprays  to  a  severe  test.  The  drum  and  block  were 
again  enclosed  in  a  wooden  box  containing  a  7-pct 
methane-air  mixture.  The  drum  was  operated  at  47  rpm. 
Depth  of  cut  usually  was  0.079  cm/r.  The  time  to  give  ig- 
nition was  taken  as  a  measure  of  the  ease  of  ignition.

No  ignition  occurred  during  50  s  of  dry  cutting  into  the 
artificial  coal  part  of  the  block.  Results  obtained  with  the 
drum  cutting  into  the  sandstone  part  of  the  block  are  given 
in  table  4.  Raw  data  are  again  given  in  the  footnotes,  with 
tests  considered  to  be  outliers  given  in  brackets.  The 
17  "dry"  tests  in  brackets  in  footnote  1  were  conducted 
shortly  after  a  wet  test  and  thus  involved  cutting  into  damp 
sandstone.  The  bracketed  test  in  footnote  3  involved  bits 
that  were  severely  worn  on  their  sides  because  of  abrasion 
of  the  bit  on  the  side  of  the  sandstone  slab;  this  test  was 
considered  to  be  an  outlier  since  the  back  spray  would  not 
impact  and  cool  the  hot  streak  formed  on  the  side  of  the 
sandstone  slab.

Ignition  occurred  with  an  average  of  13  s  during  dry 
cutting  into  the  sandstone  slab.  Ignition  was  not  observed 
in  54+  s  during  wet  cutting  if  the  water  pressure  was 
60  psig  or  higher.  Ignition  was  observed  in  53  s  when  the 
water  pressure  was  reduced  to  40  psig. 

No  ignition  occurred  (>65  s)  when  four  adjacent  spray 
nozzles  were  plugged,  indicating  that  a  back  spray  provided 
considerable  anti-ignition  protection  in  cooling  the  hot 
streaks  formed  by  nearby  bits  whose  spray  nozzles  became 
clogged.  When  nine  adjacent  spray  nozzles  were  plugged, 
no  ignition  occurred  in  five  of  six  tests  (averaging  >75  s), 
again  indicating  the  considerable  protection  provided  by  a 
back  spray  to  nearby  bits. 

The  depth  of  cut  did  not  appear  to  be  significant,  in 
that  ignition  was  also  obtained  in  13  s  of  dry  cutting  when 
the  depth  of  cut  was  0.19  cm/r. 

Since  47  rpm  corresponds  to  0.8  rps,  a  13-s  test 
corresponds  to  10  cuts  by  a  bit.  These  multibit  results  may 
be  compared  with  the  earlier  single-bit  results,  which  gave 
ignition  with  2.2  dry  cuts,   and  suggest  that   frictional 


ignition  is  less  likely  with  a  multibit  system.  However,  the 
anti-ignition  protection  provided  by  back  sprays  with  both 
systems  appears  to  be  very  significant.  Briefly  summarized, 
the  BCRNL  results  were— 

1.  In  dry  cutting, 

a.  No  frictional  ignition  occurred  using  new  or 
slightly  worn  bits  but  ignition  readily  occurred  with  a  few 
cuts  using  slightly  more  worn  bits; 

b.  Decreased  bit  velocity  (in  the  range  considered 
to  be  of  practical  interest)  had  negligible  effect  on  reduc- 
ing the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  using  very  worn  bits. 

2.  In  wet  cutting  with  very  worn  bits, 

a.  Frictional  ignition  readily  occurred  when  the  wa- 
ter spray  impinged  onto  the  bit; 

b.  The  likelihood  of  ignition  was  significantly  re- 
duced if  the  spray  from  a  Spraying  Systems  GG3004  nozzle 
impinged  onto  the  freshly  cut  sandstone  surface  directly 
behind  the  bit  when  the  nozzle  was  operated  at  80  to 
240  psig  (0.47  to  0.82  gpm),  but  ignition  occurred  when  the 
nozzle  was  operated  at  40  psig; 

c.  The  broken  coal  did  not  significantly  interfere 
with  the  anti-ignition  effectiveness  of  the  back  spray, 

d.  No  ignition  occurred  when  four  adjacent  nozzles 
were  plugged,  and  the  likelihood  of  ignition  was  signifi- 
cantly reduced  when  nine  adjacent  nozzles  were  plugged. 

BCRNL  recommended  that  a  Spraying  System  GG3004 
spray  nozzle  giving  a  solid-cone  spray  be  located  behind 
each  cutter  bit,  be  carefully  oriented  so  that  the  spray 
water  impinged  onto  the  freshly  cut  mineral  surface  directly 
behind  the  bit,  and  be  operated  at  80  to  100  psig  (0.5  gpm) 
at  the  nozzle. 

An  early  field  test  with  an  anti-ignition-modified 
Joy  ILS  drum  using  back  sprays  that  extended  03  cm 
beyond  their  steel  protective  housings  failed  because  of 
breakage  of  the  spray  nozzles.  Field  tests  with  the  anti- 
ignition-modified  Joy  ILS  drum  using  the  recessed  spray 
nozzle  shown  in  figure  14  were  cancelled  because  of  the 
unavailability  of  a  field  shearer. 

Carmet  TC3 

A  mining  company  purchased  anti-ignition  shearer 
drums  with  Carmet  (Allegheny  Ludlum  Industries  Co.) 
TC3  rectangular  bits  and  specified  back-mounted  Senior 
Conflow,  Inc.,  280INC  spray  nozzles  instead  of  the  Spray- 
ing Systems  GG3004  nozzles  because  of  easier  nozzle  re- 
placement. The  280INC  nozzle  gives  a  solid-cone  spray 
having  about  the  same  spray  geometry  and  waterflow  rate 
(0.4  gpm  at  100  psig)  as  the  GG3004  nozzle  and  was  ex- 
pected to  provide  similar  anti-ignition  protection. 

However,  several  frictional  ignitions  occurred  in  the 
field  with  the  anti-ignition-modified  drums.  The  mine  op- 
erator had  experienced  nozzle  clogging  and  had  attempted 
to  avoid  clogging  by  (1)  modifying  half  of  the  280INC 
nozzles  so  that  they  delivered  a  hollow-cone  spray  instead 
of  the  solid-cone  spray  and  (2)  increasing  the  water 
pressure  to  300  psig  instead  of  using  the  80-  to  100-psig 


11 


range  recommended  by  BCRNL.  Furthermore,  the  opera- 
tor planned  to  use  Senior  Conflow  777NC  nozzles 
operated  at  500  psig  in  the  future.  While  the  general  spray 
characteristics  of  the  777NC  nozzle  are  similar  to  those  of 
the  280INC  and  GG3004  nozzles  and  should  provide  simi- 
lar anti-ignition  protection  at  100  psig,  the  anti-ignition 
performance  of  these  nozzles  at  300  and  500  psig  was 
unknown. 

Numerous  in-mine  tests  have  indicated  that  nozzle 
clogging  due  to  dirty  water  entering  the  mining  machine 
can  he  easily  avoided  with  a  Bureau-designed  nonclogging 
system  (21),  which  involves  a  Y-type  strainer,  a  hydro- 
cyclone,  and  a  polishing  filter.  Rust  and  scale  particles 
that  form  in  the  water  channels  inside  the  machine  can  be 
eliminated  with  screens  installed  in  each  spray  nozzle. 
Otherwise,  regarding  modification  1,  the  anti-ignition 
performance  of  a  hollow-cone  spray  had  not  been 
investigated  but  was  expected  to  be  less  than  that  provided 
by  a  solid-cone  spray  because  of  lesser  cooling  of  the  hot 
streak  by  the  annular  drop-impaction  pattern  instead  of  the 
solid-circle  pattern.  Regarding  modification  2,  a  nozzle 
operated  at  high  pressure  tends  to  give  a  fine  mist  instead 
of  the  coarse  spray  obtained  when  the  nozzle  is  operated 
at  lower  pressure.  Misting  is  undesirable  from  an  anti- 
ignition  viewpoint  since  the  small  mist  drops  rapidly  lose 
their  momentum  and  would  be  less  likely  to  impact  the 
sandstone  surface  and  cool  the  hot  streak. 

Laboratory  tests  with  the  Carmet  TC3  bit  were 
conducted  by  the  Bureau  to  investigate  the  anti-ignition 
performance  of  the  280INC  and  777NC  nozzles,  especially 
when  operated  at  high  pressure.  Figure  18  shows  the 
1.3-cm-wide  Carmet  TC3  bit.  TC3  bits  were  shortened  by 
0.32  and  0.43  cm  and  flattened  to  simulate  field  bits  that 
had  become  worn  in  order  to  expose  the  incendive  steel 


Carbide  tip- 


shank  and  subject  the  back  sprays  to  a  severe  test. 
Previous  work  (with  the  GTE  bit  described  later)  had 
indicated  that  ignition  with  sandstone  that  had  been 
dampened  by  a  previous  wet  test  was  more  difficult,  i.e., 
required  more  cuts  for  ignition.  Therefore,  a  sequence  of 
only  two  ignition  tests  were  made  per  day.  The  first  test 
was  conducted  dry  to  confirm  that  the  sandstone  was 
suitably  dry.  The  second  test  was  conducted  wet.  Tests 
were  then  stopped,  and  a  space  heater  was  installed  in  the 
chamber  to  dry  the  sandstone  block  overnight.  A  new  dry- 
wet  sequence  of  two  tests  was  conducted  the  next  day. 

Results  are  given  in  table  5.  Frictional  ignition  with 
the  0.32-cm-worn  TC3  bit  was  obtained  with  an  average  of 
4.0  dry  cuts  but  was  not  obtained  with  about  65  wet  cuts 
using  either  the  280INC  nozzle  operated  at  100,  300,  and 
500  psig  (0.4,  1.1,  and  1.1  gpm)  or  the  777NC  nozzle  op- 
erated at  100  and  300  psig  (0.4  and  0.8  gpm).  However, 
with  the  0.43-cm-worn  bit,  ignition  was  obtained  with 
19  and  9  wet  cuts  when  the  777NC  nozzle  was  operated  at 
100  and  300  psig  and  in  1  of  2  tests  performed  at  500  psig 
versus  the  average  of  2.4  dry  cuts  for  ignition.

As  with  the  Kennametal  K-100  bit,  the  physical  differ- 
ence between  the  "safe"  0.32-cm-worn  bit  and  the  "danger- 
ous" 0.43-cm-worn  bit  when  using  back  sprays  was  barely 
discernible  in  the  laboratory;  e.g.,  the  lengths  of  the  ex- 
posed steel  shanks  were  1.7  and  2.2  cm,  respectively. 

Since  the  areas  of  the  exposed  steel  shanks  of  the  worn 
Carmet  TC3  and  the  Kennametal  K-100  bits  are  com- 
parable and  the  worn  K-100  bit  was  easily  protected  with 
the  Spraying  Systems  GG3004  nozzle  operated  at  0.5  gpm 
and  100  psig,  the  Senior  Conflow  280INC  and  777NC 
sprays  as  used  here  appear  to  be  somewhat  less  protective 
than  the  Spraying  Systems  GG3004  nozzle. 

Operation  of  either  the  280INC  or  777NC  nozzle  at 
300  psig  and  especially  at  500  psig  would  appear  to  offer 


12 


no  anti-ignition  advantage  and  would  definitely  be  dis- 
advantageous in  terms  of  high  waterflow  rate  and  the  usual 
expense  and  inconvenience  of  operating  at  high  water 
pressure. 

It  may  be  that  the  several  field  ignitions  with  the  anti- 
ignition  drums  involved  nozzle  clogging. 

AMS  THRU-FLUSH 

Sometimes  there  may  be  insufficient  physical  space  on 
the  cutter  drum  to  locate  a  spray  nozzle  on  the  drum 
directly  behind  each  bit  as  shown  in  figure  14.  The  back- 
mounted  anti-ignition  spray  nozzles  then  must  be  located 
to  one  side  of  the  bit,  or  some  other  physical  change  in  the 
nozzle-bit  geometry  must  be  considered. 

One  approach  is  to  install  the  spray  nozzle  directly  in 
the  back  part  of  the  bit  shank.  Such  a  bit  is  commercially 
available  from  AMS  Technology  and  is  called  a  THRU- 
FLUSH  bit.  AMS  offers  either  a  slot-type  spray  nozzle, 
which  gives  a  fan  spray  whose  orientation  is  fixed  and 
directed  onto  the  bit  path,  or  a  solid-cone  spray.  AMS 
reported  that  field  tests  indicate  that  the  fan  spray  gives  a 
significant  reduction  in  respirable  dust  compared  with  both 
the  AMS  cone  spray  and  a  conventional  boom-mounted 
water  spray  system. 

The  anti-ignition  performance  of  the  fan-spray  version 
of  the  THRU-FLUSH  bit  was  investigated  in  the  labora- 
tory. In  initial  work,  the  THRU-FLUSH  bit  was  cut  down 
1.3  cm  and  flattened  to  expose  the  steel  shank  behind  the 
carbide  section  in  the  front  part  of  the  bit  tip  but  still 
protect  the  recessed  spray  nozzle,  thereby  simulating  a 
worn  field  bit.  However,  reproducibility  was  poor  because 
the  trailing  steel  section  of  the  flattened  tip  became  worn 
in  an  irregular  manner.  The  front  carbide  section  of  the 
tip  was  cut  down  another  0.6  cm  so  that  only  the  flattened 
steel  shank  was  abrading  the  sandstone  surface.  Figure  19 
shows  the  2.5-cm-wide  THRU-FLUSH  bit  on  the  left  and 
the  modified  bit  used  in  the  present  ignition  tests  on  the 
right.  Figure  20  shows  the  THRU-FLUSH  bit  with  the  fan 
back  spray  operated  at  100  psig.  The  water  density  in  the 
spray  shown  in  figure  20  was  less  near  the  bit  tip  than 
farther  behind  the  tip.  This  spray  inhomogeneity  may  have 
been  due  to  a  faulty  spray  nozzle,  but  this  aspect  was  not 
examined. 

A  38-cm-wide,  51-cm-high  sandstone  block  was  used  in 
these  tests.  The  block  was  moved  at  23  cm/min  across 
the  drum  being  rotated  at  39  rpm,  giving  about  65  cuts 
during  1  pass  of  the  block.  About  one-fourth  of  the  bit  tip 
cut  into  a  fresh  part  of  the  sandstone  block  and  three- 
fourths  of  the  tip  abraded  the  previously  cut  part  of  the 
block. 

Results  are  given  in  table  6.  The  outlier  in  footnote  2 
occurred  when  the  side  of  the  bit  abraded  the  side  of  the 
sandstone  block.  Frictional  ignition  was  obtained  with  an 
average  of  3.7  dry  cuts  and  was  not  obtained  with  63+  wet

cuts.  The  AMS  fan  spray  thus  significantly  reduced  the 
likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  with  the  THRU-FLUSH 
bit,  although  the  water  consumption  of  1  gpm  was  some- 
what high.

A  rectangular  bit  that  incorporates  a  water  spray  nozzle 
mounted  on  the  cutter  drum  directly  behind  the  bit,  with 
the  spray  passing  through  a  channel  in  the  bit  block  and 
impinging  onto  the  mineral  surface  in  back  of  the  bit,  is 
commercially  available  from  Hydra  Tools  International,

was  used  in  each  test.  The  51-cm-wide  sandstone  block 
was  moved  at  84  or  127  cm/min  across  the  drum  being 
rotated  at  42  rpm,  giving  26  or  17  cuts  during  1  pass  of  the 
block,  with  80  and  100  pet  of  the  width  of  the  cuts,  respec- 
tively, made  in  fresh  sandstone.  The  total  number  of  cuts 
to  obtain  ignition  with  a  new  steel  tip  was  counted. 

Results  (table  7)  did  not  depend  upon  cart  speed.  The 
three  bracketed  tests  in  footnote  1  involved  cutting  into 
damp  sandstone.  Ignition  was  obtained  with  an  average  of 
5.7  dry  cuts.  No  ignition  was  obtained  with  the  cone  or  jet 
spray  with  an  average  of  132  or  more  cuts.  The  cone 
spray  perhaps  could  be  considered  less  protective  than  the 
jet  spray,  in  view  of  the  two  ignitions  in  three  tests  at  100 
psig,  but  additional  replicate  tests  are  required.  The  jet 
spray  definitely  involves  considerably  greater  water 
consumption.

The  present  results  indicate  that  the  Hydra  Tools  back- 
spray  system  is  effective  in  reducing  the  likelihood  of 
frictional  ignition  with  a  worn  version  of  their  bit.  Of 
course,  ignition  with  only  a  few  dry  cuts  with  the  present 
steel-tipped  bit  does  not  indicate  the  ignition  performance 
of  the  commercial  Hydra  Tools  bit  with  its  tungsten- 
carbide  tip. 

CONICAL  BITS 

About  75  pet  of  the  frictional  ignition  incidents  in  U.S. 
coal  mines  (fig.  2)  involved  ripper-type  continuous  mining 
machines.  Application  of  the  back-spray  concept  to  a 
ripper  machine  involves  (1)  the  design  and  fabrication  of 
a  wet-head  ripper  drum  using  durable  large-diameter 
water  seals  and  (2)  careful  installation  of  properly 
engineered  water  spray  nozzles  behind  each  cutter  bit. 

In  the  early  1970's  several  Bureau-funded  field  stud- 
ies (22)  investigated  the  effect  of  drum-mounted  water 
spray  nozzles  on  respirable  dust  with  wet-head  ripper 
machines,  using  state-of-the-art  water  seals.  Results 
indicated  that  water  sprays  mounted  on  the  ripper  drum  in 
the  general  vicinity  of  the  cutter  bits  reduced  respirable 
dust  compared  with  conventional  boom-mounted  water 
sprays  and  did  not  interfere  with  visibility  or  splash  onto 


the  machine  operator.  However,  seal  life  was  severely 
limited.  A  durable,  large-diameter  water  seal  was  recently 
developed  by  Cannings  Seals  in  Great  Britain  and  has 
been  successfully  used  in  mining  equipment  in  Europe  and 
elsewhere  for  several  years.  A  wet-head  cutter  drum  for 
a  Simmons  Rand  265  continuous  mining  machine  using 
Cannings  water  seals  was  designed  and  fabricated  by 
Simmons  Rand  under  Bureau  contract  J0395040. 

However,  a  ripper  drum  usually  uses  conical  bits  with 
a  small  bit  attack  angle  while  a  shearer  drum  usually  uses 
rectangular  bits  with  a  large  attack  angle.  In  addition,  the 
bit  and  bit  block  of  a  conical  bit  may  physically  interfere 
with  the  back  spray  impacting  the  mineral  surface  immedi- 
ately behind  the  bit  to  a  greater  extent  than  occurs  with  a 
rectangular  bit  system  such  as  described  previously.  Also, 
there  may  be  insufficient  physical  space  on  the  ripper 
drum  to  locate  an  anti-ignition  spray  nozzle  directly  behind 
each  bit,  and  the  back-mounted  spray  nozzle  for  a  ripper 
drum  may  have  to  be  located  to  one  side  of  the  bit  and 
further  away  from  the  mineral  surface.  The  design  of  an 
anti-ignition  back-spray  system  for  a  conical  bit  on  a  ripper 
drum  thus  may  be  more  difficult  than  for  a  rectangular 
(radial)  bit  on  a  shearer  drum  because  of  spray-bit 
geometry. 

A  laboratory  study  of  the  anti-ignition  performance  of 
several  types  of  back-spray  nozzles  with  a  typical  conical 
bit  using  the  wet-head  segment  of  a  Joy  12CM  drum  is 
described  in  the  following  section.  A  recent  field  study  of 
a  specific  back-located  spray  nozzle  with  several  types  of 
conical  bits  using  the  fully  laced  Simmons  Rand  265  wet- 
head  drum  is  described  later. 

GTE 

A  commercial  "double-carbide"  GTE  Corp.  conical  bit 
being  used  in  a  coal  mine  in  which  a  future  field  test  was 
expected  to  be  performed  was  tested  with  the  wet-head 
segment  of  the  Joy  12CM  drum.  The  commercial  bit 
block  gave  a  bit  attack  angle  of  45°.  The  bit  and  bit  block 
involved  considerable  interference  with  the  back  spray  im- 
pacting the  mineral  surface  immediately  behind  the  bit. 
This  interference  was  especially  severe  for  a  bit  mounted 
on  the  end  of  the  drum. 

The  effect  of  spray  parameters  for  a  single  conical  bit 
mounted  in  the  middle  or  at  the  end  of  the  drum  was  in- 
vestigated. Water  spray  nozzles  were  located  on  the  cutter 
drum  in  back  of  and,  because  of  space  limitations  with  the 
Joy  12CM  as  laced,  to  one  side  of  the  bit.  The  spray 
nozzles  were  about  10  cm  from  the  tips  of  the  bits.  It  was 
expected  that  a  field  drum  would  channel  water  through  a 
scroll  mounted  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  drum.  The 
spray  nozzles  were  mounted  2  cm  above  the  surface  of  the 
drum  to  simulate  a  field  drum  with  scroll.  A  universal 
joint  was  used  to  facilitate  nozzle  orientation.  Figure  24 
shows  the  end  bit  with  its  spray  nozzle.

drum. 


Figure  25.-New  and  0.5-  and  0.75-cm-worn  GTE  bits,  left  to 
right 


The  base  of  the  bit  was  cut  with  a  slot  that  fit  over  a 
tongue  in  the  bit  block  to  prevent  the  bit  from  rotating 
during  cutting.  The  tip  of  the  bit  was  shortened  by  0.5  or 
0.75  cm  and  then  cut  to  have  a  flat  surface  to  simulate  a 
field  bit  that  had  become  frozen  and  had  worn  a  wear  flat. 
The  flattened  bit  purposely  exposed  part  of  the  steel  shank 
in  order  to  submit  the  anti-ignition  back  spray  to  a  severe 
test.  The  wear  flat  was  about  2.5  cm  wide  and  3  cm  long. 
Figure  25  shows  a  new  bit  on  the  left  and  0.5-  and 
0.75-cm-worn  bits  for  the  end  location  in  the  middle  and 
on  the  right.  A  newly  fabricated  flattened  bit  was  "worn 
in"  with  100  cuts  to  match  the  flat  on  the  bit  to  the  exca- 
vated arc  in  the  51-  by  51-  by  51-cm  block  of  sandstone. 
With  the  typical  cart  speed  of  28  or  71  cm/min  and 
the  drum  speed  of  39  rpm  used  in  the  field,  about  70  or 


29  cuts  were  respectively  made  in  the  block  during  1  pass. 
With  the  slower  cart  speed,  about  33  pet  of  the  bit  cut 
into  sandstone  and  67  pet  abraded  the  previously  cut  sur- 
face of  the  sandstone.  With  the  faster  cart  speed,  about  60 
pet  of  the  bit  cut  into  sandstone  and  40  pet  abraded  the 
previously  cut  surface. 

The  sandstone  used  in  these  studies  readily  absorbed 
water,  and  frictional  ignition  with  a  damp  sandstone 
surface  that  had  been  moistened  by  weather  or  a  previous 
wet  test  was  more  difficult  (required  more  cuts)  than  with 
a  dry  sandstone  surface.  In  four  instances  involving  a 
sequence  of  dry-wet-dry  tests  with  a  0.75-cm-worn  middle 
bit,  the  second  "dry"  test  involved  cutting  into  the 
dampened  sandstone  and  required  an  average  of  22.5  cuts 
for  ignition  instead  of  the  average  of  4.7  cuts  in  the  first 
dry  test  using  sandstone  that  had  been  dried  overnight. 
Later  tests  therefore  involved  only  one  wet  test  per  day, 
with  the  sandstone  block  then  dried  overnight  with  a  space 
heater. 

The  present  wet  results  were  very  sensitive  to  the 
precise  orientation  of  the  back  spray  nozzle,  in  that 
changing  the  aim  of  the  nozzle  relative  to  the  bit  by  only 
a  few  degrees  significantly  decreased  the  anti-ignition 
effectiveness  of  the  back  spray.  This  decrease  appeared  to 
be  due  to  water  impacting  the  bit  and  bit  block;  i.e.,  such 
water  again  seemingly  was  wasted  in  terms  of  anti-ignition 
performance.  The  spray  nozzles  were  oriented  initially  by 
visually  observing  the  spray  impaction  pattern  on  a  plastic 
sheet  held  to  simulate  the  impaction  plane  on  the 
sandstone  and  later  by  using  a  template. 

Results  are  given  in  table  8  and  reported  in  refer- 
ence 23.  Bracketed  tests  in  the  footnotes  were  considered 
to  be  outliers  due  to  cutting  into  damp  stone  or  to  a  poor 
nozzle  orientation.  Ignition  with  worn  bits  again  was 
readily  obtained  with  only  a  few  dry  cuts.  There  was  no 
drastic  difference  at  the  middle  and  end  locations;  e.g., 
with  a  0.75-cm-worn  bit,  ignition  was  obtained  with  an 
average  of  4.7  dry  cuts  with  the  middle  bit  and  5.0  dry  cuts 
with  the  end  bit.  Results  did  not  depend  upon  cart  speed. 

As  before,  the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  during  dry 
cutting  was  not  appreciably  reduced  when  the  drum  speed 
was  decreased;  i.e.,  with  the  0.75-cm-worn  middle  bit, 
ignition  was  obtained  with  5  and  7  dry  cuts  in  2  tests  when 
the  drum  was  operated  at  20  rpm  compared  with  the 
average  of  4.7  cuts  when  the  drum  was  operated  at 
39  rpm. 

Wet  cutting  with  a  carefully  oriented  back  spray  again 
significantly  reduced  the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition. 
With  0.5-cm-worn  middle  and  end  bits,  ignition  was  ob- 
tained with  an  average  of  6.9  and  2.8  dry  cuts  and  was  not 
obtained  with  60+  and  40+  wet  cuts.  Similarly,  with 
0.75-cm-worn  middle  bits,  ignition  was  obtained  with 
4.7  dry  cuts  and  was  not  obtained  with  39+  wet  cuts. 

The  planned  field  test  was  canceled  by  the  coal  mine 
operator.

Anti-Ignition-Modified  Cutter  Drum  for 

Simmons  Rand  265  Continuous 

Mining  Machine 

The  bit  lacing  for  the  wet-head  Simmons  Rand  265  rip- 
per machine  was  designed  by  AMS  for  moderate  cutting 
conditions  occurring  in  a  specific  mine  that  had  a  history 
of  frictional  ignitions  and  was  expected  to  provide  a  field 
test  site.  The  drum  was  laced  with  a  total  of  76  AMS 
conical  bits,  72  bits  in  the  center  part  of  the  drum  and  2 
bits  in  the  middle  part  of  each  end  of  the  drum.  The  bit 
blocks  gave  a  bit  attack  angle  of  52°.  Sufficient  space  was 
available  to  install  water  spray  nozzles  about  18  cm  behind 
the  tip  of  each  of  the  72  center  bits.  Figure  26  shows 
several  of  the  center  bits  and  their  spray  nozzles.  No  spray 
nozzles  were  used  behind  the  four  end  bits  because  of 
engineering  difficulties  in  channeling  water  to  the  end 
locations.  While  a  channeling  technique  could  un- 
doubtedly be  devised,  the  present  effort  was  limited  by 
financial  restrictions,  and  conveyance  of  the  water  to  the 
end  locations  was  postponed  to  a  future  effort  if  seal 
durability  in  the  field  could  be  demonstrated. 


The  AMS  solid-cone  spray  nozzle  (06-900870-000)  had 
a  20°  internal  angle  and  delivered  a  well-formed  spray  at 
0.3  gpm  and  50  psig.  Each  nozzle  was  carefully  oriented 
using  a  template  so  that  about  75  pet  of  the  spray  water 
impacted  the  mineral  surface  directly  behind  the  bit  and 
25  pet  of  the  water  impacted  the  bit  and  bit  block.  This 
spray  orientation  led  to  wastage  of  the  water  impacted  on 
the  bit  and  block  but  was  selected  in  view  of  the  sensitivity 
of  the  anti-ignition  performance  to  the  spray-bit  orienta- 
tion and  the  possibility  that  other  bits  might  be  used  in  the 
field.  No  laboratory  ignition  tests  were  done  with  this 
spray-bit  system. 

The  wet-head-modified  Simmons  Rand  265  machine 
was  installed  in  the  ignition-prone  mine  in  mid- 1987  in  a 
section  having  a  30- cm-high  sandstone  parting.  Figure  27 
shows  the  modified  drum  in  operation  in  the  mine.  Re- 
sults indicated  no  water  leakage  with  the  Cannings  water 
seals  during  the  mining  of  150,000  tons,  despite  several 
early  shifts  of  dry  operation  with  no  water  being  passed 
into  the  seals.  Miscellaneous  conical  bits  were  used.  No 
frictional  ignitions  have  occurred,  airborne  respirable  dust 
was  dramatically  reduced  according  to  visual  observation,

bit  life  increased  50  pet,  and  the  wet-head  drum  was  well

ity (24).  The  test  was  completed  in  mid- 1988  when  the 
mining  machine  was  removed  for  routine  maintenance 
overhaul.  Inspection  of  the  seals  indicated  that  they  were 
still  in  good  condition. 

Kenna metal  K-178DC 

A  conical  bit  that  incorporates  water  spray  nozzles 
directly  in  the  bit  block  behind  and/or  in  front  of  the  bit 
is  commercially  available  from  Kennametal  (K-178DC) 
(fig.  28).  The  bit  attack  angle  is  55°.  Kennametal  offers 
either  solid-  or  hollow-cone  or  jet  spray  nozzles.  Figure  29 
shows  the  bit  with  the  Kennametal  solid-cone  back  spray 
(Senior  Conflow  2801)  operated  at  150  psig.  Figure  30 
shows  the  Kennametal  jet  front  spray,  also  operated  at 
150  psig. 


Figure  29.-Kennametai  K-178DC  bit  with  solid-cone  back

The  anti-ignition  performance  of  the  Kennametal  back- 
and  front-located  spray  systems  was  investigated.  The 
anti-ignition  benefit  of  a  front-located  high-pressure  jet 
using  a  Bureau-designed  0.06-cm-diam  nozzle  orifice  also 
was  tested  during  other  work  investigating  the  enhance- 
ment of  cutting  (25).  The  Kennametal  tungsten-carbide 
tip  was  replaced  with  a  steel  tip  having  the  same  geometry 
in  order  to  subject  the  Kennametal  sprays  to  severe  test 
conditions.  A  new  steel-tipped  bit  was  used  in  each  test.

Figure  30.-Kennametal  K- 178  DC  bit  with  jet  front  spray  at

Results  are  given  in  table  9.  Ignition  was  obtained 
with  an  average  of  4.2  dry  cuts  and  was  not  obtained  with 
97+  wet  cuts  with  the  hollow-  or  solid-cone  spray  mounted 
in  back  of  the  bit.  With  the  front-mounted  Kennametal 
and  Bureau  jet  sprays,  ignition  was  obtained  in  about  half 
of  the  tests  at  each  of  the  cited  pressures. 

The  Kennametal  back  spray  thus  significantly  reduced 
the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition.  Again,  the  present  re- 
sults giving  ignition  with  only  a  few  dry  cuts  with  the  steel- 
tipped  bit  do  not  indicate  the  ignition  performance  of  the 
commercial  Kennametal  bit  with  its  tungsten-carbide  tip.

DISCUSSION 


Frictional  ignition  with  the  cutter  bits  on  a  mining 
machine  can  occur  when  the  mining  machine  is  cutting 
into  sandstone  (or  pyrite).  Conversely,  if  the  mining 
machine  is  cutting  into  sandstone,  the  mine  operator 
probably  should  expect  frictional  ignitions. 

Remedial  techniques  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of 
frictional  ignition  include 

1.  Mushroom-shaped  tungsten-carbide  bit  tips; 

2.  Increased  bit  clearance  angle,  e.g.,  with  conical  bits, 
increased  bit  attack  angle  and/or  decreased  internal  tip 
angle;  and 

3.  A  carefully  oriented  water  spray  nozzle  in  back  of 
each  cutter  bit. 

With  a  shearer  drum,  the  preferred  remedial  technique 
is  to  use  drum-mounted  back  sprays.  Fabrication  of  an 
anti-ignition  shearer  drum  involves  moving  the  variously 
located  antidust  water  spray  nozzles  on  the  commercially 
available  wet-head  shearer  drum  so  that  they  are  located 
directly  behind  each  of  the  bits  and  are  carefully  oriented 
so  their  sprays  impact  the  mineral  surface  directly  behind 
the  bits.  Several  anti-ignition  back  spray  and  bit  systems 
are  commercially  available  (e.g.,  AMS,  Hydra  Tools, 
Kennametal)  and  have  been  used  in  the  field.  An  antidust 
benefit  has  been  reported  with  the  anti-ignition  back  spray. 


A  wet-head  cutter  drum  for  the  Simmons  Rand  265 
continuous  mining  machine  that  incorporates  anti-ignition 
drum-mounted  back-located  spray  nozzles  was  developed 
by  Simmons  Rand  and  AMS.  However,  wet-head  cutter 
drums  for  other  continuous  mining  machines  are  not 
commercially  available  at  present.  In  the  interim,  the 
operator  can  use  the  mushroom  tip  and  increased 
clearance  angle  features  for  conical  bits  presently  being 
used  by  JWR  (15).  Mushroom-shaped  tips  for  conical  bits 
are  commercially  available. 

The  mine  operator  is  cautioned  that  no  anti-ignition 
remedial  technique  will  be  a  panacea  and  that  a  systematic 
schedule  must  be  used  to  replace  bits  before  they  have 
worn  to  a  dangerous  condition.  The  JWR  schedule  of 
replacing  bits  after  every  shuttle  car  is  loaded  when 
sandstone  is  being  cut  is  inconvenient  and  expensive  but 
is  probably  as  important  in  avoiding  frictional  ignition 
as  the  use  of  mushroom  tips  and  increased  bit  clearance 
angle  (15). 

Ignition  seemingly  can  be  obtained  with  almost  any  tip 
material  but  appears  less  likely  to  occur  (requires  more 
cuts)  with  a  harder,  more  durable  material.  With  conical 
bits,  ignition  was  typically  obtained  here  with  5  cuts  using 
a  medium-hard  steel  tip  and  50  cuts  using  a  hard  tungsten- 
carbide  tip.  Similar  results  were  obtained  with  the  more 
massive  rectangular  bits.  Ignition  with  the  Carmet  TC3  bit 


19 


required  about  10  cuts  with  a  steel  tip  but  was  not 
obtained  here  with  200  cuts  with  a  tungsten-carbide  tip.  A 
small,  1-mm2  wear  flat  did  form  on  the  carbide  tip,  and 
ignition  presumably  would  eventually  have  been  obtained 
with  the  larger  wear  flat  formed  with  additional  cuts.  The 
formation  of  a  similar  small  wear  flat  on  a  synthetic 
diamond  tip  was  observed  here  and  also  reported  by 
Roepke  (26).  The  wear  rates  of  diamond- tipped  and 
tungsten-carbide-tipped  rectangular  bits  were  not  mea- 
sured here  because  of  the  low  wear  rates  of  the  massive 
tips.  However,  field  tests  (27)  indicated  that  diamond- 
tipped  rectangular  bits  were  significantly  more  durable 
than  comparable  tungsten-carbide-tipped  bits  and  thus  may 
be  less  likely  to  cause  frictional  ignition. 

The  present  observation  that  a  lower  bit  velocity  did  not 
appreciably  decrease  the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition 
with  a  worn  bit  until  a  very  low  velocity  was  used  does  not 
agree  with  previous  studies  (5,  9-10).  This  disparity 
perhaps  is  due  to  differences  in  bits  or  test  procedures. 
The  present  procedure  involved  a  moving  bit  that  inter- 
mittently made  deep  cuts  into  new  locations  of  a  sandstone 
block,  while  the  study  reported  in  reference  5  used  a 
stationary  bit  making  a  continuous  deep  cut  into  a  new 
location  on  the  moving  sandstone  block  and  the  studies  in 
references  9  and  10  used  moving  bits  making  shallow  cuts 
into  the  same  location  on  a  stationary  sandstone  block. 
However,  the  present  results  indicate  that  a  lower  bit 
velocity  probably  is  not  a  reasonable  alternative  to  avoiding 
frictional  ignition  with  worn  bits  in  a  practical  mining 
operation. 

Improved  ventilation  is  often  proposed  as  a  remedial 
technique  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition. 
While  improved  ventilation  reduces  the  severity  of  the 
methane  explosion  that  results  from  a  frictional  ignition,  it 
probably  increases  the  likelihood  of  a  frictional  ignition. 
Methane  is  discharged  from  the  face  into  the  entry  and 
mixes  with  the  ventilation  airstream  in  the  entry.  A 
boundary  layer  automatically  forms  at  the  face,  wherein 
the  local  methane  concentration  is  high  at  the  face  and 
decreases  away  from  the  face.  A  combustible  methane- 
air  zone  therefore  must  be  formed  near  the  face.  If  the 
ventilation  is  increased,  the  total  amount  of  methane  in  the 
boundary  layer  is  decreased  but  the  combustible  methane- 
air  zone  is  moved  closer  to  the  ignition  source,  the  hot 
streak  at  the  face.  The  net  result  is  that  the  likelihood  of 
a  frictional  ignition  should  increase  as  the  ventilation 
increases,  but  the  severity  of  the  resulting  methane  ex- 
plosion should  decrease;  i.e.,  small  pops  occur  instead  of 
a  big  bang. 

The  anti-ignition  effectiveness  of  a  back  spray  depends 
upon  the  severity  of  the  hot  streak,  the  spray  density  at 
the  impaction  plane  on  the  sandstone,  the  cooling  effec- 
tiveness of  the  spray  drops,  and  the  spray-bit  geometry.  A 
minimum  water  density  at  the  spray  impaction  plane  of 
about  0.015  gpm/cm2  appears  to  be  required  to  cool  the 
hot  streak  formed  by  the  rectangular  Kennametal  K-100 
bit  during  severe  test  conditions.  With  the  spray  and 
conical  bit  system  used  with  the  GTE  bits,  a  minimum 
water  density  of  about  0.007  gpm/cm2  was  required  for  the 


middle  bit  but  0.015  gpm/cm2  was  required  for  the  end 
bit.  With  the  AMS  spray  used  on  the  Simmons  Rand 
265  drum,  the  water  density  also  was  0.007  gpm/cm2.  Such 
water  densities  can  be  readily  achieved  with  commercial 
water  spray  nozzles  using  modest  flow  rates  and  pressures, 
e.g.,  with  the  GG3004  nozzle  operated  at  0.5  gpm  and 
100  psig  or  with  the  AMS  nozzle  operated  at  0.3  gpm  and 
50  psig.  The  use  of  a  high  waterflow  rate  of  1  or  2  gpm  is 
commercially  popular  but  does  not  appear  to  be  required 
from  an  anti-ignition  viewpoint.  Powell  and  Billinge  (17) 
recently  reported  that  90-^m  drops  were  twice  as  effective 
as  200-/im  drops  in  cooling  the  hot  streak,  and  a  future 
study  of  improved  water  sprays  will  include  spray  nozzles 
selected  to  give  90-/im  drops. 

However,  continued  bit  wear  may  give  a  hot  streak  that 
is  not  adequately  cooled  by  this  water  density;  therefore, 
a  bit  replacement  schedule  still  should  be  used  with  a 
back-spray  technique,  but  a  less  frequent  bit  replacement 
would  probably  be  required.  Also,  although  all  back  spray 
systems  tested  here  successfully  reduced  the  likelihood  of 
frictional  ignition  by  all  bits  tested  here  by  a  very  signi- 
ficant degree,  other  bit  geometries  might  prevent  the  hot 
streaks  from  being  promptly  cooled  by  back  sprays  and 
thereby  allow  frictional  ignitions.  These  aspects  have  not 
yet  been  examined. 

The  present  observation  that  frictional  ignition  is  less 
likely  when  the  sandstone  contains  water  is  not  surprising 
and  was  reported  by  Titman  (28).  However,  the  natural 
water  in  the  sandstone  does  not  appear  significant;  i.e.,  the 
ignition  frequency  in  the  field  in  the  wet  summer  months 
was  comparable  to  the  frequency  in  the  dry  winter  months. 
Infusion  of  the  coal  seam  with  water  in  order  to  reduce 
respirable  dust  should  have  an  anti-ignition  benefit,  but  the 
degree  of  benefit  remains  to  be  determined. 

From  a  more  fundamental  viewpoint,  the  ignition  of  a 
methane-air  mixture  by  a  hot  surface  depends  upon  the 
temperature  and  area  of  the  hot  surface  and  the  exposure 
time.  With  an  electrically  heated  surface  and  a  1-s 
exposure  time,  Rae  (29)  reported  that  a  surface  tempera- 
ture of  about  1,400°  C  was  required  for  ignition  with  a 
10-mm2  surface  while  1,250°  and  1,200°  C  were  required 
with  50-  and  100-mm2  surfaces.  Similar  results  were  re- 
ported by  other  investigators  (30-33),  but  the  required  sur- 
face temperature  increased  as  exposure  time  decreased; 
e.g.,  with  a  10-ms  exposure  time,  1,900°  and  1,850°  C  were 
required  with  50-  and  100-mm2  surfaces. 

When  a  metal  bit  cuts  into  a  material  such  as  sand- 
stone, frictional  abrasion  leads  to  the  formation  of  a  wear 
flat  on  the  tip  of  the  bit  and  the  generation  of  heat  by  the 
wear  flat.  Following  Osburn  (34),  cutting  involves  a 
sequence  of  chipping-crushing-abrading  processes  such  as 
shown  in  figure  31,  where  the  tip  of  the  wear  flat  cuts  off 
a  chip  of  the  sandstone,  and  the  wear  flat,  which  has  a 
wear  angle,  then  crushes  the  remaining  layer  of  the  sand- 
stone and  also  abrades  the  newly  formed  sandstone  parti- 
cles against  the  sandstone  substrate.  It  is  generally 
thought  that  the  surfaces  of  the  wear  flat  and  the  sand- 
stone become  heated  by  abrasion  between  asperities  until 
the  melting  temperature  of  the  lower  melting  material  is

reached.  A  hot  smear  of  the  molten  material  then  forms 
on  the  surface  of  the  sandstone.  Further  heat  generation 
due  to  abrasion  is  considered  to  be  minor  since  the  contact 
area  is  lubricated  by  the  molten  material.  With  a  steel  tip, 
the  smear  is  considered  to  be  molten  steel  at  1,450°  C. 
With  a  high-melting  tip  material  such  as  tungsten  carbide, 
the  smear  is  usually  considered  to  involve  molten  silica 
(Si02)  at  1,710°  C.  Such  temperatures  are  sufficiently  high 
to  ignite  a  methane-air  mixture  if  the  area  and  exposure 
time  of  the  hot  smear  are  adequate. 

Blickensderfer  (9)  investigated  the  frictional  ignition  of 
a  methane-air  mixture  using  a  rectangular,  1-cm-wide  tool 
to  make  a  series  of  0.005-cm-deep  cuts  at  the  same  loca- 
tion in  a  10-cm-long  sandstone  block.  Ignition  with  a  steel 
tool  typically  required  about  75  cuts  with  a  tool  velocity  of 
450  cm/s  and  175  cuts  with  a  tool  velocity  of  150  cm/s.  A 
steel  smear  was  left  on  the  sandstone.  A  temperature  of 
about  1,400°  C  was  measured  directly  behind  the  tool  for 
about  2  ms  after  passage  of  the  tool,  which  then  decreased 
to  1,200°  C  in  an  additional  2  ms.  The  steel  smear  was 
about  20  /im  thick,  and  the  top  0.5-/im  layer  of  the  smear 
was  oxidized. 

Blickensderfer  (35)  developed  a  theoretical  model  of 
frictional  ignition  with  a  steel  tool  cutting  into  sand- 
stone. He  assumed  that  (1)  abrasion  between  the  wear 
flat  on  the  tool  and  the  sandstone  rapidly  heated  the 
surface  of  the  wear  flat  on  the  steel  tool  to  its  melting 
point  of  1,450°  C,  (2)  a  smear  of  molten  steel  was 
deposited  on  the  sandstone  and  was  maintained  at  its 


melting  point  until  the  tool  passed  on  and  exposed  the 
molten  smear,  and  (3)  the  exposed  molten  steel  smear 
then  cooled  by  heat  conduction  into  the  sandstone  sub- 
strate. The  steel  smear  theoretically  was  at  1,450°  C  for 
1.7  ms  after  exposure  because  of  the  heat  released  during 
solidification  of  the  molten  steel  smear  and  2.7  ms  if  the 
heat  of  oxidation  of  the  0.5-/xm  oxide  layer  on  the  steel 
smear  was  included.  With  a  tool  velocity  of  450  cm/s,  the 
length  of  the  molten  smear  was  12  mm  and  the  area  thus 
was  120  mm2.  Blickensderfer  concluded  that  such  a  hot 
surface  (1,450°  C  for  2.7  ms  with  a  120-mm2  area) 
reasonably  agreed  with  the  requirements  noted  earlier  for 
ignition  of  a  methane-air  mixture  with  electrically  heated 
surfaces. 

Blickensderfer  considered  that  the  likelihood  of  fric- 
tional ignition  decreased  as  the  area  of  the  molten  smear 
decreased.  When  the  tool  velocity  decreased  to  150  cm/s, 
the  theoretical  area  of  the  exposed  molten  smear 
decreased  to  40  mm2.  He  concluded  that  this  decrease  in 
molten  area  explained  the  increase  in  the  number  of  cuts 
experimentally  required  to  get  ignition  with  the  lower  tool 
velocity. 

Cutler  (37)  similarly  measured  a  streak  temperature  of 
about  1,400°  C  behind  a  tungsten-carbide-tipped  mining  bit 
cutting  into  sandstone. 

In  the  present  study,  the  nature  of  the  hot  streak 
formed  by  a  mining  bit  appears  to  be  complex.  Figure  4 
shows  that  the  streak  directly  behind  the  bit  initially  is  very 
hot:  i.e.,  the  film  was  overexposed  for  about  20  ms  (5  cm) 
after  passage  of  the  bit  because  of  the  high  local 
temperature.7  The  streak  then  cooled  to  show  a  series  of 
discrete  luminous  hot  spots  about  1  cm  or  so  apart  on  the 
surface  of  the  sandstone,  although  luminous  strips  about 
5  cm  long  occasionally  formed.  The  hot  spots  usually  were 
about  100  mm2  in  area.  Figure  32  gives  another  example 
of  the  series  of  hot  spots  formed  by  the  bit,  which  in  this 
case  had  passed  downward  out  of  the  field  of  view.  The 
hot  spots  at  the  bottom  and  top  of  figure  32  were  about 
20  and  100  ms  old,  respectively,  and  were  still  hot  enough 
to  be  luminous  but  did  not  give  ignitions. 

The  BCRNL  study  (18)  indicated  that  water  that  im- 
pacted the  sandstone  surface  further  than  5  cm  (20  ms) 
behind  the  bit  was  ineffective  in  preventing  frictional  igni- 
tion. Ignition  therefore  presumably  involves  the  very  hot 
spots  in  the  hot  streak  within  about  5  cm  behind  the  bit, 
because  the  spots  further  than  5  cm  behind  the  bit  seem- 
ingly had  cooled  to  a  safe  temperature. 

The  hot  spots  formed  here  during  an  early  nonigniting 
dry  cut  visually  were  similar  to  the  hot  spots  formed  during 
the  next  cut  that  gave  ignition.  Also,  ignition  always  oc- 
curred during  the  bottom  part  of  the  igniting  cut.  Thus,  a 
worn  bit  readily  generates  a  nonigniting  hot  spot  but  then 
undergoes  a  small  change  and  generates  an  igniting  hot 
spot. 

Photometric  measurement  here  of  streak  temperature  was  unsuc- 
cessful in  that  a  streak  temperature  of  about  1,100°  ±  300°  C  was  mea- 
sured behind  the  bit  with  both  steel  and  tungsten-carbide  tips.

Figure  32.-Spotty  hot  streak  formed  on  surface  of  sandstone. 


The  heat-generation  process  (or  processes)  taking  place 
when  a  metal  bit  cuts  into  sandstone  therefore  must  (1)  be 
intermittent  (to  generate  hot  spots)  and  (2)  be  sensitive  to 
small  changes  in  the  bit  (to  generate  the  igniting  hot  spot). 
A  spotty  type  of  hot  streak  and  the  qualitative  similarity 
between  nonigniting  and  igniting  hot  spots  do  not  appear 
to  have  been  reported  by  other  investigators. 

Intermittent  metal  smears  were  left  on  the  sandstone 
surface.  X-ray  analysis  of  the  smears  indicated  that  a  tip 
made  of  Type  4140  steel  left  a  steel  smear  while  a  cobalt- 
bonded  tungsten-carbide  tip  left  a  cobalt  smear.  The 
metal  smear  was  intermittent  and  did  not  appear  to  match 
the  more  regular  sequence  of  luminous  hot  spots  such  as 
shown  in  figure  32.  The  formation  of  a  metal  smear 
implies  melting  of  the  metal  tip. 

The  luminous  spotty  hot  streak  formed  on  sandstone  by 
a  steel  or  carbide  tip  in  a  nitrogen  environment  visually 
was  similar  to  the  luminous  streak  formed  in  an  air 
environment,  and  any  exothermic  oxidation  of  the  molten 
metal  smear  appears  to  be  of  secondary  importance.8 


Frictional  ignition  due  to  sandstone-sandstone  abrasion  (35-55)  is  not 
addressed  here. 


Heat  generation  during  the  cutting  of  sandstone  with  a 
metal  bit  presumably  involves  mechanical  friction  and 
depends  upon  the  normal  (perpendicular)  force  exerted  by 
the  wear  flat  of  the  bit  on  the  sandstone  substrate  during 
the  cutting  process.  With  the  present  cutting  technique,  a 
tangential  force  is  being  applied  to  the  bit  by  the  rotating 
cutter  drum  in  order  to  cut  the  sandstone,  but  no  external 
normal  force  is  being  applied  to  push  the  bit  against  the 
sandstone  target,  as  in  rubbing-friction  or  drill-bit  tests.  A 
local  normal  force  during  the  cutting  operation  does  occur 
if  a  wear  angle  forms  on  the  tip  of  the  bit  as  shown  in 
figure  31. 

An  intermittent  heat-generation  process  might  be 
the  formation  of  chips,  where  the  partly  formed  chip 
(fig.  31)  presses  the  wear  flat  against  the  sandstone  sub- 
strate and  thereby  momentarily  generates  a  high  local 
normal  force  on  the  bit.  Screen  analysis  of  the  particles 
formed  during  a  1-cm-deep  cut  indicated  that  30  pet  of 
the  mass  of  the  particles  were  large  flakes  with  a  nominal 
flake  diameter  greater  than  about  0.1  cm,  indicating  that 
chipping  does  occur.  The  normal  force  exerted  by  the 
bit  during  the  present  cutting  operation  has  not  yet  been 
measured. 

While  melting  of  the  steel  tip  implies  that  the  tempera- 
ture of  the  wear  flat  on  the  bit  during  cutting  is  about 
1,450°  C,  the  temperature  of  the  surface  of  the  wear  flat 
does  not  appear  to  have  been  directly  measured.  A  tem- 
perature of  about  400°  C  was  measured  with  a  thermo- 
couple 0.5  mm  below  the  surface  of  the  wear  flat  on  a 
rectangular  bit  continuously  cutting  into  sandstone  (39). 
A  similar  low  temperature  of  about  300°  C  was  measured 
here  with  a  thermocouple  1.2  mm  below  the  wear  flat  on 
a  conical  bit  intermittently  cutting  sandstone  and  also  was 
measured  with  a  thermocouple  inside  a  drill  bit  (40). 
However,  extrapolation  of  single  values  to  the  surface  of 
the  wear  flat  is  of  course  impossible. 

A  theoretical  model  of  the  temperature-time  history  of 
a  conical  steel  bit  having  a  wear  flat  and  intermittently 
cutting  into  a  sandstone  block  was  developed  by  Edwards 
at  the  Bureau's  Pittsburgh  Research  Center.  The  model 
involved  (1)  a  constant  rate  of  heating  of  the  interface 
between  the  wear  flat  on  the  bit  and  the  sandstone  surface 
during  the  cutting  part  of  the  drum  rotation  due  to  fric- 
tional abrasion  combined  with  cooling  by  heat  conduction 
into  the  bit  and  the  sandstone  and  (2)  heat  conduction 
into  the  bit  and  convective  cooling  of  the  bit  during 
the  remainder  of  the  rotation  cycle.  A  sawtoothed 
temperature-time  curve  resulted.  The  model  used  the  bit 
geometry  and  drum  rotation  speed  corresponding  to 
the  temperature-measurement  test  noted  above  and  a 
constant-area  wear  flat  of  0.7  cm2  obtained  in  a  separate 
ignition  test  that  gave  ignition  in  the  seventh  cut  with  this 
wear-flat  area.  The  theoretical  temperatures  1.2  mm 
inside  the  bit  and  at  the  surface  of  the  wear  flat  on  the  bit 
depended  linearly  upon  the  heating  rate.  The  heating  rate 
at  the  surface  of  the  wear  flat  was  varied  until  the 
theoretical  temperature  1.2  mm  inside  the  bit  matched 
the  experimental  temperature.  When  a  heating  rate 
of  90  cal/cm2  •  s  was  used,  the  theoretical  internal

Figure  33.-Theoretical  temperatures  inside  conical  bit  and  on 
wear-flat  surface  on  conical  bit 


temperature  matched  the  experimental  temperatures  of 
200°  C  at  the  end  of  the  7th  cut  and  300°  C  after  the 
20th  cut  (fig.  33). 

The  corresponding  theoretical  temperatures  of  the 
surface  of  the  wear  flat  were  only  400°  and  500°  C  after 
the  7th  and  20th  cuts,  while  the  observed  melting  of  the 
steel  wear  flat  implies  that  the  temperature  of  the  surface 
of  the  wear  flat  was  about  1,450°  C.  However,  Ueda  (41) 
recently  reported  that  the  temperature  inside  a  grinding 
wheel  abrading  a  steel  target  measured  with  a  thermo- 
couple was  considerably  lower  than  the  temperature 
measured  with  a  pyrometric  technique,  and  the  validity  of 
thermocouple  measurements  thus  is  uncertain. 

The  formation  of  the  wear  flat  would  seem  to  be  a 
critical  feature  of  the  ignition  process.  With  a  conical  bit, 
when  the  bit  attack  angle  decreased,  ignition  required 
fewer  cuts  with  a  new  bit  (fig.  8)  and  involved  a  larger 
area  wear  flat  on  the  used  bit. 

The  wear  rate  of  a  steel-tipped  conical  bit  was  in- 
vestigated by  measuring  the  area  of  the  wear  flat  formed 
on  a  new  bit  in  an  air  environment  versus  the  number  of 
cuts  in  the  sandstone  block.  The  area  of  the  wear  flat 
formed  after  a  few  cuts  was  measured  by  inking  the  wear 
flat,  pressing  the  inked  flat  against  graph  paper,  and 
counting  the  number  of  inked  squares.  A  few  additional 
cuts  were  then  made,  and  the  area  of  the  wear  flat  was

remeasured,  and  so  forth.  The  effect  of  bit  attack  angle 
8A  was  investigated.  A  constant  internal  bit  tip  angle  6T 
of  80°  was  used. 

Figure  34  plots  the  area  of  the  wear  flat  a  versus  the 
number  of  cuts  N  for  three  attack  angles  (9A  =  45°,  53°, 
and  70°).  The  area  increased  approximately  parabolically 
with  N.  The  area  also  increased  as  6A  decreased;  e.g., 
after  20  cuts,  the  area  was  0.5  cm2  if  6A  =  70°  and  1  cm2 
if  6A  =  45°.  Similar  results  were  observed  with  brass  and 
tungsten-carbide  tips. 

The  linear  wear  length  £,  perpendicular  to  the  sand- 
stone surface,  is  related  to  the  wear  flat  and  the  bit  geo- 
metry 6A  and  6T  for  a  conical  bit  as  shown  in  figure  35. 
The  wear  flat  is  oval  in  shape  because  of  the  slanted  wear 
of  the  conical  tip.  Approximating  the  oval  wear  flat  with 
a  circle  and  assuming  the  wear  flat  is  parallel  to  the  sand- 
stone surface,  £  is  related  to  the  wear-flat  area  a  by  sim- 
ple geometry,  with  £  =  J  a  •  { sin^yj  /[tan  (9T/2)  -J*]}. 
The  parabolic  a  -  N  relations  for  various  ©A's  in  figure  34 
convert  to  a  single  parabolic-type  £  -  N  relation  for  the  tip 
material,  which  is  independent  of  6A.  The  large  wear  flat 
obtained  with  a  small  8A  compared  with  the  small  wear 
flat  obtained  with  a  large  6A  thus  appears  to  be  a  simple 
geometric  effect  and  does  not  involve  a  variation  of 
£  with  6A.  The  value  of  £  does  depend  upon  the  nature 
of  the  tip  material  and  the  total  length  of  cut  L.  Since  the 
109-cm-diam  drum  is  cutting  into  a  51-cm-high  sandstone 
block,  each  cut  is  54  cm  long  and  L  =  54 -N  (in  centi- 
meters). Figure  36  plots  £  versus  L  for  brass,  steel  and 
carbide  tips.  The  wear  rate  of  a  tip  is  the  tangent  of  an 
£  -  L  curve.  Initial  wear  rates  were  high  and  depended 
upon  the  bit  material.  The  wear  rates  then  slowed  and 
were  similar  for  these  various  materials.

The  rapid  early  wear  of  a  drag-type  drill  bit  was  pre- 
viously reported  (42-43).  Neville  and  Crone  (43)  similarly 
observed  that  the  area  of  the  wear  flat  formed  on  a  drill 
bit  increased  if  the  bit  attack  angle  6A  decreased  and  that 
the  linear  wear  rate  of  the  bit  tip  was  independent  of  6A. 
They  concluded  that  (1)  wear  was  independent  of  the  ex- 
ternal normal  force  (thrust)  exerted  on  the  drill  bit 
because  the  bit  is  mainly  crushing  and  not  rubbing  the 
rock  and  (2)  any  temperature  effect  due  to  heating  of  the 
drill  bit  was  minor. 


The  variation  in  the  early  wear  rates  of  the  present 
three  materials  and  the  similarity  of  the  later  wear  rates 
suggest  that  different  aspects  of  the  wear  process  are 
important  in  the  early  and  the  later  stages  of  bit  wear, 
which  remain  to  be  explained. 

However,  the  area  of  a  wear  flat  formed  in  a  methane- 
air  environment  during  an  ignition  test  was  about  three 
times  larger  than  the  wear-flat  area  formed  in  an  air 
environment  with  the  same  number  of  cuts;  i.e.,  the  wear 
length  £  in  a  combustible  methane-air  environment  was 
about  two  times  the  wear  length  in  an  air  environment 
(fig.  36).  The  simplest  explanation  for  this  increase  in 
wear  rate  in  a  methane-air  environment  perhaps  is  that  a 
hot  spot  ignites  the  methane-air  mixture  to  form  a  micro 
flame  kernel  that  heats  the  surface  of  the  bit  (and  also  the 
sandstone)  but  is  quenched  by  the  bit  and  sandstone  sur- 
faces and  does  not  ignite  the  bulk  methane-air  environ- 
ment. The  hot  surface  of  the  wear  flat  then  wears  faster 
than  the  warm  surface  of  the  wear  flat  because  of  heat 
generated  only  by  friction;  this  process  forms  a  large-area 
wear  flat,  which  then  forms  a  macro  flame  kernel  that  ig- 
nites the  bulk  environment. 

A  working  hypothesis  for  the  mechanism  of  frictional 
ignition  with  a  new  frozen  conical  bit  cutting  sandstone 
thus  might  be  as  follows: 

1.  The  bit  tip  initially  abrades  very  rapidly  to  form  a 
small  wear  flat.  The  initial  linear  wear  rate  of  the  tip  is 
slower  with  a  harder  (more  durable)  tip  material. 

2.  The  tip  of  the  wear  flat  forms  chips  of  the  sandstone 
target,  and  the  wear  flat  abrades  the  remaining  layer  of  the 
sandstone  and  the  resulting  sandstone  particles.  During 
chip  formation,  the  normal  force  exerted  by  the  bit  on  the 
sandstone  target  is  momentarily  very  high,  leading  to  the 
intermittent  formation  of  a  small  hot  spot  on  the  surface 
of  the  sandstone. 

3.  The  small  hot  spot  on  the  sandstone  is  about 
1,450°  C  and  ignites  a  small  flame  kernel.  The  small  flame 
kernel  heats  the  wear  flat  and  increases  its  wear  rate 
but  is  quenched  by  the  bit  and  the  sandstone  and  does 
not  propagate  into  and  ignite  the  bulk  combustible 
environment. 

4.  The  area  of  the  wear  flat  on  the  bit  tip  increases 
because  of  frictional  abrasion.  The  rate  of  increase  of  the 
wear-flat  area  depends  upon  the  linear  wear  rate  of  the 
bit  tip  and  the  tip  geometry.  The  linear  wear  rate  is 
increased  in  a  combustible  environment  because  of  heating 
of  the  tip  by  the  flame  kernel.  Eventually,  a  large  flame 
kernel  ignited  by  a  large  hot  spot  formed  by  a  large-area 
wear  flat  propagates  into  and  ignites  the  bulk  combustible 
environment. 

A  similar  mechanism  should  apply  to  frictional  ignition 
with  a  rectangular-shaped  bit  except  that  the  geometrical 
relation  between  the  area  of  the  wear  flat  and  the  linear 


24 


wear  of  the  tip  of  the  rectangular  bit  will  be  different  from 
that  shown  in  figure  35. 

Major  features  requiring  clarification  include  hot-spot 
formation  by  chipping,  quenching  of  the  flame  kernel,  and 
cooling  of  the  hot  spots  by  the  back  spray.  E.g.,  the  bit 
geometry  presumably  should  have  a  significant  effect  on 
kernel  quenching  and  in  "protecting"  the  hot  spot  from 
being  cooled  by  the  spray  water  drops.  Detailed  investi- 
gation of  these  features  is  planned. 

It  should  also  be  noted  that  an  anti-ignition  back  spray 
may  also  achieve  an  antidust  benefit.  The  dust  cloud 
formed  when  a  conical  bit  cuts  into  sandstone  is  shown  in 
figure  37.  With  an  antidust  wet-head  cutter  drum  such  as 
discussed  in  reference  22,  the  drum-mounted  water  spray 
nozzles  usually  were  located  in  the  general  vicinity  of  the 
bits  and  the  water  drops  merely  filled  the  cavity  between 
the  surface  of  the  drum  and  the  face.  With  an  anti- 
ignition  wet-head  drum,  the  spray  nozzles  must  be  located 
behind  the  bit  and  must  be  carefully  aimed  to  impact  the 
mineral  surface  immediately  behind  the  bit.  The  anti- 
ignition  sprays  thus  are  pointed  directly  into  the  dust  cloud 
and  should  be  more  likely  to  capture  the  dust  particles.

CONCLUSIONS 


1.  In  the  United  States,  frictional  ignition  usually 
involves  a  metal  bit  cutting  into  sandstone  to  form  a  hot 
streak  on  the  surface  of  the  sandstone. 

2.  Frictional  ignition  always  involves  a  worn  bit  having 
a  wear  flat  on  the  tip  of  the  bit;  it  seemingly  can  be  ob- 
tained with  almost  any  bit  material  but  is  much  more  likely 
to  occur  with  a  steel  tip  than  with  a  tungsten-carbide  tip. 

3.  The  likelihood  of  frictional  ignition  decreases  with 
(1)  a  mushroom-shaped  tungsten-carbide  bit  tip  and  (2)  an 
increased  bit  clearance  angle.  A  field  test  with  conical- 
shaped  bits  in  a  coal  mine  supports  these  laboratory 
conclusions.  Commercial  versions  of  mushroom-shaped 
tungsten-carbide-tipped  conical  bits  are  available. 

4.  The  likelihood  of  ignition  is  not  significantly 
decreased  with  a  lower  bit  velocity  in  the  range  considered 
to  be  of  practical  interest. 

5.  The  likelihood  of  ignition  with  very  worn  bits 
significantly  decreases  if  water  spray  nozzles  are  located  in 
back  of  each  bit  and  are  carefully  oriented  so  that  the 
water  spray  impacts  and  cools  the  hot  streak  on  the 
sandstone  surface  immediately  behind  the  bit.  A  mini- 
mum water  density  at  the  impaction  plane  of  about 
0.007  gpm/cm2  is  apparently  required  and  can  readily  be 
achieved   with   commercial   spray   nozzles   operated   at 


moderate  conditions  (0.5  gpm,  50  to  100  psig).  The  like- 
lihood of  ignition  with  all  bits  tested  here  was  reduced  by 
using  a  carefully  designed  back  spray.  Commercial 
versions  of  back  spray  and  bit  systems  that  use  a  high 
waterflow  rate  (1  gpm)  are  available. 

6.  Replacement  of  worn  bits  must  be  scheduled.  The 
frequency  of  bit  replacement  will  depend  upon  the  reme- 
dial technique  but  may  range  from  every  shuttle  car  load 
(if  a  mushroom  bit  and  increased  bit  clearance  angle  are 
used)  to  every  week  (if  a  back  spray  is  used). 

7.  Formation  of  the  hot  streak  appears  to  involve  com- 
plex cutting-abrasion  phenomena.  Formation  of  local  hot 
spots  may  be  due  to  a  momentary  high  normal  force  on 
the  bit  because  of  chip  formation  during  the  cutting  pro- 
cess. The  hot  spot  perhaps  forms  a  micro  flame  kernel 
at  the  wear  flat  and  sandstone  interface,  which  heats  the 
bit  but  does  not  propagate  into  the  bulk  environment.  The 
heated  bit  would  then  wear  more  rapidly  to  form  a  large 
wear  flat,  which  forms  a  macro  flame  kernel  that  ignites 
the  bulk  environment. 

8.  An  anti-ignition  back  spray  may  also  achieve  an  anti- 
dust benefit  because  the  back  spray  is  aimed  directly  into 
the  dust  cloud  formed  by  the  cutter  bit.
