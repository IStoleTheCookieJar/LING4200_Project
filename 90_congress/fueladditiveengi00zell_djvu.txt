FUEL  ADDITIVE  AND  ENGINE  OPERATION  EFFECTS 
ON  DIESEL  SOOT  EMISSIONS 


By  H.  William  Zeller^ 


ABSTRACT 

The  Bureau  of  Mines  performed  laboratory  research  into  the  effects  of  a  barium-based  fuel  additive 
(the  "postflame"  type)  on  diesel  particulate  matter  (DPM)  emissions.  The  5.6-L,  six-cyUnder  test  engine 
is  typical  of  types  certifiable  for  use  in  underground  mines.  Test  pcU"£imeters  consisted  of  additive 
concentration  and  engine  loads,  speed,  and  air  intake  restriction.  DPM  emissions,  including  condensed 
volatiles,  were  measured  gravimetrically.  Also  measured  were  gaseous  emissions  including  carbon 
monoxide,  nitrogen  oxides,  and  hydrocarbons. 

The  fuel  additive  was  effective,  reducing  DPM  up  to  75  pet,  when  used  at  a  concentration  of  0.09  wt 
pet  (one-fourth  of  the  concentration  recommended  by  the  msmufacturer).  The  additive  was  most 
effective  at  the  highest  fuel-air  ratios,  reducing  DPM  from  400  mg/m'  for  untreated  fuel  to  120  mg/m^. 
At  Ught  loads,  25  pet  of  full  rated,  no  DPM  reductions  were  measured.  Based  on  these  results,  the 
additive  is  recommended  for  use  in  diesel  fuel,  at  a  concentration  of  0.09  wt  pet,  to  power  underground 
mining  equipment  as  long  as  certain  conditions  are  met:  that  a  beneficial  DPM  reduction  is  verified, 
that  the  minimimi  required  quantity  of  additive  is  used,  and  that  potential  adverse  effects  such  as 
increased  nitrogen  oxides  are  checked.

INTRODUCTION 


Diesel-powered  equipment  is  widely  used  in  under- 
ground mining  because  of  its  high  productivity  potential 
and  flexibility  compared  with  electric-powered  equipment. 
Unfortunately,  diesel  engines  emit  particulates  consisting 
of  insoluble  carbonaceous  agglomerates,  adsorbed  soluble 
organic  compounds,  and  traces  of  other  substances  such  as 
sulfates  and  metals.  Although  diesel  particulate  matter 
(DPM)  levels  are  not  specifically  regulated  in  underground 
mines,  DPM  adds  to  the  general  dust  level  amd  aggravates 
efforts  to  comply  with  respirable  dust  standards. 

To  help  mine  operators  comply  with  dust  standards  and 
to  reduce  potential  occupational  hezdth  problems  (1)^ 
arising  from  exposure  to  DPM  emissions,  the  Bureau  of 
Mines  is  conducting  research  on  improved  DPM  control 
methods  to  supplement  current  controls  such  as  ventila- 
tion, engine  maintenance,  and  operator  work  practices. 
The  emphasis,  to  date,  has  been  on  the  evaluation  of  the 
diesel  particulate  filter  (DPF)  for  coal  and  noncoal  mines 
(2-3).  However,  even  if  successful,  the  DPF  can  be  used 
on  inby  equipment  in  coal  mines  only  as  part  of  an  inte- 
grated exhaust  cooUng  and  filtering  system,  which  is  cur- 
rently still  under  development  (3). 

To  provide  the  mining  industry  with  alternatives  to  the 
DPF,  other  DPM  controls,  such  as  fuel  additives,  are 
being  evaluated  by  the  Bureau.  Additives  can  be  classified 
according  to  the  problems  they  are  designed  to  correct. 
"Preflame"  additives  are  designed  to  correct  problems  that 
occur  prior  to  burning  (that  is,  storage  stability,  flow  in 
cold  weather,  water  contamination)  and  include  disper- 
sants,  pour-point  depressants,  and  emulsifiers.  "Flame" 
additives  promote  complete  burning  of  fuel  in  the  com- 
bustion chamber  and  include  atomizers  and  combustion 
catalysts.  "Postflame"  additives  are  designed  to  reduce 
engine  deposits,  smoke,  and  emissions. 


The  Bureau  selected  a  bcu^ium-based,  postflame  product 
because  earUer  research  by  others  (4-6)  generally  con- 
cluded that  barium  was  more  effective  for  reducing  diesel 
soot  than  fuel  additives  such  as  iron  or  calcium  com- 
pounds. The  additive  tested  is  a  commercial  product, 
Lubrizol  565  (see  appendix).  Prior  research  on  postflame 
fuel  additives  by  the  Bureau  amd  others  was  reviewed  by 
ZeUer  (7-8). 

The  general  objective  of  this  work  was  to  determine  the 
effectiveness  of  a  barium-based  fuel  additive  for  reducing 
DPM  emissions.  Specific  objectives  were  as  follows:  (1) 
Determine  the  optimum  additive  concentration  for  mini- 
mum DPM  emissions,  (2)  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  addi- 
tive on  individual  components  of  engine  exhaust,  (3)  de- 
termine the  extent  of  amy  adverse  effects  of  the  additive, 
and  (4)  compare  the  results  with  those  from  earlier  tests 
on  a  different  engine  (7-8). 

In  this  report,  the  effects  of  the  additive  on  DPM  emis- 
sions are  examined  first.  Then,  effects  on  the  following 
specific  exhaust  components  are  examined:  (1)  solid  diesel 
particulate  matter  (SDPM),  (2)  volatile  diesel  particulate 
matter  (VDPM),  (3)  gas-phase  hydrocarbons  (GPHC),  and 
(4)  total  exhaust  hydrocarbons  (TEHC),  which  are  defined 
as  the  sum  of  the  VDPM  and  the  GPHC  in  the  exhaust. 
Both  the  volatile  and  gas-phase  hydrocarbons  are  consid- 
ered because  they  contain  the  carcinogenic  and  mutagenic 
compounds  that  may  have  adverse  health  effects  on  work- 
ers exposed  to  diesel  exhaust  (1).  The  effects  of  the  addi- 
tive on  both  carbon  monoxide  (CO)  and  nitrogen  oxides 
(NOJ  are  zilso  reported.  Finally,  the  results  for  DPM 
emissions  are  compared  with  those  from  a  different  engine 
tested  with  the  same  additive.

ENGINE  TEST  CONDITIONS 

Most  of  the  results  presented  in  this  report  were  ob- 
tained from  tests  conducted  on  a  Deutz^  F6L  912W  six- 
cyhnder,  four-cycle,  diesel  engine.  Versions  of  this 
indirect-injected,  naturally  aspirated,  air-cooled,  5.6-L 
engine  are  certified  for  underground  coal  mine  use  by  the 
U.S.  Mine  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (MSPIA) 
and  are  rated  for  82  hp  at  2,300  r/min.  The  engine  com- 
plied with  factory  specifications  for  power,  fuel  consump- 
tion, and  gaseous  emissions.  For  the  purpose  of  compar- 
ing different  engines,  selected  results  from  previous  tests 
(7-8)  on  a  Caterpillar  3304  engine  are  also  presented.  The 
Caterpillar  engine  is  generally  similar  to  the  Deutz  engine 
except  that  it  is  water  cooled  and  has  four  cylinders  instead 
of  six. 


Reference  to  specific  products  does  not  imply  endorsement  by  the 
U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines. 


Engine  loads  were  applied  by  an  eddy-current  universal 
dynamometer  and  were  controlled  by  a  microprocessor 
system  that  maintains  precise  speed  (±1  r/min)  and  load 
(±0.1  pet).  A  data  acquisition  system  recorded  up  to 
48  analog  inputs  from  various  transducers  such  as  ther- 
mocouples and  pressure  transducers. 

All  the  tests  were  conducted  at  steady-state  conditions. 
The  engine  was  started  and  brought  to  normal  operating 
temperature  before  any  test  sequence  was  begun.  Changes 
in  intake  air  density  affect  the  fuel-air  ratio  to  the  extent 
that  DPM  emissions  from  some  engines,  operated  at  or 
near  peak  torque  loads,  can  increase  about  10  pet  for  each 
1  pet  decrease  in  the  air  intake  density  (7).  For  this  rea- 
son, controls  on  the  engine  intake  system  are  used  for 
maintaining  air  intake  conditions.  The  manual  temper- 
ature and  automatic  pressure  controls  can  maintain  engine 
air  intake  density  to  within  ±0.5  pet  of  set  values. 

Three  air  intake  conditions  or  restrictions  were  adopted. 
At  an  air  temperature  of  77°  F  (25°  C),  the  small,  medium, 
and  large  intake  restrictions  are  respectively  equivalent  to 


pressure  drops  into  the  engine  of  8,  28,  and  53  in  HjO 
from  1  atm.  In  practice,  both  the  temperature  and  pres- 
sure of  the  engine  intake  air  were  controlled  to  maintain 
air  densities  equivalent  to  the  temperature-pressure  com- 
binations Usted.  Note  that  the  small-restriction  condition 
is  equivalent  to  the  Society  of  Automotive  Engineers 
(SAE)  (9)  recommended  power  test  conditions  for  dry  air. 
All  emissions  data  reported  here  are  adjusted  to  SAE 
conditions  of  temperature  and  pressure. 

Engine  exhaust  back  pressures  are  controlled  by  a  com- 
bination of  a  butterfly  valve  and  an  exhaust  fan.  Most 
engine  tests  were  conducted  with  only  a  few  inches  of 
water  back  pressure.  A  few  tests  were  conducted  at  back 
pressures  up  to  40  in  HjO,  the  engine  manufacturer's  rated 
maximxmi  (10-11). 

FUEL,  OIL,  AND  ADDITIVE  MIXING 

All  the  tests  were  conducted  with  the  same  batch  of 
No.  2-D  fuel.  No  chemical  analysis  for  this  fuel  is  avail- 
able. The  crankcase  oil  was  SAE  30  weight  and  was 
changed  at  100-h  intervals. 


The  additive  was  premixed,  by  weight,  with  the  fuel  in 
55-gal  drums  prior  to  testing.  Between  runs  involving 
different  fuel  mixtures,  the  engine  fueling  system  was 
drained  to  prevent  fuel  used  in  prior  tests  from  influencing 
the  results  of  subsequent  tests.  Any  residual  old  fuel  re- 
maining  in  the  system  after  draining  was  purged  by  oper- 
ating the  engine  for  at  least  1  h  using  the  new  fuel  mixture. 

EMISSIONS  MEASUREMENT 

Approximately  3  pet  of  the  raw  exhaust  was  diluted  and 
transported  to  the  sampling  section  (fig.  1)  where  the 
DPM  was  collected  on  fluorocarbon-coated,  glass-fiber 
filters.  Dilution  was  always  sufficient  to  maintain  filter 
temperatures  below  125°  F.  The  volatile  pzirticulate  on  the 
filters  was  determined  gravimetrically  jifter  treatment  in  a 
vacuimi  oven  at  a  temperature  of  392°  F.  Measurements 
of  nitrogen  oxides,  carbon  monoxide,  and  gas-phase  hy- 
drocarbons were  made  on  undiluted  exhaust  transported 
through  a  heated  (350°  F)  Une  (fig.  1). 


RESULTS  AND  ANALYSIS 


PARTICULATE  EMISSIONS 

The  two  largest  components  of  DPM  are  the  soUd 
fraction,  composed  mainly  of  carbon  and  sulfate  for  un- 
treated fuels,  and  the  volatile  fraction,  which  is  derived 
from  fuel  and  engine  lubricant.  For  barium-treated  fuel, 
the  solid  DPM  also  contains  barium  compounds.  In  the 
following  sections,  the  effects  of  engine  operating  param- 
eters on  DPM  are  presented  followed  by  an  exeunination 
of  the  effects  of  barium  on  total  DPM  and  on  the  two 
main  fractions-solid  and  volatile. 


All  the  data  in  figures  2  and  3,  plus  additional  results, 
are  displayed  more  concisely  in  a  single  chart  (fig.  4), 
plotting  emissions  against  fuel-air  ratio.  Some  of  the 
scatter  is  caused  by  experimented  error,  but  most  of  the 
observed  spread  is  attributable  to  engine  speed  effects. 


Diesel  Particulate  Matter 
Untreated  Fuel 

DPM  emissions  from  diesel  engines  depend  on  many 
variables,  including  speed,  torque  or  load,  and  air  intake 
conditions.  Figure  2  compares  the  average  DPM  mass 
concentration  for  the  Deutz  engine  at  four  loads,  one 
intake  condition,  and  one  speed.  Other  speed  and  intake 
conditions  produce  similar  plots.  Figure  2  shows  that  the 
lowest  DPM  concentrations  (40  mg/m^)  are  measured  at 
75  pet  of  full  load  jmd  that  lower  or  higher  loads  increase 
DPM.  The  maximum  emission  level  (115  mg/m^)  occurs 
at  full  load. 

DPM  emissions  are  plotted  for  full-torque  conditions  at 
four  speeds  and  three  intake  conditions  (fig.  3).  The  over- 
all range  of  emissions  is  almost  7:1  (60  to  400  mg/m^). 
At  fixed  intake  conditions,  speed  variations  produce  about 
a  3.5:1  range  of  DPM  emissions,  while  at  fixed  speed,  the 
intake  conditions  shown  have  about  a  2:1  effect  on  the 
DPM  emissions.

Figure  4.-DPM  emissions  from  Deutz  engine  as  function  of  fuel-air  ratio  for  untreated  fuel. 


For  fuel-air  ratios  less  than  0.04,  the  DPM  emissions 
rjinge  between  40  and  100  mg/m^  with  minimum  emis- 
sions measured  for  the  fuel-air  range  between  about  0.03 
and  0.035.  The  rapid  increase  in  DPM  emissions  for  fuel- 
air  ratios  greater  than  about  0.04  emphasizes  the  impor- 
tance of  maintaining  fuel-air  ratios  as  low  as  possible. 
This  can  be  accomplished  by  proper  maintenance  of  the 
engine's  air  and  fuel  systems  and  by  not  lugging  the 
engine. 

The  mine  ventilation  required  for  certified  engines  of 
this  type  is  85  cfm/hp  (10-11),  which  will  dilute  the  exhaust 
by  about  40:1.  Applying  this  dilution  factor  to  the  mea- 
sured emissions  (figs.  2-4)  indicates  that  the  in-mine  DPM 
levels  produced  by  this  engine  will  range  between  1  and 
10  mg/m^.  It  is  clear  that  this  engine  can  contribute  sig- 
nificantly to  mine  dusts. 

Barium-Treated  Fuel 

The  data  in  figure  5,  which  were  obtained  from  a  Cat- 
erpillar engine  (7),  illustrate  two  important  results  of  using 
barium-treated  fuel:  first,  barium  compounds  represent  a 
substantial  fraction  of  DPM,  especially  at  high  additive 
concentrations  in  the  fuel,  and  second,  the  non-barium 
fraction  (carbon,  sulfates,  and  volatiles)  at  each  of  the 
engine  loads  is  nearly  independent  of  additive  concentra- 
tion, which  suggests  that  the  additive  might  effectively 
reduce  DPM  at  even  lower  concentrations  than  the  0.18- 
wt-pct  level  shown. 

Experiments  were  conducted  on  the  Deutz  engine  to 
determine  the  optimum  concentration  required  to  mini- 
mize DPM  emissions.  The  results  (fig.  6)  are  for  additive 
concentrations  between  0.0  and  0.36  wt  pet,  engine  speeds 
of  90  and  100  pet  of  full-rated,  engine  torques  from  25  to 
100  pet  of  full  torque,  and  the  medium  intake  restriction. 

Examination  of  these  results  leads  to  the  following 
observations:  (1)  Even  the  minimum  additive  level  tested, 
0.02  wt  pet,  reduced  DPM  levels,  compared  with  untreated 
fuel,  (2)  the  most  effective  concentration  for  minimum 
DPM  emissions  under  the  test  conditions  was  0.09  wt  pet, 
(3)  most  of  the  results  obtained  for  0.18  and  0.36  wt  pet  at 
full  engine  speed  indicate  that  these  levels  are  too  high 
because  DPM  emissions  are  greater  than  those  for  0.09  wt 
pet. 

In  order  to  better  illustrate  overall  trends,  DPM  emis- 
sions are.  plotted  against  fuel-air  ratios  in  figure  7  for 
treated  and  untreated  fuel  (at  different  engine  intake  con- 
ditions, engine  speeds,  and  engine  loads).  Comparing 
untreated-fuel  results  with  those  for  the  0.09-wt-pct  addi- 
tive level  indicates  that  the  barium  additive  is  not  useful  at 
fuel-air  ratios  smaller  than  about  0.02.  The  effectiveness 
as  measured  by  DPM  reduction  from  the  untreated-fuel 
condition  cle£U"ly  improves  with  increasing  fuel-air  ratio. 


Also,  for  fuel-air  ratios  between  0.03  and  about  0.045, 
DPM  emissions  for  the  0.09-wt-pct  treatment  do  not  ex- 
ceed 50  mg/m^  while  DPM  levels  for  untreated  fuel  range 
up  to  250  mg/m^.  Only  at  the  highest  fuel-air  ratios 
tested  do  the  results  suggest  that  additive  levels  of  0.18 
jmd  0.36  wt  pet  may  be  slightly  more  effective  than  the 
0.09-wt-pct  treatment. 

Solid  Particulate  Fraction 

The  SDPM  fraction  is  the  material  remaining  on  the 
sample  filters  eifter  vacuum-oven  treatment.  The  values  of 
SDPM  for  untreated  fuel  (fig.  8)  show  how  the  soUd 
fraction,  in  this  case  mostly  carbon  and  sulfates,  increases 
uniformly  with  increasing  fuel-air  ratio.  Because  the  con- 
tribution of  volatiles  to  DPM  at  fuel-ciir  ratios  greater  than 
0,03  is  small,  the  SDPM  and  DPM  emissions  plots  are 
similar  at  high  fuel-air  values. 

To  illustrate  the  effect  of  barium  treatment  on  the 
particulate  soHds  fraction,  SDPM  is  plotted  in  figure  9  for 
one  engine  speed  condition  and  three  additive  concentra- 
tion levels.  By  restricting  the  plot  to  one  speed,  the  trends 
for  each  fuel  condition  are  clearly  delineated.  These  data 
emphasize  that  most  of  the  SDPM  reduction  attributable 
to  the  additive  occurs  at  high  fuel-air  ratios;  for  example, 
a  75-pct  reduction  (340  to  80  mg/m^)  was  obtained  at  the 
0.05  fuel-air  ratio.  No  sohds  reduction  is  observed  for  the 
lowest  fuel-air  ratios  of  about  0.016. 

Generally,  the  minimum  SDPM  levels  were  measured 
for  an  additive  concentration  of  0.09  wt  pet.  At  some 
fuel-air  ratios  between  0.03  and  0.035,  the  0.36-wt-pct 
additive  concentration  produced  slightly  greater  emissions 
than  those  measured  for  untreated  fuel. 

Volatile  Particulate  Fraction 

The  VDPM  mass  concentration  ranged  from  60  mg/m^ 
at  low  fuel-air  ratios  to  near  zero  at  high  fuel-air  ratios 
(fig.  10).  At  fuel-air  ratios  less  than  0.02,  the  minimum 
VDPM  levels  are  for  the  lowest  speed  tested.  This  result 
agrees  with  that  of  others  who  found  that,  at  light  loads, 
lubricating  oil  emissions  tend  to  increase  with  increasing 
engine  speed  (12). 

The  full  engine  speed  results  (fig.  11)  show  that  the 
barium-additive  treatment  results  in  reduced  VDPM  emis- 
sions. In  a  later  section,  "Hydrocarbon  Emissions,"  it  is 
shown  that  the  gas-phase  hydrocarbons  are  either  un- 
changed or  increased  slightly  with  the  fuel  treatment. 
Consequently,  it  is  suggested  that  the  VDPM  reduction  is 
caused  by  the  large  SDPM  reductions  (fig.  9),  which  in 
turn  reduce  the  particulate  surface  available  for  hydro- 
carbon adsorption  and  condensation.

Figure  11. -Additive  effect  on  VDPM  from  Deutz  engine  at  full  speed. 


Comparison  of  Solid  and  Volatile  Fractions 

The  results  (fig.  12)  for  full  engine  speed  and  the  small 
intake  restriction  were  selected  to  illustrate  the  relative 
levels  of  the  solid  and  volatile  particulate  components  for 
both  treated  and  untreated  fuels.  For  the  Deutz  engine 
and  for  both  treated  and  untreated  fuel,  the  solid  fraction 
(SDPM)  is  the  main  component  of  DPM  for  fuel-air  ratios 
greater  than  about  0.025,  while  at  smaller  fuel-air  ratios 
the  volatile  fraction  (VDPM)  is  the  main  constituent  of 
DPM.  The  most  obvious  effect  of  the  additive  is  reduction 
of  the  solid  component,  although,  as  noted  in  previous 
sections,  some  volatile  reduction  also  occurs. 

Also  (fig.  12),  for  treated  fuel  (0.09  wt  pet),  the  nearly 
constant  level  of  SDPM  between  30  and  40  mg/m^,  in 
conjunction  with  the  results  in  figure  6,  suggests  a  mini- 
mum DPM  level  and  maximum  effectiveness  of  DPM 
reduction  using  barium.  At  full  load,  the  barium  rate 
into  the  engine,  for  0.09-wt-pct  additive  in  the  fuel,  is 
52  mg/min.  If  all  the  barium  is  emitted  as  barium  sulfate 
(7)  in  the  exhaust,  the  concentration  is  about  25  mg/m^, 
the  major  portion  of  the  SDPM  emitted.  There  are  other 
unknown  substances  in  this  commercial  additive  that  may 
also  be  emitted  as  solid  components  in  the  exhaust.  The 
point  is  that  the  composition  of  the  additive  may  be  a 
significant  limiting  factor  in  DPM  reduction;  therefore,  it 
is  important  to  use  only  sufficient  additive  to  achieve  the 
required  or  desired  effectiveness.

HYDROCARBON  EMISSIONS 
Gaseous  Hydrocarbons 

The  untreated-fuel  GPHC  mass  concentration  emissions 
are  plotted  (fig.  13)  for  all  test  conditions.  The  range  of 
GPHC  concentrations  (plotted  as  methane  equivalent)  is 
large-between  10  and  80  mg/m^.  There  will  be  no  at- 
tempt to  identify  trends,  because  of  the  complex  inter- 
actions among  engine  speed,  engine  load,  and  engine  in- 
take conditions.  An  additional  complicating  factor  is  the 
probability  that  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  GPHC  orig- 
inates from  the  engine  lubricating  oil,  especially  at  light 
loads  and  high  speeds  (12). 

GPHC  emissions  for  both  treated  and  untreated  fuels 
are  plotted  in  figure  14,  where  the  untreated-fuel  data  are 


the  same  as  those  plotted  in  figure  13.  It  is  apparent  that 
the  main  effect  of  the  additive  is  to  reduce  the  overall 
range  of  the  GPHC  emissions,  especially  at  fuel-air  ratios 
greater  than  0.025.  The  minimum  GPHC  level  observed 
for  treated  fuel  is  about  25  mg/m^,  compared  with  the 
minimum  of  about  10  mg/m^  observed  for  untreated  fuel. 
The  increase  in  GPHC  for  treated  fuel  can  be  explained  by 
referring  back  to  figure  11,  which  showed  that  the  con- 
densed volatiles,  or  VDPM,  were  decreased,  on  the  aver- 
age, by  barium-treated  fuel.  Consequently,  it  follows  that 
if  the  exhaust  hydrocarbons  do  not  condense  on  the  par- 
ticulate fraction,  then  they  must  remain  in  the  gas  phase  as 
observed.  What  is  not  explained  is  why  the  GPHC  levels 
for  treated  fuel  (fig.  14)  decrease  with  increasing  additive 
concentration.  Additive  effects  on  exhaust  hydrocarbons 
are  examined  further  in  the  following  section.

Total  Exhaust  Hydrocarbons 

Diesel  exhaust  is  a  complex,  dynamic  system  in  which 
the  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  the  species  present 
continuously  change  with  time.  For  the  purpose  of  this 
discussion,  the  following  are  assumed:  (1)  The  diluted 
exhaust,  from  which  the  filter  sample  is  extracted,  is  rep- 
resentative of  the  state  of  the  VDPM  in  the  exhaust  pipe; 
that  is,  adsorption,  desorption,  and  condensation  are  fully 
quenched  at  the  instant  of  dilution;  (2)  the  heated  gas 
sampling  line  provides  a  representative  GPHC  sample  to 
the  instruments.  If  these  conditions  are  met,  then  an 
estimate  of  TEHC  is  determined  as  follows: 

TEHC  -  VDPM  +  GPHC, 

when    expressed    in    consistent    units    such    as    mass 
concentration. 

Calculated  values  of  TEHC  are  plotted  (fig.  15)  against 
fuel-air  ratio.  No  strong  trends  are  apparent.  Of  more 
interest  are  the  treated-fuel  levels  of  TEHC  for  full-speed 
conditions  (fig.  16)  along  with  untreated-fuel  data  also  for 
full-speed  conditions;  all  three  intake  conditions  are  plot- 
ted here.  There  are  two  observations.  First,  the  average 
TEHC  levels  do  not  appear  to  be  substantially  changed 
when  all  treated-fuel  results  are  compared  with  all 
untreated-fuel  data.    Additive  effects  on  TEHC  are  not 


significant  relative  to  the  reductions  measured  for  SDPM 
(fig.  9).  On  the  other  hand,  looking  only  at  the  treated- 
fuel  results,  TEHC  levels  appear  to  decrease  with  increas- 
ing additive  concentration,  as  a  result  of  the  decrease  in 
GPHC  levels  with  increasing  barium  concentration. 

TOXIC  GASEOUS  EMISSIONS 

Nitrogen  Oxides 

Nitrogen  oxide  emissions  for  different  speeds,  loads, 
intake  restrictions,  and  additive  treatments  are  plotted 
against  fuel-air  ratio  (fig.  17).  In  general,  nitrogen  oxide 
formation  increases  with  temperature  and  with  the  avail- 
ability of  oxidizing  agents  during  combustion.  For  exam- 
ple, combustion  temperature  is  related  directly  to  fuel-air 
ratio  and  in-cylinder  oxygen  concentration  is  related  in- 
versely to  fuel-air  ratio.  As  a  result,  some  of  the  nitrogen 
oxide  emission  plots  (fig.  17)  peak  at  about  a  fuel-air  ratio 
of  0.04. 

For  untreated  fuel,  the  lowest  nitrogen  oxide  levels  of 
about  100  mg/m^  were  measured  for  the  largest  restriction 
(minimum  oxygen)  and  low  fuel-air  ratios  corresponding 
to  minimum  temperatures.  The  highest  levels  for  un- 
treated fuel,  around  800  mg/m^  were  for  the  smallest 
intake  restriction  (higher  oxygen  levels)  and  high  fuel-air 
ratios  (high  temperatures).

Figure  17.-Comparison  of  nitrogen  oxide  concentrations  from  Deutz  engine  for  treated  and 
untreated  fuels. 


Overall,  the  treated-fuel  nitrogen  oxide  levels  were 
greater  than  those  measured  for  untreated  fuel  at  the  same 
fuel-air  ratios.  The  0.36-wt-pct  additive  treatment  and 
small  restriction  produced  the  highest  nitrogen  oxide  levels 
for  a  given  fuel-air  ratio.  This  general  increase  in  nitrogen 
oxide  levels  for  treated  fuels  is  assumed  to  be  the  result  of 
the  oxidizing  effect  of  barium.  These  results  again  empha- 
size the  importance  of  not  using  any  more  additive  in  the 
fuel  than  necessary  for  DPM  reduction. 

Carbon  Monoxide 

The  carbon  monoxide  exhaust  emissions  are  plotted 
(fig.  18)  against  fuel-air  ratio.  The  effect  of  the  additive 
on  carbon  monoxide  levels  is  mixed,  which  suggests  that 
the  additive  will  produce  neither  positive  nor  negative 
effects  on  carbon  monoxide  in  the  exhaust. 

ENGINE  COMPARISON 

The  purpose  of  this  section  is  a  limited  comparison  of 
the  DPM  emissions  from  two  different  engines:  the  Deutz 
engine  tested  in  this  research  and  a  Caterpillar  3304 


engine  evaluated  earlier  (7-8).  The  comparison  is  limited 
because  test  data  for  the  Caterpillar  engine  are  available 
only  for  low-speed  tests  at  1,200  r/min  or  67  pet  of  the 
full-rated  speed  (1,800  r/min)  for  that  engine. 

The  DPM  emissions  for  untreated  fuel  (fig.  19)  are 
expressed  in  power-specific  mass  rate  to  help  account  for 
the  differences  in  the  test  loads  and  speeds  for  the  two 
engines.  Over  the  full  range  of  fuel-air  ratios,  the  Cat- 
erpillar engine  emissions  are  smaller  than  those  from  the 
Deutz  engine,  including  the  full-speed  Deutz  engine  data. 

DPM  emissions  are  shown  in  figure  20  for  a  fuel  treat- 
ment of  0.18  pet  (the  smallest  concentration  data  avail- 
able for  the  Caterpillar  engine)  for  both  engines,  plus  0.09- 
wt-pct  additive  results  for  the  Deutz  engine.  The  data 
show  that  for  treated  fuel  the  Deutz  engine  emits  less 
DPM  at  most  fuel-air  ratios.  In  other  words,  the  additive 
appears  to  be  more  effective  for  the  Deutz  engine,  with 
the  qualification  that  this  result  may  be  related  to  the 
fact  that  the  speed  of  the  Deutz  engine  was  greater- 
1,840  r/min  (80  pet  of  full-rated  speed)  compared  with 
1,200  r/min  for  the  Caterpillar  engine  (67  pet  of  full-rated 
speed).  If  the  two  engines  could  be  compared  at  the  same 
speeds,  the  results  might  be  different.

CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 


At  fuel-air  ratios  between  0.01  and  0.052,  the  DPM 
emissions  of  the  Deutz  engine  ranged  between  35  and 
420  mg/m^.  For  fuel-air  ratios  up  to  about  0.04,  the 
maximum  DPM  levels  measured  were  less  than  about 
120  mg/m^,  a  result  that  emphasizes  the  importance  of 
operation  at  high  speed  with  minimum  intake  restrictions 
(clean  air  filters)  in  order  to  maintain  low  fuel-air  ratios. 

The  DPM  emissions  from  the  Deutz  engine  were  com- 
pared with  those  from  a  Caterpillar  engine.  For 
untreated-fuel  operation,  the  DPM  levels  from  the  Cater- 
pillar engine  were  less  than  those  from  the  Deutz  engine 
over  the  entire  range  of  fuel-air  ratios  tested. 

For  maximum  DPM  reduction  over  the  entire  range  of 
fuel- air  ratios,  the  most  effective  additive  concentration 
evaluated  was  0.09  wt  pet.  Only  at  the  maximum  fuel-air 
ratios  tested  did  the  manufacturer's  recommended  concen- 
tration of  0.36  wt  pet  seem  to  impart  a  marginal  additional 
benefit  in  reducing  DPM  compared  with  the  0.09-wt-pct 
treatment.  Additive  concentrations  as  low  as  0.02  wt  pet 
were  observed  to  produce  some  DPM  reductions. 

The  effect  of  the  additive  on  nitrogen  oxide  and  carbon 
monoxide  emissions  was  complex.  Overall,  nitrogen  oxide 
levels  tended  to  increase  while  carbon  monoxide  levels 


remained  within  the  xmtreated-fuel  range.  Because  emis- 
sion levels  of  both  these  gases  are  well  within  acceptable 
limits  for  the  tested  conditions  and  because  the  changes 
are  small,  the  effect  of  the  additive  on  nitrogen  oxide 
should  be  considered  in  mine  applications  but  is  not  ex- 
pected to  be  a  problem  for  well-maintained  engines  and 
properly  ventilated  mines. 

This  barium-based  additive  is  recommended  for  re- 
ducing DPM  emissions  from  diesel-powered  equipment 
used  in  xmderground  mines  if  the  following  conditions  are 
met: 

1.  The  additive  reduces  excessive  particulate  levels 
and  is  used  mainly  in  equipment  having  heavy  work-duty 
cycles  involving  substantial  periods  of  full  or  near-full 
load  operation. 

2.  The  additive  is  used  at  the  minimum  concentration 
required  to  produce  the  measured  DPM  reduction  ob- 
served. Based  on  results  in  this  report,  the  suggested 
concentration  is  0.09  wt  pet. 

3.  Potential  adverse  effects  such  as  unacceptable  nitro- 
gen oxide  increases  should  be  checked.
