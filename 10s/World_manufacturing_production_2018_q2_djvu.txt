Report  on  world  manufacturing  production 


This  report  presents  the  observed  growth 
rates  and  growth  estimates  of  world  manufactu¬ 
ring  production  for  the  second  quarter  of  2018. 
The  figures  are  based  on  the  index  numbers  of 
industrial  production  (IIP)  collected  by  UNIDO 
Statistics  from  national  data  sources. 

IIP  measures  the  growth  of  the  volume  of 
industrial  production  in  real  terms,  free  from 
price  fluctuations.  Users  are  advised  to  take 
note  that  while  annual  industrial  growth  rates 
generally  refer  to  changes  in  manufacturing 
value  added  (MVA),  i.e.  output  net  of  interme¬ 
diate  consumption,  the  quarterly  indices  reflect 
the  growth  of  gross  output.  Given  the  tempo¬ 
ral  nature  of  estimates,  output  growth  provides 
the  best  approximation  of  value  added  growth, 
assuming  that  the  input-output  relationship  is 
relatively  stable  during  the  observation  period. 

UNIDO  has  been  publishing  quarterly  re¬ 
ports  on  world  manufacturing  since  2011.  The 
data  compilation  and  presentation  methods  are 
regularly  updated.  Earlier  reports  included  in¬ 
dex  figures  for  some  countries  which  were  not 
seasonally  adjusted  or  for  which  no  information 


on  seasonal  adjustments  was  available.  Growth 
figures  have  been  published  based  on  season¬ 
ally  adjusted  index  numbers  since  2013.  The 
TRAMO/SEATS  method1  in  the  JDemetra-f- 
software  has  been  used  since  2017  to  make  sea¬ 
sonal  adjustments.  The  purpose  of  seasonal  ad¬ 
justments  is  to  filter  out  any  fluctuations  or  cal¬ 
endar  effects  within  time  series  shifts. 

In  2013,  UNIDO  Statistics  introduced  new 
country  groups,  with  economic  territories  being 
classified  based  on  their  stage  of  industrializa¬ 
tion.  This  grouping  is  implemented  in  all  of 
UNIDO’s  statistical  publications.  The  grouping 
is  particularly  useful  for  presenting  aggregated 
growth  estimates  by  country  group  at  different 
levels  of  industrialization.  In  the  aftermath  of 
the  economic  crisis,  the  pattern  of  growth,  par¬ 
ticularly  in  industrialized  and  developing  coun¬ 
tries,  differed  considerably.  A  comparative  pic¬ 
ture  of  growth  trends  in  different  parts  of  the 
world  has  been  provided  to  users.  The  full  list 
of  economies  used  in  the  country  groups  is  avail¬ 
able  in  the  International  Yearbook  of  Industrial 
Statistics2. 


1TRAMO  stands  for  Time  series  Regression  with  ARIMA  noise,  Missing  values  and  Outliers,  and  SEATS  for  Signal 
Extraction  in  ARIMA  Time  Series.  ARIMA  is  the  abbreviation  of  Autoregressive  Integrated  Moving  Average,  a  widely 
applied  statistical  method  for  time  series  analyses.

Statistics  for  Quarter  II,  2018 


The  present  report  implements  Revision 
4  of  the  International  Standard  for  Industrial 
Classification  of  All  Economic  Activities  (ISIC 
Rev  4) 3  in  the  quarterly  data.  For  countries 
that  publish  monthly/quarterly  index  numbers 
based  on  ISIC  Rev  4,  national  data  are  used 
in  their  original  form.  For  countries  that  still 
produce  index  numbers  based  on  ISIC  Rev  3, 
growth  figures  are  estimated  at  the  2-digit  level 
of  Rev  4  using  correspondence  tables.  In  both 
cases,  data  on  index  numbers  are  derived  from 
national  statistical  sources.  In  case  of  missing 
data,  UNIDO  conducts  imputations  or  projec¬ 
tions,  where  appropriate.  These  estimates  are 
generally  replaced  as  soon  as  the  officially  re¬ 
ported  values  become  available  in  national  sta¬ 
tistical  publications. 

Growth  rates  are  calculated  from  the  na¬ 
tional  index  numbers  that  are  aggregated  to 
the  given  country  group  or  world  region  us¬ 


ing  weights  based  on  the  country’s  contribution 
to  world  manufacturing  value  added  in  2010. 
The  country  groups  are  based  on  economic  ter¬ 
ritories  rather  than  political  boundaries.  This 
report  presents  the  growth  figures  for  country 
groups  by  stage  of  industrial  development  and 
geographic  region. 

Users  can  find  further  information  on  the 
methodology  of  index  numbers,  estimation  pro¬ 
cedure  or  compilation  of  the  country  groups’  in¬ 
dices  in  a  methodological  document4  which  is 
available  on  the  statistical  pages  of  UNIDO’s 
website,  together  with  the  actual  indices  pub¬ 
lished  in  UNIDO’s  Quarterly  IIP  database, 
available  on  the  UNIDO’s  Statistics  Data  Por¬ 
tal5. 

This  report  presents  estimates  for  the  se¬ 
cond  quarter  of  2018  as  well  as  revised  estimates 
for  the  first  quarter  of  2018.

MVA  growth  prospects  in  2018 


World  manufacturing  growth  is  expected 
to  remain  stable  in  2018.  However,  the  prospects 
of  dynamism  are  hampered  by  a  risk  of  a  major 
downturn  caused  by  a  new  wave  of  protection¬ 
ism.  Even  though  current  data  indicate  stability 
in  industrial  growth,  new  tariffs  and  economic 
sanctions  in  addition  to  uncertainties  related  to 
Brexit,  are  considered  impending  threats  that 
may  lead  to  a  slowdown  of  global  industrial 
growth  in  the  near  future.  Despite  these  chal¬ 
lenges,  the  positive  impact  of  improved  growth 
conditions  in  industrialized  economies  in  2016- 
2017  on  global  manufacturing  is  expected  to  con¬ 
tinue.  As  a  result,  world  manufacturing  value 
added  (MVA)6  is  likely  —  according  to  the  latest 
estimates  —  to  sustain  a  3.9  per  cent  growth  rate 
in  2018.  This  implies  that  the  previous  year’s 
pace  will  be  maintained,  as  revised  growth  fig¬ 
ures  for  2017  show.  Figure  1  presents  a  more 
detailed  picture  of  the  performance  of  different 
country  groups. 

MVA  in  industrialized  economies  is  ex¬ 
pected  to  expand  at  a  rate  of  2.7  per  cent  in 
2018.  While  growth  in  European  countries  is 
seen  to  stabilize  at  2.9  per  cent,  North  Amer¬ 
ica’s  growth  rate  is  likely  to  increase  from  2.0 


per  cent  in  2017  to  3.0  per  cent  in  2018,  partly 
due  to  U.S.  fiscal  stimulus  generating  a  short¬ 
term  boost.  East  Asian  industrialized  economies 
are  likely  to  experience  some  slowdown  in  MVA 
growth.  After  3.4  per  cent  increase  in  2017,  their 
economic  performance  has  remained  solid  and 
will  likely  reach  a  growth  rate  of  2.3  per  cent.

Statistics  for  Quarter  II,  2018 


China’s  MVA  growth  is  predicted  to  stay 
slightly  above  6.0  per  cent,  which  implies  only 
a  minor  decline  of  the  world’s  largest  manufac¬ 
turer’s  growth  rate  in  the  context  of  increasing 
tensions  over  trade  with  the  United  States. 

The  growth  performance  of  developing  and 
emerging  industrial  economies  (excl.  China)  has 
been  improving  continuously,  resulting  in  4.4  per 
cent  expected  growth  in  2018  on  a  year-to-year 
basis.  A  closer  look  reveals  that  the  Asia  and 
Pacific  region  is  the  fastest  growing  region  in  this 
country  group,  and  will  likely  reach  a  growth 
rate  of  6.7  per  cent  in  2018.  Eastern  European 
countries  are  expected  to  prosper  as  well  with 
an  increase  in  MVA  of  5.2  per  cent  in  2018, 
which  however  is  much  lower  than  the  7.3  per 
cent  recorded  in  2017. 

MVA  growth  in  Latin  America  registered 
a  slightly  positive  value  (+0.4  per  cent).  Cen¬ 
tral  America  and  the  Caribbean  in  particular  are 
likely  to  grow  by  1.6  per  cent  each  in  2018,  while 
uncertainties  in  South  America  might  lead  to  a 


slight  decline  of  MVA  compared  to  2017  (-0.3 
per  cent). 

Africa’s  performance  is  generally  expected 
to  continue  improving,  as  growth  has  been  ob¬ 
served  across  the  African  continent.  Africa’s 
overall  growth  rate  of  3.2  per  cent  in  2018  is 
the  highest  growth  rate  in  years.  Countries  of 
the  Southern  African  Development  Community 
(SADC)  recorded  a  comparably  slower  rate  of 
growth,  with  an  increase  of  1.6  per  cent  in  MVA, 
while  the  Eastern  Africa  region  achieved  5.7  per 
cent.  The  MVA  of  African  LDCs  is  expected 
to  grow  by  around  4.2  per  cent,  which  is  higher 
than  in  the  previous  year,  but  much  lower  than 
the  rate  required  to  achieve  SDG  9.2  by  2030. 

In  general,  manufacturing  growth 
prospects  for  2018  remain  positive.  The  growth 
performance  of  several  world  regions  has  main¬ 
tained  a  solid  pace.  African  LDCs  pose  the 
main  challenge,  with  the  pace  of  industrializa¬ 
tion  remaining  too  slow  to  achieve  SDG  9.2  by 
2030.

World  manufacturing  growth  in  quarter  II  2018 


The  rate  of  world  manufacturing  growth 
in  the  second  quarter  of  2018  slightly  declined 
against  the  backdrop  of  escalating  tensions  over 
global  trade.  Despite  these  problems,  global 
manufacturing  output  rose  by  3.8  per  cent  in 
the  second  quarter  of  2018  compared  to  the 
same  quarter  of  the  previous  year.  Although 
the  growth  rate  is  below  the  4.2  percent  regis¬ 
tered  in  the  first  quarter,  it  still  indicates  strong 
momentum.

♦  China  ♦  World 


The  stable  growth  of  industrialized  econo¬ 
mies,  accounting  for  over  half  of  world  industrial 
output,  has  played  a  major  role  in  this  develop¬ 
ment.  New  fiscal  stimuli  adopted  by  some  coun¬ 
tries  are  expected  to  further  boost  short-term 
growth  and  continue  to  drive  and  strengthen 
world  manufacturing  output.7  At  the  same 
time,  increased  trade  tensions  may  have  detri¬ 
mental  effects  on  production  growth  and  jobs. 

Data  for  the  second  quarter  of  2018  indi¬ 
cate  a  deceleration  in  the  expected  annual  ma¬ 
nufacturing  growth  of  all  country  groups  (Fig¬ 
ure  2).  China  is  an  exception  which  is  presented 
separately. 

While  manufacturing  in  industrialized  eco¬ 
nomies  has  not  reached  the  desired  level  of  dy¬ 
namism,  growth  in  this  country  group  has  been 
stable.  In  the  second  quarter  of  2018,  manu¬ 
facturing  output  rose  by  2.5  per  cent  compared 
to  the  same  period  in  2017.  This  growth  was 
attributable  to  the  sustained  recovery  of  Eu¬ 
rope’s  manufacturing  sector,  which  increased  by 
3.0  per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018.  At 
the  same  time,  North  America’s  manufacturing 
output  rose  by  1.8  per  cent.  After  a  slightly 
weaker  performance  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018,

the  year-to-year  growth  rate  of  East  Asia’s  in¬ 
dustrialized  economies  reached  a  solid  2.6  per 
cent  again.  The  Republic  of  Korea  recovered 
from  a  weak  performance  in  the  first  quarter 
and  witnessed  an  improved  growth  of  2.9  per 
cent  compared  to  the  first  quarter  2018. 

China,  the  world’s  largest  manufacturer, 
maintained  a  robust  year-over-year  growth  rate 
of  around  6.4  per  cent,  despite  ongoing  trade 
tensions. 

The  manufacturing  output  of  developing 
and  emerging  industrial  economies  (excluding 
China)  registered  the  most  dynamic  develop¬ 
ment  in  recent  quarters.  The  growth  pattern 
of  the  upswing  throughout  the  2017  quarters  as 
well  as  the  cool-down  in  the  first  half  of  2018 
followed  a  more  erratic  path  in  comparison  to 
China  or  the  group  of  industrialized  countries, 
resulting  in  an  overall  growth  rate  of  3.7  per  cent 
compared  to  the  same  quarter  of  2017. 

Developing  economies  in  Asia  and  the  Pa¬ 
cific  recorded  a  high  growth  rate  of  4.8  per  cent 
in  the  second  quarter  of  2018,  supported  by 
strong  growth  in  India  (+5.3  per  cent)  and  In¬ 
donesia  (+4.6  per  cent).  An  even  higher  increase 
of  5.3  per  cent  was  observed  in  the  group  of  de¬ 


veloping  economies  in  the  Eastern  Europe  re¬ 
gion. 

The  overall  year-to-year  growth  in  Latin 
America  slowed  to  1.3  per  cent  but  sustained 
its  momentum  in  the  second  quarter  despite 
some  turbulence  in  a  number  of  the  regions’ 
economies.  After  a  period  of  strong  expansion, 
the  growth  rate  of  Brazil’s  manufacturing  sector 
dropped  to  0.8  per  cent  compared  to  the  second 
quarter  2017.  Argentina,  another  key  economy 
of  the  region,  even  experienced  a  shrinking  ma¬ 
nufacturing  output  of  -1.9  per  cent  in  an  uncer¬ 
tain  monetary  environment  backed  by  assistance 
from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  to  reduce 
peso  volatility. 

Growth  estimates  based  on  limited  data 
also  show  a  positive  growth  rate  of  around  1.6 
per  cent  for  Africa’s  manufacturing  output. 

In  short,  despite  a  noticeable  slowdown  in 
the  pace  of  growth  in  some  regions,  manufac¬ 
turing  production  expanded  across  all  industri¬ 
alized  and  developing  countries  in  the  second 
quarter  of  2018  compared  to  the  same  period  of 
the  previous  year,  which  confirms  the  sustained 
recovery  of  manufacturing  at  the  global  level.

Findings  by  country  group 


Industrialized  economies 


According  to  UNIDO  estimates,  indus¬ 
trialized  regions,  namely  East  Asia,  Europe 
and  North  America,  maintained  positive  growth 
rates  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018.  With  some 
moderate  deceleration,  these  countries’  manu¬ 
facturing  output  rose  by  2.5  per  cent  compared 
to  the  same  period  of  the  previous  year. 

The  robust  growth  of  manufacturing  ob¬ 
served  in  European  industrialized  economies 
since  2014  has  recently  undergone  a  downward 
trend.  This  is  especially  visible  when  the  data 
are  compared  to  2017,  a  year  characterized  by 
high  growth  rates.  For  instance,  the  year-to-year 
growth  of  manufacturing  output  reached  5.1  per 
cent  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2017.  The  first 
half  of  2018  showed  a  notable  deceleration.  The 
manufacturing  output  growth  rate  dropped  to 
4.0  per  cent  in  the  first  quarter  and  decreased 
further  to  3.0  per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of 
2018.  However,  there  is  no  hard  evidence  yet 
whether  this  is  anyhow  related  to  a  soft  cyclical 
downturn. 

A  closer  look  at  the  leading  eurozone  eco¬ 
nomies  reveals  that  year-on-year  manufacturing 
output  increased  by  2.9  per  cent  in  Germany, 
2.5  per  cent  in  Italy,  2.1  per  cent  in  Spain  and 
1.4  per  cent  in  France.  With  the  exception  of 
Malta  (-2.9  per  cent)  and  Portugal  (-0.3  per 


cent),  the  manufacturing  production  of  other  eu¬ 
rozone  economies  continued  to  witness  positive 
growth.  Slovenia  achieved  a  remarkable  growth 
rate  (6.8  per  cent),  as  did  Austria  (6.2  per  cent) 
and  Lithuania  (6.0  per  cent).  A  fairly  robust 
growth  rate  was  furthermore  observed  in  Slo¬ 
vakia  (4.0  per  cent),  the  Netherlands  (3.7  per 
cent)  and  Finland  (3.5  per  cent).

Beyond  the  eurozone,  Sweden  (+4.8  per 
cent),  Hungary  (+3.6  per  cent)  and  Czechia 
(+2.8  per  cent)  recorded  higher  growth  in  manu¬ 
facturing  output  than  Denmark  (+1.9  per  cent) 
or  the  United  Kingdom  (+1.4  per  cent).  As  for 
the  latter,  the  European  Central  Bank  generally 
points  to  short-term  indicators  for  the  export- 
oriented  manufacturing  sector,  signalling  a  less 
optimistic  outlook,  as  the  latest  negotiations 
on  the  country’s  withdrawal  from  the  European 
Union  in  March  2019  have  created  an  environ¬ 
ment  of  heightened  uncertainty.8 

Among  non-EU  economies,  Switzerland, 
one  of  the  worlds  most  advanced  economies, 
experienced  an  impressive  high  year-on-year 
growth  rate  of  9.6  per  cent  on  the  back  of 
a  strong  performance  in  the  manufacturing  of 
pharmaceuticals  and  the  manufacturing  of  com¬ 
puter,  electronic  and  optical  products.  Belarus, 
which  in  accordance  with  UNIDO  criteria  has  re¬ 
cently  joined  the  group  of  industrialized  econo¬ 
mies,  recorded  a  remarkable  growth  rate  in  the 
second  quarter  of  2018  as  well  (+4.6  per  cent). 
Norway’s  manufacturing  output  has  grown  con¬ 
tinuously  over  the  last  quarters,  but  at  0.7  per 
cent  compared  to  the  same  quarter  of  the  previ¬ 
ous  year,  its  growth  rate  indicates  a  comparably 


low  pace. 

The  State  Statistics  Service  of  the  Russian 
Federation  recently  published  revised  figures  on 
industrial  production  resulting  in  higher  season¬ 
ally  adjusted  estimates  of  year-on-year  growth 
of  Russia’s  manufacturing  output.  According  to 
updated  figures,  manufacturing  output  rose  by 
2.9  per  cent  in  the  first  quarter  and  by  2.8  per 
cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018. 

North  America’s  overall  manufacturing 
production  grew  by  1.8  per  cent  compared  to 
the  same  period  of  the  previous  year,  with  an  in¬ 
crease  of  1.8  per  cent  for  both  the  United  States 
and  Canada. 

Japan’s  manufacturing  output  rose  by  2.1 
per  cent,  the  eighth  straight  quarter  of  year- 
on-year  growth  of  manufacturing  production. 
Industrial  momentum  remains  strong  in  the 
world’s  third-largest  manufacturer.  The  coun¬ 
try’s  manufacturing  output  was  boosted  by  the 
growth  of  machinery  and  equipment  as  well 
as  the  automotive  industry.  Among  other 
East  Asian  economies,  Singapore,  Taiwan  and 
Malaysia  showed  a  strong  performance  with  a 
growth  rate  of  10.3  per  cent,  6.8  per  cent  and 
4.6  per  cent,  respectively.

Developing  and  emerging  industrial  economies 


Consistent  with  the  last  quarterly  report 
(Quarter  I,  2018),  China  is  generally  presented 
separately  from  other  country  groups  due  to  its 
size  and  new  characteristics  of  its  economy,  as 
the  country’s  extended  high  growth  period  is 
rapidly  transforming  China  into  an  industrial¬ 
ized  economy.

China 

China’s  manufacturing  output  rose  by  6.4 
per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018.  The 
country’s  pace  of  year-on-year  growth  declined 
in  comparison  to  that  of  the  2017  quarters. 
However,  considering  the  escalating  trade  ten¬ 
sions  with  the  United  States,  this  growth  rate 
seems  quite  impressive,  especially  as  the  sea¬ 
sonally  adjusted  quarterly  growth  rate  remained 


positive  at  1.5  per  cent  compared  to  the  first 
quarter  2018.  The  strongest  growth  perfor¬ 
mance  was  observed  in  the  production  of  motor 
vehicles  with  an  increase  of  13.2  per  cent  com¬ 
pared  to  the  same  period  of  the  previous  year. 
Computer  electronics  (11.9  per  cent)  and  phar¬ 
maceuticals  (10.3  per  cent)  both  prolonged  their 
periods  of  two-digit  growth.  The  combined  ex¬ 
pansion  of  medium  high-  and  high-technology 
industries  was  estimated  at  9.1  per  cent,  indicat¬ 
ing  a  significant  shift  of  Chinese  manufacturing 
from  low-  to  high-tech  industries. 

Developing  and  emerging  industrial  eco¬ 
nomies  (excl.  China) 

More  evidence  of  a  slowdown  in  manu¬ 
facturing  output  was  observed  in  developing 
and  emerging  industrial  economies  (excluding 
China),  especially  when  compared  to  Chinese 
data.  Figure  4  illustrates  the  respective  dynam¬ 
ics  over  the  last  quarters  in  further  detail,  re¬ 
vealing  that  emerging  industrial  economies  still 
grew  by  3.4  per  cent  compared  to  the  same  pe¬ 
riod  of  the  previous  year. 

The  growth  performance  of  Asia  and  the 
Pacific  region  remained  stable  at  a  high  level 
of  4.8  per  cent  compared  to  the  same  period  of 
the  previous  year.  India’s  manufacturing  out¬ 
put  grew  by  5.3  per  cent  and  therefore  sub¬ 
stantially  contributed  to  this  development  as 
did  Indonesia  with  4.6  per  cent.  Mongolia  and 
Bangladesh  continued  their  year-on- year  double-

digit  growth  periods.  The  manufacture  of  tex¬ 
tiles  and  wearing  apparel  are  the  main  drivers  of 
this  development  in  Mongolia  and  Bangladesh. 
Manufacturing  has  also  been  a  key  driver  of 
growth  for  the  Philippines  (+11.5  per  cent). 

Manufacturing  output  data  for  Latin 
American  economies  draw  a  diverse  picture 
against  the  backdrop  of  turbulences  and  uncer¬ 
tain  prospects  in  key  economies.  Overall,  the  re¬ 
gion’s  year-on-year  growth  reached  1.3  per  cent. 
While  Mexican  data  was  solid,  showing  a  growth 
rate  of  1.7  per  cent,  Uruguay,  Chile,  Colombia 
and  Ecuador,  in  particular,  performed  well  with 
growth  rates  of  11.5  per  cent,  5.3  per  cent,  4.7 
per  cent  and  4.0  per  cent,  respectively.  By  con¬ 
trast,  Brazil’s  impressive  growth  in  recent  quar¬ 
ters  dropped  sharply  from  over  4.0  per  cent  to 
0.8  per  cent,  underscored  by  a  nationwide  truck¬ 
ers’  strike  that  affected  many  industries  in  Latin 
America’s  largest  economy.  Argentina’s  growth 
rate  even  declined  by  1.9  per  cent  compared  to 
the  same  quarter  of  the  previous  year.  Experts 
attribute  this  to  struggling  businesses  due  to 
peso  depreciation  and  high  interest  rates  as  the 
Central  Bank  seeks  to  combat  inflation. 

Among  Africa’s  economies,  South  Africa, 
the  region’s  most  industrialized  country,  regis¬ 
tered  a  0.3  per  cent  marginal  positive  growth  in 
the  second  quarter  of  2018  compared  to  the  same 


period  of  the  previous  year.  Positive  growth 
rates  were  also  achieved  in  Tunisia  (1.2  per 
cent),  Morocco  (3.0  per  cent),  Senegal  (3.7  per 
cent)  and  Egypt  (4.3  per  cent).  Accompanied 
by  a  strong  growth  rate  in  Cote  d’Ivoire  (6.5 
per  cent),  UNIDO  estimates  for  developing  eco¬ 
nomies  in  Africa  indicate  a  growth  of  1.6  per 
cent  compared  to  the  same  period  of  the  pre¬ 
vious  year.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that 
estimates  for  Africa  are  based  on  limited  data, 
revealing  high  instability  and  volatility. 

As  regards  other  developing  economies, 
the  manufacturing  output  of  Eastern  European 
countries  grew  by  5.3  per  cent  compared  to  the 
same  period  of  the  previous  year.  Manufactu¬ 
ring  output  rose  by  10.2  per  cent  in  the  Republic 
of  Moldova,  7.2  per  cent  in  Albania,  7.1  per  cent 
in  Romania  and  6.7  per  cent  in  Poland.  Turkey’s 
manufacturing  sector  performed  quite  well  in  the 
second  quarter  compared  to  the  same  quarter  of 
2017  (+5.1  per  cent),  but  the  country’s  quar¬ 
terly  growth  rate  dropped  to  -0.9  percent.  In  the 
last  quarter  before  the  expiration  of  the  third 
and  last  Economic  Adjustment  Programme  on 
20  August  2018,  Greece’s  manufacturing  output 
has  continued  to  grow  on  a  year-on-year  basis 
since  the  beginning  of  2016,  but  at  a  lower  pace 
in  the  second  quarter  of  2018  at  1.6  per  cent.

Findings  by  industry  group 


Global  manufacturing  production  showed 
a  positive  growth  rate  in  all  industries  in  the 
second  quarter  of  2018.  Industries  grouped  ac¬ 
cording  to  technological  intensity  yet  again  fol¬ 
lowed  growth  patterns  that  reveal  that  medium 
high-  and  high-technology  manufacturing  indus¬ 
tries  outperform  other  industry  groups. 

However,  as  depicted  in  Figure  5,  only 
medium-technology  industries  were  able  to  resist 
the  slightly  decelerating  growth  rates  in  manu¬ 
facturing  output  and  reached  a  higher  year-on- 
year  growth  rate  at  2.9  per  cent  compared  to 
the  previous  quarter.  This  is  due  to  improved 
growth  in  industrialized  economies  as  well  as 
in  China.  With  the  processing  of  non-metallic 
mineral  products  and  the  manufacturing  of  ba¬ 
sic  metals,  this  category  even  includes  some  ma¬ 
jor  industries  affected  by  tariffs  and  protection¬ 
ist  measures.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  how 
these  industries  will  evolve  in  the  forthcoming 
quarters. 

Medium  high-  and  high-technology  ma¬ 
nufacturing  industries  reached  a  year-on-year 
growth  rate  of  5.4  per  cent  in  the  second  quar¬ 
ter  of  2018.  This  was  largely  driven  by  strong 
growth  of  around  9.1  per  cent  in  China.  In¬ 
dia’s  contribution  is  noteworthy  as  well,  with  a 
growth  rate  of  9.1  per  cent. 

A  decomposition  of  medium  high-  and 
high-technology  industries  reveals  that  the 


global  production  of  basic  pharmaceutical  prod¬ 
ucts  recorded  the  highest  growth  rate  at  8.2  per 
cent.  It  was  the  first  time  in  two  years  that  this 
industry’s  performance  was  at  least  as  strong 
as  the  manufacturing  of  computers,  electronics 
and  optical  products,  both  attaining  a  year-on- 
year  growth  rate  of  8.2  per  cent.  The  growth  of 
machinery  and  equipment  was  very  solid  with 
a  growth  rate  of  5.4  per  cent  compared  to  the 
same  quarter  of  the  previous  year.

Overall  global  production  in  the  impor¬ 
tant  group  of  low-technology  manufacturing  in¬ 
dustries  diminished  slightly,  but  still  rose  by  a 
solid  2.4  per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  2018

compared  to  the  same  period  of  the  previous 
year.  Above  all,  relatively  high  growth  rates 
were  again  achieved  worldwide  in  the  produc¬ 
tion  of  basic  consumer  goods  -  the  global  man¬ 
ufacture  of  food  products  rose  by  3.4  per  cent, 
leather  products  by  3.7  per  cent  and  the  global 
manufacture  of  beverages  increased  by  4.1  per 
cent. 

Figure  6  illustrates  the  growth  rates  for 
various  industries  in  detail,  showing  expanding 
industries.  Weak  data  were  recorded  in  coke  and 
refined  petroleum  products  in  industrialized  eco¬ 


nomies,  particularly  in  North  America.  While 
the  United  States  had  a  negative  growth  rate  of 
2.7  per  cent  compared  to  the  same  quarter  of 
the  previous  year,  Canada  experienced  a  sharp 
year-on-year  decline  of  -19.3  per  cent.  Planned 
shutdowns  at  several  refineries  for  maintenance 
and  retooling  work  contributed  to  the  country’s 
lower  production. 

Additional  data  on  growth  rates  in  the  se¬ 
cond  quarter  of  2018  are  available  in  the  Statis¬ 
tical  Tables.
