terms  and  provisions  of  this  Oil  and  Gas  Lease. 

5  If  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  not  being  produced  on  said  land,  or  from  the  land  pooled  therewith,  but 
Lessee  is  then  engaged  in  drilling  or  reworking  operations  thereon,  or  shall  have  completed  a  dry  hole  thereon  within  60  days  prior  to  the  end  of  the  primary 
Ste  Se  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  operations  on  said  well  or  for  drilling  or  reworking  of  any  additional  well  are  prosecuted  with  nocessation .of

Lessee  by  instrument  filed  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which  the  leased  premises  are  situated  at  any  time  after  u!e  completion  of  a 
dry  hole  or  the  cessation  of  production  on  said  unit.  In  the  event  a  well  or  wells  producmg  oil  or  gas  in  paying  quantities  should  be  brought  in  on  adjacen 
land  and  within  330  feet  of  and  draining  the  leased  premises,  or  land  pooled  therewith,  Lessee  agrees  to  drill  such  offset  well  or  wells  as  a  reasonably  prudent 
operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances.  Lessee  may  at  any  time  execute  and  deliver  to  Lessor  or  place  of  record  a  release  or  release 
covering  any  portion  or  portions  of  the  above  described  premises  and  thereby  surrender  this  lease  as  to  such  portion  or  portions  and  be  relieved  of  all

shall  be  drilled  within  two  hundred  (200)  feet  of  any  residence  or  barn  now  on  said  land  without  Lessor's  consent. 

7  The  rights  of  either  party  hereunder  may  be  assigned  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  the  provisions  hereof  shall  extend  to  their  heirs,  successors  and 
assigns-  but  no  change  or  division  in  ownership  of  the  land,  or  royalties,  however  accomplished,  shall  operate  to  enlarge  the  obl.gations  or  diminish  the rights 
of  Ussee-  and  no  change  or  division  in  such  ownership  shall  be  binding  on  Lessee  until  thirty  (30)  days  after  Lessee  shall  have  been  furnished  by  registered 
U  S  mail  at  Lessee's  principal  place  of  business  with  a  certified  copy  of  recorded  instrument  or  instruments  evidencmg  same.  In  the  event  of  assignment 
hereof  in  whole  or  part,  liability  for  breach  of  any  obligation  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  upon  the  owner  of  this  lease  or  a  portion  Uiereof who  comtmts 
such  breach.  If  six  or  more  parties  become  entitled  to  royalty  hereunder,  Lessee  may  withhold  payment  thereof  unless  and  until  furnished  with  a  recordable 
instrument  executed  by  all  such  parties  designating  an  agent  to  receive  payment  for  all. 

8  The  breach  by  Lessee  of  any  obligation  arising  hereunder  shall  not  work  a  forfeiture  or  termination  of  this  lease  nor  cause  a  termination  or 
reversion  of  the  estate  created  hereby  nor  be  grounds  for  cancellation  hereof  in  whole  or  in  part.  No  obligation  reasonably  to  develop  the  leased  premises 
shall  arise  during  the  primary  term.  Should  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities  be  discovered  on  said  premises,  then  after  the  exmmtion  of  the

acres  plus  an  acreage  tolerance  not  to  exceed  10%  of  640  acres  of  the  area  retained  hereunder  and  capable  of  producmg  gas  or  other  mineral  .n  paymg 
quantities.  If  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessor  considers  that  operations  are  not  at  anytime  being  conducted  in  compliance  with  this  lease, 
Lessor  shall  notify  Lessee  in  writing  of  the  facts  relied  upon  as  constituting  a  breach  hereof,  and  Ussee,  if  m  default,  shall  have  sixty  days  after  receipt  of 
such  notice  in  which  to  commence  the  compliance  with  the  obligations  imposed  by  virtue  of  this  instrument. 

9  Lessor  hereby  warrants  and  agrees  to  defend  the  title  to  said  land  and  agrees  that  Lessee  at  its  option  may  discharge  any  tax,  mortgage  or  other 
lien  upon  said  land,  either  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  in  event  Lessee  does  so,  it  shall  be  subrogated  to  such  lien  with  right  to  enforce  same  and .apply  royah.es 
a^u7ng  hereunder  toward  satisfying  same.  Without  impairment  of  Lessee's  rights  under  the  warranty  in  event  of  fa-lure  of  t.tle,  it  is  agreed  that  if  this  lease 
coTrs  a  less  interest  in  the  oil,  gas,  sulphur,  or  other  minerals  in  all  or  any  part  of  said  land  than  the  entire  and  undivided  fee  sunpk r  es  ate  (whether  Lesos

such  full  interest,  shall  be  paid  only  in  the  proportion  which  the  interest  therein,  if  any,  covered  by  this  lease  bears  to  the  whole  and I  undivided  fee  simple 
estate  therein  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whetheror  not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  Should  any  one  or 
more  of  the  parties  named  above  as  Lessors  £il  to  execute  this  lease,  it  shall  nevertheless  be  binding  upon  the  party  or  prties  executing  the  sane.
