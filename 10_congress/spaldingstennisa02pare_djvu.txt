SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  9 

Resume  of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Season  of  1916 

By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

The  United  States,  and  particularl.v  the  Eastern  section,  developed  into  the 
tennis  center  of  the  world  during  the  season  of  1916.  In  fact,  such  little  tennis 
was  played  elsewhere,  due  to  the  European  war,  and  reports  received  were  so 
meager,  that  results  elsewhere  can  be  practically  discarded,  so  far  as  value  for 
records  is  concerned. 

Two  features  combined  to  increase  the  interest  in  the  game  and  almost  bring 
back  the  halc.von  days  of  international  competition.  They  were  the  invasion 
of  our  big  tournaments  by  Ichiya  Kumagae  and  Hachishlro  Mikami,  the  two 
experts  from  Japan,  and  the  increased  number  of  Pacific  Coast  players  visiting 
the   East. 

Though  eliminated  in  the  early  rounds  in  the  National  Championship,  Kumagae 
left  behind  him  a  very  enviable  record,  in  fact,  almost  a  phenomenal  one.  When 
it  is  considered  that  it  was  his  lirst  season  on  turf  courts,  his  first  experience 
against  the  aggressive  type  of  net  play  and  the  utterly  strange  conditions  and 
surroundings,  too  much  credit  can  hardly  be  given  him.  Not  only  that,  but 
he  conclusively  proved  to  us  that  the  type  of  game  which  he  used  and  which 
we  in  the  United  States  had  concluded  was  practically  obsolete  was  still  to 
be  reckoned  with  seriously.  For  a  confirmed  baseline  player  to  carry  away  the 
scalps  of  our,  at  that  time,  national  champion,  .Johnston,  and  doubles  champion. 
Griffin,  to  sa.v  notliing  of  a  host  of  others,  speaks  for  itself. 

At  first  glance  even  an  expert  would  find  but  little  to  admire  about  his  game, 
but  thoroughly  analyzing  it,  he  would  find  it  growing  on  one,  until  finally  a 
sincere  respect,  if  not  admiration,  would  be  instilled.  Like  all  his  countrymen, 
tenacity  of  purpose  and  inexhaustible  patience  were  his  most  apparent  char- 
acteristics, and  only  once  throughout  his  visit  to  the  United  States  did  be  seem 
to  l)e  completely  at  sea.  This  was  in  his  match  against  George  M.  Church  in  the 
National  Championships  and  was  due  to  the  style  of  game  he  was  playing 
against.  Undoubtedly,  though  hardly  to  be  considered  a  second  choice  in  the 
national  ranking,  he  deserves  to  share  the  honors,  in  a  season  replete  with 
unexpected  and  sensational  surprises,  with  National  Champion  Richard  Norris 
Williams.  2nd. 

Mikami,  Kumagae's  partner,  though  hardly  in  the  same  class,  gave  a  good 
account  of  himself.  As  a  doubles  team  they  both  showed  they  had  a  great  deal 
to  learn  and  their  baseline  game  was  not  adapted  to  it. 

The  Pacific  Coast  invasion,  though  in  point  of  numbers  and  on  paper  the 
most  formidable  ever  undertaken,  was  not  so  successful  as  heretofore.  Johnston, 
Murray.  Griffln.  Davis  and  Roberts  were  signally  defeated  by  Williams,  Wash- 
burn, Church,  Behr  and  Niles  in  all  five  matches  in  the  East- West  contest,  at 
the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  Forest  Hills,  L.  I.,  in  August,  and  the  only  point 
they  scored  was  one  of  the  two  doubles  matches,  Johnston  and  Griffln  earning 
their  tie  against  Behr  and  Alexander.  Williams  and  Church  nosed  out  a  five- 
set  victory  from  Murray  and  Davis.  Six  matches  to  one  looks,  on  paper,  rather 
overwhelming,  but  it  can  be  deduced  that  had  a  match  been  played  in  the  West 
on  asphalt  courts  the  result  might  easily  have  been  reversed. 

Williams  brought  back  the  national  championship  in  singles  to  the  East,  and 
despite  two  defeats  b,v  Griffln,  who  seems  to  be  his  b(^te  noir  of  the  tennis  courts, 
easily  carried  away  the  best  record.  His  two  defeats  of  Johnston,  one  in  the 
East-West  and  the  other  in  the  final  match  for  the  championship,  were  flve-set 
matches,    but    well    earned. 

As  a  team  Johnston  and  Griffin  were  still  the  premier  doubles  combination  of 
the  country,  going  through  the  season  with  but  one  defeat,  and  that  in  the 
Newport  invitation  by  an  eleventh-hour  combination  of  Wallace  Johnson  and 
Joseph    .T.   Armstrong. 

Johnston  undoubtedly  showed  the  most  scientific  hard-hitting  tennis  since 
the  McLoughlin-Brookes  contests  of  1914  in  his  matches  against  Nathaniel  W. 
Niles  and  R.  I..indley  Murray,  fairly  smothering  them,  and  it  is  all  the  more 
to  Williams'  credit  that  he  was  able  to  win  when  Johnston  was  at  the  top 
of    his    game. 

Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  fell  well  behind  his  form  of  the  year  before,  due 
mostly  to  lack  of  practise.  His  only  singles  in  the  East  were  played  in  the 
national  championships,  where  he  won  from  T.  R.  Pell  handily,  only  to  go 
down  to  defeat  before  George  M.  Church  in  the  next  round.  With  the  exception 
of  a  flash  of  his  former  invincible  style  every  now  and  then,  which  he  seemed

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  11 

only  to  be  able  to  hold  for  three  or  four  games,  his  play  was  distinctly  lethargic, 
and  even  his  great  service  and  overhead  work  wore  hardly  impressive. 

R.  Lindley  Murray  celebrated  his  return  to  Eastern  tennis  after  a  year's 
absence  by  showing  a  distinct  improvement.  Though  still  depending  largely 
on  his  remarkable  court-covering  ability,  his  strokes  showed  a  greater  smooth- 
ness and  no  longer  seemed  crude  to  the  onlooker.  His  net  game  and  service 
were  as  good  as  ever.  With  wins  over  Church,  Kumagae,  Behr  and  many  lesser 
lights,   his   record   for  1916  was  an   enviable  one. 

George  M.  Church  started  the  season  with  the  avowed  intention  of  wiping 
out  his  somewhat  erratic  record  of  the  year  before.  He  rapidly  rounded  into 
form  and,  with  the  exception  of  his  defeat  at  the  hands  of  Conrad  B.  Doyle 
in  the  chiy  court  championships,  held  it  throughout  the  season.  His  five-set 
match  with  Williams  in  the  finals  at  Seabright,  his  defeat  of  Murray  in  the 
same  tournament,  and  his  wins  over  Kumagae  and  McLoughlin  in  the  national, 
were  all  good  pieces  of  work.  Especially  meritorious  was  the  overwhelming  of 
Kumagae  in  straight  sots.  The  luck  of  the  draw,  which  bunched  five  serious 
contenders  for  the  title  in  the  third  quarter,  which  quickly  got  the  name  of 
the  "death  cell,"  was,  perhaps,  responsible  for  his  not  getting  further ;  the 
wear  and  tear  of  one  hard  match  after  the  other  undoubtedly  had  its  effect 
on   both   physique  and   nerves. 

Of  the  Western  contingent,  as  also  the  Eastern,  Clarence  J.  Griffin  stood 
head  and  shoulders  above  the  others  as  a  doubles  player.  He  bad  the  unusual 
record  also  of  defeating  Champion  Williams  twice  in  singles.  Defeats  at  the 
hands  of  Kumagae  and  others,  however,  spoiled  an  otherwise  good  record. 

Karl  II.  Behr's  tennis  during  the  summer  was  both  good  and  bad,  and  at 
times  indifferent.  Lack  of  practise  handicapped  him  severely.  His  best  singles 
match  was  against  R.  Lindley  Murray  and,  though  defeated  in  four  close 
sets,   there   was   but   little  difference   between   the   two. 

Watson  M.  Washburn,  after  a  disastrous  start,  came  out  better  than  expected 
and  showed  some  clever  play  toward  the  end  of  the  season.  Exactly  opposite 
was  the  case  of  Willis  E.  Davis,  the  Calif ornian,  who  started  off  with  flying 
colors,  winning  the  Sleepy  Hollow  invitation  tournament  and  the  clay  court 
championship,  but  losing  to  Washburn  in  the  national.  Pell,  Niles  and  Hall 
(ranked  respectively  in  1915,  fifth,  sixth  and  tenth)  all  fell  behind  previous 
work  ;  in  fact,  1916  saw  the  passing  of  the  old  guard  from  the  first  ten  and 
marked   the  rise  of  the  new  generation  of  players. 

Among  the  younger  element,  Harold  A.  Throckmorton  of  the  East  and  Roland 
Roberts  of  the  West  stood  out  above  the  rest.  The  experiment  of  running 
the  .iunior  tournaments  in  sections,  as  the  championship  doubles  are  played, 
foun<l  these  two  players  in  the  finals,  and  Throckmorton  placed  a  good  match 
to  his  credit  in  three  hard,  straight  sets,  winning  the  new  title  of  National 
Junior  Champion.  Benjamin  Letson  of  New  York  won  the  first  boys'  champion- 
ship played  under  the  same  conditions.  The  remarkable  interest  shown  in 
these  two  branches  of  the  sport  t^roved  conclusively  that  the  experiment  was  a 
success. 

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt  completely  outclassed  the  field  in  the  women's  events  and 
won  as  she  pleased.  Tennis  among  the  fair  sex  increased  greatly  in  popu- 
larity and  the  entries  were  more  numerous  in  the  different  tournaments  than 
ever"  before.  An  exhibition  tour  by  Misses  Bjurstedt  and  Ballin  undoubtedly 
added  much  to  the  popularity  of  the  game. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  13 

National   Championships 

By    F.    B.    ALEXANDER. 

Rain  was  a  fl'sturbing  feature  of  the  first  day  of  the  National  Cham- 
pionships at  Forest  Hills,  Long  Island,  Monday,  August  28,  1916,  four 
singles  being  tlie  extent  of  the  play.  William  M.  Johnston  vanquished 
Howard  Notman.  Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  defeated  R.  B.  McClave,  while 
Clarence  .T.  Griffin  and  E.  H.  Whitney  triumphed  over  F.  C.  Baggs  and 
Ward    riawson,    respectively. 

Dry,  fast  courts  greeted  the  contestants  on  the  second  scheduled  day  of 
the  championships,  althoigh  in  reality  it  might  have  been  called  the  start. 
In  the  singles  some  of  the  more  important  matches — at  least  from  the 
reputation  of  one.  if  not  both,  of  the  players  contesting — were  the  victories 
of  R.  Norris  Williams,  I'd.  over  Jerry  Weber  of  Chicago,  W.  J.  Clothier  over 
Hachishiro  Mikami,  the  Japanese,  and  A.  W.  Macpherson,  the  Russian  cham- 
pion with  the  Scotch  name,  over  F.  C.  Inman  ;  other  prominent  winners  being 
T.  R.  Pell,  ruorse  M.  Church,  Uean  Mathey,  Karl  Behr  and  W.  M.  Wash- 
burn. The  Behr-r>oyle  contest  was  a  stubborn  battle  and  to  those  unfamiliar 
with  the  Washingtonian's  style,  Behr's  apparent  misses  were  inexplicable. 
The  knowing  ones,  however,  realized  th^  task  the  New  York  player  had.  the 
final  score  being  2/6.2/6,6/2,6/4,0/4.  Some  other  matches  were  also  stretched 
to  a  longer  conclusion,  notablv  that  of  Robert  LeRoy,  who  defeated  L. 
Vandeventer,  6/8,6/3.6/2,2/6.6/1 ;  P.  Vandeventer  defeated  C.  S.  Rogers.  4/6,

defeated  O.  King,   l/6,7/.5.4/6.6/4.6/2. 

The  doubles  event  was  the  feature  of  the  bill,  however,  nearly  8,000  spec- 
tators being  attracted  to  the  tournament  by  the  prospect  of  championship 
tennis,  which,  however,  was  exclusivelv  of  a"  Pacific  Coast  brand,  the  cham- 
pions. W.  M.  .Johnston  and  C.  J.  Griffin,  defending  their  title  against  the 
challengers.  Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  and  Ward  Dawson.  The  first  two  sets 
were  rather  a  disappointment  to  those  who  had  expected  to  see  a  stirring 
battle  waged  right  from  the  start,  but  the  third  set  was  an  entirely  different 
matter,  McLoughlin  and  Dawson  giving  splendid  exhibitions  of  skill.  With  a 
rest  between  the  third  and  fourth  sets,  the  champions  put  renewed  vigor 
into  their  attack,  and.  despite  brilliant  work  by  McLoughlin  and  Dawson, 
won  the  match  and  retained   the  national  doubles  title.   6/4.6/3, .5/7, 6/3. 

With  the  doubles  tide  no  longer  in  doubt  the  attention  of  the  crowd  on 
the  third  day  was  centered  on  the  singles  eliminations,  with  the  point  of 
focus  on  the  little  Japanese,  Ichiya  Kumagae.  who  had  been  upsetting  all 
predictions  since  his  arrival  earlier  in  the  season.  George  M.  Church,  his 
antithesis  in  physique  and  style,  was  the  Oriental  player's  opponent  and  he 
smashed  his  way  to  victory  in  straight  sets,  although  the  score,  6/3.6/3,6/1, 
does  not  express  what  may  possibly  be  explained  better  by  the  summary  :

Of  the  other  matches  T.  R.  Pell,  with  his  famous  backhand  going  good, 
disposed  of  F.  B.  Alexander.  The  principal  feature  of  the  Mathey-MacPherson 
contest  was  endurance,  nearly  three  hours  being  consumed  before  the  Prince- 
ton plaver  won.  McLoughlin  put  out  his  erstwhile  pupil,  Kenneth  Hawks, 
while  Harold  Throckmorton's  game  showed  a  slump  in  his  match  with  his 
chum,  Leonard  Beekman.  Williams  and  LeRoy  came  together,  the  champion 
giving  a  most  impressive  exhibition. 

With  the  field  now  narrowed  to  sixteen  contestants,  speculation  was  rife 
as  to  the  probable  winner,  and.  basing  their  hopes  on  the  game  McLoughlin 
showed  against  Pell,  some  even  thought  that  he  had  a  chance  for  the  title. 
The  Californian,  while  superior  to  Pell,  did  not  exhibit  any  brilliancy  as  com-

pared  to  wh.at  he  was  wont  to  do  in  other  years  and  won  what  might  be 
called  an  uninterostins  match.  The  host  tennis  of  the  day  was  shown  by 
Johnston  arid  Nilos,  with  Johnston  apparently  conserving  his  strength  for 
future  struggles.  S.  Howard  Voshell  and  Wallace  F.  Johnson  went  five  sets, 
f>/8.;V6,6/2.9/7.6/.'5,  before  the  latter  won,  although  it  must  be  mentioned 
that  a  good  sized  ".iinx"  seemed  to  be  working  against  the  Brooklyn  player. 
In  the  fourth  set,  leading  at  7 — 6  and  40. — 15,  a  net  cord  ball  tantalizingly 
balanced  itself,  finally  electing  to  drop  on  Voshell's  side,  "with  Sheridan 
twenty  miles  away."  The  headliners  were  continuing  their  victorious  march 
on  other  courts.  George  M.  Church  defeated  the  Californian  player,  P^ugene 
Warren.  W.  M.  Washburn  eliminated  Dean  Mathey,  Williams  disposed  of 
Cedrif  Major,  Clarence  Griffin  conquered  William  Kand,  and  Merrill  Uall  won 
fron    Alrick  H.  Man,  Jr. 

Friday's  play  had  brought  together  Maurice  McLoughlin  and  George  M. 
Church,  along  with  other  expected  choice  competition,  and  with  it  a  large 
crowd,  many  of  whom  were  attracted  by  the  reported  "comeback"  of  the  ever 
popular  McLoughlin  and  all  keyed  up  with  expectation.  Mac  won  the  first 
set  and  thrilled  his  admirers  with  the  hope  that  the  reports  they  had 
heard  of  his  possibility  of  regaining  his  title  were  true.  Church,  with 
McLoughlin's  own  style  game,  was  not  to  be  denied,  however,  and  though 
the  "Comet"  gave  many  evidences  of  his  former  prowess,  the  Easterner  took 
three  straight  sets.     Summaries  :

Clothier  and  Williams,  both  ex-champions,  came  together,  the  former 
winning  the  first  set,  with  a  look-in  at  the  second,  but  the  more  youthful 
Williams  asserted  his  superiority  and  won,  5/7,7/5,6/4,6/1.  W.  M.  Wash- 
burn defeated  W.  E.  Davis  ;  R.  Lindley  Murray  and  Karl  Behr  had  a  typical 
tussle  in  which  honors  were  even.  Murray  managing  to  pull  through ; 
Clarence  Griffin  almost  succumbed  to  "Ted"  Whitney,  the  former  Harvard 
captain :  Johnston  kept  up  his  consistent  play  and  lowered  the  colors  of 
the  Princeton  leader,  Leonard  Beekman.  while  Wallace  Johnson  put  away 
Walt(-r  Merrill  Hall,  and  Douglas  Watters  of  New  Orleans  performed  the 
same  rites  for  E.  R.  McCormick  of  California. 

Saturday's  contest  par  excellence  was  the  Church-Murray  dueL  It  was 
one  of  the  bi.ggest  reversals  of  the  tournament  and  a  complete  surprise  to 
those  who  had  been  following  the  play  during  the  week.  Murray's  powerful 
service,  combined  with  exhaustion  on  the  part  of  Church,  made  for  the 
defeat  of  the  young  Eastern  representative,  who  had  started  off  blithely 
enough  liy  winning  the  first  two  sets,  and  although  he  made  a  game  rally  in 
the  fifth  set,  Murray  came  through  with  the  victory,  3/6,4/6,6/2,6/4,6/4. 

The  winners  in  the  other  matches  were :  R.  Norris  Williams,  2d,  who 
defeated  Douglas  S.  Watters,  after  losing  one  set:  Clarence  J.  Griffin,  who 
triumphed  over  Wallace  F.  Johnson,  and  William  M.  Johnston,  whose 
opponent  was  Watson  M.  Washburn. 

The  combination  of  a  holiday — Labor  Da.v — perfect  weather  and  prospects 
of  championship  tennis  was  sufficient  to  pack  the  stands  and  every  available 
point  of  view,  over  10,000  spectators  making  the  trip  to  the  Forest  Hills 
courts.  While  the  results  of  the  two  matches  were  pretty  well  forecasted, 
neverth(>less  the  exhibitions  were  of  a  nature  that  were  thrilling  to  every 
follower  of  the  sport.  Both  Williams  and  Johnston  seemed  to  be  electrified 
with  the  spirit  of  the  occasion  and  repeatedly  ran  to  heights  that  were  most 
spectacular,  foreshadowing  whnt  might  be  expected  when  they  met  in  the 
final  clash  on  the  morrow.  Both  Murray,  against  Johnston,  and  Griffin, 
against  Williams,  gave  good  accounts  of  themselves,  but  it  was  never  a 
question  as  to  who  would  be  the  eventual  winner. 

The  final  day  of  the  tournament  found  the  world  of  sport  on  the  qui  vive 
as  to  the  outcome  of  the  meeting  between  champion  and  ex-champion — 
whether  the  holder  would  retain  his  title  or  the  former  champion  regain 
his   laurels.      In   addition,    the   sectional   aspect   also   added   interest,   so   that

for  the  time  being  the  event  even  transcended  in  interest,  for  the  golfer,  the 
probable  outcome  of  the  amateur  championship,  then  being  played  over  the 
Merlon  course,  or  for  the  base  ball  fan,  the  possibility  of  the  Giants  winning  the 
pennant. 

And  those  who  journeyed  out  to  see  the  contest  suffered  no  disappointment 
Both  players  acquitted  themselves  with  slsill  and  courage  and  the  contest  resolved 
itself  into  a  series  of  tennis  tableaux  that  moved  with  lightning  rapidity  and 
showed  at  successive  intervals  play  that  can  be  only  classed  as  super-tennis,  the 
figures  of  the  Ave  sets  being  totally  unable  to  afford  to  those  not  present  any 
idea  of  the  intensity  of  the  struggle  and  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the  tide  of  victory 
as  first  one  and  then  the  other  forged  ahead. 

The  first  set  was  Johnston's,  and  the  second  started  off  as  if,  too,  it  might  he, 
but  Williams  reversed  the  result.  In  the  third  set  Johnston's  skill  was  very 
much  in  evidence  and  he  seemed  invulnerable.  The  fourth  set,  after  an  interval 
of  seven  minutes'  rost.  found  a  different  condition  of  affairs.  Williams  seemed 
to  be  wonderfullv  refreshed,  while  it  was  apparent  that  Johnston  was  beginning 
to  tire.  The  fifth  set  was  a  desperate  effort  on  the  part  of  Johnston  to  retrieve 
himself,  but  try  as  he  might,  the  end  was  in  sight  and  the  contest  closed  with, 
the  national  championship  once  more  in  Eastern  possession.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  23 

Impressions  o£   the   National  Championships 

Bv  Edwakd  C.  Coxlin,  Chairman  National  Umpibes'  Association. 

The  thirty-sixth  National  Lawn  Tennis  Championships  gave  to  the  tennis 
world  a  match  that  all  followers  of  tenuis  will  remember  for  many  years  to 
come.  For  one  hour  and  forty-seven  minutes  i{ichard  Norris  Williams,  2d,  of 
Boston,  Mass.,  and  William  M.  .Johnston  of  San  Francisco,  Cal.,  gave  an  exhibi- 
tion that  only  one  word  will  describe — wonderful.  And  when  the  match  was 
finished  I  doubt  if  there  was  in  the  gallery  or  enclosure  a  follower  of  any 
sport  who  was  not  glad  that  it  was  over,  for  there  is  a  limit  to  the  strain  that 
human  nerves  can  stand.     I  know  ;  I  umpired  the  match. 

On  Tuesday  afternoon,  September  5,  1916  (that  is  when  the  match  took  place), 
Williams  was  the  best  tennis  player  we  had  in  America.  He  showed  to  me 
everything  I  have  ever  seen  on  a  tennis  court,  and  he  had  most  of  them  on 
a  100  per  cent  basis.  I  doubt  if  there  was  a  moment  during  the  entire  match 
that  he  was  not  absolutely  confident  of  winning  the  championship  ;  and  when 
.Tohnston  took  the  third  set  at  G/0,  I  felt  sure  that  Williams  would  win.  I 
have  watched  him  in  many  an  important  match,  and  he  is  an  easier  man  to 
defeat  when  he  is  ahead  than  when  he  is  behind. 

Johnston  played  well — not  quite  as  well  as  when  he  played  Murray,  for  his 
match  with  Murray  seemed  to  me  his  best  in  the  tournament,  and  "Billy"  gave 
an  exhibition  of  gameness  and  sportsmanship  that  was  thrilling  to  witness.  I 
think  Williams  had  a  little  on  him  in  condition.  Both  men  gave  an  exhibition 
of  shots  not  to  be  chased  that  showed  the  perfection  to  which  they  have  brought 
their  game  in  a  department  to  which  both  Murray  and  Church  would  do  well  to 
give  attention. 

The  condition  of  the  turf  on  the  court  after  the  match  was  interesting  to  me. 
Johnston  does  not  tear  the  turf,  Williams  does.  The  court  was  not  marl<ed 
inside  of  the  service  line,  though  it  showed  plainly  the  wear  right  up  to  the 
service  line.  This  condition  indicated  that  Williams  came  to  the  service  line 
but  not  inside  of  it,  and  I  have  always  understood  that  this  was  an  untenable 
position  in  tennis.     But  Williams  did  it,  and  he  won. 

An  incident  after  the  match  that  shows  the  kind  of  stuff  the  champion 
is  made  of  might  well  b(>  mentioned  here  :  .Johnston  was  completely  out  at  the 
finish  of  the  match  ;  he  could  not  see  the  ball  during  the  last  two  points,  and 
it  took  him  a  few  minutes  to  recover  sufficiently  to  feel  able  to  walk  out  of  the 
championship  enclosure.  Williams  was  in  good  shape  at  the  finish.  "Dick''  well 
knew  that  if  he  walked  off  the  court  alone  he  would  receive  the  ovation  the 
gallery  was  waiting  to  give  him.  Did  he  do  it?  He  did  not.  lie  waited  until 
Johnston  had  fully  recovered,  and  walked  off  the  court  with  him,  sharing  with 
the  man  lie  had  defeated  the  big  gallery's  tribute  of  applause  that  might  have 
been  his  alone. 

Church  b(>at  Ichiya  Kumagae  of  Japan  in  a  match  that  was  not  easy,  and 
if  the  game  the  latter  showed  us  is  a  fair  sample  of  the  tennis  that  is  being 
played  liy  the  best  men  in  Japan,  we  have  something  to  think  about  when  the 
Pavis  Cup  again  comes  up  for  discussion.  Had  Kumagae  a  better  service  and  a 
knowledge  of  the  net  game,  he  would  have  taken  a  lot  of  beating  before  the 
national  championship  could  have  been  kept  in  the  United  States.  I  heard  a 
man  say  once  that  the  net  game  was  a  "juggling  game."  Well,  Japan  is  a 
nation   of  jugglers. 

C.  .T.  Griffin  reached  the  semi-finals  because  E.  H.  Whitney  did  not  win  the 
fourth  set  of  theii'  match,  which  was  played  on  the  morning  of  the  fourth  day 
in  a  temperature  that  was  high  enough  to  kill  both  of  them.  Griffin  managed 
to  stagger  through  the  twenty-second  game  of  the  fourth  set.  and  thereby  won 
the  match,  but  he  was  goinir  almost  as  fast  as  Whitney  was  coming  and  if 
he  had  dropped  that  set,  Whitney  would  have  won  the  match.  Griffin's  singles 
play  is  not  improving,  but  he  is  one  of  the  best  doubles  players  we  have. 

R.  Lindley  Murray  defeated  George  M.  Church  on  Labor  Day  before  a  holiday 
crowd.  Murray  lost  the  first  two  sets  and  the  gallery  looked  upon  him  as  the 
"under  dog."  But  in  the  third  set  he  began  to  pull  up  and  the  gallery  rooted 
for  him  far  beyond  reason,  and  to  an  extent,  indeed,  that  unfairly  hurt  Church's 
game.  This,  with  considerable  foot-faulting,  perhaps  cost  Church  the  match, 
but  Church  would  never  have  got  by  Johnston  the  next  day. 

"The  defeat  of  M.  E.  McLouehlin  by  Church  carried  with  it  feeling  of  sincere 
regret   to   all   the   tennis  world,    in   that   it   showed   what   a   great   many    clos^

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  25 

observers  had  feared,  that  McLoughlin  had  "burned  out"  his  speed  and  was  no 
longer  the  contender  for  championship  honors  that  he  once  was.  No  man  ever 
brought  more  to  tennis  the  world  over  than  "Maurie"  McLoughlin,  and  he  gave 
his  all  in  placing  the  United  States  in  the  position  we  hold  among  tennis  playing 
nations. 

The  play  of  Williams  and  Johnston  throughout  the  tournament  left  no  doubt 
as  to  their  superiority  over  the  other  126  entries,  but  there  were  at  least 
twenty  mfire  men  whose  play  was  of  such  expert  character  that  a  very  high 
standard  of  tennis  was  maintained  during  the  whole  tournament. 

Harold  A.  Throckmorton  of  Plainfleld,  N.  .T..  played  a  most  excellent  match 
asninst  Roland  Roberts  of  San  Francisco,  Cal.,  in  winning  the  junior  cham- 
jiionship.  which  was  up  for  the  first  time.  He  had  plenty  of  speed,  served 
forcefully  and  well,  and  hit  the  ball  hard  at  all  times.  Throckmorton  was 
unfortu!)ate  in  the  national  singles  in  meeting  his  chum,  Leonard  Beekman,  in 
the  second  round.  Bookman  has  some  sort  of  an  Indian  sign  on  Throckmorton 
and   always    defeats   him,    despite  Throckmorton's   superior    game. 

Roland  Roberts  was  a  disappointment  to  me  in  the  nationals.  I  umpired  his 
match  against  Williams  of  Newport  and  he  was  very  good  in  all  departments. 
He  sorvos  well,  keeps  the  ball  well  placed,  and  drives  very  hard  from  his  fore- 
hand. At  Forest  Hills  he  seemed  to  me  to  be  stale  and  off  his  game ;  but  he 
will  bear  watching. 

Watson  M.  Washburn  is  a  puzzle  to  me.  He  seems  slow,  yet  there  are  very 
few  shots  within  possible  reach  that  go  by  him.  His  strokes  appear  to  lack 
pace,  yet  the  men  who  play  against  him  say  the  ball  comes  very  hard,  and  every 
year  lie  is  ranked  higher.     That's  enough. 

Conrad  P..  Doyle  of  Wa.shington.  D.  C,  who  had  not  played  in  a  national 
championship  in  several  years,  made  a  highly  favorable  impression,  and  his 
match  against  Karl  H.  Bohr  was  a  fine  one  to  watch.  He  is  better  on  clay, 
I)ut  one  of  the  best  players  in  the  East  today. 

Richard  Harte  of  Harvard  University  was  Williams'  partner  in  the  final  of 
the  <loubles  at  Southampton.  They  were  defeated  by  Johnston,  and  Griffin,  the 
national  champions,  and  needless  to  say,  the  latter  team  gave  Harte  plenty  to 
do.  In  watching  him  that  afternoon  one  could  not  help  but  be  impressed  with 
the  fact  that  he  has  the  makings  of  a  great  tennis  player.  In  many  ways  ho 
reminds  you  of  the  McLoughlin  we  first  saw  in  the  East.  He  is  a  wonderful 
athlete,  and  has  a  most  pleasing  personality.  At  the  present  time  I  understand 
he  is  driving  an  ambulance  somewhere  in  France.  I  hope  he  comes  back  and 
plays  serious  tennis,  for  I  feel  sure  ho  will  go  far.  In  the  national  this 
yoar  he  did  not  do  himself  justice,  going  out  in  the  second  round. 

Willis  E.  Davis,  of  California,  would  easily  have  won  first  prize  for  speed 
in  service  had  there  been  one.  He  gets  considerable  twist  with  his  great  speed 
and  volleys  well,  l)ut  is  not  good  off  the  ground.  He  came  through  to  the 
fourth  round,  defeating  such  good  men  as  Roland  Roberts  and  B.  S.  Prentice 
on  the  way.  Against  Washburn  it  was  a  different  story  ;  "Waddie"  knows  too 
much  tennis  for  Davis  at  present.  Davis  has  a  fine  physique,  but  was  some- 
what stale  toward  the  latter  part  of  the  season. 

Karl  H.  Behr  of  Now  York,  one  of  the  most  popular  tournament  players  in 
.\merican  tennis  and  a  man  who  gets  more  laughs  out  of  his  matches  than  all 
the  other  to\irnament  players  combined,  gave  to  the  national  one  of  its  best 
matches  in  defeating  Conrad  B.  Doyle  in  the  first  round.  It  was  a  fine  match 
for  the  gallery  to  watch,  and  they  thoroughly  enjoyed  it.  Behr  lost  to  Murra.v 
in  the  fourth  round,  the  latter  playing  very  well,  his  service  and  volleying  being 
especially  good.     This  also  was  an  interesting  match. 

The  challenge  match  for  the  doubles  championship  was  played  on  the  second 
day,  Johnston  and  Griffin  defending  against  McLoughlin  and  Ward  Dawson. 
It  was  a  match  that  defied  description — the  poorest  for  the  championship  that  I 
have  ever  seen. 

The  tournament  was  perfectly  managed  and  all  praise  and  credit  should  be 
piven  to  (Jeorge  T.  Adee,  the  president  of  the  U.  S.  L.  T.  A.,  and  Julian  S. 
Myrick,  the  president  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club.  The  large  galleries  that 
watch  and  enjoy  these  matches  under  ideal  conditions,  seldom  see  the  men  who 
■work  so  hard  to  make  everything  run  like  clockwork.  Seated  at  a  table  on 
the  clubhouse  t(>rrace,  with  telephones  at  their  elbows,  watching  every  detail 
and  directing  their  scores  of  assistants,  these  two  men  put  in  a  week's  work 
that  makes  the  competitors'  i)art  seem  comparatively  small.  And  it  is  their 
love  of  the  sport  that  makes  them  do  it.     All  hats  oft"  to  them. 

It  was  a  great  championship  and  a  wonderful  final.

East  vs.  West  Team  Matches 


First  Series — August,   1916 

The  first  of  the  intersectional  series  between  the  East  and  West  in  1916,  played 
at  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  Forest  Hills,  N.  Y.,  August  4  and  5,  resulted  in  an. 
overwhelming  and  totally  unexpected  victory  for  the  East,  the  West  winning  only 
one  of  the  seven  matches.  The  East  made  a  clean  sweep  of  the  singles,  whereas  it 
■was  regarded  as  having  only  one  match  cinched — that  between  Karl  H.  Behr  and 
Willis  E.  Davis.  It  was  generally  thought,  however,  that  George  M.  Church  had 
the  hotter  of  it  against  Griffin. 

The  first  match  was  between  Church  and  Clarence  J.  Griffin.  The  former 
was  at  the  top  of  his  game  and  there  never  was  a  doubt  of  the  result.  Only  in 
the  first  set  did  Griffin  make  a  real  fight,  and  in  that,  as  in  the  subsequent  sets, 
Church  captured  his  opponent's  service  and  thereafter  had  only  to  win  his  own. 

Then  came  a  sensational  match  between  Watson  M.  Washburn,  representing  the 
East,  and  R.  Lindley  Murray,  the  West.  The  result  completely  upset  the  "dope" 
and  'eft  the  West  in  a  bad  way.  Murray  looked  allover  a  winner  after  taking  the 
firsi  two  sets.  In  the  third  set  Washburn  got  command  of  himself  and  he  won, 
6/4.  He  also  won  the  fourth  set,  losing  but  one  game.  At  this  point  Murray,  who 
had  been  staggering  all  over  the  court  in  his  rushes  to  the  net,  almost  collapsed. 
In  the  fifth  set,  when  the  score  stood  2-all,  Referee  Wrenn  stopped  play  and  talked 
to  Murray,  but  he  refused  to  quit.  Finally,  Captain  Johnston  of  the  Western 
team  defaulted  the  match  to  Washburn. 

With  the  East  leading  unexpectedly,  two  matches  to  nothing,  the  feature  con- 
test of  the  series  between  R.  Norris  Williams.  2nd,  and  William  M.  Johnston, 
champions  of  1914  and  1915,  respectively,  was  begun  late  in  the  afternoon. 
They  fought  it  out  doggedly  for  five  sets,  Williams  being  the  victor.  According 
to  experts,  such  hard  and  well  directed  hitting,  such  lightning-fast  rallies,  such 
audacity  mingled  with  finesse,  such  complete  possession  of  every  weapon  in  the 
tennis  player's  repertoire,  such  aggressive  tactics  and  consummate  strategy,  as 
was  shown  in  the  first  four  sets  has  rarel.v,  if  ever,  been  seen.  While  this 
match  was  going  on,  Behr  and  Davis  were  having  it  out  on  another  court,  but 
Behr  had  everything  his  own  way  and  won  easily. 

Saturday,  the  last  day,  included  one  singles  and  two  doubles  matches.  Nathan- 
iel W.  Xiles  and  Roland  Roberts  faced  each  other  in  the  singles,  but  the  young 
Californian  at  times  was  quite  overmatched,  Niles  getting  the  verdict  in  three 
straight  sets.  The  first  doubles  match  brought  out  .Alexander  and  Behr  against 
Johnston  and  Griffin.  The  former,  although  winning  the  first  set.  did  not  make 
much  of  a  stand  against  the  champions.  The  other  doubles  match — -Williams  and 
Church  versus  Davis  and  Murray — was  all  fireworks.  The  match  went  to  five 
sets,  Williams  and  Church  always  leading  and  winning  comfortably  in  the  end.

Second  Series — March,  1917 

By  six  matches  to  one  the  Western  team  defeated  the  East  on  a  specially 
prepared  asphalt  court  at  Bovard  Field,  University  of  Southern  California,  in  a 
return  match  which  began  March  7.  While  it  was  fully  expected  that  the  West 
would  win,  the  overwhelming  victory  was  more  than  was  looked  for.  Only  one 
match  was  won  by  the  East,  that  honor  falling  to  Fred  B.  Alexander  and  C.  B. 
Doyle.  In  addition  there  was  a  round-robin  for  women,  in  which  Mrs.  May 
Sutton  Bundy,  Miss  Molla  B.iurstcdt  and  Miss  Mary  K.  Browne  participated, 
end    two    mixed    doubles    exhibitions.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  29 

California  won  the  inaugural  event  of  the  series,  a  doubles  match  between 
Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  and  Willis  E.  Davis  against  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell  and 
Bemon  S.  Prentice  of  New  Yorlc.  The  former  pair  triumphed  because  of 
McLoughlin's  superiority.  The  East  fared  better  in  a  mixed  doubles  exhibition, 
Mis.s  Molla  B.iurstedt  and  George  M.  Church  winning  from  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Thomas 
C.  Bund.v  with  ease.  G/2,6/1.'.  The  day's  proceedings  closed  with  a  singles  exhi- 
bition,   in    which    William    M.    Johnston    defeated    John  Strachan,  6/3,6/1. 

On  the  second  da.v,  Conrad  B.  Uojie  of  Washington,  D.  C,  lost  to  Willis  E. 
Davis,  6/1,4/0,8/0,6/1,  then  followed  a  doubles  match  between  George  M.  Church 
and  Harold  A.  Throclcmorton,  representing  the  East,  and  William  M.  Johnston 
and  John  Strachan,  the  West.  The  Eastern  team  lost  the  first  set,  4/6,  but  won 
the  next  two,  6/4.0/4.  With  the  score  a  tie  at  7-all  in  the  fourth  set  the  match 
was  postponed  on  account  of  dariiuess.  Play  was  resumed  two  days  later  and 
the  Californiaus  won  the  fourth  set,  13/11,  and  the  decisive  set,  0/4.  Before 
the  doul)l('S  match  was  called  an  exhibition  in  singles  was  played  between  Mrs. 
Bundy  and  Miss  Mary  Browne.  The  former  won  in  a  long  contest  replete  with 
flashing  rallies,  11/0,6/3. 

Unfavorable  weather  prevented  any  play  on  the  third  day,  but  on  Saturday, 
March  10,  the  contestants  put  in  a  busy  day.  Besides  the  completion  of  the 
unfinished  doubles  match  of  Thursday,  another  doubles  affair  was  decided,  Fred 
B.  Alexander  and  Conral  B.  Doyle  defeating  Claude  A.  Wayne  and  Nat  B. 
Browne,  6/3,10/8,7/5,  thus  giving  to  the  Eastern  team  what  proved  to  be  the 
only  victory  of  the  series.  The  feature  of  the  day  was  a  singles  match  between 
William  M.  Johnston  and  George  M.  Church,  the  Californian  winning,  6/1,6/3, 
3/6,6/1.  The  East  also  lost  another  singles  match,  John  Strachan  winning  from 
Theodore  R.  Pell.  3/6,6/2,7/5,6/2. 

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt,  national  champion  on  turf,  clay  and  indoor  courts  was 
defeated  by  Mrs.  Bundy,  7/5,9/7.  The  victory  gave  the  trophy  to  Mrs.  Bundy 
in  the  women's  round-robin,  in  which  Miss  Marv  Browne  was  the  third  con 
testant. 

On  the  closing  day  of  the  series,  Monday,  March  12,  McLoughlin  defeated 
Throckmorton,  0/4,6/4,4/6,6/3.  The  final  of  the  women's  tourney  brought  a 
defeat  for  Miss  Bjurstedt  at  the  hands  of  Miss  Browne,  former  holder  of  the 
national  title,  7/5.0/0.  In  another  exhibition  mixed  doubles  match.  Miss  Browne

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  31 

National   Preliminary   Doubles 

By  a.  II.  Lawson. 

The  most  representative  field  entered  in  anj'  doubles  event  in  this  country 
for  years  assembled  at  the  Onwentsia  Club,  Lake  Forest,  Tuesday,  August  15, 
191(5.  to  participate  in  the  National   Preliminary   Doubles. 

The  eight  dififerent  sections  of  the  country  were  represented  by  the  following 
teams  : 

Eastern — W.  E.  Davis,  San  Francisco,  and  G.  M.  Church,  Tenafly,  N.  J, 
Pavific  Coast — M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  Ward  Dawson,  Los  Angeles,  Cal. 
Southern — Nat  Emerson  and  Lou  Hardy,  Memphis,  Tenn. 
Xortli  western — Seiforde  Stellwagen  and  T.  N.  Jayne,  Minneapolis,  Minn. 
Southuestern — F.  II.  Wright  and  Bradley  Hogue,  Dallas,  Tex. 
Missouri  Vallen — .Tack  Cannon,  Kansas  City  and  A.  L.  Lindauer,  Chicago. 
Middle  Atlantic — C.  B.  Doyle  and  H.  C.  Breck,  Washington,  D.  C. 
Western — Walter  T.  Hayes  and  Ralph  Burdick,  Chicago. 

As  a  result  of  the  drawings  the  teams  were  paired  as  follows  :  South  vs.  North- 
west, Pacific  Coast  vs.  Missouri  Valley,  Eastern  vs.  Middle  Atlantic,  Southwest 
vs.  Western. 

At  the  last  moment,  however,  word  was  received  from  Washington  that,  owing 
to  business  reasons,  Doyle  and  Breck  would  be  unable  to  attend  and  their  entry 
was  withdrawn. 

In  the  first  round  great  interest  was  centered  in  the  Pacific  Coast  vs.  Missouri 
Valley  match.  While  it  was  conceded  that  Cannon  and  Lindauer  did  not  have 
a  chance  to  win,  this  would  be  the  first  match  in  which  the  public  would  see 
McLoughlin  and  his  new  partner,  Dawson,  in  action.  The  latter  had  very 
little  trouble  in  besting  Cannon  and  Lindauer,  their  play  being  too  fast  for  the 
Missouri  Valley  pair,  0/1,0/3.6/3.  Nat  Emerson  and  Lewis  Hardy,  representing 
the  South,  defeated  Stellwagen  and  Jayne  of  the  Northwestern  in  a  long  five-set 
match  after  dropping  the  first  two  sets.  Lobbing  was  the  favorite  tactic  re- 
sorted to  by  both  teams,  score  4/6,4/0,6/1,6/4.0/4.  The  Western  team,  Burdick 
and  Hayes,  proved  too  fast  for  the  Southwest,  Hogue  and  Wright,  winning  in 
straight  sets.  0/2,0/2,6/3. 

The  semi-finals  were  played  Wednesday,  August  10,  and  proved  a  surprise 
in  that  the  two  supposedly  weaker  teams  put  up  a  much  stronger  fight  than  was 
expected.  The  Western,  in  particular,  came  within  an  ace  of  putting  out  the 
East,  the  team  which  most  people  expected  would  win  the  right  to  play  the 
national  champions. 

The  Pacific  Coast  team  found  the  Southern  a  much  stronger  combination 
than  their  showing  of  the  previous  day  had  led  them  to  believe  they  were. 
While  both  the  Pacific  Coast  men  had  a  stronger  service  than  the  Southerners, 
the  latter  proved  good  getters  and  went  after  every  return,  no  matter  how 
apparently  hopeless  it  was.  They  forced  the  Coast  men  to  a  deuce  set  after 
the  score  was  4/1  against  them  in  the  first  set,  but  finally  lost,  8/6.  The  match 
was  full  of  amusing  situations  which  were  heartily  appreciated  by  the  gallery. 
Final  score.  8/0.0/1,6/4. 

In  the  match  between  the  West  and  East  for  three  sets  the  spectators  were 
treated  to  some  of  the  fastest  tennis  ever  seen  on  the  Onwentsia  courts.  Hayes  and 
Burdick  surprised  even  their  best  friends  with  the  brand  of  tennis  they  played. 
They  were  supposed  to  be  the  slower  team  of  the  two,  but  proved  as  speedy 
as  their  opponents,  and  showed  much  better  team  work.  After  winning  the  first 
two  sets,  6/3. S/6,  they  dropped  the  next  one,  6/4.  A  seven-minute  rest  had  a 
far  more  strengthening  effect  on  the  Eastern  team  than  on  the  Western.  Davis, 
whose  serve  had  not  been  working  wel',  seemed  to  have  overcome  this  defect 
and  served  numerous  aces,  while  Church  proved  Invincible  at  the  net.  The 
strain  of  the  first  three  sets  apparently  slowed  the  Westerners  up  and  Church 
and  Davis  took  the  next  two  sets,  6/3,6/2. 

Thursday.  August  17,  witnessed  the  finals  of  the  Preliminary  Doubles  for  the 
year  1016  when  the  Eastern  and  Pacific  Coast  teams  battled  for  supremacy. 
After  watching  the  two  teams  in  their  earlier  matches,  the  prevailing  opinion 
seemed  to  be  that  Church  nnd  Davis  would  carry  off  the  honors,  but,  as  fre- 
quently happens  in  all  branches  of  athletics,  the  team  that  was  picked  out  to 
win  went  down  to  defeat,  and  in  a  four-set  match  at  that.  The  match  by 
points  :

MISS   MOLLA   BJURSTEDT, 
National  Champion. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  35 

National  Women's  Championships 

By  Miss  Florence  Ballin. 

Rain,  a  steady  drizzHnsr  rain,  and  the  wonderful  playing  of  Miss  Molla  Bjur- 
stedt  in  tlie  chnllense  round,  were  the  outstanding  features  of  the  thirtieth 
women's  national  championships,  held  on  the  grass  courts  of  the  Philadelphia 
Cricket  Club  at  i<t.  Martins,  near  Philadelphia,  the  week  of  June  5.  There  was 
a  certain  lack  of  excitement  to  the  matches  of  the  tournament  proper,  due  to 
the  absence  of  a  number  of  the  leading  players.  None  of  the  Californians  came 
East,  and  neither  Mrs.  fJeorge  Wightman,  Mrs.  Marshall  McLean  nor  Miss  Marie 
Wagner  were  entered.  Mrs.  Edward  Raymond,  as  was  expected,  came  through 
the  winner  of  the  tournament,  but  although  she  had  played  Miss  Bjurstedt  a 
close  three-set  match  early  in  the  season,  in  the  challenge  round  in  this  instance 
she  found  her  opponent  at  her  very  best,  well-nigh  invincible,  and  went  down 
to  defeat  in  about  the  shortest  time  in  wtiich  a  match  has  ever  been  recorded — 
twenty-two  minutes. 

The  first  two  days  of  the  tournament  were  marked  by  fair  weather  and  every- 
thing went  smoothly,  with  no  notable  upsets.  Then  the  rain  started,  and  kept 
up  more  or  less  steadily  until  Saturday  afternoon.  Matches  were  played  in  a 
drizzling  rain,  on  slippery  courts  :  but  Mr.  Jennings,  by  good  management  and 
with  the  co-operation  of  the  players,  kept  up  fairly  well  with  his  schedule. 

The  fifth  round,  on  Friday,  saw  all  of  the  favorites  still  playing.  Miss 
Susanne  White  defeated  Mrs.  Hall  in  a  closely  contested  three-set  match  ;  but 
Mrs.  Barger-Wallach,  handicapped  by  the  heavy  courts,  was  unable  to  cope  with 
the  clever  placing  of  Mrs.  Raymond,  and  lost,  6/1,6/3.  Again,  In  the  semi- 
finals, Mrs.  Raymond  rose  superior  to  adverse  conditions  and,  playing  at  her 
best,  outgeneraled  Miss  Evelyn  Sears  to  the  score,  6/1,6/2.  Miss  Eleonora 
Sears  likewise  advanced  to  the  final  round  with  comparatively  little  trouble,  the 
wet  grass  onlv  serving  to  make  her  chops  more  deadly.  In  the  semi-final  round 
she  defeated  Miss  White.  6/2.6/3. 

Saturday  afternoon,  however,  found  the  ground  comparatively  dry  after  the 
morning's  wind,  and  although  Miss  Sears  put  all  she  had  on  the  ball,  she  was 
unable  to  upset  Mrs.  Raymond's  calm,  driving  game.  The  latter  played  a  heady 
game,  as  always,  coming  to  the  net  occasionally  for  points,  but  relying  in  the 
main  on  her  ability  to  coax  Miss  Sears  out  of  position  and  take  advantage  of 
the  resulting  openings. 

In  the  challenge  round,  however,  played  on  Monday  afternoon  under  a  sunny 
sky,  it  was  Miss  Bjurstedt  who  made  the  openings,  one  after  another,  and  sent 
her  ball  smashing  through.  So  swift  was  the  pace  she  set.  so  few  her  errors, 
that  the  match  was  over  before  Mrs.  Raymond  had  had  a  chance  to  show  the 
sterling  tennis  of  which  she  is  capable.  As  she  played  in  that  match.  Miss 
Bjurstedt  seemed  absolutely  unbeatable.  As  she  herself  said  afterwards,  "every- 
thing was  working,"  and  she  saw  to  it  that  it  worked  to  the  best  advantage. 
Her  service  was  well  placed  and  swifter  than  usual  :  her  backhand,  as  well  as 
her  forehand,  seemed  to  be  under  perfect  .control  and  her  court  covering  was, 
as  always,  remarkable.  It  seemed  impossible  to  force  her  out  of  position, 
although  this  was  partly  due  to  the  fact  that  she  kept  Mrs.  Raymond  almost 
entirely  on  the  defensive  by  the  speed  of  her  own  attack. 

As  in  the  singles,  the  doubles  did  not  bring  out  any  remarkable  playing  until 
the  final  match,  which  was  played  immediately  after  the  challenge  round  of  the 
singles.  In  the  third  round  Jliss  Disston  and  Miss  White  won  a  hard  fought 
match  from  Miss  Kissel  and  Mrs.  Wood,  but  found  themselves  unable  to  cope 
with  Miss  Bjurstedt  and  Miss  Eleonora  Sears  in  the  semi-flnals.  due  in  some 
small  part  to  their  lack  of  confidence.  In  the  final  match,  Mrs.  Raymond  came 
back  from  a  brief  rest  after  her  singles  match,  determined  to  make  a  good 
showing,  and  with  the  aid  of  Miss  Edna  Wildey.  nearly  succeeded  in  winning 
the  doubles  title.  A  better  women's  doubles  match  has  seldom  been  seen.  With 
the  exception  of  the  second  set,  when  Mrs.  Raymond  and  her  partner  slumped 
badly,  the  games  were  all  keenly  contested.  "  The  sounder  game  indeed  was 
played  by  the  eventual  losers,  who  many  times  in  the  third  set  had  victory 
almost  in  their  grasp,  only  to  lose  it  in  "the  end.  Their  headwork  was  excel- 
lent, their  use  of  both  drives  and  lobs  very  judicious.  However,  after  falling 
behind  In  the  third  set.  Miss  Biurstedt  and  Miss  Sears  settled  down  in  grim 
earnest  and.  directing  most  of  their  plays  at  Miss  Wildey.  whose  net  play  up 
to  this  point  had  been  excellent,  finally  forced  her  to  weaken  just  enough  to 
give  them  the  needed  points  for  victory.

The  mixed  doubles  was  also  won  by  Miss  Eleonora  Sears,  partnered  this  time 
with  Willis  Davis,  but  only  after  a  number  of  interesting  matches  had  been 
played.  Miss  Ballin  and  W.  T.  Tilden.  2nd,  after  a  close  battle  with  Mrs.  Wal- 
lach  and  Craij?  Biddle,  surprised  everyone  by  defeating  Miss  Bjurstedt  and 
Charles  M.  Bull  in  the  semi-final  round,  6/2,6/4.  Miss  Sheldon  and  Frank 
Hague  played  a  very  good  game  in  the  third  round,  defeating  Miss  Disston  and 
Thayer,  but  were  unfortunately  obliged  to  default  the  semi-final  round  on  Mon- 
day morning.  In  the  third  round,  too.  Miss  Sears  and  Davis  had  a  hard  struggle 
before  they  could  defeat  Miss  Kissel  and  Joe  Armstrong.  Davis,  who  had  been 
playing  erratically  the  first  set,  suddenly  came  into  his  own  in  the  middle  of 
the  second  set,  and  playing  all  over  the  court,  gave  a  very  good  exhibition  of 
tennis,  although  it  could  hardly  bo  called  "mixed  doubles."  This  set  he  won 
only  after  the  games  had  gone  to  deuce  several  times.  In  the  third,  Armstrong 
weakened  before  his  onslaught  and  lost  the  set,  6/3. 

In  the  final  round,  played  late  Monday  afternoon  after  the  women's  doubles, 
Davis  was  again  at  the  top  of  his  game.  But  he  had  acquired  wisdom  over 
Sunday  and  allowed  his  partner  to  handle  her  own  shots,  which  she  did  most 
capably,  a  method  which  worked  so  well  that  they  defeated  Miss  Ballin  and 
Tilden  In  an  interesting  exhibition  by  the  score  6/4,7/5. 

So  ended  the  thirtieth  women's  championship  meet,  which,  thanks  to  the 
capable  management  of  the  committee  headed  by  Mr.  Jennings,  and  despite  the 
very  unfavorable  weather  conditions,  was  a  most  enjoyable  tournament.  The

FINALISTS   IN   SINGLES   AT   SEVENTH   CLAY   COURT   CHAMPIONSHIPS, 

CLEVELAND.  OHIO. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  43 

Seventh  Clay  Court  Championships 

By  Observer. 

The  greatest  net  event  In  the  history  of  Cleveland  was  held  at  the  Lakewood 
Tennis  Club,  June  26  to  July  2,  and  Included,  according  to  George  M.  Church, 
"the  greatest  gathering  of  clay  court  stars  ever  assembled." 

It  could  well  he  called  a  "perfect  tourney,"  for  It  was  well  handled  both  by 
the  committee  in  charge  and  the  referee  ;  there  were  the  usual  upsets  in  dope  and 
all  sorts  of  thrilling  matches  for  the  spectators. 

Willis  E.  Davis  of  San  Francisco — California  and  Pennsylvania  State  Cham- 
pion—emerged from  the  finals  with  the  tourney  title,  having  won  in  straight 
sets  from  Conrad  B.  Doyle  of  Washington,  D.  C.  R.  Norris  Williams,  2nd, 
the  national  clay  court  tltleholder  in  men's  singles,  defaulting  in  the  challenge 
round  by  non-appearance,   the  coveted  national   honors  passed  to   Davis. 

Miss  Molla  Bjurstedt  of  Norway  outclassed  the  other  entries  In  the  women's 
singles,  winning  the  finals  from  Miss  Martha  Guthrie  of  Pittsburgh.  Miss 
Guthrie,  however,  put  up  a  determined,  splendid  battle  and  it  will  be  a  long 
time  before  a  tennis  gallery  will  see  a  better  set  in  women's  singles  than  the 
opening  frame  of  their  championship  match.  That  particular  set  was  brilliant 
and  went  to  deuce  twice  before  Miss  Bjurstedt  finally  won. 

In  the  men's  doubles  that  co-operating  firm  of  George  M.  Church  and  Dean 
Mathey  retained  their  national  title  by  defeating  Willis  E.  Davis  and  H.  Van 
Dyke  Johns  in  straight  sets.  The  Easterners  had  their  troubles  winning  the 
first  set,  due  to  the  wonderful  placement  shots  of  Davis,  but  got  their  bearings 
In  the  second  and  third  and,  while  pushed  rather  hard  now  and  then,  breezed 
through   to  victory   In   clever  style. 

Title  in  the  mixed  doubles  went  to  Miss  Bjurstedt  and  Church,  who  defeated 
Mrs.  Harry  Biekle,  champion  of  Canada,  and  C.  B.  Doyle.  The  affair  was 
somewhat  one-sided,  Doyle  having  been  tired  out  by  his  singles  match  with 
Davis,  which  had  been  contested  but  a  little  while  before. 

Rain,  lots  of  it,  put  a  damper  on  the  scheduled  opening  day  and  those 
festivities  had  to  be  held  over  from  Saturday,  June  24,  until  the  following  Mon- 
day. From  then  on  the  weather  was  all  that  could  be  asked  for;  the  condition 
of  the  courts  and  atmospheric  conditions  being  tiptop. 

On  his  way  to  victory  through  the  tournament  Davis  won  from  E.  G.  Guthery 
of  Cleveland  "in  the  first"  round  and  then  from  C.  R.  Apthorp  of  Cleveland.  John  C. 
Neely  of  Chicago.  W.  B.  Knox  of  Pittsburgh,  Charles  S.  Garland  of  Pittsburgh 
and,  finally,  Conrad  B.  Doyle  of  Washington. 

Doyle,  the  runner-up.  had  some  pretty  stiff  tussles  all  the  way  to  the,  finals, 
having  trouble  on  his  hands  when  he  disposed  of  Church  in  the  fifth  round, 
G/2.2/6.6/4,  and  asrain  in  the  semi-finals,  when  W.  S.  McEllroy  of  Pittsburgh 
played  him.  e/.*^, 6/3,7/5. 

Miss  Bjurstedt  made  herself  a  decided  favorite  by  her  clever  work  on  the 
courts.  On  her  initial  appearance  she  won  in  love  sets  from  Miss  Florence 
Rudolph  of  the  Lakewood  Club  and  next  defeated  Miss  Margaret  Taylor  of  New 
York,  6/1,6/0.  In  the  semi-final  round  Miss  Bjurstedt  met  and  defeated  Miss 
Florence  Ballin  of  New  York,  6/1, 6/M. 

The  combined  experience  of  Miss  Bjurstedt  and  Church,  coupled  with  the  fact 
that  both  were  at  tl\p  top  of  their  game,  made  the  mixed  doubles  a  rather  tame 
affair  for  them.  Some  of  the  other  matches  in  the  other  brackets,  however,  were 
closely  contested,  one  particularly  worthy  of  mention  being  between  Miss  Florence 
Ballin  of  New  York  and  Edwin  E.  McCormick  of  Los  Angeles  against  Miss  Buda 
Stephens  of  Toledo  and  H.  Van  Dyke  Johns  of  San  Francisco,  which  went  to  the 
former  pair,  6/4,6/3. 

Credit  for  the  successful  manner  in  which  the  tourney  was  conducted  belongs 
in  a  large  part  to  Referee  Harry  Seymour  of  Pittsburgh,  also  to  E.  G.  Guthery 
of  Cleveland,  chairman  of  the  tournament  committee,  and  R.  L.  Kroesen,  chair- 
man of  the  entertainment  committee. 

The  draw  showed  eighty  players  in  men's  singles,  sixteen  in  women's  singles, 
thirty-five  teams  in  men's  doubles  and  seven  teams  in  mixed  doubles. 

Prominent  among  the  out-of-town  contestants,  in  addition  to  the  ones  already 
mentioned,  were  R.  .\.  Holden.  Cincinnati;  W.  P.  B.  Knox.  Pittsburgh;  James

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  53 

National   Indoor   Championships,    1917 

S.  Howard  Voshell  of  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.,  won  the  singles  title  in  the  eighteenth 
national  indoor  championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Seventh  Regiment 
Tennis  Club,  at  the  armory  in  New  Yorlv,  beginning  February  10.  Voshell  by 
playing  perhaps  the  best  tennis  of  his  career  went  through  the  tournament  and 
met  Clifton  B.  Herd  in  the  tinal  round,  defeating  the  latter  in  straight  sets. 
He  handled  Herd's  whirlwind  service  with  comparative  ease,  outdrove  him  and 
held  his  own  in  volleying. 

In  the  doubles  Dr.  William  Rosenbaum  and  Fred  B.  Alexander  defeated  A.  H. 
Man,  Jr.,  and  C.  B.  Herd  in  the  final  round  after  a  five-set  match,  which  was 
streaky,  full  of  comedy  and  tragedy.  Alexander  was  the  point  winner,  Rosen- 
baum  being  unmercifully  hammered  from  start  to  finish  ;  and  it  was  in  the 
middle  of  the  fifth  set.  when  their  star  seemed  to  be  waning,  that  Rosenbaum 
improved  markedly  and  finished  with  a  burst  of  speed  that  carried  his  side  to 
victory.  Herd  was  fast  and  hit  hard,  but  he  was  as  wild  as  a  hawk  and  threw 
away  dozens  of  points.  Man  was  a  master  of  craft  as  usual,  and  with  a  little 
more  pace  might  have  turned  the  trick.     The  summaries :

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNDAL.  57 

Lon^wood  Singles  and  Eastern  Doubles 

William  M.  Joliiiston  is  now  Lonswood  cliampion,  and  George  M.  Churcli  and 
Willis  E.  Davis  Easti'rn  doul)le.s  cbainpions,  both  titles  being  won  in  the  tourna- 
ment held  on  the  courts  of  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club,  Boston,  Mass.,  beginning 
July  24.  Johnston  went  through  the  tournament  and  got  the  title  by  the  default 
of  Slaurice  E.  McLoughlin,  who  did   not  appear. 

The  competition  for  the  Longwood  singles  was  full  of  surprises.  The  greatest 
of  these  was  the  defeat  of  R.  N.  Williams,  2nd,  by  Clarence  J.  Griffin  on  the  first 
day  of  play  ;   it  w.is  in   straight  sets,  at  that. 

The  final  round  brought  Johnston  and  J.  J.  Armstrong  together.  The  former 
Bhowed  in  much  better  form  than  in  his  semi-final  match  with  Watson  M.  Wash- 
burn. He  knew  that  the  only  thing  to  do  was  to  take  the  net,  and  this  he  did 
consistently   and  despite  all   Armstrong's   efforts   to  stop  him. 

In  the  F2astern  doubles.  Church  and  Davis  were  favorites  for  the  title.  In  the 
final  round  against  Pell  and  Williams,  the  former  were  keen  to  win,  but  were  on 
the  very  verge  of  defeat.  It  was  their  anxiety  to  carry  off  the  laurels  that 
caused  them  to  play  poorly  many  times,  Davis  being  the  worst  offender.  But 
they  finally  pulled  the  match  out  of  the  hole  after  being- down  two  sets  to  one.

Western  Championships 

By  a.   II.    Lawson. 

The   twenty-ninth    Western    championship    tournament   was   held    at   the   On- 

entsia  Club,   Lake   Forest,  111.,  August  5-12,   191G.     Owing  to  the  fact  that  so 

any  of  the  crack  players  from  both  the  Pacific  and  Atlantic  Coasts  were  busily 

gai<»'d  in  defending  and  acquiring  championships  in  the  Eastern  tournaments, 

i   .e  Western  did  not  have  so  many  out  of  town  entries  as  usual,  with  the  result 

lat  the  interest  in  the  tournament  was  local  rather  than  national. 

The  authorities  who  had  the  tournament  in  charge  did  everything  that  could 

J  done  to  accommodate  the  out  of  town  players,  holding  the  tournament  back 

I    iree  days  to  insure  McLoughlin's  playing  in   the  singles,   but  were  doomed  to 

I    sappointmcut.     K.  Ilawkes,  the  youngster  of  whom  we  had  heard  great  reports, 

'  .'companied   McLoughlin  to   Chicago,   aud   decided   to   see  what   he  could  do  in 

,  ue  singles.      He  had   not,    however,   overcome   the   effects  of  his   long   trip,   nor 

lid  he   become  used  to  the  difference  between  grass  and  hard  courts,  with   the 

•esult  that  he  was  defeated  in  the  first  round  by  a  lad  of  his  own  age,  Futterer 

)f   the   University    of    Wisconsin.      Later   in    the   week,    however,   as   he   became 

ccustomed   to  the  change,   his   game  improved. 

In  the  preliminary  rounds  no  great  upsets  were  recorded,  though  Al  Green 
>t  the  Wanderers  caused  Ward  Dawson,  McLoughlin's  doubles  partner,  to  go 
three  fast  sets  in  the  third  round  in  order  to  defeat  him.  Green  played  an 
excellent  placement  game,  but  Dawson's  speed  finally  overcame  this  and  he 
von,  3/6,6/2,7/5.  In  the  fourth  round  things  began  to  happen.  Lockhorn  of 
Kansas  City  easily  defeated  James  Forstall,  founder  of  the  Chicago  Tennis 
Club,  Forstall  defaulting  in  the  second  set,  with  a  score  of  1/2  in  his  favor. 
Lockhorn  took  the  first  set,  6/2.  Jerry  Weber  was  forced  to  play  his  best  brand 
of  tennis  to  defeat  Carver,  the  Interscholastic  champion.  The  first  set  of  the 
match  went  to  9/7,  but  the  pace  proved  too  fast  for  Carver,  and  Jerry  took  the 
second  set,  0/3.  W.  M.  Blair,  the  Cornell  crack,  easily  defeated  Futterer, 
6/3.6/3.  Ralph  Burdick  caused  a  surprise  by  defeating  his  doubles  partner, 
Walter  Hayes.  6/4.6/4.  The  veteran  Waidner  came  back  with  a  vengeance, 
defeating  Al   Lindauer,   Conference  champion,   6/2,6/3. 

The  feature  match  in  this  round  was  between  Dawson  and  Byford.  Dawson 
being  a  Pacific  Coast  man  and  the  doubles  partner  of  McLoughlin,  the  gallery 
was  anxious  to  see  how  our  best  local  player's  game  would  compare  with  his. 
The  result  of  their  match  was  not  entirely  unexpected,  in  view  of  the  trouble 
Dawson  had  in  disposing  of  Al  Green  In  the  previous  round.  Byford  took  the 
first  set,  7/5,  but  it  was  hardly  expected  that  he  would  take  the  next,  6/0,  if 
Dawson  played  the  tennis  he  was  capable.  This  is  actually  what  happened, 
however,  as  Dawson  apparently  gave  up  trying  after  Byford  ran  up  a  good  lead 
on  h;m  in  the  second  set.  P.  Boyden,  one  of  the  younger  players  from  the 
Winnetka  Tennis  Club,  defeated  the  veteran  J.  C.  Neel'y  in  three  sets,  6/1,6/8,0/1. 
C.  J.  Lockliorn  of  Kansas  City  was  the  only  out-of-town  player  who  lasted 
until  the  semi-finals,  and  he  won  his  way  to  that  point  by  defeating  Jimmy 
Weber,  captain  of  the  Andover  team,  6/3,6/4.  Jerry  Weber  easily  disposed  of 
Blair,  6/2.0/2.  I'.urdick  proved  entirely  too  fast  for  Waidner  and  nipped  his 
hopes  of  reaching  the  finals  by  a  score  of  6/1.6/1. 

In  the  semi-finals  C.  J.  Lockhorn,  after  a  gruelling  four-set  match,  went  dov/n 
to  defeat  before  tli»»  more  aggressive  tactics  of  Jerry  Weber,  6/4.2/6,0/4,11/9,  and 
Burdick  demonstrated  that  as  a  singles  player  his  game  has  greatly  improved, 
though  he  was  defeated  in  four  sets  by  the  superior  play  of  Byford,  672,2/6,0/4, 
8/ti.  Byford  won  the  right  to  challenge  Church,  holder  of  the  Western  champion- 
ship, by  defeating  Jerry  Weber  in  four  sets.  At  no  time  was  he  in  much  danger 
of  losing  the  match,  though  he  did  not  show  the  same  accuracy  in  the  placement 
of  his  shots  as  had  characterized  his  play  in  previous  rounds. 

The  challenge  round,  to  which  all  looked  forward  with  interest,  proved  rather 
disappointing,  especially  to  local  fans,  for  Byford  was  unable  to  take  a  set. 
Church  proved  so  fast  that  Byford  did  not  have  a  chance  to  get  started.  When 
Church  took  the  net  it  seemed  impossilile  to  pass  him,  and  placements  which 
would  ordinarily  be  impossible  to  get.  Church  returned.  He  took  the  match  and 
retained  the  chamiiionship  by  a  score  of  0/4.6/0.0/1. 

In  the  upper  half  of  the  men's  doubles  Jerry  and  Jimmy  Weber  had  a  strenu- 
ous time  reaching  the  semi-finals.  Their  first  match  was  with  Paul  Gardner  and 
W.  McCormiok  Blair,  which  they  won,  0/2,0/8,0/1.7/9,6/0.  They  ran  into  some 
more  competition  in  the  third  round  when  thev  met  W.  M.  Blair  and  A.  H. 
McCormick,  who  forced  them  to  go  five  more  fast  sets,  8/10,4/6,6/4,6/4,6/2,     In 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  63 

the  fourth  round  they  had  a  comparatively  easy  time  of  it,  defeating  W.  A. 
Tutterer  and  W.  Naef,  0/3,(5/2. (i/2.  and  they  struggled  through  to  the  final  by 
defeating  M  Green  and  M.  G.  Ketchum.  3/0,0/3.5/7.0/4,0/3. 

Hayes  and  Burdick  in  the  lower  frame  waded  through  their  adversaries  in 
three-set  matches,  losing  not  more  than  three  games  in  any  one  set,  and  by 
the  time  they  reached  the  final  round  were  playing  excellent  tennis.  So  good 
Indeed  were  they  that  the  Weber  boys  found  it  impossible  to  take  more  than 
three  games   from   them   in   the  entire  three   sets. 

If  there  was  a  dearth  of  out-of-town  men  in  the  men's  matches,  the  out-of- 
town  women  responded  nobly  to  the  call.  Miss  Evelyn  Seavy  of  Kansas  City, 
Miss  Marguerite  Davis  and  Miss  Alice  Drake  of  St.  Paul,  Miss  Alice  Miller  of 
Milwaukee  and  Miss  Lesley  LeBeaume  of  St.  Louis  were  a  few  of  the  fair  sex  from 
distant  cities  who  sought  to  carry  off  the  women's  Western  championship. 

In  the  upper  half  of  the  singles.  Miss  Katherine  Voorhees  of  Evanstofl 
reached  the  semi-final  by  defeating  Miss  Alice  Drake  of  St.  Paul,  and  Miss 
Marguerite  Davis  reached  the  same  position  in  the  lower  half  by  disposing  of 
Miss  Marion  Steever  of  Ili'ghland  Park.  Miss  Davis  won  the  riglit  to  challenge 
Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely,  champion  of  1915,  by  defeating  Miss  Voorhees  in  a  hard 
tlirec-sct  match,  5/7,7/5,0/2.  Miss  Davis'  hard  driving  shots  and  placement 
also  proved  too  much  for  Miss  Neely,  and  she  went  down  to  defeat  in  a  two-set 
match,  0/3,6/3. 

The  women's  doubles  matches,  as  the  men's,  developed  into  contests  between 
local  talent.  The  Misses  Steever  and  Voorhees  proved  by  far  the  stronger  team 
of  the  entries,  easily  defeating  Miss  Neely  and  Miss  Higbie  in  the  final  round, 
6/2,6/1.      The    summaries :

pated in  the  eleventh  annual  Central  Iowa  championship  tournament,  held  on  the  courts 
of  the  Grinnell  Country  Club,  July  17  to  21,  having  been  permanently  transferred  from 
Toledo,  Iowa.  There  were  forty-seven  entries  in  singles  and  twenty  teams  In  the 
doubles.  Fred  W.  Bradley  of  Des  Moines,  former  State  champion,  won  the  singles,  and 
with  Edward  Pottle  of  Grinnell,  the  doubles.  Bradley  lost  only  one.  set  during  the  tourna- 
ment. In  the  final  round  of  the  singles  Bradley  was  opposed  by  George  A.  Baker,  who 
after  winning  the  first  set  was  compelled  to  retire  from  the  court  owing  to  illness.  The 
match,  therefore,  went  to  Bradley,  3/6,7/5.6/3,  default.  The  doubles  brought  out  spirited 
competition,  all  matches  in  the  semi-final  and  final  rounds  going  five  sets.  The  final  round 
between  Bradley  and  Pottle  and  B.  O.  M.  Bonebrake  and  Clin  J.  Sweet  was  very  close, 
the  final  set  being  decided  by  a  burst  of  speed  on  the  part  of  the  winners,  Bradley  and 
Pottle,  who  literally  smashed  their  way  through  to  victory  in  the  last  two  games.  The 
score  was  1/6.6/3.6/4,3/6.7/5.  Olin  J.  Sweet  defeated  Benjamin  Ellsworth  in  the  con-

Illinois-Missouri-Iowa  Tournament. — The  sixth  annual  Illinois-Missouri-Iowa  tournament, 
held  on  the  courts  of  the  Burlington  Golf  Club  during  the  week  of  August  7,  was  consid- 
ered by  many  to  have  been  the  most  successful  that  the  Three  States  Association  ever 
enjoyed.  From  start  to  finish  the  play  was  fast  and  spirited,  and  although  in  most  cases 
the  favorite  who  it  was  predicted  would  win  was  victorious,  in  some  instances  the  dope 
was  upset.  Hard  matches  were  the  rule  in  the  doubles,  except  in  the  final,  and  this  also 
proved  true  in  the  mixed  doubles.  In  the  singles  T.  E.  Musselman  of  Quincy,  111.,  defeated 
H.  L.  Beyer  of  Grinnell,  It)wa,  In  straight  sets,  6/1.6/4,6/2.  This  pair  carried  off  the

final  round.  In  the  mixed  doubles,  Mrs.  Perkins  and  I.  E.  Mounet  of  Norman,  Okla., 
won  from  Julianne  Doane  of  Burlington,   Iowa,  and  R.  A.  Rath  of  Waterloo,  Iowa.

Pacific  Coast  Championships 

Bz  Cabl  U.   Gaboneb. 

"Billy"  Johnston,  National  champion  at  the  time,  regained  his  title  ot  Pacific 
Coast  champion  on  the  Hotel  Del  Monte  courts  in  most  Impressive  style,  wheu  he 
swept  through  the  field  with  the  loss  of  only  two  sets.  He  defeated  Carl  B. 
Gardner  in  the  semi-final  round,  6/3.6/3,4/6,6/4,  and  Clarence  Griffin  in  the  final 
at  9/7,7/5.6/8,8/6.  The  latter  match  was  an  especially  brilliant  one  and  kept 
the  gallery  in  a  highly  nervous  state  of  excitement  throughout.  Griffin  never 
played  better  and  time  and  again  he  had  his  doubles  partner  In  tight  places,  only 
to  see  him  whirl  out  through  terrific  driving  attacks.  Johnston  seemed  able  to 
do  anything  with  the  ball  when  it  came  to  the  pinches,  and  his  display  of 
racket  work  was  the  most  scintillating  seen  in  this  tournament  for  many  a 
year.     This  victory  gave  Johnston  his  third  win  of  California's  premier  event 

Miss  Helen  Baker  of  San  Francisco  captured  the  women's  title,  defeating  Miss 
Marjorie  Thorn  in  the  final  round  at  8/6.6/4.  Her  hardest  match  was  with 
Mrs.  Cushing  in  the  second  round,  which  she  won  at  6/3.4/6,6/2,  Mrs.  Cush- 
Ing's  rock-like  steadiness  was  quite  an  obstacle  to  Miss  Baker,  but  severe  driving 
pulled  her  through.  One  of  the  surprises  was  Miss  Claire  Cassel's  defeat  in  the 
first  round  by  Miss  Thorn,  5/7,6/3.6/3. 

Miss  Baker  and  Miss  Anita  Myers  won  the  doubles  title  by  defeating  Miss 
Cassel  and  Mrs.  Cushing  in  the  final  round  at  6/4,6/3,  The  mixed  doubles  went

Pacific  Coast  Doubles 

Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  and  Ward  Dawson  carried  oCf  the  honors  In  the 
twenty-ninth  annual  Pacific  Coast  sectional  doubles  championship,  held  on  the 
courts  at  Long  Beach,  Cal.,  beginning  July  1.  Twenty-eight  teams  from  all  parts 
of  the  State  entered,  and  the  tournament  was  the  most  successful  in  the  history 
of  the  competition.  Among  the  prominent  players  missing  were  William  M. 
Johnston,  C.  J.  Griffin,  C.  R.  Gardner  and  M.  H.  Long.  The  tournament  was 
free  from  upsets,  and  all  the  favorites  won  as  the  "dope"  dictated. 

The  draw  separated  the  best  four  teams,  bringing  them  together  only  In  the 
semi-finals,  where  McLoughlin  and  Dawson  defeated  Nat  Browne  and  Claude 
Wayne  in  the  upper  half,  with  Bundy  and  Herd  winning  from  Roberts  and 
Detrick  in  the  lower  half. 

When  the  opposing  teams  faced  each  other  in  the  finals  a  strong  wind  wag 
blowing,  but  the  lobbing  was  excellent.  McLoughlin  was  steady  and  good  all 
around.  Herd  played  the  most  spectacular  tennis  of  the  four.  Bundy  was  right 
on  the  job.  steadying  his  partner.  Naturally,  Dawson  had  a  big  share  of  work 
to  do  in  standing  up  under  the  attack  of  Bundy  and  Herd,  but  he  was  at  his 
best.  The  match  went  five  sets,  McLoughlin  and  Dawson  winning.  The

Bay  Counties  Championships 


The  annual  championship  of  the  Bay  Counties  was  played  on  November  19 
and  the  following  Sundays.  The  tournament  was  held  at  the  Golden  Gate  Park 
courts  in  San  Francisco.  Some  high-class  tennis  resulted,  as  Carlton  R.  Gardner, 
Roland  Roberts,  Byron  Batkin,  Clyde  Curley  and  William  Marcus  were  among 
the  sixty-four  entries. 

The  singles  event  was  won  by  Roberts,  who  defeated  Cl.vde  Curley  in  the 
final  round.  The  doubles  were  won  by  John  R.  Strachan  and  William  A.  Marcus, 
the  California  and  Washington  State  title  holders.  They  defeated  Gardner  and 
Roberts  in  the  final   round,  6/2,3/6,6/3,6/4. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  69 

The  upset  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  Carl  Gardner  at  the  hands  of 
Dr.  S.  Weiss  in  the  third  round.  Gardner  was  out  of  form  and  could  not  cope 
with   the  steady  chopping  of  Weiss. 

Curley  had  a  narrow  escape  in  the  semi-final  round,  winning  from  Batkin  only 
after  five  very  hard  sets,  two  of  which  went  to  deuce.  The  score  was  5/7,8/6, 
6/3,3/6,6/4. 

Roberts  had  an  easy  time  in  his  semi-final  match.  He  played  Levy,  a  promis- 
ing junior  of  Oakland,  and  defeated  him,  6/4.6/3,6/1. 

The  best  tennis  of  the  singles  event  was  played  in  the  final  match  between 
Roberts  and  Curley,  Both  players  have  fast  high-bounding  serves  which  they 
use  to  good  advantage  by  rushing  the  net.  Curley  won  the  first  set,  6/3,  and 
Roberts  the  next,  at  the  same  score.  These  two  sets  were  more  in  the  form  of 
practice  than  anything  else,  as  neither  man  had  played  for  several  weeks,  owing 
to  the  bad  weather.  After  the  first  two  sets,  good  tennis  was  played  through- 
out the  remainder  of  the  match  and  Roberts  won  because  he  was  a  trifle  steadier. 
The  entire  score  was  3/6,6/3.3/6,6/3,6/4. 

The  doubles  tournament  produced  better  tennis  than  the  singles,  as  there 
were  several  teams  that  were  evenly  matched.  Gardner  and  Roberts  played  the 
Kinsey  brothers,  Raymond  and  Howard.  The  score  of  this  match  was  6/2,6/2, 
1/6,8/6.  Strachan  and  Marcus  lost  the  first  set  to  Batkin  and  Curley,  3/6, 
and  then  won  the  next  three,  7/5,6/4.6/2. 

The  final  match  in  doubles  was  played  on  December  10.  The  light  on  the 
north  side  of  the  court  is  very  poor  at  this  time  of  the  year,  so  it  was  a  decided 
advantage  to  the  players  on  the  south  side.  Strachan  and  Marcus  won  the 
first  set,  6/2,  and  Gardner  and  Roberts  the  next,  3/6.  It  was  very  good  tennis 
all  through  the  match,  the  four  players  keeping  the  ball  low  and  rushing  the 
net  at  every  opportunity.  Strachan  and  Marcus  were  steadier  than  their  oppo- 
nents and  they  won  the  third  and  fourth  sets  at  6/3,6/4. 

There  were  sixty-four  entries  in  the  singles  and  twenty-five  teams  in  the 
doubles.  This  large  entry  list  in  singles  broke  all  records  for  the  thirteen  years 
of  the  championship.     The  summaries :

Ojai  Valley  Tournament 

By  William  Thacher,  President  Ojai  Vallet  Tennis  Club. 

The  twenty-first  annual  Ojai  Valley  open  tournament,  held  on  the  courts  at 
Nordhoff,  Southern  California,  was  an  unqualified  success,  due  in  a  great  meas- 
ure to  almost  perfect  weather  conditions.  There  were  fourteen  events  with  an 
entry  list  of  two  hundred  and  sixty-nine,  being  one  of  the  largest  in  the  history 
of  the  tournament.  So  well  was  the  competition  managed  that  it  was  concluded 
within   the   time   selected — April   13.    14   and   15. 

The  most  exciting  match  of  the  tournament  was  the  final  round  of  the  men's 
singles  between  E.  II.  Rogers  and  H.  L.  Ilahn.  Much  to  the  surprise  of  a 
large  gallery,  Hahn  had  defeated  GriflTin  for  the  Pacific  Coast  championship  and 
also  won  the  intercollegiate  singles  at  the  Ojai  tournament,  but  in  spite  of  these 
victories  Rogers  took  two  sets  out  of  three.  The  doubles  went  to  E.  Warren 
and  E.  R.  McCormick.  Mrs.  F.ruce  and  McCormick  won  the  mixed  doubles,  after 
losing  the  first  set  to  Mrs.   Williams  and  Tluirston. 

Exhibition  matches  between  players  of  national  and  international  renown 
were  a  feature  of  the  tournament.  On  the  final  day  Miss  Mary  Browne  and 
Maurice  E.  Mcl.oughlin  defeated  Mrs.  Williams  and  Thomas  C.  Bundy,  7/.5,6/3, 
and  later  Barber  and  Lipman  were  defeated  by  McLoughlin  and  Bundy,  6/4,6/1, 
In  the  presence  of  a  big  gallerv. 

In  the  women's  singles.  Miss  Florence  Sutton,  for  three  consecutive  years 
winner  of  the  Ojai  tournament,  was  defeated  by  Miss  Mary  Browne,  and  in  the 
final  Miss  Browne  won  from  Mrs.  Bruce.  In  the  doubles.  Miss  Browne  and  Mrs. 
Williams  easily  defeated  Mrs,  Bruce  and  Miss  Florence  Sutton.    The  summaries :

days  of  play  in  September  at  the  Berkeley  Tennis  Club,  Berkeley,  Cal.  A  new

en's singleg  like  water  through  a  sieve.

a  set  and  there  won  from  Robert  Ijpman  in  a  four-set  match,  6/4,6/2,0/6,6/3.

By  John  R.  Stuachan. 

The  1916  championship  of  San  Francisco  was  won  by  Roland  Roberts  of  the

74  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

28  to  June  4,  on  the  asphalt  courts  of  the  California  Lawn  Tennis  Club.  There 
were  forty-three  entries,  and  Roberts  came  through  the  final  round  with  the 
loss  of  only  one  set.  In  the  semi-finals  he  had  no  trouble  in  defeating  William 
Marcus,  6/1,6/4,6/0,  while  in  the  other  half  it  took  Clyde  J.  Curley  five  sets 
to  eliminate  C.  B.  Detrick,  6/3,0/6,4/6,6/2,6/4. '  This  match  was  by  far  the 
best  of  the  tournament,  both  men  playing  five  sets  of  first-class  tennis.  Roberts 
won  the  final  match  from  Curley  in  three  straight  sets,  but  they  were  all  very 
cloBe,    7/5,11/9,6/3. 


Northern  California  Interclub  League 

The  formation  of  the  Northern  California  Interclub  League,  with  the  eight 
leading  tennis  clubs  and  the  Universities  of  California  and  Stanford  as  mem- 
bers, marked  a  big  step  forward  in  the  game  for  the  year  of  1916.  There  were 
ten  competing  teams,  consisting  of  between  ten  and  sixteen  men  each.  The 
tournament  was  run  in  two  divisions  with  five  teams  in  each,  and  after  round 
robin  play  in  each  half  the  two  teams  with  the  highest  percentage  played  off  for 
the   championship. 

Sacramento,  Stockton,  University  of  California,  Oakland  and  the  Golden  Gate 
Park  Tennis  Club  of  San  Francisco  composed  one  half,  while  the  other  was  made 
up  of  Berkeley,  San  Jose,  Stanford  University.  Alameda,  and  the  California  Lawn 
Tennis  Club  of  San  Francisco. 

As  was  expected,  the  California  Club  won  rather  easily,  going  through  its  half 
with  little  opposition  and  defeating  the  winner  of  the  other,  the  Golden  Gate 
Tennis  Club,  in  the  play-ofiC,  by  ten  matches  to  two.  There  were  eight  singles  and 
four  doubles  matches  to  each  meet,  the  various  meets  being  held  on  Sundays 
at  different  places,  starting  in  March  and  ending  the  last  Sunday  in  May. 

As  the  California  Club  had  not  only  the  national  singles  and  doubles  cham- 
pions, Johnston  and  Grifiin,  on  its  team,  but  also  Strachan,  Melville  Long,  Gard- 
ner and  others  of  scarcely  less  note,  it  could  hardly  have  lost. 

Seattle  (Wash.)  City  Championships. — W.  A.  McBiirney  in  men's  singles,  L.  Brown  and

ners  in  the  tournament  for  the  Seattle  City  championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  !

boy,  was  the  winner,  coming  through  five  rounds  with  the  loss  of  only  one  set. 

Western  Federation  of  Tennis  Clubs,  Los  Angeles,  Calif. — Owing  to  the  enthusiasm 
of  the  game  of  tennis  among  tlie  colored  people  of  Southern  California  and  the  growth 
and  progress  so  phenomenal,  it  became  necessary  to  effect  an  organization  to  encourage 
the  scientific  playing  of  tennis  and  sanction  the  holding  of  tournaments  in  the  West.  The 
clubs  represented  in  this  association  are:  Alpha,  Three  Boys,  West  Side  and  Young  Women's 
Athletic  League  of  Los  Angeles,  and  the  Pasadena,  Glendale  and  Santa  Monica  tennis 
clubs.  The  present  officers  of  the  Federation  are:  Dr.  A.  C.  Garrott,  president;  E.  J. 
Peters,  vice-president;  Paul  R.  Williams,  secretary;  Mrs.  Katherine  Murdock,  treasurer. 
The  first  tournament  was  held  in  Glendale,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Glendale  Club  at 
which  time  Howard  Drew,  the  phenomenal  colored  athlete,  won  the  men's  singles.  Other 
tournaments  have  been  held  by  the  Alpha,  Santa  Monica,  Pasadena  and  West  Side  clubs. 
Miss  Fern  Caldwell  of  Los  Angeles  is  the  present  holder  of  the  ladies'  singles.  Ballinger 
Kemp  of  the  Alpha  club  is  the  holder  of  the  men's  singles  championship.  The  outlook 
for  this  organization  is  exceedingly  bright  and  its  players  can  be  counted  upon  to  make 
excellent  records  for  themselves  in  any  part  of  the  country. 

Woodland  Park  Tournament,  Seattle,  Wash. — The  fourth  annual  Woodland  Park  tennis 
tournament  came  to  a  close  on  Labor  Day,  September  4.  This  tournament  was  established 
three  years  ago  to  encourage  the  younger  players  "on  the  public  courts  of  Seattle"  In 
tournament  play.  The  entry  list  increased  from  32  in  1913  to  186  in  1916,  with  many  of 
Ihe  best  players  in  the  State  competing.  This  brought  out  some  very  high  class  tennis 
nil  through  the  1916  meet,  and  especially  in  the  finals  of  the  men's  doubles,  where  the 
veterans,  Mansel-Smith  and  Anderson,  were  defeated  by  Van  Kuran  and  Langdon,  in  a 
hard  fought  match  that  went  the  full  five  sets,  and  lasted  four  hours.  The  score  was 
4/6,8/6,9/7,3/6,6/3.  Mansel-Smith  won  the  singles,  by  defeating  his  doubles  partner, 
Crawford  Anderson,  6/4,0/6,10/8,6/3.  Miss  Myra  Lambuth  won  the  women's  singles, 
defeating  Miss  Armis  Greene,  6/4.6/3,  and  paired  with  Miss  Louise  Yandell,  won  the 
ivomen's  doubles.     Miss  Yandell  and  Van  Kuran  won  the  mixed  doubles.

versity tennis  team,  won  the  New  England  championship  in  the  tournament  held

the  champion  of  1915,  played  through  the  tournament,  but  was  eliminated  in 
the  fourth  round  by  Stoddart.  The  latter's  opponent  in  the  final  round  was 
Jerry  Weber,  and  after  an  interesting  five-set  match  Stoddart  won. 

In  the  doubles,  W.  L.  Ferris  of  New  Haven  and  F.  H.  Harris  played  well 
together,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they  had  never  paired  before.  They 
met  Amos  Wilder  and  Peter  Ball  in  the  final  round  and  their  accuracy  was  too 
much  for  the  hard-hitting  Yale  men.     The  summaries :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  79 

Tri-State  Tournament 

By  Joseph  H.  O'Connell. 

The  eighteenth  annual  Trl-State  tournament  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
Cincinnati  Tennis  Club,  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  September  9  to  16,  1916.  Never 
in  the  history  of  the  Tri-State  tournament  have  such  stars  been  brought  into 
competition.  William  M.  Johnston,  national  champion  in  1915  and  runner-up 
In  1916,  played  through  and  won  the  Tri-State  championship  in  singles.  He 
paired  with  C.  J.  Griffin,  his  national  championship  doubles  partner,  and  they 
"Won  the  doubles  championship.  The  ladies'  singles  championship  was  won  by 
Miss  Martha  Guthrie  of  Pittsburgh.  Although  all  of  the  matches  were  close 
and  well  contested,  the  feature  matches  were  those  between  Dean  Mathey  and 
Wm.  Johnston  in  the  semi-finals  singles,  which  the  latter  won,  6/2,3/6,6/3,6/4  ; 
also  the  finals  doubles  match  between  Johnston  and  Griffin  and  Mathey  and 
Davis.  The  overhead  smashing  of  Mathey  time  after  time  evened  the  score 
find  the  nnmbers  of  rallies  kept  the  crowd  on  their  feet  most  of  the  time.  John- 
ston was  In  splendid  form,  his  forehand  worked  with  great  precision  and  he 
continually  made  aces  In  the  corners.  This  match  lasted  until  dark,  with  the 
ficore  6/2,3/6,6/4,5/7.1/3,  on  the  deciding  set,  when  the  contestants  were  forced 
to  etop.  The  following  morning  Johnston  and  Griffin  easily  won  five  games  and 
the  championship. 

There  were  no  upsets  for  the  ont-of-town  stars  In  the  first  three  rounds, 
although  W.  H.  Hopple,  Cincinnati,  gave  Ella  Fottrell  a  scare  in  the  second 
round  when  he  forced  the  score  to  10-all  in  the  deciding  game.  Fottrell,  how- 
ever, by  clever  placing  and  smashing  finally  won,  12/10.  The  fourth  round 
found  all  of  the  local  players  eliminated  except  Harold  LeBlond,  who  succumbed 
to  Elia  Fottrell  after  a  well-played  match.  One  of  the  most  creditable  matches 
was  that  of  T.  Mclv.  Cummins  of  Wheeling.  W.  Va.,  and  W.  M,  Johnston,  the 
latter  winning,  6/4,4/6,6/1,6/3.  Fritz  Bastian  of  Indianapolis  also  played  a 
Strong  game,   losing  to  Willis  Davis  in  the  fourth  round. 

In  the  men's  doubles.  Davis  and  Mathey  and  Johnston  and  Griffin  advanced 
to  the  finals.  The  national  champions  had  to  extend  themselves  to  the  limit 
to  beat  their  fellow  Californians,  Roberts  and  Fottrell  making  a  well-balanced 
end  strong  pair. 

ITie  women's  singles  brought  out  a  splendid  list  of  entries,  by  far  the  best 
that  the  Trl-State  has  had,  the  play  being  marked  by  a  series  of  good  matches 
beginning  with  the  first  day  and  keeping  up  all  week.  Among  the  entries  were 
Miss  Hires  of  Kansas  City,  Mrs.  Ellis  of  Chicago,  Mrs.  Adams  of  Indianapolis, 
Miss  Brown  of  Indianapolis,  and  Miss  Davis  of  Milwaukee.     Last  year's  cham- 

Elon,  Miss  Ruth  Saunders,  played  a  remarkably  strong  game  against  Miss  Davis, 
ut  was  defeated.  Miss  Jfartha  Guthrie  won  the  championship  by  defeating 
Miss  Davis,  6/4,6/1.  The  champion.  Miss  Guthrie,  was  at  no  time  in  danger 
and   played  in  true  championship  form.     The  summaries :

JOSEPH  J.  ARMSTRONG, 
Philadelphia. 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  86 

Newport  Invitation  Tournament 

Although  only  held  for  the  second  time  last  year,  this  event  has  become  already 
as  much  of  a  tixture  in  tennis  as  similar  contests  of  much  longer  duration  in 
the  annual  schedule.  Designed  to  fill  the  void  occasioned  by  the  transfer  of  the 
national  championships,  which  had  been  held  for  so  many  years  on  the  Casino 
courts,  and  held  only  a  short  time  previous  to  that  event,  the  Newport  invita- 
tion serves  to  bring  together  the  leading  players  of  the  country,  with  the  result 
that  the  spectators  are  treated  to  exhibitions  of  skill  that  would  be  hard  to 
surpass. 

The  sensation  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  William  M.  Johnston  at  the 
hands  of  Ichiya  Kumagae,  the  Japanese  player  who  visited  the  United  States 
last  summer  and  whose  skill  will  be  long  remembered  in  American  tennis  annals. 
As  the  summary  shows,  the  entry  list  embraced  a  large  proportion  of  the 
topnotchers.

83  SPALDIHG'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Seabri^ht  Invitation   Tournament 

After  fourteen  years  in  competition  the  Achelis  Cup,  a  handsome  trophy 
donated  by  the  Seabright  Lawn  Tenuis  and  Cricket  Club,  has  passed  into  the 
permanent  possession  of  Richard  Nonis  Williams,  2nd,  by  virtue  of  his  third 
victory,  in  the  tournament  held  on  the  grass  courts  of  the  club  at  Seabright, 
N.  J.,  during  the  week  of  August  7.  Williams  met  George  M.  Church,  the  tourna- 
ment winner,  in  the  challenge  round  and  after  a  rather  sensational  dye-set  match 
Williams  won,  5/7,6/3,6/3,4/6,6/2. 

The  doubles  brought  together  the  East  vs.  West  opponents,  Karl  H.  Behr 
and  Fred  B.  Alexander  opposing  William  M,  Johnston  and  C.  J.  Griifin.  It  was 
a  desperately  fought  contest,  Johnston  and  Griffin,  just  managing  to  win,  8/10, 
6/3,11/0,6/4. 

Church  was  the  favorite  over  R.  Lindley  Murray  in  the  final  of  the  singles, 
and  he  won.  Rain  fell  during  the  greater  part  of  the  match,  but  the  gallery 
remained  to  the  finish.  Church  was  not  headed  at  any  time.  In  each  set  he 
ran  to  a  quick  lead  and  in  the  first  two  kept  it  throughout.  In  the  third  he 
got  to  4/0  only  to  be  evened  by  a  fine  rally  of  Murray's,  but  tight  work  at 
the  flnisli   saved  the  set   from   going   to   deuce. 

In  the  challenge  round  many  were  of  the  opinion  that  Church  would  win,  but 
a  majority  of  the  spectators  clung  to  the  belief  in  Williams'  superiority. 
Although  defeated.  Church  played  at  the  very  top  of  his  form.  He  failed  to  win 
because  Williams  was  greatly  superior  in  the  back  court,  yet  could  come  in  and 
volley  when  he  wanted  to  or  had  to.  The  latter  was  confident  throughout  the 
match  and  never  seemed  to  have   any  doubt  of  the  result. 

Although  Behr  and  Alexander  put  up  a  better  fight  against  the  national 
champions  than  in  the  East  vs.  West  series,  they  failed  to  reverse  the  decision 
in  that  match.  Only  the  second  set  w^ent  by  any  mai-gin  to  either  team.  The 
element  of  youth  had  much  to  do  with  the  champions'  final  victory.  The 
veterans  started  out  strong  and  finished  strong  enough,  but  lagged  at  various 
points  on  the  road,  while  the  wiry  Johnston  and  his  astonishingly  agile  partner 
didn't  let  up  a  moment.     The  summaries  :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  89 

Sleepy  Hollow  Invitation  Tournament 

Br  Walter  B.  Mahony, 

vs  in  1914,  whoa  the  Sleepy  Hollow  invitation  tournament  was  inaugurated, 

,  California    "dark    horse"    went   through    the   best   of    the   Metropolitan    cracks 

J  earned  the  right  to  have  his  name  inscribed  upon  the  Governors  Challenge 

,wl,   which    has   now    become  one   of   the   most  coveted    trophies   in    the   game. 

e  striking  victories  of  K.  Lindley  Murray  over  Fred  Alexander,  Karl  Behr  and 

.Trill  Hall  in  the  final  day's  play  of  the   first  Sleepy   Hollow  tournament  are 

11  talked  about  and  now  Murray   has   a  worthy  successor   in  his  fellow   Cali- 

rnian,   Willis   Uavis,  who  defeated  G.   Carlton   Shafer,   C.   M.    Bull,   Jr.,   Cedric 

ajor,  Harold  Throckmorton  and  George  Church  on  his  way  to  the  final  victory. 

,ie  field  comprised  all  of  the  leaders  in  the  section  about  New  York,  with  the 

ception   of   Pell,    Bcekman   and    Dabney,   all   of   whom   were   entered    but   were 

reed  to  default  in  the  first  round.     Karl  Behr,  W.  M.  Washburn  and  Merrill 

<all  participated  only  in  the  doubles. 

The  finals  of  the  singles  were  played  before  a  large  gallery  on  the  morning 
:  Memorial  Day.  Tlie  Pacific  Coast  player  was  forced  to  the  full  five  sets  by 
hurch.  Davis  played  with  aggressiveness  and  brilliancy  and  carried  his  oppo- 
ent  off  his  feet  in  the  first  two  sets,  but  when  Church  adopted  a  different 
tyle  of  meeting  the  attack  by  lobbing  instead  of  matching  speed  with  speed, 
e  was  enabled  to  even  the  score  at  two  .sets-all.  In  taking  the  third  and 
jurth  sets  Church  played  himself  out  and  his  weakened  condition  was  respon- 
ible  for  his  failure  to  take  more  than  two  games  in  the  final  set  which  deter- 
ained    the    winner   of   the    tournament. 

In  the  doubles,  Throckmorton  and  Davis  came  through  to  the  finals  after 
lefeating  Ward  and  .Johnston,  Bull  and  Thurber,  and  Behr  and  Washburn.  la 
he  latter  match  Davis  was  credited  in  one  game  with  four  service  aces  against 
wo  members  of  the  "upper  ten."  This  is  an  indication  of  the  strength  of  the 
,"alifornian's  service  throughout. 

The  meeting  was  in  every  way  successful  and  was  completed  upon  schedule, 
)eing  saved  the  misfortunes  of  weather,  which  interfered  in  prior  years.  F.  B. 
Vlexander,  E.  C.  Conlin,  W.  D.  Cunningham  and  Allan  White,  the  club  pro- 
V.'^sional,  assisted  in  running  off  the  play,  which  was  directed  by  Walter  B.

SPAIJ)ING'3   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  93 

Lawn  Tennis  in  the  Metropolitan  District 


Metropolitan  Championships 


George  M.  Church  and  Dean  Mathey  were  the  title  winners  in  the  tournament 
for  the  Metropolitan  championship,  held  on  the  fine  dirt  courts  of  the  Bronxvllle 
Athletic  Association,  Bronxvllle,  N.  Y.  Church  went  through  the  field  of  sin- 
?les,  defeating  Mathey  in  the  final  round,  6/3,6/4,9/7.  Church  and  Mathey 
defeated  H.  H.  Hackett  and  W.  M.  Hall,  the  1915  winners,  in  the  doubles,  6/1, 
6/3.  The  tournament,  which  began  June  10,  was  greatly  hampered  by  rain,  and 
the  doubles  final  was  not  played  until  June  18,  and  the  singles  final  July  8. 

Watson  M.  W»shbum,  the  1915  winner,  survived  until  his  match  with  George 
M.  Church  in  the  semi-final  round.  As  Church  performs  just  as  well  on  dirt 
courts  as  on  grass  courts,  while  Washburn  is  not  at  his  best  on  dirt  courts,  the 
letter's  defeat  was  not  at  all  surprising,  although  he  did  win  the  second  set. 

In  the  final  round  Mathey  continued  the  splendid  work  which  had  compassed 
the  downfall  of  Alexander,  Inman  and  Throckmorton,  but  to  no  avail.  Church 
was  headed  only   once  and  demonstrated  his  mastery   conclusively. 

As  Church  and  Mathey  were  so  much  the  pick  of  the  singles  players,  it  was 
not  surprising  that  they  won  the  doubles  together.  Nobody  could  stop  them,  and 
they  did  not  lose  a  set.  Harold  H.  Hackett  and  W.  Merrill  Hall  were  the  next 
strongest  team  and  their  work  was  smooth,  even  in  the  final,  but  not  good 
enough  to  hold  the  Princetonians.  The  latter  went  at  a  dashing  pace,  killed 
everything,  despite  the  dampness  of  the  courts,  which  bothered  all  four  men 
about  equally,  and  held  the  net  stubbornly.    The  summaries :

Metropolitan  women's  championships,  held  on  the  dirt  courts  of  the  West  bide

appeared  In  the  competition,  and  although  winds,  gales,  ram  and  soft  courts 
prevailed,  the  playing  was  not  held  up  very  long,  nor  was  the  ardor  of  the 
contestants  dampened.      Mlsa  Bjurstedt's  victory  was  not  easily  accomplished.

the  tournament  for  the  Sullivan  County  (N.  Y.)  championship,  held  on  the 
courts  of  the  Merriewold  Tennis  Club,  beginning  August  7.  Ho  went  through

Halsey  Wood  of  the  New  York  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  who  has  two  legs  on  the 
challenge  cup.  The  round  was  practically  decided  in  the  first  set,  which  Swayne 
won,  9/7.     After  that  he  had  but  little  opposition. 

Wood  and  R.  B.  R'ockwood  were  too  much  for  C.  Smith  and  A.  Shriver  in  the 
final  round  of  the  doubles,  the  match  being  decided  in  straight  sets.  The  sum-

^  California  State  Championships 

^  By  Carl  R.   Gardner. 

John  R.  Strachan,  famous  rival  of  William  Johnston  in  California,  is  again 
the  California  State  champion,  having  regained  the  title  he  defaulted  a  year 
ago  to  Willis  Davis,  by  a  sweeping  victory  on  the  Claremont  Country  Club  courts 
In  Oakland,  over  the  largest  field  of  players  ever  entered  in  this  event.  He 
dropped  only  one  set  in  the  tournament  and  was  never  in  the  least  danger. 

In  the  final  round  Strachan  met  Carl  R.  Gardner,  who  had  come  through 
his  half  with  the  loss  of  but  one  set,  and  that  to  Mel  Rosenberg,  and  won  from 
him  at  3/0,6/1,(5/2.6/2.  Gardner  set  a  very  fast  pace  at  the  start,  but  it  was 
of  short  duration  and  thereafter  he  found  Strachan's  defense  utterly  Impregnable. 
The  champion  covered  his  court  like  a  blanket,  seldom  going  to  the  net,  but  hardly 
ever  missing  a  ground  stroke. 

Strachan  disposed  of  William  Eklund  of  Honolulu,  who  has  been  the  cham- 
pion of  the  Hawaiian  Islands  for  the  past  three  years,  in  the  semi-final  round 
at  6/1,6/3,8/6. 

Strachan  and  William  Marcus  won  the  doubles  championship,  defeating  Dr. 
Samuel  Ilardv  and  Gardner  in  the  final  round  in  one  of  the  hardest  matches  ever 
fought  in  the  State.  The  scores  were  2/6.6/1,5/7,12/10.6/4,  and  the  match  lasted 
over  three  hours. 

Miss  .'Vnita  Myers  took  the  women's  title  by  winning  from  Mrs.  J.  C.  Cushing 
In  the  final  round,  2/6,6/3.6/4.  Mrs.  Cushiiig  was  at  all  times  dangerous,  but 
the  champion'.s  cleverly  placed  chops  proved  more  than  she  could  handle. 

John  C.  Rohlfs  won  the  veterans'  title,  for  men  over  thirty-five  years  of  age, 
-causing  considerable  comment  by  the  way  in  which  he  disposed  of  such  men  as 
Stanley  Smith   and  Charles   Stickney.     The   summaries :

Georgia  State  Championships 


The  Georgia  State  championship  tournament  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
West  End  Tennis  Club  of  .\tlanta,  beginning  .August  14.  This  tournament  had 
more  entrants  than  anj'  other  competition  of  the  kind  ever  held  in  the  South. 
There  were  more  than  ninety  players  competing  in  the  singles  and  more  than 
thirty   teams   in    the  doubles. 

One  of  the  best  matches  was  in  the  third  round  between  C.  Y.  Smith,  winner 
of  the  tournament,  and  E.  V.  Carter.  Smith  won.  6/3,6/3.  The  semi-finals 
between  Jeff  Hunt  and  B.  R.  Rhett,  in  the  upper  bracket,  and  C.  Y.  Smith  and 
E.  S.  Mansfield,  in  the  lower  bracket,  were  both  good  matches  and  hard  fought. 
The  final  between  Smith  and  Hunt  went  to  Smith  in  straight  sets.  The  secret 
of  his  success  was  the  change  of  pace  which  he  used  to  great  advantage. 

The  doubles  between  Smith  and  E.  S.  Mansfield  and  E.  V.  Carter  and  J.  K. 
Orr  were  won  by  the  former  pair  after  a  close  four-set  match. 

The  women's  singles  was  won  by  Mrs.  John  Milam,  who  defeated  Mrs.  J.  K. 
McCord  in  straight  sets.  The  feature  of  this  match  was  the  net  playing  of  Mrs. 
Milam,  she  making  most  of  the  points  by  fast  volleying. 

The  consolation  of  men's  singles  was  won  by  Harry  Hallman,  who  defeated 
T.  L.  Jennings,  Sr.,  in  easy  fashion,  6/1,6/1,6/1.  The  consolation  doubles  be- 
tween Frank  Owens  and  W.  C.  Warren  and  Harry  Hallman  and  Harry  Ashe 
were  won  by  Owens  and  Warren  after  a  long  four-set  match,  6/4,10/12,6/4,6/4.

Indiana  State  Championships 


Reuben  A.  Holden.  Jr..  of  Cincinnati,  former  Yale  captain  and  Intercollegiate 
ch'Tiipion.  by  winning  the  Indiana  championship  for  the  third  time  thus  ob- 
tained permanent  possession  of  the  Mayer  trophy,  which  has  been  in  competi- 
tion for  a  number  of  years.  The  meeting  was  held,  as  usual,  on  the  courts 
of  the  Indianapolis  Tennis  Association,  during  the  week  of  August  7.  Holden 
beat  Cedric  Major  of  New  York  in  the  final  round  in  straight  sets  and  he  had 
previously  defeated  Charles  S.  Garland,  last  year's  winner,  in  five  sets. 

The  entry  list  showed  that,  besides  all  the  Indianapolis  players — Charles  P. 
Trask,  Fritz  Bastian.  (iage  Iloag,  Jack  McKay,  Cullen  Thomas,  and  .Tohn  Hen- 
nessey— a  host  of  men  with  reputations  were  in  Indianapolis  to  carry  the  State 
title  "away  to  other  regions.  From  Pittsburgh  came  seven  of  that  city's  best, 
headed  by  "Chuck"  and  Chisholm  Garlr.ud.  There  were  Walter  Knox  and 
J.  (i.  Castle  among  the  Smoky  City  men.  Cincinnati  sent  Holden  and  Daniel 
Kiefer  :   New  York   contributed  Cedric  Major. 

The  final  in  the  singles  between  Holden  and  Major  was  a  great  exhibition  of 
tennis.  The  crowd  thought  that  Holden  would  be  somewhat  tired  out  by  his 
play  the  day  before  with  Garland,  but,  if  anything,  he  had  more  accuracy  on 
the  last  day  than  on  any  other  during  the  match.  Holden  took  three  straight 
sets,  l)/3,6/4.fi/2,  and  by  so  doing  won  the  Mayer  silver  bowl  permanently. 

The  doubles  began  on  Wednesday  and  on  that  day  the  best  match  of  the 
event  came  off.  Major  and  T.  Hendricks,  an  Indianapolis  player,  opposed  Holden 
of  CinciDDati  teaming  with   Wilson  of  Pittsburgh.     Holden  and   Wilson  finally

won,  just  as  darkness  began  to  set  in.  The  scores,  3/6,7/5,9/7,  show  what  a 
contest  it  was,  and  the  losers  were  congratulated  just  as  much  as  the  winners. 
Holden  and  Wilson  played  through  to  the  finals,  only  being  beaten  by  Knox 
and  Castle  of  Pittsburgh,  6/3,6/3. 

In  the  women's  singles,  Mrs.  C.  Willis  Adams,  formerly  of  Chicago  but  now 
of  Indianapolis,  won  the  trophy  only  after  overcoming  serious  opposition  from 
Miss  Lyons  and  Mrs.  Long  of  Louisville  and  Miss  Katherine  Brown,  the  previous 
champion,  and  Mrs.  Pugh,  one-time  State  champion.

New  York  State  Championships 

The  annual  New  York  State  championships  were  held  under  ideal  playing 
conditions  on  the  dirt  courts  of  the  Yahnundasis  Golf  Club,  Utica,  N.  Y..  begin- 
ning July  10,  The  singles  were  won  by  Ichiya  Kumagae,  the  distinguished 
Japanese  player,  who  defeated  Clarence  J.  Griffin  in  the  final  round.  6/2.6/1.8/6. 
The  latter  was  more  successful  in  the  doubles  for,  paired  with  Roland  Roberts, 
he  won  without  much  trouble  from  the  191. "5  titleholders,  W.  S.  McEllroy  and 
C.  S.  Garland,   in  the  final   round,  6/4,6/1,6/4. 

In  the  final  round  of  the  singles,  Kuraagae's  drive  prevailed  against  Griffin 
•when  he  stayed  back,  and  when  he  came  in  Kumagae  passed  him.  There  was 
no  doubt  in  the  minds  of  those  present  that  while  Griflin  pla.ved  below  his 
real   form  Kumagae  was  his  master  on  this  occasion. 

Griflin  and  Roberts  were  never  in  danger  in  the  final  round  of  doubles.  They 
played  their  best  game  of  the  tournament.  Roberts  was  steadier  than  at  any 
previous  time,  and  he  had  plenty  of  speed.  Griffin  seemed  to  be  relieved  to  be 
at  the  double  game  after  his  disastrous  experience  in  singles — Kumagae  having 
just  defeated  him — and  he  was  snappy  and  confident.     The  summaries  :

Rhode  Island  State  Championships 

Douglas  S.  Watters  of  New  Orleans  won  the  singles  championship  and  Wai- 
ters and  Harold  A.  Mackinney  took  the  doubles  honors  in  the  tournament  for 
the  championship  of  Rhode  Island,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Agawam  Hunt  Club, 
Providence.  R.  I.,  beginning  August  7.  Watters  met  Russell  N.  Dana,  the  1915 
champion,  in  the  final  round  of  singles  and  in  a  closely  contested  five-set  match 
Watters  won.  The  doubles  contest  was  exceedingly  interesting  on  account  of 
its  closeness  and  the  fact  that  the  ultimate  result  was  always  in  the  balance 
until  the  last  game  was  played.  After  a  long  four-set  match  in  the  final  round, 
Watters  and  Mackinney  were  declared  the  winners  over  Josiah  Wheelwright 
and   H.  B.   Bretz  of  Boston.     The  summaries :

Wisconsin  State  Championships 

By  C.  R.  Rounds. 

The  outstanding  feature  of  the  twenty-ninth  annual  Wisconsin  State  tennis 
tournament,  held  on  the  historic  Town  Club  site  at  Milwaukee,  August  19-31, 
1916,  was  the  marked  improvement  shown  by  the  Milwaukee  players,  which 
found  its  climax  in  the  brilliant  five-set  finals  match  between  Alfred  Weller, 
the  nineteen-year-old  Milwaukee  boy,  and  Heath  Byford  of  Chicago,  the  veteran 
finally  winning  by  the  score  7/9,3/6,6/0.6/0,7/5.  Weller  played  a  heady  game  and 
made  Byford  work  for  every  point  and  yet  he  did  not  work  himself  out  by 
taking  the  aggressive.  How  near  he  came  to  succeeding  in  winning  is  attested 
by  the  remarkable  fact  that  with  the  score  5/4  on  his  service  he  was  no  less 
than  four  times  within  one  point  of  the  advantage  game  and  match.  Byford  thus 
comes  into  permanent  possession  of  the  challenge  trophy,  which  also  bears  the 
names   of  J.   I.   B.   Larned,    W.  T.    Hayes,   Alexander   Squair  and   Crozier. 

After  but  a  short  interval  Alfred  Weller  with  his  partner.  Glen  Maxon.  Jr.,  went 
out  and  defeated  Byford  and  Green  in  the  finals  of  the  doubles,  6/4,1/6,5/7,6/3, 
8/6.  The  younger  men  directed  their  play  at  Green  almost  wholly,  and  though 
he  rallied  after  the  first  set  and  stood  the  fire  for  two  sharp  battles,  the  strain 
finally  told  on  him  and  he  with  his  partner  had  to  accept  defeat  in  the  fifth 
set  after  the  sharpest  kind  of  a  struggle. 

In  the  finals  of  the  men's  consolation  singles  John  Wahl  of  Milwaukee  de- 
feated Joe  Pollard  of  Chicago.  6/2,6/1,6/2.  Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely  of  Chicago 
defeated  Miss  Voorhees  in  the  finals  of  the  women's  singles,  11/9,6/0,  thus  gain- 
ing permanent  possession  of  the  challenge  cup.  Miss  Neely  and  Miss  Voorhees 
won  the  women's  doubles  championship  from  Mrs.  Miller  and  Mrs.  Ellis,  8/6,6/2. 
Mrs.  Wells  of  Milwaukee  defeated  Mrs.  Hatton  in  the  women's  consolation 
singles,  6/1,6/1.  In  the  mixed  doubles  Miss  Voorhees  and  Glen  Maxoa  defeated 
Miss  Seavey  and  Heath  Byford,  6/4,6/2.     Summaries :

Florida  State  Championships,  1917 

By  Sol  Metzgbr. 

Whilp  there  was  no  challenge  round  this  year  in  the  eighth  annual  tourna- 
ment for  the  championship  of  Florida,  the  interest  in  the  game  lessened  but 
Ittle  in  consequence  of  the  announcement  that  all  winners  of  previous  touma- 
nents  must  play  through.  Last  year  the  old  Royal  Poinciana  challenge  bowl 
)eciuno  the  permanent  property  of  George  M.  Church,  who  won  the  trophy  by 
three  consecutive  victories. 

There  was  little  doubt  as  to  who  would  win  the  title  this  year  and  gain  a 
leg  on  the  new  challenge  bowl.  Craig  Biddlo  of  Philadelphia,  playing  far  better 
tennis  than  at  any  previous  season,  was  looked  upon  as  the  victor,  and  he 
made  good    in   every   way. 

In  the  final  Biddle  met  A.  S.  Dahney,  who  had  won  a  rather  spectacular 
semi-final  match  from  G.  C.  Shafer.  In  only  the  first  set  of  the  finals  was  the 
lontest  close,  Biddle  winning  as  he  liked. 

The  doubles  went  to  Inman  and  Biddle,  who  defeated  E.  F.  Torrey  and  John 
S.  Phipps  in  the  final.  The  surprise  in  the  doubles  and  in  the  whole  touma- 
men  ,  for  that  matter,  was  the  defeat  of  G.  C.  Shafer  and  G.  S.  Bryan  in  the 
semi-finals  by  Torrey  and  Phipps.     Bryan  and  Shafer  were  looked  upon  as  easy

winners  and  they  took  the  first  set  6/1,  as  was  expected.  But  careless  play  and 
a  very  bad  day  on  the  part  of  Bryan  eventually  cost  the  match,  though  the 
losers  were  within  a  point  of  the  set  victory  at  eight  different  times.  The

Northwestern  Championships 

By  Charles  Jounson. 

Heath  Byford  of  Chicago  did  not  run  up  against  any  stiff  opposition  In  the 
Northwestern  championship  to\irnament,  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  Mlnne- 
tonka  Yacht  Club  at  Deephaven.  The  Chicagoan  easily  won  the  singles  honors, 
and  because  George  Church,  winner  in  1915.  failed  to  defend  his  title  in  the 
challenge   round,    Byford    carried   off   the    championship.      He   made   quick    work

of  every  one  of  his  matches.  He  went  Into  the  final  round  against  Seiforde 
Stellwapen  of  Minneapolis  and  it  took  him  only  three  sets  to  capture  the  title. 

John  W.  Adams,  Jr.,  of  Minneapolis,  who  was  conceded  the  best  chance  against 
Byford,  cut  his  foot  while  in  bathing  during  the  progress  of  the  tournament  and, 
because  of  this  accident,  he  went  down  to  defeat  at  the  hands  of  Stellwagen, 
his  most  bitter  rival,   in  the  semi-final  round. 

Trafford  Jayne  and  Seiforde  Stellwagen  carried  off  the  doubles  championship 
In  a  hot  five-set  match  with  Ward  Burton  and  John  W.  Adams,  Jr.,  2/6  6/1  0/6

John  Strachan  and  other  San  Francisco  players  won  all  the  events  except 
one,  women's  doubles,  in  the  twonty-sisth  annual  tournament  for  the  cham- 
pionship of,  the  Pacific  Northwest,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Tacoma  Lawn 
Tennis  Club,  Tacoma,  Wash.  The  tournament  was  successful  from  every  stand- 
point, the  entry  list  being  large,  the  average  of  play  high,  the  weather  fine,  and 
the  courts   in   excellent  condition. 

Strachan  earned  his  victory  by  sheer  good  playing.  Clyde  Curley,  his  opponent 
in  the  final  round,  also  played  an  excellent  game,  but  was  no  match  for 
Strachan.  In  the  doubles  Strachan  paired  with  William  Marcus,  by  consistent 
team  play  and  brilliant  net  work  annexed  the  doubles.  Miss  Anita  Myers 
defeated  Miss  Sara  Livingstone  in  the  final  round  of  the  women's  singles.  The 
women's  doubles  went  to  Mrs.  Bragdon  and  Miss  Livingstone,  and  the  mixed 
doubles  were  captured  by  Miss  Helen  Baker  and  Clyde  Curley.     The  summaries  :

SPAXDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  137 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Pennsylvania 

Western  Pennsylvania  Championships 

Bi'    IIauuy    Skyjioik,    Pittsbtrgh. 

Willis  Davis  and  Van  Dyke  Jolins  of  Sau  Francisco  took  about  all  the  men's 
titles  for  the  championship  of  Western  I'ennsylvania,  on  the  Pittsburgh  Ath- 
letic Association  courts.  The  women's  singles  went  to  Miss  Martha  Guthrie, 
and  the  mixed  doubles  to  Miss  Guthrie  and  S.  Garrison,  Jr. 

Davis  had  little  difficulty  with  his  side  of  the  bracket  and  was  not  pressed 
until  he  met  Johns,  who  got  one  set  and  ran  another  into  deuce.  Johns  had  a 
hard  match  wirth  Walter  Knox,  a  local  boy,  member  of  the  1916  Princeton 
team,  and  McEllroy  also  gave  him  a  run  for  the  last  set,  but  Johns  pulled 
together  when   the  score   had  gone  to  deuce  and   won   out. 

In  the  challenge  match  P.  D.  Siverd  came  out  of  retirement  and  tried  to  stop 
the  tall  Californian,  without  success,  the  scores,  0/1,6/2,6/3,  gi>»ing  a  fair  idea 
of  the  match. 

Miss  Martha  Guthrie  was  picked  to  win  the  singles  and  lived  up  to  her 
reputation,  the  only  interest  remaiuing  being  who  would  be  the  runner-up.  A 
dark  horse.  Miss  Mabel  Miller  of  Blairsville,  defeated  most  of  the  local  girls. 
Miss  .Vnna  C.  Turner  going  down  in  the  semi-final  round.  Miss  Miller  played 
in  the  1915  clay  court  championship  here  and  later  won  the  Northwestern 
I'ennsylvania  championship  at  New   Castle. 

Miss  Guthrie  and  S.  Garrison  had  a  hard  match  in  the  final  against  Mrs.  F.  C. 
Irish  and  King  Scott,  and  rain  delayed  the  match  so  that  it  was  not  finished  until 
about  eight  p.m. 

The  entry  in  singles  was  three  times  the  usual  size  of  the  Western  Pennsyl- 
vania tournament,  which  heretofore  had  been  played  at  the  Pittsburgh  Golf  Club. 
It  was  started  back  in  1889,  when.  Marshall  Christy  took  the  first  title.  In  last 
year's  event  Miss  Sara  Christy,  his  daughter,  was  one  of  the  contestants  in 
women's   singles. 

Doubles  tournaments  for  the  same  title  have  been  played  heretofore  at  the 
Altoona  Cricket  Club.  Last  year,  by  arrangement,  the  entire  schedule  was 
transferred  to  the  Pittsburgh  Athletic  Association,  the  Altoona  club  taking  title 
of    Central    Pennsylvania    championships    instead. 

Davis  and  Johns'  path  to  the  doubles  events  was  not  as  easy  as  that  in 
singles.  I*.  D.  Siverd  and  T.  C.  Ward,  Pittsburgh's  crack  doubles  pair,  gave 
them  a  hard  run  in  their  half  of  the  bracket,  the  knowing  ones  feeling  that 
had  Siverd  played  up  to  standard  the  match  would  have  been  won  by  the  Pitts- 
burgh pair.  McEllroy  and  Garland,  the  New  York  State  title  holders,  also  gave 
tliem  a  run,  but  were  not  strong  enough  to  get  the  victory.  The  matches  were 
played   by  agreement,  two  out  of  three  sets. 

Morning  play  was  unnecessary,  excepting  in  a  few  of  the  women's  events, 
and  the  long  days  helping  materially  to  schedule  play  late  in  the  day  so  that 
business   men   could    take   part  in   the   play   without  interruption. 

F.  A.  Galer  of  Jeannette,  sixty  years  young,  celebrated  b.y  winning  his  first 
match.  Other  out-of-town  players  who  got  into  the  matches  were  T.  V.  A. 
Malloy  of  New  Castle.  F.  B.  Ransom  and  George  Ransom  of  Beaver  Falls,  and 
Gerald  S.  Wise  of  Butler. 

C.  S.  Garland  made  the  semi-final  against  Davis,  defeating  on  the  way  W.  J. 
Askin.  R.  G.  Gunn,  Herbert  Patterson,  W.  M.  Murdoch  and  Paul  Maher.  all 
veterans  of  local  tournaments,  some  of  them  twice  his  size  and  weight. 

McEllroy  put  out  Ransom.  Wright,  Wylie  and  Hodil  in  straight  sets,  but  was 
tinable  to  get  Johns  down,  the  Californian  having  one  of  his  best  days.  J.  G. 
Castle,  the  Stanton  Heights  hope,  was  obliged  to  default  after  winning  one 
match,  business  out  of  the  city  taking  him  away. 

The  tournament  was  interesting  largely  because  of  the  wealth  of  new  mate- 
rial in  young  players  from  Carnegie  Tech  and  Pittsburgh,  who  showed  by  their 
improvement  that  they  will  be  heard  from  in  this  year's  events.

Northeastern  Pennsylvania  Championships 

Northeastern  Pennsylvania  championships  in  men's  singles,  men's  doubles, 
women's  singles  and  women's  doubles  were  held  on  the  five  clay  courts  of  the 
Country  Club  of  Scranton,  Pa.,  September  13  to  16,  inclusive.  The  final  match 
in  men's  singles  was  one  of  the  best  ever  played  on  the  local  courts.  Voshell  won 
the  first  two  sets  quite  easily,  but  then  Whitney  braced  and  played  almost 
unbeatable  tennis  and  won  the  third  and  fourth  sets.  The  final  was  a  long 
deuce  set,  in  which  Whitney  was  within  one  point  of  the  match,  only  to  be 
overtaken  by  Voshell  and  finally  defeated  in  one  of  the  closest  of  matches.  The 
men's  doubles  went  to  Voshell  and  Baggs,  who  won  easily  from  Shafer  and 
Ostendorf  in   three    straight    sots. 

The  women's  singles  brought  together  Miss  Helen  Gilleaudeau  and  Misg 
Marie  Wagner,  The  first  set  went  to  Miss  Gilleaudeau  rather  easily,  and  the 
Becond  to  Miss  Wagner  even  more  easily,  but  the  last  set  found  both  of  the 
players  at  their  best,  and  although  Miss  Wagner  was  once  within  a  point  of  the 
set  and  match,  still  Miss  Gilleaudeau  was  entirely  too  active  and  steady  and 
won  out  at  8/6.  The  women's  doubles  were  won  by  a  local  team  composed  of 
Mrs.  Belin   and  Miss  Storrs. 

The  winning  of  the  singles  gives  S,  H,  Voshell  his  second  leg  on  the  beautiful 
challenge  cup,  which  has  also  been  won  by  Leonard  Beekman  and  Louis  Graves, 
and   by  G.   C.    Shafer  twice.     The   summaries ;

President  Philadelphia  and  District  Lawn  Tennis  Association. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  ]51 

The  tournament,  which  began  June  20,  was  held  on  the  turf  courts  of  the  Ger- 
nantown  Cricket  Club  and.  although  the  absence  of  several  famous  players  was 
1  disappointment,  it  was  fully  as  successful  as  its  predecessors. 

From  the  beginning  it  ajipeared  to  be  the  general  opinion  that  Roland  Evans, 
fr.,  and  C.  S.  Rogers  would  be  the  only  serious  rivals  to  contest  the  title  with 
Pearson.  In  the  third  round,  however,  Evans,  contrary  to  expectation,  was  put 
,iut  by  Rogers,  leaving  the  latter  as  opponent  of  Pearson  in  the  final  round. 
This  match  resulted  in  the  success  of  Pearson,  after  having  lost  the  second  set. 

The  doubles  were  won  by  a  new  combination,  R.  Evans,  Jr.,  and  R.  Harte, 
ivho  defeated,  on  their  way  to  the  finals,  Pearson  and  Wister,  in  sequence  sets. 
The  draw  brought  all  the  good  pairs  in  one  half.  J.  R.  Rowland  and  E.  M. 
Edwards  were  runners-up  and,  although  outclassed,  forced  Evans  and  Harte  to 
work  every  minute  of  the  time  to  defeat  them.     The  summaries  :

Chicago  Associated  Tennis  Clubs 

By  R.  G.  Crandall. 

The  Chicago  Associated  Tennis  Clubs  is  an  outgrowth  of  the  efforts  of  several 
f  the  tennis  clubs  in  Chicago  to  arrange  interclub  matches.  Such  matches  were 
eld  from  time  to  time  as  the  different  clubs  were  brought  together  by  their 
Qutual  desire  for  club  contests,  and  their  value  being  recognized  as  a  stimulant 
o  better  play  and  tennis  enthusiasm,  steps  were  taken  in  the  summer  of  1914 
o  place  such   contests  upon  a  systematic  and   permanent  basis. 

The  first  year  of  the  association's  existence  proved  that  it  met  a  need  which 
lad  long  been  felt  in  Chicago.  In  a  small  way  it  had  organized  tennis  sentiment 
,nd  had  aroused  an  interest  which  was  evidenced  by  a  banquet  at  the  close  of 
he  season.  Progress  has  been  so  rapid  that  during  the  season  of  1916  eighteen 
lubs.  representing  a  membership  of  eighteen  hundred  players,  took  part  in  its 
.ctlvities. 

Last  summer  the  usual  interclub  contests  were  held,  a  total  of  seventy-three 
uch  matches  being  played,  and  the  clubs  were  arranged  for  this  purpose  in 
wo  divisions,  the  winners  of  which  played  for  the  championship  of  the  associa- 
lon.     Near  the  end  of  the  season  singles  and  doubles  tournaments  were  held. 

In  the  fall  of  191fi  permission  was  obtained  from  the  municipal  authorities 
o  use  the  new  Municipal  Pier  for  the  playing  of  tennis  during  the  winter 
nonths.  The  association  at  once  proceeded  to  install  the  necessary  equipment 
'or  this  purpose,  and  the  public  interest  became  so  great  that  twenty  courts 
vere  provided  to  meet  the  demand  of  those  who  wished  to  play.  A  number  of 
(pen  tournaments  were  held,  in  all  of  which  there  were  large  entry  lists,  and 
lundreds  of  tennis  enthusiasts  were  given  the  opportunity  of  continuing  this 
'orm  of  recreation  throughout  the  winter.  The  association  thus  provided  the 
irst  opportunity  that  had  existed  in  Chicago  for  the  playing  of  indoor  tennis 
ind  carried  on  the  largest  undertaking  of  its  kind  that  had  yet  been  attempted 
n  this  country.

West  Suburban  Tennis  Association 

By  R.  W.  Merrill. 

A  new  tennis  association  in  the  suburbs  west  of  Chicago,  along  the  line 
of  the  Burlington  Railroad,  was  organized  in  1916  when  representatives  from 
the  tennis  clubs  of  Hinsdale,  Riverside,  La  Grange,  Western  Springs  and  Berwyn 
decided  to  hold  an  annual  tournament  under  the  supervision  of  the  association, 
with  the  above  clubs  as  contestants.  The  1916  tournament,  which  was  held 
on  the  courts  of  the  Hinsdale  Tennis  Club,  was  entered  by  over  50  players  from 
the  various  clubs  and  developed  some  remarkably  fast  play  in  both  singles  and 
doubles.  The  final  round  in  singles  bafween  Hinckley  of  Hinsdale  and  Nielsen 
of  Berwyn  resulted  in  a  victory  for  Nielsen,  who  is  a  member  of  the  University 
of  Wisconsin  tennis  team.  The  final  round  in  doubles  was  won  by  Hamill  and 
Hinckley  of  Hinsdale  from  Gross  and  Evans  of  Riverside.  Unusual  interest  is 
being  displayed  by  players  in  the  Chicago  suburbs,  and  the  annual  tournament 
of  the  West  Suburban  Tennis  Association  is  bound  to  be  one  of  the  biggest 
factors  in  Chicago  tennis  circles. 


Electric  Lighted  Outdoor  Doubles  Tournament 

The  Chicago  Tennis  Club  has  the  distinction  of  holding  the  first  night  tennis 
tournament  ever  held  in  the  West,  if  not  in  the  history  of  the  game. 

The  club  had  one  of  its  cement  courts  illuminated  with  six  Mazda  flood  lights 
with  500  watts,  each  strung  on  each  side  of  the  court,  and  the  light  was  so 
diffused  that  no  shadows  resulted.  The  players  who  participated  say  that 
they  were  capable  of  playing  as  fast  a  game  under  this  style  of  artificial  light 
as  by  the  light  of  Old   Sol. 

The  tournament  opened  September  25  and  continued  for  two  weeks,  no 
matches  being  played  on  Saturday  or  Sunday  nights.  Hayes  and  Burdick, 
Western  champions,  won  by  defeating  Miller  and  Wylie  in  the  final  round,  3/6, 
6/3,6/0,6/2.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  165 

Chicago  Beach  Invitation  Tournament 

The  annual  invitation  tournament,  licld  on  the  clay  courts  of  the  Chicago 
Beach  Hotel  from  July  1  to  July  7,  furnished  the  tennis  fans  of  Chicago  with 
exhibitions  of  excellent  tennis.  Several  upsets  were  sprung  on  the  unsuspecting 
enthusiasts  who  attended  the  matches.  In  the  third  round  Walter  Hayes  and 
Heath  Kyford  met,  and  Hayes  was  eliminated  in  a  three-set  match,  1/6,7/5,6/3. 
In  the  men"s  doul)les  the  Weber  brothers  furnished  the  greatest  surprise  of  the 
tournament  by  defeating  Hayes  and  Burdick,  Western  doubles  champions,  in  a 
fast  five-set  match,   0/4,2/(>.7/9,6/l,6/4. 

Miss  Dorothy  Higbie,  a  fifteen-year-old  University  High  School  girl,  proved 
the  great  find  of  the  women  tennis  players.  Although  it  was  the  first  year  she 
had  ever  participated  in  a  tournament,  she  defeated  Miss  Mary  K.  Voorhees, 
women's  singles  champion  of  the  Central  West,  6/4.6/4,  and  it  "was  only  after 
a  hard  battle  that  she  fell  before  Miss  Miriam  Steever,  an  older  and  more 
experienced    player,    l/6,7/.'>,6/2. 

Outside  of  the  events  mentioned,  the  results  turned  out  as  the  followers  of 
fthe  game  expected  they  would.  Byford  and  Burdick  were  the  finalists  of  the 
men's  singles,  and  although  Burdick  played  a  brilliant  game,  he  succumbed  to 
the  steadiness  of  his  more  experienced  opponent,  6/3,1/6,0/3,4/6,6/1.  In  the 
men's  doubles  the  Weber  brothers  were  unable  to  keep  up  the  same  brand  of 
tennis  they  played  against  Hayes  and  Burdick,  and  were  disposed  of  with  com- 
parative ease  in  the  finals  by  Green  and  Ketchum, 4/6,6/4, 6/2, 7/5. 
;  In  the  women's  singles  Miss  Carrie  Neely  won,  as  usual,  by  defeating  Miss 
Miriam  Steever  in  the  final  round,  6/3,4/6,6/4.  Miss  Hires  and  Miss  Seavey  of 
Kansas  City  proved  the  strongest  team  of  the  women's  drawings,  defeating  Miss 
Steever  and  Miss  Voorhees  in  the  final  round.  6/8,7/5,6/3.  Mrs.  Malcolm  Mc- 
,Neil   and   Ralph    Burdick   won   the  mixed  doubles. 

I  Interstate  Tournament. — Tho  Interstate  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Minnesota, 
South  Dakota,  Nebraska  and  Iowa  was  played  on  the  courts  of  the  Shoreacre  Club,  Sioux 
Cit.v,  Iowa,  beginning  August  7.  The  matches  were  pulled  through  in  good  shape,  and  the 
tournament  on  the  whole  was  entirely  satisfactory.  The  feature  match  of  the  singles 
came  in  the  semi-final  round  when  Ralph  Powell  defeated  John  Barton,  the  interstate 
champion,  iu  five  rattling  sets,  8/6,2/6,6/2,3/6.6/0.  In  the  final  round,  K.  Berick 
defaulted  to  Powell.  The  final  round  of  the  doubles  was  a  disappointment  as  Barton  and 
Rerlck  simply  ran  away  from  W.  S.  Oilman  and  C.  Carey,  6/3,6/1,6/0. 

Kansas-Oklahoma  Tournament. — The  Kansas-Oklahoma  tournament  attracted  a  good  field 
of  players  and  produced  some  interesting  tennis  on  the  courts  of  the  Wichita  Young  Men's 
Christian  Association.  Wichita,  Kans.,  June  19  to  23.  Charles  Speice  captured  the  honors 
In  the  singles  by  defeating  H.  Gautier  in  the  final  round,  7/5,6/1,6/3.  In  the  doubles,

In  fighting  his  way  to  the  final  round.  The  doubles  event  was  won  by  Theobald  and  Bay- 
miller,  who  defeated  0£C  and  Lovelace  in  the  final  round.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  167 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Washington,  D.  C. 

By  Louis  I.  Dovle. 

More  tennis,  nior(>  kinds  of  tennis  and  better  tennis,  than  in  any  previous  year, 
characterized  that  played  in  Washington  in  1916.  Never  before  was  there  such 
a  good  line  on  the  ranking  of  players.  So  many  were  the  contests  in  the  several 
leagues  and  tournaments,  that,  to  avoid  conflicts,  complete  cooperation  was 
necessary  in  scheduling  matches.  Your  opponent  today  might  tomorrow  be  your 
partner    in    a    different    series    of    matches. 

The  season  opened  April  22,  when  the  Harvard  team  defeated  an  All- Washington 
5  matches  to  2.  C.  B.  Doyle,  within  two  points  of  defeating  Williams  ia 
two  sots,  lost,  4/6,8/(i,(j/4,  the  windy  day  failing  to  mar  the  excellence  of  the 
play,  which  was  probably  Doyle's  best  exhibition  in  Washington.  He  aced 
Williams  in  this  match  fourteen  times  on  service.  Breck  (Washington),  who 
hails  from  California  and  plays  the  game  accordingly,  made  a  very  favorable- 
impression  in  his  first  public  appearance  in  the  District. 

The  Chevy  Chase  invitation  touruament,  beginning  April  29,  brought  to  Wash- 
ington :  I.  C.  Wright,  R.  L.  James  and  Harold  A.  Throckmorton  for  the  singles,. 
and  Willis  E.  Davis,  Albert  E.  Kennedy,  T.  K,  Pell  and  C.  M.  Bull  for  doubles, 
the  last  two  to  defend  their  title. 

In  the  women's  singles.  Miss  Florence  Ballin,  from  New  York,  after  elimi- 
nating Miss  Marguerite  Taylor  of  the  same  city,  lost  to  Miss  Gertrude  Greely, 
Chevy  Chase,  in  the  final  round,  the  latter  then  taking  the  Grosvenor  Cup  by 
defeating  Miss  Eva  Baker,  holder.  Throckmorton  won  the  men's  singles,  sur- 
prising tlie  spectators  by  outserving  C.  B.  Doyle,  and  by  defeating  Breck  in 
the  final  round,  after  nearly  being  eliminated  by  Moorhead  earlier  in  the  tour- 
nament. In  the  doubles  Kennedy  and  Davis  were  too  strong  for  Washing- 
ton's best  pairs,  the  Doyle  brothers  and  Breck  and  Moore,  also  for  Throckmorton 
and  Wright,  but  in  the  ch.nllonge  round  fell  before  Pell  and  Bull,  who  thus 
gained  permanent  possession  of  the  Chevy  Chase  cups,  on  which  the  Doyies  also 
previously    had   two   legs. 

In  the  Middle  Atlantic  tournament  at  Columbia,  starting  May  29,  the  doubles 
were  given  preference  on  account  of  the  out-of-town  entrants.  For  the  first 
time  the  champions  were  to  be  eligible  to  play  in  the  preliminary  national  doubles. 
AH  doubles  matches  were  best  three  of  five  sets,  which  pleased  the  local  players. 
R.  A.  Owen.  W.  C.  Hyde.  B.  F.  Torre.v,  Lieutenant  C.  C.  Gill.  U.S.N.,  E.  H.  Rogers, 
H.  G.  Whitehead  and  Richard  Tunstall  were  the  visiting  players. 

There  was  much  rain  and  the  cement  courts  at  Columbia  and  Chevy  Chase  were 
used.  Breck  and  C.  B.  Doyle  won  the  doubles  by  defeating  in  turn  the  Paul 
Treanor-J.  B.  Moore,  O'Boyle  lirothers.  and  Whitehead-Tunstall  combinations, 
the  last  in  the  final  round,'  with  the  loss  of  only  one  set — that  to  the  Norfolk 
players,  last  named.  Regrettably  the  winners  later  found  it  impossible  to  par- 
ticipate in  the  Chicago  try-outs.  Doyle  won  the  singles,  going  through  six 
matches  of  fifteen  sets  with  the  loss  of  only  thirty-seven  games,  an  average 
of  less  than  three  games  a  s'et,  including  the  final  round,  in  which  he  lost  one 
set  to  Breck.  In  the  fourth  round  .T.  T.  Graves.  Jr..  previously  little  heard  of 
here,  hut  who  was  a  member  of  the  Princeton  University  team,  defeated  Paul  . 
Treanor,  and  was  in  turn  eliminated  by  Breck,  while  Doyle  was  taking  care  of 
Moore.  Miss  Eva  Baker  reversed  the  result  of  the  challenge  round  at  Chevy 
Chase  by  defeating  Miss  Gertrude  Greely,  giving  the  former  permanent  pos- 
session of  the  Lav.-reuoe  O.  Murray  Cup."  Miss  Nellie  Johnson  nearly  defeated 
Miss  Greely  in  the  final  round  match,  which  went  thirty-five  games. 

Columbia  invitation  tournament,  beginning  Septcnilier  2,  was  featured  by  the 
defeat  of  Breck  by  A.  J.  Gore,  and  in  the  final  round  by  the  victory  of  D.  D. 
Morgan  over  Gore,  in  five  sets.  C.  B.  Doyle,  out  of  the  singles,  paired  with 
A.  B.  Ilcaton  in  the  doubles  and  lost  to  Col.  W,  A.  Bethel  and  Gore.  Of  principal 
interest  in  this  match  was  the  way  Ileaton  stood  up  under  the  hammering  hf 
was  forced  to  take,  while  the  ball  was  Iiciug  kept  out  of  Doyle's  reach.  In  th^ 
final  round  Col.  Bethel  and  Gore  defeated  Douglas  Ilillyer  and  G.  G.  Lincoln  in 
a.  good  five-set  match,  the  losers  winning  the  first  two  sets  rather  easily. 
'  For  the  District  championsliip  tournament,  held  at  Dumbarton,  beginning  Sep- 
xember  Iti,  Breck,  C.  B.  Doyle  and  Moore,  the  last  named  the  holder,  were  out 
on  account  of  contlicting  business  engngements.  However.  R.  C.  VanVliet  of 
New  York,  studying  in  Washington,  entered  in  the  singles  only  and  easily  dis- 
posed of  the  Washington  crowd.  He  in  reality  danced  his  way  to  victory  over 
J.  T.  Graves,  Jr.,  in  three  sets  of  t!ie  final  round,  after  smothering  G.  L.  Lewis, 


168  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

L.  I.  Doyle  and  A.  J.  Gore,  all  three  on  the  same  day.  Graves  had  sprung  a 
surprise  by  defeating  Morgan  in  the  semi-final  of  the  other  half.  VanVliet 
played  well  enough  to  give  a  good  account  of  himself  in  the  Metropolitan  and 
National  tournaments.  His  anticipation  of  attack,  footworl<  and  soft,  well- 
placed  chops  v/ere  a  revelation  to  the  Washington  fans.  When  he  drove  or 
smashed  also,  the  results  left  nothing  to  be  desired.  Inaccuracy  of  service  was 
his    only    weakness    shown. 

In  the  doubles  Morgan  and  Lewis,  a  hard-hitting  pair,  were  not  seriously 
threatened  by  any  of  their  opponents  and  won  in  the  final  round  with  the 
loss  of  the  third  set  only.  Lewis,  paired  with  Miss  Blair,  also  won  the  mixed 
doubles. 

Departmental  league  matches  developed  into  a  close  race.  Thirteen  teams  par- 
ticipated, representing  ten  departments,  two  commissions  and  two  independent 
offices.  Two  contests — five  doubles  matches  each — were  played  three  days  each 
week.  Each  team  met  the  others  once.  In  390  matches  257  men  took  part ;  only 
thirteen  matches  were  lost  by  default.  At  the  end  the  three  leading  teams  stood  : 
War  and  Navy  tied  with  47  matches  won  and  13  lost,  and  Treasury  third  with 
4.5  won  and  15  lost.  In  a  post-season  match,  to  decide  the  championship,  War 
won  four  out  of  five  matches  from  Navy.  The  teams  and  final  order  of  standing 
were :  War.  Navy.  Treasury,  Commerce,  Interior,  Commissioners,  Agriculture, 
Interstate,  Justice-Trade,  Smithsonian,  Labor-State,  Post  Office  and  Government 
Printing    Office. 

The  Suburban  Tennis  League,  an  organization  of  eight  small  suburban  clubs, 
played  392  team  matches.  Each  club  met  the  others  twice  in  two  singles 
and  five  doubles  matches.  There  were  309  members,  a  third  of  whom  took 
part  in  the  matches.  Petworth  and  Racquet  ended  the  series  in  a  tie,  each 
having  won  64  and  lost  34  matches.  Of  14  matches  Petworth  had  won  11  from 
Racquet,  but  in  the  play-ofif  to  decide  the  championship  Racquet  took  all  seven. 
The  teams  finished  as  follows :  Racquet,  Petworth,  Princeton  Heights,  Argyle, 
Holmead,  Bureau  of  Standards,  Euclid  and  Home  Club.  R.  C.  VanVliet,  district 
champion,   was  a  member  of  the  winning   team. 

The  Junior  District  championship  was  decided  at  the  Princeton  Heights  Club, 
beginning  June  17.  This  club,  in  an  effort  to  encourage  the  boys,  gave  the 
winners  one-year  memberships  in  the  club.  In  the  finals  of  the  Central  High 
School  tournament,  just  completed,  Harold  P.  Selden  had  defeated  Howard 
H.  Cissel  in  the  final  round.  Selden  repeated  in  the  District  event,  after  de- 
feating Deane  C.  Howard,  holder,  in  the  first  round.  In  the  doubles  final 
Cissel  and  Aubrey  Fischer  defeated  Selden  and  LeFevre.  Both  single  and 
doubles  finalists  were  Central  High  School  players.  In  the  final  of  the  Central 
High  tournament  Selden  and  LeFevre  had  defeated  Cissel  and  Dudley.  Central 
High  team  won  over  all  other  schools,  losing  only  two  individual  matches  of 
twenty-six  played. 

The  Women's  League,  ten  teams,  representing  centers  of  tennis  activity,  played 
265  singles  and  about  128  doubles  team  matches.  Eight  women  represented 
each  section.  Of  131  participants,  an  unusually  large  number  were  young 
players.  To  Miss  E.  L.  Corson,  secretary-treasurer,  largely  belongs  credit  for 
the  success  of  these  matches  and  the  greatly  increased  interest  in  women's 
tennis.  The  other  officers  were :  Miss  Elizabeth  Bryan,  president,  and  Miss 
Alys  Downing,  vice-president.  Mid-City  won  the  singles  title,  with  42  matches 
won  and  19  lost.  The  other  teams  in  the  order  of  ranking  were  :  Columbia 
Country  Club,  Washington  Country  Club,  Washington  Heights,  Chevy  Chase 
Club,  Piney  Branch,  Y.W.C.A.,  High  School,  Mount  Pleasant  and  Departmental. 

The  Home  Club  of  the  Interior  Department,  with  teams  in  the  Departmental 
and  Suburban  Leagues,  conducted  spring  and  fall  tournaments  in  singles  and 
doubles,  also  a  series  of  inter-bureau  team  contests  of  three  singles  and  three 
doubles    matches    each. 

Washington  Railway  and  Electric  Company  held  two  tournaments  for  its 
employes  on  the  company's  courts.  A  scratch  tournament  had  38  entries  in 
singles  and  15  in  doubles  and  a  handicap  event  had  32  singles  and  16  doubles. 

Municipal  clay  courts,  35  in  all — 14  new  ones — located  in  various  parks, 
<:tiowed  their  greatest  activity.  For  their  use  as  many  as  1,300  monthly  permits 
were  issued  by  the  office  of  superintendent  Ot  public  grounds,  representing  9,000 
players.  Twelve  hundred  played  on  a  single  day.  A  great  new  project,  planned 
for  East  Potomac  Park,  south  of  the  city,  on  reclaimed  ground,  includes  a  field 
house  to  cost  fifty  thousand  dollars,  accommodations  for  several  sports,  includ- 
ing 36  tennis  courts.  This  playground  will  be  reached  by  street  cars  whose 
lines  will  be  extended,  and  by  ferryboats  from  steamboat  lindings  opposite  the 
«ite.     A  grass  court  for  championship  matches  will  be  constructed,  also  a  foot-

likely   be   held   in    Washington 

Of  signilicance  was  the  formation  in  the  spring  of  the  Washington  Tennis 
Association  "to  promote  the  general  interest  of  lawn  tennis  in  Washington," 
and.  in  particuhir,  'a  series  of  team  matches  between  its  members."  A.  Y. 
Leech.  Jr.,  donated  a  splendid  trophy,  to  be  won  three  times  before  permanent 
possession.  The  representatives  and  their  clubs  are  :  A.  Y.  Leech,  Jr.,  president, 
Columbia  Club:  James  H.  Hopkins,  Jr.,  vice-president.  Chevy  Chase;  Ezra  Gould, 
treasurer.  Dumbarton;  L.  I.  Doyle,  secretary.  Departmental  League.  New  clubs 
may  be  added  by  consent  of  the  members. 

The  matches  in  lltlC  consisted  of  three  contests  with  each  member — six  singles 
and  three  doubles.  Other  matches  had  brought  out  the  greatest  possible  number 
of  players.  These  were  planned  to  get  the  best  players  in  the  city  in  frequent 
competition.  In  all.  (il  men  played.  Chevy  Chase  had  22,  Columbia  12,  Dum- 
barton 10,  and  Departmental  17.  Those  participating  in  most  of  the  matches 
were  :  Chew  Chase — J.  U.  Moorhead,  Col.  W.  A.  Bethel,  J.  B.  Moore,  W.  G. 
Dunlop,  D.  b.  Morgan,  Arthur  Ilelleu.  Columbia — C.  B.  and  H.  E.  Doyle,  Henry 
C.  Hreck.  A.  Y.  and  E.  O.  Leech,  C.  T.  Chapman,  E.  C.  Graves.  Dumbarton — 
Douglas  Hillver.  A.  J.  Gore.  G.  L.  Lewis,  A.  W.  Howard,  J.  M.  Hancock,  G.  G. 
Lincoln.  Kob'ert  Candor.  Departmental — J.  T.  Graves,  Jr.,  H.  W.  Barber,  H.  E. 
Colton,  K.  C.  Tracy,  G.  C.  Williams,  H.  L.  Buckingham,  L.  I.  Doyle. 

Dumbarton  won  first  place,  taking  7  out  of  9  contests  (one  from  Columbia 
and  three  from  Chevy  Chase  and  Departmental)  ;  Columbia  was  second,  with  6 
won  and  3  lost  (two  from  each  of  the  other  teams)  ;  Departmental  was  third, 
with  3  won  and  (5  lost,  and  Chevy  Chase  fourth,  with  2  won  and  7  lost.  Count- 
ing individual  matches,  Columbia  was  first  with  53  matches  won  and  28  lost, 
with    Dumbarton  winning  50  and   losing  31. 

Two  post-season  contests  were  played,  Columbia  vs.  All- Washington.  In  the 
first  Columbia  won  5  (2  singles  and  3  doubles)  and  lost  4  (all  singles).  In  the 
second.  All- Washington  won  5  (4  singles  and  1  double),  lost  3  (2  singles  and  1 
doulile)  and  tied  one,  a  double,  which  was  stopped  at  one-set-all  by  darkness. 

Of  significance  also  were  the  provisions  in  the  plans  of  promoters  of  real 
estate  and  builders  of  apartment  houses  in  Washington  for  from  two  to  six 
courts  of  clay  or  cement  within  their  property.  The  location  of  these  play- 
grounds for  grownups  is  becoming  a  factor  in  the  selection  of  properties,  as  is 
the  location  of  playgrounds  for  the  use  of  children.  The  winners  in  the  various 
tournameuts    for    iyi6    follow :

170  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Lawn  Tennis  in  the  United  States  Navy 

By   Lieut.   C.  C.    Gill.  U.S.N. 

Tennis  has  always  been  a  popular  sport  among  naval  Officers,  but  in  recent 
years  there  has  been  particularly  lively  recruiting  of  naval  devotees  to  the 
service  of  the  racket  and  ball.  This  is  partly  due  to  interest  in  the  tennisi 
team  and  the  development  of  good  tennis  at  the  Naval  Academy,  partly  to  the 
addition  of  tennis  tournaments  to  the  officially  listed  Atlantic  Fleet  sports,  andi 
partly   to  the  generally   increased   interest   in   tennis   felt   everywhere. 

Tennis  is  essentially  the  game  for  naval  officers  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  In' 
the  first  place,  the  demand  for  hcadwork,  as  well  as  physical  activity,  naturally! 
appeals  and  attracts.  The  phrase  "tennis  tactics"  at  once  calls  to  mind  the' 
phrase  "naval  tactics,"  and,  when  one  stops  to  think  of  it,  there  is  a  surprising 
similarity  in  the  pointers  a  fellow  has  to  look  out  for  both  in  playing  tennisi 
and  in  practicing  naval  tactics.  For  instance,  in  both  we  strive  for  initial 
advantage ;  superiority  in  speed  and  endurance ;  to  get  at  the  other  fellow's 
weakness  and  hammer  away  at  it ;  to  cover  up  one's  own  weaknesses  and 
maneuver  so  as  to  get  into  play  one's  most  effective  artillery — and  so  on. 

Another  reason  why  naval  officers  like  tennis  is  that  a  court  is  almost  always 
handy  and  the  demand  on  limited  time,  and  usually  limited  pocketbooks,  is  not 
excessive. 

Still  another  advantage  is.  that  in  foreign  ports  there  is  nothing  like  a  game; 
of  tennis  to  break  the  ice  of  formality  and  strangeness.  Even  the  barrier  of. 
speaking  different  languages  disappears  after  a  good  match,  and  intimate 
relations  are  at  once  established.  This  was  particularly  noticed  on  the  round- 
the-world  cruise  of  the  White  battleship  fleet  in  1907.  Among  my  pleasantest 
recollections  of  this  cruise  are  remembrances  of  tennis  at  Trinidad,  Rio  Janeiro, 
Lima,  Honolulu,  Auckland,  Sydney,  Melbourne,  Manila,  Yokohama,  Colombo, 
Nice,  and  Gibraltar. 

Atlantic  Fleet  Championships 

During  the  fleet's  "Hundred  Days"  in  the  South  the  tennis  championship  is, 
contested  on  courts  of  the  Officers'  Club  at  Guantanamo,  Cuba.  Each  vessel 
is  allowed  one  man  in  the  singles  tournament  and  one  team  In  the  doubles. 
The  results  of  the  1915-16  contests  were  as  follows:

By   C.   H.    Foster,  In.stuuctor  and  Tennis  Coach. 

Organized  tennis  at  the  U.  S.  Naval  Academy  is  under  the  Immediate  direc- 
tion of  the  tennis  coach  and  the  general  direction  of  the  officer  in  charge  ol 
athletics.  Althouch  tennis  is  played  by  five  or  six  hundred  midshipmen,  on 
nearly  thirty  courts,  the  organized  game  is  confined  to  the  five-team  courts  ana 
to  the  tennis   squad   of   si.vteen    players. 

The  tennis  coach  begins  work  in  July  or  August,  when  he  calls  together  those 
members  of  the  new  fourth  class  who  inti  nd  to  go  out  for  tennis.  After  electing 
a  captain  and  a  nianagir,  the  squad  listen  to  a  short  talk  by  the  coach.  He 
explains  the  Id'-als  of  fairness,  grit,  and  head  work  that  tennis  develops,  and 
points  out  the  need  of  a  .sound  technique  by  every  player  who  wishes  to  Im- 
prove. As  a  foundation  for  their  technique  he  urges  them  to  try  always  for 
correct  foot  pcsition,  swing,  and  constant  focus  on  the  ball.  But  In  style 
and  also  in  choice  of  racket  they  are  advised  to  avoid  extremes. 

The  next  step  is  selecting  the  squad.  This  is  done  in  a  tournament  the 
details  of  which  are  handled  by  the  captain  and  manager  under  the  coach's 
direction.  The  top  sixteen  men,  in  order  of  tournament  merit,  are  then  posted 
near  the  team  courts,  with  each  man's  name  on  a  separate  paddle.  If  a  man 
fails  to  make  the  squad  or  is  not  properly  ranked,  he  has  two  more  ways  of 
getting  his  right  place.  If  he  makes  a  good  showing  in  the  inter-company  tour- 
nament— which  is  held  toward  the  end  of  the  sumnn^r — he  is  given  another 
chance  against  members  of  the  .squad.  Or  he  may  challenge  according  to  the 
following  rules  :  any  man  on  the  squad  may  challenge  either  of  the  two  men 
next  above  him  and.  if  ho  wins  iu  such  a  challenge  match,  take  the  higher 
place.  If  he  is  challenged  at  the  same  time  he  challenges,  he  plays  the  man 
above  him  first,  and  if  successful  does  not  ha\e  to  play  the  man  below.  Any  man 
not  on  the  squad  may  challenge  any  of  the  four  low  men  on  the  squad  and  if 
successful  take  the  higher  place.  If  a  man  is  challenged  he  must  play  within 
three  playing  days  or  default.  In  this  way  the  fourth  class  tennis  squad  is  made 
up  in  the  summer.  And  in  practically  the  same  way  the  coach  in  the  fall  makes 
up  tile  navy  tennis  squad,  sifting  out,  from  all  four  classes,  the  best  sixteen 
of  those  interested  in  tennis — and  always  keeping  the  competition  open. 

All  playing  on  the  courts  is  under  the  supervision  of  the  coach.  Where 
necessary  "he  warns  against  footfaulting  and  other  breaches  of  tennis  conven- 
tions. No  one  set  way  of  playing  is  insisted  upon,  but  every  one  on  the  squad 
is  shown  how  to  improve  the  form  of  his  own  strokes  without  changing  his 
style.  A  freo-swinging,  confident  style  is  recommended  as  more  likely  to  improve 
one's  game  than  premature  anxiety  to  win  points.  Since  smashing  seems  to  be 
the  weakest  stroke  of  most  midshipmen,  the  coach  lays  special  stress  on  work- 
ing up  this  detail.  These  are  some  of  the  points  treated  :  anticipating  lobe 
from  certain  positions,  running  for  position  quicklij,  taking  correct  "stvince," 
stepping  into  tht?  stroke,  following  through,  eyes  on  the  ball  where  the  racket 
is  going  to  hit  it.  eyes  not  on  the  oth,^r  court  where  the  ball  is  expected  to 
strike,  and  all  of  these  things  to  be  done  o|)tiiiiistically,  with  certainty  and  con- 
viction of  success.  Scale  practice  is  required  by  the  coach  of  every  man  on 
the  squad  ;  for  instance,  twenty  smashes  each  day  before  playing,  for  a  week, 
with  a   record  of  each  day's   percentage  of  square   hits  into  court. 

The  foregoing  is  merely  an  outline  of  our  training  in  stroke  form.  Both  with 
the  smash  and  with  other  strokes  faults  are  pointed  out — also  the  antidotes — 
as  soon  as  they  show  themselves.  Other  points  of  tactics,  strategy  and  psy- 
chology are  mastered  as  well  as  the  ability  of  players  and  coach  permits  (our 
aim  is  to  keep  a  nuiu  on  the  upgrade  whil(>  in  the  .Vcademy,  so  that  he  will  not 
liave  to  unlearn  anything  later).  But  in  all  of  our  training  and  practice  lack  of 
time  is  a  serious  handicap.  Academy  tennis,  though  organized,  has  to  fight 
for  existence  against  demands  for  study  time  and  interest  in  many  other  forms 
of  athletics.  Our  aim.  however,  is  to  keen  a  midshipman  on  the  upgrade,  so 
that  he  will  not  have  to  unlearn  anything  later. 


172  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Baltimore 

By  Robert  P.  Ashley, 

President  of  the  Interpark  Tennis  Association  and  of  the  Associated  Tennis 

Clubs  ol  Baltimore. 

Tennis  is  coming  into  its  own  in  Baltimore.  With  the  organization  of  the 
Interparli  Tennis  Association  in  the  fall  of  1915,  a  movement  of  far  reaching 
importance  to  the  success  of  Baltimore  as  a  tennis  center  was  begun.  i 

Many  players  gravitated  to  the  public  courts,  and  during  the  seasons  of  1914 
and  1915  it  was  noticed  that  in  Patterson  Park  and  Clifton  Park  two  associa- 
tions of  much  playing  and  numerical  strength  had  sprung  up.  An  interpark 
rivalry  ensued  between  the  two,  which  broadened  out  into  competition  between 
clubs  and  parks  and  stimulated  the  formation  of  associations  in  the  other  public 
parks  supporting  adequate  tennis  conveniences,  such  as  Druid  Hill  Park,  Carroll 
Park.  Easterwood  Park  and  Latrobe  Park.  At  the  close  of  the  season  of  1915 
these  six  park  associations  federated  into  the  Interpark  Tennis  Association  for 
the  purpose  of  advancing  the  interests  of  tennis  in  the  parks  in  every  way. 

When  the  season  opened  and  the  park  championship  tournament  began  on 
June  24,  it  was  found  that  the  event  had  attracted  one  of  the  largest  entry 
lists  ever  recorded  here,  sixty-four  entries.  It  was  an  unusually  successful  affair 
and  was  completed  on  the  following  Saturday,  when  Albert  Hobelmann  of  Pat- 
terson Park  defeated  his  team-mate,  Stuart  Hihn.  8/6.6/2,6/1,  thereby  winning 
the  association  trophy  and  getting  one  leg  on  the  McCallister  Challenge  Cup. 

Soon  after  this  event,  and  through  the  instrumentalit.v  of  Mr.  Frederick  C. 
Colston,  fermer  champion  of  Maryland,  the  Interpark  Tennis  Association  was 
elected  to  membership  in  the  TT.S.N.L.T.A.,  which  sharpened  our  appetites  for 
bigger  game  and  better.  We  held  a  boys'  tournament  of  ninety  entries,  playing 
the  event  off  in  sections.  This  was  won  by  Teddv  Bandel  of  Mount  Washing- 
ton Club  when  he  defeated  Robert  Becker  of  Druid  Hill  Park,  .5/7,8/6,6/3,6/0. 
A  few  days  later  Bandel  was  defeated  in  the  finals  of  the  Middle  Atlantic  sec- 
tional boys'  championship  by  George  T.  Wilson  of  Wheeling.  W.  Va.,  at  the  Balti- 
more Country  Club,  6/4,4/6,6/4,6/4.  Following  this  a  doubles  tournament  for 
boys  was  held  in  which  Neun  and  Fody  of  Patterson  Park  "cleaned  up,"  as  they 
expressed  it. 

Beginning  July  5  the  Baltimore  Country  Club  held  a  tournament  for  juniors 
which  was  won  by  T.  W.  Allen,  who  defeated  J.  Fell,  6/2,7/5,6/0.  There  were 
eighteen  contestants  and  the  .youngsters  showed  quite  an  aptitude  for  the  game. 

On  August  19  the  intercity  matches,  under  the"  auspices  of  the  Interpark  Ten- 
nis Association  and  under  the  direction  of  the  National  Municipal  Recreation 
Federation,  were  held.  Baltimore  entertained  Hartford,  New  York  and  Worcester, 
the  New  York  team,  composed  of  Louis  Oshman  and  Louis  Joffe,  showing  sufficient 
individual  and  team  superiority  over  their  opponents  to  win  out. 

Following  this,  and  as  a  fitting  climax  to  the  season,  a  women's  tournament 
was  held  so  successfully  that  its  repetition  is  urged.  Miss  Mary  Canoles  of 
Clifton  Park  defeated  Miss  Lola  Patenall  of  Druid  Hill  Park  in  the  finals. 

The  activity  of  the  Interpark  Tennis  Association  had  the  expected  effect  on 
tennis  in  general  in  Baltimore.  Late  in  the  season  the  Mount  Washington 
Club,  one  of  the  oldest  and  best  of  the  local  clubs,  arranged  an  open  club  tourna- 
ment, offering  several  handsome  trophies.  That  the  club  players  as  well  as  the 
park  players  had  been  "hankering"  for  just  such  a  stimulus  is  proved  by  the 
fact  that  this  event  attracted  sixty-four  entries— the  best  of  the  playing 
strength  of  this  city. 

The  rest  of  the  story  is  briefly  told.  On  the  twenty-third  of  January,  1917, 
at  the  Hotel  Emerson,  the  Associated  Tennis  Clubs  was  organized,  with  the 
Baltimore  Country  Club,  Mount  Washington  Club,  Maryland  Athletic  Club.  Mary- 
land Swimming  Club,  Stony  Run  Country  Club,  Interpark  Tennis  Association, 
Maryland  Country  Club  and  West  Forest  Park  Tennis  Club  as  charter  members. 
Several  days  later  Suburban  Club  and  Sparrows  Point  Club  were  added. 

It  is  the  aim  of  the  Associated  Tennis  Clubs  of  Baltimore  to  influence  for 
good  every  phase  of  tennis  activity  in  this  city,  touching  every  nook  and  corner, 
high  and  low,  school,  college,  park,  club,  boys,  juniors,  men  and  women.  The 
primary  idea  is  to  form  two  leagues  of  four  teams  each  and  the  scheme  con- 
templates a  post-season  series  between  the  league  winners,  and,  finally,  it  is 
hoped  that  an  intercity  series  with  the  Washington  Tennis  Association  can  be 
arranged.  The  Associated  Tennis  Clubs  hope  also  to  arrange  a  tennis  programme 
for  each  club  so  that  continuous  tennis  activity  will  be  enjoyed. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  173 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Detroit  and  Vicinity 

By   X.   II.   BowEN 

The  annual  fixtures  in  the  way  of  tournaments  were  very  successful,  particu- 
larly in  bringing  to  light  one  brand-new  star  and  showing  marked  improvement 
in  the  play  of  others  Walter  Westbrook.  who  first  attracted  attention  by  win- 
ning the  city  high  school  title  in  1915,  made  quite  a  record  of  winnings.  He 
8t:irti>d  off  by  taking  the  Detroit  Tennis  Club's  handicap  tournament,  followed 
this  by  winning  both  the  junior  and  senior  city  titles  in  both  singles  and  doubles, 
and  later  in  the  year  .«howed  his  increasing  ability  by  winning  the  junior  cham- 
pionship of  the  Middle  Western  section,  and  making  a  good  showing  in  the 
national  junior  at  New  York, 

Westbrook's  opponent  in  the  city  senior  final  was  Theodore  Lightner,  whom 
he  boat,  10/8, tJ/4,7/9, 7/5,  the  match  being  very  close.  These  players  also  won 
the  doubles  title,  their  opponents  in  the  final  being  Ira  Reindel.  former  city 
champion,  and  Carl  Raseman.     The  scores  were  G/3, 2/6, 4/6, 7/5, 7/5. 

In  the  citv  junior  final  Westbrook  trimmed  George  Stocking  in  straight  sets, 
and  in  the  doubles  these  two  beat  Robert  Angell  and  Stewart  Frasor.  A  number 
of  the  boys  contesting  showed  considerable  promise,  and  the  success  of  the 
junior  event  for  the  future  was  assured  by  the  enthusiastic  reception  it  was 
accorded   by   the  youngsters. 

At  Chicago,  in  the  District  Junior,  Westbrook  defeated  Roger  Carver,  one  of 
the  best  Middle  West  youngsters,  in  a  very  close  five-set  struggle,  and  then 
beat  .Tinmiy  Weber,  former  captain  of  the  Andover  team,  in  a  straight-set  match. 
€/4,6/3,(!/2.  At  New  York  the  Detroit  boy  ran  up  against  Roland  Rolierts  and 
was  beaten,  7/5.6/4.7/5,  a  fine  showing  when  it  is  considered  that  he  had  never 
before  played  on  grass. 

The  greatest  victory  Detroit  ever  won  in  inter-city  tennis  was  scored  in  August, 
when  the  Detroit  Tennis  Club  six-man  team  defeated  the  teams  of  the  Toledo 
Tennis  Club,  Park  Club  of  Buffalo,  and  East  End  Tennis  Club  of  Cleveland  in 
a  two-day  tournament.  The  first  day  Cleveland  gave  the  strong  Buffalo  team  a 
decisive  defeat,  while  the  Detroiters  were  winning  from  their  old  Toledo  rivals. 
The  play-off  for  first  place  on  the  second  day  seemed  easy  for  Cleveland,  but 
the  predictions  were  all  upset.  Theodore  Lightner  played  about  the  best  game 
of  his  career  and  beat  Charlie  Benton,  6/2,G/2,  Westbrook  beat  former  Cleveland 
Champion  Reed,  lO/S.6/3,  and  all  the  other  Detroit  men  won  their  singles  ex- 
cept one.  This  decided  the  match,  though  Detroit  also  won  one  of  the  two 
doubles  matches  played.  The  Detroit  team  consisted  of  Lightner,  Westbrook, 
Ira  Reindi'l.  Dean  Emerson.  J.  L.  Hibbard  and  R.  G.  Owen,  the  latter  being 
captain.  This  was  Detroit's  first  victory  since  the  Interlake  League  was 
formed.  Buffalo  and  Cleveland  having  each  "a  leg  on  the  cup. 

The  Michigan  State  tournament,  also  played  on  the  Detroit  Tennis  Club  courts, 
resulted  in  victories  for  outside  talent.  In  the  men's  singles  there  was  a  field 
which  included  about  a  dozen  players  who  were  very  evenly  matched.  M,  G. 
Ketchum  of  Chicago,  who  was  regarded  by  many  as  the  logical  favorite,  was  over- 
contident  and  careless  and  was  eliminated  in  the  first  round  by  a  third-class 
Di>troit  player,  Raymond  Bauble.  Jimmy  Weber  was  eliminated  by  Nicolas 
Garcia,  the  Detroit  Filipino.  6/8.6/3,9/7.  Meantime  Reindel  defeated  Westbrook 
in  a  close  match. 3/6.6/4.6/3,  and  J.  B.  Lee.  a  former  Georgian,  conquered  Theo- 
dore Lightner,  (!/4,l/6.7/5.  In  the  semi-finals  Daniel  Kicfer,  Jr..  of  Cincinnati, 
who  had  not  been  hard  pressed  up  to  that  time,  defeated  Reindel,  6/2,2/6,6/3, 
and  Garcia  won  two  very  close  sets  from  Lee.  The  final  was  well  contested. 
Kief.T  winning.  2/6.6/0.7/5,4/6.6/1.  Garcia  is  a  great  place-shot  player  and 
would  rank  pretty  high  if  he  could  hit  the  ball  harder  and  had  a  good  drive. 
Kiefer  was  steady  and  had  enough  speed  to  keep  the  Filipino  on  the  defensive 
much   of  the  time. 

The  nv^'i's  doubles  went  to  Ketchum  and  Weber,  from  whom  Lightner  and 
Wpstbrook  took  one  set  and  nearly  got  a  second.  Mrs.  Walter  Ellis  of  Chicago 
took  the  ladles'  singles  from  a  very  strong  field.  Miss  Katherine  Voorhees  of 
Chicago,  fresh  from  a  fine  showing  in  the  Western  championships,  was  elimi- 
nated by  Mrs.  E.  L.  Thirlby  of  Traverse  City,  an  Englishwoman,  and  Miss  Buda 
Stephens  of  Toledo,  1915"  champion,  was  beaten  by  Mrs.  W.  C.  Miller  of 
Chicago.  Mrs.  Ellis  beat  Mrs.  Miller  in  the  semi-final,  and  then  met  Mrs. 
Thirlby.  whom  she  beat,  6/4.5/7,6/1.  in  a  splendid  match.  Miss  Voorhees 
and  Miss  Amanda  Falker  of  Chicago  won  the  women's  doubles,  and  Mrs.  Ellis 
and  M.  G.   Ketchum   the  mixed  doubles. 


174  -  SPALDING'S    t,awN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Louisville 

By  CuiT  C.  Young. 

The  tennis  season  of  1916  at  Louisville  was  another  very  successful  one, 
despite  the  fact  that  at  the  last  moment  the  Bi-State  tournament  was  aban- 
doned because  of  a  conflict  of  dates  which  would  have  prevented  the  presence 
of  a  majority  of  the  high-class  players  who  have  always  taken  part  in  the 
competition.  The  other  three  tournaments,  however,  filled  well  and  play  was 
close  and  interesting.  In  each  event  a  new  champion  came  through  in  the  men's 
singles.  In  the  Kentucky  State  tournament.  George  Eager,  holder  of  title,  fell 
before  Shclton  Arterburn.  a  former  holder,  while  George  King  of  New  York  City 
captured  the  honors  in  the  Falls  Cities  tournament.  In  the  Cherokee  event  Victor 
Goddard.  the  holder,  did  not  participate  and  the  title  went  to  Kenneth  Bixby. 
Harry  Grinstead,  former  holder  of  all  three  titles,  was  absent  from  the  city 
all  summer.  In  the  State  tournament  Miss  Madelle  Lyons  again  captured 
the  championship.  This  was  her  fifth  consecutive  victory,  she  having  never 
been  defeated  since  the  tournament  was  organized  in   1912. 

The  Louisville  Tennis  League  only  played  a  short  season  and  then  wound 
up  with  a  thi-ee-day  tournament.  Play  was  very  close,  but  the  big  silver  trophy 
was  finally  captured  by  the  Anchorage  Country  Club,  with  the  Standard  club 
in    second    place. 

The  attempt  to  establish  indoor  tennis  was  not  a  pronounced  success.  Ex- 
cellent courts,  patterned  exactly  after  those  in  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory 
in  New  York,  were  built  in  the  huge  First  Regiment  Armory,  but  for  some 
reason  the  movement  did  not  arouse  much  interest.  However,  the  courts  have 
been  reopened.

The  tenth   annual    tournament   of    the   Falls   City    Tennis  Club    was   held   on

Denver  City  Championships 

The  third  annnal  tournament  for  the  championships  of  Denver,  held  on  the 
municipal  courts  at  city  park,  proved  to  be  the  most  successful  yet  held,  not- 
withstanding the  adverse  weather  conditions.  Don  Barker  won  the  men's 
singles  title,  going  through  the  tourney  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  He  d-^feated 
Richard  Scott,  Jr.,  1915  champion,  in  the  semi-final  round,  mainly  through 
effective  lobbing.  Darker  met  B.  R.  Bailey,  the  Capitol  Club  star,  in  the  final, 
defeating  him.  6/3,6/3,6/2.  The  semi-final  match  between  E.  R.  Bailey  and 
Kennedy  Boardman  was  hotly  contested,  Bailey  finally  winning,  6/4,4/6,5/7,6/1. 
6/2.  Ed  and  Neil  King  won  the  men's  doubles,  defeating  Posner  and  Wickersham 
In  the  final  round,  2/6,6/3,7/5,6/1.  Neil  King,  a  seventeen-year-old  boy,  played 
stellar  tennis  throughout  and  will  bear  watching  in  future  tourneys.  Addie 
Cronan,  playing  championship  tennis  in  all  her  matches,  won  the  women's  singles 
title,  defeating  Stella  Oberlander,  the  North  Denver  champion,  in  the  final, 
6/4,6/2.  Paired  with  Mae  Meyer,  1915  champion,  she  added  to  her  glory  by 
winning  the  women's  doubles  title.  A  consistent,  steady  game  carried  the  pair 
to  victory  bv  a  safe  margin.  In  the  final  round  they  easily  disposed  of  Adelaide 
Pivan  and  Mildred  McKim,   6/3,6/0. 

E.  R.  Bailey  managed  the  tournament  and  much  of  its  success  may  bo 
attributed  to  his  efiforts.

The  first  Missouri  Valley  Preliminary  Sectional  Doubles  tournament  was  held 
under  the  auspices  of  the  "Triple  A"  Club  during  the  weelj  of  the  Central  States 
Tournament,    July    3. 

The  two  events  being  held  at  the  same  time,  with  such  players  entered  as  I. 
Kumagae  and  II.  Mikami  of  Japan  ;  J.  S.  Cannon,  Kenneth  Uhls,  Walter  Newell, 
A.  Wester,  and  Dix  Teachenor  of  Kansas  City  ;  E.  Monnett  and  Darrough  of  Okla- 
homa ;  H.  P.  Gautier  and  J.  H.  McCune  of  Kansas  ;  A.  Lindauer  of  Chicago ; 
L.  A.  Wherle  of  Belleville ;  F.  Alden  of  Anna ;  F.  Benson  of  Danville,  111. ;  H.  C. 
Grinstead  of  Louisville,  Ky. ;  Drummond  Jones,  Roland  M.  Hoerr  and  A.  Von 
Keppert  of  Triple  A,  and  Taylor  Ward,  Fred  A.  Josties  and  Theo.  Drewes  of 
Municipal  Court  fame.  The  tournaments  were  the  most  successful  and  drew  the 
largest  galleries  of  any   ever   held  in   St.   Louis. 

The  Triple  A  tennis  committee,  ably  assisted  by  Mr.  Dwight  F.  Davis  as 
official  referee,  handled  the  tournament  in  such  an  efficient  manner  that  they 
were  highly  complimented  by  both  players  and  spectators  alike. 

In  the  singles  of  the  Central  States,  I.  Kumagae  and  Roland  M.  Hoerr  fought 
their  way  to  the  finals,  Kumagae  defeating  George  Broeker,  R.  G.  Metcalf,  W.  H. 
Bowman,  Kenneth  Uhls  and  J.  S.  Cannon  ;  in  the  lower  half  Hoerr  defeated 
E.  B.  Harris,  J.  R.  Hollinshead,  H.  C.  Grinstead.  H.  Mikami  and  Paul  Darrough. 
In  the  finals,  a  gallery  of  six  thousand  saw  their  favorite,  Hoerr,  go  down  to 
defeat  before  the  visiting  Japanese  after  three  hard  sets,  6/3,6/3.6/2. 

In  the  Central  Doubles,  Kumagae  and  Mikami  and  Gautier  and  Reppert  won 
their  way  to  the  finals,  the  Japs  defeating  Rice  and  Newcomb,  Tucker  and 
Hollinshead.  Cannon  and  Lindauer,  Teachenor  and  Newell,  while  Reppert  and 
Gautier  dispo.sed  of  Metcalf  and  Harris,  Macdonald  and  Hercules,  Josties  and 
Drewes.  In  the  finals,  Gautier  and  Reppert  put  up  a  game  fight,  but  the  steadi- 
ness of  the  Orientals  was  too  much  for  them,  the  score  being  6/2,7/5,6/1. 
■>  The  Sectional  Doubles  brought  the  same  players  together  as  in  the  Central, 
the  draw  only  being  somewhat  different,  with  Cannon  and  Lindauer  in  the 
lower  half  and  Reppert  and  Gautier  in  the  upper  half,  along  with  the  two 
Japanese  players.  They  met  in  the  semi-finals  and  seemingly  profited  by  their 
experience  in   the  Central,  giving  the  visitors  a  harder   fight,    6/3,7/5,8/6. 

I  Cannon  and  Lindauer  won  their  way  to  the  finals,  their  hardest  match  being 
with  Teachenor  and  Newell.  Teachenor  and  Newell  won  the  first  two  sets,  bat 
could  not  stand  the  pace  and  lost  the  next  three,  4/6,4/6,6/3,6/3,6/3.  Cannon 
and  I-indauer,  on  the  following  day,  met  Kumagae  and  Mikami  in  the  finals, 
the  Ititter  losing  the  first  set  after  a  hard  fight  in  which  some  pretty  tennis 
was  displayed  by  both  sides.  The  Japanese  won  the  second  set,  but  in  the 
third  and  fourth  sets  Cannon  and  Lindauer  played  the  prettiest  and  most 
effective  tennis  of  the  tournament  and,  to  the  surprise  of  the  gallery,  defeated 
the  visitors  and  earned  the  right  to  continue  towards  the  national  champion- 
ship,  the  final   score  being   7/5,2/6,6/3,6/3. 


178~       -  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  Triple  A  championship  might  be  called  a  complete  victory  for  the 
younger  players,  Walter  Crunden  defeating  Drummond  Jones ;  Taylor  Ward, 
one  of  the  youngest  players,  defeated  A.  Von  Reppert  and  Roland  M.  Hoerr  and 
then  fell  before  Walter  Bowman,  who  reached  the  finals  with  W.  Crunden,  Bow- 
man being  returned  the  club  champion,  3/0,6/4,7/5,6/3. 

In  the  doubles  the  older  players  fared  better,  Jones  and  Hoerr  and  Holthaus 
and  Reppert  reaching  the  finals,  the  former  winning,  6/2,7/5,3/6,6/3. 

The  Triple  A  Club,  seeing  the  interest  among  the  younger  players,  put  on  a 
tournament  for  boys  under  sixteen  years  and  offered  two  handsome  cups  for 
competition.  Edwin  Thursby  and  W.  D.  Brown  succeeded  in  reaching  the 
finals  and,  as  it  happened,  the  smallest  boy  in  the  tournament  was  pitted 
against  the  largest,  but,  small  as  he  was.  Brown  made  the  big  fellow  go 
the  five  sets  before  he  could  claim  the  honor  of  being  the  first  junior  tennis  cham- 
pion of  the  city.  Some  good  tennis  was  displayed  during  the  week  by  the 
youngsters  and,  from  indications,  St.  Louis,  within  a  few  years,  may  be  knock- 
ing at  the  door  of  the  national  championships  again. 

The  City  Tennis  Championship  was  held  under  he  auspices  of  the  "Triple  A" 
and  was  really  a  contest  between  the  younger  element  in  tennis  and  the  older 
stars,  with  the  advantage  in  favor  of  the  youngsters  until  the  finals. 

Theo.  R.  Drewes,  the  young  "Muny"  player,  successfully  fought  his  way  to  the 
finals  in  the  singles,  disposing  of  W.  G.  Drozda,  Chas.  Perry,  R.  M.  Hoerr,  A. 
Schwarz  and  Von  Reppert.  Clarence  Gamble,  who  represented  the  older  players, 
succeeded  in  reaching  the  finals  by  defeating  A.  P.  Burgess,  C.  E.  Rader,  L.  A. 
Wherle,  Tom  Bronaugh  and  Drummond  Jones. 

Gamble  was  the  favorite  in  the  finals  on  account  of  the  splendid  tennis  he 
had  displayed  during  the  week.  Drewes  put  up  his  usual  game  fight  and  fought 
Gamble  to  deuce  sets,  two-all.  In  the  fifth  set  Gamble  was  a  little  stronger 
and  his  terrific  serve  won  him  the  fifth  set  and  the  championship,  for  which 
he  had  tried  for  years. 

In  the  doubles  the  two  young  "Muny"  players,  Josties  and  Drewes,  succeeded 
in  reaching  the  finals,  defeating  Niewohner  and  Mellow,  Macdonald  and  Winsby, 
Rice  and  Blatterman,  and  Riesmeyer  and  Perry.  In  the  lower  half  Jones  and 
Hoerr  succeeded  in  reaching  the  finals,  disposing  of  Sing  and  Minnegrode,  Werre 
and  Drozda,  Schwarz  and  Linn,  and  Ward  and  Smithers. 

In  the  finals  both  teams  played  almost  perfect  tennis.  The  experience  of 
Jones  and  Hoerr,  however,  told  against  the  youngsters,  but  they  made  the  older 
stars  play  the  five  sets  before  they  were  returned  winners. 

The  Municipal  Tennis  Association  held  a  tournament  on  their  courts  and 
from  among  the  winners  in  the  different  parks  the  team  to  represent  St.  Louis 
in  singles  and  doubles  were  to  be  selected.  In  order  that  no  player  would  have 
an  advantage  in  play,  the  play-off  for  the  selection  of  th'>  team  was  held  on  the 
Triple  A  courts.  Taylor  Ward  and  Theo.  Drewes  won  the  honor  of  playing 
in  the  singles,  and  Drewes  and  his  partner,  Fred  O.  Josties,  won  the  honor  in 
the  doubles,  and  in  the  finals  of  the  National  Municipal  Recreation  Federation, 
which  was  held  on  the  Municipal  courts  in  Forest  Park,  they  won  for  their 
city  the  first  Muny  tennis  championship  in  singles  and  doubles  by  defeating 
Louis  Joffe  and  Louis  Oshman  of  New  York,  who  had  won  the  right  to  meet 
them  by  defeating  the  other  teams  in  the  Federation. 

Border  States  Championships. — J.  B.  Adoue,  Jr.,  and  George  V.  Peak  of  Dallas,  Tex. 
carried  off  the  honors  in  the  fifth  annual  tournament  for  the  Border  States  championships' 
held  on  the  courts  of  the  Tucson  Golf  and  Country  Club,  Tucson,  Ariz.,  during  the  week 
of  May  10.  Adoue  defeated  Peak  in  the  final  round  of  singles  after  a  neck  and  neck 
struggle,  5/7,7/5,4/6,7/5,6/4.  This  pair  won  the  doubles  over  N.  A.  Ferguson  and  H  B 
Christie  in  the  final  round,  5/7,6/3,6/1,7/5.  Miss  Margaret  Chesney  defeated  Miss  Marion 
Allison  in  the  final  round  of  women's  singles,  6/4.4/6,6/4,  and  the  women's  doubles  went 
to  Miss  Florence  Allison  and  Virginia  Lyne,  who  defeated  Miss  Chesney  and  Miss  Butler 
in  the  final  round,  6/1,6/8,6/2.  Henry  Pappen  won  the  veterans'  singles  and  Neff  and 
Cooley  the  doubles.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  179 

National  Municipal  Recreation  Federation 
Intercity  Matches 

The  increasing  popularity  of  tennis  is  proven  by  the  remarkable  growth  of 
he  Kame  in  parks  and  public  recreation  srotinds.  I'layers  by  the  thousands 
re  now  using  such  facilities  for  the  sport  as  the  cities  provide,  whereas  only  a 
ew  years  ago  a  municipal  tennis  court  was  something  of  a  curiosity. 

Three  widely  separated  cities  will  show  that  that  is  no  local  tendency.  In 
Vasliinston,  I).  C,  last  season  there  were  more  than  9,000  permits  for  players 
0  use  public  courts  ;  in  Cleveland,  Ohio,  more  than  12,000  ;  in  St.  Louis,  Mo., 
acre  than  L'O.OiOO.  In  view  of  this  large  number  it  is  significant  that  St.  Louis 
roa  the  championship  of  the  United  States  among  players  using  public  courts. 

The  organization  of  the  National  Municipal  Kecreation  Federation  made  pos- 
Ible  intercity  competition  for  this  national  title.  The  federation  is  largely  the 
utgrowth  of  the  interest  in  municipal  athletics  taken,  by  Dwight  F.  Davis,  who. 
s  park  commissioner,  did  much  to  develop  St.  Louis'  fine  system  of  municipal 
thletics. 

This  was  formed  last  spring  a-t  a  meeting  in  St.  Louis  which  brought  together 
,  largo  number  of  men  interested  in  parks  and  public  recreation.  Golf  and 
ennis  were  chosen  as  the  sports  with  which  to  make  a  beginning  ;  the  plan  is 
o  include  other  branches  of  athletics  as  the  federation  develops.  Although  a 
tart  had  to  be  made  late  in  the  season  and  time  was  lost  ia  getting  in  touch 
rlth  the  proper  men  in  each  city,  a  good  beginning  was  made. 

The  plan  was  to  arrange  the  cities  by  sections,  so  that  they  might  play  for  a 
actional  championship  among  themselves  and  thus  keep  traveling  expenses  at  a 
ninlmum.  Then  the  sectional  winners  were  -to  meet  for  the  right  to  play  St. 
.ouis,  which  was  accorded  the  honor  of  standing  out  last  season  in  the  position 
if  champion  city.  The  U.S.N.L.T.A.  provided  a  handsome  silver  cup  as  a  perma- 
lent  trophy  for  the  tennis  competition,  now  held  by  St.  Louis,  and  Walter  D. 
rhompson  of  St,  Louis  gave  the  golf  trophy. 

In  each  city  tournaments  were  held  in  the  public  parks  to  determine  -the  city's 
■eprosentatives.  Members  of  tennis  clubs  were  barred,  as  it  is  the  plan  of  the 
ederatioa  to  recognize  only  those  who  are  regular  users  of  public  recreation 
:rounds.  New  York's  team  included  Louis  Oshman,  Crotona  Park  winner  and 
ity  champion,  and  Louis  Joffe,  Central  Park  winner  and  runner-up  to  Oshman. 
Dhese  men  teamed  in.  doubles  and  did  so  well  that  they  were  defeated  only  by 
}t.  Louis,  when  they  played  for  the  national  title. 

New  York  won  the  championship  of  the  Eastern  Section  at  Baltimore,  August 
.&,  by  defeating  Baltimore  and  Hartford,  the  latter  team  having  defeated  Wor- 
lester.    The  summaries : 

NEW  YORK  VS.  BALTIMORE — Hobelman  (Baltimore)  d.  Louis  Oshman  (New  York). 
1/3,6/3;  Louis  Joffe  (New  York)  d.  Hihn  (Baltimore),  7/5,6/0;  Oshman  and  JofCe  (New 
fork)   d.  Hobelman  and  Hihn  (Baltimore),  6/3,6/4. 

HARTFORD  VS.  WORCESTER— L.  H.  Wiley  (Hartford)  d.  R.  G.  Kendall  (Worcester), 
.0/8,6/4;   It.  R.  King   (Hartford)   d.  L.  H.  Gray   (Worcester),  6/2,6/0. 
The  final  round  was  played  in  the  afternoon,  and  resulted  as  follows : 

NEW  YORK  vs.  HARTFORD— Oshman  (New  York)  d.  Wiley  (Hartford),  6/1,3/6,6/2; 
loffo  (New  York)  d.  F.  E.  Bel  (Hartford),  6/2,6/1;  Oshman  and  Joffe  (New  York)  d. 
Wiley  and  King  (Hartford),  7/5,6/2. 

In  the  Central  Section  there  were  misunderstandings  which  resulted  in  a 
Jefault  by  Chicago  to  Cincinnati,  after  each  city  had  chosen  its  team  and 
irrangements  had  been  made  for  the  match.  ^Minneapolis  won  Ihe  Western  Sec- 
tional honors,  defeating  Springfield,   111.,  as  follows  : 

MINNEAPOLIS  VS.  SPRINGFIKLD,  ILL.— William  Widen  (Minneapolis)  d.  Joseph  Cat- 
in  (Springlii'Ui),  0/2.6,4;  Frank  Douglas  (Minneapolis)  d.  H.  M.  Edwards  (Springfield), 
r/5,3/6,6/2;  Widen  and  Legerfiel  (Minneapolis)  d.  R.  Catlin  and  Edwards  (Springfield), 
1/1.4/6,6/4,4/6,6/4. 

Then  onme  the  intersectional  matches ;  New  York  won  in  Cincimiati.  Septem- 
ber 19,  taking  l>oth  singles  and  doubles.  Krusling  and  Janowitz  had  played  in 
the  Tri-State  tournament,  losing  to  "Trux"  Emerson  and  B.  A.  Holden  after  a 
good  match,  so  thev  were  expected  to  win  their  event,  but  Oshman  and  Joffe 
went  through  them 'rather  easily.     The  scores: 


(1)  T.  E.  MuKsellman,  'Winnpr  IlliiioN-Jlissdnri-Iowa  Toiininmfnt  iji  H  L.  Beyer,

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  181 

NEW  YORK  VS.  CINCINNATI— Oshman  (New  York)  d.  Roy  McDlarmld  (Cincinnati), 
6/2,6/1;  Joffe  (New  York)  d.  Hunt  Albert  (Cincinnati),  6/3,6/4,6/4;  Oshman  and  Joffe  (New 
York)   d.  Krusling  and  Janowitz   (Cincinnati),  7/5,6/4,6/3. 

Minneapolis  was  scheduled  to  play  in  St.  Louis  September  21,  bwt  was  unable 
to  make  the  trip  for  financial  reasons.  So  New  York  played  St.  Louis  for  the 
national  title  and  lost.  The  decisive  victory  of  the  »Vesterners  is,  in  nart  at 
least,  an  indication  of  the  superior  provision  St.  Louis  makes  for  its  tennis 
players.  Class  told  emphatically,  and  there  was  no  doubt  as  to  the  significance 
of  the  following  scores : 

ST.  LOUIS  VS.  NEW  YORK— Taylor  Ward  (St.  Louis)  d.  Joffe  (New  York),  2/6,6/8,6/4, 
6/4,6/3;  Ted  Drewes  (St.  Louis)  d.  Oshman  (New  York),  6/2,6/1,6/4;  Fred  Josties  and 
Drewes  (St.  Louis)  d.  Oshman  and  Joffe  (New  York),  6/2,6/4,3/6,6/4. 

The  tournament  was  conducted  in  splendid  fashion.  Nelson  Cunliff,  Commis- 
sioner of  Recreation,  and  Rodowe  Abeken,  Superintendent  of  Recreation  in  St. 
Louis,  together  with  Dwight  F.  Davis,  had  attended  to  every  preliminary  detail. 
Paul  B.  Williams,  field  secretary  of  the  U.S.N. L.T..\.,  was  with  the  New  York 
team  on  the  trip,  thus  showing  the  National  Association's  interest  in  the 
movement. 

Very  significant  was  the  attitude  of  the  gallery.  The  matches  were  played  in 
the  beautiful  park  occupying  the  grounds  of  the  exposition  of  1904,  consequently 
admission  was  free.  Some  of  the  portable  bleachers  St.  T^uis  provides  for 
municipal  events  had  been  erected  and  these  were  filled.  The  spectators  dis- 
played fine  sportsmanship,  applauded  the  visitors  generously  and  in  every  way 
demonstrated  their  understanding  of  tennis  etiquette.  Public  interest  in  the 
matches  was  demonstrated  by  headlines  that  spread  clear  across  the  top  of  the 
St.  Louia  newspapers. 


Lawn  Tennis  in  Minneapolis 


John  W.  Adams,  Jr.,  gained  the  local  city  net  title  when  he  defeated  his  old 
rival,  Seiforde  Stellwagea,  in  the  finals  at  the  Minneapolis  Tennis  Club.  The 
entry  in  this  meet  was  by  far  the  biggest  in  many  seasons,  and  Stellwagen 
caught  Adams  at  the  height  of  his  game.  The  match  was  close  all  the  way 
through,  five  sets  being  necessary  before  the  former  State  champion  was 
declared  the  winner.  His  speedy  serve  and  fast  lawfords  were  prominent 
factors   in    sending    Stellwagen   down    to    defeat. 

Minneapolis  Park  Tennis. — Wilford  Widen  again  succeeded  in  winning  the 
Park  tennis  title  in  which  a  heavy  entry  was  recorded.  He  defeated  Frank 
Douglas  in  the  finals  in  three  straight  sets.  Widen,  with  his  partner,  Logefiel, 
also  carried  ofiE  the  Park  doubles  title.  More  than  125  players  were  entered  in 
this  annual  tournament  and  close  matches  marked  the  play.  Widen  and 
Logefiel  also  successfully  defended  their  title  against  invaders  from  Springfield, 
111.,  the  local  pair  winning  every  doubles  and  singles  matches  played. 

South  Carolina  Intercollegiate  Tennis  Association  Championships.— The  South  Carolina 
Intercollegiate  Tennis  Association  held  its  annual  tournament  at  Greenville,  October  17, 
1916.  Throufrh  the  kindness  of  the  Sans  Souci  Country  Club,  the  association  was  allowed 
to  use  the  splendid  I'lay  courts  of  the  club.  Six  institutions  were  represented,  namely: 
University  of  Sotitli  Carolina,  Clemson  Agricultural  College,  Wofford  College,  Erskine  Col-

Writing  a  story  of  Kansas  City's  tennis  season  for  the  year  1916,  one  might 
use  only  superlatives  and  not  exaggerate.  The  words  "greatest"  and  "best"  could 
be  iflscrted  in  evory  line  and  the  season  would  not  be  over-described.  It  was 
some  considerable  season. 

The  spring  of  191G  saw  the  opening  of  two  new  tennis  clubs  in  Kansas  City, 
one  an  exclusive  tennis  organization  known  as  the  Rockhill  Club,  the  other 
a  club  featuring  tennis  and  amateur  baseball.  This  club  is  called  the  Kansas 
City  Field  Club. 

The  rapid  organization  of  these  two  clubs  proved  a  stimulus  to  tennis  in 
Kansas  City  and  the  game  was  more  popular  with  players  and  spectators  than 
ever   before. 

Naturally  there  was  a  great  rivalry  among  the  various  clubs  which  vied  with 
one  another  in  the  way  of  putting  on  tournainent«.  The  Rockhill  Club  staged 
a  marvel  of  a  tourney  in  its  Great  Plains  singles  and  doubles  championships, 
the  Field  Club's  Missouri  State  tournament  was  a  well-managed  tourney  with 
fine  entries,  and  the  annual  Missouri  Valley  classic  held  under  the  auspices  of 
the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  was  one  of  the  best  in  the  tennis  annals  of  the 
K.C.A.C. 

The  Rockhill  Club  was  organized  by  a  group  of  tennis  enthusiasts  who  long 
had    realized    the   need    of   a    club    devoting   its    energies    exclusively    to    tennis. 
Ground   was  secured   in  the  Rockhill   district,    Kansas   City's   most   popular  and  . 
exclusive  residence  section,  a  district  laid  out  and  beautified  by  the  late  Williain  \ 
R.    Nelson.    Kansas   City's   greatest   benefactor.      The   club    is    located   at    Fort: 
eighth   Street,   between  Oak  and  Locust,   easily  accessible  and   bids  fair  to  tak^ 
its  place  among  the  finest  tennis  clubs  of  the  Middle  West.     Fourteen  courts  were 
in  use  during  the  191G   season,  and  six  new  courts  will  be  ready   for  the  1917 
season. 

The  Field  Club,  blossoming  into  clubhood  with  the  spring  of  1916,  at  once 
took  its  place  among  the  other  clubs  of  the  city  and  more  than  played  its  part 
in  the  wonder  season  that  followed.  While  not  an  exclusive  tennis  club,  the 
Field  Club  features  the  sport  on  a  par  with  amateur  base  ball  and  numbers 
among  its  members  some  of  the  best  players  in  Kansas  City,  including  the  State 
champion,  Jack  Cannon,  the  best  player  Kansas  City  ever  has  turned  out. 

The  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  featured  its  annual  Missouri  Valley  singles 
and  doubles  play  as  usual.  This  tournament  has  become  a  classic  in  the  valley, 
and  with  the  Great  Plains  of  the  Rockhill  Club  and  the  Missouri  State  of  the 
Field  Club,  served  to  give  Kansas  City  a  tournament  season  that  will  stand 
as  a  standard   for   many   seasons. 

By  way  of  further  illustrating  the  vast  interest  in  the  game,  must  be  men- 
tioned the  organization  of  a  Public  I'laygrounds  Association  and  the  playing  of 
a  gigantic  city  tournament  in  which  Howard  Penfold,  listed  ninth  in  the  city 
rankimr,  emerged  the  singles  champion.  The  rankings  preceding  this  story  were 
made  by  a  tennis  expert  who  has  followed  the  game  in  Kansas  City  for  years 
and  is  "thoroughly  familiar  with  the  play  of  the  ranking  ten,  both  men  and 
women. 

Kansas  Citv  has  more  than  one  hundred  public  courts,  located  on  city  park 
iand  and  maintained  by  the  park  board.  These  courts  are  busy  from  early 
morning  until  darkness  drives  the  players  home.

The  Great  Plains  championships,  singles  and  doubles,  for  women,  June  2«- 
Tuly  1,  drew  seventy-four  playing  entries,  while  the  Groat  Plains  singles  and 
louhles  for  men,  July  15-22,  had  an  entry  list  of  130  players. 

The  vvomens  tournament  brought  to  Kansas  City  players  from  the  Missouri 
7all«'y,  the  Middle  West  and  the  youth. 

The  scope  of  country  covered  by  the  entries  perhaps  may  be  attested  by  the 
ilaycrs  who  met  in  the  finals.  Miss  Irving  Murphy  of  New  Orleans,  Southern 
ihanipion,  defeated  Miss  Marguerite  Davis  of  St.  Paul  in  the  final  match.  By 
vay  of  adding  glory  to  Miss  Murphy's  victory,  it  might  be  added  that  Miss  Davis 
ater  In  the  summer  won  the  Northwestern,  the  Western,  the  Minnesota  and 
:he  Ohio  State  championships  and  was  runner-up  in  the  Tri-State  tournament 
it  Cincinnati. 

Miss  Marjorie  Hires  and  Miss  Evelyn  Seavey,  a  Kansas  City  team,  won  the 
treat  Plains  doubles  title  in  a  final  match  with  Miss  Murphy  and  Mrs.  R.  S. 
:'eer,  the  latter  a  Kansas  City  player.  Miss  Alice  Prendergast  and  Miss  Lesley 
..eHeaume,   St.   Louis  doubles  champions,    played   in  the   tournament. 

The  Great  Plains  men's  tourney,  singles,  was  won  by  Heath  Byford,  Chicago's 
ligh-ranking  player  of  the  191G  season.  A  member  of  the  Rockhill  Club.  Clifford 
r.  Lockhorn,  formerly  of  Cincinnati,  went  to  the  finals,  but  fell  before  the 
ilashlng  attack  of  the  Chicagoan.  Byford  and  Lockhorn  captured  the  doubles 
n  a  final  match  with  Jerry  and  James  Weber  of  Chicago. 

Perhaps  the  class  of  the  tournament  may  be  shown  best  in  the  naming  of 
tome  of  the  entries  :  Seiforde  Stellwagen,  Minneapolis  ;  Evan  Rees,  Dallas.  Texas  ; 
Charles  Trask  and  John  Hennessey  of  Indianapolis;  John  C.  Neely.  Chicago; 
Charles  Speice,  Kingfisher,  Oklahoma,  and  Eugene  Monett,  Norman,  Oklahoma. 

The  Great  Plains  mixed  doubles  also  was  an  interesting  Rockhill  tournament. 
diss  Marjorie  Hires  and  Heath  Moore  defeated  Miss  Evelyn  Seavey  and  C.  J. 
liOckhorn  in  the  finals.  The  Rockhill  club  also  held  the  usual  club  handicap 
:ournaments,  each  one  of  which  was  a  fine  success  in  point  of  view  of  number 
)f  entries  and  the  class  of  play. 

The  Kansas  City  Field  Club  in  the  first  year  of  its  organization  stepped  to 
he  fore  with  a  tournament  that  no  doubt  is  destined  to  live  long  in  the  annals 
)f  Missouri  tennis.  This  tournament  was  designated  the  Missouri  State  champion- 
ihip  tournament,  the  date  being  July  29-August  5. 

The  tournament  brought  out  a  remarkably  fine  list  of  entries,  among  them 
)eing  Al  liindauer  of  Chicago,  (ieorge  McMillian  of  Springfield.  Mo.,  Gregory 
md  Rice  of  St.  Louis,  and  Eugene  Monnett  of  Norman,  Oklahoma. 

Jack  Cannon,  the  Feld  Club  star,  premier  tennis  player  of  the  Missouri  Valley, 
Ton  the  singles  championship,  defeating  his  fellow  club  member,  Gordon  Parker, 
n  the  finals.  Parker  has  been  in  the  game  many  years  and  his  wonderful 
ihowing  in  the  State  tourney  was  one  of  the  spectacular  surprises  of  the    play. 

Cannon  also  played  a  part  in  the  doubles  finals.  Paired  with  Lindauer,  the 
llhlcagoan,  the  Feld  Club  man  defeated  Teachenor  and  Newell,  K.C.A.C.  entry, 
D  tile  final  match  for  the  douliles  title. 

The  Central  State  tournament  for  women  was  held  on  the  Field  Club  courts, 
rhls  tourney  was  borrowed  from  the  Ivanhoe  Club  and  it  may  become  a  perma- 
lent  I'ield  Club  institution  and  be  held  simultaneously  with  the  State  tourna- 
nent  for  men. 

Miss  Marjorie  Hires.  Kansas  City,  defeated  Mrs.  W.  W.  Yager,  also  Kansas 
?lty,  in  the  singles  finals.  In  the  doubles  Miss  Louise  Hammann  and  Miss  Mary 
Horley  defeated  Miss  Marjorie  Hires  and  Miss  Evelyn  Seavey.  All  were  Kansas 
?ity  players.     The  usual  club  handicap  tournaments  were  held. 

The  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  apparently  was  content  to  let  the  more  ex- 
:ln?ive  tennis  clubs  hatdle  the  tournament  play  of  the  season,  the  Blue  Diamond 
nenihers  devoting  themselves  to  club  play  and  the  excellent  handling  of  the 
Qub's    annual    Missouri    Valley    singles    and    doubles    championship. 

The  Missouri  Valley  tournament  has  been  a  tennis  masterpiece  for  years,  but 
:he  lOK'i  tournament  "surpassed  all  others  in  attendance  and  the  class  and  sports- 
nanship   of   the   play. 

Ralph  Burdick  and  Walter  Hayes,  the  Chicago  stars,  played  a  prominent  part 
n  making  the  valley  tourney  a  success.  Burdick  was  the  victor  in  the  singles, 
lefeating  Jack  Caniiou.  the  Feld  Club  star,  in  thi»  final  match.  The  Chicagoans 
von  the  doubles  finals,  turning  back  Teachenor  and  Newell,  the  K.C..V.C.  entry. 

Out-of-town  entries  served  to  make  this  tournament  of  unusual  interest. 
Vmong  the  visitors  were  Ralph  Powell.  Omaha  ;  Lawrence  Green,  Omaha ; 
rowner  Phelan.  St.  Louis:  Charles  Speice.  Kingfisher,  Oklahoma;  Eugene 
Honnett,  Norman,  Oklahoma  :  D.  B.  Stutsman,  Shreveport,  La. ;  Clarence  Peacock,

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  189 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Milwaukee 

By  C.   R.  Rounds. 

Three  features  stood  out  above  all  others  last  season  :  the  improvement  in  the 
quality  of  tennis  played ;  the  maintenance  of  its  remarkable  record  by  the 
Washington  Park  Club,  and  the  entrance  of  the  Town  Club  into  the  Milwaukee 
Tennis   Association. 

In  the  opinion  of  Reginald  N.  Hamilton,  who  for  five  years  was  champion 
of  Milwaukee,  but  who  was  absent  from  the  city  during  the  summer,  returning 
in  time  to  play  a  few  games  in  the  fall,  the  amount  of  improvement  for  the 
summer  should  be  placed  at  between  fifteen  and  thirty.  The  most  important 
cause  of  this  improvement  is  unquestionably  the  regular  competition  afforded 
by  the  Milwaukee  Tennis  Association.  The  nine  clubs  making  up  this  league 
play  out  a  schedule  involving  eight  matches  each,  and  all  team  members  get 
the  advantage  of  tournament  competition.  Nowhere  was  the  improvement  more 
marked  or  more  noticeable  than  in  the  open  State  tournament,  when  Alfred 
Weller  of  Milwaukee  nearly  defeated  Heath  Byford  of  Milwaukee  in  the  finals, 
as  elsewhere  related. 

The  second  feature,  the  winning  of  the  Association  pennant  by  the  Washing- 
ton I'ark  lads  for  the  third  successive  time,  without  suffering  a  single  defeat, 
is  a  record  that  will  bo  likely  to  stand  for  some  time.  This  remarkable  team 
is  a  shining  example  of  what  hard  work  plus  intelligence  plus  competition  will 
accomplish,  t'our  years  ago  these  young  men  were  typical  "sand  lot"  players. 
They  had  good  athletic  instincts,  but  they  knew  nothing  about  the  right  way 
to  play  tennis.  They  made  all  the  dub  mistakes  in  the  calendar,  their  team- 
work was  nil.  and  they  were  made  to  look  foolish  every  time  they  went  up 
against  players  who  had  had  either  good  experience  or  good  teaching,  coupled 
with  even  mediocre  tennis  ability.  But  last  year,  the  third  in  the  life  of  the  local 
association,  their  play  improved  to  such  a  marked  degree  that  even  the  Town 
Club  fell  before  them.     And  this  brings  us  to  the  third  point. 

The  Town  Club  is  the  oldest  and  most  prominent  tennis  organization  in  Wis- 
consin. Its  courts  and  club  house  are  near  the  center  of  the  city,  and  all  its 
appointments  are  first  rate.  It  has  developed  nearly  all  the  good  players — up 
to  last  year — that  Wisconsin  has  produced.  For  ten  years  previous  "to  1916 
its  teams  had  never  tasted  anything  like  defeat  at  the  hands  of  a  Milwaukee 
team.  In  fact,  when  the  -Association  was  organized  three  years  ago.  the  Town 
Club  stayed  out,  because  it  did  not  feel  that  it  had  enough  to  gain  by  entering 
the  Association.  Last  year,  however,  feeling  the  desirability  of  regular  compe- 
tition, they  applied  for"  admission  and  were  received.  At  once  speculation  be- 
came rife  as  to  whether  they  or  the  "Parks."  who  had  always  won,  and  who 
had  been  defeated  but  once  in  interclub  play  in  the  Association,  would  win. 

They  met  June  17  on  the  Park  courts,  and  the  Town  Club  boys  started  out 
to  make  an  old-fashioned  runaway  of  the  match  by  taking  the  first  three  singles 
contests.  Then  .■Mfred  Weller,  generally  picked  as  Number  One  in  Milwaukee, 
fell  before  I.ouis  Rechcygl  of  the  Parks.  This  started  the  rout.  The  superior 
teamwork  of  the  Parks  in  the  three  doubles  matches  proved  too  much  for  the 
men  of  the  older  organization,  and  all  three  doubles  contests  went  to  Wash- 
ington Park,  thus  giving  them  the  match  at  four  to  three.  They  went  through 
the  remainder  of  the  season  without  difficulty,  except  in  their  contest  with 
Kilhourn.  which  they  won  after  a  close  struggle  at  five  to  two,  thus  establishing 
the  envialile  record  of  three  years  of  interclub  play  with  but  one  defeat,  that  at 
the  hands  of  the  ICast  Side  in  1915.  All  the  clubs  in  the  Association  give  them 
ungrudging  credit,  but  .iust  the  same  they  are  out  to  see  that  Washington  Park 
doesn't    repeat.      Enough    is   a    plenty,    they    figure. 

As  for  the  standing  of  the  other  clubs,  it  will  be  seen  that  Town  Club  is  tied 
witli  West  Side  for  second  place,  the  former  having  defaulted  one  match.  West 
Side  is  lik*>ly  to  be  stronger  tliis  year,  as  they  have  a  host  of  new  players,  and 
a  wealth  of  playing  space,  together  with  such  conveniences  as  will  attract  their 
players  to  the  courts.  Kilhourn  came  to  the  front  with  five  straight  victories, 
largely  through  the  high-grade  work  of  their  captain.  Herbert  Efflandt. 

When  it  conies  to  the  ticklish  task  of  ranking  the  first  ten  men  in  Milwaukee, 
one  hesitates,  but.  judging  by  191fi  play  solely,  and  limiting  the  play  thus 
considered  to  official  competition,  six  names  readily  suggest  themselves :  Bert 
Thclen,  Louis  Rechcygl  and  Elmer  Llpman  of  Washington  Park  ;  Alfred  Weller

week  later,  defeating  their  clubmates,  Rechc.vgl  and  Stuckert,  on  the  Oshkosh 
courts.  Just  to  show  how  closely  the  players  are  bunched — Rechcygl,  who  had 
been  put  out  by  his  team  mate,  Stuckert,  in  the  State  eliminations,  turned 
around  and  defeated  Thelen  for  the  Park  Club  championship, 

Alfred  Weller  will  generally  be  accorded  first  place  in  the  ranking.  Notwith- 
Btanding  his  late  start,  he  was  showing  the  best  tennis  at  the  close  of  the 
season  that  had  been  seen  on  the  courts  last  year,  and  there  is  little  doubt  that 
no  other  local  player  could  have  given  Byford  so  hard  a  fight.  "Abbie"  has 
been  well  taught;  his  game  is  thoughtful  and  resourceful;  he  is  a  marvel  at 
defense ;  his  wide  and  high-class  experience  help  him  immeasurably  in  tourna- 
ment play.     The  writer's  line-up  follows : 

1 — Alfred  Weller,  Town  Club.  6 — Herbert  Efflandt,  Kilboum. 

2 — Bert  Thelen,  Washington  Park.  7 — Walter  Stuckert.  Washington  Park. 

3 — Glenway  Maxon,  Jr.,  Town  Club.  8 — Dr.  Goldstern,  West  Side. 

4 — Louis  Rechc.vgl,  Washington  Park.  9 — Lester  Seefeld,  West  Side. 

5 — Elmer  Lipman,  Washington  Park.  10 — Harry  Effler,  West  Side. 

The  following  six  men  also  qualified  for  the  elimination  tournament :  Benson 
of  West  Side  ;  Graebner,  Loew,  and  Puis  of  National ;  Higgs  of  Kilbourn  ;  Van 
Ells  of  Bay  View,  and  Hill  of  Bast  Side.  Sheppard  and  Gibbs  of  Town  Club 
and  Wahl  of  East  Side  would  no  doubt  have  qualified  had  they  played  in  a 
suflicient  number  of  matches.  The  following  eight  doubles  teams  qualified  for 
the  eliminations:  Lipman  and  Thelen.  Washington  Park  (closed  State  cham- 
pions), and  Rechcygl  and  Stuckert,  Washington  Park;  Benson  and  Seefeld, 
West  Side ;  Crawford  and  Pollock  and  Effler  and  Kirchner,  West  Side ;  Loew 
and  Puis,  National ;  Higgs  and  Waite,  Kilbourn ;  Hunter  and  Seeger,  Cutler- 
Hammer. 

The  clubs  finished  in  the  following  order :  Washington  Park  ;  West  Side  and 
Town  Club  tied  for  second  •  National,  Kilbourn,  East  Side,  Bay  View,  Cutler- 
Hammer,   Midway. 

Northern  Indiana  Championships. — Practically  all  the  best  Indianapolis  players  were 
represented  in  the  tournament,  which  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Fort  Wayne  Country 
Club,  July  31  to  August  5,  1916,  together  with  Baker  and  McNagney  from  Columbia  City. 
Kiefer  and  LeBloud  from  Cincinnati  and  Ketchum  from  Chicago.  The  knowing  ones  picked 
Ketchum,  Trask,  Hoag  and  Kiefer  as  the  real  contenders.  The  big  surprise  came  when 
young  John  Hennessey  defeated  Iloag;  McKay  lost  to  Kiefer,  Trask  was  beaten  in  the 
semi-finals  by  Ketchum  and  Kiefer  put  Hennessey  away  in  this  round  after  the  youngster 
had  taken  the  first  set.  The  finals  brought  Ketchum  and  Kiefer  together,  which  Ketchum 
annexed,  6/4,7/5,5/7,6/2.  The  doubles  event  was  won  by  McKay  and  Thomas,  who 
defeated  Hoag  and  Ketchum,  largely  because  of  their  superior  overhead  smashing.  Miss 
Katherine  Brown  of  Indianapolis  demonstrated  her  class  in  the  ladies'  singles,  by  defeating 
all  comers.  Summaries:  Men's  Singles — First  round — M.  MulhoUand  d.  H.  Gilbert,  6/2.

I  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  191 

Lawa  Tennis  in  Oklahoma 

By  Charles  T.  Speice. 

Tennis  in  Ol^lahoma  for  the  year  of  1916  was  featured  with  the  advanced  game 
of  the  younger  element.  Many  new  faces  were  seen  at  the  various  tournaments, 
antl  although  they  did  not  share  in  any  of  the  final  winnings,  yet  they  exhibited 
a  coolness,  a  determination  and  a  varied  assortment  of  strokes,  all  of  which 
combined  to  make  the  old.  experienced  players  go  the  limit.  Circumstances  arose 
in  such  a  manner  that  the  Okfahomans  were  not  favored  with  the  presence  of 
their  Kansas  City  and  other  out-of-State  players,  but  the  expectation  of  same 
during  1917  is  eagerly  awaited. 

The  State  championship  was  won  by  Paul  Darrough  of  Hugo,  the  1916  title- 
holder,  in  a  five-set  match  from  Charles  T.  Speice  of  Kingfisher,  5/7,4/6,6/i0,6/.3, 
7/5.  The  tournament  was  held  at  the  Oklahoma  Golf  and  Country  Club,  Okla- 
homa City. 

Many  new  courts  were  built  during  the  season  throughout  the  State,  among 
which  were  quite  a  number  of  concrete  courts.  The  Oklahoma  Golf  and  Country 
Club  has  four  such  courts. 

Some  of  the  older  players  made  tennis  campaigns  out  of  the  Stat©  and  in  most 
events  met  with  fair  success.  Probably  the  most  noteworthy  was  that  attained 
by  the  Oklahoma  University  star,  E.  O.  Monnett,  who  defeated  Jerry  Weber  of 
Chicago  during  the  Rockhill  tournament  at  Kansas  City.  Monnett  has  a  younger 
brother  who  shows  much  promise  :  in  fact,  during  the  State  tournament  he  only 
lost  to  Darrough  after  a  close  match. 

The  doubles  play  developed  many  new  teams  and  the  brand  of  play  manifested 
foreshadows  some  "exciting  struggles  during  1917. 
The  ranking  for  1916  is  as  follows : 

SINGLES. 
1— Paul  Darrough,  Hugo  6— E.  B.  Laing,  Kingfisher

That  lawn  tennis  is  jrrowing  in  popularity  amonsr  the  Filipinos  was  shown 
in  the  attendance  and  interest  manifested  in  the  lournament  for  the  champion- 
Bhip  of  the  Orient,  held  at  Manila,  Philippine  Islands.  January  1  to  8.  Further- 
more, according  to  E.  S.  Gee,  the  "Blather  of  Lawn  Tennis  in  the  Philippines," 
there  are  now  twenty-flve  thousand  players  throughout  the  islands — all  Amer- 
icana and  Europeans — which  is  quite  a  growth  from  1906,  when  there  were  only 
three  or  four  hundred.  It  Is  further  hoped  that  a  high  class  team  will  be  sent 
to  the  United  States  before  long. 

The  1917  championship  was  rendered  doubly  attractive  by  the  appearance  of 
the  two  distinguished  American  players — George  Meyers  Church  and  Harold  A. 
Throckmorton.  While  they  garnered  all  the  honors,  the  natives  made  it  very 
Interesting  before  they  were  subdued.  In  the  singles.  "Poppa"  Gee  made  Throck- 
niortdu  go  four  sets  before  the  visitor  won.  0/4. (3/4, .5/7. 6/0,  and  Gil  Fargas 
pushed  Church  before  the  latter  won  at  7/5,6/4,6/1.  The  final  round  between 
Church  and  Throckmorton  was  hard  fought,  Church  winning.  5/7.7/.5.6/4,6/4. 

By  capturing  three  out  of  five  sets  in  the  closest  and  most  spectacular  match 
In  the  doubles  tournament.  Church  and  Throckmorton  won  the  championship, 
defeating  Gil  Fargas  and  Leonardo  Suarez.  5/7.6/3.5/7.6/4,6/1.  The  local  men 
were  in  the  best  of  form  and  they  were  never  before  seen  to  play  the  class  of 
tennis  which  they  displayed.  The  showing  of  Snarez  was  regarded  as  the  real 
feature  of  the  match.  Church  was  also  there  in  the  hardest  stages  of  the  match 
ami  his  plnck  and  heady  work  were  mainly  responsible  for  their  hard  earned 
victory.  Throckmorton's  work  was  a  surprise  to  the  many  people  who  had 
seen  him  play  in  former  matches.  ITe  did  not  show  the  "pep"  and  accuracy 
as  on  former  occasions,  his  erratic  .iudgment  In  killing  and  volleying  putting  him

Lawn  Tennis  in  the  Argentine 

That  lawn  tennis  has  become  very  popular  in  the  .\rgentin':>,  the  prosperous 
Bouth  .American  Republic.  Is  shown  by  interesting  articles  written  by  Harry  F. 
Prescott,  president  of  the  Argentine  Lawn  Tennis  League,  for  American  Lawn 
Tennis.  The  features  of  Mr.  Prescott's  articles  that  appeal  to  devotees  of  the 
game  in  this  country  are  these : 

"The  first  thing  a  stranger  notices  in  commencing  to  play  tenn4s  In  the 
Argentine,  or  any  country  south  of  the  equator,  is  the  peculiar  atmospheric 
conditions.  I  have  never  been  able  to  find  out  exactly  what  the  condition  Is, 
but  I  imagine  it  Is  the  unusual  clearness  which  makes  the  court  appear  shorter 
and  the  ball  coming  toward  you  appear  much  nearer  than  it  actually  is. 

"One  other  thing  that  is  a  pleasant  change  from  the  courts  In  this  country 
Is  that  the  ma.iority  of  the  courts  in  the  .Vrgentine  are  made  of  brick  dust,  andi 
when  I  say  brick  dust  I  mean  the  dust  obtained  from  crushing  the  best  grade 
of  baked  red  brick,  not  second  grade  brick  or  burned  brick,  but  the  best 
grade  obtainable.  A  court  of  this  material  properly  laid  down  gives  most 
excell<-nt  results,  as  the  color  is  most  pleasing  to  tho  eye.  the  balls  do  not  readily 
<ake  on  the  reddish  color  and  the  surface  dries  with  great  rapidity  after  the 
most  violent  rain.  .\  court  of  this  material  costs  about  500  pesos  i.'?210i  U.  S. 
gold  1 . 

"On  account  of  the  extreme  heat  during  the  summer  months,  and  the  soil  not 
particularly  well  adapted  to  growing  lawns,  there  are  practically  no  grass  courts 
In  the  South  American  countries.  The  exception  to  this  rule  Is  the  Hurlingham 
Club  In  Buenos  Aires,  which  has  five  grass  courts,  but  the  season  during  which 


194  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

they  can  be  used  Is  extremely  short,  and  at  their  best  are  not  more  than  secoi 
grade  courts. 

"One  peculiarity  of  tennis  in  the  Argentine,  which  will  strilfe  a  foreigner,  ]i 
the  fact  that  handicapped  tennis  is  the  rule  there  in  most  of  the  tournaments—- 
scratch  events  are  few  and  far  between.  Nearly  every  week-end  there  is  heK 
at  the  various  clubs  so-called  'American  Tournaments,'  with  a  sealed  handicap 
that  Is,  the  handicap  Is  not  disclosed  until  the  play  Is  finished.  In  this  event 
•which  is  really  a  'Round  Robin.'  every  one  plays  every  one  else  three  gamei 
each  side  of  the  net  and  the  number  of  games  won  are  recorded,  the  handlcaj 
being  added  to  this  score  after  the  play  has  finished. 

"Up  to  within  the  last  few  years  there  has  never  been  a  tennis  league  or  asso 
elation   of   a   serious  nature,   but  at   the   present   time  we  have  an   organizatiolT 
which  is  filling  a  long  felt  want  in  drawing  the  clubs  together  and  putting  tlfl 
game  of  lawn  tennis  on  a  firmer  footing.  3 

"The  two  finest  courts  in  the  Argentine  are  at  the  Belgrano  Athletic  Club  U 
Buenos  Aires,  which  have  a  nine-foot  green  fence  completely  surrounding  themj 
with  the  exception  of  perhaps  thirty  feet  at  the  side  which  is  taken  up  by  grand- 
stands. The  combination  of  dark  green  background,  dark  red  courts  and  white 
tennis  balls  is  ideal,  and  I  doubt  If  better  tennis  conditions  are  to  be  found 
on  any  hard  courts  in  the  United  States. 

"The  championships  of  the  Argentine,  which  carry  the  title  of  champion  of  the 
River  Plate,  are  held  in  May  of  each  year  under  the  auspices  of  the  Buenos 
Aires  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  the  rules  of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  England 
governing  the  tournament.  Whereas  this  meeting  is  open  to  all  amateurs  there 
is  one  restriction,  namely,  that  a  person  must  be  a  resident  at  least  five  months 
in  the  Argentine  before  becoming  eligible  to  enter.  'The  trophies  for  these  events 
are  massive  silver  cups  costing  on  an  average  of  not  less  than  $500  each,  but 
can  never  be  won  outright — a  replica  or  gold  medal  is  given  to  the  winner. 

"When  one  thinks  of  lawn  tennis  in  the  Argentine  or  the  history  of  the  cham-i 
pionships  there  one  immediately  thinks  of  the  Knight  family  of  that  country] 
who  have  been  so  prominent  during  the  last  twenty  years  in  all  the  touma-i 
ments,  exhibitions  and  interclub  matches.  There  are  four  brothers,  A.  H.J 
E.  Stanley,  H.  B.  M,  and  Lionel  H.  Knight.  To  the  father,  A.  A.  Knight,  do 
the  sons  owe  a  large  part  of  their  wonderful  success,  for  when  they  were  i 
youngsters  he  used  to  put  the  four  of  them  on  their  private  court  and  from 
hlg  position  in  the  umpire's  chair  would  direct  their  play. 

"The  Knight  boys  have  competed  in  the  championship  of  the  River  Plate  (the 
national  championship  of  the  Argentine)  every  year  since  1900  with  the  excep- 
tion of  190©  and  1912  and  have  won  the  championship  every  year  since  1900 
without  exception.     This  in  itself  is  a  remarkable  performance. 

"At  the  present  time  the  crown  rests  on  the  head  of  Lionel  H.  Knight,  and 
at  the  pace  he  was  playing  a  few  months  ago  I  see  no  reason  why  it  should  be 
displaced  for  some  years  to  come  if  he  continues  to  play.  His  game  is  remark- 
able in  a  number  of  ways.  In  the  first  place  he  is  a  natural  born  tennis  player 
who  has  never  had  the  opportunity  of  playing  with  any  one  better  than  himself 
nor  the  privilege  of  instruction  from  a  professional,  yet  he  does  nothing  wrong 
on  the  court.  Perhaps  the  strongest  part  of  his  game  is  the  infinite  variety  he 
puts  into  it.  His  service  Is  wihout  break,  but  he  varies  the  pace  and  places  it 
so  well  that  he  keeps  one  uneasy  and  guessing  every  minute.  He  Is  steadiness 
personified   and   disguises  his   strokes    remarkably. 

"Partnered  with  his  brother.  H.  B.  M.  Knight,  they  make  an  extremely  well 
balanced  doubles  team  and  most  interesting  to  watch  in  action.  H.  B.  M.  is 
the  better  of  the  two  as  a  doubles  player,  but  Lionel  plays  better  doubles  with 
him  than  with  any  one  else. 

"Of  the  native  players  there  are  but  few  at  the  present  time  who  are  really 
good  players.  One,  Sefior  Diego  E.  Cerboni,  won  the  championship  in  1912.  none 
of  the  Knights  competing.  Cerboni  is  a  tennis  enthusiast  and  has  studied  the 
game  with  good  results.  He  is  far  the  quickest  man  at  the  net  in  that  country 
and  has  an  unusual  knowledge  of  just  where  to  place  the  ball.  A.  J.  Vlllegas, 
another  native  of  Argentina,  plays  an  excellent  game. 

"Of  the  'First  Ten'  in  the  .\rgentine  there  are  two  more  natives  of  that 
country  worthy  of  mention,  Sefior  Frederico  Elortondo  and  Sefior  Diogenes  de 
Urqulza.  The  former  has  never  played  outside  of  the  Argentine,  but  started  to 
play  some  five  years  ago  with  Sefior  D.  Cerboni.  and  together  developed  their 
game.     Elortondo  is  an  'iron  man.'  being  able  to  play  all  day. 

"Of  the  women  players  there  are  two  who  are  in  a  class  by  themselves.  Miss 
Dorothy  Boadle  heads  the  list.     She  is  the  holder  of  the  title  at  the  present  time 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  195 

and  there  is  no  one  who  can  claim  to  hope  to  have  a  chance  with  her,  with  the 
possible  exception  of  Miss  Catherine  N.  Mackenzie.  The  latter  is  the  womaa 
champion  of  that  country  in  golf,  and  on  account  of  her  devoting  the  necessary 
time  for  the  nractice  of  that  game  she  is  not  going  forward  as  fast  in  tennis 
as  she  might. 

"Miss  Boadle  has  had  the  advantage  of  considerable  tournament  play  In  Eng- 
land and  on  the  continent,  and  her  play  is  marked  by  extreme  steadiness  and 
confidence  in  her  strokes.  Miss  Mackenzie  plays  a  better  all  round  game  than 
Miss  Boadle  but  lacks  the  steadiness  and  experience  of  the  latter. 

"To  compare  the  standard  of  play  of  the  three  or  four  best  players  In  thft 
Argentine  with  the  'First  Ten'  in  the  United  States  is  most  difficult,  because  ot 
the  vast  difiference  in  the  playing  conditions  of  the  two  countries." 


Lawn  Tennis  in  Spain 

The  tournament  for  the  championships  of  Spain  and  the  city  of  Madrid,  held 
at  Madrid,  was  a  huge  success,  to  which  the  Queen  contributed  by  her  presence 
and  by  presenting  the  cups  to  the  victors  on  the  final  day.  Thirteen  players 
competed  for  the  national  title  and  fifteen  for  that  of  the  capital. 

El  Conde  de  Gomar,  a  nineteen-year-old  member  of  the  old  Spanish  nobility, 
distinguished  himself  by  winning  the  Spanish  as  well  as  the  Madrid  title.  The 
count  was  also  victorious  in  the  city  doubles,  with  M.  Alonso,  the  1915  singles 
titleholder,  as  a  partner,  and  in  the  mixed  doubles  with  Senorita  Carmen  Portago.

Western  Lawn  Tennis  Association  Junior  Championships 

The  first  .nnnual  boys'  and  juniors'  championship  tournament,  under  the  aus- 
pices of  the  Western  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  was  held  on  the  clay  courts  of 
the  Chicago  Tennis  Club,  .Tuly  10  to  14.  To  one  who  has  followed  the  game  in 
Chicago  and  vicinity,  the  brand  of  tennis  put  up  by  the  younger  tennis  players 
is.  to  say  the  least,  encouraging,  .\mong  the  junior  entries  especially  will  be 
found  the  names  of  such  players  as  .Tames  Weber,  H.  P.  Vories.  A.  C.  Nielsen,  Pat 
Segal  and  Ruthven  Pike.  These  boys  even  now  can  make  some  of  our  older 
players  extend  themselves.  After  a  few  seasons  of  tournament  experience  we 
expect  to  find  their  names  heading  the  Middle  West  tennis  players.  The  sum-

Indianapolis  Championships. — The  following  account  of  tennis  in  Indianapolis  has  been 
contril)uted  by  Mr.  Hence  A.  Orme:  .\11  of  the  best  Indianapolis  players  were  entered  for 
the  championship  of  Iiuliauapolis,  held  July  8  and  following  days,  on  the  courts  of  th» 
Hawtliorne  Tenuis  Club.  Among  the  veterans  were  Trask,  Hoa'g,  McKay,  Thomas,  Dr. 
Hadlcy,  Pierce.  Grumme,  Pray  and  Voshell,  and  of  the  younger  players,  the  Bastian 
brothers,  Hennessey,  Seidenstecker,  Ervin,  Koehler  and  Tom  Hendricks.  Gage  Hoag 
seemed  to  be  the  favorite,  while  friends  of  Trask  were  hopeful  that  he  would  win.  Jack 
McKay  was  picked  by  many  as  a  contender  because  of  his  recent  tennis  experience,  while 
a  member  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  in  New  York,  with  Fritz  Bastian,  the  Indiana 
junior  champion,  as  a  dark  horse.  Trask  upset  all  the  dope  by  beating  his  old  rival  Hoag, 
and  in  succession,  defeating  Bastian,  Hennessey  and  McKay.  His  match  with  Fritz 
Bastian  was  the  feature  match  of  the  tournament,  and  it  kept  the  spectators  on  edge 
every  minute.  It  was  anybody's  match  until  the  last  point  was  called.  In  the  doubles 
the  McKay-Thomas  and  Kipp-Hoag  teams  were  picked  as  the  strong  teams,  but  before 
the  tournament  had  progressed  very  far,  two  teams  of  youngsters  came  into  the  limelight, 
being  Kohn  and  Bob  Bastian  and  Hennessey  and  Ervin.  Thomas  and  McKay  were 
forced  to  the  limit  to  defeat  Hennessey  and  Ervin,  while  Kohn  and  Bob  Bastian  did  not 
sulTcr  defeat  until  they  reached  the  finals,  which  was  given  to  them  by  Kipp  and  Hoag. 
Indianapolis  uncovered  a  real  woman  tennis  player  in  the  person  of  Mrs.  Willis  Adamsj 
who  clearly  demonstrated  her  ability  by  defeating  such  good  players  as  Miss  Catherine 
Brown  and  Mrs.  Watt  Pugh.  Summaries:  Men's  Singles — First  round  (where  no  score  is

226  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Report  of  the  Ranking  Committee  for  1916 

To  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  AssociO' 
Operation  of  New  System. 

Acting  under  Sections  24,  25  and  26  of  the  Regulations  for  the  Management  of 
Tournament',  your  Committee  furnished  all  clubs  and  associations  holding  sanc- 
tioned events  with  blanks  for  the  purpose  of  making  returns.  By  diligent  and 
continued  efforts,  reports  were  procured  on  223  tournaments,  the  names  of  those 
delinquent  being  as  follows  :  Oklahoma  City  Golf  and  County  Club,  Oklahoma 
City,  Okla.  ;  New  Rochelle  Tennis  Club,  New  Rochelle,  N.  Y. ;  Birmingham  Country 
Club,  Birmingham,  Ala. ;  Kansas  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  Independence,  Kan. 
(Kansas  State  Championship)  ;  Western  Michigan  Lawn  Tennis  Association, 
Grand  Rapids.  Mich.  (Western  Michigan  Championship);  Inter-Mountain  Lawn 
Tennis  Association,  Salt  Lake  City,  Utah  (Inter-Mountain  Championship)  ;  Spring- 
field Country  Club.   Springfield,  Mo. 

In  arriving  at  its  conclusions,  your  committee  had  before  it  card  index  records 
of  4,506  players  in  men's  singles  and  2,111  teams  in  men's  doubles.  A  sub-com- 
mittee for  the  women's  ranking  was  furnished  with  records  of  1,032  players. 

,Your  committee  feels  satisfied  with  the  results  of  the  first  year's  trial  of  the 
new  system  recommended  by  the  preceding  Ranking  Committee.  When  it  is  con- 
sidered that  summaries  of  all  events  sanctioned  by  the  Association,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  seven,  were  received  by  the  committee,  most  of  them  being  in  completed 
form  for  its  consideration,  we  can  well  express  our  appreciation  of  the  co-opera- 
tion shown  by  tbe  oflicials  of  the  various  associations  and  clubs  in  the  work  of 

the  committee.    '  o  ,-•„  iv-        o 

Suggested  Change  in  New  System. 

We  would  respectfully  suggest,  however,  that  the  labor  and  detail  of  collecting, 
compiling  and  indexing  of  the  names,  addresses  and  matches  of  the  various 
tournament  participants  come  more  properly  under  the  jurisdiction  of  one  of  the 
oflBces  of  the  .Association,  preferably  that  of  the  Field  Secretary  ;  and  we  would 
therefore  recommend  that  all  such  duties  be  placed  under  the  control  and  guidance 
of  the  Field  Secretary,  bringing  him  into  direct  personal  touch  with  the  indi- 
vidual associations  and  clubs  and  thus  affording  the  opportunity  of  quickly  reach- 
ing those  responsible  for  delays  in  reporting  tournaments. 

This  method  will  also  reduce  the  expense  of  clerical  hire,  as  the  employees  of 
his  office  can  regularly  and  systematically  handle  this  additional  labor,  while  at 
present  it  is  necessary  for  the  Ranking  Committee  to  engage  special  assistance  for 
this  purpose.  Although  a  considerable  amount  of  the  clerical  work  was  furnished 
gratuitously,  the  expenses  of  the  committee  under  the  new  system  were  unavoid- 
ably greater  than  those  of  preceding  years  by  reason  of  the  increased  detail. 

Delays  in  reporting  tournaments  are  frequently  serious  and  the  work  of  the 
Ranking  Committee  is  hampered  thereby.  In  one  instance,  particularly,  was  this 
the  case — that  of  the  women's  singles  event,  held  on  September  5  by  the  New  York 
Lawn  'Tennis  Club,  where  the  summaries  only  reached  the  Committee  on  Novem- 
ber 28.  and  the  data  contained  therein  was  of  sufficient  importance  to  change 
the  decision  of  the  Committee  as  to  the  standing  of  two  players. 

Rules  Governing  the  Committee. 

In  its  deliberations  the  Committee  has  been  guided  by  the  rules  previously  estab- 
lished for  determining  priority  of  rank.  A  question  was  raised  as  to  our  duty 
to  consider  foreign  players  participating  in  sanctioned  events,  but  precedent 
appears  to  have  established  the  practice  of  ranking  them. 

Your  attention  is  respectfully  brought  to  the  fact  that  each  succeeding  Ranking 
Committee  must  examine  the  "reports  and  correspondence  of  a  number  of  previ- 
ous committees  in  order  to  arrive  at  an  understanding  of  the  rules  for  its  guid- 
ance, and  that  there  is  no  official  code  containing  a  clear  statement  of  such  rules. 

Code  Suggested. 

We  suggest  the  advisability  of  the  appointment  of  a  committee  to  prepare  and 
BUbmit  to  the  proper  authority  a  codification  of  rules  to  govern  the  ranking  of  < 
players.  Prominent  Players  Not  Ranked. 

A  request  was  received  from  Dr.  Sumner  Hardy,  President  of  the  Pacific  States 
Lawa  Tennis  Association,  that  no  action  be  taken  on  Pacific  Coast  players,  who 
did  not  engage  in  Eastern  events,  and  as  the  data  concerning  such  players  is  insuf- 
ficient to  make  proper  comparisons,  they  were  not  considered.     It  was  necessary 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  227 

to  omit  for  the  same  reason  of  insufficient  data  a  number  of  players  of  national 
prominence  who  undoubtedly  would  have  attained  high  rank  had  they  played  ia 

more  events.  itt  .     t%  /-, 

Women  s  Ranking  CoMMiTTirE. 

The  committee  wishes  to  thank  the  Women's  Ranking  Committee,  composed  of 
Mrs.  William  H.  Pouch,  chairman ;  Mrs.  Thomas  C.  Bundy  and  Mrs.  Benjamin  F. 
Briggs  for  its  efficient  aid. 

SUPPLEMENTAEI  REMABKS  TO  THE  BANKING. 

In  submitting  the  ranking  for  your  consideration,  the  committee  desires  to  add 
the  following  supplementary  remarks  :  No  difficulty  was  experienced  in  award- 
ing positions  one  and  two  to  R.  N.  Williams,  2nd,  and  William  M.  Johnston,  respec- 
tively. The  placing  of  Church  in  the  third  and  Murray  in  the  fourth  positions 
was  done  only  after  much  discussion  ;  but  on  the  complete  record  of  the  season. 
Church  seemed  to  be  entitled  to  a  preference,  as  indicated  by  the  appended  scores. 
His  defeats  by  Davis  and  Doyle  were  in  early  season  matches,  and  his  only  other 
defeats  were  by  Williams  and  Murray.  While  Church  lost  to  Murray  in  the 
National,  in  a  five-set  match,  he  won  from  Murray  at  Seabright  in  three  straight 
sets. 

Kumagae,  Griffin  and  Washburn  were  difficult  to  place  as  fifth,  sixth  and  seventh. 
The  consistent  record  of  Kumagae  made  him  the  final  choice  as  No.  5,  considera- 
tion being  given  to  the  fact  that  his  loss  to  Washburn  at  Point  Judith  was  during 
his  first  tournament  on  turf  courts.  His  defeats  were  at  the  hands  of  four  oppo- 
nents placed  by  the  committee  among  the  first  ten.  while  both  Griffin  and  Wash- 
burn lost  matches  to  players  of  lower  ranking.  The  deciding  factors  in  favor 
of  (Jriffin  over  Washburn  for  sixth  place  were  his  two  wins  from  Williams  and 
the  less  favorable  record  of  losses  by  Washburn.  Davis  was  a  fairly  easy  choice 
for  eighth,  while  the  defeats  of  Griffin  and  Kumagae  by  Armstrong  won  for  him 
the  ninth  place.  It  was  difficult  to  select  the  tenth  from  Mathey,  Throckmorton 
and  Behr.  the  choice  of  Mathey  leaving  but  a  narrow  margin  between  No.  10  and 
Class  1  players.  _,  _ 

Doubles  Ranking. 

The  usual  difficulty  was  experienced  in  making  a  satisfactory  ranking  in  Doubles, 
chiefly  because  of  frequent  changes  of  partners. 

Suggested  Change  in  Classification. 

The  growing  number  of  high  class  players  in  tournaments  renders  it  difficult, 
If  not  impo.'jsible.  under  the  present  method  of  division,  to  avoid  unjust  or  inac- 
curate classifications ;  to  illustrate,  there  may  be  included  in  Class  1  several 
players  who  are  virtually  the  equals  of  some  of  the  first  ten  and  superior  to 
others  in  Class  1.  Similar  conditions  may  also  arise  among  the  remaining  classes. 
Furthermore,  the  limitation  of  one  hundred  names  prevents  the  ranking  of  many 
whose  ability  entitled  them  to  consideration. 

The  committee  therefore  suggests  the  adoption  of  a  different  method  of  classifi- 
cation, and  recommends  that  future  ranking  committees  he  authorized  to  rank  any 
number  of  players,  not  less  than  one  hundred,  by  grouping  them  into  classes  of 
one  or  more  to  each  class,  according  to  the  judgment  of  the  committee,  the  rank- 
ing to  commence  with  Class  1. 

By  way  of  illustration  only,  we  might  apply  the  plan  to  this  year  s  list  with 
the  "following  result : 

Class  1 R.  N.  Williams,  2nd 

Class  2 William  M.  Johnston 

Class  3 .  George  M.  Church,  R.  Lindley  Murray 

Class  4 Ichiya  Kumagae,  Clarence  Griffin,  W.  M.  Washburn 

Class  5 Willis  E.  Davis 

Class  6 .  ! J.J-  Armstrong 

Class  7 Dean  Mathey,  Harold  A.  Throckmorton,  Karl  Behr 

Etc..  etc..  etc. 
Naturally,  the  number  of  plavers  in  the  inferior  classes  would  be  larger. 
The  complete  ranking  for  Men's  Singles,  Men's  Doubles  and  Women's  Singles  for 
the  year  1916  is  appended  herewith. 

Respectfully  submitted.

?he  Hanking  Committee  notes  with  satisfaction  the  growing  interest  shown  by 
womon  tennis  phiyers.  as  evidenced  by  the  larger  numbers  entering  the  tourna- 

its,  and  in  new  ideas  and  suggestions  advanced  by  several  of  our  active  Eastern 

yefs. 

t  has  been  suggested  that  tlie  Eastern  and  Western  women  players  be  ranked 

arately,  because  they  s(  dorn  come  into  competition. 

?he  committee   considers   that   there   is   hardly  a    sufficient  number   of  active 

yers.  however,  in  the  East  and  West  to  necessitate  a  separate  ranking, 
he  Ranking  Committee  is  extremely  disappointed  in   not  being  able  to  rank 
player  from  Southern  California  this  year,  because  of  insufficient  data,  and 

5  wai  a  strong  factor  in  their  reaching  the  foregoing  decision. 

Respectfully  submitted, 

Helena  R.  Pouch,  Chairman.

Annual  Meeting  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

By  E.  B.  Moss,  New  Youk, 
riesidcnt  National  Association  Lawn  Tennis  Writers. 

The  annual  meeting  of  tlie  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  was  held  at  the  Waldorf-Astoria  Hotel,  New  York,  Friday 
February  9,  1017.  The  attendance  of  delegates  was  the  largest  in 
the  history  of  the  organization  and  a  vast  amount  of  business  was 
transjicted  during  the  afternoon  and  evening  sessions,  which  were 
separated  by  a  dinner.  The  Association  was  in  session  nearly  ten 
hours  and  matters  affecting  American  tennis,  both  routine  and  of 
great  importance,  were  discussed  and  acted  upon  by  the  representatives 
of   the   many   clubs  and   associations   present. 

Chief  among  these  were  the  proposed  changes  to  the  amateur  rule. 
Eight  acts  of  disbarment  were  proposed  and  of  these,  six  were  passed, 
one  defeated  and  the  other  first  amended  and  then  defeated,  when 
proposed  as  an  amendment  to  the  constitution.  The  proposed  rule 
curtailing  the  payment  of  expenses  to  players  engaged  in  tournament 
play  was  defeated,  the  vote  being  L5o  for  and  115  against.  178  votes 
being  necessary  to  pass,  under  the  two-thirds  ma.iority  rule.  Later, 
on  a  reconsideration,  the  rule  was  again  lost,  lilt)  votes  for  and  88 
against;  141  being  required  to  pass  it. 

The  proposed  amendment  to  the  rule  regarding  connection  with 
tennis  supplies  as  a  business,  was  defeated,  after  first  being  amended 
to  be  non-retroactive,  loT)  to  184  :  the  number  of  votes  being  neces- 
sary for  its  passage  being  178.  Among  amendments  to  the  amateur 
rule  adopted  was  one  providing  tliat  a  player  shall  lose  his  amateur 
status  by  permitting  or  sanctioning  the  use  of  his  name  to  advertise 
or  promote  the  sale  of  tennis  goods  for  pecuniary  profits  or  by  per- 
mitting his  name  to  be  advertised  or  published  as  author  of  books 
or  articles  on   tennis  of  which   lie  is  not  actually   the  author. 

Other  important  chantres  in  the  rules  include  a  change  in  the  method 
of  ranking  players  at  the  end  of  the  season.  Hereafter  not  less  than 
one  hundred  players  shall  be  ranked  in  classes  of  one  or  more, 
according  to  the  judgment  of  the  Ranking  Committee  :  the  ranking  to 
begin  with  Class  One.  It  was  also  voted  to  play  the  Doubles  Cham- 
pionship as  a  separate  tournament  in  the  future.

rational,  sectional.  State  or  titular  tournaments  was  defeated,  but 
the  proposal  to  form  a  National  Umpires'  Association  was  passed 
unanimously.  The  proposed  ounlifications  for  entry  in  the  National 
Singles   Championship   were   adonted   without   dissent.

pla.ving  season  under  consideration,  including  international  and  team

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  260 

(3)  The  Field  Secretary  shall  keep  a  separate  card  index  for  each 
season's  play,  in  which  (here  shall  be  recorded  all  matches  in  men's 
and  women's  singles  and  men's  doubles  played  during  that  season  in 
the  events  named  in  lUile  1  hereof.  There  shall  be  a  separate  card  for 
each  singles  player  and  a  separate  card  for  each  doubles  team.  As 
the  returns  are  received  under  Kule  2.  the  data  shall  be  recorded  on 
the  cards  as  soon  thereafter  as  possible,  with  the  result  that  the  com- 
plete record  of  any  individual  or  team  shall  appear  on  the  card  of 
such  individual  or  team.  The  full  names  and  post  office  addresses  of 
all  players  shall  appear  on  their  respective  cards. 

(4)  Each  year  there  shall  be  three  rankings,   as  follows: 

1.  Men's  singles ;  5n  which  at  least  100  individuals  shall 

be  named. 

2.  Men's  doubles ;   in  which  at  least  30  teams  shall   be 

named.

shall  be  named. 

In  each  case  the  individuals  or  teams  shall  be  divided  into  classes. 
Tliere  may  be  one  or  more  individuals  or  teams  placed  in  any  class. 
The  player  or  players  with  the  best  season's  records  shall  be  placed 
in  Class  1  ;  the  player  or  players  with  the  next  best  records  shall  be 
placed  in  Class  2,  and  so  on  for  any  number  of  classes,  according  to 
the  decision  of  the  Ranking  Committee. 

(5)  To  be  considered  for  a  ranking,  an  individual  or  team  must 
participate  during  the  season  in  at  least  three  sanctioned  events,  but 
on  the  unanimous  vote  of  the  Ranking  Committee  occasional  excep- 
tions to  this  rule  may  be  made.  An  individual  or  team,  however,  need 
not  necessarily  be  ranked  because  of  having  qualified  under  this  rule, 
if  in  the  opinion  of  a  majority  of  the  committee  the  data  furnished 
by  the  record  in  question  is  insufficient  for  the  purpose  or  the  standard 
of  play  does  not  warrant  any  ranking. 

(G)  The  rankings  shall  be  based  solely  upon  the  records  of  the 
players  for  the  season  under  consideration  and  not  upon  the  opinion 
of  the  Ranking  Committee.  Middle  and  late  season  performance  shall 
be  given  greater  consideration  than  that  of  the  early  season. 

(7)  Any  individual  or  team  may  be  ranked  irrespective  of  nation- 
ality or  place  of  residence. 

(8)  The  winners  of  National  Championships  shall  be  ranked  on  their 
season's  records  as  are  other  players  and  shall  not  be  ar))itraril.v 
placed  at  the  head  of  the  rankings,  but  in  a  comparison  of  their  rec- 
ords with  those  of  other  players,  they  shall  be  given  the  benefit  of 
any  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the  relative  merits  of  such  records. 

(9)  The  Ranking  Con^-uittee  shall  submit  its  report  to  the  Execu- 
tive Committee  at  the  meeting  of  tho  P^xecutive  Committee  held  iu

the  rankings  prior  to  the  publication,  thereof  by  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee.

NATIONAL  UMPIRES'  ASSOCIATION. 

The  growth  of  tennis  has  increased  the  demand  for  competent  offi- 
cials and  emphasized  their  importance  in  the  successful  conduct  of 
the  game.  Naturally,  therefore,  there  was  general  approval  at  the 
annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National  I>awn  'Tennis  Associa- 
tion of  the  proposal  to  organize  a  National  Umpires'  .\ssociation. 
Edward  C.  Conliu  of  New  York,    George  W.    Wightman  of  Boston  and 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  271 

Paul  W.  Gibbons  of  Philadelphia  were  named  as  the  committee  to 
undertake  its  organization. 

At  the  March  meetius  of  the  Executive  Committee  they  presented 
a  report  outlinins:  the  plan  on  which  they  are  working.  Membership 
in  the  Association  is  to  be  national  in  scope,  as  it  is  particularly 
desired  that  all  sections  of  the  country  be  represented.  Qualifications 
for  membership  ensure  that  every  person  joining  the  Association  is  a 
competent  official. 

Anyone  proposed  for  membership  must  have  his  application  endorsed 
by  the  president,  if  a  member  of  a  tennis  club ;  by  the  chairman  of 
the  tennis  committee,  if  a  member  of  a  country  club;  or  by  a  rank- 
ing player.  Applications  will  be  passed  upon  by  an  admission  com- 
mittee ("•oniposed  of  Richard  N.  Williams,  2nd,  of  Boston  ;  Simpson  M. 
Sinsahaugh  of  Los  Angeles,  J.  C.  Rohlfs  of  San  Francisco,  ,1.  C. 
Stewart  of  Chicago,  and  the  members  of  the  organization  committee. 
Applications  should  he  addressed  to  the  National  Umpires'  Associa- 
tion, Room  721,  20  Broad  Street,  New  York,  N.  Y.  Members  will  be 
given  an  insignia  which  will  be  honored  by  any  organization  holding 
a  tournament  under  sanction  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn 
Tennis  Association. 

By  securing  the  co-operation  of  clubs  belonging  to  the  United  States 
National  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  members  of  the  Umpires'  Associa- 
tion will,  wherever  possible,  be  placed  in  charge  of  officiating  at  sanc- 
tioned tournaments. 

To  ensure  uniformity,  a  pamphlet  is  being  compiled  to  serve  as  a 
code  of  instructions  as  to  how  to  run  a  match  and  to  apply  the 
rules.  It  is  believed  that  this  standardization  of  procedure"  will 
improve  tournament  play  throughout  the  country.  The  annual  meet- 
ing and  election  of  officers  will  take  place  at  the  time  of  the  national 
singles  championship. 

APPLICATIONS  FOR  TOURNAMENTS. 

Applications  for  officially  sanctioned  tournaments  for  1918  must  be 
made  to  Paul  B.  Williams.  Field  Secretary,  20  Broad  Street,  New  York

awarded  the  tournament    applied   for. 

By  Order  of  the  Executive  Committee, 

EDWIN    FULLER   TORREY,    Secretary. 


ANNUAL     MEETING     PLEDGES     SUPPORT     TO 
GOVERNMENT. 

The  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association.  February  9,  1917,  adopted  the  following  resolution: 

WHEREAS,  Our  country  is  facing  grave  international  difficulties, 
and 

WITERE.AS.  Wo.  the  assembled  delegates  of  the  United  States 
National  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  representing  directly  or  indirectly 
more  than  a  million  tennis  players  throughout  the  United  States ;  be  it 

RESOLVED,  That  we  hereliy  heartily  endorse  the  action  of  President 
Wilson  in  severing  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Cerman  Empire; 
that  we  pledge  to  the  President  and  the  Congress  of  the  United  States 
our  utmost  support  in  whatever  further  steps  they  deem  necessary  to 
maintain  American  rights  against  lawless  aggression,  and  that  to  that 
end  we  place  the  services  of  the  .Association  and  the  national  organiza- 
tion absolutely  at  their  disposal  ;  be  it 

RESOLVED,  That  the  Secretary  be  directed  to  transmit  a  copy  of 
this  resolution  to  the  President  and  Congress. 

RESOLVED.  That  the  Executive  Committee  be  authorized  to  cancel 
the  schedule  of  tournaments  for  1917,  if  in  their  discretion  the  inter- 
national relations  of  the  United  States  demand  such  action. 


272  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

No  National  Titles  in  Tennis  This  Year 

For  the  first  time  since  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association 
was  organized,  in  1881,  there  will  be  no  national  championships  this  year.  For 
the  first  time  since  1885  there  will  be  no  official  ranking  list.  There  will  be 
no  prizes  other  than  certificates.  Even  challenge  cups  will  remain  with  their 
present  holders  for  another  year. 

Tournaments  sanctioned  by  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Associa- 
tion will  be  played  as  scheduled  throughout  the  entire  country,  with  the  approval 
of  the  War  Department.  This  decision  was  reached  by  vote  of  the  Executive 
Committee,  to  whom  the  annual  meeting  of  the  National  Association  delegated 
authority  for  action  after  consulting  the  Federal  authorities. 

The  fact  that  the  schedule  will  be  carried  out  does  not  mean  that  customary 
conditions  will  prevail  in  tennis  this  summer.  There  will  be  no  prizes,  no  coni- 
petition  for  challenge  cups,  no  ranking  and  no  national  championships.  This 
means  that  there  will  be  no  incentive  for  a  man  to  neglect  his  duty,  military  or 
otherwise,  merely  for  the  pursuit  of  tennis  honors.  By  eliminating  the  lure  of 
championships,  ranking,  etc.,  it  will  be  impossible  for  such  tournaments  as  are 
held  to  become  a  hindrance  to  the  activities  of  the  Government. 

Clubs  belonging  to  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A.  will  be  urged  to  secure  the  largest 
possible  entry  list  for  their  tournaments,  aiming  at  quantity  rather  than  quality 
and  appealing  particularly  to  their  own  membership.  They  will  be  asked  tj 
make  no  effort  to  secure  prominent  players  from  other  parts  of  the  country  to 
compete.  Wherever  possible,  gate  receipts  for  tournaments  are  to  be  charged, 
and  the  net  proceeds,  together  with  the  entrance  fees,  are  to  be  turned  over  to 
the  local  and  national  organizations  of  the  American  Red  Cross.  Junior  and 
Boys'  tournaments,  in  particular,  are  to  be  actively  promoted. 

There  will  be  no  national  championships,  but  in  their  stead  will  be  held 
national  patriotic  tournaments.  The  patriotic  feature  will  be  emphasized  here 
as  in  all  events  held  by  the  clubs,  every  effort  being  put  forth  to  raise  large 
sums  for  the  Red  Cross.  Furthermore,  the  plajers  o£  the  country  are  urged  to 
respond  to  the  call  of  Congress  for  military  service,  and  all  not  thus  available 
are  urged  to  keep  in  good  physical  condition,  dispense  with  luxuries,  lead  a 
simple  life  and,  wherever  possible,  take  courses  in  military  training,  so  that  they 
may  become  a  military  asset  of  the  Government  in  case  of  necessity. 

These  proposals  were  set  forth  as  follows  in  a  letter  to  Newton  D.  Baker, 
Secretary  of  War,  signed  by  George  T.  Adee,  I'resideut ;  Robert  D.  Wrenn, 
Ex-President ;  Julian  S.  Myrick  and  Ward  C.  Burton  of  the  Executive  Committee 

"We,  the  undersigned  members  of  the  Executive  Comm'.ttee  of  the  United 
States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  believe  athletics  are  a  great  force  in 
developing  healthy  men  and  women,  and  for  that  reason  they  should  not  be  aban- 
doned in  this  crisis.  We  believe  that  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association,  through  its  influence  with  the  tennis  players  of  the  country,  who  are 
of  necessity  young,  strong  and  active,  can  l)e  of  invaluable  service  to  the  Govern- 
ment by  urging  these  players  to  respond  to  the  call  of  Congress,  by  furnishing, 
means  "and  incentive  to  those  not  called  to  take  outdoor  exercise,  thus  keeping 
themselves  in  good  physical  condition  ;  by  impressing  upon  all  the  necessity  of 
giving  up  luxuries  and  living  only  in  the  simplest  manner  ;  by  raising  money  for 
the  Red  Cross  as  described  below,  and  by  spreading  through  the  clubs  of  the 
Association  located  in  all  the  cities  of  the  United  States  the  idea  of  their 
responsibility  to  the  Government  and  their  duty  to,  arouse  the  patriotism,  the 
loyalty  and  the  spirit  of  sacrifice  among  their  memffers,  calling  upon  each  to  do 
something,  no  matter  how  small,  for  his  country. 

"To  carry  out  these  ideas  we  have  drawn  up  the  following  plan  and 
submit  it  to  the  Department  of  War  for  their  approval  or  disapproval,  ia 
whole  or  in  part :  «j 

"1.  Do  not  cancel  the  schedule  of  tennis  tournaments  for  1917.  Have  the 
220  tournaments,  awarded  to  the  clubs  of  the  Association,  located  in  the  various 
cities  of  the  country  from  Maine  to  California  and  from  the  Mexican  to  the 
Canadian  border  lines,  played  as  planned. 

"2.  Instruct  the  clubs  holding  tournaments  not  to  put  up  prizes  and  not  to 
have  competition  for  challenge  cups.  Charge  entrance  fees  to  the  players,  gate 
receipts  wherever  possible  and  turn  over  the  net  receipts  to  the  .\merican  Red 
Cross,    either   as   one   large    fund   or   as    contributions    to    the   local    chapters   of 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  271 

;h«>   Rod    Cross.      The    latter    method    will    probabl.v    raise    more   money    in    most 
ocalities. 

••:;.      Do  not  make  any  ranking  of  players  for  1917. 

"4.  Ho  not  hold  any  national  championship  tournaments.  In  their  place 
bold  national  patriotic  tournaments.  IJy  not  holding  the  championships,  by  not 
ijiving  prizes  and  by  not  having  any  ranking  of  players  for  1917  the  incentive 
for  any  player  to  give  up  everything  else  for  the  sake  of  tennis  fame  is 
taken   away. 

'.').  Instruct  clubs  to  make  no  effort  to  get  players  from  other  parts  of  the 
country  to  play  in  club  tournaments,  as  this  makes  it  necessary  for  the  player 
to  devote  a  week  or  more  away  from  his  work  simply  to  play  tennis,  and 
encouragi's  idleness.  Instruct  clubs  to  aim  ratlur  for  ((uantity  than  for  quality, 
for  a  large  entry  of  men  in  their  immediate  neiy:hl)orho<)d,  playing  jiractically 
all  uiatclies  aft(>r  :»  ::!()  in  the  afternoon.  This  will  permit  men  to  do  their  day's 
work  and  in  addition  will  give  them  the  chance  and  stimulus  for  outdoor 
exercise. 

(i.  Urge  the  tennis  players  of  the  country  to  respond  to  the  call  of  Con- 
gress in  raising  an  army  and  increasing  the  personnel  of  the  navy  in  accordance 
with  the  bills  to  be  passed  by  Congress  for  these  purposes.  Urge  players  who 
are  too  young  or  too  old  or  who  are  not  called  by  selective  conscription  to  take 
courses  in  military  training,  learn  all  they  can  about  military  affairs  and  keep 
in  good  physicil  condition,  in  order  to  fit  themselves  for  military  duty  in  case 
of  necessity,  and  urge  all  jilayers  to  give  up  luxuries,  to  save  in  every  possible 
way  and  to  lead  a   simple  life. 

•rrge  clubs  to  make  their  tournaments  into  patriotic  gatherings,  to  have 
formal  patriotic  ceremonies  and  to  do  their  utmost  through  entrance  fi>es,  gate 
receipts  and  other  means  in   their   power  to   raise  money  for  the  Red  Cross. 

"7.  I'la.v  the  entire  schedule  for  .luniors  and  Boys  as  planned  (no  one  over 
nineteen  is  eligilde  to  play),  including  the  national  championships,  and  encourage 
public  park  tournaments." 

This  letter  offered  the  optional  course  of  canceling  the  schedule  and  closed 
with  the  declaration  that  "The  Association  desires  to  act  not  for  the  good  of 
tennis,  but  for  the  liest  interests  of  the  country." 

Mr.  Burton  presented  this  letter  to  the  Secretary  of  War  and  discussed  the 
matter  thoroughly  with  him.  Secretary  Baker  express<>d  his  appreciation  of  the 
Association's  attitude  and  unhesitatingly  recommended  the  adojition  of  the  pro- 
posals it  had  outlined.  -Vt  the  bottom  of  the  letter  he  added  the  following 
notation  : 

"The  foregoing  recommendations  seem  to  me  admirable  and  I  am 
glad  to  recommend  their  adoption.  In  addition,  I  would  be  glad  if 
the  members  of  the  Association  who  do  go  into  the  military  forces 
could  be  requested  to  co-operate  in  all  efforts  to  establish  athletics 
in  the  training  camps  and  so  create  wholesome  recreation  for  the 
leisure  hours  of  soldiers  and  officers. 

"Newtox  D.  Baker, 

"Secretary  of  War." 

This  cordial  endorsement  by  the  War  Department  encourages  the  officers  of 
the  .National  Association  to  believe  that  the  tennis  public  will  join  heartily  in 
this  service  to  the  country.  Careful  consideration  of  the  plan,  so  far  as  it  has 
taken  drtinite  shape,  shows  that  it  offers  tremendous  possibilities,  not  only  for 
advancing  th(>  physical  preparedness  of  the  Nation,  liut  for  stimulating  that 
patriotic  enthusiasm  which  must  accompany  successful  national  endeavor,  and 
for  raising  larize  sums  of  money  for  the  use  of  the  Red  Cross. 

It  is  felt  that  these  wortl'.y  purposes  will  commend  themselves  to  tennis  clubs 
throuirbout  the  countrv  and  that,  by  their  generous  co-operation,  the  recom- 
mi'ndations  of  the  National  Association,  which  become  the  recommendations  of 
the  (Jovernment  through  Secretary  Baiter's  approval,  will  be  put  into  successful 
operation.

rigidly  enforce  the  Foot  Fault  Rule.  Clubs  holding  officially  sanctioned 
tournaments  are  requested  to  appoint  a  foot  fault  umpire  for  every  match 
and  to  include  in  the  printed  announcement  of  their  tournaments  the  direct 
information  that  "THE  FOOT  FAULT  RULE  WILL  BE  RIGIDLY  ENFORCED," 
together  with  a  copy  of  the  rule. 

The  National  Umpires'  Association  (formed  this  year)  will  make  every

Championship,"  and  shall  be  open  to  any  nation  which  has  a  recognized 
Lawn  Tennis  Association  or  Corresponding  Organization  ;  and,  for  the 
puiposes  of  the  Regulations,  Australia,  with  New  Zealand,  the  British 
Isles,  British  South  Africa,  Canada,  India,  Sweden  and  Norway,  and  the 
United  States  of  America  shall,  amongst  others,  be  regarded  as  separate 
Nations. 

2.  The  Nation  for  the  time  being  holding  the  International  Lawn 
Tennis  Championship  shall  hereinafter  be  termed  "The  Champion 
Nation." 

3.  The  Competition  shall  take  place  in  accordance  with  the  following 
regulations,  and,  except  in  so  far  as  may  be  agreed  upon  by  the  com- 
peting Nations  for  their  own  Tie,  with  'the  Laws  and  Regulations  of 
the  game  for  the  time  being  sanctioned  by  the  Champion  Nation. 

4.  The  management  of  the  Competition  shall  be  entrusted  to  a  Com- 
mittee, hereafter  termed  "The  Committee  of  Management,"  which  shall 
be  appointed  annually  by  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  or  Correspond- 
ing Organization  of  the  Champion  Nation. 

5.  The  Committee  of  Management  shall  make  all  arrangements  for 
the  preliminary ,  Tie  or  Ties  (if  any)  of  the  Competition  where  such 
preliminary  Tie  or  Ties  are  to  be  played  in  the  Country  of  the  Cham- 
pion Nation,  and  also  for  the  Challenge  Tie,  and  its  decision  in  respect 
of  all  such  arrangements  shall  be  final.  The  Committee  of  Manage- 
ment shall  also  have  power  to  depute  to  others,  in  any  preliminary 
Tie  or  Ties,  the  making  of  all  or  any  such  arrangements  as  may  be 
deemed  necessary. 

6.  Any  Nation  wishing  to  compete  shall  give  notice  to  the  Secretary 
of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  or  Corresponding  Organization  of  the 
Champion  Nation,  so  that  it  shall  reach  him  not  later  than  the  first

ment, the  weather  or  other  unavoidable  hindrance,  shall  have  made 
completion  impossible.  Competing  Nations  shall  arrange  among  them- 
selves for  the  playing  of  their  respective  Ties  upon  a  ground  or  grounds, 
and  upon  a  date  or  dates  convenient  to  those  concerned ;  but,  in  the 
event  of  an   agreement   not   being   arrived  at,    the    preliminary   Tie  or

belong  to  the  visiting  Nation  ;  or,  in  the  case  of  a  Tie  being  played  on 
neutral  ground,  one  third  each  to  the  visiting  Nations,  and  the  remain- 
ing fraction  of  profit  in  each  case  shall  go  to  the  Nation  in  whose 
Country  the   Tie  shall  be   played.

tains of  the  opposing  Sides  and  the  majority  of  the  Executive  Com-

and  Doubles  Contests,  and  if,  by  a  change  in  the  above  arrangements, 
he  be  called  upon  to  play  his  two  Singles  Matches  on  consecutive  days, 
then  there  shall  be  an  interval  of  one  day  between  the  second  and  the 
third  day's  play.  Provided,  nevertheless,  that  if  there  be  an  interval 
between  the  first  and  second  day's  play,  either  from  postponement, 
arrangement,  or  the  interval  of  a  Sunday,  there  shall  not  be  an  interval 
between  the  second  and  third  day's  play.

21.  The  above  Regulations  shall  be  binding  upon  the  Nations  con- 
cerned, and  shall  not  be  altered  except  with  the  consent  of  two-thirds

(2)  Active  Associations. 

(3)  Allied   Associations. 

(4)  Park  Associations. 

Allied  associations  shall  consist  of  associations  of  schools  or  colleges,  but 
such  associations,  if  they  so  desire,  may  become  active  associations  by 
notifying  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  and  paying  the  dues 
for  an  active  association.  Active  associations  shall  consist  of  all  associa- 
tions other  than  allied  and  park  associations  and  in  each  case  the  limits  of 
an  active  association  shall  necessarily  exclude  to  that  extent  the  limits  of 
every  other  association.  Park  associations  shall  consist  of  associations  of 
parks,  not  more  than  one  association  from  any  one  city,  and  approved  by

any  vote.  No  club  being  itself  a  member  of  the  National  Association  shall 
be  counted  as  a  member  of  an  active  association  in  determining  the  number 
of  votes  which  may  be  cast  by  such  association.  No  member  of  the 
National  Association  in  arrears  or  failing  to  have  paid  its  fiscal  dues  by 
the  first  of  February  each  year  preceding  the  annual  meeting,  shall  be

cially sanctioned  tournament  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  States 
National   Lawn  Tennis  Association. 

Sec.  3.  On  or  before  the  first  day  of  January  in  every  year  each  sub- 
association  shall  send  to  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  the

belonging  to  it  on  December  ist  preceding,  and  each  club  directly  a  mem- 
ber of  the  National  Association  shall  send  to  the  Secretary  of  the  National

shall  be  decided  by  toss ;  provided,  that,  if  the  winner  of  the  toss 
choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice  of  sides, 
and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by 
his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect 
not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ;  the  player 
who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and  the  other  the 
striker-out. 


SPAIJJING'S    I.AWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  289 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  hecome  server, 
and  the  server  sliall  become  striker-out ;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all 
the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

FOOT  FAULT  RULE. 
6.  Before  commencing  to  serve,  the  server  shall  stand  with  both 
feet  at  rest  behind  (i.  e.,  further  from  the  net  than)  the  base  line 
and  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary  continuation  of  the  half  court 
and  side  lines,  and  thereafter  the  server  shall  not  run.  walk,  hop, or 
jump  before  the  service  has  been  delivered,  but  the  server  may  raise 
one  foot  from  (and,  if  desired,  replace  it  on)  the  ground,  provided 
that  both  feet  are  kept  behind  the  base  line  until  the  service  has 
been  delivered. 

Official  Intcrprctntinn  of  Laic  G: 

If  a  foot  be  lifted  and  replaced,  there  must 
be  no  change  of  position  that  can  possibly  be 
considered  a  step. 

7.  The  service  shall  be  delivered  from  the  right  and  left  courts 
alternately,  beginning  from  the  right  in  every  game,  even  though  odds 
be  given  or  owed,  and  the  ball  served  shall  drop  within  the  service 
line,  half  court  line  and  side  line  of  the  court  which  is  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served  or  upon  any  such  line. 

8.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  server  commit  any  breach  of  law  7,  or  if 
he  does  not  stand  as  directed  in  law  6,  or  if  the  ball  served  drop  in 
the^  net,  or  beyond  the  service  line,  or  if  it  drop  out  of  c-ourt  or  in 
the*  wrong  court.  If  the  server  in  attempting  to  serve  miss  the  ball 
altogether,  it  does  not  count  as  a  fault;  but  if  the  ball  be  touched, 
no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  a  service  is  therebj"  delivered, 
and  the  laws  governing  the  service  at  once  apply. 

9.     A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same  court 
from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault  because  he 
served  from  the  wrong  court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after  the  next  sexwice  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  till  the  striker-out  is  ready.  If 
the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
counts  for  nothing. 

14.  The  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it  has 
touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law'  8,  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net;  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  service, 
or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return 


290  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

the  service  or  the  ball  In  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo 
Bent's  court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu- 
tive faults;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play;  or  if  he  return 
the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court ;  or  if 
he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by  law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  anything 
that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking ;  or 
if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once;  or  if  he  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports,  or  the  ground  toithin  Ms  opponenVs 
court,  while  the  ball  is  in  play ;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it  has 
passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a  permanent 
fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
jlermanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is  called  15 
for  that  player ;  on  either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the 
score  is  called  30  for  that  player ;  on  either  player  winning  his  third 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player ;  and  the  fourth  stroke 
won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for  that  player,  except  as  fol- 
lows :  If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called 
deuce ;  and  the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage 
for  that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the 
game ;  if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so 
on  until  one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the 
score  of  deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set,  except  as  fol- 
lows:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games  all: 
and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for 
that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of 
each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even.  It  shall, 
however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
©hange  sides,  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set  until  the  odd  and  con-

cludinjr  set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded  ;  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes ;  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  i)ostponenient,  the  previous  score  shall 
hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour,  the 
pla.ver  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
stay  In  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  when  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

2G.  If  a  pla.ver  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon. as  the 
mistake  Is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who  ought  to 
have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  In  the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  follows :

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall 
be  3G  feet  in  width ;  4^2  feet  Inside  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and  L  N.     The  service 

•  AH  matches  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  under  the  auspices  of 
the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  shall  be  the  best  two  in  three

side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve  in 
every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to  serve 
in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so,  and  the 
opposing  pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  plaj'er  who  served  in  the  first  game  shall  serve  in  the 
third,  and  the  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game 
shall  serve  In  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  in 
all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

31.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set,  either  partner  of  the  pair 
which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve;  and  the 
same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second  game  of  the 
new  set. 

32.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout  the 
game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  partner; 
and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established  shall  not 
be  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  courts  to  receive  the 
service,  till  the  end  of  the  set. 

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  between  the  ser- 
vice line,  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  as  provided  In 
law  33,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he  wears  or 
carries.

Cases  and  Decisions 

By    James    Dwight. 
Officially  recognized  ly  the  U.  8.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

I.  A  player  standing  outside  the  court  volleys  the  ball  or  catches 
It  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

II.  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count? 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.  If  he  attempts  to  return  the  service  he  is 
deemed  ready. 

IV.  The  striker-out  calls  "not  ready,"  for  a  second  service.  The 
ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out  claims  that  the 
fact  that  he  was  not:  ready  makes  no  difference,  since  a  fault  cannot 
be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — The    second    service    goes    for    nothing.      A    player 

^cannot   call   "not   ready,"   and  then   have  the    service   count,   or 

not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

v.     A   ball   having  been   played    over  the  net  bounds   back   into  the 

court  from  which  it  came.     The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 

It  before  it  falls.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  so? 

Decision. — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose   the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  over  the  net.      Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision. — Yes.     There  is  no  law  requiring  a   racket  to  be  in 
a   player's   hand   when   the   ball    is   returned.     It   would   unques- 
tionably  be  a   good  return   if  the   racket  were  held  against   the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 
.K.      A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.     A 
jilayn-    touches    the   net   beyond    the    inside   posts,   and    claims    that   he 


SPALDING'S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL.  295 

does  not    lose   the   stroke   because   there   should  be  no  net  more   than 

three  feet  outside  of  tho  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  pla.vers  shall  stand  on 
opposite  sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading 
his  opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
net   and  bounds  into   the  opposite  court. 

Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  The  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the 
court.     Can  it  he  returned? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is   returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary? 

Decision.— No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  return 
the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Yes,  if.  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played 
again,  because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrange- 
ments of  the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  jilaces  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played 
again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  T'he  server  had  previously  served  a 
fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  coui-t. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court  under  all   circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discove-fd.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  From  which  court 
should  he  serve  next? 

Decision. — Tlie  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  sei-vice,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being 
thirty-liftcen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke. 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  fli'st  service  it  is 


296  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL. 

simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  play- 
ers to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  won, 
when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.  What 
is  to  be  done  V 

Decision. — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that  the 
umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find 
that   the   umpire  has   called   "play."     Has  he  any   redress".' 

Decision. — ^]So. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
change  his  decision. 

Decision. — T'he  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
fall.     He  then  claims  to  have  the   stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 
XXVI.     The   ball    strikes   the   ground   close   to   a   line :    the   scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal   to  the  linesman,  the 
latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands'/ 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom  of  the 
net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return '.' 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  in 
play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault? 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is 
bis  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Decision. — No.  

UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 
(From  Lawn  Tennis.) 
Both    of    the    opponents    of    the   servers    in   doubles    are    strikers-out 
alternately  during  a  game.     It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  thi'oughout  each  set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that  ulti- 
mately falls  outside  his  court,  provided  he  does  not  touch  it  in 
doing  so. 


SPALDING'S    L,AWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  297 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  not 
touch  it,  bis  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
please  :  it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court  :  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits  of  the 
side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until   a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  ser\er  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
servpr  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  tliouRh  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  hall  is  dead  and  the  point  has 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net,  and  nothing 
which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good ; 
it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court :  he  may 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 

A  hall  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net  after 
havins;  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  TTie  point  counts 
in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches   the  net   in   doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  the  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
hits  him.   <ir  not. 

An  ofticiallv  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net— the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court, 
and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  he  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  any  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  Winning  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  does  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
the  (■f)nsolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts  :  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  m  the 
matter ;  it  docs  not  make  the  service  good  if  he   returns  it.

further  to  order  him  off  the  ground,  should  his  misconduct  appear  to 
them  to  justify  such  action,  but  before  such  action  shall  be  taken,  an 
opportunity  of  offering  an  explanation  shall  be  afforded  to  the  com- 
petitor whose  misconduct  has  been  reported  to  them.  When  the  whole

refuse  to  play,  or  shall  have  given  previous  notice  to  the  Referee  or  to 
a  member  of  the  Committee  that  he  cannot  play  in  the  next  round,  his 
adversary  shall  win  in  that  round,  unless  said  Competitor  shall  have 
been  formally  excused  for  a  deflnite  period  by  the  lleferee. 

19.  In  handicap  matches  the  competitors  shall  be  handicapped  by 
the  Committee,  or  by  a  Handicapper  appointed  by  the  Committee. 

20.  The  method  of  handicapping  shall  be  by  classes  as  follows: 

GIVEN    ODDS. 

Class  O — (Scratch). 

Class  Receives  Class  Receives 

1 1-sixth  of  15  10 1.5  and  4-sixths  of  15 

2 2-sixths  of  15'  11 15  and  5-sixths  of  15 

3 3-sixths  of  15  12 30 

4 4-sixths  of  1.5  13 30  and  1-sixth  of  15 

5 5-sixths  of  15  14 30  and  2-sixths  of  15 

6 15  15 30  and  3-sixths  of  15 

7 15  and  1-sixth  of  15  16 30  and  4-sixths  of  15 

8 15  and  2-sixths  of  15  17 30  and  5-sixths  of  15 

9 15  and  3-sixths  of  15  18 4)0 

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9,  start  from  the  figure  3- 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered is  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing 
odds)    should   be  classified  as  follows  : 

OWED    ODDS. 

Class                       Owes  Class                         Owes 

1 1-sixth  of  15  10 15  and  4-sixths  of  15 

2 2-sixths  of  15  11 15  and  5-sixths  of  15 

3 3-sixths  of  15  12 30 

4 4-sixths  of  15  13 30  and  1-sixth  of  15 

5 5-sixths  of  15  14 .30  and  2-sixths  of  15 

6 .15  15 30  and  3-sixths  of  15 

7 15  and  1-sixth  of  15  16 30  and  4-sixths  of  15 

8 15  and  2-sixths  of  15         17 30  and  5-sixths  of  15 

9 15  and  3-sixths  of  15         18 40)

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  307 

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
Inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table.  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.     In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed. 

2.S.  In  all  tournanipnts  sanctioned  by  the  Association  the  use  of 
spikes  longer  than  onc-tjuarter  of  an  inch  is  prohibited. 

24.  Every  organization  holding  an  event  sanctioned  by  the  United 
States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  must  furnish  the  Ranking 
Committee,  within  ten  days  after  the  completion  of  any  such  event, 
with  a  full  and  complete  report  of  all  matches  played  therein,  together 
with  the  full  name  and,  when  possible,  address  of  each  contestant. 

25.  The  Ranking  Committee  must  furnish  all  Clubs  and  Associa- 
tions holding  any  such  sanctioned  event  with  blanks  for  the  purpose 
of  making  the  returns  required  by  Regulation  24.  and  immediately  after 
the  Committee  shall  have  completed  the  ranking,  such  returns  must 
be  delivered  to  the  Secretary  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association. 

26.  If  any  Club  or  Association  fails  to  make  the  returns  required, 
provided  for  by  Rogulntion  24,  sanction  for  holding  by  the  delinquent 
of  any  tournament  during  the  following  year  may  be  refused  in  the 
discretion  of  the   Executive  Committee.

two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen 
series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  oddsi  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  same  quanti- 
ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is  required  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  Is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts. 
TTiese  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds 
or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  firet,  third,  seventh, 
nintti  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
sixth  and  corresponding  games   in   each   set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2),  fifteen 
and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  ^40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
""tries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap   into  classes  according  to 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  309 

the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  iu  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

in  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  hrst  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
w-ith  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may   be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

it  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases.  

HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  toumament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
official  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and  other  particu- 
lars. If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be  of  any  value. 

A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts  :  (ii)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  ; 
(3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  cliampionship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  ; 

(5)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee;  and 

(6)  the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
"Tournament  Regulations.") 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  as  prizes, 
for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
lawn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
change, and   therefore  not  engraved   until   after  the  toumament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper.  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
well  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  for  the  players.

SPAXDING'S    LAWN    TBNNIS    ANNUAL. 


The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
day  and,  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
'Phe  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
There  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  either,  particularly  on  the  south  side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
accommodations,  and  to  entertain '  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
seeing  that  they  are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  club 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
cakes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players  and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent. 


SCHEDULE  FOR  A  ROUND  ROBIN  TOURNAMENT. 

One  player  sits  out  each  time.  The  teams  play  four  games  each  round,  no 
matter  how  many  they  win  or  lose.  The  number  of  games  won  is  placed  in  the 
open  brackets  and  the  man  winning  the  most  games  at  the  end  of  the  fifteen 
frames  wins  the  tournament.

SPALDING'S    LAWS   TENNIS    ANNUAL.  311 

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  Is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  how  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,  light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it,  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60  x  120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one   netting  can  surround  all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  uo  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end.  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  drain  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in,  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes  are   put   in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use.  but  more  preparation  is  neces'^ary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  one 
foot  If  no  drains  are  required.  After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 
level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  right,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  broken 
stone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  egg,  will  answer 


312  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUATr. 

the  pi^rpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  layer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  stone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  is 
put  ou  tlie  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly  level.  Any  holes  or  depressions  that  appear 
from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is  covered. 

Every  well  built  court  should  be  graded  either  from  end  to  end  or 
from  side  to  side  to  an  extent  of  not  over  two  inches,  which  will 
suffice  to  drain  off  rain  water.  If  artificial  drainage  is  necessary  to 
keep  the  court  dry,  drain  pipes  can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the 
court  about  three  feet  outside  the  side  and  end  lines,  care  being 
taken  whereby  the  pipes  will  tilt,  following  the  grade  of  the  court  as 
far  as  possible,  thus  allowing  the  water  to  run  off.  The  best  drain 
pipes  are  six-inch-»  stone  sewer  pipe,  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters 
used  on  tiled  roofs,  which  should  be  sunk  in  the  ground  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock  and  filled  with  pebbles  or  fine 
cracked   stone. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  be  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  ,si.\  inches  in  thickness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  four  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
eight  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if 
it  is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  ;  while  it 
It  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  too  long  "after  rain,  or  its  surface  is 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  When  a  court  is  finally  covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 
watered  and  rolled  alternately  twice  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
Is  played  on  at  all,  and  any  "depressions  or  uneven  spots  corrected  as 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  After  the  first  heavy  rain 
storm  it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
It  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The  fine  seashore  sand  will  seldom  be  found  satisfactory  for  the 
surface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly  under  the  players' 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  dJ-ainage  more  diflicult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very  ricli  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to  the  surface.  It  is  also  well  to  use  coarse 
sifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  be  considered,  it  should  be  built 
by  an  expert,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations ;  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  sbould  first  be  care-  . 
fully  removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  "by  100  feet,  cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen 
inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the 
earth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavy  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  much  leveling  and  rolling, 
and  the  rolling  should  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by  rain  or  hose-pipe.  Any  inequalilies  which  the  heavy  pres- 
sure of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cut  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  sufficiently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sods  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  The  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again ;  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  313 

upon  untfl  new  blades  of  grass  appear  In  considerable  numbers.  If 
depressions  appear,  tlae  sod  at  tliat  spot  sliould  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
Inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way,  but  it  will  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  In  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

(irass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
Bickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  In  use,  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
weather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
Tlie  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.  In  every  case,  unless  it  be  of  grass,  and  the  lines  are 
to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  Irss  than  forty  feet  apart. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
In  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  :  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  jute  bagging  or  coarse  cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it ;  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  but 
If  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
It  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  balls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  The  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines. 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  It 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  It  as  often.     It  should  be 


814  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in,  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  be  done  in  the  fall. 

Worm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Particularly  in 
fertile  ground  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
Bod,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  it  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

When  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse'3 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  is 
soft,  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  rubber- 
Boled  shoes  without  heels. 

Of  the  various  other  kinds  of  courts,  namely,  asphalt,  concrete, 
cinder,  etc.,  the  asphalt  is  probably  the  better  type. 

The  asphalt  court  is  very  hard  and  fast,  giving  the  ball  a  much  higher 
bound  than  any  clay  or  gravel  court.  Hence  it  has  placed  an  additional 
premium  on  swift  serving,  smashing  and  volleying.  Aggressiveness — 
that  quality  which  is  absolutely  essential  for  first  string  champions — 
has  therefore  become  part  and  parcel  of  the  game  in  California. 
Asphalt  makes  the  attacking  game  imperative. 

Although  the  asphalt  court  lacks  many  of  the  attractions  of  the 
best  turf  and  clay  courts  (being  so  very  hard),  it  has  its  advantages. 
If  it  is  properly  constructed,  the  cost  of  its  upkeep  is  practically  nil 
compared  to  others.  Aside  from  freshening  up  the  lines  with  paint 
once  a  year  and  sweeping  it  free  from  dust  and  litter  occasionally, 
there  is  no  expense  of  cash  or  effort  necessary.  Then,  too,  it  can  be 
dried  with  brooms  and  mops  within  an  hour  or  less  after  the  hardest 
rain.  In  Eastern  climates  snow  could  readily  be  shoveled  and  swept 
off,  and  the  spring  thaw  would  never  feaze  it.  Furthermore,  the 
asphaltum  surface  is  perfectly  true.  No  bad  bounds,  except  on  ancient 
and  poorly  built  courts. 

The  Fay  Improvement  Company  of  San  Francisco,  the  leading  court 
builders  on  the  Coast,  have  kindly  supplied  the  following  specifications 
for  the  benefit  of  those  who  wish  to  install  asphalt  courts  : 

"The  area  of  the  court  should  be  60  x  120  feet.  The  ground  should 
be  graded  so  as  to  have  a  pitch  of  at  least  9  inches  in  120  feet  without 
any  crown  whatsoever.  The  subgrade  should  be  either  rolled  with  a 
small  steam  roller  weighing  two  and  one-half  tons,  or  with  heavy  hand 
rollers.  Upon  your  subgrade  place  four  inches  of  concrete,  or  if  you 
can  obtain  good  bedrock  macadam,  six  inches  of  that  will  serve  instead. 
Upon  this,  spread  one  inch  of  asphalt  wearing  surface,  which  should 
be  made  of  the  following  proportions  :  Asphalt  having  a  penetration 
of  70  to  90  degrees,  120  pounds  ;  powdered  limestone  or  cement,  150 
pounds ;  fine  sand,  possessing  not  over  three  per  cent  loam  or  mica, 
745  pounds.  The  foregoing  quantities  constitute  nine  cubic  feet  of 
finishing  material,  covering  an  area  of  one  hundred  feet  square  and  one 
Inch  thick.  Particular  pains  should  be  taken  in  ironing  and  hand 
rolling  of  the  asphalt  so  that  there  will  be  no  roughness  aftpr  the  final 
rolling.  There  should  be  two  hand  rollers  used  when  the  asphalt  is 
spread,  one  weighing  about  600  pounds,  followed  by  a  lighter  one 
weighing  close  to  400  pounds.  The  rakers  should  work  to  a  three- 
quarter  inch  surface  board  in  spreading  the  material.  Should  the  sub- 
grade  be  all  loam  or  material  that  opens  up  and  cracks,  it  would  be 
good  to  spread  about  two  inches  of  sand  before  the  concrete  base  or 
macadam  is  laid." 


S1'AIJ)ING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  315 

Concrete  courts  should  be  laid  in  blocks,  and  hare  a  possible  advan- 
tage over  asphalt  In  a  very  hot  climate,  as  they  will  not  get  soft  and 
spongy.  The  building  of  a  concrete  court  should  in  most  cases  be  left 
to  a  first-class  contractor. 

Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  construct,  but  have  the  disad- 
vantage of  being  very  dirty. 

In  regard  to  wood  courts,  which  are  becoming  quite  popular,  the  best 
plan  to  follow  would  be  to  consult  an  expert  court  builder.  Hemlock 
and  Louisiana  cypress  are  usually  the  two  best  kinds  of  wood  to  use. 
The  life  of  a  wood  court  is  usually  from  five  to  ten  years.

Tn  regard  to  board  courts,  it  is  in  the  lirst  place  essential  that  they 
should  be  firm  and  yet  spriTi>;y  and  made  as  near  the  ground,  if  out 
of  doors  (which  seems  to  be  the  popular  method  at  the  present  time), 
as  possible.  The  foundation,  of  a  wooden  court  should  be  of  heavy 
beams,  sufficiently  so  to  prevent  all  bending  or  giving.  The  boards 
laid  on  same  should  be  not  less  than  1%  inch  in  thickness  in  order 
to  obtain  the  best  results,  and  if  a  wooden  playing  surface  is  desired, 
the  boards  should  be  laid  %  inch  apart,  which  will  permit  rapid 
drainage,  and  after  having  been  laid,  same  should  be  painted  green 
with  white  marking  lines.  The  best  playing  surface  is  secured  by 
having  a  flap  of  heavy  canvas  made  by  a  sailmake'r,  which  will  be 
of  sufficient  size  to  not  only  cover  the  court,  but  also  extend  at  least 
10  feet  outside  the  boundaries  of  same.  This  canvas  should  be 
stretched  by  method  of  rope  passing  through  eyelets,  with  pulleys  at 
each  corner  of  the  court,  by  means  of  which  the  rope  can  be  con- 
stantly kept  tight.  After  the  canvas  has  been  laid  and  properly 
stretched,  it  should  be  painted  a  grass  green,  upon  which  white  mark- 
ing lines  11/.  inch  in  width  can  be  made.  A  canvas  covering  such 
as  this  is  of  somie  considerable  expense,  but  with  proper  care,  that  is, 
painting  same  sufficiently  often  during  the  winter  season  and  storing 
same  carefully  during  the  hot  months,  it  should  last  for  some  years. 
Wooden  courts  for  inside  play,  that  is.  covered  courts,  should  be  laid 
whenever  possible  on  wooden  Ijeams,  so  as  to  get  some  slight  spring, 
and  not  on  iron  or  concrete,  which  will  render  them  so  dead  as  to 
make  it  exceedingly  hard  for  the  players'  feet.
