GUS 
MALZAHN 


HEAD COACH (1ST SEASON) 


Gus Malzahn, who served as Auburn's offensive coordinator from 2009-11, 
isin his first year as Auburn's head coach. Malzahn, who won the Broyles Award 
as the nation’s top assistant coach in 2010 while helping the Tigers to the BCS 
National Championship, returned to Auburn after serving as the head coach at 
Arkansas State in 2012, where he led the program to the Sun Belt Conference 
title. He was named the program's 26th head football cach on December 4, 
2012. 

Known for his innovative offensive style, Malzahn has made a profound im- 
pac during each of his coaching stops at the collegiate level: Auburn, Arkansas 
State, Tulsa and Arkansas. 

“I'm grateful for the opportunity to become the head football coach at Au- 
burn University. It's an outstanding institution with a storied football program 
that | had the pleasure of experiencing first-hand for three years,” Malzahn said. 
“| deeply apprecate the confidence that Dr. Gogue, J ay Jacobs and the search 
committee had in my ability to turn this program around and to bring Auburn 
back to national prominence. This is a homecoming for me and | look forward to 
being reunited with the Auburn family.” 

Last season at Arkansas State, Malzahn led the Red Wolves to a 9-3 record 
and 7-1 conference mark, induding a seven-game winning streak They defeated 
Middle Tennessee, 45-0, on Dec. 1 to daim the Sun Belt championship and a 
berth in the GoDaddy.com Bowl on Jan. 6. 

A product of Fort Smith, Ark., Malzahn’s ASU offense was in the top 25 na- 
tionally in nearly every offensive category entering the bow! game, ranking 17th 
in total offense (481.8 ypg) and 21st in scoring offense (36.4 ppg) and rushing 
offense (217.4 ypg). Led by record-setting quarterback Ryan Aplin, who was 
named Sun Belt Player of the Year, the Red Wolves’ offense was 13th nation- 
ally in passing effidency (155.39 rating) and averaged 217.4 yards per game 
passing. 

Malzahn made an immediate impact during his tenure at Auburn, high- 
lighted by a record-setting offense in 2010 when the Tigers finished 14-0 and 
daimed the school’s first national championship since 1957. 

The 2010 Auburn offense set nine school records, including points in a sea- 
son (577), points per game (41.2), total yards (6,989), total offense (499.2), 
rushing yards (3,987), rushing touchdowns (41) and passing touchdowns (31).

Malzahn's record-setting offense in 2010 led the Southeastern Conference and finished in the top 10 nationally in six statistical categories. 

He coached Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton during the Tigers’ run to the 2011 BCS National Championship. Under Malzahn's guidance, 
quarterback Newton had one of the best single-season performances at the position in college football history. Newton threw for 2,908 yards and 30 
touchdowns, while rushing for 1,586 yards and 20 TDs on the ground en route to becoming the third Heisman winner in school history. 

Newton, the No. 1 overall draft pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, also won the school’s first-ever Davey O'Brien Award and Manning Award, given to 
the nation’s top quarterback. He also daimed the Maxwell Award, presented annually to college football’s top player, while also earning Assodated 
Press National Player of the Year and SEC Offensive Player of the Year awards. 

Newton became just the third player in FBS history to record 20 rushing and passing touchdowns in a single season and the first player in SEC 
history to throw for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards in a single season. 

He helped lead the Tigers to an 8-5 record in 2011, which induded a victory in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. The Malzahn-led Auburn offense had four 
players named to the All-SEC Team. 

Malzahn’s arrival in 2009 and style of offense marked a drastic turnaround from the 2008 season when Auburn struggled offensively. In a 
two-year period, the Tigers improved from a tie for 110th to seventh in the nation in scoring offense (from 17.3 to 41.2) and from 104th to seventh 
in total offense, It also took Auburn just six games in 2009 to score more points than it did in all 12 games in 2008. 

The striking numbers shouldn't have come as a surprise, as during Malzahn’s two seasons at Tulsa, his offenses there were also among the 
nation’s finest, ranking first nationally in total offense in 2007 and 2008. 

Tulsa's offense in 2007 established nine team school records and 12 individual records. The Hurricane also set nine Conference USA team 
records, while Tulsa quarterback Paul Smith broke an NCAA record by throwing for at least 300 yards in 14 consecutive games. 

The 2008 Tulsa offense averaged 569.9 yards per game and was second nationally averaging 47.2 points per games. 

Prior to his time at Tulsa, Malzahn coached one season at Arkansas, as offensive coordinator, coaching Heisman Trophy runner-up Darren 
McFadden and helping the Razorbacks finish fourth nationally in rushing offense at 228.5 yards per game. Two of Malzahn’s first three collegiate 
offenses ranked in the top 10 nationally in rushing, induding the 2008 Tulsa team and 2006 Arkansas squad. During Malzahn’s one season at 
Arkansas in 2006, the Razorbacks finished with a 10-4 record and were SEC West Division Champions. 

Malzahn's caching career began 
in his home state of Arkansas at the 
high school level. In 14 seasons as a 
high school head coach, Malzahn led 
seven teams to the state championship 
game and won three titles. Malzahn 
coached two quarterbacks, Josh Floyd 
and qurrent Auburn offensive coordi- 
nator Rhett Lashlee, who set national 
passing records. Malzahn also tutored 
2005 Gatorade, Parade Magazine 
and Rivals.com National Player of the 
Year Mitch Mustain at Springdale High 
School. 

In} uly 2013, he was inducted into 
the Arkansas High School Sports Hall 
of Fame, 

Malzahn is married to the former 
Kristi Otwell and they are the parents 
of two daughters, Kylie and Kenzie.

FOUNTAIN 


SPECIAL TEAMS/TIGHT ENDS COACH 


After spending four seasons as Auburn’s player personnel director, Scott Fountain 
has returned to the field as the Tigers’ spedal teams coordinator and tight ends coach 
for the 2013 campaign. 

“Scott is someone | tried to hire as an assistant coach for my staff at Arkansas

dous work ethic, and his strong ties in the state of Alabama are a great asset to our 
program.” 

Fountain, a part of three ACC and an SEC championship team, was a key figure 
in Auburn's administrative and recruiting efforts from 2009-12, helping the Tigers 
sign three consecutive Top 10 recruiting classes. He came to Auburn along with Coach

Some of the notable players he has coached indude Ryan Flinn (UCF punter who 
spent four seasons in the NFL with the Cowboys, Falcons, Packers and Dolphins); 
Matt Prater (UCF kicker who now holds the franchise tag for the Denver Broncos); 
and Leonard J ohnson (an all-Big 12 player who set an NCAA record for kick return 
yardage at lowa State and is now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). He also mentored

in 1988 and a master’s degree in educational leadership from Florida State in 1998. 

A native of East Brewton, Ala., Fountain is married to the former Rosie Hidalgo, 
who attended Valenda (Fla.) Community College and lowa State. They have four 
sons: Brookes, Hunter, Tanner and Skyler.

the Plains from 1990-95, Garner will tutor the defensive line daily in practice. Garner 
spent the previous 15 years at Georgia in a similar capadty. “Rodney is one of the top 
defensive line coaches in college football who has had great success in the Southeast- 
ern Conference,” said Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn. “We're excited to welcome an 
Auburn man back home.” 

A native of Leeds, Ala., Garner was named All-SEC offensive line and honorable

HORTON 


RUNNING BACKS COACH 


SEC veteran Tim Horton serves as the running backs coach at Auburn, after six 
successful seasons in a similar capacity at Arkansas, where he was also recruiting c- 
ordinator. “Tim is a true professional and an outstanding coach and recruiter, who 
deserves a lot of credit for Arkansas’ success while he was there,” Auburn head coach 
Gus Malzahn said. “Tim is a man of character who will be a great complement to our 
staff and a tremendous representative of the entire Auburn family.” 

A 23-year coaching veteran, Horton was recognized by Rivals.com and ESPN.com as 
one of the nation’s top recruiters during his tenure at Arkansas and was one of just two 
coaches in the nation, and the only one in the SEC, to coach four different 1,000-yard 
rushers from 2007-10. Under his watch, Darren McFadden and Felix J ones earned 
All-America honors, while Dennis J ohnson and Knile Davis earned All- SEC honors. 

Horton's first dass as Arkansas’ recruiting coordinator in 2008 featured wide receiv- 
ers Joe Adams, J arius Wright and Greg Childs, all selected in the fourth round of the 
2012 NFL Draft. With their selections, Arkansas tied a draft record with three receivers 
taken in the same draft. It was the 14th time in draft history, and third by an SEC team, 
three receivers from the same school were taken in the same draft and the sixth time 
all three were picked in the first four rounds. 

During his six years at Arkansas, Horton coached two of the top four single- season 
rushing performances and more than a third of the 10 Razorbacks in school history to 
rush for more than 1,000 yards. 

In 2011, Horton helped the Razorbacks tie a school record with 11 wins and, com- 
bined with a 10-win season in 2010, marked just the third time in school history and 
first since 1988-89 UA reached double-digit win totals in back-to-back seasons, Ar- 
kansas led the SEC in total offense in 2011, averaging 438.1 yards per game, for the 
second time in the previous three seasons, and topped the SEC in scoring offense (36.8 
ppg) in 2011. All-SEC performer Dennis Johnson's 6.3 yards-per-carry average was 
second among the SEC’s top-10 rushers. 

Under Horton's tutelage, Davis posted the fourth-highest single-season rushing 
total in Arkansas history in 2010 as he ran for 1,322 yards and became just the 10th 
Razorback to edipse 1,000 rushing yards in a season. Davis was named a first-team 
all-SEC performer and led all SEC running backs with his average of 101.7 yards per 
game on the ground and finished the season with five consecutive 100-yard rushing 
games. 

Horton, who played football at Arkansas from 1986-89, returned to his alma mater 
in 2007, where he coached McFadden and J ones to All-America honors. McFadden was 
the Heisman Trophy runner-up and won the Doak Walker Award as the nation’s top 
running back in that season. McFadden finished the 2007 season with a school-record 
1,830 yards and 16 touchdowns. 

He came to Arkansas after taking the offensive @ordinator and wide receivers 
aching position at Air Force in January, 2007. During the 2006 season, he was the 
running backs coach at Kansas State, helping the Wildcats earn a Texas Bowl appear- 
ance. At KSU, Horton coached two future NFL running backs in Thomas Clayton and 
James] ohnson. 

Prior to Kansas State, he was at Air Force from 1999-2005, serving as the wide 
receivers coach from 1999-2004 and the running backs coach in 2005. Horton was 
recognized by the Colorado Chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes as one of its 
coaches of the year in 2004.

ence championships in 1991 and 1995 and five appearances in the NCAA Division I-AA 
playoffs. The 1995 Mountaineers were the first Division | team to go undefeated in 
North Carolina college football history.

senior in 1989. Horton also returned 78 punts for 657 yards in his collegiate career, 
fifth all-time in school history. 

Horton's four years at Arkansas proved to be among the most successful in school 
history as the Razorbacks compiled a 38-11 record, won back-to-back Southwest Con- 
ference titles in 1988 and 1989 and appeared in four straight bowl games. Horton's 
graduating dass remains tied for the school record for the most wins in a four-year 
period.

THE AUBURN EAGLES 


For more than 100 years, eagles have been associated with Auburn University’s 
football program. From a static presence on the sidelines to rousing flights over 
the field, WAR EAGLE has become an Auburn icon. 


The role of Auburn University’s eagles is to promote wildlife conservation as a part 
of the education initiatives of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the College of 
Veterinary Medicine's Southeastern Raptor Center. The USF&WS permits the Rap- 
tor Center to house eagles and use them on hundreds of educational presentations 
each year - induding Auburn's home football games. Currently, three flighted 
eagles and numerous other non-releasable raptors are used for these educational 
programs. Eagles stir emotions in many people as they have come to symbolize 
strength, power and courage as well as other important values such as freedom, 
American heritage and the preservation of our environment. Golden Eagles Tiger 
(War Eagle VI), Nova (War Eagle VII) and Spirit (a Bald Eagle) are the eagles who 
have inspired football fans with their graceful flights over | ordan-Hare Stadium. 


“WAR EAGLE" 

Auburn's battle cry, not Auburn's nickname. There 
are several legends concerning the origin of the War 
Eagle battle cry, dating back to 1864 and the Civil 
War at the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia.

TIGER WALK: 
AN AUBURN TRADITION 


Tiger Walk is an Auburn tradition which began in the early 1960s when 
Auburn players would walk from Sewell Hall to the football stadium and fans 
would line Donahue Drive to wish them well. Over the years Tiger Walk has 
grown into a major part of game day at Auburn, so much so that it is listed 

on the players’ game weekend itinerary. The largest Tiger Walk is believed 

to have taken place prior to the 1989 Iron Bow! when more than 20,000 

well wishers lined the street. Every Tiger Walk prior to home games draws 
thousands, and, over the last couple of years the Tiger Walk has become a 
standard as Auburn football players enter stadiums on the road. Tiger Walk is 
two hours before kickoff for every game.

ROLLING TOOMER'S

The center of town where the Auburn University campus meets 
the City of Auburn, Toomer’s Corner, where College Street 
intersects Magnolia Avenue, has long been the gathering place 
for Auburn athletic celebrations. After any football win, and 
significant victories in other sports, Auburn students and atizens 
alike join forces to “roll” the trees (and anything else that 
doesn’t move) at Toomer’s Corner with toilet tissue. Celebra- 


W iW tions after significant football victories can go on for hours and 
THE ROLL CALL leave the heart of town looking like a blizzard passed through. 
On Saturday, April 20, 2013, the Auburn Family showed that not only is the 
Auburn Spirit is alive and well, but itis soaring to new heights! More than 
83,000 fans filled J ordan-Hare Stadium to set an attendance record for A-Day, 
and later that evening they celebrated into the night with one final roll of the 


Auburn Oaks at Toomer’s Corner. Generations gathered beneath the oaks one 
final time, sharing stories and creating memories that will last a lifetime.

Keeping alive the tradition of rolling Toomer’s Corner is important to the entire Auburn Family. 
The university has partnered with the City of Auburn to create structures suitable for rolling at the 
Magnolia Avenue-College Street intersection. Fans will gather there as they always have follow- 
ing big victories or other momentous occasions to celebrate. 


Set to be implemented in 2014 is a new Samford Park area at Toomer’s Coner that will indude 
the planting of two oak trees. The new design will place trees farther back from the intersection; 
maintain the existing and historic character of the corner; retain the 1917 gates in their aurrent 
positions; add more seating and shaded areas; and indude the planting of additional trees 
along a aurved walkway through Samford Park. The design was selected after a series of public 
workshops and an online survey in which more than 10,000 alumni, students, fans and friends 
provided opinions and ideas.

PRO DAY 


Auburn's NFL prospects spend one day each spring showcasing their talents 
in front of more than 100 members of the media and NFL representatives, 
induding scouts, coaches and general managers who converge on The Plains 
for Pro Day. 


Pro Day gives NFL scouts and executives an opportunity to view potential Au- 
burn pro prospects first hand through a series of drills, induding the 40-yard 
dash, bench press, vertical jump and the three-cone drill, the same regimen 
followed at the NFL Combine. 


The event was held at J ordan-Hare Stadium in 2011 and was moved into the 
new Indoor Practice Faality in 2012, providing an ideal setting for the Tigers 
to showcase their talents. 


In 2011, Auburn's Pro Day was shown live on the NFL Network and ESPN3. 
Members of the local, regional and national media are also regular fixtures 
at Auburn's annual Pro Day.
