ORDER P-280 

APPEAL P-910122 

Institution: Ministry of Transportation 
MARCH 12, 1992 

(ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER MITCHINSON) 


KEYWORDS 
personal information * correspondence 
¢ danger to safety or health * confidential- 


ity provision in other Act 


The appellant requested access to medi- 
caland psychiatricassessments requested 
by the institution, and to the name of the 
person who submitted the letter which 
precipitated the institution’s request for 
the assessments. 

The institution provided the appel- 
lant with a copy of a “Driver’s Medical 
Information Report” and denied access 
to the letter under section 20 of the Act. 

The appellant appealed the institu- 
tion’s decision to deny access to the 
letter. 


ORDER 
The head was ordered to disclose the 
record to the appellant. 


The information contained in the record 
qualified as the personal information of 
the appellant, and not the affected per- 
son. Because evidence which would 
raise a reasonable expectation that dis- 
closure of the record would seriously 
threaten the safety or health of an indi- 
vidual had not been provided, the re- 
quirements for exemption under section 
20 were not met. 

The affected person raised the appli- 


cation ofaconfidentiality provision. The 


confidentiality provision referred to is 


not listed in section 67(3), nor does it 
specifically provide that it prevails over 
the Act. Consequently, the Act pre- 
vailed. 7

KEYWORDS

The appellant requested access to a two 
page memorandum prepared by a law- 
yer from the institution’s Legal Services 
Branch concerning the institution’s ac- 
cess to client files at a Family Services 
Centre. 

The institution denied access to the 
record under section 19 of the Act. 

The appellant appealed the institu- 
tion’s decision, claiming that a solicitor- 
client relationship did not exist, and that 
the issue considered in the record was a 
matter of compelling public ir-terest. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The record was prepared by an em- 
ployee who qualifies as “Crown coun- 
sel”, and was prepared to offer ongoing 
legal advice in the context of a matter 
under dispute. Because the record was a 
legal opinion which provided the inter- 
pretation of an agreement and advised 
the program manager regarding legal 
options to consider in attempting to 
resolve the matter, it qualified for ex- 
emption under section 19. 

Though the appellant made repre- 
sentations which dealt with the subject 
matter of section 23 of the Ac¢, section 23 
was not considered as it does not apply to 
section 19 of the Act.

The appellant requested access to infor- 
mation concerning the academic back- 
eround and professional experience ofan 
employee of the institution. 

The institution denied access to the 
record under section 21 of the Act. 
The appellant appealed the institution’s 
decision. During mediation, the parties 
agreed that the only record which re- 
mains at issue is a copy of the employee’s 
resumé. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The record contained information which 
qualified as personal information of the 
affected person. The personal informa- 
tion satisfied the requirements of a pre- 
sumed unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy under section 21(3)(d). Nocom- 
bination of the factors mentioned in 
section 21(2) existed to outweigh the 
presumed unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy. As such, the record quali- 
fied for exemption under section 21 of 
the Act. 

Section 23 did not apply, as there was 
no public interest in the disclosure of the 
records.

The appellant requested access to records, 
including statements made by three 
named individuals, which precipitated a 
letter of reprimand being placed on the 
appellant’s personnel file. 

The institution granted partial access 
to the record, citing exemptions under 


sections 21 and 49(b) of the Acz. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The record contained information which 
qualified as personal information of the 
affected persons and the appellant. Sec- 
tions 21(2)(f) and (h) were relied upon 
by the institution and the affected per- 
sons, and were found to be relevant 
considerations. Section 21(2)(d) was 
referred to in substance by the appellant, 
but was found not relevant in the context 
of this appeal. As such, the record quali- 
fied for exemption under section 49(b) of

The appellant requested access to records 
relating to a company’s applications for 
listing of a drug in the Ontario Formu- 
lary. 

The institution provided partial ac- 
cess to the records, citing exemptions 
under sections 17, 19 and 21 of the Acz. 

The appellant appealed the institu- 
tion’s decision to withhold parts of the 
records, and claimed that the contents of 
the institution’s decision letters did not 
satisfy the first two requirements of sec- 


tion 29(b) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decisions to exempt 
parts of records under sections 17, 19 and 


21 were partially upheld. 


The institution acknowledged that its 
first two decision letters did not provide 
reasons, as required by section 29(1)(b)(i). 
It has undertaken to ensure that this 
section is fully complied with in the 
future. 7 

One record was found to be a confi- 
dential communication between a client 
and a legal advisor directly related to 
seeking, formulating or giving legal ad- 
vice such that the requirements for ex- 
emption under the first branch section 
19 were satisfied. A record which did not 
relate to seeking formulating or giving 
legal advice; was not created or obtained 
for the lawyer’s brief for existing or con- 
templated litigation; and was not pre-

pared for use in giving legal advice, in 
contemplation of litigation or for use in 
litigation did not satisfy the requirements 
of either branch of the section 19 exemp- 
tion. 

Parts of a written submission relating 
to drug interchangeability data provided 
to the institution by an affected party 
were found to contain scientific, techni- 
cal and commercial information sup- 
plied to the institution in confidence, the 
disclosure of which would significantly 
prejudice the competitive position of the 
affected party. Because master formulae 
for drugs listed in the Ontario Formulary 
must be filed with the institution and the 
drug to which one of the severances 
relates is now so listed, the prospect of 
disclosure of the master formula avail- 
ability information (not the master for- 
mula itself) did not give rise to a reason- 
able expectation of the types of harm 
listed in section 17(1)(a),(b) or (c). 

The name of a person, which did not 
appear with other personal information 
about the individual, was found not to 
qualify as “personal information” as de- 
fined in section 2(1), and therefore could 
not qualify for exemption under section 
21 of the Act. The names of other persons 
who had reviewed drug products for the 
institution were found to qualify as per- 
sonal information. 

Direct reference was made to Order 
P-235, which found that the concerns of 
the institution and the reviewers about 
the importance of maintaining confi- 
dentiality to preserve the integrity of the 
drug review process and avoid the harass- 
ment and lobbying on the part of drug 
manufacturers were found to outweigh 
the appellant’s arguments that the iden- 
tity of these individuals was necessary in 
order to assess the quality of their reports. 
The appellant was given the opportunity 
to distinguish the present appeal from 
that in Order P-235, but did not re- 
spond. The disclosure of the reviewer's 
personal information would bean unjus- 


tified invasion of their personal privacy 
under section 21 of the Act.

The appellant requested access to a com- 
plaint file held in the Professional Stand- 
ards Branch of the Ontario Provincial 
Police. 

The institution provided partial ac- 
cess to the records, citing exemptions 
under sections 13, 14(1)(a), 14(2)(a), 19 
and 21 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision to withhold 


the record was upheld. 


The information contained in the record 
qualified as the personal information of 
the appellant, and portions of the record 
contained information that also quali- 
fied as the personal information of the 
affected persons. The portions of the 
record which contained the personal in- 
formation of both the appellant and the 
affected persons satisfied the requirements 
of a presumed unjustified invasion of 
personal privacy under section 21(3)(d). 
The appellant relied on section 21(2)(d), 
but it was found not relevant in the 
context of this appeal. As such, the 


information qualified for exemption 


under section 49(b) of the Act. 

Disclosure of part of the record would 
reveal advice and/or recommendations 
of a public servant, and qualified for 
exemption under section 13 of the Act. 

Distinct from other employment-re- 
lated disciplinary matters, the record at 
issue was created in the course of an 
investigation of conduct that was “un- 
lawful” in the sense that it constituted an 
offence against discipline under a regula- 
tion. On conviction of an offence against 
discipline, an appeal could be made to 
the Ontario Police Commission. The 
Ontario Police Commission was found 
to constitute a “courtortribunal” and,on 
appeal, had the power to impose a sanc- 
tion or penalty independently of the 
Police Commissioner (employer). As 
such, the circumstances surrounding the 
creation of the record were found to 
qualify as “law enforcement” as defined 
in section 2 of the Act. Because the matter 
had been appealed and the appeal body 
could hear further evidence and had the 
option to order anew hearing, the matter 
was not completed. As the ability to 
conduct these proceedings without in- 
terference is vital to the institution’s ef- 
fectiveness in carrying out its responsi- 
bilities and. mandate, the information 
qualified for exemption under section 
14(1)(a)of the Act. 

Part of the records was an account of 
the results of an investigation of allega- 
tions against the appellant, related to the 
enforcement of the Police Act, and was 
created by a member of the Ontario 
Provincial Police. Assuch, it qualified for 
exemption under section 14(2)(a) of the 


Act.

The appellant requested access to infor- 
mation pertaining to discussions between 
the institution and a company involved 
in the truck and trailer industry. The 
requester sought access to studies, letters 
and other materials about one of the 
company’s plants which had closed. 

The institution provided partial ac- 
cess to the records, citing exemptions 
under sections 12, 13, and 17 of the Act. 

During mediation of the appeal, the 
scope of the appeal was narrowed to those 
records where section 17 was the only 
exemption relied upon. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision was partially 


upheld. 


The information contained in the record 

qualified as commercial, financial and/or 
labour relations information, and was 
supplied by the affected party in expli- 
citly or implicitly in confidence. 

The disclosure of certain specific 
financial information relating to the com- 
pany’s capitalization, including budget 
statements and re-financing arrange- 
ments, could prejudice the affected 
party's current competitive position and 
was found to be exempt under section 
Lee 

Sufficient evidence to establish that 
the disclosure of the more general infor- 
mation would give rise to one of the types 


of harms specified in sections 17(1)(a), 
(b) and (c) had not been provided, and 
therefore section 17(1) did not apply. 
In his representations, the appellant 
raised the application of section 23. Be- 
cause there was not a compelling public 
interest in the information found exempt 
under section 17, section 23 did not 


apply.

The appellant requested access to infor- 
mation pertaining to evolution of the 
drafting ofa section ofa regulation made 
under the Highway Traffic Act. The 
appellant indicated that its objective was 
to ascertain why a specific class of driver 
was exempted from the daily trip inspec- 
tion requirement referred to in the regu- 
lation. 

The institution issued a fee estimate. 
The appellant paid.a deposit equal to one 
half of the fee, and requested a fee waiver. 
The institution waived the remaining 
half of the fee, and disclosed the record. 

The appellant appealed the institu- 
tion’s response, claiming that the institu- 
tion had incorrectly interpreted his re- 
quest and as a result the fee should be 
refunded because the record was not 
responsive to his request. The appellant 
also claimed that an additional record 
existed which was responsive to his re- 
quest which had not been disclosed. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision was upheld. 


Because there was no apparent ambigu- 
ity on the face of the appellant's request, 
it was capable of interpretation and re- 
sponse by the institution without clarifi- 
cation. 

The Assistant Commissioner was 
satisfied that the institution made 
reasonable efforts to locate all records 
responsive to the request, and that the 
records disclosed were all responsive to 
the request. 

In view of the reduction of the fee and 
the description of the search operations 
undertaken by the institution contained 
in its submissions, the fee charged by the 
institution was found to have been ap- 
propriate and in accordance with section 


57 of the Act.

The appellant requested access to the 
Board of Directors meeting minutes for 
the period of October 15, 1989 through 
May 2, 1990. 

The institution provided partial ac- 
cess to the records, subject to severances

ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 


the records to the appellant. 


Because the institution’s representations 
on section 17(1)(a) referred to harm to 
the institution’s own economic or com- 
petitive interests, section 17(1)(a) was 
found not applicable. 

All severances described decisions 
taken by the Board, not suggested courses 
of action. This information is properly 
characterized as factual information 
rather than advice, and does not qualify 
for exemption under section 13 of the 
Act. 

The information was found not to 
have monetary or potential monetary 
value and therefore could not be exempt 
under section 18(1)(a) of the Act. 

The severances did not contain infor- 
mation the disclosure of which could 
reasonably be expected to prejudice the 
economic interests or the competitive 
position of the institution, and therefore 
did not qualify for exemption under 
section 18(1)(c). 

Detailed and convincing evidence of 
the harm contemplated by section 
18(1)(d) and (e) was not provided by the 
institution, and the severed information 
did not, therefore, qualify for exemption 
under section 18(1)(d) or (e). 

The evidence provided by the institu- 
tion in support of its claim that section 
18(1)(g) applied to exempt the severed 
information was found to be speculative 
at best, and not sufficient to satisfy the 
requirements of section 18(1)(g) of the 
Act.

The appellant requested access to infor- 
mation regarding the accidental release 
of a named inmate from the Windsor 
Jail. 

The institution denied access to the 
records pursuant to section 21 of the Act. 


ORDER ' 

The institution was ordered to disclose 
the records to the appellant, subject to 
the severance of the name and institution 
number of the named individual. 


The records contained the personal in- 
formation of the named former inmate. 
The records recounted an administrative 
error made by the institution, not a pos- 
sible violation of law by the former in- 
mate, therefore the requirements for a 
presumed unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy under section 21(3)(b) of 
the Act were not satisfied. The promo- 
tion of public health and safety [section 
21(2)(b)] and the potential for unfair 
damage to the former inmate’s reputa- 
tion [section 21(2)(i)] were found to be 
relevant considerations. Severance of the 
name and institution number from the 
records was found to be sufficient to 
protect the former inmate’s reputation 
while promoting public health and 
safety.

The appellant requested access to a copy 
of a plan of survey which was commis- 
sioned and paid for by a private citizen 
respecting a proposed road to be built 
over Crown land to individual proper- 
ties. The record was not registered, so it 
was not publicly available under the Sur- 
veys Act. 

The institution denied access to the 
records pursuant to sections 17(1)(a) and 
(b) of the Act. During the course of 
mediation, the institution also raised the 
application of section 18(1)(a) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The head was ordered to disclose the 
record to the appellant. 


The burden of proving a reasonable ex- 
pectation of harm to the affected person 
if the records were disclosed was not 
discharged. This type of record is nor- 
mally registered under the Surveys Act 
and, therefore, publicly available. Simi- 
lar information would continue to be 
supplied, and undue gain to any person 
would not result given that the record is 
one that is normally publicly available. 
Accordingly, section 17(1)(a) and (b) 
did not apply. 

While there are fees chargeable for the 
preparation ofa plan of survey, the infor- 
mation itself did not have monetary value 
for the institution, nor was there an 
indication of an intention to provide the 
record in any way that would result in

The appellant requested access to a copy 
of every record relating to review and 
consideration of the submission by a 
drug company for the listing of a drug in 
the Ontario Formulary, with the excep- 
tion of records originating from the drug 
company. 

The institution granted access to 18 
records, provided partial access to four 
records with severances pursuant to sec- 
tion 21 of the Act, and denied access to 
four other records pursuant to section 19 
of the Act. During the course of media- 
tion, the institution also raised the appli- 
cation of section 18(1)(a) of the Acz. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The information severed from the records 
pursuant to section 21 of the Act was 
similar in nature to the information at 
issue in Orders P-235 and P-284, which 
dealt with similar requests to the same 
institution by the same appellant. The 
appellant did not establish a change in 
circumstances since the issuance of those 


orders which would distinguish this ap- 
peal from the previous ones. Therefore, 
section 21 was applicable. 

The records which were withheld 
under section 19 of the Act were confi- 
dential written communications between 
a lawyer and a client, which were directly 
related to seeking, formulating or giving 
legal advice and were properly exempt 
under section 19 of the Act.

The appellant requested access to the 
contents of the Health Disciplines Board’s 
file regarding the appellant. 

The institution granted access to 90 
records, and provided partial access to 11 
records with severances pursuant to sec- 
tion 49(b) of the Act. During the course 
of mediation, the scope of the appeal was 
narrowed to only one paragraph of a 
letter written by a doctor to the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons in the con- 
text of the Health Disciplines Board’s 
review involving the appellant. The in- 
stitution withdrew its claim for exemp- 
tion under section 49(b) and indicated 
that it was relying instead on section 21 


of the Act. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the severed paragraph of the record to the 


appellant. 


The severed paragraph contained infor- 
mation of the doctor, and not the appel- 
lant. The Act does not provide an abso- 
lute exemption for the release of personal 
information to someone other than the 
individual to whom the information re- 
lates. Rather, it permits disclosure if 
doing so would not constitute an unjus- 
tified invasion of the individual’s per- 
sonal privacy. The information could 
not be accurately characterized as highly 
sensitive. Although the letter itself may 
have been submitted with an expectation 
of confidentiality, it was disclosed to the 
appellant. This was done because the 
contents of the severed paragraph were 
not, in and of themselves, the type of 
information which would have been pro- 
vided in confidence. Therefore, disclo- 
sure of the severed paragraph would not 
constitute an unjustified invasion of the 
personal privacy of the doctor.

and (b), and 18(d), (e) and (g) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


The appeal of the head’s decision was 
filed 32 days, as opposed to 30 days, after 
the decision was made by the institution. 
No evidence of prejudice was submitted 
by the institution or the affected parties, 
and the Assistant Commissioner found 
that he had jurisdiction to review the 
head’s decision. 

Certain records. and information 
severed from records was found to be 
outside of the scope of the appellant’s 
request, and the institution and the 
affected parties abandoned their exemp- 
tion claims to three of the records. 

None of the records which the institu- 
tion claimed were exempt under section 
12(1) were actually submitted to Cabi- 
net. However, five of the seven records 
for which section 12(1) was claimed 
would reveal the substance of delibera- 
tions of Cabinet, and were therefore 
properly exempt. 

The one record for which section 
12(1)(a) was claimed consisted of min- 
utes of a Cabinet meeting, and was 
therefore exempt. 

There was no evidence to indicate that 
release of the information would preju- 
dice relations between the institution 
andanother government or governments, 
and the requirements of section 15(a) 
were notsatisfied. There was no evidence 
to indicate that the information con- 
tained in the records was received in 
confidence from another government, 
and the requirements of section 15(b) 
were not satisfied. 


Because negotiations concerning the ~ 


takeover had been completed, section 
18(1)(e) did not apply. The institution 


did not provide sufficient evidence to 
substantiate its claim that harm could 
reasonably be expected to result if the 
information were disclosed, and the re- 
quirements of section 18(1)(d) and (g) 
were not satisfied. The type of potential 
harm referred to by the institution was in 
regard to the position of the affected 
parties, and was properly addressed un- 
der section 17. 

The information contained in the 
records for which the affected party had 
raised the application of section 17 quali- 
fied as “commercial information” for the 
purposes of section 17(1). The informa- 
tion was supplied in confidence implic- 
itly. Detailed and convincing evidence 
of potential harm to the affected party’s 
competitive position and undue loss or 
gain that would result from disclosure of 
portions of some of the records was pro- 
vided, and only those portions qualified 
for exemption under section 17. 

The Information and Privacy Com- 
missioner or his delegate does not have 
the power to make an order pursuant to 
section 11 of the Act. 

There was no compelling public in- 
terest in the disclosure of the portions of 
the records found exempt under section 
17 which clearly outweighed the purpose 
of the section 17 exemption.

The appellant requested access to all 
documents relevant to the Health Disci- 
plines Board investigations of two named 
physicians which were conducted in re- 
sponse to complaints made by the appel- 
lant about medical treatment given to his 
father, who is now deceased. The appel- 
lant did not provide documentation 
which would demonstrate that he had 
been officially appointed as his father’s 
personal representative, or confirm that 
he was seeking the information in rela- 
tion to the administration of his father’s 
estate. 

The institution granted partial access 
to the records, denying access to others, 
in whole or in part, pursuant to section 
21 of the Act. The institution identified 
portions of the records which contained 
theappellant’s personal information, and 
were taken to have intended to exempt 
these portions from disclosure pursuant 


to section 49(b) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


The appellant did not provide sufficient 
evidence to demonstrate that he was his 
father’s personal representative for the 
purposes of the Act. Accordingly, the 
appellant’s request for information, as it 
related to his father’s personal informa- 
tion, was subject to the mandatory provi- 
sions of section 21 of the Act. 

Portions of the record contained the 
personal information of the appellant 
and other individuals. The remaining 
records contained the personal informa- 
tion of individuals other than the appel- 
lant. 

Allegations about physicians which 
were made by the appellant in one record

could not be considered highly sensitive 
(s.21(2)(f)]. The institution did not 
provide any evidence to support its claim 
that the information was supplied in 
confidence [s.21(2)(h)], or that its disclo- 
sure could unfairly damage the reputa- 
tion of any person referred to in the 
record [s. 21(2)(i)]. Disclosure of this 
record, therefore, would not constitute 
an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy under section 49(b). 

A letter in which concern was ex- 
pressed that information submitted be 
kept confidential, with no indication 
that the letter itself be kept confidential 
does not satisfy the requirements of sec- 
tion 21(2)(h), and disclosure would not 
constitute an unjustified invasion of 
privacy under section 49(b). 

Records which related to the medical 
history, diagnosis, condition and treat- 
ment of the appellant’s father satisfied 
the requirements of a presumed unjusti- 
fied invasion of personal privacy under 
section 21(3)(a). Evidence to establish 
the relevance of factors listed under sec- 
tion 21(2) was not provided, and disclo- 
sure of these records was found to consti- 
tute an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy under section 21. 

Disclosure of the birth dates of the 
physicians was found to constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
under section 21. 

Sufficient evidence to establish that 
disclosure of the remainder of the records 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy under section 21 was 
not provided for the remaining records.

An individual requested access to a copy 
of all correspondence passing between 
the appellant, a named individual and 
the Ministry of Housing during the pe- 
riod of February 1989 to present. 

The institution provided access to 
some records and, after receiving repre- 
sentations regarding the disclosure of 
other records, informed the appellant 
that it intended to disclose the other 
records to the requester as well. 

The appellant appealed the institu- 
tion’s decision to disclose the records 
about which he had been notified. The 
appellant also appealed the institution’s 
failure to notify him prior to disclosing 
other records. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The appellant’s right to appeal a head’s 
decision, under section 50(1) of the Act, 
extends to those affected persons who 
have been given notice ofa request under 
section 28(1) of the Act. Because the 
appellant was not given notice with re- 
spect to the request for the records that 
were disclosed to the requester, the 
Assistant Commissioner found that he 
did not have jurisdiction to review the 
institution’s decision not to notify the 
appellant under section 28. 


The records contained recorded in- 
formation about a commercial dwelling 
and the Building Code Act, not recorded 
information about any identifiable indi- 
vidual. The views and opinions ex- 
pressed in the records are recorded on 
business letterhead and were sent to the 
institution in support ofa hearing before 
the Building Code Commission. They 
did not contain views or opinions of 
another individual about another indi- 
vidual, and were not of a private, confi- 
dential, or personal nature. Therefore, 
the records did not qualify as personal 
information as defined in section 2(1) of 
the Act. 

All except one of the records con- 
tained technical and/or financial infor- 
mation. Because of the context in which 
the records were submitted and the de- 
tailed submissions made by the appellant 
with respect to his expectations of confi- 
dentiality, the Assistant Commissioner 
was prepared to assume that the records 
were supplied to the institution in confi- 
dence implicitly. 

One of the types of harm identified 
by the appellant related to harm to the 
position of the institution, which is not 
one of the types of harm contemplated 
by section 17. Potential harm to the 
institution’s interest is addressed by sec- 
tion 18 of the Act, which was not claimed 
by the institution. Disclosure of the 
record could not reasonably be expected 
to prevent similar information from be- 
ing supplied to the institution. A party 
who feels that it is in his/her interest to 
apply for a hearing before the Building 
Code Commission will do so, whether or 
not this information is disclosed.

The appellant requested access to a copy 
of an Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) 
report relating to an incident at an OPP 
detachment. 

The institution denied access to the 
record under section 14(2)(a) of the Act. 
During the course of the inquiry, the 
institution withdrew its exemption claim 
under section 14(2)(d), and granted par- 
tial access to the record, with severances 
pursuant to section 21. The appellant 
indicated that he was not interested in 
the personal information of individu- 
als other than his client, but felt that 
much more had been deleted from the 
document than was reasonably necessary 
to protect the identity of other persons.

The appellant requested access to letters 
of complaint received by the institution 
about the appellant in his capacity as an 
employee of the institution. 

The institution denied access to the 
records under section 21 of the Act. 
During the course of mediation, the 
institution clarified that it was relying on 
section 49(b) rather than section 21 as 
the basis for denying access. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The recordsare letters written by inmates 
which outline incidents involving them- 
selves, two other individuals and the 
appellant. The records contained the 
personal information of the appellant, 
the authors of the letters, and the two 
other individuals. 

The records did not contain any of the 
types of information listed in section 
21(3), therefore did not satisfy the re- 
quirements for a presumed unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy. The infor- 
mation contained in the records could be 
characterized as highly sensitive [section 
21(2)(f)]. The manner in which the 
records were submitted to and received 
by the institution could lead to a reason- 
able expectation that they would be 
treated confidentially [section 21(2)(h)]. 
As these two factors weighed in favour of 
a finding that disclosure of the records 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 


of personal privacy, all three records quali- 
fied for exemption under section 49(b).

General, Civil Law Division for the pe-

sent by the institution did not comply 
with section 29(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.

did not qualify for exemption under 
section 13. Because the portion of the 
record which qualified for exemption 
under section 13 consisted of the appel- 
lant’s personal information, the section 
49(a) exemption was available, and was 
upheld. 

The institution’s notice of refusal let-

ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


The records for which the head had 
claimed section 12 did not qualify for 
exemption as the matter did not relate to 
the making of government decisions or 
the formulation of government policy. 
Rather, the matter related to a govern- 
ment policy that had already been for- 
mulated and implemented. 

Factual background information did 
not include a suggested course of action, 
and was not “advice” for the purposes of 
the Act, and did not qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 13. The specific 
recommendations of an employee was 
“advice”, and qualified for exemption 
under section 13 of the Act. 

A record dealing with regulatory is- 
sues of mutual interest to the provinces’ 
Superintendents of Insurance, which was 
received by the institution in confidence, 
qualified for exemption under section 
15(b) of the Act. 

Records prepared by or for Crown 
counsel for use in giving legal advice or at 
a time when litigation was either con- 
templated or actually in progress quali- 
fied for exemption under section 19 of 
the Act. 

Reports prepared during the course of 
investigations conducted by the Minis- 
try of Consumer and Commercial Rela- 
tions under the /ysurance Act qualified 
for exemption under section 14(2)(a) of 
the Act. Records which were observa- 
tions or recordings of fact or were not 
prepared as part ofan actual investigation 
did not qualify for exemption under 
section 14(2)(a). 

Investigations or inspections con- 
ducted by the institution under the /n- 
surance Act qualified as “law enforce- 
ment” under the Act. Letters which were 
sent to the institution from and tran- 
scriptions of telephone conversations with 


12 


various sources who provided informa- 
tion during the prosecution of the appel- 
lant’s automobile club would “disclose 
the identity of a confidential source” 
[s.14(1)(d)] and qualified for exemption. 

Personal information of individuals 
other than the appellant were compiled 
and identifiable as part of an investiga- 
tion into a possible violation of law, and 
met the requirements for a presumed 
unjustified invasion of privacy contained 
in section 21(3)(b). The personal infor- 
mation severed from the records was not 
sufficiently relevant to the appellant’s 
rights to rebut the presumption con- 
tained in section 21(3)(b).

The appellant requested access to an 
engineering report which described the 
condition of an underground garage. 
The institution denied access to the 
records pursuant to sections 8(1)(a) and 
8(1)(b) of the Act. During the course of 
mediation of the appeal, sections 
10(1)(a),(b) and (c) were also relied on to 
exempt the information. The affected 
party raised the application of section 12. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the record to the appellant. 


The institution’s process of by-law en- 
forcement involved investigations or in- 
spections that could lead to proceedings 
in acourt of law where penalties could be 
imposed, and therefore qualified as law 
enforcement under the Act. The institu- 
tion claimed that disclosure of the record 
to the appellant could provide him with 
an opportunity to contradict the reports, 
question their validity and generally in- 
terfere with the law enforcement pro- 
ceedings although he is not a party to 
them. The purposes of the Act, however, 
indicate that such scrutiny by the public 
must beaccommodated. The institution 
did not provide sufficient evidence to 
establish that interference with a law 
enforcement matter could reasonably be 


expected to result from disclosure of the 
record, and sections 8(1)(a) and (b) did 
not apply. 

The information contained in the 
record could be considered to be techni- 
cal information. The affected party’s 
concerns about the effect of disclosure on 
it’s competitive position were specula- 
tive. In the absence of detailed and 
convincing evidence, the affected party’s 
statement that disclosure could reason- 
ably be expected to interfere significantly 
with contractual or other negotiations 
referred to by the owner was not ac- 
cepted. Because the institution appeared 
to have the authority to inspect proper- 
ties and have reports such as those at issue 
produced, the affected party’s statement 
that it should reasonably be expected that 
similar information would no longer be 
supplied was not accepted. Accordingly, 


~ sections 10(1)(a), (b) and (c) did not 


apply. 

The application of section 12 was 
raised by the affected party. Because the 
section was not relied on by the institu- 
tion, and the actions of the institution 
were not clearly inconsistent with the 
application of a mandatory exemption 
provided by the Act, the application of 


section 12 was not considered.

A request for access to personal informa- 
tion was received by the Regional Mu- 
nicipality of Ottawa-Carleton. The re- 
quest was forwarded to the Ottawa- 
Carleton Regional Transit Commission 
(OC Transpo). OC Transpo operates as 
a regional transit commission in the Ot- 
tawa-Carleton Regional Area, but a small 
number of its regular bus routes cross the 
provincial border from Ottawa, into Hull, 
Quebec. 

OC Transpo advised the requester 
that the Act did not apply to it, but that 
access was granted to some of the infor- 
mation under its Freedom of Informa- 


14 


tion and Protection of Privacy Policy. 
The requester appealed the OC 

Transpo’s decision to deny access to part 

of the information and its decision that 


the Act did not apply to OC Transpo. 


ORDER 
The head was ordered to make a decision 
regarding access to the records under the 


Act. 


Because the bus routes which cross the 
Ontario border into Quebec are an inte- 
gral part of the transit commission’s regu- 
lar operations, OC Transpo is a federal 
undertaking under sections 92.10 and 
91.29 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Pro- 
vincial laws of general application apply 
to federal undertakings where the laws do 
not sterilize or mutilate, or affect a vital 
part of the management and operation of 
the federal undertaking. The Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act is a provincial law of general 
application which does not affect OC 
Transpo in its specifically federal aspect. 
The specifically federal aspect of OC 
Transpo is the operation of an 
interprovincial bus service. The Act af- 
fects OC Transpo in a secondary aspect 
ofits operation. OC Transpo isa “transit 
commission” and accordingly falls within 
the definition of “institution” under sec- 
tion 2(1) of the Act. Therefore, the Act 
applies to it. Records, the disclosure of 
which would clearly affect labour rela- 
tions, working conditions or a vital part 
of the managementand operation of OC 
Transpo as a federal undertaking do not 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Act. The 
requested records do not fall within the 
area of working conditions or labour 
relations, nor would their disclosure af- 
fect a vital part of the management and 
operation of the institution, accordingly 
they fall within the jurisdiction of the Act.

The appellant requested access to copies » 
of work orders issued by the municipality 
against residential rental properties since 
January 1, 1990. 

The institution granted partial access 
to the work orders that had been com- 
plied with, severing personal informa- 
tion under section 14 of the Act. The 
institution denied access to the work 
orders that have not been complied with, 
pursuant to section 8(1)(f) of the Act. 

During the course of mediation, the 
appellant indicated that he was not re- 
questing the names and addresses of the 
owners of the properties. 


ORDER 

The institution was ordered to disclose 
the records to the appellant, with the 
names and addresses of the owners sev- 
ered. 


The municipal address of the properties 
did not constitute personal information 
under the Act, as it is information about 
a property, not about an identifiable 
individual. Accordingly, section 14 did 
not apply to the property addresses. 

In those cases where compliance with 
the work order had occurred, it could not 
be said that section 8(1)(f) was relevant, 
as no trial or adjudication will occur. 
Where compliance with the work order 
had not occurred, the representations 
made by the institution in support of the 
application of section 8(1)(f) totherecords 
which have not resulted in court pro- 
ceedings were found to be at best specu-

lative, and section 8(1)(f) was not appli- 
cable. With regard to the one record 
where charges had been laid against a 
property owner, the institution’s repre- 
sentations did not persuade the Com- 
missioner to find that disclosure of the 
record could reasonably be expected to 
deprive a person of the right to a fair trial

against residential rental properties since 
January 1, 1990. 

The institution denied access to the 
records, pursuant to sections 8(1)(a), 
8(2)(a), and 14 of the Acz. 

During the course of mediation, the 
appellant indicated that he was not re- 
questing the names and addresses of the 
owners of the properties. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the records to the appellant, with the 
names and addresses of the owners sev- 
ered. 


The municipal address of the properties 
did not constitute personal information 
under the Acz, as it is information about 
a property, not about an identifiable 
individual. Accordingly, section 14 did 


not apply to the property addresses. 

The institution’s process of by-law 
enforcement involved investigations or 
inspections which could lead to pro- 
ceedings ina court where penalties could 
be imposed and, therefore, qualified as 
“law enforcement” under the Acz. 

In considering the Orders to Comply 
issued by the institution the Commis- 
sioner was of the view that they do not 
consist of formal statements or accounts 
of results from a collation or considera- 
tion of information, but rather are noti- 
fications of repairs to be effected, and so 
do not qualify as reports. Therefore, 
section 8(2)(a) did not apply to the 
records. 

All of the work orders had been com- 
plied with, therefore no question of 
interference can arise, and section 8(1)(a) 
did not apply to the records.

The same considerations that were ad-

process of by-law enforcement qualified 
as “law enforcement” under the Acs a 
“reasonable expectation of confidential- 
ity” was found within the institution’s 
process of by-law enforcement; and dis- 
closure of the record would disclose the 
identity of a confidential source of infor-

any circumstances or raise any argument 
which would distinguish this appeal from

therefore, the information was found to

The appellant requested access to the 
actual salaries or salary ranges for the 
institution’s Director, Executive As- 
sistant and Superintendents. 

The institution disclosed salary ranges 
which existed for two of the positions to 
the appellant, and denied access to the 
actual salaries of the employees in posi- 
tions forwhich salary ranges did notexist, 
pursuant to section 14 of the Act. 


ORDER 

The institution was ordered to prepare a 
salary range for the positions for which 
salary ranges did not exist and to disclose 
the salary ranges to the appellant. 


There was no dispute among the parties 
that the information requested qualified 
as “personal information”, and the Com- 
missioner agreed. 

Disclosure of the salary for a specific 
position for which there is one incum- 
bent would describe an individual’s in- 
come as set out in section 14(3)(f) of the 
Act and would, therefore, constitute a 
presumed unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy. The presumed unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy was not re- 
butted by section 14(4)(a) or byacombi- 


nation of the factors listed in section 
14(2). 

The Commissioner recognized that 
current economicenvironment places an 
even greater value on the prudent use of 
public funds, that operations of public 
institution should be open to public scru- 
tiny, and that the public has a right to 
know how public funds are being spent. 
However, the Commissioner was not 
convinced that a compelling public in- 
terest in the disclosure of the exact salaries 
existed, such as to outweigh the purpose 
of the section 14 exemption. 

Section 14(4)(a) itself incorporates 
the public interest as it permits members 
of the publicto obtain information about 
the salaries of public employees. The 
public interest as reflected in section 
14(4)(a) of the Actis such that, although 
the exact salaries should not be disclosed, 
salary ranges should be.

Thecomplainant’s personal information

CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the institution 
had taken reasonable steps to ensure that

found that most of the information con-

was accurate and up to date since it had 
been submitted directly by the com-

there was no reason to question the accu-

it had used the complainant’s personal

KEYWORDS

An individual complained about the dis- 
closure of his personal information by 


the Workers’ Compensation Board. 
The IPC determined that: 


* all five letters which the complainant 
had submitted in support of his com- 
plaint, contained his personal informa- 
tion relating to his WCB claim; one 
included the decision of the Decision 
Review Specialist; 

¢ four of the letters had been sent either 
directly to or had been copied to, the 
centre where the complainant resided; 

* the centre was the “employer of record” 
for the claim. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the personal 
information at issue had been disclosed 
by the WCB to the employer for a con- 
sistent purpose and one which could 
have reasonably been expected under the 
circumstances. Further, there had been a 
requirement under section 72(2) of the 
Workers’ Compensation Act for the WCB 
to communicate promptly and in wri- 
ting, the decision of the Decision Review 
Specialist to both the complainant and 
the employer.

The complainant worked as a driver. 

The Ministry explained that the com- 
plainant’s driving record had been dis- 
closed as a result of an oversight, arising 
out of a “computer bug” which some- 
times occurs in high volume systems (like 
the one which provides driver informa- 
tion to insurance companies). In re- 
sponse to the complaint, the Ministry 
provided a written letter ofapology to the 
complainant. 

Upon receiving the Ministry’s apol- 
ogy, the individual withdrew his com-

An individual complained that an officer 
of the institution’s area office had im- 
properly disclosed to her employer a 


telephone call that she had made to the 
institution, in the capacity of an “inter- 
ested citizen”. 

The IPC determined that the officer 
had asked the complainant to identify 
herself but had not recorded the name 
because she had forgotten it. The officer 
had later confirmed the complainant’s 
name when she was asked by the em- 
ployer if the complainant had made the 
call. 


CONCLUSION 
The IPC concluded that the information 
disclosed could not be considered “re- 
corded information aboutan identifiable 
individual” and, therefore, was not “per- 
sonal information” as defined by the Act. 
Nevertheless, we were of the view that 
the officer had intended to record the 
complainant’s name for the purpose of 
disclosing it to the employer. The infor- 
mation disclosed would have then been 
“personal information” and its disclosure 
would have been contrary to the Act. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 

The IPC recommended that the institu- 
tion’s area office review the manner in 
which its staff handled inquiries from 


the public, in light of the requirements of 
the Act.

Anindividual complained that her medi-

CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the institution had 
disclosed the complainant’s personal in- 
formation, contrary to the provisions of 
the Act. 

This was acknowledged by the insti- 
tution. 

During the course of the investiga-

her primary concern was that the inves- 
tigative report containing her medical 
information could have an adverse effect 
on her career and job prospects within 
the institution. ; 

We informed the institution of this 
concern. As a result, a letter from the 
institution was sent to the complainant 
apologizing for the improper disclosure 
of her personal information, and advi- 
sing that steps were being taken to ensure 
that this would not happen again. 

The complainant was given assu- 
rances that the investigative report would 
not form part of her personnel file and 
that no record of the report would be 
kept in her file.

An individual complained that the City 
was collecting and using social insurance

CONCLUSION 
The IPC determined that: 


¢ The information in question was “per-

2(1) of the Act. 

¢ The personal information was “col- 
lected” by the institution. 

¢ The collection of the SIN for the pur- 
pose of taxicab driver licensing adminis- 
tration contravenes section 28(2) of the 
Act. 

¢ Proper notice of the collection of per- 
sonal information was not given in ac- 
cordance with the Act. 

¢ The use of the SIN on taxicab driver 
licences and file labels was not in accord- 
ance with section 31 of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 
With respect to SIN, the IPC recom- 


mended that the institution: 


¢ Discontinue the collection of SIN for 
the purpose of taxicab driver licensing 
administration. 


¢ Discontinue all uses of the SIN. 


¢ Within the next 12 months, remove the 
SIN from all file labels appearing on

institution: 


¢ Revise the Application form to include

An employee of the institution com- 
plained that the institution had im- 
properly collected personal information 
through psychological tests that some 
employees were required to take. These 
tests were externally administered by an 
office services agency on behalf of the 


institution. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the collection 
was in accordance with the Act, as the 
testing of employees was considered by 
the institution to be necessary to the 
proper administration of a lawfully au- 
thorized activity involving employment 
screening practices. However, the IPC 
determined that proper notice had not 
been given, and that adequate measures 
had not been taken to protect the confi- 
dentiality of candidates’ personal infor- 
mation in the care of the office services 
agency. It was also determined that em- 
ployees should be given access to their 
own answers to the test. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 
The IPC recommended that: 


¢ Employees who are required to take 
psychological tests should be given a 
printout of their answers to the questions 
they responded to. 

¢ Proper notice must be given to all 
employees, pursuant to section 29(2) of 
the Act. 

¢ The institution should ensure, by way 
of a written contract with the agency, 
that provisions to protect the privacy of 
personal information be developed and 
followed. The IPC provided the institu- 
tion with a number of specific require- 
ments to be included in such a contract.

plained that the institution was collec- 
ting employees’ personal information by 
requiring them to submit their expense 
claims for prescribed medications to the 
institution prior to being reimbursed

CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the information 
in question was personal information, 
and that the institution had no authority 
to collect the personal information, as 
employees could submit their expense 
claims directly to the insuring agent. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 

1. The institution should notify the in- 
suring agent to accept, effective immedi- 
ately, any insurance claims sent directly 
to them from employees of the institu- 
tion. The insuring agent should also be 
advised that all such information must be 
kept strictly confidential and not dis- 
closed to the institution. The IPC should 
be advised of this notification immedi- 
ately. 

2. The institution should change its pro- 
cedures to enable its employees to submit 
insurance claims directly to the insuring 
agent. 

3. The institution should cease the col- 
lection ofall personal information rela- 
ting to the medical, dental and vision

4. The institution should destroy all col- 
lected insurance claims records in its 
custody and notify affected employees

The complainant stated that his privacy 
had been breached when a noise study,

CONCLUSION

January 1, 1991, this disclosure predated 
the Act, and therefore fell outside of the

meeting. A local newspaper subsequently 
reported the matter in one ofits columns. 


CONCLUSION 

TheIPC considered all the circumstances 
of the case and the interests of all parties 
involved. It was decided that the incident 
required no further investigation. Con- 
tact was, however, made with the institu- 
tion, which was asked to ensure that its 
officials and staff be made aware of the 


privacy requirements of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The institution was advised to ensure 
that its elected officials and staff be fully 
apprised of the privacy provisions of the 
Act.

An individual complained that the in- 
stitution disclosed his personal in- 
formation when it posted two notices 
containing his tax arrears information. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the tax arrears 
information related to a property, and 
not to an identifiable individual. There- 
fore, it was not personal information as 
defined by section 2(1) of the Act. Thus, 
Part I of the Act did not apply, and the 
institution disclosed the information in 
accordance with the Act.

Theappellant requested access to records 
related to the alleged connection of three 
settling pits toa municipal sewer system. 


The head advised the appellant that a 
videotape did not exist, granted access to 
photographs, and partial access to two 
occurrence reports. The head denied 
access to three other occurrence reports 
and severed portions of a witness state- 
mentundersections 14(1)(a), (b) and (f) 
and 21 of the Act. During the course of 
the inquiry, the institution withdrew its 
application of sections 14(1)(b) and 21. 


ORDER : 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


Prosecutions under particular sections 
of the Environmental Protection Actand 
the Ontario Water Resources Act quality 
as “law enforcement matters” for the 
purposes of section 14(1)(a) of the Act. 
The information contained in the records 
represented the anticipated evidence of 
subpoenaed witnesses, and premature 
disclosure of the records could reason- 
ably be expected to interfere with a law 
enforcement matter [section 14(1)(a)].

section 21 of the Act. 


The requester had filed two requests for 
the same information. Because the re- 
quests were identical, the head did not 
consider the second request to bea new 
request, and counted the time for filing 
an appeal 30 days from the date of 
response to the first request. Asa result, 
the head challenged the Commission- 
er’s authority to hear the appeal. 


ORDER 

The head was ordered not to disclose the 
names contained in the record, and the 
head’s decision not to disclose the ad- 
dresses was upheld. 


By its course of conduct, the institution 
was found to have treated the appellant's 
second request as a new request and 
therefore the institution’s second letter 
was the decision at issue, notwithstand- 
ing that it reiterated a position taken at 
an earlier date. The appeal was filed 
within 30 days of the second letter, and 
the Assistant Commissioner therefore 
had the authority to review the decision 


of the head. 


The names of the apprentices had not 
been disclosed despite the head’s deci- 
sion to do so, because the appellant had 
not paid the fee deposit requested by the 
head. Because the personal information 
exemption [section 21] is mandatory 
and the Actrequires the Commissioner 
to review all portions of the head’s deci- 
sion, the Assistant Commissioner also 
reviewed the head’s decision to disclose 
the names. 


Thenamesand addresses qualified as the 
personal information of the apprentices. 
Cosmetic care of the human body, and 
marketing activity were found not to be 
relevant considerations. The names and 
addresses were provided to the institu- 
tion implicitly in confidence [section 


21(2)(h)], and disclosure of the names 
and addresses and names alone would 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy.

Theappellant requested access to wiretap

institution refused to confirm or deny 
the existence of responsive records under 
section 14(3) of the Act. In Interim 
Order P-262, the Assistant Commis-

vided with insufficient information to 
determine whether the head had prop- 
erly exercised his discretion under sec-

head to reconsider the exercise of discre-

Additional representations were pro- 
vided by the institution, and the Assist-

fere with the exercise of discretion in

The appellant requested continuing 
access to a list of the names, dates of 
birth and addresses of all babies born 
in Ontario in 1991. The institution 
denied access to the responsive records 
under section 21 of the Act. 


During mediation, the appellant nar- 
rowed the time frame of his request to 
the period of January 1 to January 17, 
1991: 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The records contained the personal 
information of both the babies and 
the mothers. The name, address and 
date of birth of an individual do not 
relate to that individual’s medical his- 
tory [section 21(3)(a)]. The promo- 
tion of informed choice in the pur- 
chase of goods and services [section 
21(2)(c)] is not intended to be rel- 
evant to the provision of mailing lists 
for marketing purposes. Unfair expo- 
sure to pecuniary or other harm [sec- 
tion 21(2)(e)] and high sensitivity [sec- 
tion 21(2)(f)] were also not relevant 
considerations. Individuals register- 
ing the information would reasonably 
expect that the information would 
remain confidential [section 21(2)(h)], 
and therefore disclosure of the infor- 
mation was found to constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy.

The appellant requested access to a copy

all documentation of allegations made 


against him relating toan employment 
matter. 


The institution granted access to his per- 
sonnel and payroll records. The institu- 
tion denied access to the records relating 
to the allegations made against him un- 
der sections 14(1)(b) and (e), 14(2)(c), 
20, 21 and 49(b) of the Acz. 


The institution withdrew its claims un- 
der sections 14(1)(b) and (e) and 14(2)(c) 
during the inquiry. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


The records contained the personal in- 
formation of the appellant, and of the 
appellant and other individuals. 


While some of the information con- 
tained in the records may be disturbing 
to some individuals, the institution did 
not provide sufficient evidence to estab- 
lish that disclosure of the information to 
the appellant could reasonably be ex- 
pected to seriously threaten the safety or 
health of any person [section 20]. 


Evidence which would establish that the 
records were compiled and were identifi- 
able as part of an investigation by the 
Ontario Provincial Police intoa possible 
violation of law [section 21(3)(b)] was 
not provided. Theinformation could be 
characterized as highly sensitive [section 
21(2)(f)], some of the information had 
been provided in confidence [section

The institution initially refused to con-

sive records, citing section 14(3), 21(5) 
and 49(a) of the Act. During the inquiry, 
the institution withdrew its claims under 
sections 14(3) and 21(5) and granted 
partial access to the one responsive record. 
Access to the remainder of the record was 
denied under sections 14(1)(g), 14(2)(a), 
15(b) and 21 of the Acz. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The parts of the record withheld from the 
appellant contained personal informa- 
tion of individuals other than the appel- 
lant, except for one sentence which con- 
tains the personal information of the 
appellant. 


The record was a formal statement or 
account of the results of Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police inquiries and/or corpo-

and companies, which was prepared in 
the course of law enforcement by an 
agency which has the function of enforc-

14(2)(a)].. The portion of the record 
which contained the personal informa-

The head was ordered to disclose the

personal information contained in two 
documents entitled “Employee Separa- 
tion/Work Performance Records”. The 
request related specifically to the infor- 
mation contained under the headings 
“Reason for Separation”, “Quality of 
Work”, “Attendance and Punctuality”, 
and “W/ould you re-hire this employee”. 


The institution denied the request for 
correction and invited the appellant to 
submita statement of disagreement to be 
attached to the two records and to have 
the statement of disagreement forwarded 
to any person or agencies to whom the 
personal information was disclosed dur- 
ing the previous year. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld.

AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/

The information contained in the record 
qualified as the personal information of 
the appellant, however, the correction 
requested could only be accurately de- 
scribed as a substitution of opinion. The 
records accurately set out the views of the 
appellant’s former supervisors.

The appellant requested access to spe- 
cific documents related to his Ontario 
Human Rights Commission complaint. 


The institution provided partial access to 
the records. Following mediation and 
inquiry, the institution was relying on 
exemptions under sections 14(1)(c), 21, 


49(a) and (b) of the Act to withhold the 


remaining records or parts of records. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The information contained in nine of the 
records or parts of records qualified as the 
personal information of the appellant 
and other individuals, and information 
contained in five records or parts of records 
qualified as the personal information of 
other individuals only. 


The records or parts of records were 
compiled and were part of an investiga- 


tion into a possible violation of law, 
and satisfied the requirements for a 
presumed unjustified invasion of pri- 
vacy [21(3)(b)]. The appellant did 
not establish that the personal infor- 
mation was relevant to a fair determi- 
nation of his rights [21(2)(d)], and the 
personal information was properly ex- 
empt under section 21 orsection 49(b).

Theappellant requested access to specific 
types of records related to two mortgage 
brokerage firms which had experienced 
financial difficulties and were placed in 
receivership by court appointment. 


The institution provided access to three 
records, but denied access to all other 
records pursuant to sections 12(1)(e), 
14(2)(a), 17(1)(b) and 21 of the Act. 
During the course of the inquiry, sec- 
tions 12(1);- 12(1)(b);° 121) (c)’ and 
14(1)(d) were raised by the institution as 
exemption claims. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


In light of one of the affected party’s 
willingness to disclose his identity, he 
was not considered a confidential source 


of information [14(1)(d)}. 


Six of the records were reports prepared 
in the course of law enforcement investi- 
gations and/or inspections by an agency 
which has the function of enforcing com- 
pliance with a law [14(2)(a)]. However, 
four of these records were prepared in the 
course of routine inspections by an agency 
which is authorized to enforce and regu- 
late compliance with a particular statute 
of Ontario, and did not qualify for ex- 
emption [14(4)]. 


Because the affected party to which three 
of the records related was not resisting 
disclosure of the three records, section 17 
did not apply to them. Four of the 
records contained information which had 
been the subject of public debate, and 
were provided pursuant to a statutory 
obligation. Therefore, disclosure could 
not significantly prejudice the competi- 
tive position of the firms [17(1)(a)] or 
result in similar information no longer 


being supplied [17(1)(b)]. 


The institution did not provide evidence 
to indicate that the matters had been 
considered by the Cabinet following the 
date of the decisions made by the Man- 
agement Board of Cabinet or that the 
matters were to be addressed by the 
Executive Council or one of its Commit- 
tees in the future and, therefore, sections 


12(1)(©) and (e) did not apply. 


Five of the records did not contain any 
specific policy options or recommenda- 
tions and did not, therefore, qualify for 
exemption under section 12(1)(b). 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Two of the records described the state of 
affairs with respect to the firms without 
referring to any involvement on the part 
of Cabinet or seeking any decision on the 
part of Cabinet and, therefore, did not 
qualify for exemption under section 
12(1). 


One of the affected parties consented to 
the disclosure of three of the records, and 
their disclosure, therefore, was not pro- 
hibited by section 21. Information re- 
lated to the psychiatric history and finan- 
cial activities of most of the individuals 
referred to in the records satisfied the 
requirements for a presumed unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy [sections 


21(3)(a) and (£)]. 


Information which appeared to describe 
the finances, assets, liabilities, financial 
history and/or activities of two of the 
affected parties had been the subject of 
extensive publicity as well as discussion 
during the course of several criminal and 
civil court proceedings, and was not con- 
sidered to be an unjustified invasion of 
personal privacy.

The appellant requested access to specific

in the Ontario Formulary. 


The institution provided access to six of 
88 responsive records. Access was denied

During the course of the inquiry, the 
institution disclosed 19 of the records 
and raised the application of section 17. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was upheld. 


The institution’s decision letter did not 
provide the appellant with a description 
of each record, and did not satisfy the 
requirements of section 29(1)(b). Be- 
cause a more detailed description of the 
records was created by the Appeals Of-

The investigative processes under the 
Ontario Drug Benefits Act and the Pre- 
scription Drug Cost Regulation Act satis- 
fied the requirements of the definition of 
law enforcement, and reports prepared 
in the course of such investigations quali- 
fied for exemption undersection 14(2)(a). 


The disclosure of records which contain 
strategies, procedures and specific drug 
industry investigation targets as well as 
other courses of action would have re- 
vealed techniques or procedures currently 
in use or likely to be used in law enforce- 
ment and qualified for exemption under 
section 14(1)(c).

plaints of individuals who supplied the 
institution with this type of information 
in confidence qualified for exemption 
under section 14(1)(d).

The appellant requested access to records 
relating to him, including notes of his 
supervisor taken in the context of an 
allegation made against him by another 
employee. 


The institution denied access to the 
records pursuant to section 49(b) of the 
Act. During the course of the appeal, the 
appellant narrowed the scope of his re- 
quest to the notes taken by his supervisor, 
excluding the personal information of 
individuals other than himself. The in- 
stitution denied access to the records, 
adding sections 14(1)(f) and 19 of the Act 


as exemption claims. 


ORDER 

The head was ordered to disclose the 
record to the appellant, subject to the 
severance of personal information of in- 


dividuals other than the appellant. 


The record was created by the supervisor 
during the course of her employment, 
and described events which took place at 
the workplace in the context of providing 
supervision to the appellant. As such, the 
record was properly considered to be in 
the custody and/or under the control of 
the institution pursuant to section 10(1) 


of the Act. 


The supervisor was acting in her profes- 
sional capacity as an employee of the 
institution and the appellant’s supervisor 


when the record was created, and the 
record could not, therefore, properly be 
categorized as “personal information” of 
the supervisor under section 2(1) of the 
Act. The record contained the personal 
information of the appellant only. 


The institution did not provideadequate 
evidence to establish that the supervisor’s 
right to impartial adjudication during 
the grievance proceeding would be com- 
promised as a result of disclosure of the 
record and, therefore, the record was not 
exempt under section 14(1)(f) of the Act. 


The record was not a communication 
between a client and a legal advisor, and 
evidence to support that the record was 
directly related to seeking, formulating 
or giving legal advice was not presented 
by the institution. The institution failed 
to establish that the record was prepared 
especially for a lawyer's brief, and it was 
not prepared by or for Crown counsel. 
Accordingly, the record did not qualify 
for exemption under the section 19 ex- 
emption.

records pursuant to section 17 of the Act. 
During the course of the appeal, the 
representative of the Canadian Cancer 
Society and the National Cancer Insti- 
tute expressed a willingness to disclose 
the records directly to the appellant. The 
institution withdrew its application of 
section 17 and raised section 22(a) as a 
new exemption. 


ORDER 
The head was ordered to disclose the 
record to the appellant. 


Revenue Canada’s Charities Division 
confirmed that the records sought by the 
appellant are not available to the public. 
Anaffected party’s willingness to provide 
the appellant with a copy of the records 
does not render them “currently avail- 
able to the public”. In order fora record 
to qualify for exemption under section 
22(a), it must be published oravailable to 
the public generally, through a regular- 
ised system of access, such as a public 
library or government publications cen- 
tre. The records did not qualify for 
exemption under section 22(a) of the 
Act. 


An institution relying on section 22(a) 
has a duty to inform the requester of the 
specific location of the publicly available 
records, and to ensure that the informa- 
tion is actually available from the alterna- 
tive source.

also requested access to all material

applicants for an interview for this

The institution provided partial access to

ant to sections 13(1) and 21 of the Act. 
During the course of the appeal, the 
appellant narrowed his request such that 
the application of section 13(1) was no 
longer an issue. 


ORDER 

The institution’s decision not to disclose 
the applications and resumes was up- 
held. The institution was ordered to 
disclose the “Qualifying Guide”, with 


the identifying information severed. 


By their very nature, applications and 
resumes qualify as personal information. 
Severance of certain categories of infor- 
mation would not be sufficient to render 
the application or resume no longer relat- 
ing to an identifiable individual. 


Following the severance of identifying 
characteristics from the “Qualifying 
Guide”, the remaining information 


10 


would not meet the requirements of the 
definition of personal information. 


Personal information contained in the 
applications and resumes related to em- 
ployment or educational history, satisfy- 
ing the requirements for a presumed 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
[21(3)(d)]. Disclosure of the personal 
information of the applicants was not 
necessary to subject the activities of the 
Government of Ontario to public scru- 
tiny [21(2)(a)], and the appellant pro- 
vided no evidence to indicate that a legal 
right affecting his interest was at issue, or 
that a proceeding which would deal with 


his rights was existing or contemplated. 


Therefore, the presumption of an unjus- ° 


tified invasion of the personal privacy of 
the applicants in this job competition

certain records as well. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision was partially 


upheld. 


Portions of the records contained the 
personal information of the appellant, of 
other individuals, or of the appellantand 
other individuals. The remaining por- 
tions of the records did not contain per- 
sonal information. 


The records were generated in the course 
of the institution’s investigation ofacom- 
plaint under the Ontario Human Rights 
Code, which is properly considered alaw 
enforcement matter. Because the inves- 
tigation may lead to proceedings beforea 
Board of Inquiry under the Code, it is 
properly considered alaw enforcement 
proceeding. Because the appellant has 
applied for reconsideration of his com- 
plaint, itis not possible to conclude that 
the institution’s investigation has been 
completed until eithera Board of Inquiry 
has been appointed or the reconsidera- 
_ tion process has been completed. The 
portions of the records which could rea- 
sonably be expected to interfere with the 
complaint investigation qualified for ex- 
emption under sections 14(1)(a) and (b). 
The portions of the records which con- 
tained information which related to vari- 
ousadministrative activities in the process- 
ing of the complaintwere not sufficiently 
connected to the actual investigation to 


satisfy the requirement for exemption 
under sections 14(1)(a) or (b). Because 
the institution did not claim any other 
exemptions for the information that was 
found not to qualify for exemption un- 
der section 14(1)(a) or (b), it’s disclosure

The appellant requested access to records 
relating to studies commissioned and

The institution provided the appellant 
with alist ofstudies commissioned by the 
government, including the names of the 
individuals or companies that prepared 
the studies and the dates that the studies 
were commissioned and presented to the 
government. The institution also pro- 
vided the appellant with a bibliography 
outlining the studies being considered by 
the government. The institution denied 
access to copies of the studies pursuant to 
sections 12, 13, 15, 17, 18 and 19 of the 
Act. During the course of the appeal, the 
institution also disclosed a list of the costs 
of the studies, and withdrew claim under 
section 17. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision was upheld. 


One of the records was placed before the 
Cabinet Committee on Automobile In- 
surance and was discussed by that com- 
mittee on two occasions. The substance 
of this document was also considered by 
the Policy and Priorities Board and by 
Cabinet. 


The remaining records were background 
or working papers which were summa- 
rized for consideration by Cabinet. In 
this case, all of the records were incorpo- 
rated into submissions which were made 
to the Cabinet Committee on Automo- 
bile Insurance, the Policy and Priorities 
Board or directly to Cabinet. Because the 
content of the records was used as the 
basis for these submissions, their disclo- 
sure would permit the drawing of accu-

The institution denied access to the

17(1)(d), 20 and 21 of the Act. During 
the processing of the appeal, the appel- 
lant narrowed the scope of his request 
and the institution provided partial ac-

and addresses of the grievers.

The institution’s decision was partially

The Actapplies to records which are in 
the custody or under the control of the 
institution, regardless of whether the 
records originated from the appellant 
and whether or not copies of the records 
were previously provided to the appel- 
lant. 


Home addresses of identifiable indi- 
viduals are personal information of the 
individual. Names which appear in 
records which contain other personal 
information (i.e. home address, the 
fact that an individual has filed a griev- 
ance) are also personal information. 


Addresses of individuals who are/were 
employed in a maximum security divi- 
sion of a psychiatric hospital are properly 
considered highly sensitive [21(2)(f)],and 
disclosure of these addresses would con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy pursuant to section 21 of the Act. 


Where an individual does not object to 
the disclosure of his or her name, disclo- 
sure of the name would not be an unjus- 
tified invasion of personal privacy. 


Where the appellant knows the indi- 
vidual’s name from his everyday experi-

privacy, nor would it satisfy the require- 
ments for exemption under sections 


14(1)(e), 17(1)(d) or 20 of the Act. 


In the circumstances of this appeal, there 


was no compelling public interest in 
disclosing the home addresses which 
clearly outweighed the purpose of pro- 
tection of personal privacy under section 
21 of the Act.

The institution granted partial access to 
the records, claiming section 21 of the 
Act to deny access to the remainder. 
During the processing of the appeal, the 
Patient Advocate consented to the re-

those parts of the record were disclosed

The institution’s decision was not in

The appellant requested access to the 
name of the person or persons who pro- 
vided information to the Liquor Licence 
Board of Ontario which led to the inves- 
tigation and copies of all written reports 
or briefs submitted to the LLBO on the 


subject. 


The institution refused to confirm or 
deny the existence of any records, pursu- 
ant to section 14(3) of the Act. The 
institution advised the appellant that if 
any responsive records existed, access to 
them would be denied pursuant to sec- 
tions 14(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (g) and 14(2)(c) 
of the Act. The institution later aban- 
doned reliance on sections 14(1)(g) and 


14(2)(c). 


ORDER 

The existence of responsive records was 
confirmed. The head was ordered to 
disclose one record. The head’s decision 
not to disclose six records was upheld. 


An institution relying on section 14(3) 
must do more than merely indicate that 
records of the nature requested, if they 
exist, would qualify for exemption under 
section 14(1) or (2). An institution must 
provide detailed and convincing evidence 
that disclosure of the mere existence of 
the requested records would convey in- 
formation to the requester which could 
compromise the effectiveness of a law 
enforcement activity. By simply con- 
firming that records associated with an 
investigation exist, the institution is not 
required to confirm the content of the 
records. Rather the institution is re- 
quired to providea general description of 
each record, with enough detail so that 
the requester has an understanding of the 
types of records held by the institution. 


14 


The head did not provide sufficient evi- 
dence to show that disclosure of the fact 
that responsive records existed would 
convey information to the requester 
which would compromise the effective- 
ness of a law enforcement activity. 


An investigation under the Liquor L1- 
cence Actqualifies as a “law enforcement” 
matter. The source of the information 
identified in two of the records specifi- 
cally requested confidentiality, and this 
was confirmed by a statement in one of 
the records. Assurances of confidential- 
ity given to the source by the Liquor 
Licence Board are also stated in one of the 
records. These two records qualified for 
exemption under section 14(1)(d). 


Until the hearing process under the Liq- 
uor Licence Actis finalized, the investiga- 
tion will not becomplete. Records which 
could enable the parties under investiga- 
tion to obstruct the course of the investi- 
gation and prosecution process qualified 
for exemption under section 14(1)(b).

involved in a competition, without iden- 


tifying those involved, and records re- 
lated to an investigation of the competi- 
tion, if one took place, including the 
identity of those involved. 


The institution denied access to certain 
responsive records pursuant to section 21 

of the Act, and later added sections 
18(1)(c)and (d) as newexemption claims 
with respect to the competition question 
and answer sheets. The institution re- 
fused to confirm or deny the existence of 
records related to an investigation pursu- 
ant to section 21(5) of the Acz. 


ORDER 

The existence of responsive records was 
confirmed. The head was ordered to 
disclose the question and answer sheets. 
Thehead’s decision not to disclose records 
related to the investigation was upheld. 


Information contained in competition 
question and answer sheets is not the type 
of information which section 18 was 
designed to protect. 


An institution relying on section 21(5) 
must do more than merely indicate that 
the disclosure of the records would con- 
stitutean unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy. An institution must provide 
detailed and convincing evidence that 
disclosure of the mere existence of the 


- requested records would convey infor- 


mation to the requester, and that disclo- 
sure of this information would constitute 
an unjustified invasion of personal pri- 
vacy. By simply confirming that records 
associated with an investigation exist, the 
head is not confirming that any identifi- 
able individual was investigated. Rather, 
the head is merely confirming that records 
associated with sucha process exist, with- 
out indicating the parties involved. The 
head did not provide sufficient evidence 
to show that disclosure of the existence of 
records relating to an investigation would 
convey information to the requester which

would constitute an unjustified invasion

Letters and notes related to an investiga-

Records which outline information about 
the administration of a competition are 
not properly considered part of any indi- 
vidual’s employment history [21(3)(d)], 
however, they could properly be charac- 
terizedas highly sensitive [21 (2)(f)]. Dis- 
closure of the records relating to the

an unjustified invasion of personal pri-

fiveagencies, together with briefing notes, 
memoranda, records of telephone con- 
versations, records of complaint and 
follow-up action pertaining to the five 
agencies. 


The institution granted partial access to 
the responsive records, subject to 
severances under sections 17(1)(a) and 
(c) and 21 of the Act. During the course 


of appeal, the issues were narrowed to the 
proper application of section 17(1). 


ORDER 

The head was ordered to disclose the 
records to the appellant, with personal 
information severed. 


The linkage of names of various agencies 
to alleged illegal practices in one record is 
not sufficient to characterize this infor- 
mation as “commercial information”. 


The remaining records pertained or re- 
lated to or dealt with commerce, and 
qualified as commercial information. 
These records were also supplied to the 
institution in confidence. The evidence 
provided by the institution and the af- 
fected person in support of the harms 
specified in sections 17(1)(a) and (c) was 
too speculative and remote to establish a 
reasonable expectation of sufficient 
prejudice to competitive position, or 
undue loss to the agency or gain to its 
competitors.

The appellant requested access to a 
number of Supreme Court of Ontario 
court files and actions in which theappel- 
lant was the plaintiff. 


The institution granted partial access to 
the responsive records, claiming sections 
19, 21 and 22 of the Act to deny access. 
During the course of appeal, the scope of 
the appeal was narrowed to one letter 
from an insurance adjustment bureau to 
the law firm which was representing the 
institution ina courtaction involving the 


appellant. The institution claimed that 


the record was exempt pursuant to sec- 


tions 19 and 49(a) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


A severed version of the record was origi- 
nally included among the records dis- 
closed by the institution in response to 
theappellant’s request. Theentire record 
was released, subject to the severance of 
one sentence, which was exempted un- 
der section 21 of the Act. During the 
course of the appeal, the institution ar- 
ranged to have the record retrieved from 
the appellant, and denied further access 
to it. In responding to the original 
request, the designated head must be 
deemed to have either concluded that the 
record, with the exception of the section 
21 severance, did not qualify for exemp- 
tion, or chosen to exercise his discretion 
against claiming exemption under sec- 
tion 19. 


Thesevered sentence contained the views 
or opinions of the affected person which 
related to matters other than the appel- 
lant, and thereby qualified as personal 
information of the affected person. The 
remainder of the record contained the 
personal information of the appellant 
only. 


The severance did not contain informa- 
tion relevant to the appellant’s conten- 
tion that disclosure of his clinical record 
had taken place contrary to the Mental 
Health Act. Theaftected person supplied

The appellant requested access to all 
information relating to investigations 
pertaining to himself. In particular, he 
sought access to information relating to 
his arson, fraud and murder investiga- 
tions. 


The institution granted partial access to 
the records, and claimed exemptions 
under sections 14(1)(c) and (e), 14(2)(a), 
15(b), 21, 49(a) and/or 49(b) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


Parts of the record contained the per- 
sonal information of the affected persons 
only. These parts of the record were 
compiled as part of an investigation into 
a possible violation of law, and therefore 
the requirements for a presumed unjus- 
tified invasion of privacy were met. The 
arguments in favour of disclosing these 
parts of the record were not sufficient to 
outweigh the presumed unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy of the affected 
persons. 


Parts of the record contained the per- 
sonal information of the appellant and 
other identifiable individuals. These parts 
of the record were also compiled as part 
of an investigation into a possible viola- 
tion of law, and disclosure would consti- 
tute an unjustified invasion of the per- 
sonal privacy of the affected persons. 


Part of the record contained the personal 
information of the appellant only. This 
part of the record contained information 
that was forwarded to the institution by 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on 
a confidential basis, and therefore quali- 


fied for exemption under section 15(b) of 
the Act. 


Parts of the record did not contain per- 
sonal information. Disclosure of one of 
these parts would reveal information re- 
ceived by the institution in confidence 
from the Department of Justice, and 
therefore qualified for exemption under 
section 15(b) of the Act. The institution 
did not claim an exemption for the re- 
maining parts of the record, and was 
ordered to disclose these parts.

is an express contradiction between 
the Act and the Code where a request 
for access to such records is made un- 
der the Actand the record exists. There 
is an operational conflict between the 
Act and the Code where a request for 
access to such records is made under 
the Act in situations where a record 
does not exist. Asa result, the doctrine 
of federal legislative paramountcy op- 
erates so as to exclude requests for 
wiretap application records from the

Applying section 14(3) in all cases in- 
volving a particular type of record would 
represent an improper exercise of discre-

decision maker to adopt a policy under 
which decisions are made, it is not proper 
to apply this policy inflexibly to all cases. 
In order to properly exercise discretion 
under sections 14(3) and 49(a), a head 
must take into consideration factors per-

that the decision conforms to the poli- 
cies, objects and provisions of the Act.

The appellant requested access to a copy 
ofa legal opinion prepared at the request 
of the institution, dealing with a conflict 
of interest which might exist within the 
institution. The institution denied ac- 
cess to the records pursuant to section 12 


of the Act. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the record to the appellant. 


The record consisted of a confidential 
written communication between aclient 
and a legal advisor directly related to 
giving legal advice and therefore was 
subject to the common law solicitor- 
client privilege recognized in section 12. 
However, the institution’s release of the 
record to the individual whose appoint- 
ment was the subject of the record consti- 
tuted a waiver of the solicitor-client privi- 
lege. Because the institution waived the 
privilege, it could not rely on the exemp- 
tion found in section 12 of the Act. 


Portions of the record contained per- 
sonal information of the subject of the 
record but was found not to constitute a 
presumed unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy because it did not consist of 
personal recommendations or evalua- 
tions, character references or personnel 
evaluations [section 14(3)(g)],and though 
it may have indicated the individual’s 
political associations [section 14(3)(h)] 
this information was clearly well known. 
None of the considerations listed in sec-

the information did not qualify for ex- 
emption under section 14.

The institution granted access to the 
resolution and by-law, but denied access 
_to the written agreement entered into 
between the institution and the named 


individual pursuant to section 14 of the 
Act. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the record, with the exception of the 


salary steps. 


The date of the agreement, parties, 
recitals, execution of the agreement, and 
certain clauses were not recorded infor- 
mation about an identifiable individual. 


The record was a contract of employ- 
ment, not a contract for personal serv- 
ices, therefore section 14(4)(b) of the 
Act had no application. 
because the named individual was an 
employee of the institution, section 
14(4)(a) did apply, and disclosure of 
the classification, salary range and ben- 
efits or employment responsibilities of 
the named individual would not con- 


However, 


stitute an unjustified invasion of his 


personal privacy. 


Although the record itselfdid not specifi- 
cally refer to the amount of the salary and 
salary increases, the specific steps are 
referable to specific salary amounts con- 
tained in a chart provided by the institu- 
tion. In the circumstances, disclosure of 
the salary steps would constitute disclo- 
sure of the income of the individual and 
is therefore presumed to constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 


under section 14(3)(f). 


The scheduled and possible additional 
salary increases and the information in- 
cluded in the remaining clauses did not 
fall within the types of information listed 
in section 14(3), and would not consti- 
tute an unjustified invasion of the per- 
sonal privacy of the individual. No com- 
bination of factors existed to rebut the 
presumption found in section 14(3)(f).

reasonable steps to locate record 


The appellant requested access to a Per- 
manent Ward Order relating to the re- 
quester and his three siblings. The record 
was created in 1956and would have been 
forwarded to the institution because of 
its financial obligations relating to the 
wardship. 


The institution stated that it was not in 
possession of a copy of the record, and 
therefore access could not be granted. 


ORDER 

The institution’s search for the requested 
record was reasonable in the circum- 
stances. 


The institution divested itself of records 
of this nature in 1967 when welfare 
ceased to be a city function and was 
assumed by the Municipality of Metro- 
politan Toronto. At that time, such 
records were transferred to the Munici- 
pality of Metropolitan Toronto or de- 
stroyed. Searches were conducted by 
both the city and Metro, and the steps 
taken by the institution to locate the 
record and the transfer of records were 
verified by affidavit evidence, and by 
other evidence in the form of memo- 
randa prepared by persons who con- 
ducted the searches. The information 
provided by the appellant did not lead to 
the conclusion that a record presently 
exists within the custody or control of the 
institution.

The institution granted access to five

sent to the appellant identified each 
school not by name, but by an alpha-

The institution denied access to the 
records pursuant to section 10 of the Act. 


ORDER | 
The head’s decision was not upheld, and 
the records were ordered disclosed. 


The research company did not provide 
sufficient information to support the 
position that the information was the 
subject of efforts which are reasonable 
under the circumstances to maintain its 
secrecy, which is a necessary element of 
the definition of trade secret. 


Providing access under the Act does not 
constitute an infringement of copyright, 


because of the terms of the Copyright Act. 


Even if the population and income fore- 
casting formulas or models used to create 
the record qualified as trade secrets, the 


record did not contain these models or 
formulas themselves, nor would disclo-

drawn regarding the nature of the models 
or formulas. 


Simply because information was pur- 
chased by the institution does not make

The appellant requested access to the 
name of an individual seeking access to 
records relating to the appellant. 


The institution denied access to the name 
of the individual under section 14 of the 
Act. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the name to the appellant. 


Where a name appears in the context of 
a request for access to information under 
the Act, disclosure of the name would 
reveal both (a) the fact thatan identifiable 
individual made a request under the Act, 
and (b) the nature of the request. This 
renders the name of the requester “per- 
sonal information”. 


A person’s name does not describe any of 
the types of information listed in section 
14(3)(f) and, without more, would not 
constitute employment history within 
the meaning of section 14(3)(d). No 
presumption of an unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy existed. 


ne 


The Act does not explicitly or implicitly 
impose a general rule of non-disclosure 
of the names of requesters, and there was 
no indication on the individual’s request 
of a desire that the name be kept confi- 


dential. 


The individual did not provide suffi- 
cient evidence to establish that he or she 
would be exposed unfairly to pecuniary 
or other harm, or that his or her name as 
requester is sensitive information. 


Because the individual requested access 
to personal information of the appellant, 
the appellant had an interest in knowing 
the identity of the individual, and disclo- 
sure of the name would not be an unjus- 
tified invasion of the individual’s privacy. 


Disclosure of the name of the indivi 
dual would not reveal any trade secret, 
technical or commercial information, 
and the name alone does not qualify 
for exemption under section 10.

questioned the authority cited by the

CONCLUSIONS 

The IPC concluded that the notice form

CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the letter in-

in section 65(2)(b) of the Act. Specifi- 
cally, Section 65(2)(b) of the Act states: 


65.-(2) This Act does not apply to a record 
in respect of a patient in a psychiatric facility 
as defined by section I of the Mental Health 


Act, where the record, 


(b)contains information in respect of the 
history, assessment, diagnosis, observation,

An individual complained that the insti-

mation by forwarding copies of two let-

CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the letters at 
issue contained the complainant’s per- 
sonal information as defined by the Act. 
A complaint against a nurse had been 
filed by the complainant; these letters 
referred to this complaint. They had 
been forwarded to the Legal Counsel, 
who had represented the nurse at a hear- 
ing before the institution’s Complaints 
Review Committee, for his written sub- 
missions. Thus, the IPC determined 
that the institution’s disclosure had been 
reasonably consistent with the purposes 
for which the personal information had 
been collected. Accordingly, the IPC was 
of the view that the institution had dis- 
closed the complainant's personal infor-

A student at the institution complained 
that following a confidential conversa-

collected his personal information in con- 
travention of the Acz, and without giving 
notice. In addition, his personal infor- 
mation was disclosed to other faculty 
members, and an external source. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the collection 
and use of the personal information was 
made in accordance with the proper 
administration of a lawfully authorized 
activity, i.e. evaluating student perform- 
ance. Disclosure was made: a) to an 
officer of the institution who needed the 
information for the necessary and proper 
discharge of the institution’s functions, 
b) for a consistent purpose, and c) in 
compelling circumstances that appeared 
to affect the health or safety of the com- 


plainant. 


We found however that adequate notice 
was not given at the time of the verbal 
collection. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 
The IPC recommended that: 


In future similar situations, faculty should 
give verbal notice that the personal infor- 
mation may be used for evaluation pur- 
poses. If the personal information is 
subsequently recorded, written notice 
should be given in accordance with sec-

CONCLUSIONS 
The IPC determined that: 


28 


(a) the complainant’s personal informa- 
tion had been disclosed in a document 
which had been prepared exclusively for 
the use of the former Minister of the 
institution, but which had been sent toa 
person in the U.K. The institution’s 
position was that it had been “inadvert- 
ently enclosed” with a letter from the 
Minister. 


(b)none of the exceptions set out in 
section 42 of the Act applied to the 
institution’s disclosure of the complain- 
ant’s personal information. Therefore, 
the disclosure of the complainant's per- 
sonal information had not been in com- 
pliance with section 42 of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 

Notwithstanding the fact that the Min- 
ister involved and his staff were no longer

mended that the institution take precau- 
tions to ensure that all disclosures of 
personal information were made in ac- 
cordance with the provisions of the Act. 


The institution, in response, assured the

Anindividual complained that the Work-

not have disclosed details of the injury 
which he had sustained with his previous 
employer to his present employer. 


CONCLUSIONS 

The IPC determined that the complain- 
ant had two injuries: one had been sus- 
tained with his previous employer, the 
other with his present employer. In cal- 
culating the complainant’s total award, 
the WCB had applied a specific factor 
which took into account both disabili- 
ties. Therefore, it had been necessary for 
the WCB to inform the complainant’s 
present employer of the injury he had 
with his previous employer in order to 
explain this calculation. 


The IPC concluded that the WCB’s 
disclosure (to his present employer) of 
the complainant’s injury sustained with 
his previous employer had been for a 
“consistent purpose” and could reason- 
ably have been expected in the circum- 
stances. Therefore, the disclosure had 
been in accordance with the Act.

Three of these occasions involved disclo-

embassy who had sponsored the com- 
plainant to come to Canada. The disclo- 
sures were said to have been verbal and 
the complainant did not specify exactly 
what personal information was disclosed. 


CONCLUSIONS 

The IPC determined that only one of the 
occasions cited by the complainant in- 
volved the disclosure of personal infor- 
mation. This involved the institution 
disclosing a letter, containing four pieces 
of the complainant’s personal infor- 
mation, to an employee of a federal

The IPC concluded that the institution 
had disclosed the complainant's personal 
information, which included her name, 
address, and two file numbers, when it 
senta letter confirming a verbal exchange 
to an employee of a federal institution. 
The institution did not comply with

compliance when it disclosed the com-

The IPC determined that the complain- 
ant’s personal information had not been

tution had collected and used her hus- 
band’s personal information, contrary to 
the provisions of the Act. The individu- 
al’s concerns arose when the institution 
had sent her husband, a non-Catholic, a 
letter requesting him to redirect his taxes 
from the public to the separate school 
system. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the informa- 
tion in question was contained in a pub- 
lic record entitled, “Property Assessment 
Public Information”. Section 27 of the 
Act states that Part II of the Act, which 
deals with the collection, retention, use 
and disclosure of personal information, 
does not apply to personal information 


that is maintained for the purpose of 
creating a record available to the general 
public. Thus, the IPC concluded that 
the institution had notcollected norused 
the personal information in question 
contrary to Part II of the Act.

The institution denied access to the re- 
sponsive records under sections 13(1), 
17(1)(a), (b) and (c), and 18(1)(a), (©) 
(d), (e), (f) and (g) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the records. 


None of the records contained informa- 
tion which could properly be character- 
ized asasuggested course of action which 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


would ultimately be accepted or rejected 
by its recipient during the deliberative 
process and therefore did not qualify for 
exemption under section 13(1) of the 
Act. 


Records contained ina publicly available 
court file did not qualify for exemption 
under section 17(1) as the institution 
and/or the affected persons failed to 
establish that the prospect of disclosure 
of thesealready publicly available records 
would give rise to a reasonable expecta- 
tion that one of the types of harms 
specified in (a), (b) or (c) ofsection 17(1) 


will occur. 


One record would permit the drawing of 
accurate inferences with respect to com- 
mercial and/or financial information 
actually supplied to the institution by 
the affected persons implicitly in confi- 
dence. The institution’s generalized ref- 
erences to harm to the affected persons 
was not sufficiently detailed and con- 
vincing to support a reasonable expecta- 
tion of one of the types of harms speci- 
fied in sections 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) and, 
therefore, the record did not qualify for 


exemption under section 17(1). 


The information itself had no intrinsic 
monetary value, and the institution did 
not express an intention of publishing or 
disseminating this information in a way 
that would result in some form of mon- 
etary payment to the institution. There- 
fore section 18(1)(a) did not apply. 
The institution failed to provide detailed 
and convincing evidence that disclosure 
ofthe information contained in the record 
could reasonably be expected to result in 
the types of harms specified in sections 
18(1)(c), (d) and (g), and these sections 
did not apply. 


A statement that the records disclose the 
positions and criteria of terms applicable 
to present arrangements that are to be 


applied to continuing negotiations for 
complete terms is not sufficient to estab- 
lish the requirements ofsection 1 8(1)(e). 


Because some form of agreement must 
have been reached in order to put the 
SkyDome complex into operation, the 
institution’s statement that the draft 
agreement is a “plan” that had not yet 
been put into operation was not ac- 


cepted, and section 18(1)(f) did not 
apply.

The appellant requested access to the 
educational history of five individuals, 
four of whom were either currently or 
formerly employed within the Fuels 
Safety Branch of the institution. The 
institution provided access to the job 
specifications for certain relevant posi- 
tions, and denied access to the educa- 
tional history of four of the individuals 
pursuant to section 21 of the Act. The 
fifth individual was not employed by the 


institution. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision was upheld. 


All parties agreed that the record con- 
sisted of personal information, and that 


the disclosure of the information would 
result in a presumed unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy under section 


21(3)(d) of the Act. 


The records did not contain any of the 
types of information described in sec- 
tion 21(4), and this section did not 
operate to rebut the presumption under 
section 21(3)(d). No publicdemand for 
the scrutiny of the government or its 
agencies had been established in this 
appeal, and section 21(2)(a) was not a 
relevant consideration. The appellant’s 
assertion that disclosure of the affected 
persons’ educational history may pro- 
mote public health and safety was too 
remote to establish the requirements of 
section 21(2)(b), and this section was 
not arelevant consideration. Therefore, 
the presumed unjustified invasion of 
privacy was not rebutted, and the records 
were properly exempt. 


Section 23 did not apply to override 
section 21, as there was no compelling 
public interest in the disclosure of the 
records.

The appellant requested access to a re- 
port prepared for the president of the 
institution byaconsultant commissioned 
to review matters pertaining to the School 
of Social and Community Services at the 
institution’s Lakeshore campus. The 
institution denied access to the entire 
record citing sections 17(1)(a), 18(1)(f) 
and (g), 21 and 49(b) of the Act. During 
the course of the appeal, the institution 
withdrew its section 49(b) exemption 
claim, and added section 13(1) as a new 
exemption. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


The information contained in the record 
was supplied by the institution’s faculty, 
staff, administrators and students. The 
institution’s faculty and staff are part of 
the institution and do not qualify as third 
parties for the purposes of section 17. 
The interests of the students are more 
appropriately addressed under section 
21. Therefore, the information was not 
“supplied” to the institution for the pur- 
poses of section 17, and this section did 


not apply. 


The record contained certain recom- 
mendations which, if adopted and im- 
plemented, might involve the formula- 
tion of a detailed plan, but the record 
itself was not a plan or a proposed plan, 


and section 18(1)(f) and (g) did not 
apply. 


Portions of the record consisted of a 
suggested course of action, and qualified 
as advice under section 13(1). However, 
the recommendations were corrective in 
nature, and were aimed at enabling the 
institution to deal efficiently with exist- 
ing and future issues and concerns, and 
assisting the president to improve ad- 
ministrative operations. The record fell 
within the section 13(2)(f) exception, 
thereby precluding the institution from 


denying access to the record under sec- 
tion 13(1) of the Act. 


Even with the names severed, some of the 
remaining information consisted of per- 
sonal views and opinions of certain indi- 
viduals who would be identifiable by 
virtue of the nature of the information 
provided, and this information qualified 
as personal information. Other parts of 
the record consisted of personal opinions 
or views of or about other identifiable 
individuals, and qualified as personal 
information. None of the information 
contained in the record was the personal 
information of the appellant, and por- 
tions of the record did not contain per- 
sonal information. 


The personal information consisted of a 
review and recommendations about the 
job performance of identifiable individu- 
als, and met the requirements for a pre- 
sumed unjustified invasion of privacy 
under section 21(3)(g). The concerns 
raised by the appellant about public scru- 
tiny, public health and safety, and in- 
formed consumer choice were adequately 
addressed by the disclosure of the parts of 
the record which did not contain per- 
sonal information, and were not suffi- 
cient to rebut the section 21(3)(g) pre- 
sumption.

The appellant requested access to his file 
covering a period served in a correctional 


facility. 


The institution disclosed the appellant’s 
main institution file in its entirety. The 
appellant claimed that the materials pro- 
vided to him were not complete. 


ORDER 
The institution’s search was reasonable. 


During the course of the appeal, the 
institution conducted two further 
searches, and located nine additional 
records. These records were disclosed to 
the appellant. During the inquiry, the 
institution conducted a final search for 
responsive records. Seven individuals 
participated in the final search, each swore 
an affidavit verifying that no additional 
records were found, and the institution 
indicated that all areas of the correctional 
facility where responsive records were 
likely to be located had been searched. 
The appellant did not provide any cred-

any additional responsive records.

The appellant requested access to all

took as a student of the college. 


The college disclosed several records to 
the requester, and denied access to six 
records pursuant to section 18(1)(h) of 
the Act. The appellant maintained that 
additional responsive records existed. 


ORDER 

The college was ordered to disclose the 
records, and the search for responsive 
records was reasonable. 


The records consisted of questions used 
in examinations which have already been 
completed, and contained the answers 
provided by the appellant and his scoring 
on individual questions. The fact that 
the college may, at some point in the 
future, choose to re-use the same 


questions ona subsequent examination 
is not sufficient to satisfy the require- 
ments of section 18(1)(h). 


The college outlined its record retention 
practices, and provided an affidavit 
outlining the searches conducted. The 
appellant did not provide any evidence 
or explanation in support of his position 
that the additional records should exist. 
Thecollege’s search was reasonable in the

Theappellants requested access toa 1976 
report prepared by the Inspection and 
Standards Branch of the Ministry of 
Correctional Services, concerning alleged 
inappropriate staff conduct at the 
Grandview Training School for Girls. 


The Archives denied access to the entire 
record pursuant to section 14(2)(a) ofthe 
Act, and exempted significant portions of 
the record under sections 14(1)(a), (b), 
(c), (d) and (f), 14(2)(d) and 21 of the Act. 
During the course of the appeal, the 
Archives withdrew its exemption claim 
under section 14(1)(c) andadded section 
14(2)(b) in the context of the possible 
application of the Young Offenders Act 
(YOA). 


ORDER 
The Archives’ decision was partially up- 
held. 


The investigation which lead to the 
creation of the record was not conducted 
for the purpose of investigating an offence 
alleged to have been committed by a 
young person; for use in proceedings 
against a young person; or for any other 
type of activity outlined in sections 40, 
42 or 43 of the YOA. Section 45.2 of the 
YOA was not applicable to the record, 
and section 14(2)(b) was not a valid 
exemption claim in the circumstances of 


this appeal. 


The investigation was an internal 


investigation into the operation of a 
training school. Upon completion of the 
investigation, the Ministry was not in a 
position to enforce or regulate compli- 
ance with the Training Schools Actor any 
other law. The Ministry had investiga- 
tory responsibility for ensuring the proper 
administration of training schools, but it 
was the police force and Crown Attor- 
ney’s office which had regulatory respon- 
sibilities oflaw enforcementas envisioned 
by section 14(2)(a) of the Acz, therefore 
this section was not applicable in the 
circumstances of this appeal. 


Parts of the record contained informa- 
tion that qualified as personal informa- 
tion of the subject of the investigation 


and other identifiable individuals. 


Some of the personal information related 
to medical, psychiatric or psychological 
history, diagnosis, condition, treatment 
or evaluation and met the requirements 
for a presumed unjustified invasion of 
privacy under section 21(3)(a). An 
investigation into the operation ofa train- 
ing school did not fall within the mean- 
ing of the word “law” as it is used in 
section 21(3)(b), and this section did not 


apply. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The record did not contain any informa- 
tion that pertained to section 21(4), and 
this section did not operate to rebut the 
presumed unjustified invasion of privacy’ 
under section 21(3)(a). 


Public scrutiny of the activities of the 
Government of Ontario was found to be 
a relevant consideration in the circum- 
stances of this-appeal, but this alone was 
notsufficientto rebut the section 21 (3) (a) 
presumption, and this personal informa- 
tion was properly exempt. 


The remaining parts of the record explic- 
itly documented emotional and physical 
behaviour of employees and wards, and 
included allegations of mistreatmentand 


abuse. Sections 21(2)(f) and (i) were - 


found to be relevant considerations in 
the circumstances of the appeal. Disclo- 
sure of these parts of the record would 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy. 


While there was an element of public 
interest in disclosure of the record, it was 
not sufficiently compelling to clearly 
outweigh the purpose of section 21 of the 
Act, that being the protection of personal 
privacy ofindividuals named in the record. 


The Archives did not provide sufficient 
evidence to establish a reasonable expec- 
tation of the harms identified in sections 
14(1)(a), (b), (d), or (f), and the record 
did not qualify for exemption under 
these sections. 


The term of correctional supervision 
which was in effect for each individual 
who wasa ward at Grandview at the time 
the record was created had expired, and 
section 14(2)(d) did not apply.

The appellant requested access to an 
invoice pertaining to a three court ac- 
tions. The Ministry denied access to the 
records pursuant to clause 6 of section 


67(2) of the of the Act. 


During the course of the appeal, the 
appellant indicated that he was not seek- 
ing any information which identified the 
person to whom the legal fees apply or 
which could lead to the disclosure of that 
person’s identity. The person to whom 
the legal fees applied and his legal counsel 
claimed that sections 17 and 21 applied 
to the record, 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to disclose 
portions of the record. 


While certain documents relating to the 
court actions were ordered by the court 
to be treated as confidential, sealed and 
not form part of the public record under 
section 137(2) of the Courts of Justice Act, 
the record at issue in this appeal was not 
one of them. However, the record did 
contain certain information that would 
reveal information that is subject to the 
court order, specifically the name of the 


-person to whom the legal fees applied 


and personal information which could 


lead to the disclosure of the true name of 
this person. The appellant was not inter- 
ested in receiving this information, there- 
fore it fell outside of the scope of this 
appeal, and could be severed from the 
record. The unsevered parts ofthe record 
did not contain any information which 
fell within the confidentiality provision 
in section 137(2) of the Courts of Justice 
Act, and was subject to the Act. 


The record, as severed, no longer con- 
tained information which qualified as 
personal information, and it was there- 
fore not necessary to consider the appli- 
cability of section 21 of the Act. 


Theinformation contained financial and/ 
or commercial information, but suffi- 
cient evidence to establish that the 
specific record at issue in this appeal was 
supplied to the Ministry in confidence, 
either implicitly or explicitly, was not 
provided. The evidence provided in 
support of a reasonable expectation of 
any of the types of harm specified in 
section 17(1)(a), (b) or (c) was too gener- 
alized and speculative in nature, and the 
record did not qualify for exemption 
under section 17(1)(a), (b) or (c).

closed record as having to be filed as an 


exhibit at the trial. The Ministry denied 
access to the information pertaining to 
the witnesses pursuant to sections 14(2)(a) 
and 21 of the Act. With respect to the 
exhibit, the Ministry was unable to locate 
any such record. The requester appealed 
the Ministry’s decision. 


ORDER 

The Ministry’s search for the exhibit was 
reasonable in the circumstances. The 
decision of the Ministry with regard to 
access was upheld. 


The information regarding the witnesses 
contained the age and medical condition 
of one witness and the age, address, place 
of employment and occupation of a sec- 
ond witness. This information qualifies 
as personal information of the individual 
to whom it relates. 


The records were compiled and are iden- 
tifiable as an investigation into a possible 
violation of law. Accordingly, the 
requirements for presumed unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy under sec- 
tion 21(3)(b) have been established. The 
records at issue in this appeal do not 


contain any information relevant to 
section 21(4). 


Section 21(2)(d) is not a relevant factor. 
Accordingly, the presumption raised by 
section 21(3)(b) of the Acthas not been 
rebutted and the disclosure of the per- 
sonal information of the two witnesses 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of their personal privacy. The record is 
exempt under section 21 of the Act.

The Ministry receiveda request for records 
relating toa proposal by the Scarborough 
General Hospital to construct an office 
building. The Ministry denied access to 
some of the responsive records pursuant 
to sections 13(1), 17(1) and 19 of the Act. 
The requester appealed the Ministry's 
decision. During mediation, the Minis- 
try withdrew the section 19 exemption 
claim entirely and the section 17 claim as 
it applied to certain records. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


Parts of Record 1 qualify for exemption 
under section 13(1) of the Act because 
disclosure would reveal the advice and 
recommendations of a consultant re- 
tained by the Ministry. Factual material 
contained in these parts of the record is so 
interwoven with the advice and recom- 
mendations that it can not reasonably be 
severed pursuant to section 10(2) of the 


Act. 


Record two, a lease, contains details of a 
transaction involving the lease of land. 
The information qualifies as commercial 
information, thereby satisfying the first 
part of the section 17 test. This record 
was also supplied to the institution in 
confidence. Because the representations 
contain only generalized references to

possible harms, they are speculative and 
lack sufficient supporting evidence to 
satisfy the requirements of the third part 
of the test. Therefore, the lease does not 
qualify forexemption under section 17 (1) 
of the Act. 


Record 3, an excerpt from the Hospital 
Operating Policy Manual does not qualify 


for exemption under section 17. 


Records 4 and 5, property value apprais- 
als, contain commercial information, 
supplied to the institution implicitly in 
confidence. Therefore, this record satis- 
fies parts one and two of the section 17 
test. It is not reasonable to assume that 
parties seeking the Minister’s approval 
would no longer continue to submit 
appraisals, if required to do so in order to 
obtain the necessary Ministry approvals. 
The representations with regard to pos- 
sible harm are speculative and not suffi- 
cient to establish an exemption claim 
under section 17(1). Therefore, the prop- 
erty value appraisal does not qualify for 
exemption under 17(1).

_ The Ministry receiveda request for access 
_ to copies of all correspondence in the 
- custody and control of the Ministry, 


relating to any allegation of wrongdoing, 
discipline, character and behaviour of the 
requester. Access was denied to part of 
the responsive record pursuant to sec- 
tions 49(a), 49(b), 14(1)(f) and 20 of the 
Act. The record at issue appeared to 
contain the personal information of nine 


individuals other than the appellant. 


ORDER 
The Ministry's order was partially up- 
held. | 


All but page one of the records at issue 
contained the personal information of 
both theappellantand one or more of the 
other individuals. 


Any remedy available to the appellant 
through the grievance process lies against 
the Ministry, not the appellant’s super- 
visor. Even if it were assumed that the 
appellant’s supervisor’s rights are deter- 
mined in some way in the context of the 
appellant’s grievance, neither the Minis- 
try nor the appellant’s supervisor has 
demonstrated how “unequal disclosure” 
outside the grievance proceeding could 
reasonably be expected to deprive the 
appellant’s supervisor of impartial adju- 
dication. Neither the appellant's super- 
visor nor the Ministry has provided any 
evidence toshowthata trial ora judication 
involving the rights of the appellant’s 
supervisor outside the context of the 
appellants grievance has commenced or 
isanticipated. Therefore, section 14(1)(f) 
does not apply in relation to any rights of 
the appellant’s supervisor. In order to 
establish unfairness the Ministry mustdo 
more than simply identify that a griev- 
ance has commenced. 


Section 49(b) introducesa balancing prin- 
ciple. The Ministry must look at the 
information and weigh the requesters 
right of access to his own personal infor- 
mation against other individuals right to 
the protection of their privacy. The 


severed portions of the pages for which 
the Ministry has claimed section 21 (3)(d) 
do not contain any information which 
could accurately be characterized as the 
employment history of individuals other 
than the appellant. None of the consid- 
erations contained in section 21(2) or (3) 
are relevantto some portions of the record 
in the circumstances of this appeal. Dis- 
closure of other portions of the record 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of the personal privacy of individuals 
other than the appellant and, therefore, 
qualify for exemption under section 49(b) 
of the Act.

The Ministry received a request for access 
to copies of daily live chicken slaughter 
reports at a named company for the 
period January 1, 1991 to June 24, 1991. 
The Ministry denied access pursuant to 
section 17(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Ministry was not 
upheld. 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 17(1)(a) or (c) of the Act the 
Ministryand/or theaffected person must 
establish the requirements of all three 
parts of the section 17 test. 


The information at issue is commercial 
information and was supplied in confi- 
dence to the Ministry. In the absence of 
representations from the affected person, 
the submissions made by the Ministry 
are speculative as they relate to the harm 
where the affected person might suffer if 
the record is disclosed. Therefore, the 
record does not qualify for exemption 
under section 17(1)(a). 


Section 47(2)(d) of Regulation 607 un- 
der the Meat Inspection Act clearly re- 
quires that records of the number of 
animals and the dates of slaughter be kept 
for inspection. Section 47(3) of the 
regulation imposes an obligation on every 
plant operator to produce these records 
for inspection when required to do so by 
the Ministry. The Ministry failed to 
establish that disclosure of the informa- 
tion contained in the record would result 
in similar information no longer being 
supplied and the record does not qualify 


for exemption under section 17(1)(b).

ORDER 


The decision of the Ministry was not 
upheld. 


The information contained in the record 
is the personal information of both the 
appellant and other individuals.

Disclosure of the names of co-workers, 
which were provided by the appellant, 
would not constitute an unjustified inva- 
sion of the personal privacy of these 
individuals. Disclosure of other infor- 
mation which has been provided in its 
entirety to the appellant would not con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of the per- 
sonal privacy ofany individual referred to 
in the record. 


Some information contained in the record 
was compiled as part of an investigation 
into a possible violation of law and, 
therefore, satisfies the requirements fora 
presumed unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy under section 21(3)(b). 
These records do not contain any infor- 
mation relevant to section 21(4) and 
there is no combination of factors listed 
in section 21(2) which would operate to 
rebut the presumption of an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy. Therefore, 
the presumption raised by section 


21(3)(b) of the Act applies. 


The discretionary exemption provided 
by section 14(2)(a) does not apply to the 
“Fact Sheet”, the “Intake Report”, the 
notes of telephone conversations and 
interviews and the “Case Disposition” 
form, as they do not meet the definition 
of report. 


Section 14(1)(d) would not apply to the 
record as disclosure would not identify 
the witnesses who provided statements 
during the course of the Commission’s 
investigation. The names of the 
witnesses have been protected under 
section 21. 


The discretionary exemption provided 
by section 13 of the Actapplies only to 
the parts of the record that can be 
properly characterized as advice or recom- 
mendations.

Section 49(a) provides an exemption to

the appellant his own personal informa-

Ontario Hydro received a request for

and the final contract orcontracts awarded 
in relation toa particular tender for cleri- 
cal and drafting supplies. Ontario Hydro 
denied access to the tender material 
under section 17(1)(a) and (c) of the Act 
and stated that no information relating 
to the contract existed. The requester 
appealed only the denial of access to the 
tender material. 


ORDER 
Ontario Hydro's decision was partially 


upheld. 


The information contained in the tender 
submitted by five companies relates to 
the sale and purchase of materials, out- 


lines each company's quote of the cost to 
supply Ontario Hydro with clerical and 
drafting supplies and includes a descrip- 
tion of its electronic transmission capa- 
bilities. This information qualifies as 
commercial and/or financial informa- 
tion. 


In light of Ontario Hydro's tendering 
process for the matter, the tenders were 
supplied by the companies to Ontario 
Hydro in confidence. 


Because one of the companies is no longer 
in existence, no harm can result from 
disclosure of the records related to it. 
However there is sufficient evidence to 
support the assertion that disclosure of 
the records supplied by the remaining 
four companies might reasonably be ex- 
pected to significantly prejudice the com- 
petitive position of these companies. 
Therefore all three parts of the section 17

INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The Ministry received a request for access 
to all information regarding any charges 
relating to the requester, including any 
wiretap application records. The records 
were located in the Crown Law Office, 
Criminal and in the Office of the Direc- 
tor of Criminal Prosecutions. The insti- 
tution denied access to the records pursu- 
ant to sections 22(a), 13(1), 14(1)(o), 
14(1)(d), 14(1)(e), 19 and 21 of the Act. 
The existence of wiretap application 
records was neither confirmed nor de- 
nied, pursuant to section 14(3) ofthe Act. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


The doctrine of federal legislative para- 
mountcy operates so as to exclude re- 
quests for wiretap applications from the 


scope of the Act. 


Transcripts of trial proceedings, factums, 
appeal books, case books, court notices, 
court forms and endorsements qualify 
for exemption pursuant to section 22(a) 
of the Act as all of this information is 
currently available to the public. How- 
ever, there is nothing in the Act which 
prevents the Ministry from disclosing 
records which are properly exempt under 
section 22(a). 


A package of records which was com- 
piled by the RCMP and supplied to 
Police, who in turn provided it to the 
Ministry, satisfies the requirement for 
exemption under section 15(b). The 
disclosure of these records would reveal 
information received from another gov- 
ernment or its agency, the RCMP, in 
confidence. The expectation of confi- 
dentiality survives the passing of the docu- 
ments from the RCMP to the Police and 
on to the Ministry, in the circumstances 


of this appeal.

Section 19 applies to information pre- 
pared by or for Crown Counsel in con- 
templation oflitigation in both the Crown 
Law Office and Criminal Prosecution 
Files. 


Statements of a witness contained in a 
Criminal Prosecution File contain the 
personal information ofindividuals other 
than the appellant. With the exception 
of certain names, invoices submitted by 
an accounting firm do not contain per- 
sonal information. The social insurance 
number of a physician who examined a 
witness and the name of the witness is 
personal information of individuals other 


than the appellant. 


The witness statements were compiled as 
part of an investigation into a possible 
violation of law and satisfy the require- 
ments of section 21(3)(b). Section 21 (4) 
does not apply to this information. Sec- 
tion 21(2)(d) would not be sufficient to 
rebut the presumed unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy. 


The disclosure of the names and the 
social insurance number would consti- 
tute an unjustified invasion of the per- 
sonal privacy of these individuals.

The Archives received a request trans- 
ferred to it from the Ministry of the 
Solicitor General for access to all infor- 
mation relating to a fire that occurred at 
the requester’s residence in August 1978. 
Partial access was granted. Access was 
denied to the remaining pages in whole 
or in part pursuant to sections 14(1)(d), 
(e), (g), 14(2)(a), 15(b) and 21(1)(f) of 
the Act.

The Archives’ decision was partially up- 
held. 


Section 15(b) applies to a letter which 
was received in confidence by the OPP 
from the RCMP. Disclosure of this 
record would reveal information received 
in confidence. 


Information severed from the record 
which relates to the names and titles of 
individuals acting in their professional or 
business capacities can not be categorized 
as personal information. As no other 
exemptions have been claimed for this 
information and since no mandatory 
exemptions apply they should be dis- 
closed to the appellant. 


The remaining parts of the records at 
issue contain personal information of 
individuals other than theappellant. This 
personal information was compiled and 
is identifiable as part of an investigation 
into a possible violation of law, namely 
an arson investigation conducted by the 
OPP and the Office of the Fire Marshall. 
They do not contain information rel- 
evant to section 21(4). Section 21(2)(d) 
would not be sufficient to rebut the 
presumed unjustified invasion of the pri- 
vacy of the individuals to whom the 
information relates.

The Ministry receiveda request for access 
to copies of correspondence between an 
individual and the Ministry, in which the 
requester had been referred to by name. 
The Ministry decided to grant access to 
those parts of the correspondence in 
which the individual expressed opinions 
about the requester and notified the indi- 
vidual of its decision. In response, the 
individual asked for the name of the 
original requester. The original requester 
advised the Ministry that he/she wished 
to remain anonymous. The Ministry 
refused to inform the individual of the 
name of the original requester, relying on 
section 21 of the Act. The individual 
appealed the Ministry’s decision to deny 


access to the name. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


Disclosure of the name of the requester 
would reveal both the fact that the origi- 
nal requester made a request under the 
Actand the nature of the request. ‘There- 
fore, the name of the requester is personal 
information as defined as by the Act. 


The Actdoes not specifically or impliedly 


impose a general rule of non-disclosure 


of the names of requesters. The fairest 
approach in adjudicating the issue is to 
weigh any competing rights of the re- 
quester and any other parties. 


The right of the original requester to 
anonymity must be balanced against the 
right of the appellant to know the name 
of the person who requested access to 
information which may be the personal 
information of both the appellant and 
the original requester. On balance, the 
disclosure of the name of the requester 
would be an unjustified invasion of his/ 
her personal privacy. The original re- 
quester’s interest in maintaining his/her 
anonymity outweighs the appellant’s 
interest in knowing his/her identity.

The Ministry received a request for access 
to an investigator’s report and recom- 
mendations relating to the investigation 
of the requester’s complaint against three 
Ontario Provincial Police officers. Spe- 
cifically, the requester wanted access to 
the statements of the three officers and 
any information relating to the investiga- 
tor’s conclusion that the requester and 
his lawyer did not agree as to the course 
of events which led to the complaint. 
The requester also sought access to a 
report ofthenumber of complaints made 
against the police officers in the last five 
years. The Ministry notified eight indi- 
viduals of the request and asked them for 
their views regarding disclosure of the 
record. Seven objected to disclosure of 
any personal information that related to 
them. The Ministry denied access to 39 
pages in whole or in part pursuant to 
sections 14(2)(a), 49(a) and 49(b) of the 
Act. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


All of the information contained in the 
record is personal information. All of the 
information with the exception of two 
pages relates to both the appellant and 
other identifiable individuals. 


The record which contains the personal 
information of both the appellant and 
other individuals relates to the Ontario 
Provincial Police investigation into alle- 
gations of breaches of the Code of Of- 
fences of Regulation 791 under the Police 
Actand possible violations of the Crimi- 
nal Code of Canadaby three Officers. All 


of the personal information contained in 


14 


the record was compiled and is identifi- 
able as part of an investigation into a 
possible violation of law and, accord- 
ingly, its disclosure would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
under section 21(3)(b). The record does 
not contain information relevant to sec- 
tion 21(4). Theappellant has notspecifi- 
cally addressed any of the factors identi- 
fied in section 21(2). Therefore the 
presumption raised by section 21(3)(b) 
has not been rebutted and the exemption 


under section 49(b) of the Act applies. 


The two pages which contain the per- 
sonal information of individuals other 
than theappellantalso satisfy the require- 
ments for a presumed unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy under section 
21(3)(b). Section 21(4) is not relevant 
and no combination of circumstances 
under section 21(2) exists to rebut the 
presumption established under section 


21(3)(b).

INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Some of the employers submitted that 
section 14 of the Actapplies to the records. 
Section 14 is the discretionary exemp- 
tion that may be claimed by the Board. 
The Board has not cited this section as 
the basis of exempting any of the records 
and therefore it is not at issue in these 
appeals and will not be addressed in the 


order. 


Some records list the names and ad- 
dresses of the employers with the 50 
highest surcharges in 1991, together with 
the amount of surcharge for each em- 
ployer. Others list only the names and 
addresses of the employers with the high- 
est penalties in 1990 under the relevant 


program. 


The information which relates to the 
amount of surcharge levy or penalty the 
employers were assessed under the Work- 
ers’ Compensation Act qualifies as finan- 
cial information. 


The records which contain only the names 
and addresses of the employers do not 
contain any information about the 
amounts of surcharge, or the nature and 
volume of accidents. It is not accurate to 
characterize the names and addresses as 
commercial, financial or labour relations 
information, oratrade secret. Therefore, 
this information does not meet the first 
part of the test for exemption under 
section 17(1). 


The surcharge amounts were not “sup- 
plied” to the Board by the employers; 
rather, they were calculated by the Board. 
While the information supplied on vari- 
ous forms was used in the calculation of 
the surcharges, it is not possible to ascer- 
tain theactual information provided from 
the surcharge amount themselves. 


The information that an employer oper- 
ates within an industry which falls within 
the jurisdiction of the WCAisa function 


of the industry in which it operates. The 
names and addresses of the employers 
were not supplied to the Board in confi- 
dence. Itis the financial, commercial and 
personal information contained on the 
forms which was supplied in confidence 
and none of this information would be 
revealed through disclosure of the records. 
Therefore, the records do not meet the 
second part of the test for exemption 
under section 17. 


The evidence regarding harm that could 
result of a negative interpretation of the 
information contained in the record is 
not sufficient to establish the third part of 
the section 17 exemption test. The evi- 
dence consists of generalized assertions of 
factand what amounts to, at most, specu- 
lations of possible harm. 


The assessment of surcharges and penal- 
ties under Ontario’s WCA cannot prop- 
erly be considered information which is 
“gathered for the purpose of determining 
tax liability or collecting tax” under sec- 
tion 17(2) of the Acg to find otherwise 
would be inconsistent with the legislative 
intent of section 17(2) and existing juris- 
prudence.

application of the Act psychiatric patient 


¢ clinical record 


The Ministry received six separate re- 
quests from care givers employed by the 
Kingston Psychiatric Hospital. Each 
request was for information concerning 
the care giver that may be in the posses- 
sion of the Psychiatric Patient Advocate 
Office (PPAO) at Kingston Psychiatric 
Hospital or in Toronto. The Ministry 
denied access to all responsive records 
pursuant to section 65(2)(b) of the Act. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to provide 
each of the appellants with a proper 
decision letter. 


The sole issue to be determined in the 
appeal is whether the PPAO records fall 
within the scope of section 65(2)(b) of 
the Act. Section 65(2) was included in 
the Act for two reasons: to acknowledge 
the extra sensitivity of records relating to 
the care and treatment of psychiatric 
patients and to recognize the separate 
access and privacy scheme for psychiatric 
patient records under the Mental Health 
Act. 


All parties agreed that PPAO records do 
not form part of the patient’s “clinical 
record”. Records which fall under sec- 
tion 65(2)(b) are not covered by the 
alternate access scheme contained in the 
Mental Health Act. Yo beconsistent with 
the purposes of the Act, subsection (b) 
should be read restrictively. 


In order for a record to fall within the 
scope of section 65(2)(b), it must contain 
the types of information listed in the 
section, it must be in respect of a psychi- 
atric patient and it must have a clinical 
purpose, nature or value. The records 
which the advocates maintain do not 
have a sufficient clinical purpose, nature 
or value to properly fall with the scope of 
section 65(2)(b). 


15 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The more broadly section 65(2)(b) is 
interpreted, the more types of records 
which could contain personal informa- 
tion of individuals other than psychiatric 
patients would be excluded from this 
scope of the Act. It would be inconsistent 
with the underlying principles of the Act 
to interpret section 65(2)(b) in a way 
which would deny psychiatric patients 
the statutory right of access to their own 
personal information contained in records 
which qualify under section 65(2)(b) or 
would create a broad category of records 
which were inaccessible to anyone under 
either the Act or the Mental Health Act. 
Therefore, the PPAO records do not fall 
within the scope of section 65(2)(b) of 
the Act.

The College received a request for access 
to all communications from students to 
the School of Continuing Education in 
the nature ofa complaint and the names 
and addresses of the complainant(s). The 
College did not respond to his request 
within the statutory time frame and was 
deemed to have refused access to the 


16 


requested records as provided in section 


29(4) of the Act. 


During mediation, the College identi- 
fied and disclosed a memo to the appel- 
lant. The College also identified an 
undated handwritten letter received by 
the College from an individual. The 
individual consented to the release of a 
typewritten version of the letter with all 
identifying factors relating to the author 
blacked out. The College then released a 
typewritten transcript of the letter with 
severances relating to the identity of the 
individual. The College denied access to 
the identity of the individual pursuant to 
sections 49(b) and 21 of the Act The 
appellant appealed the College’s decision 
to deny access to the identity of the 
individual and maintained that there 
were other records responsive to his re- 
quest which the College had failed to 
identify. 


ORDER 

The College’s search for responsive 
records was reasonable in the circum- 
stances. The decision of the College 
regarding access was upheld. 


Affidavits from the College described in 
detail the steps taken to locate records 
responsive to the request and confirmed 
that no additional records were found. 


All the information contained in the 
records falls within one or more of para- 
graphs (b), (d), (e) and (h) of the defini- 
tion of personal information under sec- 
tion 2(1) of the Act, and relates to both 
the appellant and the individual. The 
identity of the individual is personal in- 
formation that relates to both the appel- 
lant and the individual. 


The record does not contain any infor- 
mation that relates to the educational 
history of the individual. Therefore, the 


requirements for a presumed unjustified 


invasion of personal privacy under sec- 
tion 21(3)(d) have not been satisfied. 
The College has provided no evidence 
that the individual to whom the informa- 
tion relates will be exposed unfairly to 
pecuniary or other harm (section 
21(2)(e)). The appellant has not pro- 
vided sufficient evidence to support a 
finding that the personal information is 
relevant to a fair determination of rights 
(section 21(2)(d)). No other factors 
under section 21(2) or any other provi- 
sions of the Actapply in favour of disclo- 
sure of the information. The College has 
provided sufficient evidence to establish 
the relevance of section 21(2)(h) in the 
circumstances of this appeal. Accord- 
ingly, the identity of the affected person 
was supplied to the College in confidence 
and, disclosure of the identity of the 
individual would be an unjustified inva- 
sion of his/her privacy.

The College received a request for access 
to all records relating to the College’s 
decision to serve a “Notice: Trespass to 
Property Act” (the Notice) on the re- 
quester. The College denied access to all 
responsive records, except the actual 
Notice, pursuant to sections 19 and 14 of 
the Act. 


ORDER 


The decision of the College was partially 
upheld. 


All of the records contain the personal 
information of the appellant. Informa- 
tion concerning College staff, faculty 
and/or members of the Administration 
of the College was provided by individu- 
als in their professional capacity or the 
execution of employment responsibili- 
ties and is not the personal information 
of these individuals. A letter sent to the 
College by two individuals contains per- 
sonal information of both the appellant 


and the individuals. 


The investigation conducted by the Col- 
lege which led to the issuance of the 
Notice is properly characterized as an 
internal administrative decision which 
does not satisfy the requirements of the 
definition of “law enforcement” con- 
tained in section 2(1). It was not under- 
taken with a view to providing a court or 
tribunal with the facts by which it would 


make a determination of a parties rights. 


Four pieces of correspondence to the 
College from a legal advisor retained by 
the College in the context of its decision 
to issue the Notice, each satisfy the re- 
quirements for exemption under branch 
one of the common law solicitor-client 
exemption: they are written communi- 
cations, of a confidential nature,sent by 
a legal advisor to a client, and directly 
relate to the giving of legal advice. The 
College has properly exercised its discre- 
tion under section 49(a) of the Act. 


None of the factors which would give rise 
toa presumed unjustified invasion of the 
individual’s privacy are relevant consid- 
erations in the context of the record that 
contains the personal information ofboth 


the appellant the individuals. 


Neither the College nor the individuals 
have provided sufficient evidence to es- 
tablish the relevance of section 21(2)(e). 
Some of the parts of the record contain 
“highly sensitive” information, but, sec- 
tion 21(2)(f) is not a relevant considera- 
tion forthe remaining parts of the record. 
The same parts of the record that are 
“highly sensitive” were provided by the 
individuals with an implied expectation 
of confidentiality, therefore, section 
21(2)(h) is a relevant consideration with 
respect to those parts of the record. Sec- 
tion 21(2)(d) is also a relevant considera- 
tion in the circumstances of this appeal. 


Disclosure of the parts of the record 
which were provided to the College im- 
plicitly in confidence and contain highly 
sensitive information concerning the in- 
dividuals would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of those individuals privacy and 
qualify for exemption under section 49(b) 
of the Act. These parts include references 
which would serve to identify the indi- 
viduals. The disclosure of the remaining 
parts of the record would not constitute 
an unjustified invasion of personal pri- 
vacy. The College has properly exercised 
its discretion under section 49(b) as it 
relates to those parts of the record which 
are properly exempt.

The appellant requested access to the 
number of hours each employee worked 
during the month of January, 1991. The 
township denied access to the records 
pursuant to section 14 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The Township’s decision was upheld. 


The record consisted of recorded infor- 
mation about identifiable individuals and 
qualified as personal information. 


Actual hours worked by an employee 
does not fall within the meaning of the 
words “employment history”, and did 
not meet the requirements of section 


14(3)(d). 


Because the Township set theexact hourly 
wage of each employee by a by-law, the 
exact hourly wage was publicknowledge. 
Disclosure of the actual hours worked 
would constitute disclosure of their ac- 
tual income, and such disclosure is pre- 
sumed to be an unjustified invasion of 
personal privacy under section 14(3)(f). 


The records did not contain any infor- 
mation that pertains to section 14(4), 
and section 14(4) did not operate to 
rebut the presumption ‘under section 
14(3)(£). No public demand for scrutiny 
of the activities of the Township had 
been shown, and the right to the infor- 
mation asserted by the appellant was not 
the type of right contemplated by section 
14(2)(d). Accordingly, the presumption 
was not rebutted, and disclosure of the 
record would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy.

The records contained technical, com- 
mercial or financial information. Oneof 
the records was not supplied to the City 
by the company, and the remaining 
records were not supplied in confidence. 
Accordingly, section 10 did not apply.

The appellant requested access to infor-

position under the institution’s proposed 
pay equity plan. The institution denied 
access to the record pursuant to sections 
10 and 11 of the Act. During the course 
of the appeal, the institution indicated 
that it was relying on sections 10(1)(a), 
11(c), (d) and (e) of the Actto deny access 
to the record. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the record. 


The record contained technical informa- 
tion. The institution and the affected 
party failed to establish that the record 
was supplied in confidence. Access pro- 
vided under the Act does not negate 
copyright protection with respect to fur- 
ther use or distribution of the informa- 
tion, and sufficient evidence to establish 
that disclosure of the record would give 
rise to a reasonable expectation that one 
of the types of harms specified in section 
10(1)(a) would occur was not provided. 
Accordingly, section 10 did not apply. 


Disclosure of the record could not rea- 
sonably be expected to prejudice the 
economic interests or the competitive 
position of the institution, because it had 
a process in place for dealing with em- 
ployee concerns about their position 
evaluations, and the institution’s 


employees cannot engage in individual 
bargaining. Accordingly, section 11 did 
not apply.

The appellant requested access to the 
names and addresses of two children 
allegedly involved in a fire which oc- 
curred in Kirkland Lake in September 
1990. The Police denied access to the 
names and addresses of the children pur- 
suant to section 14 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision was upheld. 


Because there was an investigation into a 
possible violation oflaw, section 14(3)(b) 
applied and disclosure of the informa- 
tion would constitute a presumed unjus- 
tified invasion of personal privacy. 


The provisions of section 14(4) were not 
relevant in the circumstances of this ap- 
peal, and therefore did not operate to 
rebut the presumption under section 
14(3)(b). The names and addresses were 
relevant to a fair determination of the 
right of the insurance company which 
retained the appellant to pursue a 
subrogated insurance claim and recover 
losses, but this alone was not sufficient to 


rebut the presumption contained in sec- 
tion 14(3)(b). Accordingly, disclosure of 
the names and addresses of the two chil- 
dren would constitute an unjustified in- 
vasion of personal privacy.

MY report 


The appellant requested access to infor- 
mation pertaining to an investigation of 
threats alleged to have been made by the 
appellant at a meeting which took place 
in a community centre. The Police 
eranted partial access to the record pur- 
suant to sections 8(1)(e), 8(2)(a), 14 and 
38(b) of the Acz. 


ORDER 


The decision of the head was partially 
upheld. 


The record contained personal informa- 
tion of the appellant and another indi- 
vidual. The occurrence number which 
had been severed from the record did not 
qualify as personal information. Because 
there was an investigation into a possible 
violation of law, section 14(3)(b) applied 
and disclosure of the information would 
constitute a presumed unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy. 


The provisions of section 14(4) were not 
relevant in the circumstances of this ap- 
peal, and therefore did not operate to 
rebut the presumption under section 
14(3)(b). None of the factors contained 
in section 14(2) operated to rebut the 
presumption of an unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy. Because disclosure 
of the information would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of the personal pri- 
vacy of another individual, the informa- 
tion qualified for exemption under sec- 


tion 38(b) of the Act 


Disclosure ofan occurrence numberalone 
would not endanger the life or safety of a 
law enforcement office or any other per- 
son and therefore section 8(1)(e) does 
notapply. Further, an occurrencenumber 
alone is nota “report” for the purposes of 
section 8(2)(a).

During the course of the appeal, the

to employees of the City who have been 
investigated or to name the private inves-

The Commissioner disclosed the exist- 
ence of the record and ordered the insti- 
tution to disclose portions of the record. 


The record may not be withheld from 
disclosure pursuant to section 8(1) or 
8(2) of the Act, a condition which must 
be satisfied before the City may even

investigation of the appellant were not

Even if sections 8(1) or 8(2) had applied 
to the record, the fact that the Mayor of 
the City sent a letter to the appellant in 
which she confirmed both the existence 
of a policy regarding the use of private 
investigators and the use of a private 
investigator to conduct a surveillance of 
the appellant does not permit the City to 
argue that disclosure of the existence ofa 
record would relay information to the 
appellant which would compromise the 
effectiveness of a possible law enforce-

The Municipality received a request for 
access to any records relating to the in- 
volvement of the Metropolitan Toronto 


Department of Ambulance Services in 
an incident in which the body of an 
individual was discovered in an apart- 
ment. The Muncipality denied access to 
the record in its entirety pursuant to 
sections 14(1), 14(2)(f), and 14(3)(a) of 
the Act. 


ORDER 
The Municipality’s decision was par- 
tially upheld. 


The record contains recorded informa- 
tion about identifiable individuals, one 
of whom is deceased. Section 2(2) of the 
Act does not apply as the death occurred 
within the past 30 years. The appellant, 
on behalf of the mother of the deceased, 
was not able to exercise the right of access 
to the personal information of the de- 
ceased because he did not demonstrate 
that the mother is the “personal repre- 
sentative” of the deceased and that the 
request for access to information relates 
to the administration of the estate of the 
deceased (section 54(a)). Therefore, the 
appellant’s request for information as it 
relates to the personal information of the 
deceased and other identifiable indivi- 
duals must be dealt with under section 


14 of the Act. 


No presumption of an unjustified inva- 
sion of the personal privacy of the de- 
ceased existed pursuant to section 


14(3)(a). 


Although section 14(2) of the Actidenti- 
fies some factors that may be relevant in 
determining whether disclosure of infor- 
mation would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy, thelist found 
in 14(2) is not exhaustive. One unlisted 
factor is that one of the individuals whose 
personal information is at issue is de- 
ceased. Although the personal informa- 
tion ofa deceased individual remains that 
person’s personal information until 30 


years after his/her death, upon the death

ofan individual, the privacy interest asso- 
ciated with the personal information of 
the deceased individual diminishes. In- 
formation which might have constituted 
an unjustified invasion of personal pri- 
vacy while a person was alive, may, in 
certain circumstances, not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy if 
the person is deceased. In the circum- 
stances of this appeal, the disclosure of 
the personal information of the deceased 
to the appellant would not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of the personal pri- 
vacy of the deceased. Disclosure of the 
personal information of individuals other 
than the deceased would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of their personal pri- 


vacy.

14(2)(f), and 14(3)(a) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The City’s decision was not upheld.

The record contains recorded informa- 
tion about an identifiable individual, the 
deceased. Section 2(2) of the Act does 
not apply as the death occurred within 
the past 30 years. The appellant, on 
behalfof the mother of the deceased, was 
not able to exercise the right of access to 
the personal information of the deceased 
because he did not demonstrate that the 
mother is the “personal representative” 
of the deceased and that the request for 
access to information relates to the ad- 
ministration of the estate of the deceased 


(section 54(a)). Therefore, the appel- — 


lant’s requests for informationas it relates 
to the personal information of the de- 
ceased must be dealt with under section 


14 of the Act. 


No presumption of an unjustified inva- 
sion of the personal privacy of the de- 
ceased existed pursuant to section 


14(3)(a). 


Although section 14(2) of the Actidenti- 
fies some factors that may be relevant in 
determining whether disclosure of infor- 
mation would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy, thelist found 
in 14(2) is not exhaustive. One unlisted 
factor is that the individual whose per- 


sonal information is at issue is deceased. _ 


Although the personal information of a 
deceased individual remains that per- 
son’s personal information until 30 years 
after his/her death, upon the death of an 
individual, the privacy interest associated 
with the personal information of the 
deceased individual diminishes. Infor- 
mation which might have constituted an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
while a person was alive, may, in certain 
circumstances, not constitute an unjusti- 
fied invasion of personal privacy if the 
person is deceased. In the circumstances 
of this appeal, the disclosure of the per- 
sonal information of the deceased to the 
appellant would not constitute an unjus- 


tified invasion of the personal privacy of 
the deceased.

The Police received a request for access to 
the reports and statements concerning a 
charge of first degree murder. The Police 
identified the record which responded to 
the request as consisting of three groups 
of information: a “Crown Brief’ and 
covering letter; pages from two police 
officers’ notebooks and information sent 
by the appellant to the Ministry of the 
Solicitor General. The Police granted 
partial access to the police officers’ note- 
books. Access to the remainder of the 
information was denied, either in whole 
or in part, pursuant to section 8(2)(a), 


9(1)(b), 15(a), 12 and 38(a) and (b) of — 


the Act. During mediation, the Police 
withdrew their claim for exemption pur- 
suant to section 15(a) and 9(1)(b) of the 
Actand released a number of pages to the 
appellant. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Police was partially 
upheld. 


Some portions of the record contained 
personal information of the appellant

only. The remaining pages contained 
the personal information of theappellant 


and other individuals. 


With regard to the personal information 
of the appellant, section 8(2)(a) applies 
only to the “Alcohol Influence Test Re- 
port” contained in the “Crown Brief”. 
Section 8(2)(a) does not apply to the 
remaining pages of the “Crown Brief” as 
neither the brief as a whole nor the 
individual pages meet the definition of 
“report”. Section 12 does not apply to 
these pages as the relationship between 


the Police and the Crown Attorney is not 


that of solicitor and client. Therefore, to 
section 38(a) of the Act can not apply. 


With regard to the portion of the record 
which contains the personal information 
of both the appellant and other individu- 
als, section 38(b) of the Act introduces 
the balancing principle. The names, 
address and statements of individuals 
other than the appellant are personal 
information which was compiled as part 
of an investigation into a possible viola- 
tion of law. Accordingly, the require- 
ments for a presumed unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy under section 


14(3)(b) have been satisifed. 


The record does not contain any infor- 
mation that pertains to section 14(4). In 
an unusual case, a combination of cir- 
cumstances set out in section 14(2) might 
be so compelling as to outweigh pre- 
sumption under section 14(3). How- 
ever, such a case would be extremely 
~ unusual. The presumption in section 
14(3) has not been rebutted with the 
exception of one page. The individual 
_ whose personal information is contained 
_ inthis pageconsented to the disclosure of 
_ theinformation, therefore, the presump- 
tion found in section 14(3)(b) does not 


| apply.

record subject to court order ¢ jurisdiction

The record at issue in these appeals is an 
investigation report concerning the 
Windsor Board of Education which was 
prepared by the Windsor Police as a 
result of an investigation conducted in 


1989 and 1990. 


There are nine appeals, involving four 
appellants and two requesters, in which 
disclosure of this record is at issue. 


During the course of processing the ap- 
peals, the Commissioner’s Office was 
notified by one of the parties of the 
existence of two orders of the Ontario 
Court (General Division) which restrict 
disclosure and dissemination of the record 
to the parties to a court action and their 
counsel, to the extent necessary for the 
preparation for trial. 


The sole issue is the effect, if any, of the 
two court orders on the Commissioner's 
authority to review the decisions made 
under the Act by the Police. 


ORDER 
The Commissioner ordered that the ap- 
peals be discontinued and the appeal files 


closed. 


Persons who are not parties to, but have 
knowledge of an injunctive order must 
obey the order. The court orders are 
injunctive. 


The Commissioner’s jurisdiction to re- 
view the decisions of the Police, which is 
derived from the Municipal Freedom of 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 
is not effected by the court orders. How- 
ever, in practical terms, the court orders 
restrict how the appeals may be pro- 
cessed. To order partial or full disclosure 
of the record or to refer to the record may 
well constitute contempt of court. No 
practical purpose would be served in 
proceeding with these appeals at this 


time.

The Police received a request for all infor- 
mation relating to the requester. After 
notifying two individuals whose personal 
information might be contained in the 
record, the Police decided to exercise 
discretion under section 38(b) and

release the records relating to the two 
individuals. The two individuals appealed 
the decision to release the records relating 
to them. 


ORDER 
The decision of the head was upheld. 


Although the presumption raised by sec- 
tion 14(3)(b) applies and disclosure of 
the information would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of the privacy of the 
appellants, section 38(b) gives the Police 
the discretion to grant or deny access to 
the requester. 


The Police provided representations re- 
garding their exercise of discretion to 
disclose the information at issue. The 
Commissioner found nothing to indi- 
cate that the exercise of discretion was 
improper. 


Section 38 is a discretionary exemption 
and even if, as in this case, the disclosure 
of the information would be an unjusti- 
fied invasion of another individuals pri- 
vacy, discretion can be exercised in fa- 
vour of disclosure. The availability of 
discretion under section 38 is consistent 
with one of the purposes of the Act which 
is to provide individuals with a right of 
access to their own information.

Theappellant requested access to records 
related toastone throwing incident which 
occurred at a school in Brampton in 


October 1991. 


During the course of the appeal, the: 


appellant narrowed his request to the 
namesand addresses of the child who was 
alleged to have thrown the stone and the 
children who are reported to have wit- 
nessed the incident. The institution 
denied access to the information pursu- 
ant to section 14 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the head was partially 
upheld. 


The names and addresses of the three 
children do not fall within any of the 
types of information listed in section 
14(3). Therefore, no presumption ofan 
unjustified invasion of the childrens’ per- 
sonal privacy exists. 


None of the parties provided sufficient 
evidence to establish the requirements of 
section 14(2)(h), 14(2)(f), 14(2)(g) or 
14(2)(i) to the record. 


In the circumstances of this appeal, the 
appellant has established that section 
14(2)(d) is a relevant consideration but 
only with respect to the name of the child 
who allegedly threw the stone. The 
appellant hasa legal right toadd this child 
as a party to an existing civil action and 
the child’s name is required to do so.

The City of Toronto received a request 
for records pertaining to property-re- 
lated disputes between the requester and 
the owner of an adjoining property. 


Partial access was granted. Access to the 
remaining information was denied pur- 
suant to sections 12 and 14 of the Act. In 
the course of the appeal, the City with- 
drew reliance on the section 12 exemp- 
tion and indicated that the records were 
being denied under sections 14(1)(f), 
14(3)(b) and 38(b) of the Act The 
appellant agreed to narrow his request to 
correspondence between the City and 
the solicitor for the owner of the adjoin- 


ing property. 


ORDER 
The City’s decision was partially upheld. 


All of the information contained in the 
records falls within the definition of per- 
sonal information under section 2(1) of 
the Actand relates to both the appellant 
and the owner of the adjoining property. 
The records do not contain personal 
information of the solicitor who was 
acting solely in his capacity as the 


representative of the owner of the 


adjoining property. 


The City failed to establish that a pre- 
sumed unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy exists under section 14(3) of the 
Act. However, section 14(2)(h) is a 
relevant factor in the circumstances of 
this appeal. When a lawyer retained by 
an individual in relation to by-law mat- 
ters sends correspondence to an institu- 
tion in which he discusses his clients 
position and explores settlement possi- 
bilities, it is reasonable to assume that 
such personal information is supplied 
implicitly in confidence. Therefore, the 
disclosure of this type of personal infor- 
mation would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of the personal privacy of the 
owner of the adjoining property and the 
records qualify for exemption under sec- 


tion 38(b) of the Act. 


Letters sent by the city surveyor, the 
arbitrator appointed by the City, were 
not supplied to the City in confidence. 
Therefore, section 14(2)(h) is not a rel- 
evant consideration. As well, none of the 
other factors under section 14(2) that 
favour non-disclosure are present. Ac- 
cordingly, disclosure of this information 
would not constitute an unjustified inva- 
sion of the personal privacy of the owner 
of the adjoining property and should be 


disclosed. 


Section 38(b) is a discretionary exemp- 
tion. There is nothing to indicate that 
the exercise of discretion was improper.

The Police received a request for access to 
an investigation file, including the names 
of the Officers participating in the inves- 
tigation as well as the names of people 
questioned and the use of any covert 
techniques (i.e. electronics surveillance). 
The Police responded by advising the 
requester that the existence of any records 
could neither be confirmed nor denied in 
accordance with section 8(3) of the Act. 


ORDER 

The doctrine of federal legislative para- 
mountcy operates to exclude requests for 
wiretap application records from thescope 
of the Municipal Act. Non-wiretap 
investigation records do not exist. 


The representations provided by the 
Police, as they relate to non-wiretap in- 
vestigation records, contain what could 
be best described as generalized refer- 
ences to possible interference with the 
investigative process. The Police do not 
provide details as to how disclosure of the 
existence of non-wiretap investigative 
records would “frustrate” an ongoing 
investigation, either in the abstract or, 
more importantly, in the particular cir- 
cumstances of this appeal. Therefore, the 
Police have not established that any of 
the circumstances enumerated in sec- 
tions 8(1) or (2) exist in the circum- 
stances of the appellant’s request and 
section 8(3) of the Act does not apply.

The appellant requested a copy of the 
entire correspondenceand inspection files 
and any other correspondence in posses- 
sion of the Fire Department regarding a 
named address, including the dates and 
times that a named Fire Prevention Of 
ficer inspected and visited the address. 


The City responded by releasing 14 
records. The requester was not satisfied 
with this response and appealed the City’s 
decision, claiming that additional re- 
sponse of records should exist. 


The City issued a second decision letter 
denying access to the records pursuant to 
section 8 and section 12. The City also 
refused to confirm or deny the existence 
of additional records. 


During the course of the appeal the City 
withdrew its reliance on section 8(3) and 
agreed to release additional records. The 
scope of the appeal was narrowed to only 
one of the 22 records originally identified 
by the City. The only exemption claimed 
by the City with respect to this one record 
was section 12 of the Act. 


28 


However, the appellant continued to 
maintainadditional records existed. That 
records such as Fire Prevention Officer’s 
notes and diary entries should have been 
identified as responsive to his request. 
The City took the position that the Fire 
Prevention Officer’s notes and diary en- 
tries do exist but they are neither respon- 
sive to the appellants request nor in the 
City’s custody and/or control. The City 
also maintained that additional records 
identified by the appellant could not be 
located and asked for an opportunity to 
present “viva voce” evidence on the issues 
ofthe notes and diary entries as well as the 
possible existence of additional records. 
The City also submitted that the Infor- 
mation and Privacy Commissioner did 
not have jurisdiction to deal with “law 
enforcement documents”. 


ORDER 

The City was ordered to disclose the one 
record at issue to the appellant. The City 
was also ordered to provide the appellant 
with the proper decision letter regarding 
access to the notes and diary entries of the 
Fire Prevention Officer. The City was 
also ordered to provide affidavit evidence 
attesting to the records which were re- 
leased to the appellant during the course 
of responding to his request and appeal 
and the nature of the search is conducted 
to determine whether additional respon- 
sive records exist. 


The one record at issue does not qualify 
for exemption under the second part of 
the section 12 exemption as it clearly has 
not been used in giving legal advice or in 
contemplation of litigation. 


Section 8 of the Municipal Act deals with 
so called “law enforcement” records. In 
general, this section provides institutions 
with discretion to exempt a record if the 
matter which generated the record satis- 
fies the definition of the term “law en- 
forcement” found in section 2(1) of the 


Act and the requirements of one of the 
enumerated situations outlined in sec- 
tions 8(1) or (2) is present. Ifa record has 
been exempted by an institution under 
section 8 and the institution has exer- 
cised its discretion not to disclose the 
record, the requester has the right to 
appeal that decision to the Commis- 
sioner. Because the City provided de- 
tailed written representations outlining 
why it believes that the notes and diary 
entries the Fire Prevention Officers are 
not in its custody and control, it was not 
necessary to hear oral representations on 
this issue. 


The most appropriate method of ad- 
dressing the issue of additional records is 
for the City to provide an affidavit by the 
head ora delegate of the head attesting to 
the records released to the appellant dur- 
ing the course of responding to his re- 
quest and appeal and to the search is 
undertaken by the City in order to deter- 
mine whether any additional responsive 
records exist. This is the normal proce- 
dure followed by the Commissioner's 
Office in dealing with issues relating to 
adequacy of searches for records. Once 
the affidavit is received, the Assistant 
Commissioner will determine whether 
the affidavit is adequate and whether oral 


repr esentations are necessaly. 


The notes and diary entries of the Fire 
Prevention Officers are clearly related to 
their employment responsibilities and 
are properly considered to be in the 
custody or under the control of the City. 
These records relate to the properties 
being inspected by the Officers and clearly 
would only have been created as part of 
the Officers employment related respon- 
sibilities.

record. 


ORDER 
The Town’s decision was partially up-

None of the exceptions listed in section

The Commissioner reviewed the record 
witha view to determining whether there 
could be a compelling public interest in 
disclosure which clearly outweighs the

appeal, the Commissioner was not con- 
vinced that a compelling public interest 


in the disclosure of the one sentence 


exists.

Police decided to release to the requester 
certain information contained in the

notified an individual whose interests 
might be affected by the release of the 
reportand after receiving representations 
from this person, decided to grant partial 
access to the requester. The individual 
who had been notified appealed the de- 


cision to grant partial access. 


30 


ORDER 
The decision of the Police to provide 
partial access was upheld. 


Because parts of the record do not con- 
tain personal information and no other 
exemptions were claimed, these parts 
should be released to the requester. Some 
parts of the remaining information con- 
tain the personal information of the re- 
quester only while other parts contain the 
personal information of both the re- 
quester and the appellant. 


Because part of the record contains the 
personal information of the requester 
only, disclosure of this information can- 
not constitute an unjustified invasion of 
the appellant’s personal privacy and sec- 
tion 38(b) does notapply. These parts of 
the record should be released to the re- 
quester. 


Section 38(b) introduces the balancing 
principle with regards to those portions 
of the record which contain the personal 
information of both the requester and 
the appellant. The requirements for a 
presumed unjustified invasion of the 
appellant’s personal privacy under sec- 
tion 14(3)(b) have been established. The 
records do not contain any information 
that pertains to section 14(4). Section 
14(2)(d) alone, which was raised by the 
requester, is not sufficient to rebut the 
presumption in section 14(3)(b). How- 


ever, section 38(b) is a discretionary ex- 


emption which gives the Police discre- 
tion to grant access to a record even if 
doing so would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of another individual’s personal 
privacy. This is what the Police have 
chosen to do in this case and is nothing to 
indicate that the exercise of discretion 
was improper.

The Town received a request for access to 
a copy of a complete report submitted to 
town council by a named individual. 
The Town denied access to the record 
claiming sections 6(1)(b) of the Act. 
During the course of the appeal, the 
Town added section 14 as a new exemp- 
tion with respect to certain portions of 
the record. 


ORDER 
The Town’s decision was upheld. 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 6(1)(b), the Town must establish 
that (1) a meeting of a council, board, 
commission or other body or a commit- 
tee of one of them took place; and (2) that 
a statute authorizes the holding of this 
meeting in the absence of the public; and 
(3) that disclosure of the record at issue 
would reveal the actual substance of de-

A meeting of the committee of the whole 
Town Council was held on December 4, 
1991. Section 55(1) ofthe Municipal Act

matter of the record had been considered

6(2)(b) did notapply. Because the record 
contains the appellants personal infor-

with discretion to refuse to disclose to the 
appellant his own personal information

The Board received a request for access to 
a proposal that was developed in con- 


junction with Apple Canada for an ad- 


vanced technology secondary school. 


The Board denied access to the record 
pursuant to section 10(1)(a) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The Board was ordered to disclose the 
records to the appellant. 


The records area four page record which 
outlines the conceptual framework for 
the developmentofa possible projectand 


a one page “letter of intent” signed by 
representatives of the Board and Apple 
Canada. In its representations, Apple 
Canada indicated it was willing to release 
the letter of intent. 


The information contained in the records 
does not qualify as trade secrets. The 
connection between the information 
contained in the records and the com- 
mercial activities of Apple Canada is too 
remote to qualify the information as 
commercial. Therefore, the information 
contained in the records does not qualify 
as any of the types of information identi- 
fied in section 10(1). 


The information contained in the records 
was a result of negotiations between the 
Board and Apple Canada. Various infor- 
mation may have been supplied by Apple 
Canada to the Board during the course of 
negotiations. Because it is not possible to 
distinguish which portion of the record 
reveals information that was supplied to 
the Board, which information is that of 
the Board and which information re- 
flects an amalgam of the position of both 
parties, the records were not “supplied” 
as is required by section 10(1). 


There is no evidence to establish a reason- 
able expectation of significant prejudice 
to its competitive position if the letter of 
intent is disclosed. Neither the Board 
nor Apple Canada have provided suffi- 
cient evidence to establish a reasonable 
expectation of significant prejudice to 
Apple Canada’s competitive position 
should the other record by released. 
Therefore, neither of the two records 
meets the test for exemption under sec- 
tion 10(1)(a) of the Actand they do not 
qualify for exemption.

The Ontario Provincial Police (the OPP) 
investigated a house fire and took photo- 
graphs of the fire scene. Later, the OPP 
gave copies of the photographs to an 
insurance investigator. The owner of the 
house complained that his privacy was 
breached because the OPP disclosed his 
personal information when they talked 
to the investigator and gave him copies of 


the photographs. 


CONCLUSION 
The IPC found that the OPP had used 
the photographs to explain the fire to the 


_ investigator. 


The IPC concluded that the discussions 
about the fire and the photographs of the 
fire scene were not “recorded informa- 
tion about an identifiable individual”. 
Therefore, they were not the house own- 


er’s “personal information” as defined in 
section 2(1) of the Act. 


Since the information was not personal 
information, the privacy provisions of 
Part II] of the Actdid notapply. The IPC 
concluded that the OPP did not disclose 


information contrary to Part III of the

An employee of an institute of the Min- 
istry complained that on two separate 
occasions, the institute had improperly 
disclosed his personal information as fol- 
lows: 


1. The complainant had frequently been 
absent from work. He had voluntarily 
provided letters from two psychiatrists 
and a psychologist to explain his ab- 
sences. Later, the institute asked the 
complainant to submit to a mandatory 
medical exam under the terms of his 
collective agreement. The institute for- 
warded copies of the letters to the physi- 
cian selected to do the exam. 


2.The complainant had filed a workers’ 
compensation claim for benefits. At the 
Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) 
hearing into his claim, a Human Re- 
sources Manager at the institute, testify- 
ing under oath, disclosed medical infor- 
mation about him. 


CONCLUSIONS 

1. The complainant had given the letters 
to explain his frequent absences. Later, 
he was required to undergo a mandatory 
medical exam because of these absences.

In forwarding copies of the letters to the 
examining doctor, the institute disclosed 
personal information for a purpose con- 
sistent with the purpose for which the 
information had been obtained and one 
which the complainant could have rea- 
sonably expected. Thus, the disclosure 
was in accordance with sections 42(c) 


and 43 of the Act. 


2. The Human Resources Manager dis- 
closed the complainant’s medical infor- 
mation at a WCB tribunal. The IPC 
determined that the WCB has the statu- 
tory power to compel a witness to testify 
at a WCB hearing. Section 64(2) of the 
Actstates that the Act does not affect this 
power. Therefore, the disclosure of the 
complainant’s medical information was 
permitted under the provisions of the 


Act. 


Other matters: 

During the course of the investigation, 
the IPC found that the institute had 
collected personal information without 
giving notice as required by the Act. 


The IPC recommended that when the 
institute collected personal information, 
it should ensure that proper notice was 
given.

The IPC learned that the Ontario Lot- 
tery Corporation (OLC) was collecting 
and using Social Insurance (SIN) and 
Ontario Health Card numbers to verify 
the identity of prize winners who re- 


deemed their tickets in person at the 
OLC’s prize offices. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC examined the respective federal 
and provincial legislation governing the 
collection and use of the SIN and Health 
Card Number. It determined that the 
OLC had no legal authority to collect or 
use either number in its prize redemption 
process. This practice was an infringe- 
ment of the privacy provisions of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC brought this matter to the 
attention of the OLC with a recommen-

cedures so as to comply with the Act. 


The OLC responded positively to the 


recommendation by deciding that its

An individual was not satisfied with how 
her insurance company had handled her 
claim. She complained to the Office of 
the Superintendent of Insurance about 
it. She next complained to the Ontario 
Insurance Commission (OIC) about how 
the Superintendent of Insurance had 
handled her complaint. 


The OIC investigated her complaints, 
wrotea report, (the OIC report) and sent 
a copy of it to a private actuarial firm. 
The individual found out that the OIC 
had given a copy of the OlC report to the 
actuarial firm. She believed that her 
medical records had also been given to 
the firm. She complained that her pri- 
vacy had been breached because the OIC 
report and the medical records had been 
given to the firm without her knowledge 
or consent. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the OIC had not 
given the complainant’s medical records 
to theactuarial firm. The IPC also found 
thatthe OIC had changed the complain- 
ant’s name to “Jane Doe” in the OIC 
report before giving it to the firm. 


The IPC concluded that the OIC report 
did not contain “recorded information 
aboutan identifiable individual”. There- 
fore, the report did not contain “personal 
information” as defined in section 2(1) of 
the Act. Since the information was not

The Clerk-Administrator ofa Township 
asked the Ontario Provincial Police (the 
OPP) to patrol the Township adminis- 
tration office, during an evening meeting 
of the Township Council. Some time 
later, the OPP received a request, under 
the Act. The requester asked for details of 
the Township’s request for OPP assist- 
ance, including the name of the person 
who had made the request. The OPP 
responded to the request, by releasing the 
name of the Clerk-Administrator and 
details of her request for OPP assistance. 
The Clerk-Administrator complained 
that the OPP had wrongly disclosed her 


name. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that when the complain- 
ant had asked the OPP for assistance, she 
had done so in her capacity as the Clerk- 
Administrator. The IPC, therefore, con- 
cluded that the information released did 
not constitute the complainant’s “per- 
sonal information”, as that term is de- 
fined in section 2(1) of the Act, because it 
was information relating to the com- 
plainant in her work-related capacity. 
Therefore, Part III of the Act did not

The Town received 38 access requests, 
over a period of several months. The 
complainant had filed ten of them. To 
account for the amount of time that 
processing these requests was requiring, 
the Town’s Freedom of Information 
and Privacy Co-ordinator sent a memo 
to the Town’s Mayor and members of 
council. The Co-ordinator had attached 
to his memo each of the 38 access re- 
quests, and his responses to them. Some 
time later, the same complainant started 
a court action against one of the Town’s 
councillors. Thecouncillor’s lawyer tried 
to introduce the Co-ordinator’s memo 
and the complainant’s access requests as 
evidence in that court proceeding. 


The complainant complained that the 
Town had wrongly disclosed his access 
requests to the Mayor and members of 
council and to the Court. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the complainant's 
access requests contained his “personal 
information”, as defined in section 2(1) 


of the Act. 


The IPC also found that the Town was 
not permitted to disclose the complain- 
ant’s access requests to the Mayor and 
members of council, under section 32 of 


the Act. 


The IPC further concluded that the 
Mayor and members of council did not 
need to know the identity of the request- 
ers in order to understand how long it 
was taking to process these access re- 


quests. Thus, the IPC found that the 
Town did not comply with section 3(2) 
of Ontario Regulation 517/90, which 
requires that only those individuals who 
need a record in the performance of their 
duties shall have access to it. 


The IPC determined that the presenta- 
tion of the memo and the complainant’s 
access requests to the Court was a “use” 
instead of a “disclosure”, under the Act. 
TheIPC found that section 31 of the Act, 
which addresses “use”, did not apply in 
this case, because the memo and the 
complainant's access requests were used 
not by the Town, but rather, by the 
councillor who, by virtue of his role as 
councillor, was distinct from the Town. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Town 
not disclose any “personal information”, 
as defined in section 2(1) of the Act, 
unless permitted by section 32 of the Act.

3 grievance. The information disclosed 
in both meetings was recorded in min- 
utes available to the public. The teacher 
complained that the Board had disclosed 


his personal information. 


The Board stated that it had disclosed 
the complainant’s personal information 
pursuant to section 32(e) of the Act. 
Section 32(e) states that an institution 
shall not disclose personal information 
except for the purpose of complying with 
an act of the Legislature. In relying on 
this section, the Board referred the IPC 
to the Education Act. 


The IPC reviewed the relevant sections 
of the Education Act. The IPC concluded 
that the Board could not rely on section 
32(e) of the Act because the word “com- 
plying” in section 32(e) of the Act indi- 
cates that the statute in question must be 
mandatory in nature. In other words, in 
order for section 32(e) to apply here, the 
Education Act must impose a duty on the 
Board to disclose the information. A 
provision which grants an institution the 
discretion to disclose personal informa- 
tion would not be sufficient for section 


32(e) of the Act to apply. 


CONCLUSION 
The IPC concluded that the Board had 


not complied with the privacy provisions 


of Part II of the Act, 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Board 
not discuss personal information in open 
meetings.

An individual was taking part in the 
Municipality’s parental support program. 
The program’s files contained her tel- 
ephone number. Her program worker 
gave this number to another person in 
the program, without the individual’s 
consent. She complained that this was a 
breach of her privacy and contrary to the 
Act. 


CONCLUSION 


The IPC found that the complainant 


had not consented to having her pro- 
gram worker disclose her telephone 
number to another person in the pro- 
gram. She had not identified this tel- 
ephone number in particular or con- 
sented to it being given out, though her 
program worker assumed that she had. 


The Municipality stated that it was per- 
mitted to disclose the telephone number 
under section 32(c) of the Act, which 
allows a disclosure that is consistent with 
the purpose for which the information 
was obtained. However, the IPC found 
that disclosing the telephone number 
was not permitted under section 32(c) of 
the Act because the Municipality ob- 
tained the telephone number so that the 
complainant's program worker could 
contact her during the course of her 
involvement with the parental support 
program, not so that he could give it to 
others. Consequently, the disclosure of 
the telephone number was contrary to 


the Act.

Four individuals complained that the 
School Board, their employer, had im- 
properly disclosed information about 
theiremployment income. According to 
the complainants, disclosures were made 
as follows: (1) two different newspapers 
on two separate dates reported that a 
school trustee had disclosed information 
concerning the specific salaries of the 
individuals; (2) in another newspaper 
article, unspecified sources disclosed the 
average percentagesalary increase received 
by the complainants, and (3) in a fourth 
article, another school trusteecommented 
onthecomplainants’ decision not to take 
a rollback in their salaries. 


CONCLUSION 

(1) Inreply tothe IPC inquiry on the first 
two disclosures, the school trustee denied 
that she had disclosed any information 
concerning the complainants’ income. 
The IPC, therefore, could only conclude 
that if the school trustee had, in fact, 
disclosed the information, then it was 
disclosed contrary to section 32 of the Act 


which outlines the circumstances per- - 
_ mitting disclosure. 


With respect to the other disclosures, the 
IPC concluded that: 


_ (2) Anaverage percentage salary increase 
could not be considered to be the specific 
_ information ofany identifiable individual 
_and therefore, this information was not 
_ “personal information” as defined in the 


| Act. 


(3) Since it appeared that the School 


Board did not have a record of the com- 
plainants’ decision not to take a rollback 
in their salaries, this information was not 
recorded information and, therefore, was 
also not “personal information” as de- 


fined in the Act.

The City was collecting medical infor- 
mation from its employees via long-term 
disability forms (forms). The City then 
forwarded the forms to the insuring 
agency. An employee complained that 
this breached employees’ privacy, in con- 
travention of the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the insuring 
agency paid disability benefits directly to 
the employees concerned. The City 
could not provide any authority to col- 
lect the forms. The City agreed to stop 
this practice, and to destroy all copies of 
the forms held on file. 


The City’s co-operation facilitated early 
settlement of this complaint. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that the City: 


* immediately stop collecting the forms 
from its employees; 

* provide written notice to employees to 
deal directly with the insuring agent; and 
* provide written notice to employees 
that all forms currently in their posses- 
sion will shortly be destroyed.

A teacher had a medical problem that 
affected her work. The school principal 
wrote several memos about the teacher 
and later passed them on to his supervi- 
sor. The memos were also passed on to 
some other employees and the Board’s 
doctor. The teacher complained that her 
privacy was breached because she had 
told the principal about her medical prob- 
lem in confidence. She also believed her 
privacy was breached because the memos 
were collected without her knowledge or 
consent and then passed on to others. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the memos had been 
collected by the principal and passed on 
to others in 1989. Since this happened 
before the Actcame into effect, the com- 
plaint fell outside the Commissioner’s 
jurisdiction.

personinfo * retention 


A former employee of the Police Force 
found out that the Force still had his 
fingerprintsand photograph on file, more 
than one year after he had left. He asked 
the IPC if this contravened the Act. 


The complainant also complained to the 
Force, asking them to delete his personal 
records from all data bases and record 
storage. 


. CONCLUSION 


Prior to our investigation, the complain- 
ant received a satisfactory response from 
the Police Force concerning the data 
bases and record storage. His one re- 
maining concern was whether the reten- 
tion of his fingerprints and photograph 
on microfilm complied with the Act. 


The IPC reviewed the Police Force’s 
retention schedules, and determined that 
retention of the records on microfilm 
complied with Ontario Regulation 517/ 
90 of the Act. The Regulation specifies 
only a minimum retention period, not a 
maximum period.

formed the individual that any records 
containing his personal information were 
destroyed in accordance with the insti- 
tution’s retention schedule and that 
access to records containing the personal 
information of the wards was denied 
pursuant to sections 45(1)(e) and (f) of 
the Young Offenders Act(the YOA). Each 
of the four requesters appealed the 
Ministry’s decision to deny access. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to provide a 
detailed affidavit, sworn by an official of 
the Ministry, relating each record to the 
provisions of the YOA and demonstrat- 
ing how the required elements of each 
provision are satisfied. 


The Ministry refused to provide the 
Commissioner's Office with a copy of 
the records for all four appeals, claiming 
that to do so would offend the disclosure 
provisions of the YOA. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The YOA contains a number of provi- 
sions relating to the keeping and disclo- 
sure of records. Where valid federal 
legislation is inconsistent with or con- 
flicts with valid provincial legislation, 
the federal legislation prevails to the 
extent of the inconsistency or conflict. 
The inconsistency must amount an “ex- 
press contradiction”. There is an ex- 
pressed contradiction between the dis- 
closure provisions of the Act and the 
YOA. Section 45(1) of the YOA states 
that, in certain circumstances, a record 
kept pursuant to section 43 of that stat- 
ute may not be made available for 
inspection under section 44.1, except 
where the record is in the custody or 
control of the national archivist or an 
archivist for any province, or by way of 
an application to a youth court judge. 


There is also an express contradiction 
between the two statutes as it relates to 
the Commissioner's right to require pro- 
duction of records for consideration 
during the course of an appeal. Sections 
46(1) and 43 of the YOA clearly conflict 
with section 52(4) of the Act. Therefore, 
there is an expressed contradiction be- 
tween the disclosure scheme contained 
in the YOAand the disclosure scheme in 
the Act and, in accordance with the 
doctrine of federal legislative para- 
mountcy, the YOA prevails in respect to 
records kept by a provincial institution 
pursuant to section 43 of the YOA. 
Because section 45(6) of the YOA pro- 
vides that records relating to the offence 
of delinquency under the /uvenile Delin- 
quency Act(the /DA) fall under the YOA, 
the records relating to the offence of 
delinquency also fall outside the scope of 
the Act. 


However, the Information and Privacy 
Commissioner has both the jurisdiction 
and the statutory obligation to deter- 
mine whether the Act applies to records 
in the custody or under the control of 


any institution covered by the Act. The 
Commissioner must assess, as best he 
can, that records are not improperly 
withheld from scrutiny under the Act on 
the basis that they are “YOA records” 


when, in fact, this may not be the case. 


Section 45 of the YOA, by operation of 
section 45(6), applies in respect of all 
records relating to the offence of delin- 
quency under the /DA and makes no 


distinction as to when the records are 


created. As long as the records relate to , 


the offence of delinquency under the 
JDA, they fall under the scope of the 
YOA, regardless of whether the records 
were created before or after the wards 
were committed to Grandview. Section 
46 of the YOA makes it an offence to 
disclose any such records or any infor- 
mation contained in them to any person 
“... where to do so would serve to identify 
the young person to whom it relates as a 
young person dealt with under [the 
YOA]”. This provision applies whether 
or not the person requesting the records 
or the person to whom the records are to 
be disclosed is aware that the person to 
whom the information relates is a young 


person dealt with under the YOA. 


Section 45 of the YOA does not permit 
the disclosure by the Ministry of records 
relating to the offence of delinquency to 
the Information and Privacy Commis- 
sioner, in the absence of an order of a 


Youth Court Judge. 


The Assistant Commissioner was not 
satisfied that the records which are the 
subject matter of the four requests “relate 
to the offence of delinquency” under the 
JDAand, therefore, fall within the scope 
of the YOA and outside the jurisdiction 
of the Act. In order to qualify for consid- 
eration as YOArecords, the records iden- 
tified by the Ministry as being responsive 
to the request must relate to the offence 
of delinquency or disclose information 


which would serve to identify someone 
as the person dealt with under the YOA 
or the /DA.

The Ministry received a request for ac- 
cess to three specified records. The 
Ministry granted partial access to each 
record with severances made pursuant to 
sections 14(1)(b), 19 and 21(1) of the 
Act. During mediation, the appellant 
agreed not to pursue access to the record 
for which section 21(1) was claimed. In 
addition, the Ministry agreed to grant 
access to the record for which section 


14(1)(b) was claimed. The record re- -

memorandum from the Assistant 
Director of the Ministry Psychiatric 
Hospitals Branch to the Administrator 
and the Assistant Administrator of the 
Penetanguishene Mental Health

the first part of Branch one of the section 
19 exemption (common law solicitor-

The record was not created or obtained 
especially for a lawyer's brief for existing 
or contemplated litigation but rather to 
communicate information between Min- 
istry’s administration staff. Therefore, 
the record does not qualify under the 
second part of Branch one of the exemp- 
tion (litigation privilege) and section 19 


of the Act dogs not apply to the record.

employment information ®° salaries 

* benefits * economic or other interests 
* personal information * unjustified

The Board received a request for access to 
information respecting the salary and 
benefits of its Chief Executive Officer 
(the CEO), and Senior Vice President of 
Investments (the Senior VP). The re- 
quest was subsequently modified to in- 
clude only salary ranges for these posi- 
tions, provided that the salary ranges 
were not excessively broad. The Board 
denied access to the salary ranges and 
benefits pursuant to sections 21(1) and 


18(1)(c) of the Act. 


ORDER 

The Board was ordered to disclose the 
portions of the record which contain the 
salary ranges and benefits entitlements of 


the CEO and the Senior VP. 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 18(1)(c), the Board must provide 
detailed and convincing evidence that 
disclosure of the information contained 
in the records could reasonably be ex- 
pected to prejudice the economic interest 
or competitive position of the Board. 
The expectation must not be fanciful, 
imaginary or contrived, but rather one 
that is based on reason. The evidence 
submitted in support of the Board’s claim 
is speculative and not sufficient to estab- 
lish a reasonable expectation of prejudice 
to the economic interest or competitive 
position of the Board. Therefore, none 
of the records qualify for exemption 
under section 18(1)(c). 


The salary and employment benefits of 
the CEO and Senior VP are clearly infor- 
mation about these individuals, and fit 
within the definition of personal infor- 
mation under section 2(1) of the Act. 


Section 21(A4) isa clear indication by the 
legislature that the disclosure of the iden- 
tified types of information is in the public 
interest. The words “despite subsection 
(3)” do not limit the application of sec- 
tion 21(4) to those types of information 
identified in section 21(3), rather they 
identify types of information that the 
legislature clearly intended to fall within 
the exception contained in section 


21(1)(f). 


Monies paid by the Board to provide 
salary and benefits to its officers and 
employees are properly characterized as 


“public funds” and should be considered 
as such for the purposes of the Act. 


In defining what constitutes a benefit 
under section 21(4)(a), a distinction be- 
tween standard benefits and negotiated 
benefits is artificial. Particularly at a 
senior level, it is reasonable to expect that 
there will bea certain element of negotia- 
tion involved in establishing salary and 
benefit packages. Benefits are provided 
as a part of a remuneration package to 
employees, solely by virtue of the em- 
ployer-employee relationship, regardless 
of whether a particular benefit has been 
negotiated. 


The list of benefits enumerated in Order 
M-23 by Commissioner Wright was not 
intended to be exhaustive. The term 
“benefits” should be given an extensive 
definition in order to be consistent with 
the intent of both section 21 and the Act 
asa whole. The entitlements provided to 
the CEO and the Senior VP as part of 
their employment as officers and/or em- 
ployees of the Board are properly charac- 
terized as “benefits” for the purpose of 
section 21(4)(a). Therefore, release of 
the salary ranges and benefits would not 
constitute an unjustified invasion of their 


personal privacy. 


The ranges provided, although perhaps 
large in numerical terms, are reasonable 
in the circumstances, given the salary 
levels of the positions involved. The 
difference between the top and bottom 


_of the ranges established by the Board is 


approximately 26%, which is less than 
the spread in salary ranges for senior 
positions in the Ontario Civil Service.

The Ministry received a request for access 
to the prosecution case file and exhibits 
entered at a criminal trial involving the 
requester. The Ministry granted access 
to 31 pages of the record and denied 
access in whole or in part to the remain- 
ing 61 pages pursuant to sections 14, 15, 
19 and 21 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Ministry was upheld. 


During mediation, the appellant agreed 
not to pursue access to certain pages and 
the Ministry disclosed additional pages 
to the requester. A total of 25 pages 
remained at issue. In its representations, 
the Ministry indicated that its discretion 
to deny access to the remaining pages of 
the record was exercised under section 49 
of the Act. The Ministry made no repre- 
sentation with respect to the application 
of the discretionary exemptions under 
section 14.and 15 and those sections were 
not considered in the appeal. 


All of the record contains personal infor- 
mation. Certain pages contain personal 
information that relates solely to the 
appellant; other pages contain personal 
information that relate to both the appel- 
lant and other individuals. 


The discretionary exemption provided 
by section 49(a) is available to the 


Ministry with respect to these records 
because 16 pages qualify for exemption 


under section 19. 


Because the remaining pages contain 
personal information that was compiled 
and is identifiable as part of an investiga- 
tion into a possible violation of The 
Criminal Code of Canada by the appel- 
lant, the requirements for presumed 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
under section 21(3)(b) have been satis- 
fied. These pages do not contain infor- 
mation relevant to section 21(4) and 
none of the factors under section 21(2) 
which favour disclosure of the record are 
present in the circumstances of this ap- 
peal. Therefore, the presumption raised 
by section 21 (3)(b) has not been rebutted 
and disclosure of the severed portions of 
the record would constitute an unjusti- 
fied invasion of the personal privacy of 


other individuals.

personal information ¢ right of correction 


The Ministry received a request for access 
to, and correction of, a court transcript 
and any additional records about the 
requester in the possession of certain 
Ministry staff. The Ministry identified 
218 responsive records and released 217 
of them to the appellant. Part of the one 
remaining record was severed pursuant 
to sections 13(1) and 19 of the Act. The 
Ministry later withdrew its exemption 
claims and released the remaining record 


to the appellant, thereby resolving the 
access portion of the appeal. 


During mediation, the appellant indi- 
cated that she wanted to have the records 
destroyed instead of corrected. The Min- 
istry agreed to destroy all of the respon- 
sive records, with the exception of the 
court transcript, on the condition that 
the appellant sign an undertaking not to 
make any new requests for the destroyed 
records and not to communicate with 
anyone in the Ministry regarding the 
contents of the destroyed records. The 
appellant did not sign the undertaking 
and, as a result, the Ministry did not 
destroy the records. 


The appellant’s request is properly char- 
acterized as a request for correction of 
records containing her personal infor- 
mation, by way of destruction. It is not 
necessary to consider whether destruc- 
tion is the most appropriate remedy, 
because the appellant has failed to 
establish the requirements for a proper 
correction request. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision to deny the ap- 
pellant’s request for correction is upheld. 


The requirements necessary for granting 
a request for correction are: the informa- 
tion at issue must be personal and private 
information; and the information must 
be inexact, incomplete or ambiguous; 
and the correction can not be a substitu- 
tion of opinion. The appellant has not 
identified the specific information that 
she believes is incorrect, nor has she 
presented sufficient facts to substantiate 
her allegation that the records are false or 
inaccurate.

The Ministry received.a request for access 
to two files concerning the history and 
details of disposition of lot 4, concession 
3, Township of Hugel, Nippising Dis- 
trict. The Ministry granted access to the 
requested records. The requester exam-

Ministry’s decision, believing that other 
records exist. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s search was reasonable in

The appellant provided a list of the 
records which he believes are missing 
and submits that the records may be 
contained in a file pertaining to a 
different lot number. 


The Ministry does not dispute the fact 
that additional responsive records may 
have existed, however, based on its search, 
the Ministry’s position is that it has no 
such records in its custody or control. 
The Ministry provided two affidavits

and 1990. 


After notifying the company of the 
request, the Ministry granted partial 
access, denying access to the remainder 
of the records pursuant to section 17(1)(a) 
of the Act. During the processing of the 
appeal, the company agreed to the 
disclosure of additional records. These 
records were released to the appellant 


by the Ministry. 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 
records to the appellant. 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 17(1)(a), the Ministry and/or the 
company must satisfy all parts of a three 
part test. Sea 


The information contained in all of the 
records qualifies as commercial and/or 
financial information. Therefore part 
one of the test is met. 


The company has not established that 
the information in the remaining records 
was “supplied” to the Ministry “in confi- 
dence”. However, rather than make a 
conclusive finding on part two of the test, 
the decision was based on the application 


of the third part of the test. 


The company provides no additional 
facts or arguments other than repeating 
the assertion that disclosure of the infor- 
mation could reasonably be expected to 
result in significant harm to its interest. 
The company has failed to provide any 
objectively reliable evidence as to how its 
competitors could use the information in 
a way which could result in a significant

AND PRIVACY

prejudice to its competitive position 
(Section 17(1)(a)). The company has 
failed to establish the requirements of 
part three of the three part test. There- 
fore, none of the records at issue in this 
appeal is exempt under section 17(1)(a).

KEYWORDS 
compliance investigation * reasonable steps 
to locate record * record does not exist 


* transfer of request 


Between November 1991, and March 
1992, the Stadium Corporation of On- 
tario Limited (SkyDome) received 10 
requests from the same individual for 
information relating to the proposed sale 
of SkyDome. SkyDome issued several 
decision letters, each denying access on 
the basis that no records exist. The 
requester appealed all of the decisions. 
The Compliance Department of the IPC 
was asked to attend at SkyDome and 
make an independent determination as 
to whether SkyDome had made reason- 
able efforts to locate responsive records. 
Following the completion of the Com- 
pliance Department’s investigation, an 
official at SkyDome was asked to search 
the files of certain members of the Board 
of Directors and to determine the 


institutional status of the committee 
negotiating the sale of SkyDome. 
SkyDome did not respond to the 


re quest. 


ORDER 

SkyDome’s position that no responsive 
records exist in its custody or under its 
control is reasonable in the circumstances. 
SkyDome was ordered to transfer the 10 
requests to the Ministry of Treasury and 
Economics and to advise the appellant in 
writing of this transfer. 


When the Compliance Department staff 
attended at SkyDome to determine the 
adequacy of search for responsive records, 
they were advised that no searches had 
been conducted. Accordingly, the 
searches for responsive records were not 
reasonable. However, based on the inde- 
pendent investigation conducted by the 
Compliance Department, SkyDome’s 


‘position that no responsive records exist 


is a reasonable one, but only as it relates 
to records within the custody or under 


the control of SkyDome. 


In its representations, SkyDome con- 
firmed that the committee negotiating 
the sale of SkyDome is a provincial com- 
mittee, reporting directly to the Treas- 
urer of Ontario and not to SkyDome. 
An official at the Ministry of Treasury 
and Economics confirmed that the 
negotiating committee does not report 
to the Board of Directors of SkyDome. 
Therefore, any records relating to the 
activities of the negotiating committee, 
if they exist, would be in the custody or 
under the control of the Ministry of 


Treasury and Economics. 


SkyDome failed to comply with the re- 
quirements of section 25(1) of the Act 
which states that where an institution 
receives a request for access to a record 
that the institution does not have in its 
custody or under its control, the institu- 


tion shall make all necessary inquiries to 
determine whether another institution 
has custody or control and shall forward 
the request to the other institution within 
15 days. Under this section, the institu- 
tion must also advise the requester of the 
transfer. 


Ina postscript to the Order, the Assistant 
Commissioner commented that the ac- 
tions of SkyDome during the course of 
these appeals were clearly not in keeping 
with the spirit of the Act, and, not what 
would be expected from an institution 
which has had considerable experience 
in dealing with the request and appeal 


procedures contained in the Act.

The Ministry received a request for access 
to correspondence relating to certain 
activities of the requester. The Ministry 
denied access to the responsive records 
pursuant to sections 14(1)(a), (b), (d) 
and (f), 14(2)(c) and (d), 20 and 21(1) of 
the Act. During mediation the scope of 
the request was narrowed to include only 
the signatures of the authors of one letter. 
After being informed of the narrowed 
request the Ministry issued a revised de-

cision, denying access to the signatures 
pursuant to section 21(1) and 65(2)(a) 
of the Act. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision under section 21 


was upheld. 


In order for a record to fall within the 
scope of section 65(2)(a), it must be in 
respect of a psychiatric patient, and it 
must be a “clinical record” as defined by 
section 35(1) of the Mental Health Act. 
The signatures on the letter, in and of 
themselves, do not satisfy these require- 
ments and, therefore, section 65(2)(a) 
does not apply to the record at issue in 


this appeal. 


In order for section 21(1) to apply, the 
information at issue must be “personal 
information”, as defined in section 2(1) 
of the Act. Although a name alone does 
not qualify as an individual's “personal 
information”, where that name appears 


inthecontext ofa specific complaint filed 


by an individual, the name satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (h) of the 
definition in that disclosure of the name 
would reveal other personal information 


about the individual. 


The names of the authors of the record, 
in and of themselves, are not properly 
characterized as any of the types of infor- 
mation listed in section 21(3)(a), or any 
of the other types of information listed 
in other subsections of section 21(3). 
Therefore, there is no presumption of an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 


The appellant submits that he requires 
the record for two reasons: to proceed 
with the request to the Health Disci- 
plines Board to review a decision by the 
College of Nurses of Ontario regarding a 
complaint he lodged; and to assist the 
investigation of a complaint he has filed 


with the Office of the Ombudsman. He 


submits that disclosure of the record 
would submit the activities of the Minis- 
try to public scrutiny (section 21(2)(a)) 
and would be relevant to a fair determi- 
nation of his rights (section 21(2)(d)). 


Disclosure of the signatures of the 
authors of the record would not subject 
the activities of the Ministry to public 
scrutiny, therefore, section 21(2)(a) is 
not a relevant consideration. Although 
the appellant has a legal right to request a 
review of a decision of the College of 
Nurses by the Health Disciplines Board 
and to lodge a complaint with the Office 
of the Ombudsman, the appellant has 
failed to establish that the signatures may 
have some bearing on the determination 
of these rights, or that these signatures 
are required in order to prepare for the 
proceedings or to ensure an impartial 
hearing. Therefore, section 21(2)(d) is 
not a relevant consideration. 


Because none of the factors which weigh 
in favour of disclosure of the signature 
apply in the circumstances of this appeal, 
the mandatory exemption provided by 
section 21(1) applies to prohibit disclo- 
sure of the signatures.

The Ministry of Northern Development 
and Mines received a request for access to 
information relating to certain funding 
proposals submitted to the Ministry 
under the Mine Technology Research 
Sub-Program of the Northern Ontario 
Development Agreement (NODA), 
together with the Ministry’s evaluations 
of the proposals. 


Northern Ontario Development 
Agreement is a joint undertaking of 
the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Ontario whose purpose 
is to encourage economic development 
and diversification in Northern Ontario 
by the developmentand implementation 
of strategies for sustainable development 
in tourism, forestry and minerals. A 
joint federal provincial management 
committee administers the programs 
operated under NODA. The mining 
and minerals technology program 
technical sub-committee is responsible 
for administration of the funding 
program. 


The Ministry provided access to only one 
proposal which involved the requester, 
and denied access to all other responsive 
records pursuant to sections 15(a) and 
17(1) of the Act. Notice that an inquiry 
was being conducted to review the deci- 
sion of the ministry was sent to the 
appellant, the ministry and 14 com- 
panies or individuals who submitted 
proposals. Only one affected person 
objected to the release of the proposal 
and evaluation relating to his project. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to disclose 
the requested proposals and their 
evaluations. 


The Ministry’s representations, as well as 
the federal government's position, focus 
on the possibility that the release of the 
records would prejudice the relationship 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


between the mining industry and both 
levels of government, not the relation- 
ship between the federal and provincial 
governments, themselves. Accordingly, 
the Assistant Commissioner found that 
the Ministry had failed to establish an 
expectation of prejudice to the conduct 
of intergovernmental relations could 
reasonably be expected to result from the 
disclosure of the records and, therefore, 
the records do not qualify for exemption 
under section 15(a). 


In order fora record to qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 17(1)(a)(b) or (c), the 
Ministry and/or the affected person re- 
sisting disclosure must satisfy each part of 
a three part test. In the circumstances of 
this appeal the Assistant Commissioner 
found that the information at issue con- 
sist of scientific, technical and/or finan- 
cial information with the exception of 
some portions of the evaluations. The 
Assistant Commissioner also found the 
proposals and those parts of the evalua- 
tions which contain scientific, technical 
and/or financial information were “sup- 
plied” to the Ministry for the purposes of 
section 17(1). However, the Ministry 
and/or the affected person failed to 
establish that the record or parts of the 
record which were supplied to the Min- 
istry were supplied “in confidence”. 
Therefore, the second part of the test has 
not been established and the records do 
not qualify for exemption.

two psychiatric reports prepared at the 
Peterborough Civic Hospital concern- 
ing the requester’s client. The records at 
issue are photocopies of a letter from a 
psychiatrist at the hospital to another 
physician concerning the client and a 
two page psychiatricassessment prepared 
by a psychologist at the hospital also 
concerning the client. The Ministry of 
Health was added as an affected party to 
the appeal and provided with an oppor- 


tunity to submit representations. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to provide the 
appellant with a proper decision letter 
regarding access to the records within 20 
days. 


In order for a record to fall within the 
scope of section 65(2)(a), it must be in 
respect of a psychiatric patient, and it 
must be a “clinical record” as defined by 
section 35(1) of the Mental Health Act 
(the WHA). Because the records were 
compiled by doctors of the Department 
of Psychology at the Peterborough Civic 
Hospital which has been designated as a 
“psychiatric facility” and because the 
records were created after the appellant’s 
client was examined at the hospital as an 
out patient, the Assistant Commissioner 
was satisfied that the records are “in 
respect of psychiatric patient”. However, 
both the appellant and the Ministry of 
Health agreed that the records were not 
“clinical records”. Therefore, they fall 
outside the scope of section 65(2)(a) of 
the Act. 


In order fora clinical record to fall within 
the scope of section 65(2)(b) it must 
satisfy a three part test. It must: contain 


the types ofinformation listed in 65(2)(b) 
and be in respect of a psychiatric patient 
and have a clinical purpose, nature or 
value. By its nature, a copy of a clinical 
record would satisfy the first two require- 
ments, but the third requirement is not 
met as the record is maintained by the 
Ministry for a non clinical purpose. 
Therefore, the requirements of the third 
part of the test under section 65(2)(b) 
have not been established.

The Ministry of the Solicitor General 


received a request for access tO a record 


identified as the “level three inspection 
report 1992 -Belleville Police Force”. 
The Ministry granted access to 101 pages 
of the report in full and denied access to 
parts of the remaining 15 pages pursuant 
to sections 14(1)(b) and (e) and 21 of the 
Act. The requester appealed the Minis- 
try’s decision and raised the possible 
application of section 23 of the Act, the 
“public interest override”. Notice that 
inquiry was being conducted to review 
the Ministry’s decision was sent to three 
individuals, (the affected persons, one, 
two and three) and another party, (the 
affected party), whose interests might be 
affected by disclosure of the record. In its 
representations, theaffected party claimed 
that sections 21(1), 14(1)(a)(f), 14(2)(a) 
and 18(1)(f) of the Act apply to the 
record. The affected party also claimed 
that section 14(1)(b) applies to the entire 
record not justasmall portion, as claimed 


by the Ministry. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Ministry was par- 
tially upheld. 


Sections 14(1)(a) and (f), 14(2)(a) and 
18(1)(f) are discretionary exemptions 
which were not claimed by the Ministry. 
In the Commissioner's view, the appeal 
is not one of those “rare occasions” when 
an exemption, other than a mandatory 
exemption, not raised by the Ministry, 


should be considered. 


Part of the record contains the personal 
information of “affected person one” 
only; other pages contain the personal 
information of affected persons “one” 
and “two” and another page contains the 
personal information of affected person 
“three” only. One page contains case 
numbers which, if disclosed, could not 
identify a particular individual and, 
therefore do not satisfy the requirements 
of the definition of personal informa- 
tion. 


Both the Ministry and the affected party 
claim that section 21(3)(g) applies to the 
severances on certain pages. Although, it 
could be argued that some of the 
severances contain “evaluations” of the 
author of the report, because of the 
nature of the report, the severed infor- 
mation has no “personal” or “personnel” 
component as required by section 
21(3)(g). The information at issue can 
be considered to be highly sensitive and 
section 2 1(2)(f) applies to all the personal 
information which has been severed from 
the record. Since none of the factors 
listed in section 21(2) which favour dis- 
closure are present, the disclosure of the 
information severed from certain pages 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 


of the affected persons’ personal privacy. 


The Ministry has provided sufficient in- 
formation to satisfy the requirements for 
the application of section 14(1)(b) in that 
disclosure of the record could reasonably 
be expected to interfere with an investi- 
gation from which a law enforcement 
proceeding is likely to result. 


The information about the types of fire- 


arms and the training in their use pro- 
vided to members of the Belleville Police 
Force does not qualify for exemption 
under section 14(1)(e). Disclosure of 
this information would not reveal any 
information that has not already been 
discussed publicly in relation to police 
forces across the province. 


Section 23 does not apply to information 
which has been found to be exempt 
under section 14 of the Act, therefore the 
Commissioner's discussion of section 23 
is restricted to severances on one page 
only. The appellant submits that there is 
a compelling public interest in the disclo- 
sure of the entire record in order to 
restore public confidence in the Belleville 
Police Force. The Ministry has ordered 
an inquiry into the conduct of the 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Belleville Police Force and the Belleville 
Police Services Board. The appellant has 
received access to virtually the entire 
record. The record, including the small 
portion which has not been disclosed, 
will form part of the subject matter of 
the “inquiry” the Ministry has ordered. 
In the Commissioner’s view, the degree 
of disclosure which has taken place, 
together with the fact that a “inquiry” 
is presently underway, leads him to 
conclude that section 23 of the Act does 


not apply.

The Ministry of the Attorney General 
received a request for access to all records 
relating to a charge of sexual assault laid 
against the requester’s former husband. 
The requester indicated that she was 
requesting access to the information on 
behalf of herselfand her 11 year old child 


who was the victim of the alleged assault. 


The Ministry granted partial access to the 
record. It cited section 21 to deny access 
to a psychological assessment of the hus- 
band and parts of three pieces of corre- 
spondence where reference was made to 


10 


the psychological assessment; sections 19 
and 21 to deny access to a statement of 
certain individuals; and section 14(2)(a), 
19 and 21 to deny access to a record 
prepared by a police officer. During 
mediation, the Ministry provided partial 
access to the husband’s statement and 
the appellant indicated that she was not 
seeking access to the psychological 
assessment. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


Because the appellant has provided evi- 
dence of her lawful custody of the child, 
the Inquiry Officer was satisfied that it 
was appropriate to consider the request 
under section 66(c) which allows a per- 
son who has lawful custody of an indi- 
vidual who is less than 16 years of age to 
exercise any right or power conferred on 


the individual by the Act. 


The severed portion of the husband’s 
statement and the references to the psy- 
chological assessment consist of recorded 
information about the husband and this 
information qualifies as the personal 
information of the husband. These 
severances do not contain any personal 
information of the appellant or her child. 
The record prepared by the police officer 
contains recorded information about the 
appellant, her child and the husband and 
qualifies as personal information of all 
three parties. 


In order to properly exempt a record 
under section 14(2)(a), the Ministry must 
satisfy each part of a three part test. The 
record was prepared by an officer of the 
Ontario Provincial Police which is prop- 
erly considered to bean agency which has 
the function of enforcing and regulating 
compliance with the law. However, the 
record at issue was prepared in the course 
of a supervisor’s internal investigation 


into the conduct of an officer of the 
court, not an investigation which carried 
with it the possibility of a “law enforce- 
ment” proceeding. Therefore, section 


14(2)(a) is not applicable. 


The appellant submits that because a 
copy of the psychological assessment was 
disclosed to her by the husband’s lawyer, 
the husband has voluntarily waived his 
right to privacy in reference to the assess- 
mentand, therefore, to the passages which 
refer to it. In the Inquiry Officer’s view, 


the fact that the appellant is in possession. 


of the psychological assessment does not 
negate the application of section 21 (3). The 
references to the psychological assess- 
ment relate to a psychological evaluation 
of the husband and the presumption 
that disclosure would constitute an un- 
justified invasion of privacy found in 
section 21(3)(a) applies. Although cer- 
tain personal information will be dis- 
closed to the public during a public court 
proceeding, it does not necessarily follow 
that by becoming involved in such a 
proceeding an individual has waived his 
orher privacy rights and that the personal 
information should, therefore, be freely 
and routinely available to anyone who 
asks, particularly if the public court pro- 
ceeding has not commenced. The fact 
that the charge was withdrawn does not 
negate the application of section 2 1 (3)(b). 
Because the husband’s statement was 
compiled and is identifiable as part of an 
investigation into a possible violation of 
law, the presumption found in section 


21(3)(b) applies. 


Section 21(4) is not relevant in the cir- 
cumstances of this appeal. Section 
21(2)(d) is not a relevant consideration 
because the appellant has not established 
that the personal information which she 
is seeking has any bearing on or is signifi- 


cant to the determination of the right in © 


question or that the personal informa- 
tion is required to prepare for a proceed-

ing or to ensure an impartial hearing. 
The victim of the alleged offence, and/or 
the mother of the victim, does not have 
an absolute right under the Actto view 
all material relating to theallegation. The 
appellant and the child’s right of access 
must be balanced against the husband’s 
right to the protection of his privacy. 


None of the presumptions contained in 
section 21(3) apply to the record pre- 
pared by the police officer. None of the 
factors listed under section 21(2) which 
weigh in favour of not disclosing the 
information are relevant in the circum- 
stances of this appeal.- Therefore, the 
disclosure of the record prepared by the 
police officer would not bean unjustified 
invasion of the husband’s personal pri- 
vacy and section 49(b) does not apply.

payments under section 17(1)(a) of the 
Act. 

ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 


record. 


For a record to qualify for exemption 
under 17(1)(a), the Ministry and/or the 
company must satisfy the requirements 
of each part of a three part test. 


All of the information contained in the 
record qualifies as commercial and/or 
financial information. Therefore, the 
first part of the test is met. 


To meet the second part of the test the 
Ministry or the company must prove 
that the information was supplied in 
confidence either explicitly or implicitly. 
In order to satisfy the “supplied” part of 
the test, it is not necessary to show that 
the record itself was supplied to the Min- 
istry. [he requirements of the test will be 
satisfied if it can be demonstrated that 
information contained in the record was 
originally supplied to the Ministry. The 
format in which the information is pre- 
sented is not determinative of the issue of 
whether it was supplied. The informa- 
tion contained in the schedule of pay- 
ments was originally “supplied” to the 
Ministry through the invoices submitted 
to it by the company. The fact that the 
information was subsequently incorpo- 


rated into a record created by the Minis- — 


try does not alter the fact that it was 
originally supplied to the Ministry by the 
company. Similarly, information not 
contained in a record can be found to 
have been supplied if it is possible to 
ascertain, based on the contents of the 
record, the actual information supplied 
to the Ministry. The company has not 


explained how or in what way the infor- 
mation in the record could be used to 
determine workload volumeat individual 
specimen collection centres. Therefore, 
the parties resisting disclosure have failed 
to provide sufficient evidence to per- 
suade the Inquiry Officer that inaccurate 
inference about the company can be 
drawn from the information contained 
in the record. Neither the Ministry nor 
the company have addressed the element 
of confidentiality in their representa- 
tions. Therefore, the Inquiry Officer 
found that the second part of the test for 
exemption under section 17(1)(a) of the 
Act had not been established.

The Ontario Northland Transportation 
Commissioner (the ONTC) received two 
requests: for access to copies of 1) the 
contract between the ONTC and Bear- 
skin Airways (Bearskin) and the “deal” 
between the ONTC and Air Ontario, 
and 2) the ONTC study of DASH 8 


service into Kenora.

COMMISSIONER/

The ONTC denied access to records 
responsive to the first request pursuant to 
section 17 and 18 of the Act and to the 
records responsive to the second request 
pursuant to sections 13 and 18 of the Act. 
During mediation the agreement, with 
the exception of schedules E and F were 
disclosed to the appellant. Therefore, the 
records remaining at issue are schedules E 
and F of the agreement between ONT'C 
and Bearskin and four related change 
notices to the agreement (Record 1) and 
the market analysis data which consists of 
a financial analysis of costs, passenger 
load analysis and a financial comparison. 
(Record 2) 


Bearskin submitted that Record 1 must 
not be disclosed in keeping with the 
privacy protection purpose of the Act. 
The use of the term “individual” in the 
Act makes it clear that the protection 
provided with respect to the privacy of 
personal information relates only to 
natural persons. 


ORDER 
The ONTC decision was partially up- 
held. 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 18(1)(a), the ONTC must estab- 
lish that the information is a trade secret, 
or a financial, commercial, scientific or 
technical information; and belongs to 
the government of Ontario or an institu- 
tion; and has monetary value or potential 
monetary value. Although Records 1 
and 2 contain financial and commercial 
information, it is not clear to which party 
the information belongs or whether it 
belongs to both. In any event, the pur- 
pose of section 18(1)(a) is to permit the 
ONTC to refuse to disclose the record 
where circumstances are such that disclo- 
sure would deprive the ONTC of the 
monetary value of the information. In 
order to satisfy the third part of the test, 
the information itself must have an in- 


12 


trinsic monetary value. In the circum- 
stances of this appeal, the information 
itself does not appear to have monetary 
value or potential monetary value. 


To establish a valid exemption under 
section 18(1)(c), the ONTC must suc- 
cessfully demonstrate a reasonable ex- 
pectation of prejudice to the economic 
interest or competitive position of a gov- 
ernment institution rising from disclo- 
sure of the information. The ONTC has 
not provided any evidence in support of 
the application of section 18(1)(c) to 
Record 1. In the Inquiry Officer's view, 
only Record 2 contains information that 
disclosure of which could reasonably be 
expected to prejudice the economic in- 
terest or competitive position of the 


ONTC. 


The ONTC has not provided detailed 
and convincing evidence that disclosure 
of the information in Record 1 could 
reasonably be expected to injurious to the 
financial interest of the government of 
Ontario or the ability of government of 
Ontario to manage the economy of 
Ontario. 


In order to be exempt under section 
17(1)(a)(b) or (c), ONTC mustestablish 
all three parts of the three part test. Only 
some of the information contained in 
Record 1 qualifies as financial and/or 
commercial information (Part 1). Both 
Bearskin and ONTC have failed to es- 
tablish the information was supplied in 
confidence, the second part of the section 
17(1) test. 


Bearskin has not met the requirements 
of the third part of the test respecting 
section 17(1)(a) as it has not provided 
detailed and convincing evidence of how 
competitors could use information con- 
tained in Record | in a way which could 
take business away from Bearskin.

The Ministry of Correctional Services 
received a request for access to informa- 
tion related to the requester’s previous 
employment at the Grandview Training 
School for Girls (Grandview) during the 
summer of 1973, including his past em- 
ployment file; position description; map 
of Grandview premises; names of resi- 
dence and housing arrangements at 
Grandview during the period of his em- 
ployment; names of residents who had 
escaped during the period of his em- 
ployment; procedures at Grandview for 
dealing with escapes and information 
regarding the escape alarm system and 
key policy in place during the period of 
his employment. 


The Ministry determined that any records 
responsive to the parts of the requests 
dealing with the position, specifications, 
map, escape procedures, alarm system 
and key policy would be held by the 
Archives of Ontario (the Archives) and 
transferred these parts of the request to 
the Archives, pursuant to section 25 of 
the Act. The Archives indicated that no 
records containing the personal informa- 
tion of the requester were located. The 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Archives identified one directly respon- 


sive record, the sight plan for Grandview, 
and four other records which were not 
directly responsive but did deal with the 
subject matter of the request. The Ar- 
chives denied access to all five records in 
their entirety pursuant to sections 
14(1)(a)(b)(9(g)(i)G) and/or (k), 
14(2)(d), 21(1) and 21(2)(f) and (i) of 
the Act. The requester appealed the 


Archives’ decision. 


There are five records at issue: a memo- 
randum describing the number and type 
of summer jobs available at Grandview 
during 1973; a sightplan; a memoran- 
dum regarding the use of OPC forms to 
report training school runaways; por- 
tions of two routine inspection reports; 
and the transcript of minutes from a 
Grandview employee relations commit- 
tee meeting. 


The Archives requested that the Water- 
loo Regional Police and the Ministry of 
the Solicitor General be added as affected 
parties to the appeal. The Assistant 
Commissioner denied the request be- 
cause sections 25-27 of the Act provide a 
scheme to address the situation where 
more than one institution has an interest 
in certain requested records. These sec- 
tions permit inter-institutional consulta- 
tions and the transfer of a request from 
one institution to another. There is no 
statutory right for an institution other 
than the one which has responded to an 
access request to be a party to an appeal. 
It is the responsibility of the Commis- 
sioner or his delegate to consider the 
circumstances of a particular appeal and 
determine if any other person should be 
given the status of an affected party based 
on the necessity or desirability of having 
those persons participate. 


ORDER 


The Archives decision was partially up- 
held. 


Evidence provided by the Archives is 
sufficient to establish the requirements of 
section 14(1)(b) with respect to records 
four and five. These records deal with 
various aspects of the operation of 
Grandview and outline certain proce- 
dures in place during the mid - 1970's 
and identify the activities of certain named 
individuals. Release of these two records 
could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with the current police investigation 
which has been undertaken with a view 
toa law enforcement proceeding or from 
which a law enforcement proceeding is 


likely to result (section 14(1)(b)). 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
Records 1, 2 and 3 do not qualify for 
exemption under any of sections 
14(1)(a)(b)(f) or (1). Record 1 isa memo 
which describes a number and type of 
summer job positions available at 
Grandview in 1973 and the qualifica- 
tions and pay assigned to these positions. 
The memois purely factual in nature and 
includes no information specific to any 
identifiable individual. Similarly, Record 
3 isa memo which provides the author’s 
views as the use of a form to report 
runaways from training schools. Record 
2, the sightplan, contains the topograph- 
ical representation of the grounds of 
Grandview. In the Assistant Commis- 
sioners view, disclosure of Records 1, 2 
and 3 could not reasonably be expected 
to result in any of the enumerated harms 


identified in sections 14(1)(a)(b)(f) or (1). 


The Archives claim section 14(1)(i)(j) 
and (k) of the Actas additional grounds 
for refusing to disclose Record 2. The 
Archives submits that the disclosure of 
information “about the grounds and 
buildings of the Waterloo Detention 
Centre would both endanger and possi- 
bly seriously compromise the security of 
that facility...and could be well used to 
facilitate the escape of persons who are 
under lawful detention in that correc- 


tional facility”. The Assistant Commis- 
sioner found that the parts of Record 2 
which would identify the former 
“Churchill House” and the 4-5 acres of 
surrounding land which serve as the 
Waterloo Detention Centre should be 
severed from the record and the rest of 
the record should be released to the 
appellant.

KEYWORDS

The Rent Review Hearings Board (the 
Board), an agency of the Ministry of 
Housing (the Ministry), received a re- 
quest for a copy of notes made at a pre- 
hearing conference by the Board mem- 
ber who presided at the conference. The 
Ministry denied access claiming that any 
notes that may have been taken were not 
in the custody or under the control of the 
Board. During the course of processing 
the appeal, the Ministry acknowledged 
that the notes did exist but refused to 
provide a copy of them to the Commis- 
sioner’s Office, again claiming that they 
were not in the custody or under the 
control of the Board. Because the issue of 
custody and control ofa Board member's 
notes has implications beyond the scope 
of this particular appeal, a group repre- 
senting the chairs of certain provincial 
agencies, boards and commissions was 


13 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


added as an affected party and provided 
with an opportunity to submit represen- 
tations. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


The application of freedom of informa- 
tion legislation to the notes of members 
of administrative tribunals has been con- 
sidered a number of times throughout 
the history of the development of the Act. 


In 1990, the government proposed an 
amendment to section 65 which would 
have excluded notes prepared by or fora 
member of a tribunal from the scope of 
the Act. Although this amendment was 
never passed into law, by introducing the 
amendment, the government implicitly 
acknowledged that tribunal members 
notes were currently covered by the Act, 
provided they were found to be in the 
custody or under the control of the 
tribunal. 


In the Assistant Commissioner's view, it 
was not necessary to address the issue of 
an adjudicative independence in order 
to dispose of the appeal. The sole issue is 
whether the Board members’ notes are in 
the custody or under the control of the 
Board, not whether the Board is able to 
demand production of the notes from its 
members. The fact that the members of 
the Board are independent decision- 
makers and not subject to the control or 
influence of the Board in the way in 
which they reach their decisions is not 
determinative of whether the notes are in 
the Board’s custody or under its control. 


Former Commissioner Sidney B. Linden 
outlined what he felt was the proper 
approach to determining whether spe- 
cific records fell within the custody or 
control of an institution in Order 120. A 
number of other orders have dealt with 
issue of custody and control; all turn on 


14 


the particular circumstances of the ap- 
peal in relation to the types of factors 
listed by former Commissioner Linden 
in Order 120. 


It is clear from the Board’s representa- 
tions that the notes are not currently in 
the custody of the Board. The issue of 
whether the notes are under the control 
of the Board is more complex. The notes 
which are the subject matter of the appeal 
are currently located outside the Board 
premises and are in the Board member's 
personal possession. The Board does not 
regulate the use of the notes and has taken 
no steps to exert control over them. They 
were created by the Board member for 
her own personal use and she never al- 
lowed any other person to see, read or use 
the notes for any purpose. Having re- 
viewed ‘the representations of all the 
parties and bearing in mind the indicia of 
control identified by former Commis- 
sioner Linden in Order 120, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner found that the notes 
created by the Board member are not in 
the control of the Board and therefore 
not accessible under the Act.

The Ontario Human Right Commis-

copies of correspondence between the 


requester’s member of provincial parlia- 
ment (MPP) and hisstaffand the OHRC 
regarding a complaint initiated by the 
requester against Laurentian University. 
The OHRC conducted a search of its 
records and located a letter from the 
MPP addressed to “to whom it may 
concern”. A copy of that record was 
provided to the requester. The OHRC 
advised the requester that no further 
records exist which are responsive to the 
request. The requester appealed the de- 
cision and maintained that additional 
records exist. 


ORDER 

The OHRC’s seatch for responsive 
records was reasonable in the circum-

The affidavit submitted by the Commis-

to locate records which would be respon-

searches were undertaken by OHRC 
staff in its Sudbury office, where the 
original complaint had been filed and 
processed. In addition, the Freedom of

The Ministry of Health received a re- 
quest for access to 11 specific records. 
The Ministry released some records and 
denied access to the rest, either in whole 
or in part, claiming sections 13(1), 


18(1)(c) and (e), 19 and 21(1) of the Act. 


The requester appealed the Ministry’s 
decision. During mediation, the appel- 
lant narrowed the scope of his request to 
five records. The records which remained 
at issue relate to a 1989 labour dispute 
between the Ontario Public Service 
Employees Union (the Union) and vari- 
ous ministries of the Ontario Govern- 
ment. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 
records to the appellant, subject to the 
severance of personal information of 
individuals other than the appellant. 


Record B is a two-page draft affidavit 
prepared by the Assistant Director of the 
Ministry’s Psychiatric Hospital Branch 
for the Administrator of the Pene- 
tanguishene Mental Health Centre. The 
affidavit was intended to be filed in sup- 
port of court proceeding regarding a job 
action underway at the Centre during 
1989. In the Assistant Commissioner’s 
view, Record B was not prepared for the 
purpose of giving advice or suggesting a 
course of action which would be ex- 
cepted or rejected in the deliberative 
process. It can be more accurately de- 
scribed as an outline of certain facts that 
the person who drafted the affidavit felt 
the signatory should include in the 
affidavit. Record J is a single sentence 
severed from a memorandum from the 
Assistant Director to the Assistant Deputy 
Minister of the Ministry’s Institutional 
Division. It describes the letter of agree- 
ment which resolve the labour relations 


dispute. In the Assistant Commis- 
sioner’s view, the sentence identifies an 
option available to the Ministry in imple- 
menting the agreement but does not 
contain any wording which would indi- 
cate whether this option is recommended 
ornot. Therefore, section 13(1) does not 


apply to Records B and J. 


Record C is a letter dated October 25, 
1989 from the Deputy Minister of Cor- 
rectional Services to the President of the 
Union. Because the letter was sent to the 
President of the Union, the Assistant 
Commissioner did not see how its release 
could prejudice the economic interest of 
the Ministry in future collective bargain- 
ing with its employees. The Ministry 
failed to provide the detailed and con- 
vincing evidence required to establish the 
requirements for the exemption under 
section 18(1)(c) of the Act. Record K is 
a memorandum from the Assistant 
Deputy Minister of the Operations Divi- 
sion of the Ministry of Correctional Serv- 
ices to other management personnel 
within that Ministry. The Ministry’s 
representations regarding Record K are, 
at best, generalized references to possible 
harm and, in the Assistant Commission- 
er’s view, the Ministry failed to provide 
the detailed and convincing evidence 
necessary to establish the requirements 
for exemption under section 18(1)(c). 


In regard to the application of section 
18(1)(e) to Record C, the only represen- 
tation made by the Ministry was “it is 
submitted that negotiations with respect 
to the issues in the documents continue 
at this time”. In the Assistant Commis- 
sioner’s view, this statement alone is not 
sufficient to establish the requirements of 
the section 18(1)(e) test. 


Record A isa letter from a legal counsel at 
the Ministry of the Attorney General to 
the Director of Legal Services at the 
Ministry of Correctional Services. There 


is nothing in the letter which can accu- 
rately be described as directly relating to 
seeking, formulating or giving legal 
advice. Therefore, in the Assistant 
Commissioner's view, the letter simply 
outlines administrative arrangements 
put in place by the legal counsel to deal 
with the transfer or responsibility for a 
particular file to a different lawyer and 
therefore the record does not qualify 
for exemption under section 19.

The Ministry of Correctional Services 
received a request for access to records 
relating to the requester. The Ministry 
released certain responsive records and 
denied access to the rest* pursuant to 
sections 49(b), 49(e) and 13(1) of the 
Act. The requester appealed the Minis- 
trys decision. During mediation ad- 
ditional records were released to the 
appellant. The Ministry also withdrew its 
exemptions claimed under sections 49(e) 
and 13(1) and raised sections 14(2)(a), 
14(2)(d), 19, 49(b), 49(d) and 65(2)(a) 
as a new exemption with respect to cer- 
tain records. Subsequently, the Ministry 


15 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


also raised the application of section 
65(2)(b) to some of the records. The 
appellant agreed not to pursue access to 
the records for which section 65(2)(a) 
and/or (b) had been claimed. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. : 


The Ministry claimed section 14(2)(a) as 
the basis for exempting an occurrence 
report and an investigation report both 
of which concern investigations ofallega- 
tions of improper conduct made by the 
appellant against Ministry staff while the 
appellant was an inmate at a correctional 
facility. In order fora record to qualify for 
exemption undersection 14(2)(a), itmust 
satisfy all parts of a three part test. Both 
the occurrence report and the investiga- 
tion report are properly characterized as 
reports and were prepared in the course 
of investigations, thereby satisfying the 
first two parts of the section 14(2)(a) 
exemption test. 


With regard to the third part of the test, 
the Ministry submits that it is an institu- 
tion which has the function of enforcing 
and regulating compliance with a law, 
namely the Ministry of Correctional Serv- 
ices Act. A number of previous orders 
have dealt with the status of internal 
investigations conducted by the Minis- 
try of Correctional Services and other 
institutions in the context of the defini- 
tion of law enforcement. In the Assistant 
Commissioner’s view, these records are 
properly characterized as internal in- 
vestigations into complaints about the 
conduct of Ministry staff and do not relate 
to the Ministry’s law enforcement 
responsibilities under the Ministry of Cor- 
rectional Services Act. This finding is sub- 
stantiated by the fact that the Ministry 
itselfacknowledges in its representations 
that if allegations of misconduct had 
been substantiated, the police would 


16 


have been involved prior to the laying of 
criminal charges. Therefore, the third 
part of the test for exemption under 
section 14(2)(a) has not been established 
by the Ministry. 


The Ministry claimed section 14(2)(d) 
of the Actfor three memoranda from the 
Acting Superintendent of Millbrook 
Correction Centre to other individuals 
in the Ministry. These memoranda de- 
scribe events associated with the appel- 
lant’s allegations of misconduct. The 
purpose of section 14(2)(d) is to allow an 
appropriate level of security with the 
respect to the records of individuals in 
custody. The application of this provi- 
sion should not be extended so far as to 
allow it to be used to deny access to 
information simply on the basis that the 
requester, who is no longer in custody, 1s 
seeking information about himself. The 
records which have been exempted by 
the Ministry under this section were 
created almost 10 years ago and relate to 
investigations which havelong since been 
completed. Regardless of whether or not 
the centre is a correctional authority for 
the purposes of section 14(2)(d), release 
of these records at this time to an indi- 
vidual who is no longer under the super- 
vision and control of the Ministry would 
not interfere with the Ministry’s ability 
to carry out its mandate. 


The Ministry claims that one page of the 


record qualifies for exemption because it 


was prepared by or for Crown Counsel ° 


for use in giving legal advice or in con- 
templation of or for use in litigation. The 
Assistant Commissioner found that the 
page was prepared for Crown Counsel 
and in contemplation of litigation and, 
therefore, qualified under the second 


branch of the section 19 exemption. 


Parts of the record fall under the defini- 
tion of personal information contained 
in the Actand relate to both the appellant 


and other individuals. The Ministry 
must look at the information and weigh 
the appellant’s right of access to his own 
personal information against other indi- 
vidual's right to the protection of their 
personal privacy. The Ministry claims 
that section 21(3)(d) isa relevant consid- 
eration. These records simply identify 
the individuals as being employees of the 
Ministry which, is not sufficient to satisfy 
the requirements of a presumed unjusti- 
fied invasion under section 21(3)(d). 
Sections 21(2)(e) and (i) are relevant 
considerations with respect to the per- 
sonal information ofa named individual. 
In the Assistant Commissioner's view, 
the release of a letter written by a certain 
individual could reasonably be expected 
to cause the person excessive personal 
distress and, therefore, section 21(2)(f) is 
a relevant consideration. 


The records for which the Ministry has 
claimed section 49(d) all contain the 
personal information of the appellant. 
The records consist of the occurrence 
reports, memoranda, comments concern- 
ing clinical diagnosis and assessment and 
treatment in case management notes. 


The Ministry’s representation on the 
application of section 49(d) are based 
upon assessments by an individual who 
has not met or interviewed the appellant 
since 1984. In the Assistant Commis- 
sioner’s view, thisassessment is not 
sufficiently current to provide adequate

The Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
received a request for access to the min- 
utes of the monthly board meetings of 
the Ontario Pork Producers Marketing 
Board for the period April 1990 to “the 
present time”. In June 1991, the same 
requester made a request for continuing 
access to the minutes for the next two 
years. The Ministry responded to the 
request for continuing access on four 
separate occasions. Each time, the Min- 
istry notified the marketing board and 
the board objected to the release of the 
minutes. Despite the objections, the 
Ministry decided to release the minutes 
to the requester, subject to certain 
The board appealed the 
Ministry’s four decisions, claiming that 
section 17(1)(a)(b) and (c) of the Act 
applied to the minutes. Subsequently, 
the Ministry indicated that although it 
had initially been prepared to release 
certain parts of the minutes to the appel- 
lant, it now wished to deny access to the 
minutes in their entirety pursuant to 


_section 17(1)(b). - 


Severances. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to release the 
minutes to the appellant subject to 
severances made by the Ministry in re- 
sponse to the original request. 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 17(1)(b) each part of a three part 
test must be satisfied. 


The minutes in their entirety do not 
automatically qualify as commercial in- 
formation solely because the board is 
engaged in commercial activities. In the 
Assistant Commissioner's view, only a 
small portion of the minutes contain 
information which satisfies the first part 
of the section 17 test. Much of the 
information contains administrative 
details such as attendance lists and ap- 
provals of agendas and minutes. Other 
information consists of accounts of 
discussions of such topics as preparation 
for attending a baseball game, the 
possible creation of a slogan for an- 
niversary celebrations and dress code for 
attendance at industry functions. The 
only information which meets the defi- 
nition of third party information under 
section 17 is information that relates 
directly to the actual marketing of pork 
or pork products or to the discussion of 
financial matters by the board. 


In order to satisfy the requirements of 
part two of the section 17 test, the infor- 
mation must have been supplied to the 
Ministry in confidence, either implicitly 
or explicitly. Because the board is re- 
quired to file copies of minutes with the 
Commission, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner was satisfied that the minutes were 
supplied to the Ministry. Both the 
Ministry and the board submit that the 
information was supplied in confidence 
implicitly and explicitly. The board ac- 
knowledges that there is no written policy 
on keeping the minutes confidential but 
states that it is their long standing 
corporate practice to treat the minutes 
confidentially. After reviewing the repre- 
sentations, the Assistant Commissioner 
was satisfied that the minutes were 
supplied in confidence and the second 
part of the test was satisfied. 


Part three of the section 17 test requires 
that the parties resisting disclosure present 
evidence that is detailed and convincing 
and describe a set of facts and circum- 
stances that could lead to a reasonable 
expectation that one or more of the 
harms described in section 17(1) would 
occur if the minutes were released. 


Both the Ministry and the board have 
failed to establish their claims that disclo- 
sure of the minutes would result in simi- 
lar information no longer being supplied 
to the Commission. 


After carefully reviewing the minutes 
and the representations of all parties, the 
Assistant Commissioner is of the view 
that the parties resisting disclosure have 
failed to establish that release of the minute 
items which have been found to contain 
commercial or financial informationand 
to have been supplied in confidence could 
reasonably be expected to result in any of 
the types of harms enumerated in section 


17(1)(a)(b) and/or (c) of the Acz.

INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The Ministry of Government Services 
received a request for access to “any and 
all allegations or representations made by 
a person, persons or group, opposing the 
leasing of a lot in the City of Gloucester, 
Regional Municipality of Ottawa- 
Carleton by the requester with the On- 
tario Property Administration Section.” 
The record which the Ministry identified 
as being responsive to the request consists 
of eight pages. The Ministry gave the 
requester total access to three pages and 
denied access to the remaining pages in 
their entirety pursuant to section 21 of 
the Act. Parts of the record at issue consist 
of a one page letter to the Ministry and 
four pages of a Ministry official’s notes of 
his telephone conversations with the 
author of the letter. The Ministry identi- 
fied these pages as containing the per- 
sonal information of the author of the 
letterand sought his/her consent for their 
release; however, the author withheld 
consent. In its representations, the Min- 
istry indicated that its discretion to deny 
access was exercised under section 49(b). 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


The appellant has stated that he is not 
asking for the names of the person, 
persons or groups but simply the repre- 
sentations and allegations. The Inquiry 
Officer was of the view that there would 
be a reasonable expectation that the 
individuals could be identified from the 
information remaining after the name, 
address and telephone number of the 
author has been severed from the record 
and, therefore, the record falls within the 
definition of personal information under 
subsection 2(1). 


A head may refuse to disclose to the 
individual to whom the information re- 
_ lates personal information where disclo- 
sure would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of another individual’s privacy 


18 


(section 49(b)). Sections 21 (2) and (3) of 
the Actprovide guidance in determining 
whether disclosure of the personal in- 
formation would result in unjustified 
invasion of the personal privacy of the 
individual to whom the information 
relates. Based on the contents of the 
records, it appears that the Ministry was 
engaged in an investigation of an alleged 
trespass in its capacity as owner of the 
property and not pursuant to any mandate 
to enforce the law. Therefore, the provi- 
sions of Section 21(3)(b) would not 


apply. 


Both the Ministry and the author submit 
that Section 21(2)(a) is a relevant con- 
sideration. In his representations, the 
appellant refers to the substance of section 
21(2)(d). After reviewing the representa- 
tions, the Inquiry Officer was satisfied 
that in the circumstances of this appeal, 
personal information contained in the 
record was supplied by the author in 
confidence and therefore, section 
21(2)(h), a factor that weighs in favour of 
non-disclosure, is a relevant considera- 
tion. With regard to section 21(2)(d), 
the appellant has not identified any legal 
right nor has he provided any evidence 
which would indicate that such a right is 
related to an existing or contemplated 
proceeding. Therefore, 21(2)(d), fair 
determination of rights, is not a relevant 
consideration. None of the other factors 
under section 21 (2) which favour disclo- 
sure are present. Therefore, the disclo- 
sure of the record to the appellant would 
constitute an unjustified invasion of the 
personal privacy of the author of the 
letter.

The Ministry of Health received a re- 
quest for access to all correspondence, 
letters, memos, documents, notices, etc. 
about or mentioning the Church of 
Scientology. The Ministry identified 
42 responsive records. The Ministry 
provided access to 33 records in their 
entirety, denying access to the remaining 
9 records, in whole or in part, pursuant 
to sections 13(1), 19, 21(1), 65(2)(a) 
and/or 65(2)(b) of the Acz. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


The Ministry claims that the severed 
portions of Records 1, 4 and 35 fall 
within the scope of section 65(2)(a) of 
the Act. In order fora record to fall within 
the scope of section 65(2)(a), it must be 
in respect of a psychiatric patient and it 
must be a “clinical record” as defined by 


section 35(1) of the Mental Health Act — 


(MHA). 


Section 35(1) of the HA defines clini- 
cal record as the “clinical record com- 
piled in a psychiatric facility in respect of 
a patient and includes part of a clinical 
record.” The Ministry severed the names 
of certain individuals contained in 
Records 1, 4 and 35. The Ministry feels 
that because the name of a patient is part 
of a clinical record, merely confirming — 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


that a person isa patient would violate the 
MHA. The Assistant Commissioner did 
not accept the Ministry’s position re- 
garding theapplication of section 65(2)(a) 
to the severed parts of Records 1, 4 and 
35. He found that these records were not 
“compiled in a psychiatric facility” and 
cannot, therefore, be classified “clinical 
records”. A name alone is not sufficient 
to bring a record which would otherwise 
not qualify as a “clinical record” within 
the scope of the definition. Therefore, 
the severed portions of Records 1, 4 and 
35 (the names) do not fall within the 
scope of section 65(2)(a). Because the 
severed portions of Records 1, 4 and 35 
appear to contain personal information 
of individuals other than the appellant, 
the Assistant Commissioner considered 
these records under section 21. 


The Ministry claims that Record 36 falls 
within the scope of section 65(2)(b) of 
the Act. In order fora record to fall within 
the scope of section 65(2)(b), it must 
satisfy all three parts of a three part test 
established in Order P-374. ‘The severed 
portions of Record 36 satisfy the require- 
ments of the first parts of the test: they 
contain some of the types of information 
listed in section 65(2)(b) and are in re- 
spect of psychiatric patients. However, 
these portions of the record do not satisfy 
the third part of the test. Record 36 was 
created by a policy program analyst at the 
Mental Health Facilities Branch to in- 
form the Legal Services Branch of certain 
complaints concerning individual psy- 
chiatric patients. The reason for having 
Record 36 in the custody and control of 
the Ministry’s Legal Services Branch or 
Mental Health Facilities Branch has 
no “clinical purpose nature or value”. 
Accordingly, the third requirement of 
the test has not been established and the 
severed portion of Record 36 does not 
fall within the scope of section 65(2)(b) 
of the Act. Because the severed portion of 
Record 36 appeared to contain personal 


information of individuals other than 
the appellant, the Assistant Commissioner 
also included it under his discussion of 
section 21. 


The Ministry has claimed section 13(1) 
of the Actapplied to the severed portions 
of Record 5. Generally speaking, advice 
“pertains to the submission of a sug- 
gested course of action which will ulti- 
mately be accepted or rejected by its 
recipient in the deliberative process. 
Recommendations should be viewed in 
the same vein. Severed portions on page 
1 of Record 5 describe the course of 
action identified by a consultant in the 
Ministry’s Policy Development Branch 
and recommend its adoption by the 
Minister. Therefore, these portions of 
Record 5 qualify for exemption under 
section 13(1). The Assistant Commis- 
sioner reviewed sections 13(2)(a) through 
(I) and found that none of the exceptions 
apply in the circumstances of this appeal. 


The Ministry claims that section 19 
applies to Records 1, 3, 34 and/or the 
severed portions of Records 1 and/or 4. 
The institution claims the first part of the 
common-law solicitor/client privilege is 
the basis for exempting these records. In 
order fora record to be subject to the first 
part of the common-law solicitor/client 
privilege, the institution must provide 
evidence that a record satisfies a 4-part 
test. Records 1, 2, 3,4 and 34 are written 
communications between legal advisors 
and Ministry personnel or their agents, 
and therefore, satisfy parts 1 and 3 of the 
test. Having reviewed the records, the 
Assistant Commissioner found that they 
are all of a confidential nature and all 
relate to the seeking formulating or 
giving of legal advice. Therefore, parts 
2 and 4 of the test are also satisfied and 
the records qualify for exemption under 
section 19. 


The Ministry claimed section 21(1) of 
the Act as the basis for exempting the 
name of an individual in Record 29. In 
addition, the Assistant Commissioner 
determined that information severed 
from Records 1, 4, 35 and 36 should 
also be considered under this mandatory 
exemption. 


The namesevered from Record 29 in and 
of itself cannot properly be characterized 
as any of the types of information listed in 
section 21(3)(g). The same reasoning ap- 
plies to the names and other information 
severed from Records 1, 4, 35 and 36. 
Therefore, no presumption of an unjus- 
tified invasion of personal privacy exist 
with respect to any of the information 
contained in these records. 


Because none of the factors which weigh 
in favour of disclosure of the names and 
other severed portions of the records are 
present in the circumstances of this ap- 
peal, it is not necessary for the Assistant 
Commissioner to determine whether or 
not the considerations outlined in sec- 
tions 21(2)(f) and/or (h), which were 
raised by the institution, apply to the 
information severed from the records. 
Therefore, the mandatory exemption 
provided by section 21(1) of the Act 
applies to prohibit disclosure of the per- 
sonal information of individuals other 
than the appellant which has been sev- 
ered from Records 1, 4, 29, 35 and 36.

The Ontario Human Rights Commis- 7 


sion (the OHRC) received a request for 
access to all records related toa complaint 
against the requester, including the writ- 
ten complaint, the investigator's notes, 
the OHRC’s counsel’s notes and the 
transcript of the hearing relevant to the 
complaint. The OHRC granted access 
to a typewritten version of the complaint 
and denied access to the remaining records 
pursuant to sections 14(1)(a) and (b), 
14(2)(a) and 19 of the Act. Notice thatan 
inquiry was being conducted to review 
the decision was sent to the OHRC, the 
appellant, the person who made the com- 
plaint and a representative of other indi- 
viduals named in the records. In its 
representations, the OHRC also cited 
exemptions under sections 49(a) and (b) 
of the Act. The representative provided 
written consent from 6 individuals to 
disclose any information pertaining to 
them in the records to the appellant. In 
addition, the representative consented to 
disclosure of any information relating to 
a named police service to the appellant. 
The appellant narrowed the scope of his 
request to include only the written 
complaint; the investigator’s notes, 
including notes taken at a hearing; and 
the solicitor’s notes taken at a hearing. 


20 


ORDER 
The OHRC was ordered to reconsider 
the exercise of discretion with respect to 


one record. The OHRC’s decision with 
regard to access was partially upheld. 


The majority of the pages of the record at 
issue qualify as personal information of 
theappellantand other individuals. Some 
of the pages do not contain personal 
information ofany identifiable individual. 


The OHRC submits that sections 
14(1)(a) and (b) apply to all of the records 
at issue. These sections state that a head 
may refuse to disclose a record where the 


disclosure could reasonably be expected 


to interfere with the law enforcement 
matter (14(1)(a)) or interfere with an 
investigation undertaken with a view toa 
law enforcement proceeding or from 
which a law enforcement proceeding is 


likely to result (14(a)(b)). 


It is clear that the records were generated 
in a course of the OHRC’s investigation 
of a complaint under the Ontario Human 
Rights Code which may lead to proceed- 
ings before a Board of Inquiry. Be- 
cause these investigations may lead to 
proceedings before a Board of Inquiry, 
they are properly characterized as law 
enforcement proceedings. The purpose 
of sections 14(1)(a) and (b) is to provide 
the OHRC with the discretion to pre- 
clude access to records in circumstances 
where disclosure would interfere with an 
ongoing law enforcement matter or in- 
vestigation. Because of the length of time 
this investigation has been inactive and 
the nature of the information contained 
in the records, the Inquiry Officer was 
not satisfied that disclosure of the records 
could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with the law enforcement matter or 
investigation. 


The OHRC submits that the hand- 


written complaint and the investigator s 


notes qualify for exemption under section 
14(2)(a). Section 14(2)(a) states that a 
head may refuse to dispose a record that 
is a report prepared in the course of law 
enforcement inspections or investigations 
by an agency which has the function of 
enforcing and regulating compliance 
with a law. 


In order to properly exempt a record 
under section 14(2)(a), the OHRC must 
satisfy each part of a 3-part test. Having 
reviewed the information contained in 
these records, the Inquiry Officer was of 
the opinion that none fall within the 
definition of report. They do notcontain 
“a formal statement or account of the 
results of collation and consideration of 
information”. Because the records do 
not qualify as reports, the discretionary 
exemption provided by section 14(2)(a) 
does not apply to these records. 


The OHRC submits that section 19 
applies to all of the records at issue. 
Section 19 states that a head may refuse 
to dispose a record that is subject to 
solicitor-client privilege or that was pre- 
pared by or for Crown counsel for use in 


giving legal advice or in contemplation of 


or for use in litigation. 


One page of the Human Rights Officer’s 
handwritten notes relate to a conversa- 
tion with counsel for the OHRC in 
which legal advice was sought. Because 
there has been no waiver of confidential- 
ity, the Inquiry Officer found that the 
requirements of the first part of the first 
branch of the section 19 exemption have 


been satisfied with respect to this page. 


The handwritten complaint and the 
remaining handwritten notes of the 
investigator do not qualify for exemp- 
tion under either part of the section 19 
exemption. These records are not, nor 
do they make reference to, communica- 
tions with a legal advisor. In addition, 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


these records do not relate to the seeking, 
formulating or giving of legal advice. 


The notes taken by the investigator dur- 
ing the hearing are not and do not make 
reference to confidential communica- 
tions between aclient and a legal advisor. 
The Inquiry Officer did not accept that 
this record was created or obtained espe- 
cially for the lawyer’s brief for existing or 
contemplated litigation. 


The notes taken by counsel for the 
OHRC during the hearing were taken to 
obtain the evidence of the complainant 
in the event that the complainant was 
unable to attend a board of inquiry, 
should one be deemed necessary, due to 
his deteriorating medical condition. 


In the Inquiry Officer’s view, the notes 
taken by counsel for the OHRC repre- 
sent a record which was prepared by 
Crown counsel for the purpose of 
“giving legal advice or in contemplation 
of litigation or for use in litigation” 
and therefore, satisfy the second 
branch of the section 19 exemption. 


The OHRC submits that disclosure of 
the remaining records to the appellant 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of the privacy of another individual. 
Because all of the records at issue contain 
the personal information of the appellant 
as well as other individuals, they will be 


considered in the context of section 49(b). 


Six of the individuals whose personal 
information appears in the records have 
consented to the disclosure of their 
personal information to the appellant. 
Accordingly, the disclosure of that 
information to the appellant would 
not constitute an unjustified invasion 
of the personal privacy of these six 
individuals and section 49(b) does not 
apply. Because the remaining pages of 
- the records were compiled as part of an 


investigation into a possible violation of 
law, namely the Ontario Human Rights 
Code, the Inquiry Officer found that 
disclosure of personal information of 
other individuals appearing in the 
records would constitute a presumed 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
under section 21(3)(b). 


Once it has been determined that the 
requirements for a presumed unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy have been 
met, the Inquiry Officer must consider 
whether any other provisions of the Act 
come into play to rebut this presump- 
tion. Section 21(4) outlines a number of 
circumstances which, if they exist, could 
operate to rebut a presumption under 
section 21(3). None of the circum- 
stances listed in section 21 (4) are present. 


In his representations, the appellant has 
not made reference to any of the factors 
listed in section 21(2) which weigh in 
favour of disclosure and the Inquiry Of- 
ficer found that none of these considera- 
tions are relevant in the circumstances of 
this appeal. Therefore it is the Inquiry 
Officer’s view that the presumption ofan 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
has not been rebutted and the records 
qualify for exemption under section 
49(b) of the Act. However, in reviewing 
OHRC’s reasons for denying access to 
the handwritten complaint, the Inquiry 
Officer was given no indication that the 
OHRC considered the fact that similar 
personal information contained in the 
typewritten complaint was released by 
the OHRC under the Act. Accordingly, 
the Officer found that the OHRC has 
not properly exercised its discretion 
under section 49(b) in respect of the 
handwritten complaint.

compliance investigation ~ inquiry 


The Ministry of Health received a re- 
quest for access to all records relating to 
and arising from four compliance inves- 
tigations which were undertaken by the 
Office of the Information and Privacy 
Commissioner/Ontario between May 
11, 1992 and June 30, 1992. The inves- 
tigations were undertaken in response to 
complaints by the requester. The records 
consisted of letters, memoranda, notes 
and telephone messages related to the 
investigations of the requester’s com- 
plaints. The Ministry denied access to 
the records pursuant to the privilege 
created by section 52(9) of the Act. The 
requester, through his agent, appealed 
the denial of access and questioned the 
adequacy of the Ministry’s search. 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 


records. 


The only issue in the appeal was whether 
the privilege provided by section 52(9) 
extends to records created in the course of 
the compliance investigation undertaken 


by this office. 
In order to discharge the responsibility of 


ensuring compliance with the privacy 
protection provisions of the Acz, the

INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Office of the Information and Privacy 
Commissioner/Ontario conducts inves- 
tigations into compliance matters. These 
investigations frequently occur asa result 
of complaints received from members of 
the public who feel the government has 
improperly collected, retained, used or 
disclosed their personal information. 


The privilege afforded to records by sec- 
tion 52(9) extends only to records which 
are supplied or produced in the course of 
an inquiry by the Office of the Informa- 
tionand Privacy Commissioner/Ontatrio. 
The inquiry process is set in motion 
when an appeal is filed pursuant to sec- 
tion 50(1) by a person who has made an 
access to information request or a correc- 
tion of personal information request. A 
compliance investigation undertaken by 
the Office of the Information and Pri- 
vacy Commissioner/Ontario is not an 
inquiry for the purposes of the Act and 
records which are produced in the course 
of a compliance investigation are not 
records produced in the course of an 
inquiry pursuant to section 52(1). Ac- 
cordingly, the privilege described in 
section 52(9) does not extend to the 
records at issue in this appeal. 


In its representations, the Ministry indi- 
cated that it has considered all of the 
exemptions contained in the Act and 
found that none applied. Because the 
Ministry has not claimed any of the 
discretionary exemptions, it is not neces- 
sary for the Inquiry Officer to consider 
their application. The Inquiry Officer 
reviewed the records and, in her view, the 
mandatory exemptions contained in the 
Act do not apply.

activities. The Ministry released some 
records and denied access to others, 
either in whole or in part, pursuant to 
sections 14, 17 and 21 of the Act. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Ministry was par- 
tially upheld. 


Some of the records contain personal 
information of individuals other than the 
requester. The Ministry submits that 
disclosure of personal information con- 
tained in the records is presumed to 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy because it was compiled 
and is identifiable as part of an inves- 
tigation into a possible violation of law 
(section 21(3)(b)). The information was 
gathered and/or created during the Min- 
istry’s investigation of allegations of un- 
fair business practices by the requester’s 
companies under the Business Practices 
Act (the BPA). The Inquiry Officer 
accepted the arguments of the Ministry 
and found that the requirements for a 
presumed unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy under section 21(3)(b) had 
been satisfied. The record does not 
contain any information that pertains to 
section 21(4) which could operate to 
rebuta presumption undersection 21 (3). 
There is no combination of factors under 


section 21(2) which favours disclosure of 
the record in the circumstances of this 
appeal. Therefore, the records are prop- 


erly exempt. 


The Ministry also claims that certain 
portions of the record qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 14(1)(d), which 
allows the head to refuse to disclose a 
record where the disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to disclose the 
identity of a confidential source of 
information in respect of a law enforce- 
ment matter. 


In order for record to qualify for exemp- 
tion under this section that matter to 
which the record relates must relate to law 
enforcement. The BPA provides that 
any individual or corporation is subject 
toa penalty if found guilty of engaging in 
an unfair business practice. Therefore, 
the investigative process under the BPA 
satisfies the requirements of the defini- 
tion of law enforcement. Investigations 
that are conducted under the authority of 
the BPA lead or could lead to proceed- 
ings inacourt or tribunal wherea penalty 
or sanction could be imposed. In order 
to establish confidentiality under section 
14(1)(d) of the Act, the Ministry must 
provide evidence of the circumstances in 
which the information was given. The 
Ministry provided the description of these 
circumstances and also a description of 
law enforcement process under the BPA 
and its practices in conducting such in- 
vestigations. The Inquiry Officer found 
that in the circumstances of this appeal, 
disclosure of the records could reason- 
ably be expected to disclose the identities 
of confidential sources of information. 
Therefore, the records qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 14(1)(d).

APPEAL P-9200306 

Institution: Stadium Corporation of Ontario 
Limited 

~ JANUARY 29, 1993 

(COMMISSIONER WRIGHT) 


KEYWORDS 
fees * estimate * notice to parties by head 
¢ content of decision letter * interim notice 


The Stadium Corporation of Ontario 
Limited (SkyDome) received a request 
for access to any 1990 and 1991 consult- 
ant reports. SkyDome responded with a 
fee estimate in the amount of $150. The 
requester appealed the fee estimate. 
The sole issue for the Commissioner to 
determine was whether SkyDome prop- 
erly discharged its obligations under the 
Act when responding to the appellant's 


T equest. 


ORDER 
SkyDome was ordered to issue a final 
decision letter within 20 days. 


_ In the vast majority of cases, when in 
_ receipt of a request, institutions will re- 
spond with a decision letter regarding 
access anda fee estimate, ifany, within 30 
days of receipt of the request. Only in 
certain limited circumstances will the 
institution be permitted to rely on sec- 
tion 27 (a time extension) or issue an 
interim notice of decision. In the cir- 
- cumstances of this appeal, the letter by 

SkyDomein response to the request does 
not appear to conform with any of 3 
possible types of responses. SkyDome’s 
decision letter and its representations did 
not provide sufficient evidence for the 
Commissioner to conclude that 
SkyDome finds itselfin a situation which 
would support the use of section 27 or an 
_ interim notice. The Commissioner found 
that the requirements of section 26 apply, 
and upon receipt of the request SkyDome 


should have issued a final decision on 
access to the appellant within 30 days of 
receiving the request. 


The Commissioner pointed out that a 
number of previous orders have discussed 
requirements for the content of a final 
decision letter. A copy of the June 1992 
issue of IPC Practices, which dealt with 
the requirements of a proper decision 
letter, was enclosed with a copy of the 
order sent to SkyDome.

The Thunder Bay Police Force received 
a request for access to information related 
toan investigation of an assault allegation 
arising from an incident which occurred 
in 1987. The police determined that the 
records responsive to part of the request 
would be held by the Ministry of the 
Attorney General. Accordingly, the po- 
lice transferred this part of the request to 
the Ministry. The Ministry responded to 
the request by granting access to several 
records and denying access to others, 
either in whole or in part, pursuant to 


sections 13, 19 and 49(a) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Ministry was upheld. 


All of the records, with the exception of 
one severance, contain the personal in- 
formation of the requester and his mother, 
the victim of the alleged assault. This one 
severance contains the address and tel- 
ephone number of an individual whose 
name has already been disclosed to the 
appellant. This information is personal 
information of that individual only. 


Section 49(a) of the Act gives the head 
discretion to refuse to disclose to the 
individual to whom the information 
relates, personal information where sec- 


tions 13 or 19 would apply. 


The Ministry claims that section 19 ap- 
plies to all the records. In order to qualify 
under Branch 2 of the section 19 exemp- 
tion, two criteria must be satisfied. The 
record must be prepared by or for Crown 
counsel and the record must have been 
prepared for use in giving legal advice, or 
in contemplation of litigation or for use 
in litigation. The records consist of 
correspondence between various Crown 
attorneys in the context of a review of a 
decision not to lay charges pertaining 
to the alleged assault. In the Inquiry 
Officer’s view, all the records satisfy 
the requirements for exemption under 
Branch 2 of the section 19 exemption. 


Section 21(1) of the Act prohibits the 
disclosure of personal information of one 
individual to another individual, unless 
the disclosure does not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
(section 21(1)(f)). The personal infor- 
mation of the individual other than the 
requester was compiled by the police in 
the course ofan investigation pursuant to 
the Criminal Code and, therefore, the 
requirements for a presumed unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy under sec- 
tion 21(3)(b) have been established. None 
of the circumstances outlined in section 
21(4) operate to rebut the presumption. 
In addition, there is no combination of 


23

factors listed in section 21(2) which will 
operate to rebutthe presumption. There- 
fore, disclosure of the information would 
result in an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy.

The Ministry received a request for access 
to unit prices of the successful bidders in 
a specific tender call for the supply of 
cleaning and janitorial materials to the 
Ministry. The Ministry granted access to 
the names of the three successful bidders 
and the total contract prices, but refused 
access to unit prices of specific items, 
claiming sections 17(1)(a) and (c) of the 
Act. The requester appealed the decision. 
The record consists of the following in- 
formation: an itemized list of products; 
a description of each item on the list; the 
unit cost of each item on the list. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Ministry was upheld. 


For a record to qualify for exemption 
under secticn 17(1)(a) or (c), the Minis- 
try or the companies supplying the bids 
must satisfy each part of a 3-part test. 


The information contained in the records 
relates to the sale and purchase of goods 


24 


and outlines the companies’ offers to 
supply the Ministry with the janitorial 
and cleaning products at a specific unit 
price. This information is commercial 
and meets the first part of the test. 


The Ministry provided information about 
its tendering process and stated in its 
representations that it has always been 
the policy and practice of the Ministry to 
treat unit price quotations as confiden- 
tial. Therefore, the information was sup- 
plied in confidence and the second part 
of the test is met. 


One of the companies that submitted a 
bid stated that its relationship with its 
ownsuppliers could besignificantly preju- 
diced if purchase arrangements become 
public information. The company ne- 
gotiated special prices for this contract 
and asa result the Ministry obtained the 
benefit of lower prices. The company’s 
suppliers provided the special prices in 
confidence and under theagreementthat 
they would not be revealed. The Minis- 
try argued that in the hands ofa competi- 
tor, the unit price information would 
present an economic advantage in the 
competition for future business contracts 
because the competitor would be in the 
position to adjust their prices or under 
bid in order to present more attractive 


bid offers. 


After reviewing the representation of the 
parties and the contents of the records, 
the Inquiry Officer was satisfied that 
there was sufficient evidence to indicate 
that disclosure of the records could rea- 
sonably be expected to significantly 
prejudice the competitive position of 
the companies which submitted bids. 
Therefore, all 3 parts of the test were 
madeand the mandatory exemption pro- 


vided by section 17(1)(a) applied.

Stadium Corporation of Ontario Ltd. 
(SkyDome) received a request for access 


-to certain agreements and related records 


referred to in a November 14, 1991 
announcement made by SkyDome. 
SkyDome advised the requester that an 
estimated fee of $360 was being 
charged for manual search time required 
to process the request and asked the 
requester to pay a deposit of $180 before 
the request would be processed. The 
requester appealed SkyDome’s decision 


regarding the fee estimate and asked for 


any fee to be waived. 


ORDER 

The Assistant Commissioner did not 
uphold SkyDome’s decision to charge a 
fee for processing the appellant’s request. 
SkyDomewas ordered to providea proper 
decision letter in response to the appel- 
lant’s original request within 15 days of 
the date of the order. 


In its representations, SkyDome merely 
stated that the $360 represented “time 
spent manually searching for the record 
in addition to two hours ata rate of $7.50 
for each additional 15 minute spent”. 


In the Assistant Commissioner's view, 


the evidence provided by SkyDome in ~ 


support of its fee estimate is not sufficient — 


to substantiate its claim. SkyDome’s rep-

garding where the search was held, the 
volume of the records or other factors 
which would enable the Assistant Com-

accordance with the provisions of section 
57(1)(a). The Assistant Commissioner 
found that the amount of the estimated

request.

The Ministry of Consumer & Commer- 
cial Relations received a request for access 
to a copy of a 1989 report filed by the 
Cemeteries Branch of the Ministry re- 
garding the Fort Erie Cemetery. The 
Ministry provided access to two pieces of 
correspondence, and denied access to 
other records claiming section 14(2)(a). 
The undisclosed records consist of two 
internal memoranda. The first memo- 
randum is from an investigator in the 
Ministry's Investigations and Enforce- 
ment branch to theacting manager of the 
branch concerning an investigation of 
alleged irregularities at the Fort Erie Cem- 
etery. [hesecond memorandum is dated 
approximately 2 years later and is from 
the same investigator to the manager of 
the branch and is a summary of the first 


memorandum. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Ministry was upheld. 


The Ministry submits that it has the 
discretion not to disclose the records 
because they are reports prepared in the 
course of law enforcement, inspections 
or investigations by an agency which has 
the function of enforcing and regulating 
compliance with a law (section 14(2)(a)). 
In order fora record to qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 14(2)(a), the Ministry 
must satisfy each part of a 3-part test. 
Each record qualifies as a report as it 
consists of summaries of the investiga- 
tion of alleged violations of the Cemeter- 
ies Act, findings of fact by the investiga- 
tor, conclusions about the validity of 
complaints and recommendations as to 
the alternatives to deal with the matter. 
Further, the records were prepared in the 
course of investigations conducted pur- 
suant to the Cemeteries Act for the pur- 
pose of determining if grounds existed 
for prosecution under the Cemeteries Act. 
In addition, the records were prepared by 
an investigator with the Investigations 
and Enforcement branch of the Ministry 
which has the function of enforcing and 
regulating compliance with the Cemeter- 
ies Act. Therefore, all parts of the 3-part 
test are met and the records qualify for 
exemption pursuant to section 14(2)(a)

The Township received two requests for 
access to records. The first request was

consisted of seven parts. The second 
request was for access to records regard- 
ing roads, building permits, properties, 
property owners, township council mem- 
bers, records of the requesters meeting 
with the council and correspondence 
regarding the requester. The Township 
charged a fee of 40 cents for photocopy- 
ing responsive records. In response to 
one part of thesecond request, the Town- 
ship issued a fee estimate of $190 for a 
search time and photocopying respon- 
sive records. The requester asked for a 
waiver of fees on the grounds that a 
waiver would be in the public interest. 
The Township denied the appellants 
request for a fee waiver. The requester 
appealed the Townships calculation of 
the fees and the decision not to waive the 
amount of the fees. 


ORDER 
The Township’s decision was upheld. 


The Township is entitled to charge fees 
for costs incurred in circumstances out- 
lined in section 45(1). The search charge 
has been calculated in accordance with 
section 6(3) of regulation 823 and is 
authorized under section 45(1)(a). In 
accordance with section 6(1) of regula- 
tion 823 and section 45(1)(b), the Town- 
ship is authorized to charge 20 cents per 
page for photocopying. 


The appellant has not demonstrated that 
there will be any benefit to the public 
and, in particular, no benefit to public 
health and safety, by the dissemination of 
records relating to a property matter. 
Therefore, the appellant has not dis- 
charged the burden of proving that the 
Township’s decision not to waive the fee 
under 45(4) of the Act was not in 
accordance with the terms of the Act.

The Conservation Authority (the Au- 
thority) received a request for access to 
information regarding groups of 100 or 
more persons that have had parties, pic- 
nics or other corporate functions in the 
past three years at the Authority’s recrea- 
tional facilities. The Authority denied 
access to all responsive records claiming 
sections 1 1(c) and (d) of the Act. During 
mediation, the appellant agreed to 
narrow his request to certain infor- 
mation from picnic permits, namely, the 
company names and addresses and 
expected number of attendees for permits 
issued to corporate groups of 100 or more 
for the years 1989, 1990 and 1991. The 
parties agreed to proceed by way of a 
representative sample. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Authority was up- 
held. 


The Authority isa corporate body consti- 
tuted under the Conservation Authority 
Act of Ontario, empowered to operate 
recreational and other park facilities for 
the benefit of the public. F unding for its 
recreational activities comes directly from 
admission charges and other revenues 
raised during the course of operating the 
- facilities. Although these activities are 
subsidized by local municipalities, the 


26 


Authority must rely increasingly on the 
additional revenues it generates in the 
various recreational areas and facilities 
from food services, gift shops and fees for 
various educational programs. 


The fact that the appellant is providing 
different services from those offered by 
the Authority is not determinative. The 
portions of the record sought by the 
appellant are, in effect, a mailing list of 
the Authority’s corporate clients, and as 
such, have an intrinsic value to the Au- 
thority. This information is essential to 
the Authority’s marketing and promot- 
ing of its services and is used to generate 
income. There can be no guarantee that 
the list, once released, would not be sold 
or passed on to other companies or indi- 
viduals that are in direct competition 
with the Conservation Authority. There- 
fore, disclosure could reasonably be ex- 
pected to prejudice the economic interest 
of the Conservation Authority and the 
records are properly exempt from disclo- 
sure pursuant to section 11(c) of the Act.

The Police received a request for access to 
information regarding the existence of 
criminal records for four individuals. 
The Police refused to confirm or deny 
the existence of any responsive records 
pursuant to section 14(5) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Police was upheld. 


A record of the nature requested by the 
appellant, if it exists, would contain the 
criminal history of four identifiable indi- 
viduals and clearly qualifies as personal 
information of these individuals as de- 
fined by section 2(1) of the Act. 


- Simply confirming the existence of any 


responsive records could reveal personal 
information about an identifiable indi- 
vidual in the circumstances of this ap- 
peal. The record ofa criminal conviction 
is not information which is compiled as 
part ofan investigation; rather itisa result 
of either a guilty plea or a conviction by 
a court, which by their very nature are 
events which take place after any investi- 
gation has been completed. Therefore, a 
responsive record, should it exist, would 
not satisfy the requirements of section 
14(3)(b). Because none of the other 
types of information listed in section 
14(3) would apply, there is no presumed 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 


The appellant has not provided sufficient 


evidence to establish that disclosure of 


the criminal record of an individual, if it 
exists, would promote public health and 
safety (section 14(2)(b)). The existence 
of a criminal record is properly consid- 
ered as “highly sensitive” and section 
14(2)(f) isarelevantconsideration. There- 
fore, the disclosure of the criminal record 
of an individual, if it exists, would consti- 
tute an unjustified invasion of the 
personal privacy of the person to whom 
the information relates.

Although the existence of a particular 
criminal conviction is a matter of public 
record, and this fact would have been 
disclosed to the public during a trial or a 
plea taken in open court, it does not 
necessarily follow that this information 
should be freely and easily available to 
anyone who asks. The appellant might, 
through diligence and investigation, be 
able to determine ifany of the individuals 
named in her request do have a criminal

_ that an easily retrievable computerized 
record of all criminal convictions, if it 
exists, should be disclosed to the 
appellant. 


The Police have provided sufficient evi-

existence or non existence of a criminal

constitute an unjustified invasion of 


their personal privacy.

denying access to part of the record 


pursuant to section 6(1)(b), 7(1) and

ORDER 
The Township’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


In its representations, the Township has 


not cited or made reference to the ap- ~ 


plication of section 6(1)(b) to any part 
of the record. Therefore, this exemption 
will not be considered in the context of 


the appeal. 


Harm to the competitive position of the 
Township should beaddressed bya claim 
pursuant to section 11 of the Act, not 
section 10. The Township did not iden- 
tify any page of the record disclosure of 
which might harm its competitive 
position and, accordingly, neither 
section 10 nor 11 will be considered. 


The Township did not make reference 
to the application of an exemption for 
certain pages of the record. As no 
mandatory exemption under the Act 
applies, these pages should be disclosed 
to the appellant. 


Some parts of the record consist only of 
factual background information and 
contain no suggested course of action. 
Therefore, those pages do not qualify 
for exemption under section 7(1). The 
remaining pages would reveal the advise 
and recommendations of consultants 
retained by the Township. Any factual 
information contained in these pages is 
so interwoven with the advise and rec- 
ommendations that it cannot reasonably 
be severed pursuant to section 4(2) of the 
Act. Because nothing in the record leads 
to the conclusion that, in aggregate, it 
constitutes a “feasibility study or other 
technical study”, section 7(2)(f) and (g) 
do not apply to any of the remaining 


Pages. 


In the circumstances of this appeal, there 
isno compelling public interest sufficient 
to outweigh the purpose of section 7(1) 
of the Act. 


Not all communications between a legal 
advisor and his/her client are privileged. 
Some pages of the record qualify for 
exemption under section 12 having met 
all parts of the first test of branch one 
(common law solicitor-client privilege). 
None of the requirements for the second 
test (litigation privilege) have been met. 
The second part of the branch two test 
has not been met. The pages were not

in litigation.

The Nipissing Board of Education re- 
ceived a request from an individual act- 
ing as his wife’s agent, for access to four 
Board motions relating to his wife. The 
wording of the request was very specific 
and asks that the Board inform the re- 
quester if no such motions exist. The 
Board responded that it could only pro- 
cess the request for access to personal 
information from the individual towhom 


the information relates. However the 


28 


Board also went on to state that any 
responsive records were exempt under 
sections 6(1), 7(1) and 12 of the Act. The 


requester’s wife appealed the decision. 


ORDER 

The Assistant Commissioner disclosed 
the existence of the records which, are 
responsive to the appellant’s request and 
upheld the Boards decision that the 
records qualify for exemption under sec- 
tion 6(1)(b) of the Act. The Assistant 
Commissioner ordered the Board to prop- 
erly exercise its discretion under section 
38(a) and to provide further representa- 
tions concerning this exercise of discre- 
tion. 


Proper authorization to act as agent in a 
situation where personal information has 
been requested is a legitimate concern 
both for the Board and the Commission- 
er’s Office. The Actdoes not prohibit an 
individual from using an agent, nor does 
it require that authorization to act as 
agent be provided ina specific form. It is 
the Board’s responsibility to take what- 
ever steps are required to confirm that a 
person who purports to beacting asagent 
for another individual has the authority 
to act in this capacity. The Board has an 
obligation under section 21 of the Act 
to notify the individual whose personal 
information is at issue and provide him 
or her with an opportunity to provide 
representations prior to any decision re- 
garding disclosure being made. In the cir- 
cumstances of this appeal, a written au- 
thorization from the requester’s wife was 
provided to the Board. Ifthe Board was 
not satisfied with this evidence of agency, 
it could have taken steps to confirm the 
authorization. For the purposes of the 
appeal, the Assistant Commissioner felt 
that he had been provided with sufficient 
evidence to establish that the appellant’s 
husband was duly authorized to actas her 


agent. 


In responding to the request, the Board 
did not raise section 22(b); rather, it 
made an objection regarding the status of 
the requester and went on to raise sec- 
tions 6, 7 and 12 of the Actas grounds for 
denying access. The Board’s concern 
regarding confirmation of the existence 
of records was not raised until the inquiry 
stage of the appeal and has never been 
communicated to the appellant as re- 
quired by section 22(2). 


The Board has not claimed either section 
8 or 14as the basis for denying access and 
these are the only exemptions contained 
in the Actwhich entitle an institution to 


refuse to confirm or deny the existence of 


records. The Board’s attempt to refuse to 
confirm or deny the existence of the 
records must fail and the Assistant Com- 
missioner confirmed that the records 
exist which are responsive to paragraphs 
two and four of the request and that no 
records exist which are responsive to 


paragraphs one and three. 


The information contained in both — 


records relates to the appellant’s previous 
employment with the Board and as such 


qualifies as the personal information of — 


the appellant under section 2(1) of the 
Act. Both records satisfy the require- 
ments of the test for exemption under 
section 6(1)(b). The records make refer- 
ence to the fact that meetings of the 
Committee of the whole Board of Edu- 
cation took place. Section 207(2)(e) of 
the Education Act authorizes the Com- 


mittee of the whole Board to meet in — 


camera when the subject matter under 
consideration involves litigation; the 


minutes establish that the issues under 
consideration of the two meetings in- _ 


volve litigation between the Board and 
the appellant. The content of the min- 
utes establish that disclosure of the records 


would reveal the actual substance of de- _ 
liberation of this in camera meeting. 


ae, 


Because the Assistant Commissioner _ 


i,

AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


found that the contents of the record 
qualify as personal information of the 
appellant and that both records qualify 
for exemption under section 6(1)(b), 
section 38(a) gives the Board the discre- 
tion to exempt the records from disclo- 
sure. 


A proper exercise of discretion under 
section 38(a) must be made in full appre- 
ciation of the facts of the case and upon 
application of proper legal principles. 
Provided that discretion has been exer- 
cised in accordance with established legal 
principles it should not be disturbed on 
appeal.

The Township received a request for 
access to the building permit for a boat- 
house. The Township granted access toa 
number of records, including a building 
permit for the renovation of the boat- 
house. The requester sought access to the 
original building permit. The Township 
advised the requester that the original 
building permit did not exist. 


ORDER 
The Township’s search was reasonable in 
the circumstances. 


In its representations, the Township out- 
lines the steps taken by its employees to 
locate the requested records, including: a 
search of the computerized records man- 
agementsystem of current records, which 
includes all building permits; a search of 
the computerized records management 
system of all destroyed files, which in- 
cludes building permits; a visual review 
of all existing building permits; a review 
of all “building permit reports” submit-

all records destroyed between 1974 and 
1979; and a review of the “file destruc-

between 1979 and 1990. 


Additional searches were conducted by 
the Township’s Deputy Clerk and the 
Records Clerk who were unable to find 
any indication of the issuance of a build- 
ing permit to construct about house on 


~ the property. The steps taken were veri- 


fied by affidavit evidence which describes 
the search in detail and provides support-

The Metropolitan Toronto Police Sery- 


ices Board received a request for access to 
“such information to which I might be 


30 


entitled under the Municipal Freedom of 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act.” 
The requester supplied his name, date 
and place of birth, social insurance 
numberand the name of the company he 
owned. The same requester submitted a 
second request to the Public Complaints 
Commissioner (the PCC) for access to 
any information relating to a complaint 
he had filed with that organization. The 
second request was transferred by the 
PCC to the Police pursuant to section 


18(3) of the Act. 


All pages of the record relating to appeal 
M-910217 are also included in appeal 
M-910167, with the exception of one 
page. Therefore, the two appeals have 
been combined. 113 pages were released 
to the requester in their entirety, access to 
the remaining pages was denied, in whole 
or in part, pursuant to section 8 and 
section 14 and 38 of the Act. 


Part of the record contained a number of 
indicators which suggest that the report 
had already been released to the appel- 
lant, including a notation on the bottom 
of the final report that includes the appel- 
lant on the distribution list for the report. 
Therefore, these pages do not qualify for 
exemption and should be disclosed to the 
appellant in their entirety. 


The records consist of notes, letters, a 
computer printout, “reports”, forms, ex- 
cerpts from Police Officers’ notebooks 
and an officer complaint summary. All 
of the records relate to a complaint made 
by the appellant to the Police regarding a 
threatening telephone message he re- 
ceived anda subsequent complaint made 
by the appellant to the PCC about the 
conduct of the Police Officer in charge of 
the investigation. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Police was partially 
upheld. 


All of the pages at issue contain personal 
information of either the appellant, one 
or more of the affected persons, or both 
the appellant and one or more of the 
affected persons. Section 38 provides a 
number of exceptions to the general right 
of access found in section 36 of the Act. If 
the Police determine that release of the 
information would constitute an unjus- 
tified invasion of the affected persons 
personal privacy, section 38(b) gives the 
Police the discretion to deny the 
appellant access to his own personal 
information. 


Sections 14(2) and 14(3) of the Act pro- 
vide guidance in determining whether 
the disclosure of the personal informa- 
tion contained in the record would con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy. All except three pages of the 
record were compiled and are identifi- 
able as part of an investigation into a 
possible violation of law (section 
14(3)(b)). Therefore, the presumption 
of an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy applies. No combination of fac- 
tors listed in section 14(2) would operate 
to rebut the presumptions. One affected 
person has consented to the disclosure of 
her personal information. Because no 
provisions of section 8 have been claimed 
by the Police as the basis for exempting 
this information, it should be released to 


the appellant in its entirety. The infor- - 
mation which relates to the appellant — 
only does not qualify for exemption un- — 
der section 8(2)(a), therefore, the exemp- | 

tion provided by section 38(a) of the Act 


is not available. Personal information of 


individuals other than the requester and — | 


the affected person was not disclosed.

reasonable steps to locate record * record

In November, 1992, Assistant Commis- 
sioner Mitchinson issued Interim Order 
M-59 in respect of this appeal. This 
order is the Assistant Commissioner’s 
final order and addresses all matters 
which were unresolved at the time of the 
issuance of Interim Order M-59. 


The appellant originally requested access 
to a copy of the entire correspondence 
and inspection files and any other corre- 
spondence in the possession of the City 
of Peterborough regarding a named ad- 
dress, including the dates and times that 
anamed Fire Prevention Officer inspected 
and visited the address. The City dis- 
closed 14 responsive records to the appel- 
lant. The appellant was notsatisfied with 
this response and appealed the City’s 
decision claiming that additional records 
should exist. In Interim Order M-59 the 
Assistant Commissioner ordered the City 
- to provide him with an affidavit attesting 
to the records which were released to the 
appellant and the nature of the searches 
conducted to determine whether addi- 
tional responsive records exist. The City 
issued a decision with respect to 53 pages 
of notes and diary entries of Fire Preven- 
tion Officers disclosing all parts of these 
records which were responsive to the 
request. The only remaining issue is 
whether or not the City’s search for 
additional records was reasonable in the 
circumstances. 


ORDER 
The search conducted by the City was 


reasonable in the circumstances. 


The City submitted a sworn affidavit by 
theemployee who conducted thesearches 
for additional responsive records. The 
affidavit outlines the scope of the various 
searches, which included a manual search 
of all relevant files to the Fire Depart- 
ment Offices and various consultations 
with city employees who would be 
familiar with the matter.

The Township of Maidstone received a 
request for a copy ofa report prepared by 
a consulting firm relating to the town- 
ship staffing systems. The Township 
denied access to the record in its entirety 
claiming section 11(f) of the Act. The 
requester appealed the Township’s 


decision. 


ORDER 

The Township was ordered to disclose 
portions of the record which do not 
contain personal information. 


Section 42 of the Actstates that where an 
institution covered by the Act denies 
access to a record or part of a record, the 
burden of proof that the record or part 
falls within one of the specified exemp- 
tions lies upon the institution. The 
Township has given no reasons and pro- 
vided no evidence in support of its claim 
that the exemption applies to the record. 


Ithas merely provided a blanketassertion 
that an exemption applies, without facts 
or arguments to support the claim. In 
Inquiry Officer Seife’s view, this was not 
sufficientto discharge the burden of proof. 
In the absence of representations from 
the Township, Inquiry Officer Seife ex- 
amined the record itself. The record did 
not contain the sort of detailed method, 
scheme or design that are characteristic of 
a plan. Establishing that the record 
contains a plan is the first part of three 
part test which must be met in order to 
qualify for exemption under section 
11(1)(b). Because the record does not 
contain a plan or plans, the exemption 
found in section 11(f) does not apply.

In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 8(2)(a) a record must satisfy each 
part of a three part test. 


There is no dispute that the record is a 
report which was prepared in the course 
of law enforcement, inspections or in- 
vestigations. 
submits that because the investigation is 
over and no charges have been laid, there 
is no reason to believe that making the 
investigation public would endanger 
the prosecution of individuals who 
may have broken the law. 


The record meets all three parts of the 
three part test. Section 8(2)(a) does not 
require that a report meet additional 
criteria such as a reasonable expectation 
of some harm resulting from the disclo- 
sure of the report of specifications about 
the content thereof.

However, the appellant 


and also stated that he had not been 
provided with the original report pre-

police took the position that the report

ORDER 

The Inquiry Officer was satisfied that the 
police search for the report was reason- 
able. The Police were ordered to disclose 
the records to the requester. 


The names or signatures of various hos- 
pital personnel who cared for the request- 
er’s mother during the relevant period of 
time is not personal information, as it is 
information provided by an individual in 
a professional capacity or in the execu- 
tion of employment responsibilities. 
Because the Police had claimed only 
section 14 to exempt this information, 
and a prerequisite for the application of 
section 14 is that the information is 
found to be personal information, the 
information should be disclosed to the 
requester. 


The Police provided affidavit evidence 
describing their search for the original 
report which the requester believed ex- 
isted. The Inquiry Officer found that the 
searches conducted during the course of 
processing the request were thorough

The City of Hamilton received a request 
for access to records relating to the City’s 
investigation of the requester’s complaint 
of harassment. The City granted access 
toanumber records, however, access was 
denied to the remaining records pursu- 
ant to sections 10(1)(d), 14, 38(b) and 
(c). The requester appealed the City’s 


decision. Notice that an inquiry was 


being conducted was sent to two em- 
ployees named in the complaintas well as 
6 individuals whose names appeared in 
the records. 


ORDER 
The decision of the City was partially 
upheld. 


The records consist of notes, letters and 
memoranda created during the City’s 
investigation of the requester’s complaint. 
A small portion of the records contain 
information about other employees who 
worked in the area where the harassment 
allegedly took place. This information 
qualifies as the personal information of 
those individuals. Primarily, the records 
contain the personal information of the 
requester and the two individuals about 
whom he had complained. Some parts 
of the record do not contain personal 
information. 


The City claims that disclosure of per- 
sonal information will be presumed to 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy because the information 
relates to employment or educational 
history (14(3)(d)) and consists of per- 


sonal recommendations or evaluations 


(14(3)(g)). The Inquiry Officer found 


that the information which relates to 


_ individuals other than the requester can- 


not accurately be characterized as em- 
ployment history of any of these indi- 
viduals. The Inquiry Officer also found 
that while it could be argued that the 
comments of the author of the records 
are “evaluations”, it is not possible to 
characterize them as “personal” or “per- 
sonnel” evaluations of these individuals. 
The records were created to determine 
whether the actions of two individuals 
were in violation of the City’s policy on 
personal harassment. Therefore, neither 
section 14(3)(d) or (g) applies and there 
is no presumption ofan unjustified inva- 
sion of privacy. 


In order for section 14(2)(d) to be con- 
sidered a relevant factor, the requester 
must establish that the right in question 
is alegal right. With the exception of the 
grievance process, the rights referred to 
by the requester are not concepts of 
common or statute law. 


The City and the individuals accused of 
harassment state that the information 
should not be released because it is highly 
sensitive (section 14(2)(f) and was sup- 
plied in confidence (section 14(2)(h)). 
Although, the parties involved may find 
discussion of work place relationships 
and conduct in relation to an investiga- 
tion distressing in nature, it is not possi- 
ble for such an investigation to proceed if 
the complaint is not made known to the 
respondent and the direct response to the 
allegations is not made known to the 
complainant. Accordingly, the Inquiry 
Officer found that section 14(2)(f) is 
only a relevant consideration in respect 
of information provided by individuals 
other than the requester and those 
accused of harassment. 


The Inquiry Officer found that section 


14(2)(h) is not a relevant consideration

in respect of information provided by the 
persons accused of harassment in direct

workplace. Ifa party to a complaint is to

whom, to enable them to address the 


validity of the allegations. 


Disclosure of information provided by 
individuals other than the parties to the 
complaint would constitute an unjusti- 
fied invasion of personal privacy and 
section 38(b) applies. Disclosure of 
information provided by the requester 
and the information provided by those 
accused of harassment in response to 
the complaint would not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
and section 38(b) does not apply. 


The City also argued that it has the 
discretion to refuse to-disclose to the 
requester information which relates to 
the requester that is evaluative or opinion 
material compiled solely for the purpose 
of determining suitability, eligibility or 
qualifications for employment (section 
38(c)). Parts of the record do contain 
evaluative and opinion material about 
the requester, however, the Inquiry 
Officer did not accept that the sole pur- 
pose for compiling the information was 
to determine the requester’s suitability, 
eligibility or qualifications for employ- 
ment. The only purpose for compiling the 
information was to investigate the 
complaint. 


The City also argued that it had discre- 
tion not to disclose a record that could be 
reasonably expected to reveal informa- 
tion supplied to resolve a labour relations 
dispute. The introductory wording of 


34 


section 10(1) requires that the informa- 
tion must have been supplied to the City 
bya third party which by definition is not 
part of the institution. The City’s em- 
ployees are part of the institution and, 
therefore, do not qualify as third parties 
for the purposes of section 10. Although 
former employees are not part of the 
institution and might be considered third 
parties, their interests are more ap- 
propriately addressed under the privacy 
protection provisions of the Act.

APPEAL M-910297 
Institution: Town of Gravenhurst 
FEBRUARY 10, 1993 

(ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER MITCHINSON) 


KEYWORDS 
advice to government ° solicitor client 


privilege 


The Town of Gravenhurst received a 
request to examine an Ontario Munici- 
pal Board (OMB) file regarding a named 
establishment. The Town granted access 
to all but seven records and denied access 
to these records in their entirety pursuant 
to sections 7(1) and 12. The requester 
appealed the Town’s decision and also 


raised the possible application of sections 


50(2) and 51(1) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The Town was ordered to disclose the 
records. 


Section 7(1) of the Act grants the head 
discretion to refuse to disclose a record if 
the disclosure would reveal advice or 
recommendation of an officer or an em- 
ployee of an institution or a consultant 


retained by the institution. The record 
for which the Town claimed section 7 
consists of handwritten notes made by 
the Town’s Director of Planning about 
the Public Works Superintendent’s con- 
cerns about the subject of the OMB 
hearing. The other record consists of two 
zoning analyses and a chronological 
record of communications between the 
Town and other persons involved in the 
hearing. The Town acknowledged that 
neither record would reveal specific advice 
or recommendations. Generally speak- 
ing, advice pertains to the submission of 
a suggested course of action, which will 
ultimately be accepted or rejected by its 
recipient during the deliberative process. 
In the Assistant Commissioner's view, 
neither record contained information 
which could be properly considered to be 


“advice”. 


The Town claimed that notes created by 
the Town’s Director of Planning during 
the course of the OMB hearing, should 
be exempt because they are subject to 
solicitor-client privilege or were prepared 
for counsel employed or retained by the 
Town for use in giving legal advice or in 
contemplation or for use in litigation 
(section 12). The notes fail to satisfy the 
requirements for exemption under 
solicitor-client privilege. There is insuffi- 
cient evidence to establish that the records 
were actually communicated between 
the Town and its legal advisor, nor do the 
Town’s representations established that 
the records are of a confidential nature. 
The Townalso failed to establish that any 
of the records were created or obtained 
for a lawyer’s brief. The Town has not 
provided sufficient evidence to establish 
that the records were prepared specifi- 
cally for counsel or that the Town’s 
solicitor used the records in providing 


legal advice to the Town. 


Because none of the records qualified for 
exemption under the Act, it was not

The Police received.a request for access to 
the record of an investigation of an as- 
sault upon the requester at her place of 
employment. The Police granted partial 
access to the records. Access was denied 
- to certain information pursuant to sec- 
tions 8(1)(1), 8(2)(a), 14 and 38(b) of the 
_ Act. The information severed from the 
record consists of the name, occupation, 
business telephone number, gender, race, 
height, weight, hair colour, eye colour 
and condition of the person accused of 
the assault as well as the information 
provided to the police by that person. 
The severed information also includes 
names of witnesses and information 
provided by one witness and an inter- 
nal police report classification code. 


‘ ORDER 
The decision of the Police was partially 
upheld. 


The name, occupation, business tele- 
phone number, etc. of the person ac- 
cused of the assault, as well as other 
information provided by that person, 
qualify as that person’s personal informa- 
tion. The name and occupation of each 
witness qualifies as the personal informa- 
tion of the witness. The information 
provided by the witness qualifies as 
personal information of the witness, the 
person accused of the assault and the 
requester. 


During the course of the inquiry, the 
person accused of the assault consented 
to the release of some of her personal 
information to the requester. Therefore, 
section 14(1)(a) applies and the manda- 
tory exemption from disclosure does not 
apply to the information which that per- 
son has consented to disclose. The only 
parts of the record remaining at issue are 
the name and occupation of the wit- 
nesses, certain information about the 
person accused of the assault and certain 
information provided by that person. 


The Inquiry Officer was satisfied that the 
personal information of the person ac- 
cused of assault and the witness was 
compiled and is identifiable as part of an 
investigation and therefore section 
14(3)(b) applies. Section 14(4) is not 
relevant to rebut the presumption in the 
circumstances of this appeal. The re- 
quester submits that disclosure of the 
information is desirable for the purpose 
of subjecting the activities of the institu- 
tion to public scrutiny (section 14(2)(a)). 
In the Inquiry Officer’s view, the re- 
quester’s personal concerns about the 
reactions of one police officer are not 
sufficient to establish the relevance of 
section 14(2)(a). Although the requester 
claims the relevance of section 14(2)(c), 
this section was not intended to weigh in 
favour of the disclosure of personal infor- 
mation of another individual for the 
purpose of enabling someone to deter- 


mine specialization in the context of legal 
representation which he or she requires. 
The requester also states that disclosure 
of the personal information is relevant to 
a fair determination of her rights. How- 
ever, the requester has provided no infor- 
mation which indicates that the personal 
information she is seeking access to may 
have some bearing on the determination 
of the rights in question or is required to 
prepare for the proceeding or to ensure 
an impartial hearing. Therefore, section 
14(2)(d) is not a relevant consideration. 
Accordingly, the presumption of an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
is not rebutted, 


The Police claim section 38(b) for those 
parts of the record which contained the 
personal information of the witnesses, 
the person accused of the assault and the 
requester. Because personal information 
was compiled and is identifiable as part of 
an investigation into a possible violation 
of law, the requirements for presumed 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
under section 14(3)(b) have been satis- 
fied. The requester raised the same argu- 
ments with regard to this information, 
and for the same reasons, the Inquiry 
Officer found that the presumption ofan 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
had not been rebutted. 


The Police submitted that they have the 
discretion to refuse to disclose a record 
that is a report prepared in the course of 
law enforcement (section 8(2)(a)). In 
order to qualify for exemption under 
section 8(2)(a),a record must satisfy each 
part ofa 3-part test. Because the pages for 
which the Police have claimed this ex- 
emption were prepared by a police officer 
in the course of his investigation of an 
alleged criminal event and consists of a 
formal statement or account of the 
results of the coalition and consideration 
of information. The requirements of 
the test have been met.

The Police received a request for access to 
information relating to an allegation that 
the requester’s client was improperly in 
possession of a firearm. The requester 
indicated in his request that he was in- 
formed by an Ontario Provincial Police 
(OPP) officer that a named member of 
the Police “was the source for the recent 
complaint” and asked the Police to pro- 
vide him with the information and docu- 
mentation in support of this complaint. 
The Police advised the requester that the 
officer had made no written report about 
the incident but rather he had relayed the 
information he had received from a con- 
fidential informant to the police agency 
responsible for the jurisdiction, namely, 
the OPP. The requester appealed the 
Police’s decision. During the appeal, the 
requester took the position that the Po- 
lice are required to provide him with the 
information he is seeking despite the fact 
that no written record of the incident was 
made by the officer, i.e. that the officer 
knows the name of the complainant but 
has not recorded it. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Police was upheld. 


The word record is defined in section 
2(1) of the Act as follows: “record” 
means any record of information however 
recorded, whether in printed form, on 


36 


film, by electronic means or otherwise, 
and includes, 


(a)correspondence, a memorandum, a _ 


book, a plan, a map, a drawing, a dia- 
gram, a pictorial graphic or work, a pho- 
tograph, a film a microfilm a sound 
recording, a videotape, a machine read- 
able record, any other documentary 
material, regardless of physical form or 
characteristics, and any copy thereof, and 


(b)subject to the regulations, any record 
that is capable of being produced from a 
machine readable record under the 
control of an institutions by means of 
computer hardware and software or any 
other information storage equipmentand 
technical expertise normally used by the 
institution; (“document”). 


The Act does not impose a specific 
duty on an institution to transcribe oral 
views, comments or discussions and it does 
not require an institution to pro- 
duce information from an individual's 
memory or knowledge. 


In his request, the requester asked for 
access to information relating to allega- 
tions that had been made against him. 
He was informed both by the Police and 
from the Information and Privacy 
Commissioner’s office that a record 
responsive to his request existed in the cus- 
tody or under the control of the OPP 
but the appellant continue to ask that the 
Police be required to create a record. 


In the Inquiry Officer’s view, there is no 
statutory obligation on the Police to re- 
spond to the request in any way different 
from the way they did. Although, 
the Police upon initially receiving the 
request should have forwarded it to the 
OPP, he found that the actions of the po- 
lice in responding to the request were 
reasonable and satisfactory in the circum- 
stances.

Duringan auditata social services agency 
funded by the Ministry, a Ministry em- 
ployee asked if she could randomly re- 
view several files of the developmentally 
disabled clients served by the agency. At 
first, the agency did not allow the Minis- 
try to access the client files. The agency’s 
concern was that the files contained highly 
sensitive information about the clients, 
such as family and medical history, and 
the Ministry had not obtained the cli-

ents written consent for access. 


During the review, the Ministry em- 
ployee made notes of program informa- 
tion only. She did not record clients’ 
names, nor did she remove or photocopy 
any file documents, 


The agency asked the IPC to review 


whether the Ministry was authorized 
under the Act to access the client files, 


38 


for program audit purposes, without 
the clients’ knowledge or consent. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the client files 
contained the clients’ personal informa- 
tion, as that term is defined in section 


2(1) of the Act. 


The IPC also concluded that the Minis- 
try had not collected the clients’ personal 
information, because the Ministry em- 
ployee had only reviewed the client files, 


without keeping anything personally 
identifiable. 


To determine if the Ministry was author- 
ized to access the client files, the IPC 
considered section 4(2) of Ontario Regu- 
lation 516/90. This section states that 
only those individuals who need a record 
for the performance of their duties shall 
have access to it. The IPC concluded that 
section 4(2) is restricted to records in the 
custody or control of the institution. 
Thus, beforethe IPC considered whether 
the Ministry had obtained access to the 
client files, according to the Act, it first 
considered whether the Ministry had 
custody or control of the client files. The 
IPC concluded that the Ministry did not 
have custody or control of the client files. 
Thus, section 4(2) of Ontario Regula- 
tion 516/90 did not apply to the Minis- 


try’s practices, in this case.

The complainant had filed two claims for 
benefits with the Workers’ Compensa- 
tion Board. The Board subsequently 
disclosed his medical information to his 
former employer through two decision 
letters. The Board also sent copies of 
these two letters to the complainant. The 
complainant felt that the Board was not 
entitled to disclose his medical informa- 
tion in a decision letter/report since he 
had signed a written objection to the 
disclosure of his medical information to 
his employer. He complained that this 
was a breach of his privacy and contrary 
to the Act. | 


The Board stated that it had disclosed the 
complainant’s personal information to

authority was section 72(2) of the

An employee filed a grievance with the 
Ministry regarding a job assignment he 
~ didnotget. The Ministry held a meeting 
with the employee, and two other em- 
ployees who had filed similar grievances, 
to try to resolve the matter. At the 
meeting the Ministry disclosed personal 
_ information -from the employee's per- 
formance appraisal, without his consent. 
The employee complained that this was 
a breach of his privacy, contrary to the 
Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The Ministry stated it was permitted to 
disclose the performance appraisal under 
section 42(b) of the Act. However, since 
the employee did not identify the per- 


formance appraisalin particularand con- 


sent to its disclosure, the IPC determined 
that the disclosure was not in compliance 


with section 42(b) of the Act. 


The Ministry also stated it was permitted 
to disclose the performance appraisal 
under section 42(c) of the Act, which 
allows a disclosure that is consistent with 
the purpose for which the information 
was compiled. The IPC found that the 
Ministry compiled the information in 
the performance appraisal for the pur- 
pose of human resource planning, and 
disclosed it for the purpose of resolving a 
grievance regarding a job assignment. 
The IPC found that the disclosure was 
for a consistent purpose. The employee 
also participated in the meeting by asking 
questions regarding his performance. 
Therefore, the IPC found that the em- 
ployee might reasonably have expected 
the Ministry to disclose the personal 
information in this case. The IPC con- 
cluded that disclosing the performance 
appraisal was permitted under section 


42(c) of the Act.

On September 19, 1990, a Solicitor of 
the Ministry senta letter with an attached 
“Statement of Claim” to a Senior Coun- 
sel with Correctional Services Canada. 
The Statement of Claim was filed in the 
Supreme Court of Ontario and named 
the complainant as one of the plaintiffs. 
According to thecomplainant, the Minis- 
try’s actions breached the use and 
disclosure provisions of the Act. 


CONCLUSION | 

The IPC determined that the letter con- 
tained information from the Statement 
of Claim and that both records 
contained the complainant’s personal 
information as defined in section 2(1) of 
the Act. However, Section 37 of the 
Act states: 


This part does not apply to personal 
information that is maintained for the 
purpose of creating a record that is avail- 


able to the general public. 


The Statement of Claim was part of a 
court file. Normally, court files are records 
that are available to the general public. In 
the circumstances of this case, the IPC 
was advised that there was no court order 
sealing the court file or otherwise inter- 
fering with the publication of any of the 
information in the court file. 


Therefore, section 37 of the Act applied 


to the circumstances of this case.

On December 6, 1988, a Management 
Intern of the Psychiatric Hospitals Branch 
sent an internal memorandum to the 
Branch Director about a patient. The 
memorandum stated, “In regards to hos- 
pital liaison with Corrections officials 
...the information shared deals only with 
any changes to his location...” and “In 
regards to the Board of Review's liaison 
with Corrections Canada, ... a copy of 
the Warrant is forwarded to Correc- 
tions,...” The patient complained to the 


39 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


IPC that the Ministry violated sections 
41(a) and (b) and section 42 of the Act, 
and sections 4(1) and (2) of the O. Reg. 
516/90, under the Act, when it disclosed 


information to Corrections Canada. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the Manage- 
ment Intern was referring to the Lieuten- 
ant Governor’s Board of Review (LGBR) 
in her memorandum. The Ministry and 
the LGBR are distinct institutions under 
the Act. Since the Ministry did not 
disclose the Lieutenant Governor’s War- 
rant to Corrections Canada, the IPC did 


not address this issue. 


With respect to the disclosure of the 
patient's location to Corrections Canada, 
the IPC determined that the location 
[address] of the patient was “personal 
information” as defined in section 2(1) 


of the Act. 


The IPC also determined that the disclo- 
sure of changes of the complainant's 
location [address] was in compliance with 
section 42(c) of the Act which permits 
disclosure where the disclosure is for “the 
purpose for which it was obtained or 
compiled or for a consistent purpose”. 


The complainant was a dual status of- 
fender and according to the Ministry, 
Corrections Canada was jointly respon- 
sible for his safe custody. Therefore, 
Corrections Canada had to be kept in- 
formed of any changes with respect to the 
terms and conditions of the Lieutenant 
Governor’s Warrant, which included 
the complainant’s address or location. 


Since the Ministry was required to dis- 
close the complainant’s location to Cor- 
rections Canada, it needed to use the 
complainant’s personal information. 
Thus, it was our view that the institution 
was in compliance with section 41(b) of 
the Act(ie. the institution used the infor- 


40 


mation for a consistent purpose). Since 
the Ministry was in compliance with 
section 41(b), it was not necessary to 
address whether section 41(a) was vio- 


lated. 


With respect to the complaint of unau- 
thorized access to records, the IPC deter- 
mined that the Management Intern was 
advising the Branch Director about the 
status of the complainant’s concerns and 
was drafting a response to those con- 
cerns. Therefore, the Management In- 
tern needed to access the record for the 
performance of her duties. It was our 
view that the Ministry, therefore, did not 
contravene section 4(2) of O. Reg. 516/ 
90. Since there was no unauthorized 
access to the personal information at 
issue, it was not necessary to address any 
remaining issues.

The complainant had filed a claim for 
benefits with the Board and was receiv- 
ing them. The complainant asked the 
Board to send him a paymentstatus letter 
which outlined the benefits he had re- 
ceived. The Board sent him this letter 
but also mailed a copy of this letter to his 
former employer. This letter stated that 
the complainant had received social as- 
sistance. Asa result, the employer found 
out that the complainant had received 
social assistance. The complainant had 
notconsented to this disclosure and wrote 
to the IPC that this was a breach of his 
privacy and contrary to the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the information that 
the complainant had received social as- 
sistance came within the Act’ definition 
of “personal information”. The IPC 
found that it was not necessary for the 
Board to disclose the fact that the com- 
plainant was in receipt of social assist- 
ance, to the employer. The employer 
only needed to know the amount of 
Board benefits which the complainant 
had received and for which the employer 
was responsible. Reimbursement of so- 
cial assistance benefits was a matter be- 
tween the complainant and the Board. 
The employer was not responsible for 
reimbursing these social assistance ben- 
efits. Asa result, the IPC concluded that 
the Board did not disclose the personal 
information for the purpose for which it 
was obtained or compiled or for a 
consistent purpose as authorized under 
section 42(c) of the Act. Asa result, 
the Board disclosed the complainant's 
receipt of social assistance contrary to 


the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The Board should not disclose, to an 
employer, the fact that a worker is in 
receipt of social assistance.

Advisory Review Board to an independ- 
ent tribunal. This amendment also 
changed the name of the LGRB to the 
Ontario Criminal Code Review Board 
(CCRB). Asa result, the CCRB inher- 
ited all records of the LGRB. A patient in 
a psychiatric facility complained that the 
LGRB transferred all records, including 
his “personal information” to the CCRB 
contrary to the provisions of the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

Section 619 of the Criminal Code was 
repealed and replaced by section 672. 
Section 672 provided for the establish- 
ment of the CCRB. Section 672.38(2) 
provided that a Review Board shall be 
treated “as having been established under 
the laws of the province.” Therefore, for 
the purposes of the Act, the CCRB is a 
provincial body. In addition, the 
Ontario Regulation 516/90 made under 
the Acthad been amended by section 1 
of Ontario Regulation 497/92 to in- 
clude the CCRB as a designated 


institution under the Act.

An individual asked the IPC to review a 
tule of the Interprovincial Lottery Cor- 
poration (ILC) which gave it the right to 


publish the names, addresses and/or pho- 


tographs of lottery winners. 


In addition, he complained about the 
Ontario Lottery Corporation (OLC) re- 
vising the format of the telecast of the 
Lotto 6/49 game. 


CONCLUSION 

The complainant was advised that 
as the ILC was not an institution 
under the Acts, it was not within the 
Commissioner’s jurisdiction. However, 
the IPC examined a similar “rule” of the 
OLC, a member of the ILC but an insti- 
tution under the provincial legislation. 


The IPC determined that the OLC had 
statutory authority under the regulations 
of the Ontario Lottery Corporation Actto 
collect information from holders of win- 
ning tickets including their names and 
addresses and to publish these names and 
addresses together with photographs. 


The IPC concluded that the collection of 
this information was in accordance with 
section 38(2) of the provincial Actwhich 
states that personal information may be 
collected if it is expressly authorized by 
statute. The IPC also concluded that the 
publication of this information fell within 
the circumstances outlined in sections 
42(c) and 42(e) of the Act. The disclosure 
of names, addresses and/or photographs 
was for a purpose for which the informa- 
tion was obtained and it also complied 
with the regulations of the Ontario Lot- 
tery Corporation Act. 


With respect to the complainant's con- 
cerns that the telecast of Lotto 6/49 had 
been changed, the IPC explained to him 
that this complaint did not fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Commissioner. It did 
not involve an access request for informa- 
tion in the custody or control of an 
institution nor did it involve personal 
information held by an institution.

A police association made an access re- 
quest under the Act to the Town, for a 
report on the Town’s police services. 
The Mayor, head of the Town, complied 
with the access request by providing a 
copy of the report to the police associa- 
tion. The report contained the personal 
information of an individual. This indi- 
vidual complained that his personal 
information had been disclosed to the 
police association and that he had not 
received any notice of the disclosure. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the Mayor had 
provided the police association with a 
copy of the report in question. The IPC 
concluded that this report contained the 
complainant’s personal information. 


The Town relied upon section 32(a) of 
the Act which states that personal infor- 
mation shall not be disclosed except in 
accordance with Part I of the Acz, dealing 
with access to records. The IPC found 
that in order to comply with section 
32(a) of the Act, the Mayor had to con- 
sider whether any of the mandatory ex- 
emptions in Part I applied to the report 
before releasing it. The Town stated that 
no personal information as defined by 
the Acthad been released. However, the 
IPC determined that the report had con- 
tained the complainant’s personal 
information. Since the Town did not 
recognize that the report contained any

personal information, the IPC concluded 
that the Mayor may not have considered 
the mandatory exemption in section 14 
of the Act, which deals with the disclosure 
of personal information. 


Since the Town did not comply with the 
provisions in Part I of the Act, the IPC 
concluded that the disclosure of the per- 
sonal information was notin compliance 
with section 32(a) of the Act. 


The Town also relied upon section 32(c) 
of the Act which states that personal 
information shall not be disclosed except 
for the purpose for which it was obtained 
or compiled or for a consistent purpose. 
The IPC found that the report was 
obtained for the purpose of improving 
police services. However, the IPC found 
that the report was disclosed to comply 
with an access request under Part I of the 
Act. The IPC concluded that this disclo- 
sure was not for the purpose of improy- 
ing police services and, therefore, the 
disclosure was not for the purpose for 
which the personal information was ob- 
tained or compiled, or for a consistent 
purpose. The IPC concluded that the 
disclosure was not in compliance with 
section 32(c) of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Town 
ensure compliance with the provisions of 
Part I of the Act, and that the Town 
ensure that all staff are aware of the 
limited purposes for which the disclosure 
of personal information is permitted 
under the Act.

The complainant was the mother of a 
minor child, who was a student of this 
Board of Education. At the request of 
the complainant, a hearing was held at 
the Ministry of Education, attended by 
representatives of the Board, including 
the Board’s solicitor, the complainant 
and her child. The child’s father (the 
complainant’s ex-husband) was invited 
to the hearing but did not attend. The 
removal ofa number of documents from 
the student’s Ontario Student Record 
(OSR) was discussed at the hearing. 
Copies of these documents were given 
to the solicitor. 


The complainant was concerned that an 
employee of the Board had disclosed the 
information discussed at the hearing to 
the father whom she believed was not 
entitled to it. The complainant was also 
of the view that: (1) the solicitor’s copies 
of the OSR records should have been 
shredded; (2) a separate file maintained 
by the solicitor, containing personal in- 
formation about her child, should have 
been listed as a data bank in the Board’s 
directory of records; and (3) the student’s 
OSR file should have indicated when the 


solicitor had accessed it. 


CONCLUSION 

We were unable to determine if the 
Board’s employee had disclosed the in- 
formation discussed at the hearing to the 


father. if the Board had 


However, 


~ disclosed personal information, it could 


have disclosed the information about the 
health, welfare and education of the child 
under sections 20(5) and (7) of the Chil- 
dren’s Law Reforms Act. Therefore, the 
Board would have acted in accordance 
with section 32(e) of the Act. 


The IPC also concluded that: (1) the 
information in the solicitor’s file was 
retained in accordancewith the retention 
provisions of section 5 of Ontario Regu- 
lation 517/90; (2) the solicitor’s file was 
a personal information bank; and (3) the 
student’s OSR file did not indicate use or 
disclosure by the solicitor, as required by 
section 35 of the Act. 


“ RECOMMENDATION 


The IPC recommended that the Board 
include the solicitor’s files in its next ° 
publication of its directory of records, as 
required by section 34. The IPC also 
recommended that any instances in- 
volving the use or disclosure of personal 
information from the OSR presently not

A memo with the form stated that “the 
survey is anonymous” and “any com- 
ments or questions you may wish to 


include would be most helpful”. Most

employees commented on their choice 
and some signed their forms. 


The employees’ comments were sum- 
marized in a document. Several employ- 
ees complained that they had given their 
comments in confidence. They believed 
that their privacy had been breached 
when a member of the Board read these 
comments verbatim at a public meeting 
attended by the media and when the 
Board provided other employees with 
copies of the summary. 


CONCLUSION 
The IPC determined that: 


¢The information on the survey form 
“ ° . » i . 
was “personal information” as defined in 
section 2(1) of the Act, since it was re- 
corded information about identifiable 


individuals. 


¢The Board did not give the employees 
notice that their personal information 
was being collected on the survey form as 
required by section 29(2) of the Act. 


¢The summary contained personal in- 
_ formation, since it contained recorded 
information about an identifiable indi- 


vidual. 


*The Board did not disclose personal 
information as defined in section 2(1) of 
the Act, to the media, since the indivi- 
duals who made the comments could 
not be identified from the specific com- 
ments that were disclosed. 


¢The Board disclosed personal informa- 
tion to other employees when it gave 
them a copy of the summary. This 
disclosure was not in accordance with 
section 32(d) since they did not need the 
personal information to do their jobs. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that: 


* When the Board collects personal in- 
formation, it provides individuals with 
proper notice of collection as required by 
section 29(2) of the Act. 


¢The Board restrict disclosure of records 
of personal information it collects to the 
officers and employees of the institution 
who need to know the personal informa- 
tion to perform their job duties, in ac- 


cordance with section 32(d) of the Act. 


The Board take steps to increase aware- 
ness of the kinds of information that are 
defined as personal information under 
the Act, and of its obligations regarding 
the collection, use, and disclosure of 
personal information. 


°To prevent inadvertent disclosure of

An individual claimed that a letter, with 
a number of attachments containing her 
personal information, was: (1) collected 
by the Board without proper notice; (2) 
disclosed by the Board to other individu- 
als without her consent; (3) misplaced by 


the Board. 


CONCLUSION 

Since the letter itself did not specifically 
identify any individual, itdid not contain 
personal information. However, the at- 
tachments to the letter did contain per- 
sonal information. The IPC found that 
when the personal information in the 
attachments was combined with the let- 
ter, the information in the letter then 
became the personal information of the 
complainant. Therefore, the IPC con- 
cluded that information in the letter 
when accompanied by the attachments, 
was personal information. 


The complainant stated that the Chair of 
the Board had received both the letter 
and the attachments because he had for- 
warded the information to another indi- 
vidual who had in turn forwarded it to 
the complainant. However, the Chair 
maintained that he had received the let- 
ter, but not the attachments. Therefore, 
since the IPC was unable to determine 
whether the letter with the attachments 
was collected by the Chair, it was unable 
to state categorically that the personal 
information had been collected by the 
Board. 


Since the IPC was unable to determine 
whether the personal information had 
been collected by the Board, we could 


not address the issue of disclosure. 


The IPC reviewed the minutes of the 
public meeting where, according to the 
complainant, a replacement copy of the 
letter with the attachments had been 
provided to the Board. The IPC found 
that a replacement copy of the letter and 
attachments had not been provided to 
the Board and the IPC, therefore, con- 
cluded that there was no evidence that 
the personal information had been mis- 


placed by the Board.

An employee of the Municipality filed a 
human rights complaint against the 
Municipality. In order to prepare its 
defence, the Municipality’s Legal De- 
partment requested the employee’s per- 
sonnel file from the Municipality's Com- 
munity Services Department, where he 
was employed. This Department dis- 
closed the employee’s entire personnel 
file to the Legal Department, which re- 
viewed it and used what personal infor- 
mation it deemed relevant, to prepare its 
defence. The employee was concerned 
that: (1) his entire personnel file was used 
by the Legal Department, and (2) that 
the Community Services Department 
had disclosed his entire personnel file to 


the Legal Department. 


CONCLUSION 

1. Section 31(b) of the Act states that an 
institution shall not use personal infor- 
mation except for the purpose for which 
it was obtained or compiled, or for a 
consistent purpose. The IPC determined 
that the employee’s personal informa- 
tion was obtained and compiled for em- 
ployment purposes, and that the use of 
the personal information by the Legal 
Department was for the purpose of 
preparing a defence to the employee’s 
human rights complaint, which was 
an employment-related matter. Ac- 
cordingly, the IPC concluded that 
this use of the personal information 
Was a consistent purpose. 


Further, the IPC concluded that the 
employee might reasonably have expected 
the Legal Department’s use of the per- 
sonal information, since the human rights 


44 


complaint was an employment-related 
matter and the employee had. under- 
stood the need for using some of this 
information. Therefore, the IPC con- 
cluded that the use of the personal infor- 
mation by the Legal Department was in 
compliance with section 31(b) of the Act. 


2. Section 32(d) of the Act states that an 
institution shall not disclose personal 
information except if the disclosure is 
made to an officer or employee of the 
institution who needs the record in the 
performance ofhis or her duties and ifthe 
disclosure is necessary and proper in the 
discharge of the institution’s functions. 


The IPC determined that the Legal De- 
partment “needed” the personal infor- 
mation in the performance ofits duties to 
prepare a defence to the employee’s hu- 
man rights complaint. The IPC also 
determined that since the Legal Depart- 
ment was acting on behalf of the Munici- 
pality in preparing a defence to the em- 
ployee’s complaint, the disclosure was 
necessary and proper in the discharge of 
the Municipality’s functions. The IPC 
concluded that the disclosure by the 
Community Services Department was 
in accordance with section 32(d) of the 


Act.

This complaint involved a mother and 
her daughter. The daughter, a contract 
employee of the Township, applied fora 


permanent position similar to her con- 


tract position. The Township gave the 
job toa man. The daughter made an 
inquiry to the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission (the HRC), believing that 
she might have been discriminated 
against on the basis of sex. Meanwhile, 
the mother attended several open coun- 
cil meetings, asking questions about 
the Township’s hiring practices. 


The daughter eventually decided not to 
pursue the HRC matter, after learning 
that the position had first been offered to 
a woman. At an open council meeting, 
the Township’s Administrator identified 
the daughter as the HRC complainant, 
saying that the HRC had found no 


grounds to proceed with her complaint. 


After the local press received a copy of the 
minutes of the meeting, a reporter inter- 
viewed the Township’s Deputy-Reeve 
about the HRC complaint. The Deputy- 
Reeve was under the impression that the 
mother had made the complaint to the 
HRC on behalf of her daughter. The 
article that was published said that the 
mother had made the complaint to the 
HRC, and that the HRC had found the 
allegations of sexual discrimination to be 
false. The article also said that the daugh- 
ter had been on a shortlist of candidates 
to be hired for the position in question, 
and commented on her working abilities 
and qualifications. 


The mother complained thather privacy 
was breached by the disclosure of ~ 
information about her to the press, and 
that the information disclosed was 
inaccurate. 


_ The daughter complained that her

CONCLUSION 
[92-28M - the mother’s complaint: 


The IPC found that the information 
disclosed to the press was not the 
mother’s “personal information” as defined 
in section 2(1) of the Act, because there 
was no recorded information to show 
that the HRC complainant was the 
mother. Therefore, the privacy provisions 
of the Act did not apply in the circum- 


stances of the mother’s complaint. 
192-29M - the daughter’s complaint: 


The IPC found that the information 
disclosed in the minutes and in the inter- 
view was the daughter’s personal infor- 
mation as defined in section 2(1) of the 
Act, because it was recorded information 


about an identifiable individual. 


The IPC also found that the disclosures 
had not been made in accordance with 
the provisions of section 32 of the Act, 
which outlines the circumstances which 
permit disclosure. 


The IPC advised the complainant and 
the institution of the provisions of sec- 
tion 36(2) of the Act, which provide for 


the correction of personal information. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that:

The complainant was an employee of the

Board felt, among other things, that dis-

including dismissal for just cause might 
be warranted. In order to make such a 


~ determination, the Board collected 


information about the complainant 
including investigators’ reports, video

complainant's employment was 
subsequently terminated. 


The complainant was of the view that 
the Board had improperly collected his 


personal information. 


During the course of the investigation, 
the complainant also indicated that he 
was concerned about the intended use of 
this information by the Board before 
grievance arbitration proceedings. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the collection

therefore did not fall within the jurisdic- 


tion of the Commissioner. 


The IPC determined that the intended 
use of the information was in accordance

KEYWORDS 
collect ¢ SIN ¢ notice 


The complainant (a senior citizen) had 
completed a municipal application form — 
for free snow removal from city sidewalks. 
This form asked applicants to provide 
certain personal information, including 
their old age security pension number. 
This consists of a three-number prefix 
plus the social insurance number (the 
SIN). The complainant stated that her 
husband had provided his birth certifi- — 


cate as proof of being a senior citizen,

and that the municipality had accepted 
this. As a result, the complainant was 
questioning why the municipality was 
collecting the SIN, when it was not 
necessary. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that it was not nec- 
essary for the municipality to collect the 
SIN from senior citizens for the purpose 
of requesting free snow removal. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the munici- 
pality no longer collect the SIN and that 
it provide notice on the form, pursuant to 
section 28(2) of the Act. 


The municipality agreed that it did not 
need to collect the SIN from senior citi- 
zens and would revise its application 
form accordingly. The municipality also 
agreed that it would provide notice on its 
application form.

retention of personal information 


The complainant had sent his unsolic- 
ited resume to the transit commission 
(the Commission). The Commission 
acknowledged his resume and told him 
that they would keep it on file for four 
months. The complainant subsequently 
filed an access request with the Com- 
mission for his personal information. The 
Commission informed him that they 
had no such records. The complainant 
asserted that they should have kept his 


resume for the four months already men- 


tioned, plus one year. He complained 
that the Commission had not complied 
with the retention provisions of the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The Commission advised the IPC that it 
had in fact acknowledged the complain- 
ant’s resume and had destroyed it after 
four months. However, the IPC found 
that the Commission should have kept 
the resume for one year after receipt. As 
a result, the IPC concluded that the 
Commission had not complied with the 
retention provisions of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the 
Commission comply with the retention 
provisions for personal information 
contained in the Act. 


The Commission agreed to comply with - 


this recommendation.

tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels of 
the two deceased persons. This 
information had been severed from a 
one page document entitled “Report of 
the Centre of Forensic Sciences”. The 
Ministry claimed section 21 as the basis 
for exempting this information. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision not to disclose 
the information was upheld. 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


Because the information consists of re- 
corded information about identifiable 
individuals, it qualifies as “personal 
information” as defined in Section 2(1) 
of the Act. Section 2(2), which states that 
personal information does not include 
information about an individual who 
has been dead for more than 30 years, 
did not apply as the deaths occurred 
within the past 30 years. 


Section 21 


Once it has been determined that a 
record contains personal information, 
section 21 of the Act prohibits disclo- 
sure of this information except in certain 
circumstances. One such circumstance 
is contained in section 21(1)(f) of the 
Act which states that a head shall refuse 
to disclose personal information to any 
person other than the individual towhom 
the information relates except ifa disclo- 
sure does not constitute an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy. Because 
the post mortem forensic test results of 
blood alcohol and THC concentration 
related to the medical condition of the 
two deceased persons at the time of their 
death, the Inquiry Officer found that 
disclosure of the information would re- 
sult in a presumed unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy (section 21(3)(a)). 


Section 21(2) provides some criteria for 
the Ministry to consider in determining 
whether disclosure of personal 


information constitutes an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy. A combi- 
nation of the factors listed in section 


21(2) and/or any additional unlisted 


factors weighing in favour of disclosure 
might be so compelling as to outweigh a 
presumption under section 21(3), how- 
ever, such a case would be extremely 
unusual. 


Although the requester/appellant in this 
appeal is involved in a civil proceeding 
and the personal information he is seek- 
ing may have some bearing on the deter- 
mination of those proceedings, the In- 
quiry Officer was not satisfied that the 
personal information was relevant to a 
fair determination of rights affecting the 
person who made the request (section 


21(2)(d)).

(INQUIRY OFFICER SEIFE) 


KEYWORDS 
personal information * criminal history 
* correctional record * Ministry of 


Correctional Services Act * law enforcement 


* confiscated record * peace officer 


The Ministry received a request for access 
to the requester’s personal and medical 
files from four correctional centres. The 
record responsive to the request con- 
sisted of 683 pages, and the requester was 
granted access toa large number of pages. 
The Ministry had denied access to the 
remaining pages pursuant to sections 
14(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (€) and (h) and 
sections 49(b) and (e) of the Act. Gen- 


erally, the record relates to requester’s 


application for a temporary leave of ab- 


sence from the correctional centre in 


which he was an inmate. 


The requester appealed the Ministry’s 
decision to deny access to only certain 


pages of the record. 


ORDER 

The Inquiry Officer upheld the Minis- 
try’s decision not to disclose the record. 
In disposing of the appeal, the Inquiry 
Officer dealt only with sections 49(e) 
and 14(1)(h) of the Act. 


Section 2(1) - Personal Information 


All of the information in the record met 
the definition of personal information 
found in section 2(1) of the Act and 
related solely to the requester/appellant. 


Section 49(e) 
Section 49(e) of the Actallows the Min- 


istry to deny a requester access to his/her 
personal information in situations where 
the information is a correctional record 
and release of the information could 
reasonably be expected to reveal 
information that was supplied in confi- 
dence. 


A review of the record indicates that the 
information withheld from the appellant 
consists of information received from a 
third party by employees of the Correc- 
tional Centre processing the requester/ 
appellant’s application for a temporary 
leave of absence. After reviewing the 
representations of the Ministry, the In- 
quiry Officer was satisfied that the record 
was a correctional record and that the 
disclosure of the personal information 
would reveal information supplied to the 
Ministry in confidence. Therefore cer- 
tain parts of the record qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 49(e). 


Section 14(1)(h) 


The Ministry also claimed that disclo- 
sure of one page of the record could 
reasonably be expected to reveal a record 
which had been confiscated from a per- 
son by a peace officer in accordance with 
an act or regulation (section 14(1)(h)). 
In the Inquiry Officer’s view, section 
14(1)(h) allows the Ministry to deny a 
requester access to a record where either 
the record itself is a record which has been 
confiscated or where the disclosure of the 
record could reasonably be expected to 
reveal the content ofanother record which 
has been confiscated from a person by a 
peace officer, in accordance with an Act 


or Regulation. 


In its representations, the Ministry ar- 
gued that the superintendent of the cor- 
rectional centre is a peace officer under 
section 11(1)(a) of the Ministry of Correc- 
tional Services Act. The Ministry further 
argued that the record was confiscated 
under the authority of sections 22(1) and 
25(1) of Regulation 649, under the Min- 
istry of Correctional Services Act. After 
considering the Ministry’s representa- 
tions, the provisions of the Ministry of 
Correctional Services Act and Regulation 
649 under that Act, the Inquiry Officer . 
was satisfied that the Ministry had pro- 
vided sufficient evidence to establish that 
the one page met all the requirements to 
qualify for exemption under section 
14(1)(h) of the Act. Both section 49(e) 
and section 14(1)(h) are discretionary 
exemptions. After reviewing the Minis- 
try’s representations regarding its exer- 
cise of discretion, the Inquiry Officer 
found nothing to indicate that it was 
improper.

The College received a request for access 
to copies of the booklet of final examina- 
tion questions used in a course taken by 
the requester at the College. The College 
denied access to the booklet pursuant to 
Section 18(1)(h) of the Act Section 
18(1)(h) states that a head may refuse to 
disclose a record that contains questions 
that are to be used in an examination or 
test for an educational purpose. 


The College provided the requester with 
the correct answers to the questions, the 
marking scheme for the examination and 
a written rationale from the course in- 
structor. The College also confirmed 
that it was prepared to allow the requester 
to view the questions and to make notes. 


ORDER 


The College was ordered to release the 
booklet. 


In its representations, the College argued 
that Section 18(1)(h) should apply both 
to questions which have not yet been 
used in an examination and questions 
which are maintained in a “test bank”. 
The Assistant Commissioner found that 
the record at issue consists of questions 
already used in examinations. The fact 
that the College may at some point in the 
future choose to re-use the same ques- 
tions is not sufficient to satisfy the re- 
quirements of section 18(1)(h). Because 
the College is prepared to allow students 
to view the examination questions and 
make notes, the refusal to disclose a copy 


of the examination questions is incon- 
sistent with a legitimate concern for the 
integrity of the “test bank” of questions.

KEYWORDS 
law enforcement ® personal privacy 
° refusal to confirm or deny existence of 


record 


The Ministry received a request for access 
to any information pertaining to the 
requester in the possession of the Minis- 
try’s Emergency Health Branch. The 
requester is a former employee of the 
Ministry who was discharged in July, 
1991. The Ministry responded by refus- 
ing to confirm or deny the existence of a 
responsive record pursuant to section 
14(3) and section 21(5) of the Act. Sec- 
tion 14(3) states thata head may refuse to 
confirm or deny the existence of a record 
to which subsection 14(1) or 14(2) ap- 


ply. Section 21(5) states that a head may | 


refuse to confirm or deny the existence of 
a record if disclosure of the record would 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy. 


ORDER 

The Assistant Commissioner disclosed 
the existence of the records responsive to 
the request. The order was released to the 
Ministry before it was released to the 
requester/appellant in order to provide 
the Ministry with an opportunity to 
review the order and determine whether 
to apply for judicial review. The Assist- 


ant Commissioner also ordered the Min- 


* 


istry to make a substantive decision un- 
der the access provisions of the Act. 


By invoking sections 14(3) and/or 21(5), 
the Ministry is denying the requester/ 
appellant the right to know whether a 
record exists, even when one does not. 
These sections provide the Ministry with 
a significant discretionary power which 
should be exercised only in rare cases. 


Section 14(3) 


In order to successfully argue the applica- 
tion of section 14(3) to a record, the 


‘Ministry must do more than merely in- 


dicate that records of the nature requested, 
if they exist, would qualify for exemption 
under sections 14(1) or (2). An institu- 
tion must provide detailed and convinc- 
ing evidence that disclosure of the mere 
existence of the requested records would 
convey information to the requester which 
could compromise the effectiveness of a 
law enforcement activity. 


The Ministry argued that disclosure of 
the fact that an investigation of one na- 
ture is underway does not mitigate or 
lessen the requirement of the Head to 
refuse to confirm or deny an investiga- 
tion of another nature is underway when 
circumstances necessitate such an action. 
In the Assistant Commissioner's view, by 
making such an argument, the Ministry 
confused the exercise of discretion under 
section 14(3) with the analysis of the 
exemption claimed under sections 14(1) 
and (2). Section 14(3) does not require 
the Ministry to confirm the “nature” of 
the investigation. It merely gives the 
Ministry the discretion to refuse to con- 
firm or deny the existence of a record 
to which section 14(1) or (2) applies. 
The Ministry failed to establish that 
disclosure of the mere existence of the 
requested records would convey infor- 
mation to the requester which would 
compromise the effectiveness of any law 
enforcement activity.

COMMISSIONER/

Section 21(5) 


Similarly, an institution relying on sec- 
tion 21(5) must do more than merely 
indicate that the disclosure of the records 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy. The Ministry must 
provide detailed and convincing evidence 
that disclosure of the mere existence of 
the requested records would convey 
information to the requester and that the 
disclosure of this information would con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy. By simply confirming that records 
associated with an investigation exists, 
without indicating the nature of these 
records, the type of investigation or the 
parties involved, the Ministry would not 


be compromising the privacy interest of 


any individual. 


The Assistant Commissioner also com- 
mented on the fact that the Ministry, 
itself, has confirmed that a Ministry em- 
ployee met with the requester/appellant 
being investigated and disclosed that there 
was an investigation underway. It is 
reasonable to assume that if an investiga- 
tion is being conducted, some records 
would have been produced. Therefore, it 
is not open to the Ministry to raise sec- 
tions 14(3) or 21(5) in these circum- 
stances. Because the interest of certain 
other individuals may be affected by 
disclosure of the records, the Assistant 
Commissioner decided to send the mat- 


ter back to the Ministry to issue a sub- 


stantive decision under the access provi- 
sions of the Act.

KEYWORDS 


cabinet records ¢ solicitor client privilege 


The Ministry receiveda request for access 
to all records pertaining to the Ministry 


fact sheet “Residency Requirements for 
Regular and Extended Absences”. The 


‘Ministry identified 1 1 responsive records 


and released all but two of them to the 
requester. [The records at issue are a draft 
report entitled “Health Care Benefits: 
Residents, Travellers and Temporary 
Residents” and a 5-page memorandum 
concerning whether the Ministry will 
pay the out-of-country expenses of a 
specific individual. The Ministry claimed 
that disclosure of the draft report would 
reveal the substance of deliberations of 
the executive council or its committees or 
a record containing policy options or 
recommendations submitted or prepared 
for submission to executive council or its 
committees (section 12(1) and section 
12(1)(b)). The Ministry claimed that 
solicitor-client privilege (section 19) ap- 
plies to the 5 page memorandum. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision to withhold 
disclosure of the records was partially 


upheld. 


Section 12(1)(b) 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 12(1)(b), the record must con- 
tain policy options or recommendations 
and must have been submitted or pre- 
pared for submission to the executive 
council or its committees. Although the 
draft report meets the first criterion as it 
contains policy options and recommen- 
dations, the Ministry itself states that the 
first record did not go before cabinet in 


its current form nor is it intended to go 
before cabinet at a future date. There- 
fore, section 12(1)(b) does not apply. 


Section 12(1) 


Any record where disclosure would re- 
veal the substance of deliberations of an 
executive council or its committees quali- 
fies for exemption under section 12(1). 
The draft report contains three parts. 
Because the contents of part III would 
reveal substance of a cabinet submission 
made in April, 1991, part III of record 1 
qualifies for exemption under section 


IPAGEE 


Parts I and II of the draft report were 
incorporated into a “voluminous” dis- 
cussion paper. The contents of the dis- 
cussion paper are currently being re- 
worked intoa policy options paper which 
is tentatively scheduled for the Deputy 
Minister's committee. In the Commis- 
sioner's view, the relationship between 
the contents of parts Land II of the record 
and a possible future cabinet submission 
are remote. Therefore, parts I and II of 
the record do not qualify for exemption 
under section 12(1). This also applies to 
those portions of parts I and II which 
appear in the executive summary of the 
report. 


Section 19 


Section 19 applies to record 2 because it 
meets all four parts of the test for com- 
mon-law solicitor-client privilege. It isa 
written communication. Its contents 
raised an expectation that itwill be treated 
in confidence; it is a communication 
from a lawyer to an agent of the director 
of the Ministry’s Communications and 
Information Branch and it is directly 


related to giving legal advice.

The Ministry received three separate 
requests for access to the files of three job 
competitions conducted by the Minis- 
try. The requester was a candidate in all 
three competitions. The Ministry pro- 
vided copies of the questions and the 
requester’s answers and ratings. The 
Ministry denied access to the “correct 
answers” because: 1) this would disclose 
a record that contains plans relating to 
the management of personnel or the 
administration ofan institution that have 
not yet been put into operation or made 
public (section 18(1)(f)) or 2) this would 
disclose a record that contains proposed 
plans, policies or projects of an institu- 
tion where the disclosure could reason- 
ably be expected to result in premature 
disclosure ofa pending policy decision or 
result in undue financial benefit or loss to 
a person (section 18(1)(g)). 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 
records containing the correct answers. 


Section 18(1)(f) 


Section 18(1)(f) is designed to protect 
records of a certain nature, namely 
“plans”, that have not yet been put into 
operation or that have notyet been made 
public irrespective of the consequences 
of their disclosure. The Inquiry Officer 
found that even if he were prepared to 
accept that the records contain “plans” he 
was not satisfied that the “plans” have not 
yet been put into operation or made 
public. Therefore the correct answers do 
not qualify for exemption under section 


18(1)(f).* 


Section 18(1)(g) 


The Inquiry Officer also found that even 
if he were prepared to accept that the 
correct answers are part of the Ministry's 
hiring “plan” or “policy” and that their 
disclosure could result in premature dis- 
closure of a pending policy decision or 
undue financial and further loss to a 
person, he could not find that the exemp- 
tion under section 18(1)(g) is satisfied 
since the correct answers are not part ofa 
proposed plan or policy.*

The College received a request for access 
to the specifics of all allegations of im- 
proper conduct made against the re- 
quester, to the College by a named in- 
dividual. The College determined that 
two records were responsive to the re- 
quest, an internal college memorandum 
and a letter written by the named indivi- 
dual. The College transferred the part of 
the request concerning the letter to the 
Palmerston Police Service on the basis 
that it hada greater interest in the record. 
The College denied access to the memo- 
randum pursuant to sections 49(a) and 
(b) of the Act. Section 49(a) states that 
the College may refuse to disclose per- 
sonal information to the individual to 
whom the information relates where a 
number of sections, including section 
13, would apply to the disclosure of that 
personal information. Section 49(b) states 
that the College may refuse to disclose 
personal information to the individual to 
whom the information relates where dis- 
closure would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of another individual’s personal 
privacy. Sections 21(3) and 21(2) pro- 
vide some guidance in determining 
whether disclosure would result in an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


ORDER 
Decision of the College not to disclose 
the record was partially upheld. 


Section 49(b) 


The record contains personal information 
that relates to both the requester and the 
individual who made the complaint to 
the College. The College has claimed 
that disclosure of the personal information 
of the complainant is presumed to con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy because it consists of personal 
recommendations or evaluations, char- 
acter references or personnel evaluations 
(section 21(3)(g)). The Inquiry Officer 
found that any comments in the record 
which might be seen as “evaluations” 
would pertain only to the requester and 
not the complainant. Therefore, section 
21(3)(g) is not relevant. The Inquiry 
Officer also reviewed the other presump- 
tions listed in section 21(3) and in his 
view, none applied in the circumstances 
of the appeal. He also reviewed factors 
listed under section 21(2) and found 
that none of the factors which weigh in 
favour of privacy protection (sections 
21(2)(e)-G) are relevant. The Inquiry 
Officer was not satisfied that disclosure 
of the record would be an unjustified 
invasion of the personal privacy of the 
complainant. 


The Inquiry Officer commented that 
where the personal information relates to 
the requester, the onus should not be on 
the requester to prove that disclosure of 
the personal information would notcon- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of the per- 
sonal privacy of another. individual. 
Since the requester has a right of access to 
his/her own personal information, the 
only situation under section 49(b) in 
which he/she can be denied access to the 
information is if it can be demonstrated 
that the disclosure of the information 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of another individual’s privacy. 


Section 49(a) 


Section 49(a) is a discretionary exemp- 
tion which allows the College to deny the 
requester access to information that re- 
lates to him/her if the information quali- 
fies for exemption under certain sections, 
one of which is section 13. 


Ithas been established in several previous 
orders that advice for the purposes of 
section 13(1) must contain more than 


mere information. Generally speaking, 


“advice” pertains to the submission of a 
suggested course of action, which will 
ultimately be accepted or rejected by its 
recipient in the deliberative process. 
“Recommendations” are to be viewed in 
the same vein. In the opinion of the 
Inquiry Officer, only one sentence of the 
record qualifies for exemption under sec- 
tion 13(1). This sentence describes a 
course of action suggested by the author 
of the record, to her immediate supervi- 
sor, who was ina position to either accept 
or reject the recommendations. The part 
of the record containing the recommen- 
dations can reasonably be severed with- 
out disclosing information that falls un- 
der the section 13(1) exemption. 


Section 13(2) providesa number of man- 
datory exceptions to the section 13(1) 
exemption, one of which states that a 
head shall not refuse to disclose a record 
that contains reasons for a final decision. 
The appellant submits that the record 
must contain the reasons for the decision 
to dismiss him. The Inquiry Officer 
reviewed the sentence and the represen- 
tations of the parties and found that the 
record does not contain the reasons for a 
final decision with respect to the allega- 
tions made against the requester. There- 
fore, section 13(2)(1) is not applicable in 
the circumstances of the appeal and, 
therefore, one sentence of the record is 
exempt from disclosure pursuant to sec- 


tion 49(a).

The Ministry received a request for a 
copy of the recommendations of an in- 
dividual who was acting as the Deputy 
Minister’s designee at stage two of a 
grievance. The Ministry identified the 
responsive record as a one page covering 
memorandum, a 12-page report and a 
one page appendix. The Ministry pro- 
vided access to parts of the record and 
denied access to other portions pursuant 
to sections 13(1), 17(1)(d), 19, 18(1)(¢) 
and 21(1) of the Acz. 


ORDER 

The decision of the Ministry was par- 
tially upheld. In dealing with the issues 
raised by the appeal the Assistant 
Commissioner dealt solely with the ap- 


PAY, 


As a preliminary matter, the Assistant 
Commissioner dealt with two issues; the

COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Section 17(1)(d) 


In its original decision letter, the institu- 
tion raised section 17(1)(d) of the Actas 
one of the bases for exempting the re- 
maining parts of the record. As the 
written representation submitted by the 
Ministry made no reference to this ex- 
emption, the Assistant Commissioner 
concluded that the claim had been aban- 
doned by the Ministry. However, he 
went on to comment that, in any event, 
in order to qualify for exemption under 
section 17(1) of the Act, the information 
contained in a record must have been 
supplied to an institution, by a third 
party. A third party, by definition, is not 
part of the institution. The record at 
issue in the appeal was created by an 
employee of the Ministry and, in the 
Assistant Commissioner’s view, could 
not qualify for consideration as third 
party information under section 17(1). 


Privilege 

The second preliminary issue relates to 
the Ministry’s claim that the record is a 
privileged document at both common 
law and under existing labour relations 


jurisprudence. Section 67(2) of the Act 


. lists the confidentiality provisions which 


prevail over the Act. Included in this list 
are certain provisions of the Labour Rela- 
tions Act, the Colleges Collective Bargain- 
ing Act, and the Crown Employees Collec- 
tive Bargaining Act which deal with the 


- disclosure of information relating to 


membership in a trade union or other 
employee organization. None of the 
confidentiality provisions listed in sec- 


tion 67(2) deal with the type of record 


‘ which is at issue in this appeal. The 


Ministry did not identify a confidential- 
ity provision in any other statute that 
specifically overrides the provisions of 
the Act and covers the type of record 
which is at issue in this appeal. There- 
fore, the Assistant Commissioner found 
that the records must be considered un- 
der the appropriate provisions of the Act. 


The Assistant Commissioner went on to 
say that whether a record such as the 
one at issue in this appeal might be 
recognized as “privileged” in labour rela- 
tions jurisprudence is not relevant to a 
request for access under the Act where 
that “privilege” is not codified in one of 
the exceptions to the right of access under 
sections 12 through 22 of the Act. Solici- 
tor client privilege is codified in section 
19 of the Act and was dealt with by the 
Assistant Commissioner in making his 
determination. 


Section 18(1)(c) 


To establish a valid exemption claim 
under section 18(1)(c), the Ministry must 
demonstrate a reasonable expectation of 
prejudice to the economic interest or 
competitive position of a government 
institution arising from disclosure of the 
information. It is not necessary to prove 
that the actual harm enumerated in this 
section will result from disclosure, only 
that the expectation of harm is based on 
reason and is not fanciful, imaginary or 
contrived. The onus rests with the insti- 
tution to demonstrate that the harms 
envisioned by this section are present or 
reasonably foreseeable. The evidence 
submitted by the Ministry must be de- 
tailed and convincing. 


Section 18(1)(c) does not contemplate 
prejudice to any so-called “economic 
interest” ofa ministry in its relations with 
its employees; rather, it provides institu- 
tions with a discretionary exemption 
which can be claimed for certain records 
if, disclosure could reasonably be ex- 
pected to prejudice an institution in the 
competitive market place, interfere with 
its ability to discharge its responsibility in 
managing the provincial economy or 
adversely affect the government’s ability 
to protect its legitimate economic inter- 
est. Because the representations of the 
Ministry focused on its relations with its 
employees, the Ministry has failed to 


establish that the record qualifies for 


exemption under section 18(1)(c). 


Section 19 


The Ministry submitted that the record 
qualifies for exemption under branch 2 
of the section 19 exemption. Two crite- 
ria must be satisfied in order for a record 
to qualify for exemption under branch 2: 
First, the record must have been pre- 
pared by or for Crown counsel; and 
second, the record must have been pre- 
pared for use in giving legal advice, or in 
contemplation of litigation, or for use in 
litigation. 


It is clear that the record at issue was not 
prepared by Crown counsel. 
created by the manager of the Ministry’s 


It was 


Water Policy section who is nota lawyer. 
It is also evident from the face of the 
record that it was not prepared for Crown 
counsel. It was created for presentation 
to senior management within a particu- 
lar division of the Ministry. Although in 
some instances, stage two grievance re- 
ports are eventually considered by Crown 
counsel in conducting litigation, in the 
circumstances of this appeal, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner could not accept that 
either theauthor or recipient of the record 
is crown counsel as required by the test. 
Therefore, the record fails to qualify for 


exemption under section 19. 


Section 13 


Section 13(1) of the Actstates that a head 
may refuse to disclose a record where the 
disclosure would reveal advice or recom- 
mendations of a public servant. It has 
been established in a number of previous 
orders that “advice for the purposes of 
section 13(1) must contain more than 
mere information. Generally speaking, 
“advice” pertains to the submission of a 
suggested course of action, which will 
ultimately be accepted or rejected by its 
recipient in the deliberative process.

the same vein. In this appeal, the record 
was prepared for the executive director of 
the Ministry’s Lands and Water section. 
Portions of the record clearly describe a 
recommended method of resolving the 
grievance and addressing the concerns 
raised by several employees about the 
operation of a certain section. These 
portions qualify for exemption under 
section 13(1). 
covering memorandum contains an 
opinion of the author of the report but 
not “advice or recommendations” and 
this paragraph does not qualify under 
section 13(1). The Assistant Commis- 
sioner reviewed the list of mandatory 
exceptions to the exemption contained 
in section 13(2) of the Actand found that 
none of them apply in the circumstances 


of this appeal. - 


It has also been established in a number 
of previous orders that information pro- 
vided by an individual in a professional 
capacity or in the execution of employ- 
ment responsibilities is not personal 
information. Therefore, the views and 
opinions of the author of the report do 
not qualify as the personal information of 
this individual. However, information 
provided by certain other employees to 
the author of the report about another 
individual do qualify as that individual’s 
personal information. No parts of the 
record contain the personal information 
of the appellant/requester. 


Once it has been determined thata record 
contains personal information, section 
21(1) of the Act prohibits disclosure of 
this information, except in certain cir- 
cumstances, to anyone other than the 
individual to whom the information re- 
lates. One such circumstance is if the 
disclosure does not constitute an unjusti- 
fied invasion of personal privacy (section 
21(1)(f)). In the circumstances of this 
appeal, the appellant provided no evi- 
dence in support of the relevance of any

One paragraph of the 


factors in section 21(2)(a)-(d) which 
would weigh in favour of finding that 
disclosure of the personal information 
would not result in an unjustified inva- 
sion of their personal privacy. Therefore, 
section 21(1) of the Act applies to the 


personal information.

The Ministry received request for access 
to records relating to an investigation of 
an allegation of sexual harassment. Spe- 
cifically, the request was for the questions 
asked and responses provided by all per- 
sons interviewed which were used to 
determine the result of the investigation. 
The requester is the individual who was 
accused of sexual harassment. The Min- 
istry identified a number of typewritten

summaries and handwritten notes of in- 
terviews with several individuals as re- 
sponsive to the request. Prior to making 
its decision, the Ministry notified the 
individuals who were interviewed of the 
request. Five persons consented to dis- 
closure of the information relating to 
them. The Ministry provided access to 
the notes of the requester’s own interview 
and partial access to notes of interviews 
with other individuals. Access to the 
remaining information was denied pur- 
suant to section 49(b) of the Act. The 
requester appealed the Ministry’s deci- 
sion to deny access to parts of the record 


and stated that he believed additional 


records existed. 


Notice that an inquiry was being con- 
ducted to review the Ministry’s decision 
was sent to the requester/appellant, the 
Ministry, the person who alleged that the 
sexual harassment had occurred (the com- 
plainant) and seven of the eight persons 
who had been interviewed during the 
course of the investigation (the inter- 
viewees). One of the interviewees had 
died since the interviews were conducted. 


ORDER 

The Inquiry Officer found that the search 
conducted by the Ministry was reason- 
able in the circumstances of the appeal. 
The decision of the Ministry not to 
disclose portions of the records to the 
appellant was partially upheld. 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


The Inquiry Officer first determined 
whether the records at issue contained 
personal information. In her view, all 
of the records consist of recorded 
information about the appellant. In 
addition, parts of each record consists of 
recorded information about the com- 
plainant and parts of some of the records 
consist of recorded information about 
other identifiable individuals, including 


the interviewees. With respect to the one 


interviewee who had died since the inter- 
views were conducted, the Inquiry Of 
ficer concluded that section 2(2) of the 
Act did not apply because the death of 
the interviewee had occurred within the 
past 30 years. 


Section 49(b) 


Section 49(b) states that a head may 
refuse to disclose, to the individual to 
whom the information relates, personal 
information, where the disclosure would 
constitute an unjustified invasion of an- 
other individual’s personal privacy. Ifthe 
head determines that the release of the 
information would constitute such an 
unjustified invasion, then section 49(b) 
gives the head the discretion to deny the 
requester access to his/her own personal 
information. In this case, the Ministry 
received the consent of six of the inter- 
viewees to disclose their personal 
information to the requester/appellant. 
In addition, one of the interviewees indi- 
cated in his representations to the In- 
quiry Officer that he consents to the 
disclosure of his personal information to 
the requester/appellant. In the view of 
the Inquiry Officer, disclosure of the 
personal information of these 7 indivi- 
duals would not constitute an unjustified 
invasion of their privacy and section 


49(b) does not apply. 


Remaining at issue are the parts of the 
typewritten summaries and notes of in- 
terviews where no consent has been ob- 
tained for its disclosure. 


Sections 21(2) and 21(3) provide some 
guidance in determining whether disclo- 
sure would result in an unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy. The Ministry 
argues that the disclosure of the personal 
information is presumed to constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy 
because the personal information con- 
sists of personal recommendations or 
evaluations, character references or per- 


sonnel evaluations (section 21(3)(g)). In 
the opinion of the Inquiry Officer, the 
terms “personal evaluations” or “person- 
nel evaluations” refer to assessments made 
according to measurable standards. The 
records at issue contain opinions, com- 
ments and observations provided by the 
complainant and the interviewees dur- 
ing the course of the investigation. They 
do not consist of “personal” or “person- 
nel” evaluations. Therefore, the pre- 
sumption of an unjustified invasion of 
personal privacy contained in section 


21(3)(g) does not apply. 


The Ministry and the complainant 
claimed that sections 21(2)(f), (h), (g), 
(e) are relevant. The appellant contends 


that section 21(2)(d) is relevant. These 
sections state: 


A head, in determining whether a disclo- 
sure of personal information constitutes 
an unjustified invasion of personal pri- 
vacy, shall consider all the relevant cir- 
cumstances, including whether, 


(d) the personal information is relevant 
toa fair determination of rights affecting 
the person who made the request; 


(e) the individual to whom the 
information relates will be exposed un- 
fairly to pecuniary or other harm; 


(f) the personal information is highly 


sensitive; 


(g) the personal information is unlikely 
to be accurate or reliable; 


(h) the personal information has been 
supplied by the individual to whom the 


information relates in confidence. 


Section 21(2)(f) 
In the opinion of the Inquiry Officer, 


information pertaining to normal every- 
day working relationships and workplace 


11

conduct is not highly sensitive (section 
21(2)(f)). However, when an allegation 
of harassment is made and investigated, 
it is reasonable for the parties involved to 
restrict discussion of workplace relation- 
ships and conduct and to find such 
information distressing in nature. Nev- 
ertheless, it is not possible for such an 
investigation to proceed if the complaint 
is not made known to the respondents 
and the direct response to the allegations 
made in thecomplaintis not made known 
to the complainant. Section 21(2)(f) 1s 
relevant in the circumstances of this ap- 
peal, butonly to the personal information 
of persons other than theappellantwhich 
does not directly address the substance of 
the complaint and to which the indivi- 
dual has not consented to disclosure. 


Section 21(2)(g) 
Although the Ministry stated that com- 


ments made by the interviewees may not 
be accurate or reliable (section 21(2)(g)), 
the Inquiry Officer had no evidence be- 
fore her to suggest that the Ministry was 
able to discount or did not rely on this 
information. Therefore, section 2 1(2)(g) 
is not a relevant consideration in the 


appeal. 


Section 21(2)(h) 
The Ministry argued that given the sen- 


sitive nature of the issues involved, com- 
ments made by the interviewees were 
implicitly given in confidence (section 
21(2)(h)). In the Inquiry Officer’s view, it is 
neither practical nor possible to guaran- 
teecomplete confidentiality to every party 
during an internal investigation ofallega- 
tions of this nature. If the parties to a 
complaint are to have any confidence in 
the process, respondents in such a com- 
plaint must be advised of what and by 
whom they are accused in order that they 
may address the validity of the complain- 
ant 's allegations. In the Inquiry Officer’s 
opinion, section 21(2)(h) of the Act is a 
relevant consideration only with regard 


12 


to the personal information of persons 
other than the requester/appellant who 
have not consented to disclosure, and 
then, only to information which does not 
directlyaddress the substance of thesexual 


harassment complaint. 


Section 21(2)(e) 


The complainant claims that section 
21(2)(e) of the Actapplies to exempt the 
records from disclosure because of a fear 
of retaliation. The Inquiry Officer found 
that the complainant had not provided 


~ sufficient evidence to establish a direct 


connection between disclosure of the 
record and the harm described in section 
21(2)(e). Therefore, section 21(2)(e) is 
not a relevant consideration. 


Section 21(2)(d) 


The appellant submits that section 
21(2)(d), fair determination of rights, is 
relevant because the investigation culmi- 
nated in proceedings under the Public 
Services Act and resulted in disciplinary 
action against him. Section 21(2)(d) isa 
relevant consideration, as the appellant 
established each part ofa four part test for 
the application of this section, set out in 


Order P-312. 


In discussing the relevance of section 
21(2)(d), the Inquiry Officercommented 
that the fact that an alternate means of 
disclosure is available at a certain stage in 
another type of proceeding, does not rule 
out potential disclosure under the Free- 
dom of Information and Protection of Pri- 
vacy Act. . 


In summary, the Inquiry Officer found 
that sections 21(2)(d), (f) and (h) are 
relevant considerations in the circum- 
stances of this appeal. However, sections 
21(2)(f) and (h) are relevant only with 
regard to information provided by in- 
dividuals other than the appellant who 


have not consented to disclosure where it 


does notdirectly concern allegations made 
by the complainant. 


The Inquiry Officer found that disclo- 
sure of the personal information about 
the complainant which was provided by 
the interviewees would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of the complainant’s 
personal privacy and, therefore, section 
49(b) applies. In addition, she found 
that disclosure of the personal information 
of individuals other than the appellant 
which is not directly concerned with the 
allegations being investigated would also 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy and section 49(b) applies. 


The Inquiry Officer acknowledged that 
disclosure of the personal information of 
thecomplainant person and certain other 
individuals may invade their personal 
privacy to a degree. However, in balanc- 
ing the interest of the appellant in disclo- 
sure and the interest of the primary and 
the secondary affected persons in the 
protection of their privacy, she found 


that, in these circumstances, disclosureof 


the personal information would not con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of their 
personal privacy. 


The Inquiry Officer commented. that 
investigations into allegations of sexual 
harassment must be carried out with 


meticulous fairness to all involved, the © 


complainant, the person complained 
against and any witnesses who may be 


interviewed. An improper finding of — 
sexual harassment can have a significant 


consequence for the person againstwhom 
the finding is made. It may impair the 
ability of that person to advance in his/ 
her employment, or in fact prevent him/ 
her from obtaining employment.

personal information * right of correction 


The Ministry received a request for cor- 
rection of personal information relating 
to the requester. The Ministry wrote to 
the requester seeking clarification of the 
request in order to determine which 
~ records and which statements within the 

records were to be corrected and the 
“nature of the corrections sought by the 
appellant. The appellant identified the 


records as a two page excerpt from a 


Special Investigation Report dated April 


1990 which had been prepared by a 
“senior enforcement investigator for the 
Ministry. The appellant listed five re- 
quested corrections to the excerpt from 
the report. In its decision letter the 
Ministry advised the appellant that his 
personal information in the report had 
_ been corrected. An amended copy of the 
_ excerpt was attached to the decision with 
_ an internal memo explaining the Minis- 
_try’s position on the requested correc- 
_ tions. 


The record at issue consists of the title 
_ page and parts of two pages of the Special 
Investigation Report. The report con- 
"cernsan investigation into the complaints 
about the mechanical condition of cer- 
_tain public transit buses. The excerpted 
parts of the two pages of the report relate 
to the investigation of a particular inci- 
_dent involving a bus driven by the re- 
-quester/appellant in the course of his 
employment. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld.. 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


In order to determine whether the Min- 
istry’s processing of the appellants re- 
quest for a correction of personal 
information is in accordance with the 
Act, the Inquiry Officer must first deter- 
mine whether the information at issue is 
the personal information of the requester/ 
appellant. The Inquiry Officer found 
that only certain information related to 
the requester/appellant and satisfied the 
definition of personal information under 
section 2(1) ofthe Act. One piece of 
information is a reference to a possible 
operating error committed by the re- 
quester/appellant while applying the 
brakes of the bus he was driving. Another 
piece of information concernsa reference 
to the existence of a letter of reprimand 
against the requester/appellant. The re- 
maining information in the record is not 
personal information about the requester/ 
appellant, rather it is general information 
concerning the investigation of com- 
plaints conducted by the Ministry re- 
garding certain mechanical defects on 
vehicles owned by the requester/appel- 
lant employer. 


Section 47(2) 


The Ministry responded to the requester/ 
appellant request for correction by delet- 
ing all reference to whether the requester 
engaged or disengaged the brakes and by 
deleting the statement which referred to 
the letter. The requester/appellant stated 
that deletion of the information from the 
record is not an acceptable method of 
correction, however, he did not indicate 


the method he prefers. 


In the Inquiry Officer’s view, the appro- 
priate method of correction of personal 
information should be determined by 
taking into account: the nature of the 
record; the method, if any, indicated by 
the requester; and the most practical and 
reasonable method in the circumstances. 
In this appeal, in the absence of any 


specific method of correction requested 
by the requester/appellant, the Ministry 
chose to delete the disputed statements 
from the record. The Inquiry Officer 
found that the Ministry has corrected the 
personal information and that deletion 
of the disputed statement from the record 
was an appropriate method of correction 
in the circumstances of this appeal.

The Town received a request for access to 
the Insurance Advisory Organization 
Report on the current operational status 
of the Fire Departmentand the M. Dillon 
Report concerning the location of the fire 
stations in the Town. The Town denied 
access to the records, claiming section 
11(f) of the Act, The.Insurance Advisory 
Organization Report consists of a three 
page letter with 4 attachments; “Survey 
Recommendations”, “Water Supply”, 
“Fire Department - Fire Suppression 
Forces” and a three page table. The 
report concerning the location of fire 
‘stations is made up ofa title page, a table 
of contents, 12 chapters, a two page table 
and 64 pages of figures. Access to both 


reports was denied pursuant to section 


11(f), (e) and (g). 


14 


ORDER 
The decision of the Town was partially 
upheld. 


Content of Decision Letter 


In his representations, theappellant states 
that the Town has not complied with 
section 22 of the Act because it failed to 
include the reasons the exemptions apply 
to the exempted records. The Inquiry 
Officer dealt with this issue as a prelimi- 
nary matter because the Town’s decision 
letter simply cites the wording of sections 
11(e), (f) and (g) without further reasons 
for applying the exemptions, the Inquiry 
Officer found that this is not sufficient to 
satisfy the requirements of section 22(1) 
of the Act. However, the Inquiry Officer 
went on to say that she did not see any 
purpose in ordering the Town to provide 
a proper notice of refusal letter at this 
stage of the appeal. 


Section 11(e) 


In order for records to qualify under 
section 11(e), the Town must establish 
that the records meet four criteria. The 
first criteria to be met is that the record 
contains positions, plans, procedures, 
criteria or instructions. The Inquiry 
Officer reviewed the records and in her 
view, they did not contain positions, 
plans, procedures, criteria or instructions. 
Both records represent the reported re- 
sult of two studies in relation to the fire 
defences for the Town. Both contained 
recommendations based on observations 
made and data collected. The Town’s 
submission that “release of these records 
could also severely prejudice present and 
future contract negotiations with Town 
fire fighters” is insufficient to establish 
that the records meet the second and 
third criteria which require that the Town 
establish that the records must be in- 
tended to be applied to negotiations and 
that the negotiations must be carried on 
currently or will be carried on in the 
future. Therefore, section 11(e) test has 


not been satisfied and the records do not 
qualify for exemption under that sec- 
tion.* 


Section 11(f) 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 11(f), the Town must establish 
each element of a three part test. First it 
must be established that the record con- 
tains a plan or plans. In the absence of 
sufficient representations setting out the 
facts and circumstances supporting the 
Town’s position, the Inquiry Officer’s 
consideration of the application of the 
exemption was limited to examining any 
relevant information that might be con- 
tained in the records themselves. Having 
examined the records, the Inquiry OF 
ficer concluded that they do not contain 
the sort of detailed methods, schemes or 
designs that are characteristic ofa plan. It 
is evident from the review of the records 
that the authors did not intend them to 
be used as a plan but rather as records 
which provide advice for developing a 
plan or plans to resolve the issues identi- 


fied. Therefore, the first requirement of — 


the test for exemption under section 
11(f) has not been satisfied and the sec- 
tion does not apply to the records at 
issue.* 


Section 11(g) 


In order for records to qualify for exemp- 
tion under section 11(g), the Town must 
establish each element of a two part test. 
The first element of the test is that the - 
record contains information including ~ 
proposed plans, policies or projects. The 
Inquiry Officer reviewed the records and 


in her view, they do not contain the type — 


of information necessary to satisfy the 
first part of the test. It was also the 


Inquiry Officer’s view that the evidence — 


provided by the Town was not sufficient — 


to establish the harm specified in section 
11(d). Therefore, the records do not 


qualify for exemption under this sec- — 


tion.*

The Board received a request for access to 
information relating to an “intellectual 
assessment” of a student. The student 
and her parents all signed the request. 
The Board released some responsive 
records, but denied access to three records, 
the answer booklet for the intelligence 
test, a document entitled “Creativity 
Measure” and an “information checklist 
for referral for giftedness assessment’. 
This information was denied pursuant to 


section 11(h) of the Act. 


During mediation, additional infor- 
mation was released to the requester/ 
appellant. The only information which 
remained at issue consists of portions of 
14 pages from the student’s test answer 
booklet. The answer booklet contains 
the student’s answers and scores, the 
examiner's comments and the suggested 
correct answers. The appellant narrowed 
the scope of the request to include only 
the student’s answers and scores and the 
examiners comments. Therefore, the 
suggested correct answers are outside of 


- the scope of the appeal. 


ORDER 

The Board was ordered to disclose the 
portions of the record which include the 
student’s answers and scores and the 
examiner's comments. 


Section 11(h) 


Section 11(h) states that a head may 
refuse to disclose a record that contains 
questions that are to be used in examina- 
tion or test for an educational purpose. 
In the Assistant Commissioner’s view, 
the portions of the record which remain 
at issue do not contain “questions thatare 
to be used in examination or test” and he 
found that section 11(h) does not apply 
in the circumstances of this appeal. 


- Section 10(1) 


During mediation, the Board also raised 
the application of section 10(1) to the 
remaining portions of the record. In 
order to qualify for exemption under 
section 10, each part of a three part test 
must be satisfied. The first part of the 
test states that the record must reveal in- 
formation that is a trade secret or scien- 
tific, technical, commercial, financial 
or labour relations information.* 


The Board did not identify which of the 
various types of information listed in 
section 10(1) it feels are contained in the 
record. The representations appear to 
suggest that the test questions are trade 
secrets and focus on the rationale for 
denying access to test questions and the 
ability to infer these questions from the 
release of the suggested correct answers. 
Because neither the questions nor the 
suggested correct answers to the ques- 
tions are at issue in the appeal, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner found that it was not 
necessary for him to consider whether 
the suggested correct answers qualify as a 
trade secret for the purposes of section 
10(1). The student’s answers to the 
questions and the examiner's comments 
are clearly not trade secrets and the por- 


tions of the record which remain at issue 
do not contain any of the other types of 
information listed in section 10(1). 
Therefore, this exemption does not ap- 
ply to the record.

Hospital building”. Pursuant to section 
21 of the Act, the City notified six persons 
whose interests could be affected by dis- 
closure of the requested information and 
invited them to make representations 
concerning the release of the study. The 
City received representations from two 
of these individuals. Despite their objec- 
tions to disclosure, the City decided to 
release the study to the requester in its 
entirety. The two individuals who made 
representations appealed the City’s deci- 


sion to grant access tO the requester 5 


ORDER 
The City’s decision to disclose the record 
was upheld. 


Section 10(1)(d) 


One of the appellants submitted that 
“the hospital is already experiencing la- 
bour related repercussions to the pro- 
posed project and we feel that disclosure 
at this time could jeopardize the process 
that is underway to resolve those issues 
(see section 10(1)(d))”. In the Inquiry 
Officer’s view, the information contained 
in the record cannot accurately be char- 
acterized as information “supplied to or 
the report of a conciliation officer, me- 
diator, labour relations officer or other 
person appointed to resolve a labour 
relations dispute”. Therefore, section 
10(1)(d) has no application. However, 
the Inquiry Officer went on to discuss the 
application of sections 10(1)(a), (b) 
and (c). 


Sections 10(1)(a), (b) and (c) 


In order for the documents to qualify for 
exemption under section 10(1), each part 
of a three part test must be met. 


The Inquiry Officer found that the 
information in the record is technical 
and financial in nature. Thus, the first 
part of the three part test is met. The 
second part of the test requires that the 
information he supplied to the City in 


16 


confidence, either implicitly or expli- 
citly. The representations and submis- 
sions of the appellants did not address 
whether the record was supplied in con- 
fidence and there is no mark or evidence 
on the face of the record which would 
indicate confidentiality. Therefore, in 
the Inquiry Officer’s view, part two of the 
test has not been met. The third part of 
the test requires the prospect of disclo- 
sure of the record must give rise to a 
reasonable expectation that one of the 
harms specified in section 10(1)(a), (b) 
or (c) will occur. Although one of the 
appellants submitted that “the hospital is 
currently in the midst of the tendering 
process and ... any publication of in- 
formation concerning this study could 
be prejudicial to the timely completion 
of the project”, no evidence as to why the 
expectation of harm may reasonably be 
expected to result from the disclosure of 
the record has been provided. Therefore, 
the third part of the test has not been met. 
Because neither parts two or three of the 
test has been met, the appellants have not 
established that the exemption provided 
by section 10(1) of the Act applies.* 


Copyright 
One of the affected parties also argued 


that the document in question is a “copy- 
right” document andas such, may not be 
copied in part or in whole without con- 
sent of the authors. Providing access to 
information under the Municipal Free- 
dom of Information and Protection of Pri- 
vacy Act does not constitute an infringe- 
ment of copy right. Specifically, sections 
27(2)(i) and (j) of the Copyright Act pro- 
vide that disclosure of information pur- 
suant to the Federal Access to Information 
Act or any like act of the legislature ‘of a 
province does not constitute an infringe- 
ment of copyright.

The President of the Ontario Secondary 
School Teachers Federation -District 39 
submitted a request to the Board for 
access to the home phone number of 
Federation members. The Board denied 
access to the record containing the phone 
numbers claiming that disclosure would 
be an unjustified invasion of privacy. 


During the course of processing the ap- 
peals, suggestions were made that the 
Federation seek the consent of its mem- 
bers to the release of their home phone 
numbers. The Federation declined to do 
so and both the Federation and the Board 
ultimately decided that theappeal should 
be resolved through the issuance of an 
order. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Both parties agreed that the home phone 
numbers qualify as personal information 
as defined in section 2(1) of the Act. 
Therefore, the sole issue in the appeal is 
whether the mandatory exemption pro- 
vided by section 14 of the Act applies to 
the home phone numbers of perma- 
nently or regularly employed Federation 
members. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Board not to disclose 
the phone numbers was upheld. 


Section 14(1) of the Actprohibits disclo- 
sure of personal information except in 
One such cir- 
cumstance is if the disclosure of the per- 
sonal information does not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 
Sections 14(2) and (3) of the Act provide 


guidance in determining whether disclo- 


certain circumstances. 


sure of personal information would re- 
sult in an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy. Section 14(3) lists the types of 
- information the disclosure of which is 
presumed to constitute an unjustified 
invasion of personal privacy. In this 
appeal, the parties agreed that section 
14(3) is not relevant. Section 14(2) 
provides some criteria to consider in 
determining whether disclosure of per- 
sonal information would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 
Some of the factors listed under section 
14(2) favour disclosure of the records 
and some favour protection of personal 
privacy. Section 14(2)(d) states that a 
head shall consider whether the personal 
information is relevant to a fair determi- 
nation of rights affecting the person who 
made the request. Although the Federa- 
tion states that the personal information 
is relevant because it affects its rights, it 
has not identified these rights or demon- 
strated how disclosure of the personal 
information is relevant to a fair determi- 
nation of these rights. Section 14(2)(d) 
presupposes that there is or will be a 
proceeding in which the requester’s rights 


are to be determined. The Federation 
did not identify any proceeding in which 
its rights are being determined or where 
the disclosure of personal information 
would be relevant to a fair determination 


of these rights. 


The list of factors in section 14(2) is not 
exhaustive and the Federation has raised 
a number of additional factors which are 
not listed. In the Assistant Commission- 
er’s view, the fact that the requester is a 
Federation whichactsas bargaining agent 
on behalf of its members cannot be a 
relevant factor in determining whether 
disclosure of personal information will 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy. Disclosure of a record 
under Part I of the Act is in effect, 
disclosure to the world and not just to the 
requester. Therefore the status of the 
Federation, or the relationship of the 
Federation to its members, is not a rel- 
evant consideration. 


The Federation also argues that the home 
phone numbers should be disclosed pur- 
suant to sections 32(c) and (e) of the Act. 
These sections state that an institution 
shall not disclose personal information 
except for the purpose for which it was 
obtained or compiled or for a consistent 
purpose (section 32(c)); or for the pur- 
pose of complying with an act of the 
legislature or an act of parliament and 
agreement or arrangement under such 
an act or treaty (section 32(e)). Section 
32 is contained in Part II of the Acz. This 
part establishes a set of rules governing 
the collection, retention, use and disclo- 
sure of personal information by institu- 
tions in the course of administering their 
public responsibilities. Section 32 pro- 
hibits disclosure of personal information 
except in certain circumstances; it does 
notcreatearightofaccess. Therefore, the 
factors listed in section 32 are not rel- 
evant to an access request made under 
Part I. Accordingly, the mandatory ex- 
emption provided by section 14(1) ap- 


plies and the phone numbers should not 


be released.

Commissioners of Police

The Police received a request for access to 


the name of a deceased person whose 


body was found in a field. The Police 
provided the requester with partial access 
to a record entitled “Sudden Death Re- 
port”, which set out particulars of the 
discovery of the body, but denied access 
to the name and other identifying par- 
ticulars of the deceased, the individuals 
who discovered the body and the officers 
who attended at the scene. The Police 
severed this information on the grounds 
that disclosure of the severed portions 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of privacy under section 14 of the Act. 
The requester only appealed the decision 
of the Police to deny access to the name 
of the deceased. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Police not to disclose 
the name of the deceased person was 


upheld. 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


In this instance, the name of the deceased 
person appears with other personal 
information of that individual which had 
already been disclosed to the requester/

appellant. This includes the date and the 
time and place of discovery of the de- 
ceased person. Disclosing the deceased 
person’s name would have the effect of 
revealing other personal information 
about that individual. Therefore, in 
these particular circumstances of this 
appeal, the Inquiry Officer found that 
the name of the deceased person qualifies 
as personal information within the mean- 
ing of section 2(1) of the Act. 


Section 2(2) has no application in these 
circumstances because the death occurred 
within the past 30 years. 


Section 14(1) 


Section 14(1) isa mandatory exemption 
which prohibits the disclosure of per- 
sonal information except in certain cir- 
cumstances. Section 14(1)(f) is one such 
circumstance. It states that personal 
information shall not be disclosed except 
if the disclosure does not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 
In the circumstances of this appeal, the 
only representations which the Inquiry 
Officer received weigh in favour of find- 
ing that section 14(1)(f) does not apply. 
In the absence of any evidence or argu- 
ment weighing in favour of finding that 
disclosure of the personal information 
would not constitute an unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy, the Inquiry 
Officer found that the exception con- 
tained in section 14(1)(f) does not apply. 
Therefore, the exemption found in sec- 
tion 14(1) applies to the information.

The Board received a request for access to 
information respecting the salary and 
benefits of the Chief of Police and the 
Deputy Chief of Police. The Board 
denied access pursuant to section 6(1)(b), 
7(1) and 14(3)(£) of the Act Since sec- 
tion 14(4)(a) provides that disclosure of 
salary ranges does not constitute an un- 
justified invasion of personal privacy, 
during mediation, the Board was asked 
to consider disclosing salary ranges as a 
means of settling the appeal. The Board 
indicated that there were no salary ranges 
for the two positions. After the matter 
was considered at a Board meeting, the 
Board refused to establish salary ranges. 
During the inquiry stage of the appeal, 
the Board agreed to disclose the benefits 


information. 


The records which re- ~ 


mained at issue are: an excerpt froma — 
1991 Board meeting; a letter from the — 
Chief of Police to the Board; and a : 


memorandum from the Board’s secre- 


tary to the payroll department regarding — 


salaries. 


ORDER 


The Board was ordered to prepare a _ 


salary range for the positions occupied by — 
the Chief and Deputy Chief of Police — 


and to disclose the ranges to the re- 
quester/appellant. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Section 6(1)(b) 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 6(1)(b), the Board must meet each 
part of a tree part test. The Board must 
establish that: a meeting of a council, 
board, commission or other body or a 
committee of one of them took place; 
and a statute authorizes the holding of 
this meeting in the absence of the public; 
and disclosure of the record at issue would 
reveal the actual substance of the deli- 
berations of this meeting.* There is no 
doubt that a meeting of the Board took 
place. Section 35(4) of the Police Services 
Act gives the Board the discretion to 
exclude members of the public from all 
or part of a meeting. Since meetings in 
the absence of the public are such a 
departure from the norm, there must be 
clear and tangible evidence that the 
meeting or parts of it were actually held 
in camera. For example, evidence could 
consist of a notation in the minutes of a 
meeting that a decision was made that 
the public be excluded while a particular 
agenda item was discussed. In the cir- 
cumstances of this appeal, there is no 
indication in the minutes themselves that 
the meeting or any part of it was actually 
heldin camera. The fact that some of the 
records have been stamped “in camera”, 
in itself, is not sufficient to establish that 
the meeting or part of it was held in 
camera. Therefore, exemption found in 
section 6(1)(b) does not apply. 


Section 7 


Section 7(1) of the Actstates that a head 
may refuse to disclose a record if the 
disclosure would reveal advice or recom- 
mendations of an officer or employee of 
an institution ora consultant retained by 
an institution. “Advice” pertains to the 
submission of a suggested course of ac- 
tion which will ultimately be accepted or 
rejected by its recipient in the deliberative 
process. Recommendations should be 
viewed in the same vein. This exemption 


purports to protect the free flow of advice 
and recommendations within the delib- 
erative process of government decision 
making and policy making. In the Com- 
missioner’s view, the information con- 
tained in the letter from the Chief of 
Police to the Board does not constitute 
advice or recommendations within the 
meaning of section 7 of the Act. A 
decision about two individuals’ salaries is 
not part of the deliberative process of 
government decision-making or policy- 
making. Rather, it is a routine decision 
about an employee or group of employ- 
ees. The letter is more appropriately 
characterized as a request by an employee 
regarding his salary and that of a fellow 
employee. Although the persons respon- 
sible for approving the salaries may have 
considered the employee’s request, such 
a request does not constitute advice or 
recommendations. Therefore, the letter 
does not qualify for exemption under 
section 7(1). 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


The information about the Chief and 
Deputy Chiefsalary is clearly information 
about those individuals and comes within 
the definition of personal information 
contained in section 2(1) of the Act. 


Section 14 


Section 14(1) of the Act is a mandatory 
exemption that prohibits the disclosure 
of personal information except in certain 
circumstances. One such circumstance 
is set out in section 14(1)(f) of the Act 
which states that a head shall refuse to 
disclose personal information except if 
the disclosure does not constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 
Sections 14(2) and (3) of the Actprovide 
euidance in determining whether disclo- 
sure of personal information would re- 
sult in an unjustified invasion of an indi- 
vidual’s personal privacy. Section 14(3) 
lists the types of information the disclo- 
sure of which is presumed to constitute 


an unjustified invasion of personal pri- 
vacy. Section 14(3)(f) states that a disclo- 
sure of personal information is presumed 
to constitute an unjustified invasion of 
personal privacy if the personal in- 
formation describes an individual’s fi- 
nances income, etc.. Because the per- 
sonal information contained in the record 
describes an individual’s income, disclo- 
sure of the personal information would 
constitute a presumed unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy. Section 14(4) of 
the Act outlines a number of circum- 
stances which if they exist could operate 
to rebut a presumption under section 
14(3). Section 14(4)(a) states that de- 
spite subsection 3, a disclosure does not 
constitute an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy if it discloses the classifica- 
tion, salary range and benefits, or em- 
ployment responsibilities of an indivi- 
dual who is or was an officer or employee 
of an institution. In this appeal, section 
14(4)(a) does not apply to rebut the 
presumption contained in section 14(3)(f) 
as the information at issue is the actual 
salary of each affected party, not their 
range of salary. 


After the inquiry process had begun, the 
appellant sent the Commissioner a letter 
which: purported to contain the 
information he was requesting. How- 
ever, the Commissioner was of the view 
that the information contained in the 
letter is nota relevant consideration. The 
appellant also stated that salaries of public 
figures should be available to the public 
thus raising the possible application of 
section 14(2)(a). Without considering 
whether this section applies, the Commis- 
sioner was of the view that the applica- 
tion of this factor alone would not be 
sufficient to rebut presumption. 


Section 16 of the Act states that an ex- 


emption from disclosure of a record un- 
der sections 7, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 does 
not apply if compelling public interest in 


19 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


the disclosure of the record clearly out- 
weighs the purpose of the exemption. 
The Commissioner referred to Order 
M-18, in which he considered the appli- 
cation of section 16 in the context of an 
appeal involving salary information. In 
that order, he stated that the intent of the 
legislature is clear on the balancing of 
rights - the right to access must be bal- 
anced by the right ofan individual to the 
protection of his/her personal privacy. 
Neither right is without limits, which 
limits are also provided for in the Act. In 
that context, the Commissioner was not 
convinced that a compelling public in- 
terest in the disclosure of the exact salaries 
exist, such as to outweigh the purpose of 
the section 14(1) exemption. 


However, the Commissioner went on to 
say that section 14(4)(a) reflects the fact 
that even though disclosure of an exact 
salary is a presumed unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy, disclosure of a salary 
range is not. Section 14(4)(a) is a clear 
indication by the legislature that disclo- 
sure of salary ranges is in the public 
interest. Thatsection isa reflection of the 
view of the legislature as to where the 
appropriate balance between the right to 
know and the right to privacy should be 
struck in the case of salaries of employees 
of taxpayer funded entities. 


The requester/appellant should be al- 
lowed access to some information relat- 
ing to the salaries of the Chiefand Deputy 
Chief. To do otherwise would create an 
absurdity. It would mean that if an 
institution wanted to be less open in the 
area of salary information, it couldachieve 
this by the simple expedient of not hav- 
ing salary ranges for its employees. Since 
the potential disclosure of exact salaries 
have the benefit of a presumed unjusti- 
fied invasion of personal privacy, it is 
unlikely, in most circumstances, that any 
salary related information would beavail- 
able to the public. In the Commission- 


20 


er’s view, this is not the result which was 
intended by the legislature. Pursuant to 
section 43(3) of the Act, the Commis- 
sioner ordered the Board to prepare sal- 
ary ranges and to disclose them to the 
requester/appellant.

The Board received a request for access to 
records relating to a student attending a 
school within the Board’s jurisdiction. 
The requester is the student’s natural 
father. The student was under the age of 
16 at the time the request was made. The 
Board identified a number of responsive 
records and denied access pursuant to 
section 14(1) of the Act. During the 
course of mediation, the scope of the 
appeal was narrowed by the parties to one 
record, a hard copy of a “registration 
maintenancescreen” forthestudent. This 
record is a computer print out which 


identifies the individuals the Board should 
contact inan emergency. Itlists the name 
of the student, the address and telephone 
number of the student’s mother and her 
mother’s spouse and certain additional 
information concerning the student's liy- 
ing and guardianship arrangements. [he 
student, her mother and her mother’s 
spouse all refused to consent to the release 


of the record. 


ORDER 
The Board’s decision not to disclose the 
record was upheld. 


Section 54(c) 


The Assistant Commissioner dealt with 
the preliminary issue regarding the appli- 
cation of section 54(c) of the Act. This 
section addresses the rights of certain 
individuals as they relate to children un- 
der the age of 16. It states that any right 
or power conferred on an individual by 
the Actmay be exercised, if the individual 
is less than 16 years of age, by a person 
who has lawful custody of the individual. 
During the course of the appeal, the 
requester/appellant submitted a copy of 
a divorce decree which makes it clear that 
he does not have “lawful custody” of the 


student. Therefore, section 54(c) does 
not apply. 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


The record at issue contains the address 
and telephone numbers of the student's 
mother and her mother’s spouse, as well 
as certain information containing the 
student’slivingand guardianship arrange- 
ments. In the Assistant Commissioner’s 
view, this information qualifies as a per- 
sonal information of the student, her 
mother and her mother’s spouse. None 
of the information is the personal 
information of the appellant. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/

Section 14 


Section 14(1) of the Actprohibits disclo- 
sure of personal information except in 
certain circumstances. One such cir- 
cumstance is contained in section 14(1)(f) 
of the Actwhich states that the head shall 
refuse to disclose personal information 
except if the disclosure does not consti- 
tute an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy. Sections 14(2) and (3) of the Act 
provide guidance in determining whether 
disclosure of personal information would 
result in an unjustified invasion of per- 
sonal privacy. None of the parties to the 
appeal raised any of the presumptions 
contained in section 14(3). Therefore, 
that section is not relevant in the circum- 
stances of the appeal. Section 14(2) lists 


factors which may be considered in de- - 


termining whether the disclosure of per- 
sonal information would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 
None of the parties refer specifically to 
any of these factors, however, because the 
list is not exhaustive,. the Assistant 
Commissioner considered other factors 
raised by the various parties. 


The requester/appellant argued that the 
student is a minor and as her natural 
father, he is entitled to information con- 
cerning her well being. He further ar- 
gued that the divorce decree grants him 
the right to make reasonable inquiries 
and to receive information as to health, 
education, etc. regarding the children, 
regardless of their age or custody. After 
carefully reviewing the record and the 
representations, in the Assistant Com- 
missioner’s view, the reasons submitted 
by the appellant in favour of disclosure 
are not sufficient to overcome the man- 
datory exemption provided by section 
14(1) ofthe Act. In order for the Assistant 
Commissioner to find that section 


14(1)(f) exception applies, he must find 


__ thatdisclosure of the personal information 


would not constitute an unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy. In the Assistant 


Commissioner’s view, the appellant/re- 
quester failed to provide evidence suffi- 
cient to raise this exception, either with 
respect to personal information of the 
student, her mother or the mother’s 
spouse. Therefore, the record qualifies 


for exemption under section 14(1) of the 
Act.

The Board received a request for access to 
a copy of the rationale which a named 
individual provided to the Board regard- 
ing his three motions on the Key Com- 
municator Program. The Board invited 
the individual to make representations as 
to why the record or parts thereof should 
not be disclosed. Despite the individual’s 
objection to disclosure, the Board de- 
cided to grant access to the record. The 
individual appealed the Board’s decision. 
The record responsive to the request is a 
three-page document entitled “Back- 
ground to Key Communicator Motion 
of January 15, 1992” and is identified as 
background material to a motion made 
by the appellant within his responsibili- 
ties as trustee in a public board meeting. 


ORDER 

The decision of the Board to disclose the 
information was upheld with the excep- 
tion of the appellant’s home address. 


Section 2 - Personal Information 


In the Inquiry Officer’s view, the appel- 
lant’s views and opinions about the Board 
program were expressed in his capacity as 
a public elected official and are not “per- 
sonal” opinions or views. These views 
and opinions cannot be categorized as 
“personal information” as defined in sec- 
tion 2(1) of the Act. Part of the record 
contains the appellant’s home address 
and this part of the record qualifies as the 
appellant’s personal information.

disclosure of the personal information 
would not constitute an unjustified inva- 
sion of personal privacy, the Inquiry 
Officer found that the exception con-

gram’. 


ORDER 
The Board’s decision to disclose the

Section 2 - Personal Information 


The opinions and views expressed by the 
appellant in the records are in relation to 
a Board program and are identified as 
background material to a motion he 
made in a public board meeting, within 
his responsibilities as an elected school 
trustee. Therefore, they are not “per- 
sonal” opinions or views. These views 
and opinions cannot be categorized as 
personal information as defined in sec- 
tion 2(1) of the Act. Views and opinions 
expressed by the appellant in relation to 
other individuals are properly considered

duals and do not qualify as a personal 
information of the appellant. A part of 
one record contains the appellant’s home 
address and, in the Inquiry Officer’s view, 
only this information qualifies as the 
appellant’s personal information.

Section 14(1) 


Onceithas been determined thata record 
contains personal information, section 
14(1) of the Act prohibits the disclosure 
of this information except in certain cir- 
cumstances. One such circumstance is 
upon the prior written request or consent 
of the individual, if the record is one to 
which the individual is entitled to have 
access (section 14(1)(a)). Each of the 
persons about whom a view or opinion 
has been expressed has provided written 
consent to disclosure of their personal 
information to the requester. Therefore, 


section 14(1)(a) applies to the appellant’s © 


views and opinions about these indivi- 
duals. Accordingly, the mandatory ex- 
emption provided by section 14(1) of the 
Act does not apply and the information 
should be disclosed to the requester. 


The Inquiry Officer went on to find that 
the only personal information relating to 
the requester, namely his home address is 
properly exempt from disclosure under 
section 14(1) of the Act.

The City received a request for the notes 
and scores from each of the Re-Evalua- 
tion Committee members who con- 
ducted the re-evaluation of the position 
of the Committee’s secretary position. 
The request was clarified to include the 
handwritten notes and score sheets of 
two other persons who, while not voting 
members of the Committee, were present 
at the Re-Evaluation Committee meet- 
ing and contributed to the process. The 
City denied access to the records pursu- 
ant to sections 11(c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) 
of the Act. The records consist of five one 
page job evaluation forms completed by 
the members of the committee and 17 


pages of notes taken by them. 


ORDER 
The City was ordered to disclose the 
records to the appellant. 


Sections 11(c) and (d) : 


Section 11(c) states that a head may 
refuse to disclose a record that contains 
information whose disclosure could rea- 
sonably be expected to prejudice the 
economic interest of an institution or the 
competitive position of an institution. 
Section 11(d) states that a head may 
refuse to disclose a record that contains 
information whose disclosure could rea- 
sonably be expected to be injurious to the 
financial interest of an institution. With 
respect to both sections, the City argued 
that if the information contained in the 
records is disclosed, it could be misused 
to convince an arbitrator to increase the 


rate of pay for secretaries in the Clerk’s 
Office. It further submits that such a pay 
increase could possibly result in corre- 
sponding pay increases for many other 
employees throughout the organization 
and that this would have a profound 
impact on the economic interest of the 
City. The Inquiry Officer found that the 
evidence provided by the City was not 
sufficiently detailed and convincing to 
demonstrate a reasonable expectation of 
harm. The City failed to make the 
necessary connection between the dis- 
closure of the information in the records 
in any specific use or misuse of it that 
could reasonably be expected to preju- 
dice or harm the City’s financial or eco- 
nomic interest. Therefore, the records 


do not qualify for exemption under sec- 
tions 11(c) and (d). 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 11(e) of the Act, the City must 
meet each part ofa four part test. In order 
to meet the first part of the test the City 
must establish that the record contains 
positions, plans, procedures, criteria or 
instruction. After examining the records, 
the Inquiry Officer concluded that they 
do not contain positions, plans, criteria 
or instruction but rather consist of score 
sheets and handwritten notes. Since part 
I of the test has not been met, the records 
do not qualify for exemption under sec- 
tion 11(e).* 


For a record to qualify for exemption 
under section 11(f) of the Acz, the City 
must establish that a record satisfies each 
element of a three part test. The first 
element of the test is that the record must 
contain a plan or plans. Again, after 
reviewing the records, the Inquiry OF 
ficer noted that they consist of point 
score sheets and handwritten notes used 
by the members of the job evaluation 
committee and others present during the 
course of two meetings. In his view, the 
records at issue do not contain a plan or 


23

plans and therefore, do not qualify for 
exemption under section 11 (f).* 


In order to qualify for exemption under 
section 11(g), the City must establish 
that the record satisfies each element of a 
two part test. The Inquiry Officer com- 
mented that even if he were prepared to 
accept that the records contain proposed 
plans, policies, projects or other similar 
information (part I of the test), he was 
not persuaded that their disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to result in any 
financial loss to the City (part 2 of the 
test). The City’s concern appears to be 
based on possible misuse of the 
information by others. Any harm that 
may accrue to the institution must result 
from the disclosure of the records them- 
selves rather than any potential harm asa 
result of the information in the records 
being misused. Therefore, the records do 
not qualify for exemption under section 


11(g).*

Institution: Ministry of Health

KEYWORDS 


use ® disclose * consistent 


An employee of the Ministry was sus- 
pended due to alleged difficulties with 
her job performance and complaints re- 
ceived by the Ministry. The employee 
filed a grievance regarding her treatment 
during the suspension and the resulting 
change in her working conditions. Dur- 
ing the course of the grievance proceed- 
ings, the Ministry conducted an investi- 
gation where it disclosed the employee’s 
personal information to other past and 
present Ministry employees. In order to 
contact these Ministry employees, the 
Ministry used their personal information. 
The employee complained that the dis- 
closure of her personal information and 
the use of the Ministry employees’ per- 
sonal information were contrary to the 
Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the Ministry em- 
ployees’ personal information— names, 
telephone numbers and addresses, was 
obtained or compiled for employment- 
related purposes. The IPC also found 
thatthe personal information was used to 
contact Ministry employees in order to 
discuss information about the complain- 
ant relating to the time of the employees’ 


26 


employment with the Ministry. The 
IPC concluded that the use of the per- 
sonal information was fora purpose con- 
sistent with the purpose for obtaining or 
compiling the personal information. 
Further, it was the IPC’s view that the 
employees might reasonably have ex- 
pected such a use of their personal 
information. Therefore, the use of the 
personal information was considered to 
be for a consistent purpose, and was thus 
in compliance with section 41(b) of the 


Act. 


The IPC determined that the complain- 
ant’s personal information,.i.e. that she 
had filed a grievance and that allegations 
ofacertain nature had been made against 
her, was obtained by the Ministry for the 
purpose of responding to the complain- 
ant’s grievance and inquiring into the 
allegations made concerning her. Sec- 
tion 42(c) of the Act states that an insti- 
tution shall not disclose personal 
information except for the purpose for 
which it was obtained or compiled. The 
IPC found that the personal information 
was disclosed for the purpose of enabling 
the Ministry to inquire into these allega- 
tions and appropriately respond to the 
complainant’s grievance. Therefore, the 
IPC concluded that the personal 
information was disclosed for the pur- 
pose for which it was obtained or com- 
piled and that the disclosure was in com- 
pliance with section 42(c) of the Act.

The complainant, an employee of the 
Ministry, had been absent from work for 
several days. The Ministry requested 
that he submit a medical certificate. Two 
certificates he provided were judged by 
the Ministry to contain insufficient 
information. The Director requested a 
third medical certificate. The complain- 
ant’s doctor sent the third certificate di- 
rectly to the Human Resources Branch, 


~ although the Ministry’s usual practice 


was for the employee's supervisor to re- 
ceive medical certificates. 


The Human Resources Advisor assured 
the doctor that the certificate would be 
placed in the complainant’s personnel 
file, and would be kept confidential. The 
Human Resources Advisor told the com- 
plainant’s manager and supervisor about 
thecomplainant’s medical condition, and 
that the doctor had recommendeda work 
transfer. 


The Ministry later used the medical cer- 


tificate as evidence at a hearing to resolve 


a grievance by the complainant about 


alleged harassment by the Ministry in 
placinga certain document in his person- 
nel file. In preparation for the hearing, 
the supervisor reviewed the documents 
in the complainant's file, including the 


_ medical certificate. The Ministry's posi- 
\ 


tion was that this disclosure to the super- 
visor had been inadvertent. The com- 


_ plainant believed that the Ministry had 


breached his privacy by using the medical 


_ certificate as evidence, and by disclosing 
_ the certificate to his supervisor and other 


employees. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the medical certifi- 
cate contained the complainant’s “per- 
sonal information” as defined in section 
2(1) of the Act. The Ministry had not 
provided proper notice of collection for 
the personal information in accordance 


with section 39(2) of the Act. 


It was determined that the Ministry had 
used the personal information at the 
grievance hearing in accordance with 
section 42(b) of the Act (i.e for a consist- 
ent purpose) since the complainant could 
have reasonably expected that documents 
in his personnel file would be used if he 
grieved placement of a document in the 


file and being harassed. 


The medical certificate was not disclosed 
to the supervisor in accordance with sec- 
tion 42(d) of the Actbecause the supervi- 
sor did not need the detailed medical 
information to perform his job duties. 
The medical certificate was disclosed to 
the Director, and to the human resources, 
payroll, benefits and labour relations staff 
in accordance with section 42(d) of the 


Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that the Minis- 


try: 


1. Provide proper notice of collection 
when it required employees to submit 


medical information; provide employees ~ 
with complete and specific instruction, 


as to what information was required. 


2. Develop a procedure to ensure that 
medical certificates are treated in a confi- 
dential manner, and that only employees 
and officers who need this information in 
the performance of their duties are given 
access. 


3. Develop a written policy on access to 
employees’ personnel files to ensure that 


only employees and officers who need 
this information in the performance of 
their duties are given access. 


4. Return collections of medical certifi- 
cates being held by non-human resources 
staff to the Human Resources Branch in 
a confidential manner; the Human Re- 
sources Branch should ensure that any 
duplicates are destroyed in a confidential 
manner.

COMMISSIONER/

CONCLUSION 


The IPC found that the complainant's 
OHIP number and photograph were his 
“personal information”, as defined in 
section 2(1) of the Act. Both the OHIP 
number and photograph were collected 
in accordance with section 38(2) of the 
Act, since their collection was necessary 
to the proper administration ofa lawfully 
authorized activity (i.e. tracing indivi- 
duals, assisting in enforcing warrants, 
and serving documents personally). The 
OHIP number had been used in accord- 
ance with section 41(b) of the Act, for the 
purpose for which it was obtained, and 
not to obtain access to medical 
information. 


The IPC found that the address used to 
serve the Notice of Intention to Garnishee 
was the address of a central garnishment 
registry of the federal Department of 
Justice. Therefore, the address was not 
the complainant’s “personal infor- 
mation”, as defined in section 2(1) of the 
Act, and section 40(2) of the Actdid not 
apply. Since the complainant was an 
employee of Revenue Canada, which is 
not an institution under the Act, the 
privacy provisions of the Act did not 
apply to any disclosures within the com- 
plainant’s workplace.

The complainant, a real estate salesper- 
son, completed a form when he applied 
to the Ministry for the registration of a 
change of employer. This form asked for 
information which included, among 
other things, the complainant’s name, 
present address, telephone number and 
his real estate registration number. Be- 
fore submitting the form to the Ministry, 
the complainant was required to have his 
new employer sign the form. The com- 
plainant questioned whether his personal 
information had been collected and re- 
tained by the Ministry in accordance 
with the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the Ministry’s 
collection of the complainant’s personal 
information was expressly authorized by 
the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act 
(the REBBA). Therefore, the Ministry's 
collection was in accordance with section 


38(2) of the Act. 


The IPC also determined that the com- 
plainant’s employer did not provide any 
additional information about the com- 
plainant. If he had, then the Ministry’s 
collection of this information from the 
employer would have been authorized 
under Regulation 986 of the REBBAand 
would have been in accordance with 


section 39(1) of the Act. 


The IPC determined that the Ministry 
collected the complainant’s personal 
information in order to update 
information already in its custody and 
control. The IPC concluded that, there- 
fore, the Ministry used the complain- 
ant’s personal information for the pur- 
pose for which it had been collected. The 
Ministry was, thus, in compliance with 


section 41(b) of the Act. 


The IPC found that the completed forms 
were stored in a secure data control loca- 
tion at the Ministry. The forms were 


microfilmed and after 60 days the origi- 
nal forms were shredded. Only author- 
ized staff had access to the microfilms. 
The IPC concluded that the Ministry 


was in compliance with section 4 of 


Regulation 516/90 under the Act.

The complainant stated that she had

The complainant asked the IPC to en- 
sure that the Ministry would never again

It is the practice of the Ministry to dis- 


close the names and addresses of indivi- —

CONCLUSION 
The Ministry agreed in writing, not to

The complainant objected to a decision 


that the WCB had made concerning his 


~ original claim file, and subsequently re- 
quested a copy of both his original and 
_ new claim files. 


The complainant believed that when the 
WCB had sent him a copy of his claim 
files, it had also sent a copy of the same 
information to his employer, although 


he had not consented to this disclosure. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the complain- 
ant’s claim files contained the complain- 
ant’s personal information, as defined in 
section 2(1) of the Act. 


The IRC found no evidence that the 
WCB had disclosed a copy of the com- 
plainant’s claim files to the complain- 
ant’s employer, at the same time it had 
released a copy to the complainant. 


The IPC did, however, find evidence of 
the WCB having disclosed the com- 
plainant’s personal information to the 
complainant's employer, for the purpose 
of processing and monitoring the status 
of the complainant's claim. The IPC 
concluded that this type of disclosure is 
permitted under section 42(c) of the Act, 
because it constitutes a consistent pur- 
pose and one which could reasonably be 
expected under the circumstances.

An association of legal aid clinics com- 
plained that the Ministry of the Attorney 
General (MAG) had requested legal aid 
clinics to provide the Family Benefits Act 
(FBA) and General Welfare Assistance Act 
(GWA) client numbers for services pro- 
vided by the clinics in 1989-90. This 
information was to be given to the Min- 
istry of Community and Social Services 
(MCSS) so that it could make a cost- 
sharing claim under the federal Canada 


Assistance Plan (CAP), on behalf of the 
MAG. The members of the association 
were of the view that the proposed collec- 
tions of personal information by the 


MAG and the MCSS were improper. 


CONCLUSION 


192-61P: Complaint concerning the 
MAG: 


The IPC determined that the Ontario 
Legal Aid Office, and not the MAG, had 
collected the client FRA/GWA numbers 
and would be forwarding them to the 
MCSS. (The MAG would not have ac- 
cess to this information.) Since, how- 
ever, the Ontario Legal Aid Office was 
not.an institution under the Act, it did 
not fall within the Commissioner’s juris- 
diction. 


However, the IPC noted that the On- 
tario Legal Aid Office had collected the 
information at the request of the MAG. 
The IPC was of the view, therefore, that 
the MAG should have provided advice or 
direction so that Ontario Legal Aid, while 
not an institution under the Act, could 
have complied with the provisions of the 
Act, or at least within the “spirit” of the 
Act. 


In reply to this observation, the MAG 
stated that while it was not obliged to do 
so, it would in the future, offer any 
necessary advice/direction in a similar 
situation so that an agency not falling 
under the Act could, nevertheless, act 
within the spirit of the Act. 


192-56P: Complaint against the MCSS: 
The IPC determined that the MCSS’s 


activity of administrating cost sharing 
claims under CAP on behalf of other 
provincial ministries, was a lawfully au- 
thorized activity. The IPC also deter- 
mined that in this case, the MCSS needed 
to provide proof that the services per- 


formed by the Legal Aid clinics had been 


29 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


to “persons in need”. Federal authorities 
had agreed to accept, as proof of “persons 
in need”, proof of eligibility under FBA/ 
GWA. Verifying the collected FBA/ 
GWA client numbers provided this proof. 


The IPC, therefore, concluded that the 
MCSS’s proposed collection was neces- 
sary for the proper administration of a 
lawfully authorized activity, and was thus, 
in accordance with section 38(2) of the 


Act. 


The MCSS’s proposed collection in- 
volved the indirect collection of personal 
information. Under section 39(1) of the 
Act, personal information may only be 
collected directly from the individual to 
whom the information relates, except in 
the circumstances outlined in this sec- 
tion. The IPC examined section 39(1) 
and concluded that since none of the 
circumstances were applicable in this case, 
the MCSS’s proposed collection was not 
in accordance with this section of the Act. 


In addition, since the MCSS had not 
given notice, nor did it appear to intend 
to give notice as required under section 
39(2), its proposed collection was not in 
accordance with this section of the Acz. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended to the MCSS 


that it: 


1. provide the IPC with written assur- 
ances that it would take all precautions to 
ensure the security and confidentiality of 
the personal information while in its 
custody and control; that it would even- 
tually return this information to the Le- 
gal Aid Office; that it would not use the 
personal information for any purpose 
other than for verifying eligibility; and 
that it would not record or retain the fact 
that the FBA/GWA recipients had also 
been in receipt of Legal Aid; 


30 


2. should request a waiver of notice from 
the responsible minister, if it did not 
intend to give notice of its indirect collec- 
tion; and 


3. should take steps to ensure that in 
future, it would collect personal 
information in accordance with the pro- 
visions of the Acz. 


The MCSS’s reply indicated that it had 
either complied with or would be com- 
plying with the IPC’s recommendations.

disclose ° WCB 


An individual had filed an appeal of a 
Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) 
decision to the Workers’ Compensation 
Appeals Tribunal (WCAT). She found 
that after her appeal had been filed, the 
WCB had sent reports about her from a 
psychiatric institute to the WCAT. The 
complainant believed that her privacy 
had been breached by the disclosure for 


the following reasons: 


1. the records were not relevant to the 
appeal, because the WCB had not al- 
lowed them to be entered as evidence in 


the original WCB hearing; 


2. the WCB had not severed highly 
sensitive information about her in the 
records before disclosing them to the 


WCAT. 


CONCLUSION 
The IPC’s view was that once the WCB 
received the Notice of Appeal, it had a 


statutory obligation under section 89(3) 
of the Workers’ Compensation Act (the 
WCA) to transmit the records relating to 
the appeal to the WCAT. The disclo- 
sure, therefore, had been made in accord- 
ance with section 42(e) of the Ac¢, for the 
purpose of complying with an act of the 
Legislature. 


The IPC determined that the WCB’s 
practice was to send its complete file to 
the WCAT. The IPC was unable to find 
a statutory requirement under the WCA 
to support the complainant’s position 
that the records in question should have 
been severed by the WCB before being 
disclosed to the WCAT.

The complainant wrote that the Office 
of Francophone Affairs (the Office) and 
a Ministry had exchanged his personal 
information. He provided a letter from 
the Office to him, which detailed the 
personal information the Office had re- 
ceived from the Ministry. 


The Office advised the IPC that the 
complainant had filed a complaint with 
the Office that the Ministry had not 
provided service in French. Asa result, it 
was necessary for the Office to contact 
the Ministry and to provide sufficient 
details of the complaint so that the Min- 
istry could reply. 


The Office advised the IPC that they had 
not disclosed the complainant’s name to 
the Ministry. However, because of the 
nature of the complaint, the Ministry 
knew who the complainant was. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that any personal 
information that the Office might have 
disclosed was for a consistent purpose, 
pursuant to the provisions of section 
42(c) ofthe Act. The Office had collected 
the complainant’s personal information 
directly from him when he filed a com- 
plaintunder the French Language Services 


Actagainst the Ministry. In order for the 
Office to process his complaint, the Of- 
fice had to contact the Ministry and 
disclose certain details of the complaint. 
The complainant could have expected 


sucha disclosure to the Ministry, as it was 


necessary to process his complaintagainst

The complainant wrote that the Minis-

ordinator (FLS Co-ordinator) had access 
to his appeal file during an appeal hearing 
before the Metro Toronto Housing Au- 
thority (the MTHA), an agency of the 
Ministry. 


The Ministry advised the IPC that the 
complainant had insisted that the hear- 
ing be conducted in French. However, 
there were no MTHA board members 
who were sufficiently bilingual to con- 
duct the hearing. Asa result, the board 
asked the Ministry to provide a suitable 
bilingual person to chair the hearing. 


The Ministry determined that the FLS 
Co-ordinator was the most suitable can- 
didate. To brief the Chair for this hear- 
ing, certain records had to be made avail- 
able. Because of the nature of the hear- 
ing, some of it was personal information. 
However it was deemed necessary to 
disclose this personal information to the 
PLS Co-ordinator so that he could per- 
form his duties as the Chair. The FLS 


Co-ordinator would be incapable of car- 
rying out his duties as Chair without the 
information in question.

An employee of the Board complained 
about the Board’s installation of a closed 
circuit television system (CCTV). He 
believed that it was unnecessary to place 
cameras in the general office areas. He 
was also concerned that employees had 
not been clearly informed as to how the 
video tape recordings would be used or 
who would be viewing them. 


CONCLUSION 

The Board’s position was that the CCTV 
monitoring was purely for security rea- 
sons and not for the purpose of employee 
surveillance. 


The IPC determined that the Board’s 
activity of protecting its personnel and 
assets was a lawfully authorized activity 
pursuant to section 3(c) and 3(n) of the 
Liquor Control Act. However, it was the 
IPC’s view that the Board’s collection of 
personal information through video cam- 
eras located in the corridors of the third 
and fourth floors during office hours was 


Si 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


not necessary to the proper administra- 
tion of this activity and, therefore, was 
not in accordance with section 38(2) of 


the Act. 


The IPC determined that the Board’s 
collection was notin accordance with the 
notice provisions of section 39(2) of the 
Act. The Board acknowledged that it had 
not provided notice as required but pro- 
posed to post a notice at the main and 
side entrances to its main building. 


The IPC found that the Board was in 
compliance with the retention require- 
ments of section 40(1) of the Act except 
when it “used” a video tape recording. 
The IPC’s view was that “use” included 
such activities as viewing and reviewing 
and not simply collecting and storing 
tapes until such time as they were re- 
recorded. 


The IPC also found that on one occa- 
sion, the Board had disclosed.a video tape 
recording to an employee’s supervisor 
who did not have the authority to view 
the tape. This disclosure was contrary to 
section 42 of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that the Board 
should: 


1. De-activate the cameras located in the 
corridors of the third and fourth floors 
during working hours, and activate them 
only after regular office hours. 


2. Implement its proposal to post the 
required notice of collection at the main 
and side entrances to the main building. 


3. Comply with the retention require- 
ments of the Act, when it “use” video tape 
recordings and to consider developing 
procedures for identifying which video 
tapes would be used and which would 
not.

4, Implement its proposal to develop

The complainants were family members 
of an individual who had been employed 
by the School Board. He had been 
charged with sexual interference with 
respect to two pupils at the school where 
he had worked. Shortly after being 
charged, the individual had taken his 
own life. It was the complainants’ view 
that the School Board had improperly 
disclosed 1) the charges against the in- 
dividual to the school staff; 2) the suicide 
of the individual to the school staff; 

3) the charges against the individual to 
parents of children attending the school. 


CONCLUSION 

1. Section 27 of the Actstates that Part II 
of the Act does not apply to personal 
information that is maintained for the 
purpose of creating a record that is avail- 
able to the general public. It was the 
IPC’s view that once the individual had 
been charged and “an information” had 
been laid and filed in court, the 
information concerning the charges 
against him was personal information to 
which section 27 was applicable. How- 
ever, the IPC was unable to determine 
exactly when the charges had been laid, 
and when an information had been laid 


and filed in court. The IPC was, there- 
fore, unable to determine if section 27 
was applicable to the disclosure by the 
School Board of the charges against the 
individual to the school staff. Thus,the 
IPC was unable to determine if the dis- 
closure was in accordance with the Act. 
Nevertheless, the IPC was of the view 
that the School Board should have con- 
sidered waiting until it knew for certain 
that charges against the individual had 
been laid (i.e. after the information had 
been filed in the provincial court), before 
informing its staff. 


2. The School Board stated that the 
disclosure of the individual’s suicide was 
made in the discharge of its duties to staff 


_and students and, therefore, had com- 


plied with section 32(h) of the Act. How- 
ever it was the IPC’s view that the disclo- 
sure by the School Board was not made 
to an employee or officer of the Board 
who needed the specific information 
about the individual’s suicide in the per- 
formance of his or her duties, conse- 
quently the disclosure was not consid- 
ered to be necessary and proper to the 
discharge of the School Board’s func- 
tions. The IPC determined that the dis- 
closure of the individual’s suicide was not 
in accordance with the Act. 


3. The IPC found no evidence that the 
School Board had disclosed information 
about the charges against the individual 
to the parents of children attending the 
school. | 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. Prior to disclosing the existence of 
criminal charges against an employee, 
the School Board should confirm that 
the information was contained ina record 
available to the general public, i.e. in an 
information filed in court.

2. The School Board should examine its

and tragic events to ensure that it did not 
contravene the provisions of the Actand 
to make any necessary amendments. 


3. The School Board should take steps to 


ensure that its staff were made aware of 


the requirements of the Act so that in 


future, all disclosures of personal 


information were made in accordance

_ The complainants were family members 
~ ofan individual who had been employed 


by a school board. The individual had 


_been arrested and charged with sexual 


interference with respect to two pupils at 
the school where he had worked. Shortly 
after he had been charged, the individual 


~ had taken his own life. According to the 


complainants, the Police had improperly 


disclosed information as follows: 1) al- 


though assurances had been given to the 
individual’s family, the Police disclosed 
his suicide to the school board; 2) a police 


_ officer, who was not involved in the’ 


investigation of the charges or the sui- 


cide, told his wife of the suicide; 3) the 


Police also provided details of the suicide 


to a local newspaper. 


CONCLUSION 
1. The Police advised that in order to 
meet certain objectives it was necessary 


_to disclose the suicide of the individual to 


the school board. In addition, the Police 


was of the view that the disclosure was 
consistent with the Coroner’ Actand the 
Police Services Act, and, therefore, it was 
in accordance with section 32(c) of the 


Act. 


It was the IPC’s view that the Police did 
not need to disclose that the individual 
had committed suicide,— only that he 
had died, in order to meet its objectives. 
The IPC also examined the legislation 
relied upon by the Police for its disclo- 
sure. However, the IPC did not find that 
the disclosure was in accordance with 
section 32(c) since it was not for a pur- 
pose for which the information had been 
collected or fora consistent purpose. The 
IPC concluded that the disclosure of the 
individual’s suicide to the school board 
was not in accordance with the Acz. 


2. The Police advised that the disclosure 
by the police officer to his wife had been 
made in compassionate circumstances. 
The officer knew that his wife, who was 
related to the individual’s wife, would 
want to contact the family to offer her 
sympathy and support. 


Section 32(i) of the Act permits disclo- 
sure in compassionate circumstances to 
facilitate contact with the next of kin or 
a friend of an individual who is injured, 
ill or deceased. It was the IPC’s view that 
under this section of the Act, the disclo- 
sure must be made both in compassion- 


ate circumstances and to assist in locating 


the next of kin or friend of the individual 
involved. The IPC found that in this 
case, although the disclosure was made 
in compassionate circumstances, it was 
not made to facilitate contact with the 
individual’s next of kin, since family 
members were already at his home when 
the police officer’s wife telephoned. 


The IPC found that the disclosure by the 
police officer to his wife was not in 
accordance with the Act. 


3. The IPC found no evidence that the 
Police had disclosed information about 
the individual’s suicide to the newspaper, 
contrary to the Act. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. When the Police are requested by 
victims of tragedy to maintain confiden- 
tiality about a tragic event, their wishes 
should be respected to the greatest extent 
possible. 


2. Where such a request is made in the 
context of a suicide, the Police should 
disclose only that the individual has died. 
It was the IPC’s view that only in an 
unusual case, would it be appropriate to 
disclose a suicide to persons other than to 
the individual’s immediate family. 


3. The Police should take steps to ensure 
that its staff are made fully aware of the 
requirements of the Act, so that in future, 
all disclosures are made in accordance 


with the Act. 


In reply to our third recommendation, 
the Police advised of a number of meas- 
ures it had already undertaken.

to submit forms containing their medi- 
cal information to the Municipality. The 
forms were then forwarded to the insur-

The complainant, an employee of the 
Municipality, objected to Treasury staff 
having access to her confidential medical 
information. The insuring companies 


had advised that she could send the forms 
directly to them. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC reviewed the forms, and con-

“necessary” to the proper administration 
of a lawfully authorized activity, namely 
the administration of benefits. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. The Municipality should cease collec-

2. Any revised forms should neither re-

will no longer collect the forms in their 
present format, and that when new forms

An employee complained thata Munici- 
pal Board of Education used the services 
of professional investigators to videotape 
his activities during working hours. This 
information was used to terminate the 
complainants employment with the 
Board and was subsequently used and 
disclosed by the Board at a grievance 
hearing into the complainant's dismissal. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that a videotape 
recording of an individual was recorded 
personal information about the indivi- 
dual, as defined under section 2(1) of the 
Act. The IPC was also of the view that the 
investigator's reports were personal 
information. 


The IPC also concluded that the video 
surveillance was justified and necessary 
because the Board had reasonable grounds 
to believe that the complainant was en- 
gaging in some other form of activity, 
during his working hours. Therefore, 
the Board used video surveillance to col- 
lect the necessary evidence of the com- 
plainant’s unauthorized activities. The 
Board required this evidence in order to 
take disciplinary or other action against 
the employee, and to justify its actions in 
any subsequent grievance proceedings. 
It was the IPC’s view that the collection 
of personal information was necessary in 
order for the Board to properly exercise 
one of its lawfully authorized manage- 
ment functions, that of discharging one 
of its employees for just cause. 


The IPC determined that the complain- 
ant had not been notified of the collec- 
tion of personal information until after 
the collection had taken place. There- 
fore, the Board did not comply with the 
notice provisions of the Act at the time of 
the collection. 


The IPC concluded that the Board had 
collected the personal information to 
determine if it could exercise its right 
under the collective agreement, to dis- 
charge the employee for just cause. The 
Board subsequently used this information 
to terminate the complainant’s employ- 
mentand used it at the ensuing grievance 
filed by the employee. Therefore, it was 
the IPC’s view that the Board used the © 
information for the purpose for which it 
was collected. 


The IPC also concluded that it was not 
unreasonable for the complainant to ex- 
pect that the Board would disclose the 
personal information it had collected, at 
the grievance hearing. Therefore, the 
Board disclosed the complainant's per- 
sonal information, in compliance with — 


the Act.

social insurance number, date of birth, 
financial records, medical records, mari- 
tal status, receipts for political party do- 
nations, and spousal information where 
joint returns are filed. 


The Licensing Commission contended 
that according to their bylaw, collection 
was necessary in order to verify that taxi 
drivers’ income was derived mainly from 
driving a taxicab. The need to collect 
income tax returns, however, for this 
purpose was questionable. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that collection of income 
tax returns was not necessary to the proper 
administration of the licensing of taxicab 
- drivers, and that a form currently in use 
by the Licensing Commission (Declara- 
tion of Affirmation) could serve to pro- 
vide the necessary income information. 


RECOMMENDATIONS 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. Upon receipt of this report, the Li- 
-censing Commission should cease col- 
lection of taxi drivers’ income tax returns, 
_ with the exception of the limited collec- 
_ tion noted below in Recommendation 3. 


2. Upon receipt of this report, the Li- 
censing Commission should return to 
the complainant, all of his income tax 
returns. 


_ 3. The Licensing Commission may wish 
- toconductanauditofno more than 10% 
of all taxi drivers’ Declarations of Affir- 
_ mation filed, for the purpose of verifying 
that the primary income of the drivers is 
’ derived from driving a taxicab. For this 
_ purpose alone, the first page of a driver's 
income tax return and the Statement of 
Income and Expenditure for the Year, if 
filed, may be collected. Drivers included 
_ insuchan audit must be advised that they 
_ may sever all the information from page 
- 1of the return, with the exception of the 


following: name, address, date of birth, 
employer, and those lines related to 
sources of income. On the 1992 Income 
Tax Return, the relevant lines applicable 
to sources of income were lines 101-104, 


and 135-139. 


4. If the Licensing Commission decides 
to conduct an audit as described above, 
then notice of Recommendation 3 and 
the permitted severances to the first page 
of the income tax return should be pro- 
vided to all taxicab drivers.

public record © disclosure 


An individual filed a letter with the Town- 
ship to appeal an amendment toa zoning 
by-law passed by the Township’s Coun- 
cil. Section 34(23) of the Planning Act 
requires the Township to forward that 
appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board 
(OMB). The Township disclosed the 
individual’s letter at a Council meeting, 
before forwarding the letter to the OMB. 
The information in the letter then ap- 
peared in a local newspaper article. The 
individual complained that the letter was 
disclosed by the Township, contrary to 
the Act. 


CONCLUSION | 
The IPC determined that the letter con- 
tained the individual’s personal 
information. The IPC found that the 
individual was aware of the public nature 
of the processes in the Planning Act. The 
IPC found that the OMB files are avail- 
able to the general public, where an order 
has not been made to keep any document 


in the files confidential. 


The IPC concluded that due to the pub- 


lic nature of the planning process and the 


requirement in section 34(23) of the 
Planning Actto forward a notice ofappeal 
to the public OMB file, a letter of appeal 
is information maintained by the Town- 
ship for the purpose of creating a record 
which is available to the general public. 
Accordingly, the individual’s letter of 
appeal was information maintained for 
the purpose of creating a record that was 
available to the general public, and sec- 
tion 27 of the Actapplied. Since section 
27 of the Act applied to the personal 
information, the privacy provisions in 


the Act did not apply.

A former employee of the Police Force 
found out that the Force still had his 
fingerprints and photograph on file, more 
than one year after he had left. He asked 
the IPC if this contravened the Act. 


The complainant also complained to the 
Force, asking them to delete his personal 
records from all data bases and record 
storage. 


CONCLUSION 

Prior to our investigation, the complain- 
ant received a satisfactory response from 
the Police Force concerning the data 
bases and record storage. His one re- 
maining concern was whether the reten- 
tion of his fingerprints and photograph 


on microfilm complied with the Act.

The IPC reviewed the Police Force’s 
retention schedules, and determined that 
retention of the records on microfilm 
complied with Ontario Regulation 517/ 
90 of the Act. The Regulation specifies 
only a minimum retention period, nota 
maximum period.

An individual applied for a job as a 
firefighter with the Municipality. As part 
ofthe recruitment process, the individual 
wrote a test, which asked for the appli- 
cant’s sex, ethnicity, highest grade com- 
pleted and social insurance number (SIN). 
The Municipality’s Fire Chief informed 
the applicants that providing their sex 
and ethnicity was optional and that this 
information would be kept confidential 
and used for statistical purposes only. 
The individual indicated that he was a 


white male. 


The Municipality sent the completed 
test answer sheets to a private company 
for marking. The individual scored 83 
percent. The cut-off mark for white 
males, however, was 85 percent. The 
cut-off mark for females and visible mi- 
norities was 70 percent. 


The individual questioned the Munici- 
pality’s authority to collect and use his sex 
and ethnicity. He also questioned the 
Municipality's authority to disclose his 
sex, ethnicity, grade information and 
SIN to the private company. 


CONCLUSIONS 

The IPC determined that the Munici- 
pality had initially collected the com- 
plainant’s sex and ethnicity information 
on an employment application form, 
and subsequently on the testanswer sheet. 
The IPC found that the Municipality 
had the authority to collect this 
information on the employment appli- 
cation form because the collection was 
“necessary” for the proper administra- 
tion of a lawfully authorized activity, 
namely, a special program under section 
14(1) of the Ontario Human Rights Code. 
However, any subsequent collection of 
this information for the purpose of ad- 


ministering the special program would 
no longer be “necessary” and, therefore, 
would not meet the provisions of section 


28(2) of the Acz. 


The IPC determined that the Munici- 
pality had not satisfied all of the require- 
ments of section 29(2) of the Act, regard- 
ing notice of collection. 


The IPC concluded that the Municipali- 
ty’s use of the complainant's sex and 
ethnicity information was not in compli- 
ance with section 31 of the Act. The IPC 
found that stating that certain data would 
be used for statistical purposes was some- 
thing quite different from stating thatthe 
data would be used statistically to deter- 
mine the number of white male appli- 
cants versus the number of applicants in 
the employment equity target groups 
that would proceed beyond the test, in 
the recruitment process. The IPC found 
that the Municipality’s use of the 
information was not in compliance with 
section 3l(a) of the Act, because the 
complainant could not have consented 
to a use of the information which was 
different from the stated use. The IPC 
also found that the Municipality’s use of 
the information was not in compliance 
with section 31(b) of the Act, because its 
use of the information was for a purpose 
other than the stated purpose or a con- 
sistent purpose. The IPC also found that 
section 31(c) was not applicable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 


The IPC found that the Municipality’s 


disclosure of the applicants’ sex and eth- 


nicity information to the private com- — 


pany for tabulation was for the purpose 


for which it had been obtained or com- — . 


piled — that being, statistical purposes. 
Therefore, the disclosure of this 


information was in accordance with sec- © 


tion 32(c) of the Act. However, the IPC + 


found that the Municipality did not need 


to disclose the SIN and grade information — ‘ 


a

AND PRIVACY

ONTARIO 


of the applicants to generate the statistics 
necessary for its employment equity pro- 
gram. Thus, the Municipality’s disclo- 
sure of this personal information was not 
in compliance with section 32 of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION(S) 
The IPC recommended that the Mu- 
nicipality: 


1. collect personal information only in 
instances where the collection was truly 
“necessary” for the proper administra- 
tion of a lawfully authorized activity; 


2. provide proper notices of collection, 
in accordance with section 29(2) of the 


Act, 


3. use personal information only in ac- 
cordance with section 31 of the Act, 


4. establish a formal written agreement 
with the private company requiring it to 
comply with the applicable privacy pro- 
visions of the Ac¢, since the private com- 
pany was in physical possession of the test 
answer sheets containing the applicants’ 
personal information; 


5. as an alternative to recommendation 
#4, consider removing the personal iden- 
tifiers from the test answer sheets before 
disclosing them to the private company; 
and 


6. notdiscloseany personal information, 
except in accordance with section 32 of 


the Act.

disclosure 


The complainant filed an access request 
for certain records involving the police 
and herself. In the acknowledgement 
letter, the Co-ordinator informed her 
that her name might “be subject to re- 
lease to any person” who was affected by 
her request. She complained that this 
“unwarranted disclosure” to persons out- 
side the FOI and Privacy Unit was a 
violation of her privacy and contrary to 


the Act. 


The Co-ordinator informed the IPC that 
thecomplainant’s access request had been 
disclosed to “only those persons who 
were involved with this incident (and 
their immediate supervisors who are re- 
sponsible to produce the records)” in 
order to respond to the access request. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that it was not nec- 
essary for the Co-ordinator to disclose 
the complainant’s actual access request 
to the police staff involved, and their 


immediate supervisors. 


RECOMMENDATION 

As a result of this investigation, the Co- 
ordinator implemented two changes in 
the manner in which access requests are 
processed: 1) In the letter acknowledg- 
ing receipt of an access request, the Co- 
ordinator no longer states that the re- 
quest may be subject to release to persons 
affected by the request. 2) The Co- 
ordinator no longer distributes a copy of 
the access request. The co-ordinator 
simply advises the Superintendents that 
an access request has been received and 
that certain records are required. 


Since these changes had been imple- 
mented, the IPC did not find it necessary 


to make any recommendations.

collect 


The complainant was the director of a 
child daycare centre that provided daycare 
under a purchase of service contract with 
the Municipality. To renew his contract, 
the complainant was required to submit 
the Revenue Canada taxation slips (T-4 
slips) of his employees as part of his 
budget package. The complainant be- 
lieved that the collection of the T-4 slips 
breached the privacy of his employees, 
because the Municipality did not have 
the legal authority to collect this 
information. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC was advised by the Municipal- 
ity that the submission of T-4 slips was an 
optional method for daycare providers 
who did not submit an audited state- 
ment of staff salaries to verify their em- 
ployees’ wages. 


The IPC found that the Municipality’s 
collection of the T-4 slips was neither 
expressly authorized by statute, used for 
the purposes of law enforcement, nor was 
it necessary for the properadministration 
of a lawfully authorized activity. There- 
fore, the collection was notin accordance 
with section 28(2) of the Acz. 


RECOMMENDATION 


The IPC recommended that the Mu- 
nicipality discontinue collecting employee

process, and the Municipality agreed to 
this. 


However, the Municipality was con- 
cerned that requiring an audited state- 
ment of staff salaries would increase 
daycare centres’ costs. The Municipality 
proposed that it verify T-4 slips and pay 
stubs when it conducted its annual li- 
cense renewal inspection, stating that 
under the purchase of service agreement, 
it had the right to examine the records of 
daycare centres. The IPC recognized 
that the Municipality had an obligation 
to ensure that public funds were being 
spent properly and advised that any veri- 
fication of T-4 slips or pay stubs should 
be carried out in a manner which pro- 
tected the privacy of daycare employees.

disclosure 


The complainant, a former Board em- 
ployee, had previously filed a complaint 
with the IPC concerning, in part, the 
Board's collection of information to sup- 
port his dismissal. Following the investi- 
gation of this complaint, the IPC had 
forwarded a copy of the draft investiga- 
tive report of its findings to both the 
complainant and to the Board for com- 
ments. However, the Board’s legal coun- 
sel had forwarded a copy of the draft 
report with a covering letter toa Worker 
Advisor at the Ministry of Labour and to 
a Re-employment Hearings Officer at 
the Workers’ Compensation Board 


38 


(WCB). The complainant was of the 
view that the Board had improperly dis- 
closed his personal information to these 
two individuals. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the draft report 
together with the covering letter, which 
identified the complainant by name, was 
personal information. 


The IPC determined that the draft report 
was sent to the Worker Advisor and to 
the Re-employment Hearings Officer in 
response to a letter from the Worker 
Advisor. This letter had advised that the 
Worker Advisor intended to object on 
behalf of his client (the complainant) to 
the Board’s proposed introduction, at 
thecomplainant’s WCB Re-employment 
Hearing, of evidence that the Board had 
collected to support his dismissal. The 
Worker Advisor was of the view that the 
Board’s gathering of this information 
had contravened the complainant’s rights 
under the municipal Act. 


The IPC determined that one of the 
purposes for the Board’s collection of the 
draft report (together with the complain- 
ant’s name) had been to resolve the very 
issue of whether the Board’s gathering of 
personal information to establish just 
cause for the complainant’s dismissal had 
been contrary to the Act. (The IPC’s 
draft report found that the collection had 
taken place prior to the Actbeing in force 
and, since there could not have been a 
contravention of the Act.) 


The IPC determined that the Board’s 
subsequent disclosure of the draft report 
to both the Worker Advisor and to the 
Re-employment Hearings Officer was to 
help resolve the issue which the Worker 
Advisor intended to raise before the WCB 
of whether the Board’s original collec- 
tion had been contrary to the Act. 


Thus, the IPC concluded that the disclo- 
sure of the draft report (together with the 
complainant's name) was for a purpose 
for which it had been collected and con- 
sequently was in accordance with section 


32(c) of the Act. 


The IPC, however, commented that the 
Board should have made it clear to the 
Worker Advisor and to the Re-employ- 
ment Hearings Officer that the investi- 
gative report was a draft only, which 
could be altered or amended asa result of 
representations from the Board or the 
complainant.

The complainant, a taxi driver, was con- 
cerned that the Police were collecting 
social insurance numbers (SIN) from 
individuals renewing their taxi driver 
licences, in order to verify their identity. 


CONCLUSION 

Asaresult of the IPC’s contact, the Police 
proposed the following solution. The 
Police would: 


1. modify their forms to exclude the 
collection of the SIN; 


2. modify their procedures to “look but 
not record” the SIN if offered by an 
individual; not ask that the SIN be 
produced as part of the identification 
process; 


3. ensure that the Police service was made 
aware of the rules governing the use and 
collection of the SIN, thus ensuring serv- 
ice-wide complianceconcerning this piece 
of identification. 


The IPC accepted the proposed solution.

The Secretariat received a request for 
access to research documents pertaining 
to the comprehensive land claim made 
by 5,000 Algonquin Indians as well any 
negotiations, policy documents, claims 
issue documents, any written agreements, 
and any written agreement between the 
province and federal government on this 
claim. The Secretariat refused to pro- 
vided access on the basis of sections 13(1), 
17(1), 19,21(3)(d) and (g), 18(1)(d) and 
(e), and 22 of the Act. The Secretariat 
decided to release approximately 1,000 
pages of records to the appellant. The 
Secretariat issued a fee estimate of $1,480 
to apply to documents relating to nego- 
tiation policy and inter-provincial agree- 
ments. During mediation, the appellant 
provided documentation respecting his 
financial status in support of his request 
for a fee waiver. Following a review of 
this information, the Secretariat decided 
not to waive the fee. The appellant 
asserted that there is a public interest in 
the disclosure of all documents that were 
the subject of his request pursuant to 


section 23 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Secretariat was par- 


tially upheld. 


The records at issue consisted of the 
following: a letter compiled by an affect- 
ed person commenting on a researcher’s 
work; a list of researchers with margin 
notes made by the author of the letter 
respecting the suitability of the research- 
ers for certain work; and a report consist- 
ing of research material and margin notes 
made by the author of the letter. 


Section 17 


Scientific information is information be- 
longing to an organized field of knowl- 
edge in either the natural, biological or 
social sciences or mathematics. In addi- 
tion, for information to be characterized 
as scientific, it must relate to the observa- 
tion and testing of specific hypothesis or 
conclusions and be undertaken by an 
expert in the field. Finally, scientific 
information must be given a meaning 
separate from technical information 
which also appears in section 17(1)(a) of 
the Act. The records at issue in this case 
representa collection of historical articles 
with some evaluative comments. They 
neither test a scientific hypothesis, set 
out conclusions based on observations, 
nor present findings according to a speci- 
fic methodology. The records do not 


contain scientific information. 


Technical information is information 
belonging to an organized field ofknowl- 
edge which would fall under the general 
categories of applied sciences or mechani- 
cal arts. Examples of these fields include 
architecture, engineering, or electronics. 
While it is difficult to define technical 
information in a precise fashion, it will 
usually involve information prepared by 
a professional in the field and describe the 
construction, operation or maintenance 
of a structure, process, equipment or 


thing. Based on this definition, the 
Assistant Commissioner found that the 
information contained in the records 
could not reasonably be said to fall into 
the category of technical information. 
Therefore, the records did not qualify for 


exemption under section 17. 


Section 18 


In his examination of the records, the 
Assistant Commissioner did not find any 
information that could be reasonably 
characterized as “positions, plans, proce- 
dures, criteria or instructions”. The Sec- 
retariat neither identified those portions 
of the record which fell into this category, 
nor indicated which information would 
be applied to negotiations. Accordingly, 
the Secretariat has failed to satisfy the 
section 18(1)(e) test and the exemption 
does not apply. The Secretariat has also 
failed to demonstrate a clear, specific and 
understandable linkage between its alle- 
gations of harm under section 8(1)(d) 
and the disclosure of the types of records 
at issue in this appeal. Nor is it evidenton 
the face of the records that the conse- 
quences contemplated by section 8(1)(d) 
could reasonably be expected to result 
from disclosure. Therefore, the records 
do not qualify for exemption under 


8(1)(d) or (e). 


Section 19 


The fact that the material provided by the 
affected person may have subsequently 
been used in helping to structure legal 
advice or in litigation does not alter the 
fact that the records were not prepared 
for such purposes originally. Therefore, 
the records do not qualify for exemption 
under section 19. 


Section 13 


In order to establish that the section 13 ° 
exemption applies to the record, the As- 
sistant Commissioner must first deter- 
mine whether the affected person can be

said to have been “retained” by the Sec- 
retariat. 


While payment of a fee is an important 
indicator in determining whether a for- 
mal engagement of services has occurred, 
it is not determinative. In this case, the 
Secretariat intended to and did retain the 
services of the affected person, notwith- 
standing the absence ofa fee. ‘The Assist- 
ant Commissioner then proceeded to 
determine that some of the records quali- 
fied for exemption under section 13(1). 


Section 22(a) 


The Secretariat had not provided the 
appellant with sufficient information 
which would enable the appellant to 
identify the records in question. Conse- 
quently, the records do not qualify for 
exemption under section 22(a). 


Personal Information 


The namesand addresses of persons iden- 
tified in an employment or professional 
capacity and their apparent business ad- 
dresses do not constitute personal 


information. Addresses which appear to 


be residential rather than employment 
addresses are personal information and 
are properly exempt from disclosure un- 
der section 21(1) of the Act. 


Section 23 


The Assistant Commissioner was not 
convinced that there existed a compel- 
ling public interest in the release of the 
remainder of the records which clearly 
outweighed the purpose of section ]3 
and 21. 


Fee Waiver 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
the Secretariat’s decision not to waive the 
fee of $1,480 was based on fair and 
equitable grounds. However, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner made it clear that his 


decision was based on the somewhat 
unique history of the case. He encour- 
aged the Secretariat to work construc- 
tively with the appellant with respect to 
any subsequent request which he might 
file with the institution.

A request was made to Ontario Hydro 
for access to documents relating to 23 
projects originally considered by staff 
for inclusion in the rehabilitation of the 
Bruce A Nuclear Generating Station and 
which were subsequently excluded from 
that project. Hydro issued an interim de- 
cision in which it proposed to grant partial 


access to the records and provided the 


requester with a fee estimate for search 
time and for preparation of these records. 
The requester sought a fee waiver on the 
basis that dissemination of the records 
would benefit public health or safety 
pursuant to section 57(4)(c) of the Act. 
Hydro decided not to waive the fee. 
During mediation, Hydro reduced its fee 
estimate significantly following final 
confirmation from the appellant that the 
number of records sought had been re- 


duced. 


ORDER 
Ontario Hydro was ordered to waive the 
fee in the appeal and to render a final 


decision on access to the records. 


Hydro raised an issue respecting the stand- 
ard of review under the Actwhich should 
apply in appeals involving an institu- 
tion’s decision to deny a fee waiver. The 
Assistant Commissioner found that the 
standard of review which should apply to 
the review by the Commissioner or his 
delegate to decisions issued under sec- 
tion 57(4) of the Actis one of correctness. 
The phrase “in the head’s opinion” found 
in section 57(4) means only that the 
head of an institution has a duty to de- 


termine whether it is fair and equitable in 
a particular case to waivea fee. The word- 
ing does not affect the Commissioner’s 
statutory authority to review the correct- 
ness of that decision. 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
the following factors are relevant in de- 
termining whether dissemination of a 
record will benefit public health or safety 
under section 57(4) of the Act. 


1. Whether the subject matter of the 
record is a matter of public rather than 
private interest; 


2. Whether the subject matter of the 
record relates directly to a public health 
or safety issue; 


3. Whether dissemination of the record 
would yield a public benefit by (a) dis- 
closing a public health or safety concern 
or (b) contributing meaningfully to the 
development of understanding of an 


important public health or safety issue; 


4. The probability that the requester will 


disseminate the contents of the record. 


The safety of Ontario’s nuclear generat- 
ing facilities is a matter of considerable 
importance to the general public. It is 
clear that the records in question relate 
directly to a public health and safety 
issue. That is, whether the Bruce nuclear 
generating station can continue to be 
operated in the safe manner. It is also 
clear that the debate respecting the safety 
of this facility is complex and that both 
Hydro and various interest groups have 
taken divergent positions on this subject 
which are often difficult for the public to 
reconcile. The records which are the 
subject of this appeal, if disseminated, 
would contribute meaningfully to the 
development of understanding on the 


. subject of the maintenance of aging nu-

representations received from the appel- 
lant, the Assistant Commissioner is satis- 
fied that these records, if they are ulti- 
mately subject to release, will likely be 
disseminated to the public.

The Ministry received a request for access 
to the investigation file relating to a mo- 
tor vehicle accident in which four people 
died. Access was denied in part to 14 
pages pursuant to sections 14(1)(a), 
14(1)(b), 14(1)() and/or section 21 of 
the Act. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


The appellant raised the issue of whether 
the Ministry’s decision letter sufficiently 
described the nature of the severed 
information or explained why certain 
information was severed. 


In the Inquiry Officer’s view, the require- 
ments of section 29 of the Actwere met. 
Although the decision letter did not pro- 
vide general descriptions of the severed 
material, at least partial access was given 


to every page of the record. It was 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


apparent on reviewing the severed ver- 
sion of the record disclosed to the appel- 
lant that the severed portions are, for 
instance, part of a page from a police 
notebook, or a part of a statement given 
to police. Each page partially disclosed to 
the appellant had the severed portions 
clearly marked with the exemption 
claimed noted on the page. The decision 
letter briefly explained why exemptions 
were claimed. The partial disclosure of 
each page made the nature of the 
severances readily apparent, and as a re- 
sult, greater particularity was not neces- 
sary and the requirements of section 29 
had been met. 


The Inquiry Officer went on to find that 
sections 14(1)(a) and 21 exempted the 
records at issue from disclosure. 


The Inquiry Officer also considered the 
application of sections 11(1) and 23 of 
the Act which had been raised bythe 
appellant. 


The Inquiry Officer found that the du- 
ties and responsibilities set out in section 
11 of the Actbelong to the head alone. 
As a result, the Information and Privacy 
Commissioner or his delegate do not 
have the power to make an order pursu- 
ant to section 11 of the Act. 


Section 23 does not apply to exemptions 
from disclosure under section 14. There 
is not a compelling public interest in the 
disclosure of the information which quali- 
fies for exemption under section 21 of the 
Act, in the circumstances of this appeal.

The Ministry received.a request for access 
to all information relating to the pro- 
posed projects known as Transportation 
Place and Ontario International Land 
Port. The Ministry denied access to six 
records in full and 13 records in part 
pursuant to sections 13 and 17 of the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Ministry was par- 
tially upheld. 


The Inquiry Officer found that parts of 
the record qualified for exemption under 
section 13 of the Act. Other portions of 


the record did not qualify as they did not 


° « a » 
contain “advice”. 


The Inquiry Office discussed the mean- 
ing of commercial information found in 
section 17(1) of the Act. Commercial 
information Is information which relates 
solely to the buying, selling or exchange 
of merchandise or services. The term 
“commercial” information can apply to 
both profit-making enterprises and non- 
profit organizations. Consistentwith the 
construction of the various categories of 
information contained in section 17, the 
term “commercial” should be interpreted 
as being distinct from the term “finan- 
cial” or “trade secret”. The Inquiry OF 
ficer then went on to find that the 
information for which section 17 had 
been claimed did not meet part three of 
the three-part test for the application of 
section 17.

The Ministry received six separate requests 
from caregivers employed at Kingston 
Psychiatric Hospital for access to any and 


all information concerning the caregiver 
that may be in the possession of the 


Psychiatric Patient Advocate Office 


(PPAO) at Kingston Psychiatric Hospi- 
tal orat the Provincial Psychiatric Patient 
Advocates Office in Toronto. 


Access to the records in the advocate 
client files was denied on the basis that 
the records were not covered by the Act 
by virtue of the application of section 
65(2)(b). The requesters appealed the 
denial ofaccess. In Interim Order P-374, 
former Assistant Commissioner Tom 
Mitchinson found that the PPAO records 
did not fall within the scope of section 
65(2)(b) and ordered the Ministry to 
provide proper decision letters regarding 
access to each appellant. The Ministry 
subsequently denied access to the records 
on the basis that the PPAO files were not 
within the custody and control of the 
Ministry pursuant to section 10(1) of the 
Act. The records at issue in these appeals 
consist of client contact sheets, memo- 
randa from the patient advocate to staff 
at the facility, internal facility memoranda 
and correspondence. 


ORDER 

The Commissioner found thatthe records 
were in the custody and control of the 
Ministry. 


The PPAO and the Ministry raised the 
concern that by providing copies of the 
records to the Commissioner’s Office, 
they might prejudice their positions that 


_the Ministry does not have custody or 


control of the records. In many situa- 
tions access by the Commissioner’s Of- 
fice to the records at issue in an appeal is 
an integral element of the notion of 
independent review. It would be unfair 
in the circumstances of these appeals, to 
require the production of the records 
from an institution and then use the fact 


_of production, in itself, to refute the 


position advanced on the issue of custody 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


and control. To do so would effectively 
penalize the institution for its coopera- 
tion and could well generate unnecessary 
and unproductive administrative and 
legal wrangling. Therefore, simply pro- 
viding the Commissioners Office with 
a copy of a record does not, in and of 
itself, “prejudice” the position of an insti- 
tution that it does not have custody 
and/or control of that record. 


The Commissioner then went on to 
determine that records maintained by 
the PPAO fall within the overall custody 
and control of the Ministry for the pur- 
poses of the Act. The memorandum of 
understanding between the Ministry and 
PPAO does not indicate that the Minis- 
try has abdicated its authority over the 
PPAO. The memorandum provides 
that the PPAO is responsible for main- 
taining confidential records relating to its 
advocacy operations. This does not mean 
that the PPAO has exclusive custody 
and/or control over records which it has 
been given the responsibility to main- 
tain, to the exclusion of the Ministry, to 
which the PPAO is ultimately account- 
able. 


TheCommissioner found that the records 
each contain the personal information of 
one or more of the appellants and the 
personal information of one or more 
patients. 


One record consisted of the second page 
ofa letter written by an appellant in one 
ofthe appeals. In this letter, the appellant 
mentions the name of a patient. The 
patient’s name has been severed. In the 
Commissioner’s view, no purpose would 
be served by withholding this record 
from its own author and, accordingly, 
he found that this record should be 
disclosed with the name of the patient 
severed. 


The Commissioner found that the re- 
mainder of the records were properly 
exempted from disclosure pursuant to 


section 49(b) of the Act. 


Inits representations the PPAO requested 
that, should the Commissioner consider 
any of the assertions of fact to be dis- 
puted, the PPAO be afforded the oppor- 
tunity to assert them by way of affidavit 
or in a hearing. The procedures for 
processing appeals which have been de- 
veloped by the Commissioner’s Office 
provide that representations are to be 
made in writing. In fact, the PPAO has 
made its representations in writing and 
indicates that it is satisfied with doing so 
provided that the Commissioner accepts 
the assertions of fact and agrees with the 
written arguments. The Commissioner 
was of the view that this is not a situation 
where it would be appropriate to depart 
from the standard procedures for the 
receipt of representations.

The OSC received a request for a copy of 
a current list of market dealers, a current 
list of securities dealers and every “Form 
20” filed with the Ontario Securities 
Commission during 1991 and 1992. 
The OSCacknowledged that the records 
responsive to the request existed but de- 
nied access pursuant to section 22(a) of 
the Act. The OSC advised the requester 
that the records could be obtained by a 
subscription through a private company, 
or at the Metropolitan Toronto Refer- 
ence Library. The requester appealed the 


decision. 


The appellant advised the Appeals Of 
ficer that the records were not available at 
the library. The Appeals Officer verified 
that the “Form 20’s” could be obtained at 
the library and the appellant withdrew 
his appeal as it related to these records. 
The remaining records were not avail- 
able from the library. 


ORDER 
The institution was ordered to disclose 
the records at issue. 


Section 22(a) is unique among the ex- 
emptions contained in Part II of the Act. 
The other exemptions, ifapplicable, per- 
mit an institution to deny access to the 
requested information because of its 
contentor the potential harm that might 
reasonably be expected to result from 
disclosure. Under section 22(a), the 
requested information is not disclosed to 
the requester under the Act because the 
institution claims that it is publicly avail- 
able elsewhere. The section should not 
be applied in a way that could indirectly 
prevent or limit the public access to 
information. Todoso would becontrary 
to the purposes of the Act. Basing an 
individual’s right to access on his or her 
ability to meet conditions for access de- 
termined by a private sector vendor may 
resultin inequitable access to information 
held by government. In the circum- 


INFORMATION

stances of this appeal, although the pri- 
vate sector entity may provide a system of 
access, it does not provide a regularized 
system of access available to the members 
of the public generally. The private 
sector entity is not the equivalent of a 
government publication centre or a 
government run public registry. 


Ina postscript to the order, the Commis- 
sioner commented that he was aware that 
the government is actively looking at the 
information it holds as a potential source 
of non-tax revenue. Although 
information may be “the commodity of 
the 90’s”, a very real question arises as to 
how the governments new initiatives will 
maintain and balance the rights of the 
public to access information for which it 
has already paid with the desire to find 
new sources of revenue. There is a fun- 
damental component of this balancing 
that government sees itself as a custodian 
or trustee of the information it holds. In 
the Commissioner’s view, to create an 
information elite where only those who 
can afford to pay will have access to 
government held information would be 
unacceptable in an open and democratic 
society. 


In some cases government should be able 
to sell the information it holds. There are 
valid reasons for this, both economic and 
otherwise. However, decisions on what 
types of information should be sold must 
always be made against the backdrop that 
members of the general public must con- 
tinue to have a right of access to the 
information held by government.

The Police received a request for all 
information pertaining to a search of a 
person bya police officer ina court room. 
The Police denied access to a document 
entitled “Internal Correspondence” and 
five other pages which are excerpts from 
a police officer’s notebook pursuant to 
section 38(a) and (b), 8(1)(i) and 8(2)(a) 
of the Act. An affected person in the 
appeal raised two additional issues: 
whether the records at issue are subject to 
the Actand; if the Actapplies, whether 
the appellant should be able to obtain 
indirectly information that he would 
be prohibited from obtaining directly. 


ORDER 

The Assistant Commissioner ordered the 
Police to disclose the records to the appel- 
lant. 


The affected person did not refer specifi- 
cally to section 65(3) of the Act, however, 
this section is relevant to the representa- 
tions made by that party. The Assistant 
Commissioner found that the records 
could not be described as notes prepared 
by or fora person presiding in a proceed- 
ing in a court of Ontario, prepared for 
that person’s personal use in connection 
with a proceeding. That was the case 
because the notes had been authored by 
a police officer. The Assistant Commis- 
sioner also noted that, quite apart from 


11 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


this characterization, where notes of this 
nature are provided to the Police, they 
would cease to be employed for the per- 
sonal use of the Judge. Section 137(2) of 
the Courts of Justice Act, which is a confi- 
dentiality provision that overrides the 
application of the provincial Act, is not 
applicable to the facts of this case. 


The affected person submits that, where 
information was originally compiled by 
an individual presiding over a hearing 
and then shared with the Police, it would 
be wrong for an appellant to obtain this 
material from an alternative collateral 
source, namely the Police. Since the 
party's representations did not indicate 
that a presiding Judge actually authored 
any of the written notes, the Assistant 
Commissioner did not accept this argu- 
ment. 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
concerns expressed by an affected person 
in her official capacity did not qualify as 
that person’s personal information for 
the purposes of the Act. Therefore, the 
records at issue contained the personal 
information of the appellant only and 


section 38(b) does not apply. 


Section 8(1)(i) does not apply because 
the records at issue relate to an incident 
which occurred in a court room over a 
yearago. Disclosure ofinformation which 
would reveal the assignment of a particu- 
lar police officer to an area of a facility 
over a year ago could not reasonably be 
expected to endanger the security of the 
building now or in the future. Section 
8(2)(a) does not apply because neither 
the internal correspondence nor the po- 
lice officer’s notes meet the definition of 
areport. Because neither the exemptions 
in sections 8(1)(i) or 8(2)(a) of the Act 
apply to the record, it was not necessary 
for the Assistant Commissioner to con- 
sider the application of section 38(a).

The Police received a request for access to 
all of the requester’s information filed at 
number 14 Division. The Police indi- 
cated that the requester advised them that 
he was seeking information concerning 
his September 1991 arrest for a posses- 
sion of marijuana. 


In his letter ofappeal, the appellant stated 
that he now wanted all of his personal 
information dating back to 1974 in the 
custody or control of the Police. The 
Appeals Officer advised the appellant 
that the appeal related only to his original 


request regarding his arrest in 1991. 


The Police granted access to some of the 
records and denied access to.others, ei- 
ther in whole or in part pursuant to 
sections 38(a), 38(b), 8(1)(d) and (e), 
8(2)(a), 9(1)(d) and 14 of the Act. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Police was partially 
upheld. 


The Inquiry Officer found that some 
parts of the record did not contain per- 
sonal information because the info- 


rmation in these pages was provided by 
individuals in their professional capac- 
ity or in execution of their employment 
responsibilities. He found that other 
pages contained personal information 
which related solely to the appellant 
while other information consisted of 
the personal information which related 


to individuals other than the appellant. 


Two pages of the record are computer 
printouts, containing the criminal his- 
tory of the appellant. The Police state 
that this information was received from 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
(the RCMP) and that therefore section 
OCI) d) oF the Act-appliess Ine 
information on these two pages was elec- 
tronically retrieved from the Canadian 
Police Information Centre (CPIC), a 
computerized information system with 
databases to which law enforcement 
agencies supply information and from 
which they can obtain a wide range of 
information. The information in CPIC 
is comprised of information originally 
entered in the system by various law 
enforcement agenices, including non- 
federal sources. 


The Inquiry Officer found that the Po- 
lice had not provided him with any evi- 
dence that the information in the two 
pages was supplied to CPIC by the 
RCMP. Based on the examination of the 
record, it appeared that the information 
was originally supplied to CPIC by the 
Police themselves. Therefore, he was 
unable to conclude that the information 
on the two pages was received by the 
Police from the RCMP. Accordingly he 
found that the records do not qualify for 
exemption under section 9(1)(d) of the 
Act. Because section 9(1)(d) did not 
apply, the records could not qualify for 


exemption under section 38(a). 


The Inquiry Officer then went on to find 
that section 14 applied to the personal

The Region received a request for access 
to any personnel records pertaining to 
the requester’s unsuccessful application 
for a nursing aid position with the Re- 
gion. One record remains at issue. It is 
entitled “Reference Inquiry” and was 
exempted by the institution pursuant to 
section 38(c) of the Act. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Region was partially 
upheld. 


The record at issue contained personal - 


information of the appellant only. In his 
decision, Assistant Commissioner 
Glasberg pointed out that section 38(c) 
of the Act attempts to address two com- 
peting interests. These are: (1) the right 
of an individual to have access to his or 
her personal information and (2) the 
need to protect the flow of frank 
information to provincial or municipal 
institutions so that appropriate decisions 
can be made respecting the awarding of 
jobs, contracts or other benefits. He then 
elaborated on the third part of the three 
part test already established for the appli- 
cation of section 49(c) (the provincial 
equivalent of section 38(c) of the munici- 
pal Acz). An institution must establish 
that: (a) the information was supplied to 
the institution in circumstances where it 
may reasonably have been assumed that 
the identity of the source would be held 
in confidence and (b) the disclosure of 
the record would reveal the identity of 
the source of the information. 


The Assistant Commissioner also set out 
anumber of factors which are relevant in 
deciding whether the third part of the test 
has been satisfied. These factors are: (1) 
the expectations of the provider of the 
reference regarding confidentiality; (2) 


the ordinary practice and/or experience 
of the individual who provided the refer- 
ence and of the institution which sought 
the reference with respect to confidenti- 
ality; (3) the knowledge of the individual 
about whom the information relates as to 
the identity of the provider of the refer- 
ence; and (4) the nature of the reference 
information itself insofar as it would 
identify the provider of the information. 


After reviewing the record, the Assistant 
Commissioner found that some por- 
tions of the record would identify the 
source of the information. Only those 
portions met all three parts of the test for 
exemption under section 38(c).

The Town received a request for 


information relating to complaints re- . 


ceived by the Town about the requester’s 
property. The Town identifieda number 
of records which were responsive to the 
request. The Town granted access to 
these records in full except for one record 
which was released with some information 
withheld pursuant to section 8(1)(d) of 
the Act. The record at issue is a one-page 
handwritten internal memorandum. The 
portion of the record which was withheld 
contained the name of the member of 
council who received complaints about 


the appellant’s property. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Town was upheld. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg was 
satisfied that the Town’s by-law enforce- 
ment process qualified as law enforce- 
ment under the Act. Further, on the facts 
of the case, he found that the councillor, 
although he/she received information 
from other individuals about the re- 
quester, was the actual source of the 
complaint provided to the Town. Based 
on the wording of section 8(1)(d), Assist- 
ant Commissioner Glasberg accepted 
that aconfidential source of information 
could include a municipal councillor. 


The final step in the analysis was to 
determine whether the release of the 
counsellors name would disclose the 
identity of a confidential source of 
information. In order to establish that a 


source is confidential, a municipality must 
provide evidence of the circumstances in 
which the evidence was given. More 
particularly, the municipality must dem- 
onstrate that there was a reasonable ex- 
pectation of confidentiality associated 
with the by-law enforcement process. 
Based principally on the Town’s stated 
policy of protecting the names of com- 
plainants in by-law enforcement cases, 
including members of council, the As- 
sistant Commissioner found that when 
the councillor provided the information 
to Town officials, there was a reasonable 
expectation that the councillor’s identity 


would be kept confidential.

The Board received a request for an audit 
that looked into the Board’s operations. 
The requester provided the Board with a 
vendor account number through which 
the Board allegedly paid the accounting 
firm which conducted the audit, the 
name of a Board employee who was 
allegedly interviewed by a member of the 
accounting firm and details as to when 
the audit was performed. The appellant 
believed that the accounting firm held a 
duplicate copy of the audit report. The 
Board responded that the record, if it 
exists, is not within the Board’s custody. 


ORDER 
The Board was ordered to conduct a 
further search for the responsive record 


and to notify the appellant by letter as to 
the results within 15 days of the date of 
the order. 


The Act does not require the Board to 
prove with absolute certainty that the 
requested record does not exist, however, 
in order to properly discharge its obliga- 
tions under section 17(1) of the Acz, the 
Board must provide sufficient evidence 
that it has made a reasonable effort to 
identify and locate records responsive to 
the request. Itappeared from the Board’s 
representations that there was no search 
conducted to locate the requested records 
since the Board’s position is that the 
record was never created. The Board’s 
representations did not indicate that a 
named member or any other person in 
the accounting firm was consulted dur- 
ing the processing of the appellant’s re- 
quest. In addition, the Board has pro- 
vided no evidence to enable the Inquiry 
Officer to conclude that the Board em- 
ployee who was consulted would have 
any knowledge of or understanding of 
the subject matter of the request. ‘There- 
fore, it was the Inquiry Officer’s opinion 
that the Board had not provided suffi- 
cient evidence to enable him to conclude 
that it had discharged its statutory obliga- 
tion to conduct a reasonable search for 
records responsive to the request.

The Board received a request to examine 
the expense accounts from 1987 to the 
date of the request (May 27, 1991) for 
five named individuals, including actual 
receipts, invoices, phone bills and other 
supporting documents. The Board ad- 
vised that it does not keep statements of 
expense accounts in the manner requested 
by the appellant but suggested that it 
could produce computer printouts for 
each of the named individuals detailing 
the date and amount of each cheque 
made out to them as reimbursement for 
expenses. The appellant, however, de- 
clined to narrow her request and wanted 
to examine each expense claim and all the 
supporting documentation submitted by 
the individuals for the time period speci- 
fied. 


The Board issued an interim decision 
and a fee estimate. The decision indi- 
cated that access would: not be given to 
parts of the record which contained per- 
sonal information of individuals pursu- 
ant to section 14 of the Act. The appel- 


lant appealed the fee estimate and re- 
quested that the Board waive the fee. The 
Board denied the request. The appellant 
appealed the decision not to waive the 
fee. 


ORDER 
The Inquiry Officer upheld the Board’s 


decision not to waive the fee. 


The appellant claims that no charges for 
a fee can be levied under the Act in the 
circumstances of her request because sec- 
tion 207(4) of the Education Act make 
specific provision for the collection of a 
fee for access to records of the nature of 
those she has requested. 


The appellant claimed that receipts and 
other documents supporting an expense 
account qualify as “current accounts”. 


Receipts, invoices and other documents 
tendered as evidence of money received 
or expended would not be included in 
the term “current accounts’, for the pur- 
poses of section 207(4) of the Education 
Act. The term “current account” would 
refer to a statement of debits and credits. 
This statement would refer to the current 
fiscal year, and would be distinct from 
theaudited annual financial reports which 
would refer to past fiscal years. Section 
207(4) of the Education Act does not 
provide for a charge or fee for the types of 
records requested by the appellant. There- 
fore, the fee provisions of the Actapply in 
the circumstances of the appeal. 


The Inquiry Officer then went on to 
determine whether the Board’s decision 
not to waive a fee was in accordance with 
the terms of the Act. 


It would not be fair and equitable to 
waive the fee in the circumstances of this 
appeal. In coming to this conclusion, the 
Inquiry Officer considered the manner 
in which the Board attempted to respond

to theappellant’s request; the fact that the 
request involves a very large volume of 
records; that the appellant was not pre- 
pared to narrow her request but insisted 
on receiving raw data which requires 
extensive searches and time consuming 
severance procedure; that the appellant 
has not advanced a compromised solu- 
tion which would reduce the cost; that 
the actual cost of producing the record 
exceeds the fee itself and that waiving of 
the fee would shift an unreasonable bur- 
den of the cost of access from the appel- 
lant to the Board, resulting in significant 
interference with the operations of the 
Board.

The Police received a request for access to 
reports and statements pertaining to a 
fire which occurred at a particular time 
and place in the City of London. The 
Police notified five individuals named in 
the records and invited them to submit 
their views regarding disclosure of the 
records. 


The Police granted partial access to the 
records but withheld certain parts pursu- 
ant to sections 8(1)(L), 8(2)(a) and 38(b) 
of the Act. During mediation, the re- 
quest was narrowed to four witness state- 
ments and the statement of the investi- 
gating officer. 


On June 30, 1993 while the representa- 
tions were being considered, the Ontario 
Court (General Division) (Divisional 
Court) issued its decision in the case of 
John Doe etal. v. Information and Privacy 
Commussioner et al. (unreported). This 
decision interpreted several provisions of 
the provincial Actin a way which differed 


from the interpretation developed in or- 
ders of the Commissioner. Since similar 
statutory provisions were also at issue in 
the present appeal, it was determined 
that copies of the Divisional Court deci- 
sion should be provided to the parties 
along witha statement that the Commis- 
sioner’s Office planned to follow the 
interpretation established by the Court. 
The appellant and the Police were pro- 
vided with the opportunity to change or 
to supplement the representations which 
they had previously submitted. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Police was upheld. 


Some portions of the record contained 
personal information which relates solely 
to individuals other than the appellant. 
Other information relates both to the 
appellant and other identifiable indivi- 


duals. 


Section 14 


The Commissioner found that the records 
are not currently maintained in a pub- 
licly available form and therefore section 
14(1)(c) does not apply. The Commis- 
sioner then went on toe consider the 
application of section 14(1)(f) in light of 
the Divisional Court decision. 


The Divisional Court, addressed the 
question of the inter-relationship between 
sections 21(2), (3) and (4) of the provin- 
cial Freedom of Information and Protec- 
tion of Privacy Act. These provisions are 
similar to sections 14(2), (3) and (4) of 
the municipal Act. The court found that 
where personal information falls within 
one of the presumptions found in the 
equivalent of section 14(3) of the mu- 
nicipal Act, a combination of circum- 
stances set out in section 14(2) of the Act 
which weigh in favour of disclosure can- 
not collectively operate to rebut the pre- 
sumption. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The only way in which a section 14(3) 
presumption can be overcome is if the 
personal information at issue falls under 
section 14(4) of the Actor where a find- 
ing is made under section 16 of the Act 
that a compelling public interest exists in 
the disclosure of the record in which the 
personal information is contained, which 
clearly outweighs the purpose of the sec- 
tion 14 exemption. The Commissioner 
adopted the court’s reasoning for the 


purposes of the order. 


The Commissioner found that the pre- 
sumption contained in section 14(3)(b) 
of the Act applied and that disclosure of 
the information would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of the personal pri- 
vacy of other individuals. The Commis- 
sioner considered section 14(4) of the Act 
and found that none of the personal 
information at issue falls within this pro- 
vision. The appellant in this case did not 
argue that the public interest override set 
out in section 16 of the Act applied. 
Therefore, the Commissioner found that 
the information which related solely to 


other individuals should not be disclosed. 


The Commissioner also found that por- 
tions of the record which contained the 
personal information of the appellant 
and other individuals should not be dis- 
closed pursuant to section 38(b) of the 
Act.

KEYWORDS 


disclose * security 


An employee of the Ministry was work- 
ing undera Memorandum of Agreement 
between herself and the Ministry. The 
employee complained that the Ministry 
distributed copies of the Agreement and 
medical certificates to the staff of the 
department at the Psychiatric Hospital 
where she was assigned to work. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the Agreement and 
the medical certificates were disclosed to 
departmentsupervisors. The Agreement 
alone was disclosed to the hospital staff. 
The Ministry submitted that section 42(b) 
applied because the complainant had 
verbally consented to the disclosure for 
educational purposes. The IPC found 
that the employee had not identified the 
Agreement and medical certificates “in 
particular”, or consented to their disclo- 
sure; thus, section 42(b) of the Actdid not 


apply. 


The IPC also found that since the em- 
ployee’s union representative had picked 
up the Agreement and the medical cer- 
tificates from a desk in the department's 
main office, the employee’s personal 
information was easily accessible to him 
or any other individual in the main office 


of the department. Therefore, the IPC 
was of the view that reasonable measures 
to prevent unauthorized access to the 
complainant’s personal information were 
not in effect, in accordance with section 


-4(1) of Ontario Regulation 460. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. when the Ministry relies upon an 
individual’s consent, it ensures that the 
personal information to be disclosed has 
been identified “in particular” by the 


individual; 


2. the Ministry ensure that all staff and 
supervisors of the Psychiatric Hospital be 
reminded of the limited purposes for 
which the disclosure of personal 
information is permitted under section 


42 of the Act; 


3. the Ministry ensure that its polices 
and procedures comply with the require- 
ments of section 4(1) of Ontario Regula- 
tion 460.

nated for behaviour incompatible with - 
his employment. 


The complainant believed that the dis- 
closure by the OPP officer of his arrest 
and pending charges to his employer was 
not in accordance with the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

It was the Ministry’s view that section 37 
of the Act applied since the information 
disclosed was soon to be made available 
publicly and thus, the disclosure provi- 
sions of Part III of the Act were not 
applicable. 


However, it was the IPC’s view that at the 
time of the disclosure, it could not be said 
that the OPP was maintaining the per- 
sonal information for the purpose of 
creating a record available to the public: 
the charges against the complainant had 
not yet been laid; documents compelling 
a court appearance had not been signed; 
and “an information” had not been laid 
in court. Therefore, it was the IPC’s view 
that section 37 of the Act was not appli- 
cable to the personal information dis- 
closed by the OPP and that the disclosure 
provisons did apply. 


PAI 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The Ministry submitted that the disclo- 
sure would have been in accordance with 
section 42(a) of the Act since it would 
have been in ‘compliance with part II 
(sections 21(1)(c),21(1)(f) and 21(2)(b)). 
The Ministry also submitted that under 
section 63(1) the disclosure would have 
been permitted in the absence of an 
access request under the Act. 


However, it was the IPC’s view that 
section 42(a) could only be relied upon in 
the context of an access request. Since 
section 63(1) did not refer specifically to 
“personal information”, and since one of 
the purposes of the Act is to protect the 
privacy of individuals, it was the IPC’s 
view that section 63(1) needed to be 
interpreted narrowly. 


With respect to Section 63(1), it was our 
view that there would have existed a 
presumed invasion of personal privacy 
under section 21(3) in part II since the 
information about the complainant’s ar- 
rest and charges could be said to have 
been “compiled and is identifiable as part 
of an investigation into a possible viola- 
tion of law”. Therefore, notice as re- 
quired by section 28(1) should have been 
provided. Since notice had not been 
provided by the OPP in accordance with 
section 28(1), the disclosure would not 
have been in accordance with part II and, 
thus, would not have been in compliance 
with section 42(a). 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try take steps to ensure that in future, 
disclosures of personal information by 
the OPP be made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act, as intepreted in this 
investigation.

that her manager had disclosed the 
amount of her award to her co-workers. 
The individual subsequently fileda griev- 


ance. 


Soon after filing her grievance, the indivi- 
dual received an apology from her man- 
ager. Because the individual was con- 
cerned that her manager might breach

her privacy again when she received an 
expected second award from the WCB, 
the individual requested the IPC to en- 
sure that her manager and all other em- 
ployees of the facility receive training in 
freedom of information and the protec- 
tion of privacy. The IPC contacted the 
Ministry in this regard, and it agreed to 
provide the requested training. 


Although the individual received an apol- 
ogy from her manager, the grievance 
nonetheless proceeded to stage II. The 
individual believed that during a stage I] 
meeting, the amount of her award had 
been improperly disclosed to the person 
designated to decide the grievance. 


Unrelated to her WCB award and her 
subsequent grievance, the individual ap- 
plied for a vacancy at the facility. Only 
one other employee had also applied for 
this vacancy. The complainant was not 
thesuccessful candidate. Sometime later, 
the successful candidate prepared a video 
for the young offenders at the facility. 
The video included a scene in which the 
complainant believed that she had been 
depicted as the unsuccessful candidate in 
the job competition, which she believed 
was an improper use of her personal 
information. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the amount of the 
complainant's WCB award was personal 
information, in accordance with para- 
graph (b) of the definition of personal 


information in section 2(1) of the Act. 


_ The IPC was unable to determine how 
the decision-maker at the stage II griev- 
ance meeting had come to learn the 
amount of the WCB award. The IPC 
determined that had the amount of the 
award been disclosed to the decision- 
maker by a Ministry employee in attend- 
anceat this meeting, the disclosure would 
not have been in accordance with section 


42(d) of the Act, because the decision- 
maker would not have “needed” to know 
the value of the award to decide the 
grievance. The IPC found that none of 
the remaining exceptions to section 42 
would have applied to this disclosure of 


personal information. 


The IPC found that while the complain- 
ant had not been identified by name in 
the video, she was nonetheless “identifi- 
able”. The IPC thus found that the video 
contained the complainant’s personal 
information, in accordance with para- 
graph (b) of the definition of personal 


information, in section 2(1) of the Act. 


The IPC determined that the Ministry’s 
use of this personal information was not 
in accordance with section 41 of the Act. 
We also learned that the video had been 
confiscated by the Ministry’s legal de- 
partment, for reasons unrelated to this 
privacy complaint. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try take steps to ensure that personal 
information in its custody or under its 
control be used only in accordance with 
section 41.

istry’s position was that the use of the 
stamp was necessary in order to ensure 
that any misdirected mail was returned 
directly to the Family Support Plan of- 
fice, thus eliminating the need for mail- 
room staff to open returned envelopes in 
order to re-direct them to the appropriate 
office. When a letter was returned, as a

Support Plan staff would investigate fur- 
ther to determine if the mailing address 
in the system was obsolete. 


The IPC suggested a solution that was 
acceptable to both parties to the investi- 
gation, namely, that a new plate for the 
office stamp machine be ordered bearing 
the initials “F.S.P.” so that in future 
envelopes would be stamped with these 
initials rather than “Family Support Plan”.

24 : 


A transit authority had reviewed its em- 
ployee performance files, and destroyed 
all minor disciplinary entries prior to a 
particular period of time, further to its 
collective agreement with the union. An 
employee of the transit authority ques- 
tioned whether the transit authority had 
disposed of these records in accordance 


with the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the records in ques- 
tion were outside the jurisdiction of the 
Act. In Order M-160, Commissioner 
Tom Wright noted that as a result of the 
principle of “interjurisdictional immu- 
nity’, there were some limits on the 
application of the Act to the transit au- 
thority. The Commissioner noted that 
because the labour relations component 
of the transit authority was governed by 
federal law and since grievances were a 
part of labour relations, a provincial Act, 
such as the Municipal Freedom of 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 
would not apply to records relating to 
grievances. 


In this case, the minor disciplinary en- 
tries were disposed of further to the agree- 
ment between the transit authority and 
the union. Since collective agreements 
clearly relate to labour relations, the IPC 
concluded that the records in question 
were outside the jurisdiction of the Act.

An employee of the Police Force com-

had been disclosed out of his police file. 
Thecomplainantand two other auxiliary 
constables had written a test while on an

there were no other disclosures of the test 
results, although a disclosure may have 
been made by the other two candidates 
who were present when the test results 
were released. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that since the com- 
plainant did not consent to this method 
of releasing his test results, and since none 
of the provisions which permit disclosure 
applied in this case, such a disclosure 


contravened section 32 of Part II of the

The complainant was a member of the

at a fire scene, a complaint was filed by a

complainant as having been involved in 


the incident. The media obtained the 


information in the investigation report

AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/

and printed itin a newspaper article. The 
complainantsubmitted that the City had 
disclosed the report, contrary to the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that none of the indivi- 
duals identified as having access to the 
report, acknowledged disclosing the re- 
port or the information it contained to 
the media. Therefore, the IPC was un- 
able to establish conclusively if the City 


had in fact made the disclosure. 


However, the IPC examined the provi- 
sions of section 32 of the Actand found 
that, if the City had disclosed the report 
to the media, the disclosure would not 
have been in accordance with section 32. 


RECOMMENDATION 

Although unable to determine if the City 
had disclosed the report to the media, the 
IPC recommended that the City take 
steps to ensure that it clearly communi- 
cates to those who have access to the 
investigation reports, that they must re- 
main confidential, and that any disclo- 
sure of personal information be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Act. The IPC recommended that this 
should be reflected in the City’s proce- 


dures for conducting such investigations. 


The City responded by clearly indicating 
its willingness to comply with the recom- 
mendation, and proposed a number of 
changes. The IPC was satisfied with the 
City’s comprehensive response to the 
recommendation.

* reference * use * public record 


A teacher was assigned to various short- 
term occasional teaching assignments by 
the Board over a period of two years. He 
then applied for a long-term position, 
and was the successful candidate. While 
conducting reference checks, the Board’s 
Staffing Superintendent spoke with an 
employee of another board, who was not 
one of the teacher’s referees. She found 
that the teacher had been terminated by 
that board for unsatisfactory perform- 
ance and that an arbitration decision was 
available. 


As an extension of its reference checking 
process, the Board obtained a copy of the 
arbitration decision, which was available 
to the general public through the Educa- 
tion Relations Commission. Subse- 
quently, the Board terminated the teach- 
er’s long-term contract, and removed his 
name from its occasional teacher list, 
thereby terminating his employment. 
The teacher believed that the collection 
and use of the information in the arbitra- 
tion decision had breached his privacy. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the arbitration deci- 
sion contained the complainant’s “per- 
sonal information”, as defined in section 
2(1) of the Act. Since the Board did not 
maintain the personal information for 
the purpose of creating a record available 
to the general public, the Board could 
not rely on section 27 of the Act to 
exempt the record of the arbitration de- 
cision from the privacy provisions of the 


Act. 


The personal information was collected 
in accordance with section 28(2) of the 
Act, since the collection of reference 
information was necessary to the proper 


administration of the Board’s lawfully 


authorized activity of appoint qualified 


teachers for its schools. 


The personal information was collected 
indirectly by the Board, in accordance 
with section 29(1) of the Act, since the 
disclosure by the Education Relations 
Commission could not contravene the 
restrictions on disclosure in section 42 of 


the provincial Act. 


The Board had not provided proper 
notice for the collection of the personal 
information, in accordance with section 
29(2) of the Act, because its notice did 
not contain all the elements set out in 
section 29(2). 


Use 1: (terminating the long-term con- 
tract) The IPC found that the personal 
information had been used for the pur- 
pose for which it was obtained (the job 
competition), inaccordance with section 


31(b) of the Act. 


Use 2: (removing the teacher's name 
from the occasional teacher list) Since the 
personal information was collected indi- 
rectly, the IPC’s view was that determin- 
ing whether the personal information 
had been used for a consistent purpose 
should be determined by considering 
whether the use of the personal 
information was reasonably compatible 
with the purpose for which it was col- 
lected. 


The IPC concluded that using the per- 
sonal information to remove the teach- 
er’s name from the occasional teacher list 
was not reasonably compatible with the 
purpose for which it was collected. The 
Board’s notice to applicants had stated 
that the personal information would be 
used for the purpose of the long-term 
competition only [emphasis added]. 


Since the use of the personal information 
was not reasonably compatible with the 


25:

purpose for which it was collected, the 
personal information was not used in 
accordance with section 31(b) of the Act 
when it was used to remove the com- 
plainant’s name from the occasional 
teacher list. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Board 
incorporate the following points into its 
procedures: 


1. provide proper notice for collection of 
personal information for job competi- 
tions and reference checks; 


2. provide proper notice for collection of 
personal information from public records; 


3. obtain written authorization from can- 
didates to contact referees; and 


4. restrict collection of personal 
information to referees the Board has 
been authorized to contact.

disclose * access request 


An individual filed a complaint with the 
Police Service's internal investigation unit 
which handles public complaints against 
police personnel. During the investiga- 
tion of her complaint, the complainant 
was interviewed by two investigating of- 
ficers who were aware that she had filed 
a request with the police for access to 
information under the Act. The com- 
plainantstated that this information must 


26 


have been disclosed by the two officers, 
contrary to the Act. In addition, the 
complainant knew that five individuals 
with the Police had received a copy of her 
access request. The complainant stated 
that these five individuals disclosed her 
personal information to other indivi- 
duals, either within or outside of the 
Police, contrary to the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the access request 
itself had not been disclosed to the inves- 
tigating officers. The two investigating 
officers had learned about the complain- 
ant’s access request after their discussion 
with her during the interview, and after 
considering the material she had filed 
with her complaint to the Police. 


The IPC found that the two investigat- 
ing officers had disclosed the fact that the 
complainant had filed an access request, 
but not the details of the request, to their 
direct Supervisor. The IPC concluded 
that the disclosure was necessary and 
proper in the discharge of the Police’s 
function of investigating public com- 
plaints against police personnel. The 
[PC concluded thatthe Supervisor needed 
the information in the performance of 
his duty of ensuring the thorough inves- 
tigation of these complaints. Therefore, 
the IPC concluded that the disclosure 
was in accordance with section 32(d) of 


the Act. 


The IPC found that, of the five indivi- 
duals identified who had recieved a copy 
of the complainant’s access request, one 
individual had disclosed it to a Police 
Inspector. The Inspector had then dis- 
closed it to the person under his supervi- 
sion, who was one of the five identified. 
The IPC concluded this disclosure was 
contrary to the Act, since none of the 
provisions of section 32 applied. 


RECOMMENDATION 

Prior to the IPC’s investigation of this 
matter, the Police implemented changes 
in the manner in which they processed 
access requests. Accordingly, the IPC did 
not find it necessary to make a recom- 
mendation regarding this disclosure.

disclose * consistent 


The complainant, a Home Child Care 
Provider, was concerned that the Mu- 
nicipality was providing parents with a 
copy of a bi-weekly Home Child Care 
Attendance Register form which included 
her name, address, telephone number, 
her provider’s code number and signa- 
ture. The complainant was also con- 
cerned that there were no policies in place 
to keep this personal information confi- 
dential when it was in the custody of the 
parents. 


CONCLUSION 

1. With respect to the disclosure of the 
provider’s name and signature on the 
parent’s copy of the form, we found that 
the disclosure of this information was for 
a consistent purpose and therefore in 
accordance with section 32(c) of the Act. 
The Municipality had collected the 
information on the form asa verification 
of child care services provided and had 
disclosed the information as a signed 
receipt for the parents for these same 
services. The provider might reasonably 
expect such a disclosure. 


2. With respect to the disclosure of the 
provider's address and telephone number, 
we found that the initial disclosure of this 
information was for aconsistent purpose 
in accordance with section 32(c) of the 
Act. The Municipality had collected this 
information as part of the enrollment 
processand had disclosed the information 
so that parents would be able to take their 
children to the provider’s home and con- 
tact them as necessary. However, it was 
our view that once parents had received 
this information, it did not need to be 


subsequently included on the parent’s 
copy of the form, each time that services 
were provided. 


3. With respect to the disclosure of the 
provider’s code number, we did not find 
this disclosure to be in accordance with 
the Act. The Municipality acknowl- 
edged this and informed the IPC that 
when the form was next printed, the code 
would no longer appear on the parent’s 
copy. Until that time, providers would 
be instructed to sever the code number or 
complete the form in a such a manner 
that the code did not appear on the 


parent's copy. 


4, With respect to the complainant’s 
concerns about the confidentiality of her 
personal information when it was in the 
hands of the parents, the Municipality 
advised that it would contact both pro- 
viders and parents to outline its concerns 
about the inappropriate handling of the 
form, and to recommend to them, spe- 
cific steps to be taken to reduce the 
possibility of subsequent disclosure. 


RECOMMENDATION 

We recommended that the Municipality 
also remove the provider’s address and 
telephonenumber from the parent’s copy, 
when the form was next reprinted.

A request was made for access to a copy 
of a petition submitted to the Ministry 
under section 178 of the Municipal Act 
requesting an inquiry into the adminis- 
tration of Arthur Township (the Town- 
ship). 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 
record. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The record at issue was a petition sub- 
mitted to the Minister of Municipal 
Affairs under the provisions of section 
178 of the Municipal Actwhich provides 
that “the Lieutenant Governor in Coun- 
cil, upon the recommendation of the 
Minister, may issue a commission to 
inquire into any of the affairs of any 
municipality ... ”. The section further 
provides that a commission may be re- 
commended “... upon the request in writ- 
ing ... of not less than fifty electors of the 
municipality.” 


Inquiry Officer Seife was of the view that 
although not listed under section 21 (2), 
the public nature of the record at issue 
was a relevant consideration in the cir- 
cumstances of this appeal and that this 
unlisted factor favoured the disclosure of 
the record. 


Inquiry Officer Seife referred to Order 
171, in which former Inquiry Officer 
McCamus stated: 


Petitions by their very nature, are not 
documents that have an aura of confiden- 
tiality. The signatories to a petition do so 
voluntarily. By including their name on a 
petition, a signatory takes a public stand 
with respect to the issue being petitioned 
for. Petitioners are aware that they are re- 
vealing personal information about them- 
selves when they add their names to a 
petition. They also realize that the petition 
will be circulated and used in whatever 
manner ts necessary in order to further the 
cause which is the subject of the petition. 


Further, petitions are usually collected in a 
fairly public manner. Proponents of a peti- 
tion often seek additional signatories in 
shopping malls, in front of public buildings 
or in door to door campaigns. Individuals 
are approached to add their names to the 
petition and are given the opportunity to 
read the body of the petition. Upon doing 


so, the individual, who may or may not 
eventually become a signatory, will have 
the opportunity to see the names, addresses 
and signatures of those who have already 
lent their support to the petition. 


Inquiry Officer Seife found that while 
there may be cases where, due to the 
sensitivity of their content, petitions may 
be circulated in secrecy and supplied to 
an institution in confidence, this was not 
the case in the circumstances of this 
appeal. The individuals who signed the 
petition were exercising their right un- 
der the Municipal Act to request the 
appointment of a commission of in- 
quiry, a public process governed by the 
Public Inquiries Act. Under these cir- 
cumstances, it was not reasonable to 
expect that the petitioners identities 


would be kept confidential.

A request was made for access to “the 
names of the persons [who filed the 
complaints], and the dates of these men- 
tioned complaints, also the complaint 
and the date of such incident.” 


ORDER 
The Secretariat was ordered to disclose 
the records at issue with some severances. 


Inquiry Officer Seife found that when an 
allegation of sexual harassment is made 
and investigated, it is reasonable for the 
parties involved to find the experience 
distressing and to restrict discussion of 
the subject with others. However, this 
would not be the case as between the 
complainant and the respondent (in this 
case the affected persons and the appel- 
lant). Owing to the nature of the com- 
plaint of sexual harassment itself, it is 
neither possible nor practical for the in- 
vestigation of the complaint to proceed 
in circumstances where the identity of 
the complainant and the substance of 
the complaint are withheld from the 
respondent. 


Once a formal complaint of sexual har- 
assment has been filed and a decision is 
made to investigate the complaint, con- 
fidentiality of information received dur- 
ing this process must be maintained to 
protect the personal privacy of the indi- 
vidual’s involved; however, this protec- 
tion does not extend to withholding 
from the respondent such vital 
information as the identity of the com- 
plainant and the substance of the com- 
plaint. Given the nature of the complaint 
of sexual harassment, it is not reasonable 
for the complainants to expect that such 
information would not be disclosed to 
the respondent, nor is it possible or even 
practical for the investigating institution 
to guarantee that the information would 
not be disclosed to the very person whose 
response to the complaintis being sought. 


Section 49(b) allows the withholding of 
personal information that relates to the 
appellant only when its disclosure would 
constitute an “unjustified invasion of 
another individual’s personal privacy.”

* appeal 


Four requests were received from an 
agent who purported to act on behalf of 
four individuals who are patients in a 
psychiatric institution. The agent is a 
patientat thesame facility. These requests 
seek peisonal information respecting the 
four patients compiled while these in- 
dividuals were residents in the institu- 
tion. The requests were very broad in 
nature, covering periods from eight to 17 
years and encompassing records located 
in many program areas. 


The four patients each provided the 
Ministry with a letter of authorization 
granting the agent the authority to make 
the request and to proceed with any 
appeal to the Commissioner's office which 
might result from the request. 


For three of the requests, the Ministry 
wrote directly to the patients and indi- 
cated that, owing to concerns about pa- 
tient confidentiality, it was not prepared 
to honour these authorizations. The 
Ministry then asked the patients to verify 
in writing that they wished to proceed 
with their requests on the basis that any 
information located would be released to 


them directly. No responses were re- 
ceived from the patients with the result 
that the Ministry declined to further 


process these requests. 


For the fourth request, the Ministry proc- 
essed the file and then issued a decision 
letter in which it advised the patient that 
it would not honour the authorization. 
In the same correspondence, the Minis- 
try offered to provide the responsive 
records to the patient directly. Ina subse- 
quent telephone call, however, the agent 
advised the Ministry that the patient 
would only accept delivery of the deci- 
sion letter through the agent and that any 
documentation otherwise received would 
be returned. 


The sole issue for determination in these 
appeals was whether the Ministry acted 
reasonably in refusing to accept the au- 
thorizations purportedly granted by the 
patients to have the appellant act as their 
agent. 


ORDER 

It was held that the Ministry acted rea- 
sonably in refusing to accept the authori- 
zations purportedly granted by the pa- 
tients to the agent. 


The Ministry was also ordered to make 
all reasonable efforts to contact the pa- 
tients whose personal information was 
the subject of three of the appeals. Re- 
garding the fourth appeal, the Ministry 
was ordered to advise this patient of the 
contents of this order and to advise the 
patient that the Ministry remains willing 
to provide the personal information in 
question directly to the patient. 


In arriving at his decision, the Assistant 
Commissioner considered section 52(14) 
of the Actand section 3(3) of Regulation 
460 made under the Act. Section 52(14) 


reads as follows: 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The person who requested access to the 
record, the head of the institution concerned 
and any affected party may be represented 


by counsel or an agent. 


Section 3(3) of Regulation 460 states 
that: 


The head shall verify the identity of a person 

seeking access to his or her own personal 
information before giving the person access 
to it. 


The Assistant Commissioner noted that 
the purpose of section 52(14) is to allow 
persons to rely on the expertise of counsel 
or agents to obtain information under 
the provisions of the Act. Where an access 
request involves general records, there is 
no need for an institution to make in- 
quiries respecting the sufficiency of any 
authorizations which it may have re- 
ceived. Where, however, the subject 
matter of the request involves personal 
information of a principal, and an insti- 
tution has a concern that the agent who 
has made such a request lacks the requi- 
site authority to do so, the institution has 
the obligation to make whatever inquir- 
ies it considers reasonable to satisfy itself 
that the authorization is proper. 


In determining whether the Ministry 
acted reasonably in refusing to accept the 
authorizations provided by the patients, 
the Assistant Commissioner placed par- 
ticular weight on the following consid- 
erations. First, the personal information 
being sought was very sensitive in nature 
and was compiled over extended periods 
of time. Second, the clauses in the agree- 
ment which purported to prevent the 
Ministry from making direct contact 
with the patients effectively precluded 
the Ministry from complying with its 
obligations under section 3(3) of Regula- 
tion 460. Third, the fact that no response 
to the Ministry’s correspondence was 
received from three of the patients in- 


volved in these appeals was also a source 
of concern. 


Finally, the records at issue in these ap- 
peals were being sought from areas of an 
institution responsible for the care and 
treatment of particularly vulnerable in- 
dividuals. In these cases, institutions must 
take special care to ensure that authoriza- 
tions are provided in a free and voluntary 
manner. 


Taking all of these considerations into 
account, The Assistant Commissioner 
found that the Ministry acted reasonably 
in refusing to accept the authorizations 
purportedly granted by the patients to 
the agent. He pointed out, however, that 
the approach which the Ministry applied 
to assess the validity of the authorizations 
was flawed. Rather than takingana priori 
position that the authorizations provided 
by the patients were invalid, Ministry 
officials ought to have discussed this sub- 
ject with the patients involved before 
determining whether or not to accept the 
authorizations. [hat approach should be 
adopted should subsequent requests of 


this nature be received. 


For the purposes of the present appeals, 


it was clear that the Ministry had experi- 
enced considerable difficulty in discern- 
ing, in a direct and reliable fashion, the 
actual views of the patients with respect 
to the processing of their requests. For 
this reason, the Assistant Commissioner 
was of the view that it would be prudent 
for any further transactions pertaining to 
these requests to occur between the Min- 
istry and the patients directly. The pa- 
tients would then be free to share the 
information which they received with 
whomever they chose.

Rights Act 


A request was made for access to two 
copies of the requester’s vocational re- 
habilitation file for the period from No- 
vember 22, 1982 to November 6, 1992. 
The requester, who is visually impaired, 
asked that one copy be sent to him in 
regular format and that the other be 
provided in 24 point type (enlarged) 
bold print. 


The Ministry provided the requester with 
a copy of his file in regular print, but 
refused to supply him with a second copy 


in an enlarged format. In its decision 
letter, the Ministry submitted that sec- 
tions 30(1) and (3) of the Act governed 
the extent of its statutory obligations in 
this case. These sections essentially pro- 
vide that a requester is to be given access 
to a copy of the record to which he or she 
is entitled, unless it would not be reason- 
ably practicable to reproduce the record 
by reason of its length or nature. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


In Order 19, former Commissioner 
Sidney B. Linden considered the mean- 
ing of section 48(4). In that order he 
stated: 


T agree that subsection 48(4) of the Act does 
place a duty on the head to “ensure that the 
personal information is provided to the 
individual in a comprehensible form”. 
Clearly, the subsection creates a duty to 
ensure that the average person can compre- 
hend the record. For example, a computer- 
coded record would be incomprehensible to 
the average person if provided without the 
key which will ‘unlock’ it. 


But, does subsection 48(4) create a further 
duty on the head to assess a specific request- 
er sability to comprehenda particular record? 
With respect, I do not think that tt does. 


The Assistant Commissioner agreed with 
Commissioner Linden that, based on the 
scheme of the Act, the term “comprehen- 
sible” must be interpreted according to 
an objective standard. 


Section 11(1)(a) of the Ontario Human 
Rights Code (the Code) prescribes that: 


A right of a person under Part I [in which 
section I ts found] is infringed where a 


requirement, qualification or factor exists . 


that is not discrimination on a prohibited 
ground but that results in the exclusion, 


restriction or preference of a group of persons 
who are identified by a prohibited ground 
of discrimination and of whom the person 
is a member, except where, 


(a) the requirement, qualification, or factor 
is reasonable and bona fide in the circum- 
stances; 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
the Commissioner’s Office has an obliga- 
tion to interpret section 48(4) of the Act 
according to the principles set out in 


section 11(1)(a) of the Code. 


It was held that had the Ministry inter- 
preted section 48(4) of the Act based on 
an objective standard and applied the 
provision in this fashion without any 
effort to assist the requester, there would 
have arisen a restriction of the appellant's 
rights as a handicapped person pursuant 
to section 11(1)(a) of the Code, and there 
would have existed a prima facie breach 


of the provisions of the Code. 


However, the Assistant Commissioner 
found that the Ministry recognized the 
appellant’s special needs and that the 


-steps that the Ministry took to assist the 


appellant to comprehend his file allowed 
the appellant to effectively access his per- 
sonal information. As a result, the Min- 
istry’s decision not to transcribe the ap- 
pellant’s entire file into 24 point type 
bold print does not represent a contra- 
vention of section 11(1)(a) of the Code. 


In a postscript to the order, the Assistant 
Commissioner indicated that the task of 
defining the rights of visually impaired 
individuals to obtain access to their per- 
sonal information isa difficult one in the 
absence of clear statutory direction. Al- 
though not raised in the present appeal, 
the same comment would apply to 
requests from these individuals for access 
to general records. 


BARR 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The Assistant Commissioner then noted 
that these subjects have been addressed 
legislatively under the federal access and 
privacy schemes under section 12(3) of 
the Access to Information Act and section 
17(3) of the Privacy Act, respectively. In 
the same light, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner indicated that there is a need for 
the Government of Ontario to clearly 
establish the obligations of institutions 
when responding to access requests filed 
by visually impaired requesters. While 
such direction should, ideally, be pro- 
vided within the provincial and munici- 
pal Acts, themselves, the promulgation of 
a Management Board Guideline would 
represent a useful first step.

A request was made for access to 


information relating to an investigation 
of an allegation of sexual harassment 
against the requester. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


In its representations, the Ministry indi- 
cated that it was exercising its discretion 
to withhold certain parts of the records 
pursuant to section 13(1) of the Act 
under section 49(a). The Ministry also 
indicated that it had disclosed to the 
appellant the six words in the investiga- 
tion report that it had initially withheld 
from disclosure. 


The three records remaining at issue and 
the exemptions claimed by the Ministry 
for each may be described as two memo- 
randa for which sections 13(1) and 49(a) 
were claimed and only partial access was 
granted. Access to the witness statements 
were denied in full pursuant to section 


49(b). 


Section 23 is not referred to in section 
49(b). However, where an institution 
has properly exercised its discretion un- 
der section 49(b) of the Ac¢, relying on 
the application of sections 21(2) and/or 
(3), an appellant should be able to raise 
the application of section 23 in the same 
manner as an individual who is applying 
for access to the personal information of 
another individual in which the personal 
information is considered under section 
ds be 


The same approach should be taken in 
cases in which an institution has properly 
exercised its discretion under section 
49(a) where the sections of the Act enum- 
erated therein, which also appear in sec- 
tion 23 namely 13, 15, 17, 18 and 20, 
would apply to the disclosure of the 
personal information.

A request was received foraccess to records 
held by the Ministry of Finance or the 
Pension Commission of Ontario (PCO), 
an agency of the Ministry, relating to 
investigations of Standard Trustco 
Limited Designated Employees’ Retire- 
ment Plan (the Plan). The Ministry re- 
fused to confirm or deny the existence of 
such records pursuant to section 14(3) of 
the Act. The Ministry indicated that if 
records of the nature requested existed, 
they would be exempt under sections 


14(1)(a), (b). 


ORDER 

The Ministry’s decision to refuse to con- 
firm or deny the existence of records was 
not upheld. The Ministry’s decision not 
to disclose the records was upheld. 


In an appeal from a decision to refuse to 
confirm or deny the existence ofa record, 
the correctness of the decision is an issue 
to be determined on appeal (Order 
M-46). In this appeal, a conclusion was 
reached that section 14(3) of the Actwas 
not applicable and this was stated at the 
outset. Inquiry Officer Seife confirmed 
that records existed which were respon- 
sive to the appellant's request. 


The records which were identified by the 
Ministry as being responsive to the re- 
quest were: 1. A memorandum from an 
investigator in the Ministry’s Investiga- 
tions Branch to the Deputy Director of 


the Branch; 2. A memorandum from a 
Planand Investment Auditor of the PCO 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


to Senior Legal Counsel of the PCO; and 
3. Handwritten notes of Legal Counsel 
of the PCO. 


The Ministry submitted that sections 
14(1)(a), (b), (©), (d) and(g), and 14(2)(a) 
and (c) of the Act applied to the records. 


Inquiry Officer Seife was satisfied that 
the matter to which the records at issue 
related was a law enforcement matter, as 
the term is defined in section 2 of the Act. 


It was also held that the Ministry had 
provided sufficient evidence to establish 
that the disclosure of the records could 
reasonably be expected to interfere with 
a law enforcement matter or investiga- 
tion under sections 14(1)(a) and (b) and 
that all of the records qualified for ex- 


emption under these sections. 


After explaining the evolution that took 
place with respect to the interpretation of 
section 14 (3) in various orders, Inquiry 
Officer Seife went on to establish the 
following test: 


An institution relying on section 14(3) of 
the Act must do more than merely indicate 

that records of the nature requested, if they 

exist, would qualify for exemption under 

sections 14(1) or (2). The institution must 

establish that disclosure of the mere existence 

or non existence of such a record would 
communicate to the requester information 

that would fallunder either section 14(1) or 

(2) of the Act. 


The Ministry submitted that if section 
14(3) cannot be relied upon, it would be 
required to provide the appellant with a 
general description of each record, and to 
do so “could seriously jeopardize the 
investigation...”. 


The Ministry’s concerns related to harms 
that could occur as a result of the disclo- 
sure of the records themselves, rather 


than the disclosure of their mere exist- 
ence. The Act does not require the Min- 
istry to provide a description of a record 
which would reveal exempt information; 
rather, the records may be described in a 
general manner with sufficient 
information to allow the requester to 
havesome knowledge of the nature of the 
record so that the requester can make an 
informed decision on whether or not to 
appeal the decision of the institution to 
the Information and Privacy Commis- 
sioner.

Ministry denied access to the information 
based on the exemption contained in 
section 17(2) of the Act. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision not to disclose 
the letters of credit was upheld. 


The Assistant Commissioner also indi- 
cated, however, that in processing the 
request, the Ministry had failed to com- 
ply with its obligations under sections 24 
and 29(1)(b)(it) of the Act. 


Order 50 addresses the obligations of 
institutions when processing access 
requests where the raw data exists which 
would respond to the request but no 
record exists in the exact format requested. 
That order states as follows: 


... [W]hen an institution receives a request 

for information which exists in some re- 
corded format within the institution, but 
not in the format asked for by the requester, 
what duty is imposed on the institution? 


In cases where a request is for information 
that currently exists, either in whole or in 
part, inarecorded format different from the 
format asked for by the requester, in my 
view, section 24 of the Act imposes a respon- 
sibility on the institution to identify and 
advise the requester of the existence of these 
related records. It is then up to the requester 
to decide whether or not to obtain these 
related records and sort through and organ- 
ize the information into the originally de- 
sired format... 


The Act requires the institution to pro- 
vide the requester with access to all rel- 
evant records, however, in most cases, the 
Act does not go further and require an 
institution to conduct searches through 
existing records, collecting information 
which responds to a request, and then 
creating an entirely new record in the 
requested format. In other words, the 
Act gives requesters a right (subject 
to the exemptions contained in the Act?) 
to the “raw material” which would answer 
all or part of a request, but, . . . the institu- 
tion is not required to organize this 
information into a particular format 
before disclosing it to the requester. 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The Assistant Commissioner concluded 
that the “raw material” to answer the 
appellant’s request was, for the most part, 
available. 


By ‘rtue of section 24 of the Acz, there- 
fore the Ministry had an obligation to 
advise the appellant that the information 
which she was seeking was contained in 
the records responsive to part 2 of the 
request. On this basis, the Ministry was 
incorrect in advising the appellant that 
records which responded to the first and 
third parts of her request did not exist. 


A number of previous orders issued by 
the Commissioner's office have com- 
mented on the degree of particularity 
which should be contained in a decision 
letter issued by an institution. The gen- 
eral purport of these orders was neatly 
summarized in Order P-537 as follows: 


In providing a notice of refusal under sec- 
tion 29, the extent to which an institution 
describes a record in its decision letter will 
have an impact on the amount of detail 
required under section 29(1)(b)(ii). For 
example, should an institution merely de- 
scribe a record as a “memo”, more detailed 
reasons for denying access would be required 
than if a more expansive description of the 
record had been provided. Whichever ap- 
proach is taken, the key requirement is that 
the requester must be put in a position to 
make a reasonably informed decision on 
whether to seek a review of the head's 
decision (Orders 158, P-235 and P-324). 


The Assistant Commissioner concluded 
that, in this case, the Ministry had failed 
to provide any description whatsoever of 
the records that were responsive to one 
part of the request. The result was that 
the requester was effectively precluded 
from making a reasonably informed de- 
cision on whether to seek a review of the 
Ministry's decision. On this basis, the 
Assistant Commissioner concluded that 


10 


the Ministry had failed to comply with 
section 29(1)(b) of the Acé, with respect 
to the appellant's request. 


The Assistant Commissioner was then 
required to determine how the appellant 
should be provided with a general de- 
scription of the records. One option he 
considered involved remitting the case 
back to the Ministry so that a proper 


decision letter could be issued. 


The Assistant Commissioner considered, 
however, that such an outcome would 
create further delay and not serve the best 
interests of the appellant. 


Under section 54(1) of the Acs, the 
Commissioner, or his delegate, has the 
authority, once all the evidence for an 
inquiry has been received, to make an 
order disposing of all the issues raised by 
the appeal. Pursuant to this authority, 
the Assistant Commissioner determined 
that the fairest approach would be for 
him to generally describe the records 
responsive to one part of the request in a 
way that satisfies the minimum disclo- 
sure requirements contemplated under 
section 29(1)(b) of the Act. That descrip- 


tion was set out in the order. 


The Assistant Commissioner then turned 
to the consideration of section 17(2) of 
the Act. This provision indicates that an 
institution shall refuse to disclosea record 
that reveals information that was gath- 
ered for the purpose of collecting a tax. 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
the release of the letters of credit would 
reveal information which was gathered 
to enable the Ministry to ultimately col- 
lect a tax and that the two letters of credit 
and the renewal document were exempt 
from disclosure under section 17(2) of 


the Act.

The appellant requested access to par- 
ticulars surrounding a fire which oc- 
curred in the requester’s residence, prior 


to her moving in March 1989. 


ORDER 
The City’s search for responsive records 
was reasonable in the circumstances. 


During the processing of the appeal, it 
became clear that the City had not deter- 
mined whether any records responsive to 
the request existed in its custody or con- 
trol. Itindicated that even ifthe appellant 
were to pay the fees, there was no guaran- 
tee that any records would be located. 


It was determined that, before dealing 
with the fee estimate, it would be neces- 
sary to resolve the issue of whether the 
City has conducted a reasonable search 
to identify a record that would be respon- 
sive to the appellant’s request. 


Upon receipt of a request, the City must 
first be satisfied pursuant to section 17(1) 
of the Acz, that the request is sufficiently 
clear that “an experienced employee of 
the institution, upon a reasonable effort, 


[could] identify the record.” If the re- 
quest is not sufficiently clear, the City is

required by section 17(2) to offer the 
requester assistance in reformulating the 
request so as to comply with section 
17(1). In this appeal, both the City and 
the appellant have attempted to clarify 
the request, however, the appellant was 
not able to provide the City with a spe- 
cific date of the fire, which is the critical 
information required to locate the record, 
given the City’s current record keeping 
system. 


Inquiry Officer Seife noted that it is not 
appropriate for the City to issue a fee 
estimate for locating a record in circum- 
stances where it cannot reasonably ex- 
pect to identify a responsive record. The 
decision maker who issues the order in 
these circumstances has the responsibil- 
ity to ensure that the City has made a 
reasonable effort to identify the record, as 
required under section 17(1).

The City of Ottawa received a request for 
the dollar value of severance benefits 


offered/ provided to three commissioner- 
level city employees who took early re- 
tirement. 


The requester subsequently clarified his 
request and indicated that he was seeking 
access to “records that document the 
financial and/or benefit package offered 
or provided to three commissioner-level 
city employees” as well as “any non- 
monetary severance provisions contained 
in the package that may have value.” 


The City provided the requester with 
copies of the minutes of the Council 
meeting which considered the access re- 
quest, as well as the salary ranges and 
employment benefits package for the 
City’s executive group. The City, how- 
ever, denied access to the three early 
retirement agreements entered into be- 
tween the City with each former em- 
ployee pursuant to sections 10, 12, 
14(1)(f), 14(2) 14(3)(d) and (f) of the 
Act. These three agreements were the 
subject matter of this appeal. 


ORDER 
The decision of the City was partially 
upheld. 


All of the information contained in the 
three agreements, and in the appended 
schedules, with the exception of the last 
four clauses in each agreement, was held 
to fit within the definition of “personal 
information”. The clauses which were 
not considered information about iden- 
tifiable individuals, and which are better 
described as boilerplate, concerned 
severability; the governing law of the 
agreement; the release of the employer 
from contractual liability; the status of 
the document as the entire agreement 
between the parties; as well as the stand- 
ard closing and signature lines. 


Inanalysing this case, Assistant Commis- 
sioner Glasberg adopted the definition in 


Order M-23 for the term benefits, which 
is found in section 14(4)(a) of the Act. 


The word “benefits”, as it is used in 
section 14(4)(a), means entitlements that 
an officer or employee receives as a result 
of being employed by the institution. 
Generally speaking, these entitlements 
will be in addition to.a base salary. They 
include insurance-related benefits such 
as life, health, hospital, dental and dis- 
ability coverage. They will also include 
sick leave, vacation, leaves of absence, 
termination allowance, death and pen- 
sion benefits. As well, a right to reim- 
bursement from the institution for 
moving expenses will come within the 
meaning of “benefits”. [emphasis added] 


The Assistant Commissioner then found 
that, with some exceptions, each agree- 
ment contained clauses relating to the 
following topics: annual leave, sick leave 
credits, salary continuation, statutory 
holidays, accumulated annual leave, sal- 
ary and economic adjustments, leave 
without pay, insurance, benefit continu- 
ation, pension contributions, payments 
to be made in the event of death, pay- 
ment of tax, payment for financial con- 
sulting services, professional fees, legal 
fees, provision of reference letters, co- 
operation with income tax authorities, 
relief from employment duties, reloca- 
tion counselling, the triggering of leave 
payments in a lump sum, alternative 
employment and confidentiality. 


However, since the entitlements were 
negotiated by the three individuals in 
exchange for the acceptance by them of 
early retirement packages and were not 
received as a result of being employed by 
the City, these entitlements did not de- 
rive from the original contracts of em- 
ployment entered into between the par- 
ties, nor from periodic changes made to 
these contracts, and, therefore, did not 
constitute benefits as defined in Order 


1] 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


M-23. Consequently, the personal 
information contained in these agree- 
ments did not fall within the ambit of 
section 14(4)(a) of the Act. 


It was also held that section 14(4)(b) of 
the Act did not apply to the personal in- 
formation contained in the three agree- 
ments because the three former staff 
members were hired as employees and 
not as independent contractors having 
been retained pursuant to contracts of 
employment as opposed to contracts for 
personal services. 


The Assistant Commissioner then deter- 
mined that the information in the agree- 
ments which indicated the date on which 
each former employer was hired, the 
dates on which each former employee 
was eligible for early retirement, the 
information relating to the age of the 
individual, the number of years of serv- 
ice, the last day worked, the date of 
earliest retirement, the actual number of 
sick leave and annual leave days used and 
possible dates for the commencement of 
pensions under different formulae con- 
stituted information relating to the em- 
ployment history of each individual pur- 
suant to section 14(3)(d) of the Act. In 
addition, the Assistant Commissioner 
found that one agreement contained the 
amount which a former employee con- 
tributed to a pension plan and that this 
information fell within the presumption 
found in section 14(3)(f) of the Act be- 
cause it describes the individual’s finan- 
cial activities. 


Concerning the personal information 
that did not fall under the presumption, 
the Assistant Commissioner explained 
that in interpreting section 14(2), all the 
relevant circumstances of the case must 
be considered, not only the factors enu- 
merated in the section. 


12 


In order to establish the relevance of 
section 14(2)(a), the appellant must pro- 
vide evidence demonstrating that the 
activities of the City have been publicly 
called into question, necessitating disclo- 
sure of the personal information of the 
affected persons in order to subject the 
activities of the City to public scrutiny 
(Order M-84). 


Section 14(2)(a) of the Actwas a relevant 
consideration which weighed in favour 
of. releasing the personal information 
found in the retirement agreements be- 
cause, based on the evidence provided, 
it was fair to say that the City’s decision 
to negotiate these retirement packages 
was a matter of serious public debate. 


The Assistant Commissioner noted that 
previous orders issued by the Commis- 
sioner’s Office have held that, under 
appropriate circumstances, a relevant 
consideration in determining whether 
personal information should be released 
is whether “the disclosure of the 
information could be desirable for en- 
suring public confidence in the integrity 
of the institution”. 


In the circumstances of this appeal, pub- 
lic confidence was held to be a relevant 
consideration because the retirement 
agreements involved large amounts of 
public funds, the recipients were senior 
municipal employees with a high profile 
within the community, and the current 
recessionary climate places an unparal- 
leled obligation on officials at all levels of 
government to ensure that tax dollars are 
spent wisely. The considerations in fa- 
vour of disclosure were held to outweigh 
those which weighed in favour of pro- 
tecting the privacy interests of the em- 
ployees. 


It was held, however, that an adequate 
level of public scrutiny respecting the 


terms of theagreements could beachieved 
without disclosing the names or other 
identifying information of the former 
employees. 


Having concluded that some personal 
information found in the agreements 
would constitute an unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy either under sections 
14(3)(d) or (f) of the Acé, or as a result of 
thebalancing process undertaken through 
section 14(2), the Assistant Commis- 
sioner examined whether this information 
should be disclosed pursuant to the pub- 
lic interest override found in section 16 


of the Act. 


In order forsection 16 of the Actto apply, 
two requirements must be met. First, 
there must be a compelling public in- 
terest in the disclosure of the record. 
Second, this compelling interest must 
clearly outweigh the purpose of the 
exemption (Order M-6). 


Due to the fact that the majority of the 
information found in the retirement 
agreements had been ordered released, 
this level of disclosure should permit the 
appellant to adequately address the pub- 
lic interest concerns which he has ex- 
pressed. 


Based on these considerations, the As- 
sistant Commissioner did not find that 
there existed a compelling public interest 
in the disclosure of the remaining per- 
sonal information that clearly outweighed 
the purpose of the section 14 exemption.

© Municipal Act 


A request was made for access to a retire- 
ment settlement agreement (the agree- 
ment) entered into between the City and 
a former City employee. The City denied 
access to the agreement in its entirety 
based on the exemptions contained in 
sections 6, 10, 12, 13 and 14 of the Act. 


In her representations, the appellant in- 
dicated that the contents of the record 
were a matter of compelling public inter- 
est and that they should be released pur- 
suant to section 16 of the Act (the so- 
called public interest override). 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


ORDER 
The City’s decision was upheld. 


In its representations, the City submitted 
that section 6(1)(b) of the Actapplied to 
exempt the record from disclosure in its 
entirety. This provision reads as follows: 


A head may refuse to disclose a record, 


that reveals the substance of deliberations of 
a meeting of a council, board, commission 

or other body or a committee of one of them 

ifa statute authorizes holding that meeting 

in the absence of the public. 


The Assistant Commissioner pointed out 
that the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 8th 
edition, defines “substance” as the “theme 
or subject” of a thing. After having re- 
viewed the contents of the agreement 
and the representations, The Assistant 
Commissioner found that the “theme or 
subject” of the in camera meeting was 
whether the terms of the retirementagree- 
ment were appropriate and whether they 


should be endorsed. 


In Order M-184, which involved a re- 
quest for a similar type of agreement, the 
Assistant Commissioner had occasion to 
interpret the term “deliberations” which 
is also found in section 6(1)(b) of the Acz. 
He stated that: 


... ln my view, deliberations, in the context 
of section 6(1)(b), refer to discussions which 
were conducted with a view towards mak- 
ing a decision. Having carefully reviewed 
the contents of the Minutes of Settlement, I 
am satisfied that the disclosure of this docu- 
ment would reveal the actual substance of 
the discussions conducted by the Board, 
hence tts deliberations, or would permit the 
drawing of accurate inferences about the 
substance of those discussions ... 


The Assistant Commissioner then held 
that the financial terms of the agreement 


which is the subject of the present appeal 


would reveal the actual substance of the 
deliberations of the in camera meeting 


and that section 6(1)(b) applied. 


The Assistant Commissioner noted that 
the application of section 16 of the Acris 
limited to a total of six exemptions con- 
tained in the Act. Since section 6(1)(b) is 
not one of these, the public interest over- 
ride is not available in a situation where 
an institution has successfully applied 
section 6(1)(b) of the Act to withhold a 


record from disclosure. 


Ina postscript to the order, the Assistant 
Commissioner pointed out that this was 
the second order issued where the subject 
matter of the appeal involved early retire- 
ment agreements entered into between 
municipalities and senior employees. In 
Order M-173, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner stated that such agreements wat- 
rant a high degree of public scrutiny. 


Where early retirement agreements have 
been considered in meetings which are 
closed to the public, municipalities may, 
under certain circumstances, be permit- 
ted to rely on section 6(1)(b) of the Actto 
withhold access to information contained 
in these records. It would be unfortunate, 
however, if institutions began to use this 
provision to routinely shield the financial 
terms of such agreements from legiti- 
mate public scrutiny. 


Section 6(1)(b) is a discretionary exemp- 
tion which means that the head of an 
institution can choose to release 
information about a retirement agree- 
ment notwithstanding that it was dis- 
cussed in camera. The disclosure of this 
information would take place according 
to the approach outlined in Order M- 
173. That is, the contents of these agree- 
ments should be released except for 
information whose disclosure would con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of the 
employee’s personal privacy or reveal the 


name or other identifying information of 
the employee. 


In cases such as these, the Commission- 
er’s Office also has the obligation to en- 
sure that, when a head exercises his or her 
discretion to claim section 6(1)(b), such 
a decision is based on established legal 
principles. The Commissioner's Office

The appellant requested access to all 
personal information about himself that 
had been collected by the Metropolitan 
Toronto Police in the course of their sur- 
veillance or investigation of the appel- 
lant. 


The Police granted partial access to the 
records. The records identified as respon- 
sive to the request consisted of 11 pages 
from the notebooks of three police offic- 
ers, and related to one particular inci- 
dent. The appellant was provided with 
partial access to the records. The Police 
indicated that access was denied to the 
remaining portions of these records on 
the basis of sections 8(1)(l) and 14(1) of 
the Act. 


ORDER 

The decision of the Police was partially 
upheld. The Police were ordered to dis- 
close a decoded version of some 
information that had been coded. 


Inquiry Officer Big Canoe found that 
the disclosure of the personal information 
of the affected person contained in the 
records would constitute an unjustified 
invasion of the personal privacy of the 
affected person, and section 38(b) ap- 
plied. The remaining portion of the 
records consisted of one severance which 
was a code used by Police and two words 
following the code. The Police submit- 


16 


ted that this portion of the records quali- 
fied for exemption under section 8(1)(I) 
of the Act. 


On the basis of the submissions made by 
the Police, Inquiry Officer Big Canoe 
was not satisfied that the particular code 
qualified for exemption under section 
8(1)(l) of the Act. The Police did not 
demonstrate a clear and direct linkage 
between disclosure of the specific 
information exempted and the harm 
described in section 8(1)(I). 


Inquiry Officer Big Canoe agreed with 

the statement expressed in Order 19 

which referred to section 48 (4) of the 

Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act which corresponds with sec- 

tion 37(3) of the Act. In this Order, it 

was held that this section creates a duty 

to ensure that the average person can 

comprehend the record. 


In the circumstances of this appeal, it was 
held that there is no obligation on the 
Police to create a typewritten copy of the 
records. However, the information in its 
coded form was not comprehensible to 
the average person and, therefore, the 
Police were ordered to disclose a decoded 
version of the coded information.

The term “intelligence” is not defined in 
the Act. The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 
eighth edition, defines “intelligence” as 
“the collection of information, [espe- 
cially] of military or political value”, and 
“intelligence department’ as “a [usually] 
government department engaged in col- 
lecting [especially] secret information”. 


The Williams Commission in its report 

entitled Public Government for Private 
People, the Report of the Commission on 

Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy/1980, Volume II at pages 298- 

99, states: 


Speaking very broadly, intelligence 
information may be distinguished from 
investigatory information by virtue of the 
fact that the former is generally unrelated to 
the investigation of the occurrence of specific 
offenses. For example, authorities may en- 
gage in surveillance of the activities of per- 
sons whom they suspect may be involved in 
criminal activity in the expectation that the 
information gathered will be useful in fu- 
ture investigations. In this sense, intelli- 
gence information may be derived from 
investigations of previous incidents which 
may or may not have resulted in trial and 
conviction of the individual under surveil- 
lance. Such information may be gathered 
through observation of the conduct of asso- 
ciates of known criminals or through sim1- 
lar surveillance activities. 


Inquiry Officer Seife found that for the 
purposes of section 8(1)(g) of the Act, 
“intelligence” information may be de- 
scribed as information gathered by a law 
enforcement agency in a covert manner 
with respect to ongoing efforts devoted 
to the detection and prosecution of crime 
or the prevention of possible violation of 
law, and is distinct from information 
which is compiled and identifiable as 
part of the investigation of a specific 
occurrence.

INVESTIGATION 193-010P 
Institution: Ministry of Health 

SEPTEMBER 29, 1993

KEYWORDS 
harass * name 


A Ministry employee was the respondent 
in a complaint that had been filed under 
the Ontario Public Service’s Workplace 

- Discriminationand Harassment Preven- 
tion Program (WDHP). The employee 
complained that the Ministry had dis- 
closed his personal information in the 
context of the WDHP complaint, on 
four occasions: 1) the WDHP investiga- 
tion summary report containing the com- 
plainant’s personal information had been 
disclosed to the Manager, Director and 
Administrator; 2) the WDHDP interview 
questions containing the complainant's 
personal information had been disclosed 
to the interviewees; 3) the WDHP inves- 
tigator had disclosed the complainant’s 
personal information to several Ministry 
staff, and 4) personal information had 
been disclosed to the individual who had 
filed the WDHP complaint. 


CONCLUSION 

1. The IPC found that the personal 
information in the WDHP investigation 
summary report had been disclosed to 
the Manager, as the complainant's super- 
visor, and to the Director, as the Manag- 
er’s supervisor, and to the Administrator. 
The IPC determined that these disclo- 


sures were in accordance with section 


42(d) of the Act, since these individuals 
needed the information in the perform- 
ance of their duties of implementing 
remedial action based on the summary 
report. The IPC also determined that the 
disclosures were necessary and proper in 
the discharge of the Ministry’s function 
of providing a workplace free from dis- 
crimination and harassment. 


2. The IPC found that some of the 
interview questions had never been asked 
of the interviewees for whom they had 
been written. Of the interview questions 
which had been asked and which had 
contained the complainant’s personal 
information, the IPC found that it would 
not have been possible for the WDHP 
investigator to have properly investigated 
and determined the validity and accuracy 
of the allegations against the complain- 
ant without disclosing some of the details 
of those allegations to the individuals 
interviewed. The IPC concluded that the 
disclosures via the interview questions 
had been made for the purpose for which 
the information had been obtained or 
compiled, that being for the purpose of 
conducting a WDHP investigation into 
theallegations thathad been madeagainst 
the complainant. The disclosures, there- 
fore, had been made in accordance with 
section 42(c) of the Act. 


3. The IPC found that in order for the 
Ministry to meet its responsibility of 
providing a workplace free from dis- 
crimination and harassment, it had to 
conduct WDHP investigations when 
required. The IPC found thatthe WDHP 
investigator's disclosure of the complain- 
ant’s personal information had been nec- 
essary to the conduct of the WDHP 
investigation. The IPC also found that 
each of the individuals who were em- 
ployees had needed the particular per- 
sonal information disclosed to them in 
the performance of their duties. Thus, 
the IPC concluded that these disclosures

information had been obtained for the

4. The IPC found that the WDHP in- 
vestigator’s disclosure of the complain- 
ant’s personal information to the indivi- 
dual who had filed the WDHP com- 
plaint, had been for the purpose of keep- 
ing the complainant as well as the re- 
spondent informed of the details of the 
WDHP investigation. The IPC con- 
cluded that since the personal information 


had been obtained for the purpose of 


- conducting a WDHP investigation, it 


had been disclosed for the purpose for 
which it had been obtained. Therefore, 
the disclosure had been made in accord- 
ance with section 42(c) of the Act.

KEYWORDS 


labour ® disclose 


An Employer was engaged in a dispute 
with a union. The Union was seeking to 
unionize the employees and had com- 
menced certification proceedings before 
the Board. During the course of these 
proceedings, the Employer had been re- 
quired to submit four lists of its employ- 
ees to the Board. Ina letter to the Board, 
the Union had asked for a copy of these 
lists. In a written decision, the Board had 
complied with the Union’s request, or- 
dering that the employee lists be dis- 
closed to the Union. The Employercom- 
plained, on behalf of its employees, that 
the disclosure of the employee lists had 
been contrary to the Act. 


CONCLUSION 
The Board had relied on sections 42(a), 
(e) and (c) of the Act for the disclosure. 


The IPC found that, in accordance with 
previous compliance investigations, sec- 
tion 42(a) of the Act only applies in the 
context of a request by an individual, 


under Part II of the Act, for personal 


information relating to another indivi- 


dual. While the Union had requested in 
a letter accompanying its application for 
certification, that the employee lists be 
forwarded by the Board to the Union, no 
mention had been made that the request 
was pursuant to the Act. The IPC con- 
cluded that since the disclosure did not 
involve an access request under Part II of 


the Act, section 42(a) did not apply. 


However, the IPC found that, even as- 
suming that the request by the Union 
had been an access request under Part II 


of the Act, the Board would have had to 


20 


have complied with the provisions of 
Part II of the Act, in order for the disclo- 
sure to have been in accordance with 
section 42(a). The IPC found that the 
head had had reason to believe that the 
disclosure of the employees’ personal 
information might constitute an unjusti- 
fied invasion of personal privacy. There- 
fore, in order to comply with the notice 
provisions under section 28 of Part II of 
the Act, notice would have had to have 
been given to the employees. The IPC 
concluded that since no notice was given, 
the disclosure could not be said to have 
been in accordance with section 28 of 
Part II of the Act, and therefore, was not 
in accordance with section 42(a) of the 


Act. 


With respect to section 42(e) of the Act, 
the IPC found that the Board had relied 
on an implicit, rather than an express 
provision of the Labour Relations Act to 
authorize the disclosure of the employee 
lists to the Union. The IPC found that 
since there was no express provision of 
the Labour Relations Act which required 
the Board to disclose such information, 
the Board’s disclosure could not be said 
to have been “complying with an Act of 
the Legislature”. The IPC concluded 
that the disclosure was not in accordance 
with section 42(e) of the Act. 


With respect to section 42(c) of the Act, 
the IPC found that the Board had ob- 
tained the employee lists for the purpose 
of reviewing an application for union 
certification pursuant to section 8 of the 
Labour Relations Act. The IPC concluded 
that if, in the course of conducting such 
a review, the Board decided it was appro- 
priate for each of the parties to have access 
to the lists, then the Board’s disclosure of 
the lists to the parties was for the purpose 
for which they had been obtained, i.e. 
conducting a review of the application 
for union certification. The IPC con- 
cluded that since the personal information 


had been disclosed for the purpose for 
which it had been obtained by the Board, 
the disclosure was in accordance with 
section 42(c) of the Act.

An individual complained that the Work- 
ers’ Compensation Board (WCB) had 
disclosed her medical information in a 
Decision Review Specialist’s report to 
her employer. 


CONCLUSION 

TheIPChad previously investigated simi- 
lar complaints and had found that the 
disclosure of medical information in a 
Decision Review Specialist’s report to a 
WCB applicant’s employer was in ac- 
cordance with section 72(2) of the Work- 
ers’ Compensation Act which states: 


Every decision of the Board and the reasons 
therefor shall be communicated promptly in 
writing to the parties of record. 


Since such a disclosure complied with an 
Act of the Legislature, i.e., the Workers’ 
Compensation Act, the disclosure was 
found to be in accordance with section 


42(e) of the Act. 


The IPC, therefore, informed the com- 
plainant of these findings from our pre- 
vious investigations and our conclusion 
that they also applied to the circum- 
stances of her complaint.

Thecomplainant had written to the Chief 
ofa municipal police force, complaining 
about the conduct of police officers and 
the conduct of two doctors. The Deputy 
Chief of Police had forwarded the com- 
plaint letter to the Police Complaints 
Commissioner (the PCC). However, the 
complaints about the police had not been 
within the PCC’s jurisdiction. The PCC 


had then written to the College of Physi- . 


cians and Surgeons of Ontario (the Col- 
lege) regarding the complaints about the 
doctors, enclosing the complaint letter 
and a copy of the letter from the Deputy 
Chief. The complainant believed that 
the disclosure of the letters to the College 
had breached her privacy. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that since the letters 
contained recorded information about 
the complainant relating to her com- 
plaints about the police and doctors, they 
contained her “personal information”, as 
defined in section 2(1) of the Act. 


Since the personal information had been 
collected indirectly by the PCC, the rea- 
sonable expectations of the complainant 
could not be a factor in determining 


whether the disclosure to the College had 


been for a consistent purpose. Thus, the 
IPC considered whether the disclosure 
had been reasonably compatible with the 
purpose for which the personal 


information had been obtained by the 
PEC: 


The PCC’s purpose for obtaining the 
complainant’s personal information re- 
lating to her complaints about the doc- 


tors had been to investigate her com- 


plaints. However, the PCC had not been 
able to investigate because the complaints 
had not been within its jurisdiction. The 
College, however, had the proper juris- 
diction to investigate the complaints about 
the doctors. Thus, the disclosure to the 
College had been reasonably compatible 
with the purpose for which the personal 
information had been obtained. There- 
fore, the disclosure had been made in 
accordance with section 42(c) of the Act, 
for a consistent purpose. The complain- 
ant’s name and address had also been 
disclosed by the PCC to the College in 


accordance with section 42 of the Act 


However, the disclosure to the College of 
the complainant’s personal information 
relating to her complaints about the po- 
lice had not been reasonably compatible 
with the purpose for which the personal 
information had been obtained, since the 
College did not have the jurisdiction to 
investigate the complaints about the po- 
lice officers. Similarly, the disclosure of 
the complainant’s personal information 
relating to other matters had not been 
reasonably compatible with the purpose 
for which the personal information had 
been obtained, and thus contravened 
section 42(c) of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC acknowledged that the com- 
plainant’s personal information had been 
forwarded to the College as a service to 
thecomplainant. The IPC recommended 
that any personal information not re- 


lated to a complaint or necessary to ad- 
minister a complaint, be severed from 
the complaint forwarded to another body 
with the jurisdiction to investigate. The 
IPC also recommended that the PCC 
advise individuals if their complaints are 
being forwarded to another investigatory 


body.

notice ® collection 


The complainant was concerned about 
attendance review letters, regarding sick 
time, that had been sent to bargaining 
unit staff at one of the correctional facili- 
ties of the Ministry of the Solicitor Gen- 
eral and Correctional Services (the Min- 
istry). These letters were part of the proc- 
ess of reviewing, monitoring and con- 
trolling the attendance of all employees 
within the facility. Employees whose rate 
of absenteeism was becoming unaccept- 
able, were the subject of these letters. 


The complainant was concerned, how- 
ever, that the Ministry had not at any 
time notified the individuals involved, 
including himself, that the personal 
information contained in these attend- 
ance review letters had been collected. 
He was also concerned that the attend- 
ance review letters had subsequently been 
summarized in a list and posted on a 
notice board. 


CONCLUSION 

The Ministry acknowledged that notice 
of the collection of attendance infor- 
mation, which had later been included 


Zi

in the attendance letters, had not been 
given to staff who had been hired before 
the Act was in effect, in accordance 


with section 39(2). This included the 


complainant. 


However, the Ministry submitted that 
in its view sufficient notice had been 
provided to the complainant, since 
information about the collection had 
appeared in the 1993-1994 Directory of 
Records. 


It was the IPC’s view that including the 
information in the Directory of Records 
did not constitute sufficient notice of the 
Ministry’s collection. Such an approach 
would require that individuals regularly 
check the Directory of Records to deter- 
mine what information was being col- 
lected rather than being notified of the 
collection by the Ministry. This approach 
would not be consistent with the pur- 
poses of section 39(2) which is intended 
to make individuals aware ofinformation 
that is being collected and the purpose(s) 
for the collection. In the IPC’s view, the 
Ministry had not given notice of its col- 
lection of personal information to em- 
ployees hired before the implementation 
of the Act, as required by the Act. 


The Ministry acknowledged that the list 
containing summarized attendance 
information had been inappropriately 
placed in a public area where several 
employees had access to the information. 
The IPC concluded that the personal 
information in the summary list had not 
been disclosed in accordance with sec- 
tion 42 of the Act. However, the IPC 
noted that the list had been removed and 
placed in a confidential envelope for 
restricted use only and that the com- 
plainant had also received a verbal apol- 
ogy.

RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. the Ministry provide notice of the 
collection of attendance information to 
those employees hired before the imple- 
mentation of the Actin accordance with 
section 39(2) of the Acs and 


2. the Ministry include information 
about the requirements of the Actfor the 
disclosure of personal information in any 
policy or guidelines on the reviewing,

ees’ attendance.

A lawyer in private practice stated he had

Ministry. The facsimile had been in- 
tended for another department of the 
Ministry and had contained personal 
information about a Ministry client in- 
cluding her social benefits entitlement 
and the amount of her rent payments. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the Ministry had 
inadvertently disclosed the personal 
information to the lawyer. However, asa 
result of our contact, the Ministry took 
appropriate measures to minimize the 
possibility of misdirected facsimiles in 
the future. These steps included having 
the supervisor advise the employee re- 
sponsible, of the proper procedures for 
faxing personal information; making all 
front line managers of the area office 


aware of the complaint and providing 
them witha copy of the Ministry’s guide- 
lines on the transmission of facsimiles 


(based on those prepared by the IPC) for

employee 


A former employee of the Ministry com- 
plained thather privacy had been breached 
when her separation slip, placed in an 
envelope marked “(Named) Office” only, 
had been mailed to the office where she 
had previously worked. The envelope 
had been opened by an employee in the 
office, and had later been mailed to the 
complainant's home in an envelope 


marked “Confidential”. 


CONCLUSION 

Following the IPC contact with the Min- 
istry, the Freedom of Information and 
Privacy Co-ordinator sent a memo to all 
Ministry staff clarifying the Ministry’s 
position. It advised that personal records 
should be sent in a confidential envelope 
to one’s home address, if an individual 
has ceased employment with the Minis- 
try. On this basis, the complaint was 
settled.

An individual sent an unsolicited résumé 
to the Secretariat. The Secretariat then 
forwarded the resume to a third party for 
consideration, without thecomplainant’s 
consent. The complainant telephoned 
the IPC office with her concern. 


CONCLUSION 

The Secretariat was contacted by the 
IPC. The IPC found that the disclosure 
took place contrary to the Secretariat’s 
established policies and practices. These 
policies require that consent first be ob- 
tained from the individual, prior to sub- 
sequent disclosure to a third party. The 
IPC suggested that the Secretariat apolo- 
gize to the complainant, which the Sec- 
retariat agreed to do. The complainant 
was satisfied with this apology.

Institution: A Municipality

KEYWORDS 
confid ® security * WCB 


An employee of the municipality’s am- 
bulance service had attended an ambu- 
lance call which had caused him to expe- 
rience “critical incident” stress. The em- 
ployee had used the services of the ambu- 
lance service’s staff psychologist, and had 


filed a claim with the Workers’ Compen- 
sation Board (WCB). The employee 
stated that after the WCB claim had been 
filed, his supervisor had improperly col- 
lected and disclosed his personal 
information to the WCB, and the Psy- 
chologist had improperly disclosed his 
personal information to the supervisor 


and to the WCB. 


The employee also questioned the secu- 
rity of the ambulance service’s log books 
and telephone notes containing his per- 
sonal information. 


CONCLUSION 

With respect to the supervisor’s collec- 
tion of the complainant’s personal 
information, the IPC found that the 
ambulance service had had an obligation 
to ensure that the WCB had all the 
necessary information to process the 
employee’s WCB claim. The ambulance 
service had a health and safety unit (the 
unit) that had such responsibilities as the 
administration of WCB accident claims; 
the signing of compensation forms, and 
the submission of required reports and 
information. 


The IPC determined that it had been 
necessary for the supervisor to collect 
information relevant to the processing of 
the WCB claim, to give to the unit. The 
IPC concluded that since the supervi- 
sor’s collection had been necessary for the 
proper administration of the lawfully 
authorized activity of processing an em- 
ployee’s WCB claim, the collection had 
been in accordance with section 28(2) of 


the Act. 


With respect to the supervisor’s disclo- 
sure of the complainant’s personal 
information directly to the WCB, the 
ambulance service had relied upon sec- 
tion 32(e) of the Acz. It cited section 
133(1) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 
(the WCA), which states that an em- 


ployer must provide the WCB with any 
information respecting a claim which the 
WCB may require. The IPC concluded 
that since the unit had the responsibility 
of administering WCB claims, a disclo- 
sure to the WCB by the unit acting on 
behalf of the employer would have been 
in accordance with section 133(1) of the 
WCA. However, there was no documen- 
tation to show that the supervisor shared 
the responsibilities of the unit. Therefore 
the supervisor's disclosure directly to the 
WCB had not been in accordance with 
section 133(1) of the WCA and there- 
fore, was not in accordance with section 


32(e) of the Act. 


With respect to the psychologist’s disclo- 
sure to the supervisor, the ambulance 
service stated that it had relied on section 
32(d) of the Act. However, the IPC 
determined that the personal information 
disclosed by the psychologist to the su- 
pervisor had not been needed by the 
supervisor to perform his duties in re- 
spect of the WCB claim. Thus, the dis- 
closure had notbeen necessary and proper 
in the discharge of the institution’s func- 
tion of processing the claim. Therefore, 
the disclosure had not been in accord- 
ance with section 32(d). 


The ambulance service was also of the 
view that section 32(c) applied to the 
disclosure since the information had been 
collected by the psychologist to ensure 
the well-being of the complainant and 
had been disclosed to the supervisor for 
the same purpose. However, there was 
documentation regarding the confiden- 
tiality requirements of the Critical Inci- 
dent Stress Debriefing Team (the Team) 
of which the psychologist was a member, 
which emphasized that staff were enti- 
tled to strict and complete confidential- 
ity when consulting one of its members. 
Itwas the IPC’s view that itwas the Team 
and not the supervisor that had primary 
responsibility for the well-being of the 


23 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


employee and as part of that responsibil- 
ity, its members were required to abide 
by the confidentiality policy. The IPC 
regarded the disclosure by the psycholo- 
gist, which was contrary to this policy, 
not to have been for the well-being of the 
complainant. Therefore, the disclosure 
had not been for the same purpose for 
which the information had been col- 
lected and was not in accordance with 
section 32(c). 


With respect to the disclosure by the 
psychologist to the WCB, the psycholo- 
gist as an employee of the ambulance 
service, had been contacted by the WCB 
for further particulars respecting the 
employee’s claim. The IPC determined 
that the psychologist had disclosed per- 
sonal information in accordance with 
section 133(1) of the WCA and there- 
fore, the disclosure had been in accord- 
ance with section 32(e) of the Act. 


The IPC concluded that reasonable meas- 
ures had been in place to prevent unau- 
thorized access to supervisors’ log books 
and telephone notes while they were in 
the area office. However, the IPC found 
that these measures had not been defined 
and documented as required by section 
3(1) of Regulation 823, as amended by 
Regulation 395/91. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The IPC recommended that: 


1. the ambulance service should take 
steps to ensure that all staff were aware of 
the limited purposes for which the dis- 
closure of personal information is per- 
mitted under section 32 of the Act; 


2. ifitwas the ambulance service’s intent 
that supervisors should have equal re- 
sponsibility as the health and safety unit 
for the administration of WCB claims, 
including communicating directly with 
the WCB, then the ambulance service 
should clearly set this out in a written 


24 


policy, and ensure thatall staffwere made 
aware of it; and 


3. theambulance service’s privacy guide- 
lines should include information regard- 
ing the measures in place for the safe 
storage of supervisors’ logs and telephone 
notes, and access to them.

An employee of the municipality’s am- 
bulance service had attended an ambu- 
lance call which had caused him to expe- 
rience “critical incident” stress. The em- 
ployee had used the services of the ambu- 
lance service’s staff psychologist and had 
filed a claim with the Worker's Compen- 
sation Board (the WCB). He believed 
that his privacy had been breached when 
his supervisor consulted with the psy- 
chologist and with a Union Representa- 
tive about his treatment, diagnosis and 
follow-up interviews in connection with 


his WCB claim. 


The employee also questioned the secu- 
rity of the ambulance service’s log books 
and telephone notes which had con- 
tained his personal information. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the psycholo- 
gist had disclosed to the supervisor that 
he had had contact with the complainant 
about his WCB claim for critical incident 


stress. The ambulance service was of the 
view that section 32(c) of the Actapplied 
to the disclosure since the information 
had been collected in order to ensure the 
well-being of the complainant and had 
been disclosed to the supervisor for the 
same purpose. However, there was docu- 
mentation regarding the confidentiality 
requirements of the Critical Incident 
Stress Debriefing Team (the Team), of 
which the psychologist was a member, 
which emphasized that staff were enti- 
tled to strict and complete confidential- 
ity when consulting with one of its mem- 
bers. It was the IPC’s view that the Team 
and not the supervisor had the primary 
responsibility for ensuring the well-being 
of the employee, and as part of that 
responsibility, Team members were re- 
quired to abide by the confidentiality 
policy. The IPC regarded the disclosure 
by the psychologist, which was contrary 
to this policy, not to have been for the 
well-being of the complainant. The IPC 
concluded therefore, that the disclosure 
had not been for the same purpose for 
which the personal information had been 
collected and was not in accordance with 
section 32(c). 


With respect to the disclosure of the 
complainant’s personal information to 
the union representative, the ambulance 
service stated that the disclosure had been 
in accordance with section 32(e) of the 
Actsince the disclosure had been author- 
ized under an article of the collective 
agreement made under the Labour Rela- 
tions Act. The IPC determined that the 
article did not provide for the disclosure 
of the complainant’s personal 
information. Thus the disclosure did not 
comply with an agreement made under 
an Act and was not in accordance with 
section 32(e) of the Act. 


The IPC concluded that reasonable meas- 
ures had been in place to prevent unau- 
thorized access to log books and tel- 
ephone notes while they were in the area

The IPC recommended that: 


1. the ambulance service should take

KEYWORDS 
collection 


A teacher complained that the School 
Board was collecting personal information 
about its teachers on two forms: a medi- 
cal certificate and a pastoral reference 
form. 


The medical certificate requested a phy- 
sician to certify that the teacher met 
certain criteria and was able to perform 
the duties of a teacher. The certificate 
asked that a letter of explanation be at- 
tached where an individual did not meet 
the criteria and/or was unable to perform 


the job duties so that the School Board 


could assess what measures would be 


required in order to accommodate the 
restrictions in question. The complain- 
ant objected to the Board collecting this 
medical information. 


The pastoral form asked for information 
on how the teacher contributed and par- 
ticipated in the life of the church and/or 
the activities of the parish/local church 
community. The complainant felt that 
the Board should simply accept a letter 
from a priest, minister or deacon attest- 
ing to the religious conviction of the 


individual. 


CONCLUSION 
Through mediation, the School Board 


agreed to revise its two forms as follows: 


A. a clarification was added to the medi- 
cal certificate indicating that if a letter of 
explanation was to be attached, it should 
only contain a description of the indi- 
vidual’s medical restrictions, not a de- 
scription of the related medical disorder 
or condition; 


B. the pastoral reference would become 
optional, and as an alternative, a letter of 
reference from the individual’s pastor 
could be submitted. 


The complainant was satisfied with these 
changes in the Board’s collection of per- 
sonal information.

collection * notice 


A taxi driver complained that the City 
had failed to provide proper notice for 
the collection of personal information on 
its License Renewal Application (the ap- 
plication), as it pertained to taxicab driv- 
ers and owners. 


The complainant was also concerned 
that the City was collecting financial and 
criminal record information about taxi 
drivers and owners on the form, without 
the proper legal authority to do so. The 
complainant was specifically concerned 
with questions that were related to bank- 
ruptcy proceedings, outstanding judge- 
ments, and criminal convictions. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the City’s collection 
of information about criminal convic- 
tions for which a pardon had not been 
received, from taxicab owners and driv- 
ers was in accordance with section 28(2) 
of the Act. The IPC determined from a 
review of the Municipal Act and the 
relevant by-laws that the licensing of 
taxicab owners and drivers was a lawfully 
authorized activity. Since the City was 
required to determine if the issuance or 
renewal of a license would be contrary to 
the public interest, it was the IPC’s view 
that the collection of criminal record 
information was necessary to the proper 
administration of a lawfully authorized 
activity. 


The IPCalso found that the City’s collec- 
tion of financial information from own- 
ers and from taxicab drivers, who were 
also “lessees” of the licenses was in ac- 
cordance with section 28(2) of the Act. 
The City was required by its by-law to 
issue or renew a license except where, 
“havinga regard to his financial position, 
the applicant or licensee cannot be ex- 
pected to be financially responsible in the 
conduct of the business which is to be 
licensed or is licensed”. It was the IPC’s 
view that for these individuals, such fi- 
nancial information as bankruptcy status 


23 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


and outstanding judgements was an im- 
portant consideration when renewing or 
granting their licences. It was the IPC’s 
view that the collection of this information 
was necessary to the proper administra- 
tion of a lawfully authorized activity. 


However, the IPC found that the City’s 
collection of financial information from 
non-lessee drivers was not in accordance 
with section 28(2) of the Act, because 
non-lessee drivers could not be said to be 
conducting a “business which is to be 
licensed or is licensed”. In our view, the 
collection of the financial information 
from non-lessee drivers was, therefore, 
not necessary to the proper administra- 
tion of taxicab licensing. 


The IPC also found that the City did not 
provide notice of its collection on the 
application, as required by section 29(2) 
of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

During the course of our investigation, 
the City amended its application to in- 
clude proper notice. 


We thus recommended that the City 
discontinue the collection of financial 
information, i.e. the two questions con- 
cerning bankruptcy status and outstand- 
ing judgements, from non-lessee drivers. 
We suggested that in order to achieve 
this, the City may wish to revise its 
application, so that only drivers who 
were also lessees of licences, and owners 
were instructed to complete these two 
questions.

An individual complained to the IPC 
that the Chair of the Board had identi- 
fied him to a local newspaper, as one of 
four individuals who had made the 
greatest number of requests for access 
to information under the Act. The 
newspaper subsequently published 
this information. 


CONCLUSION 

Although the Board acknowledged that 
there had been a disclosure, it was of the 
view that section 50(1) of the Act had 
been applicable and that it had not been 
necessary to rely on section 32 for the 
disclosure. Section 50(1) of the Actstates 
that “if a head may give access to 
information under this Act, nothing in 
this Act prevents the head from giving 
access to that information in response to 
an oral request or in the absence of a 
request’. 


It was the Board’s view that the term 
“information” encompassed both per- 
sonal information and information that 
was not personal. 


However, the IPC’s view is that section 
50(1) of the Actwas designed to promote 
the routine disclosure of information 
other than personal information, in ac- 
cordance with the purposes of the Act. 


However, even assuming that section 
50(1) permitted the disclosure of per- 
sonal information in the absence of a 
request under Part I, the IPC’s view was 
that the disclosure would still have had to 
have been in accordance with the Act 
since 50(1) specifically states, “Ifa head 
may give access to information under this 
Act...”. In order to comply with Part I of 
the Acé, an institution must comply with 
section 21 which requires the notifica- 
tion of individuals in situations where 


disclosure of the personal information 
might constitute an unjustified invasion 
of personal privacy. In this case, there had 
not been any notification, therefore, the 
disclosure would not have complied with 
Part I of the Actand thus, would not have 
been in accordance with section 50(1). 


The IPC also determined that none of 
the provisions of section 32 applied to the 
disclosure. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that in future, 
the Board should take steps to ensure that 
all disclosures be made in accordance 
with the Act. For example, advice regard- 
ing the disclosure of the names of indivi- 
duals making access requests should be 
incorporated into any Board policies or 
guidelines concerning the Act.

A lawyer in private practice stated he had 
received a facsimile in error, from the 
Municipality. The facsimile had been 
intended for another department of the 
Municipality, and had contained per-

Municipality, including the fact that the 


client had passed an addiction program. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the Municipality 
had inadvertently disclosed the personal 
information to the lawyer. However, asa 
result of our contact, the Municipality 
took appropriate steps to minimize the 
possibility of facsimiles being misdirected 
in the future. These steps included advis- 
ing the employee in question of the 
proper faxing procedures and the distri- 
bution of faxing guidelines to all staff, 


accompanied by a summary of the com-

planned to develop a corporate fax cover 


sheet which would identify the Munici-

The Stadium Corporation of Ontario 
Limited (SkyDome) received a request 
under the Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (the Act) for 
access to copies of any and all reports, 
correspondence, memos or other docu- 
ments relating to the testing performed 
by [anamed company] prior to October 
1988 on the steel that was used in the 
construction of the retractable roof of 
SkyDome. After considering the sub- 
missions of a number of third parties, 
SkyDome decided to withhold access to 
the records in their entirety, pursuant to 
sections 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Acz. 
The requester appealed the decision. 


During the course of the appeal, the 
Office of the Commissioner learned 
that one group of records to which the 
appellant sought access was available 
for review at the City of Toronto’s 
Buildings and Inspections department. 


ORDER 
The decision of SkyDome was partially 
upheld. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg first 
considered whether the information 
contained in the records constituted 
trade secrets for the purposes of the first 
part of the section 17(1) test. In the 
course of this analysis, he accepted the 
definition of trade secret that was 


adopted by Commissioner Tom Wright 
in Order M-29. 


The Assistant Commissioner found 
that the disclosure of the information 
contained in the records would reveal a 
series of novel construction and test- 
ing techniques developed during the 
construction of the SkyDome structure. 
He indicated that a number of court 
decisions have held that, where Party X 
has used his or her skill and knowledge 
base to produce a result which another 
party could only obtain independently 
through the investment of comparable 
time and effort, the courts will protect 
the proprietary interests of Party X in 
the information relating to the develop- 
ment of the product. That result will be 
achieved through the application of 
principles of fairness to prevent other 
parties from making use of the infor- 
mation to the detriment of Party X. 


The Assistant Commissioner went on to 
state that the information contained in 
the majority of the records represents 
an acquired body of knowledge, expe- 
rience and skill relating to the develop- 
ment of certain techniques, methods 
and processes unique to the construc- 
tion of the SkyDome structure. He 
then concluded that this knowledge 
base, which may be described as a 
learning curve, confers proprietary 
rights on its owners. 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
this learning curve embodies elements 
of a method, compilation or process 
which is contained in a device, product 
or mechanism. On this basis, the first 
aspect of the definition of a trade secret 
has been met. He then concluded that 
the information which collectively 
makes up this learning curve may be 
used in the architectural, engineering or 
construction trades and is not gener- 
ally known in these trades. On this 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


basis, the next two components of the 
test have been established. 


With respect to the fourth component 
of the test, the Assistant Commissioner 
determined that the information con- 
tained in the record groupings would, if 
disclosed, provide competitors with a 
knowledge base which the builders of 
SkyDome took many years to develop. 
This information could also be used by 
such competitors to the detriment of 
the original construction group. For this 
reason, he found that the information 
contained in the records has economic 
value, which could be compromised if 
generally known. 


The Assistant Commissioner then 
pointed out that, in order to qualify as a 
trade secret, the information in question 
must be subject to efforts which are 
reasonable, in the circumstances, to 
maintain its secrecy. He noted that the 
information at issue was circulated to a 
number of members of the construction 
group. The question is whether this 
distribution of the reports suggests that 
the efforts taken to maintain the secrecy 
of the proprietary information were 
sufficient. In order to address this issue, 
it is important to recognize that the 
construction of a structure as complex as 
SkyDome requires the interplay of many 
construction professions and trades. In 
this respect, it is unrealistic to assume 
that a single firm, which has acquired or 
otherwise developed specific proprietary 
information, could complete a major 
construction project without sharing 
this information with other participants. 


The Assistant Commissioner stated that 
the fact that information of this nature 
comes into the possession ofa number of 
firms involved in a construction project 
does not affect its confidential character, 
provided that the information was: (1) 
imparted to the other participants in 
confidence; and (2) has not become the 


subject of general knowledge in the 
trade. He concluded, based on the facts 
of the case, that both SkyDome and 
the affected persons took efforts which 
were reasonable in the circumstances to 
maintain the confidentiality of the infor- 
mation contained in the records. The 
Assistant Commissioner then found that 
the second and third parts of the section 
17(1) test had been fulfilled with the 
result that the records were exempt from 
disclosure. 


The Assistant Commissioner then con- 
sidered the records which were publicly 
available in the City of Toronto’s Build- 
ings and Inspections department. The 
key issue for determination was whether 
these records were supplied in confi- 
dence to SkyDome for the second part 
of the section 17(1) test. In determining 
this issue, the Assistant Commissioner 
pointed out that the section requires 
that the expectation of confidentiality 
be founded on reasonable grounds. The 
Assistant Commissioner then indicated 
that, in determining whether an expecta- 
tion of confidentiality is based on 
reasonable and objective grounds, it is 
necessary to consider all the circum- 
stances of the case, including whether 
the information was: 


1. Communicated to the institution on 
the basis that it was confidential and that 
it was to be kept confidential. 


2. Treated consistently ina manner that 
indicates a concern for its protection 
from disclosure by the affected person 
prior to being communicated to the 
government organization. 


3. Not otherwise disclosed or available 
from sources to which the public has 
access. 


4, Prepared for a purpose which would 


not entail disclosure. 


Based on the fact that these records were 
available from a public source, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner was unable to con- 
clude that they were supplied to the 
institution in confidence either explicitly 
or implicitly. This meant that SkyDome 
could not rely on section 17(1) of the Act 
to exempt these records from disclosure.

The Ministry of Health (the Ministry) 
received two requests from different 
requesters pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act 
(the Ac?) for access to the “version codes” 
associated with the health numbers of 
three named individuals. In each case, 
the requester provided the Ministry with 
the name of the individual, the date of 
birth, the address and his or her health 
card number. The Ministry denied 


access to the requested information in 
both cases pursuant to sections 18(1)(c) 


and (d) of the Acz. 


Neither appeal could be settled by me- 
diation. Notice that an inquiry was being 
conducted to review the decisions of the 
Ministry was sent to the Ministry and the 
appellants. The parties were also asked to 
comment on the application, if any, of 
section 21 of the Act to the information 
at issue in these appeals. Representations 
were received from the Ministry, and the 
Ontario Medical Association (the OMA), 
acting as agent for one of the appellants. 


The scope of the appeals was limited to 
the “version codes” of three named 
individuals. These individuals were 
patients who were treated by physicians 
who were unable, for various reasons, to 
ascertain the patients’ version codes. 
Accordingly, the physicians’ claims for 
reimbursement for medical services 
provided to these patients were rejected 
by the Ministry. 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 
requested information. 


The information requested was accessed 
through the Ministry's Registered Per- 
sons Database. The record which con- 
tained the information requested was the 
patients’ Registrant Detail Inquiry. 


The version code itself was a one or two 
uppercase alpha character, for example 
“A” or “CC”. It was located in the lower 
right-hand corner of the health card. A 
version code isassigned toa health number 
whenever a replacement health card is 
issued. Replacement cards are issued 
when a registered person turns 65, 
requests a new card to reflect a name 
change or correction, or reports that 
their original card has been lost, stolen 
or damaged. There is no connection 


between the assignment of a particular 
version code and the reason for its assign- 
ment; version codes are assigned on a 
completely random, computer-generated 
basis. 


Essentially, the concept of the version 
code is simply a method to make any 
replacement card different from the 
original. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg concluded that 
there was nothing inherent in the version 
code itself that would allow one to iden- 
tify any particular individual. In fact, the 
version codes responsive to the requests 
were the same for two of the individuals. 
Accordingly, the requested information 
did not fall within the definition of “per- 
sonal information” in section 2(1) of the 
Actand, consequently, there could not 
be an unjustified invasion of personal 
privacy within the meaning of section 21 


of the Act. 


With respect to the exemptions claimed 
under sections 18(1)(c) and (d) of the 
Act, Inquiry Officer Fineberg found that 
there was no evidence to establish a clear 
and direct linkage between the disclosure 
of the requested version codes in these 
appeals and the suggested harm, i.e., the 
payment of fraudulent claims. 


Moreover, if, assome Ministry personnel 
have suggested before the Legislative As- 
sembly, the vast majority of improper 
version code claims are not due to fraud 
but to out-of-date records, then there is 
no economic harm to the Ministry re- 
sulting from disclosure of the version 
codes. Rather, the Ministry will receive a 
financial benefit for non-payment of 
legitimate claims and the health care 
providers will assume the costs in situa- 
tions in which, for various reasons, they 
cannot ascertain the version code of 
patients whom they have treated.

information.

The Ministry of Industry, Trade and 
Technology (now the Ministry of Eco- 
nomic Developmentand Trade) received 
a request under the Freedom of Infor- 


mation and Protection of Privacy Act (the 
Act) for access to all information pertain- 
ing to loans or grants provided by the 
Ministry to a named corporation from 
1970 to the date of the request. In 
particular, the requester sought records 
pertaining to policy discussions and 
proposals submitted by this corporation 
to the Ministry respecting the establish- 
ment of a technology centre. 


The Ministry decided to release some of 
the documents to the requester in their 
entirety. The Ministry, however, denied 
access, either in whole or in part, to 35 
records pursuant to sections iP ehy 


17(1)(a), (b) and (c), 19and 21 of the Acz. 


ORDER 


The decision of the Ministry was par- 
tially upheld. 


In its representations, the corporation 
requested that the terms of the order 
require that the appellant pay the corpo- 
ration’s legal costs of the appeal. In re- 
sponding to this request, Assistant 
Commissioner Glasberg first pointed out 
that it isa general principle ofadministra- 
tive law that an administrative tribunal 
possesses only those powers which it has 
been granted by its enabling statute, by 
necessary implication or through some 
statute of general application. The Assist- 
ant Commissioner then went on to ex- 
amine the provisions of the Act to deter- 
mine whether such a power has been 
accorded to the Commissioner expressly 
or by necessary implication. 


Following a review of the legislation, he 
found that the Act does not expressly 
provide the Commissioner or his del- 
egate with the authority to award costs to 
a party in an appeal. He then considered 
whether an implied power of this nature 
could be found under sections 54(1) and 
(3) of the legislation. These provisions 
authorize the Commissioner to make an 


order disposing of the issues raised in the 
appeal and to incorporate any terms and 
conditions that the Commissioner con- 
siders appropriate. 


The Assistant Commissioner pointed out, 
however, that these broadly worded pro- 
visions must be read in conjunction with 
section 52(1) of the Act, which outlines 
the scope of the duty of the Commis- 
sioner to conduct an inquiry. This provi- 
sion specifies that, where a settlement is 
not effected, the Commissioner shall 
conduct an inquiry to review the head’s 
decision. The Assistant Commissioner 
found that, based on the wording of this 
section, any terms or conditions attached 
to an order must bear directly on the 
contents of the head’s decision or the 
process by which that decision was is- 
sued. The Assistant Commissioner con- 
cluded that since the question of whether 
costs should be awarded in a proceeding 
is not directly related to the review of a 
head’s decision, the power of the Commis- 
sioner to award costs cannot be implied 
from the provisions of the Act. 


Finally, the Assistant Commissioner 
found that there is no statute of general 
application, to which the Act is subject, 
which provides the Commissioner with 
the power to award costs. On this basis, 
the Assistant Commissioner came to the 
conclusion that the Office of the Commis- 
sioner does not possess the requisite au- 
thority to make an award of costs in the 
course of issuing an order under the Act. 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
two of the three records in which the 
section 19 exemption was claimed were 
prepared by one Crown counsel for use 
by another Crown counsel in giving legal 
advice and qualified for exemption un- 
der Branch 2 of the section 19 exemp- 
tion. The third record for which the 
section 19 exemption was claimed con- 
sisted of a letter sent to the Ministry's 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Director of Human Resources by an 
external law firm. The Ministry had 
commissioned this firm to conduct an 
inquiry into the activities ofa representa- 
tiveofanamed third party, respecting the 
corporation’s proposal and the manner 
in which Ministry staff responded to the 
actions of that party. 


After referring to the contents of Order 
210, the Assistant Commissioner con- 
cluded that the letter did not contain a 
legal opinion which is necessary for a 
finding that a record constitutes legal 
advice. [his conclusion was reached based 
on the fact that the letter made no refer- 
ence to any statutory provisions or case- 
law, nor did it attempt to connect the 
present state of the law with the conclu- 
sions which were reached in the docu- 
ment. Rather, this record represented an 
internal investigation report, as opposed 
to a legal opinion. 


The Assistant Commissioner then went 
on to consider the claim for exemption 
under section 17(1)(b) of the Act. Fol- 
lowing a review of the law in the area, he 
pointed out that in order to meet the 
requirements of the third part of the 
section 17(1)(b) test, the Ministry and/ 
or the affected person must demonstrate, 
through the provision of detailed and 


convincing evidence, that: 


1. The disclosure of the information in the 
records could reasonably be expected to 
result in similar information no longer 
being supplied to the institution; and 


2. It is in the public interest that similar 
information continue to be supplied to the 
institution in this fashion. 


The Assistant Commissioner held that 
disclosure of the type of information at 
issue could provide an applicant's com- 
petitors with an unfair and, at times, 
significant business advantage. He went 
on to state that, if such information were 


subject to release under the Act, this 
approach could reasonably be expected 
to create an environment where other 
prospective loan applicants would no 
longer supply information to the Minis- 
try which was as frank and detailed as 
would otherwise be the case. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg then 
considered whether it was in the public 
interest that such information continue 
to be supplied to the Ministry from such 
loan applicants. He concluded that the 
need to promote economic growth and 
to create jobs represent two of the Min- 
istry’s key objectives. The provision of 
financial assistance to private sector en- 
terprises represents one vehicle through 
which the Ministry can achieve this goal. 
Given the limited fiscal resources which 
are available for such programs, it is 
crucial that the process for allocating loan 
funds is based on the highest quality 
information which the Ministry can ob- 
tain. Information of this character will, in 
turn, only be forthcoming where appli- 
cants have the confidence to know that 
such materials will not be subject to 
disclosure outside the Ministry. 


For these reasons, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner found that there is a strong public 
interest in ensuring that detailed and 
frank information from prospective loan 
applicants continue to be supplied to the 
Ministry. 


As a result, the Assistant Commissioner 
found that the third part of the section 
17(1)(b) test had been satisfied with re- 
spect to the majority of the records at 
issue in the appeal.

The Ministry of Environment and En- 
ergy (the Ministry) received a request 
under the Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (the Act) for 
access to information relating to the con- 
tamination of soil in the vicinity of a 
named property. After communicating 
with the affected person, the Ministry 
decided to disclose the record. The 
affected person appealed the Ministry's 


decision to disclose. 


ORDER 
The Ministry's decision to disclose was 


upheld. 


The record identified as responsive to the 
request consisted of an 1 1-page Agree- 
ment, dated June 22, 1990, entered into 
between the Ministry and the owner of 
the property (the company) respecting 
the clean up of soil in the area. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg had to 
determine whether the mandatory ex- 
emption provided by sections 17(1)(a), 
(b) and (c) of the Act applied to the 
Agreement in question. He found that, 
based on the representations provided to 
him and the circumstances of this case, 
the terms and conditions contained in 
the Agreement were negotiated between 
the Ministry and the company, and there- 
fore, the information did not qualify as 


10 


originally having been “supplied” for the 
purposes of section 17(1) of the Act 
(Orders 36, 87, 203, P-219, P-228, P- 
251, P-263 and P-581). He then pointed 
out that the failure to satisfy any compo- 
nent of the three-part test means that the 
section 17(1) exemption will not apply. 
In deference to the representations made 
by the company, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner considered whether the infor- 
mation contained in the Agreement was 
supplied in confidence and whether the 
release of the Agreement would result in 
any of the harms outlined in this section. 


The Assistant Commissioner noted that 
paragraph 13 of the Agreement specified 
that the approval of the Lieutenant Gov- 
ernor in Council is required before the 
Agreement will take effect. Paragraph 14 
provided that neither party was permit- 
ted to disclose the terms of the Agree- 
ment before the requisite approval under 
paragraph 13 was obtained. He found 
that while there was an expectation that 
the terms of the Agreement would be 
kept confidential at the time that the 
document was drafted, that expectation 
was time limited and, by virtue of para- 
graphs 13 and 14 of the document, no 
longer existed once the approval of the 
Lieutenant Governor had been obtained. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg then 
considered whether the company has 
met the third part of the section 17(1) 
test. he company submitted that it was 
involved in litigation with the original 
requester, but that it has not yet been 
served with a statement of claim. Accord- 
ing to the company, the disclosure of the 
Agreement, which it viewed as being 
subject to privilege, could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with the rights and 
privileges of the company in the litiga- 
tion pursuant to section 17(1)(a) of the 
Act. The company also maintained that, 
should the Agreement be released, the 


original requester would obtain an un- 


due gain undersection 17(1)(c) of the Act 
in that this party would likely not have 
received access to this same document 
under the civil litigation process. 


The Assistant Commissioner pointed out 
that the relationship between the access 
provisions contained in the Act and the 
civil litigation process, is addressed in 
section 64(1) of the Act. This provision 
states that: 


This Act does not impose any limitation on 
the information otherwise available by law 
to a party to litigation. 


He then went on to endorse the com- 
ments made in Order 48. In this order, 
the application of section 64(1) was co- 
gently summarized by former Commis- 
sioner Sidney B. Linden where he made 
the following point: 


... Had the legislators intended the Act to 
exemptall records held by government insti- 
tutions whenever they are involved as a 
party ina civil action, they could have done 
so through use of specific wording to that 
effect. No such exemption exists, and, in my 
view, subsection 14(1)(f) or section 64 
cannot be interpreted so as to exempt records 
of this type without offending the purposes 
and principles of the Act. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg stated 
that the Actcontains an exhaustive list of 
the exemptions which are available to an 
institution should it wish to deny access 
to a particular record. As a result, there 
does not exist a discrete settlement privi- 
lege under the Act, and litigation privi- 
lege is only available pursuant to the 
discretionary exemption contained in 
section 19 of the Act. The Assistant 
Commissioner rejected the company’s 
position that the privileged status of the 
Agreement in another context is suffi- 
cient to trigger the application of either 
section 17(1)(a) or (c) of the Act. Since 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/

the company had not provided any other 
evidence to indicate that the harms con- 
templated under these sections will likely 
come to pass, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner found that the third part of the 
section 17(1) test also had not been 
satisfied.

The Ministry of Health (the Ministry) 


received a request under the Freedom of 


192 


Information and Protection of Privacy Act 
(the Act) for access to records relating to 
a named psychiatric patient, who was 
detained at a psychiatric hospital as a 
result of having been found not guilty by 
reason of insanity on two charges of 
attempted murder. The requester was 
seeking access to information pertaining 
to the conditions of the patient’s deten- 
tion and/or release. 


The Ministry had denied access to the 
records pursuant to sections 65(2)(a) and 
(b) of the Act. The requester appealed the 
Ministry’s decision, and the Ministry 
was asked to provide the IPC with a copy 
of the records pertaining to the appeal. 
To date, acopy of the record has not been 
provided to the IPC. 


ORDER 
The Ministry was ordered to produce all 
records which respond to the request 


relating to this appeal. 


The Ministry, in its submissions, argued 
that the records are not accessible under 
the Act pursuant to section 65(2) of the 
Act and, accordingly, the Act has no 
application to the records. The Ministry 
also indicated that section 35 of the 
Mental Health Act (the MHA) prohibits 


the Ministry from providing the records 


to the IPC. 


After examining the purpose of the Act, 
which is to provide access to information 
in accordance with the principle that 
“decisions on the disclosure of govern- 
ment information should be reviewed 
independently of government”, the In- 
quiry Officer concluded that, in keeping 
with this principle, while the Legislature 
clearly intended that clinical records 
should fall outside the purview of the Act, 
the Legislature did not intend to have the 
threshold issue of whether or not records 
fall within the scope of section 65(2) 
determined by a non-independent body, 


such as the Ministry, whose decision 
would not be reviewable. 


The Inquiry Officer found that the 
Commissioner (or his delegate) does have 
the power to compel the production of 
records claimed to be covered by section 
65(2). This power to compel initially 
would be exercised for the limited pur- 
pose of determining whether or not the 
records fall within the scope of section 
65(2) of the Act. If, having reviewed the 
records, a decision maker determines 
thatthe Ministry’s claim is correctly made, 
pursuant to section 65(2), the records 
would be returned to the Ministry and 
the appeal would be closed, since the 
Commissioner would not have the juris- 
diction to conduct a further inquiry. 
However, ifa decision maker determines 
that an institution’s claim is not validly 
made with respect to some or all of the 
records (i.e., that section 65(2) does not 
apply to some or all of the records), then 
a decision maker will be required to 
proceed with the inquiry and to deter- 
mine the application of the Act to the 
records. 


Inquiry Officer Big Canoe then dealt 
with the Ministry’s submission that it is 
prohibited by section 35 of the MHA 
from providing the records to the 
Commissioner. After examining the rel- 
evant subsections of this section, she 
concluded that an order of the Commis- 
sioner (or his delegate) requiring produc- 
tion of a record fits within the ambit of 
section 35(5) of the MHA. Furthermore, 
Inquiry Officer Big Canoe found that 
the WHA would require a psychiatric 
facility to disclose the records, in the face 
of an order of the Commissioner (or his 
delegate) to produce the records, unless it 
can be shown that the harms described in 
section 35(6) and (7) would be likely to 


result from the disclosure.

(ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GLASBERG) 


KEYWORDS 

solicitor client privilege ¢ legal accounts 
* purposes of the Act legal advice * in 
contemplation of litigation 


The Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
(the Ministry) received a request under 
the Freedom of Information and Protec- 
tion of Privacy Act (the Act) for a copy of 
all paperwork within a specific timeframe 
relating to an enrolment in the Ontario 
Farm Adjustment Assistance Program 


~ (OFAAP). 


The appeal focused on the interpretation 
of the section 19 exemption with respect 
to records that the Ministry described as 
“legal accounts”. 


ORDER 
The head’s decision was partially upheld. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg com- 


_ menced his analysis by reflecting on the 


characteristics of a legal account as a 
discrete type of document. He stated that 
a legal account is essentially an invoice 
which itemizes the services rendered by a 
law firm and the amounts charged for 
these services. From this perspective, a 
legal account is no different than an 
invoice for services remitted to an institu- 
tion by a consultant or other category of 
professional. The distinguishing feature 


of a legal account is that it is issued by a 


law firm to its client and relates to the 
provision of legal services. 


The Assistant Commissioneralso pointed 
out that, although a legal account arises 
out of a solicitor client relationship, this 
record category differs qualitatively from 
legal opinions or other communications 
which purport to provide legal advice 
from a lawyer to his or her client (and 
which have traditionally attracted the 
solicitor client privilege at common law). 
To put the matter somewhat differently, 
the essence of a legal opinion is that it 
provides legal advice to a client with 
respect to discrete legal issues. The 
essence of a legal account is that it 
requests payment for legal services pre- 
viously rendered. 


The Assistant Commissioner also noted 
that legal accounts do not always assume 
the same form. In some cases, the break- 
down of services provided is extremely 
detailed such that a review of the account 
would reveal the substance of the legal 
advice requested or provided, or the legal 
strategies pursued. On the other hand, 
some legal accounts contain nothing 
more than a general statement that legal 
work was undertaken and that a specific 
global amount is payable. In these latter 
situations, the fact that the invoice is a 
legal account can sometimes only be 
gleaned by referring to the letterhead on 
the statement. 


The Assistant Commissioner then re- 
viewed the manner in which legal ac- 
counts had been treated at common law. 
Based on his review of the relevant cases, 
the Assistant Commissioner concluded 
that the common law position on whether 
legal accounts, in whole or in part, are 
protected by the solicitor client privilege 
is still unclear. That being the case, he 
concluded that his determination of 
whether section 19 applies to the legal 
accounts at issue in this appeal must be 


based exclusively on the wording and the 
intent of the Act. 


The Assistant Commissioner then ad- 
dressed the Ministry’s submission that 
the section 19 exemption should be in- 
terpreted liberally with a view towards 
protecting the legal accounts from dis- 
closure. He concluded, however, that 
section 19 of the Act (like every other 
discretionary exemption contained in the 
legislation) must be interpreted accord- 
ing to the stated purposes of the legisla- 
tion. These underlying principles, set out 
succinctly in section 1 (a) of the Act, state 
that information should be available to 
the public and that the necessary exemp- 
tions from the right of access should be 
limited and specific. 


The Assistant Commissioner expressed 
the view that this provision reveals a 
legislative intent that discretionary ex- 
emptions should be interpreted narrowly 
and that it is the obligation of institutions 
to err on the side of releasing infor- 
mation. Based on an analysis of this 
section, he was unable to accept the 
fundamentally opposite submission ad- 
vanced by the Ministry that section 19 
should receive a broad and liberal 
interpretation. 


The order next canvassed the Ministry’s 
submission that the Office of the 
Commissioner does not have the author- 
ity to consider factors, other than those 
established at common law, to determine 
whether the contents of a record fall 
within the section 19 exemption. The 
Assistant Commissioner pointed out, 
that this position is inconsistent with the 
important principle of severance which is 
established in section 10(2) of the Act. 
This provision states that: 


Where an institution receives a request for 


access to a record that contains information 
that falls within one of the exemptions 


1S 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


under section 12 to 22, the head shall 
disclose as much of the record as can reason- 
ably be severed without disclosing the 
information that falls under one of the 


exemptions. 


In the Assistant Commissioner’s view, it 
is entirely consistent with the wording of 
this section for the Office of the Commis- 
sioner to articulate tests to determine 
when the contents oflegal accountsshould 
be subject to the severance principle. 


The Assistant Commissioner then went 
on to adopt the test set out in Order 
M-213 forthe treatment of these records. 
That is, fora legal account to qualify for 
exemption under section 12 of the Act, its 
contents must relate in a direct and tan- 
gible way to the seeking, formulating or 
provision of legal advice. 


The Assistant Commissioner explained 
that, from a practical perspective, that 
test will be satisfied where the disclosure 
of the information contained in the ac- 
count would reveal the subject(s) for 
which legal advice was sought, the strat- 
egy used to address the issues raised, the 
particulars of any legal advice provided or 
the outcome of these investigations. This 
approach reflects the fact that some infor- 
mation contained ina legal account may 
relate to the seeking, formulation or pro- 
vision of legal advice, but also allows the 
principle of severance to be applied to the 
record in a predictable fashion. 


The Assistant Commissioner then went 
on to review each of the legal accounts at 
issue. He noted that the accounts indi- 
vidually provide a tally of the hours spent 
and disbursements made by the law firms, 
as well as brief narratives of the steps 
taken to complete the assignments. In his 
view, the disclosure of the information 
contained in some of these accounts 
would neither reveal the subjects for which 
legal advice was sought, the legal advice 


14 


provided, the legal strategy pursued, nor 
the results obtained. On this basis, these 
legal accounts do notcontain information 
which relates in a direct and tangible way 
to the seeking, formulating or provision 
of legal advice. The result is that these 
records are not protected from disclosure 
under the section 19 exemption. 


The Assistant Commissioner also found, 
however, that portions of the narratives 
set out in the other legal accounts at issue 
would reveal this type of information. 
On this basis, he found that the disclo- 
sure of these excerpts were subject to 
exemption under Branch 1 of the section 
19 exemption.

The Welland County Roman Catholic 

Separate School Board (the Board) re- 

ceived a request under the Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act(the Act) for access toa number 

of records held by the Board. The 

requester indicated that the records 

contained information about an indivi- 

dual, now deceased, who had been an 

employee of the Board (the deceased). 

The request was fora number of different 

categories of records. 


- —_ ee <=

COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Attached to the request was a copy of the 
last will and testament of the deceased, 
appointing his wife as the sole executrix 
of his will. The requester indicated that 
he was authorized to request the infor- 
mation on behalf of the executrix. The 
requester provided the Board with an 
authorization to that effect, signed by the 
executrix. 


The Board’s decision letter granted ac- 
cess to certain records and denied access 
to others. In addition to addressing other 
items raised by the appellant’s request, it 
also stated that certain records did not 
relate to the administration of the estate 
and, therefore, section 54(a) of the Act 
did not provide the requester with a right 
of access to these documents. 


ORDER 
The Board’s decision was upheld. 


The Board, in its submissions, explained 
that the information which has been 
released to the appellant, including the 
personal file of the deceased, was infor- 
~ mation which related to the estate of the 
deceased. This included information 
concerning such things as entitlement to 
death benefits, life insurance and vaca- 
tion pay. It refused to disclose the 
remaining records at issue on the basis 
that the records do not relate to the 
administration of the individual’s estate. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg noted that it is 
clear from the wording of section 54(a) 
that for a personal representative of a 
deceased to exercise a right or power of 
the deceased, the exercise of that right or 
power must “relate to the administration 
of the individual’s estate”. Asa result, the 
rights of a personal representative under 
section 54(a) are narrower than the rights 
of the deceased person. That is, the de- 


ceased will retain his or her right to 


privacy except insofar as the administra- 
tion of his or her estate is concerned. 


In order to give effect to these rights, 
Inquiry Officer Fineberg stated that the 
phrase “relates to the administration of 
the individual’s estate” in section 54(a) 
should be interpreted narrowly to in- 
clude records relating to financial matters 
to which the personal representative re- 
quires access in order to wind up the 
estate. She found that the records at issue 
in this appeal contained precisely the 
type of sensitive personal information 
about the deceased which the other 
sections of the Act were designed to pro- 
tect, and that the personal information at 
issue did not relate to the administration 
of the deceased’s estate.

Institution: Kingston Police Services Board 
NOVEMBER 19, 1993 

(ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GLASBERG) 


KEYWORDS 


fees * fee waiver * public health or safety 
* financial hardship 


The Kingston Police Services Board (the 
Police) received a request under the 
Municipal Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (the Act) for a 
large number of records of different types. 


The appellant subsequently narrowed 
several aspects of his request. 


Following receipt of this revised request, 
the Police issued a decision letter which 
indicated that access to some of the records 
requested would likely be denied under 
sections 8(1)(c) and (i) of the Act. The 
Police also provided the requester with a 
fee estimate of $2,250, representing the 
time that it would take them to search for 
and prepare the relevant records pursu- 
ant to section 45(1)(a) of the Act. The 
Police also advised the requester of his 
right to request a waiver of the fees. 


One of the grounds for which the re- 
quester sought a fee waiver was that such 
payment would cause financial hardship 
to him under section 45(4)(c) of the Act. 
The Police made the decision not to 
waive the fee and the requester appealed 


this decision to the Office of the 
Commissioner. 


ORDER 
The institution’s decision was upheld. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg 
initially pointed out that a number of 
previous orders had established that the 
person requesting a fee waiver has the 


responsibility of providing adequate 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


evidence to support a claim that such a 
waiver is appropriate (Orders P-476 and 
M-166). 


In his representations, the appellant had 
provided evidence that he had a modest 
income and that his monthly expenses 
were also modest. The appellant did not, 
however, supply any evidence to the 
Police or the Office of the Commissioner 
respecting his asset holdings or his net 
worth. The Assistant Commissioner 
noted that without this type of infor- 
mation, it is not possible to determine 
whether the appellant has the financial 
resources to pay the fee for which he is 
requesting a waiver. For the purposes of 
this appeal, however, he was prepared to 
assume, without deciding the matter, 
that an expenditure of $2,250 to obtain 
the records in question would cause a 


financial hardship to this appellant. 


Having made this initial assumption, the 
Assistant Commissioner was then re- 
quired to determine whether it was fair 
and equitable for the Police not to have 
waived payment of the fee in this particu- 
lar case. In Order P-463, the Assistant 
Commissioner set out a number of fac- 
tors to be considered in resolving these 
sorts of cases. These factors were: (1) the 
manner in which the institution at- 
tempted to respond to the appellant’s 
request; (2) whether the institution 
worked with the appellant to narrow 
and/or clarify the request; and (3) whether 
the institution provided any documenta- 
tion to the requester free of charge. In 
Order P-474, he added a fourth consid- 
eration: whether the appellant worked 
constructively with the institution to 
narrow the scope of the request. 


The Assistant Commissioner noted that 
in Order M-166, Inquiry Officer Seife 
added several additional factors to this 
list. These included: (1) whether the 


request involves a very large volume of 


records; (2) whether or not the appellant 
has advanced a compromise solution 
which would reduce the costs of process- 
ing the request; and (3) whether the 
waiver of the fee would shift an un- 
reasonable burden of the cost of access 
from the appellant to the institution such 
that there would occur a significant 
interference with the operations of the 
institution. 


The Assistant Commissioner then re- 
flected on the applicability of these con- 
siderations to the facts of this appeal. He 
noted that the scope of the original 
request was massive, both in terms of the 
subject areas addressed and the time pe- 
riods over which information was sought. 
He then went on to state that while it is 
true that, at the suggestion of the Police, 
the appellant clarified and/or narrowed 
his request somewhat, what remained 
was still a diffuse and very broad applica- 
tion for information. On this basis, the 
Assistant Commissioner was unable to 
conclude that the appellant had worked 
constructively with the Police to mean- 
ingfully narrow the scope of the request. 
Based on his review of the file, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner also concluded that 
the Police attempted to deal with the 
appellant’s request in a constructive and 
responsible fashion. 


For these reasons, the Assistant Commis- 
stoner found that this was not the kind of 
case where it would be appropriate to 
shift the cost of processing an access 
request from the requester to the institu- 
tion, and that the decision of the Police 
not to waive the $2,250 fee was based on 
fair and equitable grounds and, there- 
fore, proper in the circumstances of this 


appeal.

management agreement * meeting ® in

The City of North York (the City) re- 

ceived a request under the Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act (the Act) for access to a copy 

of the management agreement between 

the North York Performing Arts Centre 

Corporation (the Corporation) and the 

Live Entertainment Corporation of 
Canada (the affected party) for the opera- 

tion of the North York Performing Arts 

Centre. The Corporation was established 

pursuant to the City of North York Act. 

All of the members of the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation are “ap- 

pointed by or under the authority of 
the Council of the City of North York”, 

and so, for the purposes of the Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection 

of Privacy Act, the Corporation is 

deemed to be “a part of the municipal 

corporation”. 


The City denied access to the record 
pursuant to sections 6(1)(b), 8(1)(), 


10(1)(a), 10(1)(b), 10(1)(c), 11 (a), 11(0), 
11(d), 11(f) and 12 of the Act. 


Mediation was not successful and notice 
that an inquiry was being conducted to 
review the City’s decision was sent to the 
City, the appellant and the affected party. 
Representations were received from all 
parties. In its representations, the City 
stated that it was no longer relying upon 
the exemption contained in section 12 of 


the Act. 


ORDER 
The decision of the City was upheld. 


The record at issue in this appeal was a 
58-page management agreement and 12 
schedules which were appended thereto. 


In order to rely on section 6(1)(b), the 
City must establish that: 


1. A meeting of a council, board, commis- 
sion or other body or a committee of one of 


them took place; and 


2. A statute authorizes the holding of such 
a meeting in the absence of the public; and 


3. The disclosure of the record at issue 
would reveal the actual substance of the 
deliberations of this meeting. 


[Orders M-64, M-98, M-102 and 
M-219] 


Inquiry Officer Hale adopted the defini- 
tion of the words “substance” and “delib- 
erations” expressed by Assistant Commis- 
sioner Glasberg in Orders M-184 and 
M-196. 


In Order M-196, Assistant Commis- 
sioner Glasberg considered the meaning 
of the words “substance” and “delibera- 
tions” in the context of the interpretation 
of section 6(1)(b) of the Act. He held as 


follows: 


19 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 8th 
edition, defines “substance” as the “theme 
or subject” of a thing. Having reviewed the 
contents of the agreement and the represen- 
tations provided to me, itis my view that the 
“theme or subject” of the in camera meeting 
was whether the terms of the retirement 
agreement were appropriate and whether 


they should be endorsed. 


In Order M-184, which involved a re- 
quest for an early retirement agreement, 
Assistant Commissioner Glasberg had 
occasion to interpret the term “delibera- 
tions”, which is also found in section 


6(1)(b) of the Act. He stated: 


... Inmy view, deliberations, in the context 
of section 6(1)(b), refer to discussions which 
were conducted with a view towards mak- 
ing a decision. Having carefully reviewed 
the contents of the Minutes of Settlement, I 
am satisfied that the disclosure of this docu- 
ment would reveal the actual substance of 
the discussions conducted by the Board, 
hence its deliberations, or would permit the 
drawing of accurate inferences about the 
substance of those discussions ... 


Inquiry Officer Hale found that all three 
components of the test had been satis- 
fied, and that the management agree- 
ment was properly exempt from disclo- 
sure under section 6(1)(b) of the Acz. In 
addition, Inquiry Officer Hale was un- 
able to find that the subject matter of 
Council’s deliberationson May 30, 1990 
related to a sufficient degree to the sub- 
ject matter of Council’s deliberations on 
May 29, 1991. Therefore, the exception 
provided by section 6(2)(b) of the Act 
did notapply to the management agree- 
ment which was the subject of this 


appeal.

The Metropolitan Separate School Board 
(the Board) received a request under the 
Municipal Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (the Act) for a 
copy of the expense account sheets, in- 
cluding attachments and receipts, and 
thecreditcard statements forseven named 
employees of the Board, covering various 
specified time periods. 


ORDER 


The Board was ordered to disclose the 
records. 


$B 


The records consisted of the computer 
print-outs, bills and receipts of thenamed 
employees of the Board. The appellant 
had stated that he is only pursuing access 
to expenses incurred while the indivi- 
duals were engaged in Board activity for 
which claims were later made. He was 
not seeking access to the actual credit 
card numbers. Consequently, the credit 
card numbers were not at issue. 


The Board submitted in its representa- 
tions that sections 1 1(c) and (d) of the Act 
“might” apply to some of the infor- 
mation contained in the records. These 
sections are discretionary exemptions. 
The Board did not cite these sections in 
its decision letter to the appellant as the 
basis for exempting any of the records 
and only raised them in its representa- 
tions by stating that the sections “might” 
apply. As a result, Inquiry Officer Big 
Canoe did not address these sections in 
this order. 


After having carefully reviewed the sam- 
ple records as well as the representations 
provided to her, the Inquiry Officer did 
not find any information to satisfy her 
that the information contained in the 
records relates to “personal expenses”. 
Therefore, it was her opinion that the 
records at issue relate to expenses in- 
curred by employees of the Board in their 
employment capacity and were not the 
personal information of the employees 


for the purposes of the Act. 


In a postscript to her order, Inquiry 
Officer Big Canoe pointed out that in 
two of these appeals, the subject of the 
request was also the person who made 
the decision to deny access to the records. 
She indicated that while there may not 
have been an actual conflict of interest 
present in these particular appeals, she 
recommends that a delegation of the 
head’s powers under the Act contem- 
plate the possibility of conflict of interest 


scenarios, whether real or perceived, and 
provide for alternate decision makers in 
those instances.

The complainant had requested that the 
Board review a decision that the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario 
(the College) had made regarding her 
complaints about ten doctors. When she 
requested the review, she stated: “I would 
like to have full disclosure of all data 
considered by the College and also infor- 
mation from the Investigator to justify 
their conclusion”. 


The Board released a file of about 200 
documents to the complainant, but also 
released the same information to the 
doctors’ agent. The file included copies 
of correspondence to and from the com- 
plainant on the subject ofher complaints 
about the doctors, and portions of her 
medical records. It also included copies 
of correspondence that had been for- 
warded to the College from the Office of 
the Police Complaints Commissioner. 
This correspondence included a letter 
the complainant had written toa Chief 
of Police, concerning her complaints 
about the doctors and complaints about 
police officers. 


24 


When the review ofhercomplaintsagainst 
the doctors was held, the complainant 
noted that everyone who attended had 
been given a copy of the above docu- 
ments. She believed that her privacy had 
been breached by the disclosure of her 
information to the doctors and their 
agent, and possibly others, who had at- 
tended the review. She believed that her 
medical records in the file might have 
been removed from the review room and 
subsequently used by the doctors in some 
way. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the complainant’s 
personal information had been disclosed 
in accordance with section 42(c) of the 
Act, for the purpose for which it had 
been obtained, which was to conduct the 
review. 


The IPC found no evidence to show that 
individuals who were not parties to the 
review had attended, and no evidence 
that copies of the file had been removed 
from the review room, other than for 
storage or shredding.

claims representative. The information 
was contained in a Non Economic Loss 
Assessment and covering letter, (the 
NEL), prepared by a physician for the 
WCB. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that in order to 
properly make an NEL assessment, and 
to fairly determine the amount of com- 
pensation due to the complainant, it had 
been necessary for the WCB to collect 
information about the complainant's 
private life. The IPC concluded that the 
WCB’s collection had been necessary to 
the proper administration of a lawfully 
authorized activity, and had therefore 
been in accordance with section 38(2) of 


the Act. 


The IPC determined that the WCB had 
disclosed the complainant’s personal 
information to the employer in compli- 
ance with section 42(12) of the Workers’ 
Compensation Act, which requires the 
WCB to send a copy of the NEL to the 
employer. The IPC concluded that the 
WCB’s disclosure was for the purpose of 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


complying with an Act of the Legislature 
and was, thus, in accordance with section 


42(e) of the Act. 


The IPC found that the complainant’s 
personal information had been disclosed 
to her former claims representative in 
error because the change in representa- 
tives had not been updated in the com- 
puter ina timely fashion. The IPC deter- 
mined that this disclosure was not in 
accordance with any provisions of sec- 


tion 42 of the Act. 


The IPC also noted that the WCB did 
not use confidential envelopes when 
mailing NELs to employers; thus sensi- 
tive personal information might be viewed 
unnecessarily by other staff — for exam- 


- ple, by those responsible for opening 


mail. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that: (1) the 
WCB take steps to ensure that adjudica- 
tors update the information in their 
computers as soon as they are notified of 
a change of claims representative; and (2) 
the WCB use confidential envelopes 
when mailing out medical information 
to employers. The envelopes should be 
addressed to a named officer, or a 
generic title should be used — for 
example, “WCB Claims Administrator’.

An employee of one of the Ministry’s 


psychiatric hospitals (the Hospital), had » 


requested employment accommodation 
under the Ministry's employment equity 
program. During the course of arranging 
the employee’s accommodation needs, 
the employee’s supervisor, the Director 
of Psychology, disclosed the employee's 
medical diagnosis to: the Hospital’s 
Director of Materials Management, the 
Assistant Administrator, the Employ- 
ment Equity Advisor, and staff of the 


Personnel department. 


The Hospital stated that it had relied on 
section 42(d) of the Act for the disclo- 
sures. Each of the employees to whom 
the complainant’s personal information 
had been disclosed needed the infor- 
mation in the performance of his or her 
duties, and the disclosures were necessary 
and proper to the discharge of the Hos- 
pital’s functions. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC was of the view that providing 
for the accommodation needs of an em- 
ployee under the employment equity 
program was an administrative function 


of the Hospital. 


The IPC found that the Assistant Ad- 
ministrator needed the complainant's 
personal information for the purpose of 
ensuring that her accommodation needs 
were met. Therefore, the IPC concluded 
that the disclosure of the complainant’s 
personal information was to an officer 
who needed the information in the per- 
formance of his duties, and the disclosure 
was necessary and proper in the discharge 
of one of the Hospital’s administrative 
functions. The disclosure was, thus, in 
accordance with section 42(d) of the Act. 


However, the IPC found that the Direc- 
tor of Materials Management did not 
need to know the complainant s personal 
inforrhation in order to purchase equip- 


ment which had already been identified; 
the staff of the Personnel department did 
not need this personal information in 
order to support the complainant’s ac- 
commodation needs or to maintain their 
records; the Employment Equity Advi- 
sor did not need the personal infor- 
mation since she was not, at that time, 
advocating for the complainant’s accom- 
modation needs. The IPC concluded, 
therefore, that these disclosures were not 
to officers who needed the complainant's 
personal information in the performance 
of their duties. The disclosures were not, 
thus, in accordance with section 42(d) of 
the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try take steps to ensure that hospital staff 
are aware of the limited purposes for 
which the disclosure of personal infor- 
mation is permitted under the Act. The 
IPC also recommended that the Minis- 
try establish a guideline which sets out 
the steps to be taken by hospital staff 
when processing an application for 
employee accommodation under the 
employmentequity program. This guide- 
line should clearly set out to whom an 
applicant’s personal medical information 
may be disclosed.

ter system that was accessible by other 
employees, who did not require access to 
this information. He was also concerned 
that pay stubs were being distributed in 
an unsecured manner in unsealed enve- 
lopes, and that employee time sheet print- 
outs showing employees’ Social Insur- 
ance Numbers (SINs) were being sent to 
departments in an unsecured manner. 
Healso stated that time sheets were being 
left on desks where they could be read by 


anyone passing by. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that pay cheques/pay 
stubs were being distributed to em- 
ployees through their supervisors or del- 
egates, in unsealed envelopes. However, 
during the course of our investigation, 
the hospital initiated new procedures 
which required all staff to pick up their 
own pay cheques/pay stubs personally 
from the hospital’s business office. 


The IPC found that computer printouts 
of employees’ time sheets with the SIN 
were being sent to head nurses, supervi- 
sors, department heads and other man- 
agers in order to complete information 
on time worked. The completed time 
sheets were then returned to the hospi- 
tal’s payroll department where the pay- 
roll staff would key the data into the 
computer. 


The Ministry stated that it had relied on 
section 42(d) of the Act for the disclo- 
sure of employees’ SIN, since officers or 
employees of the institution needed this 
information in the performance of their 
duties. However, it was the IPC’s view 
that only the staff in the payroll depart- 
ment who required the SIN to key data 
into the computer for payroll entry 
needed this information in the perform- 
ance of their duties. The disclosure of 
employees’ SIN to staff in other depart- 
ments was found not to be in accord- 
ance with section 42(d). 


26 


The IPC found that the computer print- 
outs of time sheets were being distributed 
and returned in sealed envelopes and that 
the hospital’s procedures required the 
responsible individuals to ensure that 
time sheets were not left on their desks in 
a way which allowed others to read them. 
However, the Ministry acknowledged 
that some individuals may not have been 
following these procedures. 


The IPC also found that employee-re- 
lated injured worker information, in- 
cluding Workers’ Compensation Board 
claims, was contained in a stand-alone 
personal computer that was distinct from 
the hospital’s computer system, which 
contained regular patient information. 
Employees who had sought counselling 
and assistance from doctors at the hospi- 
tal were treated as regular patients. Their 
medical files and related documents, 
however, were kept separately and se- 
curely. The hospital had also taken meas- 
ures to ensure that these employees could 
not be identified in the hospital’s compu- 
terized records. Their real names were 
not used and their addresses, SINs and 
health card numbers were recorded as 
“unknown”. The key to their real identi- 
ties was kept securely, with very limited 
ACCESS. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try: (1) seek an alternative method for 
collecting information on employees’ 
time worked — one that would not 
involve the disclosure of employees’ SIN 
to staff of departments, other than the 
Payroll department; and (2) remind staff 
of their obligation to follow the hospital’s 
procedures at all times with respect to the 
security of personal information con- 
tained in the computer printouts of time 
sheets.

An employee of one of the Ministry’s

been required to provide a medical cer- 
tificate to the Hospital after being absent 
from work. The medical certificate, con- 
taining thecomplainant’s name, the name 
and address ofher physician, and the date 
and reason for her absence, i.e. “medi- 
cal”, was then disclosed to the Hospital’s 
Assistant Administrator, Patient Services 
(the Assistant Administrator), the Re- 
gional Human Resources Administrator 
(the HR Administrator), and one of the 
Ministry’s legal counsel. 


The Hospital stated that it had relied on 
section 42(d) of the Act for the disclo- 
sures. Each of the employees to whom 
the complainant’s personal information 
had been disclosed needed the infor- 
mation in the performance of his or her 
duties, and the disclosures were necessary 
and proper to the discharge of the Hos- 
pital’s functions. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC was of the view that verifying an 
employee’s absence from work by re- 
questing an employee's medical certifi- 
cate was an administrative function of 


the Hospital. 


The IPC found that of the personal 
information on the medical certificate, 
the complainant’s name and the date and 
reason for her absence from work, i.e. 
“medical”, was needed by the Assistant 
Administrator and the HR Administra- 
tor in the performance of their duties of 
verifying the reason for the complain- 
ant’s absence. The disclosures of this

personal information were, thus, in ac- 
cordance with section 42(d) of the Act. 
However, at the time of disclosure, the 
legal counsel did not need this personal 
information in the performance of her 
duties and, therefore, the disclosure to 
her was not in accordance with section 


42(d) of the Act. 


The IPC also found that the complain- 
ant’s physician’s name and address were 
not needed by the Assistant Administra- 
tor, the HR Administrator, and the legal 
counsel in the performance of their du- 
ties and, therefore, the disclosures of this 
personal information were not in accord- 


ance with section 42(d) of the Acz. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try take steps to ensure: (1) that all Hos- 
pital staff are aware of the limited pur- 
poses for which the disclosure of personal 
information is permitted under the Act 
and (2) all Hospital staff, including man- 
agement, are aware of the circumstances 
under which personal information con- 
tained in an employee's medical certifi- 
cate may be released, further to the Hos- 
pital’s revised policy on the confidential- 
ity of employee health records.

The Ministry had conducted an investi- 
gation under the Environmental Protec- 
tion Act into the activities of some em- 
ployees of an incorporated company 


which had resulted in charges being laid 
against the complainant. The Ministry 
had then disclosed — in a Ministry 
publication — details about the com- 
plainant’s conviction and the amount he 
was said to have been fined. The com- 
plainant was concerned about the 
disclosure of his personal information 
and about the accuracy of the personal 
information disclosed. 


CONCLUSION 

It was the Ministry’s position that the 
information disclosed was not the com- 
plainant’s personal information since he 
had been charged as a result of employ- 
ment-related rather than private activi- 
ties. The IPC determined that the 
complainant had been convicted and 
ordered by the court to make restitution. 
It was the IPC’s view that since the 
information disclosed was about an 
identifiable individual, it was thus, 
personal information. 


The Ministry submitted that the charges 
against the complainant had been dealt 
with by the court where information 
about the complainant’s activities had 
been placed on the record, and had, 
therefore, become available to the public. 
The Ministry stated that it had merely 
reflected information that was already 
available to the public in order to inform 
the public of its enforcement activities 
and to serve as a deterrent to would-be 
polluters. The IPC examined the appli- 
cation of section 37, which provides that 
personal information that is “maintained 
for the purpose of creating a record that 
is available to the general public” is not 
subject to Part II of the Act. However, 
it was our view that the Ministry could 
not have been said to be maintaining the 
complainant’s personal information 
specifically for the purpose of creating a 
record available to the general public. 
Therefore, section 37 of the Act did not 


apply. 


The IPC determined that the complain- 
ant’s personal information had originated 
from proceedings conducted in court 
which are, except in the most exceptional 
circumstances, open to the public. This 
serves the dual purpose of informing the 
public of judicial proceedings, as well as 
acting as a deterrent to potential offend- 
ers. It was the IPC’s view that the Minis- 
try had disclosed the complainant’s 
information for substantially similar 
purposes: namely, to inform the public 
of its enforcement activities and to deter 
would-be polluters. It was our view that 
the Ministry’s disclosure was for a pur- 
pose that was reasonably compatible with 
the purpose for which the personal infor- 
mation had originally been compiled by 
the court. The disclosure was thus for a 
consistent purpose, in accordance with 
section 42(c) of the Act. 


The Ministry acknowledged that the 
information disclosed had not been en- 
tirely accurate and had responded to the 
complainant’s request for correction un- 


der section 47(2) of the Act.

The complainant had been ordered by 
the Court to make support payments to 
his ex-wife through the Family Support 
Plan (the FSP). He believed that the FSP 
had provided his ex-wife with a copy of 
the general ledger record of his FSP 
account, and that its staff had provided

her with details of his payments. He 
believed that, although his ex-wife had 
the right to know the status of the ac- 
count, she had no right to know the 
specifics of his payments, and that disclo- 
sure of this information to her was not in 
compliance with the Act. The complain- 
ant was also concerned that the infor- 
mation itself had not been accurate. 


CONCLUSION 

The FSP raised the issue of whether 
section 37 applied in the circumstances 
of this case. The IPC found that the 
complainant’s personal information in 
the general ledger record would not have 
been maintained by the FSP for the 
purpose of making that information avail- 
able to the general public. Therefore, the 
FSP could not rely on section 37 to 
exempt the general ledger record from 
the privacy provisions of the Act. 


The IPC concluded that the complain- 
ant’s personal information had been dis- 
closed in accordance with section 42(c) 
of the Act, for a consistent purpose. The 
FSP’s purpose for disclosing the infor- 
mation to the ex-wife (i.e., to provide her 
with an explanation of how the pay- 
ments had been made) was reasonably 
compatible with the purpose for which 
the FSP had obtained the information — 
to enforce the court order on behalf of 
the ex-wife. 


With respect to the accuracy of the per- 
sonal information, the complainant was 
advised of his right under section 47(2) 
of the Act to request correction of his 
personal information,

Three individuals complained separately 
about the disclosure of their personal 
information by the Ministry to the On- 
tario Breast Screening Program (OBSP). 


Each woman had received a letter from 
the OBSP suggesting that, since she was 
“ofa certain age”, she should be aware of 
certain facts about health risks. In addi- 
tion, each woman was advised: “Your 
name was selected in a confidential man- 
ner using your Health Number and your 


» 


age . 


CONCLUSION 

The OBSP had asked the Ministry to 
conduct a mailing to women between 
the ages of 50 and 69, to make them 
aware of and invite them to participate in 
local breast screening clinics. The Minis- 
try had set up a “confidentiality agree- 
ment’ with Canada Post to conduct the 
mailing from a listing provided by the 
Ministry. The listing given to Canada 
Post consisted of the names and ad- 
dresses of women who were between the 


ages of 50 and 69. 


The OBSP had also provided a form 
letter to Canada Post which did not 
contain any personal information. 
Canada Post then conducted a “mail 
merge” — the names and addresses from 
the listing were inserted onto the form 
letters provided by the OBSP. Canada 
Post then sent one of these letters to each 


of the targeted individuals. 


The IPC determined that no personal 


information had been disclosed directly 


to the OBSP. Unless the targeted indivi- 
dual contacted the clinic, the OBSP would 
not be aware that she had received the 
letter. The health number was not dis- 
closed to either the OBSP or to Canada 
Post. 


The Ministry stated that it had relied on _ 


section 42(c) for the disclosure of per- 
sonal information to Canada Post, i.e., 
the disclosure was for a consistent pur- 
pose. The Ministry had collected the 
personal information in question on the 
Registered Persons Database for the 
purposes of “health planning and co- 
ordination”. It was the our view that 
“health promotion” was compatible with 
health planning and co-ordination. In 
“promoting health”, the Ministry dis- 
closed the personal information to 
Canada Post so that the OBSP letter 
could be sent to the targeted individuals 
(including the complainants). It was our 
view that these individuals could have 
reasonably expected such a disclosure of 
their personal information. Thus, the 
disclosure was for a consistent purpose, 
in accordance with section 42(c) of the 


Act. 


The IPC, however, found that while the 
Ministry had set up the confidentiality 
agreement with Canada Post to conduct 
the mailing, and had sent a letter to 
Canada Post stating that the agreement 
was acceptable, it had not yet signed the 
agreement — only Canada Post and 


OBSP had signed. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try sign the confidentiality agreement, 
since it had custody and control of the 
personal information.

of different levels. Unfortunately, in this 
instance the wrong information had 
been inadvertently disclosed by the

Effective January 1, 1993, self-employed 
individuals in the province of Ontario 
who earned a net income of more than 
$40,000 were required to pay the Em- 
ployer Health Tax (EHT). Priorto 1993, 
self-employed individuals were only re- 
quired to pay this tax on behalf of their 
employees. 


In order to register for the EHT, self- 
employed individuals were required to 
complete a registration form. The com- 
plainant, a self-employed individual, 
objected to the collection of his Social 
Insurance Number (SIN) on the regis- 
tration form. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the Ministry 
collected the SIN for the administration 
and enforcement of the EHT. EHT staff 
required the SIN in order to verify a 
client’s identity when they responded to 
account related inquiries or to questions 
regarding interpretation. EHT staff also 
required the SIN for auditing and other 
verification functions. In addition to 
verifying information received from 
self-employed individuals, the SIN was 
necessary to facilitate the exchange of 
tax information with Revenue Canada, 
under existing exchange of information 
agreements. | 


It was the IPC’s view that the Ministry’s 
administration and enforcement of the 
EHT wasa “lawfully authorized activity” 
and that the collection of the SIN was 
necessary to the proper administration of 
this activity. The Ministry’s collection of 
the SIN was, therefore, in accordance 
with section 38(2) of the Act.

Former employees of this company then 
raised certain issues concerning their par-

ner in which their complaints had been 
handled at the local broker level. The 
Ministry conducted an investigation of 
these issues during which an employee of 
the Ministry collected and disclosed the 
complainant’s personal information to 
other Ministry employees. 


The Ministry employees involved in both 
the collection and disclosure of the com-

their obligations under the Act and the 
limited purposes for which personal infor- 
mation may be collected and disclosed

The Ministry had identified the com-

Allowance (FBA) who might also be 
eligible for Canada Pension Plan (CPP) 
disability benefits. The Ministry pro- 
vided the complainant with a CPP “kit”

and two forms; both the kit and forms 
were to be completed and returned to the 
Ministry where staff would review and 
forward them to Health and Welfare 
Canada (HWC). However, in this case, 
the kit and forms were lost. The com- 
plainant obtained a replacementkit from 
HWC, but without the forms. The Min- 
istry provided the complainant with two 
blank forms to be signed and returned to 
the Ministry. 


The complainant contended that she 
should not have been required to sign 
blank forms. She also complained about 
having to return the forms to the Minis- 
try and not directly to HWC. She ques- 
tioned who had access to the forms at the 
Ministry. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the forms provided 
to the complainant should have been 
filled in first by Ministry staff with infor- 
mation found in her Family Benefits file. 
It was not the normal practice of the 
Ministry to ask clients to sign blank 
forms. 


The Ministry advised that verbal and 
written directions would be issued to all 
staff in the relevant areas, stating that 
under no circumstances were clients to 
be requested to sign blank or incomplete 
forms. 


The IPC found that the Ministry re- 
quired completed forms to be returned 
to its offices so that its staff could review 
them for completeness and accuracy 
before they were forwarded to HWC, 
and to ensure that applications were 
processed without delay. However, had 
the complainant asked to send her 
information directly to HWC, her re- 
quest would have been considered by 
the Ministry. 


The IPC found that the Ministry did not 
keep copies of the kits or forms, but 
forwarded them directly to HWC. A 
notation was made on the client’s Family 


Benefits file that an application had been 
made for CPP.

that while it did not havea policy on how 
professors should be maintaining these 
notes, faculty members at regional meet-

was the IPC’s view, however, that reason-

The complainant had filed a complaint 
with the Ontario Provincial Police (the 
Police) concerning certain members of 
the Township’s Council. The Police had 
conducted an investigation but no 
charges had been laid. The Township 
had then requested a copy of the General 
Occurrence Report (the report) from the 
Police. According to the complainant, 
the Township was selling the report to 
the public at 25 cents a copy. 


The complainant contended that the 
Township’s disclosure of his personal 
information in this way was contrary to 


the Act. 


CONCLUSION 
The Township stated that it had relied on 
section 32(e) of the Actfor the disclosure 


of the report. Once the report was re- 
ceived as correspondence, it became a 
Township record and therefore could be 
disclosed under section 74 of the Munici- 
pal Act. The disclosure was for the pur- 
pose of complying with an Act of the 
Legislature and was thus, in accordance 
with section 32(e) of the Act. 


The IPC determined that section 74(1) 
of the Municipal Act had been amended 
in 1992 to read that the section was 
subject to the Act. Itwas our view that the 
Township had thus been required to 
determine if any provisions of section 
32 applied before disclosing records 
containing personal information under 
section 74(1) of the Municipal Act. Since 
the Township had not done so in this 
case, its disclosure of the report was 
not in accordance with section 74(1) of 
the Municipal Act and was not thus, in 
accordance with section 32(e) of the Act. 


The Township also stated that its disclo- 
sure was in accordance with section 32(c). 
The Township had obtained the report 
in order to determine the status of the 
police investigation and to complete its 
records. It was the IPC’s view that the 
Township’s disclosure of the complain- 
ant’s personal information was neither 
for the purpose for which it had been 
obtained nor for a consistent purpose. 
Therefore the Township’s disclosure was 
not in accordance with section 32.

ship establish written procedures to 
ensure that records which contained 
personal information are disclosed only 
in accordance with the Act.

The complainant had made two free- 
dom of information (FOI) requests to 
the Board of Commissioners of Police 
(the Board). One was a request for access 
to his own personal information. The 
other was an extensive request for access 
to general records. When he received the 
records containing his own personal 
information, the complainant found 
that another police force, to whom he 
had made a similar extensive general 
records request, had faxed the Board a 
copy of correspondence related to his fee 
estimate for the request. The com- 
plainant believed that the collection of 
this information by the Board had 
breached the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the complain- 
ant’s personal information had been 
collected by the Board for two purposes: 
to administer the FOI request for general 
records, and to pursue an investigation 
into whether a charge of mischief might 
be laid against the complainant, in con- 
junction with his general FOI request. 


The IPC concluded that, in the circum- 
stances of this case, the Board’s collection 
ofthecomplainant’s personal information 
for the purpose of administering the FOI 
request had been in accordance with 
section 28(2) of the Act, since the collec-

administration of the lawfully author-

ant’s FOI request.

purpose of law enforcement. 


The IPC also concluded that the Board’s 
collection had been in accordance with 
sections 29(1)(b) and (g). These sections

CONCLUSION 

The IPC found no evidence that the

her two access requests in two envelopes. 


Inside one envelope was a letter to the 
Director of Education referring to her 
access requests. This letter had been signed 
by the complainant and had contained 
her firstname in full. The lawyer who was 
the Board’s Acting Information and

concluded from this letter, that the 
complainant’s name was that ofa woman 
and had, accordingly, addressed her as 
“Ms” in his reply. 


The IPC found that the Board’s disclo-

with section 32(c) of the Act. The Board 
had collected the complainant's personal 
information in order to process her access

documentation from the Municipality 
relevantto thecomplainant’s WCB claim. 
In reply, the Municipality sent them 
copies of the complainant’s WCB records. 
The complainant contended that the 
Municipality’s disclosure of his WCB 
records to its insurance company was 
contrary to the Act. 


CONCLUSION 
The Municipality stated that it had relied 
on section 32 of the Act for the disclo- 
sure of the complainant’s personal infor- 
mation. The IPC determined that one of 
the purposes for which the Municipality 
obtained the complainant’s WCB claim 
was for WCB claims management. How- 
ever, the Municipality’s disclosure of the 
complainants WCB information was 
not for this purpose but to assist the 
insurance company with its investigation 
in respect of the complainant’s suit for 
damages. The disclosure was not, there- 
fore, for the purpose for which the per- 
sonal information had been obtained. 
The IPC also determined that the disclo- 
sure was not for a purpose that was 
consistent with the purpose for which the 
personal information had been obtained. 
Thus, the Municipality's disclosure of 
the complainant’s personal information 
to its insurance company was not in 
accordance with section 32(c) of the Act. 


The IPC also noted that if the Munici- 
pality had not coincidentally been the 
complainant’s employer, it would not 
have been in custody and control of the 
complainant’s WCB records. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Mu- 
nicipality take steps to ensure that all 
disclosures of personal information are 
made in accordance with the Act, for 
example, by clarifying any existing 
guidelines or procedures regarding the 
disclosure of personal information.

considering which had been discussed in 
an in-camera meeting. The Board subse- 
quently reprimanded the complainant 
during one of its regular open meetings, 
for providing this information to the 
reporter. 


CONCLUSION 

It was the Board’s view that section 27 of 
the Act applied: the complainant had 
gone to the newspaper and had made this 
issue public; therefore any subsequent 
disclosure by the Board of the complain- 
ant’s reprimand would not have contra- 
vened the Act. However, the IPC 
concluded that the Board had not 
maintained the information concerning 
the complainant’s reprimand for the 
purpose of making that information 
available to the public. It was thus, our 
view that the Board could not rely on 
section 27 of the Act to exempt this 
personal information from the privacy 
provisions of the Act. 


The Board also stated that it had repri- 
manded the complainant in a public 
meeting in accordance with its policy 
entitled “Confidentiality of Infor- 
mation”. The Board submitted that it 
had to follow the policies already in place 
before the Actcame into effect. The IPC 
advised the Board that once the Act was 
implemented, institutions under the Act 


were required to comply with its provi- 
sions. Thus, any disclosure by the Board 
of personal information in its custody or 
under its control was required to be in 
compliance with the disclosure provi- 
sions of section 32 of the Act. The IPC 
concluded that in the circumstances of 
this case, the Board’s disclosure of the 
complainant’s personal information was 
not in accordance with section 32 of the 


Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Board 
take steps to ensure that disclosures of 
personal information are made in ac- 
cordance with the Act, for example, by 
amending or clarifying its policies 
accordingly.

An individual questioned the authority 
of a Municipality to collect his health 
card number when he had applied for 


general welfare assistance. 


CONCLUSION 

Every person who receives general 
welfare assistance is entitled to benefits 
under the Ontario Drug Benefits Pro- 
gram, and therefore, the Municipality 
requires his/her health card number. 
It is our view that the Municipality’s 
processing and approval of applications 
for general welfare assistance, which 
includes drug benefits, is a lawfully 
authorized activity and that the collec- 
tion of the health card number is neces- 
sary to this activity. Therefore, the

An individual complained that his em- 
ployer, a hydro electric commission, was 
disclosing its employees’ personal infor- 
mation on an attendance board located 
in a particular department. When an 
employee was not in the office, it was 
indicated on the board that he or she was 
off sick, on Workers’ Compensation 
Benefits, etc. The complainant believed 
that the Commission’s disclosure of such 
personal information was contrary to the 


Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The Commission acknowledged that this 
attendance board existed. It agreed to 
take corrective action with respect to the 
personal information disclosed, such that 
when employees were not in the depart- 
ment, the attendance board would only 
note that they were “not available”.

* pecuniary or other harm ° individual’s

The Ministry of the Solicitor General 
and Correctional Services (the Minis- 
try) received a request under the Free- 
dom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act (the Ac?) for all documents 


relating to an investigation of a senior 


Ministry employee. The basis for the 
investigation was an allegation that the 
senior Ministry employee had misused 


public funds. 


ORDER 

The Ministry was ordered to disclose the 
records, except for any identifying infor- 
mation, such as the names and positions 


of the affected persons. 


In issuing this decision, the Assistant 
Commissioner was called upon to de- 
cide: (1) whether the disclosure of the 
records would be desirable for the pur- 
pose of subjecting the activities of the 
Ministry to public scrutiny [section 
21(2)(a)]; and (2) whether the senior 
Ministry employee would be exposed 
unfairly to pecuniary or other harm 
should personal information found in 
the record be ordered disclosed [section 


21(2)()]. 


The Assistant Commissioner indicated 
previous orders have held that, to estab- 
lish the relevance of this provision, evi- 
dence must be provided to demonstrate 
that the activities of the institution have 
been publicly called into question, ne- 
cessitating disclosure of the personal 
information of the affected persons in 
order to subject the activities of the 
institution to public scrutiny. 


The Assistant Commissioner pointed 
out, however, that the records at issue in 
this appeal were created during a 
recessionary environment which has 
placed an unparalleled obligation on 
government agencies to ensure that tax 
dollars are spent wisely. He further ex- 
plained that it is reasonable to expect that 
investigation reports which are designed 
to respond to allegations of financial 
improprieties will inherently be subject 
to a high degree of public scrutiny. 


According to the Assistant Commis- 
sioner, in these situations, the evidentiary 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


threshold to establish that “the activities 
of a Ministry have been publicly called 
into question” should be modest in na- 
ture. That threshold, in turn, will be 
satisfied, where there is some evidence 
that a public interest has been expressed 
about the circumstances which led to the 
creation of the record. 


Based on the evidence before him and the 
approach outlined above, he found that 
the activities of the Ministry and of the 
senior Ministry employee had been pub- 
licly called into question and therefore, 
section 2 1(2)(a) was arelevant considera- 
tion which weighed in favour of releasing 
the records at issue. 


With respect to the application of section 
21(2)(i), the Assistant Commissioner 
accepted that in determining whether an 
employee’s reputation might be unfairly 
damaged by the release of such infor- 
mation, it is relevant to consider the 
outcome ofan investigation which judges 
the conduct of that individual. The 
Assistant Commissioner pointed. out, 
however, that in interpreting this provi- 
sion, it is also necessary to reflect on the 
nature of the allegations raised, the type 
of records at issue and the position 
occupied by the government employee 
whose conduct is being questioned. 


In arriving at his decision, the Assistant 
Commissioner took into account the 
position of the primary affected person 
and the expectation that such an indivi- 
dual would have, that expense claims 
would be carefully scrutinized. He then 
concluded that the release of an investi- 
gation report which probes the appropri- 
ateness of these expenditures cannot be 
said to unfairly damage that individual's 
reputation. As a result, section 21(2)(i) 
was not held to be a relevant considera- 
tion in determining whether the disclo- 
sure of the information would constitute 
an unjustified invasion of personal privacy. 


The Assistant Commissioner found that 
the release of the personal information 
contained in the records would not con- 
stitute an unjustified invasion of the per- 
sonal privacy of the affected persons. 
Because the Assistant Commissioner 
found that an adequate level of public 
scrutiny respecting the results of the in- 
vestigation could be achieved without 
disclosing the names or other identifying 
information of the affected persons, he 
ordered the Ministry to disclose the 
records to the appellant, subject to the 
severance ofany identifying information, 
such as the names or positions of the 
affected persons. .

The Ministry of the Attorney General 
(the Ministry) received a request under 
the Freedom of Information and Protec- 
tion of Privacy Act (the Act) for answers 
to certain questions relating to the re- 
quester’s arrest and to four subsequent 
attendances he made in court. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was upheld. 


The issue that had to be addressed was 
the appropriateness of requests being 
made to an institution in the form of 
questions and the extent of the institu- 
tion’s obligation in responding to such 
requests. Inquiry Officer Hale pointed 
out that Order 17 had previously can- 
vassed this issue. 


In Order 17, former Commissioner 
Linden quoted the Williams Report, 
“Public Government for Private People” 
(1980): 


On page 241 (Volume 2) of the report, the 
author addresses the question of to which 
kinds of information or documents access 


should be given: 
“A common feature of the freedom of infor- 


mation schemes in place in other jurisdic- 
tions is that the type of “information” to 
which access is given is material which is 
already recorded in the custody or control of 
the government institution. Thus, a right 
to “information” does not embrace the 
right to require the government institu- 
tion to provide an answer to a specific 


question; rather, it is generally inter- 


__ preted as requiring that access be given to 


an existing document on which infor- 
mation has been recorded. This is not to 
say, of course, that the government should 
feel no obligation to answer questions from 
the public. Indeed, as we have indicated in 
an earlier chapter [13], the government of 
Ontario has committed substantial resources 
to establishing citizen's inquiry services with 
this specific objective in view. It would be 
quite unworkable, however, to grant a 
legally binding right of access to anything 
other than information contained in exist- 


ing documents or records. [emphasis added] 


For obvious reasons, most freedom of infor- 
mation schemes broadly construe the con- 
cept of “document” or “record” to include 
the various physical forms in which infor- 
mation may be recorded and stored. Thus, 
the right of access normally extends to all 
printed materials, maps, photographs and 
information recorded on film or in compu- 
terized information systems”. 


Based on this report, Commissioner Linden ’s 
conclusion was that an individual's right of 
access to information under the Act relates 
to information already recorded, whatever 
its physical form. In the absence of existing 
recorded information, the Act does not 
require the creation of a new record. 


Inquiry Officer Hale adopted the view of 
Commissioner Linden, that an institu- 
tion is not required to create records in 
response to a request which is posed in 
the form of a question. He noted, how- 
ever, that when a request for personal 
information is received by an institution 
under the Act in the form of a series of 
questions, it is incumbent upon the insti- 
tution to seek clarification of the request 
under sections 24(2) and 48(2) of the 
Act. Inquiry Officer Hale was satisfied 
that, in the circumstances of this appeal, 
the Ministry has met this obligation fully. 
He found that the Ministry has taken all 


reasonable steps to clarify the nature of 


the appellant’s request and to provide 
him with access to all records which are 
responsive to the request as originally and 
subsequently framed.

The Pay Equity Commission (the Com- 
mission) received a request under the 
Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act (the Act) for access to infor- 
mation regarding the pay equity plans 
either completed or being formulated for 
the Ottawa Civic Hospital. 


ORDER 
The decision of the head was partially 
upheld. 


In issuing this decision, Inquiry Officer 
Big Canoe was called upon: (a) to decide 
whether the identity of the applicants, 
which appeared in the records entitled 
“Application for Review Services”, should 
be disclosed; and (b) whether the records 
at issue in the appeal came within section 


17(1)(d) of the Act. 


In deciding whether the identity of the 
applicants should be disclosed, Inquiry 
Officer Big Canoe considered section 


32(4) of the Pay Equity Act, which she 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


then held to be a confidentiality provi- 
sion which prevailed over this Act. She 
then concluded that, where applicants 
have indicated on an “Application for 
Review Services” document that they 
wish to remain anonymous, section 67 (2) 
of the Actapplies, and the identity of the 


applicant is not accessible under the Act. 


In interpreting the section 17(1)(d) ex- 
emption, Inquiry Officer Big Canoe had 
to interpret the scope of the term “labour 
relations information”, which is foundin 
this provision. She concluded that the 
words refer to information concerning 
the collective relationship between an 
employer and its employees. She then 
examined the information contained in 
the records and found them to be com- 
piled in the course of the negotiation of 
pay equity plans which, when imple- 
mented, would affect the collective rela- 
tionship between the employer and its 
employees. For this reason, she concluded 
that, with some exceptions, this infor- 
mation may properly be characterized as 
“labour relations information”. 


The Inquiry Officer then turned to the 
second part of the section 17(1)(d) test. 
She pointed out, thatin alabour relations 
context such as this, it is normally the 
practice that, where an impartial third 
party is performing services analogous to 
those of a mediator or conciliation of- 
ficer, any information supplied bya party 
is not disclosed without the consent of 
the party supplying the information. She 
found that the circumstances surround- 
ing the submission of most of the infor- 
mation contained in the records to be 
similar in nature to those relating to 
mediation or conciliation and, therefore, 
that an expectation of confidentiality 
existed concerning the information sup- 


plied by the parties. 


The final part of the test involved the 
Inquiry Officer deciding whether the 


information was supplied to “another 
person appointed to resolve a labour 
relations dispute”. She found that a Re- 
view Officer appointed under section 
34(1) of the Pay Equity Act may be 
considered “another person appointed 
to resolve a labour relations dispute” 
within the meaning of section 17(1)(d) 
of the Act. 


Accordingly, she found that all three 
parts of the section 17(1)(d) testhad been 


met, for the majority of records at issue.

The Ministry of the Attorney General 
(the Ministry) received a request under 
the Freedom of Information and Protec- 
tion of Privacy Act (the Act) for access to 
the complete investigation report into 
the activities of the Legal Services Branch 
of the Pension Commission of Ontario 


(the PCO). 


The Ministry disclosed portions of the 
record to the requester, but denied access 
to the balance of the document pursuant 
to the exemptions contained in sections 
13(1), 18(1)(), 2111) and 49(b) of the 
Act. The requester appealed the decision 
of the Ministry. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


Two pivotal issues were addressed in this 
appeal. First, whether the Office of the 
Commissioner had the authority to set a 
limit on the time during which it will 
allow an institution to rely upon new 
discretionary exemptions not originally 


raised in its decision letter. Second, 
whether the section 13(1) exemption 
applied to the record at issue. 


On July 15, 1993, the Office of the 
Commissioner provided the Ministry 
with a Notice of Inquiry which indi- 
cated, among other things, that, based on 
a policy adopted by the Office of the 
Commissioner, the Ministry would have 
35 days from the date of this correspond- 
ence to raise any new discretionary ex- 
emptions not originally claimed in the 
decision letter. No additional exemp- 
tions were raised by the Ministry during 
this period. It was not until December 
1993, that the Ministry raised, for the 
first time, the application of the discre- 
tionary exemptions provided by sections 
18(1)(g) and 19 of the Actin its represen- 


tations. 


In dealing with the issue of whether the 
Office of the Commissioner had the 
authority to seta limit on the time during 
which it will allow an institution to rely 
upon new discretionary exemptions not 
originally raised in its decision letter, 
Inquiry Officer Fineberg noted that there 
have been a number of previous orders 
issued by the Office of the Commis- 
sioner which have determined that the 
Commissioner has the power to control 
the process by which the inquiry process 
is undertaken; for example, Order P- 
373, the facts of which she found to be 
analogous to those in this appeal. In that 
case, some of the parties which had been 
notified as “affected persons” claimed 
that the time period allowed for submit- 
ting written representations was unrea- 
sonable. Inquiry Officer Fineberg pointed 
out, thatin addressing the concerns which 
had been raised in that appeal, former 
Assistant Commissioner Mitchinson 
made the following general statement: 


In my view, the authority to set time limits 
for the receipt of representations and to 
implement procedures for identifying and 


notifying affected persons ts included in the 
implied power to develop rules and proce- 
dures for the parties to an appeal. In my 
view, the procedures followed for setting 
time limits for the receipt of their represen- 
tation and the identification of parties was 
appropriate, in the circumstances of these 


appeals, 


Adopting this analysis, as well as the 
findings in other previous orders and the 
general scheme of the Act, Inquiry OF 
ficer Fineberg found that the implied 
power to develop rules and procedures 
gives the Office of the Commissioner the 
authority to seta limit on the time during 
which it will allow an institution to rely 
upon new discretionary exemptions not 
originally raised in its decision letter. She 
then noted that during the inquiry proc- 
ess, the Ministry was unable to provide 
any explanation as to why these new 
exemptions had been raised four months 
after the original decision letter had been 
issued, nor did it advance any extenuat- 
ing circumstances to take this case out- 
side the parameters of the policy. 


Since the Ministry failed to advance any 
arguments to indicate why the policy of 
the Office of the Commissioner should 
not apply in this appeal, Inquiry Officer 
Fineberg refused to consider the applica- 
tion of sections 18(1)(g) and 19 in the 
present appeal. 


Concerning the issue of whether the 
section 13(1) exemption applied to the 
record at issue, Inquiry Officer Fineberg 
noted that for section 13(1) to apply, the 
record must reveal advice or recommen- 
dations. She found that there was only a 
small portion of the information in the 
pages for which the Ministry claimed the 
section 13(1) exemption that met the 
requirements of this section. She then 
pointed out that section 13(2) of the Act 
lists certain exceptions to the 13(1) 
exemption. Specifically, section 13(2)(f) 


States: 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


Despite subsection (1), a head shall not 
refuse under subsection (1) to disclose a 


record that contains, 


a report or study on the performance or 
efficiency of an institution, whether the 
report or study is of a general nature or ts in 


respect of a particular program or policy; 


In its submissions, the Ministry stated 
that this section only applies to reports on 
the performance or efficiency of an insti- 
tution asa whole, but is not applicable to 
a report concerning part of a Ministry, as 
is the case in the present appeal. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg rejected this 
submission. She pointed out, that in 
Orders P-348 and P-603, Inquiry Officer 
Big Canoe adopted a broader inter- 
pretation of this section in order to not 
restrict access to those reports and studies 
which focus on one or more discrete 
program areas within an institution, rather 
than the institution as a whole. Inquiry 
Officer Fineberg also pointed out that 
this interpretation is consistent with the 
general principle of providing requesters 
with a general right of access to govern- 
ment information and is in accordance 
with the plain meaning of this exception. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg found, that 
even though a small portion of the infor- 
mation in the pages for which the Min- 
istry claimed the section 13(1) exemp- 
tion met the requirements of this section, 
these portions of the record fit squarely 
within the section 13(2)(f) mandatory 
exemption. This was the case because the 
corrective recommendations were de- 
signed to assist the institution to deal 
efficiently with existing and future prob- 
lems and to improve the performance 


and operations of the PCO.

appeal 


The Ministry of Health (the Ministry) 

received a request under the Freedom of 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act 
(the Acé) for access to all information 

pertaining to the requesters in their 

personal capacities and to a named 

physiotherapy centre. 


ORDER 
The Ministry’s decision was partially 
upheld. 


In its submissions, the Ministry stated 
that the presumption against disclosure 
found in section 21(3)(b) of the Act 
applied to the personal information con- 
tained in the records and that the release 
of this information would constitute an 
unjustified invasion of the personal pri- 
vacy of other named individuals under 
section 49(b) of the Act. In order to 
determine whether section 21(3)(b) ap- 
plied, the Assistant Commissioner first 
explored the context in which the infor- 
mation was originally created and then 
assembled together. 


The Assistant Commissioner pointed 
out that the personal information found 
in the records was initially collected by 
the Ministry during its own internal 


irivestigation into the billing practices of 
the appellants. According to the Minis- 
try’s representations, all of this infor- 
mation was then turned over to the On- 
tario Provincial Police detachment in 
Guelph, which subsequently initiated its 
own investigation. As a result of the 
OPP’s inquiry, charges were subse- 
quently laid against one of the appellants 
under the Criminal Code. 


Based on the fact that the personal infor- 
mation was originally obtained for an 
internal Ministry investigation which did 
not have a law enforcement dimension, 
the Assistant Commissioner had to con- 
sider whether the information was com- 
piled as part of an investigation into a 
possible violation of the law for the pur- 
poses of section 21(3)(b) of the Act. The 
key issue, therefore, was whether the 
term compiled means originally created 
or simply gathered or collected. 


The Assistant Commissioner referred to 
established caselaw which stated that the 
primary rule for interpreting legislation is 
that “the words of the statute must be first 
construed literally in their ordinary gram- 
matical sense”. The Assistant Commis- 
sioner then canvassed the dictionary 
meaning for the term “compile”, which 
isto gather or collect, rather than to create 
at first instance. 


In arriving at his conclusion, the Assist- 
ant Commissioner also took into ac- 
count the decision of the United States 
Supreme Court in John Doe Agency v. 
John Doe Corporation 110 S. Ct. 471 
(1989), which came to a similar conclu- 
sion about the meaning of the term 
compiled. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg con- 
cluded that the ordinary meaning of 
compile for the purposes of section 
21(3)(b) of the Actis to collect, gather or 


assemble together and, therefore, to 


compile does not mean to create at first 
instance. 


The result of this interpretation is that, 
for personal information to be compiled 
and identifiable as part of an investiga- 
tion into a possible violation oflaw under 
section 21(3)(b), it is not necessary for 
this information to have been originally 
created or prepared for that specific in- 
vestigation. Rather, the section 21(3)(b) 
presumption will apply as long as the 
personal information was, at some point 
in time, assembled or gathered together 
as part of this investigation. 


The Assistant Commissioner was satis- 
fied that the personal information 
contained in the records at issue was 
compiled by the OPP as part of an inves- 
tigation into the billing practices of the 
appellants and that the investigation was, 
in turn, directed towards determining 
whether there had been a violation of the 
Criminal Code for which charges could 
be laid. On this basis, he concluded that 
the release of this personal information 
would constitute a presumed unjustified 
invasion of the personal privacy of other 
individuals under section 21(3)(b) and 
must not be released to the appellants.

advice to government 


The Kingston Police Services Board (the 
Police) received a request under the 
Municipal Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (the Act), for 
access to records relating to submissions 
made by police officers and civilian em- 
ployees to the Chief of Police or his 
delegate, about “difficulties of their jobs 
within the Kingston Police Force”. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Police was partially 
upheld. 


Inquiry Officer Hale had to decide 
whether the record entitled: “Section II - 
Patrol Audit Report” fell within the 
ambit of the section 7(2)(i) exception to 
the section 7(1) exemption. A pivotal 
issue that had to be addressed was 
whether the record came within the 
third part of the test set out below. 


Inquiry Officer Hale stated that, for the 
exception provided by section 7(2)(i) of 
the Act to apply, it was necessary to 
establish that: 


1. The document must be a “report” 
within the meaning of the Acz. 


2. The report must have been prepared 
byacommittee or similar body within an 
institution. 


3. The committee or similar body must 
have been established for the purpose of 
preparing a report on a particular topic. 


In its submissions, the Police had stated 
that, although the report at issue in this 


10 


appeal was produced by its Strategic 
Working Committee, the lists of recom- 
mendations produced were not the re- 
port which the committee was given the 
task of completing. 


Inquiry Officer Hale rejected the sub- 
mission of the police that a report pre- 
pared by a committee must relate solely 
to the topic for which the committee was 
established — in this case, the creation of 
a long-range plan. He noted that the 
mandate of the Working Committee 
was to prepare a long-range strategic plan 
and that within this mandate, the com- 
mittee was charged with a number of 
objectives and duties. Further, it was held 
that the content of the record entitled 
“Section II — Patrol Audit Report” fell 
within at least one of the enumerated 
duties. 


Inquiry Officer Hale found that it would 
place too restrictive a reading on section 
7(2)(i) of the Actto hold that the excep- 
tion applies only to those reports which a 
committee is specifically directed to pre- 
pare. He felt that such an interpretation 
of the section is not borne out by its 
wording. Further, he found that the re- 
port prepared by the working committee 
fell within the ambit of its mandate, 
regardless of the fact that it could not be 
characterized as a report “recommend- 
ing broad goals and objectives”. Inquiry 
Officer Hale found, that if a committee 
decides to prepare a report — the subject 
matter of which is within its mandate — 
then, despite the fact that it is neither the 
committee’s final or ultimate report, nor 
the report the committee was originally 
requested to prepare, the exception in 
section 7(2)(i) stillapplies. He found that 
the third part of the test described above 
had been met.

previous disclosure of similar or same

Protection and Promotion Act 


The Simcoe County District Health Unit 
(the Health Unit) received a request un- 
der the Municipal Freedom of Information 
and Protection of Privacy Act (the Act) for 
all records in the custody of the institu- 
tion relating to the requester’s complaint 
to the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons of Ontario (the College), regard- 
ing the testing of drinking water at a 
particular location. 


The appellant subsequently narrowed 
his request to two letters which were 
authored by the Health Unit’s Medical 
Officer of Health (the MOH) and which 
were directed to the College. 


ORDER 

The Health Unit was ordered to obtain 
copies of the two letters from the MOH. 
The Health Unit was also ordered to 
issue a decision letter to indicate whether 
it was prepared to release the letters. 


The sole issue to be determined in this 
appeal was whether the two letters writ- 


ten by the MOH were in the custody 
and/or control of the Health Unit. 


In its representations, the Health Unit 
submitted that, although the records were 
created by a senior person employed by 
the agency, they were not in the custody 
of the Health Unit. It submitted that this 
was the case because the letters repre- 
sented “private correspondence” authored 
in response to a complaint filed with the 


College. 


In his representations, the MOH en- 
dorsed the position of the Health Unit 
and claimed that the records involved a 
private and confidential matter invol- 
ving him as a physician licensed by the 
College, and not as Medical Officer of 
Health. He stated that the Health Unit 
does not interfere with or monitor the 
personal or professional lives of Health 
Unit employees “unless it relates to that 


person’semploymentatthe Health Unit”. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg indi- 
cated that, in the present appeal, the two 
letters.at issue were provided by the MOH. 
of the Health Unit to the College. He 
further pointed out that these pieces of 
correspondence did not make reference 
to the nature of the complaint filed, nor 
did they appear to respond to any of the 
allegations raised. Rather, they contained 
only background information on the 
subject of water quality testing in the 
province. 


On this basis, the Assistant Commis- 
sioner found these records did not consti- 
tute a personal assertion by the MOH 
that the complaint raised against him was 
ill-founded. Instead, the Assistant 
Commissioner concluded that the MOH 
responded to the College in his role as a 
senior official of the Health Unit, rather 
than in his personal capacity. 


The Assistant Commissioner then or- 
dered the Health Unit to obtain copies of 


the two letters from the MOH so that it 
could re-establish formal custody over 
these documents. Once this step had 
been taken, the Health Unit was ordered 
to issue a decision letter to indicate 
whether it was prepared to release the 
letters and the enclosures.

The Town of Gravenhurst (the Town) 
received a request under the Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act (the Act) for, among other 
things, a 12-page summary of the evi- 
dence tendered atan OMB hearing. This 
summary was transcribed by a solicitor 
retained by the Town. The solicitor pro- 
vided a copy of this document to legal 
counsel for a developer who was also a 


party to the proceeding. 


ORDER 

The Town was ordered to disclose the 
record except for some personal infor- 
mation in the document which the 
requester did not want. 


The first issue to be determined in this 
appeal was whether section 12 of the Act 
(solicitor-client privilege) applied to the 
record at issue. The Assistant Commis- 
sioner found that it did. The second issue 
for consideration was whether the Town 
had waived its reliance on the solicitor- 
client privilege. 


In his representations, the appellant sub- 
mitted that the Town had waived solici- 
tor-client privilege when its solicitor dis- 
closed a copy of the summary to the 
solicitor for the developer of the project. 
In its representations, the Town stated 
that at no time did it waive its confiden- 
tiality rights in the record. The Town 
further asserted that it was not until the 
appeal was launched that it learned that 
its solicitor had released the record at 
issue. In this respect, the Town relied on 
the general principle that only the client 
can waive solicitor-client privilege. 


Assistant Commissioner Glasberg con- 
cluded that, since the Town’s solicitor 
was acting within his ostensible realm of 
authority and given the Town’s subse- 
quent endorsement of his actions invol- 
ving the OMB proceeding, the release of 
the record by the solicitor effectively 
bound the Town. He also found that, 
when the solicitor disclosed the record in 
this fashion, this constituted a general 
waiver of the solicitor-client privilege. 
The result was that the Town could not 
rely on section 12 of the Act to protect 
this documentation from disclosure.

Catholic Separate School Board 
MARCH 28, 1994 

(INQUIRY OFFICER FINEBERG) 


KEYWORDS

* employment history 


The Nipissing District Roman Catholic 

Separate School Board (the Board) re- 

ceived a request under the Municipal 
Freedom of Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act (the Act) for access to: 


the work assignments for each person as- 
signed as an occasional teacher in the Eng- 
lish Language Section of the Board for the 
school years 1991-1992 and 1992-1993. 


This should include the names, schools and 
dates of assignments. 


The Board responded by denying access 
to the requested information on the basis 
that it constituted the personal infor- 
mation of identifiable individuals and 
that disclosure, without the express con- 
sent of the individuals, would violate 
their personal privacy rights, thereby 
implicitly claiming the application of 
section 14 of the Act. The requester 
appealed the decision of the Board. 


ORDER 
The decision of the Board was upheld. 


‘The Board explained that the records 
containing the requested information 
consisted of forms entitled “Monthly 
Report of Absences and Supply Teach- 
ing” (the forms) and that the forms are 
submitted to the Board by each school 
for each month of the school year. 


14 


The Board further explained that, as a 
result of previous requests for similar 
information, it routinely provides the 
appellant with the dates and number of 
days worked by supply teachers in a 
particular school, but does not disclose 
the name of the absent teacher, the rea- 
son for the absence, the number of days 
of the absence or the name of the supply 
teacher. The name of the supply teacher 
was the only information at issue in this 


appeal. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg found that dis- 
closure of the names of the teachers 
would reveal other personal information 
about these individuals, namely the 
number of days and dates on which these 
individuals worked at a specific school 
during the 1991-92 and 1992-93 school 
years. Therefore, she found that the names 
themselves constituted “personal infor- 
mation” as defined in section 2(1) of the 


Act. 


Section 14 of the Act prohibits the dis- 
closure of personal information to any 
person other than the individual to 
whom the information relates, except in 
certain circumstances listed under sec- 
tion 14(1). One of the issues that Inquiry 
Officer Fineberg addressed in deciding 
whether the personal information at issue 
should be disclosed or not, was whether 
an Act of Ontario or Canada expressly 
authorized the disclosure of the personal 
information at issue [section 14(1)(d)]. 


In its submissions, the appellant did not 
make specific reference to any “Act of 
Ontario or Canada” which expressly au- 
thorizes the disclosure of the names of the 
supply teachers. However, the appellant 
referred to sections 45 and 65 (formerly 
section 64) of the Labour Relations Act. 
Section 45 refers to the arbitration 
process. Section 65 requires that “no 
employer shall participate in or interfere 
with the formulation, selection or ad- 


ministration of a trade union or the 
representation of employees by a trade 
union’. 


Based on these sections of the Labour 
Relations Act, the appellant submitted 
that: 


The school boards denial of the infor- 
mation to the Local unjustly inhibits the 
preparation of the arbitration case, in that 
the Local does not have all the factual data 
necessary to prepare its case to present to the 
arbitration board in order for the arbitra- 
tion board to make a complete and timely 
decision. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg pointed out 
that the appellant’s position appeared to 
be that disclosure is necessary in order for 
the appellant, a union, to adequately 
discharge its representational duties. 


Inquiry Officer Fineberg noted that there 
are no orders of the Office of the Com- 
missioner in which section 14(1)(d) has 
been interpreted. However, there are 
Compliance Investigation Reports which 
have considered the interpretation of the 
phrase “expressly authorized by statute”, 
as it is found in section 38(2) of the 
provincial Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act. 


This section states: 


No personshall collect personal information 
on behalf of an institution unless the collec- 
tion is expressly authorized by statute, 
used for the purposes of law enforcement or 
necessary to the proper administration of a 
lawfully authorized activity. [emphasis 
added] 


In Compliance Investigation Report 190- 
29P, the following comments were made 
about this section: 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


The phrase “expressly authorized by stat- 
ute” in subsection 38(2) of the Act requires 
either that specific types of personal infor- 
mation collected be expressly described in 
the statute, or a general reference to the 
activity be set out in the statute, together 
with a specific reference to the personal 
information to be collected in a regulation 
made under the statute, 1.e., in a form or in 
the text of the regulation. [emphasis added] 


In Inquiry Officer Fineberg’s view, the 
same interpretation should apply to the 
phrase “expressly authorizes” as itis found 
in section 14(1)(d) of the Act. Accord- 
ingly, she found that the exception in 
section 14(1)(d) of the Act had no 
application in the circumstances of this 


appeal.

MARCH 4, 1994 

(ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CAVOUKIAN) 


KEYWORDS 
accuracy * address * authorize * carbon 


copy * disclose * employee * harass 


The Ministry investigated a harassment 
complaint, finding that the complainant 
had harassed another employee (the ag- 
grieved employee). Sometime later, the 
agerieved employee complained that the 
harassing behaviour was continuing, and 
a second investigation was conducted by 
an investigator from another ministry, 
through the Workplace Discrimination 
and Harassment Prevention branch 
(WDHP) of Management Board 


Secretariat. 


The complainant believed that during 
the investigations, the Ministry had 
breached the Act: by disclosing his/her 
personal information to various indiyi- 
duals who should not have had access; 
and by failing to take reasonable steps to 
ensure that the personal information was 
accurate and up to date before using it 
to write the harassment investigation 
report. 


CONCLUSIONS 

The IPC concluded that the complain- 
ant’s personal information in the harass- 
ment complaint had been disclosed to 
the Deputy Minister, Investigator and 


18 


agerieved employee's Supervisor, in ac- 
cordance with section 42(d) of the Acz, 
since these individuals needed the record 
in the performance of their duties. Dis- 
closure of the complaint to the Acting 
Director of the complainant’s Branch 
and to the Human Resources Director, 
for the purpose of resolving the com- 
plaint informally, had not been in 
accordance with section 42 of the Act, 
since informal resolution was not an 
option available to the Ministry, accord- 
ing to the sexual harassment directive 
under which the first complaint had 
been investigated. 


The IPC found that the complainant's 
personal information in the covering let- 
ter had been disclosed to the aggrieved 
employee in accordance with section 
42(c), for the purpose for which it had 
been compiled by the Ministry to con- 
ductthe investigation. However, thecom- 
plainant’s address had not been disclosed 
to the aggrieved employee in accordance 


with the Acz. 


Thecomplainant’s personal information 
in a letter from the second investigator 
had not been disclosed by the Ministry, 
since the letter was not in the Ministry’s 
possession at the time of the disclosure. 


The IPC also found that the Ministry 
had taken reasonable steps, (e.g., collect- 
ing information directly, verifying infor- 
mation and writing the report within 30 
days) in accordance with section 40(2), 
to ensure that the complainant’s personal 
information was accurate and up to date. 


RECOMMENDATION 
The directive under which the first inves- 


tigation had been conducted had been ° 


replaced. Therefore, the IPC’s view was 
that no useful purpose could be served by 
making recommendations with respect 
to this directive. However, the IPC re- 
commended that all individuals involved

The complainant had been legally 
adopted at a young age. Her name had 
been officially changed on an adoption 
order to that of her adoptive parents. 
When the complainant had a child, she 
was required to complete a “Statement of 
Live Birth” form. The form asked for the 
mother’s “surname at birth” but did not 
specify, that according to the Vital Statis- 
tics Actand the Child and Family Services 
Act, if a person had been adopted, the 
person’s “surnameat birth” was the adop- 
tive name. The complainant thus pro- 
vided what she understood to be her 
surname at birth, i-e., her pre-adoptive

name. This was the name that was keyed 
into the Ministry’s registration data base 
as her maiden name. 


When the complainant's husband vis- 
ited the Ministry to apply foran extended 
birth certificate for their son, he provided 
the Ministry’s Clerk with the complain- 
ant’s maiden name (her adoptive name). 
Without requesting identification from 
him, the Clerk informed the complain- 
ant’s husband that the complainant’s 
maiden name listed on her child’s birth 
registration was different from the name 
he had given and told him the name that 


was listed, i.e., her pre-adoptive name. 


The complainant was concerned about 
the access to, and security of her personal 
information, since the Clerk had released 
the complainant’s surname at birth (her 
pre-adoptive name) to her husband with- 
out first requesting identification. The 
complainant was also concerned about 
the accuracy of the Ministry’s records, 
since her pre-adoptive name, which had 
been shown as her surname at birth on 
her son’s birth registration, had been 
keyed into the registration data base as 
her maiden name. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC was unable to determine what, 
if any measures had been taken by the 
Ministry’s Clerk before releasing her 
personal information to the complain- 
ant’s husband. The Ministry stated that 
its staff are trained on, and acutely aware 
of the importance of ensuring a person’s 
identification prior to releasing any per- 
sonal information. Staff are told that 
applicants must provide specific infor- 
mation to prove entitlement to the 
personal information they are seeking. 
However, the Ministry did not have any 
written procedures or policies on this 
matter. The IPC concluded, that while 
reasonable measures to prevent unau- 
thorized access to records were “defined” 


and “put in place”, they were not 
“documented” as required by section 4(1) 
of Regulation 460, as amended. 


With respect to theaccuracy ofits records, 
the Ministry advised that it was aware of 
the difficulties associated with the word- 
ing of the form and that there was a need 
to amend it. The Ministry suggested that 
any changes to the Form could be in- 
cluded as a part of its reform of the birth 
registration process. In the interim, when 
the form is next reprinted, the Ministry 
would include instructions on the back 
specifying that if the person had been 
adopted, the person’s adoptive name 
shouldbe givenas the “surnameat birth”. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Minis- 
try “document” the measures that were 
defined and put in place to prevent unau- 
thorized access to records in its custody 
and control, in accordance with section 


4(1) of Regulation 460, as amended.

The Ontario Human Rights Commis- 
sion (OHRC) had been conducting an 
investigation into a complaint against a 
library, filed by an employee of the 
library. During the course of its investi- 
gation, the OHRC had asked relevant 
library employees, including the com- 


plainant, for their racial backgrounds. 
When the complainant had refused, she 
had been advised by the OHRC’s Inves- 
tigating Officer that this information was 


already contained inthe OHRC’s records. 


The complainant was concerned that the 
OHRC’s collection of personal infor- 
mation was contrary to the Act and that 
information about her racial background 
had been indirectly collected. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that the OHRC com- 
plaint involved an alleged contravention 
of section 5(1) of the Ontario Human 
Rights Code, which states that every per- 
son has a right to equal treatment with 
respect to employment without discrimi- 
nation because of race, ancestry, place of 
origin, colour, etc. The OHRC 
complaint was specifically about dis- 
crimination because of race and colour. 
As a part of its investigation of a com- 
plaint of this nature, the OHRC had 
asked library employees, who worked in 
the immediate area of the staff member 
who had filed the OHRC complaint, 
for their racial backgrounds. This in- 


cluded the complainant. 


The OHRC’s collection of the racial 
background information was for the 
purpose of pursuing the investigation of 
a complaint filed under the Code. In 
Order 200, the IPC had determined that 
investigations into complaints made 
under the Code were considered law 
enforcement matters. Similarly, in this 
case, we concluded that the OHRC’s 
collection of the racial background infor- 
mation of library employees was used for 
the purposes of law enforcement, in 
accordance with section 38(2) of the Act. 


When the complainant had refused to 
provide her racial background, she had 
been advised by the Investigating Officer 
that the OHRC already had this infor-

mation. The OHRC informed the IPC 
that the complainant had been advised of 
this in error. The OHRC stated that it 
had no information in its records regard- 
ing the complainant’s racial background 
and that it was sending a letter of expla- 
nation to the complainant. The IPC 
informed the complainant of this fact, 
and she was satisfied that the OHRC’s 
records did not contain information 


about her racial background.

INVESTIGATION I[93-106P 
Institution: Workers’ Compensation Board

KEYWORDS 
disclose * WCB 


The complainant’s spouse had filed a 
claim for non-economic loss with the 
WCB. The Board subsequently disclosed 
the spouse’s personal information to her 
employer. The spouse’s information was 
contained in a psychiatrist’s report, as- 
sessment and covering letter (the NEL). 
The information in the NEL included 
details concerning the spouse’s sexual life 
with the complainant, and other infor- 
mation about the complainant, such as 
his ageand state ofhealth. The complain- 
ant was of the view that the disclosure of 
his personal information to his spouse’s 
employer was a breach of the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The WCB stated that the disclosure of 
the complainant’s personal information 
was in accordance with section 42(12) of 
the Workers’ Compensation Act (the 
WCA) which requires the Board to send 
a copy of the NEL to both the worker 
and the accident employer. The WCB 


20 


further stated that spousal and family 
information, both before and after an 
injury, is an important component used 
to assess a worker’s claim for permanent 
impairment due to mental and 
behaviourial disorders. Since either the 
worker or his/her employer may ob- 
ject to the assessment by asking for a 
second assessment, both parties to the 
claim must be provided with the same 
document. 


The IPC concluded that the disclosure of 
the complainant’s personal information 
to his spouse’s employer was in accord- 
ance with section 42(12) of the WCA. 
The disclosure was, therefore, in accord- 
ance with section 42(e) of the Acz, for the 
purposes of complying with an Act of the 
Legislature. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC was concerned that the NEL 
contained such detailed information 
about the complainant and other family 
members. During the course of the in- 
vestigation, the Board had informed us 
that a policy was being prepared that 
would require doctors to rewrite medical 
assessments that contained too much or 
unnecessary information. We therefore 
recommended that the Board’s policy 
include a reminder to doctors of the 
requirements of the Act, with regard to 
writing medical assessments, and in par- 
ticular, with respect to the personal infor- 
mation of individuals other than the 
worker.

KEYWORDS 
collect * grievance * necessary * OPSEU 


As a result of a grievance, the Ministry 
and the Ontario Public Service Em- 


ployees Union (OPSEU) had signed a 


memorandum of settlement agreeing to 
convert a number of Ministry seasonal 
jobs to permanentstatus. The memoran- 
dum of settlement was made an order of 


the Grievance Settlement Board (GSB). 


The complainant was one of the em- 
ployees to be reinstated to permanent 
status. Under the memorandum, the 
Ministry was required to reimburse the 
complainant, after making specific de- 
ductions for the period that he was not 
employed by the Ministry, i.e., the rein- 
statement period. 


The Ministry requested that the com- 
plainant provide details of gross pay, 
regular salaries, overtime payments, pen- 
sion payments, Canada Pension Plan 
(CPP) contributionsand unemployment 
insurance benefits. This information was 
collected from each employee eligible for 
reinstatement, so that the Ministry could 
determine the amountofreimbursement 
and the specific deductions for that em- 
ployee during the period of reinstatement. 


The complainant was concerned that the 
collection of his personal information 
was contrary to section 38(2) of the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that since the memoran- 
dum had been madean order of the GSB, 
it was final and binding upon the parties. 
It was our view that the Ministry wasthus 
obliged to implement the terms of rein- 
statement in the memorandum and that 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


this implementation was a lawfully au- 
thorized activity. In implementing the 
terms, the Ministry was required to retro- 
actively compensate, for lost wages, those 
employees who met the criteria for rein- 
statement, including the complainant. 
To determine the total compensation to 
which each employee was entitled, the 
Ministry requested the above noted per- 
sonal information. 


The IPC found that the Ministry’s col- 
lection of this personal information, with 
the exception of CPP contributions, was 
“necessary” to the proper administration 
of the lawfully authorized activity of im- 
plementing the memorandum’s terms of 
reinstatement. Therefore, the Ministry’s 
collection was in accordance with section 


38(2) of the Act. 


With respect to the collection of CPP 
contributions, the Ministry informed the 
IPC that, after seeking clarification from 
Revenue Canada, it determined that this 
information was not required and should 
not have been collected. The Ministry 


advised that it was no longer seeking this - 


information from the complainant. 


RECOMMENDATION 

Since the Ministry had acknowledged 
that its collection of the CPP contribu- 
tions was unnecessary and indicated that 
it would be emphasizing the privacy as- 
pects of the Act as part of its regular 
program to train staff on the require- 
ments of the legislation, the IPC made no 
further recommendations.

The complainant, a 17-year-old student 
of the Board, stated that she had left 
home because of threatened physical 
abuse by her mother and stepfather. She 
had asked her school principal not to 
disclose her new address and telephone 
number to her mother and stepfather. 
She had been assured that her Ontario 
Student Record (OSR) would not con- 
tain her address and that it would not be 


disclosed. 


About five months later, the complain- 
ant, who had been attending a co-op job 
placement at a law firm, was absent for 
several days. School staff tried to call her 
to ask her to return some documents to 
the law firm. The principal visited her 


home, but there was no response. 


One of the firm’s lawyers had apparently 
been reporting thecomplainant’s progress 
in school to the stepfather. The lawyer 
told the stepfather that the complainant 
had withdrawn from the co-op program. 
The mother called the school and found 
that her daughter had quit school. The 
telephone number and address were then 
released to the mother. The complainant 
stated that she subsequently received 
threatening telephone calls from her 
mother and stepfather. She believed that 
the disclosure of her address and tel- 
ephone number breached the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The Board indicated that the principal 
had agreed to keep only the telephone 
numberinconfidence, and that “itwould 
have been unlikely for him to assure any 


student that the address would not form 
part of the OSR”. The Board stated that 
it had disclosed the information to the 
mother in an effort to contact the com- 
plainant. 


The IPC established that the address had 
been recorded in the OSR. The Educa- 
tion Act grants parents the right to 
examine the OSR of their child until 
he/she reaches the age of 18. The IPC 
thus concluded that the complainant’ s 
address had been disclosed in accord- 
ance with section 32(e) of the Act, i.e., 
in order to comply with an Act of the 
Legislature. 


The IPC was unable to establish if the 
telephone number had also been re- 
corded in the OSR. In the IPC’s view, 
the disclosure of the telephone number 
was not in keeping with the spirit of the 
Act, given the Board’s agreement with 
the complainant. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Board 
incorporate the following steps into its 
procedures: 


1. That students under the age of 18, 
who request non-disclosure of their OSR 
information to their parents, be advised 
of the Board’s obligations under the Edu- 
cation Act to allow parents to examine 


their child’s OSR. 


2. That the Board’s co-op employers be 
advised, that the Board is an institution 
under the Act, and of the requirement 
that student information is required to 


be kept confidential.

SG. accessreq 


The complainant had filed an insurance 
claim with the City concerning damage 
to his compact disc player, which he 
stated had been caused by vibrations 
from machinery used by the City to 
repair a water-main break. The com- 
plainant had then submitted a claim to 
the City’s insurance adjustors. His claim 
was denied. 


The complainant then filed access to 
information requests under the Act. He 
also appealed the denial of his insurance 
claim to the City’s Board of Control. In 
determining the appeal, the Board of 
Control had before it, a staff report from 
the City’s Manager of Insurance/Risk 
Administration and the City Treasurer. 
Based on these individuals’ recommen- 
dations, the Board of Control denied the 
appeal. 


The complainant contended that the 
City had used his access requests to cause 
his insurance claim against the City to be 
denied by its Board of Control. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC found that when the Board of 
Control considered the complainant’s 
appeal of the denial of his insurance 
claim, it had before it the staff report 
which included a paragraph containing 
information about the complainant’s 
access request. 


The City stated that it had relied on 
section 31 (b) for its use of the complain- 
ant’s personal information, i.e., for the 
purpose for which it had been obtained 
or compiled or for a consistent purpose. 


22 


The IPC determined that the City had 
obtained or compiled the complainant’s 
personal information relating to his ac- 
cess request for the purpose of adminis- 
tering the access request. However, the 
City had used this personal information, 
when it was included in the report, to 
consider the complainant’s appeal of the 
denial of his insurance claim. Therefore, 
it was the IPC’s view that it could not be 
said that the City had used the complain- 
ant’s personal information relating to his 
access request for the purpose for which 
this information had been obtained or 
compiled. 


It was also the IPC’s view that the infor- 
mation had not been used for a consist- 
ent purpose. Therefore, the City’s use of 
the complainant’s personal information 
relating to his access request was not in 
accordance with section 31(b) of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

We recommended that the City take 
steps to ensure that personal information 
be used in accordance with the Acz¢, for 
example, amend any existing guidelines 
or procedures and inform all appropriate 
staff accordingly.

Thecomplainant, a City employee, made 
a claim to the Workers’ Compensation 
Board (WCB) with respect to a back 
injury. His claim was denied. Later, when 
he made a request to the WCB for access 
to his claim file, he found that the City 


had disclosed certain information about 
him to the WCB. He believed that dis- 
closure of some information not relevant 
to his claim breached the Act, and that, in 
particular, three verbal comments made 
by City employees to the WCB Investi- 
gator had been prejudicial to his claim. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC concluded that the complain- 
ant’s personal information in his short- 
term disability reportand sickleave record 
was disclosed in accordance with section 
32(b) of the Act, since he had authorized 
the City to disclose his medical infor- 
mation contained in these records to the 


WCB. 


The IPC determined that the City had 
compiled the complainant’s personal 
information in his leave ofabsence record, 
to create a record of his absenteeism for 
use in human resources programs; and 
had disclosed this information to the 
WCB to provide an overall picture of his 
absences from work. It was the IPC’s 
view that the disclosure was for a purpose 
that was reasonably compatible with the 
purpose for which the personal infor- 
mation had been compiled and was, — 
thus, for a consistent purpose, in accord- 
ance with section 32(c) of the Act. 


The IPC concluded that the items of the 
complainant’s personal information in 
the employee history record (details re- 
specting the claim) were disclosed in 
accordance with the Workers’ Compensa- 
tion Act (the WCA). The disclosure of 
these items was thus in accordance with 
section 32(e) of the Act, in order to 
comply with an Act of the legislature. 
However, the disclosure of items not 
respecting the claim was not in accord- 
ance with the Act. 


The IPC concluded that the complain- 
ant’s personal information in two items 
of correspondence to the WCB, was 


INFORMATION 
AND PRIVACY 
COMMISSIONER/ 
ONTARIO 


disclosed in accordance with sections 
32(e) and 32(c) respectively. The WCB 
had requested that the City furnish de- 
tails respecting the claim, in accordance 
with the WCA, and the information was 
disclosed for the purpose for which it had 
been compiled to provide further infor- 
mation to the WCB and to request an 
investigation. 


Only the verbal comment about the 
complainant’s job performancecontained 
information that was a matter of record 
with the City and was thus, “personal 
information”. The IPC found that the 
WCB had required the City to furnish 
the information during interviews with 
employees, inaccordance with the WCA. 
The disclosure of this personal infor- 
mation was thus, in accordance with 


section 32(e) of the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that personal 
information unrelated to an accident or 
claim be severed from records provided 


to the WCB.

The complainant’s son, who has special 
needs, was enrolled in the Municipality’s 
Early Intervention Services Program 
(EISP). The EISP is a home-based, com- 
prehensive, early intervention service for 
children with special needs and their 
families. The EISP is administered by the 
Municipality and funded by the Minis- 


try of Community and Social Services 
(the Ministry) with no cost to the family. 
The family is the key decision maker 
who, with staff, set goals based on iden- 
tified needs. 


Although the EISP is family-oriented, 
the complainant did not agree with the 
family approach. She felt that the EISP 
should deal only with her son’s develop- 
ment and objected to information relat- 
ing to herself and her other child being 


included in her son’s file. 


She complained that the Municipality 
did not have the authority to collect her 
family’s personal information and that 
the Municipality had not given any no- 
tice of its collection. 


CONCLUSION 

The IPC determined that the EISP was 
funded by the Ministry under the Child 
and Family Services Act and its Regula- 
tions, and was thus a lawfully authorized 
activity. The IPC also concluded, that in 
order to make a program geared to help- 
ing families of children with special needs 
work well, it was necessary for the Mu- 
nicipality to obtain information about 
more than just the special needs of the 
child in question. It was our view that the 
Municipality’s collection of personal 
information, including information 
about other family members, was neces- 
sary to the proper administration of a 
lawfully authorized activity, and was thus 
in accordance with section 28(2) of the 
Act. 


The Municipality stated that it had given 
notice of the conduct of the program and 
the purpose for which the personal infor- 
mation collected was to be used. How- 
ever, since this notice did not include the 
legal authority for the collection and the 
title, business address and telephone 
number of an employee of the Munici- 
pality who could answer questions about 


the collection, the notice did not meet 
the full requirements of section 29(2) of 
the Act. 


RECOMMENDATION 

The IPC recommended that the Mu- 
nicipality give proper notice for the 
collection of personal information on its 
questionnaires and forms relating to its 
EISP, in accordance with section 29(2) 
of the Act.

An anonymous report on budget cuts 
was attached to the public agenda for 
one of the Board’s meetings. The report 
contained the personal information of 
several employees. A senior officer 
representing one of these employees 
complained that by attaching the report 
to the public agenda, the Board had 
disclosed the employee’s personal 
information, contrary to the Act. 


CONCLUSION 

The Board stated, that in order to 
comply with the Police Services Act, it 
had to consider matters in public session 
unless it was of the opinion that the 
requirements of section 35(4) of the 
Police Services Act had been met, i.e., 
the Board may exclude the public from 
a meeting or hearing where the matters 
to be disclosed involve public security 
or intimate financial or personal details.

The Board stated, that in this case, a 
consideration of the information at issue 
suggested that, in retrospect, it would 
have been more appropriate to have had 
the report at issue, or the relevant 
portions of it, placed on the Board’s 
confidential agenda rather than on its 
public agenda. The Board stated that the 
disclosure of the information in question 
had been inadvertent. 


The Board assured us that it would make 
all reasonable efforts to ensure that no 
sensitive personal information would 
appear on future Board public agendas 
and that no similar accidental disclosures 
of sensitive information would occur in 
the future. 


The senior officer representing the 
employee was informed of the Board’s 


response to the complaint. He and the 
employee were satisfied with the Board’s 
assurances.
