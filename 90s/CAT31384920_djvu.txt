Patents 


8.  June  13,  1991;  S.  1291. 

To  amend  title  35,  United  States  Code,  to  impose  a  5-year  moratorium  on  the  granting  of  pa¬ 
tents  on  invertebrate  or  vertebrate  animals,  including  those  that  have  been  genetically  engi¬ 
neered,  in  order  to  provide  time  for  Congress  to  fully  assess,  consider,  and  respond  to  the 
economic,  environmental,  and  ethical  issues  raised  by  the  patenting  of  such  animals. 

Patenting  of  animals  raises  economic,  environmental,  and  ethical  issues  and  may  also  lead 
to  potential  financial  liability  on  the  part  of  the  Federal  Government  for  restitution  of  pa¬ 
tent  holders  who  have  had  patents  revoked  or  altered.  No  invertebrate  or  vertebrate  ani¬ 
mal,  including  genetically  engineered  animals  (animal  deliberately  modified  by  the 
introduction  or  manipulation  of  genetic  material)  shall  be  considered  patentable  during  the 
5-year  period.

Plans  will  be  drawn  up  or  revised  taking  into  consideration  the  species  within  the  old 
growth  forest  and  any  potential  impact  on  these  species  and  to  the  forest  system.  Alterna¬ 
tive  plans  will  be  considered  if  any  species  listed  in  the  Endangered  Species  Act  or  any  criti¬ 
cal  habitat  of  the  species  is  jeopardized.
