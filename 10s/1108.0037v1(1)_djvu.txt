Abstract: 

In  this  paper,  a  few  more  implications  of  the  laws  of  physical  transactions  as  per  the  Theory  of 
Abstraction  are  dealt  with.  Analysis  of  those  implications  suggests  the  existence  of  'hidden'  mass  and 
'hidden'  energy  in  a  given  physical  transaction.  Trajectory  -examination  of  such  possible  transport  is 
carried  out.  Relativistic  cyclist  phenomena  are  also  dealt  with  in  this  paper. 


Introduction: 

A  particle  in  an  isolated  box  will  tend  to  move  in  all  possible  directions.  A  bias  towards  any  given 
direction  indicates  an  imbalance  of  support  towards  its  movement  in  that  given  direction  and  resistance 
against  it.  Considering  the  movement  of  an  energy  quantum  in  a  particular  direction,  this  difference 
between  the  concerned  support  and  the  concerned  resistance  must  be  al  least  the  same  of  the  given 
energy  quantum,  in  accordance  to  the  Theory  of  Abstraction.  For  a  given  quantum-state  (hv), 

S~R  =  hv  ...  (1) 

Where,  S  and  R  represent  the  support  and  resistance  respectively. 

This  means  that  at  least  one  half  of  a  total  energy-quantum  gives  it  its  direction  while  the  other  part 
gives  it  its  magnitude.  The  direction  part  remains  'hidden'  while  only  the  magnitude  part  shows  up  as 
the  value  of  the  given  quantum  state.  Considering  the  direction  part  however  may  reduce  quantum- 
transport  to  classical  transport  as  we  shall  see  here. 

Let  us  consider  a  photon  revolving  around  a  given  body  of  mass  (M)  and  within  a  radius  (R).  Let  mn  be 
the  instantaneous  mass  of  the  given  photon.  Then,  according  to  the  classical  theory  of  gravitation,  the 
force  of  gravity  on  the  total  photon  (magnitude  +  direction  parts)  due  to  the  given  body  equals 

GM(mn  +  mn)    ,      2GMmn 


R2  <l-e-      R2      ■ 

In  order  that  the  photon  does  not  move  away  from  the  body,  the  difference  between  support  and 
resistance  in  that  given  direction  must  be  zero.  Thus,  in  order  to  bind  the  photon  within  a  radius  R,  only 
its  direction-part  needs  to  be  bound.

Now  the  outward  force  experienced  by  the  direction-part  of  the  photon  equals  — — ;  vaccum  being  the 
medium  considered.

Thus,  if  mass  is  concentrated  within  a  radius  R  such  that  —  «  1027 kg /m,  then  the  body  is  a  black-hole, 
in  accordance  with  the  Theory  of  Abstraction.  This  result  is  validated  by  existing  data. 

In  this  treatment,  considering  the  direction-part  of  a  given  energy-quantum,  classical  transport  merges 
with  quantum-transport  quite  perfectly.  Support  towards  the  given  direction  of  transport  of  a  given 
energy-quantum  comprises  the  direction-part  of  it  while  a  given  resistance  may  act  upon  the  total 
energy-quantum  i.e.,  the  direction-part  and  the  magnitude-part  combined. 


Chaos-Analysis  of  Quantum-Transport: 

For  a  given  transport  of  energy-quantum,  between  an  initial  and  a  final  point,  let  the  trajectory  of  the 
initial  point  x0  =  x(o)  be  denoted  by: 

x(t)  =  f\x0) 

Expanding  ft(x0  +  Sx0)  to  linear  order,  the  evolution  of  the  distance  to  a  neighbouring  trajectory 
Xj(t)  +  8xi(t)  is  given  by  the  Jacobian  matrix/: 


8Xi(t)  =  ^/(Xo);,-  Sxoj, 


7  =  1 

6xt(t) 


''^»=itr       -(3) 


A  trajectory  of  an  energy-quantum  as  moving  on  a  flat  surface  is  specified  by  two  position  coordinates 
and  the  direction  of  motion.  The  Jacobian  matrix  describes  the  deformation  of  an  infinitesimal 
neighbourhood  of  x(t)along  the  transport.  Its  eigenvectors  and  eigenvalues  give  the  directions  and  the 
corresponding  rates  of  expansion  or  contraction.  The  trajectories  that  start  out  in  an  infinitesimal 
neighbourhood  separate  along  the  unstable  directions  (those  whose  eigenvalues  are  greater  than  unity 
in  magnitude),  approach  each  other  along  the  stable  directions  (those  whose  eigenvalues  are  less  than 
unity  in  magnitude),  and  maintain  their  distance  along  the  marginal  directions  (those  whose  eigenvalues 
equal  unity  in  magnitude). 

Holding  the  hyperbolicity  assumption  (i.e.,  for  large  n  the  prefactors  at,  reflecting  the  overall  size  of  the 
system,  are  overwhelmed  by  the  exponential  growth  of  the  unstable  eigenvalues  Ait  and  may  thus  be 

neglected),  to  be  justified,  we  may  replace  the  magnitude  of  the  area  of  the  ith  strip  \Bt  |  by  - — -  and

consider  the  sum, 

n 
[n  =  l|X|; 


i 


where  the  sum  goes  over  all  periodic  points  of  period  n.  We  now  define  a  generating  function  for  sums 
over  all  periodic  orbits  of  all  lengths: 


\z  =  V  \n  zn  ...  (4) 


n=l 

For  large  n,  the  nth  level  sum  tends  to  the  limit  \n  -*  e~ny,  so  the  escape  rate  y  is  determined  by  the 
smallest  z  =  eY  for  which  equation  (4)  diverges:

Making  an  analogy  to  the  Riemann  zeta-function,  for  periodic  orbit  cycles, 


r*  =  -*|£>(i-tp): 


V 

\{z)  is  a  logarithmic  derivative  of  the  infinite  product

This  represents  the  dynamical  zeta  function  for  the  escape  rate  of  the  trajectories  of  quantum-transport. 
The  fraction  of  initial  x  whose  trajectories  remain  within  B  at  time  t  may  decay  exponentially 

f  dxdy  S\y  —  ft(x)]

The  integral  over  x  starts  a  trajectory  at  every  x  e  B.  The  integral  over  y  tests  if  this  trajectory  still  falls 
within  limits  of  B  at  time  t. 


The  Kernel  of  this  integral  is  the  evolution  operator  for  a  d-dimensional  transport, 

£t(y,x)  =  «5[y -/'(*)]  ...(6) 

Expressing  the  finite  time  Kernel  Ll  in  terms  of  A,  the  generator  of  infinite  time  translations, 

Ll  =  etA  ...(7) 

This  is  very  much  similar  to  the  way  quantum  evolution  is  generated  by  the  Hamiltonian. 


Relativity  of  Cyclists  and  Symmetry  Analysis: 

The  component  of  the  dynamics  along  the  continuous  symmetry  directions  of  the  trajectory  behavior  or 
'drift'  may  be  induced  by  the  symmetries  themselves.  In  presence  of  a  continuous  symmetry,  an  orbit 
explores  the  manifold  swept  by  combined  actions  of  the  dynamics  and  the  symmetry  induced  drifts.  A 
group  member  can  be  parameterized  by  angle  9,  with  the  group  multiplication  law  g(9')  g(9)  = 
g{9'  +  9)  and  its  action  on  smooth  periodic  functions  u{9  +  2YI)  =  u(9)  generated  by, 

The  differential  operator  T  is  reminiscent  of  the  generator  of  spatial  translations.  The  constant  velocity 
field  v{x)  =  v  =  C.T  acts  on  Xj  by  replacing  it  by  the  velocity  vector  Cj. 

Let,  G  be  a  group  and  gB  -*  B  a  group  action  on  the  state  space  B.  The  [d  x  d]  matrices  g  acting  on 
vectors  in  the  d-dimensional  state  space  B  from  a  linear  representation  of  the  group  G.  If  the  action  of 
every  element  g  of  a  group  G  commutes  with  the  flow, 

g  v{x)  =  v(gx),gft(x)  =  f(gx) 

G  is  a  symmetry  of  the  dynamics  and  is  invariant  under  G  or  G-equivalent.  For  any  x  e  B,  the  group  orbit 
Bx  of  x  is  the  set  of  all  group  actions 

Bx  =  [gx\geG]  ...  (8) 

The  time  evolution  and  the  continuous  symmetries  can  be  considered  on  the  same  Lie  group  footing.  An 
element  of  a  compact  Lie  group  continuously  connected  to  identity  can  be  written  as, 

g(0)  =  eeT,  e.T  =  Yj0Ja,a  =  1,2,3 N; 

where  9.  T  is  a  Lie  element  and  9a  are  the  parameters  of  the  transformation. 

Any  representation  of  a  compact  Lie  group  G  is  fully  reducible,  and  invariant  tensors  constructed  by 
contractions  of  Ta  are  useful  for  identifying  irreducible  representations.  The  simplest  such  invariant  is, 

TT.T  =  Yc(2a)  || W 


equilibria  satisfy  ft(x)  —  x  =  0  and  relative  equilibria  satisfy  ft(x)  —  g(t)x  =  0  for  any  t.  A  relative 
periodic  orbit  is  periodic  in  its  mean  velocity,Cp  =  6p/Tp  comoving  frame,  but  in  the  stationary  frame  its 
trajectory  is  quasiperiodic.  A  relative  periodic  orbit  may  be  pre-periodic  if  it  is  equivariant  under  a 
discrete  symmetry.  Translational  symmetry  allows  for  relative  equilibria  characterized  by  a  fixed  profile 
Eulerian  velocity  \iTW  (x)  moving  with  constant  velocity  C,i.e., 

fj.  (x,  t)  =  \iTW  (x  -  Ct)  ...(9) 

A  relative  periodic  solution  is  a  solution  that  recurs  at  time  Tp  with  exactly  the  same  disposition  of  the 
Eulerian  velocity  fields  over  the  entire  cell,  but  shifted  by  a  2-dimensional  (streamwise  -  spanwise) 
translational  gp.  By  discrete  symmetries,  these  solutions  come  in  counter-travelling  pairs 

Uq(x  —  Ct),  — Uq(— X  +  Ct). 

The  Hilbert  basis  may  be  written  as: 

ut  =  x\  +  x\,u2  =  y\  +  yi,u3  =  xty2  -  x2yt,u4  =  x1y1  +  x2y2,u5  =  z 

This  is  invariant  under  the  special  orthogonal  graph  SO(2);i.e.,  a  group  of  length-preserving  rotations  in  a 
plane.  The  polynomials  are  linearly  independent,  but  related  through  one  syzygy, 

uxu2  —  ul  —  u|  =  0  ...  (10) 

yielding  a  4-dimensional  B/  SO(2)  reduced  state-space. 

The  dynamical  equations  following  from  chain  rule  are, 


u^—xj  ...(11). 


Conclusion: 

From  the  Theory  of  Abstraction,  we  arrive  at  'hidden'  direction  part  of  an  energy-quantum.  Quantum 
dynamics  is  seen  to  merge  with  classical  dynamics  if  this  hidden  direction-part  of  the  quantum-states 
are  taken  into  consideration,  as  validated  by  practical  analysis  and  data.  Moreover,  this  hidden  part  of 
an  actual  energy-quantum  may  explain  the  dark-energy  problem.  As  a  support  towards  transport 
comprises  the  direction-part  only,  and  as  the  resistance  against  motion  is  offered  against  the  whole  of 
an  energy-quantum  (direction-part  +  magnitude-part),  this  hidden  energy  may  very  well  affect  a 
gravitational  field.  On  the  other  hand,  if  matter  is  considered  to  be  condensed  energy,  and  as  such 
condensed  energy  quanta  in  some  form  of  orientation  in  space  time,  there  ought  to  be  some  self-same 
hidden  mass  as  the  magnitude-parts  of  the  constituent  energy  quanta,  thereby  indicating  a  hidden  dark- 
matter.  Thus  the  anomaly  of  the  existence  of  dark-matter  and  dark-energy  being  hidden  from  us  may  be 
reconciled  with  in  accordance  with  the  Theory  of  Abstraction.
