For  a  while  there,  it  was  beginning  to  look  lilce  there  would  never  be  a  dot  matrix 
printer  versatile  enough  to  be  a  real  jack-of-all-trades.  But  no  more.  Now,  for  the  first 
time  ever,  there's  a  new  series  of  printers  designed  to  bring  you  big-business 
performance  at  a  small-business  price. 

Star's  new  NX  Series  printers  have  all  the  write  stuff  you  need  to  get  the  job  done 
and  then  some.  Let's  start  with  multiple  fonts.  Each  of  the  four  NX  Series  printers 
comes  equipped  with  an  incredible  variety  of  fonts,  sizes  and  enhancements, 
DF*\KTOP  NEWS     which,  when  combined,  put  thousands  of  printstyles 

at  your  fingertips.  And  all  offer 
high  resolution  graphics  for  more 
professional-looking  presentations.

THESE  PIRATES  HAVE 

TONGUES  AS  SHARP 
AS  THEIR  SWORDi 


Lucasfilm'"  Games'  swashbuckling  new 
graphic  adventure  lets  you  trade  insults  with 
some  of  the  saltiest  seamen  to  ever  saQ  the 
seven  seas. 

In  The  Secret  of  Monkey  Island,"  you'll 
sling  one-liners  with  a  fast-talking  used  ship 
salesman,  a  sarcastic  swordmaster,  a  wisecrack- 
ing corpse,  and  a  prisoner  whose  breath  would 
stop  a  horse.  You'll  also  hunt  for  buried  treasure, 
chase  after  a  beautiful  woman, 
and-perhapS"Un  ravel  one  of 
the  twistiest  plots  in  the  history 
of  adventure  gaming. 
You're  short,  broke,  clueless 
and  friendless. 

And  you've  just  arrived  on 
Melee  Island  seeking  fame  and  fortune.  Explain- 
ing to  anyone  who'll  listen  that  you  want  to  be 
a  pirate. 

Being  the  easy-going  types  they  are,  your 
new  pirate  pals  invite  you  into  the  club,  just  as 


soon  as  you've  completed  three  liny  trials. 

Among  other  things,  you'll  need  to  sedate 
some  piranha  poodles,  burglarize  the  governor's 
mansion,  and  do  business  with  the  scum  of  the 
earth.  And  if  that's  not  enough,  you'll  have  to 
figure  out  whether  the  300-pound  voodoo 
priestess  covets  your  rubber  chicken,  fetid  fish, 
pack  ofbreath  mints,  or... 

If  the  brigands  don't  grab  you, 
the  graphics  will. 

Lucasfilm  Games  set  today's 
graphic  standards  with  games  like 
Loom  and  Indiana  Jones  and  the 
Last  Cruside.  Now  The  Secret 
of  Monkey  Island  ups  the  stan- 
dards a  few  more  notches  with 
stunning  256-color  VGA  graphics  1 16-color 
EGA  version  also  available),  proportionally 
scaled  animated  characters,  and  cinematic 
pans  and  camera  angles.

These  are  exciting  times  in  the 
world  of  home  computers.  The 
technologies  of  the  last  decade, 
from  computer  chips  to  video 
displays,  are  coming  together  and  giv- 
ing new  meaning  to  the  term  desktop 
fusion.  Nowhere  is  this  more  apparent 
than  in  Japan,  where  a  combined  ef- 
fort of  government  direction,  con- 
trolled competition,  and  state-of-the- 
art  engineering  have  created  a  late- 
tweniieth-centur>'  electronic  pla  viand. 
This  month,  Senior  Editor  Keith  Fer- 
rell  takes  us  on  a  tour  of  that  silicon 
wonderland  in  "The  Japan  Factor." 

Americans  usually  think  of  enter- 
tainment when  they  think  of  Japanese 
electronics.  But  Japanese  electronics 
affect  business  too.  with  products  like 
notebook  computers,  handheld  infor- 
mation managers,  color  LCD  screens, 
and  stylus-based  input  devices. 

The  move  from  toys  to  tools  pre- 
sents formidable  challenges  even  to  a 
quick-moving  techno  nation  like  Ja- 
pan. But  it's  happening, 
and  we'll  certainly  feel 
the  impact  and  influ- 
ence of  Japanese  engi- 
neering in  our  home 
computing  devices  in 
the  coming  decade,  as 
we  have  over  the  last 
five  years  or  so. 

Japan  is  a  world 
leader  in  electronics  en- 
gineering, miniaturiza- 
tion, and  production. 
This  is  a  countrj'  that 
took  a  palm-size  cam- 
corder (the  new  Sony 
Handicam)  from  sche- 
matic drawing  to  fin- 
ished product  in  six 
months.  Most  American 
companies  would  take 
six  months  to  develop  a  ' 
survey  forconducting       _ 
market  research  into  the  EBSl 
profitability  of  such  a      f^^i 
camera. 

But  for  all  of  its 
technological  wizardry 
and  innovation,  there 
lies  at  the  heart  of  Japan 


COMPUTE 


a  puzzle:  How  is  it  that  a  country  so 
attuned  to  the  marvels  of  electronics 
and  computing  fails  to  embrace  per- 
sonal computers  on  a  national  scale? 
In  Japanese  businesses,  it's  common 
for  several  workers  to  share  a  com- 
puter or  a  dedicated  word  processor. 
At  home,  except  for  products  like  Fa- 
micom  (what  we  call  Nintendo)  and 
PC  Engine  (what  we  call  TurboGrafx- 
16),  personal  computers  are  as  rare  as 
hen's  teeth.  In  schools,  the  much-ad- 
mired Japanese  educational  system 
does  mostly  without  technology,  rely- 
ing instead  on  memorization  and 
discipline. 

Likewise,  attempts  to  link  Japa- 
nese citizens  through  communica- 
tions networks  have  yet  to  take  hold. 
Designed  to  make  possible  those  "cit- 
ies of  tomorrow"  we  all  remember 
from  countless  Walt  Disney  news- 
reels,  Japanese  telephone  and  data 
networks  designed  for  consumers 
have  fallen  victim  to  the  very  human 


trait  of  inertia.  To  update  an  old  ad- 
age, you  can  teach  an  old  dog  new 
tricks,  but  that  doesn't  mean  you'll  get 
a  spot  on  "David  Letterman." 

Some  industry'  sages  link  Japan's 
lackluster  acceptance  of  home  com- 
puters to  cultural  factors.  The  Japa- 
nese respect  group  effort  over  indivi- 
dual achievement,  for  example.  If 
that's  true,  then  sharing  one  computer 
among  several  workers  seems  a  logical 
way  of  conducting  business — one  tool 
that  enhances  a  the  group  effort. 

Despite  America's  emphasis  on 
teamwork,  we  are  a  country  of  indi- 
viduals. We  drive  to  work  one  to  a 
car.  We  stress  the  personal  in  personal 
computer.  We  dream  of  the  big  play  at 
work  and  at  school,  that  moment 
when  we're  singled  out  from  our  peers 
as  having  made  a  significant  contribu- 
tion. Anyone  who  thinks  American 
work  groups  would  be  happy  to  share 
personal  computers  has  never  stood 
in  line  at  the  fax  machine. 

The  lagging  home 
computer  community  in 
Japan  has  probably  as 
much  to  do  with  the 
Japanese  language  as  it 
does  with  cultural  pero- 
gatives.  Translating  key- 
board commands  from 
kanji  to  computerspeak 
is  a  formidable  chal- 
lenge. Innovative  solu- 
tions like  handwriting 
recognition  and  touch 
screens  lead  the  new 
wave  of  Japanese 
computers. 

Japan's  focus  on 
group  effort,  and  a  siz- 
able contribution  from 
its  government,  have  fii- 
eled  that  country's  tech- 
nological rise.  Its  fusion 
of  consumer  electronics 
with  telecommunications 
and  computers  promises 
to  reinvent  the  way  we 
work  with  our  machines. 
In  the  end,  it  may  re- 
define the  way  we  work 
with  each  other.  0

Where  in  TV  Guide  Is 
Carmen  Sandiego? 

That  dastardly  international  ttiief,  Carmen  Sandiego,  is  back.  But  don't 
look  for  her  in  your  local  software  store;  she  was  most  recently  spotted 
hiding  out  near  Mr.  Rogers'  neighborhood. 

Starting  in  the  fall  of  1 991 ,  Carmen  will  have  her  own  television 
show  on  PBS,  developed  by  WGBH  of  Boston,  WQED  of  Pittsburgh, 
and  Broderbund.  In  this  educational  game  show,  three  teams  will  race 
to  recover  an  exotic  treasure  swiped  by  the  infamous  Carmen  San- 
diego and  then  to  catch  Carmen  herself.  To  locate  Carmen  and  the  loot, 
the  detective  teams  must  answer  geography-related  questions  and  de- 
duce locations  from  clues  disclosed  on  an  electronic  game  board. 

"One  in  seven  Americans  can- 
not locate  the  Soviet  Union  or  Pacific 
Ocean  on  a  map  of  the  world,"  ex- 
plained Kate  Taylor,  WGBH's  co- 
executive  producer  of  children  and 
family  programs. "  'Where  in  the 
World  Is  Carmen  Sandiego?'  will  make 
geographic  information  exciting 
through  the  engaging  game-show 
format." 

Carmen's  half-hour  game  show 
will  be  seen  Monday  through  Fri- 
day on  most  PBS  affiliates.  Mean- 
while, the  Carmen  Sandiego  series  of 
educational  computer  games,  intro- 
duced in  1985,  has  sold  nearly  2  million  copies.  Broderbund  isn't  saying 
where  Carmen's  next  computer  caper  will  take  place,  but  industry  talk 
has  it  that  Carmen's  next  heist  may  take  place  in  outer  space.

If  you've  been  waiting  with  bated  breath  for  TV  Sports  Baseball,  you 
might  want  to  give  it  up  and  switch  to  ESPN.  Although  the  program 
has  been  advertised  for  months,  Cinemaware  says  it  won't  be  on  retail 
shelves  for  a  while  yet. 

"We've  pulled  development  back  in-house  so  that  we  can  make 
enhancements  to  the  program,"  said  Sam  Pool,  a  Cinemaware  spokes- 
man. He  said  the  company  wants  to  add  a  number  of  features  to  the 
program  to  ensure  that  it  meets  the  standards  set  for  the  TV  Sports 
line,  Cinemaware  currently  plans  to  release  Amiga  and  MS-DOS  ver- 
sions of  the  program  in  April  1991. 

Meanwhile,  Beyond  Software,  an  independent  game  developer 
that  did  early  work  on  TV  Sports  Baseball,  filed  a  $20  million  lawsuit 
against  Cinemaware  last  July,  Beyond  Software  claims  that  Cinema- 
ware relinquished  its  rights  to  the  baseball  game  when  it  canceled 
Beyond's  development  contract. 

"In  the  end,  we  know  we're  the  ones  who  designed  the  game  and 
that  we  own  the  rights  to  publish  it.  We  need  the  help  of  the  legal  sys- 
tem to  get  the  truth  out  in  the  open,"  said  Beyond's  Don  Daglow. 

Pool  said  that  the  dispute  between  the  two  companies  is  currently 
being  handled  through  contract  arbitration,  and  he  doesn't  anticipate 
that  it  will  delay  the  release  of  TV  Sports  Baseball.  Maybe  we'll  see  it 
by  spring  training.

Ultima  Sound 

In  the  April  1990  issue  o{  COM- 
PUTE!, in  the  review  of  Ukima  VI  (p. 
84),  I  found  a  statement  to  be  confus- 
ing. Shay  Addams  states  that  when  a 
spell  is  cast,  the  player  will  hear  the 
spell  names  spoken  aloud  as  digitized 
voices.  Also,  according  to  the  review, 
there  are  amazing  sound  effects  and 
music  lo  be  heard  if  the  user  has  a  Ro- 
land MD-32  or  an  Ad  Lib  sound 
board.  I  own  an  IBM  compatible  (AT) 
and  have  a  Sound  Blaster  music  card 
by  Creative  Labs,  which  it  claims  is 
Ad  Lib-compatible.  When  playing  Ul- 
tima VI,  I  hear  plenty  of  music  but  no 
digitized  voices  when  casting  spells. 
Additionally,  the  only  sound  effects  I 
hear  are  through  my  PC  speaker.  I 
called  Origin,  and  the  reps  stated  that 
there  were  not  any  digitized  voices  to 
be  heard  when  a  spell  was  cast.  Thus, 
my  question  is  Are  there  or  are  there 
not  any  digitized  voices  to  be  heard 
when  a  spell  is  cast?  I  would  appreci- 
ate a  brief  reply  if  at  all  possible. 

KEVIN  M,  CODLIN 
NEWARK.  OH 

Shay  Addams  responds: 
Yes,  you  can  hear  dozens  of  digi- 
tized voices  when  casting  spells  in 
Ultima  VI — if  your  computer  has 
50  megs  of  extended  RAM,  a 
20,000- meg  hard  disk  and  a  Rad 
Lib  sound  board.  But  since  these 
peripherals  are  unavailable  outside 
my  own  twisted  imagination,  I  may 
as  well  reveal  the  true  reason  my 
review  alleged  the  presence  of  said 
digitized  voices:  I  made  a  mistake. 
True,  it  is  the  first  one  in  my  career, 
but  embarrassing  nonetheless.  So 
embarrassing,  in  fact,  that  I  feel 
compelled  to  elaborate.  The  myth  of 
digitized  voices  in  Ultima  VI 
emerged  during  a  private  showing 
of  a  beta  version  of  the  game  at 
Origin  headquarters  in  Austin,  Tex- 
as. While  casting  a  slew  of  spells,  I 
did  indeed  hear  unerringly  similar 
names  shouted  aloud — but  learned 
only  after  writing  the  review  that  the 
voice  I'd  heard  was  none  other  than 
that  of  Ultima  VI'^  creator,  Rich- 

ard Garriott,  who  was  conducting 
Origin 's  Latin  classes  in  an  adjoin- 
ing office.  His  teaching  methods  in- 
volve shouting  Latin  phrases  and 
then  their  English  equivalents.  The 
lessons  are  required  training  for  all 
employees   working  at   adventure 
game  companies.  There,  it's  all  out 
in  the  open  and  I  feel  much  better. 
Now  can  I  go  home? 

On  or  Off? 

Is  it  really  preferable  to  leave  my  com- 
puter on  all  of  the  time?  I  have  been 
using  my  home  system  daily  for  2  to  5 
hours,-  then  I  turn  it  off  until  the  next 
time  I  use  it.  But  I've  read  that  the 
strain  of  starting  up  is  actually  worse 
than  allowing  continued  operation. 
Since  the  life  of  my  hard  disk  is  finite, 
with  a  printed  lifespan  given  as 
MTBF,  Tm  confused  as  to  what  I 
should  do. 

Your  magazine  hits  the  spot  with 
me.  I've  been  using  a  computer  for 
only  six  months  and  still  stumble  over 
the  basic  concepts  of  day-to-day  com- 
puting. Your  articles  are  written  just 
for  me.  Thanks!

Actually,  your  question  can  be  an- 
swered a  variety  of  ways,  depending 
on  whom  you  ask.  Even  though  flip- 
ping the  power  switch  on  and  off  can 
shorten  the  life  of  a  system,  most 
computer  users  fear  power  surges 
that  can  lead  to  lost  data.  Therefore, 
they  turn  off  their  computers  at  the 
end  of  the  day. 

We  know  a  few  brave  souls  who 
never  turn  off  their  systems  and 
haven 't  suffered  any  disastrous  con- 
sequences. But  we  don't  take  chances 
where  our  hard  drive  data  is  con- 
cerned— even  though  it 's  backed  up. 

No  matter  which  path  you 
choose,  occasionally  a  system  locks 
up  and  must  be  restarted.  To  avoid 
flipping  the  power  switch,  use  the 
reset  button  if  you  have  one.  If  you 
don't  have  a  reset  button,  you  can 
press  Ctrl-Alt-Del  to  reboot.  If  that

Historical  Simulations 

I  am  a  relatively  inexperienced  IBM 
PS/2  computer  owner.  Because  of  my 
clear  lack  of  knowledge,  I  subscribed 
to  your  magazine  and  have  enjoyed 
every  informative  issue.  I  especially 
enjoy  your  consistent  reviews  of  new 
software  and  hardware.  As  fast  as  the 
market  changes,  your  magazine  man- 
ages to  keep  abreast  of  the  most  recent 
technology. 

I  am  very  interested  in  the  Unit- 
ed States'  Civil  War.  Would  you 
please  tell  me  how,  and  from  whom,  I 
might  be  able  to  get  some  quality  sim- 
ulation games  on  the  military  aspects 
of  the  Civil  War?  Last,  would  you  be 
so  kind  as  to  inform  me  of  any  other 
simulations  on  nineteenth-century 
American  history — such  as  the  cultur- 
al, social,  economic,  or  political  as- 
pects of  the  War  Between  the  States? 

MARK  C  BARLOON 
IOWA  CITY,  lA 

Senior  Editor  Keith  Ferrell 
responds: 

The  Civil  War  has  proved  a  fertile 
area  for  software  development,  with 
dozens  of  good  historical  simula- 
tions available.  Notable  among 
these  are  a  series  from  SSI  and 
another  from  SSG.  My  personal  fa- 
vorites include  SSI's  Rebel  Charge 
at  Chickamauga,  and  the  first  vol- 
ume of  SSG's  Decisive  Battles  of 
the  American  Civil  War.  Many  of 
these  games  are  available  from 
mail-order  companies  or  through 
software  retailers. 

These  are  primarily  battlefield 
simulations;  as  far  as  I  know,  no 
one  has  as  yet  focused  on  the  eco- 
nomic and  social  sides  of  the  con- 
flict. Developers,  how  about  it? 

Selling  Your  Computer 

I  recently  bought  an  ALR  powerflex 
to  replace  the  6-year-oId  Texas  Instru- 
ments Professional  Computer  I  had 
been  using.  The  TI  is  still  a  fully  func- 
tional 8088  with  a  14-inch  color  mon- 
itor and  graphics  capability.  It's  still 


useful,  but  with  the  ALR  around,  the 
TI  is  just  an  oversized  paperweight. 

I  know  some  people  give  their  old 
stuff  away  or  donate  it  to  charity.  But 
since  my  budget  allowed  only  the 
rock-bottom  .ALR,  I  have  to  at  least 
try  to  squeeze  the  price  of  a  few  op- 
tions out  of  the  old  TL 

The  number  of  old  machines 

must  be  growing  rapidly.  Is  there  a 

real  market  for  old  equipment,  and,  if 

so,  where?

Alas,  with  the  rapid  advances  in 
computer  technology,  depreciation 
is  rapid,  and  it's  difficult  to  get  the 
price  you  might  like  for  your  older 
computer.  But  it's  certainly  not  im- 
possible to  sell  it,  and  you  have  a 
number  of  options.  Remember  that 
plenty  of  computer  users  can  man- 
age very  well  with  an  808S  machine, 
especially  if  they  use  it  primarily  for 
text-based  word  processing  that 
doesn't  make  great  demands  on 
memory.  And  such  a  machine 
might  be  great  for  someone's  chil- 
dren to  use  for  homework  and 
games. 

If  you  have  access  to  a  modem, 
a  bulletin  board  system  is  a  great 
place  to  advertise  your  older  com- 
puter. Computer  user  groups  also 
bring  your  offer  to  the  attention  of  a 
lot  of  computer  enthusiasts.  In  some 
areas  of  the  country,  swap  meets 
offer  you  just  the  opportunity  to 
make  the  money  you  need — if  you 
can  avoid  the  temptation  to  spend  it 
on  other  equipment.  Don 't  overlook 
good  old-fashioned  cork-and- 
thumbtack  bulletin  boards  where 
you  work,  at  the  laundromat,  in 
apartment  complexes,  and  at  other 
locations  where  a  lot  of  people 
might  see  an  ad.  The  option  thai 
comes  to  mind  most  readily  but 
which  offers  perhaps  the  least  poten- 
tial is  classified  advertising. 

Whichever  options  you  choose, 
be  realistic  about  what  you  can  get 
and  Stan  out  just  a  little  high  to 
leave  room  for  dickering.

Thinner,  shorter,  smaller, 
lighter.  The  four  words  that 
guided  the  Japanese  consumer 
electronics  revolution  are  now 
being  applied  to  computers, 
with  startling  results.  Other 
adjectives  applicable  to 
Japanese  computers  include 
faster,  cheaper,  and  different. 

The  Japanese,  having 
committed  themselves  to  the 
creation  of  an  information- 
based  society,  are  ringing 
changes  on  the  nature, 
purposes,  and  goals  of 
computing.  Data  is  the  coin 
of  the  realm,  knowledge  the 
currency,  and  computer  power 
the  raw  material  on  which  the 
Japanese  economy  increasingly 


JAPAN  IS 

REINVENTING  THE 
COMPUTER— AND 
MAYBE  THE  FUTURE 


KEITH    FERRELL 


As  a  result,  Japanese  companies, 
trade  associations,  and  government 
ministries  are  shepherding  a  national 
move  toward  industries  and  endeav- 
ors far  removed  from  the  traditional 
manufacturing  on  which  so  much  of 
Japan's  growth  has  been  based.  Lack- 
ing ready  supplies  of  raw  materials  or 
easily  exploited  energy,  Japan  is  turn- 
ing inward,  seeking  to  exploit  mental 
rather  than  physical  resources. 

This  shift  is  inevitable  as  manu- 


facturing moves  offshore  in  search  of 
cheaper  labor.  The  transition  is  a  re- 
sponse to  competitive  pressure  from 
other  Pacific  Rim  nations  that  are  tak- 
ing their  turn  in  the  manufacturing 
spotlight. 

But  the  transition  also  reflects  the 
Japanese  character.  Pragmatic  and 
poetic  at  the  same  time,  the  Japanese 
are  evolving  a  vision  of  the  future 
with,  characteristically,  Japan  at  its 
center.  At  the  heari  of  this  new  future 


stands  Japanese  computer  technology. 

Such  a  future  doesn't  exclude  the 
rest  of  us.  Instead,  it  radiates  outward, 
touching  and  affecting  the  way  we  use 
computers,  the  way  computers  are  de- 
signed, the  way  we  interact  with  them. 

Over  the  next  few  years,  as  Japa- 
nese research  and  innovation  bear 
productive  fruit,  we'll  see  computers 
that  call  for  a  whole  new  generation  of 
adj  ecti ves — subtler,  softer,  fuzzier, 
friendlier.

NOVEMBER       1990 


First  Impressions 

At  first  glance,  Japan  appears  to  be  the 
most  computerized  nation  on  earth.  I 
mean,  it  has  to  be. . . . 

Stroll  down  any  street  in  any  ma- 
jor Japanese  city.  Glance  in  any  direc- 
tion and  you  can  tell  that  this  is  an 
electronics-  and  information-oriented 
society.  Not  even  New  York  has  as 
many  newsstands  and  bookstalls,  not 
even  Los  Angeles  as  many  billboards 
pushing  electronics  on  consumers. 

"Be  a  Laplopper!"  urges  a  poster 
common  on  Tokyo's  subways  and 
trains.  OA,  for  Office  .'Automation,  are 
common  initials  in  store  windows. 
NEC  has  for  years  endorsed  C  &  C — 
Computers  and  Communications — as 
its  corporate  watchwords.  Perhaps  in 
imitation,  other  companies  employ 
slogans  like  Think  &  Link.  An  impres- 
sive number  of  technology  malls 
showcase  the  latest  in  information 
technology. 

A  whole  area  of  Tokyo — .'\kiha- 
bara — glows  with  VDT  light;  here  you 
can  find  desktop  and  laptop  comput- 
ers of  all  different  shapes  and  sizes, 
along  with  dedicated  word  processors, 
printers,  and  all  manner  of  peripherals 
and  software. 

NEC's  new  headquarters  domi- 
nates a  portion  of  Tokyo's  skyline. 
Noticeable  at  first  for  the  great  gap  in 
its  middle — a  hole  that  allows  air  to 
flow  through  the  building  rather  than 
pushing  around  it — it's  also  one  of  the 
"smartest"  buildings  in  the  world. 
Information  systems  and  conduits 
were  built  into  the  structure  from  its 
conception, 

CD-ROM  discs  nestle  next  to 
Nintendo  and  other  game  cartridges 
in  toy  stores.  As  many  as  half  of  the 
worid's  CD-ROM  drives  are  in  Japa- 
nese homes,  connected  to  PC-Engine 
game  consoles. 

The  Japanese  have,  over  the  last 
decade,  come  to  dominate  most  of  the 
subsystems  that  make  up  desktop 
computers — from  silicon  chips  to 
drives,  from  floppy  disks  to  monitor 
technology.  Increasingly,  the  world  of 
computers  moves  to  a  Japanese  beat. 

Where  Are  Aii  the  Computers? 

Fewer  than  one-third  of  Japanese 
businesses  have  computers.  It's  not 
uncommon  even  in  large  corporations 
for  dozens  of  employees  to  share  ac- 
cess to  a  single  computer  or,  just  as 
likely,  a  single  dedicated  word 
processor. 

Home  computers  are  equally 
rare.  Despite  a  booming  economy,  a 
high  level  of  education,  and  access  to 
technology,  the  Japanese  haven't  in- 
vited the  computer  into  their  homes, 
After  an  initial  flurry  of  interest  in 
machines  such  as  NEC's  MSX,  Japa- 
nese consumers  shifted  their  purchas-

Interactive  Playland 


Mention  Japanese  software  to  average 
Westerners,  and  their  first  response  is 
likely  to  be  Games! 

With  good  reason.  Nintendo  is  argu- 
ably the  most  notable  Japanese  triumph 
in  the  American  computer  marl<et.  Cer- 
tainly it's  the  largest  Japanese  success  in 
software  marketing,  with  its  American 
arm  generating  revenue  that  dwarfs  that 
of  its  Washington-state  neighbor. 
Microsoft. 

It's  not  hard  to  see  why.  The  Japa- 
nese are  the  absolute  masters  of  arcade 
game  design  and  implementation.  Coin- 
op  parlors  can  be  found  on  virtually  every 
block,  although  it  must  be  admitted  that 
there  are  still  more  pachinko — Japanese 
pinball — parlors  than  video  arcades. 
Some  analog  games  take  awhile  to  die. 

But  pachinko,  despite  its  shiny  balls 
and  constant  clatter,  can't  compete  with 
the  ferocious  speed,  captivating  colors, 
and  superb  sound  of  Japanese  coin-op 
games.  They  look  different  from  ours  and, 
indeed,  must  sometimes  be  altered  a  bit 
for  foreign  export.  Japanese  arcade  play- 
ers prefer  more  stylized  characters,  for  in- 
stance. Japan  also  favors  games  that  are, 


believe  it  or  not,  more  violent  than  ours. 
Nudity  and  sex  are  more  common  in  Jap- 
anese arcade  games  than  those  in  the 
United  States. 

Alttiough  arcades  are  the  most  pop- 
ular Japanese  softvrare  games,  the  na- 
tion does  produce— and  import— its 
share  of  more  sophisticated  interactive 
entertainment.  Role-playing  games  are 
particularly  popular  here.  Origin's  Ultima, 
for  example,  is  imported  by  Pony  Canyon, 
a  division  of  Fujisankei,  the  conglomerate 
that  also  imported  Ronald  Reagan  to  Ja- 
pan. Something  of  a  cult  hit  in  Japan,  Ulti- 
ma has  sold  more  than  300,000  copies  in 
Nintendo  format  and  close  to  1 00,000  in 
various  computer  formats. 

Such  figures  are  high  for  disk-based 
computer  entertainment.  "It's  ironic," 
says  Yoichi  Erikawa,  president  o(  Koei, 
publisher  of  Nobunaga's  Ambition  and 
other  software  games,  "but  the  PC  enter- 
tainment market  is  about  the  same  size  in 
Japan  as  in  the  United  States.  You  have 
25  million  home  computers,  we  have 
about  3  million,  but  in  both  countries  sales 
of  50,000  to  100,000  copies  of  a  disk- 
based  game  make  it  a  major  hit,"

ing  power  to  dedicated  game 
machines  like  Nintendo's  Famicom, 
NEC's  PC-Engine,  and  SEGA's 
Genesis. 

While  some  of  these  consoles 
have  sprouted  computerlike  peripher- 
als, including  floppy  disk  drives,  CD- 
ROM  drives,  and  modems,  they  lack 
the  power  and  flexibility  Americans 
associate  with  desktop  computers. 

On  the  software  side,  selection  is 
eclectic  and,  often,  imported.  Lotus  I- 
2-3  is  the  top-selling  business  program 
in  Japan.  Ashton-Tate  and  Microsoft 
also  boast  strong  presences  here.  The 
Japanese  Personal  Computer  Soft- 
ware Association  (JPCSA)  boasts 
more  than  300  member  companies, 
yet  many  of  those  members  turn  to 
overseas  sources,  notably  China,  for 
the  actual  creation  of  programs. 

Some  analysts  attribute  Japan's 
reputed  difficulty  at  creating  personal 
computer  software  to  special  aspects 
of  the  Japanese  character.  The  coun- 
try is  group-oriented  rather  than  indi- 
vidual-oriented, these  analysts 
observe,  and  writing  software  is  tradi- 
tionally an  individualistic,  entrepre- 
neurial endeavor. 

It's  different  at  the  mainframe 
level.  Japan's  successes  and  innova- 
tions with  large  undertakings  such  as 
the  Fifth  Generation  Project  (see  side- 
bar) represent  software  ambition  and 
achievement  on  world-class  levels. 

Quick  Change 

Japan's  transition  to  an  information- 
based  society  has  come  quickly,  mov- 
ing in  four  decades  from  essentially  a 
postwar  standing  start  to  near  leader- 
ship in  heavy  manufacturing  such  as 
automobiles,  and  to  global  dominance 
in  silicon  chip  technology  (Matsu- 
shita, Hitachi,  and  Toshiba  all  intro- 
duced powerful  16-megabit  DRAM 
chips  before  their  American  competi- 
tors), consumer  electronics  (Sony, 
Panasonic,  JVC,  and  Sharp),  interna- 
tional banking  (Dai-Ichi  Kangyo  is 
the  world's  largest  bank;  in  1988,  nine 
of  the  world's  ten  largest  banks  were 
Japanese),  and  a  myriad  of  other  as- 
pects of  the  information  revolution. 

How  the  Japanese  have  achieved 
these  business  successes  remains  one 
of  the  most  hotly  debated  issues  in  in- 
ternational trade.  You  can't  open  an 
American  newspaper  or  turn  on  a  tele- 
vision without  encountering  an  edito- 
rial or  advertisement  that  attributes 
Japanese  success  to  unfair  trade  prac- 
tices or  government  bogeymen  such 
as  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade 
and  Industry  (MITI). 

Equally  prevalent  is  the  myth 
that  the  Japanese  don't  innovate,  that 
their  phenomenal  success  is  a  result  of 
their  ability  to  copy  or  synthesize  the 
achievements  of  other  nations.  In  de- 


MITI  and  an  Information-Based  Japan 


Japan  understands  the  importance  of 
goats,  of  setting  them  and  working  to 
acfiieve  them.  The  Ministry  of  Internation- 
ai  Trade  and  Industry  (MITI)  plays  an  im- 
portant role  in  establishing  those  goals 
and  has  helped  keep  a  substantial  portion 
of  industry,  education,  and  commerce  fo- 
cused on  the  information  industry  and  its 
economic  and  social  potential. 

Too  often  portrayed  in  the  Western 
press  as  a  malevolent  manipulator  exert- 
ing complete  control  over  the  Japanese 
economy,  M\H  is  In  reality  something 
more  complex.  While  Its  influence  can't 
be  doubted,  the  Ministry  serves  more  as 
coordinator  than  controller,  cajoling  and 
encouraging  Japanese  industries  and  in- 
stitutions to  pursue  the  unified  paths  that 
have  led  to  Japanese  dominance  of  vari- 
ous industries. 

Many  of  those  paths  are  aimed  at 
smoothing  Japan's  transition  to  an  infor- 
mation-based economy.  A  MITI  project  in 
the  early  seventies  defined  the  nation's  in- 
dustrial goals  for  the  decade: 

•  Investment  in  R  &  D  aimed  at  increasing 
Japanese  capabilities  in  computers, 
aerospace  products,  robots,  nuclear 
power,  ocean  exploitation,  and 
chemicals 

•  Development  of  "high  processing"  in- 
dustries (QA,  communications,  numeri- 
cal control  machine  tools,  educational 
equipment) 

•  Expansion  of  the  fashion  industries 
{clothing,  furniture,  electronics) 


•  Development  of  knowledge  industries, 
including  information  management, 
information  supply,  and  education,  from 
software  and  video  products  to 
consulting 

MITI  laid  out  the  thrust  of  those  goals 
in  1971  with  a  statement  from  its  Industri- 
al Structure  Council.  Every  effort  must  be 
made,  the  Council  urged,  to  move  Japan 
from  the  pursuit  of  industrial  and  econom- 
ic growth  to  more  fully  utilizing  the  infor- 
mational tools  that  made  (hat  growth 
possible.  Guiding  all  of  the  effort  would  be 
the  goal  of  an  economy  built  upon  mental 
resources  rather  than  on  natural  ones. 

TvTO  decades  later,  the  achievement 
of  those  goals  can  be  witnessed  in 
stores,  office  buildings,  banks,  and  insti- 
tutions throughout  the  world.  But  even  as 
the  seventies  unfolded,  MITI  and  ottier 
Japanese  organizations  had  their  eyes  on 
the  eighties — and  beyond. 

By  March  1 980,  MITI  had  codified  a 
new  vision.  More  ambitious,  the  Ministry 
addressed  four  major  areas:  energy  con- 
servation, improvement  of  living  condi- 
tions and  social  stability,  development  of 
new  technologies,  and  the  nurturing  of 
creative  and  knowledge-based  industries. 

As  the  nineties  unfold,  MITI  will  once 
more  unveil  its  goals  for  the  nation  and  its 
economy.  There  is  little  doubt  that  those 
goals  will  be  even  more  information  and 
computer  related,  designed  to  lay  the 
groundwork  for  a  twenty-first-century 
Japan. 


bating  the  accuracy  or  inaccuracy  of 
such  charges,  it's  helpfijl  to  look  at 
some  points  related  to  the  computer 
industry. 

•  NEC  was  building  electronic  com- 
puters in  Japan  as  early  as  1958.  The 
company  was  marketing  transistor- 
ized computers  in  Japan  a  year 
before  American  companies  entered 
the  Japanese  computer  market. 

•  In  1971,  Japanese  plants  were  pro- 
ducing 1 K  DRAM  chips  only  a  few 
months  after  Intel  began  production 
in  the  United  States. 

•  Japan  invested  more  heavily  in 
CMOS  (Complimentary  Metal  Ox- 
ide Silicon)  technology  than  did  the 
United  States,  perceiving  the  bene- 
fits of  such  technology  to  creating 
those  thinner,  smaller,  shorter,  and 
lighter  consumer  electronics  prod- 
ucts that  lay  at  the  heart  of  Japanese 
industrial  strategy. 

•  As  a  result  of  Japan's  CMOS  exper- 
tise, Tandy  turned  to  the  Japanese  in 
1 98 1  for  the  technology  that  made 
possible  the  Tandy  100,  the  first  lap- 
top computer. 

•  LCD  technology,  which  is  bringing 
ever  sharper  and  more  effective 
screens  to  laptop  computers,  found 
its  first  real  market  in  Japan,  where 
it  was  used  for  watch  displays. 


No  one  who's  bought  a  Walkman 
can  say  that  the  Japanese  aren't  inno- 
vative. Fusion,  rather  than  synthesis, 
more  accurately  describes  the  Japa- 
nese melding  of  technologies  into  new 
products,  which  in  turn  create  new 
markets. 

Keyboards  and  Kanji 

Consumer  electronics  is  one  thing, 
consumer  computers  quite  another.  In 
Japan,  personal  computers  face  one 
large  hurdle:  the  Japanese  written  lan- 
guage. Even  the  typewriter  never 
found  great  success  in  Japan  for  the 
simple  reason  that  the  character-based 
Japanese  language  doesn't  lend  itself 
easily  to  keyboards. 

In  the  West,  technology  capable 
of  manipulating  the  alphabet  and  the 
numeric  system  proved  relatively 
simple  to  develop:  26  letters,  ten  dig- 
its, and  handful  of  grammatical  and 
other  symbols. 

Our  alphabet  was  fairly  simple 
for  typists  to  master  the  familiar 
QWERTY  or  less  familiar  Dvorak 
keyboards.  Conversion  of  the  alpha- 
bet to  microcomputers  was  likewise  a 
relatively  simple  matter.  The  Ameri- 
can Standard  Code  for  Information 
Interchange  (ASCII)  accommodates 
1 28  characters  and  symbols,  handling 
them  in  as  many  bytes.  (Extended 


26      COMPUTE         NOVEMBEI?       1990 


ASCII,  developed  by  IBM,  offers  256 
symbols.) 

Written  Japanese  is  complex  and 
multilayered.  The  Japanese  have  liter- 
ally thousands  of  characters  that  any 
keyboard  or  software  program  must 
accommodate.  Depending  on  which 
expert  you  listen  to,  there  are  between 
3,000  and  4,000  kanji  symbols,  requir- 
ing memory  on  the  order  of  half  a 
megabyte  just  for  the  character  set. 

Most  Japanese  keyboards  include 
both  Roman  and  kana  alphabets. 
Kana  is  a  phonetic  lettering  system 
that's  simpler  than  kanji  but  requires 
conversion  into  the  larger  character 
system. 

But  even  that  system  has  its 
drawbacks.  One  Japanese  editor  dem- 
onstrated for  me  the  dilemma  of  typ- 
ing in  Japanese.  After  typing  a  Roman 
or  kana  character,  he  was  presented 
with  a  choice  of  kanji  characters,  from 
which  he  selected  the  one  most  suited 
to  his  meaning.  Then  he  entered  the 
next  character  and  made  his  next  se- 
lection. It  takes  several  operations  to 
enter  a  fairly  simple  word. 

Japanese  word  processing  soft- 
ware is  faster  than  Japanese  typewrit- 
ers— but  not  by  much.  The  subtleties 
of  Japanese  script  are  beautifully 
adopted  to  brush  strokes  and  paper, 
where  nuance  and  style  color  each 
character.  Keyboards,  by  definition, 
eliminate  nuance  and  replace  it  with  a 
rigid  structure  that's  in  some  ways 
most  un-Japanese. 

These  aspects  of  Japanese  consid- 
ered, is  it  any  wonder  that  the  fax  ma- 
chine, which  was  after  all  Western 
technology,  took  off  in  Japan  before  it 
did  here?  With  a  fax,  Japanese  busi- 
nesspeople  could  send  handwritten 
correspondence  electronically — the 
best  of  both  worlds.

should  be  only  slightly  less  surprising 
that  the  Macintosh,  with  its  graphical, 
mouse-driven  interface,  has  captured 
several  percentage  points  of  the  Japa- 
nese microcomputer  market. 

An  Elusive  Standard 

Despite  keyboard  and  software  dilem- 
mas, there  are  millions  of  PCs  in  Ja- 
pan. The  country  produces  about  2.5 
million  PCs  each  year,  about  1.5  mil- 
lion of  those  for  its  domestic  market. 

NEC  dominates  the  Japanese 
microcomputer  market  in  a  way  that 
not  even  IBM  dominates  the  Ameri- 
can market.  With  more  than  50  per- 
cent market  share,  NEC's  9800  series 
of  PCs  have  become  the  de  facto  Japa- 
nese standard. 

Still,  a  standard  such  as  MS-DOS 
eludes  the  Japanese,  Whereas  IBM's 
chief  competitors  produce  microcom- 
puters that  run  the  same  software  as 
Big  Blue's,  each  of  NEC's  competitors 
markets  its  own  proprietary  BIOS 
(Basic  Input/Output  System,  that  part 
of  the  computer's  operating  system 
that  communicates  directly  with  the 
hardware).  ^ 

990  COMPUTE       27 


As  a  result,  there  are  over  1 00  dif- 
ferent BIOSs  in  Japan.  Software  writ- 
ten for  one  must  be  at  the  least 
tweaked — and  in  some  cases  sharply 
modified — to  run  on  another.  Japa- 
nese computer  makers  resolve  these 
differences  by  including  software  with 
their  machines. 

The  system  shows  little  sign  of 
changing.  NEC  is  obviously  happy 
with  its  huge  share  of  the  market  and 
has  worked  to  discourage  9800  series 
clones  and  compatibles  from  other 
manufacturers. 

Still,  other  standards  are  spring- 
ing up.  Fujitsu,  Japan's  second  largest 
microcomputer  manufacturer,  has  en- 
joyed moderate  success  with  its  FM- 
Towns  machine,  a  386-based  system 
with  a  built-in  CD-ROM  drive.  Al- 
though originally  aimed  at  the  enter- 
tainment audience,  FM-Towns  has 
lately  been  repositioned  to  take  better 
advantage  of  the  growing  business  in- 
terest in  CD-ROM  materials. 

It's  possible  that  we  will  in  the  fu- 
ture see  a  more  unified  computer 
standard  in  Japan.  TRON  (The  Real 
Operating  Nucleus)  for  example,  is  a 
joint  venture  of  NEC,  Matsushita,  Fu- 
jitsu, NTT,  Toshiba,  Hitachi,  Mitsu- 
bishi, and  Oki  Electric,  aimed  at 
creating  an  open  computer  architec- 
ture that  accommodates  Japanese 
needs  and  requirements. 

.Announced  in  1986,  TRON  is  in- 
tended to  bring  various  electronic  de- 
vices and  appliances  together.  This 
includes  not  only  business  computers, 
but  also  smart  copiers  and  fax  ma- 
chines, as  well  as  household  appli- 
ances such  as  VCRs  and  telephones. 
The  goal  of  TRON  is  nothing  less 
than  the  unified  linking  and  automa- 
tion of  every  electronic  aspect  of  Japa- 
nese life. 

But  despite  increased  microcom- 
puter power  and  the  promise  of  pro- 
jects such  as  TRON,  Japanese  com- 
puters stitl  haven't  come  home.  Many 
opinion  shapers  feel  that  they  won't 
until  prices  come  down  and  perceived 
need  goes  up.  And  for  that  to  happen, 
there  will  need  to  be  a  revolution  in 
Japanese  computer  education. 

Matters  of  Education 

Few  nations  take  the  matter  of  educa- 
tion as  seriously  as  does  Japan,  The 
country's  educational  successes,  test 
scores,  and  overall  literacy  are  fre- 
quently cited  as  playing  an  inestima- 
bly large  part  in  honing  the  nation's 
competitive  edge. 

(At  the  same  time,  the  uniformity 
of  basic  education  throughout  Japan 
is  invoked  by  some  observers  as  an 
explanation  for  the  countr>''s  failure 
to  produce  as  many  first-rate  software 
designers  and  programmers  as  the 
United  States  produces.) 


According  to  Yozo  Shimizu,  ex- 
ecutive director  of  the  JPCSA,  person- 
al computers  have  only  lately  been 
perceived  as  vital  to  basic  education. 
Shimizu  and  his  organization  are  lob- 
bying hard  for  a  massive  government 
investment  in  computer  hardware 
and  software.  If  fully  undertaken,  the 
investment  would  require  billions  of 
dollars.  The  goal  is  one  computer  for 
every  two  Japanese  students  by  the 
mid-199Ds. 

The  JPCSA's  plan  calls  for  the 
computers  to  be  phased  into  the 
schools  starting  at  the  lowest  grades 
and  with  the  youngest  students.  "This 
approach  is  the  fastest  route  to  a  full 
generation  of  computer-literate  Japa- 
nese," Shimizu  says. 

For  the  plan  to  work,  there  must 
be  a  decline  in  PC  prices.  PCs  in  Ja- 
pan cost  perhaps  twice  as  much  as 
comparable  models  in  North  Ameri- 
ca. The  JPCSA  is  pressuring  hardware 
manufacturers  to  reduce  prices  as  a 
means  of  helping  to  create  an  educa- 
tion market  for  computers.  If  that 
market  comes  to  life,  and  the  number 
of  computers  in  schools  does  increase, 
Shimizu  feels  certain  that  Japanese 
parents  will  prove  more  willing  to 
purchase  computers  for  the  home. 

OH.OA! 

The  other  great  spur  to  increased 
numbers  of  home  computers  in  Japan 
is  the  country's  current  awareness  of 
the  benefits  of  OA. 

OA  is  perhaps  the  most  common 
acronym  in  Japan.  You  see  it  every- 
where, on  billboards  and  magazine 
covers,  in  store  windows,  and  on  sub- 
way and  train  placards.  Having  devel- 
oped the  technology  and  products  that 
play  so  vital  a  part  in  automating  of- 
fices throughout  the  world,  Japan 
seems  at  last  ready  to  automate  its 
own. 

Part  of  this  readiness  is  sheer 
pragmatism.  As  Japan  moves  to  the 
forefront  of  a  world  economy,  the 
amounts  of  data  moving  through  the 
nation  have  multiplied.  Traditional 
paper  shuffling  and  report  moving 
can't  keep  up  with  the  fast-paced 
information  age  Japan  has  helped 
create. 

There's  a  cultural  aspect  at  work 
here  as  well.  Judging  by  television  and 
print  ads  in  Japan,  mastery  of  OA  is 
considered  a  boon  to  a  career.  OA  ads 
feature  sharply  dressed,  obviously 
prosperous  young  people.  OA  is  a  key 
to  a  better  future,  a  future  that  may 
also  embrace  the  home.  A  recent  To- 
kyo computer  show  featured  a  large 
and  well-attended  exhibit  extolling  the 
virtues  of  that  most  Western  of 
rooms,  the  home  office.  By  persuad- 
ing people  that  household  OA  offers 
the  chance  to  get  more  work  done 


The  Next  Generation 

Among  the  most  ambitious  and  well- 
l<nown  of  Japan's  computer  research 
undertal(ings  is  the  enormous  Fifth 
Generation  Project. 

Launclied  in  the  early  1980s,  Fifth 
Generation  is  nothing  less  than  the  at- 
tempt to  create  software  and  hardware 
that  will  permit  natural  language— Japa- 
nese or  English — communication  and 
interaction  with  computers. 

A  joint  venture  of  the  Japanese 
government  and  leading  Japanese 
computer  and  electronics  companies, 
the  Fifth  Generation  Project  is  coordi- 
nated through  the  Institute  of  Next-Gen- 
eration Computer  Technology  (ICOT.) 

There  are  three  basic  thrusts  to  the 
Fifth  Generation  Project: 

•  Creation  of  a  huge  knowledge  base  on 
which  Rfth  Generation  computers  can 
draw  in  order  to  reason  their  way 
through  queries.  While  this  reasoning 
takes  the  form  of  if/then  statements  fa- 
miliar to  expert  systems  and  artificial- 
intelligence  programmers,  the 
Japanese  knowledge  base  is  designed 
to  include  graphics,  video,  and  audio 
information,  all  of  it  linked  and  accessi- 
ble to  users  of  Fifth  Generation 
computers. 

•  Development  of  problem-solving  soft- 
ware capable  of  humanlike  reasoning. 
Using  the  Prolog  computer  program- 
ming language,  ICOT's  researchers 
are  seeking  to  create  intelligent  sys- 
tems capable  of  making  a  billion  logical 
inferences  per  second. 

•  Design  and  manufacture  of  (he  hard- 
ware necessary  to  make  the  system 
effective.  This  includes  a  new  genera- 
tion of  terminals  capable  of  accepting 
voice,  handwritten,  touch,  and  other 
types  of  commands.  While  there 
doubtless  will  t>e  keyboards  for  Fifth 
Generation  computers,  they're  likely 
tie  severly  outnumbered.

while  spending  more  time  with  the 
family,  Japanese  computer  makers 
may  sell  more  computers. 

Getting  Connected 

The  real  key  to  an  information-based 
Japan  may  well  prove  to  be  NTT — 
the  nation's  telephone  company. 

A  private  corporation  since 
April,  1 985,  NTT  has  long  been 
among  the  most  aggressive  advocates 
of  information  technologies.  Unlike 
American  telecommunications  giants, 
most  notably  AT&T,  NTT  is  unfet- 
tered by  restrictions  on  delivering 
information  as  well  as  providing  com- 
munications services.  And  infor- 
mation may  prove  to  be  NTT's 
number-one  product. 

Among  the  most  ambitious  of  the 
telephone  corporation's  projects  is 
INS  (Information  Network  System), 
that's  aimed,  like  TRON,  at  all  users. 

Between  1984  and  1987,  NTT  es- 
tablished prototype  INS  communities 


in  Musashino  and  Mitaka,  suburbs  of 
Tokyo.  The  systems  ofTered  home 
shopping  with  both  department  store 
and  grocery  services,  teleconferencing 
capability,  telecommuting  for  those 
whose  jobs  were  geared  to  it,  govern- 
ment services,  as  well  as  facsimile  ser- 
vices that  would  serve  educational 
needs.  One  can  imagine  Japanese  stu- 
dents offering  hypermodern  excuses 
to  their  teachers:  "The  fax  ate  my 
homework." 

Admittedly  optimistic,  NTT  sees 
revenues  from  combined  phone,  fax, 
data,  telex,  and  video  throughput  on 
INS  reaching  hundreds  of  billions  of 
dollars  by  the  mid- 1 990s. 

It's  one  thing  to  plan  for  such  a 
society- wide  embrace  of  new  technol- 
ogies, and  quite  another  to  make  it 
come  true. 

Hi-Ovis  (Higashi-Ikoma  Optical 
Visual  Information  System)  was  a 
prototype  home  information  network 
developed  in  the  late  1970s  and  early 
1980s.  Created  in  partnership  with 
MITI,  Fujitsu  (which  provided  com- 
puters), Sumitomo  (optical  fiber),  and 
Matsushita  (audio/visual  equipment), 
Hi-Ovis  promised  to  deliver  2-way  in- 
teractive communications  with  video, 
digital  data,  and  audio  capabilities. 

In  household  tests,  however,  the 
promise  of  Hi-Ovis  seemed  to  far  out- 
weigh the  public's  desire  to  use  the 
system.  While  30  percent  of  the  test 
subjects  watched  the  introductory 
program  telling  how  the  system  could 
be  used,  less  than  5  percent  actually 
took  advantage  of  the  system's  inter- 
active services. 

The  Japanese,  though,  have  a 
tendency  to  learn  from  their  proto- 
types, assimilate  what  they've  learned, 
and  move  beyond  them  to  the  next 
level.  INS  is  a  step  beyond  Hi-Ovis. 
It  may  be  that  another  step — or 
several — is  required  before  a  truly 
consumer-friendly,  consumer-useful 
information  system  is  developed. 

Rising  Sun 

The  nineties  could  well  be  the  Japa- 
nese decade  in  computing.  Certainly 
that's  been  the  national  goal. 

Projects  such  as  TRON  and  Fifth 
Generation  are  the  most  dramatic 
manifestations  of  Japan's  pursuit  of 
that  goal  but,  like  the  tip  of  an  iceberg, 
they  represent  only  a  firaction  of  the 
exciting  computer-related  research, 
development,  and  product  design  go- 
ing on  in  Japan.  Lessons  learned  in 
decades  of  consumer  electronics  man- 
ufacturing and  marketing  are  generat- 
ing products  and  approaches  that  are 

Smaller.  A  whole  new  generation 
of  "intelligent"  cards  is  being  devel- 
oped by  companies  like  Maxell.  These 
cards,  barely  larger  than  a  credit  card, 
can  hold  reams  of  data  and  are  finding

applications  as  varied  as  maintaining 
individual  health  records  and  employ- 
ment histories. 

Thinner.  The  latest  laptops  are 
nothing  if  not  Japanese  in  design  and 
construction.  With  sharper  color 
monitors,  more  processing  and  stor- 
age power,  and  more  responsive  key- 
boards, notebook-size  laptops  will 
soon  make  "luggables"  and  even  tra-

Shorter.  The  latest  high-defini- 
tion television  sets  take  up  barely  half

caught  widespread  consumer  aware- 
ness, several  Japanese  companies 
have  joined  together  to  increase  the 
technology's  visibility.  CD-ROM  dis- 
plays— using  HDTV — are  appearing 
at  art  museums  and  exhibitions 


throughout  Japan. 

Beyond  Tomorrow 

Poised  on  the  cusp  of  the  next  millen- 
nium, the  Japanese  seem  to  have  it 
all.  They  own  the  chip  market,  are 
dominant  in  display  technology,  and 
are  exploring  new  ground  in  artificial 
intelHgence  and  parallel  processing. 

What's  happening  to  the  com- 
puter is  classic  Japanese  fusion.  Ideas 
and  innovations  are  being  bom,  nur- 
tured, modified  and  melded.  New 
computers,  new  approaches  to  soft- 
ware, new  products,  and  new  areas  of 
products  are  coming  to  life. 

The  result?  No  single  result. 
Evolution  doesn't  end,  it  branches. 
We'll  see  the  Japanese  approach  to 
computing  absorbed  into  the  ap- 
proaches other  nations  take  toward 
computing,  even  as  Japan  absorbs 
other  approaches. 

On  and  on — unto  the  fifth  and 
sixth  and  all  the  subsequent  genera- 
tions, Japanese  and  otherwise,  that 
give  gradual,  constant  rise  to  a  new, 
multifaceted  and  multinational,  world

puter in  Japan  that  offers  compatibil- 
ity with  the  dominant  Japanese  PC 
standard, 

"We've  always  felt  that  the  Pacif- 
ic Rim  provided  an  opportunity," 
says  Jim  Ashbrook,  the  company's 
vice  president  for  product  marketing, 
"Although  that  opportunity  trails  the 
U.S,  in  terms  of  PC  penetration,  it's 
still  a  very  large  market  with  great 
growth  potential." 

The  company  identified  the  Pa- 
cific Rim  as  a  target  several  years  ago 
and  has  taken  the  time  to  build  the  in- 
frastructure necessary  to  succeed  in 
business  there.  Take,  for  example,  one 
of  the  key  rules  of  global  competition: 
Don't  put  too  much  distance  between 
your  manufacturing  facilities  and 
your  marketing  efforts.  It's  a  rule  AST 
follows  closely, 

"We  started  in  Hong  Kong,  but 
we  also  put  a  factory  there,"  Ashbrook 
says.  The  company  opened  a  Hong 
Kong  sales  office  at  the  same  time. 
The  investment  has  paid  off.  "That 
particular  segment  of  our  business  has 
grown  very  rapidly,"  he  says,  AST  has 
since  expanded  into  Taiwan,  Austra- 
ha,  and  Japan. 

The  Japanese  market  presents 
several  challenges  to  a  PC  manufac- 
turer. Unlike  in  the  United  States, 
there  exists  no  single  PC  standard 
(such  as  MS-DOS). 

"The  PC  AT  MS-DOS  standard 
dominates  in  the  U.S.  to  the  exclusion 
of  almost  everything  else  other  than 
Apple,"  Ashbrook  points  out.  "In  Ja- 
pan, the  NEC  98  standard  has  over  50 
percent  of  the  market,  and  the  rest  of 
the  market  is  fragmented  to  the  point 
where  no  one  else  has  more  than  5 
percent.  So  there  are  more  standards, 
but  there  is  still  a  dominant  player, 
which  is  what  we  have  focused  in  on." 


NEC's  standard  is  not  as  open  as 
IBM's.  Companies  can't  simply  dupli- 
cate the  NEC  BIOS  and  market  NEC- 
compatible  computers.  Nor  does  NEC 
license  its  BIOS.  In  order  to  produce 
an  NEC-compatible  computer,  AST 
spent  two  years  working  with  a  Japa- 
nese company  to  develop  an  NEC- 
compatible  BIOS  that  respected 
NEC's  proprietary  technology. 

Then,  AST  went  one  step  farther. 
In  addition  to  offering  NEC  compati- 
bility, the  AST  Dual  SX/16  is  fully 
MS-DOS  compatible. 


Jim  Ashbrook 

"Our  position  is  that  [this  ap- 
proach] gives  you  the  best  of  both  li- 
braries," Ashbrook  says. 

The  dual  system  is  already 
garnering  some  interest  in  Japan. 
Ashbrook  met  recently  with  represen- 
tatives of  a  Japanese  software  associa- 
tion. "They  were  very  interested  in 
our  PC,"  he  says.  "They  felt  the  Dual 
SX/16  would  be  a  perfect  tool  to  train 
people  on  their  de  facto  standard,  as 
well  as  offering  access  to  the  worid 
standard."  AST  should  continue  to 
find  market  potential  for  the  Dual  as  a 
training  tool  as  well  as  a  productivity 
tool.  Ashbrook  believes  that  Japanese 
businesspeople  age  30  and  older  are 
less  computer  literate  than  their  Unit- 
ed States  counterparts  and  therefore 


present  a  sizable  opportunity  for  AST, 

Will  Japan  continue  to  offer  large 
opportunities  to  Western  companies 
wilhng  market  computers  there? 

"We  think  it  will,"  Ashbrook 
says.  "If  you  look  at  Japan  on  a  PC 
per  capita  basis,  they  have  less  than 
half  of  what  we  have  in  the  U.S.  But 
what  that  says  is  that  Japan  is  a  tre- 
mendously technologically  advanced 
country,  but  that  there's  still  a  tremen- 
dous opportunity  to  grow  the  PC  busi- 
ness. Certainly  they  want  to  increase 
productivity  in  their  offices." 

AST  believes  that  the  Japanese 
computer  market  can  best  be  ap- 
proached from  the  high  end.  "Ameri- 
can computer  companies  have  the 
ability  to  keep  product  development 
on  the  leading  edge.  There  are  a  great 
number  of  people  in  Japan  who  want 
to  have  leading-edge  products  and 
will,  in  fact,  take  advantage  of  Ameri- 
can products.  There's  a  market  there, 
and  people  are  hungry  to  get  the  kind 
of  capabilities  that  we  have." 

AST,  in  fact,  has  for  some  time 
sold  its  standard  line  in  Japan.  The 
Dual  SX/1 6  is  an  addition  to  its  Japa- 
nese line,  rather  than  the  launch  of  an 
entire  new  Hne. 

"We  sell  a  number  of  computers 
in  Japan,"  Ashbrook  says.  "Typically, 
these  are  high-performance  386s  and 
486s,  using  American  CAD  packages." 

Ashbrook  attributes  the  market 
for  MS-EMDS  computers  and  Ameri- 
can software  to  the  delays  required  in 
translating  software  to  the  NEC  stand- 
ard. "People  want  the  power  and  the 
design  tools,  so  they're  buying  stand- 
ard products  in  order  to  run  CAD 
packages,  development  packages,  and 
databases." 

What  are  the  cultural  differences 
facing  American  computer  companies 
seeking  to  do  business  in  Japan? 

"By  American  standards,  it  takes 
a  long  time  to  finalize  the  details  of  an 
agreement.  There's  an  inertia,  a  time 
barrier  in  trying  to  finalize  agree- 
ments," Ashbrook  says.  "There's  a 
positive  aspect,  though.  Normally, 
once  you  get  an  agreement  put  togeth- 
er, it  stays  together."  a

SHAREPAK 


RICK 


LEINECKER 


Japan  has  for  centuries  fascinated 
us  with  its  beauty,  culture,  and 
ingenuity.  This  month's  Share- 
Pak  lets  you  explore  these  quali- 
ties in  three  great  programs:  a  lan- 
guage and  culture  tutor,  a  Japanese 
puzzle  game,  and  a  Japanese  compres- 
sion program. 

With  the  SharePak,  you  get  value 
in  every  byte.  Wc  screen  hundreds  of 
programs  and  choose  only  the  very 
best.  Since  the  online  services  have  an 
average  hourly  charge  of  about  $  12, 
obtaining  these  programs  yourself 
would  cost  many  times  the  price  of 
the  disk.  And  that's  not  even  consid- 
ering the  time  you'd  have  to  spend 
running  the  programs  and  sorting 
through  them. 

There's  also  a  money-back  guar- 
antee: If  you  buy  one  of  our  SharePak 
disks  and  aren't  satisfied,  just  return  it 
for  a  refund.  You  can  also  call  us  for 
technical  support  if  you  have  trouble 
using  the  programs  on  the  disk. 

Japanese  for  Business  and 
Travel  y/ersion  1.1 

Imagine  a  gentle,  patient,  and  pleasant 
teacher  willing  to  spend  hours  helping 
you  learn.  That's  what  this  tutorial 
software  is  all  about.  Fifteen  lessons 
bring  you  through  a  basic  course  cov- 
ering language,  social  customs,  and 
other  information.  And  the  program 
is  easy  to  use.  There  are  simple  menus 
to  select  the  lessons  and  options,  and 
most  questions  have  multiple-choice 
answers  requiring  only  a  single 
keypress. 

Pronunciation  is  the  very  first 
lesson.  General  rules  are  given  with  a 
short  quiz  afterward.  These  pronunci- 
ation lessons  appear  throughout  the 
course  when  new  word  categories  and 
concepts  are  introduced. 

The  tutor  also  helps  with  usage, 
verb  tenses,  cases,  and  negatives. 

Lessons  throughout  the  program 
illustrate  problems  that  could  lead  to 
social  blunders.  Learning  to  recognize 
and  avoid  these  should  give  you 
greater  assurance  as  you  interact  with 
Japanese  culture. 

Vocabulary  drills  give  you  the 


essence  of  the  language.  In  spite  of 
their  drill  format,  they're  fun.  You  go 
from  English  to  Japanese  and  from 
Japanese  to  English,  and  you  work  on 
your  spelling  as  you  go.  The  step-by- 
step  progression  from  easy  to  hard 
simplifies  learning  and  builds  your 
confidence. 

If  you're  planning  a  trip  to  Japan, 
if  you  have  Japanese  business  con- 
tacts, or  if  you  just  want  to  prepare 
yourself  for  international  competi- 
tion, this  program  is  for  you. 

Jigsaw 

The  Japanese  are  famous  for  their 
puzzles  and  games  of  logic.  This  pro- 
gram follows  that  tradition  and  pre- 
sents a  variety  of  challenges  in  the 


CULTURE, 

LANGUAGE, 

AND  INGENUITY 


form  of  jigsaw-puzzle  variations.  And 
with  the  Japanese  art  that's  included, 
you'll  imagine  yourself  in  an  Oriental 
garden  alongside  other  puzzlemasters. 

This  program  is  easy  to  use.  Sim- 
ple menus  help  you  select  the  game 
type  and  set  your  options.  And  there's 
mouse  support  if  you  have  a  Microsoft- 
compatible  mouse.  Colorful  back- 
grounds and  attractive  screens  make 
this  a  commercial-quality  product 
with  a  value  far  greater  than  the  price 
ofthe  disk  alone. 

Puzzle  variations  will  give  you 
houre  and  hours  of  challenging  stimu- 
lation. You  can  set  the  puzzle-piece 


size  to  one  of  a  dozen  different 
choices.  Of  course,  the  smaller  the 
pieces,  the  more  difficult  the  task. 
You  can  also  race  against  a  timer  and 
try  to  qualify  for  the  high-score  hall  of 
fame.  If  that's  not  enough,  you  can  re- 
load the  same  puzzle  and  have  your 
friends  try  to  beat  your  time. 

Any  ofthe  puzzles  can  be  saved 
and  finished  later. 

For  die-hard  puzzle  fans,  the  fun 
doesn't  end  with  the  four  that  are  in- 
cluded. You  can  load  in  any  GIF, 
PCX,  or  IFF  picture  that's  in  320  X 
2CX)  resolution.  And  the  program  runs 
on  almost  any  video  card.  Support  for 
Hercules,  CGA,  EGA,  MCGA  (VGA), 
and  Tandy  16^olor  is  provided.  Puz- 
zle buffs  and  avid  Jigsaw  players  won't 
be  able  to  turn  their  computer  off 
once  they  have  this  challenging  and 
graphically  impressive  program. 

LArc  Version  3.33 

If  you  send  files  over  the  modem  or 
store  them  on  floppies  for  later  use, 
this  program  will  save  you  time,  mon- 
ey, and  disks.  It's  a  utility  that  com- 
presses disk  files.  So  programs  that 
were  lOOK  will  now  occupy  only 
about  50K  of  disk  space.  Of  course,  all 
files  compress  differently.  Some  may 
sqeeze  down  to  less  than  half  their  for- 
mer size  while  others  may  not  get  that 
small.  Whatever  the  case,  this  pro- 
gram does  a  great  job. 

It's  easy  to  use,  too.  All  you  have 
to  do  is  type  LARC  at  the  DOS 
prompt  and  a  menu  of  options  comes 
up.  Pressing  H  for  help  gives  you  a 
synopsis  of  all  ofthe  commands.  If 
you  want  to  bypass  the  menu,  you  can 
just  enter  the  options  you  want  as 
command  line  arguments. 

Then,  when  you  want  to  transfer 
your  compressed  files  over  the  mo- 
dem, your  connection  time  is  reduced. 
If  the  connection  is  long  distance,  that 
means  you'll  save  money.  When,  on 
top  of  long-distance  expenses,  you're 
paying  an  online  service  for  connect 
time,  you'll  save  even  more.  And  if 
you're  saving  files  to  floppies,  com- 
pression lets  you  cut  your  space  re- 
quirements about  in  half  a

CANON  COMBINES  A 
PC,  TOUCHSCREEN, 
FAX  MACHINE, 
PRINTER,  AND  PHONE 
TO  CREATE  THE  SWISS 
ARMY  KNIFE  OF 
HOME  OFFICE 


DEESCHNEIDERMAN     EQUIPMENT 


There  are  several  essential  ele- 
ments in  the  modern  office, 
whether  that  ofTice  is  in  a  high- 
rise  downtown  building  or  in  an 
extra  room  in  your  home:  a  computer, 
a  printer,  a  fax  machine,  a  copier,  a 
telephone,  and  an  answering  machine. 
Canon  has  managed  to  incorporate  all 
of  these  features  into  a  single  office 
appliance:  the  Navigator. 

The  Navigator's  all-in-one  con- 
struction answers  the  important  need 
for  elbow  room  not  just  on  a  desk,  but 
in  the  entire  office.  Almost  everyone 
would  like  more  work  space  in  the  of- 
fice. Consider  a  building  contractor 
whose  on-site  office  may  be  a  10- foot- 
wide  trailer.  There  always  seems  to  be 
a  need  to  rearrange  objects  to  free  up 
desk  space  or  floor  space.  That  big 
CPU  is  always  going  to  be  in  the  way, 
and  the  fax  machine  may  end  up  shar- 
ing a  storage  closet  with  shovels  and 
buckets. 

These  problems  are  only  a  mem- 
ory with  the  Navigator.  If  you  place 
the  machine  on  a  swing-away  stand 
with  the  keyboard  tucked  away  under 
the  desk  lop,  you  have  an  electronic 
office  at  your  fingertips  without  hav- 
ing a  crowded  desk.  Since  most  of  the 
phone  and  fax  functions  are  activated 
by  touching  icons  on  the  screen,  you 
won't  even  need  the  keyboard  unless 
you're  entering  data.  You  can  even 
disconnect  or  disable  the  keyboard 
and  use  an  onscreen  software  key- 
board. The  thermal  printer  is  built 
into  the  top  of  the  Navigator,  saving 
even  more  space.

As  this  article  went  to  press,  COM-

will  include  a  40-megabyte  hard

new  unit  for  photographs  and 
would  say  only  that  it  would  retail 
at  about  $2,500.  — Ed 


expansion  box  is  available  which  al- 
lows you  to  use  two  full-size  XT  ex- 
pansion cards.  With  a  Ust  price  of 
$2,995,  this  machine  will  save  any 
home  business  money  as  well  as  space. 

The  Navigator  weighs  in  at  39.6 
pounds,  not  exactly  a  portable  com- 
puter. However,  the  two-piece  con- 
stmction  (main  unit  and  keyboard) 
makes  it  fairly  easy  to  take  the  ma- 
chine home  at  night.  So  while  our 
contractor's  workmen  are  hauling  the 
compressor  up  out  of  thieves'  reach 
on  the  crane,  he  could  pick  up  his 
"Swiss  Army"  Navigator  computer 
and  put  it  in  the  car.  Try  doing  that 
with  your  usual  fax,  telephone,  copier, 
and  computer. 

In  its  standard  two-floppy,  640K 
configuration,  the  Navigator  can  nin 
most  popular  productivity  software.  I 
ran  my  favorite  word  processor,  data- 
base manager,  and  spreadsheet  on  it 
without  a  hitch.  A  hard  drive  is  avail- 


able that  will  ' 

speed  access  time  and 
improve  the  computer's  ease  of  use, 
but  the  Navigator  is  a  very  impressive 
tool  even  in  its  basic  configuration. 

The  Navigator  is  bundled  with  a 
number  of  useful  office  utilities.  The 
phone  book  program  can  store  up  to 
300  names  with  telephone  and  fax 
numbers  in  each  data  file.  Entering 
these  numbers  is  a  simple  matter  of 
touching  the  phone  book  icon,  touch- 
ing a  blank  phone  card,  and  then  en- 
tering the  data.  You  can  also  import 
numbers  from  a  dBase  ///-format 
database  file.  Numbers  can  be  brought 
up  to  the  screen  at  any  time,  even  in 
the  middle  of  a  word  processing  job, 
by  picking  up  the  telephone  handset 
or  touching  an  onscreen  switch.  Just 
touch  the  desired  number  and  the 
Navigator  dials  for  you.  Touch  the 
exit  button  and  you're  back  in  your 
document  or  spreadsheet  You  can  >

COMPUTE      35 


#HOIIE  OFFICE 


monitor  the  dialing  procedure  on  the 
Navigator's  speaker  and  pick  up  the 
handset  when  your  party  answers. 
Numbers  not  included  in  the  phone 
book  files  can  be  dialed  by  calling  up 
the  Navigator's  dial  panel  and  touch- 
ing the  numbers  on  the  screen.  Other 
features  include  automatic  redialing 
and  an  on-hold  melody  (so  you  can 
instantly  annoy  your  clients,  I 
suppose). 

The  Navigator  includes  a  lull- 
featured  answering  machine  that  al- 
lows you  to  record  two  different 
outgoing  messages  and  save  them  on 
disk.  You  can  select  one  or  the  other 
at  the  machine  or  from  a  remote 
phone.  Incoming  messages,  which  are 
also  saved  on  disk,  can  be  played  back 
or  deleted  from  a  remote  phone,  or  se- 
lected by  a  touch  of  the  screen.  The 
wake-up  call  function  allows  you  to 
program  the  machine  to  call  another 
number  at  a  preset  time. 

The  Navigator's  G3  fax  is  loaded 
with  handy  features,  too.  Because  the 
fax  is  integrated  with  the  computer, 
you  can  transmit  a  document  without 
printing  it  out  first.  Say,  for  example, 
you  want  to  send  a  copy  of  a  solicita- 
tion letter  you've  been  working  on  to 
your  office  in  another  city.  Simply  tap 
the  Fax  switch  at  the  top  of  the  screen, 
select  Functions,  then  select  WP 
Trans.  Dial  the  recipient's  number 
either  from  the  phone  book  or  on  the 
screen.  Then  tap  the  exit  switch  twice 
to  go  back  to  your  word  processor.  Is- 
sue your  standard  print  command, 
and  your  document  is  sent  to  the  des- 
tination fax.  Not  only  do  you  not 
have  to  print  out  the  document,  you 
also  don't  have  to  run  it  through  the 
fax  machine  multiple  times  if  you're 
sending  it  to  many  different  locations. 

You  can  receive  faxes  directly  to 
disk  and  then  display  them  in  one  of 
two  magnifications  or  print  them  out. 
You  can  also  transmit  and  receive 
faxes  in  the  usual  manner,  reading 
from  or  printing  directly  to  paper. 
And  you  can  use  your  fax  machine  as 
a  copier.  Just  insert  the  sheet  into  the 
feeder,  tap  the  Dial  switch,  and  then 
press  the  Start  switch.  Thermal  paper 
isn't  my  favorite  print  medium,  but 
it's  certainly  serviceable. 

You  can  send  documents  to 
groups  of  fax  numbers  listed  together 
in  your  phone  book  files.  The  delayed 
transmission  feature  lets  you  save  on 
long-distance  charges  by  transmitting 
during  reduced-rate  hours.  You  can 
even  send  or  receive  delayed  confi- 
dential documents  if  the  recipient  also 
has  confidential  communication  capa- 
bilities. The  fax  can  even  be  set  up  for 


polling,  allowing  it  to  automatically 
send  a  document  upon  request  from 
someone  else.  It  can  also  be  instructed 
to  automatically  attach  a  cover  letter. 
Other  features  include  automatic  re- 
dialing, talk  reservation,  and  one- 
touch  speed  dialing.  The  fax  functions 
don't  take  over  the  computer — you 
can  fax  something  at  the  same  time 
you're  working  with  the  computer. 

An  interesting  technological  note 
is  what  I  call  the  Navigator's  "graphi- 
cal batch  file"  function.  By  building 
Program  Controller  Files  (PCFs),  you 
can  run  applications  from  the  Naviga- 
tor's main  menu.  The  PCF  editor  lets 
you  write  batch  files  that  it  stores  in  a 
directory  on  the  applications  disks. 
Then  you  can  place  icons  for  those  ap- 
plications on  the  main  screen.  This 
process  takes  a  little  knowledge  of 
EXJS,  but  it  isn't  too  tricky. 

Other  fiinctions  included  in  the 
Navigator's  integrated  software  pack- 
age are  a  memo  pad,  a  message  board, 
a  digital  clock,  an  alarm  ilinction,  a 


THE  CANON  NAVIGATOR 

IS  AN  ALL-IN-ONE 
HOME  OFFICE  SOLUTION 


file  manager  utility,  and  a  cute  little 
screen  sweeper.  The  memo  pad's  buff- 
er is  limited  to  the  size  of  the  screen, 
so  it's  useful  for  quick  notes  but  not  as 
a  word  processor  replacement. 

The  screen  sweeper  disables  all 
but  one  of  the  screen  switches  and  dis- 
plays a  little  window-washer  who 
moves  around  the  screen  while  you 
wipe  off  the  fingerprints.  When 
you've  finished  cleaning,  you  touch 
the  little  fellow  twice.  He  bows  polite- 
ly, and  the  main  screen  reappears. 

The  manual  is  a  convenient 
handbook  size,  with  clear  and  concise 
instructions  that  progressively  walk 
you  through  aJl  of  the  Navigator's 
functions.  It's  well  illustrated  and 
thoroughly  indexed. 

It  only  took  me  about  ten  min- 
utes to  get  the  machine  up  and  run- 
ning. This  included  making  the 
system  disk.  Learning  time  was  also 
short.  I  had  very  little  trouble  finding 
my  way  around  the  various  features. 
The  icons  are  simple  and  distinct,  and 
the  menus  proceed  in  a  very  logical 
order. 

There  is  some  room  for  improve- 
ment. The  biggest  problem  is  the  lack 
of  a  hard  drive.  Also,  the  8086  proces- 
sor is  outdated — I'd  really  like  to  see 


this  machine  brought  up  to  AT  stan- 
dards. These  obstacles  can  be  over- 
come with  the  addition  of  the  expan- 
sion box,  but  it  would  be  nice  if  they 
were  built  in.  The  expansion  box  is  al- 
most the  size  of  a  standard  AT  case, 
so  adding  it  negates  some  of  the  com- 
pactness of  the  machine. 

The  touch-sensitive  screen  may 
be  a  little  hard  to  adjust  to  for  those 
who  are  at  home  on  a  keyboard,  but  it 
will  make  the  machine  very  appealing 
for  those  who  don 't  like  to  type.  How- 
ever, the  2mm  touch  area  around  the 
icons  may  be  too  small  for  some  larg- 
er fingers.  In  the  manual  it  cautions 
never  to  press  the  screen  with  any  ob- 
ject other  than  a  finger,  but  a  pencil 
eraser  will  probably  do  fine  if  used 
gently.  Tapping  the  screen  is  much 
simpler  than  moving  a  mouse,  and  it 
eliminates  the  need  to  find  space  for 
the  mouse  pad. 

While  the  Navigator  is  easy  to 
use,  you'll  need  to  read  the  manual  to 
understand  some  functions  that  might 
be  less  than  intuitive.  For  example,  I 
had  problems  receiving  faxes  on  disk, 
because  when  any  of  the  expanded 
functions  or  an  application  is  in  oper- 
ation, it  automatically  disables  the 
disk  receive  function.  No  error  mes- 
sage came  up — it  just  didn't  work.  I 
had  to  wade  through  the  advanced 
facsimile  instructions  to  find  this  little 
tidbit. 

Watch  out  for  typos  in  the  man- 
ual, too.  For  example,  there  were 
transposed  letters:  ,DFB  for  .DBF 
when  referring  to  the  database  file  ex- 
tensions. This  might  be  confiising  to 
some  novices.  I  hope  Canon  corrects 
these  problems  in  fiiture  printings  of 
the  manual. 

In  general,  though,  this  is  a  won- 
derful machine  for  any  business  or 
home  office  user  who  likes  to  save 
both  space  and  money.  Why  buy  a 
PC,  a  fax  machine,  a  printer,  a  phone, 
and  an  answering  machine  when  you 
can  get  an  entire  office  in  a  box?

SeiKe  Of  It  All! 


r^  on't  be  puzzled  about  com- 
f    Iputing  for  the  90's...  call  the 
X-A  company  who  speaks  your  lan- 
guage: Northgate.  We're  your 
problem-solving  partners.  We  listen  to 
your  needs,  analyze  options,  then 
recommend  solutions. 

We  use  a  'modular  systems'  approach 
that  allows  us  to  custom  configure 
your  system  to  meet  your  current  and 
future  needs. 

Now,  let's  shatter  a  few  myths... 

Northgate  is  a  true  manufacturer 
of  computing  systems  ...  not  an 


assembler.  Our  R&D  Department 
works  day  in  and  day  out,  developing 
new  technologies  to  keep  Northgate 
on  the  cutting  edge  of  high 
performance  computing. 

We  design  and  manufacture  our 
own  motherboards  in  the  U.S.A.  If 
you  hear  otherwise,  hang  up  ...  you 
desen'e  die  truth! 

A  word  about  price.  Northgate  is 
the  performance/price  leader  in 
systems  for  home  and  office.  No, 
Northgate  computers  aren't  the 
cheapest.  Why.?  Because  we  don't 
take  shortcuts  in  technology'  to  get 
performance  gains  and  hold  prices 
down.  Some  companies  cut  corners 


to  get  speed  improvements.  Shadow 
RAM  is  one  such  technique. 

Shadow  RAM  sets  aside  room  in 
Rj\M  for  temporary  storage  of  system 
and  video  I/O  instructions  normally 
stored  in  system  ROM.  By  running 
these  routines  in  RAM,  instructions 
can  be  executed  at  the  micro- 
processor's fastest  speed. 

However,  this  RAM  is  best  used  for 
extended  memor\'  needs  like  disk 
caching,  RAM  disk,  and  spoolers. 
When  Shadow  RAM  eats  up  this 
space,  you  can  experience  software 
compatibility  and  operating  problems. 
You'll  never  experience  shortcut- 
related  problems  with  a  Northgate 
system.  Call  toll-free  800-548-1993.

caching  technology  to  extend  total  system 
performance.  Each  svstem  has  a  minimum 
of  64K  SRAM  memory  cache,  32K-64K

Caching  Sofhvare!  Northgate  uses  disk 
caching  software  for  enhanced  performance. 
Here's  how  it  Avorks.  During  a  session  the 
software  learns"  to  anticipate  what  data 
youll  need  next  and  brings  it  into  the  cache 
for  quick  retrie\'al, 

Industry's  most  powerful

System  speed  is  not  based  on  the  CPU 
alone.  Hard  drives,  floppy  drives,  video 
cards  and  other  peripherals  all  play  a  part  in 
enhancing  o^'erall  performance.  One  slow 
element  slows  the  whole  system  down. 
Northgate  solves  this  problem  by  using  the 
latest  in  AT  interface  technology  to 
maximize  system  performance.

THE  ANATOMY  OF 
TR!  CACHING 


SRAM  Memory  Cache!  Northgate  uses 
high-speed  64K-256K  static  SRAM  cache  to 
buffer  frequently  requested  data  from  slower 
memory  storage  areas.  RAM  cache  reduces 
the  main  processor's  idle  time  (wait  stage) 
while  data  is  transferred  to  and  from  main 
memory.  Our  external  486  SRAM  cache 
operates  in  true  burst  mode  for 
33Mb/second  execution  of  instructions. 
Boosts  the  hit  rate  for  data  finding  to  99%! 

Hard  Disk  Caching  Controllers!  Disk 
caching  improves  performance  by  relieving 
the  bottie  neck  caused  by  hard  drives. 
When  reading  and  w-riting  to  hard  disk,  the 
information  passes  through  a  RAM  cache 
buffer.  This  buffer  retains  data  after  it  has 
been  sent  to  its  destination.  If  the  same  data 
is  needed  again,  it  is  drawn  from  the  cache

yes,  we're  a  bit  late  to  the  party 
with  SX  systems.  How  come? 
We  just  couldn't  bring  ourselves 
to  market  another  ho-hum  SX. 

So  we  put  our  research  and 
development  team  on  it.  Boy, 
did  they  rise  to  the  challenge!  Now 
you  can  get  an  SX  16  or  20  MHz 
machine  with  the  power  to  run 
Microsoft*  Windows™  and  other  32-bit 
software  at  flashing  cache-enhanced 
speeds.  And,  they  packaged  all  this 
power  and  performance  into  our 


exclusive  space-saving  case— a 
favorite  of  Northgate  customers! 

The  secret  to  SlimLine's 
space-saving  design?  A  fully 
integrated  motherboard  designed  and 
manufactured  by  Northgate!  This 
design  reduces  bus  load  — makes 
the  system  faster  and  more  reliable! 

Motherboard  features  include  a 
built-in  VGA  adapter  (with  512K 
Video  RAM),  parallel  and  two  serial 
ports,  fully  integrated  floppy  disk 


controller  and  IDE  hard  drive 
controller.  Motherboard  integration 
also  makes  it  easier  to  install  modems 
or  add-in  cards. 

Triple  cache  boosts  performance 
to  zero  wait  state!  You  get  a 
built-in  64K  memory  SRAM  cache 
to  accelerate  the  execution  of 
instructions;  hard  drive  caching 
accelerates  I/O  transactions; 
and  disk  caching  software  speeds 
the  movement  of  data  to  and  from 
the  CPU.

WORKPLACE 


DANIEL         JANAL 


Want  to  double  your  income  in 
six  months?  Double  your  rates. 
That  answer  isn't  as  smug 
as  it  seems.  Home-based  busi- 
ness people  who  have  been  wage 
slaves  for  big  companies  can't  believe 
that  they  can  charge  big  bucks — and 
get  them. 

Let's  look  at  how  the  real  world 
sets  rates.  Remember  when  you  were 
a  $40,000-a-year  big  shot  for  a  service 
company?  You  were  paid  $20  an  hour. 

Meanwhile,  your  time  was  billed 
to  the  client  at  $60  an  hour — three 
times  as  much.  That  allowed  the  capi- 
talists who  paid  you  to  split  the 
amount  equally  to  cover  salary,  over- 
head, and  profit. 

Many  companies  that  charge  by 
the  hour  for  such  services  as  legal  ad- 
vice, accounting,  and  public  relations 
have  used  this  rule  of  thirds  for  gener- 
ations to  justify  their  fees,  meet  their 
obligations,  and  laugh  all  the  way  to 
the  bank. 

One  possible  drawback  to  this 
strategy  is  that  your  clients  can't  pay 
those  rates  and  they'll  find  someone 
who  charges  less. 

Don't  fret.  There  are  several 
strategies  that  you  can  employ  to 
boost  your  bucks.  Each  will  work. 
Choose  the  one  that  meets  your  spe- 
cial situation. 

The  first  strategy  is  to  raise  your 
rates.  I  know,  I  know.  We  just  said 
that  many  clients  might  not  be  able  to 
afford  double  rates.  But  we  didn't  say 
they  could  not  afford  higher  rates. 

Many  home-based  business  peo- 
ple are  shy  about  asking  for  money.  In 
fact,  some  are  downright  bashful. 
They  think  that  it's  close  to  criminal 
larceny  to  ask  for  the  kind  of  money 
they  really  deserve  to  make. 

However,  the  guy  working  out  of 
his  house  down  the  road,  doing  the 
same  work  as  you,  might  charge  $25 
an  hour  more  than  you,  and  his  work 
might  not  even  be  as  good.  Why  is  he 
making  more  money? 

Because  he  asked  for  it! 

Find  out  what  the  going  rate  is 
for  services  in  your  area.  If  your  com- 
petitor charges  $  1 00  an  hour  and 


you're  asking  for  only  $50,  then  you 
can  make  a  lot  more  just  by  meeting 
his  rates. 

You  might  say  "That's  stupid.  I 
have  time  on  my  hands.  I  can  attract 
many  smaller  clients  and  make  up  the 
difference  in  volume."  That  kind  of 
thinking  is  flawed,  and  here's  why. 

With  a  limited  number  of  hours 
to  sell,  you  have  to  sell  twice  as  many 


hours  at  $50  to  earn  $  1 00. 

The  person  who  charges  less  is 
perceived  as  less  qualified  than  the 
person  who  charges  more.  Strange, 
but  that's  how  some  people  think.  If 
we're  offered  a  bargain,  we  wonder 
what's  wrong  with  the  product  or  per- 
son. Perception  is  everything,  as  Tom 
Peters  said. 

More  clients  means  more  paper- 
work (read  unbillable  time).  Writing 
invoices.  Collecting  late  debts.  Mar- 
keting for  new  clients.  AH  this  down- 
time costs  you  money  in  the  long 
term. 

You  won't  have  time  for  the  big 
project  when  FatCat,  Inc.,  asks  for 
your  services. 

The  moral:  It  is  better  to  have 
fewer  clients  who  pay  high  rates  than  it 
is  to  have  many  clients  who  pay  less. 

The  second  strategy  is  to  get  big- 
ger, better  clients. 

Small  companies  should  do  busi- 
ness only  with  large  companies.  Why? 


Because  big  ones  have  money  and 
don't  mind  spending  it. 

When  a  company  is  big,  $3,000 
for  a  project  doesn't  seem  like  a  lot  of 
money.  When  a  company  is  small, 
$3,000  is  a  big  sum,  indeed. 

A  corporate  mindset  is  in  play 
here.  When  you  say  to  a  big  company, 
"That  project  will  cost  $2,500,"  it 
says,  "Great.  That's  less  than  we  spent 
on  lunch  to  recruit  our  new  marketing 
director." 

When  you  tell  a  small  company 
the  project  will  cost  $2,500,  it  might 
balk.  If  you  negotiate  and  lower  the 
price,  the  small  company  will  wonder 
how  many  corners  you'll  cut.  You 
can't  win. 

The  third  strategy  is  to  work  effi- 
ciently. Plan  your  income,  expenses, 
and  time. 

Never  do  something  once  if  you 
can't  sell  it  twice  or  use  it  twice.  There 
are  exceptions,  of  course,  but  here  are 
a  few  ideas. 

If  you  create  a  newsletter,  you 
might  be  able  to  use  the  same  basic 
layout  for  another  client  in  another  in- 
dustry or  geographic  location. 

.A.  proposal  or  budget  might  work 
for  several  prospects.  Create  a  boiler- 
plate and  save  time.  Change  only 
what  is  needed. 

Create  boilerplates  for  your  in- 
voices, monthly  reports,  form  letters, 
envelopes,  and  marketing  materials. 

Sell  to  your  existing  customers. 
They're  your  easiest  sales  because 
they  know  that  you  exist,  that  you're 
credible,  and  that  you  charge  a  fair 
price.  Since  existing  customers  might 
not  be  aware  of  all  your  services, 
make  sure  you  discuss  these  benefits 
at  your  next  meeting. 

One  way  to  turn  dead  time  into 
productive  time  is  to  make  a  list  of 
mindless  tasks,  like  formatting  disks, 
filing  correspondence,  and  sorting  file 
folders.  Place  the  memo  near  your 
phone.  Take  care  of  those  tasks  when 
a  telephone  operator  puts  you  on 
hold.  You'll  be  surprised  how  much 
can  be  accomplished. 

If  you  work  smart,  not  hard, 
you'll  increase  your  income.  H

COMPUTER  CENTERS 

A  DIVISION  OF  TANDY  CORPORATION 


continued  from  page  51 

You  can  put  together  a  complete  set  of  home  business 
software  tools  for  a  lot  less.  For  as  little  as  $  100,  you  can 
collect  the  essential  elements  you'll  need  to  start  up  your 
home  business  and  keep  it  running. 

The  Essential  Elements 

All  businesses  spend  their  time  getting,  doing,  and  keeping 
business.  Your  home-based  venture  won't  be  much  differ- 
ent. Every  business  communicates  with  customers,  tracks 
finances,  records  information,  predicts  profits,  fills  out 
forms,  and  schedules  time.  But  your  home  business  must 
do  all  these  things  more  efficiently  than  your  competition. 
As  a  startup,  you  have  to  make  ever>'  contact  count. 

Put  it  in  writing.  No  matter  how  much  time  you  spend 
on  the  phone,  you'll  still  have  to  write  to  your  customers, 
suppliers,  and  creditors.  To  communicate  effectively  on  pa- 
pier, you  need  a  word  processor. 

Watch  your  money.  Put  some  accounting  software  on 
the  job  and  you'll  be  able  to  track  income  and  expenses  to 
the  last  penny. 

Play  with  numbers.  A  spreadsheet  helps  you  calculate 
loans,  figure  out  how  to  squeeze  more  profit  out  of  your  op- 
eration, and  even  predict  success  or  failure. 

Know  your  customers.  You  need  a  database  to  record 
information  about  customers,  orders,  and  inventory. 

Budget  company  time.  Your  time  is  the  company's 
time,  so  you'll  want  time  management  software  to  turn 
your  computer  into  a  scheduling  secretary. 

Do  the  paperwork.  Put  a  form-making  program  on 
your  hard  disk  and  toss  out  those  generic  forms. 

The  $100  Startup  Kit 

If  you  only  have  S 100,  start  out  simply.  The  cornerstone  of 
your  $  100  kit  should  be  Eighl-in-One.  an  integrated  package 
that  combines  many  essential  business  tools  into  one.  Its 
word  processor  is  the  package's  strongest  module.  It's  easy

Simply  Ingenious ^^ 

Stiop  Smart 

The  cost  of  tiiese  three  startup  software  kits  was  based  on  street  price,  not  sug- 
gested retail  price.  I  consulted  a  number  of  mail-order  software  sellers  and  a  ma- 
jor software  superstore  chain  and  averaged  their  quoted  prices. 

Buying  direct  is  your  best  bet,  PC  Connection,  al  (800)  243-8088,  is  one  well- 
known  mail-order  software  supplier.  It  had  ewerything  in  the  $500  and  $1 .000  kits 
in  stock  lltiough  nothing  from  Ihe  $100  kit),  wilti  the  exception  ol  Top  Priority.  PC 
File  5.0,  and  Galaxy.  MicroWarehouse,  at  (BOO)  367-7080,  had  all  of  the  software 
in  the  $100  and  $500  krts  except  Galaxy. 

Wherever  you  shop  for  your  startup  software,  make  sure  you  make  a  list  It 
might  be  tough  staying  within  your  budget  if  you  don't. 


Advertorial 


What  to  Look  for  In  a 

m  Home  PC 


If  you're  in  the  market  for  a  home  computer, 
here  are  some  helpful  guidelines  to  getting  the 
most  out  of  your  investment. 

The  Right  Software 

Look  for  software  that  is  already  set  up  and 
ready  to  use.  After  all,  you  don't  want  to  have  to 
learn  how  to  use  a  database  just  to  catalog  your 
stamp  collection  or  set  up  a  spreadsheet  to  figure 
interest  charges.  Software  should  be  easy  to  use 
and  designed  specifically  for  the  home.  So  you 
can,  for  instance,  keep  an  inventory  of  your  pos- 
sessions for  insurance  purposes.  Or  make  a  de- 
tailed schedule  for  a  vacation  or  business  trip,  with 
a  list  of  things  to  bring  along.  Or  plan  meals- 
selecting  recipes,  then  making  a  grocery  list  based 
on  the  number  of  people  you're  serving. 

And,  of  course,  you'll  want  software  to  help 
you  manage  your  finances.  Like  an  automatic 
checkbook  register  to  do  all  the  math  for  you, 
and  then  itemize  your  expenses  for  easy  budgeting. 
And  a  program  to  manage  your  stock  portfolio. 
And  when  you're  thinking  about  a  new  house  or 
car,  you'll  want  a  loan  scheduler  to  find  out  ex- 
actly what  your  payments  will  be.  Essentially,  you 
need  easy-to-use  software  to  help  you  manage 
your  finances  now,  so  you  can  plan  ahead  for 
your  financial  future. 

Of  course,  your  home  computer  should  be  PC 
compatible,  so  you  can  run  programs  from  the  of- 
fice as  well  as  tens  of  thousands  of  other  personal, 
entertainment  and  home  education  programs. 

Getting  Up  and  Running 

The  right  computer  should  be  so  convenient  that 
you'll  use  it  all  the  time.  And  your  system  should 
be  compact  and  quiet  to  fit  well  into  any  home  en- 
vironment. A  definite  plus  is  a  feature  that  turns 
off  the  screen  when  not  in  use,  keeping  the  com- 
puter both  energy  efficient  and  ready  to  use  with 
the  touch  of  a  key. 

Plus,  you  need  to  consider  the  keyboard.  A  top- 
of-the-line  business  system  keyboard  will  make  for 
easier,  effective  entry  of  information. 

Stretching  Out 

Finally,  you  need  to  be  able  to  expand  whenever 
you're  ready.  Look  for  built-in  digital  audio  and 
joystick  ports  so  you  can  take  advantage  of  a  wide 
range  of  game  and  home  education  software. 

Fortunately,  there  is  a  computer  that  meets  all 
these  requirements:  the  new  Tand)^  1000  RL  home 
computer.  To  learn  more  about  home  computing, 
plan  to  attend  one  of  the  special  Open  Houses  be- 
ing held  every  Friday  at  Radio  Shack.  Call  any 
participating  Radio  Shack  store,  dealer  or  Com- 
puter Center  for  times,  or  to  set  up  your  own  per- 
sonal demonstration.

around,  it's  the  pick  of  many  professionals. 


to  project  costs.  Eight- in-One's  calen- 
dar and  to-do  list  track  appointments 
and  priorities. 

My  Checkbook  can  handle  simple 
accounting  chores.  It's  a  checkbook- 
writing  and  -register  program  that 
you'll  be  using  a  minute  or  two  after 
installation.  You  can  categorize  ex- 
penses, do  some  elementary  budget- 
ing, and  reconcile  the  account.  Its 
biggest  drawback  is  that  it  handles 
only  one  account. 

.A.hhough  you  could  use  Eight-in- 
One's  database,  I  recommend  a  spe- 
cialized program  like  My  Advanced 
MailList  instead.  Don't  underesti- 
mate this  name-and-address  list  pro- 
gram— customer  and  contact  infor- 
mation are  vital  resources. 

To  make  your  PC  easier  to  use, 
install  MenuWorks.  It's  an  inexpen- 
sive program  launcher  and  DOS  sub- 
stitute that  automatically  creates 
menus  for  you.  You  simply  select 
from  a  menu  and  press  a  key  to  start 
up  a  program,  load  a  file,  or  call  a 
DOS  command. 


The  $500  Startup  Kit 

The  linchpin  of  the  $500  kit  is  another 
integrated  package:  Microsofi  H'brks. 
It  costs  more  than  twice  as  much  as 
Eight-in-One,  but  it's  easier  to  use  and 
more  smoothly  integrated.  Its  spread- 
sheet is  its  strongest  feature. 

Though  you  can  get  by  with 
li'orks'  word  processor,  I'd  recom- 
mend you  try  Galaxy  instead.  It  has 
multiple  windows,  mouse  support, 
menus,  and  a  gigantic  thesaurus,  but 
it's  still  easy  to  operate.  Plus,  it's  dis- 
tributed as  shareware,  so  you  can  try  it 
out  before  you  buy  it. 

You  can  afford  more  versatile, 
powerful  software  with  this  kit,  so 
pick  Quicken  for  your  accounting  soft- 
ware. It  writes  checks,  tracks  jobs,  and 
follows  taxable  expenses.  Quicken 
works  from  a  familiar  checkbook  in- 
terface, though  it's  much  more  sophis- 
ticated than  a  simple  checkbook 
program.  Quicken  lets  you  pay  your 
bills  through  CheckFree,  an  electronic 
payment  service. 

You  can  also  afford  to  upgrade

your  database.  PC  File  5.0  is  a  flat-file 
database  that  takes  in  huge  amounts 
of  information  and  returns  it  to  you  in 
several  forms. 

Although  Microsoft  Works  in- 
cludes a  small  calendar,  use  Top  Prior- 
ity instead  to  watch  your  time  and 
schedule.  Top  Priority's  to-do  list 
should  keep  you  on  top  of  the  details. 

Rather  than  pay  for  generic  paper 
forms,  make  your  own  with  Formtooi. 
It  provides  complete  control  over 
every  part  of  form  design. 

PC  Tools  Deluxe  6.0  rounds  out 
this  startup  kit.  Though  you  may  first 
use  it  to  insulate  you  from  DOS,  it  has 
far  more  to  offer  than  Menu  Works. 
PC  Tools  includes  utilities  to  secure 
your  programs,  back  up  your  data, 
and  repair  damaged  files — potential 
lifesavers  for  your  home  business. 

The  $1,000  Startup  Kit 

The  $500  startup  kit  provides  a  solid 
software  foundation,  but  if  you  have 
$  1,000  in  your  budget,  replace  select- 
ed pieces  of  the  $500  kit  with  higher- 
powered  software  thai  can  handle 
your  most  demanding  work.  Then 
spend  the  rest  of  your  money  on 
programs  to  expand  your  business 
capabilities. 

If  your  work  is  word-intensive, 
replace  Galaxy  with  Xy  Write  III  Plus, 
a  favorite  of  many  professional  writ- 
ers. Xy  Write  hiis  everything— superb 
formatting  control,  mail  merge,  multi- 
ple-column priming.  Its  new  menu 
system  makes  it  easy  to  use.  Best  of 
all,  Xy  Write  is  extraordinarily  fast. 

Will  your  home  business  require 
substantial  number-crunching  power? 
If  so,  drop  Microsoft  Wjrfa' spread- 
sheet and  opt  instead  for  Quattro  Pro. 
It's  quick,  it  produces  outstanding 
charts  and  graphs  to  dazzle  your  cli- 
ents, and  it  handles  huge  worksheets. 

If  your  business  depends  on  lists, 
replace  PC  File  5.0  with  Q&A.a  top- 
notch  database/ word  processor  com- 
bination. Q&Ais  much  easier  to 
work  with  than  PC  File.  It  lets  you  re- 
trieve information  by  asking  the  pro- 
gram plain-English  questions,  a  plus 
even  for  experienced  database  users. 

But  don't  replace  all  three  of  your 
power  hitters  unless  you  have  to.  In- 
stead, substitute  for  the  one  you  use 
most;  then  go  hunting  for  some  extras. 

Almost  any  home  business  could 
use  a  desktop  publishing  package.  Ex- 
press Publisher  is  perfect  for  creating 
newsletters  or  flyers.  If  you  expect  to 
telecommunicate,  you'll  want  some- 
thing like  Procom  Plus.  It's  inexpen- 
sive but  has  the  advanced  features 
you'll  need.  If  you  spend  a  lot  of  time 
on  the  phone  making  contacts,  pick 
up  Simply  Ingenious,  a  simple-to- 
use  database.  It's  great  for  storing  con- 
tact names,  telephone  numbers,  and 


the  notes  you  take  during  phone 

conversations. 

It's  Your  Business 

It's  possible  that  none  of  these  soft- 
ware kits  will  fit  your  requirements 
exactly.  Though  each  kit  includes 
enough  software  to  meet  basic  busi- 
ness needs,  there  may  be  some  gaps 
only  you  can  recognize. 

It's  your  business.  That's  why 


you're  working  for  yourself  You  call 
the  shots,  so  make  substitutions  free- 
ly. Just  remember  to  look  carefully  at 
your  business  practices  and  then  buy 
the  software  tools  that  make  those 
practices  perfect.  B

Sa       COMPUTE  NOVEMBER       1990 


Saddle  up  your  war  horse  and  pre- 
pare to  invade  the  province  of 
Gaul.  You're  on  the  path  of  des- 
tiny, the  road  to  ruling  the 
known  world,  the  glory-paved  route  to 
your  place  as  Ceaser.  You're  playing 
Centurion:  Defender  of  Rome. 

Even  if  you  don't  ordinarily  en- 
joy historical  simulations  of  battles 
and  conquests,  you  should  consider 
Centurion.  And  if  you're  already  a  fan 
of  electronic  war  games,  you'll  be 
pleased  to  see  where  the  next  genera- 
tion of  these  simulations  is  headed. 

Centurion  has  many  strengths 
and  no  obvious  weaknesses,  just  like  a 
real  leader.  The  gameplay  is  multi- 
layered,  the  interface  is  excellent,  and 
the  graphics  make  the  most  of  the 
PC's  abilities.  And  the  game  is  easy  to 
learn  at  the  beginning,  even  though  it 
becomes  more  challenging  the  longer 
you  play. 

When  you  begin  the  game,  you're 
a  new  commander  of  a  single  legion. 
You  start  in  Rome,  the  capital  of  Ita- 
lia. The  people  are  rebellious,  their 
courage  fierce,  and  your  legion's  cof- 
fers low.  It's  time  to  take  over  a  prov- 
ince. Another  day,  another  invasion. 

Using  your  mouse,  click  in  a  new 
country  on  the  map.  You  can  only 
move  into  a  province  adjacent  to  the 
one  your  legion  is  in,  so  your  early 
choices  are  slim.  You  can  head  east 
for  Dalmatia,  north  for  Alpes,  or  west 
forNarbonensis.  The  manual  suggests 
a  quick  start  to  Centurion:  Begin  by 
occupying  Alpes,  a  land  of  unremark- 
able wealth  and  ordinary  strength. 
Not  a  daunting  foe,  but  a  good  oppo- 


nent  to  learn  on. 

Now  that  you're  in  Alpes,  you 
must  negotiate  with  the  enemy.  Offer 
them  an  ultimatum,  but  don't  expect 
their  leader  to  accept.  You're  word 
isn't  worth  much  on  foreign  soil,  not 
as  a  fledging  commander  anyway. 
They'll  insist  on  battle. 

Battle  is  fine;  you're  up  for  it.  The 
field  of  combat  shows  up  on  your 
screen,  and  you  need  to  pick  a  forma- 
tion: Balanced  Army,  Wedge,  Strong 
Right,  or  Strong  Left.  With  your  for- 
mation selected,  you  see  your  army 
facing  the  enemy.  After  you've  exam- 
ined the  layout  offerees,  choose  a  tac- 
tic. Each  formation  has  its  own  list  of 
tactics.  Balanced  Army,  for  example, 
is  complemented  by  the  following  op- 
tions; Frontal  Assault,  Scipio's  De- 
fense, Drive  a  Wedge,  Outflank,  and 
Stand  Fast. 

As  soon  as  you've  picked  your 
tactic,  the  fray  begins.  You  can  sit 
back  and  watch,  or  you  can  send  spe- 
cial commands  to  individual  units 
that  are  within  the  general's  sphere  of 
influence.  There  are  two  ways  to  find

out  the  size  of  the  general's  sphere  of 
influence.  You  can  click  on  the  gener- 
al to  see  a  dotted  circle  surrounding 
the  cohorts  he  can  control,  or  you  can 
click  on  a  cohort  to  see  if  he  falls  with- 
in the  circle.  If  a  cohort  is  accessible,  a 
small  dot  appears  in  the  lower  corner 
of  the  unit  icon.  To  issue  new  orders, 
grab  the  dot  by  pointing  at  it  and 
holding  the  mouse  button.  Then 
change  the  unit's  course  by  dragging 
in  the  new  direction. 

When  the  battle  has  ended,  you 
can  plunder  the  holdings  of  the  prov- 
ince. This  adds  to  your  budget  but 
subtracts  from  your  popularity.  You 
can  also  hold  games  and  festivities. 
This  subtracts  from  your  budget  but 
adds  to  the  contentment  of  your  peo- 
ple. Every  action  has  a  negative  effect 
and  a  positive  one.  Balancing  these  in- 
fluences is  sometimes  harder  than 
winning  contests  on  the  battlefield.  To 
end  your  turn,  click  on  the  year  icon 
in  the  corner  of  the  screen.  Everything 
starts  again. 

By  the  end  of  the  first  turn, 
you've  only  seen  a  few  aspects  of  this 
multidimensional  game.  Centurion 


isn't  just  batdes  and  spending  money. 
You  can  use  up  a  whole  year  of  the 
game  just  strengthening  your  legions, 
altering  tax  structures,  and  building 
war  ships. 

These  aspects  of  Centurion  are 
passive;  you  take  these  actions  by  se- 
lecting them  from  menus,  and  ihey 
lake  effect  instantly  and  automatical- 
ly. The  cost  is  deducted  from  your 
budget,  and  the  strength  is  added  to 
your  legions. 

To  take  a  more  active  role, 
choose  the  gladiator  show  at  the  Col- 
osseum or  the  race  at  Circus  Maxi- 
mus.  These  two  phases  of  the  game 
add  to  your  reputation  and  your  pock- 
et if  you  win.  They  also  add  interest 
and  variety  to  the  game. 

The  gladiator  show  is  a  typical 
arcade-style  fight.  You  choose  two 
men,  armor  clad  and  trained  at  vari- 
ous levels.  Use  the  keypad  to  strike  at 
your  opponent,  block  his  blows,  and 
execute  some  fancy  footwork.  At  the 
end,  you  choose  thumbs  up  or  thumbs 
down,  granting  the  loser  his  life  or 
sentencing  him  to  death.  If  the  crowd 
agrees  with  you,  your  people  will  re-

vere  your  name.  Otherwise,  the  strug- 
gle for  popular  support  goes  against 
you. 

The  race  is  another  arcade  se- 
quence, with  some  nice  twists.  After 
choosing  a  chariot,  you  can  indulge  in 
some  skullduggery.  Bribe  a  few  oppo- 
nents, invoke  the  favor  of  the  gods,  or 
hire  a  physician  with  a  magic  potion. 
All  of  these  options  cost  money,  so  be 
careful  not  to  spend  so  much  on 
cheating  that  you  have  nothing  left  to 
bet.  When  the  race  begins,  use  the 
keypad  to  whip  your  horses  for  speed. 
Don't  be  seduced  by  the  swiftness, 
though;  your  chariot  will  break  up  if 
you  take  a  curve  too  quickly. 

Once  you've  earned  enough  mon- 
ey and  power,  you  can  increase  your 
strength  by  raising  new  legions,  up- 
grading your  infantry  to  horse  troops, 
and  building  fleets  of  ships  to  battle 
marauding  invaders. 

Adding  to  the  game's  depth  are 
the  difficulty  levels.  Not  only  can  you 
choose  among  four  levels,  but  you  can 
also  fine-tune  them.  For  example,  you 
might  have  mastered  the  fine  art  of 
land  battle,  but  your  racing  skills  still 
leave  you  fourth  in  a  field  of  four. 
Maybe  you  haven't  even  set  sail  yet. 
You  can  choose  a  higher  difficulty  lev- 
el for  land  battles  and  a  lower  one  for 
chariot  races  and  sea  battles. 

For  all  its  mullilayered  playing 
possibilities,  Centurion's  interface  is 
very  easy  to  learn.  A  mouse  is  the  best 
way  to  control  the  action,  but  you 
can  also  use  cursor  keys  and  special 
commands.  You  move  your  legions 
by  clicking  where  you  want  to  go  and 
choose  your  actions  from  well- 
designed  menus. 

Although  there  are  many  com- 
mands available,  they're  very  easy  to 
find.  The  menus  are  organized  in  a 
pyramid  fashion  so  that  there  are  only 
three  menus  to  look  through  at  the  top 
level.  Each  menu  leads  to  others,  but 
you  don't  end  up  with  too  many 
menus  to  search  through  at  any  level. 

Like  the  menu  structure,  the  con- 
trols in  the  sea  battles,  gladiator 
shows,  and  the  races  are  very  well  or- 
ganized. They  are  laid  out  intuitively, 
so  you'll  have  no  trouble  remember- 
ing them.  A  gladiator's  high  strike,  for 
example,  is  the  upper  left  key  on  the 
keypad.  That's  the  direction  in  which 
you  want  to  move  your  gladiator  any- 
way, so  it  makes  sense. 

The  documentation  describes  all 
of  Centurion's  controls  clearly  and 
concisely.  You  don't  have  to  weed 
through  a  Rise  and  Fall  of  the  Roman 
Empire-lengtii  manual  to  learn  how 
the  game  works.  You  only  need  to 


skim  through  about  40  pages,  most  of 
which  describe  some  of  the  subtleties 
of  the  game.  A  poster-size  map  of  the 
Roman  Empire  helps  you  keep  track 
of  your  provinces,  and  a  command 
summary  card  explains  the  controls. 
As  well-designed  as  the  interface, 
Centurion  s  graphics  are  varied  and 
attractive.  You'll  find  several  different 
styles.  One,  best  exemplified  by  land 
battles,  shows  animated  images  of 
quarter-inch-high  soldiers  marching 
across  the  field  of  war.  Along  with  the 
infantry  soldiers,  these  land  battles 
feature  horses  that  gallop  proudly  and

elephants  that  roll  over  and  die  with 
what  seems  like  a  delayed  thud.  The 
chariot  races  are  represented  in  the 
same  way.  The  best  part  is  when  the 
pre-Christian  paramedics  come  out 
with  a  stretcher  and  scrape  you  off  the 
racetrack. 

Not  all  scenes  aife  animated.  To 
start  the  race,  the  game  shows  a  de- 
tailed setting  replete  with  cheering 
fans  and  gleaming  white  horses. 
Before  the  sea  battle  ensues,  you  see 
your  ships  shining,  their  sails  filled 
with  wind.  In  VGA,  these  scenes  are 
stunning. 

Even  the  menus  are  well  drawn 
and  sharp.  When  you  click  on  a  rebel- 
lious province,  for  example,  you  see  a 
still-life  mob  scene,  angry  faces  and 
clenched  fists.  To  add  to  the  game's 
atmosphere,  each  province  has  its 
own  panorama  that  shows  the  land- 
scape and  cUmate  of  the  area. 

Without  a  sound  card,  the  bleeps 


and  bloops  are  annoying.  But  the 
game  supports  Ad  Lib  and  Roland 
sound  boards.  Centurion  is  so  well 
done  that  it  might  be  a  good  enough 
reason  to  break  down  and  buy  one  of 
these  boards.  If  the  sound  is  as  good 
as  the  rest  of  the  game,  it  will  be  well 
worth  your  money. 

Centurion  is  visually  beautiful, 
intellectually  interesting,  and  just 
plain  fun.  The  challenges  change  and 
increase  in  difficulty.  At  first,  you 
simply  win  a  few  land  battles,  and 
that's  the  measure  of  your  success. 
After  a  while,  though,  the  people  will 
cry  out  for  races  and  gladiator  shows. 
Success  becomes  more  elusive;  it  will 
take  a  mixture  of  individual  strength, 
dexterity,  cunning,  and  judgment  to 
prosper.  When  the  marauding  armies 
invade  your  hard-won  provinces, 
global  strategy  becomes  a  significant 
factor.  And  the  high  seas  call  out  to 
your  fleets  of  galleons. 

Centurion  absorbs  you  into  a  fas- 
cinating past  by  giving  you  the  tools 
to  explore  the  world  300  years  before 
the  beginning  of  this  millenium. 
Many  simulations  aim  for  the  same 
goal  but  miss  it  for  one  reason  or  an- 
other. The  subject  matter  may  be  too 
obscure,  the  controls  too  cryptic,  or 
the  graphics  too  static.  This  game,  on 
the  other  hand,  takes  an  inherently  in- 
teresting period  in  human  history  and 
does  it  justice  by  making  the  subject 
matter  accessible  to  anyone  who 
wants  to  approach  it. 

Because  it's  so  easy  to  approach. 
Centurion  is  a  game  for  everyone.  If 
you  have  children,  play  this  game 
with  them.  It  will  help  them  see  histo- 
ry as  something  alive  with  possibili- 
ties. If  you  enjoy  reading  about 
history,  you'll  enjoy  wandering 
through  it  on  your  PC  just  as  much. 
Centurion  faithfully  recreates  the  at- 
mosphere of  Rome's  heydey  as  well  as 
it  represents  the  mechanics  of  con- 
quest. All  hail!

GAMEPLAY 


ORSON 


SCOTT 


CARD 


Remember  the  board  game  called 
Life?  You  play  by  putting  your 
player-figure  into  a  little  plastic 
car  and  driving  along  the  road, 
randomly  landing  on  squares  that  give 
you  money,  debts,  babies,  and  disas- 
ten.  Your  career  is  generated  by  a 
throw  of  the  dice;  everybody  has  to 
get  married;  and  at  the  end  you  win  by 
having  the  most  cash  value  or  by  stak- 
ing everything  on  a  throw  of  the  dice. 
One  last  gamble. 

I  played  it  as  a  kid,  and  it  was 
fun.  But  the  more  I  repeated  the  game, 
landing  on  the  same  squares,  seeing 
the  biases  and  values  built  into  it,  the 
more  frustrated  I  got.  Why  should  the 
dice  make  all  the  decisions?  Why  is 
my  "life"  in  this  game  wholly  im- 
posed upon  me?  Why  can't  I  take  a 
real  part  in  creating  it? 

The  answer  is  easy:  The  board 
can  only  be  printed  once.  With  a  puz- 
zle game  (Scrabble,  for  instance)  this 
doesn't  pose  a  problem;  the  board 
takes  on  new  meaning  as  the  player 
adds  pieces.  On  a  story-type  board 
game,  however,  the  meaning  is  per- 
manently affixed  to  each  location. 

With  computers,  the  story  game 
has  been  able  to  come  into  its  own. 
One  approach  has  been  filmhke:  Sier- 
ra On-Line,  Lucasfilm  Games,  and 
Cinemaware  have  all  developed 
movielike  approaches  that  attempt  to 
give  the  illusion  of  reality.  With  the 
game  of  Life,  it  would  be  the  equiva- 
lent of  having  a  Httle  car  that  actually 
runs  and  little  people  that  move 
around  and  talk  in  squeaky  voices. 

A  lot  of  fun,  but  it  still  runs  into 
that  same  dilemma:  Coming  up  with 
scenery  for  movielike  games  is  expen- 
sive in  terms  of  disk  space,  and  com- 
panies can't  afford  to  include  scenery 
that  isn't  used.  So,  while  you  have  a 
lot  of  freedom  of  movement  within 
each  setting — the  equivalent  of  hav- 
ing your  little  Life  people  get  out  of 
the  car  and  run  around — the  game 
still  has  to  force  you  to  move  through 
all  the  available  locations,  just  like  the 
spaces  on  the  Life  game  board.  The 
game  authors  know  this  and  labor 
mightily  to  try  to  increase  the  illusion 


of  freedom  by  letting  you  visit  the  lo- 
cations in  varying  orders.  But  the 
boundaries  remain  firm. 

There's  another  approach,  how- 
ever, that  has  already  come  a  long  way 
toward  giving  the  player  greater  con- 
trol of  the  story  of  the  game.  These  are 
games  in  which  players  alter  the  board 
during  the  course  of  the  game.  The 
meaning  of  the  board  changes  with 
the  players'  choices.  Think  of  the  de- 
veloping city  scape  in  SimCity  or  the 
constantly  changing  terrain  in 
Populous. 

In  fact,  these  are  really  puzzle 
games  with  an  intensified  story  ele- 
ment. If  we  think  of  the  movielike 
games  as  biographical,  following  an 
individual  character's  passage  through 


the  world,  then  these  map-oriented 
games  would  be  historical,  following 
the  flow  of  larger  events.  There's  little 
or  no  individual,  personal  jeopardy, 
normally  a  vital  part  of  fictional  story- 
telling. Instead  a  whole  city  or  popula- 
tion is  at  risk. 

In  a  way,  these  games  exactly 
reverse  the  relationship  between  de- 
signer and  player.  Where  the  bio- 
graphical games  let  the  player  control 
a  person  moving  through  a  fixed  land- 
scape, the  historical  games  let  the 


player  control  the  landscape,  while  the 
computer  controls  the  people  who 
move  through  it.  We  gain  freedom  to 
control  the  landscape  at  the  cost  of 
losing  individual  control  over  the 
characters. 

The  division  between  these  two 
types  of  games  is  not  permanent.  The 
biographical  games  will  be  greatly 
benefited  by  improvements  in  com- 
puter processors,  which  are  finally  get- 
ting fast  enough  that  it's  practical  to 
create  new  locations  on  the  fly.  This 
way  locations  can  be  coded,  not  as 
pictures,  but  as  descriptions,  and 
thousands  can  be  stored  in  the  same 
disk  space  now  used  for  dozens.  Most 
locations  wouldn't  even  be  visited  in 
the  course  of  a  game.  In  fact,  it's  con- 
ceivable that  these  locations  could  be 
infinite:  If  the  program  includes  algo- 
rithms for  creating  towns  or  rooms, 
then  if  the  player  moves  in  an  unex- 
pected direction,  a  new  location  can 
be  randomly  created  so  that  no  matter 
where  the  player  goes,  there's  already 
a  place  to  arrive. 

At  the  same  time,  the  historical 
games  are  already  reaching  for  ways  to 
include  individual  characten;  to  have, 
in  effect,  heroes  in  the  overall  sweep 
of  history.  SimCity  treats  the  player  as 
an  invisible  mayor  who  has  to  keep 
his  popularity  ratings  as  hi^  as  possi- 
ble, but  this  is  pretty  primitive  as  an 
individual  game  of  Life.  Populous  gets 
somewhat  closer  by  giving  your  popu- 
lace a  leader  who  can  break  loose  and 
become  a  heroic  benerker,  ravaging 
the  enemy  landscape. 

At  the  moment,  we  don't  yet 
have  computers  that  allow  game  au- 
thors to  do  it  all;  when  we  do,  and 
we're  getting  close,  the  creative  minds 
in  both  camps  will  be  ready  to  seize 
the  opportunity. 

I  personally  enjoy  each  one  of  the 
approaches  to  gaming  that  I've  men- 
tioned here.  They're  all  bearing  fruit. 
Each  of  the  games  I've  mentioned 
takes  a  step  toward  helping  gaming  to 
become  a  strong  storytelling  medium, 
one  with  the  same  delights  and  the 
same  transformative  powers  as  nov- 
els, movies,  and  plays.  a

such  as  the  Phantasie,  Ultima,  Wizardry,  and 
Bard's  Tale  series,  and  more  recent  computer 
adaptions  of  paper-and-dice  RPGs,  such  as  Pool  of 
Radiance  and  Dragons  of  Flame,  have  had  a  tremen- 
dous influence  in  the  computer  gaming  world.  But 
did  you  know  that  fantasy  role-playing  and  computer 
adventures  were  both  around  even  before  the  PC?  <>

Enter  the  Dragon 

In  1 974,  bored  insurance  underwriter 
and  freelance  game  designer,  Gary 
Gygax,  decided  that  full-time  game 
design  would  be  more  interesting  than 
the  insurance  business.  Along  with  his 
friend,  Don  Kaye,  Gygax  opened  a 
game  store  in  a  house  beside  the  Pizza 
Hut  in  Lake  Geneva,  Wisconsin. 
There,  they  sold  all  types  of  games  as 
well  as  their  own  rule  sets  for  simulat- 
ing military  battles  with  lead  minia- 
tures. These  Tactical  Studies  Rules 
(TSR)  covered  all  periods  from  the 
Civil  War  and  American  Revolution 
to  ancient  battles  and  the  Napoleonic 
wars. 

An  early  rule  book  for  miniature 
battles,  called  Chainmail,  described 
the  rules  for  medieval  battles  in  which 
each  figure  represented  one  man.  By 
mixing  medieval  soldiers  from  minia- 
ture sets  of  various  sizes,  eariy  gamers 
introduced  giants  and  dwarves  into 
the  battles.  Tolkien's  Lord  of  the 
Rings  was  very  popular  at  the  time, 
and  gamers  figured  a  little  fantasy 
would  really  spice  up  their  battles. 
Once  giants  and  dwarves  began  show- 
ing up  on  miniature  battlefields,  it 
wasn't  long  before  toy  dragons  began 
appearing  on  the  scene.  Naturally,  if 
one  side  had  a  dragon,  the  other  had 
to  introduce  a  magic  user  who  was  ca- 
pable of  casting  fireballs  back  at  the 
winged  beast. 

One  of  the  first  such  fantasy  cam- 
paigns was  created  by  Dave  Amesson, 
a  player  from  a  Minneapolis/St.  Paul 
miniatures  group.  It  involved  a  castle 
under  siege  by  a  medieval  army.  After 
sending  a  commando  group  to  sneak 
into  the  castle  through  the  sewer  sys- 
tem and  open  the  gates,  the  anny  dis- 
covered a  dragon  waiting  inside. 
Thus,  what  was  originally  a 
combat  game  served  as 
the  basis  for  what  we 


know  today  as  Dungeons  &  Dragons. 

Gygax  modified  Arnesson's  cam- 
paign and  printed  1000  copies  of  the 
Dungeons  &  Dragons  rule  book.  Al- 
though it  took  a  full  year  to  sell  the 
books,  the  game  began  spreading  like 
wildfire  among  college  campuses  and 
even  some  high  schools.  The  second 
1 000  rule  books  sold  in  just  six 
months. 

For  a  tot  of  players,  their  first  ex- 
posure to  D  &  D  was  from  a  photo- 
copy of  the  original  rules.  Unlike  the 
prepackaged  fantasy  modules  that 
have  become  popular  in  the  last  sever- 
al years,  these  first  rule  books  were 
simply  instructions  for  playing  out 
your  own  fantasies.  It  was  largely  up 
to  the  gamers  or  referees  to  create  the 
fantasy  worlds  and  monsters  that 

would  be  encountered  there. 

Of  Dice  and  Men 

Originally,  Dungeons  &  Dragons 

was  based  on  two  six-sided 
dice,  and  the  referees,  or  Dun- 
geon Masters  as  they're  frequently 
called,  rolled  the  dice  to  generate 
character  traits,  resolve  combat,  and 
so  on.  Eventually,  dice  with  more 
than  the  standard  six  sides  were 
used.  According  to  Harold 
Johnson,  director  of  special  projects 
for  TSR,  a  lot  of  the  growth  in  the  dice 
industry  can  be  directly  attributed  to 
the  need  for  specialized  dice  for  fanta- 
sy role-playing.  "When  D  &  D  start- 
ed," says  Johnson,  "the  only 
polyhedral  dice  you  could  get  were 
soft  plastic  dice  from  Hong  Kong. 
There  are  now  a  dozen  companies 
producing  polyhedral  dice  with  up  to 
20  sides."  He  adds  that  someone  has 
even  devised  a  "golf 
ball-like"  100-sided 
die  for  D  &  D  gaming, 
Johnson  attributes 
the  phenomenal  acceptance 


of  fantasy  role-playing  to  two  unusual 
conditions.  First,  because  the  Dun- 
geon Master  is  the  only  one  who  has 
to  know  the  rules,  players  are  free  to 
try  anything.  It's  up  to  the  Dungeon 
Master  to  determine  the  player's 
chances  of  success.  Second,  because 
the  original  rules  were  pretty  sketchy, 
people  were  encouraged  to  create  their 
own  rules  and  ignore  those  they  didn't 
like  or  understand.  The  idea  was  sim- 
ply to  have  fun. 

Automatic  Pilot 

By  1 976,  the  D  &  D  fans  who  also 
spent  a  good  deal  of  their  time  in 
computer  science  labs  began  to  realize 
that  most  of  the  Dungeon  Master's 
chores  could  be  automated.  Comput- 
ers could  create  the  dungeons  and,  in- 
stead of  your  having  to  roll  dice,  you 
could  resolve  combat  with  a  quick  roll 
of  the  computer's  random-number 
generators. 

It  was  also  at  this  time  that 
bleary-eyed  hackers,  working  into  the 
wee  hours  of  the  morning,  were  play- 
ing and  modifying  William  Crowther's 
original  mainframe  Adventure  ^mt. 
Crowther,  an  MIT  graduate  who 
spent  part  of  the  sixties  mapping 
Mammoth  Cave  in  Kentucky  for  the 
National  Park  Service,  wrote  his  text- 
based  game,  Adventure.in  FORTRAN

Over  the  next  few  yeai^,  Don 
Woods  was  modifying  Adventure  into 
Adventure  U.  Woods  had  been  study- 
ing computer  science  at  Stanford  Uni- 
versity, where  he  accessed  the  game 
through  an  early  computer  network 
called  ARPAnet.  Other  spinoffs  in- 
cluded Scott  Adams'  all-text  Adventure- 
land,  which  was  written  for  the  TRS- 
80  Model  I,  and  Gordon  Letwin's 
Microsoft  Adventure,  which  was  re- 
leased on  cassette  tape  for  both  the 
TRS-80  and  Apple  II. 

Crowther's  original  Adventure  is 
also  said  to  have  greatly  influenced 
the  MIT-based  designers  of  Zork,  one 
of  the  first  all-text  adventures  to  be 
available  for  a  number  of  microcom- 
puters. The  only  Dungeons  &  Drag- 
ons player  in  the  Zork  group,  Dave 
Lebling,  also  cites  D  &  D  as  an  influ- 
ence along  with  the  authors  H.  R.  Tol- 
kien and  Jack  Vance. 

Room  with  a  View 

By  the  end  of  the  1970s,  most  com- 
puterized adventures  still  relied  solely 
on  text  to  describe  the  labyrinths  and 
monsters  to  which  fantasy  gamers  had 
become  so  addicted.  However,  several 
designers  began  to  work  on  games  that 
would  let  players  see  what  they  were 
up  against. 

Naturally,  the  first  graphic  ad- 
ventures were  crude  by  today's  stan- 
dards. In  1 980,  Ken  and  Roberta 
Williams  founded  Sierra  On-Line  and 
produced  Mystery  House,  a  fantasy 
adventure  with  low-resolution  black- 
and-white  graphics.  Wizard  and  the

graphics  to  bring  their  story  to  life.  Just  ten  years  later.  Sier- 
ra's 3-D  graphics  adventures,  such  as  Camelot  and  Sorcer-

special  effects,  and  high-fidelity  stereo  music. 

Other  computer  D  &  D  pioneers  include  Richard  Gar- 
riott,  cofounder  of  Origin  Systems  and  creator  of  the  tre- 
mendously popular  Ultima  series  of  role-playing  games. 
Perhaps  better  known  by  the  name  Lord  British,  Garriott 
spent  a  lot  of  time  playing  the  paper  version  of  Dungeons  & 
Dragons  while  in  high  school.  His  fint  attempts  at  creating 
computerized  fantasy  role-playing  games  were  actually 
graded  as  a  school  project.  Today,  Origin  still  gets  high 
marks  for  producing  quality  role-playing  games  that  capture 
the  spirit  of  early  fantasy  gaming. 

Another  fan  of  paper  D  &  D  games  who  went  on  to  cre- 
ate a  successful  computer  fantasy  is  Andrew  Greenberg —

The  Adventure  Continues 

And  what  of  TSR,  the  company  that 
Gary  Gygax  started  beside  the  Pizza 
Hut  in  Lake  Geneva?  TSR  is  still  go- 
ing strong,  producing  rule  books  and 
role-playing  modules  for  Advanced 
Dungeons  &  Dragons  and  other  role- 
playing  series.  In  addition,  the  compa- 
ny publishes  two  magazines  for  RPG 
fans.  Appropriately,  one  is  called  Dun- 
geon and  the  other  is  called  Dragon. 


Some  of TSR's  Advanced  Dun- 
geons &  Dragons  (AD&D)  adventures 
have,  in  the  past  few  years,  been 
adapted  for  a  variety  of  computer  for- 
mats by  Strategic  Simulations  (SSI)  of 
Sunnyvale,  California.  Initially 
known  for  its  hex-based  war  games, 
SSI  had  already  created  several  suc- 
cessful RPGs  before  linking  up  with 
TSR.  Some  of  SSI's  earlier  fantasy 
hits  included  the  Phantasie  and  Ques- 
tron  series,  Wizard's  Crown,  and 
Rings  of  Zi  If  in.  AD&D  titles  available 
through  SSI  include  Pool  of  Radiance, 
Curse  of  ihe  Azure  Bonds,  Dragons  of 
Flame,  War  of  the  Lance,  Champions

In  addition,  SSI's  Dungeon  Mas- 
ter's Assistant,  Volumes  I  and  II,  let 
Dungeon  Masten  use  an  Apple  II, 
Commodore  64,  or  IBM  PC  to  create 
characters,  treasures,  and  encoun- 
ters— taking  much  of  the  work  out  of 
creating  paper  D  &  D  adventures.  Fi- 
nally, the  latest  TSR/SSI  effort  has  re- 
sulted in  Dragon  Strike,  a  dragon- 
combat  simulator  that  lets  you  fly  into 
battle  on  the  back  of  your  very  own 
dragon  mount. 

Today,  there  are  literally  hun- 
dreds of  computer  adventures  and 
RPGs  to  choose  from  with  new  titles 
arriving  every  month.  Many  have 
spectacular  high-resolution  graphics 
and  beautiful  original  music.  What's 
more,  fantasy  games  of  the  noncom- 
puter  variety  are  more  popular  than 
ever.  So  whether  your  favorite  Dun- 
geon Master  has  a  heart  of  gold  or  a 
brain  of  silicon,  the  future  holds  plen- 
ty of  dragons  to  slay  and  dungeons  to 
explore. 

TSR's  Harold  Johnson  agrees:  "I 
think  there'll  always  be  a  market  for 
computer  D  &  D.  Because  we're  such 
a  mobile  society,  it's  hard  to  find 
someone  to  play  with.  But  it  won't 
supplant  the  paper  game  because  it's  a 
totally  different  experience.  When  you 
have  a  living,  human  Dungeon  Mas- 
ter, the  game  is  different  every  time 
you  play.  It's  a  unique  experience 
that's  worth  sharing  and  retelling  to 
other  people."  h

SHARE  WITH 
YOUR  TODDLER 
THE  DELIGHTFUL 
EXPERIENCE 
OF  EXPLORING 
McGEE'S  HOUSE 
AND  KATIE'S 
FARM 


If  you  have  two-  to  four-year- 
old  family  members  in  your 
house,  I  don't  need  to  tell 
you  what  inquisitive,  imitative, 
and  curious  people  they  are.  They 
love  to  explore,  to  "help"  mommy 
and  daddy  do  their  work,  and  to  par- 
ticipate in  everything  just  as  if  they 
were  grownups.  The  highest  compli- 
ment you  can  pay  toddlers  is  to  call 
them  "big"  and  let  them  do  things  for 
themselves. 

Two  new  software  packages  for 
toddlers,  McGee  and  Katie's  Farm 
from  Lawrence  Productions,  cater  di- 
rectly to  the  needs  of  youngsters  age 
2-6,  These  delightful  computer  expe- 
riences for  wee  ones  contain  no  writ- 
ten words  whatsoever.  They  put  the 
children  in  complete  charge  of  the  ad- 
venture and  let  them  explore  on  their 
own  as  long  as  they  want  to.  In  short, 
it's  computer  heaven  for  small  fry. 

McGee  is  the  two-year-old  star  of 
both  games.  As  the  game  McGee 


opens,  the  star 
wakes  up  in  his  small 
bed,  gets  up,  and 
faces  into  his  room, 
where  toys  await  his 
attention.  The  anima- 
tion stops  while  the  com- 
puter waits  for  your  child  to 
make  a  choice.  Look  at  the 
screen  shot  of  McGee's  room, 
with  its  four  large  icons  across 
the  bottom  of  the  screen.  One  is  high- 
lighted by  a  thick  white  border  around 
it.  Moving  the  mouse  lo  the  left  or 
right  moves  the  highlight  to  the  next 
icon  in  that  direction.  Click  the  mouse 
button  to  choose  an  action. 

Teaching  your  toddler  to  use  the 
mouse  in  this  way  is  a  snap;  it's  a  nat- 
ural way  for  even  a  two-year-old  to 
run  the  computer.  Mouseless  comput- 
ers can  use  the  program,  too;  the  ar- 
row keys  move  the  highlight  and  the 
Enter  key  or  space  bar  chooses  the  ac- 
tion. The  mouse,  however,  seems  to 
be  easier  for  the  very  young. 


Your  child  clicks  on  an  Icon  at  the  bot- 
tom of  the  screen  to  choose  an  action. 


In  that  first  screen,  the  four  icons 
are  the  bunny-rabbit  hand  puppet,  the 
red  rubber  ball,  the  hobbyhorse,  and 
the  door.  Click  on  the  puppet  and  a 
new  screen  appears  in  which  McGee 
plays  with  the  puppet,  talking  to  it  and 
moving  its  arms.  Choose  the  ball  and 
he  bounces  it  against  the  wall,  accom- 
panied by  appropriate  sound  effects. 
Select  the  hobbyhorse  and  he  climbs 
on  it,  shouts  "Giddyap,"  and  canters 
about  the  room  until  the  horse  finally 
stops  at  his  shouted  "Whoa!" 

Choose  the  door  and  your  ne.xt 
screen  is  the  upstairs  hallway,  where 
McGee  faces  a  choice  of  three  doors — 
one  goes  back  into  his  bedroom — and 
the  stairs. 

McGee  has  the  run  of  the  house. 
It's  early  morning.  Mommy  is  still 
asleep,  and  McGee  can  do  pretty 
much  as  he  pleases.  Think  of  how 
your  toddler  will  love  that  scenario. 

How  do  we  know  Mommy's 
asleep?  Go  into  the  door  at  the  end  of 
the  hallway  and  you'll  see  Mommy 


sound  asleep  with  the  cat  curled  up  at 
the  end  of  her  bed.  Click  on  the  icon 
of  Mommy's  face  and  McGee  walks 
over  to  her  and  says  "Morning, 
Mommy."  A  sleepy  eye  opens  and 
contemplates  her  son  briefly.  "Good 
morning,  McGee,"  she  replies,  and 
goes  back  to  sleep.  Now  McGee 
knows  he's  free  to  do  as  he  pleases.  If 
he's  still  nervous  about  Mommy's 
staying  asleep,  he  can  play  the  music 
box.  After  a  minute,  Mommy's  eye 
opens  again  and  she  asks  him  to  turn 
it  off.  Then  she's  asleep  again.  It  looks 
like  clear  sailing. 

McGee  has  a  lot  of  places  he  can 
go.  There's  the  bathroom,  where  he'll 
take  a  bath  (demurely  behind  the 
shower  curtain)  and  brush  his  teeth. 
Then  there's  the  toilet  icon.  When  you 
dick  on  that  one,  McGee  turns  to  you 
with  a  wry  expression  and  points  out 
into  the  hallway.  Your  point  of  view 
shifts  to  the  hallway,  the  bathroom 
door  closes,  and  soon  you  hear  the  toi- 
let flush.  Then  you're  back  in  the 


NOVEMBER       1990

bathroom  to  make  a  new  choice  from 
the  icon  panel. 

Downstairs  is  the  living  room, 
where  McGee  can  crawl  under  the 
rug,  watch  TV,  or  go  into  the  kitchen. 
In  the  kitchen,  he  can  feed  the  dog. 
make  a  phone  call,  or  go  into  the 
fenced  back  yard,  which  offers  a  dan- 
delion, a  tire  swing,  and  a  knothole  in 
the  fence  to  look  through. 

I  have  mentioned  every  screen 
and  action  in  McGee.  An  adult  will 
take  only  ten  minutes  to  explore  ev- 
erything McGee  can  do.  An  adult  will 
enjoy  the  quick  tour  and  admire  the 
excellent  graphics,  the  sound,  and  the 
cleverness  of  the  ideas  involved.  An 
adult  will  think  McGee  and  Katie  are 
as  cute  as  their  own  toddlers.  An  adult 
will  miss  the  point  entirely. 

Little  tykes  will  see  it  with  entire- 
ly different  eyes.  Remember  how 
often  your  two-year-old  wants  you  to 
read  that  favorite  story?  Remember 
endless  repetitions  of  a  favorite  song 
or  game?  Toddlers  don't  do  ring- 
around-the-rosey  once  or  twice:  they 
do  it  over  and  over  again,  even  if 
nothing  changes. 

And  so  it  is  with  these  preschool- 
er's games.  They  go  with  McGee  all 
over  the  house  and  play  with  the  toys 
and  make  phone  calls  again  and  again, 
delighting  in  the  actions  each  time. 
The  little  ones  also  find  things  you 
missed  when  you  went  through  the 
house  with  all  your  grown-up  wisdom. 
Did  you  think  to  look  out  the  knot- 
hole in  the  fence  more  than  once?  If 
you  had,  you  would  have  seen  an  ap- 
ple fall  out  of  the  tree  across  the  street 
the  first  time.  The  next  time,  you'd 
have  seen  the  neighbor's  dog  mn  by. 

The  kids  love  the  feeling  of  con- 
trol. They  decide  what  to  do  and 
make  McGee  do  their  bidding.  They 
don't  need  adult  help;  they're  in 
charge.  There's  great  excitement  for 
toddlers  who  can  say,  "I  can  do  it  my- 
self!" They  also  like  using  the  com- 
puter, doing  their  "work"  with  it  just 
the  way  Mommy  and  Daddy  do. 

And  they  love  to  share  their  expe- 
rience— as  long  as  they  remain  in 
charge.  Sit  with  your  child  on  your  lap 
to  play  the  game.  You  just  watch,  and 
soon  your  toddler  will  be  telling  you 
all  about  what's  going  on,  making  up  a 
story  to  explain  the  actions.  Educators 
tell  us  this  kind  of  activity  helps  de- 
velop verbalization  and  socialization 
skills.  The  kids  also  enjoy  discussing 
the  choices  they  make,  their  favorite 
actions,  and  the  funniest  parts.  These 
games  provide  a  welcome  opportunity 
for  you  to  have  a  happy  one-on-one 
experience  with  your  child. 


Katie's  Farm  is  the  second  game 
in  the  series.  McGee  visits  his  cousin, 
Katie,  on  a  farm.  Richer  than  the  first 
game,  this  one  has  more  choices  and 
more  speech;  and  almost  all  the  ac- 
tions have  more  than  one  outcome  if 
selected  repeatedly.  Clicking  on  the 
old  tree  even  gives  you  three  different 
animations.  Of  course,  it  takes  up 
more  room  on  your  hard  disk  as  a  re- 
sult (a  total  of  1.04MB,  as  opposed  to

McGee'%  865K),  but  it's  certainly 
wonh  it.  The  graphics  seem  even  bet- 
ter, wiih  more  vibrant  colors  and 
more  detailed  scenes. 

On  the  farm,  the  two  cousins 
have  a  glorious  time  exploring  the 
barn  and  chicken  coop,  fishing  in  the 
lake,  playing  with  the  scarecrow,  pick- 
ing berries  (which  McGee  eats  instead 
of  gathering  into  his  bucket),  riding 
the  horse,  and  more.  There's  so  much 
to  explore  on  a  farm! 

There's  one  drawback  to  these 
games,  at  least  in  the  IBM  format:  the 
sound.  Without  a  sound  board  (the 
games  support  the  Covox  Speech 
Thing,  Sound  Blaster,  and  Tandy 
sound),  some  of  the  sound  effects  are 
less  than  effective — and  that's  being 
generous.  The  speech  and  music  come 
through  quite  acceptably,  but  the  oth- 
er effects  come  out  in  rough  blasts  of 


guttural  electronic  tones,  suggestive  of 
someone  fiinneling  large-grain  gravel 
into  a  tin  bucket. 

The  IBM  insert  to  the  manual 
suggests  you  may  want  to  turn  offthe 
sound  during  the  installation  and  en- 
joy the  games  without  sound.  Don't 
do  it;  kids  love  noise  for  its  own  sake, 
especially  if  it's  noise  they  control 
themselves.  They  don't  care  if  that 
chainsaw  noise  really  should  be  the 
sound  of  McGee  brushing  his  teeth. 

With  the  sound  board,  however, 
the  sound  effects  are  excellent,  adding 
considerably  to  the  enjoyment  of  the 
games.  If  you're  into  games  at  all,  you 
need  a  sound  board  anyway. 

These  games  come  by  their  un- 
derstanding of  kids  and  the  education- 
al process  naturally.  Lawrence 
Productions  started  20  years  ago  with 
filmstrips.  Specializing  in  educational 
media  products,  it  now  makes  interac- 
tive computer  programs  as  well  as 
videotaped  instructional  materials, 
primarily  for  the  elementary  school 
market. 

One  day  the  director,  who  was 
working  with  preschoolers,  came  up 
with  the  idea  of  a  no-words  program 
for  toddlers.  The  artists  loved  the 
idea,  the  educational  theorists  knew  it 
would  work,  and  they  all  developed  a 
new  excitement  about  their  work.  It 
shows  in  the  product.  These  games  are 
not  production-line  "educational" 
products;  they're  art,  made  with  love. 

If  you've  got  a  little  McGee  or 
Katie  enlivening  your  life,  you  can  fi- 
nally share  the  joy  and  wonder  of  your 
home  computer  with  them,  bringing 
them  into  the  family  circle  that  may 
occasionally  gather  'round  the  com- 
puter. Give  them  their  own  adventure 
game,  their  own  exciting  experience 
with  the  computer.  Give  them  McGee 
anA  Katie's  Farm.

After  years  of  hype  and  anticipa- 
tion, CD-ROM  (Compact  Disc- 
Read  Only  Memory)  drives  are 
finally  here.  These  relatives  of 
standard  laser-read  compact  discs  can 
annex  vast  amounts  of  computer 
information  to  your  computer,  turn- 
ing it  into  a  library,  a  concert  hall,  a 
movie  theater,  and  more. 

CD-ROM  is  a  play-only  technol- 
ogy, like  a  book  or  audio  compact  disc, 
and  that  appeals  to  software  publishers 
seeking  durable  and  data-secure  ways 
to  deliver  their  products.  CD-ROMs 
are  inexpensive  to  manufacture  and 
are  getting  cheaper  all  the  time:  It  can 
cost  as  little  as  S2  to  press  a  disc,  far 
less  than  the  equivalent  floppy  disks  or 
paper.  Best  of  all,  they  hold  stupefying 
amounts  of  data — 600  or  more  mega- 
bytes— equal  to  perhaps  a  thousand 
average-sized  books  or  hundreds  of 
Lotus  /-2-i-sized  applications. 

CD-ROMs  offer  you  easy  access 
to  unlimited  information — whole  en- 
cyclopedias, huge  bibliographies,  mas- 
sive picture  collections,  entire 
orchestral  works  with  notation,  even 
full-motion  video — at  a  very  reason- 
able price.  The  CD-ROM  version  of 
The  Ne^v  Grolier  Electronic  Encyclo- 
pedia costs  less  than  the  original  paper 
version  (it  doesn't  have  high-quality 
color  illustrations,  though).  A  single 
shelf  of  CD-ROMs  can  hold  the 
equivalent  of  the  printed  information 
contained  in  a  good  local  library,  ac- 
cessible at  the  speed  of  your  com- 
puter. (While  CD-ROM  drives  are 
still  rather  slow — search  speeds  are 
somewhere  between  those  of  floppy 
drives  and  hard  disks — they're  still 
faster  than  paging  through  a  book.) 

Unfonunately,  current  CD-ROM 
drives  are  expensive  (typically 
$700-5 1 ,000  for  a  stand-alone  unit) 
and  aren't  carried  in  most  computer 
stores.  Computer  makers  are  address- 
ing this  problem  by  building  CD- 
ROM  drives  right  into  the  computer 
itself  Steve  Jobs  kicked  off  the  trend 
two  years  ago  by  including  read/write 
optical  storage  in  every  NeXT  work- 
station. On  the  home  front,  Vcndex 
introduced  last  November  the  first  PC 


sporting  a  built-in  CD-ROM  drive, 
bundled  with  several  discs  to  get  you 
started.  Commodore's  recently  an- 
nounced CDTV  combines  an  Amiga 
500  motherboard  with  CD-ROM 
technology.  The  emphasis  will  be  on 
games  and  multimedia  programming 
with  a  lot  of  color,  sound,  and  anima- 
tion. Sierra  On-Line  plans  to  seed  the 
market  this  Christmas  season  by  bun- 
dling a  CD-ROM  drive  with  some 
CD-based  entertainment  software  for 
about  $700.  The  writing  is  on  the 
wall,  and  soon  you'll  see  CD-ROM 
equipped  machines  from  Tandy  and 


other  major  manufacturers — maybe 
even  IBM  and  Apple.  External  CD- 
ROM  drives  will  become  smaller  and 
cheaper  as  well,  since  it's  not  too  diffi- 
cult in  principle  to  adapt  a  portable 
CD  player  to  CD-ROM  use. 

Beyond  new  hardware,  CD- 
ROMs  really  call  for  new  kinds  of  pro- 
gramming as  well.  It  doesn't  make 
sense  to  publish  a  CD-ROM  with  just 
one  game  on  it  (unless  it's  a  very  com- 
plex game  with  video,  animation,  and 
so  on).  For  the  near  future,  most  soft- 
ware companies  will  stick  to  floppies 
for  distributing  single  programs;  CD- 
ROMs  will  be  the  domain  of  big  refer- 
ence works,  general-purpose  databases 
(such  as  the  National  ZIP  Code  Direc- 
tory), and  multimedia. 


From  the  developers'  viewpoint, 
the  transition  from  floppy  disk  pro- 
gramming to  CD-ROM  programming 
is  like  living  in  a  1-room  apartment  all 
your  life  and  then  suddenly  moving  to 
a  iOO-room  mansion  on  a  1000-acre 
estate.  The  space  is  great,  but  you  may 
have  some  trouble  ftimishing  the 
rooms  and  tending  the  garden. 

As  you  might  expect,  the  quality 
of  the  CD-ROMs  currently  available  is 
uneven.  While  some  CD-ROMs  are 
easy  to  use;  others  have  plainly  been 
thrown  together  without  much  thought 
as  to  how  best  to  organize  and  provide 
access  to  the  information.  Imagine  try- 
ing to  use  a  hbrary  in  which  all  the 
books  are  stacked  randomly  on  the 
shelves  and  the  librarians  have  forgot- 
ten to  provide  a  card  catalog.  Some 
CD-ROM  developers,  especially  for 
PCs,  put  you  in  a  similar  position  by 
neglecting  to  include  adequate  search- 
ing capabilities  and  comprehensive  in- 
dexes on  their  discs.  Unfortunately, 
there's  usually  no  way  to  evaluate  how 
usable  a  CD-ROM  is  until  you've  paid 
for  it;  good,  comparative  reviews  of 
CD-ROMs  are  hard  to  find.  My  obser- 
vation is  that  offerings  from  traditional 
pubhshers  with  years  of  experience  in 
producing  reference  books  and  data- 
bases are  likely  to  be  useful  and  well 
thought  out. 

Among  software  pubhshers, 
Microsoft  is  strongly  committed  to 
CD-ROM  technology;  its  Microsoft 
Office  CD-ROM  includes  four  of  the 
company's  best-selling  programs  plus 
all  the  documentation,  tutorials,  and 
other  goodies  you'll  ever  need,  all  in  a 
format  that's  easy  to  use. 

Right  now,  the  number  of  CD- 
ROM  titles  is  small,  and  many  are  tai- 
lored to  the  specific  needs  of  technical 
researchers.  But  the  more  computers 
there  are  with  CD-ROM  drives,  the 
more  general-purpose  CD-ROM  soft- 
ware will  appear  to  run  on  them.  The 
market  for  CD-ROMs  could  snowball 
as  rapidly  as  did  the  market  for  audio 
CDs  a  couple  of  years  ago.  .And.  just 
as  you  don't  want  to  be  without  your 
CD  player,  you  won't  want  to  be  with- 
out your  CD-ROM.  H

KIDS  UN1 10  REUD 


ARCADE  ACTION 

AND 

READING  FUN. 

NOW  YOU  CAN 

GET  IT  ALL! 


^^^  ing! . . .  Boom! . . .  Smash!  . . .  Zap!  Typical  arcade  game  sounds,  right?  But 
^^T^    don't  bet  there  isn't  some  good  learning  going  on.  Even  if  your  troops  refuse  to 
^^^f    read  the  comics,  they'll  jump  at  the  chance  to  read  when  reading  is  part  of  a 
^^^^     thrilling  computer  game. 

Start  your  search  for  the  right  games  by  considering  game  features  along  with  your 
youngster's  particular  interests  and  abihties.  There's  got  to  be  a  careful  balance  between 
arcade  action  and  reading  level  if  you  want  to  keep  kids  coming  back  for  more.  A  lot  of  typ- 
ing may  prove  frustrating  to  poor  spellers,  while  poorly  motivated  readers  need  challenging 
puzzles  and  social  acceptability. 

To  help  you  pick  the  perfect  program,  I've  taken  several  popular  computer  games  and 
grouped  them  according  to  required  reading  ability.  Weak  readers  will  find  that  the  games 
in  group  1  offer  a  lot  of  arcade  action,  involve  relatively  simple  sentence  structure,  and  re- 
quire no  typing  skills.  Hesitant  readers  will  like  group  2  games  because  they  require  more 
reading  skills,  present  more  difficult  puzzles,  and  still  have  enough  arcade  segments  to  keep 
students  thinking  they're  playing  a  game.  Group  3  games  should  appeal  to  good  but  poorly 
motivated  readers.  They'll  need  their  sophisticated  reading  skills,  but  the  reward  is 
increased  intellectual  challenge  with  enough  adventure  sequences  to  keep  things  jumping.^

Games  for  Weak  Readers 

Readers  who  stumble  over  ihree- 
syilable  words,  tend  to  ignore  punctu- 
ation, and  need  control  over  text 
speed  will  like  the  two  programs  in 
this  group.  Three-syllable  words  are 
used  infrequently,  only  about  once  in 
every  1 5  words.  When  a  game's  top 
reading  level  is  grade  6,  you  can  ex- 
pect sentences  to  be  short  and  simple. 

To  keep  things  really  simple, 
both  use  a  "bump"  interface.  In  order 
to  pick  up  something,  ask  a  question, 
or  even  fight,  you  must  first  bump  the 
animated  character  into  the  object. 
Once  there,  the  computer  will  ask  the 
appropriate  question  for  you.  There 
are  no  choices;  you  just  get  to  do  the 
reading.  Young  or  inexperienced 
gamers  find  this  method  very  reassur- 
ing. Even  if  they  don")  understand  all 
of  the  words  in  the  text,  they  can  still 
play  the  game  and  solve  the  puzzles. 

Hillsfar.  Magically  transformed 
into  a  thief,  a  fighter,  a  cleric,  or  a 
magic  user,  you  follow  the  advice  of 
the  head  of  your  guild,  bone  up  on 
your  archery  skills,  and  practice  fight- 
ing. You'll  need  these  skills  and  more 
to  survi\'e  in  Hillsfar.  Every  3-5  min- 
utes, you'll  have  to  do  some  reading; 
the  rest  of  the  time  you  can  roam  the 
countryside,  explore  mazes,  or  toss 
daggers  at  targets.  Each  of  the  roles 
you  pick  to  play  has  different  puzzles 
to  solve  and  directions  to  follow. 

Super  Solven  Midnight  Rescue. 
Morty  Maxwell  has  threatened  to 
make  the  school  invisible  and  you're 
the  only  hope.  Can  you  read  the  clues 
he's  left  scattered  all  over  the  building 
and  take  enough  pictures  of  his  fiend- 
ish robot  friends  to  prevent  this  disas- 
ter? Originally  created  as  an  educa- 
tional tool,  this  game  has  enough 
arcade  action  to  keep  kids  coming 
back  for  more. 

Games  for  Hesitant  Readers 

Hesitant  readers  have  basic  reading 
skills,  but.  fearing  failure,  they  often 
refuse  to  pick  up  a  book.  The  best 
programs  for  them  have  a  higher  read- 
ing level  (grade  7-8)  and  more  three- 
syllable  words  (about  1  in  10  rather 
than  1  in  15).  Sentences  will  be  more 
complex,  the  puzzles  a  little  harder  to 
solve.  Arcade  sections  will  be  fewer 
and  of  much  less  importance. 

Interactive  graphics  add  an  im- 
portant level  of  complexity  to  the 
games  in  this  group.  To  direct  the  ac- 
tion, you'll  have  to  pick  from  a  sup- 
plied list  of  only  6-12  vocabulary 
words.  To  interact  with  an  object — 
say  to  use  a  beer  stein  to  put  out  a 
fire — you'd  have  to  click  on  the  verb 
use,  click  on  the  object  beersiein,  and 
click  on  noun /(>(?.  The  computer 
would  then  write  the  sentence  for  you 
and  perform  the  action.  Easier  to  use 


Space  excitement  keeps  kids  reading. 


Join  Indy  in  this  computer  adventure. 


than  to  describe,  this  interface  im- 
proves the  realism  and  dramatically 
increases  the  potential  complexity  of 
the  puzzles. 

Maniac  Mansion.  The  inhabit- 
ants of  this  creepy  house  may  look 
nasty,  but  some  of  them  are  actually 
friendly.  Despite  their  penchant  for 
locking  you  up  in  the  basement  (hint: 
check  out  those  loose  bricks),  you  can 
get  killed  only  by  doing  something 
really  stupid.  Older  users  will  find  the 
slightly  warped  sense  of  humor  partic- 
ularly appealing. 

Shadowgate.  If  you  can  survive 
your  encounter  with  the  ghoul  of  a 
ruined  castle  and  are  smart  enough  to 
use  the  tools  provided,  you  might  get 
out  alive. 

Clever  graphics  and  exciting  text 
rather  than  arcade  sequences  make 
this  adventure  game  come  alive.  Text

Good  but  Uninotivated  Readers 

Poorly  motivated  readers  have  the  skills;  what  they  really 
lack  is  practice.  For  them  you'll  need  to  pick  programs  that 
provide  significant  challenge  to  make  them  want  to  keep 
reading.  These  titles  have  reading  levels  up  to  grade  11, 
complex  sentence  structures,  and  sophisticated  puzzles. 
There  aren't  many  arcade  segments,  and  frequent  movielike 
sequences  cover  story  ground  quickly. 

Only  the  Carmen  series  uses  the  bump  technique;  all  of 
the  other  programs  in  this  group  make  the  user  type  in  the 
instructions.  These  type-as-you-go  interfaces  offer  literally 
hundreds  of  possible  vocabulary  words  and  thousands  of 
different  combinations  of  commands.  While  this  incredible 
flexibility  makes  these  games  a  lot  of  fun,  they're  also  po- 
tentially very  frustrating.  Remind  your  youngsters  to  jot 
down  important  words  for  future  use.  This  precaution  will 
come  in  handy  when  they  eventually  run  into  a  dead  end. 

If  Aere  in  the  World  Is  Carmen  Sandiego?  Your  task  is 
to  figure  out  the  identity  of  a  thief  track  the  thief  back  to  a 
hiding  place,  and  make  the  arrest.  The  graphics  in  the 
newest  version  are  super,  the  clues  are  challenging,  and  the 
game  is  fun.  Each  chase  is  short,  so  you  won't  get  too  frus-

IMPORTANT  NOTICE 

FOR 

COMPUTE  DISK  SUBSCRIBERS* 

Due  to  production  changes  instituted  witti  the  October  issue  of 
COMPUTE,  all  companion  disks  are  now  being  mailed  separately 
from  the  magazine.  Although  every  effort  is  being  made  to 
have  both  your  disk  and  magazine  arrive  on  the  same  day,  this 
may  not  occur.  You  will  receive  your  disk  under  separate  cover.

trated  if  you  get  confused.  Where  else 
can  you  find  a  family-oriented  reading 
game  that  is  equally  challenging  for 
kids  and  adults? 

Where  in  Time  Is  Carmen  San- 
diego?  Now  you'll  need  a  Chromo- 
skimmer  to  travel  through  time  and 
space  if  you  hope  to  catch  Carmen's 
gang  of  thieves.  The  New  American 
Desk  Encyclopedia  helps  you  decipher 
the  clues,  but  be  careful:  Not  every- 
thing is  what  it  seems.  References  to 
the  Netherlands  or  the  Dutch,  for  ex- 
ample, are  used  to  refer  to  hiding 
places  located  in  Holland,  a  complex- 
ity that  may  confuse  a  weak  reader  at- 
tracted by  the  clever  graphics  and 
interesting  motif 

Kings  Quest  IV:  The  Perils  of 
Rosella.  In  a  land  of  fairy  tales  and 
fantasy,  you  must  help  Rosella  save 
her  father.  It's  not  the  reading  level 
that  makes  this  game  tough;  it's  the 
thousands  of  possibilities  provided  by 
the  typing  interface  that  make  this  se- 
ries a  challenge.  Don't  foi^et  to  buy

get  violent,  the  people  you  meet  aren't 
as  hesitant.  Watch  your  step  or  you 
might  get  fried,  smashed  or  eaten. 
Here,  as  in  the  King's  Quest  series,  the 
innumerable  possibilities  make  this 
game  a  challenge.  Super  graphics,  an 
exciting  plot,  and  tough  puzzles  will 
keep  icids  going  for  hours. 

Reading  Levels 

Reading  level  is  important  when 


choosing  one  of  these  games,  but  not 
that  important.  If  a  program  really 
grabs  the  interest  of  youngsters,  don't 
discourage  them.  Often  the  struggle  is 
as  much  fun  as  winning  the  game. 
And  if  the  struggle  is  too  much,  you 
can  always  sit  down  and  play  the 
game  with  them. 

If  you  want  to  help  your  children 
do  their  level  best  in  reading,  make  it 
fun.  Make  it  a  game.  s

NOVEMBER       1990

TOM         NETSEL 


ror  some  time  we've  been  think- 
ing about  providing  a  showcase 
for  64  and  1 28  artists,  a  place  to 
display  their  computer  master- 
pieces. Beginning  with  this  month's 
Gazette  Disk,  we'll  be  publishing 
some  of  your  best  submissions  in 
what  we  call  "Gazette  Gallery." 

By  selecting  COMPUTE's  Ga- 
zette Gallery  Viewer  from  the  disk 
menu,  you'll  see  some  of  the  best 
64/128  artwork  available  in  a  slide- 
show  format.  Each  piece  will  be  pre- 
sented just  as  the  artist  created  it  and 
as  it  was  meant  to  be  seen,  on  a  com- 
puter monitor. 

We  pay  $50  for  each  picture  that 
we  select  for  display  in  "Gazette  Gal- 
lery." From  those  selected,  we'll  name 
one  Picture  of  the  Month  and  award  it 
an  additional  $50.  So  if  you  have  orig- 
inal computer  artwork  that  you're 
proud  of,  send  it  in.  We  want  to  see 
your  best  work.  Pictures  may  be  in 
Koala,  Doodle,  or  any  other  popular 
format.  Send  no  more 
than  five  entries  per 
disk  per  month  to  Ga- 
zette Gallery,  COM- 
PUTE Publications,  324 
West  Wendover  Ave- 
nue, Greensboro,  North 
Carolina  27408.  Be  sure 
to  put  your  name,  ad- 
dress, and  daytime  tele- 
phone number  on  your 
disk.  And  enclose  a  self- 
addressed,  stamped  disk 
envelope  if  you  want 
your  artwork  returned. 

For  years  we've 
done  our  best  to  provide 
Gazette  readers  with 
outstanding  type-in  pro- 
grams for  the  64  and 
128.  Whether  they're 
games,  programming 
utilities,  or  productivity 
or  educational  pro- 
grams, we  try  to  publish 
a  variety  of  the  best  pro- 
grams submitted  to  us 
each  month. 

Occasionally  we 
come  across  programs 


GEOFFREY  GOVE 


we  like  but  which  are  just  too  large  to 
offer  as  type-ins.  By  adding  so  many 
outstanding  features,  the  programmer 
has  made  the  program  too  big.  The 
listing  would  run  for  pages  and  pages, 
and  it  would  take  weeks  for  the  aver- 
age reader  to  type  it  in.  In  the  past 
we've  been  forced  to  reject  these  pro- 
grams, but  now  we've  found  a  way 
around  this  problem. 

Each  month  on  the  Gazelle  Disk, 
we're  presenting  these  larger  programs 
and  certain  others  as  bonuses.  We 
started  with  the  October  disk  with  a 
program  caWtd  geoGammon.  This 
computer  version  of  backgammon  for 
GEOS  and  GEOS  128  was  simply  too 
large  for  us  to  offer  as  a  type-in,  but 
we  felt  it  was  an  excellent  program 
that  our  subscribers  would  appreciate. 
The  game,  with  complete  documenta- 
tion, appears  only  on  the  October 
disk.  There's  nothing  to  type  in;  it's 
ready  to  run.  Two  other  programs, 
Muki-Color  Lister  and  64-SheU, 


rounded  out  last  month's  bonus  pack- 
age on  the  Gazette  Disk. 

This  month's  disk  features  two 
bonus  programs.  Bastion  is  a  futuris- 
tic, one-  or  two-player  arcade-style 
shoot-'em-up  in  which  your  spaceship 
tries  to  blast  its  way  through  layers  of 
rotating  shields.  Eye  Catcher  is  a 
scrolling  text  utility  that's  handy  for 
announcing  special  events  and  the 
time  they're  scheduled. 

Speaking  of  utilities,  we've  no- 
ticed a  shortage  of  them  recently. 
Most  of  our  recent  submissions  have 
been  games.  Many  of  these  are  excel- 
lent, but  the  64  and  128  are  more  than 
just  great  game  machines.  So  if  you 
have  a  programming  utility — a  piece 
of  software  that  helps  out  around  the 
house  or  office  or  is  educational  in  na- 
ture— we'd  like  to  look  at  it.  We  espe- 
cially need  programs  for  the  128  that 
take  advantage  of  its  unique  features. 
Now's  a  great  time  to  send  your  best 
original  programs  to  our  submis- 
sions reviewer. 

In  an  effort  to  allot 
more  magazine  pages  to 
type-in  programs,  we 
won't  be  printing  The 
Automatic  Proofreader 
and  MLX  in  every  issue 
of  Gazette  as  we  have 
done  in  the  past.  These 
programs  will  still  be 
.    used,  however,  to  help 
:   readers  enter  the  pro- 
-;   grams  correctly.  Copies 
;   of  these  handy  programs 
can  be  found  in  back  is- 
sues of  the  magazine, 
and  we'll  print  them 
whenever  space  allows. 
If  you  don't  have  access 
to  back  issues  and  you 
need  a  copy,  we'll  be 
giad  to  send  you  a  free 
listing.  Simply  write  to 
Typing  Aids  at  the  ad- 
dress listed  above.  Be 
sure  to  enclose  a  self- 
addressed,  stamped  en- 
velope and  remember  to 
mention  which  program 
listing  you  need.  Q

Boys  of  Summer  II 

MicroLeagTie  Sports  Association  (2201  Drummond  Plaza, 
Newark,  Delaware  197H-6711)  haa  released  Enh&noeii 
MicroLeague  Baseball  IT  ($39.95)  for  the  64/128.  No  minor- 
league  joystick  game,  this  simulation  forces  you  to  think. 
You  win  or  lose  based  on  your  managerial  decisions. 

New  features  Include  enhanced  ballpark  graphics  of 
the  Polo  Grounds,  Yankee,  and  Dodger  stadiums,  pop-up 
screens  for  easy  access  to  midgame  statistics  and  substitu- 
tions, expanded  offensive  and  defensive  options,  pitching 
and  hitting  stats  against  left-  or  right-handed  batters,  steal- 
ing and  base-running  ratings,  field  averages  plus  throwing 
range  and  arm  strength,  fatigue  and  power  factors,  and 
more. 

Enhanced  MicroLeague  Baseball  11  comes  with  a  general 
manager  function,  an  automatic  stat  compiler,  and  26  all- 
time  great  teams.  Look  for  MicroLeague  Sports  to  release  an 
Owner's  disk.  Stadium  disks,  Season  disks,  a  League  Leader 
disk,  and  even  World  Series,  Franchise  History,  and  All-Star 
disks  in  the  future.

Desktop 
Publishing  Power 


Datel  Computers  (3430  East 
Tropicana  Avenue  #65,  Las 
Vegas,  Nevada  89121)  has 
been  named  exclusive  dis- 
tributor for  Handyscanner  64 
and  Pagefox,  two  products  that 
create  a  powerful  desktop 
publishing  system  for  the 
64/128. 

Handyscanner  64  is  the  first 
hand-held  scanner  for  the  64. 
Completely  printer  independent, 
the  unit  will  read  graphics  from 
magazines,  books,  photographs, 
or  original  artwork,  which  will 
then  appear  in  a  digitized  format 
on  the  computer  screen. 

Utilizing  an  elaborate  gray- 
tone  processing  method,  the 
Handyscanner  64  promises  ex- 
cellent results  for  digitized  color 
or  black-and-white  photographs. 
There  are  three  processing  meth- 
ods, and  the  scanner  has  sepa- 
rate control  switches  for  light 
intensity  and  contrast,  which 
help  produce  superior  results 
with  difficult  copies  such  as 
photographs  with  little  contrast. 

Handyscanner  64  operates 
independently  of  the  computer 
and  requires  only  the  included 
interface  for  use  with  a  64  or 
128  and  any  other  paint  or 
graphics  program.  The  software 
interfaces  with  the  Pagefox  desk- 
top publishing  program  module. 


The  unit  sells  for  $299.95. 

The  second  item  distributed 
by  Datel  is  Pagefox,  a  desktop 
publishing  program  with  a 
lOOK-memory  storage-expansion 
module.  The  program  operates 
via  menus,  mouse,  or  joystick  to 
define  text,  place  pictures,  and 
control  the  total  graphic  editor. 
Text  can  be  placed  in  any  area 
and  expanded  or  contracted  to 
eliminate  the  need  to  format 
lines. 

Ready-to-use  layouts  for 
one,  two,  or  three  columns  are 
included,  and  text  overflows 
automatically  into  the  next  col- 
umn in  a  user-selected  sequence. 
Text  also  automatically  flows 
around  graphics.  Frames  can  be 
subsequently  moved,  enlarged, 
reduced,  or  eliminated. 

Text  functions  provide  di- 
rect entry  of  headlines,  legends, 
and  so  on  through  the  keyboard 
with  any  of  12  character  sets. 
There  are  eight  variations  of  the 
sets  that  can  be  formatted  in  any 
combination  for  more  than  3000 
script  possibilities  such  as  italics, 
shadows,  outlines,  and  3-D  out- 
lines. .A.dditional  character  sets 
are  reloadable. 

The  Pagefox  module,  with 
its  96K,  plugs  into  the  64  or  128 
expansion  port;  it  costs  $139.95.

BIG  BOYS 


MORTON  A.  KEVELSON 

TAKE  A  HANDS-ON 

LOOK  AT  CMD'S 

NEW  HARD  DRIVES, 

THE  MOST 

EXCITING  BIG 

PRODUCTS  TO  HIT 

THE  COMMODORE 

8-BIT  MARKET  IN 

YEARS 


Creative  Micro  Etesigns  (CMD) 
has  worked  for  years  lo  improve 
the  user  interface  to  Commodore 
floppy  disk  drives  and  to  im- 
prove their  performance.  Now  CMD 
has  taken  the  sum  of  its  Commodore 
disk  drive  knowledge  and  expertise 
and  condensed  it  into  its 
HD  Series  of  hard  drives 
for  the  64  and  128, 

By  doing  so,  CMD 
hopes  to  extend  the  usefiil 
life  of  the  64  and  the  128 
well  into  this  decade.  After 
having  worked  with  a  20- 
megabyte  version  of  the 
CMD  HD  Series  hard 
drive,  I  think  CMD  has  an  excellent 
chance  of  doingjust  that. 

Compatibility  is  the  biggest  hur- 
dle to  overcome  when  designing  a 
mass  storage  device  for  Commodore 
8-bit  computere.  The  1 541,  the  basic 
Commodore  disk  drive,  has  a  unique 
way  of  formatting  and  storing  data  on 
a  floppy  disk.  Since  the  1 54 1  is  con- 
sidered the  bottom  line  for  the  64, 
most  software  developers  have  chosen 
to  adopt  its  format  in  order  to  ensure 
compatibility  with  the  largest  number 
of  machines.  Unfortunately,  the 
1 541*5  1 70-kilobyte  storage  capacity, 
along  with  its  limited  data-transfer 
speed,  is  considered  inadequate  by  to- 
day's standards.  > 


COMPUTE 


e-7 


Interestingly  enough,  it  was  Com- 
modore's introduction  of  the  double- 
capacity  1571  disk  drive  followed  bv 
the  SOO-kilobyte  1581  drive  that  re-' 
laxed  the  compatibility  requirements. 
This  relaxed  compatibility  approach 
was  taken  by  CMD  when  designing 
the  operating  system  for  its  HD  Series 
of  hard  drives. 


A  Standard  Design 

CMD  has  chosen  to  design  its  HD  Se- 
ries around  the  SCSI  standard.  As  a 
result,  although  the  storage  capacity  of 
the  basic  HD  drive  can  be  as  small  as 
20  megabytes,  the  system  can  be  ex- 
panded theoretically  to  a  total  of  four 
gigabytes  (a  gigabyte  is  1.000  mega- 
bytes, or  more  than  a  billion  bytes) 
spread  over  as  many  as  1 3  physical 
hard  drives.  At  the  risk  of  having  to 
eat  my  words  later,  I  will  state  that 
four  gigabytes  is  more  online  capacity 
than  any  64  user  will  ever  need. 

Physically,  the  HD  is  not  much 
larger  than  a  1581.  The  external  di- 
mensions of  its  all-metal  case  are  2.75 
inches  high,  5  inches  wide,  and  10 
inches  deep.  The  system  is  FCC  certi- 
fied to  meet  the  limitations  on  radio 
interference.  Its  external  power  sup- 
ply, about  half  the  volume  of  the  HD, 
is  U/L  certified  and  provides  power  at 
5  volts,  12  volts,  and  —  12  volts. 

The  power  supply  has  its  own  on/ 
off  switch  and  is  fitted  with  six-foot 
long  input  and  output  cables.  The  HD 
also  has  its  own  on/off  switch  on  its 
back  panel.  CMD  recommends  that 
the  drive  be  turned  on  and  off  via  its 
own  power  switch.  The  power  supply 
should  be  left  on  to  extend  the  life  of 
the  back-up  battery  for  the  HD's  built 
in  realtime  clock. 

The  HD's  front  panel  is  a  flat- 
membrane  keyboard  that  sports  eight 
indicator  lights  and  four  push  buttons. 
The  lights  indicate  power  (on),  activi- 
ty (two  lights),  errors,  and  GEOS. 
These  arc  followed  by  push  buttons 
for  SWAP8,  SWAP9,  and  WRITE 
PROTECT,  each  with  an  associated 
indicator  light  and  a  RESET  button. 
In  addition  to  their  designated  func- 
tions, the  lights  flash  through  a  diag- 
nostic pattern  whenever  the  HD  is 
powered  up. 


Up  Front  and  Out  Back 

The  unique  SWAPS  and  SWAP9  but- 
tons enhance  the  HD-20's  compatibil- 


ity with  existing  software.  When  one 
of  these  buttons  has  been  pressed,  the 
HD's  serial  bus  device  number  is 
changed,  however,  to  the  correspond- 
ing value.  If  another  disk  drive  set  to 
either  device  8  or  device  9  is  already 
connected  to  the  serial  bus,  its  device 
number  will  be  exchanged  automati- 
cally with  the  HD-20's.  The  HD-20's 
default  device  number  is  1 2.  This  can 
be  easily  changed  to  any  other  device 
number  ft-om  8  to  30  through  software 
control. 

The  HD's  back-panel  connectors 
include  a  four-pin  power  plug  and  a 
pair  of  standard  six-pin  serial  bus  con- 
nectors. The  official  capacity  of  the 
Commodore  serial  bus  is  four  devices; 
however,  I  was  able  to  run  the  HD-20 
(device  12)  on  a  1 28  with  a  pair  of 
1571  disk  drives  (devices  8  and  9),  a 
1 58 1  disk  drive  (device  1 0),  and  a 
Xetec  Super  Graphix  printer  interface 
(device  4)  without  any  problems. 

The  remaining  back-panel  con- 
nectors are  unique  to  this  drive,  A  six- 
pin  auxiliary  port,  which  is  physically 
identical  to  the  six-pin  serial  bus  con- 
nectors, is  for  future  versions  of  the 
operating  system  that  will  allow  the 
HD  to  intercept  and  store  data  being 
sent  to  device  4  or  5  and  then  spool  it 
out  to  the  printer. 

A  round,  14-pin,  parallel  port 
connector  is  for  the  just-released 
RAMLink  parallel  interface  between 
the  HD  and  the  64/128.  RAMLink 
has  space  for  up  to  four  megabytes  of 
RAM  and  can  be  used  to  boost  data- 
transfer  speeds  between  the  computer 
and  the  hard  disk  drive. 


Daisychain 

Last,  but  not  least,  a  25-pin  SCSI  con- 
nector on  the  back  panel  lets  you  con- 
nect up  to  six  additional  SCSI  devices 
to  the  HD.20.  Since  SCSI  ports  are  in- 
herently bidirectional,  you  can  actually 
use  this  connector  to  access  the  HD- 
20  from  another  computer  equipped 
with  a  SCSI  interface.  Thus,  it's  possi- 
ble to  utilize  the  hard  disk  drive  in  the 
HD-20  with  more  than  one  computer 
system.  In  order  for  this  to  work,  each 
computer  has  to  be  careful  not  to 
trash  the  parts  of  the  hard  drive  that 
are  used  by  the  other  system. 

Inside  the  HD-20,  the  connection 
between  the  system's  electronics  and 
the  20-megabyte  Conner  hard  drive  is 
made  via  a  standard  50-pin  SCSI  con- 
nector and  a  short  flat  ribbon  cable.  If 
you  know  what  you're  doing,  you  can 
daisychain  additional  SCSI  drives  to 
the  system  by  using  the  internal  50- 
pin  connector.  Since  there  is  no  space 


inside  the  HD-20  for  additional  hard 
drives,  you'll  have  to  pass  the  ribbon 
cable  to  the  outside  of  the  case.  You'll 
also  have  to  provide  power  and  an  en- 
closure for  the  external  hard  drive. 

Of  course  this  setup  will  also  vio- 
late the  HD's  six-month  warranty  and 
will  probably  compromise  the  integri- 
ty of  the  system's  radio  frequency 
shielding.  Therefore,  I  do  not  recom- 
mend this  approach  to  the  average 
user,  although  I  suspect  that  there  are 
plenty  of  hackers  who  will  take  advan- 
tage of  the  available  hardware. 


The  Operating  System 

Like  all  other  Commodore  8-bit  disk 
drives,  the  HD  hard  drive  is  an  intelli- 
gent device  with  its  own  DOS  in  16 
kilobytes  of  ROM  and  its  own  6502 
microprocessor  running  at  2  MHz 
with  64  kilobytes  of  RAM.  In  effect, 
the  HD  is  a  stand-alone  microcom- 
puter. The  input/output  hardware 
consists  of  a  pair  of  6522  A  VIA  chips 
and  an  8255  chip.  Most  of  the  HD's 
DOS  is  actually  stored  on  a  small  part 
of  the  hard  drive.  The  operating  sys- 
tem's program  code  is  downloaded 
into  part  of  the  HD's  RAM  when  it's 
powered  up. 

By  placing  a  part  of  the  operating 
system  on  the  hard  disk,  CMD  is  able 
to  upgrade  the  system  by  simply  send- 
ing a  floppy  disk  to  the  end  user.  In- 
stalling the  updated  operating  system 
is  a  very  simple  process  that  takes 
only  a  few  minutes  and  does  not  affect 
any  of  the  data  already  stored  on  your 
drive. 

CMD  has  given  a  lot  of  thought 
toward  maintaining  the  compatibility 
of  the  HD-20's  operating  system  with 
existing  64/1 28  software.  In  general, 
any  software  that  does  not  rely  on 
disk-based  copy  protection  and  uses 
any  of  the  standard  Commodore  DOS 
functions  can  be  transferred  to  and 
run  from  the  CMD  hard  drive.  It's 
safe  to  say  that  any  software  originally 
distributed  on  a  1541  floppy  disk  that 
you've  been  able  to  copy  successfully 
onto  a  1571-  or  1581-format  floppy 
disk  should  run  from  the  HD-20.

The  20-megab>'te  capacity  of  the  hard 
disk  drive  cannot  be  accessed  as  a  sin-

space  into  partitions.  You  can  choose

from  a  variety  of  partition  types,  de- 
pending  on  your  needs.  Native  parti- 
tions can  be  as  small  as  256  blocks  (64 
kilobytes)  or  as  large  as  65,280  blocks 
(about  1 6  megabytes).  They  can  store 
more  than  59,000  files,  any  one  of 
which  can  be  as  large  as  the  entire  par- 
tition. Relative  files  in  a  native  parti- 
tion can  have  as  many  as  65,535 
records.  Native  partitions  also  sup- 
port true  subdirectories  similar  to 
those  used  with  MS/DOS  or  Amiga- 
DOS  systems. 

The  HD  also  supports  partitions 
that  mimic  the  1541,  1571,  and  1581 
disk  drives.  These  partitions  have  all 
of  the  characteristics  of  the  original 
disk  drives,  such  as  storage  capacity 
and  file-size  Hmitations.  The  1 581 
partitions  even  support  158 1 -style 
subdirectories. 

Compatibility  with  the  various 
drives  has  been  maintained  by  sup- 
porting all  Commodore  DOS  func- 
tions, including  the  various  direct  disk 
access  commands  and  the  direct  mem- 
ory access  commands.  For  128  users, 
the  1571  and  1581  burst-command  in- 
struction set  is  supported  with  the  ex- 
ception of  the  MFM  formatting 
commands.  It  would  make  no  sense 
to  support  the  MFM  formatting  com- 
mands because  the  drive  medium  in 
the  HD  is  fixed.  CMD  has  even  gone 
so  far  as  to  emulate  1541,  1571,  and 
1 58 1  job  queue  instructions. 

To  the  64  or  128,  the  HD  looks 
like  a  multiple  floppy  disk  drive  with 
up  to  254  drive  units.  Think  of  the 
HD  as  a  floppy  drive  with  units  num- 
bered between  0  and  254.  You  do  not 
have  to  have  254  partitions,  though; 
just  create  as  many  as  you  want  using 
the  provided  software.  The  current 
partition  is  the  one  that  responds  as 
drive  0  to  the  64/  i  28.  You  can  make 
any  partition  the  current  partition  by 
issuing  an  instruction  over  the  HD's 
command  channel.  You  can  also  set 
any  of  the  partitions  to  be  the  current 
partition  when  the  drive  is  powered 
up.  Thus,  any  software  that  lets  you 
issue  standard  Commodore  DOS 
commands  can  access  any  of  the  HD 
partitions. 

It's  also  possible  to  change  the 
current  partition  via  the  push  buttons 
on  the  HD's  control  panel.  But  the 
procedure  is  cumbersome,  as  it  re- 
quires the  entry  of  the  panilion  num- 
ber as  three  binary  digits  using  (he 
front  panel's  indicator  lights. 


the  one  provided  by  CMD.  You  also 
install  the  CMD  HDTime  program  on 
your  GEOS  boot  disk,  which  lets 
GEOS  automatically  set  its  clock  from 
the  HD's  built-in  realtime  clock. 
GEOS  can  only  access  1581  partitions 
on  the  HD.  Thus,  to  GEOS  the  HD 
looks  like  a  1 58 1  disk  drive  whose 
floppies  are  changed  with  the  CMD 
QuickMove  utility.  QuickMove  also 
lets  you  copy  GEOS  files  between 
1581  partitions  on  the  HD.  It's  also 
possible  to  boot  GEOS  directly  from 
the  HD.  According  to  CMD,  the  Mav- 
erick utility,  available  from  Software 
Support  International,  can  be  used  to 
install  GEOS  onto  a  1581  partition. 
If  you  have  the  May  28,  1987, 
version  of  CP/M  Plus  3.0,  you'll  be 
able  to  access  1541,  1571.  and  1581 
CP/M  partitions  on  the  CMD.  Note 
that  the  1581  CP/M  partition  can  only 
be  accessed  from  CP/M,  as  it  isn't  the 
same  as  a  standard  1 581  partition. 
Earlier  versions  of  CP/M  can  only  ac- 
cess 1541  and  1571  partitions.  As  with 
GEOS,  CP/M  treats  the  HD  as  another 
floppy  disk  drive  whose  disks  can  be 
changed  under  software  control.  The 
SP0RT.COM  utility  is  a  CP/M  pro- 
gram provided  with  the  HD  that  is- 
sues Commodore  DOS  commands 
via  the  serial  port.  SPORT.COM  is 
used  to  swap  partitions  on  the  HD 
under  CP/M. 


GEOS  and  CP/M 

To  use  GEOS  with  the  HD,  replace 
the  GEOS  Configure  program  with 


More  Utilities 

A  set  of  generic  utilities  comes  with 
the  HD  in  addition  to  specific  utilities 
for  GEOS,  CP/M,  and  QuantumLink. 
These  utilities  include  a  versatile  file 
copier;  a  whole  disk  copier  that  can 
duplicate  a  1541. 1571,  or  1581  floppy 
disk  into  the  corresponding  HD  parti- 
tions; and  a  variety  of  partition  and 
HD  system-maintenance  utilities. 
Most  of  these  utilities  come  in  both 
128  and  64  versions.  In  general,  the 
utility  programs  are  easy  to  use  with 
onscreen  menus  and  built-in  prompts. 

Since  the  HD  supports  the  serial 
port's  burst  modes,  it  works  very  well 
with  the  128.  However,  the  64  lacks 
the  burst-mode  hardware,  which  lim- 
its its  data-transfer  speed  over  the  se- 
rial port.  CMD's  JiffyDOS  greatly 
improves  the  performance  of  the  HD 
with  a  64.  JifiyDOS  consists  of  a  re- 
placement ROM  chip  for  the  comput- 
er's operating  system.  To  install  it, 
you'll  have  to  open  your  computer 
and  replace  the  existing  ROM.  You'll 
also  have  to  replace  the  ROM  in  your 
floppy  disk  drive.  On  the  128,  sepa- 
rate ROMs  are  provided  for  the  64 
and  the  128  modes.  Replacing  the 


ROMs  can  be  a  problem  if  the  origi- 
nal chips  in  your  particular  model 
are  soldered  in  or  if  you  aren't  famil- 
iar with  handling  semiconductor 
components. 


Speed 

Serial-port  transfer  speeds  between 
the  HD  and  the  computer  are  the 
same  as  for  a  1541  disk  drive  when 
run  with  a  stock  64.  On  a  128,  transfer 
speeds  were  comparable  to  a  1 58 1 .  In- 
ternal drive  operations,  such  as  for- 
matting a  partition,  generally  take 
only  a  few  seconds.  Loading  a  1 50- 
block  file  from  the  HD,  with  Jiffy- 
DOS, takes  only  5  seconds.  Saving  the 
same  file  to  the  HD,  with  JiffyDOS. 
takes  19  seconds.  Booting  CP/M  from 
an  HD  partition  requires  only  24  sec- 
onds. Copying  a  double-sided  1 57 1 
disk  to  an  HD  partition,  using  the  in- 
cluded MCOPY  whole  disk  copy  pro- 
gram, requires  only  74  seconds. 
Copying  a  1 58 1  disk  to  an  HD  parti- 
tion using  MCOPY  takes  81  seconds. 

CMD  has  done  an  excellent  job 
of  designing  a  SCSI  hard  drive  inter- 
face for  the  64/128  computers.  It  has 
addressed  compatibility  issues  by  pro- 
viding both  hardware  emulation  and 
custom  software.  In  general,  the  limi- 
tations of  the  system  are  due  to  the 
built-in  hmitations  of  the  Commo- 
dore operating  system. 

The  HD  series  of  hard  drives  is 
intended  for  serious  users  of  produc- 
tivity software  who  can  justify  its  cost. 
In  particular,  Creative  Micro  Designs 
has  indicated  that  a  number  of  bulle- 
tin board  programs  will  work  with  the 
HD  hard  drives.  GEOS  users  should 
find  the  HD  an  effective  tool.  Keep  in 
mind,  however,  that  the  HD  operates 
as  a  collection  of  1 58 1  disk  drives  as 
far  as  GEOS  is  concerned.  A  similar 
limitation  applies  to  CP/M  users. 
Also,  be  prepared  to  add  JiffyDOS  to 
your  system  in  order  to  obtain  the 
maximum  possible  performance  from 
the  HD.  Q

QUESTIONS    FROM    OUR    READERS 


Wait  and  See 

r  was  dismayed  yesterday  when  I 
called  the  circulation  department  of 
your  magazine  to  find  out  why  I  had 
not  received  my  July  issue.  I  was  in- 
formed that  Gazette  magazine  was  be- 
ing combined  with  the  parent 
magazine.  The  primary  reason  1  sub- 
scribed to  Gazette  was  that  1  wanted  a 
magazine  dedicated  to  the  Commo- 
dore 8-bil  computers  and  this  was  the 
best  one  on  the  market.  Now  I  fear 
that  if  Commodore  machines  will 
have  to  compete  for  magazine  space 
with  other  computers,  there  will  be 
fewer  articles  and  programs  for  mine. 
1  have  a  128. 1  will  wait  and  sec,  bui  if 
it  is  not  the  quaUty  I  have  enjoyed  and 
grown  accustomed  to,  I  will  sadly  not 
renew  my  subscription. 

TIMOTHY  GROSSER 
COPPERAS  COVE.  TX 

As  a  Gazette  reader  and  subscriber 
since  December  1 984  (still  have  'em 
all),  it  should  make  little  difference  as 
to  your  choices  in  format,  paper,  bind- 
ing, and  so  on.  Gazette  is  Gazette  is 
Gazette.  Whatever  it  takes  to  move 
ahead  into  the  nineties  is  OK.  Con- 
tent, not  format  is  what  is  important 
tome.

Autobooting 

I  was  at  a  friend's  house  (who  has  an 
IBM),  and  when  he  turned  on  his 
computer  all  the  programs  booted 
automatically  with  something  called  a 
CONFIG.SYS  file.  Is  there  something 
for  the  64  that  can  do  this? 

NICK  D-ALONZO 
COATES\ILLE,  RA 

Your  friend's  IBM  probabh'  has  a 
file  called  AUTOEXEC.BAT  in  the 
directory  of  its  default  startup  disk. 
DOS  automativally  executes  what- 
ever commands  are  in  this  file 
whenever  the  computer  is  switched 
on.  This  command  is  often  used  to 
load  and  run  a  commonly  used  pro- 
gram. The  128  has  a  similar  auto- 
boot  feature  for  128  programs,  but 
it's  unavailable  for  the  64  or  for  use 


with  64  programs.  We  did  run  a 
program  for  the  128  called  Fast 
Boot  (May  1987)  that  lets  you  insert 
a  disk  in  the  drive,  turn  on  the  com- 
puter, and  have  a  64  program  ap- 
pear on  the  screen. 


A  Jiffy  Proofreader  Tip 

I  am  a  contented  user  of  a  1 28D  and 
JifiyDOS,  and  I  like  to  type  in  some 
of  the  interesting  programs  you  pub- 
lish in  your  excellent  magazine.  In  or- 
der to  use  The  Automatic  Proofreader 
with  JifiyDOS,  however,  I  find  it  nec- 
essary to  make  two  small  changes  to 
the  program  since  JifiS'DOS  alters  the 
vector  found  at  772  and  the  Proof- 
reader checks  this  vector  twice  to 
identify  which  machine  is  being  used. 
In  lines  30  and  90,  change  IF  VE  == 
17165  to  IF  VE  =  61137.  Earlier  ver- 
sions of  the  Proofreader  have  a  differ- 
ent line  number  but  the  same  PEEK.  I 
hope  this  may  save  one  or  two  readers 
who  have  the  same  setup  a  few  min- 
utes of  head  scratching. 

JOHNSPIRA 
AIJSTINMER,  N.S.W. 
AUSTR_J.LIA 

Thanks  for  the  tip  and  the  kind 
words,  John.  The  JijJ'yDOS  speed 
enhancement  system  from  Creative 
Micro  Designs  does  indeed  alter  the 
vector  you  mentioned  and  could  in- 
terfere with  the  Proofreader.  Those 
of  you  using  J  iffy  DOS  installed  on  a 
64  might  want  to  make  a  similar 
change  in  your  version  of  the  Proof- 
reader. Change  the  value  of  VE  in 
line  20  from  42364  to  60004.  Also. 
check  out  the  rmen'  ofJiffs'DOS  6.0 
elsewhere  in  this  issue. 


Tree  Tracing  Revisted 

In  the  June  "Letters"  column  of  Ga- 
zette, we  asked  readers  to  help  Roy  N. 
KelleyofHamihon.  Ohio,  locate  gene- 
alogy programs  for  his  64/128.  Dozens 
of  people  wrote,  and  here  are  some  of 
their  suggst  ions. 

Byteware,  906  West  6th  Avenue, 


Monmouth,  Illinois  61462,  has  share- 
ware, FGS  and  PED  C,  $2 1 .95,  that 
produces  family  group  sheets  and  ped- 
igree sheets.  I  have  been  using  the 
original  for  two  years,  and  I  like  it 
very  much.  An  improved  version  is 
also  available.

The  following  companies  provide  64

works  well.  I  use  Jermy  II.  the  Geneal-

Powerful  Utilities 

Most  of  the  time  machine  language 
programs  conflict  with  each  other  in 
memory,  but  I  use  three  great  ones  si- 
multaneously. First  I  load  Quick!  (De- 
cember 1988),  relocated  to  block  202. 
Next,  Fund  ion  Ke)>  Magician  (Febru- 
ary 1988)  goes  in,  giving  me  16  tailor- 
made  function  keys.  One  of  these 
loads  my  all-time  favorite  utility,  Tri- 
ple 64  (April  1985).  I  can  now  load 
and  edit  three  separate  25-block 
BASIC  programs  quickly  and  effi- 
ciently. That's  a  lot  of  muscle  for  a 
64!  Thanks  and  keep  encouraging 
authors.

You're  right.  Luis.  Those  utilities  do 
pack  a  lot  of  power.  Gazette  is  al- 
ways looking  for  bandy  utilities  and 
productivity  tools  to  make  the  64 
even  more  useful.  So,  if  you  're  a

It's  5:00  a.m.  It's  dark.  My 
daughter,  Catie,  and  I  have  just 
finished  doing  "her"  paper 
route.  It's  a  Tuesday  morning, 
and  the  routine  never  varies.  Deliver 
the  papers.  Feed  Mowie  the  cat.  Take 
the  trash  out  to  the  curb.  Brew  a  fresh 
pot  of  coffee.  Now,  steaming  cup  of 
coffee  in  hand,  I  trudge  up  the  stairs  to 
my  study,  where  I  spend  many  long 
minutes  staring  with  bleary  eyes  into 
an  empty  computer  screen. 

Suddenly  my  fmgere  start  to  itch. 
I  feel  a  subliminal,  submuscular  trem- 
bling begin  to  wriggle  up  my  nerve  fi- 
bers. In  anticipation,  I  place  my 
fingers  on  the  keyboard.  Miraculously 
the  fingers  begin  tapping,  and  words 
appear  magically  on  the  computer 
screen.  The  cursor  flies  across  the 
screen  hke  a  kite,  sweeping  across  the 
blue  sky,  uncovering  clouds  shaped 
Uke  letters,  words,  entire  sentences. 
I  push  away  fi-om  the  keyboard 
and  gaze  fondly  at  the  screen.  Now 
that's  real  writing,  I  think  admiringly. 
I  grab  my  empty  coffee  cup.  Coffee 
break  time! 

As  I  sit  watching  the  steam  rise 
from  my  fresh  cup  of  coffee,  it  occurs 
to  me  how  strange  it  is  that  we  inter- 
act with  our  computers  by  using  a 
keyboard.  Think  about  it.  Dancing 
fingers.  Ballerina  fingertips  that  tap 
and  skip  across  the  keys.  Is  this  nor- 
mal? Have  we  as  a  species  spent  mil- 
Uons  of  years  evolving  just  for  this 
moment — so  we  could  poke  a  few 
keys  and  communicate  with  a 
computer? 

Isn't  there  a  better  way? 
We  all  know  that  computers  re- 
quire input  through  a  keyboard  be- 
cause that's  the  way  they  evolved. 
Once  upon  a  time  (approximately  40 
years  ago),  they  were  highly  special- 
ized beasts  that  required  communi- 
cation through  special  symbols — 
originally  numerical,  later  alphanu- 
merical.  First  cables  were  used,  later 
switches  on  the  computer's  front  pan- 
el. For  a  while  computer  punch  cards 
were  in  vogue.  Finally  it  occurred  to 
someone  that  perhaps  the  simplest  so- 
lution was  to  just  attach  a  QWERTY, 


typewriterlike  keyboard  to  the  ma- 
chines and  have  at  it. 

But  it's  no  longer  the  1 940s  and 
1950s.  It's  1990,  and  maybe  it's  time 
to  look  beyond  keyboards.  .After  all, 
how  many  regular  human  beings  actu- 
ally feel  cozy  around  a  keyboard 
anyway? 

One  of  the  most  advanced  com- 
puters to  grace  the  movie  screen  in  re- 
cent years  was  Johnny  Five,  the  hero 
of  the  two  Short  Circuit  movies.  John- 
ny loved  input.  But  did  you  ever  see 
him  getting  it  through  a  keyboard? 
Never.  Instead  he  used  his  powerful 
optical  sensors  (his  eyes),  auditory 
sensors  (his  ears),  and  tactile  sensors 
(his  fingers  and  hands)  to  gain  his  pro- 
digious knowledge  of  the  real  world. 


In  addition,  Johnny  looked  dis- 
tinctly uncomputerlike.  Instead  of  sit- 
ting on  someone's  desk  meekly  and 
quietly  waiting  for  the  gentle  tap  of  lit- 
tle keys,  he  was  rolling  around  cities 
and  forests,  combing  the  countryside 
for  more  input.  "Input!  Input!"  he 
cried.  "More  input!" 

Johnny  Five  is  a  good  example  of 
a  computer  that  doesn't  look  like  a 
computer.  There  are  many  more  ex- 
amples in  everyday  life.  Take  your  car 
or  your  wristwatch.  Take  your  tele- 
phone, your  microwave,  your  video 
camera,  your  CD,  or  your  Walkman. 
Or  how  about  fax  machines  and 
phone  mail  at  offices?  All  these  are 
computers.  Some  still  have  keys,  con- 
trol panels,  or  buttons,  but  they  accept 
other  forms  of  input  as  well — images, 


voices,  light  waves,  and  so  on, 

.As  computer  chips  keep  getting 
smaller  and  more  powerful,  the  pres- 
sure will  grow  to  transform  desktop 
computers  into  something  totally 
new.  Already,  incredibly  powerful 
computers  can  fit  in  a  briefcase,  on 
your  lap,  or  even  in  your  pocket.  A 
new  computer  from  Sony  lets  you 
write  on  the  computer  screen  with  a 
plastic  stylus.  A  new  touchscreen  from 
IBM  lets  you  point  at  the  screen  and 
abandon  the  keyboard  entirely! 

If  computers  keep  shrinking,  it 
will  soon  get  impractical  to  try  to  at- 
tach a  full  QWERTY  keyboard.  For 
many  years  experts  have  been  predict- 
ing that  computers  of  the  future  will 
be  built  right  into  our  clothing — our 
eyeglasses,  our  credit  cards,  our  shirts, 
even  our  underwear  and  socks. 

In  his  award-winning  book 
Neuromancer,  William  Gibson  specu- 
lates that  in  the  future  computers  will 
become  so  small  that  they'll  be  able  to 
dangle  from  necklaces,  hang  from  our 
ears  like  earrings,  or  nestle  inside  of 
fillings  in  our  teeth.  Gibson  imagines 
that  human-computer  interfaces  will 
evolve  into  small  "terminals"  im- 
planted in  our  skulls  directly  behind 
our  ears.  We'll  cany  small  cartons  of 
microsofts — intelligent  cosmetic  jew- 
elry that  contains  huge  databases,  new 
skills  libraries  (like  juggling  or  speak- 
ing French),  and  antennae  (cellular 
phones  the  size  of  a  sugar  crystal). 

Whenever  we  need  to  communi- 
cate with  our  computer,  we'll  just  pop 
open  the  case,  pull  out  a  microsoft, 
and  plug  it  into  our  head.  Rich  people 
will  have  real  diamonds,  emeralds, 
and  pearls  aboard  their  microsofts. 
The  rest  of  us  will  settle  for  inexpen- 
sive, synthesized  replicas. 

So,  what  do  you  think?  Write  me 
and  tell  me  your  gut  reaction  to  this 
question:  How  do  you  feel  about  your 
computer  keyboard?  Could  you  give  it 
up  if  something  better  came  along?

faces can  you  imagine?  Send  your

Reach  Out  and  Touch  Everyone 


I 


There  is  an  entire  electronic  world  out  there  at  the  other  end  of  your  phone  line. 
It's  a  world  you  should  find  out  about,  because  it's  going  to  experience  explosive 
growth  in  the  1990's.   It's  tlie  world  of  Electronic  Information. 

Right  now,  there  exist  huge  databases  filled  with  informalionof  every  imaginable 
type.  Electronic  newspapers  publish  accurate  accounts  of  events  only  minutes 
aftertheyVe  occurred!  People  send  and  receive  E-Mail  (electronic  mail)  messages 
to  and  from  each  other,  regardless  of  their  physical  location  on  the  planet!  People 
are  buying  and  selling  things,  paying  bills,  getting  college  educations,  and  even 
working  (called  "Telecommuting")  from  their  own  homes.  And  this  doesn't  even 
scratch  the  surface  of  what's  coming. 

Why  wait  any  longer  to  join  the  Information  Revolution?     Especially  when 
Aprotek  has  just  made  it  so  easy  for  you  to  buy  today!  How?  By  giving  you  easy  to 
use  high-speed  modems  at  breakthrough  prices!    A  modem  is  just  a  device  that 
allows  your  computer  to  talk  to  other  computers  over  ordinary  phone  lines. 
Modems  come  in  different  speeds.   Right  now,  2400  baud  is  the  fastest  speed  that's  practical  for  the  dial-up  phone  system. 

For  the  more  experienced  among  you,  the  Aprotek  Minimodems  are  completely  Hayes  "AT"  command  set  and  are  2400  baud 
"ampersand  command"  compatible,  auto-dial,  auto-answer  devices  that  auto-switch  between  300,  1200,  and  2400  baud  for  maximum 
communications  flexibility  and  service  compatibility.  Minimodems  carry  built-in  sound  capabilities  (internal  speaker  on  Ihe  RS-232  & 
C64/128  versions,  monitor  speaker  on  the  Amiga  version)  and  a  full  array  of  status  indicator  lights. 

If  you're  new  to  telecommunications,  don't  let  the  terms  above  throw  you -it's  just  a  technical  way  of  saying  that  Minimodems  will  give 

you  every  feature  you  could  ever  need  in  modem. 

The  C64/128  Minimodem  plugs  directly  into  the  user  port  on  the  back  of  your  computer.  The  Amiga  version  plugs  right  into  the  serial 
port  and  comes  with  a  built  in  extension  cable  so  you'll  be  able  to  use 
it  with  an  Amiga  500  or  2000  series  and  still  be  able  to  see  the  status 
indicatorlights.  The  Commodore  version  workson  ALL64'sor128's 
ever  made,  while  the  Amiga  version  works  on  the  500  or  the 
2000/2500  series  of  computers.  A  separate  RS-232  and  Amiga  1 000 
version  is  also  available  (please  call  for  details). 

The  most  exciting  aspect  of  the  Minimodems  is  the  remarkable 
prices!  We've  NEVER  been  able  to  offer  this  kind  of  sophisticated 
power  at  prices  so  low  before!  Now  there's  no  good  reason  not  to  get 
involved  in  the  Information  Revolution  today  ~  and  begin  exploring 
the  world  of  tomorrow. 


Built  with  pride  in  the  USA  and  fully  guaranteed  lor  1  year.

reel  like  giving  your  64  a  frontal 
lobotomv?  Tr^  this:  POKE 
l.PEEK(I)  AND  253.  You've 
just  removed  your  computer's 
intelligence.  Hit  RUN/STOP- 
RESTORE  to  return  your  64  to  a 
more  productive  state. 

Experienced  programmers  will 
recognize  the  above  command  as  the 
one  that  switches  out  the  computer's 
ROM  (Read  Only  Memor>')-  Every 
time  your  computer  prints  READY, 
flashes  the  cursor,  or  complains  about 
your  syntax,  it's  because  the  instruc- 
tions located  in  ROM  told  it  to  do  so. 
Without  its  ROM,  your  computer  is 
functionally  brain  dead. 

Two  ROMs.  The  64  has  two 
types  of  ROM:  8K  of  BASIC  ROM, 
which  is  responsible  for  interpreting 
and  executing  BASIC  instructions, 
and  8K  of  Kernal  ROM,  which  han- 
dles the  computer's  more  specialized 
functions,  such  as  reading  characters 
from  the  keyboard  and  moving  the 
cursor.  Together  they  form  the  64' s 
operating  system. 

BASIC  ROM  is  located  at 
40960-49151  ($AOOO-$BFFF),  and 
Kernal  ROM  is  located  at  the  top  of 
the  64's  memory  map  at  57344-65535 
($EOOO-$FFFF).  As  you  might  expect, 
reading  one  of  these  locations  returns 
the  value  that's  stored  in  ROM.  After 
all,  that's  what  the  computer  sees 
here.  However,  when  you  switch  out 
ROM  as  we  did  above.  R.AM  takes  its 
place.  At  this  point,  reading  one  of 
these  locations  returns  the  value  that's 
stored  in  RAM,  Interestingly,  values 
written  to  these  locations  are  always 
stored  in  the  RAM  that  resides  here, 
no  matter  what  the  in-out  status  of  the 
ROM  is. 

The  reason  your  computer  hangs 
when  you  switch  out  ROM  from 
BASIC  is  because  the  underlying 
RAM  doesn't  contain  any  coherent 
machine  language  routines  for  the 
computer  to  execute.  That  is,  not  un- 
less you  put  them  there. 

Customizing  ROM.  Because  the 
underlying  RAM  can  be  written  to  at 
any  time,  it's  easy  to  move  the  con- 
tents of  ROM  to  the  corresponding 


R.AM  addresses.  Once  that's  accom- 
plished, switching  out  ROM  has  no  ill 
effects.  Best  of  all,  you  can  now  modi- 
fy the  ROM  code  to  your  liking,  thus 
changing  the  way  the  computer 
behaves. 

To  copy  ROM  to  RAM  and  then 
switch  out  ROM,  type  in  and  run  the 
following  program.  Be  patient;  this 
takes  more  than  a  minute  to  run. 


10  FOR  1=40960  TO  49151  :POKE 

I,PEEK(I);NEXT 
20  FOR  1=7344  TO  65535:POKE  I, 

PEEK{I):NEXT 
30  POKE  1,PEEK(1)  AND  253 

Line  10  copies  BASIC  ROM,  and 
line  20  copies  Kernal  ROM.  Line  30 
switches  out  ROM  by  clearing  bit  1  of 
memory  location  1  (the  computer's 
R6510  register).  Bit  0  of  this  register 
controls  BASIC  ROM,  while  bit  1 
controls  Kernal  ROM.  You  should 
note  that  we  simply  clear  bit  1  in  line 
30  because  BASIC  ROM  is  automati- 
cally switched  out  whenever  Kernal 
ROM  is.  Only  BASIC  ROM  can  be 
switched  independently. 

READY?  Now  tha't  the  dirty 
work  is  done  and  ROM  has  been 
moved  into  R,AM,  it's  time  to  have 
some  fun.  To  begin  with,  let's  change 
the  READY  prompt.  Enter  POKE 
41849,65:POKE  41850,78  after  run- 
ning the  program  above.  A  familiar 
name  should  appear  in  place  of  the 
computer's  normal  greeting.  If  you 


like,  you  can  add  these  POKEs  to  the 
end  of  the  program  above. 

On  the  more  practical  side,  disk 
drive  owners  can  force  their  comput- 
ers to  default  to  loading  from  and  sav- 
ing to  device  8,  the  disk  drive,  instead 
of  device  1 ,  the  dalasette.  Enter 
POKE  57818,8  and  you  won't  have  to 
type  a  ,8  after  every  load  and  save 
command. 

In  an  old  issue  of  COMPUTE! 
magazine,  Jim  Butterfield  hsts  a 
POKE  that  stops  BASIC  from  shout- 
ing ILLEGAL  QUANTITY  ERROR 
every  time  you  try  to  get  the  ASCII 
value  of  a  null  string.  Enter  POKE 
46991,5  and  the  computer  will  return 
a  value  of  0  when  you  PRINT 
ASC("  "). 

Sheldon  Leemon  mentions 
changing  INPUT'S  prompt  character 
from  a  question  mark  to  a  colon  in  his 
book  Mapping  the  Commodore  64. 
Enter  POKE  53846,58  to  make  this 
change.  Actually,  you  could  POKE 
the  -ASCII  value  of  any  character  here, 
such  as  a  32  for  a  space. 

Enter  POKE  61765,252  and  BA- 
SIC'S GET  statement  wilt  wait  until  it 
receives  a  valid  keypress  before  con- 
tinuing on  (no  more  GET  K$:IF 
K$  =  "  "  THEN. . .  commands). 

Adventuresome  machine  lan- 
guage programmers  might  go  even 
further  and  replace  the  64's  ROM 
code  entirely.  BASIC  could  be  re- 
placed with  a  Pascal  interpreter,  or  the 
whole  computer  could  be  converted 
into  a  dedicated  word  processor  or 
database  system. 

Of  course,  switching  out  ROM 
does  make  your  computer  more  vul- 
nerable to  stray  POKE  commands.  If 
you  accidentally  destroy  a  sensitive 
ROM  location,  your  computer  could 
easily  lock  up.  You  can  switch  back  to 
the  normal  ROM  by  entering  POKE 
1,PEEK(  1 )  OR  3  (assuming  the  com- 
puter is  still  responding  to  your  com- 
mands), hitting  RUN/STOP- 
RESTORE,  or  turning  your  computer

BEGINNER  BASIC 


LARRY         COTTON 


Iast  month,  we  began  a  program 
that  moves  a  musical  sprite  with 
a  joystick.  Let's  continue  from 
the  point  where  we  placed  a  green 
quarter  note  on  a  musical  treble  clef 
staff. 

We'll  be  able  to  play  41  notes, 
from  two  octaves  below  middle  C  to 
the  fourth  A  above  middle  C.  The  64's 
Programmer's  Reference  Guide  pro- 
vides the  frequency  values;  from  them 
we  calculate  POKEable  values.  First 
we  must  dimension  the  arrays. 

200  DIMFU(41),FL{41),C{41) 

FU( )  and  FL( )  are  the  upper-  and 
lower-frequency  arrays  that  will  hold 
the  values  to  be  POKEd  into  voice  I's 
frequency  control  registers.  C( )  is  the 
array  for  the  colors  that  correspond  to 
the  musical  notes. 

Let's  read  the  41  decimal  values 
and  colors  and  calculate  two  POKE- 
able values  for  each. 

210  K=256;FORJ=41TOlSTEP-l: 

READD,C(J):FU(J)= INT(D/K):

57743,6 

Now  we  define  JS,  the  memory 
register  for  joystick  port  2. 

300  JS= 56320 

Lines  310-390  form  an  infinite 
loop;  the  only  way  to  break  out  is  to 
press  the  Run/Stop  key  or  to  turn  off 
the  computer.  First,  PEEK  at  the  joy- 
stick port  to  see  what  value  is  there 
(JD  means  Joystick  Direction). 


310  JD=PEEK(JS) 

We  need  to  check  only  for  certain 
values  that  correspond  to  particular 
directions.  To  detect  if  the  stick  is 
pushed  up,  enter 

320  IFJD=126THENN=N-4:IFN 
<49THENN=49 

The  note  should  move  up  when 
the  stick  is  pressed  up.  N  is  the  verti- 
cal position  of  the  sprite  on  the  screen 
(see  lines  1 10  and  180).  N  must  be  de- 
cremented by  four  pixels  for  the  sprite 
to  move  up  a  note. 

We  hmit  the  value  of  N  to  keep 
the  note  on  the  screen.  In  this  case, 
the  top  Hne's  position  has  the  value 
N=49.  Now  look  to  detect  a  down- 
ward press. 


330  IFJD=125THENN=N-I-4;IFN 
>209THENN=209 

In  this  case  N  is  incremented  by  4  and 
the  bottom  line  of  the  staff  corre- 
sponds to  a  value  of  209  for  N. 

We  haven't  moved  the  sprite  yet; 
we've  only  assigned  it  a  new  vertical 
position.  Let's  look  at  the  port  again 
to  detect  a  press  of  the  fire  button, 
which  will  sound  a  note. 

340  IFJD=111THENGOSUB400 

Press  the  fire  button  and  port  2 


contains  the  value  1 1 1.  We  also  want 
to  detect  if  the  joystick  is  pushed  up  or 
down  with  the  button  pressed.  This 
sounds  notes  as  it  moves,  with  gliding 
arpeggios,  GOSUB400  to  play  the 
note,  assign  a  new  vertical  position  to 
the  sprite,  and  check  vertical  hmits, 

350  IFJD=110THENGOSUB400: 
N = N  -  4;IFN<49THENN = 49 

360  IFJD=109THENGOSUB400: 
N = N  -l-4:IFN>209THENN =209 

Here's  where  we  actually  move 
the  sprite  to  the  new  position  N: 

370  POKEV-I-  1,N:Q= INT(N/4  - 11) 

V+ 1  is  sprite  I 's  vertical  postion.  Q  is 
a  calculated  index  to  the  color  array. 
(Remember  reading  the  color  num- 
bers in  line  210?).  The  colors  cycle 
through  seven  changes,  then  repeat. 
Thus  all  Cs  are  green,  all  Ds  are 
red,  and  so  on.  Now  POKE  the  color 
number  into  sprite  I 's  color  memory 
register. 

380  POKEV-l-39,C(Q) 

End  the  main  loop  by  returning 
to  its  beginning: 

390  GOTO  310 

To  sound  the  note,  POKE  voice 
I's  frequency  registers  with  the  figures 
calculated  in  210: 

400  POKES,FL(Q):P0KES+  1,FU(Q) 

S  and  S-h  1  are  the  firet  two  registers 
of  the  sound  chip;  they  control  voice 
I's  frequency.  We  now  turn  on  the 
note  in  a  rather  strange  way:  by  turn- 
ing it  off  first.  This,  combined  with 
our  envelope  (defined  in  hne  20),  en- 
sures that  our  notes  can  sound  either 
one  at  a  time  or  as  an  arpeggio. 

410  POKES+4,64:POKES-l-4,65 
420  RETURN 

When  you  run  the  program,  try

BUTTERFIELD 


This  month,  we'll  show  how  the 
BIT  command  may  be  used  to 
perform  certain  tests.  Here's  our 
project:  Given  a  6502-based  op- 
code, we  want  to  find  out  how  long 
the  instruction  might  be. 

A  pattern  in  the  opcodes  allows 
us  to  guess  the  length:  If  an  instruc- 
tion (in  hexadecimal)  ends  with  D,  it's 
a  length-3  opcode.  But  some  patterns 
are  not  that  simple.  Opcode  $20  (JSR) 
has  length  3,  code  $30  (BMI)  has 
length  2,  and  code  $40  (RTI)  has 
length  1 .  The  test  will  need  to  be  con- 
structed carefully. 

Standard  disassemblers  use  a 
lookup  table  to  determine  an  instruc- 
tion's length. 

The  code  that  follows  is  more 
compact,  and  it  shows  a  tiew  way  to 
use  the  BIT  instruction. 

Normally,  a  programmer  would 
examine  specific  bits  by  masking 
them  with  .4ND  and  then  performing 
a  comparison.  To  continue  testing, 
the  original  value  would  need  to  be 
loaded  again  so  that  a  new  mask  could 
be  applied.  The  BIT  instruction  has  a 
built-in  AND  test  that  doesn't  disturb 
the  values  being  tested.  It's  more 
efficient. 

The  following  program  runs  on 
all  Commodore  8-bit  computers.  As- 
sume that  the  opcode  to  be  analyzed 
is  in  the  A  register.  It  won't  be  dis- 
turbed during  our  analysis  program;  it 
will  still  be  there  when  we've  finished, 
and  the  length  value  will  be  in  the  X 
register. 

First,  test  specifically  for  the  one 
instruction  that  defies  the  pattern — 
JSR,  opcode  $20,  with  a  length  of  3. 


2045  LDX  #$03 
2047  CMP  #$20 
2049    BEQ   $2069 


;inay  be  length  3 
;test  for  $20 
;yes,  so  we're 
done 


Address  $2069  represents  the  end 
of  our  analysis.  As  you  can  see  above, 
we've  preloaded  X  with  3 — the  right 
value — so  we  can  branch  directly  to 
our  completion  address.  Preloading  X 
makes  for  smooth  coding. 

Next,  we  test  the  opcode  in  A 


against  a  fixed  mask  of  $9F  stored  at 
address  $2081.  (Wouldn't  it  be  nice  to 
have  immediate-mode  addressing 
available  for  the  BIT  instruction?) 

If  none  of  the  bits  match,  the  Z  flag 
will  be  set.  Mask  $9F  has  six  bits  set. 
The  only  instructions  that  will  set  the  Z 
nag  are  opcodes  $00  (BRK),  $40  (RTI). 
and  $60  (RTS).  Value  $20  would  also 
match,  but  we've  already  handled  it. 
When  any  of  the  length- 1  codes  are  de- 
tected, the  program  goes  to  $2069. 


204B   LDX    #S01 
204D  BIT     S2081 
2050    BEQ   S2069 


;may  be  length  I 
;test  against  $9F 
;exit  if  it  is 


Now  we  test  against  a  mask  of 
$08  stored  at  $2082.  Only  a  single  bit 
is  set  in  this  number.  Which  opcodes 
will  it  extract?  If  you  wrote  the  opcode 
in  hexadecimal,  you'd  see  that  this 
coding  will  identify  all  instructions 
whose  last  digit  (in  hex)  is  less  than  8. 
Opcodes  like  $A2  (LDX),  $30  (BMI), 
$85  (STA),  and  dozens  of  others  will 
take  this  exit  with  length  2. 

2052  LDX  #$02  ;niay  be  length  2 
2054  BIT  $2082  ;test  against  $08 
2057    BEQ    $2069  ;exitifitis 

About  half  of  the  possible  op- 
codes now  have  been  identified.  Next, 
we  extract  the  codes  whose  hex  repre- 
sentation ends  in  8  or  A.  We  accom- 
plish this  by  using  a  mask  of  $05, 
which  is  stored  at  $2083. 

2059    LDX    #$01     ;may  be  length  1 


205B   BIT     $2083  ;test  against  $05 
205E   BEQ    S2069  ;exitifitis 

All  that's  left  are  opcodes  ending 
in  (hex)  9,  B,  C,  D,  E,  and  F  Those 
ending  in  B  and  F  are  not  legitimate 
instructions.  The  remaining  opcodes 
are  length  3,  with  one  important  ex- 
ception. An  even  first  digit  (in  hex) 
followed  by  9  will  be  a  length-2  in- 
struction. For  example,  LD.A  immedi- 
ate is  coded  as  $A9.  We  can  test  for 
this  combination  with  a  mask  of  $16. 

2060  LDX   #$02    ;may  be  length  2 

2062  BIT     $2084  ;test  against  $16 

2065  BEQ    $2069  ;exitifitis 

2067  LDX    #$03    ;eise  set  length  3 

2069  (analysis  is  complete) 

The  BIT  intruction  came  through 
with  stunning  elegance  and  efficiency.  It 
takes  time  and  care  to  get  the  masks 
correct  and  in  their  most  elTicient  order. 

In  the  accompanying  B.ASIC  pro- 
gram, I've  added  a  hex  input  routine 
to  precede  the  above  code  and  a  brief 
output  routine  to  follow  it.

"One  day  they  rushed  her  to  the 
hospital  with  leul<;emia.  She  needed 
blood  urgently,  so  I  went  and  gave... 
She's  in  remission  now,  but  every 
couple  of  months  I  go  and  give  blood. 

"Because  I  know  someone  else's 
Andrea  may  need  it. " 

When  was  the  last  time  you  gave 
blood? 

Blood.  Give  a  little,  so  someone  can  live.

RIVERA 


Knowing  the  multiplication  tables 
is  intrinsic  to  all  multiplication 
and  division  operations.  Multi- 
plication is  one  of  the  major 
components  in  the  study  of  mathe- 
matics. Therefore,  memorizing  the 
multiplication  tables  is  a  necessary  in- 
gredient in  understanding  mathematics. 

Memorizing  the  multiplication 
tables  takes  time,  effort,  and  plenty  of 
practice.  This  educational  program  is 
designed  to  help  students  learn  those 
tables  in  a  colorful  and  friendly 
environment. 

Getting  Started 

Times  Table  Tutor  h  written  in 
BASIC.  Enter  the  program  by  using 
The  Automatic  Proofreader;  see  "Typ- 
ing Aids"  elsewhere  in  this  section. 
When  you've  finished  typing  in  Times 
Table  Tutor,  be  sure  to  save  a  copy  to 
disk. 

Using  the  Program 

Times  Table  Tutor  begins  with  a 
menu.  Students  have  the  choice  of 
practicing  an  entire  set  of  multiplica- 
tion tables,  a  single  set,  or  quitting  the 
program. 

Practicing  an  entire  set  drills  stu- 
dents with  random  multiplication 
problems,  with  numbers  ranging  from 
0  to  9,  The  program  provides  correct 
answers  whenever  a  user  gives  an  in- 
correct answer.  Students  can  correct 
mistakes  before  they  press  Return  by 
using  the  Delete  key.  The  drilling  con- 
tinues until  the  user  presses  the  back- 
arrow  key. 

Practicing  a  single  set  drills  stu- 
dents with  a  specific  set  of  problems. 
Times  Table  Tutor  asks  which  set  to 
drill.  Students  may  choose  any  set 
from  0  to  9.  If  the  user  enters  5,  for  ex- 
ample, the  program  presents  5X2=, 
5  X  3  =,  5  X  9  =,  and  so  on.  This 
continues  until  the  user  has  correctly 
answered  all  of  the  problems  in  the 
set.  At  this  point,  the  program  asks 
whether  or  not  the  student  wants  to 
repeat  the  set.  Entering  No  returns  the 
student  to  the  main  menu. 

Times  Table  Tutor  uses  large  and 
colorful  digits  that  help  make  learning 


pleasant.  Sound  effects  after  correct  or 
incorrect  answers  also  add  to  the 
learning  environment.  While  nothing 
can  make  memorizing  the  multiplica- 
tion tables  easy.  Times  Table  Tutor 
makes  it  more  exciting  than  doing  re- 
petitive drills  with  pencil  and  paper. 
Some  might  even  think  it's  fun.

FRED        KARG 


After  months  of  backbreaking 
labor,  digging  at  the  base  of 
Pharaoh's  Pyramid,  you've  final- 
I  ly  uncovered  the  doors  to  eight 
crypts  that  may  lead  to  a  fabulous 
treasure.  You  check  each  crypt,  but 
there's  no  treasure  to  be  found.  Has 
the  Pharaoh  outvvitted  you? 

You're  not  about  to  give  up 
before  you've  solved  the  Pharaoh's 
riddle.  You're  sure  the  entrance  to  the 
pyramid  is  here,  if  only  you  can  un- 
ravel its  key.  You  deduce  that  if  open- 
ing no  single  door  provides  access  to 
the  pyramid  and  its  hidden  treasure, 
then  perhaps  all  of  the  doors  must  be 
open  before  the  secret  entrance  re- 
veals itself. 

As  you  set  out  to  test  your  theory, 
you're  surprised  to  find  that  the  doors 
are  linked  mechanically.  Opening  and 
closing  one  door  triggers  a  mechanism 
in  one  or  more  of  the  others.  There 
seems  to  be  a  consistent  pattern  as  to 
how  the  doors  are  linked,  but  you  re- 
alize that  you'll  need  luck,  persistence, 
and  intelligence  to  open  all  doors. 

Getting  Started 

Pharaoh's  Revenge  is  written  entirely 
in  BASIC.  Type  it  in  using  The  Auto- 
matic Proofreader;  see  "Typing  Aids" 
elsewhere  in  this  section.  Be  sure  to 
save  a  copy  after  you've  finished  typ- 
ing it  in.  When  you're  ready  to  take  on 
the  Pharaoh,  simply  load  and  run  the 
program. 

Playing  the  Game 

Three  challenging  levels  of  play  have 
been  included  in  the  game.  At  the  easy 
level,  all  doors  are  connected  in  pairs. 
Open  one  door  and  a  second  one 
opens.  If  that  second  door  is  already 
open,  then  it  closes.  At  the  difficult 
level,  each  door  may  be  linked  to  one, 
two,  or  three  others.  Finally,  the  level 
for  superbrains  requires  you  to  pass 
successfully  through  three  tiers  before 
you  can  gain  entrance.  To  open  a  spe- 
cific door,  just  type  the  number  that 
appears  above  it.  Depending  on  their 
previous  states,  other  doors  associated 
with  it  will  either  open  or  close. 
The  game  keeps  track  of  how 


many  moves  it  takes  in  your  attempt 
to  gain  access  to  the  treasure.  If  you 
get  frustrated,  you  can  close  all  the 
doors  at  any  time  by  pressing  the  A 
key.  If  the  Pharaoh's  curse  proves  to 
be  too  much,  press  S  to  see  the  solu- 
tion. The  numbers  of  the  key  doors 
will  be  highlighted  in  green.  Enter 
these  numbers  to  solve  the  puzzle.  If 
you  choose  to  look  at  the  solution,  the 
treasure  will,  of  course,  elude  you,  and 
the  Pharaoh  will  have  his  revenge  on 
yet  another  treasure  seeker.

ROGRAMS 


DAVID         BRAY 


Programmers  often  use  com- 
mands and  routines  repeatedly  in 
their  source  code.  Since  Commo- 
dore's BASIC  editor  and  the  ma- 
jority of  assembly  language  editors 
don't  have  a  cut-and-paste  option, 
you  have  to  retype  a  lot  of  code.  WeU, 
not  anymore.  With  Ditto,  you  can 
grab  sections  of  code,  partial  lines,  or 
blocks  of  text  and  then  copy  them 
elsewhere  in  your  program. 

Experiment  with  Ditto.  You'll 
find  dozens  of  useful  applications  for 
this  versatile  little  program. 

Getting  Started 

Ditto  is  written  entirely  in  BASIC. 
Type  it  in  using  The  Automatic  Proof- 
reader. See  "Typing  Aids"  elsewhere 
in  this  section.  Be  sure  to  save  a  copy 
to  disk  when  you've  finished  typing. 
When  you're  ready  to  use  Ditto,  sim- 
ply load  and  run  the  program. 

First,  you're  asked  if  you  want  to 
create  a  disk  file.  This  option  is  used 
for  customizing  Ditto.  For  the  time 
being,  answer  No,  as  we'll  discuss  cus- 
tomizing later.  You'll  then  see  a  mes- 
sage that  says  Editor  Activated.  Now 
you  can  load  and  edit  a  program  or 
begin  to  write  one.  Ditto  is  especially 
useful  when  writing  assembly  lan- 
guage programs.  When  using  Ditto, 
you  have  the  following  commands  at 
your  fingertips. 

fl  Begin  block  define. 

D  End  block  define. 

fS  Clear  defined  block. 

f7  Copy  defined  block. 

When  you  want  to  copy  some- 
thing, move  your  cursor  to  the  begin- 
ning of  the  block  and  press  fl .  Move 
your  cursor  to  the  end  of  the  block 
and  press  f3.  This  defined  block  is 
then  highlighted.  Move  the  cursor  to 
the  place  you  want  to  copy  the  block 
and  press  f7. 

Customizing  the  Program 

To  customize  Ditto,  first  load  the 
BASIC  program  and  list  the  first  few 
lines.  The  default  highlight  color  is  de- 
termined by  the  COLR  variable  in 


line  3.  The  default  color  is  black,  but 
you  can  change  it  to  any  of  the  64's  1 6 
colors  by  supplying  a  new  value,  rang- 
ing from  0  to  15.  Once  you've  entered 
a  new  highlight  color,  run  the  program. 
You  are  then  asked  if  you  want  to 
create  a  disk  file.  Answer  Yes,  and  the 
program  saves  a  machine  language 
(ML)  version  of  itself  to  disk  with  the 
filename  you  specify.  The  new  ML 
version  of  Ditto  can  be  loaded  by  typ- 
ing L0AD"///ename",8,l  and  activat- 
ed by  typing  SYS49 1 52.

How  It  Wort(S 

As  Ditto  runs,  it  constantly  checks  for 
keyboard  input  at  vector  788  and  789. 
When  the  fl  and  O  keys  are  detected. 
Ditto  memorizes  the  entire  screen  to 
keep  the  data  intact. 

When  f7  is  pressed,  the  block  is 
stored  in  the  keyboard  buffer  one 
character  at  a  time  to  simulate  the 
user  actually  retyping  the  information. 
This  allows  the  Commodore  editor  to 
do  the  work  of  inserting  lines  when 
necessary.  For  example,  if  you  add 
something  to  a  line  that  contains  ap- 
proximately 35  characters,  an  extra 


line  is  inserted  to  hold  the  additional 
data  so  it  doesn't  overwrite  the  follow- 
ing line. 

Ditto  is  designed  to  let  a  program- 
mer copy  segments  from  one  line  to 
another.  Although  it  will  let  you  copy 
large  sections  of  text,  the  outcome 
may  not  be  as  you  had  desired  be- 
cause when  the  copy  takes  place,  the 
Commodore  editor  is  unable  to  deter- 
mine where  the  line  boundaries  are, 
causing  some  lines  to  wrap  together. 
This  can  be  avoided  by  copying  only 
segments  from  one  line  to  another. 
Since  the  64's  screen  editor  lets  you 
move  to  certain  lines  and  change  the 
line  number,  there  is  no  real  purpose 
in  copying  whole  lines  of  text  to  an- 
other section  of  a  program. 

When  you  want  to  deactivate  Dit- 
to, press  Run/Stop-Restore.  It  stays  in 
memory,  so  if  you  want  to  reactivate 
it,  simply  type  SYS49 152.

Sometimes  80  columns  just  aren't 
enough.  You  may  want  to  print  a 
spreadsheet  or  other  document, 
but  it  won't  fit  on  an  SO-column 
printer.  It's  too  wide.  You  could  print 
it  smaller  if  your  printer  supports  con- 
densed type,  but  that's  not  always  the 
best  answer.  For  times  like  this,  you 
need  Right/Side. 

Right /Side  \s  a  sideways  file 
printer  for  sequential  files.  It's  de- 
signed primarily  to  be  used  with 
SpeedScript  for  printing  word  proces- 
sor files  and  charts  that  are  up  to  255 
columns  wide.  It's  also  handy  for 
printing  addresses  on  large  manila 
envelopes  that  have  to  be  fed  vertical- 
ly into  narrow-carriage  printers, 
Right/Side  should  work  with  all  odd- 
numbered  Commodore  and  compati- 
ble dot-matrix  printers  such  as  the 
Okidata  120  and  the  Star  Gemini  II. 

Typing  It  In 

Right/Side  consists  of  two  programs. 
The  first  program  is  written  in  BASIC. 
To  ensure  accurate  entry,  use  The 
Automatic  Proofreader.  See  "Typing

PROGRAM  FOR 

THE  64. 


Aids"  elsewhere  in  this  section.  When 
you've  finished,  be  sure  to  save  a  copy 
to  disk. 

The  second  program  is  written  in 
machine  language.  To  enter  it,  you'll 
need  to  use  MLX,  our  machine  lan- 
guage entry  program  (see  "Typing 
Aids").  The  MLX  prompts,  and  the 
values  you  should  enter,  are  as 
follows: 

Starting  address:  COOO 
Ending  address:    C1S7 

When  you've  finished  typing,  be 
sure  to  save  a  copy  of  the  program 
with  the  filename  RIGHT/SIDE.ML 
before  you  leave  MLX.  When  you're 
ready  to  use  Right/Side,  simply  load 
and  run  it  as  you  would  any  BASIC 
program. 

Using  the  Program 

When  creating  a  sequential  file  for 
Right/Side,  the  margin  for  the  right 
side  of  the  text  will  be  printed  at 
what's  normally  the  top  of  the  paper. 
In  SpeedScript,  set  the  right  maipn  to

your  choice  of  widths  up  to  255.  If 
you  choose  a  number  that  is  more 
than  the  length  of  the  longest  hne,  the 
printer  will  space  down  that  number 
oflines.  The  maximum  number  of 
lines  Right/Side  will  print  is  80,  the 
normal  printer  width.  The  left  margin 
should  be  set  to  0. 

Before  you  can  use  Right/Side, 
you  must  first  convert  your  original 
file  or  document  to  a  sequential  file. 
To  do  that  from  SpeedScript,  press 
Shift-Ctrl-R  then  press  D  to  print 
your  document  to  disk  as  a  sequential 
file.  Next,  load  and  run  Right/Side. 

When  the  Right/Side  menu  ap- 
pears, you  must  first  select  fl.  Create 
Right/Side  File,  to  convert  the  se- 
quential file  into  a  Right/Side  file.  En- 
ter the  name  of  your  sequential  file 
and  then  the  name  of  the  file  you'll  be 
creating.  The  letters  R/S  are  added 
automatically  as  a  prefix  to  indicate  to 
the  program  that  this'is  a  Right/Side 
document.  Press  Return  on  a  blank 
line  to  return  to  the  main  menu. 

To  print  your  file  sideways,  sim- 
ply choose  f2,  Print  Right/Side  Files, 
and  enter  the  name  of  the  newly  creat- 
ed Right/Side  file.  You  don't  have  to 
include  the  R/S  prefix — it's  added 
automatically.  Next,  choose  between

Y'  ou  live  in  the  savage  world  of  2 
million  B.C.  The  earth  is  domi- 
nated by  dinosaurs,  all  roaming 
the  planet  each  day  in  search  of 
food.  Surprisingly,  these  huge  reptiles 
crave  one  of  the  smallest  and  weakest 
creatures  on  the  planet:  the  Neander- 
thal. Neanderthals  are  neither  man 
nor  ape,  but  a  tasty  breed  of  evolution 
caught  in  the  middle. 

You  belong  to  a  caveman  tribe 
that  dwells  on  a  mountainside.  Your 
people  live  in  constant  fear  of  being 
devoured  by  the  huge  carnivores.  So, 
you've  been  appointed  as  cave  sentry. 
You  must  patrol  the  mountain  ledges 
and  use  your  trusty  club  to  knock  off 
any  dinosaurs  posing  a  threat  to  your 
people.  Green  tyrannosaurs  and  red 
pterodactyls  are  your  chief  concerns. 

Typing  It  In 

Caveman  is  written  entirely  in  ma- 
chine language,  so  you  must  use  MLX 
to  type  it  in.  After  you've  loaded  and 
run  MLX.  respond  to  the  prompts 
with  the  values  below. 

Starting  address:    $0801 
Ending  address:    S1951 

When  you've  finished  typing,  be 
sure  to  save  the  program  to  disk.  To 
play,  plug  a  joystick  in  port  2  and  then 
load  and  run  the  program.  At  the  right 
side  of  the  screen,  the  high  score,  cur- 
rent score,  lives  remaining,  and  level 
number  are  displayed. 

Playing  the  Game 

Caveman  is  set  on  a  mountainside 
that's  divided  into  28  levels,  each  one 
subdivided  into  eight  ledges.  Once 
you've  conquered  a  level,  you  move 
on  to  a  higher,  more  difficult  one  with 
faster  dinosaurs.  If  you  survive 
through  the  28th  level,  you  return  to 
the  1st  level. 

Move  the  joystick  up  or  down  to 
change  the  level.  When  you're  ready 
to  begin,  press  the  fire  button.  The 
caveman  will  appear  in  the  center  of  a 
ledge.  Initially,  he  appears  in  a  pro- 
tected state  and  will  remain  safe  until 
you  press  the  fire  button. 


The  caveman  is  quite  agile  and 
moves  around  by  jumping  or  walking 
off  the  ledges.  Push  the  joystick  for- 
ward to  jump  straight  up.  While  air- 
borne, push  the  stick  left  or  right  to 
move  onto  a  higher  ledge.  Pull  back 
on  the  stick  to  leap  across  small  gaps. 
Be  careful  though — falling  off  the 
bottom  ledge  spells  doom  for  one  of 
the  caveman's  five  lives. 


SAVE  YOUR 
PREHISTORIC  BUDDIES 
FROM  MAN-EATING 

DINOSAURS  IN  THIS 
DELIGHTFUL  ARCADE 

GAME  FOR  THE  64, 
JOYSTICK  REQUIRED. 


To  clear  a  level,  you  must  knock 
the  green  tyrannosaurs  from  the  ledge 
while  avoiding  the  red  pterodactyls. 
When  you're  lined  up  with  a  dinosaur, 
press  the  fire  button  to  throw  the  club. 
If  you  hit  him,  he  falls  from  the  ledge 
and  you  score  100  points. 

You  must  avoid  the  pterodactyls 
because  they  cannot  be  knocked 
down.  You  can  use  your  club  to  mo- 
mentarily stun  them,  or  you  can  leap 
over  them  when  they're  close.  You  re- 
ceive ten  points  each  lime  you  hit  a 
pterodactyl  even  though  you  can't 
knock  one  down.  When  all  dinosaurs 
have  been  eliminated,  the  caveman 
moves  on  to  the  next  level.

LATINO 


Tank  Shootout  begins  with  two 
hostile  armies  lined  up  like 
pieces  on  a  chess  board.  Instead 
of  an  open  space  between  these 
opposing  forces,  the  field  is  filled  with 
numerous  obstacles  that  block  the  ar- 
mies' field  of  fire.  Across  the  bottom 
of  the  screen,  a  row  of  missiles  waits. 

You  command  one  army,  and 
your  opponent  controls  the  other.  The 
object  of  the  game  is  to  maneuver 
your  forces  around  the  obstacles  and 
capture  the  enemy  command  post. 

Each  player  starts  with  a  force  of 
ten  tanks,  1 1  soldiers,  five  rockets, 
and  a  command  post  that  resembles  a 
castle.  Once  you  start  a  soldier  or  tank 
moving,  it  will  continue  until  it  strikes 
an  obstacle.  If  an  enemy  piece  is  with- 
in range,  your  soldier  or  tank  will 
automatically  fire  al  it. 

Getting  Started 

Tank  Shootout  is  written  entirely  in 
machine  language.  Enter  the  program 
with  MLX,  our  machine  language  en- 
try program.  See  "Typing  Aids"  else- 
where in  this  section.  When  MLX 
prompts  you,  respond  with  the  values 
given  below. 

Starting  address:    0801 
Ending  address:    1A80 

When  you've  finished  typing  in  the 
data,  be  sure  to  save  a  copy  to  disk 
before  exiting  MLX. 

Although  it's  written  in  machine 
language.  Tank  Shootout  loads  and 
runs  like  a  BASIC  program.  When 
you  and  a  friend  are  ready  to  play, 
plug  a  joystick  into  each  port;  then 
load  the  program  and  type  RUN, 

Into  Battle 

Before  starting  the  game,  the  two  play- 
ers should  agree  on  whether  to  play 
until  one  of  the  command  posts  is  de- 
stroyed or  until  one  of  the  players 
loses  all  of  his  or  her  pieces. 

To  play,  use  the  joystick  to  move 
your  flickering  rectangle  until  it  cov- 
ers the  piece  you  want  to  move.  Press 
the  fire  button  and  hold  it  down  while 
you  move  the  stick  in  the  direction 


you  want  the  piece  to  move.  Hold  it  in 
that  direction  and  then  release  the  fire 
button.  The  piece  will  move  on  its 
own  until  it  strikes  an  obstacle  or 
reaches  an  edge  of  the  screen.  To  halt 
a  piece,  put  the  rectangle  on  it  and 
press  and  release  the  fire  button. 

Please  note  that  pieces  will  shoot 
automatically  when  they  meet  an  ene- 
my. (If  a  piece  does  not  shoot  when 
you  think  it  should,  look  closer;  you 
will  find  that  the  enemy  piece  is  out-

side  your  piece's  field  of  fire.) 

The  tanks  can  move  and  shoot  in 
all  four  directions.  The  soldiers  can 
move  in  all  four  directions  but  can 
shoot  only  left  and  right.  (Soldiers  are 
still  dangerous  because  they  fire  much 
faster  than  the  tanks.) 

The  rockets  work  in  a  different 
manner.  Once  you've  ordered  them  to 
move  with  the  joystick,  they  will  only 
move  up.  Once  launched,  they  will  de- 
stroy any  piece  in  their  path,  friend  or 
foe.  They  continue  until  they  hit  a 
wall  and  explode  or  until  they  hit  the 
lop  of  the  screen.  Be  extra  careful  with 
the  two  missiles  that  are  located  be- 
neath your  army.  Generally,  you 
should  use  those  two  as  a  defensive 


measure  and  only  as  a  last  resort. 

Soldiers  will  take  5  hits  before 
dying.  Tanks  will  lake  1 5,  and  rockets, 
25.  The  command  post  is  the  weakest 
piece.  It  will  explode  with  the  first  hit. 
If  you  are  playing  to  destroy  command 
posts,  plan  carefully  how  to  defend 
yours.  You  can  start  a  fresh  game  at 
any  time  by  tapping  the  Restore  key.  Q

NELSON 


The  Automatic  Proofreader  helps  you 
type  in  program  listings  for  the  128 
and  64  and  prevents  nearly  every  kind 
of  typing  mistake. 

Type  in  the  Proofreader  exactly 
as  listed.  Because  the  program  can't 
check  itself,  type  carefully  to  avoid 
mistakes.  Don't  omit  any  lines,  even 
if  they  contain  unusual  commands. 
After  you've  finished,  save  a  copy 
before  running  it. 

Next,  type  RUN  and  press  Re- 
turn. When  the  program  displays  the 
message  Proofreader  Active,  you're 
ready  to  type  in  a  BASIC  program. 

Every  time  you  finish  typing  a 
line  and  press  Return,  the  Proofreader 
displays  a  two-letter  checksum  in  the 
upper  left  comer  of  the  screen.  Com- 
pare this  result  with  the  two-letter 
checksum  printed  to  the  left  of  the 
line  in  the  program  listing.  If  the  let- 
ters match,  it's  almost  certain  the  line 
was  typed  correctly.  If  not,  check  for 
your  mistake  and  correct  the  line. 

The  Proofreader  ignores  spaces 
not  enclosed  in  quotation  marks,  so 
you  can  omit  or  add  spaces  between 
keywords  and  still  see  a  matching 
checksum.  However,  spaces  inside 
quotes  are  significant,  so  the  program 
pays  attention  to  them. 

The  Proofreader  does  not  accept 
keyword  abbreviations  (for  example,  ? 
instead  of  PRINT).  If  you  use  abbre- 
viations, you  can  check  the  tine  later 
by  LISTing  it,  moving  the  cursor  back 
to  the  line,  and  pressing  Return. 

If  you're  using  the  Proofreader  on 
the  1 28,  do  not  perform  any  GRAPH- 
IC commands  while  the  Proofreader  is 
active.  When  you  perform  a  com- 
mand tike  GRAPHIC  1,  the  computer 
moves  everything  at  the  start  of 
BASIC  program  space — including  the 
Proofreader — to  another  memory 
area,  causing  it  to  crash.  The  same 
thing  happens  if  you  run  any  program 
with  a  GRAPHIC  command  while 
the  Proofreader  is  in  memory. 

Thou^  the  Proofreader  doesn't 
interfere  with  other  BASIC  opera- 
tions, it's  a  good  idea  to  disable  it 
before  running  another  program.  The 
simplest  way  to  disable  it  is  to  turn  the 
computer  off  then  on.  A  gentler  meth- 
od is  to  SYS  to  the  computer's  built-in 
reset  routine  (65341  for  the  128,

HOW  TO  TYPE  IN 


Each  month,  Gazette  publishes  pro- 
grams for  the  Commodore  1 28  and 
64.  Each  program  is  clearly  marked  by 
title  and  vereion.  Be  sure  to  type  in 
the  correct  version  for  your  machine. 
Ail  64  programs  run  on  the  128  in  64 
mode.  Be  sure  to  read  the  instructions 
in  the  corresponding  article.  This  can 
save  time  and  eliminate  any  questions 
which  might  arise  after  you  begin 
typing. 

We  regularly  publish  two  pro- 
grams designed  to  make  typing  easier 
The Aulomatic  Proofreader,  for 
BASIC  programs,  and  MLX,  for  en- 
tering machine  language  programs. 

When  entering  a  BASIC  pro- 
gram, be  especially  carefiil  with 
DATA  statements,  as  they  are  ex- 
tremely sensitive  to  errors.  A  mis- 
typed number  in  a  DATA  statement 
can  cause  your  machine  to  "lock  up" 
(you'll  have  no  control  over  the  com- 
puter). If  this  happens,  the  only  re- 
course is  to  turn  your  computer  off 
and  then  on,  erasing  what  was  in 
memory.  This  could  cause  you  to  lose 
valuable  data,  so  be  sure  to  save  a  pro- 
gram before  you  run  it.  If  your  com- 
puter crashes,  you  can  always  reload 
the  program  and  look  for  the  error. 


Special  Characters 

Most  of  the  programs  Usted  in  each  is- 
sue contain  special  control  characters. 
To  facilitate  typing  in  any  programs 
from  Gazette,  use  the  following  listing 
conventions. 

The  most  common  type  of  con- 
trol characters  in  our  listings  appear  as 
words  within  braces:  {DOWN} 
means  to  press  the  cursor-down  key; 
{5  Spaces}  means  to  press  the  space 
bar  five  times. 

To  indicate  that  a  key  should  be 
shifted  (hold  down  the  Shift  key  while 
pressing  another  key),  the  character  is 
underlined.  For  example,  A  means 
hold  down  the  Shift  key  and  press  A. 
You  may  see  strange  characters  on 
your  screen,  but  that's  to  be  expwcted. 
If  you  find  a  number  followed  by  an 
underlined  key  enclosed  in  braces  (for 
example,  {8  A}),  type  the  key  as  many 
times  as  indicated  (in  our  example, 
enter  eight  shifted  A's). 

If  a  key  is  enclosed  in  special 
brackets,  %  | ,  hold  down  the  Com- 
modore key  (at  the  lower  left  comer  of 
the  keyboard)  and  press  the  indicated 
character. 

Rarely,  you'll  see  a  single  letter  of 
the  alphabet  enclosed  in  braces.  This 


can  be  entered  on  the  Commodore  64 
by  pressing  the  Ctrl  key  while  typing 
the  letter  in  braces.  For  example,  {A} 
means  to  press  Ctrl-A. 

The  Quote  Mode 

Although  you  can  move  the  cursor 
around  the  screen  with  the  Crsr  keys, 
often  a  programmer  will  want  to 
move  the  cursor  under  program  con- 
trol. This  is  seen  in  examples  such  as 
{LEFT}  and  {HOME}  in  the  program 
Mstings.  The  only  way  the  computer 
can  tell  the  difference  between  direct 
and  programmed  cursor  control  is  the 
quote  mode. 

Once  you  press  the  quote  key, 
you're  in  quote  mode.  This  mode  can 
be  confiising  if  you  mistype  a  charac- 
ter and  cursor  left  to  change  it.  You'll 
see  a  graphics  symbol  for  cursor  left. 
In  this  case,  you  can  use  the  E>el  key 
to  back  up  and  edit  the  line.  Type  an- 
other quotation  mark  and  you're  out 
of  quote  mode.  If  things  really  get  con- 
fiising, you  can  exit  quote  mode  sim- 
ply by  pressing  Return.  Then  cursor 
up  to  the  mistyped  line  and  fix  it.  If 
the  mistake  involves  cursor  move- 
ment, however,  you  must  press  the 
quote  key  to  reenter  quote  mode.      H

TOTAL  WORD 


Sharp,  professional-looking  docu- 
ments are  every  professional's 
goal.  Clients  expect  it.  You 
should  deliver  it.  To  meet  these 
high  expectations  and  achieve  just  the 
right  shine,  word  processing  manufac- 
turers are  including  more  desktop 
publishing  features,  such  as  multiple 
typefaces,  the  ability  to  integrate 
graphics  with  text,  and  support  for  la- 
ser printers.  Total  Word,  from  the 
makers  of  Volkswriter,  blends  word 
processing  and  desktop  publishing 
into  one  impressive  package. 

Total  Word  has  many  of  the  fea- 
tures of  the  best  word  processors,  in- 
cluding mail  merge,  a  spelling 
checker,  a  thesaurus,  word  counting, 
math  functions,  automatic  hyphen- 
ation, macros,  and  so  on.  Unlike  oth- 
er word  processors,  however,  Total 
Word  has  graphics  and  formatting  ca- 
pabilities that  may  well  win  you  over 
if  you're  really  interested  in  a  pol- 
ished, professional  look  for  your 
documents. 

Powerful  formatting  features  are 
available  through  Total  Word's  easy- 
to-use  style  sheets,  which  simplify 
document  layout.  You  select  a  para- 
graph or  a  blank  line  and  tj-pe  F9.  The 
section  layouts  menu  lets  you  change 
line  spacing,  margins,  tabs,  columns, 
and  other  options.  If  you  need  a  previ- 
ously saved  section  layout,  you  select 
it  from  this  menu  also. 

All  of  the  different  section  layouts 
can  be  scrolled  through  and  then  used, 
edited,  or  copied.  The  program  ties 
style  sheets  to  the  documents  by  file- 
name extension  so  the  same  style 
sheet  can  be  used  with  other  docu- 
ments. If,  for  example,  you  create  a 
style  sheet  for  a  proposal  in  the  file 
BILL.PRO,  you  can  use  the  same 
style  sheet  when  you  write  another 
proposal  simply  by  using  the  same  ex- 
tension. Call  your  new  proposal 
TOM. PRO,  and  you're  in  business. 


Now  you  can  concentrate  on  the  con- 
tent of  this  winning  proposal  rather 
than  on  its  format. 

Like  macros  in  other  word  pro- 
cessors. Total  Word's  macros  speed 
you  right  along.  However,  this  pro- 
gram offers  a  distinct  advantage:  sim- 
plicity. Anyone  can  use  its  macros. 
Anyone  can  appreciate  their  power. 

The  only  graphics  Total  Word 
can  use  in  its  documents  are  those 
captured  from  the  screen  with  the 
Snapshot  program  provided  in  the 
package.  Using  the  graphics  menu, 
you  can  insert,  reduce,  enlarge,  light- 
en, darken,  or  reverse  images. 


Choose  from  a  variety  of  typefaces. 

Before  you  print,  you  have  the 
option  to  view  the  page  with  Total 
Word's  preview  function.  The  page  is 
displayed  on  the  screen  as  it  would  ap- 
pear when  printed.  Although  it's  too 
rough  a  display  to  proof  more  than 
the  general  layout,  it  is  useful  for 
checking  margins,  headers,  and  col- 
umns. There's  also  a  zoom  feature  to 
give  you  a  closer  look  at  the  text  and 
layout.  You  can  move  around  the 
page  in  the  zoom  view,  but  no  editing 
is  possible.  Since  graphics  are  not  dis- 
played in  the  editing  mode,  the  pre- 
view function  is  useful  for  the 
placement  of  graphics. 

When  you're  ready  to  print  your 
document,  all  of  your  printer's  capa- 
bilities can  be  used.  Total  Word  sup- 
ports a  large  number  of  printers 


including  the  HP  LaserJet  family  and 
PostScript  laser  printers.  If  you  have 
the  standard  Hewlett-Packard  soft 
fonts  or  cartridge  fonts.  Total  Word 
has  the  drivers  to  support  them.  Soft 
fonts  from  programs  such  as  Bit- 
stream  Fontware  and  Digi-Fonts  or 
the  standard  PostScript  fonts  can  also 
be  used.  The  program  uses  only  a  lim- 
ited range  of  point  sizes  even  in  Post- 
Script, but  it  is  an  adequate  number 
for  most  word  processing  needs. 

Although  Total  Word  is  market- 
ed as  a  word  processor  with  desktop 
publishing  power,  its  real  strength  is 
scientific  and  technical  word  process- 
ing. With  an  extremely  large  extended 
character  set,  you  have  the  capability 
to  use  complex  mathematical  formu- 
las and  organic  chemistry  symbols. 
However,  you  do  need  a  laser  printer 
to  print  these  characters. 

Total  Word  offers  nine  alternate 
keyboard  layouts  that  let  you  take  ad- 
vantage of  the  extended  characters. 
Using  simple  keystroke  combinations, 
you  select  an  alternate  keyboard  from 
the  menu  that  corresponds  to  the 
character  set  you  wish  to  use.  A  dis- 
play appears  at  the  top  of  the  screen 
with  the  alternate  characters  mapped 
to  each  key  on  the  keyboard.  You 
then  type  the  necessary  characters  or 
switch  to  another  alternate  keyboard 
to  insert  an  entirely  different  set  of 
characters.  Choose  from  keyboards 
with  special  symbols  for  business,  the 
Greek  alphabet,  math  symbols,  and 
many  others. 

An  impressive  feature  of  Total 
Word  is  its  manual.  Written  with  the 
beginner  in  mind,  the  first  section  of 
the  manual  includes  the  basics  of 
computer  word  processing.  The  sec- 
ond section  uses  specific  sample  files 
such  as  a  business  letter  or  a  newslet- 
ter to  explain  advanced  commands. 
The  final  section  is  for  reference.  Ad- 
vanced users  can  locate  information 
quickly  since  the  manual  is  well  in- 
dexed. After  you've  gleaned  the  basics 
from  the  manual,  an  onscreen  tutorial

major  features  of  Total  Word. 

A  major  weakness  of  Total  Word 
is  the  absence  of  mouse  support. 
^^'hen  it  comes  to  editing  text,  moving 
blocks  of  text,  or  just  moving  the  cur- 
sor to  other  parts  of  the  document,  a 
mouse  is  much  faster  than  the  key-

quite  right  without  mouse  support  in 
the  rapidly  growing  world  of  graphical 
user  interfaces  and  pull-down  menus. 

All  in  all,  Total  Word  is  a  worthy 
competitor  in  the  arena  of  high-

HEAT  WAVE 


The  flag  drops.  Your  engine  comes 
to  life.  All  1 300  horsepower  of  rac- 
ing machine  screams  across  the 
starting  line,  kicking  up  a  monster 
rooster  tail  of  water.  This  is  the  world 
of  superboat  racing. 

In  Heat  Wave,  you  try  to  capture 
the  crown  of  superboat  racing,  the  title 
US-1 .  Race  a  season  and  see  how  your 
points  stack  up  against  the  other  rac- 
ers of  the  circuit. 

Six  preset  courses  provide  plenty 
of  high-speed  challenge,  and  you  can 
create  up  to  ten  different  custom 
courses. 


Try  to  Kandle  the  power  of  a  superboat. 

Select  your  boat  from  one  of  four 
different  types.  I  chose  a  catamaran 
because  it  performs  best  in  calm  water 
and  reaches  speeds  of  100  mph. 

As  a  rookie  to  the  racing  world.  I 
had  to  register  myself  and  my  boat 
before  I  could  race.  And  1  made  good 
use  of  the  practice  sessions,  which  are 
set  up  just  like  the  real  race  but  don't 
affect  your  season  standing.  After 
choosing  a  course,  you  race  the  other 
four  computer-controlled  competitors. 

The  graphics  are  superb,  and  you 
control  the  degree  of  detail.  The 
greater  the  detail,  the  slower  the  game 
speed.  Although  I  didn't  find  the  game 
speed  to  be  a  problem,  occasionally 
the  game  didn't  respond  to  my  key- 
strokes. This  was  quite  irritating  at  the 
starting  flag. 

Qualifying  isn't  easy,  either.  Run- 
ning full  speed  to  the  first  buoy  of  the 
race  and  then  turning  180  degrees  to 
race  full  speed  back  to  the  starting  line 
turns  out  to  be  quite  a  challenge. 

At  first  it's  hard  enough  just 
keeping  track  of  where  you  are  on  the 
course  and  where  you're  going.  But 
once  you've  developed  a  little  profi- 
ciency in  basic  boat  handling,  you'll 
start  to  notice  the  impressive  array  of 
engine  instruments  and  equipment  on 
board.  Pay  attention  to  this  equip- 
ment to  avoid  tanning  aground,  over- 
heating, overrewing,  or  running  out 
of  fuel. 

Winning  in  superboat  racing  is 
more  than  just  being  the  first  to  cross 
the  finish  line.  During  the  course  of  a 
race,  you  can  accumulate  time  penal- 
ties, which  are  added  to  your  finishing 
time.  Missing  a  buoy  or  having  to  re- 
pair your  boat  during  the  race  adds 
minutes  to  your  lime. 

Heal  Wave  is  a  game  of  excite- 
ment and  challenge  that  may  give 
even  Don  Johnson  a  run  for  his  mon- 


ey. With  some  skill  and  a  little  luck, 
you  might  make  it  to  the  winner's 
circle.

The  PB9500  passed,  with  flying 
colors,  a  pretty  stringent  test:  It 
performed  beautifully  for  two  edi- 
tors whose  printing  needs  are  in- 
tense and  ongoing.  We  threw 
everjihing  at  this  printer:  daily 
memos,  article  drafts,  long  proposals 
and  reports  (complete  with  charts), 
and  even  a  book  manuscript  or  two. 
The  printer  threw  back,  with  the  un- 
flappable precision  of  a  machine  do- 
ing what  it's  designed  to  do.  crisply 
reproduced  pages  with  nary  a  smudge 
and  only  the  rarest  of  paper  jams. 

The  printer  is  well  equipped  for 
its  price  (which  should  be  substantial- 
ly below  retail  list  in  the  stores 
through  which  Packard  Bell  markets 
its  products).  Resident  fonts  include 
four  Courier  styles  as  well  as  Portrait 
and  Landscape  line  printer  modes. 
,'\dditional  fonts  can  be  added,  al- 
though the  add-on  slots  are  optional. 
The  printer's  standard  emulation  is 
Hewlett-Packard  Laserjet  II;  you  can 
add  other  emulations  by  way  of  op-

REVIEWS 


MS-DOS 


continued  from  page  90 

This  is  also  one  of  the  quietest  la- 
ser printers  Fve  used.  I  especially  ap- 
preciated the  way  the  printer  powers 
down  its  fan  between  uses.  There's  no 
constant  low  hum  in  the  background 
as  is  customary  with  most  lasers.  The 
idle  mode  is  a  feature  that  other  print- 
er manufacturers  would  do  well  to 
incorporate. 


The  PB9S00  laser  printer  offers  crisply 

reproduced  pages  with  nary  a  smudge 

and  only  the  rarest  of  paper  jams. 


Although  the  printer's  output  is 
rated  at  six  printed  text  pages  per  min- 
ute, I  found  the  unit  capable  of  ex- 
ceeding that  rate  on  all  but  the 
heaviest  of  jobs.  Typical  text  output, 
with  reasonable  margins,  can  easily 
hit  seven  pages  per  minute. 

While  this  is  not  a  printer  for  am- 
bitious desktop  publishing  applica- 
tions, it  did  perform  at  an  acceptable 
speed  when  printing  documents  in- 
volving simple  graphs,  charts,  and 
logos. 

Well-built,  with  a  solid  housing 
and  equally  solid  catches  and  latches, 
the  PB9500  should  hold  up  well  over 
time.  Its  small  footprint  lets  you  place 
it  comfortably  in  the  corner  of  a  desk, 
although  the  paper  tray  adds  to  the 
space  required.  LCD  controls  are  ar- 
ranged along  the  front  of  the  machine. 
Setup  is  simple  and  relatively  fool- 
proof The  few  paper  jams  we  encoun- 
tered were  easily  cleared. 

The  1 50-sheet  input  paper  tray 
included  with  the  printer  can  handle 
letter-  and  legal-size  pages.  The  print- 
er can  also  accommodate  envelopes, 
labels,  and  transparencies. 

The  PB9500  is  a  solid  laser  print- 
er for  text-intensive  operations.  Its 
combination  of  features,  speed,  quiet 
operation,  and  price  make  this  a  good 
choice  for  home  or  business.

ULTRASCRIPT 
PC  PLUS 

Recent  technological  develop- 
ments have  greatly  enhanced  the 
quality  and  capabilities  of  PC 
desktop  publishing.  One  of  them 
is  UltraScrip!  PC  Plus,  a  PostScript 
language-compatible  interpreter  that 
offers  PostScript  compatibihty  on 
non-PostScript  printers.  With  this 
software  marvel,  I  now  have  the  pow- 
er of  PostScript  at  a  fraction  of  the 
cost. 

Although  it  requires  at  least  .A.T 
(80286)  technology,  UltraScript  will 
run  in  as  little  as  640K  of  RAM.  If 
you  have  at  least  800K  of  extended 
memory,  you  can  print  without  exit- 
ing your  application.  You'll  need  four 
megabytes  of  free  disk  space  and  DOS 
3. 1  or  higher,  but  most  AT-compatible 
computers  can  easily  accommodate 
these  requirements.  Your  laser  printer 
will  need  at  least  a  megabyte  of  mem- 
ory to  print  a  full  page  at  300  dpi. 

6''///'ijJ'r/v^/ supports  an  impres- 
sive list  of  printers,  and  even  your 
dot-matrix  printer  can  take  advantage 
of  PostScript  capabilities.  Change 
printers  without  resetting  your  com- 
puter simply  by  running  the  non-me- 
mory-resident version  of  UltraScript 
and  selecting  a  different  printer. 

There  are  two  ways  to  print  with 
UltraScript.  The  first  requires  that  you 
print  your  file  to  disk,  exit  your  appli- 
cation, and  then  print  the  file  with 
UltraScript.  If  you  have  a  megabyte  of 
memory  or  less,  this  is  the  only  way 
UltraScript -mW  work. 


The  second  method  is  to  load  the 
memory-resident  version  of  Ultra- 
Script  and  print  from  within  your  ap- 
plication. You  select  the  PostScript 
driver  for  your  application  and  print 
the  file  as  usual  except  UltraScript  rt- 
directs  the  output  (with  a  program 
called  PCAPTURE)  to  the  PostScript 
interpreter;  then  it  converts  the  Tile  to 
a  bitmap  and  sends  it  to  the  printer. 

The  memory-resident  version  of 
UltraScript  uses  44K  of  regular  mem- 
ory; the  rest  of  the  program  resides  in 
extended  memory.  If  necessary,  the 
print  file  is  written  to  the  hard  disk. 

When  I  first  tried  to  run  OVtra- 
Script.  1  tried  to  print  directly  from 
within  Fentura PuMislierwsing  the 
memor>'-resident  mode.  The  file 
eventually  printed,  but  Ventura  f/Q\x\d 
not  leave  its  print  menu,  and  I  had  to 
reset  the  computer.  I  managed  to 
solve  this  apparent  memory  problem 
only  after  spending  the  good  part  of  a 
day  trying  to  get  through  to  technical 
support  and  then  working  through  a 
solution.  If  I'd  had  customers  waiting, 
it  could  have  cost  me  money.

UltraScript  offers  you  PostScript  com- 
patibility on  non-PostScript  printers. 

After  I  finally  got  UltraScript  up 
and  running,  it  was  a  breeze  to  use. 
Printing  with  the  program  takes  a  lit- 
tle longer,  but  the  wait  is  worth  it. 
PostScript  spoiled  me  with  its  simpli- 
fication of  font  selection.  I  didn't  have 
to  exit  ^/;///w  constantly  to  make 
slight  adjustments  in  font  size. 

UltraScr/pt  comes  with  a  good  se- 
lection of  fonts,  and  the  Plus  edilion 
offers  a  total  of  47  typefaces.  There's 
also  a  version  of  this  program  called 
simply  UltraScript  PC,  which  offers 
22  fewer  typefaces  (six  families)  but

MEGATRMLLER 1: 
THE  ZHODANI 
CONSPIRACY 

Are  you  ready  to  explore  28  star 
systems,  trying  to  prevent  a  cata- 
clysmic galactic  war?  -\re  you  the 
stuff  of  heroes?  You'll  find  out

Zhondani  Conspiracy,  part  1  of  an 
epic  space  adventure. 

Those  familiar  with  role-playing 
board  games  will  recognize  this  as  the 
computerized  version  of  the  popular 
award-winning  Traveller  game.  De- 
signer Marc  Miller  has  broken  new 
ground  with  this  board-to-computer 
translation,  adding  many  arcadelike 
features  to  MegaTraveller.  Still,  the 
game  moves  slower  than  a  tax  refund 
when  it  comes  to  character  develop-

Explore  richly  diverse  planets, 

ment  and  routine  tasks. 

Amazingly  detailed  EGA  graph- 
ics enhance  your  party's  exploration 
of  the  richly  diverse  planets,  each  de- 
fined by  numerous  distinguishing 
characteristics.  For  instance,  you 
might  discover  a  huge  water  worid 
with  a  poisonous  atmosphere  and  a 
small  population  with  a  prestellar 
technology — but  no  starporl  where 
you  might  land.  This  degree  of  detail 
is  evident  throughout  the  game,  from 
weapons  variety  to  vehicle  types  to 
the  colorful  characters  you're  likely  to 
meet  during  your  travels. 

You  get  a  144- page  manual 
crammed  with  background  stot^, 
charts,  diagrams,  and  explanations  of 
every  aspect  of  gamcplay.  Mega- 
Traveller  allows  you  to  create  ex- 
tremely complex  playing  characters  to 
include  in  your  party  of  five. 

Characters  can  develop  up  to  54 
vital  skills,  which  determine  how  suc- 
cessfully they  will  perform  tasks  re- 
quired during  the  game.  It's  advisable 
to  make  each  part>-  member  a  special- 
ist in  several  unique  areas  rather  than 
to  develop  a  group  of,  say,  fighters. 
During  the  game,  characters  can  pay 
for  training  and  education  to  add  new 
skills  or  enhance  existing  abilities. 

Your  ship,  the  Interloper,  must 
be  greatly  upgraded  during  the  game 
to  give  it  the  capabilities  needed  for 
success. 

The  money  for  all  this  training 
and  upgrading  comes  from  trading. 
Saving  the  galaxy  costs  money,  and  an 
elaborate  bartering  system  will  let  you 
earn  credits  through  interplanetary 
trading. 

A/e^arrai'£'//er  supports  Real- 
Sound  as  well  as  digitized  sounds  by 
Covox,  but  you'll  need  600K  of  free 
RAM  to  hear  all  the  sounds.  With  less 
memory,  you'll  hear  only  partial 


sound  effects.  But  even  without  a 
sound  card,  you'll  have  great  sound 
effects. 

With  all  the  obvious  work  that 
went  into  this  game,  I'd  love  to  say  I 
recommend  it  for  everyone,  but  this 
game  isn't  for  everyone.  It  requires  a 
lot  of  methodical  work,  such  as  train- 
ing characters,  earning  money  for  re- 
quired supplies,  and  exploring  vast 
regions.  You'll  need  to  set  aside  a  fair 
chunk  of  time  to  really  explore  what 
MegaTraveller  has  to  offer.  Maybe  if  I 
were  stranded  on  Gilligan's  Island 
and  the  Professor  built  a  386-based 
PC  using  coconut  shells,  bamboo 
sticks,  and  the  never-say-die  batteries 
from  the  radio  for  power. . . .

The  bogey  came  out  of  nowhere.  You  see  him  just 
off  your  tail.  The  adrenalin  hits  you  like  a  fist.  You  call 
your  win^man:  "Viper  One,  I've  got  a  bandit  on  my  si.x. 
This  is  no!  good..." 

The  original  Falcon™  F-16  Fighter  Simulation  was 
acclaimed  for  its  realism.  Now,  Falcon  3.0"'  takes  this 
authenticity  to  the  edge.  The  flight  models  are  real.  The 
terrain  is  real.  The  radar  and  weapons  systems  are  real. 
And  the  threats  are  real.  No  phony  weapons  or  magic 
bullets  here...  just  the  best  civihan  F-16  simulation 
available.  You  don't  just  play  Falcon  3.0,  you  strap 
yourself  in  and  get  ready  for  battle. 

You  go  to  afterburner  and  your  Falcon  jumps, 
slamming  you  back  in  the  seal.  The  MiC  29  has  jus! 
reached  missile  range...  There!  He'sfued. 
the  deadly  rocket  screams  toward  you. 
seeing  nothing  hut  the  heat  of  your  exhaust. 
Without  thinking,  you  drop  a  series  of 
flares  hoping  to  confuse  it,  and  yank  back 
on  the  slick...  50  degrees...  80...  over  the 
top...  your  Head  Up  display  shows  you're 
pulling  9g's... 

With  Falcon  3,0,  you  lead  your  own 
squadron  of  pilots.  Your  missions  are 
straight  from  today's  headlines:  Panama, 
Iraq,  or  some  other  international  hot  spot.  The  moun- 
tains, valleys,  and  rivers  you  fly  over  conform  precisely 
to  military  maps  of  the  areas.

on  HIS  six  now.  This  is  going  to  he  sweet.  As  you  gel  tone 
you  know  he's  yours. 

True  to  the  General  Dynamics  F-16  Falcon, 
Falcon  3,0  gives  you  all  the  exhilaration  of  flying  one 
of  the  most  advanced 
fighters  in  the  world. 
And  all  the  dangers.

With  CIM,  navigation  is  easy  and  fun. 

the  error-correcting  protocofs  for 
down-  and  uploading  files.  Because 
automated  scripts  and  interface  pro- 
grams depend  on  accurate  responses, 
it's  common  for  them  to  lock  up  when 
the  original  interface's  .4SCII  com- 
mands and  prompts  are  garbled  by 
line  noise.  This  shouldn't  be  a  prob- 
lem with  HMI.  because  if  a  command 
or  prompt  isn't  received  perfectly, 
HMI  automatically  sends  it  again. 

With  the  command  line  interface, 
you  might  start  ai  an  opening  menu 
and  make  a  series  of  selections  until 
you  reach  your  destination.  When  you 
do  this  with  CIM,  each  selection 
brings  up  a  new  window  with  a  new 
menu  list.  The  previous  windows  re- 
main onscreen  so  you  can  select  the 
appropriate  window  and  easily  move 
back  and  forth  through  the  levels. 

With  both  the  original  interface 
and  CIM,  you  can  type  GO  and  a  key- 
word to  move  directly  to  a  specific  lo- 
cation. C/.V/ automates  this  process  by 
letting  you  save  these  locations  to  a 
Favorite  Places  menu.  You  can  also 
find  areas  of  interest  by  selecting  Find 
from  the  pull-down  Service  menu. 
Type  in  a  keyword  and  you'll  see  a  list 
of  CompuServe  services  that  are  relat- 
ed to  your  chosen  topic. 

To  search  the  forum  libraries, 
you  select  your  search  parameters  and 
click  on  the  library  section  you  want 
to  search.  A  window  with  a  menu  of 
files  will  open  with  the  entries  that 
qualify.  You  can  scroll  forward  and 
backward  through  the  selections  and 
click  on  a  file.  .Another  window  will 
open,  this  time  with  the  file's  title 
(which  usually  functions  as  a  short  de- 
scription) and  five  buttons:  Next,  Ab- 
stract or  View,  Retrieve,  Mark,  and 
Cancel. 

While  you  can  download  GIF 
files  or  view  them  online  (viewing  is 


no  faster  than  downloading),  you 
can't  do  both.  If  you  decide  you  like  a 
GIF  file  after  you've  viewed  part  of  it, 
you'll  have  to  start  all  over  again  to 
download  it. 

CIM  automates  a  number  of 
other  CompuServe  areas,  including 
messages,  mail,  stock  quotes,  CB  Sim- 
ulator, and  Weather.  In  addition, 
CIM  comes  with  an  excellent  300- 
page  manual  that  also  provides  an  in- 
troduction to  CompuServe's  many 
services. 

CompuServe  has  said  that  the 
original  interface  will  still  be  available 
for  members  who  use  automated 
scripting  programs,  but  the  days  of  the 
command  line  interface  are  num- 
bered. HMI  is  a  great  leap  forward  for 
making  CompuServe  easy  to  use,  and 
CompuSen-e  Information  Manager  is 
an  excellent — and  attractively  priced — 
way  to  use  this  powerful  telecommu- 
nications service.

PRACTIDISK 

There's  no  such  thing  as  enough 
money  or  enough  disk  space.  No 
matter  how  much  capacity  you 
have,  you'll  always  scream  for 
more.  Practidisk,  a  2.88MB  disk  drive 
completely  compatible  with  standard 
PC  hardware  and  lower  capacity  disks, 
is  one  among  a  handful  of  products 
manufactured  in  response  to  that  plea. 

Developed  and  patented  by  To- 
shiba and  manufactured  by  TEAC,  the 
Practidisk  drive  is  the  size  and  shape 
of  a  standard  3'/2-inch  disk  drive,  but 
it  uses  carefully  arranged  barium  fer- 


rite  particles  and  perpendicular  re- 
cording technology  to  squeeze  twice  as 
many  bits  onto  the  tracks. 

Practidisk's  extremely  flexible  8- 
bit  controller  card  works  with  almost 
any  version  of  BIOS  and  any  version 
of  DOS  2.0  or  higher  to  control  any 
capacity  5'/4-  or  3 '/2-inch  floppy  disk 
drive  installed  in  almost  any  PC-, 
XT-,  or  AT-compatible  computer. 


Use  2.88MB,  1.44MB,  and  720K  disks. 

The  drive  and  controller  worked 
flawlessly  on  the  .AT  clone  I  tested, 
but  not  on  a  Commodore  Colt  XT- 
compatible,  even  with  a  replacement 
card  the  company  sent.  A  company 
official  assured  me  that  this  was  a 
very  rare  situation,  encountered  so  far 
only  with  Commodore  PCs. 

Thanks  to  Practidisk's  own  BIOS 
and  driver  program,  you  can  treat 
your  2.88MB  drive  as  if  it  were  just 
another  DOS  device.  The  only  differ- 
ence is  that,  when  you  formal  a  disk, 
you  must  use  a  special  PFORMAT 
command  specifying  the  density  of 
the  disk.  Once  evetything  is  set  up 
and  running,  you  can  use,  for  ex- 
ample, PC  Tools  Deluxe  to  perform  a 
surface  analysis  and  optimization  of 
yourextra-high-denstty  disk. 

You  can  insert  the  drive  in  one  of 
your  drive  bays  or — for  about  $  110 
more — install  an  external  unit,  which 
comes  with  a  cable  with  a  37-pin  D 
connector  on  each  end. 

While  doctoring  regular  disks  for 
use  in  high-density  drives  is  a  popular 
way  to  save  money,  I  don't  recom- 
mend trying  it  with  the  Practidisk 
drive.  The  size  of  the  tracks  and  the 
amount  of  power  used  to  write  data  to 
the  disk  van,'  with  capacity,  and  disks 
not  designed  for  a  given  format  may 
retain  that  format  only  temporarily, 
though  initially  they  appear  to  per- 
form flawlessly.  >

The  principal  anxiety  involved  in 
buying  a  technology  that  IBM  has  not 
annointed,  like  2.88MB  floppy  disk 
drives,  is  that  the  standard  may  end 
up  being  incompatible  with  the  hard- 
ware you  have  purchased.  Therefore, 
people  are  interested  in  whether  a  new 
piece  of  technology  has  industry  sup- 
port. The  manufacturers  o^  Back-It 
support  the  2.88MB  format.  Extra- 
high-density  disks  (virtually  identical 
in  appearance  to  high-capacity  disks 
but  marked  with  the  letters  ED)  are 
available  from  3M  (I  found  them  for 
S32.50  apiece).  Maxell  (slated  to  list  ai 
$162.85  for  a  10-pack),  and  Toshiba. 
Practical  Computer  Technologies  sells 
the  exlra-high-density  disks  for  a  bar- 
gain— S7.00  each.  If,  at  some  point, 
these  disks  lose  favor  to  some  other 
extremely  high-density  disk  standard, 
the  Praclidisk  drive  won't  be  obsolete 
because  it  will  still  be  used  with  720K 
and  1.44MB  disks  and  any  2.88MB 
disks  you  have  on  hand.

3-D 
PROFESSIONAL 

Creating  3-D  graphics  on  the 
Amiga  has  fascinated  me  ever 
since  I  saw  the  Juggler  demo  at 
my  Amiga  dealer's  in  1 986.  Cre- 
ating objects  on  graph  paper  and  typ- 
ing in  coordinates,  or  trying  to  draw 
the  starship  Enterprise  using  only  tri- 
angles, however,  did  not  intrigue  me. 


Now  Cryogenic  Software  has  de- 
veloped 3-D  Professional  the  model- 
ing and  animation  program  for  "the 
rest  of  us."  3-D  Pro  is  extremely  easy 
to  use  and  has  an  intuitive  user  inter- 
face, but  it's  still  very  powerful. 


Scenes  like  this  are  easy  to  render  using 
3-0  Pro's  ray-trace  module. 

Objects  in  3-D  Pro  are  built  from 
simple  shapes,  called  primitives. 
There  are  13  predefined  primitives, 
including  a  sphere,  a  cone,  a  cube,  a 
cylinder,  a  line  segment,  and  even  a 
torus.  It's  amazing  how  many  objects 
can  be  created  from  these  primitives, 
but  if  your  needs  are  more  complex, 
3-D  Pro  also  has  lathe,  conic,  and  pro- 
file tools  that  let  you  create  more  com- 
plex primitives.  You  can  even  create 
fractal  trees  and  landscapes  or  convert 
Amiga  fonts  or  IFF  brushes  into  3-D 
objects.  You  can  also  import  Video- 
Scape  3-D;  Sculpt  3-D,  AutoCad, 
Forms  in  Flight,  Turbo  Silver,  3-De- 
mon.  and  Atari  ST  Cad  3-D  objects. 
Your  3-D  Pro  objects  can  be  saved  in 
VideoScape  3-D  format  for  editing 
with  a  third-party  object  editor. 

The  objects  you  create  can  have  a 
wide  variety  of  characteristics.  You 
can  choose  an  object's  color,  transpar- 
ency, roughness,  reflectiveness,  glossi- 
ness, index  of  refraction,  and  amount 
of  specular  reflection.  There  are  also  a 
number  of  predefined  surface  proper- 
ties, such  as  plastic,  stone,  aluminum, 
and  glass.  The  most  impressive  effects 
can  be  created  using  the  editable  tex- 
tures. With  a  single  click,  you  wrap 
your  objects  with  wood,  marble, 
checkered  patterns,  bricks,  or  a  host  of 
other  textures. 

Once  you've  created  your  objects, 
3-D  Pro  makes  it  easy  to  arrange  them 
into  a  scene.  You  can  edit  an  object 
from  one  of  six  different  views  (left, 
right,  top,  bottom,  front,  and  back). 
Only  one  view  can  be  displayed  at  a 


time  while  editing,  but  there's  a  Mod- 
el view  that  lets  you  preview  your 
scene  from  four  different  angles. 

The  camera  view  shows  your 
scene  as  from  the  observer's  view- 
point. This  is  very  handy — most  3-D 
packages  require  you  to  render  a  test 
scene  to  see  exactly  how  your  objects 
will  be  displayed. 

Instead  of  just  displaying  a  wire- 
frame view  of  your  objects  while 
you're  editing  them,  3-D  Pro  shows 
you  a  solid,  dithered,  color  representa- 
tion of  the  scene.  This  makes  it  easy  to 
remember  which  colors  you've  chosen 
for  individual  objects  and  gives  you  a 
basic  idea  of  how  objects  will  be 
shaded. 

Once  you've  created  your  scene, 
it's  time  to  shed  some  light  on  your 
subjects.  You  can  have  up  to  99  differ- 
ent light  sources  in  a  scene.  Lights  can 
be  points  (like  a  light  bulb  or  the  sun), 
cylindrical  (like  a  laser  beam),  or  coni- 
cal (tike  a  spotlight).  Light  beams  can 
have  different  colors,  handy  for  creat- 
ing effects  like  red  laser  beams  or  pur- 
ple spotlights.  You  can  also  control 
the  amount  of  ambient  light  and  cre- 
ate haze  effects. 

Your  lights  are  in  place,  the  cam- 
era is  ready,  and  now  it's  showtime. 
Options  abound  at  rendering  time, 
loo.  There  are  four  different  rendering 
options  built  in:  pattern,  solid, 
gourad,  and  phong.  Pattern  is  similar 
to  the  shading  used  in  the  work 
modes;  the  shading  of  each  polygon  is 
achieved  by  dithering  gray  patterns 
with  the  polygons  in  each  object  to 
make  varying  shades  of  the  polygon's 
color.  Solid  rendering  uses  more  col- 
ors, but  each  face  of  the  polygon  is 
rendered  in  a  single  color.  Gourad 
employs  a  smoothing  algorithm  to  re- 
move the  faceted  look  of  each  object. 

Pattern-,  solid-,  and  gourad- 
rendering  algorithms  are  good  for 
first-draft  pictures,  but  you'll  want  to 
use  phong  shading  for  final  output. 
Phong  rendering  determines  shading 
on  a  pixel-by-pixel  basis,  so  it  shows 
all  textures  and  specular  highlights, 
and  it's  much  faster  than  ray-tracing. 
While  phong-rendered  objects  often 
look  as  good  as  their  ray-traced  coun- 
terparts, they  don't  cast  shadows,  so 
phong-rendered  pictures  generally 
aren't  as  realistic  as  ray  tracings.  To 
get  the  most  out  of  i-Z)  Pro,  you'll 
want  to  purchase  the  optional  ray- 
tracing  module,  >

DEADLIEST  VyEAPONS  NEVER

Imagine  the  shock  of  American  B-17 
pilots  when  the  first  German  jet  fighters 
whistled  past.  The  lumbering  bombers 
seemed  to  be  standing  still,  sitting  ducks  for 
radical  aircraft  years  ahead  of  their  time. 

The  twin-jet  Me  262  unleashed  a

Were  the  Allies  saved  by  Hitler's  blunder? 

As  you'll  read  in  the  224-page  histor- 
ical manual,  Hitler's  demand  for  a  blitz 
bomber  delayed  deployment  of  the  Me  262s 
as  fighters. 

In  Secret  Weapons  of  the  Luftwaffe,

com inued  from  page  100 

I  examined  an  early  beta  version 
of  the  3-D  Professional  Ray-Trace 
Custom  Rendering  Module.  This  pro- 
gram can  be  run  in  conjunction  with 
3-D  Pro  (select  Custom  Rendering 
and  3'D  Pro  will  send  the  file  to  the 
ray  tracer),  or  as  a  stand-alone  (the 
program  loads  a  3-D  Pro  data  file). 
The  module  gives  you  an  incredible 
amount  of  control  over  the  tracing 
process.  You  can  select  the  number  of 
rays  to  trace  through  each  pixel  and 
toggle  features  such  as  soft  shadows, 
fuzzy  reflections,  and  smoothing.  3-D 
Pro's  ray-tracing  module  is  the  first  to 
support  atmospheric  distortion,  so 
your  pictures  can  even  have  a  foggy  or 
hazy  appearance.  The  module  should 
be  available  sometime  late  this  fall. 

You  can  display  3-D  Pro  render- 
ing on  a  wide  variety  of  devices.  Of 
course,  3-D  Pro  will  render  directly  to 
the  Amiga  monitor  in  lo  res,  hi  res,  or 
HAM.  You  can  output  24-bit  RAW 
RGB  files,  so  you  can  modify  your 
renderings  with  programs  such  as 
ASDG's  The  An  Department.  The 
program  also  supports  the  2024  and 
Moniterm  1008  X  800  monochrome 
monitors,  the  Mimetics  Frame  Buffer, 
and  the  MicroIIlusions  Transport 
Controller.  You  can  even  output  to  a 
PostScript  or  EPS  file  if  you're  plan- 
ning on  using  your  creation  in  a  laser- 
printed  document. 

3-D  Pro  isn't  limited  to  just  creat- 
ing pretty  pictures,  either.  You  can 
create  animations  using  scripts  or  the 
menu  interface,  ARexx  scripts  can  be 
used  to  set  up  each  frame  in  the  ani- 
mation, or  you  can  use  the  key-frame 
feature  to  set  up  starting  and  ending 
frames  and  let  3-D  Pro  handle  the 
movements  necessary  to  get  objects 
from  Point  A  to  Point  B.  You  can 
tune  up  your  animations  using  the  in- 
cluded Animation  Station  software,  a 
powerful  frame-by-frame  animation 
editor  that's  also  available  separately 
from  PP  &  S. 

The  program  comes  in  a  huge 
box  that's  packed  with  documenta- 
tion. There's  a  310-page  tutorial  man- 
ual, a  450-page  reference  manual,  and 
another  100-page  manual  covering  the 
Animation  Station  software.  There's 
even  a  two-hour  tutorial  videotape  in- 
cluded in  the  package.  The  manuals 
are  well  written  and  logically 
organized. 

I  have  only  a  few  complaints 


about  3-D  Pro.  When  you  first  start 
the  program,  you're  faced  with  a  re- 
quester asking  how  many  objects, 
primitives,  vertices,  and  other  ele- 
ments you'll  need  for  your  scene. 
While  you  can  usually  just  accept  the 
default  values,  the  requester  is  an  in- 
timidating element  in  a  program 
that's  otherwise  very  friendly  to  nov- 
ices. Also,  the  program  is  slow  on 
68000  machines.  Using  the  sample 
scene  file,  it  took  the  program  1 3  sec- 
onds to  redraw  the  screen  after  I 
moved  a  single  object.  On  a  25-MHz 
3000  using  the  supplied  68020/68881 
version,  the  same  scene  was  redrawn 
in  only  3.5  seconds.  Finally,  because 
of  the  $499.95  retail  price  of  3-D  Pro- 
fessional, PP  &  S  should  charge  only  a 
nominal  fee  for  the  ray-tracing  mod- 
ule, considering  that  it  should  have 
been  included  with  the  package  in  the 
first  place.

BARNEY  BEAR 
GBES  TO  TRE  FARM 

Barney  Bear  is  back.  In  Barney 
Bear  Goes  to  the  Farm,  the  sec- 
ond entry  in  this  series  for  young 
children,  Barney  visits  his  grand- 
parents' farm.  This  interactive  tale  in- 
cludes short  stories,  games,  and  even  a 
computerized  coloring  book. 

Barney  starts  by  performing  his 
chores,  such  as  milking  cows  and 
feeding  chickens.  Each  chore  is  depict- 
ed in  a  still  picture.  Click  on  an  object 
and  you'll  hear  a  sound  or  a  voice  tell- 
ing you  something  about  the  object. 
He  then  heads  to  the  farmhouse. 


where  he  sits  by  the  fire,  reading  sto- 
ries and  playing  games.  There  are  ten 
different  activities  in  the  program. 
Healthy  Bears  teaches  children  about 
how  to  be  health  conscious.  The  Seed 
tells  how  a  seed  is  planted  and  grows. 
In  the  I  Can  Read  activity,  the  pro- 
gram displays  pictures  often  farm  ani- 
mals. When  the  child  clicks  on  each 
animal,  the  animal  makes  a  sound, 
and  the  program  uses  the  Amiga's 
voice  synthesizer  to  tell  a  story  about 
the  animal. 

In  the  What  Belongs  to  Me? 
game,  a  child  must  match  one  of  five 
objects  to  an  appropriate  animal.  The 
most  entertaining  game  is  the  Silly 
Scarecrow  Game,  where  you  initially 
see  a  scarecrow  in  a  field.  By  clicking 
on  various  arrows,  you  can  change  the 
head,  body,  and  legs  to  form  different, 
and  often  silly-looking,  scarecrows. 
Finally,  the  program  contains  a  color- 
ing book  with  1 2  black-and-white  pic- 
tures for  children  lo  paint. 

While  the  program  appears  rela- 
tively simple  and  basic  to  an  adult, 
children  enjoy  it  immensely.  The 
Amiga's  internal  voice  synthesizer,  ig- 
nored in  most  programs,  is  used  ex- 
tensively, and  ray  play  testers 
accepted  the  somewhat  stilted  voice 
surprisingly  well. 

While  Barney  Bear  Goes  to  the 
Farm  is  geared  for  the  three-  to  eight- 
year-old  age  group,  children  over  six 
may  find  the  program  uninteresting. 
The  graphics  and  sounds  are  good, 
and  children  can  get  through  most  of 
the  activities  without  having  to  read. 
The  only  negative  aspect  is  the  lack  of 
animated  sequences,  which  would 
make  the  program  more  interesting 
and  exciting  to  kids.  The  program  is  a 
success,  though,  according  to  my  six- 
year-old,  who  thoroughly  enjoys  the 
program.

PR0WRITE3.1 

Highly  intuitive  and  designed  spe- 
cifically for  the  Amiga,  ProWrite 
3. 1  is  an  extremely  powerful  yet 
deceptively  simple-to-use  graphic 
word  processor.  Using  ProWrite's 
pull-down  menus  and  keyboard  short- 
cuts, it  took  my  ten-year-old  son  only 
1 5  minutes  to  learn  to  use  the 
program. 

Text  editing  is  beautifiilly  imple- 
mented and  very  fast.  The  four  main 
commands  are  under  the  left  hand: 
Amiga-V  to  paste,  C  to  Copy,  X  to 
cut,  and  Z  for  the  new  Undo  function, 
which  has  become  one  of  my  favor- 
ites. You  can  undo  all  editing  and  for- 
matting commands,  alignment 
changes,  picture  moves,  ruler  changes, 
and  other  actions.  You  can  even 
change  your  mind  and  undo  the  Undo 
command.  You  can  also  edit  headers 
and  footers,  include  automatic  dates 
and  page  numbering,  and  use  sub- 
scripts and  superscripts. 

If  you  like  a  clean  writing  screen, 
you  can  toggle  the  ruler  away.  The 
screen  isn't  cluttered  with  gadgets,  so 
you  can  see  more  of  your  text.  You 
can  have  up  to  ten  windows  open  at 
once,  containing  pictures  and  text, 
with  multiple  colors  and  fonts.  The 
WYSIWYG  display  takes  all  the 
guesswork  out  of  formatting  and 
printing. 

The  100,000-word  spelling  check- 
er lets  you  check  a  range  of  text,  look 
up  a  single  word,  check  continuously, 
and  add  words  to  the  user  dictionary. 
The  300,000-word  cross-reference  the- 
saurus allows  you  to  move  back  and 
forth  through  several  hierarchies  of 
words. 

ProWrite  3.1  has  many  powerful 
new  features  including  both  news- 
paper-style and  snaking  columns, 
ARexx  macros,  and  a  special  story- 
boarding  feature.  Pro  Write  will  auto- 
matically open  its  screen  in  the  same 
resolution  as  your  Workbench  screen, 
or  you  can  fo'rce  it  to  use  almost  any 
other  screen  mode,  including  the  new 
ECS  Productivity  and  SuperHires 
modes. 

Version  3.1  includes  an  im- 
proved file  requester  that's  still  easy 
for  novices  to  use  but  that  now  lets 
you  type  filenames  and  paths  directly

into  a  text  box,  move  forward  or  back- 
ward between  disk  directories,  and  se- 
lect a  path  from  a  list  of  disks  and 
system  assignments.  It  also  adds  an 
adjustable  Speak  command  that  will 
read  a  marked  block  of  text  back  to 
you.  The  improved  font  requester 
shows  you  a  sample  of  the  font  you've 
chosen  and  lets  you  install  your  favor- 
ite fonts  in  a  quick-access  submenu. 

ProWrite  has  many  user-definable 
parameters  that  can  be  changed  by  the 
user  and  saved  as  defaults.  In  fact, 
everything  in  your  document  setup 
that  can  be  changed  is  now  saved  in 
your  Prefs  file.  This  welcome  new  fea- 
ture makes  starting  writing  sessions  a 
breeze. 

Print  options  abound,  including 
smoothing  and  print  reduction  for 
high-quality  output  on  a  dot-matrix 
printer.  You  can  also  print  back-to- 
front,  odd-even,  or  collated.  ProWrite 
will  print  using  Amiga  bitmap  fonts  or 
native  printer  fonts.  You  can  even 
mix  graphics  with  your  printer's  built- 
in  letter-quality  fonts.  If  you  have  a 
color  printer,  you'll  be  especially 
pleased  with  ProWriie's  excellent 
dithered  color  graphic  output. 

The  ProWrite  manual  is  easy  to 
use,  with  sections  for  quick  reference 
and  a  good  index.  You  probably  won't 
need  the  manual  much  at  all,  but  I 
recommend  browsing  through  it  to 
find  all  the  nice  little  extra  touches 
this  program  has,  such  as  several  edit- 
ing shortcuts. 

New  Horizons  deserves  top 
marks  for  its  Bug-Free  Guarantee.  If 
you  find  a  bug  in  the  program,  the 
company  will  fix  it  free  within  30  days 
or  you  can  return  the  program,  Pro- 
Write's  flexibility  and  speed,  along 
with  its  great  range  of  options,  make  it 
an  excellent  value.

SECRET 
SILVER  R 


OETHE 


SSI  perfected  its  AD  &  D  (Ad- 
vanced Dungeons  &  Dragons) 
game  system  with  the  release  of 
Champions  ofKrymn.  The  first 
two  games  in  the  series.  Pool  of  Radi- 
ance and  Curse  of  the  Azure  Bonds, 
were  too  difficult  to  play  because  of 
the  combat  system  and  vast  numbers 
of  monsters  the  games  threw  at  you. 

Champions  ofKrymn  revamped 
the  game  system  to  make  the  adven- 
ture easier  to  play.  The  result  was  ex- 
actly what  gamers  were  looking  for. 
This  game  system  has  been  trans- 
ferred to  Secret  of  the  Silver  Blades, 
the  newest  role-playing  epic  in  SSI's 
AD  &  D  line. 

.'\  long  time  ago,  two  brothers 
named  Eldamar  and  Oswulf  lived  in 
the  town  of  Verdigris.  Eldamar  suc- 
cumbed to  the  dark  side  of  human  na- 
ture and  practiced  evil  studies.  Oswulf 
condemned  his  brother's  practices 
and  managed  to  overpower  him  and 
his  minions.  Oswulf  refused  to  kill  his 
brother;  instead  he  encased  Verdigris 
and  the  evil  ones  in  a  glacier.  In  recent 
days,  however,  the  glacier  receded  and 
miners  began  reworking  the  mines. 
They've  renamed  the  town  New  Ver- 
digris and  turned  it  into  a  thriving 
business. 

Recently,  evil  members  of  the 
community,  known  as  the  Black  Cir- 
cle, suggested  that  the  miners  dig 
deeper  for  even  greater  riches.  Unfor- 
tunately, the  miners  opened  a  passage 
that  released  the  monsters  from  the 
glacier.  The  town  was  ravaged.  The 
citizens  took  all  of  their  wealth  and 
threw  it  into  the  Well  of  Knowledge, 
hoping  for  a  savior.  Your  party  in 
Secret  is  charged  with  ridding  New 
Verdigris  of  its  evil  threat. 

The  Silver  Blades  of  the  title  was 
the  name  of  Oswulf  s  group  that  de- 
feated his  brother.  Your  party  must 
become  like  the  Silver  Blades  of  old.  It 
isn't  hard  to  ease  into  this  role  be- 
cause of  Secret's  game  system.  Most 
commands  are  entered  using  menus 
and  lists.  Movement  in  exploration 


and  combat  is  controlled  using  the 
joystick.  Together,  the  joystick  and 
keyboard  effectively  control  the  game. 
You  will  be  up  and  running  with  Se- 
cret in  15-20  minutes.  Most  com- 
mands are  intuitive,  and  those  that 
aren't  are  explained  very  well  in  the 
manual.  The  system  adheres  closely  to 
the  rules  for  the  AD  &  D  board  game 
and  is  approved  by  TSR,  creator  of 
AD&D. 

As  with  other  AD  &.  D  games,  the 
graphics  are  highly  detailed  and  color- 
ful. The  fluidity  of  movement  is  re- 
flected in  the  views  from  which  you 
see  the  Secret  game  world.  You  see 
mazes,  dungeons  and  such  in  3-D, 
while  general  areas,  outdoor  travels, 
and  combat  are  seen  from  an  over- 
head persfKctive.  The  characters  and 
monsters  are  depicted  in  great  detail 
in  all  views.  It's  almost  as  much  fun  to 
watch  Secret  as  it  is  to  play  it.  The 
AD  &  D  games  from  SSI  are  the  type 
that  you  might  record  with  a  VCR 
and  show  as  background  video  for 
parties  and  gatherings.  Graphics  are 
captivating  and  pull  you  into  the  sto- 
ry. Full-screen  pictures  and  in-be- 
tween scenes  accentuate  normal  play. 
Secret  boasts  of  having  the  largest  3-D 
terrain  of  any  of  the  AD  &  D  games. 
You'd  better  believe  it! 

Once  again,  SSI  has  proved  why 
its  game  manuals  are  considered  the 
finest  in  the  industry.  In  addition  to 
the  data  card  that  explains  how  to  use 
Secret  on  your  particular  computer, 
SSI  packages  a  rule  book  and  an  ad- 
venturer's journal.  Both  booklets  are 
easy  to  read  and  include  illustrations 
or  screen  shots  where  necessary. 
These  manuals  are  organized  very 
well  and  also  act  as  copy  protection. 
The  game  refers  directly  to  entries 
made  in  the  Adventurer's  Journal,  and 
these  add  to  the  atmosphere  and  mys- 
tery of  Secret.  I  have  always  found 
this  technique  effective  in  keeping  the 
game  fresh  and  not  requiring  the 
gamer  to  stare  at  a  screen  for  hours 
without  an  occasional  diversion. 

Although  it  isn't  needed  to  finish 
the  game,  I  strongly  recommend  buy- 
ing the  clue  book  for  Secret.  It  offers 
all  of  the  hints  you  need  to  finish  the 
game:  maps,  monster  weaknesses,  and 
important  game  events.  It  was  indis- 
pensable for  my  getting  a  good  dis- 
tance into  the  game  to  do  this  review; 
it  was  much  quicker  than  relying  on

my  wits  alone.  It  adds  the  final  touch  to  a  complete  game 

experience  that  will  wrap  you  up  for  weeks  on  end. 

Once  again,  SSF  has  proved  why  it  is  a  consistent 
leader  in  the  role-playing  game  genre.  Instead  of  just  offer- 
ing the  same  rehashed  AD  &  D  gold-box  game  in  a  differ- 
ent environment,  SSI  has  added  new  things  to  keep 
gamers  happy.  New  monsters  and  spells  and  higher  char- 
acter classes  are  part  of  the  refinement.  The  best  new  fea- 
ture is  the  combat  LEVEL  command  that  allows  you  to 
make  combat  easier  or  harder.  The  down  side  of  this  fea- 
ture is  that  experience  points  are  scaled  to  reflect  the  diffi- 
culty. This  feature  should  make  Secret  accessible  to  newer 
players  as  well  as  offering  a  stronger  challenge  to  veterans. 

Secret  is  the  finest  gold-box  AD  c&  D  game  from  SSI 
to  date.  I  think  SSI  should  wait  awhile  before  releasing  an- 
other game  in  this-series.  Champions  ofKrynn  was  set  in 
the  Dragonlance  world.  Without  changing  the  interface, 
SSI  should  come  up  with  a  game  that  has  a  lot  of  new  fea- 
tures to  make  it  more  attractive  to  gamers  who  have  al- 
ready played  one  of  the  gold-box  games. 

Until  then,  pick  up  Secret  of  the  Silver  Blades  if  you're 
between  games.  I  was  considerably  impressed  and  look 
forward  to  future  products.  Happy  adventuring!

F-16  COMBAT  PILOT 

Iet's  imagine  for  a  moment  that  you  have  been  selected 
as  one  of  the  USAFs  elite  who  will  pilot  a  General  Dy- 
namics F-16  Falcon  Fighter.  This  complex  military  air- 
craft is  not  Ukely  to  be  entrusted  to  just  anyone. 

Players  must  log  multiple  joystick  hours  before  they 
can  effectively  soar  into  the  fray  of  battle  in  F-16  Combat 
Pilot,  a  fighter  jet  simulation  by  Digital  Integration.  This 
simulation  covers  the  entire  gamut  of  fighter  combat. 

Flying  five  different  missions  with  the  code  names 
HAMMERBLOW,  DEEPSTRIKE,  WATCHTOWER, 
SCRAMBLE,  and  T.A.NKBUSTERS,  pilots  put  their  F- 
1 6s  through  ever>'  conceivable  combat  scenario:  air-to-air 
bogey  interceptions,  battlefield  close-air  support,  recon- 
naissance missions,  and  the  destruction  of  enemy  supplies 
and  military  targets.  Mastering  these  missions  is  manda- 
tory and  absolutely  necessary  to  prepare  a  pilot  for  the 
sixth  and  most  challenging  multimission  campaign:  OP- 
ERATION CONQUEST. 

Just  as  every  aspiring  pilot  knows,  complete  study  of 
the  supplied  manual  and  all  related  documentation  is  re- 
quired to  completely  understand  your  airship  and  its  ca- 
pabilities. Even  experienced  pilots  may  find  this  a  wise 
first  step  before  sending  the  F-16  skyward.  The  creators  of 
this  simulation  have  spent  nine  man-years  in  research  and 
development  to  make  F-16  Combat  Pilot  as  real  as  possible. 

Outfitting  the  F-1 6's  nine  hardpoints  with  weapons  is 
a  decision  you  can  oversee  yourself  or  you  can  depend  on 
your  ground  crew  to  make  the  right  choices  for  you.  Care 
must  be  taken  not  to  overload  the  aircraft. 

Mastery  of  the  F-1 6's  seven  weapons  systems  and  two 
radar  modes  will  ensure  the  pilot  better  odds  in  each  of 
the  five  missions.  Tactical  Air  Command  (TAC)  monitors 
your  success  and  ranks  you  accordingly.  A  Pilot's  Log 
(save  disk)  may  be  maintained  since  completion  of  all  five 
missions  is  quite  a  lengthy  process.  Once  TAC  is  satisfied 
with  your  accomplishments,  you  are  promoted  to  Squad- 
ron Leader  and  allowed  to  plan  and  lead  multiple  aircraft 
against  the  enemy  in  OPERATION  CONQUEST. 

A  word  of  caution  to  all  hotdoggers.  F-16  Combat  Pi- 
lot is  not  an  arcade  style  shoot-'em-up.  It  is  a  complex  and 
very  realistic  simulation  that  requires  study  and  dedica- 
tion. It's  tough.  However,  the  satisfaction  of  directing  such 
a  highly  technical  piece  of  battle  hardware,  almost  as  an 
extension  of  one's  self  is  nothing  short  of  magical.

ALARMING  EVENTS 

If  your  calendar  could  just  nudge  you  a  few  minutes 
before  an  important  meeting,  yoU  might  get  to  more  of 
your  appointments  on  time.  Coming  to  the  rescue,  CE 
Software  has  grafted  a  couple  of  elbows  onto  a  new  elec- 
tronic calendar  called  Alarming  Events. 

Alarming  Events  stores  the  critical  data  from  your  ap- 
pointments and  uses  that  information  to  remind  you  of 
your  appointments  before  you  have  a  chance  to  be  iate. 

To  help  keep  you  on  lime,  the  program's  designers  or- 
ganized Alarming  Events  around  three  calendar  views — 
monthly,  weekly,  and  daily.  The  monthly  and  weekly  cal- 
endars simply  display  information.  The  monthly  calendar 
shows  as  many  months  at  a  time  as  you  want.  The  pro- 
gram  highlights  dates  on  which  you  have  appointments. 
Of  course,  this  highlighting  becomes  almost  meaningless 
when  you  have  appointments  every  day.  The  weekly  cal- 
endar shows  five  days  at  a  time  and  lists  your  appoint- 
ments for  each  day.  Clicking  on  a  date  in  the  monthly 
calendar  or  an  event  in  the  weekly  calendar  brings  up  the 
daily  calendar. 

The  daily  calendar  is  the  central  feature  of  Alarming 
Events.  On  this  screen,  you  enter  your  appointments,  set 
up  the  kind  of  alarm  you  want,  and  choose  a  time  to  be  re- 


REVIEWS 


minded  of  your  meetings.  You  can  also  set  up  recurring 
events  so  a  regular  appointment  will  transfer  from  week  to 
week,  month  to  month,  or  even  every  other  week  on  your 
calendar. 

Although  the  daily  calendar  holds  a  lot  of  infor- 
mation, the  screen  is  laid  out  clearly.  When  you  first  open 
a  daily  calendar,  you  start  by  typing  a  new  event  into  the 
Event  Subject  field.  Tab  to  the  Event  Notes  field  and  add 
as  many  lines  of  detailed  information  as  you'd  like  for 
each  event. 

At  the  top  of  the  screen,  you  can  click  on  the  clock  to 
set  the  time  for  your  appointment.  It  refers  to  your  system 
clock  to  tell  when  it  should  notify  you  of  an  appointment. 
To  the  right  of  the  text  fields,  you'll  find  boxes  in  which 
you  can  enter  the  event's  duration,  when  you  want  to  be 
reminded  of  the  event,  and  how  often  the  event  recurs. 
Each  of  these  fields  is  easy  to  set:  You  type  a  number  and 
then  choose  the  unit  of  time  from  drop-down  menus  be- 
side the  field. 

Alarming  Events  works  well  for  simple  scheduling, 
but  you  shouldn't  limit  this  program  to  storing  infor- 
mation about  appointments  and  meetings.  You  can  use 
Alarming  Events  to  plan  projects,  too.  For  example,  it  will 
notify  you  on  the  day  that  you  need  to  call  your  writers  to 
remind  them  of  their  deadlines.  It  will  remind  you  that  to- 
morrow is  the  last  day  you  can  submit  a  bid  to  your 
newest  client.  If  you  list  phone  calls  you  need  to  make, 
you  can  include  the  phone  number  in  the  description  of 
the  event.  Then,  when  the  notification  screen  pops  up,  the 
phone  number  pops  up,  too. 

In  addition  to  its  fine  calendars.  Alarming  Events  of- 
fers little  touches  that  make  the  final  package  shine.  Menu 
items  let  you  customize  the  program,  save  event  infor- 
mation in  text  files,  and  switch  to  other  Alarming  Events 
files.  You  can  even  import  and  export  calendar  files. 

In  spite  of  all  its  good  features.  Alarming  Events  still 
leaves  room  for  improvement.  For  example,  viewing  the 
notes  for  an  event  is  too  troublesome.  Once  you've  clicked 
on  an  event — even  if  it's  just  to  review  your  notes — you 
can't  click  on  OK  or  Cancel  until  you've  made  some 
change  on  the  screen.  This  means  you  must  do  something 
trivial,  like  insert  a  space  and  then  delete  it,  in  order  to 
move  on  to  the  next  event  you  want  to  review. 

None  of  the  program's  weaknesses  should  lead  you 
away  from  Alarming  Events,  though.  It's  very  useful' for  all 
kinds  of  scheduling  tasks.  CE  Software's  latest  entry  works 
just  like  a  trusted  assistant,  nudging  you  in  plenty  of  time 
to  make  that  important  appointment.

excellent  3-D  bitmap  graphics  and  digitized  sounds  make

Turbo  Mouse  ADB  3.0  Ten  percent  of  Mac  owners  use  a  trackball.  If  you're  one 
of  the  90  percent  who  don't,  take  a  look  at  Kensington's 
top-selling  Turtx)  Mouse  ADB.  It  offers  200  CPi  precision, 
can  be  switched  for  left-  and  right-handed  users,  and  auto- 
matically moves  the  cursor  farther  when  you  move  the 
trackball  faster.  Because  it  has  a  second  ADB  port,  you 
can  stm  use  your  mouse  for  those  programs  that  work  [set- 
ter with  a  mouse.  Highly  recommended.         David  English

House  of  Cards

This  collection  of  popular  card  games  will  fill  an  idle  after- 
noon. It  features  spades,  cribbage,  hearts,  pinochle, 
bridge,  and  gin  rummy,  all  in  two-player  format  (you 
against  the  computer).  Because  of  the  twitchy  mouse 
interface,  the  keyboard  option  is  recommended.  The 
graphics  and  sound  are  not  spectacular,  but  in  card 
games  strategy  is  the  important  thing.  Watch  out  for  the 
computer — it  sandbags.  Robert  Bixby

Redline's  sole  purpose  is  to  turn  the  cursor  into  a  solid 
highlight  that  stretches  across  the  entire  screen.  Originally 
designed  for  spreadsheet  users,  it's  less  successful  in  the 
general  marketplace  because  many  packages  bypass  the 
hardware  cursor  and  create  their  own,  thus  defeating  Red- 
line.  It  worked  well  with  spreadsheets,  but  not  with  PC 
Tools  or  Microsoft  Word.  Make  sure  it  will  work  with  your 
favorite  package.  Tom  Campbell

ft  goe<>  without  saying  that  a  good 
simulator  recreates,  in  perfect  det; 
elements  that  make  an  aircraft  wJ 
—  elements  such  as  flight  chara 
weaponry,  and  the  ability  to  sus 
damage.  Ta  do  less  would  be  an  affront  t 
.simulation  purists  everywhere. 

Rt'il  Baron  takes  the  experience  <me  step 
further  by  recreating  not  only  the  obvious 
details,  but  Ihe/Zfvtvjrof  the  time.  I'he 
humanity,  the  romance,  the  emotion  that 
once  filled  the  hearts  of  "?/ifj,vf  ilarina 
youii;^  mm  in  tht-if  jlyiu^  marhinvs."  It  lakes 
you  backward  in  lime  to  an  age  when 
aviation  was  in  its  infancy,  and  young 
pilots  such  as  Kddie  Ric  ken  backer,  Hilly 
liishop  and  Manfred  von  Kichthofen  took 
to  the  air  and  invented  the  skills  that 
would  keep  them  alive.  A  time  when 
tighter  pilots  of  all  nations  formed  a 
brotherhood  that  transcended  allegiance. 
These  men  were  the  last  true  heroes  —  the 
legendary  Aces. 

Red  Baron  is  more  than  a  good  flight 
simulator.  It's  an  opportunity  for  you  (o 
discover  what  it  was  really  like  tit  be  a 
fighting  Ace  in  the  war  thai  launched
