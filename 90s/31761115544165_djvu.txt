Foreword 


This report to the Speaker of the House of Commons, 
following the March 30, 1998 by-election in the 
electoral district of Port Moody—Coquitlam, in 

British Columbia, provides details of that by-election, 
and of Elections Canada’s activities since the statutory 
report on the June 2, 1997 general election. It also 
enables me to provide readers with a glimpse of our 
future challenges. 

As I indicated in my last report, the June 1997 
election was truly a departure for Canadians, not least 
because it featured, in close succession, the last 
national enumeration for a federal election and the 
establishment and first use of the National Register 
of Electors. Among other changes, it marked the 
inauguration of the 36-day election calendar. 

We at Elections Canada have spent considerable 
time over the past year assessing what worked well in 


that election and where improvements could be made. 


The details of this process are found in the pages of 
this report. I am particularly pleased with the way 
Elections Canada is using new developments in 
technology to automate and streamline practices 
and processes that help to maintain a constant state 
of election readiness. 

We continue to see progress in the maintenance 
of the National Register of Electors. Through 
agreements reached with Revenue Canada and 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada, as well as 
with the provinces and territories, we have access to 
up-to-date and accurate data on electors as they move, 
reach voting age, become Canadian citizens, or die. 
The National Register of Electors is increasingly 
becoming a resource, not only for federal elections, 
but also for provincial and municipal elections. 

We have already entered into several partnership 
agreements to share data for this purpose, and 

I continue to place a high priority on our work with 
other levels of government to further develop these 
partnerships, given the very significant advantages 
such partnerships can bring to Canadian electors. 


Looking to the future, Elections Canada is 
exploring ways to make it easier for all Canadians to 
cast their ballots. New developments in technology, 
in particular the World Wide Web, have enabled us 
to provide a wide range of information to electors. 
We are now considering whether and how technology 
can be applied to the act of casting a ballot. We 
recently commissioned a study to examine what 
types of technology exist, and how these can be 
adapted for federal elections, as well as what other 
countries are doing to bring their voting systems into 
the electronic age. 

Our responsibility is to understand the full range 
of options, with all the attendant advantages and 
disadvantages each would bring, so that we can 
provide the best possible advice to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which is 
responsible for reviewing and reporting on all matters 
relating to the election of members of Parliament. 
Throughout, our emphasis has to be on protecting the 
main tenets of the democratic system while attempting 
to ensure increased accessibility to the process for 
all Canadians. 

We recognize that, as with the National 
Register of Electors when it was first considered, 
the introduction of electronic voting could raise a 
number of concerns for many Canadians, particularly 
related to privacy and security. We will recommend 
that Parliament proceed with such a radical change 
to the way Canadians cast their votes only after we 
have paid full attention to these concerns and with 
due regard to all of the other principles inherent in 
our current process. As part of our study of electronic 
voting, we worked with the Public Policy Forum to 
hold round-table discussions with key stakeholders, 
in part to identify these concerns. A common 
thread throughout, and one to which we will 
attach great importance, was the very clear desire, 
on the part of the electorate, to see changes in 
voting methods introduced as a supplement 


to, rather than a replacement of, traditional 
methods. 

Considering the implications of the possible 
introduction of a system of electronic voting will form 
part of Elections Canada’s second strategic planning 
exercise. Our first strategic plan was developed and 
published in 1994. As we come to the end of its 
intended life span, I am pleased to note that we have 
achieved what we set out to accomplish. The plan was 
absolutely essential to our being able to plot the 
course that would best enable us to carry out our 
statutory obligations, and provided us with a sense 
of direction for the changes that were required. 

Among the challenges we have to consider in 
developing our second strategic plan is maximizing 


the opportunities for sharing the National Register 
of Electors, so that Canadian electors can enjoy the 
advantages of sharing the system, while respecting the 
confidentiality of Register information and restricting 
its use to electoral purposes only. Further, we must 
ensure that returning officers have the knowledge 
and training they need to operate in an increasingly 
automated environment. Above all, we must maintain 
a sense of direction so that we can determine and 
shape the changes that we will be faced with, rather 
than simply reacting to them. 

As we prepare to enter the new millennium, 
I remain confident that Canada’s electoral system is 
one of the finest in the world, and that it continues 
to protect and extend our democratic heritage. 


Jean-Pierre Kingsley 


From there to here: Elections Canada, 
June 2, 1997 — March 30, 1998 


Closing the books on the 
36th general election 


Evaluating the election 


One of the most important activities following a 
general election is the process of examining how 

the election was conducted, in order to improve the 
administration of future electoral events. Such a 
process was particularly important following the 

36th general election, as it was the first ever national 
electoral event to use a preliminary list of electors 
generated from the National Register of Electors and 
to be conducted in a 36-day period. 

As happens after every general election, a 
representative group of returning officers, assistant 
returning officers, automation co-ordinators, and 
others involved in the electoral process were brought 
together by Elections Canada to identify issues and 
problems faced during the election and to identify 
possible solutions and strategies for future electoral 
events. As well, more than 100 Elections Canada staff 
participated in an internal post-mortem process, the 
most exhaustive Elections Canada has undertaken 
following a general election. 

The post-mortem process did reveal 
shortcomings, most of them related to the need to 
have systems operational within a very short time 
frame, and it resulted in several suggestions for 
improvements. They will be analyzed over the coming 
months, coincident with Elections Canada’s second 
strategic planning exercise. Together, they will lay the 
groundwork for improvements to Elections Canada’s 
procedures and processes before the next major 
electoral event. 


Review of candidates’ and 
political parties’ returns 
and reimbursements 


Elections Canada has also audited the candidates’ 
financial returns for the 1672 candidates who ran for 


office in the general election to ensure compliance 
with the Canada Elections Act and to determine the 
amount of reimbursement owed to those who qualify. 
Candidates are required to file election expenses 
returns within four months of election day. 
Reimbursements of election expenses for registered 
political parties that qualified were issued. Registered 
political parties are required to fill their election 
expenses returns within six months of election day. 


Publishing election reports 


Over the coming months, Elections Canada will 
publish the campaign contributions and expenses of 
registered political parties and candidates. It has 
already published Official Voting Results and Report of 
the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada on the 36th General 
Election. Reflecting the transition from print to 
electronic communication where feasible, Elections 
Canada for the first time has published the official 
voting results on CD-ROM as well as in print form and 
on diskette. 


Complaints of alleged offences 
under the Act 


A total of 290 complaints related to the 36th general 
election alleging an offence to the Canada Elections Act 
have been brought to the attention of the 
Commissioner of Canada Elections, of which 223 were 
closed by March 30, 1998. These data do not take into 
account all the complaints that may be related to 
election financing. Written complaints must be 
submitted within six months of the date of the alleged 
offence; where the evidence is sufficient, and an 
intervention would be in the public interest, 
prosecution must commence within 18 months from 
the date the offence was allegedly committed. 


Elector registration 


The 1997 general election marked the first use of 
the National Register of Electors. Since that time, 


Elections Canada has been updating each of the 
301 databases that make up the Register (one for each 
electoral district). 

On October 15, 1997, each member of 
Parliament was sent a list of electors, generated from 
the National Register of Electors, for his or her 
electoral district. Each registered political party that 
presented a candidate in that electoral district could 
also request a copy of the list. This distribution will 
occur each year, as required by the Canada Elections 
Act, and will include all revisions to the Register since 
the previous October. 


The National Register of Electors 


The Register is maintained on a regular basis, so that a 
preliminary list of electors can be generated whenever 
an electoral event is called. Elections Canada has 
concluded agreements to obtain data for the ongoing 
maintenance of the Register from the Permanent List 
of Electors in Quebec, and from the majority of 
provincial and territorial registrars of motor vehicles 
and registrars of vital statistics. Negotiations are 
ongoing with motor vehicle registries in Manitoba 
and the Yukon and with Alberta Registries for the 
provision of both motor vehicle and vital statistics 
information. Government officials have confirmed 
their intention to conclude these agreements in late 
spring 1998. As well, an agreement has been 
concluded with the Office of the Chief Electoral 
Officer in British Columbia to obtain data from its 
permanent list of electors. 

Similar agreements have been reached with 
the two federal data suppliers (Revenue Canada and 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada). As part of the 
agreement with Revenue Canada, income tax returns 
now include a consent box to allow taxfilers to 
authorize Revenue Canada to forward their names, 
addresses, and dates of birth to Elections Canada for 
updating their existing listing in the National Register 
of Electors. Because the National Register of Electors 
is still new to many Canadians, Elections Canada has 
established a temporary unit in its Enquiry Centre to 
deal with Register-related requests. The unit received 
9 604 calls between January and April 1998 alone. 


As well, Citizenship and Immigration Canada has 
modified the Application for Canadian Citizenship 
form to include a consent box to allow prospective 
citizens to indicate their authorization for Elections 
Canada to add their names to the Register once 
citizenship is granted. 

While the Register is designed to be updated 
from existing administrative data, minimizing elector 
responsibility for keeping listings up-to-date, electors 
can also submit registrations, corrections, and opt-out 
requests. Elections Canada has received and processed 
approximately 1000 such transactions since June 1997. 


Partnerships and 
sharing agreements 


The National Register of Electors constitutes a 
valuable resource not only for federal electoral 

events, but for elections in all jurisdictions. Since 

its inception, in April 1997, Elections Canada 

has received 57 requests for Register data from 

48 jurisdictions at the provincial, territorial, and 
municipal levels. In addition, in the fall of 1997, the 
first partnership agreement was concluded with the 
City of Winnipeg to exchange electoral data in 
connection with the city’s fall 1998 municipal election. 
By using data from the National Register of Electors, 
the City of Winnipeg will save approximately $600 000 
by eliminating its door-to-door enumeration. Another 
such agreement was concluded with the province of 
New Brunswick in March 1998, to provide elector data 
for use in its May 1998 municipal elections. 

The Chief Electoral Officer continues to work 
with his provincial and territorial counterparts, 
through a federal-provincial working group, to 
encourage further data sharing. 


Amendments to legislation 


Now that the National Register of Electors has been 
established and is being regularly maintained, an 
enumeration is no longer necessary as part of each 
federal electoral event. As provided for in subsection 
94(3) of An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act, 

the Parliament of Canada Act and the Referendum Act 
(S.C. 1996, c. 35), the sections of the Canada Elections 


Act regarding enumeration (sections 63-71 and 
71.001-71.003) were therefore repealed as of 
December 1, 1997. On December 19, 1997, the 
Chief Electoral Officer adapted these amendments 
for the purpose of referendums. 


Public outreach 


During and between electoral events, Elections 
Canada runs programs to better inform Canadians 
about the electoral process and their democratic rights. 
In keeping with the increasingly electronic 
world in which we live, Elections Canada’s Web site 
continues to develop as a resource for information, 
not only about specific electoral events, but about 
elections and democracy in Canada. Elections Canada 
reports are made available on the Web site, which is 
updated regularly. E-mail from the Web site also 
provides a convenient means of communication 
between electors and Elections Canada. In addition, 
the agency operates a toll-free telephone enquiry 
line for the public, which is available in Canada, 
the United States and, since early 1998, Mexico 
(1 800 INFO-VOTE). 


Reaching out to students 


Elections Canada is also reaching out to future 
electors, with the recent launch of “Choosing Our 
Mascot.” This election simulation kit is designed to 
teach children in kindergarten to Grade 4 how 
elections work by having them choose a classroom 
mascot from four animal candidates, all native to the 
Northwest Territories. The kit was launched at 
Nakasuk School in Iqaluit, Northwest Territories, on 
November 13, 1997, where more than 300 students 
elected Neevee the Caribou as their mascot. The kit, 
which was developed in partnership with Elections 
Northwest Territories, is available to all schools 
across Canada. 

Older students will enjoy Exploring Canada’s 
Electoral System, an interactive CD-ROM developed by 
Elections Canada. This dynamic multi-media program 
allows students aged 13-24 to explore different aspects 
of the electoral system, including a polling station, a 
campaign hall, and the House of Commons. It also 
includes a game which sends players to ten federal 


electoral districts to answer questions based on what 
they have learned. 


The vote in Canadian history 


Canadians of all ages will be interested in A History of 
the Vote in Canada, a new book published by Elections 
Canada recounting how the right to vote has evolved 
over the past 250 years. The book was launched by the 
Right Honourable Roméo LeBlanc, Governor General 
of Canada, on December 8, 1997. A History of the Vote 
in Canada is both an educational resource and a 
lasting reminder for Canadians of the evolution and 
significance of the right to vote. 


Maintaining election readiness 


As part of its mandate, Elections Canada is required to 
maintain a state of readiness for an electoral event at 
all times. Most of its activities between electoral events 
are geared toward this requirement. 


Returning officers 


An important part of maintaining election readiness 
is having returning officers in place in each of the 
country’s 301 electoral districts. Since the June 1997 
general election, seven returning officers have 
resigned, while another has died. Four new returning 
officers have been appointed, and another four 
positions are in the process of being filled. Plans are 
under way to provide training to the newly appointed 
returning officers, so that they are able to assume 
their duties at a moment’s notice. 


Elector registration system 


Elections Canada is also in the process of redeveloping 
the field application it has been using to produce lists 
of electors (ECAPLE — Elections Canada Automated 
Production of the Lists of Electors). The system is 

now used primarily to revise the preliminary list of 
electors which is produced from the National Register 
of Electors. The redesign has been necessitated 

by the arrival of the Register, the elimination of 
enumeration, and the necessity to integrate the 
elector registration system more closely with other 
field activities and systems, such as the Election Results 


‘\ 


System, the Event Management System, and the 
processes related to the Special Voting Rules. 


Electoral maps 


The electoral maps used during the last general 
election were lacking information. Accurate, 
up-to-date, and detailed maps are important tools 
for the effective administration of an electoral event. 
As part of Elections Canada’s continuing effort to 
increase the accuracy and quality of its mapping 
products, it has initiated, together with Statistics 
Canada, a joint project to build a national 
geocartographic database which will permit both 
agencies to revise and produce maps to meet the 
needs of electoral and census events. It will convert 
the agencies’ existing geography databases into a 
format for ongoing maintenance and use. To maintain 
the currency of the National Geocartographic 
Database, Elections Canada and Statistics Canada will 
seek data from external sources on an ongoing basis. 
By pursuing this initiative jointly, Elections Canada 
and Statistics Canada are reducing their 
developmental costs; improving the currency and 
accuracy of the database; sharing, rather than 
competing for, scarce technical and operational 
resources; and taking the necessary steps towards 
potential longer-term co-operation for ongoing 
maintenance of the geocartographic database. 


Registration of political parties 


As part of maintaining a state of election readiness, 
Elections Canada ensures that the registration status 
of political parties is kept up-to-date. Following the 
June 1997 general election, there were 10 registered 
political parties in Canada. The only party to apply 
for registered status since that election was the 
Communist Party of Canada, which was accepted for 
registration on October 17, 1997. 


Information technology 


The efficient administration of elections has become 
increasingly dependent upon information technology 
over the past several years. For activities ranging from 
preparing the preliminary list of electors to posting 
election results on the Web, to reporting on and 


checking candidate expenses, computers have become 
an integral part of every step. 

Elections Canada is in the process of ensuring 
that all of its computer systems will be ready for the 
Year 2000, so that it can respond to an electoral event 
before, during and after 2000, without disruption. 
Although Elections Canada is well prepared, there 
is still a great deal of work to be done to ensure an 
efficient transition. Over the past several months, 
Elections Canada staff have been reviewing key areas; 
following their report, work will begin on converting 
all systems diagnosed as having problems to a state of 
Year 2000 readiness. 

Elections Canada will have successfully 
redeveloped the last of the four legacy systems residing 
on the VAX computer and deployed all four to the 
Oracle and Powerbuilder production environment by 
May 1998. These systems are the List of Candidates 
System (LOC), Control of Authorizations System 
(COA), Supplies Management System (SMS), and the 
Candidates’ Returns Management System (CRMS). 

As these systems were converted, a new function 
was added to enhance productivity. For instance, the 
LOC electronically exports candidate information to 
the Enquiries Unit System to answer public enquiries 
about candidates. It also electronically imports official 
election results from the Elections Results System, to 
better process candidates’ expense reports after an 
electoral event. The official list of candidates is also 
produced electronically for submission to the 
Department of National Defence and the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Finally, the 
list is now put on the Internet, to allow the public 
another way to access information about candidates. 

All these systems are Year 2000-ready, and will 
be available for use during future electoral events. 


Electronic voting 


To ensure it remains at the forefront of electoral 
management, Elections Canada is conducting a study 
of technology as it applies to the act of voting, to 
consider various approaches that may be considered 
for inplementing new procedures at the federal level. 
The goal of such procedures would be to increase the 
accessibility of the electoral process by providing more 
alternatives for all electors. 


As part of the study, Elections Canada will 
examine existing technologies to determine their 
suitability for adaptation to voting purposes. The study 
also reviewed trends in other countries, and assessed 
the challenges new ways of voting might bring. An 
essential part of the study was the conduct of round- 
table discussions with groups of key stakeholders, 
including parliamentarians, opinion-leaders, and 
representatives of various segments of the electorate, 
including people with disabilities and ethnocultural 
groups. Once completed, the study’s findings will be 
shared with members of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 


Northwest Territories elections 


On November 10, 1997, the Government of Canada 
and the Government of the Northwest Territories 
completed an elections agreement. The agreement 
allows the Government of Canada to provide financial 
assistance to the Territories to fund the election of 
members to the Legislative Assembly. It also provides 
for a one-time payment to allow the Territories to 
prepare and administer the first elections in 1999 for 
members of the Legislative Assembly for Nunavut 
and remaining Northwest Territories. Until that 
agreement, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada was 
also the Chief Electoral Officer of the Northwest 
Territories. This agreement also includes the 
administration of elections in the Nunavut Territory, 
which will be created from the eastern part of the 
existing Northwest Territories, in 1999. 


International activities 


Elections Canada maintains contact with similar 
organizations in jurisdictions around the world, to 
exchange information, and learn from each others’ 
experience in electoral matters. As well, Elections 
Canada works with the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade and the Canadian 
International Development Agency (CIDA) to provide 
technical and professional assistance to other countries. 
As part of these activities, a team of Canadians 
and other international advisors helped to plan and 
carry out municipal elections in Bosnia in September 


1997. Three Canadians stayed on to help organize the 
national assembly elections in Republika Srpska and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1997; two 
remain on site today, providing support for the 
Provisional Election Commission, on which one 
serves as vice-president. 

Other areas of international involvement for 
Elections Canada include an ongoing partnership with 
the Russian Central Electoral Commission, designed 
to strengthen the Commission’s managerial and 
technical capacity to manage electoral events. The 
focus of activities is on improving the Commission’s 
legislation pertaining to the participation of Russian 
citizens travelling or living abroad and to the 
registration of electors. 

As well, Elections Canada continues work 
within its five-year bilateral technical co-operation 
agreement with Mexico’s Instituto Federal Electoral 
(IFE), which came into effect in June 1996. The 
purpose of the agreement is to identify and promote 
projects and programs in the fields of exchange, 
consultation, co-operation, and technical assistance at 
the bilateral and international levels, relating to the 
subject matter of electoral administration, so as to 
consolidate institutional links between IFE and 
Elections Canada and assist both in achieving their 
respective aims. 

Elections Canada also provided two Canadian 
electoral experts to prepare and conduct a training 
workshop for the Independent Electoral Commission 
of Gambia. The objectives of the workshop were to 
enhance the national capacity to administer elections 
in Gambia, as well as to educate personnel of agencies 
whose functions are related to elections and to 
provide a forum within which to discuss solutions to 
problems that arise in election management. 

In addition, as part of its role on the 
international scene, Elections Canada often welcomes 
delegations to its offices in Ottawa, to provide 
information and presentations about Canada’s 
electoral system. Since June 1997, we have hosted 
13 visits from 12 countries: Bangladesh, Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Czech Republic, 

Great Britain, Mexico, Slovakia, Sweden, Togo, 
Russia and Yugoslavia. 


The Port Moody—Coquitlam by-election 


On October 1, 1997, Sharon Hayes, Reform Member As a result, the Chief Electoral Officer issued a 
of Parliament for Port Moody-Coguitlam, resigned writ to the returning officer for Port Moody—Coquitlam, 
her seat in the House of Commons. On February 22, directing her to hold a by-election. Table 1 provides an 
1998, the Governor in Council announced that the overview of the important milestones between the 
by-election to replace Ms. Hayes would be held on calling of the by-election and the return to the writ.

Communicating with electors 


As in all electoral events, Elections Canada worked to 
create awareness among the general public in the 
electoral district, as well as among political parties, 
candidates, and the media, of the by-election and of 
the key dates in the election period. 

Within days of the issue of the writ, each 
residence in the electoral district received a 
householder, or pamphlet, with the name and phone 
number for the office of the returning officer, 
information on the National Register of Electors, 
and details regarding how to have names added to, 
or corrected on, the list of electors. It also gave 
information on deadlines for the return of special 
ballot applications, key dates for advance polls, 
registering and voting on election day, and the 
residency requirements for voting in a by-election. 

A few days later, registered electors received the 
notice of Confirmation of Registration. This card 
provided details of where and when electors could 
vote, including the many alternatives that Elections 
Canada provides for electors unable to get to their 
local polling station on election day. Both the 
householder and the notice of Confirmation of 
Registration stressed the importance of keeping 
the notice until election day. 

All material required to inform the electorate 
was produced in both official languages. According 
to the 1996 census, some 10 825 people in Port 
Moody-Coguitlam (8.5 percent of the electoral 
district’s population) speak Chinese as their home 
language, making them the most significant minority 
language group to exist in the electoral district. Basic 
information was therefore also made available in 
Chinese through community associations to better 
enable members of the community to exercise their 
democratic right to cast a ballot. 

A week before the by-election, Elections Canada 
ran advertisements in community newspapers, 
including Chinese-language newspapers, providing 
electors with election day information. The 
advertisement was developed based on the “Step 
Right Up/C’est sur mon chemin” campaign used 
in the last general election. 


Elections Canada also worked closely with local 
media to help provide residents with necessary 
information. The agency provided media with an 
information kit containing news releases, the 
householder, an electoral district profile, and a 
calendar of key dates. In addition, the kit contained 
background information on a variety of topics, 
ranging from the electoral process and the role of 
Elections Canada, to Special Voting Rules (1.e., voting 
by special ballot), the National Register of Electors, 
and election expenses and contributions. Over the 
course of the 36-day campaign, Elections Canada 
issued 11 news releases highlighting key deadlines, 
election day reminders, and clarification of what the 
media could and could not report on the weekend 
preceding election day. 

All of these materials, as well as information for 
residents of the Port Moody—Coquitlam electoral 
district, were available on the special by-election 
segment of Elections Canada’s Web site. The list of 
official candidates, a profile of the electoral district, 
and the address and telephone number of the office 
of the returning officer were also available on the 
Web site, along with information on voting by those 
temporarily absent from the electoral district. On 
election night, election results were posted on the 
Web site as they became available. As well, Elections 
Canada’s Enquiries Unit operated on extended hours 
throughout the campaign to ensure that electors 
could ask questions and receive information. 


The list of electors 


For the first time, data from the National Register of 
Electors were used to prepare the preliminary list of 
electors for a by-election. Prior to generation of the 
preliminary list, the portion of the Register applicable 
to the Port Moody—Coquitlam electoral district was 
updated to remove duplicate registrations and the 
records of deceased electors, to add new electors, 

and to modify existing elector information. 

Residents of Port Moody—Coquitlam who were 
eligible to vote but whose names were not on the 
preliminary list of electors, and those whose name 
and/or address were incorrect, were advised to contact 


the office of the returning officer to correct the error 
or to obtain a registration application form. 

Those wishing to be added to the list of electors 
for the by-election were asked to provide their name, 
address, sex, signature, previous address, and date of 
birth. If this information could not be corroborated 
with information already in the National Register 
of Electors, electors were also asked to provide 
satisfactory proof of identity, with their name, address, 
and signature, before they could be added to the list 
of electors. 

In addition, Elections Canada undertook a 
targeted revision to add the names of electors from 
new housing developments and in residential 
institutions to the preliminary list of electors. 

Six institutions, including nursing homes, were 
visited by revising agents, and 1652 kits were 
distributed in new developments. 

Please see Figure | for the percentage of electors 
registered by each method of registration. 

The period for revision of the preliminary list of 
electors lasted from February 25, three days after the 
issuance of the writ, until March 24, six days before 
election day. Changes to the list of electors during this 
28-day period and the number of electors on the final 
list of electors, including those who registered at their 
polling stations on election day, are recorded in 
Table 2. 


The candidates and 
by-election results 


March 9 at 2 p.m., Pacific time, was the deadline for 
filing candidates’ nominations; 5 p.m. was the 
deadline for withdrawal or for making corrections to 
information on the candidates’ nomination papers. 

A total of eight candidates were registered for the 
by-election, six representing various political parties. 
There was one independent candidate, and one with 
no party affiliation. Once nominations were closed, 
the list of candidates was posted on Elections Canada’s 
Web site as well as transmitted to Canadian diplomatic 
missions and consular posts and to Canadian Forces 
bases by the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and the Department of 

National Defence respectively. The official list 


was also announced in a press release issued on 
March 10, 1998. 

A total of 28 756 electors cast their vote in the 
Port Moody—Coquitlam by-election. The majority cast 
their votes on election day, March 30, 1998, at one 
of the 222 polling stations located throughout the 
electoral district (see Table 3). Polling stations 
were open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Pacific time. 

For those unable to vote on election day, 
advance polls were held on March 20, 21 and 23, 1998. 

Electors who were travelling or temporarily 
residing outside Canada were able to vote by special

mail-in ballot under the Special Voting Rules. The 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade ensured that Canadians abroad were notified 

of their opportunity to cast a vote in the by-election 
through diplomatic missions and consular posts, while 
the Department of National Defence alerted Canadian 
Forces bases located both in and outside Canada of 
the same opportunity. 

As well, persons in institutions, including 
hospitals and correctional facilities, were permitted to 
vote in the by-election under the Special Voting Rules. 
Registration and voting in acute care hospitals was 
held on March 23 and 24. To facilitate the special 
voting in correctional facilities, information kits were 
supplied to the John Howard and Elizabeth Fry 
societies. 

Voter turnout was 36 percent, compared to 
67 percent for the electoral district in the June 1997 


general election. Statistics regarding the number of 
ballots cast by each of the different means can be 
found in Table 4. 

On election night, the returning officer’s 
Election Results System was linked to Elections 
Canada’s central computer; as votes were counted, 
they were transmitted to the Ottawa server for posting 
on the Elections Canada by-election Web site. Liberal 
candidate Lou Sekora received the most votes, and was 
declared to be the elected Member of Parliament for 
Port Moody—Coquitlam (see Table 5). 

Of the eight candidates, those receiving more 
than 15 percent of valid votes cast (three in total) will 
be eligible for a partial reimbursement of their election 
expenses as well as half of their nomination deposit. 
All candidates are eligible to receive the second half of 
the nomination deposit if they submit their returns 
on time.

Conclusion 


The Commissioner’s Office received only one complaint 
of an alleged offence to the Canada Elections Act, which 
is still under review. 

As Elections Canada moves into its second 
strategic planning exercise, we remain committed 
to ensuring that Canadians continue to benefit from 
the exercise of their democratic rights in the most 
informed and accessible manner possible. 

This report fulfills the statutory obligation 
of the Chief Electoral Officer to report on the 
Port Moody—Coquitlam by-election.
