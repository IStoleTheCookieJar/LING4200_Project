THE LEMNISCATE COIL 


April 1998 


Ml'. R. Ashley Falk, dinAinskay’a subscriber in New Zealand, recently sent me some 
very interesting information about the lemniscate coil which Philip Rodgers received 
as part of a free energy machine, as well as giving me an account of a talk by George 
Van Tassel when he was in New Zealand, which gives a fuller account of his contact 
than the one I have in Earth People, Space People and the CD-ROM Contact Disc: 

Note that I *ve also submitted in somefew enclosures that ifs possible you might find 
ofsome interest One th at *s a transcription ofa tape recording of George Van Tassets 
when here in Auckland, Nov Zealand on one of his visits. It concerns mainly time 
that he spent aboard a spacecraft These visitations have apparently taken place 
at some early part of the morning. 

Note that Pve also packaged an enclosure from the book **Tony Wedd - Nov Age 
Pioneer**, that concerns the section elaborating on the Lemniscate Coil, covering 
the construction of this coil, as had been seen in pictureform, when this was shown 
to Philip. That came to him as a mental image, when he had made contact with a 
fov and highly educated extraterrestrials that had taken him under their wing. 
Explaining all manner of technical devices and how they can be built. 

Please note that I*ve taken that section on the Lemniscate Coil and have illustrated 
some of it They haven *t come out exactly the way I might have liked them to, but 
it does,at least give some idea how the coils of the Lemniscate construction can be 
pictured. 

For I am of the view that the Lemniscate Coil is built up largely from Lakhovsky 
Oscillator Coils, that he had designedfor erecting around diseased plants. For th e 
dimensions amazingly seem very similar, though the oscillator coils do vary slightly 
in sizes, and gauge of wire, it depends on what application it*s put to. 

However, the nuts and bolts of it is that the Lemniscate Coil is after all made upfrom 
2 Lakhovsky Oscillator Coils, but with their ends joined and then realigned so that 
each loop is at right angles to the other. 

It*s interesting to note that the active energy force here appears very much based 
on the Vital Force (Prana). This is proved out by that **apple core** experiment 
That was suggested to be attempted to illustrate this very point, as brought up by 
one of our extraterrestrial friends, as hinted in the book **Tony Wedd, New Age 
Pioneer**.

from them. That 
stated, gave them a

enclosed a copy of an advertisement placed in one of the older 
Covering a ready assembled valve radio that one could obtain 
quite amazingly used these Lemniscate Coils, which they had 
much greatly improved level of performance than standard coils. 

The lemniscate coil is in our view a varia- 
tion on the lahkovsky single loop coil 
F oscillator used for plant therapeutics. But 

comprising of two lakhovsky oscillator 
A*'. ti\f j coils positioned one above each other, 
joined in the middle and positioned at 
right angles to one another, in the form of 
a figure eight That is, they have a twist in 
relation to the other. Often one loop is 
bigger than the other, generally it is the 
lower that is the larger. It*s as if it is acting 
as a transformer, as a step down 
autotransformer, but with the centretap 
removed. Allin all, it is possible that coils 
could be made the same diameter, or the 
greater on the top, though it is unsure how 
this will in practice work out, as it is 
uncommon to have a lemniscate as a step 
upward winding. For the type ofcurrent it 
is utilizing is akin to orgone energy in 
^ many ways, or a derivative of it based on 
^ vitality globule. What the extraterres- 

Cj trials refer to as the rms field (resonating 
V f*^(ignetic static) used to power their space 
#'^1 vehicles. In fact there is a similarity be¬ 
tween the rms field and depicting of the 
vitality globule that makes you think they 
might be one and the same thing. 





SCIENTIFICALLY—the BEST COIL

Talk by George Van Tassel, Auckland, November 1976. 

Russeli Thor by introduced the speaker: 

George Van Tassel was honi at Jefferson, Ohio in 1910. He is a UFO contactee and 
wrote several books on the subject in the 1950s. Mr Van Tassel has appeared on 
409 radio and television shows, and has given 297 lectures in the United States 
and Canada. He has been married for 38years and has three daughters and thirteen 
brilliant grandchildren. ...Designer, author, inventor, lecturer, radio and television 
personality, and airport operator...His success in every undertaking thrvughout 
his life qualifies him in experience beyond the level of aver'age acceptance, as an 
authority on varied subjects. Since the 1950s George has been engaged in Magnetic 
experiments under the dir'ection or Space Intelligences. 

The UFO subject is new and is unknown to many people and new to some, but, 
actually, there are records or Ships coming out or the skies in 6,000-year-old Sanskrit 
records. Those of you who have read any of Eric von Daniken’s books realize that 
there are artifacts and evidence or UFOs down through history. The Bible itself is 
probably one or the best books about UFOs, and every religion on earth started with 
Visitors coming out of the skies. In Japan, for instance, they have a flag which 
symbolizes the Sun; their pagodas tell or their people originally coming out or Space; 
and the Emperor of Japan was worshipped as a Deity rather tlian as a head of 
Government. That was until World War II, then the Americans went over there and 
changed everything. 

So UFOs aren't anything new really. As with a lot of things television, radio, 
telephones and steamboats - -you've got to realize that in the last ninety years our 
total science has developed. We have accomplished more in the last sixty years than 
we have throughout the rest of history, so the sudden acceleration of science and 
technology has made it possible for us to come from the horse and buggy to a man 
on the Moon in one generation. 

To give you an idea or my connection with this subject - in the first place, I started 
out of High School in 1927 in the aviation field. After three years with the Air Lines 
1 went to California and 1 worked in the Flight Test business with Douglas Lockheed 
and Howard Hughes for sixteen years. Then I got tired of the city, and after being out 
in the desert with Howard I went back to the desert and established an Airport, and 
I've operated that for the last twenty-nine years. Because the research developed, 
and I was doing two things at once, I sold the Airport last January, and now the 
research is the main thing and the most important thing. 

At 2 am on August 24, 1953 one or these UFOs landed at my airport, in the light of 
a full Moon, which, on the desert, is like daylight here under the cloud. A man got 

4 


olT the Ship and invited me on board. He showed me around the inside - it was the 
Adamski type bell craft or Ilattened-out 'Model T' version of their Space Ships. They 
are really Scout Ships carried aboard a carrier. The smallest carrier is a quarter of a mile 
long - that is quite a long piece of equipment.' Although we have railroad tracks that 
go for 3,000 miles as part of transportation, for a Ship to be a quarter of a mile long 
sounds pretty big to us. There were three other men on board the Craft. They don't 
introduce people like we do - we say "This is Mr So-and-so." The man who invited 
me on board said his name was Solgonda. They use one name - they don't have Mr, 
middle names, or first names and last names. You'll notice this all through the Bible 
too - there is only one name - Ezekiel, John, Abraham - it doesn't matter who they are, 
they use one name. 

One of the things that has caused confusion is that in many of the landings these 
people have been described differently . The people who were on board the Ship 
which landed at my airport could walk down our streets, in our clothes, and nobody 
would notice them. They looked like people, and the men, who talked to me in the 
finest English, reminded me very much of the way Ronald Colman spoke. I always 
considered that he spoke English perfectly. The three men on the Ship only turned 
and smiled over their shoulders as I walked behind them. When we went out to the 
Ship it was hovering about ten feet above the ground. I seemed to know what to do, 
I had no fear. It seemed as though this man was an old buddy of mine - that was the 
feeling 1 had. I think he mentally directed me. Looking back, that was the only way 
I could figure out how I did the right thing. The astonishing part of it was that every 
time I thought of a question to ask. I'd just got the first word out when he answered, 
and since they communicate by thought you could see him reading my thought and 
answering before I could ask the question. On the Ship he demonstrated how the seats 
retracted into the side, by causing them to fold out, also how the instruments on the 
shelf under the portholes retracted into the shelf And passing by the instrument 
panel - having been in the Flight. Test business, I was familiar with every type or 
instrument in our aircraft, and of course, there were those warning lights that we have 
in our cars to indicate when something is wrong. All of our instruments are dials and 
pointers or hands. Their instruments were veiy like thermometers, and one instrument 
was composed of tubes about one inch in diameter. These tubes had marks and 
hieroglyphic markings. There were no words or numbers as we understand - they were 
just symbols. Across this instrument from left to right it was blood red, on through 
orange, yellow, green, blue and violet, and white on the other side. The whole 
spectiiim was there. 1 don't know whether it was light or fluid in the tubes, but every 
tube had the*colour at a different level, relative 'to the marks on each tube. 

He opened a door above the shelf and hanging in there were garments, all of the same 
material, the same colour, no pockets,no zippers, no belts, no buttons, I inquired if 
their people were all the same size, because it looked as though all the uniforms were 

5 



ot'identical length. 1 le said, "No, our people vaiy in stature even as your people do." 
Iweiy time I thought or something to ask him it was immediately answered. It took 
a little getting used to when you are used to talking. 1 le said the uniforms were 
manufactured subject to theiTnal conditions, 1 knew that thermal meant heat. I le 
said that they fit very snugly and they are of a high insulation quality. The suits 
were of such quality that any normal range of heat or cold would be answered by 
the one uniform - they don't wear overcoats like we do. The suits were or a fine knit 
material very much like women's knitted dresses. He said if their people get too warm 
and stall to perspire the uniform expands. We could, do this very easily with themal 
cloth if we wanted to, because our scientists know how to do those things. However, 
it was different. 

1 le walked away from the clothing compartment and jumped down tlirough a hole in 
the floor. The hole was about as big as the average manhole in the street. As he 
squatted down and let himself down 1 could see that it was about four feet into the 
power section and the catwalk. As 1 jumped down the hole behind him, he said "Stoop 
so you won't hit your head." That was the first thing he'd said without me asking 
him something. As it was about four feet from the catwalk to the deck you would 
either have to squat down and walk like a duck or crawl around tliere. The catwalk 
was about thirty inches wide and there was a rotor spinning all the way round. The 
rotor and the spinner were the same weight and they would counteract torque on the 
ship, so neither one would make the ship spin - why we put a tail rotor on a helicopter 
- to keep the tail from spinning around from the torque of the lift rotor. 1 looked around 
there for a while, the first thing that came into mind was Ezekiel's wheels within wheels. 
When he smiled, I knew that he knew what 1 was thinking 

Afler looking for a few minutes 1 could see that there were four coils which looked 
as though they had been wound out of stainless steel tubing. The winding looked 
about the size or my thumb in diameter and it was faced round in a North-South-East- 
West direction, perpendicular to each other. Then 1 noticed that the inner rotor either 
had a hair going around on it or it had a scratch on it. It was so highly powered you 
couldn’t tell it was turning, apart from the scratch or hair going around. I estimated 
the RPMs at about helicopter rotor speed - 250 RPMs per minute. I le motioned upward 
and so I pushed myself up the hole to the upper deck. When we had gone aboard 
this thing ve had walked underneath it and there was a yellow spot on the ground 
which was caused by some type of beam that you couldn't sec as a ray. We walked 
into the spot and drilled right up to the bottom or the Ship on some kind of anti-gravity 
lill. As we started to leave the Ship I estimated that I had been aboard about twenty 
minutes - it was a mental estimate as I did not have my watch. 

I le walked over and stepped right in that hole as though there was something to step 
on, and when 1 looked down the hole I could see that it was about ten feet down to 


6 


the ground. That is a pretty long jump, and not being used to being supported by the 
beam, down on the edge of the hole and prepared to jump and hit the ground hard. 

1 le looked up and grinned at me because I was going down just about the same speed 
1 went up, and I was crouched down as though I was going to take the impact from the 
jump. As I realized that I wasn't going to hit hard I straightened out, (Another thing 
I did not tell you about - when we approached the Ship I got nauseated- like butterflies 
in the stomach - and the minute we got underneath it shut off like a switch - the nausea 
stopped.) We walked back to where I was sleeping outside - because in August in the 
desert it is hot - we get up to 115 degrees to 120 degrees in the shade. It is a dry heat 
so we don't feel it too much, we have a low humidity about 17 to 28 per cent. We get 
3.5 inches of rain a year - that's why we appreciate your green country. 

As we walked back from the Ship he said, "Would you be interested in doing something 
that would be of benefit to your people?" It's still pretty hard to grasp the fact that I'm 
taking pail in an experience with somebody from another planet - you don't grasp 
these things that fast. You just go through the motions at the time - just as you do when 
you get hit by a car. You get up and cross the street and look around to see if anybody 
saw how stupid you were to let that car hit you, and then you begin to analyse where 
did it come from? - and so forth. So I was really involved in this by their activity and 
request, rather than anything 1 started to do myself, and when you become the victim 
or circumstance you follow through with whatever takes place next. If any of you were 
asked the same question the answer would be 'Yes', because we certainly know we 
need somebody to straighten out the situation. 

Solgonda said he would require the building of a dome shaped structure of non-metallic 
materials and it would have to be a minimum of 18 feet radius. I could picture that in 
my mind, not really grasping all the requirements of the building codes and the legal 
angles. I just said 'Yes', and he said 1 would have to take and wind coils in opposite 
directions, starting from the centre of the wire and the wires cross every 180 degrees, 
and that makes what we call a caduceus winding. 

To be continued 

A quotation from Fate magazine of February 1997y also sent by Mr. Falk. This 
shows that Van TasseVs **caduceus windings** were also in part inspired by 
Lahkovsky: 

The four aliens also gave Van Tassel a "Venusian Gift to Mankind"- the instructions 
for an architectural wonder called the Integratron. Van Tassel said the aliens actually 
implanted the plans in his brain. The Integratron was a high-voltage, electrostatic 
generator designed to recharge the human cell structure. It was based on the principles 
of the crossing of two vortices - cosmic power sources that held rejuvenating and 
healing properties.

Van Tassel said the Integratron would add 50 to 80 years to the life of those exposed 
to the healing properties of its energy frequencies. He hoped tlie Integrati on would 
rejuvenate thousands of people. Van Tassel hired a Pasadena architect to draw 
blueprints for the general structure of the Integratron. 

1 he foundation was laid about three miles from Giant Rock, and Van Tassel and his 
son-in-law began building the dome in 1954. Van Tassel incorporated the 
elecrromagnetic research of Nikola Tesla, George Lakliovsky, and other specialists 
in tlie field. Renowned engineers and scientists also came to the site and contributed 
their ideas to the project. But the main portion of the information used to create the 
Integratron, Van Tassel claimed, came from Venus. 

To fund his project. Van Tassel began conducting UFO conventions from his home. 
Giant Rock was temporarily renamed "Spaceport Earth" during these gatherings. The 
meetings gave fellow contactees and enthusiasts a place to compare experiences. 
Early believers in the UFO phenomenon could discuss their beliefs openly, without 
fear of ridicule from the outside world -something that Van Tassel's daughters had 
sufiered on an almost daily basis at the public school they attended in the neighboring 
community of Twentynine Palms. 

Van Tassel spent approximately a quarter of a million dollars and several years 
building the Venusian "fountain of youth." Unfortunately, he died in 1978, at the age 
of 68, before the Venusians gave him the information he needed to complete the 
Integratron. 

Idttle work has been done on the structure since Van Tassel's death, because only 
the aliens knew how to complete it. Van Tassel left no written instructions. Around 
the time of his death. Van Tassel estimated the project to be about 82 percent complete. 

The building remains to this day, surrounded by fences to keep out vandals. It's a 
two-storey domed, wood structure, 35 feet high and 50 feet in diameter. Inside, both 
fioors are practically bare, except for a large support pole in the center that houses 
coils designed for their healing powers. There's a similar coil in the ceiling of the top 
tloor. Large metal spokes outside the structure, powered by an air compressor, are 
designed to lift up and spin clockwise around the dome. The device's fiberglass 
bearings would then create static electricity. Van Tassel said the spinning motion 
would generate a wave of energy and send it inside the dome.

LETTERS 


From Sten Lindgren, Sweden: 

Deal' Cosmic Friend Jim, 

Thanks for your letter of Dec 9. I have a 40 year experience of space-ships and 1 have 
about 32 years of direct physical contact. 1 have been working with the Brotliers 
(C.B.H) and had many contacts during the years. I send you a short presentation 
of some of the experiences. Many of the events (close encounters ) have been 
observed by many other friends and co-workers. One of my friends, Christer Janson, 
who attended the first planned landing contact with me and three other friends, was 
also given permission to meet one of the spacepeople at 2-3 of my regular contacts. 
The meetings and contacts have all been physical. What is the most interesting part 
of my book is that it is containing the rules for the comming official contact and the 
strategy of C.B.H. No MASS-LANDINGS will happen. There are other plans. The 
book is not yet translated into English. ("Dialogue with Cosmic Culture"). Merry 
Christmas and a Happy New Year and good luck with your cosmic work. 

A SHORT PRESENTATION OF EXPERIENCES OF ESTABLISHED 
CONTACTS BETWEEN STEN LINDGREN AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ONE 
EXTRA-TERRESTRIALCIVIUSATION 

The first observation of an extra-terrestrial ship occured 1957. He has observed over 
200 space ships within 37 years. There have ben all kinds of observations from small 
unmanned sonds up to I km long cigar-shaped motherships. First contact with extra¬ 
terrestrial person was 1963. First physical communication took place 1965 with some 
representatives from one of about 10 extra-terrestrial groups, which have ongoing 
projects here on planet Earth. This cosmic group, which we call CBH (Cosmic Brother 
Hood) tells us that we are related back in time. We have same ancestors. 

CBH has knowledge of our planet history for 500 000 years back in time.'They are 
800 000 - 900 000 years ahead us. These extra-terrestrials have another type of 
knowledge about energy, time and gravitation, hyperfast transports in the Universe. 
In our Galaxy a transport can be made within a couple of hours. There are persons 
from this outer space group on our planet, who observe our civilisation. All 
information was given to Sten through the main communication channel "BEA". She 
cooperated with Sten 1965 - 80. BEA was a physical person by that time in Sweden. 
These extra-terrestrial people "the nordic type" look like us. They are about 170 - 
180 cm tall. This e.t. group has made a couple of psychological tests in Sweden. The 
firstone, Sten knows, was made October 291965 at 7 o'clock pm. There were sightings 
all over in Sweden. Some different 350 space ships appeared in the skies from South 
to North all over the country. There were articles written in almost all Swedish 
newspapers. 


9 









rhe chief editor of the biggest morning paper "Dagens Nyheter" wrote an article 
about his own observ'ation. He saw one of the cigar-shaped motherships hovering 
over Stockliolm. News in radio and TV. Sten, Christer Jensson and some other 
persons have been informed of the coming operation 3 weeks time before it took 
place. One of the space ships went down over the Swedish Television buildings 
at Valhalla-way in Stockholm. The craft flew over a TV-studio called A1 and there 
this 60 meters wide craft passed just 60-70 meters above "Aktuellt"-studio (TVl, 
news). There were two persons of the T V-staff who saw the craft. Recognition was 
then made to prepare a coming operation in the end of 1968. Through the second 
operation a remote-check was made by the extra terrestrials to analyse the public 
reactions for UFO-pictures and films shown during the T V-program "Timmen" (The 
Hour) number 12 the 7 December 1968. This check was made during the time 
Swedish Television broadcasted the program. Next contact with BE A in the end 
of’68 there was a proposal if CBH could arrange a possibility for two producers, 
Mona Sjostrom and Ulf Hultberg, to see a craft very close. This happened spring 
1969 at a large manor house in Gnesta in Sormland. Even T V-producer Jeanette von 
Heidenstam and chief editor of one of the biggest morning papers "Svenska 
Dagbladet" Allan Hemelius visited same place by that time. 

1984 Sten had contact with another representative of this extra-terrestrial group to 
discuss possibility for observations over Dalama (a landscape about 300 Km north 
of Stockholm). Two persons, Bertil Kuhleman and Par-Anders Langsvens, was 
informed by Sten about this plan in advance. In the end of 1984 OK was given for 
start during a lecture given by Sten in RattvikArallberg. Some 30 persons were 
present. The bookwriter Lennart Lidfors was there among the audience. Information 
was given that sightings should start in the beginning of January. The 9th of 
January 1985 one of the biggest UFO-flaps in Sweden started at Dalama. There were 
over 250 observations within two weeks time. 1991 next big operation of this cosmic 
group started in Sweden over Gothellburg-area. Then big triangle-shaped crafts 
were observed. Same type of crafts have appeared in Belgium 1990-91 over EG- and 
NATO-headquarters. 

From Major Hans Petersen^ Denmark, 

DearJim, 

Thank you for your short letter and the attached newsletters - they are well written 
and in a sober way, which make it possible for the reader to understand the message. 
T he problem with most magazines and newsletters are, that they are a mixture of 
religious and sectarian nonsense, which spread a lot of confusion all over and it 
is making a picture of the whole UFO-matter which is wide out of range. In your 
October newsletter you mention the incident, where Adamski and Madelaine 


10 


Rodeffer filmed the Flying Saucer. In fact the space people came 8 o'clock in the 
morning asking them to be ready to film, because as they said, we will be coming 
sometimes during the day. And then three space people came late afternoon and 
said: So, now we come. 

I was a trusted co-worker of Adamski from 1957 until he died in 1965. It was while 
he was with us in Denmark in 1963, that he received the little parcel from a man fiom 
Venus who asked him to deliver it to Pope John as soon as possible. I therefore had 
to re-arrange his European-trip by cancelling the trips to Finland and Germany. While 
with us he told us many things, which have never been published, and the most 
valuable to us was his detailed description of the different space objects. 

Before that time I had already experienced quite a lot, seeing a mothership and Flying 
Saucers, but after his visit and his ’briefing’ both my wife and I experienced just, what 
George had told us. A Flying Saucer landing near our car and showing us how it 
camouflaged itself, a Telemeterdisc landing on our terrace and showed us how it 
destroyed itself - right in from of us, a Flying Saucer which came in when Dan and 
Pam visited us. We were sitting around midnight talking about Adamski and the 
UFO-matter in general, when all the sudden one - only one - of our big windows were 
lighted for a very short moment with a dark red light. I right away said: "So, now they 
come, let us get out to look." Out we saw a bright light coming in from the west, 
passing a bit to the south. I said, ’it will probably turn right and make a full turn over 
the sea and then come back in. And it did just that and coming back in it passed right 
over us and disappeared to the north. 

I could talk about Adamski for hours-in 1995 I talked for about 1 hour about Adamski 
in the UN in New York. I also want to tell you, that I probably have the most baffling 
pictures from the Moon, which any privateperson have. An American friend of mine 
was going to meet with the director of a university in California. While waiting in the 
lobby he noticed some moon pictures and were looking at them, when the director 
arrived. He asked if my friend was interested in moon pictures and my friend told him, 
that he had a friend in Denmark who was. He then got the address where to write for 
them and did then send the address to me. 

I right away wrote a letter to this NASA address, where I told, that I was an Air Force 
Officer, and that I would like to receive some moon pictures for educational purposes. 
Here I have to tell you, that I am sure, they already knew me or found out who this 
person was asking for such pictures. Never mind. I received a nice letter from NASA 
telling me, that the pictures I needed, should be ordered somewhere else and they 
gave me a new address and a special code. I wrote this address with the same message 


11 



and shortly after I received a letter, where they began with "Dear Friend", but then 
infomied me, that what I needed could only be received from still another addressand 
another special code. Again I wrote and again I received an answer which began like 
this: 

"Dear Colleague. We are sending you the requested materials, which you may expect 
to receive in a couple of weeks." They wrote some more, but this beginning was 
interesting. After some time the post office called me on the telephone and asked me 
to send a couple of men to pick up a large packet from the US. This packet contained 
maps for the whole Moon and large catalogues referring to each map plus 6000 micro 
filmed moon pictures taken inside the borders of the maps. I had these pictures 
enlarged and found WATER, SMOKE, CONSTRUCTIONS and SIGNS OF 
INTELLIGENT ACTIVITIES. Why did they send this to me? Maybe they wanted 
me to distribute them - and I would have liked to, but in my own little country it would 
not have been possible and still isn't. I lend some copies of some of the pictures to 
Fred Steckling, but unfortunately he 'stole' them and used them in his books about 
the Moon - but not in the same way as I would have done, had I had the possibility 
to publish them. Had I ever found an English or American publisher, who would 
publish a book for me, I would have published these pictures and told the story about 
them and my interpretation of them. BUT, I have never found such a publisher. 

Until now I have seen Motherships, Flying Saucers and Telemeterdiscs and UFO's 
more than 50 times. The kind of object we saw together with Dan and Pam has visited 
us many times. Two years ago we moved to the present address and since then it 
has passed over our house twice, so they are still with us. So far all governments 
have kept secret, that the 12th planet, which Sitchen mention in his book 'The 12tli 
Iftanet' is coming close. It was discovered the year before last by an Chilean 
astronomer named Ferrada. It will be visible on the 11 th of august 1999, but already 
now we can feel its inffuence - for instance on the weather. (Can this he the "great 
king of tetror coming from the sky in 1999", mentioned by Nostradamus? - J.G.) 
It is calculated to be 35 times bigger than Earth, and it will penetrate the inner solar 
system. So, my friend -1 wish you a personal pleasant New Year and let us together 
hope and pray for a bright future for our planet - after all.
