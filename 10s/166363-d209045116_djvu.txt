or  cessation  at  any  time  of  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  minerais,  and  without  further  payments  than  the  royalties  herein  provided,  and  notwithstanding  anything  else 
herein  contained  to  the  contrary,  this  Lease  shall  be  for  a  term  of  Three  f3)  years  from  Ihe  date  hereof  (called  "Primary  Term")  and  as  long  thereafter  as  oil,  gas  or  other 
mineral  is  produced  from  said  Land  or  land  pooled  therewith  hereunder,  or  as  long  as  this  Lease  is  continued  in  effect,  as  otherwise  provided  herein. 

3.  The  royalties  to  be  paid  by  Lessee  arc:  (a)  on  oil,  20.00%  of  that  produced  and  saved  from  said  Land  .  the  same  to  be  delivered  at  the  wells  or  to  the  credit  of 
Lessor  into  the  pipeline  to  which  the  wells  may  be  connected;  Lessee  may  from  time  to  time  purchase  any  royalty  oil  in  its  possession,  paying  the  market  price  therefore 
prevailing  for  the  field  where  produced  on  the  date  of  purchase,  and  Lessee  may  sell  any  royalty  oil  in  its  possession  and  pay  Lessor  the  price  received  by  Lessee  for  such 
oil  computed  at  the  well:  (b)  on  gas,  including  casinghead  gas  or  other  gaseous  substance,  produced  from  the  Land  and  sold  or  used  off  the  Lease  Premises  or  for  the 
extraction  of  gasoline  or  other  product  therefrom,  the  market  value  at  the  well  of  20.00%  of  the  gas  so  sold  or  used,  provided  that  on  gas  sold  by  Lessee  the  market  value 
shall  not  exceed  the  amount  received  by  Lessee  for  such  gas  computed  at  the  mouth  of  the  well,  and  on  gas  sold  at  the  well  the  royalty  shall  be  20.00%  of  the  amount 
realized  by  Lessee  from  such  sale;  and  (c)  on  fissionable  materials  and  all  other  minerals  mined  and  marketed,  one-tenth  either  in  kind  or  value  at  the  well  or  mine,  at 
Lessee's  election,  except  that  on  sulfur  mined  or  marketed,  the  royalty  shall  be  Two  Dollars  ($2.00)  per  long  ton.  If  the  price  of  any  mineral  or  substance  upon  which 
royalty  is  payable  hereunder  is  regulated  by  any  governmental  agency,  the  market  value  or  market  price  of  such  mineral  or  substance  for  the  purpose  of  computing  royalty 
hereunder  shall  not  be  in  excess  of  the  price  which  Lessee  may  receive  and  retain.  Lessee  shall  have  free  from  royalty  or  other  payment  the  use  of  water,  other  than  water 
from  Lessor's  wells  or  tanks,  and  of  oil,  gas  and  coal  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises  in  all  operations  which  Lessee  may  conduct  hereunder,  including  water  injection 
and  secondary  recovery  operations,  and  the  royalty  on  oil,  gas  and  coal  shall  be  computed  after  deducting  any  so  used.  If  Lessee  drills  a  well  on  said  Land  or  on  land 
pooled  therewith,  which  well  is  capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas  but  such  well  is  not  being  produced  and  this  Lease  is  not  being  maintained  otherwise  as  provided  herein, 
this  Lease  shall  not  terminate,  whether  it  be  during  or  afteT  the  Primary  Term,  (unless  released  by  Lessee)  and  it  shall  nevertheless  be  considered  that  oil  and  gas  is  being 
produced  from  the  Lease  Premises  covered  by  this  Lease  when  Lessee  shall  pay  or  tender  (or  make  a  bona  fide  attempt  to  pay  or  tender)  ae  royalty  to  the parties .who  at  the

royalty  owner  or  owners'  agent,  and  shall  continue  as  depository  for  all  such  sums  which  lessee  may  pay  hereunder  regardless  of  changes  in  ownership  or  royalties)  the 
sum  of  One  and  no/1 00  Dollar  ($  1 .00)  for  each  calendar  month,  or  portion  thereafter  during  which  said  well  is  situated  on  the  Lease  Premises,  or  on  land  pooled  therewith, 
and  this  Lease  is  not  otherwise  maintained,  or  this  Lease  is  not  released  by  Lessee  as  to  the  land  on  which  or  the  horizon,  zone  or  formation  in  which  the  well  is  completed. 
The  first  payment  of  such  sum  .  shall  be  made  on  or  before  the  first  day  ofeach  calendar  month  after  expiration  of  ninety  (90)  days  from  the  date  the  lease  is  not  otherwise 
maintained  for  all  accruals  to  such  date,  and  thereafter  on  or  before  the  first  day  of  each  third  calendar  month  for  all  accruals  to  each  such  date  to  Lessor's  designated 
depository  bank  or,  if  a  depository  is  not  designated  above,  then  mailed  on  or  before  the  due  date  of  payment  to  the  parties  entitled  thereto  at  Lessor's  address  set  forth 
above  or  to  the  last  known  address  provided  in  writing  to  Lessee  by  Lessor.  Lessee's  failure  to  properly  or  timely  pay  or  tender  any  such  sum  as  royalty  shall  render 
Lessee  liable  for  the  amount  due  but  it  shall  not  operate  to  terminate  this  lease.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary.  Lessee  may  from  time  to  time  withhold  and 
accumulate  such  payments  payable  to  Lessor  until  the  first  of  the  calendar  month  following  the  accumulation  of  Twenty-Five  and  no/1 00  Dollars  ($25.00)  when  payment 
shall  be  made  as  above  provided. 

4.  The  cash  down  payment  is  consideration  for  this  Lease  according  to  its  terms  and  shall  not  be  allocated  as  rental  for  a  period.  Lessee  may  at  any  time,  and  from 
time  to  time,  execute  and  deliver  to  Lessor,  or  to  the  depository'  bank,  or  file  for  record  a  release  or  releases  of  this  Lease  as  to  any  part  or  all  of  said  Land  or  of  any  mineral 
or  subsurface  interval  or  any  depths  thereunder  and  thereby  he  relieved  of  all  obligations  as  to  the  released  land,  mineral,  horizon,  zone  or  formation.  If  this  Lease  is 
released  as  to  all  minerals,  horizons,  iones  and  formations  under  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  the  shut-in  royalty  and  other  payments  computed  in  accordance  therewith 
shall  thereupon  be  reduced  in  the  proportion  that  the  acreage  released  bears  to  the  acreage  which  was  covered  by  this  Lease  immediately  prior  to  such  release. 

5.  Lessee,  at  its  option,  is  hereby  given  the  right  and  power  during  or  after  the  Primary  Term  while  this  Lease  is  in  effect  to  pool  or  combine  the  Lease  Premises, 
or  any  portion  thereof,  as  to  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals,  or  any  of  them,  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  Lease,  and/or  any  other  land,  lease  or  leases  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  thereof,  when  in  Lessee's  judgment  it  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  do  so  in  order  properly  to  explore,  or  to  develop  and  operate  the  Lease  Premises  in  compliance 
with  the  spacing  rules  of  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas,  or  other  lawful  authority,  or  when  to  do  so  would,  in  the  judgment  of  Lessee,  promote  the  conservation  of  oil, 
gas  or  other  mineral  in  and  under  and  that  may  be  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises.  Units  pooled  for  oil  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  40  acres  each  plus  a 
tolerance  of  10%  thereof;  and  units  pooled  for  gas  hereunder  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  160  acres  each  plus  a  tolerance  of  10%  thereof,  provided  that  should 
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  prescribe  or  permit  the  creation  of  units  larger  than  those  specified,  units  thereafter  created  may  conform  substantially  in  size 
with  those  prescribed  or  permitted  by  governmental  regulations.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  stated  herein,  a  unit  for  a  horizontal  well  may  include  (i)  the 
amount  of  acreage  allowed  for  obtaining  a  permit  to  drill  a  well  under  the  spacing  and  density  provisions  in  the  applicable  field  or  statewide  rules  for  a  vertical  wellbore, 
plus  the  additional  acreage  listed  in  the  tables  in  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas  Rule  86  (density  greater  than  40  acres),  or  (ii)  the  amount  of  acreage  allowed  for 
obtaining  a  full  production  allowable  under  the  applicable  field  or  statewide  rules  for  a  vertical  wellbore,  plus  the  additional  acreage  listed  in  the  tables  in  the  Railroad 
Commission  of  Texas  Rule  86  (density  greater  than  40  acres).  Lessee  may  pool  or  combine  the  Lease  Premises  or  any  portion  thereof  as  above  provided  as  to  oil  in  any 
one  or  more  strata  and  as  to  gas  in  any  one  or  more  strata.  Units  formed  by  pooling  as  to  any  stratum  or  strata  need  not  conform  in  size  or  area  with  units  as  to  any  other 
stratum  or  strata,  and  oil  units  need  not  conform  as  to  area  with  gas  units.  Pooling  in  one  or  more  instances  shall  not  exhaust  the  rights  of  Lessee  to  pool  this  Lease  or 
portions  thereof  into  other  units.  Lessee  shall  file  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which  the  Lease  Premises  is  situated  an  instrument  describing  and 
designating  the  pooled  acreage  as  a  pooled  unit;  the  unit  shall  become  effective  as  provided  in  said  instruments,  or  if  said  instrument  makes  no  such  provision,  it  shall 
become  effective  upon  the  date  it  is  Hied  for  record.  Each  unit  shall  be  effective  as  to  all  parties  hereto,  their  heirs,  successors  and  assigns,  irrespective  of  whether  or  not 
the  unit  is  likewise  effective  as  to  all  other  owners  ofsurface,  mineral,  royalty  or  other  rights  in  land  included  in  such  unit.  Lessee  may  at  its  election  exercise  its  pooling 
option  as  to  oil,  gas  and  odier  minerals  before  or  after  commencing  operations  for  or  completing  an  oil  or  gas  well  or  wells  or  mine  for  other  mineral  on  the  Lease  Premises, 
and  the  pooled  unit  may  include,  but  is  not  required  to  include,  land  or  leases  upon  which  a  well  or  mine  capable  of  producing  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities 
has  theretofore  been  completed  or  upon  which  operations  for  drilling  of  a  well  or  mine  for  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  have  theretofore  been  commenced.  Operations  for 
drilling  on,  or  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  from  any  part  of  a  pooled  unit  which  include,  all  or  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  regardless  of  whether  such 
operations  for  drilling  were  commenced  or  such  production  was  secured  before  or  after  the  execution  of  this  Lease  or  the  instrument  designating  the  pooled  unit,  shall  he 
considered  as  operations  for  drilling  on  or  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  from  the  Lease  Premises  whether  or  not  the  well  or  wells  or  mine  be  located  on  Lhe  Lease 
Premises,  and  the  entire  acreage  constituting  such  unit  or  units,  as  to  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals,  or  any  of  them,  as  herein  provided,  shall  be  treated  for  all  purposes,  except 
the  payment  of  royalties  on  production  from  the  pooled  unit,  as  if  the  same  were  included  in  this  Lease;  provided  that  if  after  creation  of  a  pooled  unit,  a  well  or  mine  drilled 
on  the  unit  area,  other  than  on  the  land  covered  hereby  and  included  in  the  unit,  which  well  is  not  classified  as  the  type  of  well  for  which  the  unit  was  created  (oil,  gas  or 
other  mineral  as  the  case  may  be),  such  well  or  mine  shall  be  considered  a  dry  hole  for  purposes  of  applying  the  additional  drilling  and  reworking  provisions  of  Paragraph 
6  hereof  If  an  oil  well  on  an  oil  unitt  which  includes  all  ot  a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  is  reclassified  as  a  gas  well,  or  if  a  gas  well  on  a  gas  unit,  which  includes  all  or 
a  portion  of  the  Lease  Premises,  is  reclassified  as  an  oil  well,  the  date  of  such  reclassification  shall  be  considered  as  the  date  of  cessation  of  production  for  purposes  of 
applying  the  additional  drilling  and  reworking  provisions  of  Paragraph  6  hereof  as  to  all  leases  any  part  of  which  are  included  in  the  unit  other  than  the  leased  premises  on 
which  the  well  is  located.  For  the  purpose  of  computing  royalties  to  which  owners  of  royalties  and  payments  out  of  production  and  each  of  them  shall  be  entitled  on 
production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  from  each  pooled  unit,  there  shall  be  allocated  to  the  Lease  Premises  and  included  in  said  unit  {or  to  each  separate  tract  within  the

unit  if  this  Lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  a  pro  rata  portion  of  the  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  produced  from  the  unit  after  deducting  that  used  for  operations  on 
the  unit.  Such  allocation  shall  be  on  an  acreage  basis  -  that  is,  there  shall  be  allocated  to  the  acreage  covered  by  this  Lease  and  included  in  the  pooled  unit  (or  to  each 
separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  Lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  pro  rata  portion  of  the  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  produced  from  the  unit  which  the 
riumber  of  surface  acres  covered  by  this  Lease  (or  in  each  separate  tract)  and  included  in  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres  included  in  the  unit.  As  used  in 
this  paragraph,  the  words,  "separate  tract"  mean  any  tract  with  royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from  that  as  to  any  other  part 
of  the  Lease  Premises.  Royalties  hereunder  shall  be  computed  on  the  portion  of  such  production,  whether  it  be  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals,  so  allocated  to  the  Lease  Premises 
grid  included  in  the  unit  just  as  though  such  production  were  from  such  land.  Production  from  an  oil  well  will  be  considered  as  production  from  the  lease  or  oil  pooled  unit 
from  which  it  is  producing  and  not  as  production  from  a  gas  pooled  unit  and  production  from  a  gas  well  will  be  considered  as  production  from  the  lease  or  gas  pooled  unit 
from  which  it  is  producing  and  not  from  an  oil  pooled  unit.  Any  pooled  unit  designated  by  Lessee  in  accordance  with  the  terms  hereof  may  be  dissolved  by  Lessee  by 
instrument  filed  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which  the  Lease  Premises  is  situated  at  any  time  after  completion  of  a  dry  hole  or  cessation  of 
production  on  said  unit. 

6.  If  at  the  expiration  of  the  Primary  Term,  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  not  being  produced  on  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith,  but  Lessee  is  then 
engaged  in  drilling  or  reworking  operations  thereon,  or  shall  have  completed  a  dry  hole  thereon  within  1 80  days  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Primary  Term,  this  Lease  shall 
remain  in  force  so  long  as  operations  on  said  well  or  for  drilling  or  reworking  of  any  additional  well  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  60  consecutive  days,  and 
if  they  result  in  the  production  of  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral,  so  long  thereafter  as  oil.  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled 
therewith.  If,  after  the  expiration  of  the  Primary  Term  of  this  Lease  and  after  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith, 
the  production  thereof  should  cease  from  any  cause,  this  Lease  shall  not  terminate  if  Lessee  commences  operations  for  drilling  or  reworking  within  180  days  after  the 
cessation  of  such  production,  but  shall  remain  in  force  and  effect  so  long  as  Lessee  continues  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  said  well  or  for  drilling  or  reworking  of 
any  additional  well  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  60  consecutive  days,  and  if  they  result  in  the  production  of  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral,  so  long  thereafter  as  oil,  gas,  or 
other  mineral  is  produced  from  the  Lease  Premises,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith.  In  the  event  a  well  or  wells  producing  oil  or  gas  in  paying  quantities  should  be  brought 
in  on  adjacent  land  and  within  660'  feet  of  and  draining  the  Lease  Premises,  or  land  pooled  therewith,  Lessee  agrees  to  drill  such  offset  well  or  wells  as  a  reasonably 
prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances. 

7.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  during  or  after  the  expiration  of  this  Lease  to  remove  all  property  and  fixtures  placed  by  Lessee  on  the  Lease  Premises, 
including  the  right  to  draw  and  remove  all  casing.  When  necessary  for  utilization  of  the  surface  for  some  intended  use  by  Lessor  and  upon  request  of  Lessor  or  when 
deemed  necessary  by  Lessee  for  protection  of  the  pipeline.  Lessee  will  bury  pipelines  below  ordinary  plow  depth,  and  no  well  shall  be  drilled  within  two  hundred  (200') 
feet  of  any  residence  or  bam  now  on  the  Lease  Premises  without  Lessor's  consent. 

8.  The  rights  of  either  party  hereunder  may  be  assigned  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  the  provisions  hereof  shall  extend  to  their  heirs,  successors  and  assigns:  but  no 
change  or  division  in  ownership  of  the  land  or  royalties,  however  accomplished,  shall  operate  to  enlarge  the  obligations  or  diminish  the  rights  of  Lessee,  including,  but  not 
limited  to,  the  location  and  drilling  of  wells  and  the  measurement  of  production;  and  no  change  or  division  in  such  ownership  shall  be  binding  on  Lessee  until  forty-five 
(45)  days  after  Lessee  shall  have  been  furnished  by  registered  U.S.  mail  at  Lessee's  principal  place  of  business  with  a  certified  copy  of  recorded  instrument  or  instruments 
evidencing  same.  In  the  event  of  assignment  hereof  in  whole  or  in  part,  liability  for  breach  of  any  obligation  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  upon  the  owner  of  this  Lease 
or  of  a  portion  thereof  who  commits  such  breach.  If  six  or  more  parties  become  entitled  to  royalty  hereunder,  Lessee  may  withhold  payment  thereof  unless  and  until 
furnished  with  a  recordable  instrument  executed  by  all  such  parties  designating  an  agent  to  receive  payment  for  all. 

9.  Breach  by  Lessee  of  any  obligation  hereunder  shall  not  work  a  forfeiture  or  termination  of  this  Lease  nor  cause  a  termination  or  reversion  of  the  estate  created 
hereby  nor  be  grounds  for  cancellation  hereof  in  whole  or  in.  part.  In  the  event  Lessor  considers  that  operations  are  not  at  any  time  being  conducted  in  compliance  with  this 
Lease,  Lessor  shall  notify  Lessee  in  writing  of  the  facts  relied  upon  as  constituting  a  breach  hereof,  and  Lessee,  if  in  default,  shall  have  sixty  (60)  days  after  receipt  of  such 
notice  in  which  to  commence  compliance  with  the  obligations  imposed  by  virtue  of  this  Lease. 

10.  Lessor  hereby  warrants  and  agrees  to  defend  the  title  to  the  Lease  Premises  and  agrees  that  Lessee  at  its  option  may  discharge  any  tax,  mortgage  or  other  lien 
upon  the  Lease  Premises,  either  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  if  Lessee  does  so,  it  shall  be  subrogated  to  such  lien  with  right  to  enforce  same  and  apply  royalties  accruing 
hereunder  toward  satisfying  same.  When  required  by  state,  federal  or  other  law,  Lessee  may  withhold  taxes  with  respect  to  royalty  and  other  payments  hereunder  and  remit 
the  amounts  withheld  to  the  applicable  taxing  authority  for  the  credit  of  Lessor.  Without  impairment  of  Lessee's  rights  under  the  warranty  in  event  of  failure  of  title,  if 
Lessor  owns  an  interest  in  the  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  on,  in  or  under  the  Lease  Premises  less  than  the  entire  fee  simple  estate,  whether  or  not  this  Lease  purports  to  cover 
the  whole  or  a  fractional  interest,  the  royalties,  bonus  and  shut-in  royalties  to  be  paid  Lessor  shall  be  reduced  in  the  proportion  that  Lessor' s  interest  bears  to  the  whole  and 
undivided  fee  and  in  accordance  with  the  nature  of  the  estate  of  which  Lessor  is  seized.  Should  any  one  or  more  of  the  parties  named  above  as  Lessor  fail  to  execute  this 
Lease,  it  shall  nevertheless  be  binding  upon  the  party  or  parties  executing  same.  If  title  investigation  for  Lessee  results  in  a  reduction  or  increase  of  bonus  consideration 
payable  to  Lessor,  the  resulting  bonus  payment  shall  be  deemed  for  all  purposes  to  be  paid  to  Lessor  on  the  date  when  Lessee's  check  (in  substitution  for  any  pre-delivered 
draft)  is  delivered  to  Lessor  prior  to  its  due  date  or,  prior  to  its  due  date  is  mailed  to  LessoT  at  the  last  known  address  provided  by  Lessor. 

1 1 .  Should  Lessee  be  prevented  from  complying  with  any  express  or  implied  covenant  of  this  Lease,  from  conducting  drilling  or  reworking  operations  thereon  or 
on  land  pooled  therewith  or  from  producing  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  therefrom  or  from  land  pooled  therewith  by  reason  of  scarcity  or  of  inability  to  obtain  or  to  use 
equipment  or  material,  or  by  operation  of  force  majeure,  any  federal  or  state  law  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation  of  governmental  authority,  then  while  so  prevented, 
Lessee's  obligation  to  comply  with  such  covenant  shall  be  suspended,  and  Lessee  shall  not  be  liable  in  damages  for  failure  to  comply  therewith;  and  this  Lease  shall  be 
extended  while  and  so  long  as  Lessee  is  prevented  by  any  such  cause  from  conducting  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  or  from  producing  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  from 
the  Lease  Premises  or  land  pooled  therewith,  and  the  time  while  Lessee  is  so  prevented  shall  not  be  counted  against  Lessee,  anything  in  this  Lease  to  the  contrary 
notwithstanding. 

12.  Surface  Use  Restriction:  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,  Lessee  agrees  that  it  shall  have  no  right  to  use  the  surface  of  the 
Lease  Premises  to  exercise  any  of  the  rights  granted  hereunder  without  first  obtaining  Lessor's  written  consent.  This  provision  shall  in  no  way  restrict  Lessee's 
exploration  of  or  production  from  the  Lease  Premises  by  means  of  wells  drilled  on  other  lands  but  entering  or  bottomed  on  the  Lease  Premises.  Any  wells  directionally  or 
horizontally  drilled  or  operated  under  the  Lease  Premises  with  bottomhole  locations  (for  vertical  wells)  or  with  horizontal  drainhole  locations  (for  horizontal  wells)  on  the 
Lease  Premises  shall  be  regarded  as  if  the  wells  were  drilled  on  the  Lease  Premises.  Lessee  agrees  that  any  drilling  under  the  Lease  Premises  shall  commence  at  and 
continue  at  depths  below  five  hundred  feet  (500')  from  the  surface  of  the  earth.  In  addition  to  Lessee's  other  rights  under  this  Lease,  Lessor  hereby  grants  to  Lessee  a 
subsurface  easement  to  drill  and  operate  directional  and/or  horizontal  wells  under  and  through  the  Lease  Premises  to  reach  lands  not  covered  by  this  Lease  and  which  wells 
have  bottomhole  locations  (if  a  vertical  well)  or  horizontal  drainhole  locations  (if  a  horizontal  well)  on  lands  not  covered  by  this  Lease  or  land  pooled  therewith.  Lessee 
agrees  that  this  subsurface  easement  shall  commence  at  and  continue  at  all  depths  below  five  hundred  feet  (500')  from  the  surface  of  the  earth. 

13.  Except  as  expressly  provided  above  in  Paragraph  3,  Lessor's  royalty  may  not  be  charged  directly,  or  indirectly,  with  any  of  the  expenses  of  production, 
gathering,  dehydration,  compression,  processing,  or  treating  the  gas  produced  from  the  land  that  are  incurred  prior  to  the  inlet  of  a  gas  pipeline  evacuating  gas  from  the 
Lease  Premises.  After  delivery  at  said  inlet.  Lessor's  royalty  shall  bear  its  proportionate  share  of  all  costs  and  expenses,  including  transportation,  to  the  point  of  sale. 

14.  Each  singular  pronoun  herein  shall  include  the  plural  whenever  applicable. 

15.  For  convenience,  this  instrument  may  be  executed  in  multiple  counterparts  and  Lessor  and  Lessee  agree  that  for  recording  purposes  their  respective  signature 
page  and  acknowledgments  may  be  removed  from  their  respective  counterpart  and  attached  to  a  single  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  and  for  all  purposes  and  obligations 
hereunder  this  shall  be  considered  as  one  single  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease. 

16.  Lessor  shall,  upon  the  request  of  Lessee,  use  its  best  efforts  in  assisting  Lessee  in  obtaining  a  subordination  of  Deed  of  Trust  or  similar  security  instrument  that 
may  affect  the  Lease  Premises.  Additionally,  in  the  event  Lessor  receives  a  notice  of  default,  acceleration  of  loan,  or  notice  of  sale  under  a  Deed  of  Trust  or  other  security 
instrument  affecting  the  Lease  Premises,  Lessor  shall  immediately  provide  copies  of  any  such  notice,  and  all  additional  relevant  tacts,  to  Lessee.  In  this  regard.  Lessor 
shall  comply  with  all  reasonable  requests  of  Lessee.
