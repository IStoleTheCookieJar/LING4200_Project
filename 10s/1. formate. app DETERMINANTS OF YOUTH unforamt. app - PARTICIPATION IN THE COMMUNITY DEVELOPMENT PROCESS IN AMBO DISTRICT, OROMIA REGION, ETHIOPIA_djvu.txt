ABSTRACT 

The  study  was  undertaken  in  Ambo  district,  Ethiopia,  to  identify  the  determinants  of  youth  participation  in  the 
community  development  process  because  the  participation  of  youth  is  very  low.  This  study  used  cross-sectional  survey 
research  design.  Primary  data  were  collected  through  semi-structured  interview  schedule  from  132  youth  selected  using 
stratified  random  sampling  technique.  A  binary  logistic  regression  model  was  employed  to  identify  factors  affecting  youth 
participation.  Access  to  information,  Training  and  capacity  building,  Peer  pressure,  Parental  Influence,  Member  in  the 
cooperatives,  and  Employment  status  were  significant  factors  on  the  participation  of  youth.  Based  on  the  findings, 
the  following  recommendations  were  made:  Adequate  information  about  what  is  happening  in  their  community  should  be 
provided  to  the  youth  and  public  enlightenment  programs  should  be  organised  from  time  to  time  to  educate  the  parents  and 
the  communities  as  a  whole  on  the  significance  of  youth  participating  in  community  development  process  in  the  society.

INTRODUCTION 

Community  development  is  a  process  where  community  members  come  together  to  take  collective  action  and 
generate  solutions  to  common  problems.  Community  wellbeing  (economic,  social,  environmental  and  cultural)  often 
evolves  from  this  type  of  collective  action  being  taken  at  a  grassroots  level  (www.peernetbc.com/what-is-community- 
development).  The  community  development  process  is  a  set  of  steps  that  guide  the  identification  of  a  program  of  work  and 
movement  toward  the  ultimate  community  development  goal.  These  steps  require  the  involvement  of  community  members 
and  serve  as  a  guide  to  problem-solving,  planning,  and  completion  (Rhonda  and  Robert,  2009). 

According  to  reports  from  UN  (2015),  there  was  1.2  billion  youth  aged  between  15-24  years  globally  in  2015, 
accounting  for  one  out  of  every  six  people  worldwide.  In  Africa,  the  number  of  youth  is  growing  rapidly. 
In  2015,  226  million  youth  aged  betweenl5-24  lived  in  Africa,  accounting  for  19  per  cent  of  the  global  youth  population. 
By  2030,  it  is  projected  that  the  number  of  youth  in  Africa  will  be  increased  by  42  per  cent. 

World  Bank’s  Learning  Group  on  Participatory  Development  which  defined  participation  as  “a  process  through 
which  stakeholders’  influence  and  share  control  over  development  initiatives  and  the  decisions  and  resources  which  affect 
them”  (World  Bank,  1996).  While  Cleaver  and  Toner  (2006)  are  critical  that,  youth  participation  has  become  an  act  of  faith

in  development.  Program  and  policy  planners  need  to  better  understand  the  role  and  impact  of  youth  in  the  community 
development  process.  Youth  are  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the  development  of  their  communities 
(Brennan  et  al,  2007). 

Globally  there  is  no  commonly  accepted  definition  of  the  term  ‘youth’ .  The  definition  of  the  term  youth  seems  to 
vary  from  country  to  country  and  agency  to  agency  depending  on  country  or  agency-specific  circumstances. 
The  Federal  Democratic  Republic  of  Ethiopia  (FDRE)  during  2004  in  its  national  youth  policy  defines  youth  as  those  aged 
between  15-29  years  (www.youthpolicy.org/factsheets/country/ethiopia/). 

Ethiopia's  youth  has  the  potential  to  play  a  significant  role  in  the  country’s  socio-economic  and  political 
development.  The  FDRE  (2004)  report  on  National  Youth  Policy  recognizes  the  importance  of  youth,  “to  participate, 
in  an  organized  manner,  in  the  process  of  building  a  democratic  system,  good  governance  and  development  endeavors, 
and  benefit  fairly  from  the  outcomes”.  However,  in  practice,  there  are  many  barriers  that  hinder  youth’s  active  participation 
in  socio-economic,  political  and  cultural  life.  Several  factors  may  influence  youth  participation  in  the  community 
development  process.  Literature  cites  academic  performance  during  high  school  (Eccles  &  Barber,  1999),  greater  school 
engagement  (Lamborn  et  al.,  1992),  feelings  of  efficacy  (Sherrod  et  al, 2002),  the  need  to  be  valued  and  taken  seriously  by 
others  in  the  Community  (Flanagan  &  Van  Horn,  2001),  recognition  by  the  community  at  large  (Scales  &  Leffert,  1999), 
and  parental  involvement  (Chan  &  Elder,  1999)  as  the  most  influencing  factors  of  youth  participation.  Individual  variations 
are  presumed  to  exist  in  young  people’s  motivation  to  seek  out  and  engage  in  organized  activities.  Differences  in 
temperament,  reactivity,  and  need  for  stimulation  predispose  individuals  to  greater  and  lesser  degrees  of  interest  in  new 
experiences,  new  acquaintances,  and  group  activities  (Kagan  &  Gomez,  2014).  The  social  and  psychological  processes  that 
affect  community  participation  are  not  well  understood  (USAID,  2005). 

Therefore,  this  research  was  undertaken  in  order  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  factors  influencing  youth 
participation  in  the  community  development  process  in  the  study  area  where  the  participation  of  youth  is  very  low. 

RESEARCH  METHODOLOGY 

The  study  was  conducted  in  Ambo  district.  West  Shoa  zone,  Oromia  Regional  State,  Ethiopia.  Ambo  district  was 
purposively  selected  because  of  the  participation  of  youth  is  very  low  in  the  community  development  process 
(Ambo  district  youth  and  sports  office,  2015).  This  study  used  cross-sectional  survey  design.  The  researcher  used  both 
primary  and  secondary  sources  of  data.  Primary  data  were  collected  from  selected  youths  in  the  study  area.  Secondary  data 
were  collected  from  reports  of  different  departments  and  agencies  working  in  the  field  of  community  development. 

After  the  discussion  with  the  district  youth  and  sporst  sector/department  about  the  youth  participation  in  the 
district,  all  thirty-three  (33)  kebeles  were  ranked  into  low,  medium  and  high  on  youth  participation.  One  (1)  kebele  from 
each  low,  medium  and  high  participation  kebeles  was  selected.  Thus,  GosuQora,  Elamu  Muja,  and  Amaro  were  selected 
purposively  from  low,  medium  and  high  participation  kebeles,  respectively. 

Finally,  132sample  youth  respondents  (between  15-29  age)  were  selected  from  1,043  total  youths  in  the  selected 
three  kebeles.  The  sample  size  was  determined  by  using  the  formula  proposed  by  Kothari  (2004).

The  number  of  respondents  to  be  selected  from  each  kebele  was  decided  by  using  probability  proportional  to  size 
method  and  the  respondents  were  selected  using  stratified  random  sampling  technique  from  each  kebele  after  the  youth 
population  in  the  selected  kebeles  was  stratified  into  male  and  female. 

The  details  of  the  youths  selected  from  the  three  selected  kebeles  are  presented  in  the  Table  1.

To  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  study,  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  were  used.  Quantitative  data  were 
obtained  from  personal  interviews  with  the  selected  132  respondents.  Semi-structured  interview  schedule  was  used  to 
conduct  the  interview.  Qualitative  data  were  collected  through  focus  group  discussions  (FGD)  and  key  informant 
interviews  (KII).  In  this  study,  a  total  of  three  focus  group  discussions  were  conducted.  One  focus  group  discussion  in  each 
kebele  was  conducted.  The  participants  of  the  focus  group  discussion  were  youths  (men  and  women).  From  each  kebele, 
one  Kebele  advisory  committee  chairperson/secretary  (male  or  female),  one  woman’s  affairs  expert  (female)  and  Ambo 
woreda  youth  advisory  committee  chairperson/secretary  were  selected  as  key  informants.  Finally,  from  the  three  kebeles, 
six  (6)  different  individuals  and  one  person  from  wore  da  level  were  selected  for  key  informant  interviews. 

The  dependent  variable,  participation  in  the  community  development  process,  in  this  case,  is  a  dummy  variable 
(binary),  which  take  a  value  of  1  if  participated  and  0  for  non-participation.  However,  the  explanatory  variables  are  either 
continuous  or  discrete.  A  binary  logistic  regression  model  was  employed  to  identify  factors  affecting  youth  participation  in 
the  community  development  process.  The  logistic  regression  model  is  simpler  in  estimation  than  the  probit  model. 
Therefore,  a  binary  logistic  model  is  preferred  to  analyze  the  determinants  of  participation  of  youth. 

The  participation  in  the  community  development  process  is  therefore,  dichotomous  between  two  mutually 
exclusive  alternatives:  participated  or  not  participated.  The  probability  that  an  individual  makes  a  particular  choice  is 
influenced  by  a  vector  of  explanatory  variables.  A  particular  choice  is  made  when  the  combined  effect  of  the  vector  of  the 
explanatory  variables  reaches  the  critical  level  (breaking  point).  Thus,  a  decision  to  participate  in  the  community 
development  process  will  occur  only  when  the  combined  effect  of  the  explanatory  variables  (Xi’P)  reaches  a  certain 
unobservable  critical  value  Yi*.  So  that: 

Yi  =  1  if  Xi’P>Yi*  OR  Yi=0  if  Xi’P<Yi*  (1) 

Where  Yi*  is  a  latent  variable  and  represent  the  unobserved  level  of  participation  in  the  community  development 
process.  By  the  application  of  probability  theory,  the  probability  that  a  given  youth  participates  in  community  development 
process  is  given  by 


p  =  Prob  (Yi=l)  =  f(Xi’  P) 


(2) 


And  the  probability  that  a  given  youth  does  not  participate  in  the  community  development  process  is  given  by

1  -  p  =  Prob  (Yi=0)  =  1  -  f  (Xi’  P)  (3) 

In  this  study,  binary  log  it  is  employed  to  estimate  the  probability  of  participation  in  the  community  development 
process.  The  log  it  model  specified  for  the  study  is  stated  as 

L=  Log  [^]  =J30  +  Y_fjlXi  +  Ui  (4) 

Where:  pi  =  the  probability  that  youth  actively  participate  in  the  community  development  process,  the  binary 
variable,  pi=lfor  participant  youth  and  pi=0  for  non-participant  youth;  fjo  =  the  constant  term;  pi  =  a  vector  ofp  unknown 
coefficients  of  the  determinants  of  participation  in  community  development  process;  Xi=  a  vector  of  independent  variables 
that  determine  participation  in  community  development  process  and  includes  age,  education  and  access  to  credit  among 
others;  Ui  is  the  stochastic  error  term  and  i  =  1,  2,  3...N  observations.  The  Z  statistic  is  used  to  test  the  significance  of  the 
individual  parameters.  The  likelihood  ratio  test  (LRT)  is  employed  in  testing  the  fitness  of  the  model.  In  this  study,  the  two 
tests  were  conducted  by  using  the  SPSS  version  23. 

The  independent  variables  that  expected  to  affect  youth  participation  in  the  community  development  process  in 
the  study  area  are  presented  in  Table  2.

FINDINGS  AND  DISCUSSIONS 

Factors  Influencing  Youth  Participation  in  the  Community  Development  Process 

To  study  the  factors  influencing  youth  participation  in  the  community  development  process,  data  gathered  from 
132  youths  aged  between  15-29  years,  were  subjected  to  binary  log  it  regression  analysis.  Prior  to  the  estimation  of  the 
parameters  of  the  model,  the  data  have  been  tested  for  multi-colinearity  and  normality  problems  using  SPSS  version  23. 
Multi-colinearity  problem  arises  when  at  least  one  of  the  independent  variables  is  a  linear  combination  of  the  others. 
If  there  is  multi-co  linearity  problem:  standard  errors  are  inflated  (creates  very  large  standard  errors), 
a  sign  of  the  estimated  regression  coefficients  may  be  opposite  of  hypothesized  direction,  smaller  t-ratios  that  might  lead  to

wrong  conclusions  (Wooldridge,  2011). 

Considering  the  problem  of  multi-colinearity,  stepwise  regression  was  used  to  identify  the  relevant  independent 
variables  that  influence  the  participation  of  youths  (respondents).  Both  continuous  and  discrete  explanatory  variables  were 
cheeked  for  the  existence  of  multi -colinearity  problem. 

There  are  two  measures  often  suggested  to  test  the  presence  of  multi -co  linearity.  Variance  Inflation  Factor  (VIF) 
for  association  among  the  continuous  explanatory  variables  and  contingency  coefficient  for  dummy  variables 
(Gujarati,  2003).  The  technique  of  variance  inflation  factors  (VIF)  was  employed  to  detect  the  problem  of  multi-co 
linearity  among  the  continuous  variables. 

VIF  (X: )  =— !— 

v  u  l-Ri2 

Where!?!2  is  the  square  of  multiple  correlation  coefficients  that  result  when  one  explanatory  variables  Xt  is 
regressed  against  all  other  explanatory  variables.  The  larger  the  value  of  VIF  CX))the  more  “difficult”  or  collinear  the 
variable  Xt  is.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  if  the  VIF  values  for  continuous  variable  exceed  10,  there  is  multi-co  linearity  problem; 
whereas  very  small  (less  than  10)  indicating  the  absence  of  multi-colinearity  between  the  independent  variables. 

Similarly,  contingency  coefficients  were  computed  to  check  the  existence  of  multi-co  linearity  problem  among  the 
discrete  explanatory  variables.  The  contingency  coefficients  are  computed  as  follows: 


CC  = 


where 


CC  =  Contingency  coefficients,  x2  is  Chi-square  random  variable  and  N  represents  the  total  sample  size. 
Contingency  coefficient  values  range  between  0  and  1  and  as  a  result  of  chi-square  variable  with  the  contingency 
coefficient  below  0.75  shows  weak  association  and  value  above  0.75  indicates  the  strong  association  of  variables. 


The  decision  rule  for  contingency  coefficient  is  that  when  its  value  approaches  1,  there  is  a  problem  of  association 
between  discrete  variables.  The  contingency  coefficient  for  the  dummy  variables  included  in  the  model  was  less  than  0.75 
that  shows  multi-colinearity  is  not  a  serious  concern.  Therefore,  the  dummy  variables  were  included  in  the  model.  Hence, 
all  the  explanatory  variables  were  included  in  the  final  analysis.

Model  Summary 

Model  summary  in  logistic  regression  which  assumes  that  nonlinear  relationship  is  employed  in  the  study. R2  is 
based  on  the  log  likelihood  for  the  model  compared  to  the  log-likelihood  for  a  baseline  model  (Cox  and  Snell,  1989). 
However,  with  categorical  outcomes,  it  has  a  theoretical  maximum  value  of  less  than  1  even  for  a  perfect  model. 
In  this  study,  it  has  a  value  of. 403  which  is  less  than  1.  After  testing  the  multi -co  linearity,  all  the  twenty  variables  were 
entered  into  the  binary  logistic  regression  analysis.  The  R2  of  Binary  Logistic  Regression  is  not  that  much  accurate  as  one 
in  multi-  linear  regression.  The  Nagelkerke  R2  is. 567  in  the  present  study,  which  implied  that  56.7%  of  variation  in  the 
dependent  variable  was  explained  by  explanatory  variables  considered.  Cox  and  Snell  R2  and  Nagelkerke  R2  in  Table  6 
indicate  that  40.3%  and  56.7%  of  the  variation  in  the  dependent  variable  are  due  to  explanatory  variables,  respectively.

However,  Table  7  indicates  the  significance  of  0.000  which  means  that  it  is  statistically  significant. 
Therefore,  the  null  hypothesis  was  accepted  justifying  the  model  has  adequately  described  the  data.

Result  of  Binary  Logistic  Regression  Analysis 

Logistic  regression  analysis  was  employed  to  predict  the  probability  of  the  independent  variables  considered  as 
the  factors  of  the  youth  participation  in  the  community  development  process.  The  data  in  Table  8  shows  that  the  logistic 
regression  coefficient  results,  standard  errors,  Wald  (chi-square  test)  statistics,  associated  p-value  and  odds-ratio  (Exp(B)) 
for  each  of  the  predictors.  Accordingly,  the  statistical  significance  and  the  result  of  each  of  the  predictor  variables  were 
discussed  in  this  study.  The  Wald  statistics  is  used  to  test  the  unique  contribution  of  each  predictor.  Out  of  twenty 
variables,  six  variables  were  significant  factors  on  the  participation  of  youth  in  the  community  development  process,  while, 
the  other  variables  were  not  significant  on  the  participation  of  youth  in  the  community  development  process.  The  results  of 
binary  logistic  regression  are  presented  in  Table  8.

Determinants  of  Youth  Participation  in  the  Community  Development  9 

Process  in  Ambo  District,  Oromia  Region,  Ethiopia 


Interpretation  of  Empirical  Results 
Access  to  Information 

The  binary  model  output  confirmed  that  access  to  information  is  positive  and  statistically  significant  at  less  than 
5%  probability  level.  For  a  unit  increase  in  access  to  information  of  the  respondents,  the  odds  ratio  in  favor  of  youth 
participation  increases  by  10.769units  controlling  the  impacts  of  all  other  variables  constant.  Information  is  very  much 
essential  for  the  creation  of  knowledge.  Awareness  knowledge  precedes  how  to  do  and  principle  knowledge.  Lack  of 
access  to  information  may  result  in  a  low  level  of  awareness  among  the  youth  regarding  community  development 
activities.  This  finding  is  similar  to  the  finding  of  Akinboyeef  al.,  (2007)  that  there  was  a  significant  relationship  between 
the  youths’  occupation,  level  of  education  and  access  to  information  and  youths’  participation  in  community  development 
projects. 

Training  and  Capacity  Building 

This  variable  was  expected  to  influence  youth  participation  positively.  The  result  of  the  binary  model  shows  that, 
this  variable  is  statistically  significant  at  less  than  5  percent  probability  level.  By  controlling  the  influence  of  all  other 
variables,  a  unit  increase  in  the  training  and  capacity  building  of  the  respondents,  the  odds  ratio  in  favor  of  youth 
participation  increases  by  0.783  units.  The  finding  was  supported  by  the  report  of  the  Annual  Youth  Assembly  of  the 
United  Nations  (2010),  which  seeks  to  empower  the  youth  with  skills  and  knowledge  on:  leadership,  conflict  and  conflict 
resolution,  and  assertion  to  make  them  have  their  rights. 

Peer  Pressure 

The  result  of  the  binary  regression  model  confirms  that  there  is  a  significant  and  positive  relationship  between 
peer  pressure  and  participation  at  less  than  5%  probability  level.  According  to  the  results  of  the  model,  the  odds  of  the  ratio 
in  favor  of  youth  participation  in  the  community  development  process  increases  by  a  factor  of  0.793  for  those  who  have 
high  peer  pressure,  keeping  all  other  factors  constant.  The  result  of  this  study  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of:  Coleman’s 
early  studies  of  peer  cultures  (1961)  which  suggest  that  among  youth  in  general  and  disaffected  youth  in  particular, 
decisions  regarding  participation  in  primary  support  activities  or  extra-curricular  activities  are  heavily  influenced  by  peers 
and  Evans  (1987)  review  of  participation  in  UK  youth  organizations  cites  a  number  of  studies  confirming  the  power  of 
peer  attitudes. 

Parental  Influence 

The  result  of  the  binary  model  shows  that  the  parental  pressure  affected  the  dependent  variable  positively  and 
statistically  significant  at  less  than  5  percent  probability  level.  The  odds  ratio  in  favor  of  participation  in  the  community 
development  process  increases  by  12.470  times  controlling  the  influences  of  all  other  variables.  Study  on  parental 
influences  on  participation  in  the  community,  political  and  extra-curricular  activities,  and  church  attendance  by  Hultsman 
(2013)  suggest  that  parents  influence  participation  in  certain  activities  through  their  own  behavior  modeling.  However, 
since  parents  are  often  a  major  influence  on  the  choices  of  youth,  the  findings  of  Hultsman  (2013)and  DiacinandDeSensi 
(2013)suggests  that  a  parent’  s  prior  experience  in  various  organizational  settings  may  affect  how  they  influence  their 
children’s  participation  in  similar  settings,  other  things  being  equal.

Member  in  the  Cooperatives 

Youth  participation  is  greatly  influenced  by  membership  in  the  cooperatives.  Member  in  cooperatives  was 
hypothesized  to  have  a  positive  relationship  with  youth  participation.  The  result  of  the  binary  regression  model  confirms 
that  there  is  a  significant  and  positive  relationship  between  youth  participation  at  less  than  10%  probability  level. 
Therefore,  according  to  the  results  of  the  model,  the  odds  of  the  ratio  in  favor  of  youth  participation  increase  by  a  factor  of 
10.09  for  those  who  are  members  keeping  all  other  factors  constant.  This  finding  is  in  contradiction  with  the  finding  of 
Israel  et  al.,(\ 993)that  Community  organizations  may  be  uncertain  of  the  role  or  impact  that  youth  may  have  in  their 
efforts. 

Employment  Status 

This  variable  was  hypothesized  to  have  a  positive  relationship  with  participation.  The  result  shows  a  positive  and 
significant  relationship  at  less  than  5%  probability  level.  The  odds  ratio  in  favor  of  participation  in  the  community 
development  process  increases  by  15.730  for  those  who  are  employed  keeping  all  other  variables  constant.  This  finding  is 
in  contradiction  with  the  finding  of  Akinboyeef  al.,  (2007)  in  a  study  carried  out  in  Ogun  State  Nigeria  where  many 
educated  youths  looked  down  upon  manual  activities  or  work  engaged  by  various  rural  youth  groups. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Logistic  regression  analysis  was  employed  to  predict  the  probability  of  the  independent  variables  considered  as 
the  factors  of  the  youth  participation  in  the  community  development  process.  Out  of  twenty  variables,  six  variables  namely. 
Access  to  information.  Training  and  capacity  building.  Peer  pressure.  Parental  Influence,  Member  in  the  cooperatives, 
and  Employment  status  were  significant  factors  influencing  the  participation  of  youth  in  community  development  process. 
Based  on  the  findings,  the  following  recommendations  were  made: 

•  Youth  should  be  provided  with  entrepreneurship  training  as  the  more  business  assistance  a  young  entrepreneur 
obtains  the  better  his  or  her  awareness  on  community  participation  in  the  community  development  process. 

•  Adequate  information  to  the  youth  should  be  provided  so  that  they  will  have  first-hand  information  about  what  is 
happening  in  their  community. 

•  Public  enlightenment  programs  should  be  organized  from  time  to  time  to  educate  the  parents  and  the  communities 
as  a  whole  on  the  significance  of  youth  participating  in  the  community  development  process  in  the  society.
