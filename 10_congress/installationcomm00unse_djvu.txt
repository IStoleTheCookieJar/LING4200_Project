Initial  Response  to  Chemical,  Biological, 
Radiological,  Nuclear  and 
High-Yield  Explosive  Incidents 


DEFENSE  THREAT  REDUCTION  AGENCY 

AND  THE 

USSTRATCOM  CENTER  FOR  COMBATING  WMD 


PURPOSE  STATEMENT 


The  following  are  suggested  immediate  actions  (up  to  8  hours) 
taken  by  an  Installation  Commander  in  the  event  of  a  chemical, 
biological,  radiological,  nuclear  and/or  high-yield  explosive 
(CBRNE)  terrorist/hostile  incident  on  a  Department  of  Defense 
(DoD)  installation  in  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS). 
For  the  purposes  of  standardization  and  consistency,  it  is  general 
guidance  for  all  Services,  and  is  not  meant  to  supersede  any 
individual  Service  documents/guidance.  It  is  understood  that  many 
installations  already  have  specific  CBRNE  response/antiterrorism 
plans.  This  book  is  not  meant  to  usurp  these  plans,  but  is  instead 
general  guidance  for  those  installations  that  do  not  yet  have  plans. 
Other  DoD  and  national  guidance  CBRNE  response  documents 
should  be  considered  firstly  (please  see  reference  list).  This 
handbook  outlines  general  actions,  specifying  procedures  to  be 
carried  out  by  the  Installation  Commander  and  other  response 
personnel  in  the  case  of  each  individual  CBRNE  event. 

DISCLAIMER 

The  information  in  this  handbook  should  be  used  as  basic 
guidance.  Nothing  in  this  instruction  should  be  interpreted  to 
subsume,  replace,  detract  from,  or  conflict  with,  authorities 
and  responsibilities  of  the  Installation  Commander,  DoD,  and/ 
or  Federal,  State  and  local  leadership  specified  by  law  or  DoD 
guidance.  At  the  scene  of  any  CBRNE  incident,  circumstances 
vary  and  are  unpredictable.  Incidents  may  require  only  the  most 
rudimentary  application  of  the  suggestions  made  in  this  document, 
but  may  also  require  extremely  complex  intervention  procedures 
that  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  document.

INSTALLATION  COMMANDER’S  BASIC  RESPONSIBILITIES  IN 
THE  CASE  OF  A  CBRNE  INCIDENT  ON  THE  INSTALLATION 


INSTALLATION  COMMANDERS  SHOULD  IMMEDIATELY: 

1.  Activate  the  installation’s  initial  response  elements  and  local 
memorandums  of  understanding/memorandums  of  agreement 
(MOUs/MOAs).  MOUs/MOAs  must  be  utilized  in  order  to  make  up 
for  an  installation’s  shortfalls  and  to  detect,  deter  and  respond  to  a 
CBRNE  incident. 

2.  Initiate  the  DoD  notification  process. 

3.  Request  resources  to  augment  the  installation’s  response 
capabilities  and  notify  affected  local  personnel  on  what  protective 
measures  to  take. 

4.  Assume  overall  initial  authority.  In  accordance  with  (IAW)  DoD 
0-2000.12,  DoD  Installation  Commanders  have  responsibility 
and  authority  for  initial  response,  containment  and  resolution  of 
criminal  incidents  occurring  within  their  installation.  The  FBI  has 
coordinating  agency  responsibilities  for  investigation  and  prosecution 
of  alleged  violations  of  U.S.  Code  or  investigating  any  incidents 

that  an  Installation  Commander  declares  to  be  terrorist  in  nature 
that  occur  on  DoD  installations  or  within  DoD  facilities.  Also,  if 
needed,  Commanders  may  ask  the  FBI  for  assistance  if  the  FBI  has 
superior  tactical  assets  available,  such  as  regional  Special  Weapons 
and  Tactics  (SWAT)  teams  or  Hostage  Response  Teams  (HRT). 

The  Installation  Commander,  however,  will  at  all  times  maintain 
command  and  control  of  the  installation’s  military  assets  and 
resources. 

According  to  DoD  reference  (see  page  53  for  a  complete  listing), 
the  National  Response  Framework  (NRF)  and  the  Department  of 
Homeland  Security  (DHS)  National  Incident  Management  System 
(NIMS),  the  initial  responders  to  a  CBRNE  incident  should  immediately 
identify  and  report  the  nature  of  the  situation,  isolate  the  incident, 
and  contain  the  situation.  The  Installation  Commander  (or  the  State/ 
county  health  department  in  the  case  of  a  localized  biological  attack) 
must  oversee  these  actions  and  activate  the  installation’s  Emergency 
Operations  Center  (EOC).  Additionally,  the  Commander  should  notify 
specialized  response  forces,  and  immediately  report  the  incident  to 
the  appropriate  superior  military  command  EOC,  military  investigative 
agency,  FBI  and/or  civilian  authorities.  IAW  the  NIMS  Incident 
Command  System  (ICS),  Installation  Commanders  should  send  liaisons 
to  the  military  EOC  and  State/local  EOC  (or  Joint  Field  Office  (JFO))  and 
FBI  Joint  Operations  Center  (JOC),  as  applicable)  to  maintain  event 
cognizance  and  request  support  as  required. 


INSTALLATION  COMMANDER’S  BASIC  RESPONSIBILITIES  IN 
THE  CASE  OF  A  CBRNE  INCIDENT  ON  THE  INSTALLATION 


THE  FOLLOWING  MUST  BE  ADDRESSED  AT  THE  INSTALLATION-LEVEL: 

♦  Preserving  and  saving  lives 

♦  Preventing  human  suffering  and  preserving  health  and  safety 

♦  Securing  and  eliminating  the  hazard 

♦  Mitigating  the  incident 

♦  Protecting  critical  assets  and  infrastructure  and  preventing  further 
damage  to  the  installation  and  maintaining  public  confidence  in 
the  installation’s  ability  to  respond  to  a  terrorist/hostile  incident 

♦  Incident  reporting  to  higher  headquarters 

♦  Enforcing  security  measures  to  protect  persons  and  property 

♦  Notification  and  employment  of  select  first  and  emergency 
responders 

♦  Consider  transfer  of  critical  operations  to  secondary  location(s), 
where  applicable 

♦  Impact  of  uncontrolled  movement  of  contaminated  casualties 
(“Self-Referrals”) 

♦  Hazardous  material  (HAZMAT)  response  capabilities 

♦  Mass  warning  of  family  members,  U.S.  personnel  supporting  U.S. 
military  operations  and  allied/coalition  personnel 

♦  Notification  of  emergency-essential  military,  DoD  civilians, 
contractors  and  off-installation  medical  resources 

♦  Casualty  flow  control  at  military  treatment  facilities/clinics 

♦  Activation  of  the  EOC 

♦  Evacuation/shelter/shelter-in-place  management 

♦  Follow-on  incident  reporting  to  higher  headquarters 

♦  Establishment  of  staging  areas 

♦  Coordination  with  local  responders 

♦  Casualty  tracking 

♦  Plume  modeling 

♦  Establishment  of  mass  care  capability 

♦  Agent  confirmatory  testing 


(Concept  for  list  originally  from  CNI  3440.17(see  p.53);  additions  have  been 
made  for  further  response  assistance  by  an  Installation  Commander)

WHAT  TO  ASK  DURING  THE  RESPONSE 


♦  What  was  detected?  What  are  the  symptoms?  Was  it  a  chemical, 
biological,  radiological,  nuclear  or  high-yield  explosive  incident? 

♦  Where  was  the  explosion/release?  Are  there  any  casualties? 

♦  Did  the  explosion/release  contain  more  than  one  CBRNE 
component,  and  are  first  responders  checking  for  secondary 
devices? 

♦  Who  is  the  designated  incident  commander? 

♦  Are  there  reports  of  other  incidents,  locally,  nationally,  or  globally? 

♦  What  critical  mission  operations/facilities  are  affected? 

♦  What  critical  operations/facilities  can  be  preserved/relocated? 

♦  Will  the  incident  directly  affect  the  surrounding  community  or 
multiple  jurisdictions? 

♦  If  a  downwind  hazard  exists,  will  it  be  affected  due  to  weather?  How 
will  weather  patterns  affect  response  capabilities? 

(weather  =  wind  air/speed/direction,  rain/run-off,  temperatures) 

♦  Do  any  mutual  aid  agreements  or  MOU/MOAs  exist? 

♦  What  local,  State  and  Federal  assistance  is  available  and  what 
would  be  their  estimated  time  of  arrival  (ETA)? 

♦  What  equipment  and  protective  clothing  and  measures  will  be 
required? 

♦  What  is  the  status  of  the  work  of  the  first  responders? 

♦  Is  decontamination  a  concern?  What  medical  treatment  facilities 
are  available  for  casualties? 

♦  What  is  the  status  of  the  installation's  mission  critical  facilities  and 
critical  support  capabilities? 


SUGGESTED  INTERMEDIATE  PERSONNEL  PROTECTIVE  MEASURES 

♦  Compartmentalize  installation  to  preserve  critical  operations 

♦  Be  aware  of  secondary  device  threats  during  response  efforts  in 
rescue  area 

♦  Move  upwind  of  the  suspected  area 

♦  Cover  all  exposed  skin  surfaces  and  protect  respiratory  systems  as 
much  as  possible 

♦  Evacuate/shelter-in-place,  minimizing  passage  through 
contaminated  area 


6 


♦  Confusion,  casualties,  and  blocked  road  networks  may  interfere 
with  the  response  efforts  and  cause  a  potential  for  fear  amongst 
the  local  populace. 

♦  Infrastructure  damage  to  include  water  source  and  inability  to 
account  for  all  personnel  due  to  unknown  destruction  of  buildings/ 
roadways. 

♦  The  FBI  is  the  lead  jurisdictional  authority  for  investigation  and 
prosecution  in  the  case  of  a  terrorist  event.  Evidence  must  be 
preserved  as  much  as  possible. 

♦  DHS  may  assume  the  role  of  the  overall  incident  manager/ 
coordinator  of  consequence  management  operations  if  the  event 
is  determined  to  require  a  more  systematic  Federal  response 
coordinated  through  the  National  Response  Framework  procedures. 

♦  Press  coverage  will  begin  immediately  and  should  be  handled  by 
the  incident  Joint  Information  Center  (J  1C). 

♦  If  a  WMD-Civil  Support  Team  is  available,  it  may  be  notified  through 
the  State  for  additional  response  support  and  expertise. 

♦  There  may  be  damage  to  communications  and  electronics  systems.

(Figure  from  Joint  Pub  3-40,  Figure  IV-1) 

This  chart  from  JP  3-40  provides  a  basic  outline  of  the  most  common 
DoD  tasks  and  functions  that  must  be  addressed  during  DoD  WMD  CM 
operations.  These  tasks  and  functions  are  applicable  to  deliberate,  adaptive 
and  crisis  action  planning.  Planning  for  specific  tasks  and  functions  required 
for  a  particular  CM  mission  will  be  dependent  upon  the  nature  of  the  WMD 
material,  meteorological  conditions,  anticipated  impacted  population/area 
and  desired  end  states.  More  detailed  information  on  these  tasks  and 
functions  and  operational  contexts  can  be  found  in  Joint  Publication  3-41 
(Consequence  Management). 


Domestic  DoD  CM  operations  where  an  Installation  Commander  provides 
support  to,  or  requires  support  from,  adjoining  jurisdictions  will  be  conducted 
within  the  context  of  Defense  Support  to  Civil  Authorities  (DSCA).  The 
3025-series  of  DoD  Directives,  Instructions  and  Manuals  define  DoD  DSCA 
policy,  procedures,  and  processes  consistent  with  the  National  Response 
Framework  (NRF)  and  the  National  Incident  Management  System  (NIMS).  The 
NRF  defines  Federal  agency  responsibilities  and  response  processes  from  an 
all-hazards  approach,  which  includes  the  response  to  WMD  incidents.  The  NIMS 
provides  a  common  structure  for  command  and  control  of  response  activities, 
as  well  as  common  concepts,  principles,  and  terminology.  Pages  9  and  10  of 
this  handbook  provide  a  more  detailed  overview  of  the  NRF  and  NIMS. 


8 


THE  NATIONAL  RESPONSE  FRAMEWORK  (NRF)  AND  THE 
NATIONAL  INCIDENT  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM  (NIMS) 

DoD  response  to  a  domestic  WMD  incident  will  be  conducted  consistent 
with  the  NRF.  The  following  are  brief  excerpts  from  the  NRF  which, 
along  with  DoD  3025-series  publications,  should  be  consulted  for 
further  reference. 

The  NRF  and  the  NIMS  integrate  the  capabilities  and  resources 
of  various  governmental  jurisdictions,  incident  management  and 
emergency  response  disciplines,  nongovernmental  organizations, 
and  the  private  sector  into  a  cohesive,  coordinated,  and  seamless 
national  framework  for  domestic  incident  management.  The  NRF, 
using  the  NIMS,  is  an  all-hazards  plan  that  provides  the  structure  and 
mechanisms  for  national  level  policy  and  operational  coordination  for 
domestic  incident  management.  Consistent  with  the  model  provided  in 
the  NIMS,  the  NRF  can  be  partially  or  fully  implemented  in  the  context 
of  a  threat,  anticipation  of  a  significant  event,  or  the  response  to  a 
significant  event. 

The  NRF,  using  the  NIMS,  establishes  mechanisms  to  maximize 
prevention,  preparedness,  response,  and  recovery  integration  and 
improves  coordination  and  integration  of  Federal,  State,  local,  tribal, 
regional,  private-sector,  and  nongovernmental  organization  partners. 
The  NRF  and  the  NIMS  have  also  been  established  to  efficiently  utilize 
resources,  improve  incident  management  communications,  increase 
situational  awareness  and  facilitate  emergency  mutual  aid  and  Federal 
emergency  support  across  State,  local,  and  tribal  jurisdictions  and 
between  the  public  and  private  sectors. 

The  NIMS  is  a  system  mandated  by  HSPD-5  that  provides  a  consistent, 
nationwide  approach  for  Federal,  State,  local,  and  tribal  governments; 
the  private  sector;  and  NGOs  to  work  effectively  and  efficiently  together 
to  prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  domestic  incidents, 
regardless  of  cause,  size,  or  complexity.  To  provide  for  interoperability 
and  compatibility  among  Federal,  State,  local,  and  tribal  capabilities, 
the  NIMS  includes  a  core  set  of  concepts,  principles,  and  terminology. 
The  incident  command  system  (ICS)  forms  the  basic  structure  for 
incident  management  at  all  levels.  An  example  chart  of  the  basic  ICS 
structure,  with  an  additional  chart  of  the  Operations  section  for  a  multi- 
jurisdictional  incident,  are  provided  below. 


9 


The  ICS  employs  a  concept  of  “Unified  Command”  for  complex  incident 
management  operations  where  multiple  jurisdictions  or  agencies  have 
authority  or  for  incidents  at  multiple  locations.  Concepts  of  “command” 
and  “unity  of  command”  have  distinct  legal  and  cultural  meanings  for 
military  forces  and  operations.  For  military  forces,  command  runs  from 
the  President  to  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (SECDEF)  to  the  Commander  of 
the  combatant  command  to  the  commander  of  the  forces.  The  “Unified 
Command”  concept  utilized  by  civil  authorities  is  distinct  from  the  military 
chain  of  command. 

THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  DEFENSE  AND  THE  NRF/NIMS 

The  DoD  has  significant  resources  that  may  be  available  to  support  the 
Federal  response  when  directed  by  appropriate  national  authorities. 

The  SECDEF  shall  provide  and  authorizes  DSCA  for  domestic  incidents 
as  directed  by  the  President  or  when  consistent  with  military  readiness 
operations  and  appropriate  under  the  circumstances  and  the  law. 
Accordingly,  the  DoD  is  considered  a  cooperating  agency  to  the  majority  of 
the  NRF  Incident  Annexes  and  a  support  agency  to  all  Emergency  Support 
Functions  (ESFs)  (except  when  the  USA  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  a 


in 


primary  agency  for  ESF  #3,  Public  Works  and  Engineering).  For  additional 
information  on  DSCA,  refer  to  the  NRF  Base  Plan  and  DoD  3025-series 
publications. 

Nothing  in  the  NRF  impairs  or  otherwise  affects  the  authority  of  the 
SECDEF  over  the  DoD,  including  the  chain  of  command  for  military 
forces  from  the  President  as  Commander-in-Chief,  to  the  SECDEF,  to 
the  commander  of  military  forces,  or  any  other  military  command  and 
control  procedures.  The  SECDEF  shall  retain  command  of  military  forces 
conducting  DSCA  operations. 

The  Defense  Coordinating  Officer 

If  appointed  by  DoD,  the  DCO  serves  as  DoD’s  single  point  of  contact 
at  the  Joint  Field  Office  (JFO)  (the  temporary  Federal  organization 
established  locally  to  coordinate  operational  Federal  assistance  activities 
to  the  affected  jurisdiction(s)).  With  few  exceptions,  requests  for  DSCA 
originating  at  the  JFO  are  coordinated  with  and  processed  through 
the  DCO  consistent  with  DoD  Instruction  3025.  The  DCO  may  have  a 
Defense  Coordinating  Element  (DCE)  consisting  of  a  staff  and  military 
liaison  officers  in  order  to  facilitate  coordination  and  support  to  activated 
ESFs.  Specific  responsibilities  of  the  DCO  (subject  to  modification  based 
on  the  situation)  include  processing  requirements  for  military  support, 
forwarding  mission  assignments  to  the  appropriate  military  organizations 
through  DoD-designated  channels,  and  assigning  military  liaisons  such 
as  Emergency  Preparedness  Liaison  Officers  (EPLOs),  as  appropriate,  to 
activated  ESFs. 

Immediate  Response  Authority 

Imminently  serious  conditions  resulting  from  any  civil  emergency  may 
require  immediate  action  to  save  lives,  prevent  human  suffering,  and/or 
mitigate  property  damage.  When  such  conditions  exist  and  time  does  not 
permit  approval  from  higher  headquarters,  local  military  commanders  and 
responsible  officials  from  DoD  components  and  agencies  are  authorized 
by  DoD  directive  and  pre-approval  by  the  SECDEF,  subject  to  any 
supplemental  direction  that  may  be  provided  by  their  DoD  component,  to 
take  necessary  action  to  respond  to  requests  of  civil  authorities  consistent 
with  the  Posse  Comitatus  Act  (18  U.S.C.  §  1385).  All  such  necessary 
action  is  referred  to  as  “Immediate  Response”  and  must  be  reported 
through  the  chain-of-command  to  the  NMCC  by  the  most  expeditious  means.

CHEM/BIO/RAD  DECONTAMINATION 

IHIHH  decontamination  PRINCIPLES 

♦  For  an  effective  response  to  a  CBRNE  incident,  an  installation  must 
have,  or  have  direct  access  to,  trained  personnel  and  specialized 
equipment  with  HAZMAT  capabilities 

♦  Decontaminate: 

■  As  soon  as  possible 

■  Only  what  is  necessary 

■  As  close  to  contaminated  area  as  possible,  upwind 

■  With  mission  priority  and  health  essentials  in  mind 

♦  Wash  exposed  areas  with  soap  and  water  for  most  immediate 
decontamination  effects 

♦  Identify  readily-available  water  sources 


LEVELS  OF  PERSONAL  PROTECTIVE  EQUIPMENT  (PPE) 

From  the  Office  of  Occupational  Safety  and  Health,  U.S.  Department  of  Labor  and  the  Environmental 

Protection  Agency  standards  and  guidance 

Level  A 

To  be  selected  when  the  greatest  level  of  skin,  respiratory,  and  eye 
protection  is  required.  These  fully  encapsulating  suits  afford  protection 
against  petroleum  products  and  halogenated  hydrocarbons,  as  well  as 
against  nerve  and  blister  agents.  Self-contained  breathing  apparatuses 
(SCBAs),  totally-encapsulating  chemical-protective  suits,  coveralls, 
safety  boots/shoes,  safety  glasses  and/or  chemical  splash  goggles  are 
recommended. 

Level  B 

To  be  selected  when  the  highest  level  of  respiratory  protection  is  necessary 
but  a  lesser  level  of  skin  protection  is  needed.  Liquid  splash-protective 
suits,  pressure-demand,  full  face-piece  SCBAs,  inner  chemical-resistant 
gloves  and  safety  boots,  and  hard  hats  are  recommended. 

Level  C 

To  be  selected  when  the  concentration(s)  and  type(s)  of  airborne 
substance(s)  are  known  and  the  criteria  for  using  air  purifying  respirators 
are  met.  Support  function  protective  garments,  full  face-piece,  air-purifying, 
canister-equipped  respirators,  chemical  resistant  gloves  and  safety  boots, 
and  hard  hats  are  recommended. 

Level  D 

A  work  uniform  may  be  selected  affording  minimal  protection:  used  for 
nuisance  contamination  only.  Coveralls,  safety  boots/shoes,  safety  glasses 
or  chemical  splash  goggles  are  recommended.  Use  Level  D  protection 
when  no  danger  of  chemical  exposure  exists.  Current  recommendations  for 
PPE  to  be  used  in  situations  of  radiation  contamination  suggest  only  Level 

D  type  protection  plus  a  dust  filter  for  respiratory  protection.

please  see  FM  3-1 1 .21 ,  Appendix  C 

CONSIDERATIONS  WHEN  DEALING  WITH  MASS  DECONTAMINATION 

♦  Isolation  of  contaminated  victims  within  certain  areas,  or  medical 
facilities,  if  available. 

♦  Quarantines  to  restrict  movement  of  personnel  (and  animals)  in 
specific  areas  of  the  installation. 

♦  Notification  of  affected  public  off-installation. 

♦  Proper  PPE  at  all  times  according  to  installation/DoD  standards 
and  requirements. 

♦  Proper  handling  procedures  for  deceased  collaborated  with 
Mortuary  Affairs  and  the  State  Medical  Examiners  Office. 


CHEM/BIO/RAD  DECONTAMINATION 

IMPORTANT  ACTIONS 


♦  Provide  concise  information  on  the  threat,  recommendations  on 
what  should  be  done  to  combat  it,  and  instructions  on  handling 
victims  to  all  hospitals,  clinics,  nursing  homes,  home  health  care 
agencies,  individual  physicians,  pharmacies,  school  nursing  staffs, 
and  other  medical  providers 

♦  Initiate  MOUs/MOAs  for  civilian  medical  assistance  as  the  majority 
of  installations  have  limited  medical  care  expertise;  the  local  health 
department  or  state  public  health  region  field  office  will  typically 
take  the  lead  in  coordinating  the  local  medical  response  when 
installation  assets  are  overwhelmed 

♦  In  most  instances,  respirators,  M40/MCU-2P  masks,  or  adequate 
levels  of  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  will  be  required 

♦  Removal  of  outer  clothing  &  rapid  washing  of  exposed  skin  generally 
removes  90%  of  contamination 

♦  Use  caution  when  removing  clothing  from  burned  patients  to 
prevent  aggravation  &  further  contamination  of  wounds 

♦  Run-off  may  be  contaminated,  as  will  any  used  materials  (wound 
dressings,  protective  gear,  etc.),  and  should  be  collected  in  a 
protected  location  for  disposal 

♦  Take  care  moving  injured  personnel  to  avoid  re-contamination  of 
clean  individuals 


SAMPLE  OF  A  PERSONNEL  DECONTAMINATION-STATION  LAYOUT 


17 


CHEMICAL  DECONTAMINATION 


♦  Respirator,  M40/MCU-2P  masks,  or  adequate  levels  of  PPE  are 
required 

♦  A  clean  treatment  area  should  be  established  immediately 

♦  Mild  soap  and  hot  water  can  be  used  to  remove  most,  if  not  all,  of 
the  agent/gross  contamination 

♦  A  diluted  bleach  solution  (1  part  bleach,  200  parts  water)  may  be 
used  for  more  complete  skin  decontamination 

♦  Antidotes,  when  available,  should  be  administered  in  the 
contaminated  areas,  if  possible  (i.e.  Nerve  Agent  Antidote  Kits 
(NAAK)) 

♦  Ensure  medical  responders,  transport  units,  and  receiving  medical 
facilities  are  properly  protected  against  secondary  contamination 

♦  Use  Level  A  PPE  if  substance  is  unknown  and  move  up  equipment 
level  as  required  by  agent  effects 

♦  Know  an  immediately  available  water  source 

♦  Run-off  needs  to  be  contained 

♦  Review  procedures  for  storage  and  disposal  of  contaminated 
materials 

♦  Consider  replacement  of  clothes 


BIOLOGICAL  DECONTAMINATION 

i . . . .  i  ISSUES 

♦  Respirator,  M40/MCU-2P  masks,  or  adequate  levels  of  PPE 
are  required 

♦  Inhalation  is  the  most  likely  and  largest  area  of  concern  for 
biological  agents 

♦  Scrubbing  exposed  area  with  mild  soap  and  water  is  often 
sufficient  to  avert  contact  spread  of  agent  -  note  that  runoff  will  be 
contaminated 

♦  Replacement  of  contaminated  clothing  with  clean  clothing 

♦  Undiluted  household  bleach  may  assist  in  clothing  and  equipment 
decontamination  (with  30  minutes  of  contact  time  and  a  solution 
of  1  part  bleach,  100  parts  water)  and  skin  decontamination 

(1  part  bleach,  200  parts  water) 


RADIOLOGICAL  DECONTAMINATION 


l-  .... 


ISSUES 


.4 


♦  Respirator,  M40/MCU-2P  masks,  or  adequate  levels  of  PPE  are 
required 

♦  Radioactive  contamination  continues  to  irradiate  nearby  living 
things 

♦  Contaminated  patients  do  not  present  an  immediate  irradiation 
hazard  to  medical  personnel  with  normal  protection;  following 
decontamination,  they  are  no  longer  hazardous 

♦  Decontamination  should  occur  before  arrival  at  installation  medical 
facilities,  but  definitive  medical  health  care  should  not  be  withheld 
for  decontamination  purposes 

♦  Most  external  radioactive  contamination  can  be  eliminated  by  the 
removal  of  clothing 

♦  If  the  casualty  has  surface  contamination  and  no  physical  injuries, 
washing  with  soap  and  water  provides  effective  decontamination 

♦  If  a  contaminated  casualty  has  substantial  physical  injuries,  the 
casualty  should  be  stabilized  before  decontamination  is  performed 

♦  Be  sure  skin  is  washed  thoroughly,  but  GENTLY  -  abrasions  on  the 
skin  will  lead  to  internal  contamination 

♦  A  living  patient  cannot  be  so  radiologically  contaminated  as  to 
present  an  acute  hazard  to  medical  personnel;  life/limb-saving 
medical  attention  should  never  be  delayed  because  of  the 
presence  of  radioactive  material  or  contamination

RADIOLOGICAL  CASUALTY  DECONTAMINATION 


The  following  diagram  from  AFRRI’s  Medical  Management  of 
Radiological  Casualties  Handbook  shows  a  setup  for  casualty  reception 
in  a  contaminated  environment.  The  actual  setup  of  this  area  may  vary 
depending  on  assets  and  circumstances. 


CHEMICAL  INCIDENT 

INDICATIONS  OF  A  CHEMICAL  INCIDENT 


♦  May  not  be  easily  detectable  by  senses 

♦  Chemical  cloud  may  exist;  unusual  number  of  dead  or  dying 
animals  or  insects  in  the  area 

♦  Unexplained  odors  (smell  of  bitter  almonds,  peach  pits,  newly 
mown  hay,  or  green  grass);  some  agents  may  be  odorless 

♦  Unusual  liquid  or  unauthorized  spraying  in  the  area;  agents  may  be 
released  as  tiny  droplets,  similar  to  the  release  of  an  insecticide 

♦  Often  large  numbers  of  victims  display  a  sudden  onset  of  symptoms 
of  nausea,  difficulty  breathing,  convulsions,  disorientation,  or 
patterns  of  illness  inconsistent  with  natural  disease 

♦  Low-lying  clouds  or  fog  unrelated  to  weather;  clouds  of  dust;  or 
suspended,  possibly  colored,  particles 

♦  The  effect  of  a  chemical  agent  depends  on  its  concentration  and 
type;  smaller  doses  of  the  agent  may  or  may  not  kill 

♦  Some  chemical  agents  are  heavier  than  air,  consequently  when 
sheltering-in-place,  remain  out  of  low-lying  areas,  such  as  ditches 
or  ravines

(From  JP  3-11) 


The  hazards  from  a  chemical  strike  may  last  for  less  than  an  hour  or 
for  several  weeks.  The  effects  on  personnel  may  be  immediate.  For 
units  forced  into  high  levels  of  protection,  missions  will  take  longer  to 
perform.  A  summary  of  chemical  weapon  effects  for  persistent  and 
nonpersistent  agents  is  shown  on  the  next  page.

BIOLOGICAL  INCIDENT 

INDICATIONS  OF  A  BIOLOGICAL  INCIDENT 

♦  Primary  care  physicians,  hospitals,  pharmacies  &  EMS 
providers  will  begin  to  notice  off-season  symptoms  (similar  to  a  flu 
outbreak  to  include  symptoms  like  unexplained  gastrointestinal 
illnesses  and  upper  respiratory  problems);  careful  to  note  that 
symptoms  may  occur  during  on-season  as  well 

♦  Potential  lag-time  between  employment  and  on-set  of  symptoms 
(except  for  fast-acting  agents,  e.g.,  ricin) 

♦  Most  biological  agents  have  incubation  period  of  1-7  days  before 
on-set  of  symptoms,  thus  potential  for  widespread  contamination 
through  affected  personnel  is  great;  detection  will  occur  several 
hours/days/weeks  after  original  dissemination 

♦  Evidence  of  a  disease  that  is  unusual  or  does  not  occur  naturally  in 
a  given  area  or  manifestation  of  multiple  disease  symptoms  in  the 
same  patients;  indicates  mixed  agents 

♦  Large  numbers  of  military  and  civilian  casualties  may  be  affected 
within  a  geographic  area 

♦  Data  suggesting  an  outbreak  from  a  definitive  source 

♦  Large  die-off  in  multiple  species  of  animals 

♦  Absence  of  a  natural  cause  for  the  outbreak 

♦  Biological  agents  can  be  classified  as  pathogens  or  toxins.  Human 
pathogens  are  defined  as  organisms  that  cause  disease  in  man. 
Pathogens  include  bacteria,  rickettsia,  fungi,  and  viruses.  Naturally 
occurring  toxins  are  non-living  byproducts  of  cellular  processes  that 
can  be  lethal  or  highly  incapacitating.  Page  32  provides  a  synopsis 
of  several  potential  biological  agents  and  their  ranges  of  effects

MORE  BIOLOGICAL  INDICATIONS  AND  INFORMATION 


METHODS  OF  DISPERSAL 

1)  Airborne  via  liquid  droplets/aerosolized  spray  -  hard  to  detect 
and  is  effective  in  covering  large  areas  with  minimal  amounts  of 
agent  and  equipment 

2)  Blood/body  fluids 

3)  Food  and  water  source  introduction 

4)  Infected  animal  (vector)  release 

5)  Dry  powders  (for  example,  via  the  postal  system) 

IMPORTANT  TO  NOTE 

♦  May  result  in  high  mortality  rates  and  have  the  potential  for  major 
public  health  impact,  as  well  as  cause  public  panic  and  social 
disruption 

♦  Requires  special  action  for  public  health  preparedness 

♦  Time  required  before  symptoms  are  observed  is  dependent  on  the 
agent  used  and  the  dose  received 

♦  Most  important  is  to  identify  an  unfolding  event  early  and  be  able  to 
screen  personnel  rapidly  and  distribute  antidotes  effectively 

♦  Best  protection  is  hand-washing,  masks  and  shelter-in-place 

♦  There  will  be  a  need  for  an  early  decision  to  quarantine;  coordinate 
with  local  department  of  health 

♦  On-installation  in-patient  medical  facility  will  need  surge/storage 
isolation  facility 

♦  Agent  can  be  identified  with  100%  accuracy  only  in  a  lab;  results 
may  be  available  within  24  -  48  hours 

♦  Timely  identification  and  communication  of  the  attack  is  essential 
in  treating  and  controlling  the  disease  and  limiting  the  effect  on 
personnel 

♦  Preventive  medicine  specialists  shall  be  required  to  assist 
Commanders  with  identifying  safe  food  and  water  sources  in 
determining  when  to  use  treatment,  immunization,  and  other 
preventative  measures

RADIOLOGICAL  INCIDENT 

INDICATIONS  OF  A  RADIOLOGICAL  INCIDENT 

*  According  to  AFRRI’s  Medical  Management 
of  Radiological  Casualties  Handbook: 

♦  Material  dispersed  can  originate  from  any  location  using 
radioactive  sources  (nuclear  waste  processors,  nuclear  power 
plants,  university  research  facilities,  medical  radiotherapy  clinics,  or 
industrial  complexes) 

♦  Exposure  may  be  known/recognized  or  clandestine  through: 

■  Large  recognized  exposures,  such  as  radiological  dispersal 
devices  (any  device  that  causes  the  purposeful  dissemination  of 
radioactive  material  across  an  area  without  a  nuclear  detonation;  a 
radioactive  source  is  blown  up  using  conventional  explosives  and  is 
scattered  across  the  targeted  area  as  debris) 

■  Small  radiation  source  emitting  continuous  gamma  radiation 
producing  group  or  individual  chronic  intermittent  exposures 
(such  as  radiological  sources  from  medical  treatment  devices  or 
environmental  water  or  food  pollution) 

♦  Exposure  may  result  from  one  or  any  combination  of  the  following: 

■  External  (such  as  skin  contamination  with  a  radioactive  material) 

■  Internal  (absorbed,  inhaled,  or  ingested  radioactive  material) 

♦  Conventional  explosion:  will  cause  injury  from  the  physical  effects 
of  the  blast  (debris  scattered  from  explosion)  in  addition  to  the 
radiation  and  heavy-metal  hazard  inherent  in  many  radioactive 
materials 

♦  Psychological  effects:  severity  will  depend  on  the  nature  of  the 
material  and  method  of  deployment;  number  of  casualties  from  blast 
and  a  more  frantic  situation  will  intensify  stress  among  personnel 

Intermittent/Chronic  Exposure  Symptoms: 

♦  Headache,  fatigue,  weakness 

♦  Anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea 

♦  Partial  and  full  thickness  skin  damage,  hair  loss,  ulceration 

♦  Low  white  blood  cell  count,  a  decrease  in  blood  platelets,  skin 
hemorrhaging,  opportunistic  infections 

Specific  Symptoms  of  Concern,  especially  with  a  2-3  week  prior 
history  of  nausea  and  vomiting: 

♦  Thermal  burn-like  skin  effects  without  documented  thermal  exposure 

♦  Immunological  dysfunction  with  secondary  infections 

♦  A  tendency  to  bleed  (nose,  gums) 

♦  Decreased  ability  for  blood  clotting 


IN  THE  EVENT  OF  A  RADIOLOGICAL  INCIDENT 
CONTACT  THE  NATIONAL  MILITARY  COMMAND  CENTER  (NMCC) 
(703)  692-2387  (24  HOURS  /  7  DAYS  A  WEEK)

IMPORTANT  INFORMATION  ON  RADIOLOGICAL  DISPERAL 


According  to  DoD  Concept  of  Operations  for  CBRNE  Defense 

Supporting  US  Military  Installation  and  Facility  Preparedness: 

♦  Low-level  radiological  material  is  available  from  a  large  number  of 
industrial  sources  worldwide. 

♦  Terrorists  able  to  gain  access  to  this  material  could  exploit  it  using 
explosive  devices  (or  devices  such  as  aerial  sprayers  or  hidden 
stationary  sources). 

♦  Specific  examples  of  terrorist/hostile  radiological  hazards  include 
iridium,  cobalt,  cesium,  and  highly  enriched  uranium  (HEU)  as  the 
core  of  a  radiological  dispersal  device. 

♦  Although  rarely  lethal  in  the  near-term,  the  deliberate 
dissemination  of  radioactive  matter  can  cause  considerable 
immediate  psychological  harm.  At  moderate  dosages,  exposed 
personnel  could  also  experience  delayed  effects  or  might  develop 
cancer  decades  later. 

Treatment  Considerations  (from  AFRRI’s  Medical  Management  of 

Radiological  Casualties  Handbook): 

♦  If  trauma  is  present,  treat 

♦  If  external  radioactive  contaminants  are  present,  decontaminate 

♦  If  radioiodine  (reactor  accident)  is  present,  consider  giving 
prophylactic  potassium  iodide  (Lugol’s  Solution)  within  first  24 
hours  only  (ineffective  later) 

Decontamination  Considerations  (from  AFRRI’s  Medical  Management  of 

Radiological  Casualties  Handbook): 

♦  Exposure  without  contamination  requires  no  decontamination 
(Radiation  Safety  Officer  (RSO)  measurement) 

♦  Exposure  with  contamination  requires  Universal  Precautions, 
removal  of  patient  clothing,  and  decontamination  with  water 

♦  For  internal  contamination,  contact  RSO  and/or  nuclear  medicine 
physician 

♦  Treating  contaminated  patients  before  decontamination  may 
contaminate  the  facility;  plan  for  decontamination  before  arrival 

♦  Patient  with  life-threatening  condition:  treat,  then  decontaminate 

♦  Patient  with  non-life-threatening  condition:  decontaminate,  then 
treat

INDICATIONS  OF  A  NUCLEAR  INCIDENT 


A.4 

Blast:  Increased  pressure  and  strong  winds  collapse  buildings 
and  displace  objects;  crushes,  deforms,  tumbles,  shocks,  creates 
projectile  missiles  and  obstacles;  flying  debris  and  blast  will  cause 
physical  injury 

Thermal  Radiation:  Intense  heat  burns  and  starts  fires  and  will  cause 
eye  damage 

Nuclear  Radiation:  Causes  immediate  or  delayed  radiation  sickness 
and  may  cause  death  within  close  proximity  of  detonation  (personnel 
affected  will  depend  on  size  of  weapon),  increases  disease  and  non¬ 
battle  injury,  material  and  terrain  contamination;  neutrons  and  gamma 
rays  produced  during  the  first  minute,  but  fallout  may  last  for  years 
Radiation  Sickness:  Severe  radiation  sickness  resulting  from  external 
irradiation  and  its  consequent  organ  effects  is  a  primary  medical 
concern;  when  appropriate  medical  care  is  not  provided,  the  median 
lethal  dose  of  radiation,  the  LD50/60  (that  which  will  kill  50%  of  the 
exposed  persons  within  a  period  of  60  days),  is  estimated  to  be  3.5 
grays  of  absorbed  radiation 

Electromagnetic  Pulse:  Causes  permanent  or  temporary  impairment 
of  electrical,  electro-optical,  and  electronic  equipment  and

HIGH-YIELD  EXPLOSIVE  (HE)  INCIDENT 

INDICATIONS  OF  A  HIGH-YIELD  EXPLOSIVE  INCIDENT 


Heat  and  Fires:  Intense  heat  from  explosion  will  cause  burns  and 
start  fires 

Blast  Pressure  Effect  (most  powerful  of  all  explosive  effects): 

Expanding  gases  exert  extreme  pressure  on  atmosphere  surrounding 
point  of  detonation;  pressure  and  strong  winds  collapse  buildings  and 
displace  objects  in  the  case  of  a  very  large  explosion 

Fragmentation  Effect:  Debris  and  fragmentation  are  produced  by 
the  explosive  container,  objects  around  the  detonation  point  and  the 
intended  target 

Thermal  Effect:  High  explosives  produce  higher  temperatures  for  a 
shorter  time;  effect  is  seen  usually  as  a  bright  flash  at  the  moment  of 
detonation;  a  fireball  is  more  likely  to  cause  a  secondary  fire  than  a 
high-yield  explosive  detonation 

Ground  and  Water  Shock:  Occurs  when  an  explosive  is  initiated 
while  buried  in  the  earth  or  submerged  under  water  -  may  cause 
substantially  greater  damage 

Blast  and  Flying  Debris:  Will  cause  the  most  physical  injury  and 
casualties 

Weakened  and  Collapsed  Buildings:  Will  create  hazardous  areas 

Disorientation  and  Mental  Trauma:  For  those  at  or  close  to  the 
detonation  site 


Ensure  FIRST  RESPONDERS  are  aware  during  RESPONSE  and 
RECOVERY  MISSIONS  of  SECONDARY  DEVICE  THREATS;  If  there 
is  any  indication  of  a  SECONDARY  CHEMICAL,  BIOLOGICAL,  OR 
RADIOLOGICAL  (CBR)  DEVICE  attached  to  a  HIGH-EXPLOSIVE 
INCIDENT,  Turn  to  the  suggested  CBR  INITIAL  RESPONSE  ACTIONS

OPREP-3  PINNACLE  REPORT 


FROM  FM  3-11.21: 


According  to  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Manual  3150.03, 
the  installation  will  submit  an  operations  report  (0PREP)-3  in  the  event 
of  a  terrorist  WMD  incident  directly  to  the  NMCC.  The  goal  is  to  make 
initial  voice  reports  within  15  minutes  of  an  incident,  with  message 
reports  submitted  within  1  hour  of  the  incident.  The  initial  report 
must  not  be  delayed  to  gain  additional  information.  Follow-up  reports 
can  be  submitted  as  additional  information  becomes  available. 

The  installation  will  submit  voice  reports  sequentially  to  the  NMCC, 
appropriate  Commanders,  and  the  reporting  unit’s  parent  service 
and  intermediate  superior  command.  Conference  calls  or  concurrent 
telephone  calls  should  be  considered  if  no  delays  are  encountered 
and  security  can  be  maintained.  There  will  remain  an  open  line 
between  the  NMCC  and  the  installation  throughout  the  duration  of 
the  incident.  All  OPREP-3  will  be  submitted  as  soon  as  possible  after 
an  event  or  incident  has  occurred  and  sent  at  FLASH  or  IMMEDIATE 
precedence.  Message  Address:  JOINT  STAFF  WASHINGTON  DC//J3 
NMCC//.
