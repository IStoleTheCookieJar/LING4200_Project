INTRODUCTION 


The  literature  of  lawn  tennis  is  yearly  expanding  as  the  game 
continues  to  grow  in  popular  favor,  and  it  would  require  a  bulky 
volume  indeed  to  include  all  of  the  valuable  matter  that  might 
be  found  within  this  book.  For  the  sake  of  convenience,  there- 
fore, it  has  been  considered  best  to  include  here  only  the  matter 
which  rightly  belongs  in  an  Annual.  The  contents,  as  a  glance 
will  show,  include  a  most  complete  review  of  the  tournaments 
and  happenings  of  the  past  year  in  the  game,  with  full  revised 
rules  and  regulations  and  detailed  instructions  for  managing  tour- 
naments, handicapping,  etc.  The  pages  are  profusely  illustrated, 
too,  with  portraits  of  the  champions  from  all  sections  of  the 
country,  north,  east,  south,  and  west,  and  some  of  the  foreign 
experts,  as  well  as  views  of  the  famous  matches  of  the  season, 
championship  courts,  etc. 

If  the  reader  would  begin  at  the  beginning  and  learn  to  play 
the  game,  he  will  find  the  instructions  he  needs,  from  the  first 
principles  of  the  game  to  technical  instruction  for  even  the 
tournament  players,  in  "How  to  Play  Lawn  Tennis,"  by  J. 
Parmly  Paret,  which  appears  in  Spalding's  Athletic  Library  (No. 
157;  price  ten  cents).  These  two  handy  little  books  together 
comprise  a  complete  library  on  the  game,  and  an  inquiry  to  the 
American  Sports  Publishing  Company's  Bureau  of  Information, 
16  Park  Place,  New  York,  will  furnish  any  additional  informa- 
tion that  might  not  be  found  within  the  two  volumes. 


SPALDING  S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 


REVIEW  OF  LAST  SEASON 

To  American  lovers  of  lawn  tennis,  the  season  of  1902  was 
one  of  almost  complete  satisfaction.  The  absence  of  interna- 
tional matches  during  the  previous  year  was  a  disappointment, 
but  the  Englishmen  were  not  blamed  for  their  inability  to  send 
over  a  visiting  team  in  fulfillment  of  their  challenge.  It  was 
particularly  welcome,  however,  when  the  third  challenge  was 
issued  at  the  beginning  of  last  season,  and  still  more  so  when  the 
expected  team  was  found  to  include  the  famous  Doherty  broth- 
ers, whose  world-wide  reputation  had  preceded  them.  With 
such  a  formidable  array  against  them,  the  success  of  the  Ameri- 
can players  was  very  gratifying,  and  when  it  was  repeated  m  the 
singles  at  Newport  two  weeks  after  the  International  matches 
at  Bay  Ridge,  the  American  satisfaction  at  the  outcome  of  the 
campaign  was  tinged  only  by  the  defeat  of  Davis  and  Ward  in 
the  American  championship  doubles. 

Whatever  doubts  may  have  existed  as  to  the  question  of  In- 
ternational supremacy  after  the  defeat  of  Gore's  team  in  1900 
were  dispelled  last  season  when  the  peerless  English  champions 
were  beaten  in  such  a  decisive  fashion.  Almost  any  way  you 
look  at  it,  you  will  find  the  result  a  clean-cut  victory  for  the 
American  players  in  the  singles,  although  the  individual  superior- 
ity of  the  Doherty  brothers  in  doubles  was  fully  proven  by  their 
victories  on  this  side  of  the  water.  The  distinguished  visitors 
beat  Davis  and  Ward,  our  National  champions  in  doubles,  both 
in  the  International  matches  at  Bay  Ridge  and  at  Newport, 
and  they  also  scored  over  the  Wrenn  brothers  in  the  finals  of 
the  Eastern  championship  at  Longwood.  Still  another  victory 
to  their  credit  at  the  end  of  the  American  campaign  was  the 
defeat  of  Larned  and  Whitman  in  the  final  round  of  the  doubles 
at  Southampton. 

In  these  four  matches,  the  Dohertys  lost  only  two  sets  and 
won  twelve.  As  their  opponents  in  each  case  were  the  strongest 
of  the  American  representatives,  their  almost  unbroken  success 
narrow  margin.  At  Longwood,  the  Wrenns  won  the  first  set 
easily  and  were  within  a  point  or  two  of  securing  a  lead  that 
gives  them  unquestioned  claim  to  superiority.  Yet  in  at  least 
two  of  these  matches,  the  victory  was  secured  only  by  a  very 
seemed  almost  certain  to  bring  victory;  while  in  the  Dohertys 
first  encounter  with  Davis  and  Ward  at  Bay  Ridge,  the  American 
champions  were  again  on  the  verge  of  securing  a  similar  advan- 


10  SPALDING  S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

tage.  In  every  double  match  where  the  Englishmen  were  seen 
on  this  side  of  the  ocean,  their  superiority  over  our  home  players 
was  most  marked  by  their  clever  method  of  conserving  their 
energies.  Davis  and  Ward,  the  Wrenn  brothers,  as  well  as 
Collins  and  Waidner,  all  secured  the  advantage  at  the  beginning, 
but  in  every  case,  the  Americans  tired  first  and  the  Britishers 
were  so  much  stronger  at  the  end  of  the  match  that  their  advan- 
tage was  easily  carried  home  to  victory.  It  was  truly  marvelous 
to  see  these  imperturbable  Englishmen  keep  steadily  at  their 
work,  even  though  their  brilliant  American  opponents  clearly 
outplayed  them  at  the  start;  and  when  the  visitors  were  so  far 
behind  that  their  chances  seemed  to  be  fading,  their  play  was 
the  coolest  and  strongest  they  showed  at  any  time,  and  in  each 
case,  they  were  in  much  better  condition  at  the  end. 

In  the  singles,  however,  it  was  a  different  story.  When  one 
analyzes  closely  the  result  of  the  International  matches,  it  is 
clear  that  the  visitors  had  a  narrow  escape  from  a  more  over- 
whelming defeat  than  that  which  was  scored  against  them.  On 
the  first  day's  play  at  Bay  Ridge,  before  the  rain  interrupted  the 
matches,  there  seemed  to  be  only  oi^e  side  in  the  hunt.  Whitman 
had  taken  the  first  two  sets  from  Pim  by  6/i,  6/i,  and  Larned 
had  beaten  R.  F.  Doherty  by  ()lz,  6/2.  Even  the  visitors  con- 
ceded that  if  no  interruption  had  stopped  the  play  as  it  was 
progressing  then,  the  challengers  had  small  chance  of  winning 
a  set  in  either  of  these  first  two  matches.  As  it  was,  they  failed 
to  get  a  single  set  in  either  of  the  other  two  matches,  for  Whit- 
man beat  Doherty  and  Larned  beat  Pim  the  second  day  each  in 
straight  sets.  Providing  then,  that  the  first  round  had  resulted 
as  all  seemed  to  expect  it  would  have  done,  the  challengers 
would  not  have  scored  a  single  set  in  all  four  of  the  matches. 
Such  a  defeat  as  this  would  have  been  almost  too  crushing  for 
explanation. 

As  it  was,  Doherty  managed  to  turn  the  tables  on  Larned 
the  following  morning  in  the  completion  of  their  interrupted 
match,  but  Pim  was  clearly  outclassed  by  both  of  the  American 
representatives  in  the  Internationals.  His  lack  of  form  was 
emphasized  still  more  by  his  later  play,  for  Larned  again  won  in 
straight  sets  from  him  in  the  finals  at  Southampton,  and  Ware 
put  him  out  of  the  championship  struggle  at  Newport. 

It  was  unfortunate  that  the  Americans  did  not  have  an  oppor- 
tunity of  seeing  H.  L.  Doherty  against  any  of  our  first-class 
players,  for  his  only  single  matches  of  importance  on  this  side 
of  the  ocean  were  against  Richard  Stevens,  Clarence  Hobart  and 
L.  E.  Ware,  and  none  of  these  three  held  any  claim  to  first-class 
form.    Even  at  home  it  is  a  much-vexed  question  whether  the 


12  SPALDING  S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

younger  Doherty  is  as  good  or  better  than  his  brother,  for  they 
never  play  against  each  other  in  pubHc  and  few  opportunities 
for  direct  comparison  have  been  had  within  the  last  two  or  three 
seasons  since  H.  L.  became  so  good. 

With  Pirn  clearly  outclassed  and  H.  L.  Doherty  an  unknown 
quantity,  the  skill  of  the  challengers  as  compared  with  the  best 
of  the  American  champions  rests  entirely  on  the  form  shown  by 
R.  F.  Doherty  over  here.  Curiously  enough,  the  Englishman 
played  each  of  our  two  representative  men,  Larned  and  Whit- 
man, two  matches.  At  Bay  Ridge,  Whitman  beat  Doherty  three 
straight  sets,  while  at  Newport,  this  result  was  exactly  reversed ; 
against  Larned,  the  Englishmen  won  an  extremely  close  match 
in  the  Internationals  and  lost  two  weeks  later  at  Newport  by 
almost  as  narrow  a  margin. 

By  still  another  curious  coincidence,  Doherty  was  exhausted 
from  having  played  Larned  when  he  lost  to  Whitman,  and  from 
having  played  Whitman  at  Newport  when  he  lost  to  Larned. 
In  each  of  these  important  tournaments,  the  visitor  carried  the 
whole  brunt  of  the  defense,  and  in  each  he  had  to  meet  the  best 
two  American  experts  on  successive  days.  Under  such  circum- 
stances, it  is  not  surprising  that  he  did  not  win  from  both  in 
either  tournament. 

But  the  Davis  challenge  Cup  and  the  International  Champion- 
ship for  1902  were  fairly  won  by  the  American  representatives 
and  their  success  has  now  become  a  matter  of  history.  Whether 
we  shall  be  able  to  hold  this  emblem  of  superiority  or  not  is 
quite  another  question.  The  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association 
has  challenged  for  another  series  of  International  matches  this 
season,  and  a  third  attempt  to  "lift"  the  Davis  Cup  will  be 
made  this  summer.  The  week  of  August  3  has  been  selected  as 
the  date  for  holding  the  matches,  and  the  Longwood  Cricket 
Club  of  Boston  as  the  scene  of  the  struggle. 

While  it  is  too  early  yet  to  know  with  any  certainty  who  the 
challengers  will  send  to  America,  there  seems  little  doubt  that 
the  Doherty  brothers  will  be  on  the  team.  Rumor  has  it  that 
S.  H.  Smith  and  F.  L.  R'iseley  will  accompany  the  visitors  of 
last  year,  and  it  is  a  sure  thing  that  Pirn  will  not  be  sent  again. 
In  any  case,  the  added  experience  of  one  season  on  American 
courts  will  help  the  chances  of  the  challengers,  if  the  Dohertys 
are  among  them,  and  our  representatives  will  have  this  summer 
a  still  harder  task  on  their  hands  than  last  year.  For  the  defence 
of  the  cup,  Larned  and  Whitman,  Beals  Wright  and  the  Wrenn 
brothers,  and  probably  also  Davis  and  Ward  will  all  be  available, 
as  well  as  much  other  promising  material  which  may  develop 
championship  form.    American  chances  are  at  least  as  bright  as 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  13 

they  were  a  year  ago,  and  many  Americans  will  be  disappointed 
if  the  Davis  Clip  is  not  found  as  safe  in  the  fall  as  the  America's 
Cup,  when  Sir  Thomas  Lipton's  Shamrock  III.  sails  for  home 
again. 

Among  the  American  players  and  tournaments  last  season, 
there  were  a  number  of  interesting  features  aside  from  the 
International  play  of  the  year.  The  success  of  the  leading 
second-class  players  and  their  individual  improvement  in  several 
cases  were  exceptionally  welcome  since  the  ranks  of  the  "cracks" 
have  long  needed  recruits.  W.  J.  Clothier,  Holcombe  Ward  and 
Kriegh  Collins,  all  showed  notable  improvement  during  the  year, 
and  any  of  these  three  may  furnish  championship  material  before 
another  season  has  passed  into  history.  Harry  F.  Allen,  of 
Philadelphia,  Reuben  Hunt,  of  California,  and  Chauncey  Seaver 
and  Edgar  Leonard,  of  Boston,  are  also  promising  recruits  for 
the  second  class.  All  of  which  is  an  improvement  in  the  outlook 
over  the  prospects  of  last  year  or  the  season  before. 

Am6ng  the  women  players,  the  leading  champions  did  not  last 
year  show  the  decided  superiority  over  their  nearest  rivals 
which  has  been  the  case  in  previous  seasons.  It  is  only  a  few 
years  ago  that  the  championship  class  among  the  women  num- 
bered only  two  or  three  players,  and  the  rest  of  the  field  were 
completely  outclassed  by  these  leaders.  Last  season,  however, 
there  were  Miss  Marion  Jones.  Miss  Elizabeth  Moore,  Miss 
Juliette  Atkinson,  Miss  Winona  Closterman,  Miss  Louise  Pound, 
Miss  Marie  Wimer,  Miss  Myrtle  McAteer,  Miss  Carrie  Neely, 
and  Miss  E.  Stockton,  all  of  whom  showed  play  at  times  that 
was  fully  up  to  the  championship  standard.  If  we  only  had  more 
open  tournaments  on  this  side  of  the  ocean,  there  is  little  doubt 
that  our  leading  women  players  would  soon  be  fully  capable  of 
meeting  the  English  girls  on  level  terms.  Women's  events  might 
then  be  added  to  the  international  program  each  year.

THE  OFFICIAL  RANKING  FOR  1902 

The  Ranking  Committee  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn 
Tennis  Association  was  composed  of  Richard  Stevens,  chairman, 
Beals  C.  Wright  and  Lyle  E.  Mahan.  This  committee  reported 
to  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A.,  who  held 
a  meeting  in  New  York  in  October  to  hear  anyone  who  wanted 
to  submit  any  facts  regarding  the  relative  skill  of  the  players. 
The  ranking  was  then  accepted  by  the  Executive  Committee,  and 
published  as  official,  after  which  it  was  again  passed  upon  by 
the  Association  at  large  in  its  annual  meeting  in  February,  the 
list  being  accepted  as  reported. 

Although  no  ranking  for  women  players  was  added,  the  doubles 
teams  were  ranked  again,  a  few  of  them,  as  started  last  year, 
and  thirty-one  players  in  singles  were  classified,  against  thirty- 
five  the  season  before.     The  full  official  lists  follow :

INTERNATIONAL  CHAMPIONSHIPS  OF  1902 


United  States  of  America  vs.  Great  Britain. 

The  second  series  of  matches  for  the  international  Champion- 
ship and  the  Davis  Challenge  Cup  was  held  on  the  grounds  of 
the  Crescent  Athletic  Club,  Bay  Ridge,  New  York,  August  6,  7 
and  8.  The  result  was  a  victory  for  the  American  defenders  of 
the  title  and  trophy,  but  only  by  the  narrow  margin  of  three 
rr^atches  to  two.  The  challenging  team,  composed  of  R.  F. 
Doherty,  H.  L.  Dohertv  and  Dr.  Joshua  Pirn,  accompanied  by 
their  team  captain,  W.  H.  Collins,  the  President  of  the  English 
Lawn  Tennis  Association,  arrived  on  the  Crescent  grounds  two 
days  before  the  matches  were  to  open  and  practiced  steadily 
among  themselves  in  preparation  for  the  big  matches. 

The  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  nomi- 
nated W.  A.  Larned  and  M.  D.  Whitman  for  the  singles,  and 
Holcombe  Ward  and  D.  F.  Davis  for  the  doubles,  as  the  defend- 
ers. Under  the  International  regulations,  the  challengers  were 
not  required  to  declare  in  advance  which  of  their  players  would 
be  used  in  the  singles  and  which  in  the  doubles,  because  only 
three  of  their  candidates  had  been  named.  The  day  before  the 
play  actually  began.  Captain  Collins  announced  that  R.  F.  Do- 
herty and  Dr.  Pim  would  play  in  the  singles  and  the  Doherty 
brothers  in  the  doubles.  The  drawings  resulted  in  this  order 
for  the  first  day:  Whitman  vs.  Pim,  and  Larned  vs.  Doherty; 
the  players  exchanging  opponents  for  the  second  day. 

The  weather  was  very  unfavorable  on  the  first  day,  and  a 
heavy  thunderstorm  interrupted  the  play  at  a  most  critical  point. 
Whitman  had  won  two  easy  sets  from  Pim  before  the  shower 
flooded  the  court,  and  Larned  finished  off  a  second  victorious 
set  with  Doherty  in  the  middle  of  the  downfall.  The  captains 
of  the  opposing  teams  agreed  to  resume  the  unfinished  matches 
the  following  morning  and  to^continue  the  original  schedule  as 
planned  in  the  afternoon  of  the  second  day.  This  plan  was 
followed  out  and  Whitman  succeeded  in  beating  Pim  after  having 
lost  the  third  set,  but  Larned  lost  three  straight  sets  to  Doherty, 
losing  the  other  first-round  match  to  the  challengers. 

In  the  afternoon,  the  second  round  of  the  singles  was  played 
and  the  Americans  scored  a  most  decided  victory.  Larned  beat 
Pim  three  straight   sets  and  Whitman  clinched  the  victory  for 


SPALDING  S   LAWN   TENNIS    ANNUAL.  21 

the  American  side  by  beating  Doherty  also  in  straight  sets  after 
a  rather  exciting  finish.  With  the  Davis  Cup  already  won  and 
the  result  of  the  series  settled,  there  was  no  lessening  in  the 
interest,  and  over  six  thousand  spectators  turned  out  the  third 
day  to  see  Davis  and  Ward  meet  Doherty  brothers  in  the 
doubles.  This  match  proved  to  be  a  wonderful  exhibition  of 
scientific  lawn  tennis  and  provoked  a  greater  show  of  enthusiasm 
than  any  other  play  of  its  kind  within  many  years.  The  Ameri- 
can pair  held  a  good  lead  at  the  start,  but  the  wonderful  reserve 
power  of  the  Doherty  brothers  gradually  overcame  the  greater 
brilliance  of  the  Americans'  strokes  and  finally  wore  down  the 
defenders,  the  visitors  winning  in  four  brilliant  sets. 
Comments  on  the  matches  follow: 

Whitman   vs.  Pirn. 

The  first  of  the  matches  to  be  finished  was  that  between  Whit- 
man and  Pim,  and  the  American  won  it  by  the  score  of  6/i,  6/i, 
l/6,  6/0.  Whitman  was  very  cautious  at  first,  for  he  was  mindful 
of  Pim's  reputation  as  a  past-master  of  brilliant*  play.  The  vis- 
itor, however,  soon  showed  that  his  strokes  lacked  the  killing 
power  they  had  when  he  was  in  America  seven  years  before. 
Pim  showed  all  the  ease  and  grace  of  stroke  he  used  to  have, 
but  he  did  not  seem  to  be  able  to  get  around  the  court  so  well. 
His  strokes  were  low  and  fast  and  genercTlly  well  directed,  if  he 
met  the  ball  in  good  position  to  play  it.  But  when  he  had  to 
run  any  distance  to  get  to  the  ball  his  stroke  lacked  much  of 
its  severity  and  frequently  sailed  out  of  court  or  into  the  net. 
He  drove  a  wonderful  number  of  balls  a  few  feet  over  the  base- 
lines, but  he  kept  on  trying  for  the  most  difficult  aces,  despite 
his  many  failures.  His  volleying  was  very  accurate  when  he  did 
get  up  to  the  net,  but  he  was  more  frequently  caught  only  half- 
way up,  and  forced  to  volley  low  defensively,  instead  of  turning 
his  stroke  into  a  weapon  of  attack. 

Whitman  crouched  low,  using  well-bent  knees  as  he  always 
does,  and  seemed  wonderfully  active,  always  quick  to  reach  the 
ball  and  painstaking  and  cautious  in  his  return  of  it.  Pim  used 
perfect  length  most  of  the  time,  but  Whitman  preferred  to  cut 
off  his  strokes  much  shorter,  placing  the  ball  from  side  to  side 
for  the  opening  he  wanted  to  kill.  After  the  first  few  games 
the  American  ventured  to  the  net  occasionally  and  generally 
with  good  success.  He  did  not  hit  as  hard  overhead  as  he  has 
often  done  before,  and  seemed  to  favor  caution,  even  in  smash- 
ing, to  taking  any  big  risks.

R.  F.  Doherty  vs.  Larned. 

Although  started  at  the  same  time  as  the  Whitman-Pim  match, 
it  was  long  after  that  when  the  match  between  R.  F.  Doherty  and 
Larned  was  finished.  The  match  began  early  Wednesday  after- 
noon, and  from  the  first  it  was  apparent  that  the  American  was  in 
rare  form.  He  hit  the  ball  as  cleanly  and  as  freely  as  at  his 
best,  and  his  accuracy,  length  and  speed  were  as  good  as  he  has 
ever  shown.  His  passing  strokes  were  cut  off  shorter  and 
dropped  sooner  after  crossing  the  net  than  those  of  his  British 
adversary,  and  his  speed  was  noticeably  better.  His  chief  point 
of  superiority,  however,  lay  in  his  volleying.  He  ran  in  on  his 
service  regularly,  and  so  well  did  he  volley  that  he  kept  Doherty 
constantly  in  trouble  from  the  moment  he  got  the  first  ball  on  his 
racket  until  he  killed  it. 

Nearly  all  of  his  placing,  whether  on  the  volley  or  off  the 
ground,  was  at  sharp  angles,  and  once  at  the  net,  he  had  Doherty 
running  about  from  side  to  side  of  his  court.  The  American  hit 
the  lines  repeatedly  so  accurate  were  his  returns,  and  as  so  often 
before  when  has  been  playing  a  winning  game,  all  of  the  luck 
came  in  Larned's  favor.  The  Englishman's  play  suffered  a  good 
deal  by  comparison,  but  in  no  particular  so  much  as  in  the  lack 
of  speed  and  offensive  power  of  his  returns.  He  let  the  ball  come 
so  high  over  the  net  that  Larned  had  little  difficulty  in  going  to 
it,  and  once  there,  it  offered  easy  chances  for  killing  strokes. 
Doherty's  lack  of  lobbing  was  also  a  subject  for  criticism,  for 
Larned  was  repeatedly  in  so  close  to  the  net  that  an  overhead 
attack  must  have  sent  him  scuttling  back  to  the  base-line. 

Unfortunately  for  the  American,  the  rain  fell  in  torrents  just 
as  he  was  finishing  his  second  set,  and  with  everything  in  his 
favor,  the  match  was  postponed  until  the  morning.  When  it  was 
resumed  again  the  tables  were  turned  completely.     Doherty  had 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  23 

improved  marvelously  over  night.  The  dry  court  and  the  sun- 
shine seemed  to  bring  back  much  of  his  latent  skill  and  he  played 
with  more  confidence  and  far  greater  speed  By  some  who  re- 
membered Larned's  remarkable  record  in  i^^^^^tional  matches, 
the  American  champion  was  accused  of  having  suddenly  con- 
tracted a  case  of  "cold  feet,"  but  there  was  little  or  no  truth  in 
the  accusation  that  he  lost  his  nerve.

Larned  vs.  Pim. 

The  original  programme  for  the  afternoon  of  the  second  day, 
Larned  vs^  Pim  and  Whitman  vs.  K.  F  Doherty,  was  not  altered 
because  the  unfinished  matches  of  the  day  before  were  completed

were  glad  to  learn  from  those  who  were  in  closest  touch  with 
the  players  that  the  American  champion  had  not  lost  his  confi- 
dence because  of  his  disheartening  defeat  of  the  morning.  His 
play  cerLinly  gave  no  evidence  of  lack  of  self-confidence.  Larned 
unquestionably  put  up  a  much  faster  game  than  against  Doherty 
hiTe  morning^nd  Pim's  style  found  him  just  in  his  element. 
The  challenge?  was  steadier  and  a  bit  faster  than  agamst  Whit- 
man yet  fared  even  worse.  Larned  was  opposed  by  a  straight 
low,' fast  ball  with  plenty  of  impact,  and  he  was  always  sure  of 
his  play  with  this  kind  of  strokes  against  him.  In  this  match 
there  was  the  hardest  hitting  of  the  tournament,  and  Larned 
showed  the  most  brilliant  passing  of  the  week.  ^^,u^a 

There  was  less  strategy,  less  variation  of  the  pace  and  method

of  attack,  but  always  the  most  brilliant  of  fast  strokes.  Pirn 
simply  played  right  into  the  hands  of  the  American  and  never 
had  a  chance  to  win.  Larned  was  exceptionally  fine  m  his  cross 
court  passes,  and  again  and  again  he  brought  off  the  cleanest  aces 
by  crossing  Pirn  when  the  latter  came  up  in  his  court  behmd 
strokes  that  would  ordinarily  be  good  for  points  in  themselves. 
With  the  Britisher  back  in  his  court,  Larned  frequently  took  the 
bit  in  his  teeth  and  driving  deep  into  one  corner  or  another  came 
up  to  kill  Pim's  return  on  the  volley.  His  strokes  were  so  well 
timed,  so  deep,  and  so  aggressive  that  there  was  seldom  much 
chance  for  the  visitor  to  get  away  a  clean  return  that  would  get 
him -out  of  difficulty.

Whitman  vs.  R.  F.  Doherty. 

The  whole  outcome  of  the  international  matches  and  posses- 
sion of  the  Davis  Cup  for  1902  hung  on  the  Whitman-R.  F. 
Doherty  match,  although  this  fact  was  not  realized  at  the  trnie, 
for  it  was  generally  expected  that  the  American  pair  would  still 
win  the  doubles  the  next  day,  even  if  Whitman  lost  to  Doherty 
in  the  singles.  r    ,       1 

Whitman  was  clearly  the  better  player  on  the  form  of  the  day, 
although  there  were  many  who  were  not  convinced  that  the 
American  possessed  any  clear  superiority  over  his  English  rival. 
Whitman  never  showed  the  speed  of  his  adversary,  nor  the 
Englishman's  skill  at  underhand  volleying  and  half-volleymg, 
but  in  nearly  every  other  particular  he  was  a  shade  better  than 
Doherty.  The  American  did  not  miss  the  low  volleying  or  half- 
volleying,  for  he  kept  better  position  in  court  and  carefully 
avoided  being  caught  where  either  stroke  was  often  needed. 
Speed  against  him  was  of  little  advantage,  and  Doherty  declared 
after  the  match  that  he  thought  Whitman  played  better  against 
speed  than  slower  play,  and  that  he  intentionally  slacked  off  in 
his  pace  because  he  thought  the  additional  speed  did  not  help 
him  at  all.

There  was  a  marked  contrast  in  the  service,  for  the  Enghsh- 
man  used  a  long  straight  delivery  that  forced  his  adversary  well 
out  of  court,  biit  came  up  so  regularly  that  Whitman  did  not 
find  it  difficult  to  handle.  On  the  other  hand.  Whitman  varied 
his  service  between  the  slow  straight  delivery  that  seemed  to 
simply  get  the  ball  safely  over  the  net  without  a  high  bound, 
and  the  reverse  twist  delivery  that  has  created  so  much  comment. 
At  first  the  twist  service  seemed  to  be  a  stumbling  block  for 
Doherty,  but  the  American  used  it  more  than  usual,  as  it  seemed 
so  profitable,  and  later  in  the  match  the  visitor  began  to  hit  it 
with  more  confidence  and  better  results. 

Both  ran  in  on  the  service  a  good  deal.  Whitman,  if  anything, 
more  than  Doherty  and  closer,  and  each  answered  this  kind  of 
attack  in  the  same  way,  by  dropping  the  first  return  short  more 
often  than  risking  a  clean,  fast  pass.  Each  lobbed  a  good  deal 
and  in  this  play  they  seemed  to  be  fairly  equal,  as  in  the  answer- 
ing stroke,  neither  killing  many  deep  lobs,  but  both  finishing  all 
of  the  short  ones  with  few  errors.  It  was  Whitman's  closer  net 
position  and  sharper  angles,  both  in  volleying  at  the  net  and  in 
attacking  with  the  ground  strokes,  that  seemed  to  give  him  the 
victory.  The  match  was  closer,  however,  than  the  score  indi- 
cates, and  a  stroke  or  two  reversed  in  the  second  set  might  have 
turned  the  match,  although  the  American  won  in  straight  sets. 

The  score  of  the  match  by  points  follows:

Doherty  brothers  vs.  Ward  and  Davis. 

-  Although  the  international  championship  for  the  season  had 
already  been  won  and  lost  in  the  singles  there  was  as  much 
interest  in  the  doubles  as  though  the  whole  contest  hung  on  this 
one  match.  The  big  inclosure  reserved  for  two  courts  on  the" 
first  two  days  had  been  turned  into  one  space  for  the  doubles 
and  no  spectators  were  allowed  within  many,  many  yards  of 
the  court.  The  great  hollow  square  was  surrounded  with  some 
five  thousand  enthusiasts,  sitting  or  standing,  and  there  was 
much  enthusiasm. 


28  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

The  match  was  closer  than  the  score  indicates,  and  it  all  seemed 
to  hang  on  the  outcome  of  the  second  set.  The  Americans  were 
the  stronger  at  first  and  seemed  to  hold  matters  well  in  hand. 
Their  advantage  waned  steadily,  however,  and  although  they 
held  a  good  lead  in  the  second  set  after  winning  the  first,  they 
were  unable  to  hold  it  in  the  long  deuce  struggle  that  followed. 

Davis  was  the  turning-point  on  which  the  whole  match  hung 
and  it  was  he  who  nearly  won  the  victory  and  who  earned  the 
defeat  that  finally  came.  He  was  a  whirlwind  at  first  and  his 
smashing  of  lobs  and  his  terrific  twist  services  were  terrors  to 
the  Britishers.  Davis  held  himself  in  check  a  good  deal  in  hand- 
ling deep  lobs  and  did  not  waste  as  many  points  as  he  often  does 
in  trying  to  kill  deep  balls  that  other  men  volley  with  less  speed, 
but  toward  the  end  of  the  match  he  missed  a  good  many  short 
volleys  and  low  lobs,  putting  them  into  the  net  in  trying  to  kill 
them. 

Davis's  service  was  like  a  hurricane  and  during  the  first 
half  of  the  match,  when  he  was  scoring  with  his  first  ball,  it 
wrought  havoc  with  the  defence  of  his  antagonist.  H.  L,  Doherty 
handled  the  long,  twisting  balls  with  fairly  good  success,  but  the 
twist  puzzled  the  older  brother  and  he  jiiissed  many  of  these 
deliveries.  Aside  from  the  failures  of  his  opponents  to  return 
many  of  his  terrific  services,  when  they  reached  them,  Davis  also 
served  a  great  many  clean  aces.  Ward's  service  was  always  a 
power  for  his  side. 

Ward  and  H.  L.  Doherty  were  the  wheel-horses,  doing  the 
lion's  share  of  the  work,  and  getting  little  applause  and  making 
only  a  small  percentage  of  the  killing  strokes.  Ward  was  a  mar- 
vel of  steadiness ;  but  he  evidently  was  less  feared  on  the  other 
side  of  the  net  than  his  partner,  for  even  when  Davis  was  very 
tired  in  the  second  set  the  Englishmen  lobbed  more  to  Ward 
than  to  Davis.  When  Davis  began  to  give  out  toward  the  end 
of  the  match  Ward  was  a  great  support,  and  he  worked  like  a 
beaver  to  stem  the  tide.  On  the  other  side  of  the  net  R.  F. 
Doherty  made  nearly  all  of  the  killing  strokes  and  also  most 
of  the  errors.  H.  L.  Doherty  was  very  sure  in  all  his  strokes, 
but  his  return  of  the  service  was  his  best  point. 

All  in  all,  the  Dohertys  used  more  of  the  American  style  of 
play  than  any  previous  team  of  foreigners  on  this  side  of  the 
Atlantic.  Two  or  three  novelties  were  tried  in  the  match.  Tn 
the  second  set  Davis  and  Ward  tried  running  in  under  high  lobs, 
but  the  wind  made  it  impossible  to  lob  as  high  as  is  necessary  to 
make  this  maneuver  successful  and  only  once  or  twice  did  the 
Americans  get  settled  at  the  net  in  time  to  volley  the  smash  of 
their   opponents.     The   Dohertys   tried   the   English   method    of

playing  with  the  partner  of  the  striker-out  at  the  service  Hne,  but 
it  did  not  last  long,  for  this  position  was  shown  to  be  untenable.

BRITISH  INTERNATIONAL  REPORTS 


Report  of  the  Team  Captain. 

To  the  Council  of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association. 

Gentlemen  :  I,  the  undersigned,  appointed  to  captain  the 
British  Isles  Team  against  the  United  States  of  America,  1902, 
beg  to  issue  my  report  as  follows : 

The  selection  committee  nominated  Dr.  J.  Pirn  and  Messrs. 
R.  F.  and  H.  L.  Doherty,  from  whom  the  team  was  to  be 
chosen. 

The  Doherty  Brothers  and  I  arrived  in  New  York  by  the 
"Luciana"  on  July  26th,  and  were  met  by  Messrs.  Powers  and 
Richards,  representing  the  Crescent  Athletic  Club,  and  Mr. 
Brown,  representing  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club.  Mr.  Brown, 
after  showing  us  every  kindness  and  courtesy  in  New  York,  took 
us  through  to  Boston,  where  we  were  met  by  Messrs.  Presbrey 
and  Lyman.  We  dined  with  Mr.  Presbrey  at  the  University 
Club,  at  which  we  were  to  stay  during  the  week  of  the  Longwood 
Tournament. 

On  the  following  day  we  were  taken  by  Mr.  Charles  Hayden 
on  his  steam  yacht  to  Nahant.  On  board  we  met  Messrs.  Davis, 
Ward,  Ware,  Presbrey,  Horton,  Codman,  and  other  prominent 
players  and  officials.  The  Brothers  Doherty  played  a  couple  of 
sets,  and  did  not  play  at  all  badly  considering  the  voyage.  ^ 

Our  object  in  going  to  Longwood  was  to  get  practice  in  the 
Singles,  and  to  qualify,  if  might  be,  for  the  final  of  the  Champion- 
ship Doubles  at  Newport.  , 

Mr.  H.  L.  Doherty  retired  from  the  Singles  after  winning  three 
rounds,  3/1,  3/1,  3/0,  and  Mr.  K.  F.  Doherty  retired  after  beat- 
ing Mr.  Wright,  3/0,  and  with  the  score  in  his  favor  against 
Mr.  R.  Stevens,  6/3,  4/1.  Had  the  Brothers  Doherty  not  retired 
in  the  Singles,  they  might,  one  or  other  of  them,  have  had  to  play 
two  hard  matches  on  both  Friday  and  Saturday,  or  have  been 
compelled  to  retire  in  the  final  or  challenge  match  of  the  Singles. 
As  they  had  had  sufficient  practice  in  the  Singles,  it  was  thought 
wiser  to  retire  early  rather  than  late  in  the  Competition.  I  find 
among  my  notes  the  following  paragraph :  "What  the  Press  will 
have  to  say  to-morrow  is  none  of  our  business.  This,  at  any  rate, 
is  true  without  doubtâ the  Press  is  not  inspired  by  the  players. 
We  have  had  absolutely  fair  treatment  in  every  way  from  Com- 


32  SPALDING  S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

mittee  and  players."  With  my  present  experience,  I  can  un- 
hesitatingly add  ''and  from  the  Press  also." 

On  Thursday,  July  31st,  after  the  Doherty  Brothers  had  won 
the  second  round  of  the  Doubles,  we  went  for  a  change  of  air 
to  the  Eastern  Yacht  Club,  as  guests  of  two  prominent  members, 
who  made  our  visit  very  delightful,  and  returned  next  morning 
on  Mr.  Hayden's  yacht.  The  Doherty  Brothers  won  their  match 
against  Messrs.  Larned  and  Ware,  3/1,  and  next  day  the  final 
against  the  Wrenn  Brothers,  3/1,  after  losing  the  first  set,  and 
being  within  a  stroke  of  losing  the  second.  There^  were  2,800 
present  for  the  final  of  the  Doubles.  They  were  enthusiastic,  but 
fair  in  their  applause. 

After  the  Doubles  on  Saturday,  August  2d,  the  player?  gave 
us  a  dinner  at  the  Country  Club,  Brookline,  with  Mr.  Lyman 
in  the  chair,  and  as  I  stated  then,  I  state  again  now â that  the 
differences  in  conditions  of  play  in  America  and  England  are  so 
slight,  that  any  player  of  experience  could  get  accustomed  to 
them  with  two  days'  practice. 

We  left  Boston  by  the  midnight  train  on  the  night  of  the 
dinner,  with  much  regret,  and  arrived  in  New  York,  again  under 
Mr.  Brown's  care,  at  seven  on  Sunday  morning.  We  were  met 
at  the  Racquet  Club  by  Mr.  Richards  and  two  other  members 
of  the  Crescent  Athletic  Club,  and  went  by  steamer  to  Bay  Ridge, 
where  the  International  Match  was  to  be  played,  and  where  we 
met  Dr.  Pim,  who  had  arrived  on  the  previous  afternoon,  and 
had  had  practice  on  the  Courts. 

On  the  day  of  our  arrival.  Dr.  Pim  had  practice  with  both  of 
the  Doherty  Brothers,  and  was  playing  well,  considering  he  had 
just  come  off  a  voyage.  On  Monday  he  played  six  sets,  and  was 
playing  very  well. 

On  Tuesday  I  nominated  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty  and  Dr.  Pim  for 
the  Singles,  against  Messrs.  Whitman  and  Larned,  on  Wednes- 
day and  Thursday,  August  6th  and  7th,  keeping  Mr.  H.  L. 
Doherty  fresh  for  the  Doubles  with  his  brother  against  Messrs. 
Davis  and  Ward,  on  Friday,  August  8th. 

By  the  conditions  of  the  Competition,  the  Committee  of  Man- 
agement decides  upon  the  order  of  play  in  Singles  and  Doubles. 
Their  original  idea  was  to  play  the  Doubles  on  the  middle  day, 
but  an  accident  to  Mr.  Davis  necessitated  an  alteration,  I  am 
glad  to  be  able  to  report  that  Mr.  Davis  was  quite  well  when  the 
Doubles  match  was  played. 

On  the  Wednesday,  Mr.  Whitman  won  two  sets,  6/1,  6/1,  from 
Dr.  Pim,  and  Mr.  Larned,  two  from  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty,  6/2,  6/3, 
when  a  heavy  thunderstorm  stopped  play. 

Then  came  the  question  of  when  the  postponed  matches  should 


34  SPALDINGS   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

be  played,  and  it  was  finally  unanimously  decided  by  all  concerned 
that  it  would  be  fair  to  all  the  players  to  finish  the  uncompleted 
matches  on  the  Thursday  morning,  beginning  at  lo  :30,  and  to 
let  the  rest  of  the  programme  stand  as  announced. 

In  the  morning  Dr.  Pirn  started  by  winning  the  first  set,  6/i, 
but  lost  the  next  6/0,  and  the  match  3/1.  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty  won 
three  straight  sets,  6/3,  6/4,  6/4,  and  the  match  3/2. 

With  regard  to  the  remaining  Single  matches,  I  find  the  fol- 
lowing note  made  at  the  time â "In  the  afternoon  our  men  were 
unable  to  win  a  set,  though  Mr,  R.  F.  Doherty's  match  was  closer 
than  the  score  indicates.  My  impression  is  that  the  better  side 
won.  All  four  men  were  very  fit  and  well,  and  the  conditions 
perfect."  The  Americans  thus  won  three  out  of  the  four  Sin- 
gles, and  therefore  the  Competition,  leaving  the  Doubles  only  to 
be  played. 

On  the  Friday,  Messrs.  Davis  and  Ward  won  the  first  set,  dl'^, 
and  the  Doherty  Brothers  the  next  three,  10/8,  6/3,  6/4.  It  is 
worthy  of  note  that  in  the  46  games  played,  the  servers  lost  only 
8;  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty,  one;  Mr.  Davis  and  Mr.  H.  L.  Doherty, 
two  each ;    and  Mr.  Ward,  three. 

Over  5,000  people  passed  through  the  gate  on  Wednesday,  over 
6,000  on  Thursday,  and  over  10,000  for  the  Doubles  on  Friday. 
The  enthusiasm  was  immense,  but  unbiased.  The  three  Courts 
used  at  the  Crescent  Athletic  Club  could  not  have  been  better, 
and  all  the  arrangements  made  by  the  Committee,  under  Mr. 
W.  F.  Powers,  were  of  a  very  high  order.  I  can  think  of  nothing 
that  could  have  been  done  by  the  Committee  that  would  have 
furthered  our  chances  of  success.  During  our  stay  at  Bay  Ridge, 
we  met  with  tmiversal  kindness  and  courtesy,  and  the  President, 
Mr.  Ford,  and  the  Chairman  of  the  House  Committee,  were  ever 
at  hand  to  see  that  our  every  want  was  supplied. 

The  British  Team  was  in  strict  training  from  the  time  of  leav- 
ing home  until  our  defeat  in  the  Inter-National  Match,  and,  as 
far  as  I  know,  afterwards. 

The  full  score  is  as  follows: 
Mr.   M.   D.   Whitman    (A.)    beat   Dr.  J.    Pim    (B.I.),  6/1,   6/1, 

1/6,  6/0.

America  beat  the  British  Isles  by  3  matches  to  2,  12  sets  to  7, 

and  100  games  to  74, 
Mr.  Richard  Stevens  was  Referee  and  Mr.  M.  D.  Whitman  was 
Captain  of  America. 

On  Saturday  we  left  Bay  Ridge  for  Southampton,  Long  Island, 
where  the  members  of  the  team  had  been  invited  to  play  in  an 
Invitation  Tournament  at  the  Meadow  Club  as  a  preparation  for 
the  Championship  at  Newport.  During  our  stay  in  Southampton, 
we  were  the  guests  of  Judge  and  Mrs.  H.  E.  Rowland,  and 
nothing  could  exceed  the  kindness  and  consideration  which  we 
received  from  them,  their  party,  and  their  friends. 

Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty  and  Mr.  H.  L.  Doherty  retired  in  the  semi- 
finals of  the  Singles,  and  Mr.  Larned  beat  Dr.  Pim  in  the  final 
3/0  after  Dr.  Pim  had  beaten  Mr.  R.  Stevens  set-less. 

In  the  Doubles,  Mr.  Whitman  and  Mr.  Larned  beat  Dr.  Pim 
and  Mr.  O.  Campbell  after  the  latter  had  been  three  times  within 
a  stroke  of  the  match.  The  Doherty  Brothers  in  the  final  beat 
Messrs.  Whitman  and  Larned  one,  and  the  Messrs  Doherty 
none. 

In  the  Ladies'  and  Gentlemen's  Doubles,  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty  and 
partner  beat  Mr.  H.  L.  Doherty  and  partner  in  the  final. 

Knowing  of  the  difficulties  of  the  journey  from  Southampton 
to  Newport,  where  the  Championships  were  to  be  played.  Colonel 
Thompson,  a  friend  of  Judge  Rowland's,  took  us,  together  with 
Messrs.  Whitman  and  Larned  and  others  in  his  yacht,  "Lady 
Torfeida."  We  arrived  at  Newport  on  Sunday  night,  when  the 
Doherty  Brothers  left  us,  to  stay  on  the  yacht  of  their  friend 
Mr.  Higgins,  the  rest  of  the  party  remaining  on  board  until 
Monday. 

On  Tuesday  morning  the  Doherty  Brothers,  winners  of  the 
Eastern  Doubles  at  Longwood,  beat  Messrs.  Collins  and  Waidner, 
v/inners  of  the  Western  Doubles  at  Chicago,  by  three  sets  to  two, 
and  on  Thursday  beat  the  holders,  Messrs.  Ward  and  Davis  11/9, 
12/10,  6/4,  and  thus  became  the  Champion  Double  players  of 
America  for  1902.  This  is  the  first  time  that  foreigners  have 
held  an  American  Lawn  Tennis  Championship  title.  In  the 
Challenge  round,  out  of  the  52  games  played,  Mr.  R.  F.  Doherty 
and  Mr.  H.  L.  Doherty  lost  one  service  each,  Mr.  Ward  two,  and 
Mr.  Davis  three. 

In  the  Singles  there  were  83  entries.  Dr.  Pim  was  beaten  in 
the  fourth  round  on  the  day  of  his  departure  by  Mr.  Ware.  Mr. 
H.  L.  Doherty  scratched  to  his  brother  in  the  semi-final.  Mr, 
R.  F.  Doherty  beat  Mr.  Whitman  in  the  final  3/1,  but  was 
beaten  by  a  similar  score  by  Mr.  Larned  in  the  Challenge 
round.

From  the  above  it  would  appear  that  the  Americans  have  two 
Single  players  as  good  at  least  as  our  best  player,  but  that  in  the 
Doubles  we  have  a  pair  better  than  anything  that  they  can  for  the 
moment  produce. 

During  our  stay  in  America  we  had  ample  opportunity  of 
seeing  for  ourselves  and  discussing  with  officials  and  players  the 
various  points  of  difference  between  the  game  as  played  in 
America  and  at  home.  These  points  of  difference  are  so  small 
that  I  consider  that  the  time  has  arrived  to  make  the  conditions 
of  play  in  both  countries  as  far  as  possible  the  same,  before  there 
is  a  chance  of  their  drifting  apart.  At  the  risk  of  being  tedious, 
I  beg  to  enumerate  what  seem  to  me  to  be  details  that  require 
adjusting: 

I. â The  nets  in  America  vary  in  color,  in  the  size  of  the 
mesh,  and  in  their  distance  from  the  ground  and  from  the  posts. 
Centre-straps  are  not  uniform,  and  the  net-cord  is  sometimes 
elastic.    The  posts  vary  in  color  and  size. 

Suggestion. â That  the  British  Isles  and  America  decide  upon 
a  uniform  pattern  for  nets,  centre  straps,  net-cords,  posts,  and 
supports. 

2. â The  balls  in  America  are  very  good,  but  appear  to  require 
more  hitting  than  those  in  use  in  England. 

Suggestion. â That  a  standard  of  elasticity  be  agreed  upon  be- 
tween the  two  countries. 

3. â The  courts  which  we  saw  in  America  struck  us  as  being 
above  the  average  of  tournament  courts  in  this  country,  but 
some  of  the  American  machines  do  not  cut  so  closely  as  those 
generally  in  use  at  home. 

Suggestion. â That  a  uniform  type  of  machine  be  used  in  both 
countries  for  the  courts  in  open  tournaments. 

The  American  law  for  changing  sides  at  the  end  of  a  set 
differs  from  ours.  In  our  opinion  the  advantage  claimed  for  the 
American  form  is  only  imaginary. 

Suggestion. â That  America  be  again  asked  to  change  her 
law. 

4. â Notice  has  already  been  given  of  a  motion  having  for  its 
object  the  alteration  of  our  law  with  regard  to  obstacles  in  the 
court,  and  our  law  with  regard  to  serving,  with  a  view  to  making 
our  laws  the  same  as  those  in  the  American  code. 

We  find  that  the  service  law  is  not  so  strictly  obeyed  in 
America  as  at  home,  and  that  players  are  not  always  foot-faulted 
for  a  breach,  especially  if  it  be  on  the  second  service. 

It  has  been  suggested  in  America  that,  with  a  view  to  equaliz- 
ing the  chances  of  the  server  and  the  striker-out  in  the  double 
game,  a  trial  be  given  to  a  wider  margin  between  the  outside 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  37 

service  and  the  outside  lines.     Mr.  Larned  suggests  five  feet  in- 
stead of  four  feet  six  inches. 

It  has  also  been  suggested  that  the  players  in  the  British  Isles 
and  America  be  asked  to  record  their  opinions  with  regard  to 
net-cord  strokes,  and  I  suggest  that  at  the  same  time  their  opinions 
be  taken  as  to  playing  through  challenge  events,  as  a  guide  to 
givers  of  cups  and  to  tournament  committees. 
'  As  an  example  of  the  friendly  feeling  existing  between  devotees 
in  America  and  England,  I  give  an  extract  from  a  letter  received 
by  me,  on  embarking  for  home,  from  a  late  President  of  the 
Crescent  Athletic  Club,  as  follows : 

"I  want  to  congratulate  both  you  and  the  members  of  your 
team  on  their  splendid  work.  They  have  given  a  splendid  ex- 
hibition of  good  old  British  steadiness  and  tenacity,  and  have 
well  earned  their  laurels.  Please  give  Dr,  Pirn  and  the  Messrs. 
Doherty  my  kindest  regards,  with  the  wish  that  we  may  see  you 
all  over  here  another  year." 

With  regard  to  the  Regulations  for  the  International  Cham- 
pionship, I  am  of  opinion  that  arrangements  should  be  made 
for  one  day's  rest  in  the  course  of  the  Competition,  so  that  a 
country  may  be  enabled  to  play  the  same  men  in  both  Singles 
and  Doubles.  '  There  are  other  details  in  the  Regulations  open 
to  improvement,  but  too  minute  for  comment  here. 

In  closing  this  Report  I  wish  to  put  on  record  my  appreciation 
of  the  keenness  of  the  members  of  both  teams  to  do  all  in  their 
power  to  win  honor  for  their  country  in  a  truly  sportsmanlike 
and  friendly  spirit,  and  at  any  sacrifice  to  their  own  conven- 
ience. 

I  have  the  honor  to  remain,  Gentlement,  Yours  very  faithfully,

Captain  of  the  British  Isles  Team,  1902.

The  Match  Committee's  Report. 

To  the  English  L.T.A.: 

We,  the  undersigned,  members  of  the  International  Match 
Committee,  appointed  to  deal  with  the  various  points  arising  in 
Mr.  W.  H.  Collins's  report  as  captain  of  the  British  Isles  Lawn 
Tennis  team  of  1902,  have  met  and  beg  to  report  as  follows : 

I.  We  have  issued  a  separate  report  (reprinted  in  U.S.N.L.T.A. 
Official  Notices)  as  to  various  alterations  in  and  additions 
to  the  regulations  for  the  International  Lawn  Tennis  Champion- 
ship, which  we  suggest  should  be  made. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  39 

II.  We  recommend  that  the  opinions  of  the  members  of  the 
Council  and  of  those  players  who  took  part  in  last  season's  men's 
championship  singles  be  taken  on  the  subject  of  "net-cord  strokes" 
and  also  on  the  question  of  "holders  of  challenge  cups"  playing 
through  the  event.  We  do  not,  however,  recommend  that  the 
above  opinions  be  taken  on  the  question  of  "seeding  the  draw" 
in  the  championship  singles,  as  we  do  not  think  that  a  general 
discussion  of  ihis  subject  would  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the 
game. 

III.  It  is  our  opinion  that  our  law  for  changing  sides  at  the 
end  of  a  set  is  better  than  America's,  and  we  recommend  that 
America  be  again  asked  to  change  her  law  on  this  subject,  so 
as  to  bring  it  into  line  with  ours. 

IV.  We  recommend  that  a  uniform  pattern  for  nets,  centre- 
straps,  net-cords,  posts,  and  supports  be  adopted  for  all  open 
meetings,  inter-country  and  inter-club  matches,  etc.,  but  we  do  not 
venture  upon  a  definition  of  this  pattern,  as  this  is  a  matter  which 
requires  special  technical  knowledge.  We  suggest  that  the  firms 
v/hich  supply  these  articles  to  the  various  tournaments  be  con- 
sulted with  reference  to  the  adoption  of  a  uniform  type  of  machine 
for  cutting  the  courts. 

V.  We  have  considered  the  suggestion  made  by  Mr.  Larned  as 
to  equalizing  the  chances  of  the  server  and  the  striker-out  in 
the  doubles  game  by  giving  a  wider  margin  between  the  outside 
service  and  the  outside  lines.  In  our  opinion,  this  suggestion  will 
not  have  the  desired  effect,  and  do  not  think  that  anything  would 
be  gained  by  giving  it  a  trial. 

At  the  same  time  we  think  that  in  the  doubles  game,  under  the 
present  rules,  the  server  possesses  too  great  an  advantage,  and 
that  the  question  of  equalizing  the  chances  of  the  striker-out  is 
one  which  requires  consideration. 

VI.  As  regards  the  balls,  we  think  that  if  practicable,  a  stan- 
dard of  elasticity  or  resiliency  should  be  agreed  upon  between  the 
two  countries. 

VII.  We  recommend  that  the  regulations  for  the  management 
of  lawn  tennis  prize  meetings  should  contain  a  definition  of  the 
term  "steel  points." 

VIII.  We  also  recommend  that  the  laws  of  the  game  should 
contain  a  definition  as  to  the  breadth  of  the  lines.  We  think 
this  is  specially  important  as  regards  the  centre  service-line.

Dated  the  8th  day  of  December,  1902.  Committee. 


40  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

A  Chat  with  Mr.  W.  H.  Collins. 

It  is  a  matter  of  history  that  Mr.  W.  H.  Collins,  the  President 
of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  acted  as  captain  of  the  British 
team  in  America,  and  that  after  the  international  matches  he 
remained  in  America  with  our  players  until  the  middle  of  the 
American  Championships,  when  he  returned  home  with  Dr.  Pim, 
who  had  been  put  out  in  the  third  round.  Mr.  Collins  has  drawn 
up  a  report,  which  he  has  sent  to  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association, 
and  we  hope  that  as  soon  as  it  has  been  passed  we  shall  be  able 
to  give  it  in  Lawn  Tennis.  In  the  meantime  Mr.  Collins  has 
been  kind  enough  to  answer  a  few  questions  for  the  benefit  of 
readers  of  Lazvn  Tennis,  as  to  the  conditions  of  play  in  the  inter- 
national matches,  etc. 

"The  conditions  of  play  at  Bay  Ridge,"  said  Mr.  Collins,  "were 
perfect,  and  reflect  very  great  credit  upon  the  committee  of  man- 
agement. The  three  match  courts  were  in  excellent  order,  owing 
to  some  extent  to  constant  cutting  with  a  low-set  machine  and 
rolling  with  a  five-ton  steam  roller.  The  balls  had  been  specially 
selected  by  Mr,  George  Wright,  and  gave  every  satisfaction.  Our 
men  had  had  ample  time  and  opportunity  to  get  used  to  any 
small  differences  there  may  be  between  playing  in  this  country 
and  across  the  Atlantic.  I  wish  it  to  be  clearly  understood  thai 
our  men  lost  the  international  match  because  the  other  men 
were  playing  better  than  we  were  in  the  Singles.  In  fact,  as  far 
as  I  can  see,  there  are  two  Americans  as  good  at  least  as  our 
best  player  in  Singles,  and  I  think  the  Americans  will  acknowl- 
edge that  we  have  a  stronger  Double  than  they  can  produce.  We 
were  fortunate  during  my  stay  in  not  having  any  very  hot  weather 
while  a  really  important  match  was  on.  But  on  other  occasions 
we  realized  what  a  hot  day  there  really  is â the  atmosphere 
is  so  laden  with  moisture  that  one  almost  has  to  gasp  for  breath, 
and  even  when  one  is  sitting  down  quietly  the  perspiration  sim- 
ply runs  down  one's  face.  The  Americans  don't  seem  to  mind 
it." 

"Can  you  suggest  any  improvement  in  the  conditions  for  the 
international  matches?" 

"It  would  be  interesting  some  day  to  have  a  match  with 
America  with  six  players  a  side  on  the  lines  of  the  England  v. 
Ireland  match â six  Singles  and  nine  Doubles.  Your  readers 
might  amuse  themselves  by  selecting  what  they  think  are  the 
best  teams  and  prophesy  the  result.  If  we  find  out  early  enough 
next  year  that  we  cannot  challenge  for  the  Davis  Cup  it  might 
be  worth  while  asking  America  to  challenge  us  on  these  lines. 
It  would  make  the  finest  lawn  tennis  contest  there  has  ever  been 
in  anv  cotmtrv." 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  41 

"Will  you  say  something  about  the  choice  of  the  Singles 
teams?" 

"People  are  constantly  asking  me  why  'The  Doctor'  was  chosen 
instead  of  H.  L.  Doherty.  They  don't  seem  to  realize  that  the 
Americans  had  fresh  men  for  the  Doubles,  and  that  sometimes 
in  America  it  is  hot.  If  H.  L.  Doherty  had  played  on  Wednesday 
and  Thursday  in  the  Singles,  and  the  weather  had  not  been  as 
it  was,  propitious,  he  might  have  been  a  'rag'  on  the  Friday. 
Apart  from  that,  'The  D^octor'  was  playing  extremely  well  in 
practice  against  the  Dohertys,  and  we  saw  no  reason  before  the 
match  that  he  would  not  show  the  Americans  some  of  his  old 
quality.  He  was  never  in  better  training  in  his  hfe,  I  should  say. 
I.  don't  even  think  that  he  was  overtrained,  although  he  had 
taken  off  more  than  two  stone  in  six  weeks.  People  over  here 
do  not  seem  to  realize  that  Larned  and  Whitman  are  very  good. 
Larned  is  not  always  at  the  top  of  his  game,  thank  goodness! 
but  whoever  is?  The  impression  left  on  our  minds  was  that 
Larned  is  a  better  player  than  Whitman.  Over  there  they  seem 
to  have  a  wholesome  fear  of  Whitmanâ with  some  it  seems  to 
amount  to  a  positive  funk.  It  almost  made  us  glad  to  find  Larned 
in  a  good  'streak,'  since  those  not  in  a  position  to  know  were 
rather  severe  on  the  selection  committee  for  having  chosen  hmi 
instead  of  Beals  Wright." 

"Do  you  think  that  if  H.  L.  Doherty  had  met  Mr.  Whitman  or 
Mr.  Larned  he  might  have  won?" 

"It  is  impossible  to  say.  But  I  was  amused  at  lunch  on  the 
first  day  of  the  match  by  H.  L.  jokingly  remarking:  This  must 
be  a  jolly  fine  team  of  yours,  "Father"  (that's  what  they  felt 
young  enough  to  call  me),  since  I  see  that  you  have  not  found 
it  necessary  to  ask  either  the  English  or  Irish  champion  to  play.' 
Supposing  that  our  present  champion  had  played,  does  it  follow 
that  he  would  have  beaten  either  Mr.  Whitman  or  Mr.  Larned? 
It  certainly  does  follow  that  he  would  have  strained  every  nerve 
in  the  effort,  and  where  might  he  have  been  in  the  Doubles  ?  But 
this  is  all  after  the  event.  Anyone  can  make  a  show  of  wisdom 
then.  Anyone  of  our  critics  would  have  come  to  the  same  de- 
cision as  we  did  on  the  afternoon  of  Tuesday,  August  5."_ 

"Can  you  say  anything  as  to  the  effect  of  the  twist  service  on 
the  results?  This  is  what  English  players  are  anxious  to 
learn."  ^^     ., 

"You  should  ask  the  players.  I'm  not  an  expert.  My  idea 
was  that  Whitman's  service  did  not  help  him  much.  It  got  up 
to  a  good  height,  and  was  always  one  way.  with  very  little  pace 
in  it,  and  the  ball  was  easily  returned.  Davis  had  such  a  fine 
straight  service  that  it  seems  hardly  worth  his  while  usmg  the 


42  SPALDING  S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

twist,  except  against  people  who  don't  know  and  are  not  pre- 
pared for  its  cussedness.  With  Ward  it  may  be  different.  His 
twist  service  struck  me  as  the  most  effective  of  the  lot.  Speak- 
ing generally,  I  saw  no  service  in  America  to  compare  with  R.  F. 
Doherty's.     Americans,  please  copy." 

"The  Americans  seem  to  have  shown  the  best  of  good  feeling 
in  connection  with  these  matches  and  the  reception  of  the 
team?" 

"Nothing  could  exceed  the  kindness  and  thoughtfulness  by 
which  we  were  met  on  all  sides.  As  an  example,  Mr.  Brown, 
of  the  Longwood  C.C,  not  content  with  meeting  us  in  New 
York  and  seeing  us  through  to  Boston,  insisted  upon  returning  to 
New  York  with  us,  so  that  we  might  not  have  any  trouble  with 
our  luggage.  Colonel  Thompson,  knowing  that  the  journey 
from  Southampton  to  Newport  was  cross  country  and  unpleasant, 
placed  his  steam  yacht  at  our  disposal.  In  fact,  from  start  to 
finish  everything  was  done  to  make  us  feel  that  we  were  wel- 
come. On  more  than  one  occasion  we  were  staying  under  the 
same  roof  as  our  opponents.  The  feeling  all  round  was,  'May 
everyone  be  at  the  top  of  his  game,  and,  may  the  better  side 
win.'  I  heard  yesterday  from  the  chairman  of  the  Committee  of 
Management  at  Bay  Ridge.  In  the  course  of  his  letter  he  re- 
marksâ T  can  say  for  myself,  as  well  as  for  us  all,  that  you  all 
left  with  us  pleasant  memories  of  your  stay  at  our  Club." 

"Have  the  appointments  of  the  game  in  America  been  im- 
proved since  the  visit  of  the  team  of  1900?" 

"Speaking  generally,  our  appointments  are  better  than  those  in 
America â by  appointments  I  mean  nets,  posts,  net-cords,  centre 
straps,  and  stop-netting  and  the  like â but  at  Bay  Ridge  there  was 
really  nothing  with  which  one  could  find  fault  in  the  slightest 
degree.  With  regard  to  rackets,  one  of  two  famous  brothers 
told  me  that  if  they  could  get  rackets  as  good  as  those  used  by 
our  team,  they  would  take  to  the  game  again  seriously â and  a 
good  thing  for  the  game  too,  in  my  opinion.  Some  think  they  are 
a  better  pair  than  Ward  and  Davis." 

"How  do  Americans  stand  in  the  matter  of  umpires  and  ball 
boys?" 

"Apparently  there  are  very  few  umpires  in  America.  I  can 
only  call  to  mind  four  in  four  weeks :  the  ever-present  Mr.  Mans- 
field, of  the  Boston  Globe â long  may  his  voice  last  him ! â Mr. 
Terry,  of  Southampton,  with  his  cheery  words  of  encouragement 
to  the  players ;  and  'BoB'  Wrenn  and  'Ollie'  Campbell,  of  pious 
memory.  You  should  see  'Ollie'  serve !  Perhaps  the  foot-fault 
rule  was  different  in  his  day.  I  never  saw  a  man  so  careful 
before   serving,   and   so   careless   while   it   was   going  on.     With 


44  SPALDING  S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

regard  to  the  service  generally,  I  think  they  are  less  careful  about 
foot-faulting  than  we  are.  In  the  International  Doubles  I  was 
asked  to  keep  an  eye  on  the  base-line.  Neither  Palmer  Presbrey, 
Richard  Stevens  nor  I  could  see  any  infringement.  Mr.  Lamed 
and  Mr.  Carlton  were  on  the  base-lines.  Larned  takes  up  such 
a  position  before  serving  that  I  think  it  would  not.  be  possible 
for  him  to  foot-fault.  He  places  his  left  foot  parallel  with  the 
base-line.  The  American  service  law  seems  better  than  ours, 
but  we  think  that  their  law  of  changing  or  not  changing  sides 
at  the  end  of  a  set  should  be  altered.  Their  ball  boys  are  quite 
impossible,  except  at  Bay  Ridge,  where  the  relations  of  members 
officiated â notably  I  remember  the  nephew  of  the  President, 
Mr.  Ford,  better  known  as  'Father  Bill.' '" 
"Do  Americans  seem  very  keen  about  the  game?" 
"The  people  and  the  press  in  America  are  much  keener  than  in 
this  country.  The  game,  in  fact,  has  a  much  stronger  hold.  All 
the  important  dailies  reported  matches  in  full,  with  illustrations. 
I  must  send  you  some,  not  necessarily  for  publication.  But 
America  generally  is  too  big  and  too  rapid.  England  is  good 
enough  for  me,  in  spite  of  the  danger  of  'slipping  off  the 
edge.' " 

In  conclusion,  Mr.  Collins  made  a  suggestion  with  regard  to 
the  Doubles  game.  "The  Dohertys,"  he  said,  "met  Davis  and 
Ward  twice  and  beat  them,  3/6,  10/8,  6/3,  6/4,  11 /p,  12/10,  6/4â 
98  games  in  all.  The  service  lost  only  fifteen  times â R.  F.  twise, 
H.  L.  three  times,  and  Ward  and  Davis  five  times  each.  Surely 
this  points  to  the  necessity  of  some  change  in  the  laws  of  the 
Double  game. 


From  the  British  Team  Captain. 

The  following  open  letter  to  the  American  lawn  tennis  players 
was  printed  in  the  official  organ  last  fall : 
Editor  of  American  Lawn  Tennis: 

Dear  Sir :  Through  the  medium  of  your  valuable  paper,  and 
on  behalf  of  the  British  lawn  tennis  team,  I  beg  to  convey  the 
deep  sense  of  our  appreciation,  ( i )  of  the  great  pains^  successfully 
taken  by  the  officials  to  make  the  conditions  of  play  in  the  Inter- 
national match  perfect,  (2)  of  the  sportsmanlike  manner  in  which 
we  were  dealt  with  by  the  players,  (3)  of  the  fairness  of  the  press 
and  the  spectators,  (4)  and  of  the  universal  kindness,  "courtesy, 
cordiality  and  hospitality  which  we  received  during  our  stay  in 
vour  country. 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  45 

You  have  proved  yourselves  stronger  than  we  are,  and  the 
lessons  we  have  learned  should  stand  us  in  good  stead;  if  on  the 
other  hand,  we  have  done  good  to  the  game  in  America  we  have 
achieved  one  of  our  objects  in  crossing  the  Atlantic.  You  may 
rest  assured  that  there  is  a  hearty  welcome  awaiting  your  players 
when  they  arrive  in  what  we  are  happy  to  regard  in  common  as 
"the  old  country."     Yours  very  truly, 

W.  H.  Collins, 

Captain  of  the  British  Team  of  1902, 
and  President  of  the  L.T.A. 
Croydon,  England.  September  3.  1902.

PREVIOUS  INTERNATIONAL  CHAMPIONSHIP 
RECORDS 

The  Davis  International  Championship  Trophy,  which  repre- 
sents the  world's  championship  at  lawn  tennis,  was  offered  in 
1900  by  Dwight  F.  Davis,  of  St.  Louis,  Mo.,  to  be  held  as  a  per- 
petual challenge  cup.  The  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association 
challenged  for  its  possession  the  first  season  it  was  put  up,  and 
sent  a  team  composed  of  A.  W.  Gore,  E.  D.  Black  and  H.  R. 
Barrett,  to  America  in  the  confident  hope  of  winning  the  new 
trophy.  Their  effort  was  a  failure,  for  the  Americans  beat  them 
in  every  match  played,  as  shown  by  the  following  record : 

SINGLES. 

M.    D.    Whitman    (America)    beat   A.    W.    Gore    (Great    Britain),    6/1, 

6/3,   6/2. 
D.   F.   Davis    (America)    beat  E.   D.   Black    (Great  Britain),   4/6,   6/2, 

6/4,  6/4. 
D.    F.    Davis    (America)    vs.    A.    W.    Gore    (Great    Britain),    9/7,    9/9 

(unfinished â interrupted  by  rain), 
M.    D.    Whitman    (America)    vs.    E.    D.    Black    (Great    Britain),    not 

played. 

DOUBLES. 

D.    F.    Davis   and   Holcombe    Ward    (Am.erica)    beat   E.    D.    Black   and 
H.  R.  Barrett   (Great  Britain),  6/4,  6/4,  6/4. 

RESULT. 

America  won  by  8  matches  to  0,  10  sets  to  1,  and  76  games  to  50. 

The  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association  challenged  again  in 
igoi  for  the  Davis  Cup  and  all  preparations  were  made  to  meet 
the  visitors,  but  at  the  last  minute  they  cabled  over  a  withdrawal 
of  the  challenge,  as  they  were  unable  to  secure  a  representative 
team  to  come  to  America  to  play. 

The  third  attempt  to  "lift  the  cup"  was  also  frustrated  by  the 
American  players  last  season,  a  full  report  of  the  matches  appear- 
ing in  the  preceding  chapter.  Still  another  effort  will  be  made 
this  year,  for  the  English  Association  has  again  challenged  for 
the  trophy  and  their  challenge  has  been  accepted.  The  week  of 
August  3  has  been  set  aside  for  the  Internationals  this  season, 
Boston, 
and   the  matches   will   be   held  at   the  Longwood   Cricket   Club. 

Before  ever  jhe  Davis  Cup  was  placed  in  competition,  there 
were  a  number  of  unofficial  matches  played.     Way  back  in  the 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  47 

eighties,  Dr.  James  Dwight  and  R.  D.  Sears,  of  Boston,  then 
the  leading  American  players,  spent  several  seasons  abroad  and 
met  the  leading  English  players  there,  as  also  did  the  Clark 
brothers,  of  Philadelphia,  but  they  were  all  outclassed  on  the 
other  side.  In  1892,  O.  S.  Campbell,  then  champion  of  America, 
played  in  a  number  of  the  English  tournaments  with  varymg 
successes,  but  his  defeats  far  outnumbered  his  victories,  and 
he  was  rated  at  the  end  of  the  season  well  down  from  the  best 
of  the  foreign  players,  although  still  holding  the  American  cham- 
pionship. ,  .        ,         1 

In  1896,  W.  A.  Earned,  now  the  American  champion,  but  then 
rated  just  below  the  champion  of  the  year,  made  an  English 
campaign  and  won  more  success  than  any  of  his  predecessors 
had  done  before  him.  At  Wimbledon,  however,  he  was  beaten 
for  the  English  championship  by  Herbert  Baddeley,  one  of  the 
best  of  the  English  players,  and  was  rated  several  notches  below 
the  best  of  the  English  players  at  the  end  of  the  year.  Clarence 
Hobart  plaved  abroad  in  1898  and  1899,  but  did  not  manage  to 
earn  a  place  among  the  leaders  abroad,  although  he  made  a 
fvorable  showing  in  the  championship  doubles  each  year  with 
H.  A.  Nisbet  for  a  partner.  ,  ,    tt  1        u 

Then  came  the  famous  trip  of  D.  F.  Davis  and  Holcombe 
Ward  to  English  courts  in  1901.  Davis  and  Ward  thexi  held 
the  American  championship  in  doubles,  and  they  confined  their 
play  on  the  other  side  to  the  doubles  games.  In  this  they  won 
every  match  played  but  two,  their  only  defeats  being  at  the  Jiands 
of  the  Doherty  brothers,  the  English  champions,  in  an  exhibition 
match  two  weeks  before  the  championship,  and  m  the  challenge 
round  for  the  English  championship  at  Wimbledon,  in  this 
memorable  encounter,  the  men  waged  a  drawn  battle  the  hrst 
day,  the  play  being  interrupted  by  ram,  and  on  the  play-ott  the 
next  day,  the  Americans  were  beaten  only  after  a  close  and 
exciting  match  by  three  close  sets  to  one.  ^         .         ^ 

A  number 'of  foreign  players  entered  American  tournaments 
before  the  Davis  Cup  was  established.  In  1889,  E.  G.  Meers 
came  to  America  and  played  at  Newport,  beating  several  of  our 
strong  players,  only  to  finally  succumb  in  the  semi-final  round 
after  five  close  sets  with  O.  S.  Campbell.  In  1893,  Dr.  J.  Pim 
and  H  S.  Mahony,  two  famous  Irish  experts  and  both  English 
championship  holders,  took  part  in  an  invitation  tournament 
at  West  Newton,  Mass.,  against  four  of  the  strongest  American 
players,  R.  D.  Wrenn,  the  championship  holder,  being  the  only 
prominent  absentee  from  the  entry-list^  Pim  and  Mahony  won 
every  match  but  one,  that  in  which  Clarence  Hobart  beat  Dr 
Pim     In  the  play-off  of  the  tie  that  resulted,  Pim  beat  Mahony 


SPALDING  S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL.  49 

a  second  time,  and  the  two  visitors  took  first  and  second  honors 
between  them.  An  exhibition  match  in  doubles  was  arranged, 
however,  with  Pim  and  Mahony  against  Hobart  and  Hovey,  the 
American  champions,  and  the  visitors  were  rather  badly  beaten 
by  the  Americans. 

M.  F.  Goodbody  came  to  America  th'e  following  season,  180/1. 
and  made  a  remarkable  showing  at  Newport.  Goodbody  beat 
Hobart,  Hovey  and  Larned,  the  flower  of  our  home  players, 
on  successive  days,  and  each  in  a  five-set  match,  only  to  finally 
fall  a  victim  to  the  clever  strategy  of  R.  D.  Wrenn  in  the  chal- 
lenge round  for  the  American  championship. 

In  1897,  a  team  of  three  players.  Dr.  W.  V.  Eaves,  H.  S.  Ma- 
hony and  H.  A.  Nisbit,  came  unofficially  to  America  to  meet 
the  home  players  in  a  series  of  international  matches.  This 
series  was  played  at  the  St.  George  Cricket  Club,  in  Hoboken, 
and  the  Englishmen  were  beaten  by  five  matches  to  four  after  a 
rather  close  ending.  W.  A.  Larned,  R'.  D.  Wrenn  and  G.  L. 
Wrenn,  Jr.,  were  the  Americans  who  met  the  visitors  in  this 
international    series. 

These  were  the  last  International  matches  before  the  Davis 
Cup  was  established,  and  since  then  the  matches  have  all  been 
officially  sanctioned  and  recognized  as  for  the  World's  Cham- 
pionship. In  1900.  the  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association  offi- 
cially recognized  the  Davis  Cup  as  emblematic  of  the  World's 
Championship  and  a  code  of  "International  Regulations"  was 
drawn  up  and  signed  by  the  officials  of  the  two  representative 
associations.     This  code  follows  in  the  next  chapter. 


50  SrAT.DTNG's    I.AWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.

the  visiting  Nations. 

3. â For  the  year  1900  the  Challenge  Tie  shall  be  played  in  the

by  the  Committee  of  Management. 

Should  no  Challenge  be  received  by  the  first  Monday  of  March 
in  the  year  in  which  the  Competition  is  to  take  place,  or  if  such 
challenge  as  may  be  received  by  that  time  be  withdrawn,  the  first

shall  decide,  if  he  be  called  upon  to  decide  by  the  Captain  of 
either  side,  whether  or  not  a  Match  or  Matches  shall  be  stopped 
owing  to  the  state  of  the  courts,  the  state  of  the  weather,  dark-

to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Referee,  another  member  of  the  team 
can  be  substituted,  provided  the  Captain  of  the  other  team  gives 
his  consent. 

12.â The  above  Regulations  shall  be  binding  upon  the  Nations

54  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

two-thirds  of  the  Associations  whose  Nations  shall  have  from 
time  to  time  competed  and  who  shall  record  their  votes. 
Note. â In  the  above  Regulations,  one  Nation  playing  against 
another  is  regarded  as  a  "Tie;"  Singles  and  Doubles  are  re- 
garded as  separate  "Contests ;"  and  the  best  of  five  advantage 
sets  is  regarded  as  a  "Match."  The  players  in  Singles  and 
Doubles  are  regarded  as  separate  "Teams,"  and  the  players 
in  the  combined  Contests  as  a  "Side." 


Changes  Suggested  by  English  L.  T.  A. 

{New  wording  shown  by  italics.) 

The  following  changes  in  the  foregoing  International  Regula- 
tions have  been  suggested  by  the  English  Lawn  Tennis  Asso- 
ciation, but  no  final  action  on  them  had  been  taken  by  the 
U.S.N.L.T.A.  when  this  book  went  to  press: 

4A.  The  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  each  of  the  nations  con- 
cerned shall  appoint  a  captain  of  its  side;  in  default  of  such  ap- 
pointment its  side  shall  appoint  a  captain. 

5.  A  referee  shall  be  appointed  by  common  consent  of  the 
captains  of  the  competing  sides. 

10.  Subject  to  Regulation  6,  in  Singles  and  Doubles,  notice  of 
the  teams  chosen  shall  be  given  by  such  captain  to  the  captain 
of  the  opposing  side  not  less  than  twenty-one  hours  before  the 
time  fixed  for  the  commencement  of  play  in  each  contest. 
The  order  of  play  as  regards  Singles  and  Doubles  respect- 
ively, shall  be  decided  hy  the  captains  of  the  competing 
sides,  or  hy  the  referee  if  they  shall  fail  to  come  to  an  agree- 
ment, and  shall  be  announced  not  less  than  twenty-four 
hours  before  the  first  notice  from  the  captains  is  due.  In  case  of 
postponement  of  play,  an  alteration  in  the  composition  of  a  team 
can  be  made,  provided  ahvays  that  a  player  who  is  withdrawn 
from  a  team  shall  not  have  started  play  in  his  contest,  and  that 
due  notice  he  given,  that  is  to  say,  not  less  than  twenty-one  hours 
before  the  time  iixed  for  the  commencement  of  play  in  the  post- 
poned contest.

NATIONAL  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENTS 


The  Men's  Championship  at  Newport. 

The  twenty-second  annual  open  tournament  for  the  amateur 
championship  of  the  United  States  was  held  during  the  week  of 
August  19  and  the  first  part  of  the  following  week,  on  the 
grounds  of  the  Casino,  at  Newport,  R.  I.  The  entry-list  broke 
all  records  for  Newport  meetings  with  a  list  of  83  players,  among 
them  being  every  one  of  the  leading  American  experts,  and  the 
two  Doherty  brothers  and  Dr.  J.  Pim,  of  the  British  Inter- 
national team.  The  tournament  assumed  almost  as  much  an 
air  of  international  importance  as  the  matches  for  the  Davis 
Cup  itself.  While  the  American  defenders  of  the  International 
Championship  had  succeeded  in  defeating  the  challenging  visitors 
in  the  official  matches,  it  would  have  been  no  less  disastrous 
if  the  foreigners  should  have  succeeded  in  carrying  off  the  Amer- 
ican championships,  and  the  same  interest  was  kept  up  until 
the  last  match  in. which  the  Dohertys  played  was  finished. 

The  draw  was  an  uneven  one,  bringing  all  three  of  the  visitors 
in  the  same  section  of  the  tournament,  and  as  good  luck  would 
have  it,  the  strongest  of '  the  American  players.  Whitman  and 
Wright,  in  the  other  half.  Dr.  Pim  and  Captain  W.  H.  Collins, 
of  the  British  team,  announced  that  they  would  sail  at  the  end 
of  the  week  for  home,  yet  Pim  insisted  on  playing  in  the  tour- 
nament up  to  the  last  day,  and  he  went  on  putting  his  opponents 
out  until  he  met  Leo  Ware  in  the  fourth  round.  Pim  was  sup- 
posed to  outclass  Ware,  being  rated  as  one  of  the  very  best 
players  in  Great  Britain,  but  thefast,  aggressive  net  play  of  the 
American  was  too  much  for  him,  and  he  succumbed  in  straight 
sets  to  his  younger  rival.  The  victory  of  Ware  was  a  surprise 
to  even  the  American  enthusiasts,  who  did  not  believe  any  of 
their  players  except  the  two  or  three  leaders  were  good  enough 
to  beat  Pim.  The  Irishman  was  over-confident  and  evidently 
scorned  lobbing.  He  stuck  to  his  low  passing  strokes  and  with 
his  usual  under-cut  that  made  the  balls  doubly  easy  to  volley, 
so  that  Ware  killed  them  constantly  at  the  net,  with  disastrous 
results. 

Ware  was  unable  to  get  a  set  from  H.  L.  Doherty  in  the  next 
round,  however,  and  went  out  quickly,  although  he  made  a 
strong   defence   in   the  first   set   which   ran   up   to   9/7.     In   the

meantime,  R.  F.  Doherty  had  been  running  rapidly  through  his 
field  until  he  came  against  his  brother  in  the  semi-finals.  After 
some  hesitation,  which  lasted  until  an  hour  before  the  time  set 
for  the  final  match,  the  younger  Doherty  defaulted  to  his  brother, 
who  played  Whitman  in  the  finals.  On  the  other  side,  in  the 
meanwhile.  Whitman  had  disposed  of  Wright  in  a  clever  four- 
set  match,  and  Collins,  the  Western  champion,  with  much  less 
difficulty.  Huntington  had  caused  considerable  surprise  by  beat- 
ing Little  m  straight  sets,  and  had  worried  Whitman  badly  for 
four  sets  in  the  semi-finals. 

The  final  match  between  R,  F.  Doherty  and  Whitman  was  a 
big  disappointment  to  the  American  contingent.  Whitman  had 
already  beaten  Doherty  in  three  straight  sets  in  the  Interna- 
tional matches  and  he  was  thought  to  be  able  to  do  it  again, 
although  the  wiser  ones  who  had  watched  his  poor  play  agains*^ 
Huntington  thought  he  might  reverse  his  previous  form  in  the 
finals.  The  play  itself  was  very  different  from  what  had  been 
expected  of  the  men.  Doherty  was  fast  in  all  his  strokes,  killing 
was  more  certain  than  he  had  shown  before  and  his  lobbing  more 
safe.  But  most  of  all,  his  passing  strokes  were  better  directed 
and  came  off  his  racquet  with  much  more  crispness  and  passed 
much  closer  to  the  net  than  in  any  of  his  previous  matches.  He 
had  little  to  contend  against,  to  be  sure,  and  this  always  in- 
creases the  strength  of  a  player's  game  and  shows  it  to  better 
advantage,  but  he  was  very  deadly  on  lobs  and  even  the  reverse 
twist  service  did  not  stop  him  from  bringing  off  the  most  perfect 
passing  strokes. 

Whitman  was  the  merest  shadow  of  himself  and  only  for  a  few 
games  during  the  second  and  third  sets  did  he  show  anything 
like  the  form  he  had  at  Bay  Ridge.  He  showed  absolutely  no 
speed  at  any  time  in  the  match,  not  so  much  as  our  second-class 
players,  and  his  passing  strokes  were  so  high  and  so  near  the 
center  of  the  net  that  it  was  the  easiest  kind  of  work  for  Doherty 
to  go  to  them  and  kill.  He  let  off  a  number  of  the  shortest  and 
easiest  kinds  of  lobs,  "sitters"  as  the  Englishmen  call  them,  by 
knocking  them  into  the  net  or  tapping  them  down  so  lightly 
that  Doherty  had  little  difficulty  in  reaching  the  ball  again  and 
saving  the  stroke.

The  challenge  match  between  Larned  and  Doherty  brought  out 
even  more  enthusiasm  than  the  final  the  day  before.  The  Ameri- 
can champion  had  lost  to  Doherty  in  the  International  matches 
and  most  of  the  observers  were  led  astray  by  the  easy  victory  of 
the  visitor  over  Whitman  so  that  they  could  not  figure  out  mucli 
chance  for  Larned  in  the  championship  round.  The  day  was  a 
very  hot  one,  however,  and  the  heat  and  Doherty's  fatigue  from 
his  hard  final  of  the  day  before  told  heavily  against  him. 

Larned  victory  was  one  of  condition  and  perseverance  rather 
than  distinctly  superior  skill.  The  first  two  sets  were  played 
out  on  a  scientific  basis  and  neither  man  lobbed  to  any  extent. 
It  was  fast,  brilliant  tennis  and  each  won  while  his  stroke  was 
on,  or  rather  Larned  won  while  his  brilliant  streak  lasted,  and 
lost  when  he  was  less  steady,  the  Englishman  always  being 
steady  as  a  church.  After  the  middle  of  the  third  set,  however, 
it  was  purely  a  question  of  endurance,  and  the  foreigner  was 
handicapped  by  lack  of  practice  under  such  trying  conditions.  It 
was  the  first  really  hot  day  the  British  team  had  to  contend  with. 
When  the  men  were  in  distress  it  was  safe  to  lob  but  before  that 
every  lob  was  killed  and  the  only  profitable  play  was  fast  passing 
strokes  and  quick  volleys. 

Doherty  easily  held  the  advantage  until  the  end  of  the  first 
set,  and  it  was  not  until  the  second  that  Larned  settled  down 
to  the  full  speed  of  his  brilliant  game.  He  clearly  outplayed 
the  challenger  in  this  second  set  and  won  easily,  his  passing 
strokes  being  exceptionally  clever.  The  third  was  the  turning- 
point  of  the  match  and  both  men  were  pretty  well  exhausted  by 
the  middle  of  this  set,  as  the  heat  had  grown  intense  and  there 
was  little  air  stirring.  Doherty  seemed  to  be  more  affected  by 
the  heat  than  the  American  champion,  and  his  strokes  slowed  up 
much  toward  the  end  of  the  third  set.  The  rest  refreshed 
the  visitor  noticeably,  but  before  the  middle  of  the  fourth  set 
he  was  again  in  difficulties,  and  Larned  then  held  a  clear  advan- 
tage of  strength  as  well  as  strokes.

In  the  doubles,  there  were  two  brniiant  matches  that  occupied 
the  chief  attention  during  the  first  two  days.  Collins  and  Waid- 
ner,  who  had  won  the  Western  championship,  met  the  Doherty 
brothers,  who  had  won  the  Eastern  championship,  but  who  had 
also  in  the  meantime  beaten  the  American  champions  in  the 
International  matches.  The  Westerners  were  thought  to  be 
outclassed,  but  to  the  surprise  of  everyone,  they  put  up  a  splendid 
fight,  and  if  Waidner  had  played  nearly  as  well  as  Collins  in 
the  last  two  sets,  they  might  still  have  had  a  strong  chance  for 
the  championship.  They  earned  a  lead  of  two  sets  to  one,  but 
after  that  the  Doherty  brothers  settled  down  in  their  imperturba- 
ble manner  and  pulled  out  the  match  with  the  last  two  sets  at 
6/3  each. 

The  challenge  match  was  played  two  days  later,  with  the  Do- 
herty brothers,  as  challengers,  once  more  pitted  against  Davis 
and  Ward.  Ward  in  the  meantime  had  been  thrown  entirely  out 
of  practice  by  a  death  in  his  family  that  upset  all  of  his  training, 
and  he  was  in  poor  shape  for  the  challenge  match.  Davis,  how- 
ever, was  in  good  form  and  when  Ward  went  to  pieces  at  the 
end  of  the  match,  Davis  was  the  mainstay  of  the  team  and  staved 
off  defeat  well.  The  Englishmen  were  perfect  marvels  of  ma- 
chine-like accuracy  and  steadiness  in  their  play.  While  never  so 
aggressive  nor  so  fast  in  their  play,  they  were  always  more 
certain  of  their  strokes  than  Davis  and  Ward  and  they  saved 
their  strength  to  much  better  purpose.  The  contrasts  were  very 
marked,  the  Britishers  never  seeming  to  work  so  hard  or  to 
make  such  brilliant  strokes,  yet  still  winning  more  points  with 
less  effort. 

From  start  to  finish  the  match  provided  the  finest  exhibition 
of  scientific  tennis  that  has  been  seen  at  Newport  for  many  years. 
The  spectacular  play  kept  the  big  crowd  in  a  fever  of  excitement 
for  two  hours  and  a  half  and  the  hot  sun  and  humidity  kept 
the  players  in  a  dripping  perspiration.  The  match  was  played 
without  rest  and  the  players  were  all  in  distress  at  one  time  or 
another  during  the  struggle. 

The  American  twist  service  played  an  important  part  in  the 


Thb  C^AtAP/ONSHfP  CHALLÂ£f^Qe:  Cup 


^^^r^^^^

match,  and  but  for  that  the  home  team  could  not  have  stood  off 
defeat  for  so  long.  The  Dohertys  both  found  it  difficult  to  drive 
the  balls  or  to  lob  with  accuracy  from  these  erratic  bounds,  and 
the  American  pair  were  able  to  hold  a  large  proportion  of  their 
service  games.  But  the  weakness  of  both  Davis  and  Ward  in 
driving  the  services  of  the  Britishers  overcame  their  advantage, 
for  they  seemed  unable  to  stop  the  Dohertys  from  winning  on 
their  own  service  games. 

During  the  entire  match  of  fifty-two  games,  only  seven  times 
was  the  team  with  the  service  beaten,  and  the  match  resembled 
in  some  respects  the  six-day  bicycle  race  when  the  riders  struggle 
to  win  a  lap  as  these  players  tried  for  a  game  against  their  oppo- 
nents' service.  Once  won  it  seemed  sure  to  give  them  the  set. 
Davis  lost  one  service  game  in  the  first  set  and  this  turned  the 
set  in  favor  of  the  Englishmen.  In  the  second  set  the  Americans 
captured  one  game,  the  fifth,  against  H.  L.  Doherty's  easy  ser- 
vice, but  Davis  lost  twice  on  his,  and  that  returned  the  advantage 
they  had  won  and  finally  gave  the  set  to  the  visitors.  Ward  lost 
a  game  in  the  last  set,  but  the  champions  recaptured  it  against 
R.  F.  Doherty's  service,  only  to  lose  it  again  by  Ward's  weakness, 
and  the  set  and  match  with  it.  The  summary  showed  that  Davis 
lost  three  service  games,  Ward  two  and  each  of  the  Englishmen 
one. 

During  the  early  part  of  the  match  Ward  was  the  star  player 
of  the  four,  and  his  killing  power  was  brilliant  in  the  first  and 
second  sets.  He  volleyed  with  marvelous  accuracy,  and  his  sharp 
cross-court  killing  strokes  brought  the  big  crowd  to  its  feet 
repeatedly  in  cheering  enthusiasm.  Ward  was  better  than  Davis 
imtil  the  last  set.  He  saved  his  big  partner  a  good  deal  of  the 
hard  work,  doing  most  of  the  running  and  overhead  volleying, 
and  this  tired  him. 

A  summary  of  the  match  at  the  end  showed  that,  although 
they  lost,  Davis  and  Ward  earned  78  points  against  39  for  the 
Dohertys,  but  made  almost  twice  as  many  errors.  The  percentage 
of  the  Americans  was  exceptionally  high,  for  they  scored  more 
than  half  of  their  points  by  earned  aces,  although  they  were 
beaten.  In  individual  play  Ward  earned  21  aces  in  the  first  set 
alone,  against  20  for  the  younger  and  19  for  the  older  Doherty 
in  the  whole  three  sets.

Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  67 

The  Women's  Championships. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  women's  championship  of  the 
United  States  was  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A. 
on  the  grounds  of  the  Philadelphia  Cricket  Club,  Wissahickon 
Heights,  Philadelphia,  during  the  week  of  June  24.  The  entry 
was  even  better  than  usual,  and  the  list  included  no  fewer  than 
five  or  six  strong  candidates  for  the  championship  title,  among 
them  being  ex-champions.  Miss  Marion  Jones  and  Miss  Marion 
Jones.  Miss  Winona  Closterman,  of  Cincinnati,  was  one  of  the 
stars  of  whom  a  good  deal  was  expected,  but  she  failed  to  come 
up  to  the  skill  predicted  for  her,  and  was  beaten  rather  easily 
in  the  second  round  by  Miss  Carrie  Neely,  of  Chicago.  Miss 
Marie  Wimer,  of  Washington,  also  disappointed  her  many  friends 
and  fell  an  easy  victim  to  Miss  Atkinson  also  in  the  second 
round,  leaving  Miss  Jones,  Miss  Atkinson,  Miss  Neely  and  Miss 
Helen  Chapman,  the  Pennsylvania  state  champion,  for  the  semi- 
finals. 

Miss  Chapman  was  easily  disposed  of  by  Miss  Jones,  but  the 
other  semi-final  between  Miss  Atkinson  and  Miss  Neely  fur- 
nished a  long-drawn  match  that  was  finally  ended  in  favor  of  the 
Western  woman  after  an  exciting  struggle.  Miss  Jones  beat  Miss 
Neely  in  the  finals  without  requiring  a  third  set,  and  then  met 
Miss  Moore  in  the  challenge  match  for  the  championship.  Miss 
Moore  was  in  poor  health  and  really  should  not  have  played  the 
match,  but  persisted  in  trying  to  do  the  impossible  in  defending 
her  title.  Miss  Jones  had  won  the  first  set  rather  easily  and 
added  the  first  game  of  the  second  set  to  her  score  when  Miss 
Moore's  physician  interfered  with  the  play  and  refused  to  let  the 
plucky  little  champion  continue  the  hopeless  struggle.  Miss 
Jones  was  too  sportsmanlike  to  take  the  match  by  default,  and 
offered  to  play  it  over  again  later,  but  Miss  Moore  naturally 
refused  this  offer,  and  Miss  Jones  was  declared  the  champion  by 
default. 

In  the  doubles  Miss  Jones  and  Miss  Atkinson  had  little  diffi- 
culty in  repeating  their  victory  of  last  season,  and  they  did  not 
lose  a  set.  Their  defeat  of  Miss  Moore  and  Miss  Neely  in  the 
semi-final  round  by  6/2,  6/0  was  quite  unexpected.  In  the 
mixed  doubles  Miss  Moore  and  W.  C.  Grant  had  no  other  pair 
of  their  skill  to  meet,  for  Miss  Jones,  Miss  Atkinson  and  Miss 
Neely  were  all  out  of  this  event. 

An  open  event  in  men's  singles  was  held  also  in  connection 
with  the  championship  programme,  and  the  list  of  entries  in- 
cluded all  of  the  best  Philadelphia  players,  except  Clothier.  In 
the  finals  Grant  met  Carpenter,  and  the  clever  style  of  the  Phila-

delphian  proved  to  be  too  much  for  him,  and  he  retired  after  the 
third  set  without  finishing  out  the  match.     Scores:

The  Indoor  Championship  Tournament 

The  fourth  annual  tournament  for  the  indoor  championship  of 
America,  was  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A.  at 
the  Seventh  Regiment  armory,  New  York,  during  the  week  of 
February  15,  1903.  The  entry-list  was  a  strong  one,  but  was 
materially  weakened  by  the  defaults  of  H.  F.  Allen,  of  Philadel- 
phia, J.  P.  Paret,  of  New  York,  last  year's  indoor  champion,  and 
one  or  two  of  the  strongest  teams  in  the  doubles.  However, 
there  was  much  excellent  play  and  the  meeting  was  even  more 
successful  than  its  predecessors. 

The  field  was  sifted  out  rapidly,  the  only  important  matches 
that  preceded  the  finals  being  those  between  C.  Cragin  and  Pell 
and  Grant  and  Forbes.     Pell  gave  the  older  Cragin  a  hard  rub 


.PALIJINGS    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  71 

and  came  very  close  to  beating  him,  allhough  his  lack  of  tour- 
nament experience  finally  caused  his  uridoing;  while  Grant  beat 
the  veteran  Forbes  because  of  his  terrific  speed  and  Forbes's 
lack  of  practice.  In  the  finals,  Cragin  proved  to  be  no  match 
for  Grant,  and  the  latter  won  in  three  straight  sets.  These  two 
men  were  the  runners-up  in  the  last  two  previous  indoor  tourna- 
ments. 

The  doubles  furnished  a  better  entry  than  the  singles,  including 
Leonard  and  Clothier,  the  intercollegiate  champions.  Little  and 
Forbes  and  the  Cragin  brothers,  besides  Grant  and  LeRoy,  the 
champions  of  last  season.  The  Cragins  required  the  full  three 
sets  to  dispose  of  Little  and  P'orbes,  who  put  up  a  strong  game 
despite  their  lack  of  practice,  and  in  the  finals  they  were  beaten 
by  Grant  and  LeRoy  .after  a  close  four-set  match,  the  last  two 
sets  of  which  were  played  out  on  an  even  basis  aftej  the  old 
champions  had  won  the  first  two  sets  easily. 

The  success  of  the  two  young  indoor  experts.  Grant  and  LeRoy. 
in  both  singles  and  doubles,  was  clearly  the  result  of  hard 
practice,  for  these  two  players  have  been  in  constant  indoor 
training  on  board  courts  winter  after  winter,  and  were  much 
better  fitted  to  play  indoor  championship  matches  than  any  of 
the  other  contestants,  unless  it  be  C.  Cragin.  who  has  also  prac- 
ticed pretty  steadily  indoors.     Scores  :

SECriONAL  CHAMPIONSHIPS 


THE  EASTERN  CHAMPIONSHIPS  AT  LONGWOOD. 

The  annual  tournament  of  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  was 
held  at  Longwood  (Boston),  Mass.,  during  the  week  of  July 
28.  Unusual  interest  attached  to  the  meeting  last  season  because 
it  furnished  the  first  appearance  of  the  Doherty  brothers,  who 
were  preparing  for  the  International  matches  the  week  after. 
With  Earned  holding  the  challenge  cup,  and  Whitman  and 
Wright  both  entered  for  the  singles,  and  the  Wrenn  brothers  for 
the  doubles,  the  country's  strongest  resources  were  matched 
against  the  visitors  the  week  before  the  final  test  was  to  come. 
H.  L.  Doherty,  who  had  just  won  the  English  championship  a 
month  before,  made  a  rather  poor  impression  at  his  first  appear- 
ance against  H.  H.  Hackett,  who  took  the  first  set  from  him, 
and  kept  him  busy  during  the  rest  of  the  match.  In  the  first 
round,  R.  C.  Seaver  took  the  Englishman  fairly  by  surprise  and 
won  a  love  set  before  Doherty  got  started  in  his  play,  after 
which  the  visitor  held  the  match  safe.  In  the  third  round,  Do- 
herty defaulted  to  Ware,  while  his  brother  after  beating  Wright 
in  straight  sets  and  taking  the  first  set  of  his  match  against 
Stevens,  defaulted  also,  the  Englishmen  making  the  announce- 
ment that  they  did  not  intend  to  play  through,  and  had  entered 
only  for  the  practice  and  to  try  for  the  doubles.  As  soon  as  the 
Englishmen  defaulted.  Whitman  also  dropped  out  of  the  singles. 

With  three  of  the  most  formidable  contestants  out,  as  well  as 
Wright,  the  struggle  was  left  to  Clothier,  Ward,  Ware  and 
Irving  Wright.  Ward  beat  Ware  in  five  sets,  but  succumbed  to 
Clothier  in  the  finals  after  a  clever  four-set  match  the  next 
day.  The  biggest  surprise  of  the  week  came  when  Clothier  beat 
Earned  in  the  challenge  round  by  three  sets  to  one  in  a  clever 
match  that  cost  Earned  heavily.  While  the  champion  was 
certaintly  not  at  his  best.  Clothier  clearly  outplay  him  at  times, 
and  Earned  found  him  a  very  difficult  man  to  pass  at  the  net,  his 
low  volleying  being  so  clever. 

In  the  doubles,  there  were  only  four  teams  of  championship 
calibre,  and  they  came  together  in  the  semi-finals.  The  Wrenn 
brothers  beat  Clothier  and  Wright  by  three  sets  to  one,  and 
the  Doherty  brothers  beat  Ware  and  Earned  by  a  similar  score. 
In  the  finals,  the  Britishers  came  against  the  Wrenn  brothers, 
whom  many  believed  to  be  the  strongest  of  the  American  doubles 


78  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

combinations,    and    a    brilliant    four-set    match    followed.      The 

Wrenns  got  the  first  set  and  came  within  a  point  or  two  of  taking 

the  second  as  well,  only  to  finally  lose  it  by  7/5  and  then  fall 

steadily  behind,  the  visitors  taking  the  last  two  sets  by  6/2,  6/2. 

This  victory  gave  the  Doherty  brothers  the  right  to  play  in  the 

championship  finals  at  Newport,  as  Eastern  champions  in  doubles.

THE  WESTERN   CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENTS. 

The  Western  championships  last  season  were  held  in  two 
sections,  one  for  men  and  one  for  women,  but  both  at  the  Ken- 
wood Country  Club,  Chicago.  The  men's  events  were  held  dur- 
ing the  week  of  July  14,  and  the  entry  was  as  good  and  nearly  as 
numerous  as  usual.  Sixty-four  players  entered  the  singles,  and 
the  big  field  was  slowly  weeded  out.  L.  H.  Waidner,  of  Chicago, 
scored  the  first  important  victory  by  beating  R.  G.  Hunt,  of  Cali- 
fornia, and  he  followed  up  this  good  work  by  beating  F.  B.  Alex- 
ander, of  New  York  in  the  semi-finals,  while  Kriegh  Collins, 
several  times  before  the  Western  championship  holder,  beat  E. 
R    Patterson,  of  Canada,  in  the  semi-finals,  and  then  scored  over 


^o  Spalding's  i.awn  tennjs  annual. 

Waidner  with  unexpected  ease,  Waidner  not  coming  even  close 
to  winning  a  single  set.  In  the  challenge  round,  Collins  played 
R.  D.  Little,  of  New  York,  who  won  the  championship  the  year 
before,  and  won  after  a  brilliant  five-set  match,  regaining  his  old 
title  after  an  interval  of  several  years. 

In  the  doubles,  for  the  right  to  play  in  the  final  championship 
series  at  Newport,  Collins  and  Waidner  earned  their  way  rather 
easily  to  the  finals,  while  Alexander  and  Little  had  to  beat  Em- 
erson and  Diehl,  the  crack  team  from  Cincinnati,  in  the  semi- 
finals which  proved  to  be  no  easy  task.  In  the  finals,  the  big- 
gest surprise  of  the  tournament  came  off,  for  Collins  and  Waid- 
ner, who  had  several  times  before  been  beaten  by  the  Eastern 
pair,  beat  Little  and  Alexander  in  the  easiest  kind  of  fashion, 
the  Eastern  pair  winning  only  three  games  in  the  match. 

The  women's  Western  championship  tournament  was  held  the 
first  week  of  September,  and  Miss  Carrie  Neely,  of  Chicago, 
captured  the  all-comers'  singles,  Miss  Closterman,  of  Cincinnati, 
defaulting  in  the  second  set  after  losing  the  first.  In  the  chal- 
lenge round,  however,  Miss  Myrtle  McAteer,  of  Pittsburg,  beat 
Miss  Neely  by  two  sets  to  one,  the  last  SrCt  being  a  love  one  for 
the  cup-holder.     Scores.

MIDDLE  STATES  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT. 

The  Middle  States  Championship  tournament  at  the  Orange 
Lawn  Tennis  Club,  during  the  week  of  June  30,  drew  its  usual 
fine  list  of  entries,  although  the  women's  singles  filled  even  better 
than  did  the  men's  singles,  which  was  a  rather  unusual  occur- 
rence, and  the  men's  doubles  were  also  of  unusual  merit.  In  the 
principal  event  of  the  week,  Holcomb  Ward  beat  Richard  Stevens 
in  the  second  round  in  easy  fashion  to  the  surprise  of  the  stu-

dents  of  lawn  tennis  form,  and  Millett  beat  E.  P.  Larned  in  a 
close  three-set  match.  Ward  put  Millett  out  in  the  semi-finals, 
and  in  the  finals  he  also  beat  Montgomery  Ogden,  of  Princeton, 
in  the  closest  match  of  the  event,  Ogden  winning  one  exciting 
set,  the  second,  by  10/8.  Champion  W.  A.  Larned,  the  previous 
winner  of  the  title,  defaulted  in  the  challenge  round,  and  the 
Middle  States  Championship  went  to  Ward.  In  the  doubles,  the 
Wrenn  brothers  had  a  close  match  in  the  first  round  against  Mil- 
lett and  Forbes,  finally  winning  by  a  narrow  margin,  only  to 
succumb  in  the  semi-finals  to  Davis  and  Ward,  the  national 
champions  at  that  time.  Little  and  Alexander  l3eat  Whitman 
and  Ware  in  the  other  semi-final  after  another  close  three-set 
match,  but  were  beaten  in  turn  by  Davis  and  Ward  in  the  finals 
in  straight  sets.  The  women's  singles  brought  out  some  of  the 
best  play  of  the  week.  Miss  Marion  Jones  beat  Miss  Juliette 
Atkinson  in  the  first  round,  the  ex-champion  making  a  poor 
.showing  against  the  champion,  and  Miss  Jones  also  put  out  an- 
other ex-champion,  Miss  Winona  Closterman,  of  Cincinnati,  in 
the  semi-finals,  only  to  lose  in  the  finals  to  Miss  Maud  Banks, 
after  a  clever  three-set  match.     Scores:

THE  SOUTHERN  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  Southern  Championship  tournament  was  held  as 
usual  at  the  Bachelors'  Club,  Washington,  during  the  week  of 
May  26.  The  entry-list  was  even  better  than  usual,  and  the 
women's  events  attracted  one  of  the  best  entries  seen  in  any 
tournament  of  the  year.  In  the  singles  for  men,  Davidson  and 
Paret,  two  former  Southern  champions,  each  with  two  "legs"' 
on  the  challenge  cup,  came  together  in  the  preliminary  round, 
and  Davidson  won  rather  easily.  He  was  beaten  in  the  finals 
by  Franklin  Geoghegan,  another  Washingtonian,  however,  and 
Geoghegan  met  R.  D.  Little  the  previous  holder  of  the  title,  the 
next  day  in  the  challenge  round.  The  Washingtonian  had  had 
too  little  experience  against  such  formidable  players  as  Little, 
and  made  a  poor  showing,  none  of  the  three  sets  being  close.  One 
feature  of  the  singles  was  the  success  of  Sem.  Russ,  of  Texas, 
who  made  his  first  Northern  appearance  in  this  meeting  and  beat 
two  of  the  strongest  of  the  local  players  before  he  succumbed. 
Paret  an.d  Grand  won  the  doubles,  and  Paret  and  Miss  Mane 
Wimer,  of  Washington,  won  the  mixed  doubles.  In  the  women's 
singles.  Miss  Bessie  Moore  beat  Miss  Marie  Wimer  in  the  first 
round  after  the  closest  kind  of  a  match,  while  in  the  finals,  Miss 
Maud  Banks  forced  her   even  closer  before  she  was   defeated.

England  since  the  title  was  revived,  was  held  at  the  Hartford 
Golf  Club  grounds  during  the  week  of  June  17.     There  were  a 
number  of  visiting  players,   but   still   the   home  contingent  had 
matters  their  own  way  in  the  singles,  and  James  Terry  and  Frank 
E.  Howard,  both  of  Hartford,  came  together  in  the  finals,  and 
played  five  close   sets.     Terry  won  out  in  the   end  and  played 
Clarence  Hobart,  the  previous  championship  holder,  in  the  chal- 
lenge round,  but  failed  to  get  a  set  from  his  formidable  adver- 
sary.    Together  Terry   and   Howard   won  the  doubles,   but   not

ner in  the  third  round  but  was  finally  beaten,  while  Waidner  was 
in  turn  beaten  by  Little  in  the  semi-finals.    Little  had  small  diffi-

of  the  Pacific  States  was  held  on  the  courts  of  Hotel  Rafael,  at 
San  Rafael,  California,  during  the  week  beginning  September 
2.  The  retirement  in  1901  of  the  time-honored  challenger  trophy

George  F.  Wliitticy  default  in  the  challenge  round  for  the  sin- 
gles championship,  hut  the  Whitney  brothers  also  retired.  Their 
absence  left  the  field  open  for  the  younger  men,  and  the  entry- 
list  included  much  promising  material.  Robert  N.  Whitney  was 
put  out  in  the  first  round  by  Percy  Murdock  after  a  close  three- 
set  match,  and  Murdock  in  turn  was  beaten  by  W.  B.  Collier. 
The  latter  reached  the  final  round  against  Louis  R.  Freeman,  of 
Pasadena,  only  to  go  down  in  short  order  before  the  fast  net 
play  and  aggressive  ground-stroke  of  the  champion  from  the 
southern  part  of  the  State.  Freeman  proved  himself  to  be  quite 
invincible  and  not  one  of  his  sets  reached  deuce  nor  did  he  lose 
a  set  to  any  of  the  different  opponents  he  met  in  his  path  to  the 
championship  title. 

In  the  doubles.  Freeman  played  with  Alfonso  Bell  and  the  pair 
won  after  two  close  matches.  Robert  \V^hitney  and  Thomas 
Driscoll,  two  former  coast  champions,  were  beaten  in  the  first 
round  after  a  terrific  five-set  match  by  Collier  and  Crowell,  but 
Smith  and  McGavin  proved  too  strong  for  this  veteran  pair  and 
earned  their  way  into  the  final  against  Freeman  and  Bell.  The 
deciding  match  for  the  doubles  championship  lasted  for  the  full 
five  sets  before  Smith  and  McGavin  were  forced  to  acknoAvledge 
defeat.  The  Misses  Sutton  once  more  proved  invincible  in  the 
women's  events.    Scores :

THE  METROPOLITAN  CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
The  annual  tournament  for  the  Metropolitan  Championships 
was  held  as  usual  by  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  in  New  York, 
during  the  week  of  June  23.  The  new  courts  of,  the  club  were  in 
as  good  condition  as  could  be  expected  when  the  short  time  al- 
lowed for  their  preparation  since  the  club  moved,  but  still  they 
could  not  compare  with  the  old  courts  of  the  organization.  The 
tournament  was  full  of  surprises  from  one  end  to  the  other.  In 
the  second  round,  F.  G.  Anderson,  of  Brooklyn,  a  former  Can- 
adian expert,  pushed  S.  C.  Millett,  one  of  the  former  Metropolitan 
championship  holders,  hard  for  the  victory.  Anderson  captured 
the  first  set  and  forced  the  play  in  the  deciding  set  up  to  8/6 
before  he  acknowledged  defeat.  Semp  Russ,  the  Texas  champion, 
beat  C.  C.  Kelly  in  the  semi-final  easily,  and  then  made  a  very 
good  showing  against  H.  H.  Hackett  in  the  finals.  Hackett 
caused  the  biggest  surprise  of  the  week  in  the  challenge  round, 
by  beating  R.  D.  Little,  the  former  holder  of  the  title,  by  three 
straight  sets.     Scores :

THE   INTER-STATE   TOURNAMENT   AT    CINCINNATI. 

The  annual  Inter-state  tournament  of  the  Ohio  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  was  held  as  usual  at  the  Avondle  Athletic  Asso- 
cition  grounds,  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  during  the  week  of  July 
12.  The  local  committee  was  a  good  deal  handicapped  by  bad 
weather  but  despite  the  rain,  the  events  were  all  completed  suc- 
cessfully, although  Kriegh  Collins,  the  challenger,  was  required 
to  play  more  than  a  full  day's  share  of  sets  in  order  to  complete 
the  schedule  in  time,  and  his  chances  for  the  title  were  ruined 
by  this  over-tax.  The  entry-list  was  specially  fine  both  in  quan- 
tity and  quality,  and  the  players  represented  almost  every  section 
of  the  country.  The  success  of  Nat.  Emerson,  the  popular  Cin- 
cinnati player,  was  a  welcome  surprise  to  the  local  enthusiasts, 
and  when  Emerson  beat  E.  P.  Fischer,  of  New  York,  they  were 
delighted.  The  local  favorite,  with  Ernest  Diehl  in  the  doubles, 
then  added  to  his  laurels  by  winning  the  doubles,  after  victories 
over  Collins  and  Waidner,  the  Western  champion,  and  several 
other  strong  teams. 

In  the  singles,  Fischer  was  decidedly  out  of  form,  but  his  de- 
feat by  Emerson  was  chiefly  due  to  the  latter's  clever  play.  The 
home  crack  was  beaten  in  the  semi-finals  by  Hunt,  who  had  been 
showing  steady  improvement  with  every  week,  but  Hunt  was 
not  able  to  win  a  set  from  Collins  in  the  finals.  The  bad  weather 
crowded  two  days'  play  into  one,  and  Collins  was  required  to 
play  the  finals  against  Hunt  in  the  morning,  and  the  challenge 
match  against  Little  in  the  afternoon. .  In  the  latter,  he  won  the 
first  two  sets  but  gradually  wore  out  his  strength  and  was  finally 
beaten  in  a  five-set  match  that  he  certainly  must  have  won  if  he 
had  started  on  even  terms  with  the  cup-holder.  Little's  play  im- 
proved toward  the  end,  but  Collins  held  him  safe  as  long  as  his 
strength  lasted. 

The  women's  doubles  furnished  another  surprise,  for  Miss 
Maud  Banks,  of  New  York,  beat  Miss  Neely,  of  Chicago,  and 
Miss  Winona  Closterman,  a  former  national  champion,  and  won 
first  honors.     Scores:

Association.  This  gave  him  permanent  possession  of  the  cup. 
With  his  partner,  Ike  Raymond,  of  Lincoln,  Neb.,  he  also  won 
the  championship  in  doubles  for  the  third  successive  year,  and 
they  were  given  permanent  possession  of  the  doubles  cup.  The 
tournament  was  held  on  the  grounds  of  the  Sioux  City  Tennis 
Club  during  the  week  of  August  12.  Weather  conditions  were 
against  the  tournament  but  the  fine  condition  of  the  courts  made 
fast  play  possible. 

George  Howell,  of  Sioux  City,  defeated  J.  P.  Magee,  of  Omaha, 
in  the  final  round  of  men's  singles  by  6/3,  6/3,  6/4.  In  the  final

THE  WESTERN  INTER-STATE  TOURNEY. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  Inter- State  Championship  of 
Iowa,  Nebraska,  Kansas  and  Missouri  was  held  during  the  week 
of  August  18,  under  the  auspices  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A.  The 
matches  were  played  on  the  splendid  grounds  of  the  Omaha 
Field  Club,  and  the  enthusiasm  was  greater  than  at  any  of  the 
preceding  tournaments  of  this  series.  In  all  there  were  forty 
entries  in  the  singles  and  sixteen  teams  in  the  doubles,  which 
is  said  to  be  the  largest  entry  ever  secured  for  a  tournament 
held  west  of  Chicago,  while  the  tournament  was  also  said  to  be 
the  most  successful  ever  held  in  that  section. 

Among  the  entries  were  W.  Gordon  Parker,  formerly  one  of 
the  crack  players  of  the  country  when  his  home  was  in  the  East, 
E.  M.  Ashcroft  and  C.  S.  Peters,  of  Chicago,  besides  a  full  rep- 
resentation from  the  western  section.  The  career  of  Parker  was 
watched  interestedly  by  those  who  knew  of  his  former  successes 
in  the  East,  but  he  did  not  make  so  good  a  showing  as  had  Leen 
expected.  He  put  out  Young  and  Clarke  of  Omaha,  and  then  fell 
a  victim  to  the  clever  play  of  Farnsworth  of  Grand  Island. 
Farnsworth  subsequently  reached  the  linal  round,  but  here  met 
his  Waterloo  in  a  brilliant  rive  set  match  agaiifst  F.  R.  Sanderson, 
of  Galesburg,  111.,  after  leading  by  two  sets  to  one.  N.  A.  Web- 
ster, the  winner  of  1901,  defjiulted  in  the  chaHenge  round  to 
Sanderson,  who  took  possession  of  the  trophy.     Scores :

in  its  old  home  at  the  Sedgewick  Farm  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  dur-

entertained  as  royally  as  ever,  and  the  meeting  was  a  great 
success  from  every  point  of  view.  F.  B.  Alexander  captured  first 
honors  rather  easily,  having  only  one  close  match,  that  in  the 
finals  against  Irving  Wright  when  the  latter  took  one  set  in 
four.  There  was  some  misunderstanding  in  regard  to  the  chal- 
lenge match  between  last  year's  holder  of  the  title,  E.  P.  Fischer, 
and  the  local  committee,  which  resulted  in  the  default  of  the 
latter,  and  the  new  cup  went  to  Alexander.  With  A.  D.  Jenney, 
of  Syracuse,  an  old  Princeton  college  expert,  Alexander  also  won 
the  doubles.     Scores  :

CONNECTICUT    STATE    CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  annual  open  tournament  of  the  Norfolk  (Conn.)  Lawn 
Tennis  Club  was  held  during  the  week  of  August  4,  with  the 
usual  large  list  of  entries.  The  local  committee  caused  consid- 
erable confusion  by  making  a  new  ruling  that  the  holder  of  the 
Bridgman  Challenge  Cup  (which  was  advertised  to  go  to  the 
player  winning  it  three  times)  would  have  to  play  through  the 
tournament  or  default  for  the  cup,  although  he  won  his  title 
to  it  by  challenging  the  previous  holder  and  defeating  him.  This 
decision  was  protested  by  J.  P.  Paret,  the  previous  winner,  who 
did   not   enter   to   play   through,   and    when   the   officials    of   the

U.S.N.L.T.A.  questioned  the  right  of  the  local  committee  to 
alter  the  conditions  governing  the  cup,  the  Norfolk  committee 
claimed  that  the  tournament  never  was  for  the  state  champion- 
ship, although  generally  advertised  so  for  two  years,  and  that 
they  reserved  the  right  to  make  such  rules  as  they  pleased. 

Two  other  former  holders  of  the  cup,  Lewis  Perry  and  W.  K. 
Gillett,  each  of  whom  had  won  it  twice,  were  entered,  but  Perry 
beat  Gillett  easily  and  Hugh  Tallant  then  beat  Perry  after  a 
close  struggle  in  the  semi-final  round.  Tallant  won  the  singles, 
and  under  the  committee's  decision  took  the  Bridgman  Cup, 
while  Perry  and  Blagden  again  won  the  doubles.     Scores:         ,

INVITATION  TOURNAMENTS 


INVITATION   DOUBLES  AT  WESTCHESTER. 

The  Westchester  Country  Club,  which  used  to  hold  invitation 
tournaments    many   years    ago,    revived    the    tennis    interest    last 
season,  and  held  a   round   robin   invitation   tournament  on  their 
courts  in  Westchester  County,  N.  Y.,   during  the  week  of  July 
7.     Five  teams  accepted  the  club's  invitations,  and  they  included 
all  the  best  talent  in  doubles  that  was  available  at  the  time.    The 
full  schedule  required  ten  best-three-in-five-set  matches  and  two 
were  played  each  day.     The  first  crucial  match  came  in  the  third 
round,  when  the  Wrenn  brothers  beat  Whitman  and  Ware  after 
five  close  sets,   the   fourth  at    10/8  being  exceptionally   exciting. 
Whitman  and  Ware  beat  Ward  and  Davis  in  the  next  round  in 
a  still  closer  match,  three  of  the  five  sets  being  deuce  and  vantage 
struggles.     The  champions  had  a  chance  by  beating  the  Wrenn 
brothers  in  the  final  round  to  tie  the  score  with  all  three  of  the 
leaders    even,   but  they   failed   to   pull   off   the    victory.    Scores:

THE  CRESCENT  INVITATION  TOURNAMENT. 
The  Crescent  Athletic  Club,  of  Brooklyn,  held  its  annual  invi- 
tation tournament  during  the  week  of  June  23  on  the  club 
grounds  at  Bay  Ridge,  Brooklyn.  Five  players  accepted  the 
club's  invitations,  and  they  included  the  flower  of  the  American 
second  class.  Beals  Wright,  who  was  easily  the  strongest  in 
the  field,  according  to  previous  rankings,  went  through  the 
week  without  losing  a  match,  and  only  one  set  was  scored  against 
him,  that  by  Clothier  in  the  second  round.  Hobart's  play  was  a 
disappointment,  for  he  not  only  lost  to  Little  and  Wright  but 
also  a  set  each  to  Clothier  and  Ward.  Little  finished  second, 
with  three  victories  and  one  defeat.  There  were  also  a  series 
of  exhibition  matches  in  doubles  during  the  week,  a  summary 
of  which  follows  with  the  results  of  the  regular  tournament

THE  SOUTHAMPTON  TOURNAMENT. 

The   Meadow   Club,  of  Southampton,   N.   Y.,  held  its  annual 
invitation   tournament   during  the   week  of  August   11,   and  the 
meeting  was  doubly  important  last  season  because  of  the  pres- 
ence of  Larned,  Whitman,  the  Doherty  brothers  and  Dr.   Pim. 
The  tournament  was  run  on  the  usual  "knock-out"  plan,  and  the 
rounds  progressed  rapidly.    The  Doherty  brothers  both  scratched 
in  the  semi-final  round  and  Larned  met  Pim  in  the  finals,  beating 
him  even  worse  than  in  the  International  tournament  the  week 
before.     In  the  doubles.  Whitman  and  Larned  played  together,

THE   NAHANT   CLUB'S   TOURNAMENT. 

The  memorable  series  of  invitation  to^irnaments  run  by  the 
Nahant  Club,  of  Nahant,  Mass.,  was  resumed  last  season  after 
a  lapse  of  a  number  of  years,  and  a  most  successful  meeting 
was  held  during  the  week  of  July  21.  A  new  plan  was  adopted, 
sixteen  men  being  invited  to  play  in  the  singles,  and  these  play- 
ing off  in  the  regular  manner  until  the  semi-finals  were  reached, 
when  the  last  four  held  a  three-out-of-five-set  round  robin. 
Earned,  Chace,  Davis  and  Stevens  all  defaulted,  and  this  left 
the  entry-list  materially  weakened,  but  Whitman,  Wright,  Ware, 
Ward,  Clothier  and  several  other  strong  players  were  still  left 
in  the  field.  Wright  beat  Ward  in  a  terrific  four-set  match  in 
the  second  round  and  Wright,  Ware,  Clothier  and  Whitman 
survived  for  the  round  robin.  Whitman  and  Wright  made  good 
their  reputations  by  beating  the  other  two  in  the  first  round,  and 
then  Whitman  beat  Wright  in  a  close  five-set  match,  after  the 
score  had  been  two  sets  to  one  against  him.  Clothier  beat  Ware 
for  third   place   in   straight   sets.    Scores :

The  Woodlawn  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  of  Chicago,  held  an  invi-

vented Kriegh  Collins,  the  crack  player  of  Chicago,  from  taking 
part  in  the  meeting,  but  the  list  of  seven  players  who  accepted 
the  club's  invitations  included  nearly  all  of  the  other  strong 
players  of  Chicago.  Rain  interrupted  the  play  a  good  deal  during

FOREIGN  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENTS 


THE   ENGLISH   CHAMPIONSHIP   TOURNAMENT. 

The  English  Championship  tournament  was  held  as  usual  on 
the  courts  of  the  All-England  Club,  at  Wimbledon  (near  Lon- 
don), England,  during  the  weeks  of  June  23  and  30.  There  was 
an  entry  of  forty-two  players  in  the  singles,  including  all  of 
England's  best  and  the  pick  of  the  Irish  players,  with  the  ex- 
ception of  Dr.  Pim,  and  a  number  of  continental  experts.  There 
were  no  American  players  entered,  however.  In  the  singles, 
R.  F.  Doherty,  many  times  champion,  decided  not  to  play 
through  the  tournament  when  he  found  that  he  was  drawn  on 
the  same  side  as  his  younger  brother,  to  whom  he  had  decided 
to  default,  and  H.  L.  Doherty  carried  the  honors  of  the  family 
through  to  the  championship  once  more. 

The  championship  title  turned  on  the  match  between  H.  L.  Do- 
herty and  H.  S.  Mahony,  in  which  the  latter  won  the  first  two 
sets  and  came  within  an  ace  of  taking  the  match  in  three  straight 
sets,  but  he  was  used  up  before  the  fourth  set  had  gone  far  and 
defaulted.  Doherty  then  beat  M.  J.  G.  Ritchie  in  the  finals  in 
straight  sets,  after  the  latter  had  beaten  the  famous  S.  H.  Smith, 
three  sets  to  one  in  the  other  semi-finals.  In  the  challenge  round, 
Doherty  lost  one  set  to  A.  W.  Gore,  the  previous  holder,  but 
evened  matters  up  by  taking  the  next  set  to  love.  In  the  doubles, 
S.  H.  Smith  and  F.  L.  Riseley  beat  G.  W.  Hillyard  and  C.  H. 
Cazalet  in  a  hard  five-set  match  in  the  finals,  and  then  chal- 
lenged the  famous  Doherty  brothers  in  the  championship  round 
for  their  title.  This  match  was  the  feature  of  the  meeting,  and 
the  most  surprising  of  the  year  in  English  tennis  annals.  With 
Smith  at  the  base-line  and  Riseley  at  the  net,  the  challengers 
were  not  thought  to  have  much  change  for  success  against  the 
invincible  Dohertys,  but  this  curious  combination  finally  suc- 
ceeded in  wresting  the  championship  away  from  the  brothers 
after  a  wonderful  five-set  match  with  the  score  at  11/9  in  the  last.

THE  IRISH   CHAMPIONSHIP   TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  tournament  for  Irish  Championship  was  held  as 
usual  on  the  courts  in  Fitzwilliam  Square,  Dublin,  during  the 
week  of  May  26.  The  entry  was  poorer  than  usual,  for  the  Dub- 
lin meeting  has  generally  been  considered  abroad  as  next  in 
importance  to  the  English  championships  at  Wimbledon.  Last 
year,  however,  there  were  fewer  entries  and  fewer  good  players. 
In  the  final  round  of  the  singles,  H.  L.  Doherty  met  S.  H.  Smith, 
the  famous  base-line  expert,  and  beat  him  easily  in  straight  sets, 
after  which  his  older  brother  defaulted  the  championship  title 
to  him.  In  the  doubles,  the  Doherty  brothers  easily  held  their 
title,  beating  their  challengers,  the  Sweetman  brothers,  in  straight 
sets.     Scores :

THE  FRENCH  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT 
The  annual  tournament  for  the  French  Championships  was 
held  in  Paris  during  the  Easter  holidays  last  year,  and  produced 
some  exceptionally  brilliant  play.  The  entry  list  was  one  of 
the  best  that  had  ever  been  secured  for  a  French  tournament,  and 
the  play  was  of  the  highest  order.  In  the  smgles,  the  biggest 
surprise  was  the  success  of  Max  Decugis,  a  French  player  who 
had  previously  never  done  anything  remarkable.  At  Pans  last 
year,  however,  he  beat  R.  B.  Houg^i  and  G.  M.  Simond,  two  well- 
known  crack  English  players,  both  easily,  and  then  came  very 
close  to  beating  M.  J.  G.  Ritchie,  after;vard  the  runner-up  in  the 
English  championship  meeting.  Decugis  took  the  first  two  sets 
from  Ritchie  but  gave  out  in  the  third  and  was  finally  beaten  in 
a  five-set  match.  In  the  doubles,  the  Doherty  brothers  again  won 
the  championship  without  much  difficulty.  Scores:

THE   CANADIAN   CHAMPIONSHIP   TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  open  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Canada 
was  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A.  at  Niagara- 
on-the-Lake,  Ont.,  during  the  week  of  July  7.     E.  R.  Patterson, 
perhaps  the  strongest  of  the  Canadian  players,  beat  Rueben  Hunt, 
of    California,    in   the   first    round    of   the    singles,    while   Irving 
Wright  caused  another  surprise  by  beating  E.  P.  Fischer  in  the 
first    round   after   a    long   close   match.     In   the   finals,   the   two 
Wright   brothers   came   together  and   the  younger   won   one   set 
from  his  clever  brother  who  then  took  the  Canadian  champion- 
ship title  by  default  from  W.  A.  Earned,  last  year's  holder.     The

THE   NIAGARA   INTERNATIONAL   TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  International  tournament  given  by  the  Canadian 
Lawn  Tennis  Association  was  held  as  usual  during  the  week  ot 
August  25  at  Niagara-on-the-Lake,  Ont.  The  usual  Canadian 
surprise  was  furnished  by  the  defeat  of  Kriegh  Collins,  the 
Western  championship  holder,  by  H.  H.  Hackett,  who  aft^erward 
reached  the  finals  and  played  Beals  Wright  four  sets  before  he 
was  beaten.  In  the  doubles,  Beals  Wright  and  Kriegh  Collins 
easily  took  first  honors.  None  of  the  Canadians  won  any  of  the 
prizes.     Scores :

AMERICAN  DEVELOPMENT  IN  LAWN  TENNIS 

The  promised  tests  of  International  skill  at  lawn  tennis  last 
season  brought  up  new  questions  and  ^^^^^''^''I'^J^^^I^Tl 
be  considered  in  the  light  of  the  developments  of  iQOi,  of  the 
success  of  Davis  and  Ward  in  England  of  the  altered  methods 
of  Larned  and  others  in  American  matches,  and  of  the  victory 
of  Gore  for  the  English  championship  two  years  ago.  Lawn 
tennis  theorists  find  themselves  in  a  most  uncertain  state  ot 
mind  when  these  facts  are  duly  digested  for  Gore  s  victory 
suggests  actual  retrogression  among  the  leaders  abroad,  and  the 
successes  of  the  Americans  point  almost  to  an  International 
superiority  that  probably  does  not  exist.    _  .      ^^^^â<. 

That  the  English  have  not  made  material  progress  in  recent 
vears,  while  Americans  have  been  improving  seems  to  me  due 
to  the  fact  that  our  cousins  still  rely  chiefly  upon  execution  as 
the  main  element  of  their  skill.  Britons  aim  chiefly  at  perfect 
execution  of  strokes,  while  Americans  study  tactics  hrst  and 
sacrifice  execution  for  position  every  time.  During  the  last 
few  years,  such  pure  "stroke  players"  as  Gore  and  Smith  have 
been  frequent  winners  abroad,  and  last  season  the  chmax  was 
reached  when  Gore  won  the  English  championship  oyer  a  held 
of  formidable  proportions,  including  both  of  the  Dohertys  and 
the  flower  of  the  English  experts.  His  mere  ability  to  execute 
strokes  wore  down  the  more  brilliant  combination  play  ot  other 
antagonists  as  Smith  had  done  so  often  the  previous  season. 
Excellent  judges  who  have  studied  the  play  of  both  find  most 
of  the  same  characteristics  in  Gore's  play  and  that  of  Lawtord, 
who  became  so  famous  and  so  irresistible  in  England  twenty 
years  a<^o  and  not  a  few  believe  that  the  ground-strokes  of  to- 
day are  no  better  than  the  best  of  fifteen  years  ago. 

These  methods  have  not  been  profitable  in  America  for  several 
years  Gore  was  badly  beaten  here  only  two  seasons  ago,  and 
we  had  another  test  last  season  of  the  value  of  stroke-playing 
when  Hobart  returned  to  competition.  He  declared  after  a 
season  among  the  younger  and  newer  experts  of  to-day  that  he 
did  not  see  any  material  advance  in  the  gam.e  since  his  previous 
retirement.  Yet  Hobart  was  among  the  top  flight  _  of  the 
American  leaders  when  we  last  saw  him  in  competition,  and 
last  year  he  was  distinctly  inferior  to  all  of  the  first-class  men. 
His   method,  like   that  of   Gore,   is  to  kill   from  the  base-line, 


178  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

while  the  more  advanced  school  of  the  American  experts  believe 
that  a  killing  stroke  should  be  made  off  the  ground  only  with 
an  opponent  at  the  net.  With  both  back  at  court,  the  forcing 
stroke  should  be  used  for  an  opening,  and  followed  by  a  killing 
stroke  from  the  volleying  position.  Hobart's  method  earned 
a  goodly  share  of  success  ten  years  ago  when  he  was  in  the 
heyday  of  his  success,  but  then  our  American  leaders  were  still 
worshipping  at  the  shrine  of  erratic  brilliancy.  For  the  last 
few  years  they  have  been  imbibing  more  and  more  of  the 
English  ideas  of  hitting  the  ball,  and  their  execution  has  been 
growing  steadily  better  in  consequence. 

There  is  an  old  English  maxim  in  lawn  tennis  laid  down  by 
one  of  the  English  authorities  on  the  game,  Wilifred  Baddeley. 
I  think,  who  declared  that  in  championship  play  a  man  should 
never  come  to  rest  between  the  base-line  and  the  service-line. 
Upon  this  substantial  corner-stone  rests  the  whole  structure 
of  modern  tennis,  and  without  it  the  net  game  would  fall  like 
a  house  of  cards.  Before  this,  we  find  generally  advanced  by 
English  theorists  the  idea  that  a  player  should  always  establish 
a  base  of  operations  to  which  he  should  return  after  every, 
stroke.  Then  came  Baddeley  with  his  plan  for  two  bases  of  oper- 
ations, one  for  volleying  and  the  other  for  base-line  play.  Amer- 
icans have  accepted  this  theory  in  developing  the  net  game,  but 
they  have  carried  it  very  much  further.  To  come  to  rest  in  the 
forbidden  territory  between  the  base-line  and  the  service-line, 
which  includes  practically  all  of  the  back  half  of  the  court,  is 
pretty  likely  to  prove  an  expert  player's  undoing,  but  the  danger 
does  not  stop  there.  Modern  American  tactics  make  it  impossi- 
ble for  a  volleyer  to  hang  so  far  back  as  the  service-line,  and 
unless  a  player  comes  in  much  closer  than  that  to  volley,  he  is 
soon  cut  up.  Unless  he  returns  very  much  back  of  the  base- 
line for  ground-strokes,  too,  he  soon  finds  the  ball  at  his  feet 
and  in  the  worst  position  to  be  handled. 

In  short,  a  man  is  now  forced  to  play  his  ground-strokes  from 
well  behind  the  base-line  and  his  volleys  from  well  in  front  of 
the  service-line.  In  fast  play,  this  can  be  conservatively  set 
at  eight  feet  either  way,  and  as  the  forbidden  ground  includes 
eighteen  feet  more,  we  have  a  -space  of  some  thirty-four  feet 
that  a  player  must  traverse  in  shifting  from  ground-stroke  play 
to  volley,  and  this  is  the  most  difficult  maneuver  to  bring  off  suc- 
cessfully. In  trying  to  alter  his  position  from  the  back  of  the 
court  to  volley,  a  player  is  still  on  the  move  when  the  ball 
comes  to  him,  and  his  chances  to  return  it  are  weakened.  The 
intention  of  the  opponent  is  to  drive  so  deep  that  he  cannot  get 
up  to  volley  before  the  next  dropping  return  reaches  him  below 


SPALDING  S  LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL.  179 

the  knees,  and  puts  even  his  volleyed  stroke  on  the  defensive. 
We  find  Ward,  Larned  and  Wright  all  three  specially  expert  at 
this  play  and  their  returns  fall  so  short  after  crossing  the  net  that 
to  avoid  getting  the  ball  below  the  knee,  the  opponent  is  drawn 
in  very  close,  and  the  overhead  attack  is  used  with  the  low  lob. 

Practically,  the  secret  of  American  development  lies  in  using 
the  front  and  back  of  the  court  for  placing,  rather  than  the 
sides.  Instead  of  driving  first  to  one  side  and  then  to  the  other, 
the  modern  player  drives  first  short  and  then  deep.  Wright  was 
perhaps  the  first  to  perfect  this  style  in  attacking  a  volleyer,  and 
he  has  shown  rare  judgment  in  dropping  his  return  at  the  oppo- 
nent's feet  when  the  latter  was  coming  up,  and  in  lobbing  low 
over  his  head  if  he  crept  in  close  enough  to  anticipate  the  short 
return.  This  style  of  attack  was  the  natural  outcome  of  ihe 
previous  American  development  of  the  close  net  attack.  Amer- 
ican volleyers  had  been  getting  in  so  close  that  they  were  gen- 
erally open  to  an  overhead  attack  by  a  low  lob,  and  this  play 
threatened  them  so  often  that  they  began  to  hang  just  enough 
to  anticipate  it.  Then  came  the  dropping  stroke  that  reached 
them  at  knee  height  and  this  forced  them  once  more  to  come  in 
closer.  As  matters  stand  now  there  is  still  the  delicate  point  of 
balance  where  a  player  can  best  anticipate  either  the  lob  or  the 
low  return.  Perfect  play  aims  at  reaching  this  point  whenever 
the  player  comes  to  the  front  of  his  court  to  volley. 

Consistently  following  along  these  lines,  Ward  has  developed 
the  same  method  of  front  and  back  attack  against  a  ground- 
stroke  player  from  the  net  position.  For  this  he  uses  the  "stop- 
volley"  and  a  deep  volley  to  the  base-line  alternately  and  de- 
ceives his  adversary  so  long  as  to  which  he  intends  using  that 
the  latter  is  often  lured  into  taking  the  wrong  position  to  handle 
the  return.  Against  this  combination,  the  adversary  is  fre- 
quently drawn  into  Baddley's  forbidden  zone,  for  it  is  practically 
the  only  spot  from  which  either  a  short  or  a  deep  ball  can  be 
reached,  and  once  here  he  is  frequently  forced  to  half-volley, 
which  is  the  most  embarrassing  position  a  lawn  tennis  player 
can  be  drawn  into â he  should  never  half-volley  when  there  is 
a  possibility  of  any  other   stroke  open  to   him. 

The  gradual  development  in  the  use  of  the  front  of  the  court 
for  killing  strokes  which  is  being  steadily  perfected  by  Ward 
and  Wright  has  furnished  wonderful  possibilities  for  shaper 
angles  in  smashing,  and  placing  in  volley  strokes.  The  volleyer's 
position  must  be  closer  tO'  the  net  than  under  former  conditions, 
but  once  there  the  player  commands  a  much  greater  proportion 
of  his  antagonist's  territory  for  every  foot  he  creeps  in  toward 
the  net.    "The  play  of  the  Americans  was  a  revelation ;  it  was  all

dash  and  angles,"  declared  one  English  critic  after  seeing  Davis 
and  Ward  at  Wimbledon  last  June.  Aside  from  the  twist 
service  that  proved  so  disconcerting  to  the  Englishmen,  the 
most  unexpected  feature  of  the  visitors'  play  was  the  surprising 
brilliancy  in-  the  direction  of  their  returns,  particularly  from 
close  to  the  net.  They  found  openings  for  killing  the  ball  that 
never  occurred  to  their  English  rivals,  and  even  the  imperturb- 
able   Doherty    brothers   were    amazed   at    the    combinations. 

Now  the  American  twist  service  has  been  much  heralded  as 
the  greatest  invention  or  development  of  recent  years  in  tennis, 
but  its  value  is  overestimated.  It  is  essentially  an  American 
stroke  and  has  a  distinct  value,  but  not  in  any  degree  what  it  is 
credited  with.  The  sheer  novelty  of  the  play  is  what  has  earned 
for  it  the  success  it  won.  Once  the  players  become  familiar  with 
the  peculiar  bound  of  the  ball,  they  will  not  find  so  much  diffi- 
culty in  handling  it.  But  its  purpose  was  not  originally  to  get 
the  twisting  bound  as  it  was  to  get  the  server  started  quicker 
in  his  haste  to  get  to  the  net.  Ward  is  really  the  inventor  of 
the  twist  service,  as  it  has  proven  the  most  successful. 

Ward  is  a  weak  ground-stroke  player,  and  he  was  generally 
beaten  if  he  could  be  kept  away  from  the  net,  so  it  was  neck  or 
nothing  with  him.  He  risked  everything  to  get  to  the  net  behind 
his  service  to  volley  the  first  return.  When  the  service  rule  was 
altered  in  1898  so  as  to  prevent  a  preliminary  run  before  the  ball 
was  delivered,  Ward  began  his  experiments  with  this  new  service, 
aad  he  soon  began  to  swing  the  racket  so  fast  around  his  head 
that  even  from  the  new  standing  position  required,  he  got  into 
motion  faster  than  most  other  servers  who  tried  to  volley  the  first 
return.  The  result  of  this  new  way  of  striking  the  ball  was  a 
twisting  delivery  curving  through  the  air  and  breaking  off  at  an 
angle  from  the  ground.  He  hit  upon  the  service  as  an  acci- 
dental discovery,  and  he  has  been  improving  it  ever  since.  There 
are  other  improvements  in  store  for  the  future,  however,  for  it 
is  not  beyond  the  range  of  possibility  that  this  twist  may  yet  be 
imparted  to  fast  return.  It  could  easily  be  introduced  into 
smashing  except  that  there  seems  to  be  little  gained  in  return  for 
the  additional  risk  of  missing  the  play.  A  smash  should  kill  the 
ball,  anyway,  with  or  without  a  twist,  and  a  ball  cannot  be 
"deader  than  dead,"  as  the  Irishman  once  expressed  it. 

All  through  the  metamorphosis  of  the  last  eventful  five  years 
of  the  game,  the  development  of  American  lawn  tennis  has  been 
consistently  in  the  line  of  attack.  The  execution  of  the  individual 
has  been  subordinated  to  the  system  of  attack.  Now  we  are 
beginning  to  learn  some  of  the  English  finish  of  execution  and 
American  skill  improves  yearly  in  consequence,  the  defence  grow-

ing  strong  with  each  season  in  consequence  of  the  steadiness  that 
this  improved  style  affords.  That  perfect  nef  attack  must  in  the 
end  beat  perfect  defence  requires  no  proof,  for  one  wins  and 
the  other  simply  does  not  lose.  Unless  English  leaders  adopt 
some  of  the  American  ideas  of  more  aggressive  attack  as  we 
have  been  adopting  theirs  in  stroke-play,  American  experts  must 
therefore   hold    the    international    advantage    before    many   years

SECRETS  OF  SUCCESS  AT  LAWN  TENNIS 


By  F.  W.  Payn. 
(Reprinted  from  English  Laivn  Tennis.) 

The  three  kindred  games  of  eye  and  hand â lawn  tennis,  golf 
and  billiards â have  the  one  great  feature  in  common  that  the 
man  who  is  able  to  retain  control  over  the  ball  for  the  longest 
time  after  he  has  struck  it  with  his  racket,  club  or  cue  is  gener- 
ally the  most  successful  player.  It  is  the  hardest  thing  to  do 
in  all  these  games,  but  in  proportion  as  a  player  masters  the 
art  of  it  he  can  put  the  ball  with  certainty  wherever  he  wants. 
One  of  the  best  examples  of  this  fact  is  provided  by  any  really 
good  billiard-marker.  If  he  be  carefully  watched  when  playing, 
it  will  be  seen  that  there,  is  hardly  any  preliminary  pulling  back 
of  his  cue  before  playing  the  stroke,  but  that  the  latter  consists 
almost  wholly  of  pushing  forward,  which  continues  long  after 
the  ball  is  struck  by  the  point  of  the  cue.  We  do  not  here  mean 
the  foul  slow-push  stroke  at  ill,  but  an  ordinary  stroke. 

The  fact  is  that  in  all  the  three  games  the  shorter  the  previous 
"swing-back"  (consistent  with  getting  enough  impetus)  of  the 
racket,  cue  or  club,  and  the  longer  the  follow-through,  the 
greater  will  be  the  accuracy  of  the  stroke.  A  good  billiard 
stroke,  as  we  have  said,  consists  almost  wholly  in  following 
through.  This  is,  of  course,  not  so  in  the  exceptional  case  of 
screwing  back  of  a  ball,  but  we  believe  that  it  is  the  secret  of 
success  in  playing  "winning  hazards."  James  Braid,  the  cham- 
pion golfer,  provides  a  conspicuous  instance  of  the  truth  of  our 
proposition  as  regards  golf.  His  iron  shots  are  probably  longer 
and  better  than  those  of  any  other  player,  yet  the  way  in  which 
he  plays  them  is  a  revelation  to  a  golfing  novice.  He  never  seems 
to  swing  his  iron  back  as  high  as  his  elbow,  and  he  puts  the 
whole  of  his  giant  strength  into  the  stroke  immediately  after  he 
has  struck  the  ball,  and  is  follozving  it  through. 

It  is  in  putting  the  "work"  on  at  this  part  of  the  stroke  that  his 
skill  lies.  We  have  seen  many  an  amateur  golfer  whose  strength 
and  style  of  play  in  every  other  way  were  worthless,  attain  to 
some  success  merely  because  he  had  grasped  the  importance  of 
the  follow-through.  Mr.  G.  Peacock,  who  is  well  known  in  the 
south  of  England  for  the  almost  ridiculous  accuracy  of  his  put- 
ting at  golf,  once  explained  to  us  that  the  secret  lies  in  drawing 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  183 

back  the  club  as  little  as  possible,  and  making  the  stroke  almost 
entirely  forward,  i.  e.,  following  through.  In  lawn  tennis,  real 
control  over  the  ball,  and,  above  all  things,  certainty  as  to  where 
it  is  going,  is  obtainable  in  no  other  way. 

It  is  generally  admitted  that  there  is  no  double  pair  alive 
as  good  as  the  Doherty  brothers.  If  anyone  cares  to  watch  R. 
Doherty's  method  of  underhand  low  volleying  at  the  net  (at 
which  he  chiefly  excels  in  the  double  game),  he  will  see  that 
there  is  practically  no  swing  back  at  all,  but  that  his  stroke  is  al- 
most wholly  a  "follow-through,"  as  in  the  case  of  the  billiard 
player  quoted  above.  Therein  lies  the  reason  why  he  puts  the  ball 
with  this  stroke  just  where  he  desires.  The  ordinary  player 
loses  time  with  his  swing-back,  and  attains  to  no  certainty  as  to 
the  spot  where  his  return  will  go.  The  Aliens  also  push  their 
volleys  at  the  net,  H.  Doherty's  drive  off  the  ground,  both  fore- 
hand and  backhand,  is  placed  probably  with  greater  accuracy 
than  that  of  anyone  else,  but  his  forehand  especially  is  followed 
right  through  with  his  racket,  after  he  has  struck  the  ball.  He 
thus  knows  exactly  where  he  is  going  to  place  it.  S.  H.  Smith 
does  the  same  on  his  forehand. 

But  the  best  example  of  them  all  at  lawn  tennis  is  that  of 
E.  R.  Allen.  The  natural  eccentricities  of  his  figure  prevent  him 
from  doing  much  volleying  overhead  against  good  players,  and 
cause  him  to  rely  almost  wholly  on  the  placing  of  his  drives  off 
the  ground.  He  places  his  returns  of  the  ball  in  the  same  style, 
and  with  as  perfect  accuracy,  as  if  he  were  shoveling  coals  off 
the  ground  into  a  cart.  That  is  to  say,  he  retains  control  with 
his  racket  as  one  would  with  a  shovel  to  the  very  last  moment. 
W.  V.  Eaves,  who  has  been  a  conspicuously  successful  player, 
relies  largely  on  his  backhand  stroke,  which  he  practically  places 
wherever  he  wants.  This  stroke,  which  is  one  of  the  prettiest 
that  we  have  seen,  has  no  swing-back  about  it  to  speak  of.  but 
it  is  followed  through  with  the  wrist  to  the  very  end  of  the 
swing  forward ;  hence  the  player  steers  the  ball  into  all  sorts  of 
unlikely  corners  at  his  pleasure.  H.  S.  Mahony's  strongest  point 
is  probably  his  backhand.  He  does  not  appear  to  swing  back  at 
all,  but  he  finishes  the  stroke  right  out  at  arm's  length,  which 
is  the  case  with  very  few  people. 

So  much  for  following-through  at  lawn  tennis.  It  would  be 
idle  to  say  that  it  is  easy,  or  that  it  usually  "comes  naturally" 
to  player.  If  it  did  we  should  see  a  great  deal  more  of  it  than 
we  do  at  present.  There  is  a  great  difference  between  the  hap- 
hazard tap  or  blow  which  most  players  give  the  ball  (with  but 
a  hazy  idea  where  it  is  going)  and  the  firm  follow-through  of 
players    who   know    already   the   place   where    their    return    will

pitch.  The  only  way  to  learn  the  "dodge"  is  to  watch  good 
players,  and  to  think  of  it  every  time  one  plays  a  stroke  until  one 
can  do  it  with  facility. 

Anyone  with  a  practiced  eye  who  watches  a  lawn  tennis  player 
can  tell  at  a  glance  if  he  has  mastered  one  of  the  great  secrets 
of  the  game,  in  learning  to  play  every  stroke  from  his  shoulder 
and  not  from  his  elbow.  The  difference  between  a  shoulder 
stroke  and  an  elbow  stroke  (both  on  forehand  and  backhand) 
is  immense  and  apparent,  because  in  the  one  case  the  player  puts 
into  the  stroke  the  momentum  of  his  whole  body,  whereas  in 
the  other  case  he  only  puts  into  it  that  of  half  a  limb.  Many 
people  have  been  astonished  at  the  ease  with  which  two  of  the 
players,  who,  par  excellence,  know  how  to  hit  from  the  shoulder 
(viz.,  S.  H.  Smith  and  R.  F.  Doherty),  can  go  on  playing  all 
day,  but  the  fact  is  that  when  a  man  hns  learned  by  swinging 
his  shoulder  to  get  the  whole  weight  of  his  body  with  his 
drive,  this  stroke  takes  no  more  out  of  him  than  the  other,  and 
is  infinitely  more  effective. 

In  order  to  make  the  matter  clear  it  is  necessary  to  say  some- 
thing about  the  mechanical  theory  of  a  lawn  tennis  stroke,  with 
the  aid  of  the  accompanying  diagram: 


B_ 


pfe 


Â«  D 

(The  o  at  E  is  a  tennis  ball.) 

A  B  represents  the  player's  shoulder  at  which  the  force  P  is 
applied,  his  elbow  is  at  the  point  C,  his  wrist  at  the  point  D,  and 
his  racket  at  the  point  E.  All  the  lines  from  B  to  E  constitute 
a  lever,  of  which  the  fulcrum  is  at  E,  and  the  power  at  B._  Now, 
in  the  case  of  a  first-class  player,  the  two  halves  of  his  arm. 
B  C  and  C  D,  are  used,  as  nothing  but  connecting-rods,  loosely 
jointed  together  at  the  elbow  C,  for  transmitting  the  force  ap- 
plied at  B  to  D. 

It  is  a  very  common  thing  to  find  people  who  play  their  fore- 
hand drive  unconsciously,  in  entire  accordance  with  this  theory, 
but  it  is,  or  was,  most  unusual  to  find  a  player  who  used  his  shoul- 
der for  both  backhand  and  forehand  strokes.  There  is  an  im- 
mensely stroRg  tendency  to  put  power  into  the  stroke  from  the 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  185 

elbow  on  the  backhand,  and  this  Is  fatal  to  a  free  hit  from  the 
shoulder.  The  power  of  playing  a  backhand  drive,  keeping  the 
elbow  joint  in  an  entirely  loose  and  flexible  condition,  and  doing 
all  the  work  with  the  shoulder,  is  the  thing  which  especially 
marks  the  superiority  of  such  players  as  W.  V.  Eaves  and  H.  L. 
Doherty.  H.  S.  Mahony's  backhand,  in  this  respect,  is  excellent, 
and  in  marked  contrast  to  his  forehand. 

The  part  played  by  the  wrist  at  point  D  is  noteworthy.  When 
the  force  is  properly  applied  at  B,  the  wrist  serves  mainly  for 
steering  purposes,  but  when  the  stroke  is  made  from  the  elbow 
without  swinging  the  shoulder,  the  wrist  often  imparts  some 
extra  force  into  the  stroke  in  order  to  amend  it.  One  of  the 
reasons  why  golf  is  such  bad  practice  for  lawn  tennis,  lies  in 
the  fact  that  the  "approach  shot"  in  that  game  requires  the  use 
of  force  from  the  elbow,  which  is  of  course  stiffened  at  the 
same  time ;  whereas  in  lawn  tennis  the  work  should  be  done  by 
the  shoulder,  and  the  elbow  should  be  kept  loose. 

I  am  greatly  indebted  to  that  excellent  teacher  of  lawn  tennis, 
Burke,  for  clear  instruction  on  this  point,  which  I  have  never 
obtained  from  anybody  else,  although,  doubtless,  the  subject 
matter  of  this  article  is  well  known  already  to  many  players. 
The  "follow-through"  and  the  use  of  the  shoulder  appear  to  me 
to  be  the  cardinal  features  of  lawn  tennis.  If  I  were  asked  to 
mention  the  things  which  rank  next  to  them  in  importance,  1 
should  say  that  they  consisted,  firstly,  in  keeping  one's  eye 
wholly  on  the  ball,  and  on  nothing  else,  as  it  bounds  and  as  one 
strikes  it ;  and,  secondly,  in  using  the  greatest  possible  speed  in 
striking  a  ball  after  it  has  bounced.  Many  players  watch  their 
opponents,  and  not  the  ball,  as  they  are  making  a  stroke. 

I  have  stated  above  that  the  Nice  professional,  Burke,  was  the 
only  person  who  ever  explained  the  shoulder  business  to  me. 
The  amateur  cracks  on  the  whole  recall  a  certain  verse  in 
Shakespeare  to  the  effect  that 

"The  secrets  of  Nature 
Have   not   more   gift   in   taciturnity." 

In  other  words,  they  are  content  to  go  on  with  the  merry  game 
of  knocking  out  crocks,  but  if  the  latter  want  to  learn  anything 
from  them  it  must  usually  be  (as  at  poker)  by  "observation" 
alone.  A  well-known  player  from  across  St.  George's  Channel 
must  be  wholly  excepted  from  this  criticism ;  but  unluckily  opin- 
ions are  somewhat  divided  as  to  the  merits  of  his  well-meant 
advice  and  theories.  It  is  quite  possible  that  this  "closeness" 
on  the  part  of  the  cracks  may  account  to  some  extent  for  the 
small  number  of  new  rising  players  at  present  in  lawn  tennis. 
There  is  also  undoubtedly  a  great  deal  of  absolutely  flat  igno- 


i86  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

ranee  as  to  what  sort  of  game  a  single  between  two  good  players 
really  is.  Lawn  tennis  is  unfortunately  associated  in  the  minds 
of  many  people  with  mixed  doubles  in  public  gardens. 

NOTES   ON    THE    FOREHAND    DRIVE 

The  forehand  drive  is  the  most  essential  thing  in  lawn  tennis. 
If  proof  were  needed  of  this,  it  might  be  found  in  the  fact  that 
the  present  champion  relied  chiefly  on  his  splendid  drive  for  his 
success,  and  hardly  volle3^ed  at  all.  There  is,  however,  an  even 
better  illustration  to  hand.  Mr.  Gore  has  an  excellent  backhand 
drive,  whereas  Mr.  S.  H.  Smith,  who  was  in  the  final  of  the 
all-comers'  singles  in  1899,  and  who  reached  the  challenge  round 
the  following  year,  won  nearly  all  his  strokes  from  his  forehand 
drive  off  the  ground.  Neither  of  these  players  is  accustomed  to 
win  many  aces  cither  by  his  service  or  Ijy  volleying.  It  is  their 
drive  alone  which  "does  the  trick."  If  any  further  proof  is 
needed,  it  is  merely  necessary  to  point  to  Mr.  Smith's  very  num- 
erous successes  in  various  other  parts  of  the  country.  People 
who  have  watched  this  player's  game  on  good  dry  courts  at 
the  end  of  the  season  at  Brighton  and  Eastbourne  of  late  years, 
when  his  drive  has  often  developed  into  something  terrific,  must 
have  seen,  firstly,  that  his  stroke  was  unlike  that  of  anyone  else, 
and,  secondly,  that  it  was  so  effective  that  hardly  anybody  could 
stand  up  against  it  unless  he  could  call  in  the  aid  of  craft. 

Mr.  H.  S.  Barlow  was  a  peculiar  adept  in  the  craft  which 
consists  in  defeating  hard  hitting  by  short  cross  volleys,  screws, 
and  soft  "drop"  shots,  because  it  is  impossible  for  the  driver  to 
"slog"  these  strokes.  This,  however,  is  by  the  way.  As  the 
results  of  this  style  of  driving  have  been  so  conspicuous  in 
English  lawn  tennis  of  late  years,  and  as  the  scalps  of  every 
single  first-class  player,  with  but  one  exception,  have  dangled 
from  the  girdle  of  the  player  who  has  been  the  master  and  ex- 
ponent of  it  during  the  last  three  years,  it  is  clearly  worth 
while  to  try  to  explain  how  it  is  done.  There  are  three  essential 
things  about  this  drive,  vv-hich  are  all  equally  important.  The 
first  relates  to  what  may  be  called  (by  misusing  a  golfing  term) 
the  s'tCDicc.  Terrific  slogs  of  the  kind  mentioned  above  are  only 
obtained  by  planting  the  right  foot  (for  right-handed  players) 
very  firmly  in  advance  just  before  striking  the  ball.  By  this 
means  alone  the  player  can  get  a  "shove  off"  with  the  whole 
weight  of  the  body.  This  is  the  secret  by  which  a  forehand 
drive  can  be  made  which  is  nearly  twice  as  hard  as  one  made  in 
any  other  way. 

The  strange  thing  about  the  matter  is  that,  although  one 
player  makes  use  of  it.  this  plant  is  not  only  far  more  effective 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  187 

but  it  is  also  less  fatiguing  than  any  other  The  stroke  is  played 
from  a  firm  and  comfortable  position,  and  with  ^  great  mechan 
ical  advantage.  It  is,  however,  impossible  to  play  it  with  any 
success  unlets  particular  attention  is  paid  to  the  two  other  re- 
quisites, viz.,  the  active  swing  of  the  shoulder  and  the  Uming 
of  the  stroke.  As  regards  the  first  point,  it  is  impossible  as  1 
have  previouslv  observed,  to  throw  the  weight  of  the  body  into 
the  stroke  except  by  working  the  shoulder.  Every  drive  shoo^c 
be  played  from  the  shoulder.  Any  one  who  takes  the  trouble 
to  play  this  stroke  as  I  have  described  it  will  soon  find  out 
the  importance  of  this  part  of  it.  Lastly  unti  a  player  has 
grasped  the  absolute  necessity  of  strikmg  the  ball  at  the  top  ot 
its  flight  immediately  after  it  has  bounced,  he  will  never  make 
anything  of  this  particular  kind  of  "Smith     drive. 

The  fact  is  that  very  few  players  outside  of  the  first-class  have 
any  idea  as  to  the  meaning  of  speed  in  driving  a  ball  on  the 
bounce.  If  anyone  has  the  curiosity  to  consider  this  I  advise 
him  to  watch  the  time  of  flight  at  which  Messrs.  H  L.  Doherty, 
Smith,  and  Greville  drive  the  ball  compared  to  that  of  the  ordi- 
nary player.  In  fact,  the  speed  in  striking  is  often  the  essence 
of  the  whole  matter.  I  might,  of  course,  remark  that  unless  the 
wrist  and  the  elbow  are  kept  rigidly  under  control,  and  subordi- 
nate to  the  shoulder,  when  the  stroke  is  played,  not  only  is  there 
no  possibility  of  accuracy,  but  the  ball  will  probably  land  m  the 

"^So  much  for  the  "Smith"  drive.  There  is  nothing  which  the 
ordinary  run  of  people  outside  the  lawn  tennis  world  understand 
less  than  that  anyone  should  take  the  subject  of  lawn  tennis 
seriously.  In  their  minds  it  is  merely  a  pastime,  and  they  think 
that  one  might  just  as  well  write  a  treatise  on  the  theory  of 
shove-halfpenny  and  ping  pong.  But  to  play  a  hard  five-set 
match  in  a  single  is  no  more  like  playing  pmg  pons  than  to  play 
a  cup  tie  at  "Rugger"  or  to  box  six  rounds  m  a  knock-out 
competition.  There  is  a  sort  of  anti-sport  crusade  in  many  of  the 
newspapers,  carried  on  by  well-meaning  persons  who  want  the 
English  to  abandon  their  field  sports,  and  to  become  like  the 
clerkish  young  men  of  the  Continent.  The  best  argument  against 
this  sort  of  person  is  the  African  war.  If  the  English  officers 
and  soldiers  alike  had  not  been  "brought  up  on  a  long  course 
of  cricket,  football,  boxing,  etc.,  which  are  something  very  dif- 
ferent from  mere  "pastimes,"  there  would  not -now  be  much 
chance  for  the  commercial  pursuits  in  the  Transvaal  which  so 
many  of  these  well-meaning  people  will  be  able  to  carry  on  sole- 
ly through  the  labors  of  the  soldiery.

NOTES    ON    THE    OFFENSIVE    GAME 

It  is  necessary  to  explain  at  the  start  that  the  prime  object  of 
this  article  is  merely  to  deal  with  attack  as  opposed  to  defence, 
and  not  to  treat  of  those  "offensive"  methods  so  familiar  to 
many  of  us,  which  may  be  included  under  the  description  of 
"bustling  the  umpire,"  and  "putting  a  man  off."  Probably  the 
best  known  of  this  kind  of  maneuver  consists  in  pottering  about 
between  games  and  strokes,  and  in  assuming  a  state  of  fortunate 
"unreadiness"  when  a  really  warm  "service"  comes  over. 
Apropos  of  the  former  I  recall  an  amusing  incident  which  oc- 
curred some  years  back.  In  the  days  when  one  of  the  famous 
twins  was  nearer  nineteen  inches  round  the  waist  than  he  is  at 
present  he  was  once  playing  a  man  who  deliberately  had  re- 
course to  a  drink,  a  towel  and  some  sawdust  at  the  end  of  every 
game.  At  last,  at  about  the  twentieth  game  the  twin's  patience 
gave  way,  and  with  a  knowing  wink  he  shouted  to  a  bystander, 
"The  same  old  dodge,  you  see !"  After  that  there  were  no  more 
delays.  The  "unready  maneuver"  recalls  to  the  writer  the  plan 
of  a  gunmaker  who  explained  that  when  shooting  pigeons  against 
crack  Americans,  if  he  saw  a  very  fast  bird,  he  always  held 
his  fire,  and  abused  the  boy  instead  for  pulling  the  string  too 
soon. 

To  return  to  the  subject  of  the  attacking  game,  I  may  say  at 
the  outset  that,  with  some  apparent,  but  not  real,  exceptions,  I 
believe  the  maxim  of  Napoleon,  that  "the  army  which  stays  in 
its  entrenchments  gets  beaten,"  is  as  true  in  lawn  tennis  as  in 
soldiering.  In  other  words,  in  order  to  defeat  a  man  who  knows 
the  game  it  is  necessary  to  constantly  strive  to  "force  an  open- 
ing," as  it  is  called,  by  means  of  some  stroke  which  is  either 
sufficiently  well  placed  or  sufficiently  hard  to  be  followed  up  to 
the  net  witlj  a  reasonable  chance  of  success.  In  every  match 
the  man  who  forces  the  game  most  by  running  up  to  the  net 
will  always  win,  unless  (i)  there  is  a  very  great  disparity  be- 
tween the  back  play  of  the  two  players,  or  (2)  the  player  who 
goes  up  to  the  net  does  not  know  how  to  volley  properly  when 
he  gets  there. 

It  will  of  course  be  immediately  urged  that  there  are  many 
first-class  players,  such  as  Messrs.  Gore,  Smith,  and  Boucher, 
who  win  their  matches  from  the  back  line.  But  they  do  so 
chiefly  because  in  lawn  tennis  before  one  can  play  the  attackipg 
game  at  the  net  with  success  it  is  necessary  to  have  at  least 
some  sort  of  defensive  ability  in  hitting  from  the  back  of  the 
court  when  driven  into  that  position.  Hence  the  game  of  the 
volleyers  crumbles  to  pieces  against  that  of  a  steady  base-line 
player,  unless  he  is  able  when  the  need  arises  to  play  a  defensive 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  189 

game  from  that  position.  But  the  number  of  voUeyers  who  can 
do  this  is  extremely  select.  The  Messrs.  Doherty  for  a  long 
time  relied  chiefly  on  their  splendid  back  game,  and  only  devel- 
oped their  volleying  powers  much  later.  Mr.  H.  S.  Mahony, 
although  a  fine  volleyer,  is  very  often  defective  on  his  forehand. 
Mr.  G.  W.  Hillyard's  driving  from  the  back  line  is  probably  as 
good  as  anybody's,  and  he  is  deadly  "overhead,"  but  his  low 
volleying  is  not  so  good.  Mr.  S.  H.  Smith  is  chiefly  a  base-line 
player  of  unique  severity.  Mr.  Roper  Barrett  undoubtedly  dis- 
plays command  of  both  styles  of  play,  though  his  service  is  weak. 
It  is  a  great  pity  that  he  never  favors  the  Eastbourne  spectators 
with  a  sight  of  his  powers  against  the  best  cracks.  Mr.  M.  J.  G. 
Ritchie  volleys  considerably  more  than  was  his  wont,  but  tends 
to  returns  to  base-line  play  in  a  hard  match.  Mr.  A.  W.  Gore 
had  so  steady  a  hand  and  so  correct  a  swing  in  driving  that  he 
made  up  to  a  considerable  extent  for  his  lack  of  volleying  by 
passing  with  great  regularity  anyone  who  came  up  on  anything 
but  a  very  good  stroke.  Mr.  C.  P.  Dixon  was  good  at  both 
kinds  of  game,  and  the  same  may  be  said  of  Mr.  G.  M.  Simond 
to  a  lesser  extent.  Mr.  C.  R.  D.  Pritchett  appears  to  the  Avriter 
to  be  likely  to  come  to  the  front  through  his  marked  activity  at 
the  net,  and  his  clean  hitting  from  the  back  of  the  court.  Mr. 
F.  L.  Riseley  is  a  fine  volleyer,  with  an  excellent  drive  as  well. 
Dr.  J.  Pim  is,  of  course,  the  classic  example  of  the  main  theme 
of  this  article,  but  I  am  bound  to  say  that  when  opposed  to  Mr. 
Smith  at  the  South  Coast  meeting  last  year,  at  which  he  re- 
vived his  reputation,  he  was  unable  to  play  anything  but  a  de- 
fensive game  against  that  player. 

It  is  needless  to  say  that  the  attacking  game  when  properly 
carried  out  makes  the  game  infinitely  quicker  and  more  exciting, 
both  to  play  and  to  watch,  than  when  it  is  played  from,  the  base 
line.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  chief  feature  in  the  attacking 
game  consists  in  running  in  constantly  on  services  which  are  (i) 
sufficiently  hard  and  (2)  well  placed.  I  do  not  think  that  it 
will  be  denied  by  the  bulk  of  the  many  players  who  have  played 
matches  against  me  in  the  last  few  years,  apart  from  their 
experiences  against  other  players,  that  this  maneuver  is  capable 
of  being  used  with  great  advantage  against  all  classes  of  players. 

In  my  opinion  the  secret  alike  of  pace  and  placing  in  the 
service  consists  primarily  in  directing  one's  consciousness  to  the 
shoulder  socket.  The  freedom  with  which  one  swings  the  arm 
from  this  point  determines  the  pace  of  the  service.  This  shoul- 
der swing  (which  I  can  only  describe  by  saying  that  it  is  a 
swing  from  the  very  top  of  the  shoulder)  is  essential  (i)  to 
place  the  service  with   freedom   from   side  to   side  of  the  court 


190  SPALDING  S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

at  pleasure.  This  power  is  absolutely  necessary  in  order  to  make 
a  success  of  "running-in"  on  the  service.  For  when  one's  oppo- 
nent takes  up  his  stand  to  cover  one  side  of  the  court,  then  is  the 
time  to  bring  the  service  into  the  other  corner,  if  one  can  do  it. 
(2)  This  swing  is  also  essential  in  order  to  conceal  from  the 
opponent  the  direction  which  the  service  will  take.  When  the 
arm  is  serving  freely  from  the  shoulder- joint,  it  is  most  difficult 
to  tell  where  the  serve  will  pitch,  provided  the  server  can  vary 
the  placing  of  it.  Most  players  serve  monotonously  into  one 
place,  or  else,  when  they  do  vary  the  place,  the  stroke  loses  pace. 
It  is  most  necessary  to  select  the  exact  spot  where  the  serve 
should  pitch,  and  to  aim  for  it.  In  attempting  to  "run  in"  on  the 
service  speed  is  nearly  everything,  and  the  closer  one  can  get  to 
the  net  after  the  delivery,  the  greater  by  many  degrees  will  be 
the  chances  of  killing  the  ball  on  the  volley.  This  point  is 
three-quarters  of  the  battle.  It  is,  of  course,  highly  necessary  to 
guard  against  foot  faults.  When  the  server  gets  really  close  up 
to  the  net  after  his  serve  and  manages  to  reach  the  return  at 
all,  it  is,  in  my  opinion,  about  five  to  one  that  he  will  win  the 
stroke.  Mr.  F.  L.  Riseley's  service  appears  to  me  to  be  about 
as  free  and  hard  as  can  be  seen. 

It  is  worth  while  strongly  to  call  attention  to  the  fact  that 
the  thumb  can  be  made  use  of  to  great  advantage  in  suddenly 
altering  the  direction  of  a  service.  The  majority  of  players  neg- 
lect the  use  of  the  thumb  altogether  for  this  purpose.  The  player, 
for  example,  is  about  to  serve  into  the  left  court,  and  perceives 
that  his  adversary  is  guarding  the  middle  line ;  a  slight  working 
of  the  thumb,  which  is  pressed  flat  along  the  racket  for  the 
purpose,  will  suffice  to  discharge  the  ball  along  the  outside  line 
out  of  reach.  This  can  be  done  even  better  if  the  server  sta- 
tions himself  a  couple  of  yards  to  the  left  of  the  middle  of  the 
base-line,  in  which  case  the  ball  comes  over  at  a  much  more 
awkward  angle.

THE  COURT. 

I.  The  Court  is  78  feet  long  and  27  feet  wide.  It  is  divided 
across  the  middle  by  a  net,  the  ends  of  which  are  attached  to 
two  posts,   A   and   B,   standing  3   feet  outside  of  the   Court  on

either  side.  The  height  of  the  net  is  3  feet  6  inches  at  the 
posts  and  3  feet  in  the  middle.  At  each  end  of  the  Court,  parallel 
with  the  net,  and  39  feet  from  it,  are  drawn  the  base  lines  D  E 
and  F  G,  the  ends  of  which  are  connected  by  the  side  lines  D  F 
and  E  G.  Half  way  between  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  is  drawn  the  half  Court  line  I  H,  dividing  the  space  on 
each  side  of  the  net  into  two  equal  parts,  the  right  and  left 
Courts.  On  each  side  of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21  feet  from 
it,  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and  M  N. 

THE  BALLS. 

2.  The  ball  shall  measure  not  less  than  2^  inches,  nor  more 
than  2  9-16  inches  in  diameter ;  and  shall  weigh  not  less  than 
I  15-16  ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 

THE  GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first 
game,  shall  be  decided  by  toss;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of 


tpi  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

the  toss  choose  the  right  to  serve  the  other  player  shall  have 
choice  of  sides,  and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may 
insist  upon  a  choice  by  his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the 
Court  the  other  may  elect  not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net;  the 
player  who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and 
the  other  the  striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become 
server,  and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out;  and  so  on  alter- 
nately in  all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set,  and  following  sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  serve  with  both  feet  behind,  i.e.,  further 
from  the  net  than  the  base  line,  and  within  the  limits  of  the 
imaginary  continuation  of  the  center  service  and  the  side  lines. 
It  is  not  a  fault  if  one  only  of  the  server's  feet  do  not  touch 
the  ground  at  the  moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He 
shall  place  both  feet  upon  the  ground  immediately  before  serving, 
and  shall  not  take  a  running  nor  a  walking  start.  He  shall 
deliver  the  service  from  the  right  and  left  courts  alternately,  be- 
ginning from  the  right,  in  each  of  his  service  games,  even  though 
odds  be  given  or  owed. 

7.  The  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line,  half- 
court  line,  and  side  line  of  the  Court,  diagonally  opposite  to 
that  from  which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  drop  in  the  net  beyond  the 
service  line,  or  out  of  court,  or  in  the  wrong  court ;  or  if  the 
server  do  not  stand  as  directed  by  law  6.  If  the  server,  in  at- 
tempting to  serve,  miss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does  not  count  a 
fault,  but  if  the  ball  be  touched,  no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the 
racket,  a  service  is  thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing  the 
service  at  once  apply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same 
Court  from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault 
because  he  served  from  the  wrong  Court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after  the  next  service  is  deliv- 
ered. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  I93 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  till  the  striker-out  is  ready. 
If  the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service  he  shall  be  deemed 
ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not 
ready  counts  for  nothing. 

14.  The  service  shall  not  be  volleyed â that  is,  taken  before  it 
has  touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as 
provided  for  in  law  8,  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  de- 
cided. 

i6.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net ;  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for 
nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  serv- 
ice, or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play ;  or  if 
he  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside 
of  his  opponent's  court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  pro- 
vided by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  con- 
secutive faults ;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play ;  or  if  he 
return  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's 
Court,  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  Court 
bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  any- 
thing thai  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of 
striking ;  or  if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once ; 
or  if  he  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in 
play ;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident  not  within 
his  control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  where  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  Court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the 
point  shall  be  counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around 
the  Court  shall  be  considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however, 
a  ball  in  play  strike  a  permanent  fixture  of  the  Court  (other  than 
the  net  or  posts)  before  it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ; 
if  after  it  has  touched  the  ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 


194  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TEXNIS   ANNUAL. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is 
called  15  for  that  player;  on  either  player  winning  his  second 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  30  for  that  player,  on  either  player 
winning  his  third  stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player ; 
and  the  fourth  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for 
that  player,  except  as  below :  If  both  players  have  won  three 
strokes  the  score  is  called  deuce,  and  the  next  stroke  won  by  either 
player  is  scored  advantage  for  that  player.  If  the  same  player 
win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game ;  if  he  lose  the  next  stroke, 
the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until  one  player  wins  the 
two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of  deuce,  when  game 
is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set ;  except 
as  below :  If  both  players  win  five  games,  the  score  is  called 
games  all;  and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored 
advantage  game  for  that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the 
next  game  he  wins  the  set;  if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score 
returns  to  games  all ;  and  so  on  until  either  player  wins  the 
two  games  immediately  following  the  score  of  games  all,  when  he 
wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having  charge  of  any  tournament 
may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule  by  the  omission  of  advan- 
tage sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set,  and  at  the  end 
of  each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even. 
It  shall,  however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and 
notification  to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game 
of  the  match,  to  change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set,  until 
the  odd  and  concluding  set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at 
the  end  of  the  first,  third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game 
of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded;   provided,  however,  that  at 

*An  exception  to  this  rule  was  made  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the 
U.S.N.L.T.A.,  in  1902,  when  it  was  olticially  decided  that  "all  matches  in 
which  ladies  take  part  in  tournaments  given  under  the  auspices  of  the 
U.S.N.L.T.A.  shall  be  the  best  two  in  three  sets,  with  a  rest  not  exceeding 
seven   minutes  at   the   end   of   the   second  set." 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  195 

the  end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which 
shall  not  exceed  seven  minutes ;  and  provided,  further,  that  in 
case  of  an  unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the 
contestants,  a  cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  min- 
utes may  be  allowed  between  points ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be 
strictly  construed,  and  the  privilege  never  granted  for  the  pur- 
pose of  allowing  a  player  to  recover  his  strength  or  wind.  The 
referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time  postpone  the  match  on 
account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground  or  weather.  In 
any  case  of  postponement  the  previous  score  shall  hold  good. 
When  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour  the  player,  who 
at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  Court  first  chosen,  shall  have 
the  choice  of  Courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He 
shall  stay  in  the  Court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set. 
The  last  two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  when  the 
players  change  every  alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn  the  umpire,  as  soon  as 
the  mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who 
ought  to  have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discov- 
ery shall  be  counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  be- 
fore such  discovery,  then  the  service  in  the  next  alternate  game 
shall  be  delivered  by  the  player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his 
turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  below : 

THE    THREE-HANDED    AND    FOUR-HANDED    GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  Court 
shall  be  36  feet  in  width ;  4^  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and 
parallel  with  them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and 
L  N.  The  service  lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which 
they  meet  the  service  side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game  the  single  player  shall  serve  in 
every  alternate  game., 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to 
serve  in  the  first  game   shall  decide  which  partner  shall   do  so; 


196 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


and  the  opposing  pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second 
game.  1'he  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  first  game 
shall  serve  in  the  third,  and  the  partner  of  the  player  who  served 
in  the  second  game  shall  serVe  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order 
shall  be  maintained  in  all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

31.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set  either  partner  of  the  pair 
which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve,  and 
the  same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  the  second  game 
of  the  new  set. 

S2.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout 
the  game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  part- 
ner;  and  the.  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established 
shall  not  be  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  Courts  to 
receive  the  service  till  the  end  of  the  set. 

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  between  the 
service  line,  half-court  line  and  service  side  line  of  the  Court, 
diagonally  opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  as  provided  in 
law  33.  or  if  il  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he  wears 
or  carries.

Drcisioii.- â The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
|)resumably  good  imtil  it  strikes  in  the  wrt)ng  court.  A  player 
caiuiot  lake  the  decision  upou  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If  it 
is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  oidy  to  gel  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready. 
Me  tries  to  retmii  it  and  fails.  Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played 
over  again? 

Prcisiou. â  No.  If  \\c  attempts  to  retmii  the  service  he  is 
deemed  ready. 

IV.  The  striker-out  calls  "Not  ready,"  for  a  second  service. 
The  ball  sliikes  beyinid  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out 
claims  that  the  fact  that  he  was  not  ready  makes  no  difference, 
since  a  faull  c.imiol  be  retmiied.  and,  iheiefore,  that  two  faults 
have  been  seived. 

Decision. â  The  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  |>laycr 
cannot  call  "Not  ready,"  and  then  have  the  service  coimt,  or 
not.  as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  boiuids  back  into 
the  court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net 
and  plays  it  before  it  falls.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  so? 


198  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

Decision. â Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has  a 
right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses  the 
net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the 
net.     Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. â It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touched  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket, 
provided  that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. â Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not  volley 
the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall  not  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into 
the  net.     Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. â Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  matter 
if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  lea/es  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and 
returns  it  over  the  net.    Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. â Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in  a 
player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unquestion- 
ably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the  ground 
by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside 
posts.  A  player  touches  the  net  beyond  the  inside  posts,  and 
claims  that  he  does  not  lose  the  stroke  because  there  should  be 
no  net  more  than  three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. â He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have  ob- 
jected to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.  Is  it  a  good  re- 
turn? 

Decision. â Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stdnd  on  op- 
posite sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading  his 
opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  I99 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in 
court.    Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision. â Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  post  of  the 
net  and  bounds  into  the  opposite  court. 

Decision. â It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  The  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in 
the  court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision. â Yes,  if  it  be  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball  is 
returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the 
court.    Is  this  necessary? 

Decision. â No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to 
return  the  ball.    May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. â Yes,  if,  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes  or 
the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player  is 
interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played  again, 
because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrangements  of 
the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front  of  those 
seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  thef  original  line,  and  so  inter- 
feres with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played  again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  Umpire 
directs  the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  The  server  had  previously 
served  a  fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. â The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the 
player  claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. â Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court. 
His  opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. â It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right  court 
under  all  circumstances. 

XX.  At    fifteen-all    the    server    by    mistake    serves    from    the 


200  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

left  court,  he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the 
mistake  is  then  discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  stroke? 
From  which  court  should  he  serve  next? 

Decision.-;â The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being  thirty- 
fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the 
stroke,  and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. â If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  is 
simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  Umpire  directs  the 
players  to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been 
won,  when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be 
played.    What  is  to  be  done? 

Decision. â The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no  part 
of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the  matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  can- 
not hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that 
the  umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither 
case  can  the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it, 
only  to  find  that  the  Umpire  has  called  "play."  Has  he  any  re- 
dress? 

Decision. â No. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes 
and  says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he 
claims  he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  um- 
pire cannot  change  his  decision. 

Decision. â The  umpire  should  call  a^^let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the 
umpire  calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and 
lets  the  ball  fall.    He  then  claims  to  have  the  stroke  played  again. 

Decision.â The  stroke  stands. 

XXVI.  The  ball  strikes  the  ground  close  to  a  line  the  scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal  to  the  linesman. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  ^Ol 

the  latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision 
stands? 

Decision. â The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out  until 
the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  decision 
of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  â¢  a  linesman 
affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom 
of  the  net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. â Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the 
ball  in  play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.  May  a  let  be 
claimed? 

Decision. â Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he 
lose  the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault? 

Decision. â A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that 
it  is  his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

Decision. â Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not 
appear  in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to 
play  single-handed  against  the  opposing  pair.  May  he  do  so? 

Decision. â No. 


UNOFFICIAL   DECISIONS   ON   DOUBTFUL   POINTS. 
(From   Lazvn    Tennis.) 

Both  of  the  opponents  of  the  servers  in  doubles  are  strikers- 
out  alternately  during  a  game.  It  is  optional  with  them  which 
shall  serve  first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  throughout  each 
set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that 
ultimately  falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch 
it  in  doing  so. 

If  one  partner  of  a  doubles  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does 
not  touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.     A  player, 


202  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

or  different  member  of  a  team,  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as 
they  please ;    it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the 
proper  court ;    a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits 
of  the  side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be 
made  on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  tlie  same 
court  until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the 
second  service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims 
to  be  not  ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second 
service,  the  server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service 
was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck 
the  net.  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the 
point  has  been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net, 
and  nothing  which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point. 
If  the  ball  knocks  the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same 
decision  holds  good ;  it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  de- 
cide which  touches  the  net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the 
same  sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the 
set  begins.  The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the 
right  court;  he  may  select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the 
set,  but   must   hold  this   to  the   end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net 
after  having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  'The 
point  counts  in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to 
return  it.  The  latter  may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball, 
but  loses  the  point  if  he  touches  the  net  in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside 
of  the  net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if 
the  ball  falls  in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  out- 
side of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice. 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  203 

The  player  loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  cloth- 
ing while  still  in  play,  no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside 
of  the  court  when  the  ball  hits  him,  or  not.. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes 
any  support  of  the  netâ the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre 
forkâ a  part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  these 
supports  and  still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good 
return  (except  on  the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand 
outside  of  the  court,  and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp 
angle  from  outside  might  well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of 
the  pests. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the 
other  side,  no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the 
ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  any  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  Winning  by  default 
before  defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  docs  not  disqualify  a 
player  from  the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right 
and  left  courts;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong 
court  it  is  a  fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in 
the  matter ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

but  shall  be  entitled  to  delegate  their  power  to  a  Committee.  In 
case  no  special  Committee  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Officers  of 
the  Club  holding  the  Tournament,  the  powers  and  functions  here-

the  cup  until  one  month  previous  to  the  next  competition  for  the 
cup,  possession  being  conditional  on  the  giving  of  a  bond  by  the 
winner  satisfactory  to  the  Club.  Should  the  Club  give  posses-

point  a  substitute  to  be  approved  by  them.  The  Referee  or 
his  duly  appointed  substitute  must  be  present  at  all  times  when 
play  is  in  progress. 

6â The  Referee  or  such  other  member  or  members  of  the

which  an  Umpire  may  profess  himself  unable  to  decide,  or  which 
may  be  referred  to  him  on  appeal  from  the  decision  of  an  Umpire, 
and  such  decision  shall  be  final. 

7.â The  Referee  shall,  during  the  Tournament,  be  ex-officio  a 
member   of   the   Committee. 

8.â The  Committee  shall  help  to  keep  order  on  the  ground, 
and  shall  consult  and  decide  upon  any  question  arising  out  of 
the  competition,  if  summoned  for  that  purpose  by  the  Referee 
or  by  any  two  of  their  number ;  and  they  shall  have  power,  when 
so  convened,  the  misconduct  of  a  competitor  having  been  re- 
ported to  them  by  a  member  of  the  Committee  or  an  Umpire,  to 
disqualify  the  offender,  and  further  to  order  him  off  the  ground, 
should  his  misconduct  appear  to  them  to  justify  such  action,  but 
before  such  action  shall  be  taken,  an  opportunity  of  offering  an 
explanation  shall  be  afforded  to  the  competitor,  whose  miscon- 
duct has  been  reported  to  them. 

9.â It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpireâ 

(a)  To  ascertain  that  the  net  is  at  the  right  height  before 
the  commencement  of  play,  and  to  measure  and  adjust  the 
net  during  play,  if  asked  to  do  so,  or  if,  in  his  opinion,  its 
height  has  altered. 

(b)  To  call  the  faults  (subject  to  Regulation  10)  and  lets 
unless   he   delegates   such  power. 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to 
call  them,  and  to  record  them  upon  the  Umpire's  scoring  sheet. 
(See  example  on  next  page.) 

Noteâ At  the  end  of  each  game  the  games  should  be  called  with  the 
name  of  the  player  who  is  in  advance,  thus:  "2  games  to  1,  B  wins" 
or,  "B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  called  thus, 
"three  games  all,"  or  as  the  case  may  be.  At  the  end  of  each  set  the 
sets  should  be  called  In  like  manner.

40 â 30,  game  (A.B.)"  In  the  second  game:  "Love â 15,  15  all,  15 â 30, 
30  all,  40 â 30,  deuce,  advantage  (CD.),  deuce,  advantage  (A.B.), 
deuce,  advantage  (CD.),  game  (CD.)"

Provided,  that  no  omission  of  any  of  the  foregoing  duties 
on  the  part  of  an  Umpire  shall  of  itself  invalidate  a  game  or 
match. 

10. â It  is  the  duty  of  the  Linesman  to  call  faults  and  to  decide 
strokes  relating  to  the  line  or  lines  to  which  he  is  assigned  and  to 
said  line  or  lines  only,  and  such  decision  shall  be  final.  Should  the 
Linesman  be  unable  to  give  a  decision,  the  Umpire  shall  decide 
or  shall  direct  the  stroke  to  be  played  again. 


In  scoring  handicap  matches,  the  odds  received  should  be  marked 
by  crosses  on  the  right  of  the  first  perpendicular  thick  line  before  the

11.  The  decision  of  an  Umpire  shall  be  final  upon  every  ques- 
tion of  fact,  and  no  competitor  may  appeal  from  it ;  but  if  an

use  the  table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  rep- 
resenting the  class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the 
horizontal  column  until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which 
bears  at  the  top  the  number  of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player. 
The  odds  specified  at  the  intersection  of  the  two  columns  are 
the  odds  required. 


214  Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual. 

Example. â If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9,  start  from  the  figure 
3  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the 
vertical  column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds 
given  at  the  point  of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15 
and  1-6  of  15)  are  the  odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players 
entered  is  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap 
the  best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet, 
the  inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed 
by  the  superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table,  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the 
class  of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal 
line  of  figures  at  the  top,  and  tht  class  of  the  inferior  player  in 
the  diagonal  line  of  figures. 

Example.â If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6 
of  15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21. â In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as 
above,  advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22. â The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competi- 
tor or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a 
match  if,  in  their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the 
light,  or  the  condition  of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  ren- 
der it  advisable  to  do  so.  In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  26 
must  be  strictly  observed.

INSTRUCTIONS    FOR   HANDICAPPING. 

GIVEN    ODDS. 

One-sixth  of  fifteen  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  given  by  the  better  to 
the  poorer  player  on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth  and  every 
subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  of  fifteen  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  eighth,  tenth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  of  fifteen  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  given 
on  the  second,  fourth,  sixth  and  every  other  alternate  game  on 
each  set. 

Four-sixths  of  fifteen  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  sixth,  eighth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  corresponding 
games  on  each  set. 

Five-sixths  of  fifteen  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
third,  fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth 
and  corresponding  games  on  each  set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  given  on  every  game  of  each  set. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  one-sixth,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  two-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty)  is  two  strokes 
given  on  the  same  games  as  for  three-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on 
each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the 
same  games  as  for  four-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 

Fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  is  tvv^o  strokes  on  the  ^same 
games  as  for  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Thirty  (30)  is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2)^ 
thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- forty),  thirty  and  four- 
sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  are 
three  strokes  and  two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each 
set,  as  in  the  fifteen  series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  odds  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  sarne 
quantities,  the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is 
required  to  earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score, 
while,  in  the  case  of  given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his 
handicap  before  play  starts.  These  owed  odds  may  be  used 
either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds  or  separately.  In  order 
that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as  possible  in  the  same 


220  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes  odds  and 
ihc  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes  are 
paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds : 

One-sixth  (i-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thir- 
teenth and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first, 
third,  fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth, 
sixth  and  corresponding- games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth, 
fifth,  sixth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Fifteen  (15)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2), 
fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four- 
sixths  (15.4),  fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  thirty  (30),  thirty  and 
one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2).  thirty  and  three- 
sixths  (30.3  or  half- forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty 
and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40).  correspond  to  the  fractions 
of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger  handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds 
correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort 
out  the  entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes 
according  to  the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the 
class  with  the  greatest  number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them 
on  scratch,  handicapping  all  of  the  other  players  either  behind 
or  in  advance  of  scratch  by  owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make 
all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  com- 
pared with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then 
as  compared  with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables 
of  odds.  Each  player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the 
object  of  handicapping  is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no 
matter  whom  his  opponent  may  be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any 
fraction  of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given, 
the  poorer  player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the 
end  of  the  game,  and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best 
men  must  be  very  great  to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should 
they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorest  players  over  30.3 
(half- forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds 
run  higher  than  30.     If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  221 

poorest  players  is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary 
behind  scratch,  but  do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30, 
or  30.3  in  the  most  extreme  cases. 


HOW    TO    CONDUCT    A    TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with 
not  less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  work- 
ers who  have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the 
interests  of  the  club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should 
decide  upon  all  details  of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is 
advisable  to  choose  one  immediately  before  or  after  some  estab- 
lished tournament  in  the  neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of 
those  who  are  to  play  in  the  other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
official  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and  other  par- 
ticulars. If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme, 
official  recognition  must  be  rpplied  for  before  these  titles  can  be 
of  any  value. 

A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  com- 
mittee, which  should  state  plainly â â (!)  the  name  of  the  club  and 
the  location  of  the  courts ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the 
hours  of  play;  (3)  the  lists  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles 
(if  any)  to  be  competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each 
event;  (4)  the  amount  of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date 
for  closing  the  list  of  entries;  (5)  the  name  of  referee,  handi- 
capper  and  tournament  committee ;  and  (6)  the  time  and  place  of 
the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public 
and  due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors, 
so  that  they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is 
made.  The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall- Wilde 
system.     (See  "Tournament  Regulations,"  page  204.) 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  on 
prizes,  for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  compe- 
tition as  amateurs.  Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  ob- 
jects of  art  or  other  souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked 
or  engraved  as  trophies.  It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked 
before  the  tournament,  although  lawn  tennis  prizes  are  fre- 
quently bought  with  the  privilege  of  exchange,  and  therefore  not 
engraved  until  after  the  tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their 
number  or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee 
may   also   be  the   handicapper,   or   a   sub-committee   may  be   ap- 


222  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

pointed  for  this  purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competi- 
tor, a  substitute  should  also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  i? 
playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality 
of  tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  r.  the  cus- 
tom at  most  tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  eacli 
match,  but  in  playing  on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  some- 
times be  made  to  do  service  twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops 
close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also  well  to  have  some  small  boys 
handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack"  the  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh 
every  day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the 
same  day.  The  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  sc 
that  one  player  will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring 
sunlight  in  his  eyes.  There  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow 
distance  of  a  tournament  court  either,  particularly  on  the  south 
side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend 
to  these  accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players 
and  see  that  their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on 
the  grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can 
inspect  it.  If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be 
made  out  in  advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the 
day  be  posted  up  by  the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be 
numbered,  and  a  certain  court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One 
member  of  the  committee  ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting 
umpires  for  the  matches  and  seeing  that  they  are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tourntment  at  the 
club  grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an 
attractive  feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the 
grounds,  all  duly  labelled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events 
they  are  to  be  given  for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  atti"active 
feature  at  a  tournament  and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under 
this  tent  on  the  same  or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl- 
Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers,  cakes  and  sometimes  small  sand- 
wiches are  generally  served  to  the  players  and  spectators  under 
such  refreshment  tent.

SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


WHAT  TO  USE  FOR  LAWN  TENNIS 

To  the  majority  of  those  who  play  lawn  tennis,  the  racket  is 
practically  the  only  implement  of  play  which  has  to  be  selected 
by  them  personally.  This,  then,  is  the  article  in  which  the  greater 
number  are  interested  and  it  shall  therefore  be  considered  first. 
Naturally  the  list  of  styles  and  qualities  on  the  market  is  a  long 
one,  but  the  line  which  is  recognized  as  standard,  and  in  which 
will  be  found  the  greater  number  of  approved  models,  is  that 
made  up  by  A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros. 

In  tennis  the  social  status  of  the  players  is  more  nearly  equal 
than  in  such  games  as  base  ball,  foot  ball,  etc.,  and  the  differ- 
ences in  prices  between  rackets  which  appear  to  the  unpracticed 
eye  as  very  much  alike  cannot  be  accounted  for  by  a  desire  of 
the  manufacturers  to  make  up  goods  to  suit  pocketbooks  of  var- 
ious sizes.  The  gradations  of  price  in  these  goods  occur  more 
particularly  on  account  of  some  detail  of  manufacture  which 
makes  the  more  costly,  at  the  same  time  the  more  suited,  to  the 
expert  player  than  the  cheaper  grades  on  which  the  same  amount 
of  labor  cannot  be  expended,  and  consequently  these  latter  do  not 
possess  the  same  nicety  of  balance  and  perfection  of  finish  which 
is  found  in  the  better  grades. 

The  selection  of  a  racket  is  something  that  the  player  should 
attend  to  personally.  Balance  and  weight  must  be  considered 
well  before  making  a  purchase,  and  much  care  should  be  exer- 
cised in  picking  out  a  racket  which  feels  good  to  handle,  not 
heavy  enough  to  appear  clumsy,  nor  light  enough  to  make  a  fast 
service  an  impossibility.  For  a  man  of  ordinary  strength  14  or 
14^  ounces  will  generally  suit â seldom  heavier  than  this  and 
very  rarely  below.  The  wrist  is  the  determining  factor.  The 
handle  generally  preferred  is  the  combed  cedar  or  mahogany, 
which  is  just  rough  enough  to  give  a  good  grip. 

The  Spalding  Model  Rackets  are  modeled  after  those  used 
by  the  best  players  of  recent  years.     With  beveled  frame,  combed 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL, 

mahogany  handle  and  polished  mahogany  throatpiece,  Models  A 
and  D  cost  $7.00.  They  are  well  taped  at  bow,  and  in  finish  and 
quality  of  material  they  cannot  be  surpassed.  Model  C  costs 
$7.50  and  is  equipped  with  spliced  cane  handle  extending  through 
the  walnut  throatpiece,  but  otherwise  is  identical  in  quality  with 
Models  A  and  D.  Corresponding  with  these,  but  with  handles 
much  larger  to  suit  players  who  desire  them  so,  Models  AA,  DD 
and  CC  complete  the  line  of  Spalding  highest  quality  rackets,  on 
which  no  expense  has  been  spared  to  make  them  absolutely  the 
finest  in  material  and  workmanship  and  the  most  perfect  in  model 
cf  any  so  far  produced. 

The  Spalding  Ocomo  costs  $6.00,  and  is  made  up  particularly 
for  ladies'  use.  It  is  made  of  finest  white  ash  with  rounded 
edges,  taped  bow  and  mahogany  throatpiece.  At  the  same  price 
the  Spalding  Tournament  is  sterling  value  and  will  give  excel- 
lent satisfaction.  The  next  mentioned  in  the  order  of  price  is 
the  Spalding  'Varsity  at  $5.00,  although  the  'Varsity  Cork 
Handle  at  $5.50  must  not  be  forgotten ;  both  are  modeled  on  the 
Expert  Spalding  shape.  Popular  still,  although  the  model  is 
not  approved  by  some  of  the  newer  players,  the  Spalding  Slocum 
at  $4.00  each  and  the  Slocum  Junior  at  $3.00  each,  are  welcomed 
by  players  who  have  clung  to  this  game  through  its  various  vicis- 
situdes as  they  do  to  this  rrodel,  recognizing  in  both  sterling 
qualities  valuable  both  to  a  game  and  an  implement  of  play. 

Beginners  may  want  rackets  cheaper  in  price  than  those  men- 
tioned above,  but  no  matter  what  price  is  paid  for  it,  value  com- 
mensurate with  price  is  found  in  all  which  bear  the  Spalding 
trade  mark.  The  Vantage  costs  $3.50,  the  Lakeside  $2.50,  both 
well  worth  the  price,  but  a  dollar's  difference  between  the  two. 
The  latter  racket  is  also  made  in  a  special  model  with  a  handle 
somewhat  larger  than  in  the  regular  style.  This  is  listed  as 
No.  5X,  and  costs  $2.50,  After  these  come  the  Greenwood  at 
$2.00,  the  Geneva  at  $1.50  and  the  Favorite  at  $1.00.  The  Prac- 
tice is  a  racket  for  children  and  costs  75  cents. 

Take  good  care  of  your  racket  if  you  want  it  to  give  satisfac- 
tion.    Remember,  it  is  strung  with  material  that  is  very  suscep- 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 


tible  to  dampness,  and  when  it  breaks  do  not  always  blame  the 
manufacturer.  Dry  heat  will  warp  the  frame,  too,  so  that  ex- 
tremes are  to  be  avoided  in  the  atmosphere  of  the  room  or  closet 
where  it  is  kept,  and  if  play  is  continued  in  the  evening  until  the 
dew  is  on  the  ground,  or  if  court  is  near  the  sea,  it  is  well  to 
rub  any  moisture  off  the  stringing  with  a  cloth  before  putting 
the  racket  away  in  the  case.  If  no  case  is  in  your  possession, 
a  press  should  be  used  to  keep  the  frame  in  shape,  this  especially 
so  at  the  seashore. 

The  best  racket  case  is  the  Spalding  No.  5 ;  it  is  made  of  stiff 
leather,  holds  one  racket  and  costs  $5.00.  The  same,  but  made 
for  two  rackets,  is  the  Spalding  No.  7,  which  costs  $7.50.    A  very 


good  mackiniosh  cuvcr,  thoroughly  waterproof  and  substan- 
tially made,  costs  $1.00.  This  is  the  Spalding  No.  4.  One  made 
of  canvas,  leather  bound,  listed  as  Spalding's  No.  2,  costs  75, 
cents,  while  their  No.  i,  made  of  soft  felt  in  a  variety  of  colors,. 


costs  50  cents. 


By  far  the  most  practical 
form  of  press  and  one  which 
will  effectually  prevent  the 
frame  warping  is  the  shape 
made  by  Spalding  and  listed  as 
No.  iR.  It  costs  $1.00  each, 
and  the  same  style,  No.  2R,, 
made  to  hold  two  rackets  cost 
$2.00. 

Some  players  like  a  rubber 
covering  for  the  racket  handle 
to  secure  a  better  grip.  These 
are  made  in  two  styles.     With 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


X 


circular  corrugations,  the  Spalding  No.  i  costs  25  cents,  while 
the  No.  2,  with  pin-head  corrugations,  costs  35  cents.  Both 
are  made  of  an  excellent  quality  of  rubber  and  are  red  in  color. 
After  the  racket  has  been  in  use  for  a  season  or  so,  a  necessity 
will  very  likely  exist  for  restringing.  This  should  be  done  in 
the  proper  manner,  and  it  really  pays  in  the  end  to  have  some  re- 
liable firm  do  the  work  for  you.  Spalding  uses  three  different 
â¢qualities  of  gut  for  restringing  and  the  prices  are :  for  Best  Eng- 
lish, $275;  Best  American,  $1.75;  Good  American,  $1.25  each. 
Remember,  the  frame  of  a  racket  can  be  pulled  out  of  shape 
very  easily  by  an  inexperienced  person  in  stringing,  and  the 
same  rendered  absolutely  valueless  thereby.  Spalding  employs 
â experts,  and  if  possible  the  racket  frame  is  improved  in  shape 
after  going  through  their  hands  rather  than  otherwise.

'  purchasing  something  that 
looks  like  what  he  used, 
but  the  similarity  of  which 
does  not  go  below  the  felt 
cover.  The  best  grade 
ball,  and  one  that  is  guar- 
anteed absolutely  perfection,  is  the  Spalding  Championship  No. 
2/0,  which  costs  $4.00  per  dozen.  The  adopted  ball  is  made  by 
Wright  &  Ditson  and  costs  $5.00  per  dozen.  A  ball  of  uniform 
quality,  carefully  constructed  and  warranted  to  give  satisfaction, 
is  the  Spalding  Tournament  No.  o,  which  costs  $3.50  per  dozen. 
A  cheaper  grade  of  felt-covered  ball  is  the  Spalding  Vantage  at 
$3.00  per  dozen.     This  latter  will   do  for  practice. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Although  every  one  who  wishes  to  play  the  game  may  not 
have  a  place  to  play,  it  is  generally  possible  to  find  a  plot  of 
ground  which  can  be  arranged  suitably,  and  the  expense  of  im- 
proving same  and  keeping  it  in  good  order  borne  by  a  small 
circle  among  those  of  your  friends  who  wish  to  play.  If  this 
cannot  be  done,  the  would-be  player  can  generally  obtain  ad- 
mittance to  some  already  organized  club,  while  in  some  of  the 
larger  cities  grounds  are  let  out  by  the  hour,  so  that  the  problem 
of  where  to  play  need  not  bother  the  aspirant  for  honors  on  the 
tennis  court  if  he  makes  an  effort  at  all  to  obtain  the  information. 
Presuming  that  you  have  found  a  suitable  plot  of  ground,  have  it 
worked  up  to  the  point  where  it  can  be  used  for  a  tennis  court. 
The  next  matter  to  consider  will  be  the  equipment  that  will  be 
necessary  to  fit  it  up  for  playing.  ., 

The  poles  must  be  purchased  first.  They  are  made  in  a  num- 
ber of  styles  and  the  prices  range  from  one  to  twenty  dollars 
per  pair.  If  you  want  the  best,  most  decidedly  get  the  Spalding 
Championship  No.  A,  which  cost  $20.00  and  are  worth  every 
penny  of  the  price.  They  are  ^quare  poles  of  3)^  inch  ash,  finely 
polished,  with  heavy  japanned  iron  bases  and  ratchet  crank  of 
special  design,  wi'Ji  which  the  net  can  be  drawn  taut  when  it 
sags  in  the  middle.  An  iron  corkscrew  holds  the  pole  itself 
firmly  in  place,  being  fixed  permanently  in  the  ground  marking 
the  place  where  the  poles  should  be  set.  To  steady  them  in 
case  the  ground  is  soft,  iron  clutches  are  included  in  the  equip- 
ment furnished  with  them.  The  Spalding  Tournament  poles  No. 
B  cost  $10.00  per  pair.  The  pole  itself  is  made  of  square  2^-inch 
ash,  finely  finished,  and  the  base  of  heavy  japanned  iron,  a  ratchet 
crank  for  tightening  net  being  also  placed  on  this  pole.  Iron  pins 
for  fastening  the  bases  to  the  ground  are  packed  with  the  poles. 
A  style  that  is  absolutely  first  class  and  one  which  has  steadily 
increased  in  popularity  during  the  years  it  has  been  on  the  mar- 
ket, is  the  one  that  Spalding  lists  as  the  Casino  No.  C,  and  which 
costs  $6.00  per  pair.  They  are  round  poles,  have  heavy  japanned 
iron  bases  and  pins  for  fastening  to  the  ground,  together  with 
ratchet  crank  for  tightening  net.     If  poles  are  required  which  are 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


to  be  left  up  permanently,  by  far  the  best  style  is  the  Spalding 
No.  D,  which  costs  $3.00  per  pair.  They  have  an  iron  bracket 
brace  on  the  side  to  keep  them  firm  and  are  nicely  painted,  making 
a  very  handsome  appearance.  These  are  inserted  eighteen  inches 
into  the  ground  and  need  no  guy  ropes  or  pegs.  The  Spalding 
No.  "E  poles  cost  $2.00  per  pair.  They  are  finely  polished,  solid 
and  spiked,  and  are  packed  complete  with  guy  ropes  and  pegs. 
For  $1.00  per  pair  you  can  obtain  a  fair  quality  pole â the  Spald- 
ing No.  F â also  complete  with  guy  ropes  and  pegs.

Now  as  to  the  net.  This  will  have  to  be  selected  according  to 
whether  you  have  a  double  or  single  court  to  fit  out.  Although 
the  Spalding  No.  i  measures  27  feet  and  costs  75  cents,  still  even 
for  a  single  court  it  will  be  well  to  pick  out  a  net  measuring 
36  feet.     The  cheaper  grades  are  machine  made  and  the   No.  2 


SPALDING  S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 


Â«    "    Â« 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


costs  $1.00.  A  double  court  net  42  feet  long,  of  same  grade  as 
these  other  two,  costs  $1.50.  It  is  a  question  whether  in  the 
long  run  it  is  not  better  to  get  a  good  quality  hand  made  net. 
It  is  also  important  to  have  it  bound  with  a  wide  strip  of  white 
canvas  at  the  top.  This  will  help  the  players  by  enabling  them  to 
see  the  top  of  the  net  at  a  glance.     Spalding's  No.  2B,  which

measures  36  feet  and  is  made  of  21  thread  white  twine  and  can- 
vas bound,  hand-made  throughout,  costs  $3.00.  The  same  grade, 
but  42  feet  long â No.  3B â costs  $3.50.  Corresponding  to  these  in 
machine  made  nets  of  15  thread  twine,  the  36  foot' style,  No.  2A, 
costs  $2.00,  and  the  42  foot,  No.  3A,  $2.25.  The  Spalding  Inter- 
collegiate   nets    have    given    excellent    satisfaction    and    are    very 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


popular.  They  are  liand  knit  of  21  thread  twine,  and  have  extra 
wide  white  canvas  strip  at  top.  This  style  and  quality  is  used  at 
Newport  and  if  desired  tanned  nets  will  be  furnished  at  same 
price.  No.  2E,  Intercollegiate,  36  feet,  21  thread,  costs  $3.75,  and 
the  same,  but  measuring  42  feet.  No.  3E,  costs  $4.25.  A  net  with 
double  centre  should  be  used  on  a  court  where  there  are  men 
who  hit  the  ball  hard  and  fast.  This  is  a  patented  feature  of  the 
Spalding  nets.  The  No.  2C  is  36  feet  long,  with  11  feet  of  15 
thread  twine  double  knitted  in  the  centre,  and  costs  $4.50  each. 
No.  2D  is  the  same,  but  of  21-thread  twine,  and  costs  $5.00  each. 
No.  3C  costs  $5.00,  is  42  feet  long  and  has  13  feet  of  15  thread 
twine  double  knitted  in  the  centre.  The  same,  but  of  21  thread 
twine,  is  listed  as  Spalding's  No.  3D  and  costs  $5-50. 

Where  it  is  not  convenient  to  take  the  net  in  every  night  it 
would  be  well  to  have  a  tarred  net.  No  2X  is  canvas  bound,  36 
feet  long,  and  is  made  of  21  thread  twine.  It  will  withstand 
the  elements  and  give  good  satisfaction  for  a  long  time.     It  costs 


Canvas  Centre  Strap. 

$4.00.  The  same,  but  42  feet  long,  No.  3X,  costs  $4.50-  To  keep 
the  centre  of  the  net  at  the  required  height  a  strap  or  fork  should 
be  used,  preferably  the  former,  as  there  is  then  no  danger  of 
the  ball  glancing  off  and  striking  out  of  court,  as  is  occasionally 
the  case  with  an  iron  centre  fork.  No.  3/0  Centre  Strap  costs 
$1.50  each,  is  Tournament  Pattern  and  has  a  turnbuckle  with 
which  height  of  net  can  be  adjusted  to  a  hair.     No  2/0  is  a  sim-

ilar  style  and  costs  $i.oo  each,  but  has  not  the  turnbuckle  attach- 
ment. Iron  centre  forks  are  made  in  two  styles:  No,  i.  regula- 
tion, patent  stirrups,  costs  $i.oo.  and  No.  2.  an  ordinary  iron 
fork,  costs  60  cents. 

For  the  same  reason  that  it  is  advisable  to  move  the  posts  from 
time  to  time  on  a  grass  court  in  order  to  save  the  turf,  it  will

also  be  necessary  to  have  some  arrangements  for  marking  llic 
lines  afresh  as  they  are  rubbed  or  washed  awaj'.  The  Spalding 
dry  marker  No.  2  costs  $2.00,  and  can  be  used  on  a  din  cor.;t

with  marble  dust,  slaked  lime,  etc.  The  Columbia  tennis  marker 
costs  $5.cx)  and  is  suitable  particularly  for  marking  grass  courts. 
It  has  a  tank  to  hold  the  marking  solution  and  the  tape  runs  over 
the  wheel  and  through  the  solution  giving  a  clean  even  ribbon 
line   with   contact   in   full   view.   ,  , 

It  is  well  to  have  a  set  of  marking  plates  for  permanently  mark- 
ing the  angles  of  court.  They  are  sunk  to  the  level  of  the  court 
and  must  not  under  any  circumstances  protrude  above.  Spalding 
makes  two  styles:  No.  i,  with  separate  pins,  costs  $i.oo  per  set; 
No.  2,  with  wedge  pins  attached,  $1.50  per  set.  Marking  tapes 
will  be  found  very  useful  and  particularly  convenient  where 
one  has  to  mark  out  the  court  himself.  Spalding's  No.  3  costs 
$3.50  per  set,  are  for  single  court,  and  come  complete  with   100

costs  $4.00  per  set,  complete  with  200  staples  and  14  pins;  No.  6 
are  also  for  double  court,  but  are  made  of  extra  quality  ca:ivas 
and  cost  $6.00  per  set  complete.  Waterproof  tapes  are  made  in 
one  style,  Spalding's  No.  7,  for  double  court.  They  cost  $8.0Q 
per  set  complete.  In  each  set  the  tapes  are  cut  in  proper  lengths 
for  each  line  of  the  court,  and  the  staples  and  pins  furnished  are 
sufficient   to  secure   it  by   using  them  at   frequent   intervals. 

Backstop  nets  will  be  required  and  for  them  also  poles  of 
suitable  height.  Spalding's  BS  poles  cost  $1.00  each.  No.  4  net 
measuring  50  feet  long  by  7  feet  high  and  made  of  9-thread 
twine,  costs  $2.50.  No.  5  net,  50  feet  long  by  8  feet  high  and  12- 
thread  twine  costs  $3.00.  Both  of  these  are  white.  A  tarred  back- 
stop net  is  listed  as  No.  5X  and  costs  $3.50.  It  is  50  feet  long, 
8  feet  high  and  made  of  12-thread  twine. 

By  long  odds,  however,  the  finest  arrangement  for  a  portable 
backstop  that  has  so  far  been  placed  on  the  market  is  the  Spalding

feet  long  by  7  feet  high,  cost  $25.00  and  additional  sections  can 
be  had  at  proportionate  price.  For  fitting  up  a  court  complete, 
perhaps  more  than  one  set  may  be  required,  but  they  are  well 
worth  the  price  that  is  asked  for  them  and  will  add  considerably 
to  the  general  appearance  of  the  court.
