Mathematical  modelling  of  vector-borne 
diseases  and  insecticide  resistance  evolution

Abstract 

Background:  Vector-borne  diseases  are  important  public  health  issues  and,  consequently,  in  silico  models  that 
simulate  them  can  be  useful.  The  susceptible-infected-recovered  (SIR)  model  simulates  the  population  dynamics  of  an 
epidemic  and  can  be  easily  adapted  to  vector-borne  diseases,  whereas  the  Hardy-Weinberg  model  simulates  allele 
frequencies  and  can  be  used  to  study  insecticide  resistance  evolution.  The  aim  of  the  present  study  is  to  develop  a 
coupled  system  that  unifies  both  models,  therefore  enabling  the  analysis  of  the  effects  of  vector  population  genetics 
on  the  population  dynamics  of  an  epidemic. 

Methods:  Our  model  consists  of  an  ordinary  differential  equation  system.  We  considered  the  populations  of 
susceptible,  infected  and  recovered  humans,  as  well  as  susceptible  and  infected  vectors.  Concerning  these  vectors, 
we  considered  a  pair  of  alleles,  with  complete  dominance  interaction  that  determined  the  rate  of  mortality  induced 
by  insecticides.  Thus,  we  were  able  to  separate  the  vectors  according  to  the  genotype.  We  performed  three  numerical 
simulations  of  the  model.  In  simulation  one,  both  alleles  conferred  the  same  mortality  rate  values,  therefore  there  was 
no  resistant  strain.  In  simulations  two  and  three,  the  recessive  and  dominant  alleles,  respectively,  conferred  a  lower 
mortality. 

Results:  Our  numerical  results  show  that  the  genetic  composition  of  the  vector  population  affects  the  dynamics  of 
human  diseases.  We  found  that  the  absolute  number  of  vectors  and  the  proportion  of  infected  vectors  are  smaller 
when  there  is  no  resistant  strain,  whilst  the  ratio  of  infected  people  is  larger  in  the  presence  of  insecticide-resistant 
vectors.  The  dynamics  observed  for  infected  humans  in  all  simulations  has  a  very  similar  shape  to  real  epidemiological 
data. 

Conclusion:  The  population  genetics  of  vectors  can  affect  epidemiological  dynamics,  and  the  presence  of 
insecticide-resistant  strains  can  increase  the  number  of  infected  people.  Based  on  the  present  results,  the  model  is  a 
basis  for  development  of  other  models  and  for  investigating  population  dynamics.

Background 

Vector-borne  diseases  represent  one  sixth  of  the  sick¬ 
nesses  suffered  by  the  global  population,  and  more  than 
50%  of  the  world  is  at  risk  of  coming  down  with  them 
[1].  One  of  the  most  common  vector-borne  diseases  is 
dengue  fever,  as  2.5  billion  people  from  more  than  100 
countries  are  infected  with  this  illness  [2].  Dengue  is  a

febrile  infectious  disease  caused  by  a  virus  of  the  fam¬ 
ily  Flaviridae ,  which  has  four  distinct  serotypes:  DENI, 
DEN2,  and  DEN3  DEN4.  The  transmission  mechanism 
is  through  bites  of  female  mosquitos  from  the  genus 
Aedes ,  especially  of  the  species  Aedes  aegypti  [3,  4].  Rapid 
and  unorganized  urban  growth,  which  is  related  to  a 
country’s  development  and  rural  flight,  contributes  to 
mosquito  proliferation  and,  consequently  to  the  epidemic 
of  this  urban  disease.  A  serious  characteristic  is  that  Aedes 
aegypti  can  also  transmit  the  zika  and  chikungunya  virus. 
The  triple  epidemic  dengue-zika-chikungunya  coexists  in 
many  endemic  areas  [5].  Despite  all  efforts,  developing

new  tools  and  improving  the  existing  strategies  is  very 
important,  necessary  and  still  far  from  ideal 

Therefore,  it  is  relevant  to  create  models  to  simulate  the 
phenomenology  of  epidemic  diseases  and  to  understand 
the  respective  dynamics.  This  kind  of  in  silico  research, 
performed  entirely  on  computer,  is  supposed  to  be  very 
advantageous.  As  mathematical  modelling  and  numeri¬ 
cal  simulation  involve  no  laboratorial  experiments,  they 
imply  economy  of  time  and  resources,  and  can  even  sub¬ 
stitute  pilot  experiments  [6] .  Furthermore,  as  they  involve 
no  live  models,  there  are  no  bioethical  restraints,  so  their 
association  with  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  experiments  can 
reduce  the  number  of  animals  that  would  undergo  stress¬ 
ful  and  harmful  situations  [6] . 

The  susceptible-infected-recovered  (SIR)  model  was 
firstly  proposed  by  Kermack  and  McKendrick  [7],  and 
since  then  many  studies  based  on  their  idea  have  been 
developed.  This  model  enables  scientists  to  simulate  the 
dynamics  of  a  population  under  an  epidemic  of  an  infec¬ 
tious  disease  over  time.  Three  classes  of  individuals  are 
considered  (Fig.  1):  susceptible,  those  who  are  at  risk  of 
contracting  the  disease;  infected,  those  people  who  have 
the  pathogen  in  their  organism  and  are  able  to  transmit 
it;  and  recovered,  those  who  have  been  cured  and  are 
immune  to  the  illness  [7].  The  original  SIR  model  focuses 
only  on  host-to-host  transmission  [7].  However,  there  is  a 
useful  class  of  SIR  models  to  study  vector-borne  diseases 
[8].  For  instance,  Bailey  [9]  described  the  susceptible- 
infected-recovered/susceptible-infected  (SIRSI)  model,  in 
which  the  host  population  is  divided  into  susceptible, 
infected  and  recovered,  and  the  vector  population  into 
susceptible  and  infected. 

Another  important  field  of  research  related  to  vector- 
borne  diseases  is  population  genetics,  specifically  stud¬ 
ies  regarding  the  selection  of  insecticide-resistant  vector 
strains  [10].  Population  genetics  is  the  branch  of  biology 
that  investigates  frequencies  of  alleles  and  genotypes  in 
populations  [11].  Resistant  strains  of  vectors  are  those  that 
resist  and  survive  the  effects  of  insecticides,  and  usually 
have  their  origin  in  genetic  causes  [12].  Positive  selec¬ 
tion  of  particular  phenotypes,  such  as  insecticide  resis¬ 
tance,  occur  because  they  confer  a  long-term  survival  or 
reproduction  rate  (i.e.,  a  greater  fitness  to  the  environ¬ 
ment),  and  therefore  individuals  that  express  them  have

becomes  infected,  which,  in  turn,  becomes  recovered.  S  =  susceptible; 
/  =  infected;  R  =  recovered 


more  chance  of  transmitting  their  genes  to  the  next  gen¬ 
eration.  Subsequently,  the  frequency  of  the  allele  which 
determines  resistance  increases  over  time,  and  so  does 
the  proportion  of  individuals  that  portray  this  gene  [13]. 
This  situation  is  an  example  of  the  natural  selection,  pro¬ 
posed  by  Darwin  [14].  The  importance  of  understanding 
the  genetics  of  vector  insecticide  resistance  is  emphasized 
in  the  Global  Plan  for  Insecticide  Resistance  Manage¬ 
ment  from  the  World  Health  Organization,  in  which  the 
relevance  of  theoretical  modelling  is  also  highlighted  [12]. 

In  population  genetics,  another  important  concept  is 
the  Hardy- Weinberg  equilibrium.  Its  conditions  are  the 
absence  of  evolutionary  factors,  including  the  natural 
selection.  To  make  it  possible,  all  the  allelomorphs  and 
genotypes  must  confer  the  same  fitness,  so  that  the  allele 
frequencies  remain  constant  over  time  [15].  In  addition, 
the  pattern  of  inheritance  must  be  Mendelian;  the  propor¬ 
tion  of  males  and  females  must  be  equal;  and  the  popula¬ 
tion  must  be  panmictic  and  large  [16].  Considering  only 
two  alleles,  the  Hardy- Weinberg  equilibrium  is  achieved 
when  the  proportions  of  the  genotypes  remain  constant 
and  are  represented  by  the  following  equation  [1]: 

p2  +  2pq  +  q2  =  l  (1) 

Where  p  and  q  are  the  frequencies  of  the  dominant  and 
the  recessive  allele,  respectively,  and p+q  =  l.p2,  2 pq  and 
q2  are  the  proportions  of  pure  dominants,  heterozygotes 
and  pure  recessives,  and  also  sum  1. 

Considering  all  this  information,  it  is  important  to  high¬ 
light  that  studying  the  alleles  which  confer  resistance  to 
the  vectors  might  influence  various  aspects  of  control 
strategies,  such  as  the  usage  of  insecticides  [17].  For  exam¬ 
ple,  in  Zambia,  this  kind  of  research  determined  that 
pyrethroids  should  not  be  used  anymore  in  insecticide 
rotation  strategies  for  Anopheles  sp.  control  [18].  Another 
example  is  the  work  of  Luz  et  al.  [19],  in  which  mathe¬ 
matical  simulations  were  used  to  determine  the  efficiency 
of  insecticide  control  against  A.  aegypti  and  to  study  the 
evolution  of  insecticide  resistance.  In  the  model  of  Luz 
et  al.  [19],  it  is  considered  that  the  insecticide  resistance 
is  linked  to  one  locus  with  two  alleles,  so  that  A.  aegypti 
is  divided  into  three  groups  according  to  the  genotype. 
The  incorporation  of  population  genetics  into  math¬ 
ematical  models  can  be  useful  for  investigation  of 
other  aspects  as  well.  For  example,  Schechtman  and 
Souza  [20]  developed  a  deterministic  mathematical  model 
based  on  A.  aegypti  that  considers  both  the  con¬ 
cept  of  Hardy- Weinberg  equilibrium  and  an  insecti¬ 
cide  resistance  gene  with  Mendelian  inheritance  pattern. 
In  the  research  of  Schechtman  and  Souza  [20],  compu¬ 
tational  simulations  were  performed  to  investigate  per¬ 
sistence  of  vector  insecticide  resistance  and  reversion  to 
insecticide  susceptibility.  Both  models  might  be  valuable 
tools  for  public  health  organizations  that  are  responsible

for  control  of  vector-borne  diseases.  However,  few  stud¬ 
ies  have  investigated  mathematical  models  that  couple  SIR 
models  and  population  genetics. 

In  this  study,  we  propose  a  mathematical  model  of 
ordinary  differential  equations  that  represents  a  vector- 
borne  disease  epidemic  and  connects  the  main  ideas  of 
SIR  mathematical  models  and  population  genetics.  Our 
model  is  based  on  arboviral  diseases,  specially  chikun- 
gunya,  dengue  and  yellow  fever.  Using  this  approach,  we 
considered  the  possibility  of  splitting  the  vector  popula¬ 
tion  according  to  the  genotype  into  three  groups,  each 
of  them  with  different  characteristics,  represented  by  dis¬ 
tinct  values  of  biological  parameters.  In  our  case,  we 
consider  different  mortality  values.  Therefore,  it  is  possi¬ 
ble  to  simulate  the  variation  of  the  genetic  composition 
of  vector  population  over  time.  There  are  two  primary 
aims  of  this  study:  1.  To  investigate  whether  the  dom¬ 
inance  of  an  insecticide  resistance  gene  influences  the 
epidemics  dynamics  2.  To  create  a  model  that  inte¬ 
grates  epidemiology  and  population  genetics,  from  which 
more  sophisticated  models  and  new  approaches  can  be 
developed. 

Methods 

We  took  into  account  infectious  diseases  that  affect 
humans  and  are  transmitted  by  an  insect  vector,  specially 
arboviral  diseases,  such  as  yellow  fever  and  chikungunya. 

General  assumptions 

First  of  all,  in  order  to  better  understand  our  model, 
the  assumptions  we  made  for  its  development  should  be 
mentioned: 

•  Assumption  1:  The  breeding  in  the  populations  is 
random,  i.e.,  all  the  individuals  have  the  same  chance 
of  reproduction  and  they  mate  with  any  other 
individual  in  the  population  with  the  same 
probability; 

•  Assumption  2:  The  disease  is  transmitted  only 
horizontally.  Vertical  transmission  occurs  in  real 
situations,  but  we  disregarded  it  in  order  to  present  a 
clearer  model; 

•  Assumption  3:  There  are  no  evolutionary  factors 
except  for  the  biological  selection  (we  disregard 
genetic  drift  and  mutation,  for  instance),  because  of 
the  same  reason  presented  in  the  previous 
assumption; 

•  Assumption  4:  The  lifetime  span  of  the  vectors  is  not 
long  enough  for  the  recovery  of  an  infected  insect; 

•  Assumption  5:  There  are  no  immigrants  or 
emigrants  in  the  populations  considered,  since 
considering  human  mobility  would  imply  additional 
features,  such  as  separation  of  population  into  patches 
[21],  which  is  not  the  focus  of  this  investigation. 


Development  of  the  model 
Human  populations 

In  our  model,  we  considered  both  the  populations  of 
humans  and  vectors.  The  humans  were  divided  into  sus¬ 
ceptible,  infected  and  recovered  (Fig.  2).  New  human 
individuals  are  introduced  into  the  susceptible  population 
according  to  expression  c  •  Nh,  in  which  c  is  the  birth  rate 
and  Nh  is  the  total  human  population.  Susceptible  humans 
are  infected  when  they  are  bitten  by  an  infected  vec¬ 
tor,  which  happens  at  a  probability  /3h.  Infected  humans 
recover  at  a  rate  y,  and  the  human  mortality  rate  is  /x/z, 
which  does  not  vary  with  the  compartment  considered. 


Population  genetics 

We  take  into  account  a  pair  of  alleles  in  the  vector 
population.  These  alleles  determine  the  presence  or  not 
of  insecticide  resistance,  and,  consequently,  the  value 
of  the  animals  mortality  rate.  They  hold  an  interaction  of 
complete  dominance.  We  represented  the  recessive  allelo¬ 
morph  by  a  and  the  dominant  one  by  A.  We  calculated  the 
frequency  of  each  allele  by  [22]: 


f(a)  =  q  = 


f{A)  =  p  = 


2A laa  +  Nau 
2  Nt

where  Naa,  Nacu  A Iaa  and  Nt  are  the  populations  of  reces¬ 
sive  homozygotes,  heterozygotes,  dominant  homozygotes, 
and  the  total  population,  respectively. 

Considering  the  frequencies  of  the  alleles,  the  probabil¬ 
ity  of  there  being  a  gamete  portraying  allele  A  is  p  and 
allele  a  is  q.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  the  formation

and  recessive  homozygotes,  respectively,  for  the  Susceptible  (S) 
and  Infected  (/)  mosquito  populations.  5/,,  lh  and  Rh  are  the  susceptible, 
infected  and  susceptible  compartments  for  humans.  Vectors  become 
infected  when  they  interact  with  an  infected  host;  and  susceptible 
humans  become  infected  when  they  are  bitten  by  an  infected  vector

of  each  genotype  during  fertilization  is  given  in  Table  1 
below. 

Consequently,  the  proportion  of  the  genotypes  aa ,  Aa 
and  AA  in  the  next  generation  in  time  t  +  1  can  be  calcu¬ 
lated  by  p2,  2 pq  and  q 2 ,  in  this  order.  Considering  that  6 
is  the  vector  birth  rate  and  that  the  total  population  in  the 
next  generation  is  equal  to  Nt  •  0,  we  have  the  following 
equations:

Vector  populations 

As  we  considered  a  pair  of  alleles  for  the  vector 
population,  we  could  separate  the  vector  population 
into  recessive  homozygotes,  heterozygotes  and  dominant 
homozygotes.  Each  of  these  compartments  were  subdi¬ 
vided  into  susceptible  and  infected  (Fig.  2).  New  indi¬ 
viduals  are  introduced  into  the  populations  through  the 
susceptible  compartment,  according  to  what  is  described 
in  the  previous  item.  Susceptible  insects  become  infected 
when  they  bite  infected  humans,  with  a  probability  pv. 
This  way,  pv  represents  the  proportion  of  vectors  that 
effectively  gets  infected.  This  parameter  is  particularly 
useful  because  field  studies  demonstrate  that  only  a  small 
percentage  of  vectors  gets  infected  with  the  pathogen  [23] . 

The  mortality  rate  has  two  components:  the  natural 
mortality  rate  (pn),  whose  value  is  equal  for  all  vector 
groups  considered  here;  and  the  insecticide-induced  mor¬ 
tality  rate  (/x/),  whose  value  was  smaller  for  the  resistant 
strain  and  greater  for  the  wild  type.  Eq.  10  shows  the  com¬ 
ponents  of  the  total  mortality  rate.  We  considered  paa , 
PAa  and  paa  as  the  total  mortality  rates  for  recessive 
homozygotes,  heterozygotes  and  dominant  homozygotes, 


respectively.  As  allele  A  is  dominant  over  a  and  we  con¬ 
sider  a  complete  dominance  interaction,  pAa  and  paa  will 
always  have  the  same  value. 

PT  =  I^N  +  l^I  (10) 

This  way,  according  to  our  system,  the  increase  in 
susceptible  vector  populations  is  dependent  of  allele  fre¬ 
quencies  and  total  vector  population,  and  limited  by  a 
carrying  capacity  ( I< ).  The  decrease  of  susceptible  vector 
population  is  proportional  to  its  own  size  and  the  per¬ 
centage  of  vectors  that  become  infected.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  increase  in  infected  vector  populations  is  depen¬ 
dent  on  the  proportion  of  infected  humans  an<l  on 
the  number  of  susceptible  vectors  with  the  correspon¬ 
dent  genotype  («SV).  In  contrast,  the  decrease  of  infected 
vector  populations  is  proportional  only  to  its  own  size, 
independently  of  other  populations. 

The  system  of  ordinary  differential  equations 

Our  model  was  based  on  the  one  proposed  by  Santos  [21]. 
The  variables  and  parameters  are  summarized  in  Tables  2, 
3  and  4.  Our  mathematical  model  can  be  represented  by 
the  following  system  of  ordinary  differential  equations: 

I  =cNh-(e$+Hh)sh 

It  =  ^Nh^h  —  (y  +  Hh)Ih

Computational  simulations 

The  simulations  were  made  using  the  software  MatLab  . 
We  ran  the  discrete  form  of  system  11,  which  was  obtained 
through  the  Euler  method  (Additional  file  1).  The  time, 
which  was  measured  in  days,  varied  from  0  to  100,  and 
At  was  equal  to  0.1.  The  parameter  values  were  obtained 
from  Santos  [21]  and  are  shown  in  Tables  2  and  4.  The 
initial  values  of  the  variables  are  shown  in  Table  3.  We 
assume  the  initial  vector  population  is  the  double  of  the

one,  we  considered  that  both  alleles  (< a  and  A)  conferred 
a  mortality  rate  of  0.25day_1.  In  this  case,  we  intended 
to  simulate  the  Hardy- Weinberg  equilibrium  conditions, 
in  which  all  the  individuals  of  a  population  have  the 
same  chance  of  surviving  and  reproducing,  regardless 
of  its  genotype.  This  situation  would  also  represent  the 
absence  of  an  insecticide-resistant  strain,  i.e.,  a  popu¬ 
lation  totally  susceptible  to  insecticides.  In  the  other 
two  simulations,  we  aimed  to  simulate  the  presence  of 
an  insecticide-resistant  strain  and  the  natural  selection, 


which  is  characterized  by  differential  reproduction  and 
survival  of  organism.  For  this  reason,  in  the  second  sim¬ 
ulation,  the  recessive  allele  attributed  a  smaller  mortality 
value,  while  the  dominant  allelomorph  conferred  a  higher 
rate.  Finally,  the  last  simulation  was  similar,  but  then  the 
dominant  allele  conferred  a  greater  fitness.  The  values  of 
the  mortality  rates  can  be  seen  in  Table  4. 

We  also  did  four  other  minor  simulations.  One  of  them 
was  similar  to  simulation  1,  but  the  time  ranged  from 
t  =  0  to  t  =  500.  The  other  three  simulations  were  analo¬ 
gous  to  the  three  main  simulations,  except  by  the  fact  that 
the  initial  values  of  variables  were  ten  times  smaller  than 
the  values  shown  in  Table  3,  and  At  =  0.01.  These  simu¬ 
lations  with  smaller  populations  are  referred  as  Is,  2s  and 
3s.  Is,  2s  and  3s  have,  respectively,  no  insecticide-resistant 
gene,  recessive  insecticide  resistance  gene  and  dominant 
insecticide  resistance  gene.

Results 

Simulation  1 

Figures  3  and  4  show  the  graphs  obtained  from  simulation 
1,  in  which  we  aim  to  represent  the  Hardy- Weinberg  equi¬ 
librium  conditions,  and  a  population  without  resistant 
strains.  In  Fig.  3a,  the  human  populations  are  represented. 
The  number  of  susceptible  humans  decreases  until  it 
reaches  the  value  zero,  while  the  population  of  recovered 


humans  increases  almost  linearly.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
population  of  infected  humans  raised  to  a  peak  at  time  28 
and  then  diminished.  In  relation  to  the  vectors  (Fig.  3b,  c 
and  d),  their  populations  exhibited  both  periods  of  growth 
and  decline.  The  proportion  of  A_  vectors  were  always 
greater  than  the  proportion  of  recessive  homozygotes, 
except  in  the  initial  time,  when  their  values  were  the  same. 

The  frequencies  of  the  dominant  ( p  =  0.375)  and  the 
recessive  allele  ( q  =  0.625)  remained  constant  during  the 
whole  time  considered,  as  expected  for  the  absence  of  evo¬ 
lution  factors.  According  to  Fig.  4b,  the  genotype  frequen¬ 
cies  varied  very  fast  at  the  beginning  of  the  simulation,  and

then  they  started  to  increase  or  decrease  very  slowly.  The 
Hardy -Weinberg  equilibrium  would  be  achieved  when: 

f(aa)  =  q2  =  0.390625 
f(Aa)  =  2pq  =  0.468750 
f(AA)  =p2  =  0.140625 

According  to  another  simulation  with  the  same  condi¬ 
tions,  but  in  a  longer  time  frame,  the  Hardy- Weinberg 
equilibrium  is  achieved  at  t  =  488.  Note  that  f(aa)  + 
f(Aa)  +f(AA)  =  1. 

Simulation  2 

The  results  of  simulation  2,  in  which  the  recessive  allele 
conferred  a  greater  fitness,  are  shown  in  Figs.  5  and  6. 
The  recessive  homozygotes  represent  the  resistant  strain, 
which  is  positively  selected. 

Regarding  the  humans  (Fig.  5a),  the  susceptible  popu¬ 
lation  decreased  during  the  whole  time  considered,  until 
the  zero  value.  The  infected  population  increased  until 
time  27  of  the  simulation  and  then  reduced  up  to  the 
end  of  simulation.  Finally,  the  recovered  population  had 
an  approximately  linear  growth.  This  human  dynamics  is 
approximately  similar  to  simulation  1,  although  the  val¬ 
ues  vary  lightly.  On  the  other  hand,  the  vector  population 
showed  different  dynamics  (Fig.  5b  and  c).  The  dynam¬ 
ics  of  the  susceptible  vectors  (Fig.  5c)  can  be  split  into 
two  moments.  In  the  first  one,  the  populations  increased 
quickly  and  the  proportion  of  A_  individuals  was  greater 
than  that  of  aa  individuals.  At  a  second  moment,  the 
number  of  A_  and  aa  susceptible  vectors  decreased  and 
the  proportion  of  pure  recessives  overcame  the  propor¬ 
tion  of  the  other  genotypes.  The  number  of  pure  recessive 
infected  vectors  all  increased  over  the  time,  while  the 
quantity  of  infected  individuals  that  carry  the  dominant 
allele  had  periods  of  growth  and  decline. 


The  recessive  allele  tended  to  fixation  while  the  fre¬ 
quency  of  the  dominant  one  decreased  over  time  (Fig.  6a). 
According  to  another  simulation  with  the  same  condi¬ 
tions,  but  a  bigger  time,  fixation  occurs  when  t  =  722. 
Despite  the  beginning  of  the  simulation,  the  frequency 
of  the  genotype  aa  increased,  while  the  frequency  of  the 
others  decreased. 

Simulation  3 

The  graphs  in  Figs.  7  and  8  show  the  results  of  the 
third  simulation,  in  which  the  dominant  allele  conferred 
insecticide  resistance  a  smaller  mortality  value), 

therefore  the  resistant  strain  consists  of  AA  and  Aa  indi¬ 
viduals.  Regarding  the  human  population  (Fig.  7a),  the 
number  of  susceptible  individuals  decrease  until  reach¬ 
ing  the  value  zero,  while  the  quantity  of  recovered  grew 
during  the  whole  time  considered.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  infected  population  increased  to  a  maximal  at  day 
27  and  then  started  to  go  down.  Concerning  the  vec¬ 
tors,  the  dominant  homozygotes  and  heterozygotes  were 
more  numerous  than  the  recessive  homozygotes  through¬ 
out  the  whole  simulation  (Fig.  7b  and  c),  except  for  the 
initial  time.  As  for  the  infected  compartment  (Fig.  7b), 
the  A_  compartment  increased,  while  the  group  of  pure 
recessives  barely  varied  over  the  whole  time  considered. 
The  susceptible  vectors  (Fig.  7)  had  an  initial  period 
of  growth  followed  by  a  period  of  decrease,  and  the 
A_  susceptible  vectors  were  more  numerous  than  the 
aa  ones.  The  population  of  susceptible  vectors  grew 
until  day  11,  when  it  started  to  decrease  (Fig.  7d), 
and  then  was  eventually  overcome  by  the  infected 
population. 

Finally,  regarding  the  allelic  frequencies,  the  dominant 
allele  tended  to  fixation,  while  the  recessive  tended  to  zero 
(Fig.  8a).  In  an  attempt  to  find  when  the  allele  A  would 
fix  in  the  population,  we  did  a  similar  computational

that  confers  resistance,  the  number  of  infected  people  is 
bigger  and  the  number  of  susceptible,  smaller.  Conversely, 
when  there  are  no  resistant  strains,  the  number  of  infected 
humans  is  smaller  and  the  susceptible  compartment  is 
bigger.

Discussion 

In  this  study,  we  propose  a  SIR  model  that  considers  the 
population  genetics  of  vector  insecticide  resistance.  We 
did  three  computational  simulations:  in  one  of  them,  all 
vectors  of  the  population  had  the  same  insectide-induced 
mortality,  so  that  there  was  no  selection  and  no  resistant 
strain.  In  the  second,  the  recessive  homozygotes  vec¬ 
tors  were  resistant  to  an  insecticide,  and  therefore  they 
had  a  smaller  mortality  rate  and  a  bigger  fitness.  In  the 
third,  those  who  carried  the  dominant  allele  had  insecti¬ 
cide  resistance.  Therefore,  they  had  more  probability  of 


passing  their  genes  to  the  next  generation.  Our  model 
is  based  on  the  biology  of  several  vector-borne  diseases 
such  as  dengue  fever,  yellow  fever  and  chikungunya.  All 
of  them  are  caused  by  viruses  of  the  genus  Flavivirus  and 
are  transmitted  by  Aedes  spp.,  especially  Aedes  aegypti 
[25-27]. 

These  tropical  neglected  diseases  are  extremely  impor¬ 
tant  nowadays:  in  Brazil,  until  the  21st  epidemiological 
week  of  2016,  almost  1.3  million  people  came  down  with 
dengue  and  122762  probable  cases  of  chikungunya  were 
registered  [28];  in  one  year,  60000  people  died  because 
of  yellow  fever  in  Sub-Saharian  Africa  [29].  However,  the 
present  model  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  because 
it  disregards  important  factors,  such  as  seasonal  varia¬ 
tion  of  temperature  [19],  different  life  stages  of  the  vector 
[19,  20],  spatial  distribution  of  populations  [21]  and  the 
existence  of  various  strains  of  a  pathogen  [30].  Therefore, 
it  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  computational 
simulations  may  fail  in  accurately  representing  all  aspects 
of  a  real  epidemics.  Notwithstanding  these  restrictions, 
our  model  is  important  for  understanding  the  influence 
of  insecticide  resistance  genetics  on  dynamics  of  an  epi¬ 
demics,  without  influence  of  other  factors.  In  addition,  it 
may  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  development  of  more  complex 
and  realistic  approaches. 

In  our  model,  we  considered  a  pair  of  allelomorphs 
with  complete  dominance  interaction  and  Mendelian 
inheritance,  which  affected  the  mortality  rate  of  the 
vector.  Using  this  approach,  we  intended  to  simulate 
a  genetic-induced  insecticide  resistance.  Several  similar 
real  cases  are  described  in  the  literature.  According  to

transmembrane  protein  gene  of  Aedes  aegypti  is  linked 
to  knockdown  resistance  to  pyrethroids,  which  is  a  very 
common  type  of  insecticide.  The  allele  that  contains 
this  mutation  is  recessive  and  increased  in  frequency 
when  under  insecticide  selection  [31].  Another  interest¬ 
ing  example  is  found  in  the  study  by  Bonin  et  al.  [32],  who 
researched  some  alleles  in  Aedes  aegypti  related  to  resis¬ 
tance  to  the  bioinsecticide  Bacillus  thuringiensis  israe- 
lensis.  These  allelomorphs  have  dominant  characteristics. 
However,  the  genes  considered  in  that  study  [32]  are  poli- 
genes,  i.e.,  they  determine  a  quantitative  character,  which 
is  different  from  our  mathematical  model,  which  con¬ 
siders  that  insecticide  resistance  is  qualitative.  There  are 
many  different  mutations  of  this  kind  in  several  mosquito 
populations  around  the  world  [33]. 

Analyzing  Figs.  3d,  5d  and  7d,  it  is  clear  that  the  total 
vector  population  is  smaller  in  the  first  simulation  than  in 
the  others.  This  can  be  easily  explained  by  the  fact  that 
more  individuals  are  removed  there,  since  the  mean  mor¬ 
tality  rate  is  bigger  because  all  vectors  have  a  mortality 
value  of  0.25day-1.  In  contrast,  in  the  other  two  simu¬ 
lations,  there  is  a  portion  of  the  population  with  jiT  = 
0.01  day-1,  and  therefore  the  mean  mortality  is  smaller 
and  the  total  number  of  vectors  is  bigger. 

Another  interesting  observation  to  make  about  Figs.  3d, 
5d  and  7d  is  that  when  there  is  an  insecticide-resistant 
strain,  the  proportion  of  vectors  infected  with  the 
pathogen  is  bigger.  In  addition,  this  proportion  is  even 
bigger  when  the  resistance  is  caused  by  a  dominant  allele 
instead  of  a  recessive  one.  This  can  be  easily  seen  in 
Fig.  11.  One  possible  explanation  for  this  phenomenon  is 
that  when  there  is  a  resistant  strain,  the  mean  mortality 
rate  is  smaller,  as  stated  above  in  this  section.  Therefore, 
less  susceptible  vectors  die,  and  this  compartment  become 
more  numerous. 

According  to  the  expression  •  Sv  of  system  11, 
the  bigger  the  number  of  susceptible  vectors,  the  more 


they  become  infected  and  the  bigger  the  compartment 
of  infected  vectors.  The  larger  proportion  of  infected 
vectors  in  the  presence  of  resistance  was  also  observed 
in  laboratory  experiments  in  vivo.  For  instance,  Labout 
et  al.  [34]  studied  three  strains  of  Anopheles  gambiae ,  the 
malaria  vector:  all  of  them  had  the  same  genetic  back¬ 
ground,  despite  the  fact  that  one  group  was  susceptible 
to  insecticides,  another  had  a  mutation  that  conferred 
resistance  to  organophosphates  and  carbamates;  and  the 
third  had  a  knockdown  mutation  that  determined  resis¬ 
tance  to  pyrethroids  and  DDT.  The  mosquitoes  were  fed 
on  blood  with  Plasmodium  falciparum ;  the  protozoan  that 
causes  malaria,  and  then  the  prevalence  of  P.  falciparum 
infection  in  the  vectors  strains  was  measured.  They  found 
that  the  prevalence  was  higher  in  insecticide  resistant 
strains  than  in  the  susceptible  one.  Alout  et  al.  [34]  explain 
this  phenomenon  through  a  molecular  mechanism,  while 
our  present  paper  justify  it  through  population  dynamics. 
Probably,  during  an  epidemic,  both  mechanisms  influence 
the  proportion  of  infected  vectors. 

When  the  outputs  of  the  three  simulations  are  com¬ 
pared,  a  slight  difference  between  the  human  population 
dynamics  can  be  observed.  This  difference  is  more  visible 
when  there  are  less  individuals  (Fig.  10).  It  can  be  noted 
that  the  number  of  infected  people  is  greater  in  pres¬ 
ence  of  resistant  vectors,  and  smaller  in  their  absence.  The 
inverse  is  valid  for  susceptible  humans.  This  might  hap¬ 
pen  because  of  the  larger  proportion  of  infected  vectors 
in  simulations  2s  and  3s  and  smaller  in  simulation  Is,  in 
conformity  to  the  statements  of  the  previous  paragraph. 
The  more  vectors  are  infected,  the  faster  humans  become 
infected.  The  bigger  is  the  compartment  of  infected  peo¬ 
ple,  the  smaller  is  the  compartment  of  susceptible  people. 

Although  we  diminished  the  populations  in  the  sim¬ 
ulation  in  Fig.  10  and  it  had  interesting  results,  in  real 
situations  the  natural  selection  becomes  less  relevant  in 
small  populations,  in  which  the  genetic  drift  is  the  most

actable  evolution  factor  [15].  For  this  reason,  we  con¬ 
sidered  greater  variable  values  in  the  other  simulations, 
even  though  the  effect  in  humans  was  more  subtle.  One 
can  argue  that  the  differences  between  the  simulations  of 
Fig.  10  are  a  bias  due  to  the  small  size  of  populations. 
As  a  matter  of  fact,  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  approaches  that 
involve  small  samples  usually  face  this  issue.  However, 
our  in  silico  study  used  only  non-stochastic  mathemati¬ 
cal  tools,  so  that  the  results  are  always  exact  or  depends 
only  on  the  variables  and  parameters  considered.  In  order 
to  confirm  this,  the  computational  simulations  were  per¬ 
formed  several  times,  and  all  of  them  presented  the  same 
results.  Therefore,  the  differences  in  human  populations 
did  not  occur  because  of  the  small  population  size,  but 
because  of  the  genetics  of  the  vector  insecticide  resistance. 

Taken  together,  the  results  of  simulations  1,  2,  3,  Is, 
2s  and  3s  suggest  that  the  genetics  of  insecticide  resis¬ 
tance  have  stronger  effect  on  the  vector  population  than 
in  the  human  population.  This  result  may  be  explained 
by  the  fact  that  the  insecticide  resistance  gene  have  direct 
effect  on  the  vectors  populations,  but  only  indirectly  influ¬ 
ences  the  human  populations.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the 
insecticide  resistance  have  direct  effect  on  vector  mor¬ 
tality  rate,  which  influences  the  size  of  susceptible  and 
infected  vector  populations.  In  turn,  changes  in  vector 
infected  population  causes  changes  in  human  susceptible 
and  infected  populations,  that  are  also  restrained  by  /?/* 
and  Nh-  Indeed,  in  simulations  2,  3,  2s  and  3s,  the  differ¬ 
ences  in  genotype  frequencies  among  the  simulations  can 
be  noticed  in  the  first  days  of  simulation  (Figs.  6b,  8b), 
the  differences  in  size  of  vector  infected  populations  can 
be  seen  from  day  20  on  (Fig.  11),  while  the  differences  in 
size  of  human  infected  populations  only  can  be  noticed 
from  day  80  on  (Fig.  10b).  Overall,  this  information  show 
that  the  genetics  of  the  vectors  affects  the  epidemiological 
dynamics  of  a  vector-borne  disease  as  to  several  important 
aspects.  Therefore,  the  present  model  could  be  an  impor¬ 
tant  start  point  for  investigating  population  dynamics  in 
epidemics. 

Another  relevant  observation  is  that,  in  all  simulations 
of  our  model,  the  populations  of  susceptible  humans 
always  decreased  and  reached  zero,  and  never  went  up. 
This  happens  because  of  the  combination  of  two  factors: 
(1)  the  value  of  the  human  birth  rate  is  equal  to  the  value 
of  the  human  mortality  rate,  and  (2)  the  immunity  of 


the  recovered  was  lifelong,  so  they  would  never  become 
susceptible  again.  This  situation  could  be  reversed  by  con¬ 
sidering  different  values  of  c  and  /x/*,  but  it  was  decided  to 
use  the  same  values  for  both  parameters  in  order  to  main¬ 
tain  constant  the  size  of  total  human  population  during 
all  the  time  of  simulation.  It  was  decided  to  consider  life¬ 
long  immunity  because  this  characteristic  is  observed  for 
important  vector-borne  diseases  such  as  chikungunya  [35] 
and  for  each  dengue  serotype  [36]. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  curve  obtained  for 
infected  humans  in  all  three  computational  simulations 
has  a  very  similar  shape  to  many  line  graphs  made  with 
real  epidemiological  data.  For  example,  we  can  cite  the 
Brazilian  dengue  epidemics  in  the  years  of  2013,  2014, 
and  2015,  whose  line  graphs  for  the  number  of  infected 
people  over  time  can  be  found  in  the  epidemiological 
bulletins  of  the  Brazilian  Secretary  of  Health  Vigilance 
[28] .  In  all  of  them,  during  the  rainy  season,  the  number 
of  infected  people  increases  until  it  reaches  a  peak,  and 
then  it  starts  to  decrease,  similar  to  the  outputs  obtained 
here.  The  same  trend  is  observed  in  the  number  of  yellow 
fever  suspect  cases  in  Angola,  from  December,  2015  to 
March,  2016  [2]. 

Regarding  the  allele  frequencies,  in  all  simulations,  the 
initial  p  and  q  were  0.375  and  0.625,  respectively.  How¬ 
ever,  these  variables  changed  very  differentially  according 
to  the  simulation.  As  stated  in  the  results  of  simulation 
1,  in  the  first  simulation,  the  frequencies  did  not  change 
because  of  the  lack  of  evolutionary  factors.  Comparing 
simulations  2  and  3,  we  can  infer  that  the  resistance 
allele  fixes  faster  when  this  allele  is  recessive  than  when 
it  is  dominant:  the  time  it  takes  to  reach  the  frequency 
100%  is  longer  when  A  confers  resistance;  and  the  vari¬ 
ation  of  frequency  between  0  <  t  <  100  is  smaller 
in  the  third  simulation  (Table  5).  According  to  Freeman 
and  Herron  [15],  this  happens  because,  when  a  domi¬ 
nant  allele  is  positively  selected,  the  recessive  allele  that 
confer  a  smaller  fitness  is  maintained  through  the  het¬ 
erozygotes,  that  “hide”  the  recessive  alleles,  since  they 
carry  them  but  express  the  phenotype  of  bigger  fitness. 
When  the  recessive  allelomorph  is  positively  selected,  the 
situation  is  different:  the  heterozygotes  have  a  smaller 
fitness  despite  the  fact  they  carry  the  two  forms  of  the 
gene,  and  therefore  they  tend  to  be  eliminated  from  the 
population.

The  frequencies  of  the  genotypes  in  simulations  2  and 
3,  at  the  beginning  of  the  time  considered,  have  similar 
dynamics  to  the  first  simulation.  After  this  initial  period, 
they  start  to  vary  according  to  the  selective  pressure. 

Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  the  model  presented  in  this  work  exhib¬ 
ited  results  in  conformation  with  the  literature,  and  the 
numerical  results  show  that  the  genetics  of  the  vectors 
do  influence  human  population  dynamics.  The  compu¬ 
tational  simulations  have  shown  that  the  presence  of  an 
insecticide  resistance  gene  is  related  to  a  bigger  number  of 
infected  humans  and  vectors.  The  numerical  investigation 
has  also  shown  that  this  aspect  depends  on  the  inheritance 
pattern  of  the  gene,  since  a  dominant  insecticide  resis¬ 
tance  gene  implies  in  an  even  greater  number  of  infected 
people  and  vectors. 

This  study  does  not  consider  factors  such  as  differ¬ 
ent  life  stages  of  vectors  and  the  possibility  of  diverse 
serotypes  of  a  pathogen.  Notwithstanding  these  restric¬ 
tions,  our  model  could  be  a  basis  for  the  development  of 
more  sophisticated  epidemiological  models  that  consid¬ 
ers  insecticide  resistance  genetics.  These,  in  turn,  could 
be  used  for  monitoring  diseases  such  as  yellow  fever  and 
predicting  trends  of  epidemics.  This  way,  the  present 
investigation  open  new  perspectives  for  further  studies. 
For  example,  our  model  could  be  a  starting  point  to  cal¬ 
culate  the  optimum  control  in  which  insecticides  are  used 
in  a  manner  that  minimizes  the  evolution  of  resistance  in 
vector  population.
