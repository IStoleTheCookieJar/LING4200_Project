INTRODUCTION 


American  lawn  tennis  players  during  the  season  of  1905  developed 
a  marked  tendency  toward  returning  to  the  safe  methods  of  the  Britons. 
This  notwithstanding  the  remarkable  achievements  of  the  players  of 
this  country  along  the  lines  of  scientific  and  strategic  play  of  a  sport 
that  is  essentially  English.  Ever  since  the  Doherty  brothers  captured 
the  Davis  International  Challenge  Cup,  the  blue  ribbon  of  the  lawn 
tennis  courts.  American  experts  have  appreciated  their  own  shortcom- 
ings and  faults.  Gradually  changes  have  been  effected,  and  last  sea- 
son's play  revealed  the  changes,  scoffed  at  in  the  beginning  but  later 
realized  as  the  real  foundation  upon  which  the  future  of  the  play  in 
this   country   will   be   built. 

The  most  remarkable  departure  was  the  practical  abandonment  of 
the  net  game,  so  ably  upheld  by  the  redoubtable  Bob  Wrenn  and  the 
national  champions  immediately  following  him.  It  hazarded  all  upon 
a  single  stroke.  Against  players  also  striving  for  a  risky,  over- 
whelming play  it  was  effective.  The  Englishmen,  however,  showed  its 
weaknesses  by  their  painstaking  steadiness  and  in  refusing  to  be  drawn 
so  close  to  the  net  that  the  possibility  of  a  return  was  lost  even 
when  the  opposing  player's  great  stroke  came  off  brilliantly.  While 
the  Englishmen  did  not  shirk  an  exchange  at  the  net  when  it  was 
forced  upon  them,  they  at  all  times  favored  the  deep  court.  In  this 
respect  the  Americans  have  somewhat  improved  upon  their  method. 
During  the  past  season  they  developed  a  game  of  prettily  graduated 
balance  between  the  furious  and  strenuous  net  play  and  the  old-fash- 
ioned base-line  driving  which  gives  promise  of  revolutionizing  the  play 
in  this  country. 

Tlie  most  surprising  thing  about  this  change  in  American  tactics 
was  that  it  brought  several  of  those  who  had  previously  been  regarded 
as  base-line  players  to  the  fore,  the  most  notable  being  Richard 
Stevens.  So  thoroughly  were  the  merits  of  the  long-driving  game  ap- 
preciated that  after  Beals  C.  Wright's  masterful  victory  at  Newport, 
in  which  he  vanquished  Holcombe  Ward  in  the  challenge  match  for 
national  honors,  there  was  a  general  acceptance  of  the  mid-court  game, 
and  the  autumn  tournaments  brought  out  some  of  the  best  racket 
work  ever  seen  upon  the  courts  here.  The  winners  of  these  meetings 
were  easily  the  equal  of  the  Britons  for  steadiness,  and  that  is  one  of 
the  elements  necessary  to  the  successful  playing  of  the  mid-court  game. 
Only  in  the  driving  were  the  Americans  slightly  inferior  to  the  Britons, 
but  this  is  a  defect  that  may  be  expected  to  disappear  altogether  with 
another  season. 

The  American  challenging  team  for  the  Davis  trophy  last  season — 
Holcombe  Ward,  at  the  time  the  holder  of  the  National  championship  ; 
William  A.  Larned.  former  National  chamoion  ;  William  J.  Clothier, 
a  former  Swarthmore  and  Harvard  plaver  ;  and  the  partner  of  Ward 
in  the  holding  of  the  National  doubles,  Beals  C.  Wright — only  missed 
bringing  it  back  by  the  narrowest  of  margins.  Their  conquest  upon 
the  English  courts  almost  ranks  in  point  of  interest  with  the  changes 
which  the  American  players  wrought  at  home.  Wright  consistentlv 
played  the  mid-court  game  and.  while  he  was  fairly  successful,  he  had 
not   so  perfectly   developed   its   finer  points    in    July,    when   he   played 


6  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

at  Wimbledon,  as  he  displayed  them  five  or  six  weeks  later  when  he 
won  at  Newport.  Yet  the  performances  of  the  American  team  abroad 
were  in  every  way  remarkable.  They  met  and  rather  easily  defeated 
the  best  that  the  lawn  tennis  courts  of  France,  Belgium,  Austria  and 
Australia  could  send  to  the  preliminary  tournament.  It  was  the  amaz- 
ing steadiness  of  the  Doherty  brothers  and  Frank  L.  Riseley  that  in 
the  critical  periods  of  the  games  helped  the  Britons  through  the  tight 
places  in  the  final  challenge  matches  and  saved  the  coveted  trophy  for 
them  for  another  year. 

Whether  the  new  order  of  things  will  cause  the  abandonment  of 
Newport  as  the  place  for  holding  the  National  championship  is  prob- 
lematical. The  veteran  Larned.  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee 
of  the  Ignited  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  sounded  the 
note  of  warning  last  August  when  he  complained  that  Newport  and  the 
life  of  that  ultra-fashionable  colony  failed  to  serve  the  best  interests  of 
the  sport.  That  the  exorbitant  cost  of  living  makes  it  impossible  for 
many  of  the  really  high-class  players  to  participate  in  the  greatest  of 
the  tournaments  in  this  country,  was  the  burden  of  Larned's  com- 
plaint. He  pointed  out  that  the  majority  of  the  players  left  Newport 
as  soon  as  they  were  defeated  in  the  tournament  because  of  the  ex- 
pense of  accommodations,  so  that  the  valuable  experiences  of  play 
among  high-class  men  were  lost  altogether,  and  the  consolations, 
which  might  prove  of  immense  advantage,  became  a  farce. 

That  the  past  season  manifested  the  increased  interest  in  lawn  ten- 
nis in  this  country  was  readily  -'auged  by  the  Newport  entry  list  of 
105  competitors,  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  sport  that  the 
number  liad  topped  one  hundred.  The  early  indoor  tournaments  in- 
augurated by  Mrs.  Barger  Wallach,  assisted  by  Mrs.  John  Jacob  Astor 
and  Miss  Maud  Wetmore,  in  the  St.  Nicholas  Rink  in  New  York,  af- 
forded good  sport  and  also  revealed  the  widening  influence  of  the 
game.  When  later  in  the  season  Mrs.  Barger  Wallach  proved  the 
leading  factor  in  promoting  lawn  tennis  among  the  fashionable  set  at 
Newport,  the  game  was  diligently  played  upon  the  Casino  courts  be- 
fore and  after  the  National  meeting.  Another  season  at  the  St.  Nich- 
olas is  in  prospect  and  with  it  the  hopes  of  witnessing  the  play  of 
Miss  May  Sutton,  the  California  girl.  It  was  this  young  girl  who 
created  such  havoc  upon  the  English  courts  last  season,  her  greatest 
achievement  being  the  winning  of  the  All-England  championship.  With 
this  victory,  even  lauded  by  lyrics  in  the  English  music  halls.  Miss 
Sutton  rather  overdid  herself  abroad,  and  the  Englishwomen  were  not 
sorry  to  see  her  sail  for  home,  leaving  them  a  few  titles.  The  Cali- 
fornia girl  and  her  two  sisters  have  planned  a  tour  of  the  American 
tournaments  for  the  coming  year,  and  with  the  work  so  well  begun  by 
Mrs.  Barger  Wallach  last  season  they  will  do  much  toward  attracting 
a  following  of  American  women  to  the  game  such  as  it  enjoys  abroad 
among  the  women  of  England  and  France. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 


The  victory  of  Beals  C.  Wright  over  Holcomhe  Ward  for  the  Amer- 
ican championship  is  a  fitting  climax  to  the  career  of  one  of  the 
most  earnest,  painstaking,  careful  players  the  American  game  has  ever 
produced.  Coming  on  top  of  a  season  in  which  he  consistently  played 
the  best  tennis  of  any  man  competing  in  the  various  tournaments  in 
which  he  appeared,  iny  otlier  result  would  have  been  most  unfor- 
tunate. Viewed  in  the  light  of  success,  how  odd  appears  the  agitation 
in  some  quarters  early  in  the  year  t:  omi^-  him  from  the  International 
team  and  how  strong  a  rebuke  it  is  upon  the  judgment  displayed  by 
the  American  tennis  exponent  in  general  who  defers  to  past  achieve- 
ment rather  than  to  present  form.  What  would  have  been  the  result 
in  the  international  tournament  if  he  had  been  given  a  chance  to 
play  in  the  singles,  instead  of  men  who  had  reputations,  but  were 
markedly  off  their  game,  when  he  was  certainly  playing  tennis  far 
superior  to  that  of  any  of  the  other  tliree  men? 

At  Newport  he  won  his  spurs  in  a  manner  that  must  awaken  the 
admiration  of  every  lover  of  the  game  throughout  the  country.  His 
steadiness  was  equal  to  that  of  the  great  Doherty,  and  his  brilliancy 
when  called  into  nlay,  as  great  as  Larned's.  lie  played  sterling  tennis 
of  the  highest  class  throughout.  Meeting  Clothier,  Larned,  Hobart 
and  W'ardin  succession  and  defeating  them  all  in  clean  cut,  convincing 
style,  could  more  be  asked  to  prove  the  mettle  of  any  man?  Fie  lost 
one  set  in  the  tournament — to  Larned — and  this,  the  first  of  the  series, 
he  followed  by  three  easy  wins.  Clothier,  in  the  first  set,  gave  him 
a  hard  battle  "for  another,  and  Ward  in  the  final  set,  made  a  fearful 
fight  for  a  win.  In  this  W^right  played  magnificently  and  even  Ward's 
fine  sensational  rally  only  served  to  delay  the  moment  when  Wright's 
greater  steadiness  would  win. 

Coupled  with  this  he  played  with  Ward  in  the  challenge  round  of 
the  doubles  and  they  toyed  with  Hackett  and  Alexander,  who  had  pre- 
viously won  the  right  to  compete  for  the  championship  in  a  match 
with  Collins  and  Waidner,  the  Western  champions,  In  these  games 
Wright  played  by  far  the  best  tennis  of  the  four  men  on  the  field. 
The  champion  pair  were  not  forced  to  exert  themselves,  but  they  had 
some  opportunity  for  brilliancy,  and  it  was  almost  invariably  Wright 
who  shone. 

The  Newport  tournament  brought  out  a  record  entry,  105  starters. 
The  first  round  occupied  a  solid  day.  The  doubles  were  played  off  at 
once,  w^hile  the  singles  continued  through  three  rounds  with  small  in- 
terest attaching  to  them. 

The  first  three  rounds  gradually  eliminated  the  weaker  players,  the 
first  contest  of  importance  coming  in  the  fourth.  Here  Ray  Little, 
Harry  Allen  and  Louis  Waidner  went  down  to  defeat.  R.  N.  Dana 
also  made  his  exit,  after  putting  up  a  surprisingly  good  game  against 
Clarence  Hobart,  and  having  a  chance  to  retire  him.  Two  sets  had 
been  won  by  Hobart,  when  he  slumped,  and  Dana,  by  the  cleverest 
kind  of  a  rally,  took  the  third  and  then  the  fourth  sets.  In  the 
fourth  Hobart  began  to  find  himself  again,  and  he  had  entirely  re- 
covered form  and  won  easily  in  the  final  set. 

Outside  of  this  the  Clothier-Waidner  gan:e  ^as  the  most  interesting. 
It  looked  at  one  time  as  though  the  international  player  would  go  out. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  9 

Waidner  won  the  first  two  sets,  playing  superbly,  but  tired  in  the 
third,  and  although  he  made  a  game  fight,  lost  the  last  three,  ITie 
scores  were  7/9,  4/6,  6/2,  6/4,  6/4. 

In  defeating  Ray  Little,  Larned  had  some  trouble  that  at  one  time 
looked  dangerous  to  him.  Little  lost  the  first  two  sets,  scarcely  cost- 
ing the  champion  an  effort,  but  in  the  third  the  men  showed  a  com- 
plete reversal  of  form,  and  Little  won  almost  as  handily.  The  fourth 
and  deciding  set  was  terrifically  hard  fought,  and  several  times  Little 
looked  to  be  the  winner,  but  Larned  finally  got  his  measure  and  he 
went  down,   7/5. 

Wright  had  no  trouble  at  all  with  Allen,  who,  in  winning  four 
games  in  the  final  set,  merely  took  advantage  of  a  let-up  on  Wright's 
Vart.     Tlie  scores  were  6/2,  6/0,  6/4. 

This  brought  together  important  players  in  two  more  matches  in  the 
/ifth  round.  Collins  and  Larned  were  conceded  winners  over  Jones 
and  Behr,  but  there  was  keen  interest  in  the  meeting  of  Stevens  and 
Hobart  and  in  the  match  between  Wright  and  Clothier.  Stevens 
started  out  well  and  took  the  opening  set,  but  Hobart  then  played 
everything  safe  and  watched  carefully  for  his  opening.  When  it  came 
he  played  with  swiftness  and  sureness,  surpassing  Stevens  at  his  own 
game.  These  won  the  second  set  6/4,  the  third  set  6/2,  and  the 
fourth  6/4. 

Clothier  gave  Wright  an  awful  battle  for  the  first  set,  and  after 
having  it  seemingly  won,  lost  through-  the  Bostonian's  wonderful  rally. 
The  second  and  third  sets  were  Wright's  easily,  his  game  improving 
markedly  as  he  progressed,  and  Clothier  seeming  to  have  spent  his 
bolt.  ISevertheless  both  were  interesting.  It  took  sixteen  games  to 
decide  the  first.  Wright  won  the  first,  but  Clothier's  reach  and  ability 
to  cover  court  gave  him  three  in  succession.  AVright  then  had  re- 
course to  placing  the  ball  on  Clothier's  left  hand  and  low,  and  his 
deadly  accuracy  brought  the  Philadelphian  to  the  net.  Wright  evened 
the  score  at  3-all,  but  Clothier  took  the  next  two  by  superior  volley- 
ing. Wright  lobbed  and  drove  him  from  the  net  again,  evening  the 
score  at  5-all,  when  Clothier  seemingly  had  the  set  in  hand.  They 
interchanged  services,  Wright  always  in  the  lead,  until  in  the  six- 
teenth game,  Wright  broke  through  and  won  easily.  T'he  point  score 
on  the  three  sets  showed  ;

With  Hobart  and  Collins  matched  in  the  semi-final,  and  W'right  and 
Larned,  there  was  bound  to  be  stellar  tennis.  Hobart  was  favored 
over  Collins,  because  the  Westerner  seemed  spent,  having  had  trouble 
defeating  Jones.  Wright  was  favored  over  Larned  for  the  double  rea- 
son that  he  had  been  steadily  playing  fine  tennis  while  Larned  had  been 
erratic,  and  because  he  could  be  depended  on  to  do  his  best  in  a  pinch, 
while  Larned  could  not.     And  so  it  turned  out. 

Lamed  took  the  first  set  by  some  sensational  play,  appearing  at  his 
best.  He  took  the  first,  second,  fifth,  sixth,  and  eighth  games,  bringing 
the  score  5/3.  AA'right  took  the  next,  but  could  not  stave  off  the  de- 
leat.  Each  won  his  own  service  in  the  second  set,  then  each  broke 
through  again,  coming  even.  Then  Wright  forged  ahead  with  two 
games,  and  after  dropping  the  seventh  game,  went  on  and  won    6/4.

Larned  lost  his  second  service  in  the  third  set,  and  gave  Wright  the 
lead  at  the  end  of  six  games.  4/2.  Again  he  broke  through  and  then 
won  on  his  own  serve,  6/2.  The  fourth  set  was  a  practical  repetition 
of  the  third,  Larned  making  only  the  semblance  of  a  fight.  The  points 
fell  thus  :

Collins  gave  Hobart  a  much  harder  fight.  He  took  the  first  game,  6/4, 
and  lost  the  second  by  the  same  score,  although  he  missed  two  chances 
to  win  it  by  hard  luck.  The  third  set  required  sixteen  games  to  decide, 
Collins  winning  out  finally  by  the  pluckiest  kind  of  clever  play.  But 
Hobart  came  back  strong,  though  Collins  fought  hard  and  gained 
the  lead  only  to  lose  out  on  Hobarfs  fine  rallies.  In  the  final  set  the 
Westerner  appeared  worn  and  Hobart  won  by  his  superior  strength  and 
more  seasoned  headwork. 

The  meeting  of  Wright  and  Hcbart  in  the  finals  developed  splendid 
play.  Just  a  shade  below  his  form  against  Larned,  Wright  still  played 
magnificently.  His  headiness  in  the  first  and  second  set,  combined  with 
his  skillful  placing  and  his  steadiness,  won  certain  victories.  In  the 
first,  however,  Hobart  ga  -e  him  quite  a  run  for  honors.  In  the  third 
set,  both  men  cut  loose  and  played  the  game  to  the  limit  of  their 
ability.  Wright  was  all  over  the  court  from  baseline  to  net  and  chang- 
ing pace  with  telling  precision.  Hobart  was  way  beyond  any  form  he 
showed  in  rny  game  in  the  tournament,  throwing  caution  to  the  winds 
and  depending  on  reckless  brilliancy  that  was  consistently  accurate 
notwithstanding  to  win.  The  rallies  were  splendid  to  watch,  but  Wright 
steadily  forged  ahead,  always  holding  the  upper  hand,  and  won  6/3. 
The  point  scored  only  partially  tells  the  closeness  and  the  cleverness  of 
the  exhibition  of  both  men.     It  follows  :

In  the  championship  match,  Wright  was  favored  over  Ward,  on  ac- 
count of  the  consistently  high  class  game  he  has  played  all  year,  espe- 
cially abroad.  In  the  tournament  his  work  was  distinctly  on  champion- 
ship calibre.  Ward,  on  the  other  hand,  had  played  erratically  before 
he  went  abroad,  during  his  foreign  trip,  and  after  his  return.  To  be 
sure  the  fact  that  Wright  had  had  so  hard  a  struggle  to  reach  the 
finals,  particularly  in  the  closing  days,  would  militate  against  him,  but 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL,  1] 

Ward's  lack  of  tournament  play  ought  as  well  to  tell  against  him.  In 
a  measure  the  two  considerations  neutralized  each  other. 

But  few  expected  that  the  Boston  man  would  so  markedly  outplay 
the  champion.  Until  the  third  set  was  in  hand  Ward  never  had  a 
look  in.  Then  it  was  only  by  one  of  his  sensational  rallies  for  which 
he  is  famous  that  the  little  champion  made  a  hard  fight,  only  tc  suc- 
cumb at  the  finish.  With  games  four  to  two  against  him  it  looked  to 
be  all  over.  When  each  added  a  game,  and  Wright  needed  but  one 
game  more  there  was  little  doubt  about  it,  but  Ward  not  only  won  two 
games,  but  added  a  third  getting  advantage,  Wright  saved  the  next, 
and  the  match  drifted  to  deuce  to  Ward's  advantage,  and  back  until 
the  nineteenth  game,  when  Wright  won  advantage,  and  followed  ic  up 
by  taking  game,  set  and  match. 

It  was  a  sensational  finish  and  called  forth  terms  worthy  of  the 
championship.     The  point  score  was  :

At  the  start  of  tne  tournament  the  doubles  aroused  keener  interest 
than  the  singles.  In  the  latter,  in  the  earlier  rounds,  there  were  no 
upsets,  and  every  match  being  decided  according  to  form,  there  was 
nothing  to  hold  attention.  W'hen  on  Monday  the  Eastern  and  Western 
champions  faced  each  other,  theie  was  a  general  movement  of  the 
gallery  to  the  court  on  which  they  played.  The  Western  pair  being  the 
older  combination,  and  having  some  reputation  for  high  class  skill  was 
generally  the  favorite.  Ttiere  was  no  great  alarm  among  their  support- 
ers, even  when  they  lost  the  first  set,  6/4.  The  game  had  been  close 
enough  to  turn  on  one  or  two  critical  pliiys,  and  it  was  generally  be- 
lieved that  the  visitors  would  rally  and  come  into  their  own  in  the 
remaining  sets.  When  in  even  closer  play  the  second  set  went  to  Alex- 
ander and  Hackett.  there  was  deep  concern  in  the  Collins-Waidner  camp, 
a  concern  that  changed  to  dismay  when  the  Easterners  broke  through 
their  opponents'  service  in  the  seventh  game  and  made  the  score  5/3. 
It  was  too  late  then  to  retrieve  their  fortunes,  and  Collins  and  Waidner 
went  down  to  defeat  for  the  third  time  by  the  6/4  score.  The  points 
were  made  at  the  three  sets  thus  : 

First  Set. 

Alexander    and    Hackett 434352404     8—37—6 

Collins    and    Waidner 2     5     1     5     3     4    2     4     1     6 — 33 — 4

Collins    and    Waidner., 556454111     6 — 13 — 4 


This  brought  Alexander  and  Hackett  up  to  the  challenge  round, 
t  none  expected  to  see  them  make  much  of  a  fight  against  Ward  and 
right.     Nor  did  they.      The  six  games  that  fell  to   their   lot   in  the

match  were  due,  after  the  first  rather  to  the  carelessness  on  the  part 
of  the  champions  than  to  the  superior  quality  of  the  challengers'  play.

Annual  Meeting  of  the  U.S.N.L.T.A. 

As  in  the  previous  annual  meeting,  this  year's  session  was  marked 
by  the  momentous  question  of  sending  a  team  abroad  for  the  Dwight 
F.  Davis  trophy.  This  was  the  vote  of  the  delegates  at  the  twenty- 
fifth  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Asso- 
ciation, held  at  the  Waldorf-Astoria  on  February  5.  The  details  were 
left  to  the  executive  committee  and  a  sub-committee  which  subse- 
quently decided  to  again  challenge  England.  The  powers  of  the  ex- 
ecutive committee  were  also  enlarged,  and  the  list  of  invitation  tourna- 
ment? curtailed. 

The  roll  call  showed  100  clubs  as  members  of  the  association,  and 
of  this  number  forty-six  were  present.  T"his  indicated  a  fair  growth 
during  the  year.  In  the  report  of  Secretary  Palmer  Fresbrey  the  fact 
was  developed  that  the  interest  in  the  sport  had  greatly  increased, 
and  that  the  game  had  spread  throughout  the  country. 

Dr.  James  Dwight  of  Boston  was  re-elected  president  for  the  sixteenth 
consecutive  year  ;  Robert  D.  W^renn  re-elected  vice-president ;  Richard 
Stevens,   treasurer,    and    Palmer   E.    Fresbrey,   secretary. 

There  were  interesting  figures  in  the  report  of  Treasurer  Richard 
Stevens.  The  expenses  of  the  international  team  were  $2,025,  of 
which  half  was  borne  by  the  English  Lawn  Tennis  Association.  In 
all  there  was  a  slight  deficit  in,  the  receipts  of  the  year.

THE  INTERNATIONAL 
TOURNAMENT 


The  Dwight  F.  Davis  International  Trophy  remains  in  England.  The 
superior  steadiness  of  the  English  player  triumphed  over  greater  Ameri- 
can brilliancy.  Our  showing  was  not  so  good  as  the  followers  of  the 
game  on  this  side  of  the  water  had  reason  to  expect.  Though  game 
fights  were  made  for  several  matches  and  at  least  three  times  we  had 
a  bully  chance  to  win  we  wore  beaten  out  by  failures  at  critical  times 
to  come  up  to  the  mark.  Larned  failed  miserably  against  Smith,  and 
after  the  cup  was  lost.  Clothier,  who  was  substituted  for  \yard,  fell 
an  easy  victim  before  the  second  English  string.  Both  these  matches 
we  counted  on  winning,  and  should  have  won.  with  Ward  and  Larned 
at  the  top  of  their  game.  Had  we  won  them  we  might  have  been  well 
satisfied  with  our  record  in  losing  the  other  three  matches  against  the 
wonderful  Dohertys  by  the  close  scores  by  which  we  wore  beaten.  There 
is  nothing  now  to  do  bat  wait  another  yeai*.  send  over  another  team, 
and  try  again. 

Looking  back  it  appears  as  though  the  men  attempted  too  much  on 
the  other  side.  They  were  ofif  their  game  when  they  started  play  in 
the  International,  and  the  fact  that  they  got  through  the  preliminaries 
without  the  loss  of  a  match  is  little  consolation.  The  opposing  players, 
barring  Brookes,  were  of  no  class. 

The  default  of  Belgium  brought  the  Americans  against  France  in  the 
opening  tie.  The  selections  of  players  resulted  in  the  choice  of  Hol- 
combeW^ard  and  William  J.  Clothier  for  the  singles  against  MM. 
Decougis  and  Germot,  and  of  Holcombe  Ward  and  Beals  C.  W^right  in 
the  doubles  against  the  two  French  players.  The  draw  for  the  first  day 
brought  Ward  against  Germot  and  Clothier  against  Decougis. 

While  the  conditions  of  play  were  all  that  could  be  desired,  neither 
of  the  American  players  showed  anything  like  the  tennis  they  are 
capable  of  playing.  Fortunately  they  did  not  have  to  display  top  form 
to  win,  and  were  able  to  carry  off  the  two  matches  in  straight  sets 
without  ever  being  in  danger,  although  both  players  missed  several  com- 
paratively easy  chances. 

Ward's  sei-vice  was  so  puzzling  to  Germot  that  he  had  the  French- 
man off  his  game  continually.  Never  did  his  opponent  successfully  solve 
the  twist  imparted  to  the  ball  by  the  American,  and  it  was  always 
.safe  to  count  on  aces  when  it  came  our  turn  to  serve.  Had  it  not  been 
for  this  there  might  have  been  trouble  for  the  American  champion.  At 
times  his  short  passing  stroke  got  the  ball  past  Germot  with  brilliancy  ; 
but  for  consistency,  aside  from  service,  the  Frenchman  did  rather  the 
better  work. 

Ward  worked  up  the  court  very  effectually  and  was  close  to  the  net 
most  of  the  time.  On  the  contrary,  M.  Germot  was  kept  at  the  base 
line  pretty  consistently.  Twice  during  the  match  he  was  able  to  reach 
the  net  and  show  some  strength,  but  his  rallies  were  short  and  only 
four  times  in  the  first  two  sets  were  deuce  games  played. 

The  first  set  went  to  Ward  by  a  score  of  6/2.  Each  man  scored  on 
his  own  service,  and  Ward  on  his  third.  In  the  sixth  game  W^ard 
volleyed  effectively,  and  Germot  scored  a  double  fault  that  lost  all 
chance  for  a  rally.  The  seventh  went  to  the  American,  and  the  eighth 
he  won  brilliantly  bv  a  clever  backhand  stroke. 

The  second  set  was  a  repetition  of  the  first,  save  that  three  services

Ex-Champion  of  America 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  27 

were  interchanged  before  Ward's  volleying  turned  the  tide  his  way. 
In  the  final  set  the  American  showed  something  of  his  true  form  and 
by  wonderful  cross-court  work  and  accurate  placing  took  the  set  6/1. 

Clothier  had  a  somewhat  harder  time  against  Decougis.  The  better 
of  the  French  pair,  Decougis  in  the  first  two  sets  made  the  score  two 
all,  three  all,  four  all.  but  lost  the  ninth  game  at  love  each  time.  He 
then  seemed  to  lose  heart,  and  the  tenth  game  was  easy  for  Clothier 
both  times. 

In  the  deciding  set,  Clothier  seemed  to  gain  confidence  as  Decougis 
lost  mastery  of  his  stroke.  With  the  score  three  all.  Clothier  worked 
him  for  a  double  out,  which  he  followed  by  missing  an  easy  chance, 
and  the  American  won  the  sixth  game  he  needed  without  an  effort. 

When  Ward  and  Wright  faced  the  Frenchmen  in  the  doubles  they 
were  even  more  at  sea  than  when  playing  singly.  Ward's  break  service 
still  puzzled  them,  and  interchanged  with  Wright's  fast  straight  serves 
found  them  worse  off.  Wright  played  brilliantly,  far  better  than  Ward, 
and  the  wonder  is  that  their  opponents  were  able  to  win  the  two 
games  they  did  score  in  eacli  set.  Besides  having  an  immense  advan- 
tage in  the  disconcerted  work  of  the  French  pair  against  their  service, 
they  varied  their  pace  with  splendid  judgment,  changing  from  volley 
to  lob  and  back  with  puzzling  frequency.  As  the  match  progressed, 
instead  of  gauging  their  play  better,  the  Frencli  pair  did  rather  poorer 
work  and  their  defeat  was  apparent  in  their  half-hearted  effort  when 
the  match  was  half  over. 

Having  won  the  tie,  there  was  little  interest  displayed  on  either  side 
in  the  outcome  of  the  third  day's  play.  Germot  won  the  second  set 
from  Clothier,  the  two  making  a  very  liard  fight  for  it.  Every  game 
but  three  were  deuce  games  and  several  went  to  deuce  two  and  three 
times.  Germot  finally  won  7/5  through  a  bit  of  good  placing  along 
the  side  line,  each  time  from  a  difficult  position  by  excellent  backhand 
strokes. 

Meantime  Australia  was  having  about  as  easy  a  time  with  Austria. 
N.  E.  Brookes  outplayed  Kinzl  decidedly,  winning  two  sets  and  losing 
but  a  single  game  before  he  let  up  a  bit.  Kinzl  then  took  two  games 
straiglit  in  the  third  set.  This  seemed  to  awaken  the  Australian,  for 
he  took  the  next  six  games  and  the  match  witliout  an  effort. 

C.  von  Wessely  got  the  start  of  A.  P.  Wilding  by  a  streak  of  bril- 
liancy after  the  colonial  player  had  the  games  4/1  in  the  first  set. 
He  took  game  after  game  without  allowing  the  Antipodean  a  breathing 
spell.  The  second  set  reversed  the  order,  but  the  Austrian  again  struck 
his  pace  in  the  third  and  made  a  game  figlit  for  the  set.  It  was  five 
gam?s  all  before  he  weakened  again  and  t)efore  lie  regained  his  poise 
he  lost  the  set  and  five  games  of  another.  His  rally  then  was  a  bril- 
liant display,  but  lie  lost  an  ace  on  a  ball  that  struck  just  outside 
in  the  next  game  and  scored  a  double  out  following  that  cost  him  the 
game  and  the  match. 

On  the  second  day  the  A  istrians  did  better  in  the  doubles.  In  the 
first  set  games  were  interchanged,  each  side  winning  its  own  service 
to  the  tenth  game.  With  the  score  5-all  the  Australians  won  their 
opponents'  service  through  Brookes'  brilliancy,  but  the  Austrians  re- 
turned the  compliment,  and  it  was  6-aIl.  Austria  won  the  advantage, 
but  Australia  evened  it  at  7-all,  then  took  the  vantage  game  and  then 
the  set  by  virtue  of  Brookes'  fine  play  at  the  net. 

Austria  made  a  lame  effort  for  the  second  set,  but  put  up  a  game 
fight  for  the  third,  coming  within  an  ace  of  winning  the  vantage  game 
with  the  score  r)-all.  A  bit  of  hard  luck  cost  them  the  next  game,  the 
set  and  the  match. 

Like  the  American-French  series,  there  was  nothing  to  the  third  day. 
Brookes  again  played  brilliantly  and  won  easily,  wliile  Kinzl  made  a 
good  fight^  for  the  first  two  sets  against  Wilding.  Then  he  lost  his 
speed  and  the  match  in  short  order. 


28  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Judged  by  the  showing  of  the  four  teams  in  these  first  ties,  it  ap- 
peared that  Austria  was  the  wealicst  of  the  four,  and  that  while 
Wilding  was  of  mediocre  strength  on  the  Australian  team,  Brookes' 
brilliancy  gave  them  a  chance  to  at  least  score  against  the  Americans, 
though  there  appeared  small  possibility  of  a  win.  This  is  how  it 
worked  out.  .  ,  „,  .   ,  ^  .,  .     ,  . 

Brookes  played  brilliant  tennis  and  Wright  was  quite  up  to  his  stan- 
dard. The  contest  between  the  two  was  the  best  of  the  tournament, 
even  including  the  final  title  round.  Wright's  play  was  of  the  highest 
order,  but  that  victory  rested  with  him  at  the  end.  was  as  muich  due 
to  his  great  headwork  as  to  any  other  fact.  In  America  he  has  fre- 
quently shown  great  work  at  forehand  off  ground  strokes  and  volleying, 
but  he  had  never  shown  such  backhand  play  before,  while  his  overhead 
strokes  were  amazing  in  their  force  and  accuracy. 

He  determined  at  the  start  to  keep  Brookes  in  the  back  court.  He 
drove  at  his  feet  at  his  backhand  and  close  to  his  body  and  never  ap- 
peared to  miss  his  aim.  On  not  more  than  five  occasions  during  the 
match  did  the  Australian  succeed  in  reaching  the  net,  but  when  he  did 
he  was  splendid.  When  Wright  lobbed  Brookes'  overhead  work  proved 
weak,  and  Wright  never  allowed  him  to  remain  at  the  net  long. 

Brookes  took  the  lead  at  the  start  and  had  the  games  5/4  in  the 
first  set,  but  Wright  tied  and  took  the  vantage  game,  but  could  not 
prevent  Brookes  winning  his  service.  With  the  score  10-all  Wright  won 
the  vantage  and  then  broke  through  and  took  game  and  set. 

Again  in  the  second  Brookes  led  at  5/4  and  Wright  made  it  games- 
all,  but  the  Australian  was  not  to  be  denied  this  time,  and  won  van- 
tage and  the  following  game,  getting  the  set.  The  trial  proved  too 
much  for  the  Australian,  however,  while  Wright's  staying  power  stood 
him  in  good  stead.  He  interchanged  games  with  his  opponent,  scoring 
the  odd  until  the  ninth.  Then  Brookes  missed  his  chance  to  even  it 
up  and  the  set  went  to  the  American.  The  next  and  the  matck  was 
won  by  Wright. 

Meantime  Larned  had  no  trouble  in  winning  in  straight  sets  from 
Wilding  and  Brookes  was  not  strong  enough  to  carry  Dunlop  along  in 
the  doubles  to  victory  over  Ward  and  Wright.  They  made  a  good  fight 
in  the  second  set,  but  lost  5/7.  In  the  third  set  they  won  7/5,  but 
the  Americans  came  into  their  own  again  in  the  fourth  and  won  match 
and  tie  handily. 

Wright  and  Wilding  agreed  to  decide  their  match  in  three  sets  and 
Wright  won  the  first  two  easily.  Again  Brookes  played  brilliant  tennis 
against  Larned,  and  it  took  all  the  ex-champion's  skill  to  overcome  him. 

The  first  set  took  even  longer  than  the  long  set  with  Wright.  It  was 
give  and  take  until  the  games  stood  12-all.  In  the  sixteenth  game  it 
looked  like  a  win  for  Brookes  since  he  had  the  vantage  game  and  led 
30-love,  but  Larned  saved  himself  finally.  In  the  twenty-fifth  game 
Larned  broke  through  and  won  Brookes'  serve.  He  had  no  trouble  in 
winning  his  own  and  the  set  14/12. 

The  next  two  sets  he  won  handily,  the  strain  on  Brookes  telling 
then.  The  second  was  a  love  set,  and  the  next  might  as  well  have 
been  for  all  the  effective  resistance  Brookes  made.  However,  his  stand 
was  by  long  odds  the  feature  of  the  entire  touraament,  and  none  can 
claim  higher  honors. 

America  thus  came  up  to  the  title  round  after  having  a  terrifically 
hard  struggle  in  the  final  tie.  Ward  had  had  particularly  hard  work 
and  was  far  from  himself  in  several  of  the  games.  Larned  at  times, 
as  in  the  game  with  Brookes,  played  brilliantly,  but  his  old  tendency 
to  tail  off  at  critical  stages  was  still  in  evidence.  It  was  a  matter  of 
doubt  m  the  minds  of  many  whether  the  extraordinarily  good  showing 
made  by  Wright  in  the  early  stages  of  play,  as  well  as  in  the  games 
preceding  the  international  play,  did  not  entitle  him  to  consideration 
in  the  singles  above  one  or  the  other  of  the  men  chosen,  but  so  radical 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  21 

a  step  could  hardly  have  been  taken,  all  things  considered.  In  the 
doubles,  Ward  and  Wright  were  playing  well,  but  Ward  was  not  up  to 
his  standard,  and  there  was  really  little  expectation  of  victory  when 
the  title  play  came. 

Instead  of  Risely  going  in  with  H.  L.  Doherty  in  the  singles.  Smith 
was  chosen,  as  his  play  in  preliminary  tournaments  well  merited.  The 
Doherty  brothers  were,  of  course,  the  selection  of  the  doubles,  and 
quite  up  to  their  old  standard,  contrary  to  expectation. 

Ward  was  not  looked  to  for  better  than  a  hard  fight  against  H.  L. 
Doherty.  and  he  made  it.  Earned  was  expected  to  win  against  Smith, 
and  he  failed  signally.  Tliis  ended  all  chance  of  America's  winning.  It 
looked  at  one  stage  as  though  Ward  would  win,  since  he  took  the  first 
two  sets  from  Doherty,  playing  the  net  remarkably  and  volleying 
sharply  to  the  sides,  keeping  the  champion  in  the  back  court.  Then 
Doherty's  marvelous  steadiness  and  strength  told  and  he  took  two  sets 
easily  and  made  the  crucial  set  a  love  win. 

At  the  start  it  was  give  and  take,  with  the  advantage  finally  break- 
ing with  Doherty  at  5/4.  Ward  took  the  tenth  game,  but  Doherty  twice 
won  vantage,  but  each  time  Ward  blocked  him.  Then,  in  the  fifteenth 
game.  Ward  broke  througli  and  followed  with  a  win.  The  second  set 
Doherty  led  to  4/3  when  W^ard  evened  it  up  and  then  broke  through 
and  again  followed  to  a  win.  English  followers  of  the  game  grew 
Dervous,  but  the  way  Doherty  solved  the  attack  and  took  the  offensive 
in  the  third  set  was  marvelous. 

He  allowed  Ward  one  game  in  winning,  and  it  was  plain,  when  the 
American  got  but  two  games  in  the  next  set,  that  he  had  shot  his  bolt. 
Outs  and  nets  followed  each  other  rapidly,  and  seven  double  faults 
marked  Ward's  play.  Meantime  the  deadily  steadiness  of  Doherty's 
game  sent  the  American  further  off,  and  there  was  never  a  chance  in 
the  deciding  set  to  win. 

Meantime,  Smitli  was  spreadeagling  Larned  brilliantly.  He  was 
never  headed  in  the  first  set  and  won  6/4.  He  took  three  successive 
games  after  Larned  had  him  4/3  in  the  next  set.  Then  Larned  awoke 
and  got  up  to  the  net  and  ran  the  score  to  5/2  in  the  third  set.  Then 
he  faltered  and  Smith  was  able  to  take  tliree  games  before  the  erratic 
American  got  down  to  earth  again  and  took  two  games  and  the  set. 
But  he  could  not  sustain  the  rally,  and  after  leading  4/3  again  in  the 
fourth  set  he  allowed  Smith  to  regain  the  lead  and  then  to  win  the 
match  6/4. 

There  was  small  chance  of  an  American  victory  after  that.  Ward 
and  Wright  made  a  great  fight  for  it  in  the  doubles  on  the  second  day, 
hut  lost  through  Ward's  overanxiety  more  than  anything  else.  The  first 
set  went  to  America,  and  was  the  hardest  fought  of  the  tournament. 
Tlie  six  players  exchanged  games  until  the  score  reached  8-all,  with 
the  Englishmen  taking  the  odd  each  time.  Game  after  game  went  to 
deuce  and  neither  team  missed  a  chance.  Then  W^right's  great  play 
broke  through  the  Doherty's  service  and  a  brilliant  placing  of  a  smash 
won  the  next  game  and  the  set. 

Then  the  Americans  weakened,  and  although  Wright  still  played 
steadily.  Ward's  faults  cost  the  next  two  sets.  Then  the  Americans 
found  their  form  again  and  took  the  next  set.  This  brought  the  chal- 
lengers the  advantage  of  the  sei-vice  in  the  deciding  set,  and  with  their 
form  regained  the  chances  looked  good  for  victory. 

They  took  the  odd  game,  exchanging  on  their  alternating  services 
until  each  had  six  to  their  credit.  Then  Ward's  double  fault  lost  a 
chance,  and  the  Englishmen  took  advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  take 
the  lead  40/30.  Thev  gave  one  opening  an  easy  lob  that  Ward  at  the 
net  might  have  killed'  easily,  but  overanxiety  led  him  to  strike  too  soon 
and  he"  hit  the  net  and  lost  the  game.  Tliat  broke  the  rally,  and  the 
next  game  went  easily  to  England,  and  with  it  the  set  and  match. 

W'ard,  because   of  a   family   bereavement,   retired  on   the   third   day,

Clothier  being  courteously  allowed  to  take  his  place  He  managed  to 
get  one  set  from  Smith,  but  was  outclassed  in  the  others.  Then,  when 
too  late,  Larned  played  brilliantly  against  Doherty,  and  after  losing 
the  first,  took  the  next  two  sets,  but  he  weakehed  again,  and  losing 
the  fourth  6/4,  went  to  pieces  in  the  last,  and  all  five  points  were 
scored  against  us.

SECTIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 


The  Longwood  Tournament. 

By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  Championship  of  the  East  in  Doubles 
and  for  the  Longwood  Cup  in  Singles  began  on  August  7.  The  entry 
list  comprised  no  less  than  ninety-three  aspirants  in  singles  and  thirty- 
six  pairs  in  doubles — a  record  entry  list  up  to  that  time  for  this 
country. 

The  preliminary  round  in  singles  was  rather  uninteresting,  but  the 
first  round  brought  out  some  clever  tennis.  R.  D.  Little  defeated  E.  B. 
Dewhurst  in  an  interesting  four-set  match,  and  E.  W.  Leonard  defeated 
J.  C.  Davidson,  the  Southern  champion,  in  a  hard  five-set  match. 

In  the  second  round.  F.  B.  Alexander  defeated  N.  W.  Niles.  and 
Little  defeated  J.  D.  E.  .Tones,  the  Rhode  Island  champion,  in  five 
hard  sets.  M.  W.  Cabot  defeated  Wylie  Grant,  to  the  surprise  o£  the 
tennis   contingent,    in   another   five-set   match. 

Tlie  third  round  brought  a  clever  match  between  R.  LeRoy  and 
Chauncey  Seaver,  which  LeRoy  won  in  five  sets,  and  some  good  tennis 
between  F.  G.   Anderson   and  R.   D.  Little. 

In  the  fourth  round  Little  defeated  Karl  Behr  in  four  sets,  the  best 
tennis  so  far  of  the  tournament. 

The  semi-finals  brought  Hobart  vs.  Leonard  and  Alexander  vs.  Little. 
Hobart  won  from  Leonard  in  easy  fashion,  and  Alexander  scratched 
Little  in  order  to  save   himself  for   the  doubles. 

Hobart  defeated  Little  in  the  finals  by  two  sets  to  one,  only  three 
sets  being  plaved,  by  agreement,  and  Hobart  was  in  turn  defeated  in 
the  challenge  match  bv  W.  A.  Earned,,  three  sets  to  nothing.  Earned 
had  no  difficultv  ;  from  the  start  he  solved  his  opponent's  play  and 
throughout  the  match  held  him  safely.  Hobart  did  not  seem  to  have 
the  snap  shown  in  his  former  matches. 

The  preliminary  round  of  the  doubles  was  only  interesting  by  the 
fact  that  W.  J.  Clothier  and  W.  A.  Earned  withdrew  on  account  of  an 
injury  to  the  former. 

There  were  no  matches  of  importance  in  the  first  round  of  doubles. 
In  the  second  round  Holt  and  Dewhurst  defeated  Sulloway  and  Behr 
to  the  surprise  of  the  knowins:  ones  in  straight  sets.  The  third  round 
brought  a  good  five-set  match  between  Alexander  and  Hackett  and 
Little  and  LeRoy.  Throughout  the  match  Little's  fast  drop  stroke  was 
the  feature  time  after  time,  driving  through  his  opponents  for  aces. 
LeRoy  seemed  the  weak  point,  and  it  was  only  by  concentrating  their 
attention  to  him  that  Alexander  and  Hackett  were  able  to  finally 
win   out. 

The  semi-finals  brought  Codman  and  Horton  vs.  Alexander  and 
Hackett.  Grant  and  Hobart  vs.  Wrenn  and  Fincke.  Neither  match 
was  particularly  interesting. 

In  the  final  match  Alexander  and  Hackett  opposed  Wrenn  and 
Fincke.  The  match  was  played  on  a  soggy  court  before  one  of  the 
smallest  galleries  of  the  tournament  on  account  of  the  rain  which  had 
been  falling  all  day.  The  balls  had  to  be  changed  every  six  games 
and  the  footing  was  very  uncertain.  Alexander  and  Hackett  won  the 
match  in   straight   sets.      Wrenn   seemed   unable   to   handle    the   heavy 


40  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

balls  and  Fincke  was  slipping  all  over  the  court.  Hackett  played  his 
usual  steady  game,  getting  the  ball  back  every  time,  and  Alexander 
backed  him  up  in  good  shape. 

The  tennis  was  good,  taking  into  consideration  the  conditions,  and 
the  spectators  were  well  repaid  for  the  wetting  they  got  from  the 
shower  which  fell  just  before  the  match.  The  scores  :

Southern  Atlantic  States  Tournament. 

The  championship  of  the  South  Atlantic  States,  held  on  the  courts 
of  Atlanta  Athletic  Club  at  Ponce  de  Leon,  brought  a  bigger  field  of 
entries  into  competition  and  developed  a  higher  general  standard  of 
play  than  any  previous  tournament  held  for  the  titles  since  their  in- 
auguration. Forty-six  contestants  in  the  singles  and  eighteen  teams 
in  the  doubles  entered  the  lists.  In  the  singles  Cowan  Rodgers  of 
Knoxville  survived  and  met  Nat  Thornton  of  Atlanta  for  the  cham- 
pionship, succeeding  in  wresting  the  title  from  the  Georgian  in  five 
well  played  and  hotly  contested  sets.  In  the  doubles,  however,  Thornton 
in  a  measure  got  his  revenge,  when  with  Grant,  his  partner,  he  de- 
feated the  challengers  for  the  title.  Cowan  and  Charles  Rodgers,  in  a 
runaway  match.  Wonderfully  good  tennis  was  played  by  the  title 
holders  in  the  match,  while  all  through  both  single  and  double  com- 
petition the  matches  as  a  rule  were  both  well  played  and  closely  con- 
tested. 

Probably  the  best  play  in  the  single  tournament  proper  was  in  the 
semi-final  match  between  the  two  veteran  players,  L.  D.  Scott,  of 
Atlanta,  and  Cowan  Rodgers,  of  Knoxville.  Tliese  two  athletes  fought 
stubbornly  and  bitterly  for  every  point,  until  after  two  hours  of  the 
most  brilliant  tennis,  the  Knoxville  man  finally  pulled  out  the  match. 
In  all  particulars,  however,  the  challenge  match  in  singles  between 
Cowan  Rodgers  and  Nat  Thornton,  of  Atlanta,  equalled  it  in  skill, 
activity,  endurance  and  heady  play.  It  took  the  full  five  sets  to  de- 
cide the  match.  In  this  match  there  were  57  games,  Rodgers  winning 
30  and  Thornton  27  ;  there  were  340  points,  Rodgers  securing  184  and 
Thornton  156,  a  difference  of  28  in  favor  of  the  champion. 

In  the  doubles,  undoubtedly  the  match  of  the  tournament  was  the 
final  match  between  the  Rodgers  brothers,  of  Knoxville.  and  Elliott 
and  Post,  of  New  Orleans,  played  Monday  morning.  Sixty  games, 
many  of  them  deuce  games,  were  played,  Rodgers  winning  31  and 
Elliott  and  Post  capturing  29.  In  the  first  set  Rodgers  brothers 
twice  needed  but  one  point  to  secure  the  set,  but  lost  it.  In  the  fifth 
set,  Elliott  and  Post  at  one  time  needed  but  two  points  to  win  the  set 
and  the  match,  but  could  not  pull  them  out.  The  full  five  sets  were 
necessary  to  secure  a  decision  and  again  the  Knoxville  men  proved 
victorious. 

The  challenge  match  in  doubles,  while  never  close,  furnished  some 
exceptional  tennis.  Grant  and  Tliornton,  the  swift  Atlanta  holders  of 
the  cup,  ran  away  with  the  challengers,  the  Rodgers  brothers,  and 
won  out  in  straight  sets.  The  record  of  this  speedy  young  double  team 
is  little  short  of  marvelous.  In  the  past  two  years  they  have  entered 
five  tournaments,  capturing  the  double  championship  in  each,  without 
the  loss  of  a  single  set. 

Of  the  younger  players,  Yarborough,  of  Augusta  ;  Smith.  Phelps  and 
Logan,  of  New  Orleans  ;  McCorvey,  of  Mobile,  and  Charlton  Smith  and 
Howell,  of  Atlanta,  showed  up  well,  and  will  all  be  dangerous  men  in 
future  tournaments.

4A  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Southern  Championship. 

The  Southern  Championships  were  most  important  last  year,  since 
they  marl^ed  the  passing  of  the  challenge  cup  that  has  held  the  centre 
of  interest  for  a  decade.  Its  permanent  possession  by  J.  C.  Davidson, 
as  a  result  of  his  victory  over  champion  Harry  F.  Allen,  and  his  two 
prior  victories  in  years  gone  by,  removes  it  from  further  competition. 
This  enables  the  Southerners  to  carry  out  their  long-cherished  ambition 
to  move  the  scene  of  play  further  South  to  attract  the  real  Southern 
players  and  eliminate  the  Northerners  who,  in  the  past,  have  played  so 
important  a  part  in  their  competitions. 

There  were  three  Northern  men  in  the  championship  last  year,  Alletv, 
the  holder  ;  Little  and  Paret,  who.  with  Davidson,  had  each  won  the 
cup  twice.  Little  was  unexpectedly  put  out  of  the  second  round  by 
the  Washington  player,  Geoghegan.  Paret  fell  a  victim  to  Coulston  in 
the  third  round,  the  Maryland  champion  taking  two  of  three  hard- 
fought  sets.  This  left  the  South  free  to  win  the  tournament  and  meet 
the  holder.  There  was  no  man  better  fitted  to  do  this  than  J.  C. 
Davidson,  and  events  proved  his  fitness. 

In  the  semi-final,  Davidson  eliminated  Coulston,  and  the  veteran, 
Glazebrook,  accounted  for  Gordon.  Both  matches  took  three  sets  to 
decide  and  were  hard  fought.  In  the  final  four  sets  were  required  to 
decide  supremacy  between  Glazebrook  and  Davidson.  Tlie  final  score 
stood  9/7,  4/6,  6/4,  6/2  in  favor  of  Davidson.  Both  adopted  a  style 
of  back  line  play  in  which  Davidson  showed  himself  somewhat  the 
stronger,  making  less  off-plays  and  placing  his  balls  to  better  advan- 
tage. The  hardest  playing  was  in  the  first  and  third  sets,  Davidson 
winning  them  after  careful,  uphill  work.  Glazebrook  won  the  second 
set  rather  easily.     The  score  in  detail  of  the  match  follows  :

In  the  challenge  round  Davidson  outplayed  Allen  without  great 
trouble,  and  might  have  won  in  straight  sets  had  he  not  taken  things 
easy  in  the  third  set  after  capturing  the  first  two.  Davidson  played  a 
far  steadier  game  than  Allen  and  was  more  accurate  in  his  drives, 
although  the  latter  played  brilliantly  at  times  and  readily  surpassed 
Davidson  in  fast,  dashing  and  smashing  work  at  the  net.  The  winner 
played  on  the  defensive  most  of  the  time,  with  Allen  the  aggressoT,  and 
depended  largely  on  his  almost  perfect  drives  to  the  back  of  the  court 
to  pass  and  defeat  his  opponent.  Allen  did  most  of  his  scoring  by 
rushing  to  the  net  and  smashing  the  ball  on  Davidson's  first  return, 
but  sometimes  the  latter  overcame  this  by  beautiful  lobbing  to  the  back 
of  the  court.  Allen  served  a  peculiar  twisting  ball,  very  difficult  to 
play  safely,  and  he  gained  many  points  on  this  account,  while  David- 
son gave  Allen  quite  a  few  unearned  points  by  driving  into  the  net. 
On  the  whole,  however,  Davidson's  accuracy  and  superior  science  and 
strategy  gave  him  a  well-earned,  handily  won  victory.

New  England  Championship. 

Karl  Behr,  the  Yale  champion,  was  the  winner  of  the  singles  in  the 
New  England  championship  and  challenger  for  the  title.  In  the  ab- 
sence of  Beals  Wright  in  England  he  took  it  by  default.  The  doubles 
went  to  Robert  Leroy  and  W'ylie  C.  Grant.  The  matches  in  both  singles 
and  doubles  were  splendidly  contested  throughout  and  showed  high 
class  tennis. 

Twenty-four  entrants  appeared  for  the  singles,  requiring  eight  pre- 
liminary matches.  These  were  without  incident  of  note,  the  better 
players  winning  readily,  except  in  the  case  of  W^ylie  Grant.     E.  T.  Gross 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


« 


of  Providence  forced  him  to  a  ttiree-set  match,  all  three  of  which  were 
hard  fought.  Grant  put  up  a  disappointing  game  against  Karl  Behr 
in  the  opening  round  and  lost,  6/2,  6/2.  Again,  the  class  players  won 
readily. 

The  four  men  to  survive  the  second  round  were  "Ware,  Behr,  Leroy 
and  Nettleton.  Leroy  had  to  fight  for  every  point  in  his  match  with 
Jackson,  though  he  won  in  straight  sets.  In  the  semi-finals,  Ware  gave 
Behr  a  fine  battle  in  the  second  set,  which  he  won,  but  he  lost  the 
first  and  third  rather  tamely.  Leroy  forced  Nettleton  to  the  limit  in 
two  well-played  sets,  but  went  down  in  both. 

This  brought  Nettleton  and  Behr  up  for  the  final.  The  two  players 
have  frequently  played  each  other  in  New  Haven  and  their  knowledge 
of  each  other's  game  made  their  play  extremely  cautious  and  heady, 
and  there  was  a  marked  similarity  in  their  methods  throughout  the 
match.  Both  played  for  the  greater  part  a  back-line  game,  Behr,  how- 
ever, more  frequently  assuming  the  aggressive  and  obtaining  the  net, 
a  dangerous  proceeding  on  account  of  Nettleton's  accuracy  in  passing, 
his  opponent. 

The  first  two  sets  were  won  by  Behr  by  9/7  and  6/2.  It  looked 
at  this  time  like  a  straight  win  by  Behr  in  three  sets,  but  Nettleton^ 
after  losing  the  first  game  with  a  love  score,  showed  great  improve- 
ment, cutting  the  side  lines  frequently  with  his  drives  and  cross-court 
shots,  and  this,  assisted  by  a  slight  weakening  on  the  part  of  Behr, 
gave  him  the  set  in  easy  fashion,  6/2. 

Neither  player  could  obtain  any  distinct  advantage  up  to  the  tenth 
game  of  the  fourth,  when  Behr,  with  the  set  5/4,  seemed  to  have  vic- 
tory almost  within  his  grasp,  but  at  this  point  Nettleton  rallied 
strongly,  bringing  the  score  to  deuce  twice  and  finally  landing  the 
game,  making  the  score  5  all.  TTie  contest  went  to  11-all  without 
either  player  obtaining  any  decided  advantage,  each  winning  the  game 
necessary  to  bring  the  score  back  to  deuce  with  comparative  ease.  Thfr 
twenty-third  game  was  a  hard  one.  deuce  being  called  seven  times,  and 
was  finally  won  by  Nettleton,  making  the  score  in  the  latter's  favor 
12/11.  In  the  next  game  Nettleton  quickly  ran  the  score  to  40  love, 
and  was  three  times  within  a  point  ofwinning  the  set,  but  Behr  rallied' 
brilliantly,  as  his  opponent  had  done  previously  in  the  set,  and  finally^ 
won  the  game  at  deuce.  After  13-all  had  been  called  Nettleton  won 
the  next  two  games  princioally  on  his  opponent's  errors  and  thus 
finally  landed  the  set,  15/13? 

The  players  then  started  in  for  the  fifth  and  deciding  set.  Nettleton. 
began  with  a  rush,  winning  the  first  two  games,  the  first  a  love-1  and 
the  second  after  deuce  had  been  called  four  times.  Behr  steadied  and 
won  the  next  three  games,  in  the  first  two  not  allowing  his  opponent 
to  score  a  point.  Nettleton  obtained  the  lead  of  4/3.  Behr  at  this 
junction  forced  the  playing,  trying  for  the  net  at  every  opportunity 
and  cutting  short  Nettleton's  shots  with  the  best  net  playing  of  the 
day.  This  change  of  play  won  him  the  next  three  games  and  the  fifth, 
and  deciding  set,  6/4.

Only  six  teams  appeared  in  the  doubles,  but  the  games  contested 
were  remarkable.  In  the  opening  round,  W'are  and  Gross  met  Nettle-

before  they  finally  weakened  in  the  first  set.  They  were  beaten  14/12.

Smith  and  Northrup,  the  Williams  players.  The  first  set  the  New 
York  pair  won,  6/3,  fairly  easily,  but  in  the  second  the  games  were

In  the  final,  Ware  and  Gross  took  the  first  set  from  Leroy  and 
Grant,  6/4,  but  both  the  second  and  third  were  won,  8/6,  each  getting 
one.  With  another  set  to  win,  the  New  England  men  went  to  pieces 
in  the  fourth  set  and  lost  6-love,  while  they  did  little  better  in  the  de- 
ciding trial,  losing,  6/3.

Middle  States  Championship. 

By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Middle  States 
was  begun  on  the  Orange  Lawn  Tennis  courts,  June  26.  The  entry  list 
was  high  class,  considering  the  fact  that  the  American  tennis  team 
was  abroad.  The  only  match  of  importance  in  the  first  round  in 
singles  was  the  one  between  Alexander  and  Stevens.  Stevens  seemed 
to  be  out  of  practice  and  lost  in  straight  sets.  The  second  round 
brought  no  upsets,  all  the  ranked  men  coming  through  with  the  excep- 
tion of  H.  F.  Allen,  who  was  beaten  by  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  and  T.  R. 
Pell,  who  was  defeated  by  H.  K.  Behr. 

In  the  semi-final  rovmd  Alexander  defeated  Behr  in  three  sets  and, 
much  to  the  surprise  of  the  spectators,  LeRoy  defeated  G.  L.  Wrenn, 
after  losing  the  first  set,  6/1.  The  match  was  very  interesting.  LeRoy 
depending  entirelv  on  his  backcourt  game  and  passing  strokes. 

The  final  match  between  LeRoy  and  Alexander  proved  rather  unin- 
teresting after  the  first  set,  LeRoy  not  doing  himself  justice  in  the 
last   three. 

The  challenge  match  between  C.  Hobart  (holder)  and  F.  B.  Alexander 
(challenger)  lasted  three  hours  and  a  half  and  proved  a  heart-breaking 
contest.  Hobart  won  the  first  two  sets  and  seemed  invincible,  but 
let  down  in  the  third  and  fourth,  which  Alexander  won.  In  the  fifth 
set  Hobart  came  back  into  his  stride  and  led.  3/0  and  5/3,  but  finally 
lost,  8/6.  The  feature  of  the  match  was  Hobarfs  speedy  forehand 
drive.  Alexander  was  compelled  to  play  entirely  from  the  base  line, 
as  he  seemed  unable  to  volley  Hobart's  fierce  drop  ball. 

The  doubles  were  won  by  Hackett  and  Alexander,  who  played  Hobart 
and  Wadsworth  in  the  finals,  winning  two  out  of  three  sets.  This 
match  was  played  after  the  final  singles  and  was  poor  tennis,  as 
Hobart  and  Alexander  were  pretty  well  done  up  from  that  severe 
match. 

The  earlier  rounds  of  the  doubles  were  rather  upsetting,  as  Wrenn 
and  Fincke  were  beaten  by  Allen  and  Pell  and  Little  and  LeRoy  by 
Hobart  and  Wadsworth. 

The  ladies'  singles  were  won  by  Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely  of  Chicago, 
and  the  doubles  by  Miss  Neely  and  Mrs.  Holden.

Followers  of  tennis  unhesitatingly  say  that  the  game  enjoyed  ^ore 
vogue  in  the  middle  west  in  1905  than  ever  before.  They  are  equally 
emphatic  in  predicting  for  the  sport  the  proverbial  "best  ever  and 
then  some"  for  1906. 

"In  my  opinion,"  says  Champion  Kriegh  Collins,  "tennis  is  making 
winning  strides  at  the  expense  of  golf.  This  I  think  is  true  in  nearly 
every  big  country  club  center  in  the  east.  There  are  sections  in  the 
west,  particularly  the  Elgin-Aurora  district,  where  tennis  play  has 
assumed  almost  the  old  epidemic  form.  There  would  be  no  surprise 
were  there  to  be  enough  tournaments  in  the  district  just  west  of  Chi- 
cago next  year  to  fill  many  pages  of  the  Guide." 

Another  feature  of  tennis  play  that  developed  in  1905  to  such  an 
extent  that  old  followers  of  the  court  game  are  much  pleased  is  tht* 
wide  use  of  the  public  lawns  in  parks  by  the  masses  for  tennis  con- 
tests, both  scheduled  events  between  little  clubs  and  the  impromptu 
events  that  busy  men  play  in  for  the  needed  exercise.  It  was  no 
uncommon  sight  during  the  summer  and  autumn,  of  1905  to  see  tennis 
being  played  in  the  south  parks  of  Chicago  so  early  as  5  o'clock  in 
the  morning 

"And  the  men  who  carried  their  nets  to  the  meadows  and  put  them 
up  for  the  before-breakfast  games,"  remarked  L.  H.  Waidner,  "were 
employes  of  the  big  ofiice  buildings  down  town.  They  came  early  to 
avoid  the  rush,  put  in  an  hour  or  so  at  the  sport,  had  their  breakfasts 
and  after  hasty  plunges  in  cool  water  in  the  home  bath  tubs,  dressed 
and  hurried  to  their  desks.  It  seems  to  those  who  are  outdoors  a  great 
deal  during  the  summer  months  following  tennis  play  that  these  vo- 
taries are  entitled  to  dividends  on  health  as  the  result  of  their  faith- 
ful devotion  to  the  game." 

Not  since  the  old  days  of  the  famous  lake  front  exposition  build- 
ing— days  when  there  were  no  sky  scrapers  on  the  Michigan  Avenue 
building  line  and  tennis  was  young  in  the  west — has  there  been  a 
real  indoor  tennis  tourney.  About  a  decade  ago  canvas  was  laid  upon 
a  temporary  board  floor  in  the  parquet  of  the  Auditorium  theatre  and 
outdoor  tennis  enthusiasts  created  considerable  interest  in  an  in- 
formal indoor  tourney.  But  the  society  features  of  the  function  ap- 
pealed more  to  the  participants  than  the  benefits  to  be  gained  from 
the  exercise  and  there  were  few  who  advocated  the  continuance  of 
indoor  tennis.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  57 

However,  a  strong  sentiment  in  favor  of  establishing  indoor  tennis 
as  a  regular  feature  of  western  athletics,  has  developed  and  with  such 
men  as  Collins,  Waidner,  Stern,  Hunt,  etc.,  ready  to  give  the  plan 
impetus  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  next  winter  will  see 
many  courts  in  operation.  Plain  board  floors  or  canvas-covered  areas 
will  be  available.  The  largest  club  gymnasium  in  the  country,  it  is 
said,  will  be  located  on  the  top  floor  of  a  new  organization  in  Chicago 
and  the  officers  of  that  club  have  promised  the  leading  tennis  players 
of  the  Kenwood  Country  Club  that  one  court  shall  be  continuously 
at  their  disposal  during  the  indoor  season. 

It  is  not  maintained  by  the  best  of  the  1905  outdoor  court  players 
that  indoor  play  will  tend  to  improve  the  grass  court  players'  form 
to  any  extent.  The  main  element  of  value  in  the  winter  game,  how- 
ever, is  in  its  effect  upon  the  players'  physical  condition.  The  exer- 
cise, like  that  of  handball,  makes  for  speed,  accuracy  and  that  great 
requisite,  wind. 

Collins  has  promised  to  defend  his  western  title  in  singles  once 
more.  Seven  times  he  has  made  himself  the  premier  player  of  the 
western  championship  tourneys  and  one  cup  was  taken  by  him  because 
he  won  it  in  hard  competition.  He  aspires  to  getting  the  third  and 
final  leg  on  the  new  trophy  and  then  may  step  down  from  the  singles 
world  and  permit  some  of  the  coming  tennis  experts  to  flght  for  it. 

Tliere  was  a  formidable  looking  entry  list  for  the  annual  event  for 
men  at  the  Kenwood  courts  in  1905  but  almost  as  soon  as  it  appeared 
the  critics  began  picking  the  men  to  last  through  to  the  concluding 
matches.  This  is  nothing  more  than  natural  to  the  keen  followers  of 
tennis  "dope"  for  they  annually  have  about  the  same  fields  to  select 
winners  from.  It  illustrates  forcibly  the  plea  of  Champion  Collins  for 
greater  interest  in  the  entry  blanks  and  a  bigger  turn  out — in  hopes 
that  some  new  stars  may  appear  on  the  turf  horizon. 

Of  course  a  tourney  without  a  distinct  slip-up  would  be  a  compara- 
tive novelty.  There  was  nothing  surprising  in  tlie  western  until  Nat 
Emerson,  the  Cincinnati  player,  encountered  Waidner  in  the  final 
round.  It  will  be  recalled  that  Waidner  had  been  playing  a  lot  in 
doubles  with  Collins  and  may  have  been  off  edge.  But  Emerson,  play- 
ing a  trifle  above  himself,  was  long  on  "anticipatory  work"  that  after- 
noon and  won  from  the  man  who  had  been  generally  picked  for  the 
championship  round.  6/2.  G/3,  1/6,  6/4.  Those  who  witnessed  the 
hard-fought  match  thought  that  Emerson,  who  played  all  over  the 
court  and  rapidly  exhausted  his  strength,  would  have  been  physically 
unable  to  continue  had  Waidner  been  successful  in  getting  the  fourth 
set.  The  tall  fellow  was  puffing  and  seemed  all  in,  as  the  critics  said, 
whereas  the  cool  W'aidner  seemed  to  be  getting  his  secondary  strength 
well  to  the  fore. 

Emerson  was  beaten  badly  at  Cincinnati,  playing  the  same  style 
that  he  used  against  Waidner.  But  he  was  less  fortunate  in  the  Buck- 
eye State  play  in  anticipating  the  flight  of  the  ball.  AVaidner  did  not 
display  the  same  prowess  he  has  shown  in  battles  with  Clothier  and 
other  good  tennis  players  in  disguising  his  shots  and  Emerson  was  able 
to  annihilate  space  in  that  2S-foot  runway,  thereby  fortunately  getting 
in  front  of  the  play  in  time  to  handle  it.  Besides  he  was  in  high 
form  in  clever  serving  and  made  no  faults. 

But  in  the  season  of  1906  Emerson  as  well  as  Will  Hunt  may  set  a 
pace  that  will  be  hard  for  the  other  experts  to  follow.  Their  game 
has  been  favorably  comtnented  npon  throughout  the  area  where  they 
have  played  in  tourneys.  Reuben  Hunt  too  is  expected  to  show  im- 
provement. There  are  many  who  have  been  "rooting" — to  borrow  a 
term  from  base  ball — for  "Rube"  for  some  time.  Out  in  the  Rocky 
Mountain  country  they  entertain  the  highest  regard  for  Hunt.  In 
California  where"  he  riiakes  his  home  they  are  eagerly  awaiting  the 
day  when  he  shall  capture  the  championship.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  59 

Russ  and  Cresson,  the  Texans,  showed  glimpses  of  Doherty  form 
during  western  play  in  1905.  Burton,  the  Minneapolis  player,  too,  is 
on  the  list  of  high  class  performers  whose  play  will  be  watched  care- 
fully in  1906.  He  is  of  championship  calibre,  say  many  of  the  close 
students   of  the  game. 

Collins  and  Waidner  won  doubles  honors  in  every  tourney  in  which 
they  tried  for  them  with  one  exception — down  east.  They  expect  to 
be  together  in  1906  and  make  the  same  good  fight  for  premier  honors. 
In  the  western  they  were  opposed  by  Russ  and  Cresson  in  the  final 
round  and  won  after  losing  one  set,  7/5,  6/2,  5/7  and  6/2. 

Miss  Myrtle  McAteer  easily  took  final  honors  for  women  in  the 
singles  but  with  her  partner,  Mrs.  Neff,  lost  to  Misses  Neely  and 
Steever  in  the  doubles.  The  absence  of  Miss  Sutton  in  the  western 
doubtless  increased  the  interest  of  the  other  players  in  the  tourney,  for 
everybody  is  well  satisfied  that  Miss  Sutton  is  in  a  class  by  herself. 

One  of  the  interesting  tournaments  of  the  season  was  the  Western 
Interscholastic,  played  .Tune  16-21  at  the  University  of  Chicago  courts. 
Premier  honors  were  taken  by  Lawrence  (Shorty)  Stern  of  Hyde  Park 
High  School,  who  won  the  finals  in  five  brilliantly  played  sets,  defeat- 
ing his  teammate,  .Joseph  Sunderland.  It  will  be  recalled  that  Stern 
in  1904  won  the  interscholastic  championship  of  the  world  at  the 
Olympian  games  at  St.  Louis  and  subsequently  put  up  a  strong  show- 
ing in  the  western  championship.  Stem's  style  is  of  the  whirlwind 
order  but  in  the  contest  with  Sunderland  he  was  forced  to  extend 
himself    to    his    limit,    occasionally. 

First  honors  in  doubles  in  this  tourney  also  went  to  Hyde  Park, 
Stern  playing  with  Sunderland  and  defeating  Henry  &  Kuh  of  Uni- 
versity High  in  the  finals,  6/3.  7/5,  6/8,  6/1.  An  unparalleled  amoimt 
of  rain  fell  during  the  period  of  this  tourney  and  much  of  the  play 
was  held  on  courts  so  badly  soaked  that  a  true  line  on  the  form  of 
some  of  the  participants  could  not  be  had.

Middle  West  Tennis  Championship,  1905. 

The  fifth  annual  open  tennis  tournament  for  the  championship  of 
the  Middle  West  in  both  gentlemen's  singles  and  doubles,  was  held,  as 
usual,  on  the  splendid  courts  of  the  Omaha  Field  Club,  the  week  be- 
ginning August  21,  1905. 

It  was  the  most  successful  of  any  in  the  history  of  the  event,  the 
entry  list  being  larger  than  previous  years,  there  being  some  sixty- 
eight  entries  of  the  most  representative  tennis  players  of  the  Middle 
West. 

T'he  committee  received  favorable  comments  on  the  unique  and  at- 
tractive announcement  folder  sent  out  this  year,  and  souvenir  hat- 
bands given  the  players,  which  they  wore  during  the  week,  gave 
Omaha  quite  the  appearance  of  a  college  town.  With  the  exception  of 
one-half  day,  the  weather  conditions  were  very  favorable  to  good  play. 
Much  interest  was  taken  in  the  event,  as  shown  by  the  large  and  en- 
thusiastic galleries,  which  were  in  attendance  during  all  of  the  big 
matches. 

The  visiting  players  were  entertained  most  royally  every  evening 
■during  the  week,  as  follows  :  Monday — Initiation,  Knights  of  Ak-Sar- 
Ben.  Tuesday — burlesque  athletic  carnival  ;  Wednesday — dance  at  the 
club  ;  Thursday — automobile  ride  ;  Friday — a  dinner  ;  Saturday — pre- 
sentation of  prizes  and  dance  at  tlie  club. 

Some  two  thousand  people  witnessed  the  Peters-Gilman  matcli,  in 
the  semi-final  round  on  Thursday,  and  the  whole  gallery  turned  its  at- 
tention to  the  battle  between  these  two.  Peters  won  the  first  set,  6/4, 
but  he  had  no  walkaway,  for  Oilman  scored  31  points  to  his  37.  Gil- 
man  made  a  plucky  fight  all  the  way  through,  but  he  was  somewhat 
tired  from  his  hard  match  with  Sanderson  in  the  morning.  Peters 
had  tlie  score  3/0  in  the  second  set.  when  Oilman  took  a  brace  and 
won  the  next  six  straight  games.  Peters  won  the  next  two  sets  and 
match. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  63 

"Smiling"  Peters  won  the  gallery  by  his  gentlemanly  play  and  in 
several  small  things,  which  could  not  escape  the  crowd.  On  one  oc- 
casion, when  he  thought  that  the  referee  had  given  him  a  point  to 
whicli  he  was  not  entitled,  he  deliberately  served  two  faults  to  even 
matters. 

That  the  Missouri  Valley  is  still  able  to  raise  cornfed  tennis  play- 
ers, who  can  compete  with  the  players  of  tlie  effete  East  was  clearly 
demonstrated,  on  Thursday  of  the  tournament,  when  Gilman  of  Sioux 
City  defeated  Sanderson  of  Galesburg,  and  Hayes  of  Toledo  (Iowa) 
defeated  Snow  of  Chicago,  the  crack  Kenwood  player. 

The  last  match  was  a  great  surprise  to  many  of  the  followers  of 
the  tournament,  who  had  admired  the  fine  form  and  splendid  style  of 
Snow.  He  played  a  beautifully  finished  game,  but  the  superb  placing 
and  the  great  activity  of  his  opponent  was  too  much  for  him.  Score, 
6/1.  7/5,  G/4. 

Gilman  furnished  the  surprise  of  the  day  when  he  defeated  Sander- 
son, who  was  champion  in  1002.  This  was  accomplished  by  his  su- 
perior placing  and  by  a  cut  lobbed  ball,  which  forced  Sanderson  back 
from  the  net  and  kept  liim  in  the  back  court,  where  he  was  not  able 
to  do  his  best,  his  favorite  style  being  a  net  game.     Score,  6/4,  6/3. 

The  verandas  and  lawns  of  the  Field  Club  were  packed  with  an 
enthusiastic  audience,  until  room  was  at  a  premium,  wlien  Peters  and 
Hayes  began  their  match.  Hayes  beat  Peters  in  three  straight  sets, 
6/4,  6/2,  8/6.  The  lengthy  lowan  ran  Peters  all  over  the  court,  and 
it  seemed  impossible  for  the  Chicago  man  to  pass  him  at  tlie  net. 
Peters  seemed  to  tire  out  and  weaken,  under  the  hard  strain  of  run- 
ning back  and  fortli  across  the  rear  of  the  courts,  where  Hayes  con- 
tinually put  the  ball.  Hayes  used  splendid  judgment  on  when  to  take 
the  net,  and  it  seemed  as  if  Peters  could  not  place  the  ball  beyond 
his  reach.  Hayes  was  indefatigable  ;  he  played  superior  tennis  all  the 
way  through  and  deserved  to  win. 

The  challenge  match,  between  Fletcher  and  Hayes  on  Saturday 
brought  out  the  largest  gallery  of  the  week,  with  pretty  gowns  pre- 
dominating. The  consensus  of  opinion,  among  those  who  saw  Fletcher 
win  the  championship  last  year  from  Frank  Eberhardt,  was  that  he 
did  not  play  his  game,  but  this  does  not  detract  from  the  splendid 
victory  Mr.  Hayes  won.  Fletcher  netted  many  balls,  which  was  un- 
usual for  him.  Hayes  was  also  able  to  pass  him  on  cross  court  shots, 
andl  on  the  whole,  played  a  much  steadier  game.  Both  played  a  back 
court  game  nearly  all  of  the  time,  although  Fletcher  would  occasion- 
ally try  the  net.  Hayes'  tactics  of  placing  the  ball  far  into  tlie  back 
court,  and  cross-courting  liis  opponent,  won  him  the  match.  Fletcher 
tried  both  the  back  court  and  net  game,  but  neither  seemed  effective 
against  the  superb  placing  of  the  lowan.     The  score  : 

Haves     1     1     2     4     4     4     4     4     1     0     7     2     2    4     5     4     9—49 

Fletcher     4     4     4     2     2     2     0     1     4     4     5     4     4     1     3     1     7 — 15

Fletcher     4     1     4     1     2     2     1     1—15 

Sanderson  and  Fletcher  of  Galesburg,  by  defeating  Snow  and 
Peters  of  Chicago,  won  the  title  of  Champions  in  Doubles.  The  Eber- 
hardt brothers,  last  vear's  champions,  did  not  appear  to  defend  their 
title,  so  the  cups  went  to  the  winners  of  the  tournament. 

The  Galesburg  pair  won  by  superior  overhead  work  and  the  lob 
game,  to  which  the  Kenwood  Club  men  are  not  accustomed,  their  style 
being  more  of  the  low  driving  sort,  with  hard  smashes.

Northwestern  Lawn  Tennis  Championship,  1905. 

By  W^ard  C.  Burton. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Northwest  was 
held  under  the  auspices  of  the  Minnetonka  Yacht  Club,  at  Deephaven, 
Lake  Minnetonka,  July  24,  and  continuing  through  the  rest  of  the 
week.  The  turf  courts,  which  were  in  splendid  condition,  did  much  to 
increase  the  general  excellence  of  the  play. 

In  the  singles  tournament,  interest  centered  about  Collins,  Hunt, 
Waidner,  Stern  and  Watson,  of  the  visiting  players,  and  Burton, 
Graves,  Jayne  and  G.  K.  Belden,  of  the  local  players.  In  the  upper 
half  Collins,  by  steady,  perfect  playing,  reached  the  finals  with  but 
little  difficulty,  where  he  met  his  team  mate,  Waidner,  who  had  won 
from  Watson,  H.   I.  Belden  and  G.   K.  Belden. 

The  match  between  Collins  and  Waidner,  hard  fought  throughout, 
with  both  men  playing  a  hard  driving  game,   was   in  many   ways   the

best  match  ever  witnessed  at  Deephaven,  and  probably  the  closest  of 
the  many  matches  between  these  rivals  in  Western  tennis. 

In  the  challenge  match,  R.  G.  Hunt,  the  defender,  after  clearly  out- 
playing Collins  in  the  first  set,  lost  the  next  three  sets  in  a  manner 
that  hardly  represents  the  difference  between  the  respective  players. 
Thus  the  championship  went  to  Collins  by  the  score  of  4/6,  6/1,  6/2, 
6/2. 

Tliose  plavers,  each  of  whom  now  have  one  leg  on  the  challenge 
cup,  are  A.  'C.  Snow,  R.  D.  Little,  L.  H.  Waldner,  R.  G.  Hunt  and 
Kriegh  Collins. 

In  the  doubles  tournament,  the  semi-finals  match  between  Collms 
and  Wiiidner,  and  Hunt  and  Burton,  not  only  proved  most  interesting, 
but  developed  into  the  most  brilliant  match  in  doubles  played  in  the 
West  during  the  season  of  190.5.  The  low.  deep  lobbing  of  Collins, 
the  consistent  driving  of  Burton,  the  masterful  overhead  work  of 
Hunt,  and  Waidner's  powerful  smashing,  combined  with  the  apparent 
ability  of  all  four  players  to  return  impossible  shots,  resulted  in  ideal 
tennis,  which  was  gre'atly  appreciated  by  the  large  gallery.  The  su- 
perior team  work  of  Collins  and  Waidner  infused  their  play  with  that 
steadiness  which  alwavs  wins  close  matches. 

In  the  upper  half  Belden  brothers  won  their  way  to  the  finals  with 
such  ease  that  it  was  a  surprise  and  a  disappointment  to  have  them 
so  easily  outclassed  by  Collins  and  Waidner,  who  won  in  straight 
sets,  6/1,  6/3,   6/2. 

N.  Werner  won  the  consolation  singles.     The  summary  :

The  Missouri  Valley  Tennis  Tournament. 

The  playing  of  the  Missouri  Valley  Tennis  Tournament  at  Kansas 
Mty — July  26  to  August  3 — was  handicapped  by  an  unusually  bad 
pell  of  weather,  but  the  conditions  were  met  by  securing  Convention 
lall  and  playing  the  opening  rounds  of  the  tournament  indoors.  The 
ournament  was  handled  this  year  by  the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Ciub, 
s  that  body  had  absorbed  the  old  Dykington  Tennis  Club,  which  had 
een  the  ruling  power  in  this  branch  of  sport  for  some  fifteen  years 
nd  under  whose  auspices  the  event  has  been  held  for  several  seasons 
ast.  The  entries  in  singles  numbered  fifty-six.  while  twenty-four 
eams  paired  off  in  doubles.  Considerably  more  than  half  the  entries 
.'ere  from  out  of  town,  and  as  the  opening  day  found  torrents  of  rain 
ailing,  it  was  useless  to  thinli  of  playing  out  of  doors.  After  consult- 
fig  the  visiting  players,  it  was  decided  to  open  the  tournament  in- 
oors  and  arrangements  were  at  once  made  to  that  effect.  The  day 
iillowing  continued  stormy,  but  the  indoor  playing  proved  very  satis- 
actory  and  the  matches  were  pushed  through  in  excellent  shape.  The 
oor  of  the  hall  is  of  cement  and  was  not  unlike  playing  on  a  good 
ard  clay  court  in  effecting  the  bouncing  of  the  ball.  Play  was  even 
esumed  in  the  evening,  several  matches  being  pulled  off  by  electric 
ght.  Play  began  on  the  outdoor  courts  the  afternoon  of  the  second 
ay.  The  preliminary  round  brought  out  no  particularly  brilliant 
snnis,  as  the  cracks  all  drew  easy  players  and  so  won  handily.  In 
tie  second  round,  however,  T.  P.  Gleeson,  of  St.  Louis,  and  W.  S. 
rilman,  of  Sioux  City,  furnished  one  of  the  most  exciting  matches  of 
lie  tournament,  the  Sioux  City  man  finally  landing  the  match  after 
liree   sets  of   the   hardest  kind  of  play. 

The  third  round  found  F'.  E.  Sheldon  and  J.  S.  Trifle,  both  Kansas 
ity  A.C.  men.  pitted  against  each  other,  the  match  being  won  by  the 
>rmer  in  straight  sets.  Herbert  Jones,  Kansas  City  A.C,  defeated 
•ilman,  the  Sioux  City  crack,  in  comparatively  easy'  style,  while  D. 
,.  James  beat  H.  S.  Vaughn,  and  W.  E.  Easton,  of  St.  Louis,  disposed 
fi  C.  S.  Carey,  of  Sioux  City.  Tlie  results  of  this  round  placed  Shel- 
en  vs.  Jones  and  James  vs.   T^aston  in  the  semi-finals. 

Jones'  showing  against  Sheldon  was  disappointing,  as  he  was  picked 
y  many  to  win  the  tournament,  but  the  careful  playing  of  his  more 
xperienced  opponent  was  too  much  for  him  and  he  went  down  to  de- 
?at  by  scores  of  6/1,  6/3.  Easton  gave  James  a  hard  run  in  the 
rst  set,  which  went  to  the  latter,  7/5,  but  could  not  hold  the  pace 
ad  lost  the  second  set  and  match.  6/2.  With  the  contest  narrowed 
own  to  Shelden  and  James,  some  exciting  tennis  was  in  prospect  and 
le  spectators  were  not  disappointed.  Both  are  veterans  in  the  game 
nd  knowing  each  other's  style  of  play,  as  they  did,  were  prepared  to 
irnish  some  sensational  playing. 

James  started  off  in  whirlwind  style,  winning  the  first  two  sets,  6/3, 
/3.  He  seemed  to  let  up  in  the  next  set.  however,  while  Shelden  im- 
roved  and  succeeded  in  winning.  6/0.  After  this  spurt,  though,  Shel- 
en  was  never  in  the  game,  as  James  renewed  his  efforts  and  won  the 
Durth  set  quite  easily,  6/2.  In  the  championship  round  James  met  O. 
'.  Vernon,  holder  of  the  Missouri  Valley  title,  and  the  match  was 
roductive  of  some  of  the  best  tennis  ever  seen  on  a  local  court.    James

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  71 

was  cool  and  aggressive  and  opened  the  match  in  his  accustomed 
whirlwind  style,  which  seemed  too  fast  for  the  champion,  who,  al- 
though playing  a  good  game,  seemed  no  match  for  his  speedy  opponent, 
as  the  set  went  to  James,  6/2.  Vernon,  however,  assumed  the  aggres- 
sive himself  in  thei  second  act  and  continued  into  the  third  set,  which 
he  won,  6/1,  6/1.  His  style  of  play  is  unique,  as  he  uses  his  forearm 
almost  entirely  for  his  stroke  and  watches  his  opponent  instead  of 
the  hall.  In  this  manner  his  placing  is  something  remarkable,  as  he 
waits  until  the  last  minute  before  striking  the  ball  and  then  with  a 
swift  short-arm  stroke  places  it  down  whichever  side  is  left  unguarded. 
The  fourth  set  was  a  battle  royal,  but  with  the  games  5/3  against 
him,  Vernon  succeeded  in  winning  four  straight  games  and  the  match, 
thereby  retaining  the  title  of  Missouri  Valley  Champion. 

In  the  doubles  the  cracks  again  had  had  easy  running  to  the  semi- 
final round,  where  Shelden  and  Vernon  met  Gleeson  and  Semple,  the 
Kansas  City  A.C.  pair  finally  winning,  6/4.  6/8,  6/1.  Carey*  and  Oil- 
man went  through  to  the  finals  in  a  comparatively  easy  manner,  but 
were  no  match  for  the  fast  Kansas  City  players,  Shelden  and  Vernon, 
vho  defeated  them.  6/2,  6/4,  6/1.  The  championship  round  between 
lames  and  .Tones,  holders,  and  Shelden  and  \  ernon,  challengers,  for  the 
Missouri  Valley  title,  was  almost  a  toss-up,  so  evenly  were  the  teams 
Hatched.  As  might  have  been  expected,  the  match' went  to  the  full 
ive  sets,  being  finally  won  by  .Tames  and  Jones,  6/3,  5/7.  6/3.  3/6,  6/3, 
vho  retain  the  championship  for  another  year.     The  summaries  :

Maryland  State  Open  Championship. 

The  invasion  of  a  number  of  the  foremost  of  the  younger  playerg  of 
the  North  into  Maryland  to  capture  the  State  Championship  gave  the 
tournament  an  unusual  importance  this  year.  Champion  Beals  C. 
Wright  attended  and  participated  but  only  in  the  doubles,  where  he 
was  paired  with  E  B.  Dewhurst,  and  wa«  defeated  by  Irving  Wright 
and  W^  C.  Grant  in  the  semi-final  round,  Wright  and  Grant  met  the 
Southern  pair.  B.  B.  V.  Lyon  and  Freddie  Colston,  in  the  final,  and 
in  turn  succumbed  in  two  of  three  sets  after  some  good  and  exciting 
play. 

The  defeat  of  the  visitors,  however,  was  revenged  in  the  singles, 
where  Robert  Leroy  succeeded  in  carrying  off  the  championship  after 
the  young  Northerners  had  made  a  pretty  clean  sweep  of  the  pre- 
libainaries.  The  second  round  found  Wright.  Dewhurst,  Grant  and 
Leroy  playing.  Leroy  played  and  defeated  Dewhurst.  The  other  three 
reached  the  semi-final  with  Basil  Wagner,  who  fell  a  victim  to  Grant, 
while  Leroy  disposed  of  Irving  Wright.  This  brought  Grant  against 
Leroy  in  the  final,  the  Columbia  champion  winning  in  straight  sets. 

The  summary  follows  :

to  gain  their  places,  their  matches  affording  plenty  of  excitement.  In 
the  Niles-Cole  match  the  former's  good  work  in  making  his  strokes  was 
astonishing.  Jf  Niles  keeps  at  the  game  a  great  future  is  in  store 
for  him. 

The  best  individual  tennis  was  in  the  Seaver-Bishop  match.  The 
way  Seaver  smashed  and  volleyed  was  a  caution  ;  his  play  lacked  any 
uncertainty. 

Seaver  constantly  passed  Bishop  at  the  net,  and  drove  down  the  side 
lines.     Bishop  was  completely  at  his  mercy. 

In  the  second  set  Bishop  looked  good  for  a  set  at  least,  getting  up 
from  love- 3  to  4-aIl  with  four  straight  games.  Seaver  got  the  set 
to  5/4,  and  then  Bishop  brought  it  to  games-all,  but  could  not  bring 
it  through.     Seaver  won  the  set,  7/5. 

C.  A.  Johnson  was  opposed  to  P.  L.  Miller,  and  the  latter  made  a 
splendid  battle.  He  was  fairly  steady,  and  took  advantage  of  his  op- 
ponent's mistakes.  However,  he  lost.  But  they  were  sets  that  kept 
Johnson's  friends  on  the  anxious  seat  for  a  long  time. 

In  the  match  between  H.  J.  Ilolt  and  J.  I.  B.  Larned,  the  Harvard 
crack,  it  was  Holt's  first  serious  effort  of  the  season.  In  Larned  he 
had  just  the  kind  of  man  to  draw  him  out,  Larned  being  all  over  the 
court  and  fairly  steady. 

Holt's  play  was  marked  with  considerable  dash,  and  when  the 
emergency  arose  he  was  there.  His  forehand  ground  stroke  was  as 
keen  as  ever,  and  he  worked  the  lines  with  effect.  Holt  won  the  set, 
6/4,   6/1. 

Seaver  drew  Niles  in  the  semi-final  and  Holt  met  Johnson.  The 
former  proved  a  magnificent  contest.  Seaver's  win  was  characteristic 
of  him,  he  displaying  wonderful  lasting  qualities  and  a  marked  steadi- 
ness and  truly  remarkable  getting  ability. 

Niles  played  the  more  brilliant  game,  earning  more  of  the  aces,  but 
his  effort  to  wear  Seaver  o^it  was  unavailing.  Niles  had  his  unsteady 
periods,  and  his  nets  and  outs  were  taken  full  advantage  of  by  Seaver. 
For  two  sets,  it  was  a  great  match.  Seaver  winning  the  first  set,  7/5, 
and  dropping  the  second,  5/7.  Tlie  third  appeared  just  a  test  of  en- 
durance and  the  interscholastic  man  did  not  have  enough  left  to  make 
the  win. 

The  other  semi-final  was  short  and  to  the  point.  Holt  having  no 
difiiculty.  playing  so  well  as  he  did  in  winning  from  C.  F.  .Johnson.  The 
match  did  not  take  so  much  out  of  Holt  as  the  othei  did  out  of  Seaver, 
and  Holt's  stock  for  the  final  went  up  appreciably. 

The  final  was  so  short  that  not  a  few  in  the  gallery,  who  were  look- 
ing for  a  long,  hard  battle,  were  taken  completely  by  surprise.  Seaver 
showed  the  effects  of  his  morning  play,  yet  he  went  at  his  task  with 
energy,  and  was  so  successful  as  to  keep  Holt  pretty  thoroughly  oft" 
his  game.  Holt  really  never  got  squarely  started,  and  only  once  did 
his  effort  appear  sustained. 

Holt's  service  during  the  tournament  had  a  marked  effect  in  bringing 
his  successes,  but  his  use  of  it  against  Seaver  had  no  effect,  for  the 
latter  met  it  every  time,  and  not  a  few  times  scored  clean  passes  off  it. 
Holt's  strokes  forehand  or  backhand  were  noticeably  short  and  only 
with  lobs  did  he  get  the  desired  length. 

Seaver's  play  was  very  steady,  and  his  mistakes  were  few.  He  was 
all  over  the  court,  and  it  was  hard  to  get  anything  to  his  forehand. 
His  best  effort  was  long,  deep  drives  from  back,  right  down  the  line, 
a  shot  which  by  his  method  of  making  it  left  his  opponent  in  doubt  as 
to  whether  it  was  a  lob  or  a  drive  that  was  coming.  He  also  success- 
fully passed  Holt  across. 

The  analysis  of  the  match  is  very  favorable  to  Seaver  in  every  way, 
he  scoring  33  earned  aces,  while  he  gave  away  but  27  on  error  shots. 
Holt  had  19  earned  shots,  and  made  35  errors,  21  outs  and  14  nets.

In  the  doubles  the  Harvard  pair,  Sulloway  and  Larned.  won  the 
championship.  Forty-two  pairs  entered  the  list.  Niles  and  Bishop  were 
the  favorites,  with  Ware  and  Fitz  second  choice,  while  Johnson  and 
Johnson  and  Sulloway  and  Larned  were  well  thought  of.  These  formed 
the  selections  for  the  semi-final,  the  matches  in  the  third  round,  result- 
ing in  their  survival  holding  keen  attention. 

The  team  work  of  Niles  and  Bishop  was  fine  and  their  play  at  the  net 
bordered  on  the  phenomenal.  In  that  position  they  were  practically 
invincible.  They  served  a  very  difficult  service  and  then  rushed  to  the 
net  for  the  return.  Serving  in  this  way  they  were  almost  sure  of 
winning  their  strokes. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  81 

Larned  and  Sulloway  showed  themselves  to  be  a  much  stronger  pair 
than  I'ier  and  Seaver.  They  won  their  match  in  straight  sets,  6/2,  6/4. 
Sulloway  put  up  a  fine  article  of  tennis,  using  force  and  accuracy 
through  the  match.  His  smasliing  won  him  many  points,  and  his  op- 
ponents had  a  wholesome  respect  for  his  drives.  Larned  backed  his 
partner  up  well.  Seaver  played  hard  to  win.  Pier  at  times  seemed  to 
play  carelessly. 

Another  good  contest  was  witnessed  between  Fitz  and  AVare  and 
Merrill  and  Khodes.  The  result  was  in  doubt  until  the  winning  point 
was  scored.  Tliere  were  extremely  long  rallies,  splendid  volleying  and 
in  fact  every  department  of  the  game  was  seen  at  its  perfection. 

The  semi-finals  produced  fine  tennis.  Of  the  two  events,  that  of 
Larned  and  Sulloway  vs.  Ware  and  Fitz  was  the  more  interesting. 
The  attack  of  the  winners  was  well  conceived  and  well  carried  out, 
although  at  times  Jieir  care  led  them  to  err.  whereas  their  usual  dash 
would  have  carried  them  through.  They  offered  a  diversified  attack, 
driving  a  great  deal  and  not  offering  the  lobbing  games  so  much,  which 
latter  would  be  more  to  their  opponents'  liking. 

The  bulk  of  the  work  fell  to  Larned,  for  the  attack  was  pointed  at 
him.  Except  when  anxiety  caused  unsteadiness,  he  played  splendidly, 
and  his  free  forehand  off  the  ground  got  him  repeated  earned  aces. 
Sulloway  played  m  grand  style,  and  his  cross-court  shots,  both  off  the 
ground  and  volleyed,  were  very  telling. 

Ware  bore  the  brunt  of  the  attack  for  his  team,  and  he  worked  hard, 
but  lacked  steam,  as  did  his  partner.  They  both  lobbed  skilfully,  but 
their  drives  were  not  effective,  and  they  had  extreme  difficulty  in  get- 
ting the  ball  by  their  opponents.     The  scores  : 

FIRST  SET. 

Larned    and    Sullowav    4     1     6     4     7     2     5     4     4— .37— 6

In  the  other  semi-final  match  Niles  and  Bishop  were  in  excellent 
form.  Throughout  the  winners  played  fine  tennis,  and  some  of  their 
strokes  were  models.  Their  judgment  was  faultless.  Their  opponents 
worked  hard,  but  at  times  could  not  seem  to  handle  the  difficult  shots 
sent  over  the  net.  The  playing  of  the  younger  Johnson  and  the  pretty 
shots  by  Niles  were  the  features  of  the  match.     The  scores  :

In  the  final  Larned  and  Sulloway  had  little  difficulty  in  establishing 
their  supremacy,  and  except  for  an  unsteady  period  in  the  third  set, 
which  they  lost,  they  played  a  remarkably  fine  gam^.  They  quickly 
solved  the  intricacies  of  their  opponents'  attack,  as  they  soon  found 
their  points  of  weakness,  and  then  they  proceeded  to  put  an  effective 
stop  to  their  adversaries'  efforts  to  advance. 

Larned  and  Sulloway.  once  settled  to  their  work,  were  the  personifica- 
tion of  steadiness,  and  their  assurance  went  a  long  way  in  making  their 
work  decisive. 


82  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

As  in  the  preceding  matclies,  Sulloway  was  an  important  factor  in 
the  win.  In  driving  from  the  ground,  in  volleying  and,  above  all,  in 
placing,  he  was  practically  absolutely  sure. 

Larned  was  not  far  behind  him,  though  his  effort  was  not  sustained 
so  long,  nor  so  often.  Service  played  a  big  part  in  the  result,  and  in 
this,  too,  Sulloway  had  the  honor.     The  summary  :

State  Championship  of  Tennessee. 

The  fi'rst  annual  tournament  for  the  Championship  of  Tennessee 
was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Nashville  Tennis  Club  during  the  week 
beginning-  July  31,  1905.  The  tournament  was  most  successful  in 
every  respect  and  the  interest  it  aroused  presages  a  large  entry  list 
for  1906. 

The  Rodgers  brothers,  of  Knoxville,  swept  all  before  them,  Cowan 
Rodgers  winning  the  singles  without  losing  a  set,  defeating  L.  D.  Scott, 
of  Atlanta,  in  the  finals.  6/2.  7/5,  6/2.  That  he  was  playing  in  great 
form  was  conclusively  demonstrated  a  week  later  in  Atlanta,  where 
he  won  the  Southern  Championship  from  a  large  entry  list.  Paired 
with  his  brother.  Charles,  he  also  took  the  championship  of  Tennessee 
in  doubles,  winning  from  Norman  Farrell,  Jr.,  and  Bradley  Walker,  of 
Nashville,    in    the   finals.   6/4,    6/.3,   7/5. 

TTie  Tennessee  tournament,  coming  as  it  does  the  week  before  the 
Southern  Championship  in  Atlanta,  offers  great  opportunities  for  get- 
ting into  condition  for  the  latter  event.  Cowan  Rodgers,  the  present 
Southern  Champion,  attributes  his  success  largely  to  the  practice  it 
gave  him.  This  year  (1906)  will  undoubtedly  see  a  large  and  repre- 
sentative list  of  Southern  players  at  Nashville  and  it  is  hoped  many  of 
the  northern  and  western  players.     The  result  of  the  play  follows  :

Minnesota  State  Championship. 

The  third  annual  tournament  for  the  Championship  of  Minnesota,  in 
singles  and  doubles,  was  held  at  Minneapolis,  on  the  turf  courts  of 
the  Miniivahda  Club,  during  the  second  weel<  in  August. 

Heavy  rains  interfered  materially  with  the  progress  of  the  tourna- 
ment, and  softened  the  courts  to  such  an  extent  that  the  play  was 
not  up  to  the  standard  in  past  tournaments. 

In  the  singles  the  defeats  of  H.  I.  Belden  by  J.  N.  Adams,  and 
G.  K.  Belden  by  T.  X.  Jayne  were  great  surprises.  In  the  upper  half 
Werner  had  little  difficulty  in  reaching  the  finals,  where  he  was  de- 
feated by  Jayne   in  a  four  set  match. 

The  Challenge  match  between  T.  N.  Jayne  and  W".  C.  Burton  (hold- 
er), was  exceedingly  close  during  the  first  two  sets — Burton  exper- 
iencing much  difficulty  in  handling  Jayne's  continuous  deep,  well  placed 
lobs.  With  the  score  five  all  in  the  second  set.  Burton,  by  careful, 
steady  playing,  won  the  next  14  games,  thus  retaining  the  title.  Score 
5/7,   7/5,   6/0,  6/0. 

The  double  tournament,  with  the  exception  of  the  unexpected  de- 
feat of  Burton  and  W^yman  by  Graves  and  Adams,  was  uninteresting. 
Belden  Brothers  again  proved  themselves  to  be  far  and  away  the  best 
team  in  the  State.

California  State  Championship. 

The  fifth  annual  tennis  tournament  for  the  men's  championship  of 
California  commenced  July  1  on  the  courts  of  the  Hotel  San  Rafael. 
The  feature  of  the  tournament  was  the  match  between  B^recl  Adams 
and  Percy  M'lrdocl^  in  the  second  round,  on  the  second  day  of  the 
tournament.  Murdock  easily  took  the  first  set.  6/3.  and  had  a  lead 
of  5/4  and  40-love  in  the  second,  when  a  high  forearm  drive  of 
Murdock's  service  gave  Adams  his  first  point  in  the  game.  With  the 
score  at  40-15  and  his  own  service  Murdock  seemed  to  have  the  match 
won.  Right  here  was  where  Adams  showed  class  and  grit.  He  did 
not  lost  heart,  but  kept  pounding  the  balls  from  one  side  line  to  the 
other.  With  one  lucky  drive,  which  touched  the  top  of  the  net  and 
a  cross-cut  smash,  he  evened  up  the  score  at  5-all.  It  seemed  to 
give  Adams  confidence  and  he  w^on  the  set  5/7.  The  third  and  de- 
ciding set  w'as   easy  for  Adams. 

The  play  finally  narrowed  down  to  a  contest  betw^een  Adams  and 
Harry  Rolfe  of  the  California  Club,  which  was  played  July  4.  Adams 
disposed  of  Rolfe  in  straight  sets,  and  as  Drummond  McGavin,  the

default.

Ward  Defeats  Whitman. — One  of  the  most  interesting  singles  games  played 
during  the  season  nccurred  at  the  opening  of  the  Orange  Lawn  Tennis  Club, 
when  Holcombe  Ward  defeated  M.  D.  Whitman  in  four  straight  sets.  Whit- 
man was  in  need  of  practice  and  it  told  in  the  final  sets,  but  in  the  second 
he  showed  flashes  of  his  old  brilliancy.  With  the  score  5-4  against  him,  he 
took  the  next  two  games  and  just  missed  winning  the  set,  when  a  rally  by 
Ward  made   the   score   even   and   scored   the  next   two   sets. 

Hotel  Wentworth  Tournament. — The  twenty-fourth  annual  tournament  at

scholastic  champion,  in  the  doubles.  In  working  out  the  semi-finals  in  the 
cup  singles  the  best  match  was  between  H.  C.  Johnson  and  L.  B.  Plimpton. 
Johnson,  playing  very  steady  tennis,  got  the  win,  and  in  two  sets  at  that. 
F.  J.  Sullow'ay  defeated  H.  H.  Whitman  in  straight  sets.  In  the  doubles, 
Sargent  and  Straw  earned  their  way  to  the  final  by  beating  I.  C.  Wright 
and  Rotch  'n  straight  sets,  and  then  were  forced  toi  surrender  to  Niles  and 
Sulloway   after  a   surprisingly   good   battle,    7/9,   6/4,    7/5,    6/2,. 


Davis  Cup  Team's  Round  Robin, — Some  of  the  play  in  the  preparation  of 
the  America  team  for  its  matches  abroad  was  followed  with  the  closest  at- 
tention during  the  early  season.  The  candidates  for  the  Davis  Cup  matches 
gathered  first  at  Norfolk,  where  for  ten  davs  they  played  daily  games  between 
themselves  and  against  leading  Southern  players.  These  were  mostly  infor- 
mal and  were  not  closely  followed  and  recorded,  but  a  series  of  invitation 
tournaments  succeeded  these  and  high  class  work  was  seen  in  them.  The 
play  at  Philadelphia,  for  instance,  in  the  Round  Robin  tournament  at  Man- 
heim  was  excellent.  In  the  first  dav's  play  Larned  met  Clothier  and  Ward 
played  Wright.  The  first  named  were  winners.  On  the  second  Ward  met 
defeat  at  Clothier's  hands  and  Larned  at  Wright's.  On  the  third  day, 
Larned  beat  Ward  and  Clothier  and  Wriarht  had  each  won  one  set  when  rain 
prevented  the  finish  of  the  match.  Clothier  won,  however,  in  the  deciding 
set  next  day.  This  left  Larned  and  Clothier  with  two  victories  and  one  de- 
feat each  and  they  met  in  a  deciding  match.  Larned  winning.  The  doubles 
resulted   in   an  easy  victory   for  Ward   and  Wright.

TOURNAMENTS 


New  York  Lawn  Tennis  Club 's  Tourney. 

After  winniim-  the  tonvnament  series  for  the  right  to  challenge  for 
the  title  honors  in  the  Manhattan  championship  doubles  from  Theo- 
dore Roosevelt  Pell  and  Harrv  Torrance,  the  Yale  pair,  Harold  H. 
Hackett  and  John  A.  Allen,  the  challengers,  finally  took  the  hand- 
some bowls  from  the  Princetonians,  Raymond  D.  Little  and  Frederick 
B.  Alexander,  the  defending  team.  The  contest  was  the  most  im- 
portant event  of  the  tournament  and  was  played  on  the  courts  of  the 
New  York  Lawn  Tennis  Club.  It  was  hotly  contested  through  five 
long  sets  before   Hackett   and  Allen  won  at   3/6,   3/6,   6/4,   6/2,  7/5. 

There  was  a  most  unsatisfactory  ending  to  the  final  match  in  the 
singles,  as  after  plaving  two  sets  nearlv  to  an  end  Harold  H.  Hackett, 
the  Yale  veteran,  defaulted  to  Frederick  G.  Anderson.  The  recorded 
score  of  the  match  was  6/2,  5/2,  defaulted.  After  declaring  his  for-

The  Metropolitan  Championship  Tournament. 

By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

The  Metropolitan  Championship  Tournament  of  190.5,  held  on  the 
courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  New  York,  brought  out  some 
clever  tennis  and  many  surprises.  The  first  match  in  the  preliminary 
round  between  Clarence  Ilobart  and  F.  B.  Alexander  was  exciting 
throughout  the  first  two  sets.  Hobart  won  the  first  handily,  and  led, 
5/4.  in  the  second,  which  Alexander  finally  w^on,  7/5.  Hobart  seemed 
to  tire  in  the   third,  which  Alexander  took  rather  easily. 

The  first  upset  occurred  in  the  second  round  match  between  R.  D. 
Little,  Metropolitan  champion  in  1901,  and  Harry  Torrance,  the  latter 
winning  in  straight  sets.  In  this  round  Anderson  played  a  three-set 
match  against  Alexander,  and  Burchard  defeated  J.  Family  Paret,  the 
veteran  player.  Paret  showed  little  of  his  old-time  form,  contenting 
himself  with  drawing  his  opponent  to  the  net  and  lobbing  continually. 
The  match  was  long  drawn  out,  and  after  each  had  won  a  set  had  to 
be  postponed  till  the  next  day,  when  Burchard  won  rather  easily. 

In  the  semi-final  round  Alexander  defeated  Mollenhauer  in  straight 
sets,  and  Burchard  surprised  his  friends  by  beating  II.  H.  Hackett, 
Metropolitan  chan>i)ion  in  1902,  in  a  well-played  three-set  match.  In 
the  final  round  Burchard's  Inability  to  handle  Alexander's  twist  service 
seemed  to  throw  him  off  the  rest  of  his  game  and  Alexander  won  rather 
easily.  6/0,  6/2.  6/0. 

There  was  no  challenge  round,  as  H.  Ward,  the  holder,  was  in 
England   on  the  American   tennis   team. 

The  doubles  were  uninteresting.  Alexander  and  Hackett  defeating 
all  their  opponents  with  ease. 

Miss  Bessie  Moore  defeated  Miss  Helen  Homans  in  the  finals  of  the 
ladies'  championship  in  a  well-played  and  interesting  three-set  match, 
after  being  within  a  point  of  losing. 

Ml-.  Anderson  and  Miss  Risch  won  the  mixed  doubles.

Inter-Mountain  Lawn  Tennis  Association  Tournament. 

Tlie  first  annual  tournament  of  the  newly  formed  Inter-Mountain 
Lawn  Tennis  Association  which  comprises  the  four  States  of  Utah, 
Idaho.  Wyoming,  and  Colorado,  with  headquarters  at  Salt  Lake  City, 
was  played  August  7  to  14,  on  the  fine  clay  courts  of  the  Fort  Doug- 
las Tennis  Club,  located  on  the  Military  Reservation  adjacent  to  Salt 
Lake  City.  The  clubhouse  of  the  Officers'  Mess,  Twenty-ninth  U.  S. 
Infantry,  is  located  beside  the  courts  of  the  Tennis  Club,  and  being 
thrown  open  by  the  officers  of  that  regiment  to  all  players,  contributed 
much  to  the  comfort  of  the  latter  and  to  the  pleasure  of  all  concerned. 

Fifty-four  (54)  entries  were  made,  including  all  local  players  of 
prominence  and  others  from  a  distance.  Among  the  latter  were  Mr. 
Samuel  Neel,  of  national  reputation  in  doubles,  and  Mr.  Reuben  G. 
Hunt,   of  California. 

Very  handsome  prizes  were  offered  by  the  Association.  The  first 
prize  in  gentlemen's  singles — the  Newhouse  Cup — was  won  by  Mr. 
R.  G.  Hunt.  The  runner-up  was  Mr.  Frank  T.  Roberts,  a  player  of 
local  prominence.  The  gentlemen's  doubles  were  won  by  the  Salisbury 
brothers,  two  leading  local  players.  One  of  these  brothers,  Mr.  James 
Salisbury,  has  held  the  State  championship  for  two  years,  and  was 
a  player  of  prominence  in  his  university — Cornell. 

The  ladies'  singles  were  w^on  by  Miss  Kate  Williams  ;  the  ladies' 
doubles  by  Miss  Williams  and  Miss  Humphreys. 

Mr.  Hunt,  in  addition  to  securing  "Hold  No.  1"  on  the  Newhouse 
Cup — which  must  be  won  three  times  before  passing  into  the  posses- 
sion of  any  player — was  given  a  handsome  gold  watch  in  recognition 
of  his  work  here,  and  as  a  souvenir  from  his  many  friends  newly  made. 
All  players  of  the  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  are  eligible  to 
compete  for  the  NewMiouse  Cup,  and  it  is  confidently  expected  that 
another  year  will  see  many  players  of  prominence,  new  to  this  section 
of  the  country,  entered  to  compete.

house  ;  vice-president,  Captain  Frank  D,  Ely,  Twenty-ninth  Infantry,

The  prospects  for  the  1906  tournament,  which  will  probably  be  held 
in  September,  are  splendid,  the  tennis  enthusiasm  being  phenomenal. 
Owing-  to  the  late  autumn,  in  that  section  of  the  country,  play  con- 
tinues until  into  December.      The  scores  :

was  played  at  the  Miller  courts  in  Salt  Lake  City.   September  1  to  3,

recently  been  played  there,  the  play  was  for  honors  in  singles  only. 
There  were  fourteen  entries,  the  winner  being  Mv.  James  Salisbury, 
the  1904  champion  who,  by  his  victory  over  Mr.  F.  T.  Roberts,  became 
the  possessor  of  the  beautiful  Schramm  cup. 

The  second  annual  open  tournament  of  the  F'ort  Douglas  Tennis 
Club  was  greatly  delayed  this  year  due  to  the  absence  from  that  post 
of  most  of  the  players.  The  tournament  was  for  men's  singles  only, 
and  was  played  off  November  17  and  18,  1905.  The  Fort  Douglas 
Cup  was  again  won  by  Mr.  F.  T.  Roberts,  the  1904  winner,  who,  by 
his  victory,  becomes  the  owner  of  this  neat  trophy. 

The  Fort  Douglas  Tennis  Club  was  one  of  the  prime  movers,  with 
the  Salt  Lake  City  clubs,  in  forming  the  Inter-Mountain  Lawn  Tennis 
Association.  The  officers  of  the  club  are  :  President,  Captain  Frank

capping was  unusually  good,  and  in  the  doubles  brought  out  some  re- 
markable racket  work.  The  event  was  won  by  Wylie  C.  Grant,  the 
ex-indoor  champion  and  international  winner  at  Homburg,  Germany,

112  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

East  Jersey  Lawn  Tennis  Association  Annual  Open 
Tournament,  1905. 

The  annual  open  tournament  of  the  East  Jersey  Lawn  Tennis  Asso- 
ciation for  the  East  Jersey  Challenge  Cup,  was  held  on  the  courts  of 
the  Elizabeth  Town  and  Country  Club,  Elizabeth,  N.  J.,  on  August  29, 
1905,  and  succeeding  days,  finishing  on  Labor  Day. 

The  entry  list  was  larger  and  more  representative  than  the  previous 
year  and  a'bove  the  average  as  to  class,  Elizabeth  being  so  near  New 
York  and  so  accessible  for  players  in  and  around  the  metropolitan 
district,  and  at  the  intersection  of  two  railroads.  The  enthusiasm 
displayed  by  the  crowds,  together  with  the  hospitality  extended  by 
the  club  to  the  visiting  players  and  their  friends,  more  than  made  up 
for  the  inclemency  of  the  weather,  which  to  a  certain  extent  inter- 
fered with  the  play.  ITae  condition  of  the  clay  courts  at  all  times 
reflected  great  credit  on  the  management. 

The  efficient  manner  in  which  the  Referee  handled  the  number  of 
matches  in  the  events,  notwithstanding  the  handicap  as  to  weather, 
enabled  the  finals  and  challenge  round  to  be  played  and  finished  on 
Labor  Day,  although  matches,  except  on  Saturdays  and  Labor  Day, 
were  not  started  before  3  P.  M. 

A  number  of  players  again  entered  this  year's  tournament,  who 
played  the  year  before,  and  it  is  the  aim  of  the  association  to  obtain 
a  representative  entry  list  each  year  so  that  the  contests  for  posses- 
sion of  the  East  Jersey  Challenge  Cup  will  continue  to  be  memorable 
ones,  and  the  honor  one  of  which  the  holder  of  the  cup  may  well 
be  proud. 

In  the  Challenge  Cup  Singles  Karl  H.  Behr,  who  has  shown  great 
Improvement  since  last  year,  having  triumphed  over  some  of  the  veteran 
cracks,  had  no  trouble  in  coming  through  to  the  finals.  In  the  other 
half  B.  B.  V.  Lyon  worked  through  and  vi^as  defeated  by  Behr  in  the 
final  round.  Greater  improvement  was  shown  in  the  playing  of  some 
of  the  local  players  in  the  singles  and  other  events. 

One  of  the  surprises  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  F.  G. 
Anderson,  the  former  winner  of  the  cup  in  1904,  by  Karl  H.  Behr,  in 
the  challenge  round.  In  the  early  part  of  the  match  Anderson  grad- 
ually forged  ahead,  but  by  steady  back  court  playing  Behr_^nally  after 
long  and  frequent  rallies,  in  spite  of  the  deep  base  and  side  line  shots 
of  Anderson,  wore  down  his  opponent  and  won  the  match  and  posses- 
sion of  the  cup  for  1905. 

In  the  men's  doubles,  Behr  and  Lyon  had  little  trouble  in  going 
through  although  there  were  about  thirty  teams  in  this  competition. 

In  the  mixed  doubles,  great  interest  was  shown  by  the  spectators 
as  evinced  by  the  applause  given  the  various  teams  during  their 
matches. 

Now  that  this  open  tournament  has  become  a  fi'xture  to  be  looked 
forward  to,  it  is  to  bei  hoped  that  this  Association  will  meet  with  the 
success  that  it  deserves,  and  also  the  players  who  follow  the  circuit 
will  each  year  swell  the  entry  list. 

The  following  were  the  scores  :

Hudson  River  Association  Tourney. 

Henry  A.  Torrance  of  the  Englewood  Field  Club  won  the  singles, 
ana  with  Alexander  Torrance  the  challenge  match  in  the  championship 
doubles  of  the  Hudson  River  Lawn  Tennis  Association.  As  defenders 
of  the  trophy  and  title  they  met  the  Princeton  foot  ball  veteran, 
hhepard  Homans,  who  was  paired  with  Herbert  Coppell,  and  de- 
feated the  latter  team  in  straight  sets  of  6/2,  6/2,  6/2.  In  the 
singles  Torrance  defeated  Ross  Burchard. 

The  volleying  tactics  of  the  defending  champions  in  the  doubles 
was  highly  spectacular.  At  all  points  they  outplayed  Homans  and 
Coppell,  who  during  the  first  games  vainly  tried  to  hold  to  a  position 
at  the  net.  It  was  fast  tennis  all  the  way  through  the  match,  but 
the  persistent  steadiness  and  hard  hitting  of  the  Torrance  brothers 
carried  them  through  to  the  second  holding  of  the  title. 

Another  of  the  Englewood  contingent,  Mrs.  Louis  S.  Coe,  gained  the 
title  in  the  women's  singles,  where  she  defeated  Mrst  W.  H.  Pouch, 
the  former  national  champion,  who  represents  the  Powelton  Country 
Club  With  Mrs.  D.  F.  Piatt  she  won  the  doubles  title,  while  in  the 
mixed  doubles  she  scored  a  third  victory  with  Shep  Homans.  Sum-

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  117 

Championship  of  Western  Pennsylvania. 

The  eighteenth  annual  lawn  tennis  tournament  for  the  Championship 
of  Western  Pennsylvania,  in  singles,  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
Pittsburg  Golf  Club,  on  jVIonday,  September  11,   and  following  days. 

The  Tournament  was  a  great  success  in  every  particular  and  tliere 
has  never  been  so  much  interest  taken  in  a  game  in  this  district  as 
was  shown  this  year.  This  was  especially  the  case,  as  the  cup  for  the 
Cliampionship  had  both  been  won  twice  by  C.  L.  Childs  and  T.  W. 
Stephens.  G.  D.  Edwards  also  had  one  leg  on  the  cup  but  E.  M. 
Meyers  of  Chicago  defeated  Edwards  in  the  semi-final  round  6/3, 
6/2.  In  tlie  fitials  C.  L.  Childs  defeated  Meyers  after  a  very  close  and 
interesting  match  by  a  score  of  6/4,  6/4,  6/3.  In  the  challenge  round 
there  was  a  great  amount  of  interest  and  enthusiasm,  as  whoever 
turned  out  to  be  the  winner  would  have  permanent  possession  of  the 
cup.  The  match  was  stubbornly  fought  throughout  and  brought  out 
the  best  tennis  that  has  been  seen  in  this  district  for  some  time. 
Childs  won  the  first  and  third  sets  and  Stephens  won  the  fourth. 
After  three  all  had  been  called  in  the  fifth  set  the  matcli  had  to  be 
called  on  account  of  darkness  and  the  contestants  agreed  to  start  the 
entire  match  over  on  the  following  Saturday.  The  largest  crowd  that 
has  ever  gathered  to  see  a  tennis  game  was  on  hand  to  witness  the 
final    Championship. 

Stephens  reversed  the  situation  and  won  the  first  and  third  sets 
and  the  fourth  set  was  four  all,  but  Childs  finally  pulled  out  the  set. 
When  three  games  all  was  called  in  the  fifth  set  the  excitement  was 
intense  and  the  strain  was  plainly  shown  on  tlie  players,  but  Childs 
by  a  wonderful  brace  won  the  three  remaining  games  and  the  match 
by  a  score  of  6/8,  6/2,  2/6,  6/4,  6/3,  and  thus  became  the  permanent 
owner  of  the  Challenge  Bowl. 

The  doubles  were  won  by  Messrs.  Childs  and  Edwards,  who  defeated 
Messrs.  Guyton  and  Canfield  in  the  finals  by  a  score  of  6/2,  6/3,  0/6, 
8/6.

Nyack  Country  Club  Tournament. 

The  annual  open  tennis  tournament  of  the  Nyack  Country  Club, 
Nyack,  N.  Y.,  scheduled  to  begin  on  Laboi*  Day,  September  4.  1905, 
was  not  commenced  until  the  afternoon  of  the  following  day,  owing 
to  stormy  weather,  but,  notwithstanding  the  loss  of  the  entire  day, 
the  committee  succeeded  in  running  the  tournament  off  without  inter- 
ruption and  to  a  successful  completion  on  the  following  Saturday. 
The  courts  have  a  reputation  for  being  of  the  best,  and  no  work  was 
spared  to  put  them  and  keep  them  up  to  the  highest*  standard.  As 
usual,  many  of  those  entered  visited  at  the  club  house  during  the 
week  ;  it  being  a  custom  of  the  club  to  extend  this  courtesy  to  all  con- 
testants. The  entry  list  was  large  and  with  such  a  calibre  of  players 
it  was  but  natural  that  there  should  be  many  exciting  matches. 

R.  C.  Seaver,  the  noted  Longwood  Cricket  Club  member,  was  looked 
upon  as  a  very  possible  winner,  and  his  many  friends  were  surprised 
at  his  defeat  in  the  semi-final  round  by  George  H.  INettleton  of  the  New 
Haven  Club  by  a  scoi'e  of  6/3,  6/3.  Although  the  score  does  not  indi- 
cate it,  this  was  one  of  the  most  interesting  matches  of  the  whole 
tournament.  Henry  Torrance,  .Jr..  of  the  Englewood  Field  Club  won 
tils  place  in  the  semi-final  round,  where  he  was  defeated  by  Mr.  Henry 
Mollenhauer  of  the  Kings  County  Club  in  a  hard-fought  match.  The 
-final  round  brought  Mollenhauer  and  Nettleton  to  the  opposite  sides 
of  the  net.  This  was  a  four-set  match,  and  it  was  by  his  nervy  play 
that  Mollenhauer  won.  TTie  scores  ran  to  deuce  repeatedly,  with'  many 
long  rallies.  By  defeating  Nettleton.  Mollenliauer  again  became  the 
challenger  for  the  $100  cup  held  by  his  club-mate.  Frederick  G.  Ander- 
son, who  had  won  it  twice  in  succession.  In  this  challenge  match 
which  lasted  four  sets.  Mollenhauer  showed  wonderful  speed  and  good 
judgment,  but  Anderson's  well  known  and  almost  unerring  placing 
■down  the  side  lines  finally  won  him  the  match  and  thus  the  challenge 
cup  became  his  personal  property.  There  will  be  another  men's  chal- 
lenge cup  put  up  for  the  1906  tournament. 

In  the  ladies'  singles.  Miss  Marie  \Vagner  showed  remarkable  play, 
and  she  will  doubtless  be  heard  from  in  the  champion  ranks  before  'a 
•great  while.  Mrs.  V>'.  H.  Pouch  was  the  winner  of  the  tournament 
and  played  Mrs.  L.  S.  Coe,  the  holder  of  the  challenge  cup,  and  de- 
feated her  after  a  very  interesting  match.  Mrs.  Pouch  now  becomes  the 
holder  of  the  ladies'  cup.  upon  which  alreadv  appear  the  names  of 
Miss  Elizabeth  H.  Moore  and  Mrs.  Louis  S.  Coe. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  119 

In  the  coDsolation  matcli,  Joseph  T.  McMahon  of  the  Kings  County 
Club  defeated  W.  C.  Alien  of  the  Knickerbocker  Field  Club,  6/2,  6/3, 
6/8,  6/1. 

The  feature  of  the  tournament  was  in  the  men's  doubles,  with  Lewis 
Perry  and  George  H.  Nettleton,  the  Longwood-New  Haven  team,  paired 
against  R.  C.  Seaver  and  Karl  H.  Behr,  the  Longwood-Yale  combina- 
tion. The  score  of  10/8,  13/11,  gives  some  idea  of  the  play,  and  it  was 
only  the  steady,  careful  and  accurate  play  of  Perry  and  Nettleton 
that  enabled  them  to  defeat  such  a  team  as  Seaver  and  Behr.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


INVITATION 
TOURNAMENTS 


Southampton's  Tournament. 

'riie  invitation  tournament  at  Soutliampton  attracted  its  usual  high 
class  entry  last  year,  including  many  of  the  leading  cracks.  Ward  and 
Wright  were  absent  and  Clothier  and  Larned  defaulted  in  the  opening 
round.  Edward  B.  Dewhuvst  of  the  University  of  Pennsylvania,  the 
ex-intercollegiate  champion,  divided  the  honors  of  the  first  day  with 
Frederick  G.  Anderson,  champion  of  the  Kings  County  Lawn  Tennis 
Club.  Both  played  liard  and  fast,  and  were  the  favorites  for  the 
honors.  Anderson  defeated  Wylie  C.  Grant  of  the  New  York  Lawn 
Tennis  Club,  and  while  the  Princeton  man,  Homans.  made  a  strong 
defense  against  the  attacking  game  of  Dewhurst,  the  P'ennsylvanian 
proved  the  better. 

The  ex-IIarvard  champion.  Edward  G.  Leonard,  showed  creditable 
form  and  so  did  tbe  Yale  champion,  Karl  Behr. 

Clarence  Ilobart  and  Richard  Stevens  did  not  show  to  advantage 
until  the  second  day  when  the  latter  put  Freddie  Colston  out  and 
Anderson  defeated  Stillman  and  Watson.  Robert  LeRoy  fell  a  victim 
to  Leonard  and  B.  B.  V.  Lyon  to  Behr,  while  Leonard  in  turn  went 
down  before  Behr. 

It  was  the  fourth  round  that  created  the  first  stir.  Anderson  put 
Harry  Allen  out  and  Stevens  defeated  Hobart.  Both  played  sterling 
tennis.  r)ewhurst  and  Behr  survived  and  these  four  entered  tlie  semi- 
final, which  promised  the  best  tennis  seen  in  tournament  up  to  the 
time  in  the  season  with  tlie  single  exception  of  Longwood. 

Stevens  found  Anderson  easy,  liowever,  in  their  match  and  won 
handily  by  G/1,  6/3,  while  Dewhurst  amazed  and  appalled  his  friends 
by  going  completely  to  pieces  and  losing  a  love  set  to  Behr.  He  rallied 
and  made  a  game  fight  for  the  second  set.  but  Behr  had  too  long  a 
lead  and  won  7/5.  Tlie  Yale  man.  however,  paid  the  penalty  in  the 
final  when  the  baseline  expert  simply  played  him  to  a  standstill  and 
won  tlie  honors  6/2    6/0,  6/1. 

The  doubles  gradually  resolved  tliemselves  into  a  contest  between 
Pell  and  Torrance  and  Allen  and  Anderson.  They  met  on  the  last  day 
and  played  a  fine  set  match  to  no  result.  Allen  and  Anderson  won  the 
second  and  third  sets  and  lost  the  first  and  fourth.  The  last  set  went 
twenty-four  games  without  issue,  darkness  ending  play  with  the  score 
12  to  12.  The  deadlock  was  broken  the  next  day  when  Torrance  and 
Pell  won  in  straight  sets. 

Allen  with  Miss  Koppe  won  the  mixed  doubles.     The  summary  :

a  few  discouraging  suiijrises.  Ward  defeated  Larned  in  the  first  day's 
p]a.v  handily,  while  M.  D.  Whitman  went  down  before  Beals  Wright

very  hard  sets  defeated  him.  Sixteen  games  were  played  in  the  final 
set,  ten  of  them  deuce  games.  Whitman  got  revenge  on  W^ard  in 
straight  sets,  for  his  previous  defeat,  the  latter  playing  very  inferior 
tennis.  In  the  doubles,  which  opened  the  same  afternoon,  Ward  and 
Wright  defeated  Larned  and  Whitman  handily.     The  scores  were  :

On  the  final  day  Wright  continued  his  splendid  work  and  added 
Ward  to  his  list  of  conquered,  after  losing  one  hard  set  by  some  re- 
markable ill  luck.  Larned  scored  in  straight  sets  over  Whitman, 
giving  W;*ight  an  easy  victory  for  first  honors  with  three  wins  and 
no  defeats  against  a  single  win  in  three  for  each  of  the  others.  Alex- 
ander and  Hackett  won  the  right  to  meet  W^ard  and  Wright  in  the 
doubles  over  Little  and  Fisher  in  two  of  three  sets.  The  scores

The  concluding  match  between  the  double  pairs  proved  sensational 
though  W:ard  and  Wright  won  in  three  of  five  sets,  3/6  ;  6/4  ;  6/3 ; 
2/6;  6/2. 

Only  the  splendid  team  work  of  the  champions  saved  them  from 
defeat,  as  Alexander  and  Hackett  played  a  rapid  volleying  game  that 
was  unusually  strong  and  aggressive.  Ward's  lobs  were  poor  at  the 
start  and  Hackett  and  Alexander  took  advantage  of  every  short  ball, 
killing  and  smashing  for  the  points  so  that  they  kept  on  even  terms 
with  their  opponents.  On  the  champions'  side  of  the  net,  Wright  played 
a  faultless  game,  and  at  the  end  his  support  of  W^ard  brought  about 
the  final  victory.

INTERCOLLEGIATE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 


Through  the  splendid  play  of  E.  B.  Dewhurst,  principally,  the  Uni- 
versity of  Pennsylvania  won  both  singles  and  doubles  titles  in  the 
Intercollegiate  championships,  played  on  the  courts  of  the  Philadelphia 
Cricket  Club  at  Wissahickon  Heights,  in  October.  In  both  singles  and 
doubles  Yale  was  the  contender  in  the  finals,  Karl  H.  Behr  carrying 
her  through  in  the  singles  and  Field  and  Wells  in  the  doubles.  The 
otlier  colleges  cut  some  figure  in  the  early  rounds,  but  were  eliminated 
lu  the  semi-finals. 

Princeton  showed  numerically  strong  in  the  first  rounds  of  the  sin- 
gles, bringing  through  three  representatives  to  Harvard's  two  and  one 
each  for  Yale.  Pennsylvania  and  W^illiams.  Thompson,  Randall  and 
Richardson,  the  Tiger  trio,  were  all  eliminated  in.  the  contest  for  the 
semi-final  play,  and  with  them  Smith  and  Williams.  Sulloway  and 
Whitman  came  through  for  Harvard,  but  both  were  outclassed  by  Behr 
and  Dewhurst.  The  Pennsylvania  man  had  command  at  all  times,  ex- 
cept in  the  second  set  in  the  final,  and  won  out  by  a  7/5  and  6/4 
victory  in  the   third  and  fourth  sets. 

In  the  doubles  match,  mated  with  Register,  who  supported  him  ex- 
cellently, Dewhurst  repeated  his  success.  The  real  contest  was  in  the 
semi-final  when  Behr  and  Spalding  of  Y'^ale  faced  the  Pennsylvania 
pair.  The  Quakers  won  in  straight  sets  after  Field  and  Wells  of  Yale 
had  disposed  of  the  other  Pennsylvania  double  team.  In  the  final  the 
New  Havenites  were  no  match  for  the  Red  and  Blue  players  and 
were  beaten  in  straight  sets,  the  last  a  deuce,  principally  through 
Pennsylvania's  carelessness.     The  summary  :

Harvard  Championship. 


Harvard  tennis  experts  who  witnessed  the  wonderful  playing  of  N.  W. 
Niles,  the  freshman  who  captured  the  Crimson  University  tennis  cham- 
pionship on  Jarvis  Field  during  the  last  week  in  October,  do  not  hesi- 
tate to  predict  that  the  boy  will  some  day  be  a  national  champion. 

Niles,  who  is  a  mere  stripling,  won  his  way  to  the  front  over  a  field 
of  110  competitors.  Included  among  the  number  were  members  of  the 
Harvard  tennis  team,  which  is  considered  the  best  in  the  country  ;  an 
ex-champion  of  Yale,  now  a  student  in  the  Harvard  Law  School  ;  and 
a  number  of  other  star  players.  Yet  in  the  five  matches  in  which  he 
played,  out  of  111  games  Niles  lost  only  23. 

For  two  years  Niles  has  not  only  been  Harvard  interscholastic  cham- 
pion, but  national  interscholastic  champion,  the  last  title  having  been 
earned  in  the  annual  tournment  at  Newport.  Hitherto  he  has  met  only 
schooll)()ys,  but  from  now  on  he  will  be  schooled  in  a  university  which 
has  turned  out  many  national  and  international  tennis  stars.

New  England  Intercollegiate  Championship. 

The  New  England  intercollegiate  tennis  championship  in  singles  at 
the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  was  won  by  Paul  R.  Fanning,  of  the 
Massachusetts  Institute  of  Teclmology,  while  the  doubles  championstiip 
event  was  again  taken  by  F.  R.  Smith  and  L.  Northrup  of  Williams, 
last  year's  winners.  As  the  result  of  the  semi-finals.  Wallis  of  Dart- 
mouth and  Fanning  of  Technology  were  left  in  the  singles  event,  and 
Smith  and  Northrup,  representing  W^illiams,  and  pulled  through  to  the 
finals  in  the  doubles,  together  with  W^se  and  Hanscom  of  Tufts. 

The  Dartmouth  pair.  Wallis  and  McLane,  gave  the  champions  a  very 
pretty  fight  in  their  half  of  the  semi-final  round  in  doubles,  and  came 
very  near  pulling  off  the  match.  After  each  had  a  set  the  games  were 
4-all  in  the  third  set.  The  Williams  team  then  braced  and  won  the 
next  two  games  and  the  set.  The  Tech.  pair  was  outplayed  by  the 
Tufts  from  start  to  finish. 

L.  F'anning  of  Technology,  however,  more  than  retrieved  his  team. 
He  and  Datewood  won  in  *^he  opening  round,  and  the  Williams  men, 
Northrup  and  Smith,  won  their  matches  easily.  Both  Dartmouth  play- 
ers won  their  contests,  and  Tobey  of  Bowdoin  and  Adams  of  Wesleyan 
were  the  other  winners. 

The  Williams  team  won  both  matches  in  the  second  round,  while 
W^allis,  after  a  hard  match  with  Adams  of  Wesleyan,  succeeded  in 
winning  in  the  gathering  darkness  after  three  long  deuce  sets.  Fanning 
also  had  a  hard  fight  to  win  over  Rotch  of  Dartmoutli. 

TTiough  both  Williams  men  thus  entered  the  semi-finals,  each  lost 
his  game.  Fanning  readily  disposed  of  Northrup.  but  Smith  gare 
Wallis  a  strong  fight  before  succumbing.  The  final  was  a  great  battle 
for  the  first  set,  but  he  shot  his  bolt,  and  the  next  two  sets  fell  easily 
to  the  champion.     The  summary  :

him  hard  fights.  In  the  final  he  met  R.  H.  Schoonmaker.  The  latter  later

finals.

WOMEN'S  NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 


In  the  Women's  National  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
Philadelphia  Cricket  Club  at  Wissahickon  Heights,  beginning  June  20, 
Miss  Bessie  Moore  came  into  her  own  again.  The  absence  of  Miss 
May  Sutton  in  England  gave  her  her  opportunity  and  she  cleverly  im- 
proved it.  A  big  Philadelphia  contingent  was  the  largest  percentage 
of  the  entry,  but  ^iiss  Neely  and  Miss  Homans  contested.  These  two 
came  through  to  the  semi-final,  with  Miss  Leroy  of  Philadelphia  and, 
of  course,  Miss  Moore.  In  two  easily  won  straight  sets,  Miss  Moore  and 
Miss  Neely  won  and  met  in  the  final,  where,  although  Miss  Homans 
made  a  good  contest  and  took  the  second  set.  Miss  Moore  won.  The 
absence  of  the  champion  gave  her  the  title  without  playing. 

In  the  women's  doubles.  Miss  Neely  and  Miss  Homans  playing  to- 
gether w^ere  irresistible.  They  disposed  of  Mrs.  Hobart  and  Miss 
Chase  in  the  first  round  and  met  Miss  Maule  and  Miss  Oberteuffer  in 
the  final.  Both  matches  they  won  in  straight  sets,  losing  only  one 
game. 

Mr.  and  Mrs.  Clarence  Hobart  took  the  mixed  doubles  title.  Miss 
Homans  and  H.  F.  Allen  gave  them  a  contest  in  the  semi-final,  but 
they  won  the  deciding  set  and  met  Miss  Moore  and  E.  B.  Dewhurst 
in  the  final.  The  latter  pair  succumbed  in  straight  sets.  The  men's 
singles  was  won  by  E.  B.  Dewhurst,  who  defeated  M.  B.  Colket  in  a 
hard  fought  match,  taking  the  deciding  game  rather  handily.  The

Miss  Sutton  an  International  Champion. 

The  remarkable  record  made  by  Miss  May  Sutton  during  her  sojourn 
in  England  will  be  long  remembered  by  devotees  of  the  game  on  both 
sides  of  the  Atlantic  and  by  the  admirers  of  the  wonderful  girl  player 
everywhere.  Her  victory  in  the  All-England  championship  is  by  far 
the  greatest  of  her  many  triumphs.  She  met  players  of  a  generally 
higher  grade  than  she  has  had  to  defeat  in  America  heretofore  and 
met  them  under  strange  conditions  of  play,  on  courts  that  were  new 
to  her  and  surrounded  by  crowds  that  might  readily  have  distracted  if 
not  dismayed  a  less  steady  player.  She  was  unfamiliar  with  the  styles 
of  the  various  competitors  she  had  to  face,  and  yet  she  came  through 
the  tournament  without  the  loss  of  a  single  set  and  played  in  the 
earlier  rounds  without  the  loss  of  a  single  game.  A  more  eloquent 
testimonial  to  lier  wonderful  skill  could  scarcely  be  framed  in  w(yds. 

In  the  first  round  she  met  and  defeated  Miss  N.  Meyer  in  love  sets  ; 
in  the  second  she  faced  Miss  Stawell  Brown  and  won.  6/3,  6/1.  in  the 
third  the  same  score  defeated  Miss  Longhurst  ;  and  the  fourth  saw 
Miss  E.  W.  Thompson  overcome  by  8/6,  6/1,  in  the  only  match  that 
threatened  her  with  defeat.  The  fifth  brought  against  her  Miss  A.  M. 
Morton,  and  6/4  and  a  love  set  won  the  victory,  while  in  the  final 
Miss  C.  Wilson  was  her  opponent.  After  winning  the  first  set  6/3, 
Miss  Sutton  appeared  not  to  exert  herself  after  getting  the  second  in 
hand  and  Miss  Wilson  was  able  to  bring  the  score  5-all,  before  Miss 
Sutton  aroused  herself  and  w'on  8/6.  In  the  challenge  round  she  won 
6/3,  6/4.  The  analysis  shows  Miss  Sutton  always  in  command,  while 
the  point  score  indicated  that  she  had  made  32  to  25  points  in  the 
first  and  36  to  32  in  the  second. 

As  a  matter  of  fact.  Miss  Douglass,  the  defending  holder  of  the 
title,  did  not  give  her  as  much  trouble  as  Miss  Wilson  in  the  final 
round,  or  as  Miss  Tliomson  in  the  first  set  of  an  earlier  round.  This 
was  more  the  misfortune  of  the  British  champion  than  her  fault. 

The  "top"  Miss  Sutton  manages  to  get  on  to  all  her  drives,  especially 
tliose  which  cross  the  net  at  an  oblique  angle,  is  an  asset  of  remark- 
able value,  and  time  after  time  the  spin  of  the  ball  deceived  her 
opponent  :  its  flying  off  at  a  tangent  almost  dismayed  her.  The  emi- 
nently safe  tactics  pursued  by  the  American  girl  also  aided  her  success 
materially.  She  strove  hard  all  through,  it  is  true,  but  was  content 
to  bide  her  time  eve  she  fiung  one  over  that  meant  either  an  ace  gained 
or  an  ace  just  lost.  Miss  Douglass  forfeited  many  points  by  excessive 
vigor  and  a  too  precipitate  idea  to  score  early  in  the  volley. 

After  she  led  5/1  in  the  first  set.  the  American  challenger  never 
looked  like  being  beaten,  and  although  the  English  holder  made  a 
plucky  effort  to  win  the  second  bout  after  her  opponent  was  5/2,  and 
actually  reduced  this  advantage  to  5/4,  she  was  not  equal  to  any  sus- 
tained recovery,  and  lost  the  day  by  two  sets  to  love,  6/3,  6/4. 


MISS    MAY    SUTTON, 
Winner  of  the  Pacific  Coast  Championship,  and  the  World's  Champion. 


142  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  analysis  of  the  match  shows  how  much  more  steady  Miss  Sutton 
was,  and  that  this,  with  her  superior  force,  won.  On  earned  aces  she 
and  Miss  Douglass  were  absolutely  level,  but  the  difference  in  the 
error  aces  tells  the  story.

FOREIGN   EVENTS 


America  in  the  English  Championships. 

After  America's  sweeping  victories  in  tlie  pi-eliminary  tournaments 
— tlie  men  in  the  London  cliampionsliips  and  at  the  Queen's  Club  and 
Miss  Sutton  in  the  northern  counties — all  England  began  to  fear  lest 
both  the  national  championships  and  the  Davis  cup  would  be  carried 
back  to  America.  Miss  Sutton  continued  her  remarkable  play  and  won 
handily,  with  only  one  or  two  hard  contests,  and  then  not  sufficiently 
close  to  cause  serious  worry  to  her  supporters,  but  the  men — the  least 
said  the  better. 

Brilliant  as  the  showing  of  Ward  and  AYright  had  been  in  the  earlier 
tourneys,  just  so  inferior  was  their  play  in  the  All-England  tourney. 
Wright  made  a  fight,  but  Ward  was  put  out  of  the  preliminary.  To  be 
sure  he  met  Smith,  but  the  caliber  of  his  play  was  fifth  rate.  Clothier 
and  Larned  stayed  with  Wright  to  the  fourth  round — Earned  to  the 
fifth,  in  fact,  but  all  save  Larned  were  beaten  by  inferior  men  playing 
inferior  games. 

The  championship  was  played  at  Wimbledon  and  attracted  the  biggest 
entry  ever  known.  Seventy-one  names  were  on  the  cards  for  the  big 
event,  including  players  from  America,  Australia,  Austria,  F'rance, 
Sweden,  Denmark,  Germany,  Spain.  Ireland,  New  Zealand  and  all  of 
England.     The  champions  of  six  countries  were  represented. 

All  the  luck  of  the  draw  went  to  the  Americans.  Wright  and  Clothier 
were  in  the  top  half.  Ward  and  Larned  in  the  bottom  division.  As 
pairs  in  the  doubles  the  Americans  drew  far  apart  and  equally  well. 

Ward,  however,  caught  S.  H.  Smith  in  his  first  round.  The  match 
came  forty-eight  hours  after  Ward  had  finished  a  hard  week  at  the 
Queen's  Club.  It  brought  about  the  first  of  a  series  of  heart-breaking 
disappointments  among  the  Americans.  Ward  was  in  wretched  form. 
He  did  not  even  win  a  set.  Smith  was  about  as  ugly  a  proposition  as 
Ward  could  have  drawn.  Not  even  H.  L.  Doherty  could  have  been 
better  fitted  to  beat  the  American  champion. 

Smith  had  a  great  forehand  "swipe."  made  from  the  very  top  of  the 
bound.  The  higher  the  bound  the  harder  Smith  hits.  Ward's  twist 
service  brings  forth  just  the  bound  Smith  likes.  Ward,  a  net  man, 
was  easy  for  Smith  on  this  service.  Ward's  great  strength  lies  in  his 
ability  to  run  in.  Smith's  hold  is  passing  just  such  a  man.  He  cut 
Ward  to  pieces.  6/4,  6/3.  8/6. 

Clothier  did  better  than  Ward  in  that  he  won  three  matches.  In  the 
fourth  round  he  met  Wilding,  the  New  Zealand  champion.  Clothier 
began  well.  He  won  the  first  two  sets,  7/5.  6/1.  Then,  with  one  more 
set  to  win,  he  went  to  pieces.  In  the  third  set  he  needed  two  points  to 
win  the  match  and  could  not  get  them.  He  also  had  several  fine 
opportunities  to  win  the  fifth  set,  but  lost,  10/8. 

Clothier  played  a  beautiful  game  in  volleys  and  was  cool  as  the  pro- 
verbial cucumber.  However,  the  Maori  stuck  to  him  with  wonderful 
pertinacity.  Wilding  had  a  splendid  service  and  excelled  in  his  driving. 
It  was  the  greatest  match  of  the  tourney  and  both  men  were  applauded 
to  the  limit. 

A.   W^   Gore,  who  had  been   defeated  by   Ward   during  the   previous

week  at  Queen's,  won  handily  from  Wright  in  the  fourth  round.  Gore, 
like  Smith,  is  a  great  base-line  player.  Wright  loves  the  net.  Hence, 
Gore  passed  him  with  continuous  hard  hitting.  Wright's  net  game  had 
no  chance.     Gore  won  6/2,  6/4,  7/9,  6/2. 

Larned  had  no  trouble  in  the  first  or  second  rounds.  In  the  third 
round  he  hooked  a  tarter  in  H.  A.  Parker  of  New  Zealand.  Ward  had 
eaten  up  Parker  at  the  Queen's  Club,  but  Larned  had  a  hard  time  beat- 
ing him  in  five  sets  at  Wimbledon.  In  the  fourth  round  Larned  met 
Smith,  who  had  defeated  Ward  in  the  first  round.  Smith  won  6/2, 
6/4,  6/4. 

This  disposed  of  all  the  Americans  in  the  All-England  championship. 
Brookes,  the  New  Zealander.  was  now  the  central  figure.  In  the  fifth 
round  he  defeated  F.  L.  Risley  of  England's  internationals  in  three 
straight  sets.  Then  he  downed  Gore  in  three  straight  sets  in  the  semi- 
finals. In  the  finals  he  put  up  a  tremendous  five-set  match  against 
Smith  and  won.  He  lost  the  first  set  1/6,  won  the  second  6/2,  the 
third  6/1,  lost  the  fourth  1/6,  and  won  the  fifth  7/5.  This  left  him  to 
meet  H.  L.  Doherty,  the  champion,  in  the  challenge  round.  Doherty 
once  more  proved  that  he  is  in  a  class  by  himself  by  beating  Brookes 
8/6,  6/2,  6/4. 

T'hirty-one  teams,  a  magnificent  entry,  appeared  for  the  doubles. 
Among  the  entrants  were  the  famous  Baddeley  twins,  for  many  years 
champions  of  England  in  doubles.  Here  the  Americans  did  better  than 
in  the  singles.  Ward  and  Wright  cantered  through  the  first  three 
rounds.  In  the  fourth  they  met  the  Baddelevs  and  won  in  a  hard  five- 
set  match.  6/2.  .3/6.  4/6.  6/1,  6/1.  Larned  and  Clothier  also  went 
through  in  slashing  style. 

The  semi-finals  saw  the  last  of  the  Americans.  Smith  and  Risley 
disposed  of  Ward  and  Wright,  while  Larned  and  Clothier  met  Brookes 
and  Dunlop,  the  Australian-New  Zealanders.  Both  American  teams 
went  down  in  dismal  fashion.  In  the  finals  Smith  and  Riseley,  the 
Britons,  beat  Brookes  and  Dunlop.  In  the  challenge  round,  however, 
the  Doherty  brothers  smothered  the  Englishmen  and  retained  the 
doubles  championship,  as  well  as  the  singles.  The  match  was  6/4,  6/4, 
6/8,  6/3. 

The  progress  of  the  play  is  best  shown  by  the  following  summaries  :

Americans  Win  London  Championships. 

Holcombe  Ward  and  Beals  C.  Wright  won  signal  honors  before  the 
final  test  matches  abroad  in  the  English  and  International  Champion- 
ships, at  serial  tourneys,  bnt  in  the  London  championship  they  met 
the  highest  clr^ss  of  competitors,  and  the  victory  scored  gave  proof  of 
their  true  merit.  Ward  and  Wright  played  tlirough  to  the  final,  when 
they  defaulted  to  save  both  for  the  doubles,  when  in  the  semi-finals 
they  met  their  fellow  team  mates.  Clothier  and  Larned,  and  won  from 
them.  TTie  only  pair  to  give  any  trouble  was  Brookes  and  Dunlop, 
the  Australians,  who  played  a  closer  game  than  the  score,  6/1,  9/7, 
6/3,  indicates.  The  match  in  which  Ward  met  and  defeated  M.  J. 
Ritchie,  the  holder,  was  the  best  the  American  played  abroad,  and 
Ritchie  had  small  chance,  losing  6/1,  6/1.  10/8.  In  the  same  round 
Wright  beat  C.  Wyllie,  6/3,  6/3,  6/3,  while  they  attained  their  po- 
sition in  the  semi-finals  bv  victories  over  Hall  and  McNair,  respec- 
tively. Ward  winning  6/1,  6/2,  6/4,  and  Wright  6/1,  6/3,  6/2. 

In  the  semi-finals  they  had  to  face  Gore  and  Brookes.  Both  made 
great  fights,  Brookes  beating  Wright  the  first  two  sets,  6/3  and  6/4, 
before  the  American  revealed  his  form,  when  he  took  straight  sets, 
4/6,  4/6,  1/6.  With  Ward  conditions  were  almost  reversed.  After 
winning  the  first  two  sets  from  Gore,  6/1  and  6/4,  he  lost  the  next 
two.  6/8  and  2/6,  but  took  the  final  6/4.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  I57 

The  Riviera  Tournament. 

By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

If  you  feel  seedy,  overworked  and  worried  and  desire  a  vacation, 
take  a  winter  trip  to  tlie  Riviera,  and  if  you  are  a  tennis  player  take 
your  bats  and  tennis  togs  over  with  you.  The  genial  Hon.  Secretary 
of  the  Nice  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  Mr.  Morganstern,  will  be  waiting  foi; 
you  with  open  arms. 

You  join  the  club  first  and  make  your  headquarters  at  Nice.  The 
first  tournament  comes  in  the  early  part  of  January  :  handicap  singles 
and  doubles.  Class  A  and  B,  in  the  singles,  so  that  it  matters  not 
whether  you  are  a  ranked  player  or  not.  you  have  your  fun.  Then 
comes  the  club  championship  for  the  handsome  challenge  cup.  If  you 
are  a  good  player  you  will  meet  such  noted  English  experts  as  Mr. 
J.  G.  Ritchie,  Messrs.  E.  R.  and  C.  G.  Allen.  There  are  also  handicap 
singles,  again  Class  A  and  B  ;  handicap  doubles,  handicap  mixed 
doubles,  ladies'  singles  and  ladies'  handicap  singles  ;  in  fact,  anything 
you  care  to  enter.  This  tournament  is  held  in  the  early  part  of 
February.  Immediately  afterward  are  held  the  championships  of  the 
Italian  Riviera  at  San.  Remo,  then  to  Menton  for  the  French  Riviera 
championship. 

All  this  time  make  your  headquarters  at  Nice.  Either  have  your 
own  motor  or  hire  one,  and  the  trip  over  the  world-famed  Corniche  to 
and  from  the  tourneys  will  repay  you  tenfold.  From  Menton  you  take 
in  the  famous  Monte  Carlo  tournament  on  the  courts  of  the  Hotel  de 
Paris.  Between  matches  there  you  can  wander  into  the  famous — or 
infamous — club  and  play  your  trente  at  quarante  as  easily  as  on  a 
tennis  court.  Mr.  Ch.  A.  Voight,  whom  you  have  probably  met  the 
summer  before  at  Hombourg,  will  point  out  the  notables,  and  if  you 
can  beat  II.  L.  Doherty  in  singles  and  H.  L.  and  R.  F.  Doherty  in  the 
doubles  you  will  have  your  name  carved  on  the  front  of  the  brownstone 
tennis  building. 

From  there  back  to  Nice  again  for  the  championships  of  Southern 
France.  There  again  you  will  meet  all  the  English  experts.  Altogether 
I  cannot  enthuse  enough  over  my  two  months'  tennis  trip  through  the 
Riviera. 

Harvard  Outclassed  Yale.— Harvard  outclassed  Yale  in  the  dual  tennis  meet 
played  on  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  courts  at  Longwood,  winning  five 
matches  to  one  in  singles  and  three  to  nothing  in  doubles.  In  the  nine 
matches  played,  Yale  won  but  three,  sets,  all  of  those  being  in  the  singles. 
The  best  match  of  the  day  was  between  Derham  of  Harvard  and  Porter  of 
Yale,  which  required  three  sets  before  the  Harvard  man  won.  The  play 
was  all  on  dirt  courts  and  at  times  the  rallies  were  very  spirited.  In  the 
doubles  Harvard  took  all  three  matches  in  straight  sets.  The  best  match 
was  that  between  Sulloway  and  La  rued,  Harvard,  and  Behr  and  Bodman, 
Yale,   in  which   the  last  set  ran   to  deuce. 

Gordon  Won  Princeton's  Interscholastic  Tournament.— Spencer  Goidon  of 
the  Western  High  School,  Washington,  D.  C,  won  Princeton's  thirteenth  an- 
nual interscholastic  tennis  tournament  by  remarkable  play  in  the  finals. 
Seven  schools  sent  representatives:  Newark  Academy,  St.  Paul,  Lawrence- 
ville.  Princeton  Prep.,  Rand  Collegiate  School,  St.  Paul  of  Garden  City  and 
the  Western  High  School  of  Washington.  The  great  surprise  of  the  tour- 
nament was  the  easy  manner  in  which  Gordon  defeated  Partridge,  who  holds 
the  title  of  Yale  interscholastic  champion.  The  final  match,  between  Gordon 
and  Hewitt  of  Princeton  Prep.,  was  very  exciting,  but  neither  player  could 
put  up  his  best  game  due  to  exhaustion,  as  each  had  gone  through  three 
previous  matches.  By  good  headwork,  Gordon  yielded  the  second  set.  mak- 
ing the  score  one-all,  and  saved  himself  for  the  last,  in  which  he  showed  up 
to   advantage;   the   score  being  6/4.    1/6,   6/4.

NATIONAL  INDOOR 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 


By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

The  seventh  annual  indoor  championship  was  begun  on  February  20, 
1906,  on  the  board  courts  in  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory,  New  York. 
The  tournament  attracted  twenty-one  entries  in  singles  and  ten  in 
doubles.  The  list  was  of  a  high-class  order.  In  the  singles  the 
reapDearance  in  tournament  play  of  E.  P.  Fischer,  the  ex-national 
champion,  was  the  feature. 

The  preliminary  round  brought  out  no  upsets  and  only  indifferent 
play.  In  the  first  round  Tallant  fairly  walked  through  W.  B.  Cragin, 
one  of  the  regimental  cracks.  Fischer  defeated  I.  C.  Wright  in  a 
clever  three-set  match,  and  R.  T.  Bryan  defeated  H.  F.  Allen  easily, 
Allen  being  badly  out  of  practice. 

The  second  round  brought  out  an  upset.  H.  L.  Westfall,  the  young 
Brooklyn  player,  earned  a  very  creditable  victory  from  Hugh  Tallant, 
the  Harvard  veteran.  Westfall  is  only  eighteen  years  old,  and  though 
lacking  in  the  fine  points  of  the  game  needs  only  experience  and  more 
finish  to  his  stroke  to  become  a  factor  in  the  large  tournaments. 
Grant  defeated  Bryan  much  more  easily  than  anyone  expected,  and 
Pell  had  some  difficulty  with  Clark,  while  Fischer  defeated  Westfall 
in  a  rather  unpleasant  match,  the  poor  lining  working  on  the  feelings 
of  the  younger  player  who  was  visibly  upset  by  the  bad  dimensions. 
In  the  other  semi-final  Grant  defeated  Pell  in  straight  sets.  The  only 
remarkable  feature  of  the  final  match  for  the  championship  between 
Grant  and  Fischer  was  the  splendid  service  of  Grant,  who  made  ace 
after  ace  on  his  older  opponent.  TTie  bad  light  in  the  armory  seemed 
to  affect  Fischer,  and  his  volleying  was  far  below  par.  Grant,  on  the 
other  hand,  played  a  steady  consistent  game  and  won  out  in  straight 
sets,  the  last  one  being  8/10. 

The  best  match  in  the  men's  doubles  was  the  semi-final  between 
Grant  and  I.  C.  W^right  and  Fischer  and  Tallant.  the  former  pair 
winning  in  two  straight  interesting  sets.  Wright  was  the  star,  his 
crosscourt  volleys  being  particularly  effective.  Hackett  and  Alexander 
went  through  the  tournament  without  losing  a  set. 

The  committee  in  charge  deserve  a  great  deal  of  credit  for  their 
excellent   management.     The   scores  :

Indoor  Tournament  at  St.  Nicholas  Rink,  New  York. 

The  results  in  the  indoor  games  at  St,  Nicholas  rink  exceeded  the 
expectation  of  even  the  most  sanguine  of  its  projectors.  The  move 
ment,  which  had  its  inception  in  a  mere  desire  to  provide  a  pastime. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  163 

developed  into  a  serious  tournament  that  produced  keen  rivalry  and 
some  excellent  play.  The  showing  of  Ward  and  W^right  in  the  men's 
doubles  was  unusually  high  class  for  the  season  of  the  year  and  was 
easily  better  than  that  of  any  of  the  other  teams  entered.  The  sur- 
prise of  the  week  was  the  defeat  of  the  Wrenn  boys  bv  Grant  and  Dew- 
hurst  and  their  entry  thus  into  the  finals.  Against  Ward  and  Wright 
they  were  outclassed  from  the  start  and  lost  three  straight  sets. 

The  defeat  of  the  Wrenns  was  undoubtedly  due  primarily  to  their 
poor  form.  IS  either  of  them  showed  anything  like  their  game,  while 
Grant  and  Dewhurst  played  almost  up  to  their  top  notch.  The  young- 
sters are  a  good  pair,  but  have  a  long  distance  to  go  before  they  can 
hope  to  meet  on  an  even  basis  a  team  of  the  Wrenn  stripe. 

The  preliminary  round  disposed  of  the  weaker  teams  readily,  while 
Ward  and  Wright  put  Little  and  Alexander  out  of  it  in  straight  sets. 
The  Wrenns'  defeat  brought  Grant  and  Dewhurst  against  the  champions 
at  the  finish  with  the  result  recorded  above. 

The  other  tournaments  developed  interest  primarily  in  the  showing 
of  the  two  Boston  girls  who  figured  so  prominently  in  the  women's 
doubles.  Miss  F'enno  and  Miss  Sears  showed  a  marked  superiority 
over  their  opponents  in  every  match  they  played,  losing  only  one  set, 
that  to  Miss  Barger  and  Mrs.  Wallach.  At  no  time  did  they  seem  to 
be  in  trouble  and  they  handled  themselves  in  a  way  that  promises  even 
better  things  of  them.  They  are  far  from  the  first  flight  of  women 
players  as  yet,  but  this  in  no  wise  discredits  their  performance. 

In  the  mixed  doubles  they  were  successful  with  the  Wrenn  boys 
and  were  opposed  by  each  other  in  the  finals.  Miss  Sears  winning  with 
Bob  Wrenn  after  a  spirited  contest.  The  results  in  the  various  matches 
follows  : 

CHAMPIONSHIP  WOMEN'S  DOUBLES— CLASS  A.

and  Miss  Marie  Winthrop,  6/3,  6/3;  Miss  Katharine  Barney  and  Miss

INTER-CITY  W^OMEN'S  DOUBLES. 

Miss  Marion  Fenno  and  Miss  Eleanor  Sears  won  the  Inter-city 
Women's  doubles  by  hard  hitting,  good  service  and  superior  net  work. 
They  followed  their  service  to  the  net  and  smashed  and  killed  with 
good  effect.  In  deep  court  play  only  were  they  deficient,  their  returns 
of  long  drives  being  very  erratic  at  times.  Their  ability  to  get  up  to 
the  net  saved  them  the  necessity  of  exhibiting  this  weakness  often. 
The  Newport  team  showed  rather  better'  than  the  other  pairs.  The 
scores  were  : 

Semi-final  round — Miss  Marion  Fenno  and  Miss  Eleanor  Sears,  of  Boston,  de- 
feated Mrs.  Barger  Wallach  and  Miss  Edna  Barger,  of  Newport,  6/8,  6/4, 
6/3;  Miss  Juliet  Adee  and  Miss  Martha  Coster,  of  New  Yorli,  defeated 
Miss  Katharine  Barney  and  Miss  Gertrude  Pell,  of  Philadelphia.  6/1,  6/3. 
Final  round — Miss  Marion  Fenno  and  Miss  Eleanor  Sears,  of  Boston,  defeated 
Miss  Juliet  Adee  snd  Miss  Martha  Coster,  of  New  Yorli,  6/3,   6/4. 

The  superiority  of  the  Boston  women  turned  the  scales  in  the  mixed 
doubles  against  their  opponents.     With  the   Wrenns  as   partners   they

'    13.     A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
ounts  for  nothing. 

14.  TTie  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it  has 
[iouched  the  ground. 

i    15.     A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law  8,  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net ;  but  a 
5ervice,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 
k'  17,  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  sei"vice, 
-OP  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return 
the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
^aent's  court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 


168  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu- 
tive faults  ;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play  ;  or  if  he  return 
the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court ;  or  if 
he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by  law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  anything" 
that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking ;  or 
if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once  ;  or  if  he  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in  play  ;  or  if  he  volley 
the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a  permanent 
fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is  called  15 
for  that  player ;  on  either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the 
score  is  called  30  for  that  player  ;  on  either  player  winning  his  third 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player  ;  and  the  fourth  stroke 
won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for  the  player,  except  as  below. 
If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and 
the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  tha-t 
player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set ;  except  as 
below:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games  all; 
and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for 
that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  tlie 
score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of 
each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even.  It  shall, 
however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
change  sides  instead  at  the   end  of  every   set  until   the  odd  and  con- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  169 

eluding  set,  in  wtiich  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded ;  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points  ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous  score  shall 
hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour,  the 
player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
stay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  when  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistalie  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who  ought  to 
have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  in  the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
banded  games,  except  as  below : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall 
be  36  feet  in  width;  4%  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and  L  N.  The  service 
lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which  they  meet  the  service 
side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve  iu 
every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to  serve 
in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so.  and  the  op- 
posing pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third, 
and  the   partner  of  the  player  who   served   in  the  second  game  shall 


*  All  roatches  In  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  under  the 
auspices  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  shall  be  the  best 
two  in  three  sets,  with  a  rest  not  exceeding  seven  minutes  after  the  second 
set. 


170 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  in  all  the 
subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

31.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set,  either  partner  of  the  pair 
which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve  ;  and  the 
same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second  game  of  the  new 
set. 

32.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout  the 
game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  partner ; 
and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established  shall  not 
be  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  courts  to  receive  the 
service,  till  the  end  of  the  set. 

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  between  the  service 
line,  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  as  provided  in 
law  35,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he  wears  or 
carries.

DECISIONS  ON 
DOUBTFUL  POINTS 


Officially  recognized  hy  the  U.  8.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

I.  A  player  standing  outside  the  court  volleys  the  ball  or  catches 
it  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

II.  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count? 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.  If  he  attempts  to  return  the  service  he  is 
deemed  ready. 

IV.  The  striker-out  calls  "not  ready,"  for  a  second  service.  The 
ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out  claims  that  the 
fact  that  he  was  not  ready  makes  no  difference,  since  a  fault  cannot 
be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — The  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  player 
cannot  call  "Not  ready,"  and  then  have  the  service  count,  or 
not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds  back  into  the 
court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 
it  before  it  fall.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  so? 

Decision. — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — 'Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  173 

VIII.  A  playei-'s  racket  slips  out  of  his  liand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose   the  stroke  for  hitting  the  netV 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  iiot. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  over  the  net.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Dcctsl07i. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in 
a  player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unques- 
tionably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.  A 
player  touches  the  net  beyond  the  inside  posts,  and  claims  that  he 
does  not  lose  the  stroke  because  there  should  be  no  net  more  than 
three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  tlie  net,  jumps  over  it.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  ou 
opposite  sides  of  t'j-e  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading 
his  opponent's  court   loses  the   stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
net   and  bounds   into   the   opposite   court. 

Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  Tlie  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the 
court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is   returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary? 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  return 
the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Y'es,  if,  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  controL     For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is   interfered   with   by    them,    the   stroke   should   not   be   played 
again,   because   the   ropes  and   seats  form  part   of  the   arrange- 
ments of  the  ground.     If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,   or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and    so   interferes  with   a   player,   the   stroke   should   be   played 
again. 
XVIT.     A  player  Is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the   stroke   to   be   played  again.     Tlie   server   had   previously   served  a 
fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 


174  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  riglit 
court  under  all   circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  From  which  court 
should  he  serve  next? 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  sei-vice,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being 
thirty-fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke, 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  is 
simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  play- 
ers to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  won, 
when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.  What 
is  to  be  done? 

Decision. — Tlie  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that  the 
umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find 
that  the  umpire  has   called   "play."     Has  he  any   redress? 

Decision. — Iso. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
change  his  decision. 

Decision. — Ttie  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
fall.     He  then  claims  to  have  the   stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 

XXVI.  The  ball  strikes  the  ground  close  to  a  line ;  the  scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.  On  appeal  to  the  linesman,  the 
latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands? 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  175 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  tlie  bottom  of  the 
net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  ia 
plaj'  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault? 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is 
his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Decision. — No. 


UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 

(From  Lawn  Tennis.) 

Both  of  the  opponents  of  the  servers  in  doubles  are  strikers-out 
alternately  during  a  game.  It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  throughout  each  set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that  ulti- 
mately falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch  it  in 
doing  so. 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  not 
touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
please  ;  it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits  of  the 
side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the  point  ha» 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net,  and  nothing 
which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good ; 
it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court :  he  may 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 


176  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net  after 
having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  The  point  counts 
in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net  in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  the  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  tlie  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  hall  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
hits  him.   or  not. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court, 
and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  an^  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  Winning  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  does  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts  ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in  the 
matter ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  lie  returns  it.

ber of  the  Committee  or  an  Umpire,  to  disqualify  the  offender,  and 
further  to  order  him  off  the  ground,  should  his  misconduct  appear  to 
them  to  iustify  such  action,  but  before  such  action  shall  be  taken,  an 
opportunity  of  offering  an  explanation  shall  be  afforded  to  the  com- 
petitor whose  misconduct  has  been  reported  to  them.

fuse to  play  (unless  he  has  been  formally  excused  for  a  definite  period 
by  the  Referee),  or  shall  have  given  previous  notice  to  the  Referee, 
or  a  member  of  the  Committee  that  he  cannot  play  in  his  next  round, 
his  adversary  shall  win  in  that  round. 

19.  In  handicap  matches  the  competitors  shall  be  handicapped  by 
the  Committee,  or  by  a  Handicapper  appointed  by  the  Committee. 

20.  The  method  of  handicapping  shall  be  by  classes  as  follows:

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  0,  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered in  great  (say  more  than  30).  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing 
odds)    should  be  classified  as  follows  :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  185 

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table.  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fi'g- 
ures  at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line   of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  1.5  and  1-6  of 
15),   the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not.  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.     In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  26  must  be  strictly  observed. 


INSTRUCTIONS    FOR    HANDICAPPING. 

GIVEN    ODDS. 

One-sixth  of  fifteen  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  given  by  the  better  to  the 
poorer  player  on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth  and  every  subsequent 
sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  of  fifteen  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second,  fourth, 
eighth,   tenth    and   corresponding  games  in  each   set. 

Three-sixths  of  fifteen  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the 
second,  fourth,  sixth  and  every  other  alternate  game  on  each  set. 

Four-sixths  of  fifteen  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  sixth,  eighth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  corresponding  games 
on  each  set. 

Five-sixths  of  fifteen  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second,  third, 
fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  corre- 
sponding games  on  each  set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  given  on  every  game  of  each  set. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same  games 
as  for  one-sixth,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  two-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty)  is  two  strokes  given 
on  the  same  games  as  for  three-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 

Fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  four-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  is  two  strokes  on  the  same  games  as 
for  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Thirty    (30)    is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1).  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty 
and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4), 
thirty  and  fiVe-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  are  three  strokes  and 
two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen 
series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  oddsi  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  ^^.me  quanti- 
ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  \s  caquired  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  plaver  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts. 
TTiese  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds

188  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds  : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
sixth  and  corresponding  games   in   each   set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2).  fifteen 
and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  according  to 
the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  iDlayers  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may  be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it.  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  given  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and"^  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  tlie  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases. 


HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  fi'rst  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  tournament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
official   sanction  for  the   tournament,   stating  dates  and   other  partieu- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  189 

lars.  If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  Be  of  any  value 
A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee! 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  • 
(3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  • 

(5)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee;  and 

(6)  the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
'due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  Jo  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
"Tournament    Regulations."   page  177). 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  on  prizes, 
for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
lawn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
change, and  therefore  not  engraved  until   after  the  tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
well  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
T'he  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
There  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  either,  particularly  on  the  south  side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
seeing  that  they   are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  club 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
cakes  and  'sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players  and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent.

HOW  TO  BUILD  AND 
KEEP  A  COURT 


Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  how  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  grovmd,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,  light  and  drainage. 

The  bacli-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  from 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it.  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60  x  120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  m.ore  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one  netting  can  surround  all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  .  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end,  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
Mh  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  drain  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in,  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain -pipes  are  put  in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  191 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use,  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  one 
foot  if  no  drains  are  required.  After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 
level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  right,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  broken 
stone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  egg,  will  answer 
the  purpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  layer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  stone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  is 
put  on  the  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly  level,  or,  rather  that  the  center  of  it  is  not 
more  than  one  inch  lower  than  at  the  ends.  Any  holes  or  depressions 
that  appear  from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is 
covered. 

Evei-y  well-built  court  should  be  graded  toward  the  net,  and  a  drain- 
pipe, well  protected  with  broken  stone  should  be  sunk  at  right  angles 
to  the  court,  dividing  it  in  halves  at  the  net.  Toward  this  gutter  the 
surface  of  the  court  should  be  drained  and  the  drain-pipe  in  turn 
should  be  tilted  enough  to  carry  the  water  to  one  side  well  off  the 
grounds,  into  some  lower  spot,  or  be  connected  with  some  sunken 
hogshead  or  regular  sewer.  A  surface  grade  of  one  inch  is  enough 
to  keep  the  average  court  dry.  The  base  lines  therefore  should  be 
one  inch  higher  than  the  ground  at  the  net,  and  if  the  soil  is 
sandy  enough  to  take  up  most  of  the  water  from  the  average  rain- 
storm, no  drain  but  that  under  the  net  will  be  necessary.  Some  players 
prefer  the  court  to  drain  from  end  to  end,  in  which  case  the  court  should 
grade  gradually  so  that  one  end  is  two  inches  lower  than  the  other. 

If  artificial  drainage  is  necessary  to  keep  the  court  dry,  drain-pipes 
can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the  court.  This  can  be  done  by  get- 
ting six-inch  stone  sewer-pipes  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters  used  on 
tiled  roofs,  and  sinking  them  in  the  ground,  open  side  up,  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock.  Two  or  three  should  be  placed 
on  each  side  of  the  net,  parallel  with  the  side-lines  and  graded  down 
toward  the  center  gutter  under  the  net.  These  pipes  should  be  filled 
with  coarse  pebbles  or  cracked  stones  about  the  size  of  walnuts,  and 
they  keep  the  drains  from  filling  up  with  earth.  The  water  will  then 
trickle  through  the  coarse  sand  and  stones  to  the  pipes  and  be  carried 
down  to  the  main  gutter  and  soi  off  the   court. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  be  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  six  inches  in  thicl^ness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  two  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
four  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if  it 
is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  ;  while  if 
it  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  too  long  after  rain,  or  its  surface  is 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  When    a    court   is    finally   covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 

watered  and  rolled  alternately  twice  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
is  played  on  at  all.  and  any  depressions  or  uneven  spots  corrected  as 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  After  the  first  heavy  rain- 
storm it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
it  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The   fine   seashore    sand   will    seldom   be   found   satisfactory   for   the 


192  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

surface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly'  under  the  players' 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  drainage  more  difficult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very  rich  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to  the  surface.  It  is  also  well  to  use  coarse 
sifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  he  considered,  it  should  be  built 
by  a  professional,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations  ;  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  should  first  be  care- 
fully removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  by  100  feet,  cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen, 
inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the' 
earth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavy  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  much  leveling  and  rolling, 
and  the  rolling  should  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by  rain  or  hose-pipe.  Any  inequalities  which  the  heavy  pres- 
sure of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cut  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  sufficiently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sod^  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  TTie  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again  ;  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 
upon  until  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  If 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  that  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted-.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way.  but  it  will  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  midd,le  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet,.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sycle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use.  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
weather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  I93 

The  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
cue  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  Mnes  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

There  are  several  other  kinds  of  courts  sometimes  built  when  turf 
cannot  be  had.  Cinders,  clay,  concrete,  cement  and  asphalt  are  also 
sometimes  used,  while  board  courts  are  built  undercover  for  winter  use. 

Concrete  and  cement  are  open  to  many  objections.  They  are  very 
hard  on  the  eyes  and  legs,  and  often  make  the  player's  feet  sore  ;  the 
surface  generally  wears  out  the  balls  and  shoes  quickly,  and  it  is  also 
liable  to  crack  with  frost.  Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  con- 
struct, but  the  surface  is  so.  gritty  that  it  burns  the  feet  of  the  players 
and  soon  uses  up  the  balls.  They  are  also  very  dirty.  Asphalt  courts 
are  expensive  and  much  affected  by  heat  and  cold,  sometimes  even 
cracking  with  the  frost. 

In  Australia  courts  have  been  made  of  cracked  blue-stone,  while  a 
cheaper  substitute  has  been  found  in  England  in  what  is  called  a  brick 
rubble   court. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.  In  every  case,  unless  it  be  of  grass,  and  the  lines  are 
to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  forty  feet  apart. 

A  double  court  contains  every  line  used  for  singles,  and  so  it  is 
customary  to  mark  a  court  for  doubles,  except  occasionally  for  im- 
ported tournament  matches  in  singles,  when  the  outside  lines  are  left 
off.  In  order  to  lay  out  a  court  properly  the  middle  of  the  space 
should  be  measured  and  the  two  posts  set  down  for  the  net.  Then 
cord  should  be  stretched  along  one  side  .iust  inside  the  post  and  pegs 
driven  down  into  the  ground  each  39  feet  from  the,  net.  In  order  to 
prove  that  the  side-lines  are  at  right  angles  with  the  line  of  the  posts 
where  the  net  is  to  cross  it  should  be  proved  by  measuring  with  a 
tape-line  or  cord  the  diagonals  from  the  opposite  net-post  to  the  corner 
peg  at  each  end  of  the  side-line,  which  should  agree. 

The  pegs  from  the  other  two  corners  should  be  driven  down  next 
|jy  measuring  36  feet  at  right  angles  from  each  end  of  the  side-line 
already  planned.  Then  you  have  a  hollow  square,  but  before  marking 
any  of  the  lines  it  should  be  proved  again.  The  long  diagonals,  from 
corner  to  corner,  should  be  carefr'.iy  measured  to  agree,  in  order  that 
the  court  shall  be  exactly  rectangular,  not  diamond  shaped.  Each  side- 
line and  each  base-line  should  be  gone  over  again  to  prove  its  length 
accurate,  and  then  the  lines  of  this  hollow  square  should  be  marked 
out.  If  the  position  of  the  court  is  not  to  be  shifted  it  is  a  good  plan 
to  sink  small  angle  plates  to  mark  these  four  corners  so  that  when  a 
hard  storm  washes  away  the  lines,  they  will  not  have  to  be  laid  out 
all  over  again. 

The  inner  side-lines  should  be  put  in  next,  each  parallel  with  the 
outer  lines,  and  4  V.  feet  inside,  measuring  them  at  the  base-lines  and 
at  the  net  to  prove  them  parallel.  On  each  of  these  pegs  should  be 
driven  down  just  18  feet  from  either  end,  and  then  they  should  be 
measured  the  "other  way  to  prove  that  each  is  21  feet  from  the  net  and 
42  feet  from  that  at  the  opposite  end.  Across  from  each  of  these  to 
that  on  the  opposite  side,  should  be  marked  the  service-lines,  and  then 
dividing  these  service-lines  in  half,  the  half-court  line  should  be  marked, 
its  distance  being  13 V2  fpet  fi'<>m  each  inner  side-line.  The  court  will 
then  be  completed  and  ready  for  use. 


194  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
in  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  ;  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  oe  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  .joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  .lute  bagging  or  coarse  cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it  ;  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  but 
if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
it  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  balls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  Tlie  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines. 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  it 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often.  It  should  be 
watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in.  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  he  done  in  the  fall. 

■N^'orm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Tarticularly  in 
fertile  ground  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
sod,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  is  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  "be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

Wlien  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse's 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  is 
soft,  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  i-ubber- 
soled  shoes  without  heels.

WHAT  TO   USE 
FOR  LAWN  TENNIS 


To  the  majority  of  those  who  play  lawn  tennis,  the  racket  is  prac- 
tically the  only  implement  of  play  which  has  to  be  selected  by  them 
personally.  This,  then,  is  the  article  in  which  the  greater  number  are 
interested  and  it  shall  therefore  be  considered  first.  Naturally  the 
list  of  styles  and  qualities  on  the  market  is  a  long  one,  but  the  line 
which  is  recognized  as  standard,  and  in  which  will  be  found  the 
greater  number  of  approved  models,  is  that  made  up  by  A.  G.  Spalding 
&  Bros.  ^ 

In  tennis  the  social  status  of  the  players  is  more  nearly  equal  than 
in  such  games  as  base  ball,  foot  ball,  etc.,  and  the  difference  in  prices 


between  rackets  which  appear  to  the  unpracticed  eye  as  very  much 
alike  cannot  be  accounted  for  by  a  desire  of  the  manufacturers  to 
make  up  goods  to  suit  pocketbooks  of  various  sizes.  The  gradations 
of  price  in  these  goods  occur  more  particularly  on  account  of  some 
detail  of  manufacture  which  makes  the  more  costly,  at  the  same  time 
the  more  suited,  to  the  expert  player  than  the  cheaper  grades  on  which 
the  same  amount  of  labor  cannot  be  expended,  and  consequently  these

lattei-   do    not    possess    the    same    nicety    of   balance    and   perfection    of 
finish  which  is  found  in  the  better  grades. 

The  selection  of  a  racket  is  something  that  the  player  should  attend 
to  personally.  Balance  and  weight  must  be  considered  well  before 
making  a  purchase,  and  much  care  should  be  exercised  in  picking  out 
a  racket  which  feels  good  to  handle,  not  heavy  enough  to  appear 
clumsy,  nor  light  enough  to  make  a  fast  service  an  impossibility.  For 
a  man  of  ordinary  strength  14  or  I4I/2  ounces  will  generally'  suit — 
seldom  heavier  than  this  and  very  rarely  below.  The  wrist  is  the 
determining  fnctov.  Thp  handle  generally  i)ipferrpd  is  the  combed 
cedar  or  maliou.iin-.   wliich  is  just  rough  enonuli  to  nivp  a  yood  grip.

A  player  looking  for  the  nearest  approach  to  perfection  in  a  tennis 
racket  will  certainly  enthuse  over  the  Spalding  "Gold  Medal."  The 
shape  of  this  racket  was  decided  upon  only  after  consultation  with 
the  leading  tennis  players,  and  in  the  thought  that  the  best  features 
have  been  taken  from  the  opinion  of  each,  always  bearing  in  mind  the 
necessity  of  producing  a  racket  possessing  both  firmness  and  resiliency. 
The  frames  are  made  of  selected  white  ash,  highly  polished,  with 
dogwood  insertion  at  the  shoulders,  the  heretofore  weakly  constructed 
point  of  a  racket  eliminated  in  this  in.stance  by  the  providing  of  dif- 
ferent grains  which  afford  the  strength  characteristic  of  the  process 
of  veneering.     TTie  throat-piece  is  of  polished  black   walnut;   the   ban-

die,  the  best  grade  of  cedar,  made  in  two  different  sizes:  5,  and  5l^ 
inches  ;  the  stringing  is  of  the  finest  lamb's  gut.  Two  different  styles 
stringing  are  employed,  one  style.  A.  being  the  ordinary  style  with  near- 
ly equal  spaces  between  each  string  ;  the  other  style,  B,  having  addi- 
tional strings  reinforcing  the  central  portion  of  the  racket,  and  this  is 
the  style  used  by  many  of  the  most  prominent  players.  Each  racket  is 
enclosed  in  a  mackintosh  cover,  and  has  a  tag  attached  to  it  giving 
particulars  of  inspection.  The  price  of  the  Spalding  Gold  Medal 
racket  is  .$8.00. 

The  Spalding  Model  Rackets  are  modeled  after  those  used  by  the 
best  players  of  recent  years.  With  beveled  frame,  mahogany  handle 
and   polished   throat-piece.    Models   D  H    and   G  X   cost   $5.00.      These

rackets  are  taped  at  the  shoulders  and  are  superior  to  those  of  other 
makes  usually  sold  at  $6.00. 

The  Spalding  Tournament  is  sterling  value  at  $4.00  and  will  give 
excellent  satisfaction.  The  next  rackets  mentioned  in  the  order  of 
price  are  the  Vantage  and  Slocum,  the  Vantage  having  an  oblong  head, 
while  the  Slocum  is  the  original  Slocum  model  that  has  so  long  been 
found  in  the  Spalding  catalogue  and  which  enjoys  a  high  reputation 
among  tennis  players,  for  many  years  being  considered  the  most  de- 
sirable model  ever  made.     These  rackets  both  sell  at  $3.50. 

Beginners  may  want  rackets  cheaper  in  price  than  those  mentioned 
above,  but  no  matter  what  price  is  paid  for  it,  value  commensurate 
with  price  is  found  in  all  which  bear  the  Spalding  trade  mark.     The

Lakeside  costs  $3.00,  and  is  well  worth  the  price.  After  this  comes 
the  Greenwood  at  $2.00,  the  Geneva  at  $1.50,  and  the  Favorite  at 
$1.00. 

Take  good  care  of  your  racket  if  you  want  it  to  give  satisfaction. 
Remember,  it  is  strung  with  material  that  is  very  susceptible  to  damp- 
ness, and  when  it  breaks  do  not  always  blame  the  manufacturer.  Dry 
heat  will  warp  the  frame,  too,  so  that  extremes  are  to  be  avoided  in 
the  atmosphere  of  the  room  or  closet  where  it  is  kept,  and  if  play  is 
continued  in  the  evening  until  the  dew  is  on  the  ground,  or  if  the 
court  is  near  the  sea,  it  is  well  to  rub  any  moisture  off  the  stringing 
with  a  cloth  before  putting  the  racket  away  in  the  case.     A  good  way

in  which  to  preserve  the  gut  is  to  apply  ordinary  shellac  weekly  ;  by 
doing  this  the  possibility  of  dampness  and  dust  affecting  the  gut  is 
lessened.  If  no  case  is  in  your  possession,  a  press  should  be  used  to 
keep  the  frame  in  shape,  this  especially  so  at  the  seashore. 

Tihe  best  racket  case  is  the  Spalding  No.  5  ;  it  is  made  of  stiff 
leather,  holds  one  racket  and  costs  $5.00.  The  same,  but  made  for 
two  rackets,  is  the  Spalding  No.  7,  which  costs  $7.00.  A  well-made 
cover,  positively  rainproof,  costs  $1.50.  An  excellent  cover  is  the 
No.  2.  the  material  being  moleskin  of  the  heaviest  weight  and  prac- 
tically waterproof,  and  costs  $1.00.  For  those  wishing  a  cheap  cover 
the  No.  1  is  recommended,  which  is  made  of  soft  felt,  and  costs  50 
cents,  while  a  still  cheaper  style.  No.  0,  costs  only  35  cents. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL,

By  far  the  most  practical  form  of  press  and  one  which  will  effect- 
ually prevent  the  frame  warping  is  the  shape  made  by  Spalding  and 
listed  as  No.  1  R.  .^t  costs  $1.00  each,  and  the  same  style,  No.  3  R, 
made  to  hold  one  or  two  rackets,  and  slightly  better  finish,  costs  $2.00. 

Some  players  like  a  rubber  covering  for  the  racket  handle  to  secure 
a  better  grip.     The  Spalding  No.  o.  with  corrugated  surface,  costs  50 


cents.  Other  players  like  some  kind  of  a  tape  wound  around  the  han- 
dle to  secure  a  firm  grip,  for  these  Spalding  is  putting  out  a  rubber 
adhesive  tape  in  rolls  %  inch  wide  containing  3-foot  lengths  and 
packed  in  individual  boxes  at  10c.  each. 

After  the  racket  has  been  in  use  for  a  season  or  so,  a  necessity  will 
very  likely  exist  for  restringing.  This  should  be  done  in  the  proper 
manner,  and  it  really  pays  in  the  end  to  have  some  reliable  firm  do 
the  work  for  you.  Spalding  uses  three  different  qualities  of  gut  for 
restringing  and  the  prices  are  :  for  best  lambs'  gut,  in  white  only, 
$2.50  ;  lambs'  gut,  white  only,  $1.50,  and  Oriental  gut,  white,  red,  or 
red  and  white,  $1.00.  Remember,  the  frame  of  a  racket  can  be  pulled 
out  of  shape  very  easily  by  an  inexperienced  person  in  stringing,  and 
the  same  rendered  absolutely  valueless  thereby.  Spalding  employs 
experts,  and  if  possible  the  racket  frame  is  improved  in  shape  after 
going  through   their   hands  rather  than  otherwise. 

When  you  purchase  tennis  balls,  you  do  so  perhaps  after  having 
played  with  those  a  friend  purchased.  His  judgment  may  guide  you 
in  selecting  the  brand,  but  at  any  rate  don't  rob  the  game  of  half  its 
good  points  by  purchasing  something  that  looks  like  what  he  used, 
but  the  similarity  of  which  does  not  go  below  the  felt  cover.  The 
best  grade  ball,  and  one  that  is  guaranteed  absolutely  perfection,  is 
the  Spalding  Championship  No.  00,  which  costs  $4.00  per  dozen.  A 
ball  of  uniform  quality,  carefully  constructed  and  warranted  to  give 
satisfaction,  is  the  Spalding  Tournament  No.  0,  which  costs  $3.00  per 
dozen. 

Although  every  one  who  wishes  to  play  the  game  may  not  have  a 
place  to  play,  it  is  generally  possible  to  find  a  plot  of  ground  which 
can  be  arranged  suitably,  and  the  expense  of  improving  same  and 
keeping  it  in  good  order  can  be  borne  by  a  small  circle  among  those 
of  your  friends  who  wish  to  play.  If  this  cannot  be  done,  the  would- 
be  player  can  generally  obtain  admittance  to  some  already  organized 
club,    while    in   some   of   the    larger   cities   grounds   are   let   out   by   the

hour,  so  that  the  problem  of  where  to  play  need  not  bother  the 
aspirant  for  honors  on  the  tennis  court  if  he  makes  an  effort  at  all 
to  obtain  the  information.  Presuming  that  you  have  found  a  suitable 
plot  of  ground,  have  it  worked  up  to  a  point  where  it  can  be  used  for 
a  tennis  court.  The  next  matter  to  consider  will  be  the  equipment 
that  will  be  necessary  to  fit  it  up  for  playing.

The  poles  must  be  purchased  first.  They  are  made  in  a  number  of 
styles,  and  the  prices  range  from  one  to  twenty  dollars  per  pair.  If 
you  want  the  best,  most  decidedly  get  the  Spalding  Championship 
No.  A,  which  cost  $20.00  and  are  worth  every  penny  of  the  price. 
The  uprights  are  made  of  heavy  2-inch  japanned  iron  piping,  pointed 
at  lower  end  so  as  to  go  24  inches  into  the  ground,  and  equipped  with 
wheel  at  the  top.  A  strong  ratchet  of  an  improved  style  and  neat  in 
appearance  for  tightening  the  net  is  attached  to  one  of  "the  posts.  One 
of  the  features  of  these  posts  is  the  method  of  insuring  absolute 
rigidity  when  the  net  is  in  position.  This  is  done  by  means  of  triple 
claw  clutches  made  of  heavy  wrought  iron,  which  insure  against  the 
possibility  of  any  shifting  or  shaking  after  same  have  been  placed  in 
position.  These  posts  are  in  use  at  the  Newport  Casino  and  leading 
tennis  clubs  of  the  country. 

The  Spalding  Club  posts  No.  B  are  made  of  best  quality  2%  inch 
square  ash,  nicely  polished  and  varnished,  equipped  with  japanned 
braces  so  as  to  make  the  posts  absolutely  rigid,  and  when  set  in  posi- 
tion they  extend  24  inches  into  the  ground,  which  with  the  braces 
ensures  rigidity.  The  ratchet  on  these  posts  is  made  of  heavy  brass, 
and  in  addition  to  its  presenting  a  handsome  appearance,  is  of  great 
strength  and  durability.  The  Spalding  Club  posts  No.  B  cost  $10.00 
per  pair.

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

A  style  that  is  absolutely  first  class  and  one  which  is  steadily  in- 
creasing in  popularity  is  the  one  that  Spalding  lists  as  the  Casino 
No.  C,  and  which  costs  $6.00  per  pair.  They  are  square  poles,  have 
heavy  japanned  iron  braces,  together  with  ratchet  crank  for  tighten- 
ing net  to  keep  them  rigid  when  set  up.  These  poles  can  be  left  up  per- 
manently ;  they  are  inserted  24  inches  into  the  ground  and  they  need  no 
guy  ropes  or  pegs. 

No.  D  posts  are  made  similar  in  style  to  No.  C  except  that  they 
have  no  reel,  and  are  not  as  well  finished,  lessening  their  cost  to  $4.00. 
The  No.  E  poles  cost  $2.00  per  pair.  They  are  finely  polished,  solid 
and  spiked,  and  are  packed  complete  with  guy  ropes  and  pegs.  For 
$1.00  per  pair  you  can  obtain  a  fair  quality  pole — the  Spalding  No.  F — 
also  complete  with  guy   ropes  and  pegs. 

Now  as  to  the  net.  This  will  have  to  be  selected  according  to 
whether  you  have  a  double  or  single  court  to  fit  out.  Although  the 
Spalding  No.  1  measures  27  feet  and  costs  75  cents,  still,  even  for  a 
single  court,  it  will  be  well  to  pick  out  a  net  measuring  36  feet.  The 
cheaper  grades  are  machine  made  and  the  No.  2.  measuring  full  36 
feet,  costs  $1.00.  A  double  court  net,  42  feet  long,  of  same  grade  as 
these  other  two,  costs  $1.50.  It  is  a  question  whether  in  the  long 
run  it  is  not  better  to  get  a  good  quality  hand  made  net.  It  is  also 
important  to  have  it  bound  with  a  wide  strip  of  white  canvas  at  the 
top.  This  will  help  the  players  by  enabling  them  to  see  the  top  of  the 
net  at  a  glance.  Spalding's  No.  2B.  which  measures  36  feet  and  is 
made  of  21  thread  white  twine  and  canvas  bound,  hand-made  through- 
out, costs  $3.50.  The  same  grade,  but  42  feet  long — No.  3B — costs 
$4.00.  Corresponding  to  these  in  machine  made  nets  of  15  thread 
twine,  the  36-foot  style,  No.  2A,  costs  $2.00,  and  the  42  foot,  No.  3A, 
$2.25.  The  Spalding  Intercollegiate  nets  have  given  excellent  satis- 
faction and  are  very  popular.  They  are  hand  knit  of  21  thread  twine, 
and  have  extra  wide  white  canvas  strip  at  top.  This  style  and  qual- 
ity is  used  at  Newport  and  all  championship  events.  No.  2E,  Inter- 
collegiate, 36  feet.  21  thread,  costs  $4.00,  and  the  same,  but  measur- 
ing 42  feet.  No.  3E,  costs  $4.50.  A  net  with  double  centre  should  be 
used  on  a  court  where  there  are  men  who  hit  the  ball  hard  and  fast. 
This  is  a  patented  feature  of  the  Spalding  nets.  The  No.  2C  is  36 
feet  long,  with  11  feet  of  15  thread  twine  double  knitted  in  the  centre, 
and  costs  $4.50  each.  No.  2D  is  the  same,  but  of  21  thread  twine, 
and  costs  $5.00  each.  No.  3C  costs  $5.00.  is  42  feet  long  and  has  13 
feet  of  15  thread  twine  double  knitted  in  the  centre.  Tlie  same,  but  of 
21  thread  twane,  is  listed  as  Spalding's  No.  3D  and  costs  $5.50. 

During  the  past  two  years  nets  made  of  black  twine  have  been  sub- 
stituted for  tarred  nets  as  previously  made,  the  advantage  being  that 
it  is  impossible  with  these  nets  to  soil  one's  clothes  :  no  disagreeable 
feature  presents  itself  in  the  handling  of  same,  and  the  player  is  able 
to  see  the  ball  through  the  mesh  of  the  net  with  the  same  facility  as 
offered  by  the  tarred  nets.  These  black  nets  will  last  practically  as 
long  as  the  tarred  and  present  a  much  more  sightly  appearance  on 
the  lawn.  Thev  are  furnished  in  double  centre.  21  thread— one  at  36 
feet  selling  at  "$6.00.  and  the  other  at  42  feet  at  $6.50,  and  in  30 
thread  single  centre  36  feet  at  $6.50.  and  42  feet  at  $7.00. 

To  keep  the  centre  of  the  net  at  a  required  height  a  strap  or  fork 
should  be  used,  preferablv  thp  former,  as  there  is  then  no  danger  of 
the  ball  glancing  off  and"  striking  out  of  court,  as  is  occasionally  the 
case  witlf  an  iron  centre  fork.  No.  3-0  Centre  Strap  costs  $1.25  each, 
is  Tournament  Pattern  and  has  a  turnbuckle  with  which  height  of  net 
can  be  adjusted  to  a  hair.  No.  2-0  is  a  similar  style  and  costs  $1.00 
each,  but  has  not  the  turnbuckle  attachment. 

Iron  centre  forks  are  made  in  two  styles:  No.  I,  regulation,  patent 
stirrups,  costs  $1.00,  and  No.  2,  an  ordinary  iron  fork,  costs  60  cents.

Canvas  Centre  Strap. 

It  is  well  to  have  a  set  of  marking  plates  for  permanently  marking 
the  angles  of  court.  They  are  sunk  to  the  level  of  the  court  and  must 
not  under  any  circumstances  protrude  above.  Spalding  makes  two 
styles  :  No.  1,  with  separate  pins,  costs  .'pl.OO  per  set  :  No.  2,  with 
wedge  pins  attached,  $1.50  per  set.  Marking  tapes  will  be  found  very 
useful  and  particularly  convenient  where  one  has  to  mark  out  the 
court  himself.  Spalding's  No.  3  costs  $3.50  per  set.  and  are  for  single 
court,  and  come  complete  with  100  staples  and  pins.  For  double  court 
two  styles  are  made  :  No.  4  costs  $4.00  per  set.  complete  with  200 
staples  and  14  pins  ;  No.  6  are  also  for  double  court,  but  are  made  of

extra  quality  canvas  and  cost  $6.00  per  set  complete.  In  each  set 
the  tapes  are  cut  in  proper  lengths  for  each  line  of  the  court,  and  the 
staples  and  pins  furnished  are  sufficient  to  secure  it  by  using  them 
at  frequent  intervals. 

Backstop  nets  will  be  required  and  for  them  also  poles  of  suitable 
height.  Spalding's  No.  BS  poles  cost  $1.00  each.  No.  4  net.  measur- 
ing 50  feet  long  by  7  feet  high  and  made  of  9-thread  twine,  costs 
$2.50.  No.  5  net,  50  feet  long  bv  8  feet  high  and  12-thread  twine, 
costs  $3.00.  Both  of  these  are  white.  A  tarred  backstop  net  is  listed 
as  No.  5X  and  costs  $3.50.  It  is  50  feet  long,  8  feet  high  and  made 
of  12-thread  twine. 

For  the  same  reason  that  it  is  advisable  to  move  the  posts  from 
time  to  time  on  a  grass  court  in  order  to  save  the  turf,  it  will  also 
be  necessary  to  have  some  arrangements  for  marking  the  lines  afresh 
as  they  are  rubbed  or  washed  awav.  The  Spalding  drv  marker  No.  3 
costs  $2.00.  and  can  be  used  on  a  dirt  court  with  marble  dust,  slacked 
lime,  etc.  The  No.  2  dry  marker  similar  in  style  but  not  as  well  made 
can  be  bought  for  $1.00.  The  Columbia  tennis  marker  costs  $5.00 
and  is  suitable  particularly  for  marking  grass  courts.     It  has  a  tank

THE  SPALDING  GOLD  MEDAL  RACKET, 
accompanied  by  the  broadest  guarantee  ever 
given  on  an  article  of  this  kind  has  really 
proved  the  greatest  sensation  in  the  tennis  line 
for  many  years.  Our  care  in  designing  the  racket 
at  first,  and  then  in  making  certain  that  every  de- 
tail of  manufacture  was  absolutely  best  quality,  has 
brought  to  us  players  who  were  dissatisfied  with 
rackets  of  unreliable  quality,  and  a  number  of 
championships  have  been  won  by  well  known 
players  using  the  Gold  Medal  Racket.  We  use  a 
dogwood  insertion  in  shoulders  after  proving  to  ^ 
our  satisfaction  by  bitter  experience  that  it  is  far  ^ 
superior  to  cane  or  other  material  for  the  purpose,       v 


THE  difference  between  styles  A  and  B  is  in 
the  additional  strings  reinforcing  the  central 
portion  of  the  latter.  Handles  5  and  5}{  in. 
in  circumference.  Stringing  of  clearest  and  abso- 
lutely best  quality  lambs'  gut.  Each  racket  en- 
closed in  special  qualfty  mackintosh  cover.  Tag 
attached  to  each  racket  giving  particulars  of  special 
inspection.

SPALDING 

CHAMPIONSHIP 

TENNIS  POSTS 

THIS  style  post  is  really  the  most  practi- 
cable ever  made.  Expert  players  who 
have  taken  part  in  national  and  other 
tournaments  will  recognize  in  it  an  old  friend, 
improved  in  some  respects  and  just  as  reliable 
as  ever.  Uprights  are  made  of  heavy  2-inch 
japanned  iron  piping,  pointed  at  lower  end  so 
so  as  to  go  24  inches  into  ground  and  equipped 
with  wheel  at  top.  Ratchet  for  tightening  net 
is  of  an  improved  style,  neat  in  appearance 
but  with  a  particularly  strong  leverage.    Iron 

hooks  and  cleats  for  fastening  ropes. 
One  of  the  special  features  of  this  style  post, 
outside  of  the  rachet,  is  the  method  of  ensur- 
ing absolute  rigidity  when  net  is  in  position. 
By  means  of  triple  claw  clutches  made_  of 
heavy  wrought  iron,  there  can  be  no  shifting 
or  shaking  once  they  are  placed  in  position, 
and  the  tighter  the  net  is  drawn  the  more 
rigid  the  posts  become.

To  insure  absolute  rigidity,  a 
prime  requisite  in  a  tennis 
post,  it  is  really  necessary 
that  some  part  of  the  post  itself 
should  go  into  the  ground.  Our  ex- 
perience has  taught  us  the  futility 
of  endeavoring  to  provide  fasten- 
ings which  do  not  embrace  this 
idea,  and  we  believe  that  the  vast 
majority  of  those  who  have  any- 
thing to  do  with  the  care  of  a  ten- 
nis court  will  agree  with  us  in  this 
statement. 

Our  club  Tennis  Posts  are  made  of 
best  quality  2  3-4  inch  square  ash, 
nicely  polished  and  varnished, 
equipped  with  japanned  braces  so 
as  to  make  posts  absolulely  rigid, 
and  when  set  in  position  the  posts 
extend  24  inches  into  the  ground. 

We  call  particular  attention  to  the 
extra  heavy  brass  ratchet  witli 
which  we  equip  this  style  post.  It 
is  made  after  an  English  design 
and  is  the  same  as  supplied  by  our 
London  House  to  some  of  the  best 
clubs  in  great  Brittain.

TETHER   TENNIS   GAME 


'T'HIS  game  was  originally  intro- 
■■■    duced  for  the  purpose  of  prac- 
ticing   various    strokes    at    Lawn 
Tennis.     It  has  now  developed  into 
a  game  having  special  merits  of  its 
own.     The   implements   consist  of 
an  upright  pole  standing  9  or  10 
feet  out  of  the  ground,  having  a 
line  marked  round  the  pole  6  feet 
from    the   ground.      Attached   to 
the  top  of  the  pole  is  a  piece  of 
cord,  at  the  end  of  which  is  fas- 
tened a  Lawn  Tennis  ball.    A  line 
is  drawn  on  the  ground  3  feet  from 
the  pole  on  opposite   sides  of  it. 
The  players  stand  outside  this  line, 
using  an  ordinary    Lawn   Tennis 
racket.    The  game  is  to  wind  the 
cord,  with  the  ball  attached,  round 
the  pole  and  above  the  line.    The 
game  is  usually  started  by  tossing 
for  service.  The  winner  then  ta 
the  ball  in  his  hand  and  with  the 
racket  drives  it  round  the  pole;  the 
opponent  stops 
the  progress  of 
the  ball  and  en- 
deavors to  drive 
it    back    again 
and  round   the 
pole  in  the  op- 
p  o  s  i  t  e    direc- 
tion. The  player

LOCHERS 

Lockers  That,  Last* 

■yV/'OODEN  lockers  are  objectionable 
because  they  attract  vermin,  re- 
tain odors  and  can  be  easily  broken  into, 
and  are  dangerous  on  account  of  fire. 
Lockers  made  from  wire  mesh  or  ex- 
panded metal  afford  little  security,,  as 
they  can  be  easily  entered  with  wire 
cutters.  Clothes  placed  in  them  become 
covered  with  dust ;  and  the  lockers 
themselves  present  a  poor  appearance, 
resembling  animal  cages.

Durand -Steel 
Lockers 

are  made  of 
high-grade  steel 
plates,  and  are 
finished  with 
gloss-black  fur- 
nace baked  (400°)  Japan,  comparable  to  that 
used  on  hospital  ware,  which  will  never  flake 
off  nor  require  refinishing,  as  do  paints  and  • 
enamels. 

Durand-St,eel  Lockers 

are  usually  built  with  doors  perforated  full 
length  in  panel  design,  with  sides  and  backs 
solid.  This  prevents  clothes  in  one  locker  from 
coming  in  contact  with  wet  garments  in  adjoin- 
ing lockers,  whi^e  plenty  of  ventilation  is  secured 
by  having  the  door  perforated  its  entire  length, 
but  if  the  purchaser  prefers  we  perforce fc  the 
backs  also.

NO.  232— HOW  TO  RUN  THE  BASES,  f 
The  importance  of  base  running  as  a  I 
scientific  feature  of  the  national  game  is 
becoming  more  and  more  recognized  each 
year.  Besides  being  spectacular,  feats  of 
base  stealing  nearly  always  figure  in  the 
winning  of  a  game.  Many  a  close  contest 
is  decided  on  the  winning  of  that  little 
strip  of  90  feet  which  lies  between 
cushions.  When  hits  are  few  and  the 
enemy's  pitchers  steady,  it  becomes  in- 
cumbent on  the  opposing  team  to  get 
around  the  bases  in  some  manner.  Ef- 
fective stealing  not  only  Increases  the  ef- 
fectiveness of  the  team  by  advancing  its 
runners  without  wasting  hits,  but  it 
serves  to  materially  disconcert  the 
enemy  and  frequently  has  caused  an 
entire  opposing  club  to  temporarily  lose 
its  poise  and  throw  away  the  game. 
This  book  gives  clear  and  concise  direc- 
tions for  excelling  as  a  base  runner; 
tells  when  to  run  and  when  not  to  do 
so;  how  and  when  to  slide;  team  work 
on  the  bases;  in  fact,  every  point  of  the 
game  is  thoroughly  explained.  Illus- 
trated with  pictures  of  leading  players. 
Price  10  cents.
