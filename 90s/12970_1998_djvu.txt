CHAPTER 1 


PURPOSE OF THE ASRC 


INTRODUCTION 


The Australian Standard Research Classification (ASRC) is the collective 
name for a set of three related classifications developed for use in the 
measurement and analysis of research and experimental development 
(R&D) undertaken in Australia, both in the public and private sectors. It 
allows the comparison of R&D data between sectors of the Australian 
economy (e.g. general government, private non-profit organisations, 
business enterprises and educational institutions). One of the component 
classifications, Research Fields, Courses and Disciplines, is designed to 
also allow data collected on higher education courses, units of study and 
teaching activity to be categorised. 


Use of these classifications ensures that R&D statistics and statistics 
collected from higher education institutions are useful to governments, 
educational institutions, international organisations, scientific, professional 
or business organisations, business enterprises, community groups and 
private individuals. 


To support international comparisons, it is important for the 
classifications to relate to those used in other countries, particularly those 
whose stage of social and economic development is similar to that of 
Australia. Therefore, the definition, scope and classification of R&D 
activities contained in this publication largely follow the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Proposed Standard 
Practice for Surveys of Research and Experimental Development, 

“Frascati Manual”, Fifth Revision 1993. 


The classifications contained in the ASRC are used for the compilation of 
R&D statistics and, commencing in 2000, will be used for classifying 
other selected statistics collected from higher education institutions. 
Details about these statistics are released in the following: 


Research and Experimental Development, Business Enterprises, Australian 
Bureau of Statistics (8104.0); 


Research and Experimental Development, General Government and 
Private Non-Profit Organisations, Australian Bureau of Statistics 
(8109.0); 


Research and Experimental Development, Higher Education 
Organisations, Australian Bureau of Statistics (8111.0); 


Research and Experimental Development, All Sector Summary, Australian 
Bureau of Statistics (8112.0); and 


publications of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and 
Youth Affairs.

PURPOSE OF THE ASRC The development of the classifications in this publication has been 

continued undertaken by the ABS in co-operation with major research organisations 
and users of research information. This consultative process has sought 
to ensure that the ASRC is widely accepted and used within Australia as 
an Australian Standard, not only in the compilation of R&D statistics but 
also in the study of Australian research generally. 


CLASSIFICATIONS INCLUDED There are three classifications in the ASRC: 


IN THE PUBLICATION 
Type of Activity; 


Research Fields, Courses and Disciplines ; and 
Socio-economic Objective. 


These are used in official statistics to analyse the nature of R&D 
undertaken in Australia. The classifications are used in conjunction with 
industrial and institutional sector classifications to produce a set of 
official statistics which support a variety of user interests. In addition, the 
Research Fields, Courses and Disciplines classification will be used by the 
Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to 
classify data collected from higher education institutions. 


Type of Activity Classification This classification allows R&D activity to be categorised according to the 
(TOA) type of research effort, namely, pure basic research, strategic basic 
research, applied research and experimental development. 


Definitions and guidelines for classifying R&D by TOA are covered in 
Chapter 2. 


Research Fields, Courses This classification allows both R&D activity and other activity within the 
and Disciplines Classification higher education sector to be categorised. It allows R&D activity to be 
(RFCD) categorised according to the field of research undertaken. In this respect, 
it is the nature of the R&D which is being examined. In addition, the 
classification is to be used within the higher education sector to classify 
courses, units of study and teaching activity to field. 


The categories in the classification include recognised academic 
disciplines and related major sub-fields taught at universities or tertiary 
institutions, major fields of research investigated by national research 
institutions and organisations, and emerging areas of study. 


Explanatory notes, definitions and guidelines for classifying data and the 
full classification are covered in Chapter 3. 


2 ABS e AUSTRALIAN STANDARD RESEARCH CLASSIFICATION * 1297.0 ° 1998 


Socio-economic Objective 
Classification (SEO) 


ADVANTAGES OF THE ASRC 


This classification allows R&D to be categorised according to the 
purpose of the R&D as perceived by the data provider (researcher). It 
consists of discrete economic, social, technological or scientific domains 
for identifying the principal purpose of the R&D. The attributes applied 
to the design of the SEO Classification comprise a combination of 
processes, products, health, education and other social and 
environmental aspects of particular interest. 


Explanatory notes, definitions and guidelines for classifying R&D by 
socio-economic objective and the full classification are covered in 
Chapter 4. 


The ASRC provides a three way matrix of classification. Each R&D activity 
can be classified by Type of Activity, Research Fields, Courses and 
Disciplines and Socio-economic Objective. 


The ASRC provides a considerable degree of flexibility in meeting the 
needs of a wide variety of users. The hierarchical structure of both the 
RFCD and SEO Classifications enables them to be applied to particular 
purposes at various levels. 


If the requirement is for general policy purposes, then a variety of 
approaches is available. For example, by using data compiled according 
to both the RFCD and SEO Classifications, it is possible to identify how 
much R&D expenditure in any particular field of research has been 
devoted to a particular socio-economic objective. The ASRC helps classify 
multi-disciplinary work, where several disparate areas of the RFCD are 
usually brought together to address one area, or closely related areas of 
the SEO. 


The complexity of issues addressed by R&D is such that questions of 
public policy often arise in a manner which cannot be readily seen in 
advance. The detail available in both the RFCD and SEO Classifications 
would be sufficient to facilitate the provision of statistics which can be 
used in a variety of contexts. For example, areas of key technological 
significance could generally be assessed using an aggregate of appropriate 
RFCD disciplines or subjects. It is possible, therefore, that the use of the 
ASRC for ABS R&D surveys may obviate or minimise the need for 
separate one-off R&D surveys aimed at narrow areas. 


A particular strength of the ASRC is that it preserves comparability with 
much of the previous data in the ABS R&D series, while possessing a 
framework which enables comparisons with other classifications used 
nationally and internationally. 


In the case of the SEO Classification, there is a strong alignment between 
the SEO and the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial 
Classification (ANZSIC). This is most applicable within the manufacturing 
subdivision of the SEO. It is possible to correlate trends in industry with 
levels of R&D directed towards particular industries, by using both SEO 
and ANZSIC data. 


ABS ¢ AUSTRALIAN STANDARD RESEARCH CLASSIFICATION ¢ 1297.0 e 1998 3 


DEFINITION OF R&D R&D is defined according to the OECD standard as comprising creative 
work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of 
knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the 
use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. 


An R&D activity is characterised by originality. It has investigation as a 
primary objective, the outcome of which is new knowledge, with or 
without a specific practical application, or new or improved materials, 
products, devices, processes or services. R&D ends when work is no 
longer primarily investigative. 


SCOPE OF R&D As indicated in the Frascati Manual and as experience has shown, there 
are difficulties in delineating the point which clearly separates the 
culmination of R&D investigative work and the beginning of the 
implementation phase of the innovations or recommendations resulting 
from R&D. Errors at this point are particularly significant because, 
although R&D programmes require large outlays of resources, the costs 
of implementing innovations or recommendations resulting from R&D 
may also be as high or higher in many instances. 


There are also a wide range of scientific and related activities which are 
not R&D, but which are closely linked with R&D in terms of 
organisation, resource allocation, institutional affiliation and the use or 
flow of information. However, activities conducted solely or primarily for 
the purposes of R&D support are included in R&D. 


The activities which do not have clear boundaries with R&D are listed 
below. 


(a) Education and training of personnel and students 


Postgraduate research, including supervision of the research, is 
considered to be R&D. The development of new teaching methods is 
also regarded as R&D. However, teaching and training students, using 
established methods and subject knowledge, is excluded. 


(b) Specialised scientific and technical information services 


Specialised scientific and technical information services which are 
undertaken solely in support of R&D are regarded as R&D. Examples of 
these are scientific data collection, coding, recording, classification, 
dissemination, translation, analysis and bibliographic services. 


These specialised services are excluded if they are undertaken 
independently and not solely in support of R&D. 


(CQ) General purpose or routine data collection 


Collecting data in support of R&D work is included in R&D. 


4 ABS e AUSTRALIAN STANDARD RESEARCH CLASSIFICATION * 1297.0 ° 1998 


SCOPE OF R&D continued However, data collection of a general nature is excluded. This is normally 
carried out by government agencies to record natural, biological, 
economic or social phenomena of general public or government interest. 
Examples are national population censuses, surveys of unemployment, 
topographical mapping and routine geographical or environmental 
surveys. 


(d) Maintenance of national standards 


Routine testing and analysis of materials, components, products, 
processes, soils, atmospheres, etc. for standard compliance is excluded 
from R&D. 


(e) Feasibility studies 
Feasibility studies undertaken in support of R&D are included. 


However, a feasibility study which involves gathering information about 
existing conditions, for use in deciding whether or not to implement a 
project, is excluded, e.g. a study to determine the viability of a 
petrochemical complex in a particular location. 


() Specialised medical care 


R&D includes the development of new treatments and procedures, 
including such developments in conjunction with advanced medical care 
and examinations usually carried out by university hospitals. 


However, routine investigations or normal application of specialised 
medical knowledge, techniques or equipment are excluded from R&D. 
Examples of these are pathology, forensic and post mortem procedures. 


(g) Patent and licence work 


Patent work connected directly with R&D projects is included in R&D. 
However, commercial, administrative and legal work associated with 
patenting, copywriting and licensing, is excluded. 


(b) Policy related studies 


The boundary between certain policy related studies as described in the 
Frascati Manual and R&D is complex. In the Frascati Manual, policy 
related studies cover activities such as the ‘analysis and assessment of 
existing programmes, continued analysis and monitoring of external 
phenomena (e.g. defence and security analysis), legislative inquiry 
concerned with general government departmental policy or operations’. 
Rigour is required to separate policy related studies which are not R&D 
from true R&D policy work. 


Studies to determine the effects of a specific national policy to a 
particular economic or social condition or social group may have 
elements of R&D. Routine management studies or efficiency studies are 
excluded. 


ABS e AUSTRALIAN STANDARD RESEARCH CLASSIFICATION e 1297.0 e 1998 5 


SCOPE OF R&D continued @ Marketing and market studies 


Market research and opinion polls are excluded from R&D. 
@ Mineral exploration 


The development of new or vastly improved methods of data acquisition, 
processing and interpretation of data is included as R&D. Surveying 
undertaken as an integral part of an R&D project to observe geological 
phenomena is also regarded as R&D. However, the search for minerals 
using existing methods is excluded from R&D. 


(k) Prototypes and pilot plants 


The design, construction and testing of prototypes generally falls within 
the scope of R&D. However, trial production and copying of prototypes 
are excluded from R&D. 


The construction and operation of pilot plants is part of R&D provided 
that these are used to obtain experience or new data for evaluating 
hypotheses. 


Pilot plants are excluded from R&D as soon as the experimental phase is 
over or as soon as they are used as normal commercial production units, 
even if they continue to be described as ‘pilot plants’. 


If a pilot plant is used for combined operations, the component used for 
R&D is to be estimated. 


(LD Other activities 


All other activities which are ancillary or consequential to R&D are 
excluded. Examples of these are interpretative commentary using existing 
data, forecasting, operations research as a contribution to decision 
making and the use of standard techniques in applied psychology to 
classify or diagnose human characteristics. 


R&D UNIT TO BE There are some inherent difficulties in formulating a definition of what 

CLASSIFIED constitutes a unit of R&D. Because there is a lack of uniformity in 
organisational structures and considerable variation in the way 
organisations allocate resources to R&D activities, any standard definition 
of a unit of R&D seems certain to be somewhat theoretic. From a 
statistical viewpoint it is desirable that R&D expenditure be reported in 
the smallest cluster which can be classified to a single field of research 
and a single socio-economic objective. The extent to which it is not 
practicable to provide this detail will reduce the validity and usefulness 
of the classification, and the resulting R&D statistics. 


6 ABS e AUSTRALIAN STANDARD RESEARCH CLASSIFICATION e 1297.0 e 1998 


R&D UNIT TO BE 
CLASSIFIED continued 


The most common real world references to an R&D unit whose activities 
are to be classified are Research Program and Research Project. 
However, these focal units would seldom approximate the idealised unit 
of R&D as outlined above. They may or may not correspond to actual 
organisational structures. In its most simple form, a Research Project may 
consist of a part of the time and energy of an own account single entity 
(such as a PhD student). 


There are Research Projects, especially in the social sciences, which 
require a multi-disciplinary approach in order to achieve a purpose. 
There are also Research Projects which consist of sub-projects. For 
example, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organisation (CSIRO) has cited a Research Project as often consisting of a 
set of sub-projects (staff) with a common purpose and one person 
designated as the project leader.

CHAPTER 2 


TYPE OF ACTIVITY (TOA) 


GUIDELINES FOR 
CLASSIFYING R&D BY TOA 


TYPE OF ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATION 


Four types of activity applicable to R&D are recognised in this 
classification: 


Pure basic research 
Strategic basic research 
Applied research 
Experimental development 


Pure basic research is experimental and theoretical work undertaken to 
acquire new knowledge without looking for long term benefits other 
than the advancement of knowledge. 


Strategic basic research is experimental and theoretical work undertaken 
to acquire new knowledge directed into specified broad areas in the 
expectation of useful discoveries. It provides the broad base of 
knowledge necessary for the solution of recognised practical problems. 


Applied research is original work undertaken primarily to acquire new 
knowledge with a specific application in view. It is undertaken either to 
determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to 
determine new ways of achieving some specific and predetermined 
objectives. 


Experimental development is systematic work, using existing knowledge 
gained from research or practical experience, that is directed to 
producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new 
processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those 
already produced or installed. 


A Research Project is normally to be classified under only one type of 
activity. However, there are instances where a research project is large 
and could potentially be classifiable to more than one type, i.e. a project 
could have sub-projects with elements of both applied and experimental 
research. In this case, the proportion of resources attributable to each 
should be allocated to each type.

NATURE AND PURPOSE OF 
THE RFCD CLASSIFICATION 


STRUCTURE OF THE RFCD 
CLASSIFICATION 


RESEARCH FIELDS, COURSES AND DISCIPLINES 
CLASSIFICATION (RFCD) 


This classification allows both R&D activity and other activity within the 
higher education sector to be categorised. 


The categories in the classification include recognised academic 
disciplines and related major sub-fields taught at universities or tertiary 
institutions, major fields of research investigated by national research 
institutions and organisations, and emerging areas of study. 


While this classification includes individual specialised fields of national 
interest, it generally reflects the overall structure of disciplinary fields. 


R&D activity is classified according to the field of research undertaken. In 
this respect, it is the nature of the R&D itself which is being examined, 
rather than the activity of the performing unit or the purpose of the 
R&D. Higher education courses, units of study and teaching activity are 
classified according to field. 


The classification is arranged in a hierarchical structure. It has 
24 divisions, 139 disciplines and 898 subjects. 


The divisions are: 


210000 Science—General 

220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts—General 

230000 Mathematical Sciences 

240000 Physical Sciences 

250000 Chemical Sciences 

260000 Earth Sciences 

270000 Biological Sciences 

280000 Information, Computing and Communication

GUIDELINES FOR 
CLASSIFYING BY RFCD 


RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER 
CLASSIFICATIONS 


Divisions, disciplines and subjects are each assigned a six-digit code. 
Divisions are uniquely identified by the first two digits and the remainder 
of the code is zero filled. Disciplines are uniquely identified by the first 
four digits and the remainder of the code is zero filled. Each subject has 
an unique six-digit code. 


There are ninety-nine possible categories at the discipline and subject 
levels, to allow for future expansion of the classification. 


The following general procedures are aimed to ensure consistent and 
successful classification. 


A research project or course is to be allocated to a RFCD subject in a 
hierarchical manner. This is achieved by first determining the division in 
which the research is being performed, then the most relevant discipline 
within that division and then the most relevant subject within that 
discipline. 


It is vital to firstly identify the higher level classifications as some 
subjects, although within different disciplines, have identical titles. 


There are two ‘general’ divisions (210000 Science—General and 220000 
Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts—General) and one ‘general’ 
discipline (320100 Medicine—General) to enable classification of areas of 
study which cannot be allocated to more specific categories. 


The RFCD classification has been designed primarily to meet the needs of 
the ABS and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and 
Youth Affairs for classifying courses and research projects to field of 
study/research and classifying units of study to discipline. It will replace 
the Field of Research (FOR) classification, included in the 1993 edition of 
the ASRC, and the Field of Study Classification of Higher Education 
Courses (FOSCHEC). 


Other classifications which are related to fields of study are: 


s the ABS Classification of Qualifications (ABSCQ) which, although 
primarily designed as a classification of qualifications already obtained, 
may also be used to classify educational courses which lead to these 
qualifications; 


» the Field of Study Classification of Tertiary Education Courses 
(FOSCTEC) which is based on FOSCHEC with some minor variations 
to meet the needs of the vocational education and training sector; and 


= the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) which is 
a classification of educational programmes rather than qualifications. 


The ABS is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the ABSCQ 
with the aim of replacing it with an Australian Standard Classification of 
Education (ASCED). The review is planned to be completed by late 1999. 
At the detailed level, the ASCED Field of Study Classification will be 
consistent with the RFCD with additional categories to cover uniquely 
vocational education and training sector subjects.

CHAPTER 4: SOCIO-ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE CLASSIFICATION (SEO) 


NATURE AND PURPOSE OF 
THE SEO CLASSIFICATION 


STRUCTURE OF THE SEO 
CLASSIFICATION 


The SEO Classification allows R&D data to be classified according to the 
researcher’s perceived purpose. The purpose categories take account of 


processes, products, health, education and other social and 


environmental aspects of particular interest. 


A purpose classification such as the SEO provides a set of categories 


which collectively exhaust all the objectives of research. In this respect, 
the scope of the SEO is more extensive than a classification of economic 


activities such as the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial 


Classification (ANZSIC), because not all R&D has an economic motive or 


context. 


The SEO Classification is arranged in a hierarchical structure. It has 


5 divisions, 18 subdivisions, 107 groups and 594 classes. 


The divisions and subdivisions are: 


Division 1 Defence 
Subdivision 610000 


Defence 


Division 2 Economic Development

STRUCTURE OF THE SEO Subdivisions, groups and classes are all assigned six-digit codes. 

CLASSIFICATION continued Subdivisions are uniquely identified by the first two digits and the 
remainder of the code is zero filled. Groups are uniquely identified by 
the first four digits and the remainder of the code is zero filled. Classes 
have unique six-digit codes. 


There are ninety-nine possible categories at the subdivision, group and 
class levels to allow for future expansion of the classification. The 
divisions are not reflected in the code system at the subdivision or finer 
levels. 


GUIDELINES FOR The following general procedures are aimed to ensure consistent and 
CLASSIFYING R&D BY SEO successful classification of R&D data. 


A Research Project is to be allocated to a class in a hierarchical manner. 
This is achieved by first determining the SEO division in which the 
research is being performed, then the most relevant subdivision within 
that division, then the most relevant group within that subdivision, and 
finally by selecting the relevant class within a chosen group. 


It is vital to firstly identify the higher level classifications for the Research 
Project as some classes, although within different groups, have identical 
class titles. 


In general, a Research Project is to be classified to one class only. There 
are cases however where a large Research Project is directed towards 
more than one socio-economic objective. In such cases, the aim should 
be to allocate R&D resources on a proportional basis. 


Where a defined class cannot be identified within a group for a Research 
Project, the ‘Other’ or ‘n.e.c.’ category at the class level is to be used. 


RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN In studying industry performance, it is possible to compare trends in 
THE SEO CLASSIFICATION industry with the levels of R&D directed towards particular industries. 
AND THE ANZSIC ABS statistics have been compiled according to the Australian and New 


Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC). 


A broad comparison with the ANZSIC categories is shown below.

The ANZSIC is a classification of industries. Business units reporting data 
to a range of ABS censuses and surveys are classified to the ANZSIC on 
the basis of their predominant economic activity (e.g. what they do to 
generate income). Normally income is generated through the sale of 
goods and services produced by the business or bought in from other 
businesses. An industry as represented in ABS statistics is made up of 
businesses which are classified to it in accordance with the ANZSIC. 


When comparing R&D data classified by the SEO with industrial statistics 
based on the ANZSIC, there are some important considerations to be 
noted: 


» Classifying to an SEO category is subjective, i.e. the category is chosen 
by the data provider to indicate the main purpose of R&D. Classifying 
a business to an industry is generally derived objectively through 
information about its main income generating activity. 


=» SEO categories do not always correspond with ANZSIC categories on a 
one to one basis and do not also necessarily correspond with 
identifiable target industries. For example where the environment is 
the main potential beneficiary of the R&D, there is no set of business 
units equivalent and therefore no ANZSIC class is applicable. 


ABS e AUSTRALIAN STANDARD RESEARCH CLASSIFICATION ¢ 1297.0 e 1998 77 





RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
THE SEO CLASSIFICATION 
AND THE ANZSIC continued 


Some SEO categories are too broad and cannot be correlated to 
ANZSIC industries. For example, R&D towards improving road safety 
has potential benefits to a wide range of industries, community 
services and individuals. There would be some effect on businesses 
within the transport industry, but this may be incidental to attempts 
at generally reducing the burden on emergency services, medical 
services, insurance services, disability services, police services, legal 
services, etc. 


The nature of R&D is such that there may be no observable effect on 
ABS industry level statistics, or at least the effect may be difficult to 
assess. The positive effects of R&D may be concealed at the aggregate 
industry level because of variation, for a variety of reasons, in data 
from establishments in the same industry. Additionally, in particular 
instances, R&D may not lead to initiatives which proceed beyond the 
test environment.

DIVISION 5 NON-ORIENTED RESEARCH 
SUBDIVISION 780000 NON-ORIENTED RESEARCH 
GROUP 780100 NON-ORIENTED RESEARCH 


This division covers R&D which contributes to the general advancement of knowledge. This division 
should only be used when no specific purpose under any of the other divisions can be identified. 


This division can only include R&D which is ‘pure basic research’; i.e. R&D efforts which are 
undertaken to acquire new knowledge without any specific application or looking for long term benefits 
other than the advancement of knowledge. 


Group 780100 Non-Oriented Research has nine classes:

CONCORDANCES 


INTRODUCTION 


The following concordances align the classifications contained in the first 
(1993) edition of the ASRC with those contained in this edition. 


The Field of Research (FOR) classification is matched with the Research 
Fields, Courses and Disciplines (RFCD) classification, while the 1993 and 
1998 versions of the Socio-Economic Objective (SEO) classifications are 
matched. 


The Type of Activity (TOA) classification did not change. 
The concordances have been prepared at a broad level. 


They are formatted by placing the structure of the reference classification 
on the left and the categories which align with the reference category on 
the right. 


A ‘p’ after a code indicates that only part of the category matches the 
reference category.
