The MBTA’s core goals (T) 


= To provide reliable service for customers 


= To provide safe modes of transport for our 
communities 


= To operate in a financially sustainable manner

Main messages in this discussion of bus service T) 


Baseline = MBTA-operated bus service plays a critical role in the region, providing 
113M passenger trips annually. The MBTA‘s 2,525 bus personnel work 
hard daily to deliver service to our communities 


= Service performance remains a major issue for the MBTAss riders; roughly 
65% of buses arrive on time, and 30% are crowded at peak times 


= Bus operations and maintenance costs, excluding fuel, have been rising 
at 5% per year’ driven largely by headcount and wage increases 


= Last year’s net subsidy to operate bus service was $224M ($329M less 
$105M in revenue), which is projected to grow to $262M by FY21 


= Certain transit authorities and agencies (e.g., Denver, Orange County, 
Los Angeles, Long-Island, Las Vegas) have used 3" parties to provide 
bus operations and maintenance activities 


= In situations where authorities have contracted substantial amounts of 
their bus service, the contracted portions have been up to 30-40% less 
expensive per hour of service than the internally-provisioned portions

1 MBTA bus on-time performance is defined as “within 3 mins of scheduled departure time” (for core service, and 6 mins for non-core service) 

2 Comparisons to other systems are difficult because systems have different definitions of on-time performance , and do not measure on-time performance 
at the same places 

Note: OCTA contracting on-time performance standard of 85% (departure within 5 minutes of scheduled time), Las Vegas RTC contracting on-time 
performance standard of 95% (departure within 2 minutes of scheduled time), NICE contracting on-time performance standard of 70% (departure within 1

The MBTA bus system is a critical service that is currently facing the 
challenge of aging capital assets, low on-time performance, and a 
growing cost base 


Other authorities’ experience with contracting — and the MBTAs 
experience locally — indicate contracting could be a viable solution 


The MBTA can explore contracting for: 


What innovations and technology could a contractor bring to improve operations 
and customer service? 


To what extent could costs and the required taxpayer subsidy be reduced 
through contracting? 


Could a contractor cost-effectively provide modern facilities to replace the 
MBTA‘s worst-condition ones? 


How much flexibility to expand service would contracting give the MBTA?

Maintenance spend on the Red and Orange lines is driven by the age of the fleets, 
~36 years old. Unit maintenance costs could be reduced by the delivery of new fleets 
(oy CRRC in 2022), and management actions to adjust headcount accordingly 


In FY2016 the MBTA spent approximately $58M in operating costs on rail car 
maintenance, including $19M of heavy maintenance spend in Everett’ 


The Blue line fleet is relatively new with higher spend due to a Reliability Centered 
Maintenance program (RCM) which is expected to reduce heavy 
maintenance/overhaul costs on this fleet in the future 


At current course and speed, rail car maintenance costs on the Red and Orange line 
are expected to grow at ~9% annually (5% excluding added service) and add more 
than $25M to the T’s cost base 


A range of contracting models are used by other transit authorities in order to reduce 
maintenance costs 


Chicago, Atlanta, and Washington D.C. all use flexible contracts for rebuilds (e.g..,
