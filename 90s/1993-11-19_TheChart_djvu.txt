FINANCIAL AID 





Feds select Southern for direct loan 


College one of 105 in nation 


By CHAD HAYWORTH 
EXECUTIVE EDITOR 


tarting in January, 
Missouri Southern will 
become one of only 105 


educational institutions nation- 
wide to offer the Direct Student 
Loan Program 





In Missouri, the Aero 
Mechanics School in Riverside 
and St. Louis Tech in St. Ann 


will join Southern among the 
105 post-secondary schools 
picked by the Education 
Department for the first year of 
tho program

ter set up the student loan 
process,” said Jim Gilbert, direc 
tor of student financial aid at 
Southern, “Right now, there are 

41 guaranteed agencies and sev- 
eral hundred banks who are 
involved in the process.” 

The DSLP will trim the sys- 
tem, Gilbert said, so that there 
will be just one servicer for the 
loan program. Funding will 
come directly from the U.S 
Department of Treasury. In 
addition, the application process 
itself will be streamlined 

“Currently, students who 
apply for loans have to fill out

were given is that it be some

for two years,” said Cami 
Davey, Student Senate presi- 
dent 


“We also wanted someone 
who was involved in campus 
and willing to speak out 

“We wanted someone who was 
willing to stand up and say 
‘This is what the students 
think.” 

Davey said the process to 
chose the now student regent 
began during the spring semes 
ter because it was thought that 
Sencker would graduate in 
May 1993. 

During the summer she 
the names of the three nomina 
tions to the governor's office for 
consideration 

However, the process slowed 
this semester 
when it be 
came known 
Sencker would 
serve until 
after the De 
ember 199 
meeting 

This year, for 
the first time, 
students nomi, Wofford 
nated for the position traveled 
to Jefferson City on Oct. 21 for 


sent 















a personal interview with 
Carnahan. 
*When I ran for it, we only 


had to submit a resume to the 
governor (John Ashcroft),” 
Davey said 

“I see it (the interview) as a 
positive thing 


“It gives more meaning to the 
way, they reward the title of 
dudent regent.” 

Dover thought the personal 





interview with Carnahan was 
positive. 

“It ix a good idea because com- 
munication skills are an impor- 
tant part of the position,” 
said 


she 





Wofford agreed 

*I am impressed that Carn- 
ahan interviews all of the stu- 
dent regent appointments from 
around the state,” he said. 

However, Wofford believed 
Carnahan may have an ulterior 
motive for some of his question- 
ing 

“It scemed like the governor 
was suspicious that the admi 
istration here had been hand- 
picking the nominations,” he 
said. 

“He asked questions like 
‘What do you think of the 
administration?’ rather than 
‘What do you think of Missoun 
Southern?’ 

“Hopefully he doesn’t think 
that now.” 

Dover, a member of the Stu- 
dent Senate for 
two years, is 
also a member 
of the Lion 
Pride March- 
ing Band, the 
flute choir,} 
Omicron Delta 
Kappa, and Phi 












Eta Sigma Schoen 
She said she 
would be “as vocal as possible 


{at Board of Regents meetings] 
in order to address the student 
ce ms” 

Wofford, a member of the 
Math Club, Kappa Mu Epsilon, 
and EDSSA, said he would 
“keep his ears open” to ascer- 
tain student views on the 
issues the regents are dis- 
“I think it will 
bo casi 1 that the Board 
know the students’ views.” 

Schoen, in her second year on 
the Student Senate, is a mem- 
ber of the Southern Concepts 
Ad Club, Alpha Sigma Alpha, 
und Koinonia. 

She said she would point out 
the students’ concerns to the 
Board of Regents. 

“I will have to do a lot of net- 
working and talking with peo- 
ple to see what they are con- 
cerned about,” she said

“We hope to send out in

file on,” he said, “All they will 
have to do is update it and 
bring it in to renew their loan 
application for the next year.” 

After the start of the spring 
semester, applications for new 
loans will be inserted. 

“It is extremely important for 
students to fill out the form as 
correctly as possible,” Gilbert 
said. “This will also help speed 
the process.” 

Although only 105 schools will 
launch the program this year, 
the number will jump next year 
to more than 6,000, Gilbert 
said. By the following year, he 
expects the entire financial aid 
system to be handled through 
the DSLP.

BOARD OF REGENTS 


Concept could save $220,000 annually 


By JOHN HACKER

W outhern Board of Reg 

ents meets today, it will 
consider a proposal to adopt 9 
$17 million ex 
concept for buildings 
Bob Beeler, physical plant 
director, said the concept will 
pay for itself in 11 years by =¥ 
ing Southern ),000 per year 
on the College's $550,000 annual 
utility bill 
“The savings is 
Johnson Control 
for the system],” 











rgy conservation 





n campus 








guaranteed by 
[the cantractor 
Beeler said. “If 








that amount 
trols will write us a 
check (for the difference].” 

The College currently pays 
approximately $450,000 per year 
for electricity and $100,000 for 
natural gas 

The concept has two major com 
Ponents: a lighting retrofit and a 
now digital environmental con: 
trol system. Beeler said the light 
ing retrofit will be the 
Christinas break 

“We are going to work on virtu- 
ally all the fluorescent lamps on 
campus,” he said. “We will install 
@ new energy saving ballast and 
Dew reflectors in each lamp.” 




















The digital environmental con- 
trols for each building may take 
as long as eight months to install. 

“This will give us better control 
of the heating and air condition 
ing in all buildings,” Beeler said. 
“If n room is unoccupied, we can 
turn on or off the heating or air 
conditioning from our central 
control monitors.” 

These monitors, ane in the phys- 









ical plant and one in the mechani- 
cal maintenance office in Spiva 
Library, will allow a person to 
monitor the environment in all 
the buildings at once. The system 
also will include alarms to alert 
the physical plant of any failures 


in the system. 

Beeler said the system is simi- 
lar to one installed in Webster 
Hall when it was completed. This 
system is designed by a different 
company, with the lessons learn- 
ed from that ystem in mind. 

“We do not intend to fall into 
the same traps we had in 
Webster,” he said. 

Beeler said the new system will 
be a vast improvement over the 
current one 

“Our current control system is 
antiquated,” he said. “The new 
system will allow us a comfort 
level we haven't been able to 
match with the old system.”

Survey reveals 


pros and cons 


59% describe 
dinner as ‘poor 


By PAULA SMITH 
CAMPUS EDITOR 


tudents recently had the 
Sec to voice their opin- 

ions about the quality of 
cafeteria cuisine at Missouri 
Southern 

The Student Senate food com- 
mittee, the Residence Hall 
Association, and ServiceMaster 
Food Service at Missouri 
Southern conducted a survey 
Nov. 4, 5, and 8 to learn about 
some of their concerns. 

Doug Carnahan, dean of stu- 
dents, said 126 students were 
surveyed. Results of the survey 
were discussed during a meeting 

















lunch as fair or good. 

“There were no serious con- 
cerns about cleanliness or 
friendliness of the employees,” 
Carnahan said. 

Students asked for more fruit 
and a greater selection of 
desserts for meals. They also 
had some questions involving 
the meal plan. 

“The meal plan is based on a 
missed meal factor,” Carnahan 
said 

If everyone ate three meals a 
day, ServiceMaster would “go 
broke,” he said. 

Carnahan said because there 
are only about 600 students 
with meal tickets, 
ServiceMaster can offer only one 
meal plan. 

“The plan is the most economi- 
cal, and they (ServiceMaster)

Martin Lindstedt to enlist Missouri

no problem with the Libertarian

disturb me is not what Mr. Lindstedt 
appeared to say on the surface, but 
what I fear is at the core of his 
request. I seriously question what 
his motives may be 

‘As you may or may not have

I'm sure anyone who was at Mr. Robert 
Ressler's presentation on serial killers 
that evening will remember him. He 
attempted to create a scene during the 
presentation about FBI involvement at 
Waco, Texas. 

We applauded, literally, the way our 
guest, Mr. Ressler, very effectively 
silenced him. Mr. Lindstedt again 
tried, after the presentation, to create a 
disturbance which eventually led to his 
arrest. He was trying to harass our 
guest on our campus. Is he the type of 
person we want involved in activities 
on our campus? I certainly hope not. 

Mr. Ressler’s presentation was about 
“monsters” who are attracted to college 








the story in a 300-word letter to the 
editor. 

Suffice it to say here is that during 
the question and answer session, I 
asked Ressler a hard question concern- 
ing the Waco massacre. He evaded the 
question. After the lecture was over, I 
stood at the back of the line, giving all 
the fawners and sycophants their 
chance to get the great man’s auto- 
graph. When my turn came, we got 
into an argument wherein I wouldn't 
let Ressler have the last word. A man 
wearing a uniform wanted to lead me 
away to talk privately, then demanded 
identification. He wouldn't show me

hid his badge. Ressler sneaked away,

This is the eighth semester the 
Department of Communications has 
carried out a longitudinal study into 
those fears we call “communication 
apprehension.” While this also applies 
to personal speaking experiences in 
everyday life, our concern is primarily 
with the perceived fear of speaking to 
an audience. Maybe I can individualize 
this for each of you by saying, “You will 
stand alone, in front of an audience 
with more than 12 pair of eyes staring 
directly at you and the minds behind 




















those eyes are expecting you to share 
something different, interesting and/or 
valuable!” Can you relate to some per- 


search with more than 1,500 Oral 
Communication 100 students indicates 
it is closer to 76 percent. The average 
level of anxiety at the beginning of any 
given semester is between high and 
moderately high. By the end of the 
semester the students have lowered 
their anxiety an average of 20 points 
per student to moderately low and low 
anxiety 

We find that women consistently 
report higher anxiety about public 
speaking than do men. We also find 
that non-traditional students report 
higher anxiety than traditional stu- 
dents. In both these populations 
show more ave ange by the end 
of the semester, meaning they respond

about “whose 
stupid idea it 
was to do this 
in the first n

party responsible, I can only 
report that it seemed like a good 
idea at the time. 
Little did I know, back then, 
«the ominous connotations of the

Wasn't even that distressed 
when they wound up having to 
tear down half the house, 
although the neighbors were 
startled by it. But I was amazed 
when they came in one day to 
report they had located a 7-foot 
lake under the house. The pipes 
leak. Great — there's a drought 
in Central Texas, and I'm the 
only person in the area with a 
growing body of water on my

was almost run over by a car. In

Michael relieved his own feel-

Her neighbors clucked sympa-

“Noooo,” moaned Kilday, 
incurably honest. “The workers

the one who kept promising to 
“have a Mexican in every win-

think of the number of people 
who will never be attorney gen-

explained, he had made the mis-

so they'd all gotten drunk all

“But I'm not lettin’ him out of

clustered around the truck 
demanding to know how this

Abundance of 
Ph.D. degrees 


may limit work 
By JOYCE LAIN KENNEDY. 


SUN FEATURES INC 


ear Joyce: Now a junior 
in college, I'm thinking 
about pursuing a Ph.D. 


My concern is the availability of 
a job. How do you evaluate 
employment prospects?—W.RT. 

‘According to the establishment 
view, within the next several 
years the nation may run short 
earchers and college pro- 
sors in the arts and sciences. 
“In Pursuit of the Ph.D.,” a 
study by the head of the Andrew 
J. Mellon Foundation and the 
president of Harvard 
University, the number of doc- 
toral recipients in economics, 








English, history, mathematics, 
physics, and political science 
has definitively declined, from 
5,400 in 1973 to 3,600 in 1988. 

A related study, “Prospects for 


Sciences,” estimates; there may 
be just 30,934 new faculty mem- 
bers to fill 91 positions by 
the end of this decade 

My view: Trust the experts but 
cut the cards. I'm getting a few 
letters form readers who say 
they hold a Ph.D. but camou- 
flage the fact when job hunting, 
believing the doctorate to be a 
hindrance in landing positions 
outside academia or research 
Susan Weiner, 2 Miami writer 
who received her doctorate from 
Northwestern University, in a 
recent article disagreed with 
current claims that a shortage 
of researchers and professors is 
on the horizon. Weiner, who col- 
orfully describes the Ph.D. as 

















“rapidly becoming the Edsel of 
American education,” says the 
credential’s decline is because 
there are too few jobs

Faculty in the “Atts/ “abe! ©/face little prospect of evi 


dreds of applicants per faculty

When I advise you to cut the 
cards, I mean that you should 
practice the research skills 
you'll need to survive doctoral 
study. Conduct a first-hand 
investigation of job prospects by 
interviewing professors and 
researchers, and devour acade- 
mic trade publications. Some 
people who go back to school to 
obtain a doctorate are avoidance 
tripping, using study as a delay- 
ing Lactic to dodge the anxiety of 








the job market. Doctoral study 
may be an admirable way to fill 
time, but it should not be seen

are best for this?—Y.R.W. 

Computer science, engincer-

are the most direct educational 
pathways. A bachelor’s degree is

11 new members

at organization’s 
national meeting 


By DIANE VOLK 
CHART REPORTER 


issouri Southern’s soci 
ology honor society is 
the envy of colleges and 


universities across the country 
according to the group's adviser 

The Alpha Kappa Delta 
International Sociology Honor 
Society chapter at Southern is 
the sixth chapter in Missouri. It 
was granted that status three 
years ago. 

“We are a model for a lot of 
schools in the Southwest,” said 
Dr. Richard Miller, assistant 





ogy majors qualify for member- 
ship,” he said 

Eleven Southern students 
were recently initiated into the 
honor society: juniors Stephanie 
White, Nancy Coffer, Joan 
Wilson, Holly Coker, Kimberly 
Ludwig, Monica McPherson, 
and Beth Ostmeyer, and seniors 
Melissa Pefferman, Deborah 
Lazure, Karen Davis, and 
Brenda Hazley 

“AKD is not a club,” said 
Coker, AKD vice president and 
new initiate. “We are an honor 
society that wants to recognize 
the achievements of the stu- 
dents.” 

Once a year the honor society 
attends a national conference 
Next year’s conference is in San 


Antonio, Texas, March 30-April

Even though the Student 


AA AKD is not a club. We are an honor 
society that wants to recognize the 


achievements of the students. 


—Holly Coker, 


AKD vice president Ti 


professor of sociology and the 
society’s adviser. “I have been 
really fortunate to sit on the 
panel every year at regional 
conferences to hear what other 
schools are saying about our 
chapter.” 

To become an AKD chapter, a 
school must meet strict national 
requirements in terms of faculty 
and course offerings. Southern’s 
chapter is the only one to be 
granted in 15 years. 

“It took about six months of 
Just preparation to submit our 
School for a vete from the 
national board,” Miller said. 

To become a member, a stu- 
dent must have completed 
least 12 hours of sociology, have 
a minimum 3.0 grade-point 
average in sociology, and 3.0 
GPA overall 

“Less than 16 percent of sociol- 











Senate will provide $1,000 for 
the trip, “the money does not 
cover all the expenses,” Coker 

id 

“In order to meet the expense: 
AKD has a yearly bake sale,

Miller said this year’s confer- 
ce will be especially impor- 
nt to Southern's chapter 

“For the first time, a Southern 
student will be presenting a

Organization collecting food 


By SUSAN WATERS 
STAFF WRITER 


‘elping people find food is 
a service project of one 
campus organization 


this month. 

Koinonia, a campus ministry 
at Missouri Southern, is partici- 
pating in the Joplin church 
canned food drive to benefit the 
area homeless through Souls 
Harbor Mission 

“Giving Thanks for What One 
Has” is the theme for area 
churches this month. With this 
in mind, churches donate food to 
charitable organizations to help 
the homeless and needy 

*Souls’ Harbor is a Christian- 
oriented shelter that helps 
the area’s needy,” said Amy 











Johnson, student coordinator of 
the project. “The shelter stress- 
es that they want to help people 
get back on their feet and show 
the needy how to help them- 
selv 

“Job placement workers come 
in to the shelter frequently 
Souls’ Harbor is run solely on 
donations.” 

Johnson suggested Koinonia 
get involved in the drive after 
she visited Souls’ Harbor. This 
is the first year for the food 
drive 

The Koinonia food drive runs 
until Tuesday. Collection boxes 
are located in the Billingsly 
Student Center and Taylor Hall 
on campus. Other collection 
boxes are at Smitty's grocery 
store, 2707 E. 32nd, and College 





Heights Chnstian Church. 

David Weaver, campus minis- 
ter, said the club hopes to col- 
lect 500 canned goods. He 
stressed the need for baby food, 
because many of the homeless 
are parents with children. 

“We'd like to challenge other 
clubs to participate,” Weaver 
said. “It would be neat to see 
those boxes filled up.” 

Johnson, a junior elementary 
education major, will deliver the 
food on Tuesday. Any extra food 
or cash will go toward stocking 
the shelves at Souls’ Harbor 

“I would like to encourage peo- 
ple to bring something every 
other day,” Weaver said 

Koinonia also will help serve a 
Thanksgiving dinner at S 
Harbor.

COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT 


Center assists speech students 


By SUSAN WATERS 
STAFF WRITER 


tudents often need help in 
Sis preparation beyond 

thet available in the class- 
room. The purpose of the com- 
munications resource center is 
to meet this need. 

“When I went to graduate 
school, the college had a speech 
Jab, and it was very beneficial,” 
said Dr. J.R. Moorman, supervi- 
sor. 

“Students who are anxio' 
about giving speeches can prac- 
tice here,” he said. 

The center, located in Rooms 
344-350 of Webster Hall, will 
remain open throughout the 
semester. Hours are 10 a.m. to 
11 am. 2nd 1 p.m. to3 p.m 
Monday, 2 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 
10:45 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

a.m. to 10 a.m. and 10:45am 
to 12:30 p.m. Thursday, and9 
a.m. to 11 a.m. Friday. Ap- 
pointments for other times can 
be made with Moorman at Ext 
105 

“I have six students who staff 
the center,” Moorman said. 
“One, Mr. Juan Figueroa, isa 
native speaker of Spanish and 
can be an excellent resource if 
you need help with Spanish out: 
side of the classroom.” 

Figueroa is available from 8 
a.m. to 9 a.m. Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday andj 
p.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday and 
Thursday. He also canibe 
reached at 624-1738. 

The staff of student mentors 
comes from the communications 
department and is screened ng 
trained by Moorman 

Mentors are juniors or seninrs, 
and receive one hourllf 
Practicum credit. yj

“One of the student mentors 
had a blind student that he met 
with regularly,” Moorman said 
<The student mentor would 
*¥ou see what I mean,’ and the 
blind student would say ‘No’ 
This was a learning experience 
for both of them.” 

Shad Youngblood, a senior 
communications major, is credit- 
cdiwith helping get the center 
started. 

“[ess than 10 students use the 
center per week,” Moorman 
said. “We would like students to 
feellfree to uso the center any- 
time, not just when there is 
some difficulty 

“We would like to continue and 

d our services by using the 
orPrral system,” he added. “We 
jould|like more outreach and 
tventually would like to staff 
the center for 40 hours per 
week” 











“The group was originally 
going to start three semesters 
ago,” Tarrant-Biancalana said 
“But things came up, and the 
last two semesters it seemed to 
disappear. 

“One of the goals is for single 
parents to provide moral sup- 
port to other single parents,” 
she said. “We want to let these 
parents know that they aren't 
alone. 

*Within the group we're hop- 
ing to find the h 
need. If someone is having trou- 
ble in a math class, maybe 
her member will be able to 
1p them.” 

Although the group currently 
numbers about 20, Tarrant-

ers in the group,” she said. “I 
know that there are some single

if they are interested they won't 
be afraid to contact us.

Custom-made device works 


to correct area man’s disease 


By KEVIN McCLINTOCK 
STAFF WRITER 


rt and medical science are 
teaming up at Missouri 
Southern’s art depart- 


ment to fight the symptoms of a 
rare disease 

Peggy McCullum, senior art 
major, is putting the finishing 
touches on her “cosmetic jewel- 
ry,” a device to relieve the pain 
and suffering of Jonathan 
Hobbs, a Pittsburg, Kan., native, 
has had to deal with for more 
than two years. 

McCullum said the idea to help 
Hobbs came unexpectedly one 
morning when a doctor in 
Kansas City contacted Garry 
Hess, assistant professor of art. 

“People from all over were try- 
ing to find somebody at PSU to 
make something for this man,” 
McCullum said, “since he lived 
in Pittsburg. Yet their jewelry 
department either didn't have 
the time or didn't want to mess 
with it, so they tuned to us. Mr. 
Hess got the phone call and 
decided to give the job to me” 

Though the idea to aid Hobbs 
was not McCullum’s, the device 
she created a month later was 

“The task, surprisingly, was 
quite simple,” s “I was 
told that the man had some sort 
of disease that had crippled his 
hand, and I was to make some- 
thing that would enable him to 
separate the fingers and to ele- 
vate them. 

*I made a piece of custom-fit 
jewelry that hopefully will do the 
job. From an artistic standpoint, 

















the challenge was pretty easy.” 

The device, which resembles 
brass knuckles, consists of three 
band-rings attached to each 
other, enabling the curled fin- 
Bers to be lifted up into a more 
natural position. This not only 
relieves pain and stimulates 
blood flow, but on a more person 
al level, makes the overall pic 
ture much prettier to look at. 

“In other words,” McCullum 
said, “here Jonathan has some- 
thing for the very first time that 
isn’t obvious and bulky and 
clunky and doesn't take up his 
whole arm and look simply atro- 
ious; but instead is much small. 
er and has texture and designs 
that make the tool look like 
three harmless, little rings 
does the same thing a big, 
brace does.” 

McCullum hopes her device 
will raise some eyebrows in the 
medical field. 

*You never know what this 
might turn into,” she said “This 
may be something doctors in 
other cities and states might 
want for their patients. 

“And the money I'd receive 
from all of this wouldn't hurt. 
either” 

When a template « 
pedic jewelry was made and 
Hobbs tried it on for the first 
time, he experienced a sensati 
his battered hand had forgott 
long ago—relief from the con- 
stant, burning pain 

“To be honest with you, my 
hand has been in this curled con: 
dition for more than two years,” 
Hobbs said. “When that device

here is still one more 
weekend to catch a perfor 
mance of The Diaries of 


Adam and Eve at Stone's Throw 
Dinner Theatre in Carth: 
“Adam and Eve do wear 
clothes in this comedy,” said 
director Henry Heckert. “So it is 
Suitable for the whole family.” 
The play is by Samuel L. 
Clemens, better known as Mark 
‘Twain. It runs today and tomor- 
row, with dinner at 6:30 p.m. 
and curtain at 7:30 p.m. On 
Sunday, dinner at is at 1 p.m.

information. 





“We are doing this delightful 








retelling f earth's 
first fai efit for the 
theatre,” Heckert said. “We 





have two major projects which 
need to be completed: the pur- 
chase of a new kitchen range 











and the ceiling in the main eec-

would rather not go a-begging, 








so this special pro on is

The Biblical story is retold by 
Twain through “dairies” kept by 
Adam and Eve about the first 
days of Creation. Much of the 
story is tongue-in-cheek 

“Most people who know me 
probably came to the show 
expecting to see me as the rep- 
tile. But I don't play that part or 
the Lord God Almighty,” 
Heckert said 

The play is a two-pe

The theatre dates back to 1928 
with the formation of the 
Carthage Music Club. In the 
1960s, the club joined with the 
Carthage Rotary Club and per- 
formed the best of Broadway at 
various schools and at Memorial

Open house features initiation of 8 new members 


Youths, parents 
treated to tour 
of department 


By T. ROB BROWN. 
ASSOCIATE EDITOR 


aw enforcement hopefuls 
ages 14-20 met Monday 
for an open house spon- 


sored by the Joplin Police 
Department Explorers Post. 

Eight new members were 
accepted to join the 23 current 
members. Prospective members 
and their parents were given a 
tour of the Joplin police station 
and treated to a demonstration 
by the department's drug dog, 
“Kid.” 

Advisers introduced the new 
members ta some of the pro- 
grams and activities offered by 

















this Explorers post 
“Explorers participate in ride- 
alongs through their volunteer 


how id Cpl. Geoff Jones of 
Joplin Police Department's traf- 
fic division and Explorers Post 
adviser. 

The ride-along program offers 
Explorers the opportunity to 
ride with an officer for up to 10 
hours. Members earn opportu- 
nities to ride by volunteering 12 
hours a month to the police 
department. A second ride may 
be earned when they volunteer 
30 hours 





Several Missouri Southern 
students are involved in the 
post. 

“I really enjoy the Explorers 
program, especially the ride- 
alongs,” said Suzanne Hale, 
freshman criminal justice major 
and Explorers member. “I like 
the excitement. My favorite part 
is when we turn on the lights 
and sirens and go through the 
red lights for emergency calls.” 

She said she liked being with 
the officers and hearing their 
stories 

Mike Williams, freshman 
criminal justice major and 
Explorers member, said many 
things could happen on a ride- 


ers via Field Interrogation 
Cards. 

“An officer fills one out on any- 
one acting suspicious or 
involved in a crime,” he said 
“That information's entered in a 
computer. The Explorers help 
with the entry. They enter other 
information into computers, 
they answer telephones, and 
they perform any other tasks 
needed by the department. They 
perform the non-hazardous 
details.” 

They assist the officers at con- 
certs, parades, carnivals, and 
many other events, he said 

“The whole goal of Explorers is 
to train the young adults in the

the hospital. Then we had a few

with Joplin city officials. 

Patty Bowman, head of the E-

the plan was not concise and no

“simply because it was not a

One of the more critical sub-

about last week was how the E- 
911 system would be funded. 
“Right now, we're discussing

after last week's meeting, it 
looks like it will be the sales

Enhanced 911 differs from 
other emergency systems in 
that it can display onto a com- 
puter screen not only the tele- 
phone number of the person

son's address and first and last

The committee's next steps 
include talks with community

crs. 

“One of our committee mem- 
bers is putting a budget togeth-

forward so we would know

“And we're also planning to set

simply by dialing that number

Hood: no 
reason to 
eat flesh 


CHART REPORTER 


right not to suffer? Paul 
Hood, senior English 
ajor, believes so 


“I think that the suffering and 
death caused by our treatment 
of animals is only matched by 
the institution of slavery,” he 
said. “In fact, I think there are 
some real similarities between 
them which makes people a lit- 
tle uncomfortable, but it is a 
reality.” 

Hood believes that who is suf- 
fering is irrelevant; if suffering 
exists, it is wrong. 

*I do not think animals are 
our tools. I do not think we 
should use them like renewable 
ces,” he said. “Scientists 
do that when they research on 
them, and farmers do that 
when they send them off to a 
slaughter house. 

“In fact, when scientists order 
products the animals are listed 
on a resource sheet the same 
way paper clips or files would 
be,” he said 

It was not until three years 
ago that he d red his 
beliefs in relation to animal 
rights. Hood had a philosophy 
class with Dr. Barry Brown 

ant professor of philoso- 
phy, that exposed him to both 
sides of the

to die for that trivial of a 
human reason.” 

After studying animal rights 
in his philosophy class, he 
decided to become a vegetarian. 
He went home that night and 
discovered for himself that 
meat cating is a trained habit 

“Thad already put a hot dog in 
the microwave and was heating 
it up because I had been 
trained just like everybody 
else,” Hood said. 

He believes more people 
would become vegetarians if 
they could make an informed 
choice around the ages of 9 or 
10. 








Some people argue that being 
a vegetarian means eating 
nothing but salad. Hood thinks 
there are many foods people can 
cat as vegetarians 

“There are a variety of things 
you can eat,” he said. “It is just 
that people expect to have flesh 
when they eat, so they think 
there is nothing else left to eat 
out there. If you start looking 
around, there are. There are 
lots of things besides just gar-

“I like spaghetti, and there is

she said. 

“He makes Music Theory eas- 
ier. He involves everyone with- 
out embarrassing anyone 

“What L like most about 
Southern is the people. They're 
friendly. The teachers, my 
friends, everyone. And the 
facilities are great, especially 
the music department. It’s 
always growing. Every time I 
come back there's something 
new.” 

As to the future, Valencia 
believes she will move back to

teaching, married, and own a 
pet store 

“I've always had a thing for 
pet stores,” she said. “One day, 
Isat in a pet store all day and 
watched the children come in. 
It was incredible. They (the 
children and animals) were so 
sweet.”

he Missouri Southern foot- 
| ‘ball team clinched sole 
possession of its first Mid- 
America Intercollegiate Athle- 
ties Association championship 
Saturday with a 49-33 victory 
over Northwest Missouri State 
in Maryville. 

“Our offense was tremendous, 
and the defense played hard,” 
Head Coach Jon Lantz said 
“Albert Bland stepped it up 
another notch after halftime.” 











Bland finished the contest 
with 211 yards rushing on 29 
carries. Blocking back Jared 
Kaaniobelo continues to be out of 
the lineup with an injury suf- 
fered Oct. 30 against 
Washburn. Lantz said the 
injury has forced the Lions into 
an almost full-time spread 
offense 

“| attribute that to realizing 
that there are two ways to skin 
a cat,” Lantz said. “You don't 
haye to be in the I-formation 
with a tight end to run the ball. 

“We're rushing more like 
Thurman Thomas (Buffalo 
Bills) than like Marcus Allen 
(Kansas City Chiefs) rushes the 
ball. To be able to switch mid- 
season is a credit to our offen- 

sive line.”

Cook completed 17 of 29 passes 
for 227 yards and one touch- 
down. Wide receiver Rod Smith 
caught four passes for 44 yards 
and threw a touchdown pass to 
Gerald Brewer in the first 
quarter. 

The Lion defense allowed 33 
points, but Lantz said that is 
not representative of the team. 

“The defense has stopped our 
opponent when we needed to,” 
he said. “The last touchdows 
that have been scored against 
us have been mostly meaning- 
less. 

“Those points were a lot more 
important to Northwest, Rolla, 
and Washburn than they were 
to us. Sometimes I think the 
final scores are misleading” 

‘The win gives Southern (9-0-1 
overall, 9-0 MIAA) first place in 

















the MIAA, one game ahead of 
Pittsburg State (8-2, 8-1). 

“We've had to look over our 
shoulders for eight or nine 
weeks,” Lantz said. “To do that 
and stay focused is tough, and 
I'm proud of our young men for 
their ability to do that.” 

The last four victories have 
come against teams with a com- 
bined record of 9-32. 

“The last time we really played 
dominantly was Central Mis- 
souri,” Lantz said 

Lantz said many people are 
not giving Southern the credit it 
deserves for an undefeated regu- 
Jar season, 

“I think I hear it from people 
like Tom Van Hoy (KKOW-AM, 
Pittsburg, Kan.) and people 
around who are really not in our 
corner,” he said “Those will be 














the people if we finally lose a 
game who will stand up and 
say, ‘Sec, you really weren't 
that good.’ 

“My opinion is that we've been 
good enough to not lose any 
games this year.”

CHAD. HAYWORTH 


Pardon me 
while | gloat 
over title 


ow happy am | that 
IH Pittsburg State Uni- 

versity is not the the 
MIAA football champion for 
the zillionth year in a row? 
And I'm not the only one 

Heading into Maryville on 
Saturday, | tuned into 
KNIM, the voice of the 
Northwest Missouri State 
Bearcals. The announcers, 
despite their obvious desire 
for a Bearcat win, seemed 
to gloat almost as much as 
| was that there would be 
no joy in Gorillaville that 
day 

Even Rod Smith, South- 
ern's all-world receiver, got 
caught up in the euphoria 

“Look at this,” he said, 
pointing to the MIAA trophy 
he cradled in his arms like a 
newborn. “It doesn't say 
Co-champs' on it any- 
where.” 

Now, Saturday's game did 
show me some things | 
didn't want to see, nor did | 
ever expect | would see. 

Take, for example, the flat 
football the Northwest ball- 
boys inserted into the 
game. During the second 
quarter, the ballboys took 
‘one of the approved game 
balls and replaced it with 
what appeared to be just 
another fairly new football 

Hardly. {t was as flat as 
western Kansas, To the 
credit of the officials, it 
probably was used only 
about three or four plays be 
fore they caught’on. 

Now, | would never say 
Northwest purposely insert- 
ed the flat, non-approved 
football, so draw your own 
assumptions. 

Or how about this one 
While taking pictures on the 
sidelines, | consistently kept 
funning into a gentleman 
who obviously was a little 
less than objective about 
Saturday's outcome. He 
was decked out head-to-toe 
in Bearcat attire, although 
he should have gotten a 
skirt and some pom-pons. 

“Goo00000000000000000 
Bearcats. Let's stop ‘em 
heeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrerr- 
eeeceeeee.” 


Uh, excuse me, but 
g000000000000000 sit in 
the stands. I'm trying to 
work here. 

Now to be fair, incidents 
like this happen at 


Southern, too. Folks with 
team bench passes consis- 
tently find their way into the 
press area during the 
game. But at least they 
don't scream “Gooooo0000 
Lions” every 10 seconds. 

Looking ahead to this 
week's first-ever NCAA 
football playoff game for the 
Lions, | foresee an all-out 
track meet. 

The Souther defense has 
gotten into the habit of rely- 
ing on the big play to stop 
ils opponents when it has to 
and then hoping the offense 
can light up the scoreboard 
with enough points to win 
Now, it has worked well to 
this point, but if Southern 
continues to give up 400+ 
yards Week in and week 
‘out, it makes it a tough row 
to hoe. 

Mankato is by far the best 
team Southern has seen all 
season, and the Lions will 
have to step up on both 
side of the ball when they 
hit the field Saturday. Not 
that they can't win; in fact, 
the home-field advantage 
and the confidence of nine 
straight victories should 
Qive the Lions all the confi- 
dence they need, but this 
one won't be a cakewalk

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW 





Lady Lions o 


By CHAD HAYWORTH 
EXECUTIVE EDITOR 


espite the loss of last 
ear’s three top scorers, 
the Lady Lion basketball 


squad should be every bit as good 
jas the 27-4 team of a year ago, 
|said Carrie Kaifes, assistant 
| coach, 

| “We expect good things for us 
| this season,” she said. “The peo- 
ple we have brought in are as tal- 
jented, if not more so, than what 
| we lost.” 

| The Lady Lions must replace 
|starters Rolanda Gladen (18.6 
|points per game, 9.6 rebounds 
|per game) and Nancy Somers 




















(13.5 ppg., 2.6 rpg) in addition to 
three-point threat Christina 
Ortega (9 ppg.) and Dana 
Presley (2.9 ppg, 1.5 rpg) 

The Lady Lions are ranked 
20th nationally in a pre-season 
poll 

However, Missouri Southern is 
by no means short on experi- 
ence. Junior college transfers 
Sonya Harlin, who sat out last 
sedson with a knee injury, Karen 
Wunderlich, and Melissa Grider 
should help to fill the holes in 
the Lady Lion roster, Kaifes 
said. Grider will not be eligible 
until the second semester.

Tucker to pace 


Lions’ attack 
Season opener tomorrow 


By JEFFREY SLATTON. 
ASSOCIATE EDITOR 


Ithough much of the 
campus is still buzzing 
wer the Southern foot- 


ball team, the men’s basketball 
squad will make its debut at 
7:30 p.m. tomorrow against 
Pittsburg State University 
Gorillas in Young Gymnasium. 

“The success of our football 
team speaks for the entire 
College,” Head Coach Robert 
Corn said 

“We are supportive of them 
and hope they win the national 
championship.” 

Last year, Southern compiled 
a 21-10 record and won the 
MIAA tournament champi- 
onship over regular-season 
champion Washburn. 

But the Lions lost five players 
to graduation: Demarko Mc- 
Cullough (6-foot-5, 18.8 points, 
6.3 rebounds), Ron Joyner (5- 
11, 12.8, 2.3), Keith Allen (5-10, 
4.1, 12), Mike Doman (6-7, 3.0, 
3.3), and Tony Jackson (6-7, 
2.5, 2.3) 

Corn said he believes the 
returning players will be able 
to pick up the slack. 

“We have several people com- 
ing back this year with college 
experience,” he said. “Add the 
six new guys, and we really 
have a good base.” 

The biggest returning player 
is senior forward Chris Tucker 
(6-9, 16.6, 9.5) 

“He's developed his outside 
game,” Corn said. “In the past 
he had shown flashes of being 
able to play from the outside, 
but he was our only inside 
threat. It was obvious at the 
Midnight Madness scrimmage 
that Chris had expanded his 
game. 

“We rer this year than 
ee we will Tet'him 
move outside more.” 








to be able to do the job for us,” 
she said. “Our go-to person will 
be whoever happens to be hot on 

a given night.” 

Kaifes said Harlin, a junior col- 
lege All-America two years ago, 
was a player to watch 

*She's very explosive,” she said 
“Sonya can shoot the ‘3’ one trip 
down the floor and turn around 
and drive the lane the next.” 

Harlin’s knee injury seems to 
have healed successfully, Kaifes 
said 

“It's a little sore sometimes,” 
she said. “But this is also the 
first time since high school she 
has been able to play without a 
brace on her knee 

“We still haven't seen all Sonya 
can do. She's still a little hesi- 
tant.” 

Trudy Youngblood, a freshman 
from Alpena, Ark., withdrew 
from school earlier this semes- 
ter, leaving the Lady Lions with 
Just three post players. Seniors 
Honey Scott and Cindy Bricker 
and newcomer sophomore 


















A We expect good things 
for us this season. The 


people we have brought in 
are as talented, if not 
more so, than what we 


lost. 


Assistant Coach Carrie Kaifes 99 | 


Wunderlich will have to fill the 
gap, Kaifes said 

“We can only play five players 
at any one time,” she said. “We 
Just have to make sure and not 
get into foul trouble in the post” 

Senior Jennifer Charleston is 
also listed as a guard-forward, 
but she plays more toward the 
top of the key. 

“What we have tried to do is set 
it up so Charlie isn't in s posi- 
tion where she has to play with 
her back to the basket,” Kaifes 
said. “She can do a lot of things 
for us out on top.” 

Another concern for Southern 
is the lack of practice time to 
Prepare for Tuesday's opener 





Corn said the new players 
should add stability to the team 

‘We've added two junior col- 
lege players to our roster, and 
any time you do that, you expect 
them to be impact players,” 
Corn said. “Kyle Hardin (5-8 
Junior, Forest Park Community 
College) and Terrance Sisson (6- 
4 Junior, Western Nebraska 
Community College) are both 
capable of stepping in 

sWe've also|added a transfer, 
Caleb Rath (6-10 sophomore, 
Evansville), with (NCAA] 
Division I experience. He will 
continue to get better and bet- 
ter” 

Saturday, Southern scrim- 
maged Team Aerial Assault of 
Kansas City, an AAU team, and 
won 104-71 at Young Gymna- 
sium. Corn said/he was happy 
with the performance. 

“Twas pleased with the first- 
half play of our defense,” Corn 
Said 

“We don't have a gauge for our 
defense while scrimmaging. 

sThe effort was good, we exe- 
cuted our offense well, and we 
held’ them to 71 points. 
Everyone who played did’ posi- 
tive things.” 

Tucker paced the Lions with 
25 points and 20 rebounds, and 
Sisson added 23 points 

In the pre-season MIAA coach- 
€s' poll, Southern was rated sec- 
ond| behind Central Missouri 
State 

*CMSU was rated first mostly 
based on their recruiting cla: 
but that all remains to be scen,” 
Corn said. “Bob Sundvold will 
do a great job, and Central will 
have a great team.” 

Defending regular-season 
champion Washburn was rated 
third. 

“Washburn is always going to 
be good,? Corn, snidge-Boby 
Chipman does a good job. They. 
will play hard and be ve. 





pen with Pitt: 


with Pittsburg State University 
in Young Gymnasium 

“We've had some nagging 
injuries early on,” Kaifes said 
*Grider has been fighting a 
groin pull, and Honey Scott has 
had a slight hip injury.” 

Kaifes said Tuesday was the 
time this year the enti 
m had been able to practice 
together. 

The Lady Lions face a tough 
opener in the Gorillas. PSU is 
ranked 15th nationally and 
returns two starters, including 
sophomore Lisa Cropper, who 
was an all-MIAA freshman pick 
a year ago. 

*Opening with PSU is certain- 
ly going to be a tough test,” 
Kaifes said. “But win or los

“The conference always comes

said

Pittsburg State was picked 
12th in the pre-season poll. 

“certainly did not pick them 
to finish last," Corn said. “But I 
know how that feels.” 

In 1989-90, Corn’s first season 
with the Lions, they were 
picked last only to finish fifth. 

“I think Pittsburg State is 
capable of finishing higher,” he 
said. 

“They will be very similar to

Frozen in time

early everyone who was 
alive when President 
John Kennedy was ass- 


assassinated remembers where 
they were and what they were 
doing when they heard the 
report 

Carolyn Billingsley, secretary 
to College President Julio Leon, 
said she was working at the old 
Joplin Junior College when the 
news came over the radio. 

“We used the intercom system 
to put the word out,” Billings- 
ley said: “We very seldom used 
the intercom to interrupt class, 
so that was unusual. It became 
reall quiet—nobody could 
believe it. Several instructors 
came to the office to try to find 
out more about the assassina- 
tion.” 

Dr. John Tiede, senior vice 
president, was a freshman at 
the University of Missouri- 
Rolla 

“It was a Friday, and I was 
coming home on a bus when I 














heard the news,” Tiede said. “It 
was kind of surreal. You knew 
it had to be real, yet you still 
couldn't believe it.” 

Tiede said Kennedy's image is 
frozen in time for many people 

“You have this picture of a 
young person, when in reality 
he would have been in his 70s.”

news. It was kind of surreal. You

College President Julio Leon 
was in Santiago, Chile, when he 
heard the news 

“I was teaching elementary 
school when another teacher 
came in and told me about it,” 
he said. “He was very popular 
in Latin America. He was a 
young president, and he was 
Catholic. Latin America is pri- 
marily Catholic. The people also

freshman Shawna Ketron. 
Others say he his impact on

cans

chie said. “He made a lot of 
things possible.” 

‘Some of the programs Ken- 
nedy created are still helping 
people around the world, 

“He started the Peace Corps, 
so he can't be all bad,” said 
sophomore art major Eric 
Sweet, “but then again the 
Peace Corps could be viewed as 
peaceful imperialism.” 

Some students believe he was 
killed before he accomplished 
his full potential 

“The fact that he was assassi- 
nated really affected this coun- 
try,” said sophomore Gordon 
LaForte, 55, who was in the 
Navy from 1957-7 

*It changed the direction of 
the country. Vietnam probably 
would not have lasted as long 

“If he had lived|he probably 
would have been reelected,” 
LaForte said. "Just think where 
we could be today.”

RAVALYSIS & 


By JOHN HACKER 
EDITORAIN-CHIEF 


ike many people, | have read books and 
watched programs and documentaries 


about the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy. 

The facts appear, on the surface, to be clear. 
Lee, Harvey Oswald took a rifle to a sixth-floor 
window of the Texas School Book Depository 
and shot President Kennedy and Texas Gov. 
John Connally from behind. | believed that 
account for many years, but | don't any more. 

The fact is Oswald never got his day in court. 
His murder by Jack Ruby prevented a tnal which 
would have brought the evidence into the open 
and settled the case of Oswald's guilt or inno- 
cence. As it stands now, Oswald never was con- 
victed of the crime, so no matter what the evi- 
dence indicates, he is innocent. 

The government made a number of mistakes 
immediately after the assassination. Taking 
Kennedy's body from Parkland Hospital in viola- 
tion of Texas state law wes a big faux pas. 
Parkland Hospital had some of the best cnminal 
pathologists in the U.S. at the time. These were 
doctors who had seen countless gunshot 
wounds and would know an entrance wound 
from an exit wound. The body was taken to 
Bethesda Naval Hospital in Virginia. Very few 
doctors at Bethesda had ever conducted an 
autopsy, The Warren Commission approached 
this investigation with the assumpiion that 
Oswald was guilty. It ignored a number of vital 

pieces of evidence and eyewiness testimony 
that indicated Oswald may have done it but did 
not act alone. The one thing that totally discred- 
its the Warren Commission, in my mund, is its 
attempt to peddle this outrageous “magic bullet 
[ theory’ The idea that this one bullet traveled 





Assassination picture still muddy 


through two people and caused seven separate 
wounds and emerged practically undamaged is 
completely unrealistic. In the photos of 
Kennedy's body and clothes taken immediately 
after the body arrived in Virginia, there isn't even 
a wound where the Commission says the bullet 
entered his neck—tt is six inches below the neck 
between the shoulder blades. 

Another strike against the “magic bullet” is that 
immediately alter Kennedy was declared dead, 
Parkland doctors said the wound in the front of 
his neck was an entrance wound. This indicates 
shots fired from in front of Kennedy's motor- 
cade. These are just a few of the problems | have 
with the “official” version of what happened. 
Conspiracy theorists have some compelling argu- 
ments, but they are by no means perfect either. 

My biggest problem is when they claim that 
Hugh Aynesworth, a respected joumalist with the 
Dallas Moming News is a government informant 
in the pay of the CIA or the FBI, depending on 
whom you talk to. Aynesworth covered the arrest 
of Oswald and district attomey Jim Gamison's 
efforts in New Orleans that were chronicled in 
the movie JFK. | had the opportunity to talk with 
Aynesworth last month. He told me not to listen 
to him or the conspiracy theonsts. He said to 
look at the evidence and make up my own mind. 

Well, | have, and I've concluded that I don't 
think Oswald did it alone. However, we will never 
know what actually happened until a completely 
unbiased, independent invesbgation is made of 
all the evidence, including that still locked up and 
kept confidential. Even then we may not know 
what really happened, but the effort must be 
made, because if these conspiracy theories are 
even close to what actually happened, the peo- 
ple who covered it up may still be in the gover- 

ment 

And that scares me mast of all.

lhe assassination of Pres-

big burden of guilt on the 

city where it happened 

Dallas has worked for years to 
overcome the stigma left by the 
assassination and the resulting 
media coverage 

People in Dallas in November 
1963 expected some kind of trou- 
ble because of the aty’s extreme- 
ly conservative leaning at the 
ome 

“We actually expected trouble 
on his visit to Dallas, said 
Darwin Payne, former reporter 
for the Dallas Times-Herald. 
“We anticipated an embarrass-

Dallas deals with guilt 


ing incident—we did not antic- 
pate an assassination.” 

Kennedy did not enjoy the pop- 
ularity in life he has had in 
death 

“He was not the hero icon he is 
now,” said Mike Cochran, re- 
porter for the Associated Press. 
“He was just another politician 
Dallas was hostile to Kennedy at 
the time.” 

Cochran said the assassination 
along with an incident about a 
month before in which then- 
U.N. Ambassador Adlai Steven- 
son was attacked by protesters 
and hit with a sign forced some 
soul-searching among residents 
of Dallas. 

“There was some regret that 
those on the extreme right had 





been so vocal,” he said. “There 
had been efforts to overcome the 
reputation. After the 
ssination, there was a great 
city-wide effort to become more 
moderate.” 

Bill Sloan, conspiracy theorist 
and author, said the guilt per- 
sisted for some time 

“It has somewhat passed, but 
even as recently as 15!years ago 
the city was thinking of tearing 
the [Texas School) Book] 
Depository down,” Sloan said 

The guilt is unjustified, he said. 

“They were going to kill 
Kennedy somewhere,” Sloan 
said. “There was a plot in 
Chicago, and in Miami officials 
disrupted another plot. Dallas is 
an insignificant happenstance.”

The Matchup 
Mankato State, Southern mirror each other 


By JEFFREY SLATTON 


ASSOGATEEDITOR: 
irror, mirror on the 
istics cash 
region will be the next 

to fall? 
When No. 12 Mankato State 





travels to Joplin tomorrow to 
take on No Missouri 
Southern, both teams may be 
staring into a mirror. 

“Both teams have great quar- 
terbacks that throw the football 
and are excellent leaders,” said 
Head Coach Dan Runkle. “Both 
have receivers that can make 
the big reception. Both have 
running backs that are capable, 
and both have defenses that 
have given up a lot of yards and 
points.” 

Southern Head Coach Jon 
Lantz also sees the similarities. 

“They are the closest team to 
us that we've faced all year,” he 
said. 

Mankato State runs a pass- 
oriented offense headed by 
senior quarterback Jamie Pass, 
‘who has completed 219 of 396 

for 3,142 yards and 25, 


“Pass is a good player, he's 


very mobile, looks like he has a 








r,” Lantz said 
counters with \ 
4 of 290 for 2.3 





Cook (1 
yards and 24 TDs). 
“Matt Cook does: 
Rod Smith to 
Runkle ssid. “Southern has 
Several talented receivers.” 

Mankato’s running attack 
features a tande of Eric 
Skow (640 yards), Pass (395 
yards), and Mark Erickson 
(310 yards) 

Since the loss of fullback 
Jared Kaaiohelo on Oct. 30, 
the Lions’ running attack has 
centered around sophomore 
Albert Bland (804 yards), 

Runkle said the outcome may 
hinge on which team can pin 
the other deep in its own terri- 
tory. 

“The key may be which team 
can create short fields offen- 
sively,” be said. “Neither team
