MBA  TO  BUILD  NEW  GYMNASIUM 


Tennis  Courts  In 
Hi;  Ilnsiirfiirnil 

The  M.B.A.  tennis  courts  will 
soon  be  completely  resurfaced  to 
give  the  Maroon  netters  the  finest 
playing  surface  in  the  city,  thanks 
to  the  Board  of  Trustees  who  re- 
cently gave  the  go-ahead  sign  for 
the  work.  The  resurfacing  job 
is  due  to  get  underway  as  soon  as 
the  material  arrives  from  the 
Rubien  Company  of  Westfield, 
New  Jersey,  builders  of  the  fam- 
ous Rubico  courts.  The  company 
will  send  a representative  to 
Nashville  to  oversee  the  laying  of 
the  first  court  and  to  train  a 
group  of  workmen  sufficiently  to 
enable  them  to  complete  the  job. 
The  five  Rubico  courts  will  give 
M.B.A.  one  of  the  finest  tennis 
plants  of  any  school  in  the  south 
and  should  do  much  to  bring  ten- 
nis interest  to  an  all-time  high  at 
the  Harding  Road  school.  Mr. 
Russell  Brothers,  Sr.  and  Board 
Chairman  John  Sloan  were  re- 
sponsible for  the  movement  which 
resulted  in  this  work. 

The  M.B.A.  courts  were  first 
surfaced  in  1945  and  for  the  past 
several  years  a small  amount  of 
Rubico  has  been  added  to  keep 
them  in  playable  condition.  Con- 
stant loss  of  the  material  due  to 
erosion  made  the  resurfacing  nec- 
essary if  the  school  was  to  main- 
tain all-weather  courts. 

The  tennis  season  is  expected 
to  be  under  way  before  the  courts 
are  completely  finished,  but  Coach 
Jim  Rule  hopes  to  be  able  to  ob- 
tain the  Belle  Meade  Courts  for 
practice  until  the  job  is  done.  His

Four  seniors  were  recently  in- 
ducted into  Totomoi,  the  highest 
honor  society  on  the  campus,  in  a 
tapping  ceremony  held  at  the 
morning  assembly  program. 

Honored  by  the  club  were 
Tommy  Frist,  Henry  Hurt,  Dick 
Sobel  and  Phil  Williams.  Frist 
was  named  due  to  his  outstand- 
ing work  in  athletics  and  foren- 
sics, Hurt  and  Williams  in  athlet- 
ics and  student  government  while 
Sobel  was  qualified  due  to  his 
work  in  scholarship,  athletics, 
forensics  and  publications. 

Tapping  ceremonies  were  in 
charge  of  the  present  active  mem- 
bers, President  Ivan  Brown,  Vice- 
President  Mack  Rolfe  and  Secre- 
tary-Treasurer Frankie  Drowota, 
assisted  by  several  alumni  mem-

Reed  Elected  Key  Club 
Lieutenant  Governor 

Brad  Reed,  pres:dent  of  M.B.A.’s 
junior  class  has  received  yet  an- 
other honor  to  add  to  his  long  list 
of  accomplishments.  At  the  meet- 
ing of  the  Fourteenth  Division 
(Nashville)  of  Key  Club  Inter- 
national, Reed  was  chosen  to  head 
the  division  during  the  coming 
year.  By  an  impressive  pulrality 
of  votes  over  the  other  candidates, 
Brad  swept  to  the  highest  Divis- 
ion office. 

Nominated  by  “Boomin'  Dick” 
Sobel,  M.B.A.’s  candidate  was 
spoken  for  by  the  school  orator. 
Thomas  Feam  Frist,  Jr.  Despite 
such  capable  speakers.  Brad  was 
elected  on  his  merits  and  the  vote 
of  the  overwhelming  M.B.A.-West 
coalition.  The  Key  Club  has 
chosen  a very  capable  leader  who 
will  be  a credit  both  to  the  club 
and  to  our  school. 


Who  Prnl’its? 

M.B.A.  has  been  numbered 
among  the  schools  that  have  suf- 
fered from  the  recent  wave  of 
vandalism  of  the  city.  While  the 
amount  of  damage  here  has  not 
been  near  the  destruction  suf- 
fered by  some  other  schools  it 
has  none  the  less  been  more  than 
should  happen  to  any  school. 
Rocks  have  been  hurled  through 
windows  on  numerous  occasions 
with  the  regult  that  as  many  as 
fifteen  windows  were  broken  in 
one  night.  It  is  the  belief  of  the 
majority  of  students  that  this 
damage  has  been  done  by  non- 
students of  the  school. 


must  qualify  In  two  or  more  fields 
of  activity  for  membership.  The 
club  is  limited  to  no  more  than 
20  percent  of  each  senior  class. 
Members  of  the  junior  class  who 
can  qualify  can  be  inducted  dur- 
ing the  last  term  of  their  junior 
year. 

The  Bell  Ringer  staff  salutes 
these  recent  inductees  and  feel 
that  each  will  be  a credit  to  the 
organization  and  will  carry  on  its 
traditions  in  a most  worthy 
manner

Those  influence  peddlers  and 
lobbyists  in  Washington  had  bet- 
ter look  out!  There's  another 
fearless  Tennessean  on  the  way 
there  to  look  into  things.  He  is 
Lynn  Greer,  M.B.A.  freshman, 
who  left  for  the  Capitol  February 
28th  to  serve  as  a Senate  page. 
Greer’s  teachers  will  assign  his 
lessons  for  the  time  of  his  leave 
and  he  will  be  tutored  by  special 
teachers  for  page  boys.  We  know 
Lynn  will  have  a big  time  and 
not  hurt  himself  studying.  Con- 
gratulations to  a lucky  boy. 


Assembly  Prminiins 

MBA  was  honored  in  the  past 
week  to  have  two  outstanding 
assembly  programs  in  which  the 
guest  speakers  were  Mr.  Fred  W. 
Dye  and  Rector  W.  Hamilton 
Aulenbach. 

Mr.  Dye  gave  the  student  body 
and  faculty  a very  interesting  lec- 
ture on  the  harm  and  danger  of 
narcotics,  alcohol  and  sleeping 
pills.  When  speaking  of  a certain 
drug  Mr.  Dye  would  show  the 
students  a sample  of  the  drug  in 
a capsule.  He  explained  the  effect 
each  drug  and  how  its  use  changes 
even  our  way  of  thinking  and  act- 
ing. He  warned  the  student  body 
to  be  on  the  alert  and  how  to 
recognize  peddlers  of  dope.  He 
emphasized  the  absolute  neces- 
sity of  never  trying  even  one 
marijuana  cigarette  as  many  peo- 
ple have  completely  lost  then- 
sense  of  reasoning  after  one  cig- 
"arette  and  have  committed  crimes 
as  a result.  He  stated  that  any 
person  who  smoked  as  many  as 
six  of  the  cigarettes  was  “hooked” 
and  would  almost  certainly  end 
up  taking  the  more  deadly  dopes. 
He  emphasized  the  harmful  effects 
of  alcohol  on  the  body  and  the 
danger  of  using  sleeping  pills  for 
kicks.  Either  of  these  would  have 
very  harmful  effects  on  the  body 
and  if  used  to  excess  would  result 
in  early  death. 

The  Reverend  Mr.  Aulenbach. 
a Rector  from  Philadelphia  here 
to  conduct  Lenten  services,  gave 


Filling  a long-felt  need,  the 
Board  of  Trustees  of  Montgomery 
Bell  Academy  has  taken  steps 
that  will  assure  this  school  one 
of  Ihe  best,  if  not  the  very  best, 
gymnasiums  of  any  high  school  in 
Nashville.  Plans  have  developed 
to  the  place  that  the  breaking  of 
ground  for  the  project  seems  as- 
sured within  the  next  two  or 
three  months.  It  is  expected  that 
the  building  will  be  completed  in 
time  for  basketball  season  next 
year. 

The  idea  was  born  in  the  minds 
of  members  of  the  Father’s  Club 
about  three  years  ago  when  Rus- 
sell Brothers,  Sr.,  Stirton  Oman, 
Dr.  Thomas  Frist  and  others  got 
together  and  presented  the  idea 
to  the  Board  Chairman,  Mr.  John 


MISS  THOMPSON 
IN  HOSPITAL 

Miss  Loreen  Thompson,  beloved 
teacher  of  our  eighth  grade,  is 
recuperating  in  the  Baptist  Hos- 
pital after  undergoing  an  emer- 
gency operation  recently.  It  is 
expected  that  she  will  be  able  to 
return  to  her  classes  in  a few 
weeks.  While  Miss  Thompson  is 
away  her  classes  are  being  taught 
by  Mrs.  E.  P.  Horn,  mother  of 
Francis  Horn,  a former  student 
at  M.B.A. 

Miss  Thompson  has  been  with 
the  school  more  than  twelve  years 
and  is  considered  one  of  the  most 
capable  instructors  at  the  acad- 
emy. The  whole  student  body  is 
united  in  the  hope  and  prayer 
that  Miss  Thompson's  recovery 
may  be  speedy  and  that  she  will 
soon  be  filling  her  regular  place 
at  M.B.A. 


Why? 

Two  men  stood  on  a street  corner. 

Watching  the  world  go  by. 
One  gave  a coin  to  a half-starved 
tramp. 

The  other  inquired  of  him, 
“Why?" 

He  said  only  this  in  a simple 
reply. 

"‘Cept  for  God.  I’d  be  him. 
That  was  why.” 


an  inspiring  talk  on  the  ways  of 
becoming  someone  worthwhile  in 
life.  He  stated  that  as  we  follow 
a certain  line  of  athletics  we  en- 
deavor to  train  to  be  in  the  best 
possible  condition  to  do  our  best 
in  the  game.  He  said  the  same 
enthusiasm  should  be  shown  in 
everything  we  do  in  school  and 
in  activities  that  affect  our  life. 
He  stated  that  dressing  correctly 
and  holding  one’s  self  erect  had  a 
good  effect  on  one’s  thinking  and 
habits.  After  the  talk  Mr.  Aulen- 
bach gave  each  boy  a copy  of  a 
poem  written  by  himself  which

Sloan.  Mr.  Sloan  did  not  feel  at 
that  time  that  the  time  was  ripe 
for  such  a movement  but  as  the 
condition  of  the  school  improved 
and  interest  in  it  increased  he 
Uave  the  go-ahead  sign  and  threw 
himself  whole-heartedly  into  the 
effort.  Trips  were  made  to  other 
schools  including  Westminister 
School  in  Atlanta,  and  noting  that 
citizens  of  Atlanta  raised  approxi- 
mately two  and  a half  million 
dollars  to  assure  the  future  of  this 
school,  it  war  felt  that  certainly 
Nashville  would  back  a campaign 
for  the  improvement  of  Nash- 
ville’s only  private  school  for 
boys.  Through  the  efforts  of  Mr. 
Sloan  and  the  Board  of  Trustees, 
as  well  as  that  of  Mr.  Brothers, 
Mr.  Oman,  Dr.  Frist  and  other 
members  of  the  Father's  Club, 
about  $100,000  was  raised  in 
pledges  before  they  presented  the 
idea  to  the  Father’s  Club  as  a 
whole  and  launched  an  extensive 
campaign.  In  a meeting  held  Mon- 
day night,  February  27th,  Presi- 
dent Bill  Morehead,  Chairman 
Sloan  and  Co-Chairmen  Frist  and 
Brothers  presented  the  idea  to 
the  group  as  a whole.  The  re- 
sponse was  tremendous  as  every 
member  of  the  club  fell  right  into 
line  and  pledged  their  help  in 
raising  the  amount  to  assure  not 
only  the  building  of  the  gym- 
nasium but  also  various  improve- 
ments needed  to  increase  the  ca- 
pacity of  the  school  to  suit  the 
needs  of  the  demands  now  made 
upon  it  for  additional  enrollment. 
The  overall  plans  include  the  re- 
conversion of  the  old  gym  into 
six  class  rooms  and  a much- 
needed  auditorium,  the  remodel- 
ing of  the  science  building  to  in- 
crease the  capacity  of  the  science 
laboratories,  the  addition  of  four 
class  rooms  in  the  old  auditorium 
on  the  top  floor  of  the  science 
building,  and  the  reconversion  of 
some  classrooms  on  the  main  floor 
of  the  administration  building  to 
provide  adequate  room  for  ad- 
ministrative offices  and  vaults. 
The  gym  program  will  have  a 
maximum-size  playing  floor  and 
large  lower  floor  quarters  for 
dressing  rooms  and  storage. 

Representatives  of  the  archi- 
tectural firm  employed  to  draw 
the  plans  presented  preliminary 
drawings  of  the  new  construction 
and  the  remodeling  planned  for 
the  other  buildings.  Plans  for  the 
new  gym  call  for  a modem  build- 
ing in  keeping  with  the  present 
architectural  pattern  of  the  other 
buildings  on  the  campus.  The 
cost  of  this  build1  ng  is  expected  to 
be  about  $200,000.  The  other  re- 
conversions and  improvements 
would  run  the  total  expenditure 
to  near  $300,000.  It  is  the  hope, 
and  belief,  of  those  undertaking 
the  project  that  sufficient  money 
can  be  raised  to  complete  the 
entire  program. 

It  seems  a certainty  that  the

Ward  left  for  Florida  but  just 
had  to  come  back.  While  he  was 
loafing  he  found  a cocoa  “NUT”

There’s  a hot  race  going  on  in

Novak  has  been  handing  them  out

prizes  the  first  two  weeks  of  Feb- 
ruary than  any  other  week  of 
school.  Cheek  has  a knack  of  get- 
ting the  greatest  number.  No- 
body’s jealous  but  Renegar 
Horselaughs  are  getting  the  big- 
gest payoff’s.  Cochrane  has  re- 
ceived his  five  and  Ward  is  wait- 
ing for  his  chance  to  get  ten, 

Renegar  wins  blue  ribbon  for 
his  modern  art.  He  uses  Dickin-

Greasy  Pig  starts  a thriving 
business  selling  "balls  of  fire".  He

a dime.  If  you  see  a seventh  or 
eighth  grader  with  his  tongue

TENNIS  COURT  TO  BE 

(Continued  from  Page  1) 

Maroons  will  be  seeking  their 
twelfth  consecutive  city  cham- 
pionship this  year.  In  the  past 
eleven  seasons  M.B.A.  tennis  clubs 
have  marched  through  all  opposi- 
tion without  the  loss  of  a match. 
Eight  lettermen  return  this  year 
and,  despite  the  loss  of  the  top 
three  men  from  last  year's  team, 
the  boys  are  expected  to  give  a 
good  account  of  themselves.  Re- 
turning lettermen  are  Tommy 
Frist,  Gray  Smith.  Wylie  Me- 
Dougall,  Brad  Reed.  Ed  Creagh. 
Dick  Sobol,  Jimmy  Rule.  Runcie 
Clements  and  Jimmy  Kellam. 
Freshman  Eddie  Murrey  is  ex- 
pected to  win  a high  spot  on  the 
team.

has  been  widely  circulated.  This 

inspiring  poem  follows; 

"THE  GUY  IN  THE  GLASS" 

When  you  get  what  you  want  in 
your  struggle  for  pelf. 

And  the  world  makes  you  King 
for  a day. 

Then  go  to  a mirror  and  look  at 
yourself. 

And  see  what  that  guy  has  to 
say. 

For  it  isn’t  your  Father,  or  Moth- 
er. or  Wife. 

Who  judgment  upon  you  must 
pass. 

The  feller  whose  verdict  counts 
most  in  your  life 
Is  the  guy  r taring  back  from 
the  glass. 

He’s  the  feller  to  please,  never 
mind  all  the  rest. 

For  he's  with  you  clear  up  to 
the  end, 

And  you’ve  passed  your  most 
dangerous,  difficult  test. 

If  the  guy  in  the  glass  is  your 
friend. 

You  may  be  like  Jack  Horner  and 
“chisel"  a plum. 

And  think  you’re  a wonderful 
guy. 

But  the  man  in  the  glass  says 
you’re  only  a bum. 

If  you  can’t  look  him  straight 
in  the  eye. 

You  can  fool  the  whole  world 
down  the  pathway  of  years, 
And  get  pats  on  the  back  as  you 
pass, 

But  your  final  reward  will  be 
heartaches  and  tears, 

If  you’ve  cheated  the  guy  in  the 
glass. 


Deacons 

Dissertations 

R.  A.  L.  Ill 

I’m  glad  to  have  the  chance  to 
talk  to  you  again.  Even  though 
my  last  conversation  appeared 
somewhat  late  for  its  subject  mat- 
ter, I hope  you  all  had  a chance 
to  read  and  to  comprehend  what 
I said.  I must  continue  on  that 
same  theme  in  this  issue  as  sev- 
eral things  have  brought  to  my 
mind  the  subject  of  comparison 
and  distortion. 

We  have  been  hearing  a lot 
lately  about  our  Southern  Her- 
itage and  Southern  Way.  But  I’m 
beginning  to  wonder  if  there  isn't 
a danger  in  talking  too  much  and 
thinking  too  little.  We  are  not 
getting  things  straight,  it  seems 
to  me,  as  to  just  what  our  Sowtli- 
em  Heritage  is.  Therefore  let’s 
define  what  we  are  talking  about. 
The  first  word,  Southern,  is  easy 
enough;  it  is  an  adjective  that 
shows  the  word  Heritage  to  ba 
something  peculiar  to  that  tradi- 
tion-filled part  of  our  country  that 
lies  south  of  the  Ohio  River  and 
the  Mason-Dixon  Line.  The  sec- 
ond word,  Heritage,  is  just  as  easy 
as  it  denotes  something  of  value 
that  has  been  handed  down  from 
past  generations.  Although  these 
two  words  are  easily  defined 
alone,  together  they  stand  for  a 
complex  and  beautiful  thing  that 
is  not  so  easily  explained.  The 
Southern  Heritage  is  a thing  that 
is  more  easily  felt  than  explained. 
It  is  the  spirit  that  produced  men 
of  honor  and  fame  such  as  Robert 
E.  Lee  and  Cordell  Hull,  It  is  the 
ideal  that  Sam  Davis  died  for.  It 
is  the  system  that  has  bred  a land 
of  gentlemen  in  all  classes  of 
wealth.  The  Southern  Heritage  is 
an  emotion,  a system,  and  an 
ideal,  all  governed  by  a basic  set 
of  standards  or  morals. 

Nevertheless,  we  may  some- 
times inadvertantly  distort  the 
application  of  these  standards.  We 
ere  inclined  to  forget  the  values 
of  what  we  call  “Southern  Life”: 
and  we  obscure  these  values  be- 
hind a forest  of  “ism"  and  mun- 
dane causes.  When  we  speak  of 
Southern  Heritage  we  must  al- 
ways remember  that  the  most  im- 
portant part  of  a heritage  is  not 
the  privileges  it  bestows,  but  the 
duties  it  demands.  Those  duties 
of  the  Southern  gentlemen  all 
call  to  us  as  much  as  the  privi- 
leges of  life  sing  to  us. 

As  the  Southerner  (and  we  all 
may  proudly  state  that  we  are 
such)  lives  and  works  in  his  so- 
ciety, he  must  remember  that  to 
preserve  this  life  he  must  uphold 
those  principles  on  which  his  life 
is  based.  What  are  these  princi- 
ples? Need  they  bear  repeating? 
They  are  the  same  principles,  the 
same  duties,  for  which  our  an- 
cestors fought,  pleaded,  lived,  and 
died.  They  are  these  elements: 
decency,  charity,  honor,  and  truth. 


Warren  Davis  Makes 
Outstanding  Grades 

Warren  Wendell  Davis  of  At- 
lanta was  one  of  36  men  students 
in  the  Freshman  class  at  Vander- 
bilt University  who  made  an 
average  of  over  2.5  in  the  Fall 
term.  He  is  eligible  to  be  a mem- 
ber of  Phi  Eta  Sigma  Scholastic 
Society.  He  is  the  son  of  Mr.  and 
Mrs.  Warren  Young  Davis  of  3970 
Ivy  Road.  N.E.  and  attended 
Montgomery  Bell  Academy  in 
Nashville. 

Out  of  a beginning  class  of  741 
in  the  University  there  were 
fifty-three  men  and  women  with 
an  average  of  2.5  or  better.  A stu- 
dent who  earns  a grade  of  “A" 
in  all  his  courses  is  scored  3.00.

MBA — NORTH 

The  Maroons  finally  ground  out 
their  sixth  win  in  the  N.LL.  by 
beating  the  North  Yankees,  48-36. 

The  Maroons  held  a slim  lead 
throughout  the  first  and  second 
quarters.  It  was  a touch-and-go 
fight  with  the  half  ending  18-17 
in  the  Maroons  favor.  The  Ma- 
roons were  seriously  hurt  by  be- 
ing minus  the  services  of  big 
Henry  Hurt  who  had  suffered 
an  ankle  injury  in  a previous 
game.  Aside  from  his  scoring  abil- 
ity, Hurt  is  one  of  the  leading 
rebounders  in  the  N.I.L. 

The  high  scorers  for  the  Yan- 
kees were  Bowers  and  Russell. 
Leading  for  the  Maroons  were 
Phil  Williams.  Mack  Rolfe,  and 
Whit  Watson.  Tommy  Frist  played 
his  usual  fine  game.  Much  credit 
is  also  due  Jodie  Wallace  who  is 
currently  filling  in  for  Hurt.

Vanderbilt  University’s  fine

superb  shooting  ability  and  su- 
perior height  to  down  the  Ma- 
roons of  Montgomery  Bell  Acad- 
emy 70  to  36  in  the  victor’s  gym 
preceding  the  Vanderbilt-Ole  Miss 
tilt.  The  Maroons  managed  to  stay 
close  to  the  Baby  Commodores 
until  the  last  40  seconds  of  the 
first  quarter.  Until  then  the  score 
had  been  tied  12-12,  but  the  col- 
legians combined  free  throws  with 
fast  breaks  to  pull  out  to  a 19 
to  12  lead  at  the  end  of  the  first 
quarter.  By  halftime  the  boys  of 
Vanderbilt  had  extended  their 
lead  to  36  to  16,  as  they  held  the 
Maroons  without  a field  goal  in 
the  second  quarter.  At  the  end  of 
the  third  quarter  it  was  54  to  28 
with  the  frosrt  team's  superior 
height  playing  a major  role.  Mack 
Rolfe  and  Tom  Frist  topped  the 
MBA  scoring  with  eight  points 
each,  while  Hub  Houghland  and 
Jim  Henry  led  the  Baby  Commo- 
dores to  their  sixth  straight  win 
with  19  points  each.

On  Friday  night  of  the  10th 
the  Big  Red  zoomed  their  score 
up  to  one  of  the  biggest  in  his- 
tory, coming  through  with  a ram- 
paging score  of  84  to  crush  the 
David  Lipscomb  Mustangs  84-49. 
This  was  the  Big  Red’s  12th  vic- 
tory of  14  starts  in  the  NIL  race 
and  keeps  them  tied  with  Isaac 
Litton  for  the  NIL  lead. 

The  five  starters  all  made  dou- 
ble figures  with  Whit  Watson  and 
Mack  Rolfe  leading  the  pace  with 
18  and  17  points  respectively.  The 
Maroons  were  leading  16  to  13  at 
the  end  of  the  first  period  and 
from  there  zoomed  on  to  their 
high  score.  Lipscomb  was  never 
in  the  ball  game  after  that.  The 
Lipscomb  high  scorer  was  Pren- 
tice Meador  with  16  points,  12  of 
these  coming  from  foul  shots. 

This  win  kept  the  Maroon  hopes 
bright  for  winning  the  NIL.  Whit 
Watson  one  of  the  Big  Red’s  top 
men  is  among  the  scoring  leaders 
in  the  NIL.  He  holds  down  num- 
ber seven  spot  and  is  averaging 
14.2  points  per  game.

As  we  go  to  press  the  M.B.A. 
Maroons  headed  into  the  regional 
basketball  tournament  after  go- 
ing to  the  finals  of  the  district 
before  falling  to  a sharp  West 
team  that  it  had  defeated  twice 
in  the  regular  season. 

In  the  first  round  of  the  re- 
gional the  Big  Red  is  scheduled 
to  meet  the  high  flying  team  from 
Waverly  High  School.  The  sports 
writers  are  picking  the  Waverly 
club  as  a possible  champ  in  the 
regional  so  it  looks  as  though  the 
locals  will  have  their  hands  full 
when  they  square  off  against  this 
club  at  6:30  Thursday. 

The  Maroons  reached  the  finals 
by  subduing  a fighting  Hume- 
Fogg  five  in  the  first  round 
Wednesday  night.  On  their  sec- 
ond round  they  met  the  Howard 
Rebels  and  played  one  of  their 
finest  games  of  the  tournament  to 
subdue  the  South  Nashville  club 
by  the  score  of  64-44.  The  club 
looked  sharp  in  this  game  as  both 
Watson  and  Frist  hit  for  20  points 
and  the  other  members  of  the 
club  chipped  in  their  part  and

M.B.A.  Boats 

M.B.A. ’s  Maroons  gave  every 
indication  that  they  were  a team 
to  be  reckoned  with  as  they  up- 
set the  Panthers  of  Father  Ryan 
High  School  46-39  on  the  loser’s 
court 

Although  playing  without  the 
services  of  Henry  Hurt  who  was 
out  with  an  injured  ankle,  re- 
serve Jodie  Wallace  came  through 
magnificently  while  Mack  Rolfe 
did  a superb  job  on  NIL  leading 
scorer  Louie  Graham  of  Ryan  to 
give  the  Maroons  a Convincing 
win. 

Graham,  who  made  30  points 
in  a pre-Christmas  triumph  over 
M.B.A.,  didn’t  get  a single  field 
goal  for  twenty-six  minutes  as 
Rolfe,  playing  man-to-man  while 
the  other  Maroons  played  a zone, 
completely  blanketed  him.  Gra- 
ham, however,  did  connect  on 
nine  for  nine  free  throws  and 
finished  the  night  with  thirteen 
points. 

While  Rolfe,  Wallace,  Phil  Wil- 
liams, and  Tommy  Frist  had  a 
tremendous  part  in  the  victory, 
the  real  sparkplug  was  forward 
Whit  Watson,  who  was  honored 
as  “Player  of  the  Week”. 

Held  scoreless  the  first  half. 
Watson,  nevertheless,  grabbed 
eleven  rebounds  and  then  ex- 
ploded for  fifteen  points  the  last 
half,  eleven  the  last  quarter,  and 
shouldered  the  M.B.A.  attack 
down  the  stretch  almost  single- 
handedly. 

Despite  this  loss  the  Panthers 
backed  into  the  city  champion- 
ship when  both  Litton  and  M.B.A. 
lost  their  last  games  of  the  sea- 
son. 


did  some  outstanding  rebounding. 
In  the  finals  Saturday  it  just 
seemed  to  be  West’s  night  as  the 
West  End  club  hit  a remarkably 
high  percentage  of  their  shots 
from  the  floor  and  were  deadly 
from  the  foul  line.  After  M.B.A. 
had  jumped  into  a quick  lead  the 
Blues  came  back  to  tie  the  count 
and  forge  into  a lead  they  never 
relinquished.  The  final  score  of 
63-37  was  the  worst  defeat  ever 
handed  one  of  Tommy  Owen’s 
teams.  Watson,  who  had  rung  up 
45  points  in  the  first  two  games 
was  held  to  four  points  by  West. 
However  the  Maroon  forward  still 
finished  as  the  leading  scorer  in 
the  tournament  and  was  picked 
on  the  all-tournament  team.  Frist 
was  the  third  high  scorer.  Wil- 
liams was  the  top  rebounder  for 
the  Maroons  and  was  second  in 
the  tournament  in  this  depart- 
ment. Watson  and  Hurt  also 
placed  high  in  this  department. 

Should  the  Maroons  win  their 
first  round  with  the  tough  Wa- 
verly club  they  will  meet  Hills- 
boro Friday  night  and  would 
have  to  win  both  of  these  to  get 
a shot  in  the  select  State  finals 
at  Vanderbilt  next  week.

It  was  a wise  man  who  said 
“Of  all  sad  words  of  tongue  or 
pen,  the  saddest  are  these:  ‘It 
might  have  been’  ’’.  That  quote  is 
especially  applicable  to  the  Big 
Red  basketball  team  which  was 
so  near,  yet  so  far,  from  another 
championship  for  the  school.  In 
fact  there  is  just  a little  matter 
of  five  seconds  that  knocked  the 
Maroons  from  first  place  to  a 
fourth  place  finish. 

Playing  at  T.P.S.  on  Saturday 
night,  February  18th,  the  Maroons 
were  a heavy  favorite  to  win  their 
last  game  of  the  season.  What  is 
more,  they  held  a two  point  lead 
with  just  five  seconds  of  the  game 
remaining  when  big  Apple  of 
T.P.S.  tossed  in  a desperation  shot 
that  sent  the  game  into  the  over- 
time period.  In  this  extra  period 
the  T.P.S.  club  scored  three  points 
to  two  for  the  Maroons  and  that 
was  the  ball  game.  At  that  time 
it  looked  as  though  it  would  not 
greatly  matter  as  Litton  defeated 
Central  to  keep  up  its  pace  at  the 
head  of  the  league.  But  few  could 
foresee  that  Litton  might  drop 
its  final  game  of  the  season.  Yet 
that  is  just  what  happened  and 
the  M.B.A,  loss  to  T.P.S.  was  the 
only  thing  that  kept  them  from 
having  a clear  claim  to  the  cham- 
pionship. As  it  was  Ryan  backed 
into  the  championship  by  virtue 
of  having  played  more  games 
than  three  other  clubs  who  had 
the  number  of  losses  as  the  Pan- 
thers. 

In  the  closest  finish  in  years,  the 
four  top  teams  of  the  league,  in- 
cluding Ryan,  Litton.  Hillsboro 
and  M.B.A.  each  had  three  losses 
but  they  were  ranked  at  the  finish 
in  the  order  named  due  to  some 
clubs  playing  more  games  than 
others  and  thus  enjoying  a higher 
percentage  of  wins. 

Anyway,  it  was  fine  season  and 
each  of  these  clubs  will  be  bat- 
tling it  out  to  come  through  their 
district  and  regional  meets  in 
order  to  redeem  themselv  s.  AH

On  Tuesday.  January  31,  the 
Nashville  Banner  honored  the 
champions  of  Davidson  County 
and  Middle  Tennessee  at  the 
twelfth  annual  Banquet  of  Cham- 
pions at  the  Maxwell  House  Hotel. 

The  highlight  of  the  evening 
was  a speech  by  former  Notre 
Dame  football  coach  Frank  Leahy. 
Mr.  Leahy  described  the  five 
qualities  he  says  all  champions 
need  to  remain  on  top. 

He  listed  them  as  spelling  out 
the  word  CHAMP,  with  C for 
confidence,  H for  habit  (good 
habit  formation),  A for  attitude. 
M for  myself  (improving  from 
day  to  day  as  a person,  moving 
toward  championship  calibre), 
and  P for  persistence. 

It  was  an  unprecedented  eve- 
ning not  matched  at  any  other 
Banner  banquet,  a rousing  suc- 
cess from  the  start  as  stimulating 
oratory  was  mixed  with  humor 
and  music. 

And  all  the  while,  as  thrill  fol- 
lowed thrill  and  champion  fol- 
lowed champion,  the  long-estab- 
lished Banner  trophies  were  being 

carried  off by  Johnny  Majors 

of  Tennessee,  Art  Guepc  of  Van- 
derbilt. Joe  Bates  of  Ryan,  by 
MBA’s  state  football  champs,  by 
the  NIL’s  league  winners.  Capt. 
Frank  Burkholder  accepted  the 
huge  state  championship  plaque 
for  M.B.A. 

All  who  attended  the  banquet, 
school  principals,  coaches,  and 
athletes,  heartily  agreed  that  this 
was  an  occasion  never  to  be  for- 
gotten. The  Nashville  Banner  is 
to  be  congratulated  for  this  fine 
effort  in  the  interest  of  sports.

four  years  if  he  plays  this  year. 
Whit  has  made  ALL  18th  DIS- 
TRICT twice  in  basketball  and  his 
name  is  no  new-comer  to  the  all- 
city checklists  either.  He  has  also

naments to  round  out  his  out- 
standing career  at  M.B.A.  Whit

tion.

MAROONS 

Montgomery  Bell  Academy’s 
red-hot  Maroons  zoomed  into  the 
Nashville  Interscholastic  League 
lead  by  thumping  West  High 
46-42  on  the  losers’  court. 

Both  teams  made  numerous 
floor  mistakes  in  the  rough  and 
tumble  defensive  battle.  However, 
Coach  Tommy  Owen's  Maroons 
overcame  their  errors  with  deadly 
shooting  from  the  field  to  post 
their  eleventh  victory  against 
only  two  losses. 

M.B.A  hit  for  an  amazing  45.2 
shooting  percentage  by  connect- 
ing on  19  of  42  cracks  at  the 
basket. 

The  lead  changed  hands  eleven 
times  during  the  battle.  After  a 
see-saw  battle  for  three  minutes, 
the  Blue  Jays  of  West  took  com- 


TniJ  WEST 

mand  and  held  the  advantage 
until  the  last  thirty  seconds  of 
the  first  half  when  M.B.A.  went 
ahead  at  intermission  24-23. 

It  was  the  same  see-saw  story 
in  the  third  quarter,  but  again 
the  Maroons  were  out  in  front  at 
the  rest  stop  34-32.  The  Maroons 
pulled  out  in  the  final  period  as 
they  stalled  the  ball  and  drew  nu- 
merous fouls  from  the  frantic 
Blue  Jays. 

Maroon  fans  were  relieved  by 
the  appearance  of  Henry  Hurt  in 
the  game.  It  was  Hurt’s  first  game 
in  several  weeks.  He  has  been  out 
with  an  ankle  injury.  Whit  Wat- 
son and  Tom  Frist  were  the  big 
offensive  guns  for  M.B.A.  as  they 
ripped  the  nets  for  15  and  12 
points  respectively.  • 


\Iichael  Larsrn 

This  month  the  Bell  Ringer  is 
proud  to  have  as  its  “Girl  of  the 
Month".  Miss  Michael  Larsen. 


with  favor  upon  this  undertaking 
as  Montgomery  Bell  Academy  has 
played  a very  important  part  in 
the  history  of  this  city.  With  an 
unbroken  line  of  Trustees  going 
back  to  Davidson  Academy  which 
was  established  in  1785,  before 
Tennessee  became  a state,  and 
soon  after  the  founding  of  the 
city.  Through  good  and  lean  years 
the  institution  contributed  greatly 
to  the  cultural  life  of  the  city. 
Through  the  various  changes  in 
names  from  Davidson  Academy, 
Cumberland  College,  Western 
Military  Institute,  and  the  Uni- 
versity of  Nashville,  there 
emerged  the  school  under  its 
present  name  after  Montgomery 
Bell,  a Nashville  Philanthropist, 
left  an  amount  to  endow  the 
school  destined  to  bear  his  name.

have  increased  tremendously  in 
the  past  few  years  and  due  tn 
conditions  now  arising  it  is  ex- 
pected that  the  school  will  be 
flooded  with  applications  for 
years  to  come.  For  instance,  at 
the  present  time  there  are  already 
on  file  for  the  fall  term  of  1957, 
more  than  a year  away,  more 
than  30  applications  for  entrance 
to  the  seventh  grade  alone. 
Normally  the  school  accepts  only 
twenty  boys  in  the  seventh  grade 
but  that  number  is  already  ex- 
ceeded for  not  only  the  1957-58 
term  but  also  for  that  of  the  fol- 
lowing year.  It  is  therefore  the 
plan  of  the  Board  of  Trustees  to 
provide  for  increased  demand  for 
entrance  to  the  school  by  pro- 
viding facilities  to  permit  an  en- 
rolment of  300  boys  instead  of  the 
present  capacity  of  230. 

While  Mr.  Sloan.  Dr.  Sager, 
and  other  interested  members 
made  it  plain  that  the  primary 
aim  was  to  maintain  and  even 
increase  the  high  scholarship  of 
the  school  that  has  placed  it 
among  the  top  preparatory  schools 
in  the  South,  they  are  also  glad 
to  be  able  to  provide  present 
and  future  students  with  physical 
education  facilities  second  to 
none  in  the  city. 

The  boys  of  the  school  are 
elated  over  these  developments 
and  it  seems  certain  that  the 
realization  of  these  dreams  will 
do  much  to  increase  their  pride 
in  the  institution.  Students  and 
alumni  have  long  demonstrated 
a spirit  that  is  the  envy  of  many 
other  institutions  but  with  these 
new  plans  under  way  it  is  ex- 
pected that  their  enthusiasm  will 
reach  a new  high.  Certainly  a 
school  that  has  ranked  so  high 
both  in  scholastic  training  and  in 
top-flight  athletic  teams  in  the 
past  can  but  look  to  the  future 
with  great  hope  and  pride.  Even 
with  the  enrollment  limited  to 
300  boys  the  school  is  expected 
soon  to  be  able  to  select  only  the 
boys  who  show  promise  of  fitting 
into  the  over-all  program  of  the 
institution. 

A new  day  has  dawned  for 
M.B.A.  and  every  citizen  of  Nash- 
ville will  take  pride  in  this  new 
promise.  Hail  Montgomery  Bell! 
Go  Big  Red!
