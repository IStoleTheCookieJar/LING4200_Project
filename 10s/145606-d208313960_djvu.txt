As  used  herein,  "River  Trails"  includes  the  area  bordered  by  the  following: 

North:  by  Trinity  Boulevard; 
East:     Precinct  Line  Road 
South:    by  Saranac  Trail

Lessee  shall  hire  an  independent  surveyor  to  conduct  the  survey,  and  shall  pay  all  expenses  associated  with 
the  survey.  Attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  "B"  is  a  map  of  the  area  comprising  "River  Trails"  as  defined 
herein. 

For  the  same  consideration  stated  above,  Lessor  agrees  and  does  hereby  communitize  their  mineral  interest 
in  the  "River  Trails"  Subdivision  with  all  other  mineral  owners  in  the  "River  Trails"  Subdivision  entering 
into  a  Carrizo  lease  which  contains  a  similar  communitization  provision.  Such  communitization  shall  be 
based  upon  a  fraction  with  a  numerator  reflecting  the  amount  of  net  mineral  acres  contributed  by  each 
respective  communitizing  Lessor  and  a  numerator  reflecting  the  total  number  of  acres  covered  by  the 
"River  Trails"  Subdivision  which  for  the  purposes  of  this  provision  shall  be  deemed  to  contain  297  acres  of 
land,  more  or  less.  It  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed,  in  the  event  all  or  part  of  the  Lease  is  released 
and/or  the  Lease  fully  or  partially  expires,  that  each  respective  communitizing  Lessor  shall  own  then- 
respective  and  separate  mineral  interest,  which  is  so  released  or  which  expires,  in  the  same  manner  and/or 
proportion  as  immediately  prior  to  the  date  of  execution  of  this  lease  as  fully  as  though  this  lease  had  never 
been  executed.  Pooling  all  or  part  of  River  Trails  Subdivision  shall  perpetuate  the  mineral  interest  covered 
by  this  lease  pursuant  to  the  pooling  provision  contained  herein.  Any  non  released  anaVor  non  expiring 
mineral  interest  cover  by  this  lease  shall  continue  to  be  administered  as  a  communitized  mineral  interest 
under  this  provision.  .
