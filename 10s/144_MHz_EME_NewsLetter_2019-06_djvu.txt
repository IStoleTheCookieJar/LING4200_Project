VP2EMB QRV from Anguilla (FK88MG) 

You can almost count on Chris PA2CHR and Jos PA3FYC to activate a very much wanted DXCC on 2 
m EME and up nearly every year. After TD9 last year and E44 in 2016 they had chosen VP2E Anguilla 
for their 2019 activity. From April 12" to 21%t they wanted to become QRV on even three bands, 
2 m, 70 cm and 23 cm. Their 2 m station was basically the same as the one from last year’s 
Guatemala activity: FT857, some 800 watts out from a SSPA and 2 x 20 ele xpol yagis (10 elements 
in each plane) with some 26 dBd in either plane. Of course a Ina at the splitter arranged for a decent 
noise figure of the system.

Chris and Jos with the complete dxpedition gear...again some 180 kg | 


After a nine hours flight from Amsterdam Chris and Jos arrived at Princess Juliana Airport (this is the 
one where also the big planes fly only some 20 m above the local beach when landing) in St. Maarten 
(PJ7) on April 10°. To make sure all the luggage arrives on time they stayed for one night on St. 
Maarten. Last year’s experience from Guatemala where parts were missing and delivered one day 
later had made them cautious. As the transfer from St. Maarten to Anguilla was by ferry it would 
have meant a big problem if parts of baggage had been missing and would be delivered to them 
later. Luckily this time everything was complete which meant a good start to the DXpedition. 


So on the 11° in 30 minutes they ferry took them and their 180 kg to Anguilla Island. As the ferry 
was too small for cars Chris and Jos had to take all the luggage by hand on and off the ferry: 7 
suitcases and 2 golf bags. After arrival at Anguilla they arranged a taxi, went to the government to 
pick up the radio licence first and then to a supermarket to get food etc. for coming days. After these 
preparations the taxi brought them to their location in the North-east part of the island. 


Right upon arrival they assembled one antenna for 2 m and used this with a portable SSB receiver 
to find out if there was any QRM around. Indeed some QRM was received from the neighbour’s 
house but they found a good location for the antennas. After a few hours work the antenna system 
for 2 m was complete and only the transceivers and other equipment inside the temporary shack in 
the living room needed to be connected.

At home Jos and Chris had modified their power supplies for PA's and transceivers to run on 110 
Volts AC - and all worked fine: First signals on 2 m were copied on the April 12° at 0037 UTC. From

then until moonset about 15 stations from USA and Japan were worked. Due to a small hill and some 
trees at moonrise some 12 degrees minimum elevation were needed, so the huge European pile up 
started only at 1645 UTC on the 12". During this moon pass 85 QSO's were completed. 


The next day 2m conditions were not so good anymore, maybe due to solar activity. More 
importantly after some hours noise-flares were noticed. Because of that noise the team decided to 
move the antenna system to a position with more distance from the neighbour’s house. Sadly, that 
was without success — the QRM became even stronger, up to 8 to 10 dB. Further investigation with 
the portable receiver during the night and the next day got them closer to the reason: The noise 
was coming ‘out off the walls of the house’. Maybe PLC internet? The last possibility was moving 
the complete antenna to the front of the house for the last few moon passes, almost on the main 
road. They had to use all the spare coax to do this, about 30 m but at least had a much better 
moonrise now, good to be able to work the smaller stations in Europe. Only, as soon as it got dark 
the noise again increased up to 10 dB. Now it was easy to find the source: 2 security camera's with 
infrared led’s were looking straight into the antenna! 


Luckily the owner of the house, living on the first floor, was so kind to switch off these cameras for 
the rest of the stay. So the last moon passes the reception was very good and many small stations 
could be worked on 2 m, such as RV3IG and OK1TEH who both run with 1 yagi only. At the end of 
the DXpedition a total of 262 QSO's were in the 2 m log, after seven moon passes. On 70 cm 39 
QSO's were completed with the new homemade 27 ele hor/ 23 ele vpol xpol and 300 W at the feed. 
The smallest station worked was PASY who is using just a single 23 ele on that band. The 58 QSO's 
on 23 cm were more than expected. Here the smallest station worked was PE1LWT with a 3 m dish 
and 180 Watt.
