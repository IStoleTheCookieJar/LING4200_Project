PREFACE 


Life-cycle  assessment  (LCA)  results  can  vary  depending  on  how  the  sponsoring  group 
defines  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA  and  what  methods  and  data  are  used  to  conduct  the 
assessment.  There  are  an  increasing  number  of  organizations  using  LCA  for  a  wide  variety  of 
internal  and  external  purposes.  Conducting  an  LCA  can  be  complex,  and  may  require 
significant  data  and  information  depending  on  the  scope  and  goals  of  the  study.  For  these 
reasons  it  appears  desireable  to  develop  scientifically  based  guidelines  for  conducting  LCAs. 
Also,  it  is  useful  to  provide  technical  reports  to  help  users  understand  the  status  of  LCA, 
available  methods,  sources  of  data,  and  other  information  relevant  to  conducting  LCAs. 

The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  has  responded  by  supporting  a 
multioffice  LCA  program  to  develop  technical  information  reports  and,  in  some  cases, 
various  guidelines.  This  multioffice  program  consists  of  representatives  from  the  Office  of 
Research  and  Development  (ORD),  the  Office  of  Air  Quality  Planning  and  Standards 
(OAQPS),  the  Office  of  Solid  Waste  (OSW),  and  the  Office  of  Pollution  Prevention  and 
Toxics  (OPPT).  The  LCA  program  uses  a  consensus-building  approach,  coordinating  closely 
with  the  Society  of  Environmental  Toxicology  and  Chemistry  (SET AC).  Through  the 
organization  of  a  series  of  workshops,  SET  AC  has  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  development  of 
a  technical  framework  for  conducting  LCAs. 

The  first  in  a  series  of  EPA  LCA  methodological  guidelines  documents.  Life  Cycle 
Assessment:  Inventory  Guidelines  and  Principles,  and  Life  Cycle  Design  Manual- 
Environmental  Requirements  and  the  Product  System  were  released  in  early  1993. 
Supplementary  LCA  documents  including  Life-Cycle  Assessment:  Public  Data  Sources  for  the 
LCA  Practitioner  and  Guidelines  for  Assessing  the  Quality  of  Life-Cycle  Inventory  Data  were 
released  in  April  1995.  Ongoing  EPA  LCA  projects  include  life-cycle  inventory  case  studies 
on  residential  carpeting  systems,  shop  towels  in  industrial  laundries,  and  solvent  alternatives; 
streamlined  LCA  methodology  development;  and  product  re-design  through  LCAs. 

This  document,  which  is  a  technical  information  report,  includes  the  output  from  a  two- 
phased  research  approach  on  the  impact  assessment  component  of  LCA.  Phase  I  identified  and 
discussed  key  issues  in  the  development  of  a  conceptual  framework  for  conducting  an  impact 
assessment^  Phase  II  included  documenting  existing  methods  that  exhibit  potential  for 
application  in  impact  assessment  and  identifying  gaps  in  the  impact  assessment  methodology. 
This  document  contains  the  combined  output  of  Phases  I  and  IT

CHAPTER  1 


INTRODUCTION 

Although  a  wide  variety  of  impact  assessment  techniques  have  been  integral  to  various 
disciplines,  impact  assessment  in  the  context  of  Life-Cycle  Assessment  (LCA)  is  in  its  infancy. 
A  conceptual  framework  for  conducting  impact  assessment  has  been  established,  but  experts 
have  not  yet  reached  a  consensus  on  specific  methods  and  procedures.  This  document  outlines  a 
possible  framework,  discusses  key  issues,  and  summarizes  existing  methods  for  conducting 
impact  assessment.  This  document  is  not  a  guidance  document,  however,  but  rather  a 
compendium  on  the  state  of  practice  of  impact  assessment. 

LCA  is  a  holistic  concept  and  methodology  for  evaluating  the  environmental  and  human 
health  burdens  associated  with  a  product,  process,  or  activity.  A  complete  LCA  identifies  inputs 
and  outputs;  assesses  the  potential  impacts  of  those  inputs  and  outputs  on  ecosystems,  human 
health,  and  natural  resources;  and  identifies  opportunities  for  achieving  improvements.  The 
basic  life-cycle  stages  covered  in  LCA  include  raw  materials  acquisition,  manufacturing, 
use/reuse/maintenance,  and  recycling/waste  management.  The  LCA  approach  consists  of  four 
interrelated  components,  including  impact  assessment.  These  components  are  illustrated  in 
Figure  1-1  and  explained  below.

•  Goal  definition  and  scoping:  the  explanation  of  the  study’s  purpose  and  objectives; 
the  identification  of  the  product,  process,  or  activity  of  interest;  the  identification  of  the 
intended  end-use  study  results;  and  the  key  assumptions  and  methods  employed. 

•  Inventory  analysis:  the  identification  and  quantification  of  raw  materials  and  energy 
inputs,  air  emissions,  water  effluents,  solid  waste,  and  other  life-cycle  inputs  and 
outputs. 

•  Impact  assessment:  the  qualitative  or  quantitative  classification,  characterization,  and 
valuation  of  impacts  of  the  inventory  items  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and  natural 
resources,  based  on  the  results  of  an  inventory  analysis  and  application  of  various 
methods  and  models  to  determine  significance  of  the  inventory  items. 

•  Improvement  assessment:  the  identification  and  evaluation  of  opportunities  to 
achieve  improvements  in  products  and/or  processes  that  result  in  reduced  environ¬ 
mental  impacts,  based  on  the  results  of  an  inventory  analysis  or  impact  assessment. 

For  almost  20  years,  a  wide  variety  of  organizations  have  conducted  less-than-complete 
LCAs.  Most  of  these  LCAs  focused  on  the  inventory  analysis  component  and  stopped  short  of 
analyzing  impacts.  This  focus  has  enabled  LCA  analysts  to  concentrate  on  developing  and 
refining  procedures  for  building  credible  and  reliable  inventories  of  system  inputs  and  outputs 
and  using  these  inventories  for  identifying  possible  improvement  opportunities. 

Formal  procedures  for  conducting  impact  assessments  have  not  yet  been  established. 

The  primary  purpose  of  impact  assessment  in  LCA  is  to  assess  the  potential  impacts  resulting 
from  inputs  and  outputs  quantified  in  the  inventory  analysis.  By  providing  this  information, 
impact  assessment  can  enhance  the  basis  for  evaluating  and  justifying  the  trade-offs  among  a 
variety  of  inputs  and  outputs,  as  well  as  improvement  options.  As  existing  LCA  and  impact 
assessment  tools  are  refined  and  new  ones  developed,  practitioners  are  expected  to  include  more 
impact  assessments  as  part  of  LCAs. 

1.1  KEY  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT  TERMS  AND  CONCEPTS 

In  developing  procedures  for  impact  assessments,  an  important  step  is  establishing  a 
common  language.  Fundamental  terms  used  in  impact  assessment  are  often  the  subject  of 
confusion.  For  example,  distinguishing  between  an  inventory  item  and  an  impact  is  not  always 
easy.  Although  a  common  practice  is  to  account  for  the  amount  of  solid  waste  materials 
produced  by  a  system  in  an  inventory  analysis,  it  is  not  common  to  account  for  the  amount  of 
natural  habitat  consumed  to  dispose  of  that  solid  waste.  Some  analysts  might  consider  this 
consumption  of  natural  habitat  an  input,  while  others  might  consider  it  an  impact.  This  section 
focuses  on  key  terms  that  distinguish  between  inventory  item  and  impact  and  provides  a  working 


1-2 


definition  of  impact  assessment.  Table  1-1  defines  an  inventory  item  and  an  impact  and  lists 
examples  and  issues  related  to  each  term.  Appendix  C  provides  a  glossary  for  other  terms  and 
concepts  used  in  this  document. 

1.1.1  Inventory  Item 

An  inventory  item  is  defined  in  this  document  as  a  quantitative  measure  of  an  energy  or 
raw  material  requirement,  atmospheric  emission,  waterborne  effluent,  solid  waste,  or  other  input 
or  output  of  a  particular  product,  process,  or  activity.  In  the  past,  an  inventory  item  has  referred 
to  more  traditional  inputs  and  outputs.  For  purposes  of  impact  assessment,  however,  some  more 
nontraditional  inputs  and  outputs  (e.g.,  soil  compaction,  habitat  use)  associated  with  a  production 
system  also  may  be  appropriate  to  consider  in  the  inventory  analysis.

AND  ISSUES 


Inventory  Item 


Impact 


Definition 


A  quantitative  measure  of  an  energy  or 
raw  material  requirement,  atmospheric 
emission,  waterborne  effluent,  solid 
waste,  or  other  quantifiable  input  or 
output  of  a  particular  product,  process, 
or  activity. 


An  actual  or  potential  change  in  an 
environmental  characteristic  resulting 
from  interactions  between  the  inventory 
items,  or  components  of  a  particular 
product,  process,  or  activity  and  the 
environment. 


Examples 


Issues  Related  to

tons  of  SO2  emissions/year 

tons  of  solid  waste  per  day 

biochemical  oxygen  demand 
(BOD)  released  per  unit  of 
production 

tons  of  oil  per  unit  of  output 

Interaction  between  different 
releases  may  create  new 
substances  that  increase  or  mitigate 
effects. 

Uncertainty  of  inventory  data  can 
dramatically  affect  the  results  of 
impact  assessment. 


•  acid  precipitation 

•  ozone  depletion 

•  soil  erosion 

•  habitat  consumption 

•  increased  risk  of  cancer 

•  Uncertainty  is  associated  with  the 
existence,  nature,  and  extent  of 
impacts  in  an  uncontrolled 
environmental  setting. 

•  Multiple  impact  pathways  make 
allocating  impacts  difficult. 

•  Qualitative  items,  such  as  habitat 
consumption  and  social  welfare,  are 
difficult  to  determine  and  quantify. 


1-3 


One  issue  associated  with  inventory  items  in  the  context  of  LCA  is  that  the  composition 
of  the  inventory  is  primarily  based  on  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  study.  Because  every  input  and 
output  of  a  production  system  cannot  typically  be  included  in  the  inventory  analysis,  those 
included  and/or  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  inventory  analysis  should  be  made  transparent  to 
the  user.  In  addition,  practitioners  may  want  to  modify  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  study  to  see 
how  that  modification  affects  not  only  the  composition  of  inputs  and  outputs  captured  in  the 
inventory  analysis,  but  the  overall  LCA  as  well. 

A  second  issue  associated  with  inventory  items  is  the  synergistic  nature  of  some 
compounds.  The  synergistic  effect  of  mixed  compounds  may  increase  the  concern  about  the 
original  compound  or  create  a  new  compound(s)  that  is  not  captured  in  the  inventory.  Such 
synergistic  compounds  may  have  the  potential  to  create  combined  impacts  greater  than  those  of 
the  individual  releases.  For  example,  the  interaction  between  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  and 
particulate  matter — where  small  particles  transport  SO2  and  sometimes  sulfuric  acid  deep  into 
the  lungs — can  increase  damage  (Ott,  1987).  Synergistic  compounds  do  not  necessarily  need  to 
be  included  in  the  inventory,  but  practitioners  should  nonetheless  recognize  this  potential  effect 
and  other  factors  (e.g.,  antagonistic  effects,  assimilative  capacity)  when  drawing  conclusions 
based  on  LCA  results. 

Another  issue  is  distinguishing  between  an  inventory  item  and  an  impact.  For  instance, 
should  a  largely  qualitative  item  such  as  habitat  consumption  be  included  as  an  inventory  item  or 
should  it  be  treated  as  an  impact?  For  purposes  of  this  document  inventory  items  are  limited  to 
readily  quantifiable  “traditional”  inputs  and  outputs  (e.g.,  raw  materials  and  energy  use,  air 
emissions,  waterborne  effluent,  solid  waste).  Items  such  as  habitat  consumption  that  are  not  so 
easily  quantified  and  often  involve  value  judgments  are  treated  as  impacts.

In  the  context  of  LCA,  impact  may  be  defined  as  an  actual  or  potential  change  in  an 
environmental  characteristic  that  results  from  interactions  between  the  components  of  a  defined 
system  and  the  environment.  Impacts  relevant  to  impact  assessment  are  categorized  according  to 
whether  they  affect  ecosystems,  human  health,  and  natural  resources  (SET AC,  1993).  Although 
they  are  not  the  primary  focus  of  impact  assessment,  social  welfare  impacts  may  also  be 
considered  to  the  extent  that  they  indirectly  may  cause  impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and 
natural  resources.  Currently,  methods  for  handling  social  welfare  impacts  in  the  context  of 
impact  assessment  are  not  well  developed.

The  Stressor  Concept 

Although  not  explicitly  used  in  this  document,  the  stressor  concept  has  provided  a 
useful  means  of  talking  about  the  relationship  between  inventory  items  and  subsequent 
impacts.  A  stressor  is  defined  as  any  physical,  chemical,  or  biological  entity  that  can  induce 
an  impact,  and  may  be  characterized  by  the  following  attributes: 

•  Type:  chemical,  physical,  or  biological 

•  Intensity:  concentration,  magnitude,  abundance/density 

•  Duration:  acute  (short  term)  versus  chronic  (long  term) 

•  Frequency:  single  event  versus  recurring  or  multiple  exposures 

•  Timing:  time  of  occurrence  relative  to  environmental  and  human  health 
parameters 

•  Scale:  spatial  extent  and  heterogeneity  in  intensity  (ERA,  1992c). 

The  stressor  concept  is  imbedded  (implicitly)  in  life-cycle  impact  assessment.  In  this 
context,  a  stressor  can  be  an  inventory  item  that  leads  to  a  primary  impact(s),  or  a  stressor 
can  be  an  impact  that  leads  to  a  secondary  impact(s),  and  so  on.  For  example,  a  stressor 
could  be  identified  as  a  quantity  of  SOg  emissions  to  the  air  from  a  given  product  or  process 
system.  This  SO2  can  be  linked  to  primary  impacts  such  as  acid  precipitation.  Acid 
precipitation  is  an  impact  of  SO2  emissions  as  well  as  a  stressor,  because  it  can  be  linked  to 
secondary  impacts  such  as  acidification  of  water  bodies,  tree  damage,  building  materials 
corrosion,  and  the  leaching  of  metals  from  soils. 


Several  issues  are  related  to  the  definition  of  an  impact.  First,  impact  in  the  context  of 
impact  assessment  rarely  means  an  actual  impact  but  instead  means  a  potential  impact.  The  term 
“potential”  is  not  meant  to  minimize  concern  for  those  impacts  but  to  point  out  that  impact 
assessment  does  not  necessarily  provide  direct  measures  of  actual  impacts,  such  as  the  actual 
number  of  dead  fish  that  result  from  the  waterborne  effluent  X  of  process  A.  Instead,  impact 
assessment  might  attempt  to  establish  a  link  between  inventory  items  and  potential  impacts.  For 
example,  waterborne  effluent  X  from  process  A  may  be  identified  in  the  literature  as  toxic  to 
fish  above  a  threshold  concentration.  Researchers  can  use  this  threshold  to  indicate  the  potential 
for  impact  and  not  the  actual  number  of  fish  harmed  or  killed.  Thus,  unless  otherwise  specified, 
the  term  “impact”  in  this  report  implicitly  carries  the  connotation  of  potential  impact. 

A  second  issue  is  the  difficulty  in  quantifying  potential  impacts  (e.g.,  estimating  the 
number  of  fish  mortality  resulting  from  release  of  waterborne  effluent  X).  Limitations  in  data 


1-5 


availability,  modeling,  and  resource  limitations — and  the  complexity  of  most  natural 
systems — often  require  a  more  qualitative  description  of  impacts  based  on  some  amount  of 
quantitative  information  (e.g.,  level  of  pollutants  released).  This  issue,  however,  should  not 
discourage  practitioners  from  conducting  impact  assessments.  Depending  on  the  goals  and  scope 
of  the  LCA,  qualitative  information  may  be  adequate,  and  in  some  cases  preferred,  to  assist  users 
in  identifying  and  evaluating  opportunities  to  achieve  environmental  improvements. 

A  third  issue  associated  with  the  term  impact  is  the  potential  large  number  of  impacts 
associated  with  any  given  inventory  item.  That  is,  although  impact  assessment  attempts  to 
establish  a  link  between  inventory  items  and  impacts,  a  large  number  of  impacts  can  be 
associated  with  any  single  inventory  item.  Ideally,  impact  assessment  would  analyze  every 
potential  impact,  but  that  would  typically  be  infeasible.  Therefore,  practitioners  need  to  decide 
which  impacts  are  within  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA  and  if  those  impacts  can  be  estimated 
or  measured. 

Finally,  the  potential  for  an  impact  to  occur  is  not  easily  defined,  nor  easily  captured,  in 
any  impact  analysis.  The  analysis  is  hindered  by  a  number  of  uncertainties  and  a  general  lack  of 
knowledge  about  the  natural  processes  that  determine  the  fate,  or  impact,  of  substances  or 
activities  in  the  environment.  The  potential  for  an  impact  to  occur  is  governed  by  a  number  of 
different  variables,  such  as  those  listed  in  the  following  function: 

Impact  =  f  (location,  medium,  time,  rate  of  release,  routes  of  exposure,  natural  processes, 
persistence,  mobility,  accumulation,  toxicity,  concentration  of  release, 
assimilative  capacity,  synergism,  antagonism,  etc.) 

The  uncertainty  associated  with  an  impact  actually  occurring  is  often  the  subject  of  considerable 
debate.  Uncertainty,  in  this  context,  focuses  on  the  interrelationships  between  the  inventory 
items  and  the  associated  impacts  and  between  the  impacts  themselves. 

1.1.3  Impact  Assessment 

In  the  LCA  literature,  impact  assessment  has  different  meanings  for  different  people. 

The  following  are  a  few  examples  of  the  multiple  interpretations  of  impact  assessment  presented 
in  the  context  of  LCA: 

•  An  assessment  of  the  impacts  on  human  health  and  the  environment  associated  with 
raw  materials  and  energy  inputs  and  environmental  releases  quantified  by  the  inventory 
(Tellus  Institute,  1992a). 


1-6 


•  A  system  utilized  to  ascertain  the  elements  and  processes  involved  in  translating  impact 
indicators  into  the  response  of  environmental  receptors  and  the  associated  impacts 
incurred  by  the  receptors  and  suffered  within  the  process  of  transformation  (Canadian 
Standards  Association,  1992). 

•  A  technical,  quantitative,  and/or  qualitative  process  that  characterizes  and  assesses  the 
effects  of  environmental  loadings  as  identified  in  the  inventory  stage  of  the  LCA 
(SET  AC,  1993). 

•  A  process  that  meaningfully  relates  inventory  information  into  relevant  concerns  about 
natural  resource  usage  and  potential  effects  of  environmental  loadings,  consistent  with 
the  defined  scope,  specificity,  and  technical  precision  of  the  life-cycle  inventory  data 
(Procter  and  Gamble,  1992). 

•  An  analysis  of  the  effects  of  inputs  and  outputs  on  the  environment,  where  the  effects 
are  secondary  inventory  values  that  are  induced  to  change  as  a  result  of  the  primary 
inputs  and  outputs  of  an  industrial  system  (Scientific  Certification  System,  1992). 

An  underlying  theme  throughout  these  descriptions  is  that  impact  assessment  is  a  process 
of  linking  the  inputs  from  and  outputs  to  the  environment  (which  are  compiled  in  the  inventory) 
to  potential  impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  natural  resources,  and  possibly  social  welfare 
impacts.  For  purposes  of  this  report  we  define  impact  assessment  as  follows: 


Impact  assessment:  A  systematic  process  to  identify,  characterize,  and 
value  potential  impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and  natural 
resources  based  on  the  results  of  a  life-cycle  inventory. 


1.2  PURPOSE  OF  LIFE-CYCLE  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 

Impact  assessment  attempts  to  take  the  input  and  output  data  compiled  in  an  inventory 
analysis  and  translate  that  data  into  either  ( 1 )  a  quantitative  and/or  qualitative  description  of 
environmental  impact,  or  (2)  a  description  of  how  each  inventory  item  (per  functional  unit) 
contributes  to  environmental  impacts.  A  complete  impact  assessment  considers  potential 
impacts  to  the  full  range  of  environmental  media  (e.g.,  air,  water,  land). 

Conceivably,  LCA  could  stop  after  the  inventory  analysis.  One  reason  it  does  not  is  that 
impact  assessment  makes  explicit  the  methods  used  to  compare  and  weigh  inventory  items. 
Failing  to  communicate  these  methods  might  convey  that  all  inventory  items  have  relatively 
similar  magnitudes  of  impacts.  Another  reason  for  continuing  past  the  inventory  analysis  is  to 
provide  the  LCA  user  with  information  that  is  more  useful  for  decisionmaking.  For  example, 
determining  the  relative  overall  environmental  burden  associated  with  two  product  systems  is 


1-7 


often  difficult  when  the  emissions  of  one  pollutant,  say  SO2,  are  estimated  to  be  higher  for  one 
production  system,  while  emissions  of  a  different  pollutant,  say  reactive  hydrocarbons,  are 
estimated  to  be  higher  for  the  other  production  system. 

LCA  is  not  necessarily  a  linear  or  stepwise  process.  Rather,  as  suggested  by  Figure  1-1, 
information  from  any  of  the  three  components  can  complement  information  from  the  other  two 
components.  For  instance,  opportunities  for  environmental  and  human  health  improvements  do 
not  necessarily  stem  from  the  improvement  assessment  but  can  be  realized  at  any  stage  of  the 
LCA  process.  The  inventory  component  alone  may  be  used  to  identify  opportunities  for 
reducing  the  amounts  of  specific  inputs  and  outputs.  The  impact  assessment  can  provide 
additional  information  about  the  significance  of  the  inventory  items,  or  identify  priorities  for  the 
improvement  assessment.  The  impact  assessment  may  also  present  important  information 
suggesting  modification  of  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA,  or  identify  data  gaps,  research  needs, 
or  significant  uncertainties  in  the  LCA.  The  following  sections  discuss  the  relationships  between 
impact  assessment  and  the  inventory  analysis  and  improvement  assessment  components  of  LCA. 

1.2.1  Relationship  Between  Impact  Assessment  and  Inventory  Analysis 

Impact  assessment  focuses  on  describing  potential  impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health, 
and  natural  resources  through  the  use  of  a  variety  of  models.  Typically,  these  models  require 
supporting  data  (e.g.,  environmental  or  human  health  information).  Therefore,  the  type  of  data 
collected  in  the  inventory  analysis  must  be  commensurate  with  the  impact  assessment  model(s). 

Upgrading  inventory  data  may  be  necessary  to  account  for  the  specific  data  needs  of  an 
impact  assessment.  While  conducting  the  impact  assessment,  a  practitioner  may  realize  that 
additional  data  (e.g.,  toxicological,  environmental  parameters)  are  needed.  For  example,  to 
conduct  a  detailed  impact  assessment,  the  practitioner  may  need  to  have  information  on  pollution 
speciation  or  geographic  and  temporal  specificity  of  impacts.  On  the  other  hand,  certain 
inventory  data  may  not  be  required  given  the  scope  of  the  overall  LCA  and/or  the  impact 
assessment. 

The  importance  of  making  goal  statements  and  determining  scope  and  boundary 
conditions  prior  to  developing  the  inventory  is  critical.  These  activities  ensure  that  the  inventory 
has  the  appropriate  data  needed  for  conducting  the  impact  assessment  or  that  additional  data 
collection  has  been  planned,  if  needed.  Inadequate  planning  can  lead  to  needing  additional  data 
later,  which  may  cause  unplanned  expenditures  or  the  exclusion  of  items  from  the  impact 
assessment. 


1-8 


1.2.2  Relationship  Between  Impact  Assessment  and  Improvement  Assessment 

The  purpose  of  the  improvement  assessment  component  of  LCA  is  to  identify  and 
evaluate  opportunities  for  reducing  or  mediating  environmental  impacts.  Opportunities  to 
achieve  improvements  may  be  identified  at  any  stage  of  the  LCA  process.  Impact  assessment 
provides  a  means  of  identifying  improvement  opportunities  on  the  basis  of  impacts.  Although 
inventory  results  can  be  used  to  identify  opportunities  for  improvement,  impact  assessment  can 
take  this  information  one  step  further  to  assess  the  impacts  of  the  inventory.  Also,  an  impact 
assessment  supplements  the  improvement  assessment  by  providing  baseline  information  and 
identifying  variables  that  will  require  further  monitoring.  Thus,  the  complexity  of  the  impact 
assessment  must  be  matched  with  the  final  end  use  of  the  resulting  information  from  the 
improvement  assessment.  Once  again,  scoping  plays  a  large  role  in  maintaining  consistency 
between  the  LCA  components. 

Options  identified  in  the  improvement  assessment  should  be  evaluated  to  ensure  that  the 
improvement  programs  do  not  create  additional,  unanticipated  impacts.  For  example,  during  the 
improvement  stage  the  practitioner  may  discover  impacts  from  proposed  improvements 
themselves  that  were  not  considered  in  the  initial  impact  assessment.  At  that  point,  broadening 
the  scope  of  the  impact  assessment  may  be  necessary  to  account  for  the  additional  impacts. 

Although  adjusting  the  scope  of  the  overall  LCA  or  of  each  LCA  component  to  meet 
unforeseen  events  is  possible,  maintaining  a  consistent  scope  across  the  components  is  desirable. 
This  consistency  ensures  that  the  study  uses  resources  and  time  efficiently  and  produces  results 
that  are  consistent  with  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  overall  LCA. 

1.3  APPLICATIONS  OF  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 

In  the  context  of  LCA,  impact  assessment  may  be  perceived  as  one  tool  that 
decisionmakers  use  in  the  LCA  decision  development  and  improvement  implementation  stages. 
As  standard  procedures  and  techniques  for  impact  assessment  are  developed  and  refined,  impact 
assessment  will  enhance  the  quality  of  the  decision  and  provide  the  decisionmaker  with  a  better 
frame  of  reference  within  which  to  make  the  decision. 

In  the  present-day  context  of  LCA,  impact  assessment  may  be  useful  for 

•  characterizing  the  environmental  impacts  of  inventory  items, 

•  uncovering  significant  cross-media  transfers  of  impacts, 

•  incorporating  environmental  and  human  health  concerns  into  the  decisionmaking 
process. 


1-9 


•  evaluating  impacts  for  their  relevance  to  predetermined  LCA  goals  and  objectives,  and 

•  translating  all  impacts  and  their  determined  importance  to  the  LCA  audience  in  a  clear 
and  concise  manner  (Canadian  Standards  Association,  1992). 

Specific  applications  of  impact  assessment  extend  beyond  those  of  inventory  analysis. 
Although  an  inventory  analysis  provides  a  quantified  listing  of  inputs  and  outputs,  an  impact 
assessment  relates  these  items  to  resulting  environmental  impacts  in  a  meaningful  manner.  For 
purposes  of  this  document,  two  general  types  of  LCA  applications  are  distinguished: 

1 .  Internal  applications  —  where  results  are  used  within  an  organization  and  are  not 
intended  for  public  release;  and 

2.  External  applications  —  where  results  are  used,  or  are  intended  for  use,  in  a  more 
public  context. 

As  shown  in  Figure  1-2,  the  scope  and  degree  of  quantification  generally  increase  in 
moving  from  internal  to  external  LCA  applications.  The  broader  scope  and  higher  degree  of 
quantification  is  often  needed  for  externally  applied  studies  that  must  withstand  widespread 
public  scrutiny.  Table  1-2  provides  an  overview  of  a  range  of  internal  and  external  applications 
of  impact  assessment.

1.3.1  Internal  Applications 

An  internal  application  of  impact  assessment  is  one  in  which  results  are  never  intended  to 
be,  and  are  never,  released  to  the  public  (EPA,  1992a).  An  organization  may  conduct  such  an 
impact  assessment,  for  example,  to  determine  which  production  process  exposes  the  organization 
to  the  least  current  and  future  regulatory  liability. 

For  internal  impact  assessments,  the  sponsoring  organization  is  not  required  to  justify  the 
methods,  data  sources,  and  items  included  and/or  excluded  outside  the  organization.  Within  the 
organization,  these  aspects  of  the  LCA  may  or  may  not  require  as  rigorous  a  justification  as 
needed  for  an  external  application.  While  internal  applications  may  not  be  required  to  follow 
stringent  LCA  guidelines,  they  should  nonetheless  follow  the  best  practice.  However,  if  the 
study  results  may  be  used  externally  at  a  later  date,  consideration  should  be  given  to  conducting 
the  assessment  in  the  same  manner  as  an  external  study. 


1-11 


Using  a  holistic,  systematic  approach  to  impact  assessment  that  considers  decisionmaking 
factors  that  were  once  outside  the  corporate  sphere  may  significantly  alter  the  corporate 
decisionmaking  process.  Corporations  may  find  that  performing  an  impact  assessment  is  in  their 
best  interest  because  it  may  lead  to  impact  reduction  through  waste  minimization,  more  efficient 
production  processes,  and  bottom-line  cost  savings. 

1.3.2  External  Applications 

An  external  application  of  an  impact  assessment  is  one  in  which  results  are  made 
available  outside  the  sponsoring  organization  (EPA,  1992a).  External  impact  assessment  results 
may  require  more  rigorous  justification  because  they  are  open  to  additional  scrutiny  and  thus 
may  be  faced  with  more  intense  peer  review  and  disclosure  of  methods  and  results. 

The  public  may  expect  external  impact  assessments  to  abide  by  impact  assessment 
guidelines  that  represent  a  wide  consensus  of  opinion.  If  guidelines  are  not  followed,  the  public 
may  request  the  sponsoring  organization  to  provide  information  regarding  the  deviation  from 
those  guidelines.  This  request  may  be  the  case  when  the  impact  assessment  results  are  used  to 
support  marketing  claims  that  make  product  comparisons  and  may  significantly  affect  other 
external  entities,  or  when  the  results  might  affect  public  policy. 

1.4  CURRENT  STATE  OF  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT  PRACTICE 

World  Wildlife  Fund  (1991)  recently  updated  a  survey  of  three  LCA 
practitioners — Battelle,  Franklin  Associates,  Ltd.,  and  Tellus  Institute — to  provide  an  overview 
of  the  state  of  impact  assessment  practice.  Table  1-3  reports  some  of  these  results  and  describes 
the  types  of  environmental  and  human  health  analyses  currently  performed  by  these  three 
recognized  LCA  practitioners,  as  well  as  various  methodological  approaches  used  in  impact 
assessment. 

In  addition,  an  industry  survey  by  Sullivan  and  Ehrenfeld  (1992)  explored  several 
companies’  uses  of  analytic  tools  and  programs  designed  to  account  for  impacts  throughout  a 
product’s  life  cycle.  The  survey  revealed  that  the  environmental  impacts  and  life-cycle  stages 
addressed  by  companies  were  fairly  consistent.  Air,  water,  soil  emissions,  and  solid  waste 
generation  were  addressed  by  all  companies  surveyed,  and  natural  resource  and  energy  use  were 
addressed  by  eight  of  ten  life-cycle  frameworks.  Habitat  alteration  was  addressed  by  four  of  the 
ten  frameworks,  but  biodiversity  was  rarely  addressed. 

The  survey  also  found  that,  although  many  of  the  impact  assessment  frameworks  used 
included  elements  that  demonstrate  life-cycle  thinking,  these  frameworks  are  not  standardized. 
Instead,  they  range  from  quantitative  assessment  techniques  (e.g.,  indexing  the  importance  of 


1-12 


various  impacts)  to  more  subjective  techniques,  such  as  consensus  building  and  professional 
judgment  (Sullivan  and  Ehrenfeld,  1992).

1.5  SCOPE  OF  THIS  DOCUMENT 

This  document  outlines  a  conceptual  framework,  discusses  key  issues,  and  summarizes 
existing  impact  assessment  methods.  Chapter  2  discusses  key  issues  related  to  the  current  use 
and  future  development  of  impact  assessment.  These  issues  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, 
standardization  of  the  impact  assessment  framework,  scoping,  uncertainty,  data  quality,  value 
judgments,  transparency,  expert  review,  and  presentation  of  results. 

Chapter  3  outlines  a  conceptual  framework  for  impact  assessment,  which  includes  three 
phases:  classification  of  inventory  items  into  impact  categories,  characterization  of  selected 
impacts,  and  valuation  of  impacts  within  and  between  impact  categories.  This  chapter  also 
discusses  the  different  levels  of  analysis  in  the  characterization  phase,  from  less  detailed  loading 
assessment  to  more  detailed  risk  assessment. 

Chapters  4  through  7  summarize  existing  methods  that  have  been  presented,  discussed,  or 
used  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment.  Chapter  4  profiles  existing  methods  for  characterizing 
impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and  natural  resources.  Chapter  5  discusses  issues  related 
to  resource  depletion  and  describes  some  existing  methods  for  characterizing  resource  depletion. 
Chapter  6  presents  those  methods  that  apply  to  the  valuation  phase  of  impact  assessment. 

Chapter  7  profiles  integrated  approaches  that  combine  two  or  more  phases  of  impact 


1-14 


assessment,  typically  the  characterization  and  valuation  phases.  Chapter  8  reiterates  key  points 
regarding  impact  assessment  and  discusses  potential  future  research  needs  to  fill  gaps  in  existing 
impact  assessment  procedures  and  methods  as  well  as  to  better  define  the  overall  role  of  impact 
assessment  in  the  LCA  process. 

Procedures  and  experience  learned  from  environmental  impact  assessment  as  defined  by 
the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  are  included  in  Appendix  A.  Untested  methods 
potentially  useful  for  impact  assessment  are  profiled  in  Appendix  B.  Appendix  C  provides  key 
terms  and  definitions,  and  Appendix  D  is  a  bibliography  of  LCA-related  literature.

CHAPTER  2 

KEY  ISSUES  SURROUNDING  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 


Much  of  the  current  focus  in  the  development  of  impact  assessment  is  determining  how 
to  apply  a  wide  variety  of  possible  tools  and  methods  within  the  impact  assessment  framework. 
This  chapter  discusses  key  issues  related  to  the  future  development  of  impact  assessment, 
including,  but  not  limited  to,  standardization  of  the  impact  assessment  framework,  scoping, 
uncertainty,  data  quality,  value  judgments,  transparency,  expert  review,  and  presentation  of 
results. 

2.1  STANDARDIZATION  OF  THE  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT  FRAMEWORK 

Increasing  use  of  LCAs  has  resulted  in  a  broad  recognition  that  some  degree  of 
standardization  of  methodology  is  necessary  to  increase  replicability  and  comparability,  as  well 
as  public  and  peer  confidence  in  external  LCA  studies  (Denison,  1992b).  To  develop  a 
standardized  impact  assessment  framework,  practitioners  must  agree  not  only  on  the  conceptual 
aspects  of  impact  assessment  but  also  on  other  procedural  aspects  of  impact  assessment  as  well. 
These  aspects  might  include 

•  a  set  of  steps  for  the  impact  assessment  practitioner  to  follow, 

•  a  standardized  list  or  checklist  of  impacts  for  the  practitioner  to  consider, 

•  a  common  format  for  peer/expert  review  activities, 

•  a  code  of  good  practice  for  impact  assessment  as  part  of  overall  LCA  studies,  and 

•  a  standardized  presentation  format  for  impact  assessment  results. 

However,  the  question  remains:  Is  it  possible,  and  desirable,  to  develop  a  standardized 
impact  assessment  framework,  or  should  the  choice  of  framework  be  left  to  the  practitioner? 
Although  leaving  the  choice  of  impact  assessment  framework  to  the  practitioner  may  be 
amenable  for  a  wide  variety  of  study  scenarios  and  circumstances,  using  a  standardized  impact 
assessment  framework  could  provide  the  following  benefits: 

•  Users  could  make  relative  comparisons  of  studies  without  having  to  translate  LCA 
studies  to  a  common  denominator. 

•  Potential  misuse  of  impact  assessment  results  to  achieve  a  particular  purpose  or  goal 
would  be  controlled. 

•  Practitioners  would  have  objective  guidelines  for  conducting  an  impact  assessment. 


2-1 


•  A  standard  listing  of  impact  categories  would  remove  some  subjectivity  in  selecting 
impacts  and  would  facilitate  comparison  between  studies. 

•  Analysts  would  be  able  to  incorporate  results  of  other  external  LCAs  into  their  studies. 

•  A  consistent  set  of  inventory  and  impact  assessment  data  would  be  available  to  all 
interested  parties. 

On  the  other  hand,  a  standardized  framework  for  impact  assessment  may  have  little  effect 
on  LCA  practices.  For  example,  despite  the  development  of  guidelines  for  conducting  inventory 
analysis,  a  number  of  significant  discrepancies  still  exist  in  life-cycle  inventory  studies.  Among 
other  things,  these  discrepancies  include  differences  in  the  definitions  of  the  scope  and  process 
boundaries. 

Only  a  few  impact  assessments  have  been  conducted,  and  impact  assessment  procedures 
are  still  in  their  formative  stages.  Any  standardized  framework  will  undoubtedly  be  a  function  of 
future  impact  assessment  research  and  experience.  Therefore,  researchers  suggested  using  a 
phased  approach  in  which  an  initial  impact  assessment  framework  is  developed  with  presently 
available  methods.  Later,  experience  and  insights  derived  from  using  the  framework  can  be  used 
to  refine  and/or  develop  new  methods. 

In  this  approach,  experts  develop  and  agree  upon  general  principles  and  procedures, 
analysts  begin  preliminary  case  studies  using  these  principles  and  procedures,  and  experts  use 
feedback  from  preliminary  studies  to  identify  areas  of  need  and  to  refine  or  redevelop  the  impact 
assessment  process.  Figure  2- 1  provides  a  conceptual  illustration  of  the  phased-approach  to 
impact  assessment  development. 

A  phased  approach  would  allow  researchers  to  use  existing  methods  available  for  impact 
assessment  while  methods  to  fill  gaps  or  analyze  more  difficult-to-determine  impacts,  such  as 
habitat  destruction,  are  developed.  In  addition,  this  approach  would  continue  LCA  and  impact 
assessment  case  studies  rather  than  delaying  them  in  hopes  of  establishing  the  “ideal”  approach. 

2.2  USE  OF  SCOPING  IN  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 

Scoping — deciding  what  will  and  will  not  be  included  in  the  study — is  an  integral  part  of 
LCA.  In  general,  the  impact  assessment  should  consider  all  inputs  and  outputs  compiled  in  the 
inventory.  The  assessment  should  also  include  justifiable  reasons  for  any  exclusions.  Any 
justifiable  reasons  for  any  exclusions  will  be  tied  to  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA. 


2-2 


Figure  2-1.  Phased  Approach  to  Impact  Assessment  Development 


On  the  other  hand,  in  conducting  an  impact  assessment,  the  practitioner  may  need  to 
reevaluate  the  scope  (to  identify  inventory  items  or  impacts  that  will  need  additional  data 
support),  define  which  impacts  are  relevant  to  the  LCA,  and  define  the  intended  application  or 
end  use  of  the  impact  assessment  results.  Currently  no  set  of  rules  exists  that  govern  the  type  of 
information  that  can  be  used  in  an  impact  assessment,  nor  is  there  a  clear  need  for  one. 

To  define  the  scope  of  an  impact  assessment,  the  practitioner  may  find  it  useful  to 
consider  some  primary  scoping  parameters  specific  to  the  impact  assessment.  These  parameters 
might  include  the  level  of  detail  of  the  impact  assessment,  product  system/potential  impact 
boundaries,  and  the  type  of  impact  information  required  by  decisionmakers.  Some  generic 
scoping  parameters  that  are  a  function  of  the  overall  LCA  include  the  following: 

•  matching  the  scope  of  the  impact  assessment  to  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  LCA, 

•  identifying  key  inventory  data  that  are  missing  or  uncertain, 

•  identifying  the  variability  of  inventory  data, 

•  identifying  the  impacts  to  be  studied, 

•  recognizing  the  purpose(s)  for  conducting  an  impact  assessment, 

•  determining  how  the  results  of  the  impact  assessment  are  to  be  used. 


2-3 


•  providing  justification  for  excluding  any  elements, 

•  determining  the  level  of  impacts  to  be  studied  (source,  media,  or  receptor), 

•  considering  the  audience  to  which  results  will  be  presented,  and 

•  defining  spatial  and  temporal  boundaries  (SET AC,  1993). 

No  one  “correct  scope”  can  be  assigned  to  all  impact  assessments.  The  scope  of  an  impact 
assessment  will  inevitably  be  a  function  of  a  number  of  study-specific  variables  such  as  goals, 
scope,  and  data  limitations. 

One  important  point  to  consider  when  initiating  an  impact  assessment,  or  LCA  in 
general,  is  the  “nonthreshold  assumption.”  The  nonthreshold  assumption  simply  says  that  no 
threshold  exists  for  considering  environmental  loadings  in  an  impact  assessment.  In  other 
words,  despite  seemingly  insignificant  quantities,  inventory  items  nonetheless  contribute 
cumulatively  to  impacts  and  therefore  may  need  to  be  considered  in  the  impact  assessment.  For 
example,  the  energy  used  to  manufacture  a  single  automobile  likely  does  not  release  enough  SO2 
to  the  atmosphere  to  cause  an  appreciable  rise  in  regional  acid  precipitation.  However,  when 
those  SO2  emissions  are  considered  in  the  context  of  additional  regional  emissions,  the  SO2 
emissions  may  be  considered  a  contributor  to  the  regional  acid  precipitation  and  thus  the  SO2 
emissions  may  warrant  consideration  in  the  impact  assessment. 

The  nonthreshold  assumption  may  be  of  greater  significance  for  some  inventory  items 
compared  to  others.  For  example,  low  concentrations  of  a  noncarcinogenic,  nonpersistent 
pollutant  may  be  below  a  threshold  of  concern  for  human  health  effects.  Practitioners  may  need 
to  consider  the  appropriateness  of  the  nonthreshold  assumption  for  each  inventory  item  with 
respect  to  the  potential  impact  being  assessed. 

Incorporating  the  nonthreshold  assumption  into  impact  assessment  not  only  provides 
justification  for  considering  all  inventory  items  in  impact  assessment,  but  also  provides  impetus 
for  assessing  the  relative  contribution  of  those  inventory  items  to  specific  impact  categories.  In 
other  words,  the  nonthreshold  assumption  makes  it  appropriately  difficult  for  LCA  practitioners 
to  eliminate  inventory  items  from  further  consideration  on  the  basis  that  the  quantity  of 
inventory  items  is  too  insignificant  to  contribute  to  impacts. 

One  concern  with  using  the  nonthreshold  assumption  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment 
is  the  possibility  of  misinterpreting  the  outcome  of  the  impact  assessment  to  represent  actual 
causal  association  between  inventory  items  and  impacts.  To  avoid  this  situation,  practitioners 
should  make  the  use  of  the  nonthreshold  assumption  transparent  to  users  of  the  impact 
assessment.  Section  2.8  discusses  an  approach  for  summarizing  the  results  of  an  impact 


2-4 


assessment,  providing  a  format  to  clearly  communicate  specific  aspects  of  the  assessment  such  as 
the  nonthreshold  assumption. 

Scoping  in  impact  assessment  may  draw  in  part  from  the  scoping  process  required  as  part 
of  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  by  the  U.S.  Council  on  Environmental  Quality 
(CEQ)  in  response  to  NEPA  of  1969.  The  EIA  scoping  process  is  described  in  Appendix  A. 

2.3  COMMUNICATING  UNCERTAINTY  IN  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 

Determining  fate  and  effects  of  pollutants  and  substances  in  the  natural  environment  is 
extremely  difficult.  Uncertainty  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment  extends  beyond  that  in  the 
inventory  analysis.  Inventory  data  usually  are  based  on  many  assumptions,  represent  aggregated 
or  averaged  measures,  contain  many  gaps,  and  are  broad  in  nature  (e.g.,  data  from  different  plants 
with  different  levels  of  technology).  Nonetheless  these  data  typically  are  measurable  inputs  and 
outputs  that  can  often  times  be  bounded  with  some  type  of  measure  (e.g.,  range)  of  uncertainty. 
Because  inventory  data  are  the  primary  inputs  for  impact  assessment,  the  range  of  uncertainty 
associated  with  the  impact  assessment  model  is  partly  dependent  on  the  range  of  uncertainty 
associated  with  the  inventory  data.  However,  additional  uncertainties  are  introduced  in  the 
impact  assessment  stage  of  an  LCA.  Section  2.3.3  discusses  specific  methods  for  uncertainty 
analysis.  Practitioners  should  describe  and  discuss  the  uncertainties  associated  with  LCA  impact 
assessment  methods,  data,  and  results. 

2.3.1  Translating  Inventory  Items  to  Impacts 

A  primary  issue  in  impact  assessment  is  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  linking  of 
inventory  items  to  impacts.  Scientific  information  may  indicate  that  various  inventory  items  are 
associated  with,  or  have  been  shown  to  cause  particular  effects.  However,  it  is  difficult  (if  not 
impossible)  to  prove  that  a  specific  input  or  output  from  a  specific  LCA  causes  an  actual  effect. 
Thus  the  results  of  the  impact  assessment  will  likely  not  prove  that  the  product  system  under 
consideration  actually  caused  such  impacts.  None  the  less,  a  link  can  often  be  made  between  an 
inventory  item  and  a  potential  impact,  or  multiple  impacts.  For  example,  SO2  emissions  have 
been  linked  to  the  formation  of  acid  precipitation,  which  in  turn  can  lead  to  other  impacts  such  as 
tree  damage,  acidification  of  lakes,  corrosion  of  buildings  and  materials,  and  the  leaching  of 
heavy  metals  from  soils. 

The  causal  uncertainty  described  above  is  primarily  a  result  of  limited  understanding  of 
such  concepts  as  biochemical,  physiological,  and  environmental  interactions;  fate  and  transport  of 
substances  released  in  an  environmental  setting;  and  the  distribution  of  nonchemical  stresses 
(e.g.,  heat,  noise).  Factors  that  may  need  to  be  considered  to  understand  impact  linkages  include: 


2-5 


•  the  spatial  and  temporal  scales  of  environmental  loadings, 

•  interactions  among  human-induced  loadings  and  natural  loadings, 

•  natural  variability  and  the  problems  of  discriminating  from  “background  noise,”  and 

•  the  different  modes  of  action  of  the  loading  on  the  environment  (EPA,  1992d). 

As  a  result  of  these  factors,  impact  networks  are  often  diverse,  nonlinear,  and  largely 
site-specific,  and  involve  a  wide  range  of  potential  impacts  at  various  thresholds.  Although 
increased  research  in  these  areas  may  reduce  a  substantial  amount  of  uncertainty,  certain  aspects 
of  this  uncertainty  are  intrinsically  irreducible — for  example,  natural  climatic  variations  among 
different  locations.  In  addition,  inventory  data  are  generally  not  site-specific,  which  adds 
additional  uncertainty  to  the  analysis. 

Clearly,  a  considerable  array  of  complexities  and  uncertainties  exist  when  translating 
inventory  into  potential  impacts.  A  key  issue  is  how  to  account  for  and  communicate  this 
uncertainty  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment  or  in  the  impact  networks  themselves.  Some 
possible  ways  of  incorporating  uncertainty  into  impact  networks  include  quantitative  approaches 
such  as  incorporating  probabilities  or  measures  of  compounded  uncertainty  into  the  linkages 
between  inventory  items  and  potential  impacts  and  qualitative  approaches  such  as  using  a  set  of 
qualitative  evaluative  criteria. 

Quantitative  Approaches 

Some  possible  ways  of  incorporating  uncertainty  into  inventory-to-impact  links  or 
impact-to-impact  links  include,  among  other  things,  incorporating  probabilities  or  measures  of 
compounded  uncertainty  into  the  links.  In  doing  so,  the  practitioner  must  bear  in  mind  that  the 
two  concepts  have  largely  different  effects  on  the  expression  of  causal  association,  as  described 
below: 

1 .  Joint  Probability:  When  given  two  events,  A  and  B,  the  probability  of  both  A  and 
B  occurring  is  the  product  of  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  A  times  the 
conditional  probability  of  event  B  occurring  (i.e.,  the  probability  of  event  B 
occurring  given  that  event  A  has  occurred).  For  example,  consider  the  case  where 
life-cycle  inventory  item  X  leads  to  potential  impact  A  with  a  probability  of  0.5, 
and  potential  impact  A  leads  to  potential  impact  B  with  a  probability  of  0.5  (none  of 
these  statements  involves  uncertainty).  One  can  then  state,  on  the  basis  of  joint 
probability,  that  the  probability  of  life-cycle  inventory  item  X  leading  to  potential 
impact  B  is  0.25  (0.5  x  0.5),  and  uncertainty  plays  no  role. 

2.  Compounded  Uncertainty:  Using  the  above  format,  when  given  two  events, 

A  and  B,  each  with  a  given  range  of  uncertainty,  the  likelihood  of  both  A  and  B 
occurring  is  the  products  of  the  ranges  of  uncertainty.  For  example,  consider  again 


2-6 


the  case  where  life-cycle  inventory  item  X  leads  to  potential  impact  A  with  a  range 
of  probability  of  0.2  to  0.8,  and  potential  impact  A  leads  to  potential  impact  B  with  a 
range  of  probability  of  0.2  to  0.8.  The  effect  of  compounded  uncertainty  is  that  one 
can  only  say  that  the  likelihood  of  life-cycle  inventory  item  X  leading  to  potential 
impact  B  is  between  0.04  and  0.64  (0.2  x  0.2  and  0.8  x  0.8). 

The  above  examples  illustrate  a  key  distinction  between  joint  probability  and 
compounded  uncertainty.  Unlike  joint  probability,  compounded  uncertainty  does  not  make 
further  potential  impacts  less  likely  to  occur  but  instead  makes  them  increasingly  more  difficult 
to  predict.  This  key  difference  should  be  kept  in  mind  if  either  of  these  two  methods  are  used  as 
expressions  of  causal  association. 

In  many  impact  assessments  practitioners  would  not  likely  develop  quantitative  measures 
of  joint  probability  or  compounded  uncertainty  for  relating  inventory  items  to  impacts  but  rather 
would  express  the  inventory  data  as  means  and  variances  or  ranges. 

Qualitative  Approaches 

A  possible  qualitative  approach  to  evaluating  causal  relationships  among  inventory  items 
and  impacts  in  an  impact  assessment  is  to  use  a  set  of  evaluative  criteria,  such  as  those  suggested 
by  Hill  (1965): 

•  strength  (a  high  magnitude  of  impact  is  associated  with  a  particular  loading) 

•  consistency  (the  association  is  repeatedly  observed  under  different  circumstances) 

•  specificity  (the  impact  is  diagnostic  of  a  loading) 

•  temporality  (the  loading  precedes  the  impact  in  time) 

•  presence  of  a  biological  gradient  (a  positive  correlation  between  loading  and  impact) 

•  a  plausible  mechanism  of  action 

•  coherence  (the  hypothesis  does  not  conflict  with  knowledge  of  natural  history) 

•  experimental  evidence 

•  analogy  (similar  loadings  cause  similar  impacts) 

Although  not  all  of  these  criteria  need  be  satisfied  to  support  causal  association,  each  will 
incrementally  reinforce  the  argument  for  causality.  The  presence  of  refuting  evidence  does  not 
necessarily  rule  out  causality.  Instead,  it  may  represent  an  incomplete  understanding  of  the 
complex  relationships  at  hand.

2.3.2  Impact  Assessment  Results 

Even  if  impact  assessment  were  able  to  provide  a  direct  measure  of  uncertainty,  the 
concern  remains  about  compounding  uncertainties  from  the  inventory  with  uncertainties  from  an 
impact  assessment.  That  is,  when  the  LCA  practitioner  uses  inventory  data  with  much 
uncertainty  associated  with  it  and  then  incorporates  the  uncertainties  associated  with  the  impact 
assessment  process  described  above,  the  resulting  information  is  questionable  in  the 
decisionmaking  process.  Uncertainties  surrounding  different  components  of  the  environmental 
impacts  evaluation  affect  the  analyst’s  confidence  in  making  a  specific  conclusion  (EPA, 

1994b). 

Uncertainty  clearly  plays  a  large  role  in  impact  assessment.  This  is  not  to  say  that  LCA 
or  impact  assessment  has  no  use  as  a  decisionmaking  tool,  because  all  decisionmaking  tools 
contain  some  degree  of  uncertainty  whether  or  not  it  is  explicit.  For  example,  similar  problems 
exist  in  the  field  of  risk  assessment  where  analysts  are  constantly  faced  with  data-input 
limitations  and  exposure  and  effect  uncertainties.  Like  risk  assessments,  impact  assessment  can 
be  performed  with  all  levels  of  information,  from  abysmal  to  excellent,  and  can  address  a  variety 
of  levels  of  assessment,  from  release  of  individual  substances  to  an  environmental  media  to  the 
release  of  multiple  substances  to  multiple  environmental  media. 

The  key  point  is  that  the  lower  the  quality  of  the  information  and  models  used  in  the 
assessment,  the  more  uncertain  the  outcome.  Therefore,  developing  a  method  of  identifying  and 
communicating  uncertainty  should  benefit  the  users  of  impact  assessment.  Some  general  areas 
of  impact  assessment  that  may  be  used  as  indicators  of  the  overall  certainty  or  uncertainty  of  the 
assessment,  and  thus  affect  the  quality  and  usefulness  of  results,  might  include  the  following: 

•  quality  of  input  data, 

•  structure  of  impact  characterization  model, 

•  type  of  model  testing,  and 

•  level  of  expert  review. 

2.3.3  Methods  of  Uncertainty  and  Sensitivity  Analysis 

Both  quantitative  and  qualitative  techniques  are  available  for  expressing  data  quality  in 
the  context  of  impact  assessment.  These  methods  include  the  following: 


2-8 


Quantitative  Methods 

•  confidence  interval/data  variability  estimation 

•  accuracy,  precision,  and  degree  of  bias  measurement 

•  goodness  of  fit  evaluation 

•  sensitivity  analysis 

•  uncertainty  analysis 

Qualitative  Methods 

•  limitations  of  life-cycle  inventory  data  for  predicting  impacts 

•  validity,  accuracy,  and  limitations  of  classifying  inventory  items  into  impact  categories 

•  validity,  accuracy,  and  limitations  of  conversion  models  used 

Techniques  such  as  sensitivity  analysis  or  uncertainty  analysis  may  provide  useful 
starting  points  for  impact  assessment.  Sensitivity  analysis  is  a  systematic  procedure  for 
estimating  the  effects  of  data  uncertainties  on  the  outcome  of  a  computational  model  (EPA, 
1993a).  It  provides  a  means  of  determining  what  does  and  does  not  matter  in  a  computational 
model.  Researchers  have  recognized  that  applying  sensitivity  analysis  in  the  context  of  impact 
assessment  may  be  useful  in  theory  only,  because  it  requires  the  quite  difficult  process  of 
developing  mathematical  models  to  evaluate  system  parameters  (EPA,  1994b).  However, 
analysts  may  be  able  to  develop  variations  of  sensitivity  analysis  methods  that  better  fit  the  needs 
of  impact  assessment.  Table  2-1  describes  proposed  methods  for  sensitivity  analysis  in  the 
context  of  impact  assessment.  For  further  discussions  of  these  methods  and  their  potential 
future  applicability  to  LCA,  the  reader  is  referred  to  EPA  (1992b). 

Uncertainty  analysis  identifies,  discusses,  and  quantifies,  to  the  extent  possible,  the 
uncertainty  in  identifying  and  characterizing  potential  impacts.  The  total  uncertainty  in  the  LCA 
represents  cumulative  uncertainties  from  each  phase  of  impact  assessment.  Using  uncertainty 
analysis,  a  practitioner  can  evaluate  the  effect  of  uncertainties  on  the  overall  impact  assessment 
and,  when  applicable,  determine  ways  for  reducing  uncertainty.  In  addition  to  providing  the 
practitioner  with  insight  to  the  impact  assessment’s  strengths  and  weaknesses,  uncertainty 
analysis  can  also  be  used  as  a  basis  for  decisionmaking  purposes  among  comparative 
assessments. 

Table  2-2  lists  various  methods  for  uncertainty  analysis  and  their  advantages.  For  further 
discussions  of  the  use  of  these  methods  in  the  context  of  LCA,  the  reader  is  directed  to  EPA 
(1992b).

2.4  DATA  AVAILABILITY  AND  QUALITY  CONCERNS  IN  IMPACT 

ASSESSMENT 

Recent  LCA  forums  (SET AC  LCA  Data  Quality  Workshop,  Wintergreen,  Virginia, 
October  4-9,  1992;  and  SET  AC  Data  Quality  Open  Forum,  Washington,  D.C.,  February  18, 
1993)  recognized  that  data  quality  is  an  integral  component  of  the  LCA  process.  LCA  must  be 
able  to  accommodate  varying  degrees  of  data  availability,  data  types,  and  data  quality.  Because 
of  the  multiple  and  significant  ways  in  which  LCA  information  can  be  used,  identifying  and 
evaluating  data  quality  and  their  relationship  to  LCA  methodology  are  important.  The  following 
discussion  of  data  quality  issues  focuses  only  on  issues  that  are  more  specific  to  impact 
assessment. 

EPA  (1994b)  has  recently  developed  guidelines  to  aid  LCA  practitioners  in  assessing  the 
quality  of  data  used  in  inventory  analyses.  Data  quality  is  defined  in  this  document  as  the  degree 
of  confidence  an  analyst  has  in  a  data  source  or  a  data  value  based  on  defined  data  quality  goals, 
data  quality  indicators,  and  the  role  of  data  quality  in  the  overall  context  of  the  LCA  (EPA, 
1994b).  These  guidelines  provide  a  framework  for  integrating  data  quality  assessment  into  the 
inventory  analysis  process.

Similar  to  the  framework  discussed  above,  a  data  quality  assessment  framework  is 
needed  to  integrate  data  quality  assessment  into  the  impact  assessment  process.  Currently  no 
protocol  has  been  developed  for  assessing  the  quality  of  data  in  impact  assessments.  In  addition 
to  the  quality  of  data  received  from  inventory,  practitioners  must  also  consider  the  quality  of 
additional  data  (e.g.,  toxicity,  bioaccumulation,  assimilation,  equivalency  factors,  etc.)  needed  to 
conduct  an  impact  assessment. 

The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  outline  some  of  the  significant  data  quality  issues  facing 
impact  assessment.  With  very  few  impact  studies  to  draw  from,  pinpointing  all  the  data  quality 
issues  that  will  be  integral  to  impact  assessment  is  very  difficult.  However,  a  recent  Tellus 
Institute  analysis  of  impacts  associated  with  the  production  and  disposal  of  packaging  materials 
found  basic  problems  that  were  related  to  data  used  as  input  parameters  for  impact  analysis, 
including  the  following: 


2-11 


•  A  lack  of  systematic  data  on  some  components  of  the  product  system  limited  the  scope 
of  the  analysis  as  well  as  the  modeling  of  significant  processes  or  activities. 

•  Publicly  available  databases  often  contained  out-of-date  data  (Tellus  Institute,  1992a). 

2.4.1  Evaluating  Data  Availability 

Although  the  lack  of  available  data  required  for  impact  assessment  is  a  primary  concern, 
many  sources  of  data  may  be  useful  for  conducting  an  LCA.  EPA  (1994a)  provides  a 
comprehensive  overview  of  publicly  available  data  sources  for  conducting  an  LCA.  Table  2-3 
summarizes  data  needs  for  impact  assessment  in  terms  of  a  five-tiered  system  of  increasing  data 
quality  and  decreasing  data  availability.

measures  for  resource  stocks  and  yields,  as  well  as  nonchemical 
loadings.

Assessment

and  human  health  data.

A  recent  SET  AC-sponsored  LCA  Data  Quality  Workshop  in  Wintergreen,  Virginia, 
recognized  that  currently  available  environmental  input  and  output  data  can  only  support  Tier  2- 
to  Tier  3-type  models.  Although  many  feel  that  such  a  method  can  be  improved,  others  have 
recognized  the  lack  of  information  for  Tier  2  to  Tier  5  conversion  models. 

Advancing  to  Tier  2-  and  Tier  3-type  conversion  models,  which  require  equivalency 
factors  and  chemical  properties  data,  will  require  the  inventory  to  contain  an  increased  level  of 


2-12 


chemical  and  site  specificity.  However,  such  a  level  of  data  quality  may  be  achievable  in  the 
near  term.  Tier  4-type  conversion  models  may  use  the  same  data  as  Tier  3-type  models,  only  in 
a  different  manner.  However,  in  general,  to  move  to  Tier  4-  and  Tier  5-type  conversion  models, 
process-  or  activity -specific,  unaggregated  and  unaveraged  inventory  data  will  be  needed. 
Inventory  data  are  currently  unable  to  support  such  models. 

In  the  near  term,  researchers  may  be  able  to  develop  a  database  of  information  that  is 
specifically  designed  for  use  in  LCA.  It  would  contain  a  variety  of  information  on  basic 
commodities  and  pollutants  that  serve  as  inputs  and  outputs  to  many  product  or  process  life 
cycles,  respectively.  Such  a  database  could  serve  as  a  clearinghouse  for  generic  information  for 
supporting  LCAs  and  other  types  of  residuals-based  analyses. 

2.4.2  Evaluating  Data  Quality 

As  stated  in  the  beginning  of  this  section,  data  quality  in  the  context  of  LCA  is  defined  as 
the  degree  of  confidence  an  analyst  has  in  a  data  source  or  a  data  value  (EPA,  1994b).  A 
primary  concern  with  respect  to  data  quality  in  this  context  is  the  use  of  less-than-perfect 
inventory  data  in  less-than-perfect  impact  assessment  models  as  described  in  the  previous  section 
on  uncertainty.  The  resulting  information  may  have  questionable  usefulness  for  decisionmaking 
purposes.  For  example,  aggregated  secondary  data  are  typically  used  in  inventories.  Aggregated 
data  are  not  useful  for  some  impact  assessment  methods,  such  as  fate  and  transport  models  or 
exposure  assessment,  that  require  site-specific  data  (EPA,  1994b). 

A  second  concern  in  impact  assessment  is  the  quality  of  additional  data  needed  by 
conversion  models.  The  only  type  of  conversion  model  that  does  not  require  any  additional  data 
is  loading  assessment,  where  inventory  data  are  used  directly  (see  Table  2-1).  Any  model 
beyond  loading  assessment  requires  additional  information  such  as  toxicity,  persistence, 
bioaccumulation,  and  equivalency  factors.  Even  with  the  highest  quality  inventory  data,  impact 
assessment  results  can  be  compromised  if  low  quality  information  (e.g.,  environmental 
characteristics,  toxicity  measures)  is  used  in  the  conversion  models. 

A  third  concern  is  the  quality  of  the  conversion  models  themselves.  That  is,  even  with 
perfect  input  information,  the  quality  of  impact  assessment  results  is  governed  by  the  predictive 
accuracy  of  the  conversion  model(s)  used.  This  issue  is  not  limited  to  impact  assessment  but 
includes  any  type  of  analysis  that  employs  models  to  transform  data  into  more  useful  and 
meaningful  forms.  At  this  stage  of  impact  assessment  development,  conversion  models  need  to 


2-13 


be  developed  and  validated  as  well.  Therefore,  one  of  the  goals  of  impact  assessment  may  be  to 
make  the  limitations  of  conversion  models,  as  well  as  any  additional  information  required  by  the 
models,  transparent  to  the  users  of  the  results. 

2.5  INCORPORATING  VALUE  JUDGMENTS  INTO  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 

Impact  assessment  is  similar  to  other  decisionmaking  support  systems  in  that  it  involves 
applying  subjective  value  judgments.  Nothing  is  inherently  right  or  wrong  with  value 
judgments.  All  individuals  and  institutions  have  subjective  values,  which  they  express  either 
explicitly  or  implicitly.  A  key  objective  of  impact  assessment  is  to  make  subjective  value 
judgments  transparent  so  that  users  and  others  will  know  the  basis  from  which  the  assessment 
was  conducted  and  any  conclusions  drawn.  Clearly  articulating  subjective  value  judgments  lets 
the  user  know  the  values  that  guided  the  impact  assessment. 

Both  the  practitioner  and  the  user  of  the  resulting  impact  assessment  make  value 
judgments  as  the  result  of  such  considerations  as  the  presence  of  uncertainties,  data  limitations, 
and  impact  assessment  model  limitations.  Because  different  individuals  and  institutions  have 
different  values,  there  is  no  “correct”  set  of  values  to  use  during  the  impact  assessment. 

However,  for  purposes  of  impact  assessment,  and  LCA  in  general,  developing  a  standard 
protocol  for  identifying  and  evaluating  value  judgments  may  be  worthwhile. 

In  the  face  of  incomplete  information  and  uncertain  cause-and-effect  relationships,  the 
practitioner  may  need  to  make  judgments  based  on  the  available  evidence.  The  main  problem  in 
making  value  judgments  about  cause-and-effect  relationships  is  that  directly  applicable  data  are 
often  insufficient.  In  such  a  case,  the  practitioner  must  use  value  judgments  to  make  the  best 
possible  assessment  of  the  relationship  given  the  information  at  hand.  Furthermore,  because  the 
extrapolation  of  value  judgments  depends  on  the  practitioner’s  interpretation  of  the  impact 
assessment  literature,  different  people  will  have  different  interpretations  and,  thus,  different 
value  judgments.  Unlike  other  forms  of  uncertainty  (e.g.,  measurement  and  sampling  error)  that 
can  be  generally  calculated  by  means  of  standard  procedures,  the  type  of  uncertainty  described 
above  cannot  be  directly  quantified  because  of  its  judgmental  nature. 

Value  judgments  occur  at  varying  degrees  throughout  the  impact  assessment  process. 
Within  the  impact  assessment  component,  value  judgments  can  occur  at  any  of  the  following 
points: 


2-14 


•  goal  definition  and  scoping 

•  classification  of  inventory  items  to  impact  categories 

•  determination  of  impacts  of  concern 

•  evaluation  and  selection  of  models  to  characterize  impacts  of  concern 

•  interpretation  of  results  obtained  from  impact  characterization  efforts 

•  development  of  assumptions  based  on  logic  and  scientific  principles  to  fill  data  gaps 

•  evaluation  and  selection  of  ranking  or  weighting  schemes  in  the  valuation  phase 

In  summary,  value  judgments  are  integral  parts  of  any  decisionmaking  system,  including 
environmental  policy  decisions.  In  that  regard,  impact  assessment  is  no  different  from  any  other 
public,  private,  or  individual  decision  that  can  affect  the  environment  or  human  health.  It  is 
recommended  that  practitioners  clearly  articulate  those  value  judgments  either  qualitatively  or 
quantitatively  and  discuss  the  scientific  basis  or  evidence  and  any  philosophical,  cultural,  or 
intellectual  influences  for  making  the  judgments.  Employing  a  method  such  as  encoding 
probability  judgments  may  provide  a  means  of  identifying  and  quantitatively  characterizing 
value  judgments.  Also,  this  method  would  enable  users  of  the  impact  assessment  to  understand 
the  frame  of  reference  from  which  the  impact  assessment  was  conducted,  even  though  they  may 
not  personally  agree  with  it. 

2.6  TRANSPARENCY 

Because  assumptions  and  value  judgments  are  integral  parts  of  impact  assessment  and 
many  other  decisionmaking  systems  and  they  shouldn’t  be  eliminated  in  LCAs,  their  use  must  be 
made  transparent  (i.e.,  clearly  defined).  Transparency  entails  full  disclosure  of  the  content  and 
conduct  of  the  impact  assessment  process,  including  assumptions  and  subjective  value 
judgments.  The  practitioner  should  strive  to  present  the  following  specific  aspects  of  an  impact 
assessment  in  a  transparent  manner; 

•  goals  of  the  LCA  and  impact  assessment 

•  scope  and  boundary  settings 

•  data  sources/data  quality/data  variability — uncertainty 

•  models/methods  used  in  the  impact  assessment  process 

-  assumptions 

-  limitations 

•  data  or  methodology  manipulations 


2-15 


•  value  judgments 

•  exclusions 

•  lost  information  due  to  aggregation,  etc. 

•  analyst’s  interpretation  of  the  implications  of  all  above  items  on  LCA  results 

Transparency  in  reporting  impact  assessment  results  is  important  for  replicability.  By 
fully  disclosing  all  aspects  of  an  impact  assessment,  as  listed  above,  the  practitioner  enables  an 
external  observer  or  investigator  to  start  with  the  same  original  data  and  reproduce  the  impact 
assessment  results. 

Although  barriers  to  full  disclosure  (e.g.,  proprietary  data,  practitioners’  self  interest  in 
keeping  their  methods  or  databases  to  themselves)  clearly  exist  in  LCA  studies,  practitioners 
should  strive  to  make  their  studies  as  replicable  as  possible  and  should  fully  explain  and  Justify 
factors  that  preclude  them  from  doing  so  (Denison,  1992b). 

Reproducibility  is  important  to  support  the  understanding  and  credibility  of  the  impact 
assessment  results.  For  example,  a  current  working  study  comparing  two  existing  LCAs  of 
corrugated  cardboard  found  that  differing  results  were  largely  due  to  differences  in  study  scope 
and  boundary  settings  (Ekvall,  1992b). 

2.7  EXPERT  PEER  REVIEW 

Scientific  data  and  methodologies  used  in  impact  assessment  are  based  on  information 
that  is  frequently  complex,  conflicting,  ambiguous,  or  incomplete.  Therefore,  EPA  supports  the 
creation  of  an  expert  peer  review  process  for  impact  assessment,  and  LCA  in  general,  to  advance 
the  quality  and  consistency  of  LCAs.  The  desirability  of  an  expert  peer  review  process  stems 
from  four  main  areas  of  concern:  1)  the  lack  of  understanding  of  the  scope  or  methodology  used 
in  LCAs,  2)  the  desire  to  verify  data  used  and  practitioner’s  compilation  of  data,  3)  questioning 
of  assumptions  used  and  the  overall  results,  and  4)  the  communication  of  results  (EPA,  1993a). 

Practitioners  can  evaluate  the  viability  and  accuracy  of  impact  assessments  by 
establishing  an  expert  peer  review  process  for  impact  assessment.  Expert  peer  review  can  be 
integrated  into  the  following  stages  of  impact  assessment: 

•  determining  the  purpose  and  scope  of  the  impact  assessment; 

•  evaluating  data  sources  and  the  quality  of  data  used  in  the  assessment; 

•  evaluating  and  selecting  assessment  and  measurement  endpoints; 

•  evaluating  and  selecting  conversion  models; 


2-16 


•  developing  assumptions,  etc.,  to  fill  data  gaps;  and 

•  interpreting  and  presenting  impact  assessment  results. 

The  heightened  recognition  of  the  importance  and  necessity  of  expert  peer  review  in 
LCA  studies  prompted  SETAC  to  develop  an  interim  expert  peer  review  framework.  This 
interim  framework  consists  of  four  main  steps: 

1 .  Identify  and  assemble  an  expert  peer  review  panel  based  on  specified  criteria. 

2.  Review  the  purpose,  study  boundaries,  and  databases  of  the  LCA. 

3.  Review  the  stand-alone  data  compiled  in  the  life-cycle  inventory. 

4.  Review  the  draft  final  report  (SETAC,  1992). 

The  purpose  of  this  discussion  on  expert  peer  review  is  not  to  recommend  a  specific 
approach  for  an  expert  peer  review  process  but  rather  to  identify  the  reasons  for  having  an  expert 
peer  review  process  for  impact  assessment  and  to  discuss  some  issues  for  consideration  before 
establishing  an  expert  peer  review  protocol. 

A  related  issue  is  how  to  conduct  these  expert  peer  reviews.  For  example, 

•  Should  the  expert  peer  review  process  use  a  standard  checklist  of  review  items? 

•  What  is  the  appropriate  timing  of  the  expert  peer  review  process  with  respect  to 
conducting  the  impact  assessment? 

•  Who  should  pay  for  the  review  with  respect  to  internal  and  external  applications? 

•  How  should  the  expert  peer  review  panel  members  be  chosen? 

Because  impact  assessment  is  in  its  developmental  stages  and  involves  many  concepts 
and  methods  that  have  yet  to  be  corroborated  in  practice,  the  use  of  an  expert  peer  review  panel 
will  be  a  key  role  in  shaping  the  future  of  impact  assessment.  The  expert  peer  review  panel  is 
foreseen  to  consist  of  a  relatively  small  but  diverse  group  of  individuals  with  experience  using 
impact  assessment  methods  and/or  technical  LCA  procedures.  In  addition,  although  expert  peer 
review  is  a  critical  component  of  both  internal  and  external  applications  of  impact  assessment,  a 
more  stringent  level  of  expert  peer  review  will  be  required  for  external  applications. 

2.8  PRESENTATION  OF  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT  RESULTS 

One  of  the  more  important  aspects  of  impact  assessment  is  the  manner  in  which  results 
are  presented  to  the  intended  audience.  The  results  of  an  impact  assessment  need  to  be  presented 
in  an  effective  manner  that  facilitates  the  decisionmaking  process.  Too  much  information  of  too 
many  different  types  can  result  in  information  overload,  whereas  too  little  can  hinder  the 


2-17 


decisionmaking  process.  Practitioners  should  strive  to  conduct  credible  assessments  and  present 
the  results  objectively. 

Specific  aspects  of  the  impact  assessment  that  need  to  be  documented  and  presented  to 
decisionmakers  include  the  following: 

Content  Aspects 

•  Clearly  delineate  scoping  activities,  including  how  the  boundaries  of  analysis  were

Decisionmakers  could  use  this  information  as  a  tool  to  look  at  the  overall  picture  or  to 
focus  on  a  particular  aspect  of  the  impact  assessment.  A  standard  presentation  format  would 
provide  a  clear  and  effective  means  of  communicating  the  potentially  complex  array  of 
information  inherent  in  impact  assessment  or  any  impact  analysis.  Figure  2-2  provides  a 
possible  framework  for  the  impact  assessment  summary  chart.  This  kind  of  chart  offers  a 
relatively  objective  method  of  presentation  where  impact  assessment  results  are  presented  in  the 
context  of  the  underlying  data,  methods,  assumptions,  and  limitations  used  to  achieve  those 
results.

The  impact  assessment  results  portion  of  the  summary  chart  could  become  complex  and 
overwhelming  because  of  the  large  amount  of  information  and  variety  of  different  results.  To 
help  communicate  the  impact  assessment  results  in  a  concise  and  comprehensible  manner,  a 
format  can  be  developed  for  presenting  impact  assessment  results  within  the  overall  impact 
assessment  summary  chart.  Figure  2-3  illustrates  a  possible  format  for  organizing  impact 
assessment  results  based  on  the  life-cycle  stage  and  category  in  which  the  impact  occurs.

The  impact  assessment  results  table  could  handle  both  quantitative  and  qualitative 
information.  Qualitative  information  could  be  expressed  by  symbols,  such  as  +  or  indicating 
more  or  less  significant  impacts,  or  by  circles  with  varied  degrees  of  shading,  indicating  the 
magnitude  of  the  impact. 

2.9  UNRESOLVED  ISSUES 

Because  impact  assessment  is  still  evolving,  many  issues  persist  that  may  play  a  role  in 
the  future  development  of  impact  assessment  procedures  and  methods: 

1.  Although  it  is  recognized  that  impact  assessment  is  an  inherently  value-laden 
exercise,  the  following  questions  remain: 

•  Who  makes  the  value  judgments? 

•  Is  it  feasible  to  use  external  expert  review  for  value  judgments? 

•  Should  guidelines  be  required  for  value-laden  areas,  such  as  valuation,  to  help 
minimize  the  level  of  subjectivity  in  impact  assessments? 

2.  To  control  potential  misuse  of  impact  assessments,  quality  standards  may  be  needed 
when  impact  assessments  are  used  for  external  purposes. 

3.  Specific  evaluation  methods  (conversion  models  and  impact  descriptors)  and 
valuation  methods  need  to  be  chosen  for  analyzing  specific  impact  categories. 

4.  Although  methods  such  as  risk  assessment  and  fate  and  transport  models  can  be  used 
for  impact  assessment,  analyzing  multiple  sites  may  be  overly  costly  and  impractical 
because  of  the  requirement  for  additional  data. 

5.  Much  uncertainty  persists  in  linking  inventory  items  to  impacts.  Techniques  are 
needed  to  estimate  and  integrate  this  uncertainty  into  impact  assessment. 

6.  The  political  environment  under  which  the  LCA  is  conducted  may  affect  the  scope 
and  impact  considerations. 

7.  Practicality  of  a  “cookbook”  of  impact  assessment  methods  versus  a  more 
streamlined  approach 

8.  Incorporation  of  economic  impact  (i.e.,  cost)  information  into  impact  assessment 

9.  Treatment  of  chronic  versus  acute  impacts 

10.  Effects  of  impacts  on  future  generations

subpopulations)

CHAPTER  3 

A  CONCEPTUAL  FRAMEWORK  FOR  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 


A  major  achievement  of  the  SETAC-sponsored  Life-Cycle  Impact  Analysis  Workshop 
that  took  place  in  Sandestin,  Florida,  during  February  1992,  was  the  development  of  a  three- 
phase  conceptual  framework  for  life-cycle  impact  assessment.  This  three-phase  conceptual 
framework,  illustrated  in  Figure  3-1,  contains  the  following  activities: 

1 .  Classification:  the  process  of  assignment  and  initial  aggregation  of  life-cycle 
inventory  data  to  relatively  homogeneous  groupings  of  impacts  (e.g.,  photochemical 
smog,  lung  disease,  fossil-fuel  depletion)  within  primary  impact  categories  (e.g., 
ecosystem,  human  health,  and  natural  resources). 

2.  Characterization:  the  qualitative  and/or  quantitative  evaluation  of  potential 
impacts.  The  process  of  identifying  impacts  of  concern  (called  assessment 
endpoints)  and  selecting  actual  or  surrogate  characteristics  (called  measurement 
endpoints)  to  describe  the  impacts.  Characterization  involves  using  specific  impact 
assessment  models  to  develop  impact  descriptors. 

3.  Valuation:  the  explicit  and  collective  process  of  assigning  relative  values  and/or 
weights  to  impacts  using  informal  or  formal  valuation  methods. 

In  Figure  3-1  the  flow  from  the  inventory  analysis  to  improvement  assessment  is  not 
necessarily  linear  because  the  sequence  involves  interrelationships  and  feedback  loops  among  the 
major  components.  This  is  consistent  with  the  three-component  LCA  triangle  illustrated  in 
Figure  1-1.  For  example,  not  only  can  opportunities  for  environmental  and  human  health 
improvement  be  realized  at  any  phase  of  the  LCA,  but  unplanned  modifications  may  entail 
revisiting  previously  completed  components.  Each  LCA  phase  is  discussed  in  detail  in  later 
chapters  of  this  report. 

Selecting  the  best-suited  approach  for  conducting  a  particular  impact  assessment  from  a 
variety  of  available  methods  is  important.  Practitioners  can  use  the  following  key  decision  points 
to  help  select  the  best-suited  approach  and  shape  the  assessment: 

•  selecting  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  study, 

•  learning  stakeholder  values  and  information  needs,  and 

•  characterizing  the  desired  results.

Figure  3-1.  Conceptual  Framework  for  Life-Cycle  Impact  Assessment 


3-2 


Figure  3-2  illustrates  how  these  key  LCA  decision  points  fit  in  the  LCA  conceptual 
framework,  emphasizing  the  impact  assessment  component.  The  decision  points  would  be 
constantly  revisited  throughout  the  impact  assessment  and  especially  in  the  following  impact 
assessment  activities: 

•  classifying  inventory  items  into  impact  categories; 

•  determining  impacts,  or  categories  of  impacts,  of  concerns; 

•  choosing  a  model,  or  models,  to  characterize  impacts;  and 

•  valuing  impacts,  or  categories  of  impacts. 

3.1  CLASSIFICATION 

When  inventory  items  are  taken  from,  or  released  to,  the  environment,  they  are 
considered  potential  causes  of  environmental  and  human  health  impacts.  The  classification 
phase  of  impact  assessment  provides  a  preliminary  link  between  inventory  items  and  potential 
impacts.  The  overall  purpose  of  the  classification  phase  is  to  organize  and  possibly  aggregate 
inventory  items  into  impact  categories,  which  provide  a  more  useful  and  manageable  set  of  data. 
This  process  is  accomplished  through  the  two  discrete  activities  of  the  classification  phase: 

•  using  existing  or  developing  new  impact  networks  to  identify  possible  impacts 
associated  with  specific  inventory  items,  and 

•  classifying  inventory  items  within  appropriate  impact  categories. 

3.1.1  Developing  Impact  Networks 

The  preliminary  activity  of  the  classification  phase  of  impact  assessment  is  to 
qualitatively  associate,  or  link,  inventory  items  with  subsequent  impacts.  This  qualitative  link 
can  be  established  by  reviewing  each  inventory  item  in  the  literature  to  determine  its  associated 
environmental  impact(s).  Further  review  of  the  literature  can  identify  additional  impacts  that  are 
associated  with  the  initial  impact.  For  example,  consider  that  a  quantity  of  SO2  emissions 
released  into  the  atmosphere  is  an  item  specified  in  the  inventory  analysis.  A  review  of  the 
impact  assessment  literature  might  identify  the  theory  that  SO2  released  into  the  atmosphere  can 
lead  to  the  formation  of  acid  precipitation.  Acid  precipitation,  in  turn,  can  be  found  to  lead  to  a 
number  of  additional  impacts,  such  as  the  destruction  of  high-altitude  forests,  acidification  of 
water  bodies,  corrosion  of  buildings  and  materials,  and  leaching  of  metals  from  soils.  Further 
search  of  the  impact  assessment  literature  may  reveal  that  these  impacts  can  induce  other 
identifiable  impacts  and  so  on.

Associating,  or  linking,  inventory  items  to  their  respective  impacts  is  a  key  issue  of 
impact  assessment  because  the  pathways  linking  inventory  items  to  their  impacts  typically  are 
complex  and  nonlinear.  Practitioners  can  use  existing  or  develop  new  impact  networks  to  aid  in 
mapping  out  impact  pathways.  Networks  of  potential  impacts  are  conceptual  diagrams  that 
illustrate  qualitative  links  between  inventory  items  and  potential  impacts.  As  the  use  of  the  term 
“qualitative  links”  implies,  these  networks  do  not  necessarily  provide  a  description  of  actual 
impacts.  Instead,  networks  provide  a  means  of  identifying  all  the  various  potential  impacts  that 
can  be  associated  with  inventory  items. 

Consider  the  case  of  a  given  quantity  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  identified  in  the  inventory 
analysis.  A  search  of  the  literature  reveals  that  CO2  is  often  linked  to  the  greenhouse  effect, 
which  is  a  buildup  of  CO2  and  other  gases  that  are  relatively  transparent  to  sunlight  but  trap  heat 
by  more  efficiently  absorbing  the  longer  wave  infrared  radiation  released  by  the  earth  (Schneider, 
1990).  In  turn,  an  enhanced  greenhouse  effect  is  linked  to  other  impacts  such  as  global  warming, 
which  in  turn  is  linked  to  regional  climate  change.  This  example,  as  well  as  the  basic  framework 
for  building  an  impact  network,  is  illustrated  in  Figure  3-3. 

Developing  impact  networks  can  be  a  difficult  task.  Pathways  from  inventory  items  to 
impacts  may  not  yet  be  fully  identified  and  many  factors  govern  how  and  what  kind  of  impacts 
will  result.  Because  many  pathways  and  impacts  can  exist,  tracing  impact  networks  through  a 
number  of  different  pathways  may  be  necessary.^ 

As  an  example  of  a  multiple  pathway  impact  network,  consider  the  case  of  nitrogen 
oxides  released  from  a  coal-fired  electric  plant,  as  shown  in  Figure  3-4.  In  other 
situations,  multiple  inventory  items  can  lead  to  a  similar  impact  or  impacts.  As  an  example  of 
such  a  scenario,  consider  the  greenhouse  effect. 


Figure  3-3.  Example  of  Basic  Network  Using  CO2 


Tn  this  report  we  do  not  use  the  terms  primary,  secondary,  or  tertiary  to  distinguish  impact  levels  because  of  the 
implicit  valuation  imbedded  in  those  terms  and  the  difficulty  of  assigning  the  terms  to  a  complex  web  of 
impacts  typical  of  many  impact  networks. 


3-5 


Figure  3-4.  NO^  Example  of  Multiple  Pathway  Impact  Network  from  a 

Single  Inventory  Item 


Like  many  other  impacts,  a  number  of  different  substances  may  contribute  to  the 
greenhouse  effect,  as  demonstrated  in  Figure  3-5. 

In  summary,  linking  inventory  items  to  impacts  can  take  a  variety  of  forms.  The  linkage 
can  range  from  a  simple  linear  one  (as  shown  in  Figure  3-3)  to  one  that  involves  linear  and 
nonlinear  relationships  between  multiple  inventory  items  and  multiple  impacts  (as  shown  in 
Figures  3-4  and  3-5).  It  is  expected  that  a  “library”  of  networks  will  be  developed  through  the 
practice  of  impact  assessment,  making  such  assessments  increasingly  more  feasible  and 
economical. 


3-6 


Figure  3-5.  Example  of  Multiple  Inventory  Items  Leading  to  Similar  Impacts 


3.1.2  Classifying  Inventory  Items  Within  Impact  Categories 

After  referring  to  existing  impact  networks  or  developing  new  ones,  practitioners  should 
review  the  networks  to  see  if  they  contain  any  inherent  structure  that  enables  them  to  establish  a 
set  of  impact  categories  under  which  inventory  items  can  be  grouped.  For  example,  during  the 
review  of  impact  networks,  researchers  might  identify  that  quantities  of  air  emissions  listed  in 
the  inventory  analysis,  such  as  CO2,  methane  (CH4),  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs),  and  ozone 
(O3),  all  contribute  to  the  greenhouse  effect.  All  four  of  these  inventory  items  thus  can  be 
grouped  in  the  subcategory,  greenhouse  effect,  within  the  main  ecosystem  impacts  category. 

The  three  main  categories  of  impacts  considered  in  an  impact  assessment  include  impacts 
to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and  natural  resources.  Social  welfare  may  be  considered  as  an 
additional  impact  category,  although  currently  no  tools  yield  a  credible  analysis  of  such  impacts. 


3-7 


Despite  the  current  lack  of  tools  to  analyze  social  welfare  impacts,  practitioners  can  attempt  to 
incorporate  social  welfare  impacts  by 

•  identifying  the  impacts  of  a  product  or  process  life  cycle  on  social  welfare,  and 

•  identifying  the  effect  of  social  welfare  impacts  on  ecosystems,  human  health,  or  natural 
resources. 

As  an  example  of  a  social  welfare  impact,  consider  the  large  labor  force  required  to 
manufacture  automobiles.  The  immigration  of  a  large  labor  force  into  the  area  may  result  in 
impacts  such  as  overcrowding  and  degradation  of  pristine  habitat  in  nearby  recreation  areas. 

Figure  3-6  provides  a  generic  example  of  possible  impact  categories  and  subcategories  as 
developed  from  a  hypothetical  set  of  impact  networks.  The  suggested  approach  to  classification 
is  to  first  build  impact  networks  and  see  if  they  contain  any  inherent  structure  for  developing 
subcategories  of  impacts  rather  than  starting  with  a  prestructured,  and  value-laden,  list  of  impact 
subcategories.  This  approach  to  classification  is  essentially  the  same  as  that  used  by  SET  AC 
(1993),  which  groups  inventory  items  into  relatively  homogeneous  problem  types,  called  stressor 
categories.  Our  approach  differs  only  in  that  the  term  “stressor”  is  not  used  because  of  ongoing 
confusion  associated  with  the  use  of  that  term. 

3.1.3  Example  Classification  Exercise  of  High-Density  Polyethylene  (HDPE)  Production 

An  inventory  analysis  of  an  HDPE  production  system  would  likely  include  numerous 
components.  Table  3-1  provides  examples  of  information  developed  in  an  inventory  analysis  for 
the  manufacture  of  HDPE. 

Ecosystem,  human  health,  and  natural  resource  impacts  associated  with  the  items  listed  in 
Table  3-1  can  be  determined  by  searching  the  impact  assessment  literature.  For  example,  the 
release  of  SO2  from  the  manufacture  of  HDPE,  as  shown  in  Table  3-1,  can  be  evaluated  for 
potential  impacts  by  searching  the  literature  for  the  effects  of  SO2  released  into  the  atmosphere. 
From  this  search,  it  will  likely  be  determined  that  SO2  emissions  to  the  atmosphere  often 
combine  with  other  atmospheric  compounds  to  produce  acid  precipitation.  Thus,  as  shown  in 
Table  3-2,  SO2  can  be  categorized  under  the  ecosystem  impact  category  of  acidification.

3.2  CHARACTERIZATION 

Although  classification  can  provide  useful  information  for  reviewing  the  types  of 
impacts  associated  with  specific  inventory  items,  further  analysis  may  be  desired  to  adequately 
describe  those  impacts.  The  characterization  phase  aims  to  describe  and  estimate  the 
contribution  of  inventory  items  to  environmental  impacts  via  the  use  of  specific  impact 
assessment  tools  or  characterization  models.  The  intended  output  of  the  characterization  phase  is 
a  set  of  impact  descriptors,  which  include  data  points  or  other  information  that  describes  the 
relationship  between  specific  inventory  items  and  impacts.

The  complete  characterization  phase,  as  defined  in  this  document,  includes  three  separate 
but  complementary  activities: 

•  determining  assessment  endpoints, 

•  selecting  measurement  endpoints  (if  necessary),  and 

•  applying  characterization  models  to  develop  impact  descriptors. 

3.2.1  Determining  Assessment  Endpoints 

After  identifying  the  impacts  associated  with  inventory  items  and  grouping  them  into 
impact  categories  in  the  classification  stage,  the  practitioner  should  review  the  previously 


3-10 


established  goals  and  scope,  and  other  key  decision  points,  of  the  overall  LCA  to  identify  which 
of  the  impacts  are  within  the  scope  of  the  study,  which  are  referred  to  as  the  assessment 
endpoints.  These  endpoints  represent  the  focus  of  the  characterization  efforts.

Because  LCAs  are  restricted  by  their  goals  and  scope,  many  of  the  impacts  identified  may 
not  be  included  in  the  LCA.  The  only  “correct”  set  of  impacts,  or  assessment  endpoints,  is  that 
which  satisfies  the  specific  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA  at  hand.  Because  no  single  “correct”  or 
minimum  set  of  assessment  endpoints  should  be  included  in  an  impact  assessment,  practitioners 
should  make  clear,  and  possibly  qualify,  the  exclusion  of  any  impacts  as  assessment  endpoints. 


3-11 


For  example,  SO2  emissions  quantified  in  the  inventory  analysis  can  be  associated  with  acid 
precipitation,  which  in  turn  can  lead  to  a  number  of  further  impacts  as  identified  in  the 
classification  stage,  including  the  destruction  of  high-altitude  forests,  acidification  of  water 
bodies,  corrosion  of  buildings  and  materials,  and  leaching  of  metals  from  soils.  The  practitioner 
might  determine  that,  for  example,  acidification  of  waterbodies  is  the  most  pertinent  impact 
based  on  the  key  LCA  decision  points;  thus  acidification  of  waterbodies  will  be  considered  an 
assessment  endpoint. 

Determining  assessment  endpoints  from  a  potentially  large  number  and  variety  of  impacts 
is  by  no  means  a  straightforward  exercise.  The  key  LCA  decision  points  must  continually  be 
reviewed,  possibly  in  coordination  with  defined  criteria  for  guiding  the  determination  of 
assessment  endpoints.  Table  3-3  outlines  some  suggested  criteria  for  determining  assessment 
endpoints.  Practitioners  should  select  assessment  endpoints  that  provide  useful  information  for 
characterizing  potential  impacts.  The  assessment  endpoints  should  be  selected  in  an  unbiased, 
scientifically  objective  manner  to  help  ensure  that  results  of  the  LCA  are  unbias  and  credible. 

3.2.2  Selecting  Measurement  Endpoints 

If  the  assessment  endpoint  is  not  directly  measurable,  then  the  practitioner  may  opt  to 
select  a  measurement  endpoint  as  a  surrogate  for  the  assessment  endpoint.  A  measurement 
endpoint  is  a  measurable  characteristic  of  an  impact  that  can  be  related  to  a  specific  assessment 
endpoint  (EPA,  1992b).  When  selecting  measurement  endpoints  there  may  be  properties  of  a 
specific  inventory  item,  or  group  of  inventory  items,  for  which  a  surrogate  measure  (i.e., 
measurement  endpoint)  of  potential  impact  can  be  used.  For  example,  the  acid  deposition 
potential  of  a  given  amount  of  SO2  emissions  can  be  used  as  a  surrogate  to  link  that  quantity  of 
SO2  emissions  to  impacts  such  as  leaching  of  metals  from  soils,  tree  damage,  or  fish  mortality.  If 
the  assessment  endpoint  is  directly  measurable,  then  it  can  be  used  as  a  measurement  endpoint. 

Because  a  number  of  possible  measurement  endpoints  may  be  available,  practitioners 
need  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  and  useful  endpoint  before  beginning  the  characterization 
phase  of  an  impact  assessment.  Using  the  key  LCA  decision  points  as  a  guide  or  a  set  of 
selection  criteria  may  be  helpful  when  choosing  measurement  endpoints.  Some  possible  criteria 
for  selecting  measurement  endpoints  that  are  specific  to  impact  assessment  include  the  following: 

•  the  relevance  of  the  measurement  endpoint  to  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA, 


3-12 


TABLE  3-3.  SUGGESTED  CRITERIA  FOR  DETERMINING  ASSESSMENT 

ENDPOINTS 


Criteria 

Description 

Study  goals 

Good  communication  between  the  analyst  and  the  decisionmaker(s)  is 
important  to  ensure  that  the  chosen  assessment  endpoints  appropriately  meet 
and  complement  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  study. 

Study  scope 

Scoping  helps  to  ensure  that  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  study  are  met. 

The  scope  of  the  study  defines  not  only  the  spatial  and  temporal  boundaries 
of  potential  impacts  considered  but  also  defines  such  factors  as  the  intended 
end  use  or  application  of  the  impact  assessment  results.  If  the  scope  of  the 
study  is  defined  to  consider  site-specific  impacts  of  deforestation,  then  site- 
specific  impacts  would  constitute  appropriate  assessment  endpoints. 

Magnitude  of 

environmental 

loading 

The  magnitude  of  environmental  loadings  as  quantified  in  the  inventory 
analysis  could  be  used  to  further  delimit  areas  to  focus  more  detailed  levels 
of  impact  assessment.  However,  it  would  be  redundant  to  use  the  magnitude 
of  environmental  loadings  as  a  decision  point  for  more  simplistic  impact 
assessment  methods  (e.g.,  less  is  better,  relative  magnitude). 

Environmental 

relevance 

Environmentally  relevant  assessment  endpoints  reflect  important 
characteristics  of  the  natural  environmental  system  and  are  functionally 
related  to  other  possible  endpoints.  Changes  at  higher  levels  of  organization 
may  be  of  greater  significance  because  of  their  potential  for  causing  major 
impacts  at  lower  levels  of  organization. 

Level 

The  most  appropriate  assessment  endpoint  is  the  earliest  impact  (i.e.,  nearest 
in  time  to  the  release  of  an  inventory  item  to  the  environment)  that  allows 
one  to  distinguish  between  alternative  impacts  or  alternative  systems.  This 
criterion  is  most  applicable  to  comparative  studies. 

Stakeholder  values 

Stakeholder  (including  societal)  values  can  range  from  protection  of 
endangered  species  to  preservation  of  environmental  attributes  for  functional 
reasons  (e.g.,  flood  water  retention  by  wetlands)  or  aesthetic  reasons  (e.g., 
visibility  in  the  Grand  Canyon). 

Data  availability 

Data  availability  is  a  limiting  factor  that  cuts  across  all  fields  of  research.  In 
some  cases,  data  may  be  more  readily  available  for  one  assessment  endpoint 
than  another,  thus  making  it  a  more  attractive  candidate.  However,  the 
convenience  of  readily  available  data  should  not  be  in  lieu  of  quality.  The 
quality  of  the  available  data  should  be  evaluated  against  previously 
developed  data  quality  goals.

•  the  consistency  of  an  endpoint  with  the  scope  and  boundaries  of  the  inventory  analysis, 

•  the  intended  application  or  end  use  of  the  impact  assessment  results, 

•  data  limitations, 

•  the  availability  of  impact  assessment  models,  and 

•  the  ease  of  characterizing  potential  impacts  (i.e.,  direct  versus  indirect  impacts). 

Ideally,  the  characterization  phase  will  quantify  the  relationship  between  an  inventory 
item  and  an  assessment  endpoint.  When  an  assessment  endpoint  can  be  directly  measured,  this 
process  can  be  relatively  straightforward.  When  it  cannot  be  measured,  the  practitioner  must 
establish  the  relationship  between  the  inventory  item  and  a  chosen  measurement  endpoint.  The 
practitioner  might  also  use  additional  extrapolations,  analyses,  and  assumptions  to  predict  or 
infer  changes  in  the  assessment  endpoint.  It  is  critical  to  make  these  methods  and  assumptions 
clear  in  the  final  impact  assessment  results. 

3.2.3  Applying  Characterization  Models  to  Develop  Impact  Descriptors 

The  ability  to  characterize  measurement  endpoints  hinges  on  the  availability  and  use  of 
specific  impact  assessment  tools,  called  characterization  models,  to  describe  the  contribution  of 
specific  inventory  items  to  impacts.  The  preliminary  framework  for  this  characterization  activity 
is  contained  in  a  five-tiered  hierarchy  of  characterization  models,  as  described  in  Table  3-4. 

This  five-tiered  hierarchy  is  based  on  discussions  from  the  February  1992  SET  AC  Life-Cycle 
Impact  Analysis  Workshop  (see  SET  AC,  1993)  and  the  October  1992  SET  AC  Life-Cycle  Data 
Quality  Workshop. 

A  primary  concern  of  this  characterization  activity  is  the  lack  of  available  data  for 
conducting  many  levels  of  assessment.  At  present,  data  requirements  generally  increase  and  data 
availability  generally  decreases  moving  from  Tier  1-  to  Tier  5-type  assessments.  A  recent 
SET  AC-sponsored  LCA  Data  Quality  Workshop  in  Wintergreen,  Virginia,  recognized  that 
currently  available  environmental  input  and  output  data  can  only  support  some  Tier  2-  to 
Tier  3-type  models.  As  shown  in  Table  3-4,  advancing  to  Tier  2-  and  3-type  assessments 
requires  equivalency  factors  and  chemical-properties  (i.e.,  toxicity,  persistence,  and 
bioaccumulation)  data.  Proceeding  to  Tier  4-  and  Tier  5-type  models  requires  high  quality, 
process-specific,  unaggregated,  and  unaveraged  inventory  data.  Data  produced  from  the 
inventory  analysis  are  currently  unable  to  support  most  Tier  4-  and  Tier  5-type  assessments. 
Developing  a  publicly  available  database  specifically  designed  for  use  in  LCA  to  serve  as  a 


3-14 


clearinghouse  for  generic  information  supporting  LCAs  as  well  as  for  other  types  of  residuals- 
based  analyses  is  a  high-priority  item  within  the  LCA  community. 


TABLE  3-4.  CHARACTERIZATION  MODELS:  TIERS  OF  COMPLEXITY  AND 

ASSOCIATED  DATA  NEEDS 


Tier 

Description 

Data  Needs 

Tier  1:  Loading 
Assessment 

Inventory  data  alone  are  used  to  evaluate 
on  the  basis  of  quantity  or  volume  with 
the  assumption  that  “less  is  better.” 

Mass,  volume,  or  other  units  of 
physical  quantity  of  inventory  items. 

Tier  2:  Equivalency 
Assessment 

Algorithms  based  on  hazard  information 
are  used  to  derive  impact  equivalency 
units  to  evaluate  inventory  items  within  a 
specific  impact  category. 

Same  as  Tier  1 ,  plus  algorithms  for 
equivalency  conversions.  Also  can 
include  resource  stock  and  yield,  and 
non-chemical  loading  information. 

Tier  3:  Toxicity, 
Persistence,  and 
Bioaccumulation 
Assessment 

Interactive  properties  between  a  chemical 
and  an  organism  (toxicity)  and  an 
ecosystem  (persistence  and 
bioaccumulation)  are  used  to  evaluate 
inventory  items. 

Same  as  Tier  1,  plus  information  on 
characteristics  of  chemical 
interactions  with  organisms  (toxicity) 
and  ecosystems  (persistence, 
bioaccumulation ) . 

Tier  4:  Generic 

Exposure/Effects 

Assessment 

Generic  environmental  or  human  health 
information  are  used  to  estimate  potential 
impacts  of  inventory  items. 

Same  as  Tier  1,  plus  generic 
environmental  information  and 
regional  calibration  model. 

Tier  5:  Site-Specific 

Exposure/Effects 

Assessment 

Site-specific  environmental  or  human 
health  information  is  used  to  estimate 
potential  impacts  of  inventory  items. 

Same  as  Tier  1 ,  plus  site-specific 
environmental  information  and  a  site- 
specific  calibration  model. 

Source:  SETAC,  1993 


Loading  Assessment 

Loading  assessment  is  based  on  the  premise  of  “less  is  better”  and  is  the  simplest  type  of 
characterization  method.  In  loading  assessment,  the  data  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis  are 
directly  used  to  identify  areas  where  impacts  can  be  reduced  through  reductions  in  inputs  and 
outputs.  Loading  assessment  does  not  assess — qualitatively  or  quantitatively — the  impacts  of 
those  inputs  and  outputs  or  the  benefits  of  their  reduction. 


3-15 


Equivalency  Assessment 

Equivalency  assessment  includes  approaches  that  translate  inventory  items  into  common 
units  (via  the  use  of  equivalency  factors)  of  impact  that  can  either  be  evaluated  to  compare  the 
individual  contributions  of  inventory  items  to  impacts  or  resulting  equivalency  units  to  assess  the 
collective  contribution  of  items  to  impacts.  Equivalency  factors  are  based  on  mechanisms  of 
impact  that  relate  groups  of  inventory  items  to  specific  impacts.  Equivalency  units  can  be 
aggregated  within  impact  categories  to  provide  an  estimate  of  the  total  level  of  impact.  This 
method  essentially  consists  of  multiplying  the  values  for  groups  of  inventory  items  (e.g., 
greenhouse  gases)  by  the  appropriate  equivalency  factors,  thus  expressing  the  inventory  items  in 
equivalency  units  (e.g.,  global  warming  potential). 

Toxicity,  Persistence,  and  Bioaccumulation  Assessment 

Toxicity,  persistence,  and  bioaccumulation  assessment  includes  those  approaches  that  are 
more  comprehensive  than  the  Tier  2  equivalency  assessment  approaches  because  they  take  into 
account  not  only  hazard  but  also  ecosystem  and  organism  exposure  information.  Specifically, 
these  models  often  focus  on  properties  such  as  toxicity  as  an  indicator  of  hazard  and  persistence 
and  bioaccumulation  as  indicators  of  exposure.  The  main  premise  of  these  models  is  to  use 
information  on  the  inherent  properties  of  substances  to  assess  the  potential  impacts  of  chemical 
substances  on  the  environment. 

Information  on  the  inherent  properties  of  many  chemical  substances  can  be  found  in  the 
literature  (e.g.,  environmental  fate  of  organic  chemicals  or  fate-and-tran sport  literature).  It  can 
also  be  predicted  using  computer  databases  (e.g..  Aquatic  Toxicity  Information  Retrieval, 
AQUIRE,  for  water)  and  models  (e.g..  Regional  Acidification  Information  and  Simulation, 
RAINS,  for  acid  precipitation). 

Generic  Exposure/Effects  Assessment 

Generic  exposure/effects  assessment  is  the  next  higher  level  of  complexity  that  includes 
approaches  that  use  generic  environmental  and  human  health  information  to  model  the  potential 
impacts  of  inventory  items  on  a  generic  level.  These  generic  approaches  typically  utilize 
computer-based  models  to  determine  the  fate,  transport,  and  partitioning  of  substances  released 
to  hypothetical,  computer-generated  “environments.”  The  computer-generated  environments 
contain  standardized  information  on  the  main  components  of  the  environment  (i.e.,  atmosphere, 
hydrosphere,  soil,  and  biota  [plants,  animals,  and  microorganisms]). 


3-16 


Site-Specific  Exposure/Effects  Assessment 

Site-specific  exposure/effects  assessment  approaches  utilize  general  to  site-specific 
environmental  and  human  health  information  to  provide  site-specific  information  on  potential 
impacts.  It  should  be  noted  that  use  of  detailed,  site-specific  information  should  only  be  needed 
in  cases  where  such  information  is  required  to  clarify  the  decision  to  be  made.  The  necessary 
time  and  resource  expense  of  conducting  site-specific  studies,  as  well  as  data  availability  limits, 
makes  their  applicability  to  most  impact  assessments  questionable  in  most  cases. 

The  use  of  site-specific  approaches  may  be  appropriate  for  some  LCAs.  However,  for 
many  LCAs,  site-specific  approaches  may  not  be  necessary  or  desirable. 

Central  to  the  characterization  phase  is  choosing  the  characterization  model  that  is  the 
appropriate  level  of  detail  to  complement  the  key  LCA  decision  points.  The  objective  at  this 
phase  is  to  match  the  available  data  and  resources  with  the  minimum  level  of  detail  needed  to 
distinguish  between  alternative  impacts  or  systems.  Using  models  that  provide  more  detailed 
information  is  only  beneficial  if  the  extra  effort  provides  useful  information  for  decisionmaking. 
If  data  or  resources  are  not  available  to  conduct  an  assessment  of  the  desired  level  of  detail,  then 
a  less  detailed  model  can  be  used  if  it  provides  useful  information.  If  the  less  detailed  tool  or 
model  does  not  provide  useful  information,  then  the  characterization  might  not  be  worthwhile. 

Figure  3-7  illustrates  the  decision  process  through  which  practitioners  choose  the 
characterization  model  of  appropriate  level  of  detail. 

3.2.4  Impact  Descriptors 

The  application  of  characterization  models  provides  an  initial  description  of  impact, 
called  impact  descriptors.  When  the  characterized  impact  is  both  the  measurement  and 
assessment  endpoint,  the  practitioner  may  be  able  to  proceed  to  the  valuation  phase  of  impact 
assessment  relatively  easily,  provided  the  practitioner  derived  the  appropriate  information  for 
satisfying  the  key  LCA  decision  points.  If  the  measurement  endpoint  is  used  as  a  surrogate 
measure  for  the  assessment  endpoint,  the  practitioner  may  need  to  relate  that  measurement 
endpoint  to  the  assessment  endpoint  in  some  manner.  One  problem  with  relating  measurement  to 
assessment  endpoints  is  that  the  specific  type  of  output  produced  is  not  yet  clear,  because  many 
models  have  not  been  applied  in  the  context  of  LCA.

3-18 


The  application  of  characterization  models  in  impact  assessment  achieves  some 
aggregation  of  the  inventory  analysis  and  impact  characterizations  stages  of  LCA,  resulting  in  a 
simpler  set  of  impact  descriptors  within  each  impact  category  (SETAC,  1993).  Impact 
descriptors  can  include  quantitative  (e.g.,  numerical  level  of  increase  in  local  tropospheric  ozone 
buildup)  and/or  qualitative  (e.g.,  descriptive  estimate  [high,  medium,  low]  of  threats  to  regional 
wildlife  populations)  information.  In  other  words,  impact  descriptors  can  quantitatively  or 
qualitatively  characterize  the  relationship  between  specific  inventory  items  and  specific  impact 
categories. 

3.3  VALUATION 

Once  a  set  of  impact  descriptors  has  been  developed  that  as  concisely  and  technically 
possible  characterizes  the  relevant  environmental  impacts  being  assessed,  the  explicit  application 
of  valuation  methods  is  appropriate  (SETAC,  1993).  The  valuation  phase  essentially  involves 
assigning  relative  values  or  weights  to  impacts  based  on  the  integration  of  stakeholder  values  and 
the  associated  impact  descriptors. 

The  main  objective  of  valuation  is  to  establish  the  relative  importance  (based  on 
stakeholder  values)  of  multiple  impacts  to  aid  in  the  LCA  user’s  decisionmaking  process. 
Therefore,  the  practitioner’s  primary  task  is  to  adequately  capture  and  express  to  decisionmakers 
the  full  range  of  potential  impacts  relevant  to  the  LCA,  without  overwhelming  his/her  audience 
with  information.  The  practitioner  should  express  these  impacts  so  that  determining  critical 
impact  areas  on  which  to  focus  further  research  and/or  improvement  efforts  is  understood. 

Although  widely  practiced,  implicitly  and  explicitly,  in  the  LCA  community,  the 
valuation  stage  is  the  least  developed  of  the  three  impact  assessment  stages.  In  general, 
valuation  includes  the  following  activities: 

•  identifying  the  underlying  values  of  stakeholders, 

•  determining  weights  to  place  on  impacts,  and 

•  applying  weights  to  impact  descriptors. 

Making  successful  decisions  based  on  impact  assessment  requires  considering  all 
assessment  results  and  technical  information.  In  addition,  decisions  are  not  solely  based  on  the 
precision  of  measurement  but  also  on  how  measurements  are  interpreted  in  terms  of  imprecisely 
understood  study  goals  and  stakeholder  values.  Although  developing  a  truly  objective  method 
for  valuation  may  be  both  impossible  and  inappropriate,  several  conceptual  and  methodological 
approaches  to  valuation  have  been  developed  (see  Chapter  6).

CHAPTER  4 

EXISTING  METHODS  FOR  CHARACTERIZING  IMPACTS 


This  chapter  provides  descriptions  of  various  types  of  methods  for  characterizing  impacts 
that  have  been  discussed,  presented,  or  used  in  the  context  of  LCA.  The  methods  described  in 
this  chapter  include  those  that  focus  on  impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and/or  natural 
resources.  Methods  that  have  specifically  been  designed  to  assess  resource  depletion  have 
historically  been  kept  separate  from  those  methods  to  assess  environmental  impacts  and  are 
described  in  Chapter  5.  Integrative  impact  assessment  methods  that  contain  a  combination  of 
classification,  characterization,  and/or  valuation  activities  are  presented  in  Chapter  7.  Methods 
evaluated  for  this  document  that  exhibit  potential  applicability  to  impact  assessment  but  which 
have  not  been  discussed,  presented,  or  used  in  an  LCA  context  are  described  in  Appendix  B. 

Although  the  methods  included  in  this  chapter  span  the  three  main  impact  categories  (i.e., 
ecosystem,  human  health,  and  natural  resources)  used  in  impact  assessment,  some  of  the  methods 
are  clearly  more  appropriate  for  assessing  specific  impact  categories  and  will  be  identified  as 
such.  Also,  because  some  methods  in  this  chapter  do  not  fit  nicely  in  the  generally  established 
five-tier  hierarchy  of  detail  for  impact  characterization,  as  discussed  in  Chapter  3,  they  have  not 
been  grouped  and/or  presented  by  tier  of  analysis.  The  methods  however,  are  presented  in  the 
order  of  increasing  level  of  detail  (i.e.,  from  Tier  1  to  Tier  5).  Table  4-1  provides  summary 
information  on  each  of  the  methods  profiled  in  this  chapter. 

4.1  CHECKLIST  APPROACH 

Inventory  analysis  provides  a  quantified  listing  of  inputs  and  outputs  at  various  stages  of 
the  life  cycle  for  a  defined  product  system.  The  data  generated  in  inventory  analysis  typically  are 
provided  for  the  weight  or  volume  of  input  or  output  (per  unit  of  production  or  time)  either  by 
life-cycle  stage  or  by  total  for  the  entire  life  cycle.  Such  data  alone  can  be  used  directly  to 
identify  stages  in  the  life  cycle  where  outputs  can  be  decreased.  However,  the  checklist  approach 
merely  compares  the  data  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis  and  does  not  measure  impacts. 
More  detailed  levels  of  impact  assessment  may  be  required  to  distinguish  the  relative 
environmental  importance  of  various  inventory  items.  Another  use  of  loading  data  is  to  compare 
the  overall  output  levels  between  alternative  products  or  production  systems.

The  checklist  approach  is  basically  a  classification  matrix  that  can  be  used  to  correlate 
specific  inventory  items  with  specific  impacts  or  impact  categories.  The  checklist  allows  for  the 
information  developed  in  the  inventory  analysis  to  be  organized  in  a  meaningful  way  to  provide  a 
quick  overview  of  qualitative  impact  information.  As  shown  in  Table  4-2,  the  checklist  is 
arranged  so  that  the  presence  or  absence  of  specific  impacts  can  be  clearly  shown. 

Strengths 

The  main  strength  of  the  checklist  approach  is  its  simplicity.  Inventory  data  alone  can  be 
used  directly  without  modification,  and  a  simplified  view  of  cause/effect  relationships  is 
provided  by  qualitatively  associating  impacts  and  inputs  and  outputs.

In  addition  to  convenience  and  ease,  other  strengths  of  the  checklist  approach  include  the 
following: 


4-3 


•  identifying  areas  for  reducing  environmental  inputs  and/or  outputs,  and 

•  comparing  levels  of  inputs  and/or  outputs  between  alternative  materials,  processes,  or 
products. 

Weaknesses 

Although  simplicity  is  the  chief  strength  of  the  checklist  approach,  it  is  also  its  main 
weakness.  It  is  critical  to  recognize  that  the  checklist  approach  does  not  actually  assess  the 
occurrence  of  potential  impacts  or  their  relative  magnitudes. 

Some  additional  weaknesses  of  the  checklist  approach  include  the  following: 

•  choices  for  environmental  improvement  are  difficult  to  justify  or  defend  scientifically, 

•  improvements  in  environmental  conditions  may  not  be  achieved  because  potential 
impacts  are  not  assessed, 

•  resources  may  be  wasted  on  improvement  actions  that  were  not  part  of  the  real 
environmental  issues,  and 

•  opportunities  for  environmental  improvements  may  have  been  missed  (SET AC,  1993). 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  checklist  approach  alone  can  be  used  to  identify  stages  in  the  life  cycle  where  outputs 
can  be  decreased.  The  checklist  provides  a  tool  to  evaluate  the  data  generated  in  the  inventory 
analysis.  However,  the  checklist  approach  does  not  measure  impacts.  More  detailed  levels  of 
impact  assessment  may  be  required  to  distinguish  the  relative  environmental  importance  of 
various  inventory  items.  Use  of  the  checklist  approach  would  be  more  appropriate  for  internal 
applications  until  guidelines  are  established  for  the  external  use  of  such  techniques. 

Another  use  of  the  checklist  approach  is  to  quickly  and  easily  compare  the  overall  input 
and  output  levels  between  alternative  products  or  production  systems.  Such  “quick  and  dirty” 
comparisons  may  not  only  help  identify  some  key  differences  between  alternatives  but  also  help 
pinpoint  areas  to  focus  more  detailed  level  of  analyses. 

4.2  RELATIVE  MAGNITUDE  APPROACH 

The  relative  magnitude  approach  is  another  form  of  loading  assessment  in  which  the 
input  and  output  data  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis  are  associated  with  specific  impact 
categories.  Within  the  specific  impact  categories,  inventory  items  are  further  grouped  into 


4-4 


subranges  based  on  the  level  (quantity  or  volume)  of  inputs  or  outputs,  thus  indicating  the 
relative  contribution  of  various  inventory  items  to  specific  impacts. 

When  using  the  relative  magnitude  approach,  the  assigned  subrange  values  may  be  either 
subjectively  or  objectively  based.  Subjectively  based  subranges  could  use  a  scoring  range  of  1  to 
10  for  example,  where  the  inventory  items  with  the  lowest  quantity  would  receive  a  score  of  1, 
and  the  inventory  items  with  the  highest  quantity  would  receive  a  score  of  10.  Quantities  in 
between  these  two  bounds  can  then  be  extrapolated.  Objectively  based  subranges  would  use  data 
from  the  inventory  analysis  directly  (i.e.,  the  actual  quantities)  as  subrange  values. 

A  hypothetical  illustration  of  the  type  of  output  derived  from  the  use  of  the  relative 
magnitude  approach  is  shown  in  Table  4-3.  Although  Table  4-3  focuses  only  on  impacts  to 
ecosystems,  it  can  also  be  used  to  assess  impacts  to  human  health  and  natural  resources.

Strengths 

The  relative  magnitude  approach  is  relatively  easy  to  use;  it  is  based  on  cause/effect 
linkages  and  takes  into  account  the  relative  quantities  of  inventory  items.  In  addition,  the  relative 
magnitude  approach  can  be  helpful  for 

•  identifying  areas  for  reducing  environmental  inputs  and/or  outputs,  and 

•  comparing  levels  of  inputs  and/or  outputs  between  alternative  materials,  processes,  or 
products. 

Weaknesses 

The  primary  drawback  of  the  relative  magnitude  approach  is  its  limited  capability  for 
comparing  different  subranges.  In  addition,  as  with  many  other  loading  assessment  approaches, 
the  significance  of  impacts  may  be  misrepresented  because  impacts  are  not  measured  directly. 

Some  additional  weaknesses  of  the  relative  magnitude  approach  include  the  following: 

•  choices  for  environmental  improvement  are  difficult  to  justify  or  defend  scientifically, 

•  improvements  in  environmental  conditions  may  not  be  achieved  because  potential 
impacts  are  not  assessed, 

•  resources  may  be  wasted  on  improvement  actions  that  were  not  part  of  the  real 
environmental  issues,  and 

•  opportunities  for  environmental  improvements  may  have  been  missed  (SET AC,  1993). 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  relative  magnitude  approach  can  provide  a  useful  screening  tool  in  impact 
assessment  to  quickly  evaluate  the  inventory  items  and  impacts  that  are  most  significant  to  the 
LCA.  It  may  prove  particularly  useful  for  screening  large  numbers  of  inventory  items  and 
impacts.  Similar  to  the  checklist  approach,  however,  the  relative  magnitude  approach  merely  is  a 
tool  to  evaluate  data  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis  and  does  not  provide  measures  of 
impact.  Thus  it  is  more  appropriate  to  use  this  approach  for  internal  rather  than  external 
application  or  possibly  as  a  screening  tool  to  pinpoint  areas  where  a  more  detailed  level  of 
analysis  is  needed. 

4.3  ENVIRONMENTAL  STANDARDS  RELATION  (ESR) 

The  ESR  method  is  a  weighting  scheme  originally  developed  by  Schaltegger  and  Sturm 
(1993)  to  evaluate  the  environmental  impacts  of  chemical  releases  in  Switzerland.  The  purpose 


4-6 


of  ESR  is  to  assess  chemical  releases  to  air,  land,  and  water  based  on  their  relative  potential 
ecological  and  human  impact.  The  information  produced  from  applying  ESR  can  be  used  to 
evaluate  and  compare  the  relative  environmental  impacts  of  alternative  products  and  process  or 
alternative  industries.  ESR  can  also  be  applied  to  a  single  process,  a  collection  of  processes,  or 
entire  systems.  Although  the  use  of  ESR  provides  a  consistent  estimate  of  the  environmental 
impacts,  it  does  not  necessarily  preclude  the  need  for  additional  analyses. 

The  approach  for  developing  the  weights  used  in  ESR  is  shown  in  Table  4-4.  First,  the 
approach  identifies  ambient  standards  (i.e.,  target  concentrations)  established  by  regulatory 
agencies  for  chemical  levels  in  air,  land,  and  water  that  are  meant  to  protect  ecosystems  and 
human  health.  Second,  the  relationships  between  the  standards  were  made  explicit  by  converting 
the  ambient  standard  concentration  for  each  substance  in  each  medium  into  milligrams  per  mole. 
This  results  in  substance-  and  media-specific  standards  that  are  directly  comparable.  The  final 
step  consists  of  identifying  the  largest  value  in  all  media  (in  this  case  substance  B,  water 
standard)  and  then  dividing  that  value  by  all  other  values  to  derive  the  individual  weighting 
factors.  This  results  in  substance-  and  media-specific  weighting  factors  that  are  relative  to  every 
other  chemical  in  each  medium. 

The  weighting  factors  have  the  dimension  of  pollution  units  per  kilogram  (PU/kg)  of 
substance.  The  environmental  impact  of  a  specific  chemical  release  is  thus  calculated  by 
multiplying  the  quantity  of  the  released  substance  by  its  associated  substance-  and  media-specific 
weighting  factor.  The  equation  for  calculating  pollution  units  is  as  follows: 


Pollution  Units  (PU)  =  Chemical  Emission  x  Chemical-  and  Media-Specific 

Weighting  Factors 

Developing  an  ESR  weighting  scheme  for  the  U.S.  will  not  be  as  straightforward  as  it 
was  for  Switzerland  because  regulatory  standards  are  much  more  complex  in  the  U.S.  Ideally, 
regulatory  defined  and  objectively  tested  ambient  standards  would  be  available  for  all  chemical 
releases  of  interest  to  all  environmental  media.  However,  this  ideal  situation  does  not  exist. 
First,  many  possible  regulatory  standards  are  available  in  the  U.S.  for  air  and  water.  Second, 
many  of  these  standards  are  available  for  only  a  few  chemicals  under  one  regulatory  framework 
(e.g..  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards,  NAAQS,  applies  to  only  six  chemicals). 


4-7 


Therefore  establishing  a  decision  rule  for  prioritizing  the  standards  that  should  be  used  in  the 
weighting  scheme  is  necessary.

One  component  of  the  decision  rule  is  to  attempt  to  develop  a  weighting  scheme  using 
standards  that  were  developed  using  a  consistent  approach  that  is  protective  of  ecosystems  and 
human  health  and  welfare  so  that  the  weighting  factors  for  each  medium  are  comparable.  For 
example,  if  air  standards  are  designed  to  protect  the  atmosphere  and  human  health,  but  water 
standards  are  designed  only  to  protect  aquatic  organisms,  then  the  comparison  of  pollution  units 
for  each  medium  is  less  meaningful.  It  is  possible  that  the  water  standards  would  not  protect 
human  health;  therefore,  the  water  factors  would  underestimate  the  potential  impacts. 


4-8 


Strengths 

Some  of  the  advantages  of  the  ESR  weighting  scheme  include  the  following: 

•  ambient  regulatory  standards  represent  social,  political,  regulatory,  and  scientific 
opinions  and  values; 

•  weighting  factors  used  in  ESR  consider  human  health  and  ecological  welfare; 

•  weighting  factors  can  be  derived  for  all  substances  that  have  ambient  regulatory 
standards  and/or  regulatory  values; 

•  ESR  weighting  scheme  represents  the  relative  impacts  of  different  chemical  releases  to 
different  environmental  media;  and 

•  ESR  approach  is  flexible  and  can  incorporate  state,  regional,  and  local  regulations  for 
location  specific  assessments. 

Weaknesses 

Scientific  information  on  toxicity  and  environmental  health  effects  are  generally 
considered  in  establishing  ambient  standards.  However,  the  ESR  weighting  scheme’s  use  of 
relations  between  ambient  standards  is  not  a  thoroughly  scientific  or  ecotoxicological-based 
scheme  but  instead  represents  a  socio-cultural  judgment  from  an  ecological  perspective  (which 
relies  on  ecotoxicological  data).  No  completely  objective  and  undoubtedly  valid  opinion  on  the 
harmfulness  of  substances  exists  because  of  uncertainties  in  data.  Weights  for  specific  pollutants 
are  developed  in  the  ESR  method  according  to  generally  accepted  norms  and  values,  which  are 
theoretically  expressed  in  ambient  concentration  standards.  Such  ambient  standards  may  or  may 
not  reflect  actual  environmental  impacts. 

In  addition,  the  ESR  weighting  scheme  only  considers  chemical  releases.  There  is  no 
way  to  account  for  the  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  raw  materials  use,  energy 
consumption,  and  nonchemical  stresses  (e.g.,  noise,  heat).  It  is  also  critical  to  recognize  that  the 
number  of  pollution  units  derived  in  the  ESR  weighting  scheme  represents  only  one  dimension 
of  the  overall  environmental  impact,  namely  those  resulting  from  pollutant  releases.  For 
example,  the  alteration  of  pristine  habitat,  the  erosion  of  fertile  top  soil,  and  similar  impacts 
represent  a  devaluation  of  environmental  assets  that  is  not  captured  by  the  pollution  units. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  information  produced  from  applying  the  ESR  can  be  used  in  impact  assessment  to 
evaluate  and  compare  the  relative  environmental  impacts  of  inventory  items  where  regulatory 


4-9 


standards  exist.  Preliminary  work  is  being  performed  to  develop  pollutant  weighting  factors 
based  on  U.S.  regulatory  standards.  The  use  of  guidelines  and  reference  concentrations,  which 
are  not  regulatory  standards,  may  also  prove  to  be  useful  for  the  type  of  analysis.  Especially  if 
these  reference  levels  are  more  strongly  based  on  health  and  environmental  effects  rather  than 
technical  or  economic  concerns.  For  example,  EPA  inhalation  reference  concentrations  (RfCs) 
and  Maximum  Contaminant  Level  Goals  (MCLGs).  Although  the  use  of  ESR  provides  a 
consistent  estimate  of  the  environmental  impacts,  it  does  not  necessarily  preclude  the  need  for 
additional  analyses. 

4.4  IMPACT  POTENTIALS 

For  some  categories  of  impacts,  it  is  currently  feasible  to  use  algorithms  to  estimate  the 
impact  potential  of  various  inventory  items.  These  impact  potential  algorithms  provide  a  means 
of  converting  different  types  of  data  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis  into  a  common  unit  for 
comparison  and/or  aggregation  within  impact  categories.  For  example,  algorithms  for 
normalizing  the  contribution  of  substances  to  impact  categories  such  as  the  greenhouse  effect 
have  been  developed  to  yield  the  global  warming  potential  of  various  substances.  Aggregating 
theses  global  warming  potentials  yields  a  sum  figure  that  can  then  be  used  to  assess  the  collective 
contribution  of  greenhouse  gases  to  global  warming  or  the  contribution  of  individual  greenhouse 
gases  to  global  warming. 

The  formula  shown  below  illustrates  the  generic  method  for  deriving  impact  equivalency 

units: 


Inventory  Data  x  Equivalency  Factor  =  Impact  Potential 


The  inventory  data  are  multiplied  by  an  equivalency  factor  to  yield  an  impact  potential  value. 
Once  calculated,  the  impact  potential  values  can  be  aggregated  within  their  respective  impact 
categories  to  assess  their  collective  contribution  to  the  impact  category  or  they  can  be  assessed 
individually.  Table  4-5  describes  the  state-of-the-art  impact  potential  functions  that  are  available 
for  characterizing  specific  impact  categories. 

A  major  concern  of  impact  potentials  is  developing  equivalency  factors  for  all  impact 
categories  that  relate  inventory  data  to  specific  impacts.  While  it  is  generally  agreed  that 
equivalency  factors  should  be  based  on  impact  mechanisms  directly  related  to  the  impact 


4-10 


categories,  it  is  unclear  at  this  time  how  equivalency  factors  would  be  developed  for  all 
categories  of  impacts. 

Impact  Potential  Example:  Ozone  Depletion  Potential  (ODP) 

Halocarbons,  in  addition  to  being  a  greenhouse  gas,  also  destroy  the  stratospheric  ozone 
layer  that  protects  all  life  from  harmful  ultraviolet  radiation  (Graedel  and  Crutzen,  1990).  An 
ozone  hole,  amounting  to  a  50  percent  reduction  in  ozone  concentration,  now  appears  over  the 
South  Pole  in  the  winter  months  of  the  northern  hemisphere.  Although  some  features  of  the 
Antarctic  ozone  hole  are  not  fully  understood,  there  is  considerable  evidence  that  CfCs  are  a 
major  cause  (Graedel  and  Crutzen,  1990). 

Ozone  depletion  typically  is  considered  in  impact  assessment  and  is  included  as  a  major 
impact  category  in  this  document.  One  way  to  evaluate  ozone  depletion  in  the  context  of  life- 
cycle  impact  assessment  is  to  use  equivalency  units.  In  this  case,  ODP  units  will  be  used. 

Table  4-6  shows  the  type  of  output  from  using  the  ODP  algorithm  for  various  halocarbons 
relative  to  CFC- 1 1 . 

Strengths 

The  primary  strength  of  the  impact  potentials  is  that  they  provide  a  means  of  normalizing 
the  contribution  of  various  substances  within  specific  impact  categories.  This  allows  for  a  direct 
comparison  of  inventory  items  to  determine  which  inventory  items,  or  groups  of  inventory  items, 
contribute  most  significantly  to  a  specific  impact  category. In  addition,  most  of  the  impact 
potential  algorithms  are  based  on  cause-and-effect  relationships.  Thus  unlike  the  checklist  and 
relative  magnitude  approaches,  the  impact  potentials  indicate  an  estimated  environmental  impact 
rather  than  represent  the  data  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis. 

Weaknesses 

One  of  the  general  weaknesses  with  the  impact  potentials  is  that  many  are  based  on  a 
large  number  of  assumptions  which  makes  their  scientific  credibility  questionable.  In  particular, 
the  functions  for  human  toxicity,  terrestrial  toxicity,  and  aquatic  ecotoxicity  potentials  are  based 
on  a  number  of  debated  assumptions  which  include  many  inconsistencies.  Refer  to  SET  AC 
(1994)  for  a  complete  discussion  of  the  problems  and  issues  related  to  these  three  impact 
potentials.

of  the  particular  volatile  organic  compound  (VOC)  relative  to  the 
change  in  photochemical  oxidant  production  due  to  a  change  in 
emission  of  ethylene:  where  a  is  the  change  in  photochemical 
oxidant  formation  due  to  a  change  in  a  VOC  emission,  b  is  the 
integrated  VOC  emission  up  to  that  time,  c  is  the  change  in

Source:  Guinee  and  Heijungs,  1993;  Guinee,  1992a;  and  Guinee,  1992b. 


Another  general  weakness  with  the  impact  potentials  is  that  only  a  handful  of  impact 
categories  (i.e.,  those  listed  in  Table  4-5)  can  currently  be  accounted  for  with  this  method.  In 
addition,  impact  potentials  may  only  be  useful  for  chemical-based  inventory  items,  and  not  all 
chemicals  are  amenable  to  the  development  of  impact  potentials  (such  as  nutrient  and  oxygen¬ 
demanding  chemicals). 

In  addition,  a  common  set  of  impact  potentials  still  needs  to  be  developed  in  order  for  the 
approach  to  be  used  in  impact  assessment.  The  applicability  of  the  impact  potentials  to  impact 
assessment  may  also  be  limited  because  general  environmental  features  or  characteristics  vary 


4-13 


according  to  geographic  location.  This  will  lead  to  variation  among  equivalency  units  and 
diminish  the  utility  of  a  common  database  of  equivalency  units.  Also,  while  the  development  of 
equivalency  factors  is  straightforward  in  principle,  frequently  exposure  and  effects  information 
on  which  equivalency  factors  could  be  based  is  lacking.  Finally,  the  multiple  mechanisms 
involved  in  environmental  processes  are  difficult  to  identify,  making  their  incorporation  into 
equivalency  factors  even  more  difficult.

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

While  impact  potentials  provide  a  relatively  simple  means  for  relating  inventory  data  to 
impact  categories,  as  well  as  a  means  for  aggregating  the  data,  the  delineation  of  equivalency 
factors  presents  a  stumbling  block.  Currently,  equivalency  factors  are  being  developed  for  global 
warming,  ozone  depletion,  acidification,  photochemical  ozone,  nitrification,  and 
biochemical/chemical  oxygen  demand  (BOD/COD). 

Detailed  examples  of  the  use  of  impact  potentials  for  determining  the  GWP  and  ODP  of 
various  emissions  are  provided  in  EPA  (1993a).

4.5  CRITICAL  VOLUME  APPROACH 


The  critical  volume  approach  is  a  variation  on  the  impact  potential  approach  that  is 
applicable  to  ecosystem  and  human  health  impacts.  The  critical  volume  approach  is  used  to 
determine  the  volume  of  air,  water,  or  soil  that  is  needed  to  dilute  specific  substances  to  a 
generally  estimated  toxicity  threshold.  For  example,  if  it  was  known  that  the  threshold 
concentration  for  vegetation  was  100  kg  of  chemical  X  per  1,000  L  of  soil  volume,  and  1,000  kg 
of  chemical  X  were  released,  then  the  critical  volume  would  be  10,000  L  of  soil. 

The  results  of  calculating  critical  volumes  can  be  grouped  into  three  categories:  critical 
volumes  of  air,  water,  and  soil.  Table  4-7  illustrates  an  example  of  applying  the  critical  volume 
method  to  a  hypothetical  set  of  inventory  items.

Strengths 

The  primary  strength  of  the  critical  volume  approach  is  that  it  provides  a  means  of 
normalizing  a  variety  of  data  to  a  common  measure  (i.e.,  critical  volume  in  liters)  of 
environmental  impact.  The  critical  volume  approach  is  relatively  simple  and  convenient  to  use 


4-15 


and  produces  useful  results.  In  addition,  similar  to  the  impact  potentials  described  in  Section  4.4, 
the  calculations  used  in  the  critical  volume  approach  are  based  on  toxicity  and  exposure 
concepts,  which  are  already  familiar  to  environmental  analysts. 

Weaknesses 

To  efficiently  and  successfully  use  the  critical  volume  approach,  a  new  understanding  and 
methodology  for  the  impact  equivalency  approach  must  be  created.  However,  exposure  and 
toxicity  information  is  generally  lacking  for  many  environmental  and  human  impact  areas  with 
which  to  determine  critical  volume  values. 

In  addition,  the  critical  volume  approach  only  takes  into  account  the  assimilation  of  one 
chemical  at  a  time.  This  is,  the  approach  does  not  take  into  account  the  interaction  between 
multiple  chemical  releases  to  the  same  environmental  media.  For  example.  Table  4-7  shows 
10,000  L  and  16,100  L  as  the  critical  volumes  of  soil  needed  to  dilute  1,000  kg  and  161  kg  of 
chemicals  G  and  H,  respectively,  to  generally  accepted  threshold  concentrations.  What  is  not 
provided  is  an  indication  of  how  these  critical  volumes  might  be  affected  as  both  chemicals  are 
released  to  the  same  medium  in  the  same  location. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  critical  volume  approach  can  provide  a  relatively  familiar  framework  (i.e.,  exposure 
and  toxicity  concepts)  for  normalizing  and  comparing  largely  different  types  of  inventory  items. 
In  addition,  the  critical  volume  approach  can  provide  a  simplified  means  of  normalizing  data 
generated  in  inventory  analysis  by  expressing  them  in  terms  of  volumes,  which  are  then 
amenable  to  aggregation  into  common  impact  categories. 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  the  critical  volume  approach  would  be  most  useful 
for  characterizing  chemical  releases.  However,  critical  volume  algorithms  are  currently  available 
for  only  a  limited  number  of  chemicals,  and  the  approach  does  not  lend  itself  to  assessing 
nonchemical  components. 

4.6  ENVIRONMENTAL  PRIORITY  STRATEGY  (EPS) 

The  Federation  of  Swedish  Industries  and  the  Swedish  Environmental  Research  Institute 
initiated  an  Environmental  Priority  Strategies  (EPS)  system  in  collaboration  with  the  Volvo  Car 
Corporation.  Although  based  on  implicit  value  judgments  regarding  the  environmental  impacts 
of  various  substances,  the  EPS  system  nonetheless  provides  a  means  of  calculating,  in  semi- 
quantitative  terms,  the  overall  environmental  impact  of  a  product  system. 


4-16 


The  EPS  system  employs  environmental  indices  to  convert  various  material  uses  and 
emissions  quantified  in  the  inventory  analysis  into  measures  of  impacts.  These  indices  are 
calculated  by  carrying  out  the  following  steps:  (1)  each  material  use  or  emission  being  evaluated 
is  assigned  one  score  for  each  of  the  factors  listed  below,  and  (2)  the  six  factor  scores  are  then 
multiplied  together  to  yield  a  single  score.  This  single  score  is  expressed  in  a  measure  called  the 
environmental  load  unit  (ELU). 

The  factors  that  are  assigned  scores  to  calculate  indices  are  the  following: 

1 .  Scope — the  general  impression  of  the  environmental  impact 

2.  Distribution — the  extent  of  the  area  affected 

3.  Frequency  and/or  Intensity — the  regularity  and  intensity  of  the  problem 

4.  Durability — the  permanence  of  the  effect 

5.  Contribution — significance  of  1  kg  to  the  total  impact 

6.  Remediability — relative  cost  to  reduce  the  emission 

The  higher  the  ELU  of  a  material,  the  higher  its  contribution  to  an  impact  and  vice  versa. 
Table  4-8  presents  selected  environmental  indices  for  raw  materials  and  energy  use  and  for 
releases  to  the  air,  water,  and  soil. 

Once  the  indices  are  determined,  the  environmental  load  value  (ELV)  is  determined  as  a 
description  of  the  impacts  of  the  material  use  or  emission  in  question.  The  ELV  is  calculated,  as 
shown  below,  by  multiplying  the  quantity  of  the  material  use  or  emission  by  its  environmental 
index  (typically  expressed  as  ELU  per  kilogram).  Table  4-9  illustrates  some  generic  ELVs  using 
hypothetical  inventory  analysis  data. 

Environmental  Load  Value  =  Environmental  Index  (ELU)  •  Quantity 

Strengths 

The  primary  strength  of  the  EPS  system  is  its  flexible  framework,  which  allows  analysts 
to  normalize  impacts  for  direct  comparison  of  inventory  items  either  within  or  between  specific 
impact  categories.  A  number  of  environmental  load  indices  have  been  developed  to  date,  thus 
allowing  for  a  relatively  comprehensive  assessment  of  environmental  impacts.  Using  the 
environmental  load  indices  for  specific  materials  and  processes  enables  the  user  to  calculate 
ELVs  for  individual  activities,  processes,  or  an  entire  system.

Weaknesses 

One  of  the  weaknesses  of  the  EPS  systems  is  in  its  primary  assumption  that  a  linear 
relationship  between  ELVs  and  increasing  or  decreasing  quantities  of  inventory  items  exists.  In 
reality,  this  relationship  is  probably  not  linear  but  more  complex.  Another  weakness  of  the  EPS 
system  is  its  reliance  on  value  judgments  to  develop  the  environmental  indices  used  to  calculate 


4-18 


the  ELVs.  For  example,  defining  the  scope  or  “general  impression  of  the  environmental  impact” 
of  the  indices  is  subject  to  different  interpretations  by  different  stakeholders  or  by  different 
geographic  locations.  Also,  EPS  does  not  appear  to  adequately  consider  relative  toxicity  of 
pollutants.  Thus  the  robustness  of  the  indices  is  open  to  debate.  The  same  point  could  also  be 
made  for  the  distribution  and  remediability  components.

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  ELVs  developed  through  the  EPS  system  are  normalized  measures  of  environmental 
concerns  that  can  be  used  to  compare  inventory  items,  or  they  can  be  aggregated  to  compare  life- 
cycle  stages  or  entire  product  systems.  The  ELVs  can  also  be  used  to  compare  the  environmental 
impact  profiles  of  alternative  materials,  processes,  or  products. 


4-19 


The  EPS  system  is  currently  used  in  some  European  LCAs  and  thus  provides  a  practical 
methodology  for  assessing  the  impacts  of  inventory  items  on  the  environment.  However,  the 
EPS  system  is  currently  set  up  primarily  to  assess  impacts  to  ecosystems.  If  developed  and 
refined,  modules  for  assessing  impacts  to  human  health  and  natural  resources  would  enhance  the 
overall  utility  of  EPS. 

4.7  TELLUS  INSTITUTE  HUMAN  HEALTH  HAZARD  RANKING 

One  human  health  hazard  ranking  approach,  used  by  Tellus  Institute  in  an  assessment  of 
packaging  materials  (Tellus  Institute,  1992a,  1992b,  1992c),  groups  inventory  items  into  two 
main  categories  for  assessment:  carcinogens  and  noncarcinogens.  This  section  describes  the 
methods  used  to  assess  each  of  these  impact  groups. 

The  Tellus  approach  assesses  the  relative  human  health  carcinogenic  impact  of  substances 
based  on  a  cancer  potency  factor,  which  is  measured  in  milligrams/kilogram  of  body  weight/day. 
The  cancer  potency  factor  is  designed  to  represent  the  cancer  risk  associated  with  various 
inventory  items.  Isophorone  was  chosen  as  a  baseline  of  comparison  for  the  substances,  because 
it  possesses  the  lowest  cancer  potency.  The  calculated  potency  factors  for  various  substances  are 
shown  in  Table  4-10. 

Noncarcinogenic  substances  were  assessed  on  the  basis  of  each  substance’s  oral  reference 
dose.  While  reference  doses  (RfDs)  can  be  determined  by  two  routes  of  exposure — oral  and 
inhalation — Tellus  used  oral  RfDs  because  many  more  oral  RfDs  are  available  in  the  literature. 
The  oral  reference  dose  provides  an  estimate  of  the  maximum  daily  level  of  exposure  that  will 
not  cause  harm  and  is  measured  in  milligrams  substance/kilogram  body  weight/day  (Tellus 
Institute,  1992b). 

The  higher  the  RfD,  the  less  toxic  the  substance,  since  a  higher  dose  is  needed  for  an 
effect  to  occur.  In  Tellus’ s  ranking,  the  inverse  of  the  RfD  was  used  as  the  ranking  factor  in 
order  for  the  ranking  number  to  be  indicative  of  lower  toxicity.  The  baseline  substance  for  the 
noncarcinogenic  ranking  was  xylene,  because  it  has  the  highest  RfD  (i.e.,  smallest  inverse), 
which  indicates  xylene  is  the  least  toxic  of  the  set  of  pollutants.  Thus  the  inverse  RfDs  are 
compared  to  xylene  to  derive  “xylene  equivalents.”  Table  4-11  illustrates  some  of  the  RfDs  and 
xylene  equivalents  for  specific  substances.

Once  the  carcinogenic  and  noncarcinogenic  rankings  have  been  developed,  the  analyst 
may  want  to  determine  the  relationship  between  the  two  groups  of  substances.  To  accomplish 
this,  Tellus  used  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA)  permissible 
potency  level  (PEL)  figures.  For  xylene,  the  PEL  is  1(X)  parts  xylene  per  million  parts  of  air 
(ppm),  and  for  isophorone,  the  PEL  is  25  ppm.  Converting  the  ppm  units  into  milligrams,  the 
100  ppm  PEL  for  xylene  translates  to  433  mg/m^,  and  the  25  ppm  PEL  for  isophorone  translates 
into  141  mg/m  .  From  these  conversions,  one  might  deduce  that  a  “safe”  dose  of  xylene  is  three 


4-22 


times  the  “safe”  dose  of  isophorone;  thus,  isophorone  has  a  xylene  equivalent  factor  of  three. 

This  relationship  can  be  used  to  compare  and  determine  the  combined  effect  of  the  carcinogenic 
and  noncarcinogenic  groups  as  shown  in  Table  4-12.  In  this  approach,  Tellus  used  isophorone 
and  xylene  equivalents.  Other  possible  equivalent  factors  for  impacts  to  human  health  include 
the  following: 

•  PELs — specify  the  amount  of  a  pollutant  to  which  a  worker  can  be  exposed  over  an 
8-hour  work  day. 

•  Threshold  Limit  Values  (TLVs) — specify  the  amount  of  a  substance  a  worker  can 
be  exposed  to  over  an  8-hour  work  day. 

•  Short-Term  Exposure  Limits  (STELs) — only  established  for  a  small  number  of 
chemicals  and  may  not  be  useful  for  assessing  potentially  large  numbers  of  substances 
found  in  a  typical  life-cycle  inventory. 

•  Immediately  Dangerous  to  Life  and  Health  (IDLHs) — only  established  for  a  small 
number  of  chemicals  and  may  not  be  useful  for  assessing  potentially  large  numbers  of 
substances  found  in  a  typical  life-cycle  inventory. 

•  Maximum  Concentration  Levels  (MCLs) — used  by  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  to 
establish  regulations  for  pollutants  in  public  water  systems.  However,  MCLs  have 
only  been  established  for  a  few  substances. 

Strengths 

The  Tellus  approach  provides  a  practical  example  of  impact  characterization  within  the 
context  of  LCA.  This  approach  assesses  the  relative  human  carcinogenic  and  noncarcinogenic 
impacts  of  substances  based  on  cancer  potency  factors  and  RfDs,  respectively.  These  techniques 
take  into  consideration  well-refined  and  accepted  health  effects  information  to  estimate  relative 
toxicity.  The  Tellus  approach  also  provides  a  means  of  normalizing  and  evaluating  the  relative 
impact  of  a  variety  of  different  substances. 

Weaknesses 

The  main  weakness  of  the  Tellus  ranking  method  is  its  dependence  on  a  relatively 
simplistic  approach  to  comparison  of  cancer  to  noncancer,  and  a  corresponding  lack  of 
transitivity  in  ranking  substances.  In  addition,  for  many  substances,  cancer  potency  factors  and 
RfDs  have  not  yet  been  established,  and  establishing  these  factors  in  the  near  future  may  not  be 
feasible.  In  addition  to  a  lack  of  key  information,  the  Tellus  ranking  only  considers  carcinogenic 
and  noncarcinogenic  human  health  impacts.  It  does  not  consider  persistence  or  bioaccumulation, 
and  does  not  look  at  ecological  impacts.  For  the  purposes  of  impact  assessment,  it  may  also  be 


4-23 


useful  to  have  a  means  of  considering  the  specific  human  health  impacts  (e.g.,  mutagenic  and 
teratogenic  impacts).

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  Tellus  approach  provides  a  means  for  normalizing  and  comparing  both  human 
carcinogenic  and  noncarcinogenic  substances  to  perform  cross-substance  comparisons  of  the 
potential  impact  of  those  substances  to  human  health.  In  addition,  the  Tellus  ranking  methods 
allows  for  determining  the  aggregate  contribution  of  various  life-cycle  stages  or  of  alternative 
products  and  processes  to  human  health  impacts.

4.8  TOXICITY,  PERSISTENCE,  AND  BIOACCUMULATION  PROFILE  (TPBP) 

The  toxicity,  persistence,  and  bioaccumulation  (TPBP)  considers  the  potency  (toxicity)  as 
well  as  the  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  substances  to  assess  their  fate  and  potential 
environmental  impacts  (SET AC,  1993).  The  TPBP  can  be  used  in  two  ways: 

•  to  construct  mobility,  persistence,  and  effects  profiles  for  each  of  the  environmental 
loading  factors  listed  in  the  inventory  analysis,  and 

•  as  a  screening  tool  based  on  identifiable  thresholds  to  determine  whether  to  proceed  to  a 
more  detailed  level  of  assessment  (i.e..  Tier  4  or  Tier  5). 

Input  information  used  in  the  TPBP  can  be  found  in  generally  accepted  testing  studies, 
such  as  the  following,  which  are  readily  described  in  the  public  and  private  literature: 

•  acute  toxicity  testing  (LC50,  EC50,  TD50); 

•  chronic  toxicity  testing  (NOEL); 

•  biodegradation  (half  life,  CO2  evolution);  and 

•  bioaccumulation  (solubility,  octanol/water  coefficient,  bioaccumulation  factor) 

(SET  AC,  1993). 

When  input  data  for  TPBP  are  not  accessible  or  do  not  exist,  using  predictive  structure 
activity  relationships  from  computerized  databases  may  be  possible  (SET AC,  1993).  In  addition, 
for  many  substances,  this  information  can  be  predicted  using  computer  models  or  databases. 
Table  4-13  provides  an  example  of  how  this  information  is  used  to  describe  potential 
environmental  impacts. 

Strengths 

The  strengths  of  the  TPBP  include  the  following: 

•  impacts  to  ecosystems  and  human  health  may  be  considered; 

•  input  data  for  the  TPBP  are  generated  from  generally  accepted  testing  methodologies 
(e.g.,  acute  and  chronic  toxicity  testing); 

•  output  from  the  TPBP  may  be  used  to  identify  priority  substances  for  which  more 
detailed  levels  of  analysis  may  be  desired;  and 

•  TPBP,  unlike  the  previously  described  methods,  considers  information  on  toxicity, 
persistence,  and  bioaccumulation.

Weaknesses 

The  primary  weaknesses  of  the  TPBP  is  that  it  does  not  consider  environmental  exposure 
and  can  only  be  applied  to  a  limited  number  of  substances — mainly  chemicals  (SET AC,  1993). 

It  is  not  clear  how  the  TPBP  would  be  applied  to  nonchemical  components  of  ecosystems  and/or 
human  health;  although  it  seems  possible  to  identify  parameter  and  thresholds,  no  attempt  has 
been  made  to  do  so  (Vigon  and  Evers,  1992). 

In  addition,  there  is  no  consensus  about  the  indices  or  measures  that  are  best  to  use,  and  it 
is  unclear  whether  estimated  values  are  of  acceptable  accuracy  for  LCA  or  how  this  information 
should  be  interpreted  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment  (Vigon  and  Evers,  1992).  This 
approach  could  be  expanded  upon  by  considering  other  health  effects  data,  such  as  cancer 
potency  values  and  RfDs,  and  ecological  toxicity  information. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  TPBP  provides  a  further  level  of  detail  for  impact  equivalency  type  assessments 
because  it  considers  not  only  hazard  (toxicity)  information  but  also  exposure  (persistency  and 


4-26 


bioaccumulation)  information.  The  desired  characteristics  of  the  results  obtained  from  impact 
assessment  may  require  that  such  exposure  information  be  considered.  In  addition,  exposure 
information  may  be  needed  to  distinguish  among  ambiguities  in  impact  equivalency  results.  The 
properties  of  TPBP  make  it  a  good  candidate  to  use  in  developing  priority  listings  of  substances 
listed  in  the  inventory  that  may  require  assessment  at  a  greater  level  of  detail. 

4.9  MACKAY  UNIT  WORLD  MODEL 

The  Mackay  unit  world  model  helps  to  explain  the  mechanisms  and  rates  by  which  toxic 
substances  are  transported  into  and  transformed  within  the  natural  environment.  This  approach 
was  originally  developed  as  a  means  of  assessing  the  likely  environmental  behavior  and  effects 
of  newly  developed  or  used  chemical  compounds  before  their  release  into  the  market  and  the 
environment  (Mackay,  1979). 

The  underlying  concept  of  the  unit  world  model  is  fugacity.  Fugacity  can  be  regarded  as 
the  “escaping  tendency”  of  a  chemical  substance  from  a  phase.  It  has  units  of  pressure  and  can 
be  related  to  concentration.  Just  as  temperature  (°C)  can  be  related  to  heat  concentrations 
(cal/m^)  using  a  proportionality  constant,  to  yield  a  heat  capacity  (cal/[m^  x  °C]),  fugacities  (/) 
can  be  related  to  concentrations  using  a  similar  fugacity  capacity  constant  Z,  with  units  of 
mol/m^atm  by  the  following  equation: 

C  =  Zf 

where  Z  depends  on  temperature,  pressure,  the  nature  of  the  substance,  and  the  medium  in  which 
it  is  present.  Its  concentration  dependence  is  usually  slight  at  high  dilution. 

The  physical  significance  of  Z  is  that  it  quantifies  the  capacity  of  the  phase  for  fugacity. 
At  a  given  fugacity,  if  Z  is  low,  C  is  low — thus  only  a  small  amount  of  substance  is  necessary  to 
exert  the  escaping  tendency.  Toxic  substances  thus  tend  to  accumulate  in  phases  where  Z  is  high 
or  where  high  concentrations  can  be  reached  without  creating  high  fugacities. 

Example:  The  fugacity  capacity  Z  for  oxygen  in  water  at  room  temperature  is  1 .5 
mol/m^  atm  (i.e.,  0.3/0.2).  In  air  it  is  40  mol/m^  atm  (i.e.,  8/0.2),  a  ratio  of  about  27. 
Oxygen  then  adopts  a  concentration  in  air  27  times  that  in  water.  Conclusion:  if  we  can 
find  Z  for  a  substance  for  each  environmental  phase,  we  can  easily  calculate  how  the 
substance  will  partition.  It  will  reach  highest  concentrations  where  Z  is  highest  (Mackay 
and  Paterson,  1981). 


4-27 


Fugacity  is  used  in  the  unit  world  approach  to  calculate  partitioning.  The  unit  world  is  a 
hypothetical  1  km  box  that  contains  water,  soil,  air,  sediment,  and  aquatic  biota.  Mathe¬ 
matically,  the  unit  world  is  represented  by  a  set  of  thermodynamic  equations  that  describe  the 
partitioning  and  transformation  of  a  chemical  introduced  into  the  box.  Chemical-specific 
parameters  are  used  to  predict  the  partitioning  of  a  given  quantity  of  chemical  among  the 
different  components  of  the  unit  world.  To  calculate  environmental  partitioning  in  the  form  of 
amounts  in  each  medium,  it  is  necessary  to  assume  volumes  for  each  medium  and  an  amount  of 
solute.  Medium  volumes  are  based  on  unit  world  volumes,  consisting  of  1  km  with  a  10  km 
high  atmosphere.  In  this  unit  world,  30  percent  of  the  area  is  covered  by  soil  at  a  depth  of  3  cm, 
and  70  percent  is  covered  by  water  at  an  average  depth  of  10  cm  (with  3  cm  of  sediment,  5  ppm 
volume  of  suspended  solids,  and  0.5  ppm  biota).  The  corresponding  volumes  of  these  five 
components  are  as  follows: 

•  Atmosphere — accessible  volume  lO^^m^ 

•  Soil — accessible  volume  lO^m^ 

•  Water — accessible  volume  lO^m^ 

A 

•  Sediment — accessible  volume  10  m 

•  Aquatic  Biota — in  lO^m^ 

The  fugacity  for  each  of  the  compounds  is  calculated  as  follows: 

•  Pure  Substance 

A  pure  substance  (solid  or  liquid)  has  a  fugacity  that  is  approximately  equal  to  its  vapor 
pressure  (P^).  If  its  molar  volume  is  v(m^/g  mol),  then  Z  =  C//  =  1/P^v.  The 
temperature  dependencies  of  and  v  (and  hence  Z)  are  available  in  handbooks. 

•  Vapor  Phase  or  in  the  Atmosphere 

Fugacity  is  usually  equal  to  partial  pressure  (P);  thus,  from  the  gas  law,  if  n  is  mols  and 
V  is  volume,  Z  =  C//  =  nA^P  =  1/RT.  In  the  vapor  phase  Z  is  independent  of  the  nature 
of  the  substance  and  is  usually  about  40  g  mol/m  atm. 

•  Liquid  Phase  or  Water  Bodies 

Fugacity  or  partial  pressure  is  usually  related  to  concentration  by  the  Henry’s  Law 
constant,  H  as  P  =  PC.  It  follows  that  Z  is  simply  1/H.  H  is  easily  calculated  as  the 
ratio  of  pure  substance  vapor  pressure  to  solubility. 

•  Sorbed  Phases 

If  the  sorption  partition  coefficient  Kp  is  the  ratio  of  sorbed  concentration  (g/Mg  or 
ppm)  to  water  concentration  (g/m^  or  ppm),  and  if  the  sorbent  concentration  is  S(g/m^), 
it  can  be  shown  that  Z  is  10'^  KpS/H. 


4-28 


•  Biotic  Phase 

If  the  biota  is  regarded  as  part  (fraction  y)  octanol  and  the  volume  fraction  of  biota  is  B, 
then  Z  is  By  Kow/H,  where  Kow  is  the  octanol  water  partition  coefficient.  Sorbed  and 
biotic  phases  are  the  most  difficult,  but  recent  work  indicates  that  sorption  and 
bioconcentration  can  be  related  to  Kow  and  organic  and  lipid  contents,  thus  providing 
good  estimates  for  Z  (Mackay,  1979). 

By  estimating  the  rates  of  transformation  of  the  chemical  (due  to  photolysis,  oxidation, 
biodegradation,  or  other  processes),  the  unit  world  approach  can  be  used  to  predict  steady-state 
concentrations,  residence  times,  and  removal  rates.  An  example  of  the  type  of  output 
information  derived  from  the  unit  world  approach  is  shown  in  Figure  4-1.  As  shown  in  this 
figure,  the  Mackay  unit  world  approach  provides  the  user  with  information  on  the  partitioning 
and  concentration  of  a  substance  in  air,  water,  soil,  sediment,  suspended  solids,  and  biota.  Thus, 
this  approach  enables  the  user  to  determine  and  compare  the  impact  of  various  substances  on 
individual  components  of  the  environment.  For  more  detailed  explanations  of  the  unit  world 
approach,  see  Mackay  (1979)  and  Mackay  and  Paterson  (1981). 

Strengths 

The  unit  world  model  is  a  relatively  simple  approach  that  has  been  refined  and  widely 
used  over  the  past  15  years  to  quantify  the  environmental  transformation  and  fate  of  chemicals. 
Input  data  for  the  unit  world  model,  which  primarily  include  data  on  chemical  toxicides,  exist  for 
many  different  chemicals  and  are  available  on  readily  accessible  databases,  such  as  the  EPA’s 
AQUIRE  database.  However,  data  on  toxicities  to  terrestrial  plants  and  animals  are  more  scarce 
(SET  AC,  1993). 

Weaknesses 

Drawbacks  of  the  unit  world  model  are  that  it  focuses  only  on  the  fate  of  chemicals; 
human  health  effects  are  not  included.  Some  additional  weaknesses  of  the  unit  world  model 
include  the  following: 

•  results  cannot  be  validated  by  experimental  observation, 

•  data  are  lacking  on  many  chemical  substances,  and 

•  currently  no  practical  application  exists  to  serve  as  a  case  study  example.

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  unit  world  approach  could  provide  a  rational  and  realistic  tool  for  impact  assessment 
that  enables  diverse  inventory  data  to  be  described  in  terms  of  environmental  medium 
partitioning,  concentration  ratios,  and  overall  persistence.  This  approach  may  also  enable  the 
analyst  to  determine  the  sensitivity  of  each  characteristic  (e.g.,  persistence)  as  a  function  of  the 
input  data,  by  altering  these  data  and  observing  the  resulting  effect. 

One  potential  problem  with  using  the  unit  world  model  in  LCA  applications  is  that  in 
many  cases  the  user  will  not  know  the  correct,  proportionate  amount  of  chemical  released  into 
the  unit  world  box  (Vigon  and  Evers,  1992).  For  example,  if  an  inventory  analysis  revealed  that 
a  system  released  100  grams  of  NO^  to  the  air  per  unit  production  and  this  100  grams  was 
directly  inputted  into  the  model,  then  the  equilibrium  partitioning  would  show  the  relative 


4-30 


concentrations  of  NO^  in  each  of  the  model  components.  However,  without  proportionately 
loading  the  100  grams  of  NO^  into  the  unit  world  box,  the  concentrations  produced  would  be 
meaningless  for  comparison  against  toxicological  standards  (Vigon  and  Evers,  1992). 

An  LCA-specific  case  study  using  the  unit  world  model  is  needed  to  better  assess  its 
relevance  to  impact  assessment. 

4.10  CANONICAL  ENVIRONMENT  MODELING 

Canonical  environment  modeling  is  similar  to,  but  somewhat  more  complex  and  realistic 
than,  the  unit  world  approach.  Instead  of  using  a  1  square  kilometer  unit  world,  the  canonical 
approach  uses  a  simulated  reference  environment,  or  a  “canonical  environment,”  such  as  a 
generalized  stream,  lake,  pond,  or  other  ecosystem  type.  Canonical  environments  do  not  usually 
represent  any  specific  real  ecosystem;  rather,  they  are  representative  of  a  class  of  ecosystems 
within  a  general  region. 

In  contrast  to  the  relatively  small  number  of  parameters  needed  by  the  unit  world 
approach,  canonical  environment  modeling  generally  requires  a  wide  variety  of  environmental 
parameters  (e.g.,  soil  organic  matter  content,  stream  flow).  Canonical  environment  models  are 
routinely  used  by  EPA  and  other  organizations  for  ecological  risk  assessments  (see  Bamthouse  et 
al.,  1984  and  1985;  Suter  et  al.,  1985a  and  1985b). 

To  date,  many  applications  of  the  canonical  environment  approach  have  focused 
modeling  efforts  on  aquatic  systems.  However,  similar  approaches  have  been  established  for 
assessing  the  fate  of  pollutants  in  terrestrial  systems.  Examples  of  such  approaches  are  found  in 
Bamthouse  et  al.  (1985a  and  1985b)  and  Suter  et  al.  (1984  and  1985).  These  models  simulate 
atmospheric  dispersion  and  deposition  of  pollutants  on  soil  and  uptake  of  pollutants  by  biota 
(plants  and  animals). 

EPA’s  Office  of  Toxic  Substances  (OTS)  also  uses  the  canonical  environment  concept  to 
evaluate  the  fate  of  pesticides  in  generic  rivers,  lakes,  and  estuaries  as  part  of  its  Exposure 
Analysis  Modeling  System  (EXAMS). 

Strengths 

Canonical  environmental  modeling  provides  information  on  the  fate  and  transformation 
of  chemical  releases  in  various  environmental  media  (e.g.,  air,  water,  soil,  biota).  Such 


4-31 


information  enables  analysts  to  consider  not  only  the  level  of  pollutants  released  to  various 
environmental  media  (i.e.,  loading  assessment),  but  also  the  ultimate  fate  of  those  pollutants. 

Canonical  environmental  models  also  have  routinely  been  used  by  EPA  and  other 
organizations  for  ecological  risk  assessments.  Although  many  of  these  applications  have  been 
for  modeling  aquatic  systems,  similar  approaches  have  been  developed  for  terrestrial  and 
atmospheric  modeling.  A  wide  body  of  practical  examples  and  experience  are  available  for 
potential  users  to  draw  upon  for  guidance. 

Weaknesses 

One  weakness  of  canonical  environment  modeling  is  that  there  are  no  means  to  account 
for  nonchemical  factors  and  to  directly  account  for  impacts  to  human  health.  In  addition,  it 
might  be  (in  most  cases)  uncommon  that  threshold  levels  of  toxicity,  etc.,  will  be  exceeded  by 
the  environmental  releases  of  any  system  acting  alone  in  a  given  region.  It  is  unclear  how  the 
canonical  models  would  handle  cumulative  releases  from  multiple  facilities  within  a  given 
region.  Canonical  environment  modeling  also  does  not  measure  impacts  per  se,  but  rather  the 
fate  and  transformation  of  pollutants  in  different  environmental  media.  Although  such 
information  can  provide  a  useful  proxy  for  “impacts,”  most  environmental  components  have 
some  level  of  assimilative  capacity,  so  assuming  that  the  fate  of  a  pollutant  in  a  specific 
environmental  media  will  necessarily  impact  that  component  can  be  misleading. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  canonical  environment  models  (at  their  present  state 
of  development)  would  be  most  useful  for  characterizing  impacts  to  ecosystems  or  resource 
supplies  (e.g.,  water  bodies,  forests).  Although  applications  of  canonical  models  to  assess 
impacts  to  animal  populations  have  been  performed,  using  these  models  to  assess  impacts  to 
human  health  is  not  clear. 

Canonical  environment  models  also  may  be  useful  in  impact  assessment  when 
information  (including  fate  and  transformation)  on  an  additional  level  of  detail  is  needed  to 
distinguish  between  a  number  of  different  pollutants  releases  to  the  same  or  different 
environmental  media. 

4.11  ECOLOGICAL  RISK  ASSESSMENT 

Within  the  last  3  years,  two  independent  groups — the  EPA  Risk  Assessment  Forum  and 
the  National  Academy  of  Science  (NAS)  Committee  on  Risk  Assessment  Methodology — have 


4-32 


attempted  to  develop  paradigms  for  ecological  risk  assessment.  EPA  defines  ecological  risk 
assessment  as  a  process  that  evaluates  the  likelihood  that  adverse  ecological  effects  may  occur  or 
are  occurring  as  a  result  of  exposure  to  one  or  more  stressors.  Stressors  are  defined  as  any 
physical,  chemical,  or  biological  entity  that  can  induce  adverse  effects  on  individuals, 
populations,  communities,  or  ecosystems  (EPA,  1992a  and  1992b). 

The  EPA’s  current  framework  for  ecological  risk  assessment  is  conceptually  similar  to 
the  risk  assessment  approach  used  for  human  health  risk  assessment,  as  outlined  in  the  1983 
NAS  report,  “Risk  Assessment  in  the  Federal  Government:  Managing  the  Process.”  However, 
ecological  risk  assessment  can  be  distinguished  from  human  health  risk  assessment  by  three 
primary  concepts: 

•  Ecological  risk  assessment  can  consider  effects  beyond  those  on  individuals  of  a  single 
species  and  examine  entire  populations. 

•  There  is  no  single  set  of  ecological  values  to  be  protected  that  can  be  generally  applied. 
Rather,  these  values  are  selected  from  a  number  of  possibilities  based  on  both  scientific 
and  policy  considerations. 

•  There  is  an  increasing  awareness  of  the  need  for  ecological  risk  assessments  to  consider 
nonchemical  as  well  as  chemical  loadings  (EPA,  1992a  and  1992b). 

The  EPA  conceptual  framework  for  ecological  risk  assessment  is  illustrated  in  Figure  4-2. 
This  framework  consists  of  three  major  phases: 

1 .  Problem  Formulation:  a  planning  and  scoping  process  that  establishes  the  goals, 
breadth,  and  focus  of  the  risk  assessment.  The  process  of  problem  formulation 
begins  with  characterizing  ecological  exposure  to  loadings  and  ecological  effects, 
which  includes  evaluating  loading  characteristics,  evaluating  the  ecosystem 
potentially  at  risk,  and  evaluating  the  expected  or  observed  ecological  effects  (EPA, 
1992a).  The  output  of  the  problem  formulation  is  a  conceptual  model  that  provides  a 
qualitative  description  of  how  a  given  loading  can  affect  an  ecological  component. 

2.  Analysis:  a  process  of  developing  profiles  of  environmental  exposure  and  the 
effects  of  stressors  that  involve  two  primary  activities:  characterization  of  exposure 
and  characterization  of  ecological  effects.  The  outputs  of  this  phase  of  the  risk 
assessment  are  exposure  and  loading-response  profiles  that  serve  as  input  to  the  risk 
characterization  phase  described  below. 

3.  Risk  Characterization:  a  process  that  integrates  the  exposure  and  effects  profiles 
(EPA,  1992a).  Risk  characterization  involves  two  distinct  activities:  risk  estimation 
and  risk  description.  The  ecological  risk  summary  provides  a  summary  of  risk 
estimation  and  uncertainty  analysis  results  and  assesses  the  level  of  confidence  in  the 
risk  estimates  through  a  discussion  of  the  weight  of  evidence.

Models  for  use  in  ecological  risk  assessment  are  currently  in  developmental  stages, 
although  for  some  ecological  components  models  do  not  yet  exist.  For  an  overview  and  detailed 
descriptions  of  specific  models  and  approaches  that  may  be  applicable  for  use  in  ecological  risk 
assessments  referr  to  EPA  (1992a  and  1992b). 

Strengths 

Among  the  strengths  of  site-specific  ecological  risk  assessment  is  that  it  provides  the 
most  ecologically  relevant  understanding  on  the  existence  of  or  lack  of  chemical-based  impacts 
to  ecosystems  (SET AC,  1993).  Models  and  methods  used  in  ecological  risk  assessment  have 
been  developed  and  refined  for  a  number  of  years  in  a  variety  of  different  fields,  and  analysts  can 
draw  on  the  considerable  amount  of  practical  experience  in  the  use  of  these  methods. 

Weaknesses 

In  addition  to  the  large  resource  requirements  needed  to  perform  a  comprehensive 
ecological  risk  assessment,  the  results  of  a  comprehensive  study  may  not  lend  themselves  to  an 
analysis  of  alternative  production  systems.  In  addition,  virtually  all  of  the  existing  studies  relate 
to  specific  sites  with  widespread  environmental  contamination  from  past  disposal  practices  or  the 
potential  for  future  environmental  contamination  (SET AC,  1993). 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

Because  of  both  the  technical  and  resource  requirements  needed  to  perform  a 
comprehensive  ecological  risk  assessment,  its  use  in  impact  assessment  would  most  likely  be 
limited  to  LCAs  of  a  reduced  scope  or  be  used  to  assess  critical  impact  areas  identified  in  a  less 
detailed  analysis  after  being  triggered  by  the  outcome  of  generic  exposure/effects  modeling 
efforts. 


A  study  to  evaluate  the  applicability  of  the  methods  and  models  used  in  ecological  risk 
assessment  (see  EPA,  1992a  and  1992b)  would  allow  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  possible 
linkages  between  ecological  risk  assessment  and  LCA,  but  this  issue  may  not  be  considered  high 
priority  for  the  following  reasons: 

•  ecological  risk  assessment  methods  are  already  being  refined  for  other  purposes, 

•  the  use  of  this  level  of  detail  (i.e..  Tier  5)  would  be  rare  in  an  impact  assessment,  and 

•  those  people  performing  risk  assessments  are  already  familiar  with  the  basic  methods.

4.12  HUMAN  HEALTH  RISK  ASSESSMENT 


Site-specific  exposure/effects  assessment  can  be  accomplished  through  using  traditional 
risk  assessment  methodology,  which  includes  the  following  four  components: 

1 .  Hazard  Identification;  involves  gathering  and  evaluating  toxicity  data  on  the  types 
of  health  injury  or  disease  that  may  be  produced  by  a  chemical  and  on  the  conditions 
of  exposure  under  which  injury  or  disease  occurs.  It  may  also  involve 
characterization  of  the  behavior  of  a  chemical  within  the  body  and  the  interactions  it 
undergoes  with  organs,  cells,  or  even  parts  of  cells.  Data  of  the  latter  type  can  be 
valuable  in  answering  the  ultimate  question  of  whether  the  forms  of  toxicity  known 
to  be  produced  by  a  chemical  agent  in  one  population  group  or  in  experimental 
settings  are  also  likely  to  be  produced  in  the  human  population  group  of  interest. 
Note  that  risk  is  not  assessed  at  this  stage;  hazard  identification  is  conducted  to 
determine  whether  and  to  what  degree  it  is  scientifically  correct  to  infer  that  toxic 
effects  observed  in  one  setting  will  occur  in  other  settings  (e.g.,  are  chemicals  found 
to  be  carcinogenic  or  teratogenic  in  experimental  animals  also  likely  to  be  so  in 
adequately  exposed  humans?). 

2.  Dose-Response  Assessment:  involves  describing  the  quantitative  relationship 
between  the  amount  of  exposure  to  a  chemical  and  the  extent  of  toxic  injury  or 
disease.  Data  are  derived  from  animal  studies  or,  less  frequently,  from  studies  in 
exposed  human  populations.  A  chemical  agent  may  have  many  different  dose- 
response  relationships  depending  on  the  conditions  of  exposure  (e.g.,  single  versus 
repeated  exposures)  and  the  response  (e.g.,  cancer  or  birth  defects)  being  considered. 

3.  Exposure  Assessment:  involves  describing  the  nature  and  size  of  the  various 
populations  exposed  to  a  chemical  agent  and  the  magnitude  and  duration  of  their 
exposures.  The  evaluation  could  concern  past  exposures,  current  exposures,  or 
exposures  anticipated  in  the  future. 

4.  Risk  Characterization:  involves  integrating  the  data  and  analyses  involved  in  the 
other  three  steps  of  risk  assessment  to  determine  the  likelihood  that  the  human 
population  of  interest  will  experience  any  of  the  various  forms  of  toxicity  associated 
with  a  chemical  under  its  known  or  anticipated  conditions  of  exposure  (Environ, 
1988). 

The  final  step  in  human  health  risk  assessment,  risk  characterization,  is  designed  to 
generate  several  types  of  risk  estimates  from  the  results  of  the  first  three  steps.  Since  a  risk 
assessment  typically  focuses  on  one  or  two  adverse  human  health  effects,  it  does  not  reflect  the 
full  range  of  adverse  effects  of  the  agent  or  agents  in  question.  Various  choices  for  risk  measures 
exist,  as  shown  in  Table  4-14.  The  risk  measure  chosen  is  based  on  how  the  risk  assessor 
collects  and  organizes  information  as  well  as  the  needs  of  decisionmakers.

The  risk  characterization  step  of  human  health  risk  assessment  contains  a  number  of  areas 
where  decisions  need  to  be  made.  Some  key  decision  areas  might  include  the  following: 

•  What  are  the  statistical  uncertainties  in  estimating  the  extent  of  health  effects?  How  are 
these  uncertainties  to  be  computed  and  presented? 

•  What  are  the  biological  uncertainties  in  estimating  the  extent  of  health  effects?  What  is 
their  origin?  How  will  they  be  estimated?  What  effect  do  they  have  on  quantitative 
estimates?  How  will  the  uncertainties  be  described  to  decisionmakers? 

•  Which  dose-response  assessments  and  exposure  assessments  should  be  used? 

•  Which  population  groups  should  be  the  primary  targets  for  protection  and  which 
provide  the  most  meaningful  expression  of  the  health  risk?  (National  Research 
Council,  1983) 


4-37 


Strengths 

Among  the  strengths  of  site-specific  human  health  risk  assessment  is  that  it  provides  the 
most  relevant  understanding  of  the  existence  of,  or  lack  of,  chemical-based  impacts  to  human 
health.  Models  and  methods  used  in  human  health  risk  assessment  have  been  developed  and 
refined  for  a  number  of  years  in  a  variety  of  different  fields,  so  analysts  have  a  considerable 
amount  of  practical  experience  in  using  these  methods. 

Weaknesses 

The  assumptions  regarding  the  shape  of  the  dose-response  curve  (e.g.,  linear  versus 
nonlinear)  and  the  existence  of  thresholds  below  which  no  impact  occurs  can  have  a  dramatic 
effect  on  the  final  impact  level.  For  example,  no  impact  will  be  estimated  if  the  ambient 
concentration  associated  with  a  particular  emission  source  is  under  the  threshold  (i.e.,  the  highest 
value  at  which  no  adverse  health  impacts  can  be  associated  with  a  pollutant).  Dose-response 
functions  are  not  always  available  for  some  impacts  of  concern.  For  instance,  human  health 
impacts  associated  with  regulated  air  pollutants  usually  have  fairly  well-documented  dose- 
response  curves,  but  other  impacts  of  air  pollution  (e.g.,  damage  to  exposed  building  materials) 
have  not  been  fully  investigated. 

In  addition,  the  analyst  must  estimate  the  population  and/or  resources  at  risk  to  exposure. 
This  may  be  as  simple  as  estimating  the  number  of  people  living  in  the  locale  being  used  in  this 
case  study.  However,  the  exercise  can  become  more  complex  if  only  certain  portions  of  the 
human  population  are  affected  (e.g.,  asthmatics,  children).  For  ecosystem  and  natural  resource 
impacts,  the  components  at  risk  are  often  very  difficult  to  estimate.  In  most  cases,  surveys  of 
vegetation,  aquatic  populations,  and  exposed  building  materials,  for  example,  are  needed.  If  such 
information  does  not  already  exist,  it  must  be  gathered  from  the  field,  which  is  a  very  time- 
consuming  and  expensive  task. 

A  number  of  different  factors  govern  the  degree  of  contact,  or  exposure,  a  person  has  with 
a  toxic  agent,  including  the  period  of  time  (duration)  a  person  is  exposed  to  the  agent,  the  route 
(inhalation,  dermal,  ingestion,  ocular,  injection)  of  exposure,  the  amount  of  agent  absorbed  into 
the  body  by  each  route  of  exposure,  environmental  concentration  of  specific  agents,  and  the 
tolerance  of  the  exposed  population  to  the  agent.  In  addition  to  these  factors,  the  risk  assessor 
must  also  consider  the  demographic  characteristics  of  the  exposed  population  to  determine  the 
physiological  parameters  that  affect  exposure.

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 


Because  of  both  the  technical  and  resource  requirements  needed  to  perform  a 
comprehensive  human  health  risk  assessment,  its  use  in  impact  assessment  would  most  likely  be

CHAPTER  5 

RESOURCE  DEPLETION:  ISSUES  AND  CHARACTERIZATION  METHODS 


This  chapter  includes  discussions  of  issues  related  to  the  depletion  of  natural  resources 
and  describes  selected  methods  for  characterizing  resource  depletion  that  have  been  discussed  or 
presented  in  the  context  of  LCA.  Whereas  some  of  the  methods  profiled  in  Chapter  4  account 
for  the  degradation  of  natural  resources — that  is,  impacts  to  the  supplies  of  natural  resources 
(e.g.,  contamination  of  water  supplies) — this  chapter  includes  those  methods  to  characterize 
natural  resource  depletion  only.  In  the  context  of  LCA,  resource  depletion  has  traditionally  been 
addressed  in  a  different  manner  than  other  types  of  impacts  and  thus  has  been  separated  from 
other  methods  of  impact  assessment  as  described  in  Chapter  4. 

5.1  RESOURCE  DEPLETION:  KEY  TERMS  AND  CONCEPTS 

The  term  natural  resources,  in  the  context  of  LCA,  refers  to  any  component  directly  or 
indirectly  derived  from  the  natural  environment  (EPA,  1992c).  Natural  resources  provide  the 
basic  raw  materials  for  most  production  systems.  They  can  be  used  as  inputs  to  production 
systems  in  the  form  of  raw  materials  or  energy,  or  they  can  be  altered  or  their  value  diminished 
as  a  result  of  outputs  from  a  production  system  (EPA,  1992c).  The  complete  life  cycle  of 
resources  is  illustrated  in  Figure  5-1. 

Natural  resources  are  typically  classified  as  either  stock  or  flow  resources.  This  section 
discusses  the  distinction  between  stock  and  flow  resources  as  it  relates  specifically  to  impact 
assessment.  This  distinction  between  stock  and  flow  resources  is  important  to  consider  because 
the  procedures  for  characterizing  impacts  to  each  of  these  categories  may  be  slightly  different. 

Stock  resources  include  those  that  cannot  be  replenished  through  natural  processes  on 
time  scales  relevant  to  human  societies  (SETAC,  1993;  EPA,  1992c).  Examples  of  stock 
resources  might  include  fossil  fuels,  mineral  ores,  surface  and  ground  water,  and  soil.  Stock 
resources  are  typically  considered  finite.  In  contrast,  flow  resources  include  those  that  can  be 
readily  replenished  either  by  natural  or  artificial  processes  (EPA,  1992c).  Examples  of  flow 
resources  include  most  flora  and  fauna  (e.g.,  trees,  fish,  wildlife). 

Key  issues  associated  with  considering  stock  and  flow  resources  in  impact  assessment 
include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  following:

•  Base  Consumption  Rates:  values  for  the  current  consumption  rates  are  governed  by 
how  clearly  the  resource  is  defined  and  the  spatial  and  temporal  scales  within  which 
rates  are  calculated. 

•  Economic  Factors:  levels  of  natural  resource  reserves  are  governed  by  the  supply  of 
(e.g.,  higher  resources  prices  may  allow  for  increased  exploration  of  reserves)  and 
demand  for  (e.g.,  lower  resources  prices  typically  lead  to  higher  rates  of  consumption) 
natural  resources. 

•  Substitutability:  the  use  of  substitute  materials  can  preclude  or  reduce  the  rate  of 
depletion  of  natural  resource  reserves.

•  Induced  Consumption:  because  the  state  of  depletion  of  various  resources  can  change 
over  time,  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  induced  consumption  should  be  considered 
both  before  and  after  the  recommendations  included  in  the  LCA  are  implemented. 

•  Intrinsic  Renewability  Rates:  the  growth  rates  for  various  flow  resources  change 
over  time  (due  to,  for  example,  increased  fertilization)  and  must  be  characterized  and 
compared  to  their  maximum  growth  rates  limited  by  the  organism  (SETAC,  1993). 

5.2  SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT  AND  ITS  RELATIONSHIP  TO  RESOURCE 

DEPLETION 

The  concept  of  sustainable  development  is  central  to  any  evaluation  of  the  depletion  of 
natural  resources — both  stock  and  flow.  The  term  “sustainable  development”  came  into 
widespread  use  in  1987  when  the  World  Commission  on  Environment  and  Development  (1987) 
released  its  report  Our  Common  Future,  in  which  “sustainable  development  was  defined  as 
“development  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  present  generation  without  compromising  the  ability  of 
future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs.” 

Since  then,  sustainable  development  has  taken  on  a  multifaceted  definition  embodied  in  a 
process  of  development  that  achieves  the  following  goals:  1)  a  level  of  per-capita  consumption 
sustainable  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time;  2)  distributional  equity;  3)  environmental  protection, 
including  protection  of  biological  diversity  and  the  continued  functioning  of  complex  natural 
systems;  and  4)  participation  of  all  sectors  of  society  in  decisionmaking  (Ascher  and  Healy, 
1990). 


Although  the  concept  of  sustainable  development  is  relatively  simple  to  understand, 
translating  the  seemingly  simple  concept  into  practice  is  still  confusing.  According  to 
Ruckelshaus  (1989),  achieving  a  state  of  sustainable  development  would  embody  the  following 
beliefs: 

1 .  The  human  species  is  part  of  nature. 

Its  existence  depends  on  its  ability  to  draw  sustenance  from  a  finite  natural  world; 
its  continuance  depends  on  its  ability  to  abstain  from  destroying  the  natural 
systems  that  regenerate  this  world.  This  seems  to  be  the  major  lesson  of  the 
current  environmental  situations  as  well  as  being  a  direct  corollary  of  the  second 
law  of  thermodynamics. 

2.  Economic  activity  must  account  for  the  environmental  costs  of  production. 

Environmental  regulation  has  made  a  start  here,  albeit  a  small  one.  The  market 
has  not  even  begun  to  be  mobilized  to  preserve  the  environment;  as  a 


5-3 


consequence  an  increasing  amount  of  the  “wealth”  we  create  is  in  a  sense  stolen 
from  our  descendants. 

3.  The  maintenance  of  a  livable  global  environment  depends  on  the  sustainable 
development  of  the  entire  human  family. 

If  80  percent  of  the  members  of  our  species  are  poor,  we  cannot  hope  to  live  in  a 
world  at  peace;  if  the  poor  nations  attempt  to  improve  their  lot  by  the  methods  we 
rich  have  pioneered,  the  result  will  eventually  be  world  ecological  damage. 

Although  these  beliefs  seem  well  intended  (and  more  or  less  obvious)  they  currently  are 
not  incorporated  into  organizational  policymaking,  unless  it  is  in  the  organization’s  best  interest 
to  do  so — such  interests  would  generally  include  the  realization  of  some  benefit  from  changing 
or  averting  regulations  or  sanctions.  For  interests  to  be  changed,  three  things  are  required: 

•  A  clear  set  of  values  consistent  with  the  consciousness  of  sustainability  must  be 
articulated  by  leaders  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors. 

•  Motivations  that  will  support  these  values  need  to  be  established. 

•  Institutions  must  be  developed  that  will  effectively  apply  the  motivations  (Ruckelshaus, 
1989). 

From  an  ecological  point  of  view,  a  necessary  (but  not  sufficient)  condition  for 
sustainable  development  is  maintaining  an  adequate  environmental  resource  endowment.  This 
endowment  constitutes  the  natural  capital  (assets)  necessary  to  provide  needed  and  wanted 
environmental  services — such  as  climate  stabilization,  food  supply,  biological  waste  disposal, 
and  materials  recycling. 

In  the  context  of  LCA,  only  two  long-term  fates  for  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  a 
production  system  are  possible:  recycling  /reuse  or  dissipative  loss.  The  more  materials  that  are 
recycled,  the  less  dissipation  to  the  environment,  and  vice  versa.  Dissipative  losses  must  be 
made  up  by  replacement  from  virgin  sources.  A  sustainable  industrial  state  would  therefore  be 
characterized  by  minimum  use  of  natural  resources  and  recycling  of  intrinsically  toxic  or 
hazardous  materials  or  any  other  materials  that  cause  environmental  problems. 

5.3  RESOURCE  DEPLETION  MODELS 

The  resource  depletion  models  described  in  this  section  are  “time-metric”  models.  Such 
models  are  based  on  the  basic  principle  that  the  quantity  of  stock  or  flow  resource  reserves 
(R — in  units  of  mass)  can  be  measured  at  any  point  in  time  tj.  Another  class  of  resource 
depletion  models  is  known  as  “value-metric”  models,  which  generally  attempt  to  maximize  the 


5-4 


net  value  to  society  of  any  given  resource  consumption  scheme.  In  essence,  value-metric  models 
can  be  used  to  estimate  a  benefit-cost  ratio  derived  from  producing  a  product  versus  consuming 
the  resources  required  to  produce  the  product  (EPA,  1992c).  Because  value-metric  models 
impress  a  “value”  on  the  used  resources,  they  may  be  considered  valuation  methods.  Thus 
value-metric  models  are  not  discussed  in  this  section.  For  a  description  of  value-metric  models, 
see  Section  6.4  on  economic  valuation  in  this  document. 

The  focus  of  this  section  is  on  time-metric  resource  depletion  models.  The  key  factor  in 
time-metric  models  is  the  resource  utilization  rate,  which  is  expressed  as  the  rate  of  resource 
replenishment  (dR/dt)  minus  the  rate  of  resource  consumption  at  time  (q): 

dR  dR 

Resource  Utilization  Rate  =  —  =  dR  ^ 

dl,  dt, 

For  stock  resources,  such  as  fossil  fuels  and  minerals,  the  rate  of  resource  replenishment 
is  considered  to  be  zero  because  it  precludes  any  replenishment  that  is  relevant  to  human 
societies.  With  a  rate  of  resource  replenishment  equal  to  zero,  the  resource  utilization  rate  will 
be  negative,  and  any  level  of  resource  consumption  will  draw  down,  or  deplete,  available 
reserves  of  the  stock  resource.  For  flow  resources,  such  as  trees,  the  rate  of  resource  utilization 
can  be  negative  or  positive,  depending  on  whether  resources  are  being  consumed  more  slowly  or 
more  quickly  than  their  rate  of  replenishment.  When  calculating  the  resource  utilization  rate,  a 
negative  value  represents  a  net  resource  depletion,  while  a  positive  value  represents  a  net 
resource  accumulation. 

Dividing  the  resource  reserves  by  the  rate  of  resource  utilization  yields  an  estimate  of  the 
time  (T)  until  the  reserves  are  completely  depleted. 

Time  Until  Depletion  of  Reserves  =  T  =  R/dR/dtj 

A  positive  t-value  represents  an  accumulation  of  the  resource,  and  the  quantity  depends 
on  the  magnitude  of  the  t-value.  A  negative  t-value  represents  resource  depletion,  where  the 
magnitude  of  t  represents  the  time  until  the  resource  reserves  are  completely  exhausted. 

Strengths 

The  majority  of  existing  time-metric  models  are  relatively  simple  to  use  and 
straightforward  to  understand.  These  models  also  provide  a  normalizing  factor  for  aggregating 
resource  depletion  within  a  resource  category  (e.g.,  fossil  fuels)  or  for  comparing  the  depletion 


5-5 


of  alternative  resources  (e.g.,  natural  gas  and  oil).  In  addition,  the  time-metric  models  can 
provide  an  estimate  of  the  remediability  of  the  impact  (i.e.,  the  lower  the  magnitude  of  the  t- 
value,  the  less  tractable  the  impact). 

Weaknesses 

The  primary  weakness  of  the  time-metric  models  is  that  they  do  not  account  for  whether 
the  replenishment  of  a  flow  resource  is  equal  in  quality  to  the  original  resource  pool.  For 
instance,  although  old-growth  forest  products  represent  a  viable  flow  resource,  replenishment  by 
managed  replanting  will  not  return  the  forest  to  its  original  level  of  value  or  quality — at  least  in 
the  near  future.  In  addition,  the  time-metric  models  do  not  account  for  technological  advances 
that  alter  the  patterns  of  resource  depletion,  or  for  the  potential  substitutability  of  resources  in 
the  future. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  the  depletion  of  a  stock  resource  using  the  time- 
metric  models  would  involve  comparing  the  remaining  use  years  with  and  without  the  product  or 
process  system,  or  with  and  without  specified  alternatives.  In  addition,  any  evaluation  of  stock- 
resource  depletion  should  consider  intergenerational  equity  or  social  welfare.  For  instance, 
short-term  exhaustion  of  a  stock  resource  would  place  a  higher  value  on  current  populations  than 
future  populations.  The  analytical  approach  used  in  time-metric  models  allows  for  a  clearer 
understanding  of  the  distinction  between  stock  and  flow  resources  at  local  and  global  scales  and 
provides  the  analyst  with  specific  units  for  measuring  resource  depletion. 

5.3.1  Resource  Consumption  Ratio 

The  resource  consumption  ratio  approach  characterizes  the  depletion  of  natural  resources 
by  comparing  the  magnitude  of  energy  and  material  consumption  to  available  supplies  or 
reserves  (EPA,  1992a).  The  resource  consumption  ratio  is  expressed  by  the  following  equation: 

Resource  ConsumpUon  Ratio  =  Consumpdon  per  unit  of  use  per  unit  time 

Supply  per  unit  time 

Data  on  the  consumption  of  natural  resources  per  unit  use  per  unit  time  may  be  taken 
directly  from  the  inventory  analysis.  Information  on  the  supply,  or  reserves,  of  natural  resources 
can  be  obtained  from  public  or  private  sources  (e.g.,  government  reports,  nongovernmental 
organizations  [NGO]  publications).  The  information  obtained  on  the  supplies  of  natural 


5-6 


resources  may  need  to  be  normalized  by  conversion  to  a  standard  production  time  unit — usually 
annual.  In  addition,  data  on  the  supply  of  natural  resources  can  have  various  measures  for 
yields,  as  well  as  for  resource  reserve  use  rates.  Different  measures  for  yields  may  also  need  to 
be  normalized.  Table  5-1  provides  examples  of  the  application  of  the  resource  consumption 
ratio  to  various  generic  data. 

In  addition  to  providing  a  means  for  comparing  the  use  of  natural  resources  to  existing 
supplies,  the  resource  consumption  ratio  may  also  be  used  to  assess  the  degradation  of  natural 
resources  resulting  from  ou^uts  or  pollutants.  Assessing  the  degradation  of  natural  resource 
supplies  could  be  accomplished  by  comparing  the  level  of  exposure  to  a  pollutant  to  the 
assimilative  capacity  of  the  natural  resource  supply.  For  example,  if  the  level  of  exposure  of 
resource  stock  A  to  chemical  X  is  10,000  kg/year  and  the  assimilative  capacity  of  chemical  X  to 
resource  stock  A  is  7,500  kg/year,  then  the  resource  consumption  ratio  would  be  1.33.  Used  in 
this  manner,  a  resource  consumption  ratio  that  is  greater  than  1  signifies  that  exposure  to  a 
pollutant  is  greater  than  the  assimilative  capacity  of  the  resource  stock  and  is  thus  a  net  resource 
degradation.  A  ratio  that  is  less  than  1  signifies  that  the  resource  is  able  to  assimilate  the 
pollutant  completely.  (However,  this  ratio  does  not  account  for  exposure  to  multiple  pollutants.) 

The  resource  consumption  ratio  provides  a  simple  means  of  normalizing  product  or 
process  input  data.  The  normalized  figures  may  serve  as  indicators  of  unsustainable  resource  use 
or  degradation  and/or  may  be  used  to  compare  alternative  input  materials  to  identify  those  that 
yield  minimal  natural  resource  impacts.  In  addition,  data  on  the  consumption  of  natural 
resources  generated  in  the  inventory  analysis  may  be  used  directly.  Information  on  the  supply, 
or  reserves,  of  natural  resources  can  be  obtained  from  public  or  private  sources  (e.g., 
government  reports,  NGO  publications).

Significant  efforts  may  be  required  to  develop  resource  supply  and  exposure  information 
for  this  approach,  and  it  is  not  clear  whether  calculating  resource  consumption  ratios  for 
individual  products  or  processes  or  the  incremental  total  demand  for  the  resource  will  be 
necessary.  In  addition,  the  significance  of  the  resource  consumption  ratio  is  unclear. 

5.3.2  Resource  Depletion  Matrix 

The  resource  depletion  matrix  is  a  variation  of  the  time-metric  model  that  provides  a 
conceptual  framework  for  evaluating  both  the  local  and  global  depletion  of  stock  and  flow 
resources.  This  approach  provides  a  more  analytical  characterization  of  stock-  and  flow- 
resource  depletion  than  that  obtained  from  inventory  analyses.  The  more  analytical  approach 
used  in  this  resource  depletion  matrix  allows  for  a  clearer  understanding  of  the  distinction 
between  stock  and  flow  resources  at  the  local  and  global  scales  and  provides  the  analyst  with 
specific  units  for  measuring  resource  depletion. 

For  stock  resources  (e.g.,  fossil  fuels  or  minerals),  measures  of  depletion  are  reflected  by 
their  rate  of  use,  or  exhaustion,  measured  in  units  of  time.  This  concept  is  expressed  by  the 
following  equation: 


(M)  _  ^ 

(MfT) 

where  M  is  mass  and  T  is  time.  M  represents  the  supply  of  the  stock  resource  and  theoretically 
has  units  of  time.  However,  because  the  rate  of  production  of  stock  resources  covers  such  a  long 
time  span,  it  is  assumed  that  the  rate  of  production  is  zero. 

In  the  depletion  of  flow  resources  (e.g.,  forest  products  or  water),  two  attributes  must  be 
considered:  (1)  the  size  and  rate  of  consumption  of  the  resource  “pool”  and  (2)  the  rate  of 
replenishment  (both  natural  and  managed  replacement).  These  two  attributes  are  incorporated  in 
the  following  equation: 


(M) 

(M/T) 


+  (MTT)  =  (T) 


where  M  is  mass  and  T  is  time.  The  first  term  in  the  above  equation  could  be  used  as  a 
comparison  to  the  depletion  of  stock  resources  because  the  flow  resource  whose  current  rate  of 
consumption  is  greater  than  the  rate  of  replenishment  could  be  depleted  in  a  finite  period  of  time 


5-8 


if  not  redirected  by  management  intervention.  For  example,  over-harvesting  of  certain  species 
of  trees  (e.g.,  mahogany  in  tropical  forests),  where  the  rate  of  consumption  exceeds  the  rate  of 
replenishment,  will  result  in  the  depletion  of  the  resource  in  a  measurable  period  of  time. 

The  framework  for  a  resource  depletion  matrix  is  illustrated  in  Figure  5-2.  This  matrix  is 
divided  into  four  quadrants  based  on  four  categories  of  resources:  stock,  flow,  local,  and  global. 
The  cells  corresponding  to  stock  resources  yield  a  measure  of  the  time  until  the  resource  stock  is 
depleted.  The  cells  corresponding  to  flow  resources  provide  a  measure  of  resource  depletion, 
which  may  be  used  to  determine  the  sustainability  of  the  resource  use. 

Characterizing  flow  resources  is  somewhat  more  complicated  because  the  rate  of 
replenishment  must  be  considered.  In  addition,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  replenishment  of  a 
flow  resource  is  equal  in  quality  to  the  original  resource  pool.  For  instance,  although  old-growth 
forest  products  represent  a  viable  flow  resource,  replenishment  by  managed  replanting  will  not 
return  the  forest  to  its  original  level  of  value  or  quality — at  least  in  the  near  future. 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  using  the  resource  depletion  matrix  would  involve 
comparing  the  remaining  use  years  with  and  without  the  product  or  process  system,  or  with  and 
without  specified  alternatives.  In  addition,  any  evaluation  of  stock-resource  depletion  should 
consider  intergenerational  equity  or  social  welfare.  For  instance,  short-term  exhaustion  of  a 
stock  resource  would  place  a  higher  value  on  current  populations  than  future  populations.  The 
more  analytical  approach  used  in  this  resource  depletion  matrix  allows  for  a  clearer 
understanding  of  the  distinction  between  stock  and  flow  resources  at  the  local  and  global  scales 
and  provides  the  analyst  with  specific  units  for  measurement  of  resource  depletion.

CHAPTER  6 

METHODS  FOR  CONDUCTING  VALUATION 


The  valuation  phase  of  impact  assessment  involves  assigning  relative  values  or  weights 
to  impacts  based  on  their  associated  descriptors  as  derived  in  the  characterization  phase  and 
stakeholder  values.  The  primary  objective  of  this  valuation  exercise  is  to  integrate  information 
on  environmental  impacts  with  stakeholder  values  to  establish  the  relative  importance  of  impacts 
or  categories  of  impacts.  Thus  the  challenge  to  practitioners  is  to  adequately  capture  and  express 
to  decisionmakers  the  full  range  of  potential  impacts  relevant  to  the  LCA  and  to  the  stakeholders 
without  overwhelming  their  audience  with  information. 

Making  successful  decisions  based  on  impact  assessment  requires  considering  all 
assessment  results  and  technical  information.  In  addition,  decisions  are  not  solely  based  on  the 
precision  of  measurement  but  also  on  how  measurements  are  interpreted  in  terms  of  imprecisely 
understood  goals  and  values.  Although  developing  a  truly  objective  method  for  valuation  is  both 
impossible  and  inappropriate,  several  conceptual  and  methodological  approaches  to  valuation  do 
exist  Those  approaches  that  have  been  used,  presented,  or  discussed  in  the  context  of  LCA  are 
described  in  this  chapter.  In  addition  to  the  approaches  described  in  this  chapter,  several 
integrated  approaches,  as  discussed  in  Chapter  7,  also  contain  implicit  or  explicit  valuation 
components. 

6.1  DECISION  ANALYSIS  USING  MULTI- ATTRIBUTE  UTILITY  THEORY 

(MAUT) 

Simply  stated,  decision  analysis  is  a  method  that  breaks  down  complex  decisions 
involving  multiple  issues  into  constituent  parts  or  individual  attributes  to  provide  a  better 
understanding  of  the  main  factors  guiding  the  decision.  Decision  analysis  using  MAUT  is  useful 
when  deciding  between  largely  different  types  of  considerations.  In  addition,  it  provides  a 
logical  structure  for  analyzing  complex  weighting  issues. 

The  first  step  in  decision  analysis  is  to  identify  all  important  objectives  and  attributes. 
While  this  step  may  seem  obvious,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  valuation  focuses  on  the 
right  problem.  The  objectives  and  attributes  of  the  decision  at  hand  may  be  identified  by  using 
tools  such  as  an  objectives  hierarchy  (Keeney  and  Raiffa,  1976).  Developing  an  objectives 
hierarchy  may  proceed  in  either  a  top-down  or  bottom-up  fashion: 


6-1 


Top-down:  The  decisionmaker(s)  is  asked  to  identify  overall  objectives.  For 

LCA  these  might  be  to  minimize  overall  environmental  and  human 
health  impacts  or  to  maximize  public  opinion. 

Bottom-up:  An  exhaustive  list  of  specific  attributes  of  concern  to  the 

decisionmaker  is  initially  identified.  Items  in  the  initial  list  of 
attributes  may  then  be  aggregated,  eliminated,  or  redefined  in  the 
determination  of  a  final  set  of  attributes.  For  example,  an  initial  LCA 
attribute  list  might  include  acid  deposition  impacts,  solid  waste 
impacts,  corporate  image,  waste  disposal  cost  minimization,  etc.  The 
decisionmaker(s)  may  decide  that  acid  deposition  is  not  a  significant 
problem  in  the  region  and  thus  eliminate  it  from  the  list,  resulting  in  a 
streamlined  set  of  attributes. 

Whether  the  objectives  and  attributes  are  determined  through  a  top-down  or  bottom-up 
approach,  the  final  set  of  attributes  should  have  certain  characteristics.  An  overall  objective 
would  be  at  the  top  and  a  comprehensive  set  of  issue-specific  objectives  are  then  derived  that  are 
consistent  with  the  overall  objective.  Finally,  attributes  that  are  meaningful,  measurable,  and 
predictable  are  derived  for  each  specific  objective.  According  to  Keeney  and  Raiffa  (1976),  who 
describe  the  entire  MAUT  process  in  detail,  the  set  of  attributes  should  be 

•  comprehensive, 

•  as  small  as  possible  in  number, 

•  nonoverlapping, 

•  judgmentally  independent,  and 

•  operational. 

Decision  analysis  with  multiple  issues  or  objectives,  such  as  impact  assessment,  would 
include  the  following  steps: 

1.  Break  the  issue  or  decision  down  into  single  objectives  and  attributes. 

2.  Utilize  the  attributes  to  measure  the  degree  to  which  an  objective  is  achieved  by  a 
management  option  (attributes  should  be  relevant  to  the  issue,  measurable, 
predictable,  comprehensive,  and  nonoverlapping). 

3.  Identify  objectives  and  attributes  that  build  consensus  about  the  nature  of  the 
issue  at  hand. 

4.  Estimate  the  effects  of  various  actions  (decisions)  on  the  attributes. 


6-2 


An  example  decision  tree  outlining  objectives  and  measurable  attributes  of  water 
pollution  effects  as  part  of  the  overall  objective  of  environmental  improvement  is  shown  in 
Figure  6-1.  The  attributes  (e.g.,  predicted  effect  on  human  health)  as  shown  in  Figure  6-1 
provide  a  foundation  upon  which  analysts  can  estimate  the  effects  of  various  actions. 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  where  tradeoffs  between  impacts  to  ecosystems, 
human  health,  and  natural  resources  must  be  made,  employing  decision  analysis  does  not 
necessarily  require  following  the  above-outlined  steps.  Decision  analysis  in  impact  assessment 
would  likely  include  employing  a  model  to  predict  ecosystem,  human  health,  and  natural 
resource  impacts  and  associating  each  impact  with  a  unit  of  measure  or  value. 

Strengths 

The  multi-attribute  analysis  capabilities  of  MAUT  allow  for  an  evaluation  of  cross-sector 
and/or  multi-media  issues.  For  example,  in  using  comprehensive  environmental  assessment

techniques,  such  as  LCA,  decisionmakers  are  often  faced  with  decisions  that  can  cut  across 
multiple  environmental  media  (e.g.,  air  pollution,  water  pollution,  solid  waste,  resource  use). 
MAUT  provides  a  framework  for  breaking  such  multi-attribute  decisions  into  a  set  of 
measurable  attributes  from  which  the  analyst  can  develop  a  multi-attribute  utility  function.  This 
multi-attribute  utility  function  can,  under  favorable  conditions  (see  Keeney  and  Raiffa,  1976),  be 
broken  down  into  single  attribute  utility  functions,  which  can  then  be  combined  in  a 
multiplicative  or  additive  manner  according  to  the  values  of  estimated  scaling  coefficients 
(SETAC,  1993). 

Weaknesses 

The  primary  weakness  of  MAUT  is  that  it  is  very  difficult  to  implement  because  of  some 
of  the  following  characteristics: 

•  determination  of  the  appropriate  utility  function  to  employ, 

•  decomposition  of  the  multi-attribute  utility  function, 

•  derivation  and  use  of  multiplicative  functions  to  combine  the  single  attribute  utility 
functions,  and 

•  estimation  of  scaling  coefficients. 

Because  of  limiting  characteristics  such  as  those  listed  above,  the  MAUT  process  has 
been  simplified  and  refined  in  “spin-off’  methods  such  as  the  Analytic  Hierarchy  Process  (AHP) 
described  in  Section  6.2. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  MAUT  could  be  used  to  scale  predicted  impacts  on 
a  0  to  100  utility  scale,  multiplied  by  the  importance  weights,  summed,  and  then  compared  to 
identify  the  maximum  utility  management  strategy  (SETAC,  1993).  However,  the  subjective 
nature  of  the  scaling  process  is  open  to  considerable  debate,  and  analytic  difficulties  of  the 
scaling  process  may  limit  whether  scaling  may  be  accomplished  at  all.  Therefore,  the  most 
practical  application  of  MAUT  for  purposes  of  impact  assessment  may  be  for  decisionmakers  to 
consider,  separately,  the  importance  weights  and  the  impacts  evaluation  (SETAC,  1993). 

6.2  AHP 

The  AHP  is  a  systematic  procedure  for  demonstrating  a  problem  in  a  hierarchical 
structure,  based  on  the  values  of  the  decisionmaker(s).  The  AHP  organizes  basic  reasoning  by 


6-4 


decomposing  a  problem  into  its  constituent  parts  and  then  using  simple  pairwise  comparisons  to 
develop  priority  rankings  in  each  hierarchy. 

Steps  to  follow  when  using  the  AHP  are  described  below.  Particular  steps  may  be 
emphasized  more  in  some  situations  than  in  others,  and  as  noted,  interaction  is  generally 
necessary. 

1.  Define  the  problem  and  determine  what  you  want  to  know. 

2.  Structure  the  hierarchy  from  the  top  (the  objectives  from  a  general  viewpoint) 
through  the  intermediate  levels  (criteria  on  which  subsequent  levels  depend)  to 
the  lowest  level  (which  usually  is  a  list  of  the  alternatives). 

3.  Construct  a  set  of  pairwise  comparison  matrices  for  each  of  the  lower  levels — one 
matrix  for  each  element  in  the  level  immediately  above.  An  element  in  the  higher 
level  is  said  to  be  a  governing  element  for  those  in  the  lower  level.  In  a  complete 
simple  hierarchy,  every  element  in  the  lower  level  affects  every  element  in  the 
upper  level.  The  elements  in  the  lower  level  are  then  compared  to  one  another 
based  on  their  effects  on  the  governing  elements  above.  This  yields  a  square 
matrix  of  judgments.  The  pairwise  comparisons  are  made  based  on  which 
element  dominates  another.  These  judgments  are  then  expressed  as  integers.  If 
element  A  dominates  element  B,  then  the  whole  number  integer  (or  exact  value 
with  decimals  if  known)  is  entered  in  row  A,  column  B,  and  the  reciprocal 
(fraction)  is  entered  in  row  B,  column  A.  If  element  B  dominates  element  A,  the 
reverse  occurs. 

4.  N(n-)/2  judgments  are  required  to  develop  the  set  of  matrices  in  Step  3. 
(Reciprocals  are  automatically  assigned  in  each  pairwise  comparison.) 

5.  Having  made  all  pairwise  comparisons  and  having  entered  the  data,  the 
consistency  is  determined  using  the  eigen  value.  (Aw  =  1^^^  w  is  determined. 

The  consistency  index  uses  the  departure  of  1^^  from  n  compared  with 
corresponding  average  values  for  random  entries  to  yield  the  consistency  ratio 
CR). 

6.  Steps  3,  4,  and  5  are  performed  for  all  levels  and  clusters  in  the  hierarchy. 

7.  Hierarchical  composition  is  used  to  weight  the  eigen  vectors  by  the  weights  of  the 
criteria  and  the  sum  is  taken  over  all  weighted  eigen  vector  entries  corresponding 
to  those  in  the  next  lower  level  of  the  hierarchy. 

8.  The  consistency  of  the  entire  hierarchy  is  determined  by  multiplying  each 
consistency  index  by  the  priority  of  the  corresponding  criteria  and  adding  them 
together.  The  result  is  then  divided  by  the  same  type  of  expression  using  the 
random  entry  corresponding  to  the  dimensions  of  each  matrix  weighted  by  the 
priorities  as  before,  so  that  the  CR  is  about  10  percent  or  less.  If  the  CR  is  not  10 
percent  or  less,  the  quality  of  the  judgments  should  be  improved,  perhaps  by 


6-5 


revising  the  manner  in  which  questions  are  asked  in  making  pairwise 
comparisons.  If  this  fails  to  improve  consistency,  it  is  likely  that  the  problem 
should  be  more  accurately  structured  by  grouping  similar  elements  under  more 
meaningful  criteria.  A  return  to  Step  2  would  be  required,  although  only  the 
problematic  parts  of  the  hierarchy  may  need  revision. 

9.  To  perform  absolute  measurement  that  preserves  the  rank  of  the  alternatives  and 
satisfies  expectations  and  prior  commitments,  each  lowest  level  subcriterion  is 
divided  into  a  complete  set  of  intensities  so  that  an  alternative  always  reflects  one 
of  these  intensities.  Then  the  intensities  are  pairwise  compared  according  to 
perceived  importance  or  priority  with  respect  to  that  criterion.  Finally,  the 
alternatives  are  rated  one  at  a  time.  The  intensities  for  each  criterion  and  the 
weighted  ratings  are  added  to  obtain  an  overall  rank  on  a  ratio  scale.  Unlike 
paired  comparisons,  the  process  to  rate  intensities  requires  expert  knowledge.  In 
most  decision  problems  about  the  future,  there  is  no  such  expert  knowledge. 

Also,  experts  have  been  known  to  have  biased  and  misjudged  the  importance  of 
the  intensities.  In  such  cases  paired  comparisons  must  be  used  (Saaty,  1992). 

Applying  the  AHP  approach  to  the  valuation  phase  of  impact  assessment  is  relatively 
straightforward.  In  the  AHP  example  illustrated  in  Figure  6-2,  the  overall  goal  of  the  LCA 
(environmental  improvement)  is  at  the  top  of  the  hierarchy;  factors  affecting  this  goal  are  on  the 
next  level.  These  factors  would  probably  be  the  impact  descriptors  formed  in  the 
characterization  phase.  Subcriteria  at  the  next  level  might  include  economic  considerations, 
uncertainty,  assumptions,  judgments,  etc. 

Strengths 

The  main  strength  of  the  AHP  is  that  it  provides  an  efficient  framework  and  procedure 
for  making  individual  or  group  decisions  on  single  or  multiple  attribute  problems.  Some 
additional  strengths  of  the  AHP  include  the  following: 

•  relatively  simple  and  straightforward  to  use, 

•  available  AHP  computer  software  package  (called  Expert  Choice), 

•  overall  view  of  complex  relationships  inherent  in  multi-faceted  problems  and  in  the 
judgment  process,  and 

•  flexible  enough  to  handle  a  wide  variety  of  problem  types.

Weaknesses 

One  weakness  of  the  AHP  results  from  the  pairwise  comparison  process.  This  process 
requires  expert  knowledge  to  rate  the  intensities  (see  Step  9  in  the  AHP  process  outlined  above) 
of  the  attributes  being  compared.  In  the  case  of  most  future  problems,  there  is  no  such  expert 
knowledge.  In  addition,  the  possibility  exists  that  the  experts  can  have  a  bias  and/or  might 
misjudge  the  importance  of  particular  attribute  intensities.  At  any  rate,  because  of  its  reliance  on 
the  values  and  judgment  of  a  select  group  of  individuals,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  results  of  an  AHP 
study  could  be  replicated. 


6-7 


Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  AHP  may  provide  a  useful  tool  for  evaluating  multi-attribute,  complex  problems. 
Such  problems  typify  those  encountered  in  the  valuation  phase  of  impact  assessment  where, 
foreseeably,  a  wide  variety  of  multi-media  and/or  cross-sector  environmental  impacts  must  be 
considered.  The  AHP  also  provides  a  useful  framework  for  integrating  stakeholder  values  with 
environmental  impacts. 

6.3  MODIFIED  DELPHI  TECHNIQUE 

The  Delphi  Technique  is  a  procedure  originally  developed  by  the  Rand  Corporation  for 
eliciting  and  processing  the  opinions  of  a  group  of  experts  knowledgeable  in  the  various  areas 
involved.  The  Delphi  Technique  addresses  the  need  to  structure  a  group  communication  process 
to  obtain  a  useful  result  for  a  given  objective.  In  essence,  the  Delphi  Technique  attempts  to 
create  a  structured  format  to  elicit  collective  knowledge. 

In  response  to  a  number  of  shortcomings  associated  with  the  Delphi  Technique  (see 
Linstone  and  Turoff,  1975),  a  modified  Delphi  technique  has  been  developed.  This  modified 
Delphi  technique  provides  a  systematic  and  controlled  process  of  queuing  and  aggregating  the 
judgments  of  group  members  and  stresses  iteration  with  feedback  to  arrive  at  a  convergent 
consensus.  The  weighting  system  discussed  in  the  following  section  does  not  include  all  the 
elements  of  the  original  Delphi  Technique.  In  addition,  results  of  these  ranking  sessions  need 
further  study,  feedback,  and  substantive  input  from  field  data  before  using. 

The  weighting  procedure  can  be  simply  employed.  A  deck  of  cards  is  given  to  each 
person  participating  in  the  weighting.  In  this  example  each  card  names  a  different  technical 
specialty.  Each  of  the  participants  is  then  asked  to  rank  the  technical  specialties  according  to 
their  relative  importance  to  explaining  changes  in  the  environment  that  would  result  from  a 
particular  system.  Then  each  individual  is  asked  to  review  the  list  and  make  pairwise 
comparisons  between  technical  specialties,  beginning  with  the  most  important  specialty.  The 
most  important  technical  specialty  is  compared  with  the  next  important  specialty  by  each 
individual,  and  the  second  technical  specialty  with  respect  to  the  first.  For  example,  the  first 
technical  area  might  receive  a  weight  of  100  percent,  and  the  second  most  important  technical 
area  might  be  considered  only  90  percent  as  important  as  the  first.  The  second  and  third  most 
important  technical  specialties  are  compared,  and  the  third  most  important  is  assigned  a  number 
of — for  example,  95  percent — based  on  its  relative  importance  compared  to  the  second  most 
important  technical  specialty.  A  sample  diagram  of  the  comparison  is  presented  in  Figure  6-3.

the  e)^erience  and  judgment  of  the 
participant. 


Figure  6-3.  Modified  Delphi  Technique

The  formula  for  weighting  the  technical  specialties  is 


(i  =  1,2, 3,.. .,n) 


(i  =  1) 

(i  =  2,3,.. .,n) 


where 


Wjj  =  weight  for  the  ith  technical  specialty  area  by  the  jth  scientist, 
n  =  number  of  technical  specialties, 


6-9 


P  =  1,000:  total  number  of  points  to  be  distributed  among  the  technical  specialties, 

Xjj  =  the  jth  scientist’s  assessment  of  the  ratio  of  importance  of  the  ith  technical 

specialty  in  relation  to  the  (i-l)th  technical  specialties,  and 

Vjj  =  measure  of  relative  weight  for  the  ith  technical  specialty  area  by  the  jth 
scientist. 

To  accomplish  the  second  part  of  this  technique  (i.e.,  to  rank  attributes  within  a  technical 
specialty),  each  participant  or  group  independently  ranks  attributes  in  his  or  her  own  specialty. 
The  information  from  these  pairwise  comparisons  can  then  be  used  to  calculate  the  relative 
importance  of  each  of  these  specialty  areas;  a  fixed  number  of  points  (e.g.,  1,000)  is  distributed 
among  the  technical  specialties  according  to  individual  relative  importance. 

After  the  weights  are  calculated  from  the  first  round  of  this  procedure,  the  information 
about  the  relative  weights  is  presented  again  to  the  experts,  a  discussion  of  the  weights  ensues, 
and  a  second  round  of  pairwise  comparisons  is  made.  The  process  is  repeated  until  the  results 
become  relatively  stable  in  successive  rounds. 

In  a  demonstration  of  this  method,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  college  graduates  with 
very  little  training  was  asked  to  rate  the  following  areas  according  to  their  relative  importance  in 
environmental  impact  analysis  and  to  distribute  a  1,000-point  total  among  these  categories: 

•  air  quality 

•  ecology 

•  water  quality 

•  aesthetics 

•  economics 

•  transportation 

•  earth  science 

•  sociology 

•  natural  resources  and  energy 

•  health  science 

•  land  use 

•  noise 


6-10 


After  a  thorough  group  study  of  all  12  areas,  the  group  was  asked  to  rate  the  areas  again. 
The  results,  shown  in  Table  6-1,  indicate  that  although  some  relative  priorities  changed,  the 
points  allocated  to  each  category  remained  essentially  the  same.  Similar  ratings  may  be 
developed  for  attributes  within  each  group. 

Strengths 

This  modified  Delphi  technique  provides  a  systematic  and  controlled  process  of  queuing 
and  aggregating  the  judgments  of  group  members  and  stresses  iteration  with  feedback  to  arrive 
at  a  convergent  consensus.  Attributes  within  a  technical  specialty  are  ranked  by  an  expert  in  that 
technical  specialty  and  aggregated  over  the  expert  panel,  thereby  creating  a  structure  for  ranking 
alternative  impact  areas  (see  Table  6-1).

Weaknesses 


One  of  the  weaknesses  of  the  modified  Delphi  technique  is  one  that  typically  plagues 
most  valuation  tools — namely  the  requirement  of  expert  knowledge  with  which  to  rate 
environmental  attributes.  In  many  cases,  there  is  no  such  expert  knowledge.  In  addition,  the 
possibility  exists  that  the  experts  can  have  a  bias  and/or  may  misjudge  the  importance  of 
particular  attribute  intensities. 

Another  weakness  of  the  modified  Delphi  technique  is  in  the  ranking  process.  This 
process  requires  a  wide  variety  of  technical  specialists  to  rank  attributes  within  their  respective 
technical  specialty  area.  In  addition,  the  results  of  the  ranking  sessions  may  require  further 
study,  feedback,  and  substantive  input  from  field  data  before  using.  Conceivably,  a  large 
amount  of  time  and  resources  could  be  spent  on  such  follow-up  analysis. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  information  generated  from  the  modified  Delphi  technique  may  provide  a  useful 
procedure  for  calculating  the  relative  importance  of  each  specialty  (i.e.,  environmental  attributes 
or  impacts)  area.  From  this,  a  fixed  number  of  points  (e.g.,  1,000)  may  be  distributed  among  the 
technical  specialties,  thus  indicating  the  relative  importance  of  individual  specialty  areas. 
However,  the  level  of  technical  expertise  and  time  required  to  conduct  a  thorough  evaluation  of 
each  specialty  area  may  limit  the  application  of  the  modified  Delphi  technique  to  valuation. 

6.4  LIFE-CYCLE  COSTING* 

A  life-cycle  inventory  would  address  environmental  inputs  and  outputs  of  a  production 
system,  while  the  impact  assessment  would  address  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with 
those  inputs  and  outputs.  Life-cycle  costing  extends  impact  assessment  by  taking  an  additional 
step  (i.e.,  placing  a  dollar  value  on  impacts).  Methods  for  assigning  costs  are  described  below. 

Monetary  values  for  environmental  impacts  can  be  determined  for  certain  types  of 
impacts.  The  market  value,  for  instance,  of  crop  loss  or  damages  caused  by  air  pollutants  can  be 
valued  directly  by  assessing  the  market  value  of  the  lost  output.  However,  quantifying  an  impact 
chain  leading  to  revenue  loss  may  be  difficult.  For  example,  translating  emissions  from  the 
production  of  a  glass  bottle  into  an  incremental  change  in  ambient  ozone  concentration,  and 
quantifying  crop  loss  from  that  increment  is  highly  uncertain.  In  addition,  placing  monetary 


^Portions  of  this  section  were  summarized  from  White  et  al.  (forthcoming). 


6-12 


values  on  many  impacts  (e.g.,  adverse  human  health  effects)  is  difficult  from  an  economic  and 
ethical  perspective. 

For  the  purpose  of  analysis,  different  types  of  value  that  individuals  place  on  the 
environment  have  been  distinguished:  use  value,  option  value,  and  existence  value.  Use  value  is 
based  on  the  utility  people  derive  from  the  “consumption”  of  the  environment  for  recreational 
purposes,  such  as  boating,  fishing,  and  other  sporting  activities.  The  option  value  is  the  use 
value  in  the  presence  of  uncertainty.  People  may  not  consume  the  environment  at  present  but 
may  want  to  do  so  in  the  future.  Having  the  option  for  future  use  is  assumed  to  be  valued  by 
consumers.  Finally,  the  existence  value  is  the  value  people  assign  to  the  environment  for 
“altruistic”  reasons;  it  is  the  utility  they  derive  from  the  knowledge  of  the  existence  of  the 
environment. 

Several  methods  are  available  for  indirectly  valuing  impacts  by  estimating  the  use, 
option,  and/or  existence  values  that  individuals  place  on  environmental  amenities  or  the 
devaluation  resulting  from  environmental  harm.  These  methods  involve  the  following: 

1)  examining  behavioral  responses  that  are,  or  might  be,  influenced  by  an  externality; 

2)  assuming  or  creating  a  fictitious  market  to  elicit  the  value  that  individuals  might  assign  to  an 
externality;  or  3)  analyzing  the  implicit  value  placed  on  pollution  abatement  by  society  through 
the  actions  of  its  regulatory  agencies.  Methods  in  each  of  these  three  categories  are  briefly 
described  below.  For  detailed  descriptions  of  these  methods  and  their  corresponding  strengths 
and  weaknesses,  the  reader  is  referred  to  White  et.  al.  (Forthcoming),  Tellus  Institute  (1992a, 
1992b,  1992c),  Desvouges  et  al.  (1991  and  1989),  and  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co¬ 
operation  and  Development  (OECD)  (1989). 

Strengths 

One  of  the  main  strengths  of  life-cycle  costing  is  that  the  basis  for  measurement  (i.e., 
dollars)  is  a  metric  that  most  people  can  readily  understand.  Monetary  values  for  environmental 
attributes  also  enable  analysts  and  decisionmakers  to  directly  compare  environmental  and 
economic  considerations,  whereas  environmental  and  economic  decisionmaking  have  generally 
been  treated  as  separate,  unrelated  entities. 

Another  strength  of  life-cycle  costing  is  that  the  valuation  methods  and  techniques  have 
been  refined  over  a  long  period  of  time,  are  applicable  to  a  wide  variety  of  impact  types,  and 
offer  much  practical  experience  for  analysts  to  draw  upon.

Weaknesses 


Life-cycle  costing  is  open  to  criticism  for  using  economic  valuation  methods  to  “price” 
environmental  attributes  (e.g.,  the  extinction  of  species,  loss  of  pristine  forest  habitat,  or  adverse 
human  health  effects).  For  example,  a  comprehensive  estimate  of  society’s  willingness  to  accept 
the  loss  of  the  spotted  owl  in  the  Western  United  States  can  easily  surpass  the  GNP  of  most,  if 
not  all,  countries.  Some  additional  criticisms  of  using  monetary  values  to  assess  environmental 
impacts  are  the  following: 

•  large  gap  between  rich  and  poor  in  terms  of  disposable  resources  for  environmental 
care, 

•  needs  of  today  often  outweigh  the  needs  for  tomorrow, 

•  insufficient  knowledge  to  value  environmental  impacts  because  the  full  consequences 
of  impacts  are  not  fully  understood,  and 

•  monetary  valuation  focuses  on  human  needs. 

In  addition,  methods  of  life-cycle  costing  often  rely  on  a  set  of  assumptions  that  may  or 
may  not  accurately  reflect  reality.  Some  of  these  assumptions  are  outlined  in  the  discussion  of 
specific  methods  below. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

Life-cycle  costing  methods  may  be  useful  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment  for 
translating  impacts  into  a  common  metric  (i.e.,  dollars)  for  direct  comparison  of  impacts  within 
and  between  impact  categories.  The  presentation  of  impacts  in  monetary  terms  also  can 
facilitate  decisionmakers’  consideration  of  tradeoffs  between  environmental  and  economic 
issues. 


One  integrated  approach  to  impact  assessment — the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  Method 
outlined  in  Chapter  7 — provides  an  example  of  the  use  of  economic  valuation  in  the  context  of 
LCA. 

6.4.1  Hedonic  Pricing 

Hedonic  pricing  attempts  to  identify  a  surrogate  for  the  nonexistent  market  for  the 
environment.  Markets  that  qualify  as  surrogate  markets  for  the  environment  are  those  in  which  a 
private  good  is  traded  that  may  bear  some  relationship  to  the  public  environmental  good.  The 
notion  underlying  the  concept  of  hedonic  prices  is  that  people  derive  utility  from  various 


6-14 


attributes  of  a  product.  A  product  has  many  attributes,  some  of  which  can  relate  to  the  presence 
of  a  public  good.  A  house,  for  example,  can  have  features  individual  consumers  value 
differently.  Each  of  these  common  features  commands  a  price;  however,  this  price  is  implicit: 
individual  features  of  a  house  are  not  sold  separately.  One  attribute  of  the  house  is  the 
environment  in  which  it  is  located. 

In  theory,  one  can  construct  demand  functions  that  depend  on  these  individual 
characteristics,  and  one  can  derive  the  amount  of  money  consumers  are  willing  to  spend  to 
obtain  one  more  unit  of  q,  the  environmental  quality  feature.  (If  q  is  air  quality,  then  “one  more 
unit  of  q”  would  refer  to  “one  unit  less  of  pollutant,”  where  the  “pollutant”  could  refer  to  an 
index  of  air  pollution.)  One  would  expect  to  observe  differentials  in  housing  prices,  depending 
on  the  quality  of  the  specific  environment  in  which  they  are  located. 

The  notion  of  a  good  embodying  many  characteristics  implies  that  a  job,  too,  has  many 
characteristics  in  addition  to  the  wage  that  it  pays.  One  important  characteristic  is  the  risk  to  the 
health  and  life  of  the  worker.  It  is  argued  that  workers  will  only  accept  a  job  with  high  risk 
when  given  a  “compensating  wage  differential.”  The  hedonic  wage  method  relates  the  size  of 
wage  differentials  for  various  jobs  to  their  lives. 

For  this  approach  to  measure  what  it  intends  to  measure,  several  assumptions  must  be 
made  pertaining  to  the  aggregability  of  individual  preferences  (see  OECD,  1989).  In  addition,  it 
is  subject  to  many  sources  of  bias  (see  OECD,  1989),  for  example,  strategic  bias.  Because 
environmental  quality  is  a  public  good  (once  it  is  provided,  people  cannot  be  excluded  from  its 
consumption),  people  have  an  incentive  to  understate  their  preference  (if  they  are  held  to  pay), 
counting  on  the  fact  that  other  people  will  provide  for  the  supply  of  the  good.  This  is  the  free¬ 
rider  problem.  Also  several  sources  of  bias  are  based  on  individual  rationality.  It  has  been 
observed  that  people  respond  to  the  starting  value  that  is  quoted  to  them  (source  for  the  “starting 
point  bias”).  In  addition,  there  is  also  concern  about  whether  the  hypothetical  markets 
correspond  well  enough  to  real  markets. 

Apart  from  various  technical  problems  (see  OECD,  1989),  the  obvious  flaw  of  this 
approach  is  that  it  only  targets  the  value  of  an  area  for  a  very  specific  narrow  use.  Surely  people 
value  natural  resources  for  more  than  the  amenities  they  offer.  And  again,  there  is  no  way  this 
method  would  allow  the  contribution  of  a  single  pollutant  to  environmental  degradation  to  be 
evaluated. 


6-15 


The  derivation  of  an  implicit  price  for  an  environmental  characteristic  from  an  ideal  type 
demand  function  is  rarely  a  straightforward  calculation.  Estimating  these  implicit  processes 
from  observable  market  data,  however,  requires  strong  assumptions  and  is  not  without  problems. 
Apart  from  the  usual  assumptions  about  the  structure  of  individual  utility  functions  relating  to 
aggregability,  it  has  to  be  assumed  that  people  have  a  wide  enough  array  of  choices  to  make  their 
decisions  on  the  basis  of  all  characteristics.  This  is  obviously  hardly  ever  the  case.  Often,  one 
characteristic  overrides  all  others;  proximity  to  the  place  of  work  often  takes  this  role.  People  do 
not  usually  have  a  choice  about  where  they  find  work;  thus,  they  may  move  into  an  environment 
that  they  would  not  move  into  otherwise. 

Another  problem  is  that  finding  a  sample  with  sufficient  variation  (i.e.,  enough  houses 
that  exhibit  different  characteristics)  is  not  easy.  The  specific  environment  of  houses  varies 
together  with  other  factors,  and  it  is  very  hard  to  isolate  the  influence  of  one  variable  when  they 
vary  together.  And,  as  stated  above,  in  the  absence  of  a  wide  array  of  choices,  people  are  likely 
to  base  their  decisions  on  characteristics  other  than  the  environment. 

One  problem  with  this  method  is  that  it  presupposes  information  about  job  characteristics 
on  the  part  of  workers  and  researchers.  Workers  often  do  not  have  sufficient  information  about 
the  risks  to  their  health  and  life  posed  by  their  jobs.  Also,  unless  a  job  exposes  one  to  specific 
pollutants,  establishing  a  worker’s  dislike  for  a  specific  pollutant  is  not  possible.  This  method 
also  involves  the  problem  of  measurement.  Data  on  specific  pollution  at  work  are  not  readily 
available;  data  usually  only  exist  on  the  consequences  of  hazards,  such  as  accidents,  morbidity, 
and  mortality.  Hedonic  wage  studies  would  be  more  useful  in  damage  cost  studies  if  they  could 
indicate  the  value  that  people  ascribe  to  their  lives. 

6.4.2  Contingent  Valuation 

Contingent  valuation  assumes  hypothetical  (contingent)  markets.  In  essence,  it  consists 
of  experiments  in  which  people  are  asked  to  express  their  valuation  for  a  specific  environmental 
commodity.  These  experiments  can  be  designed  as  bidding  games,  questionnaires,  and  so  forth 
(see  Freeman,  1982  and  Mitchell  and  Carson,  1991). 

Understanding  the  change  in  environmental  conditions  consumers  are  asked  to  evaluate  is 
important.  Two  concepts  are  suggested  in  the  literature:  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  and 
willingness  to  accept  (WTA).  Lx)osely  speaking,  the  former  is  the  amount  of  money  a  consumer 
would  be  willing  to  spend  to  secure  an  environmental  benefit,  and  the  latter  is  the  compensation 
that  the  consumer  would  demand  to  accept  an  environmental  cost.  However,  both  concepts  can 


6-16 


be  applied  to  similar  changes  in  environmental  conditions.  For  example,  consider  a  policy  to 
clean  up  90  percent  of  sulfur  oxides  emissions.  WTP  then  is  the  maximum  amount  of  money  an 
individual  would  give  away  to  have  90  percent  of  the  sulfur  oxides  emissions  abated,  while 
maintaining  his  or  her  utility  level,  and  WTA  is  the  amount  of  money  he  or  she  would  have  to  be 
given  to  accept  the  pollution  while  maintaining  the  utility  level  corresponding  to  the  absence  of 
90  percent  of  the  present  pollution. 

Economic  theory  suggests  that  these  two  values  do  not  really  differ.  However,  empirical 
studies  assessing  the  magnitude  of  WTA  versus  WTP  have  consistently  produced  far  greater 
amounts  for  WTA  than  for  WTP.  There  has  been  ongoing  discussion  about  this  apparent 
discrepancy.  It  was  long  known  that  the  greater  the  difference  between  WTA  and  WTP,  the 
greater  the  income  elasticity  of  demand.  WTP  is  obviously  limited  by  an  income  constraint, 
whereas  WTA  is  not. 

6.4.3  Cost  of  Control  Valuation 

The  cost  of  control  valuation  method  enjoys  increasing  popularity  as  utility  companies 
attempt  to  internalize  the  environmental  cost  of  energy  production.  Some  states  (e.g.,  California, 
Massachusetts,  Nevada,  New  York,  Wisconsin,  Oregon)  have  proposed  or  adopted  this  approach 
to  incorporate  the  environmental  costs  of  electricity  production  into  their  energy  planning 
processes. 

This  approach  infers  that  the  cost  society  attributes  to  pollution  may  be  derived  from 
government  regulations  for  specific  pollutants.  Complying  with  standards  set  for  pollutant 
emission  is  costly;  thus,  there  must  be  a  perceived  benefit  to  pollution  abatement.  Two  concepts 
are  central  to  this  approach:  the  marginal  cost  of  pollution  abatement  and  the  marginal  benefit 
of  pollution  abatement. 

•  Marginal  Cost  of  Pollution  Abatement  is  an  increasing  function  of  the  amount  of 
pollutant  being  controlled.  Increasing  marginal  cost  also  means  that  the  unit  cost  of 
abatement  (the  cost  of  abatement  per  unit  of  pollutant)  rises  as  more  and  more  pollution 
is  abated.  To  remove  the  fu'st  unit  of  pollutant,  one  would  choose  the  cheapest 
technology  available.  The  most  expensive  technology  would  only  be  employed  if  the 
potential  of  cheaper  technologies  was  exhausted. 

•  Marginal  Benefit  of  Pollutant  Abatement  is  a  decreasing  function  of  the  amount  of 
pollutant  being  removed.  For  example,  the  benefit  from  preventing  one  more  ton  of 
SO2  to  enter  the  atmosphere  is  smaller  the  more  SO2  has  already  been  controlled.  The 


6-17 


negative  side  of  this  relationship  is  that  the  marginal  damage  function  of  pollution  is 
generally  increasing;  that  is,  the  damage  that  one  unit  of  pollutant  causes  is  greater,  the 
higher  the  overall  pollution  levels. 

The  optimal  emission  standard  for  a  particular  pollutant  is  that  level  of  pollutant  at  which 
the  marginal  cost  of  abatement  equals  the  marginal  benefit  of  abatement.  Setting  such  a  standard 
would  require  an  efficient  allocation  of  resources  for  pollution  abatement  activity.  To  do  more 
would  cost  society  more  than  the  benefits  that  would  result  from  implementing  the  standard. 

Several  problems  are  associated  with  the  pollution  abatement  approaches  described 
above.  First,  no  emission  standard  exists  for  each  individual  pollutant.  Controls — not 
standards — are  administered  for  some  pollutants;  others  are  not  regulated  at  all.  Controls  present 
the  problem  of  “joint  cost  of  pollution  control”:  where  several  pollutants  causing  different 
environmental  impacts  can  be  captured  with  one-and-the-same  device.  The  problem  lies  in  how 
the  cost  of  that  device  should  be  allocated  to  individual  pollutants.  In  addition,  a  value  for  the 
pollutant  the  device  is  intended  to  capture  can  only  be  inferred  because  the  regulation  implies  a 
certain  value  for  this  pollutant. 

Another  problem  is  that  regulations  for  all  pollutants  may  not  exist.  A  case  in  point  is 
the  emission  of  greenhouse  gases.  One  could  value  the  costs  of  these  emissions  through  the 
costs  of  the  measures  that  would  offset  the  emissions  (e.g.,  afforestation).  It  also  seems 
legitimate  to  assume  that  society  holds  consistent  preferences,  and  that  for  some  pollutants, 
regulations  addressing  different  but  similar  ones  can  be  used.  For  example,  the  banning  of  lead 
acid  batteries  from  incinerators  reveals  the  regulator’s  (representing  society’s)  preference  that 
heavy  metals  should  not  be  emitted.  It  seems  legitimate  to  assume  a  regulation  banning  other 
heavy-metal  products  of  similar  toxicity.

CHAPTER  7 

INTEGRATED  METHODS  FOR  IMPACT  ASSESSMENT 


Integrated  methods  have  been  developed,  or  are  being  developed,  to  include  some 
combination  of  classification,  characterization,  and/or  valuation  activities  of  impact  assessment. 
This  chapter  profiles  some  of  these  integrated  methods.  Some  of  these  methods  integrate  data 
developed  from  an  inventory  analysis  with  expert  decision  or  economic  valuation  methods  to 
yield  information  that  is  relevant  to  not  only  environmental  decisionmaking  but  also  to  overall 
business  decisionmaking,  which  includes  a  number  of  factors  (e.g.,  profitability,  product  quality) 
in  addition  to  environmental  performance. 

7.1  IMPACT  ANALYSIS  MATRIX  (lAM) 

The  lAM  is  an  exploratory,  qualitative,  expert-based  approach  to  impact  analysis  that 
builds  on  the  results  of  an  inventory  analysis.  The  LAM  approach  is  described  below  by 
explaining  its  development  and  initial  use. 

The  lAM  approach  was  developed  as  part  of  a  broader  assessment  of  source-reduction 
potential  for  halogenated  solvents,  which  included  an  assessment  of  alternatives  to  such  solvents 
in  specific  applications.  The  lAM  allowed  for  the  direct  evaluation  of  the  relative  environmental 
burdens  of  a  particular  application  of  a  halogenated  solvent  and  its  altemative(s)  and  made  the 
tradeoffs  between  them  explicit.  Two  specific  applications  involving  substitution  systems  for 
TCA  (1.1.1-trichloroethane)  were  evaluated: 

•  substitution  of  a  caustic  aqueous  cleaner  for  TCA  vapor  cleaning  of  metal  parts  and 

•  substitution  of  supercritical  CO2  paint  spraying  for  TCA-based  paint  spraying. 

Comparisons  of  these  two  TCA  substitute  systems  were  conducted  on  two  different 
levels:  user  (or  shop)  level  and  global  level.  User-level  impacts  referred  to  ecosystem  impacts 
that  emanated  from  a  boundary  drawn  around  a  particular  facility  using  the  TCA  substitute 
system.  For  example,  only  waste  disposal  activities  associated  with  using  the  substitute  were 
considered.  Global-level  impacts  took  into  account  all  of  the  traditional  life-cycle  stages, 
including  raw  materials  acquisition,  manufacturing,  use/reuse/maintenance,  and  recycle/waste 
management.  Analysis  at  these  two  levels  allowed  for  identifying  additional  tradeoffs  between 
the  two  systems.  That  is,  it  allowed  options  that  appeared  favorable  from  the  user’s  point  of 
view  but  unfavorable  from  a  global  point  of  view,  or  vice  versa,  to  be  identified  and  evaluated. 


7-1 


The  lAM  process  entails  convening  a  group  of  experts  to  carry  out  the  following  steps: 

1.  Identify  appropriate  impact  categories.  The  lAM  study  of  the  two  TCA 
substitutes  consisted  of  five  columns  of  inventory  data  (inputs  and  outputs)  and 
seven  rows  of  ecosystem  impact  categories.  These  impact  categories  were 
selected  by  expert  judgment  and  included 

•  global  warming 

•  ozone  depleting  potential 

•  nonrenewable  resource  utilization 

•  air  quality 

•  water  quality 

•  land  disposal 

•  transportation  effects 

(It  should  be  noted  that  in  applying  the  lAM  approach  in  other  settings,  impact 
categories  that  match  the  particular  characteristics  of  each  comparison  should  be 
used.  The  identification  and  exclusion  of  various  impact  categories  should  be 
transparent  and  sufficient  justification  should  be  provided.) 

2.  Determine  which  cells  in  the  lAM  represent  either  double  counting  or 
meaningless  comparisons.  For  instance,  in  the  case  of  the  two  TCA  substitutes  it 
was  determined  that  aqueous  wastes  had  no  significant  impact  on  global 
warming;  thus  the  corresponding  cell  in  the  lAM  was  eliminated.  As  a  result  of 
this  step,  17  of  the  35  LAM  cells  were  eliminated. 

3.  Assign  unweighted  “scores”  to  each  viable  cell  in  the  LAM.  Scores  for  the  TCA 
study  were  assigned  in  relation  to  a  particular  option  chosen  as  the  base.  In  this 
study,  a  was  used  to  signify  a  larger  ecosystem  impact  than  the  base  option 
(TCA),  and  a  was  used  to  signify  a  lesser  impact.  A  “0”  can  be  used  to 
signify  little  or  no  perceived  difference  in  impact.  Determination  of  scores  was 
based  on  a  combination  of  life-cycle  inventory  data  and  expert  knowledge  of 
associated  ecosystem  impacts. 

4.  (Optional).  Apply  weights  to  the  initial  unweighted  scores  to  determine  if  the 

results  will  change  significantly.  The  weighting  scheme  used  in  the  TCA  study 
assigned  a  to  relatively  strong  ecosystem  impacts  and  a  “ — ”  to  relatively 

large  reductions  in  impact. 

(It  should  be  noted  that  the  weighting  may  or  may  not  be  restricted  to  a  single 
impact  category,  depending  on  the  views  of  the  expert  panel.  However,  the  basis 
for  assigning  weights  and  the  scope  of  comparison  within  and  across  impact 
categories  should  be  made  transparent.) 


7-2 


5. 


Sum  the  individual  cell  scores  (pluses  and  minuses)  to  derive  overall  scores  for 
each  row  and  column  and,  if  appropriate,  for  the  entire  matrix.  Unweighted 
scores  in  the  TCA  substitute  lAM  ranged  from  +18  to  -18,  and  weighted  scores 
ranged  from  +36  to  -36. 

Table  7-1  shows  data  gathered  for  the  two  TCA  substitutes.  For  each  substitute,  the  data 
were  broken  down  into  user-level  and  global-level  items.  The  corresponding  lAMs  for  the  TCA 
substitutes  are  shown  in  Figures  7-1  and  7-2.  As  an  example  of  the  type  of  information  that  may 
be  derived  from  the  lAM  approach,  compare  and  contrast  the  scores  in  the  energy-inputs  column 
evaluated  at  the  user  versus  the  global  levels.  From  the  perspective  of  the  user,  impacts  derived

from  energy  input  requirements  were  a  dominating  category  and  were  much  higher  for  the 
aqueous  substitute  relative  to  the  TCA  system  because  of  the  high  pumping  and  heating 
requirements  of  the  aqueous  substitute.  In  contrast,  global-level  impacts  derived  from  energy 
requirements  were  found  to  be  essentially  the  same  for  the  two  systems. 

Strengths 

The  lAM  is  relatively  simple  and  convenient  to  use,  is  flexible  enough  to  account  for  a 
wide  variety  of  impacting  parameters  (i.e.,  life-cycle  components)  and  environmental  impact 
categories,  and  can  be  used  at  different  levels  of  analysis  (e.g.,  global  versus  shop  level).  The 
LAM  also  does  not  require  any  additional  data  beyond  that  which  is  generated  in  the  inventory 
analysis  and  uses  a  relatively  objective  technique  (i.e.,  less  is  better)  to  evaluate  the  associated 
environmental  consequences. 

Weaknesses 

One  weakness  of  the  lAM  is  that  it  does  not  measure  impacts.  Appropriate  impact 
categories  are  chosen  by  expert  judgment,  and  inventory  items  from  two  alternatives  are  merely 
compared  according  to  a  “less  is  better”  ranking  for  their  contribution  to  their  associated  impact 
categories.  However,  this  process  does  not  provide  insight  into  how  impact  categories  relate  to 
one  another.  For  example,  in  Figure  7-2  both  the  totals  for  global  warming  and  nonrenewable 
resource  are  -1.  From  this,  the  reduction  in  global  warming  and  nonrenewable  resource  use 
appear  to  be  “equal”  from  the  use  of  aqueous  cleaners.  However,  the  method  does  not  indicate, 
for  example,  how  better  or  worse  a  1-ton  reduction  in  global  warming  gases  is  compared  to  a 
1-ton  reduction  in  nonrenewable  resource  use. 

One  possible  variation  to  the  lAM  matrix  that  may  help  to  better  express  the  relationship 
of  impact  categories  to  one  another  is  the  Leopold  interaction  matrix.  The  cells  in  the  Leopold 
interaction  matrix  contain  the  ratio  of  the  magnitude  of  impact  (M)  to  the  importance  of  the 
impact  (I).  M  expresses  the  extensiveness  or  scale  of  the  impact,  and  I  expresses  the  importance 
of  the  impact  (to  stakeholders).  The  basic  framework  for  the  Leopold  interaction  matrix  is 
shown  in  Table  7-2.

Scale  Ranges:  M  -  1  to  10  1  =  lowest  magnitude  of  impact,  or  lowest  level  of  importance. 

I  -  1  to  10  10  =  highest  magnitude  of  impact,  or  highest  level  of  importance. 


Another  weakness  of  the  lAM  is  that  its  use  in  a  noncomparative  study,  which  includes 
only  a  single  set  of  data  from  one  alternative  and  no  set  of  data  against  which  to  evaluate  the 
alternative,  is  not  clear.  For  example,  in  the  case  study  example  outlined  above,  an  lAM  for 
aqueous  cleaning  alone  would  be  meaningless  without  the  baseline  of  vapor  cleaning  against 
which  to  compare  aqueous  cleaning.  With  just  one  set  of  data,  the  lAM  could  possibly  be 
modified  to  provide  a  general  indication  of  the  impact  categories  and/or  impacting  parameters 
that  are  most  significantly  affected.  In  this  case  the  pluses  and  minuses  in  the  matrix  cells  would 
be  used  to  represent  the  relative  significance  of  particular  impact  categories  or  impacting 
parameters. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  lAM  approach  may  provide  a  relatively  simple,  quick,  and  useful  means  of 
qualitatively  comparing  the  environmental  implications  of  two  or  more  alternative  systems 
without  having  to  characterizing  impacts.  The  more  qualitative  nature  of  the  lAM  would  make 
it  more  appropriate  for  internal  applications  or  as  a  screening  tool  to  identify  impact  categories 
or  life-cycle  components  that  require  a  more  detailed  level  of  assessment.

7.2  THE  EPS  ENVIRO-ACCOUNTING  METHOD 

Prepared  for  the  Swedish  Environmental  Research  Institute,  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting 
method  describes  impacts  on  the  environment  in  terms  of  one  or  several  safeguard  subjects  using 
the  EPS  method  described  in  Chapter  4  and  then  places  a  value  on  changes  in  the  safeguard 
subjects  according  to  the  WTP  to  restore  them  to  their  normal  status. 

The  five  safeguard  subjects  included  in  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  method  are  the 
following: 

•  human  health, 

•  biodiversity, 

•  production, 

•  resources,  and 

•  aesthetic  values  (Swedish  Waste  Research  Council,  1992). 

Impacts  are  characterized  and  valued  on  a  relative  scale  using  ELUs  according  to  the 
WTP  for  avoiding  negative  effects  on  the  safeguard  subjects.  Environmental  indices  are  then 
calculated  for  the  materials  and  processes  being  studied.  Background  information  is  derived 
from  LCA-based  inventories  of  the  materials  and  processes  under  review.  The  values  are  not 
absolute  figures  but  rather  points  of  reference  for  further  analysis  and  refinement. 

Environmental  impact  valuation  is  described  as  a  subjective  matter  that  can  be  given  some 
degree  of  objectivity  by  studying  decisions  made  in  society  or  by  surveying  people’s  opinions. 
Contingent  valuation  is  cited  as  a  method  for  generating  a  relative  rating  of  various 
environmental  effects.  Contingent  valuation  is  used  in  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  approach  to 
determine  individuals’  WTP  to  avoid  certain  environmental  effects.  To  date,  EPS  indices  for  a 
wide  range  of  environmental  impacts  have  been  developed  using  such  WTP  figures. 

The  output  from  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  system  is  a  value,  based  on  a  common 
metric,  for  different  environmental  impacts.  The  value  may  be  broken  down  into  its  individual 
components  for  further  analysis,  and  the  user  can  determine  the  level  of  detail  desired. 

Strengths 

The  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  method  is  strong  in  that  it  accounts  for  a  wide  variety  of 
impacts  within  five  main  impact  categories:  human  health,  biodiversity,  production,  resources, 
and  aesthetic  values.  Impacts  within  and  between  these  main  categories  are  characterized  and 
valued  on  a  relative  scale  allowing  for  a  direct  relative  comparison  of  impacts.  In  addition,  the 


7-7 


information  required  in  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  methods  is  derived  from  LCA-based 
inventories  and  readily  available  environmental  valuation  studies. 

Weaknesses 

One  weakness  of  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  method  is  that  environmental  impact 
valuation  is  a  highly  subjective  matter.  Although  monetary  units  provide  an  easily  understood 
value  metric,  using  monetary  values  to  assess  environmental  impacts  has  been  criticized  for 
several  reasons: 

•  a  large  gap  exists  between  rich  and  poor  in  terms  of  disposable  resources  for 
environmental  care, 

•  the  needs  of  today  often  outweigh  the  needs  for  tomorrow, 

•  insufficient  knowledge  exists  to  value  environmental  impacts  because  the  full 
consequences  of  impacts  are  not  fully  understood,  and 

•  monetary  valuation  focuses  on  human  needs. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

Because  the  EPS  Enviro-Accounting  method  was  developed  in  the  context  of  LCA,  it  is 
readily  applicable  for  impact  assessment.  The  five  safeguard  subjects  may  be  used  to  categorize 
inventory  items  into  impacts  categories,  and  environmental  valuation  studies  using  WTP  may  be 
used  to  estimate  costs  and  develop  coefficients  expressing  the  relative  environmental  impact  (in 
economic  terms)  of  alternative  items.  However,  environmental  valuation  studies  are  sometimes 
controversial  in  their  own  field  of  economic  research.  The  use  of  such  valuation  studies  and/or 
techniques  for  impact  assessment  may  be  similarly  problematic. 

7.3  INTEGRATED  MANUFACTURING  AND  DESIGN  INITIATIVE  (IMDI) 

ENVIRONMENTALLY  CONSCIOUS  MANUFACTURING  (ECM)  LIFE-CYCLE 

ANALYSIS 

As  part  of  a  Sandia  National  Laboratory  program,  IMDI  selected  Department  of  Energy 
(DOE)  stakeholders  (e.g.,  designers,  manufacturers.  Environmental  Safety  and  Health  personnel, 
environmental  technology  staff,  industry,  EPA,  and  academicians)  and  surveyed  them  to 
establish  a  basis  for  defining  environmental  impact  metrics.  A  panel  discussion  was  also 
conducted.  The  survey  asked  for  two  primary  responses: 

1)  “Identify  environmental  impacts  of  activities  related  to  manufacturing,  use  and 
disposal;’’  and 


7-8 


2) 


list  the  criteria  that  might  be  used  to  assess  one  product  or  process  against 
one  another  with  respect  to  minimizing  those  impacts”  (Watkins,  1993). 

The  panel  used  the  AHP  process,  supported  by  Expert  Choice  software,  and  group 
decisionmaking.  The  panel  developed  an  IMDI  Environmental  Impacts  Model  that  builds  on 
earlier  SET  AC  work. 

The  panel  discussed  the  possibility  of  using  Colby’s  (1991)  five  environmental 
management  paradigms  as  a  basis  for  assigning  weights  to  environmental  impacts.  The 
environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  entire  life  cycle  were  included  in  the  group’s 
proposed  model  (i.e.,  the  group  developed  an  extensive  list  of  environmental  impacts).  The 
“costs”  associated  with  these  impacts  were  not  evaluated. 

A  weighting  method  of  cost  estimation  based  on  Colby’s  five  environmental 
management  paradigms  was  discussed.  It  was  suggested  that  rather  than  deriving  or  assigning 
absolute  weights,  the  weighting  system  could  be  used  for  sensitivity  analysis  over  a  range  of 
values  for  the  different  impacts  (Watkins,  1993).  Colby’s  paper  (1991)  discussed  the 
distinctions,  connections,  and  implications  for  the  future  of  environmental  management  by 
describing  the  changing  strategies  and  the  related  philosophies  of  the  following  broad 
environmental  management  paradigms: 

•  frontier  economics, 

•  environmental  protection, 

•  resource  management, 

•  eco-development,  and 

•  deep  ecology. 

Associated  with  each  paradigm  are  differing  philosophies  of  human-nature  relationships. 
The  paradigms  are  overlapping  and  encompass  several  schools  of  thought.  Colby’s  paper  does 
not  explicitly  detail  methods  for  evaluating  environmental  costs;  however,  it  suggests  that 
environmental  costs  would  be  treated  differently  according  to  the  prevailing  environmental 
management  paradigm.  The  following  is  a  description  of  the  possible  environmental  costing 
methodologies  under  each  of  the  five  paradigms. 

Frontier  Economics 

•  Property  owners  and  the  public  at  large  pay  environmental  costs  (not  necessarily  the 
polluter). 


7-9 


•  Production  is  limited  by  manmade  factors.  Natural  factors  are  not  accounted  for. 
Analytic  modeling  and  planning  methodologies  include  net  present  value, 
maximization,  and  cost/benefit  analysis  of  tangible  goods  and  services. 

•  Economic  analysis  is  based  on  the  neoclassical  model  of  the  closed  economic  system. 

Environmental  Protection 

•  Taxpayers  (public  at  large)  pay  environmental  costs. 

•  Analytic  modeling  and  planning  methodologies  include  environmental  impact 
assessment  after  design,  optimum  pollution  levels,  equation  of  WTP  and  compensation 
principles. 

•  Economic  analysis  is  based  on  the  neoclassical  model  of  the  closed  economic  system. 
Ecological  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify,  so  environmental  management  in  this 
paradigm  is  treated  strictly  as  an  added  cost. 

Resource  Management 

•  “Polluter”  (producers  and  consumers)  pays  environmental  costs. 

•  Analytic  modeling  and  planning  methodologies  include  natural  capital;  true  (Hicksian) 
income;  maximization  of  United  Nations  System  of  National  Accounts;  ecosystem  and 
social  health  monitoring;  and  linkages  between  population,  poverty,  and  environment. 

•  Economic  analysis  based  on  an  extension  of  neoclassical  economics  that  incorporates 
all  types  of  capital  and  resources — biophysical,  human,  infrastructural,  and 
monetary — into  calculations  of  national  accounts,  productivity,  and  policies  for 
development  and  investment  planning. 

•  Pollution  can  be  considered  a  “negative  resource”  (causing  natural  capital  degradation), 
rather  than  an  externality. 

•  The  concern  for  nature  stems  from  the  fact  that  hurting  nature  is  beginning  to  hurt 
economic  man.  Environmental  expenditures  are  considered  necessary  to  avoid  “more” 
costs. 

Eco-Development 

•  A  “pollution  prevention  pays”  concept  rewards  those  that  do  not  pollute.  The  economy 
is  structured  to  reduce  pollution  as  a  throughput. 

•  Analytic  modeling  and  planning  methodologies  include  ecological  economics;  open 
system  dynamics;  socio-technical  and  ecosystem  process  design;  integration  of  social, 
economic,  and  ecological  criteria  for  technology;  and  trade  and  capital  flow  based  on 
community  goals  and  management. 

•  The  relationship  between  society  and  nature  can  be  considered  a  “positive  sum  game.” 
Human  activities  are  organized  to  be  synergistic  with  ecosystem  processes  and  services. 


7-10 


•  Emphasis  is  placed  on  efficient,  clean,  renewable  energy  sources;  environmental 
information;  community  consciousness;  and  experiential  quality  of  economic  activity. 

•  An  example  of  the  eco-development  paradigm  is  the  International  Joint  Commission 
between  U.S.  and  Canada,  which  explicitly  uses  a  stakeholder,  positive-sum  approach. 

Deep  Ecology 

•  Environmental  costs  avoided  by  foregoing  development. 

•  Analytic  modeling  and  planning  methodologies  include  grassroots  regional  planning, 
multiple  cultural  systems,  and  conservation  of  cultural  and  biological  diversity. 

Strengths 

One  strength  of  the  approach  used  by  IMDI  for  assessing  environmental  impacts  is  that  it 
provides  a  framework  and  methodology  for  breaking  complex  problems  down  into  constituent 
parts.  The  method  provides  a  framework  for  organizing  complex  issues  into  a  more  easily 
manageable  format  that  defines  goals,  objectives,  subobjectives,  and  criteria  relating  to 
environmental  quality.  The  criteria  may  then  be  assessed  individually  against  expert  knowledge 
and  stakeholder  values  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  problem  at  hand.  Through  the  use 
of  the  IMDI  methodology,  coefficients  can  be  established  for  various  substances  that  indicate  the 
relative  environmental  impact  of  those  substances.  Such  coefficients  may  be  directly  compared, 
allowing  for  a  relative  comparison  of  individual  substances  or  the  evaluation  of  the 
environmental  profile  of  an  entire  system. 

Weaknesses 

The  primary  weakness  of  the  IMDI  approach  is  that  the  process  for  developing  weights 
for  individual  substances  is  highly  subjective.  It  is  not  clear  how  weights  developed  by  different 
groups  could  be  compared  against  one  another  in  a  meaningful  way.  The  AHP  pair-wise 
comparison  process  is  largely  a  subjective  process  requiring  expert  knowledge  to  rate  the 
intensities  of  the  environmental  impacts  being  compared.  In  the  case  of  most  future  problems, 
including  potential  environmental  impacts,  there  is  no  such  expert  knowledge.  Thus  the 
weighting  factors  developed  by  different  groups  would  not  be  very  meaningful.  In  addition,  the 
possibility  exists  that  the  experts  can  have  a  bias  and/or  misjudge  the  importance  of  particular 
attribute  intensities.  Because  the  IMDI  approach  relies  on  the  values  and  judgment  of  a  select 
group  of  individuals,  the  results  from  this  approach  probably  could  not  be  replicated. 


7-11 


The  IMDI  approach  also  concentrates  solely  on  environmental  quality  and  environmental 
impacts  and  thus  is  somewhat  limited  in  its  intended  application  to  environmentally  conscious 
manufacturing  because  additional  factors  (e.g.,  cost,  functional  requirements,  performance)  also 
contribute  to  decisions  affecting  product  design  (Watkins,  1993). 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  concept  of  assigning  weights  in  the  IMDI,  particularly  for  a  range  of  values,  is 
particularly  noteworthy  to  impact  assessment  because  it  attempts  to  provide  a  common  metric 
for  valuing  environmental  impacts.  Because  of  the  subjective  nature  of  weighting  process  used 
in  the  IMDI  approach,  its  use  would  be  more  appropriate  for  internal  impact  assessment 
applications.  The  IMDI  approach  requires  further  testing  before  results  can  be  supported  in 
external  applications. 

7.4  INTEGRATED  SUBSTANCE  CHAIN  MANAGEMENT 

Developed  by  VNCI  (an  association  of  the  Dutch  Chemical  Industry),  integrated 
substance  chain  management  (also  called  the  VNCI  process)  was  designed  to  evaluate  a 
substance  throughout  its  entire  life  cycle  (Canadian  Standards  Association,  1992).  Integrated 
substance  chain  management  was  also  designed  to  encourage  the  use  of  environmentally 
preferable  substitutes  and  recycling  alternatives  and  the  identification  and  closure  of  leaks. 

To  include  all  environmental  issues,  each  link  in  the  substance  chain  is  checked  against  a 
comprehensive  list  of  environmental  themes,  including  global  warming,  ozone  depletion, 
acidification,  eutrophication,  photochemical  ozone  formation,  dispersion  of  toxic  substances, 
disposal  of  wastes,  and  disruption/depletion  of  natural  resources. 

Based  on  rough  estimates  of  product  system  inputs  and  outputs  and  their  associated 
environmental  issues,  options  for  process  improvement  can  be  proposed.  The  selection  of 
options  for  detailed  analysis  is  based  on 

•  environmental  impact, 

•  cost  effectiveness,  and 

•  relevance  to  decisionmakers  (Canadian  Standards  Association,  1992). 

The  output  of  the  detailed  analysis  is  a  two-axis  (environmental  impact/economic  impact) 
options  map.  The  options  map  is  developed  by  determining  the  environmental  and  economic 
profiles  of  the  substance  in  question  and  positioning  the  various  options  (see  Figure  7-3).

Source:  Canadian  Standards  Association,  1992 

The  environmental  profile  provides  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the  relevant 
environmental  impacts  associated  with  each  process  option.  Impacts  are  quantified  in  terms  of  a 
single  unit  of  measurement  for  each  impact  category  (e.g.,  tonnes  of  CO2  equivalent  as  an  agent 
of  global  warming)  and  shown  in  terms  of  a  fraction  of  the  total  national  emission  of  that 
environmental  impact  theme.  Exact  changes  of  inputs  and  outputs  associated  with  each  process 
option  are  calculated  and  a  checklist  is  used  to  determine  the  extent  of  changes  in  other 
input/output  factors.  The  data  are  then  converted  to  scales  for  measuring  the  impact  on  each 
environmental  theme,  and  sensitivity  analysis  examines  how  changes  in  the  underlying  database 
of  inputs,  outputs,  and  conversion  factors  affect  the  results  of  the  analysis. 

The  economic  profile  evaluates  the  economic  impact  of  the  proposed  process  options. 
When  the  environmental  and  economic  profiles  are  completed,  all  quantitative  figures  and 
qualitative  comments  in  each  profile  are  combined  to  arrive  at  a  final  conclusion  concerning  the 
total  environmental  and  economic  impacts. 


7-13 


Relative  weights  are  then  assigned  to  each  environmental  theme  to  enable  the 
aggregation  of  environmental  impacts  associated  with  each  process  option.  The  environmental 
and  economic  impacts  are  then  combined  to  represent  a  single  point  on  the  options  map.  The 
origin  of  theoptions  map  represents  the  “do  nothing”  option.  Options  that  represent  both 
environmental  and  economic  improvements  will  be  plotted  in  the  upper  right-hand  quadrant. 
Options  that  represent  both  environmental  and  economic  setbacks  will  be  plotted  in  the  lower 
left-hand  quadrant. 

Strengths 

The  main  strength  of  the  integrated  substance  chain  management  approach  is  that  it 
provides  a  framework  and  methodology  for  integrating  environmental  concerns,  economic 
concerns,  and  stakeholder  values.  The  resulting  options  map  portrays  the  environmental  and 
economic  differences  between  process  options,  allowing  for  relatively  easy  and  objective 
decisionmaking.  In  addition,  the  development  of  relative  weights  for  each  environmental  theme 
enables  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  each  process  option  to  be  aggregated  to  yield 
an  overall  environmental  profile  for  the  system. 

Weaknesses 

The  main  weakness  of  the  integrated  substance  chain  management  approach  is  that  it 
employs  a  relatively  simplistic  weighting  scheme  and  may  not  be  applicable  to  in-depth 
assessments  of  impacts.  Additionally,  it  is  not  clear  how  life-cycle  economic  costs  would  be 
developed  for  use  in  the  options  map. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  integrated  substance  chain  management  approach  would  be  most  applicable  to 
internal  impact  assessments  where  a  number  of  different  factors  (e.g.,  environmental  protection, 
economic  well  being,  public  image)  affect  the  environmental  decisionmaking  process  and  a  less 
detailed  level  of  assessment  provides  adequate  information  to  make  the  decisions  at  hand. 

7.5  ECO-RATIONAL  PATH  METHOD  (EPM) 

EPM  represents  a  procedure  that  builds  on  the  ESR  method  described  in  Chapter  4  to 
integrate  environmental  and  economic  information — two  of  the  primary  dimensions  of 
environmental  decisionmaking.  The  process  for  integrating  these  two  dimension  comprises 
three  main  steps — recording.  Judgment,  and  decision — as  shown  in  Figure  7-4.

Looking  at  the  ecological  dimension  in  Figure  7-4,  the  first  step  is  to  collect  and  record 
information  on  environmental  releases.  Releases  in  the  context  of  EPM  include  inputs,  desired 
output,  and  undesirable  outputs.  Although  labeled  “pollution-added  account”  (see  Module  I  in 
Figure  7-4)  the  information  for  this  step  may  be  generated  through  using  traditional  inventory 
analysis  procedures.  Sometimes  the  data  developed  in  the  inventory  analysis  are  sufficient  for 
evaluating  environmental  improvement  options,  but  often  inventory  data  alone  are  insufficient. 
For  example,  when  one  system  releases  more  CO2  and  another  system  releases  more  NO^,  then 
no  obvious  and  objective  judgments  are  possible.  To  weigh  one  pollutant  against  another,  a 
preference  ranking  is  needed.  This  step,  termed  judgment,  is  a  procedure  for  developing  weights 
or  “pollution  units”  (see  Module  III  in  Figure  7-4)  for  releases  according  to  their  environmental 
relevance  (based  on  ambient  concentration  standards  for  various  media).  Developing  these 
relative  weights  is  accomplished  using  the  ESR  method  as  described  in  Chapter  4. 

With  regards  to  the  economic  dimension  as  shown  in  Figure  7-4,  the  first  step  (see 
Module  II)  is  to  collect  and  record  information  on  economic  costs/revenues  including 
environmental  compliance  costs  and  earnings.  This  information  is  typically  generated  in 
traditional  accounting  practices  but  may  need  to  be  broken  out  of  an  aggregate  account  (e.g., 
overhead)  and  appropriately  allocated  to  a  specific  product  or  process.  After  all  the  necessary 
cost/revenue  information  is  recorded,  the  contribution  margin  (see  Module  IV  in  Figure  7-4)  is 
calculated  as  a  measure  of  economic  efficiency. 

The  integration  of  the  economic  and  ecological  information  is  shown  in  Module  V  in 
Figure  7-4.  In  this  module,  the  data  produced  from  Modules  III  and  IV  are  integrated  by 
calculating  the  quotient  pollution  units  per,  for  example,  created  dollar  contribution  margin  of  a 
product  or  process.  This  calculation  provides  a  measure  of  the  economic-ecological  efficiency 
of  specific  products  and  processes.  In  general,  the  most  preferable  products  or  processes  are 
those  with  low  pollution  units  and  high  contribution  margin  (i.e.,  small  PU/CM  ratio). 

Strengths 

Some  of  the  strengths  of  the  EPM  include  the  following: 

•  framework  and  methodology  are  provided  for  integrating  environmental  and  economic 
considerations; 

•  weighting  factors  using  ambient  regulatory  standards  represent  social,  political, 
regulatory,  and  scientific  opinions  and  values; 


7-16 


•  weighting  schemes  used  in  EPM  represent  the  relative  environmental  and  economic 
impacts  of  different  chemical  releases  to  different  environmental  media; 

•  EPM  is  flexible  and  can  be  used  at  a  variety  of  different  spatial  levels  (e.g.,  state, 
regional,  and  local). 

Weaknesses 

One  weakness  of  the  EPM  is  that  the  ESR  weighting  scheme’s  use  of  relations  between 
ambient  standards  is  not  a  natural  scientific  or  ecotoxicological  based  scheme,  but  instead 
represents  a  socio-cultural  judgment  from  an  ecological  perspective  (which  relies  on 
ecotoxicological  data).  However,  no  objective  and  undoubtedly  valid  opinion  on  the 
harmfulness  of  substances  exists.  ESR  develops  weights  according  to  generally  accepted  norms 
and  values,  which  are  theoretically  expressed  in  ambient  concentration  standards.  Such  ambient 
standards  may  or  may  not  reflect  actual  environmental  impacts. 

Another  weakness  of  the  EPM  is  that  the  method  for  characterizing  the  economic  impacts 
of  pollutants  is  somewhat  simplistic.  It  is  not  clear  whether  the  results  of  the  economic  impact 
assessment  component  would  be  useful  to  decisionmakers. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  information  produced  from  applying  the  EPM  can  be  used  in  impact  assessment  to 
evaluate  and  compare  the  relative  environmental  and  economic  impacts  of  inventory  items 
where  regulatory  standards  exist.  Although  using  the  ESR  approach  provides  a  consistent 
estimate  of  the  environmental  impacts,  it  does  not  necessarily  preclude  the  need  for  additional 
analyses.  EPM  requires  additional  testing  in  the  context  of  LCA  to  better  gauge  its  applicability 
to  impact  assessment.

CHAPTER  8 

KEY  POINTS  AND  FUTURE  RESEARCH  NEEDS 


The  purpose  of  life-cycle  impact  assessment  is  to  translate  the  results  of  an  inventory 
analysis  into  a  description  of  environmental  impacts,  providing  users  with  additional  information 
to  discern  between  alternatives  (e.g.,  inventory  items,  systems).  Impact  assessment  also  makes 
explicit  the  methods  used  to  compare  and  weigh  alternatives.  This  document  covers  a  wide 
variety  of  issues  related  to  impact  assessment  and  outlines  existing  methods  that  have  been  used 
or  presented  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment.  Again,  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  this 
document  is  not  a  guidance  document,  but  rather  a  compendium  on  the  state  of  practice  of 
impact  assessment. 

This  final  chapter  summarizes  some  of  the  key  points  discussed  throughout  this 
document  and  provides  a  listing  of  potential  research  needs  for  the  future  research  and 
development  of  impact  assessment  techniques  and  methods.  While  impact  assessment  is  still  in 
its  infancy,  this  document  illustrates  promise  for  the  current  applications  and  future  development 
of  impact  assessment  techniques  and  methods. 

8.1  SUMMARY  OF  KEY  POINTS 

This  document  covers  a  broad  range  of  material  which  cuts  across  a  variety  of  research 
areas.  Some  of  the  key  points  that  can  be  drawn  are  summarized  below. 

•  Impact  assessment  has  been  conceptually  defined  to  include  three  phases:  classification 
of  inventory  items  into  impact  categories,  characterization  of  potential  impacts,  and 
valuation  of  impacts.  However,  formal  procedures  and  methods  for  conducting  impact 
assessment  have  not  yet  been  established. 

•  Impact  assessment  may  be  useful  for  a  variety  of  both  internal  and  external  applications 
(see  Chapter  1).  Although  internal  applications  may  not  be  required  to  follow  stringent 
LCA  guidelines,  they  should  nonetheless  follow  the  best  practice. 

•  Practitioners  may  not  need  to  complete  a  full  impact  assessment  to  obtain  useful 
information.  In  some  cases,  merely  classifying  inventory  items  into  impact  categories 
may  provide  adequate  information  for  users  to  identify  improvement  options.  In  other 
cases,  a  more  detailed  impact  assessment  information  may  be  needed. 

•  A  wide  variety  of  methods  are  available  for  use  in  impact  assessment  (see  Chapters  4 
through  7),  ranging  from  simplistic  checklists  to  complete  risk  and  economic  impact 
assessments.  A  rule-of-thumb  for  choosing  the  appropriate  method(s)  is  to  choose  the 
method(s)  that  provides  adequately  detailed  information  to  make  the  decision  at  hand 


8-1 


(usually  to  discern  the  relative  impact  of  different  substances).  A  more  complex 
method(s)  is  used  only  when  the  resulting  information  is  needed  to  advance  the 
decision  to  be  made. 

•  There  is  a  general  lack  of  methods  for  assessing  the  impacts  of  nonchemical  loadings 
(e.g.,  habitat  alteration,  heat,  noise)  to  the  environment.  Many  of  the  existing  methods 
for  characterizing  impacts  (see  Chapter  4)  are  based  upon  chemical  exposure  and 
toxicology  data  and  cannot  readily  be  used  to  assess  the  impact  of  nonchemical 
loadings. 

•  There  are  a  number  of  places  in  the  impact  assessment  where  value  judgments  may 
play  a  significant  role.  It  is  critical  that  practitioners  document  points  in  the  impact 
assessment  process  where  value  judgments  were  employed,  the  set  of  values  used  to 
make  the  judgment,  and  how  those  judgments  may  affect  the  outcome  of  the  impact 
assessment; 

•  A  significant  level  of  uncertainty  is  associated  with  impact  assessment  (e.g.,  linking 
inventory  items  to  impacts).  Uncertainty,  however,  is  a  fact  of  life  for  virtually  all 
areas  of  research.  Although  there  are  currently  no  formal  procedures  for  evaluating 
uncertainty  in  impact  assessment,  practitioners  should  nonetheless  document  and 
evaluated  sources  of  uncertainty  and  appropriately  qualify  impact  assessment  results. 

•  As  with  other  LCA  components,  it  is  critical  that  practitioners  clearly  communicate  the 
content  and  conduct  aspects  of  the  impact  assessment  in  the  final  LCA  report.  This 
includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the  goals  and  scope,  data  sources  used  and  their  quality, 
models  used  and  their  assumptions  and  limitations;  and  data  or  methodology 
manipulations;  value  judgments  employed,  and  the  analyst’s  interpretation  of  these 
aspects  on  the  overall  LCA  results. 

8.2  POTENTIAL  FUTURE  RESEARCH  NEEDS 

Potential  research  needs  (adapted  from  Vigon  and  Evers,  1992)  identified  by  the  LCA 
community  regarding  the  future  development  and  application  of  impact  assessment  tools  and 
procedures  are  listed  in  Table  8-1.

Under  Section  102  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA),  federal  agencies 
are  required  to  make  a  full  and  adequate  analysis  of  all  environmental  effects  of  implementing 
its  programs  or  actions  (Jain  et  al.,  1993).  In  the  context  of  NEPA,  an  environmental  impact 
assessment  (EIA)  is  used  for  determining  if  a  more  detailed  environmental  impact  statement 
(EIS)  is  required.  EIAs  utilize  a  list  of  environmental  “attributes”  for  which  baseline  values  are 
compared  against  actual  or  expected  values  to  determine  the  level  of  potential  impact.  After  the 
environmental  “attributes”  are  determined,  the  EIA  scoping  process  is  used  to  evaluate  and 
streamline  a  comprehensive  list  of  “attributes”  or  impacts. 

The  comprehensive  list  of  environmental  attributes  considered  in  an  EIA  and  the  scoping 
process  used  to  streamline  that  comprehensive  list  to  a  reference  project  may  be  useful  in  the 
context  of  impact  assessment  where  a  wide  variety  of  impacts  require  consideration.  These 
components  of  EIA  are  described  in  further  detail  in  the  following  sections. 

A.l  ENVIRONMENTAL  ATTRIBUTES  ADDRESSED  IN  EIA 

Environmental  attributes  are  variables  that  represent  characteristics  of  the  environment 
(see  Table  A-1).  The  environment  is  difficult  to  characterize  because  it  contains  numerous 
attributes  exhibiting  complex  interrelationships.  However,  anticipated  changes  in  the  attributes 
of  the  environment  and  their  interrelationships  are  defined  as  potential  impacts.  All  lists  of 
environmental  attributes  are  a  shorthand  method  for  focusing  on  important  characteristics  of  the 
environment.  Because  of  the  complex  nature  of  the  environment,  any  such  listing  is  limited  and, 
consequently,  may  not  capture  every  potential  impact.  The  more  complete  the  listing  is,  the 
more  likely  it  will  reflect  all  important  effects  on  the  environment,  but  this  list  may  be  expensive 
and  cumbersome  to  apply. 

Table  A-2  summarizes  possible  environmental  attributes  in  eight  categories  that  comprise 
the  biophysical  and  socioeconomic  environment  at  a  generalized  level.  While  this  list  of 
attributes  represents  a  reasonable  breakdown  of  environmental  parameters,  it  is  likely  to  require 
modification  or  supplementation  depending  on  the  type  of  action  to  be  assessed.  For  a  more 
complete  description  of  these  attributes,  the  reader  is  referred  to  Jain  et  al.  (1993). 

A.2  EIA  SCOPING  PROCESS 

When  EIAs  were  first  introduced,  decisionmaking  based  on  EISs  was  being 
compromised  by  their  inclusion  of  what  many  considered  to  be  insignificant  factors.  These 
insignificant  factors  were  considered  to  be  background  noise,  while  significant  factors  were  in

danger  of  being  concealed  and  possibly  overlooked.  “Scoping”  was  introduced  in  EIA  as  a 
process  used  to  determine  the  range  (i.e.,  scope)  of  issues  to  be  addressed.  CEQ  regulations 
require  using  the  scoping  process  early  in  the  planning  stages,  as  soon  as  practicable  after  agency 
decision  to  prepare  an  EIS.

In  the  first  part  of  the  EIA  scoping  process,  a  comprehensive  list  of  impacts  is 
streamlined  to  a  particular  study  to  minimize  the  proliferation  of  insignificant  items  (Jain  et  al., 
1993).  Impacts  cannot  be  eliminated  from  this  comprehensive  list  without  fu’st  evaluating  the 
significance  or  relevance  of  those  impacts  to  the  proposed  project.  For  example,  it  would  be 
inappropriate  for  a  proposed  project  to  consider  impacts  to  a  timber  resources  category  if  the 
project  does  not  utilize,  or  produce  an  adverse  impact  on,  timber  resources.  Thus,  not  only  does 
this  scoping  process  reduce  inefficient  use  of  time  and  resources,  but  it  also  helps  to  pinpoint  the 
most  critical  impacts  for  analysts  and  decisionmakers  to  consider. 

The  second  part  of  the  EIA  scoping  process  entails  the  tiering  of  impacts.  Tiering  comes 
into  play  when  some  of  the  impact  categories  on  the  “long  list”  are  potentially  affected  by  a 
project,  but  they  are  of  fairly  insignificant  consequence.  Such  impacts  are  tiered  to  a  lower  level 
of  importance  and  not  initially  evaluated  in  the  study  (although  they  may  be  evaluated  during  the 
study  if  necessary).  The  EIAs  used  tiering  to  organize  the  comprehensive  list  of  impacts  in  a 
more  manageable  and  meaningful  manner,  by  differentiating  relatively  insignificant  and 
significant  impacts.  The  same  problem  may  exist  in  impact  assessment  where  a  practitioner  may 
need  to  evaluate  potentially  large  numbers  of  impacts  in  the  classification  phase  and  streamline 
the  list  in  the  characterization  phase. 

From  these  two  activities,  a  comprehensive  list  of  environmental  impacts  may  be  tailored 
to  a  specific  reference  project  to  help  analysts  and  decisionmakers  pinpoint  and  address  the 
critical  impacts  associated  with  the  project. 

In  summary,  the  EIA  scoping  process  requires  an  early  analysis  of  potential  impacts  with 
reference  to  a  specific  project.  The  scoping  process  strives  to 

1)  eliminate  inappropriate  impact  categories  from  the  analysis, 

2)  tier  less  important  impact  categories  to  a  lower  level  of  analysis,  and 

3)  identify  the  critical  impacts  that  must  be  addressed  in  the  analysis.

Appendix  B 
Additional  Impact 
Assessment  Methods 


This  appendix  contains  descriptions  of  methods  that  have  been  evaluated  for  applicability 
to  impact  assessment  but  have  not  been  tested  or  presented  in  the  context  of  LCA.  As  in  the 
presentation  of  methods  in  Chapters  4  through  7,  the  methods  in  this  Appendix  are  presented  in 
the  order  of  increasing  level  of  detail. 

B.l  GREEN  INDICATORS 

Green  indicators  are  calculated  characteristics  of  a  product  or  process  that  may  be  used  to 
evaluate  the  environmental  compatibility  of  the  product  or  process  by  identifying  indicators  that 
are  undesirably  high  or  low.  The  ultimate  goal  of  the  green  indicators  is  to  give  environmental 
concerns  equal  weight  with  other  more  traditional  concerns,  such  as  manufacturing  and 
reliability,  as  part  of  an  overall  approach  to  green  engineering  design  (Navinchandra,  1991). 
Table  B-1  lists  some  green  indicators  that  may  be  useful  for  a  simple  impact  assessment  (i.e., 
loading-type  assessment). 

Strengths 

The  primary  strength  of  using  the  green  indicators  is  that  they  provide  a  multi¬ 
dimensional  view  of  a  product  system  that  can  enable  decisionmakers  to  simultaneously  address 
a  wide  variety  of  issues  and  concerns.  For  example,  most  environmental  assessment  techniques 
only  provide  information  on  environmental  effects.  Green  indicators  provide  information  not 
only  on  environmental  effects,  but  also  on  product  performance,  recyclability,  useful  life,  cost, 
etc.  Such  information  is  integral  to  making  high  quality  decisions  concerning  tradeoffs  between 
alternatives  products,  processes,  and  materials  as  well  as  between  environmental,  economic,  and 
production  concerns. 

Some  additional  strengths  of  the  green  indicators  include  the  following: 

•  relatively  convenient  and  easy  to  calculate, 

•  limited  amount  of  external  data  is  required, 

•  can  be  used  as  part  of  an  overall  green  product  design  program,  and 

•  involves  a  life-cycle  perspective. 

Weaknesses 

One  possible  weakness  of  the  green  indicators  is  that  they  do  not  estimate  environmental 
impacts  per  se.  Rather,  the  indicators  are  merely  proxies  that  can  be  related  to  environmental 
impacts.  For  example,  although  the  degradability  indicator  provides  an  estimate  of  the  portion 
of  material  in  a  product  that  is  degradable,  it  does  not  indicate  how  harmful  the  degradable  and 


B-1 


TABLE  B-1.  EXAMPLE  GREEN  INDICATORS 


Indicator 

Description 

Percent  Recycled 

The  percentage  of  recycled  material  in  a  product. 

Degradability 

The  ratio  of  the  volume  of  degradable  material  in  a  product  to  the  total 
volume  of  the  product. 

Life 

The  time  it  takes  for  the  degradable  portion  of  a  product  to  degrade.  A 
curve  showing  the  expected  volume  of  reduction  over  time  is  used  to 
determine  life. 

Junk  Value 

This  is  a  measure  of  the  total  time  a  product  will  take  to  degrade  into 
the  environment.  It  is  calculated  as  the  area  under  the  life  curve  (above) 
and  expressed  in  units  of  cubic  inches  per  year. 

Separability 

A  measure  of  what  materials  can  be  separated  from  a  product.  It  is  the 
ratio  of  the  volume  of  separable  materials  to  the  total  volume  of  the 
product.  (The  notion  of  separability  is  different  from  disassembly.) 

Potential  Recyclability 

The  ratio  of  the  volume  of  recyclable  materials  to  that  of  unrecyclable 
materials. 

Possible  Recyclability 

Composites  and  glued  materials  are  potentially  recyclable  but  cannot  be 
recycled  because  they  are  inseparable.  This  indicator  must  be  measured 
on  a  part-by-part  basis  and  must  take  into  account  the  available 
recycling  methods  and  their  economic  viabilities. 

Useful  Life 

When  a  material  leaves  the  environment  and  enters  the  human  world  it 
is  being  used.  Useful  life  is  defined  as  the  time  an  item  spends  in  the 
activity  for  which  it  was  designed. 

Utilization 

The  ratio  of  the  useful  life  of  a  product  or  material  to  the  time  it  takes  to 
“return”  to  the  environment. 

Net  Emissions 

The  respective  sums  of  solid,  gaseous,  and  waterborne  emissions  from  a 
particular  product  or  process  life  cycle. 

Total  Emissions 

The  sum  of  all  solid,  gaseous,  and  waterborne  emissions  taken  together 
from  a  particular  product  or  process  life  cycle. 

Total  Hazardous  Fugitives 

A  measure  of  the  weight  of  hazardous  fugitives,  expressed  as  the  ratio 
of  the  weight  of  hazardous  emissions  per  unit  weight  of  product. 

Source:  Navinchandra,  1991. 

nondegradable  portions  may  be  to  the  environment.  The  approach  merely  assumes  that  less 
nondegradable  material  is  necessarily  “better”  for  the  environment. 

B-2 


Some  additional  weaknesses  of  the  green  indicators  include  the  following: 

•  too  simplistic, 

•  does  not  account  for  impacts  to  human  health,  and 

•  unclear  how  some  indicators  (e.g.,  life-cycle  cost)  would  be  calculated. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  green  indicators  approach  would  likely  be  most  suitable  for  a  less  detailed  Tier  1- 
type  assessment  of  environmental  impacts.  Although  somewhat  simplistic,  the  green  indicators 
would  enable  decisionmakers  to  consider  a  wide  variety  of  factors  in  addition  to  emission  levels 
that  can  be  integral  to  making  decisions  concerning  tradeoffs  between  alternative  products, 
processes,  and  materials  as  well  as  between  environmental,  economic,  and  production  concerns. 

B.2  POLAROID’S  ENVIRONMENTAL  ACCOUNTING  AND  REPORTING  SYSTEM 
(EARS) 

Polaroid’s  Environmental  Accounting  and  Reporting  System  (EARS)  was  developed  as  a 
tool  to  help  measure  the  progress  of  its  Toxic  Use  and  Waste  Reduction  (TUWR)  Program  goals. 
EARS  is  a  centralized  database  that  allows  Polaroid  to  track  virtually  every  one  of  the  1,400 
materials  the  company  uses,  from  office  paper  to  chlorinated  solvents  (Nash  et  al.,  1992).  Each 
material  is  classified  into  one  of  five  toxicity  categories  to  reflect  the  degree  of  potential 
environmental  harm  it  poses  (see  Table  B-2).  With  EARS,  Polaroid  records  the  quantities  and 
treatment  methods  of  materials  in  all  five  categories  at  several  points  along  the  process  line. 

Use,  waste,  and  by-products  are  measured  and  recorded  per  unit  of  production. 

Strengths 

EARS  has  turned  out  to  be  a  beneficial  program  because  it 

•  provides  employees  with  information  needed  to  assess  the  environmental  quality  of 
their  actions; 

•  provides  incentives  for  making  continual  improvements  in  environmental  performance; 

•  provides  an  effective  Total  Quality  Environmental  Management  (TQEM)  tool, 
fulfilling  several  different  functions  throughout  the  company; 

•  allows  employees  to  predict  the  environmental  impacts  of  new  chemicals  before  the 
company  makes  a  commitment  to  their  use;  and 

•  translates  complex  environmental  data  into  a  simple  index  that  has  meaning  throughout 
the  company  (Nash  et  al.,  1992).

Weaknesses 

The  primary  weakness  of  EARS  is  that  it  does  not  measure  environmental  releases  nor 
does  it  estimate  environmental  impacts.  EARS  is  essentially  a  classification  system  in  which 
chemicals  may  be  grouped  according  to  their  known  environmental  toxicity. 

In  addition,  many  complain  that  EARS  data  requirements  are  too  time  consuming  and 
that  EARS  is  cumbersome  to  use  (see  Nash  et  al.,  1992).  Accuracy  is  also  a  persistent  concern. 
People  responsible  for  computing  EARS  numbers  and  recording  the  data  have  varying  levels  of 
skill  and  familiarity  with  the  materials  of  interest.  In  addition,  EARS  is  not  linked  with  the 
company’s  financial  system.  Thus,  the  company  is  unable  to  readily  assess  the  financial  benefits 
of  environmental  improvements  to  its  operation. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

It  is  unclear  how  EARS  could  be  used  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment.  Perhaps  at  a 
most  basic  level,  inventory  items  could  be  grouped  into  EARS-like  categories  based  on  their 
relative  environmental  toxicity.  This  would  result  in  a  listing  of  the  most  critical  inventory  items 


B-4 


and  their  respective  quantities  that  possibly  could  help  analysts  and  decisionmakers  pinpoint 
improvement  opportunities  and/or  areas  that  require  a  more  detailed  level  of  analysis.  Such  an 
approach  would  likely  be  more  appropriate  for  internal  rather  than  external  applications. 

B.3  JUDGMENT  PROBABILITY  ENCODING 

Judgment  probability  encoding  was  developed  by  Argonne  National  Laboratory  to 
provide  a  means  of  quantifying  subjective  probabilities  for  impacts.  The  main  objective  of  this 
approach  is  to  reduce  divergence  among  expert  judgment  through  an  encoding  process  in 
estimating  the  probability  of  impact(s)  resulting  from  exposure  to  substances. 

Encoding  in  this  context  ensures  that  the  questions  used  to  derive  judgment  probabilities 
are  always  phrased  identically,  that  specific  assumptions  and  definitions  are  always  the  same, 
and  that  the  encoding  process  proceeds  similarly  for  each  of  the  participants  (Argonne  National 
Laboratory,  1991).  Thus,  any  differences  in  judgment  probabilities  can  be  attributed  to  true 
differences  in  values  or  opinions  and  not  to  differences  in  assumptions,  understanding,  or 
procedures. 

The  output  of  the  judgment  probability  encoding  approach  is  a  range  of  probabilities 
regarding  a  specific  function,  (i.e.,  the  likelihood  of  impact  X  resulting  from  pollutant  A).  The 
encoded  judgment  probability  may  then  be  communicated  in  a  variety  of  ways — as  a 
distribution,  a  range,  a  mean,  or  a  median.  For  example,  consider  the  scenario  where  five 
experts  were  solicited  for  judgment  probabilities  regarding  the  likelihood  of  X  tons  of  CFCs 
being  linked  with  stratospheric  ozone  depletion.  Each  expert  is  provided  exactly  the  same 
information,  assumptions,  understanding,  and  procedures  in  exactly  the  same  manner.  For  the 
purposes  of  this  example,  generic  probabilities  are  provided  in  Table  B-3.  These  judgment 
probabilities  are  then  used  to  derive  further  quantitative  characterizations  of  value  judgments. 
For  instance,  the  analyst  may  decide  to  use  a  mean  (0.25)  to  express  the  probability  judgment 
values  or  a  range  (0.15  to  0.35). 

Strengths 

The  primary  advantage  of  the  judgment  probability  encoding  approach  is  that  it  can  take 
into  account  the  normalization  (via  impact  probability  values)  of  a  wide  variety  of  potential 
impacts.  By  normalizing  impacts,  this  approach  enables  decisionmakers  to  choose  alternatives 
from  a  subjective  point  of  view — by  relying  only  on  the  probability  figures  as  impact 
descriptors.  In  addition,  the  judgment  probability  encoding  approach  is  easy  to  conduct.

Mean  =0.18-0.25 

Range  =0.10-0.35 

Weaknesses 

The  disadvantages  of  the  judgment  probability  encoding  approach  are  that  it  measures 
impacts  indirectly,  in  terms  of  judgment  probabilities,  and  it  may  be  too  simplistic  for  impact 
assessment.  It  would  also,  for  all  practical  terms,  be  impossible  to  replicate  the  results  of  a 
judgment  probability  encoding  study.  However,  results  from  similar  studies  could  be  used  to 
verify  and  support  the  results  of  a  judgment  probability  encoding  study. 

A  code  of  good  practice  will  need  to  be  established  for  selecting  and  conducting  the 
expert  encoding  process  to  elicit  judgment  probabilities.  Some  questions  that  may  need  to  be 
considered  in  this  respect  include  the  following: 

•  Who  chooses  the  expert  panel? 

•  How  many  experts  are  required  to  conduct  the  approach? 

•  From  which  fields  should  the  experts  be  chosen? 

•  Who  approves  the  selection  of  experts  and  monitors  the  judgment  probability  encoding 
process? 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  judgment  probability  encoding  process  may  be  useful  in  the  context  of  impact 
assessment  as  a  simplified  impact  characterization  approach  based  upon  expert  judgment.  Being 
an  entirely  subjective  approach,  it  would  be  more  appropriate  for  internal  that  external 


B-6 


applications.  In  addition,  the  judgment  probability  encoding  approach  may  be  useful  in  cases 
where  data  on  environmental  conditions  are  not  available  or  where  nontraditional  impact 
categories  are  involved  (e.g.,  species  loss,  habitat  destruction,  aesthetic  loss). 

B.4  HUMAN  EXPOSURE  DOSE/RODENT  POTENCY  DOSE  INDEX 

The  Human  Exposure  Dose/Rodent  Potency  Dose  (HERP)  Index  provides  a  common 
factor  for  measuring  the  potency  of  various  carcinogenic  substances.  The  HERP  Index  is 
calculated  by  determining  the  ratio  of  TD^q  to  human  exposure.  TD5Q  is  the  daily  dose  rate  (in 
milligrams  per  kilogram)  needed  to  halve  the  percentage  of  tumor-free  animals  at  the  end  of  a 
standard  lifetime  (Ames  et  al.,  1987).  Analogous  to  LD5Q  the  lower  the  dose  rate,  or  TD^q 
value,  the  more  potent  the  carcinogen.  Some  example  HERP  Index  values  for  specific 
carcinogens  are  shown  in  Table  B-4.  Because  the  rodent  data  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of 
lifetime  exposure  at  the  indicated  daily  dose  rate,  the  human  exposure  data  are  also  expressed  as 
lifetime  daily  dose  rates  despite  the  notion  that  human  exposure  may  likely  be  less  than  daily 
over  a  lifetime.

Strengths 


Using  the  HERP  Index  to  assess  carcinogenic  impacts  provides  a  means  of  normalizing 
carcinogenic  substances  and  allows  for  different  types  of  carcinogens  to  be  directly  compared  for 
their  carcinogenic  potential.  In  addition,  the  HERP  Index  allows  for  different  types  of 
carcinogens  to  be  aggregated  so  that  the  total  contribution  of  inventory  items  to  cancer  can  be 
assessed.  In  addition,  a  TD5Q  database  already  exists  but  is  quite  extensive. 

Weaknesses 

On  the  downside,  using  the  HERP  Index  values  as  direct  estimates  of  impact  would  be 
inappropriate.  Many  uncertainties  and  assumptions  are  associated  with  extrapolating  from 
experimentation  on  rodents  to  values  for  human  carcinogenicity.  Another  problem  with  using 
the  HERP  Index  is  that  information  is  lacking  on  natural  carcinogens  and  their  relationship  to 
man-made  carcinogenic  substances. 

In  addition,  the  HERP  Index  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  dose-response  relationships 
are  linear,  but  this  assumption  may  not  be  correct.  Dose  responses  that  are  not  linear  but 
quadratic  or  hyperbolic  would  yield  HERP  Index  values  much  lower  than  those  obtained  by 
using  a  linear  dose  response  mechanism. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  HERP  Index  may  be  useful  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment  for  characterizing, 
comparing,  and/or  aggregating  the  carcinogenic  impact  of  inventory  items.  It  should  be  stressed 
that  this  method  is  only  applicable  for  assessing  carcinogenic  impacts.  However,  because  the 
HERP  index  is  highly  controversial  within  its  own  field  of  human  health  research,  it  should  not 
be  used  in  impact  assessment. 

B.5  ENVIRONMENTAL  INDICES 

A  wide  variety  of  environmental  indices  have  been  developed  to  provide  an  estimate 
ambient  pollutant  levels  in  different  environmental  media.  These  ambient  levels  of  pollutants 
are  used  as  a  proxy  for  estimating  environmental  impacts.  These  indices  are,  in  essence, 
equivalency  functions  that  may  be  used  to  compare  the  relative  impact  of  a  variety  of  different 
substances  released  into  the  environment.  This  section  discusses  two  main  groups  of 
indices — air  pollution  indices  and  water  pollution  indices. 


B-8 


Strengths 

A  main  strength  of  the  environmental  indices  described  in  this  section  is  that  they  have 
been  developed,  refined,  and  used  in  practice  for  a  number  of  years.  There  is  a  large  body  of 
experience  to  draw  upon  for  using  and  interpreting  such  indices. 

Weaknesses 

A  primary  weakness  of  the  indices  included  in  this  section  is  that  they  account  for  only  a 
small  subset  of  possible  pollutants.  In  addition,  the  indices  provide  measures  of  ambient 
concentrations  for  a  region  as  a  whole.  Thus  using  the  indices  to  estimate  the  contribution  of  a 
single  source  of  pollution  to  overall  regional  levels  would  be  difficult. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

Although  the  indices  described  in  this  section  do  not  measure  impacts  per  se,  they  may 
be  used  to  compare  “before”  and  “after”  scenarios  for  the  releases  of  a  proposed  project  or  used 
as  baseline  information  for  conducting  a  detail  impact  assessment.  Beyond  providing  an 
indication  of  ambient  pollutant  concentrations  in  regional  air  and  water  sinks,  the  use  of 
environmental  indices  in  the  context  of  impact  assessment  is  unclear. 

B.4.1  Air  Pollution  Indices 

A  number  of  air  pollution  indices  have  been  proposed  in  journals,  conference 
proceedings,  and  research  reports.  Additional  indices  have  been  developed  by  state  and  local  air 
pollution  control  agencies  and  have  been  implemented  to  routinely  report  air  quality  data  to  the 
public.  In  the  mid-1970’s,  so  many  different  reporting  schemes  were  in  use  that  the  government 
found  it  necessary  to  adopt  a  national  air  pollution  index,  the  Pollutant  Standards  Index  (PSI) 
(Ott,  1987).  The  PSI  and  other  air  pollution  indices  are  summarized  in  Table  B-5. 

B.4.2  Water  Pollution  Indices 

Indices  have  also  been  developed  that  can  be  used  with  data  available  from  current  water 
quality  monitoring  activities  to  provide  an  estimate  of  water  pollution  (see  Table  B-6).  There 
are  two  basic  types  of  water  pollution  indices:  increasing  scale  indices  and  decreasing  scale 
indices.  Increasing  scale  indices  refer  to  “water  pollution”  indices  while  decreasing  scale  indices 
refer  to  “water  quality”  indices  (Ott,  1987).  Water  pollution  indices  may  also  be  grouped  into 
five  main  categories:

I 


•  general  water  quality  indices, 

•  specific-use  indices, 

•  planning  indices, 

•  statistical  approaches,  and 

•  biological  indices  (Ott,  1987). 

Table  B-6  summarizes  these  indices  (with  the  exception  of  biological  indices  not 
amenable  to  classification).  Three  general  types  of  biological  water  quality  indices  evaluate 
water  quality  on  the  basis  of  its  impact  on  aquatic  life — types  and  quantities  of  certain  indicator 
organisms,  mathematical  properties  of  populations  of  organisms,  and  physiological  or  behavioral 
responses  of  certain  organisms  to  pollution. 

B.6  DEGREE  OF  HAZARD  EVALUATION 

The  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  system  was  developed  as  a  scientifically  sound  and 
consistent  way  to  deregulate  the  tracking  of  non-RCRA  special  wastes  that  pose  low  or 
negligible  hazard.  The  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  ranks  wastes  according  to  their  respective 
degrees  of  hazard  and  is  based  on  five  characteristics  of  a  waste  stream: 

•  weighted  accumulative  toxicity  of  constituents  (as  modified  by  environmental  fate), 

•  disease  potential  (infectious  waste), 

•  fire  (ignitability), 

•  leaching  agents  (pH),  and 

•  biological  hazard  (biodegradability)  (Plewa  et  al.,  1986). 

The  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  places  primary  emphasis  on  toxicity  to  rank  potential 
hazard.  Thus  toxicology  data  are  used  to  generate  a  numerical  score  for  a  substance’s  equivalent 
toxicity  (Plewa  et  al.,  1986).  The  calculation  of  equivalent  toxic  concentration  of  each  life-cycle 
waste  component  (C^^)  is  as  follows: 

Equivalent  Toxic  Concentration  =  =  A^  (Cj/BjTj) 

where 

Cj  =  the  concentration  of  component  i  as  a  percentage  of  the  waste  by  weight, 

Tj  =  a  measure  of  the  toxicity  of  component  i. 


B-13 


A  =  a  constant  equal  to  300  used  to  allow  entry  of  percent  values  for  Cj  and  to  adjust 
the  results  so  that  a  reference  material,  100  percent  copper  sulfate  with  an  oral 
toxicity  of  300  mg/kg,  achieves  an  equivalent  toxicity  of  100,  and 

=  a  conversion  factor  used  to  convert  toxicides  (tj)  to  equivalent  oral  toxicides. 
Table  B-7  shows  conversion  factors  (Bj)  for  various  toxicity  measures. 

For  carcinogens  and  mutagens,  a  TD5Q  oral  rat  dose  is  used  if  available.  Otherwise 
carcinogens  are  assigned  a  0.1  mg/kg,  and  mutagens  are  assigned  a  Tj  of  0.6  mg/kg. 

Toxicides  are  converted  to  equivalent  oral  toxicides  as  specified  in  Table  B-7.  Oral  rat  toxicity 
values  are  preferred,  followed  by  inhalation  rat,  dermal  rabbit,  aquatic  toxicity,  and  other 
mammalian  toxicity  values.  If  there  is  more  than  one  value  for  the  toxicity  from  the  best 
available  source,  the  lowest  (most  toxic  equivalent  oral  toxicity  value)  is  used.  If  a  carcinogen 
or  mutagen  is  assigned  a  value  for  T-  in  the  absence  of  a  TD^q,  B^  is  assigned  a  value  of  1. 

The  relative  toxic  amount,  M,  of  the  entire  waste  stream  mixture  is  calculated  as  follows: 

Relative  Toxic  Amount  =  M  =  S  CgQ 

where  S  =  the  maximum  size  (kg)  of  waste  output  produced  in  a  month.  The  result  of  these 
calculations  will  be  an  estimate  of  the  relative  toxic  amount  (M)  for  each  waste  output  evaluated 
that  takes  into  account  the  comparative  toxicity  and  amount  of  each  component.  For  each  waste 
output,  the  number  calculated  for  M  can  range  from  0  to  greater  than  10,000.  The  relative  toxic 
amount  is  then  converted  into  categories  of  hazard:  negligible,  low,  moderate,  or  high.

The  results  of  an  actual  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  conducted  to  evaluate  two  types  of 
sand  wastes  produced  by  an  iron  foundry  are  illustrated  in  Tables  B-8  and  B-9.  For  a  more 
complete  description  of  the  degree  of  hazard  evaluation,  refer  to  Reddy  (1985),  Plewa  et  al. 
(1986),  and  Plewa  et  al.  (1988). 

Strengths 

The  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  method  may  be  used  to  normalize  chemical  substances 
in  a  manner  that  allows  the  analyst  to  compare  not  only  the  equivalent  toxicity  of  various 
chemicals  but  also  other  inherent  characteristics  of  those  hemicals.  In  addition,  the  degree  of 
hazard  evaluation  method  has  been  used  in  practice  and  refined  for  a  number  of  years. 

Weaknesses 

One  problem  with  using  the  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  in  impact  assessment  is  data 
availability.  Out  of  over  5,000  RCRA  and  non-RCRA  waste  streams  analyzed,  over  70  percent 
were  ranked  as  “unknown”  hazards  due  primarily  to  the  following  data  deficiencies: 

•  information  that  was  required  on  waste  streams  but  was  missing,

public  literature,  and 

•  vague  names  for  wastes  or  chemicals  that  were  often  used  rather  than  trade  names. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  method  may  be  used  to  normalize  a  variety  of  chemical- 
based  inventory  items  in  a  manner  that  allows  the  analyst  to  compare  not  only  the  equivalent

toxicity  of  various  inventory  items  but  also  other  inherent  characteristics  of  those  items  as  well. 
In  addition,  degree  of  hazard  evaluation  projects  have  been  used  in  practice  for  a  number  of 
years  and  thus  may  be  currently  applicable  to  impact  assessment. 

B.7  HAZARD  RANKING  METHODS 

A  number  of  hazard  ranking  methods  have  been  developed  for  a  variety  of  different 
purposes.  Hazard  ranking  methods,  much  like  Tier  2-  and  Tier  3-type  characterization  models, 
rank  the  relative  risk  of  substances  released  to  the  environment  based  on  hazard  (e.g.,  toxicity) 
and  sometimes  exposure  (e.g.,  persistence,  bioaccumulation)  information.  The  following 
sections  describe  some  of  the  primary  hazard  ranking  methods. 

Strengths 

Hazard  ranking  methods  have  several  identifiable  advantages.  Most  are  relatively  easy  to 
use,  they  do  not  require  extensive  data,  and  three  major  routes  (groundwater,  surface  water,  and 
air)  are  considered.  In  addition,  factors  have  been  carefully  selected  for  consistency  and  to  avoid 
redundancy,  and  they  often  are  built  upon  previously  developed  models  (including  the  JRB 
Associates,  Inc.  model). 

Weaknesses 

A  number  a  criticisms  have  been  raised  about  using  hazard  ranking  methods: 

•  The  score  for  hazard  potential  is  based  on  only  the  most  hazardous  substance  rather 
than  on  a  composite  of  all  constituents. 

•  Low  population  areas  tend  to  receive  lower  scores  than  higher  population  areas. 

•  The  use  of  distance  to  population  as  a  weighting  factor  is  used  even  in  situations  where 
there  is  no  evidence  of  release. 

•  Few  provisions  exist  for  incorporating  additional  technical  information  into  the  models. 

•  Individual  factor  scores  are  often  aggregated  into  a  composite  total  score. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

The  hazard  ranking  methods  described  in  this  section  are  most  similar  to  the  Tier  2-  and 
Tier  3-type  characterization  models  described  in  Chapters  3  and  4  (see  the  toxicity,  persistence, 
and  bioaccumulation  assessment).  Most  of  these  methods  have  scoring  systems  in  which  the 
relative  “hazard”  associated  with  a  variety  of  substances  is  estimated.  Because  most  of  the 
hazard  ranking  methods  focus  on  impacts  to  human  health,  it  is  not  clear  whether  they  would  be 
useful  for  estimating  impacts  to  ecosystems  or  natural  resources.

B.7.1  EPA’s  Hazard  Ranking  System  (HRS) 


The  HRS  was  developed  by  the  MITRE  Corporation  to  meet  Comprehensive 
Environmental  Response,  Compensation,  and  Liability  Act  (CERCLA)  requirements  mandating 
that  ranking  systems  be  based  on  relative  risks.  In  this  context,  relative  risk  takes  into  account 
.  the  population  at  risk,  the  hazardous  potential  of  releases,  the  potential  for  contamination  of 
drinking  water  supplies  (for  both  ecosystem  and  human  health  impacts),  and  other  appropriate 
factors.  HRS  ranks  facilities  in  terms  of  the  potential  threat  they  pose  by  describing  the  manner 
in  which  hazardous  wastes  are  contained,  the  route  by  which  they  are  released,  the  characteristics 
and  amount  of  the  hazardous  substance,  and  the  likely  ecosystem  and  human  health  targets  (see 
Table  B-10).

The  HRS  assigns  three  scores  to  a  hazardous  facility: 

1.  The  potential  for  harm  to  humans  or  the  environment  from  migration  of  a 
hazardous  substance  away  from  the  facility  by  routes  involving  groundwater, 
surface  water,  or  air. 

2.  The  potential  for  harm  from  substances  that  can  explode  or  cause  fires. 

3.  The  potential  for  harm  from  direct  contact  with  hazardous  substances  at  the 
facility  (Sandia  National  Laboratories,  1986). 

Scores  for  each  hazard  mode  are  determined  by  evaluating  a  set  of  factors  that 
characterize  the  potential  of  the  particular  facility  to  cause  ecosystem  and  human  health  impacts. 
Each  factor  is  assigned  a  numerical  value  on  a  scale  of  0  to  3,  5,  or  8,  according  to  prescribed 
guidelines.  The  assigned  value  is  then  multiplied  by  a  weighting  factor  to  yield  the  individual 
factor  score.  The  individual  scores  may  then  be  aggregated  within  each  factor  category,  and 
then  the  aggregated  scores  for  each  factor  category  are  multiplied  together  to  develop  scores  for 
migration  (groundwater,  surface  water,  air),  fire  and  explosion,  and  direct  contact. 

Use  of  the  HRS  requires  information  about  the  facility  in  question,  its  surroundings,  the 
hazardous  substances  present,  and  the  geological  characteristics  of  the  surrounding  area.  When 
there  are  no  data  for  a  factor,  it  is  assigned  a  value  of  zero.  However,  if  a  factor  with  no  data  is 
the  only  factor  in  a  category,  then  the  factor  is  given  a  score  of  1. 

B.7.2  Modified  Hazard  Ranking  System  (MHRS) 

The  Modified  Hazard  Ranking  System  (MHRS)  was  developed  by  Battelle  Pacific 
Northwest  Laboratory  (PNL)  for  DOE  to  rank  sites  that  contain  both  chemically  hazardous  and 
radioactive  wastes.  MHRS  was  developed  to  work  within  the  framework  of  EPA’s  HRS,  and 
the  overall  scoring  system  is  the  same  for  both  methods.  The  modifications  to  the  HRS  for  sites 
containing  radioactive  wastes  were  restricted  to  the  waste  characteristics  category  of  the  ground- 
water,  surface-water,  air,  fire  and  explosion,  and  direct-contact  routes. 

In  developing  a  scoring  system  for  radioactive  wastes  in  MHRS,  the  concentration  and 
the  type  of  radiation  emitted  by  the  radionuclides  were  factored  into  the  ranking.  The  scoring  of 
the  radionuclides  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  the  potential  radiation  dose  to  a  maximally  exposed 
individual  (the  product  of  dose  factor  times  concentration  is  estimated). 

The  MHRS  splits  the  waste  characteristics  categories  into  chemical  wastes  and 
radioactive  wastes.  The  scoring  system  for  chemical  wastes  is  the  same  as  that  of  EPA’s  HRS. 
The  hazards  of  the  radioactive  and  nonradioactive  wastes  are  evaluated  separately  and  the  score 


B-19 


is  assigned  over  the  same  range  of  values.  The  higher  score  of  the  two  is  the  value  assigned  to 
the  site.  The  site  ranking  is  based  on  the  maximum  score  (chemical  or  radioactive)  from  each 
route  and  is  calculated  as  described  in  HRS.  Scoring  for  radioactive  wastes  through  each  route 
is  described  below. 

For  the  air  route,  information  on  the  maximum  observed  concentration  of  radionuclides 
in  air  at  the  site  is  required.  If  no  concentration  of  atmospheric  radioactivity  significantly  above 
background  has  been  observed,  then  the  waste  characteristics  score  for  the  air  route  is  zero.  If 
release  of  radionuclides  has  been  observed,  then  the  total  concentration  for  each  radionuclide 
group  is  calculated.  A  matrix  table  for  the  air  route  is  then  used  to  determine  the  waste 
characteristics  score  by  selecting  the  largest  value  among  the  groups. 

For  the  surface-water  route,  if  release  has  been  observed,  the  total  surface-water 
concentration  for  each  nuclide  group  is  determined  and  the  highest  resulting  waste  characteristics 
score  among  the  groups  is  selected.  The  largest  score  among  nuclide  groups  derived  from  the 
maximum  potential  surface-water  releases  is  then  compared  with  that  from  observed  release. 

The  greater  of  the  two  is  recorded  in  the  surface-water  route. 

In  the  groundwater  route,  if  release  has  been  observed,  the  highest  waste  characteristics 
score  among  the  nuclide  groups  resulting  from  the  observed  releases  is  used.  This  score  is  then 
compared  with  the  score  calculated  from  the  maximum  potential  release.  The  maximum 
potential  concentration  for  each  radionuclide  is  determined  by  multiplying  the  amount  disposed 
of  at  the  site  by  the  transport  coefficient.  The  total  potential  groundwater  concentration 
associated  with  each  nuclide  group  is  calculated  by  summing  all  radionuclides  within  the  group 
(see  Table  B-1 1).  The  waste  characteristics  score  for  each  nuclide  group  can  then  be  determined 
from  a  matrix  table  (see  Table  B-12).  The  largest  value  among  the  groups  is  compared  with  that 
from  the  observed  release.  The  greater  of  the  two  values  is  recorded  for  the  groundwater  route. 

The  fire  and  explosion  route  and  the  direct-contact  route  are  usually  of  less  importance 
than  other  routes  for  hazardous  waste  sites.  Therefore,  a  detailed  description  for  scoring  these 
two  routes  is  not  provided  here. 

B.7.3  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  Hazard  Assessment  Rating  Methodology 

The  USAF  has  sought  to  establish  a  system  to  “develop  and  maintain  a  priority  listing  of 
contaminated  installations  and  facilities  for  remedial  action  based  on  potential  hazard  to  public 
health,  welfare,  and  environmental  impacts”  (Sandia  National  Laboratories,  1986).  As  part  of 
this  system  priorities  are  to  be  set  for  taking  further  actions  at  sites.  Thus  the  Hazard

Assessment  Rating  Methodology  was  developed  to  provide  a  relative  ranking  of  sites  that  are 
suspected  of  having  been  contaminated  from  hazardous  substances. 

The  Hazard  Assessment  Rating  Methodology  considers  four  aspects  of  the  hazard  posed 
at  a  specific  site: 


B-21 


•  the  possible  receptors  of  the  contamination, 

•  the  waste  and  its  characteristics, 

•  potential  pathways  for  waste  contaminant  migration,  and 

•  any  efforts  to  contain  the  contaminants. 

Each  of  these  categories  contains  a  number  of  rating  factors  that  are  used  in  the  overall 
hazard  rating.  For  example,  the  waste  characteristics  category  is  scored  in  three  steps.  First,  a 
point  rating  is  assigned  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  waste  quantity  and  the  hazard  (worst  case) 
associated  with  the  site.  Second,  the  score  is  multiplied  by  a  waste  persistence  factor,  which 
reduces  the  score  if  the  waste  is  not  very  persistent.  Finally,  the  score  is  modified  according  to 
the  physical  state  of  the  waste.  Scores  for  liquid  wastes  are  unchanged,  while  scores  for  sludges 
and  solids  are  reduced.  The  scores  for  each  of  the  three  categories  are  then  added  and 
normalized  to  a  maximum  possible  score  of  100. 

The  USAF  Hazard  Assessment  Rating  Methodology  is  based  on  the  same  JRB  model  as 
the  EPA  HRS  method  and  is  similar  in  many  respects.  The  best  way  to  highlight  the  strengths 
and  weaknesses  of  the  USAF  ranking  method  is  to  identify  those  components  that  differ 
significantly  from  the  HRS  approach.  These  differences  are  found  in  the  areas  of: 

•  Waste  Quantity:  the  USAF  method  deals  more  realistically  with  the  quantities  of  toxic 
substances  by  having  “quantity”  indicate  the  total  amount  of  chemicals  in  a  particular 
hazard  classification. 

•  Persistence:  values  for  persistence  in  the  USAF  method  are  used  to  modify  the  waste 
characteristics  score  (based  on  toxicity  and  quantity).  This  may  be  inappropriate 
because  different  types  of  chemicals  contribute  to  the  overall  waste  characteristics 
score  (i.e.,  it  is  better  to  combine  toxicity  and  persistence  considerations  for  individual 
chemicals  as  done  in  the  HRS  than  to  apply  one  persistence  score  to  a  diverse  class  of 
chemicals). 

•  Air  Releases:  these  are  not  considered  in  the  USAF  ranking  method,  thus  the  potential 
risks  associated  with  a  site  could  be  underestimated. 

B.7.4  Relative  Hazard  Ranking  System 

Hazard  evaluations  for  toxic  chemicals  and  low-level  radioactive  wastes  have  generally 
been  performed  independently  of  one  another  and  without  a  means  of  comparison.  Exposure  of 
ecological  systems  to  ionizing  radiation  usually  results  in  nonspecific  damage,  while  exposure  to 
a  chemical  can  produce  specific  damage  to  a  specific  biologic  activity.  Comparing  radioactive 
hazards  with  chemical  hazards  is  difficult  because  of  differences  between  the  underlying 


B-22 


mechanisms  of  radiation  and  chemical  effects.  In  ranking  waste  disposal  sites  that  contain  a  mix 
of  chemical  and  radioactive  wastes,  a  relative  rating  of  chemical  hazard  and  radiation  effects  is 
necessary.  A  few  approaches  have  been  suggested  that  might  be  useful  in  comparing  relative 
hazards.  Four  of  these  approaches  are  summarized  in  Table  B-13. 

B.8  THE  AMOEBA  APPROACH 

AMOEBA  is  the  Dutch  acronym  for  “a  general  method  of  ecosystem  description  and 
assessment.”  The  AMOEBA  approach  is  based  on  the  concept  of  sustainable  development  and 
was  developed  for  and  applied  to  the  Dutch  Water  Management  Plan  (see  Kuik  and  Verbruggen, 
1991;  and  Udo  de  Haes,  Nip,  and  Klijn,  1991).  AMOEBA  is  a  conceptual  model  for  the 
development  of  quantitative  and  verifiable  ecological  objectives,  and  it  provides  a  means  for 
quantitatively  describing  and  assessing  ecosystems. 

The  AMOEBA  approach  employs  “ecological  values,”  which  are  defined  as  desired 
states  of  ecological  components  as  predetermined  by  decisionmakers  and/or  stakeholders.  In 
order  to  establish  precisely  these  ecological  values,  the  most  fundamental  values  humans 
attribute  to  plant  and  animal  life  are  examined.  Three  categories  of  ecological  characteristics  are 
used  in  deriving  ecological  values:

•  Production  and  Yield:  These  characteristics  are  valuable  for  functional  reasons.  This 
category  is  a  prerequisite  for  human  existence  (e.g.,  fisheries).  These  values  are  closely 
associated  with  the  abundance  of  species,  the  production  of  oxygen,  and  the  self- 
purifying  capacity. 

•  Species  Diversity:  This  is  valuable  for  ethical  amd  aesthetic  considerations.  It 
involves  concepts  such  as  the  preservation  of  species,  rarity,  and  completeness. 

•  Self-Regulation:  Self-regulation  has  ethical,  aesthetic/recreational,  and  economic 
considerations  that  are  closely  related  to  concepts  such  as  naturalness,  stability, 
intactness,  authenticity,  and  visual  integrity.  Moreover,  self-regulating  ecosystems 
have  low  management  costs  (Kuik  and  Verbruggen,  1991). 

AMOEBA-type  approaches  typically  present  three  values  for  each  study  parameter: 
reference  (baseline)  values,  target  (objective)  values,  and  current  (measured)  values.  The 
relationship  between  these  three  values  is  shown  in  Figure  B-1.  These  values  are  plotted  on  a 
circular  figure  for  each  parameter  (see  Udo  de  Haes,  Nip,  and  Klijn,  1991).  Determination  of 
these  three  values  is  integral  to  the  AMOEBA  approach. 

Reference  values  are  obtained  by  a  reference  system,  which  has  been  only  slightly 
influenced  by  human  activities  or  not  at  all.  Such  a  system  contains  the  conditions  for  the 
evolution  and  survival  of  organisms,  including  humans,  living  in  and  around  it.  The 
introduction  of  a  reference  system  provides  a  standard  against  which  an  assessment  of  the 
ecological  condition  of  a  system  can  be  made.  The  closer  one  can  come  to  mimicking  the 
reference  system,  the  larger  the  chance  of  ecological  sustainability.  The  overall  ecological 
objective,  however,  does  not  necessarily  have  to  coincide  with  the  reference  system. 

Decisionmakers  and/or  stakeholders  must  decide  on  the  maximum  acceptable  distance 
from  the  reference  point  to  establish  a  verifiable  ecological  objective.  This  distance  is  the  target 
value.  Target  values  may  both  exceed  or  fall  short  of  the  reference  values,  depending  on  the 
parameter.  The  compromise  between  the  ecological  quality  objective  (the  target  value)  and  the 
reference  value  is  evidenced  by  the  discrepancies  between  the  two  values. 

Current  or  measured  values  represent  the  actual  state  of  the  system.  Current  values  may 
be  determined  by  direct  measurement,  modeling,  or  through  secondary  data  sources.  The 
difference  between  the  target  values  and  the  current  value  indicates  the  extent  to  which  the 
ecological  objective  has  fallen  short  of  or  been  surpassed  by  either  an  existing  or  proposed 
activity.

A  case  study  example  using  the  AMOEBA  approach  is  provided  in  Udo  de  Haes,  Nip, 
and  Klijn  (1991). 

Strengths 

The  primary  strength  of  the  AMOEBA  approach  is  that  it  uses  actual  environmental 
conditions  as  baseline  information  against  which  to  estimate  the  environmental  implications  of  a 
project.  Such  an  assessment  can  provide  a  more  realistic  study  of  the  effects  of  a  project  on  the 
environment. 

Weaknesses 

A  weakness  of  the  AMOEBA  approach  is  that,  although  reference  environmental  values 
are  determined  relatively  objectively,  establishing  target  values  is  a  highly  subjective  process 
that  would  involve  consulting  experts  from  a  variety  of  different  fields  of  expertise.  In  addition, 
a  method  for  integrating  and  interpreting  the  effects  of  environmental  releases  from  other 
projects  is  not  clear. 

Relevance  to  Impact  Assessment 

In  the  context  of  impact  assessment,  the  AMOEBA  approach  may  be  useful  for 
estimating  the  extent  to  which  impacts  are  within  or  exceed  the  stakeholder-determined 
maximum  acceptable  values  (the  target  values)  from  environmental  reference  points. 


B-25 


In  addition,  because  the  current  values  represent  the  actual  state  of  the  system,  the 
difference  between  the  target  values  and  the  current  value  indicates  the  extent  to  which  the 
ecological  objective  has  fallen  short  of  or  been  surpassed  by  either  an  existing  or  proposed 
activity.  This  information  may  be  useful  for  highlighting  to  decisionmakers  the  compromise 
between  the  ecological  quality  objective  (the  target  value)  and  ambient  environmental  conditions 
(the  reference  value).

Impact  Assessment 


An  impact  of  concern  identified  from  a  variety  of  potential  impacts 
resulting  from  any  given  inventory  item.  Assessment  endpoints  are 
determined  based  on  the  goals  and  scope  of  the  LCA.  Groundwater 
depletion,  for  instance,  may  be  an  assessment  endpoint  associated 
with  a  quantity  of  groundwater  used  to  manufacture  of  paper 
products. 


The  process  whereby  inventory  data  are  assigned  to  impact 
categories  (e.g.,  photochemical  smog,  lung  disease,  fossil-fuel 
depletion)  under  primary  impact  groups  (e.g.,  ecosystem,  human 
health,  and  natural  resources).  For  example,  CO2  emissions  may  be 
classified  into  the  greenhouse  effect  category  under  primary 
ecosystem  impacts  group. 

Models  that  help  to  characterize  environmental  impacts  based  on  the 
data  obtained  from  an  inventory  analysis.  An  example  of  a 
conversion  model  is  the  Mackay  Unit  World  Model,  which  uses  a 
generic  computer  fate-and-exposure  model  to  characterize  the 
partitioning  and  transformations  of  chemical  substances  introduced 
into  a  hypothetical  1  km^  “ecosystem  box.” 

The  assessment  and  possible  estimation  of  the  magnitude  of 
environmental  impact.  Characterization  involves  the  use  of  specific 
impact  assessment  tools,  known  as  conversion  models  and  impact 
descriptors. 

A  potential  impact  that  is  directly  attributable  to  an  inventory  item. 
A  direct  impact  associated  with  ozone  emissions  could  be  photo¬ 
chemical  smog. 

A  discrete  activity  in  the  LCA  process,  which  may  be  reevaluated  or 
modified  at  any  point,  that  involves  defining  the  study  purpose  and 
objectives;  identifying  the  product,  process,  or  activity  of  interest; 
identifying  the  intended  end-use  of  study  results;  and  key 
assumptions  employed. 

A  potential  ecosystem,  human  health,  or  natural  resource  effect 
associated  with  an  inventory  item.  Acid  deposition,  for  instance, 
may  be  an  impact  to  the  natural  environment  associated  with  X  tons 
of  SO2  emissions  identified  in  the  inventory  analysis. 

A  quantitative  and/or  qualitative  process  to  classify,  characterize, 
and  value  impacts  to  ecosystems,  human  health,  and  natural 
resources  based  on  the  results  of  an  inventory  analysis.

Life-Cycle  Assessment 
(LCA) 


The  conceptual,  qualitative  linking  of  inventory  items  to  potential 
direct  and  indirect  impacts.  For  instance,  NO^  emissions  listed  in 
the  inventory  may  be  linked  to  acid  precipitation,  which  in  turn  may 
be  linked  to  tree  damage,  acidification  of  lakes,  soil  leaching,  and 
corrosion  of  materials. 

A  measure  or  set  of  significant  environmental  attributes  associated 
with  a  particular  impact  or  impact  category.  For  example,  a  CO2 
emissions  value  from  an  inventory  could  be  run  through  the 
appropriate  conversion  model  to  yield  the  potential  level  of 
greenhouse  gas  build  up  or  global  warming. 

A  process  to  identify  and  evaluate  opportunities  for  achieving 
improvements  in  products  and/or  processes  that  result  in  reduced 
environmental  effects,  based  on  the  results  of  an  inventory  analysis 
or  impact  assessment. 

A  potential  impact  that  is  not  directly  attributable  to  an  inventory 
item,  but  rather  stems  from  another  impact.  Human  respiratory 
damage,  for  instance,  could  be  indirect  impacts  of  photochemical 
smog,  which  is  a  direct  impact  of  ozone  emissions. 

A  raw  material,  energy,  or  other  resource  requirement  of  a  product 
system.  Inputs  may  include  the  amount  of  timber  required  to 
produce  1  ton  of  paper,  the  amount  of  natural  gas  required  per  unit 
of  plastic  production,  or  the  amount  of  soil  erosion  per  activity. 


A  process  of  identifying  and  quantifying,  to  the  extent  possible, 
resource  and  energy  inputs,  air  emissions,  waterborne  effluents, 
solid  waste,  and  other  inputs  and  outputs  throughout  the  life  cycle 
of  a  product  system.  The  inventory  may  include  such  items  as  the 
tons  of  CO2  released  per  unit  of  production,  the  amount  of  coal  per 
unit  of  production. 

A  holistic  approach  to  evaluating  the  environmental  burdens 
associated  with  a  product  system  by  identifying  inputs  from  and 
outputs  to  the  environment;  assessing  the  potential  impacts  of  those 
inputs  and  outputs  on  the  ecosystem,  human  health,  and  natural 
resources;  and  identifying  and  evaluating  opportunities  for 
achieving  improvements.  LCA  consists  of  four  complementary 
components — goal  definition  and  scoping,  inventory  analysis, 
impact  assessment,  and  improvement  assessment.

A  measurable  response  to  an  environmental  loading  that  may  act  as 
a  surrogate  measure,  quantitative  or  qualitative,  for  a  related 
assessment  endpoint.  For  example,  acid  precipitation  could  be  a 
possible  measurement  endpoint  for  the  assessment  endpoint  of  lost 
recreation  revenue  at  lake  X  that  is  indirectly  attributable  to 
emissions.  A  different  measurement  endpoint  for  this  scenario 
could  be  the  lost  recreation  revenue  at  lake  Y  due  to  emissions. 

The  concept  that  although  recognizing  any  single  inventory  item 
within  a  given  product  system  as  a  significant  contributor  to  specific 
impacts  is  difficult,  that  inventory  item  nonetheless  contributes  to 
impacts  when  placed  in  the  context  of  other  product  systems,  and 
may  therefore  need  to  be  considered  in  impact  assessment. 

Air  emissions,  waterborne  effluents,  solid  waste,  or  other  releases  to 
the  environment  associated  with  the  life  cycle  of  a  given  product 
system.  Outputs  can  include  the  quantity  of  CO2  released  per  unit  of 
production,  the  volume  of  solid  waste  per  unit  of  time,  and  the  level 
of  noise  or  odor  associated  with  a  particular  activity. 

An  operation  or  group  of  operations  associated  with  the  production 
of  a  product  or  service  that  has  clearly  delineated  input  and  output 
boundaries  and  includes  operations  associated  with  each  life-cycle 
stage.  The  product  system  associated  with  polyethylene  production, 
for  instance,  includes  not  only  the  company  manufacturing  the 
polyethylene,  but  all  of  the  intermediate  companies  that  produce  the 
materials  for  the  polyethylene  production,  such  as  the  oil  refinery 
and  a  natural  gas  transportation  company. 

The  explicit  and  collective  process  of  assigning  relative  values 
and/or  weights  to  potential  impacts  of  concern  (assessment 
endpoints).  Analytic  methods,  for  example,  such  as  the  Analytic 
Hierarchy  Process  (AHP)  may  be  used  to  estimate  the  relative 
importance  (value)  of  various  impacts  or  impact  categories  to 
multiattribute  decisions.

15.  SUPPLEMENTARY  NOTES 

16.  ABSTRACT 

Life-Cycle  Assessment  (LCA)  is  a  holistic  concept  and  approach  for  evaluating  i 

the  environmental  and  human  health  impacts  associated  with  a  product,  process,  or 
activity.  A  complete  LCA  looks  upstream  and  downstream,  identifies  inputs  and  outputs, 
and  assesses  the  potential  effects  of  those  inputs  and  outputs  on  ecosystems,  human 
health,  and  natural  resources. 

This  report  presents  a  conceptual  framework  for  conducting  a  life-cycle  impact 
assessment  (LCIA) ,  discusses  major  issues,  and  summarizes  existing  methods.  It  also 
identifies  some  of  the  advantages,  and  disadvantages  of  various  methods.
