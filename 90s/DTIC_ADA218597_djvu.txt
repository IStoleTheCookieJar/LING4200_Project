1.  Forward 


The  work  constituted  an  initial  part  of  a  3  year  program  on  "Defect 
Engineering  in  GaAs..".  This  part  realized  at  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of 
Technology  was  terminated  on  October  14,  1989.  The  work  was  focused  on 
the  role  of  the  EL2  defect  and  native  shallow  acceptors  in  the  engineering  of 
GaAs  resistivity  and  thermal  conversion  characteristics.  The  program  was 
interrupted  by  a  transfer  of  the  principal  investigator  (J.L.)  to  EE 
Department  of  the  University  of  South  Florida  (USF) 

2.  Results: 


The  project  was  initiated  on  February  15,  1989.  In  accord  with  the 
Statement  of  Work,  our  research  was  focused  on  the  engineering  of  the  EL2 
defect  in  GaAs  employing  nonstoichiometric  crystal  growth  and  annealing 
rapid  cooling  treatments.  We  have  completed  a  series  of  very  high 
temperature  annealing  of  Ga-rich  samples  at  temperatures  only  about  10°  C 
below  the  GaAs  melting  point.  Prior  to  annealing,  Ga-rich  samples 
contained  virtually  no  EL2  (below  1015  cm-3)  and  our  experiments  were 
designed  to  answer  the  question  of  whether  EL2  can  be  formed  via 
annealing  in  As-rich  ambient. 

Samples  were  characterized  using  the  near  infrared  optical  absorption 
in  the  range  2  to  0.8  mm  (whereby  characteristic  optical  transitions  via  the 
EL2  defect  take  place).  Very  high  sensitivity  measurements  which  included 
optical  bleaching  and  thermal  recovery  cycling  between  4K  and  140K 
showed  no  EL2  absorption  in  (0);  (1+)  and  (2+)  states  at  a  level  exceeding 
1013  centers/cm3.  DLTS  measurements  of  0/(1+)  EL2  level  (electron, 
trap)  and  1+/2+  level  (hole  trap)  yielded  similar  results.  Therefore  we 
conclude  that  EL2  is  not  formed  in  Ga-rich  crystals  even  during  100  hours 
long  annealing  at  1300OC  in  As  overpressure. 

We  have  completed  a  detailed  theoretical  analysis  of  the  engineering  of 
GaAs  resistivity.  In  the  approach  we  used  our  refined  empirical 
relationships  between  the  concentration  of  a  native  EL2  double  donor  and 
the  concentrations  of  native  acceptors  determined  as  a  function  of 
engineering  parameters,  namely,  the  growth  melt  stoichiometry  and  the 
crystal  cooling  rate.  Residual  carbon  acceptors  were  also  introduced  in  our 
model.  The  results  show  that  all  essential  GaAs  parameters,  i.e.,  the 
resistivity  value,  the  semiconducting-semi-insulating  transition  point,  and 
the  margin  for  heavy  metal  contaminants,  could  be  controlled  by  controlling 
the  arsenic  atom  fraction  in  the  melt  and/or  the  rate  of  crystal  colling 
between  10000C  and  700°C.  The  results  were  presented  at  the  Electronic 
Materials  Conference  in  Boston,  June  19-24,  1989,  and  they  are  under 
preparation  for  publication  in  the  Journal  of  Applied  Physics. 
Representative  theoretical  data  are  shown  in  the  enclosed  figure  1.  They 
are  an  excellent  aggreement  with  experimental  data. 


Our  experimental  study  indicated  very  important  role  of  the  native 
acceptor  located  at  68mev  above  the  valence  band.  This  single  acceptor 
center  becomes  dominant  under  Ga-rieh  crystals.  However  the  presence  of 
68  meV  acceptor  has  not  been  documented  by  previous  measurements. 
Accordingly  we  prepared  a  series  of  samples  suitable  for  electronic  Raman 
spectroscopy  measurements.  The  measurements  were  performed  by  Dr. 
Wagner  at  the  Fraunhofer  Institute  in  Freiburg,  Germany.  Results  confirmed 
the  presence  of  68  meV  via  observation  of  new  505  cm-i  Raman  line 
corresponding  to  Is -2s  excitation.  The  strength  of  the  line  correlates  with 
the  acceptor  concentration  determined  by  us  from  DLTS  measurements. 
Binding  energies  estimated  from  both  measurements  are  also  in  good 
agreement.  The  results  are  being  prepared  for  publication. 

In  addition  to  basic  research  involvement  we  have  also  performed 
service  type  tasks  supplying  unique  ITC  GaAs  samples  to  other  laboratories. 
A  series  of  samples  were  prepared,  and  characterized  for  the  Forth  Momuth 
Laboratory  researchers  namely  Mr.  Burk  (optical  switching)  and  Dr. 
Poindexter  (paramagnetic  resonance  study).
