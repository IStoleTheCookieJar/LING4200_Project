4  Lessee  is  hereby  granted  the  right,  at  its  option,  to  pool  or  unitize  any  land  covered  by  this  lease  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this 
lease  and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease,  or  leases,  as  to  any  or  all  minerals  or  horizons,  so  as  to  establish  units  containing  not  more  than  80 
surface  acres  plus  1 0%  acreage  tolerance;  provided,  however,  units  may  be  established  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  or  existing  units  may  be 
enlarged  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  so  as  to  contain  not  more  than  640  surface  acres  plus  *f0%  acreage  tolerance,  if  limited  to  one  or  more 
of  the  following:  (1)  gas,  other  than  casinghead  gas,  (2)  liquid  hydrocarbons  (condensate)  which  are  not  liquids  in  the  subsurface  reservoir,  (3) 
minerals  produced  from  wells  classified  as  gas  wells  by  the  conservation  agency  having  junsdiction.  If  larger  units  than  any  of  those  herein 
permitted;  either  at  the  time  established,  or  after  enlargement,  are  permitted  or  required  under  any  governmental  rule  or  order,  for  the  drilling  or 
operation  of  a  well  at  a  regular  location,  or  for  obtaining  maximum  allowable  from  any  well  to  be  drilled,  drilling,  or  already  dnlled,  any  such  unit 
may  be  established  or  enlarged  to  conform  to  the  size  permitted  or  required  by  such  governmental  order  or  rule.  Lessee  shall  exercise  said 
option  as  to  each  desired  unit  by  executing  an  instrument  identifying  such  unit  and  filing  it  for  record  in  the  public  office  in  which  this  lease  is 
recorded.  Such  unit  shall  become  effective  as  of  the  date  provided  for  in  said  instrument  or  instruments  but  if  said  instrument  or  instrumente 
make  no  such  provision,  then  such  unit  shall  become  effective  on  the  date  such  instrument  or  instruments  are  so  filed  of  record.  Each  of  said 
options  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force,  and  whether  before  or  after  operations  or 
production  has  been  established  either  on  said  land,  or  on  the  portion  of  said  land  included  in  the  unit,  or  on  other  land  unrhzed  therewith.  A  unrt 
established  hereunder  shall  be  valid  and  effective  for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  even  though  there  may  be  mineral,  royalty,  or  leasehold 
interests  in  lands  within  the  unit  which  are  not  effectively  pooled  or  unitized.  Any  operations  conducted  on  any  part  of  such  unitized  land  shall 
be  considered,  for  all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of  royalty,  operations  conducted  upon  said  land  under  this  lease.  There  shall  be  alkwated 
to  the  land  covered  by  this  lease  within  each  such  unit  (or  to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the 
unit)  that  proportion  of  the  total  production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  unit,  after  deducting  any  used  in  lease  or  unit  operations,  which  the 
number  of  surface  acres  in  such  land  (or  in  each  such  separate  tract)  covered  by  this  lease  within  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface 
acres  in  the  unit,  and  the  production  so  allocated  shall  be  considered  for  all  purposes,  including  payment  or  delivery  of  royalty,  overnding  royalty 
and  any  other  payments  out  of  production,  to  be  the  entire  production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  land  to  which  allocated  in  the  same  manner 
as  though  produced  therefrom  under  the  terms  of  this  lease.  The  owner  of  the  reversionary  estate  of  any  term  royalty  or  mineral  estate  agrees 
that  the  accrual  of  royalties  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  or  of  shut-in  royalties  from  a  well  on  the  unit  shall  satisfy  any  limitation  of  term  requiring 
production  of  oil  or  gas.  The  formation  of  any  unit  hereunder  which  includes  land  not  covered  by  this  lease  shall  not  have  the  effect  of  exchanging 
or  transferring  any  interest  under  this  lease  (including,  without  limitation,  any  shut-in  royalty  which  may  become  payable  under  this  tease)  between 
parties  owning  interests  in  land  covered  by  this  lease  and  parties  owning  interests  in  land  not  covered  by  this  lease.  Neither  shall  it  impair  the  right 
of  Lessee  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof,  except  that  Lessee  may  not  so  release  as  to  lands  within  a  unit  while  there  are 
operations  thereon  for  unitized  minerals  unless  all  pooled  leases  are  released  as  to  lands  within  the  unit  At  any  time  while  this  tease  is  in  force 
Lessee  may  dissolve  any  unit  established  hereunder  by  filing  for  record  in  the  public  office  where  this  lease  is  recorded  a  declaration  to  that 
effect,  if  at  that  time  there  is  no  unitized  minerals  being  produced  from  such  unit.  Any  unit  formed  may  be  amended,  re-formed,  reduced  or 
enlarged  by  Lessee  at  its  election  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  after  the  original  forming  thereof  by  filing  an  appropriate  instrument  of 
record  in  trie  public  office  in  which  the  pooled  acreage  is  located.  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph  4,  a  unit  once  established 
hereunder  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  lease  subject  thereto  shall  remain  in  force.  If  this  lease  now  orhereafter  covers  separate  tracts, 
no  pooling  or  unitization  of  royalty  interests  as  between  any  such  separate  tracts  is  intended  or  shall  be  implied  or  result  merely  from  the 
inclusion  of  such  separate  tracts  within  this  lease  but  Lessee  shall  nevertheless  have  the  right  to  pool  or  unitize  as  provided  in  this  paragraph 
4  with  consequent  allocation  of  production  as  herein  provided.  As  used  in  this  paragraph  4,  the  words  "separate  tract"  mean  any  tract  with 
royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from  that  as  to  any  other  part  of  the  leased  premises.

part  or  all  of  said  land  or  of  any  mineral  or  horizon  thereunder,  and  thereby  be  relieved  of  all  obligations,  as  to  the  released  acreage  or  interest.

all  operations  hereunder.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  to  remove  all  machinery  and  fixtures  placed  on  said  land,  including  the  right  to 
draw  and  remove  casing.  No  well  shall  be  drilled  nearer  than  200  feet  to  the  house  or  bam  now  on  said  land  without  the  consent  of  the  Lessor. 
Lessee  shall  pay  for  damages  caused  by  its  operations  to  growing  crops  and  timber  on  said  land. 

8  The  rights  and  estate  of  any  party  hereto  may  be  assigned  from  time  to  time  in  whole  or  in  part  and  as  to  any  mineral  or  horizon.  All  of 
the  covenants,  obligations,  and  considerations  of  this  lease  shall  extend  to  and  be  binding  upon  the  parties  hereto,  their  heirs,  successors, 
assiqns  and  successive  assigns.  No  change  or  division  in  the  ownership  of  said  land,  royalties,  or  other  moneys,  or  any  part  thereof, 
howsoever  effected  shall  increase  the  obligations  or  diminish  the  rights  of  Lessee,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  location  and  drilling  of  wells 
and  the  measurement  of  production.  Notwithstanding  any  other  actual  or  constructive  Knowledge  or  notice  thereof  of  or  to  Lessee,  its 
successors  or  assigns,  no  change  or  division  in  the  ownership  of  said  land  or  of  the  royalties,  or  other  moneys,  or  the  nght  to  receive  the 
same  howsoever  effected,  shalfbe  binding  upon  the  then  record  owner  of  this  lease  until  sixty  (60)  days  after  there  has  been  furnished  to 
such  record  owner  at  his  or  its  principal  place  of  business  by  Lessor  or  Lessor's  heirs,  successors,  or  assigns,  notice  of  such  change  or 
division  supported  by  either  originals  or  duly  certified  copies  of  the  instruments  which  have  been  properly  filed  for  record  and  which  evidence 
such  change  or  division,  and  of  such  court  records  and  proceedings,  transcripts,  or  other  documents  as  shall  be  necessary  in  the  opinion  of 
such  record  owner  to  establish  the  validity  of  such  change  or  division.  If  any  such  change  in  ownership  occurs  by  reason  of  the  death  of  the 
owner,  Lessee  may,  nevertheless  pay  or  tender  such  royalties,  or  other  moneys,  or  part  thereof,  to  the  credit  of  the  decedent  in  a  depository 
bank  provided  for  above. 

9  In  the  event  Lessor  considers  that  Lessee  has  not  complied  with  all  its  obligations  hereunder,  both  express  and  implied.  Lessor  shaH 
notify  Lessee  in  writing,  setting  out  specifically  in  what  respects  Lessee  has  breached  this  contract.  Lessee  shall  then  have  sixty  (60)  days  after 
receipt  of  said  notice  within  which  to  meet  or  commence  to  meet  all  or  any  part  of  the  breaches  alleged  by  Lessor.  The  service  of  saw  notice 
shall  be  precedent  to  the  bringing  of  any  action  by  Lessor  on  said  tease  for  any  cause,  and  no  such  action  shall  be  brought  until  the  lapse  of 
sixty  (60)  days  after  service  ofsuch  notice  on  Lessee.  Neither  the  service  of  said  notice  nor  the  doing  of  any  acts  by  Lessee  aimed  to  meet  all  or 
any  of  the  alleged  breaches  shall  be  deemed  an  admission  or  presumption  that  Lessee  has  failed  to  perform  all  its  obligations  hereunder.  If  this 
lease  is  canceled  for  any  cause,  it  shall  nevertheless  remain  in  force  and  effect  as  to  (1 )  sufficient  acreage  around  each  well  as  to  which  there  are 
operations  to  constitute  a  drilling  or  maximum  allowable  unit  under  applicable  governmental  regulations,  (but  in  no  event  less  that  forty  acres), 
such  acreage  to  be  designated  by  Lessee  as  nearly  as  practicable  in  the  form  of  a  square  centered  at  the  well,  or  in  such  shape  as  then 
existing  spacing  rules  require;  and  (2)  any  part  of  said  land  included  in  a  pooled  unit  on  which  there  are  operations.  Lessee  shall  also  nave  such 
easements  on  said  land  as  are  necessary  to  operations  on  the  acreage  so  retained  and  shall  not  be  required  to  move  or  remove  any  existing 
surface  facilities  necessary  or  convenient  for  current  operations. 

10  Lessor  hereby  warrants  and  agrees  to  defend  title  to  said  land  against  the  claims  of  all  persons  whomsoever.  Lessor's  rights  and 
interests  hereunder  shall  be  charged  pnmarily  with  any  mortgages,  taxes  or  other  liens,  or  interest  and  other  charges  on  said  land,  but  Lessor 
agrees  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  to  pay  or  reduce  same  for  Lessor,  either  before  or  after  maturity,  and  be  subrogated  to  the 
rights  of  the  holder  thereof  and  to  deduct  amounts  so  paid  from  royalties  or  other  payments  payable  or  which  may  become  payabfetoLessor 
and/or  assigns  under  this  lease.  If  this  lease  covers  a  less  interest  in  the  oil,  gas,  sulphur,  or  other  minerals  in  all  or  any  part  of  said  land  than  the 
entire  and  undivided  fee  simple  estate  (whether  Lessor's  interest  is  herein  specified  or  not),  or  no  interest  therein,  then  the  royalties  and  other 
moneys  accruing  from  any  part  as  to  which  this  lease  covers  less  than  such  full  interest  shall  be  paid  only  in  the  proportion  which  the  interest 
therein,  if  any,  covered  by  this  lease,  bears  to  the  whole  and  undivided  fee  simple  estate  therein.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease 
(whether  or  not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  This  lease  shall  be  binding  upon  each  party  who  executes  it 
without  regard  to  whether  it  is  executed  by  all  those  named  herein  as  Lessor. 

1 1  If  while  this  lease  is  in  force,  at,  or  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  hereof,  it  is  not  being  continued  in  force  by  reason  of  the  shut-in 
well  provisions  of  paragraph  3  hereof,  and  Lessee  is  not  conducting  operations  on  said  land  by  reason  of  (1)  any  law,  order,  rule  or  regulation, 
(whether  or  not  subsequently  determined  to  be  invalid)  or  (2)  any  other  cause,  whether  similar  or  dissimilar,  (except  financial)  beyond  the 
reasonable  control  of  Lessee,  the  primary  term  hereof  shall  be  extended  until  the  first  anniversary  date  hereof  occurring  ninety  (90)  or  more 
days  following  the  removal  of  such  delaying  cause,  and  this  lease  may  be  extended  thereafter  by  operations  as  if  such  delay  had  not 
occurred. 

12.  Lessor  agrees  that  this  tease  covers  and  includes  any  and  all  of  Lessor's  rights  in  and  to  any  existing  well(s)  and/or  wellbore(s)  on  said 
land,  other  than  existing  water  wells,  and  for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  the  re-entry  and  use  by  Lessee  of  any  existing  well  and/or  wellbore  shall  be 
deemed  the  same  as  the  drilling  of  a  new  well. 

1 3.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  lease,  at  the  option  of  Lessee,  which  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee 
giving  notice  to  Lessor,  a  well  which  has  been  drilled  and  Lessee  intends  to  frac  shall  be  deemed  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying 
quantities  and  the  date  such  well  is  shut-in  shall  be  when  the  drilling  operations  are  completed. 

14  As  a  result  of  land  development  in  the  vicinity  of  said  land,  governmental  rules  or  ordinances  regarding  well  sites,  and/or  surface 
restrictions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  this  lease  and/or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity,  surface  locations  for  well  sites  in  the  vicinity  may  be  limited  and 
Lessee  may  encounter  difficulty  securing  surface  locations)  for  drilling,  reworking  or  other  operations.  Therefore,  since  drilling,  reworking  or  other 
operations  are  either  restricted  or  not  allowed  on  said  land  or  otherteases  in  the  vicinity,  it  is  agreed  that  any  such  operations  conducted  at  a 
surface  location  off  of  said  land  or  off  of  lands  with  which  said  land  are  pooled  in  accordance  with  this  lease,  provided  that  such  operations  are 
associated  with  a  directional  well  for  the  purpose  of  drilling,  reworking,  producing  or  other  operations  under  said  land  or  lands  pooled  therewith, 
shall  for  purposes  of  this  lease  be  deemed  operations  conducted  on  said  land.  Nothing  contained  in  this  paragraph  is  intended  to  modify  any 
surface  restnctions  or  pooling  provisions  or  restrictions  contained  in  this  lease,  except  as  expressly  stated. 

15  It  is  the  desire  of  Lessee  to  obtain  from  Lessor  an  Option  to  Extend  the  term  of  this  lease  for  an  additional  two  years  from  the  expiration
