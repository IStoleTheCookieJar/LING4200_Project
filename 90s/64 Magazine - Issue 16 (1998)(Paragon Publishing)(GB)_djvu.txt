Welcome! 


Only three people - well, two people 
and their dog - can stop Mizar’s 
advance. Juno, Vela and carnage¬ 
committing canine Lupus make up the 
titular twin-related jet Force, and it’s 
down to them to blast Mizar and his 
bugs straight to hell! 

The all-action shoot-’em-up takes 
place across a number of 3-D worlds, 
and players have to switch between 
the three main characters - each of 
whom has different special abilities - 
to uncover secret areas and solve 
puzzles that block the team’s 


It Pciys To 
Be Pdtient 


All of a sudden, the N 64 market is 
set for a dramatic upturn. Banjo- 
Kazooie arrived this issue and turned 
out to be even better than anyone had 
expected (and since it was a Rare title, 
we already had pretty high hopes for 
it); Mortal Kombat 4 proves that the 
N64 can handle a decent fighting 
game; the Japanese version of ISS *98 
moves the goalposts once again for 
what a great sport sim should be like; 
All-Star Baseball stunned us with its 
combination of playability (even of a 
weird American sport) and 
spectacular visuals. 

It’s not going to stop, either. Due to 
drop into our cartridge slots over the 
next few months are F-Zero X, Turok 2, 
Body Harvest and Wipeout 64, all of 
which push the boundaries of what 
the N64 can do in their own different 
ways, and after that we can look 
forward to Ft World Grand Prix, 

Perfect Dark and - dare we hope? - 
the Titanic of videogames, Zelda 64. 

We’ve certainly had to wait long I 
enough, but after more than two 
years, developers have finally got 
to grips with the N64’s powerful 
but complicated innards and have 1 
started to produce games where 
quality is the rule, not just the 
exception. ^ 

If you want proof of this, 1 

compare the early N64 titles - 
even Nintendo’s own - to what’s 
appearing now. Then imagine 
what developers will be coming 
up with this time next year. If you ^ 
think the games of today are ■ 
awesome, you’d better get a I 

100,000 mile service on your H 

adrenaline glands before next H 

year - you don’t want to H 

overstress them. 

There are still a few gaps in 
the N64 ’s software line-up - ^ 

MK4 may be good, but it’s still 
no Tekken 3 or SFAlpha 2, and 
for high-speed racing thrills 
Nintendo’s machine is still I 
lagging behind the 
PlayStation. But with the 
standards rising so high in 
other areas, there’s no reason 

to believe this situation will I _ 

remain the same for long. 

The patience of N64 gamers 
is about to be rewarded... I

More news on Rare’s/et Force 
Geminil We had a bit of info on this 
new game in last issue’s E3 report, 
but because the game was only 
shown on a brief video clip we 
couldn’t say much about it. 

The plot of Jet Force Gemini has the 
evil Mizar (why are villains always 
evil? Why aren’t there any who are 
just a bit 

insensitive?) trying to 
take over the entire 
galaxy, with the help 
of his countless 
insectoid minions. 





























Fi NGS ARE 
LOOKING GOOD 




FI World Grand Prix, being programmed by 
Pilotwings developers Paradigm for Video Systems, has 
now been picked up by Nintendo for release in Britain 
and America. The impressive-looking game should go on 
sale at the end of july in the States and possibly as early 
as August over here, assuming Nintendo manage to get 
Bernie Ecclestone to sign on the dotted line. 




progress. Rare promise some 
ridiculously destructive weapons, the 
explosive results of which you can see 
in some of their shots here, and the 
option for players to set the Al of the 
enemies from cannon-fodder-dumb to 
exoskeletal-Einstein. 

On top of all that, there will also be 
multiplayer modes - caring sharing 


types can play through Jet Force 
Gemini In a co-operative mode, while 
those with itchy trigger fingers and a 
penchant for inflicting pain on their 
friends in Goldeneye and roshambo 
evenings can unleash improbable 
weapons on each other in the 
deathmatch game. 

We’ll have more on Jet Force 
Gemini soon!

EARTHBOUND 
CART 
BOUND 

High on the list of *wow, gee, we 
never expected that news items 
comes the announcement that 
Earthbound, otherwise known as 



TanxA 

Million 

Remember 3DO, the console that 
was supposed to take over the world 
but turned out to be as big a duffer as 
the Atari jaguar? 3DO. the company, 
has realised the error of its ways and 
has switched to making games 
instead of overpriced, underspecced 
hardware, and their first N64 title will 



Mother has been moved from 
64DD to cartridge. Earthbountfs new 
silicon home will be the same size as 
Zelda 64, 256Mbits (32 Mb) - half the 
size of its intended 64DD disk. 

This is good news for Western 
gamers, because the transfer to 
cartridge vastly increases the game’s 
chances of receiving an English 
translation. Earthbound will be the 
machine’s first ‘traditional’ RPG, as 
opposed to the action>oriented 
approach of Zelda and Quest 64 (see 
page 52): although the world and 


chorocters ore presented in 3 D, the 

Story progresses more like Final 
Fantasy W/, with multiple characters, 
problems to solve and a plot stretching 
over several years. 

On the other hand, it’s another nail 
In the coffin for the 64DD, since 
Earthbound was intended to be one of 
the leading games for the new add*on. 
Although Nintendo promise a mission 
disk that will add new adventures to 
the cartridge version, this is likely to 
be a japan-only release - assuming 
the 64DD is ever launched. 


Gap-tootnco Brazilian soccer 
sensation Ronaldo has been signed by 
France - not for the national team, but 
by Infogrames, who plan to release a

this year... Take 2 Interactive are to

monster truck racing game 
programmed by Gathering Of

former coders from the likes of Iguana 
and Paradigm... Australian softco 
Beam Software may convert PC title 
DethCarz, a Mad Max-style racer, to 
the N64. GT Interactive will be 
distributing the game late next year... 
Mike Piazza’s Strike Zone is now 
unlikely to get a UK release, on the 
understandable grounds that nobody 
over here plays baseball... 


ASCHWHEEL 64 

£40 (TBC) • ASCII • (01273) 821104 


There seem to be almost as many 
steering wheels for the N64 as there 
are driving games. ASCII’s new wheel 
is a little different from the others on 
the market, dispensing with pedals 
altogether in favour of a more 
compact desktop unit. 

It‘s no surprise that the 
ASCIlWheel 64 comes from japan, 
where space is at a premium - the 
footprints of some N64 wheels would 
probably fill most Akihabara game 
shops! The whole unit folds into a 
space not that much bigger than an 


N64, which should come as a relief 
for those with cramped rooms. 

By chucking out pedals, ASCII’s 
wheel doesn’t suffer from the 
hassles of control reallocation like 
most of its competitors - all the 
buttons are right there on the wheel 
itself. Only the L button is out of 
immediate reach, but how many 
games use it in play? 

We tested it with our usual bunch 
of games - Mario Kart, Diddy Kong 
Racing and Top Gear Rally. We have 
yet to find a single wheel that adds 


anything to TGR (they all make the 
cars insanely over-responsive), but 
on Mario and Diddy It performed very 
well. Having the up-down analogue 
control right under your thumb is the 
best positioning on any wheel, and 
makes Diddy a snap to play. 

The ASCIlWheel Is as good as any 
N64 wheel around, and its small size 
(and low price) makes it a top choice 
for space-starved and price- 
conscious racers. 

64 Magazine Rating: 


be DdttlctanA . 

Set in a post-apocalyptic future 
where a small number of surviving 
women called Queen-Lords rule over 
armies of men, opposing tribes roam 
through ruined cities looking for 
women - the more women a tribe has, 
the more power it holds. The chosen 
weapon of all the tribes is... the tank. 

Tanks being what they are, huge 
heavy objects with massive guns, 
you’d expect a fair bit of destruction. 
And you’d be right. The buildings in 
each city aren’t just obstacles - they 
can be blown apart to make 
impromptu escape routes and reveal 
secret areas. The tanks can be 
powered up with all kinds of weapons, 
from flamethrowers to railguns, and 
for maximum sterility potential there’s 
even a nuke that can flatten half a city! 

Battletanx will also have a battle 
mode, with up to four players 
pumping armour-piercing rounds into 
each other. Sounds like fun! 
Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait 
until next year before we can hear 
the heavy metal thunder.

Cruis'n For 
A Bruis'n 


What the duh? Nintendo have gone 
completely insane, pushing back the 
Western release of F-Zero X to 
October in the States. November over 
here, so that they can drop in, er... 
Cruis'n World. 

While we can understand the logic 
behind this - nobody would want to 
buy Cruis'n World if they could 
already get F-Zero instead - there is a 
slight problem in that, based on what 
we saw at E3 last issue, Cruis'n World 
is pants. 



Should you want to buy Cruis'n 
World, you'll be able to buy it this 
month. But then, you'll be able to buy 
Banjo-Kazooie this month as well, and 
we know which one we’d spend our 
hard-earned on. Clue: it's the one with 
the bear and the bird. 

All is not lost - we’ll have the first 
review of the Japanese version of F- 
Zero X next issue! 


OGREGASM 


Wargamers who have felt left out by the N64's lack of strategy- 
minded software could be in for a treat when Japanese company Quest 
release Ogre Battle 3 later this year. The game is a fantasy battle title, where 
armies of knights, wizards, dragons and - yes! - ogres fight to the death. As 
supreme commander, the player has to organise his magical legions and 
build up their powers through a mix of training and bloody combat. 

At the moment, no Western publisher has snapped up Ogre Battle 3, so 
unless somebody gets moving fast there may be an awful lot of Japanese 
text to hack through!

As 1 write, England have just 
beaten Columbia to go through to 
the second round of the World 
Cup, so it’s no surprise that EA’s 
game is still over the moon. 
Forsaken has jumped in right 
behind it, with Goldeneye still 
clinging on to the third position. 
Good results for the low-priced 
pair of ISS 64 and Wetrix as well. 

Konami’s Mystical Ninja drops 
sharply; presumably the hardcore 
adventure gamers all bought it in 


This Last 
Month Month 


its first month on sale. 
Surprisingly, Quake continues to 
plunge as well - perhaps classic 
status on the PC doesn’t count for 
much on the N64! DiddyKong 
Racing's drop down the charts is 
also a bit unexpected as well. 

As for next month’s chart, who 
knows? Banjo-Kazooie isn’t due 
out until just after issue 17 goes to 
the printers, so will World Cup 'g8 
continue to dominate? Find out

No, Not Price Again! 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

I must admit, as reader of several 
N64 magazines, the speech in issue 
14 on page six was absolutely 
brilliant. Every single word you printed 
was truthful, your comments about other 
magazines are very realistic and after frantically 
searching through them I saw the light! I 
discovered you were the magazine 1 wanted, to 
infinity and beyond. I thought the article was very 
honest and it must have taken an awful lot of balls 
to print it. 

Mind you. I’ve noticed that whenever anybody 
mentions your magazine at a lower price, you 


either ignore it or you... ignore it. Why are 
you scared to talk about the expensive 
price of your mag? 

Adam Kelwick, Sheffield 

Ah, the price of the mag - hey, look! Over 
there! It’s the Goodyear blimp! 

Actually, because 64 Magazine was the first 
N64 mag on the market and because the N64 
was, at its launch, a premium-priced machine, 
the cover price was set accordingly, and it’s sort 
of, urn, stayed that way. 1 did ask the bosses 
about cutting the price to £1.50, but they hit me 
with a fish. We’re looking into the possibility of 
bringing the price down at a future date.

Demon Seeds 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

Nintendo’s ’Kiddie Console’ policy is a bag of shite. 
They seem to want a lot of games that are easy to 
complete (Vbs/i/’s Story, Mario 64, Mario Kart, Lylat 
Wars) and are also encouraging third-party 
developers to do the same {Blast Corps, Twelve 
Tales: Conker 64, Rampage) so they will be 
attractive to the younger generation (7-12 year 
olds). 1 think that they must put a stop to this policy, 
if they want to sell more games. 

Children nowadays are completely different to 
what they were in the time of the excellent NES. 
They grow up with better reaction and co-ordination 
skills thanks to new toys which are coming out. 
Therefore, when they reach the age when they start 
to play computer games, they are more developed 
in their computing skills and find them easier than 1 
did when 1 was that age (1 am 16). This is proven by 
the fact that if you gave a child an Atari with a game 
that you found hard during your childhood, they 
would finish it in a matter of hours. I therefore think 
that Nintendo should scrap their ‘Kiddie Console’ 
policy and realise that the human race is evolving! 
Bob Kalisiak, email 

Another thing that Nintendo seem to be ignoring is 
the fact that gamers who used to play Mario games 
on the NES and SNES are now several years older 
and may not want to play fairyland games starring 
a happy plumber. They say that by concentrating 
on younger players they're creating the next 
generation of gamers, but it*^ not much use if they 
all desert Nintendo when they reach 14 so they can 
explode heads on someone else’s console! 


It Was The Man With 
The Golden Gun 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

I want to ask why so many magazines (not you) 
provoke attacks on other consoles. Why are people 
so obsessed by supporting just the one console? I 
mean, a good game is a good game whichever 
format it’s on. It’s a bit like football - the players get 
swapped over to so many teams that supporting 
just the one will eventually become senseless. 

I also want to know why Oddjob is so short in 
Goldeneye. In Goldfinger he was quite a tall man. I 
think (heaven forbid) that Rare have made a mistake 
and confused him with Nick Nack (not the crisps) 
from the Roger Moore film, who had that big laser 
(or something). 

Cem Surer, Purley 

It's a psychology thing > after spending money on 
something, people have to justify it by saying it's 
infinitely better than the alternatives, whether it is 
or not. This is why you get people frantically trying 
to convince you of the merits of the Vauxhall Tigra 
or Stride Statik trainers that look like yellow 
neutronium moonboots. 

We called up Rare to ask about Oddjob. Their 
response: “Look! It's the Goodyear blimp!" (click- 
brnTrrrrr) 

Goldeneye Rip-Off Shocker 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

Last weekend I rented the james Bond film 
Goldeneye from my local video shop. I think it’s 
ridiculous that this film company is able to produce 
a blatant carbon copy of our beloved N64 game 
Goldeneye. Not only did they copy the locations, 
but they cleverly managed to find actors who were 
dead ringers for the characters in the game. This is 
obviously a breach of copyright and I hope you can 
pass on my observations to Rare so that they can 
take the matter to higher authorities. Hopefully 
Rare will prevent any further leakages of future 
game plots to prevent this kind of atrocity 
happening again. 

Torfinn and Kristoffer ThorbjDrnsen, Kircaldy 

You've got to admire the sheer nerve of MGM/UA 
and Eon Productions. Those magnificent bastards! 



U Sexy Mother 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

how is the blood in Mission Impassable is it like 
when u shoot the the blood doesnt squirt out like 
golden eye or is it like when u shoot them blood 
comes out and one more thing when u kill the people 
do they fade away or do they stay on the floor 
G789Base@aol.com. email 

My god! An email from The Artist Formally Known 
As Prince! Well, your squiggleness. I don't 
remember seeing any blood in the E3 demo of 
Mission: Impossible (see last issue), so your blood 
lust will probably be unsatisfied. If u want spouting 
blood, try Bio Freaks or wait 4 Turok 2! 

Lashing Lamentable Losers 

Dear 64 Magazine. 

t was reading issue 14 and looking through the 
‘When I’m 64’ section when I came across the 
‘Memory Card Losers* column. The first letter from 
Phillip Graham was nothing special, but the second 
one was from a bloke called Matos. I thought he 
was an absolute pratt! He was complaining about 
the games you could choose from when you 
subscribe {Goldeneye, Mario 64, Mario Kart and 
Diddy Kong Racing). His complaint was that the 
games selected were the worst games ever - bear 
in mind they all got over 85%. How can they be the 
worst games ever? 

The second letter, from Lee O’Connor in 
Ballymena, was just as bad. He was complaining 
about swearing in this magazine. Most magazines 
have this kind of swearing in them. If he’s got a 
problem with the fine content of this magazine, then 
maybe he should buy a comic! 

Right, that’s it. complaint over. Your magazine 
really rocks! 

Ryan Williams, Poole 

We suspect that Matos was. in Internet parlance, 
trolling* - being deliberately annoying to provoke a 
response and make himself feel important. Either 
that, or he’s a complete goon who wouldn’t know a 
decent game if it bit him on the arse. 


Letters 


Obviously after all that thinking, I got onto the 
line of thought about my top ten nightmare list, ie 
games I wish nobody had ever made, and will never 
make, and oh GOD PLEASE DON’T MAKE THIS... 

1. Tamagotchi World. 

2. Anything else to do with Tamagotchi(s). 

3. Turok 2 (give up, it was crap the first time). 

4. Yoshi*s Story 2 (for this read no more fluffy, furry, 
cutsie little wunk bags, and definitely no more 
games pitched at three-year-olds). 

5. Wheel Of Fortune (please get a life!) 

6. NBA, NFL, NHL, etc etc - let America keep its 
crappy sports games, and we promise not to give 
them any of ours. 

7. The Glory Of St Andrews. 

8. Doom 64 (that used to be a good game, that did - 
three years ago on a PC!) 

9. Tetrisphere (you might as well play these games 
on the Game Boy). 

10. Xena: Warrior Princess - no! Hercules - stop It. 
Stop it right now! 

That’s enough (as some bald bloke once said in 
An American Werewolf In London), that’s enough! 

SD Downs, Loughborough University 

PS: You can correct all the spelling mistakes, I 
can’t be arsed. 

You can’t be arsed? Shocking behaviour for a 
student. "When ah were at university, waffle bore 
drone.” And as for ’some bald bloke’? That’s Brian 
Glover youYe talking about! The man’s a bald 
northern hero! “This is rumour control.” “Them 
two? In my flat? Gnrr!” “Tetley mek’ teabags mek’ 
tea.” Oh, hang on, he’s dead. 

Snowboard Shortcuts 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

On Snowboard Kids, the race called Dizzy Land, you 
said there were no shortcuts. But I know one - it’s 
on the left after the T-Rex In the dinosaur place. 
There is also a third shortcut on Night Highway, on 
the jump that takes you to the tight path. On the 
jump, turn your snowboard to the right. 

Linda Blackwell-daCosta, email 

PS: I think you should make another copy of issue 
four of your magazine. 




ASK W ANDY 

r. 

If you have questions, our 
editor has answers. Sometimes 
they’re even correct. 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

I was just wondering if there was any official 
Nintendo thingy that I could get to allow me to 
attach a SCART lead to my N64? If so, where can I 
get one? 

Peter Blair, email 

Nintendo don’t produce a SCART lead (for some 
reason, they want you to use the crappy RF 
output), but companies like Fire International 
produce their own perfectly good leads. You 
should be able to find them in decent game 
stores, or from Fire on (01302) 325225. 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

The screenshots in your import review of 1080** 
Snowboarding showed option screens in English. 
Please could you tell me if these shots are from 
the japanese version or is it American? 

Max Harvey, email 

The 1080® shots came from the Japanese game - 
it has an option that lets you choose either 
English or Japanese text throughout the game. 


this very issue. Rare sent all our Banjo-Kazooie 
artwork to them by mistake). But being mistaken for 
Total 64? We’re kind of offended by that. 

Second Time Lucky 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

Your mag is so great it makes me look bad. I think 
it’s pitiful how crap your mag makes the others look. 
Here’s how I rate your mag -100%. 

Liam Wisker, Cambridge 


A Student Disses Glover 

Dear 64 Magazine, 

Here is my dream list of titles that I would really like 
to own: 

1. Blade Runner 64 (could happen). 

2. Tomorrow Never Dies (wish this would happen). 

3. Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (please let It be a 
^ decent game). 

4. Fi 2000 (made this one up, just want a decent 
Formula 1 game). 

5. A decent aeroplane shoot-’em-up type thing, like 
Top Gun 64, Eurofighter 64, Stealth 64 etc etc. 

6. Point & Click 64 (a Nintendo equivalent of Broken 
Sword or Monkey Island). 

7. Resident Evil 2 (64, obviously). 

8. R-Type 64 (oh yeah. It could happen, those good 
old Spectrum days...) 

9. ISS World Cup *98. 

10 .1 was going to put Mario 2, but then I changed 
my mind and went for Command & Conquer. 


For missing the shortcuts, Russell’s been strapped 
to a chair and forced to listen to the music from 
Banjo-Kazooie*s Rusty Bucket Bay on an endless 
loop. As for issue four, dear god, once was enough! 
You can still get it as a back issue - g’wan, g’wan, 
g’wan, g’wan, g’wan, turn to page 90 and get your 
chequebook ready.

Liam Wisker, Cambridge 

We can understand being mistaken for N64 
Magazine, since it’s only one letter different (in fact. 


That’s more like it. Too bad your fiendish plan to 
flatter all the N64 mags simultaneously has been 
exposed, eh? 


Dear 64 Magazine, 

I think your magazine is crap. Your reviews are 
terrible, your tips are useless and your features are 1 
cack. You give every game high marks no matter how 
pathetic they are. If you don’t print this letter I’ll 
take it that you only print the ones that suck up to 
you. So print it or else! 

Richard Carragher, Newry 

Dear Richard Carragher, we think you are crap. Your 
haircut is terrible, your deodorant is useless and 
your features are cack. You wear every piece of 
clothing your mum buys you no matter how girly 
they are. But we did print your letter, so you must 
be happy now.

deadline pressures meant we 
couldn’t give it as much attention as 
we would have liked. (Which was a lot 
of attention.) 

Well, now we can. 

We predict that Perfect Dark is 
going to be even better than 
Goldeneye. Since we at 64 Magazine 
are firmly of the opinion that

The Datadyne building, an 

ARCHITECTURALLY EEASIBLE STRUCTURE. 


N64, that’s quite a prediction to make. 
But somehow, we don’t think we’ll be 
making arses of ourselves... 

Perfect Dark's heroine is joanna 
Dark, top secret agent of 2023AD. 
Droolers who are looking forward to 
staring at a top-heavy Nintendo 
version of Lara Croft had better put 
their tongues back in, since Joanna is 
not only realistically proportioned, but 
decked out in combat gear to boot. 
Leer at her and she’ll shoot you! 

joanna has been assigned to 
uncover a conspiracy orchestrated by 
the Datadyne corporation - a 
conspiracy which, in proper X Fites 
fashion, threatens to engulf the entire 
world. Datadyne is in the process of 
retrieving a crashed alien spacecraft 
from deep beneath the ocean - you

METAL SURFACES. 


Datadyne is probably not going to 
hand out alien technology freely for 
the benefit of all mankind... 

Why is Perfect Dark going to be so 
cool? Put it this way - the team that 
created Goldeneye are also creating 
Perfect Dark. They’ve improved the 3*D 
game engine so that it’s faster and 
smoother. They’ve devised ways to 
include more special effects. They’ve 
got more futuristic weapons than 
Judge Dredd, including heat-seekers 
and guns that lock onto targets and 


track them even as Joanna runs 
around. The enemies are a lot smarter. 
In short, they’re going to put in all the 
stuff they wanted to do for Goldeneye 
but couldn’t. And yes, there will also 
be a deathmatch game. 

Now Rare have announced that the 
game is due to be released next year, 
they are retreating behind their usual 
Area si-level security, saying only 
that they will reveal more about 
Perfect Dark “nearer the time.” Let’s 
start the countdown... 


If Joanna needs to get somewhere in a hurry, she can hop on a hoveriike. Some areas are 

STILL INACCESSliLE UNLESS SHE GOES ON FOOT. THOUGH. 


Like Goldemeyi, Pekeect Dauk features cutscenes that follow the storyline as it

Name 


fourth most famous Indian (after Hi 
Sitting Bull, Geronimo and the blokfl 
from Voyager). The enemies now 
react according to where Turok 
shoots them - just nicking their arm 
is unlikely to put them off their 
murderous rampage, but putting a 
magnum bullet right into an eye 
socket will result in an instant 
explosion of brain matter! 

Turok’s mission begins in a small 
town that has been attacked by the 
minions of alien overlord Primagen - 
as well as destroying the invaders, 
Turok also has to locate the town’s 
children, who have gone into hiding, 
and get them to safety before the 
aliens find them. As he gets nearer to 
Primagen’s base, Turok must battle 
through subterranean caverns, a 
crashed alien spacecraft and 
eventually a truly grotesque spawning 
ground, where the very walls are alive 
and pumping out new monsters by 
the dozen. 


Typical, isn’t it? You’ve got a great- 
looking game like Turok 2 on the way, 
with some amazing visuals, immense 
kick-ass weapons, hideous monsters 
and enough gore to paint a small 
town red, and what screenshots do 
you get sent? Architecture. Bloody 
architecture. And not bloody in a 
descriptive way either, just a bunch of 
walls and buildings. Which would be 
all very well if we had Richard Rogers 
as a staff writer, but we don’t.

seml-reallstic rally game, Top Gear 
Overdrive is an arcade racer in the 
mould of San Francisco Rush. 

If you’ve ever envied James Bond’s 
gadget-laden cars, then Top Gear 
Overdrive should be right up your 
one-way street. Powers-ups can be 
collected during a race and used to 
confound your opponents. Oil slicks 
can be dumped on the track, nitrous 
oxide canisters used to boost your 
speed, and you can even employ a 
Knight /?/der-style turbo boost to 
jump over obstacles! 


The latest game in Kemco’s long- 
running Top Gear series is rather 
different from its immediate 
predecessor. Top Gear Rally - for a 
start, it's being developed by a 
different company, Snowblind rather 
than Boss Game Studios. The 
differences show up in the game’s 
style of play - instead of being a

The two-player game still has plenty

Top Gear Overdrive will feature 
seven tracks with eight cars (plus a 
bunch of secret vehicles), and also

guarantee that good sportsmanship is 
nothing but a distant memory! 


The four-player mode sacrifices some detail, rut still keeps

lOiofiOBaso 


Game 


Name 


popular in Japan and allows players 
to create and customise their own 
vehicles before racing them. When 
you beat an opponent, they are 
forced to give up their car parts 
allowing you to build other, better 
vehicles. Special custom parts which 
can only be obtained under certain 
conditions encourage players to go 
back and keep on searching for the 
bits they need to build that perfect 
little car. 

While the idea of building and 
tuning cars before racing them may 
not appeal to everyone, the hugely 


READY 


successful Gran Turismo on the 
PlayStation has shown that a great 
many people enjoy doing just that. 

Unlike Gran Turismo though, where 
the emphasis is on simulation and 
realism. Penny Racers places the 
emphasis squarely on fun. The game 
plays a lot like Mario Kart, with cars 
drifting across roads and sliding on 
corners, and takes this kind of ‘toy 
car’ behaviour a step further, with the 
cars doing rolls and somersaults as 
part of their regular manoeuvres. 

Up to four players can build cars 
and race simultaneously across the 
numerous tracks, and for more variety, 
players can build their own devious 
tracks to confound and confuse their 
friends! These tracks and custom cars 
are stored on a Controller Pak, 
allowing N64 owners to trade tracks 
and vehicles just like they would real 
toy ones. 

Penny Racers looks like being a 
great game if it lives up to 
expectations. The prospect of custom 
cars and tracks means that it could 
even present a challenge to the likes 
of Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing. 


After a disastrous foray into

FOR IIFE 


Originally touted as Vivid Racing 
or VR3000, depending on who you 
speak to. Ubi Soft’s forthcoming 
futuristic racing game has finally 
settled on a permanent title, SCARS, 
which stands for ’Super Computer 
Animal Racing Simulation*. Uh-huh. 


The premise behind this rather 
bizarre and somewhat lengthy name 
is that for reasons as yet unexplained, 
a bunch of futuristic supercomputers 


missions - having your wings loaded 
up with laser-guided bombs isn’t 
going to be much help if you run into 
a flight of enemy MiGs! 

Harrier 2000 takes pilots in pursuit 
of a deadly international terrorist 
group called the Brotherhood, which 
has obtained a massive stockpile of 
high-tech weapons which they intend 
to sell to the highest bidder. To give 
potential buyers a chance to see their 
hardware in action, the Brotherhood

has invaded the island of Vahita to 
test out its array of weapons. With 
the population of the island held 
hostage, an all-out ground assault 
has been deemed too risky by the 
UN. so instead a small force of 
Harriers has been despatched to 
carry out precision raids on 
Brotherhood facilities. 

The Harrier has plenty of weapons 
available - five different air-to-air 
missiles, nine air-to-ground missiles, 
six types of rocket and no fewer than 
17 different sorts of bomb! All of these 
will be needed to take down the 
Brotherhood, since they have stolen 
the best weapons the world has 
developed and are more than happy 
to demonstrate them. 

Players can choose between a 
strategic game, where each mission 
has to be carefully planned to 
maximise its chances of success, or a 


more action-oriented approach that 
lets Harrier pilots take off and start 
shooting. Harrier 200&S visuals 
already look impressive, even though 
the game is only 30 percent finished, 
and If it has the depth of Pilotwings 
combined with cannon-blasting 
action, wannabe pilots should be 
prepared for an exciting take off!

SCARS promises multiple tracks, a

adversaries and intelligent light

president Yves Guillemot. SCARS will 
supply “a graphic level that players 
have never seen,” which, as anyone 
who has seen Acclaim’s A//-Sfor

a difficult boast to live up to! 

SCARS so far looks extremely

STAR WARS 

ROGUE 

SQUADRON 






We go BEHIND the scenes 
of LucasArts* new Star Wars 
game, Rogue Squadronl 


With interest in Star Wars 
as high as ever, and rising as 
the next film in the series 
approaches completion for its launch 
next year, it was inevitable that a Jedi- 
related game would appear. Revealed 
at E3 (see last issue). Star Wars: 
Rogue Squadron is that very game! 

While its N64 predecessor. 
Shadows Of The Empire, was 
something of a smorgasbord of game 
types. Rogue Squadron concentrates 
on spacecraft combat, and judging 
from the demo at E3 is all the better 
for it. The player gets to wear the 
orange jumpsuit of none other than 
Luke Skywalker, founder of the Rebel 
Alliance’s elite Rogue Squadron, 
which is led by Star Wars regular 
Wedge Antilles. The team are 
assigned a series of missions on 
different planets throughout the 
Imperium. ranging from the familiar 
environs of Tatooine to mentioned- 








Tatooini is one of the many planets visited. Keep an eye open 

FOR SANDCRAWLERS, SARLACC PITS AND RANTNAS! 


Shadows had a very ambitious. 
Smmr multi-game concept. How will 
Rogue compare? You’ve talked about 
Rogue being more ambitious in some 
ways, can you give examples? 


Mark Haigh-Hutchinson: Obviously 
we learnt a great deal about the N64 
In developing Shadows, although for 
the most part this is a new team and 
Rogue Squadron is their first 
experiences of working on the 
machine. However, we have been 
able to push the graphical 
performance significantly compared 
to Shadows, such that we can 
display very detailed and realistic 
landscapes at a much smoother

but-never-seen worlds like Kessel, to 
make sure that the Empire doesn’t 
strike back. 

Mark Haigh-Hutchinson is the 
Project Leader on Rogue Squadron, 
which was a role he shared on 
Shadows Of The Empire. He has been 
involved in the games industry 
professionally for 14 years, and has 
contributed to over 33 games. 64 
Magazine’s Stuart Wynne spoke to him 
about the new game, as well as some 
of his old ones... 

Shadows Of The Empire was 
imor one of the very first N64 games 
to be written. How much more 
advanced is your understanding of 
the machine now, and what will that 
mean in terms of graphic 
performance and so on for Rogue 
Squadron vs Shadows?

frame rate. Additionally we are able 
to include dramatic real-time lighting 
effects, shadows of objects 
conforming to the landscape, 
interactive musical themes and 
surround-sound encoded sound FX, 
and so on.

Stcir Wars: 
Episode i 

With security clamped tighter 
than a trout’s back passage, the new 
Star Wars film is now complete - 
well, apart from a year’s worth of 
post-production. Little things like 
special effects, stuff like that. But 
what’s it all about? 

The official Lucasfilm Star Wars 




remarkably uninformative. Liam 
Neeson tops the cast list as ‘A 
Venerable Jedi Knight’ - his friends 
probably just call him ‘Venno’ - and 
Natalie Portman is, equally 
helpfully, ‘A Young Queen’. Details 
of the plot or shots of the effects? 
Forget it. Lucasfilm won’t even say 
what the film’s full title is yet! If not 
even the mighty Ain’t It Cool News 
(www.aint-it-cool-news.com) can 
find out, it looks like we’ll have to 
wait for the first trailer to appear in

So, what does anyone know? 
Ewan McGregor is the young Obi- 
Wan Kenobi, Yoda returns, part of 
the film takes place on Coruscant, 
capital of the Republic (the place at 
the end of Jedi: Special Edition 
where everyone went “Where’s 
that, then?”), R2-D2 will show up, 
and Samuel L Jackson presumably 
won’t be discussing 
wampaburgers. Oh, c 
Blessed’s in it as well. 
“Goooordon’s aliiiiiiive!’’ 

Star Wars: Episode 1 should be 
- hell, is - the most eagerly- 
anticipated film of all time. 
Everyone in the office {Star Wars 
bores to a man) hopes it lives up 
to expectations... 


MHH: Rogue Squadron is ambitious in 
different ways to Shadows. As you 
correctly point out. Rogue Squadron is 
more focused than Shadows. 

However, we are striving to provide 
the same visceral excitement as the 
Battle of Hoth from Shadows but over 
large, varied, realistic worlds - with 
complete freedom of motion for the 
player. Additionally, we are using 
many more effects on Rogue 
Squadron such as real-time dynamic 
lighting, interactive musical themes 
varying according to the state of the 
game, more detailed ships, surround 
sound for sound FX, realistic shadows, 
and so on. 


/l/# factor 5 purely doing the 
a£r music? Can you explain how 
they became involved? 


MHH: LucasArts has worked with 
Factor 5 on a number of previous titles 
(for example. Ball Blazer Champions 
for the PlayStation) and has a good 
working relationship with them. 

Rogue Squadron seemed to be a 
perfect match for the two companies, 
with Factor 5’s strong console 
background combined with LucasArts’ 
artistic and game experience. Factor 5 
is supplying most (but not all) of the 
programming and tools, some of the 
artwork, and all of the music and 
sound FX. LucasArts has provided the 
game design, artists, level designers, 
some programming and tools as well 
as quality assurance. In addition, 
LucasArts has also provided voice and 
sound FX data. 


^ > How will Rogue Squadron 
compare to the X’Wing Vs TIE 
Fighter series on the PC? 


MHH: Rogue Squadron is really a very 
different kind of game than X-Wing Vs 
TIE Fighter. Those games are flight 
simulators, whereas Rogue Squadron 
is very much a mission-based arcade 
action experience. The intention is 
that Rogue Squadron provides an 
easy to control, immersive flight 
action game combined with mission- 
based objectives. 

How will the balance be set 
SmT between flight sim and 
arcade? Will loop-the-loops be 
possible? How constrained will 
movement be in the game? 

MHH: The player has complete 
freedom of motion within the game, 
subject to the size of the world. 
These worlds are far bigger than the 
first level of Shadows, for example. If 
the craft allows It (since each has its 
own characteristics) the player can 
easily perform barrel rolls, loop-the- 
loops, and any other acrobatic feat 
they care to try. Initially each mission 
has an assigned craft with which the 
level Is played, but as the player 
progresses through the game they 
are able to unlock new ships which 
can then be used to replay earlier 
missions for a completely new 
experience. The player is provided 


perspectives from which to view the 
game. Including inside a 3-D cockpit, 
external to the craft, drop cameras, 
and more. 

/jyi There’s been talk of interaction 
iSr with wingmen. How involved 
will this be? 

MHH: The full extent of the Interaction 
has not been decided at this point. 

How many people are there In 
the project? Can you give any 
background on them? 

MHH: Although the team size 
fluctuates, there are currently about 28 
people working on the game. The team 
includes a wide variety of very talented 
people, some of whom have lengthy 
careers in the games industry. Factor 5. 
for example, has been programming 
games for about ten years. 

When did project development 
a£r on Rogue Squadron start? How 
long do you expect it to continue? 

MHH: Development has been 
progressing since the spring of 1997 
and the game will ship before 
Christmas of 1998.

Mario and Nintendo’s top game 
designer) reputedly had some 
involvement with Shadows. Has he

MHH: We were fortunate enough to 
have Mr Miyamoto work a little with 
us on Shadows, but so far he has not 
been involved with Rogue Squadron. 


Has the work begun on an 
official tie-in for the new Star 


Wars movie? 


Tom Sarris (PR): Yes, there are 
several new titles currently in 
development that are directly related 
to Star Wars: Episode One. The new 
games will be announced at the E3 
show in 1999. 


In retrospect, how do you feel 
iSr about all the criticism of 
Shadows Of The Empire? 


MHH: Most of the criticism around 
Shadows seemed to be directed at its 
broad scope. This was an intentional 
decision in that the game was not 
aimed specifically at hardcore 
gamers, but rather at people new to 
3-D games. Given the tremendous 
time pressures involved in its 
production (as well as working on a 
machine that did not exist for Its first 
nine months of development). 
Shadows succeeded in delivering a 
varied game experience to a wide 
audience. However, in retrospect. It 
could have benefited from further 
time to fine-tune the gameplay to a 
greater degree. 


How accurate will the 
spaceships be in the game 
compared to ‘real* movie models? Will 
movie renders be available to use? 
How many types of ship will there be 
in the game? 


Fighters, AT-ATs, AT*STs, Probe Droids, 
and so on. Additionally there will also 
be several secret craft for the 
gamesplayer to discover... 


MHH: I think people will very much 
appreciate the attention to detail in 
this game. All the craft models are 
very close to the original sources, and 
in fact, are much more detailed than 
those in Shadows. The quality of 
texturing is also much improved, and 
the real time lighting effects as well as 

_ pre-lighting add up to a very 

realistic result. There will be 
five main ships for the player to 
fly, along with a whole host of 
familiar and new enemies to 
< encounter

-Kazooie 


© Japan's been having a hard 

time of late. Financial crises, 
massive foreign debts, 
bankers topping themselves, the 
works. As if all that were not enough, 
now there’s a new casualty. Mario’s 
been made redundant. 

Yes, I’m afraid it’s true. The portly 
plumber has munched his last magic 
mushroom. P45 in hand, he’s off down 
the Job Centre to sign for his Giro and, 
if he’s lucky, get himself a part in The 
Fuller Monty. No more chaste flirting 
with the Princess, no more rowdy 
nights on the town with Luigi and 
Yoshi. Just daytime TV, boil-in-the*bag 
and endless scouring of the ‘Sits Vac’ 
bit of the local free rag. 

Who has done this? Which 
heartless swines have kicked 
Nintendo’s mascot out on his ear? 
Here’s a hint - they’re British, they 
wrote the best game on the N64 and 
they’re called Rare. Damn, that last 
one was a bit of a giveaway...

Bear Necessities 

When BanjO'Kazooie first appeared in 
public at the 1997 E3 show, reactions 
were positive but also tinged with 
cynicism - didn’t it look an awful lot 
like Mario 64 with better visuals? Rare 
obviously disagreed; when your editor 
rang up Rare a couple of months prior 
to the 1998 E3 show to ask about 
Banjo, he was immediately greeted 
with the reply, **Oh yeah, you’re the

that made the Shigeru Miyamoto 
game work so well in the first place - 
and then does them all better. 

There’s a certain irony in that - 
after all, it wasn't all that long ago 
that Japanese companies had the 
reputation for taking an existing 
product, fixing the bugs and 
improving on the original so much 
that the new product became the 
definitive item. Now, it’s happened the 
other way around. After playing 
Banjo-Kazooie, going back to Mario is 
like trading down from a Bentley to a 
Fiesta Popular Plus. They both do the 
same job, it’s just that one of them is 
so much more refined. 


one who said that Banjo-Kazooie 
was just a Mario clone." Memories 
like elephants, damn them. 

One thing you’re not going to see in 
this review is any wholesale word- 
eating. The inescapable fact is that 
Banjo-Kazooie (along with dozens of 
other games) owes an enormous 
debt to Mario 64 for its creation of a 
new game style, and any game that 
takes a similar approach - a 3-D 
world with platforms and puzzles - is 
going to be compared to the N64’s 
debut title. What sets Banjo-Kazooie 
apart from the Crocs, Gexes and 
Bomberman Heroes of this world is 
that Banjo-Kazooie takes everything

Banjo-Kazooie has a plot, of sorts - 
it*s hardly Tom Clancey, but it’s still 
more than Mario's ‘rescue the 
Princess’ postage stamp job. Evil 
witch Gruntilda has kidnapped young 
Tooty the bear. Intending to do a 
remake of The Fly by stealing Tooty’s 
beauty (en routey) and lumping the 
unlucky ursine with all her general 


Kazooie move away from "Mario with 
better graphics* to "Mario beater’. The 
first time you play the game, you have 
no choice but to explore a small 
grassy area patrolled by Bottles the 
mole, who gives you the basic moves 
you need. When you first enter the

mankiness In return. When you lose 
the game, you actually get to see this 
transformation take place - y’know, 
green skin and fangs aside, the new- 
look Gruntilda ain’t at all bad for 
someone who isn’t even real. 

Naturally In true heroic style. Banjo 
the rednecked bear, is definitely not 
going to take the snatching of his 
sister lying down (there’s doubtlessly 
a dodgy joke about the ‘closeness* of 
redneck families in there somewhere, 
but we’ll save that for another day), 
so he courageously leaps to the 
rescue. Along for the ride is Kazooie, 
a sarcastic bird of some description 
(a ‘breeguir, whatever the hell that 
is) who normally lives in Banjo’s 
rucksack but can pop out whenever 
she’s needed. 

This combination of two characters 
in one is part of what helps Banjo- 


game proper. Banjo has a couple of 
attacks and a high jump, but little 
else. However, the further you go, the 
more moves the pair acquire. Each 
time you find a molehill. Bottles pops 
up to teach Banjo or Kazooie a new 
move - which, as luck would have it, is 
needed to progress further within that

world. The first time around, it took 
over nine hours of play before Banjo 
and Kazooie were fully kitted out with 
all their moves. Oddly enough, by the 
time the twosome are fully tooled up, 
it’s Kazooie who proves the more 
capable of the duo. Maybe the game 
should have been called 
Kazooie-Banjo. On second 
thoughts, perhaps not. That’s 
a stupid name.

jigsaw puzzle pieces hidden 
throughout the game and using them 
to complete the various pictures 
hanging on the walls of Gruntilda’s 
lair. Mario fans who try jumping into 
the pictures will be disappointed, 
since the actual entrances can be 
quite a long way from the puzzles that 
open them.

Top Of The World, Ma 

The only way to reach the top of the 
termite mound is to get Mumbo to turn you 
into a termite! Once you've made your way 
up the spiralling platforms inside, you 
emerge to find an extra life and a puzzle 
piece at the summit. 


Call Rentokill! 

Giant termites patrol the area around their 
mound, demanding access to Banjo's 
shorts (we're not kidding). They succumb to 
a couple of punches, or a swift forward roll. 


“Talk to me here and 
you’ll gain the Talon Trot 
move. This lets you climb onto 
the stone circle to collect the 
notes and the Jinjo, and more 
importantly you can now climb 
steep slopes. This way, you can 
collect all the notes on the hills, 
and when you exit the level you 
can now reach the next world!” 


Someone Got 
Laid Here 

Hiding under a stone slab are several 
eggs - you can never have too many! 


fTcRMiTE Top 


Gorillagram! 

Once you've learned how to fire the eggs, 
stand on the platform across from Conga's 
tree and blast him with eggs! Make sure 
you don't get hit by his oranges, and after 
he takes a few hits he'll surrender and give 
you the puzzle piece. 


'Do The Conga 


Chimpy’s 

Conner 


Orange Crush 

Conga the gorilla doesn't like intruders, 
and bombards them with oranges. 
However, you can use this to your 
advantage • stand on each of the orange 
squares in turn, then run away just before 
an orange hits you. When Conga hits all 
three boxes, he'll accidentally unlock a 
puzzle piece. 


Oranges Are 
^ NotThe Only Fruit 

Climb Conga's tree, blag the orange and 
take it to Chimpy the cheeky monkey. In 
gratitude, hell raise a tree stump, allowing 
you to reach the ledge above, and also give 
you a puzzle piece. 


Go To Work ^ 
On An Egg 

There is a stash of eggs on this ledge - 
once you talk to Bottles, you'll be able to 
put them to destructive use! 


Witch Switch ^ 

Jump on this Gruntilda switch and a ^ 
puzzle piece will appear in her lair for 
you to collect. Each world has one switch 
hidden within.

collect, you get an 
extra segment on 
your energy bar. 

One is above the Juju in Mumbo’s village, 
and the second is in a small cave in a cliff 
above the lake - either jump over the fence 
and slide down, or change into the termite 
and scurry across the slope. 


That Juju That You Do 

This pile of stones is the Juju - fire an egg 
into the mouth of each block in turn to 
make it disappear. When ail the blocks 
have gone, a puzzle piece will appear. 


HitThe Hut 

JMumbo's village has six wooden huts. 

Once you’ve spoken to Bottles and picked 
up the Beak Buster move, you can 
demolish them and plunder their contents! 
The first hut you wreck contains five notes, 
the second five eggs, the third an enemy 
(watch out!) the fourth the green Jinjo, the 
fifth an extra life and the last the all- 
important puzzle piece. J 


Mumbo’s home (well, homes - he’s got 
several dotted around the place) is this big 
orange skull. Once you’ve collected enough 
skulls- five in this case - Mumbo can work 
his magic and turn you into something 
else! Make sure you collect the notes 
inside the skull as well. i 


Smash Shed Six 


Bottles 

Soys... 


Hives Of 
Activity 

If you’re short of energy, you 
can smash open one of the 
two beehives on this level 
and regain three units of 
energy. Later in the game, 
the bees in the hives take 
exception to this and chase 
after you! 


‘‘Wotcha! Gab with me 
in Mumbo’s village and I’ll show 
Kazooie the Beak Buster move, 
which lets you power-slam into 
the ground to break open 
objects, activate switches - and 
kill enemies!” 


Leoge-endary 


Purple Pain 

Strange purple goons wander around near 
the start, charging at Banjo if they see him. 
Just mow them down for a useful source of 
energy If you need It. 


JiNJOISM ▼ 

There are five Jinjos in 
each wodd - when you 
find the last one, 
he/she/it rewards you 
with a puzzle piece. Four 
are visible on the map. 
k and the fifth is trapped 
\ inside a hut in 

Mumbo’s village. i 


Give Me Some Skull 

Mumbo’s Mountain contains five of 
Mumbo’s crystal skulls, which he needs to 
perform his magic. Four are out in the open, 
and the fifth is inside the termite mound. 


This furious Brahma bull can’t be 
killed - the best you can do is to 
stun him. It’s safest to give him a 
very wide berth! 


Bottles 

Says... 


Welcome! 

This teleporter is the entrance to the 
level - to leave, just step on it again. 


“Have a chat with me 
after nicking Conga’s orange 
and you can learn the mysteries 
of the egg - I’ll show Kazooie

Initially, only one world - Mumbo’s 
Mountain - can be explored, the single 
jigsaw piece needed to open it handily 
being in the same area as the picture. 
Everything else is tantalisingly out of 
reach, up a steep path that the 
lumbering Banjo isn't able to climb. 

Mumbo's Mountain is a kind of 
microcosm of the game as a whole, 
offering players the chance to hone 
their skills and get to grips with the 
kind of obstacles that crop up 
throughout Banjo and Kazooie's 
quest. There's a small lake to practice 
swimming in, platforms to leap from, 
puzzles to solve and enemies to 
smash to pieces. 

Also popping up for the first time is 
Mumbo the witch doctor, quite an

WORLDS THAT CATER FOR THE 

TASTES OF ALL VISITORS, AND 

HOPE WE CAN SEE YOU IN ONE OF 

THEM soon! 

NB: Travel insurance is 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 


World one: 








When visiting scenic Mumbo's 
Mountain, be sure to drop by the 
rustic native village. Wanton 
vandalism may not be 
appreciated by the locals, so be 
prepared to defend yourself. 
Citrophobes should be advised 
that there Is a danger of heavy 
falls of oranges in the south-west. 
There is also a major termite 
problem in certain regions, so be 
sure to bring plenty of bug spray.

level. On Mumbo's Mountain, the pair 
are transformed into a termite, which 
can cling to the perilously steep 
surfaces inside a huge termite mound 
near Mumbo's hut. While the ultimate 
reward here seems to be just a puzzle 
piece and an extra life, don't be so 
sure - Mumbo's magic extends further 
than just his mountain... 

Each world holds ten puzzle pieces, 
100 musical notes (which when 
collected in sufficient quantities let 
you open sealed areas) and varying 
numbers of eggs (for shooting), red 
and gold feathers (for flying and 
invincibility), honeycombs (for energy) 
and Mumbo's magical crystal skulls. 
There are also five jinjos in each 
world, that are little multicoloured 
creatures with long noses who award 
you a puzzle piece when you've got 
the entire polychromal set. 

Mr Noseybonk 

Collecting the puzzle pieces isn't as 
simple as It sounds. Although some 
are visible from the off, the only 
brain-teaser being exactly how to 
reach them, most of them are 
hidden and require you either to 


A CONVERSATION tETWEEN A CAMEL AND A PALM TREE - IT COULD ONLY 
HAPPEN IN A Nintendo game. Or a David Lynch film. 


solve a puzzle or complete some task 
to make them appear. 

The further you go Into the game, 
the more demanding the puzzles, 
which stands to reason really. It'd be 
rather pointless to have things get 
easier the nearer the end you were. 
Like Mortal Kombat Mythologies, for 
instance. Early puzzles include 
spelling out the name 'Banjo- 
Kazooie' on a tiled floor (after first 
figuring out how to drain the room of 
water) which is straightforward 
enough, but later ones involve 
tapping out a tune on a giant church 
organ and making life comfortable 
for a huge mechanical shark! 


For those who prefer action to 
thinking. Banjo Kazooie doesn't 
skimp in this respect either. As well as 
dealing with the small-fry enemies 
infesting each world, who can be 
clawed, rolled or pecked into oblivion, 
there are larger bad guys who have to 
be nailed in their own individual ways. 

Nipper the giant crab, a resident of 
Treasure Trove Cove, seems at first to 
be Invulnerable, responding to 
Kazooie's insults with swipes from his 
massive pincers. Eggs don't harm him 
and his crustaceous body is 
impervious to anything Banjo has to 
offer, so how is he defeated? There's 
probably some smart way to do it

involving precision timing and darting 
between his claws to chin him, but the 
easiest approach is to wait until 
you've got Kazooie's ‘wonderwings' 
ability later in the game, then come 
back and deck him while you're 
invincible. The brute force approach - 
works every time!

events take place within the game 
worlds, so it*s possible for smart 
players to check out the lie of the land 
in advance before committing 
themselves to a contest.

Of course, all of this kind of thing has 
been seen before, in Super Mario 64, 
which offered a similar 'worlds within 
worlds’ approach, and in fact had 
more levels squeezed Into a cartridge

(there’s barely a square inch of Banjo 
Kazooie that doesn’t have some well- 
designed texture slapped on it), the 
further you go Into the game, the 
better it looks. Clanker’s Cavern is a 
masterpiece of atmosphere, a 
polluted cylinder of rusty metal and 
garbage that somehow never looks 
quite as gross as you’d imagine. Its 
centrepiece is Clanker himself, a

bizarrely often makes it look more 
realistic than some games that strive 
for a believable look. The only other 
N64 game that comes close to 
matching BanjO'Kazooie*s glowing 
look of solidity is Forsaken, and while 
Acclaim’s title has more impressive 
lighting effects, ultimately its hi-tech 
tunnels have a lot less variety. 

Musical Spoof 

The music within the levels also varies, 
not just from world to world, but from 
section to section, smoothly segueing 
from one style to another as Banjo and 
Kazooie move around. An early case is 
in Treasure Trove Cove, where the 
music goes from jaunty Caribbean 
steel drums to a sea shanty as you get 
nearer to a pirate ship, but there are 
plenty of other examples. 

As Banjo and Kazooie wander 
around Gruntilda’s Lair, which is 
effectively a hub level that allows 
access to all the others, the standard 
music is a mutant version of Teddy 
Bears* Picnic, just far enough 
removed from the original to avoid any 
annoying legal problems. Approach 
the entrance of Gobi’s Valley and the 
musicians start to walk like Egyptians; 
head across the graveyard to Mad 
Monster Mansion and you get a 
mournful organ rendition straight out 
of Dracula’s castle. The character

Sound effects are also well done. 
Even though Banjo and Kazooie’s little 
yelps and squeaks do start to wear 
thin after a while, they never quite go 
so far as to become annoying. The 
‘speech’ of the numerous characters is 
put across with appropriate burbling 
noises as the text of their 
conversations appears in bubbles on 
screen; Banjo has a gormless yokel 
drawl, Kazooie a dry parroty squawk. 
Bottles the mole a muffled Kenny- 
style mumble and Gruntilda a 
demented cackle. Even bit-part 
players like feathers and glass 
tumblers (I kid you not) get their own 
distinctive little wibbles. 

As well as the spot effects, there is 
also great use of atmospheric 
background noise. Clanker’s Cavern

his bonds, Bubblegloop Swamp has

sonic subtlety, the higher you climb 
above Treasure Trove Cove, the quieter 
the music gets, until at the top of the 
island’s lighthouse all you can hear is 
the wind blowing across the 
mountain. Sheer class.

World six: 


Jump Around 

In play, Banjo-Kazooie is very much of 
the Mario 64 school, though 
tightened up a great deal. Making the 
most difference is the vastly better 
camera control. Even though the basic 
functions are the same - rotate 
around Banjo, zoom in, zoom out - it’s 
a lot smarter, most of the time 
avoiding the irritating habits of 3-0 
cameras where they can’t decide 
where to position themselves. 

Annoyingly (and somehow 
Inevitably), the few places where the 
camera really struggles to keep up 
with the action are the ones where 
you’re at risk of losing a life if you 
make a wrong move. One particularly 
irksome section is in the depths of 
Clanker’s Cavern, where air is scarce - 
a friendly fish provides bubbles for 
you, but because there’s a huge block 
at the centre of the deep pool you’re

it, making it impossible for you to find

over a sea of Instantly-lethal lava, 
where just as you start to negotiate a 
twisting path the camera often 
decides to throw an eppy. 

These glitches aside, the camera 
does probably the best job to date in 
any 3-D platformer. Useful tricks 
include a ‘look’ mode where you get 
to see the world through Banjo’s goofy 
eyes, which shows off the impressive 
amount of attention put Into every 
object In the game, and by holding 
down the R button you get a kind of

floating camera, 
making it easier to 
judge jumps, so 
most of the game 
will be spent with the 
shoulder button welded down. 

Each of the levels has had a lot 
of time and effort spent to make 
them challenging without being 
overly frustrating. There’s nothing 
more annoying in a platform game 
than having to make a series of 
precise jumps to reach a certain area.

Visitors are advised to take all 
the necessary precautions before 
entering the hostile environment

monuments, many of which still 
hold buried treasures for those 
brave and skilful enough to enter. 
Flying is the recommended 
means of travelling around the 
valley, but those who wish to get

and hedonistic - she could almost be

Even though the overall theme of 
the game is squarely aimed at kids, 
there*s still the odd bit of good ol*

called Loggo who could have come

lt*s this sort of humour that keeps 
Banjo Kazooie from sinking into the 
kind of sanitised Disneyesque world 
occupied by Mario, where not only do 
bad things never happen, but bad 
thoughts are banned too. If Nintendo 
are Disney, which they would 
undoubtedly like to be, then Rare are 
Warner Bros - on the surface doing 
the same thing, but with just enough 
of an anarchic edge to keep them 
interesting. (Nobody mention Space 
Jam, or the analogy collapses...) 


The Summing Up Bit 

lt*s a pity we didn*t wait until we*d 
seen Banjo-Kazooie before we carried 
out last issue*s updating of the 
Nindex scores. If we had, Mario 64 
would have suffered rather more, 
since in comparison to Banjo-Kazooie 
it looks like Stephenson*s Rocket 
beside a Eurostar. 

It just goes to show what a 
difference two years can make. Mario 
64 was the first game on the N64, and 
at the time people were absolutely 
frothing at the mouth to praise it as 
the greatest videogame ever written. 


Now THAT IS ONE BIG-ASS SNOWMAN! IF 
YOU WANT A SENSE OF SCALE. BaNJO IS 
ABOUT AS TALL AS THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE... 


only to have one slight mistake 
force you back to the start. Banjo- 
Kazooie does have a few sections 
where careful jumps are needed, 
but the game is fairly forgiving of 
mistakes, and thankfully if you do 
screw up it never takes too long 
to get back into position for a 
second try. 


Captain BK 
And His Band 

Banjo-Kazooie is also quite a 
funny game, as in funny ha-ha. 
Much of it is Childrens ITV-level 
stuff, with lots of discussion of 
Gruntilda*s underpants and personal 
hygiene, but the characters 
themselves are more appealing than 
anyone was expecting. Banjo*s a bit of 


World eight: 


Hello, sailor! The dock area is 
not really a tourist attraction, but 
economy travellers or 
shipspotters may wish to visit. 
Recent oil spills have left the 
water highly undesirable for 
swimmers, and local lifebelts do 
not meet current health and 
safety regulations. Despite the 
pollution, you may still see the 
occasional dolphin around the 
bay. Rusty Bucket Bay is a fully 
working port, so try to avoid 
interfering with the stevedores.

Bc^njo-Kdzooie 




Now, it looks positively barren and 
simplistic. Even though Banjo-Kazooie 
is the same type of game, it*s a far 
more immersive experience, and it*s 
not just because the graphics are 
better. Mario*s stark, angular 
landscapes made it obvious that you 
were playing a game, but Banjo- 
Kazooie spares no effort to convince 
you that you're exploring an actual 
world. A strange fantasy world, to be 
sure, but it's got an internal logic that 
was sometimes missing from Mario. 

With Banjo-Kazooie so good, it 
makes you wonder what Rare plan to 
do to make their other cutesy 
adventure. Twelve Tales: Conker 64, 
an improvement. Based on what was 
on show at E3 (see last issue), the 
style of play is very similar, but while 
Banjo and Kazooie overcame the 
preconceptions that were formed 
based on the character designs (“A 
redneck bear? The /le//?"). Conker still 
looks disturbingly twee. And those 
eyes, those mad staring eyes... 


just how much long-term play 
Banjo Kazooie will ultimately offer is 
debatable, if only because it's the sort 
of game that will be played intensively 
from the moment it's taken from the 
box until it's been cracked. Once all 
the puzzle pieces have been found, 
there's not much incentive to go 
through the game and find them all 
again unless you're trying to Improve 
on your completion time. Much of the 
game's challenge comes from trying to 
work out where all the items are and 
how best to reach them, but once you 
know, it's possible to clear out a 
whole world in a matter of minutes. In 
the short term, once you've opened up 


a few levels there are several points 
that offer infinite life loops - go into 
the level, take the shortest route to 
an extra life, leave the level, re-enter 
the level ad infinitum. Since death 
comes fairly infrequently anyway 
once Banjo and Kazooie have got 
their full set of moves, the most 
common cause of the game over 
sequence is the inconvenient human 
need for sleep. 

That shouldn't deter you from 
buying the game. Banjo-Kazooie is 
brilliant, plain and simple, and 
another example of why Nintendo 
have become so dependant on Rare - 
the company produces games that are 
every bit as good as Nintendo's own, if 
not better. And there's no higher 
recommendation than that! ^9

Never mind ‘every bit as

I’d say Rare produces their games to a 

HIGHER standard! ThIS GAME HAS BEEN A 
LONG TIME IN COMING (OR AT LEAST IT 
SEEMS LIKE IT) BUT IT WAS MORE THAN 
WORTH THE WAIT! ThE GAME IS SO BIG 
THAT IT SHOULD KEEP YOU GOING FOR

BEST football 
game ever 
has spawned 
a sequel! 


INTERNATIO 

SUPERSTAR 



Holy scorchio! What a 
complete summer this is. the 
World Cup finals in France, 
and a brand new football game from 
the makers of the best ever football 
game. What self-respecting crazed 
football nut could ask for more (except 
perhaps a couple of petrol bombs, a 
hefty beer intake and a severe lack of 
tickets for any England game)? 


Tnat*s supposed to IE Alan Shearer, is it? How come all the player portraits look like 
Paul Scholes... even the rlack players? Not disrespect to the youngster mind. 


ISS *98 (or in this case Jikkyou 
World Soccer: World Cup France *98, 
but that’s a bit of a mouthful!) follows 
on from the much-played original 
which still holds the record for the 
most popular game in the office. In 
fact, we’ve only just got bored rigid of 
the original ISS 64 - but to be fair, 
that was after a year and a half of 
lunch-time grudge matches. 

So the sequel couldn’t have come 
at a better time, and the fact that this 
is the japanese import version (which 


was miles better than the PAL one the 
first time round) just adds to our joy. 

The first notable aspect of ISS *98 
is the official World Cup licence 
slapped on it (this only applies to the 
japanese version, mind), meaning that 
you’ll be able to savour all the thrills 
and spills of the ’Coup De Monde’, 
albeit in japanese.

a screaming 30-yard rocket, all with 
more aftertouch than ever before. The 
players also respond much better to 
loose ball situations - so if you shoot 
at goal and the ball ricochets off the 
goalie, first time strikes are possible 
without the annoying delay that 
plagued the first game. Stuff like 
scissor kicks, overheads and toe-

applies to headers, which can be 
controlled and directed much easier 
than before. 

Pundits may also notice the 
enhanced speed of the game. This 
isn’t just in the overall pace of the 
games (although they do seem more 
frantic) but in the dead-ball situations. 
The hair-pulling delays for 
substitutions have been completely 
eradicated and the set-piece plays are 
also nippier to get underway. 


Three Lions 

The japs have really gone to town with 
the presentation as well. Whenever a 
foul is committed or a goal scored, a 
replay will instantaneously take place 
on-screen and then shrink into a jazzy 
box and slide off as the real action 
recommences - very Sky Sports! 

What about those magical touches 
of realism then? The sort of stuff you 
look at and think “Blimey, I’ve never 
seen that in a football game before!” 

Well, sadly the 
dog on the pitch 
still isn’t present, 
nor are the 
streakers and 
enraged fans, but 
there’s plenty 
more to savour, 
believe us! 



For a start, if a player gets harshly 
booked by the ref, they will vent their 
frustration at the official and adopt 
the body language of a crazed nutter 
about to chin him, until that is, a team 
mate steps in to push you back. The 
injuries are also a pleasure to watch. 
Although there are no David Buust- 
style bendy-shin compound fractures 
to be seen, if you take a player out 
maliciously, they will hit the deck in a

crumpled heap. You will then 
inevitably receive a booking and the 
physios will rush on and administer 
the magic spray on the felled player. If 
that doesn’t work, the stretcher men 
will dash onto the scene and lug him 
off. Quite marvellous. 

If you fiddle with the foreign-text 
options, there is much to be found. 

For a start you can adjust the camera 
perspective and play the game from 
an entirely different angle, and even 
alter the player attributes to 
transform dodgy strikers into Brazilian 
gods in the blink of an eye. 

As this is the japanese import copy, 
we are treated to the usual 
hyperactive tones of some over- 
enthusiastic commentator. The 
difference with this game though is 
that the ranting studio bod also 
shouts the names of the players (the 
real ones that is - “Shearer! Ronaldo! 
Batistuta!”) and cheesy stuff like 
“nice combination”. We love those

There is very little we can fault this

However, the new height-adjustable 
free kicks take some mastering and 
can be very misleading. You see, 
whenever you get to kick the bladder 
from dead-ball situations, the arrow 
that showed the direction in the 
previous game has now been 
enhanced to give the player freedom 
to adjust the height. In most instances 
it works (goal kicks, corners) but for 
free kicks it is very hard to judge what 
height will sufficiently clear the wall...

not ‘be in* 3-D. and this is an 
important distinction. The characters 
in the game are now rendered in 
impressive three dimensional solidity, 
and the arenas, instead of being flat, 
are also in three dimensions. 

However, the actual ‘3-D* aspect of the 
game is fairly limited. Most of the 
action still takes place in and is 
viewed on a 2-D plain, from the side. 

This means that all the usual moves 
and techniques still apply, since

the cartoon violence for exactly what 
it is, OTT schlock...

outrageous violence a step further, 
with newer, even more violent moves,

Mortal Kombat was a 
revolutionary concept. It 
took the standard beat-*em-up format 
and added something totally new - 
over the top gore! Kids loved it, 
parents hated it. Some people even 
suggested that the violence in the 
game would encourage children to

about pointing your character in the 
right direction, your attention can go 
into working out and accomplishing 
the myriad of special moves. 

Faster Than A 
Speeding Komet! 

One of the most notable things about 
Mortal Kombat 4 is the speed at 
which the game moves. The 
characters bounce and kick their way 
around the screen like a bunch of 
manic sprinters on steroids. And 
rather refreshingly, the control system 
is responsive enough to keep up with 
it. Nothing spoils a game like super¬ 
fast animation coupled with 
unresponsive controls. 


practically all the combat takes place 
in two dimensions. The 3-D movement 
in the game is achieved through the 
use of a sidestep move, similar to that 
used in Fighter*s Destiny and Bio 
Freaks. With this, players can move 
into and out of the screen, then after a 
moment or so the camera will pan 
around so that they are once again on 
a 2-D plain. Other 3-D aspects 
occasionally crop up when certain 
moves are performed, or when 
finishing moves are accomplished. Do 
a throw, for example, and the camera 
will pan around behind or in front of 
the player for a better angle on it. and 
fatality moves are shown from a 
number of different angles, much like 
fight scenes in a Jackie Chan film. 


The overall result is pretty effective. 
The camera angles and sidestep 
moves give a much more 3-D 
experience than previous Mortal 
Kombat games, with the camera 
changes taking place quickly and 
effectively, not disrupting the 
gameplay at all. The fact that the 
gameplay is 2-D most of the time, 
although it may disappoint those who 
were hoping for a totally new 
experience, actually makes it very easy 
to play. As you don’t have to worry

•ICAUSC YOU’RE POPULAR WHEN 
YOU’RE DEAD. IT DOESN’T MEAN YOU’LL 
NECESSARILY RE WELCOMED RACK! 


If you’ve played any of the previous 
Mortal Kombat titles, then you 
should pretty much know what to 
expect from the gameplay. Check 
that, if you’ve played any of the 
previous Mortal Kombat titles apart 
from Mortal Kombat Mythologies: 
Sub Zero, then you should know 
exactly what to expect! If MK 
Mythologies: Sub Zero is your only 
experience so far of the Mortal 
Kombat universe, then let’s just clear 
a few things up right now. Firstly, you 
can play as more than one character. 
Secondly, the gameplay does not 
consist primarily of making pixel- 
perfect jumps through levels of 
precarious platforms only to be 



annihilated by the end-of-level boss 
on stage two. Mortal Kombat 4 is 
nothing at all like that. 

Now that we’ve cleared that up... in 
addition to the inclusion of 3-D. 

Mortal Kombat 4 has one or two other 
new features worthy of mention. The 
first is the fact that each character 
now has their own special weapon. 

Krazy Kombat! 

This weapon should not be confused 
with the usual run-of-the-mill energy 
blasts - in general it takes the form of 
a sword or mace of some sort, which - 
when you work out how to draw it - 
has its own range of special moves. 


Weapons are dropped if the character 
holding them is hit hard enough, and 
can then be picked up by either 
combatant. Which brings us to the 
second new feature, the 'foreign 
object factor’. In the style of American 
professional wrestling, most of the 
arenas contain various items which 
can be utilised in the combat. These 
include rocks, and even the odd skull 
from time to time. 

There’s really little more that needs 
to be said as far as gameplay goes. 
The game includes team fighting, a 
tournament mode, a host of difficulty 
levels and you’ll find that pretty much 
every feature in the game can be

In Konclusion... 

Basically, Mortal Kombat 4 can be 
summed up as follows: more of the 
same, with a few nice extras. The 
speed of the game is nothing short of 
amazing, and really goes a long way 
to raising this title some way above 
the other games of the same genre 
currently available for the N64. If we 
had to pick holes, we might say that 
the ending sequences we’ve seen so 
far are fairly unimpressive, and the 
fact that you seem to get the same 
ending sequence whether you finish 
on the novice or on the ultimate 


difficulty level is a trifle disappointing. 
However, that said, the game plays 
like a dream, and the fatalities are 
gorier than ever, ensuring many happy 
gaming hours to come. As with most 
games of this type. Mortal Kombat 4 
is the most fun when played in two- 
player mode against a friend, but the 
one-player mode is also great fun, 
which is a pleasant surprise. No 
Mortal Kombat fan should be without 
this game!

© Every so often a game 

comes along which is a little 
different from your average 
title. This doesn’t happen very often, 
presumably because it’s far easier to 
produce a game based on a successful 
formula (beat-’em-ups. race games, 
etc) than to go out on a limb with a 
totally new kind of game. Wetrix, 
though, is something different. It’s 
weird, wacky and wet. Think of playing

whole game is pointless - so why is it 
so frustratingly addictive? 

As mentioned already, the basic 
gameplay is fairly easy to pick up. Red 
blocks called ‘uppers* (wow, man!) 
drop from the sky, and you must move 
them around and rotate them before 
they reach the ground where they 
form a raised wall. The object is to use 
these walls to form reservoirs in 
which water is then deposited. The 
catch is that the pieces aren’t always 
the shape you need, and to start with 
you don’t get enough of them to build 
a wall around the whole area. This 
usually means that in your first few 


games you’ll end up with huge holes 
in your barricades, and will watch 
helplessly as the water drains away 
off the edges of the platform. 

As water falls from the platform, it 
slowly fills up a tube at the side of 
the screen. This is your drain. The 
idea is to prevent the drain from 
filling to the top because when it 
does, the game is over. 

Fairly soon, you’ll realise that the 
idea is to start with a small reservoir 
which can hold the initial water drops 
and then enlarge it as you go. The 
problem with this is that not far into 
the game it starts to rain, and all this 
excess water will immediately run off 
the edges of the platform, thus filling 
the drain. It then becomes a race to 
surround the entire platform with 
walls and of course if you manage to 
do this, then inevitably your water 
level will have risen so far that liquid 


will spill over the original walls and 
you’ll need to get to work building 
them higher. 

Wetrix-Wet 
Tricks, Geddit? 

This is pretty much how the rest of the 
game goes. You’ll be constantly trying 
to cover leaks and create new walls. 
Green ‘downers’ (bogus, man!) allow 
you to lower the land, widen lakes or 
connect small reservoirs to make 
bigger ones. If you are fairly 
successful and manage to create 
effective lakes, then you’ll get some 
nice aesthetic effects which mean 
bonus scores. Deep lakes, for 
instance, produce a little duck who 
happily swims around quacking. A 
wide lake, on the other hand, grows 
an attractive rainbow. 

Now you may all be thinking that 
this sounds pretty easy so far. All you 


need to do is raise walls and drop 
water in? No problem! But of course, 
that’s not all there is to it, oh no. The 
first problem that you’ll probably 
encounter will be the bombs. These 
drop down with very little warning and 
blow a huge hole in the land wherever 
they land. If this hole happens to be in

the middle of one of your reservoirs 
then the water will begin to drain out 
extremely quickly. The trick to 
preventing this is to drop the bomb in 
a water-free corner of the map and 
then fill it quickly. Be careful not to 
drop a bomb into a hole already 
present in the map though, or you'll 
experience a *re-bomb’ where 
numerous bombs drop randomly onto 
the map and decimate your carefully 
erected structures. 

In addition to falling bombs you 
also need to contend with ice cubes 
which turn any water they touch to 
ice, making it impossible to redirect 
the water until the ice thaws. The ice 
can be melted using a fireball, but 
these are better dropped into 


impossible! No matter how good you 
are in Classic mode, it'll be a while 
before you can last more than a 
minute or so at Pro level. Time Attack 
mode is fairly self-explanatory - you 
get a limited amount of time to score 
as many points as possible, whilst 
Handicap mode lets you start with 
various different factors like raised 
floors, multiple holes, sheets of ice, 
and the like. 

Let Battle 
Commence! 

No good puzzle game would be 
complete these days without a decent 
head-to-head mode, and Wetrix offers 
just such a mode. Two players are 
able to face off on a vertical split¬ 



IF YOU niE ENOUGH WATER ONTO A 
SHEET OF KE IT WILL STRETCH UPWARDS 
AND EVENTUALLY CRACK, AS HAS 
HAPPENED HERE. 


the other player. The higher up the 
gauge the indicator is, the more 
devastating the attack, with the bomb 
being the most powerful. 


Think of playing Tetris in the bath... 



unfrozen water as they instantly 
evaporate it in a cloud of steam, 
boosting your score and lowering the 
level in your drain. 

As if all this weren't enough, the 
playing area is also geologically 
unstable and if you build your 
structures too high you will trigger 
an earthquake, bringing the 
whole lot tumbling down, if this 
happens when you have got a 
gallons of water contained on 
screen, well... 

In addition to the practice 
mode, Wetrix has a number 
of other gameplay choices. 

I Classic mode is the best for 
A beginners, and is far from 

« l easy. Pro mode, on the 
^ other hand, is damn near 


screen playing area, which makes it 
rather tricky to see where you are 
dropping your blocks. It's actually 
better to zoom your camera in and 
then scroll around the play area in 
order to work out where you want to 
drop your blocks. 

The rules are a little different in 
two-player mode. For one thing, 
fireballs don't dry up the water in your 
drain. At the bottom of the screen is a 
gauge with four little characters; a 
water bubble, an ice cube, a fireball 
and a bomb. As the game progresses 
and you earn points, the indicator on 
your gauge moves up. When one of 
the little characters starts jumping 
around, that means you have access 
to a special attack, and with the press 
of a button you can launch this upon 


Wetrix is weird, wild and incredibly 
addictive. It might not appeal to you if 
you're not keen on puzzle games, 
although you might surprise yourself if 
you give it a try. The difficulty level Is a 
bit of a stumbling block to start with, 
but it's also something which gives the 
game the long term playability that 
really makes it value for money. If you 
like puzzle games and don't have 
one for your N64 yet, then you 
definitely need to buy this. \jgff

nd opinion 


SUCKER FOR THIS KINO OF 
ACTION-PUZZLE HYBRID, AND WETRIX IS 
ONE OF THE BETTER EXAMPLES OF THE 
GENRE BECAUSE IT MOVES AWAY FROM THE 
STANDARD TETRIS FORMULA AND ADOS 
SOME NEW IDEAS. OOOLY, I PREFERRED 
THE SINGLE-PLAYER GAME. BECAUSE IT’S 
MUCH EASIER TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

If you ever wanted 
to LIVE in a fantasy 
world, be warned 
-this one’s as dull 
as the real one! 




Way, way back in the history 
I of videogames, you could tell 
an adventure game from its 
name. They were called things like 
Adventure. Or, if you owned a ZX81, 
Adventure A. Or Adventure B. Or... 
well, you can probably work out the 
other two in the series for yourself. 

Someone at THQ obviously had a 
quick look at a thesaurus, because 
their latest game is called Quest. 
Synonyms aside, it doesn’t have much 
in common with its distant ancestors. 
Back then, you had to type GO WEST 


to get anywhere, and most of the time 
the response would be YOU FALL 
DOWN A PIT AND DIE. These days, of 
course, you get to see your trip in 
glorious, fully animated. Technicolor 
3*D. Surely an improvement? We’ll see. 


Quest 64 is the N64’s first ‘proper’ 
RPG - while Konami’s Goemon had 
some RPG elements (character 
interaction, finding and using objects), 
it was for the most part a platform 
game. Quest makes sure from the start 
that you won’t mistake it for anything 
as frivolous, by excluding a jump 
button. Of course, this does mean that 
the hero can be stymied by obstacles

the height of the average matchbox, 
but hey. this is a fantasy world. 

Said hero is called, erm. Brian. 

Now. without wanting to offend the 
literally dozens of Brians who read 64 
Magazine, it's hardly the most stirring 
name you could find, is it? Fantasy 
heroes should be called things like 
Aragorn and Conan and Kuldath the 
Invincible, not Nicholas or Clive or 
Dominic the Accountant. On the box 
art Brian looks like a manga-style 
rendered teenager, a heroic Luke 
Skywalker type on a mission. In the 
game he looks about eight, a rosy- 
cheeked muppet wearing his bigger 
brother’s hand-me-downs. Which do 
you believe? 

Brain's ‘quest' (clever wording, 
cheers) is to find his missing father 
and recover a magical book, without 
which Celtland. the world In which the 
game takes place, will plunge into 
chaos and despair - the usual fantasy 
stuff. Being an apprentice Spirit Tamer 


(a magician, not a tonic) Brian has the 
ability to learn magical spells as his 
skills and experience grow. 

I Wandered

Celtland is a big place, 
presented with simplistic but

e N64's first 'proper' RPG 


Brian’s magical skills are based on his control of the four elements - air. earth, fire 
and water. The mop-topped magician gains extra strength in the elements by either 
winning in battle, or finding them conveniently lying around the place. 

Elements can be combined in combat as Brian's power grows. Water magic plus 
earth magic acts as a healing spell, for instance, while earth magic plus fire magic 
sends a rock bowling along to knock down enemies! 


seen on the N64. While they’re a long 
way behind the detail of Banjo- 
Kazooie, the simplicity of the 
landscapes means players can see a 
long way into the distance - clipping 
is almost non-existent. When you’re 
out on an open plain, you can see a 
long way. Squint a bit and it looks 
almost real, if angular. 

It's a pity this realism doesn’t 
extend to the inhabitants of Celtland. 
They have a nice manga look to them, 
like Final Fantasy VII on the 


bread) or useful advice, but most of 
them just repeat the same inanities in 
slightly different ways. 

Some months back, before the 
game was finished, developers 
Imagineer said that there would be 
other characters who could join the 
hero in his quest, namely a princess 
and a pirate. Hmm. guess they never 
got round to putting them in. Brain

world on his own, which is a bit of a 
bummer for an eight-year-old. 

These dangers come in the shape 
of numerous mutant monsters, who 
pop up from nowhere as Brian 
wanders around. The combat system 
is straightforward enough; Brian can 
either hit them with his staff, or use 


►CROCB DRIFK oblclntdl

ITEMS LIKE HEALTH-RESTORING DREAD 
OR. IN THIS CASE, A POTION THAT 
REGENERATES YOUR MAGIC 


one of his magic spells. Fights are 
turn-based, Brian alternating his 
attacks with one enemy at a time. A 
circle around each fighter shows how 
far they can move in their turn, and a 
larger circle shows the boundaries of 
the current barney - if things are 
getting too hot, Brian can run from the 
outer circle and leg it. 

Fighting Farce 

The system is simple enough - maybe 
a bit too simple. After a while, combat 
becomes extremely tedious, and to get 
anywhere in a bearable amount of 
time, you just end up making for the 
outer boundary of the combat zone as 
quickly as possible. You can't avoid 
getting into a fight - monsters appear 
from the ether entirely at random, with 
no warning of approaching danger. 

Wandering monsters are a long¬ 
standing part of videogame RPGs, and 


to be honest they're a part that I wish 
programmers would realise everyone 
finds a complete pain in the arse. 
Quest 64 is a particularly bad 
offender. There are times in the game 
when, having just despatched one 
gang of unwelcome wanderers, Brian 
literally only takes two steps before 
another bunch appear from nowhere. 

It's not as though these random 
enemies are easy to defeat, either. 
Early enemies can be taken out with 
just a couple of spells or a swift whack 
from Brian's trusty staff, but it doesn't 
take long before much tougher freaks 
appear, and in numbers. 

Here's a test for you, based on real 
events: Brian has 100 hit points, and 
can inflict a maximum of 30 points of 
damage per attack. Facing him are four 
enemies, each of whom can survive at 
least three of Brian's mightiest blows, 
and themselves inflict up to 30 points 


To be honest, even Goemon is more of a

of damage per round on the tufty¬ 
haired little fella. Which side is going 
to win? As our American cousins would 
say, “do the math." 

Never Say Die 

Although you never actually 'die' as 
such - the worst that can happen after 
losing a fight is that you begin again 
at your last save point, where you can 
regenerate your energy - losing in 
combat becomes an annoyingly 
frequent event, because it doesn't 
take long before the sheer power and 
number of opponents overwhelms 
you. Early on in the game you 
encounter a boss who is holding one 
of the four elements you need to find. 
Basically, the first time you meet him, 
he hammers you. Unless you've got a 
plentiful stock of health-reviving Hovis 
in your bag and a hit point score

around the 70 mark, you’ll have a 
truly tough time beating him. 

So what’s the problem there? 
Simply put, in normal play you’d never 
get up to that level by the time you 
meet the boss! Instead, you have to 
wander aimlessly around outside the 
castle and in the woods, beating up 
wandering monsters and gaining 
experience and extra hit points. About 
an hour should do it. While you’re 
doing that, are you progressing in the 
adventure? Are you learning new 
tactics? Are you having any kind of fun 
at all? Are you buggery. You’re just 
running into the same seven or eight 
monsters over and over again and 
using the same techniques each time 
to bring them down. 

Another less than impressive 
feature was the saving system. The 
game can only be saved at inns (which 
can be a long way apart), and Quest 
64 also managed to crash while I was 
saving a game, losing all my saved 
games and, more to the point, nuking 


points and magic to a useable level 
once more. There’s a word for this kind 
of situation, and that word is 
‘fugginbollogshidwenktwaddin- 
arzoles!’ Or something similar. 

No-Brain Brian 

All this might be tolerable if Quest 64 
had other elements to catch the 
imagination, but there’s not a hell of a 
lot else to the game. The plot and 
setting are identikit fantasy stuff that 
could have been thought up in half an 
hour by anyone who’d ever read a bit 
of Tolkien, the other characters Brian 
meets play no real part in the story, 
and the puzzles... sorry, what puzzles? 
The nearest thing you’ll find to 
puzzles are the locked gates blocking 
the way at certain points. As it turns 
out, these open automatically once 
Brian kills the local boss. Wow, 
solving that nearly made my brain 
implode! Ooooooh! 

Getting through the game is almost 
entirely dependent on combat, which

my until-then loopercent reliable

not only had a dead memory card, but 
also had to start the game again from 
scratch, meaning another tedious 
process of beating up wandering 
monsters until I’d built up Brian’s hit 



“My god," thought Brian, “I’ve

in turn is dependent on running round 
in circles until another gang of 
ridiculous Brian-fodder materialises, 
then killing them to boost your hit 
points and gain magic. To be honest, 
even Goemon is more of a true RPG 
than Quest - it’s got multiple 
characters, puzzles, an actual plot... 

It would be unfair to compare Quest 
64 to something like Final Fantasy W/, 
since that game has three CDs 
(1950Mb, or i5,6ooMbits - 60 Zelda 
64s!) to play with, instead of a single 
128Mbit cartridge. Even so, there’s a 
lot of wasted space that could have 
been put to better use - rooms with 
nothing in them, characters who don’t 
do anything, vast areas of land with no 
purpose that take ages to run across. 
Had the designers not been so keen to 
make a real(ish) world, they could 
have created one that was interesting

instead. Even the text-only adventures 
of old were more involving. Stupid 
monsters do not a fantasy world make, 
and spending a good 30 minutes 
running and fighting along a barren 
path just to reach the next save point 
may be fun for marathon runners, but 
not for anyone sane. 

Quest 64 is almost a junior RPG - 
the basics of the genre are there, but 
simplified to the absolute bare 
minimum. There’s not enough 
content to keep older players 
interested, but the younger players 
at whom the game seems to be 
aimed will get bored very quickly 
with the endless trudging about. 

Let’s just hope that Zelda 64 doesn’t 
make the same mistakes.

To DATE, IF YOU WANT A REALLY 
amazing and realistic racing 
game, the sad truth is that 
youMl also need a PlayStation to run it 
on. Where Sony’s box boasts world- 
class wheel action from the likes of 
Gran Turismo, Rage Racer, TOCA 
Touring Car, Fi ’97 and V-Rally, N64 
owners have been subjected to the 
I rather less awesome Fi Pole 
w Position, Multi Racing 
Championship, Automobili 
Lamborghini and - ack! spit! - Cruis'n 
USA. Even the better Nintendo driving 
games like Top Gear Rally aren’t really 
Moet sprayers. 

GT 64 Championship Edition is 
Ocean’s second attempt at an N64 
racer, the first being the dreary and 
ditchwater-dull MRC. Coming from 


Imagineer, who also produced MRC, I 
wasn’t expecting that much from it, 
especially after playing the game at 
E3 in May (see last issue) and being 
distinctly unimpressed. 

In fact, after the E3 experience, I 
fully expected to hate GT 64. As it 
turns out, I didn’t. The only problem 
was, I didn’t love it either. In fact, I 
didn’t feel anything for it at all. 

I’m a Freelance 
Scientist 

As the annoying tosser in the Metz 
adverts says, “Gentlemen, let me 
explain,” GT 64 is based on the 
Japanese Grand Touring 
championship, where instead of the 
poxy Vectras and Mondeos that get 
slammed around in similar events in 
Blighty, top-spec sports cars like 
Skylines, Supras, NSXs and even the 
odd Lamborghini are thrashed until 
they beg for mercy. Sounds like fun! 

That’s the theory. However, 
what makes this kind of 
racing a crowd-pleaser when 
compared to the current

GT 64 Championship Edition

GT64 AT LEAST OFFERS SOME REASONARLY COOL CARS FOR YOU TO SLAM INTO WALLS, 

SUCH AS THE lOYOTA SUPRA, NiSSAN SkYLINE GT-R, HONDA NSX (AS DRIVEN BY MR WOLF), 

Lamborghini Diablo and Porsche 911 (or is it a 959?) However, we’re not too

drivers chinning each other with long 
metal poles. 

6T64 manages to deliver the tight 
courses part of this equation, but falls 
short on the others. This originally 
being a Japanese game, the cars are 
set up to favour the Nipponese 
penchant for powersliding. At first, the 
cars seem all but impossible to get 
around the corners, bringing up 
Vietnam-style flashbacks of San 
Francisco Rush and Its incredible jelly 
steering. Make a turn and your car sails 
gracefully sideways into the nearest 
crash barrier. Practice for a while, 
though, and before long you get the 
hang of when to turn, when to brake 
and when to pour on the power to 
make some smart edge-of-adhesion 
fast exits from hairpins. You’ll still sail 
gracefully sideways into the barrier, but 
at least it won’t happen nearly as often. 

You can make things easier on 
yourself by toying with the car setup 
screen before the race starts.

The Tokyo Long course actually offers one almost exciting bit, where you have to duck

Selecting the ‘auto’ option gives a 
basic setup that will get you around 
the course, but you can adjust tyre 
compounds, suspension stiffness, 
spoilers and gearing to suit your 
preferences and the needs of the track. 
Street circuits, with their tight corners, 
need more downforce, but more open 
tracks (Lake Fuji in the Japanese 
version, a generic ‘Europe’ in the West) 
give you more leeway on the turns so 
you can go all-out for speed.

Tracks Of My Fears 

Actually, that should really be ‘more

early problems is the puny selection 
of courses - a mere three. Ocean have 
tried to camouflage this by offering 
short and long versions of each 
course, and there’s also a secret 
American track which becomes 
available if you win the championship 
game, but really you’re faced with 
just three circuits. 

This wouldn’t be so bad if the 
three courses were something special 
{Ridge Racer got away with just 
having the one), but they’re all 
rather bland, with not much of

interest to look at. You might argue 
that since the courses are based on 
real tracks, they may actually be 
accurate. Well, aren't you the little 
smartarse? The thing is. if a game’s 
trying to be realistic, it should 
exaggerate reality, not just mimic it. 
Real life is full of boring bits and 
annoying stuff you could do without. 
ISS wouldn’t be half as much fun If 
you had to sit through a simulated 
coach journey to the ground before 
you could play, would it? 

Given that GT 64 is apparently a 
128M cartridge, and therefore rather 
more hefty than MRC, you’d expect a 
lot more variety In the tracks - in fact, 
a lot more tracks full stop. Where the 


worlds packed with detail, music, cool 
visual effects, precise control and 
lashings of imagination. The other is 
GT64. Maybe all those rather grainy 
digitised pictures of real cars occupy 
32 megabits, but I doubt it. 

Corner Chop 

Another major failing of GT 64 comes 
from the opposition, made up of a 
bunch of robot Michael Schumachers 
who cruise around the course on the 
perfect racing line and never, ever 
make a mistake. More to the point, 
they don* t powerslide. For you to get 
Into the lead, you have to master the 
art of braking late, whipping the back 
end out and slamming on the power 
as you try to duck through on the 
inside. Not so if you’re lucky enough 
to be a computer-controlled drone - 
you get to corner like a Rothmans- 
sponsored tram. While human players 
are skipping inexorably sideways into 
a pile of tyres, the N64’s boyz are 
flicking V signs through the windows 
and squeezing the bulbs of their 
Seymour Butts stick-on window toys. 

This perfect cornering is there 
simply to compensate for the CPU 
racers having no brains whatsoever.

the PlayStation mob were sitting six 
feet away wetting themselves over the 
rather good Colin McRae Rally, and 
then deliberately putting on Gran 
Turismo just to really annoy me. 

Two-Play, Away! 

Not even the two-player game, which 
can normally add some excitement to 
a game, served to increase my heart 
rate. While it at least spares players 
the indignity of MRCs microscopic 
split screens, the frame rate is 
massively reduced, which makes 
controlling the cars around the corners 
all the more difficult. It does sharpen 
your competitive edge - there’s a race 
to see who can be first to stick 
Goldeneye in the cart slot instead. 

The biggest disappointment about 
GT 64 is the fact that it had the 
potential to be something really

amazing, but blew it. The game 
plunges into the deep chasm between 
full-on simulation and all-out action 
without touching either side on the 
way down. Some things are simulated 
fairly well, like the powersliding, but 
other things are completely ignored. 
You can’t spin out the cars properly or 
go doughnutting, you can’t roll them 
or even get them to leave the ground 
on a hump and despite the claims of 
the advertising, I didn’t manage to 
damage them, no matter how hard I 
tried. (And I tried, believe me.) 

On the other hand, the action isn’t 
exciting or involving enough for GT 64 
to work as an arcade racer either. Even 
though it moves at a reasonable pace, 
you never end up with sweaty palms 
after barely making it through a series 
of tight corners. (Unless you’re Roy, 
whose Nixon-style palmic perspiration 
is both legendary and gross...) 

GT64 commits the ultimate sin for 
any racing game. It’s boring. You could 
play it all day, and it still wouldn’t be 
able to coax the tiniest drop of 


adrenaline from your glands. Compared 
to even the three year old Ridge Racer 
on PlayStation it’s badly lacking in fun 
and thrills, and up against the likes of 
Gran Turismo, GT 64 is a joke. The N6 a 
can kick the competition’s ass in so 
many game genres, so why the hell 
can’t it scrape up just one world- 
class racer? l|9r

© Since the UK has practically

that the likes of American football and 
baseball would have been adopted as

despite the best efforts of Channel 4

sporting pastimes have never really 
been accepted wholesale by the 
’fickle Brits’. With that in mind, why

O Amazingly realistic hi-res 

GRAPHICS 

O Staggering array of gaming 

OPTIONS 

O Long gaming lifespan 


All-Star Baseball allows you 

TO DESIGN THE BEST, WORST, OR 
THE MOST IMPROBABLE BASEBALL 
PLAYERS IN THE WORLD. 


O Rudimentary knowledge of 


Batter Up 

The game has been developed by 
Iguana Entertainment, the talented 
bods behind the likes of Turok, and it 
has their hallmark of quality stamped 
throughout the game. The first thing 
that hits you after sticking the cart in 
your Minnie is the astounding high-res 
graphics on display - it’s an 
astonishing sight as you watch the 
perfectly rendered baseball teams 
stride out onto the pitch. From the off, 
this exemplifies All-Star BasebaWs 
main strength, and that is its amazing 
attention to detail. Hell, you can 
almost smell the hot dogs! 

But how does it play? Well, bearing 
in mind that the majority of people in 
this country have never played 
baseball (or even know the rules), it is 
easy to get lost within the whole 
experience. The instructions supplied 
with the cart are not particularly good, 
feeling knocked together and not very 
clear on some points. It would also 
have been a good idea to summarise 
the basic baseball rules and terms 
within the manual, but Acclaim 
probably assumed that only baseball 
fans will pick up the game. 

The wealth of gaming options 
available in All-Star Baseball is 
daunting for the novice player, since 
you have full control over your team - 
from pitching to batting, fielding to 


managing... you get the idea. 

However, in a stroke of gameplaying 
genius you have the option of 
controlling more or less what you like. 
For instance, if you want to 
concentrate on your pitching, the 
computer will do the basic fielding for 
you, so all you need to do is press the 
A button at the right time to catch the 
incoming ball. 

Another example of the sheer user- 
friendliness of the game is displayed 
when you are at bat; you can have a 
batting target on screen to help you 
set up your shot, as well as having an 
icon telling you where the pitcher is 
lobbing the ball. Although the latter 
options don’t guarantee a home run 
every time (believe me, it isn’t that 
easy), it will certainly help you find 
your feet and prepare you for taking 
on the more advanced gaming options. 

You also have complete control 
over how you ‘see’ the game - there is 
an adjustable camera which can either 
be close behind the batter, just 
behind the catcher, to the side, or 
from slightly above. There are three 
fielding options, although the most 
practical is the ‘high’ option, which 
lets you see for yourself whether the 
opposition is going to nick another 
one of your bases. However, the ‘low’ 
option needs to be seen, just so you 
can drool over the gorgeous hi-res

graphics. The great thing about all of 
these options is that you are able to 
change them at anytime during the 
game - so, if you're the indecisive 
sort, you can mix and match to your 
heart’s content! 

Steee-rike! You’re 
Out Of There! 

All of the major current American 
baseball teams and players are 
represented within the game, 
although you also have the option of 
creating your own players - yes, you 
too could become a baseball star 
(well, just as long as you’re a bloke, 
you don’t wear glasses and have no 
physical deformities - who says that 
these are enlightened times, eh?) In 
addition, for those who demand a 
multiplayer option, All-Star Baseball 
allows up to four players to compete 
against each other, or team up against 


a CPU opponent. Although you may 
find it difficult to find four friends who 
are interested and know how to play 
baseball, the multiplayer option 
certainly adds a further degree of 
long-term playability to the package. 

All-Star Baseball '99 is a true 
representative of what a 64*bit game 
is ail about. Something that pushes 
the machine and the player, as well as 
having the kind of depth usually only 
found In Loch Ness. Since you can 
create your own players, train them, 
manage them through a season or a 
set of playoff matches, it will be a 
long, long time before you’ve 
exhausted the game’s long-term 
playability. And, after all, if you’ve 
forked out over £50 for a game, this 
kind of ’comeback’ appeal has to be a 
major plus point. 

If you don’t like baseball, apart from 
the ‘pretty pictures’ on display, All-Star 
Baseball probably won’t interest you. 
However, If you are even remotely 
interested In the sport, you owe it to 


yourself to check this game out, as it is 
probably one of the best sport 
simulations ever created. Really, it is 
that good. The atmosphere and the 
amount of control you have over the 
game will soon suck you in, and It won’t 
be long before you too are cursing the 
catcher, as he smugly declares “Steee- 
rike! You’re out of there!"

with a few differences. As with Puyo

of Puzzle Dama is the frozen blobs 
that drop down at random and must

other blobs. You can unfreeze them in 
two ways. The first is to construct a

blob grouping next to them, which will 
defrost any frozen ones when it bursts. 
The second way is to use a special 
‘happy ball’ which drops down from 
time to time, and will defrost any blobs 
that it touches. 

Of course, you can’t have a ‘happy 
ball’ without an evil ‘mean ball’ 
counterpart, can you? The ‘mean ball’ 
also drops down from time to time and 
freezes any blobs that It touches, so 
it’s essential to steer it away from 
large blob groups. 

And that’s about it. Oh, 
except for the pink ‘pacman’ 
ball that starts off frozen but 
will munch its way through a 
line of blobs when you defrost it.

The second game mode in Puzzle 
Dama looks similar to the first and is 
played in the same kind of arena. The 
gameplay, however, differs greatly. 
Instead of blobs dropping down the 
screen in small groups, they rise up

mass. To make the blobs disappear, 
and thus stop the group from reaching 
the top, you must pick up a blob and 
physically place it with other blobs. 
This gives you a little more control 
over the action, and you’ll probably 
find it easier. This game doesn’t 
utilise the happy, mean and pacman 
bails, so things are therefore 
somewhat simplified. 

Both the Puyo Puyoesque games 
can be played In either one- or two- 
player mode. If you manage to 
achieve large groups or set off chain 
reactions where multiple groups 
disappear, then the blobs you remove 
will drop onto your opponent’s screen 
In a frozen state. The novel concept 
here is that each playable character, 
as well as having a different 
animation, has a different pattern for 


Balls, Balls, Balls! 

There are three different rails in Puzzle Dama 

AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEARN WHAT THEY DO. 


Happy Ball 

This useful ball 

DEFROSTS ANY 
BLOBS THAT IT 
TOUCHES. 


Mean Ball 

This not-so-useful ball 

FREEZES ANY 




Pacman Ball 

When thawed, this ball 

WILL EAT ALL 
THE BLOBS IN 
ITS WAY. 


dropping blocks on opponents. Rather 
than simply dropping blocks from the 
top, they might be inserted at the 
bottom, or slipped in at the side, or 
even a combination of all three. With 
experimentation you can find out 
which kind of attack works best - on 
the first Puyo Puyo-iype game for 
example, if the blocks appear at the 
bottom of the screen, they are often 
harder to remove than If they get 
dropped from the top. 

Bowling Blobs 

The third game In Puzzle Dama is 
totally different from the other two. 

It’s a bowling game, and can be 
played by up to four players! The 
bowling alley is viewed from the side, 
and players take it in turns to bowl at 
the skittles at the end of the alley 
using the analogue stick for power 
and spin. Although this section 
probably wouldn’t stand up as a game 
on its own (unless it was sold for a 
tenner) it is damn good fun all the 
same, and makes a nice change from 
frantic blob bursting. 

All In all. Puzzle Dama is great fun, 
and the three-ln-one game format 
probably makes it better value for 
money than, for example, Puyo Puyo. 
However, at £6o on Import. It’s 
dubious whether it’s really worth the 
money to start with - after all, it is just 
a puzzle game. Then again, you’ll 
probably be coming back to this game 



The mean-looking balls are a bit of 

A PAIN. If THEY MAKE CONTACT WITH 
YOUR BLOBS THEY TURN THEM INTO 
FROZEN BLOCKS. 


long after you tire of the current crop 
of platform, driving and sports games, 
so maybe It Is worth It. The choice, as 
they say, is yours!

A MAD Japanese puzzle 

GAME WITH ANIME

DIDN’T LIKE PuZZLE DaMA QUITE AS MUCH 

AS Puyo Puyo because it takes less 

SKILL TO SET OFF CHAIN REACTIONS. BUT

basketball, especially if you’re 
not American and haven’t 
been bottle-fed on odd colonial sports 
since popping out of the womb. To the 
uninitiated, it looks like a bunch of 
very tall men In shorts running hither 
and yon over a wooden-floored tennis 
court, throwing a ball into a basket 
first at one end of the court, then the 
other. By the end of the game, the 
score is about 3.002 to 3,001. What’s 
wrong with the Americans? Can’t they 
appreciate the thrills of a nil-nil draw 
ora 27 all out? Cuh! 

Kobe Bryant In NBA Courtside, 
apart from sounding like the name of 
a bad American sitcom, is one of the 
first members of Nintendo’s ‘Nintendo 



Sports’ line-up. much ballyhooed at 
E3 .1 still don’t know (or especially 
care) who Kobe Bryant is, but the 
Kobester has put his name on quite a 
decent game. 

Space Jam 

For the basketball-impaired, things are 
helped along by a very clever passing 
system; since the players in the game 
are professionals, the game assumes 
that 99 percent of the time they’re 
going to chuck the ball around fairly 
accurately, so you rarely need to worry 
that you’ll pass the ball only to find

empty space where you hoped there’d 
be a team-mate. Passing plays are 
made on the run by moving the 
analogue stick in the general direction 
of the player you want to pass to and 
pressing A. Although it sounds a bit 
vague, it*s one of the best passing 
methods in any sports sim to date. 

Glory-seekers can take a shot at 
the basket at any time by pressing 
and holding B. The chances of getting 
the ball through the hoop obviously 
increase the closer you are, but there 
Is still the chance of pulling a blinder 
from the opposite end of the court.

Lanky Yankee 

With four people playing, NBA 
Courtside becomes a frenzy of 
pituitary-fuelled action. The small size 
of the court compared to a football 
pitch means that the action moves 
from end to the other very quickly, and 
the ease of passing keeps the game 
flowing like mercury through a teflon- 
lined pipe. Obviously it helps if you’re 
into basketball, which is a small-time 
sport over here, but if you switch off 
some of the more incomprehensible 
rules like the numerous time-based 
penalties and goal tending (it’s an 
offence to try to stop the opposition 


ketball fan, NBA Courtside 


nd opinion 


-7 

I’VE BEEN KNOWN TO CHUCK 
THE ODD BALL THROUGH A 

HOOP, AND NBA Courtside is the best 
SIMULATION OF THE GAME ON THE N64 BY 
A MILE. The PASSING SYSTEM IS 
SMOOTHER THAN A VELVET CAT, AND THE 
GAME IS HEAVY ON PRESENTATION. IF YOU 
don't like BASKETBALL YOU WON’T BE 
CONVERTED. BUT IT’S A GOOD, FAST 
VERSION OF THE SPORT. LOZ CoOPER 


Rating: 





of NBA Pro *98, Courtside*s only real 
competition, but the clarity of the 
American version is missing. 

If you’re a basketball fan with an 
N64, NBA Courtside will be an 
essential buy. It looks good, plays well 
and has enough options to choke a 
camel, as well as being loaded down 
with all the tedious statistics that 
American sports fans get so excited 
about. On the other hand, if the 
squeak of trainers on wood doesn’t 
get your blood pumping It’s not going 
to be next on your list after Banjo- 
Kazooie, but you might still be 
pleasantly surprised if you’re 
willing to give it a go. 


The whole thing Is a bit random, since 
unlike a football game you can’t pick 
a side of the goal to aim at. but then 
that’s a problem all basketball sims 
are stuck with. 

NBA Courtside has a wide range of 
offensive and defensive moves, which 
unlike some games are 
straightforward enough to use 
regularly In play. If you’ve got the ball, 
holding R puts you into a defensive 
crouch while you look for someone to 
pass to, but doing the same when 
you’re trying to tackle automatically 
keeps you right in the ball-holder’s 
face. You can also do neat tricks like 


will be an essential buy 


from scoring a basket - the hell?), 
pretty much anybody can drop straight 
into the game and start playing. 

It does have to be said that the PAL 
conversion is a bit disappointing. 
Although NBA Courtside runs full¬ 
screen on British TVs, there’s a 
definite loss of speed compared to the 
NTSC game, as though someone had 
swapped the players’ isotonic energy 
drinks for Horlicks. Everything also 
seems a little bit fuzzier than before - 
it’s not the Incredible Blur-O-Scope^*^ 



The ‘REFEREE’can re set with varying 
DEGREES OF STRICTNESS WHEN IT COMES 
TO SPOTTING FOULS. RUT EVEN DR CVCLOPS

6A CHEAT 

CENTRAL 


Are you a baseball fan? No? That’s 
a PITY, because we’ve got millions 
of stick-related cheats this issue. ' 
Luckily, there’s plenty of other 
STUFF as well! — 


Scin 
-rancisco 


Oops! The cover book we gave away 
free with issue 14 provided maps for 
all seven levels in SF Rush, the 
seventh being the secret Rock level. 
Only we didn’t realise that we’d 
neglected to tell you how to get 
access to said track - doh! 

Access Secret Track 

To begin with you need to have 
completed a circuit and have it stored 
in memory. If you haven’t done this 
yet and want to speed things up, then 
try entering the following winning 
circuit code: 

8 DP 5 KG 5 L 4 G 59 P 

G 92 WVCQY 0 DRDQ 

Apparently one or two versions of the 
game may not accept the above code, 
in which case use this one instead: 
9 DQ 6 LH 6 M 5 H 6 $Q 
H$ 3 XWCR 01 DTDR 

Once you’ve entered the code, finish 
the circuit. You then need to use the A 
and B buttons to move between 
selection screens. 

1. On car selection screen: Hold C Left, 
press Z, release both and press Left. 

2. On setup screen: Hold C Up, press 
Z, release both and press Up 

3. On track selection screen: Hold C 
Right, press Z, release both and 
press Right 

4. On car selection screen: Hold C 
Down, press Z, release both and 
press Down, L, R 

3. Go to the track selection screen and 
choose track seven. Woohoo!

Alternate Floors 

Complete the eight single 
player practice rounds, then go to 
the options screen and select the 
‘Floor’ option to toggle a new 
background colour and floor 
pattern. Groovy.

You’ve got the completely mapped 
solution. You’ve got the cheat code 
which gives infinite everything. You’re 
still rubbish at it? Try this cheat which 
lets you pass through walls, and if you 
still can’t finish, give it up! 

No Clipping Mode 

Enter NOCLIP as a password. 


Forsdken 


Fast, furious and gory with a multiplayer mode that arguably 
rivals Goldeneye for addictiveness. Forsaken is definitely a must-buy for 
N64 owners. And if you’ve already bought it. here are some codes to make 
it even better!

On the opening screen, press A,

select screen. There are eight secret 
characters in total: Septre, Ex-Cop, 
Jo, Nubia, Cerbero, Mephistofun, 
HK-5, and Dr Nepenthe (Nutta). 

If you’ve unlocked Battle mode 
you can also access the characters 
by killing them on one of the eight 
Battle mode levels.They also 
sometimes appear in Multiplayer 
mode as one of the CPU opponents 
(if you have them activated).

buy it. However, for those die-hard fans out there, here’s a few handy codes! 

Bonus Teams 

Highlight ‘Exhibition’ and repeatedly tap all the C buttons together until you 
hear a noise to confirm that the code has been entered correctly. You’ll now

wagazme^ 


Well done to Adam 
Charlton from Buckden 
who is this month’s winner 
of the Ultimate Player 
award with his top times 
on Diddy Kong Racing. A 
Trident pad and memory 
card are on the way Adam! 

I This month sees the first 
scores for Quake 64 - and 
about time too! We’d also 
like to thank the reader 
who suggested in their 
letter that the ScoreZone 
might be more accessible if 
people could send in 
photos as well as videos - 
duh, we’d, like, never have 
thought of that! 


MUG SHOTS 

The best of the best may, if they're 
lucky (and photogenic) enough, have the 
honour of getting their face in the 
magazine! Send us a snapshot of your 
grinning mug and who knows, you may 
end up guming from our hallowed pagesli 


VIDEO STARSI 

Sehding us video proof of your 

ACHIEVEMENT? OKAY, REMEMBER TO 

FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE RULES! 

• Please list on a sheet of paper, or on 
the video label, the scores which are 
on the video. 

• Ensure that the video is in the right 
place, ready to go. 

• Put your name on it! (I know this 
sounds obvious, but we’ve already 
had one anonymous entry) 


ENTER 
THE ZONE! 

Follow these easy steps 

FOR ACHIEVING ENTRY TO THE 

64 Magazine annals of fame: 

• Get a top score or time on an 
N64 game 

• Take a photo or a video to record 
your time 

• Send the proof of your prowess 
to 64 Scorezone» 64 Magazine, 
Paragon House, St Peter*s Road, 
Bournemouth, BHi 2jS 

• Include an SAE if you want your 
photos/videos back 


DEADLINE 

DILEMMA! 

Following a number of concerned 
phone-calls to the 64 Magazine 
offices, we thought we’d better 
explain something about our editorial 
deadlines. Owing to design and 
printing pressures, by the time you 
get to read the latest issue of the 
mag, we’re already halfway through 
writing the next one. If you don’t 
send your scores in immediately, they 
probably won’t make it into the next 
issue. Rest assured though that your 
scores will get printed (providing 
they’re good enough!) so please 
don’t start phoning up demanding to 
know why they haven’t. We do try to 
hold ScoreZone back from the 
printers as late as possible, so we’re 
doing our best! 





One person each month wiU be The 
Chosen One. Chosen, that is. to win 
themselves a Trident Pad and 256K 
memory card from Logic 3! The 
player whose prowess impresses us ^ 

the most will win themselves the 
coveted title of Ultimate Player. It could 
be you - get ready to play! 

For non-ultimate players, the Trident Pad costs 
£19.99 and the 256K memory card costs £6.99. 

You can call Logic 3 on (0181) 900 0024!

Secret 2 

Enter the dark room with the two 
Death Knights along the balcony 
and then jump into the water. 
Swim to the right to find a Mega 
Health in the second secret area 
located just underneath the 
small flight of stairs. 









□ 













































































































Qvidke 



Secret 1 


After climbing the stairs rising from the first lava pool, stop at the top and 
look for a switch high on the right hand wall. Shooting this switch will cause 
a door to open just above the lava - It contains a portal, jump into this 
portal to be transported to the first secret area located on the rafters above. 
Collect some Red Armour from this area and then drop off the right hand 
side of the rafters to return to the top of the stairs. 




Walkthrough 

Run down the right hand side of the 
stairs and obliterate the unsuspecting 
Ogre, then activate the switch behind 
the staircase. Now return the way you 
came and splatter a Death Knight 
approaching from the door in the left 
hand corner. Pass through the door to 
the left and stand on the floor switch 
to raise some stairs to cross the lava. 
Run up the stairs and splatter the 
Death Knight waiting at the top, then 
select your grenade launcher and 
continue along the corridor. 

Blast the Zombies hiding around 
the corners then pick up the Super 

Icons Key: 

Weapons & Ammo 


Nailgun and turn to the right. Enter 
the dark room directly ahead and fight 
a couple more Death Knights before 
climbing the stairs and following the 
balcony around to a lift. Ride the lift 
up and then turn to your left; you will 
see a dark corridor filled with more 
Zombies. Grenade the rotting undead 
wasters before entering the passage 
as it is riddled with nail traps, then 
run to the other end as fast as 
possible to limit the amount of 
damage you sustain. 

Another Ogre waits at the far end. 
so give him a taste of your nailgun,

then enter the room ahead. Blast the 
Scrag floating around the entrance 
then step onto the floor switch to 
form a bridge across the lava pool. 
Walk to the centre of the pool and 
activate the switch on the floor to 
raise a bridge leading to the alcove on 
your right. Run over this new bridge 
and then activate the floor switch in 
the alcove, being careful not to be 
squashed by the spiked ceiling trap. 
Quickly turn around and slaughter a 
Death Knight and the pair of Scrags 
that have appeared behind you, then 
run across to the other side of the 
bridge and carefully activate the floor 
switch in the alcove there. The final 
bridge will now be raised and you can 
cross the lava pool and enter the 
^ portal to return to the foot of the 
^ stairs where you started. 


Run up the stairs and turn around 
to total a Death Knight and an Ogre 
waiting in the doorway. Follow the 
passage to the end where you will 
discover another lava pool, and a floor 
switch which again causes a bridge to 
appear. As soon as the bridge is in 
position, run across as fast as you can 
and drop into the passage on the 
other side. Battle with the Death 
Knight here, then pick up the Silver 
Rune Key and step into the portal to 
return to the foot of the stairs. Turn to 
your left and open the silver door, 
then backtrack and blast the 
approaching Fiend. With the him out 
of your way proceed along the 
corridor and down the stairs to the 
very bottom, where you will find a 
switch on the wall. Activate the switch 
and then enter the room to you right. 

There are lots of unfriendly Ogres 
waiting here (are there any other 
kind?), so introduce them to your 
super nailgun and then collect all the 
available Power-Ups. Finally, activate 
the switch on the right hand wall to 
open the door to the exit and return to 
the stairs. Climb back up the stairs 
then explode the Ogre waiting by the 
exit door. You can now pick up some 
green armour and jump into the portal 
to exit this level.

Password: scrI dzcm jj9q lyl3 . 


Walkthrough 

Grab your nailgun and perforate the 
Ogres on either side of your starting 
position, then run down the slope 
and into a large open room. Dive into 
the pool and swim through the 
underwater tunnel into a large pool 
on the other side. Sink the Rotfish 
swimming here, then swim around 
the pool to locate an opening on the 
other side. Jump out of the water and 


onto a small set of stairs leading 
upwards, then follow the passage 
around to the right. Slaughter the 
Ogre waiting beside the bridge 
switch, then turn to the right and nail 
the Ogre waiting on the central 
platform. Activate the switch on the 
left hand wall then cross the bridge to 
the far side, stopping to collect the 
Rocket Launcher on your way. 


Secret 1 

After popping the two Ogres that jump from the balcony, proceed through 
the exit door then turn around and shoot the yellow switch underneath the 
balcony platform. A set of stairs will appear, allowing you to climb up onto 
the balcony. In this secret area you will Find two health power-ups, some 
rockets and some nails.

left and eviscerate the pair of Ogres 
waiting in the room at the bottom. 
Enter the room and activate the switch 
in the right hand corner, then turn 
around to blast the two additional 
Ogres approaching from the balcony 
above. Exit this room via the door 
to the left and follow the passage 
around to the central platform.

central area and continue until you 
reach the far side of the pool. 

Activate the switch on the left and 
ride the lift up to the next floor, 
then walk forwards carefully, 
watching for an Ogre ambush from 
behind. Do the biz on this sneaky 
sod, then peer over the edge at the 
end and use your rocket launcher to 
take out the Ogre below. Once the 
coast is clear carefully step off the 
ledge and land on the platform below. 

Step forwards onto a floating 
platform and allow it to carry you to 
the corner opposite, then jump off to 
do battle with some more unfriendly 
monsters. Follow the corridor to the 
end and step into the lift area - this

started from. Step back onto the 
floating platform and again travel to 
the far end of the corridor, but this 
time stay on the platform and turn to 
the left. 

As the platform moves towards the 
end of the hall, shoot the button 
above the door to squash the Ogre 
underneath, then turn to the right and 
make the Ogre on the platform below 
dance in time to your piercing bullets. 

Stay on the lift until you are in front 
of the door with the switch above, 
then step into this area. Walk through 
the door to your left and step onto 
another floating platform the other 
side. To operate this ferry, turn around 


and shoot the button on the floor 
behind you. jump off this platform 
onto another raised ledge and then 
blast the Ogre and Zombie waiting in 
the room to your right. When the 
coast is clear, step onto the next 
floating platform to be carried over 



into the next area, where a lift is 
waiting to take you to the next floor. 

When the lift stops, quickly jump 
out and do battle with an Ogre and a 
Fiend before collecting the Power-Ups 
and heading down the corridor to the 
left. Blast the Ogre that stands in your 
way then walk carefully down the 
slope, ready to battle the Shambler 
that appears when you reach the 
bottom. Once the Shambler has 
shambled his last, you can now jump 
down to the edge of the lava pool and 
drop through the hole underneath the 
slope to finish this level.

the two caged Ogres at the end of the 
hall, then nail the Death Knight 
approaching from the right. Proceed 
along the passage that leads to the 
right, then get medieval on another 
deadly Vore in the next room. Collect 
the Nails and Health, then enter the 
dark area to the right to pick up the 
Silver Key. As soon as you have

pillar. Stand on the switch to open the 
door opposite and then exit the room

Ammunition before taking a peek at 
the large lava-filled room to the right.

Vores on the upper bridge, then use 
your rocket launcher to blast them to 
pieces. With the Vores out of your way

passage on the other side. Turn to your 
right and slaughter the approaching 
Death Knight, then follow the passage 
around to a long passage guarded by 
two Scrags. Remove these floating 
fools, then walk along the passage and 
stamp on the floor switches to open

has been activated, quickly turn 
around and splatter the two Ogres that 
are attacking from your left.

Scrag waiting in the entrance. Follow 
the passage to the right and then turn 
to your left to toast another couple of 
floating Scrags. Continue along the 


corridor to the end and then kill the 
final Scrag around the last bend. Now 
take the lift up to the final bridge. 
Collect all the items in the doorway, 
then make a run for the other side of 
the bridge. As soon as you cross the 
centre of the bridge two Fiends will 
appear, one in front of you and one 
behind you. Waste the Fiend that’s 
infront of youand run to the far side of

The search for a truly great N64 beat-’em-up is now near an 
end. with Bio Freaks being a massive improvement over all 
that have gone before it. Although it suffers a little bit from 
the slightly stop-start gameplay that seems to be a 
characteristic of Midway fighters, the addition of flight, 
guns and severed limbs makes Bio Freaks a very 
entertaining (and bloody) experience.

A very playable and polished snowboarding simulation 
from the team that created Wave Race, with an absolutely 
superb control method that is probably the most realistic 
in any sports game ever. The realism and graphical 
excellence has a price, though; there are only six race 
courses. However, the stunt modes should help most 
people get over this. 



One of those games that defies categorisation. Blast Corps 
is best described as a combination of racing game and 
puzzler. A nuclear missile carrier is rolling towards 
destruction - you have to use a variety of vehicles to clear a 
safe route for it. It’s destruction on a massive scale and 
good fun, though not that long-lasting unless you’re into 
exploring every square inch.

A distinctly poor attempt to do an air combat game on the

themselves are well-modelled, the game as a whole is 
appallingly slow, with massive borders. It also suffers from 
badly thought out level designs where the bosses can be 
attacked right from the off, meaning some stages can be

On the N64 the battle mode is a profound flop, but the

something that doesn’t exist) played out over a number of 
bizarre courses. Incrementally addictive or boring as hell? 
You be the judge. 



The N64 ’s second wrestling game after WCWVs NWO, and 
it suffers in comparison. Although the look of the game is 
a lot clearer, with the wrestlers looking particularly solid, 
where Brave Spirits (or Tohkon Road, if you prefer) falls

battles can be had. though it relies too much on easily- 
performed super moves. 



Simple graphics. Infuriating chirpy sound. Uncomplicated 
gameplay. A high price when compared to the identical 
PlayStation and Saturn versions. So how come Bust-A-

playable, that’s why! Even as a single-player game it’s fun,

701 SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE 



Hurried out in order to cash in on the excitement festival 
that was the Nagano Olympics, Olympic Hockey ’ 98 is 
j nothing more than Wayne Gretzky ’98 in new national kit, 
and actually has fewer teams than its predecessor. If you 
I have either of the previous Gretzky games, there’s no 
point whatsoever getting this unless you are an ice 
hockey fetishist.

A decidedly dodgy Star Wars cash-in that was hugely 
over-rated when it was first released because of N64 
euphoria. Time hasn’t treated Shadows kindly, though - 
it’s a kind of third-rate Tomb Raider meets Starfox, with 
some very lumpen subgames that should have had their 
throats crushed at birth. “Do, or do not," said Yoda. This 
one does not.

741 SIM CITY 2000 



A game that splits the office to this day. One camp argues 
that the ability to more or less set your own agenda 
provides near-infinite replay value. The other camp 
maintains that there isn’t any real objective and that you 
just waft about over pretty landscapes. Since a member of 
the latter group edits the mag, guess which viewpoint is 
represented here?

This conversion of the creaky old PC game is a bit of an 
oddity, because the mouse-based control of the original 
isn’t really suited to a console. Imagineer give it their best 
though, and if you’ve played the original and know what 
you’re supposed to do (everything’s in Japanese), some 
urban amusement can be had, though it’s lacking in 
excitement and feels very dated.

If It looks like something from the Sega Mega Drive, then 
that’s because it pretty much is. The Puyo Puyo games have 
been around for years, and have changed very little along 
the way. Luckily, they don’t need stunning graphics, 
because this is a game where gameplay is all. Great fun to 
play alone, supremely addictive against a friend - 
campaign for an official release now! 


QUAKE

A massive hit on the PC, Quake comes to the N64 with 
improved graphics and a fair smattering of gore, but sadly 
its deathmatch option is only for two players, as opposed 
to the benchmark-setting Goldeneye's four. This does 
ultimately reduce its longevity, but all the same the one- 
player game is still a lot of aggressive fun. Kill ogres! Shoot 
dogs! Brutalise demons!

An arcade conversion with an unusual three-player mode, 
in which you take on the stamping form of one of three 
movie-style monsters and run around wrecking cities and 
eating people. This kind of action is fun for a while, and 
spotting all the amusing little touches in the game keeps 
you entertained, but the infinite credits mean it’s got very 
little lasting value. 




Okay, so on paper it looks crap - an update of an ancient 
arcade game with weedy graphics and extremely repetitive 
gameplay that involves ceaseless shooting with nary a 
break. But in play it’s absolutely brilliant, a non-stop, 
sweat-squirting, adrenaline gland-popping orgy of 
relentless destruction that reminds you what videogames 
are all about. Top!

The streets of San Francisco have never been more 
dangerous! Racing up the hills and round the twisting 
corners of the city on the bay is entertaining, although the 
control method could stand a lot of improvement. However, 
it’s the hidden depth of SF Rush (you can explore for miles 
off the track to find hidden keys that unlock secrets) that 
keeps it interesting.

A surprisingly 
enjoyable little 
game, which for a 
while supplanted 
Goldeneye as the 
office after-hours 
four-player game of 
choice. Unlike the 17 
million other N64 
snowboarding 
games on the way. 
Snowboard Kids 
plays for laughs, and 
is all the better for it. 
One of the courses 
doesn’t even have 
any snow on it, fer

clean, wholesome 
entertainment.

The N64 ’s very first game, and the one that made people 
take out second mortgages to pay for the then-£250 
console. It’s still a great game even today, though its 
original wow-factor has been diminished enormously by 
everyone else getting aboard the 3-D bandwagon. This 
shouldn’t deter you from buying it, as it’s great (if over- 
cutesy) fun.

Weirdness overload as the bleeping keyring creatures that 
were last year’s fad make it to the N64 in the form of an 
electronic board game. The winner is the first person 
whose Tamagotchi reaches adulthood, helped along by a 
series of subgames. It’s quite good fun, but there is a lot 
of Japanese text, and the subgames aren’t nearly as 
frequent as they should be.

Game Boy puzzler takes place on the surface of a spinning

Top Gear Rally \s 
the most realistic

Surprise number one: THQ came up with an excellent N64 
debut game. Surprise number two: it’s wrestling! WCW Vs 
NWO provides something no other fighting game has 
managed - full*on four player foul play, with loads of 
famous faces from the OTT world of American wrestling. 
Good enough to appeal to non fans of the ‘sport’, which is 
something in itself!

Sans Bradley Walsh (yay!), sans Jenny Powell’s legs and 
cleavage (boo!), this is the American version of the 
gameshow for numbskulls. Although it features the N64’s 
first in-game video footage (hostess Vanna White babbling 
on inanely In a small video window), the questions are far 
too American-oriented and insanely literal for UK players to 
get to grips with.

Now at a new low price, Turok is much better value, though 
in terms of playability it is nowhere near the level of 
Goldeneye. Still, that shouldn’t deter fans of bloody 
slaughter as the titular Indian takes on armies of thugs 
armed with only his trusty bow, arrow and nuclear 
accelerator. If Mario’s sugary antics aren’t for you, Turok’s 
the man. Well, him and Duke.

A sort of 3 -d version of the old Desert Strike games, Seta’s 
whirlybird wig-out offers some short-term fun, but is 
hampered by a fairly limited number of missions and an 
effective but hard-to-learn control method. It also has a 
rather glacial pace, like all-out war in a bowl of half-set 
jelly. As the only game of its type, it might be worth a look 
for frustrated Kilgores.

An exemplary jetski simulation, which laughs so much at 
games like the PlayStation’s Rapid Racer that it vomits over 
them. When it comes to watersports (no, not that sort). 
Wave Race is the only place you should look. There aren’t 
all that many courses to race upon, but those that there are 
are tricky enough to challenge the skills of even the most 
hyped-up gamer.

The first and until recently the only ice hockey game on 
the N64, Wayne Gretzky’s 3-D Hockey won fans because 
of its bone-crunching gameplay and its excellent use of 
the Nintendo analogue controller. Up to four people can 
take part In this top-notch simulation of frosty mayhem - 
the only stumbling block is that nobody over here 
watches ice hockey!

After the dud start of 
FIFA 64, then the 
much-improved FIFA; 
Road To World Cup, 
EA Sports have 
finally hit their stride 
with World Cup ’98. 
The official game of 
the French event, 

WC ’98 is easily on a 
par with Konami’s 
ISS 64 in terms of 
gameplay, so if you 
want to relive/

can at last do it 
without spending 
hours putting in all 
the names.

The sequel to Wayne Gretzky’s 3-D Hockey, and a game 
whose title must have kept the best brains of Midway in the 
States occupied for literally nanoseconds. It maintains the 
same excellent gameplay of its predecessor, but 
unfortunately fails to improve on it in any way. The only 
differences come In updated player stats and teams, so it’s 
one for ice hockey completists only.

An update of Konami’s classic J-League Perfect Striker, 
which gives Japanese players the chance to use the same 
international teams that featured in ISS 64. The 
consensus was that it wasn’t really an improvement over 
either game, though that didn’t stop the Paragon footie 
contingent laying claim to it and a Japanese N64 every 
night after work. 



401 yOSHI'S STORY 



For quite some time. War Gods was used as a benchmark 
for beat-’em-up awfulness. Then along came Clayfighter, 
and suddenly War Gods seemed like Street Fighter in 
comparison. That still doesn’t mean that this clomping, 
inadvertently comedIc testbed for Mortal Kombat4 Is worth 
getting, though. Unless you like fighters who mince about 
like John Inman.

A surprising let-down from Nintendo, perhaps because of 
the minimal involvement of game guru Shigeru Miyamoto. 
Yoshi’s Story is amazing to look at, simple to play... and 
obscenely, laughably easy to complete. The Western 
version has been tweaked very slightly with an extra ending 
for those dedicated enough to complete the game 
collecting only melons, but apart from that it’s the same.

Play As TT 

You’ll need to beat the small clock-like fellow in every race on 
time-trial mode. You’ll know whether you’ve done it because 
you’ll see his ghost as you race, and if you do it he’ll tell you 
to ‘try the next race’. Beat all XT’s times, and you’ll be able to 
play as him! Oh, and it’s not at all easy... 


Turbo Start 

Press and hold the accelerator as the words “Get Ready” fade 
out. If you want a super turbo, which jets you away in a blast 
of blue flame, press the button a fraction of a second before 
the words fade entirely. 


Play As Drumstick 

To access the cartoon characters’ fastest 
racer, you’ll first need to get all the 
amulet pieces from both amulets and the 
four gold trophies. Then return to the 
central area where all the frogs are and 
look for the little green fellow sporting some 
red feathers. Run him over to enable Drumstick.

Destroy The Flag 

When taking part in a flag-tag multiplayer game, if you’re 
using some form of explosive weapons, there is a neat way to 
win the game easily. Get the flag, then after you’ve had 
possession of it for a short time, blow yourself up. The flag 
will be destroyed and thus no-one else will be able to pick it 
up-so you will win! 

Hover Mode 

Activate the Tiny Bond cheat (by completing the Surface 2 
Level in under 4:15 on 00 level), then stand somewhere high 
up, such as at the top of some stairs or a ladder. Crouch down 
to make yourself even lower, and very slowly walk off the high 
area. You’ll find that you don’t move down the stairs, but 
instead walk into space! By moving very slowly, it’s actually 
possible to walk for quite a distance. A good place to try this 
is the Dam Level. Unfortunately you can’t float over obstacles, 
so there’s still no way to reach the mystery complex on the far 
side of the reservoir... 

Hidden Weapons 

On the Train level, blow up the last box at the far end 
of the start room for a hidden RCP-90. 

On the Water Caverns Level, blow up the boxes in the radio 
room. One of the boxes will spew out more boxes. Keep 
blowing them up and eventually you’ll get two assault rifles. 

Kill People During Cut Sequences 

Not so much a cheat, more a fun little aside this. Play 
Goldeneye using the two control pad ‘Domino’ setting, and at 
the end of each level during the animation sequences you’ll 
be able to shoot people using the second pad! This is 
particularly satisfying on levels where you are captured at the 
end, as you can mow down your captors.

Doing this, you’ll be able to unlock the hidden cars and mirror

take more than a day anyway... 

Hidden Route 

The Downtown track has a hidden route, which can massively 
reduce your time and is a lot easier than the normal track. At 
the top of the hill that leads to the waterfall, there is a tree just 
before some fences. Drive through the tree (don’t worry, it 
won’t hurt!) and you’ll be on easy street! 


Quick Start 

Hold down the A button at the beginning of the race when the 
countdown reaches ‘i’. 

Downtown Track Shortcut 


Drive on past the windmills and zig-zags uphill and look for the 
wide turn near the waterfall. There is a tree next to a one way 
sign on the right edge of the track. If you drive towards the 
tree you should find a gap in the fence that will lead you onto 
a dirt road. The road passes through the waterfall into a tunnel 
and you’ll emerge close to the finish line.
