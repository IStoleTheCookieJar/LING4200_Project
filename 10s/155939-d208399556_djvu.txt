4  Lessee  is  hereby  granted  the  right,  at  its  option,  to  pool  or  unitize  any  land  covered  by  this  lease  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this 
lease,  and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease,  or  leases,  as  to  any  or  all  minerals  or  horizons,  so  as  to  establish  units  containing  not  more  than  80 
surface  acres,  plus  1 0%  acreage  tolerance;  provided,  however,  units  may  be  established  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  or  existing  units  may  be 
enlarged  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  so  as  to  contain  not  more  than  640  surface  acres  plus  10%  acreage  tolerance,  if  limited  to  one  or  more 
of  the  following:  (1)  gas,  other  than  casinghead  gas,  (2)  liquid  hydrocarbons  (condensate)  which  are  not  liquids  in  the  subsurface  reservoir,  (3) 
minerals  produced  from  wells  classified  as  gas  wells  by  the  conservation  agency  having  jurisdiction.  If  larger  units  than  any  of  those  herein 
permitted,  either  at  the  time  established,  or  after  enlargement,  are  permitted  or  required  under  any  governmental  rule  or  order,  for  the  dnlling  or 
operation  of  a  well  at  a  regular  location,  or  for  obtaining  maximum  allowable  from  any  well  to  be  drilled,  drilling,  or  already  dnlled,  any  such  unit  may 
be  established  or  enlarged  to  conform  to  the  size  permitted  or  required  by  such  governmental  order  or  rule.  Lessee  shall  exercise  said  option  as 
to  each  desired  unit  by  executing  an  instrument  identifying  such  unit  and  riling  it  for  record  in  the  public  office  in  which  this  lease  is  recorded. 
Such  unit  shall  become  effective  as  of  the  date  provided  for  in  said  instrument  or  instruments  but  If  said  instrument  or  instruments  make  no  such 
provision,  then  such  unit  shall  become  effective  on  the  date  such  instrument  or  instruments  are  so  filed  of  record.  Each  of  said  options  may  be 
exercised  by  Lessee  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  while  this  lease  is  In  force,  and  whether  before  or  after  operations  or  production  has  been 
established  either  on  said  land,  or  on  the  portion  of  said  land  included  in  the  unit,  or  on  other  land  unitized  therewith.  A  unit  established 
hereunder  shall  be  valid  and  effective  for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  even  though  mere  may  be  mineral,  royalty,  or  leasehold  interests  in  lands 
within  the  unit  which  are  not  effectively  pooled  or  unitized.  Any  operations  conducted  on  any  part  of  such  unitized  land  shall  be  considered,  for 
all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of  royalty,  operations  conducted  upon  said  land  under  this  lease.  There  shall  be  allocated  to  the  land  covered 
by  this  lease  within  each  such  unit  (or  to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  proportion 
of  the  total  production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  unit,  after  deducting  any  used  in  lease  or  unit  operations,  which  the  number  of  surface  acres 
in  such  land  (or  In  each  such  separate  tract)  covered  by  this  lease  within  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres  In  the  unit,  and  the 
production  so  allocated  shall  be  considered  for  all  purposes,  including  payment  or  delivery  of  royalty,  overriding  royalty  and  any  other  payments 
out  of  production,  to  be  the  entire  production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  land  to  which  allocated  in  the  same  manner  as  though  produced 
therefrom  under  the  terms  of  this  lease.  The  owner  of  the  reversionary  estate  of  any  term  royalty  or  mineral  estate  agrees  that  the  accrual  of 
royalties  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  or  of  shut-in  royalties  from  a  well  on  the  unit  shall  satisfy  any  limitation  of  term  requiring  production  of  oil  or  gas. 
The  formation  of  any  unit  hereunder  which  includes  land  not  covered  by  this  lease  shall  not  have  the  effect  of  exchanging  or  transfemng  any 
interest  under  this  lease  (including,  without  limitation,  any  shut-in  royalty  which  may  become  payable  under  this  lease)  between  parties  ownng 
interests  in  land  covered  by  this  lease  and  parties  owning  interests  in  land  not  covered  by  this  lease.  Neither  shall  it  impair  the  nght  of  Lessee  to 
release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof,  except  that  Lessee  may  not  so  release  as  to  lands  within  a  unit  while  there  are  operations  thereon  for 
unitized  minerals  unless  all  pooled  leases  are  released  as  to  lands  within  the  unit.  At  any  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force  Lessee  may  dissolve 
any  unit  established  hereunder  by  filing  for  record  in  the  public  office  where  this  lease  is  recorded  a  declaration  to  that  effect,  rf  at  that  time  there 
is  no  unitized  minerals  being  produced  from  such  unit.  Any  unit  formed  may  be  amended,  re-formed,  reduced  or  enlarged  by  Lessee  at  its 
election  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  after  the  orkjinaf  forming  thereof  by  filing  an  appropriate  instrument  of  record  in  the  public  office  In 
which  the  pooled  acreage  is  located.  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  mis  paragraph  4,  a  unit  once  established  hereunder  shaH  remain  in  force  so 
long  as  any  lease  subject  thereto  shall  remain  in  force.  If  mis  lease  now  or  hereafter  covers  separate  tracts,  no  pooling  or  unitization  of  royalty 
interests  as  between  any  such  separate  tracts  is  intended  or  shall  be  implied  or  result  merely  from  the  inclusion  of  such  separate  tracts  within 
this  lease  but  Lessee  snail  nevertheless  have  the  right  to  pool  or  unitize  as  provided  in  mis  paragraph  4  with  consequent  aBocation  of
