NOTES 


ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION This publication presents estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) 2010 
Vineyards collection. Included are statistics on the area and production of wine grapes 
and summary information by wine grape variety. The publication presents data for 
Australia and states and territories, with sub-state data based on Geograpical Indication 
(GD Zones provided in an attached data cube. An additional data cube providing 


information on watering sources and methods is also provided. 


Additional wine and grape industry data will be published in Australian Wine and Grape 
Industry (cat. no. 1329.0) and in Agricultural Commodities, Australia, 2009-10 (cat. no. 
7121.0). 


The Vineyards collection excludes table, drying and other grapes. 


CHANGES IN THIS ISSUE The 2010 Vineyards collection was a census of all in-scope vineyards and collected 
information on a wide range of wine grape varieties. This is in contrast to the 2009 
vineyards collection, which was undertaken using a survey methodology and collected 
information on the major wine grape varieties only. The 2010 Vineyards collection also 
included additional questions related to watering sources and methods. Associated data 


are available in an attached data cube. 


For further information on the scope and content of 2010 Vineyards collection please 


refer to the Explanatory Notes.

INTRODUCTION Estimates from the 2010 Vineyards collection indicate that total wine grape production 


was down 9% from 2009. 


AREA OF VINES Wine grape growers cultivated 157 thousand hectares of vines for the 2010 season. The 
total bearing area for wine grapes was 152 thousand hectares, while the area not yet 
bearing was 4.8 thousand hectares. Red wine grape varieties comprised 61% of the total 


area of vines and 61% of the total bearing area. 


GRAPE PRODUCTION Total wine grape production in 2010 was 1.5 million tonnes, a decrease from 
1.7 million tonnes the previous year. South Australia remained the largest producing 
state with 731 thousand tonnes. New South Wales was the next largest producing state 


with 443 thousand tonnes, followed by Victoria with 284 thousand tonnes. 


Red wine grape production (845 thousand tonnes) was higher than white wine grape 
production (688 thousand tonnes). The highest red wine grape production was in South 
Australia with 57% (482 thousand tonnes) of total red wine grapes produced. The 
highest white wine grape production was in New South Wales with 36% 

(250 thousand tonnes) of total white wine grapes produced, closely followed by South 


Australia with 248 thousand tonnes. 


Three varieties of grapes accounted for 60% of all wine grape production: shiraz 
(403 thousand tonnes), chardonnay (298 thousand tonnes) and cabernet sauvignon 
(214 thousand tonnes). Shiraz accounted for 48% of all red wine grape production in 
2010, compared to 44% in 2009. Chardonnay accounted for 43% of all white wine 
production in 2010, compared to 48% in 2009.

INTRODUCTION 1 This publication presents estimates from the ABS Vineyards collection, 2010. 


2. The Vineyards collection is run on behalf of the Grape and Wine Research and 
Development Corporation (GWRDC). It is designed to collect varietal information on all 
significant grape varieties grown and provide information about grape growing and 
production for wine-making, including areas watered, and volume and sources of water 
used. The main user of this information is the Australian wine industry's Statistics 
Working Group (SWG), which is made up of representatives of industry peak bodies and 
represents the views of the industry on statistical matters. 


SCOPE AND COVERAGE 3 Incontrast to the 2009 Vineyards collection, the 2010 Vineyards collection was a 
census of all in-scope vineyards. Estimates of area, production and yield are presented in 
the publication for Australia and states and territories, and are available for sub-state 
regions in the attached data cubes. The sub-state regions are based on Australian 
Geographical Indication (GI) zones. State and territory data on watering sources and 
methods are also available in an attached data cube. 


4 Australian Geographical Indication (GI) Zones are official descriptions of Australian 
wine zones as defined in the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. For 

more detail on Australian Geographical Indication (GI) Zones, see the Australian Wine 

and Brandy Corporation website, http://wineaustralia.com/australia 


5 The scope of the 2010 Vineyards collection was agricultural businesses recorded on 
the ABS' Business Register (ABSBR) above a minimum size cut-off. The ABSBR is based 
on the Australian Business Register (ABR) which is administered and maintained by the 
Australian Taxation Office (ATO). 


6 Aminimum size cut-off of $5,000 was applied to determine whether a business was 
in-scope for the 2010 Vineyards collection, as well as being identified on the ABSBR as a 
wine grape grower/vineyard through survey feedback or from Australian and New 
Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) information. The measure of size was 
based on either the ABS' Estimated Value of Agricultural Operations (EVAO) or a derived 
value based on Business Activity Statement (BAS) turnover. 


7 While the ABSBR does not include all agricultural businesses in Australia, it provides 
improved coverage from the previous ABS-maintained Agricultural Survey frame, since 
most businesses and organisations in Australia need to obtain an Australian Business 
Number (ABN) from the ATO for their business operations. The ABR-based register also 
provides more up-to-date coverage as it excludes agricultural businesses with cancelled 
ABNs and incorporates regularly updated information on agricultural businesses from 
the ATO. 


8 Viticulture statistics relate to the year in which the harvest occurred and are derived 
from information obtained in a collection of all known growers. Data quality is 
continually being improved through advancements in coverage. 


GENERAL 9 The statistics in this publication are the final Vineyards estimates for 2009-10. No 
preliminary data were released for the 2010 Vineyards collection. 


10 Where figures have been rounded, discrepancies may occur between sums of the 


component items and totals

GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT 12 ABS publications draw extensively on information provided freely by individuals, 
businesses, governments and other organisations. Their continued cooperation is very 
much appreciated. Without it, the wide range of statistics published by the ABS would 
not be available. Information received by the ABS is treated in strict confidence as 
required by the Census and Statistics Act 1905. 


RELATED PUBLICATIONS 13 A range of publications relevant to the Agriculture sector are produced by the ABS, 
including: 
a Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (cat. no. 1292.0)
