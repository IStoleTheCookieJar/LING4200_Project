Agency  Shapes  Policies  to  Support  the  Global  Trade  Arena 


By  Gabrielle  Canonico,  PPD,  and  Beth  Jones,  LPA 


There  is  a  new  environment 
forming  in  APHIS.  It's  being 
shaped  by  the  effect  our  sanitary 
and  phytosanitary  (SPS)  responsi¬ 
bilities  are  having  on  trade. 

In  the  post-General  Agreements 
on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT)  era, 
the  demands  facing  APHIS  have 
changed  dramatically.  The  volume 
and  complexity  of  SPS  issues 
surrounding  trade  and  the 
workload  associated  with  regulat¬ 
ing  imports  and  facilitating 
exports  are  increasing  by  leaps 
and  bounds. 


APHIS  strives  to  balance  carefully 
its  responsibilities  to  safeguard 
America’s  agricultural  resources 
with  its  efforts  to  facilitate  U.S. 
agricultural  exports.  Through  its 
visioning  process,  APHIS  adopted  a 
global  interests  vision  element 
that  says,  “APHIS  facilitates  trade, 
technology  transfer,  and  move¬ 
ment  of  international  passengers 
and  commodities.  We  develop 
biologically  sound  pest  and  disease 
exclusion  programs  and  promote 
international  standards  and 
globally  recognized  certification

systems.  We  anticipate  worldwide 
trends  and  develop  strategic  trade 
policies  that  promote  U.S.:  eco¬ 
nomic  advantage  in  the  global 
marketplace." 

So,  even  though  APHIS Js  known 
more  for  its  protection  efforts,  it 
supports  the  Department’s  long¬ 
term  strategy  of  doubling  U.S. 
agricultural  exports  by  the  year 
2000.  However,  to  reach  this  goal, 
the  United  States  must  actively 
address  and  resolve  unjustified 
barriers  that  are  constraining  U.S. 
trade.  A  1995  USDA  study  esti¬ 
mated  that  the  total  value  of  U.S. 
agricultural  trade  that  is  con¬ 
strained  by  technical  barriers  is 
about  $4.7  billion.  Because  the 
scientific  expertise  to  address 
many  of  these  technical  SPS 
issues  resides  in  part  in  APHIS, 
the  agency  has  a  compelling

interest  in  taking  steps  to  ensure 
growth  as  well  as  safety  in  world 
agricultural  trade. 

It’s  no  wonder  that  with  all 
these  evolving  changes  in  the 
global  marketplace,  APHIS  is 
searching  to  define  its  identity 
with  regard  to  international  trade. 
APHIS’  challenge  lies  in  being  able 
to  encourage  a  “culture  change” 
both  internally  and  externally  to 
modify  existing  perceptions  and 
build  the  support  and  cooperation 
necessary  to  be  effective  in  ad¬ 
dressing  all  SPS  issues  in  the 
trade  arena. 

Right  now,  for  instance,  agency 
programs  are  for  the  most  part 
handling  SPS  issues  indepen¬ 
dently.  Plant  Protection  and 
Quarantine’s  (PPQ)  Issues  Man¬ 
agement  Team,  International 
Services’  Trade  Support  Team,  and 
PPQ  and  Veterinary  Services’ 
import  and  export  staffs  are  all 
involved  with  SPS  issues. 

These  entities  all  share  the 
same  goal  with  regard  to  interna¬ 
tional  trade:  to  protect  American 
agriculture  by  ensuring  safety  and 
fairness  in  U.S.  agricultural  trade 
relations  with  other  countries. 
APHIS  will  accomplish  this  goal  by 
applying  equivalent,  science-based 
standards  of  protection  to  and  for 
agricultural  commodies  based  on 
international  standards,  risk 
analysis,  and  the  use  of  innovative 
risk  management  strategies. 

A  primary  principle  of  both  GATT 
and  the  North  American  Free  Trade 
Agreement  is  that  each  country 
has  the  sovereign  right  to  determine 
its  appropriate  level  of  protection. 
The  most  significant  difference  for 
APHIS  in  this  new  environment  is 
that  our  plant  and  animal  import 
requirements  must  conform  with 
internationally  accepted  standards 
and  be  based  on  scientific  principles 
and  evidence. 

Trade  Strategy  Retreat 

How  APHIS  will  ultimately 
adapt  to  and  function  in  the  new 
trade  environment  is  still  open  for 
debate.  Over  the  past  several 
months,  the  APHIS  vision’s  Global 
Interests  Group  (GIG)  and  other 
teams  involved  in  SPS-related 
activities  held  a  series  of  meetings 
to  decide  whether  APHIS  in  fact 
has  a  unified  trade  policy  in  place 
and,  if  so,  to  define  it.  The  result 
was  a  trade  strategy  retreat  in 
August.  About  40  employees 
representing  all  sectors  of  the 


agency  met  to  formulate  a  coherent 
trade  strategy  and  to  identify  and 
prioritize  the  key  actions  APHIS 
would  have  to  take  to  implement 
this  strategy. 

Participants  reviewed  four  basic 
inter-related  areas  of  activity  that 
support  APHIS’  goal  of  trade 
facilitation:  international  stan¬ 
dard-setting  activities,  bilateral 
negotiations.  World  Trade  Organi¬ 
zation  (WTO)  compliance/imple¬ 
mentation  and  multilateral  affairs, 
and  risk  analysis.  Using  these  four 
basic  areas,  participants  prepared 
action  plans  to  support  the  imple¬ 
mentation  of  the  APHIS  SPS  trade 
strategy.  Participants  also  identi¬ 
fied  the  following  nine  desired 
results  of  APHIS’  activities  in 
international  trade: 

1.  Contribute  to  the  Departmental 
trade  goal  of  doubling  U.S.  agricul¬ 
tural  exports  by  the  year  2000. 

2.  Establish  and  maintain  leader¬ 
ship  in  the  elaboration  and  imple¬ 
mentation  of  SPS  principles  with 
regard  to  plant  and  animal  health. 

3.  Coordinate  trade-related 
activities  and  strategically  manage 
the  workload  associated  with 
expansions  in  trade  and  compli¬ 
ance  with  SPS. 

4.  Observe  the  “golden  rule”  of 
trade  by  applying  equivalent 
standards  of  protection  to  imports 
and  exports  to  ensure  safety  and 
fairness  in  our  trade  relations 
with  other  countries. 

5.  Establish  and  maintain  a 


reputation  for  results-oriented,  fair, 
and  technically  sound  negotiation. 

6.  Maintain  transparent  and 
efficient  risk  analysis  systems  to 
ensure  a  technical  and  scientific 
basis  for  decisionmaking  and  the 
development  of  Agency  positions. 

7.  Comply  with  international 
standards.  Challenge  and  improve 
standards  that  we  believe  are 
inadequate.  Propose  standards 
where  none  exist. 

8.  Be  active  in  standard -setting 
organizations.  Develop  and  strate¬ 
gically  influence  international 
standard-setting  processes,

Agency  Says  'Goodbye'  to  Two  on  the  Top  Management  Team 


Two  Deputy  Administrators 
have  recently  left  APHIS,  opting  for 
retirement.  PPQ  Deputy  Adminis¬ 
trator  Don  Husnik  left  the  agency 
at  the  end  of  August,  and  AC 
Deputy  Administrator  Dale 
Schwindaman  followed  on  the  first 
of  November.  Both  men  served 
APHIS  long  and  well  and  leave 
behind  impressive  records. 

Don  Husnik 

Retire¬ 
ment  for 
Husnik 
has  meant 
a  return  to 
his  Minne¬ 
sota  roots. 

Right  out 
of  college 
(Univer¬ 
sity  of 
Minne¬ 
sota), 

Husnik  worked  as  a  plant  quaran¬ 
tine  officer  in  Detroit,  MI.  In  1969 
he  went  to  Anchorage,  AK,  to  serve 
as  officer  in  charge  there.  In  1974, 

including  consensus  building 
around  U.S.  positions. 

9.  Ensure  that  the  agency  has 
enough  employees  with  the  skills, 
abilities,  experience,  and  technical 
competence  to  handle  interna¬ 
tional  trade  issues  with  confidence 
and  authority. 

How  to  Achieve  Results 

Next,  the  participants  identified 
actions  needed  to  achieve  the  results 
mentioned  above.  Actions  were 
categorized  into  five  focus  areas. 

1)  SPS  Activities  and  Trade 
Coordination — providing  leadership 
and  support  for  all  trade-related 
activities  in  APHIS  and  establish¬ 
ing  teams  to  develop  prioritization 
criteria  for  positions,  agendas,  and 
allocation  of  resources. 

2)  Systems  Design — developing 
internal  processes  that  will  facili¬ 
tate  efficient  delivery  of  APHIS  trade- 
related  products  and  services  and 
obtaining  agreement  on  international 
standards  and  systems  for  imple¬ 
menting  a  harmonized  approach  to 
infrastructure  building,  risk  analysis, 
regionalization,  and  surveillance 
and  monitoring  systems. 

3)  Compliance  Review — ensur¬ 
ing  APHIS’  regulations,  policies. 


he  moved  to  San  Francisco,  CA,  as 
assistant  district  director. 

The  first  move  to  Washington, 
DC,  came  in  1977,  where  he  was  a 
special  assistant  to  the  PPQ  deputy 
administrator.  In  1980  he  accepted 
a  promotion  as  regional  director  of 
PPQ’s  Southeastern  Region  in 
Gulfport,  MS.  Returning  to  Wash¬ 
ington  in  1984,  Husnik  served  as 
assistant  deputy  administrator  for 
national  programs  and  associate 
deputy  administrator  for  PPQ. 

In  the  1988  reorganization  of 
APHIS,  Husnik  was  selected  as 
director  of  a  new  unit — PPD — and 
served  in  that  position  until 
September  1991  when  he  became 
acting  deputy  administrator  for 
M&B.  In  1992  Husnik  moved  again 
to  Moorestown,  NJ,  to  be  PPQ’s 
Northeastern  Regional  director 
and  remained  there  until  he  was 
called  to  Washington  one  last  time 
to  become  deputy  administrator  of 
PPQ  in  1995. 

Although  Husnik  spent  his 
entire  professional  life  with  APHIS 
(or  APHIS  predecessors),  within 


programs,  and  techniques  are  in 
compliance  with  WTO /SPS  prin¬ 
ciples  and  international  standards. 

4) Capacity  Building — education, 
training,  and  professional  develop¬ 
ment  of  employees,  stakeholders, 
and  trading  partners  to  ensure 
national  and  international  compli¬ 
ance  with  SPS  principles  and  the 
continuity  and  success  of  APHIS 
representation  in  negotiations  and 
international  standard  setting 
meetings. 

5)  Information  Systems — 
establishing  and  using  electronic 
systems  as  a  means  of  sharing 
information,  soliciting  reviews, 
and  communicating  on  the  status 
of  current  issues  and  relevant 
trade  information. 

These  actions  and  the  criteria 
for  trade  coordination  identified  by 
the  Global  Interest  Group  are 
being  reviewed  by  a  small  team  of 
trade  retreat  participants  repre¬ 
senting  key  program  areas.  By 
the  end  of  the  year,  this  group  will 
offer  recommendations  on  how 
APHIS  can  best  coordinate  its  SPS 
activities  and  specifically  imple¬ 
ment  the  action  items  that 
emerged  from  the  trade  retreat.  ♦ 


the  agency  his  varied  career 
included  stints  as  head  of  three 
different  units  at  different  times. 
With  so  much  moving  around,  it  is 
no  wonder  that  on  retirement,  he 
headed  back  to  Minnesota  where 
he  bought  a  house  in  Birchwood. 

“He  told  me  his  main  responsi¬ 
bility  now  is  to  clean  the  snow  out 
of  the  driveway  and  warm  up  the 
car  so  his  wife  Marilyn  can  go  to 
work,”  says  Acting  PPQ  Deputy 
Administrator  A1  Elder.  “Other 
than  that,  I  believe  Don  just  plans 
to  relax  and  pursue  whatever 
strikes  his  fancy!”

part  of  an  organization  that  follows 
the  highest  standards  of  Govern¬ 
ment  service,”  says  Schwindaman 
of  his  years  with  APHIS.  “Working 
for  VS  in  animal  disease  control 
and  later  for  REAC  in  regulatory 
enforcement  and  in  the  emerging 
field  of  animal  welfare  regulation

USDA  Agencies  Hold  First 
Meeting  on  Trade  Strategy 

USDA  agency  representatives 
met  for  the  first  time  last  month 
to  discuss  working  together  in 
the  global  marketplace  to 
facilitate  trade.  Representatives 
from  APHIS,  the  Agricultural 
Marketing  Service,  the  Grain 
Inspection,  Packers  and  Stock- 
yard  Administration,  the  Eco¬ 
nomic  Research  Service,  the 
Foreign  Agricultural  Service, 
and  the  Food  Safety  and  Inspection 
Service  are  planning  on  meeting 
the  first  Wednesday  of  every 
month  to  discuss  how  agencies 
can  match  priorities  for  regions, 
countries,  and  commodities. 

Also  on  the  agenda  will  be 
issues  from  bilateral  negotia¬ 
tions  and  initiatives  from 
international  standard-setting 
organizations.  Finally,  the  group 
will  address  transparency  issues 
and  educational  needs  that  surface

Cooperating  Officials  Declare  Honduras  Free  of  the  Screwworm 

By  Jim  Novy,  IS,  Honduras 


Carl  Castelton,  IS  associate  deputy  administrator,  signs  the 
official  declaration  of  eradication  of  screwworm  from  Honduras. 
Looking  on  at  his  left  is  the  president  of  the  National  Federation  of 
Agriculturalists  and  Livestock  Owners.  On  Castelton’s  right  are 
U.S.  Ambassador  to  Honduras  and  Presidential  Designate  of 
Honduras  Guadalupe  Jerezano. 


On  August  6,  1996,  President 
Designate  Guadalupe  Jerezano 
declared  the  Republic  of  Honduras 
officially  free  of  the  screwworm  at 
a  ceremony  in  Tegucigalpa, 
Honduras. 

It  was  a  feat  worth  celebrating. 
In  less  than  5  years,  the  screw¬ 
worm,  an  insidious  insect  pest  that 
attacks  any  warm-blooded  ani¬ 
mal — domestic,  wild,  or  human — 
had  been  totally  eliminated  from 
the  Republic  of  Honduras.  (An  ani¬ 
mal  whose  infested  wounds  are  not 
treated  can  die  in  7  to  10  days.) 

Through  a  Cooperative  Program 
between  the  Secretariat  of  Natural 
Resources  of  Honduras  and  APHIS, 
nearly  $46  million  was  spent  to 
eradicate  this  costly  pest. 

Other  officials  both  from  the 
United  States  and  from  the  Hon¬ 
duran  government  attended  the 
ceremony,  marking  the  important 
event  with  speeches.  The  Minister 
of  Natural  Resources,  Ricardo 
Arias  Brito,  and  the  President  of 
the  National  Federation  of  Agricul¬ 
turalists  and  Livestock  Owners  of 
Honduras,  Pedro  Arturo  Sevilla, 
mentioned  the  positive  economic 
benefits  of  the  eradication  of  the 
screwworm  from  Honduras  and 
the  successful  conclusion  of  the 
Cooperative  Program. 

Comments  on  the  successful 
binational  program  and  congratu¬ 
latory  remarks  were  made  by  the 
U.S.  Ambassador  to  Honduras, 
William  Piyce.  Representing 
Assistant  Secretary  Michael  Dunn, 
the  agricultural  attache  in  Guate¬ 
mala  delivered  a  speech  expressing 
the  international  cooperation  demon¬ 
strated  in  the  eradication  of  screw- 
worms  and  the  great  benefits  that 
have  resulted  for  the  entire  region, 
as  well  as  for  the  United  States. 

Representing  APHIS,  IS  Associ¬ 
ate  Deputy  Administrator  Carl 
Castleton  presented  plaques  from 
USDA  in  recognition  of  those 
individuals  who  contributed  to  the 
leadership  of  the  successful 
eradication  of  the  screwworm  from 
Honduras.  Welcoming  speeches 
were  given  by  the  Secretariat  of 
Natural  Resources’  Director  of  the 
Cooperative  Program,  Guillermo 


Cruz,  and  by  me  as  the  U.S.  Direc¬ 
tor  of  the  Cooperative  Program. 

Strategy  from  the  '40's 

This  celebration  and  the  eradi¬ 
cation  effort  is  part  of  a  USDA 
strategy  that  goes  back  many 
years.  If  it  is  possible  to  eradicate 
economically  devastating  diseases 
from  a  wide  geographic  area,  the 
threat  of  those  diseases  being 
introduced  into  our  country  is 
greatly  reduced,  even  negligible. 
This  strategy  was  adopted  for 
several  diseases  (the  fever  tick  and 
foot-and-mouth  disease)  that 
threatened  to  cross  our  borders 
from  the  Caribbean  and  Latin 
America  and  threaten  our  agricul¬ 
ture.  Adoption  of  this  strategy  to 
the  screwworm  became  possible 
with  the  development  of  sterile 
insect  technology  by  two  Agricul¬ 
tural  Research  Service  scientists 
after  World  War  II.  The  technology 
was  used  to  eradicate  the  screw¬ 
worm  from  the  United  States, 
Mexico,  Belize,  Guatemala,  and  El 
Salvador  (see  the  sidebar). 

The  Eradication  technology  we 
used  in  Honduras  is  the  same, 
with  some  modifications.  This 
technology  utilizes  the  mass 
production  of  the  screwworm  on 


an  artificial  diet  with  a  controlled 
environment  in  a  biologically 
secure  facility. 

The  facility  we  used  is  located 
near  Tuxtla  Gutierrez,  Chiapas, 
Mexico.  The  insects  are  exposed  to 
radiation  while  in  the  pupa  stage 
of  development.  The  radiation 
treatment  renders  them  sexually 
sterile  without  any  other  effect. 

The  sexually  sterile  flies  are 
then  distributed  over  the  eradica¬ 
tion  area  each  week  from  slow, 
low-flying  airplanes.  When  a 
sterile  male  mates  with  a  native 
female  screwworm  fly,  no  larvae 
are  produced,  and  the  life  cycle  is 
thus  broken. 

Continual  treatment  of  an  area 
usually  results  in  eradication  of 
the  species  in  less  than  2  years.  In 
Honduras,  more  than  1 1  billion 
sterile  screwworm  flies  were 
dispersed  over  the  country  during 
the  brief  history  of  the  program. 
Airplanes  distributing  these 
insects  flew  a  total  of  15,300 
hours.  To  handle  the  sterile  flies, 
environmental  chambers  were 
installed  at  Toncontin  Intema-

The  Last  Case 

The  last  animal  to  be 
found  with  screwworms 
in  Honduras  was  near 
the  Rio  Patuca  in  the 
Municipio  of  Froylan 
Turcios  in  the  Depart¬ 
ment  (state)  of  Olancho 
on  January  10,  1995. 

More  than  100  coopera¬ 
tive  program  field  inspec¬ 
tors,  several  thousand 
volunteers  known  as 
honorary  inspectors,  who 
help  the  program  without 
pay,  and  animal  owners  have 
continued  surveillance  of  animals 
throughout  the  country.  By  report¬ 
ing  suspicious  cases  of  the  screw- 
worm,  they  have  helped  verify  that 
the  country  is  free  of  the  pest. 

Estimated  economic  losses  to 
the  livestock  industry  from  screw- 
worms  in  Honduras  were  about 
$15  million  annually  according  to 


an  economic  study  conducted  by 
Texas  A&M  University.  Costs  to 
livestock  producers  resulted  from 
insecticide  purchases  for  wound 
treatment,  labor  to  care  for  the 
animals,  loss  of  production,  and 
loss  of  animals. 

Animals  entering  Honduras 
from  Nicaragua  and  other  countries 
to  the  south  are  inspected,  and 


their  wounds  are 
treated  as  a  precau¬ 
tion  to  prevent  the 
reintroduction  of  the 
screwworm. 

Eradication  of  the 
screwworm  began  in 
Nicaragua  in  1993, 
and  most  of  the 
country  is  now  free. 
The  ultimate  goal  is 
to  eliminate  the 
screwworm  from  all 
regions  north  of  the 
Isthmus  of  Panama 
and  to  maintain  a 
permanent  barrier  at 
that  location. 

With  the  finaliza¬ 
tion  of  the  activities  of  the  Coop¬ 
erative  Program,  the  responsibility 
for  continued  surveillance  and 
prevention  of  reintroduction  of  the 
pest  passes  to  the  Secretariat  of 
Natural  Resources.  And  I,  the

eradication  program,  am  looking 
for  another  job!  ♦

all  levels  in 
the  Depart¬ 
ment.” 

When 

asked  what 
he  felt  was 
his  most 
meaningful 
contribution 
to  APHIS,  Schwindaman  said,  “I 
have  devoted  a  good  part  of  my 
career  to  animal  welfare  regula¬ 
tion,  which  has  always  been  a 
center  for  controversy.  In  imple¬ 
menting  the  legislation,  I  have 
tried  to  respect  the  different  points 
of  view  of  the  people  involved  and 
to  treat  them  with  equity  and 
honesty.  And,  in  the  final  analy¬ 
sis,  I  have  tried  to  remember  that 
it  is  the  welfare  of  the  animals 
that  is  at  the  heart  of  the  intent  of 


the  people  through  their  legisla¬ 
tors.  It  is  the  animals’  welfare  we 
are  trying  to  improve  within  a 
democratic  process." 

Schwindaman  was  bom  and 
raised  on  a  farm  in  Kansas.  He 
credits  the  USDA  county  home- 
demonstration  agent  with  encour¬ 
aging  his  ambition  to  become  a 
veterinarian.  In  1953  he  received 
both  bachelor  of  science  and 
doctor  of  veterinaiy  medicine 
degrees  from  Kansas  State  Univer¬ 
sity.  While  stationed  in  Delaware, 
Schwindaman  completed  academic 
work  toward  a  Master  of  Science 
in  Animal  Science  at  the  Univer¬ 
sity  of  Delaware. 

After  graduation  from  veterinary 
school,  Schwindaman  practiced  in 
Wisconsin  until  he  was  called  to 
military  duty  in  the  Air  Force 
Veterinary  Corps.  After  leaving 
active  duty,  he  worked  as  a  field 
veterinarian  with  the  Minnesota 
Livestock  Sanitary  Board  during 
the  accelerated  brucellosis  eradi¬ 
cation  program. 

In  1957,  Schwindaman  began 
his  service  with  USDA  as  a  Dis¬ 
trict  Veterianrian  in  Michigan.  He 
later  served  as  Area  Veterinarian 


in  Illinois,  assistant  veterinarian- 
in-charge  in  New  Jersey,  and 
veterinarian -in- charge  in  Dela¬ 
ware.  In  1966  he  was  transferred 
to  the  newly-formed  Animal 
Welfare  Staff  of  the  Animal  Health 
Division  in  Hyattsville,  where  he 
was  instrumental  in  writing  the 
standards  and  regulations  that 
implemented  the  new  Animal 
Welfare  Act.  In  1975,  he  was 
named  to  head  that  staff.  Other 
assignments  included  chief  staff 
veterinarian  of  the  Domestic 
Programs  Support  Staff,  chief  staff 
veterinarian  for  Technical  Assess¬ 
ment,  and  Assistant  Deputy 
Administrator  of  REAC.  In  1989, 
he  became  the  regional  director  of 
the  Western  States  for  VS,  and  in 
1992  returned  to  Maryland  as 
REAC's  Deputy  Administrator. 

Asked  about  his  plans  after 
retirement,  Schwindaman  replied, 
“I  plan  to  travel  and  to  spend  more 
time  with  my  family  in  Rockville, 
MD.  But  I  also  hope  to  remain 
active  in  the  field  of  animal 
welfare  regulation  as  a  consultant 
and  mediator  and  to  do  some 
writing."  ♦

Inside  APHIS/5 


Working  Group  Keeps  on  Top  of  Degenerative  Cattle  Disease 


By  Dawn  Kent,  Public  Affairs,  LPA 

Much  of  the  American  public 
had  never  heard  of  bovine 
spongiform  encephalopathy  (BSE) 
until  the  “mad  cow  scare”  hap¬ 
pened  in  the  United  Kingdom  this 
past  March.  Then  the  nightly  news 
was  flooded  with  clips  of  British 
officials  admitting  a  possible  link 
between  BSE  and  a  variant  form  of 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease  (CJD),  a 
deadly  human  equivalent.  A  public 
health  nightmare  ensued,  and  the 
media  had  a  field  day.  Television 
news  magazines  and  talk  shows 
covered  every  aspect  of  the  out¬ 
break — the  crash  of  the  British 
beef  market,  dramatic  interviews 
with  families  of  CJD  victims,  the 
European  Union’s  worldwide  ban 
on  British  beef,  and  whether  it 
was  safe  to  eat  a  McDonald’s  Big 
Mac.  The  epidemic  even  spurred 
Oprah  Winfrey  to  spend  an  hour 
questioning  the  safety  of  the  U.S. 
food  supply. 

For  APHIS,  however,  BSE  was 
not  startling  news.  APHIS  has  been 
aware  of  BSE  in  the  United 
Kingdom  since  1986  when  the  first 
case  of  the  disease  was  reported  in 
that  country.  In  fact,  APHIS  has  a 
committee  that  has  monitored  the 
development  of  BSE  to  ensure  that 
this  serious  disease  does  not  become 
established  in  the  United  States. 

For  those  who  missed  the  media 
coverage,  BSE  is  a  chronic  degen¬ 
erative  disease  affecting  the 
central  nervous  system  of  cattle. 
Following  the  onset  of  clinical 
signs,  such  as  abnormal  posture, 
incoordination  and  difficulty  in 
rising,  and  loss  of  body  weight,  the 
animal’s  condition  deteriorates 
until  it  either  dies  or  is  destroyed. 
Little  is  known  about  BSE — there 
is  neither  treatment  nor  vaccine  to 
prevent  the  disease:  nor  is  there  a 
valid  diagnostic  test  to  detect  the 
disease  in  a  live  animal. 

As  the  incidence  of  BSE  in¬ 
creased  in  the  United  Kingdom, 
and  as  other  parts  of  Europe 
began  reporting  BSE  cases.  APHIS 
adopted  a  more  vigorous  response. 
In  July  1989,  we  banned  the 
importation  of  all  live  ruminants. 
We  later  banned  most  bovine 
byproducts  and  placed  restrictions 
on  meat  imports  from  the  United 
Kingdom  and  other  countries 
where  BSE  exists.  Research  and 
educational  efforts  continued  in 


the  United  States,  and  in  May 
1990,  APHIS  created  the  BSE 
Issues  Management  Committee 
and  initiated  the  BSE  surveillance 
program. 

Similar  Diseases 

BSE  is  one  in  a  group  of  similar 
diseases  known  as  transmissible 
spongiform  encephalopathies 
(TSEs).  Other  types  of  TSE’s 
include  scrapie,  which  affects 
sheep  and  goats:  transmissible 
mink  encephalopathy:  feline 
spongiform  encephalopathy;  chronic 
wasting  disease  of  deer  and  elk; 
and  kuru,  CJD,  Gerstmann- 
Straussler-Schneinker  syndrome, 
and  fatal  familial  insomnia,  four 
rare  diseases  in  humans.  Because 
of  the  interrelated  nature  of  these 
diseases,  APHIS  decided  that  BSE 
could  not  be  a  category  of  its  own. 
Therefore,  the  committee  is  now 
known  as  the  TSE  Working  Group. 

"We're  working 
diligently  to  make 
sure  that  the 
United  States 
avoids  the  same 
chain  of  events 
that  happened  in  the 
United  Kingdom." 

— Linda  Detwiler 


In  recognition  of  the  unusual 
nature  of  the  policy  issues  posed 
by  BSE,  the  TSE  Working  Group 
was  established  as  an  advisory 
committee  to  APHIS  management 
on  all  aspects  of  BSE  policy.  For 
most  policy  issues,  the  TSE 
Working  Group  determined  a  range 
of  reasonable  options  and  pre¬ 
sented  both  advantages  and 
disadvantages  surrounding  each. 
Using  this  approach,  the  group 
acted  as  a  springboard  for  further 
discussions  between  agency 
colleagues,  other  Federal  agencies, 
the  livestock  and  poultry  indus¬ 
tries,  and  the  general  public. 


After  its  first  meeting  on  June 
6,  1990,  the  TSE  Working  Group 
met  weekly  to  develop  a  briefing 
report.  The  final  report,  presented 
in  February  1991,  detailed  APHIS’ 
response  to  BSE  in  the  United 
Kingdom  and  introduced  a  variety 
of  policy  options  regarding  BSE. 

The  report  analyzed  contingency 
plans  for  APHIS’  response  if  BSE 
were  to  occur  in  the  United  States. 
APHIS  again  called  upon  the  TSE 
Working  Group  in  1994  to  com¬ 
plete  a  BSE  update  report,  which 
was  finalized  in  February  1996. 

When  news  spread  this  year  of 
the  BSE  outbreak  in  the  United 
Kingdom,  the  TSE  Working  Group’s 
preparation  and  planning  was  put 
to  good  use.  The  group’s  responsi¬ 
bilities  are  even  more  significant 
today  than  they  were  when  the 
group  was  formed.  Chaired  by 
Linda  Detwiler.  the  area  veterinar¬ 
ian  in  charge  in  New  Jersey,  the 
group,  using  science  as  the  focal 
point  in  policy  planning  and  issues 
management,  now  serves  as  a 
scientific  resource  for  APHIS. 

“This  working  group  is  like  an 
advisory  committee,"  says 
Detwiler.  “We  provide  APHIS 
decisionmakers  with  policy  recom¬ 
mendations  based  on  current 
science  and  keep  them  updated  on 
the  latest  BSE  research  findings. 
We  also  act  as  a  technical  re¬ 
source,  answering  questions  from 
State  and  Federal  employees  and 
the  general  public." 

In  addition  to  Detwiler,  the  TSE 
Working  Group  consists  of  1 1 
members:  VS  members  in 
Riverdale,  MD,  are  Sara  Kaman 
and  Lisa  Ferguson  of  the  National 
Center  for  Import  and  Export:  Dan 
Harpster  from  the  National  Animal 
Health  Program:  and  Roberta 
Duhaime  and  Dianna  Herbert  of 
Emergency  Programs.  Other  VS 
members  are  Bruce  Wagner  and 
Kevin  Walker  at  the  Centers  for 
Epidemiology  and  Animal  Health 
at  Fort  Collins,  CO;  Tom  Gomez  of 
the  Centers  for  Disease  Control 
and  Prevention  (CDC)  in  Atlanta, 
GA;  A1  Jenny  of  the  National 
Veterinary  Sendees  Laboratories 
in  Ames,  LA:  Kathleen  Akin  of 
Lincoln,  NE;  and  Gary  Svetlik  of 
Georgetown,  TX.  Other  members 
are  Bill  White,  IS,  and  Dawn  Kent, 
LPA,  both  in  Riverdale,  MD.

Roma  PPQ  Office  Uses  a  One-APHIS  Approach  on  the  Border 


A  stretch  of  the  Rio  Grande 
River  winds  through  southeastern 
Texas  from  Los  Ebanos  (west  of 
Mission)  to  Zapata,  about  50  miles 
southeast  of  Laredo.  This  part  of 
the  U.S. -Mexican  border  covers 
about  80  miles  as  the  crow  flies 
but  120  miles  following  the 
twistings  and  turnings  of  the  river. 
For  the  past  several  years,  Jerry 
Akin  and  David  Villarreal,  the  PPQ 
officers  assigned  to  the  Roma,  Rio 
Grande  City,  and  Falcon  Station 
ports  of  entry,  have  used  public 
awareness  and  interagency 
cooperation  to  develop  a  proactive 
program  to  help  stop  agricultural 
contraband .  (See  photo  on  page  1 .) 

Looking  for  Resources 

Stopping  the  movement  of 
agricultural  contraband  across  the 
river  in  this  area  required  far 
more  resources  than  Akin  and 
Villarreal  had.  Therefore,  they 
sought  cooperation  from  several 
VS  offices  and  employees  in  the 
area,  including  the  Rio  Grande 
City  office  of  VS’  tick  eradication 
program,  VS’  border  surveillance 
animal  health  technicians  (AHT’s), 
and  the  Bird  Quarantine  Station 
at  Moore  Field  in  Mission. 

“VS’  mounted  patrol  inspectors 
(MPI’s)  have  been  especially 
helpful  to  us  because  they  rou¬ 
tinely  patrol  their  assigned  area 
along  the  river  on  horseback,  in 
vehicles,  and  afoot,”  says  Akin. 


Also  they  are  equipped  with  radios 
for  communication  and  sidearms 
for  protection.  “On  several  occa¬ 
sions,”  Villarreal  adds,  “we  have 
asked  for  and  received  the  MPI’s 
help,  not  only  in  locating  contra¬ 
band,  but  also  in  the  transporta¬ 
tion  of  large  shipments  of  inter¬ 
cepted  avocados  worth  thousands 
of  dollars.” 

Ride-Along  Program 

The  MPI’s  are  alert  to  signs  of 
movement  along  the  river  and 
report  signs  of  human  traffic,  such 
as  footprints  or  automobile  tracks, 
to  the  U.S.  Border  Patrol  and  the 
U.S.  Customs  Service’s  Office  of 
Investigation.  Since  1991  Akin 
and  Villarreal  have  participated  in 
ride-along  programs  with  the 
Border  Patrol  and  have  a  close 
working  relationship  with  the 
patrol  agents  as  well  as  with  agents 
of  the  Department  of  Interior’s 
U.S.  Fish  &  Wildlife  Service. 

PPQ  also  cooperates  with  these 
groups  in  public  awareness  efforts. 
For  example,  the  Roma /Rio  Grande 
Work  Station  sets  up  a  Public 
Awareness  Booth  at  the  Starr  County 
Livestock  Show  and  Youth  Fair. 
The  booth  is  staffed  by  PPQ,  VS’s 
MPI’s,  border  surveillance  AHT’s, 
and  personnel  from  the  Bird 
Quarantine  Station  and  Biological 
Control  Laboratory  at  Moore  Field. 

As  a  result  of  these  cooperative 
efforts,  APHIS  has  succeeded  in 


the  interdiction  (stopping)  of  a 
variety  of  illegal  agricultural 
products,  including  568  citrus 
trees,  373  cases  of  avocados, 
gamecocks  for  fighting,  and 
protected  birds  such  as  parrots, 
conures,  and  owls.  During  the  last 
2  years,  MPI’s  Raymundo  Morales 
and  Onofre  Rodriguez  from  the  Rio 
Grande  City  Office  have  helped 
Villarreal  and  Akin  with  the 
seizure  and  transportation  of  more 
than  600  cases  of  avocados, 
numerous  cases  of  mangoes,  and  a 
varied  assortment  of  other  agricul¬ 
tural  materials.  In  appreciation  for 
the  work  of  these  two  inspectors, 
PPQ  gave  awards  to  Morales  and 
Rodriguez  this  past  fall. 

“Having  PPQ  recognize  VS 
employees  is  a  first-time  event  for 
APHIS  in  Starr  County,  TX,  and 
probably  anywhere  along  the  U.S.- 
Mexico  border,”  says  Akin.  “We 
just  wanted  to  thank  them  for 
helping  us  do  our  jobs.” 

In  fact,  one  APHIS  is  now  working 
well  in  Starr  County.  On  numer¬ 
ous  occasions  PPQ  has  assisted  VS 
employees  by  sending  them 
abandoned  birds  and  by  reporting 
unauthorized  crossings  of  livestock. 

“Having  such  a  diverse  group  of 
APHIS  employees  in  the  area  is 
good  for  everyone,’’  Akin  says. 
“Through  cooperation,  we  can 
achieve  more  than  by  working 
separately  to  meet  our  mission 
and  serve  the  public.”  ♦ 


To  ensure  maximum  feedback 
from  all  affected  parties,  the  TSE 
Working  Group  actively  cooperates 
with  the  livestock  and  poultry 
industry,  including  such  groups  as 
the  National  Renderers  Associa¬ 
tion,  the  American  Sheep  Industry 
Association,  the  National 
Cattlemen’s  Beef  Association,  and 
the  National  Milk  Producers 
Federation.  Group  members 
regularly  meet  with  other  Govern¬ 
ment  agencies,  including  CDC,  the 
Agricultural  Research  Service,  the 
Food  and  Drug  Administration,  the 
Food  Safety  and  Inspection  Service 
(FSIS),  and  the  National  Institutes 
of  Health  to  exchange  information 
and  policy  about  BSE.  Members 


often  travel  to  the  United  Kingdom 
to  participate  in  BSE  meetings 
with  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Food, 
and  Fishery  officials  and  other 
knowledgeable  British  livestock 
representatives.  The  TSE  Working 
Group  also  works  with  colleges 
and  universities,  with  veterinary 
medicine  programs,  and  veterinary 
diagnostic  laboratories. 

In  August,  members  of  the  TSE 
Working  Group  met  with  FSIS  and 
livestock  and  poultry  industry 
representatives  to  develop  a  BSE 
Response  Plan  for  Secretary 
Glickman. 

“When  finalized,  the  document 
will  provide  a  step-by-step  plan  of 
action  in  the  unlikely  event  that  a 
case  of  BSE  is  detected  in  the 


United  States,”  says  Detwiler. 
“We’re  working  diligently  to  make 
sure  that  the  United  States  avoids 
the  same  chain  of  events  that 
happened  in  the  United  Kingdom.” 

There  has  never  been  a  diag¬ 
nosed  case  of  BSE  in  the  United 
States.  The  U.S.  Government  has 
taken  steps  to  minimize  even 
theoretical  risks  to  the  human 
population  and  domestic  livestock, 
and  the  United  States  maintains 
the  most  effective  and  aggressive 
policies  and  surveillance  programs 
of  any  country  that  is  free  of  BSE. 
BSE  remains  exclusively  a  disease 
among  foreign  animals,  and  the  work 
of  groups  like  the  TSE  Working 
Group  help  keep  it  that  way.  ♦

Inside  APHIS/ 7 


Guam  Employee  Participates  in  Operation  Pacific  Haven 


APHIS  PHOTO 


By  Mitchell  Nelson,  PPQ,  Guam 

With  less  than  12  hours’  notice 
before  the  first  plane  was  to  arrive, 
employees  at  Guam  airport  began 
preparing  for  Operation  Pacific 
Haven — the  humanitarian  airlift 
of  some  2,500  Kurdish  refugees 
from  Northern  Iraq  this  past 
September.  Working  with  the  U.S. 
military  and  other  clearance 
agencies,  I  had  to  ensure  that 
proper  plant  and  animal  quaran¬ 
tine  procedures  were  put  into 
place  for  Operation  Pacific  Haven. 
However,  no  one  knew  the  pest  risk 
of  the  products  that  the  refugees 
might  be  bringing  with  them. 

Most  of  the  work  of  quarantine 
inspection  on  Guam  is  carried  out 
by  Guam  Plant  Quarantine  (GPQ). 
My  role  as  the  OIC  for  Guam  and 
CNMI  (another  U.S.  possession  in 
Micronesia)  and  the  only  APHIS, 
PPQ  employee  in  Guam  is  to  assist 
the  local  government  in  enforcing 
Federal  plant  and  animal  quaran¬ 
tines.  For  this  special  assign¬ 
ment,  I  worked  closely  with  GPQ 
Chief  Russell  Campbell,  two  of  his 
senior  officers,  and  seven  new 
recruits.  One  of  the  first  things  I 
did  was  to  give  the  new  recruits  a 
crash  course  in  passenger  pro¬ 
cessing  procedures  to  prepare 
them  for  the  next  4  days. 

Before  the  operation  began,  the 
military  briefed  us  on  the  arrival 
of  the  refugees.  The  international 
press  was  present,  watching  us  as 
well  as  the  Kurdish  refugees. 

GPQ  and  I  worked  with  Guam 
Customs  on  an  inspection  proce¬ 
dure  that  would  eliminate  primary 
and  secondary  inspection.  Instead, 
all  the  agencies’  employees  would 
line  up  and  inspect  the  passengers 
side  by  side.  Each  agency  would 
bring  its  areas  of  concern  to  the 
other’s  attention. 

The  first  night,  September  17, 
was  the  most  tense  because  none 
of  us  knew  what  to  expect.  What 
type  of  agriculture  would  these 
fleeing  refugees  bring?  The  first 
group  of  refugees  was  given  an 
intense  inspection.  Afterward,  we 
all  realized  that  these  people  were 
truly  refugees,  bringing  little  of 
concern  to  GPQ  officials  or  to  U.S. 
Customs. 

Because  of  the  potential  pest 
risk,  I  had  the  officers  inspect  100 
percent  of  the  passengers.  Customs 
employees,  having  been  relieved  of

their  inspection  duties,  were  glad 
to  help  us.  We  did  a  thorough, 
polite,  and  expeditious  inspection. 

In  fact,  the  military  complemented 
us  twice  on  the  professionalism  of 
our  GPQ  inspectors. 

On  the  five  flights,  we  found  the 
following  prohibited  products: 

25  pounds  of  cucumbers  con¬ 
taining  tephritid  larvae;  10  pounds 
of  hot  peppers;  5  pounds  of  stone 
fruit  seeds;  rice  and  wheat  straw; 
various  unknown  seeds  infested 
with  bruchids;  grave  soil;  300-400 
pairs  of  shoes  caked  in  mud. 
Although  not  a  lot  of  contraband 
was  found,  all  of  it  was  high  risk. 

A  Sad  Yet  Happy  Incident 

The  grave  soil  was  from  the 
grave  of  a  13-year-old  Kurdish  girl 
who  died  just  before  the  plane  left. 
The  grieving  family  was  distraught 
about  it  being  taken  away;  even 
the  civilian  escorts  were  crying. 

Soil  is  a  high-risk  product  because 
it  can  harbor  both  pests  and 
diseases;  however,  it  can  come 
into  the  country  if  it  is  treated 
with  heat.  I  took  the  soil  home  and 
baked  it  at  the  proper  temperature 
and  gave  it  to  a  military  employee, 
who  returned  it  to  the  family. 


On  the  4  days  in  September,  I 
was  the  first  person  to  board  each 
plane  on  its  arrival.  Normally,  we 
wait  for  passengers  to  deplane 
before  we  board,  but  because  of 
the  potential  for  insect  pests,  I 
wanted  to  check  the  passenger 
compartment  and  cargo  holds 
before  the  passengers  got  off.  With 
the  GPQ  recruits,  we  boarded  the 
aircraft,  checked  out  the  catering, 
gathered  up  food  items,  and 
looked  for  hitchhiking  pests. 

Assisting  Refugees 

After  the  plane  was  cleared,  I 
and  the  senior  GPQ  officers 
assisted  the  military  in  receiving 
the  refugees — shaking  hands, 
assisting  children  and  the  elderly 
off  the  plane,  and  directing 
traffic.  Smiles  and  hugs  were  in 
abundance. 

GPQ  employees  thoroughly 
inspected  the  cargo  hold  of  each 
flight  where  they  found  some  of 
the  peppers  and  stone  fruit.  Also 
wood  borers  were  found  in  the 
wood  pallets  used  to  carry  cargo 
aboard,  so  those  pallets  were 
incinerated.  Soil  was  also  found 
and  cleaned  up. 

It  took  about  an  hour  and  a  half 
after  the  plane  landed  before  the 
first  passengers  arrived  in  the 
clearance  area.  While  waiting  to 
begin  their  work,  GPQ  employees 
assisted  the  military  wives,  who 
were  passing  out  refreshments 
and  helping  the  time  go  by  pleas¬ 
antly  for  the  children.  The  mili¬ 
tary  and  the  community  provided 
extra  clothes  and  lots  of  toys  for 
the  families. 

Those  who  participated  in  the 
operation — the  military,  other 
agencies,  and  hundreds  of  volun¬ 
teers — said  it  was  an  experience  of 
a  lifetime.  The  operation  also 
showed  that  APHIS  can  perform  its 
mission  under  trying  circum¬ 
stances  in  a  humanitarian  manner. 

All  of  us  averaged  8  hours  of 
sleep  each  in  the  96  hours  of 
Operation  Pacific  Haven.  We  spent 
a  lot  of  time  waiting  for  planes  to 
arrive  or  waiting  for  passengers  to 
process.  We  still  had  to  attend  normal 
daylight  operations — meetings, 
paperwork,  and  preparations  for  a 
move  from  the  old  Guam  airport  to 
the  new  one — between  flights.  All 
of  us  agree,  however,  that  we 
would  not  have  missed  participat¬ 
ing  in  the  operation  for  anything.  ♦

Officials  Urge  Committee  To  Increase  Workforce  Diversity

AC's  Nancy  Ellifrit,  a  veterinarian  in  Oklahoma,  and  VS'  Rick  Hill,  a 
veterinarian  at  Ames,  IA,  talk  during  a  break  in  the  Workforce 
Diversity  Committee's  annual  workshop. 


“Be  bold,”  and  “Just  do  it.”  With 
these  words.  Marketing  and 
Regulatory  Programs  Assistant 
Secretary  Mike  Dunn  and  Deputy 
Assistant  Secretary  Shirley 
Watkins  challenged  the  APHIS 
Workforce  Diversity  Steering 
Committee  at  its  meeting  in  River- 
dale,  MD.  The  committee  met 
September  23-27  to  review  its  past 
year  and  set  priorities  for  the 
coming  year. 

In  separate  visits,  Dunn  and 
Watkins  offered  their  advice  and 
encouragement  to  the  committee. 
Watkins  urged  APHIS  to  open  its 
doors  wider  to  people  of  diverse 
cultural  backgrounds.  She  stressed 
the  need  to  reach  out  and  help  end 
USDA’s  status  as  the  “best  kept 
secret”  in  offering  promising 
careers  that  are  nontraditional  for 
many  cultures.  She  encouraged 
the  committee  to  look  at  a  wide 
variety  of  outreach  options  such  as 
creating  opportunities  with 
schools,  especially  at  very  early 
grades.  Drawing  on  her  own 
background  as  an  educator, 
Watkins  suggested  working  with 
high  school  counselors  since  they 
usually  advise  people  to  seek 
careers  in  areas  they  know  about. 

While  urging  APHIS  to  reach  out, 
Watkins  emphasized  the  importance 
of  having  a  welcoming  environ¬ 
ment  for  people  coming  into  the 
agency.  She  praised  the  committee’s 
work  toward  building  a  supportive 
environment  for  all  employees.  As 
part  of  its  ongoing  education 
efforts,  the  committee  has  developed 
and  delivered  diversity  awareness 
training  sessions  widely  across 
APHIS  over  the  past  several  years. 

Dunn  also  expressed  support  for 
the  committee’s  vision  of  “creating 
an  environment  where  all  employ¬ 
ees  are  encouraged  and  empowered 
to  attain  their  full  potential,  thus 
ensuring  the  attainment  of  agency 
goals.”  Dunn  said,  “I  know  that  I 
only  have  to  do  one  thing  to  be 
successful,  and  that  is  to  optimize 
the  skills,  knowledges  and  abilities 
of  the  people  I  work  with.”  He  added 
that  he  would  know  if  he  had  been 
successful  if  people  were  better  off 
for  having  worked  with  him  because 
he  “paid  attention  to  their  needs.” 

Dunn  recognized  the  committee’s 
efforts  in  making  managing 
diversity  a  part  of  competencies  in 


selecting  managers  as  well  as  a 
consideration  in  workforce  plan¬ 
ning.  Accomplishments  in  promot¬ 
ing  workforce  diversity  are  now  a 
part  of  the  Senior  Executive 
Service  evaluation  process. 

After  reading  and  reaffirming 
the  MRP  civil  rights  policy,  Dunn 
spoke  of  the  business  rationale  for 
supporting  all  employees.  “If  you 
are  worried  about  being  harassed 
or  hindered  because  of  factors  such 
as  race,  gender,  or  sexual  orienta¬ 
tion,  you  won’t  be  able  to  give  your 
best  to  the  agency  at  a  time  when 
we  need  the  best  from  every  one  of 
our  people,”  said  Dunn. 

Buoyed  by  Dunn  and  Watkins 
visits,  the  committee  adopted  some 
ambitious  goals  for  the  coming 
year.  Committee  members  will 
continue  to  work  closely  with  the 
individual  strategy  groups  of  the 
APHIS  change  agenda,  as  well  as 
other  groups  such  as  the  Work- 
Family-Life  Council,  the  One 
APHIS  Team  for  Valuing  People, 
and  the  new  Conflict  Prevention 
and  Resolution  initiative. 

Members  will  continue  to  refine 
a  Diversity  for  Teams  training 
package  developed  and  piloted  this 
year  in  concert  with  Work-  Family- 


Life  members  and  Organizational 
and  Professional  Development. 

The  package  will  be  part  of  the 
team  effectiveness  series  that  is 
an  important  part  of  the  team- 
based  organization  strategy  of  the 
change  agenda.  The  package 
combines  videos  and  team  exer¬ 
cises  to  help  teams  see  their 
diversity  as  a  strength  and  use  it 
to  increase  performance. 

Other  ongoing  initiatives  of  the 
committee  include  completing 
development  of  a  home  page  on  the 
Internet  to  promote  education  and 
dialogue  on  workforce  diversity, 
establishing  a  workforce  diversity 
library,  and  creating  and  funding 
an  award  to  recognize  achieve¬ 
ments  in  promoting  diversity  and 
work-family-life  programs. 

New  initiatives  include  estab¬ 
lishing  a  pilot  project  to  measure 
results  from  application  of  manag¬ 
ing  diversity  principles. 

As  committee  members  wrapped 
up  the  week  and  set  up  conference 
calls  for  continuing  their  work,  they 
did  so  knowing  that  “just  doing” 
the  planned  projects  would  repre¬ 
sent  the  next  "bold  steps”  called 
for  by  the  MRP  leadership.  ♦

Eradicating  Boll  Weevil  With  a  Little  Help  From  Friends 


PPQ’s  Debborah  McPartlan  (center), 
co-director  of  the  Texas  Boll  Weevil 
Eradication  Program,  presents  an 
award  to  Tim  Roland,  PPQ’s  chief  of 
equipment  and  aircraft  operations 
(AEO)  at  Moore  Field,  TX.  The  award 


was  presented  to  Roland  and  his  team 
(pictured  here)  for  developing  field 
spray  equipment  and  monitoring  the 
performance  of  aerial  contract  pilots  in 
the  rapidly  expanding  program  zones 
of  South  Texas  and  its  Central  and 


Southern  Rolling  Plains. 
The  program  is  a 
cooperative  one, 
primarily  funded  by 
cotton  growers  in  Texas. 
APHIS  provides  partial 
funding,  technical 
expertise,  and 
coordination  among  the 
boll  weevil  eradication 
programs  across  the 
cotton  belt.  The  program 
uses  an  integrated 
management  system  including 
applying  an  ultralow  volume  of 
malathion  at  12  oz  per  acre, 
plowdown  regulations,  and  trapping 
to  monitor  population  buildups. 


Regulatory  Enforcement  Takes  the  RE  in  REAC  to  M&B 


By  Jim  Rogers,  Public  Affairs,  LPA 

Back  in  1988,  APHIS  underwent 
a  major  reorganization,  creating 
1 1  units  from  3.  One  of  the  new 
units  was  REAC — a  program  unit 
formed  by  combining  the  Animal 
Care  (AC)  section  of  VS  with 
Regulatory  Enforcement  (RE), 
another  VS  subunit. 

Since  then,  the  needs  of  both 
staffs  have  evolved,  and  now,  8 
years  later,  the  two  staffs  have 
undergone  another  change:  On 
Sept.  29,  1996,  RE  joined  M&B  (its 
name  is  still  Regulatory  Enforce¬ 
ment)  where  it  can  more  effectively 
support  all  program  units  needing 
enforcement:  and  Animal  Care 
became  a  stand-alone  unit  known 
simply  as  AC. 

“These  changes  will  strengthen 
everyone  in  the  future,”  says  Ron 
Stanley,  assistant  deputy  adminis¬ 
trator  of  Regulatory  Enforcement. 
“Because  we  are  a  support  pro¬ 
gram,  M&B  seems  like  the  logical 
place  to  be.  Reorganizing  with 
M&B  will  allow  us  to  clarify  our 
support  role.” 

Regulatory  Enforcement’s 
mission  is  to  provide  leadership, 
direction,  and  support  for  investi¬ 
gative  and  enforcement  activities 


throughout  APHIS.  Through  its 
field  investigators  and  staff 
specialists,  RE  contributes  to  the 
APHIS  mission  by  investigating 
violations  in  the  laws,  standards, 
and  regulations  for  VS,  the  new 
AC,  and  PPQ. 

Enforcing  Programs’  Laws 

Each  of  the  programs  that  RE 
supports  has  different  laws  with 
different  regulations  that  must  be 
enforced.  For  AC,  RE  enforces  two 
Acts  with  their  accompanying 
standards  and  regulations — the 
Animal  Welfare  Act  and  the  Horse 
Protection  Act.  PPQ  has  at  least  10 
acts  that  it  enforces,  including  the 
Plant  Quarantine  Act,  the  Federal 
Plant  Pest  Act,  and  the  Endan¬ 
gered  Species  Act.  The  Unit  with 
the  largest  number  of  acts  or  laws 
is  VS.  VS  acts  include  the  Swine 
Health  Protection  Act,  the  Cattle 
Contagious  Disease  Act,  and  the 
Virus-Serum-Toxin  Act. 

Along  with  investigations,  RE 
also  reviews,  evaluates,  and 
processes  alleged  violations  in 
close  cooperation  with  USDA’s 
Office  of  the  General  Counsel  and 
APHIS  program  officials.  Staff 
specialists  maintain  complete  case 
files  of  alleged  violators  and 


accurately  track  investigations 
and  program  violations  using  the 
APHIS  Compliance  Investigation 
Tracking  System  data  base. 

RE  regularly  prepares  and 
issues  warning  letters  and  recom¬ 
mends  penalties  for  violators  of 
APHIS  laws  and  regulations.  RE 
can  also  work  with  violators  by 
using  a  stipulation  process  that 
allows  license  holders  to  reach 
compliance  without  entering  into 
the  administrative  law  process. 
Currently,  RE  has  56  investigators 
on  its  staff. 

Changing  Without  Moving 

Stanley  points  out  that  the 
merger  of  RE  with  M&B  really  won't 
have  too  much  effect  on  either  of 
the  former  parts  of  REAC.  He  main¬ 
tains  that  AC  will  still  receive 
RE’s  full  support,  and  that  as  part 
of  M&B,  support  to  PPQ  and  VS 
will  grow.  The  change  won’t  affect 
either  group's  budget  or  staffing. 
They  won’t  even  switch  offices. 

“We  will  continue  to  work  with 
all  APHIS  programs,"  Stanley  says. 
“And,  since  we  will  work  with  all 
APHIS  programs,  any  time  we  see 
an  area  where  the  ’One  APHIS’

WAC  Week  Challenges  Women  To  Consider  Outside  Careers 

By  Bettye  Walters,  Veterinary  Biologies,  VS 


APHIS  PHOTO  BY  ANN . CZAPIEWSKI 


Best-selling  writer  Connie  Briscoe  tells  the  APHIS  audience  attending 
a  WAC-week  program  that  there  is  opportunity  for  minority  and  women 
writers.  Behind  her,  an  interpreter  signs  for  the  hearing  impared. 


The  Women’s  Advisory  Commit¬ 
tee  (WAC)  held  its  annual  WAC 
Week  activities  in  Riverdale,  MD, 
this  past  September.  The  theme  of 
this  year’s  program  was  “Career 
Satisfaction  in  the  Rightsizing  90’s.” 

One  of  the  most  popular  of  the 
week-long  programs  was  the 
kickoff  presentation  entitled 
“Making  Your  Dreams  a  Reality.” 
This  was  a  moderated,  five-person 
panel  discussion  on  matching 
one’s  abilities,  interests,  and 
passions  with  career  choice. 

Diverse  Women's  Group 

The  panel  consisted  of  a 
diverse  group  of  women,  including 
Doris  Ligon,  who  founded  and 
operates  a  museum  that  special¬ 
izes  in  African  art;  Denise 
Sofranko,  a  former  VS  veterinarian 
who  founded  her  own  home 
business  that  specializes  in  tour 
management  and  publicity;  and 
Charlotte  Travieso,  a  former  M&B 
employee,  who  is  now  a  consultant 
with  private  industry.  The  panel¬ 
ists  stressed  that  if  people  follow 
their  passions,  job  satisfaction  will 
accompany  them  wherever  they  go. 

The  WAC  Committee  was  also 
fortunate  to  have  two  nationally 
known,  best-selling  authors — 
Audrey  B.  Chapman,  author  of 
Getting  Good  Loving  and  Connie 
Briscoe,  author  of  Sisters  and 
Lovers  and  Big  Girls  Don’t  Cry. 

They  lectured  and  read  from  their 
books.  Briscoe  told  the  audience 
that  the  market  is  now  excellent 
for  beginning  novelists  and  there 
is  real  interest  and  opportunity  for 
minority  and  women  writers.  She 
encouraged  all  who  “have  a  story 
in  them”  to  give  it  a  shot. 

Roundtable  With  Managers 

We  repeated  one  of  the  most 
popular  WAC  Week  forums,  the 
round-table  discussion  with  an 
APHIS  panel  of  managers.  The 


panel  members  took  questions 
from  the  audience  and  gave  their 
ideas  on  which  skills  will  be 
important  in  the  21st-century 
workplace. 

Employees  came  out  for  the 
sessions,  attending  them  well  and 
commenting  favorably.  Says  Jack 
Edmundson  of  PPD,  “I  really 
enjoyed  the  programs  I  could 
attend — they  were  of  very  high 
quality  and  useful.  Of  all  the 
speakers  and  programs  APHIS 
sponsors,  WAC  Week  is  one  of  the 
most  valuable.  The  WAC  Week 
committee  did  a  vexy  good  job.” 

As  Chair  of  this  year’s  WAC 
Week,  I’d  like  to  thank  everyone 


who  helped  make  this  year’s  event 
a  success.  The  enthusiastic 
support  and  participation  of  APHIS 
employees  has  helped  WAC  tre¬ 
mendously  in  achieving  its  goal  of 
improving  the  professional  and 
personal  lives  of  the  women  and 
men  in  our  agency. 

This  year,  we  arranged  with  LPA 
to  have  copies  of  the  videotaped 
presentations  available  for  employ¬ 
ees  in  other  offices.  Anyone 
interested  in  obtaining  copies  of 
the  presentations  may  contact 
WAC  president  Barbara  Kohn  at 
(301)  734-8271.  ♦ 


vision  can  be  realized,  we  will 
make  suggestions  to  implement 
the  vision. 

“In  RE,  we  try  to  be  efficient 
and  progressive,”  continues 
Stanley,  pointing  out  that  RE  has 
already  moved  to  a  two-region 


concept.  “We’ve  been  working  in  a 
two-region  organization  for  the 
better  part  of  a  year,”  he  adds. 

The  new  change  in  structure 
will  also  change  the  way  RE 
employees  are  reviewed.  “In  the 
future,  most  of  the  weight  in 
performance  reviews  will  come 


from  our  customers’  evaluations  of 
our  services,”  says  Stanley.  He  is 
excited  about  the  prospect  of  full- 
program  feedback  and  says  that 
everyone  in  RE  is  “quite  enthusi¬ 
astic."  ♦

APHIS  Alumni  Organization 
(AAO)  members  continue  to  hold 
monthly  meetings  in  Riverdale, 

MD,  and  to  build  an  AAO  organiza¬ 
tion.  The  group  wants  APHIS  to 
designate  an  employee  in  each 
State  for  liaison  with  an  AAO 
member.  This  arrangement  would 
provide  APHIS  with  personnel  who 
could  be  tapped  in  emergencies 
and  would  build  a  platform  for 
AAO  participation.  In  California, 
Norman  Mullaly,  PPQ,  Sacramento, 
is  the  APHIS  employee  and  Earl 
Grass  is  the  AAO  member. 

Retirees  and  members  are  now 
receiving  minutes  of  all  meetings, 
rosters  of  retirees,  reports  of

Alumni  Activities 

AAO  member  Bob  Brittingham 
(formerly  PPQ)  works  4  hours  each 
week  at  the  Professional  Develop¬ 
ment  Center  (PDC)  at  Frederick, 
MD.  Each  Tuesday  Brittingham 
shows  up  at  the  office  where  he 
photocopies  training  material. 


distributes  information  to  the  staff, 
boxes  materials  for  shipment  to 
the  field,  or  assembles  materials 
for  the  new  officers  training 
classes. 

“After  I  retired,”  he  recalls,  “I 
was  visiting  a  friend  at  PDC  who 
was  lamenting  that  he  didn’t  have 
time  to  package  up  a  large  stack  of 
helmets  near  his  desk.  I  volunteered 
to  do  it  for  him.  I  estimate  I  have 
given  them  250  hours  by  now.” 
Brittingham  worked  at  PDC  from 
1979  to  1985. 

AAO  Vice  President  Frank 
Mulhem  (former  administrator) 
came  to  Beltsville,  MD,  in  Septem¬ 
ber  to  speak  at  a  commemoration 
of  the  30th  anniversary  of  the 
enactment  of  the  Animal  Welfare 
Act  in  1966.  Mulhem  provided  an 
historical  perspective  of  the  Act. 

This  past  summer,  AAO  member 
George  Winegar  (formerly  VS)  had 
a  great  time  working  with  4-H 
youths  at  the  Michigan  State  fair. 

AAO  member  John  Kennedy 
(formerly  PPQ)  traveled  to  England 
where  he  spoke  with  British 
officials  about  Bovine  Spongiform 
Encephalopathy  (BSE)  and  gave 
them  a  package  of  BSE-related 
information  gathered  from  APHIS 
and  other  sources. 

AAO  member  Rosemary  Stanko 
(formerly  PPQ)  attended  a  focus 


group  sponsored  by  the  Secretary’s 
office  on  retirement.  Two  of  the 
issues  discussed  were  credit  for 
retirement  contributions  made 
outside  of  Government  and  the 
way  we  ignore  psychological 
aspects  of  retirement. 

AAO  President  Harry  Mussman 
(former  administrator)  attended  an 
American  Veterinary  Medical 
Association  meeting  in  Louisville, 
KY,  where  he  presented  a  paper  on 
use  of  food  irradiation  to  reduce 
pathogens  and  therefore  make  food 
safer  for  consumers. 

A  Retirement  Life 

AAO  member  Vaughn  Von 
Zelyar  (formerly  M&B)  leads  a 
retirement  life  that  is  both  full  and 
satisfying.  She  is  on  the  alumni 
board  at  Montgomery  College, 
Takoma  Park,  MD,  and  recently 
completed  a  University  of  Mary¬ 
land  course  while  visiting  in 
Germany.  She  believes  in  the 
lifelong  pursuit  of  learning.  She 
travels  extensively  with  travel 
clubs,  and  works  out  at  a  gym  3 
days  a  week.  She  keeps  1  day  a 
week  for  herself.  Other  days  are 
spent  with  her  church,  where  she 
teaches;  with  her  family,  with 
whom  she  remains  close;  and  with 
many  other  activities.  ♦

Some  employees  got  a  taste  of 
Hollywood  this  year  when  the 
Agriculture  Quarantine  Inspection 
campaign  hired  a  production  company 
to  film  a  public  service  announcement. 
The  company  chose  the  National 
Arboretum  in  Washington,  DC,  for  the 
site,  turning  an  open  area  with  U.S. 
capitol  columns  into  an  overseas 
market  scene.  The  PSA,  which 
advises  travelers  not  to  bring  home 
prohibited  fruits,  vegetables  and 
meats,  was  distributed  to  national  and 
cable  television  stations  and  has  been 
running  this  year.

Balkans — Recently,  Chris  Groocock, 
IS  Veterinary  Attache  in  Vienna, 
Austria,  visited  Slovakia,  Hungary, 
Croatia,  and  Slovenia  to  discuss 
foot-and-mouth  disease  outbreaks 
in  the  Balkans.  These  countries 
have  not  reported  FMD  but  are 
very  concerned  about  its  spread 
across  their  borders.  Considerable 
commerce  transits  Eastern  Europe 
and  Turkey  into  Western  Europe. 

Chile — VS’  Brucellosis  Program 
Director  Claude  Barton,  and  VS’ 
Valerie  Benson  (TN)  went  to  Chile 
in  August  to  conduct  seven  training 
courses  for  the  Chilean  Depart¬ 
ment  of  Agriculture.  These  train¬ 
ing  courses  will  help  the  Chileans 
in  their  preparations  for  starting  a 
brucellosis  eradication  program. 

China — A  veterinary  delegation 
from  the  People’s  Republic  of 
China  (PRC)  recently  inspected  a 
number  of  U.S.  artificial  insemina¬ 
tion  and  embryo  transfer  centers 
in  order  to  export  bovine  semen 
and  embryos  to  the  PRC.  VS’ 

Najam  Faizi  coordinated  these  site 
inspections. 

A  newly  built  state-of-the-art-heat 
treatment  facility  is  now  ready  for 
APHIS  inspection  and  approval  in 
Singapore.  This  facility  will  ease 
the  importation  of  niger  seeds  into 
the  United  States.  Currently,  niger 
seed  imports  from  all  countries 
must  be  heat  treated  as  a  condi¬ 
tion  of  entry  because  of  contami¬ 
nation  with  noxious  weed  seeds. 

IS’  Darcy  Axe,  head  of  the 
preclearance  program,  and  Agri¬ 
cultural  Attache  in  North  Korea 
Dennis  Hannapel  visited  this 
facility  in  October. 

Guatemala — The  U.S. -Guatemala 
Moscamed  program  signed  a 
landmark  contract  to  privatize 
management  and  labor  at  the 
sterile  Mediterranean  fruit  fly 
rearing  facility  in  El  Pino,  Guate¬ 
mala.  A  contractor,  Biosistemas, 
was  granted  a  concession  begin¬ 
ning  in  October  to  rear  and 
sterilize  Medflies  meeting  certain 
production  and  quality  standards. 
IS  will  remain  involved  in  the 
production  side  of  the  operations. 


Honduras — The  Government  of 
Honduras  continues  to  restrict  the 
importation  of  U.S.  rice  because  of 
rice  smut.  IS’  Alex  Thiermann  and 
John  Greifer  attended  the  World 
Trade  Organization’s  Sanitary  and 
Phytosanitary  Commission  Commit¬ 
tee  meeting  in  Geneva,  Switzerland, 
in  October  to  deal  with  this  issue. 

Iceland,  Finland,  and  the  Nether¬ 
lands — VS’  Roger  Perkins  is 
developing  new  import  protocols 
for  sheep  and  goat  semen  from 
Iceland  and  Finland  and  for  the 
importation  of  swine  semen  from 
the  Netherlands. 

Mexico — The  Assistant  Secretaries 
of  Agriculture  of  the  United  States, 
Guatemala,  Mexico,  and  Belize 
met  in  Mexico  City,  Mexico,  this 
past  August  for  the  29th  Meeting 
of  the  Moscamed  Program.  The 
purpose  of  this  meeting  was  to 
decide  what  cooperative  actions 
can  be  taken  to  strengthen  the 
sterile  fly  barrier  along  the  Guate- 
malan-Mexico  border  during  fiscal 
year  1997.  Assistant  Secretary  for 
Marketing  and  Regulatory  Pro¬ 
grams  Michael  Dunn  led  the  USDA 
delegation.  He  was  accompanied

Medfly  Program  Manager  John 
Stewart  and  Regional  Director 
Farouk  Hamdy;  and  Mexican  IS 
Associate  Regional  Director  Gary

VS’  Larry  Miller  and  ARS  scien¬ 
tists,  represented  the  United 
States  recently  at  the  9th  Interna¬ 
tional  Conference  on  Trichinae  in 
Mexico  City.  Both  the  United 
States  and  the  European  Union 
are  considering  the  implementa¬ 
tion  of  on-farm,  trichinae-safe 
Good  Production  Practices  (GPP), 
coupled  with  herd  and/or  wildlife 
reservoir  serological  monitoring. 
APHIS,  ARS.  FSIS,  and  the  Na¬ 
tional  Pork  Producers  Council  are 
collaborating  in  the  development  of 
a  pilot  project  that  utilizes  the  GPP 
approach  to  certify  herd  owners 
using  trichinae-safe  processes. 


Netherlands  and  Germany — Last 
month,  VS’  Donald  Randall, 

Director  of  the  Center  for  Veterinary 
Biologies  in  Ames,  Iowa, 
inspected  two  facilities,  one  in 
Amsterdam,  Netherlands,  and 
another  one  in  Bergwedel,  Germany. 
U.S.  distributors  have  applied  for 
permits  to  import  veterinary 
biologies  from  these  firms.  These 
are  the  first  applications  to  import 
into  the  United  States  injectable 
veterinary  biologies  manufactured 
in  Europe  under  GATT  provisions. 

A  full  APHIS  risk  assessment  will 
be  required  as  part  of  the  approval 
process. 

Peru — More  than  400  alpacas  and 
llamas  arrived  at  the  Harry  S 
Truman  Animal  Import  Center  in 
Florida  this  past  August,  after  a 
quarantine  in  Peru  that  lasted 
nearly  4  months.  The  animals 
remained  at  the  quarantine  center 
until  November  9.  VS’  Anna 
Welsch  (NJ),  Tim  Falls  (HI),  Frank 
Humphreys  (MS),  Ned  Cardenas 
(FL),  and  Victor  Becerra  (LA) 
supervised  the  embarkation 
quarantine  in  Tacna,  Peru.  Tho¬ 
mas  D’Amura  (OK)  was  an  alter¬ 
nate.  VS’  Richard  Overton,  at 
Gainsville,  FL,  coordinated  the 
staff  that  oversees  the  quarantine. 

Russia — VS’  Marolo  Garcia,  Robert 
Kahrs,  Jim  Pearson,  and  Dave 
Vogt,  and  IS’  Karen  Shank  and 
Chris  Groocock  participated  in  a 
Russian-U.S.  Scientific  Seminar 
on  Diseases  of  Poultry  in  St. 
Petersburg,  Russia,  this  past 
August.  The  meetings  were  held 
at  the  Russian  Poultry  Science 
and  Veterinaiy  Research  Institute 
at  Lomonosov.  Participants  from 
both  countries  exchanged  poultry 
disease  information  and  diagnostic 
and  research  procedures. 

South  Africa — A  protocol  for  the 
export  of  U.S.  pork  to  the  Republic 
of  South  Africa  was  negotiated  by 
a  U.S.  delegation  represented  by 
MRP  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary 
Shirley  Watkins,  VS'  Andrea 
Morgan,  PPQ’s  Robert  Spaide,  and 
other  USDA  officials  at  a  confer¬ 
ence  in  Capetown  last  month.

Identifiers  at  New  York's  Plant  Inspection  Station  Go  Proactive 


APHIS  PHOTO  BY  REGINA  BROWNE  KENNEY 


Michael  Kenney  (left)  and  John  Arcery  work  at  PPQ’s  plant  inspection 
station  at  the  John  F.  Kennedy  International  Airport. 


John  Arcery  and  Michael 
Kenney  both  work  for  the  PPQ 
plant  inspection  station  at  John  F. 
Kennedy  International  Airport 
(JFKLA).  Arcery  is  the  botanist  on 
staff,  and  Kenney  is  the  staff  s 
plant  pathologist.  While  both  help 
identify  plants  and  diseases 
referred  to  them  by  the  PPQ 
officers  working  on  line,  the  two 
have  good  track  records  in  reach¬ 
ing  out  to  the  community  with 
their  skills  and  expertise. 

What  the  Toddler  Swallowed 

Arceiy’s  skills  and  willingness 
to  help  out  bring  people  to  his  door 
or  telephone  regularly  with  re¬ 
quests  for  help.  This  past  summer, 
for  example,  a  colleague  from  the 
State  University  of  New  York  at 
Farmingdale,  NY,  telephoned 
Arcery  about  a  tracheal  sample  he 
had  received  from  the  attending 
physician  of  a  15-month-old  boy. 
The  toddler  had  gotten  into  some¬ 
thing  in  the  kitchen  then  vomited 
and  aspirated  some  of  it.  He  went 
into  respiratory  arrest,  became 
unconscious,  and  was  rushed  to 
the  hospital.  There,  the  doctor 
removed  the  blockage  and  saved 
the  child  but  wanted  to  identify 
the  substance.  The  doctor  wanted 
to  make  sure  that  the  child  also 
wasn’t  having  a  reaction  to  the 
unknown  substance. 

The  tracheal  specimen  was 
delivered  to  Arcery’s  home  that 
evening,  and  Arcery  brought  the 
sample  to  work  the  following  day 
and  looked  at  it  under  a  stereo 
microscope.  The  one-mm  fragment 
of  seed  coat  was  enough  for  him  to 
identify  the  substance  immediately 
as  mustard  seed — a  spicy  condi¬ 
ment  for  a  toddler  but  not  toxic. 

“I  get  contacted  frequently  by 
the  Food  and  Drug  Administration, 
U.S.  Customs,  or  the  poison 
control  center  asking  me  to  look  at 
things,”  says  Arcery.  "I  look  at  them 
as  1  have  time,  or  if  the  situation 
could  be  life-threatening,  right 
away.  We  have  to  realize  that  in 
the  Government,  we  are  in  the 
public  service.  If  we  can  help  the 
public  out,  we  should  do  it.” 

Outreach  to  Scientists 

While  Arcery’s  public  usually 
comes  to  him,  Kenney  has  spent 
the  past  2  years  reaching  out  to 
the  scientific  community  and 
telling  them  about  contributions  of 


PPQ’s  officers  and  identifiers  to 
taxonomy.  At  national  meetings  of 
the  American  Phytopathological 
Society  and  the  Mycological 
Society  of  America,  Kenney  has 
presented  posters  publicizing  the 
work  of  PPQ.  This  year  at  the  joint 
meeting  of  these  two  societies, 
Kenney  presented  two  posters — 
"The  Discovery  of  New  Species  of 
Rust  Fungi  at  U.S.  Ports  of  Entry 
by  USDA  Officers,"  and  “Orchid  Rust 
Fungi  (Uredinales)  of  the  World.” 

Kenney  devoted  the  first  poster 
to  the  interceptions  by  PPQ  officers 
at  U.S.  ports  across  the  country 
and  how  these  interceptions  led  to 
the  discovery  of  five  new  species  of 
rusts  on  orchids  imported  for 
propagation.  Kenney,  whose 
specialty  is  rust  fungus  taxonomy, 
has  been  working  closely  with  PPQ 
mycologist  Mary  Palm,  who  is 
located  at  the  USDA/Agricultural 
Research  Service’s  National 
Fungus  Collection  in  Beltsville, 
MD,  and  who  makes  the  final  calls 
on  the  identification  of  fungi. 

“I’ve  had  free  access  to  the 


fantastic  National  Fungus  Collec¬ 
tion  in  Beltsville,"  explains 
Kenney,  “and  I  have  been  able  to 
increase  my  knowledge  by  study¬ 
ing  the  taxonomy,  host  range,  and 
geographic  distribution  of  foreign 
orchid  rusts  and  other  diseases." 

Kenney  is  developing  color 
photos  and  keys  for  fungi,  and 
these  will  be  sent  to  identifiers  in 
other  plant  inspection  stations 
around  the  country. 

"At  JFKLA,  we  get  material  from 
all  over  the  world,”  says  Kenney, 
“but  we  don’t  get  everything.”  One 
of  the  new  rust  species  was  found 
on  spikemoss  at  the  Plant  Inspec¬ 
tion  Station  in  San  Fransisco,  CA, 
imported  as  herbal  medicine  from 
China.  The  discovery  of  the  rust  on 
spikemoss  was  the  first  time  a 
rust  was  ever  found  on  this 
primitive  plant  group. 

“I  think  the  scientific  commu¬ 
nity  needs  to  know  that  our  work 
adds  to  the  basic  scientific  knowl¬ 
edge  as  well  as  being  important 
from  a  plant  quarantine  stand¬ 
point,"  Kenney  says.  ♦

James  Cavanaugh,  IS’  Regional 
Attache  in  Nairobi,  Kenya,  accom¬ 
panied  the  U.S.  delegation  to 
meetings  in  Capetown  and 
Pretoria.  APHIS  representatives 
believe  that  these  discussions  will 
eventually  lead  to  more  market 
opportunities  for  both  the  United 
States  and  South  Africa. 

Switzerland — VS’  John  Gray  and 
Lisa  Ferguson  are  coordinating  the 
negotiations  between  the  United 
States  and  Switzerland  on  pet  food 
issues  and  between  the  United 


States  and  the  European  Union  on 
veterinary  equivalence. 

Taiwan — VS'  Najam  Faizi  and  PPQ’s 
John  Thaw  attended  the  6th  U.S.- 
Taiwan  Bilateral  Technical  Dis¬ 
cussions  held  in  Taipi  this  past 
September.  Important  sanitary  and 
phytosanitary  issues  were  discussed. 

Also,  VS  Najam  Faizi’s  supervision 
of  a  shipment  of  ostriches  from 
Pennsylvania  to  Taiwan  represents 
a  new  export  market  for  the  U.S. 
ratite  industry. 


Zimbabwe — VS’  Roger  Perkins  met 
with  veterinary  authorities  in  the 
Republic  of  South  Africa  this  past 
July.  As  a  result,  Perkins  is  now 
working  on  a  project  to  import 
bovine  embryos  from  Zimbabwe 
into  the  United  States.  If  this 
project  is  successful,  it  will  be  the 
first  legal  importation  of  bovine 
genetics  into  the  United  States 
from  Africa.  ♦
