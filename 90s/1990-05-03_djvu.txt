GHS Band Earns Top Rating at State Festival 


By Nancy Lemmen 


The Grayling High School Band eamed its very first ] 
(Superior) rating at the Michigan School Band and Orchestra 
Association’s (M.S.B.0.A.) State Band Festival in Class C 
competition on April 28. 

“The students came through even with the odds against 
them,” said GHS Band Director Dennis Ormsbec. “We had 
four rehearsals before State competition after having 11 days 
off for Easter vacation.” 

They “tired near the end of the performance,” he continued. 
“The temperature was a big obstacle in the performance and 
sight reading room. It must have been above the 90 degree 
mark in those two rooms.” 

For State, Mr. Ormsbee chose “Patraie Fideles,” arranged by 
Barker; “The Lion of Luceme,” by James Cumow; and “Heral- 


dic Legend,” by Elliott Del Borgo. The first and third pieces 
are different than those the band played in District competition 
in March, so they spent much of the past few weeks lcaming 
their new music. 

One impressed parent added, “Dennis has them learn such 
difficult music for their performance that the sight reading 
piece was easy for them.” 


“Lam very proud of the students. ... We have come a long 
way inthe last few years and (they) are ready to go on to higher 
accomplishments. It is great to be part of this organization,” 
enthused Director Ormsbee. 

Of the four adjudicators rating the GHS band, three retumed 
1 (the highest possible) ratings and one rated the performance 
a Il (the second highest rating). 

The judges appeared impressed with the high confidence

level displayed by GHS. “The band plays with confidence,” 
wrote one judge on the critique form. “Keep working and 
listening to your director. He is coaching you well.” Another 
said, “Band plays with good confidence - so important.” 

Both the adjudicators and the director were appreciative of 
the support shown by the band’s many followers, who watched 
the 10:50 a.m. performance at Roscommon High School on 
Saturday. “Wow,” wrote one judge in his comments, “How 
nice to have the home town folks here.” 

Mr. Ormsbee extended “a big thanks to the supporters at 
Roscommon, Jt was just super to sce (them) there. The 
applause was much appreciated.” 

Perhaps one judge’s final comments best summarize the 
band’s experience at the 1990 State Festival and the response 
of its supporters when he wrote: “Fine band - good training, 
careful preparation, Congratulations.” 


GHS BAND IS SUPERIOR--The Grayling High School Band received its best ever rating at the state band festival.

Twp. Planning Commission, Fair Board Split on Zoning Issue 


Leasing the Crawford 
County Fairgrounds to a pipe- 
line construction company has 
caused problems between the 
Grayling Twp. Planning Com- 
mission and the Crawford 
County Fair Board. 

The Grayling Township 
Planning Commission voted 
unanimously on Tuesday, 
Aprit 24, to suspend the 
Crawford County Fair Board’s 
conditional use permit, They 
vited four violations of the con- 
ditional use permit including 
leasing the fairground prop- 
erly for a contractor’s yard 
without requesting permission 
from the Township Planning 
Commission, the installation 
of a “moto-cross” type track 
on the premises without sepa- 
rate prior approval of the plan- 
ning commission, as required, 
failure to plant trees, which 
the Fair Board promised to do 
by May, 1989, and failure to 
remove stumps and brush as 
promised in 1989. 

The Fair Board was noti- 
fied by Township Supervisor 
Arnold Stancil ina letter, dated 
March 27, 1990, that it was in 
violation of its conditional use 
permit, The letter informed 
the board that the township 
had received several com- 
plaints from residents living 
near the fairgrounds claiming 
it was an unsightly mess. The 
Ictter further stated the town- 
ship Planning Commission 
would be holding its annual 
review of the Fair Board’s use 
permiton April 24th and asked 
thatarcpresentative of the Fair 
Board be present. 

Noone from the Fair Board 
was able to attend the meet- 


ing. 


After the Planning Com- 
mission took action April 24, 
the Fair Board met Sunday, 
April 29, and asked someone 
from the township to attend. 
Noone from the township was 
able to. 

Concerning leasing the 
property during the off sea- 
son, the Fair Board said there 
is nothing in their conditional 
use permit or public use deed 
from the state of Michigan 
that prevents them from using 
the land to earn money for the 
benefit of the fair. The 
Crawford County Board of 
Commissioners, who hold the 
deed to the land, were in- 
formed of the lease agreement 
with Welded Construction in 
October and gave their ap- 
proval by an unanimous vote 
7-0 to lease the fairgrounds 
for ten months. 

Fair Board Member Tom 
Davis said the Fair Board did 
notify the Planning Commis- 
sion prior to the construction 
of the moto-cross_ track and 
had received permission to 
proceed with the project. 

Fair Board Member Rick 
Davis said 110 trees were 
planted last fall. He said the 
trees ranged from three to four 
fect in height. 

Stump and brush removal, 
explained Davis, is & costly 
and timeconsuming business. 

“Our only revenue is the $1 
fair admission and our per- 
centage of the carnival,” said 
Davis. “We are working at it 
as best we can,” 

Datis said Duane Brooks 
and a crew from Camp 
Lehman have burned some of 
the stumpsand brush, and they 
are now waiting for permis-

sion from the DNR to bury the 
ash. 

When asked about the un- 
secured moto-cross track and 
contractor’s yard, the Fair 
Board stated that nearly every 
year the fairground has suf- 
feredsome type of vandalism, 
This year with Welded Con- 
struction on the premises, they 
said there was no vandalism, 

Davis said the Fair Board 
was working towards build- 
ing a year round facility on the 
40acre fairgrounds with Little 
League fields, two soccer 
fields, and possibly an ice 
skating rink during the win- 
ter. He said the $5,000 the 
Fair Board received by lcas- 
ing the land will help them 
achieve these goals. 

The Fair Board said they 
are attempting to comply with 
their conditional use permit 
with Grayling Township, 

“The township has been 
lenient with the Fair Board 
because they are a group of 
volunteers involved in acom- 
munity effort with very littic 
money,” said Stancil. “But 
we also have the responsibil- 
ity toprotect the health, safety, 
and welfare of the township’s 
tesidents.” 

Stancil said if the Fair 
Board would have asked him 
whether they could usc the 
property for a contractor’s 
yard he would have told them 
no and would have suggested 
they go to the Planning Com- 
mission and see if they would 
approve that use of the land. 

“They didn’t do that,” he 
said, 

Using the fairground fora 
contractor’s yard not only 
violates the Fair Board's usc 
permit, explained Stancil, but 
it also violates zoning regula- 
tions for the area, He said the 
area is zoned commercial one 
for the first 400 feet back from 
Old 27 and recreational forest 
for the land behind the front- 


ing property. 

Stancil said he was con- 
cerned that the unfenced moto- 
cross track and unsecured 
contractor's yard could becon- 
sidered an attractive nuisance 
opening the county for law 
Suits should someone be in- 
jured while using the track or 
Climbing on the equipment. 

If the Fair Board took steps 
to get the equipment off the 
fairgrounds immediatcly, 
Stancil said the township 
would be more than willing to 
work with the Fair Board to 
straighten out the remainder 
of the violations. 


Mr. John Roberts and Bob 
Seebeck from Welded Con- 
struction of Perrysburg, Ohio, 
were also present at the Sun- 
day Fair Board mecting. 
Seebeck said MTT Environ- 
mental Services, an environ- 
mental consulting firm from 
Mt. Pleasant, was hired to 
make recommendations and 
oversee the clean-up of the oil 
and diesel fuel spills that had 
occurred on the fairgrounds 
property over the winter 
months while Welded Con- 
struction has leased the prop- 
erty, 

Seebeck said the biggest 
spill occurred on a 750 sq. ft. 
area near the front of the pole 
building. He said Jack Mil- 
likin was hired to remove the 
soil and take it to the Char- 
levoix Land Fill. Millikin’s 
dug down about 4 1/2 fect 
until they hit water. Soil and 
water samples were taken 
from the area, Scebeck said 
results of the soil samples are 
not back yct, but he said water 
sample test results showed no 
contamination. 

Plastic sheeting had been 
laid on the ground where their 
vehicles filled their gas tanks 
in an effort to prevent con- 
tamination, but Roberts ex- 
plained that the plastic was

Welded Construction began 
using the fairground property 
Jast November, In addition to

Fair Board for leasing thearca,

On May 21, 1986, the state 
of Michigan deeded the prop- 
erty known as the Crawford 
County Fairgrounds to the 
Crawford County for one dol- 
lar with the stipulation that 
when the property is no longer 
needed by the county for a 
fairgrounds, the title will re- 
vert to the state: The county 


thenentered intoan agreement 
with the Fair Association for 
use of the property. 

Roland Harmes, Jr., Chicf 
of the DNR Land Division, 
said the fairground land has a 
public use deed, and in his 
opinion, any money derived 
from the land belongs to the 
state of Michigan. He said he 
was taking the matter to the 
Attorney General’s office for 
an opinion, 

“It didn’t look proper, so 
we brought it to the county’s 
attention,” he said. “We are 
now trying to work with the 
County Fair Board to get the 
problem resolved. | believe 
common sense will prevail.” 

The Fair Board disagrees 
with the DNR'’s interpretation 
of the deed and a meeting had 
been set up with the Fair Board,

but the state cancelled and the 
Fair Board heard no more from 
the state untit the DNR con- 
tacted the county regarding the

Linda Stephans, chairper- 
son of the Grayling Township 
Planning Commission, said the 
Fair Board has repeatedly ig- 
nored the conditions set forth 
in the use permitand has failed 
to meet with the planning 
commission despite several 
opportunities. Stcphans said 
the Fair Board has to conform 
to its conditional use permit 
and that does not include leas- 
ing the land for a contractor's 
yard. She said zoning laws and 
conditional use permits exist 
for safety reasons and to pro-

The Crawford County Fair Board is made up entircly 
of volunteers from this community, many who have 
helped develop the Fair into a success from its birth 8 
years ago. These volunteers have built a bright future for 
the fairgrounds. Soccer and baseball fields for area youth 
will soon be added to the fairgrounds, and the 1990 Fair, 
set for July 18-21, is also looking to be the best Fair so far. 


The Crawford County Fair is well received by the com- 
munity and by many businesses. The Crawford County 
Avalanche, for example, has becn a supporter of the Fair 
since its start. Over the years, we've donated tickets, 
advertised in the premium book, helped print the pre- 
mium book, and donated full page ads promoting events 
at the Fair, We've published news storics explaining the 
Fair Board’s Master Plan for the fairgrounds and we've 
ran several picture pages highlighting Fair activities. 
This year, we’re donating supplics and the use of our 
Macintosh computers for Fair publicity and designing 
ads for the premium book. Other local businesses have 
also been supporting the Fair right from its beginning. 


The Grayling Township Planning Commission, like 
the County Fair Board, is also made up of civic-minded 
community members. Their duties often put them in the 
middie of zoning issues that are difficult and emotional. 
Both sides in a dispute want it their way and have good, 
sound reasons for feeling that way. I was in the middle of 
many zoning disputes when I used to serve on both the 
county and township planning commissions. 


At the center of a current zoning issue is the question 
of the county fairgrounds being leased to Welded Con- 
struction, of Perryburg, Ohio, for ten months. 

The fairgrounds is turrently nat being used most of the 
ycar and the site was practical for the company. Inreturn 
for using the fairgrounds to store their equipment, the 
company is paying a total of $5,000 in rent. Anyone who 
has ever worked on a non-profit organization in this 
county wilt know how important a contribution like this 
can be. The company also agrecd to perform some field 
construction work for the fairgrounds, [ts presence at the 
fairgrounds also stopped a vandalism problem that had 
hit some fairground buildings in years past. 


The company's presence, however, was also noticed 
by neighbors who questioned why the company could 
use an arca not zoned for heavy commercial usc. The 
company also had some small gasoline spills at the 
fairgrounds over the winter, which it says are now cleaned 
up. (An article on page 3 has details on this and other 
items.) 


The central issue still seems to be the Icasing of the 
fairgrounds to this construction company. There is no 
way around the fact that there are local people on both 
sides — yes, it’s okay to lease; no, it isn’t, 


People may be split on this issue but it should be con- 
sidered that there are good folks involved on both sides, 
people who care about what’s best for Crawford County. 


I’m looking for the two boards to get together soon and 
work something out. It might not be easy but it’s an issuc 
that needs to be ironed out so the Fair Board and the 
Township Planning Commission can return to achieving 
both their goals: a fairgrounds that is the best we can

Reader Challenges Taxpayers 
To Question Commissioners’ Actions 


This Ictter is written as a 
challenge to every taxpayer in 
this county to scrutinize and 
question their county commis- 
stoners about the actions that 
were taken al their meeting of 
4/26/90, relative to the in- 
crease in state equalized value. 


I have always considered 
myself as a supporter of my 
community, I have paid my 
taxes, supported every single 
educational millage, as part of 
my responsibility, but the 
manner in which the vote for 
an increase in state equalized 
value was handled, should 
make every taxpayer as angry 
and frustrated as I felt, when I 


realized that the sequence of 
events allowed for no con- 
stituent input, and in fact was 
not publicized until the after- 
noon before the scheduled 
meeting. The article appeared 
in the Avalanche, which was 
distributed Wednesday after- 
noon - how many people actu- 
ally get and read their paper 
the first day of publication? 
There is no reason why this 
could not have been released 
the previous weck. It also 
comes on the heels of a land 
value increase in January. 

i have never belonged to a 
cilizen’s tax organization. I 
have always considered them 
10 be too right wing, but after 


this travesty [ believe that I 
will seriously consider that 
opuon. 

[ would challenge cach 
reader to ask the following 
questions: 


Why was this proposat not 
publicized in time for con- 
stituent input? 

How did your county com- 
missioner vote? (The vote was 
five for, two against.) 

Where was your township 
supervisor? Did they repre- 
sent you, and at Icast suggest 
the proposal be tabled until 
they could assess voter reac- 
tion? 

Recognizing that the actions 


taken were within the author- 
ity of the commission, I feel 
that it shows a total lack of 
concern for the inevitable 
reactions that would occur. 
We are, after atl, “We the 
People,” and this proposal was 
more than just normal busi- 
ness which the commission 
confronts each month. It was 
more than just the perfunctory 
nassage of county administra- 
tive issues. If youdo not speak 
out, make no mistake, this will 
happen again! 

Remember, your county 
commissioner did have a 
choice.

Chamber Interested In Developing 
N. Down River — I-75 Exchange 


To Mr, William L. Carey, 
Atty.: 

The Grayling Regional 
Chamber of Commerce ap- 
preciates your most recent 
“Letter to the Editor” which 
appeared in the Crawford 
County Avalanche on Wed- 
nesday, April 11, 1990. It 
seems obvious that if you have 
questions, being a local busi- 
ness professional, than others 
in the community may also be 
unaware of the issues behind 
the Chamber's interest in 
developing the existing North 


Down River Road Exit Ramp 
# 256. 

In your letter you addressed 
two key points: 

!. Why a North bound exit 
ramp from 1-75 to North Down 
River Road would not ade- 
quately address the problem 
of routing North bound mili- 
tary traffic headed to MATES 
past the city proper of Gray- 
ling? 

The fact of the matter is that 
a full exchange is the only 
option to be considered with 
the Michigan Department of 


Transportation. It was made 
very clear during the Cham- 
ber meeting with MDOT rep- 
resentative Mr. Hartwig that 
the State is not interested in 
funding a “partial exchange 
project.” 

A major concern is, that by 
constructing a partial ex- 
change (ie: anorth bound ramp 
onto North Down River Road) 
you do not resolve the other 
issucs such as: alleviating 
delivery trucking to the com- 
mercial businesses and con- 
tractors that are located off 


More Than 100 Volunteers 
Have Helped River House 


Letter to the Editor: 

As a Volunteer Coordina- 
tor for River House Shelter 
since 1986, | have worked 
with well over 100 volunteers. 
The reasons they volunteered 
varied; some were former vic- 
tims or knew the victims per- 
sonally; some needed work 
experience or were fulfilling 
college credit requirements, 
while others only wanted to 
do something to help. 


Each volunteer has their 
own story to tefl and every 
voluntecr is special. All of the 
River House Volunteers have 
something in common; they 
have given of themselves and 
asked litle inretum. Although 
the volunteers say that their 
rewards arc found in the smile 
of a child or a hug from a 
shelter resident, we at River 
House feel they deserve pub- 
lic recognition.

Almanac 


By Richard Milliman 


It’s hard 


Each year one week in the 
month of April is designated 
“National Volunteer Recog- 
nition Week.” This year River 
House Shelter hosted a volun- 
teer recognition luncheon at 
the Ralph MacMullen Con- 
ference Center to honor the 
many individuals who have 
supported the shelter through 
the volunteer program. 


The River House volunteer 
program includes individuals 
from the four counties we 
serve (Crawford, Oscoda, 
Ogemaw, and Roscommon), 
as well as voluntecrs from the 
Department of Social Serv- 
ices, R.S.V.P., Foster Grand- 
parents, and the young men 
from Shawono Center. 

The staff of River House 
Shelter is thankful for every 
individual who has helped 
make someone else’s world a 
little better by giving of them- 
self through the River House 
Shelter program during these 
past three years.

North Down River Road (ic: 
Millikin, Georgia Pacific, 
Weyerhacuser, Carlisle 
Paddle Co., Consumers 
Power, CSI, Car Dealers and 
Fic.). 

Currently this traffic is 
routed via I-75 business loop - 
an important safety issue. The 
goal is to alleviate the alrcady 
congested I-75 business loop 
- which is nearing capacity 
traffic flow (especially during 
the peak summer months) and 
finally, equally important , is 
the effort to provide a more 
fluid path of travel for the 
increasing number of tourists 
to the Grayling Area ~~ again 
a very important safety issuc 
based on the confusion and 
aggravation Grayling's two 
existing partial exchanges 
cause Our guests. 

2. Why doesn’t the military 
utilize the Military Road exit 
and the Four Mile Road exit 
on all traffic coming to and 
from Camp Grayling to 1-75? 

In reality Bill, they do. 
However, the larger vehicics 
and troops heading to the 
MATES facility, east of Gray- 
ling, account for the majority 
of military traffic routed di- 
rectly through town, Which is 
precisely the justification 
behind the need for a North 
Bound exit on to North Down 
River Road as mentioned in 
your previous question. 

On behalf of the Board of 
Directors we certainly hope 
these explanations have an- 
swered your - and others - 
questions. If there are others 
in the community that have 
specific questions about the 
proposed North Down River 
Road Exchange please con- 
tact the Chamber Office, #348- 
2921 and ask for Skip, Trans- 
portation Committee Chair- 
man, or myself,

YES, IT MUST BE hard to be humble — difficult, but 


not impossible. 


Let's Talk About It 
IR RS 


to be humble 


BIG TIME SPORTS these days is big business. 
Latest witness to that claim is acollege junior named Jeff 
Gcorge, who will be paid some $15 million over the next 
six ycars to play football —- or sit on the bench — for the 
Indianapolis Colts of the National Footbalt League. 

Mr. George, who has been around the Big Ten for 
several ycars, has not even finished college, yet he 
commands huge sums for latent talents and promise. 


That's notunusual. Jeff George is only the latest multi- 
millionaire who has profited from America’s system of 
big time athletics, Don Mattingly and Mark Langston of 
bascbail, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan of basket- 
ball, Troy Aikman and Barry Sanders of football, plus 
others in hockey, golf, tenn , boxing -— the woods arc 
full of them, 

Tt must be tough to be humble when you're hauling 
down megabucks playing games, A basketballer named 
Charles Barkley is a case in point. After instigating a 
huge free-for-all during a Philadelphia 76ers and Detroit 
Pistons game recently, Mr. Barkley faced penalty with 
equanimity. What real difference did it make, he rea- 
soned, to face a few thousand dollars for a fine when he’s 
paid some $3 million a year So what? 


There's Orel Hershiser, the pitching ace for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, who a year ago was the highest paid 
professional baseball player, after he signed for $7.9 
million for three seasons. Since then, of course, Mark 
Langston and Don Mattingly and others have passed that 
mark by huge sums. 

“The arena around me has changed, so people perceive 
that }’m changing; but} don’t know if anything changed 
after the contract,” Mr. Hershiser said at the time. 

“I’m making a really solid, conscious effort not to 
change. I want to remember the place ] came from — my 
roots.” 

“It’s crazy. Ecan’tcomprehend that kind of money. It 
becomes numbers ona piece of paper. You can only drive 
one car, live in onc house, cat one meal at a lime. After 
that, your savings account just gets bigger.” 

Let’s hope Orel Hershiscr maintains those attitudes. 

e * * 

AND THERE’S RICKY BIRDSONG, baskctball 
coach at University of Detroit, who has filled two years 
of a four year contract, Mr. Birdsong is trying to lead 
Detroit back to basketball respectability, with modest but 
promising results so far. 

University of Arkansas at Little Rock came calling on 
Mr. Birdsong. Looking for a new coach, Arkansas 
dangled a huge compensation increase, and other entice- 
ments, At U, of D., Mr. Birdsong is paid about $65,000 
aycar; the Little Rock package was worth about $125,000. 


ALL ABOUT TOWN 


By Joe Murphy 


It looks like old man winter has finally released its 
grasp. It sure seems nice to be greeted by sunny skics and 
warm breezes. The grass is greening up, those trees that 
had looked dead are showing signs of life. Soon our eyes 
can feast on the beauty of flowers and our noses will 
detect the perfume of their blooms. Spring is such a 
beautiful lime of year, it’s like payment for enduring the 
long cold winter. It’s wonderful to just be able to stroll 
around town without all the paraphernalia we had to wear 
all winter, Soon folks will be saying they wish it would 
cool off. I guess man is never satisfied with things as they 
are, but always wishes for some thing different. Just 
human nature I guess. 

I hope by the time this appears in the paper I’ve had a 
meal or two of brook trout and stuffed myself with those 
good morel mushrooms, I’m hoping that the woods wil] 
be full of them this year, Could be, as this is more the kind 
of spring I remember as being good for them. The past 
few years things were too dry and wood's growth well 
started before mushroom time. This year with things 
being held back by cold weather, might be just what we 
necded, 

With the nice weather we have in store for us now, | 
hope to get out and do some exploring, finding some of 
the old town sites and places I’ ve heard of but have never 
seen. Even places I once knew have now changed so 
much it’s like you never saw them before. Today I visited 
the old dam near Frederic. Asa kid I spent a lot of time 
there. At that time the Frederic Sportsman Club did a lot 
of work rebuilding the dam, putting in a wooden bridge 
and even a diving board in the deeper water above the 
dam. Ona large boulder they had placed a bronze plate 
dedicated to Rube Babbit, our first Game Warden and his 
contributions to the cause of conservation. Vandals of 
course had to steal that bronze plate in a short time and the 
Frederic Sportsmen Club died out over the years. Bill 
Leng had been one of the men who devoted time and 
effort to try tokeep the club going. When Bill died there 
seemed to be no one to take his place and the club dried 
up. Today there is hardly a sign of their efforts at the old 
dam. Even the old river bed has changed. It was like | 
had never seen it before. As I say, the times keep 
a’changing. 

The original dam there had been to form a mill pond for 
the lumber mill that once was a real going thing. The jack 
pine plantations there cover what once was a thriving 
community, Milltown at onc time was a community of 
the workers of the old mill. Many folks still have pleasant 
memories of their childhood spent there. 


The temptation was strong, but the Detroit coach said 
“no, thanks.” Why? 

“The bottom line was I’d be walking out on a job and 
I didn’t want that,” said Mr. Birdsong. “It got down toa 
thing like signing a kid a week ago and going back to tell 
that kid I’m leaving... That seemed a little bit deceitful to 
me....” 

“I promised these players I’d coach them, and you’ve 
got to do what you say you're going to do. I’m young 
enough that money can’t be the issue right now... There 
are bigger things now.” 

In my book, one of those bigger things is Ricky 
Birdsong’s stature, 

* * * 

ONE MORE EXAMPLE — Blair Bush, a center for 
football’s Green Bay Packers, has asked to renegotiate 
his contract with the Packers, not unusual in professional 
sports for players who try to get as much money as they 
can while the getting is good. 

But Blair Bush wants to lower his salary. At33, he has 
been in the league for 12 years, and wants to slow down. 
He said he wants to play less next season and figured it 
was only fair that he receive a smaller paycheck. Mr. 
Bush is duc to receive $400,000 in base pay next season. 

It’s still up in the air what will happen between Mr. 
Bush and the Packers, There’s precious little precedent 
to follow in such negotiations, But Blair Bush deserves 
lots of credit; his attitude is commendable. 

Let’s hope Jeff George and other emerging athletic 
millionaires become more of a Birdsong or a Bush than 
a Barkley.

West, agrced with Sicphan’s summary, stating that suc- 
cesses on the opening weekend appearcd to be hit or miss 
onthe rivers, put said bait fishing on the lakes was “wild.” 

Walleyes and northern pike were being caught with 
minnows on Lake Margrethe and Skip said Blue Gills 
were abundant in the shallows and were caught with flies 
and bait. He said fishermen werc using minnows tocatch 
walleyes and croppics on Manistee Lake and there was 
good trolling on Bear Lake for brown trout. 

“Generally, fishermen on the rivers made some nice 
catches during Hendrickson hatches,” he said, “but un- 
fortunately the hatches were short lived, only 45 minutes 
or so.” 

One pair of fishermen from Miland, south of Ann 
Arbor, who waded from Burtons Landing to Keystone 
catching three or four brookies ina cloud of Hendricksons, 
stated it was probably the best opener they had fished in 
several years. They were staying in the area to fish until 
Wednesday.

he did not sce another fisherman and that while he was 
working in the front of his cottage repairing his well, he 
had not scen a single riverboat or canoe of fishermen go 
by. 

Bob Smock was unable to fish opening: sveekend, but 
said a couple fishermen from Wa Wa Sum came into his 
shop for flies and said they had caughtand released TT or 
12 fish, 

According to Smock, most hatches occurred between 
Burtons Landing and Stephans Bridge. He said it sounded 
like a half-way decent opener with most fish causht 
during Hendrickson hatches. 

Despite the beautiful weather with sunny skies and 
temperatures reaching into the 80's, DNR Officer Patnick 
satd he did not see the numbers of pcople usually here for 
the trout opencr. He said he could nol explain why. 

Patrick said there were some good hatcheson the South 
Branch and the Mason Track and fishermen there did 
“reasonably well,” 

On the mainstream, he said the quality waters were 
heavily used, but there was only light pressure on the 
remaining stretches of the river. 

Bait fishing, especially around the Deward area, lacked 
the expected opening day pressure as well, and Patrick 
said for the most part, fishermen did not do well there 
cither. 

Patrick summed up the weckend by saying, “If you 
were in the right spot at the right time, you caught fish, uf

- Michigan United Conserva- 
tion Clubs (MUCC), 

Published in the premier 
issic Of Tucbor Terra, 
MUCC’s new, bimonthly, 48- 
page environmental maga- 
zine, the FQ Index pointed to 
improvements in four of the 
seven categories analyzed, 
including a two-point gain in 
Wildlife, and one-point gains 
inthe categories of Outdoor 
Recreation, Fish, and Energy. 

Particularly disturbing was 
the establishment of a record 
low rating in the category of 
Lands and Forests, which 
dropped two points. In addi- 
tion, the FQ Index noted a 
decline of two points in the 
state's Water quality, and a 
drop of one point in Air qual- 
ity, 

“1989 was nol a good year 
for the management of our 
state's natural resources or the 
restoration of our state's envi- 
ronmental quality,” declared 
Thomas L. Washington, 
MUCC excculive director. 
“The downward trend we've 
noted in some of these catego- 
rics in recent years should 
sound a distressing alarm to 
Michtgan’s citizens.” 

The four categories which 
registered gains in 1989 in- 
clude: 

*Wildlife—posted a gain 
of two points, giving it a rat- 
ing of 80 out ofa possible 100. 
Notable improvements in 
wildlife habitat, coupled with 
improved populations of 
nongame species, contributed 
to the gains in this category. 

*Fisheries-—increased one 
point, from 78 to 79, out of a 
possible 100. Despite prob- 
lems with the salmonid fish- 
ery and the continued inva- 
sion of exotic species into the 
Great Lakes, significant gains 
in the walleye fishery and 


promising initiatives by the 


Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources Fisheries 
Division combined to end the 
1980s on an upswing. 

*Energy—increascd one 
point, from 47 to 48, to cstab- 
lish a record high in the cate- 
gory for the decade. Renewed 
citizen concem about personal 
energy usage, coupled with 
the increased use of recycled 
materials in the manufacture 
of consumer goods, contrib- 
vied to the slight gain in this 
category. 

*Outdoor Recreation— 
registered a gain of one point 
from 85 to 86, due primarily 
to the restoration of state and 
local park systems under the 
“Quality of Life” bonding 
program, 

Three categories measured 


I by the EQ Index registered 
f declines in $989, including: 


*Water dropped two 
points toa score of 71, due 
principally to heightened 


1 problems with combined 


sewer overflows, continued 
loss of critical wetlands, and 


B ili-cntorced state water qual- 


ily standards. 

*Lands and Forests— 
declined two points to61 , thus 
establishing a record low for 
this category, Unbridled 
development in key urban

areas, the failure of the DNR 
lo quickly develop state forest 
management plans, and the 
dwindling supply of wetlands 
contributed to the downward 
trend in this important cate- 
gOrY. 

*Air---reccived a rating of 
72, downone point from 1988, 
due to increases in acid rain 
and continucd problems with 
emissions from the state's 
municipal trash incinerators. 

Data used in determining 
the FQ Index ratings are pro- 
vided by authorities on the 
environment and natural re- 
sources in both the public and 
private sectors. The data are 
evaluated by members of the 
MUCC resource manage- 
ment, environmental protec- 
tion, and education staffs who 
prepare individual reports on 
the seven categories, 

Single copics of the EQ 
Index are available by writ-

1 Am With You Always 
To those I love and those who 
love me. When { am gone, 
release me, let me go, I have 
so many things to sec and do, 
You mustn’t tic yourself to 
me with tears, Be happy that 
we had so many ycars. 

I] gave you my love, you can 
only guess, How much you 
gave me in happiness, [ thank 
you for the love you each have 
shown, 

But now itstime I travel alone, 
So grieve for a while if grieve 
youmust, Then let your grief 
comforted by trust. 

It’s only for a while that we 
must part, so bless the memo- 
rics within your heart. [won't 
be far away, for life goes on, 
So if you need me, call and 1 
will come. 

Tough you can’t see or touch 
me, I'll be near. And if you 
listen with your heart, all of 
my love around you, soft and 
clear, 

And then when you mustcome 
this way alone, I'll greet you 
with a smile and “Welcome 
Home”.

Resource Review 


By Bruce Patrick, 
Conservation Oficer 
In any one place the popu- 
lations of different plants and 
animals are interrelated to 
constitute a biotic community 
or ecosystem. Each member 
in the population has its ups 
and downs, and their changes 
effect other parts of the com- 
munity, Some communities - 
a pond, river, or a fallen tog - 
are easy to visualize and de- 
fine, but others such as a lake 
shore or ocean beach may 
merge with adjacent commu- 
nities. Some large, free rang- 


ing animals such as coyotes 
and deer may have their head- 
quarters in one kind of com- 
munily but often make use of 
others. 

The edge, or place where 
communities meet and merge, 
isa mixture of organisms from 
both communities and is ex- 
lensively used by many ani- 
mals, 

Any community is a rather 
self-contained organic unit, 
with plants and animals living 
together in an interdependent 


manner, As tn a human com- 
munity these members are 
specialized and have certain 
“jobs”, producers, consumers 
and decomposers - and are 
organized into acomplex food 
web. 

Larger communities of both 
land and water exhibit stratift- 
cation, A forest has charac- 
teristic animals of the tree- 
tops, lower branches, bark, 
leaf litter, and soil. A lake or 
pond has surface dwellers, 
others in intermediate depths 


HO-HUM--'It gets mighty boring just sitting around waiting for someone 


tocome to the Crawford County Animal Shelter looking for a puppy, like me. 
The shelter is open Monday through Friday from 1-3 p.m. and on weekends 
from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Why don't you come to the shelter for a visit? If 
you don’t want me, there are plenty of other puppies to catch your fancy."

and bottom dwellers, 

In any community one or a 
few species are dominant over 
others and can control other 
inhabitants. For example, ina 
pine forest, the pine tree is 
dominant and through shad- 
ing and production of anacidic 
leaf carpet limits the growth 
of other plants. Because other 
planis are absent, only those 
animals adapted to living ina 
pine community are in resi- 
dence. 


Doodles from 
the Tall Timber 

Le 
by Wendall Hoover 


I will remind you again 
before the 17th of May, but 
for now this is an invitation 
that I hope you will mark on 
your calendar. The Friends of 
the Hartwick Pines will be 
gathering at 7:30 p.m., that 
evening, for a walk through 
the Pines. Oh, I know you 
have taken the walk before, 
bul the return trip from the 
logging camp will be guided 
by the light from a kerosene 
lantern, (no flashlights please) 
and that makes it different. 

Some of my job revolves 
atound magic and secrets 
which | would like very much 
to share with you. There aren't 
any slights of hand involved, 
only the secrets the Pines wish 
to share. Some of the magic 
you will bring and some of the 
secrets you will discover with- 
out any help from me. 

It will be a leisurely walk, 
so you do not have to wear 
your running shoes, but it may 
be cool, so wear something 
comfortable. By the way, you 
don’t have to be a member of 
the Friends group to join us. 
This is an open invitation and 
the secrets aren’t X-rated, so 
bring the kids. The Pines are 
just spooky enough at night to 
make things interesting, so 
why not join us? 


We will recognize Mrs. 
Margaret Fenton who is retir- 
ing this year after 32 years 
here in our Grayling Schools. 
I would say she has been one 
of our favorite teachers. We 
could almost call her an hon- 
orary member of our Alumni, 
since her husband, Elmer, is 
of the class of °29, and her 
daughters have all graduated 
here, Carol ’60, Donna ’63, 
(Roy Milnes Award) and 
Nancy 66. 

A group of 29 parents and 
teachers at a combined pot- 
luck dinner and meeting 
Monday evening, April 24, 
decided to disband the 
Crawford-AuSable PTA, bya 
vote of 12 to 8 on a secret 
ballot. The vote came as a 
climax to discussions over a 
period of months on ways to 
improve altendance. Some 
reluctance to taking the ex- 
treme step was expressed but 


_it was not strong cnough to 


overbalance the apparent lack 
of interest. It was ironic that 
the disbandment followed a 
treasurer’s report showing the 
PTA Fun Festival had netted 
$602.73 profit, according to 
preliminary reports. No ac- 
tion was taken on disposal of 
funds at this time. 


46 Years Ago. 
May 4, 1944 

Once of the most intcresting 
stories we've heard inacoon’s 
age is one with the Manistee 
River as the locale: A group 
guided by Fred Bromwell 
from the Arrowhead really 
meant business. Rolly 
McClain of Houghton Lake 
hauled ina 9-tb. rainbow trout 
with the help of another man. 
His sister, Bertha Dannenberg, 
who had never gone a-fishing 
landed a 6 Ibs. rainbow trout. 
Two other rainbow were 
caught which weighed 5 Ibs. 
each, 

Robert Bugby, son of Mr. 
and Mrs. Eggic Bugby landed 
a 22-inch rainbow that 
weighed § pounds; he was 
fishing in the East Branch.

THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS 


There are some very special people 
That have needs the same as you and | 
Winning or losing is not Important 

All they ask is a chance to try 


The Special Olympics gives them their chance 
To enjoy thelr moment in the sun 

In happy competition with others 

As they show how they can jump and run 


Here they learn the joy of 
As they proudly claim thei 
With a proud, happy look 


victory 
1 prize 
on their faces 


And a look of great joy in their eyes 


They have so little to bring 


them joy 


That to deny them this pleasure would be a shame 
So let's support the Special Olympics 


And give them oa chance 


at fame 


The look of joy upon their face 


As they share in all the fun 


Is pay enough for all our effort 
And the hard work we have done 


Anyone who helps in any way 

To make the Special Olympics go 

Wins a lot of love and affection 

From these special folks that let if show 


Animal 


are Tip 


Thinking about getting a pet 


the United States suggests that you keep the following in mind: 


Make sure you're ready, wi 


lling and able to take on the 


commitment. Having a dog is fun, but it’s also aresponsibility. 
Buying a purebred? Inspect the kennel and meet your 
prospective pet's parents. Make certain your puppy was raised 
properly and in humane surroundings. 
Try to buy from a local breeder. You'll probably pay less 


because there’s no middleman. 


Also you can see for yourself 


that your chosen dog hasn’t come from an inhumane “puppy 
mill,” a mass breeding farm in which adult dogs live in misery 


as puppy-producing machines. 


If you don’t need a purebred, the local animal shelter always 


has many homeless animals up 
puppies that strongly resemble 
AKC breed. 


a 20-inch brown trout, one 
about 16 inches and several 
smaller brook trout. Several 
other Ikes up there caught the 
limit (15) the first day. 

Fred Bromwell, fishing in 
the Big Manistee, landed five 
rainbow troul, the aggregate 
weight of which was 19 
pounds. 

Buddy Homing, son of Mr. 
and Mrs. Oscar Horning, 
showed up the other kids Sat- 
urday by landing t4 brook 
trout, none under 8 inches in 
length. This same youngster 
landed a 5-pound brown trout 
from the AuSable last sum- 
mer, 

Jerry Jo Smock, age 14, son 
of Mr. and Mrs. Liland Smock, 
was the champion fisherman 


of the neighborhood on the 


opening day. He came home 
with nine nice ones caught in 
the AuSable not far from his 
home. 

The Grayling Ladies’ 
Bowling League and their 
sponsors closed a successful 
year by celebrating with a 
banquet at Shoppenagons Inn 
last Monday evening. Mrs. 
Iva Jarmin, president of the 
Ladies League, introduced 
eachteam sponsor presentand 
then Mrs. Erma Burtch, secre- 
tary of the league, who pre- 
sented the prizes to the vani- 
ous teams and individuals. 
Placement prizes, Hanson’s 
Chevrolettes, Dorcttes, 
Sorenson’s Sporting Goods, 
Spike's Nailettcs, Porath’s, 
Grayling Bakery, Grayling 
Restaurant and Olsons. Indi- 
vidual high scores were Iva 
Jamin 215; Helen Langlois 
207; Bessic Peterson 198; 
Marguerite Bennett 193; Dena 
Hunter 188; Gladys Koerper 
183; Amy Gothro 178: Fem 
Akers 172; Rose Akers 172. 
The teams presented Mrs. 
Jannin and Mrs. Burtch with 
gifts in appreciation of the 
work they accomplished this 
year and both were re-elected 
to fill the same offices this 
coming year. 

Gold bars of a second heu- 
tenant were awarded Aviation 


Cadet Donald Charron, son of 


for adoption. Often, there are 
and have characteristics of an 


Mr. and Mrs. Albert Charron 
of Grayling at recent gradu- 
ation exercises of the Anny 
Air Forces Training Com- 
mand School at Yale Univer- 
sity, New Haven, Conn. Licut. 
Charron will be temporarily 
assigned to Ohmsted Field, 
Middletown, Pa. In the Army 
two years he entered Bomb- 
sight School in May, 1943 at 
Lowry Field, Colo. After 
completing the course in three 
months and graduating as 
bombsight maintenance man 
he was appointed an Aviation 
Cadet and sent to Goldsboro, 
N.C., for pre-technical train- 
ing before entering the school 
at Yale. 

Mr. and Mrs. Roy B. 
Conkling Sr., have purchased 
the William Ferguson house 
on Park Street and are getting 
settled in it. Mr. Conkling is 
employed in the Avalanche 
office. 

Sunday evening a group of 
young folks enjoyed a wiener 
roast along the AuSable River 
outside Frederic. Prior to the 
feed the boys defeated the girls 
in a game of soft ball. The 
affair was enjoyed by the fol- 
lowing: Marie MacQue of 
Auburn, Caroline Post, 
Ernestine and Beverly 
Stephan, Ted Stephan, home 
on furlough from Camp Ellis, 
[ll., Dick Dawson, Johnie 
Harmer, Bob Bigham and 
Linn Bindschatel. 

Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence 
Hunter are the proud parents 
ofa boy, born last Sunday. He 
has been named Lawrence

Introduction 


You remember that John’s 
gospel was“... written, that ye 
might delicve that Jesus is the 
Christ, the son of God; and 
that believing ye might have 
life through his name.” (John 
20:31). ‘The key verse of | 
John is I John 5:13: “These 
things have I written unty you 
that believe on the name of the 


Son of God; that ye may know

gion. True salvation is based 
upon the grace and mercy of 
God, while religions are based 
upon human merit and sacri- 
fice. 

We know that we know God 
by our relationship to His 
word, (I John 2:3-5), and His 
Spirit. ( John 4:13), “And 
we know that the Son of God 
is come, and hath given us an 
understanding, that we may 
know him that is true, and we 
are in him thal is true, even in 
his Son Jesus Christ. This is 
the true God, and eternal life.” 


From Calvary Baptist Church 


We know weare following (Hear “The Bible Speaks” 


the truth of God by the wit- 
ness of His Holy Spirit, (John 
2:20, 21); by our acceptance 
of the Bible, (IJohn 4:6, 3:19), 
and by answered prayers. (1 
John 5:15), 

We know we have assur- 


ance of salvation not only by { 


belicving the scriptures, (I 
John 5:13), but by our obedi- 
ence of the scriptures, (I John 
5:12), by our personal holi- 
ness of life, ({ John 5:18), and 
by our love of other such be-

word “know” is found dozens 
of times in I John and assures 
us as believers how we can 
have complete assurance con- 
cerning our relationship to 
God. Fundamental Bible 
Christianity is the truc salva- 
tion which can and docs make 
such claims, All other relig- 
ions promote a “think so”, 


izes those born into His fam- 
ily. (f John 2:29), We know 
that this righteous God came 
to take away our sins. (I John 
3:5). We know we dwell in 
Him and Hein us by His Spirit. 
(1 John 3:24), We can distin- 
guish the Spirit of God from 
the false spirits by acceptance 
or rejection of the incarnation 


an increase of antichrists, (I 
John 2:18). We know that we 
shall have a glorified body 
just like Jesus Christ at His 
return. (I John 3:2). 

We pray this introduction 
will encourage you to study I 
John with us to gain assurance 
in your Christian life of the 
many things God wants you

track of footprints in the sand. ! stop and listen. ILis perfectly 
quiet. But as [ took farther out to sea. the water is starting to 
swell until it can no longer contain itself A mighty wave

Again, all is quiet. | turn and walk back the way | came. 
My footprints are no longer there. | start over, leaving new

As a wave quietly builds, then crashes on the shore. 
wiping away old footprints, God's quiet strength can wipe 
away old mistakes and regrets. You can start anew. 

This week, worship God in prayer and meditation. In His 
Word, we are encouraged to...

businesses have also shown 
their support of Nurses Day. 

“With the continuation of a 
nationwide nursing shortage 
and the increasing demands 
for the, nursing services, 
members of our profession 
must be together in caring now 
more than ever,” said Noreen 
Davis, Vice President of Pa- 
ticnt Care Services and Op- 
erations at Mercy Hospital. 
“Astechnology hasincreased, 
so have the responsibilitics of 
nurses everywhere. [tis im- 
portant for people to under- 
stand that nurses today must 
have a unique combination of 
qualities: clinical knowledge, 
sound judgment, and the abil- 
ity to care.” 

Davis said that ANA and 
the state associations are 
working to combat the short- 
age and misperceptions about 
nurses. The Michigan Nurses’ 
Association, atong with ANA, 
has been a Ieader in identify- 
ing solutions to resolving the 
shortage, improving nurses’ 
salaries and working condi- 
tions, and providing a greater 
role for nurses in decision 
making processes. 

“With the financial support 
of nursing groups, The W.K, 
Kellogg Foundation, The Pew 
Charitable Trusts of Philadel- 
phia, and others, organized 
nursing, and The Advertising 
Council are increasing public 
awareness of the nursing pro- 
fession,” Davis said, “Todate, 
health care organizations have 
donated more than $425,000 
for the production of print and 
electronic advertisements.” 
The two-year, multimedia 
campaign is designed to com- 
bat the nursing shortage by 
raising public awareness of 
the value of nurses’ contribu- 
tions, enhancing the percep- 


tion of nursing as a desirable § 


career, and highlighting ca- 
reer Opportunities. 
“Wehaveevidence that this 


Z projectand our tocalcffarts to | 


recruit and retain nurses are 
making an impact mn our slate 


Bea and at Mercy Health Services 


North,” said Davis.
