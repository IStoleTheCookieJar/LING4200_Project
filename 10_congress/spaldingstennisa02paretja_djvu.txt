INTERNATIONAL  HONORS.  [ 

American  players  and  followers  of  the  game  of  lawn 
tennis  were  delighted  with  the  results  of  the  '97  season  of 
international  tennis,  inasmuch  as  American  players  won 
the  most  notable  victory  in  their  history.  The  popular 
idea  that  England's  fastest  players  were  a  trifle — at  least — 
in  the  lead  of  our  men  in  the  matter  of  playing  ability  was 
crushed;  and  that,  too,  in  the  face  of  rather  discouraging 
conditions.  Notwithstanding  that  of  recent  years  we  have 
had  perhaps  ten  first-class  players,  only  two  could  be  re- 
lied upon  to  play  this  season — Wrenn  and  Earned.  Last 
year  they  ranked  first  and  second.  When  the  season 
opened  the  outlook  was  anything  but  encouraging,  for 
Stevens  was  ill,  and  Hobart,  Hovey,  Neel  and  Chace,  for 
one  reason  or  another,  were  temporarily  shelved.  Whit- 
man, Wrenn,  Fischer  and  Collins  were^  the  best  available 
substitutes,  and  of  the  four  Whitman  only  scored  a  vic- 
tory, winning  from  Mahony  at  Newport;  Fischer  failed 
to  meet  any  of  the  visitors;  while  Collins  and  the  younger 
Wrenn  could  do  nothing  at  Hoboken  and  Chicago. 

The  visiting  team  was  representative  of  the  best  British 
skill — Eaves,  Mahony  and  Nisbet.  The  programme  for 
the  international  play  included  four  tournaments:  The 
Longwood  open  event;  an  international  team-against-team 
meeting  at  Hoboken;  a  "round-robin"  at  Chicago,  and  the 
Newport  championship.  Not  only  did  Wrenn  and  Earned 
save  the  championship,  but  the  Longwood  event  also.  For 
Great  Britain,  the  best  our  visitors  could  do  was  for  Eaves 
to  tie  for  second  at  the  Hoboken  invitation  meeting,  and 
lose  in  the  play  ofif;  while  Nisbet  tied  with  Wrenn  and 
Earned  for  first  at  Chicago. 


8  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

On  the  basis  of  the  records  of  the  five  men — Eaves,  Ma- 
honey,  Nisbet,  Wrenn  and  Larned — the  season  resulted  in 
twenty-three  matches;  the  Americans  won  fifteen  and  the 
Britishers  eight.  Of  the  twenty-three  matches,  eight  were 
not  international,  so  that  the  actual  result  was  thirteen 
victories  for  Wrenn  and  Larned  against  three  for  Eaves 
and  Nisbet.  These  s'tatistics  do  not  include  the  defeat  of 
Mahony  at  Newport  by  Whitman,  nor  the  two  defeats 
and  one  victory  recorded  for  the  visitors  in  doubles. 

Insomuch  as  the  matches  of  Collins  and  George  Wrenn 
are  omitted  from  calculation,  it  has  been  suggested  by  Mr. 
Paret  that  Nisbet's  matches  could  reasonably  be  held  out, 
but,  strange  enough,  his  score  saves  the  foreign  team  from 
complete  defeat.  Mahony  did  not  win  a  match  of  import- 
ance, but  even  were  his  scores  eliminated,  the  remaining 
scores  give  the  home  players  eight  victories  to  three  de- 
feats. Mahony's  failure  was  a  complete  surprise  and  was 
ascribed  to  lack  of  physical  endurance.  Nisbet's  unex- 
pected play  was  as  much  of  a  surprise  as  Mahony's  poor 
showing,  and  it  was  perhaps  the  distinguishing  feature  of 
the  visitors'  campaign. 

At  Longwood  Nisbet  upset  all  calculations  by  defeat- 
ing Eaves  in  three  straight  sets.  Besides  beating  Eaves 
twice  (against  one  defeat)  and  Mahony  once,  he  also  won 
a  match  each  from  Larned  and  Wrenn.  Eaves  and  Ma- 
hony could  not  beat  Larned,  and  Eaves  only  beat  Wrenn. 

Mr.  Paret  considers  Nisbet's  style  to  be  severe,  and  says: 
"He  hits  the  ball  from  the  top  of  its  bound  with  a  long, 
graceful,  free-armed  swing  that  drives  it  fast  and  deep  into 
his  opponent's  court.  When  in  his  best  streak  of  play,  he  is 
deadly  accurate  in  passing,  and  his  'length'  is  so  good  that 
it  is  almost  an  impossibility  to  get  to  the  net.  His  ser- 
vice, too,  is  the  fastest  and  most  difficult  to  score  from 
that  has  ever  been  seen  in  this  country,  and  he  is  won- 
derfully clever  in  underhand  volleying.  An  ofif  day  leaves 
him  as  hopeless  as  he  is  formidable  at  his  best.  He  plays 
so  close  to  the  net  and  so  deep  in  the  court  that  most  of  his 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  9 

Strokes  hit  the  net  or  fall  out  when  he  is  not  up  to  the 
mark." 

''Eaves,"  he  considers,  "had  not  the  speed  of  Nisbet  at 
any  time;  his  strokes  were  slower  and  he  rarely  showed 
good  length.  His  were  cross-court  passes,  too,  while  Nis- 
bet's  most  brilliant  passing  strokes  were  all  along  the  side 
lines.  Eaves  displayed  marvelous  command  of  the  ball 
and  steadiness  of  play.  With  an  awkward  and  compara- 
tively forehand  stroke,  he  seemed  somewhat  handicapped, 
but  when  one  played  against  it,  he  discovered  how  difficult 
it  was  to  determine  its  direction  before  it  left  the  racket. 
His  backhand  play,  however,  was  clear-cut  and  compara- 
tively free,  being  the  steadiest  and  most  deadly  accurate 
of  any  I  have  ever  seen  on  American  courts.  His  posi- 
tion in  the  court  and  his  great  agility  and  quickness  of 
anticipation  made  it  most  difficult  to  get  the  ball  out  of 
reach,  and  he  won  heavily  by  keeping  the  ball  coming 
back  to  his  opponent  until  the  latter  lost  by  error.  Eaves' 
service,  too,  was  comparatively  slow. 

"Mahony's  style  is  labored  and  gives  the  impression  of 
conscientiousness  in  every  play.  He  distorts  his  body 
and  arms  and  often  his  face  in  making  his  strokes,  and  his 
great  precision  is  only  secured  through  the  most  constant 
practice.  He  never  seemed  to  have  enough  match  play, 
and  was  constantly  playing  practice  matches. 

"The  backhand  strength  and  different  style  of  volleying 
and  consequent  altered  position  in  the  court  are  the  chief 
distinctions  between  the  style  of  play  as  represented  by 
American  and  British  experts." 

The  success  of  the  international  game  justifies  the  strong 
hope  that  we  will  have  similar  matches  every  year.  It  is 
plain  that  the  standards  of  skill  on  the  two  sides  of  the 
Atlantic  are  not  wide  apart,  which  is  a  guarantee  of  good 
sport.  With  a  visiting  American  team  in  England  this 
year  some  very  interesting  climatic  and  other  comparisons 
may  be  made.

NATIONAL  HONORS. 

The  honors  of  the  season  were  evenly  distributed — more 
so  than  in  many  years.  Comparatively  little  trouble  was 
experienced  by  the  handicappers,  as  the  players  seemed 
to  naturally  separate  themselves  into  classes,  the  distin- 
guishing lines  being  obvious  to  experts. 
■  Of  course  the  visiting  Britishers  diverted  attention,  and 
the  trio,  with  R.  D.  Wrenn  and  Larned,  constituted  a  bril- 
liant class  of  themselves,  and  they  must  be  included  in  the 
ranking  order,  which  is:

Whitman  and  George  Wrenn  are  the  only  two  men  who 
class  near  the  players  of  the  first  class,  and  in  their  bril- 
liant streaks  their  work  was  notably  good.  Wrenn's  upset 
at  Hoboken  and  Whitman's  defeats  in  Canada  by  players 
of  the  second  class,  and  again  in  the  Intercollegiate  cham- 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  I3 

pionship,  sends  them  back  in  the  lists  to  a  division  com- 
prising fourteen  men. 

Speed  and  brilliancy  mark  the  chief  distinctions  in  skill 
between  the  leaders  of  '97  and  the  second-class  men.  The 
coolness  and  strength  of  Larned  and  Wrenn,  Eaves  and 
Nisbet,  or  the  disposition  not  to  get  rattled,  counts  much 
when  the  play  is  against  nervous  and  weaker  players.  Ef- 
fectiveness in  anticipating  an  opponent's  play  and  the 
nerve  to  play  brilliantly  under  exciting  conditions,  as  well 
as  the  knowledge  of  how  to  play  brilliant  strokes,  are  es- 
sentials in  achieving  the  first  class. 

Among  the  second-class  men  of  the  year  there  was  some 
notably  good  play,  for  they  had  the  open  tournaments 
comparatively  to  themselves,  as  Wrenn  and  Larned  were 
furnishing  the  rarest  sport  of  their  careers  in  the  interna- 
tional matches.  There  was  also  more  or  less  uncertainty 
in  the  second  class;  for  instance,  Ware  played  brilliantly 
in  the  Canadian  championship,  and  thereafter  never 
showed  at  any  time  nearly  so  good  form.  At  New- 
port Whitman  played  admirably,  and  disappointed  his 
friends  in  all  his  other  matches.  Bond  was  at  his  best  in 
the  Niagara  International.  Ward  was  a  surprise  in  the 
Massachusetts  tournament.  Forbes  in  the  Longwood  and 
Intercollegiate  meetings  was  at  his  best,  and  Sorrento 
and  Newport  were  responsible  for  his  finest  work  of  the 
year. 

There  were  many  ups-and-downs  and  in  the  second 
division  many  reversals  of  form.  A  victory  one  week 
frequently  preceded  a  defeat  the  following  week  at  the 
same  hands.  Third-class  men  won  frequently  from  play- 
ers of  the  second  class,  indicating  an  improvement  lower 
down  in  the  roll  and  the  delightful  uncertainty  of  the 
game. 

Whitman's  defeat  of  Mahony  was  the  most  notable  up- 
set of  the  year,  and  it  was  seconded  by  S.  G.  Thomson's 
victory  over  Forbes  in  the  Intercollegiate.     Thurber's  de-

feat  of  Fischer,  Avery's  of  Ward  and  Gross'  of  Paret  were 
not  in  any  instances  on  the  cards. 

Collins,  Bond  and  Forbes  proved  to  be  the  additions 
of  the  year  to  the  list  of  men  who  deservedly  class  as  ex- 
perts. All  three  are  comparatively  new  to  the  followers  of 
the  game.  Collins,  of  the  West,  played  consistently  and 
well,  winning  an  open  or  two,  and  then  walking  off  with 
the  Western  championship  from  a  clever  field,  including 
Fischer,  Ware  and  Sheldon.  Carr  Neel's  defeat  by  Col- 
lins was  attributed  in  a  measure  to  the  former's  lack  of 
practice.  Collins  plays  a  "safe"  game,  returning  every- 
thing with  precision,  but  having  few  safe  strokes.  Bond 
and  Forbes  (the  former  a  Western  man)  represent  differ- 
ent types.  Bond  is  of  the  Neel  type,  while  Forbes  re- 
sembles in  some  respects  Larned  in  his  earlier  tennis  days. 

The  success  of  Ware  and  Sheldon  in  the  doubles  cham- 
pionship was  one  of  the  surprises  of  the  season,  and 
brought  Harvard  and  Yale  together  in  a  most  gratifying 
way.  Larned  and  Wrenn  only  played  once  in  doubles, 
and  then  Whitman  and  George  Wrenn  beat  them  at  Long- 
wood.  Ware  and  Sheldon  played  well  and  successfully 
together,  although  exponents  of  different  styles,  which, 
however,  brought  good  results. 

Ward  and  Dodge,  of  Harvard  and  Yale,  respectively, 
are  possible  coming  champions.  Ward's  play  in  and  near 
Boston  attracted  favorable  comment,  as  did  that  of  Dodge 
at  Sorrento,  Newport  and  in  the  Intercollegiate.  Wright 
(who  is  to  represent  Harvard)  and  Hackett  are  also  prom- 
ising lower  class  players. 

Necessarily  a  number  of  Western  and  Pacific  Coast  play- 
ers of  ability  are  not  mentioned  in  the  lists  for  the  simple 
reason  that  the  standard  of  play  is  judged  by  Eastern  play- 
ers. Owing  to  their  inability  to  play  enough,  the  handi- 
cappers  and  ranking  committee  have  been  unable  to  classi- 
fy Richard  Stevens,  S.  C.  Millett  and  S.  G.  Thomson.

OFFICIAL  RANK  LIST  FOR  1897. 

The  rank  list  for  1897,  as  announced  by  the  ranking 
committee,  Dr.  James  Dwight,  L.  E.  Ware,  and  E.  P. 
Fischer,  is  of  especial  interest,  and  shows  most  careful 
discrimination.  The  committee  has  had  no  easy  task  in 
determining  the  relative  position  to  which  the  different 
players  were  entitled,  but  an  intelligent  glance  backward 
at  the  work  done  by  the  men  during  the  season  shows  that 
the  greatest  thought  and  judgment  have  been  displayed. 

The  list,  as  determined  upon  by  the  committee,  is  as  fol- 
lows: 

Class  I.— (Scratch)  R.  D.  Wrenn,  W.  A.  Larned,  and 
W.  V.  Eaves. 

Class  2.— (1-6)  H.  A.  Nisbet. 

Class  3.— (3-6)  H.  S.  Mahony,  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  and  M. 
D.  Whitman. 

Class  4.— (4-6)  Kreigh  Collins,  E.  P.  Fischer,  W.  S. 
Bond,  L.  E.  Ware,  and  J.  D.  Forbes. 

Class  5.— (15)  J.  P.  Paret,  C.  R.  Budlong,  G.  P.  Sheldon, 
Jr.,  and  C.  P.  Dodge. 

Class  6.— (15  plus  1-6)  Evarts  Wrenn,  Holcombe  Ward, 
Reginald  Fincke,  G.  W.  Lee,  and  M.  D.  Smith. 

Class  7.— (15  plus  3-6)  D.  W.  Davis,  A.  Codman,  Beals 
Wright,  J.  C.  Neely,  J.  F.  Davidson,  R.  D.  Thurber,  J.  A. 
Ryerson,  Ralph  McKittrick. 

Class  8.— (15  plus  4-6)  A.  P.  Hawes,  H.  H.  Hackett, 
Richard  Hooker,  J.  C.  Goodfellow,  and  H.  E.  Avery. 

Class  9.— (15  plus  5-6)  R.  D.  Little,  W.  K.  Auchincloss, 
R.  T.  Gross,  and  M.  F.  Goodbody. 

A  comparative  glance  at  the  above  list  and  the  list  for 
1896  is  of  interest. 

This  year  the  committee  has  ranked  thirty-seven  men  as 
against  thirty-three  last  year.  Of  last  year's  list  the  fol- 
lowing are  omitted  in  the  1897  list:  C.  B.  Neel,  F.  H. 
Hovey,  R.  Stevens,  James  Terry,  J.  F.  Talmage,  Jr.,  G.  H. 
Miles,  W.  M.  Scudder,  R.  P.  Davis,  W.  A.  Battel,  C.  Cra-

The  following  men  are  ranked  this  year  who  did  not  re-

Little,  W.  K.  Auchincloss,  R.  T.  Gross,  and  M.  F.  Good-

their  proper  positions  in  the  rank  list.

THE  NEWPORT  TOURNAMENT. 

The  seventeenth  annual  open  tournament  for  the  cham- 
pionship of  the  United  States  in  men's  singles,  and  the 
double  championship,  opened  at  Newport  on  August  17. 

There  have  been  Newport  tournaments  before,  and  there 
have  been  previous  Newport  tournaments  which  con- 
tained an  international  element;  but  never  before  had 
tennis  enthusiasm  reached  such  a  height,  even  in  spite  of 
such  wretched  weather,  which  caused  postponement  on 
two  of  the  scheduled  days.  Tennis  lovers  gathered  from 
all  parts  of  the  country,  and  Newport  society  turned  out 
in  full  force,  forgetting  other  engagements  in  the  excite- 
ment of  the  matches. 

No  one  who  had  carefully  watched  the  work  of  the  visit- 
ing English  team  in  their  matches  previous  to  Newport 
could  fail  to  be  impressed  with  the  belief  that  they  had  not 
shown  their  full  strength;  and  this  feeling  was  verified 
by  the  magnificent  stand  made  by  Eaves  and  Nisbet.  Ma- 
hony's  work  cannot  fairly  be  criticised,  as  he  was  con- 
siderably out  of  condition. 

This  feeling  of  uncertainty  added  much  to  the  interest  of 
the  matches,  but  when  Earned  fell  before  Nisbet  the  great- 
est fears  were  entertained  for  the  championship.  Dr. 
Eaves  had  not  been  pushed  to  any  extent  up  to  the  cham- 
pionship, having  drawn  on  the  easy  side  of  the  tourna- 
ment, yet  had  shown  himself  to  be  the  greatest  master  of 
the  game  of  any  visiting  player  we  had  seen  in  the  tourna- 
ment play. 

The  great  disappointment  of  the  tournament  was  the  de- 
feat of  Earned.  He  has  so  many  times  come  so  near  to 
the  championship,  and  has  done  so  much  for  the  advance- 
ment of  American  tennis,  that  it  was  generally  hoped  that 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  25 

he  would  be  the  challenger  this  year;  and  had  he  suc- 
ceeded in  wresting  the  honors  from  Champion  Wrenn  the 
championship  would  still  have  remained  in  worthy  hands. 

Wrenn's  victory  over  Eaves  entitles  him  to  the  highest 
position  not  only  in  this  country  but  in  the  tennis  world. 
No  stronger  man  could  have  been  sent  against  us  than 
Dr.  Eaves,  and  to  have  beaten  him,  even  while  outplayed 
in  every  point  of  the  game,  proves  beyond  question  that 
Wrenn  possesses  certain  qualifications  which  are  as  unique 
as  they  are  remarkable. 

The  important  matches  were  as  follows: 

WARE-SHELDON  VS.  NISBET-MAHONY. 
The  first  set  opened  unfavorably  for  the  Americans,  who 
appeared  nervous  and  uncertain  in  their  strokes.  The 
English  players  quickly  improved  their  opportunity  and 
ran  the  score  up  to  4-1.  At  this  point,  however,  the 
Americans  steadied  down,  and  by  superb  play  brought  the 
score  to  games  all.  Then  came  a  terrific  struggle  to  win 
the  necessary  two  games  in  succession,  and  it  was  only 
after  games  all  was  called  seven  times  that  the  Englishmen 
finally  scored  a  win.  The  Americans,  in  this  set,  out- 
placed their  opponents,  and  made  less  errors,  but  these 
mistakes  came  at  critical  times. 

In  the  second  set  the  Americans  entirely  outclassed  the 
visitors,  who  won  but  seventeen  points  in  all.  Ware's 
work  was  especially  creditable.  The  third  set  was  another 
long  deuce  one,  being  full  of  exciting  rallies,  in  which  the 
Americans  were  usually  successful,  finally  winning,  9-7. 
The  fourth  set  showed  the  Englishmen  at  their  best. 
The  Americans  completely  reversed  things  in  the  fifth 
and  decisive  set,  outplaying  the  visitors  at  every  point. 

A  recapitulation  of  the  match  shows  the  comparative 
work  of  the  four  players:

As  the  Neel  brothers  did  not  appear  to  defend  their  title, 
the  double  championship  for  1897  passed  to  Ware  and 
Sheldon  by  default. 

LARNED  VS.  G.  L.  WRENN,  JR. 
Larned's  match  with  George  Wrenn  was  the  first  im- 
portant meeting  in  the  singles.  Larned  was  in  splendid 
form,  while  Wrenn  played  his  strongest  game.  Wrenn's 
best  work  was  in  the  second  and  fourjth  sets,  the  former  of 
which  he  won,  and  in  the  latter  coming  within  a  point  of 
winning  several  times.  Larned  seemed  to  be  particularly 
strong  at  critical  points. 

WHITMAN    VS.    MAHONY. 
Whitman  won  the  distinction  of  scoring  the  only  vic- 
tory in  the  tournament,  with  the  exception  of  Wrenn,  over 
the  visiting  players. 

A  recapitulation  of  the  match  follows:

NISBET  VS.  WHITMAN. 
Whitman's  victory  over  Mahony  gave  added  interest  to 
his  meeting  with  Nisbet.  It  was  hardly  expected  that  he 
would  win,  as  Nisbet's  pace  made  him  in  many  ways  a 
more  formidable  opponent  than  Mahony;  but  the  ^Ameri- 
can player  displayed  even  more  brilliant  form  than  on  the 
previous  day,  and  all  but  scored  another  victory. 

A  glance  at  the  recapitulation  shows  that  Whitman  out- 
placed his  opponent:

NISBET   VS. 

The  match  of  the  tournament,  up  to  the  championship, 
was  in  the  semi-final  match  between  Nisbet  and  Larned. 
The  defeat  of  Larned,  who  really  was  considered  as  the 
surest  hope  against  the  visitors,  was  the  only  disappoint-

ment  of  the  tournament;  but  it  developed  a  match  filled 
with  the  greatest  excitement  It  is  rarely  that  one  sees 
the  tables  so  completely  turned  as  in  this  match,  but  it  is 
gratifying  to  note  that  Larned's  defeat  was  not  the  result 
of  a  break-down  in  his  form,  as  has  so  often  been  the  case 
at  Newport.

The  final  match  was  a  disappointment,  and  could  hardly 
be  called  a  contest.  Dr.  Eaves  so  completely  over- 
shadowed his  younger  opponent  that  at  no  time  was  there 
any  question  in  regard  to  the  result.  Nisbet  seemed  to 
accept  defeat  as  a  foregone  conclusion,  and  was  appar- 
ently indifferent  to  the  score.     The  recapitulation  follows:

WRENN  VS.  EAVES. 

The  championship  match  was  unquestionably  the  most 
superb  exhibition  of  tennis  we  have  yet  seen  in  America. 
On  the  one  hand  there  was  the  foremost  player  of  Eng- 
land, in  perfect  condition,  and  with  every  intention  of 
carrying  back  with  him  the  United  States  championship; 
on  the  other  was  the  one  player  whom  the  tennis  world  has 
never  looked  to  in  vain  to  rise  to  the  occasion.  Wrenn's 
game  was  persistency  personified;  and  although  Eaves 
outplaced  him,  out-volleyed  him,  and  out-lobbed  him,  the 
American  champion,  by  covering  his  court  as  it  never  was 
covered  before,  even  balls  apparently  out  of  his  reach,  suc- 
ceeded in  wresting  a  magnificent  victory  from  his  more 
brilliant  antagonist.     Eaves'  fatal  mistake  was  his  failure 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  29 

to  "kill"  his  smashes  and  volleys,  for  when  on  the  oppo- 
site side  no  placing  can  be  considered  as  safe.

THE  CHAMPIONSHIP   DOUBLES. 

The  Eastern  championship  doubles  at  Longwood  in 
July,  although  somewhat  overshadowed  by  the  unusual 
international  attraction  in  the  singles,  were  extremely  in- 
teresting and  the  finals  awakened  keen  excitement.  With 
the  exception  of  the  Ward-Davis  vs.  George  Wrenn- Whit- 
man match,  there  were  but  two  important  matches.  The 
final  doubles — Nisbet-Mahony  vs.  Wrenn- Whitman — took 
on  an  additional  interest  because  of  their  international 
aspect.  The  match  throughout  was  an  admirable  exhibi- 
tion. Nisbet  is  the  best  double  player  yet  seen  in  this 
country,  and  the  visitor's  victory  was  largely  due  to  the 
excellence  of  his  play.  Wrenn  and  Whitman  made  a  very 
strong  pair  and  were  congratulated  on  the  stand  they  made 
against  such  formidable  opponents. 

In  the  West  it  was  a  foregone  conclusion  that  Fischer 
and  Neely  and  Ware  and  Sheldon  were  superior  to  their 
rivals  and  would  contest  the  finish;  and  so  it  turned  out, 
and  they  were  responsible  for  the  best  exhibition  of  double 
tennis  ever  seen  in  the  West.  Fischer's  smashing  was  of 
a  high  order,  and  Neely  played  steadily,  but  Ware  and 
Sheldon,  aided  by  luck  and  pluck  and  magnificent  steadi- 
ness, won  out. 

At  Newport  the  final  result,  which  was  as  unexpected  as 
it  was  satisfactory,  was  a  most  stubbornly  contested  match 
throughout,  and  confirmed  the  belief  that  prevailed  that 
the  English  game  is  far  better  suited  to  singles  than  dou- 
bles. The  speed  Ware  and  Sheldon  put  into  their  game 
and  the  sharpness  which  marked  it  throughout  was  the 
only  combination  which  could  bring  success,  for  both  the 
American  players  were  individually  outclassed. 

As  the  Neel  brothers  did  not  appear  to  defend  their  title, 
the  double  championship  for  1897  passed  to  Ware  and 
Sheldon  by  default.

THE  WOMEN'S  CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
The  tournament  for  the  women's  championships  was 
held  last  spring  as  usual  at  Wissahickon  Heights,  under 
the  management  of  the  Philadelphia  Cricket  Club,  on  June 
15  and  the  following  days.  It  scored  the  usual  success, 
thanks  to  the  efficient  management  of  the  home  club.  The 
matches  throughout  were  well  contested,  but  it  was  con- 
ceded that  Miss  Juliette  Atkinson,  of  the  Staten  Island 
Club,  was  the  most  promising  candidate  for  final  honors, 
and  the  experts  were  right.  Miss  Atkinson's  hardest 
match  was  against  Miss  Maude  Banks,  of  the  Philadelphia 
Cricket  Club.  Their  contest  was  that  of  two  thoroughly 
skilled  players,  and  although  Miss  Atkinson  proved  to  be 
the  winner.  Miss  Banks  pressed  her  hard  and  compelled 
New  York's  representative  to  play  the  best  game  she  was 
capable  of.  The  score  of  the  three  sets  was:  6-i,  4-6,  6-1. 
There  was  added  interest  when  it  transpired  that  Miss  At- 
kinson and  Miss  Moore  would  again  meet  in  the  cham- 
pionship round. 

During  the  last  few  years  these  players  have  met  six 
times,  and  as  each  had  three  victories  to  her  credit,  last 
year's  match  was  to  all  purposes  a  deciding  one.  In  '96 
Miss  Moore  and  Miss  Atkinson,  between  them,  won  every 
ladies'  tournament  in  this  country,  besides  two  in  Canada, 
including  the  New  Jersey,  the  Middle  States,  the  New 
England,  and  other  championships. 

The  standard  of  play  in  last  year's  championship  match 
was  not  only  a  fine  exhibition  of  grit  and  endurance,  but 
completely  surpassed  its  predecessors.  Miss  Atkinson 
won  the  first  two  sets  by  the  excellence  of  her  placing,  and 
her  general  steadiness,  only  to  lose  the  next  two  sets  after 
some  masterly  tennis.  With  an  even  score,  the  impression 
prevailed  that  the  champion  would  successfully  defend  the 
title,  but  Miss  Atkinson  rallied  for  a  supreme  effort  and 
won  the  decisive  set. 

In  the  mixed  doubles  Miss  Henson  and  D.  L.  Magruder

won,  and  their  hardest  struggle  was  made  against  Miss 
Coombs  and  F.  Morgan  in  the  semi-final  round. 

The  Misses  Atkinson  succeeded  in  capturing  the  ladies' 
doubles  after  a  close  match  against  Miss  Rotch  and  Miss 
Banks  in  the  semi-finals.

THE  WESTERN    CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  Western  Championship  Tournament,  played  at  Chi- 
cago in  July,  was  far  in  advance  of  anything  ever  seen  be- 
fore in  the  West.  It  excelled  in  the  number  of  players,  in 
the  condition  of  the  grounds,  the  number  of  excellent 
courts  and  in  the  crowds  of  enthusiastic  spectators.  Al- 
though there  were  sixty-four  entries  in  the  singles  (and 
twenty  in  the  doubles  decided  at  the  same  tournament), 
thanks  to  the  excellent  management  of  Mr.  James  P.  Gard- 
ner and  the  beautiful  weather,  the  tournament  was  con- 
ducted without  the  slightest  delay  or  friction.  Much  of  the 
interest  in  the  tournament  was  due  to  the  presence,  of 
Fischer,  Ware  and  Sheldon  from  the  East.  Collins,  win- 
ner of  the  tournament,  defeated  in  succession  Ware,  Fisch- 
er and  Bond;  while  Bond,  a  University  of  Chicago  man, 
had  previously  won  from  Sheldon  in  straight  sets,  leading 
Western  men  to  believe  that  the  West  is  nearly  equal  to  the 
East  in  point  of  skill  in  the  singles.  Collins  played  with 
excellent  judgment  and  plenty  of  nerve  and  courage.  Even 
at  his  best  it  was  thought  that  Collins  would  have  defeated 
Carr  Neel.  The  second  set  Collins  won  at  7-5,  after  Neel 
was  in  the  lead  at  5-2.  The  third  set  Neel  won  by  Collins' 
wildness,  Collins  driving  a  few  inches  out  of  the  line  re- 
peatedly, while  before  it  had  been  a  few  inches  in.

years  the  best  experts  in  the  covintry  have  struggled  to  get 
possession  of  the  valuable  trophy,  first  won  by  R.  L.  Beeck- 
man  in  1887.  Three  different  players  captured  the  cup 
twice — Howard  A.  Taylor  in  1888  and  1889,  Richard  Stev- 
ens in  1892  and  1893,  and  W.  A.  Larned  in  1894  and  1895. 
In  '96  Larned  was  abroad  and  could  not  defend  the  title. 
Hobart,  the  winner  of  '96,  announced  that  he  would  not 
defend  the  title,  and  so  the  winner  of  the  '97  final  became 
the  owner  of  the  beautiful  trophy.  Paret  caused  two  up- 
sets in  defeating  Ware  and  Sheldon  in  successive  rounds; 
favorites  won  the  other  important  matches.  Stevens,  after 
the  first  set,  defeated  Paret  handily  in  the  semi-finals,  and 
Larned  won  from  Whitman  in  the  same  round  in  straight 
sets.  Larned  outclassed  Stevens  in  the  finals.  In  the 
doubles  Larned  and  Stevens  were  expected  to  win  through 
their  individual  superiority,  but  they  met  defeat  at  the 
hands  of  Ward  and  Davis,  with  Ware  and  Sheldon  win- 
ning the  final.  Whitman  displayed  strength  in  the  handi- 
cap singles  and  captured  the  prize.  The  full  scores  follow:

THE  NEW  ENGLAND  CHAMPIONSHIP. 
The  tenth  annual  tournament  was  held  on  the  grounds 
of  the  New  Haven  Lawn  Club,  commencing  May  25  and 
continuing  through  the  week.  The  feature  of  the  tourna- 
ment was  the  presence  of  Mr.  Thomas  A.  Driscoll,  of  San 
Francisco.  The  important  match  of  the  tournament  was 
that  played  between  Driscoll  and  G.  P.  Sheldon,  Jr.,  in  the 
second  round.  The  latter  is  ranked  among  the  first  ten 
for  1896,  and  it  was  thought  that  he  might  show  stronger 
tennis  than  the  man  from  the  Pacific  Coast.  A  large  as- 
semblage witnessed  the  contest.  The  first  set  was  won  by 
Sheldon  6-3,  because  he  put  more  pace  on  the  balls  and 
was  more  accurate,  passing  Driscoll  thirteen  times,  being 
passed  four  times.  During  the  second  set  Sheldon  seemed 
to  lose  his  measure  of  the  court,  and  as  a  result  many  balls 
were  backed  out,  and  the  set  was  lost,  2>-6,  as  was  also  the 
third  and  last  set  for  the  same  reason,  2-6.    The  result  of 


44  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

the  match  practically  settled  the  winner  of  the  tournament. 
Driscoll  met  Hooker  in  the  finals,  which  he  won  in  straight 
sets,  and  so  added  to  his  list  of  championships  that  of  New 
England  for  1897. 

Following  is  the  score:

THE  SOUTHERN  CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  eleventh  annual  tournament  for  the  championship 
of  the  South  began  on  the  courts  of  the  Bachelor  Club  at 
Washington  on  May  i8th,  and  proved  the  most  successful 
event  ever  given  by  the  Southern  Association.  The  first 
important  match  in  the  tournament  was  that  between  T.  A. 
Driscoll  and  J.  C.  Davidson  in  the  first  round.  Davidson 
played  a  strong,  consistent  game  throughout  the  match, 
and  nearly  succeeded  in  forcing  his  brilliant  opponent  to 
lower  colors.  In  the  finals  Driscoll  outclassed  Warfield, 
although  the  latter  proved  himself  a  worthy  antagonist. 
The  championship  match  was  the  most  interesting  of  the 
tournament.  Paret  started  out  strongly,  and  taking  ad- 
vantage of  Driscoll's  apparent  nervousness,  easily  won  the 
first  set.  From  this  point  out  Driscoll  played  up  to  his 
standard,  and  the  championship  changed  hands.  In  the 
doubles  Davidson  and  Paret  had  little  difficulty  in  winning 
out.

THE  NORTHWESTERN  CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  ninth  annual  tournament  for  the  Northwestern 
championships,  held  at  Lake  Minnetonka,  Minn.,  the  week 
of  August  2d,  proved  a  greater  success  than  any  tennis 
tournament  ever  held  in  Minnesota. 

Among  the  thirty-two  entries  were  fourteen  from  Chi- 
cago, and  one  from  Wisconsin,  North  Dakota,  and  West 
Point. 

The  tournament  was  managed  by  Charles  W.  Folds  and 
George  K.  Belden,  of  the  Minneapolis  Tennis  Club.  They 
conceived  the  idea  of  making  a  "round-robin"  tournament 
of  the  last  eight  men,  or  after  two  open  rounds  had  been 
played,  the  winner  to  be  the  player  with  the  best  average 
of  matches  won  in  the  "round-robin," 

The  entry  being  open  to  all,  the  eight  best  men  were 
determined  in  the  first  two  rounds.  The  best  matches  in 
the  second  round  were:  Bond  vs.  J.  C.  Neely,  Jr.,  4-6,  6-2, 
6-4;  and  Bethel  vs.  Harry  Belden,  8-6,  6-3. 

The  "round-robin"  began  with  George  K.  Belden,  of 
Minneapolis;  W.  H.  Bethel,  of  West  Point;  W.  S.  Bond, 
W.  L.  Myers,  S,  R.  Neel,  Evarts  Wrenn,  L.  H.  Waidner, 
and  J.  W.  Carver,  of  Chicago. 

Carver,  after  defeating  Sam  Neel,  6-4,  6-2,  met  Bethel,  of 
West  Point.  The  latter  had  won  the  first  set,  though 
points  were  even  when  Carver  turned  his  ankle  and  had 
to  withdraw  from  the  "round-robin."  Sam  Neel  also 
withdrew  and  devoted  himself  to  his  double  game.  This 
told  on  Bond's  game,  the  runner-up  of  the  Western,  and 
he  lost  all  but  one  match. 

Bethel,  of  West  Point,  N.  Y,,  played  a  fine  back-court 
game.  As  final  winner  of  the  Northwestern  champion- 
ship, he  showed  great  skill  and  endurance,  winning  in  one 
day  from  both  Myers  and  Belden. 

Belden,  the  Minneapolis  champion,  played  an  erratic 
game,  at  times  being  more  brilliant  than  any  of  his  com- 
petitors, but  on  other  days  falling  sadly  off  in  his  play. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  47 

He  defeated  Bethel  handily  in  their  first  match  by  fine 
driving  and  quickness  at  the  net.  In  the  final  match, 
when  they  were  tied,  Bethel's  steadiness  was  too  much  for 
him. 

At  the  end  of  the  "round-robin"  four  men  were  tied — 
W.  A.  Bethel,  George  K.  Belden,  W.  L.  Myers  and  Evarts 
Wrenn — each  having  won  four  and  lost  two  matches. 
Wrenn  defaulted  to  Belden  on  the  play-off,  and  Bethel 
defeated  Myers  in  a  close  match.  Both  men  drove  from 
one  base  line  to  the  other,  Myers  leading  on  the  final  set 
at  5-3.  Here  he  let  down,  and  Bethel  pulled  out  the 
match. 

The  "round-robin"  score  was: 

Won.  Lost, 

Bethel 3  2 

Belden 3  2 

Myers 3  2 

E.    Wrenn 3  2 

Waidner 2  3 

Bond 1  4 

The  score  on  the  play-off  was: 

Bethel  vs.  Myers 4-6        6-0        7-5 

Bethel  vs.  Belden 2-6       6-4       6-3 

In  doubles  Sam  Neel  and  Belden  defeated  Evarts  Wrenn 
and  John  Neely,  6-4,  6-2.  Bond  and  Myers,  of  Chicago, 
beat  Tayne  and  H.  Belden  in  a  pretty  lobbing  match,  6-4, 
4-6,  6-4. 

In  the  final  round  Bond  and  Myers  won  from  Belden 
and  Sam  Neel  after  five  sets  of  very  pretty  tennins,  7-5, 
4-6,  6-3,  2-6,  6-3.  In  the  championship  round  Carver  and 
Waidner,  the  holders,  were  successful.  They  defeated 
Bond  and  Myers  after  four  sets  of  good  tennis,  in  which 
the  lob  was  little  used.  Score,  7-5,  2-6,  6-3,  6-2.  This  left 
Carver  and  Waidner  as  double  champions  and  W.  A. 
Bethel  as  single  champion  of  the  Northwest.  The  single 
championship  went  by  default,  as  Carr  Neel  could  not  at-

THE  PACIFIC  COAST  CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  tenth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of 
the  Pacific  States  in  singles  took  place  at  San  Rafael  on 
July  2,  3  and  5,  and  was  a  complete  success,  players  and 
spectators  outnumbering  that  of  previous  years.  There 
were  no  defaults  and  a  new  champion  was  produced. 

The  winner  of  the  all-comers  and  also  of  the  champion- 
ship was  Geo.  F.  Whitney,  of  the  California  Club  of  San 
Francisco.  The  most  important  matches  were  between 
Sumner  Hardy  and  W.  F.  Dillingham,  the  Honolulu 
champion.  The  latter  was  no  match  for  Hardy,  who  won, 
6-3,  6-2.  Robert  N.  Whitney  put  R.  Nicholson,  a  new  and 
promising  player,  out  of  the  tournament  in  straight  sets, 
6-2,  7-5- 

The  match  which  really  decided  who  would  be  the  all- 
comers champion  was  that  between  George  Whitney  and 
Sumnef  Hardy.  Whitney  won,  8-6,  6-3.  The  final  match 
was  between  George  and  Robert  Whitney,  the  former  win- 
ning, 7-5,  6-4,  6-3. 

George  Whitney,  winning  the  all-comers,  met  Sam 
Hardy,  the  champion,  on  July  5.  Hardy  went  to  the  front 
in  the  first  set,  winning,  6-4,  and  the  second,  6-1.  Whitney 
played  like  a  different  man  in  the  third  and  fourth,  win-

ning  both.     Whitney  then  captured  the  next  set,  8-6,  and 
the  championship. 


THE    PACIFIC    NORTHWEST    CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  eighth  annual  Pacific  Northwestern  singles  cham- 
pionship was  decided  at  Tacoma,  Aug.  ii,  and  J.  F. 
Foulkes  proved  to  be  the  winner,  repeating  his  victory 
of  '95. 


THE  CANADIAN  CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
The  annual  tournament  for  the  Canadian  championships 
of  1897  began  July  13  on  the  courts  of  the  Queen's  Royal 
Hotel  at  Niagara-on-the-Lake,  and  proved  to  be  success- 
ful in  every  way.  L.  E.  Ware  turned  out  to  be  the  winner 
in  singles,  doubles  and  handicap  singles,  defeating,  in  the 
first  named  event.  Dodge,  Whitman  and  Fischer  in  well 
contested  games.  In  the  doubles  Ware  and  Sheldon 
played  well  together,  though  hard  pushed  by  Wright  and 
Fincke  in  the  semi-finals,  and  by  Whitman  and  Fischer  in 
the  finals.  Miss  Atkinson  outclassed  her  opponents  in 
the  championship  round  and  had  no  difficulty  in  winning.

MASSACHUSETTS  STATE  TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the 
Bay  State  was  held  at  Longwood,  June  17,  and  the  follow- 
ing days.  The  chief  interest  centered  in  the  matches  be- 
tween Whitman  and  Ware  in  the  third  round,  and  Ware

pretty  match.  Ward  won  a  creditable  victory  in  the  finals

he  won  fifteen  consecutive  points.

The  sixteenth  annual  tournament  for  the  Intercollegiate 
championship  was  played  at  the  New  Haven  Lawn  Club, 
beginning  Oct.  5.  Disappointment  was  expressed  owing 
to  the  absence  of  Driscoll,  the  Georgetown  crack,  and  the 
failure  of  Amherst,  Trinity  and  Pennsylvania  to  be  repre- 
sented. Nevertheless  the  tournament  was  one  of  the  most 
interesting  on  record.  It  was  discovered  when  the  draw- 
ings were  made  that  the  Harvard  players  were  all  on  one 
side.  They  protested  vigorously,  but  the  rules  would  not 
legalize  a  new  draw.  Whitman  of  Harvard  was  regarded 
as  a  sure  winner,  but  he  succumbed  to  Forbes.  S.  G. 
Thomson,  of  Princeton,  however,  upset  all  calculations 
by  showing  unexpected  form  in  the  final  match,  and  win- 
ning the  much-prized  title.  In  the  doubles,  Whitman  and 
Ware,  of  Harvard,  won  easily,  having  as  their  strongest 
opponents  another  Harvard,  composed  of  Ward  and  Davis, 
winners  of  the  second  prize.     The  scores  follow:

THE    CHICAGO    NORTHWESTERN    INTERCOL- 
LEGIATE TENNIS. 

A  dual  tournament  with  Northwestern,  held  on  Chica- 
go's courts,  May  22,  was  won  by  the  University  of  Chicago 
by  a  total  of  six  points  to  four.  The  showing  made  by 
Chicago  was  disappointing.  The  carelessness  of  Poulson 
lost  one  match  in  doubles,  while  Anderson's  indiflference 
was  responsible  for  the  loss  of  a  match  in  singles.  North- 
western showed  better  form,  correspondingly,  than  Chi- 
cago. 

The  scores  follow:

THE  MAINE  INTERCOLLEGIATE. 

The  sixth  annual  tournament  of  the  Maine  Intercol- 
legiate Tennis  Association  was  held  on  the  grounds  of  the 
Portland  Athletic  Club  during  the  week  of  June  7.  Rep- 
resentatives were  present  from  Bates,  Bowdoin  and  Colby. 

The  singles  cup  was  a  new  one,  competed  for  this  year 
for  the  first  time.  The  cup  for  doubles  had  been  won  once 
by  Bates  and  once  by  Bowdoin.  It  is  necessary  for  a  col- 
lege to  win  the  cup  three  years  to  acquire  permanent  own- 
ership of  it. 

The  finest  match  of  the  tournament  was  that  between 
Ives,  of  Bowdoin,  and  Shannon,  of  Colby.  Both  play  a 
fast  net  game,  and  Shannon  has  an  excellent  stroke.  Ives 
won  by  beautiful  smashing,  6-2,  11-9. 

The  finals  in  doubles  were  won  by  Dana  and  Ives,  of 
Bowdoin;   the  singles  by  Dana,  of  Bowdoin. 

The  scores  follow:

lastic  championship  was  decided  as  usual.  Reginald 
Fincke  for  the  second  time  won  the  Interscholastic  cham-

THE  HARVARD  TOURNAMENT. 

The  seventh  annual  tournament  of  the  Harvard  Inter- 
scholastic Lawn  Tennis  Association  began  on  the  Jarvis 
Field  courts  May  i. 

As  was  the  case  in  past  tournaments,  there  was  an  espe- 
cial incentive  urging  the  young  exponents  of  the  game  to 
a  win.  To  the  winner  of  the  tournament  went  the  title  of 
Harvard  Interscholastic  Champion,  the  silver  trophy  em- 
blematic of  the  title,  and  the  privilege  of  competing  in  the 
national  interscholastic  tourney  at  Newport. 

The  final  score  of  points  was  as  follows:

Open  Cournatncnts 


THE  LONGWOOD  TOURNAMENT. 

The  Longwood  tournament,  owing  to  the  excellence  of 
its  courts,  to  the  perfection  of  the  management,  and  to  the 
three-out-of-five  matches,  has  always  been  considered  sec- 
ond only  to  Newport  in  its  importance;  but  last  year's 
record,  on  July  19  and  the  following  days,  with  the  added 
attractions  of  the  presence  of  the  visiting  English  players 
— Mahony,  Eaves  and  Nisbet — (and  of  the  Eastern  dou- 
bles) quite  surpassed  all  previous  years.  The  appreciative 
thanks  of  the  tennis  world  were  extended  to  the  Long- 
wood  Club,  and  particularly  to  Secretary  Palmer  E.  Pres- 
brey,  not  only  for  the  successful  efiforts  made  by  him  to 
persuade  the  Englishmen  to  visit  us,  but  for  the  admirable 
manner  in  which  the  entire  tournament  was  conducted. 

The  particular  interest  of  the  tournament  naturally  cen- 
tered in  the  visiting  players  and  their  success  or  failure 
against  Earned,  as  he  alone  of  those  entered  was  consid- 
ered in  any  way  likely  to  stand  in  their  path  of  victory. 
Unfortunately,  Mahony,  Eaves,  Nisbet,  Earned,  George 
Wrenn  and  Whitman  were  all  drawn  in  the  upper  half  of 
the  tournament,  so  the  best  matches  took  place  before  the 
finals;  yet  J.  D.  Forbes,  the  runner  up,  is  entitled  to  full 
credit  for  the  excellent  game  he  displayed  throughout,  de- 
feating Fincke,  Paret  and  Budlong  in  well-fought  matches. 

The  championship  match  was  full  of  mistakes,  and  did 
not  show  either  man  at  his  best.  Wrenn  showed  lack  of 
practice,  while  Earned  seemed  content  to  let  his  opponent 
defeat  himself.  After  losing  the  first  two  sets,  Wren  gave 
another  display, of  his  wonderful  persistency  and  head- 
work,  and  succeeded  in  winning  the  third  and  fourth,  tie- 
ing  the  score.  The  fifth  set  was,  however,  comparatively 
easy  for  Earned,  who  for  the  first  time  assumed  the  ag- 


Spalding's  lawn  tennis  annual.  71 

gressive.  This  victory  gave  Larned  the  handsome  Long- 
wood  trophy  cup  as  his  permanent  possession,  he  having 
previously  won  it  in  1894  and  1895.

THE  ST.   GEORGE  INTERNATIONAL  TOURNA- 
MENT. 

At  the  St.  George  International  tournament  at  Hoboken 
in  August  the  matches  throughout  were  fiercely  contested, 


72  SPALDING  S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

and  the  success  of  the  American  team  was  won  by  the  clos- 
est scores  and  after  a  hard  struggle.  Larned  again  proved 
himself  invincible,  displaying  even  better  form  than  at 
Longwood.  His  match  against  Eaves  was  of  particular 
interest,  as  it  was  the  first  meeting  of  these  two  players. 
Eaves  showed  himself  to  be  the  strongest  of  the  visiting 
players,  verifying  the  estimates  expressed.  Mahony's  work 
in  this  tournament  should  not  be  criticised,  as  the  hot 
weather  noticeably  aflfected  him.  Champion  Wrenn 
showed  a  notable  improvement  over  his  play  at  Longwood, 
and  gives  promise  of  being  in  admirable  form  at  Newport.

an  Open  handicap  was  held,  also  under  the  auspices  of  the 
United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association.  The 
entries  in  both  events  brought  forth  a  high  class  of  play- 
ers and  a  number  of  even  and  well-contested  matches. 

Stephen  C.  Millett,  after  defeating  E.  P.  Fischer  in  the 
semi-final,  and  J.  C.  Davidson,  of  Washington,  in  the  final 
round  in  three  straight  but  hard-fought  sets,  won  the  new 
title  of  Metropolitan  champion,  and  first  leg  on  the  hand- 
some trophy  offered  by  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  to  the 
first  man  scocing  three  wins.  At  the  first  play  of  the  finals, 
the  doubles  remained  unfinished,  Millett  and  George  L. 
Wrenn  and  Fischer  and  Parker  standing  tied  at  two  sets 
each.  The  match,  when  replayed,  was  won  by  the  former 
pair. 

R.  D.  Thurber,  of  the  West  Side  Club,  by  steady  play 
and  good  generalship,  came  to  the  final  round  in  the  handi- 
cap against  J.  C.  Davidson,  defeating  him  in  three  straight 
sets.

was  of  a  very  high  standard,  and  the  tournament  developed

new  stars.  The  opening  match  was  between  W.  L.  Myers 
and  Kreigh  Collins.  It  was  expected  that  the  match 
would  easily  go  to  Myers,  but  Collins  played  in  fine  form, 
winning  after  three  hard  sets,  7-5,  3-6,  6-4. 

The  Bond  and  Waidner  was  the  next  match  scheduled. 
Waidner  had  good  control  of  his  ground  strokes  for  a 
while,  but  became  unsteady,  and  finally  lost  by  scores 
7-5,  6-3. 

Monday,  Collins  and  N.  W.  Mundy  began  the  day's  play, 
the  match  proving  an  easy  victory  for  the  former,  6-3,  6-1. 

Waidner  proved  too  much  for  McQuiston,  winning 
6-3,  6-2. 

Tuesday,  Myers  and  McQuiston  had  a  very  close  match, 
but  the  experience  and  steadiness  of  Myers  finally  landed 
him  winner,  6-8,  6-3,  8-6. 

The  Collins  and  Waidner  match  proved  to  be  very  in- 
teresting. Collins  had  beaten  Myers,  and  the  result  of  the 
match  was  very  decisive  as  to  the  final  outcome.  Collins 
was  on  his  mettle,  driving  with  great  accuracy  and  win- 
ning the  match,  8-6,  6-4. 

Bond  had  little  trouble  defeating  Mundy,  7-5,  6-2. 

Wednesday  but  one  match  was  played,  that  between 
Myers  and  Mundy,  the  former  winning,  6-2,  12-10. 

Thursday  was  the  critical  day  of  the  tournament,  for 
upon  the  outcome  of  the  day's  play  depended  the  final  re- 
sults. 

Bond  appeared  to  be  very  nervous  and  did  not  take  the 
net,  wherein  his  stronghold  lies,  and  Collins  easily  beat 
him,  6-3,  6-4. 

Myers  and  Waidner,  who  had  both  seemed  considerably 
out  of  form  in  their  former  matches,  gave  an  exhibition  of 
one  of  the  prettiest  matches  of  the  tournament.  The  ten- 
nis was  very  brilliant.  Both  players  use  a  very  swift 
ground  stroke,  and  are  very,  quick  at  the  net.  Myers  won 
the  first  set,  9-11.  The  long  set  seemed  to  tell  on  Myers, 
for  Waidner  won  the  next  two  and  match,  6-4,  6-1. 

McQuiston  and  Mundy  had  a  close  match,  the  former 
winning  in  straight  sets.

Friday,  the  last  day  of  the  tournament,  came  very  near 
developing  a  surprise,  for  McQuiston  came  within  a  few 
points  of  heading  off  Collins,  who  had  a  clear  record  of 
victories.  He  clearly  outplayed  Collins  most  of  the  time, 
and  had  he  been  a  little  steadier  would  have  won.  The 
score :  8-6,  6-4,  4-6. 

Bond's  net  game  proved  too  much  for  Myers'  back  court 
game.  The  former  played  the  best  game  he  had  during 
the  tournament,  winning  6-2,  6-4,

THE  GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first 
game,  shall  be  decided  by  toss  ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of 
the  toss  choose  the  right  to  serve  the  other  player  shall  have 
choice  of  sides,  and  vice  vosa,  or  the  zvinner  of  the  toss  viay 
insist  7'i'pon  a  choice  by  his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the 
Court  the  other  may  elect  not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net  ;  the 
player  who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and 
the  other  the  striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become 
server,  and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out  ;  and  so  on 
alternately  in  all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set,  or  series  of 
sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  serve  with  one  foot  on  the  ground  im- 
mediately behind  the  baseline  ;  the  other  foot  may  be  anywhere 
except  touching  the  base  line  or  the  ground  within  the  Court. 
He  shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right  to  the  left  Courts, 
alternately,  beginning  from  the  right. 

7.  The  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line,  half- 
court  line,  and  side  line  of  the  Court,  diagonally  opposite  to 
that  from  which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  server  fail  to  strike  the  ball,  or  if  the 
ball  served  drop  in  the  net,  or  beyond  the  service  line,  or  out 
of  Court,  or  in  the  wrong  Court,  or  if  the  server  do  not  stand  as 
directed  by  law  6. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same 
Court  from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault 
because  he  served  from  the  wrong  Court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after  the  next  service  is 
delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  till  the  striker-out  is  ready. 
If  the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service  he  shall  be  deemed 
ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not 
ready  counts  for  nothing. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN  TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

14.  The  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken  before 
it  has  touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  iis.  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as 
provided  for  in  law  8. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net  ;  but 
a  service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count 
for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the 
service,  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  ; 
or  if  he  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops 
outside  of  his  opponent's  Court  ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke, 
as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  con- 
secutive faults  ;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play  ;  or  if  he 
return  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's 
Court  ;   or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  Court 
bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or 
anything  that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act 
of  striking  ;  or  if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than 
once  ;  or  if  he  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the 
ball  is  in  play  ;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the 
net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident  not  within 
his  control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  where 
a  permanent  fixture  of  the  Court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident, 
the  point  shall  be  counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed 
around  the  Court  shall  be  considered  permanent  fixtures.  If, 
however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a  permanent  fixture  of  the  Court 
(other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before  it  touches  the  ground,  the 
point  is  lost  ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the  ground,  the  point  shall 
be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is 
called  15  for  that  player  ;  on  either  player  winning  his  second 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  30  for  that  player  ;  on  either  player 
winning  his  third  stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player  ; 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

and  the  fourth  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for 
that  player,  except  as  below  :  If  both  players  have  won  three 
strokes  the  score  is  called  deuce,  and  the  next  stroke  won  by 
either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  that  player.  If  the  same 
player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  ;  if  he  lose  the 
next  stroke,  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until  one 
player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set  ;  except 
as  below  :  If  both  players  win  five  games,  the  score  is  called 
^if/ies  all ;  and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored 
advantage  game  for  that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the 
next  game  he  wins  the  set  ;  if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score 
returns  to  games  all ;  and  so  on  until  either  player  wins  the  two 
games  immediately  following  the  score  of  games  all,  when  he 
wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having  charge  of  any  tourna- 
ment may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule  by  the  omission 
of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  every  set  ; 
but  the  umpire,  on  appeal  from  either  player  before  the  toss  for 
choice,  shall  direct  the  players  to  change  sides  at  the  end  of 
the  first,  third,  fifth,  and  every  succeeding  alternate  game  of 
each  set  ;  but  if  the  appeal  be  made  after  the  toss  for  choice, 
the  umpire  may  only  direct  the  players  to  change  sides  at  the 
end  of  the  first,  third,  fifth,  and  every  succeeding  alternate 
game  of  the  odd  or  deciding  set.  If  the  players  change  Courts 
in  the  alternate  games  throughout  the  match  as  above,  they 
shall  play  in  the  first  game  of  each  set  after  the  first  in  the 
Courts  in  which  they  respectively  did  not  play  in  the  first  game 
of  the  set  immediately  preceding. 

25.  When  a  series  of  sets  is  played,  the  player  who  served 
in  the  last  game  of  one  set  shall  be  striker-out  in  the  first  game 
of  the  next. 

26.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded;  provided,  however,  that 
between  ail  sets  after  the  second  set  either  player  is  entitled  to 
a  rest,  which  shall  not   exceed  seven  minutes  ;  and   provided. 


SPALDING  S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

further,  that  in  case  of  an  unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the 
control  of  the  contestants,  a  cessation  of  play  which  shall  not 
exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed  between  points  ;  but  this 
proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the  privilege  never 
granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover  his 
strength  or  wind.  The  umpire  in  his  discretion  may  at  any 
time  postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition 
of  the  ground  or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement  the 
previous  score  shall  hold  good.  When  the  play  has  ceased  for 
more  than  an  hour  the  player,  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was 
in  the  Court  first  chosen,  shall  have  the  choice  of  Courts  on  the 
recommencement  of  play.  He  shall  stay  in  the  Court  he 
chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last  two  sentences 
of  this  rule  do  not  apply  when  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  rule  24. 

27.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who 
ought  to  have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  dis- 
covery shall  be  counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed 
before  such  discovery,  then  the  service  in  the  next  alternate 
game  shall  be  delivered  by  the  player  who  did  not  serve  out  of 
his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

28.  There  shall  be  a  referee  for  every  tournament,  whose  name 
shall  be  stated  in  the  circular  announcing  such  tournament.  He 
shall  have  general  charge  of  the  matches  under  the  instructions 
and  advice  of  the  Managing  Committee,  with  such  power  and 
authority  as  may  be  given  him  by  these  rules  and  by  said  com- 
mittee. He  shall  notify  the  committee  in  case  he  intend  to 
leave  the  grounds  during  the  matches,  and  the  committee  shall 
appoint  a  substitute  to  act  with  like  power  during  his  absence. 
There  shall  be  an  umpire  for  each  match  and  as  many  lines- 
men as  the  players  desire.  The  umpire  may  act  as  linesman 
also.  The  umpire  shall  have  general  charge  of  the  match  and 
shall  decide  upon  and  call  lets,  and  also  decide  whether  the 
player  took  the  ball  on  the  first  or  second  bounce.  The  um- 
pire shall  also  decide  any  question  of  interpretation  or  con- 
struction of    the  rules   that  may  arise.     The  decision   of    the 


SPALDING'S    LAWN   TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


umpire  upon  any  question  of  fact,  or  where  a  discretion  is 
allowed  to  him  under  tliese  rules,  shall  be  final.  Any  player, 
however,  may  protest  against  any  interpretation  or  construction 
of  the  rules  by  the  umpire  and  appeal  to  the  referee.  The 
decision  of  the  referee  upon  such  appeal  should  be  final. 

The  Court  shall  be  divided  between  the  linesmen,  and  it 
shall  be  their  only  duty  to  decide  each  for  his  share  of  the 
Court  where  the  ball  touched  the  ground,  except,  however,  the 
linesmen  for  the  base  line,  who  shall  also  call  foot  faults.  The 
linesman's  decision  shall  be  final.  If  a  linesman  is  unable  to 
give  a  decision,  because  he  did  not  see,  or  is  uncertain  of  the 
fact,  the  umpire  shall  decide  or  direct  the  stroke  to  be  played 
again. 

29.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and 
four-handed  games,  except  as  below  :

parallel  with  them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and

32.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  light  ta 
serve  in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so  ; 
and  the  opposing  pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the 
second  game.  The  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the 
first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third,  and  the  partner  of  the 
player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall  serve  in  the 
fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  in  all  the  sub- 
sequent games  of  the  set. 

33.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set  either  partner  of  the 
pair  which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may 
serve,  and  the  same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in 
second  game  of  the  new  set. 

34.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout 
the  game  ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his 
partner  ;  and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  estab- 
lished shall  not  be  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change 
Courts  to  receive  the  service  till  the  end  of  the  set. 

35.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  l)all  served  do  not  drop  between  the 
service  line,  half-court  line  and  service  side  line  of  the  Court, 
diagonally  opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

36.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  as  provided 
:n  law  35,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he 
■'years  or  can  ies. 


Rules  for  Ranaicapping 


At  the  annual  meeting  of  the  United  vStates  National  Lawn 
Tennis  Association,  1897,  it  was  formally  decided  to  adopi; 
the  English  system  of  handicapping  by  sixths  of  fifteen,  but 
without  the  use  of  the  differential  tables.  These  were  abolished 
the  year  before,  when  the  quarter-fifteen  system  supplanted 
the  old  method  of  handicapping  with  bisques.  The  official 
method  now,  therefore,  is  by  sixths  of  fifteen,  both  owed  and 
given,  and  the  rules  for  using  these  handicaps  are  as  follows: 

GIVEN     ODDS. 

One-sixth  of  fifteen  (i)  is  one  stroke  given  by  the  better  to 
the  poorer  player  on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth  and  every 
subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  of  fifteen  (|)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  eighth,  tenth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (|  or  one-half)  of  fifteen  is  one  stroke  given  on 
the  second,  fourth,  sixth  and  every  other  alternate  game  on 
each  set. 

Four- sixths  of  fifteen  (|)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  cor- 
responding games  on  each  set. 

Five-sixths  of  fifteen (|)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
third,  fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  tenth,  eleventh, 
twelfth  and  corresponding  games  on  each  set. 

Fifteen  (15)  is  one  stroke  given  cii  every  game  of  each  set. 

Fifteen  and  one  si-xth  (15. i)  is  two  strokes  given  on  tht. 
same  games  as  for  one-sixth,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  thts 
others. 

Fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the 
same  games  as  for  two-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 


SPALDING  S    LAWN   TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty)  is  two  strokes 
given  on  the  same  games  as  for  three-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on 
each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the 
same  games  as  for  four-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 

Fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  is  two  strokes  on  the  same 
games  as  fo-r  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Tliirty  (30)  is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2), 
thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four- 
sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  are 
three  strokes  and  two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of 
each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen  series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  odds  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  same 
quantities,  the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is 
required  to  earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score, 
while,  in  the  case  of  given  odds,  .the  poorer  player  is  given  his 
handicap  before  play  starts.  These  owed  odds  may  be  used 
either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds  or  separately.  In 
order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as  possible  in 
the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  tiie  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed 
strokes  are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes 
are  taken.     Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds: 

One-sixth  (1)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thir= 
teenth  and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (I)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (|  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first 
third,  fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (|)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth, 
sixth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (|)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth 
fifth,  sixth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Fifteen  (15)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 


SPALDING'S   LAWN  TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.  i),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (i  5.2), 
fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four- 
sixth"  (15.4),  fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5).  thirty  (30),  thirty 
and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and 
three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4). 
thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  correspond  to  the 
fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger  handicaps  in  the  table  for 
given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen  in  that  table. 

When  two  players  meet,  both  of  whom  owe  odds,  or  when 
both  are  in  receipt  of  odds,  the  smaller  handicap  is  subtracted 
from  the  greater,  and  the  difference  between  the  handicaps  is 
the  amount  the  better  player  must  owe  or  give  to  the  poorer,  as 
the  case  may  be.  Should  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
and  the  other  receives  odds,  each  retains  his  original  handicap, 
and  the  tables  are  so  figured  out  that  the  handicaps  will  come 
on  opposite  games  so  far  as  possible.  As  an  illustration  of 
this,  suppose  a  player  (A)  owing  15.3  meets  another  (B)  receiv- 
ing |.  On  the  first  game,  A  owes  30  and  B  starts  from  scratch, 
and  on  the  second,  A  owes  15  and  B  receives  15,  these  two 
di^erent  handicaps  alternating  on  the  games  throughout 
each  set,  the  difference  between  the  players  being  always  the 
same,  30.  A  begins  to  count  on  the  even  games  when  he  has 
made  his  second  stroke,  while  B  counts  30  when  he  scores  his 
lirst,  for  one  is  given  to  him  by  handicap.  On  the  odd  games, 
A  does  not  begin  to  score  until  his  third  stroke,  while  his 
adversary  counts  15  when  he  wins  his  first  ace. 


HINTS  TO  HANDICAPPERS. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out 
the  entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes 
according  to  the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the 
class  with  the  greatest  number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them 
on  scratch,  handicapping  all  cf  the  other  players  either  be- 
hind or  in  advance  of  scratch  by  owed  or  given  odds,  so  as 
to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 


SPALDINC'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

J 11  deciding  upon  each  i^layer's  handicap,  liis  alnlit)-  as  com= 
pared  with  the  scratch  men  should  first  l)e  considered,  and  then 
as  com}iared  \\ith  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  table:; 
of  odds.  Each  player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the 
object  of  handicapping  is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chanc2, 
no  matter  whom  his  opponent  may  be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15  or  any 
fraction  of  it,  than  it  is  to  jjive  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given, 
the  poorer  player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the 
end  of  the  game,  and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best 
men  must  be  very  great  to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance, 
should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorest  players  over  30.'^' 
(half-forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odd; 
run  higher  than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the 
poorest  players  is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary 
behind  scratch,  but  do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30, 
or  30.3  in  the  most  extreme  cases. 

It  is  generally  advisable  to  "seed"  the  draw  in  handicap 
tournaments  so  that  the  players  in  each  class  shall  be  separated 
as  far  as  possible  one  from  another.  In  order  to  preserve  the 
element  of  handicap  matches,  as  few  opportunities  as  possilde 
should  be  given  for  players  to  meet  at  even  odds.  To  insure 
this,  the  players  behind  scratch  should  be  equally  divided 
between  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  draw,  and  those  in  advance 
of  scratch  also  treated  in  the  same  manner.  If  there  are  many 
:n  each  class,  it  is  often  wise  to  split  the  draw  up  into  quarters,, 
10  that  the  players  of  even  ability  shall  be  kept  as  lar  apart  ar. 
Dossible,  and  as  large  a  proportion  of  the  matches  as  posr.ifcl- 
vill  be  played  with  odds  between  the  ccntestf  nts.

Arc  made  by  Scotch  and  English  club-makers  and  are 
entirely  hand-made.  The  heads  are  made  from  the  very 
best  selected  and  seasoned  dogwood,  persimmon  and  com- 
pressed hickory.  The  compressed  clubs  are  faced  with  the 
very  best  English  leather.  The  shafts  are  made  from  the 
very  best  selected  AJ  white,  second-growth  hickory, 
well  seasoned.  These  clubs  are  guaranteed  perfect  as  to 
shape,  lie  and  weights,  while  the  finish  is  the  bested  *^

In  "THE  5PALDING"  grade  we  make  an  endless  variety  of  patterns 
of  either  wood  or  iron,  which  we  keep  at  all  times  in  stock,  a  few  of  which 
we  give  above.  We  can  also  duplicate  any  special  patterns  in  any  quantity 
within  ten  days. 

Unbreakable  feature  of  our  Clubs 

WE  wish  to  draw  particular  attention  to  the  unbreakable  quality 
of  our  clubs.  It  is  an  impossibility  to  break  them  at  the  neck. 
We  have  been  experimenting  for  a  long  time  and  have  dis- 
covered a  process  which,  although  it  increases  the  cost  of  making  a 
head  nearly  50  per  cent.,  leaves  it  practically  unbreakable.  If  placed 
in  a  vise  and  repeatedly  struck  with  a  hammer  the  neck  can  be  bent 
over,  and  by  twisting  back  and  forth  can  be  separated  from  the  head, 
but  it  is  impossible  to  break  one  with  any  kind  of  a  direct  blow.  In 
a  recent  test  made  by  a  well-known  professional,  it  required  all  his 
strength  w  ith  a  large  hammer  to  bend  the  neck  sufficient  to  separate 
it  from  the  head.

Dome  JExercieer. 


A  practical,  simple  and  efficient  Home  Exerciser,  and  one  sp«cially  adapted 
for  ladies  and  children,  but  at  the  same  time  can  be  profitably  used  by  the 
strongest  athlete.  It  is  readily  attached  to  door  frame,  window  casing  or 
any  convenient  place  in  room;  is  absolutely  noiseless  and  takes  up  very 
little  space. 

A  hook  top  and  bottom  is  all  that  is  required  to  suspend  it,  and  it  can  bo 
quickly  removed  when  not  in  use,  and  as  readily  replaced. 

The  variety  of  exercise  this  little  apparatus  is  capable  of  is  simple  endless, 
And  permits  of  the  uniform  development  of  the  muscles  instead  of  the  uneven 
one  so  common  to  all  the  usual  home  exercises.  Our  Manual  No.  29^  on 
Physical  Culture  (price,  postpaid,  10  cents),  will  give  many  valuable  hints 
as  to  the  most  beneficial  exercises,  and  by  simply  reversing  the  apparatus, 
all  the  lower  movements  shown  may  be  adapted  to  this  outfit
