No  single  Order  can  be  granted  for  more  than  £10,  nor  more 
than  one  £10  Order  to  one  person,  payable  to  any  one  person 
or  firm,  in  any  one  calendar  month* 

Money  Orders  are  issued  and  paid  in  St.  Georges  and  Ham- 
ilton between  the  hours  of  Ten  and  Four  every  day,  Sundays 
excepted. 

No  Money  Order  shall  be  issued  from  either  of  the  Post  Offi- 
ces at  St.  Georges  or  Hamilton  within  24  hours  next  before  the 
time  when  the  Packet  carrying  Her  Majesty's  Mail  is  expected 
to  arrive  at  Bermuda,  nor  from  such  time  until,  after  the  de- 
parture of  that  Mail  from  Bermuda, 

No  Order  is  allowed  to  contain  a  fractional  part  of  a  penny. 

An  Order  once  issued  cannot  be  cancelled,  and  should  re- 
payment or  transfer  to  a  different  office,  or  alteration  of  name 
be  required,  the  remitter  must  apply  to  the  paying  Postmaster 
according  to  the  directions  printed  on  the  back  of  the  Order. 

No  application  can  be  entertained  for  compensation  for  al-

the  Office  is  not  liable  to  any  further  claim. 

The  Public  are  recommended,  when  applying  for  Money  Or- 
ders, to  use  printed  "Application  Forms,"  which  save  time  and 
afford  greater  security,  than  verbal  messages,  against  mistakes. 
These  Forms  are  supplied  gratuitouslv  at  the  Money  Order 
Offices.

SIGNALS  AKD  TELEGRAPHING. 


There  are  four  Signal  Posts  in  the  Colony,  at  Fort  George 
(St.  Georges),  Mount  Langton  (the  Governor's  residence),  Gibbs' 
Hill  (the  Light  House),  and  Ireland  (the  Dockyard). 

There  are  also  at  Mount  Langton  a  Staff  for  the  Governor's 
Flag,  and  one  at  some  little  distance  used  exclusively  for  sig- 
naling the  Mail. 

Formerly  all  telegraphic  communication  was  made  between 
the  stations  by  means  of  a  flag  at  the  mast  head  and  balls  on 
the  yard-arm,  but  the  Electric  Telegraph  having  been  laid 
between  the  several  military  stations  throughout  the  Bermudas, 
the  Royal  Naval  Establishment,  Mount  Langton  and  the 
Towns  ot  St.  George  and  Hamilton,  all  telegraphic  communi- 
cation by  signals  has  ceased. 

The  signal  stations  are  used  to  denote  the  approach,  and  in 
some  cases  the  departure  of  Vessels. 

Telegraphing  is  distinguished  by  a  square  flag  of  Red, 
White  and  Blue  vertical  being  hoisted  at  the  mast-head,  and 
balls  at  various  parts  of  the  yard-arm. 

Vessels  Seek  from  any  part  of  the  Island  are  distinguished 
by  Pendants  hoisted  at  the  mast-bead,  by  Balls  at  the  yard- 
arm  to  denote  the  position  in,  which  they  are,  and  by  Flags, 
also  at  the  yard-arm  and  under  the  balls,  to.  show  what  the 
Vessels  may  be  doing  or  require- 

The  following  are  the  Signals  denoting  Vessels 

A  Ship  A  blue  Pendant. 

A  Barque   ,  A  blue  and  white  do. 

A  Brig  A  red  do. 

A  Brigantine   ....A  red  and  white  do.

[  A  pendant  red  &  white  ver- 
tical  alternately. 


Foreign  Men-of-war  have  their"] 
national  flag  hoisted  over  the 
proper  Pendant,  but  if  their 
nationality  is  not  known  or 
cannot  be  shown,  they  are  de- 
noted by 

*  This  pendant  hoisted  under  the  Union  Jack,  is  the  ".de- 
mand" to  ask  a  Man-of-war's  number,  if  hoisted  close  up  at  the 
yard-arm,  it  denotes  that  the  St.  Georges  Ferry  is  impassable, 
if  half-way  up  that  crossing  is  difficult. 

The  Position  of  Vessels  is  shown  by  balls  an  the  yard-arm, 
a  ball  for  every  Vessel  seen. 

The  yard-arm  points  North  and  South. 

A  ball  at  the  North  end  denotes  that  the  Vessel  whose  Pen-; 
dant  is  uppermost  on  the  mast  is  in  the  North-east  quarter  of 
the  compass.  A  ball  on  the  inner  part  of  the  North  end  of  the 
yard,  shows  a  vessel  to  be  in  the  North-West  quarter.  A  ball 
at  the  South  end,  shows  a  Vessel  in  the  South-East  quarter,  and 
one  on  the  inner  part  of  the  South  end,  denotes  a  Vessel  in  the 
South-West  quarter. 

All  Signals  of  Vessels  are  hoisted  in  the  above  order  of  Nor  th- 
East,  North-West,  South-East,  South-West. 

The  Movements  of  Vessels  are  denoted  by  flags,  principally 
the  numbers  of  Marryat's  Merchant  Code,  hoisted  under  the 
balls  which  denote  their  position.

of  vessels  belonging  to  the  Island  is  discontinued,  but  if  the 
owners  or  consignees  think  proper  to  provide  a  private  signal 
to  distinguish  their  vesseis  it  will  be  hoisted  at  the  yard-arm 
whenever  they  are  reported.

THE  MILITARY  ELECTRIC  TELEGRAPH. 


The  Electric  Telegraph  which  runs  the  whole  length  of  Ber- 
muda, from  Fort  Cunningham,  at  the  Eastern,  to  Ireland,  at 
the  Western  extremity  of  the  Islands,  is  a  military  work,  exe- 
cuted by  the  War  Department.  It  is  worked  by  soldiers,  and 
is  in  charge  of  the  Royal  Engineers. 

The  Line  is  a  single  galvanized  iron  wire,  of  the  size  (No,  8) 
generally  used  in  England,  supported  on  glazed  porcelain  in- 
sulators fixed  to  cedar  p03ts  from  70  to  100  yards  apart.  The 
wire  at  the  centre  of  the  span  is  generally  about  14  feet  from 
the  ground,  but  in  many  places,  a3  for  instance  when  it  crosses 
the  streets,  it  is  much  more. 

The  Instruments  used  are  the  Single  Needle  Telegraph  In- 
struments (Reid's  pattern),  some  of  them  having  been  made  by 
the  Royal  Engineer  Department,  The  Batteries  are  Muirhead'3 
pattern,  and  are  necessarily  powerful,  a3  the  resistance  of  the 
line  and  instruments  together  is  equal  to  about  that  of  148 
miles  of  line  wire,  each  instrument  having  a  resistance  equal 
to  10  miles  of  wire. 

The  course  of  the  line  is  as  follows :—  Starting  from  Fort 
Cunningham  it  passes  by  air  lines,  at  a  sufficient  height  to 
allow  boats  to  pass  under,  from  Paget's  Island  toHiggs'  Island, 
and  again  across  the  Town  Cut  to  St*  Georges  Island.  It  then 
follows  the  Cut  Road  to  the  Royal  Barracks,  thence  across  by 
the  Royal  Engineer  Office  and  the  Naval  Tanks  to  the  North 
Shore,  which  it  follows  as  far  as  the  Ferry.  The  Ferry  is 
crossed  by  a  submarine  cable.  The  line  then  follows  the  North 
Road  by  Bailey's  Bay,  the  Flatt's,  and  Devonshire  Dock,  to 
Mount  Langton.  At  these  four  points  loop  lines  are  connected 
leading  respectively  to  Paynter's  Vale  (the  Royal  Engineer 
Quarry  on  the  S.  W  Shore  of  Castle  Harbour),  Knapton  Hill 
(on  the  South  side  of  Harrington  Sound),  Prospect  Hill  (the 
Military  Camp),  and  Clarence  Hill  (the  Admiral's  residence) . 
From  Mount  Langton  the  line  takes  an  almost  direct  course  to 
the  Telegraph  Office  in  Hamilton,  which  is  situated  near  the 
Public  Buildings.  From  here  it  passes  round  the  head  of  the 
Harbour,  and  then  follows  pretty  nearly  the  line  of  the  main 
road  through  the  Parishes  of  Paget,  Warwick,  Southampton 
(a  loop  line  running  up  to  the  Signal  Station  at  Gibbs'  Hill), 
and,  Sandy's  (Somerset  Bridge  being  crossed  by  an  air  line  at  a 
considerable  height  above  the  water)  to  Somerset  Ferry.  Here 
the  water  is  again  crossed  by  a  submarine  cable  to  Watford 
Island,  whence  an  air  line  runs  through  Boaz  and  Ireland  to 
the  Signal  Station  in  the  latter  Island,

There  are  at  present  Eleven  Telegraph  Offices,  viz. :  — 

Fort  Cunningham  At  the  Royal  Engineer  Office 

St.  Georges   do      do  do 

Paynter's  Vale   do      do  do 

Prospect  Hill    do      do  do 

Clarence  Hill  At  the  Admiral's  Signal  Station 

Mount  Langton  At  the  Signal  Station 

Hamilton  ........ c  Close  to  the  Public  Buildings 

Gibbs'  Hill   At  the  Signal  Station 

Boaz  Island  At  the  Royal  Engineer  Office 

Ireland  Island  At  the  Signal  Station 

Knapton  Hill  At  the  Royal  Engineer  Office, 

The  Office  at  Clarence  Hill  is  only  open  during  the  residence 
of  the  Admiral,  the  loop  line  being  thrown  out  of  circuit  at 
other  times.  The  Office  at  Knapton  Hill  is  only  a  temporary 
one,  and  will  be  closed  when  the  troops  employed  on  the  South 
Coast  Road,  now  in  course  of  construction,  make  a  new  en- 
campment further  West,  to  which  a  new  line  will  be  laid  down. 

The  line  between  St.  Georges  and  Mount  Langton  was  con- 
structed in  1866,  these  two  offices  being  opened  in  July  of  that 
year.  For  some  little  time  these  were  the  only  two  offices 
opened  ;  communication  with  Gibbs'  Hill  and  Ireland  being 
kept  up  as  formerly  by  means  of  the  flag  and  ball  system.  The 
line  was  soon,  however,  extended  to  Hamilton,  where  an 
office  was  opened  in  Sept.,  1866.  This  work,  though  executed 
like  the  whole  of  the  remainder  of  the  line,  under  the  superin- 
tendence of  Lieut.  Orange,  R.  E.,  by  Military  labour,  was  laid 
at  the  expense  of  the  Colonial  Government,  which  at  present 
bears  the  expense  of  keeping  up  the  offices  at  Mount  Langton 
and  Hamilton,  taking  in  return  the  money  received  for  private 
telegrams  at  the  latter  station.  In  February,  1867,  the  loop 
line  to  Clarence  Hill  was  laid,  but  was  not  put  in  circuit 
till  the  Admiral  took  up  his  residence  there  last  winter.  In 
1867  the  War  Department  authorised  the  extension  of  the  line 
to  Gibbs'  Hill  and  Ireland,  and  this  was  executed  in  the  latter 
part  of  the  year,  offices  being  opened  at  those  stations  in  Janu- 
ary 1868.  In  May  1868,  loop  lines  were  constructed  and  offices 
opened  at  Prospect  Hill  and  Boaz  Island.  In  June  the  line  to 
Paynter's  Vale  was  completed  and  an  office  opened  there.  In 
September  the  offices  at  Fort  Cunningham  and  Knapton  Hill 
were  opened.  Thus  there  is  now  ready  communication  with 
almost  every  part  of  the  Islands. 

The  principal  object  of  the  Telegraph  is  of  course  to  establish 
an  instant  communication  between  the  Major  General  Com- 
manding and  the  various  Detachments  of  the  Troops  stationed 


45 


all  over  the  Islands,  but  the  Public  are  allowed  to  make  use  of 
it  for  the  transmission  of  messages  on  certain  terms. 

All  Telegrams  from  or  to  His  Excellency  the  Major  General 
Commanding  are  sent  free  of  charge  and  take  precedence  of  all 
others. 

All  Telegrams  on  Public  Service,  whether  Military,  Naval} 
or  Colonial,  are  sent  free  of  charge  if  from  (and  signed  by)  or 
to  an  officer  of  either  the  Imperial  or  Colonial  Government. 

Private  telegrams  (whether  answers  to  others  or  not)  from 
officers,  non-commissioned  officers  or  men  of  Her  Majesty's 
Army  or  Navy  are  charged  for  at  the  rate  of  Zd.  for  every  20 
or  part  of  20  words,  exclusive  of  the  address. 

Private  Telegrams  (whether  answers  to  others  or  not)  from 
civilians  are  charged  for  at  the  rate  of  Is.  for  the  first  20  words 
(exclusive  of  address),  and  6d.  extra  for  every  additional  10 
words,  or  part  of  10  words. 

At  St.  Georges,  Hamilton,  Gibbs'  Hill,  and  Ireland,  messen- 
gers are  kept  who  are  bound  to  deliver  all  messages  within 
certain  limits,  which  can  be  ascertained  on  application  to  any 
of  the  offices.  For  all  telegrams  required  to  be  delivered  at 
any  distance  from  any  of  the  other  stations,  or  beyond  these 
limits,  special  messengers  will,  if  possible,  be  procured,  a  charge 
of  6d.  a  mile  (prepaid  at  the  sending  station)  being  charged  for 
porterage.  Messages  to  be  delivered  from  Boaz  will  be  charged 
2d.  additional  to  cover  the  messenger's  fare  across  the  Ferry. 

The  hours  during  which  the  Telegraph  Offices  are  open  are 
as  follows  : —

Hill,  and  Boaz  however  do  not  open  till  9  a.m.,  closing  at  5

The  immense  convenience  of  the  Electric  Telegraph  is  proved 
by  the  number  of  messages  transmitted,  the  average  number 
transmitted  in  each  quarter  being  about  4,200.

BERMUDA  JLIOII11  HOUSE. 


The  Light  is  a  "revolving  dioptric  lens  of  the  first  order  with 
mirrors"  with  one  centre  Lamp  of  three  concentric  wicks ;  and 
is  among  the  largest  and  most  powerful  in  the  world.  It  shows 
a  bright  flash  continuing  for  six  or  eight  seconds,  and  repeated 
once  every  minute.  This  Light  House  was  constructed  in  Lon- 
don from  the  designs  of  Mr.  Alexander  Gordon,  C.E.,  and  wa3 
erected  under  the  superintendence  of  Mr,  Grove.  The  first  plate 
was  erected  on  Dec.  19th,  1844,  and  the  last  plate  of  the  tower 
on  Oct.  9th,  1845.  The  Light  was  first  shown  May  1,  1846.  At 
the  lower  portion  of  the  tower  stability  is  given  by  concrete  fill- 
ed in  22  feet  high,  where  the  first  floor  is.  Above  this  there  are 
seven  rooms  12  feet  high,  supported  by  a  centre  hollow  column 
which  serves  for  the  weight  of  the  revolving  machinery  of  the 
light,  &c.  The  height  of  the  gallery  is  105  feet  9  inches ;  diame- 
ter at  base,  24  feet ;  diameter  at  the  top,  14  feet ;  height  from 
the  gallery  to  the  centre  of  light,  11  feet ;  from  centre  of  light 
|  to  top  of  vane,  17  feet total,  13S  feet  9  inche3< 

The  cost,  inclusive  of  the  light  machinery,  was  £5,500.

THE  GARDENER'S  CAEENOAR. 


Revised  and  Corrected  Expressly  for  the  Bermuda  Pocket 
Almanack  for  1869,  by  a  Practical  Agriculturalist. 

January. — Irish  Potatoes. — This  valuable  esculent  is  now  the 
staple  crop  of  the  Islands,  and  each  succeeding  year  affords 
additional  proof  of  its  value.  Land  for  potatoes  should  be  well 
manured,  well  cleaned,  and  made  loose ;  any  land  will  answer 
for  Potatoes  provided  it  be  sheltered.  The  Western  Red  is  the 
best  description  for  Bermuda  cultivation ;  they  yield  more  than 
any  other.  For  this  description  the  manure  should  be  ploughed 
or  otherwise  turned  into  the  land,  sufficient  time  before  planting, 
to  allow  it  to  incorporate  with  the  soil.  If  this  be  done  they  are 
the  best  for  early  planting,  say  from  10th  December  to  the  10th 
January.  The  Eed  Garnet  should  be  planted  from  the  10th  Feb- 
ruary to  the  10th  March.  Plant  them  from  20  to  24  inches 
between  the  rows.  Mould  them  once  only.  Never  mould  im- 
mediately after  rain,  but  rather  wait  a  day  or  two  until  the 
land  is  a  little  dry.  They  may  be  planted  in  trenches  with  the 
hoe ;  ploughed  in,  or  distributed  in,  just  as  it  may  suit  the  planter* 
Stable  manure  is  the  best;  it  should  be  ploughed  or  dug  into  the 
land  two  months  at  the  least  before  the  crop  is  put  in.  By  this 
mode  the  potatoe  is  not  so  liabb  to  rot,  even  it  attacked  with  the 
blight,  and  it  the  rule  be  strictly  observed  we  would  not  hear  so 
much  about  rotten  potatoes.  As  to  guano,  it  is  of  little  use  except 
the  land  is  in  heart,  or  in  other  words  has  been  well  manured  the 
previous  year;  there  is  scarcely  any  manure  better  than  seaweed 
just  out  of  the  water,  dug  into  the  land  a  few  weeks  before  plant- 
ing.— Garnets  can  be  planted  later,  say  from  1st  February  to 
20th  March. 

Onions. — The  land  to  receive  this  crop  should  be  well  dug  and 
cleaned,  and  manured  with  well  rotted  manure — that  from  the 
stable  is  the  best.  Be  more  liberal  with  manure  to  the  potatoe 
and  less  so  than  is  customary  with  the  onion,  and  both  will  yield 
better  crops.  Commence  planting  about  the  First  if  the  land  is 
not  too  wet ;  the  plants  should  be  set  about  eight  inches  apart,  not 
too  deep,  as  they  will  head  much  sooner.  Care  should  be  taken 
to  put  the  root  down  straight,  to  send  its  fibres  perpendicularly 
downwards.  Onions  sown  thin  in  beds  and  not  transplanted,  will 
produce  the  earliest  and  the  best  onions  for  keeping — a  greater 
weight  in  the  same  extent  of  land,  and  at  least  at  half  the  usual 
expense ;  the  seed  should  be  sown  in  February  to  stand  for  a  crop. 
The  onion  is  much  improved  in  quality  if  not  transplanted  before 
the  10th,  not  being  so  liable  to  split. ,  They  should  in  no  case  be 


5g 


allowed  to  fully  ripen  before  being  pulled,  as  the  disposition  to 
decay  commences  on  its  arriving  at  full  maturity.  The  dividing, 
and,  in  many  cases,  sub-dividing  of  onions  is,  in  my  opinion,  to  be 
attributed  to  too  early  planting  and  excessive  use  of  guano. 

Carrots — may  be  sown  for  a  late  crop ;  when  growing  they 
should  be  kept  very  clean,  and  the  soil  loose. 

Turnips. — A  few  White  Globe  or  Red  Top  may  be  sown  in 
warm  places^  but  the  ground  in  general  is  too  cold  for  seed. 
Swedish  will  give  a  good  crop  in  May  if  sown  broadcast  and  very 
thin. 

Cabbage. — Plant  out  Green  Glazed  Slips  for  a  crop  in  May. — 
Keep  those  already  out  very  clean  and  the  ground  loose. 

Cauliflowers — are  not  profitable*  the  plant  being  very  tender 
and  requiring  great  care  to  bring  it  to  perfection. 

Cucumber s.-^-Plant  in  shekel  ed  places  and  in  good  soil — if 
taken  care  of  they  will  sell  well  in  the  New  York  market. 

Tomatoes. — Plant  out  in  sheltered  places,  in  rich  light  soil, 
about  four  feet  apart$  and  keep  very  clean. 

Pot  Herbs.— Plant  out  and  keep  very  clean. 

Peas.— -Plant  Dwarf  Marrowfat  in  sheltered  places  for  a  crop 
in  May. — The  common  round  will  give  a  good  crop  and  a  great 
deal  of  fodder  also. 

Beans. — Plant  Six-week  and  Windsor  in  rich  land. 

February* — Irish  Potatoes — should  be  all  planted  by  the  first 
of  the  month,  otherwise  the  crop  will  not  pay.  Keep  the  soil 
loose  and  do  not  mould  too  high,  and  only  once,  as  potatoes 
moulded  too  much  give  a  greater  number  of  small  ones  and  do  not 
ripen  early. 

Omofts^-should  all  be  down  by  the  first  for  an  early  crop ;  they 
can  be  planted  in  March  for  a  late  crop.  Those  set  out  last  month 
should  be  cleaned  and  the  soil  made  loose.  Onions  planted  this 
month  in  good  red  soil  will  be  fit  to  pull  as  early  as  those  planted 
last  month  in  light  soiU 

Arrowroot.—  This  is  a  good  time  to  take  up  the  root. 

Turnips. — White  Globe  or  Eed  Top  should  be  sown  in  all  waste 
land  to  keep  down  the  weeds  and  to  serve  as  manure. 

Beans. — White  and  Six-week  Beans  or  any  other  sort  can  be 
planted. 

Cabbage—Set  out  Green  Glazed  Slips.  Keep  those  planted 
clean  and  moulded.  Dig  in  manure  round  them,  it  makes  them 
head  much  sooner, 

Oats — can  be  sown  in  all  waste  land  for  fodder  or  crop, 
Indian  Corn. — The  thin  white  can  be  planted  for  an  early  crop. 


Carrots. — A  little  Early  Horn  and  the  White  Field  can  be  sown 
for  a  late  crop. 

Sweet  Potatoes. — Plant  in  warm  places  to  get  early  slips  or 
springers.  The  largest  potatoe  gives  the  earliest  slips.  Springers 
taken  from  a  hot  bed  are  said  to  be  the  surest.  Those  left  in  the 
land  when  dug  give  the  strongest  and  best  slips  and  springers. 

Salad. — Sow  a  few  Lettuce  in  warm  places-^-and  Raddish. 

Fruit  Vines — often  do  well  if  the  seed  be  planted  in  rich  soil 
about  the  middle  of  the  month. 

Marcii. — Arrowroot— should  be  all  taken  up  this  month ;  it  is 
also  a  good  time  for  planting  it. 

Onions,— Keep  very  clean  and  soil  loose.    It  is  time  to  get  tops 
for  making  baskets. 

Irish  Potatoes.— Mould  but  ence.  Loosen  the  soil  before  mould- 
ing. Plant  2nd  size  Bermuda  Potatoes  about  the  10th,  they  will 
give  a  crop  in  July; 

The  blight  generally  makes  its  appearance  about  the  20th  of 
March,  and  generally  with  Southwest  or  East  winds,  if  accompa- 
nied with  fine  rain  or  fogi  In  1860  it  appeared  on  the  3rd  Fe- 
bruary. Potatoes  therefore  should  be  planted  early  to  be  strong 
enough  to  withstand  the  disease. 

Sweet  Potatoes. — This  is  a  good  time  to  put  clown  this  crop  in 
light  soil  with  plenty  of  green  manure.  Plant  them  shallow. 
Large  pieces  should  be  planted  out  to  get  early  slips  from;  if  the 
planting  roots  are  left  standing  till  October  they  will  give  a  good 
crop  of  very  fine  potatoes.  New  land  is  preferable  for  Sweet 
Potatoes.  If  planted  between  every  other  row  of  Irish  Potatoes 
they  will  give  the  earliest  and  best  slips  and  a  good  crop,  and  save 
ground  ;  that  is,  if  the  land  is  well  manured. 

Indian  Corn — should  be  planted  lor  a  crop  and  for  fodder,  and 
planted  between  the  rows  of  Irish  Potatoes ;  the  thin  white  kind  j 
is  the  best,  it  requires  rich  soil  well  manured  to  bring  it  to  perfec-  ; 
tion.    It  should  be  placed  three  feet  apart. 

Tomatoes — should  be  kept  very  clean,  and  sage  bushes  should 
be  put  under  the  vines  to  keep  the  fruit  from  the  ground  or  it 
will  rot. 

Fruit  Vines. — Cucumbers  and  Melons  should  be  put  down  I 
about  the  middle  of  the  month.    They  do  best  in  single  rows  like 
peas,  placed  about  six  feet  apart,  4  good  plants  in  each  hill ;  they 
should  be  stuck  like  peas. — Cucumbei'3  and  Melons  should  not  be 
planted  near  each  other. — Manure  from  the  pig  stye  is  the  best  ; 
lor  them. 

Beans.—  Broad  Windsor  and  White  Beans,  Six-week,  may  be 
put  down, 


60 


Peas. — Plant  any  kind  in  spare  land  manured  for  the  purpose. 
Trees. — Plant  Fruit  and  other  Trees.    Oleander  cuttings  for 
Hedges.    The  Oleander  and  Spruce  should  be  planted  round  all 
land  exposed  to  the  Xorth  and  West  winds.    Keep  them  trimmed 
|  and  in  three  years  they  will  give  an  excellent  hedge,  and  much 
wood  for  culinary  purposes. 

April. — Arroivroot.— This  is  the  best  month  for  planting  it. 

Irish  Potatoes — should  not  be  taken  up  until  the  stalk  is  dead, 
j  as  the  growih  continues  till  that  time.  About  the  middle  of  this 
,  month  the  early  planted  ones  will  be  fit  to  take  up.  Great  care 
!  should  be  taken  not  to  let  them  lie  in  the  sun,  as  it  injures  the 
flavour  and  causes  them  to  rot.    Pick  them  up  in  baskets  not  in  bags. 

Onions  — Clean  and  loosen  them  for  the  last  time ;  pull  up  any 
corn  that  may  have  been  planted  through  them,  as  anything  that 
shades  them  will  keep  them  from  heading.  The  baskets  should 
be  in  progress  of  making. 

Sweet  Potatoes. — Dig  the  ground  you  intend  to  plant  with  green 
manure,  such  as  sage-bush,  brush  or  sea-weed — the  latter  is  best. 
You  must  finish  planting  them  this  month.  They  should  be 
planted  in  good  rich  soil  to  ensure  strong  and  early  slips. 

Turnips. — A  few  White  Globe  or  Red  Top  can  be  sown  in  waste 
land,  and  will  yield  a  good  crop  if  the  weather  should  be  favour- 
able. 

Pumpkins. — Plant  seeds  or  slips  among  the  Irish  Potatoes  while 

growing ;  when  the  Irish  Potatoes  are  taken  up  you  have  a  crop 

of  young  vines  in  a  forward  state. 

Fruit  Vines. — Cucumbers  and  Melons  can  be  planted  now  if 

not  already.    Those  growing  must  be  cleaned  and  a  little  soot  and 

ashes  strewn  around. 
I     Tomatoes. — K^cp  plenty  of  sage  bushes  under  the  vines  as  they 

run.  Let  the  sun  get  to  them  as  much  as  possible  to  ripen  the 
l!  fruit.  Ship  some  this  month  if  you  can.  The  fruit  must  not  be 
ii  too  ripe  to  ship  ;  they  must  be  turning  red  at  the  flower  end  ;  the 
'■  packages  should  be  boxes  made  of  laths  eighteen  inches  long, 
i  eight  inches  broad,  and  six  inches  deep,  which  will  hold  about  six 
'  dozen  with  layers  of  paper  or  hay.    Tomatoes  packed  in  a  tight 

box  in  bran  have  kept  twenty  days  quite  sound. 

Indian  Com —should  be  planted  for  fodder  and  crop  in  spare 

land. 

Guinea  Com. — The  seed  should  be  sown  in  beds  for  transplant- 
ing, or  in  drills  for  a  crop.    Very  thin. 

China  Sugar  Cane. — Is  far  preferable  to  Guinea  Corn,  as  you 
:  can  preserve  your  own  seed,  and  obtain  two  good  crops  per  year. 
It  will  stand  two  or  three  years  if  kept  clean — all  kind  of  cattle 


CI 


cat  it  greedily,  poultry  are  partial  to  the  seed,  which  can  be  raised 
in  large  quantities. 

Oats. — Plant  all  spare  ground  for  fodder  or  for  manure.  Plant 
cuttings;  transplant  flowers  and  shrubs. 

Guinea  Crass. — Transplant  round  the  borders.  Much  safer  to 
plant  alter  a  good  rain  in  June. 

Peas. — Bird-eye  lor  fodder  or  manure  at  3  feet  apart. 

May.—  Arrowroot.  —Finish  planting.  This  is  a  very  good  month 
for  it  in  new  red  soil. 

Onions  ^-should  be  kept  very  clean  from  weeds,  the  early  ones 
will  be  fit  to  pull  from  about  the  Ffteenth  to  the  Twenty-fifth. 
Care  should  be  taken  to  pull  them  up  as  soon  as  the  stalk  falls,  as 
they  will  not  keep  long  if  allowed  to  stand  in  the  ground  after 
they  are  ripe. 

Irish  Potatoes.-— -They  generally  will  begin  to  ripen,  and  should 
be  taken  up  but  not  exposed  to  the  sun.  They  should  be  out  of 
the  ground  at  least  two  weeks  before  they  are  shipped,  and  before 
being  packed  should  be  carefully  picked  over,  as  all  those  that  are 
bad  will  show  the  rot  within  that  time.  The  sound  ones  will  then 
keep  for  almost  any  length  of  time.  More  care  must  be  taken  in 
picking  and  packing  them  before  they  will  fetch  their  full  value  in 
distant  markets. 

Fruit. — Bud  and  engraft  Sweet  Oiange  or  healthy  young  Lemon 
or  Seville  Orange  Trees.  Keep  water  to  the  roots  and  damp  the 
buds  or  graft  in  dry  weather. 

Peas. — Plant  a  few  Bird-eye  in  the  Irish  Potatoe  ground  for  an 
early  crop,  fodder  or  manure  for  slips. 

Pumpkins. — Plant  the  slips  in  all  waste  land,  side  of  Hill,  &c. 
The  slip  will  yield  as  good  a  crop  as  the  seed,  and  should  be  more 
extensive^  planted.  The  best  way  is  to  plant  them  between  the 
rows  ol  Irish  Potatoes,  about  8  or  10  feet  apart ;  when  the  potatoes 
are  taken  up  they  will  soon  cover  the  ground. 

Guinea  Corn  and  China  Sugar  Cane—  should  be  planted  out  in 
all  spare  land,  they  grow  in  any  soil,  and  are  valuable  crops  for 
fodder. 

Sweet  Potatoes. — Put  down  all  the  springers  and  slips  you  can 
obtain  ;  they  will  give  a  good  crop  in  September.  Plant  them  in 
ridges,  as  they  do  better,  the  ridges  eighteen  inches  apart,  the 
slips  one  foot. 

Melons. — Clean  and  trench  the  Vines  as  they  run,  and  nip  off 
the  tips  of  the  vines,  which  will  make  them  spread  and  put  out 
more  fruit;  dust  them  over  with  a  little  soot  and  ashes. 

June. — Arrowroot. — Clean  and  transplant  if  too  thick.

|  Irish  Potatoes — should  not  be  taken  out  of  the  ground  for  a 
;  week  or  two  after  the  stalk  has  died  off ;  then  those  that  are  dis- 
eased will  decay,  the  others  will  keep  till  October.  Should  be  all 
up  by  the  end  of  this  month,  or  they  will  become  waterish  and 
will  not  keep  long  after  being  taken  up.  Those  intended  for  home 
use  should  be  kept  dry  and  from  the  light,  or  they  will  turn  green 
and  lose  their  flavour. 

Onions — should  be  taken  up  as  soon  as  the  stalk  begins  to  fall, 
and  removed  from  the  place  ot  growth  and  spread  on  grass  land, 
on  the  side  of  a  hill,  or  rising  ground,  so  that  the  moisture  may 
more  readily  escape.  Those  not  shipped  should  be  put  up  in 
bunches  and  hung  in  a  dry  place.    They  will  keep  a  long  time. 

Sweet  Potatoes. —Put  down  all  the  slips  you  can  get ;  let  them 
be  placed  thin  to  give  them  room  to  grow,  say  15  or  18  inches 
apart.  They  will  not  do  well  where  the  Irish  Potatoe  has  been 
planted,  unless  in  new  and  very  rich  soil,  and  should  then  stand 
till  January. 

Pumpkins. — Trench  and  manure  the  Tines  as  they  run,  pick  off 
the  tip  end  of  the  slip  as  soon  as  you  see  the  small  pumpkin, 
which  will  make  it  hokh 

Peas. — Plant  the  Bird-eye  for  a  full  crop  \  this  is  a  valuable  but 
neglected  crop,  as  they  can  be  planted  in  any  soil,  will  yield  a 
good  return  in  Peas,  which  will  sell  readily,  give  abundance  of 
fodder  for  cattle,  and  employ  ground  which  would  otherwise  be  \ 
full  of  weeds. 

Melons — will  begin  to  ripen.  Do  not  plant  Cucumbers  and 
Melons  near  each  other,  or  the  bees  will  spoil  both*  It  is  very 
necessary  to  observe  this. 

Guinea  Corn  and  China  Sugar  Cane. — Finish  planting  or  sowing 
all  you  intend  to  put  down. 

July, — Arrowroot — If  the  weather  is  wet*  clean,— -if  dry,  wait 
till  next  month. 

Onions. — If  any  left,  bunch  them  ;  look  to  the  seed  and  take  it 
in  as  the  pods  open  wide  enough  for  you  to  see  it )  take  great  care 
that  it  does  not  mildew  and  spoiL 

Irish  Potatoes.— Keep  any  that  are  left  dry  and  in  as  dark  a 
place  as  possible. 

Peas.— Plant  Bird-eye  in  all  spare  ground  ;  clean  and  mould 
those  planted. 

Sweet  Potatoes. — If  the  weather  is  fit,  plant  all  the  slips  you  can 
for  a  crop.  Do  not  cut  slips  from  planted  slips,  but  let  them  grow 
and  they  will  give  a  much  better  crop. 

August. — Arrowroot. — If  the  weather  is  seasonable,  Arrowroot 


63 


can  be  transplanted  to  the  20th  August. 

Irish  Potatoes. — Pick  them  over  for  seed,  and  see  that  they  are 
in  good  order  lor  planting;  put  down  some  about  the  20th  or  after 
the  first  fall  of  rain  in  August  for  a  crop  in  November,  if  the 
weather  is  not  too  dry.  About  the  1st  September  is  better.  Plant 
them  much  thicker  than  the  general  crop,  say  about  6  inches  apart 
in  the  drill,  20  inches  between  drills;  mould  them  and  they  will 
withstand  the  wind  and  give  a  better  crop.  Do  not  plant  the  very 
small  ones. 

Onions. — Pick  over  those  intended  for  seed  and  have  them  in 
good  order  for  planting  next  month. 

Carrots. — If  any  good  seed,  put  down  some  Early  Horn  for  an 
early  crop.  Old  seed  will  not  answer.  Large  White  Field  is  a 
good  kind  for  cattle  and  yields  a  large  crop 

Turnips. — Sow  a  little  White  Globe  or  Red  Top,  old  seed  will 
come  up. 

Cabbage. — Plant  the  Green  Glazed  slips  for  an  early  crop. 
Oats. — Sow  in  all  spare  land  for  an  early  fodder, 
Sweet  Potatoes. — Finish  planting  if  possible  to  make  sure  of  a 
crop. 

September. — Sweet  Potatoes. — The  slips  planted  this  month 
rannot  be  depended  upon  to  produce  a  good  crop.  They  do  well, 
however,  for  fodder  or  for  stock. 

Irish  Potatoes — should  be  down  early  that  they  may  obtain 
strength  against  the  hard  winds  in  November,  and  will  be  out  of 
the  ground  lor  an  early  crop  in  January. 

Oats. — Plant  all  spare  ground,  they  will  keep  the  weeds  down. 

Turnips.-^Sow  Early  Dutch,  Red  Top  and  Swedish,  not  too 
thick,  in  light  soil  well  manured. 

Cabbage. — Sow  early  York,  early  Drum-head,  large  late  Drum- 
head, the  Green  Glazed  from  the  slips  is  the  best  for  large  crops 
as  the  insects  do  not  take  them.  The  Drum-head  and  the  Early 
York  are  the  best  for  table. 

Carrots  — Sow  Long  Orange  and  the  White  Field  for  a  late 
crop,  Early  Horn  for  an  early  crop,  sow  in  light  soil ;  they 
are  the  best  winter  food  for  cattle  ;  the  early  Horn  will  give  the 
best  crop,  and  are  the  finest  for  table ;  will  grow  in  any  soil. 
They  are  the  best  and  cheapest  lood  for  horses  during  the  winter 
months. 

Beat  and  Mangle  Wortzel.Sow  in  drills  two  ieet  apart ;  soak 
the  seed  24  hours  in  warm  water  before  sowing.  As  they  come 
up  thin  them.    They  are  excellent  food  for  cattle  and  hogs. 

Beans. — Plant  French,  Six-week,  and  Broad  Windsor. 

Peas. — Plant  Marrow-fat  and   Blue  Prussian  in  light  soil, 


64 


sheltered  from  the  North  and  West  winds. 

Salad. — Sow  Radish  and  Lettuce  in  light  soil. 

Tomatoes. — Sow  in  beds  the  same  as  Cabbage  in  rich  light 
soil ;  keep  the  plants  clean. 

Onions. —  Get  the  land  foT  the  seed  ready  by  manuring,  and 
keep  digging  it ;  plant  out  the  old  Onions  for  seed  a  foot  apart  in 
clean  and  sheltered  places. 

October. — For  planting  of  the  several  kinds  of  Seed,  see 
last  month.    Parsnips  and  Celery  do  well  with  care. 

Onions. — Seed  can  be  sown  irom  about  the  25th  October  to  5th 
November. 

Cabbage. — Put  out  young  plants  of  the  early  kind. 
Peas  and  Beans. — Plant  as  last  month. 
Tomatoes. — Sow  in  beds  for  transplanting. 
Trees. — Prune  and  train  Grape  Vines,  Peach  and  other  Fruit 
Trees  ;  open  the  earth  around  the  root  and  manure  them. 

November.— Irish  Potatoes, — Get  the  land  prepared  for  plant- 
ing next  month.  It  the  land  is  ready  this  month,  dig  it  over 
lightly  the  next ;  it  will  kill  all  the  young  weeds  that  might  come 

Onions. — Get  the  seed  down  by  the  1st  if  possible  ;  covrr  the 
seed  with  new  soil,  it  will  grow  faster.  Clean  those  set  out  lor 
seed. 

Carrots. — Clean  and  thin  those  sown  and  sow  more  seed. 

Cabbage.  -Set  out  the  plants — the  early  two  feet  between  the 
rows,  one  foot  between  the  plants.  The  late  kind  three  teet  apart. 
They  grow  best  when  planted  around  the  borders  of  beds,  &c. 

Tomatoes. — If  not  sown  last  month,  sow  early  this. 

Oats. — Plant  all  spare  land  ;  also  Barley. 

December. — Irish  Potatoes. — This  is  the  season  for  putting  in 
the  Western  Reds;  commence  about  the  20th  and  continue  till  the 
1st  of  February.  Potatoes  planted  during  this  period  are  not  so 
liable  to  blight,  and  will  keep  much  longer  after  having  been  taken 
up.  Never  reap  potatoes  when  attacked  with  the  blight  until  15  or 
20  days  after  the  trees  are  dead  ;  by  this  time  all  that  remain  will 
keep,  the  bad  having  rotted.  If  guano  is  used  as  manure  put  one 
table  spoonful  between  each  set,  but  do  not  let  it  touch  the  plant, 
as  it  will  destroy  it.  It  is  best  to  use  guano  with  the  early  crop, 
so  that  it  may  obtain  much  moisture.  When  used  late  and  in  dry 
weather  it  is  likely  to  destroy  the  plant  before  the  crop  is  green. 
It  is  better  to  put  the  guano  broadcast. 

Onions  — Let  all  the  plants  be  kept  very  clean,  particularly

Treatment  of  the  Apparently  Drowned. 

The  Royal  National  Life-boat  Institution  has  issued  the  follow- 
ing directions  for  restoring  the  apparently  drowned.  The  leading 
principles  of  the  system,  and  the  practical  instructions,  are  founded 
on  those  of  the  late  Dr.  Marshall  Hall,  combined  with  those  of 
Dr.  H.  R.  Sylvester,  and  are  the  result  of  extensive  inquiries 
which  were  made  by  the  Institution  in  1863-4  amongst  medical 
men,  medical  bodies,  and  coroners,  throughout  the  United  King- 
dom. 

L 

Send  immediately  for  medical  assistance,  blankets,  and  dry 
clothing,  but  proceed  to  treat  the  patient  instantly  on  the  spot,  in 
the  open  air,  with  the  face  downwards,  whether  on  shore  or  afloat ; 
exposing  the  face,  neck,  and  chest  to  the  wind  except  in  severe 
weather,  and  removing  all  tight  clothing  from  the  neck  and  chest, 
especially  the  braces. 

The  points  to  be  aimed  at  are — first  and  immediately,  the  res- 
toration of  breathing ;  and  secondly,  after  breathing  is  restored, 
the  promotion  of  warmth  and  circulation. 

The  efforts  to  restore  breathing  must  be  commenced  imme- 
diately and  energetically,  and  persevered  in  for  one  or  two  houis, 
or  until  a  medical  man  has  pronounced  that  life  is  extinct.  Ef- 
forts to  promote  warmth  and  circulation,  beyond  removing  the 
wet  clothes  and  drying  the  skin,  must  not  be  made  until  the  first 
appearance  of  natural  breathing.  For  if  circulation  of  the  blood 
be  induced  before  breathing  has  recommenced,  the  restoration  to 
life  will  be  endangered. 

IL— TO  RESTORE  BREATHING. 

To  Clear  the  Throat. — Place  the  patient  on  the  floor  or 
ground  with  the  face  downwards,  and  one  of  the  arms  under  the 
forehead,  in  which  position  all  fluids  will  more  readily  escape  by 
the  mouth,  and  the  tongue  itself  will  fall  forward,  leaving  the  en- 
trance into  the  windpipe  free.  Assist  this  operation  by  wiping  and 
cleansing  the  mouth. 

If  satisfactory  breathing  commences,  use  the  treatment  de- 
scribed below  to  promote  warmth.  If  there  be  only  slight  breath- 
ing, or  no  breathing,  or  if  the  breathing  fail,  then — 

To  Excite  Breathing. — Turn  the  patient  well  and  instantly  on 
the  side,  supporting  the  head,  and — 

Excite  the  nostrils  with  snuff,  hartshora,  and  smelling-salts,  or 
tickle  the  throat  with  a  feather,  etc.,  if  they  are  at  hand.  Rub  the 
chest  and  face  warm,  and  dash  cold  water,  or  cold  and  hot  water, 
alternately,  on  them. 

If  there  be  no  success,  lose  not  a  moment,  but  instantly — 


74 


To  Imitate  Breathing.  —  Replace  the  patient  on  the  lace 
raising  and  supporting  the  chest  well  on  a  folded  coat  or  other 
article  of  dress. 

Turn  the  body  very  gently  on  the  side  and  a  little  beyond, 
and  then  briskly  on  the  lace,  back  again  ;  repeating  these 
measures  cautiously,  efficiently,  and  perseveringly,  about  fifteen 
times  in  the  minute,  or  once  every  four  or  five  seconds,  occasion- 
ally varying  the  side. 

[By  placing  the  patient  on  the  chest,  the  weight  of  the  body  forces 
the  air  out ;  when  turned  on  the  side,  this  pressure  is  removed,  and 
air  enters  the  chest.'] 

On  each  occasion  that  the  body  is  replaced  on  the  lace,  make 
uniform  but  efficient  pressure,  with  brisk  movement,  on  the  back 
between  and  below  the  shoulder-blades  or  bones  on  each  side, 
removing  the  pressure  immediately  before  turning  the  body  on  the 
side.  During  the  whole  of  the  operations  let  one  person  attend 
solelvto  the  movements  of  the  head,  and  of  the  arm  placed  under  it. 

[The  first  measure  increases  the  expiration,  the  second  commences 
inspiration,] 

III 

Should  those  efforts  not  prove  successful  in  the  course  of  from 
two  to  five  minutes,  proceed  to  imitate  breathing  by  Dr.  Silvester's 
method  as  follows  : — 

Place  the  patient  on  the  back  on  a  flat  surface,  inclined  a  little 
upwards  from  the  feet;  raise  and  support  the  head  and  shoulders 
on  a  small  firm  cushion  or  folded  article  of  dress  placed  under  the 
shoulder-blades. 

Draw  forward  the  patient's  tongue,  and  keep  it  projecting  be- 
yond the  lips;  an  elastic  band  over  the  tongue  and  under  the  chin 
will  answer  this  purpose,  or  a  piece  of  string  or  tape  may  be  tied 
round  them,  or  by  raising  the  lower  jaw  the  teeth  may  be  made  to 
retain  the  tongue  in  that  position.  Remove  all  tight  clothing  from 
about  the  neck  and  chest,  especially  the  braces. 

To  Imitate  the  Movements  of  Breathing. — Standing  at  the 
patient's  head,  grasp  the  arms  just  above  the  elbows,  and  draw  the 
arms  gently  and  steadily  upwards  above  the  head,  and  keep  them 
stretched  upwards  for  two  seconds  [by  this  means  air  is  drawn  into 
the  lungs.]  Then  turn  down  the  patient's  arms  and  press  them 
gently  and  firmly  for  two  seconds  against  the  sides  ol  the  chest 
[by  this  means  air  is  pressed  out  of  the  lungs]. 

Repeat  these  measures  alternately,  deliberately,  and  persever- 
ingly, about  fifteen  times  in  a  minute,  until  a  spontaneous  effort 
to  respire  is  perceived,  immediately  upon  which  cease  to  imitate 
the  movements  of  breathing,  and  proceed  to  induce  circulation  and 
warmth. 


75 


IV.— TREATMENT  AFTER  NATURAL  BREATHING  HAS 
BEEN  RESTORED. 

To  Promote  Warmth  and  CircuLxVtton — Commence  rubbing 
the  limbs  upwards,  with  firm  grasping  pressure  and  energy  using 
handkerchiefs,  flannels,  etc.,  [by  this  measure  the  blood  is  assisted 
along  the  veins  towards  the  heart.'] 

The  friction  must  be  continued  under  the  blanket  or  over  the 
dry  clothing. 

Promote  the  warmth  of  the  body  by  the  application  of  hot 
flannels,  bottles,  or  bladders  of  hot  water,  heated  bricks,  &c,  to 
the  pit  of  the  stomach,  the  arm~pits,  between  the  thighs,  and  to 
the  soles  of  the  feet. 

If  the  patient  has  been  carried  to  a  house  after  respiration  has 
been  restored*  be  careful  to  let  the  air  play  freely  about  the  room. 

On  the  restoration  of  life,  a  teaspoonful  of  warm  water  should 
be  given  ;  and  then,  if  the  power  of  swallowing  has  returned, 
small  quantities  of  wine$  warm  brandy&and=water  or  coffee, 
should  be  administered.  The  patient  should  be  kept  in  bed  and 
a  disposition  to  sleep  encouraged. 

General  Observations.— The  above  treatment  should  be 
persevered  in  for  some  hours*  as  it  is  an  erroneous  opinion  that 
persons  are  irrecoverable  because  life  does  not  soon  make  its 
appearance,  persons  having  been  restored  after  persevering  for 
many  hours* 

Appearances  which  Generally  accompany  Death.— Breath- 
ing and  the  heart's  action  cease  entirely:  the  eyelids  are  gener- 
ally half-closed  ;  the  pupils  dilated  ;  the  jaws  clenched  ;  the 
fingers  semi*contracted  ;  the  tongue  approaches  to  the  under 
edges  ot  the  lips,  and  these,  as  well  as  the  nostrils,  are  covered 
with  a  frothy  mucus.    Coldness  and  pallor  of  surface  increase. 

Cautions. — 'Prevent  unnecessary  crowding  of  persons  round 
the  body  epecially  if  in  an  apartment. 

Avoid  rough  usage,  and  do  not  allow  the  body  to  remain  on 
the  back  unless  the  tongue  is  secured* 

Under  no  circumstances  hold  the  body  up  by  the  feet, 

On  no  account  place  the  body  in  a  warm  bath,  unless  under 
medcal  direction,  and  even  then  it  should  only  be  employed  as 
a  momentary  excitant* 

The  result  of  the  operations  described  by  the  following  Cuts 
is  respiration  or  natural  breathing,  and,  if  not  too  late,  life.  Whilst 
these  operations  are  being  proceeded  with  dry  the  hands  and 
feet;  and,  as  soon  as  dry  clothing  or  blankets  can  be  procured, 
strip  the  body,  and  cover,  or  gradually  reclolhe  it,  but  take  care

For  the  Bermuda  Almanack  lor  1389. 

Gardening  in  Bermuda  might  he  made  profitable  The  dis- 
advantages under  which  the  gardener  works  are  several,  most 
of  which  can  be  removed. 

A  glance  at  the  subject  will  show  which  of  the  drawbacks 
are  natural,  and  which  are  circumstantial  or  artificial.  The  con- 
ditions of  success  are,  labor,  fertilizing  agents,  capital  or  credit, 
to  the  extent  of  a  provision  for  the  support  of  laborer  and  horse 
during  the  producing  season,  and  facilities  of  transportation  to 
market. 

The  natural  disadvantages  are,  high  winds,  droughts,  and  the 
abounding  insect  life  which  is  more  or  less  destructive  to  early 
vegetation. 

To  destroy  the  insects  and  the  seeds  of  grasses  and  weeds, 
which  would  spring  up  to  choke  the  useful  plants,  the  gardener 
cuts  away  all  vegetable  substances,  collects  and  burns  them ; 
thus  depriving  the  soil  of  the  vegetable  mould  and  fertilizing 
properties  so  necessary  to  production,  ^his  is  done  year  after 
year,  until  the  soil  becomes  quite  exhausted.    In  order  to  sup- 

j  ply  an  equivalent  for  what  is  thus  abstracted,  manures,  either 
the  ordinary  stable  compost  or  concentrated  fertilizers,  must 

j  be  applied  to  the  lands,  or  labour  becomes  unproductive  and 

j  profitless, 

j  To  meet  this  want  guano  has  been  extensively  used,  with  the 
j  same  result  as  when  a  hungry  man  takes  brandy  to  sustain  himself. 
i  The  nerves  are  lashed  into  extraordinary  exertion,  and  the 
i  failing  energies  are  revived  for  a  little  while,  only  to  leave  na- 
!  ture  still  more  exhausted  than  before. 

|      So  guano  furnishes,  by  its  amonia,  a  most  powerful  stimulant 
to  the  young  plant,  and  draws  exhaustlngly  upon  the  latent 
energies  of  the  land,  only  to  leave  the  land  poorer,  and  the 
plant  to  droop  and  languish  in  the  time  of  drought  as  it  ap- 
proaches maturity.    Guano,  depended  on  alone,  a3  a  fertilizer, 
|   is  far  worse  than  nothing,  taking  three  year3  together, 
i      Some  other  agent  must  be  found,  and  can  be  found,  cheaper,  ; 
and  incomparably  better.    The  ordinary  stable  compost  cannot 
be  procured  in  sufficient  quantities  to  meet  the  requirements ;  : 
while  many  kind3  of  manures  are  offered  for  sale,  which  are 
vile  impositions  upon  the  credulity  or  the  gardener.   There  is  I 
a  preparation  composed  of  the  refuse  of  fresh  fish  put  up  in 
plaster  of  paris,  and  barrelled  for  export  in  Boston,  which  is  j 
found  to  be  the  best  and  safest  fertilizer,  sold  at  about  half  the  j 
price  of  guano.  j 
The  natural  infertility  of  the  soil,  and  waste  from  burning 


84 


the  vegetation,  can  be  fully  remedied  by  the  use  of  the  best 
manures;  and  with  plenty  of  manure  the  most  remunerating 
crops  can  be  produced 

The  potatoes  may  fail  from  blight  occasionally ;  but  the 
onions  never  fail ;  and  the  arrowroot  never  fails  ;  and  the 
tomatoes  rarely  fail ;  while  many  other  early  vegetables  can  be 
j  profitably  cultivated,  now  that  we  have  steam  transportation 
j     What  is  most  needed — what  is  indispensable  to  the  greatest 
;  success — is  capital,  or,  its  equivalent,  credit. 
j    If  the  gardener  has  credit,  he  can  have  manures,  and  seeds*  and  \ 
|  horse  power,  and  labor,  and  food  for  daily  consumption  ;  and  ! 
'  with  these,  where  there  is  a  willingness  to  work,  there  can  scarcely 
be  a  failure.    With  these  there  might  easily  be  realized  on  gar- 
den products  for  the  Colony,  every  year,  upon  an  average,  the 
sum  of  one  hundred  thousand  pounds  sterling,  gold. 

Now  there  is  no  want  of  capital ;  we  only  require  to  make 
that  capital  available  to  the  gardener.  How  can  this  be  done  ? 
We  answer  by  a  law, 

Enact  a  law  that  shall  give  to  any  man  advancing  capital,  or 
furnishing  credit  to  the  gardener^  to  enable  him  to  produce  a 
|;  cr op,  a  specific  lien  upon  the  crop  so  produced,  in  the  hands 
!  either  of  the  producer,  purchaser,  or  shipper,  until  the  advance- 
i|  ments  of  cash,  or  credit,  shall  be  fully  covered  and  reimbursed. 
With  such  a  statute,  properly  framed  and  guarded,  without 
any  mortgage,  or  any  special  contract,  men  would  be  safe  in 
prudently  advancing  capital  to  enable  the  gardener  to  plant 
!  with  profit; 

j  Now  we  know  that  objections  may  be  raised  to  this  scheme. 
!  To  what  scheme  on  earth  may  objections  not  be  raised  ?  To 
j  use  Dr,  Samuel  Johnson's  potent  English  :  "There  are  objec- 
|  tions  to  a  vacuum,  and  objections  to  a  plenum;  but  one  or  the 
I  other  must  be  true  "  But  it  will  scarcely  be  fair  to  reject  this 
|  scheme,  unless  the  objector  can  offer  a  better  one. 

Until  something  better  can  be  devised  for  us,  brother  farmers, 
I  let  us  communicate  with  each  other,  and  diffuse  all  useful 
|  hints  in  the  way  of  improvement.  We  beg  to  offer  a  sugges* 
\  j  tion  or  two  in  closing  this  article. 

Tomatoes— Are  improved  in  size,  quality  and  quantity  by 
I  cutting  off  the  ends  of  the  longer  limbs  after  they  begin  to  bear  ; 
;  and  when  the  vine  is  of  sufficient  size,  and  in  lull  bearing, 
!l  every  new  bud,  or  branch,  or  limb  put  forth  may,  with  great 
.  advantage,  be  lopped  off    Try  it. 

Irish  Potatoe  Vines — Should  have  the  bud  cut  off  as  soon 
[j  as  they  attain  a  height  of  about  12  inches,  so  as  to  give  the 
j  j  vine  body  and  strength ;  in  this  way  the  writer  saved  a  little 


85' 


field  ftom  blight,  when  his  neighboui'3  suffered. 

Melon  Vinks — May  be  made  to  bear  nearly  double  the  ordi- 
nary quantity  by  cutting  off  the  ends  of  the  branches  after  the/ 
attain  a  length  of  about  ten  feet ;  and  afterwards  the  more  the 
branches  are  kept  lopped  off  the  better. 

In  this  climate  all  vines,  and  indeed  all  trees,  tend  to  grow 
too  much  to  leaf  and  branch  But  in  trees  and  grape  vines 
there  must  not  be  too  much  pruning,

These  Periodicals  ably  represent  the  three  great  political  par-

;  world  of  letters,  being  considered  indispensable  to  the  scholar 

;  and  the  professional  man,  while  to  the  intelligent  reader  of  every 
class  they  furnish  a  more  correct  and  satisfactory  record  of  the 

;  current  Literature  of  the  day,  throughout  the  world,  than  can 

;  be  possibly  obtained  from  any  other  source. 

The  above  Periodicals  are  reprinted  in  New  York  immedi- 
ately on  their  arrival  by  the  British  Steamers,  in  beautiful  clear
