Dual  Format  Items:  Paper  and  Microfiche 

The  following  list  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  "Annual  Selection  Update  Cycle 
1996,"  which  all  libraries  should  receive  by  May  1. 

These  titles  are  available  for  selection  by  selective  depository  libraries  in  EITHER 
paper  OR  microfiche  format.  Please  coordinate  selection  of  paper  hearings  on  a 
campus  with  two  or  more  depositories  to  avoid  duplication,  as  the  hearings  are 
expensive  to  produce  and  mail. 

REGIONALS 

Regional  libraries  have  the  option  of  choosing  a  single  format  when  dual  format  is 
offered  for  an  item  number. 

The  Library  Programs  Service  would  like  regional  libraries  to  review  the  publications 
offered  in  both  paper  and  microfiche  formats  and  submit  deselections  as  they  deem 
necessary  for  their  coilections.  CAUTION  is  urged  when  attempting  to  evaluate  the 
electronic  version  of  a  publication  against  the  paper  title  with  the  same  title  as  they 
may  not  contain  the  same  information.
