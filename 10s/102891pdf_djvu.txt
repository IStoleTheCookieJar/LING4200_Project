The  New  Government: 

MBA's  Student  Council 

Patrick  Hale 


Thank  You 

Coach  Owen! 


T ast  year  the  student  coun- 
^ cil  and  class  officers  were 
separated  to  allow  for  more 
student  leadership  and  to  al- 
low for  more  school- wide  and 
class  oppotunities. 

With  the  separation,  the 
newly  elected  officers  of  the 
student  council  believe  it  is 
going  to  make  for  a great  year. 
Secretary  Roy  Alley  said, 
“We’re  trying  toworkinafew 
more  co-ed  functions  with 
Harpeth  Hall  this  year. 

I’ve  got  lots  of  connec- 
tions over  there  — especially 
with  the  underclassmen." 


Treasurer  John  Schlansker 
also  agrees  that  the  division  of 
the  Student  Council  from  the 
class  offices,  “will  allow  us  to 
concentrate  more  on  the 
school  as  a whole  — for  there 
is  a time  for  work,  and  there  is 
also  a time  for  play." 

The  ’91 -’92  Student 
Council  seems  to  be  “a  breath 
of  fresh  air,”  says  President 
Joe  Underwood  who  sees  this 
school  year  as  a chance  for  the 
Student  Council  to  become, 
“much  more  efficient  in  its 
duties,”  and  he  requests  that 
any  student  with  a complaint 


or  an  idea  about  anything  to 
come  talk  to  him  or  another 
representative  of  the  Student 
Council. 

Underwood  sees  the  Coun- 
cil as  a coonection  between 
the  student  body  and  the  ad- 
ministration. 

Other  members  of  the  Stu- 
dent Coucil  include  Vice- 
President  P.  Hale,  Frazer 
Buntin,  Ward  Waltemath, 
Tom  Hamling,  Andy  Ward. 
Jim  Bowen,  Stephen  Ward, 
Bradley  Sloan,  and  Will 
Hickerson. 


MBA's  Corporate  Takeover 


T ast  summer,  senior 
^ Randy  Tidwell  was  a fi- 
nalist in  the  Corporate  Lead- 
ership Competition  spon- 
sored by  Junior  Achieve- 
ment. 

Randy  learned  of  the  con- 
test through  his  substitute 
economics  teacher,  Mr. 
Chapman.  Two-  thousand 
students  from  all  over  took 


Hunter  Connelly 

the  multiple  choice  test  in 
Bloomington.  IN. 

The  test  tried  to  deter- 
mined which  students  pos- 
sessed the  most  leadership 
potential.  Randy  not  only  was 
named  finalist,  but  he  also 
met  many  different  people. 

He  commented,  “It  was 
great  meeting  people  from 


around  the  world.”  Coun- 
tries represented  in  the  com- 
petition were  the  Soviet  Un- 
ion, Mexico,  The  Bahamas, 
and  Sweden.  Twenty  stu- 
dents from  Tennessee  and 
eight  from  the  Nashville  area 
competed,  representing  such 
schools  as  Whites  Creek, 
Glencliff,  Gallitin,  and 
Shelbyville.

To  honor  Coach  Tommy  Owen’s  great  contibutions  to 
Montgomery  Bell  Academy  both  on  and  off  the  football  field, 
the  administration  and  board  recently  named  the  football  sta- 
dium in  his  honor. 

Many  captains  from  past  teams  came  to  watch  their  coach  and 
mentor  receive  this  accolade.  The  Bell  Ringer , too,  would  like 
to  add  its  thanks  and  congratulations  to  Coach  Owen.

Staff  Reports 

Fifth  period  lunch 
leaves  many  people 
confused.  Time  and 
time  again  srudents 
are  forced  either  to 
wait  to  eat  or  eat 
standing  up. 

160  people  eat 
lunch  5th,  yet  the 
cafeteria  only  has 
chairs  for  1 34. 

It  just  doesn't  add 
up. 


Getting  Away  from  it  All: 
MBA's  Outing  Club 


rP  his  October  will  mark  the 
* beginning  of  another 
great  year  for  the  MBA  Out- 
ing Club.  The  Outing  Club 
traces  its  past  back  many 
years  in  MBA  history  and 
was  rejuvenated  during  the 
1990  school-year. 

The  club's  first  outing  will 
take  place  on  October  19, 
when  Mr.  Womack  and  Dr. 
Drake  take  students  on  tours 
of  historic  Civil  War  battle- 
fields. Similar  trips  to  his- 
toric sights  are  planned  for 
later  in  the  school -year. 


Andrew  Fitzgerald 

Rock  climbing  was  an  in- 
creasingly popular  activity 
among  Outing  Club  members 
in  years  past  and  will  hope- 
fully be  offered  with  a greater 
frequency  this  year. 

Basic  rock  climbing 
courses  will  be  offered  at 
Vanderbilt  University  to 
members  on  their  arrtificial 
rock  wall.  The  club  also 
hopes  to  sponsor  numerous 
trips  topopular  climbing 
sights  in  the  Nashville  area 
and  near  Chattanooga. 

Other  Outing  Club  activi- 
ties which  have  drawn  inter- 


est include  hiking,  camping, 
spelunking,  and  rafting.  The 
activities  undertaken  by  the 
club  are  limited  solely  by  the 
imaginations  of  its  members. 

The  club  will  remain  open 
to  new  ideas  at  all  times. 
While  as  many  trips  as  pos- 
sible will  be  attempted,  nu- 
merous activities  will  not  be 
possible  without  active  mem- 
ber participation. 

If  anyone  has  any  ques- 
tions or  ideas  about  possible 
projects,  please  contact  An-

J for  his  first  period  history 
class  seconds  before  the  7:50 
bell  rings.  With  a sigh  of  re- 
lief, he  pulls  his  textbook 
from  his  backpack  to  peruse 
the  reading  that  he  forgot  to  do 
last  night.  Then,  to  Joe’s  great 
dismay,  the  teacher  proceeds 
to  hand  out  a pop  quiz,  row  by 
row,  beginning  at  the  other 
end  of  the  room. 

Joe  desperately  flips 
through  the  assigned  pages 
looking  for  key  names  and 
dates  until  one  of  the  dreaded 
quizzes  arrives  on  his  desk. 
At  this  point,  he  quickly  lays 
his  textbook  on  the  floor,  in- 
advertently leaving  it  open. 
He  hopelessly  scans  the  ten 
fill-in-the-date  questions  and 
begins  to  pencil  in  wild 
guesses,  wondering  if  he’s 
even  in  the  correct  century. 
About  two  minutes  into  the 
quiz,  Joe  breaks  his  pencil  and 
reaches  into  his  bag  for  a 
sharp  one. 

In  the  process,  he  notices 
that  his  textbook  is  open  to  a 
page  showing  a timeline  that 
summarizes  last  night's  mate- 
rial. Well  aware  that  a zero  on 
this  quiz  will  bring  his  quar- 
terly average  down  to  the  fail- 
ing level  and  keep  him  on  the 
DL  for  another  four  weeks, 
Joe  quickly  decides  to  sneak  a 
few  dates  off  the  page.  “No 
big  deal,”  he  reasons.  “If  I had 
studied  last  night,  1 would 
have  known  the  answers  any- 
way.*’ 


he  feels  a bit  guilty,  but  it  isn’t 
anything  he  can’t  get  over. 
Moreover,  he  figures  it  cer- 
tainly beats  confinement  to 
after-lunch  study  hall  for  a 
whole  month.  The  teacher, 
however,  has  noticed  Joe’s 


transgres- 
sion and 
turns  the 
case  over  to 
the  Honor 
Council  that 
same  day. 

To  make  the 
story  short, 

Joe  comes 
before  the  Council,  wisely  de- 
cides to  admit  his  guilt,  and 
receives  a warning. 

Now  while  you  try  to 
guess  Joe’s  real  identity,  let 
me  tell  you  that  the  example  is 
purely  fictitious.  I made  it  up. 
The  point  is  to  warn  you  about 
that  naturally  occurring  phe- 
nomenon called  the  PANIC 
FACTOR. 

Everyone  experiences  it 
at  some  point;  some  experi- 
ence it  every  day:  it’s  that  sick 
feeling  in  your  stomach  when 
you  forget  to  study,  when  you 
don’t  know  any  of  the  an- 
swers on  the  test,  or  when  you 
realize  that  you’re  not  going 
to  make  that  good  grade  you 
really  need. 

You  will  do  anything  to 
cover  for  yourself.  Frankly, 
this  temptation  must  be  re- 
sisted. Don’t  copy  Bill’s 
English  homework,  take  a 


quick  glance  at  Fred’s  test,  or 
tell  the  office  that  you  have  a 
doctor’s  appointment  so  you 
can  go  home.  Obviously,  it 
would  be  better  never  to  put 
yourself  in  an  anxious  situ- 
ation; but  because  we  are  all 
fallible,  it  happens,  and  it’s 
important 
not  to  give 
in  to  the 
PANIC 
F A C - 
TOR. 

I em- 
phasize 
this  point 
in  particu- 


It's important  not 
to  give  in  to 
the 

PANIC  FACTOR.

lar  because  right  now  this 
point  in  the  year  seems  to  be 
the  time  when  problems  tradi- 
tionally start  to  appear.  Stu- 
dents have  gotten  into  the 
swing  of  things  and  tend  to 
relax  a little,  and  scattered  dif- 
ficulties begin  to  arise. 

As  proof,  two  cases  had 
already  been  reported  as  of 
last  week.  Another,  probably 
more  crucial  time  tends  to  be 
the  two  or  three  weeks  at  the 
end  of  each  semester,  during 
crunch  time:  the  temptation 
to  cheat  near  or  at  exam  time 
can  be  very  strong.  So  again  I 
advise  you  to  be  wary  of  the 
PANIC  FACTOR. 

That  having  been  said. 
I’d  like  to  address  what  I re- 
ally felt  to  be  a negative  pres- 
ence on  our  campus  last  year, 
especially  toward  the  end  of 
the  year:  theft.  Last  year, 
there  were  a ridiculous  num- 
ber of  cases  involving  theft. 
This  year,  I know  of  two  inci- 
dents that  have  already  oc- 
curred (there  have  probably 
been  others),  and  I fear  that 
theft  is  rearing  its  ugly  head 
once  again. 

If  there  is  an  honor  viola- 
tion that  raises  the  ire  of  the 
MBA  student  body  more  than 
others  and  that  results  in  the 
most  unhappiness  for  the 
greatest  number  of  students, 
this  has  to  be  it.  When  the 
summer  of  1992  rolls  around, 
I would  love  to  be  able  to  look 
back  on  this  school  year  as 
one  that  went  untainted  by 


theft  on  campus.  Unlike 
cheating  where  there  is  some 
gray  area  and  where  there  are 
different  standards  for  differ- 
ent classes,  stealing,  in  my 
opinion,  is  very  straightfor- 
ward: justdon’ttake  anything 
that  doesn’t  belong  to  you.  If 
we  as  a student  body  keep  this 
in  mind,  I think  we  can  have  a 
very  successful  year  in  this 
respect! 

A reminder  to  everyone 
that  the  Honor  System  is  very 
much  for  real  and  is  not  here 
to  be  mocked  or  ignored.  I’m 
often  concerned  about  the  at- 
titude that  some  students 
seem  to  carry  into  an  Honor 
Council  case  after  being 
turned  in.  In  my  opinion, 
some  boys  walk  in  the  room 
expecting  either  to  lie  their 
way  out  or  "get  away”  with  a 
“only”  a warning. 

First,  I promise  you  that 
you  cannot  lie  to  Honor  Coun- 
cil and  get  away  with  it.  When 
a student  comes  in  front  of  the 
Honor  Council,  before  he 
says  a word,  we  will  remind 
him  that  lying  to  the  Honor 
Council  is  an  offense  in  and  of 
itself. 

If  that  student  lies  any- 
way, he  forces  us  to  give  him 
the  next  more  serious  punish- 
ment at  least.  Second,  I con- 
sider it  a 
terrible 
mistake  to 
interpret  an 
Honor 
Council 
warning  as 
a slap  on 


The  honor  system 
is  very  much  for 
real  and  not  here 
to  be  mocked. 


everyone  has  already  been 
warned,  but  the  warning  re- 
mains as  a safety  device  to 
give  students  the  benefit  of 
the  doubt.  In  sum,  should  you 
make  a mistake  and  come 
before  the  Honor  Council, 
instead  of  mocking  the  situ- 
ation or  lying,  use  it  as  an 
opportunity  to  make  yourself 
better. 

The  intent  here  is  not  to 
frighten  anybody,  especially 
you  younger  guys.  The 
Honor  Council  is  here  to  help. 
You  don’t  need  to  go  to  ex- 
tremes: We  don’t  want  you  to 
worry  about  asking  Neil  how 
to  get  started  on  a math  prob- 
lem. (We  don’t  want  you  to 
copy  Neil’s  work,  though.) 

Peers  are  an  impor- 
tant resource,  just  don’t  abuse 
that  resource.  There  is  no 
need  to  go  through  MBA  in 
perpetual  fear  of  the  Honor 
Council,  just  give  it  the  re- 
spect it  deserves. 

Remember  that  95%  of 
the  student  body  never  comes 
before  the  Honor  Council.  If 
you  work  for  the  Honor  Sys- 
tem, it  will  work  for  you. 

When  you  come  down  to 
it,  the  students  will  make  it  or 
break  it.  Additionally,  as 
there  will  be  some  elections 
coming  up  soon,  I would  like 
to  stress  to 
the  8th  and 
9th  graders 
the  impor- 
tance of  se- 
lecting re- 
sponsible 
Honor 


the  wrist.  Though  it  has  no 
dire  consequences,  the  warn- 
ing is  still  a punishment.  The 
intention  is  to  correct  prob- 
lems now  at  this  level  without 
leaving  a brand  on  a student 
for  the  rest  of  his  life,  a very 
real  possibility  if  such  a prob- 
lem is  allowed  to  continue  on 
down  the  road.  By  no  means 
the  end  of  the  world,  a warn- 
ing is  the  Honor  Council’s 
method  of  stopping  dishonest 
habits  before  they  get  worse. 

The  warning  is  in  a sense 
a misnomer.  In  actuality. 


Council  representatives. 
Elect  someone  whom  you 
know  to  be  honest  and  fair. 

I think  that  the  election  of 
Honor  Council  representa- 
tives is  different  from  that  of 
Student  Council  representa- 
tives or  class  officers  in  that 
you’re  not  necessarily  look- 
ing for  a student  who  can  re- 
late to  and  stay  in  tune  with 
the  immediate  interests  of  his 
classmates,  you’re  looking 
for  a student  who  can  relate 
well  to  a strong  sense  of 
honor . 


From  a friend- 

Congratulations  Mrs.  Palmore 

for  an  award  well-deserved!

OPINIONS 


Wettere  to  the  lEbtior 


Dear  MBA, 

Last  issue,  I made  a call 
for  people  to  write  letters  to 
the  editor.  Several  of  you 
did.  However,  perhaps  if  I 
explain  what  exactly  can  be 
done  with  this  section,  more 
people  will  contribute. 

If  you  find  an  article,  com- 
ment, another  letter,  or  any- 
thing at  all  a bit  objection- 
able. you  can  write  a brief 
statement  to  the  paper  attack- 
ing, criticizing,  or  reaffirm- 
ing something  printed. 

This  section  is  the  student 
body's  area  for  free  com- 
ment. Because  letters  can  be 
short  or  shortened  by  the 
editors,  many  can  be  printed. 
Additionally,  they  take  very 
little  effort  or  time  to  write. 

The  letters  in  this  issue 
are  unusually  long.  I encour- 
age everyone  to  consider 


writing  a letter  to  the  paper. 

Letters  to  the  editor  is  not 
just  a section  for  the  students. 
If  any  faculty  member  would 
like  to  comment  about  the 
paper,  please  write  in. 

I beleive  that  it  will  make 
a much  more  interesting  pa- 
per if  opinions  from  all  mem- 
bers of  the  MBA  community 
are  expressed.  Faculty  mem- 
bers please  feel  free  to  write 
to  the  paper. 

Finally,  I would  also  like 
to  mention  that  the  paper  has 
received  no  classifieds.  As 
attested  to  by  the  numerous 
advertisements  in  the  paper. 
The  Bell  Ringer  is  a wonder- 
ful place  to  announce  that  you 
have  something  to  sell  or  are 
looking  for  something  to  buy.

Political  Organizations  on 
MBA'sCampus 

Dear  Bell  Ringer , 


We  minors  here  in  America 
have  lived  our  lives  under  the 
burden  of  our  parents'  society, 
and  soon  we  will  be  expected 
to  take  the  reins  from  the 
“baby  boomers.” 

I would  like  to  respond  to 
Andrew  Fitzgerald’s  article 
concerning  the  political 
awareness  or  lack  thereof  in 
MBA  students.  While  I con- 
cur with  Mr.  Fitzgerald  that 
MBA  students  should  be  con- 
scious of  the  social  and  politi- 
cal welfare  of  the  state,  1 must 
state  that  for  fairness's  sake, 
school-sponsored  political 
events  should  not  be  at- 
tempted. 

Firstly,  not  every  MBA 
student  shares  the  views  of  the 
Republican  Party.  1,  for  one, 
disagree  with  several  of  their 
tenets  as  do  several  other 


people  on  campus.  If  a Re- 
publican group  were  to 
emerge  on  campus,  other  po- 
litical groups  would  appear 
and  perhaps  disrupt  the  conti- 
nuity of  the  school. 

Second.  I have  always  pic- 
tured the  school  as  apolitical, 
a place  where  one's  particular 
social,  political,  and  religious 
views  are,  for  the  most  part, 
accepted  by  all.  I do  not  wish 
to  endanger  this  attitude. 

On  the  other  hand,  politi- 
cal and  social  envolvement  is 
imperative  for  adolescents, 
and  there  I agree  with  Mr. 
Fitzgerald. 

I would  also  like  to  point 
out  the  variety  of  social  action 
organizations  available  at 
MBA:  the  Soup  Kitchen,  the 
Boys’  Club  tutoring  program, 
the  Recycle  MBA  organiza- 


tion, the  Service  Club,  and 
others. 

These  organizations  pro- 
vide an  outlet  for  students  to 
contribute  their  skills  and 
help  ameliorate  some  of  the 
social  traumas  of  our  city. 
Any  student  may  take  advan- 
tage of  these  programs.  Fur- 
thermore, political  organiza- 
tions are  useful  for  develop- 
ing a sense  of  knowledge  and 
belief  in  the  government,  and 
indeed  I support  these  groups, 
but  they  need  not  be  school- 
sponsored  or  school-con- 
trolled by  any  means  lest  the 
school  tear  itself  asunder. 

Sincerely. 

Andrew  Vahrenkamp 


Crappie  Complaint 


Dear  Bell  Ringer, 

With  the  start  of  a new  year, 
many  fresh  and  creative  ideas 
should  be  proposed  by  ingen- 
ious MBA  students.  A great 
way  to  profess  one’s  ideas  and 
creativity  is  through  the  Bell 
Ringer. 

This  year,  a plethora  of 
students  may  be  deprived  of 
this  privilege  due  to  the  inter- 
est of  a small  percent  of  the 
faculty  and  student  body.  For 
example,  the  "Crappy  Cor- 
ner," written  by  Malcolm 
Sewell  and  Hunter  Connelly, 
appears  to  have  had  its  con- 
tinuation into  the  new  school 
year  denied. 

For  those  of  you  unaware, 
the  "Crappy  Comer"  was  an 
article  aiding  fellow  fisher- 
men in  a funny  southern  dia- 
lect with  tips  on  the  hot  spots 
where  one  can  pull  in  those 
big  fish. 

Of  course,  the  faculty  and 
some  students  will  find  this 
information  useless,  but  what 
right  does  this  percentile  have 


to  dominate  a newspaper  or- 
ganized by  the  students  at  a 
high  school  level? 

Furthermore,  I personally 
have  spoken  with  teachers 
who  really  enjoyed  the 
"Crappy  Comer."  All  in  all.  1 
believe  the  students  should 
not  allow  a certain  unit  of  the 
school  to  make  its  own 


changes  without  the  support

A Conservative  Rebuke  Political  Correctness? 


Bchdad  Shahsavari 


Garrett  Kyle 


A fi  r.  Bush  stepped  into 

office  on  a platform  of 
great  programs  and  promises 
which  won  him  the  title  of  the 
most  popular  president  ever. 
Despite  the  enormous  popu- 
larity President  Bush  holds 
with  the  public,  his  domestic 
agenda  seems  sorely  lacking 
from  an  objective  viewpoint. 

Some  would  argue  that  his 
foreign  policy,  as  well,  is  not 
as  beneficial  as  he  pretends. 

For  a president  who  claims 
to  be  "the  Education  Presi- 
dent," Bush's  recent  veto  of 
the  Democtats*  bill  to  educa- 
tion funding  seems  quite 
hypocritical. 

Additionally,  Bush  has  an 
education  stance  of  his  own, 
making  yet  another  set  of 
campaign  promises  seem 
empty  indeed. 

Mr.  Bush  also  recently 
vetoed  an  employment  bill 
which  would  have  created 
more  government  jobs  and 
dccrcsed  much  bureaucratic 
waste.  His  argument  was  that 
he  didn't  want  to  spend  the 
money.  Surely  the  gain  in 
jobs  and  increased  efficiency 
would  be  worth  the  money; 
yet  with  election  time  on  the 
way,  Mr.  Bush  feels  it  is 
unwise  to  spend  money  on 
new  programs. 

And  what  of  the  recent 
Civil  Rights  bill  which  again 
met  Presidential  wrath  in 
Congress?  Bush  complained 


of  quotas  and  irregular  meth- 
ods of  regulation  in  the  bill, 
but  why  could  he  not  amend  it 
with  his  own  fair  policies? 
Certainly  he  has  something 
better  than  the  disparities  ex- 
isting now. 

And  now  to  “no  new 
taxes"  as  a motto.  It  has  to  be 
hard  to  stick  to  that  policy 
platform  when  one  of  two 
ways  to  fund  new  programs  is 
taxation.  It  seems  that  Mr. 
Bush  doesn’t  get  the  blame 
for  this,  however,  or  any  of  the 
other  contradictions  in  his 
governmental  policies. 

Mr.  Bush  always  has  Con- 
gress to  blame,  or  inadequa- 
cies in  the  legislation  itself. 
Where,  one  might  ask,  are  his 
own  proposals  to  solve  these 
problems?  Where  are  the 
lower  taxes  and  better  educa- 
tion promised  to  his  voters. 

Even  internationally,  Mr. 
Bush  has  gotten  away  with 
supposedly  tough  stance 
which  benefits  the  U.S.,  de- 
spite the  fact  that  they  are 
directly  contradicting  his 
promises  of  old. 

Israeli  loans  for  property 
were  wiped  out  by  Bush,  who 
promised  them  earlier  and 
now  justifies  his  withdrawal 
because  of  Israeli-Palestinian 
tensions. 

Most  Favored  Nation  trade 
staus  with  China,  too.  has 
been  put  off  by  President 
Bush.  A plan  in  the  works  for 
months  which  promises  to 


benefit  both  our  economies 
and  ease  tensions  has  bee 
shifted  to  the  back  burner  by 
Bush  at  election  time. 

It  seems  to  me  that  Mr. 
Bush  promises  major,  popu- 
lar measures  and  pulls  for 
them  with  a tough  stance, 
until  the  potential  for  respon- 
sibility arises.  When  impor- 
tant measures  come  to  final 
legislation,  that  is  when  Mr. 
Bush  finds  an  excuse  to  re- 
nege or  leave  some  minor  for- 
mality unfulfilled. 

Perhaps  the  budget  is  im- 
portant and  the  Israeli-Pales- 
tinian peace  talks  have 
slowed,  but  but  these  minor 
issues  are  overshadowed  by 
the  big  hype  measures  our 
President  promised. 

It  is  too  easy  for  him  to 
pretend  to  have  a hardline 
stance  when  in  reality  he  is 
backing  down  on  a bill;  it  is 
too  easy  to  evade  personal 
responsibility  for  potentially 
controversial  or  experimental 
issues  by  cutting  bureaucratic 
budgets. 

But  it  is  simply  too  close  to 
election  time  for  a popularity 
check  or  a potentially  failed 
program.  So  for  Bush's 
reelection,  we  the  voters  are 
stuck  with  another  term  with- 
out education  reform.  Civil 
Rights  corrections,  strong 
foreign  policy  actions,  or  em- 
ployment measures. 


A lthough  the  term  "politi- 
cal  correctness"  has  ap- 
peared with  increasing  fre- 
quency in  newspapers  and 
magazines  over  the  past 
couple  of  years,  the  move- 
ment itself  has  hardly  re- 
ceived the  attention  it  de- 
serves from  the  general  public 
and  even  from  those  directly 
involved  in  education.  It  is  a 
movement  that  threatens  to 
destroy  completely 

America’s  colleges  and  uni- 
versities and  to  corrupt  an 
entire  generation  of  students. 

Society  has  always  looked 
to  its  institutions  of  higher 
learning  for  intellectual  lead- 
ership and  for  the  shaping  of 
responsible,  thoughtful  citi- 
zens. 

When  these  institutions 
prefer  fashionable  nonsense 
to  truth  and  emotion  to  ration- 
ality, as  proponents  of  the 
movement  would  have  them 
do,  society  is  in  grave  danger. 

The  basic  problem  has 
been  described  as  a "tyranny 
of  the  minority.”  Various 
minority  political  groups 
have  demanded  that  the  num- 
ber of  admitted  students  of 
one  of  the  recognized  minori- 
ties be  proportional  to  the 
minority’s  percentage  in  the 
population. 

Thus,  race,  rather  than 
merit,  becomes  the  governing 
factor  in  the  admissions  proc- 
ess and  many  unqualified  stu- 
dents are  admitted. 

Schools  that  have 
adopted  this  plan  brag  about 
the  figures  showing  this  “cor- 
rect" proportionality,  but 


remain  very  quiet  about  fig- 
ures revealing  the  alarmingly 
large  number  of  these  stu- 
dents who  drop  out  because 
they  simply  cannot  compete 
with  better  prepared  students. 
Figures  also  show  that  the 
most  “correct”  schools  are  the 
ones  with  the  most  racial  inci- 
dents. 

These  same  minority 
groups  have  also  demanded 
that  universities  abandon  the 
traditional  curriculum  based 
on  Western  civilization  be- 
cause, they  argue,  its  white 
progenitors,  the  Greeks  and 
the  Romans,  were  racist. 

The  fact  is,  however,  that 
this  curriculum  is  taught  not 
because  it  is  "white”  but  be- 
cause Western  civilization 
was  based  on  capitalism,  de- 
mocracy, and  the  superiority 
of  the  individual,  all  concepts 
that  are  alien  to  most  Eastern 
civilizations. 

Certainly  there  are  works 
from  other  cultures  worthy  of 
inclusion,  but  for  the  most 
part,  works  selected  by  “cor- 
rect" schools  are  Westernized 
or  appeal  to  the  sympathies  of 
the  victimized  minorities. 
The  pursuit  of  Truth  becomes 
secondary  to  pleasing  politi- 
cally powerful  minority 
groups. 

The  politically  correct, 
while  proclaiming  them- 
selves the  defenders  of  mi- 
norities, have  actually  hurt 
them  by  destroying  admis- 
sions standards  based  on 
merit  and  by  undermining 
academic  standards.  America 
must  act  now  to  save  its  fu- 
ture.

With  Extreme  Prejudice 


The  Nature  of 
Generalizations 


John  Wesley 
Copy  Editor 


rp  he  other  day,  1 heard  a 
fellow  student  pro- 
nounce a religious  epithet; 
when  challenged,  this  student 
replied  that  it  was  his  first 
amendment  right  to  say  what- 
ever he  pleased. 

Utilizing  the  first  amend- 
ment to  justify  an  unthinking, 
insensitive,  prejudicial  re- 
mark makes  a travesty  of 
every  right 
which  this 
amendment  up- 
holds, espe- 
cially in  an  in- 
stitution whose 
goals  are  to  nur- 
ture gentlemen  and  scholars. 

Decrying  a person  on 
grounds  such  as  race  or  reli- 
gion is  neither  the  act  of  a gen- 
tleman nor  a scholar.  As  stu- 
dents at  MBA,  we  have  a re- 
sponsibility to  maintain  a tra- 
dition of  honor.  Though  not 
within  the  purview  of  the 
school’s  honor  code,  prejudi- 
cial statements  should  fall 
within  each  student’s  per- 
sonal code  of  honor. 

True  honor  comes  not 


To  quote  Jim  Morrison, 
“labels  are  shortcuts  to 
thinking.”  This  statement 
applies  to  racism.  Racism  is  a 
trend  that  eliminates  all  indi- 
viduality. When  racism  oc- 
curs, assumptions  are  made 
about  people  and  their  charac- 
teristics based  upon  a label. 
We  eliminate  the  rational 
thought  process  that  is  sup- 
posed to  be  the  human’s 
means  to  survive. 

Racism  also  gives  people 
of  one  race  an  automatic  self- 
esteem based  on  their  affili- 
ation with  an  allegedly  supe- 
rior race.  As  Ayn  Rand  says, 
“The  overwhelming  majority 
of  racists  are  men  who  have 
earned  no  sense  of  personal 
identity,  who  can  claim  no 
individual  achievement  or 
self-distinction,  and  who  seek 
the  illusion  of  a ‘tribal  self- 
esteem’  by  alleging  the  inferi- 
ority of  some  other  tribe.” 
This  is  not  a characteristic  of 
men  of  intellect  or  accom-

from  winning  the  game  or 
scoring  well  on  a test,  but  in 
dealings  with  fellow  men.  If 
we,  not  only  as  students  of 
MBA,  but  also  as  members  of 
the  larger  community,  con- 
tinue to  judge  others  on  crite- 
ria reflecting  artificial  dis- 
tinctions, then  individuality 
vanishes. 

Without  the  differences 
that  make  up 
each  person  and 
each  culture, 
MBA  would  be 
stagnant  and 
boring.  All 
people  bring  a 
unique  perspective  to  how 
life  is  lived;  by  mocking  those 
of  different  religions  or  races, 
the  perpetrator  demonstrates 
an  unwillingness  to  go  be- 
yond a limited  scope  of  expe- 
rience. 

Simply  by  being  high 
school  students,  we  admit  a 
desire  to  learn.  Learning  is  a 
process  of  expanding  hori- 
zons and  exploring  new  vis- 
tas. By  accepting  and  wel- 
coming cultural  differences, 
MBA's  student  body  stands 


plishment.  Racism  is  the 
primitive,  irrational  shortcut. 

The  view  of  race  is  one 
that  needs  to  see  a change  in 
its  place  in  American  culture. 
Despite  the  evil  that  exists  in 
racism,  this  change  must  be 
one  of  individual  choice.  The 
state  of  man  and  the  state  of 
racism  is  not  bettered  by 
forced  action.  A man  forced 
to  be  non-discriminatory  is 
merely  an  oppressed  racist. 
Even  this,  however,  is  not  the 
issue.  The  problem  that  must 
be  recognized  is  that  any  at- 
tempt to  ameliorate  racism 
within  policy  action  is  in  itself 
racist. 

The  policy  of  racial  quotas 
is  one  that  affects  our  entire 
population  in  the  form  of  job 
quotas  and  college  admission 
quotas.  Though  they  are  util- 
ized to  eliminate  racism,  these 
policies  merely  institutional- 
ize, intensify,  and  guarantee 
racism.  Quotas  in  the  United 
States  group  Afro-Americans 


much  to  gain  and  nothing  to 
lose,  for  with  diversity  comes 
vitality. 

To  take  advantage  of  the 
possibilities,  there  is  but  one 
requirement  - an  open  mind. 
If  MBA  can  foster  an  image  of 
openmindedness,  then  per- 
haps more  of  those  of  differ- 
ent backgrounds  will  seek  out 
the  exceptional  opportunities 
at  MBA;  however,  it  is  the  re- 
sponsibility of  the  student 
body  to  at  least  create  an  envi- 
ronment in  which  diversity 
will  thrive  and  be  welcomed. 

If  we  remain  silent  and 
allow  a vocal  minority  to 
present  a view  of  an  uncaring 
MBA,  then  the  students  who 
are  the  true  gentlemen  and 
scholars  are  being  denied 
their  rightful  due  - an  hetero- 
geneous environment. 

1 therefore  implore  every- 
one at  school  to  think  about 
what  is  said,  for  with  one 
uncaring  word,  a person  not 
only  denies  himself  honor, 
but  a wealth  of  possibility  as 
well. 


into  a collective  in  the  same 
way  that  racist  policies 
against  them  do.  The  evil  is 
still  present;  it  merely  works 
to  the  advantage  of  a different 
group.  Quotas  are  a form  of 
collective  punishment.  They 
punish  one  collective,  in  this 
case  Caucasians,  for  the  sins 
of  their  ancestors;  hence,  they 
remove  individual  character- 
istics and  replace  them  with 
color. 

Racism  is  evil,  and  it  is  a 
plague  that  humans  must 
overcome.  It  represents  col- 
lectivist shortcuts  to  thinking, 
and  elimination  of  individual 
rights.  When  we  try  to  rectify 
problems  caused  by  racism 
through  collectivist  racism 
itself,  however,  the  cause  is 
forfeited.  It  is  a prime  ex- 
ample of  two  immoral  actions 
not  substantiating  one  virtu- 
ous one.  Racism  is  a blinding 
force  that  abandons  our  facul- 
ties of  reason,  and  leads  us 
into  darkness. 


T have  been  personally 

offended  by  a comment 
made  in  assembly. 

Although  the  speaker  did 
not  aim  his  remark  at  me.  the 
significance  of  his  statement, 
as  well  as  its  reception  by  the 
audience,  troubled  me. 

The  boy  at  the  podium 
was  talking  about  a coming 
athletic  con- 
test against  a 
local  school. 

After  encour- 
aging the  stu- 
dent body  to 
give  their  support  to  the  team, 
he  proceeded  to  draw  a gross 
and  deleterious  generaliza- 
tion about  the  type  of  student 
that  attended  the  other  school. 

The  boy  most  likely  did 
not  mean  to  cause  any  dam- 
age. but  being  unprepared  to 
speak,  he  tried  to  be  humor- 
ous and  lost  control  of  his 
words. 

Not  all  jokes  are  bad,  and 
many  times  this  boy  has  been 
entertaining  at  the  podium. 
But  as 
Seneca 
pointed 
out,  “It  is 
no  joke  to 
be  mali- 
cious; never  are  jokes  pleas- 
ing which  cause  harm.” 

The  first  victim  of  this 
comment  is  the  student  body 
of  the  other  school.  All  the 
efforts,  all  the  achievements, 
and  all  the  personal  qualities 
of  those  students  are  negated 
by  sneering  cynicism.  Each 
student  of  that  institution 
loses  his  personal  integrity 
and  individual  identity  and  is 
considered  a worthless  fail- 
ure. 

Addi- 
tionally, 
subtle  and 
unchal- 
lenged bi- 
ases and 
preconceptions  may  slip  into 
the  minds  of  the  audience 
under  the  guise  of  a “joke." 
The  original  generalization 
then  makes  the  audience  into 
generalists,  and  they,  in  turn, 
spread  their  own  half-truths  to 
others. 


The  second  victim  is  our 
own  school.  By  characteriz- 
ing others  as  bad.  we  are 
imply  that  we  are  better  than 
they. 

What  would  have  hap- 
pened if  a member  of  the  press 
or  a visitor  from  the  commu- 
nity had  been  visiting  our 
school  that  day?  We  would  be 
characterized  as 
callous,  without 
any  respect  for 
others.  Each 
member  of  the 
student  body 
would  suffer  the  same  conse- 
quence as  the  other  school's 
students:  we  would  lose  our 
own  personal  worth  in  the 
eyes  of  others;  we  would  be 
judged  not  by  who  we  are  and 
what  we  do,  but  rather  by 
where  we  go  to  school.  MBA 
is  a highly  visible  leader  in  the 
midstate  community;  in  aca- 
demics, in  sports,  and  in  citi- 
zenship, our  students  consis- 
tently strive  to  do  their  best. 
We  must,  therefore,  continue 
to  preserve 
and  to  prove 
our  merit. 

Most 
ironically, 
the  greatest 
victim  is  the  speaker,  himself. 
He  does  not  intend  to  be  inju- 
rious. but  because  of  his  lack 
of  preparation,  he  character- 
izes himself,  in  the  eyes  of  the 
audience,  as  unintelligent, 
unrestrained,  and  hypocriti- 
cal, with  an  unreal  perception 
of  the  world. 

Any  public  speaker  has  a 
tremendous  power  to  affect 
others  and.  consequently,  a 
tremendous  responsibility. 

The  speaker  is 
accountable  for 
what  he  says; 
for,  as  Horace 
indicates, 
“You  can  erase 
that  which  has 
not  yet  been  said,  but  the 
voice  once  spoken  can  never 
be  recalled.” 

Let  us,  therefore,  be  re- 
sponsible in  the  manner  that 
we  bear  ourselves  and  treat 
others. 


True  honor  comes  not 
from  winning  the  game 
or  scoring  well  on  a test, 
but  in  dealings  with  fel- 
low men.

rP  his  year,  the  eighth  grade 
^ has  a new  teacher  named 
Mr.  Demong.  His  unique 
style  of  teaching  English  has 
the  eighth  grade  baffled.  Mr. 
Demong.  however,  is  simply 
trying  to  teach  us  how  to 
think.” 

After  Mrs.  Brewer’s  dia- 
gramming courses  last  year, 
Mr.  Demong  uses  a whole 
new  approach  to  teaching 
English.”  says  Zach  Smith. 
Most  of  Demong ’s  students 
feel  this  way.  “We  do  diagram 
sentences,  but  in  a way  only 
seen  by  Mr.  Demong ’s  board- 
ing school  class  in 
Hudson.Ohio,"  says  Brooks 
Hoffstetter. 

Though  peculiar,  Mr. 
Demong’s  methods  have 
been  helpful.  Like  Mr.  De- 
mong, the  eighth  grade  is  ad- 
justing well  to  the  new  year. 
Latin  is  the  only  new  subject 
this  year.Even  though  we

shows  no  signs  of  a sell-out. 
In  fact  the  album  traces  its 
roots  back  to  the  anti -com- 


mercial days  of  their  self- 
titled  debut  and  Freaky  Sty- 
ley.  Lyrically.  Blood  Sugar 
Se.v  Magik  rises  above  any 
previous  works  by  the  band. 
Moving  from  the  envi- 
ronmental aware- 
ness of  “The 
Righteous  and 
the  Wicked” 
to  the  aliena- 
tion of  “Un- 
der The 
Bridge”,  this 
album  encom- 
passes many 
powerful  lines. 
The  main  theme  of  the 
album,  however,  is  , of 
course,  sex.  The  sexual  innu- 
endos of  “Give  It  Away”  and 
the  blatant  crudeness  of  “Sir 
Psycho”  pretty  much  sum  up 
the  Chili  Peppers’  world 
view. 

After  the  release  of 


Double  Impact 

Sonny  Heiser 


T t’s  been  two  years  since  the 

Red  Hot  Chili  Peppers 
stormed  across  the  music 
scene  with  their  ultra  funky 
Mother's  Milk  album.  Since 
then  the  Chili  Peppers  have 
indulged  in  such  illustrious 
activities  as  getting  arrested, 
performing  on  Club 
M.T.V.!?!,  and  doing  a com- 
mercial with  Andre  Agassi. 

This  past  summer  the  Chili 
Peppers  teamed  up  with  Rick 
Ruben  of  Cult  fame  to  create 
yet  another  relentlessly  funky 
album.  The  result  is  Blood 
Sugar  Sex  Magik-  a combina- 
tion of  old  style  Chili  Pepper 
funk  mixed  with  the  modem 
influential  aspects  of  bands 
like  Jane’s  Addiction. 

The  album  opens  with 
“The  Power  Of  Equality”,  an 
assault  on  upper  class  white 
supremacy.  The  disco  funk  of 
"If  You  Have  To  Ask”  re- 


T recently  saw  Double 
A Impact . the  latest  in- 
stallment in  the  Jean  Claude 
Van  Damme  movie  collec- 
tion. While  going  into  the 
theater,  my  companion,  not 
the  Van  Damme  aficionado 
that  I am  attacked  Claude's 
manliness  with  such  com- 
ments as.  “He's  only  5’  10,” 
“Arnold  could  rip  him  in 
two,”  and  the  very  foolish  “1 


could  take  him  anyday." 

Sure  you  could.  While  it’s 
true  his  fights  are  choreo- 
graphed and  not  very  many 
blows  actually  connect,  one 
only  has  to  see  a movie  or 
two  of  his  to  begin  to  stop 
the  innane  comments. 

The  latest  movie. 
Double  Impact,  involves 
twins  separated  a few  months 
after  birth  and  then  reunited 


twenty-four  years  later  to 
avenge  their  father’s  death  at 
the  hands  of  a Japanese  mob- 
ster/businessman. 

While  the  plot  is 
slightly  unbelievable,  one 
must  remember  that  the  plot 
isn’t  the  reason  for  Van 
Damme’s  movie  success. 
One  watches  a Van  Damme 
movie  to  “learn ’em  good.” 

Nevertheless,  since 
Van  Damme  plays  both  he- 
roes, the  unique  photography 
should  be  applauded. 

The  only  problem  1 
found  with  the  movie  is  Van 
Damme  *s  use  of  a gun,  which 
triples  the  usual  death  rate  of

Y \T  clcome  to  the  first 
’ ’ column  in  The  Bell 
Ringer  about  country  music. 
Country  music,  in  my 
opinion,  is  the  best  music 
around  right  now.  The 
mood  is  set  by  the  lyrics  and 
the  music. 

Country  music  is  about 
real  life  and  real  people.. 

The  songs  deal  with  many 
facets  of  life.  That  is  why  I 
along  with  many  other 
people  enjoy  country  music. 

The  second  week  of  Octo- 
ber was  CMA  week,  high- 
lighted by  the  CMA  awards  at 
the  Grand  Ole  Opry.  Reba 
Macentire  hosted  the  show 
which  included  performances 
by  Reba  herself,  Travis  Tritt. 
Vince  Gill  and  the  Patty 
Loveless  duo,  and  Alan 
Jackson. 

Garth  Brooks  put  all  of  his 
heart  into  the  song  "Shame- 
less” written  by  Billy  Joel 
which  he  performed  at  the 
show.  Brooks  won  most  of 
the  awards  (4)  including  En- 
tertainer of  the  Year.  Travis 
Tritt  walked  away  with  the 
Horizon  Award  given  to  the 
best  new  artist  of  the  year. 
Vince  Gill  stunned  many 
people  by  beating  Garth 
Brooks  in  the  category  for 
Best  Male  Vocalist.  The 
CMA  awards  were  honored 
by  the  presence  of  President 
and  Mrs.  Bush  at  the  show. 
Country  music  is  better  than 
ever  with  a new  freshness  and 
excitement.

The  Golden  Youth  of  Madison  Lott : 
Movie  with  Meaning 

Robert  Howell 


T^espite  the  seeming  failure 
■^of  the  movie  industry  to 
release  any  films  of  note  in  re- 
cent years,  there  still  can  be 
found  token  gold  mines 
among  the  reel  wasteland. 
The  Golden  Youth  of  Madison 
Lott  is  evidence  of  such  re- 
maining greatness.  Directed 
by  the  up  and  coming  talent, 
Charles  Thompson,  the 
movie  reveals  a plot  of  sub- 
stance, a brilliant  score  of 
music  by  Trent  Reznor,  and 
an  underlying  philosophy  that 
combines  the  nihilism  of 
Nietzsche,  the  brilliance  of 
Aristotle,  and  even  the  episte- 
mological views  of  Wittgen- 
stein 

Set  in  New  York  City,  the 
film  is  predictably  crowded 
with  action;  however,  not  in 
the  usual  sense.  For  one  thing, 
the  scenery  mutates  through- 
out the  movie,  changing  from 
the  Big  Apple,  to  a rural  Wis- 
consin town,  to  Athens. 
Greece  and  then  back  again  to 
New  York.  Such  cinematog- 
raphy and  special  effects  is 
unprecedented.  Along  with 
the  scenery,  the  characters 
slowly  change  to  make  it 
seem  as  if  three  movies  are 
being  watched  at  once. 

The  action  is  started  as 
the  young  Madison  views  a 
murder  from  his  rhubarb 
stand.  Vaulting  over  the 


counter,  he  begins  his 
pursuit  of  the  murderer. 

This  begins  his  stint  of 
crime- 
fight- 
ing. 

The 
next 
phase 
of  his 
life 
which 
we 

view,  is 
his  life 
on  a 
sailboat 
on  the 
Medi- 
terra- 
nean. 

He 

spends 
his 

time  as 
an  he- 
donistic 
play- 
boy, 
flipping 
in  and 
out  of 
ro- 
mance. 

Despite 
his 

crime-fighting  past,  his  inner 
corruption  is  viewed. 

During  the  middle  ten 
minutes  of  this  three  hour 


explosion,  scenes  of  ninjas 
who  glow  in  the  dark 
prevail.  Instead  of  their  nor- 


an idea  of  the  depth  of  the 
film,  it  is  necessary  that 
lines  be  quoted.  A prime  ex- 
ample 


when 
Abu 
the 
Whip 
Master 
ex- 
claims 
the  dif- 
ference 
be- 
tween 


mal  grunts  and  groans,  they 
exclaim  important  phrases 
and  aphorisms  to  demon- 
strate that  the  pen  really  is 
mightier  than  the  sword. 

In  order  to  give  anyone 


when 
he 

shouts, 
“Mah 
bruther 
wonts 
to  faht 
chew- 
www”. 
A fa- 
vorite 

character,  and  a friend  of 
Madison’s  is  Jobu  Tanali, 
who  has  a theory  of  psychol- 
ogy based  upon  staring  at  in- 
dividuals and  asking  “What 


do  you  think  of  elephants?” 
When  people  didn’t  respond, 
he  would  shout  “What  is  the 
matter  with  elephants!!!” 
Based  on  their  response,  he 
would  psycho-analyze  them. 
The  final  character  of  impor- 
tance is  Mustapha  the  wine 
merchant  who  was  a poetic 
terrorist.  His  favorite 
slogans  are  “young  children 
have  beautiful  feet”,  “gay  Zi- 
onism”, and  "bleeding  head 
good,  healed  head  bad”.  His 
favorite  activity  of  demon- 
strating ontological  anarchy 
is  entering  citibank  com- 
puter customer  service  areas 
during  their  busy  periods, 
defecating  upon  the  floor, 
and  then  leaving. 

Despite  all  of  the  obvious 
vulgarities  that  exist  in  the 
film,  the  message  conveyed  is 
very  real:  that  society  is  a 
lawnmower.  and  individuals 
are  merely  weeds  in  its  path. 
This  movie  is  not  advertised 
for  a reason.  It  is  not  for  ev- 
eryone, but  if  mine  and  other 
critics’  predictions  are  cor- 
rect, in  twenty  years,  it  will  be 
referred  to  as  the  Nostrada- 
mus of  our  time.  1 would  sug- 
gest that  anyone  with  ques- 
tions about  life  view  this 
movie,  and  in  the  words  of 
Madison  “let’s  take  our  pis- 
tols to  bed  and  wake  up  the 
city  at  midnight  like  drunken 
bandits  celebrating  with  a 
fusillade,  the  message  of  the 
taste  of  chaos”.

seven  consecutive  matches. 
The  best  match  of  the  season 
took  place  within  these  seven 
matches. 

On  September  11,  the 
team  of  D.J.,  Drew,  Tucker, 
and  Larry  traveled  to  McCabe 
golf  course  and  country  club 
to  play  Brentwood  High. 
Highlighted  by  a chipped  in 
eagle  by  Tucker  Warren  on 
the  third  hole,  the  team  shot  a 
one-over  par  141  crushing 
Brentwood  by  19  strokes. 
Tucker  shot  a two-under  33, 
D.J.  finished  at  34,  Drew 
came  in  even  par  35.  and 
Larry  a 39.  Unfortunately 
soon  after  this  inspirational 
win,  the  team  took  its  second 
loss  to  Goodpasture.  Only  Six 
days  latter  MBA  came  back  to 


win  the  rematch  by  only  one 
stroke.  With  only  two  losses, 
the  varsity  completed  its  sea- 
son with  no  more.  The  re- 
venge was  sweetest  against 
reigning  district  and  regional 
champs  Ryan  who  were  de- 
feated by  thirteen  late  in  the 
season. 

This  year’s  addition  of  a 
B-team  or  Junior  Varsity  al- 
lowed many  more  people  to 
play  in  the  tournament  envi- 
ronment. Several  members  of 
the  J-V  got  to  plat  in  varsity 
matches  as  well.  These  people 
were:  Greg  Jones.  Brent 
Miller,  Roe  Elam,  Jeremy 
Hagan,  Kyle  Hatcher,  and 
Charlie  Malone.  Greg  Jones 
was  also  elected  the  official 
spokesman  for  this  year’s 
golfers. 


rPhe  1991  edition  of  the 
J.V.  football  teal  opened 
its  season  at  Overton  on  Sep- 
tember. 16,  after  six  weeks  of 
practice  with  the  varsity.  The 
squad,  comprised  of  some 
juniors  and  sophomores, 
played  hard  but  lost  in  a de- 
fensive struggle  6-2. 

Highlights  of  the 
game  were:  the  sack  of  the 
Wildcat  quarterback,  causing 
a safety;  the  tackling  prowess 
of  linebackers  Brad  Maggart, 
Ed  Martin,  and  Derrick  Buck- 
span;  Baker  Eadie's  recep- 
tions; and  the  passing  of 
Parkes  Owen. 

After  this  disap- 
pointing loss,  the  J.V.  waited 
for  two  weeks  to  avenge  their 


Will  Berry 

previous  defeat.  On  Monday, 
September  30,  the  firebirds  of 
Pearl-Cohn  invaded  MBA. 

The  Big  Red  started 
strong,  jumping  out  to  a 19-0 
lead  by  capitalizing  on  Fire- 
bird miscues.  Brad  Maggart ’s 
return  of  a fumbled  kick-off 
led  to  one  touchdown,  and 
Parkes  Owen’s  six-yard 
touchdown  pass  accounted 
for  another. 

Late  in  the  third 
quarter,  the  Big  Red  became  a 
little  complacent  as  Pearl- 
Cohn  running  backs  broke 
multiple  long  runs,  and  even- 
tually took  the  lead  20-19, 
with  a touchdown  late  in  the 
fourth  quarter. 

The  Big  Red,  how- 


ever, would  not  be  denied  a 
victory  and  refused  to  quit.  A 
last  gasp  drive  ended  with  a 
dramatic  game-winning  field 
goal  by  Bobby  Zaph  with 
twenty-five  seconds  remain- 
ing, for  a 22-20  win. 

Leading  the  offen- 
sive charge  was  the  line  of 
Berry,  Rose,  Gavigan,  Mag- 
gart, and  Russel.  Standing  out 
on  the  defensive  side  of  the 
ball  were  Bradley  Sloan, 
Harrison  Johnston,  Hal  Pick- 
ell,  and  the  house  himself. 
Ford  Simpkins.  The  punt  re- 
turns of  Julian  Bibb  also  were 
integral  to  the  success  of  the 
team.

After  defeating 
three  strong  opponents,  the 
Big  Red  regrouped  and  at- 
tempted to  avoid  a let-down 
by  the  always  dangerous 
Pearl-Cohn  Firebirds. 

A thirty-yard  touch- 
down run  set  the  tone  for  the 
game.  By  capitalizing  on 
numerous  Firebird  miscues, 
the  Big  Red  rolled  to  a 34-12 
victory.

touchdowns  along  with  R.A.

Upcoming  games 
for  the  Big  Red  are  three  con-

full  back  Dave  Sifford  and 
wing  back  Billy  Hemcade  on 
the  grand,  the  Fresh  battled 
the  entire  day. 

In  the  first  half.  Ryan 
took  an  early  7-0  lead.  The 
MBA  offense  stalled  and  no 
drive  was  effaced  until  the 
second  half.  In  the  second 
half,  MBA  had  the  ball  inside 
the  20  four  times,  yet  the 
Fresh  could  not  connect.  Then 
with  only  minutes  remaining 
and  the  ball  on  the  one-inch 


line,  the  Fresh  fumbled  on  a 
second-and-goal  play.  With 
that  fumble,  Ryan  snuffed  out 
any  hopes  for  a Fresh  victory. 

Despite  the  loss,  the  Fresh 
showed  a strong  defense  as 
Buck  Blair  stepped  in  to  play 
well.  Also,  Dave  Sifford  and 
Straton  Huggins  played 
strong  line  backers.  Other  key 
players  were  Jeff  Dale.

Golf  Report 


A fter  the  hot  August 
two-a-days  and  sev- 
eral scrimmages,  the  Big  Red 
was  eager  to  begin  its  season 
against  the  strong  Dragons  of 
Warren  Central  in  Bowling 
Green. 

After  a Dragon 
fumble  on  their  first  posses- 
sion, the  Big  Red  capi- 
talized on  a short 
touchdown  by  Glenn 
Harris.  The  Dragons 
stormed  back  late  in 
the  first  quarter  with  a 
touchdown  drive  of 
their  own,  tying  the 
score. 

Before  inter- 
mission, the  teams  ex- 
changed touchdowns, 
but  a missed  field  goal 
gave  the  Big  Red  a one 
point  edge  at  halftime. 

In  the  third 
quarter,  the  defense 
led  by  Shad  Weaver, 

Eric  Crawford,  and 
Chris  Johnston  shut 
down  the  Dragon’s 
offense  and  provided 
the  Big  Red  with  the  field 
position  it  needed. 

Quarterback  Joe 
Underwood  then  led  a drive 
which  ended  in  Harris’s  third 
touchdown  of  the  game  with 
the  score  21-13.  After  a punt 
which  landed  on  the  ten  yard 


Will  Berry 

line,  the  Dragons  began  their 
final  drive  in  the  remaining 
two  minutes.  Exhibiting  a 
passing  offense  which  had 
been  non-existent,  Warren 
County  drove  deep  into  Big 
Red  territory.  The  defense 
came  up  big  in  the  clutch, 
however,  when  Joe  Under-

first  home  game  to  take  on  the 
Bobcats  of  Overton,  upon  the 
dedication  of  the  Tommy 
Owen  Stadium. 

After  the  emotional 
ceremony,  the  Big  Red  took 
the  field  to  defeat  the  Bobcats 
16-10.  Game  highlights  in- 
clude Andy  Russ’s  first 
field  goal  of  the  season, 
a touchdown  by  Glenn 
Harris,  and  the  overall 
defense,  which  with- 
stood the  Bobcats  high- 
powered  rushing  attack 
for  much  of  the  game. 

The  victory 
was  not  without  cost,  as 
Underwood  broke  his 
collar  in  the  second 
quarter.  R.A.  Dickey, 
Joe’s  backup,  filled  in 
capably  and  led  the 
team  to  victory. 

Dickey  was 
again  at  the  helm  when 
the  injury-plagued 
squad  traveled  to 
Cleveland,  Tennessee 
to  take  on  the  third 
ranked  team  in  the 

state. 

The  Big  Red  up- 
ended the  highly-touted  Raid- 
ers in  a game  of  muscles.  The 
defense  played  extremely 
well,  causing  three  fumbles 
and  intercepting  two  passes, 
both  by  Jackson  Wray. 

The  offense  moved 
into  scoring  territory  several 
times  resulting  in  two  long 
field  goals  by  Russ  and  a one 
yard  touchdown  run  by  Har- 
ris. 

A goal  line  stand  in 
the  second  quarter  changed 
the  momentum  of  the  game 
and  ultimately  led  to  the  vic- 
tory. 

A final  clock  con- 
suming drive  of  short  runs  by 
Weaver  and  Harris  behind  a 
strong  offensive  line  iced  the 
victory  13-10.

A s of  October  2,  the  1991 
MBA  golf  team  had 
been  very  successful  through 
the  regular  season  compiling 
a 13-2  record.  Coach 
Caldwell  is  bringing  back 
three  lettermen  from  last 
year’s  team:  D.J.  Salinas, 

Drew  Patterson,  and  Tom 
Lawrence.  Four  young  new- 
comers to  the  varsity  squad 
appeared  this  year  in  fresh- 
men Tucker  Warren,  Larry 
Underwood,  Richard 
Douglas,  and  Cooper  Jones. 


These  four  will  certainly  be  an 
asset  to  the  golf  team  in  future 
years. 

On  August  26,  the  team 
opened  its  season  at  scenic 
Ted  Rhodes  golf  course 
against  a very  experienced 
FRA  squad.  The  combination 
of  D.J.,  Drew,  Tucker,  and 
Cooper  shot  a 165,  but  was 
edged  out  by  only  five  strokes 
for  the  first  loss  of  the  season. 
The  Big  Red  rebounded 
quickly  to  win  the  next.  . .

rP  he  Freshman  Football 

team  is  off  to  a great  start. 
In  their  first  three  games,  they 
have  proven  successful  twice. 
Both  games  were  blowouts 
with  a combination  of  out- 
standing offensive  and  defen- 
sive play. 

In  the  first  game,  MBA 
faced  powerhouse  team  Strat- 
ford. The  freshman  got  off  to 
a slow  start,  letting  Stratford 
take  the  early  6-0  lead.  But  by 
the  end  of  the  first  half,  MBA 
extinguished  the  Spartans, 
producing  a 28-6  victory. 
According  to  coach  Herring, 
“The  solid  blocking  of  Greer 
and  Corts  helped  us  in  our 
win.” 

Next,  MBA  faced  Hill- 


wood  at  home.  The  Big  Red 
came  rolling  out  and  jumped 
to  an  early  lead.  On  the 
Fresh’s  first  possession,  J.T. 
Davenport  took  the  ball  and 
“bone  danced”  his  way 
through  the  line,  then  turned 
into  high  gear  all  the  way  to 
the  zone,  for  a seventy  yard 
touchdown.  Quarterbacks 
Andrew  Walker  and  Monty 
Poe  helped  to  lead  the  Fresh’s 
second  victory.  Also  with  the 
help  of  Ted  Morrissey  and 
Dave  Hoffsteader,  the  Fresh 
were  able  to  roll  another  28-6 
victory. 

In  the  third  game  against 
rival  Father  Ryan,  the  Fresh-
