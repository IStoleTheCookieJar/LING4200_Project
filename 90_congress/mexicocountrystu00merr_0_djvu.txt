Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared 
by  the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress 
under  the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program  spon- 
sored by  the  Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  two  pages  of  this 
book  list  the  other  published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  coun- 
try, describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and 
national  security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the 
interrelationships  of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are 
shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  factors.  Each  study  is  written 
by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists.  The  authors 
seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  society, 
striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular 
attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society, 
their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  common  inter- 
ests and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature  and 
extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should 
not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States 
government  position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have 
sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity. 
Corrections,  additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  read- 
ers will  be  welcomed  for  use  in  future  editions.

Preface 


Like  its  predecessor,  this  study  is  an  attempt  to  examine 
objectively  and  concisely  the  dominant  historical,  social,  eco- 
nomic, political,  and  military  aspects  of  contemporary  Mexico. 
Sources  of  information  included  scholarly  books,  journals, 
monographs,  official  reports  of  governments  and  international 
organizations,  and  numerous  periodicals.  Chapter  bibliogra- 
phies appear  at  the  end  of  the  book;  brief  comments  on 
sources  recommended  for  further  reading  appear  at  the  end  of 
each  chapter.  To  the  extent  possible,  place-names  follow  the 
system  adopted  by  the  United  States  Board  on  Geographic 
Names.  Measurements  are  given  in  the  metric  system;  a  conver- 
sion table  is  provided  to  assist  readers  unfamiliar  with  metric 
measurements  (see  table  1,  Appendix  A).  A  glossary  is  also 
included. 

Although  there  are  numerous  variations,  Spanish  surnames 
for  men  and  unmarried  women  usually  consist  of  two  parts:  the 
patrilineal  name  followed  by  the  matrilineal.  In  the  instance  of 
Luis  Echeverria  Alvarez,  for  example,  Echeverria  is  his  father's 
name;  Alvarez,  his  mother's  maiden  name.  In  informal  use,  the 
matrilineal  name  is  often  dropped.  When  a  woman  marries, 
she  generally  drops  her  matrilineal  name  and  replaces  it  with 
her  husband's  patrilineal  name  preceded  by  a  "de."  Thus,  when 
Cristina  Garcia  Rodriguez  marries  Antonio  Perez  Cevallos,  she 
becomes  Cristina  Garcia  de  Perez.  In  informal  use,  a  married 
woman's  patrilineal  name  is  dropped  (Cristina  Perez  is  the 
informal  usage).  Some  individuals  use  only  the  patrilineal 
name  in  formal  as  well  as  informal  use.  The  patrilineal  for  men 
and  unmarried  women  and  the  husband's  patrilineal  for  mar- 
ried women  are  used  for  indexing  and  bibliographic  purposes. 

The  body  of  the  text  reflects  information  available  as  of  May 
1996.  Certain  other  portions  of  the  text,  however,  have  been 
updated.  The  Introduction  discusses  significant  events  that 
have  occurred  since  the  completion  of  research;  the  Country 
Profile  and  Glossary  include  updated  information  as  available; 
several  figures  and  tables  are  based  on  information  in  more 
recently  published  sources;  and  the  Bibliography  lists  recent 
sources  thought  to  be  particularly  helpful  to  the  reader.

Drainage:  Few  navigable  rivers.  Most  rivers  short  and  run  from 
mountain  ranges  to  coast. 

Climate:  Great  variations  owing  to  considerable  north-south 
extension  and  variations  in  altitude.  Most  of  country  has  two 
seasons:  wet  (June-September)  and  dry  (October-April). 
Generally  low  rainfall  in  interior  and  north.  Abundant  rainfall 
along  east  coast,  in  south,  and  in  Yucatan  Peninsula. 

Society 

Population:  Estimated  population  of  94.8  million  persons  in 
mid-1996.  Annual  rate  of  growth  1.96  percent. 

Language:  Spanish  official  language,  spoken  by  nearly  all. 
About  8  percent  of  population  speaks  an  indigenous  language; 
most  of  these  people  speak  Spanish  as  second  language. 
Knowledge  of  English  increasing  rapidly,  especially  among 
business  people,  the  middle  class,  returned  emigrants,  and  the 
young. 

Ethnic  Groups:  Predominantly  mestizo  society  (60  percent);  30

graduate  students.  Life  expectancy  in  1996  estimated  at 
seventy-three  years.  Infant  mortality  twenty-six  per  1,000  live 
births.  Leading  causes  of  death  infections,  parasitic  diseases, 
and  respiratory  and  circulatory  system  failures. 

Religion:  About  90  percent  of  population  Roman  Catholic, 
according  to  1990  census.  Protestants  (about  6  percent) 
ranked  second.  Number  of  Protestants  has  increased 
dramatically  since  1960s,  especially  in  southern  states. 

Economy 

Overview:  From  a  colonial  economy  based  largely  on  mining, 
especially  silver,  in  the  twentieth  century,  the  economy  has 
diversified  to  include  strong  agriculture,  petroleum,  and 
industry  sectors.  Strong  growth  from  1940-80  interrupted  by 
series  of  economic  crises,  caused  in  part  by  massive 
overborrowing.  1980s  marked  by  inflation  and  lowering 
standard  of  living.  Austerity  measures  and  introduction  of  free- 
market  policies  led  to  a  period  of  growth  from  1990-94. 
Membership  in  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement 
(NAFTA)  in  1993  led  to  hopes  of  continued  economic  growth. 
However,  growing  trade  deficit  and  overvalued  exchange  rate 
in  1994  financed  by  sale  of  short-term  bonds  and  foreign- 
exchange  reserves.  Series  of  political  shocks  and  devaluation  of 
new  peso  in  late  1994  caused  investor  panic.  Inflation  soared, 
and  massive  foreign  intervention  was  required  to  stabilize 
situation.  Although  overall  economy  remains  fundamentally 
strong,  lack  of  confidence  makes  short-term  prospects  for 
strong  growth  unlikely. 

Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP):  Estimated  at  US$370  billion 
in  1994;  approximately  US$4,100  per  capita. 

Currency  and  Exchange  Rate:  Relatively  stable  throughout 
most  of  twentieth  century,  the  peso  (Mex$)  began  to 
depreciate  rapidly  during  economic  crisis  of  1980s.  In  January 
1993,  peso  replaced  by  new  peso  (NMex$)  at  rate  of  NMex$l  = 
Mex$l,000.  Exchange  rate  in  January  1993,  US$1  =  NMex$3.1; 
rate  in  April  1997,  US$1  =  NMex$7.9. 

Agriculture:  Contributed  8.1  percent  of  GDP  in  1994.  Main 
crops  for  domestic  consumption  corn,  beans,  wheat,  and  rice. 
Leading  agricultural  exports  coffee,  cotton,  vegetables,  fruit, 


xxv 


livestock,  and  tobacco. 

Industry:  Mining,  manufacturing,  and  construction 
contributed  28  percent  of  GDP  in  1994.  Industrialization 
increased  rapidly  after  1940.  By  1990  large  and  diversified 
industrial  base  located  largely  in  industrial  triangle  of  Mexico 
City,  Monterrey,  and  Guadalajara.  Most  industrial  goods 
produced,  including  automobiles,  consumer  goods,  steel,  and 
petrochemicals.  World's  sixth  largest  producer  of  petroleum 
and  major  producer  of  nonfuel  minerals. 

Energy:  More  than  120  billion  kilowatt-hours  produced  in 
1993,  about  75  percent  from  thermal  (mostly  oil-burning) 
plants,  20  percent  from  hydroelectric,  and  the  rest  from 
nuclear  or  geothermal  plants.  One  nuclear  plant  with  two 
reactors  at  Laguna  Verde  in  Veracruz  State.  Huge  petroleum 
deposits  discovered  in  Gulf  of  Mexico  in  1970s.  In  1995  sixth- 
largest  producer  of  oil  and  had  eighth-largest  proven  reserves. 

Exports:  US$60.8  billion  in  1994.  Manufactured  exports 
include  processed  food  products,  textiles,  chemicals, 
machinery,  and  steel.  Other  important  export  items  are  metals 
and  minerals,  livestock,  fish,  and  agricultural  products.  Major 
exports  to  United  States  are  petroleum,  automotive  engines, 
silver,  shrimp,  coffee,  and  winter  vegetables. 

Imports:  US$79.4  billion  in  1994.  Main  imports  are  metal- 
working  machines,  steel-mill  products,  agricultural  machines, 
chemicals,  and  capital  goods.  Leading  imports  from  United 
States  include  motor  vehicle  parts,  automatic  data  processing 
parts,  aircraft  repair  parts,  car  parts  for  assembly,  and  paper 
and  paperboard. 

Debt:  Massive  foreign  debt.  Buoyed  by  discovery  of  large 
petroleum  reserves,  government  borrowed  heavily  in  1970s. 
When  severe  recession  hit  in  1982,  government  declared 
moratorium  on  debt  payments,  precipitating  international 
economic  crisis.  Austerity  measures  and  renegotiation  of  the 
debt  eased  crisis,  but  in  1995  debt  stood  at  US$158.2  billion. 

Balance  of  Payments:  Large  trade  deficits  from  1989  to  1993 
pushed  current  account  deeply  into  deficit.  Dramatic 
improvement  in  trade  balance  in  1994  and  1995,  however, 
nearly  eliminated  deficit.  Heavy  international  borrowing 
allowed  international  reserves  to  rise  to  US$15.7  billion  at  end 
of  1995. 

Fiscal  Year:  Calendar  year.

Transportation  and  Telecommunications 


Roads:  Extensive  system  of  roads  linking  all  areas.  More  than 
240,000  kilometers  of  roads,  of  which  85,000  paved  (more  than 
3,100  kilometers  expressway).  Heaviest  concentration  in 
central  Mexico.  Many  roads  in  poor  condition  as  result  of  lack 
of  maintenance  and  heavy  truck  traffic. 

Railroads:  More  than  20,000  kilometers.  Standard  gauge, 
largely  government-owned.  System  concentrated  in  north  and 
central  areas.  Numerous  connections  to  United  States 
railroads;  system  largely  used  for  freight  and  in  need  of 
modernization.  Extensive,  heavily  used  subway  system  in 
Mexico  City;  smaller  subway  in  Guadalajara. 

Ports:  No  good  natural  harbors.  On  east  coast,  Veracruz  is 
principal  port  for  cargo;  Tampico,  Coatzacoalcos,  and 
Progreso  handle  petroleum.  Guaymas,  Mazatlan,  and 
Manzanillo  are  principal  ports  on  Pacific. 

Air  Transport:  Adequate  system  of  airlines  and  airports.  More 
than  1,500  airstrips  in  1994,  of  which  202  had  permanent- 
surface  runways.  Principal  international  airport  in  Mexico  City; 
other  international  airports  in  Monterrey,  Guadalajara, 
Merida,  and  Cancun.  Aeromexico  is  main  domestic  airline. 

Telecommunications:  Highly  developed  system  undergoing 
expansion  and  privatization.  Long-distance  telephone  calls  go 
via  mix  of  microwave  and  domestic  satellite  links  with  120 
ground  stations.  International  calls  via  five  satellite  ground 
stations  and  microwave  links  to  United  States.  Demand  still 
exceeds  supply  for  new  telephones  in  homes,  but  situation 
improving.  More  than  600  mediumwave  amplitude  modulation 
(AM)  stations,  privately  owned.  Twenty-two  shortwave  AM 
stations.  Almost  300  television  stations,  most  organized  into  two 
national  networks. 

Government  and  Politics 

Government:  Constitution  of  1917  in  force  in  1997.  Formally  a 
federal  republic,  although  federal  government  dominates 
governments  of  thirty-one  states  and  Federal  District.  Central 
government  power  concentrated  in  president,  who  directs 
activities  of  numerous  agencies  and  state-owned  business 
enterprises.  Bicameral  legislature  (128-member  Senate  and 


XXVI 1 


500-member  Chamber  of  Deputies)  relatively  weak.  Federal 
judiciary  headed  by  Supreme  Court  of  Justice.  State 
governments  headed  by  elected  governors;  all  states  have 
unicameral  legislatures;  state  courts  subordinate  to  federal 
courts.  Federal  District  governed  by  mayor  (regente)  indirectly 
elected  by  legislative  body  of  the  Federal  District  beginning  in 
1996;  more  than  2,000  local  governments  headed  by  elected

organization  Institutional  Revolutionary  Party  (Partido 
Revolucionario  Institucional — PRI),  which  incorporates 
peasant  groups,  labor  unions,  and  many  middle-class 
organizations  within  its  ranks.  Many  opposition  parties  have 
had  limited  electoral  success;  largest  is  the  conservative  Party  of 
National  Action  (Partido  de  Accion  Nacional — PAN).  Direct 
elections  at  regular  intervals;  rule  of  no  reelection  applies  to 
most  offices.  Election  by  majority  vote,  except  for  200  seats  in 
Chamber  of  Deputies  reserved  for  opposition  parties  chosen  by 
proportional  representation.  Extensive  participation  by 
interest  groups  and  labor  unions  in  government  and  PRI 
affairs. 

Foreign  Relations:  Major  attention  devoted  to  United  States. 
Trade  and  immigration  along  shared  border  subjects  of 
continuing  negotiations.  Foreign  policy  traditionally  based  on 
international  law;  nonintervendon  the  major  principle.  Widely 
active  in  hemispheric  affairs,  including  good  relations  with 
Cuba.

Women  serving  in  armed  forces  have  same  legal  rights  and 
duties  as  men  but  in  practice  not  eligible  to  serve  in  combat 
positions,  be  admitted  to  service  academies,  or  be  promoted 
beyond  rank  equivalent  of  major  general  in  United  States 
armed  forces. 

Military  Units:  Two  government  ministries  responsible  for 
national  defense:  Secretariat  of  National  Defense  and 
Secretariat  of  the  Navy.  Country  divided  into  nine  military 
regions  with  thirty-six  military  zones.  Each  military  zone  usually 
assigned  at  least  two  infantry  battalions  composed  of  some  300 
troops  each;  some  zones  also  assigned  cavalry  regiments  (now 
motorized)  or  one  of  three  artillery  battalions.  Personnel 
assigned  to  air  force  also  within  command  structure  of 
Secretariat  of  National  Defense,  distributed  among  air  base

of  new  vessels — most  domestically  built.  Plans  for  additional 
acquisitions  from  abroad  constrained  by  country's  economic 
problems.

Introduction 


CULTURALLY,  POLITICALLY,  AND  ECONOMICALLY,  Mex- 
ico is  a  nation  undergoing  rapid  change.  Past  characterizations 
of  the  country  as  rural,  undemocratic,  and  protectionist  have 
been  replaced  in  the  last  decades  of  the  twentieth  century  by 
descriptions  that  refer  to  Mexico  as  urban,  opening  to  democ- 
racy, and  market-oriented.  For  a  country  composed  mostly  of 
peasants  before  the  Revolution  (1910-20),  Mexico  has  under- 
gone broad  and  rapid  urbanization;  Mexico  City  has  emerged 
as  one  of  the  world's  largest  cities  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth 
century.  Throughout  most  of  its  history,  Mexico  has  been  ruled 
by  strongmen  or  a  one-party  system;  in  1997  pressures  for  an 
open  democracy  are  greater  than  ever.  Under  the  presidencies 
of  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari  (1988-94)  and  Ernesto  Zedillo 
Ponce  de  Leon  (1994-  ),  the  economy,  long  one  of  the  most 
protectionist  and  statist  of  the  nonsocialist  countries,  dramati- 
cally about-faced,  embracing  open-market  policies  and  free- 
trade  links  with  the  United  States  and  countries  throughout 
the  Americas. 

Mexico's  history  is  long.  Although  the  timing  of  the  arrival 
of  the  first  inhabitants  to  the  Americas  has  been  a  point  of 
major  controversy  among  archaeologists,  recent  archaeological 
findings  indicate  that  tribes  from  northeast  Asia  walked  across 
what  is  now  the  Bering  Straits  perhaps  as  early  as  35,000  years 
ago.  Finding  abundant  wildlife  these  peoples  gradually  moved 
south,  populating  the  entire  Americas  over  the  next  several 
thousand  years. 

In  the  area  of  present-day  Mexico,  the  earliest  settlers  found 
a  rugged  and  varied  topography  with  only  limited  areas  suited 
for  human  habitation.  Viewed  from  space,  modern  Mexico 
roughly  resembles  a  cornucopia,  wide  at  the  top  but  narrowing 
and  curving  to  the  east  as  it  stretches  southward.  At  the  south- 
ern tip  of  the  "cornucopia,"  the  rectangular  Yucatan  Peninsula, 
described  by  some  as  a  thumb,  extends  northward  into  the  Car- 
ibbean Sea.  Another  discongruous  piece  of  land,  the  Baja  Cali- 
fornia Peninsula,  is  a  long  sliver  of  land  offshore  and  paral- 
leling the  northwest  coast. 

The  land  itself  is  characterized  by  a  roughly  Y-shaped  series 
of  mountain  ranges.  The  two  forks  of  the  Yare  rugged  ranges 
that  parallel  the  northern  parts  of  the  Pacific  and  Gulf  of  Mex-

ico  coasts.  The  base  of  the  Yis  a  spine  of  mountains,  with  occa- 
sional breaks,  that  extends  from  central  Mexico  into 
Guatemala  on  the  south.  The  center  of  the  Yis  a  knot  of  active 
volcanoes  in  the  center  of  the  country,  just  south  of  Mexico 
City.  Between  the  two  northern  ranges  lies  a  high  arid  plateau, 
and  the  small  coastal  plains  outside  these  mountain  ranges  are 
tropical  rain  forests.  The  Yucatan  Peninsula  is  a  flat  humid  jun- 
gle, and  the  Baja  California  Peninsula  is  a  desert  with  yet 
another  low  mountain  range  running  down  its  center. 

Although  most  of  the  land  has  warm  temperatures  year 
round,  lack  of  rainfall  and  rugged  terrain  were  obstacles  for 
the  early  inhabitants.  Only  the  narrow  coastal  plains,  the 
Yucatan  Peninsula,  and  a  few  valleys  in  the  southern  area  of  the 
central  plateau  or  in  the  volcanic  central  regions  receive  reli- 
able rainfall  for  crops.  Despite  these  constrictions,  evidence 
indicates  that  between  7000  B.C.  and  2000  B.C.,  corn  had  been 
domesticated,  and  agricultural  villages  had  sprung  up.  By  1500 
B.C.,  the  Olmec,  the  first  of  a  string  of  civilizations  in  Middle 
America,  flourished. 

The  next  three  millennia  would  see  a  series  of  civilizations, 
each  built  on  some  of  the  advancements  and  traditions  of  its 
predecessors.  After  the  Olmec  in  what  is  now  called  the  Classic 
Period  (0-A.D.  700),  the  Teotihuacan,  Veracruz,  and  Monte 
Alban  cultures  built  large  ceremonial  cities  in  south-central 
and  eastern  Mexico.  From  A.D.  700  to  A.D.  900  in  the  Yucatan, 
the  classic  phase  of  the  Maya  civilization,  considered  by  most 
archaeologists  to  be  the  most  advanced  pre-Columbian  civiliza- 
tion in  the  Americas,  was  at  its  zenith.  After  A.D.  900,  the  cen- 
ter of  power  and  culture  shifted  to  the  Valley  of  Mexico,  site  of 
present-day  Mexico  City,  with  the  development  of  the  Toltec 
and  finally  the  Aztec  empires. 

The  destruction  of  the  Aztec  Empire  by  the  Spanish  conquis- 
tadors in  1519  was  one  of  the  most  decisive  events  in  Mexican 
history.  Aided  by  superior  firepower  and  technology,  and  carry- 
ing deadly  diseases  for  which  the  native  inhabitants  had  no 
immunity,  a  band  of  several  hundred  European  soldiers  of  for- 
tune overran  an  empire  of  millions  of  inhabitants.  In  one  of 
history's  greatest  epic  stories,  one  which  still  reverberates  in  the 
Mexican  psyche  of  today,  a  great  civilization  was  virtually  wiped 
out  and  replaced  by  an  alien  culture  and  political  system.  The 
Aztec  capital  of  Tenochtitlan  was  leveled,  and  atop  the  ruins 
the  Spanish  built  Mexico  City,  capital  of  half  of  their  vast  colo- 
nial empire  in  the  New  World.

Fueled  by  its  rich  silver  mines,  a  new  colonial  society 
emerged  stratified  by  race  and  wealth.  The  upper  echelon  was 
European,  in  the  middle  were  people  of  mixed  European- 
indigenous  heritage,  and  at  the  bottom  were  the  descendants 
of  the  native  peoples  who  had  survived  the  European 
onslaught  of  the  1500s.  The  Roman  Catholic  Church  was  omni- 
present in  all  aspects  of  society,  religion,  and  education.  The 
colony  was  ruled  by  a  viceroy  appointed  by  the  king  of  Spain. 

Troubled  by  turmoil  in  Europe  and  influenced  by  the  liberal 
ideas  of  French  and  American  philosophers  and  the  French 
and  American  revolutions,  voices  in  Mexico  began  agitating  for 
independence  in  the  late  1700s  and  early  1800s.  The  formal 
break  began  with  a  proclamation  by  Father  Miguel  Hidalgo  on 
September  16,  1810.  The  struggle  for  independence  was  long 
and  fitful,  however,  and  freedom  from  Spain  was  not  finally 
realized  until  1821. 

Despite  hopes  that  independence  would  bring  political  and 
economic  change  for  the  nation's  masses,  in  reality  the  only 
change  was  in  the  country's  ruler.  For  the  next  several  decades, 
various  strongmen  held  power.  A  disastrous  war  in  1848 
resulted  in  the  country  ceding  more  than  half  its  territory  to 
the  United  States.  A  civil  war  in  the  late  1850s  set  the  stage  for  a 
brief  democratic  interlude  under  President  Benito  Juarez,  a 
French  occupation  and  the  establishment  of  an  empire  under 
Maximilian  I,  and  finally  the  beginning  of  a  dictatorship  in 
1871  under  Porfirio  Diaz  that  would  last  four  decades. 

Historians'  view  of  the  Porfiriato,  as  the  dictatorship  of  Por- 
firio Diaz  is  called,  is  a  schizophrenic  one.  On  the  one  hand, 
the  dictator  opened  the  country  to  development,  building  a 
modern  system  of  railroads,  roads,  factories,  and  schools.  On 
the  other  hand  (and  this  is  the  view  stressed  in  Mexico's  version 
of  its  history),  the  wealth  generated  by  this  period  of  political 
stability  and  increased  trade  was  concentrated  in  a  small  upper 
class  while  the  condition  of  the  lower  classes  degenerated. 
Indigenous  traditions  or  associations  were  totally  rejected  while 
European  fashion  and  mores  were  slavishly  imitated. 

In  1910  the  pent-up  resentment  of  the  lower  classes  coin- 
cided with  the  political  disaffection  of  middle-class  intellectu- 
als, producing  the  series  of  violent  political  convulsions  known 
as  the  Mexican  Revolution.  Rebel  groups  sprang  up  across  the 
nation,  and  Diaz  resigned.  Instead  of  uniting,  however,  the 
rebel  groups  soon  turned  on  each  other.  Various  men,  sup- 
ported by  one  of  the  rebel  factions  or  remnants  of  the  former 


xxxv 


central  government,  held  the  presidency  in  rapid  succession  as 
fighting  swept  back  and  forth  over  the  country.  Although  they 
disagreed  over  who  should  run  the  country,  the  leaders  of  the 
Revolution  were  united  in  their  calls  for  social  justice,  land 
reform,  and  a  new  sense  of  nationalism  based  on  Mexico's 
indigenous  heritage.  When  the  fighting  finally  ended  in  1920, 
the  ideals  that  they  evoked  defined  the  new  Mexican  nation 
that  emerged. 

The  constitution  of  1917,  still  in  effect,  established  the 
present-day  framework  of  Mexican  politics.  A  strong  president 
with  a  six-year  term,  a  relatively  weak  legislature  dominated  by 
the  party  of  the  Revolution,  and  a  nominally  independent  judi- 
ciary were  all  established.  The  Roman  Catholic  Church  was 
stripped  of  most  of  its  properties  and  formal  power.  Much  of 
the  land  was  taken  from  large  landowners  and  organized  into 
ejidos  (see  Glossary,),  or  communes,  for  peasants  to  work. 
Heavily  influenced  by  foreign  liberal  and  leftist  ideas  and  born 
of  a  popular  revolution  against  oppression,  the  constitution 
had  a  decided  revolutionary  cast.  The  National  Revolutionary 
Party  (Partido  Nacional  Revolucionario — PNR)  was  formed  in 
1929  to  successfully  carry  out  the  constitution's  goals  (the  party 
later  added  the  adjective  "institutional"  to  indicate  the  consoli- 
dation of  the  redistribution  phase  of  the  revolutionary  pro- 
gram— Partido  Revolucionario  Institucional — PRI). 

The  extent  to  which  post-revolutionary  administrations  have 
implemented  revolutionary  ideals  has  been  a  benchmark  by 
which  Mexican  historians  have  generally  judged  these  adminis- 
trations. Administrations  in  the  1920s  and  1930s  adhered  to 
these  goals  more  faithfully,  the  most  significant  act  during 
these  years  being  the  nationalization  of  the  petroleum  indus- 
try. Post-1940  governments,  however,  seemed  more  concerned 
with  political  stability  and  economic  growth  than  with  land 
reform  or  new  social  programs. 

The  Revolution  also  had  a  profound  effect  on  the  role  of  the 
military.  Formerly  one  of  the  largest  and  most  influential  play- 
ers in  Mexican  politics,  the  armed  forces  were  reduced  in  size 
after  1920  and  their  role  redefined  as  one  of  guaranteeing 
domestic  political  stability.  Quelling  social  unrest  and  eliminat- 
ing guerrilla  activity  became  their  primary  duties.  As  "servants 
of  the  people,"  units  were  more  likely  to  be  involved  in  devel- 
opment-oriented civic  action  than  in  training  to  defend  the 
country  from  foreign  intervention.

The  Revolution  added  another  irritant  in  the  frequently 
stormy  relations  between  the  governments  of  Mexico  and  the 
United  States.  Long  at  odds  over  a  variety  of  issues — including 
Mexican  bitterness  over  territory  lost  in  the  Mexican  War  of 
1848  and  political  and  military  interventions  by  the  United 
States  in  Mexican  affairs — the  United  States  was  alarmed  by  the 
leftist  tone  of  revolutionary  rhetoric  and  Mexico's  friendliness 
with  socialist  governments  and  revolutionary  movements 
worldwide.  Often  fueled  by  unspoken  prejudices  and  stereo- 
types on  both  sides,  friction  between  the  two  countries  some- 
times resulted  in  chilly  relations  and  bitter  denunciations  by 
politicians.  Not  until  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century,  when 
the  two  countries  realized  how  economically  interdependent 
they  had  become,  did  the  rhetoric  cool  and  genuine  attempts 
at  cooperation  and  understanding  each  other's  political  posi- 
tion occur. 

Economic  growth  was  probably  the  most  significant  legacy  of 
the  PRI  in  the  mid-twentieth  century.  From  1940  to  1980, 
growth  was  rapid  and  sustained.  The  nation's  vast  mineral 
wealth  was  exploited.  Petroleum  reserves,  estimated  to  be 
among  the  largest  in  the  world,  were  used  by  the  government 
to  develop  new  petrochemical  industries.  Agriculture  diversi- 
fied and  expanded,  and  government  planners  gave  particular 
emphasis  to  the  development  of  new  crops  for  export.  The 
industrial  sector  accounted  for  an  ever  larger  share  of  the 
economy,  and  maquiladoras  (see  Glossary),  or  assembly  plants 
along  the  United  States  border,  grew  exponentially.  By  1980 
Mexico  was  the  world's  fifteenth  largest  industrial  nation. 

Although  the  numbers  of  Mexicans  who  could  be  classified 
as  middle  class  rose,  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  were  not 
shared  by  all  of  Mexico's  citizens.  The  stark  inequality  that  had 
characterized  Mexico  at  the  turn  of  the  century  was  not  signifi- 
cantly ameliorated  by  the  processes  of  modernization  that 
began  in  the  1940s.  Despite  the  economy's  rapid  growth  rate  in 
the  post-World  War  II  period,  an  even  faster  rate  of  population 
growth  meant  that  the  economy  could  not  produce  sufficient 
jobs  for  the  many  millions  of  young  people  entering  the  work- 
force every  year.  The  exhaustion  of  the  land  available  for  redis- 
tribution in  the  1950s  also  created  conditions  of  severe  rural 
unemployment.  Beginning  in  the  1950s,  rural-to-urban  migra- 
tion began  to  change  the  face  of  Mexico  from  a  predominantly 
rural  to  an  urban  society.  The  search  for  work  often  resulted  in 
displaced  workers  living  in  worse  conditions  than  before.  The 


xxxvii 


population  of  Mexico  City,  for  example,  swelled  to  15  million 
in  the  1990s,  with  millions  living  in  miserable  slums  on  hillsides 
or  on  marginal  land  on  the  outskirts  of  the  city.  Statistics  on 
standard  of  living  indices  showed  improvement  in  some  urban 
areas  and  throughout  the  north,  but  few  improvements  in  the 
south,  where  Mexico's  population  tended  to  be  more  rural  and 
more  heavily  mestizo  or  indigenous. 

The  PRI's  legacy  of  political  stability  and  economic  growth 
generated  little  enthusiasm  or  gratitude  among  the  Mexican 
people.  In  fact,  the  opposite  occurred,  as  the  rise  of  an  urban 
middle  class  produced  pressures  for  political  reform  during 
the  1980s.  Either  by  legal  or  fraudulent  means,  the  PRI  consis- 
tently won  every  election  at  the  state  and  national  levels,  ced- 
ing only  the  occasional  municipality  to  the  conservative 
National  Action  Party  (Partido  de  Accion  Nacional — PAN)  or 
to  government-financed  "satellite"  parties.  Widespread  corrup- 
tion only  heightened  cynicism.  Corruption  became  synony- 
mous with  all  government  dealings,  from  the  presidency  to 
daily  life,  where  most  Mexicans  had  to  bribe  petty  government 
officials  to  obtain  basic  public  services.  The  PRI,  the  party  of 
revolutionary  change  in  the  early  years  of  the  century,  was  now 
seen  as  the  primary  obstacle  to  reform. 

Beginning  in  the  mid-1980s,  the  PRI's  overwhelming  domi- 
nance over  the  political  system  began  to  decline.  The  massive 
earthquake  that  struck  Mexico  City  in  1985  underscored  the 
corruption  and  ineptitude  of  the  authorities,  who  were  slow  to 
provide  relief  to  the  hundreds  of  thousands  made  homeless  by 
the  natural  catastrophe.  Spurred  by  government  inaction,  hun- 
dreds of  nongovernmental  civic  associations  arose  in  the  after- 
math of  the  Mexico  City  earthquake.  In  addition  to  providing 
resources  for  community  self-help,  many  of  these  new  organiza- 
tions became  a  nucleus  for  opposition  political  activity  during 
the  latter  1980s. 

The  national  elections  of  1988  were  a  turning  point  in  twen- 
tieth-century Mexican  politics.  For  the  first  time  in  its  six 
decades  of  continuous  rule,  the  PRI's  presidential  candidate 
faced  a  formidable  challenger  in  the  person  of  Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas,  a  former  PRI  leader  who  had  defected  from  the 
party  because  of  its  emerging  free-market  stance  and  its  author- 
itarian practices.  Ironically,  Cardenas  was  the  son  of  one  of  the 
PRI's  greatest  national  heros,  President  Lazaro  Cardenas 
(1934-40).  During  the  late  1930s  and  early  1940s,  the  elder 
Cardenas  had  assured  his  place  in  the  annals  of  Mexican  his- 


xxxviii 


tory  by  reviving  the  country's  moribund  land  reform  and  by 
taking  the  unprecedented  step  of  nationalizing  the  foreign- 
owned  oil  companies  in  Mexico. 

After  an  intense  campaign  that  was  bitterly  fought  by  both 
sides,  the  PRI's  candidate,  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari,  was 
declared  the  winner.  The  election  results,  which  were  delayed 
by  a  week  because  of  a  mysterious  breakdown  of  the  electoral 
computer  system,  were  immediately  contested  by  Cardenas  and 
his  supporters.  The  Cardenas  camp  alleged  that  the  PRI  had 
caused  the  computer  malfunction  and  had  systematically 
destroyed  thousands  of  ballots  to  produce  a  last-minute  victory 
for  its  candidate.  Despite  the  left's  protests,  Salinas  was  sworn 
in  as  president  in  December  1988.  The  ensuing  sexenio  (as 
Mexico's  six-year  presidential  term  is  commonly  known)  would 
be  characterized  by  the  most  dramatic  transition  in  Mexico's 
political  economy  since  the  1910  Revolution. 

As  he  began  his  presidential  term,  Salinas  appeared  to  most 
Mexicans  as  an  obscure  but  competent  figure  chosen  from 
among  several  contenders  within  the  cabinet  of  outgoing  Presi- 
dent Miguel  de  la  Madrid  Hurtado  (1982-88).  Salinas,  how- 
ever, faced  a  storm  of  opposition  protests  and  bitter  divisions 
within  his  own  party.  Moreover,  for  the  first  time  in  its  history, 
the  PRI  held  less  than  a  two-thirds  majority  in  the  national 
Congress,  a  fact  that  would  necessitate  cooperation  with  the 
congressional  opposition  in  order  to  pass  the  broad  constitu- 
tional reforms  needed  to  liberalize  the  economy. 

The  newly  elected  president  was  hard-pressed  in  the  first 
months  of  his  term  to  show  that  he  could  provide  the  strong 
leadership  expected  of  a  Mexican  head  of  state.  Salinas  was 
quick  to  assert  his  authority,  however.  Within  weeks  of  taking 
office,  he  ordered  the  army  to  arrest  the  corrupt  leader  of  the 
powerful  oil-workers  union,  who  had  been  a  vocal  opponent  of 
Salinas's  candidacy.  Throughout  his  term,  Salinas  repeatedly 
used  his  extensive  powers  to  remove  PRI  officials,  including 
several  state  governors  who  resisted  his  reform  efforts  or  whose 
fraudulent  election  victories  were  too  controversial  to  ignore. 

Despite  his  stated  commitment  to  democratization,  Presi- 
dent Salinas  significantly  augmented  the  already  formidable 
powers  of  the  executive  branch.  To  push  a  series  of  sweeping 
economic  reforms  through  the  political  system,  Salinas  concen- 
trated broad  policy-making  authority  in  a  technocratic  elite 
committed  to  market  economics,  trade  liberalization,  and  rap- 
prochement with  the  United  States.  By  the  early  1990s,  the  Sali- 


xxxix 


nas  administration's  priorities  had  become  clear.  Political 
reform  would  be  encouraged,  but  primary  emphasis  would  be 
placed  on  the  economic  aspects  of  modernization. 

Building  on  the  policies  of  President  de  la  Madrid,  the  Sali- 
nas administration  carried  out  a  comprehensive  structural 
transformation  of  the  Mexican  economy.  Salinas's  domestic 
macroeconomic  policies  put  into  practice  a  package  of  market- 
oriented  reforms  endorsed  by  the  United  States  and  interna- 
tional financial  organizations;  these  reforms  collectively 
became  known  as  the  "Washington  consensus."  The  three  pil- 
lars of  Mexico's  structural  adjustment  program  were  the  priva- 
tization of  the  country's  vast  network  of  parastatals,  the 
liberalization  of  its  foreign  trade,  and  the  modernization  of  its 
financial  system. 

It  was  through  its  comprehensive  economic  program,  rather 
than  its  political  reforms,  that  the  Salinas  administration  left  a 
lasting  impact  on  Mexico.  By  the  time  Salinas  entered  office, 
Mexico  had  already  dramatically  reversed  its  foreign  trade 
practices  by  acceding  to  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and 
Trade  (GATT — as  of  January  1995  became  known  as  the  World 
Trade  Organization)  in  August  1986.  As  a  result  of  its  accession 
to  GATT,  Mexico  unilaterally  lowered  its  average  tariff  level 
from  100  percent  ad  valorem  to  a  structure  with  a  top  rate  of  20 
percent.  At  the  same  time,  it  reduced  or  eliminated  many  non- 
tariff  barriers  such  as  import  licenses  and  quotas,  the  com- 
bined effect  of  which  had  been  to  close  the  Mexican  market  to 
most  foreign  imports  for  more  than  fifty  years. 

The  Salinas  administration  expanded  the  process  of  struc- 
tural adjustment  begun  by  its  predecessor.  A  key  element  of  the 
government's  structural  adjustment  program  was  the  privatiza- 
tion of  Mexico's  vast  network  of  parastatal  industries.  Between 
1986  and  1994,  the  government  privatized  more  than  700  state- 
owned  companies,  including  all  eighteen  government-owned 
commercial  banks,  the  national  telephone  company,  a  national 
television  network,  airlines,  movie  theaters,  several  sugar-  and 
food-processing  plants,  several  large  copper  mines,  steel  pro- 
duction facilities,  and  the  maritime  port  system.  The  sale  of 
state-owned  companies  generated  US$22  billion  in  govern- 
ment revenues,  the  majority  of  which  was  used  to  reduce  the 
massive  foreign  debt  and  to  finance  new  infrastructure  and 
social  expenditures. 

In  addition  to  the  sale  of  state  companies,  the  government 
also  undertook  a  major  overhaul  of  its  Byzantine  financial  and 


xl 


regulatory  systems.  The  Salinas  administration  oversaw  the 
privatization  of  the  domestic  commercial  banks  and  the  pas- 
sage of  a  new  national  Law  of  Banking  and  Credit  that  thor- 
oughly modernized  domestic  banking.  Opportunities  for 
foreign  investment,  which  had  been  severely  restricted  since 
the  Revolution,  were  expanded  considerably  under  the  1993 
Foreign  Investment  Law.  For  the  first  time  since  the  Revolu- 
tion, foreigners  were  allowed  to  own  commercial  and  residen- 
tial property  directly,  rather  than  through  a  Mexican 
intermediary.  New  commercial  and  securities  market  regula- 
tions encouraged  a  massive  influx  of  foreign  direct  and  portfo- 
lio investment  during  the  early  1990s.  The  most  visible 
consequence  of  increased  foreign  investment  was  the  explosive 
growth  of  the  in-bond  (tariff  and  tax-free)  maquiladora  manu- 
facturing plants  along  the  Mexico-United  States  border.  Addi- 
tionally, after  1993  the  capitalization  of  the  Mexican  stock 
market  soared,  as  a  new  generation  of  foreign  (mainly  United 
States)  investors  sought  the  higher  returns  afforded  by  emerg- 
ing markets  such  as  Mexico's. 

The  dramatic  restructuring  and  austerity  measures  of  the 
Salinas  years  produced  a  positive  turnaround  in  Mexico's  mac- 
roeconomic  performance,  although  they  did  not  produce  the 
sustained  high  growth  rates  which  many  had  hoped  for.  Annual 
inflation  fell  from  159  percent  in  1987  to  6.7  percent  during 
the  first  three  quarters  of  1994.  Concurrently,  the  average 
annual  economic  growth  rate  between  1988  and  1994  was  a 
modest  2.6  percent.  Unemployment  and  underemployment 
remained  high,  especially  in  the  countryside,  fueling  record 
levels  of  legal  and  illegal  migration  to  the  United  States.  More- 
over, the  new  prosperity  was  unevenly  distributed,  being  largely 
concentrated  in  the  north  and  among  a  minority  of  relatively 
well-educated,  urban  professionals  and  white-collar  workers. 

Perhaps  the  single  most  important  catalyst  for  the  transfor- 
mation of  Mexican  economic  policy  was  the  Salinas  administra- 
tion's ambitious  goal  of  participating  as  a  full  partner  in  the 
emerging  North  American  free-trade  zone  begun  by  Canada 
and  the  United  States  in  the  early  1990s.  President  Salinas  and 
his  advisers  viewed  Mexico's  integration  into  the  world  trading 
system  as  the  only  viable  basis  for  their  country's  future  long- 
term  growth.  Bowing  to  geographic  reality,  Salinas  discarded 
decades  of  protectionist  and  nationalistic  practices  by  past 
Mexican  governments  to  forge  a  close  and  lasting  economic 
and  political  partnership  with  the  United  States.  The  objective 


xli 


was  nothing  less  than  Mexico's  full  incorporation  into  the 
emerging  North  American  financial  and  trading  bloc.  In  1991 
Mexico  began  negotiations  with  Canada  and  the  United  States 
on  the  terms  of  a  trilateral  free-trade  treaty,  the  North  Ameri- 
can Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA). 

NAFTA  became  the  cornerstone  of  Mexico's  reform  efforts 
and  the  ultimate  test  of  its  recognition  as  a  new  entrant  in  the 
community  of  modern  nations.  In  preparation  for  Mexico's 
accession  to  NAFTA,  the  Salinas  administration  redoubled  its 
efforts  to  open  its  markets  and  to  increase  the  competitiveness 
of  its  domestic  economy.  Mexico  also  became  more  receptive 
to  United  States  concerns  on  a  range  of  bilateral  issues,  includ- 
ing narcotics  trafficking  and  illegal  immigration.  In  response 
to  international  pressure,  the  Mexican  government  improved 
its  human  rights  practices  and  made  the  electoral  process  more 
transparent.  In  the  weeks  preceding  the  vote  on  ratification  of 
NAFTA  by  the  United  States  Congress,  Mexico  and  the  United 
States  negotiated  a  series  of  side  agreements  on  environmental 
protection  that  helped  assure  the  entry  into  force  of  the  treaty 
on  January  1,  1994. 

The  ratification  of  NAFTA  boosted  international  confidence 
in  the  Mexican  economy,  spurring  an  influx  of  foreign  capital 
and  fueling  predictions  of  an  imminent  economic  boom. 
National  opinion  polls  showed  President  Salinas's  popularity  to 
be  at  an  all-time  high,  and  the  PRI  was  preparing  to  pass  the 
mantle  of  the  presidency  to  Salinas's  handpicked  successor, 
Luis  Donaldo  Colosio  Murrieta,  in  the  August  1994  presiden- 
tial election. 

The  triumphant  mood  in  Mexico  City  was  dashed  on  Janu- 
ary 1,  1994,  the  day  NAFTA  entered  into  force,  when  a  hereto- 
fore unknown  insurgent  group,  the  Zapatista  Army  of  National 
Liberation  (Ejercito  Zapatista  de  Liberacion  Nacional — 
EZLN),  briefly  took  over  four  municipalities  in  the  southern 
state  of  Chiapas.  The  Zapatistas,  as  members  of  the  EZLN  came 
to  be  known,  consisted  of  several  hundred  indigenous  people 
from  the  Chiapas  highlands  as  well  as  a  leadership  and  support 
network  of  white,  university-educated  Marxists  and  former 
guerrillas.  The  Zapatistas  justified  their  armed  movement  and 
their  violent  takeover  of  the  Chiapas  municipalities  as  gestures 
of  protest  against  the  market-oriented  economic  policies  of  the 
Salinas  administration,  including  NAFTA.  These  policies  were 
blamed  for  the  worsening  living  conditions  of  Mexico's  rural 
poor.  Additionally,  the  Zapatistas  decried  the  state's  historical 


xlii 


discrimination  and  neglect  of  Mexico's  indigenous  communi- 
ties and  the  authoritarian  practices  of  the  ruling  PRI.  The  Chi- 
apas rebellion  galvanized  the  Mexican  left  and  created  a 
heightened  awareness  of  the  difficult  circumstances  of  many  of 
Mexico's  indigenous  people.  It  also  provoked  a  strong  military 
reaction  and  shattered  the  image  of  stability  that  the  Salinas 
administration  had  tried  to  project  to  the  world. 

An  even  greater  setback  to  Mexico's  stability  occurred  on 
March  22,  1994,  when  PRI  presidential  candidate  Colosio  was 
assassinated  at  a  campaign  rally  in  the  northern  city  of  Tijuana. 
The  Colosio  murder  was  the  first  major  instance  of  political  vio- 
lence against  a  high-level  PRI  official  since  the  assassination  of 
President  Alvaro  Obregon  in  the  1920s.  Following  initial 
reports  that  a  lone  gunman  was  responsible  for  the  killing, 
additional  evidence  pointed  to  a  conspiracy  involving  at  least 
half  a  dozen  security  personnel  believed  to  be  linked  to  a  local 
drug  cartel. 

Colosio  was  replaced  on  the  PRI  presidential  ticket  by  his 
campaign  manager  and  former  education  secretary,  Ernesto 
Zedillo  Ponce  de  Leon.  The  PRI  once  again  faced  a  competi- 
tive election,  with  the  main  opposition  challenge  coming  this 
time  from  the  conservative  PAN.  Unlike  the  election  of  Salinas 
in  1988,  the  1994  presidential  election  was  judged  by  domestic 
and  international  observers  to  be  relatively  free  and  fair.  Dur- 
ing the  months  preceding  the  vote,  the  PRI  had  agreed  to  sev- 
eral major  reforms  of  the  electoral  process,  including  antifraud 
measures  such  as  transparent  ballot  boxes,  photo-identification 
cards  for  voters,  and  the  inclusion  of  a  larger  number  of  non- 
PRI  seats  in  the  National  Electoral  Commission.  Zedillo  won 
the  election  with  a  plurality  of  the  vote,  thus  extending  the 
PRI's  dubious  record  as  the  world's  longest-ruling  political 
party  (surpassing  even  the  Communist  Party  of  the  former 
Soviet  Union).  Although  Zedillo  was  elected  to  the  presidency 
by  a  slimmer  margin  than  Salinas,  the  results  of  what  was  prob- 
ably the  cleanest  presidential  election  in  modern  Mexican  his- 
tory were  accepted  as  legitimate  by  most  observers  and 
opposition  groups. 

The  salutary  effect  of  the  August  elections  was  not  destined 
to  endure,  however.  In  September,  another  high-level  PRI  offi- 
cial, Jose  Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu,  was  assassinated  on  a  Mexico 
City  street.  Widespread  speculation  that  an  interfactional  war 
was  taking  place  within  the  PRI  was  supported  by  evidence  link- 
ing a  fugitive  PRI  congressman  to  the  second  killing.  The  scan- 


xliii 


dal  broadened  shortly  after  the  Zedillo  administration  took 
office,  when  evidence  was  uncovered  linking  former  president 
Salinas's  brother,  Raul,  to  the  Ruiz  Massieu  murder. 

The  first  month  of  the  Zedillo  administration  coincided  with 
a  dramatic  financial  crisis  that  dealt  a  severe  setback  to 
Mexico's  economic  recovery  efforts.  The  crisis  was  rooted  in 
Mexico's  accumulation  of  a  dangerously  high  current-account 
deficit  throughout  1994.  To  finance  increased  government 
spending,  the  Mexican  government  had  floated  a  large  num- 
ber of  short-term,  high-yield  bonds  known  as  tesebonos.  As  the 
successive  political  shocks  of  1994  drove  capital  from  the  Mexi- 
can stock  and  bond  markets,  and  as  interest  rates  rose  in  the 
United  States,  the  Mexican  government  became  increasingly 
dependent  on  short-term,  high-yield  instruments  to  attract 
scarce  capital. 

Following  the  Ruiz  Massieu  assassination,  Mexican  investors 
withdrew  large  amounts  of  capital  from  the  Mexican  market. 
This  situation  made  it  impossible  for  the  government  to  pay 
dividends  on  a  series  of  tesebonos  that  were  scheduled  to  mature 
in  December.  Despite  its  untenable  financial  situation,  the  gov- 
ernment dismissed  the  possibility  of  a  devaluation  of  the  new 
peso  (for  value  of  the  new  peso — see  Glossary),  but  subse- 
quently reversed  itself  in  late  December.  The  devaluation  and 
the  disclosure  of  Mexico's  short-term  liquidity  crisis  set  off  a 
run  on  the  new  peso  and  caused  the  Mexican  stock  market  to 
lose  half  its  value.  The  crash  of  the  Mexican  stock  market  rever- 
berated throughout  Latin  America  and  other  developing  coun- 
tries. 

The  consequences  of  the  currency  crisis  in  Mexico  were 
severe.  Consumer  interest  rates  shot  up  to  an  average  of  80  per- 
cent, making  it  impossible  for  many  borrowers  to  pay  interest 
on  their  loans  or  to  make  credit-card  payments.  Mexico's 
expanding  commercial  sector  was  devastated,  as  thousands  of 
businesses  were  forced  into  bankruptcy  or  were  required  to  lay 
off  much  of  their  workforce.  The  devaluation  of  the  currency 
pushed  annual  inflation  from  6  percent  to  nearly  50  percent, 
imposing  a  severe  burden  on  consumers  and  pushing  millions 
of  people  below  the  poverty  line. 

In  January  1995,  the  United  States  provided  assistance  to 
Mexico  in  the  form  of  a  US$20  billion  emergency  debt  relief 
package.  The  concession  by  the  United  States  government  of 
an  emergency  loan  to  Mexico  was  highly  controversial  in  both 
countries.  To  assuage  congressional  opposition  to  the  loan 


xliv 


package,  the  administration  of  United  States  President  William 
J.  Clinton  took  the  unprecedented  step  of  requiring  the  Mexi- 
can government  to  commit  its  revenues  from  the  national  oil 
company  as  collateral. 

As  Mexico's  economy  stabilized  in  the  wake  of  the  financial 
crisis,  a  series  of  bizarre  political  events  unfolded  in  the  open- 
ing months  of  1995.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  financial  crisis,  a 
rare  public  feud  developed  between  former  president  Salinas 
and  the  Zedillo  administration,  with  each  side  blaming  the 
other  for  mishandling  the  crisis.  Hailed  as  a  modernizer  just  a 
few  months  before,  Salinas  had  become  the  main  target  of  pub- 
lic blame  for  the  near-collapse  of  the  financial  system.  Salinas's 
reputation  suffered  a  further  blow  in  connection  with  his 
brother  Raul's  reported  role  in  the  Jose  Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu 
assassination.  Shortly  after  being  cleared  as  a  suspect  by  the 
attorney  general's  office,  Salinas  quietly  left  Mexico  for  appar- 
ent exile  in  Ireland. 

Charges  of  high-level  corruption,  bribery,  and  the  role  of 
drug  money  in  the  assassination  of  government  officials  contin- 
ued to  grow.  Despite  convictions  for  the  1994  murder  of  PRI 
official  Jose  Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu,  the  motives  behind  the 
killing  remained  unanswered.  Questions  about  the  assassina- 
tion increased  when,  in  November  1994,  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu, 
Mexico's  assistant  attorney  general,  younger  brother  of  Jose 
Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu  and  the  official  in  charge  of  the  mur- 
der investigation,  abruptly  resigned,  claiming  that  high-rank- 
ing PRI  officials  were  thwarting  his  investigation  efforts.  When 
the  investigation  resumed  with  a  new  prosecutor  in  charge, 
Raul  Salinas  de  Gotari,  brother  of  the  former  president,  was 
arrested  and  charged  with  hiring  a  hit  man  to  murder  Jose 
Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu.  It  was  widely  assumed  that  pressure 
from  high  government  officials  to  ignore  Salinas's  involvement 
was  the  reason  for  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu's  resignation. 

On  March  2,  1995,  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu  was  arrested  at  New- 
ark International  Airport  before  boarding  a  plan  for  Spain  and 
charged  by  United  States  customs  officials  with  failing  to 
declare  US$46,000.  He  was  placed  under  house  arrest,  and  pro- 
ceedings for  deportation  began.  Investigations  of  Mario  Ruiz 
Massieu's  finances  revealed  a  US$9  million  bank  account  in 
Houston.  United  States  federal  prosecutors  charged  that  the 
money  had  come  from  Mexican  drug  traffickers,  and  a  civil 
trial  to  seize  the  money  began  in  February  1997.  Despite  claims 
from  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu  that  the  money  was  obtained  legally, 


xlv 


documents  and  witnesses  in  the  civil  trial  claimed  that  the 
money  had  come  from  payoffs  from  drug  traffickers  to  avoid 
prosecution.  The  case  began  to  be  called  the  "Mexican  Water- 
gate" as  the  Mexico  City  newspapers  El  Proceso  and  La  Jornada 
published  documents  from  the  trial  that  also  implicated 
former  president  Salinas  and  his  brother  Raul  in  drug  traffick- 
ing. Other  stories  implied  that  payoffs  from  drug  traffickers 
might  have  played  a  role  in  the  Jose  Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu 
killing  and  in  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu's  resignation  from  the  inves- 
tigation. 

As  the  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu  investigation  and  trial  continued, 
another  drug-related  scandal  broke.  On  February  18,  General 
Jesus  Gutierrez  Rebollo,  newly  appointed  head  of  the  National 
Institute  to  Combat  Drugs,  was  fired  and  arrested.  While 
Gutierrez  Rebollo  aggressively  prosecuted  several  Mexican 
drug  cartels  in  his  ten  weeks  in  office,  he  allegedly  protected 
the  Ciudad  Juarez  drug  cartel  leader,  Amado  Carillo  Fuentes. 
Known  as  the  "lord  of  the  skies,"  Carillo  Fuentes  used  a  fleet  of 
Boeing  747s  to  ferry  cocaine  from  Colombia  to  Mexico  and 
then  to  the  United  States.  The  revelations  of  bribery  and 
involvement  in  drug  trafficking  were  particularly  embarrassing 
to  the  Mexican  military,  long  considered  the  one  institution  in 
Mexico  largely  untouched  by  corruption.  That  assumption  was 
again  challenged  when,  in  March  1997,  Brigadier  General 
Alfredo  Navarro  Lara  was  arrested  and  accused  of  trafficking, 
bribery,  and  criminal  conspiracy  in  a  protection  scheme  involv- 
ing a  Tijuana-based  drug  cartel. 

In  an  effort  to  clean  up  the  scandal-ridden  National  Institute 
to  Combat  Drugs,  Attorney  General  Jorge  Madrazo  Cuellar 
named  Mariano  Federico  Herran  Salvatti  as  the  institute's  new 
head.  Herran  had  previously  served  as  the  top  prosecutor  in 
Mexico  City,  and  underwent  extensive  background  checks  and 
drug  and  lie  detector  tests  before  being  offered  the  position. 
All  employees  of  the  institute  were  given  drug  tests,  and,  in 
another  embarrassment,  the  attorney  general's  office  reported 
that  424  tested  positive,  about  half  of  those  for  cocaine  use.  In 
his  swearing  in,  Herran  reported  that  his  greatest  challenge 
would  be  "recovering  the  confidence  lost  and  damaged  by  cor- 
ruption, impunity,  and  the  irresponsible  actions  of  many  bad 
public  servants  over  many  years." 

The  scandals  surrounding  the  Colosio  and  Ruiz  Massieu 
assassinations  underscored  a  growing  problem  of  corruption  of 
Mexican  political  and  law  enforcement  institutions  and  coin- 


xlvi 


cided  with  a  surge  in  criminal  activity  in  much  of  the  country. 
By  the  mid-1990s,  local  drug  mafias  with  connections  to 
Colombian  drug  cartels  posed  a  serious  challenge  to  state 
authority  in  several  remote  areas  of  Mexico.  With  their  control 
over  enormous  sums  of  money,  manpower,  and  real  estate,  the 
cartels  were  able  to  evade  prosecution  through  a  combination 
of  innovation  and  outright  bribery  of  local  officials  and  law 
enforcement  agencies.  In  some  cases,  entire  local  and  state  law 
enforcement  agencies  had  been  effectively  neutralized 
through  the  payment  of  bribes  and  the  placement  of  local  drug 
cartel  informants  in  police  units.  These  measures  allowed  the 
cartels  to  establish  relatively  secure  transshipment  corridors  for 
United  States-bound  drugs.  Mexican  authorities  reported  that 
drug  traffickers  had  even  resorted  to  buying  and  retrofitting 
old  airliners  to  carry  cocaine  from  South  America  to  the 
Mexico-United  States  border  region. 

Organized  crime  not  only  represented  a  direct  challenge  to 
the  rule  of  law  but  also  was  indirectly  responsible  for  under- 
mining democratic  institutions.  Evidence  gathered  from  the 
Colosio  and  Ruiz  Massieu  murder  investigations  suggested  that 
the  drug  cartels  may  have  formed  alliances  with  some  of  the 
informal  political  networks  within  the  PRI.  Reports  in  the  Mex- 
ican media  of  corruption  by  public  officials  and  law  enforce- 
ment agencies  eroded  the  public's  confidence  in  Mexico's 
political  institutions  and  created  a  climate  of  severe  cynicism 
and  mistrust  of  all  politicians. 

The  erosion  of  public  confidence  in  government  agencies 
was  reinforced  by  the  apparent  inability  of  police  to  stem  a 
growing  tide  of  criminal  behavior  in  Mexico  City  and  other 
large  urban  areas.  By  the  mid-1990s,  the  problem  of  rising 
organized  and  common  crime — a  problem  that  Mexico  shared 
with  several  other  countries  undergoing  simultaneous  demo- 
cratic reform  and  economic  austerity — had  become  a  para- 
mount public  concern. 

Responding  to  domestic  and  international  pressure  to  fight 
crime  and  reduce  official  corruption,  during  the  first  weeks  of 
his  administration  President  Zedillo  outlined  a  plan  for  the 
overhaul  of  the  justice  system  and  the  professionalization  of 
police  agencies.  To  demonstrate  his  resolve  to  solve  the  1994 
assassination  cases,  Zedillo  took  the  unusual  step  of  appointing 
as  attorney  general  a  well-respected  member  of  the  opposition 
PAN. 


xlvii 


President  Zedillo's  reform  efforts  were  derailed  by  the  finan- 
cial crisis  and  by  the  continuation  of  guerrilla  activity  in  Chia- 
pas and,  subsequently,  in  the  states  of  Guerrero  and  Oaxaca.  In 
April  1995,  Zedillo  ordered  a  major  military  offensive  against 
the  Zapatistas  and  their  urban  command  structure.  The  opera- 
tion managed  to  disrupt  the  Zapatistas'  urban  support  network, 
but  failed  to  capture  the  guerrillas'  eccentric  field  commander 
and  spokesman,  Subcommander  Marcos. 

The  government's  war  against  narcotrafficking,  as  well  as  its 
counterinsurgency  efforts  in  Chiapas  and  Guerrero,  raised  the 
military's  profile  in  Mexico's  civilian-dominated  political  sys- 
tem. The  military,  whose  role  since  the  1940s  has  been  largely 
confined  to  civic  action  and  disaster-relief  activities,  despite 
some  instances  of  corruption,  was  increasingly  being  called 
upon  to  replace  unreliable  police  agencies  in  the  interdiction 
of  narcotics  shipments.  The  army's  indefinite  deployment  in 
Chiapas  and  Guerrero,  which  also  represented  a  significant 
expansion  of  its  mission,  prompted  some  observers  to  warn  of 
a  growing  political  role  for  the  military  in  the  Mexican  political 
system. 

By  early  1997,  the  Mexican  economy  had  stabilized  and  the 
political  system  was  continuing  its  gradual  transition  toward 
increased  representativeness  and  responsiveness.  Throughout 
1996  the  opposition  PAN  won  a  number  of  important  munici- 
pal and  gubernatorial  elections.  The  left  did  not  fare  as  well  as 
the  right,  having  failed  to  regain  the  momentum  it  had 
acquired  during  the  late  1980s.  The  opposition  victories  in 
1996  set  the  stage  for  strong  challenges  to  the  PRI  in  the  1997 
midterm  congressional  elections,  the  first  balloting  for  the  key 
post  of  mayor  of  Mexico  City  in  the  summer  of  1997,  and  the 
2000  presidential  race. 

In  the  medium  term,  Mexico  faces  the  continuing  challenge 
of  carrying  through  its  political  and  economic  reforms  in  the 
face  of  further  potential  setbacks.  A  major  challenge  facing 
Mexico  is  that  of  restoring  healthy  economic  growth  and 
improving  domestic  productivity  and  national  competitiveness 
in  global  markets.  Mexico's  participation  in  NAFTA  provides 
strong  incentives  and  opportunities  to  increase  the  competi- 
tiveness of  the  Mexican  economy.  One  of  the  key  problems  will 
be  to  continue  opening  the  economy  while  minimizing  the 
potentially  destabilizing  human  costs  of  economic  dislocation, 
particularly  of  rural  communities  that  have  been  threatened  in 
the  short  run  by  freer  trade. 


xlviii 


Another  key  problem  facing  Mexico  into  the  twenty-first  cen- 
tury will  be  that  of  promoting  balanced  development  among 
the  country's  diverse  regions.  Data  from  the  1990  national  cen- 
sus show  a  declining  but  still  significant  gap  in  basic  quality-of- 
life  and  educational  indicators  between  the  relatively  prosper- 
ous north  and  the  less  developed  south  and  southwest.  Once 
sustained  growth  is  restored,  Mexico  will  be  challenged  to  over- 
come the  wide  regional  disparities  that  threaten  to  create,  in 
effect,  two  Mexicos. 

Finally,  Mexico  appears  to  be  undergoing  a  fundamental 
transformation  of  its  political  culture.  The  corporatist  patterns 
of  political  participation  that  were  promoted  by  the  PRI  during 
its  sixty-year  period  of  undisputed  rule  are  being  replaced  by 
more  liberal  forms  of  civic  association.  Recent  electoral 
reforms  and  opposition  victories  at  the  state  and  local  levels 
suggest  that  Mexico  is  in  transition  from  a  one-party  authoritar- 
ian system  to  a  multiparty  democracy.  During  the  first  half  of 
his  term,  President  Zedillo  took  significant  steps  to  weaken  the 
historically  strong  link  between  the  PRI  and  the  state.  The 
reform  process  is  threatened,  however,  by  the  growing  problem 
of  crime  and  the  penetration  of  the  state  by  criminal  organiza- 
tions. One  of  the  principal  political  challenges  facing  President 
Zedillo  and  his  successors  will  be  that  of  fashioning  a  robust 
response  to  crime  that  does  not  resort  to  authoritarian  meth- 
ods that  could  reverse  the  reform  process.

The  conquest  of  Tenochtitldn,  adapted  from  two  paintings  by  Diego  Rivera 


MEXICO'S  MANY  ARCHAEOLOGICAL  treasures,  its  architec- 
tural wealth,  and  its  diverse  population  provide  physical  clues 
to  a  past  that  has  given  rise  to  stories  of  migration,  settlement, 
conquest,  and  nation-building.  The  cultural  heritage  of  the 
Aztec,  the  Maya,  and  other  advanced  civilizations,  seen  in  the 
ruins  of  their  temples  and  in  their  artifacts,  bears  witness  to  the 
achievements  of  the  early  inhabitants  of  Mesoamerica  (see 
Glossary).  Following  a  pattern  that  spans  the  pre-Columbian 
era  to  modern  times,  new  civilizations  have  been  built  on  the 
ruins  of  the  old.  In  this  ongoing  process  of  cultural  superimpo- 
sition,  many  elements  of  the  past  have  endured,  despite  occa- 
sional efforts  to  root  out  traditional  practices  and  native 
identities.  A  major  change  came  with  the  Spanish  conquest. 
The  conquest  caused  a  traumatic  break  in  the  ebb  and  flow  of 
native  kingdoms  and  led  to  a  single,  albeit  stratified,  society 
that  was  neither  wholly  native  nor  European,  but  mestizo. 

The  conquistadors  unified  the  populations  of  the  former 
Mesoamerican  kingdoms  under  the  rule  of  a  militaristic  and 
theocratic  Spanish  monarchy.  After  early  attempts  by  the  con- 
querors and  their  descendants  to  establish  a  decentralized  feu- 
dal society,  central  aristocratic  authority  prevailed.  Throughout 
the  colonial  period,  a  distinctly  "Mexican"  national  identity  was 
emerging  among  the  mestizo  and  Creole  inhabitants  of  New 
Spain.  By  the  early  nineteenth  century,  Spain's  mercantilist 
trade  policies  and  its  discrimination  against  native-born  Mexi- 
cans in  colonial  business  and  administrative  affairs  fostered 
widespread  resentment  and  a  desire  for  greater  autonomy.  The 
geopolitical  crisis  of  the  Napoleonic  wars  and  the  influence  of 
Enlightenment  ideas  provoked  a  sudden  break  with  Madrid  in 
1810. 

In  the  aftermath  of  independence,  Mexico  suffered  a  pro- 
longed tumultuous  period  of  factionalism  and  foreign  inter- 
vention. Riven  by  bitter  disputes  between  conservatives  and 
liberals  and  governed  by  a  series  of  military  strongmen,  the 
country  languished  in  political  turmoil  while  it  lost  half  of  its 
territory  to  an  expanding  United  States.  Stability,  when  it  was 
finally  achieved  at  the  close  of  the  nineteenth  century,  was 
imposed  by  the  modernizing  but  politically  repressive  regime 
of  Jose  de  la  Cruz  Porfirio  Diaz.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Throughout  most  of  the  nineteenth  century,  Mexico's  popu- 
lation was  denied  opportunities  for  individual  prosperity  and 
fair  and  equal  treatment  before  the  law.  In  a  country  that 
remained  predominantly  rural  until  the  1950s,  landlessness 
and  rural  unemployment  had  become  endemic.  The  suppres- 
sion of  civil  liberties  and  the  excessive  concentration  of  wealth 
during  the  Porfiriato  (the  name  given  to  the  years  of  the  Por- 
firio  Diaz  dictatorship,  1876-1910)  polarized  Mexican  society 
and  eventually  led  to  the  bitter  and  destructive  factional  wars 
collectively  known  as  the  Mexican  Revolution.  After  nearly  a 
decade  of  devastating  warfare,  the  combatants  came  together 
in  the  town  of  Queretaro  in  1917  to  draft  a  grand  compromise 
that  would  incorporate  the  ideals  of  the  diverse  revolutionary 
factions. 

The  constitution  of  1917  gave  Mexicans  the  legal  and  ideo- 
logical framework  on  which  to  base  national  development: 
equality  before  the  law,  national  self-determination,  and  a  state- 
mediated  balance  between  private  property  rights  and  social 
welfare  objectives.  In  the  decades  that  followed,  different  Mexi- 
can administrations  would  alternatively  promote  redistribution 
or  economic  growth,  depending  on  a  variety  of  circumstances. 

By  the  late  twentieth  century,  the  burgeoning  Mexican  state 
could  no  longer  assure  the  Revolution's  promise  of  growth  with 
equity.  After  decades  of  semiauthoritarian  rule  by  the  domi- 
nant Institutional  Revolutionary  Party  (Parti do  Revolucionario 
Institucional — PRI),  corruption  and  excessive  clientelism  had 
overshadowed  the  ideal  of  equality  before  the  law.  Poverty, 
although  lessened,  continued  to  beset  half  of  the  population. 
The  debt  crisis  of  the  early  1980s  marked  the  end  of  Mexico's 
protectionist,  state-centered  economic  model  and  set  the  stage 
for  far-reaching  trade  and  financial  liberalization  and  system- 
atic privatization  of  key  industries.  By  the  early  1990s,  Mexico's 
economy  was  thoroughly  integrated  into  the  global  market, 
and  a  renascent  civil  society  was  exercising  increasing  auton- 
omy from  Mexico's  corporatist  political  institutions.  Mexico 
thus  approached  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century  in  a  state  of 
profound  transition  (see  fig.  1). 

Preconquest  Mexico 

Despite  Mexico's  rich  pre-Columbian  history,  following  the 
Spanish  conquest  in  1519,  the  country's  new  rulers  made  a 
concerted  attempt  to  erase  all  things  related  to  indigenous  cul- 
tures. Conquerors  and  missionaries  felt  divinely  inspired  to

Historical  Setting 


"civilize  and  evangelize"  the  native  peoples  of  the  New  World. 
The  attempts  to  Europeanize  and  Christianize  Mexico  led  to 
the  devaluation  of  much  of  the  indigenous  culture  for  the  next 
400  years. 

This  situation  was  finally  reversed  in  the  1920s  during  what 
has  become  known  as  the  cultural  phase  of  the  Revolution, 
when  a  conscious  effort  was  undertaken  to  search  for  a 
national  cultural  identity  known  as  mexicanidad  ("Mexican- 
ness").  The  search  for  this  new  national  consciousness  resulted 
in  a  renewed  appreciation  of  the  advanced  civilizations 
encountered  by  the  Spanish  in  1519.  Since  the  1920s,  extensive 
scholarship  has  been  devoted  to  native  Mexican  values  and  the 
cultural  expressions  of  those  indigenous  values  in  contempo- 
rary society. 

Ancient  Mexico 

The  first  humans  in  the  Americas  were  descendants  of 
northeast  Asian  nomads  who  took  part  in  a  series  of  migrations 
across  the  Bering  Strait  perhaps  as  early  as  30,000  B.C.  Archae- 
ological evidence  testifies  to  the  presence  of  early  hunters  and 
gatherers  in  Mexico  around  10,000  to  8000  B.C.  During  the 
next  few  thousand  years,  humans  domesticated  indigenous 
plants,  such  as  corn,  squash,  and  beans.  With  a  constant  food 
supply  assured,  people  became  permanent  settlers.  Leisure 
time  became  available  and  was  used  for  developing  technical 
and  cultural  skills.  Villages  appeared  as  the  number  of  people 
and  food  supplies  increased.  By  1500  B.C.,  the  early  inhabitants 
were  producing  handmade  clay  figurines  and  sophisticated 
clayware. 

Between  200  B.C.  and  A.D.  900,  Mesoamerica  was  the  scene 
of  highly  developed  civilizations.  Archaeologists  have  desig- 
nated this  Classic  Period  as  the  Golden  Age  of  Mexico.  This  era 
was  a  time  when  the  arts  and  sciences  reached  their  apex,  when 
a  writing  system  developed,  and  when  a  sophisticated  mathe- 
matical system  permitted  the  accurate  recording  of  time.  Reli- 
gion was  polytheistic,  revering  the  forces  of  nature  in  the  gods 
of  rain,  water,  the  sun,  and  the  moon.  The  most  important 
deity  was  Quetzalcoatl,  the  feathered  serpent  and  the  essence 
of  life,  from  whom  all  knowledge  derived.  Metals  came  into  use 
only  by  the  end  of  the  period,  but  despite  this  handicap, 
impressive  architectural  structures  in  the  pyramids  at  Teotihua- 
can  near  Mexico  City,  the  Pyramid  of  the  Niches  at  El  Tajin  in 


5 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

the  state  of  Veracruz,  and  the  Temple  of  the  Sun  at  Palenque  in 
present-day  Chiapas  were  built  and  survive  to  this  day. 

These  civilizations  produced  pottery,  statuary,  and  ornate 
buildings,  despite  their  being  supported  by  a  simple  agricul- 
tural economy  based  on  the  cultivation  of  a  few  staples.  Social 
stratification  produced  a  ruling  class  of  priests  and  intellectuals 
who  oversaw  the  labor  and  social  affairs  of  the  peasant  majority. 

The  three  most  important  Classic  sites  were  Teotihuacan  (in 
central  Mexico),  Monte  Alban  (to  the  south  in  the  state  of 
Oaxaca),  and  the  Mayan  complexes  (in  the  states  of  Chiapas, 
Tabasco,  Campeche,  Yucatan,  and  Quintana  Roo,  as  well  as  in 
the  nearby  countries  of  Honduras,  Guatemala,  and  Belize). 
The  fall  of  Teotihuacan  around  A.D.  650  effectively  transferred 
the  center  of  power  from  central  Mexico  to  the  Mayan  city 
states  of  the  Yucatan  Peninsula.  The  lowland  Mayan  culture 
flourished  from  A.D.  600  to  A.D.  900  when  it  abruptly 
declined.  The  exact  causes  of  this  rapid  fall  remain  unknown, 
but  archaeologists  speculate  that  it  might  have  been  because  of 
one  or  a  combination  of  factors:  bad  harvests,  plague,  drought, 
ecological  problems  from  overpopulation,  or  pressure  from 
more  warlike  neighbors.  Whatever  the  factors  may  have  been, 
they  provided  the  groundwork  for  the  next  phase,  the  Post- 
Classic  period,  which  would  be  a  radical  change  from  the  Clas- 
sic. 

The  main  characteristic  of  the  Post-Classic  period  was  a  sud- 
den surge  of  militarism.  The  population  underwent  great  tur- 
moil and  numerous  migrations;  people  moved  everywhere  and 
anywhere  they  could  find  allies  to  fight  their  common  enemies. 
Wars  ceased  to  be  waged  for  territorial  expansion  and  became 
a  means  for  exacting  tribute  and  for  capturing  prisoners  to  be 
sacrificed  to  the  gods.  For  the  first  time,  architecture  centered 
on  defense  and  fortification.  Numerous  civilizations  rose  and 
fell  during  this  period,  including  the  Toltec  in  central  Mexico 
and  the  Zapotec  and  Mixtec  in  southern  Mexico. 

The  Aztec 

Throughout  its  long  history  of  human  habitation,  the  Valley 
of  Mexico  drew  people  from  Mesoamerica  who  were  attracted 
by  its  abundant  sources  of  water,  easy  communication,  and 
plentiful  game  and  vegetation.  The  valley  was  a  corridor 
through  which  many  migrating  groups  passed  and  sometimes 
settled.  During  the  pre-Columbian  era,  the  valley  was  in  con-

stant  turmoil  except  when  central  authority  and  political  hege- 
mony existed. 

The  last  nomadic  arrivals  in  the  valley  were  the  Mexica, 
more  commonly  known  as  the  Aztec.  Although  recent  linguis- 
tic and  archaeological  work  suggests  the  Aztec  may  have  come 
from  northwest  Mexico,  their  origins  are  obscure.  According  to 
legend,  the  Aztec  came  from  Aztlan,  a  mythical  place  to  the 
north  of  the  Valley  of  Mexico  around  A.D.  1100.  They  were  said 
to  have  made  their  way  to  the  valley  guided  by  the  chirps  of 
their  sun  and  war  god  Huitzilopichtli  (meaning  "hummingbird 
on  the  left").  The  inhabitants  of  the  valley  viewed  the  new  arriv- 
als with  suspicion  and  tried  to  prevent  their  settlement.  After 
much  wandering  and  a  few  wars,  in  the  early  1300s,  the  Aztec 
reached  the  marshy  islands  in  Lago  de  Texcoco  (site  of 
present-day  Mexico  City),  wiiere  they  saw  an  eagle  perching  on 
a  cactus  tree  and  holding  a  snake  in  its  beak  (an  image  repro- 
duced on  the  modern  Mexican  flag).  According  to  Aztec  leg- 
end, this  was  a  sign  indicating  where  they  should  build  their 
new  capital  city.  Tenochtitlan  was  eventually  built  on  an  island 
in  Lago  de  Texcoco  and  gradually  became  an  important  center 
in  the  area.  Drinking  water  came  from  Chapultepec  hill  on  the 
mainland,  and  causeways  connected  the  island  to  the  shores  of 
the  lake.  The  Aztec  established  a  monarchy  in  1376,  naming 
Acamapichtli  as  their  first  king.  By  the  early  sixteenth  century, 
Aztec  domination  reached  into  most  of  central  and  southern 
Mexico  (with  the  exception  of  the  Mayan  areas  in  the  south- 
east) . 

Before  the  settlement  at  Tenochtitlan,  Aztec  society  was 
quite  simple  in  its  organization  and  was  composed  of  peasants, 
warriors,  and  priest-rulers.  Afterward,  and  with  a  much  larger 
population,  there  was  an  increasing  division  of  labor  and  a 
more  complex  social  structure.  The  emperor  was  selected 
according  to  merit  from  among  the  ruling  dynasty.  The  nobil- 
ity was  composed  of  the  high  priests,  the  military,  and  political 
leaders.  The  merchant  class  lived  apart  in  the  city  and  had  its 
own  courts,  guilds,  and  gods.  Commoners,  the  largest  segment 
of  society,  were  farmers,  artisans,  and  lower-level  civil  servants. 
The  lowest  rung  of  society  was  composed  of  conquered  peoples 
brought  to  Tenochtitlan  as  slaves. 

The  political  structure  of  the  Aztec  empire  was  based  on  a 
loose  coalition  of  city-states  under  the  fiscal  control  of  Tenoch- 
titlan. The  main  objective  of  Aztec  expansion  was  to  exact  trib- 
ute from  conquered  peoples.  Tributes  were  in  kind:  cocoa, 


8 


Historical  Setting 


cotton,  corn,  feathers,  precious  metals  and  stones,  shells,  and 
jaguar  skins  were  among  those  sent.  The  towns  also  had  the 
obligation  to  provide  soldiers  and  slaves  and  to  recognize  Aztec 
supremacy  and  the  supremacy  of  the  Aztec  god  Huitzilopichtli. 
Otherwise,  towns  were  basically  free  to  conduct  their  internal 
affairs,  and  Aztec  hegemony  was  never  fully  consolidated — a 
fact  that  eventually  became  a  major  element  in  the  fall  of  the 
empire. 

The  Spanish  Conquest 

Lured  by  stories  of  the  riches  of  the  Aztec,  a  Spanish  adven- 
turer, Hernan  (sometimes  referred  to  as  Fernando  or  Her- 
nando) Cortes,  assembled  a  fleet  of  eleven  ships,  ammunition, 
and  over  700  men  and  in  1519  set  sail  from  Cuba  to  Mexico. 
The  party  landed  near  present-day  Veracruz  in  eastern  Mexico 
and  started  its  march  inland.  Superior  firepower,  resentment 
against  the  Aztec  by  conquered  tribes  in  eastern  Mexico,  and 
considerable  luck  all  aided  the  Spanish  in  their  conquest  of  the 
Aztec.  The  Aztec  and  their  allies  had  never  seen  horses  or  guns, 
the  Spanish  had  interpreters  who  could  speak  Spanish,  Maya, 
and  Nahuatl  (the  Aztec  language),  and  perhaps  what  was  most 
important,  Cortes  unwittingly  had  the  advantage  of  the  legend 
of  Quetzalcoatl,  in  which  the  Aztec  are  said  to  have  believed 
that  a  white  god  would  arrive  in  ships  from  the  east  in  1519  and 
destroy  the  native  civilizations. 

Unwilling  to  confront  the  mysterious  arrival  whom  he  con- 
sidered a  god,  the  Aztec  emperor,  Moctezuma  II  (anglicized  as 
Montezuma),  initially  welcomed  the  Spanish  party  to  the  capi- 
tal in  November  1519.  Montezuma  soon  was  arrested,  and  the 
Spanish  took  control  of  Tenochtitlan.  The  Aztec  chieftains 
staged  a  revolt,  however,  and  the  Spanish  were  forced  to  retreat 
to  the  east.  The  Spanish  recruited  new  troops  while  a  smallpox 
epidemic  raged  through  Tenochtitlan,  killing  much  of  the  pop- 
ulation, possibly  including  Montezuma.  By  the  summer  of 
1521,  the  Spanish  were  ready  to  assault  the  city.  The  battle 
raged  for  three  weeks,  with  the  superior  firepower  of  the  Span- 
ish eventually  proving  decisive.  The  last  emperor,  Cuauhtemoc, 
was  captured  and  killed.  In  the  nineteenth  century,  the  legend 
of  Cuauhtemoc  would  be  revived,  and  the  last  Aztec  emperor 
would  be  considered  a  symbol  of  honor  and  courage,  the  first 
Mexican  national  hero.

New  Spain 

After  the  fall  of  Tenochtitlan,  the  Spaniards'  task  was  to  settle 
and  expand  the  new  domains  on  the  mainland  of  North  and 
Central  America  that  became  known  as  New  Spain.  Cortes  dis- 
patched several  expeditions  to  survey  the  areas  beyond  the  Val- 
ley of  Mexico  and  to  establish  political  control  over  the  land 
and  its  inhabitants.  Once  released  from  the  central  political 
control  of  Tenochtitlan,  most  towns  surrendered  to  Cortes's 
men.  As  a  symbol  of  political  continuity,  the  capital  of  the  new 
colony  was  to  be  built  squarely  atop  the  ruins  of  Tenochtitlan 
and  was  renamed  Mexico  after  the  Mexica  tribe. 

Encomiendas 

The  conquest  of  the  Aztec  empire  required  an  enormous 
effort  and  a  tremendous  sacrifice  by  Cortes's  army,  and  after 
their  victory,  the  soldiers  demanded  what  they  had  come  for: 
prestige  and  wealth.  The  spoils  from  the  city  largely  had  been 
lost;  Cortes  had  to  resort  to  some  other  strategy  to  provide  for 
his  men.  The  conquistador  had  already  surveyed  all  Aztec 
records  related  to  tributes  and  tributary  towns,  and  on  the  basis 
of  this  information,  he  decided  to  distribute  grants  of  people 
and  land  among  his  men.  This  practice  had  already  been  tried 
in  the  Caribbean,  and  Cortes  himself  had  received  encomiendas, 
grants  of  land  and  people,  in  Hispaniola  in  1509  and  in  Cuba 
in  1511.  Granting  encomiendas  became  an  institution  through- 
out New  Spain  to  ensure  subordination  of  the  conquered  pop- 
ulations and  the  use  of  their  labor  by  the  Spanish  colonizers,  as 
well  as  a  means  to  reward  Spanish  subjects  for  services  ren- 
dered to  the  crown. 

The  encomienda  was  a  Spanish  institution  of  Roman  origin, 
and  in  the  New  World,  the  Spanish  government  established  a 
series  of  rights  and  obligations  between  the  encomendero 
(grantee)  and  the  people  under  his  care.  The  indigenous  peo- 
ple were  required  to  provide  tribute  and  free  labor  to  the 
encomendero,  who  was  responsible  for  their  welfare,  their  assimi- 
lation into  Spanish  culture,  and  their  Christianization.  Political 
and  social  stratification  among  the  encomenderos  was  easily 
achieved  by  the  simple  fact  that  there  were  communities  of  dif- 
ferent sizes.  The  larger  the  grant,  the  larger  the  amount  of  trib- 
ute and  labor  available,  and  thus  the  greater  the  potential 
wealth  and  prestige  of  the  assignment.  In  reality,  the  native 
population  was  accustomed  to  a  similar  organization  of  tribu- 


10 


Historical  Setting 


tary  towns  under  the  Aztec.  In  time,  the  encomenderos  became 
the  New  World  version  of  Spanish  feudal  lords.  This  new 
source  of  political  power  came  to  worry  the  Spanish  authorities 
because  of  the  dangers  of  a  local  nobility  capable  of  contend- 
ing peninsular  authority. 

Although  disease  and  hardship  decimated  the  indigenous 
population,  increasing  numbers  of  Spaniards  arrived  with  great 
expectations  of  new  wealth.  Along  with  this  flow  of  Europeans 
came  the  African  slaves,  who  were  directed  to  the  central  areas 
of  New  Spain.  In  1549  the  Spanish  government  ended  yearlong 
labor  obligations,  as  well  as  payment  of  tribute.  To  compensate 
for  this  loss,  the  crown  instituted  a  new  system  of  forced  labor 
allotments  (repartimientos)  of  forty-five  days  a  year,  for  which 
every  person  was  to  be  paid  in  wages.  The  repartimiento  became 
a  source  of  abuse  by  employers  who  would  pay  wages  in 
advance  and  then  obligate  workers  indefinitely  as  repayment. 

In  the  late  seventeenth  and  early  eighteenth  centuries,  royal 
control  of  the  granting  of  encomiendas  became  more  strict.  On 
November  13,  1717,  a  royal  decree  abolished  encomiendas,  an 
act  that  was  confirmed  by  other  decrees  in  1720  and  1721. 
However,  in  the  most  remote  areas,  encomiendas  were  often  kept 
throughout  the  colonial  period  in  complete  defiance  of  the 
royal  decree  in  order  to  populate  these  regions. 

Colonial  Administration 

The  first  royal  judicial  body  established  in  New  Spain  in  1527 
was  the  audiencia  of  Mexico  City.  The  audiencia  consisted  of 
four  judges,  who  also  held  executive  and  legislative  powers. 
The  crown,  however,  was  aware  of  the  need  to  create  a  post  that 
would  carry  the  weight  of  royal  authority  beyond  local  alle- 
giances. In  1535  control  of  the  bureaucracy  was  handed  over  to 
Antonio  de  Mendoza,  who  was  named  the  first  viceroy  of  New 
Spain  (1535-50).  His  duties  were  extensive  but  excluded  judi- 
cial matters  entrusted  to  the  audiencia. 

Viceregal  power  was  characterized  by  a  certain  amount  of 
independence  from  royal  control,  mainly  because  of  distance 
and  difficult  communications  with  the  mother  country.  Vice- 
roys were  notorious  for  applying  orders  with  discretion,  using 
the  maxim  "I  obey  but  do  not  comply."  In  addition,  viceroys 
and  audiencias  were  in  conflict  most  of  the  time,  with  the  latter 
not  responsible  to  the  viceroy  but  reporting  directly  to  the 
crown.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

By  the  end  of  the  seventeenth  century,  the  Viceroyalty  of 
New  Spain  reached  from  New  Mexico  to  Panama  and  included 
the  Caribbean  islands  and  the  Philippines.  In  the  most  distant 
areas,  local  audiencias  enjoyed  greater  autonomy,  and  viceregal 
authority  was  merely  nominal.  After  the  sixteenth-century 
expansion  of  power,  the  seventeenth  century  was  marked  by  a 
decline  in  central  authority,  even  though  the  administrative 
structure  transplanted  to  the  New  World  remained  intact. 

Socioeconomic  Structures 

The  philosophy  of  mercantilism  was  the  force  behind  all 
overseas  ventures  by  European  colonial  powers.  This  set  of 
ideas  emphasized  that  the  most  important  function  of  colonial 
possessions  was  to  enrich  the  mother  country.  This  accumula- 
tion of  wealth  was  largely  accomplished  by  the  levy  of  the  quinto 
(royal  fifth)  on  all  colonial  production.  Trade  duties  protected 
manufacturers  and  merchants  in  Spain  from  competition  in 
the  colonies  and  placed  strict  restrictions  on  the  colonial  econ- 
omies. Mexico  was  required  to  supply  raw  materials  to  Spain, 
which  would  then  produce  finished  goods  to  be  sold  at  a  profit 
to  the  colonies. 

From  the  mid-sixteenth  century  on,  some  land  grants  were 
provided  to  Europeans  willing  to  farm  the  land  and  raise  live- 
stock in  underpopulated  areas.  The  European  acquisition  of 
land  often  encroached  upon  native  villages.  Displacement  and 
fear  of  forced  labor  in  the  early  seventeenth  century  led  entire 
villages  to  flee  to  larger  towns,  mining  camps,  or  haciendas, 
where  the  displaced  persons  hired  themselves  out  as  artisans, 
servants,  peons,  or  laborers.  Although  originally  kept  apart  in 
separate  "republics,"  close  contact  of  all  sorts  with  the  Span- 
iards was  responsible  for  the  indigenous  peoples'  accultura- 
tion. The  mestizos,  who  would  later  play  the  dominant  role  in 
Mexican  society  and  history,  could  trace  their  origins  to  this 
period  of  intense  assimilation  of  the  two  cultures  (see  Ethnicity 
and  Language,  ch.  2). 

Agricultural  production  was  directed  to  internal  markets, 
while  exports  consisted  mainly  of  precious  metals  and  animal 
hides.  During  the  initial  phase  of  the  colonial  period,  gold  had 
been  collected  from  the  Aztec  treasures  and  from  some  mining 
operations.  However,  silver  soon  became  the  dominant  colo- 
nial product,  followed  by  the  red  dye  cochineal,  and  by  the  late 
sixteenth  century,  silver  accounted  for  80  percent  of  all  exports 
from  New  Spain.  Exploration  and  the  search  for  mines  led  the 


12

Spaniards  to  the  north,  far  beyond  the  Aztec  empire.  The  rich 
mines  of  Zacatecas,  Real  del  Monte,  Pachuca,  and  Guanajuato 
in  north-central  Mexico  were  discovered  between  1546  and 
1552.  Silver  production  continued  into  the  seventeenth  cen- 
tury, and  it  employed  most  available  labor. 

During  the  sixteenth  century,  a  dual  economy  developed  in 
New  Spain:  the  hacienda  economy  in  the  Valley  of  Mexico  and 
the  south  and  the  frontier  economy  of  the  silver  mines  to  the 
north.  By  the  mid-seventeenth  century,  however,  silver  produc- 
tion collapsed  when  mercury,  necessary  to  the  refining  process, 
was  diverted  to  the  silver  mines  of  Potosi  (in  present-day 
Bolivia).  The  seventeenth-century  mining  crisis  led  to  wide- 
spread bankruptcy  among  miners  and  hacendados  (hacienda 
owners)  and  also  had  a  negative  effect  on  transatlantic  trade. 
However,  the  financial  crisis  did  promote  the  production  of 
crude  manufactures  and  food  for  domestic  consumption  by 
the  growing  population  of  New  Spain. 

Colonial  society  was  stratified  by  race  and  wealth  although 
these  were  not  hard  and  fast  distinctions.  The  three  main 
groups  were  whites  (European-  and  American-born),  castas 
(mestizos),  and  native  peoples;  each  had  specific  rights  or  priv- 
ileges (fueros)  and  obligations  in  colonial  society.  The  major 
fuero  was  the  right  of  an  individual  to  be  tried  by  his  or  her 
peers.  The  church,  the  military,  the  bureaucracy,  and  the  mer- 
chants enjoyed  their  set  of  fueros.  Membership  in  the  upper 
classes  was  open  to  whites  only,  particularly  peninsulares,  whites 
who  were  born  in  Spain  and  moved  to  the  colonies.  Criollos 
(American-born  whites,  also  known  as  Creoles)  tended  to 
marry  peninsulares  for  reasons  of  upward  social  mobility.  Never- 
theless, many  examples  exist  of  race  changes  after  birth. 

The  lower  classes  were  a  mixture  of  poor  whites,  castas,  and 
native  peoples  who  worked  in  the  same  occupations  as  whites 
or  castas  but  who  had  different  rights  and  obligations.  Indige- 
nous groups  were  protected  from  the  Inquisition  (the  Roman 
Catholic  court  designed  to  combat  heresy),  paid  head  taxes, 
and  could  not  own  property  as  individuals  but  were  the  pri- 
mary beneficiaries  of  social  services  in  health  and  education. 
Mestizos  were  under  the  same  obligations  as  whites  but  were 
not  considered  for  most  of  the  jobs  in  the  Spanish  administra- 
tion. These  jobs  were  held  only  by  peninsulares.  Poor  whites  and 
mestizos  often  competed  with  native  people  for  the  same  jobs. 
The  only  unifying  force  in  a  society  that  was  divided  by  race 
and  privilege  was  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  The  clergy  pro- 


13

vided  education  and  social  services  to  the  rich  and  the  destitute 
alike,  and  clergy  also  functioned  as  a  buffer  in  social  conflicts. 

The  Road  to  Independence 

The  beginning  of  the  eighteenth  century  in  Spain  coincided 
with  the  crowning  of  Spain's  first  Bourbon  king.  Under  the 
Habsburgs,  Spain  had  been  ruined  by  wars  abroad  and  con- 
flicts at  home.  The  new  Bourbon  administration  that  assumed 
power  in  1707  was  determined  to  effect  structural  changes  in 
Spain's  government  and  the  economy  to  centralize  power  in 
the  monarch.  The  colonies  also  received  increased  attention, 
mainly  in  terms  of  their  defense  and  the  reorganization  of 
their  economies. 

The  Bourbon  Reforms 

During  the  reign  of  the  third  Bourbon  king  of  Spain, 
Charles  III  (1759-88),  the  Bourbons  introduced  important 
reforms  at  home  and  in  the  colonies.  To  modernize  Mexico, 
higher  taxes  and  more  direct  military  control  seemed  to  be 
necessary;  to  effect  these  changes,  the  government  reorga- 
nized the  political  structure  of  New  Spain  into  twelve  intenden- 
cias,  each  headed  by  an  intendente  under  a  single  commandant 
general  in  Mexico  City,  who  was  independent  of  the  viceroy 
and  reported  directly  to  the  king. 

The  economic  reforms  were  directed  primarily  at  the  min- 
ing and  trade  sectors.  Miners  were  given  fueros  and  were 
allowed  to  organize  themselves  into  a  guild.  Commerce  was  lib- 
eralized by  allowing  most  Spanish  ports  to  trade  with  the  colo- 
nies, thus  destroying  the  old  monopoly  held  by  the  merchants 
of  the  Spanish  port  of  Cadiz. 

The  Bourbon  reforms  changed  the  character  of  New  Spain 
by  revising  governmental  and  economic  structures.  The 
reforms  also  prompted  renewed  migration  of  Spaniards  to  the 
colonies  to  occupy  newly  created  government  and  military 
positions.  At  the  same  time,  commerce,  both  legal  and  illegal, 
was  growing,  and  independent  merchants  were  also  welcomed. 
The  new  monied  classes  of  miners  and  merchants  were  the  real 
promoters  of  the  successes  of  the  reforms  enacted  by  the  Bour- 
bons.

Historical  Setting 


ation  in  the  1700s  gave  rise  to  greater  expectations  of  auton- 
omy by  the  colonists,  especially  after  the  republican  revolutions 
in  the  United  States  (1776),  France  (1789),  and  Haiti  (1804). 
Social  stratification  in  New  Spain,  marked  by  discrepancies 
between  the  rich  and  the  poor  and  between  criollos  and  penin- 
sulares,  however,  worked  to  prevent  the  necessary  social  cohe- 
sion for  a  revolutionary  undertaking,  even  though  the  tensions 
for  a  revolution  continued  to  build.  Peninsulares  from  all  walks 
of  life  believed  themselves  superior  to  their  American-born 
counterparts.  In  reaction  to  such  discrimination,  criollos 
showed  pride  in  things  that  pertained  to  Mexico.  Criollos  con- 
sidered themselves  subjects  of  the  Spanish  crown,  however,  and 
also  abided  by  the  doctrines  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church. 
More  important,  criollos  did  not  want  an  egalitarian  society — 
privileges  were  fine  as  long  as  they  benefited  from  them. 

In  Europe,  Napoleon  Bonaparte  invaded  the  Iberian  Penin- 
sula in  1808.  When  French  troops  entered  Madrid,  the  Habs- 
burg  king,  Charles  IV,  abdicated,  and  Napoleon  named  his 
brother  Joseph  Bonaparte  as  the  new  king.  Many  Spanish  patri- 
ots in  unoccupied  parts  of  Spain  declared  Ferdinand  VII,  son 
of  Charles  IV,  as  the  new  monarch.  When  the  news  of  Charles 
IV's  abdication  reached  New  Spain,  considerable  turmoil  arose 
over  the  question  of  whether  Ferdinand  VII  or  Joseph  was  the 
legitimate  ruler  of  the  colony.  Hoping  to  be  named  king  of  a 
newly  independent  country,  Viceroy  Jose  de  Iturrigaray  sup- 
ported the  criollos  of  New  Spain  when  they  proposed  a  junta  to 
govern  the  colony.  Peninsulares  realized  the  danger  of  such  an 
association  between  criollos  and  the  administration  and  thus 
orchestrated  a  coup  d'etat  in  1808  to  defend  their  privileges 
and  standing  in  colonial  society.  After  the  coup,  Iturrigaray  was 
replaced  by  a  senile  puppet  Spaniard,  Pedro  Garibay,  much  to 
the  despair  of  the  criollos. 

Wars  of  Independence,  1810-21 

The  eleven-year  period  of  civil  war  that  marked  the  Mexican 
wars  of  independence  was  largely  a  byproduct  of  the  crisis  and 
breakdown  of  Spanish  royal  political  authority  throughout  the 
American  colonies.  A  successful  independence  movement  in 
the  United  States  had  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of  a  republi- 
can alternative  to  the  European  crown.  For  most  politically 
articulate  criollos,  however,  a  strong  cultural  affinity  with  the 
mother  country,  a  preference  for  stability  and  continuity,  and 
alienation  from  Mexico's  native  and  poor  mestizo  populations 


15 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

were  significant  disincentives  to  a  radical  break  with  the  estab- 
lished order.  Dissatisfaction  with  peninsular  administrative  prac- 
tices and  anti-criollo  discrimination  at  many  levels  of  the 
colonial  government  and  society  were  important  foci  of  discon- 
tent, but  beyond  small  pockets  of  radical  conspirators,  these 
grievances  had  not  yet  spawned  a  pronounced  wave  of  proinde- 
pendence  criollo  sentiment  at  the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth 
century. 

The  French  occupation  of  Spain  and  the  overthrow  of  the 
Iturrigaray  junta  created  a  vacuum  of  legitimacy,  as  it  was  no 
longer  clear  that  the  ad  hoc  peninsular  administration  repre- 
sented any  authority  or  interests  other  than  its  own.  A  revolt 
would  no  longer  necessarily  be  a  challenge  to  the  paternal 
crown  and  the  faith  that  it  ostensibly  defended,  but  would 
instead  shake  off  the  rule  of  the  increasingly  despised  gachu- 
pines,  as  the  peninsulares  were  derisively  called.  It  was  in  this  con- 
text that  a  radical  criollo  parish  priest,  Miguel  Hidalgo  y 
Costilla,  was  able  to  lead  the  first  truly  widespread  insurrection 
for  Mexican  independence. 

Hidalgo  and  Morelos 

Soon  after  being  named  parish  priest  in  the  small  town  of 
Dolores,  Hidalgo  began  to  promote  the  establishment  of  vari- 
ous small  manufacturing  concerns.  He  realized  the  need  for 
diversification  of  industrial  activities  in  an  area  that  had  the 
mines  of  Guanajuato  as  its  major  business.  At  the  same  time, 
during  his  seven  years  at  Dolores,  Hidalgo  promoted  discussion 
groups  at  his  house,  where  Indians,  mestizos,  criollos,  and 
peninsulares  were  welcomed.  The  themes  of  these  discussions 
were  current  events,  to  which  Hidalgo  added  his  own  input  of 
social  and  economic  concerns.  The  independence  movement 
was  born  out  of  these  informal  discussions  and  was  directed 
against  Spanish  domination  of  political  and  economic  life  in 
New  Spain.  December  8,  1810,  was  set  for  the  beginning  of  the 
uprising. 

The  plans  were  disclosed  to  the  central  government,  and  the 
conspirators  were  alerted  that  orders  had  been  sent  for  their 
arrest.  Pressed  by  this  new  development,  on  September  16, 
1810,  Hidalgo  decided  to  strike  out  for  independence  without 
delay  (this  date  is  celebrated  as  Mexico's  independence  day). 
The  church  bells  summoned  the  people,  and  Hidalgo  asked 
them  to  join  him  against  the  Spanish  government  and  the 
peninsulares  in  the  famous  Grito  de  Dolores  (Cry  of  Dolores): 


16 


Historical  Setting 


"Long  live  Our  Lady  of  Guadalupe!  Death  to  bad  government! 
Death  to  the  gachupinesl"  The  crowd  responded  enthusiasti- 
cally, and  soon  an  angry  mob  was  marching  toward  the 
regional  capital  of  Guanajuato.  The  miners  of  Guanajuato 
joined  with  the  native  workers  of  Dolores  in  the  massacre  of  all 
peninsulares  who  resisted  them,  including  the  local  intendente. 

From  Guanajuato,  the  independence  forces  marched  on  to 
Mexico  City  after  having  captured  Zacatecas,  San  Luis  Potosf, 
and  Valladolid.  On  October  30,  1810,  they  encountered  resis- 
tance at  Monte  de  las  Cruces  and,  despite  a  rebel  victory,  lost 
momentum  and  did  not  take  Mexico  City.  After  a  few  more  vic- 
tories, the  revolutionary  forces  moved  north  toward  Texas.  In 
March  of  the  following  year,  the  insurgents  were  ambushed 
and  taken  prisoner  in  Monclova  (in  the  present-day  state  of 
Coahuila).  Hidalgo  was  tried  as  a  priest  by  the  Holy  Office  of 
the  Inquisition  and  found  guilty  of  heresy  and  treason.  He  was 
later  condemned  to  death.  On  July  31,  1811,  Hidalgo  was  exe- 
cuted by  firing  squad.  His  body  was  mutilated,  and  his  head  was 
displayed  in  Guanajuato  as  a  warning  to  other  would-  be  insur- 
gents. 

After  the  death  of  Hidalgo,  Jose  Maria  Morelos  Pavon 
assumed  the  leadership  of  the  revolutionary  movement.  More- 
los took  charge  of  the  political  and  military  aspects  of  the 
insurrection  and  further  planned  a  strategic  move  to  encircle 
Mexico  City  and  to  cut  communications  to  the  coastal  areas.  In 
June  1813,  Morelos  convoked  a  national  congress  of  represen- 
tatives from  all  of  the  provinces,  which  met  at  Chilpancingo  in 
the  present-day  state  of  Guerrero  to  discuss  the  future  of 
Mexico  as  an  independent  nation.  The  major  points  included 
in  the  document  prepared  by  the  congress  were  popular  sover- 
eignty, universal  male  suffrage,  the  adoption  of  Roman  Cathol- 
icism as  the  official  religion,  abolition  of  slavery  and  forced 
labor,  an  end  to  government  monopolies,  and  an  end  to  corpo- 
ral punishment.  Despite  initial  successes  by  Morelos's  forces, 
however,  the  colonial  authorities  broke  the  siege  of  Mexico 
City  after  six  months,  captured  positions  in  the  surrounding 
areas,  and  finally  invaded  Chilpancingo.  In  1815  Morelos  was 
captured  and  met  the  same  fate  as  Hidalgo. 

From  1815  to  1821,  most  of  the  fighting  by  those  seeking 
independence  from  Spain  was  done  by  isolated  guerrilla 
bands.  Out  of  these  bands  rose  two  men,  Guadalupe  Victoria 
(whose  real  name  was  Manuel  Felix  Fernandez)  in  Puebla  and 
Vicente  Guerrero  in  Oaxaca,  both  of  whom  were  able  to  com- 


17 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

mand  allegiance  and  respect  from  their  followers.  The  Spanish 
viceroy,  however,  felt  the  situation  was  under  control  and 
issued  a  general  pardon  to  every  rebel  who  would  lay  down  his 
arms. 

After  ten  years  of  civil  war  and  the  death  of  two  of  its 
founders,  by  early  1820  the  independence  movement  was  stale- 
mated and  close  to  collapse.  The  rebels  faced  stiff  Spanish  mili- 
tary resistance  and  the  apathy  of  many  of  the  most  influential 
criollos.  The  violent  excesses  and  populist  zeal  of  Hidalgo's  and 
Morelos's  irregular  armies  had  reinforced  many  criollos'  fears 
of  race  and  class  warfare,  ensuring  their  grudging  acquies- 
cence to  conservative  Spanish  rule  until  a  less  bloody  path  to 
independence  could  be  found.  It  was  at  this  juncture  that  the 
machinations  of  a  conservative  military  caudillo  coinciding 
with  a  successful  liberal  rebellion  in  Spain,  made  possible  a  rad- 
ical realignment  of  the  proindependence  forces. 

Iturbide  and  the  Plan  of  Iguala 

In  what  was  supposed  to  be  the  final  government  campaign 
against  the  insurgents,  in  December  1820,  Viceroy  Juan  Ruiz  de 
Apodaca  sent  a  force  led  by  a  royalist  criollo  officer,  Augustin 
de  Iturbide,  to  defeat  Guerrero's  army  in  Oaxaca.  Iturbide,  a 
native  of  Valladolid,  had  gained  renown  for  the  zeal  with  which 
he  persecuted  Hidalgo's  and  Morelos's  rebels  during  the  early 
independence  struggle.  A  favorite  of  the  Mexican  church  hier- 
archy, Iturbide  was  the  personification  of  conservative  criollo 
values,  devoutly  religious,  and  committed  to  the  defense  of 
property  rights  and  social  privileges;  he  was  also  disgruntled  at 
his  lack  of  promotion  and  wealth. 

Iturbide's  assignment  to  the  Oaxaca  expedition  coincided 
with  a  successful  military  coup  in  Spain  against  the  new  monar- 
chy of  Ferdinand  VII.  The  coup  leaders,  who  had  been  assem- 
bled as  an  expeditionary  force  to  suppress  the  American 
independence  movements,  compelled  a  reluctant  Ferdinand 
to  sign  the  liberal  Spanish  constitution  of  1812.  When  news  of 
the  liberal  charter  reached  Mexico,  Iturbide  saw  in  it  both  a 
threat  to  the  status  quo  and  an  opportunity  for  the  criollos  to 
gain  control  of  Mexico.  Ironically,  independence  was  finally 
achieved  when  conservative  forces  in  the  colonies  chose  to  rise 
up  against  a  temporarily  liberal  regime  in  the  mother  country. 
After  an  initial  clash  with  Guerrero's  forces,  Iturbide  switched 
allegiances  and  invited  the  rebel  leader  to  meet  and  discuss 
principles  of  a  renewed  independence  struggle. 


18 


Historical  Setting 


While  stationed  in  the  town  of  Iguala,  Iturbide  proclaimed 
three  principles,  or  "guarantees,"  for  Mexican  independence 
from  Spain:  Mexico  would  be  an  independent  monarchy  gov- 
erned by  a  transplanted  King  Ferdinand  or  some  other  conser- 
vative European  prince,  criollos  and  peninsulares  would 
henceforth  enjoy  equal  rights  and  privileges,  and  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church  would  retain  its  privileges  and  religious 
monopoly.  After  convincing  his  troops  to  accept  the  principles, 
which  were  promulgated  on  February  24,  1821,  as  the  Plan  of 
Iguala,  Iturbide  persuaded  Guerrero  to  join  his  forces  in  sup- 
port of  the  new  conservative  manifestation  of  the  indepen- 
dence movement.  A  new  army,  the  Army  of  the  Three 
Guarantees,  was  then  placed  under  Iturbide's  command  to 
enforce  the  Plan  of  Iguala.  The  plan  was  so  broadly  based  that 
it  pleased  both  patriots  and  loyalists.  The  goal  of  independence 
and  the  protection  of  Roman  Catholicism  brought  together  all 
factions. 

Iturbide's  army  was  joined  by  rebel  forces  from  all  over 
Mexico.  When  the  rebels'  victory  became  certain,  the  viceroy 
resigned.  On  September  27,  1821,  representatives  of  the  Span- 
ish crown  and  Iturbide  signed  the  Treaty  of  Cordoba,  which 
recognized  Mexican  independence  under  the  terms  of  the 
Plan  of  Iguala.  Iturbide,  a  former  royalist  who  had  become  the 
paladin  for  Mexican  independence,  included  a  special  clause 
in  the  treaty  that  left  open  the  possibility  for  a  criollo  monarch 
to  be  appointed  by  a  Mexican  congress  if  no  suitable  member 
of  the  European  royalty  would  accept  the  Mexican  crown. 

Empire  and  Early  Republic,  1821-55 

The  Abortive  Empire,  1821-23 

According  to  the  Plan  of  Iguala,  a  provisional  government 
was  set  up  while  an  independent  congress  deliberated  on  the 
future  of  the  nation.  Congress  was  able  to  agree  on  two  major 
issues:  to  cut  the  size  of  the  Army  of  the  Three  Guarantees  and 
to  determine  the  eligibility  of  officials  for  the  planned  regency 
that  eventually  would  replace  the  provisional  government.  As 
congress  deliberated,  Iturbide  realized  that  power  was  slipping 
from  his  hands  and  decided  to  stage  a  dramatic  demonstration 
on  his  behalf.  On  the  evening  of  May  18,  1822,  his  troops  were 
ordered  to  march  through  Mexico  City  in  support  of  their 
commander.  The  demonstration  by  the  Army  of  the  Three 
Guarantees  was  joined  by  other  soldiers  and  by  the  populace  as

it  proceeded  toward  Iturbide's  residence.  "Long  live  Agustin  I, 
Emperor  of  Mexico!"  was  the  acclamation,  at  which  Iturbide 
pretended  surprise.  The  following  day,  congress  named  Itur- 
bide as  the  constitutional  emperor  of  Mexico.  The  arrange- 
ments for  the  coronation  were  pretentious  but  still  in  accord 
with  Iturbide's  understanding  of  the  Mexican  ethos.  Iturbide 
recalled  the  importance  of  the  monarchy  in  maintaining  stabil- 
ity and  control  during  the  colonial  period,  and  he  decided  to 
take  full  advantage  of  tradition. 

The  new  empire  faced  serious  economic  problems.  After  the 
wars,  the  public  coffers  were  empty,  and  the  bureaucracy  had 
grown.  Modest  tax  adjustments  were  tried,  but  the  results  were 
meager.  In  congress,  discontented  factions  sharply  criticized 
the  government,  and  Iturbide's  recourse  was  to  dissolve  the  leg- 
islative branch  and  to  have  all  opposition  delegates  arrested  in 
August  1822.  In  Veracruz,  the  commander  of  the  garrison, 
Antonio  Lopez  de  Santa  Anna  Perez  de  Lebron,  rose  against 
Iturbide  and  proclaimed  a  republic  on  December  1,  1822. 
Santa  Anna  was  quickly  joined  by  other  revolutionaries — 
including  a  disenchanted  Vicente  Guerrero,  Nicolas  Bravo, 
and  Guadalupe  Victoria.  Together,  they  drew  up  the  Plan  of 
Casa  Mata  on  February  1,  1823.  By  midmonth,  Iturbide,  realiz- 
ing the  failure  of  his  efforts,  abdicated  the  throne.  Rebel  forces 
encountered  no  opposition  when  they  arrived  in  Mexico  City. 
In  July  the  United  Provinces  of  Central  America  (consisting  of 
Spanish-speaking  Central  America  except  for  present-day  Pan- 
ama), which  had  been  forcibly  incorporated  into  the  empire  by 
Iturbide,  declared  their  independence.  (The  province  of  Chia- 
pas, belonging  to  the  Captaincy  General  of  Guatemala,  opted 
to  remain  a  part  of  Mexico.)  The  experience  of  an  empire  had 
failed,  and  the  idea  of  a  monarchical  system  for  Mexico  would 
be  dismissed  for  four  decades.  Iturbide's  excesses  had  worked 
to  the  benefit  of  the  republicans. 

The  Federalist  Republic,  1824-36 

After  the  fall  of  the  empire,  a  provisional  government  was 
installed  consisting  of  Bravo,  Victoria,  and  Pedro  Celestino 
Negrete.  Delegates  were  elected  to  the  Constitutional  Congress 
that  entered  into  session  on  November  27,  1823.  The  congress 
had  two  major  factions:  the  federalists,  who  feared  control 
from  a  conservative  Mexico  City  and  were  supported  by  liberal 
criollos  and  mestizos;  and  the  more  conservative  centralists, 
who  preferred  the  rule  of  tradition  and  drew  their  allegiance

from  the  clergy,  conservative  criollos,  the  landowners,  and  the 
military. 

Although  the  federalist  forces  largely  prevailed  in  writing  the 
new  constitution,  the  centralists  won  three  major  concessions. 
The  constitution  of  1824,  which  was  strongly  influenced  by  the 
United  States  constitution  and  Mexico's  legislative  relationship 
with  Spain  since  1810,  established  the  United  Mexican  States 
(Estados  Unidos  Mexicanos)  as  a  federal  republic  composed  of 
nineteen  states  and  four  territories  (see  Constitutional  History, 
ch.  4).  Power  was  distributed  among  executive,  legislative,  and 
judicial  branches  of  government.  Legislative  power  was  wielded 
by  the  Senate  and  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  while  executive 
power  was  exercised  by  a  president  and  a  vice  president  elected 
by  the  state  legislatures  for  four-year  terms.  In  spite  of  the  lib- 
eral outlook  of  the  constitution,  certain  traditional  privileges 
were  maintained:  Roman  Catholicism  remained  the  official 
religion,  the  fueroswere  retained  by  the  military  and  clergy,  and 
in  national  emergencies  the  president  could  exercise  unlim- 
ited powers. 

During  the  administration  of  Mexico's  first  president,  Gua- 
dalupe Victoria,  economic  conditions  worsened  as  government 
expenditures  soared  beyond  revenues.  Declining  economic 
conditions  convinced  the  criollos  that  there  was  more  behind 
the  economic  decline  than  bad  management  by  peninsulares. 
One  of  the  government's  major  burdens  was  the  assumption  of 
all  debts  contracted  during  the  late  colonial  period  and  the 
empire,  a  substantial  sum.  The  government's  ability  to  service 
the  debt  was  severely  constrained  by  the  costs  of  maintaining  a 
50,000-strong  standing  army  and  the  insufficiency  of  revenues 
generated  by  tariffs,  taxes,  and  government  monopolies.  To 
cover  the  shortfall,  Victoria  accepted  two  large  loans  on  stiff 
terms  from  British  merchant  houses.  The  British  had  sup- 
ported independence  movements  in  Spanish  colonies  and  saw 
the  loans  as  an  opportunity  to  further  displace  Spain  as  the 
New  World's  dominant  mercantile  power. 

Mexico's  financial  crisis  was  overshadowed  in  1827  by  a  con- 
servative rebellion  led  by  Vice  President  Bravo.  The  revolt  was 
quickly  suppressed  by  generals  Santa  Anna  and  Guerrero,  but 
political  tensions  remained  high  as  the  presidential  elections  of 
1828  approached.  The  September  1828  elections  pitted  Gene- 
ral Guerrero  as  the  liberal  candidate  for  the  federalists  against 
conservative  Manuel  Gomez  Pedraza,  who  had  served  as  secre- 
tary of  war  in  Victoria's  bipartisan  cabinet.  The  voting  results 


21 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

from  the  state  legislatures  showed  Gomez  Pedraza  to  be  the 
winner  in  ten  of  the  nineteen  states,  but  the  liberals  refused  to 
turn  over  the  government,  claiming  that  Gomez  Pedraza  had 
used  his  authority  over  the  army  to  pressure  the  states  into  vot- 
ing in  his  favor.  A  period  of  confusion  ensued  as  two  rival  gov- 
ernments and  their  respective  military  factions  battled  over  the 
presidential  succession.  The  liberals  finally  emerged  victorious 
after  Gomez  Pedraza  abandoned  the  presidential  palace  under 
sustained  pressure  from  rebels  commanded  by  Santa  Anna  and 
Lorenzo  de  Zavala. 

President  Guerrero  took  power  over  a  liberal  government 
shrouded  in  questionable  legality  and  dependent  upon  the  loy- 
alty of  the  military.  Immediately  upon  assuming  office,  Gue- 
rrero experienced  his  first  major  crisis  when  the  Spanish 
attempted  to  retake  Mexico.  A  Spanish  force  of  3,000  soldiers 
under  the  command  of  General  Isidro  Barradas  landed  at 
Tampico  in  July  1829.  Guerrero  sent  Santa  Anna  to  dislodge 
the  Spanish  force  in  August,  but  the  Mexican  general  could 
not  launch  an  effective  assault  and  instead  dug  in  for  a  siege. 
Cut  off  from  supplies  and  weakened  by  disease,  the  Spanish 
surrendered  to  the  Mexicans  in  October.  In  the  aftermath  of 
the  Spanish  withdrawal,  Santa  Anna  was  widely  hailed  as  the 
savior  of  the  republic. 

With  the  Spanish  threat  gone,  Guerrero  enacted  several  lib- 
eral reforms,  including  the  abolition  of  slavery  in  September 
1829.  His  forceful  style  of  governing,  made  possible  by  his 
retention  of  emergency  presidential  powers  obtained  during 
the  Spanish  invasion,  gave  the  conservatives  renewed  cause  to 
rebel.  In  early  1830,  the  conservative  vice  president,  Anastasio 
Bustamante,  led  a  successful  military-backed  revolt  against 
Guerrero  and  installed  himself  as  Mexico's  third  president. 
While  attempting  to  flee  the  country  in  January  1831,  Gue- 
rrero was  captured  and  executed  by  government  soldiers  on 
Bustamante's  orders.  Bustamante's  conservative  government 
was  highly  unpopular  and  repressive.  In  early  1832,  Santa  Anna 
denounced  Bustamante  in  Veracruz,  occupied  the  city,  and 
appropriated  its  custom  revenues.  Santa  Anna's  defiance 
spurred  additional  revolts  throughout  the  states,  leading  to  the 
eventual  collapse  of  the  conservative  government  and  the 
return  of  the  liberals. 

The  highly  popular  Santa  Anna  was  elected  president  under 
the  liberal  banner  in  early  1833.  Instead  of  assuming  office, 
however,  he  withdrew  into  semiretirement  and  delegated  the 


22 


Historical  Setting 


presidency  to  his  vice  president,  Valentin  Gomez  Farias.  The 
liberal  Gomez  Farias  government  was  strongly  reformist,  to  the 
detriment  of  traditional  church  and  military  privileges.  Among 
its  reforms,  the  new  administration  decreed  that  payment  of 
tithes  would  no  longer  be  compulsory,  and  it  transferred  to  the 
nation  the  right  to  make  ecclesiastical  appointments.  In  addi- 
tion, Gomez  Farias  reduced  the  size  of  the  army  and  elimi- 
nated its  fueros. 

Gomez  Farias's  far-reaching  reforms  drew  a  characteristically 
strong  response  from  conservative  elites,  the  army,  and  the 
church  hierarchy.  Under  the  banner  of  religion  y  fueros,  the  inev- 
itable conservative  backlash  gained  strength  throughout  the 
winter  of  1833.  In  April  1834,  Santa  Anna  abandoned  the  lib- 
eral cause  and  deposed  Gomez  Farias.  The  renowned  general 
promptly  dismissed  congress  and  assumed  dictatorial  powers, 
bringing  an  end  to  liberal  rule  under  the  federal  republic. 

Centralism  and  the  Caudillo  State,  1836-55 

In  the  two  decades  after  the  1834  collapse  of  the  federal 
republic,  Santa  Anna  dominated  Mexico's  politics.  Between 
1833  and  1855,  the  caudillo  occupied  the  presidency  eleven 
times,  completing  none  of  his  terms  and  frequently  leaving  the 
government  in  the  hands  of  weak  caretaker  administrations. 
During  this  period,  Mexico  went  to  war  on  three  separate  occa- 
sions and  lost  half  of  its  territory  through  sale  or  military 
defeat.  Fiscal  insufficiency  kept  Mexico  constantly  on  the  verge 
of  bankruptcy  and  foreign  military  intervention. 

Santa  Anna  repeatedly  rose  to  the  presidency,  only  to  be  cast 
out  in  the  wake  of  scandals  and  military  defeats.  Invariably,  he 
returned — even  from  exile — to  lead  the  republic  once  more 
into  military  glory  or  out  of  insolvency.  Santa  Anna's  bravery, 
energy,  and  organizational  abilities  were  often  matched  by  his 
vanity,  cruelty,  and  opportunism.  His  feats  of  heroism  in  victori- 
ous battle,  his  bold  interventions  in  the  political  life  of  the 
country,  and  his  countless  shifts  from  one  side  of  the  political 
spectrum  to  the  other  responded  to  the  insecurities  of  Mexican 
nationalists  and  the  vacillations  of  the  republic's  fractious  polit- 
ical class. 

The  Constitution  of  1836 

Upon  assuming  dictatorial  powers,  Santa  Anna  promptly 
annulled  Gomez  Farias's  reforms  and  abolished  the  constitu- 
tion of  1824.  The  authoritarian  principles  that  underlay  Santa 


23 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Anna's  rule  were  subsequently  codified  in  the  constitution  of 
1836,  also  known  as  the  Siete  Leyes  (Seven  Laws).  Under  the 
constitution  of  1836,  Mexico  became  a  centralist  regime  in 
which  power  was  concentrated  in  the  president  and  his  imme- 
diate subordinates.  The  states  of  the  former  federal  republic 
were  refashioned  as  military  districts  administered  by  regional 
caudillos  appointed  by  the  president,  and  property  qualifica- 
tions were  decreed  for  congressional  officeholders  and  voters. 

The  nationalist  and  authoritarian  style  of  the  new  centralist 
regime  soon  brought  it  into  conflict  with  the  loosely  governed 
lands  of  Mexico's  northern  frontier.  Santa  Anna's  efforts  to 
exert  central  authority  over  the  English-speaking  settlements  in 
the  northern  state  of  Coahuila-Tejas  eventually  collided  with 
the  growing  assertiveness  of  the  frontier  population  that 
described  itself  as  Texan. 

The  Loss  of  Texas 

Texas  (known  as  Tejas)  had  been  part  of  New  Spain  since 
the  early  colonial  period.  In  1821  in  an  effort  to  colonize  and 
populate  Texas,  the  Spanish  commander  in  Monterrey  granted 
a  concession  to  a  United  States  pioneer,  Moses  Austin,  to  settle 
the  area  under  the  Roman  Catholic  faith.  Land  could  be 
acquired  for  a  nominal  charge  of  US$0.25  per  hectare,  and 
soon  colonists  from  the  United  States  started  to  pour  into  the 
area.  By  1835  they  outnumbered  the  Mexicans,  four  to  one. 
Texas  had  no  autonomous  government  and  was  politically 
attached  to  the  state  of  Coahuila.  Most  Mexicans  began  to  fear 
the  incursions  by  North  Americans  and  the  possibility  of  losing 
Texas  to  the  United  States.  Restrictions  were  placed  on  the 
future  immigration  of  colonists  from  the  United  States,  and  sla- 
very was  abolished  in  1829  in  the  hope  of  discouraging  United 
States  southerners  from  moving  into  the  area. 

Santa  Anna's  move  to  bring  Texas  under  the  political  domi- 
nation of  Mexico  City  pushed  the  Texans  to  secede  from 
Mexico  on  November  7,  1835,  and  to  declare  their  indepen- 
dence in  March  1836.  In  1835  Santa  Anna  marched  north  in 
the  direction  of  San  Antonio  with  an  army  of  3,000  men.  He 
reached  San  Antonio  in  March  1836  and  learned  that  about 
150  armed  Texans  had  taken  refuge  at  an  old  Franciscan  mis- 
sion, called  the  Alamo.  He  laid  siege  to  the  mission  for  several 
days  before  the  final  attack  on  March  6,  1836.  The  Mexican 
force  took  the  mission  the  next  day,  killing  all  but  five  of  the 
defenders  in  battle  (the  five  prisoners  were  later  executed).  On 


24 


Historical  Setting 


March  23,  the  Texan  town  of  Goliad  was  surrounded  by  Mexi- 
can forces,  who  compelled  the  Texan  commander  in  charge  to 
surrender.  On  express  orders  from  Santa  Anna,  365  prisoners 
were  executed.  The  events  at  the  Alamo  and  at  Goliad  stirred 
strong  anti-Mexican  sentiment  in  the  United  States.  Volunteer 
fighters  poured  into  Texas  to  stage  a  decisive  blow  against 
Santa  Anna.  The  Mexican  commander  in  chief  and  his  army 
were  ambushed  and  roundly  defeated  near  the  San  Jacinto 
River  by  a  force  commanded  by  Sam  Houston  on  April  21. 
Santa  Anna,  who  had  fled  the  scene  of  the  battle,  was  captured 
by  the  Texans  two  days  later. 

While  under  custody  of  the  Texans,  Santa  Anna  signed  two 
treaties  with  the  Texas  government:  one  ended  hostilities  by 
pledging  the  withdrawal  of  Mexican  troops  to  positions  south 
of  the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte  (Rio  Grande),  and  the  other,  a 
secret  treaty,  recognized  Texan  independence  from  Mexico. 

The  Mexican-American  War 

After  Texas  attained  its  independence,  the  idea  of  its  incor- 
poration into  the  United  States  gained  support  both  in  Texas 
and  in  the  United  States  Congress.  Definitive  action  on  the 
measure  was  delayed  for  several  years,  however,  because  of  the 
divisive  issue  of  admitting  another  slave  state  into  the  United 
States  and  the  likely  prospect  that  annexation  would  provoke  a 
war  with  Mexico.  In  early  1845,  the  United  States  Congress 
passed  a  resolution  in  favor  of  the  annexation  of  Texas,  which 
prompted  Mexico  to  sever  diplomatic  relations  with  the  United 
States.  The  Mexican  congress  had  never  ratified  Santa  Anna's 
secret  treaty  with  the  Texans,  and  to  underscore  its  opposition 
to  Texas's  independence,  the  Mexican  congress  passed  a  law 
that  retroactively  annulled  any  treaties  signed  by  a  Mexican 
negotiator  while  in  captivity. 

Further  aggravating  the  dispute  was  the  fact  that  the  Texans 
had  issued  a  dubious  territorial  claim  that  expanded  the  repub- 
lic's southern  and  western  boundary  from  the  previously 
accepted  Nueces  River  to  the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte.  By  claiming 
all  of  the  land  up  to  the  headwaters  of  the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte, 
the  Texans  more  than  doubled  the  size  of  their  republic  to 
include  parts  of  present-day  New  Mexico,  Colorado,  Okla- 
homa, Kansas,  and  all  of  present-day  western  Texas. 

Shortly  after  Texas  was  admitted  to  the  Union  as  the  twenty- 
eighth  state,  President  James  K.  Polk  dispatched  a  special 
envoy,  John  Slidell,  to  Mexico  City  to  settle  the  Texas  boundary 


25 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

dispute  and  to  arrange  the  purchase  of  California.  The  Mexi- 
can president,  Jose  Joaqmn  Herrera,  had  been  willing  to  recog- 
nize an  independent  Texas  but  was  under  intense  domestic 
pressure  to  reject  United  States  annexation  and  Texas's 
expanded  territorial  claim.  As  a  result,  he  refused  to  meet 
Slidell  and  began  reinforcing  Mexican  army  units  along  the 
Rio  Bravo  del  Norte. 

Hostilities  between  Mexico  and  the  United  States  began  on 
April  25,  1846,  when  several  United  States  soldiers  were  killed 
in  a  cavalry  skirmish  with  Mexican  forces  in  the  disputed  terri- 
tory. Shortly  after  the  two  sides  declared  war,  Santa  Anna  was 
recalled  from  exile  in  Cuba  to  once  again  lead  Mexican  troops 
against  a  foreign  invasion. 

The  United  States  Army  attacked  on  three  fronts:  one  col- 
umn, under  General  Stephen  W.  Kearney,  occupied  California 
and  New  Mexico;  another  column,  under  General  Zachary  Tay- 
lor, entered  northern  Mexico;  and  a  third  detachment,  com- 
manded by  General  Winfield  Scott,  landed  at  Veracruz  and 
marched  to  Mexico  City.  California  and  New  Mexico  fell  with 
little  bloodshed.  Northern  Mexico  was  the  scene  of  fierce  bat- 
tles between  Taylor  and  Santa  Anna's  armies  at  Buena  Vista. 
Santa  Anna  initially  struck  hard  at  the  outnumbered  United 
States  forces,  but  he  later  abandoned  the  battle  and  returned 
to  Mexico  City,  prematurely  claiming  victory. 

The  heaviest  fighting  was  done  by  Scott's  Army  of  Occupa- 
tion, which  landed  at  Veracruz  on  March  9,  1847.  Rather  than 
attempt  to  occupy  the  city  outright,  Scott  positioned  his  forces 
west  of  it,  cutting  off  Veracruz's  supply  line  from  the  capital. 
After  several  days  of  heavy  naval  bombardment  that  killed  hun- 
dreds of  civilians,  Veracruz  surrendered  on  March  27,  1847. 

In  Mexico  City,  the  situation  was  chaotic.  President  once 
again,  Santa  Anna  denounced  both  congress  and  his  own  sub- 
ordinates in  the  executive  branch  for  their  lack  of  resolve  in 
preparing  the  defense  of  the  capital.  They,  in  turn,  denounced 
him  for  his  failures  in  battle.  On  August  20,  1847,  the  Army  of 
Occupation  asked  for  the  surrender  of  Mexico  City,  but  the 
battle  continued  until  September  13,  1847,  when  the  last  bas- 
tion of  Mexican  resistance  fell  during  the  famous  Battle  of 
Chapultepec.  During  the  battle,  young  cadets  from  the  Mexi- 
can military  academy,  the  Nihos  Heroes  (or  "boy  heroes")  leapt 
to  their  deaths  rather  than  surrender.  The  United  States  vic- 
tory marked  the  end  of  the  war  and  the  beginning  of  negotia- 
tions for  peace.

Treaty  of  Guadalupe  Hidalgo 

According  to  the  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  Guadalupe  Hidalgo 
of  February  2,  1848,  the  boundary  between  Mexico  and  the 
United  States  was  established  at  the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte. 
Mexico  was  then  required  to  relinquish  its  territories  of  New 
Mexico  and  Upper  California  (the  present-day  states  of  Califor- 
nia, Nevada,  Utah,  and  parts  of  Arizona,  New  Mexico,  Colo- 
rado, and  Wyoming)  and  to  accept  Texas's  incorporation  into 
the  United  States.  As  compensation,  the  United  States  agreed 
to  pay  US$15  million  for  the  territories  and  to  assume  more 
than  US$3  million  in  claims  from  private  citizens  of  these  areas 
against  the  Mexican  government.  Mexico  lost  more  than  one- 
half  of  its  territory  as  a  result  of  the  war  with  the  United  States. 
The  territorial  losses  and  the  brief  but  traumatic  occupation  of 
Mexico  City  by  United  States  troops  engendered  a  deep-seated 
mistrust  of  the  United  States  that  still  resonates  in  Mexican 
popular  culture.  Anti-United  States  nationalist  sentiment  was  a 
major  intellectual  current  in  the  Mexican  Revolution  and  con- 
tinues to  manifest  itself  in  some  aspects  of  Mexican  society  (see 
Foreign  Relations,  ch.  4). 

Santa  Anna's  last  political  venture  resulted  in  the  sale  of 
more  Mexican  territory.  In  what  is  known  in  the  United  States 
as  the  Gadsden  Purchase,  ratified  by  the  United  States  Con- 
gress in  1854,  Santa  Anna  sold  77,692  square  kilometers  of  land 
in  southern  New  Mexico  and  Arizona  for  US$10  million  (see 
fig.  2).  This  additional  loss  of  territory  alienated  a  large, 
reform-minded  group  of  young  Mexicans,  who  then  conspired 
to  oust  Santa  Anna. 

Reform  and  French  Intervention,  1855-67 

The  Revolution  of  Ayutla  and  the  Reform  Laws 

The  Mexican  reform  movement  was  inspired  by  the  liberal 
political  philosophies  of  European  intellectuals,  such  as  Jean- 
Jacques  Rousseau,  John  Stuart  Mill,  and  Pierre  Joseph  Proud- 
hon.  Their  views  were  adopted  by  a  group  of  Mexican  intellec- 
tuals who  shared  a  strong  commitment  to  moralize  Mexican 
politics.  The  most  outstanding  member  of  the  group  was 
Benito  Juarez,  a  Zapotec  lawyer  and  politician.  Juarez  and  his 
cohorts  went  into  exile  in  Louisiana,  where  they  drew  up  the 
Plan  of  Ayutla  in  1854  for  the  overthrow  of  Santa  Anna.  As  the 
plan  gained  broad-based  support,  the  conspirators  began  to

return  to  Mexico.  In  August  1855,  in  response  to  growing 
opposition,  Santa  Anna  resigned  for  the  last  time. 

A  provisional  government  was  installed  under  Juan  Ruiz  de 
Alvarez  and  the  intellectuals  of  Ayutla;  the  ensuing  period  of 
liberal  rule  came  to  be  known  as  the  Reform.  The  Reform  was 
touted  as  a  Mexican  version  of  the  French  Revolution.  Several 
laws,  known  collectively  as  the  Reform  Laws,  abolished  the 
fueros,  curtailed  ecclesiastical  property  holdings,  introduced  a 
civil  registry,  and  prohibited  the  church  from  charging  exorbi- 
tant fees  for  administering  the  sacraments. 

The  Reform  Laws  polarized  Mexican  society  along  pro-  and 
anticlerical  lines  at  a  time  when  delegates  were  preparing  the 
constitution  of  1857,  as  provided  for  in  the  Plan  of  Ayutla.  The 
new  constitution  was  derived  from  that  of  1824,  but  it  reflected 
a  more  liberal  vision  of  society  through  its  incorporation  of  the 
Reform  Laws.  It  reaffirmed  the  abolition  of  slavery,  secularized 
education,  and  guaranteed  basic  civil  liberties  for  all  Mexicans. 
Both  the  Reform  Laws  and  the  constitution,  however,  divided 
the  political  classes  and  set  the  stage  for  a  civil  war. 

Civil  War  and  the  French  Intervention 

The  civil  war,  commonly  known  as  the  War  of  the  Reform, 
that  engulfed  Mexico  between  1858  and  1861  brought  to  light 
the  underlying  conflicts  that  had  been  present  in  Mexican  soci- 
ety since  independence.  The  conservative  faction  launched  the 
Plan  of  Tacubaya  and,  with  the  support  of  the  military  and  the 
clergy,  dissolved  congress  and  arrested  Juarez.  Juarez  escaped 
and  established  a  "government  in  exile"  in  Queretaro  (the  lib- 
erals later  moved  their  capital  to  Veracruz) .  The  initial  military 
advantage  was  held  by  the  conservatives,  who  were  better 
armed  and  had  plentiful  supplies,  but  by  1860  the  situation  was 
reversed.  The  final  battle  took  place  just  before  Christmas 
1860.  The  victorious  liberal  army  entered  Mexico  City  on  Janu- 
ary 1,  1861. 

In  March  1861,  Juarez  won  the  presidential  election,  but  the 
war  left  the  treasury  depleted.  Trade  was  stagnant,  and  foreign 
creditors  were  demanding  full  repayment  of  Mexican  debts. 
Juarez  proceeded  to  declare  a  moratorium  on  all  foreign  debt 
repayments.  In  October  1861,  Spain,  Britain,  and  France 
decided  to  launch  a  joint  occupation  of  the  Mexican  Gulf  coast 
to  force  repayment.  In  December  troops  from  the  three 
nations  landed  at  Veracruz  and  began  deliberations.  Because 
the  representatives  of  the  three  nations  could  not  agree  on  the 


29

means  to  enforce  the  collection  of  the  debt,  Britain  and  Spain 
recalled  their  armies.  Spurred  by  dreams  of  reestablishing  an 
empire  in  the  New  World,  the  French  remained  and,  with  the 
support  of  Mexican  conservatives,  embarked  on  an  occupation 
of  Mexico. 

In  Puebla,  the  French  troops  encountered  strong  resistance 
led  by  one  of  Juarez's  trusted  men,  General  Ignacio  Zaragoza, 
who  defeated  the  foreigners  on  May  5,  1862  (May  5  is  cele- 
brated todav  as  one  of  Mexico's  two  national  holidays).  The  fol- 
lowing May,  Puebla  was  surrounded  once  again  by  French 
troops,  who  laid  siege  to  the  city  for  two  months  until  it  surren- 
dered. The  fall  of  Puebla  meant  easy  access  to  Mexico  City,  and 
Juarez  decided  to  evacuate  the  capital  after  receiving  approval 
from  congress. 

The  French  encountered  no  resistance  to  their  occupation 
of  Mexico  City.  In  June  1863,  a  provisional  government  was 
chosen,  and  in  October  a  delegation  of  Mexican  conservatives 
invited  Ferdinand  Maximilian  Joseph  von  Habsburg  of  Austria 
to  accept  the  Mexican  crown,  all  according  to  the  plans  of 
French  emperor  Napoleon  III.  Maximilian  was  a  well-inten- 
tioned monarch  who  accepted  the  crown  believing  that  this  act 
responded  to  the  desire  of  a  majority  of  Mexicans.  Before 
departing  for  Mexico,  Maximilian  signed  an  agreement  with 
Napoleon  III,  under  which  Maximilian  assumed  the  debts 
incurred  for  the  upkeep  of  the  French  army  in  Mexico.  On 
June  12,  1864,  the  Emperor  Maximilian  I  and  his  Belgian  wife, 
Marie  Charlotte  Amelie  Leopoldine,  now  called  Empress  Car- 
lota,  arrived  in  Mexico  City.  The  republican  government  under 
Juarez  retreated  to  the  far  north. 

Maximilian,  schooled  in  the  European  liberal  tradition,  was 
a  strong  supporter  of  Mexican  nationalism.  He  soon  found 
resistance  from  all  quarters  of  the  political  spectrum,  however. 
The  conservatives  expected  the  emperor  to  act  against  the 
Reform  Laws,  but  Maximilian  refused  to  revoke  them.  Mexican 
liberals  appealed  for  military  assistance  from  the  United  States 
on  the  basis  of  the  French  violation  of  the  1823  Monroe  Doc- 
trine, but  the  United  States  was  involved  in  its  own  civil  war. 
The  end  of  the  Civil  War  in  the  United  States  in  1865,  however, 
prompted  a  more  assertive  foreign  policy  toward  Mexico  and 
released  manpower  and  arms  that  wTere  directed  to  help  Juarez 
in  his  fight  against  the  French.  In  Europe,  France  was  increas- 
insrlv  threatened  bv  a  belligerent  Prussia.  Bv  November  1866, 
Napoleon  III  began  recalling  his  troops  stationed  in  Mexico.

Historical  Setting 


Conservative  forces  switched  sides  and  began  supporting  the 
Mexican  liberals.  United  republican  forces  resumed  their  cam- 
paign on  February  19,  1867,  and  on  May  15,  Maximilian  sur- 
rendered. He  was  tried  and,  on  Juarez's  orders,  was  executed 
on  June  19. 

The  Restoration,  1 867-76 

The  liberal  republicans  under  Juarez's  leadership  consoli- 
dated the  victory  of  the  principles  of  the  constitution  of  1857. 
The  Restoration,  as  the  period  from  1867  to  1876  is  called,  was 
marked  by  peace  and  tolerance  toward  the  conservatives. 
Juarez  returned  to  Mexico  City  on  July  15,  1867,  called  for  pres- 
idential elections,  and  presented  himself  as  a  candidate.  By  the 
end  of  the  year,  he  was  victorious. 

The  economy  and  the  education  system  were  vitally  impor- 
tant to  Juarez's  new  administration.  Economic  development 
was  based  on  the  improvement  of  communications,  the  exploi- 
tation of  the  country's  natural  resources,  and  the  revamping  of 
the  mining  sector  through  favorable  tax  guidelines.  Seeking  to 
reduce  banditry  and  to  attract  investment  capital,  Juarez 
strengthened  the  rurales,  the  Rural  Defense  Force  (Guardia 
Rural)  responsible  for  the  security  of  roads  and  land  cargo, 
and  placed  it  under  the  Ministry  of  Interior.  The  improvement 
of  communications  began  with  the  completion  in  1873  of  the 
railroad  that  linked  Mexico  City  with  Veracruz,  a  Mexican  ven- 
ture that  had  been  started  in  the  1850s.  In  the  area  of  educa- 
tion, a  complete  reorganization  was  directed  by  a  commission 
headed  by  the  prominent  physician  and  positivist  intellectual, 
Gabino  Barreda.  He  devised  a  school  curriculum  that  concen- 
trated on  mathematics  and  the  physical  sciences.  For  the  first 
time,  education  became  mandatory.  Despite  new  schools,  the 
liberal  aspiration  for  literacy  and  schools  open  to  all  remained 
an  unfulfilled  goal,  as  in  most  nineteenth-century  rural  societ- 
ies. 

At  the  end  of  his  term  in  1871,  Juarez  decided  to  seek  reelec- 
tion. His  opponents  were  Jose  de  la  Cruz  Porfirio  Diaz  and 
Sebastian  Lerdo  de  Tejada,  whose  candidacies  divided  the  lib- 
eral faction  and  resulted  in  none  of  the  candidates  receiving  a 
majority  of  the  votes.  With  no  clear  winner,  it  was  up  to  con- 
gress to  choose  among  the  three  candidates  or  to  reelect  the 
incumbent  president.  The  congress  chose  Juarez.  Diaz  invoked 
the  principle  of  "no  reelection"  in  the  constitution  of  1857  and 


31 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


staged  a  revolt  in  November  1871.  On  July  18,  1872,  amidst  the 
Diaz  rebellion,  Juarez  died  of  a  heart  attack. 

New  elections  were  called  in  1872,  and  Lerdo  won  the  presi- 
dency. His  administration  was  characterized  by  a  continuous 
effort  to  bring  peace  to  the  country,  and  he  intervened  militar- 
ily in  the  countryside  whenever  it  was  necessary.  Lerdo  main- 
tained the  emphasis  on  communications  through  new  railroad 
and  telegraph  lines.  In  education,  he  directed  his  energies  to 
the  construction  of  new  schools  and  the  enrollment  of  more 
students.  When  the  time  came  for  electing  a  new  president, 
Lerdo  showed  interest  in  another  four-year  term.  Diaz  rose  in 
rebellion  a  second  time  in  March  1876,  again  defending  the 
"no  reelection"  principle.  Lerdo  went  into  exile  in  the  United 
States,  and  on  November  21,  1876,  Diaz  occupied  Mexico  City. 
A  political  mastermind,  surrounded  by  capable  advisers,  he 
held  power  directly  or  indirectly  for  the  next  thirty-four  years. 
The  period  known  as  the  "Porfiriato"  (the  period  of  Porfirio 
Diaz's  rule)  had  begun. 

The  Porfiriato,  1876-1910 

Propitious  economic  conditions  did  not  greet  Porfirio  Diaz 
upon  his  rise  to  power  in  1876.  Mexico  remained  saddled  with 
a  huge  foreign  debt  and  an  empty  treasury.  An  army  of  bureau- 
crats was  owed  back  wages,  the  country  had  a  poor  interna- 
tional credit  rating,  and  persistent  current  account  deficits 
caused  serious  balance  of  payments  problems.  Investment, 
whether  foreign  or  domestic,  was  scarce,  and  the  mining  indus- 
try had  yet  to  recover  from  the  revolutionary  wars.  The  rela- 
tively few  mines  in  operation  in  1876  were  exploited 
haphazardly,  and  extraction  and  smelting  techniques  were 
archaic.  Only  a  few  miles  of  rail  had  been  laid,  transportation 
and  communications  were  rudimentary,  and  dock  facilities 
were  dilapidated  and  unsafe.  Endemic  rural  violence  further 
hindered  commerce. 

During  his  first  four  years  in  office,  Diaz  began  to  tackle  eco- 
nomic backwardness.  He  first  decreed  stiff  measures  against 
contraband  moving  across  the  United  States  border.  Smugglers 
and  bandits  crossed  the  border  from  both  sides,  but  Diaz  would 
not  permit  United  States  troops  to  enter  Mexico  in  search  of 
them.  Instead,  he  enlarged  the  Mexican  border  patrol.  In  1877 
Diaz  agreed  to  honor  US$4  million  in  claims  by  United  States 
citizens  against  Mexico.

In  1880  at  the  end  of  his  term  and  despite  his  followers' 
wishes,  Diaz  left  office.  The  next  president,  Manuel  Gonzalez, 
continued  Diaz's  modernization  program.  Telegraph  lines 
began  to  operate,  and  railroad  construction  was  kept  apace.  In 
an  attempt  to  meet  his  foreign  debt  obligations,  Gonzalez  with- 
held the  salaries  of  government  officials,  a  move  that  led  to  a 
harsh  campaign  against  the  president. 

During  Gonzalez's  tenure,  Diaz  gathered  a  large  following 
that  restored  him  to  office  in  1884.  Mexican  positivism,  embod- 
ied in  the  slogan  "order  and  progress,"  was  the  backbone  of  the 
modernization  scheme  supported  by  the  cientificos,  intellectual 
followers  of  Barreda.  Led  by  Jose  Ives  Limantour,  who  served  as 
adviser  to  Diaz,  the  cientificos  developed  a  plan  for  economic 
recovery  that  was  to  be  carried  out  through  the  next  twenty- 
seven  years  of  the  Porfiriato. 

Porfirian  Modernization 

Diaz's  strategy  of  export-oriented  growth  led  to  Mexico's 
rapid  integration  into  the  world  economy.  The  modernization 
program  was  based  on  exploitation  of  the  country's  natural 
resources,  using  cheap  domestic  labor  and  foreign  capital  and 
technology  for  export  production. 


33 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Foreign  capital  fueled  dynamic  growth,  and  an  expanding 
rail  network  promoted  export  agriculture,  manufacturing,  and 
mining.  Agriculture  and  livestock  export  products  expanded  to 
include  cattle  and  cattle  hides,  coffee,  cotton,  henequen,  sugar, 
vanilla,  and  chicle.  Railroads  allowed  the  exploitation  of  new 
land  in  the  north  for  cotton  cultivation  and  enabled  Mexico  to 
double  its  cotton  production  between  1887  and  1910. 

The  Diaz  regime  encouraged  manufacturing  through 
export  incentives,  high  protective  tariffs  on  foreign  manufac- 
tured products,  low  transportation  costs,  and  abolition  of  the 
transactions  tax  on  business.  The  number  of  industrial  enter- 
prises— most  of  them  heavily  backed  by  United  States,  French, 
German,  and  British  investors — grew  rapidly,  and  the  volume 
of  manufactured  goods  doubled  between  1877  and  1910. 

The  railroads  also  contributed  to  the  revival  of  mining 
because  they  provided  the  only  feasible  means  of  transporting 
huge  amounts  of  ore.  Legal  reforms  in  1884  lowered  taxes  on 
mining  and  allowed  foreign  ownership  of  subsoil  resources, 
spurring  a  large  increase  in  United  States  and  European  invest- 
ment in  Mexican  mines. 

Society  under  the  Porfiriato 

Ironically,  Mexico's  economic  success  during  the  Porfiriato 
had  negative  social  consequences.  Although  the  economy  grew 
at  an  average  annual  rate  of  2.6  percent,  real  income  per  capita 
had  recovered  only  to  pre-1821  levels  by  1911.  After  1900 
unemployment  increased  as  mechanization  displaced  artisans 
faster  than  unskilled  workers  were  absorbed  into  new  produc- 
tive enterprises.  Additionally,  real  and  financial  assets  were 
increasingly  concentrated  in  the  hands  of  a  few  local  and  for- 
eign investors. 

The  rural  peasantry  bore  most  of  the  cost  of  modernization. 
Government  seizure  of  private  and  communal  land  increased 
the  landless  rural  population  and  led  to  further  concentration 
of  land  ownership.  Taking  advantage  of  an  1883  land  law 
intended  to  encourage  foreign  investment,  by  1888  land  com- 
panies had  obtained  possession  of  more  than  27.5  million  hect- 
ares of  rural  land.  By  1894  these  companies  controlled  one- 
fifth  of  Mexico's  total  territory.  By  1910  most  villages  had  lost 
their  ejidos  (communal  land  holdings — see  Glossary),  a  few 
hundred  wealthy  families  held  some  54.3  million  hectares  of 
the  country's  most  productive  land,  and  more  than  half  of  all 
rural  Mexicans  worked  on  these  families'  huge  haciendas. 


34 


Historical  Setting 


The  modernization  program  was  also  brought  about  at  the 
expense  of  personal  and  political  freedom.  Diaz  made  certain 
that  "order"  was  maintained  at  all  costs  for  the  sake  of 
"progress."  Force  was  used  whenever  necessary  to  neutralize 
opponents  of  the  regime.  Freedom  of  the  press  was  nonexist- 
ent. The  army  and  the  rurales  became  the  forces  of  repression 
for  the  maintenance  of  the  Porfirian  peace  during  the  Porfi- 
riato.  Mock  elections  were  held  at  all  levels  of  government, 
while  Diaz  appointed  his  loyal  friends  as  political  bosses. 
Despite  the  modernization,  Mexico  remained  a  predominantly 
poor  and  rural  country,  and  class  stratification  became 
entrenched. 

The  wealth  that  flowed  into  urban  areas  during  the  Porfi- 
riato  fostered  the  growth  of  an  urban  middle  class  of  white-col- 
lar workers,  artisans,  and  entrepreneurs.  The  middle  class  had 
little  use  for  anything  Mexican,  but  instead  identified  strongly 
with  the  European  manners  and  tastes  adopted  by  the  urban 
upper  class.  The  emulation  of  Europe  was  especially  evident  in 
the  arts  and  in  architecture,  to  the  detriment  of  indigenous 
forms  of  cultural  expression.  The  identification  of  the  urban 
middle  class  with  the  European  values  promoted  by  Diaz  fur- 
ther aggravated  the  schism  between  urban  and  rural  Mexico. 

The  Revolution,  1910-20 

The  Early  Phase 

In  the  political  arena,  the  Porfiriato  was  marked  by  the  sys- 
tematic violation  of  the  principles  of  the  constitution  of  1857. 
Diaz  courted  foreign  interests,  allowed  the  clergy  again  to 
become  openly  influential  in  temporal  matters,  and  gave  the 
army  a  free  hand  to  violate  guaranteed  civil  liberties  while 
opponents  of  the  regime  were  either  coopted  or  sent  to  jail. 

Meanwhile,  liberal  writers  and  journalists  began  to  challenge 
the  regime.  These  attacks  became  more  coordinated  with  the 
organization  of  liberal  clubs  and  a  liberal  convention  at  San 
Luis  Potosi  in  1900  and  1901  that  defended  the  principles  of 
the  constitution  of  1857.  For  the  next  two  years,  liberal  con- 
gresses were  held,  but  the  persecution  of  representatives  led 
many  liberals  to  seek  asylum  in  the  United  States.  The  exiles 
(especially  the  Flores  Magon  brothers,  Juan  Saraia,  Antonio  I. 
Villareal,  and  Librado  Rivera)  issued  a  liberal  proclamation  on 
July  1,  1906,  from  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  that  called  for  the  over- 
throw of  Diaz.  They  then  started  a  publication,  Redencion,  to  set 


35 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


forth  their  ideas.  The  program  presented  in  the  proclamation 
of  St.  Louis  introduced  new  concepts  in  education,  labor  rela- 
tions, land  distribution,  and  agricultural  credit.  These  ideas 
reached  Mexico  through  issues  of  Redencion  smuggled  across 
the  border. 

In  1908  an  unexpected  development  brought  hope  of  politi- 
cal change  to  the  anti-Diaz  political  opposition.  In  an  interview 
with  a  United  States  reporter,  Diaz  stated  that  he  would  not 
seek  reelection  in  1910.  Liberals  and  dissident  intellectuals 
immediately  seized  the  opportunity  and  nominated  Francisco 
I.  Madero,  the  scion  of  a  wealthy  family  in  Coahuila,  to  run  in 
the  upcoming  election.  In  June  1910,  relying  on  harsh  mea- 
sures, including  the  imprisonment  of  thousands  of  opposition 
activists,  Diaz  was  reelected.  Madero,  himself  imprisoned,  was 
released  from  jail  and  went  into  exile  in  the  United  States. 

Diaz  began  preparing  a  joint  celebration — the  one-hun- 
dredth anniversary  of  Mexican  independence  and  his  eightieth 
birthday — in  September  1910.  Mexico  City  went  through  a  full 
refurbishing.  Buildings  were  dedicated,  monuments  were 
unveiled,  and  numerous  balls  and  celebrations  were  attended 
by  the  entire  diplomatic  corps.  The  streets  of  the  capital  were 
cleared  of  refuse  and  undesirables  in  order  to  present  foreign- 
ers with  a  positive  picture  of  the  society  created  by  the  Porfi- 
riato. 

In  October  1910,  Madero  drafted  the  Plan  of  San  Luis 
Potosi,  which  called  for  the  people  to  rise  on  November  20  to 
demand  the  restoration  of  the  democratic  principles  of  the 
constitution  of  1857  and  the  replacement  of  Diaz  with  a  provi- 
sional government.  Although  it  was  mainly  a  political  docu- 
ment with  scant  reference  to  redressing  Mexico's  many  social 
ills,  the  Plan  of  San  Luis  Potosi  was  enthusiastically  received 
among  the  widespread,  but  uncoordinated  movements  that 
were  already  on  the  verge  of  rebellion  against  their  respective 
state  governments.  Copies  of  the  plan,  which  Madero  had 
drafted  in  St.  Louis,  soon  reached  Mexico  and  were  widely  dis- 
tributed. On  the  appointed  day,  Madero  and  a  small  band  of 
rebels  crossed  into  Mexico,  but  finding  no  rebel  armies  with 
which  to  rendezvous,  they  soon  turned  back. 

By  January  1911,  however,  a  large-scale  insurrection  had  bro- 
ken out  in  the  northern  state  of  Chihuahua,  led  by  Pascual 
Orozco,  a  local  merchant,  and  Francisco  "Pancho"  Villa. 
Madero,  who  had  declared  himself  provisional  president  in  the 
Plan  of  San  Luis  Potosi,  returned  to  Mexico  to  lead  the  nascent

revolution.  The  successes  of  the  rebel  bands  in  Chihuahua 
sparked  similar  uprisings  throughout  the  country.  As  early  as 
1909  in  Morelos,  the  peasant  leader,  Emiliano  Zapata,  had 
recruited  thousands  of  hacienda  laborers  and  landless  peasants 
to  attack  the  haciendas  and  reclaim  lost  lands. 

In  April  Diaz  sent  finance  minister  Limantour  to  negotiate 
an  armistice  with  the  northern  rebels,  who  were  besieging 
Ciudad  Juarez.  When  Limantour  refused  to  negotiate  Diaz's 
resignation,  Villa  and  Orozco  renewed  their  attack  on  Ciudad 
Juarez  and  captured  the  town.  By  May  several  state  capitals  had 
been  lost  to  the  rebels,  and  mobs  filled  the  streets  of  Mexico 
City  shouting  for  Diaz  to  resign.  On  May  25,  1911,  the  eighty- 
year-old  dictator  submitted  his  resignation  to  congress  and 
turned  power  over  to  a  provisional  government.  The  following 
day  Diaz  quietly  sailed  for  exile  in  France. 

Madero's  Government 

Madero  assumed  the  presidency  in  November  1911.  The 
new  administration  faced  insurmountable  problems.  The  fall 
of  Diaz  raised  popular  expectations  of  far-reaching  social 
reforms,  especially  land  reform.  Zapata  had  come  to  Mexico 
City  to  claim  hacienda  land  for  the  peasants  of  Morelos,  which 
to  him  was  the  only  acceptable  result  of  the  overthrow  of  the 
Diaz  regime.  Instead,  Madero  ordered  Zapata  to  disband  his 
troops,  and  reluctantly  Zapata  acceded  to  Madero's  request. 
The  interim  government  did  not  think  Zapata  was  demobiliz- 
ing fast  enough,  however,  and  sent  federal  troops  to  disarm  the 
revolutionaries  by  force.  Even  though  Madero  was  not  respon- 
sible for  this  action,  Zapata  withdrew  his  support  for  Madero. 
Madero  soon  realized  that  to  the  liberals,  the  Revolution 
meant  political  change,  but  to  the  revolutionary  fighters  it 
meant  radical  social  and  economic  transformations  that 
Madero  would  not  be  able  to  fulfill.  Madero  dealt  with  the 
labor  and  land  tenure  problems  politically  through  the 
National  Agrarian  Commission  and  the  Department  of  Labor. 
However,  the  only  tangible  change  was  that  labor  groups  felt 
free  to  organize.  They  were  also  allowed  to  publish  the  newspa- 
per Luz.  Labor  unrest  continued,  despite  the  government's 
attempts  to  control  strikes.  Madero's  democratic  administra- 
tion was  failing  its  staunchest  supporters,  and  rebellions  began 
to  surface. 

In  November  the  Zapatista  faction  revolted  under  the  princi- 
ples of  the  Plan  of  Ayala,  which  asked  for  restoration  of  pri-

vately  owned  lands  to  rural  villages.  The  armed  revolt  spread 
through  the  states  of  Morelos,  Guerrero,  Tlaxcala,  Puebla, 
Mexico,  and  even  into  Mexico  City.  By  1912  the  Zapatista 
forces  had  caused  severe  damage  to  railroad  and  telegraph 
lines  and  had  won  several  battles  against  federal  troops. 

Revolutionaries  from  other  areas  began  to  challenge  the 
new  government,  and  an  offensive  was  launched  in  March  1912 
by  Orozco,  who  accused  Madero  of  abandoning  the  principles 
of  the  Plan  of  San  Luis  Potosi.  Orozco  was  defeated,  however, 
by  Victoriano  Huerta,  the  unscrupulous  commander  of  the 
federal  forces.  Meanwhile,  Felix  Diaz  (Porfirio's  nephew)  was 
assembling  an  army  in  Veracruz  to  march  against  Madero,  but 
Madero  was  able  to  order  his  arrest  andbring  him  to  Mexico 
City. 

Felix  Diaz  and  other  counterrevolutionaries  plotted  a  mili- 
tary coup  from  inside  prison  and  proceeded  to  take  the 
National  Palace  on  February  8,  1913.  With  the  aid  of  loyal 
troops  under  Huerta,  Madero  initially  resisted  the  Diaz  forces, 
but  street  fighting  and  chaos  overtook  the  city.  On  February 
18,  Huerta,  seeing  an  opportunity  to  seize  power,  joined  the 
coup  against  Madero  and  had  both  the  president  and  Vice 
President  Jose  Maria  Pino  Suarez  arrested. 

Huerta's  decision  to  change  sides  was  made  with  the  knowl- 
edge and  assistance  of  United  States  ambassador  Henry  Lane 
Wilson  in  what  became  known  as  the  Pact  of  the  Embassy. 
Huerta  extracted  resignations  from  both  Madero  and  Pino 
Suarez  and  had  himself  appointed  secretary  of  interior,  which 
made  him  the  heir  to  the  presidency,  according  to  the  provi- 
sions of  the  constitution  of  1857.  That  same  evening,  Huerta 
was  sworn  in  as  president,  and  on  February  21,  Madero  and 
Pino  Suarez  were  assassinated  while  being  transferred  to  the 
penitentiary  in  Mexico  City. 

The  Huerta  Dictatorship 

Opposition  to  Huerta  began  to  emerge  once  he  assumed 
power.  Venustiano  Carranza  in  Coahuila,  Villa  in  Chihuahua, 
and  Alvaro  Obregon  in  Sonora  formed  a  front  against  the  dic- 
tator under  the  Plan  of  Guadalupe,  issued  in  March  1913. 
Zapata  preferred  to  maintain  his  troops'  independence  from 
the  northern  coalition,  but  remained  in  revolt  against  Huerta. 
The  latter  responded  by  increasing  the  size  of  the  military  by 
forced  conscription.  Federal  forces  terrorized  the  countryside 
and  looted  villages,  and  political  assassinations  became  a  trade-

mark  of  Huerta's  rule.  The  country  faced  other  problems.  The 
federal  treasury  was  empty,  and  each  faction  began  issuing  its 
own  currency.  Huerta's  government  had  not  been  recognized 
by  the  United  States,  which  considered  him  a  usurper  of  the 
previously  elected  government.  Seeking  a  return  to  constitu- 
tional rule,  the  administration  of  President  Woodrow  Wilson 
channeled  aid  indirectly  to  the  northern  coalition. 

By  early  1914,  Huerta  was  clearly  losing  on  all  fronts,  but 
there  was  one  specific  event  that  precipitated  his  resignation. 
When  United  States  sailors  were  arrested  at  Veracruz  for  tres- 
passing on  dock  facilities,  the  commander  of  the  United  States 
naval  forces  off  Tampico  demanded  ceremonial  salutes  of  the 
United  States  flag  by  Mexican  personnel.  When  the  United 
States  demands  were  not  met,  United  States  troops  occupied 
Veracruz.  Indignation  brought  about  a  series  of  reprisals 
against  United  States  citizens  and  their  flag  throughout 
Mexico.  In  the  face  of  growing  disorder,  Huerta  resigned  on 
July  8,  1914. 

The  Constitution  of  1 91 7 

After  the  fall  of  Huerta,  Carranza,  chief  of  the  northern  coa- 
lition, invited  all  revolutionary  leaders  to  a  military  conference 
at  Aguascalientes  to  determine  the  future  course  of  Mexico.  A 
split  developed  almost  immediately:  on  one  side  were 
Carranza,  Obregon,  and  supporters  of  the  plans  of  San  Luis 
Potosf  and  Guadalupe;  on  the  other  side  were  Zapata,  Villa, 
and  the  supporters  of  the  Plan  of  Ayala.  The  convention  chose 
Eulalio  Gutierrez,  who  had  the  support  of  the  Villistas  and  the 
Zapatistas,  as  provisional  president,  while  Carranza,  with 
Obregon's  support,  established  a  dissident  government  in  Vera- 
cruz. The  country  went  through  another  period  of  civil  war 
and  anarchy  in  which  four  governments  claimed  to  represent 
the  will  of  the  people:  Carranza  in  Veracruz,  Obregon  in 
Mexico  City  (after  Gutierrez  had  left  the  city  and  established 
his  headquarters  in  Nuevo  Leon),  Roque  Gonzalez  Garza  (sup- 
ported by  the  Zapatistas),  and  Villa  in  Guanajuato.  Later  that 
year,  Carranza  emerged  as  the  victorious  commander  of  the 
revolutionary  forces.  His  government  was  soon  recognized  by 
the  United  States,  and  his  troops  were  supplied  by  munitions 
abandoned  when  United  States  forces  left  Veracruz. 

United  States  support  for  Carranza  prompted  an  aggressive 
reaction  from  Villa.  After  1916  Villa  frequently  raided  United 
States  border  towns  and  then  retreated  to  Mexico.  United

States  General  John  J.  "Blackjack"  Pershing's  troops  crossed  the 
border  in  pursuit  of  Villa  several  times  during  1917.  Despite 
Villa's  "victories"  over  Pershing,  the  true  victor  was  Carranza. 
To  consolidate  his  power  further  and  to  institutionalize  the 
Revolution,  he  called  for  a  meeting  at  Queretaro,  where  the 
constitutionalists  drew  up  a  new  supreme  law  for  Mexico.  The 
Congress  of  Queretaro  met  for  the  first  time  on  December  1, 
1916.  In  commemoration  of  that  event,  the  inauguration  of  all 
Mexican  constitutional  presidents  has  taken  place  on  Decem- 
ber 1. 

Carranza  presented  his  draft  of  a  constitution  to  the  con- 
gress. The  draft  was  similar  in  many  ways  to  the  constitution  of 
1857,  but  gave  extensive  powers  to  the  executive.  The  final  ver- 
sion of  the  constitution  of  1917,  however,  gave  additional  rights 
to  the  Mexican  people.  It  was  the  fruit  of  the  Revolution — an 
expression  of  popular  will  that  guaranteed  civil  liberties,  no 
presidential  succession,  and  protection  from  foreign  and 
domestic  exploitation  to  all  Mexicans  (see  Constitutional  His- 
tory, ch.  4). 

Carranza' s  Presidency 

After  formally  accepting  the  constitution  of  1917,  Carranza 
won  the  presidential  election  and  was  sworn  into  office  on  May 
1,  1917.  Conditions  in  Mexico  were  again  close  to  chaos:  the 
economy  had  deteriorated  during  the  years  of  civil  war,  com- 
munications had  been  seriously  disrupted,  and  shortages  had 
led  to  rampant  inflation.  Land  and  labor  remained  the  basic 
issues  for  the  Mexican  people,  but  Carranza  chose  to  overlook 
the  constitutional  provisions  dealing  with  these  issues  and 
returned  lands  expropriated  during  the  Revolution.  Despite 
the  president's  opposition,  public  enthusiasm  for  the  labor  pro- 
visions of  Article  123  led  to  the  creation  in  1918  of  the 
Regional  Confederation  of  Mexican  Workers  (Confederation 
Regional  de  Obreros  Mexicanos — CROM),  which  would  unify 
and  lead  the  labor  movement  in  the  years  ahead.  Meanwhile, 
Mexico  took  advantage  of  United  States  involvement  overseas 
in  World  War  I,  its  attention  and  troops  distant  from  any  fur- 
ther intervention  in  Mexico. 

In  1918  parts  of  the  country  still  saw  military  action;  the 
fighting  was  particularly  fierce  in  Morelos.  The  Zapatistas  in 
that  area,  who  had  very  specific  grievances,  wanted  more  than 
a  constitution.  In  March  1919,  Zapata  sent  an  open  letter  to 
Carranza,  hoping  by  this  means  to  bring  the  Zapatistas' 


41 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

demands  before  the  whole  population.  Zapata  expected  that 
Carranza,  once  confronted  by  public  pressure,  would  be  willing 
to  address  the  Zapatistas'  grievances.  Carranza's  response  was 
very  different,  however.  Jesus  M.  Guajardo,  a  colonel  in  the  fed- 
eral army,  was  contracted  to  deceive  Zapata  by  offering  alle- 
giance to  the  revolutionaries.  Zapata's  cautious  acceptance  of 
Guajardo's  protests  of  loyalty  led  to  a  meeting  on  April  10, 
1919,  in  Zapata's  territory.  As  Zapata  entered  the  meeting  area, 
Guajardo's  men  appeared  ready  to  fire  a  salute  in  his  honor  but 
instead  they  fired  point-blank,  killing  the  peasant  leader  and 
thereby  eliminating  the  last  significant  military  opposition. 

In  1920  just  as  Carranza  was  about  to  nominate  a  loyal  subor- 
dinate, Ignacio  Bonilla,  to  serve  as  a  puppet  president,  Adolfo 
de  la  Huerta  and  Plutarco  Elias  Calles  rose  in  opposition. 
Under  the  Plan  of  Agua  Prieta,  they  raised  a  constitutionalist 
army  of  northerners  and  marched  to  Mexico  City.  Carranza 
fled  the  capital  and  was  assassinated  in  May  while  on  the  road 
to  exile.  De  la  Huerta  served  briefly  as  provisional  president, 
but  was  replaced  in  November  1920  by  Obregon,  who  was 
elected  to  a  four-year  term.  Shortly  thereafter,  Villa  accepted  a 
peace  offer  from  the  federal  government. 

The  Constructive  Phase,  1 920-40 

The  Obregon  Presidency,  1920-24 

The  four  years  of  Obregon's  presidency  (1920-24)  were  ded- 
icated to  beginning  to  realize  the  objectives  of  the  constitution 
of  1917.  The  military  phase  of  the  Revolution  was  over,  and  the 
new  administration  began  to  build  the  bases  for  the  next  stage 
of  the  revolutionary  process  of  reconstruction. 

Obregon's  choice  for  secretary  of  education  was  Jose  Vascon- 
celos,  a  distinguished  lawyer  and  professor  who  had  rejected 
the  elitist  positivism  of  the  cientificos.  Vasconcelos  adapted  the 
curricula  of  rural  schools  to  Mexican  reality  by  teaching  stu- 
dents basic  skills  in  reading,  writing,  mathematics,  history,  and 
geography.  Seeking  to  integrate  indigenous  peoples  into  Mexi- 
can society  through  education,  Vasconcelos  dispatched  hun- 
dreds of  teachers  to  remote  villages.  Between  1920  and  1924, 
more  than  1,000  rural  schools  and  more  than  2,000  public 
libraries  were  established.  Vasconcelos  also  believed  in  instruct- 
ing through  images,  and  for  that  purpose  he  commissioned 
works  by  Mexican  muralists — foremost  among  them  Diego 


42 


Historical  Setting 


Rivera — to  decorate  public  buildings  while  depicting  impor- 
tant events  in  Mexican  history  and  the  ideals  of  the  Revolution. 

Obregon's  agrarian  policies  proved  more  traditional.  He 
believed  that  the  Mexican  economy  could  not  afford  to  forego 
productivity  for  the  sake  of  radical  agrarian  reform.  Conse- 
quently, redistribution  of  land  proceeded  slowly.  During  his 
administration,  Obregon  redistributed  1.2  million  hectares  to 
landless  peasants,  a  fraction  of  the  eligible  land.  Obregon  was 
careful  in  handling  Article  27  of  the  constitution,  which 
restricted  land  ownership  by  foreigners,  because  of  fear  of 
intervention  by  the  United  States.  Despite  Obregon's  modera- 
tion, United  States  oil  companies  launched  a  campaign  against 
the  Mexican  government,  fearing  possible  implementation  of 
Article  27.  A  joint  Mexican-United  States  commission  agreed  to 
meet  on  Bucarelli  Street  in  Mexico  City  in  1923.  Under  the 
terms  of  the  commission  agreements,  known  as  the  Bucarelli 
Agreements,  Mexico  upheld  the  principle  of  "positive  acts." 
Mexico  agreed  that  if  a  foreign  enterprise  improved  the  land 
(in  the  case  of  oil,  by  installing  oil  drilling  equipment),  the 
company's  holdings  would  not  be  nationalized.  The  United 
States  fulfilled  its  part  of  the  agreement  by  recognizing  the 
Mexican  government. 

When  the  time  came  for  the  next  presidential  nomination, 
Obregon's  choice  was  his  secretary  of  interior,  Plutarco  Elias 
Calles.  The  nomination  met  with  strong  opposition  from  land- 
owners, who  feared  Calles's  radical  reputation.  Obregon  suc- 
ceeded in  imposing  his  candidate  because  Calles  had  the 
support  of  labor  unions  and  Mexican  nationalists.  Overall, 
Obregon's  government  disappointed  the  more  radical  revolu- 
tionary factions,  as  well  as  conservative  interests,  such  as  the 
military,  wealthy  landowners,  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church, 
but  it  brought  Mexico  a  welcome  degree  of  political  stability. 

The  Calles  Presidency,  1924-28 

Calles  was  perhaps  Mexico's  strongest  political  figure  since 
the  Diaz  dictatorship.  Calles  began  seriously  to  implement 
agrarian  reform  by  distributing  some  3.2  million  hectares  of 
land  during  his  term,  in  addition  to  developing  agricultural 
credit  and  irrigation.  Labor  was  still  organized  into  one 
national  union,  CROM,  run  by  Calles's  crony  Luis  Morones, 
even  though  independent  unions  were  emerging.  Public  edu- 
cation facilities  continued  to  expand,  and  Calles's  administra- 
tion built  another  2,000  schools. 


43 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


A  major  crisis  developed,  however,  between  the  government 
and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  In  1926  the  archbishop  of 
Mexico  City,  Jose  Mora  y  del  Rio,  made  public  his  view  that 
Roman  Catholics  could  not  follow  the  religious  provisions  of 
the  constitution  of  1917.  In  defiance  of  the  declaration  by  the 
archbishop,  Calles  decided  to  implement  fully  several  of  the 
constitutional  provisions:  religious  processions  were  prohib- 
ited; the  church's  educational  establishments,  convents,  and 
monasteries  were  closed;  foreign  priests  and  nuns  were 
deported;  and  priests  were  required  to  register  with  the  govern- 
ment before  receiving  permission  to  perform  their  religious 
duties.  The  church  reacted  by  going  on  strike  on  July  31,  1926, 
and  during  the  three  years  that  followed,  no  sacraments  were 
administered.  Bloody  revolts  broke  out  in  the  states  of  Micho- 
acan,  Puebla,  Oaxaca,  Zacatecas,  Jalisco,  and  Nayarit.  To  the 
call  of  "Viva  Cristo  Rey"  (Long  live  Christ  the  King),  bands  of 
militant  Roman  Catholics,  known  as  Cristeros,  attacked  govern- 
ment officials  and  facilities  and  burned  public  schools.  The 
government  responded  with  overwhelming  force,  using  the 
army  and  its  own  partisan  bands  of  Red  Shirts  to  fight  the  Cris- 
teros. The  fighting  was  vicious,  with  both  sides  engaging  in 
indiscriminate  acts  of  terrorism  against  civilians  and  wide- 
spread destruction  of  property.  By  1929  the  revolt  had  been 
largely  contained,  and  the  Cristeros  were  compelled  to  lay 
down  their  arms  and  accept  most  of  the  government's  terms. 

The  Maximato 

In  defiance  of  the  "no-reelection"  principle  that  had  been 
one  of  the  key  political  legacies  of  the  Revolution,  Calles  sup- 
ported Obregon's  bid  to  recapture  the  presidency  in  1928. 
Beginning  with  the  1928  election,  the  presidential  term  was 
increased  from  four  to  six  years  (sexenio).  Thereafter,  the  sexenio 
formed  the  basis  for  regular  and  orderly  political  succession. 
Obregon  won  the  election  but  was  assassinated  by  a  religious 
fanatic  before  taking  office  on  July  17,  1928.  Seeking  to  ensure 
political  stability,  Calles  opted  not  to  violate  the  "no-reelection" 
principle  and  instead  chose  one  of  his  supporters,  Emilio 
Portes  Gil,  as  interim  president  (December  1928  to  February 
1930)  until  new  elections  could  be  held. 

During  the  next  six  years  (a  period  known  as  the  Maximato), 
Calles  exercised  behind-the-scenes  control  over  Mexican  poli- 
tics through  the  actions  of  three  presidents  who  were  essen- 
tially his  puppets.  By  1929  Calles's  political  machine  had  found 


44 


Historical  Setting 


institutional  expression  as  the  National  Revolutionary  Party 
(Partido  Nacional  Revolucionario — PNR).  Unlike  previous  par- 
ties, which  existed  only  in  name  during  electoral  campaigns 
and  dissolved  immediately  thereafter,  the  PNR  was  designed  to 
be  a  permanent  organization  run  exclusively  by  Calles  as  jefe 
mdximo  (supreme  leader),  through  which  he  acted  as  de  facto 
president.  Henceforth,  the  "official"  party  of  the  revolutionary 
regime  served  as  the  dominant  political  organization  in  the 
country  and  the  primary  dispenser  of  official  patronage. 

In  the  special  election  of  1929,  called  to  select  a  figurehead 
to  serve  out  the  remaining  four  years  of  Obregon's  term,  Calles 
chose  Pascual  Ortiz  Rubio  as  the  PNR  candidate.  Ortiz  Rubio 
was  opposed  by  Jose  Vasconcelos,  who  decried  Calles's  thinly 
veiled  authoritarian  rule  and  the  growing  corruption  of  the 
older  revolutionary  generation.  Relying  on  ballot  stuffing  and 
other  forms  of  electoral  fraud,  Ortiz  Rubio  defeated  Vasconce- 
los with  99.9  percent  of  the  vote.  Ortiz  Rubio's  presidency 
would  be  short-lived,  however.  Having  demonstrated  excessive 
independence  from  Calles  once  in  office,  the  president  was 
summarily  removed  by  the  "supreme  leader"  in  September 
1932  and  replaced  with  a  more  compliant  figure,  Abelardo 
Rodriguez. 

The  last  two  years  of  the  Maximato  under  the  presidency  of 
Rodriguez  witnessed  a  steady  rightward  drift  of  the  revolution- 
ary regime.  Deciding  that  the  country  could  not  forego  agricul- 
tural productivity  for  the  sake  of  equity,  Calles  ordered  a  near 
halt  to  further  land  redistribution.  Organized  labor,  which  was 
seen  as  overly  sympathetic  to  bolshevism  and  not  loyal  enough 
to  the  PNR,  was  disavowed  and  suppressed.  By  the  early  1930s, 
the  government  was  persecuting  the  Mexican  Communist 
Party  and  allowing  fascist  organizations  to  terrorize  Mexico's 
small  Jewish  population. 

As  the  election  for  the  1934-40  presidential  sexenio 
approached,  Calles  came  under  increasing  pressure  from  the 
left  wing  of  the  PNR  to  pursue  with  more  vigor  the  social  wel- 
fare provisions  of  the  constitution  of  1917.  Seeking  to  avoid  a 
party  split,  Calles  mollified  his  party's  left  wing  by  nominating 
Lazaro  Cardenas,  a  popular  state  governor,  to  succeed 
Rodriguez.  Cardenas  had  participated  in  the  revolutionary 
conflict  as  a  constitutionalist  military  officer,  achieving  the 
rank  of  brigadier  general.  While  governor  of  his  home  state  of 
Michoacan,  Cardenas  gained  recognition  for  his  support  of 
public  education  and  his  good  relationship  with  organized 


45 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

labor  and  peasant  organizations.  Cardenas's  modest  efforts  at 
land  reform  at  the  state  level  earned  him  a  reputation  as  a  pop- 
ulist. Calles,  although  wary  of  Cardenas,  nevertheless  expected 
the  new  president  to  fall  into  line  much  as  his  three  predeces- 
sors had  done. 

Cardenismo  and  the  Revolution  Rekindled,  1934-40 

Cardenas  immediately  showed  his  independence  by  becom- 
ing the  first  Mexican  president  to  campaign  for  office.  Once  in 
office,  he  began  his  sexenio  by  adopting  several  popular  mea- 
sures. He  reduced  his  presidential  salary  and  decided  not  to 
move  into  the  national  palace,  he  ordered  a  resumption  of 
land  reform  on  an  unprecedented  scale,  and  he  expressed  tacit 
support  for  a  wave  of  urban  strikes.  Calles  followed  these  devel- 
opments with  unease,  and  soon  sought  to  undermine  the  new 
president's  authority.  A  definitive  break  occurred  between 
Calles  and  Cardenas  when  the  new  president  fired  many  of 
Calles's  followers  in  the  federal  bureaucracy  and  closed  down  a 
network  of  gambling  houses  owned  by  Calles's  associates.  It 
became  apparent  that  Calles  had  underestimated  Cardenas's 
commitment  to  reform  and  his  political  skills.  Calles's  open 
opposition  to  Cardenas  finally  earned  the  former  leader  forced 
exile  to  the  United  States  in  1936.  Conservatives  from  San  Luis 
Potosf  staged  a  rebellion  in  protest,  but  the  military  remained 
loyal  to  the  president  and  brought  the  revolt  under  control. 

Land  reform  was  one  of  Cardenas's  major  accomplishments. 
In  the  course  of  six  years,  he  distributed  almost  18  million  hec- 
tares— more  than  twice  as  much  land  as  all  of  his  predecessors 
combined — to  two-thirds  of  the  Mexican  peasantry  through 
the  system  of  communal  farms  or  ejidos  (see  Land  Tenure,  ch. 
3).  Even  though  agriculture  suffered  an  initial  setback  because 
of  the  loss  of  economies  of  scale  and  a  lack  of  resources  and 
credit,  the  redistribution  proved  tremendously  popular  with 
the  majority  of  the  Mexican  people  and  earned  Cardenas  a  spe- 
cial place  in  Mexican  history. 

Church  relations  also  improved  during  Cardenas's  presi- 
dency. Key  was  the  intervention  of  Luis  Maria  Martinez,  arch- 
bishop of  Mexico.  Martinez  encouraged  Roman  Catholics  to  be 
more  sensitive  to  the  social  and  economic  welfare  of  society, 
even  though  national  education  continued  to  be  secular  and 
had  become  socialist  in  its  emphasis.  The  labor  movement  also 
received  Cardenas's  attention.  The  president  supported 
Vicente  Lombardo  Toledano,  a  Marxist  who  reorganized  labor 


46

into  the  Confederation  of  Mexican  Workers  (Confederacion 
de  Trabajadores  Mexicanos — CTM).  The  old  CROM  had 
become  corrupt  through  the  years,  and  the  CTM  became  the 
new,  quasi-official  representative  of  Mexican  workers,  develop- 
ing programs  and  pushing  for  improvement  of  working  condi- 
tions and  minimum  wage  schedules  (see  Organized  Labor,  ch. 
4). 

Cardenas  also  reorganized  the  official  Mexican  party,  the 
PNR,  to  broaden  its  political  base.  The  party  was  renamed  the 
Party  of  the  Mexican  Revolution  (Partido  de  la  Revolucion 
Mexicana — PRM),  and  membership  expanded  to  include  rep- 
resentatives of  four  corporately  defined  "sectors"  of  Mexican 
society:  labor,  agrarian,  military,  and  popular.  The  agrarian  sec- 
tor consisted  of  peasants  and  rural  laborers,  and  the  popular 
sector  included  the  small  but  growing  middle  class,  civil  ser- 
vants, and  small-scale  merchants. 

Cardenas's  boldest  act  was  his  expropriation  in  March  1938 
of  all  foreign  oil  operations  on  Mexican  territory.  In  response 
to  a  strike  by  oil  workers  seeking  higher  wages,  the  government 
intervened  on  their  behalf,  demanding  that  the  mostly  United 
States-owned  companies  share  more  of  their  technical  and 
managerial  expertise  with  Mexican  nationals.  When  the  com- 
panies failed  to  comply  with  the  worker-training  demand, 
Cardenas  issued  his  sweeping  expropriation  of  all  foreign  oil 


47 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

operations.  Compensation  was  based  on  the  underreported 
"book"  value  of  the  properties.  The  expropriation,  which 
Cardenas  considered  a  natural  outcome  of  the  constitutional 
claim  to  national  ownership  of  all  subsoil  resources,  tempo- 
rarily disrupted  commerce  between  Mexico  and  the  United 
States.  Nationalization,  however,  won  Cardenas  widespread 
praise  both  within  Mexico  and  throughout  Latin  America, 
where  nationalist  sentiment  against  foreign  commercial  inter- 
ests ran  high. 

In  November  1941,  on  the  eve  of  United  States  entry  into 
World  War  II,  Mexico  and  the  United  States  finally  settled  their 
differences  over  the  expropriated  properties.  Although  it  was  a 
significant  political  victory  for  Cardenas,  the  oil  expropriation 
cost  Mexico  dearly  in  terms  of  capital  flight  and  foreign  invest- 
ment. For  nearly  twenty  years,  the  new  national  petroleum 
company,  Mexican  Petroleum  (Petroleos  Mexicanos — Pemex) 
suffered  from  inadequate  technical  expertise  and  outdated 
equipment. 

By  the  end  of  his  term  in  1940,  Cardenas  had  dramatically 
transformed  the  Mexican  political  system.  Continuing  the  leg- 
acy of  executive  predominance  begun  by  Calles,  Cardenas  fur- 
ther augmented  presidential  power  by  subordinating  the  entire 
apparatus  of  the  official  party  under  the  chief  executive.  In 
addition,  Cardenas  expanded  the  role  of  the  state  in  Mexican 
society,  establishing  patron-client  relationships  among  various 
state  agencies  and  the  corporately  defined  interest  groups.  The 
"institutionalization"  of  the  Revolution  resulted  in  a  situation 
in  which  the  state  became  the  sole  mediator  among  competing 
interest  groups  and  the  final  arbiter  of  political  disputes. 

From  Revolution  to  Governance,  1940-82 

Avila  Camacho's  Wartime  Presidency,  1940-46 

Cardenas's  nomination  of  Manuel  Avila  Camacho,  a  rela- 
tively unknown  career  military  officer,  as  the  PRM  candidate 
for  the  presidency  in  1940  surprised  many  Mexicans.  Numer- 
ous party  members  were  aware  of  Avila  Camacho's  conservative 
tendencies.  Moreover,  in  contrast  to  the  anticlerical  position 
held  by  most  Mexican  politicians  since  the  Revolution,  during 
the  presidential  campaign  Avila  Camacho  had  stated  that  he 
was  a  believer  and  a  Roman  Catholic.  The  new  president  took 
office  on  December  1,  1940,  and,  as  expected,  did  not  push  for 
enforcement  of  the  most  populist  articles  of  the  constitution.

Historical  Setting 


Land  reform  was  slowed  down,  and  its  emphasis  shifted  from 
reconstituting  ejidos  to  promoting  private  ownership  of  land. 

The  conservative  bent  of  the  new  administration  was  espe- 
cially evident  in  the  administration's  attitude  toward  labor. 
Fidel  Velasquez,  a  more  conservative  labor  leader,  replaced 
Lombardo  Toledano  as  head  of  the  CTM.  The  government 
withdrew  much  of  its  support  for  organized  labor,  and  controls 
were  placed  on  the  rights  of  strikers.  By  1942  the  CTM  had  lost 
textile  and  building  industry  workers,  who  felt  alienated  from 
the  new  leadership.  Although  the  Avila  Camacho  administra- 
tion created  the  Mexican  Institute  of  Social  Security  (Instituto 
Mexicano  del  Seguro  Social — IMSS),  the  program  initially  ben- 
efited only  a  small  portion  of  the  labor  force. 

Changes  were  also  apparent  in  education  as  the  Avila  Cama- 
cho administration  introduced  new  education  programs. 
Greater  emphasis  was  placed  on  private  schools,  and  the  gov- 
ernment started  a  campaign  that  encouraged  each  literate  citi- 
zen to  teach  another  person  to  read  and  write.  Launched  with 
much  fanfare,  the  impact  of  the  campaign  was  short-lived,  how- 
ever. 

Avila  Camacho's  administration  witnessed  the  expansion  of 
World  War  II  in  Europe.  Exercising  its  independence  from  the 
United  States,  Mexico  initially  attempted  to  remain  neutral 
after  the  United  States  entered  the  war  in  December  1941. 
However,  when  two  Mexican  tankers  were  sunk  by  German  sub- 
marines in  May  1942,  Mexico  declared  war  on  Germany.  The 
declaration  received  full  support  from  congress  and  most  of 
the  Mexican  population.  On  September  16,  1942,  several 
former  presidents  held  an  unprecedented  meeting  at  the 
National  Palace  for  a  public  display  of  solidarity  in  the  face  of 
war.  Those  present  included  former  presidents  de  la  Huerta, 
Calles,  Portes  Gil,  Ortiz  Rubio,  Rodriguez,  and  Cardenas.  A 
comprehensive  national  security  policy  was  developed  to 
counter  Axis  espionage  against  Mexico  and  to  defend  Mexican 
oil  fields  and  military  industries.  Mexico  participated  in  the 
war  effort  mainly  as  a  supplier  of  labor  and  raw  materials  for 
the  United  States,  although  a  Mexican  fighter  squadron  fought 
and  sustained  casualties  in  the  Pacific  theater. 

In  1942  the  Mexican  and  United  States  governments  negoti- 
ated a  program  to  enlist  migrant  Mexican  workers  ( braceros)  to 
assist  in  harvesting  United  States  crops.  The  program  was  ini- 
tially intended  to  supplement  the  depleted  rural  labor  force  in 
the  United  States,  who  had  been  displaced  by  the  war  effort.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

The  bracero  program,  which  continued  into  the  1960s,  subse- 
quently lured  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Mexican  laborers  with 
and  without  legal  documentation  to  seek  employment  across 
the  border. 

By  early  1946,  the  PRM's  political  power  base  included  new 
groups  in  Mexican  society.  The  party  now  had  representatives 
of  the  business  and  industrial  communities  within  its  popular 
sector.  As  a  sign  that  the  official  party  viewed  the  transitional 
phase  of  the  Revolution  as  ended,  officials  decided  to  rename 
the  party  the  Institutional  Revolutionary  Party  (Partido  Revolu- 
cionario  Institucional — PRI).  The  same  January  1946  conven- 
tion nominated  Miguel  Aleman  Valdes  to  be  the  PRI  candidate 
for  the  presidential  term  of  1946-52. 

The  Aleman  Sexenio,  1946-52 

The  Aleman  presidency  marked  a  turning  point  in  contem- 
porary Mexican  politics.  With  the  election  of  Aleman  (a  lawyer 
by  profession),  the  torch  was  passed  to  a  new  generation  of 
civilian  politicians  who  had  not  participated  in  the  military 
campaigns  of  the  Revolution.  The  age  of  the  generals  in  Mexi- 
can politics  was  over.  Henceforth,  the  military  assumed  a  low 
profile,  surrendering  many  of  its  institutional  prerogatives  to  a 
civilian-dominated  PRI. 

Aleman's  presidency  was  also  noteworthy  because  it  repre- 
sented the  consolidation  in  power  of  a  PRI  faction  that  was 
more  probusiness  and  less  nationalistic  than  the  Cardenas  wing 
of  the  party.  One  of  Aleman's  first  acts  as  president  was  to  reaf- 
firm amicable  postwar  relations  between  Mexico  and  the 
United  States.  In  a  symbolic  gesture  of  rapprochement,  United 
States  President  Harry  S  Truman  and  President  Aleman  visited 
each  other's  countries.  On  September  2,  1947,  Mexico  was 
among  the  signatories  of  the  Inter-American  Treaty  of  Recipro- 
cal Assistance  (Rio  Treaty),  which  outlined  a  system  of  mutual 
defense  on  the  part  of  Western  Hemisphere  nations  against 
outside  aggression. 

The  Aleman  administration  attempted  to  promote  industri- 
alization and  economic  growth  by  embarking  on  an  extensive 
program  of  infrastructure  improvements.  Major  flood  control 
and  irrigation  projects  were  built  in  northern  Mexico,  greatly 
expanding  the  opportunities  for  large-scale  agribusiness.  The 
exploitation  of  cheap  hydroelectric  power  and  the  expansion 
of  the  national  road  network  were  undertaken  to  help  spur 
heavy  industry  and  tourism.  By  the  end  of  Aleman's  sexenio  in 


50 


Historical  Setting 


1952,  Mexico  had  four  times  as  many  kilometers  of  paved  roads 
(roughly  16,000  kilometers)  as  in  1946.  Another  legacy  of  the 
Aleman  era  was  the  completion  in  1952  of  a  new  campus — in 
what  was  then  suburban  Mexico  City — for  the  flagship  of  the 
Mexican  university  system,  the  National  Autonomous  Univer- 
sity of  Mexico  (Universidad  Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico — 
UNAM). 

Aleman  was  viewed  as  much  less  sympathetic  than  his  imme- 
diate predecessors  to  the  demands  of  labor  and  the  rural  popu- 
lations of  central  and  southern  Mexico.  To  promote  growth 
without  generating  high  inflation,  the  government  acted 
through  the  PRI-afnTiated  unions  to  suppress  the  wage 
demands  of  labor.  The  government  also  began  a  new  strategy 
of  "stabilizing  development."  The  new  program  was  based  on 
promoting  industrialization  through  import  substitution  (see 
Glossary),  heavy  subsidies  of  industry,  and  maintaining  low 
inflation  by  suppressing  real  wages. 

Further  straying  from  the  ideals  of  the  Revolution,  Aleman's 
administration  became  noted  for  its  tolerance  of  official  cor- 
ruption. The  government's  growing  involvement  in  the  econ- 
omy provided  ample  opportunities  for  kickbacks  and  other 
forms  of  illicit  enrichment,  and  several  senior  government  offi- 
cials became  wealthy  while  in  office.  The  scale  of  official  venal- 
ity was  enough  to  spark  a  public  outcry  and  protests  from 
within  the  PRI.  To  restore  popular  faith  in  the  ruling  party,  Ale- 
man nominated  Adolfo  Ruiz  Cortines,  a  former  governor  of 
Veracruz,  minister  of  interior,  and  a  man  noted  for  his  impec- 
cable character,  to  succeed  him  in  1952. 

The  Ruiz  Cortines  Sexenio,  1952-58 

Despite  his  friendship  with  Aleman,  Ruiz  Cortines  set  out  to 
eliminate  the  corruption  and  graft  that  had  tainted  the  previ- 
ous administration.  In  his  inaugural  speech  on  December  1, 
1952,  Ruiz  Cortines  promised  to  require  complete  honesty 
from  officials  in  his  government  and  asked  that  they  make  pub- 
lic their  financial  assets.  He  later  fired  several  officials  on 
charges  of  corruption. 

The  economy  continued  to  grow  with  government  support. 
The  government,  for  example,  devaluated  the  peso  (Mex$ — 
for  value,  see  Glossary),  a  move  that  helped  to  encourage  inves- 
tors from  abroad.  Ruiz  Cortines  did  not  promote  a  new  con- 
struction boom  but  rather  channeled  money  into  public  health 
programs.  The  IMSS,  under  the  directorship  of  Antonio  Ortiz 


51 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Mena,  was  expanded  to  provide  medical  services  at  hospitals 
and  clinics  throughout  the  country,  and  a  more  comprehen- 
sive system  of  benefits  for  eligible  workers  and  their  families 
was  created. 

By  the  end  of  Ruiz  Cortines's  sexenio  in  1958,  three  consecu- 
tive administrations  had  pursued  probusiness  policies  that 
departed  significantly  from  the  agrarian  populism  practiced  by 
Cardenas.  Import-substitution  industrialization  had  generated 
rapid  growth  in  urban  areas,  while  land  reform  was  scaled  back 
and  redefined  to  emphasize  individual  private  farming.  Mean- 
while, Mexico's  population  more  than  doubled  in  less  than 
thirty  years,  from  16  million  in  the  mid-1950s  to  34  million  in 
1960.  The  resulting  population  pressure,  as  well  as  the  concen- 
tration of  services  and  new  jobs  in  urban  areas,  encouraged 
massive  urban  migration — most  notably  in  and  around  Mexico 
City.  The  proliferation  of  urban  shantytowns  in  the  capital's 
outskirts  became  a  growing  symbol  of  the  imbalance  between 
urban  and  rural  development  in  postwar  Mexico. 

With  wartime  calls  for  unity  and  austerity  now  well  past,  the 
Cardenas  faction  of  the  PRI  reemerged  as  a  powerful  force  act- 
ing on  behalf  of  the  party's  core  agrarian  and  labor  constituen- 
cies. Former  President  Cardenas  (who  continued  to  wield 
considerable  influence  in  national  politics)  persuaded  the 
party  to  nominate  one  of  his  followers,  Adolfo  Lopez  Mateos, 
as  the  PRI  candidate  for  the  1958  presidential  election. 

Lopez  Mateos  and  the  Return  to  Revolutionary  Policies,  1958- 
64 

The  election  of  Lopez  Mateos  to  the  presidency  in  August 
1958  restored  to  power  the  PRI  faction  that  had  historically 
emphasized  nationalism  and  redistribution  of  land.  As  in  past 
elections,  the  PRI  won  handily  over  the  conservative  candidate 
of  the  opposition  National  Action  Party  (Partido  de  Accion 
National — PAN)  with  an  overwhelming  90  percent  of  the  vote. 
Although  the  PRI  regularly  engaged  in  vote  buying  and  fraud 
at  the  state  and  local  levels,  presidential  races  were  not  credibly 
contested  by  the  opposition,  and  little  interference  was 
required  to  keep  the  official  party  in  office.  Although  the  1958 
election  was  the  first  in  which  women  were  able  to  vote  for  the 
president,  the  enfranchisement  of  women  did  not  significantly 
affect  the  outcome  of  the  presidential  race. 

Lopez  Mateos  was  widely  viewed  as  the  political  heir  of 
Cardenas,  whose  nationalism  and  social  welfare  programs  had 


52 


Historical  Setting 


left  a  lasting  impact  on  Mexican  political  culture.  After  nearly 
two  decades  of  urban  bias  in  government  policy,  Lopez  Mateos 
took  tentative  steps  to  redress  the  imbalance  between  urban 
and  rural  Mexico.  His  administration  distributed  more  than  12 
million  hectares  of  land  to  ejidos  and  family  farmers  and  made 
available  new  land  for  small-scale  cultivation  in  southern 
Mexico.  In  addition,  the  IMSS  program  was  introduced  into 
rural  areas,  and  major  public  health  campaigns  were  launched 
to  reduce  tuberculosis,  poliomyelitis,  and  malaria. 

Whereas  the  government  regained  much  of  the  support  of 
agrarian  interests,  Lopez  Mateos's  relations  with  organized 
labor  were  strained.  As  Ruiz  Cortines's  labor  minister,  Lopez 
Mateos  had  gained  a  reputation  for  fairness  and  competence 
in  the  settlement  of  labor  disputes.  As  president,  however,  he 
opposed  the  growing  radicalization  and  militancy  among  ele- 
ments of  organized  labor  and  acted  forcefully  to  put  down  sev- 
eral major  strikes.  Reflecting  a  growing  ideological  polarization 
of  national  politics,  the  government  imprisoned  several  promi- 
nent communists,  including  the  famed  muralist  David  Alfaro 
Siqueiros.  Relations  between  labor  and  the  government  eased 
somewhat  in  1962,  when  Lopez  Mateos  revived  a  constitutional 
provision  that  called  for  labor  to  share  in  the  profits  of  large 
firms. 

Following  Cardenas's  example,  Lopez  Mateos  restored  a 
strongly  nationalist  tone  to  Mexican  foreign  policy,  albeit  not 
with  the  fervor  that  had  characterized  his  populist  predecessor. 
In  1960  the  government  began  to  buy  foreign  utility  conces- 
sions (as  opposed  to  expropriating  them,  as  Cardenas  had 
done).  Some  of  the  larger  companies  bought  were  Electric 
Industries  (Impulsora  de  Empresas  Electricas)  (from  the  Amer- 
ican and  Foreign  Power  Company  of  the  United  States),  Mexi- 
can Light  and  Power  Company  (from  a  Belgian  firm),  and 
Mexican  Electric  Company  (Industria  Electrica  Mexicana) 
(from  the  United  States-based  California  Power  Company). 
The  film  industry,  previously  owned  by  United  States  firms,  was 
also  brought  under  Mexican  control.  Mexican  nationalism  was 
most  evident  in  its  response  to  United  States-led  efforts  to  iso- 
late the  communist  regime  of  Fidel  Castro  Ruz  in  Cuba.  Alone 
among  the  members  of  the  Organization  of  American  States 
(OAS),  Mexico  refused  to  break  diplomatic  relations  with 
Cuba  or  to  observe  the  hemispheric  embargo  of  the  island 
approved  at  the  OAS's  Punta  del  Este  Conference  in  1962  (see 
Foreign  Relations,  ch.  4).

Authoritarianism  Unveiled,  1964-70 

By  choosing  his  minister  of  interior,  Gustavo  Diaz  Ordaz,  to 
succeed  him,  Lopez  Mateos  yielded  to  growing  concerns  within 
the  PRI  about  maintaining  internal  order  and  spurring  eco- 
nomic growth.  As  government  minister,  Diaz  Ordaz  had  been 
responsible  for  some  very  controversial  policy  decisions, 
including  the  arrest  of  Siqueiros,  the  violent  suppression  of  sev- 
eral strikes,  and  the  annulment  of  local  elections  in  Baja  Cali- 
fornia Sur,  in  which  the  PAN  had  received  most  of  the  votes. 

Business  interests  once  again  received  priority,  and  students 
and  labor  were  kept  under  control  so  as  not  to  disrupt  eco- 
nomic growth.  Antigovernment  protests  reached  unprece- 
dented proportions,  however,  in  the  demonstrations  of  the 
summer  of  1968,  just  prior  to  the  Summer  Olympic  Games  that 
were  to  be  held  in  Mexico  City  in  October.  From  July  through 
October,  academic  life  in  the  city  and  throughout  Mexico  was 
halted  as  students  rioted.  The  antigovernment  demonstrations 
were  ignited  by  student  grievances,  but  many  discontented  sec- 
tors of  society  joined  the  students. 

As  the  Olympic  Games  approached,  the  PRI  and  Diaz  Ordaz 
were  preparing  the  country  to  show  foreign  visitors  that 
Mexico  was  politically  stable  and  economically  sound.  Student 
unrest  grew  louder  and  more  violent,  however.  Student 
demands  included  freedom  for  all  political  prisoners,  dismissal 
of  the  police  chief,  disbanding  of  the  antiriot  police,  guaran- 
tees of  university  autonomy,  and  the  repeal  of  the  "law  of  social 
dissolution"  (regulating  the  punishment  of  acts  of  subversion, 
treason,  and  disorder).  Luis  Echeverna  Alvarez,  the  new  inte- 
rior minister,  agreed  to  discuss  the  issues  with  the  students  but 
changed  his  mind  when  they  demanded  that  the  meeting  be 
televised.  The  students,  their  demands  unmet,  escalated  the 
scale  and  frequency  of  their  protests.  In  late  August,  they  con- 
vened the  largest  antigovernment  demonstration  to  date,  rally- 
ing an  estimated  500,000  protesters  in  the  main  plaza  of  the 
capital.  Seeking  to  bring  a  halt  to  the  demonstrations,  Diaz 
Ordaz  ordered  the  army  to  take  control  of  UNAM  and  to  arrest 
the  student  movement  leaders. 

To  show  that  they  had  not  been  silenced,  the  students  called 
for  another  rally  at  the  Plaza  of  the  Three  Cultures  in  Mexico 
City's  Tlatelolco  district.  On  October  2,  1968,  a  crowd  of  about 
5,000  convened  on  the  plaza  in  defiance  of  the  government 
crackdown.  Armed  military  units  and  tanks  arrived  on  the 
scene  and  surrounded  the  demonstrators,  while  military  heli- 


54 


Historical  Setting 


copters  hovered  menacingly  overhead.  The  helicopters  began 
to  agitate  the  crowd  by  dropping  flares  into  the  densely  packed 
gathering.  Shortly  thereafter,  shots  rang  out  (according  to 
some  accounts,  the  shooting  was  started  by  the  military,  while 
others  claim  the  first  shots  were  fired  at  soldiers  by  antigovern- 
ment  snipers  in  the  surrounding  buildings).  The  panicked 
crowd  suddenly  surged  toward  the  military  cordon,  which 
reacted  by  shooting  and  bayoneting  indiscriminately  into  the 
crowd.  Estimates  of  the  number  of  people  killed  ranged  from 
several  dozen  to  more  than  400.  Despite  the  violence,  the 
Olympic  Games  proceeded  on  schedule.  However,  the  Tlate- 
lolco  massacre  had  a  profound  and  lasting  negative  effect  on 
the  PRI's  public  image.  The  authoritarian  aspects  of  the  politi- 
cal system  had  been  starkly  brought  to  the  surface. 

Reconciliation  and  Redistribution,  1970-76 

Despite  the  groundswell  of  urban  protest  unleashed  against 
the  government,  the  PRI  candidate  easily  won  the  1970  presi- 
dential election.  The  new  president,  Echeverria,  was  expected 
to  continue  his  predecessor's  policies.  Contrary  to  expecta- 
tions, however,  once  in  office  Echeverria  swung  the  ideological 
pendulum  of  the  regime  back  to  the  left.  The  government 
embarked  on  an  ambitious  public  relations  campaign  to  regain 
the  loyalty  of  leftist  intellectuals  and  the  young.  To  solidify  the 
support  of  its  core  labor  and  agrarian  constituencies,  the  PRI 
also  launched  a  barrage  of  social  welfare  programs. 

Echeverria  was  determined  to  coopt  the  dissatisfied  ele- 
ments of  the  middle  class  that  had  become  radicalized  during 
the  1960s.  Government  patronage  became  an  important  mech- 
anism of  rapprochement.  Thousands  of  intellectuals  and 
young  leftists  were  given  posts  in  the  government's  bloated 
bureaucracy,  and  prominent  student  leaders  were  brought  into 
the  president's  cabinet.  To  attract  support  from  the  young — 
who  now  represented  a  majority  of  the  population — Echeverria 
lowered  the  voting  age  to  eighteen,  and  the  ages  for  election  to 
the  Senate  and  Chamber  of  Deputies  to  thirty  and  twenty-one, 
respectively.  In  addition,  he  freed  most  of  the  demonstrators 
arrested  during  the  raid  on  UNAM  and  the  Tlatelolco  massa- 
cre. 

Despite  his  aversion  to  domestic  communist  movements, 
Echeverria  became  a  champion  of  leftist  causes  in  Latin  Amer- 
ica. He  was  a  strong  advocate  of  the  proposed  "new  interna- 
tional economic  order"  to  redistribute  power  and  wealth  more 


55 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

equitably  between  the  industrialized  countries  and  the  devel- 
oping world.  Demonstrating  his  independence  from  the 
United  States,  Echeverna  became  only  the  second  Latin  Amer- 
ican head  of  state  to  visit  Castro's  Cuba.  In  1974  he  warmly 
received  Hortensia  Allende,  widow  of  leftist  Chilean  president 
Salvador  Allende  Gossens,  as  a  political  refugee  from  Chile's 
right-wing  military  dictatorship. 

In  domestic  economic  affairs,  the  Echeverna  administration 
ended  the  policies  of  stabilizing  development  that  had  been 
pursued  since  the  early  1950s.  Echeverna  abandoned  Mexico's 
commitment  to  growth  with  low  inflation  and  undertook 
instead  to  stimulate  the  economy  and  redistribute  wealth 
through  massive  public-spending  programs.  The  new  policy  of 
"shared  development"  was  premised  on  heavy  state  investment 
in  the  economy  and  the  promotion  of  consumption  and  social 
welfare  for  the  middle  and  lower  classes. 

The  focus  of  Echeverna's  social  welfare  policies  was  the  Mex- 
ican countryside.  Despite  ample  evidence  that  the  ejidos  were 
less  efficient  than  private  farming,  Echeverna  resumed  the 
redistribution  of  land  to  ejidos  and  expanded  credit  subsidies  to 
cooperative  agriculture.  The  government  also  pursued  an 
extensive  program  of  rural  development  that  increased  the 
number  of  schools  and  health  clinics  in  rural  communities.  By 
refusing  to  defend  rural  property  owners  from  squatters,  the 
Echeverna  government  encouraged  a  wave  of  land  invasions 
that  reduced  land  pressure  in  the  countryside  but  seriously 
undermined  investor  confidence. 

In  addition  to  providing  broad  subsidies  for  agriculture,  the 
government  embarked  on  several  costly  infrastructure  projects, 
such  as  the  US$1  billion  Lazaro  Cardenas-Las  Truchas  Steel 
Plant  (Sicartsa)  steel  complex  in  Michoacan  state.  State  subsi- 
dies to  stimulate  private  and  parastatal  (see  Glossary)  invest- 
ment grew  from  16  billion  pesos  (US$1.2  billion)  in  1970  to 
428  billion  pesos  (US$18.6  billion)  by  1980.  Although  this  type 
of  spending  generated  high  economic  growth  throughout  the 
1970s,  much  of  the  money  was  either  wasted  in  unnecessary 
and  inefficient  projects  or  lost  to  corruption.  The  government 
relied  heavily  on  deficit  spending  to  finance  its  domestic  pro- 
grams, incurring  heavy  debt  obligations  with  foreign  creditors 
to  make  up  the  shortfall  in  public  revenues. 

Under  Echeverna,  the  historically  uneasy  relationship 
between  the  PRI  and  the  national  business  community  took  a 
sharp  turn  for  the  worse.  Echeverna's  antibusiness  rhetoric  and

the  government's  interference  in  the  economy  deterred  new 
foreign  and  domestic  investment.  Although  the  government 
avoided  full-scale  expropriations,  it  increased  the  state's  role  in 
the  economy  by  buying  out  private  shareholders  and  assuming 
control  of  hundreds  of  domestic  enterprises.  By  the  end  of 
Echeverria's  term,  the  government  owned  significant  shares  in 
more  than  1,000  corporations  nationwide. 

Despite  warning  signs  of  a  looming  financial  crisis,  deficit 
spending  continued  unabated  throughout  Echeverria's  sexenio. 
The  public  sector's  foreign  debt  rose  by  450  percent  to 
US$19.6  billion  in  six  years,  while  the  peso  was  allowed  to 
become  overvalued.  By  the  end  of  his  sexenio,  Echeverria  was 
facing  the  consequences  of  his  administration's  unrestrained 
spending.  In  August  1976,  mounting  currency  speculation, 
large-scale  capital  flight,  and  lack  of  confidence  in  Mexico's 
ability  to  meet  its  debt  repayment  schedule  forced  the  govern- 
ment to  devalue  the  peso  for  the  first  time  since  1954.  The  out- 
going president  bequeathed  to  his  successor,  Jose  Lopez 
Portillo  y  Pacheco,  an  economy  in  recession  and  burdened  by 
severe  structural  imbalances.  The  only  bright  spot  in  an  other- 
wise bleak  economic  picture  was  the  discovery  in  the  mid-1970s 
of  vast  reserves  of  oil  under  the  Bahia  de  Campeche  and  in  the 
states  of  Chiapas  and  Tabasco. 

Recovery  and  Relapse,  1 976-82 

President  Lopez  Portillo  was  inaugurated  on  December  1, 
1976,  amid  a  political  and  economic  crisis  inherited  from  the 
previous  administration.  A  rising  foreign  debt  and  inflation 
rate,  a  55  percent  currency  devaluation,  and  a  general  climate 
of  economic  uncertainty  that  had  spurred  capital  flight 
plagued  the  economy.  The  new  administration  also  faced  a 
general  lack  of  confidence  in  government  institutions.  Unex- 
pected help  arrived  as  a  result  of  the  confirmation  of  the  large 
oil  reserves.  The  Mexican  government  chose  to  follow  a  policy 
of  increasing  oil  production  only  gradually  to  prevent  an  infla- 
tionary spiral  that  would  disrupt  economic  recovery.  Neverthe- 
less, by  1981  Mexico  had  become  the  fourth  largest  producer 
of  oil  in  the  world,  its  production  having  tripled  between  1976 
and  1982.  While  production  increased,  so  did  the  price  per 
barrel  of  crude  oil. 

The  immense  revenues  generated  by  oil  exports  during  the 
administration  of  Lopez  Portillo  gave  Mexico  a  greater  degree 
of  confidence  in  international  affairs,  particularly  in  its  ever

important  relations  with  the  United  States.  The  government, 
for  example,  refused  to  participate  in  the  United  States-led 
boycott  of  the  1980  Summer  Olympic  Games  in  Moscow.  When 
the  two  countries  could  not  agree  on  the  price  of  natural  gas, 
Mexico  flared  its  excess  resources  rather  than  sell  to  the  United 
States  below  its  asking  price.  Also  in  defiance  of  United  States 
wishes,  Mexico  recognized  the  Farabundo  Marti  National  Lib- 
eration Front  rebels  in  El  Salvador  as  a  representative  political 
force.  These  steps  occurred  although  the  United  States 
remained  Mexico's  major  oil  customer  and  its  major  source  of 
investment  capital  (see  Petroleum,  ch.  3;  Foreign  Relations,  ch. 
4). 

As  in  so  many  developing  countries,  oil  did  not  solve  all  of 
Mexico's  problems,  however.  The  oil  industry  grew  rapidly  but 
could  not  employ  the  ever-increasing  ranks  of  the  unskilled. 
Oil  made  Mexico  a  rich  nation  in  which  a  majority  of  the  peo- 
ple continued  to  live  in  poverty.  Foreign  banks  and  the  interna- 
tional lending  agencies,  seeing  Mexico  as  a  secure  investment 
with  abundant  energy  resources,  flooded  the  country  with 
loans  that  kept  the  peso  overvalued. 

"The  Crisis"  Begins,  1982 

Although  its  effects  rippled  through  every  aspect  of  national 
life,  the  roots  of  what  came  to  be  known  simply  as  "the  crisis" 
were  exclusively  economic.  The  roots  of  the  crisis  lay  in  the  oil 
boom  of  the  late  1970s.  Oil  prices  rose  sharply  at  a  time  when 
oil  exploration  in  Mexico  was  at  a  peak.  The  nation  found  itself 
awash  in  petrodollars.  Its  infrastructure,  barely  adequate 
before  the  boom,  was  overwhelmed  by  the  influx  of  imported 
goods  that  followed  Mexico's  rising  foreign  exchange  reserves 
and  the  overvalued  peso.  Lopez  Portillo  promised  "to  trans- 
form nonrenewable  resources  into  renewable  wealth."  In  other 
words,  he  vowed  to  invest  substantial  amounts  of  the  new  oil 
revenue  in  areas  and  projects  that  would  establish  sustainable 
economic  growth.  This  promise  went  unfulfilled. 

Government  spending  did  increase  substantially  following 
the  oil  boom.  Little,  if  any,  of  the  new  spending,  however,  qual- 
ified as  productive  investment.  Food  subsidies,  long  a  political 
necessity  in  Mexico,  accounted  for  the  largest  single  portion  of 
the  new  spending.  Although  impossible  to  quantify,  many 
accounts  agree  that  the  level  of  graft  and  corruption  skyrock- 
eted. The  new  money  fueled  a  level  of  inflation  never  before 
seen  in  modern  Mexico;  the  inflation  rate  eventually  surpassed 


58 


Historical  Setting 


100  percent  annually.  The  Lopez  Portillo  administration  chose 
to  ignore  warning  signs  of  inflation  and  opted  instead  to 
increase  spending. 

The  macroeconomic  trends  that  preceded  the  crisis  also  dis- 
played warning  signs  that  went  unheeded.  Oil  income  rose 
from  1979  to  1980.  Oil  exports  began  to  crowd  out  other 
exports;  the  petroleum  sector  accounted  for  45  percent  of  total 
exports  in  1979,  but  dominated  exports  with  65.4  percent  of 
the  total  in  the  second  quarter  of  1980.  Like  so  many  other 
developing  nations,  Mexico  became  a  single-commodity 
exporter.  With  almost  50  billion  barrels  in  proven  reserves 
serving  as  collateral,  Mexico  also  became  a  major  international 
borrower.  Significant  foreign  borrowing  began  under  Presi- 
dent Echeverna,  but  it  soared  under  Lopez  Portillo.  Foreign 
banks  proved  just  as  shortsighted  as  the  Mexican  government, 
approving  large  loans  in  the  belief  that  oil  revenue  expansion 
would  continue  over  the  terms  of  the  loans,  assuring  repay- 
ment. Hydrocarbon  earnings  for  the  period  from  1977  to  1982, 
US$48  billion,  were  almost  matched  by  public-sector  external 
borrowing  over  the  same  period,  which  totaled  US$40  billion. 
By  1982  almost  45  percent  of  export  earnings  went  to  service 
the  country's  external  debt. 

Living  standards  had  already  begun  to  decline  when  the  oil 
glut  hit  in  1981.  Although  the  economy  grew  by  an  average  of  6 
percent  per  year  from  1977  to  1979,  purchasing  power  over 
that  period  dropped  by  6.5  percent.  By  mid-1981,  overproduc- 
tion had  softened  the  international  oil  market  considerably.  In 
July  the  government  announced  that  it  needed  to  borrow 
US$1.2  billion  to  compensate  for  lost  oil  revenue.  The  month 
before,  Pemex  had  reduced  its  sales  price  for  crude  oil  on  the 
international  market  by  US$4  per  barrel.  Continued  high 
import  levels  and  the  drop  in  oil  exports  had  boosted  Mexico's 
current  account  deficit  to  US$10  billion.  This  uncertain  situa- 
tion— high  external  debt,  stagnant  exports,  and  a  devalued 
currency  as  of  February  1982 — prompted  investors  to  pull  their 
money  out  of  Mexico  and  seek  safer  havens  abroad.  This 
action,  in  turn,  led  Lopez  Portillo  to  nationalize  the  banks  in 
September  1982  in  an  effort  to  staunch  wounds  that  were 
largely  of  his  own  making. 

Lopez  Portillo  left  office  in  1982  a  discredited  figure,  in  no 
small  part  because  the  press  publicized  accounts  of  his  luxuri- 
ous lifestyle.  The  Mexican  public,  long-suffering  and  pragmatic 
in  political  matters,  found  Lopez  Portillo's  calls  for  "sacrifice"

and  austerity  unacceptable  when  contrasted  with  his  own  life- 
style. 

To  the  Brink  and  Back,  1982-88 

The  de  la  Madrid  Sexenio,  1 982-88 

When  he  took  office  in  December  1982,  Miguel  de  la  Madrid 
Hurtado  faced  domestic  conditions  arguably  more  serious  than 
those  confronting  any  postrevolutionary  president.  The  for- 
eign debt  had  reached  new  heights,  the  gross  national  product 
(GNP —  see  Glossary)  was  contracting  rather  than  growing, 
inflation  had  hit  100  percent  annually,  and  the  peso  had  lost  40 
percent  of  its  value.  Moreover,  and  perhaps  most  critical,  the 
Mexican  people  had  begun  to  question  and  criticize  the  system 
of  one-party  rule  that  had  caused  this  situation.  Abroad,  com- 
mentators (including  United  States  president  Ronald  W. 
Reagan)  speculated  as  to  the  potential  for  revolutionary 
upheaval  in  what  had  been  considered  a  stable,  if  not  demo- 
cratic, southern  neighbor.  Some  Mexicans  shared  this  concern. 
The  government  and  most  in  the  PRI,  de  la  Madrid  included, 
believed  that  they  could  continue  to  hold  power  by  keeping  the 
people  well  fed  and  reversing  economic  trends. 

Hand-picked  by  Lopez  Portillo,  de  la  Madrid  inherited  the 
former  president's  economic  mismanagement  and  that  of  sev- 
eral of  his  predecessors.  Lack  of  fiscal  restraint,  encouraged  by 
a  sudden  flood  of  oil  wealth,  lay  at  the  root  of  the  crisis.  Over- 
printing of  the  peso  cheapened  the  currency,  fed  inflation,  and 
exacerbated  rather  than  cured  the  economic  sins  that 
prompted  it.  And  corruption,  the  traditional  parasite  of  eco- 
nomic vitality  in  Mexico,  made  its  contribution  to  the  crash. 

Although  weak  compared  with  earlier  presidents,  de  la 
Madrid  still  wielded  formidable  power  in  both  the  economic 
and  political  arenas.  The  day  of  his  inauguration,  he  recog- 
nized the  nation's  "emergency  situation"  by  instituting  a  sweep- 
ing program  of  economic  austerity  measures.  The  ten-point 
program  included  federal  budget  cuts,  new  taxes,  price 
increases  on  some  previously  subsidized  items,  postponement 
of  many  scheduled  public  works  projects,  increases  in  some 
interest  rates,  and  the  relaxation  of  foreign-  exchange  controls 
enacted  during  the  waning  days  of  the  Lopez  Portillo  adminis- 
tration. Aside  from  its  anticipated  adverse  impact  on  the  stan- 
dard of  living,  many  Mexicans  resented  the  program  for  other 
reasons.  Nationalists  saw  the  measures  as  inspired  and  all  but 


60 


Historical  Setting 


imposed  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glos- 
sary), which  reportedly  had  taken  a  hard  line  in  debt  talks  with 
the  government.  Others  resented  the  austerity  edicts  because 
they  believed  that  the  government  and  the  PRI  had  brought 
the  nation  to  the  brink  of  ruin,  but  that  the  people  would  have 
to  bear  the  burden  of  official  incompetence. 

The  sudden  reversal  of  a  long  trend  of  steady  economic 
growth  in  Mexico  threw  the  political  system  into  turmoil, 
undermined  the  authority  of  the  PRI,  and  raised  the  already 
high  levels  of  popular  skepticism.  Economic  austerity  exacer- 
bated the  elitist  aspect  of  the  populist  authoritarian  system  that 
developed  after  the  Revolution.  Conditions  such  as  inflation, 
devaluation,  and  the  withdrawal  of  subsidies  hit  the  poor  hard- 
est. The  wealthy  found  ways  to  insulate  themselves  from  such 
developments;  as  a  result,  the  rich  grew  richer.  This  was  true 
both  within  the  private  sector  and  among  the  bureaucracy.  In 
addition  to  the  schism  between  the  poor  and  the  rich,  the  crisis 
and  its  impact  on  the  PRI's  authority  sharpened  the  long- 
standing dichotomy  between  central  and  southern  Mexico  and 
the  north.  The  immediate  political  beneficiary  of  the  crisis  was 
the  PAN,  a  conservative,  probusiness  party  with  its  roots  in  the 
northern  border  states. 

To  counteract  the  ferment,  the  government  decided  to  allow 
some  opening  of  the  political  system — enough  to  provide  a 
safety  valve  for  public  discontent — but  not  enough  to  threaten 
the  PRI's  control,  a  balance  difficult  to  attain.  The  first  volley  in 
the  campaign  against  the  PRI  and  its  policies  came  with  the 
elections  of  July  3,  1983.  Although  the  PRI  took  a  large  major- 
ity of  municipal  and  state  legislative  races  in  five  northern 
states,  the  PAN  captured  an  unprecedented  nine  mayoralties 
and  registered  gains  in  all  five  state  legislatures. 

In  addition  to  the  economic  and  political  arenas,  de  la 
Madrid  sought  to  exert  influence  in  the  area  of  ethics.  Early  in 
his  administration,  the  president  announced  a  program  of 
"moral  renewal."  Despite  its  high-minded  rhetoric,  the  pro- 
gram never  enacted  major  legislation  to  discourage  corrupt 
practices.  One  exception  was  a  new  rule  that  eliminated  gov- 
ernment subcontracting,  a  device  that  union  leaders  often 
used  to  earn  kickbacks  from  contractors.  In  addition  to  institut- 
ing this  new  rule,  the  moral  renewal  campaign  chose  to  make 
examples  of  a  handful  of  corrupt  officials,  including  former 
Pemex  director  Jorge  Diaz  Serrano  and  former  Mexico  City

police  chief  Arturo  Durazo  Moreno,  both  of  whom  served 
prison  sentences  for  illegal  personal  gain. 

The  United  States  and  the  Crisis  in  Mexico 

Historically,  United  States  relations  with  Mexico  have  fol- 
lowed a  reactive  pattern  of  neglect,  activism,  and  intervention. 
The  crisis  of  the  1980s,  which  appeared  to  threaten  the  long- 
standing stability  of  Mexico,  triggered  a  new  period  of  activist 
attention  to  its  southern  neighbor  by  the  United  States.  The 
prospect  of  an  economically  overextended  Mexico  defaulting 
on  US$100  billion  in  foreign  loans  caused  alarm  in  Washington 
and  throughout  the  industrialized  world.  The  possibility  of 
resulting  political  upheaval  was  particularly  worrying  to  the 
United  States.  As  a  result,  other  lesser  issues  between  the  two 
countries — migration,  drugs,  environmental  concerns,  invest- 
ment, and  trade — received  increased  attention. 

United  States  president  Reagan,  a  former  governor  of  Cali- 
fornia, brought  to  the  White  House  an  appreciation  of  the 
importance  of  the  relationship  between  the  two  countries. 
Reagan  met  with  President  Lopez  Portillo  in  Ciudad  Juarez  on 
January  5,  1981,  becoming  the  first  United  States  president- 
elect to  visit  Mexico.  One  of  the  topics  that  the  two  leaders  dis- 
cussed in  Ciudad  Juarez  was  the  political  crisis  in  Central  Amer- 
ica, where  the  leftist  Sandinista  National  Liberation  Front 
(Frente  Sandinista  de  Liberacion  Nacional — FSLN),  also 
known  as  Sandinistas  (see  Glossary),  held  power  in  Nicaragua 
and  supported  guerrilla  movements  in  El  Salvador  and  Guate- 
mala. Lopez  Portillo  reportedly  cautioned  Reagan,  a  conserva- 
tive who  had  strongly  condemned  the  Nicaraguan  government, 
regarding  United  States  intervention  in  the  region.  At  this 
time,  Mexico  considered  Central  America,  particularly  Guate- 
mala, to  lie  within  its  geopolitical  sphere  of  influence.  Mexican 
policy,  since  the  victory  of  the  FSLN  in  1979,  had  sought  to  pro- 
vide an  alternative  to  United  States,  Cuban,  or  Soviet  influence 
on  the  isthmus.  This  Mexican  strategy,  however,  eventually 
failed  because  Cuban  influence  on  the  Nicaraguan  Sandinistas 
was  rooted  in  years  of  clandestine  support  for  the  revolutionary 
cause. 

The  United  States,  however,  rejected  Mexico's  conciliatory 
approach  to  Central  American  affairs  in  favor  of  military  sup- 
port to  friendly  governments,  such  as  those  in  El  Salvador  and 
Honduras,  and  the  even  more  controversial  policy  of  backing 
anti-Sandinista  guerrilla  forces.  After  the  economic  crisis  of 


62 


Historical  Setting 


1982,  Mexico  lost  much  of  its  influence  in  Central  America. 
Mexican  governments,  in  turn,  also  became  more  guarded  in 
their  criticism  of  United  States  policy  in  order  to  assure  Wash- 
ington's support  in  financial  forums  such  as  the  World  Bank 
(see  Glossary)  and  the  IMF. 

Although  the  two  nations  did  not  always  agree  on  the  best 
strategy  for  dealing  with  Mexico's  burgeoning  foreign  debt,  the 
United  States  government  continued  to  work  with  the  Mexi- 
cans and  support  efforts  to  buoy  the  Mexican  economy  and 
reschedule  the  debt.  Washington  announced  the  first  of  several 
debt  relief  agreements  in  August  1982.  Under  the  terms  of  the 
agreement,  the  United  States  purchased  ahead  of  schedule 
some  US$600  million  in  Mexican  crude  oil  for  its  strategic  oil 
reserve;  the  United  States  treasury  also  provided  US$1  billion 
in  guarantees  for  new  commercial  bank  loans  to  Mexico.  Pri- 
vately, United  States  officials  reportedly  pressured  commercial 
banks  to  postpone  a  US$10  billion  principal  payment  that  fell 
due  that  same  month. 

A  bank  advisory  group  representing  530  foreign  creditors 
reached  an  accord  with  Mexico  in  late  August  1984.  The 
rescheduling  agreement  allowed  Mexico  to  repay  its  foreign 
debt  over  a  term  of  fourteen  years  at  interest  rates  lower  than 
those  originally  contracted.  United  States  Federal  Reserve 
Board  Chairman  Paul  A.  Volcker,  among  others,  had  pushed 
for  the  interest  rate  reduction,  in  part  as  recognition  of 
Mexico's  having  instituted  difficult  austerity  measures  and 
needing  some  fiscal  relief  in  order  to  restore  economic  growth. 

Other  concerns  meanwhile  strained  the  Mexican-United 
States  relationship.  Perhaps  the  most  dramatic  was  drug  traf- 
ficking. The  consumption  of  cocaine  rose  steadily  in  the 
United  States  during  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  becoming 
a  major  law  enforcement  and  public  health  problem.  Mexico 
has  never  been  a  major  producer  of  cocaine.  Geography,  how- 
ever, made  Mexico  a  conduit  for  the  transshipment  of  cocaine 
hydrochloride  from  South  America  to  the  United  States.  Diffi- 
cult terrain;  sparse  population  in  many  rural  areas;  an  ade- 
quate infrastructure  for  transporting  goods  by  land,  sea,  and 
air;  and  the  relative  ease  of  bribing  both  local  and  federal  offi- 
cials all  lured  drug  traffickers  to  use  Mexico  as  a  conduit. 

Eventually,  an  isolated  incident  came  to  symbolize  Mexican 
drug  corruption  and  the  friction  between  the  two  nations  on 
the  issue  of  drug  trafficking.  The  United  States  Drug  Enforce- 
ment Administration  (DEA)  maintained  a  comparatively  large 


63 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

presence  in  Mexico.  One  of  its  resident  offices  operated  out  of 
the  consulate  in  Guadalajara.  In  March  1985,  Mexican  authori- 
ties unearthed  the  body  of  DEA  special  agent  Enrique  Cama- 
rena  on  a  ranch  in  Michoacan  state,  some  100  kilometers  from 
Guadalajara.  Mexican  drug  traffickers,  reports  later  revealed, 
had  tortured  Camarena  to  death,  perhaps  in  retaliation  for  his 
discovery  of  a  major  marijuana  cultivation  operation.  Initial 
protest  from  the  United  States  government  brought  little  or  no 
response  from  Mexican  officials.  As  a  result,  the  United  States 
Customs  Service  closed  nine  lesser  points  of  entry  from  Mexico 
to  the  United  States  and  began  searching  every  vehicle  that 
passed  northward.  The  resultant  traffic  backups,  complaints, 
and  economic  losses  infuriated  the  Mexican  government.  Mex- 
icans claimed  that  the  appearance  of  their  inaction  stemmed 
from  misperceptions  of  the  Mexican  legal  system,  not  from 
efforts  to  protect  drug  traffickers. 

Despite  the  eventual  arrest  of  a  key  suspect  in  the  Camarena 
murder,  relations  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico  on 
the  drug  issue  followed  a  rocky  course.  On  April  14  and  15, 
1985,  United  States  Attorney  General  Edwin  Meese  III  met  with 
his  Mexican  counterpart,  Sergio  Garcia  Ramirez.  The  two 
agreed  to  closer  monitoring  of  the  two  nations'  joint  counter- 
drug  programs.  The  Camarena  case,  however,  continued  to 
cast  a  pall  over  these  efforts.  Leaked  information  from  the 
United  States  Department  of  State  and  from  law  enforcement 
agencies  indicated  that  Mexican  authorities  had  made  only 
token  efforts  against  drug  production  and  trafficking.  Accord- 
ing to  Department  of  State  figures,  by  the  end  of  1985,  Mexico 
was  the  largest  exporter  of  marijuana  and  heroin  to  the  United 
States.  Efforts  at  eradicating  these  crops  had  failed  abysmally, 
and  output  in  1985  exceeded  1984  levels. 

As  controversy  continued  over  Mexican  drug  policy,  United 
States  politics  forced  another  bilateral  issue  to  the  fore.  The 
United  States  had  made  sporadic  efforts  over  the  years  to  exert 
greater  control  over  its  porous  southern  border.  Mexican  and 
Central  American  illegal  immigrants  crossed  the  border  almost 
at  will  to  seek  low-paid  jobs.  Organized  labor,  among  others, 
urged  the  United  States  Congress  to  act.  This  pressure,  based 
on  the  belief  that  illegal  aliens  took  large  numbers  of  jobs  that 
United  States  citizens  might  otherwise  fill,  gave  impetus  to  the 
Simpson-Rodino  bill  of  1986.  The  bill's  two  major  provisions 
constituted  a  carrot  and  a  stick  for  illegal  immigrants.  The  car- 
rot came  in  the  form  of  an  amnesty  for  all  undocumented  resi- 


64

dents  who  could  prove  continuous  residence  in  the  United 
States  since  January  1,  1982.  The  suck  imposed  legal  sanctions 
on  employers  of  illegal  aliens,  an  unprecedented  attempt  to 
deter  migrants  indirectly  by  denying  them  employment. 

The  Simpson-Rodino  bill,  which  became  law  as  the  United 
States  Immigration  Reform  and  Control  Act  of  1986,  repre- 
sented the  most  serious  effort  to  date  to  reduce  illegal  Mexican 
immigration.  Northern  migration  had  provided  an  economic 
safety  valve  from  the  Mexican  economy's  chronic  inability  to 
produce  sufficient  employment.  Many  Mexicans  resented  the 
timing  of  this  new  law,  which  came  in  the  midst  of  severe  eco- 
nomic distress  in  Mexico  and  relative  prosperity  in  the  United 
States.  Although  the  level  of  migration  dropped  immediately 
after  passage  of  the  law,  joblessness  and  poverty  eventually 
drove  the  number  of  illegal  migrants  up  again. 

Despite  the  irritants  of  drug  trafficking  and  migration,  the 
United  States  concern  for  stability  in  Mexico  led  both  coun- 
tries to  continue  the  search  for  a  solution  to  Mexico's  crushing 
debt  burden.  By  the  end  of  1987,  the  United  States  govern- 
ment publicly  recognized  that  Mexico  could  not  "grow  its  way 
out"  of  the  debt  merely  by  stretching  out  payments  and  invest- 
ing more  borrowed  funds.  Acknowledging  that  some  portion 
of  the  debt  would  never  be  repaid,  the  Department  of  the  Trea- 
sury offered  to  issue  zero-coupon  bonds  that  would  allow 
Mexico  to  buy  back  its  debt  at  a  discount  (see  1982  Crisis  and 
Recovery,  ch.  3).  Although  not  a  panacea,  the  plan  represented 
a  new  approach  to  the  debt  problem,  one  that  helped  to 
improve  Mexican  public  opinion  of  the  United  States. 

Economic  Hardship 

While  the  Mexican  government,  with  assistance  from  the 
United  States,  struggled  to  improve  its  status  in  the  world 
financial  community,  conditions  at  home  remained  unsettled. 
After  the  GNP  contracted  by  5  percent  in  1983,  Mexican  opti- 
mism surged  briefly  in  1984,  when  the  economy  posted  a  3.5 
percent  growth  rate.  The  next  year  hope  faded  as  the  economy 
contracted  by  1  percent. 

A  major  natural  disaster  in  1985  further  depressed  the  eco- 
nomic situation.  In  mid-September,  central  Mexico  experi- 
enced two  major  earthquakes.  Between  5,000  and  10,000 
people  died  as  a  result,  and  some  300,000  lost  their  homes.  The 
cost  of  relief  and  reconstruction  placed  a  heavy  burden  on  an 
already  struggling  nation.  The  de  la  Madrid  administration  suc- 


65 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


cessfully  cited  the  earthquakes  as  negotiating  points  in  its 
efforts  to  obtain  better  terms  from  its  creditors. 

In  the  political  arena,  initial  optimism  also  gave  way  to  disil- 
lusionment. The  liberalization  that  appeared  to  have  begun  in 
1983  ended  by  1984.  The  ruling  PRI  easily  swept  municipal 
elections  in  the  northern  cities  of  Mexicali  and  Tijuana,  in 
Coahuila  and  Sinaloa  states,  and  in  the  city  of  Puebla.  Despite 
public  protests  alleging  widespread  fraud,  the  results  stood. 
The  PRI  easily  maintained  its  majority  in  congress,  but  some 
party  leaders  were  concerned  that  of  the  combined  vote  in  five 
large  cities — Mexico  City,  Guadalajara,  Nezahualcoyotl, 
Monterrey,  and  Ciudad  Juarez — the  PRI  polled  less  than  45 
percent.  The  vote  in  the  northern  cities  could  be  seen  to 
reflect  the  traditional  regional  schism,  but  the  poor  showing  in 
the  capital  area  and  Guadalajara  signaled  a  growing  alienation 
from  the  PRI,  particularly  among  the  middle  class. 

Moreover,  the  persistent  fall  in  oil  prices  and  continuing 
high  levels  of  foreign  debt  service  forced  a  new  round  of  aus- 
terity measures.  De  la  Madrid  effected  an  additional  US$465 
million  in  federal  budget  cuts  by  reducing  subsidies  and  gov- 
ernment investments,  selling  more  than  200  state-owned  para- 
statals,  and  placing  a  partial  freeze  on  federal  hiring.  As  the 
president  announced  these  new  belt-tightening  measures,  he 
could  also  point  to  some  significant  achievements.  Inflation, 
which  had  exceeded  100  percent  in  1982,  had  declined  to  60 
percent  annually.  The  public-sector  deficit  had  also  decreased 
from  13.6  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glos- 
sary) to  6.9  percent.  Although  these  figures  fell  short  of  the 
goals  prescribed  by  the  IMF,  they  represented  progress. 

De  la  Madrid  did  not  exaggerate  the  importance  of  these 
positive  economic  indicators.  In  his  1986  State  of  the  Nation 
address,  he  declared  that  "our  austerity  effort  is  permanent" 
and  vowed  again  not  to  deviate  from  his  economic  course.  Just 
months  before,  his  administration  had  reached  a  precedent- 
setting  agreement  with  the  IMF  in  which  the  amount  of  new 
loans  to  Mexico  would  be  tied  to  fluctuations  in  the  world  price 
of  crude  oil.  But  the  crisis  was  far  from  over.

The  year  1987  in  Mexico  was  the  last  full  year  of  de  la 


66 


Historical  Setting 


Madrid's  presidential  term.  In  both  economic  and  political 
terms,  de  la  Madrid's  last  months  in  office  proved  tumultuous. 
Economically,  the  administration's  failure  to  restore  sustain- 
able growth  rates  produced  a  new  flare-up.  On  November  18, 
1987,  the  government  recognized  the  overvalue  of  the  peso 
and  announced  that  the  national  currency  would  be  allowed  to 
float  on  the  free  exchange  market.  The  free  float  produced  an 
overnight  devaluation  of  18  percent;  devaluation  in  turn  reig- 
nited  inflation,  which  jumped  to  144  percent  on  an  annual 
basis.  To  avoid  an  economic  disaster,  de  la  Madrid  mandated 
the  Economic  Solidarity  Pact  among  government,  business, 
and  labor  to  control  both  prices  and  wages.  Although  the  gov- 
ernment had  always  exercised  immense  influence  over  the 
economy,  wage  and  price  controls  of  this  scope  were  unheard 
of.  Their  implementation  by  a  president  who  had  made  sincere 
but  ineffective  efforts  to  liberalize  the  economy  demonstrated 
both  de  la  Madrid's  frustration  and  his  determination  to  avoid 
personal  blame  for  the  intractable  crisis. 

The  man  who  inherited  this  unenviable  legacy  was  a  forty- 
year-old  economist  with  wide  experience  in  the  Mexican 
bureaucracy.  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari  was  de  la  Madrid's  minis- 
ter of  budget  and  planning  when  the  president  decided  that 
Salinas  was  best  qualified  to  assume  the  helm  of  state.  The 
selection  of  Salinas  appeared  calculated  to  signal  the  continua- 
tion of  de  la  Madrid's  austere  economic  policies,  which  were 
largely  shaped  by  Salinas.  A  Harvard-educated  Ph.D.,  Salinas 
was  a  tecnico,  a  competent  technocrat  with  little  or  no  grassroots 
political  experience.  Technically,  he  was  highly  qualified  to 
deal  with  the  nation's  problems.  Politically,  however,  he  had  to 
define  himself  on  the  campaign  trail. 

Although  throughout  his  administration  de  la  Madrid  had 
publicly  vowed  to  promote  political  reform,  this  promise  was 
not  realized.  De  la  Madrid's  failure  to  open  up  the  political  sys- 
tem to  genuine  competition  dashed  the  expectations  of  Mexi- 
cans both  within  and  outside  the  ruling  party.  As  a  result  some 
disaffected  PRI  members  chose  to  establish  the  Democratic 
Current  (Corriente  Democratico — CD)  within  the  party  in 
October  1986. 

The  CD  leaders  were  Porfirio  Munoz  Ledo,  a  former  chair- 
man of  the  PRI,  and  Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas,  former  governor 
of  Michoacan  state  and  son  of  president  Cardenas.  The  pri- 
mary issue  binding  the  faction  members  together  was  the 
exclusionary  nature  of  party-nominating  procedures.  They  par- 


67 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

ticularly  condemned  the  practice  of  the  dedazo,  whereby  the  sit- 
ting president  chooses  his  successor,  who  is  then  declared  the 
party's  candidate  by  acclamation.  In  addition,  CD  members 
and  their  sympathizers  also  objected  to  de  la  Madrid's  austere 
economic  policies  on  nationalistic  grounds.  The  president, 
they  believed,  had  mortgaged  the  national  patrimony  to  for- 
eigners. Such  policies,  these  dissidents  claimed,  resulted  from 
the  noncompetitive  nomination  of  tecnico  presidents  who  had 
no  feeling  for  the  plight  of  the  average  Mexican. 

The  CD  did  not  find  a  receptive  audience  for  its  message 
within  the  PRI.  At  the  party's  national  assembly  in  March  1987, 
party  president  Jorge  de  la  Vega  condemned  the  CD,  recom- 
mending that  those  who  could  not  abide  by  the  party's  rules 
should  resign.  Months  later,  the  PRI  leadership  formally  "con- 
demned, rejected,  and  denounced"  Muhoz  and  Cardenas,  ren- 
dering them  persona  non  grata  within  their  own  party. 

Ostracized  by  his  former  party  members,  Cardenas  declared 
himself  an  independent  candidate  for  president  on  July  3, 
1987.  Backed  by  a  coalition  of  leftist  parties  that  eventually 
dubbed  itself  the  National  Democratic  Front  (Frente 
Democratico  Nacional — FDN),  Cardenas  advocated  a  "return 
to  the  original  principles  of  the  Mexican  Revolution."  The  can- 
didate's familial  heritage  infused  this  message  with  legitimacy 
and  had  considerable  emotional  appeal  for  the  Mexican  voter. 
Nationalistic  policy  prescriptions,  such  as  repudiation  of  the 
foreign  debt  and  the  redistribution  of  oil  exports  away  from 
the  United  States,  appealed  to  the  poor,  whose  lives  had  clearly 
not  improved  under  de  la  Madrid's  administration.  Like  most 
Mexicans,  Cardenas  was  mestizo.  The  prospect  of  rule  by  some- 
one other  than  an  elite,  light-skinned  tecnico  further  added  to 
Cardenas's  appeal. 

Many  in  the  PRI  recognized  the  threat  posed  by  Cardenas's 
candidacy.  In  response,  the  party  leadership  attempted  to  make 
it  appear  that  the  presidential  nominating  process  had  been 
made  more  pluralistic.  On  August  14,  1987,  de  la  Vega 
announced  a  list  of  six  candidates  for  the  nomination,  includ- 
ing Salinas,  but  not  Cardenas.  The  convention  formally  nomi- 
nated Salinas  on  October  4,  1987.  Salinas  began  his  campaign 
having  to  defend  unpopular  policies  against  a  popular  rival  at  a 
time  when  his  party's  solidarity  and  influence  were  in  question. 
Despite  Salinas's  pronouncements  mandating  electoral  probity, 
the  July  1988  elections  appeared  to  most  observers  to  be  fraud- 
ulent. The  most  serious  incidents  were  the  deaths  of  two  key 


68

aides  to  Cardenas,  Xavier  Ovando  and  Roman  Gil,  which  were 
never  adequately  explained. 

Post-election  reports  by  outside  observers  and  voter  inter- 
views indicated  that  much  of  the  rural  vote  experienced  some 
degree  of  tampering;  the  FDN  and  the  PAN  had  insufficient 
observers  to  monitor  such  elections.  After  much  delay,  the  elec- 
tion commission  declared  Salinas  the  winner  on  July  13,  1988. 
The  surprise  was  the  total  number  of  votes  for  the  victor — 
50.36  percent.  The  low  total,  which  itself  spoke  of  manipula- 
tion, demonstrated  the  people's  disaffection  with  the  PRI. 

President  Salinas 

The  1988  election  did  not  end  Salinas's  struggle  to  succeed 
his  mentor,  de  la  Madrid.  Cardenas  rejected  the  Electoral  Com- 
mission's results,  which  showed  him  with  31.1  percent  of  the 
national  vote.  On  July  17,  1988,  Cardenas  addressed  a  rally  of 
some  200,000  in  Mexico  City,  in  an  effort  to  force  a  recount. 
Eventually,  along  with  the  PAN  candidate  Manuel  Clouthier, 
the  two  opposition  candidates  united  to  demand  that  the  elec- 
tions be  nullified  and  an  interim  president  appointed. 

On  August  15,  1988,  the  National  Congress,  sitting  as  the 
electoral  college,  met  to  ratify  the  presidential  vote.  Cardenas 
filed  criminal  charges  against  Minister  of  Interior  Manuel  Bar- 
tlett  Diaz,  who  also  served  as  head  of  the  Federal  Electoral 
Commission.  Despite  an  August  15  rally  by  the  FDN  and  the 
PAN,  nationwide  protests  never  materialized;  the  electoral  col- 
lege ratified  Salinas's  victory  as  expected. 

Meanwhile,  during  his  final  months  in  office,  de  la  Madrid 
sought  to  maintain  the  economy  on  an  even  keel  for  his  succes- 
sor. On  August  15,  1988,  the  government  extended  the  wage 
and  price  freeze  through  November  30,  the  end  of  de  la 
Madrid's  term.  The  freeze  had  done  what  had  been  expected — 
it  had  reduced  inflation  from  15.5  percent  in  January  to  1  per- 
cent in  August.  To  ease  the  burden  somewhat  on  the  poor,  the 
administration  also  eliminated  a  6  percent  value-added  tax  on 
basic  foodstuffs  and  medicine  and  decreed  a  30  percent  tax  cut 
for  low-income  workers.  The  exchange  rate  of  the  peso  to  the 
dollar  remained  fixed  at  the  2,270-to-l  level  established  in 
December  1987. 

On  October  17,  1988,  the  United  States  government 
announced  a  US$3.5  billion  loan  to  Mexico  to  help  ease  the 
revenue  shortfall  resulting  from  the  continued  drop  in  oil 
prices.  The  loan  was  considered  a  bridge  loan  to  tide  Mexico

over  until  it  could  reach  agreement  with  the  IMF  and  the 
World  Bank.  Many  observers  considered  the  United  States 
action  to  have  been  prompted  more  by  political  concerns  than 
economic  ones.  From  1982  to  1988,  real  income  in  Mexico  had 
fallen  by  40  percent;  inflation  had  reached  almost  160  percent 
annually,  privatization  efforts  had  eliminated  thousands  of  jobs 
that  had  not  yet  been  replaced  by  the  private  sector,  and  the 
economy  had  contracted  more  than  it  had  grown.  In  late  April 
1988,  candidate  Salinas  visited  the  United  States  to  sound  out 
both  United  States  presidential  candidates  George  H.W.  Bush 
and  Michael  Dukakis  and  to  visit  with  members  of  the  United 
States  Congress,  interest  groups,  the  press,  academics,  and 
influential  Mexican-Americans.  Even  before  his  election,  it  was 
clear  that  Salinas  set  great  store  on  productive  relations  with 
Mexico's  northern  neighbor.  The  October  loan  may  have  been 
one  result  of  his  efforts. 

Salinas  took  office  on  December  1,  1988.  In  preinaugural 
interviews,  he  promised  the  "political,  economic,  and  cultural 
modernization"  of  Mexico  and  an  improvement  in  Mexico's 
standing  abroad.  During  the  inaugural  ceremony,  Cardenas's 
supporters  walked  out  in  protest;  PAN  members  protested 
silently  throughout.  In  his  speech,  Salinas  stressed  the  impor- 
tance of  a  sound  economy  to  the  nation's  future.  The  debt,  he 
claimed,  was  the  primary  problem  in  this  regard.  He  urged  fur- 
ther renegotiation,  "no  longer  to  pay,  but  to  return  to  growth." 
Salinas,  however,  had  no  intention  of  reneging  on  any  portion 
of  the  debt.  The  new  president  also  promised  further  political 
reform. 

Salinas  made  the  economy  his  first  priority.  On  December 
12,  1988,  he  ended  the  wage,  price,  and  exchange-rate  freeze 
instituted  under  de  la  Madrid.  In  its  place,  the  new  president 
advocated  price  restraint,  a  modest  wage  increase,  and  a  sched- 
uled devaluation  averaging  one  peso  per  day  against  the  dollar. 
Salinas  endorsed  de  la  Madrid's  efforts  for  Mexico's  entry  into 
the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT), 
although  imports  had  risen  and  foreign  reserves  had  dwindled 
since  membership  had  first  been  proposed.  Salinas  privately 
held  that  Mexico  must  open  and  integrate  itself  more  exten- 
sively into  the  world  economy  in  order  to  progress  and  meet 
the  employment  needs  of  a  burgeoning  young  population. 
Over  the  short  term,  however,  he  admitted  that  1989  would  be 
a  "year  of  transition,"  with  little  overall  economic  growth. 


70 


Historical  Setting 


Initially,  Salinas  hoped  to  diversify  Mexico's  markets  by 
expanding  trade  with  the  industrialized  nations  of  Europe  and 
perhaps  with  Japan.  A  state  tour  of  Europe  and  other  contacts, 
however,  convinced  him  that  this  hope  was  illusory.  Geography, 
history,  infrastructure,  investment,  financial  ties,  and  other  fac- 
tors made  the  United  States  the  arbiter  of  Mexican  economic 
progress,  whether  President  Salinas  liked  it  or  not.  Accordingly, 
Salinas  began  to  develop  a  notion  that  he  had  first  proposed  to 
United  States  president-elect  Bush  in  late  November  1988.  The 
Mexican  president-elect  suggested  the  establishment  of  free 
trade  between  the  two  nations,  as  a  natural  extension  of  bilat- 
eral agreements  already  negotiated  in  such  areas  as  steel,  tex- 
tiles, and  automobiles.  Bush  had  promised  to  take  the 
suggestion  under  advisement. 

In  several  ways,  Salinas  followed  the  pattern  established  by 
his  predecessor.  He  wasted  little  time  in  moving  against  poten- 
tial political  enemies  in  his  own  moral  renewal  campaign. 
Where  de  la  Madrid  had  moved  quietly,  however,  Salinas  acted 
more  dramatically.  The  corrupt  leader  of  the  oil  workers 
union,  Joaquin  Hernandez  Galicia  (also  known  as  La  Quina), 
surrendered  after  a  gunfight  with  federal  police  at  union  head- 
quarters (see  Petroleum,  ch.  3).  Subsequently,  authorities  took 
into  custody  broker  Eduardo  Leorreta,  a  PRI  member  and 
former  fundraiser  for  the  party,  on  charges  of  tax  fraud. 

With  his  political  flanks  covered,  and  having  included  both 
tecnicos  and  oldtime  PRI  members  (disparagingly  nicknamed 
"dinosaurs")  among  his  cabinet,  Salinas  felt  secure  enough  to 
begin  his  program  of  economic  liberalization  and  reform.  In 
May  1989,  he  ended  previous  restrictions  on  foreign  ownership 
of  business  in  Mexico  and  opened  to  foreign  investment  some 
previously  restricted  areas.  The  president  also  promised  to  sim- 
plify the  bureaucratic  process  that  often  had  deterred  investors 
in  the  past.  The  new  administration  also  continued  the  process 
of  privatization  begun  under  de  la  Madrid.  The  major  casualty 
of  this  process  was  Altos  Hornos  de  Mexico,  a  state-owned  steel 
mill  in  Monclova,  where  1,740  workers  lost  their  jobs  under  a 
foreign-financed  modernization  program  begun  in  June  1989. 
The  previous  administration  had  closed  outright  the  Fundi- 
dora  Monterrey,  another  steel  mill,  in  1986,  putting  almost 
13,000  out  of  work. 

In  laying  the  groundwork  for  economic  liberalization,  the 
government  announced  in  July  1989  that  it  had  reached 
another  accord  with  its  foreign  creditors  after  four  months  of 


71 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

negotiations.  Under  the  so-called  Brady  Plan,  an  approach 
advocated  by  United  States  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Nicholas 
F.  Brady  to  reduce  Mexico's  debt  principal,  the  IMF  agreed  to 
provide  US$3.5  billion  over  three  years,  US$1  billion  of  which 
was  designed  to  assure  Mexico's  bank  payments.  In  addition, 
the  World  Bank  was  to  provide  US$6  billion  over  three  years 
for  economic  development  and  guarantees.  The  government 
of  Japan  also  provided  US$2.05  billion  in  debt  reduction  loans. 
Foreign  creditor  banks  received  three  options:  to  make  new 
loans  to  Mexico,  to  reduce  the  principal  by  writing  off  some 
percentage  of  their  loans,  or  to  cut  the  interest  rates  they 
charged  on  Mexican  loans.  The  net  effect  of  the  terms  was  to 
reduce  Mexico's  foreign  debt  payments  by  US$8  billion  per 
year. 

The  debt  agreement  behind  him,  Salinas  began  to  make 
good  on  his  promise  of  political  reform.  In  the  balloting  of  July 
1989,  the  PRI  conceded  the  governorship  of  Baja  California 
Norte  to  the  candidate  of  the  PAN.  This  was  a  historic  event, 
the  first  time  that  the  PRI  had  admitted  the  loss  of  a  state  elec- 
tion. At  the  same  time,  however,  the  PRI  took  a  firm  stand  in 
Cardenas's  home  state  of  Michoacan,  where  the  ruling  party 
claimed  to  have  won  eleven  of  eighteen  seats  in  the  state  legis- 
lature. Cardenas's  party,  now  known  as  the  Democratic  Revolu- 
tionary Party  (Partido  Revolucionario  Democratico — PRE)), 
protested  that  its  candidates  had  taken  fifteen  of  the  eighteen 
seats.  The  PRI,  they  claimed,  had  stuffed  ballot  boxes. 

Allegations  of  voting  fraud  aside,  the  United  States  govern- 
ment, led  by  President  Bush,  was  very  supportive  of  Salinas  and 
his  efforts,  particularly  in  the  economic  arena.  Salinas's  origi- 
nal suggestion  of  a  free-trade  agreement  received  serious  con- 
sideration in  Washington.  Eventually,  after  the  debt  reduction 
agreement  and  liberalization  efforts  in  such  areas  as  foreign 
investment  and  privatization,  United  States  officials  felt  that  a 
free-trade  accord  was  a  logical  next  step  in  opening  the  Mexi- 
can economy  and  incorporating  it  into  a  North  American  trad- 
ing bloc.  Accordingly,  on  June  11,  1990,  the  two  governments 
agreed  in  principle  to  negotiate  a  "comprehensive  free-trade 
agreement"  that  would  eliminate  not  only  tariff  barriers,  but 
also  "import  quotas,  licenses,  and  technical  barriers"  to  the  free 
flow  of  goods,  services,  and  capital  between  the  two  nations.  As 
negotiations  progressed,  the  treaty  would  become  known  as 
the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA)  (see 
Trade  Agreements,  ch.  3) .  The  agreement  fit  logically  into  Sali- 


72 


Historical  Setting 


nas's  vision  of  a  modernizing  Mexico,  at  least  in  an  economic 
sense.  In  1992  NAFTA  was  approved  by  the  legislatures  of 
Mexico,  the  United  States,  and  Canada  to  take  effect  on  Janu- 
ary 1,  1994. 

With  the  president's  support,  congress  passed  modest  politi- 
cal reforms  during  the  last  half  of  Salinas's  term.  In  1992  con- 
stitutional restrictions  on  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  were 
repealed  (see  Church-State  Relations,  ch.  2).  The  following 
year,  congress  passed  a  package  of  electoral  reforms,  including 
limits  on  campaign  financing,  expansion  of  the  Senate  to  allow 
a  third  minority-party  senator  from  each  state,  and  increased 
proportional  representation  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  (see 
The  Salinas  Presidency:  Reform  and  Retrenchment,  ch.  4). 

As  in  previous  sexenios,  the  last  year  of  the  Salinas  administra- 
tion was  a  time  of  crisis.  On  January  1,  1994,  the  Zapatista  Army 
of  National  Liberation  (Ejercito  Zapatista  de  Liberation  Nacio- 
nal — EZLN),  a  heretofore  unknown  group,  suddenly  overran 
several  towns  in  Chiapas  (see  National  Security  Concerns,  ch. 
5).  The  overwhelming  military  response  forced  the  rebels  into 
the  mountains,  but  the  rebels'  demands  for  reform  reminded 
the  country  that  recent  economic  improvements  had  failed  to 
reach  many  in  the  lower  classes  or  in  the  impoverished  south. 

Political  uncertainty  increased  during  1994.  In  March  Luis 
Donaldo  Colosio  Murrieta,  the  PRI  presidential  candidate,  was 
assassinated  while  campaigning  in  Tijuana.  Several  investiga- 
tions failed  to  produce  a  motive  or  the  existence  of  a  conspir- 
acy. Rumors  circulated,  however,  that  the  assassination  was 
drug-related  or  the  action  of  old-line  PRI  members  opposed  to 
political  reform.  Anxious  to  divorce  itself  from  a  reputation  of 
fraud,  the  PRI  quickly  nominated  reform-minded  Ernesto 
Zedillo  Ponce  de  Leon  as  its  presidential  candidate.  Zedillo 
had  been  Salinas's  secretary  of  budget  and  secretary  of  educa- 
tion and  was  widely  perceived  as  someone  who  would  continue 
Salinas's  policies. 

With  all  eyes  focused  on  the  presidential  campaign  and  the 
uprising  in  Chiapas,  few  noticed  the  worsening  economy  in 
1994.  A  rising  deficit  in  the  current  account  made  the  economy 
increasingly  vulnerable  to  shifts  in  external  capital  flow. 
Although  statistics  showed  a  healthy  rise  in  exports,  most  of  the 
exports  were  goods  from  the  border-zone  maquiladora  (see 
Glossary)  industries,  with  little  overall  benefit  to  the  Mexican 
economy  or  Mexican  workers.  In  addition,  rising  interest  rates 
in  the  United  States  diverted  much-needed  capital  from  the

developing  world.  The  government  was  reluctant  to  take  strin- 
gent economic  measures  in  an  election  year,  however,  and 
instead  issued  short-term,  dollar-denominated  bonds  to 
finance  government  spending. 

The  election  results  of  August  21,  1994,  contained  no  sur- 
prises. The  PRI  candidate,  Zedillo,  won  the  presidency  with  49 
percent  of  the  vote.  The  PAN  took  26  percent  of  the  total,  the 
major  candidate  on  the  left  garnered  16  percent,  and  six  minor 
parties  accounted  for  the  rest.  Despite  some  irregularities, 
international  observers  declared  that  the  election  was  generally 
honest,  and  Zedillo  was  inaugurated  on  December  1,  1994. 

With  the  election  over,  attention  turned  to  the  economy. 
Most  economists  felt  that  the  currency  was  overvalued,  and  a 
devaluation  was  widely  anticipated.  When  a  devaluation  was 
announced  on  December  20,  however,  the  result  was  unex- 
pected. Investors  panicked,  and  large  amounts  of  capital  were 
pulled  out  of  Mexico  or  converted  to  dollars.  Government 
measures  to  stem  the  exodus  of  funds  only  exacerbated  the 
problem.  Government  debt  rose  sharply,  and  inflation  and 
interest  rates  soared.  Only  large-scale  international  interven- 
tion stopped  the  downward  spiral. 

President  Salinas  had  hoped  that  his  free-market  economic 
policies  and  political  reforms  would  bring  sustained  economic 
growth  and  increased  democratization.  The  realities  of  the  last 
years  of  the  twentieth  century  differed,  however.  The  Mexican 
economy  suffered  one  of  its  worst  downturns  since  the  Great 
Depression  of  the  1930s.  The  PRI's  lessening  grip  on  power  led 
not  to  stability  but  to  an  era  of  increased  political  and  social 
turmoil.  As  so  often  in  Mexico's  past,  in  the  late  1990s  democ- 
racy and  prosperity  remained  only  tantalizing  goals.

An  enormous  wealth  of  historical  literature  exists  on 
Mexico.  Both  Mexican  and  foreign  historians  have  produced 
analyses  of  the  developments  leading  to  the  country's  position 
in  contemporary  Latin  America.  The  most  useful  standard  his- 
tories of  Mexico  are  Henry  Bamford  Parkes's  A  History  of 
Mexico,  Charles  C.  Cumberland's  Mexico:  The  Struggle  for  Moder- 
nity, Frank  Tannenbaum's  Mexico:  The  Struggle  for  Peace  and 
Bread,  and  Jan  S.  Bazant's  A  Concise  History  of  Mexico.  Although 
now  slightly  dated,  the  most  complete  and  best  researched  gen- 
eral historical  analysis  available  in  English  is  Michael  C.  Meyer

and  William  L.  Sherman's  The  Course  of  Mexican  History,  a  com- 
prehensive book  that  presents  Mexican  history  from  precon- 
quest  times  to  the  inauguration  of  President  de  la  Madrid  in 
1982. 

For  the  study  of  pre-Columbian  peoples  and  their  origins, 
Eric  R.  Wolfs  Sons  of  the  Shaking  Earth  and  Michael  D.  Coe's 
Mexico  are  extremely  useful.  The  Aztec  traditions  and  belief  sys- 
tem are  also  well  researched  and  artfully  presented  in  Jose 
Lopez  Portillo's  Quetzalcdatl.  The  classic  work  of  Bernal  Diaz 
del  Castillo,  The  Discovery  and  Conquest  of  Mexico,  1517-1521, 
remains  one  of  the  best  sources  of  information  about  the 
arrival  of  the  Spaniards  in  Mexico  and  the  victory  over  the 
Aztec. 

For  the  colonial  period,  useful  studies  are  Clarence  Henry 
Haring's  The  Spanish  Empire  in  America,  Charles  Gibson's  Spain 
in  America,  Francois  Chevalier's  Land  and  Society  in  Colonial 
Mexico,  William  B.  Taylor's  Landlord  and  Peasant  in  Colonial 
Oaxaca,  and  James  Lockhart  and  Stuart  B.  Schwartz's  Early 
Latin  America.  The  struggle  for  independence  and  the  Mexican 
Revolution  are  the  best  researched  subjects.  Aside  from  the 
general  works  already  cited,  useful  sources  include  W.  Dirk 
Raat's  Mexico:  From  Independence  to  Revolution,  1810-1910,  Victor 
Alba's  The  Mexicans:  The  Making  of  a  Nation,  Jesus  Romero 
Flores's  La  revolucion  mexicana  (anales  historicos,  1910-1974) , 
John  Womackjr.'s  classic  Zapata  and  the  Mexican  Revolution,  and 
many  more.

PROFOUND  CHANGES  OCCURRED  IN  Mexican  society  dur- 
ing the  second  half  of  the  twentieth  century.  A  sharp  decline  in 
mortality  levels,  coupled  with  fertility  rates  that  remained  rela- 
tively high  until  the  mid-1970s,  produced  a  massive  population 
increase.  Indeed,  the  1990  census  total  of  approximately  81 
million  Mexicans  was  more  than  triple  the  figure  recorded 
forty  years  earlier.  Mexico's  stagnant  agricultural  sector  could 
not  absorb  the  millions  of  additional  workers,  triggering  a 
steady  migration  to  the  cities.  As  a  result,  Mexico  shifted  from  a 
predominantly  rural  to  a  heavily  urban  society.  Because  of  the 
lack  of  available  housing,  migrants  generally  clustered  on  the 
periphery  of  Mexico  City  and  other  major  urban  centers.  The 
local  infrastructure  often  could  not  keep  pace  with  such 
growth,  resulting  in  serious  environmental  concerns. 

Despite  the  massive  problems  caused  by  the  rapid  popula- 
tion shift,  successive  Mexican  governments  could  point  to  nota- 
ble accomplishments  in  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  their 
citizens.  In  the  years  after  World  War  II,  the  percentage  of 
deaths  caused  by  infectious,  parasitic,  and  respiratory  illnesses 
fell  dramatically.  Both  the  number  and  percentage  of  Mexicans 
with  access  to  basic  services  such  as  running  water  and  electric- 
ity grew  substantially.  Literacy  and  educational  levels  continued 
to  climb. 

The  benefits  of  modernization  were  not  equally  distributed, 
however.  Residents  of  southern  Mexico  consistently  trailed  the 
rest  of  the  country  in  "quality-of-life"  indicators.  Urban  workers 
in  the  informal  sector  of  the  economy  did  not  have  access  to 
the  same  level  of  health  care  as  their  counterparts  in  the  for- 
mal sector  and  did  not  qualify  for  retirement  or  pension  pay- 
ments. Income  distribution  had  become  increasingly  skewed  in 
favor  of  the  wealthiest  sectors  of  society.  Mexican  policy  makers 
thus  faced  the  difficult  challenge  of  ensuring  economic  growth 
while  also  confronting  the  persistence  of  poverty. 

Physical  Setting 

Mexico's  total  area  covers  1,972,550  square  kilometers, 
including  approximately  6,000  square  kilometers  of  islands  in 
the  Pacific  Ocean,  Gulf  of  Mexico,  Caribbean  Sea,  and  Gulf  of 
California  (see  fig.  3) .  On  its  north,  Mexico  shares  a  3,326-kilo- 


79 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

meter  border  with  the  United  States.  The  meandering  Rio 
Bravo  del  Norte  (known  as  the  Rio  Grande  in  the  United 
States)  defines  the  border  from  Ciudad  Juarez  east  to  the  Gulf 
of  Mexico.  A  series  of  natural  and  artificial  markers  delineate 
the  United  States-Mexican  border  west  from  Ciudad  Juarez  to 
the  Pacific  Ocean.  On  its  south,  Mexico  shares  an 
871-kilometer  border  with  Guatemala  and  a  251-kilometer  bor- 
der with  Belize.  Mexico  has  a  10,143-kilometer  coastline,  of 
which  7,338  kilometers  face  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  the  Gulf  of 
California,  and  the  remaining  2,805  kilometers  front  the  Gulf 
of  Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  Sea.  Mexico's  exclusive  economic 
zone  (EEZ),  which  extends  200  nautical  miles  off  each  coast, 
covers  approximately  2.7  million  square  kilometers.  The  land- 
mass  of  Mexico  dramatically  narrows  as  it  moves  in  a  southeast- 
erly direction  from  the  United  States  border  and  then  abruptly 
curves  northward  before  ending  in  the  500-kilometer-long 
Yucatan  Peninsula.  Indeed,  the  capital  of  Yucatan  State, 
Merida,  is  farther  north  than  Mexico  City  or  Guadalajara. 

Topography  and  Drainage 

Two  prominent  mountain  ranges — the  Sierra  Madre  Occi- 
dental and  the  Sierra  Madre  Oriental — define  northern 
Mexico.  Both  are  extensions  of  ranges  found  in  the  United 
States.  The  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  on  the  west  is  a  continua- 
tion of  California's  Sierra  Nevada  (with  a  break  in  southeastern 
California  and  extreme  northern  Mexico),  and  the  Sierra 
Madre  Oriental  on  the  east  is  a  southward  extension  of  the 
Rocky  Mountains  of  New  Mexico  and  Texas.  Between  these  two 
ranges  lies  the  Mexican  altiplano  (high  plain),  a  southern  con- 
tinuation of  the  Great  Basin  and  high  deserts  that  spread  over 
much  of  the  western  United  States. 

Beginning  approximately  fifty  kilometers  from  the  United 
States  border,  the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  extends  1,250  kilo- 
meters south  to  the  Rio  Santiago,  where  it  merges  with  the  Cor- 
dillera Neovolcanica  range  that  runs  east-west  across  central 
Mexico.  The  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  lies  approximately  300 
kilometers  inland  from  the  west  coast  of  Mexico  at  its  northern 
end  but  approaches  to  within  fifty  kilometers  of  the  coast  near 
the  Cordillera  Neovolcanica.  The  northwest  coastal  plain  is  the 
name  given  the  lowland  area  between  the  Sierra  Madre  Occi- 
dental and  the  Gulf  of  California.  The  Sierra  Madre  Occiden- 
tal averages  2,250  meters  in  elevation,  with  peaks  reaching 
3,000  meters.

The  Sierra  Madre  Oriental  starts  at  the  Big  Bend  region  of 
the  Texas-Mexico  border  and  continues  1,350  kilometers  until 
reaching  Cofre  de  Perote,  one  of  the  major  peaks  of  the  Cordi- 
llera Neovolcanica.  As  is  the  case  with  the  Sierra  Madre  Occi- 
dental, the  Sierra  Madre  Oriental  comes  progressively  closer  to 
the  coastline  as  it  approaches  its  southern  terminus,  reaching 
to  within  seventy-five  kilometers  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  The 
northeast  coastal  plain  extends  from  the  eastern  slope  of  the 
Sierra  Madre  Oriental  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  The  median  ele- 
vation of  the  Sierra  Madre  Oriental  is  2,200  meters,  with  some 
peaks  at  3,000  meters. 

The  Mexican  altiplano,  stretching  from  the  United  States 
border  to  the  Cordillera  Neovolcanica,  occupies  the  vast 
expanse  of  land  between  the  eastern  and  western  sierra 
madres.  A  low  east-west  range  divides  the  altiplano  into  north- 
ern and  southern  sections.  These  two  sections,  previously 
called  the  Mesa  del  Norte  and  Mesa  Central,  are  now  regarded 
by  geographers  as  sections  of  one  altiplano.  The  northern  alti- 
plano averages  1,100  meters  in  elevation  and  continues  south 
from  the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte  through  the  states  of  Zacatecas 
and  San  Luis  Potosi.  Various  narrow,  isolated  ridges  cross  the 
plateaus  of  the  northern  altiplano.  Numerous  depressions  dot 
the  region,  the  largest  of  which  is  the  Bolson  de  Mapimi.  The 
southern  altiplano  is  higher  than  its  northern  counterpart, 
averaging  2,000  meters  in  elevation.  The  southern  altiplano 
contains  numerous  valleys  originally  formed  by  ancient  lakes. 
Several  of  Mexico's  most  prominent  cities,  including  Mexico 
City  and  Guadalajara,  are  located  in  the  valleys  of  the  southern 
altiplano. 

One  other  significant  mountain  range,  the  California  sys- 
tem, cuts  across  the  landscape  of  the  northern  half  of  Mexico. 
A  southern  extension  of  the  California  coastal  ranges  that  par- 
allel California's  coast,  the  Mexican  portion  of  the  California 
system  extends  from  the  United  States  border  to  the  southern 
tip  of  the  Baja  Peninsula,  a  distance  of  1,430  kilometers.  Peaks 
in  the  California  system  range  in  altitude  from  2,200  meters  in 
the  north  to  only  250  meters  near  La  Paz  in  the  south.  Narrow 
lowlands  are  found  on  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  the  Gulf  of  Cali- 
fornia sides  of  the  mountains. 

The  Cordillera  Neovolcanica  is  a  belt  900  kilometers  long 
and  130  kilometers  wide,  extending  from  the  Pacific  Ocean  to 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  The  Cordillera  Neovolcanica  begins  at  the 
Rio  Grande  de  Santiago  and  continues  south  to  Colima,  where

it  turns  east  along  the  nineteenth  parallel  to  the  central  por- 
tion of  the  state  of  Veracruz.  The  region  is  distinguished  by 
considerable  seismic  activity  and  contains  Mexico's  highest  vol- 
canic peaks.  This  range  contains  three  peaks  exceeding  5,000 
meters:  Pico  de  Orizaba  (Citlaltepetl) — the  third  highest 
mountain  in  North  America — and  Popocatepetl  and  Iztac- 
cihuatl  near  Mexico  City.  The  Cordillera  Neovolcanica  is 
regarded  as  the  geological  dividing  line  between  North  Amer- 
ica and  Central  America. 

Several  important  mountain  ranges  dominate  the  landscape 
of  southern  and  southeastern  Mexico.  The  Sierra  Madre  del 
Sur  extends  1,200  kilometers  along  Mexico's  southern  coast 
from  the  southwestern  part  of  the  Cordillera  Neovolcanica  to 
the  nearly  flat  isthmus  of  Tehuantepec.  Mountains  in  this 
range  average  2,000  meters  in  elevation.  The  range  averages 
100  kilometers  in  width,  but  widens  to  150  kilometers  in  the 
state  of  Oaxaca.  The  narrow  southwest  coastal  plain  extends 
from  the  Sierra  Madre  del  Sur  to  the  Pacific  Ocean.  The  Sierra 
Madre  de  Oaxaca  begins  at  Pico  de  Orizaba  and  extends  in  a 
southeasterly  direction  for  300  kilometers  until  reaching  the 
isthmus  of  Tehuantepec.  Peaks  in  the  Sierra  Madre  de  Oaxaca 
average  2,500  meters  in  elevation,  with  some  peaks  exceeding 
3,000  meters.  South  of  the  isthmus  of  Tehuantepec,  the  Sierra 
Madre  de  Chiapas  runs  280  kilometers  along  the  Pacific  Coast 
from  the  Oaxaca-Chiapas  border  to  Mexico's  border  with  Gua- 
temala. Although  average  elevation  is  only  1,500  meters,  one 
peak — Volcan  de  Tacuma — exceeds  4,000  meters  in  elevation. 
Finally,  the  Meseta  Central  de  Chiapas  extends  250  kilometers 
through  the  central  part  of  Chiapas  to  Guatemala.  The  average 
height  of  peaks  of  the  Meseta  Central  de  Chiapas  is  2,000 
meters.  The  Chiapas  central  valley  separates  the  Meseta  Cen- 
tral de  Chiapas  and  the  Sierra  Madre  de  Chiapas. 

Mexico  has  nearly  150  rivers,  two-thirds  of  which  empty  into 
the  Pacific  Ocean  and  the  remainder  of  which  flow  into  the 
Gulf  of  Mexico  or  the  Caribbean  Sea.  Despite  this  apparent 
abundance  of  water,  water  volume  is  unevenly  distributed 
throughout  the  country.  Indeed,  five  rivers — the  Usumacinta, 
Grijalva,  Papaloapan,  Coatzacoalcos,  and  Panuco — account  for 
52  percent  of  Mexico's  average  annual  volume  of  surface  water. 
All  five  rivers  flow  into  the  Gulf  of  Mexico;  only  the  Rio  Panuco 
is  outside  southeastern  Mexico,  which  contains  approximately 
15  percent  of  national  territory  and  12  percent  of  the  national 
population.  In  contrast,  northern  and  central  Mexico,  with  47

percent  of  the  national  area  and  almost  60  percent  of  Mexico's 
population,  have  less  than  10  percent  of  the  country's  water 
resources. 

Seismic  Activity 

Situated  atop  three  of  the  large  tectonic  plates  that  consti- 
tute the  earth's  surface,  Mexico  is  one  of  the  most  seismologi- 
cally  active  regions  on  earth.  The  motion  of  these  plates  causes 
earthquakes  and  volcanic  activity. 

Most  of  the  Mexican  landmass  rests  on  the  westward  moving 
North  American  plate.  The  Pacific  Ocean  floor  off  southern 
Mexico,  however,  is  being  carried  northeast  by  the  underlying 
motion  of  the  Cocos  plate.  Ocean  floor  material  is  relatively 
dense;  when  it  strikes  the  lighter  granite  of  the  Mexican  land- 
mass,  the  ocean  floor  is  forced  under  the  landmass,  creating 
the  deep  Middle  American  trench  that  lies  off  Mexico's  south- 
ern coast.  The  westward  moving  land  atop  the  North  American 
plate  is  slowed  and  crumpled  where  it  meets  the  Cocos  plate, 
creating  the  mountain  ranges  of  southern  Mexico.  The  sub- 
duction  of  the  Cocos  plate  accounts  for  the  frequency  of  earth- 
quakes near  Mexico's  southern  coast.  As  the  rocks  constituting 
the  ocean  floor  are  forced  down,  they  melt,  and  the  molten 
material  is  forced  up  through  weaknesses  in  the  surface  rock, 
creating  the  volcanoes  in  the  Cordillera  Neovolcanica  across 
central  Mexico. 

Areas  off  Mexico's  coastline  on  the  Gulf  of  California, 
including  the  Baja  California  Peninsula,  are  riding  northwest- 
ward on  the  Pacific  plate.  Rather  than  one  plate  subducting, 
the  Pacific  and  North  American  plates  grind  past  each  other, 
creating  a  slip  fault  that  is  the  southern  extension  of  the  San 
Andreas  fault  in  California.  Motion  along  this  fault  in  the  past 
pulled  Baja  California  away  from  the  coast,  creating  the  Gulf  of 
California.  Continued  motion  along  this  fault  is  the  source  of 
earthquakes  in  western  Mexico. 

Mexico  has  a  long  history  of  destructive  earthquakes  and 
volcanic  eruptions.  In  September  1985,  an  earthquake  measur- 
ing 8.1  on  the  Richter  scale  and  centered  in  the  subduction 
zone  off  Acapulco  killed  more  than  4,000  people  in  Mexico 
City,  more  than  300  kilometers  away.  Volcan  de  Colima,  south 
of  Guadalajara,  erupted  in  1994,  and  El  Chichon,  in  southern 
Mexico,  underwent  a  violent  eruption  in  1983.  Paricutin  in 
northwest  Mexico  began  as  puffs  of  smoke  in  a  cornfield  in 
1943;  a  decade  later  the  volcano  was  2,700  meters  high.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Although  dormant  for  decades,  Popocatepetl  and  Ixtaccihuatl 
("smoking  warrior"  and  "white  lady,"  respectively,  in  Nahuatl) 
occasionally  send  out  puffs  of  smoke  clearly  visible  in  Mexico 
City,  a  reminder  to  the  capital's  inhabitants  that  volcanic  activ- 
ity is  near.  Popocatepetl  showed  renewed  activity  in  1995  and 
1996,  forcing  the  evacuation  of  several  nearby  villages  and  caus- 
ing concern  by  seismologists  and  government  officials  about 
the  effect  that  a  large-scale  eruption  might  have  on  the  heavily 
populated  region  nearby. 

Climate 

The  Tropic  of  Cancer  effectively  divides  the  country  into 
temperate  and  tropical  zones.  Land  north  of  the  twenty-fourth 
parallel  experiences  cooler  temperatures  during  the  winter 
months.  South  of  the  twenty-fourth  parallel,  temperatures  are 
fairly  constant  year  round  and  vary  solely  as  a  function  of  eleva- 
tion. 

Areas  south  of  the  twentieth-fourth  parallel  with  elevations 
up  to  1,000  meters  (the  southern  parts  of  both  coastal  plains  as 
well  as  the  Yucatan  Peninsula),  have  a  yearly  median  tempera- 
ture between  24°C  and  28°C.  Temperatures  here  remain  high 
throughout  the  year,  with  only  a  5°C  difference  between  winter 
and  summer  median  temperatures.  Although  low-lying  areas 
north  of  the  twentieth-fourth  parallel  are  hot  and  humid  dur- 
ing the  summer,  they  generally  have  lower  yearly  temperature 
averages  (from  20°C  to  24°C)  because  of  more  moderate  condi- 
tions during  the  winter. 

Between  1,000  and  2,000  meters,  one  encounters  yearly  aver- 
age temperatures  between  16°C  and  20°C.  Towns  and  cities  at 
this  elevation  south  of  the  twenty-fourth  parallel  have  relatively 
constant,  pleasant  temperatures  throughout  the  year,  whereas 
more  northerly  locations  experience  sizeable  seasonal  varia- 
tions. Above  2,000  meters,  temperatures  drop  as  low  as  an  aver- 
age yearly  range  between  8°C  and  12°C  in  the  Cordillera 
Neovolcanica.  At  2,300  meters,  Mexico  City  has  a  yearly  median 
temperature  of  15°C  with  pleasant  summers  and  mild  winters. 
Average  daily  highs  and  lows  for  May,  the  warmest  month,  are 
26°C  and  12°C,  and  average  daily  highs  and  lows  for  January, 
the  coldest  month,  are  19°C  and  6°C. 

Rainfall  varies  widely  both  by  location  and  season.  Arid  or 
semiarid  conditions  are  encountered  in  the  Baja  Peninsula,  the 
northwestern  state  of  Sonora,  the  northern  altiplano,  and  sig- 
nificant portions  of  the  southern  altiplano.  Rainfall  in  these 


87 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

regions  averages  between  300  and  600  millimeters  per  year. 
Average  rainfall  totals  are  between  600  and  1,000  millimeters  in 
most  of  the  year  in  most  of  the  major  populated  areas  of  the 
southern  altiplano,  including  Mexico  City  and  Guadalajara. 
Low-lying  areas  along  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  receive  in  excess  of 
1,000  millimeters  of  rainfall  in  an  average  year,  with  the  wettest 
region  being  the  southeastern  state  of  Tabasco,  which  typically 
receives  approximately  2,000  millimeters  of  rainfall  on  an 
annual  basis.  Parts  of  the  northern  altiplano  and  high  peaks  in 
the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  and  the  Sierra  Madre  Oriental 
occasionally  receive  significant  snowfalls. 

Mexico  has  pronounced  wet  and  dry  seasons.  Most  of  the 
country  experiences  a  rainy  season  from  June  to  mid-October 
and  significantly  less  rain  during  the  remainder  of  the  year. 
February  and  July  generally  are  the  driest  and  wettest  months, 
respectively.  Mexico  City,  for  example,  receives  an  average  of 
only  5  millimeters  of  rain  during  February  but  more  than  160 
millimeters  in  July.  Coastal  areas,  especially  those  along  the 
Gulf  of  Mexico,  experience  the  largest  amounts  of  rain  in  Sep- 
tember. Tabasco  typically  records  more  than  300  millimeters  of 
rain  during  that  month.  A  small  coastal  area  of  northwestern 
coastal  Mexico  around  Tijuana  has  a  Mediterranean  climate 
with  considerable  coastal  fog  and  a  rainy  season  that  occurs  in 
winter. 

Mexico  lies  squarely  within  the  hurricane  belt,  and  all 
regions  of  both  coasts  are  susceptible  to  these  storms  from  June 
through  November.  Hurricanes  on  the  Pacific  coast  are  less  fre- 
quent and  often  less  violent  than  those  affecting  Mexico's  east- 
ern coastline.  Several  hurricanes  per  year  strike  the  Caribbean 
and  Gulf  of  Mexico  coastline,  however,  and  these  storms  bring 
high  winds,  heavy  rain,  extensive  damage,  and  occasional  loss 
of  life.  Hurricane  Hugo  passed  directly  over  Cancun  in  Sep- 
tember 1989,  with  winds  in  excess  of  200  kilometers  per  hour 
producing  major  damage  to  hotels  in  the  resort  area.  In  Sep- 
tember 1988,  Hurricane  Gilbert  struck  northeast  Mexico. 
Flooding  from  the  heavy  rain  in  that  storm  killed  dozens  in  the 
Monterrey  area  and  caused  extensive  damage  to  livestock  and 
vegetable  crops. 

Environmental  Conditions 

Mexico  faces  significant  environmental  challenges  affecting 
almost  every  section  of  the  country.  Vast  expanses  of  southern 
and  southeastern  tropical  forests  have  been  denuded  for 


88 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


cattle-raising  and  agriculture.  For  example,  tropical  forests  cov- 
ered almost  half  of  the  state  of  Tabasco  in  1940  but  less  than  10 
percent  by  the  late  1980s.  During  the  same  period,  pastureland 
increased  from  20  to  60  percent  of  the  state's  total  area.  Ana- 
lysts reported  similar  conditions  in  other  tropical  sections  of 
Mexico.  Deforestation  has  contributed  to  serious  levels  of  soil 
erosion  nationwide.  In  1985  the  government  classified  almost 
17  percent  of  all  land  as  totally  eroded,  31  percent  in  an  accel- 
erated state  of  erosion,  and  38  percent  demonstrating  signs  of 
incipient  erosion. 

Soil  destruction  is  particularly  pronounced  in  the  north  and 
northwest,  with  more  than  60  percent  of  land  considered  in  a 
total  or  accelerated  state  of  erosion.  Fragile  because  of  its  semi- 
arid  and  arid  character,  the  soil  of  the  region  has  become 
increasingly  damaged  through  excessive  cattle-raising  and  irri- 
gation with  waters  containing  high  levels  of  salinity.  The  result 
is  a  mounting  problem  of  desertification  throughout  the 
region. 

Mexico's  vast  coastline  faces  a  different,  but  no  less  difficult, 
series  of  environmental  problems.  For  example,  inadequately 
regulated  petroleum  exploitation  in  the  Coatzacoalcos-Minati- 
tlan  zone  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  has  caused  serious  damage  to 
the  waters  and  fisheries  of  Rio  Coatzacoalcos.  The  deadly 
explosion  that  racked  a  working-class  neighborhood  in  Gua- 
dalajara in  April  1992  serves  as  an  appropriate  symbol  of  envi- 
ronmental damage  in  Mexico.  More  than  1,000  barrels  of 
gasoline  seeped  from  a  corroded  Mexican  Petroleum  (Petro- 
leos  Mexicanos — Pemex)  pipeline  into  the  municipal  sewer  sys- 
tem, where  it  combined  with  gases  and  industrial  residuals  to 
produce  a  massive  explosion  that  killed  190  persons  and 
injured  nearly  1,500  others. 

Mexico  City  confronts  authorities  with  perhaps  their  most 
daunting  environmental  challenge.  Geography  and  extreme 
population  levels  have  combined  to  produce  one  of  the  world's 
most  polluted  urban  areas.  Mexico  City  sits  in  a  valley  sur- 
rounded on  three  sides  by  mountains,  which  serve  to  trap  con- 
taminants produced  by  the  metropolitan  area's  15  million 
residents.  One  government  study  in  the  late  1980s  determined 
that  nearly  5  million  tons  of  contaminants  were  emitted  annu- 
ally in  the  atmosphere,  a  tenfold  increase  over  the  previous 
decade.  Carbons  and  hydrocarbons  from  the  region's  more 
than  3  million  vehicles  account  for  approximately  80  percent 
of  these  contaminants,  with  another  15  percent,  primarily  of 


89 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

sulfur  and  nitrogen,  coming  from  industrial  plants.  During  the 
dry  winter  months,  untreated  fecal  matter  also  becomes  air- 
borne. The  resulting  dangerous  mix  is  responsible  for  a  wide 
range  of  respiratory  illnesses.  One  study  of  twelve  urban  areas 
worldwide  in  the  mid-1980s  concluded  that  the  residents  of 
Mexico  City  had  the  highest  levels  of  lead  and  cadmium  in 
their  blood.  The  volume  of  pollutants  from  Mexico  City  has 
damaged  the  surrounding  ecosystem  as  well.  For  example, 
wastewater  from  Mexico  City  that  flows  north  and  is  used  for 
irrigation  in  the  state  of  Hidalgo  has  been  linked  to  congenital 
birth  defects  and  high  levels  of  gastrointestinal  diseases  in  that 
state. 

Beginning  in  the  mid-1980s,  the  government  enacted 
numerous  antipollution  policies  in  Mexico  City  with  varied 
degrees  of  success.  Measures  such  as  vehicle  emissions  inspec- 
tions, the  introduction  of  unleaded  gasoline,  and  the  installa- 
tion of  catalytic  converters  on  new  vehicles  helped  reduce 
pollution  generated  by  trucks  and  buses.  In  contrast,  one  of 
the  government's  most  prominent  actions,  the  No  Driving  Day 
program,  may  have  inadvertently  contributed  to  higher  pollu- 
tion levels.  Under  the  program,  metropolitan  area  residents 
were  prohibited  from  driving  their  vehicles  one  day  each  work 
week  based  on  the  last  number  of  their  license  plate.  However, 
those  with  the  resources  to  do  so  purchased  additional  automo- 
biles to  use  on  the  day  their  principal  vehicle  was  prohibited 
from  driving,  thus  adding  to  the  region's  vehicle  stock.  Ther- 
mal inversions  reached  such  dangerous  levels  at  various  times 
in  the  mid-1990s  that  the  government  declared  pollution  emer- 
gencies, necessitating  sharp  temporary  cutbacks  in  vehicle  use 
and  industrial  production. 

Population 

The  eleventh  annual  census,  conducted  in  1990,  reported  a 
total  Mexican  population  of  81,250,000.  This  figure  repre- 
sented a  2.3  percent  per  annum  growth  rate  from  the  1980  cen- 
sus and  indicated  successful  government  efforts  at  slowing 
down  the  level  of  population  increase.  The  government 
reported  that  the  population  stood  at  91,158,000  at  the  end  of 
1995,  a  1.8  percent  increase  over  the  previous  year.  Assuming 
that  this  most  recent  level  of  growth  were  maintained  through 
the  rest  of  the  1990s,  Mexico's  population  would  stand  at 
approximately  100  million  persons  in  the  year  2000.  A  return 
to  the  higher  1980  to  1990  growth  rate,  however,  would  result 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


in  a  population  total  of  approximately  102  million  persons  by 
the  year  2000. 

The  pace  of  migration  to  the  United  States  increased  mark- 
edly during  the  1980s.  One  analyst,  Rodolfo  Corona  Vazquez, 
estimated  that  4.4  million  Mexicans  resided  outside  the  coun- 
try (almost  all  in  the  United  States)  in  1990,  roughly  double 
the  estimated  number  in  1980.  Corona  Vazquez  also  noted  a 
changing  pattern  of  emigration  since  the  1960s.  Seven  contigu- 
ous states  in  north  central  Mexico — -Jalisco,  Michoacan,  Guana- 
juato, Zacatecas,  Durango,  San  Luis  Potosi,  and  Aguasca- 
lientes — accounted  for  approximately  70  percent  of  all  emi- 
grants in  1960,  but  only  42  percent  in  1990.  New  important 
sources  of  emigration  included  Chihuahua  in  the  northeast, 
the  Federal  District  (the  administrative  unit  that  includes 
Mexico  City),  and  the  southernmost  state  of  Oaxaca. 

Notable  variations  exist  in  the  country's  population  density 
(see  fig.  4).  Four  states,  three  of  them  in  the  arid  northwest, 
had  fewer  than  ten  persons  per  square  kilometer  in  1990,  and 
another  thirteen  states,  mostly  in  the  north,  had  density  levels 
between  ten  and  fifty  persons  per  square  kilometer.  By  con- 
trast, two  states  clustered  near  the  capital  had  densities  in 
excess  of  200  persons  per  square  kilometer.  The  rate  in  Mexico 
City  itself  was  approximately  5,500  persons  per  square  kilome- 
ter (see  table  2,  Appendix) . 

The  state  of  Mexico  and  the  Federal  District  accounted  for 
over  22  percent  of  the  national  population  in  1990.  The  state 
of  Mexico's  spectacular  population  growth  (the  state  alone 
accounted  for  more  than  12  percent  of  national  totals) 
reflected  the  expansion  of  the  Mexico  City  metropolitan  area. 
Almost  69  percent  of  the  state  of  Mexico's  population  resided 
in  the  twenty-seven  municipalities  that,  together  with  the  Fed- 
eral District,  comprise  the  Mexico  City  metropolitan  area. 
More  than  40  percent  of  state  residents  lived  in  four 
working-class  municipalities — Nezahualcoyotl,  Ecatepec,  Nau- 
calpan,  and  Tlalnepantla — that  serve  as  bedroom  communities 
for  Mexico  City. 

During  the  course  of  its  history,  Mexico  has  experienced 
dramatic  shifts  in  population.  Demographers  estimate  that  the 
country's  population  at  the  time  of  the  Spanish  conquest  in  the 
early  1500s  was  approximately  20  million.  By  1600,  however, 
barely  1  million  remained — the  result  of  deadly  European  dis- 
eases and  brutal  treatment  of  the  indigenous  inhabitants  by  the 
Spanish  colonizers  (see  New  Spain,  ch.  1).  At  the  onset  of  the 


91 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Mexican  Revolution  in  1910,  Mexico's  population  stood  at 
approximately  15  million  persons.  Not  until  1940  did  Mexico 
reach  the  population  level  it  had  in  1519. 

Although  the  population  growth  between  1910  and  1940 
appeared  relatively  modest  in  absolute  numbers,  the  seeds 
were  sown  for  a  spectacular  increase  over  the  next  thirty  years. 
Because  of  advances  in  preventive  medicine  and  the  gradual 
control  of  diseases  such  as  yellow  fever,  the  crude  death  rate 
declined  from  33.2  per  1,000  inhabitants  in  the  period  1905  to 
1910  to  23.4  in  1940  (see  table  3,  Appendix).  As  sanitation  con- 
ditions improved  in  post-World  War  II  Mexico,  the  crude  death 
rate  dropped  sharply  to  10.1  by  1970.  At  the  same  time,  how- 
ever, fertility  rates  (the  number  of  children  the  average  woman 
would  bear  from  fifteen  to  forty-nine  years  of  age)  remained 
relatively  stable.  Because  of  the  stable  fertility  rate  and  declin- 
ing death  rate,  the  population  increased  by  2.7  percent  per 
annum  between  1940  and  1950,  by  3.1  percent  per  annum 
between  1950  and  1960,  and  by  3.4  percent  per  annum 
between  1960  and  1970.  By  1970  Mexico's  population  stood  at 
approximately  48.2  million  persons,  almost  two  and  one-half 
times  its  pre-World  War  II  number.  Demographers  in  1970  omi- 
nously forecast  that  the  population  would  reach  125  million 
persons  by  the  year  2000. 

Shortly  after  assuming  the  presidency  in  1976,  Jose  Lopez 
Portillo  y  Pacheco  (1976-82)  adopted  an  aggressive  national 
family  planning  program.  This  effort  paid  immediate  divi- 
dends by  reducing  Mexico's  fertility  rate  from  5.4  in  1976  to  4.6 
in  1979.  The  family  planning  initiative  produced  a  fundamen- 
tal change  in  attitudes  that  continued  and  accelerated  into  the 
1990s.  Indeed,  the  government  reported  that  the  fertility  rate 
had  declined  to  2.9  in  1993.  This  lower  fertility  rate  produced  a 
slightly  older  average  population  in  1990,  compared  with  two 
decades  earlier.  In  1970,  46.2  percent  of  all  Mexicans  were 
younger  than  fifteen  years  of  age,  and  56.7  percent  were  under 
twenty  years  of  age.  By  1990,  these  numbers  had  dropped  to 
38.3  and  50.6  percent,  respectively  (see  fig.  5). 

Ethnicity  and  Language 

Ethnicity  is  an  important  yet  highly  imprecise  concept  in 
contemporary  Mexico.  Students  of  Mexican  society,  as  well  as 
Mexicans  themselves,  identify  two  broad  ethnic  groups  based 
on  cultural  rather  than  racial  differences:  mestizos  and  Indi- 
ans. Each  group  has  a  distinct  cultural  viewpoint  and  perceives

itself  as  different  from  the  other.  At  the  same  time,  however, 
group  allegiances  may  change,  making  measurement  of  ethnic 
composition  problematic  at  best. 

Originally  racial  designators,  the  terms  mestizo  and  Indian 
have  lost  almost  all  of  their  previous  racial  connotation  and  are 
now  used  entirely  to  designate  cultural  groups.  Historically,  the 
term  mestizo  described  someone  with  mixed  European  and 
indigenous  heritage.  Mestizos  occupied  a  middle  social  stratum 
between  whites  and  pure-blooded  indigenous  people  (see 
Socieconomic  Structures,  ch.  1).  Whites  themselves  were 
divided  into  criollo  (those  born  in  the  New  World)  and  peninsu- 
lar (those  born  in  Spain)  subgroups.  In  contemporary  usage, 
however,  the  word  mestizo  refers  to  anyone  who  has  adopted 
Mexican  Hispanic  culture.  Seen  in  this  cultural  context,  both 
those  with  a  solely  European  background  and  those  with  a 
mixed  European-indigenous  background  are  automatically 
referred  to  as  mestizos.  Mestizo,  then,  has  become  a  synonym 
for  culturally  Mexican,  much  as  ladino  is  used  in  many  Latin 
American  countries  for  those  who  are  culturally  Hispanic. 
Members  of  indigenous  groups  also  may  be  called  (and  may 
call  themselves)  mestizos  if  they  have  the  dominant  Hispanic 
societal  cultural  values. 

If  an  indigenous  person  can  become  a  mestizo,  who,  then,  is 
an  Indian?  Anthropologist  Alan  Sandstorm  lists  minimum  cri- 
teria that  compose  a  definition  of  Indian  ethnicity.  According 
to  Sandstorm,  an  Indian  is  someone  who  identifies  himself  as 
such;  chooses  to  use  an  indigenous  language  in  daily  speech; 
remains  actively  involved  in  village  communal  affairs;  partici- 
pates in  religious  ceremonies  rooted  in  native  American  tradi- 
tions; and  attempts  to  achieve  a  harmony  with,  rather  than 
control  over,  the  social  and  natural  worlds.  Should  one  or  more 
criteria  become  absent  over  time,  the  individual  probably  has 
begun  the  transition  to  becoming  a  mestizo. 

Although  mestizos  and  Indians  may  both  reside  in  rural 
areas  and  have  relatively  comparable  levels  of  income,  they 
maintain  different  lives.  Such  differences  can  lead  to  highly 
negative  perceptions  about  each  other.  Mestizos  often  contend 
that  Indians  are  too  unmotivated  and  constrained  by  tradition 
to  deal  appropriately  with  the  demands  of  modern  society. 
Indians,  in  turn,  frequently  complain  that  mestizos  are  aggres- 
sive, impatient,  and  disrespectful  toward  nature. 

Given  the  cultural  use  of  the  terms,  it  would  be  unrealistic  to 
expect  Mexican  census  officials  to  count  the  number  of  mesti-

zos  and  Indians  based  on  racial  criteria.  However,  in  measuring 
how  many  people  speak  an  indigenous  language,  the  census  at 
least  serves  to  identify  a  minimum  number  of  racially  unmixed 
Indians.  In  1990,  7.5  percent  of  the  Mexican  population,  or 
approximately  5.3  million  people  five  years  of  age  and  over, 
spoke  an  Indian  language.  Of  that  total,  approximately  79  per- 
cent knew  Spanish  as  well  and  thus  were  at  least  potential  cul- 
tural converts  to  the  mestizo  world. 

Enormous  statewide  differences  exist  in  familiarity  with 
indigenous  languages  (see  fig.  6).  Roughly  speaking,  familiarity 
with  indigenous  languages  increases  from  north  to  south.  The 
latest  census  showed  that  almost  no  native  speakers  lived  in  a 
band  of  eight  contiguous  states  stretching  from  Coahuila  in  the 
northeast  to  Jalisco  and  Colima  along  the  north-central  Pacific 
coast.  Speakers  of  indigenous  languages  constituted  less  than  5 
percent  of  the  population  in  states  in  the  far  northwest  and 
along  a  central  belt  of  states  from  Michoacan  in  the  west  to 


96 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Tlaxcala  in  the  east.  The  percentage  climbed  to  between  10 
and  20  percent  in  another  contiguous  grouping  of  states  from 
San  Luis  Potosi  to  Guerrero,  to  26  percent  in  Oaxaca,  to  32 
and  39  percent,  respectively,  in  Quintana  Roo  and  Chiapas, 
and  to  44  percent  in  Yucatan.  Only  63  percent  of  users  of  indig- 
enous languages  in  Chiapas  also  knew  Spanish. 

Specialists  have  identified  twelve  distinct  Mexican  linguistic 
families,  more  than  forty  subgroups,  and  more  than  ninety 
individual  languages.  Nearly  23  percent  of  all  native  speakers 
speak  Nahuatl,  the  language  of  the  Aztec  people  and  the  only 
indigenous  language  found  in  fifteen  states.  Other  major  indig- 
enous languages  include  Maya  (spoken  by  approximately  14 
percent  of  all  Indians  and  primarily  used  in  the  southeast  from 
the  Yucatan  Peninsula  to  Chiapas);  Zapotec  (spoken  by 
approximately  7  percent  of  all  Indians  and  largely  used  in  the 
eastern  part  of  Oaxaca);  Mixtec  (also  spoken  by  approximately 
7  percent  of  all  Indians  and  primarily  found  in  Oaxaca  and 
Guerrero);  Otomf  (spoken  by  approximately  5  percent  of  all 
Indians  and  used  in  central  Mexico,  especially  the  states  of 
Mexico,  Hidalgo,  and  Queretaro) ;  Tzeltal  (spoken  by  nearly  5 
percent  of  all  Indians  and  used  in  Chiapas);  and  Tzotzil  (spo- 
ken by  roughly  4  percent  of  the  Indian  population  and  also 
used  in  Chiapas).  With  twelve  different  Indian  languages, 
Oaxaca  has  the  nation's  most  diverse  linguistic  pattern. 

Census  data  reveal  that  Indians  remain  the  most  marginal- 
ized sector  of  Mexican  society.  More  than  40  percent  of  the 
Indian  population  fifteen  years  of  age  and  older  was  illiterate 
in  1990,  roughly  three  times  the  national  rate.  Thirty  percent 
of  Indian  children  between  six  and  fourteen  years  of  age  did 
not  attend  school.  Indians  also  had  significantly  higher  mor- 
bidity and  mortality  rates  associated  with  infectious  and  para- 
sitic illness,  higher  levels  of  nutritional  deficiencies,  and  less 
access  to  such  basic  services  as  indoor  plumbing,  piped  water, 
and  electricity. 

Income  Distribution 

In  the  mid-1990s,  Mexico  had  a  highly  inequitable  distribu- 
tion of  income,  a  pattern  that,  according  to  government  statis- 
tics, became  particularly  skewed  during  the  economic  crisis  of 
the  1980s.  The  country's  continuing  inability  to  create  suffi- 
cient employment  opportunities  for  its  labor  force  has  pro- 
duced high  levels  of  unemployment  and  underemployment 
and  has  required  aggressive  survival  strategies  among  Mexico's 


97 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

poor.  Such  strategies  include  sending  more  family  members, 
even  children,  into  the  labor  market  and  reducing  consump- 
tion of  basic  commodities. 

The  1990  census  reported  a  total  national  workforce  of  24.3 
million  people.  Although  population  growth  slowed  to  around 
2  percent  per  annum  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  analysts  esti- 
mated that  the  workforce  expanded  by  up  to  4  percent  per 
annum  over  the  same  period.  Workforce  expansion  is  expected 
to  remain  at  these  rates  through  the  late  1990s,  as  those  born 
during  the  peak  fertility  years  of  1970-76  come  of  age.  Thus, 
Mexico  will  need  approximately  1  million  new  jobs  each  year 
through  the  remainder  of  the  1990s  to  provide  work  for  per- 
sons entering  the  job  market.  During  the  early  1990s,  however, 
net  job  growth  was  believed  to  have  been  less  than  500,000  per 
annum. 

Approximately  10  percent  of  all  Mexicans  can  be  character- 
ized as  belonging  to  the  upper-  and  upper-middle-income  sec- 
tors, consisting  of  the  nation's  business  executives  and 
government  leaders.  Upper-income  Mexicans  are  both  highly 
urbanized  and  well  educated.  Government  surveys  of  house- 
hold income  revealed  that  these  groups  absorbed  an  increasing 
share  of  wealth  during  the  1980s.  The  top  10  percent  of  the 
population  accounted  for  33  percent  of  all  income  in  1984  and 
38  percent  in  1992. 

The  middle  sector  comprises  approximately  30  percent  of 
the  nation.  Like  its  upper-income  counterparts,  this  sector  is 
largely  urban  and  has  educational  levels  superior  to  the 
national  average.  It  consists  of  professionals,  mid-level  govern- 
ment and  private-sector  employees,  office  workers,  shopkeep- 
ers, and  other  nonmanual  workers.  The  middle-sector  share  of 
overall  income  declined  from  39  percent  in  1984  to  36  percent 
in  1992.  Inflation  seriously  eroded  the  purchasing  power  of  the 
middle  class  during  that  period,  causing  many  to  modify  their 
buying  habits  and  to  withdraw  from  private  education  and 
health  care  systems. 

The  remaining  60  percent  of  Mexicans  make  up  the  lower 
sector,  itself  a  heterogeneous  group  of  industrial  workers, 
informal-sector  employees,  and  peasants.  Of  these,  industrial 
workers  have  the  most  favored  situation,  reflecting  both  their 
higher  wage  scale  and  membership  in  the  health  care  system 
and  retirement  or  disability  programs  of  the  Mexican  Institute 
of  Social  Security  (Instituto  Mexicano  del  Seguro  Social — 
IMSS)  (see  Health  and  Social  Security,  this  ch.).  However,

industrial  workers  also  experienced  a  decline  in  purchasing 
power  and  share  of  national  income  during  the  1980s.  Overall, 
the  bottom  60  percent  of  the  population  saw  its  share  of  total 
income  fall  from  29  percent  in  1984  to  26  percent  in  1992. 

Analysts  estimate  that  the  informal  sector  of  the  economy 
represents  from  30  to  40  percent  of  the  urban  workforce  in  the 
mid-1990s.  Informal-sector  workers  are  self-employed  or  work 
in  small  firms  (during  1993,  businesses  with  one  to  five  employ- 
ees accounted  for  42  percent  of  the  urban  workforce).  They 
face  considerable  job  instability,  and,  unlike  those  in  the  for- 
mal sector,  are  effectively  excluded  from  IMSS  benefits.  The 
informal  sector  includes  street  vendors,  domestic  servants, 
pieceworkers  in  small  establishments,  and  most  construction 
workers. 

During  the  early  1990s,  Mexico  reported  unemployment 
rates  of  between  3  and  4  percent.  These  rates,  based  on  surveys 
of  conditions  in  Mexico's  three  dozen  largest  cities,  excluded 
those  who  had  ceased  looking  for  work  over  the  previous  two 
months,  as  well  as  those  working  only  a  few  hours  per  week.  A 
much  more  accurate  government  measure  of  unemployment 
and  underemployment  includes  both  the  unemployed  and 
those  who  work  less  than  thirty-five  hours  per  week.  This  level 
of  urban  partial  employment  and  unemployment  stood  at 
around  20  percent  during  the  early  1990s.  The  government 
does  not  measure  rural  unemployment  or  underemployment, 
where  rates  are  regarded  by  analysts  as  significantly  higher  than 
those  found  in  urban  Mexico. 

According  to  government  statistics,  the  vast  majority  of 
urban  workers  in  the  early  1990s  earned  less  than  US$15  per 
day.  Minimum  wage  rates  vary  according  to  region  and  are 
adjusted  every  January  to  account  for  inflation.  If  inflation 
rates  are  high,  labor  groups  can  ask  the  regulatory  committee, 
the  Tripartite  National  Minimum  Wage  Commission,  to  con- 
sider an  additional  raise  during  the  year.  In  December  1995  in 
Mexico  City,  the  daily  minimum  wage  stood  at  20.15  new  pesos, 
or  US$2. 70  (for  value  of  new  peso — see  Glossary).  In  1993  the 
government  reported  that  10  percent  of  workers  earned  less 
than  the  minimum  wage,  34.7  percent  made  between  one  and 
two  times  the  minimum  wage,  and  36.5  percent  received 
between  two  and  five  times  the  minimum  wage. 

Government  surveys  of  household  income  in  1984  and  1989 
revealed  a  worsening  pattern  of  income  distribution.  As  noted 
by  economist  Rodolfo  de  la  Torre,  the  poorest  30  percent  of 


101 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

the  population  had  only  9  percent  of  total  national  income  in 
1984,  a  figure  that  had  dropped  to  8.1  percent  in  the  1989  sur- 
vey. The  poorest  half  saw  its  share  of  income  drop  from  20.8 
percent  in  1984  to  18.8  percent  in  1989.  The  middle  30  per- 
cent of  the  population  controlled  29.7  percent  of  the  total 
income  in  1984  but  only  27  percent  in  1989.  In  contrast,  the 
wealthiest  20  percent  received  49.5  percent  of  all  income  in 
1984  and  53.6  percent  in  1989.  Income  for  the  top  10  percent 
alone  increased  from  32.8  percent  in  1984  to  37.9  percent  five 
years  later. 

Throughout  1995  Mexico  experienced  a  sharp  economic 
contraction.  Observers  estimated  that  approximately  1  million 
jobs  were  lost  during  this  period.  Official  unemployment  rates 
skyrocketed  to  more  than  6  percent  for  the  year.  Interest  rates 
also  rose  sharply  in  the  wake  of  several  currency  devaluations. 
Millions  of  Mexicans  with  adjustable-rate  mortgages  or  substan- 
tial credit-card  debt  were  particularly  hard  hit.  Analysts  sug- 
gested that  the  events  of  1995  may  have  contributed  to  a 
further  skewing  of  income  distribution,  with  the  wealthiest 
Mexicans  more  able  to  weather  the  economic  storm  because 
their  capital  often  resided  abroad. 

Structure  of  Society 

Social  Indicators 

In  the  early  1990s,  Mexico  reported  substantial  improve- 
ment in  overall  living  conditions  compared  with  the  previous 
twenty  years.  The  1990  census  demonstrated  expanded  access 
to  basic  public  services  such  as  running  water  and  indoor 
plumbing.  It  also  revealed,  however,  that  Mexicans  had  not 
shared  equally  in  these  improvements,  with  southern  Mexico 
consistently  lagging  behind  the  rest  of  the  nation  in  quality-of- 
life  indicators.  In  addition,  rural  living  conditions  countrywide 
paled  in  comparison  to  those  found  in  urban  areas. 

According  to  the  1990  census,  79.4  percent  of  all  Mexican 
households  had  access  to  running  water,  a  notable  improve- 
ment from  the  61  percent  and  70.3  percent  rates  recorded  in 
1970  and  1980,  respectively.  Significantly,  however,  access  to 
running  water  did  not  necessarily  mean  indoor  plumbing. 
Indeed,  a  household  whose  residents  obtained  water  from  a 
piped  system  elsewhere  on  the  property  or  from  a  public  faucet 
were  considered  to  have  access  to  running  water.  In  addition, 
the  census  did  not  measure  the  quality  or  quantity  of  piped 


102 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


water.  Many  lower-class  communities  had  access  only  to 
untreated  running  water,  and  even  that  for  only  a  portion  of 
each  day. 

Even  using  the  broad  definition  of  access  to  running  water, 
wide  variations  emerged.  Four  states  in  southern  Mexico — 
Chiapas,  Oaxaca,  Guerrero,  and  Tabasco — reported  access  lev- 
els below  the  1970  national  average.  Access  to  running  water 
was  especially  low  in  rural  communities.  Only  48.1  percent  of 
all  communal  farming  communities  or  ejidos  (see  Glossary) 
nationwide  reported  access  in  1988,  with  levels  below  30  per- 
cent for  ejidos  in  Veracruz  and  Yucatan,  and  below  40  percent 
for  ejidos  in  Chiapas,  San  Luis  Potosi,  Tabasco,  and  Tamaulipas 
(see  Rural  Society,  this  ch.). 

Similar  variations  also  were  evident  in  a  number  of  other 
social  indicators.  Nationally,  63.6  percent  of  all  households  had 
indoor  plumbing  in  1990,  as  compared  with  41.4  percent  and 
50.7  percent  in  1970  and  1980,  respectively.  However,  indoor 
plumbing  rates  ranged  from  more  than  90  percent  in  Mexico 
City  to  less  than  40  percent  in  Oaxaca  and  Chiapas.  National 
household  access  to  electricity  climbed  from  58.9  percent  in 
1970  to  74.4  percent  in  1980  and  to  87.5  percent  in  1990.  Yet 
although  Aguascalientes,  Nuevo  Leon,  and  Mexico  City 
reported  rates  exceeding  95  percent  in  1990,  less  than  70  per- 
cent of  all  Chiapas  households  had  electricity.  Only  68.3  per- 
cent of  all  ejido  communities  had  electricity  in  1988,  with  rates 
below  60  percent  for  ejidos  in  Chiapas,  San  Luis  Potosi,  Vera- 
cruz, and  Yucatan,  and  below  50  percent  for  ejidos  in  Chihua- 
hua. 

Finally,  19.5  percent  of  all  households  had  dirt  flooring  in 
1990,  a  notable  improvement  from  the  41.1  percent  average  in 
1970  and  the  25.8  percent  average  in  1980.  Again,  however, 
jurisdictions  reported  enormous  disparities.  Although  Mexico 
City  and  five  northern  states — Aguascalientes,  Baja  California, 
Coahuila,  Chihuahua,  and  Nuevo  Leon — had  levels  below  10 
percent,  more  than  40  percent  of  all  households  in  the  south- 
ern states  of  Chiapas  and  Guerrero  and  more  than  50  percent 
of  all  households  in  Oaxaca  had  dirt  floors. 

Social  Spending 

Analysts  have  offered  widely  varied  assessments  of  the  magni- 
tude of  poverty  in  Mexico.  The  United  Nations  Economic 
Commission  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  estimated  in 
1989  that  39  percent  of  all  Mexican  households  were  in  pov- 


103 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

erty,  including  14  percent  in  extreme  poverty  (indigence).  The 
National  Solidarity  Program  (Programa  Nacional  de  Solidari- 
dad — Pronasol)  reported  that  51  percent  of  the  population  in 
1987  fell  below  the  poverty  line,  of  which  21  percent  were 
extremely  poor.  Mexican  author  Julieta  Campos  asserted  that 
approximately  60  percent  of  all  Mexicans  in  1988  were  poor, 
including  25  percent  indigent. 

Despite  these  numerical  differences,  analysts  generally  agree 
on  basic  trends  and  characteristics.  First,  poverty  levels 
declined  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  but  escalated  in  the  wake  of 
the  economic  crisis  that  began  in  1982  and  continued  for  most 
of  that  decade.  For  example,  Pronasol  estimated  that  poverty 
levels  declined  from  76  percent  in  1960  to  54  percent  in  1977 
and  to  45  percent  in  1981  before  substantially  increasing  over 
the  next  six  years.  Second,  indigence  has  its  roots  in  the  ram- 
pant economic  problems  of  the  countryside.  Economist  San- 
tiago Levy  estimated  that  approximately  three-quarters  of  all 
rural  residents  in  the  late  1980s  were  extremely  poor.  In  addi- 
tion, the  urban  poor  often  have  migrated  from  the  countryside 
in  search  of  opportunities  for  themselves  and  their  families. 
Third,  the  indigent  often  suffer  from  nutritional  deficiencies 
and  other  health  maladies  that  contribute  to  lower  life  expect- 
ancy than  the  population  as  a  whole.  Finally,  those  in  extreme 
poverty  have  larger  families;  children  are  expected  to  work  to 
help  support  the  household. 

Mexican  governments  over  the  years  have  introduced 
numerous  antipoverty  initiatives,  with  varying  degrees  of  suc- 
cess. In  1977  the  Lopez  Portillo  administration  established  the 
General  Coordination  of  the  National  Plan  for  Depressed 
Zones  and  Marginal  Groups  (Coordinacion  General  del  Plan 
Nacional  de  Zonas  Deprimidas  y  Grupos  Marginales — 
Coplamar).  An  umbrella  organization,  Coplamar  developed 
linkages  with  numerous  existing  government  agencies  for 
improvements  in  health  care,  education,  and  other  basic  infra- 
structure. For  example,  approximately  2,000  rural  health  clin- 
ics were  built  under  the  auspices  of  IMSS-Coplamar.  The 
National  Company  of  Popular  Subsistence  (Compama  Nacio- 
nal de  Subsistencias  Populares — Conasupo)-Coplamar  estab- 
lished thousands  of  stores  that  sold  basic  products  to  low- 
income  families  at  subsidized  prices.  Although  many  of  its  pro- 
grams were  reduced  or  eliminated  after  1982,  Coplamar  con- 
tributed to  a  noteworthy,  although  temporary,  reduction  in 
poverty.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

In  his  November  1993  State  of  the  Nation  address,  President 
Salinas  announced  that  government  spending  on  social 
projects  had  risen  85  percent  in  real  terms  between  1989  and 
1993.  Spending  for  education  rose  90  percent;  for  health,  79 
percent;  and  for  environment,  urban  development,  and  distri- 
bution of  drinking  water,  65  percent.  Much  of  that  social 
spending  was  channeled  through  Pronasol,  an  umbrella  orga- 
nization established  by  Salinas  in  December  1988  to  promote 
improved  health,  education,  nutrition,  housing,  employment, 
infrastructure,  and  other  productive  projects  to  benefit  those 
living  in  extreme  poverty. 

Salinas  claimed  that  Pronasol  marked  a  departure  from  pre- 
vious policies  of  broad  subsidies,  high  levels  of  unfocused  gov- 
ernment spending,  and  heavy  state  intervention  in  the 
economy.  According  to  Denise  Dresser,  it  advanced  President 
Salinas's  goal  of  adapting  the  state's  traditional  social  role  to 
the  straitened  economic  conditions  of  the  late  1980s  and  early 
1990s  by  replacing  general  subsidies  with  strategic,  targeted 
intervention.  Salinas  designed  Pronasol  to  achieve  the  dual 
objectives  of  making  social  spending  more  cost-effective  and 
fostering  greater  community  involvement  and  initiative  in  local 
development  projects.  The  main  themes  of  Pronasol  included 
grassroots  participation  and  minimum  bureaucracy  (both  of 
which  are  essential  for  project  success)  and  the  promise  of 
immediate  results.  The  federal  government  provided  financing 
and  raw  materials  for  improving  basic  community  services, 
although  community  members  were  required  to  conceive  the 
projects  and  perform  the  work. 

Approximately  250,000  grassroots  Pronasol  committees 
designed  projects  in  collaboration  with  government  staff  to 
address  community  needs.  They  mobilized  and  organized  com- 
munity members,  evaluated  proposed  public  works,  and  super- 
vised implementation.  The  government  disbursed  funds  to  the 
committees  to  finance  the  public  works  projects  or  to  comple- 
ment regional  development  programs,  which  fell  within  three 
strategic  areas:  social  services,  production,  and  regional  devel- 
opment. Committees  obtained  matching  funds  from  state  and 
municipal  governments  in  order  to  qualify  for  Pronasol  funds. 
This  match  served  to  multiply  the  economic  scale  and  the 
potential  positive  impact  of  the  program. 

Pronasol's  social  service  aspect,  Solidarity  for  Social  Well- 
being  (Solidaridad  para  el  Bienestar  Social),  contained  a  wide 
range  of  programs  that  included  education,  health  care,  water, 


106 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


sewerage,  and  electrification  projects;  urbanization  improve- 
ments; and  low-income  housing.  Over  a  six-year  span,  Pronasol 
created  some  80,000  new  classrooms  and  workshops  and  reno- 
vated 120,000  schools;  awarded  scholarships  to  keep  nearly  1.2 
million  indigent  children  in  primary  schools;  established  more 
than  300  hospitals,  4,000  health  centers,  and  some  1,000  rural 
medical  units;  provided  piped  water  access  for  approximately 
16  million  people;  and  provided  materials  to  repair  or  rein- 
force 500,000  low-income  homes  and  build  nearly  200,000  new 
homes.  Solidarity  for  Production  (Solidaridad  para  la  Produc- 
tion) provided  loans  to  approximately  1  million  peasants  who 
did  not  qualify  for  government  or  private  credits,  established 
2,000  low-income  credit  unions,  and  supported  some  250,000 
low-income  coffee  producers  (80  percent  of  them  Indians)  and 
nearly  400,000  agricultural  day  laborers  (jornaleros) .  Solidarity 
for  Regional  Development  (Solidaridad  para  el  Desarrollo 
Regional)  funded  the  construction  or  renovation  of  200,000 
kilometers  of  roads  and  more  than  100,000  municipal  improve- 
ment projects. 

Despite  these  achievements,  critics  contended  that  Pronasol 
was  merely  a  politicized  repackaging  of  traditional  welfare  and 
public  works  projects  that  ameliorated  but  did  not  address  the 
root  causes  of  poverty  in  Mexico.  In  the  view  of  these  critics, 
Pronasol's  raison  d'etre  was  to  enable  Salinas  and  his  support- 
ers to  build  new  political  linkages  with  autonomous  low-income 
interest  groups,  thereby  revitalizing  the  Institutional  Revolu- 
tionary Party  (Partido  Revolucionario  Institucional — PRI)  for 
future  elections.  Despite  Pronasol's  stated  purpose,  critics  also 
maintained  that  resources  often  did  not  reach  those  in 
extreme  poverty.  In  1995  President  Ernesto  Zedillo  restruc- 
tured Pronasol  as  the  Alliance  for  Well-being  (Alianca  para  el 
Bienestar),  strengthening  the  resource  allocation  roles  of  states 
and  municipalities  and  reducing  those  of  the  presidency. 

Urban  Society 

At  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century,  only  10.5  percent 
of  the  national  population  lived  in  localities  with  more  than 
15,000  residents.  A  slow  but  steady  increase  of  such  urban  com- 
munities occurred  over  the  next  four  decades,  accounting  for 
20  percent  of  the  country's  total  population  in  1940.  They 
climbed  rapidly  to  27.9  percent  in  1950,  36.5  percent  in  1960, 
44.7  percent  in  1970,  51.8  percent  in  1980,  and  57.4  percent  in 


107 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

1990.  An  estimated  71  percent  of  all  Mexicans  lived  in  commu- 
nities of  at  least  2,500  residents  in  1990. 

Thre*:  cities — Mexico  City,  Guadalajara,  and  Monterrey — 
dominated  the  urban  landscape  in  the  mid-1990s.  Their  metro- 
politan areas  accounted  for  about  one-fourth  of  the  nation's 
population  and  more  than  40  percent  of  the  total  urban  popu- 
lation. Nonetheless,  the  highest  growth  rates  between  1970  and 
1990  occurred  in  cities  containing  populations  ranging  from 
100,000  to  1  million.  Roughly  23  percent  of  the  nation  resided 
in  Mexico's  fifty-six  mid-level  cities  in  1990. 

With  15  million  residents  reported  in  the  1990  census,  the 
Mexico  City  metropolitan  area  alone  contained  18.5  percent  of 
the  total  national  population.  However,  the  metropolitan  area 
expanded  only  5.8  percent  from  1980  to  1990,  far  below  the  2.3 
percent  per  annum  national  population  growth  rate  over  the 
same  period.  The  population  of  Mexico  City  itself  declined 
from  9.2  million  in  1980  to  8.2  million  in  1990,  a  10.9  percent 
reduction.  This  decline  probably  reflected  both  dislocations 
experienced  by  low-income,  center-city  residents  following  the 
1985  earthquake  and  contracting  employment  opportunities 
during  the  economic  crisis  of  the  1980s.  However,  one  analyst, 
Alfonso  X.  Iracheta  Cenecorta,  contends  that  Mexico  City 
should  be  viewed  not  as  a  single  metropolitan  area  but  rather 
as  an  emerging  megalopolis  also  incorporating  the  cities  and 
surrounding  environs  of  Puebla,  Toluca,  and  Cuernavaca.  Seen 
from  this  perspective,  the  region  continued  to  grow  during  the 
1980s,  and  included  slightly  more  than  17  million  people  in 
1990. 

To  relieve  the  strains  of  rapid  growth  on  Mexico's  largest  cit- 
ies, the  Salinas  administration  encouraged  businesses  and  gov- 
ernment agencies  to  move  their  operations  from  the  major 
metropolitan  areas  to  mid-level  cities.  During  the  1980s, 
mid-level  cities  experienced  the  nation's  highest  growth  rates. 
Several  cities  in  northern  Mexico,  especially  along  the  border 
with  the  United  States,  were  particularly  dynamic  during  this 
period.  They  included  Torreon,  Tijuana,  Mexicali,  Matamoros, 
and  Ciudad  Juarez.  Other  rapidly  expanding  cities  included 
Cuernavaca  and  Jalapa  near  the  capital,  and  Tampico  and 
Coatzacoalcos  on  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  coast. 

The  dramatic  growth  of  cities  over  the  past  forty  years  has 
seriously  taxed  the  nation's  ability  to  build  urban  infrastruc- 
ture, especially  housing.  Adequate  and  affordable  housing 
emerged  as  a  paramount  concern  of  low-income  residents  after

1940.  Prior  to  that  time,  most  urban  poor  lived  in  center-city 
rental  units.  Real  estate  investors  frequently  converted  deterio- 
rating colonial  structures  into  vecindades  (sing.,  vecindad).  A 
vecindad  typically  consists  of  a  large  number  of  rented  rooms 
constructed  around  an  interior  open  area.  Residents  share 
kitchen  and  bathroom  facilities,  often  of  marginal  quality.  Fol- 
lowing institution  of  rent  control  by  the  government  during 
World  War  II,  investors  often  abandoned  the  vecindad  market, 
depleting  an  already  poor  housing  stock. 

Government  efforts  to  address  the  urban  housing  shortfall 
after  World  War  II  generally  proved  inadequate.  During  the 
1950s  and  1960s,  the  government  financed  some  housing  units 
in  major  metropolitan  areas,  the  largest  of  which — the 
Nonoalco-Tlatelolco  housing  complex  in  northern  Mexico 
City — contained  nearly  12,000  units. 

However,  public  employees  were  the  principal  beneficiaries 
of  government  housing  programs.  During  the  administration 
of  Luis  Echeverna  Alvarez  (1970-76),  the  government  took  a 
more  active  role  in  fostering  formal-  and  informal-sector  hous- 
ing. Three  funds  were  established  in  1972:  the  Institute  of  the 
National  Housing  Fund  for  Workers  (Instituto  del  Fondo 
Nacional  de  la  Vivienda  para  los  Trabajadores — Infonavit);  the 
Housing  Fund  of  the  Institute  of  Social  Security  and  Services 
for  State  Workers  (Fondo  para  la  Vivienda  del  Instituto  de  Ser- 
vicios  y  Seguridad  Social  de  los  Trabajadores  del  Estado — 
Fovissste);  and  the  National  Institute  for  Community  Develop- 
ment (Instituto  Nacional  para  el  Desarrollo  de  la  Comu- 
nidad — Indeco).  These  funds  were  designed  to  meet  the  needs 
of  private-sector  formal  workers,  state  employees,  and  infor- 
mal-sector workers,  respectively.  Of  the  three  funds,  Infonavit 
was  the  most  extensive,  with  nearly  900,000  units  financed  over 
a  twenty-year  period.  Still,  demand  far  exceeded  supply  and  a 
lottery  system  was  used  to  determine  occupancy.  In  addition, 
most  workers  could  not  afford  the  monthly  payments  required. 

For  the  majority  of  the  urban  lower  class,  so-called  self-help 
housing  has  emerged  as  the  only  viable  option.  A  self-help 
housing  community  typically  begins  with  the  purchase  by  inves- 
tors of  large  tracts  of  contiguous  land  on  the  periphery  of 
urban  areas.  In  some  cases,  these  transactions  involve  illegal 
purchases  of  ejido  properties  of  dubious  agricultural  worth. 
Whether  ejido  or  not,  however,  the  tracts  usually  consist  of  mar- 
ginal lands  ill-suited  for  middle-  and  upper-class  residential 
developments  or  for  industrial  purposes.  Investors  subdivide 


109 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


the  land  into  numerous  lots  and  sell  them  to  low-income  fami- 
lies, who  then  build  modest  brick  structures,  often  with  only 
single  large  rooms.  Ostensibly,  investors  cannot  sell  lots  until 
they  have  installed  water  and  sewer  lines,  paved  streets,  and 
completed  other  basic  infrastructure.  Frequently,  however, 
investors  do  little  more  than  mark  the  lots  for  sale.  Because  a 
large  land  tract  may  contain  thousands  of  potential  lots,  inves- 
tors often  realize  enormous  profits. 

Nezahualcoyotl,  Mexico's  quintessential  self-help  housing 
community,  burst  onto  the  national  scene  during  the  1960s. 
During  the  late  1950s,  a  group  of  investors  purchased  more 
than  sixty  square  kilometers  of  land  east  of  Mexico  City  in  an 
area  in  the  state  of  Mexico  just  outside  the  Federal  District.  The 
land  in  question,  a  dried  lakebed,  flooded  during  the  rainy  sea- 
son and  was  prone  to  dust  storms  during  the  dry  season.  None- 
theless, investors  created  160,000  low-income  housing  lots.  By 
1970  Nezahualcoyotl  contained  nearly  700,000  residents,  but 
there  were  few  public  services. 

Local  governments  have  varied  widely  in  the  degree  of  sup- 
port extended  to  self-help  housing  developments.  Although 
the  Federal  District  blocked  most  self-help  housing  after  the 
early  1950s,  the  neighboring  state  of  Mexico  actively  encour- 
aged the  development  of  communities  such  as  Nezahualcoyotl, 
in  effect  serving  as  a  safety  valve  for  Mexico  City.  Likewise, 
Guadalajara  generally  has  endorsed  such  development  as  an 
appropriate  response  to  the  housing  needs  of  the  urban  poor. 
By  contrast,  Monterrey  and  a  number  of  other  cities  in  north- 
ern Mexico  have  opposed  self-help  communities,  a  decision 
that  has  sparked  frequent  squatter  invasions  of  ejido  land.  Local 
authorities  sometimes  have  used  force  to  dislodge  the  invaders, 
but  often  have  tacitly  allowed  the  new  communities  to  remain. 

Despite  obvious  problems,  self-help  housing  has  addressed 
numerous  important  and  cross-cutting  social  issues.  These 
communities  substantially  increase  the  housing  stock  available 
to  low-income  urban  residents.  As  sociologists  Alan  Gilbert  and 
Peter  Ward  have  observed,  without  self-help  construction,  the 
government  either  would  have  to  expend  many  more  resources 
on  housing  projects  or  raise  wages  to  enable  the  poor  to  com- 
pete in  the  formal  housing  market.  By  forcing  people  to  build 
their  own  homes,  the  government  has  been  able  to  preserve 
funds  to  underwrite  industrial  development.  Self-help  housing 
also  allows  lower-income  residents  to  become  owners  rather 
than  renters.  And  as  self-help  communities  mature  and  resi-

dents  add  to  initial  structures,  renters  (typically  poorer, 
younger,  and  more  recently  arrived  in  the  city  than  owners) 
have  housing  options  other  than  vecindades. 

Even  including  self-help  construction,  however,  Mexico 
faced  a  severe  housing  crisis  in  the  mid-1990s.  The  Zedillo 
administration  reported  in  1995  that  more  than  25  percent  of 
the  17.8  million  houses  needed  to  be  repaired  or  replaced. 
Because  two-thirds  of  the  population  are  under  thirty  years  of 
age,  analysts  project  sharp  increases  in  demand  for  new  hous- 
ing over  the  next  two  decades. 

Rural  Society 

Nearly  eighty  years  after  enactment,  agrarian  reform 
remains  at  once  one  of  the  Mexican  Revolution's  most  impres- 
sive accomplishments  and  enduring  failures.  At  the  onset  of 
the  revolution,  huge  haciendas  controlled  almost  all  agricul- 
tural land.  By  1991  agrarian  reform  beneficiaries  (and  their 
heirs)  held  about  half  of  all  national  land.  More  than  3.5  mil- 
lion campesinos  live  and  work  in  nearly  30,000  communities 
formed  as  a  direct  result  of  various  agrarian  reform  initiatives. 
At  the  same  time,  however,  most  campesinos  hold  marginal  par- 
celas  (individual  plots)  that  cannot  meet  the  subsistence  needs 
of  their  families.  These  campesinos,  as  well  as  those  with  no 
land  at  all,  have  to  work  periodically  for  large  landowners  or 
agribusinesses,  migrate  seasonally  to  the  United  States,  or  take 
a  variety  of  other  actions  to  survive. 

The  Agrarian  Reform  Act  of  1915  and  the  constitution  of 
1917  laid  the  groundwork  for  dramatic  changes  in  Mexico's 
land  tenure  system.  These  documents  established  that  the 
nation  retained  ultimate  control  over  privately  held  land, 
which  could  be  expropriated  and  redistributed  in  the  public 
interest  to  campesinos. 

The  ejido,  or  communally  farmed  plot,  emerged  as  the 
uniquely  Mexican  form  of  redistributing  large  landholdings. 
Under  this  arrangement,  a  group  of  villagers  could  petition  the 
government  to  seize  private  properties  that  exceeded  certain 
specified  sizes — initially  150  hectares  for  irrigated  land  and  200 
hectares  for  rain-fed  holdings.  Assuming  a  favorable  review  of 
the  petition,  the  government  then  expropriated  the  property 
and  created  an  ejido.  The  state  retained  title  to  the  land  but 
granted  the  villagers,  now  known  as  ejidatarios,  the  right  to  farm 
the  land,  either  in  a  collective  manner  or  through  the  designa- 
tion of  individual  parcelas.  Ejidatarios  could  not  sell  or  mortgage 


112 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


their  land  but  could  pass  usufruct  rights  to  their  heirs.  Ejidata- 
rios  had  to  work  their  land  regularly  in  order  to  maintain  rights 
over  it.  In  cases  where  villagers  established  that  they  had  collec- 
tively farmed  the  land  in  question  before  its  eventual  consolida- 
tion into  a  hacienda,  the  government  created  an  agrarian 
community  (comunidad  agraria).  Comuneros  (members  of  agrar- 
ian communities),  who  lived  primarily  in  southern  Mexico,  had 
largely  the  same  rights  and  responsibilities  as  ejidatarios. 

Mexican  administrations  have  varied  widely  in  the  impor- 
tance accorded  to  the  ejido.  During  the  1920s  and  early  1930s, 
policy  makers  typically  viewed  the  ejido  as  a  transitional  system 
that  would  lead  to  small  private  farms  nationwide.  For  exam- 
ple, President  Plutarco  Elias  Calles  (1924-28)  described  the 
ejido  as  a  school  from  which  ejidatarios  eventually  would  gradu- 
ate as  private  farmers.  Given  this  perspective,  policy  makers 
encouraged  ejidos  to  divide  their  lands  into  individual  parcelas. 
In  contrast,  President  Lazaro  Cardenas  (1934-40)  saw  the  ejido 
as  an  essential  and  permanent  component  of  agricultural 
development,  and  he  encouraged  a  collectivist  organizational 
structure  to  maximize  resources.  During  his  six-year  term, 
Cardenas  expropriated  nearly  18  million  hectares  of  privately 
owned  land  for  redistribution  as  ejidos,  more  than  double  the 
total  amount  recorded  since  the  revolution  ended.  The  ejido 
share  of  total  cultivable  land  increased  from  roughly  13  per- 
cent in  1930  to  approximately  47  percent  in  1940. 

During  the  next  three  decades,  the  government  favored 
large-scale  commercial  agriculture  at  the  expense  of  the  ejido. 
Federally  funded  irrigation  projects  in  the  states  of  Sonora  and 
Sinaloa  and  in  the  agriculturally  important  Bajio  region  of 
Guanajuato  and  northern  Michoacan  were  designed  to  enable 
large  landowners  to  compete  in  the  United  States  agricultural 
market.  The  government  also  narrowed  the  definition  of  pri- 
vate properties  eligible  for  expropriation. 

Upon  assuming  the  presidency  in  1970,  Luis  Echeverria 
Alvarez  shifted  government  priorities  back  to  the  ejido.  Espous- 
ing the  same  philosophy  as  Cardenas  three  decades  before, 
Echeverria  felt  that  the  ejido  would  play  a  leading  role  in  meet- 
ing domestic  food  demand.  Echeverria  increased  ejido  holdings 
by  some  17  million  hectares,  including  the  expropriation  of 
rich  irrigated  lands  in  Sonora.  Collectivized  ejidos  received  pref- 
erential access  to  credit  and  farm  equipment  through  govern- 
ment agencies  such  as  the  National  Bank  of  Rural  Credit 
(Banco  Nacional  de  Credito  Rural — Banrural). 


113 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

The  Echeverria  administration  marked  the  last  significant 
redistribution  of  landholdings.  Echeverria's  successor,  Lopez 
Portillo,  distributed  only  about  1.8  million  hectares  to  ejidos. 
Yet  like  Echeverria,  Lopez  Portillo  sought  to  channel  govern- 
ment resources  to  ejidos.  Following  the  discovery  of  vast  petro- 
leum reserves  along  Mexico's  southeastern  coast,  Lopez 
Portillo  used  oil  profits  to  establish  the  Mexican  Food  System 
(Sistema  Alimentario  Mexicano — SAM),  which  sought  to 
ensure  national  self-sufficiency  in  basic  staples,  such  as  corn 
and  beans.  Lopez  Portillo  encouraged  ejidos  to  play  a  major 
role  in  this  effort  and  channeled  petrodollars  to  agencies  offer- 
ing credit  to  ejidatarios.  For  many  ejidatarios,  however,  credit 
merely  generated  increased  debt  and  dependence  on  govern- 
ment bureaucracies  without  significantly  improving  their  over- 
all conditions.  In  the  wake  of  the  debt  crisis  that  began  in  1982, 
the  administration  of  Miguel  de  la  Madrid  Hurtado  (1982-88) 
abolished  the  SAM  and  cut  agricultural  funding  by  two-thirds. 

Despite  collectivist  efforts  of  Echeverria  and,  to  a  much 
lesser  extent,  Lopez  Portillo,  a  national  survey  released  at  the 
beginning  of  the  Salinas  presidency  revealed  that  approxi- 
mately 88  percent  of  ejidatarios  and  comuneros  farmed  individual 
parcelas.  (Government  statistics  did  not  differentiate  between 
ejidos  and  agrarian  communities.)  The  survey  also  indicated  a 
notable  differentiation  between  the  16  percent  of  ejidos  and 
agrarian  communities  that  had  irrigated  fields  and  the  remain- 
der that  did  not.  The  former  reported  significantly  higher  per- 
centages in  the  use  of  improved  seeds,  pesticides,  and 
fertilizers,  as  well  as  access  to  technical  assistance.  Sixty-five  per- 
cent of  all  ejidatarios  and  comuneros  indicated  that  they  grew 
corn  as  their  principal  crop. 

Mexico's  post-1940  population  explosion  produced  a  contin- 
ual subdivision  of  most  parcelas,  resulting  in  holdings  that  were 
below  subsistence  level.  According  to  the  1981  agricultural  cen- 
sus, nearly  31  percent  of  all  ejidatarios  held  parcelas  of  two  hec- 
tares or  less,  far  below  the  amount  of  land  required  to  support 
a  family.  Another  27  percent  maintained  holdings  ranging 
from  two  to  five  hectares,  with  38  percent  farming  parcelas  of 
between  five  and  twenty  hectares.  Less  than  3  percent  of  ejidata- 
rios held  individual  plots  of  between  twenty  and  fifty  hectares. 

Data  from  the  1981  agricultural  census  on  private  landhold- 
ing  patterns  revealed  an  even  more  stratified  picture.  Nearly  40 
percent  of  all  private  (non-ejido)  farmers  held  plots  of  two  hec- 
tares or  less,  with  an  additional  17  percent  working  plots  of 


114 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


between  two  and  five  hectares.  Together,  these  two  groups  had 
only  2  percent  of  the  privately  owned  land  area.  In  contrast,  2 
percent  of  all  landholders  controlled  nearly  63  percent  of  the 
privately  owned  land.  Holdings  exceeding  2,500  hectares  were 
particularly  in  evidence  in  the  north  (especially  in  Chihuahua 
and  Sonora)  and  in  Chiapas. 

With  plots  too  small  to  support  even  a  modest  standard  of 
living,  farming  has  become  a  secondary  source  of  income  for 
most  campesinos.  Many  worked  as  day  laborers  for  large  land- 
holders. The  1981  agricultural  census  recorded  approximately 
3  million  farm  laborers,  60  percent  of  them  temporary.  Ejida- 
tarios,  in  effect,  form  a  cheap  and  available  labor  pool  for  com- 
mercial agriculture.  These  sectors  are  further  linked  through 
the  illegal  before  1992  but  nevertheless  widespread  practice  of 
renting  ejido  land.  Although  the  government  maintains  no  sta- 
tistics on  this  activity,  some  observers  estimate  that  up  to  half  of 
the  irrigated  ejido  lands  in  Sonora  and  Sinaloa  and  up  to  half  of 
such  holdings  in  the  Bajio  region  of  Guanajuato  and  southern 
Michoacan  are  rented.  Regular  migration  to  the  United  States 
also  is  an  essential  survival  strategy  for  many  campesinos,  with 
remittances  allowing  many  families  to  remain  in  the  country- 
side. Many  young  campesinos  spend  the  bulk  of  the  year  work- 
ing in  the  United  States,  returning  to  their  plots  only  during 
the  planting  and  harvesting  seasons.  An  unknown  number  of 
campesinos  in  isolated  communities  in  southern  and  western 
Mexico  also  engage  in  narcotics  trafficking. 

In  the  1970s,  sociologist  Rodolfo  Stavenhagen  and  other 
scholars  suggested  that  the  ejidatarios  were  among  Mexico's 
poorest  and  most  exploited  rural  workers.  Their  productivity 
was  low  because  of  the  poor  quality  of  their  land,  the  lack  of 
timely  technical  assistance,  and  the  unavailability  of  low-cost 
agricultural  inputs.  Yet  the  government's  official  policy  histori- 
cally has  been  to  keep  agricultural  prices  low  in  an  effort  to 
subsidize  the  urban  population. 

Ejidatarios  remain  highly  dependent  on  the  bureaucratic 
channels  of  both  the  state  and  the  ruling  PRI).  All  ejidatarios 
are  automatically  members  of  the  peasant  sector  of  the  PRI; 
but  owing  to  their  lack  of  political  experience,  they  become 
easily  manipulated  by  professional  "peasant"  leaders  in  Mexico 
City,  who  are  usually  of  middle-class  backgrounds.  Many  ejida- 
tarios look  to  the  state  as  a  modern  patron  (traditional  paternal- 
istic landlord)  who  has  the  power  to  control  prices,  credit 
opportunities,  and  access  to  farm  machinery  and  water  rights 


115

and  who  must  be  continuously  courted  and  reminded  of  their 
pressing  needs. 

Confronted  with  the  dysfunctional  character  of  much  of 
Mexican  agriculture,  the  government  in  1992  radically 
changed  the  ejido  land  tenure  system,  codifying  some  existing 
actions  that  were  illegal  but  widely  practiced  and  introducing 
several  new  features.  Under  the  new  law,  an  ejido  can  award  its 
members  individual  titles  to  the  land,  not  merely  usufruct 
rights  to  their  parcelas.  Ejidatarios  can,  in  turn,  choose  to  rent, 
sell,  or  mortgage  their  properties.  Ejidatarios  do  not  need  to 
work  their  lands  to  maintain  ownership  over  them.  They  also 
may  enter  into  partnerships  with  private  entrepreneurs.  The 
law  also  effectively  ends  the  redistribution  of  land  through  gov- 
ernment decree.  Finally,  the  processing  and  resolution  of  land 
disputes  are  decentralized. 

The  government's  perspective  is  that  these  new  measures 
provide  ejidatarios  with  more  realistic  and  sensible  options.  A 
winnowing  effect  is  anticipated,  as  some  inefficient  and  mar- 
ginal producers  sell  their  properties  to  more  efficient  farmers. 
With  property  to  mortgage,  the  more  entrepreneurial  ejidata- 
rios have  collateral  that  can  be  used  to  obtain  private-sector 
credit.  By  removing  the  prospect  of  widespread  government- 
directed  land  redistribution,  owners  will  be  more  likely  to 
invest  resources  to  increase  agricultural  production.  Govern- 
ment critics  fear,  however,  that  the  revisions  will  increase  land- 
lessness  and  poverty  among  ejidatarios  and  solidify  inequitable 
patterns  of  land  distribution  in  states  such  as  Chiapas. 

As  part  of  its  overall  agricultural  program,  the  Salinas  admin- 
istration attempted  to  restructure  Banrural  as  a  more  efficient 
and  streamlined  organization,  limiting  its  scope  to  serving 
those  ejidatarios  with  production  capabilities.  To  assist  more 
marginal  producers  in  dealing  with  the  agricultural  transfor- 
mation, Salinas  established  the  Procampo  program  in  1993  as 
part  of  the  Pronasol  initiative.  Procampo  provided  direct  pay- 
ments to  farmers  based  on  the  size  of  their  holdings.  In  1995 
President  Zedillo  shifted  Procampo's  operation  to  the  newly 
created  Alliance  for  the  Countryside  (Alianza  para  el  Campo) 
and  extended  it  for  a  fifteen-year  period. 

Interpersonal  Relations 

Interpersonal  relations  are  more  important  in  the  function- 
ing of  Mexican  society  than  impersonal,  bureaucratic  norms 
and  regulations.  Parentela  (extended  family)  members,  compa- 


116 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


dres  (godparents),  cuates  (very  close  buddies),  and  friends 
expect  from  one  another  various  degrees  of  loyalty,  material 
and  spiritual  assistance,  emotional  support,  physical  protec- 
tion, and  even  flexibility  in  the  enforcement  of  laws,  norms, 
and  regulations. 

Primary  ties  are  structured  through  blood  descent,  which  is 
traced  equally  through  the  father's  and  mother's  side.  Every 
person  is,  therefore,  a  member  of  two  family  lines.  The  per- 
son's name,  which  often  includes  the  matrilineal  after  the  patri- 
lineal, represents  this  arrangement. 

One's  parentela  usually  includes  all  the  descendants  of  a 
great-grandparent  or  of  a  grandparent  on  both  the  father's  and 
the  mother's  sides.  Thus,  it  is  fairly  common  for  a  person  to 
claim  having  a  dozen  or  more  "uncles"  and  "aunts"  and  several 
dozen  cousins.  However,  this  same  person  can  easily  identify 
the  several  degrees  of  the  specific  type  of  relationships  that 
exist  within  the  family. 

The  Mexican  household — that  is,  those  family  members  who 
dwell  under  the  same  roof — differs  from  the  North  American 
household.  Mexican  households  can  include  the  parents' 
nuclear  family  as  well  as  that  of  a  married  son  or  daughter  and 
their  young  children.  Living  arrangements  vary  among  the  dif- 
ferent kinds  of  households.  In  most  cases  in  which  two  or  more 
nuclear  families  share  the  same  roof,  each  nuclear  family  keeps 
its  separate  budget  and,  often,  a  separate  kitchen.  After  a  few 
years  of  living  with  their  parents,  married  children  who  opt  for 
this  arrangement  often  set  up  independent  households.  Other 
household  members  can  include  out-of-town  relatives,  fellow 
townsmen,  and  arrimados  (literally  "the  leaned-on,"  that  is,  rent- 
ers or  "permanent  guests"). 

Family  membership  presupposes  an  inalienable  bond 
among  first-,  second-,  third-,  and  fourth-generation  relatives,  a 
bond  that  is  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  set  of  rights  and 
obligations.  Family  members  are  expected  to  display  affection 
openly  and  reciprocally,  as  well  as  provide  each  other  material 
and  moral  support.  The  traditional  family  has  the  power  to 
enforce  these  virtues  through  the  exercise  of  pressure  over  its 
members  and  through  a  series  of  actions  usually  performed  by 
its  elder  members.  These  include  social  pressure,  manipula- 
tion, and  gossip. 

Despite  the  dramatic  changes  that  have  occurred  in  Mexican 
society  since  1940,  the  family  remains  the  most  important 
social  institution.  Indeed,  the  economic  crisis  of  the  1980s  may 


117

have  enhanced  its  role  as  the  place  to  turn  when  in  need.  A 
national  opinion  poll  conducted  in  1982  by  the  Center  for 
Educational  Studies  confirmed  the  centrality  of  the  Mexican 
family.  The  majority  of  those  surveyed  identified  the  family  as 
the  institution  where  they  felt  most  secure  and  confident.  Most 
viewed  the  family  as  the  essential  safety  net  providing  help  and 
protection.  Economic  survival  often  requires  several  family 
members  to  enter  the  workforce  and  pool  their  incomes.  As 
noted  previously,  remittances  from  one  or  more  children  work- 
ing in  the  United  States  allow  many  families  to  continue  living 
in  rural  areas. 

The  critical  role  of  the  Mexican  family  was  also  confirmed  in 
a  1995  national  survey  sponsored  by  the  Institute  of  Social 
Research  of  the  National  Autonomous  University  of  Mexico 
(Universidad  Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico — UNAM). 
Respondents  associated  the  family  with  such  positive  terms  as 
love,  household,  children,  and  well-being.  Respondents  also 
identified  rejection  by  one's  family  as  a  worse  occurrence  than 
injustice  and  abuse  of  authority,  poverty,  and  work  conflicts. 

Although  Mexicans  generally  hold  their  families  in  high 
esteem,  such  may  not  be  the  case  with  those  outside  the  family 
web.  Eighty  percent  of  those  interviewed  by  the  Center  for 
Educational  Studies  agreed  that  one  should  be  cautious  in  rela- 
tions outside  the  family.  The  center's  analysts  linked  this  low 
level  of  confidence  and  trust  with  a  distinction  most  Mexicans 
made  between  their  own  moral  codes  and  those  of  others.  In 
general,  Mexicans  feel  that  they  adhere  to  a  much  higher 
moral  standard  than  do  their  neighbors.  Thus,  for  example,  80 
percent  of  those  interviewed  believed  it  important  to  honor 
one's  parents.  However,  when  asked  if  others  felt  the  same  way, 
only  three  out  of  ten  agreed.  As  a  result  of  the  focus  on  one's 
family  for  trust  and  help,  fewer  than  half  of  those  surveyed 
reported  membership  in  civic  or  social  organizations. 

Attitudes  towards  non-family  members  may  be  evolving,  how- 
ever, as  Mexicans  increasingly  endorse  the  tenets  of  a  modern 
and  open  society.  The  UNAM  researchers  found  considerable 
evidence  that  Mexicans  had  become  tolerant  of  others  and  sup- 
portive of  cultural  differences.  Such  attitudes  are  particularly 
prevalent  among  Mexican  youth  and  those  with  higher  educa- 
tional and  income  levels. 

For  many  families,  however,  compadrazgo,  or  the  system  of 
godparenting,  offers  a  way  to  expand  their  support  structure.  A 
family  initiates  this  ritual  kinship  network  by  inviting  a  man

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

and  woman  to  serve  as  godparents  for  a  child.  Through  com- 
padrazgo,  the  child's  parents  and  godparents — now  known  as 
compadres  (literally  "co-fathers")  and  comadres  ("co-mothers") — 
enter  into  a  complex  relationship  of  rights  and  obligations. 
Often,  the  relationship  cuts  across  social  classes.  When  in  need, 
a  family  often  turns  to  its  children's  godparents  for  assistance. 
For  instance,  an  employer  is  expected  to  look  first  to  his  or  her 
children's  godparents  when  hiring  additional  workers.  In 
exchange,  the  compadrazgo  demands  intense  loyalty  to  the 
employer  from  the  worker  hired  by  that  means. 

"Permanent"  social  relations  also  are  built  through  cuatismo 
among  men  and  comparable  associations  of  women.  Cuate 
(from  the  Nahuatl  word  meaning  twin  brother)  is  used 
throughout  Mexico  to  describe  a  special  male  friend  or  group 
of  friends  with  whom  one  spends  considerable  leisure  time  and 
who  can  be  trusted  with  intimate  information.  Cuate  groups 
can  include  up  to  ten  members  who  share  common  interests, 
who  are  bound  by  intense  friendship  and  personal  relations, 
and  who  commit  themselves  to  assisting  each  other  in  case  of 
need. 

Role  of  Women 

Beginning  in  the  1970s  and  over  the  next  two  decades,  dra- 
matic changes  occurred  in  the  role  of  women  in  the  Mexican 
economy.  In  1990  women  represented  31  percent  of  the  eco- 
nomically active  population,  double  the  percentage  recorded 
twenty  years  earlier.  The  demographics  of  women  in  the  work- 
force also  changed  during  this  period.  In  1980  the  typical 
female  worker  was  under  twenty-five  years  of  age.  Her  partici- 
pation in  the  workforce  was  usually  transitional  and  would  end 
following  marriage  or  childbirth.  After  the  1970s,  however,  an 
emerging  feminist  movement  made  it  more  acceptable  for  edu- 
cated Mexican  women  to  pursue  careers.  In  addition,  the  eco- 
nomic crisis  of  the  1980s  required  many  married  women  to 
return  to  the  job  market  to  help  supplement  their  husbands' 
income.  About  70  percent  of  women  workers  in  the  mid-1990s 
were  employed  in  the  tertiary  sector  of  the  economy,  usually  at 
wages  below  those  of  men. 

The  growing  presence  of  women  in  the  workforce  contrib- 
uted to  some  changes  in  social  attitudes,  despite  the  prevalence 
of  other  more  traditional  attitudes.  The  UNAM  1995  national 
opinion  survey,  for  example,  found  a  growing  acceptance  that 
men  and  women  should  share  in  family  responsibilities. 


120 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Approximately  half  of  all  respondents  agreed  that  husbands 
and  wives  should  jointly  handle  child-care  duties  and  perform 
housekeeping  chores.  However,  such  views  were  strongly 
related  to  income  and  educational  level.  Low  income  and  min- 
imally educated  respondents  regarded  household  tasks  as 
women's  work.  The  UNAM  responses  correlated  with  the  find- 
ings of  Mercedes  Gonzalez  de  la  Rocha,  whose  research 
focused  on  working-class  households  in  Guadalajara.  Gonzalez 
de  la  Rocha  reported  that  the  members  of  these  households 
held  traditional  norms  and  values  regarding  the  roles  of  men 
and  women.  In  addition,  these  women  were  often  subjected  to 
control,  domination,  and  violence  by  men. 

Observers  noted  that  women  generally  were  held  to  a 
stricter  sexual  code  of  conduct  than  men.  Sexual  activity  out- 
side of  marriage  was  regarded  as  immoral  for  "decent"  women 
but  acceptable  for  men. 

Religion 

The  1980s  and  early  1990s  witnessed  a  notable  shift  in  reli- 
gious affiliation  and  in  church-state  relations  in  Mexico. 
Although  Mexico  remains  predominantly  Roman  Catholic, 
evangelical  churches  have  dramatically  expanded  their  mem- 
bership. Motivated  in  part  by  the  evangelical  challenge,  the 
leadership  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  has  sought  greater 
visibility,  speaking  out  on  sensitive  public  issues  and  ignoring 
constitutional  bans  on  clerical  involvement  in  politics.  These 
actions  ultimately  led  in  1992  to  dramatic  constitutional 
changes  and  a  resumption  of  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Vat- 
ican. 

The  Roman  Catholic  share  of  the  population  declined 
steadily  during  the  period  from  1970  to  1990.  In  1970,  96.2  per- 
cent of  the  population  five  years  of  age  and  older  identified 
itself  as  Roman  Catholic.  That  dropped  to  92.6  percent  of  the 
population  in  the  1980  census  and  to  89.7  percent  in  1990.  The 
1990  census  revealed  significant  regional  variations  in  numbers 
of  Roman  Catholics.  Roman  Catholics  represented  more  than 
95  percent  of  all  Mexicans  in  a  band  of  central-western  states 
extending  from  Zacatecas  to  Michoacan.  In  contrast,  the  least 
Roman  Catholic  presence  was  found  in  the  southeastern  states 
of  Chiapas,  Campeche,  Tabasco,  and  Quintana  Roo. 

Dozens  of  evangelical  denominations  have  engaged  in 
strong  recruitment  efforts  since  1970.  Protestant  or  "evangeli- 
cal" affiliation — the  terminology  used  by  Mexican  census  offi- 


121

cials — surged  from  1.8  percent  in  1970  to  3.3  percent  in  1980 
and  to  4.9  percent  in  1990.  Traditional  Protestant  denomina- 
tions, including  Lutherans,  Methodists,  and  Presbyterians, 
have  had  a  small  urban  presence  dating  from  the  late  1800s. 
However,  the  Protestant  membership  explosion  during  the 
1970-90  period  was  led  by  congregations  affiliated  with 
churches  such  as  the  Assemblies  of  God,  the  Seventh  Day 
Adventists,  the  Church  of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter  Day  Saints 
(Mor  mons),  and  Jehovah's  Witnesses.  For  example,  the  Mor- 
mons reported  that  membership  surged  from  248,000  in  1980 
to  617,000  in  1990  and  increased  further  to  688,000  by  1993. 

Protestant  or  evangelical  growth  was  especially  strong  in 
southeastern  Mexico.  In  1990  Protestants  or  evangelicals  com- 
posed 16  percent  of  the  population  in  Chiapas,  15  percent  in 
Tabasco,  14  percent  in  Campeche,  and  12  percent  in  Quintana 
Roo.  Yet  a  significant  evangelical  presence  also  has  appeared  in 
several  other  areas,  including  the  states  of  Veracruz  and 
Mexico,  where  more  than  20  percent  of  all  Protestants  or  evan- 
gelicals live. 

Church-State  Relations 

The  Roman  Catholic  Church's  role  in  Mexican  history  goes 
back  to  1519.  When  Hernan  Cortes,  the  Spanish  conqueror  of 
New  Spain,  landed  on  the  coast  of  Mexico,  he  was  accompa- 
nied by  Roman  Catholic  clergy.  All  new  Spanish  territories 
were  to  be  conquered  in  the  name  of  the  cross  as  well  as  the 
crown.  Since  those  early  days,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  has 
always  been  present,  playing  different  roles,  some  of  which 
have  led  to  violent  confrontations. 

The  history  of  the  relationship  between  church  and  state  fol- 
lowing independence  involves  a  series  of  efforts  on  the  part  of 
the  government  to  curtail  the  church's  influence.  Nineteenth- 
century  liberals,  trained  in  the  law  and  influenced  by  the 
French  Revolution,  were  anticlerical.  Liberals,  who  also  were 
federalist  and  favored  free  competition,  were  highly  concerned 
that  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  by  owning  between  one-quar- 
ter and  one-half  of  the  land  and  by  controlling  most  schools, 
hospitals,  and  charitable  institutions,  was  practically  a  state 
within  the  Mexican  state. 

Between  1833  and  the  early  1840s,  the  Mexican  government 
produced  various  pieces  of  legislation  to  limit  the  power  of  the 
church.  In  1833  the  government  adopted  several  anticlerical 
measures,  including  one  providing  for  the  secularization  of

education  and  another  declaring  that  the  payment  of  the  eccle- 
siastical tithe  was  not  a  civil  obligation. 

The  first  major  confrontation  between  the  church  and  the 
state  occurred  during  the  presidency  of  Benito  Juarez  (1855- 
72).  The  1855  Juarez  Law  drastically  reduced  traditional  eccle- 
siastical privileges.  On  March  11,  1857,  a  new  constitution  was 
adopted  that  denied  all  ecclesiastical  entities  the  right  to  own 
real  estate  and  abolished  most  remaining  ecclesiastical  privi- 
leges. On  July  12,  1857,  Juarez  confiscated  all  church  proper- 
ties, suppressed  all  religious  orders,  and  empowered  the  state 
governors  to  designate  what  buildings  could  be  used  for  reli- 
gious services.  Mexico's  first  religious  civil  war  was  fought 
between  1857  and  1860  in  reaction  to  the  legislation  (see  Civil 
War  and  the  French  Intervention,  ch.  1). 

The  constitution  of  1917  highlighted  and  institutionalized 
many  of  the  nineteenth-century  secular  reforms.  The  new  con- 
stitution included  at  least  five  articles  that  affected  all  religious 
groups,  regardless  of  denomination.  These  articles,  which 
remained  in  effect  until  1992,  appeared  to  preclude  any 
national  role  for  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  Article  3  forbade 
churches  from  participating  in  primary  and  secondary  educa- 


123 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


tion.  Article  5  prohibited  the  establishment  of  religious  orders. 
Article  24  mandated  that  all  religious  ceremonies  occur  within 
church  buildings.  Article  27  gave  the  state  ownership  of  all 
church  buildings. 

Article  130  contained  the  most  extensive  restrictions  on  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church.  The  article  stated  that  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church  lacks  legal  status;  ecclesiastical  marriages  have 
no  legal  standing;  state  legislatures  can  determine  the  maxi- 
mum number  of  clergy  operating  within  their  boundaries;  and 
operation  of  church  buildings  requires  explicit  government 
authorization.  Among  the  most  contentious  provisions  of  Arti- 
cle 130  was  Section  9:  "Neither  in  public  nor  private  assembly, 
nor  in  acts  of  worship  or  religious  propaganda  shall  the  minis- 
ters of  the  religions  ever  have  the  right  to  criticize  the  basic 
laws  of  the  country,  of  the  authorities  in  particular  or  of  the 
government  in  general;  they  shall  have  neither  an  active  nor 
passive  vote,  nor  the  right  to  associate  for  political  purposes." 

Beginning  in  1926  and  continuing  until  the  late  1930s,  vari- 
ous federal  and  state  administrations  strenuously  enforced 
these  constitutional  edicts  and  related  laws.  Their  actions 
paved  the  way  for  the  second  Mexican  religious  war,  the  bloody 
Cristero  Rebellion  of  1926-29  in  western  Mexico  (see  The 
Calles  Presidency,  1924-28,  ch.  1).  During  this  period,  the  gov- 
ernor of  Sonora  ordered  all  churches  closed,  officials  in  the 
state  of  Tabasco  required  priests  to  marry  if  they  were  to  offici- 
ate at  mass,  and  the  Chihuahua  government  allowed  only  one 
priest  to  minister  to  the  entire  statewide  Roman  Catholic  popu- 
lation. 

Church-state  conflict  officially  ended  with  the  administra- 
tion of  Manuel  Avila  Camacho  (1940-46).  With  the  notable 
exception  of  Article  130,  Section  9,  the  government  tacitly 
offered  nonenforcement  of  key  constitutional  provisions  in 
exchange  for  the  Roman  Catholic  Church's  cooperation  in 
achieving  social  peace.  Over  the  next  four  decades,  enforce- 
ment of  Article  130,  Section  9,  served  the  interests  of  both  the 
government  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  The  constitu- 
tional restriction  on  ecclesiastical  political  participation 
enabled  the  state  to  limit  the  activities  of  a  powerful  competi- 
tor. It  also  permitted  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  to  sidestep 
controversial  political  issues  and  to  concentrate  on  rebuilding 
its  ecclesiastical  structure  and  presence  throughout  the  coun- 
try. 


124 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


By  the  early  1980s,  however,  this  unspoken  consensus  sup- 
porting the  legal  status  quo  had  eroded.  The  Roman  Catholic 
Church  regarded  the  constitution's  anticlerical  provisions, 
especially  those  governing  ecclesiastical  political  activity,  as 
anachronistic.  It  demanded  the  right  to  play  a  much  more  visi- 
ble role  in  national  affairs.  At  the  same  time,  the  church 
became  increasingly  outspoken  in  its  criticism  of  government 
corruption.  The  Mexican  bishops'  Global  Pastoral  Plan  for 
1980-1982,  for  example,  contained  a  highly  critical  assessment 
of  the  Mexican  political  system.  According  to  the  Roman  Cath- 
olic hierarchy,  democracy  existed  only  in  theory  in  Mexico. 
The  ruling  PRI  monopolized  power,  producing  apathy  and 
frustration  among  citizens  and  judicial  corruption.  The  princi- 
pal worker  and  peasant  unions  were  subject  to  political  control. 
Peasants  and  Indians  constituted  an  exploited,  marginalized 
mass  barely  living  at  a  subsistence  level  and  subject  to  continual 
repression.  During  the  mid-1980s,  the  bishops  of  Chihuahua 
and  Ciudad  Juarez  assumed  prominent  roles  in  denouncing 
electoral  fraud  in  northern  Mexico.  In  the  south,  the  bishops 
of  San  Cristobal  de  las  Casas  and  Tehuantepec  frequently 
accused  the  government  of  human  rights  violations. 

The  Roman  Catholic  Church  hierarchy  has  emphasized  that 
its  renewed  interest  in  political  affairs  does  not  equate  with 
church  involvement  in  party  activities.  According  to  the  Mexi- 
can episcopate,  priests  should  be  above  all  political  parties  and 
may  not  become  political  leaders.  However,  the  church  hierar- 
chy also  argues  that  priests  have  a  moral  responsibility  to 
denounce  actions  that  violate  Christian  morality. 

The  Salinas  administration's  1991  proposal  to  remove  all 
constitutional  restrictions  on  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  rec- 
ommendations approved  by  the  legislature  the  following  year, 
allowed  for  a  more  realistic  church-state  relationship.  At  the 
same  time,  however,  tensions  remained  in  the  relationship,  par- 
ticularly in  southern  Mexico  in  general  and  in  Chiapas  in  par- 
ticular. Local  government  and  PRI  officials  and  ranchers 
accused  the  Bishop  of  San  Cristobal  de  las  Casas  of  having  sup- 
ported the  rebellion  that  began  in  Chiapas  in  1994,  a  charge 
that  the  bishop  denied.  Federal  soldiers  repeatedly  searched 
diocesan  churches  in  their  pursuit  of  the  rebels.  The  govern- 
ment also  expelled  foreign  clergy  who  were  accused  of  inciting 
violence  and  land  seizures.  In  addition,  the  Vatican  accused  the 
San  Cristobal  prelate  of  theological  and  pastoral  distortions 
and  named  a  coadjutor  (successor)  bishop  for  the  diocese  in 


125 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

the  mid-1990s.  For  their  part,  the  rebels  insisted  that  the 
bishop  continue  to  serve  as  mediator  in  their  negotiations  with 
the  federal  government. 

Popular  Beliefs 

Mexican  Catholicism  is  extremely  varied  in  practice.  It 
ranges  from  those  who  support  traditional  folk  religious  prac- 
tices, usually  in  isolated  rural  communities,  to  those  who 
adhere  to  the  highly  intellectualized  theology  of  liberation, 
and  from  charismatic  renewal  prayer  groups  to  the  conserva- 
tive Opus  Dei  movement.  Lay  groups  with  different  goals,  pur- 
poses, and  political  orientations  are  well  known  and  common 
in  contemporary  Mexico.  The  largest  and  best  known  include 
Mexican  Catholic  Action,  Knights  of  Columbus,  Christian 
Study  Courses,  Christian  Family  Movement,  and  a  wide  range 
of  university  students'  and  workers'  organizations. 

The  Virgin  of  Guadalupe  has  long  been  a  symbol  enshrining 
the  major  aspirations  of  Mexican  society.  According  to  Roman 
Catholic  belief,  in  December  1531,  the  Virgin  Mary  appeared 
on  three  occasions  to  a  Christian  Indian  woodcutter  named 
Juan  Diego  on  the  hill  of  Tepeyac,  six  kilometers  north  of 
Mexico  City's  main  plaza.  She  spoke  to  him  in  the  Nahuatl  lan- 
guage and  identified  herself  by  the  name  of  Guadalupe.  The 
Virgin  commanded  Juan  Diego  to  seek  out  Bishop  Juan  de 
Zumarraga  and  to  inform  him  of  her  desire  to  have  a  church 
built  in  her  honor  on  that  spot.  After  two  unsuccessful  visits  to 
the  bishop's  house,  Juan  Diego  returned  to  Tepeyac  and  was 
ordered  by  the  Virgin  to  pick  up  some  roses,  carry  them  on  his 
cloak,  and  attempt  to  make  a  third  visit  to  the  skeptical  bishop. 
Once  in  the  bishop's  office,  Juan  Diego  unfolded  his  cloak  to 
present  the  roses,  and  an  image  of  a  mestizo  Virgin  had  been 
Tniraculously  imprinted  upon  it.  Bishop  Zumarraga  acknowl- 
edged the  miracle,  and  a  shrine  was  built  on  the  site  of  the 
appearances. 

Today,  two  neighboring  basilicas  of  Our  Lady  of  Guadalupe 
are  at  the  foot  of  Tepeyac  hill.  The  first  basilica,  which  was  ded- 
icated in  1709  but  now  is  closed  to  services,  accommodated 
2,000  worshipers;  the  new  ultramodern  basilica,  inaugurated  in 
October  1976,  accommodates  up  to  20,000  people.  Juan 
Diego's  original  cloak  with  the  mestizo  Virgin  image  imprinted 
on  it  hangs  above  the  altar  of  the  new  basilica. 

According  to  anthropologist  Eric  R.  Wolf,  the  Guadalupe 
symbol  links  family,  politics,  and  religion;  the  colonial  past  and 


126 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  independent  present;  and  the  Indian  and  the  Mexican.  It 
reflects  the  salient  social  relationships  of  Mexican  life  and 
embodies  the  emotions  they  generate.  It  is,  ultimately,  a  way  of 
talking  about  Mexico.  Wolfs  views  are  shared  by  Harvey  L. 
Johnson  of  the  University  of  Houston.  For  him,  worship  of  the 
brown-skinned  Virgin  has  resulted  in  the  reconciliation  of  two 
opposing  worlds,  in  the  fusion  of  two  religions,  two  traditions, 
and  cultures.  Devotion  to  Our  Lady  of  Guadalupe  remains 
strong  even  as  other  aspects  of  Mexican  society  have  changed. 
The  UNAM  national  opinion  poll  found,  for  example,  that 
nine  out  of  ten  Mexicans  continued  to  ask  intercessions  from 
the  Virgin  or  a  saint. 

Education 

Despite  impressive  gains  in  enrollment  levels  over  the  previ- 
ous forty  years,  significant  interrelated  problems  plague  the 
Mexican  education  system  in  the  early  1990s.  Many  primary- 
and  secondary-school-age  students,  especially  in  rural  areas, 
fail  to  complete  their  education  programs.  Instructional  qual- 
ity, as  measured  by  student  test  scores,  remains  low.  Although 
operation  of  all  nonuniversity  education  was  given  to  the  states 
in  1993,  the  system  continues  to  be  overly  centralized  and  sub- 
ject to  bureaucratic  encumbrances.  In  addition,  students  are 
often  poorly  prepared  to  meet  the  challenges  of  a  global  econ- 
omy. 

Approximately  27  million  students  attended  school  at  all  lev- 
els during  the  1995-96  instructional  year,  more  than  an  eight- 
fold increase  from  the  enrollment  total  recorded  in  1950.  The 
length  of  compulsory  education  was  raised  from  six  to  nine 
years  in  1992,  but  in  practice  this  new  law  is  largely  ignored. 
Approximately  54  percent  of  all  students  attend  a  six-year  pri- 
mary-school program  that,  together  with  preschool,  special 
education,  and  secondary  school,  constitute  the  basic  educa- 
tion system.  Children  in  nursery  school  or  kindergarten 
accounted  for  12  percent  of  matriculation  at  all  levels  in  1995- 
96.  As  the  Mexican  population  gradually  aged  during  the 
1980s,  the  primary-school  share  of  matriculation  at  all  levels 
declined  from  70  percent  in  1980  and  was  projected  to  con- 
tinue to  fall  through  the  year  2000  (see  Population,  this  ch.; 
table  4,  Appendix).  Upon  successful  completion  of  primary 
school,  students  enter  a  three-year  secondary-school  program, 
or  vocational-education  program.  Approximately  19  percent  of 
all  students  in  1995-96  were  in  secondary  school.  Those  gradu-

ating  from  secondary  school  can  pursue  mid-level  education, 
either  through  a  three-year  college  preparatory  program — the 
bachillerato — or  advanced  technical  training;  this  encompassed 
10  percent  of  all  students  in  1995-96.  Higher  education  con- 
sists of  four-year  college  and  university  education — the  licencia- 
tura — and  postgraduate  training.  Approximately  5  percent  of 
all  students  in  1995-96  were  in  postsecondary  institutions. 

Higher  education  consists  of  three  types:  universities,  tech- 
nological colleges,  and  teacher-training  institutes.  There  are 
private  and  public  institutions  of  all  three  types,  but  public 
institutions  are  more  numerous  and  usually  larger,  with  over  80 
percent  of  students  attending  public  universities  and  colleges. 
Each  state  has  at  least  one  public  university,  often  having  cam- 
puses in  different  cities.  The  largest  public  university,  the 
National  Autonomous  University  of  Mexico  (Universidad 
Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico — UNAM)  in  Mexico  City,  has 
more  than  100,000  students.  Over  ninety  technological  insti- 
tutes had  about  17  percent  of  the  total  higher  education  popu- 
lation in  1994.  Teacher-training  institutes  are  separate  from 
general  universities  and  generally  offer  a  four-year  curriculum. 
Universities  in  fourteen  states  offer  postgraduate  courses,  and 
in  1991  over  28,000  students  were  enrolled  in  master's  degree 
programs  and  1,250  in  doctoral  studies.  Most  students  pursu- 
ing graduate  work,  however,  do  so  outside  Mexico. 

Students'  access  and  retention  remain  critical  concerns  for 
educators.  The  government  reported  in  1989  that  each  year, 
300,000  children  who  should  be  in  first  grade  do  not  attend. 
An  additional  880,000  students  drop  out  of  primary  school 
annually,  500,000  of  them  in  the  first  three  grades.  Nationally, 
in  1989  only  55  percent  of  students  successfully  completed 
their  primary  education,  and  graduation  rates  were  only  10 
percent  in  many  rural  areas.  However,  the  government 
reported  that  in  1995  the  national  graduation  rate  reached  62 
percent. 

Approximately  15,000  schools — 20  percent  of  the  total — did 
not  offer  all  six  primary  grades  in  1989.  In  that  year,  22  percent 
of  all  primary  schools  had  only  one  teacher.  The  government 
could  meet  only  10  percent  of  potential  demand  for  special 
education.  Thirty  percent  of  all  secondary-school  enrollers 
failed  to  complete  the  three-year  curriculum.  As  a  result,  gov- 
ernment education  officials  estimated  that  20.2  million  Mexi- 
cans had  not  completed  primary  education  and  another  16 
million  had  not  finished  secondary  school.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  disparity  in  educational  opportunity  is  reflected  in 
national  literacy  levels  (see  fig.  7).  According  to  the  1990  cen- 
sus, 86.8  percent  of  all  Mexicans  fifteen  years  of  age  and  older 
indicated  that  they  could  read  and  write.  Two  states  in  north- 
ern Mexico — Baja  California  and  Nuevo  Leon — reported  liter- 
acy rates  exceeding  95  percent,  and  several  other  northern 
states  and  Mexico  City  indicated  levels  between  90  and  95  per- 
cent. In  contrast,  Chiapas,  Guerrero,  and  Oaxaca  had  literacy 
levels  below  75  percent.  National  literacy  rates  improved 
slightly  to  89  percent  by  1995. 

Besides  issues  of  access  and  opportunity,  observers  expressed 
concern  about  the  quality  of  instruction.  Anecdotal  evidence 
compiled  from  student  test  scores  by  one  informed  observer, 
Gilberto  Guevara  Niebla,  pointed  to  low  academic  achieve- 
ment in  numerous  subjects,  including  mathematics,  languages, 
and  geography.  Observers  also  criticized  the  highly  bureau- 
cratic and  centralized  nature  of  Mexico's  education  system, 
which  traditionally  had  been  centralized.  Until  1992  all  pri- 
mary schools,  irrespective  of  regional  distinctions,  followed  a 
uniform  program  of  study.  Fearing  a  potential  loss  of  political 
influence,  the  powerful  National  Union  of  Education  Workers 
(Sindicato  Nacional  de  Trabajadores  de  la  Educacion — SNTE) 
strongly  opposed  efforts  to  decentralize  curriculum  and  pro- 
gram management  and  retrain  teachers.  At  the  same  time, 
however,  the  government  has  earmarked  few  resources  to  eval- 
uate school  system  performance.  The  result,  according  to  edu- 
cators, is  a  system  that  stifles  student  creativity. 

The  deficiencies  in  the  basic  education  system  tend  to  carry 
over  into  public  postsecondary  education.  Observers  have 
identified  numerous  deficiencies,  including  faculty  salaries, 
limited  research  opportunities,  and  inadequate  instructional 
facilities  and  curricula.  As  a  result,  many  employers  increas- 
ingly look  to  private  educational  institutions  to  provide  quali- 
fied professional  staff. 

Responding  to  these  problems,  the  government  established 
in  1992  the  National  Accord  on  the  Modernization  of  Basic 
Education.  Under  the  accord,  the  federal  government  trans- 
ferred responsibility  for  primary  schools'  staff  and  funding  to 
the  states.  The  federal  government,  through  the  Secretariat  of 
Public  Education  (Secretaria  de  Educacion  Publica — SEP), 
retains  authority  to  establish  national  policies  and  to  assist 
schools  in  poor  districts.  In  addition,  a  revamped  curriculum 
places  renewed  emphasis  on  basic  skills,  such  as  reading,  writ- 


129

ing,  and  mathematics.  The  states,  for  their  part,  have  agreed  to 
commit  additional  resources  to  improve  teacher  salaries  and 
training. 

Health  Care  and  Social  Security 

In  the  early  1990s,  Mexico  showed  clear  signs  of  having 
entered  a  transitional  stage  in  the  health  of  its  population. 
When  compared  with  1940  or  even  1970,  Mexico  in  the  1990s 
exhibited  mortality  patterns  that  more  closely  approximated 
those  found  in  developed  societies  (see  table  5,  Appendix). 
Health  officials  have  also  reported  substantial  reductions  in 
morbidity  rates  for  several  diseases  typically  prevalent  in  poorer 
countries. 

At  the  same  time,  however,  government  officials  recognize 
that  this  transition  is,  at  best,  incomplete.  Diseases  associated 
with  unsanitary  living  conditions,  minimal  access  to  health 
care,  or  inadequate  diet  continue  to  affect  those  in  the  lowest 
economic  strata.  Reductions  in  government  health  care  expen- 
ditures during  the  economic  crisis  of  the  1980s  slowed  progress 
in  several  areas.  In  addition,  persistent  underreporting  of  dis- 
eases in  rural  areas  masks  the  true  dimension  of  the  health 
care  challenge. 

Mexico's  social  security  program  provides  health  care  to  for- 
mal-sector workers  and  their  families,  some  50  percent  of  the 
national  population  in  1995.  This  figure  represented  a  drop 
from  the  56  percent  coverage  rate  in  1992.  The  Mexican  Insti- 
tute of  Social  Security  (Instituto  Mexicano  de  Seguro  Social — 
IMSS)  covers  approximately  80  percent  of  these  beneficiaries 
(all  employed  in  the  private  sector).  The  Institute  of  Security 
and  Social  Services  for  State  Workers  (Instituto  de  Seguridad  y 
Servicios  Sociales  para  los  Trabajadores  del  Estado — ISSSTE) 
covers  government  workers  and  accounts  for  17  percent  of  the 
beneficiaries.  The  Secretariat  of  National  Defense  (Secretana 
de  Defensa  Nacional),  the  Secretariat  of  the  Navy  (Secretana 
de  Marina),  and  Mexican  Petroleum  (Petroleos  Mexicanos — 
Pemex)  have  their  own  health  programs,  which  cover  military 
and  naval  personnel,  and  petroleum  workers,  respectively  (see 
Personnel,  ch.  5).  A  tripartite  funding  arrangement  finances 
IMSS  operations,  with  contributions  from  the  employee, 
employer,  and  government.  ISSSTE  programs,  as  well  as  those 
offered  by  the  military  and  Pemex,  are  financed  through 
employee  and  government  contributions.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Those  outside  the  social  security  network — the  so-called 
"open  population" — receive  health  care  from  a  wide  array  of 
government  agencies.  Approximately  one-third  of  the  popula- 
tion is  served  by  IMSS-Solidarity  (IMSS-Solidaridad),  the  suc- 
cessor of  IMSS-Coplamar  (see  Structure  of  Society,  this  ch.) 
IMSS-Solidarity  is  funded  by  general  government  revenues, 
although  IMSS  provides  administrative  direction.  As  part  of 
President  de  la  Madrid's  decentralization  effort  and  corre- 
sponding federal  budget  reduction,  the  population  served  by 
IMSS-Coplamar  in  fourteen  states  was  reassigned  to  state 
health  agencies  under  the  overall  direction  of  the  Secretariat 
of  Health  (Secretaria  de  Salud — SS).  The  SS  also  serves  as 
coordinator  of  the  National  Health  System,  which  includes  the 
health  programs  offered  by  the  social  security  agencies.  In 
keeping  with  its  commitment  to  a  new  federal  partnership,  the 
Zedillo  administration  announced  that  it  would  transfer  facili- 
ties and  operations  of  IMSS-Solidaridad  and  the  SS  to  the  states 
in  1996. 

Social  security  beneficiaries  had  greater  access  to  health  care 
than  did  their  counterparts  among  the  open  population.  In 
1995  the  rates  of  doctors  and  hospital  beds  per  100,000  persons 
stood  at  121  and  ninety,  respectively,  for  social  security  benefi- 
ciaries but  only  105  and  eighty,  respectively,  for  the  open  popu- 
lation. Social  security  beneficiaries  were  also  nearly  twice  as 
likely  as  the  open  population  to  have  consulted  a  doctor  dur- 
ing 1995  and  twice  as  likely  to  have  had  surgery  that  year. 

Notable  regional  disparities  in  health  care  are  also  evident. 
In  1983  the  government  surveyed  health  care  access  nation- 
wide as  measured  by  thirteen  basic  indicators,  including  medi- 
cal facilities,  prenatal  consultation,  medical  attention  to  various 
illnesses,  and  vaccination  programs.  The  Federal  District  and 
three  northern  and  northwestern  states — Coahuila,  Colima, 
and  Nuevo  Leon — recorded  levels  exceeding  eighty  out  of  a 
possible  100  points.  In  contrast,  Oaxaca,  Chiapas,  and  Puebla 
in  southern  and  central  Mexico  averaged  between  forty  and 
fifty  points.  Guerrero  in  the  southwest  posted  a  score  of  only 
thirty-nine. 

Mortality  Patterns 

In  1940  infectious,  parasitic,  and  respiratory  illnesses 
accounted  for  nearly  70  percent  of  all  deaths  in  Mexico.  Three 
decades  later,  these  illnesses  still  produced  more  than  half  of 
all  deaths.  By  1990,  however,  their  share  of  the  overall  mortality 


133 


Figure  7.  Literacy  Level  (Fifteen  Years  of  Age  and  Older)  by  State,  1990 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

level  had  dropped  to  around  20  percent.  Cardiovascular  ill- 
nesses, cancer,  accidents,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  perinatal  com- 
plications emerged  as  the  top  causes  of  death  in  1990,  a  sharp 
change  from  the  previous  pattern.  Yet  despite  the  progress, 
health  officials  recognize  the  continuing  serious  threat  posed 
by  infectious,  parasitic,  and  respiratory  illnesses.  Two  such  ill- 
nesses— pneumonia  and  influenza — and  intestinal  infections 
remained  within  the  top  ten  causes  of  death  in  1990.  Among 
the  twenty  leading  causes  of  death  were  such  maladies  as  nutri- 
tional deficiencies,  chronic  bronchitis,  measles,  tuberculosis, 
anemia,  and  severe  respiratory  infections. 

Government  census  data  record  a  continuous  and  signifi- 
cant decline  in  infant  mortality  from  1930  to  1980  (see  table  6, 
Appendix).  The  infant  mortality  rate  stood  at  145.6  deaths  per 
1,000  registered  live  births  in  1930.  It  dropped  to  96.2  by  1950, 
to  68.5  in  1970,  and  to  40.0  in  1990. 

Wide  regional  variations  in  infant  mortality  levels  persisted 
into  the  1990s.  The  1990  census  indicated,  for  example,  that 
infant  mortality  rates  clustered  around  the  mid-twenties  in  Baja 
California  Norte,  Baja  California  Sur,  the  Federal  District,  and 
Tamaulipas,  and  the  mid-fifties  in  Oaxaca,  Guerrero,  Puebla, 
and  Chiapas  (see  fig.  8).  Even  more  dramatic  variations  could 
be  found  across  municipalities.  In  general,  the  lowest  levels 
appeared  in  highly  urban  municipalities,  especially  state  capi- 
tals and  metropolitan  areas.  In  contrast,  the  highest  rates  typi- 
cally were  associated  with  remote,  rural,  and  largely  Indian 
communities. 

Nationally,  52  percent  of  all  recorded  infant  deaths  in  1990 
occurred  during  the  postneonatal  stage,  when  infants  are  most 
susceptible  to  infections  and  poor  diet.  Although  perinatal 
complications  accounted  for  35  percent  of  all  infant  deaths  in 
1990,  intestinal  infections  and  influenza  and  pneumonia  also 
remained  important  causes,  representing  15  and  13  percent  of 
infant  deaths,  respectively. 

The  government  reported  significant  reductions  between 
1980  and  1990  in  early  childhood  mortality.  Early  childhood 
mortality  declined  from  3.4  per  1,000  preschoolers  in  1980  to 
2.4  in  1990.  Intestinal  infections  headed  the  list  of  causes  of 
death,  followed  by  measles,  pneumonia  and  influenza,  and 
nutritional  deficiencies.  Preliminary  figures  for  1991  suggested 
a  sharp  decline  in  early  childhood  mortality  to  1.6  per  1,000 
preschoolers.  The  1991  figures  pointed  to  notable  statewide 
variations,  with  rates  below  one  in  Coahuila,  Durango,  Sinaloa,

Sonora,  Tamaulipas,  and  the  Federal  District,  and  above  three 
in  Chiapas,  Oaxaca,  and  Puebla. 

Maternal  mortality  also  declined  over  the  same  period,  with 
rates  falling  from  9.4  deaths  per  10,000  registered  live  births  in 
1980  to  5.4  in  1990,  and  to  5.1  in  preliminary  1991  data.  Baja 
California  Sur  reported  no  maternal  deaths  in  1991,  with  sev- 
eral, mostly  northern  states — Chihuahua,  Coahuila,  Durango, 
Jalisco,  Nayarit,  Nuevo  Leon,  Sinaloa,  Tabasco,  and  Tamauli- 
pas— indicating  rates  below  three  deaths  per  10,000  registered 
live  births.  In  sharp  contrast  stood  Oaxaca,  with  a  rate  exceed- 
ing fourteen  deaths  per  10,000  registered  live  births. 

Morbidity  Patterns 

Although  infectious  diarrhea  and  severe  respiratory  infec- 
tions have  declined  significantly  as  causes  of  mortality,  they 
remain  major  illnesses  in  the  early  1990s.  Reported  cases  of 
infectious  diarrhea  escalated  dramatically  from  1,661  per 
100,000  residents  in  1980  to  2,906  in  1990,  and  to  4,685  in 
1991.  During  the  same  period,  severe  respiratory  infections 
climbed  from  3,334  cases  per  100,000  residents  in  1980  to 
10,800  in  1990,  and  to  13,732  in  1991. 

Mexican  health  officials  reported  substantial  progress  in 
relation  to  several  illnesses  controllable  by  vaccination.  Pertus- 
sis declined  from  122.6  cases  per  100,000  residents  in  1930  to 
4.4  cases  in  1980,  to  1.3  cases  in  1990,  and  to  only  0.2  cases  in 
1991.  Chiapas's  rate  in  1991  stood  at  ten  times  the  national 
average,  however.  The  total  number  of  cases  of  poliomyelitis 
declined  from  682  in  1980  to  seven  in  1990  and  to  zero  in  1991. 
The  government  recorded  only  a  single  case  of  diphtheria  in 
1991.  Measles  epidemics  continued  to  occur,  with  rates  surging 
from  24.2  cases  per  100,000  residents  to  80.2  in  1990  before 
falling  sharply  to  5.9  in  1991.  Even  here,  however,  improve- 
ment over  past  decades  could  be  noted  because  epidemics 
occurred  only  every  four  or  five  years  as  compared  with  the 
previous  pattern  of  occurring  every  other  year.  Somewhat  less 
progress  was  apparent  in  the  campaign  against  tuberculosis, 
with  rates  declining  from  16.1  cases  per  100,000  residents  in 
1980  to  14.3  in  1990. 

Vector-transmitted  illnesses  remain  major  public  health  chal- 
lenges, especially  in  southern  Mexico.  Malaria  increased  dra- 
matically from  36.9  cases  per  100,000  residents  in  1980  to  171.5 
cases  in  1985,  before  dropping  to  31.1  in  1991.  Chiapas, 
Oaxaca,  Guerrero,  Michoacan,  and  Sinaloa  are  priority  areas

for  government  antimalarial  campaigns.  After  not  a  single  case 
of  onchocerciasis  was  reported  in  1980  and  1985,  the  disease 
reemerged  in  the  late  1980s.  Health  officials  identified  2,905 
cases  in  1987  and  1,238  cases  in  1991,  most  of  them  in  Oaxaca 
and  Chiapas.  In  contrast,  significant  progress  occurred  in  the 
reduction  of  dengue,  with  cases  per  100,000  residents  declin- 
ing from  73.8  in  1980  to  6.9  in  1991.  The  disease  is  found  along 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  Pacific  coastal  regions,  the  mouth  of 
the  Rio  Balsas,  and  central  Chiapas. 

Although  most  sexually  transmitted  diseases  declined 
throughout  the  1980s,  acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome 
(AIDS)  proved  a  glaring  and  deadly  exception.  Mexico 
reported  its  first  cases  of  AIDS  in  1983.  Both  the  total  number 
of  cases  and  the  ratio  increased  annually  through  1993.  In  1993 
the  government  reported  5,095  new  cases,  or  5.4  cases  per 
100,000  residents. 

Social  Security 

Mexico's  social  security  agencies  are  financed  through  con- 
tributions from  members,  employers,  and  the  government.  In 
the  mid-1990s,  contributions  averaged  around  25  percent  of 
members'  salaries.  Although  informal-sector  workers  may  sub- 
scribe to  the  IMSS,  they  are  effectively  prevented  from  doing  so 
because  they  must  pay  not  only  their  own  share  but  that  of 
their  employers  as  well.  Members  are  eligible  for  a  wide  array 
of  benefits  including  pension,  disability,  and  maternity  cover- 
age. A  variety  of  other  services  are  also  available  to  all  Mexi- 
cans, including  theaters,  vacation  centers,  funeral  parlors,  and 
day-care  centers.  Approximately  1.5  million  Mexicans  received 
monthly  pensions  in  the  mid-1990s,  a  higher  figure  than  in  pre- 
vious decades,  reflecting  gains  in  average  life  expectancy. 

An  actuarial  crisis  is  expected  to  threaten  the  fiscal  solvency 
of  the  social  security  system  by  the  early  twenty-first  century. 
Analyst  Carmelo  Mesa-Lago  has  noted  numerous  problems 
confronting  the  system,  including  rising  administrative  expen- 
ditures, redundant  physical  plants,  the  high  costs  of  complex 
medical  technology  for  IMSS's  approximately  1,700  hospitals, 
and  continual  transfers  of  pension  funds  to  cover  deficits  in  dis- 
ability and  maternity  programs.  In  early  1996,  IMSS  projected 
its  first  annual  budget  deficit.  In  December  1995,  the  legisla- 
ture approved  a  plan  to  enhance  the  viability  of  social  security 
by  expanding  its  contributory  base  from  the  informal  sector.  In 
addition,  Mexicans  can  establish  privately  operated  individual 


138 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

retirement  accounts.  That  element  of  the  plan,  to  take  effect  in 
January  1997,  was  also  designed  to  increase  domestic  savings  to 
finance  future  economic  growth. 

Despite  impressive  gains  in  the  health  care  system  during  the 
second  half  of  the  twentieth  century,  Mexico's  health  care  and 
education  systems  and,  indeed,  its  entire  society  remain  in  a 
profound  state  of  transition.  The  population  of  states  in  north- 
ern Mexico  and  many  urban  areas  exhibits  social  indicators  on 
a  par  with  those  of  developed  countries,  whereas  statistics  for 
southern  Mexico  and  most  rural  areas  are  comparable  to  those 
of  the  developing  world.  One  of  the  key  challenges  for  Mexico 
in  the  twenty-first  century,  therefore,  will  be  to  meet  the  needs 
of  a  rapidly  expanding  and  urbanizing  population  while  con- 
tinuing to  improve  living  conditions  for  the  many  disadvan- 
taged segments  of  its  society.

A  representation  of  Mexican  campesinos,  from  a  painting  by  Diego  Rivera 


FROM  THE  1940s  UNTIL  THE  MID-1970S,  the  Mexican  econ- 
omy enjoyed  strong  growth  averaging  more  than  6  percent,  sin- 
gle-digit inflation,  and  relatively  low  external  indebtedness. 
These  conditions  all  began  to  change  during  the  1970s.  Expan- 
sionary government  policies  generated  higher  inflation  and 
severe  external  payments  problems  while  failing  to  produce 
sustained  growth.  Government  spending  outpaced  revenues, 
generating  steep  budget  deficits  and  increased  external  indebt- 
edness. Low  real  interest  rates  also  discouraged  domestic  sav- 
ing. 

A  brief  financial  and  economic  crisis  in  1976  signaled  the 
need  to  address  the  economy's  fundamental  problems,  but  sub- 
sequent petroleum  discoveries  reduced  incentives  for  reform 
and  postponed  the  inevitable  day  of  reckoning.  The  govern- 
ment expanded  its  debt-financed  spending  in  the  late  1970s  in 
anticipation  of  continued  low  interest  rates  and  high  oil  reve- 
nue. It  also  maintained  a  highly  overvalued  peso  (for  value  of 
the  peso — see  Glossary),  aggravating  balance  of  payments 
problems,  undermining  private-sector  confidence,  and  encour- 
aging capital  flight. 

External  conditions  turned  sharply  against  Mexico  in  the 
early  1980s,  producing  a  deep  recession  that  forced  a  funda- 
mental change  in  the  country's  decades-old  development  strat- 
egy. Higher  interest  rates  and  falling  oil  prices  combined  with 
rising  inflation,  massive  capital  flight,  and  an  unserviceable  for- 
eign debt  to  provoke  an  economic  collapse.  Lacking  access  to 
international  capital  markets,  the  government  of  Miguel  de  la 
Madrid  Hurtado  (1982-88)  had  to  generate  huge  nonoil  trade 
surpluses  to  restore  macroeconomic  balance.  Import  volume 
fell  sharply  at  the  expense  of  fixed  investment  and  consump- 
tion. As  a  result  of  the  government's  stringent  economic  stabili- 
zation program,  the  fiscal  deficit  was  eliminated,  international 
reserves  rebuilt,  and  export  growth  restored,  but  at  the  cost  of 
lower  real  wages  and  extensive  unemployment.  Economic  out- 
put remained  flat  between  1983  and  1988,  and  inflation 
remained  high,  reaching  more  than  140  percent  in  1987.  Real 
exchange-rate  depreciation  boosted  the  country's  debt-to-gross 
domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  ratio  by  almost  30  per- 
centage points  between  1982  and  1987.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

To  control  persistently  high  inflation  and  restore  growth  and 
international  competitiveness,  the  government  pursued  a 
major  policy  reorientation  in  the  late  1980s.  It  reduced  state 
involvement  in  economic  production  and  regulation  and  inte- 
grated Mexico  more  fully  into  the  world  economy.  An  anti- 
inflation  plan  was  introduced  in  late  1987  under  which  the  gov- 
ernment, the  private  sector,  and  organized  labor  agreed  to 
limit  wage  and  price  increases.  In  1989  the  government 
reached  agreement  with  its  external  creditors  on  extensive 
debt  restructuring  and  reduction. 

In  an  effort  to  restore  self-sustaining  growth,  the  administra- 
tion of  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari  (1988-94)  boosted  investment 
as  a  share  of  GDP.  It  also  accelerated  the  privatization  of  state- 
owned  productive  enterprises,  both  to  raise  state  revenue  and 
to  promote  economic  restructuring  and  modernization.  The 
government  eased  foreign  investment  regulations,  stabilized 
the  currency,  deregulated  the  prices  of  most  goods,  and 
enacted  extensive  trade  liberalization  measures,  including  the 
reduction  or  elimination  of  import  barriers  and  the  pursuit  of 
free-trade  agreements  with  Mexico's  trading  partners,  espe- 
cially the  United  States. 

The  Salinas  government  allowed  the  currency  to  become 
increasingly  overvalued  during  1994,  despite  mounting  trade 
and  current  account  deficits  resulting  from  trade  liberalization 
and  economic  growth.  It  kept  real  interest  rates  high  to  ensure 
sufficient  inflows  of  foreign  (mainly  short-term  portfolio) 
investment  to  cover  the  current  account  deficit.  During  1994 
the  government  treasury  issued  a  large  number  of  dollar- 
denominated  bonds  (tesebonos)  to  reinforce  its  capital  position. 

By  the  end  of  1994,  the  almost  total  disappearance  of 
Mexico's  international  reserves  made  the  government's 
exchange-rate  policy  no  longer  tenable.  The  new  administra- 
tion of  President  Ernesto  Zedillo  Ponce  de  Leon  was  forced  in 
December  1994  to  devalue  the  new  peso  (for  value  of  the  new 
peso — see  Glossary),  despite  promises  to  the  contrary.  The  gov- 
ernment's mismanaged  new  peso  devaluation  cost  the  currency 
nearly  half  of  its  value  and  the  government  much  of  its  credibil- 
ity and  popular  support.  Inflation  and  interest  rates  rose 
sharply  in  subsequent  weeks,  throwing  millions  of  Mexicans 
out  of  work  and  putting  many  consumer  goods  beyond  the 
reach  of  the  middle  class,  to  say  nothing  of  the  impoverished 
majority.  Public  and  private  investment  plummeted,  and 
Mexico  entered  its  worst  economic  recession  since  the  1930s.

The  Economy 


By  early  1996,  however,  the  economy  had  begun  to  recover,  as 
capital  inflows  increased  and  most  productive  sectors  regis- 
tered positive  growth  rates. 

Growth  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 
Early  Years 

The  Mexican  wars  of  independence  (1810-21)  left  a  legacy 
of  economic  stagnation  that  persisted  until  the  1870s.  Political 
instability  and  foreign  invasion  deterred  foreign  investment, 
risk-taking,  and  innovation.  Most  available  capital  left  with  its 
Spanish  owners  following  independence.  Instead  of  investing 
in  productive  enterprises  and  thereby  spurring  economic 
growth,  many  wealthy  Mexicans  converted  their  assets  into  tan- 
gible, secure,  and  often  unproductive  property. 

The  seeds  of  economic  modernization  were  laid  under  the 
restored  Republic  (1867-76)  (see  The  Restoration,  1867-76, 
ch.  1).  President  Benito  Juarez  (1855-72)  sought  to  attract  for- 
eign capital  to  finance  Mexico's  economic  modernization.  His 
government  revised  the  tax  and  tariff  structure  to  revitalize  the 
mining  industry,  and  it  improved  the  transportation  and  com- 
munications infrastructure  to  allow  fuller  exploitation  of  the 
country's  natural  resources.  The  government  let  contracts  for 
construction  of  a  new  rail  line  northward  to  the  United  States, 
and  it  completed  the  commercially  vital  Mexico  City-Veracruz 
railroad,  begun  in  1837.  Protected  by  high  tariffs,  Mexico's  tex- 
tile industry  doubled  its  production  of  processed  items 
between  1854  and  1877.  But  overall,  manufacturing  grew  only 
modestly,  and  economic  stagnation  continued. 

During  the  Porfiriato  (1876-1910),  however,  Mexico  under- 
went rapid  and  sustained  growth,  and  laid  the  foundations  for 
a  modern  economy.  Taking  "order  and  progress"  as  his  watch- 
words, President  Jose  de  la  Cruz  Porfirio  Diaz  established  the 
rule  of  law,  political  stability,  and  social  peace,  which  brought 
the  increased  capital  investment  that  would  finance  national 
development  and  modernization.  Rural  banditry  was  sup- 
pressed, communications  and  transportation  facilities  were 
modernized,  and  local  customs  duties  that  had  hindered 
domestic  trade  were  abolished. 

Revolution  and  Aftermath 

The  Mexican  Revolution  (1910-20)  severely  disrupted  the 
Mexican  economy,  erasing  many  of  the  gains  achieved  during 


145 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

the  Porfiriato.  The  labor  force  declined  sharply,  with  the  eco- 
nomically active  share  of  the  population  falling  from  35  per- 
cent in  1910  to  31  percent  in  1930.  Between  1910  and  1921,  the 
population  suffered  an  overall  net  decline  of  360,000  people. 
The  livestock  supply  was  severely  depleted,  as  thousands  of  cat- 
tle were  lost  to  the  depredations  of  rival  militias.  Cotton,  cof- 
fee, and  sugarcane  went  unharvested  as  workers  abandoned 
the  fields  either  to  join  or  flee  the  fighting.  The  result  was  a 
precipitous  drop  in  agricultural  output.  The  disruption  of  com- 
munications and  rail  transportation  made  distribution  unreli- 
able, prompting  further  reductions  in  the  production  of 
perishable  goods.  As  agricultural  and  manufacturing  output 
declined,  black  markets  flourished  in  the  major  cities.  The 
banking  system  was  shattered,  public  credit  disappeared,  and 
the  currency  was  destroyed.  The  mining  sector  suffered  huge 
losses,  with  gold  production  falling  some  80  percent  between 
1910  and  1916,  and  silver  and  copper  output  each  declining  65 
percent. 

The  Great  Depression 

The  Great  Depression  brought  Mexico  a  sharp  drop  in 
national  income  and  internal  demand  after  1929,  challenging 
the  country's  ability  to  fulfill  its  constitutional  mandate  to  pro- 
mote social  equity.  Still,  Mexico  did  not  feel  the  effects  of  the 
Great  Depression  as  directly  as  some  other  countries  did. 

In  the  early  1930s,  manufacturing  and  other  sectors  serving 
the  domestic  economy  began  a  slow  recovery.  The  upturn  was 
facilitated  by  several  key  structural  reforms,  notably  the  rail- 
road nationalization  of  1929  and  1930,  the  nationalization  of 
the  petroleum  industry  in  1938,  and  the  acceleration  of  land 
reform,  first  under  President  Emilio  Portes  Gil  (1928-30)  and 
then  under  President  Lazaro  Cardenas  (1934-40)  in  the  late 
1930s.  To  foster  industrial  expansion,  the  administration  of 
Manuel  Avila  Camacho  (1940-46)  in  1941  reorganized  the 
National  Finance  Bank  (Nacional  Financiera — Nafinsa) ,  which 
had  originally  been  created  in  1934  as  an  investment  bank. 

During  the  1930s,  agricultural  production  also  rose  steadily, 
and  urban  employment  expanded  in  response  to  rising  domes- 
tic demand.  The  government  offered  tax  incentives  for  produc- 
tion directed  toward  the  home  market.  Import-substitution 
industrialization  (see  Glossary)  began  to  make  a  slow  advance 
during  the  1930s,  although  it  was  not  yet  official  government 
policy. 


146 


The  Economy 


Postwar  Economic  Growth 

Mexico's  inward-looking  development  strategy  produced  sus- 
tained economic  growth  of  3  to  4  percent  and  modest  3  per- 
cent inflation  annually  from  the  1940s  until  the  late  1960s.  The 
government  fostered  the  development  of  consumer  goods 
industries  directed  toward  domestic  markets  by  imposing  high 
protective  tariffs  and  other  barriers  to  imports.  The  share  of 
imports  subject  to  licensing  requirements  rose  from  28  percent 
in  1956  to  an  average  of  more  than  60  percent  during  the 
1960s  and  about  70  percent  in  the  1970s.  Industry  accounted 
for  22  percent  of  total  output  in  1950,  24  percent  in  1960,  and 
29  percent  in  1970.  The  share  of  total  output  arising  from  agri- 
culture and  other  primary  activities  declined  during  the  same 
period,  while  services  stayed  constant.  The  government  pro- 
moted industrial  expansion  through  public  investment  in  agri- 
cultural, energy,  and  transportation  infrastructure.  Cities  grew 
rapidly  during  these  years,  reflecting  the  shift  of  employment 
from  agriculture  to  industry  and  services.  The  urban  popula- 
tion increased  at  a  high  rate  after  1940  (see  Urban  Society,  ch. 
2).  Growth  of  the  urban  labor  force  exceeded  even  the  growth 
rate  of  industrial  employment,  with  surplus  workers  taking  low- 
paying  service  jobs. 

In  the  years  following  World  War  II,  President  Miguel  Ale- 
man  Valdes's  (1946-52)  full-scale  import-substitution  program 
stimulated  output  by  boosting  internal  demand.  The  govern- 
ment raised  import  controls  on  consumer  goods  but  relaxed 
them  on  capital  goods,  which  it  purchased  with  international 
reserves  accumulated  during  the  war.  The  government  pro- 
gressively undervalued  the  peso  to  reduce  the  costs  of 
imported  capital  goods  and  expand  productive  capacity,  and  it 
spent  heavily  on  infrastructure.  By  1950  Mexico's  road  network 
had  expanded  to  21,000  kilometers,  of  which  some  13,600  were 
paved. 

Mexico's  strong  economic  performance  continued  into  the 
1960s,  when  GDP  growth  averaged  about  7  percent  overall  and 
about  3  percent  per  capita.  Consumer  price  inflation  averaged 
only  3  percent  annually.  Manufacturing  remained  the  coun- 
try's dominant  growth  sector,  expanding  7  percent  annually 
and  attracting  considerable  foreign  investment.  Mining  grew  at 
an  annual  rate  of  nearly  4  percent,  trade  at  6  percent,  and  agri- 
culture at  3  percent.  By  1970  Mexico  had  diversified  its  export 
base  and  become  largely  self-sufficient  in  food  crops,  steel,  and 


147 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

most  consumer  goods.  Although  its  imports  remained  high, 
most  were  capital  goods  used  to  expand  domestic  production. 

Deterioration  in  the  1 970s 

Although  the  Mexican  economy  maintained  its  rapid  growth 
during  most  of  the  1970s,  it  was  progressively  undermined  by 
fiscal  mismanagement  and  a  resulting  sharp  deterioration  of 
the  investment  climate.  The  GDP  grew  more  than  6  percent 
annually  during  the  administration  of  President  Luis  Echeve- 
rna  Alvarez  (1970-76),  and  at  about  a  6  percent  rate  during 
that  of  his  successor,  Jose  Lopez  Portillo  y  Pacheco  (1976-82). 
But  economic  activity  fluctuated  wildly  during  the  decade,  with 
spurts  of  rapid  growth  followed  by  sharp  depressions  in  1976 
and  1982. 

Fiscal  profligacy  combined  with  the  1973  oil  shock  to  exacer- 
bate inflation  and  upset  the  balance  of  payments.  Moreover, 
President  Echeverria's  leftist  rhetoric  and  actions — such  as 
abetting  illegal  land  seizures  by  peasants — eroded  investor  con- 
fidence and  alienated  the  private  sector.  The  balance  of  pay- 
ments disequilibrium  became  unmanageable  as  capital  flight 
intensified,  forcing  the  government  in  1976  to  devalue  the 
peso  by  45  percent.  The  action  ended  Mexico's  twenty-year 
fixed  exchange  rate. 

Although  significant  oil  discoveries  in  1976  allowed  a  tempo- 
rary recovery,  the  windfall  from  petroleum  sales  also  allowed 
continuation  of  Echeverria's  destructive  fiscal  policies.  In  the 
mid-1970s,  Mexico  went  from  being  a  net  importer  of  oil  and 
petroleum  products  to  a  significant  exporter.  Oil  and  petro- 
chemicals became  the  economy's  most  dynamic  growth  sector. 
Rising  oil  income  allowed  the  government  to  continue  its 
expansionary  fiscal  policy,  partially  financed  by  higher  foreign 
borrowing.  Between  1978  and  1981,  the  economy  grew  more 
than  8  percent  annually,  as  the  government  spent  heavily  on 
energy,  transportation,  and  basic  industries.  Manufacturing 
output  expanded  modestly  during  these  years,  growing  by  9 
percent  in  1978,  9  percent  in  1979,  and  6  percent  in  1980. 

This  renewed  growth  rested  on  shaky  foundations.  Mexico's 
external  indebtedness  mounted,  and  the  peso  became  increas- 
ingly overvalued,  hurting  nonoil  exports  in  the  late  1970s  and 
forcing  a  second  peso  devaluation  in  1980.  Production  of  basic 
food  crops  stagnated,  forcing  Mexico  in  the  early  1980s  to 
become  a  net  importer  of  foodstuffs.  The  portion  of  import 
categories  subject  to  controls  rose  from  20  percent  of  the  total 


148 


The  Economy 


in  1977  to  24  percent  in  1979.  The  government  raised  tariffs 
concurrently  to  shield  domestic  producers  from  foreign  com- 
petition, further  hampering  the  modernization  and  competi- 
tiveness of  Mexican  industry. 

1982  Crisis  and  Recovery 

The  macroeconomic  policies  of  the  1970s  left  Mexico's  econ- 
omy highly  vulnerable  to  external  conditions.  These  turned 
sharply  against  Mexico  in  the  early  1980s,  and  caused  the  worst 
recession  since  the  1930s.  By  mid-1981,  Mexico  was  beset  by 
falling  oil  prices,  higher  world  interest  rates,  rising  inflation,  a 
chronically  overvalued  peso,  and  a  deteriorating  balance  of 
payments  that  spurred  massive  capital  flight.  This  disequilib- 
rium, along  with  the  virtual  disappearance  of  Mexico's  interna- 
tional reserves — by  the  end  of  1982  they  were  insufficient  to 
cover  three  weeks'  imports — forced  the  government  to  devalue 
the  peso  three  times  during  1982.  The  devaluation  further 
fueled  inflation  and  prevented  short-term  recovery.  The  deval- 
uations depressed  real  wages  and  increased  the  private  sector's 
burden  in  servicing  its  dollar-denominated  debt.  Interest  pay- 
ments on  long-term  debt  alone  were  equal  to  28  percent  of 
export  revenue.  Cut  off  from  additional  credit,  the  govern- 
ment declared  an  involuntary  moratorium  on  debt  payments 
in  August  1982,  and  the  following  month  it  announced  the 
nationalization  of  Mexico's  private  banking  system. 

By  late  1982,  incoming  President  Miguel  de  la  Madrid  had  to 
reduce  public  spending  drastically,  stimulate  exports,  and  fos- 
ter economic  growth  to  balance  the  national  accounts.  Recov- 
ery was  extremely  slow  to  materialize,  however.  The  economy 
stagnated  throughout  the  1980s  as  a  result  of  continuing  nega- 
tive terms  of  trade,  high  domestic  interest  rates,  and  scarce 
credit.  Widespread  fears  that  the  government  might  fail  to 
achieve  fiscal  balance  and  have  to  expand  the  money  supply 
and  raise  taxes  deterred  private  investment  and  encouraged 
massive  capital  flight  that  further  increased  inflationary  pres- 
sures. The  resulting  reduction  in  domestic  savings  impeded 
growth,  as  did  the  government's  rapid  and  drastic  reductions  in 
public  investment  and  its  raising  of  real  domestic  interest  rates 
to  deter  capital  flight. 

Mexico's  GDP  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  just  0.1  percent  per 
year  between  1983  and  1988,  while  inflation  stayed  extremely 
high  (see  table  7,  Appendix).  Public  consumption  grew  at  an 
average  annual  rate  of  less  than  2  percent,  and  private  con- 


149 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


sumption  not  at  all.  Total  investment  fell  at  an  average  annual 
rate  of  4  percent  and  public  investment  at  an  11  percent  pace. 
Throughout  the  1980s,  the  productive  sectors  of  the  economy 
contributed  a  decreasing  share  to  GDP,  while  the  services  sec- 
tors expanded  their  share,  reflecting  the  rapid  growth  of  the 
informal  economy.  De  la  Madrid's  stabilization  strategy 
imposed  high  social  costs:  real  disposable  income  per  capita 
fell  5  percent  each  year  between  1983  and  1988.  High  levels  of 
unemployment  and  underemployment,  especially  in  rural 
areas,  stimulated  migration  to  Mexico  City  and  to  the  United 
States. 

By  1988  inflation  was  at  last  under  control,  fiscal  and  mone- 
tary discipline  attained,  relative  price  adjustment  achieved, 
structural  reform  in  trade  and  public-sector  management 
underway,  and  the  preconditions  for  recovery  in  place.  But 
these  positive  developments  were  inadequate  to  attract  foreign 
investment  and  return  capital  in  sufficient  quantities  for  sus- 
tained recovery.  A  shift  in  development  strategy  became  neces- 
sary, predicated  on  the  need  to  generate  a  net  capital  inflow. 

In  April  1989,  President  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari  an- 
nounced his  government's  national  development  plan  for 
1989-94,  which  called  for  annual  GDP  growth  of  6  percent  and 
an  inflation  rate  similar  to  those  of  Mexico's  main  trading  part- 
ners. Salinas  planned  to  achieve  this  sustained  growth  by  boost- 
ing the  investment  share  of  GDP  and  by  encouraging  private 
investment  through  denationalization  of  state  enterprises  and 
deregulation  of  the  economy.  His  first  priority  was  to  reduce 
Mexico's  external  debt;  in  mid-1989  the  government  reached 
agreement  with  its  commercial  bank  creditors  to  reduce  its 
medium-  and  long-term  debt.  The  following  year,  Salinas  took 
his  next  step  toward  higher  capital  inflows  by  lowering  domes- 
tic borrowing  costs,  reprivatizing  the  banking  system,  and 
broaching  the  idea  of  a  free-trade  agreement  with  the  United 
States.  These  announcements  were  soon  followed  by  increased 
levels  of  capital  repatriation  and  foreign  investment. 

After  rising  impressively  during  the  early  years  of  Salinas's 
presidency,  the  growth  rate  of  real  GDP  began  to  slow  during 
the  early  1990s.  During  1993  the  economy  grew  by  a  negligible 
amount,  but  growth  rebounded  to  almost  4  percent  during 
1994,  as  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  were  relaxed  and  foreign 
investment  was  bolstered  by  United  States  ratification  of  the 
North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA).  In  1994  the 
commerce  and  services  sectors  accounted  for  22  percent  of 


150 


The  Economy 


Mexico's  total  GDP.  Manufacturing  followed  at  20  percent; 
transport  and  communications  at  10  percent;  agriculture,  for- 
estry, and  fishing  at  8  percent;  construction  at  5  percent;  min- 
ing at  2  percent;  and  electricity,  gas,  and  water  at  2  percent  (see 
fig.  9).  Some  two-thirds  of  GDP  in  1994  (67  percent)  was  spent 
on  private  consumption,  11  percent  on  public  consumption, 
and  22  percent  on  fixed  investment.  During  1994  private  con- 
sumption rose  by  4  percent,  public  consumption  by  2  percent, 
public  investment  by  9  percent,  and  private  investment  by  8 
percent. 

However,  the  collapse  of  the  new  peso  in  December  1994 
and  the  ensuing  economic  crisis  caused  the  economy  to  con- 
tract by  an  estimated  7  percent  during  1995.  Investment  and 
consumption  both  fell  sharply,  the  latter  by  some  10  percent. 
Agriculture,  livestock,  and  fishing  contracted  by  4  percent; 
mining  by  1  percent;  manufacturing  by  6  percent;  construction 
by  22  percent;  and  transport,  storage,  and  communications  by 
2  percent.  The  only  sector  to  register  positive  growth  was  utili- 
ties, which  expanded  by  3  percent. 

By  1996  Mexican  government  and  independent  analysts  saw 
signs  that  the  country  had  begun  to  emerge  from  its  economic 
recession.  The  economy  contracted  by  a  modest  1  percent  dur- 
ing the  first  quarter  of  1996.  The  Mexican  government 
reported  strong  growth  of  7  percent  for  the  second  quarter, 
and  the  Union  Bank  of  Switzerland  forecast  economic  growth 
of  4  percent  for  all  of  1996. 

Macroeconomic  Management 

In  the  1940s,  Mexico  adopted  a  state-led  development  strat- 
egy that  relied  on  public-sector  investment  to  integrate  the 
national  economy.  Under  the  policy  of  "stabilizing  develop- 
ment," the  state  promoted  industrialization  by  encouraging 
import  substitution,  mobilizing  domestic  savings,  and  directing 
state  credit  toward  priority  investment  projects.  It  followed  con- 
servative policies  on  interest  and  exchange  rates  in  order  to 
attract  external  capital  to  support  industrialization.  During  the 
1940s  and  1950s,  the  government  channeled  public  investment 
toward  the  agricultural  sector,  and  especially  into  large-scale 
irrigation  projects.  During  the  1960s,  public  spending  was  redi- 
rected toward  expanding  the  nation's  industrial  capacity. 

Although  social  infrastructure,  such  as  medical  and  educa- 
tional facilities,  received  some  25  percent  of  public  spending, 
income  distribution  became  steadily  more  unequal  during  the

postwar  decades,  and  the  social  needs  of  the  rural  poor  went 
largely  unaddressed.  Popular  acceptance  of  Mexico's  post-1940 
development  strategy  began  to  wane  by  1970  as  its  inegalitarian 
consequences  became  clear.  As  public  pressure  for  state  redress 
of  social  needs  rose,  presidents  Echeverria  and  Lopez  Portillo 
turned  to  destructive  fiscal  policies  that  nearly  bankrupted  the 
state  and  contributed  to  Mexico's  economic  collapse  in  the 
early  1980s. 

After  taking  power  in  1970,  Echeverria  turned  away  from  the 
policy  of  "stabilizing  development"  that  had  closely  linked 
Mexico's  economic  fortunes  to  those  of  the  private  sector.  By 
expanding  the  state's  role  in  directing  and  regulating  eco- 
nomic activity,  Echeverria  hoped  to  promote  both  equity  and 
prosperity  while  easing  political  pressures  on  the  state.  Higher 
public  spending  was  also  intended  to  alleviate  the  social  and 


152 


The  Economy 


political  tensions  that  had  found  violent  expression  in  the  riots 
at  the  Plaza  of  the  Three  Cultures  in  Tlatelolco  in  1968  and 
threatened  continued  Institutional  Revolutionary  Party 
(Partido  Revolucionario  Institucional — PRI)  rule  (see  Recon- 
ciliation and  Redistribution,  1970-76,  ch.  1). 

Echeverna's  improvidence  produced  a  growing  fiscal  imbal- 
ance, which  he  financed  through  foreign  borrowing.  Mexico's 
public-sector  deficit  rose  sharply  from  2  percent  of  GDP  in 
1970  to  7  percent  by  1976.  Under  Echeverria,  Mexico  resorted 
for  the  first  time  to  massive  external  borrowing  to  finance 
these  deficits.  Extensive  oil  discoveries  in  the  mid-1970s  gave 
Mexico  access  to  almost  unlimited  foreign  credits,  allowing  the 
government  to  contract  huge  loans  to  finance  the  fiscal  and 
trade  deficits.  The  share  of  public-sector  spending  financed  by 
debt  rose  from  32  percent  in  1971  to  50  percent  by  1977.  The 
looming  fiscal  crisis,  together  with  the  president's  intemperate 
rhetorical  assaults  on  the  private  sector,  undermined  business 
confidence  and  soured  the  investment  climate.  The  govern- 
ment's determination  to  maintain  a  fixed  exchange  rate 
despite  rising  inflation  undermined  the  competitiveness  of 
domestic  production,  discouraged  new  investment,  and 
encouraged  capital  flight. 

By  the  mid-1970s,  the  balance  of  payments  disequilibrium 
had  become  unmanageable.  Inflation  increased  from  3  per- 
cent in  1969  to  an  annual  average  of  17  percent  between  1973 
and  1975.  The  fiscal  deficit  rose  from  3  percent  of  GDP  in  1971 
to  10  percent  in  1975.  During  those  same  years,  the  current 
account  deficit  rose  from  US$0.9  billion  to  US$4.4  billion,  and 
the  foreign  public  debt  more  than  doubled  from  US$6.7  bil- 
lion to  US$15.7  billion.  The  private  sector  responded  with  mas- 
sive capital  flight,  both  to  protect  against  the  expected  peso 
devaluation  and  to  protest  Echeverna's  attacks  on  the  private 
sector. 

By  1976  the  government  could  no  longer  ignore  the  crisis. 
Complying  with  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glos- 
sary) requirements  for  contingency  lending  and  private-sector 
demands,  the  government  curbed  the  expansion  of  state  indus- 
try and  public-sector  spending,  restricted  credit,  and  forced 
the  economy  into  recession.  In  August  1976,  the  government 
allowed  the  peso  to  float,  ending  more  than  twenty  years  of 
exchange-rate  stability.  The  peso  quickly  depreciated  by  almost 
40  percent  against  the  dollar.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Although  the  discovery  of  massive  new  petroleum  deposits 
in  1977  briefly  alleviated  the  fiscal  pressures  weighing  upon  the 
government,  it  also  led  officials  to  abandon  their  newly 
acquired  habits  of  fiscal  restraint  (see  Recovery  and  Relapse, 
ch.  1).  The  fiscally  expansionist  Secretariat  of  Programming 
and  Budget  (Secretana  de  Programacion  y  Presupuesto — SPP), 
which  had  been  established  in  1977  and  given  responsibility  for 
public  investment  planning,  grew  in  influence  at  the  expense 
of  technocrats  from  the  Central  Bank  and  Treasury  Ministry, 
who  were  more  concerned  with  maintaining  macroeconomic 
efficiency  and  stability. 

The  denouement  of  Lopez  Portillo's  expansionary  policies 
came  in  mid-1981.  International  interest  rates  rose  and  oil 
prices  fell.  Capital  flight  accelerated  as  the  government 
defended  the  increasingly  overvalued  peso  through  short-term 
external  borrowing.  Despite  the  warning  signs,  Lopez  Portillo 
decided  to  postpone  adjustment  measures  and  maintain  exist- 
ing policy. 

In  late  1982,  the  incoming  administration  of  President  de  la 
Madrid  faced  a  raft  of  challenges:  huge  fiscal  imbalances, 
unsympathetic  creditor  banks,  an  alienated  private  sector,  and 
international  institutions  inexperienced  in  managing  a  global 
debt  crisis  (see  The  de  la  Madrid  Sexenio,  1982-88,  ch.  1). 
Mexico's  public-sector  deficit  in  1982  amounted  to  18  percent 
of  GDP.  Total  public  spending  amounted  to  nearly  47  percent 
of  GDP,  compared  with  only  30  percent  in  1977,  while  public- 
sector  revenue  rose  during  the  same  period  from  24  percent  of 
GDP  in  1977  to  only  30  percent  in  1982.  Both  production  and 
economic  growth  stagnated. 

Despite  having  vowed  to  defend  the  peso  "like  a  dog,"  in 
February  1982  the  president  allowed  the  dollar  price  of  the 
peso  to  almost  double  to  discourage  foreign-exchange  specula- 
tion. The  exchange  rate  rose  from  more  than  twenty-six  pesos 
per  dollar  in  January  1982  to  about  forty-five  three  months 
later.  In  August  of  that  year,  the  government  announced  three 
more  dramatic  devaluations  of  the  peso  and  a  ninety-day  sus- 
pension of  debt  principal  payments.  It  also  began  negotiations 
for  bridge  loans  and  rescheduling  agreements  with  the  United 
States  treasury,  the  IMF,  and  private  commercial  banks.  In  Sep- 
tember the  government  adopted  full  exchange  controls  and 
nationalized  the  domestic  banking  system  in  a  mistaken  effort 
to  stem  capital  flight.  In  November  the  government  concluded 


154 


The  Economy 


a  rescheduling  accord  with  the  IMF,  and  in  early  1993  it  negoti- 
ated a  US$10  billion  rescue  package  with  private  banks. 

In  December  1982,  de  la  Madrid  announced  what  turned 
out  to  be  his  first  stabilization  package,  the  Immediate  Eco- 
nomic Reorganization  Program  (Programa  Inmediato  de  Reor- 
denacion  Economica — PIRE).  This  two-stage  program  called 
for  "shock"  treatment  in  1983  to  restore  macroeconomic  bal- 
ance, to  be  followed  in  1984  and  1985  by  a  "gradualist"  adjust- 
ment program  to  open  the  economy  to  market  forces.  The  first 
phase  was  intended  to  restore  price  and  financial  stability  by 
means  of  a  sharp  reduction  in  public  spending  and  a  steep 
peso  devaluation.  The  government  instituted  a  harsh  austerity 
regime  that  held  the  growth  in  domestic  spending  far  below 
the  rise  in  total  output. 

De  la  Madrid's  first  stabilization  package  did  not  work  as 
expected.  The  government  had  expected  lower  inflation  and 
more  realistic  prices  to  produce  strong  economic  growth  by 
1984.  This  did  not  take  place.  From  early  1983  until  mid-1984, 
the  government  adhered  closely  to  the  goals  of  a  November 
1982  agreement  it  had  reached  with  the  IMF.  The  agreement 
maintained  highly  restrictive  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  and 
allowed  wages  to  lag  substantially  behind  inflation.  The  auster- 
ity measures  and  devaluations  of  1983  eliminated  both  the  fis- 
cal and  trade  deficits,  but  at  the  cost  of  sharply  reduced 
imports  and  a  severe  economic  recession.  Contrary  to  expecta- 
tions, the  inflation  rate  did  not  fall  significantly,  and  voluntary 
private  lending  did  not  resume. 

Increasingly  concerned  about  Mexico's  growing  fiscal  deficit 
and  its  failure  to  reach  its  economic  targets,  the  IMF  in  Septem- 
ber 1985  suspended  disbursement  of  the  loan  it  had  approved 
in  late  1982.  This  announcement  led  to  another  run  on  the 
peso  and  a  new  balance-of-payments  crisis.  The  government 
reacted  to  the  situation  by  imposing  a  series  of  devaluations 
and  further  harsh  stabilization  measures,  including  additional 
reductions  in  spending  and  domestic  credit.  Economic  growth 
slowed  and  inflation  surged,  suggesting  the  failure  of  de  la 
Madrid's  first  stabilization  package. 

In  1985  the  Mexican  government  signaled  a  fundamental 
change  in  development  strategy  by  reorienting  economic  pol- 
icy toward  trade  liberalization  and  export  promotion.  It 
expected  renewed  export  promotion  to  restore  external  bal- 
ance and  trade  liberalization  to  restrain  domestic  prices  by 
encouraging  import  competition.  In  July  1985,  the  government 


155 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

substantially  reduced  import  licensing  requirements  and  raised 
the  share  of  total  imports  exempt  from  licensing.  It  compen- 
sated slightly  for  these  measures  by  raising  tariffs.  The  govern- 
ment also  devalued  the  peso  again,  despite  the  inflationary 
consequences,  to  force  previously  protected  domestic  firms  to 
become  more  competitive  against  imported  goods. 

In  late  1986,  the  government  cautiously  relaxed  credit  to  the 
private  sector  in  an  effort  to  ease  the  economy  out  of  recession. 
External  financing  was  again  made  available  in  1987  following 
approval  of  a  debt  rescheduling  plan  proposed  by  United 
States  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  James  A.  Baker  III.  The  Baker 
Plan  called  for  rescheduling  some  83  percent  of  the  US$52.2 
billion  of  public-sector  debt  that  Mexico  had  contracted  prior 
to  1985.  The  debt  would  be  repaid  over  a  twenty-year  period, 
with  a  seven-year  grace  period.  Multilateral  agencies  agreed  to 
lend  an  additional  US$6  billion  and  commercial  banks  an  addi- 
tional US$7.7  billion,  of  which  US$1.7  billion  was  contingency 
lending.  The  Baker  Plan  also  provided  for  rescheduling  some 
US$9.7  billion  of  private  debt  owed  to  commercial  banks  over  a 
twenty-year  period  with  seven  years'  grace.  In  all,  the  1986 
agreement  provided  Mexico  some  US$12.5  billion  in  new  pri- 
vate and  official  credit. 

After  1987  the  government  finally  began  to  make  progress 
against  inflation.  Endemic  price  instability  had  severely  upset 
economic  expectations,  deterred  much-needed  investment, 
and  hindered  the  country's  economic  recovery.  In  an  effort  to 
restore  price  stability,  government  policy  makers  decided  in 
late  1987  to  stop  devaluing  the  peso  at  rates  equal  to  or  higher 
than  the  inflation  rate.  Even  more  important,  in  December 
1987  the  government  forged  a  joint  agreement  with  official 
leaders  of  the  labor,  peasant,  and  business  sectors  to  restrain 
wages  and  prices.  This  accord,  known  as  the  Economic  Solidar- 
ity Pact  (Pacto  de  Solidaridad  Economica — PSE),  promised  to 
reduce  Mexico's  monthly  inflation  rate  to  2  percent  by  the  end 
of  1988. 

The  PSE  required  further  reductions  in  public  spending  and 
credit,  higher  tax  revenue,  and  a  tighter  monetary  policy.  All 
were  intended  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit  and  curb  inflation. 
The  new  revenue  measures  included  an  increase  in  the  value- 
added  tax  (VAT),  a  new  personal  income  surtax,  and  elimina- 
tion of  tax  exemptions.  The  government  raised  prices  of  public 
goods  and  services,  and  allowed  interest  rates  to  rise  in  order  to 
promote  saving  and  reduce  capital  flight.  The  PSE  also 


156 


The  Economy 


included  a  structural  adjustment  component  emphasizing 
trade  liberalization  and  privatization  of  state  enterprises. 

The  plan  soon  produced  results.  The  inflation  rate  fell  con- 
siderably, living  standards  recovered  slightly,  and  economic 
growth  resumed.  Annual  inflation  fell  from  159  percent  in 
1987  to  52  percent  in  1988.  The  gradual  recovery  of  Mexico's 
international  reserves  in  1989  and  1990  allowed  the  govern- 
ment to  sustain  a  credible  fixed  exchange  rate  and  finance  the 
deterioration  in  the  external  account  caused  by  the  tariff 
reductions.  Although  President  de  la  Madrid  was  himself  not 
highly  popular  as  he  approached  the  end  of  his  six-year  term, 
his  government  had  sufficient  authority  and  institutional 
strength  to  enforce  the  wage  restraints  included  in  the  PSE. 

President  Salinas  announced  in  January  1989  a  new  version 
of  de  la  Madrid's  PSE,  called  the  Pact  for  Economic  Stability 
and  Growth  (Pacto  para  la  Estabilidad  y  el  Crecimiento 
Economico — PECE),  which  he  hoped  would  end  Mexico's  net 
capital  outflow.  Salinas's  economic  program  received  consider- 
able external  support  (see  President  Salinas,  ch.  1).  In  March 
1989,  Mexico  and  the  United  States  reached  agreement  on  a 
long-term  plan  to  restructure  Mexico's  US$52.7  billion  debt 
owed  to  commercial  creditors.  The  plan,  proposed  by  United 
States  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  Nicholas  F.  Brady,  was 
intended  to  attract  new  foreign  investment,  encourage  return 
capital,  reduce  domestic  interest  rates,  and  foster  higher 
growth. 

In  July  1989,  Mexico  signed  an  agreement  in  principle  with 
an  advisory  committee  representing  its  500  or  so  international 
creditors.  The  final  agreement  was  signed  in  February  1990 
and  went  into  effect  the  following  month. 

Mexico's  public  finances  improved  steadily  during  the  early 
years  of  Salinas's  presidency.  Throughout  the  1980s,  the  Mexi- 
can government  had  emphasized  fiscal  austerity  while  making 
little  effort  to  raise  tax  revenue.  This  policy  mix  began  to 
change  under  Salinas,  as  Mexican  economic  policy  stopped 
holding  domestic  demand  below  output  and  began  to  tighten 
tax  collection.  The  government  broadened  the  tax  base  by 
reducing  marginal  tax  rates,  the  maximum  corporate  and  per- 
sonal tax  rates,  and  the  number  of  personal  income  tax  brack- 
ets. Between  1989  and  1992,  the  number  of  taxpayers  increased 
by  45  percent.  As  a  result  in  part  of  improved  tax  collection, 
Mexico  went  from  a  public-sector  deficit  of  9  percent  of  GDP  in 


157 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

1988  to  a  surplus  of  2  percent  of  GDP  in  1992,  although  the 
government  began  to  relax  fiscal  policy  thereafter. 

In  the  wake  of  the  currency  collapse  of  late  1994,  the  govern- 
ment committed  itself  in  March  1995  to  reduce  public  spend- 
ing by  almost  10  percent  in  real  terms;  it  raised  the  VAT  from 
10  percent  to  15  percent,  and  it  raised  prices  for  fuel,  electric- 
ity, and  other  publicly  provided  services.  Although  the  anti- 
inflationary  social  pact  among  the  government,  business,  and 
labor — the  PECE — was  not  renewed  in  early  1995,  the  govern- 
ment announced  in  October  1995  a  new  pact  with  labor  and 
business,  the  Alliance  for  Economic  Recovery  (Alianza  para  la 
Recuperacion  Economica — APRE),  which  established  fixed 
rates  of  increase  for  wages  and  prices.  Under  the  terms  of  the 
APRE,  the  government  pledged  to  maintain  a  balanced  budget 
during  1996.  It  also  planned  a  5  percent  real  reduction  in  cur- 
rent spending,  as  well  as  regular  increases  in  prices  of  publicly 
provided  goods  and  services.  Unlike  its  predecessors,  however, 
this  measure  was  not  called  a  "pact,"  and  it  included  no  provi- 
sion for  a  crawling-  peg  exchange  rate.  The  government's 
reductions  in  current  spending  and  public  investment  during 
1995  were  especially  severe  because  vastly  higher  interest  rates 
had  boosted  the  government's  interest  payments  by  more  than 
37  percent  in  real  terms. 

These  spending  reductions  helped  the  government  to  move 
from  a  public-sector  deficit  of  1.7  billion  new  pesos  in  1994  to  a 
modest  surplus  of  815  million  new  pesos  in  1995,  the  latter  rep- 
resenting 0.05  percent  of  GDP.  Public  expenditure  in  1995 
totaled  424  billion  new  pesos,  of  which  72  billion  new  pesos  (17 
percent)  went  to  interest  payments,  67  billion  (16  percent)  to 
education,  65  billion  (15  percent)  to  energy,  and  62  billion  (15 
percent)  to  health  and  social  security.  For  1996  the  govern- 
ment budgeted  total  public-sector  revenue  of  558  billion  new 
pesos,  of  which  237  billion  new  pesos  would  come  from  taxa- 
tion and  177  billion  new  pesos  from  state  enterprises.  It  bud- 
geted total  net  expenditures  of  554  billion  new  pesos,  of  which 
the  largest  share  would  go  to  education,  energy,  and  health 
and  social  security,  as  well  as  debt  service. 

External  Debt 

By  the  early  1990s,  Mexico's  debt  crisis  had  largely  passed, 
although  the  country  remained  saddled  with  huge  debts.  Capi- 
tal inflows  were  more  than  sufficient  to  service  the  debt 
through  1993  as  portfolio  and  foreign  direct  investment 


158 


The  Economy 


reached  unprecedented  levels  in  response  to  liberalization  and 
the  successful  negotiation  of  NAFTA.  Despite  the  use  of  funds 
from  privatization  to  retire  old  public-sector  debt,  total  exter- 
nal debt  continued  to  grow  during  the  early  1990s  as  current 
account  deficits  soared  after  1992. 

After  reaching  a  low  of  US$112  billion  in  1992,  Mexico's 
total  external  debt  rose  steadily  thereafter,  reaching  an  esti- 
mated US$158  billion  in  1995.  The  large  increase  during  1995 
in  Mexico's  total  public  indebtedness  resulted  in  part  from 
loans  contracted  in  the  wake  of  the  new  peso  collapse  of  late 
1994.  In  early  1995,  the  United  States  government  made 
US$20  billion  available  to  Mexico  from  the  United  States  trea- 
sury department's  Exchange  Stabilization  Fund,  the  Bank  for 
International  Settlements  contributed  US$10  billion,  and  the 
IMF  offered  US$8  billion  in  standby  credit  and  US$10  billion 
of  other  funding. 

In  1993  Mexico's  total  debt  service  amounted  to  US$21  bil- 
lion, including  US$14  billion  in  principal  payments  and  US$7 
billion  in  interest  payments.  Mexico's  total  external  debt 
amounted  to  356  percent  of  GDP  in  1993. 

Inflation 

Control  of  inflation  was  the  main  policy  objective  of  the  de 
la  Madrid  and  Salinas  administrations  between  1987  and  1993, 
despite  the  cost  of  this  policy  in  terms  of  the  currency's  contin- 
ued real  appreciation  and  the  resultant  need  to  maintain  high 
interest  rates  to  attract  foreign  investment  and  deter  capital 
flight.  The  government  made  steady  progress  against  inflation 
following  the  PSE's  introduction  in  late  1987  (replaced  in  1989 
by  the  PECE,  which  was  revised  and  updated  annually  between 
1989  and  1993).  Largely  as  a  result  of  the  wage  and  price 
restraints  included  in  these  pacts,  inflation  fell  from  159  per- 
cent in  1987  to  20  percent  in  1989.  In  1990  it  rose  slightly  to  30 
percent  (double  the  initial  target  of  15  percent),  as  the  govern- 
ment eased  credit,  eliminated  price  subsidies,  and  realigned 
public-sector  prices  as  well  as  some  private-sector  prices.  There- 
after, the  inflation  rate  fell  steadily  from  23  percent  in  1991  to  7 
percent  in  1994,  Mexico's  first  single-digit  inflation  rate  in 
twenty  years. 

Consumer  price  inflation  rose  sharply  between  January  and 
April  1995  in  response  to  the  December  1994  new  peso  devalu- 
ation, then  abated  between  May  and  August  as  the  new  peso 
appreciated.  When  the  currency  came  under  renewed  pressure 


159

during  the  last  four  months  of  the  year,  however,  inflation  rose 
more  quickly.  It  soared  as  high  as  52  percent  (Mexico's  highest 
inflation  rate  since  1987)  by  December  1995,  although  it  aver- 
aged 35  percent  for  the  year.  A  21  percent  increase  in  the  mini- 
mum wage  and  monthly  adjustments  of  public  prices 
contributed  to  the  high  inflation.  Consumer  prices  rose  by  11 
percent  during  the  first  four  months  of  1996,  despite  Mexico's 
continued  recession  and  the  new  peso's  real  appreciation.  The 
government  conservatively  projected  an  inflation  rate  of  21 
percent  for  all  of  1996. 

Privatization 

Prior  to  1970,  the  Mexican  government  operated  relatively 
few  productive  enterprises.  The  influx  of  oil  revenue  during 
the  1970s,  however,  allowed  the  government  to  vastly  expand 
its  patronage  resources  by  assuming  ownership  of  hundreds  of 
unprofitable  firms.  By  1982  the  Mexican  government  ran  1,155 
businesses,  among  them  public  enterprises  (65  percent  with 
state  majority  ownership  and  6  percent  with  state  minority  own- 
ership), trust  funds,  and  decentralized  agencies.  President  de 
la  Madrid  announced  in  February  1985  that  237  parastatal  (see 
Glossary)  enterprises  would  be  sold  to  private  buyers  as  part  of 
the  government's  campaign  to  raise  state  revenues  and  pro- 
mote economic  efficiency.  Privatization  of  state  enterprises 
accelerated  under  President  Salinas  and  became  a  central  com- 
ponent of  his  structural  adjustment  program.  The  Salinas  team 
began  by  selling  smaller  enterprises,  then  moved  to  larger  and 
more  complicated  firms.  In  November  1993,  Salinas 
announced  that  his  government  had  sold  a  total  of  390  state 
enterprises  (63  percent  of  the  firms  in  state  hands  in  1988), 
and  that  fifty  of  the  remaining  209  enterprises  were  in  the  pro- 
cess of  being  sold,  merged,  or  closed. 

Despite  its  overall  success,  the  privatization  program  elimi- 
nated more  than  400,000  jobs  between  1983  and  1993.  Far 
more  enterprises  were  closed  than  sold,  and  the  overwhelming 
majority  of  the  latter  were  sold  through  acceptance  of  private 
bids,  mainly  from  wealthy  Mexican  investors,  rather  than 
through  stock  offerings  to  employees  or  the  public.  Some 
newly  privatized  enterprises — such  as  Astilleros  Unidos  de 
Veracruz,  Mexico's  largest  shipyard — subsequently  came  close 
to  bankruptcy,  and  several  sugar  mills  closed  soon  after  they 
were  privatized. 


160 


The  Economy 


The  Zedillo  government  continued  its  predecessor's  search 
for  new  privatization  opportunities.  During  1995  it  awarded 
five  concessions  to  joint  ventures  between  Mexican  and  foreign 
companies  to  operate  in  the  long-distance  telecommunications 
market  following  the  expiration  of  the  Mexican  Telephone 
(Telefonos  de  Mexico — Telmex)  monopoly  in  January  1997. 
New  privatization  opportunities  were  expected  to  boost  private 
capital  formation,  which  had  slumped  in  late  1995.  The 
planned  privatization  of  the  secondary  petrochemicals  opera- 
tion, Mexican  Petroleum  (Petroleos  Mexicanos — Pemex),  how- 
ever, had  not  occurred  by  mid-1996,  in  part  because  of 
opposition  from  the  oil  workers'  union  and  elements  within 
the  ruling  party.  The  government  also  delayed  its  offering  of 
railroad  concessions  for  privatization,  partly  out  of  concern 
about  job  losses.  Moreover,  it  had  to  rescue  the  operators  of 
Mexico's  new  private  toll  roads,  who  had  sharply  raised  tolls  to 
recoup  construction  costs  and  then  faced  insolvency  because 
they  had  misjudged  the  volume  of  traffic. 

Labor  Force 

Mexico's  workforce  was  estimated  in  the  1990  census  at  some 
24.3  million.  Workers  constituted  a  relatively  small  share  of  the 
total  population,  in  part  because  of  the  population's  relative 
youth  (38  percent  were  below  the  minimum  working  age  of 
fourteen).  Slightly  more  than  half  of  the  working-age  popula- 
tion (those  aged  fifteen  to  sixty-four)  had  actually  entered  the 
formal  labor  market.  In  the  early  1990s,  an  estimated  500,000 
people  entered  the  labor  force  each  year,  expanding  the  total 
workforce  by  some  3  percent  annually. 

In  1988  employers  and  the  self-employed  constituted  29  per- 
cent of  the  labor  force,  employees  56  percent,  and  unpaid  fam- 
ily workers  15  percent.  Agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing 
employed  some  24  percent  of  the  economically  active  popula- 
tion; manufacturing,  mining,  quarrying,  and  public  utilities 
employed  22  percent;  trade,  hotels,  and  restaurants  employed 
19  percent;  construction  employed  5  percent;  finance  and  real 
estate  employed  5  percent;  transportation  and  communica- 
tions employed  4  percent;  and  21  percent  were  engaged  in 
other  service  work.  About  half  of  all  manufacturing  workers 
were  employed  in  small  and  medium-size  enterprises. 

Partly  because  of  high  unemployment  in  the  formal  labor 
sector,  the  number  of  informal-sector  workers  swelled  during 
the  1980s  and  early  1990s  (see  Income  Distribution,  ch.  2). 


161 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

These  informal  workers  included  some  900,000  street  vendors 
in  forty-five  cities,  with  annual  sales  of  about  US$13  billion. 
The  growth  of  the  informal  sector  both  reduced  the  state's  tax 
revenue  receipts  and  encouraged  corruption  among  local  offi- 
cials. 

Historically,  real  wages  in  Mexico  have  been  subject  to  tacit 
understandings  among  government  officials,  the  private  sector, 
and  labor  union  chiefs.  During  the  1940s  and  1950s,  these  sec- 
tors forged  an  understanding  whereby  Central  Bank  and  Trea- 
sury Ministry  technocrats  would  control  macroeconomic 
policy,  business  groups  would  refrain  from  open  political  oppo- 
sition while  gaining  political  access  through  officially  recog- 
nized private-sector  associations,  and  labor  leaders  would 
restrict  real  wage  demands  in  exchange  for  additional  patron- 
age for  distribution  to  workers.  After  falling  sharply  during  the 
1940s,  real  wages  began  to  recover  in  the  mid-1950s  and  con- 
tinued to  rise  until  the  late  1970s,  when  the  government 
responded  to  growing  fiscal  pressures  by  shifting  resources 
away  from  the  peasantry  and  the  public  sector.  The  govern- 
ment used  its  control  of  employment  opportunities  and  the 
labor  union  movement  to  hold  down  wages  throughout  the 
1980s  in  an  effort  to  reduce  inflation. 

The  average  real  wage  in  Mexico  remained  low  in  1995,  both 
in  historical  and  international  terms  (see  Income  Distribution, 
ch.  2).  The  Confederation  of  Mexican  Workers  (Confedera- 
tion de  Trabajadores  Mexicanos — CTM)  noted  that  the  aver- 
age worker's  purchasing  power  in  1993  was  only  65  percent  of 
its  1982  level. 

Unemployment  rose  sharply  during  the  six  months  follow- 
ing the  December  1994  new  peso  devaluation,  then  receded 
somewhat  between  August  and  December  1995.  Open  unem- 
ployment (according  to  the  government's  narrow  definition) 
dropped  from  8  percent  to  5  percent  during  this  period, 
although  it  subsequently  increased  to  an  average  of  6  percent 
during  the  first  quarter  of  1996. 

Although  the  government  increased  the  minimum  wage  by 
21  percent  during  1995,  the  cost  of  living  rose  by  more  than  50 
percent  as  a  result  of  the  currency  collapse.  In  September 
1995,  the  minimum  wage  was  sufficient  to  cover  only  35  per- 
cent of  workers'  basic  necessities,  compared  to  94  percent  in 
December  1987.  The  government's  anti-inflation  APRE  pro- 
gram called  for  the  minimum  wage  to  increase  in  line  with  pro- 
jected inflation  of  21  percent.  The  government  also  pledged  to

boost  employment  through  fiscal  incentives  to  encourage  pri- 
vate investment  and  tax  credits  for  companies  that  increased 
their  workforce  above  the  average  level  for  the  first  three  quar- 
ters of  1995.  It  also  planned  to  expand  public  training  pro- 
grams for  workers  and  to  maintain  its  temporary  public  works 
programs  (such  as  rural  road  conservation,  which  was 
expected  to  employ  140,000  people,  as  well  as  other  temporary 
work  programs  that  would  employ  700,000). 

Partially  to  increase  Mexico's  domestic  savings,  the  govern- 
ment proposed  legislation  in  November  1995  to  reform  the 
country's  pension  system  by  allowing  the  creation  of  individual 
accounts  managed  by  private  financial  institutions  rather  than 
by  the  government's  Mexican  Institute  of  Social  Security  (Insti- 
tuto  Mexicano  de  Seguro  Social— IMSS).  Until  1992  the  IMSS 
had  been  solely  responsible  for  managing  the  pension  system. 

Labor  Legislation 

Mexico's  first  comprehensive  labor  law  was  promulgated  in 
1931.  The  Federal  Labor  Act  of  1970  authorizes  the  govern- 
ment to  regulate  all  labor  contracts  and  work  conditions, 
including  minimum  wages,  work  hours,  holidays,  paid  vaca- 


168 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

tions,  employment  of  women  and  minors,  collective  bargaining 
and  strikes,  occupational  hazards,  and  profit  sharing.  The  act 
sets  the  minimum  employment  age  for  children  at  fourteen 
years.  Children  fifteen  years  old  can  work  but  are  restricted 
from  certain  jobs  and  have  special  legal  protections  and 
shorter  working  hours  than  adults.  Medium  and  large  commer- 
cial and  manufacturing  enterprises  generally  observe  child 
labor  laws  strictly,  although  small  shops  and  informal  enter- 
prises often  do  not.  Although  the  law  mandates  a  minimum 
wage,  noncompliance  ranges  from  30  percent  to  50  percent 
among  employers  of  urban  workers  and  reaches  80  percent  in 
the  countryside.  Industrial  safety  laws  often  are  loosely 
observed  in  practice,  especially  in  the  heavy  industry  and  con- 
struction sectors. 

The  maximum  legal  workweek  is  forty-eight  hours,  and  the 
maximum  workday  is  eight  hours.  Industrial  workers  generally 
work  the  maximum  number  of  hours  per  week,  whereas  office 
workers  typically  work  forty  or  forty-four  hours.  The  maximum 
workweek  consists  of  either  six  eight-hour  day  shifts,  six  seven- 
hour  night  shifts,  or  six  seven-and-a-half  hour  mixed  shifts. 
Employers  are  required  to  pay  double-time  for  overtime  of  up 
to  three  hours  per  day,  and  they  cannot  require  workers  to 
work  overtime  more  than  three  times  in  one  week.  Each 
employee  has  the  right  to  one  free  day  per  week,  five  paid  holi- 
days every  year,  and  six  to  eight  days  of  vacation  during  each 
full  year  of  employment.  Workers  also  are  entitled  to  a  share  of 
their  employers'  annual  profits. 

Labor  Unions 

More  than  90  percent  of  production  workers  in  industrial 
enterprises  employing  more  than  twenty-five  workers  belong  to 
labor  unions.  Relatively  few  craft  or  professional  workers  are 
organized.  Because  almost  half  of  all  Mexican  workers  were 
either  unemployed  or  underemployed  and  therefore  not 
organizable,  Mexico  ranked  in  the  early  1990s  as  a  country  with 
a  highly  organized  labor  force.  The  plant  or  workplace  union  is 
the  basic  unit  of  Mexican  labor  organization.  Local  units  (sec- 
ciones)  are  federated  either  into  national  unions  (sindicatos)  or 
local,  regional  (intrastate),  or  state  federations.  Occasionally 
these  federations  join  in  nationwide  confederations.  The  CTM 
is  the  country's  largest  labor  organization.  Its  secretary  general 
in  1994  was  the  long-serving  Fidel  Velasquez.  The  CTM 
women's  affiliate  is  the  Workers'  Federation  of  Women's  Orga-

nizations  (Federacion  Obrera  de  Organizaciones  Femininas). 
Other  prominent  union  federations  include  the  Regional  Con- 
federation of  Mexican  Workers  (Confederacion  Regional  de 
Obreros  Mexicanos),  the  Revolutionary  Confederation  of  Mex- 
ican Workers  and  Peasants  (Confederacion  Revolucionaria  de 
Obreros  y  Campesinos),  the  National  Federation  of  Indepen- 
dent Unions  (Federacion  Nacional  de  Sindicatos  Independien- 
tes),  and  the  Federation  of  Unions  of  Workers  in  the  Service  of 
the  State  (Federacion  de  Sindicatos  de  Trabajadores  al  Servicio 
del  Estado).  Most  of  these  federations  are  affiliated  with  the 
Congress  of  Labor  (Congreso  del  Trabajo),  which  represents 
85  percent  of  all  unionized  workers. 

Most  Mexican  labor  unions  have  strong  ties  to  the  PRI.  In 
the  1930s  and  1940s,  organized  labor  became  an  integral  com- 
ponent of  the  regime.  The  official  unions  facilitated  Mexico's 
dramatic  postwar  economic  growth  by  accepting  labor  wage 
increases  that  did  not  exceed  productivity  gains,  thus  eliminat- 
ing a  major  source  of  inflation.  The  unions  also  discouraged 
industrial  conflict,  which  helped  to  foster  a  receptive  climate 
for  foreign  investment.  Unions  close  to  the  PRI — especially  the 
CTM — used  both  coercion  and  bribery  to  restrain  wage 
demands.  The  absence  of  meaningful  union  democracy  made 
it  hard  for  the  union  rank  and  file  to  press  independently  for 
wage  increases.  During  the  1970s,  an  increasing  number  of  mil- 
itant union  movements  broke  away  from  the  control  of  tradi- 
tional union  bosses,  winning  considerable  autonomy  over 
hiring  and  firing  decisions,  internal  labor  market  operations, 
line  speeds,  and  other  working  conditions.  The  government's 
efforts  during  the  1980s  to  promote  greater  productivity  and 
efficiency  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  led  to  the 
reversal  of  many  of  these  gains.  Industrial  reorganizations  and 
downsizing  resulted  in  massive  layoffs  and  numerous  labor  con- 
cessions to  management  regarding  work  practices. 

President  Salinas  further  weakened  the  traditional  unions 
during  his  incumbency.  In  some  cases,  he  forced  unions  to 
negotiate  at  the  plant  level  rather  than  nationwide.  Shortly 
after  taking  office,  he  weakened  the  official  oil  workers'  union 
by  having  its  powerful  and  corrupt  chief,  Joaquin  Hernandez 
Galicia,  arrested  on  corruption  and  murder  charges.  Salinas 
also  undercut  the  800,000-member  official  public  schoolteach- 
ers' union,  the  National  Union  of  Education  Workers  (Sindi- 
cato  Nacional  de  Trabajadores  de  la  Educacion),  by 
transferring  authority  over  education  from  the  central  govern- 


165 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


ment  to  the  states.  By  doing  so,  he  restricted  the  union's  power 
by  forcing  it  to  negotiate  separate  contracts  with  each  state  gov- 
ernment. The  central  government's  ongoing  privatization  pro- 
gram eliminated  hundreds  of  thousands  of  union  jobs,  and  its 
1993  decision  to  link  future  wage  increases  to  productivity 
gains  denied  the  CTM  the  role  of  bargaining  with  the  govern- 
ment on  wage  increases  for  all  workers.  Instead,  the  CTM  was 
limited  to  advising  individual  union  locals  as  they  negotiated 
new  contracts  with  plant  operators. 

Financial  System 

Banking  System 

Mexico  has  one  of  Latin  America's  most  developed  banking 
systems,  consisting  of  a  central  bank  and  six  types  of  banking 
institutions:  public  development  banks,  public  credit  institu- 
tions, private  commercial  banks,  private  investment  banks,  sav- 
ings and  loan  associations,  and  mortgage  banks.  Other 
components  of  the  financial  system  include  securities  market 
institutions,  development  trust  funds,  insurance  companies, 
credit  unions,  factoring  companies,  mutual  funds,  and  bonded 
warehouses. 

The  central  bank,  the  Bank  of  Mexico  (Banco  de  Mexico), 
regulates  the  money  supply  and  foreign  exchange  markets,  sets 
reserve  requirements  for  Mexican  banks,  and  enforces  credit 
controls.  It  serves  as  the  fiscal  agent  of  the  federal  government, 
the  issuing  bank  for  the  new  peso,  and  a  discount  house  for  pri- 
vate deposit  banks.  It  supervises  the  private  banking  sector 
through  the  National  Banking  Commission,  and  it  provides 
funds  for  government  development  programs.  Legislation  in 
1984  required  the  Bank  of  Mexico  to  limit  its  lending  to  the 
government  to  an  amount  fixed  at  the  beginning  of  each  year. 
To  ensure  continued  control  of  inflation,  the  central  bank  was 
made  autonomous  in  April  1994. 

Mexico  has  a  number  of  other  official  banks  for  agriculture, 
foreign  trade,  cooperatives,  public  works,  housing,  transporta- 
tion, and  the  sugar  industry,  among  other  specialized  pur- 
poses. The  most  important  such  development  institution  is  the 
Nafinsa,  which  provides  financial  support  for  Mexico's  industri- 
alization program.  Nafinsa  provides  medium-term  financing 
and  equity  capital  for  productive  enterprises,  promotes  Mexi- 
can investment  companies,  oversees  the  stock  market  and  the 
issuance  of  public  securities,  and  serves  as  the  legal  depository 


166 


Bank  of  Mexico  headquarters,  Mexico  City

of  government  securities.  By  1993  Nafinsa  had  divested  itself  of 
some  of  its  interests,  but  it  remained  under  state  ownership. 
Mexico's  other  most  important  state  development  bank  is  the 
National  Bank  of  Public  Works  and  Services  (Banco  Nacional 
de  Obras  y  Servicios  Publicos). 

The  private  banking  sector  consists  of  more  than  200  banks, 
which  together  have  more  than  2,500  branches.  The  prolifera- 
tion of  banking  institutions  resulted  from  regulations  that  pro- 
hibited any  single  bank  from  combining  more  than  two 
banking  functions.  Mexico's  two  largest  private  banks  are  the 
Bank  of  Commerce  (Banco  de  Comercio — Bancomer),  com- 
prising thirty-five  affiliated  banks  with  more  than  500  branches, 
and  the  National  Bank  of  Mexico  (Banco  Nacional  de 
Mexico — Banamex) .  Development  banks,  known  as  financieras 
and  organized  by  commercial  banks  in  association  with  major 
industrial  enterprises,  provide  most  of  the  private  sector's 
development  financing. 

In  an  effort  to  stem  massive  capital  flight,  President  Lopez 
Portillo  decreed  the  nationalization  of  the  country's  private 
banks  in  September  1982.  In  August  1983,  the  government 
authorized  the  return  of  up  to  34  percent  of  the  equity  shares 


167 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

in  these  banks  to  the  private  sector,  and  it  eliminated  eleven 
banks  and  merged  fifty  others  into  twenty-nine  national  credit 
institutions  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  banking  system's  effi- 
ciency. In  March  1985,  the  government  announced  a  further 
reduction  in  the  number  of  commercial  banks,  from  twenty- 
nine  to  eighteen. 

The  government  took  its  first  actual  step  toward  reprivatiz- 
ing  the  commercial  banks  in  1987,  when  it  returned  34  percent 
of  their  capital  to  private  investors  in  the  form  of  nonvoting 
stock.  In  1990  it  allowed  the  sale  to  foreign  investors  of  34  per- 
cent of  nonvoting  shares  in  state-owned  commercial  banks. 
Reprivatization  began  in  earnest  in  June  1991.  By  July  1992,  all 
eighteen  commercial  banks  had  been  sold  to  private  owners, 
yielding  more  than  US$12  billion.  The  privatization  program 
dramatically  increased  the  number  of  investors  holding  stock 
in  Mexican  commercial  banks  from  just  8,000  on  the  eve  of  the 
1982  nationalization  to  80,000  in  January  1993. 

To  improve  the  availability  of  credit,  the  government 
allowed  the  establishment  of  new  domestic  banks  in  Mexico  in 
1993,  and  the  following  year  it  allowed  United  States  and  Cana- 
dian banks  to  begin  operating  in  Mexico.  At  the  end  of  1994, 
there  were  some  fifty  commercial  banks  in  operation  in 
Mexico,  up  from  nineteen  at  the  end  of  1992.  Mexico  had 
forty-five  brokerage  houses,  fifty-nine  insurance  companies, 
seventy-four  leasing  companies,  sixty-five  factoring  houses,  and 
forty-nine  exchange  houses. 

Following  the  currency  crisis  of  late  1994,  the  government 
was  forced  to  raise  interest  rates  sharply  in  order  to  protect  the 
new  peso  by  retaining  existing  short-term  foreign  investment 
and  attracting  new  capital  inflows.  High  interest  rates  during 
1995  sharply  increased  the  payments  owed  by  Mexican  individ- 
ual and  business  borrowers,  many  of  whom  could  not  shoulder 
the  increased  burden.  As  a  result,  the  share  of  nonperforming 
to  performing  loans  held  by  Mexican  banks  rose  significantly, 
creating  a  major  crisis  for  the  financial  sector.  During  the  first 
three  quarters  of  1995,  the  ratio  of  bad  debts  to  the  banking 
system's  total  loan  portfolio  increased  from  8  percent  to  17  per- 
cent. Partially  as  a  result,  the  rate  of  growth  in  commercial 
bank  financing  of  private-sector  activities  declined  to  just  1  per- 
cent during  this  period,  compared  with  19  percent  a  year  ear- 
lier. 

The  interest  rate  increase  also  raised  the  cost  to  banks  and 
the  government  of  the  various  efforts  to  resolve  the  problem  of 


168 


The  Economy 


banks'  nonperforming  loans.  In  late  1994,  the  government 
took  over  Banca  Cremi,  and  a  year  later  it  was  forced  to  take 
control  of  Inverlat.  The  government  also  agreed  to  assume 
problem  loans  held  by  Banamex  and  Bancomer. 

In  the  wake  of  the  financial  sector  crisis,  the  government 
introduced  in  mid-1995  a  program  for  rescheduling  bank  loans 
using  index-linked  investment  units.  In  September  1995,  the 
government  unveiled  another  emergency  program  of  aid  for 
bank  debtors,  which  was  to  provide  relief  for  8  million  bank 
debtors.  By  February  1996,  83  percent  of  eligible  loans  had 
been  restructured  under  this  program.  By  mid-1996,  the  cost  of 
the  government's  various  efforts  to  prevent  a  banking  system 
collapse  was  estimated  at  91  billion  new  pesos.  The  govern- 
ment held  control  of  25  percent  of  bank  assets,  despite  having 
privatized  the  banking  system  only  four  years  earlier.  The  gov- 
ernment's efforts  to  restore  the  financial  sector's  stability  were 
rewarded  by  a  sharp  drop  in  interest  rates  in  late  1995  and  early 
1996. 

Stock  Exchange 

Shortly  after  taking  office,  President  de  la  Madrid  allowed 
the  establishment  of  private  brokerage  houses  with  wide  lati- 
tude to  conduct  financial  transactions  in  domestic  capital  mar- 
kets. That  action  laid  the  foundation  for  the  first  significant 
stock  market  in  Mexican  history,  the  Mexican  Stock  Exchange 
(Bolsa  Mexicana  de  Valores — BMV).  Following  several  years  of 
dynamic  growth,  the  BMV's  leading  index  fell  sharply  as  a 
result  of  the  October  1987  United  States  stock  market  crash. 
The  BMV  recovered  slowly  in  1988,  then  surged  ahead  from 
1989  through  1991.  By  the  early  1990s,  the  BMV  had  become 
one  of  the  world's  fastest  growing  stock  exchanges.  During 
1991  the  index  of  traded  stocks  rose  128  percent  in  new  peso 
terms  and  118  percent  in  United  States  dollar  terms.  Analysts 
attributed  the  stock  market's  buoyancy  to  increased  confidence 
in  the  economy  and  to  expectations  of  lower  interest  rates  and 
approval  of  NAFTA. 

In  1992,  199  companies  were  listed  as  trading  on  the  stock 
exchange.  A  total  of  11  trillion  new  pesos  were  traded,  and  the 
exchange  had  a  total  capitalization  of  US$139  billion  and  a 
price-to-ear nings  ratio  of  more  than  thirteen.  The  total  value  of 
stocks  traded  increased  by  US$191  billion  between  1987  and 
1993.  Treasury  bills,  bank  acceptances,  and  commercial  paper 
were  the  most  common  instruments  traded.  At  the  end  of 


169 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

1993,  Mexican  investors  held  about  75  percent  of  the  equities 
traded.  Although  the  value  of  Mexican-owned  stocks  rose  by 
about  US$143  billion  between  1987  and  1993,  only  0.2  percent 
of  all  Mexicans  had  brokerage  accounts  at  the  end  of  1992. 

The  BMV's  market  value  stood  at  about  US$200  billion  at 
the  end  of  1993.  Analysts  attributed  the  rise  partly  to  expecta- 
tions of  higher  profits  resulting  from  a  1  percentage  point 
reduction  in  the  corporate  tax  rate,  lower  energy  prices  for 
industrial  users,  and  euphoria  over  the  passage  of  NAFTA. 
Despite  a  setback  induced  by  the  January  1994  Zapatista  rebel- 
lion in  the  state  of  Chiapas,  the  BMV  continued  its  strong 
growth  in  early  1994.  Beginning  in  March,  however,  the  market 
was  buffeted  by  a  series  of  political  shocks — including  two  high- 
profile  political  assassinations,  revelations  of  high-level  corrup- 
tion in  President  Salinas's  entourage,  and  continued  unrest  in 
Chiapas — that  contributed  to  its  high  volatility  throughout  the 
rest  of  the  year. 

The  stock  market  was  further  buffeted  by  the  collapse  of  the 
new  peso  in  early  1995,  causing  the  stock  index  to  fall  to  less 
than  1,500  points  in  February  of  that  year.  The  main  stock 
index  gradually  recovered  to  just  under  3,000  points  by  the  end 
of  1995  and  had  reached  3,300  by  September  1996.  Mexican 
stocks  gained  24  percent  in  dollar  terms  during  the  first  eight 
months  of  1996.  Mexico's  stock  market  had  a  US$70  billion 
capitalization  in  September  1996,  according  to  Morgan  Stanley 
Capital  International  indices. 

Exchange  Rate 

From  December  1982  until  November  1991,  the  Mexican 
peso  had  two  rates  of  exchange  against  the  United  States  dol- 
lar— the  controlled  or  "official  rate"  and  the  "free  rate."  The 
controlled  rate  applied  to  income  from  most  merchandise 
exports,  to  funds  used  by  maquiladora  (see  Glossary)  assembly 
industries  for  local  expenditure  other  than  fixed  assets,  to 
nearly  all  import  payments,  and  to  principal  and  interest  pay- 
ments and  other  credit  expenses.  The  free  rate  applied  to  most 
other  transactions,  such  as  tourism  and  profit  remittances. 

In  November  1991,  the  government  eliminated  all  exchange 
controls,  thereby  unifying  the  various  peso  exchange  rates.  The 
regime  freed  the  peso  to  float  within  a  band,  the  bottom  of 
which  was  fixed  at  3,051  pesos  per  dollar  and  the  top  of  which 
was  devalued  by  0.2  pesos  per  day.  Renewed  pressure  on  the 
peso  forced  the  authorities  in  October  1992  to  raise  the  aver- 


170 


The  Economy 


age  daily  depreciation  to  0.4  pesos  per  dollar,  increasing  the 
peso's  annual  rate  of  devaluation  to  less  than  5  percent.  The 
peso  continued  to  appreciate  in  real  terms,  however,  because 
Mexico's  inflation  rate  exceeded  that  of  the  United  States  by 
some  8  percentage  points.  The  government  was  reluctant  to 
devalue  the  peso  to  the  full  extent  of  the  inflation  differential 
with  the  United  States  because  it  feared  that  a  large  devalua- 
tion would  exacerbate  domestic  inflation  and  undermine  pub- 
lic  confidence  in  the  stability  of  the  government's 
macroeconomic  policy.  It  preferred  to  compensate  for  the  less 
competitive  position  of  the  peso  by  increasing  productivity 
within  Mexico.  In  January  1993,  the  government  introduced 
the  new  peso,  worth  1,000  of  the  old  and  divided  into  100  cen- 
tavos,  to  simplify  foreign  exchange. 

Intense  international  demand  for  Mexican  stocks  and  high- 
yielding  two-year  treasury  certificates,  known  as  cetes,  kept  the 
new  peso  at  a  stable  level  of  3.1  new  pesos  per  dollar  for  most  of 
1993.  Uncertainty  about  NAFTA's  passage  drove  the  new  peso 
down  to  3.3  per  dollar  in  November  1993,  although  it  soon  ral- 
lied to  3.1  per  dollar  as  interest  rates  rose  and  NAFTA's  pros- 
pects of  ratification  appeared  to  improve.  By  late  1993,  the 
capital  influx  had  overvalued  the  new  peso  against  the  dollar 
by  some  30  percent,  leading  some  investors  to  avoid  Mexican 
currency  for  fear  that  the  new  peso's  overvaluation  would  com- 
pel the  government  to  impose  a  large  devaluation  that  would 
sharply  reduce  the  dollar  return  of  cetes.  Some  leading  private- 
sector  figures  favored  devaluation,  expecting  it  to  help  reduce 
the  trade  deficit,  Mexico's  need  for  foreign  capital,  and  thus 
interest  rates. 

Political  considerations  deterred  the  government  from 
imposing  a  devaluation  that  would  lower  living  standards,  jeop- 
ardize investor  confidence,  and  promote  capital  flight  in  the 
months  prior  to  the  August  1994  presidential  and  congres- 
sional elections.  The  slowdown  of  capital  inflows  exerted  steady 
downward  pressure  on  the  new  peso  throughout  the  year.  By 
late  1994,  the  government  was  drawing  heavily  on  international 
reserves  to  prop  up  the  new  peso. 

The  almost  complete  disappearance  of  Mexico's  reserves 
forced  the  new  Zedillo  government  to  bolster  the  currency's 
value.  On  December  20,  1994,  the  government  raised  the  ceil- 
ing on  the  exchange  rate  band  from  3.4  to  4.1  new  pesos  per 
dollar.  However,  continued  pressure  on  the  new  peso,  com- 
bined with  mounting  investor  concern  about  the  government's 


171 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

intentions,  forced  the  administration  two  days  later  to  let  the 
currency  float.  The  new  peso  ended  1994  at  5.3  per  dollar.  It 
continued  to  weaken  during  early  1995,  as  investors  doubted 
the  government's  ability  to  repay  the  US$29  billion  in  short- 
term  tesebono  debt  that  would  fall  due  during  that  year.  In  1995 
the  exchange  rate  fell  to  6.5  new  pesos  per  dollar,  and  in  Janu- 
ary 1996  it  stood  at  7.4  new  pesos  per  dollar. 

The  average  monthly  interest  rate  on  twenty-eight-day  cetes 
rose  from  14  percent  in  1995  to  49  percent  in  1996.  When  the 
new  peso  came  under  heavy  speculative  pressure  in  late  1995, 
Mexico's  monetary  authorities  reacted  by  raising  interest  rates 
sharply.  Mindful  of  the  need  to  restore  investor  confidence  in 
Mexico's  early  economic  recovery,  the  authorities  allowed 
interest  rates  to  fall  at  the  end  of  1995. 

Agriculture 

Although  nearly  half  of  Mexico's  total  land  area  is  officially 
classified  as  agricultural,  only  12  percent  of  the  total  area  is  cul- 
tivated. In  the  early  1990s,  only  some  24  million  hectares  of  a 
possible  32  million  hectares  were  under  cultivation. 

Extensive  irrigation  projects  carried  out  in  the  1940s  and 
1950s  greatly  expanded  Mexico's  cropland,  especially  in  the 
north.  The  government  created  areas  of  intensive  irrigated 
agriculture  by  constructing  storage  dams  across  the  valleys  of 
the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte  (Rio  Grande)  and  the  rivers  flowing 
down  from  the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental,  by  controlling  the 
lower  Rio  Colorado  (Colorado  River),  and  by  tapping  subterra- 
nean aquifers. 

These  water-control  projects  allowed  Mexico  to  expand  rap- 
idly its  total  land  area  under  cultivation.  Between  1950  and 
1965,  the  total  area  of  irrigated  land  in  Mexico  more  than  dou- 
bled, from  1.5  million  hectares  to  3.5  million  hectares.  Despite 
a  slowdown  in  the  development  of  irrigated  land  after  1965, 
the  total  irrigated  area  had  expanded  to  more  than  6  million 
hectares  by  1987.  In  the  early  1990s,  80  percent  of  Mexico's  cul- 
tivated land  required  regular  irrigation.  Because  of  the  high 
cost  of  irrigation,  however,  the  government  has  emphasized 
expanding  production  on  existing  farmland  rather  than 
expanding  the  area  under  irrigation. 

Agricultural  practices  in  Mexico  range  from  traditional  tech- 
niques, such  as  the  slash-and-burn  cultivation  of  indigenous 
plants  for  family  subsistence,  to  the  use  of  advanced  technology 
and  marketing  expertise  in  large-scale,  capital-intensive  export 


172 


The  Economy 


agriculture.  Government  extension  programs  have  fostered  the 
wider  use  of  machinery,  fertilizers,  and  soil  conservation  tech- 
niques. Although  corn  is  grown  on  almost  half  of  Mexico's 
cropland,  the  country  became  a  net  importer  of  grain  during 
the  1970s. 

Land  Tenure 

During  the  first  decade  of  the  twentieth  century,  peasants 
began  to  agitate  for  the  return  of  communal  and  private  lands 
seized  by  large-scale  commercial  producers  since  the  1870s. 
The  desire  to  recover  lost  lands  motivated  many  peasants  to 
join  the  Revolution  that  began  in  1910.  On  January  6,  1915, 
General  Venustiano  Carranza  began  the  agrarian  reform  pro- 
cess by  decreeing  the  immediate  return  to  their  original  own- 
ers of  all  communal  lands  improperly  seized  since  1856. 
Carranza,  who  became  president  in  1917,  also  decreed  that 
previously  landless  villages  receive  title  to  lands  expropriated 
from  private  hacienda  owners  or  to  excess  government  land. 
These  principles  were  later  incorporated  into  Article  27  of  the 
constitution  of  1917. 

The  constitution  established  three  different  forms  of  land 
tenure  in  Mexico:  private,  public,  and  social.  Social  property 
was  further  subdivided  into  communal  (in  southern  Mexico) 
and  ejido  (see  Glossary)  lands.  Private  lands  were  worked  by 
owners,  sharecroppers,  and  landless  peasants;  social  lands  were 
worked  by  colonos  (settlers)  or  members  of  ejidos,  known  as  eji- 
datarios.  Although  the  constitution  limited  private  holdings  to 
100  hectares,  by  the  early  1990s  Mexico  had  more  than  40,000 
farms  of  101  hectares  or  larger  and  some  500  farms  larger  than 
50,000  hectares.  The  constitution  prescribed  national  sover- 
eignty over  all  land,  water,  and  subsoil  mineral  resources  within 
national  boundaries.  It  held  private  ownership  of  land  to  be  a 
privilege  rather  than  an  absolute  right,  and  it  allowed  the  state 
to  expropriate  lands  that  it  judged  not  to  serve  a  useful  social 
purpose  (see  Rural  Society,  ch.  2). 

Article  27  and  subsequent  legislation  established  the  ejido,  or 
communal  landholding,  as  the  primary  form  of  land  tenure  in 
Mexico  (see  Rural  Society,  ch.  2).  Mexico's  most  extensive  land 
redistribution  took  place  during  the  presidency  of  Lazaro 
Cardenas  (1934-40).  Cardenas  redistributed  some  18  million 
hectares,  twice  as  much  as  all  his  predecessors  combined.  By 
1940  most  of  the  country's  arable  land  had  been  redistributed 
to  peasant  farmers,  and  approximately  one-third  of  all  Mexi- 


173 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


cans  had  benefited  from  the  agrarian  reform  program  (see 
Cardenas  and  the  Revolution  Rekindled,  1934-40,  ch.  1). 

Agrarian  reform  sharply  increased  the  proportion  of 
Mexico's  arable  land  held  by  minifundistas  (smallholders).  The 
share  of  total  crop  land  held  by  large  estates  fell  from  70  per- 
cent in  1923  to  29  percent  by  1960,  while  that  held  by  small 
farms  of  fewer  than  five  hectares  rose  from  7  percent  in  1930  to 
more  than  33  percent  by  the  1980s.  Between  1924  and  1984, 
the  government  expropriated  and  redistributed  more  than  77 
million  hectares  of  large-estate  land,  amounting  to  more  than 
one-third  of  the  national  territory. 

Declining  agricultural  production  and  mounting  food 
imports  moved  President  Salinas  finally  to  address  the  root 
cause  of  the  problem,  the  land  tenure  system.  In  1991  Salinas 
announced  a  constitutional  reform  of  the  ejido  and  land  distri- 
bution systems  intended  to  overcome  the  low  productivity 
resulting  from  the  fragmentation  of  ejido  farming  units,  of 
which  58  percent  contained  five  hectares  or  fewer.  A  reform  of 
land  tenure  rules  in  February  1992  gave  Mexico's  3  million  eji- 
datarios  formal  title  to  their  land,  enabling  them  to  lease  or  sell 
their  plots  if  a  majority  of  members  of  their  ejido  agreed.  No 
further  land  would  be  distributed,  and  joint  ventures  with  pri- 
vate capital  were  legalized  and  encouraged.  The  reforms 
sought  to  reverse  the  trend  toward  smaller  and  less  productive 
farming  units  and  stimulate  rural  investment  by  allowing  ejida- 
tanos  to  use  their  holdings  as  collateral  for  raising  capital. 
Implementation  was  hampered,  however,  by  delays  in  conduct- 
ing the  necessary  land  surveys  of  ejidos  prior  to  transfer  of  title, 
as  well  as  by  other  factors. 

Government  Agricultural  Policy 

In  the  years  after  World  War  II,  Mexico  followed  a  relatively 
moderate  import-substitution  policy.  By  striking  a  relative  bal- 
ance between  industrialization  and  growth  of  agricultural  out- 
put, the  government  was  able  to  maintain  a  steady  rate  of 
agricultural  output  and  exports  and  to  restrict  its  external  bor- 
rowing requirements  for  many  years. 

In  an  effort  to  resolve  Mexico's  long-standing  conflict 
between  promoting  agricultural  production  for  export  and  for 
domestic  consumption,  the  government  followed  a  dual  strat- 
egy between  1940  and  1965;  it  promoted  large-scale  commer- 
cial agriculture  while  redistributing  land  to  the  rural  poor. 
Government  policy  favored  large  producers  because  export 


174 


175 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


agriculture  provided  foreign  exchange  needed  to  finance 
industrialization.  Extensive  public  investment  in  irrigation 
projects  primarily  benefited  northern  areas,  where  large  pri- 
vate farms  were  concentrated,  while  rain-fed  subsistence  farm- 
ing predominated  in  the  central,  southwest,  and  lower  Gulf  of 
Mexico  regions.  Larger  farms  produced  for  the  lucrative 
export  and  agro-industrial  markets,  while  traditional  farmers 
grew  the  less  profitable  staple  crops.  The  government  sold 
basic  food  crops  through  its  National  Company  for  People's 
Sustenance  (Compama  Nacional  de  Susistencias  Populares — 
Conasupo)  retail  outlets,  maintaining  low  purchase  prices  in 
order  to  maintain  domestic  political  stability  and  justify  low 
urban  wages.  Until  the  1970s,  Mexico  was  largely  self-sufficient 
in  basic  staple  crops. 

Partly  in  response  to  changing  market  conditions,  the  pro- 
duction of  staple  commodities  stagnated  and  then  declined 
after  1965,  while  production  of  feed  crops,  livestock,  and 
export  products  expanded.  The  agriculture  sector's  problems 
resulted  partly  from  reduced  public  investment,  as  the  govern- 
ment shifted  resources  to  urban  areas  and  failed  to  collect  suffi- 
cient tax  revenue.  The  government  responded  to  declining 
staple  output  in  1971  with  new  agrarian  reform  legislation 
intended  both  to  encourage  production  and  to  increase  rural 
employment.  The  law  authorized  ejidos  to  move  beyond  basic 
crop  cultivation  into  mining,  forestry,  fishing,  agro-industry, 
commerce,  and  tourism. 

Despite  such  measures,  agricultural  output  failed  to  grow  by 
more  than  2  percent  during  the  1970s  even  though  domestic 
food  demand  steadily  increased  as  a  result  of  population 
growth,  growth  in  personal  income  resulting  from  the  oil 
boom,  and  the  government's  provision  of  consumer  subsidies 
for  basic  foods  in  order  to  improve  the  nutrition  of  the  poor. 
The  government  raised  producer  prices  and  began  to  increase 
public  spending  in  support  of  rain-fed  production  by  small  pro- 
ducers. Supply  failed  to  keep  pace  with  demand,  however,  and 
by  1980  Mexico  had  become  a  net  food  importer. 

In  1980  President  Lopez  Portillo  signaled  a  new  emphasis  on 
production  of  staple  crops  for  domestic  consumption  over 
export-oriented  agriculture  by  establishing  the  Mexican  Food 
System  (Sistema  Alimentario  Mexicano — SAM)  (see  Rural 
Society,  ch.  2) .  This  program  sought  to  build  a  strong  produc- 
tive base  for  Mexican  agriculture  in  order  to  reduce  the  coun- 
try's dependence  on  food  imports  from  the  United  States  and 


176 


The  Economy 


restore  self-sufficiency  in  basic  staples.  Its  main  beneficiaries 
included  landless  peasants  and  small  farmers,  mainly  in  rain- 
fed  areas.  Additionally,  the  program  provided  subsidized  "bas- 
kets" of  basic  foods  to  some  19  million  undernourished  Mexi- 
cans. Production  priorities  and  goals  were  set  for  each  region: 
wheat  would  be  grown  in  the  north,  corn  in  the  southeast  high- 
lands, rice  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  region,  and  beans  through- 
out. Conasupo's  retail  outlets  would  distribute  the  food.  As  a 
result  of  the  debt  crisis,  the  de  la  Madrid  administration  abol- 
ished SAM  in  1982. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  Mexican  government  began  to  empha- 
size reform  and  modernization  of  the  agricultural  sector  (see 
table  8,  Appendix).  President  Salinas  moved  to  reduce  credit 
costs,  root  out  corruption  and  inefficiency  in  agricultural  insti- 
tutions, and  raise  guaranteed  prices  for  certain  products.  The 
government's  increased  investment  in  agriculture  and  its  1991 
reform  of  the  land  tenure  system  helped  to  attract  substantial 
new  private  investment  to  agriculture  between  1990  and  1994. 

Building  upon  its  1991  land  reform  measures,  the  Salinas 
administration  announced  in  October  1993  the  details  of  a  new 
agricultural  income  support  plan,  the  Program  of  Direct  Rural 
Support  or  Procampo.  Starting  with  the  1994  growing  season, 
Procampo  replaced  current  price  supports  for  basic  grains  with 
direct  cash  payments  of  12  billion  new  pesos  (US$3.5  billion), 
representing  an  83  percent  increase  over  supports  paid  in 
1993.  About  70  percent  of  Mexico's  cultivated  land  was  subsi- 
dized. The  program  was  initially  funded  from  the  fiscal  surplus 
that  had  accumulated  since  the  late  1980s. 

Procampo  was  intended  to  improve  agricultural  planning 
decisions  and  promote  capitalization  of  the  rural  sector.  It 
marked  the  abandonment  of  Mexico's  traditional  policy  of 
agricultural  self-sufficiency  in  favor  of  a  more  market-oriented 
system  in  which  individual  producers  rather  than  government 
bureaucrats  would  make  basic  production  decisions.  The  pro- 
gram also  sought  to  offset  producer  subsidies  in  other  coun- 
tries, reduce  domestic  commodity  prices  to  levels  consistent 
with  world  market  prices,  encourage  crop  diversification  and 
conservation,  boost  the  competitiveness  of  the  domestic  food 
processing  sector,  and  encourage  the  modernization  of 
Mexico's  agricultural  production  and  marketing  channels. 

Initial  beneficiaries  of  Procampo  included  3.3  million  grow- 
ers of  corn,  beans,  sorghum,  wheat,  rice,  soybeans,  and  cotton, 
which  together  accounted  for  70  percent  of  Mexico's  arable

land.  Barley  and  safflower  producers  were  added  to  the  pro- 
gram in  autumn  1994.  The  new  subsidies  were  based  on  the 
size  and  productivity  of  land  holdings  and  were  paid  to  both 
commercial  and  subsistence  growers.  The  government  claimed 
that  the  new  program  would  cover  some  2.5  million  farmers 
who  had  not  benefited  from  the  previous  price  support  system. 
The  800,000  farmers  who  did  benefit  from  that  system  received 
both  the  price  subsidies  and  the  new  Procampo  subsidy  for  an 
eighteen-month  transitional  period. 

In  addition  to  price  supports,  growers  of  program  crops 
received  in  the  spring  and  summer  of  1994  a  general  support 
payment  of  330  new  pesos  per  hectare,  which  rose  to  350  new 
pesos  per  hectare  in  the  fall  and  winter  of  1994.  Starting  in 
April  1995,  the  Procampo  support  payments  were  gradually 
reduced  in  order  to  bring  food  prices  into  line  with  market 
conditions.  Meanwhile,  direct  payments  under  the  program 
increased,  although  at  a  slower  rate  than  the  decline  in  price 
supports.  Total  support  to  agricultural  producers  fluctuated 
between  a  minimum  level  ensuring  adequate  income  for  sub- 
sistence farmers  and  a  maximum  level  that  would  guarantee 
profitability  for  commercial  producers. 

Funding  for  Procampo  was  expected  to  remain  steady  for 
ten  years,  until  2003,  and  then  decline  over  an  additional  five 
years  until  the  program's  termination  in  2008.  Procampo's  fif- 
teen-year duration  was  intended  to  give  farmers  adequate  time 
to  adopt  new  technologies,  develop  producer  associations  with 
other  farmers  or  private  agribusiness  firms,  and  rationalize 
land  use.  To  encourage  alternative  crop  production,  Procampo 
would  continue  to  provide  area  support  payments  to  growers 
who  decided  to  change  from  program  crops  to  alternative 
crops  or  livestock,  forestry,  ecological,  and  aquaculture  activi- 
ties throughout  the  fifteen-year  phase-out  period. 

Procampo's  reform  of  agricultural  prices  was  expected  to 
encourage  a  shift  away  from  production  of  corn  and  dry  beans 
and  toward  wheat,  soybeans,  and  other  products  such  as  fruits 
and  vegetables.  Its  impact  was  likely  to  be  greatest  in  northwest- 
ern and  northeastern  Mexico  and  the  Bajio  region  of  west-cen- 
tral Mexico,  where  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  many 
growers  had  switched  from  production  of  rice,  cotton,  sor- 
ghum, oilseeds,  and  wheat  to  the  more  profitable  corn  and  dry 
beans.  The  direct  payments  were  also  expected  to  slow  rural 
migration  to  cities  and  provide  needed  capital  to  impoverished 
subsistence  farmers.  Some  government  critics  alleged  that  Pro-

campo  was  intended  to  generate  rural  support  for  the  ruling 
PRI. 

During  1995  the  government  introduced  a  new  agricultural 
support  program,  the  Alliance  for  the  Countryside  (Alianza 
para  el  Campo),  as  an  adjunct  to  its  APRE  program  with  labor 
and  business.  The  alliance  program  presaged  the  devolution  of 
responsibility  for  agricultural  support  to  state  governments, 
and  it  reinforced  Procampo  by  expanding  from  ten  to  fifteen 
years  the  period  during  which  direct  cash  subsidies  would  be 
paid  to  producers  of  various  basic  food  crops.  The  new  pro- 
gram also  sought  to  improve  credit  flows  to  farmers  from  Ban- 
rural  and  other  state  agencies. 

Grain  Production 

Corn  is  the  staple  food  of  most  Mexicans  and  is  grown  on 
about  one-third  of  the  country's  cultivated  land.  Central  Mex- 
ico is  the  main  area  of  corn  cultivation.  The  size  of  the  corn 
harvest  varies  significantly  with  weather  conditions.  In  the 
1992-93  growing  season,  about  8  million  hectares  were  planted 
in  corn,  and  16.5  million  tons  were  harvested,  a  slight  increase 
over  the  previous  year's  output  of  16.3  million  tons.  In  1994  the 
corn  harvest  amounted  to  19.2  million  tons. 

Until  the  late  1980s,  Mexico  enjoyed  corn  self-sufficiency 
during  years  when  the  harvest  was  good.  In  1990,  however, 
demand  exceeded  supply  by  some  3.3  million  tons  and  was  met 
by  imports.  Thereafter,  Mexico's  import  needs  steadily  fell  to 
1.9  million  tons,  at  a  cost  of  US$178  million  in  1991  and  1.1 
million  tons  in  1992.  In  1993  Mexico  imported  just  400,000 
tons  of  corn,  almost  all  from  the  United  States. 

Wheat  became  more  widely  cultivated  than  it  had  been 
before,  as  bread  replaced  corn  tortillas  among  Mexican  con- 
sumers. There  is  little  correlation  between  poor  harvests  of 
wheat  and  corn  because  each  has  different  climatic  require- 
ments. The  total  area  sown  in  wheat  declined  from  1.1  million 
hectares  in  1986  to  714,000  hectares  in  1993.  Mexico's  wheat 
output  averaged  slightly  more  than  4  million  tons  annually  dur- 
ing the  1980s,  fluctuating  from  3.2  million  tons  in  1981,  to  3.7 
million  tons  in  1988,  and  to  4.4  million  in  1989.  Wheat  produc- 
tion fell  slightly  from  3.7  million  tons  in  1992  to  3.6  million 
tons  in  1994.  For  most  of  the  1980s,  domestic  wheat  output  was 
barely  sufficient  to  satisfy  internal  demand.  Mexico's  wheat 
import  requirement  steadily  grew  from  260,000  tons  (at  a  cost 
of  US$46  million)  in  1990  to  1.4  million  tons  in  1993.

The  Economy 


Because  the  climatic  requirements  of  sorghum  are  similar  to 
those  of  corn,  its  output  has  undergone  similar  weather-based 
fluctuations.  Mexico's  sorghum  production  declined  from  5.4 
million  tons  in  1992  to  3.9  million  tons  in  1994.  The  land  area 
sown  in  sorghum  declined  by  more  than  half  between  1989 
and  1993,  from  1.3  million  hectares  to  600,000  hectares. 
Mexico's  import  requirements  for  sorghum  (almost  all  from 
the  United  States)  consequently  rose  between  the  mid-1980s 
and  early  1990s.  Mexico  imported  3.0  million  tons  of  sorghum 
(at  a  cost  of  US$362  million)  in  both  1990  and  1991.  Its  import 
needs  rose  further  to  5.0  million  tons  in  1992,  then  declined  to 
2.8  million  tons  in  1993. 

The  total  land  area  sown  in  rice  decreased  from  192,000  hec- 
tares in  1986  to  50,000  hectares  in  1993.  Mexico's  domestic  out- 
put of  milled  rice  fell  steadily  from  615,000  tons  in  1986  to 
312,000  tons  in  1989.  After  rising  slightly  to  431,000  tons  in 
1990,  rice  output  fell  again  to  246,000  tons  in  1992,  then  recov- 
ered to  371,000  tons  in  1993.  Mexico  imported  substantial 
quantities  of  rice  from  the  late  1980s  through  the  early  1990s. 
In  1993  the  country  imported  350,000  tons  of  rice. 

Beans  are  a  basic  staple  food  for  most  poor  Mexicans. 
Mexico's  domestic  production  of  dry  beans  fell  from  1.4  mil- 
lion tons  in  1991  to  719,000  tons  in  1992,  then  recovered  to  1.5 
million  tons  in  1994.  In  1991  Mexico  imported  125,000  tons  of 
beans.  The  1991  bean  harvest  covered  1.9  million  hectares,  the 
largest  area  sown  in  beans  since  the  early  1980s. 

Mexico's  barley  output  fell  steadily  from  581,000  tons  in 
1991  to  325,000  tons  in  1994.  About  450,000  hectares  were 
sown  in  barley  in  1993.  Annual  production  of  oats  remained 
steady  throughout  the  early  1990s  at  100,000  tons,  and  some 
100,000  hectares  were  sown  in  oats  each  year. 

Fresh  Fruits  and  Vegetables 

Fruit  and  vegetable  production  is  concentrated  in  Mexico's 
irrigated  northeast  region  and  directed  mainly  to  the  United 
States  winter  market.  In  1991  fruit  and  vegetable  exports 
earned  some  US$935  million,  40  percent  of  Mexico's  total 
export  revenue.  Fresh  fruit  and  vegetables  accounted  for  more 
of  Mexico's  agricultural  export  revenue  than  did  coffee  by  the 
early  1990s.  Processed  food  exports  grew  at  an  average  annual 
rate  of  nearly  13  percent  in  the  early  1990s. 

Mexico  produced  2.7  million  tons  of  oranges  in  1993,  fol- 
lowed by  apples  (580,000  tons),  table  grapes  (270,000  tons), 


181 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

tangerines  (185,000  tons),  grapefruit  (118,000  tons),  pears 
(32,000  tons),  and  raisins  (13,000  tons).  It  also  produced  con- 
siderable quantities  of  bananas,  mangoes,  lemons,  limes,  water- 
melons, peaches,  nectarines,  plums,  avocados,  pineapples,  and 
strawberries. 

Mexico's  output  of  fresh  tomatoes  declined  from  1.7  million 
tons  in  1990  to  1.4  million  tons  in  1993.  During  the  same 
period,the  total  area  harvested  in  tomatoes  fell  from  74,200 
hectares  to  58,500  hectares. 

Other  Crops 

Between  1990  and  1993,  Mexico's  soybean  output  fluctuated 
with  the  amount  of  land  sown.  For  the  1992-93  growing  sea- 
son, 313,000  hectares  were  sown  in  soybeans,  producing 
578,000  tons.  Mexico's  soybean  imports  generally  exceeded 
domestic  production  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  in  some 
years  by  a  wide  margin.  The  country  imported  2.1  million  tons 
of  soybeans  in  1992  and  1993,  mainly  from  the  United  States. 
In  1991  Mexico  imported  US$348  million  worth  of  soybeans. 

Between  1989  and  1993,  Mexico's  cottonseed  output  fell 
from  617,000  tons  to  75,000  tons,  and  its  total  area  harvested 
fell  from  255,000  hectares  to  42,000  hectares.  In  1993  Mexico 
imported  180,000  tons  of  cottonseed.  Peanut  output  averaged 
104,000  tons  between  1988  and  1992;  the  1993  harvest  of 
80,000  hectares  produced  108,000  tons  of  peanuts.  Mexico  pro- 
duced 195,000  tons  of  copra  and  10,000  tons  of  sunflower  seed 
in  1993.  Mexico  also  produced  green  chilies,  green  beans,  and 
green  peas. 

Mexico's  raw  sugar  industry  was  reorganized  and  modern- 
ized during  the  early  1980s.  As  a  result,  raw  sugar  production 
reached  40  million  tons  in  the  1985-86  growing  season, 
exceeding  the  1982-83  harvest  by  50  percent.  Sugar  output 
declined  thereafter  because  of  trade  liberalization,  price  con- 
trols, and  high  credit  costs.  Bad  weather  in  late  1989  and 
uncertainties  resulting  from  privatization  of  state  sugar  mills 
also  depressed  production.  Sugar  output  fell  from  42  million 
tons  in  1988  to  35  million  tons  in  1990,  then  recovered  slightly 
to  40  million  tons  (from  530,000  hectares  of  sugarcane)  in 
1993.  Declining  domestic  production  forced  Mexico  to  import 
large  amounts  of  sugar  to  satisfy  domestic  demand.  In  1991  it 
imported  1.3  million  tons  of  sugar.  Mexico's  sugar  harvest  in 
1994-95  was  4.3  million  tons,  and  the  following  year's  harvest 
was  expected  to  rise  to  4.4  million  tons.

The  Economy 


Coffee  was  introduced  into  Mexico  during  the  nineteenth 
century.  Mexican  coffee  is  mainly  the  arabica  type,  which  grows 
particularly  well  in  the  Pacific  coastal  region  of  Soconusco, 
near  the  Guatemalan  border.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  southern 
state  of  Chiapas  was  Mexico's  most  important  coffee-growing 
area,  producing  some  45  percent  of  the  annual  crop  of 
275,000  tons.  More  than  2  million  Mexicans  grew  coffee,  most 
barely  subsisting.  Seventy-five  percent  of  Mexico's  coffee  grow- 
ers worked  plots  of  fewer  than  two  hectares.  These  small  culti- 
vators produced  about  30  percent  of  the  country's  annual 
harvest;  larger  and  more  efficient  farms  produced  the  rest. 

During  the  1980s,  coffee  became  Mexico's  most  valuable 
export  crop.  In  1985  coffee  growers  produced  4.9  million  sixty- 
kilogram  bags,  and  coffee  exports  earned  US$882  million  at 
the  unusually  high  world  price  of  US$0.90  per  kilogram. 
Thereafter  output  fluctuated  between  5.6  million  bags  and  4.4 
million  bags.  As  international  coffee  prices  rose  further,  the 
government  in  1988  encouraged  coffee  growers,  especially  in 
Chiapas,  to  increase  output  and  expand  the  area  under  cultiva- 
tion. It  tried  to  increase  production  by  offering  easy  credit  to 
coffee  growers  and  by  converting  forested  land  into  ejidos  for 
cultivation  by  poor  coffee  growers. 

International  coffee  prices  fell  50  percent  between  1989  and 
1993.  Lower  prices  combined  with  the  elimination  of  coffee 
subsidies  to  reduce  the  income  of  coffee  growers  by  an  esti- 
mated 65  percent.  Lower  prices  reduced  Mexico's  export 
income  from  coffee  to  about  US$370  million  by  1991.  They 
also  depressed  coffee  production,  which  fell  from  5.2  million 
bags  in  1992  to  4.1  million  bags  in  1993. 

Although  cotton  had  lost  its  traditional  overwhelming  domi- 
nance of  the  export  market  by  the  1990s,  it  remained — along 
with  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables — a  major  cash  crop  of  Mexico's 
irrigated  lands.  Cotton  output  fell  from  some  1.8  million  bales 
in  1973  to  1.4  million  bales  in  1989,  and  to  800,000  bales  in 
1990.  The  cotton  industry's  poor  performance  in  the  late  1980s 
and  early  1990s  resulted  mainly  from  bad  weather,  low  world 
prices,  and  depressed  domestic  demand  resulting  from  slow 
growth  in  Mexico's  textile  industry.  In  1992  the  total  area  sown 
in  cotton  was  42,000  hectares,  down  sharply  from  250,000  hect- 
ares in  1991.  Mexico's  cotton  output  in  1993  was  just  over 
30,000  tons,  down  from  nearly  181,000  tons  in  1992.  Export 
revenue  from  cotton  fell  from  US$113  million  in  1988  to 
US$77  million  in  1991.  By  1995-96,  Mexico's  cotton  crop  had 


183 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


recovered  to  193  million  tons,  and  the  1996-97  harvest  was 
forecast  at  266  million  tons. 

Mexico's  cocoa  production  declined  from  57,000  tons  in 
1988  to  43,500  tons  in  1993.  The  total  area  harvested  in 
tobacco  rose  from  18,700  hectares  in  1992  to  34,000  hectares  in 
1993,  while  the  total  farm  sales  weight  of  tobacco  fell  from 
38,250  tons  in  1992  to  29,800  tons  in  1993.  Tobacco  exports 
earned  some  US$44  million  in  1991. 

Livestock 

In  the  early  1990s,  one-third  of  Mexican  territory  was  offi- 
cially designated  as  grazing  land.  These  lands  were  located 
mainly  in  the  north,  where  Herefords  and  other  breeds  were 
raised  on  huge  cattle  ranches  for  export  to  the  United  States, 
and  in  the  southern,  central,  and  southeastern  states,  where 
native  beef  cattle  were  raised.  During  the  1980s,  higher  domes- 
tic food  demand  encouraged  more  intensive  raising  of 
improved  cattle  breeds  near  urban  areas  for  both  dairy  prod- 
ucts and  beef.  In  1992  the  Mexican  government  announced 
new  measures  to  assist  the  meat  industry,  including  deregula- 
tion of  cattle  growers  and  tighter  controls  on  imported  meat. 
The  needs  of  the  livestock  industry  also  have  encouraged  more 
extensive  cultivation  of  fodder  crops  on  irrigated  lands. 

Mexico's  livestock  industry  accounted  for  some  30  percent 
of  the  agriculture  sector's  annual  growth,  although  animal  hus- 
bandry contributed  less  than  1  percent  to  total  GDP.  The 
industry's  weak  performance  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s 
resulted  from  inadequate  investment  (which  obstructed  the 
adoption  of  intensive  production  techniques),  high  feed  costs, 
low  prices  fixed  by  the  government,  poor  weather  conditions, 
epidemics  of  hoof-and-mouth  disease,  and  fears  of  expropria- 
tion. Weak  productivity  has  forced  Mexico  to  become  a  net 
importer  of  beef. 

Mexico's  total  cattle  stock  rose  slightly  from  30  million  head 
in  1992  to  31  million  head  in  1993,  and  the  total  swine  stock 
rose  from  10  million  head  to  11  million  head.  The  number  of 
sheep  held  steady  at  13  million  head.  Production  of  beef  and 
veal  was  1.7  million  tons  in  1993.  Although  lower  domestic 
demand  for  red  meat  caused  a  0.5  percent  decline  in  total  live- 
stock output  in  1991,  beef  exports  held  steady  and  earned 
US$358  million  in  1991,  compared  with  US$349  million  in 
1990.  Output  of  lamb,  mutton,  and  goat  meat  was  138,000  tons 
in  1993,  and  swine  meat  production  was  870,000  tons.

Mexico's  total  flock  of  chickens  rose  from  282  million  in 
1992  to  285  million  in  1993,  while  poultry  meat  output  fell 
from  936,000  tons  in  1992  to  923,000  tons  in  1993.  Mexico's 
chicken  flock  produced  20  billion  eggs  in  1993. 

Forestry 

Some  9  percent  of  Mexico's  territory  consists  of  forest  or 
woodland,  59  percent  of  which  is  in  the  tropics,  15  percent  in 
the  subtropical  zone,  and  26  percent  in  the  temperate  and  cool 
zones.  Forests  cover  some  49  million  hectares,  almost  one-third 
of  which  are  open  to  logging,  mainly  in  the  states  of  Chihua- 
hua, Durango,  and  Michoacan.  About  9  percent  of  forests  are 
on  state  or  federal  lands,  19  percent  on  ejido  lands,  and  72  per- 
cent on  municipal  or  private  lands.  Although  the  tropical  trees 
of  the  southwest  rain  forests  are  the  most  numerous,  the  conif- 
erous pine  forests  of  the  temperate  and  cool  regions  are  com- 
mercially more  important,  providing  pulpwood  for  processing 
in  Mexico's  paper  mills.  More  than  65  percent  of  Mexico's  for- 
ests consist  of  hardwoods,  and  the  rest  are  softwoods.  The 
major  timber  stands  are  mahogany,  cedar,  primavera  (white 
mahogany),  sapote,  oak,  copa  (yaya),  and  pine.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

In  1992  forestry  provided  6  percent  of  total  agricultural  out- 
put but  a  negligible  1  percent  of  overall  GDP.  Lumber  produc- 
tion declined  by  5  percent  in  1990  and  by  3  percent  in  1991. 
Lumber  companies  attributed  lower  output  to  more  intense 
foreign  competition  as  a  result  of  trade  liberalization.  Exports 
of  wood  products  were  valued  at  US$14  million  in  1988. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  forestry  sector  suffered  from  over  ex- 
ploitation, insufficient  investment  and  planning,  and  the  disap- 
pearance of  certain  species,  as  well  as  from  forest  fires  and 
insect  damage  (see  Environmental  Conditions,  ch.  2) .  Defores- 
tation resulted  in  the  loss  of  some  370,000  hectares  annually  as 
land  was  cleared  for  cultivation  and  livestock  grazing. 

Fishing 

Mexico  has  some  11,500  kilometers  of  Pacific,  Gulf  of 
Mexico,  and  Caribbean  coastline,  and  its  inland  waters  cover 
more  than  2.9  million  hectares.  The  country's  coastal  fishing 
grounds  offer  a  rich  variety  of  fish  and  other  seafood.  The 
Pacific  coast  has  thirty-one  ports  and  produces  nearly  three- 
quarters  of  Mexico's  total  catch;  the  states  of  Sonora  and 
Sinaloa  alone  account  for  40  percent  of  the  total  catch. 
Mexico's  Pacific  fishing  grounds  produce  mainly  lobster, 
shrimp,  croaker,  albacore,  skipjack,  and  anchovies,  while  its 
Gulf  of  Mexico  and  Caribbean  waters  produce  shrimp,  jewfish, 
croaker,  snapper,  mackerel,  snook,  and  mullet.  The  Gulf  of 
Mexico  is  an  especially  important  source  of  shrimp.  Certain 
species — such  as  shrimp,  lobster,  abalone,  clam,  croaker,  grou- 
per, and  sea  turtle — are  reserved  for  the  country's  more  than 
284  fishing  cooperatives,  which  together  have  more  than 
39,000  members.  The  state-owned  Mexican  Fisheries 
(Pesqueros  Mexicanos)  markets  about  15  percent  of  the  total 
catch.  In  1989  the  fishing  subsector  employed  288,000  people. 
The  total  fishing  fleet  grew  from  48,000  boats  in  1984  to  74,000 
boats  in  1989. 

Until  about  1970,  the  relative  distance  of  urban  markets 
from  the  coasts  depressed  commercial  production  of  seafood. 
During  the  1970s  and  1980s,  the  government  fostered  the  con- 
struction of  new  plants  for  freezing  and  processing  fish.  The 
national  catch  more  than  doubled  after  cooperatives  were 
organized.  The  government's  US$5  billion  expansion  program 
helped  the  fishing  industry  to  increase  output  by  more  than  30 
percent  between  1985  and  1990.  Despite  these  efforts,  however, 
Mexico's  catch  accounted  for  less  than  10  percent  of  the  total 


186 


The  Economy 


catch  taken  from  waters  off  Mexico's  coasts  by  United  States, 
Canadian,  and  Japanese  boats. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Mexico's  fishing  output  averaged  a  disap- 
pointing 1.4  million  tons  per  year,  equivalent  to  just  0.3  per- 
cent of  GDP.  Production  increased  from  1.1  million  tons  in 
1983  to  1.6  million  tons  in  1990.  Output  fell  slightly  in  1991  as 
the  United  States  and  Europe  embargoed  Mexican  tuna 
because  of  concerns  about  inadequate  protection  of  dolphins. 
The  Salinas  administration's  National  Fishing  Plan  for  1990-94 
promised  higher  public  investment  in  the  fishing  industry, 
despite  the  government's  stated  intention  to  sell  Mexican  Fish- 
eries to  private  owners. 

In  1992  Mexico  produced  251,500  tons  of  California  pil- 
chard (sardine),  down  from  more  than  600,000  tons  in  1991. 
The  yellowfin  tuna  catch  rose  from  116,400  tons  in  1991  to 
122,200  tons  in  1992.  Mexico  produced  3,400  tons  of  Califor- 
nian  anchoveta  in  1992,  down  from  12,100  tons  in  1991.  Out- 
put of  marine  shrimp  and  prawns  declined  from  70,600  tons  in 
1991  to  66,200  tons  in  1992.  Mexico  exported  two-thirds  of  its 
catch,  especially  frozen  shrimp,  prawns,  and  other  shellfish 
from  the  Gulf  of  California  and  Bahia  de  Campeche,  mainly  to 
the  United  States.  Export  earnings  amounted  to  US$389  mil- 
lion in  1989.  In  1992  Mexico  produced  77,000  tons  of  cichlids 
and  88,100  tons  of  other  freshwater  fish. 

Industry 

Manufacturing 

In  the  early  1950s,  the  manufacturing  sector  eclipsed  agri- 
culture as  the  largest  contributor  to  Mexico's  overall  GDP. 
Largely  because  of  extensive  import  substitution,  manufactur- 
ing output  expanded  rapidly  from  the  1950s  through  the  1970s 
to  satisfy  rising  domestic  demand.  The  value  added  by  manu- 
facturing rose  from  20  percent  of  GDP  in  1960  to  24  percent  in 
1970,  and  again  to  25  percent  by  1980.  Manufacturing  output 
grew  at  an  annual  average  of  9  percent  during  the  1960s,  and 
by  a  slightly  lower  annual  rate  of  7  percent  in  the  1970s. 

This  forty-year  trend  of  manufacturing  growth  abruptly 
stopped  and  then  reversed  itself  during  the  early  1980s.  Sharp 
reductions  in  both  exports  and  internal  demand  caused  manu- 
facturing output  to  fall  by  10  percent  between  1981  and  1983. 
After  recovering  briefly  in  1985,  manufacturing  output  fell 
again  by  6  percent  the  following  year.  Production  of  consumer 


187 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

durables  suffered  especially,  with  the  domestic  electrical  goods 
and  consumer  electronics  goods  sectors  losing  between  20  per- 
cent and  25  percent  of  their  markets  during  the  mid-1980s. 
Government  industrial  policies  began  to  favor  manufactured 
goods  destined  for  the  export  market,  in  particular  machinery 
and  electrical  equipment,  automobiles  and  auto  parts,  basic 
chemicals,  and  food  products  (especially  canned  vegetables 
and  fruit). 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  manufacturing  sector  began  to  recover. 
In  1988  manufacturing  output  grew  by  a  modest  4  percent. 
After  expanding  a  robust  7  percent  in  1989,  manufacturing 
output  steadily  slowed;  it  grew  by  only  2  percent  in  1992,  as  a 
result  of  weak  export  growth  and  falling  domestic  demand. 
After  contracting  by  2  percent  in  1993,  manufacturing  output 
expanded  by  4  percent  in  1994.  The  most  dynamic  manufac- 
turing subsectors  in  1994  were  metal  products,  machinery,  and 
equipment  (9  percent  growth),  followed  by  basic  metals  indus- 
tries (9  percent  growth).  In  1994  the  manufacturing  sector 
accounted  for  20  percent  of  the  country's  total  GDP  and 
employed  about  20  percent  of  all  Mexican  workers. 

Mexico's  export  base  for  manufactured  goods  is  narrow,  with 
three  subsectors  (vehicles,  chemicals,  and  machinery  and 
equipment)  accounting  for  more  than  two-thirds  of  non-maqui- 
ladora  foreign  earnings.  The  value  of  Mexico's  imports  of  man- 
ufactured goods  rose  sharply  following  trade  liberalization, 
from  US$11  billion  in  1987  to  US$48  billion  in  1992  (US$62 
billion  including  maquiladora  imports).  Increased  foreign  com- 
petition has  seriously  threatened  many  Mexican  manufactur- 
ing enterprises,  almost  all  of  which  are  small  and  medium-sized 
companies  employing  fewer  than  250  workers.  In  1991  Mexico 
had  137,200  manufacturing  enterprises,  some  90  percent  of 
which  employed  no  more  than  twenty  workers. 

The  principal  industrial  centers  of  Mexico  include  the 
Mexico  City  metropolitan  area  (which  includes  the  Federal  Dis- 
trict), Monterrey,  and  Guadalajara.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  capi- 
tal area  alone  accounted  for  about  half  of  the  country's 
manufacturing  activity,  nearly  half  of  all  manufacturing 
employment,  and  almost  one-third  of  all  manufacturing  enter- 
prises. About  one-third  of  formal-sector  workers  in  the  capital 
area  were  engaged  in  manufacturing.  Manufacturers  have  been 
drawn  to  greater  Mexico  City  because  of  its  large  and  highly 
skilled  work  force,  large  consumer  market,  low  distribution 
costs  and  proximity  to  government  decision  makers  and  the 


188 


The  Economy 


nation's  communications  system.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  chemi- 
cal, textile,  and  food  processing  industries  accounted  for  half 
of  all  manufacturing  activity  in  the  Federal  District,  and  metal 
fabrication  accounted  for  another  one-quarter.  Heavy  industry 
(including  paper  mills,  electrical  machinery  plants,  and  basic 
chemical  and  cement  enterprises)  tended  to  locate  in  the  sub- 
urbs of  Mexico  City,  where  planning  and  environmental  restric- 
tions were  less  rigorous. 

By  the  late  1980s,  more  than  two-thirds  of  all  foreign  invest- 
ment in  Mexico  was  concentrated  in  maquiladora  zones  near 
the  United  States  border.  In  1965  the  government  began  to 
encourage  the  establishment  of  maquiladora  plants  in  border 
areas  to  take  advantage  of  a  United  States  customs  regulation 
that  limited  the  duty  on  imported  goods  assembled  abroad 
from  United  States  components  to  the  value  added  in  the  man- 
ufacturing process.  The  maquiladora  zones  offered  foreign 
investors  both  proximity  to  the  United  States  market  and  low 
labor  costs.  Most  maquiladora  plants  were  established  in  or  near 
the  twelve  main  cities  along  Mexico's  northern  border.  Some  of 
these  enterprises  had  counterpart  plants  just  across  the  United 
States  border,  while  others  drew  components  from  the  United 
States  interior  or  from  other  countries  for  assembly  in  Mexico 
and  then  reexport. 

The  maquiladora  sector  grew  nearly  30  percent  annually 
between  1988  and  1993.  By  the  latter  year,  more  than  2,000 
maquiladora  businesses  were  in  operation,  employing  505,000 
workers.  These  plants  generated  US$4.8  billion  in  value  added 
during  1992.  Their  main  activities  included  the  assembly  of 
automobiles,  electrical  goods,  electronics,  furniture,  chemicals, 
and  textiles.  To  increase  their  purchase  of  domestic  materials, 
the  Mexican  government  decided  in  December  1989  to 
exempt  local  sales  to  maquiladoras  from  the  value-added  tax 
and  to  let  these  enterprises  sell  up  to  half  of  their  output  on 
the  domestic  market.  Nevertheless,  almost  all  in-bond  products 
have  been  exported  to  the  United  States. 

In  1994  food  processing,  beverages,  and  tobacco  products 
constituted  the  leading  manufacturing  sector  in  terms  of  value, 
accounting  for  about  26  percent  of  total  manufacturing  output 
and  employing  17  percent  of  manufacturing  workers.  Food, 
beverage,  and  tobacco  output  expanded  by  an  annual  average 
of  3  percent  between  1990  and  1994,  largely  as  a  result  of 
export  growth.  In  1994  it  expanded  by  less  than  1  percent.  In 
the  early  1980s,  well  over  50  percent  of  Mexico's  productive 


189 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

units  were  involved  in  food  processing,  and  Mexico's  beer 
industry  was  the  world's  eighth  largest. 

Metal  products,  machinery,  and  transportation  equipment 
accounted  for  24  percent  of  manufacturing  GNP  in  1994.  The 
automobile  subsector  was  among  the  most  dynamic  manufac- 
turing sectors  in  the  early  1990s  and  led  among  manufacturing 
exporters.  Mexico's  automobile  manufacturers  were  led  by 
Volkswagen,  General  Motors  (GM),  Ford,  Nissan,  and  Chrysler. 
Ford  expanded  production  by  33  percent  during  1991, 
Chrysler  by  17  percent,  and  GM  by  10  percent.  Volkswagen 
controlled  25  to  30  percent  of  the  domestic  automobile  mar- 
ket, and  Nissan  another  15  to  20  percent.  Mexican  automobile 
exports  earned  US$6.1  billion  in  1992,  not  counting  maquila- 
dora  production,  which  earned  an  additional  US$1.3  billion. 
Export  revenue  from  passenger  vehicle  sales  rose  by  21  percent 
in  1993  and  by  22  percent  in  1994,  while  domestic  sales  fell  by 
some  14  percent  in  1993  and  rose  by  less  than  1  percent  in 
1994. 

In  1983  the  government  encouraged  the  automobile  indus- 
try to  shift  from  import  substitution  to  export  production.  It 
lowered  national  content  requirements  for  exporters  and 
required  assemblers  to  balance  imports  of  auto  parts  with  an 
equivalent  value  of  automobile  exports.  In  1990  the  govern- 
ment eliminated  restrictions  on  the  number  of  production 
lines  that  automobile  producers  could  maintain  and  allowed 
producers  to  import  finished  automobiles  (although  they  were 
required  to  earn  US$2.50  in  automobile  exports  for  every 
US$1  spent  on  imports). 

In  the  early  1980s,  automobile  exports  increased  as  domestic 
demand  fell.  Export  growth  leveled  off  in  the  early  1990s  as  the 
domestic  market  recovered.  Growth  of  total  vehicle  output 
slowed  from  21  percent  in  1991  to  9  percent  in  1992.  In  1994 
vehicle  production  totaled  more  than  1  million  units,  of  which 
850,000  were  cars.  Production  fell  by  16  percent  between  Janu- 
ary and  November  1995.  During  those  months,  exports  rose  by 
37  percent  to  700,000  units,  while  domestic  sales  fell  by  70  per- 
cent, to  140,000  units. 

Textiles,  clothing,  and  footwear  together  accounted  for  9 
percent  of  manufacturing  output  in  1994  and  employed  about 
7  percent  of  all  manufacturing  workers.  Textile  and  clothing 
production  stagnated  throughout  the  1980s  because  of  low 
domestic  demand,  high  labor  costs,  antiquated  and  inefficient 
technology,  more  competitive  export  markets  (especially  in 


190

plant,  Mexico  City

Asia),  and  heavy  import  competition  resulting  from  trade  liber- 
alization. In  the  early  1990s,  the  textile  industry  operated  at 
just  60  percent  of  capacity.  Import  competition  caused  foot- 
wear and  leather  output  to  decline  4  percent  annually  between 
1982  and  1989.  In  1990  domestic  footwear  enterprises  pro- 
duced almost  200,000  pairs  of  shoes  per  week.  In  1992  footwear 
and  leather  goods  accounted  for  4  percent  of  manufacturing 
GDP. 

N on- maquiladora  export  earnings  for  textile,  clothing,  and 
footwear  sales  rose  from  US$499  million  in  1990  to  US$890 
million  in  1992.  Imports  also  rose  sharply  to  almost  US$2  bil- 
lion in  1992.  The  sector  showed  signs  of  strong  recovery  in  late 

1993,  following  its  forced  modernization. 

The  chemicals  sector  (including  oil  products,  rubber,  and 
plastics)  accounted  for  18  percent  of  manufacturing  GDP  in 

1994.  Its  output  increased  by  5  percent  during  1994.  In  1990 
this  sector  employed  130,000  workers.  Although  the  chemical 
industry  was  the  most  important  foreign-exchange  earner  in 
the  manufacturing  sector,  its  output  fell  far  short  of  domestic 
demand.  Exports  of  non- maquiladora  chemicals  and  petro- 
chemicals earned  US$2.5  billion  in  1992,  but  the  country 
imported  US$5.8  billion  worth  of  chemicals  and  petrochemi- 
cals. The  imbalance  resulted  partly  from  domestic  price  con- 


191 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


trols,  inadequate  patent  protection,  and  high  research  and 
development  costs.  Chemicals  and  petrochemicals  accounted 
for  72  percent  of  total  non- maquiladora  export  revenues  in 

1992.  The  chemical  industry  slumped  in  early  1993,  as  sales  fell 
by  10  percent,  operating  profits  by  61  percent,  and  net  profits 
by  59  percent. 

Petrochemicals  accounted  for  less  than  2  percent  of  overall 
GDP  in  1992.  The  state  oil  monopoly,  Mexican  Petroleum 
(Petroleos  Mexicanos — Pemex),  dominated  the  country's 
more  than  200  petrochemical  companies,  which  together  oper- 
ated more  than  700  plants.  The  petrochemical  subsector 
enjoyed  robust  annual  growth  of  7  percent  between  1982  and 
1988,  but  output  slowed  thereafter.  Pemex  produced  18.5  mil- 
lion tons  of  petrochemicals  in  1993,  down  from  19  million  tons 
in  1992.  In  1992  the  Salinas  government  reduced  the  number 
of  basic  petrochemicals  reserved  for  Pemex  to  just  eight  and 
lifted  restrictions  on  foreign  investment  in  "secondary"  petro- 
chemicals to  improve  the  oil  company's  cost-effectiveness,  raise 
the  industry's  productivity,  and  attract  new  private  investment. 

Although  Mexico's  pharmaceutical  industry  consisted  of 
some  450  companies,  the  largest  ten  enterprises  accounted  for 
30  percent  of  all  sales  in  1993.  In  the  early  1990s,  some  fifty-six 
firms  controlled  three-quarters  of  pharmaceutical  production. 
Nonmetallic  minerals  (excluding  oil)  accounted  for  7  percent 
of  manufacturing  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary) 
in  1994.  The  subsector  concentrated  on  production  of  cement, 
glass,  pottery,  china,  and  earthenware.  Total  cement  output  in 
1993  was  27  million  tons.  Cement  exports  fell  from  4.5  million 
tons  in  1988  to  1.4  million  tons  in  1992  because  of  higher 
domestic  demand  and  United  States  antidumping  sanctions.  A 
new  cement  plant  came  into  operation  in  Coahuila  in  early 

1993,  and  the  expansion  of  two  other  plants  in  Hidalgo  was 
completed. 

Mexico's  largest  cement  producer  is  the  privately  owned 
Mexican  Cement  (Cementos  Mexicanos — Cemex).  By  1994 
Cemex  had  become  the  world's  fourth  largest  cement  com- 
pany, with  annual  earnings  of  US$3  billion.  In  an  effort  to 
establish  itself  as  a  major  multinational  corporation,  Cemex 
expanded  its  operations  during  the  early  1990s  into  the  United 
States  and  twenty-five  countries  in  Europe,  Asia,  and  Latin 
America. 

The  basic  metals  subsector  (dominated  by  iron  and  steel) 
accounted  for  6  percent  of  manufacturing  GNP  in  1994.  Mex- 

192 


The  Economy 


ico's  iron  and  steel  industry  is  one  of  the  oldest  in  Latin  Amer- 
ica, comprising  ten  large  steel  producers  and  many  smaller 
firms.  The  industry  is  centered  in  Monterrey,  where  the  coun- 
try's first  steel  mills  opened  in  1903.  Steel  plants  in  Monterrey 
(privatized  in  1986)  and  nearby  Monclova  accounted  for  about 
half  of  Mexico's  total  steel  output  in  the  early  1990s.  Most  of 
the  rest  came  from  the  government's  Lazaro  Cardenas-Las  Tru- 
chas  Steel  Plant  (Sicartsa)  and  Altos  Hornos  de  Mexico 
(Ahmsa)  steel  mills,  which  were  sold  to  private  investors  in 
1991. 

Export  revenue  from  steel  and  steel  products  fell  from 
US$1.03  billion  in  1991  to  US$868  million  in  1992.  Spurred  by 
rising  demand  from  the  automobile  industry,  crude  steel  out- 
put rose  6  percent  to  9  million  tons  in  1993.  During  the  first 
half  of  1993,  output  rose  10  percent  over  the  same  period  in 
1992,  to  4  million  tons.  Production  of  semifinished  steel  rose 
86  percent,  reaching  573,000  tons,  and  rolled  steel  production 
expanded  5  percent  to  more  than  2.6  million  tons.  Pipe  pro- 
duction fell  13  percent  to  174,400  tons.  In  1993  Mexico  was 
Latin  America's  second  largest  steel  producer  after  Brazil, 
accounting  for  some  20  percent  of  Latin  America's  total  steel 
production  of  43  million  tons. 

Paper,  printing,  and  publishing  contributed  about  5  percent 
of  manufacturing  output  in  1994.  Mexico  produced  almost  3 
million  tons  of  paper  and  772,000  tons  of  cellulose  in  1990. 
The  country  had  some  760  publishing  enterprises  in  1990,  48 
percent  of  which  published  books,  44  percent  periodicals,  and 
8  percent  both.  These  companies  produced  a  total  of  142  mil- 
lion books  and  693  million  periodicals.  Trade  liberalization 
hurt  the  domestic  publishing  industry  in  1992,  as  imports  rose 
to  US$1.6  billion  from  US$1.3  billion  in  1991.  Exports  of  Mexi- 
can publications  declined  in  value  from  US$232  million  in 
1991  to  US$217  million  in  1992. 

Finally,  wood  products  contributed  3  percent  of  manufactur- 
ing GDP  in  1994.  Although  output  of  wood  products  fell  in  the 
late  1980s  because  of  high  investment  costs  and  other  adverse 
conditions  in  the  primary  forestry  industry,  it  began  to  recover 
in  1993.  Output  of  wood  products  increased  by  2  percent  dur- 
ing 1994. 

Construction 

The  construction  sector  accounted  for  slightly  more  than  5 
percent  of  GDP  in  1994.  In  1991  Mexico  had  about  18,000  reg- 


193 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

istered  construction  companies  that  employed  almost  1  million 
workers.  In  that  year,  heavy  construction  accounted  for  44  per- 
cent of  all  construction,  residential  building  35  percent,  and 
industrial  construction  14  percent.  Government  efforts  to  pro- 
mote private-sector  investment  in  physical  infrastructure 
projects  (especially  road  building  and  new  rental  housing) 
helped  to  increase  construction  growth.  Construction  growth 
slowed  from  7  percent  in  1990  to  2  percent  in  1991.  It  acceler- 
ated to  8  percent  in  1992,  but  slowed  again  to  3  percent  in 
1993,  partially  as  a  result  of  continuing  high  interest  rates, 
which  discouraged  private  investment.  In  1993  transport 
projects  accounted  for  29  percent  of  the  value  of  production  in 
the  formal  construction  sector,  the  installation  of  water  sup- 
plies accounted  for  11  percent,  and  electricity  and  communica- 
tions projects  accounted  for  9  percent. 

Energy  and  Mining 
Petroleum 

Although  explorers  drilled  Mexico's  first  petroleum  well  in 
1869,  oil  was  not  discovered  until  after  the  turn  of  the  twenti- 
eth century.  Commercial  production  of  crude  oil  began  in 
1901.  By  1910  prospectors  had  begun  to  define  the  Panuco- 
Ebano  and  Faja  de  Oro  fields  located  near  the  central  Gulf  of 
Mexico  coast  town  of  Tuxpan,  and  systematic  explorations  by 
foreign  companies  came  to  supersede  the  uncoordinated 
efforts  of  speculative  prospectors.  Mexico  began  to  export  oil 
in  1911. 

Article  27  of  the  constitution  of  1917  gives  the  Mexican  gov- 
ernment a  permanent  and  inalienable  right  to  all  subsoil 
resources.  The  government's  efforts  to  assert  this  right  pro- 
duced a  lengthy  dispute  with  foreign  oil  companies  that  was 
not  resolved  until  the  companies  were  nationalized  in  the  late 
1930s.  The  1923  Bucarelli  Agreements  committed  the  United 
States  and  Mexico  to  regard  titles  held  by  foreign  oil  compa- 
nies as  concessions  by  the  Mexican  government  rather  than  as 
outright  ownership  claims.  In  1925  President  Plutarco  Elias 
Calles  decreed  that  foreign  oil  companies  must  register  their 
titles  in  Mexico  and  limited  their  concessions  to  a  period  of 
fifty  years. 

Despite  disruption  caused  by  the  Revolution,  Mexico's  oil 
production  peaked  in  1921  at  193  million  barrels  (some  25  per- 
cent of  world  production),  largely  as  a  result  of  increased  inter- 


194 


The  Economy 


national  demand  generated  by  World  War  I.  During  much  of 
the  1920s,  Mexico  was  second  only  to  the  United  States  in 
petroleum  output  and  led  the  world  in  oil  exports.  By  the  early 
1930s,  however,  output  had  fallen  to  just  20  percent  of  its  1921 
level  as  a  consequence  of  worldwide  economic  depression,  the 
lack  of  new  oil  discoveries,  increased  taxation,  political  instabil- 
ity, and  Venezuela's  emergence  as  a  more  attractive  source  of 
petroleum.  Production  began  to  recover  with  the  1932  discov- 
ery of  the  Poza  Rica  field  near  Veracruz,  which  became 
Mexico's  main  source  of  petroleum  until  the  late  1950s. 

In  1938  President  Lazaro  Cardenas  nationalized  the  petro- 
leum industry,  giving  the  Mexican  government  a  monopoly  in 
the  exploration,  production,  refining,  and  distribution  of  oil 
and  natural  gas,  and  in  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  basic  pet- 
rochemicals. Although  Cardenas  offered  compensation, 
United  States  oil  companies  pressured  the  United  States  gov- 
ernment to  embargo  all  imports  from  Mexico  in  order  to  dis- 
courage similar  nationalizations  in  other  countries.  The 
boycott  was  in  effect  briefly,  but  the  United  States  government 
soon  pressured  the  oil  companies  to  come  to  terms  with 
Mexico  as  a  result  of  President  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt's  Good 
Neighbor  Policy  and  United  States  security  needs  arising  from 
World  War  II.  In  1943  Mexico  and  the  oil  companies  reached  a 
final  settlement  under  which  the  companies  received  US$24 
million  (a  fraction  of  the  book  value  of  the  expropriated  facili- 
ties) as  compensation.  Nevertheless,  the  oil  nationalization 
deprived  Mexico  of  foreign  capital  and  expertise  for  some 
twenty  years. 

Mexico's  oil  output  expanded  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  6 
percent  between  1938  and  1971.  Production  increased  from  44 
million  barrels  in  1938  to  78  million  barrels  in  1951.  Domestic 
demand  progressively  exceeded  output,  and  in  1957  Mexico 
became  a  net  importer  of  petroleum  products.  Production  rose 
to  177  million  barrels  by  1971  with  the  exploitation  of  new  oil 
fields  in  the  isthmus  of  Tehuantepec  and  natural  gas  reserves 
near  the  northeastern  border  city  of  Reynosa,  but  the  gap 
between  domestic  demand  and  production  continued  to 
widen. 

Extensive  oil  discoveries  in  the  1970s  increased  Mexico's 
domestic  output  and  export  revenues.  In  1972  explorers  dis- 
covered deep  oil  wells  in  the  states  of  Chiapas  and  Campeche 
that  showed  huge  reservoirs  of  petroleum  extending  for  200 
kilometers  northeast  below  the  Bahfa  de  Campeche,  and  possi- 


195 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

bly  in  the  opposite  direction  toward  Guatemala.  Almost  every 
drilling  operation  conducted  after  1972  struck  oil.  In  1973  oil 
production  surpassed  the  peak  of  190  million  barrels  achieved 
in  the  early  1920s.  In  1974  Pemex  announced  additional  petro- 
leum discoveries  in  Veracruz,  Baja  California  Norte,  Chiapas, 
and  Tabasco. 

By  1975  Mexico's  oil  output  once  again  exceeded  internal 
demand,  providing  a  margin  for  export.  President  Lopez  Porti- 
llo  announced  in  1976  that  Mexico's  proven  hydrocarbon 
reserves  had  risen  to  11  billion  barrels.  They  rose  further  to 
72.5  billion  barrels  by  1983.  Lopez  Portillo  decided  to  increase 
domestic  production  and  use  the  value  of  Mexico's  petroleum 
reserves  as  collateral  for  massive  international  loans,  most  of 
which  went  to  Pemex.  Between  1977  and  1980,  the  oil  company 
received  US$12.6  billion  in  international  credit,  representing 
37  percent  of  Mexico's  total  foreign  debt.  It  used  the  money  to 
construct  and  operate  offshore  drilling  platforms,  build 
onshore  processing  facilities,  enlarge  its  refineries,  engage  in 
further  exploration,  prove  fresh  reserves,  and  purchase  capital 
goods  and  technical  expertise  from  abroad.  These  investments 
helped  to  increase  petroleum  output  from  400  million  barrels 
in  1977  to  1.1  billion  barrels  by  1982.  Between  1983  and  1991, 
Mexico's  petroleum  exports  by  volume  remained  roughly  con- 
stant at  1.4  million  barrels  per  day  (bpd),  while  total  produc- 
tion increased  from  2.7  million  bpd  to  3.1  million  bpd. 

The  oil  sector's  share  of  total  export  revenue  fell  sharply 
from  61  percent  in  1985  to  38  percent  in  1990  because  of 
higher  domestic  demand  and  lower  total  output.  The  volume 
of  exports  fell  from  1.4  million  bpd  in  1987  to  1.3  million  bpd 
in  1990.  Oil  prices  rose  briefly  to  more  than  US$35  per  barrel 
in  1990  as  a  result  of  loss  of  supplies  from  Iraq  and  Kuwait,  and 
Mexico's  oil  export  revenues  rose  significantly  to  US$10  billion 
before  falling  back  some  15  percent  in  1991.  The  volume  of  oil 
exports  rose  slightly  to  1.4  million  bpd  in  1991,  then  held 
steady  along  with  production  in  1992,  as  the  oil  price  fell  to 
below  US$15  per  barrel. 

By  early  1993,  both  crude  oil  production  and  exports  had 
begun  to  decline.  The  drop  in  exports  resulted  from  both 
increased  domestic  demand  and  lower  total  production.  For  all 
of  1993,  Mexico's  oil  exports  averaged  1.3  million  bpd,  2  per- 
cent less  than  in  1992.  Exports  fell  even  more  sharply  in  terms 
of  value — to  US$7  billion — because  world  oil  prices  fell  steadily 


196 


The  Economy 


during  much  of  1992  and  1993.  In  1994  Mexico's  revenue  from 
oil  exports  was  more  than  US$7  billion. 

In  1995  the  oil  sector  generated  slightly  more  than  10  per- 
cent of  Mexico's  export  income  (down  from  almost  80  percent 
in  1982).  The  United  States  bought  54  percent  of  Mexico's 
crude  oil  exports  in  1991,  Western  Europe  bought  25  percent, 
and  Japan  bought  11  percent.  In  mid-1993,  heavy  Maya  crude 
accounted  for  67  percent  of  total  oil  exports,  the  lighter  Isth- 
mus crude  accounted  for  20  percent,  and  the  high-quality 
Olmeca  type  accounted  for  13  percent. 

In  1995  Mexico  was  the  world's  sixth-largest  producer  of 
crude  oil.  In  the  Western  Hemisphere,  only  the  United  States 
produced  more  oil  than  Mexico.  Directly  behind  Mexico  was 
Venezuela,  which  in  1992  produced  an  amount  equal  to  89  per- 
cent of  Mexico's  crude  oil  output.  The  oil  sector's  share  of 
overall  GDP  rose  slightly  from  5  percent  in  1985  to  more  than  6 
percent  by  1992.  In  1993  petroleum  provided  nearly  30  percent 
of  central  government  revenues.  Oil  output  rose  steadily  from 
2.5  million  bpd  in  1989  to  2.7  million  bpd  in  1991,  partly  in 
response  to  the  Persian  Gulf  crisis.  Production  held  steady  in 
1992,  then  began  to  decline  in  early  1993.  Mexico  consumed 
61  million  tons  of  oil  equivalent  in  1992.  Its  total  petroleum 
consumption  amounted  to  1.8  million  bpd  in  1992. 

For  the  first  ten  months  of  1995,  total  mineral  production 
(including  oil)  contracted  by  a  modest  1  percent.  For  all  of 
1995,  oil  production  fell  to  an  average  of  2.6  million  bpd  from 
2.7  million  bpd  in  1994.  However,  oil  output  in  the  first  quarter 
of  1996  increased  by  6  percent  over  the  first  quarter  of  1995  to 
an  average  of  2.8  million  bpd. 

In  1993  Pemex  operated  seven  oil  refineries  with  a  total 
capacity  of  more  than  1.5  million  bpd,  the  eleventh  largest  in 
the  world.  Mexico's  average  annual  oil  refining  capacity  grew 
steadily  from  63  million  tons  in  1983  to  84  million  tons  in  1990. 
The  country's  largest  oil  refineries  in  terms  of  refining  capacity 
were  those  at  Salina  Cruz  (330,000  bpd)  and  at  Tula  (320,000 
bpd)  in  the  state  of  Hidalgo.  Other  refineries  were  located  at 
Cadereyta  (235,0900  bpd  refining  capacity),  Salamanca 
(235,000  bpd),  Minatitlan  (200,000  bpd),  Ciudad  Madero 
(195,000  bpd),  and  Reynosa  (9,000  bpd). 

By  the  early  1990s,  some  40  percent  of  Mexico's  crude  petro- 
leum output  was  refined  domestically.  The  government 
invested  heavily  to  increase  the  capacity  of  existing  refineries 
and  construct  new  ones  in  order  to  retain  within  Mexico  the 


197 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


maximum  possible  amount  of  value  added  in  processing  crude 
petroleum.  In  the  early  1990s,  financial  difficulties  prevented 
Pemex  from  expanding  refinery  capacity  along  with  demand, 
forcing  Mexico  to  consume  more  of  its  oil  output  internally 
and  also  to  import  oil.  Petroleum  imports  rose  from  2  billion 
liters  in  1991  to  almost  5  billion  liters  in  1992.  Fuel  oil  imports 
rose  from  less  than  3  million  tons  in  1991  to  almost  4  million 
tons  in  1992. 

During  the  1980s,  Pemex  constructed  national  pipeline  dis- 
tribution systems  for  crude  and  refined  petroleum  products 
and  for  natural  gas.  In  1989  an  oil  pipeline  across  the  Tehuan- 
tepec  isthmus  opened  to  carry  550,000  bpd  of  Maya  crude 
petroleum  to  Salina  Cruz  on  the  Pacific  for  export  to  the  Far 
East.  Two  enormous  petrochemical  complexes  were  being  built 
at  Pajaritos  and  La  Cangrejera  in  Veracruz  to  supply  raw  mate- 
rials for  manufacturing  fertilizers,  detergents,  acrylic  resins, 
polyester  fibers,  emulsifying  agents,  and  other  petroleum  prod- 
ucts. 

In  1993  Mexico  had  the  world's  eighth  largest  crude  petro- 
leum reserves,  amounting  to  some  5  percent  of  the  world's 
total.  Its  proven  crude  oil  reserves  amounted  to  some  51  billion 
barrels  in  1993,  and  it  had  potential  reserves  of  some  250  bil- 
lion barrels.  The  Gulf  of  Mexico  contains  approximately  56 
percent  of  Mexico's  proven  reserves;  24  percent  are  located  in 
the  Chicontepec  region,  15  percent  are  located  in  Tabasco  and 
Chiapas,  and  the  remainder  are  elsewhere.  Mexico's  reserves 
are  sufficient  to  guarantee  current  production  levels  for  fifty 
years. 

Since  the  nationalization  of  the  oil  industry  in  1938,  the 
state-owned  Pemex  has  monopolized  the  production  and  mar- 
keting of  hydrocarbons.  For  decades  the  government  tolerated 
Pemex's  waste  and  inefficiency  because  the  company  produced 
nearly  all  public  revenues.  Problems  mounted,  however,  as  a 
result  of  Pemex's  poor  administration,  low  productivity,  over- 
staffing,  and  corruption.  By  the  late  1980s,  Mexico's  economic 
recovery  had  come  to  depend  heavily  on  reform  of  the  state  oil 
sector. 

After  becoming  president,  Salinas  moved  swiftly  to  modern- 
ize and  reorganize  the  oil  industry.  He  began  by  breaking  the 
power  of  the  oil  workers'  union,  which  had  contributed  to 
Pemex's  overall  inefficiency  by  forcing  the  hiring  of  tens  of 
thousands  of  unnecessary  workers.  In  January  1989,  Salinas 
had  the  union's  notoriously  corrupt  chief,  Joaquin  Hernandez 


198 


199 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Galicia  (nicknamed  La  Quina),  arrested  on  weapons  and  mur- 
der charges.  He  was  subsequently  convicted  and  received  a 
thirty-five-year  jail  sentence.  Salinas  then  ordered  Pemex  to 
monitor  and  account  for  its  internal  finances.  To  reduce 
expenses,  the  company  began  massive  employee  layoffs,  slash- 
ing its  workforce  by  94,000  (some  44  percent  of  the  total  pay- 
roll) by  mid-1993. 

In  April  1992,  natural  gas  from  a  Pemex  pipeline  leaked  into 
the  Guadalajara  sewer  system,  triggering  an  explosion  that 
killed  more  than  200  people.  The  tragedy  underscored 
Pemex's  bureaucratic  unwieldiness  and  lack  of  public  account- 
ability. Following  the  explosion,  Salinas  accelerated  the  organi- 
zational restructuring  of  Pemex.  The  restructuring  resulted  in 
the  company's  division  in  1992  into  four  subsidiaries:  Pemex- 
Exploration  and  Production  (E&P),  Pemex-Refining,  Pemex- 
Gas  and  Basic  Petrochemicals,  and  Pemex-Petrochemicals. 
Each  unit  became  a  semiautonomous  profit  center,  directing 
its  own  budget,  planning,  personnel,  and  other  functions.  The 
subsidiaries  deal  with  each  other  on  the  basis  of  formal  con- 
tracts and  market-based  transfer  prices.  The  governing  board 
of  each  subsidiary  is  composed  entirely  of  public-sector  offi- 
cials. 

Pemex's  new  focus  on  profitability  and  cost-cutting  allowed 
the  company  to  save  US$50  million  in  1990,  US$70  million  in 

1991,  and  US$100  million  in  1992.  Moreover,  Pemex  reduced 
its  total  labor  force  from  210,000  workers  in  1989  to  116,000  in 

1992,  with  more  dismissals  expected  later.  A  new  collective  con- 
tract permitted  the  company  to  seek  the  lowest  bidder  for 
maintenance,  transport,  slop  oil  disposal,  and  other  work  for- 
merly reserved  for  the  official  oil  workers'  union.  Pemex's  new 
focus  on  efficiency  and  productivity  also  cleared  the  way  for 
previously  unthinkable  foreign  involvement  in  Mexico's  oil  sec- 
tor. Several  United  States  oil  exploration  companies  received 
permission  to  drill  under  contract  in  Mexico,  and  foreign  part- 
nerships were  authorized. 

In  August  1993,  it  became  known  that  the  government  was 
considering  proposals  to  allow  private  companies  to  buy,  sell, 
and  distribute  imported  gasoline,  natural  gas,  and  petrochemi- 
cals, and  to  invest  in  new  pipelines.  Although  the  government 
reiterated  in  1992  its  longstanding  pledge  not  to  denationalize 
the  oil  industry,  some  observers  viewed  the  reorganization  of 
Pemex  as  a  move  to  improve  the  company's  efficiency  and  prof- 
itability as  a  prelude  to  privatization.  Denationalization  would 


200 


The  Economy 


require  amending  the  constitution  of  1917,  which  mandated 
state  ownership  and  exploitation  of  hydrocarbons. 

During  1995  Pemex  proceeded  with  its  plans  to  divest  its  sec- 
ondary petrochemicals  plants  and  allow  private  investment  in 
the  storage,  transportation,  and  distribution  of  natural  gas.  In 
late  1995,  Pemex  began  to  divest  itself  of  sixty-one  petrochemi- 
cal plants. 

In  early  1996,  the  government  unveiled  its  Program  for  the 
Development  and  Restructuring  of  the  Energy  Sector.  The  pro- 
gram estimates  the  minimum  investment  required  by  the 
petroleum  sector  by  the  year  2000  to  be  250  billion  new  pesos 
(at  1995  prices).  The  private  sector  is  expected  to  provide  49 
billion  new  pesos  of  this  amount.  The  plan  is  intended  to 
increase  Mexico's  petroleum  exports,  improve  its  competitive- 
ness in  the  international  energy  market,  and  contribute  to 
more  balanced  regional  development  (see  table  9,  Appendix). 

Electricity 

Mexico  generated  a  total  127  billion  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  of 
electricity  in  1991.  Of  this  total,  thermal  (coal-,  oil-,  or  gas- 
fired)  plants  generated  94  billion  kWh  (74  percent),  hydro- 
electric plants  generated  24  billion  kWh  (19  percent),  nuclear 
plants  generated  4  billion  kWh  (3  percent),  and  geothermal 
and  other  plants  generated  5  billion  kWh  (4  percent).  Mexico 
had  more  than  27,000  megawatts  of  electricity  generating 
capacity  in  1992,  roughly  the  level  of  domestic  demand.  Net 
domestic  electricity  consumption  in  1992  was  118  billion  kWh, 
including  24  billion  kWh  of  hydroelectric  power.  In  1992 
Mexico's  thermal  plants  generated  95  billion  kWh  of  electricity, 
hydroelectric  plants  generated  25  billion  kWh,  and  nuclear 
plants  generated  4  billion  kWh. 

Interest  revived  in  nuclear  power  generation  during  the  late 
1980s.  In  1989  the  much-delayed  1,300-megawatt  Laguna 
Verde  nuclear  reactor  began  partial  operation  (654  mega- 
watts), and  in  1990  it  produced  2.9  million  megawatt-hours  of 
electricity.  A  second  reactor  with  similar  capacity  became  oper- 
ational at  Laguna  Verde  in  1994. 

Mexico's  electric  power  companies  were  nationalized  during 
the  1960s,  and  the  public  sector  monopolized  electricity  gener- 
ation. In  1992  the  state-run  Federal  Electricity  Commission 
(Comision  Federal  de  Electricidad — CFE)  accounted  for  about 
90  percent  of  gross  electricity  generation.  In  May  1991,  the  gov- 
ernment enacted  legal  reforms  allowing  private  companies  to 


201 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

generate  electricity  either  for  their  own  consumption  or  for 
sale  to  the  CFE  or  small-scale  consumers  in  rural  or  remote 
area-megawatt  power  plants  by  2005. 

Nonfuel  Mining 

In  1994  the  mining  sector  accounted  for  some  2  percent  of 
GDP  and  1  percent  of  export  earnings.  It  employed  230,000 
people  in  1988.  Although  Mexico  had  approximately  2,000 
mining  companies  in  1989,  the  industry  was  highly  concen- 
trated, with  four  companies  producing  two-thirds  of  the  coun- 
try's total  mineral  output.  These  companies  were  the  Mexico 
Industrial  Mining  Group,  Inc.  (Grupo  Industrial  Minera 
Mexico,  Sociedad  Anonima — IMMSA),  Sanluis  Industrial  Cor- 
poration (Corporacion  Industrial  Sanluis),  Frisco  Enterprises 
(Empresas  Frisco),  and  Penoles  Industries  (Industrias 
Penoles). 

During  the  1960s,  the  government  progressively  Mexican- 
ized  the  mining  industry,  most  of  which  had  previously  been 
foreign-owned.  A  new  mining  law  in  1961  required  majority 
Mexican  ownership  and  management  of  all  mining  companies. 
Within  ten  years,  most  companies  had  been  Mexicanized.  The 
government  granted  new  concessions  only  to  Mexican-owned 
enterprises  and  encouraged  the  growth  of  small  and  medium- 
sized  operations. 

The  state  vastly  expanded  its  involvement  in  mining  during 
the  1970s.  The  1975  mining  law  restricted  foreign  companies 
to  34  percent  participation  in  mining  concessions  on  national 
reserves  and  in  exploitation  of  certain  minerals  such  as  coal 
and  iron  ore.  The  government  monopolized  exploitation  of  oil 
and  gas,  phosphate  rock,  potassium,  sulfur,  and  uranium.  By 
1980  it  owned  more  than  40  percent  of  shareholders'  equity  in 
all  mining  activity.  In  1983  mines  owned  by  or  affiliated  with 
the  state  mining  development  commission  were  responsible  for 
87  percent  of  copper  output,  76  percent  of  sulfur  output,  28 
percent  of  gold  and  silver,  27  percent  of  iron  ore,  25  percent  of 
coal,  18  percent  of  lead,  and  10  percent  of  zinc. 

The  mining  sector  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  only  0.4  per- 
cent between  1983  and  1989.  This  stagnation  resulted  from 
outmoded  mining  technology,  heavy  government  regulation, 
insufficient  investment,  and  low  world  prices.  The  government 
responded  in  1982  with  a  ten-year  program  to  sell  most  of  the 
state's  forty-two  mining  properties.  By  early  1987,  46  percent  of 
total  mineral  output  was  privately  produced,  and  42  percent

came  from  state  companies.  In  1988  the  government  sold  the 
Mexican  Copper  Company  (Compama  Mexicana  de  Cobre)  to 
private  buyers,  and  in  1990  it  privatized  the  country's  largest 
open-pit  copper  mine,  that  of  the  Cananea  Mining  Company 
(Compama  Minera  de  Cananea),  now  called  Mexicana  Com- 
pama de  Cananea,  despite  a  strike  by  the  company's  3,800 
workers  to  block  the  sale. 

In  the  early  1990s,  silver  was  the  most  valuable  subsector  in 
Mexico's  mining  industry  (see  table  10,  Appendix).  The  coun- 
try regained  its  historical  position  as  the  world's  leading  pro- 
ducer of  silver  following  the  opening  in  1983  of  the  world's 
largest  silver  mine  at  Real  de  Angeles  in  the  state  of  Zacatecas, 
which  in  1990  produced  290,000  kilograms  of  silver.  Mexico 
produced  2,300  tons  of  silver  in  1994,  representing  more  than 
16  percent  of  world  silver  output.  Most  of  Mexico's  silver  out- 
put came  from  the  states  of  Zacatecas  (39  percent),  Durango 
(15  percent),  Chihuahua  (14  percent),  Guanajuato  (7  per- 
cent), Sonora  (6  percent),  and  Hidalgo  (5  percent). 

Mexico's  gold  output  stood  at  14,400  kilograms  in  1994.  The 
Guanajuato  area  accounted  for  almost  one-third  of  Mexico's 
annual  gold  production.  This  region's  output  decreased  by 


203 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

about  1,000  kilograms  between  1991  and  1992,  slightly  offset- 
ting the  increase  of  900  kilograms  of  gold  production  from 
Sonora.  Other  important  gold-producing  areas  were  the  San 
Dimas  district  of  Durango  and  several  small  mines  in  Sinaloa. 
In  1992  Mexican  and  foreign  mining  companies  showed 
increased  interest  in  exploring  for  gold  in  the  states  of  Sonora, 
Baja  California  Norte,  Chihuahua,  Durango,  and  Sinaloa. 
Some  foreign  companies  established  wholly  foreign-owned 
exploration  enterprises  by  means  of  investment  trusts. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Mexico  was  the  world's  seventh  largest 
producer  of  copper.  Copper  ore  output  fluctuated  in  the  late 
1980s  and  early  1990s,  averaging  282,500  tons  per  year  between 
1987  and  1991.  Output  fell  slightly  to  266,200  tons  in  1992. 
Production  of  refined  copper  rose  steadily  from  140,800  tons 
in  1988  to  302,600  tons  in  1994.  Silver  prices  fell  and  copper 
prices  rose  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  increasing  the 
value  of  Mexico's  copper  output  over  that  of  silver  for  the  first 
time  in  several  decades.  Mexico's  copper  output  was  valued  at 
US$663  million  in  1992. 

Mexico's  western  mining  zone,  which  runs  from  the  states  of 
Baja  California  Norte,  Sonora,  Sinaloa,  and  western  Chihua- 
hua southward  to  Chiapas,  is  the  country's  main  source  of  cop- 
per. The  bulk  of  Mexico's  1992  copper  output  came  from 
Sonora,  where  the  country's  three  largest  mines — La  Caridad, 
Cananea,  and  Maria — are  located.  The  Mexican  Copper  Com- 
pany was  Mexico's  leading  copper  producer  with  52  percent  of 
total  output,  followed  by  the  Mexican  Compama  de  Cananea 
with  23  percent. 

In  1994  Mexico  produced  163,700  tons  of  lead  and  356,900 
tons  of  zinc.  Mexico's  production  of  zinc  constituted  4  percent 
of  world  output  in  1992,  and  zinc  ranked  second  among 
domestically  mined  minerals  in  terms  of  value,  after  copper  but 
ahead  of  silver.  Mine  production  of  lead  amounted  to  5  per- 
cent of  world  lead  output  in  1992,  and  that  mineral  ranked 
fifth  among  domestically  mined  minerals  in  terms  of  value, 
ahead  of  gold.  The  most  important  producers  of  zinc  and  lead 
were  Frisco  Enterprises  and  Penoles  Industries,  which  together 
produced  more  than  80  percent  of  Mexico's  total  supply  of 
these  minerals.  More  than  60  percent  of  Mexico's  lead  and  zinc 
output  came  from  the  state  of  Chihuahua,  while  much  of  the 
remainder  came  from  the  states  of  Zacatecas,  Hidalgo,  and  San 
Luis  Potosf. 


204 


The  Economy 


In  1992  Mexico  produced  some  5.5  million  tons  of  coal,  and 
it  had  an  estimated  1.7  billion  tons  of  coal  reserves.  Further 
development,  however,  was  not  seen  as  commercially  viable. 
The  country  consumed  some  5.8  million  tons  of  coal  in  1992. 
In  1990  Mexico  produced  iron  ore  with  a  metal  content  of  5.3 
million  tons,  most  of  it  from  Cerro  el  Mercado,  Las  Truchas, 
and  Peha  Colorado,  at  the  mouth  of  the  Rio  Balsas,  on  the 
Pacific  coast.  Most  of  Mexico's  coal  came  from  the  Sabinas 
basin,  about  100  kilometers  north  of  Monterrey. 

Transportation  and  Telecommunications 
Roads 

Mexico  has  one  of  the  most  extensive  highway  networks  in 
Latin  America,  linking  nearly  all  areas  of  the  national  territory. 
In  1994  Mexico  had  242,000  kilometers  of  roads,  of  which 
85,000  kilometers  were  paved  (including  more  than  3,100  kilo- 
meters of  expressways),  40,000  kilometers  were  gravel  or  cob- 
blestone, 62,000  kilometers  were  improved  earth,  and  55,000 
kilometers  were  unimproved  dirt  roads.  The  highway  system 
includes  federal  roads,  state  roads  (for  which  the  federal  gov- 
ernment provides  50  percent  of  construction  costs),  and  local 
roads  (for  which  the  federal  government  contributes  30  per- 
cent of  costs)  (see  fig.  10). 

The  most  heavily  traveled  highway  routes  form  a  triangle 
linking  Mexico  City  with  the  large  population  and  industrial 
centers  of  Guadalajara  and  Monterrey,  as  well  as  with  the  main 
port  city  of  Veracruz.  The  Inter-American  Highway  begins  at 
the  northern  border  city  of  Nuevo  Laredo  and  runs  through 
Monterrey  and  Mexico  City,  where  it  turns  southeastward 
toward  Oaxaca  and  then  directly  eastward  into  Chiapas  and 
northwestern  Guatemala.  Mexico  has  three  major  federal  high- 
ways: the  Baja  California  Dorsal  Highway,  which  runs  the 
length  of  the  peninsula  from  Tijuana  to  Cabo  San  Lucas;  the 
Trans-Mexico  Highway,  which  roughly  parallels  the  United 
States  border  between  Tijuana  on  the  Pacific  coast  and  Mata- 
moros  on  the  Gulf  of  Mexico;  and  the  Pacific  Coast  Highway, 
which  extends  from  Tijuana  to  Tapachula  on  the  Guatemalan 
border. 

Although  extensive,  much  of  Mexico's  public  highway  system 
is  in  poor  condition  as  a  result  of  insufficient  investment  in 
road  maintenance  and  an  overreliance  on  heavy  trucks  to  haul 
overland  cargo.  According  to  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary), 


205 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

in  1994,  61  percent  of  Mexican  public  roads  were  in  poor  con- 
dition, 29  percent  were  in  fair  condition,  and  only  10  percent 
were  in  good  condition.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  Salinas  govern- 
ment took  steps  to  reduce  the  strain  on  the  public  highway  sys- 
tem by  granting  concessions  to  the  private  sector  to  build  6,600 
kilometers  of  toll  roads  by  1994.  The  newly  built  toll  roads  are 
in  better  condition  than  the  public  highways,  but  tolls,  which 
were  driven  up  as  a  result  of  construction  cost  overruns,  have 
been  too  expensive  to  divert  a  significant  share  of  commercial 
traffic  from  the  public  roads. 

In  1992  total  vehicle  traffic  in  Mexico  included  7.5  million 
automobiles,  3.9  million  trucks,  and  more  than  106,000  buses. 
In  1995  there  were  12.1  million  registered  vehicles  in  Mexico. 
Intercity  bus  service  is  extensive,  with  bus  service  generally  con- 
sidered fair  to  good  on  most  intercity  routes.  Despite  the  avail- 
ability of  mass  transit,  the  proliferation  of  buses  and 
automobiles  in  greater  Mexico  City  has  far  outpaced  the  capi- 
tal's road  building  and  highway  expansion  capabilities,  causing 
chronic  urban  traffic  congestion  and  exacerbating  Mexico 
City's  legendary  smog  (see  Environmental  Conditions,  ch.  2). 

Railroads 

The  predominantly  state-owned  Mexican  railroad  system  is 
extensive,  consisting  in  1994  of  20,425  kilometers  of  1.435- 
meter,  standard-gauge  line  and  ninety  kilometers  of  0.914- 
meter  narrow-gauge  line.  A  102-kilometer  section  of  line 
between  Mexico  City  and  Queretaro  is  electrified. 

The  largest  rail  line  is  the  state-owned  Mexican  National 
Railways  (Ferrocarriles  Nacionales  Mexicanos — FNM),  which 
operates  on  about  70  percent  of  the  total  trackage  and  carries 
some  80  percent  of  total  rail  traffic.  The  second  largest  net- 
work, also  state-owned,  is  the  Pacific  Railroad,  which  links 
Nogales  and  Guadalajara.  The  three  smaller  government- 
owned  lines  are  the  Chihuahua  to  Pacific  Railroad,  the  Sonora 
to  Baja  California  Railroad,  and  the  United  Railroads  of  the 
Southeast. 

Several  Mexican  cities  have  rail  links  with  the  United  States, 
including  Ciudad  Juarez,  Laredo,  Piedras  Negras,  Reynosa, 
Matamoros,  Nogales,  Naco,  and  Agua  Prieta.  The  Mexican  rail 
system  also  connects  with  Central  American  lines  through  Gua- 
temala. 

In  1992  FNM's  rolling  stock  consisted  of  1,575  diesel  loco- 
motives and  42,240  freight  cars.  In  addition,  some  60,000  pri-

vately  owned  freight  cars  were  in  service.  In  1992  FNM  carried 
49  million  tons  of  freight,  representing  12  percent  of  all  long- 
haul  freight  traffic  in  Mexico. 

Railroads  were  only  lightly  used  by  passengers  in  the  early 
1990s,  accounting  for  just  2  percent  of  total  intercity  passenger 
travel.  In  1992  FNM  carried  almost  15  million  passengers  on  its 
fleet  of  more  than  800  passenger  rail  vehicles.  In  1993  it  began 
gradually  privatizing  its  passenger  operations  by  means  of  con- 
cessions to  private  carriers.  In  1995  the  Mexican  congress 
passed  legislation  allowing  private  investment  in  railways  under 
fifty-year  concessions.  Private  enterprises  were  allowed  to  oper- 
ate various  portions  of  the  rail  network,  provide  train  services, 
and  operate  railyards  and  terminals. 

Despite  its  abundant  mileage  and  rolling  stock,  the  Mexican 
railroad  system  was  generally  considered  to  be  antiquated  and 
inefficient  in  the  early  1990s.  Corporate  respondents  to  the 
World  Bank's  1994  survey  of  commercial  users  of  Mexican 
transportation  services  rated  the  state-owned  rail  network  as 
the  most  poorly  performing  component  of  Mexico's  national 
transportation  system.  Inadequate  maintenance,  mismanage- 
ment, and  corruption  were  cited  as  major  impediments  to  reli- 
able service.  In  1991  only  68  percent  of  locomotives  were 
available  for  use  at  any  given  time,  and  terminal  operations 
were  so  poorly  managed  that  only  20  percent  of  shipment  time 
was  spent  en  route.  To  avoid  delay,  spoilage,  and  loss  of  mer- 
chandise, Mexican  companies  attempted  whenever  possible  to 
bypass  the  rail  system  altogether  by  relying  heavily  on  long-haul 
trucks,  which  accounted  for  88  percent  of  all  overland  cargo 
travel  in  1992.  The  inefficiency  of  the  railroad  system  was  con- 
sidered a  major  impediment  to  Mexican  commercial  competi- 
tiveness under  the  new  NAFTA  trading  system. 

Rapid  Transit 

In  1969  Mexico  City  opened  its  subway  system  (Metro).  By 
1993  it  comprised  eight  lines  with  135  stations  and  a  total  route 
length  of  158  kilometers  (of  which  ninety-two  kilometers  were 
underground) .  The  Metro  is  a  heavy-rail  network  consisting  of 
more  than  250  nine-car  trains  traveling  on  1.435-meter  auxil- 
iary-guide rails.  A  computerized  system  of  traffic  control  is  used 
in  conjunction  with  human  operators  on  each  train.  In  1991 
the  system  handled  1.4  billion  passenger  journeys.  The  Federal 
District's  System  of  Electric  Transport  (Sistema  de  Transporte 
Electrico — STE),  which  oversees  rapid  transit  services  in 


209 


208 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


greater  Mexico  City,  plans  to  expand  the  Metro  system  to  fif- 
teen lines  totaling  315  kilometers  route-length  by  2010.  At  that 
point,  it  predicts  daily  ridership  will  exceed  12  million  passen- 
gers. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Guadalajara  inaugurated  a  modest  sub- 
way system.  Two  electrified  light-rail  lines  cross  in  the  city's  cen- 
ter and  extend  to  nearby  suburbs.  Tracks  are  underground  in 
the  downtown  area  and  use  existing  rail  right  of  ways  in  outly- 
ing areas. 

Ports  and  Shipping 

Mexico  has  some  10,000  kilometers  of  coastline  but  few  navi- 
gable rivers  and  no  good  natural  harbors.  The  country's  2,900 
kilometers  of  navigable  rivers  and  coastal  canals  play  only  a 
minor  role  in  the  transportation  system.  In  the  early  1990s, 
Mexico's  seventy-five  maritime  ports  and  nine  river  ports  han- 
dled 65  percent  of  imports  and  70  percent  of  nonpetroleum 
exports.  The  flow  of  freight  through  Mexican  ports  exceeded 
163  million  tons  of  cargo  in  1990,  representing  31  percent  of 
total  freight  carried  by  all  modes.  The  five  largest  ports — 
Tampico,  Veracruz,  Guaymas,  Mazatlan,  and  Manzanillo — han- 
dled 80  percent  of  Mexico's  ocean  freight. 

Veracruz  is  an  important  port  for  general  cargo,  especially 
goods  headed  to  and  from  Mexico  City.  The  port  of  Tampico 
primarily  handles  petroleum  and  petroleum  products.  Other 
important  seaports  include  Coatzacoalcos  on  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico  coast  and  Acapulco  on  the  Pacific.  Two  new  Pacific 
ports — Pichilingue  and  Topolobampo — were  built  in  the  early 
1990s,  and  another  was  built  on  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  coast  at 
Progreso,  in  the  state  of  Yucatan.  Between  1989  and  1994,  some 
US$700  million  was  spent  on  port  development,  more  than 
half  of  that  amount  provided  by  the  private  sector. 

Mexico's  system  of  state-owned  ports  is  administered  by  Mex- 
ican Ports  (Puertos  Mexicanos — PM),  a  decentralized  govern- 
ment agency  established  in  1989  to  oversee  the  rationalization 
and  streamlining  of  port  operations.  To  increase  the  quality  of 
service  in  the  shipping  sector  and  thereby  enhance  Mexico's 
export  performance,  the  government  announced  in  1992  that 
it  would  sell  management  concessions  for  nine  ports — includ- 
ing Acapulco,  Lazaro  Cardenas,  and  Manzanillo — to  private 
buyers.  In  1994  ownership  of  the  ports  of  Altamira,  Acapulco, 
Guaymas,  and  Tampico  passed  to  the  private  sector.  Mexico 
expected  to  complete  construction  by  1996  of  a  437-kilometer 


210

coastal  canal  between  Matamoros  and  Tampico,  intended  to 
connect  with  the  United  States  Intracoastal  Waterway  system 
through  the  Rio  Bravo  del  Norte  (Rio  Grande). 

In  1994  the  Mexican  merchant  marine  consisted  of  fifty- 
eight  vessels  of  more  than  1,000  gross  registered  tons,  includ- 
ing thirty-two  oil  tankers  owned  and  operated  by  Pemex.  The 
state-owned  Maritime  Transport  of  Mexico  (Transporte  Man- 
timo  de  Mexico)  operated  most  of  the  other  ships.  Maritime 
freight  is  about  evenly  distributed  between  coastal  and  ocean 
shipping,  whereas  most  seaborne  passenger  travel  is  coastal. 

Air  Transportation 

Mexico's  air  transportation  system  is  generally  considered 
adequate  to  handle  projected  levels  of  passenger  and  freight 
traffic  through  the  end  of  the  1990s.  In  1994  Mexico  had  a 
total  of  1,585  operational  airfields  or  airstrips,  of  which  202 
had  permanent-surface  runways.  Forty-four  international  and 
thirty-eight  domestic  airports  offer  services  to  all  major  Mexi- 
can cities.  Mexico's  principal  airport  and  main  air  transporta- 
tion hub  is  Benito  Juarez  International  Airport,  on  the 


211 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

outskirts  of  Mexico  City.  Other  major  airports  at  Monterrey, 
Guadalajara,  Merida,  and  Cancun  also  handle  large  volumes  of 
air  traffic. 

Air  transport  services  consist  overwhelmingly  of  passenger 
travel,  with  air  freight  representing  only  0.03  percent  by  weight 
of  total  cargo  transported  by  all  modes  in  1994.  Mexico's  prox- 
imity and  extensive  overland  and  maritime  links  to  the  United 
States,  its  main  trading  partner,  account  in  large  measure  for 
the  relatively  light  use  of  aircraft  to  transport  freight. 

In  1992  Mexico  had  seventy-seven  domestic  airlines,  of 
which  two,  Aeronaves  de  Mexico  (Aeromexico)  and  Mexican 
Aviation  Company  (Compania  Mexicana  de  Aviacion — Mexi- 
cana),  had  international  stature.  Aeromexico  was  sold  to  pri- 
vate investors  in  June  1989  after  it  had  declared  bankruptcy. 
Widely  known  in  the  past  as  "Aeromaybe"  because  of  unreliable 
service,  Aeromexico  has  maintained  consistent  on-time  perfor- 
mance since  its  privatization.  Also  in  1989,  the  government 
sold  half  of  its  51  percent  stake  in  Mexicana  to  private  inves- 
tors. 

In  1993  Mexican  aircraft  flew  a  total  of  325  million  kilome- 
ters and  carried  20  million  passengers.  Mexico  has  direct  air 
connections,  through  Mexicana  and  Aeromexico,  with  the 
United  States,  Canada,  Europe,  Australia,  and  the  rest  of  Latin 
America.  In  1994  twenty-eight  international  airlines  provided 
regularly  scheduled  service  from  Mexico  City  to  major  cities  in 
Europe,  Japan,  the  United  States,  and  the  rest  of  Latin  Amer- 
ica. In  addition,  a  variety  of  foreign  and  domestic  air  charter 
services  flew  directly  to  the  country's  major  resort  areas. 

Telecommunications 

In  December  1990,  Mexico  sold  its  state-owned  telephone 
system,  Mexican  Telephone  (Telefonos  de  Mexico — Telmex), 
to  private  investors  in  the  country's  largest  and  most  compli- 
cated privatization.  The  government  sold  majority  voting  rights 
and  a  20  percent  stake  in  Telmex  to  a  consortium  of  investors 
for  US$1.8  billion,  and  it  sold  US$3.7  billion  in  shares  to  the 
public  in  two  public  offerings.  Nevertheless,  customers  contin- 
ued to  complain  about  delays  in  contacting  operators,  install- 
ing new  phones,  and  receiving  service  upgrades. 

In  1995  the  Telmex  network  had  some  8.7  million  phone 
lines  in  service.  Almost  13  percent  of  all  international  calls 
from  the  United  States  were  made  to  Mexico  in  1993,  while 


212

more  than  90  percent  of  Mexico's  long-distance  calls  were 
made  to  the  United  States. 

To  improve  service  quality,  Telmex  inaugurated  a  US$30  bil- 
lion modernization  program  in  conjunction  with  its  partners, 
Southwestern  Bell  Corporation  and  France  Telecom,  in  1993. 
In  early  1994,  the  United  States  telecommunications  company 
Microwave  Communications  International  (MCI)  announced 
plans  to  collaborate  with  Banamex-Accival  Financial  Group 
(Grupo  Financiero  Banamex-Accival — Banacci),  Mexico's  larg- 
est financial  group,  in  building  a  new  long-distance  telephone 
network  in  Mexico.  The  two  companies  valued  the  joint  ven- 
ture at  US$1  billion,  of  which  MCI  would  invest  US$450  mil- 
lion. In  early  1994,  telephone  industry  analysts  expected 
Mexico's  US$6  billion  long-distance  telephone  market  to  con- 
tinue or  exceed  its  14  percent  annual  growth  rate.  The  high 
growth  rate  stemmed  from  increased  telephone  communica- 
tions between  the  United  States  and  Mexico  resulting  from 
NAFTA  and  the  government's  stated  intention  to  open  the 
long-distance  market  to  foreign  competition  in  January  1997.

tional  Telecommunications  Satellite  Corporation  (Intelsat). 
Mexico  is  also  connected  to  the  Central  American  Microwave 
System.  In  1985  the  Mexican-owned  Morelos-B  domestic  tele- 
communications satellite  was  launched  from  the  United  States 
space  shuttle  Atlantis.  Morelos-B  was  replaced  in  1993  by 
another  Mexican-owned  domestic  telecommunications  satel- 
lite, Solidarity  I. 

Radio 

In  1993  Mexico  had  more  than  700  commercial  amplitude 
modulation  (AM)  radio  stations,  including  679  stations  operat- 
ing on  mediumwave,  and  twenty-two  AM  shortwave  stations. 
The  country  has  a  number  of  large  commercial  radio  networks, 
including  National  Radio  Network  (Radio  Cadena  Nacional) 
and  Mexico  Radio  Programs  (Radio  Programas  de  Mexico). 
Mexico  also  has  some  cultural  radio  stations,  operated  either 
by  public  agencies  or  by  educational  institutions.  In  1996 
Mexico  had  21  million  radios. 

The  most  important  state-run  radio  systems  are  the  Mexican 
Radio  Institute  (Instituto  Mexicano  de  la  Radio — IMER), 
which  operates  two  networks,  Mexico  Radio  (Radio  Mexico) 
and  Exact  Time  Radio  (Radio  la  Hora  Exacta);  the  Education 
Ministry's  Education  Radio  (Radio  Education),  which  has  a 
reputation  for  objectivity;  and  Radio  UNAM  (UNAM  Radio), 
run  by  the  National  Autonomous  University  of  Mexico  (Uni- 
versidad  Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico — UNAM).  The  private 
commercial  sector  is  dominated  by  some  twenty  radio  net- 
works. Ninety-two  percent  of  stations  belong  to  a  network;  72 
percent  belong  to  or  are  controlled  by  ten  networks;  and  half 
are  controlled  by  the  top  five.  The  main  networks  include  the 
Acir  Group  (Grupo  Acir),  which  controls  140  stations  and  pro- 
duces three  major  news  programs  daily  for  national  distribu- 
tion; the  Radio  Promotional  Organization  (Organization 
Impulsora  de  Radio — OIR);  Radio  and  Television  Agency 
(Agentes  de  Radio  y  Television — ARTSA),  and  Mexico  Radio 
Programs. 

Television 

Introduced  in  1950,  television  reached  some  70  percent  of 
the  Mexican  population  by  the  early  1990s.  In  1995  Mexico 
had  326  television  stations  (almost  25  percent  of  all  stations  in 
Latin  America),  most  of  them  owned  by  or  affiliated  with  the 
Mexican  Telesystem  (Telesistema  Mexicano — known  popu-

The  Economy 


larly  as  Televisa)  and  the  state-run  Mexican  Institute  of  Televi- 
sion (Instituto  Mexicano  de  Television — Imevision).  In  1996 
Mexico  had  about  800  television  transmitters  and  an  average  of 
one  television  set  per  8.9  viewers. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Televisa  was  reportedly  the  largest  com- 
munications conglomerate  in  the  developing  world.  Although 
a  private  corporation,  Televisa  is  very  close  to  the  ruling  PRI.  It 
operates  three  commercial  television  networks  in  Mexico  and 
four  stations  in  the  United  States.  Its  main  network  broadcasts 
twenty-four  hours  a  day,  and  the  others  broadcast  between 
twelve  and  eighteen  hours  daily.  Televisa's  flagship  news  pro- 
gram is  "24  Horas,"  which  has  long  been  the  most  important 
source  of  news  for  many  Mexicans.  Televisa  exports  20,000 
hours  of  television  programming  to  other  Latin  American 
countries.  In  addition  to  television  and  radio,  Televisa  has 
interests  in  newspaper  and  book  publishing;  production  of 
records  and  home  videos;  motion  picture  distribution,  advertis- 
ing and  marketing;  and  real  estate,  tourism,  and  hotels. 

The  state-run  Imevision  operates  two  national  television  net- 
works, as  well  as  several  regional  and  specialized  channels.  The 
government  also  operates  Mexican  Republic  Television  (Tele- 
vision de  la  Republica  Mexicana),  which  broadcasts  news  and 
educational  and  cultural  programs  to  rural  areas,  and  Cultural 
Television  of  Mexico  (Television  Cultural  de  Mexico).  A  com- 
peting network,  Television  Independiente,  operates  seven  sta- 
tions. There  are  also  some  twenty  independent  stations. 

In  November  1993,  the  government  granted  licenses  for 
sixty-two  new  local  television  stations,  increasing  Televisa's  total 
number  of  stations  from  229  to  291.  Most  of  the  new  stations 
are  concentrated  in  northern  Mexico.  Televisa  showed  consid- 
erable financial  strength  in  1993,  with  third-quarter  profits  of 
some  US$120  million,  up  43  percent  from  the  same  period  of 
1992.  The  company  planned  additional  large  investments  in  an 
effort  to  maintain  its  90  percent  share  of  Mexico's  television 
market.  Televisa's  main  competitor  is  Television  Azteca,  which 
owns  179  stations  in  two  national  networks.  Although  it  com- 
manded less  than  10  percent  of  the  national  television  market 
in  1993,  it  is  attempting  to  increase  its  market  share  to  24  per- 
cent by  2000. 

Tourism 

During  the  1970s  and  1980s,  tourism  generated  more  than  3 
percent  of  Mexico's  GNP  and  between  9  percent  and  13  per- 


215 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

cent  of  its  foreign-exchange  earnings.  Only  petroleum  gener- 
ated more  net  foreign  exchange.  The  number  of  arriving 
tourists  rose  steadily  from  more  than  5  million  in  1987  to  7  mil- 
lion in  1990,  despite  the  peso's  overvaluation  during  those 
years.  The  number  of  arrivals  subsequently  fell  to  about  6  mil- 
lion in  1991  and  1992  as  the  overvalued  peso  raised  costs  for 
United  States  visitors.  Mexico  had  7  million  foreign  arrivals  in 
1994,  and  tourism  generated  total  revenue  of  US$4.2  billion. 

Eighty-three  percent  of  foreign  visitors  to  Mexico  in  1993 
came  from  the  United  States,  many  of  them  from  the  border 
states  for  short  visits.  Eight  percent  of  foreign  visitors  came 
from  Europe,  and  6  percent  from  other  Latin  American  coun- 
tries. In  1990  United  States  residents  made  some  70  million  vis- 
its to  Mexico's  border  towns,  and  Mexicans  made  88  million 
visits  to  United  States  border  towns.  In  1984  visitors  to  Mexican 
border  areas  spent  some  US$1.3  billion,  compared  with  US$2.0 
billion  spent  by  all  tourists  in  the  interior.  By  1990  border  visi- 
tors spent  more  than  US$2.5  billion,  while  visitors  to  the  inte- 
rior spent  approximately  US$4.0  billion.  In  1991  each  foreign 
tourist  spent  an  average  amount  of  US$594.  In  1992  Mexico 
had  some  8,000  hotels  and  some  353,000  hotel  rooms. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Mexico  City  was  the  most  popular  destina- 
tion for  foreign  tourists,  followed  by  Acapulco.  In  the  mid- 
1970s,  the  official  tourist  development  agency,  Fonatur,  began 
to  promote  new  tourist  areas,  including  Zihuatanejo,  Ixtapa, 
and  Puerto  Escondido  on  the  Pacific  coast,  and  Cancun  on  the 
Caribbean  coast.  In  1986  and  1987,  work  began  on  the  new 
Pacific  coast  tourist  resort  of  Huatulco.  Mexico's  tourist  indus- 
try is  particularly  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  such  as  natural 
disasters  and  bad  weather,  international  incidents,  and  varia- 
tions in  the  exchange  rate,  as  well  as  changes  in  national  regu- 
lations. For  instance,  a  1985  earthquake  that  had  an  epicenter 
near  Acapulco  damaged  many  of  Mexico  City's  central  hotels. 
In  September  1987,  Hurricane  Gilbert  struck  Cancun,  causing 
US$80  million  worth  of  damage  that  took  three  months  to 
repair. 

Foreign  Trade 

Stabilization  and  adjustment  policies  implemented  by  the 
Mexican  government  during  the  1980s  caused  a  sharp  fall  in 
imports  and  a  corresponding  increase  in  exports.  Average  real 
exchange  rates  rose,  domestic  demand  contracted,  and  the 
government  provided  lucrative  export  incentives,  making 


216 


The  Economy 


exportation  the  principal  path  to  profitable  growth.  The  1982 
peso  devaluation  caused  Mexico's  imports  to  decline  60  per- 
cent in  value  to  US$8.6  billion  by  the  end  of  1983.  After  years 
of  running  chronic  trade  deficits,  Mexico  achieved  a  net  trade 
surplus  of  US$13.8  billion  in  1993. 

Imports 

After  1983  the  government  eliminated  import  license 
requirements,  official  import  prices,  and  quantitative  restric- 
tions. This  trade  liberalization  program  sought  to  make  Mexi- 
can producers  more  competitive  by  giving  them  access  to 
affordable  inputs.  By  1985  the  share  of  total  imports  subject  to 
licensing  requirements  had  fallen  from  75  percent  to  38  per- 
cent. In  1986  Mexico  acceded  to  the  General  Agreement  on 
Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT),  now  the  World  Trade  Organization 
(WTO),  and  in  1987  it  agreed  to  a  major  liberalization  of  bilat- 
eral trade  relations  with  the  United  States. 

As  a  consequence  of  trade  liberalization,  the  share  of  domes- 
tic output  protected  by  import  licenses  fell  from  92  percent  in 
June  1985  to  18  percent  by  the  end  of  1990.  The  maximum  tar- 
iff was  lowered  from  100  percent  in  1985  to  20  percent  in  1987, 
and  the  weighted  average  tariff  fell  from  29  percent  in  1985  to 
12  percent  by  the  end  of  1990.  The  volume  of  imports  subject 
to  entry  permits  was  reduced  from  96  percent  of  the  total  in 
1982  to  4  percent  by  1992.  The  remaining  export  controls 
applied  mainly  to  food  products,  pharmaceuticals,  and  petro- 
leum and  oil  derivatives. 

The  value  of  Mexico's  imports  rose  steadily  from  US$50  bil- 
lion in  1991  to  US$79  billion  in  1994  (19  percent  of  GDP).  It 
rose  in  response  to  the  recovery  of  domestic  demand  (espe- 
cially for  food  products);  the  new  peso's  new  stability;  trade  lib- 
eralization; and  growth  of  the  nontraditional  export  sector, 
which  required  significant  capital  and  intermediate  inputs  (see 
table  11,  Appendix).  As  a  result  of  the  new  peso  devaluation  of 
December  1994,  Mexico's  imports  in  1995  were  US$73  billion, 
9  percent  lower  than  the  1994  figure.  In  1995  Mexico  imported 
US$5  billion  worth  of  consumer  goods  (7  percent  of  total 
imports),  US$9  billion  worth  of  capital  goods  (12  percent), 
and  US$59  billion  worth  of  intermediate  goods  (81  percent). 
Renewed  growth  and  the  new  peso's  real  appreciation  were 
expected  to  increase  demand  for  foreign  products  during 
1996.  Imports  rose  by  12  percent  in  the  first  quarter  of  1996  to 
US$20  billion. 


217 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

The  government  tried  to  curb  the  early  1990s'  rise  in 
imports  by  acting  against  perceived  unfair  trade  practices  by 
other  countries.  In  early  1993,  Mexico  retaliated  against 
alleged  dumping  of  United  States,  Republic  of  Korea  (South 
Korean),  and  Chinese  goods  by  imposing  compensatory  quotas 
on  brass  locks,  pencils,  candles,  fiber  products,  sodium  carbon- 
ate, and  hydrogen  peroxide.  Antidumping  duties  were  applied 
to  steel  products,  and  all  importers  were  required  to  produce 
certification  of  origin. 

But  Mexico  also  was  subject  to  complaints  by  other  coun- 
tries, which  charged  that  Mexico  itself  engaged  in  unfair  prac- 
tices. The  European  Community  (now  the  European  Union — 
EU)  and  Japan  lodged  complaints  with  the  GATT  about 
Mexico's  invocation  of  sanitary  standards  in  late  1992  to  limit 
meat  imports. 

Exports 

The  mid-1980s  decline  in  world  petroleum  prices  caused  the 
value  of  Mexico's  exports  to  fall  from  US$24  billion  in  1984  to 
US$16  billion  in  1986,  reflecting  the  country's  continued  heavy 
dependence  on  petroleum  export  revenue.  Lower  oil  earnings 
helped  to  reduce  Mexico's  trade  surplus  to  almost  US$5  billion 
in  1986.  Export  revenue  rose  slightly  to  US$21  billion  in  1987, 
as  oil  prices  began  to  recover.  Exports  continued  to  rise  mod- 
estly but  steadily  thereafter,  reaching  US$28  billion  in  1992. 
The  government  promoted  exports  vigorously  in  an  effort  to 
close  a  trade  gap  that  began  in  1989  and  widened  in  subse- 
quent years.  The  state-run  Foreign  Commerce  Bank  channeled 
finance  to  a  wide  range  of  potential  exporters,  especially  small 
and  medium-sized  firms  and  agricultural  and  fishing  enter- 
prises. In  1993  it  provided  US$350  million  for  the  tourist  sec- 
tor, representing  a  35  percent  increase  over  1992. 

The  value  of  Mexico's  exports  rose  steadily  from  US$43  bil- 
lion in  1991  to  US$61  billion  in  1994,  despite  the  new  peso's 
overvaluation.  The  currency  devaluation  of  late  1994  contrib- 
uted to  a  significant  jump  in  the  value  of  Mexico's  exports  to 
US$80  billion  in  1995,  a  31  percent  increase  over  the  previous 
year. 

Total  export  earnings  for  the  first  quarter  of  1996  were 
US$22  billion.  Manufactures  accounted  for  US$67  billion  (84 
percent)  of  Mexico's  exports  in  1995,  followed  by  oil  exports 
(US$9  billion  or  11  percent),  agricultural  products  (US$4  bil- 
lion, or  5  percent),  and  mining  products  (US$545  million,  or 


218 


The  Economy 


less  than  1  percent).  This  improved  export  performance 
resulted  from  the  new  peso  devaluation,  weak  domestic 
demand  because  of  the  recession,  new  export  opportunities 
opened  by  NAFTA,  and  improved  commodity  prices.  Export 
growth  was  expected  to  slow  during  1996,  as  a  result  of  recov- 
ery of  domestic  demand,  expected  drops  in  the  prices  of  oil 
and  other  nonfood  items,  capacity  constraints,  and  strengthen- 
ing of  the  new  peso. 

Composition  of  Exports 

The  1985  peso  devaluations  and  the  1986  oil  price  collapse 
produced  a  dramatic  shift  in  the  composition  of  Mexico's 
exports.  The  value  of  Mexico's  oil  exports  plummeted  from 
US$13  billion  in  1985  to  less  than  US$6  billion  in  1986.  The  oil 
sector's  share  of  total  export  revenue  consequently  fell  from  78 
percent  in  1982  to  42  percent  in  1987.  Oil  export  revenue 
recovered  in  1987  to  US$7.9  billion  as  petroleum  prices  rose. 
Prompted  by  the  peso  devaluation  and  low  domestic  demand, 
nonoil  exports  rose  41  percent  in  1986  and  an  additional  24 
percent  in  1987.  In  1987  manufactured  exports  (especially 
engineering  and  chemical  products)  constituted  48  percent  of 
total  exports  by  value,  eclipsing  petroleum  and  reducing 
Mexico's  vulnerability  to  fluctuations  in  the  world  oil  price. 
Between  1988  and  1991,  petroleum  exports  fell  22  percent  in 
value  because  of  lower  world  oil  prices  and  declining  sales, 
while  nonoil  exports  rose  15  percent  in  value.  By  1992  petro- 
leum contributed  only  30  percent  of  total  exports  by  value. 

In  1994  petroleum  and  its  derivatives  accounted  for  US$7 
billion,  or  12  percent,  of  Mexico's  total  export  revenue  of 
US$62  billion.  Transport  equipment  and  machinery  exports 
earned  US$33  billion,  or  54  percent  of  total  exports.  Chemicals 
earned  US$3  billion,  or  5  percent,  and  metals  and  manufac- 
tured metal  products  earned  US$3  billion,  or  5  percent.  Agri- 
cultural, processed  food,  beverage,  and  tobacco  products 
accounted  for  US$3  billion,  or  5  percent  of  total  exports. 

Trade  Balance 

Import  growth  outstripped  export  performance  in  the  early 
1990s,  producing  a  steadily  widening  trade  deficit.  In  1988 
Mexico's  trade  surplus  had  fallen  to  US$1.7  billion,  and  the  fol- 
lowing year  it  turned  into  a  US$645  million  deficit  as  imports 
rose  24  percent  against  export  growth  of  11  percent.  In  1990 
the  trade  deficit  widened  to  US$4.4  billion,  despite  a  rise  in 


219 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

international  oil  prices  resulting  from  the  Persian  Gulf  War. 
Petroleum  exports  rose  slightly,  and  nonoil  exports  grew  12 
percent  in  1990,  producing  total  export  earnings  growth  of  18 
percent.  But  total  imports  increased  a  much  more  rapid  34  per- 
cent. In  1991  the  trade  gap  widened  further  to  US$7.3  billion, 
as  the  level  of  exports  remained  steady  while  imports  grew  22 
percent.  Mexico's  trade  deficit  widened  again  to  US$15.9  bil- 
lion in  1992.  Following  a  slowdown  in  import  growth  in  1993, 
the  trade  deficit  increased  substantially  in  1994,  the  first  year 
under  NAFTA.  Low  interest  rates  and  an  overvalued  new  peso 
bolstered  demand  for  foreign  goods,  causing  imports  to  grow 
an  estimated  19  percent.  Spurred  by  the  newly  devalued  cur- 
rency, Mexico's  foreign  trade  balance  swung  dramatically  back 
to  a  US$7.1  billion  surplus  in  1995,  effectively  eliminating  the 
country's  current  account  deficit.  The  trade  surplus  was 
US$1.7  billion  for  the  first  quarter  of  1996,  compared  with  the 
first  quarter  of  1995  figure  of  US$647  million. 

Direction  of  Trade 

Largely  as  a  result  of  trade  liberalization,  two-way  trade 
between  Mexico  and  the  United  States  doubled  between  1986 
and  1990.  In  the  late  1980s,  Mexico  expanded  its  exports  to  the 
United  States  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  15  percent.  Even 
prior  to  NAFTA,  more  than  85  percent  of  Mexican  exports 
entered  the  United  States  duty-free  (see  table  12,  Appendix). 

In  1994  the  value  of  two-way  United  States-Mexico  trade 
amounted  to  more  than  US$100  billion.  Mexico  exported 
US$53  billion  worth  of  products  to  the  United  States  and 
imported  US$56  billion  worth  of  United  States  goods.  Mexico's 
commercial  reliance  on  the  United  States  has  increased  in 
recent  years,  despite  efforts  to  diversify  its  export  markets  and 
import  sources.  In  1994  the  United  States  took  85  percent  of  all 
Mexican  exports  (up  from  83  percent  in  1993).  Sales  to  Mexico 
accounted  for  only  8  percent  of  all  United  States  exports  in 
1991.  Sales  to  Canada  amounted  to  more  than  US$1.5  billion, 
or  2  percent  of  Mexican  exports  in  1994;  sales  to  Japan 
amounted  to  US$997  million,  or  less  than  2  percent.  Spain, 
Germany,  and  France  together  accounted  for  nearly  US$2  bil- 
lion, or  3  percent,  of  Mexico's  export  revenue  in  1994.  In  1994 
the  United  States  provided  69  percent  of  Mexico's  imports, 
Japan  6  percent,  Germany  4  percent,  Canada  2  percent,  and 
France  2  percent. 


220 


The  Economy 


Mexico's  sales  to  other  Latin  American  countries  totaled 
US$2.9  billion  in  1993,  a  65  percent  increase  over  1988.  Never- 
theless, these  sales  constituted  only  some  10  percent  of 
Mexico's  total  exports  by  value.  Two-way  trade  between  Mexico 
and  the  rest  of  Latin  America  increased  to  about  250  percent 
between  1988  and  1993.  Mexico's  most  important  trading  part- 
ners in  Latin  America  were  Argentina  and  Brazil. 

Trade  Agreements 

In  1991  Mexico  and  Chile  signed  a  bilateral  free-trade  agree- 
ment under  which  each  country  would  gradually  reduce  tariffs 
on  three  categories  of  products.  As  a  result,  Chilean  exports  to 
Mexico  increased  112  percent  between  1991  and  1993,  and  an 
additional  33  percent  (US$89  million  in  value)  between  Janu- 
ary and  August  1993. 

Mexico  also  formed  a  trilateral  free-trade  association  with 
Colombia  and  Venezuela  known  as  the  Group  of  Three  (G-3). 
Negotiations  were  concluded  in  1993,  and  the  agreement  took 
effect  during  1994.  Tariffs  on  most  products  were  to  be  gradu- 
ally eliminated  over  ten  years  (twelve  years  for  automobiles). 
The  agreement  was  expected  to  create  a  US$373  billion  eco- 
nomic market  encompassing  some  145  million  people.  In 
October  1993,  the  G-3  countries  announced  their  intention  to 
establish  a  wider  Association  of  Caribbean  States  (ACS).  In 
March  1994,  Mexico  and  Costa  Rica  negotiated  a  bilateral  free- 
trade  agreement  that  was  expected  to  provide  a  model  for  simi- 
lar agreements  between  Mexico  and  other  Central  American 
countries.  Mexico  also  discussed  a  free-trade  agreement  with 
the  EU  and  membership  in  the  new  Asia-Pacific  Economic 
Cooperation  forum. 

President  Salinas's  most  significant  commercial  achieve- 
ment, however,  was  the  successful  conclusion  of  NAFTA  negoti- 
ations with  the  United  States  and  Canada  in  1993.  Salinas 
sought  free  trade  with  the  United  States  largely  in  order  to 
increase  private  investment,  attract  new  technology,  and  ensure 
continued  access  for  Mexican  goods  to  the  United  States  mar- 
ket. Mexico's  neoliberal  development  strategy  depended  on 
promotion  of  manufactured  exports,  which  in  turn  required 
expanded  United  States-Mexican  trade.  Salinas  also  sought  a 
free-trade  agreement  with  the  United  States  and  Canada  to 
reassure  potential  investors  of  the  continuity  and  stability  of 
Mexican  economic  policy,  and  to  provide  formal  legal  proce- 
dures for  resolving  commercial  disputes.  The  agreement  pro- 


221 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

vided  for  ongoing  consultation  on  issues  of  mutual  concern  to 
member  countries,  including  health  regulations,  product  subsi- 
dies, rules  of  origin,  and  quality  standards  (see  President  Sali- 
nas, ch.  1). 

NAFTA  provides  for  the  elimination  of  Mexican  tariffs  on 
5,900  categories  of  imports  from  the  United  States  and  Canada 
(mostly  machinery  and  intermediate  goods),  representing 
more  than  40  percent  of  Mexico's  overall  trade.  Other  prod- 
ucts are  reclassified  in  a  simplified  tariff  list  having  four  rate 
bands — 5  percent,  10  percent,  15  percent,  and  20  percent.  The 
United  States  eliminated  tariffs  on  3,100  additional  categories 
of  Mexican  goods,  bringing  to  80  percent  the  portion  of  all 
Mexican  exports  to  the  United  States  that  will  be  free  from  tar- 
iffs. Some  4,200  categories  already  had  been  included  in  the 
General  System  of  Preferences  (GSP)  and  were  thus  already 
exempt  from  tariffs.  The  treaty  eliminates  some  tariffs  immedi- 
ately and  phases  out  the  rest  over  five,  ten,  or  fifteen  years,  with 
vulnerable  industries  in  the  United  States  and  Mexico  receiv- 
ing the  longest  protection. 

Mexico's  deadlines  for  lowering  trade  barriers  are  generally 
longer  than  those  for  Canada  and  the  United  States.  The  latter 
countries  are  required  to  lift  immediately  their  tariffs  on  some 
80  percent  of  Mexico's  nonoil  exports,  while  Mexico  must 
grant  immediate  free  entry  to  42  percent  of  United  States  and 
Canadian  exports.  Special  rules  apply  for  trade  in  textiles,  vehi- 
cles and  auto  parts,  and  agricultural  products.  The  treaty  also 
governs  trade  in  services,  including  overland  transport,  tele- 
communications, and  financial  services,  and  it  includes  provi- 
sions for  the  liberalization  of  government  procurement. 

NAFTA  requires  Mexico  to  abolish  protectionist  limitations 
on  foreign  investment  (except  in  the  energy  sector),  allow  free 
profit  repatriation  by  United  States  and  Canadian  firms,  and 
guarantee  investors  against  property  seizure  without  full  com- 
pensation. The  treaty  allows  foreign  banks  to  take  up  to  25  per- 
cent of  Mexico's  banking  market  and  allows  foreign  brokerages 
to  take  30  percent  of  the  securities  business  by  2004,  after 
which  all  restrictions  are  to  be  eliminated. 

NAFTA  is  expected  to  create  a  free-trade  area  with  a  com- 
bined population  of  356  million  and  a  GDP  of  more  than  US$6 
trillion.  It  commits  future  Mexican  governments  to  preserve 
liberal  trade  and  investment  policies,  and  it  maintains  pressure 
on  Mexico  to  increase  its  trade  competitiveness.  The  agree- 
ment is  likely  to  spur  both  foreign  investment  and  increased

exports,  which  will  allow  expansion  of  private  consumption 
and  domestic  investment  as  monetary  controls  are  relaxed  and 
interest  rates  fall.  NAFTA's  accession  clause  (Article  2005) 
allows  any  country  or  group  of  countries  to  join  the  treaty  pro- 
vided it  negotiates  mutually  acceptable  terms.  New  accessions 
are  to  be  ratified  according  to  each  member's  "standard 
approval  procedures."  Each  current  member  enjoys  an  effec- 
tive veto  over  admission  of  new  members.  Although  Mexico  has 
not  opposed  Chilean  accession,  it  is  unlikely  to  support  a  Cen- 
tral American  application  for  fear  of  competition  from  these 
countries  for  new  textile  factories  and  other  light  industrial 
installations. 

Balance  of  Payments 

Current  Account 

From  the  mid-1970s  through  the  early  1980s,  Mexico  faced 
persistent  balance-of-payments  problems  resulting  from  the 
government's  efforts  to  defend  the  overvalued  peso  while 
incurring  massive  external  debts.  By  the  late  1970s,  oil  prices 
had  begun  to  fall,  and  international  interest  rates  rose  sharply, 
throwing  Mexico's  external  payments  so  far  out  of  balance  that 


223 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

by  mid-1982  the  country  could  no  longer  service  its  external 
debt.  The  government  was  forced  to  declare  a  unilateral  mora- 
torium on  debt  service,  devalue  the  peso,  and  drastically 
reduce  public  spending.  By  1985  these  measures  had  brought 
the  current  account  back  into  surplus  and  eliminated  the  gov- 
ernment's fiscal  deficit,  but  at  the  cost  of  foregone  economic 
growth  and  a  sharp  deterioration  in  the  capital  account. 
Throughout  the  early  and  mid-1980s,  Mexico  suffered  a  net 
capital  outflow  as  a  result  of  external  debt  service,  high  domes- 
tic capital  flight,  and  weak  foreign  investment. 

International  oil  prices  collapsed  in  1986,  pushing  Mexico's 
current  account  back  into  deficit.  Meanwhile,  debt-equity 
exchanges  and  capital  repatriation  produced  a  significant  capi- 
tal inflow  and  brought  the  capital  account  back  into  surplus. 
The  external  account  balance  was  again  reversed  in  1987,  as 
higher  oil  prices,  increased  nonoil  revenue,  a  new  commercial 
bank  loan,  and  continued  capital  repatriation  generated  a 
US$4  billion  current-account  surplus,  while  heavy  debt  service 
obligations  forced  the  capital  account  into  a  US$2.5  billion  def- 
icit. 

Mexico's  trade  deficit  rose  sharply  between  1989  and  1994, 
pushing  the  current  account  deeply  into  deficit.  The  current- 
account  deficit  ballooned  from  US$4  billion  in  1989  to  US$29 
billion  in  1994.  Capital  inflows  were  adequate  to  cover  the  cur- 
rent-account deficit  through  1993,  but  began  to  falter  in 
response  to  a  series  of  political  crises  in  1994.  The  dramatic 
improvement  in  Mexico's  trade  balance  between  1994  and 
1995  enabled  the  current-account  deficit  to  fall  to  US$654  mil- 
lion in  1995  and  to  be  nearly  eliminated  by  early  1996.  This 
development  increased  the  likelihood  that  the  new  peso  would 
be  strengthened  by  capital  inflows,  especially  portfolio  invest- 
ment. 

Capital  Account 

Mexico  hemorrhaged  capital  through  most  of  the  1980s. 
According  to  Morgan  Guaranty,  some  US$53  billion  fled  the 
country  between  1975  and  1985.  Total  capital  flight  from 
Mexico  between  1983  and  1988  was  approximately  US$18  bil- 
lion. Debt  amortization  was  another  major  negative  item  in  the 
capital  account.  According  to  the  World  Bank,  debt  repay- 
ments averaged  US$5  billion  annually  between  1985  and  1990. 
Capital  began  to  return  to  Mexico  in  1986  and  1987,  as  inves- 
tors and  lenders  were  attracted  by  high  domestic  interest  rates. 


224 


The  Economy 


The  trend  was  reversed  in  1988  as  a  result  of  an  exchange-rate 
freeze,  domestic  interest-rate  reductions,  competition  from 
higher  United  States  interest  rates,  and  political  uncertainty. 
But  capital  flows  were  positive  again  between  1989  and  1993. 

In  November  1993,  the  Mexican  government  announced 
that  cumulative  foreign  investment  between  December  1988 
and  November  1993  was  US$34  billion,  exceeding  by  40  per- 
cent the  government's  original  target.  United  States  direct 
investment  in  Mexico  more  than  doubled  between  1986  and 
1993,  to  US$23  billion.  United  States-based  multinationals  pro- 
vided more  than  60  percent  of  foreign  direct  investment  in 
Mexico  at  the  end  of  1992.  During  1993  foreign  investors  vastly 
increased  their  holdings  of  Mexican  stocks  and  bonds,  produc- 
ing a  huge  inflow  of  portfolio  investment.  In  October  1993,  for- 
eign investors  held  29  percent  of  Mexican  stocks  and  74 
percent  of  bonds. 

Foreign  investment  for  all  of  1993  reached  a  record  US$16 
billion,  an  increase  of  87  percent  over  1992.  Some  two-thirds  of 
this  amount  (US$11  billion)  was  portfolio  investment,  while 
US$12  billion  went  to  projects  approved  by  the  National  For- 
eign Investment  Commission  (Comision  Nacional  de  Inversion 
Extranjera — CNIE)  and  the  remaining  US$3  billion  went  to 
investments  approved  in  the  government's  official  register.  The 
manufacturing  sector  received  47  percent  of  the  new  invest- 
ment, and  the  services  sector  received  30  percent.  The  capital 
inflow  boosted  Mexico's  capital-account  surplus  to  US$16  bil- 
lion between  January  and  June  1993,  representing  a  35  percent 
increase  over  the  same  period  of  1992.  The  government  was 
counting  on  the  capital  inflow  to  ensure  a  continued  large  cap- 
ital account  surplus  with  which  to  balance  the  current-account 
deficit. 

Mexico's  capital  account  registered  a  US$15  billion  surplus 
in  1995,  mainly  because  of  the  country's  huge  increase  in  bor- 
rowing. Loan  disbursements  to  Mexico  rose  from  US$7  billion 
in  1994  to  US$27  billion  in  1995.  Foreign  direct  investment 
dropped  by  US$4  billion  to  a  total  of  US$7  billion  for  the  year, 
while  stock-market  investment  plunged  from  US$4  billion  in 
1994  to  US$519  million  in  1995.  The  capital-account  surplus 
allowed  Mexico's  international  reserves  to  recover  from  a  low 
of  US$3.5  billion  in  January  1995  to  US$15.7  billion  by  year's 
end.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Foreign  Investment  Regulation 

Restrictions  on  direct  foreign  investment  were  eased  during 
the  administrations  of  presidents  de  la  Madrid  and  Salinas.  In 
1990  the  government  revised  Mexico's  1973  foreign  investment 
law,  opening  up  to  foreign  investment  certain  sectors  of  the 
economy  that  previously  had  been  restricted  to  Mexican 
nationals  or  to  the  state.  The  new  regulations  permitted  up  to 
100  percent  foreign  ownership  in  many  industries. 

However,  in  1992  the  government  continued  to  retain  sole 
rights  to  large  parts  of  the  economy,  including  oil  and  natural 
gas  production,  uranium  production  and  treatment,  basic 
petrochemical  production,  rail  transport,  and  electricity  distri- 
bution. Economic  sectors  reserved  for  Mexican  nationals 
included  radio  and  television,  gas  distribution,  forestry,  road 
transport,  and  domestic  sea  and  air  transport.  The  government 
limited  foreign  investors  to  30  percent  ownership  of  commer- 
cial banks,  40  percent  ownership  of  secondary  petrochemical 
and  automotive  plants,  and  49  percent  ownership  of  financial 
services,  insurance,  and  telecommunications  enterprises.  How- 
ever, foreign  investors  could  obtain  majority  ownership  of  cer- 
tain activities  by  means  of  a  fideicomiso,  or  trust. 

In  November  1993,  the  government  announced  a  new  for- 
eign-investment law  that  vastly  expanded  foreign-investment 
opportunities  in  Mexico.  The  new  law  replaced  Mexico's  pro- 
tectionist 1973  investment  code  and  united  numerous  regula- 
tory changes  that  Salinas  previously  had  imposed  by  decree 
without  congressional  approval.  The  new  law  allowed  foreign- 
ers to  invest  directly  in  industrial,  commercial,  hotel,  and  time- 
share  developments  along  Mexico's  coast  and  borders, 
although  such  investment  had  to  be  carried  out  through  Mexi- 
can companies.  Foreigners  previously  had  been  prohibited 
from  owning  property  within  fifty  kilometers  of  Mexico's  bor- 
ders, and  their  investments  in  areas  beyond  fifty  kilometers  had 
to  be  carried  out  through  bank  trusts.  In  practice,  however,  for- 
eigners already  had  invested  in  many  of  the  listed  border  indus- 
tries and  areas  through  complex  trust  and  stock  ownership 
arrangements,  although  risk  and  bureaucratic  requirements 
had  deterred  some  potential  investors  and  financiers. 

The  new  investment  code  also  opened  the  air  transportation 
sector  to  25  percent  direct  foreign  investment  and  the  second- 
ary petrochemical  sector  to  full  100  percent  direct  foreign 
investment.  Mining  also  was  opened  to  100  percent  direct  for- 
eign ownership;  previously  foreigners  could  provide  100  per- 


226

cent  investment  but  had  to  invest  through  bank  trusts  for 
limited  periods  of  time.  Other  sectors  opened  to  foreign  inves- 
tors included  railroad-related  services,  ports,  farmland,  courier 
services,  and  cross-border  cargo  transport.  The  new  code  elimi- 
nated performance  requirements  previously  imposed  upon 
foreign  investors,  along  with  minimum  domestic  content 
requirements. 

The  Future  of  the  Economy 

The  market-oriented  structural  reforms  of  the  1980s  and 
early  1990s  transformed  Mexico's  economy  from  a  highly  pro- 
tectionist, public-sector-dominated  system  to  a  generally  open, 
deregulated  "emerging  market."  President  Salinas's  moves  to 
privatize  and  deregulate  large  sectors  of  the  Mexican  economy 
elicited  widespread  support  from  international  investors  and 
the  advanced  industrial  nations.  With  its  positive  effect  on 
trade  and  capital  flows,  NAFTA  was  widely  interpreted  by  Mexi- 
can decision  makers  as  a  validation  of  their  market-oriented 
economic  policies.  The  currency  collapse  of  December  1994 
and  the  ensuing  deep  recession,  however,  erased  the  economic 
gains  that  Mexico  had  achieved  in  previous  years,  shook  the 
nation's  political  stability,  and  depressed  hopes  for  an  early 
return  to  growth. 

Although  Mexico  remained  in  a  difficult  economic  condi- 
tion in  mid-1996,  the  worst  of  the  recession  had  passed  and  the 
country  appeared  headed  toward  recovery.  The  economy  regis- 
tered positive  growth  in  the  second  quarter  of  1996,  inflation 
and  interest  rates  abated,  and  portfolio  investment  returned,  as 
reflected  in  Mexico's  rising  stock  exchange  index.  Despite  con- 
tinuing problems  exacerbated  by  low  investor  confidence,  ana- 
lysts agreed  that  Mexico's  economy  in  the  mid-1990s  was 
fundamentally  sound  and  capable  of  long-term  expansion.

Chapter  4.  Government  and  Politics 


A  representation  of  the  Mexican  coat  of  arms — an  eagle  standing  on  a  cactus, 
with  a  snake  in  its  mouth — -from  a  painting  by  Diego  Rivera 


FOR  MORE  THAN  THREE  GENERATIONS,  Mexicans  have 
attributed  the  origins  of  their  political  system  to  the  Revolution 
of  1910-20.  They  cite  the  constitution  of  1917,  a  sweeping  doc- 
ument that  capped  nearly  a  decade  of  civil  war  among  rival 
regional  militias,  as  the  foundation  of  their  modern  political 
institutions  and  practices.  Mexico's  governing  institutions  and 
political  culture  also  bear  the  imprint  of  three  centuries  of 
Spanish  colonial  rule.  Mexicans'  adherence  to  a  highly  codi- 
fied civil  law  tradition,  their  acceptance  of  heavy  state  involve- 
ment in  business  and  civic  affairs,  and  the  deference  accorded 
the  executive  over  other  branches  of  government  can  be  traced 
to  the  administrative  and  legal  practices  of  the  colonial  period. 
Finally,  the  traumatic  experiences  of  the  nineteenth  century, 
including  foreign  military  occupations  and  the  loss  of  half  of 
the  national  territory  to  the  United  States,  as  well  as  the  disillu- 
sion sown  by  a  series  of  unconstitutional  regimes,  continue  to 
have  a  profound  impact  on  contemporary  political  culture. 

During  the  1920s,  President  Plutarco  Ellas  Calles  (1924-28) 
reorganized  Mexican  politics  along  corporatist  (see  Glossary) 
lines  as  a  way  to  contain  latent  social  conflicts.  Calles  expanded 
the  government  bureaucracy  to  enable  it  to  mediate  among 
rival  constituencies  and  to  dispense  state  funds  to  organizations 
supportive  of  the  "official"  party.  Calles  also  created  new 
umbrella  organizations  that  lumped  together  disparate  groups 
according  to  broad  functional  categories.  The  newly  created 
interest  groups  depended  heavily  on  the  state  for  their  financ- 
ing and  were  required  to  maintain  strong  ties  to  the  ruling 
party.  By  grafting  corporatist  institutions  onto  Mexico's  histori- 
cally fractious  political  system  at  a  time  when  ideologies  of  the 
extreme  left  and  right  were  gaining  support  throughout  the 
world,  Mexico's  leaders  avoided  a  return  to  the  widespread  vio- 
lence that  had  engulfed  their  country  during  the  1910s  and 
early  1920s.  Subsequently,  the  relatively  inclusive  nature  of 
Mexican  corporatism  and  the  firm  foundations  of  civilian 
supremacy  over  the  military  prevented  Mexico  from  following 
the  pattern  of  alternating  civilian  and  military  regimes  that 
characterized  most  other  Latin  American  countries  in  the 
twentieth  century. 

One  of  Calles's  successors,  Lazaro  Cardenas  (1934-40), 
revived  populism  as  a  force  in  national  politics  by  redistribut- 


231

ing  land  to  landless  peasants  under  a  state-sponsored  reincar- 
nation of  communal  farming  known  as  the  ejido  (see  Glossary) 
system.  Cardenas  also  emphasized  nationalism  as  a  force  in 
Mexican  politics  by  expropriating  the  holdings  of  foreign  oil 
corporations  and  creating  a  new  national  oil  company  Carde- 
nas's  reforms  of  the  late  1930s  bolstered  the  legitimacy  of  the 
government  while  further  concentrating  power  in  the  presi- 
dent and  the  Institutional  Revolutionary  Party  (Partido  Revolu- 
cionario  Institucional — PRI),  the  "official"  party  of  the 
Revolution.  By  the  early  1940s,  the  political  processes  and  insti- 
tutions that  would  broadly  define  Mexican  politics  for  the  next 
forty  years  were  well  established:  a  strong  federal  government 
dominated  by  a  civilian  president  and  his  loyalists  within  the 
ruling  party,  a  symbiotic  relationship  between  the  state  and  the 
official  party,  a  regular  and  orderly  rotation  of  power  among 
rival  factions  within  a  de  facto  single-party  system,  and  a  highly 
structured  corporatist  relationship  between  the  state  and  gov- 
ernment-sponsored constituent  groups. 

During  the  financial  crisis  of  the  1980s,  the  stable,  ritualistic 
pattern  of  Mexican  politics  instituted  by  Calles  and  Cardenas 
began  to  break  down.  As  public  funding  for  a  variety  of  pro- 
grams dried  up,  the  state's  role  in  the  economy  was  scaled  back, 
and  the  clientelist  relationships  developed  over  four  decades 
between  government  agencies  and  legally  recognized  constitu- 
ent groups  were  weakened.  Seeking  to  establish  a  basis  for 
future  economic  growth,  the  governments  of  Miguel  de  la 
Madrid  Hurtado  (1982-88)  and  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari 
(1988-94)  carried  out  a  structural  adjustment  program  that 
systematically  rolled  back  state  ownership  and  regulation  of  key 
industries.  They  also  eliminated  long-standing  protectionist 
legislation  that  had  made  Mexico  one  of  the  most  closed  econ- 
omies in  the  world  and  lifted  the  constitutional  prohibition  on 
the  sale  of  ejido  land  to  allow  it  to  be  converted  to  larger,  more 
efficient  farms.  In  the  mid-1980s,  an  internal  rift  emerged 
between  the  populist  and  the  more  technocratic  wings  of  the 
ruling  party  over  the  market  reforms  and  the  authoritarian 
nature  of  the  PRI-dominated  political  system.  The  economic 
reforms  initiated  by  President  de  la  Madrid  had  been  opposed 
by  many  members  of  the  PRI's  core  agrarian  and  labor  constit- 
uencies. These  groups  rejected  privatization  and  the  elimina- 
tion of  economic  subsidies  for  consumer  goods  and  services. 
The  naming  of  Salinas,  a  United  States-educated  technocrat,  as 
de  la  Madrid's  successor  was  also  repudiated  by  the  leftist  fac- 


232 


Government  and  Politics 


tion  of  the  PRI  leadership.  This  internal  rift  developed  into  the 
first  major  mass  defection  from  the  PRI  ranks  when  Cuauhte- 
moc Cardenas  Solorzano,  son  of  the  former  president,  left  the 
party  to  contest  the  1988  presidential  election  as  head  of  a  coa- 
lition of  leftist  parties. 

Since  the  late  1980s,  the  PRI  has  defeated  serious  electoral 
challenges  to  its  central  role  in  Mexican  politics  from  parties  of 
the  left  and  right.  During  his  presidency,  Salinas  liberalized  the 
electoral  system  but  further  concentrated  power  in  the  execu- 
tive. The  main  objectives  of  the  Salinas  administration  were  to 
restructure  the  Mexican  economy  and  to  integrate  Mexico  into 
the  global  market,  rather  than  to  democratize  the  political  sys- 
tem. Nevertheless,  the  electoral  reforms  enacted  by  Salinas 
under  domestic  and  international  pressure  for  democratiza- 
tion set  the  stage  for  competitive,  internationally  monitored 
presidential  and  congressional  elections  in  1994. 

After  a  strongly  contested  presidential  campaign  marred  by 
the  assassination  of  its  original  candidate,  the  PRI  maintained 
its  hold  on  the  presidency  with  the  election  of  yet  another 
United  States-educated  technocrat,  Ernesto  Zedillo  Ponce  de 
Leon,  in  August  1994.  Zedillo's  victory  preserved  the  PRI's 
dubious  distinction  as  the  world's  longest-ruling  political  party. 
The  PRI  victory  also  presented  Zedillo  and  his  party  with  the 
unenviable  challenge  of  guiding  Mexico  through  a  difficult 
and  uncertain  period  of  economic  dislocation  and  broad  polit- 
ical realignments.  By  the  mid-1990s,  most  observers  believed 
that  the  PRI-dominated  political  system  begun  in  the  1920s  was 
in  an  advanced  state  of  decay  and  that  a  transitional  period 
marked  by  a  greater  pluralism  of  organized  political  activity  was 
at  hand.  How  this  transition  would  unfold,  and  whether  it 
would  ultimately  lead  to  a  more  participatory  and  competitive 
political  process  across  the  spectrum  of  Mexican  society,  was 
yet  to  be  determined. 

Constitutional  History 

Nineteenth-Century  Constitutions 

The  roots  of  the  Mexican  republic  can  be  traced  to  two  doc- 
uments drafted  during  the  early  independence  struggle  against 
Spain:  Los  sentimientos  de  la  nacion  (1813),  by  Jose  Maria  More- 
los  y  Pavon,  and  the  Constitution  of  Apatzingan  (1814).  These 
tracts  introduced  the  ideal  of  a  republic  based  on  liberal  politi- 
cal institutions  and  respect  for  individual  rights.  Mexico's  inde-

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

pendence  was  attained,  however,  by  an  alliance  of  liberal  and 
ultraconservative  forces  under  the  leadership  of  Agustm  de 
Iturbide  (see  Wars  of  Independence,  1810-21,  ch.  1).  Iturbide's 
Plan  of  Iguala  proposed  an  indigenous  constitutional  monar- 
chy, rather  than  a  republic,  as  the  alternative  to  Spanish  rule. 
By  assuming  imperial  powers  following  the  victory  over  Spanish 
colonial  forces  in  1821,  Iturbide  continued  the  Iberian  practice 
of  plenipotentiary  rule  by  the  chief  executive. 

Mexico's  first  republican  constitution  was  the  Acta  Constitu- 
tiva  de  la  Federacion  Mexicana  (Constituent  Act  of  the  Mexi- 
can Federation),  which  was  promulgated  in  1824,  following  the 
forced  resignation  of  Iturbide  and  the  breakup  of  the  short- 
lived Mexican  Empire  (see  The  Abortive  Empire,  1821-23,  ch. 
1).  A  liberal  document  modeled  largely  on  the  United  States 
constitution,  the  constitution  of  1824  established  a  federal 
republic  with  a  divided  central  government.  To  avoid  the 
abuses  of  executive  authority  experienced  under  Iturbide,  the 
constitution  required  the  president  to  share  power  and  respon- 
sibility with  a  bicameral  congress  and  the  federal  judiciary. 
Breaking  with  the  Spanish  colonial  legacy  of  centralism,  the 
constitution  instituted  a  strong  federal  system,  wherein  presi- 
dents were  to  be  indirectly  elected  every  four  years  by  a  simple 
majority  vote  of  the  republic's  nineteen  state  legislatures. 

A  document  of  dubious  relevance,  the  constitution  of  1824 
was  never  fully  observed  by  the  politico-military  leadership  of 
the  early  Mexican  republic.  The  survival  of  two  of  its  most 
important  principles,  federalism  and  congressional  authority, 
was  more  a  reflection  of  the  de  facto  decentralization  of  power 
in  early  nineteenth-century  Mexico  than  of  a  generalized 
observance  of  the  rule  of  law.  Many  provisions  of  the  constitu- 
tion of  1824  and  subsequent  nineteenth-century  constitutions 
were  simply  ignored  by  the  combative  regional  caudillos 
(strongmen)  who  dominated  national  politics.  The  most  com- 
monly breached  constitutional  principle  was  that  of  an  orderly, 
electoral  process  of  presidential  succession.  The  violent  over- 
throw of  governments  and  the  perpetuation  in  office  of  power- 
ful presidents  were  problems  that  would  plague  Mexico 
throughout  the  rest  of  the  nineteenth  century  and  into  the  rev- 
olutionary period.  Between  1824  and  1857,  only  one  president, 
Guadalupe  Victoria,  completed  his  term  and  handed  over 
power  to  an  elected  successor  (see  Centralism  and  the  Caudillo 
State,  1836-55,  ch.  1). 


234 


Government  and  Politics 


In  1833  the  conservative  president  and  military  caudillo, 
Antonio  Lopez  de  Santa  Anna  Perez  de  Lebron,  suspended  the 
1824  constitution  and  imposed  a  new  national  charter  known 
as  the  Siete  Leyes  (Seven  Laws).  The  Siete  Leyes  was  a  reaction- 
ary document  that  strengthened  the  powers  of  the  presidency, 
militarized  the  federal  government,  and  raised  property  quali- 
fications for  voting. 

After  three  decades  of  political  instability  stemming  from 
unrestrained  power  struggles  between  liberal  and  conservative 
elites,  a  new  reformist  constitution  was  promulgated  in  1857  by 
the  liberals,  who  had  gained  the  upper  hand.  The  1857  consti- 
tution was  reminiscent  of  the  1824  charter  but  was  noteworthy 
for  its  introduction  of  major  reform  laws  restricting  military 
and  clerical  fueros  (privileges)  and  clerical  property  rights.  The 
new  constitution  also  introduced  a  bill  of  rights,  abolished  sla- 
very, and  reestablished  a  strong  national  congress  as  a  unicam- 
eral body.  The  clerical  reform  laws,  moderate  in  comparison  to 
the  strongly  anticlerical  constitution  of  1917,  nevertheless  gal- 
vanized the  conservative  opposition  and  led  to  a  three-year  civil 
war.  Although  the  liberal  forces  under  President  Benito  Juarez 
eventually  prevailed,  the  conflict  left  Mexico  divided  and 
deeply  in  debt. 

Using  the  excuse  of  collecting  compensation  for  damage 
incurred  during  the  civil  war,  the  French  landed  troops  in  Ver- 
acruz. The  French  government,  hoping  to  reestablish  a  French 
empire  in  the  Americas,  allied  itself  with  conservative  and 
church  forces  in  Mexico  and  sent  French  troops  to  take  Mexico 
City  (see  Civil  War  and  the  French  Intervention,  ch.  1).  French 
troops  entered  the  capital  in  1863,  and  an  empire  under  the 
Austrian  archduke  Ferdinand  Maximilian  Joseph  von  Habs- 
burg  was  declared.  Republican  forces  retreated  to  the  far 
north,  and  for  four  years  Mexico  had  two  governments. 

Bowing  to  pressure  from  the  United  States  and  responding 
to  the  increased  belligerency  of  Prussia,  Napoleon  III  of  France 
decided  to  withdraw  French  troops  at  the  end  of  1866.  The 
conservative  forces  in  Mexico,  disillusioned  by  Maximilian, 
threw  their  support  to  Juarez.  Before  the  last  French  troops 
had  boarded  their  ships  in  Veracruz,  Maximilian  had  surren- 
dered, and  the  republican  forces  again  controlled  the  entire 
country. 

Although  the  constitution  of  1857  was  restored,  its  demo- 
cratic principles  were  increasingly  violated  in  the  decades  to 
follow.  Juarez  was  reelected  twice  amidst  charges  that  his 


235 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

administrations  were  becoming  increasingly  dictatorial.  After 
Juarez's  death  in  1872,  Sebastian  Lerdo  de  Tejada  assumed  the 
presidency.  Under  Lerdo,  a  bicameral  congress  was  reinstated. 
When  Lerdo  announced  he  would  run  for  reelection  in  1876, 
Jose  de  la  Cruz  Porfirio  Diaz  took  control  as  dictator.  For  more 
than  a  third  of  a  century,  either  directly  of  indirectly,  Diaz 
ruled  Mexico  (see  The  Porfiriato,  ch.  1). 

The  revolutionary  years  from  1910  to  1917  were  a  period  of 
governmental  chaos  (see  The  Revolution,  1910-20,  ch.  1).  Var- 
ious groups  espousing  populist  and  revolutionary  ideals 
roamed  the  country.  By  1917  forces  under  Venustiano 
Garranza  gradually  had  consolidated  their  control  of  the 
nation.  Carranza  then  called  a  constitutional  convention  and 
presented  a  draft  constitution,  similar  to  the  constitution  of 
1857,  to  the  delegates.  Carranza's  moderate  faction  was  out- 
numbered by  the  radicals,  however,  and  numerous  anticlerical 
and  social  reform  articles  were  added. 

Constitution  of  1 91 7 

The  constitution  of  1917,  proclaimed  on  February  5,  1917, 
is  considered  by  many  to  be  one  of  the  most  radical  and  com- 
prehensive constitutions  in  modern  political  history.  Although 
its  social  content  gave  it  the  title  of  the  first  modern  socialist 
constitution — it  preceded  the  constitution  of  the  former  Soviet 
Union — the  Mexican  document  replicates  many  liberal  princi- 
ples and  concepts  of  the  constitution  of  the  United  States.  The 
liberal  concepts  include  federalism,  separation  of  powers,  and 
a  bill  of  rights.  In  addition  to  reaffirming  the  liberal  principles 
of  the  nineteenth-century  documents,  the  1917  constitution 
adds  a  strong  nationalist  proclamation,  asserting  Mexico's  con- 
trol over  its  natural  resources.  It  also  recognizes  social  and 
labor  rights,  separation  of  church  and  state,  and  universal  male 
suffrage.  Reflecting  the  varied  social  backgrounds  and  political 
philosophies  of  its  framers,  the  constitution  of  1917  includes 
various  contradictory  provisions,  endorsing  within  the  same 
text  socialism,  capitalism,  liberal  democracy,  authoritarian  cor- 
poratism, and  a  host  of  unimplemented  provisions  for  specific 
social  reforms. 

Formally,  the  constitution  prescribes  a  federal  republic  con- 
sisting of  thirty-one  states  and  a  federal  district.  The  federal 
government  is  divided  into  executive,  legislative,  and  judicial 
branches,  but  these  branches  do  not  have  comparable  powers. 
Only  the  president  may  promulgate  a  law,  by  signing  it  and 


236 


Government  and  Politics 


ordering  its  publication.  The  executive  can  veto  bills  passed  by 
the  legislature,  either  in  whole  or  by  item,  and  although  a  veto 
may  be  overridden,  there  is  no  constitutional  way  in  which  the 
president  may  be  forced  to  sign  a  bill  into  law.  In  addition, 
executive-sponsored  bills  submitted  to  the  Congress  take  prece- 
dence over  other  business,  and  the  constitution  gives  the  presi- 
dent broad  authority  to  issue  basic  rules  (reglamentos) . 
Reglamentos  have  the  same  legal  force  as  laws  and  are  the  source 
of  most  statutory  regulations. 

The  constitution  treats  many  matters  of  public  policy  explic- 
itly. For  example,  before  being  amended  in  1992,  Article  27 
placed  stringent  restrictions  on  the  ownership  of  property  by 
foreigners  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  declared 
national  ownership  of  the  country's  natural  resources  (see 
Church-State  Relations,  ch.  2).  Religious  groups  were  excluded 
from  any  kind  of  political  activity  and  were  not  allowed  to  par- 
ticipate in  public  education,  conduct  services  outside 
churches,  or  wear  clerical  dress  in  public.  In  its  original  form, 
Article  27  also  granted  the  government  broad  powers  to  expro- 
priate private  property  in  the  public  interest  and  to  redistribute 
land. 

The  constitution  prescribes  an  activist  state  that  will  ensure 
national  autonomy  and  social  justice.  Thus,  in  addition  to  a 
charter  of  individual  rights,  the  constitution  provides  for  a 
number  of  social  rights  for  workers  and  peasants  and  their 
organizations.  In  Article  123,  the  constitution  provides  what 
has  been  described  as  "the  most  advanced  labor  code  in  the 
world  at  its  time."  It  guarantees  the  right  to  organize,  as  well  as 
an  eight-hour  workday,  and  provides  for  the  protection  of 
women  and  minors  in  the  workplace.  It  mandates  that  the  min- 
imum wage  "should  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  normal  necessi- 
ties of  life  of  the  worker,"  and  establishes  the  principle  of  equal 
pay  for  equal  work  regardless  of  gender,  race,  or  ethnicity.  In 
addition,  Article  123  clarifies  the  right  to  strike.  Strikes  are 
legal  when  their  purpose  is  to  "establish  equilibrium  between 
the  diverse  factors  of  production,  harmonizing  the  rights  of 
labor  with  those  of  capital."  The  article  further  establishes  arbi- 
tration and  conciliation  boards  made  up  of  equal  numbers  of 
management,  labor  representatives,  and  one  government  rep- 
resentative. Although  many  of  these  provisions  were  not  imple- 
mented until  1931,  Article  123  mandates  the  incorporation  of 
organized  labor  into  the  formal  political  process  and  serves  as 


237 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

a  basis  for  labor's  claim  to  a  preeminent  status  in  national  poli- 
tics. 

Government  Structure 

Executive 

The  presidency  is  the  paramount  institution,  not  only  of  the 
Mexican  state,  but  of  the  entire  Mexican  political  system.  Crit- 
ics have  pejoratively  labeled  the  presidency  the  "six-year  mon- 
archy" because  of  the  seemingly  unchecked  power  that 
historically  has  resided  in  the  office.  Much  of  the  aura  of  presi- 
dential power  derives  from  the  president's  direct  and  unchal- 
lenged control  over  both  the  state  apparatus  and  the  ruling 
political  party,  the  PRI. 

Presidents  are  directly  elected  by  a  simple  majority  of  regis- 
tered voters  in  the  thirty-one  states  and  the  Federal  District. 
The  president  holds  the  formal  titles  of  chief  of  state,  head  of 
government,  and  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces  (see 
fig.  11).  Presidential  candidates  must  be  at  least  thirty-five  years 
old  on  election  day  and  must  be  not  only  Mexican  citizens  by 
birth  but  also  the  offspring  of  Mexican  citizens  by  birth  (this 
clause  was  amended  in  1994  to  make  the  children  of  natural- 
ized citizens  eligible  for  the  presidency,  effective  in  1999).  To 
be  eligible  for  the  presidency,  a  candidate  must  reside  legally  in 
Mexico  during  the  year  preceding  the  election.  The  candidate 
cannot  have  held  a  cabinet  post  or  a  governorship,  nor  have 
been  on  active  military  duty  during  the  six  months  prior  to  the 
election.  Priests  and  ministers  of  religious  denominations  are 
barred  from  holding  public  office. 

The  presidential  term  of  six  years,  commonly  known  as  the 
sexenio,  has  determined  the  cyclical  character  of  Mexican  poli- 
tics since  the  late  1930s.  A  president  can  never  be  reelected, 
and  there  is  no  vice  president.  If  the  presidential  office  falls 
vacant  during  the  first  two  years  of  a  sexenio,  the  congress  desig- 
nates an  interim  president,  who,  in  turn,  must  call  a  special 
presidential  election  to  complete  the  term.  If  the  vacancy 
occurs  during  the  latter  four  years  of  a  sexenio,  the  congress  des- 
ignates a  provisional  president  for  the  remainder  of  the  term. 

In  addition  to  the  president's  prerogatives  in  legislative  mat- 
ters, he  or  she  may  freely  appoint  and  dismiss  cabinet  officials 
and  almost  all  employees  of  the  executive  branch.  Subject  to 
traditionally  routine  ratification  by  the  Senate,  the  president 
appoints  ambassadors,  consuls  general,  magistrates  of  the 


238 


Government  and  Politics 


Supreme  Court,  and  the  mayor  of  the  Federal  District.  The 
president  also  appoints  the  magistrates  of  the  Supreme  Court 
of  the  Federal  District,  subject  to  ratification  by  the  Chamber 
of  Deputies.  Presidential  appointment  authority  also  extends 
downward  through  the  federal  bureaucracy  to  a  wide  assort- 
ment of  midlevel  offices  in  the  secretariats,  other  cabinet-level 
agencies,  semiautonomous  agencies,  and  parastatal  (see  Glos- 
sary) enterprises.  This  extensive  appointment  authority  pro- 
vides a  formidable  source  of  patronage  for  incoming 
administrations  and  has  been  an  important  factor  in  ensuring 
the  regular,  orderly  turnover  in  office  of  competing  elite  fac- 
tions within  the  official  party. 

Despite  the  nominally  federal  character  of  the  Mexican 
state,  presidents  have  historically  played  a  decisive  role  in  the 
selection  and  removal  of  state  governors,  all  of  whom,  until 
1991,  were  members  of  the  PRI.  President  Salinas  was  particu- 
larly assertive  in  bringing  about  the  resignations  of  PRI  gover- 
nors widely  believed  to  have  been  elected  through  blatant 
fraud.  In  some  cases,  Salinas  annuled  the  election  and 
appointed  the  opposition  candidate  governor. 

The  president  confers  broad  powers  on  cabinet  secretaries, 
although  the  cabinet  rarely  meets  as  a  single  body.  There  is  a 
hierarchy  of  influence  among  the  different  cabinet  posts,  and 
the  power  of  a  minister  or  secretary  varies,  depending  on  the 
priorities  set  by  a  particular  president  as  well  as  the  resources 
available  at  the  time.  Traditionally,  the  secretary  of  interior  has 
been  an  influential  figure  and  often  has  been  chosen  to  suc- 
ceed the  president.  During  the  Jose  Lopez  Portillo  y  Pachecho 
sexenio  (1976-82),  the  Secretariat  of  Programming  and  Budget 
(Secretaria  de  Programacion  y  Presupuesto — SPP)  was  reorga- 
nized to  coordinate  all  government  agencies,  supervise  the 
budget,  and  design  the  national  development  program.  Until 
its  merger  with  the  Secretariat  of  Finance  and  Public  Credit 
(Secretana  de  Hacienda  y  Credito  Publico)  in  1992,  the  SPP 
was  extremely  influential,  becoming  the  launching  point  for 
the  presidencies  of  de  la  Madrid  and  Salinas. 

In  1994,  President  Salinas  broke  with  the  pattern  of  selecting 
SPP  economists  by  designating  the  Secretary  of  Social  Develop- 
ment, Luis  Donaldo  Colosio  Murrieta,  as  the  PRI  presidential 
nominee.  This  departure  from  the  established  practice  of  nom- 
inating ministers  with  economic  portfolios  appeared  to  reflect 
a  reemergence  of  a  social  welfare  agenda  within  the  PRI  after 
years  of  orthodox  economic  policies.  When  Colosio  was  assassi-

nated  during  the  presidential  campaign,  Salinas  returned  to 
the  fold  by  selecting  Zedillo,  a  former  education  and  SPP  secre- 
tary who  was  then  serving  as  Colosio's  campaign  manager,  to 
replace  the  fallen  candidate. 

One  of  the  unique  features  of  the  Mexican  presidency  has 
been  the  highly  secretive  and  mysterious  process  of  presiden- 
tial succession.  Since  the  1930s,  Mexico's  PRI  presidents  have 
enjoyed  the  right  to  personally  name  their  successor,  a  privi- 
lege known  as  the  dedazo  (tap).  The  prerogative  of  choosing 
one's  successor  has  allowed  outgoing  presidents  to  select  indi- 
viduals who  embody  either  change  or  continuity  with  past  poli- 
cies, as  demanded  by  circumstances  and  public  opinion.  Over 
the  years,  the  skillful  selection  of  a  successor  to  the  president 
has  become  an  important  element  of  the  adaptability  that  has 
characterized  the  PRI-dominated  system. 

During  the  last  two  years  of  a  sexenio,  a  president  selects  a 
short  list  of  candidates  for  the  PRI  nomination  from  among  an 
inner  circle  within  the  cabinet.  Before  announcing  the  nomi- 
nee, an  event  known  as  the  destape  (unveiling),  a  president 
gauges  public  opinion  of  the  candidates.  The  destape  has  been 
criticized  for  being  undemocratic  and  anachronistic  in  the  age 
of  mass  communications.  Beginning  with  the  elections  of  2000, 
the  PRI's  presidential  candidate  will  be  selected  by  a  nominat- 
ing convention,  similar  to  that  followed  by  the  other  major  par- 
ties. 

Legislative 

The  legislative  branch  of  the  Mexican  government  consists 
of  a  bicameral  congress  (Congreso  de  la  Union)  divided  into 
an  upper  chamber,  or  Senate  (Camara  de  Senadores),  and  a 
lower  chamber,  or  Chamber  of  Deputies  (Camara  de  Diputa- 
dos).  As  in  the  United  States,  both  chambers  are  responsible 
for  the  discussion  and  approval  of  legislation  and  the  ratifica- 
tion of  high-level  presidential  appointments.  In  theory,  the 
power  of  introducing  bills  is  shared  with  the  executive, 
although  in  practice  the  executive  initiates  about  90  percent  of 
all  legislation. 

The  congress  holds  two  ordinary  sessions  per  year.  The  first 
session  begins  on  November  1  and  continues  until  no  later 
than  December  31;  the  second  session  begins  on  April  15  and 
may  continue  until  July  15.  A  Permanent  Committee 
(Comision  Permanente),  consisting  of  thirty-seven  members 
(eighteen  senators  and  nineteen  deputies),  assumes  legislative 


241 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

responsibilities  during  congressional  recesses.  The  president 
may  call  for  extraordinary  sessions  of  congress  to  deal  with 
important  legislation. 

Historically,  the  Senate  consisted  of  sixty-four  members,  two 
members  for  each  state  and  two  representing  the  Federal  Dis- 
trict elected  by  direct  vote  for  six-year  terms.  However,  as  part 
of  the  electoral  reforms  enacted  by  the  Salinas  government  in 
1993,  the  Senate  was  doubled  in  size  to  128  members,  with  one 
of  each  state's  four  seats  going  to  whichever  party  comes  in  sec- 
ond in  that  state.  Since  1986  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  has  con- 
sisted of  500  members,  200  of  whom  are  elected  by 
proportional  representation  from  among  large  plurinominal 
districts,  and  the  remainder  from  single-member  districts. 
Members  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  serve  three-year  terms. 
All  members  of  the  congress  are  barred  from  immediate 
reelection  but  may  serve  nonconsecutive  terms. 

The  powers  of  the  congress  include  the  right  to  pass  laws, 
impose  taxes,  declare  war,  approve  the  national  budget, 
approve  or  reject  treaties  and  conventions  made  with  foreign 
countries,  and  ratify  diplomatic  appointments.  The  Senate 
addresses  all  matters  concerning  foreign  policy,  approves  inter- 
national agreements,  and  confirms  presidential  appointments. 
The  Chamber  of  Deputies,  much  like  the  United  States  House 
of  Representatives,  addresses  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  gov- 
ernment's budget  and  public  expenditures.  As  in  the  United 
States,  in  cases  of  impeachment,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  has 
the  power  to  prosecute,  and  the  Senate  acts  as  the  jury.  In  some 
instances,  both  chambers  share  certain  powers,  such  as  estab- 
lishing committees  to  discuss  particular  government  issues  and 
question  government  officials.  The  deputies  have  the  power  to 
appoint  a  provisional  president.  In  the  event  of  impeachment, 
the  two  chambers  are  convened  jointly  as  a  General  Congress. 
Each  legislative  chamber  has  a  number  of  committees  that 
study  and  recommend  bills.  If  there  is  disagreement  between 
the  chambers,  a  joint  committee  is  appointed  to  draft  a  com- 
promise version. 

Judicial 

The  judicial  branch  of  the  Mexican  government  is  divided 
into  federal  and  state  systems.  Mexico's  highest  court  is  the 
Supreme  Court  of  Justice,  located  in  Mexico  City.  It  consists  of 
twenty-one  magistrates  and  five  auxiliary  judges,  all  appointed

by  the  president  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate  or  the  Perma- 
nent Committee. 

Mexican  supreme  court  justices  must  be  Mexican  citizens  by 
birth,  thirty-five  to  sixty-five  years  old,  and  must  have  resided  in 
Mexico  and  held  a  law  degree  during  the  five  years  preceding 
their  nomination.  According  to  the  constitution,  supreme 
court  justices  are  appointed  for  life  but  are  subject  to  impeach- 
ment by  the  Chamber  of  Deputies.  In  practice,  the  justices, 
along  with  the  entire  federal  judiciary,  traditionally  submit 
their  resignations  at  the  beginning  of  each  sexenio. 

The  Supreme  Court  of Justice  may  meet  in  joint  session  or  in 
separate  chambers,  depending  on  the  type  of  case  before  it. 
The  high  court  is  divided  into  four  chambers,  each  with  five 
justices.  These  are  the  Penal  Affairs  Chamber,  Administrative 
Affairs  Chamber,  Civil  Affairs  Chamber,  and  Labor  Affairs 
Chamber.  A  fifth  chamber,  the  Auxiliary  Chamber,  is  responsi- 
ble for  the  overload  of  the  four  regular  chambers.  Court  rul- 
ings of  both  the  whole,  or  plenary,  court  and  the  separate 
chambers  are  decided  on  the  basis  of  majority  opinion.  Rulings 
by  the  separate  chambers  may  be  overturned  by  the  full  court.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


There  are  three  levels  of  federal  courts  under  the  Supreme 
Court  of  Justice:  twelve  Collegiate  Circuit  Courts,  each  with 
three  magistrates;  nine  Unitary  Circuit  Courts,  each  with  six 
magistrates;  and  sixty-eight  District  Courts,  each  with  one 
judge.  Federal  judges  for  the  lower  courts  are  appointed  by  the 
Supreme  Court  of  Justice.  The  Collegiate  Circuit  Courts  are 
comparable  to  the  United  States  Courts  of  Appeals.  The  Colle- 
giate Circuit  Courts  deal  with  the  protection  of  individual 
rights,  most  commonly  hearing  cases  where  an  individual  seeks 
a  writ  of  amparo,  a  category  of  legal  protection  comparable  to  a 
broad  form  of  habeas  corpus  that  safeguards  individual  civil 
liberties  and  property  rights.  The  Unitary  Circuit  Courts  also 
handle  appeals  cases.  The  Collegiate  Circuit  Courts  are  located 
in  Mexico  City,  Toluca,  Guadalajara,  Monterrey,  Hermosillo, 
Puebla,  Veracruz,  Torreon,  San  Luis  Potosf,  Villahermosa, 
Morelia,  and  Mazatlan.  The  Unitary  Circuit  Courts  are  located 
in  Mexico  City,  Toluca,  Guadalajara,  Monterrey,  Hermosillo, 
Puebla,  Merida,  Torreon,  and  Mazatlan. 

The  Mexican  legal  system  is  based  on  Spanish  civil  law  with 
some  influence  of  the  common  law  tradition.  Unlike  the 
United  States  version  of  the  common  law  system,  under  which 
the  judiciary  enjoys  broad  powers  of  jurisprudence,  Spanish 
civil  law  is  based  upon  strict  adherence  to  legal  codes  and  mini- 
mal jurisprudence.  The  most  powerful  juridical  instrument  is 
the  writ  of  amparo,  which  can  be  invoked  against  acts  by  any 
government  official,  including  the  president.  Unlike  the 
United  States  system,  where  courts  may  rule  on  basic  constitu- 
tional matters,  the  Mexican  Supreme  Court  of  Justice  is  prohib- 
ited by  the  constitution  from  applying  its  rulings  beyond  any 
individual  case.  Within  this  restricted  sphere,  the  Supreme 
Court  of  Justice  generally  displays  greater  independence  in 
relation  to  the  president  than  does  the  legislature,  often  decid- 
ing against  the  executive  in  amparo  cases.  Nevertheless,  the 
judiciary  seldom  attempts  to  thwart  the  will  of  the  president  on 
major  issues. 

State  Government 

Mexico  is  divided  into  thirty-one  states  and  a  Federal  District 
that  encompasses  Mexico  City  and  its  immediate  environs. 
Each  state  has  its  own  constitution,  modeled  on  the  national 
charter,  with  the  right  to  legislate  and  levy  taxes  other  than 
interstate  customs  duties.  Following  the  federal  organization  at 
the  national  level,  state  (and  local)  governments  also  have

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

executive,  legislative,  and  judicial  branches.  Despite  its  federal 
structure,  Mexico's  political  system  is  highly  centralized.  State 
governments  depend  on  Mexico  City  for  much  of  their  reve- 
nue, which  they,  in  turn,  funnel  to  municipal  governments  in  a 
clientelist  fashion.  Mexican  presidents  have  historically  played 
a  prominent  role  in  selecting  PRI  gubernatorial  candidates  and 
in  settling  state-level  electoral  disputes.  President  Salinas  was 
especially  assertive  in  this  regard,  having  removed  or  prevented 
the  seating  of  eight  PRI  governors  widely  believed  to  have  been 
fraudulently  elected. 

The  state  executive  branch  is  headed  by  a  governor,  who  is 
directly  elected  by  simple  majority  vote  for  a  six-year  term,  and, 
like  the  president,  may  not  be  reelected.  State  legislatures  are 
unicameral,  consisting  of  a  single  Chamber  of  Deputies  that 
meets  in  two  ordinary  sessions  per  year,  with  extended  periods 
and  extraordinary  sessions  when  needed.  Deputies  serve  three- 
year  terms  and  may  not  be  immediately  reelected.  Legislative 
bills  may  be  introduced  by  the  deputies,  the  state  governor,  the 
state  Superior  Court  of  Justice,  or  by  a  municipality  within  a 
given  state.  Replicating  the  pattern  of  executive  dominance  at 
the  national  level,  most  policy-making  authority  at  the  state 
level  has  historically  resided  in  the  governor.  The  state  judi- 
ciary is  headed  by  a  Superior  Court  of  Justice.  Justices  of  the 
Superior  Courts  of  Justice  are  appointed  by  governors  with 
approval  of  the  state  legislatures.  The  superior  court  magis- 
trates, in  turn,  appoint  all  lower  state  court  judges. 

The  Federal  District,  which  encompasses  Mexico  City  and  its 
southern  suburbs,  has  traditionally  fallen  under  the  supervi- 
sion of  the  president,  who  appoints  a  mayor  (regente).  In  addi- 
tion to  performing  his  municipal  duties,  the  mayor  also  holds 
cabinet  rank  as  head  of  the  Department  of  the  Federal  District. 
In  September  1993,  the  congress  approved  an  electoral  reform 
package  that  introduced  the  indirect  election  of  the  mayor  of 
the  Federal  District. 

The  Federal  District  has  local  courts  and  a  Representative 
Assembly,  whose  members  are  elected  by  proportional  repre- 
sentation. The  assembly,  historically  a  local  advisory  body  with 
no  real  legislative  power,  is  scheduled  to  elect  Federal  District 
mayors  beginning  in  late  1996. 

Local  Government 

The  basic  unit  of  Mexican  government  is  the  municipality 
(municipio) ,  more  than  2,000  of  which  were  legally  in  existence 


246 


Government  and  Politics 


in  1996.  Municipal  governments  are  responsible  for  a  variety  of 
public  services,  including  water  and  sewerage;  street  lighting; 
cleaning  and  maintenance;  public  safety  and  traffic;  supervi- 
sion of  slaughterhouses;  and  the  maintenance  of  parks,  gar- 
dens, and  cemeteries.  Municipalities  are  also  free  to  assist  state 
and  federal  governments  in  the  provision  of  elementary  educa- 
tion, emergency  fire  and  medical  services,  environmental  pro- 
tection, and  the  maintenance  of  historical  landmarks. 

Municipal  governments,  headed  by  a  mayor  or  municipal 
president  (regente)  and  a  municipal  council  (ayuntamiento) ,  are 
popularly  elected  for  three-year  terms.  Article  115  of  the  1917 
constitution  proclaims  the  autonomy  of  local  governments 
according  to  the  principle  of  the  free  municipality  (municipio 
libre).  Although  they  are  authorized  to  collect  property  taxes 
and  user  fees,  municipalities  have  historically  lacked  the  means 
to  do  so,  relying  mainly  on  transfers  from  higher  levels  of  gov- 
ernment for  approximately  80  percent  of  their  revenues. 
Responding  to  concerns  that  excessive  centralization  of  politi- 
cal power  and  financial  resources  would  jeopardize  long-term 
popular  support  for  the  PRI,  President  de  la  Madrid  advocated 
reforming  intergovernmental  relations  to  allow  greater  munici- 
pal autonomy.  De  la  Madrid's  municipal  reform  culminated  in 
the  1984  amendments  to  Article  115,  which  expanded  munici- 
palities' authority  to  raise  revenue  and  formulate  budgets.  The 
Salinas  administration's  National  Solidarity  Program  (Pro- 
grama  Nacional  de  Solidaridad — Pronasol)  provided  another 
source  of  revenue  for  municipal  governments  (see  Social 
Spending,  ch.  2).  By  bypassing  state  bureaucracies  and  chan- 
neling federal  funds  directly  to  municipalities  and  community 
organizations,  Pronasol  undermined  state  governments'  con- 
trol over  municipal  finances,  albeit  by  promoting  municipali- 
ties' dependence  on  the  federal  government. 

The  Party  System 

Institutional  Revolutionary  Party 

The  PRI,  Mexico's  "official"  party,  was  the  country's  preemi- 
nent political  organization  from  1929  until  the  early  1990s.  In 
terms  of  power,  it  was  second  only  to  the  president,  who  also 
serves  as  the  party's  effective  chief.  Until  the  early  1980s,  the 
PRI's  position  in  the  Mexican  political  system  was  hegemonic, 
with  opposition  parties  posing  little  or  no  threat  to  its  power 
base  or  its  near  monopoly  of  public  office.  This  situation 


247 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

changed  during  the  mid-1980s,  as  opposition  parties  of  the  left 
and  right  began  to  seriously  challenge  PRI  candidates  for  local, 
state,  and  national-level  offices. 

The  PRI  was  founded  by  Calles  in  1929  as  the  National  Revo- 
lutionary Party  (Partido  Nacional  Revolucionario — PNR),  a 
loose  confederation  of  local  political  bosses  and  military 
strongmen  grouped  together  with  labor  unions,  peasant  orga- 
nizations, and  regional  political  parties.  In  its  early  years,  it 
served  primarily  as  a  means  of  organizing  and  containing  the 
political  competition  among  the  leaders  of  the  various  revolu- 
tionary factions.  Calles,  operating  through  the  party  organiza- 
tion, was  able  to  undermine  much  of  the  strength  of  peasant 
and  labor  organizations  that  affiliated  with  the  party  and  to 
weaken  the  regional  military  commanders  who  had  operated 
with  great  autonomy  throughout  the  1920s.  By  1934  Calles  was 
in  control  of  Mexican  politics  and  government,  even  after  he 
left  the  presidency,  largely  through  his  manipulation  of  the 
PNR. 

Between  1934  and  1940,  an  intense  struggle  for  political 
control  developed  between  Calles  and  the  new  president, 
Cardenas.  At  the  time,  Calles  represented  the  conservative  ele- 
ments of  the  revolutionary  coalition,  while  Cardenas  drew  his 
support  from  the  more  radical  political  elements.  To 
strengthen  his  hand  against  Calles,  Cardenas  reunited  the 
labor  and  peasant  organizations  that  Calles  had  earlier  frag- 
mented and  formed  two  national  federations,  the  National 
Peasant  Confederation  (Confederation  Nacional  Campesina — 
CNC)  and  the  Confederation  of  Mexican  Workers  (Confedera- 
cion de  Trabajadores  Mexicanos — CTM).  Using  these  organi- 
zations as  the  bases  of  his  support,  Cardenas  then  reorganized 
the  PNR  in  1938,  renaming  it  the  Party  of  the  Mexican  Revolu- 
tion (Partido  de  la  Revolution  Mexicana — PRM),  incorporat- 
ing the  CTM  and  the  CNC  and  giving  the  PRM  an  organization 
by  sectors:  labor,  agrarian,  popular,  and  military.  The  creation 
of  these  groups  and  their  integration  into  the  party  marked  the 
legitimation  of  the  existing  interest  group  organizations  and 
the  transformation  of  the  political  system  from  an  elite  to  a 
mass-based  system.  Within  a  year,  the  PRM  claimed  some  4.3 
million  members:  2.5  million  peasants,  1.3  million  workers, 
and  500,000  in  the  popular  sector.  In  1946  President  Manuel 
Avila  Camacho  abolished  the  military  sector,  shifted  its  mem- 
bers into  the  popular  sector,  and  renamed  the  party  the  PRI. 


248 


Government  and  Politics 


Beginning  with  the  Cardenas  administration  in  the  late 
1930s,  the  PRI  and  its  predecessors  engineered  an  unprece- 
dented political  peace.  The  overt  political  intervention  by  the 
military  that  had  characterized  the  country's  politics  through- 
out the  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries  largely  disap- 
peared when  Avila  Camacho,  the  last  president  who  came  from 
a  military  background,  left  office  in  1946.  For  nearly  five 
decades,  there  were  few  episodes  of  large-scale  organized  vio- 
lence and  no  revolutionary  movements  that  enjoyed  wide- 
spread support,  despite  considerable  economic  strains  between 
1968  and  1975  and  a  difficult  period  of  economic  austerity 
beginning  in  1982. 

For  the  middle  class,  whose  members  typically  had  led  rebel- 
lions in  the  past,  the  PRI  provided  upward  mobility  either 
through  politics  (the  rule  of  no  reelection  opened  frequent 
opportunities  for  public  office)  or  through  business  during  the 
high-growth  period  of  "stabilizing  development"  that  lasted 
from  the  early  1950s  until  the  late  1960s.  The  PRI  also  inte- 
grated workers  and  peasants  into  the  political  system  by  claim- 
ing to  be  the  only  vehicle  able  to  realize  their  demands  for 
labor  union  rights  and  land  reform.  The  party  operated  much 
like  an  urban  political  machine  in  the  United  States.  It  weak- 
ened attempts  to  form  horizontal  class-  or  interest-based  politi- 
cal alliances  within  the  lower  class  by  dispensing  services  to 
individuals  in  exchange  for  their  votes.  The  PRI  emphasized 
personal  relationships  between  individuals  of  the  lower  class 
and  party  and  government  officials.  It  distributed  political 
patronage  from  the  top  down  to  members  of  organized  labor, 
the  agrarian  movement,  and  the  popular  sector  in  accordance 
with  each  group's  relative  strength  in  a  given  area.  Finally,  it 
used  electoral  fraud,  corruption,  bribery,  and  repression  when 
necessary  to  maintain  control  over  individuals  and  groups. 

The  PRI  has  been  widely  described  as  a  coalition  of  networks 
of  aspiring  politicians  seeking  not  only  positions  of  power  and 
prestige  but  also  the  concomitant  opportunity  for  personal 
enrichment.  At  the  highest  levels  of  the  political  system,  the 
major  vehicles  for  corruption  have  been  illegal  landholdings 
and  the  manipulation  of  public-sector  enterprises.  In  the  lower 
reaches  of  the  party  and  governmental  hierarchies,  the  pre- 
ferred methods  of  corruption  have  been  bribery,  charging  the 
public  for  legally  free  public  services,  charging  members  of 
unions  for  positions,  nepotism,  and  outright  theft  of  public 
money.  This  corruption,  although  condemned  by  Mexican  and 


249 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

foreign  observers  alike,  historically  served  an  important  func- 
tion in  the  political  system  by  providing  a  means  of  upward 
mobility  within  the  system  and  ensuring  that  those  who  were 
forced  to  retire  from  politics  by  the  principle  of  no  reelection 
would  have  little  incentive  to  seek  alternatives  outside  the  PRI 
structure. 

Official  corruption  reached  unprecedented  levels  during 
the  1970s  when  petroleum  revenues  surged  as  a  result  of 
higher  oil  prices  and  when  newly  discovered  oil  fields  in  Chia- 
pas and  the  Bahfa  de  Campeche  began  producing.  Much  of  the 
wealth  that  flowed  into  the  country  through  the  state  oil 
monopoly,  Mexican  Petroleum  (Petroleos  Mexicanos — 
Pemex),  was  squandered  in  wasteful  and  unnecessary  projects 
and  the  inflation  of  payrolls.  The  main  beneficiaries  of  high- 
level  graft  during  this  period  were  the  senior  executives  of  the 
national  oil  workers  union  and  high-level  PRI  functionaries. 
This  brand  of  official  corruption  reached  new  heights  during 
the  presidency  of  Lopez  Portillo  (1976-82),  who  allegedly 
acquired  a  US$2  million  house  as  a  "gift"  from  the  oil  workers' 
union  and  was  subsequently  vilified  by  the  media  and  the  pub- 
lic as  a  symbol  of  PRI  graft. 

Public  disclosure  of  the  excesses  of  the  Lopez  Portillo  years, 
which  came  to  light  during  the  severe  financial  crisis  of  the 
early  1980s,  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  PRI's  internal  poli- 
tics as  well  as  on  its  overall  level  of  public  support.  Internally, 
the  severe  public  backlash  against  the  PRI  discredited  many 
career  politicians  within  the  party  who  had  personally  bene- 
fited from  the  fiscal  profligacy  of  the  Lopez  Portillo  sexenio,  and 
created  opportunities  for  an  emerging  generation  of  tecnicos 
(technocrats)  to  assume  high-level  government  posts.  Many  of 
these  tecnicos  were  brought  into  the  cabinet  by  President  de  la 
Madrid  to  help  restore  the  integrity  of  the  public  accounts  dur- 
ing the  early  1980s  financial  crisis. 

During  the  de  la  Madrid  sexenio  (1982-88),  the  PRI  began  to 
downplay  its  traditional  populist  and  nationalist  agenda  and 
adopted  a  probusiness,  free-market  platform.  These  changes 
produced  an  intraparty  split  between  the  populist  wing  domi- 
nated by  politicos  (career  politicians)  and  the  politically  inexpe- 
rienced tecnicos.  The  nomination  of  Salinas,  a  Harvard- 
educated  political  economist,  as  the  PRI  candidate  for  the  1988 
presidential  election  triggered  the  final  rupture  between  these 
two  groups.  Salinas's  nomination  prompted  two  important 
party  leaders,  Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas  (the  son  of  President 


250 


Government  and  Politics 


Cardenas  and  himself  a  former  governor  of  Michoacan)  and 
Porfirio  Munoz  Ledo  (a  former  PRI  secretary  general),  to 
resign  from  the  PRI  and  create  a  broad  coalition  of  leftist  par- 
ties, labor  unions,  and  grassroots  organizations  united  in  sup- 
port of  a  presidential  bid  by  Cardenas  (see  Party  of  the 
Democratic  Revolution,  this  ch.).  This  leftist  faction  criticized 
the  "neoliberal"  policies  of  the  de  la  Madrid  government  and 
called  for  a  return  to  the  party's  traditional  populist  platform. 

Although  the  PRI  party  bosses  remained  loyal  to  Salinas, 
allowing  the  party  to  win  the  July  1988  presidential  election, 
the  1988  vote  was  a  major  psychological  blow  to  the  ruling 
party.  With  the  1988  vote,  the  PRI  saw  its  fifty-year  dominance 
over  the  political  system  come  to  an  almost  disastrous  end.  The 
PRI  received  its  lowest  margin  of  victory  ever,  a  dubious  50.7 
percent  of  all  votes  cast,  down  from  71.6  percent  in  1982  and 
98.7  percent  in  1976.  For  the  first  time  since  the  consolidation 
of  single-party  rule  in  the  1940s,  opposition  leaders  were 
elected  to  the  Senate,  and  the  PRI  lost  more  than  one-third  of 
the  seats  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  to  the  two  main  opposi- 
tion forces,  the  National  Action  Party  (Partido  de  Accion 
Nacional — PAN)  and  the  Cardenas-led  coalition.  The  results  of 
the  1988  elections  were  widely  viewed  as  marking  the  end  of 
single-party  hegemony  by  the  PRI  and  were  even  interpreted  by 
some  observers  as  a  prelude  to  the  fragmentation  and  collapse 
of  the  ruling  coalition. 

Responding  to  public  pressure  for  political  renewal  and 
seeking  to  avoid  further  rupture  in  the  party  ranks,  President 
Salinas  attempted  to  improve  the  PRI's  public  image  without 
fundamentally  challenging  its  authoritarian  and  clientelist 
practices.  Salinas  took  steps  to  clean  up  the  electoral  process 
and  moved  forcefully  against  those  elements  of  the  party  and 
organized  labor  most  closely  associated  with  corruption.  How- 
ever, Salinas's  anticorruption  efforts  were  by  no  means  system- 
atic. In  many  instances,  corrupt  officials  were  dismissed 
because  of  their  defiance  of  the  new  president  rather  than  for 
their  venality.  Although  he  continued  de  la  Madrid's  practice  of 
tapping  highly  trained  technocrats  to  fill  cabinet  posts,  Salinas 
took  care  not  to  completely  disavow  the  party's  politico  wing  in 
filling  high-level  posts.  In  addition,  the  new  president  shrewdly 
manipulated  state  resources  through  popular  programs,  such 
as  Pronasol,  in  order  to  recover  the  support  of  low-income 
Mexicans  who  had  backed  Cardenas  in  1988. 


251 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

President  Salinas's  political  maneuvers  and  a  modest  eco- 
nomic recovery  resulted  in  a  better  showing  for  the  PRI  in  the 
midterm  elections  of  August  1991.  In  the  races  for  300  elec- 
toral districts  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  thirty-two  Senate 
seats,  and  six  governorships,  the  PRI  won  61.4  percent  of  the 
votes  cast.  This  was  a  sizable  increase  from  the  50  percent 
received  in  the  1988  national  election.  Overall,  the  PRI  won 
290  seats  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  all  but  one  seat  in  the 
Senate,  and  five  of  the  six  contested  governorships. 

During  his  administration,  Salinas  downplayed  the  corporat- 
ist  relationships  between  the  state  and  society  instituted  by 
Cardenas  while  reaching  out  to  more  traditional  interest 
groups.  In  his  efforts  to  broaden  and  democratize  the  PRI,  Sali- 
nas distanced  the  party  from  the  PRI-affiliated  labor  unions 
and  ejido  associations,  while  seeking  a  reconciliation  between 
the  PRI  and  its  historical  adversaries,  such  as  foreign  investors, 
agribusiness,  private  banks,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  and 
export  industries.  In  foreign  affairs,  the  PRI  shed  much  of  its 
economic  nationalism  under  Salinas,  while  retaining  its  inde- 
pendence from  the  United  States  on  regional  security  matters. 
However,  even  President  Salinas  was  unwilling  to  seek  a  consti- 
tutional amendment  to  end  public  ownership  of  petroleum 
and  natural  gas  deposits,  a  mainstay  of  PRI  nationalism  for 
more  than  sixty  years. 

The  executive  organization  of  the  PRI  is  pyramidal,  with  the 
president  of  the  Republic  at  the  top.  The  party  is  headed  by  a 
president  and  a  secretary  general,  who  together  direct  a 
National  Executive  Committee  of  the  party's  top  leaders.  At  the 
party  base,  there  is  a  National  Assembly,  which  meets  every  six 
years  to  discuss  and  review  the  party's  platform  as  well  as  to  for- 
mally nominate  the  party's  candidate  for  the  presidency.  The 
National  Assembly  also  elects  the  members  of  the  National 
Executive  Council.  Although  the  party's  presidential  candidate 
is  formally  nominated  at  the  National  Assembly  Congress,  in 
practice  the  assembly  has  served  only  to  ratify  the  candidate 
handpicked  by  the  president  through  the  dedazo.  In  accor- 
dance with  political  reforms  approved  in  the  early  1990s,  the 
PRI's  National  Assembly  is  expected  to  assume  a  much  more 
significant  role  in  nominating  the  party's  presidential  candi- 
date for  the  election  to  be  held  in  the  year  2000. 

National  Action  Party 

Founded  in  1939  by  Manuel  Gomez  Moran,  the  National 


252 


Government  and  Politics 


Action  Party  (Partido  de  Accion  Nacional — PAN)  was  the  first 
genuine  opposition  party  to  develop  in  Mexico.  The  PAN 
emerged  as  a  conservative  reaction  against  the  nationalizations 
and  land  confiscations  undertaken  by  the  Cardenas  govern- 
ment during  the  1930s.  The  PAN  resembled  a  standard  Chris- 
tian Democratic  party,  and  its  early  support  derived  primarily 
from  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  the  business  sector,  and 
other  groups  alienated  by  the  left-wing  populist  reforms  of  the 
Cardenas  government.  Although  the  PAN  is  much  more  con- 
servative than  the  PRI  on  social  issues,  since  the  mid-1980s  the 
PAN's  economic  program  has  been  almost  indistinguishable 
from  that  of  the  PRI  governments  it  has  attempted  to  supplant. 

The  PAN  has  traditionally  favored  a  limited  role  of  the  gov- 
ernment in  the  economy,  an  orientation  that  has  been  adopted 
by  the  PRI  during  the  past  fifteen  years  under  presidents  de  la 
Madrid,  Salinas,  and  Zedillo.  Historically,  the  PAN  also  has 
campaigned  in  favor  of  a  breakup  of  the  communal  ejidos  into 
individually  owned  plots  of  land.  In  1992  the  Salinas  adminis- 
tration introduced  radical  reforms  to  the  land  tenure  law  that 
allowed  ejidatarios  to  sell  their  plots  and  to  consolidate  their 
holdings  (see  Rural  Society,  ch.  2).  This  convergence  of  PRI 
and  PAN  economic  programs  encouraged  the  PAN  congres- 
sional delegation  to  work  closely  with  the  Salinas  administra- 
tion to  pass  the  government's  sweeping  economic  reforms.  In 
an  effort  to  distance  itself  from  the  PRI,  in  the  mid-1990s,  the 
PAN  has  stressed  issues  such  as  the  need  for  democratization, 
eradication  of  government  corruption,  and  additional  elec- 
toral reforms. 

Traditionally,  the  PAN  has  had  strong  support  in  the  coun- 
try's wealthiest  and  most  urbanized  regions  of  the  north  and 
center,  particularly  in  the  Federal  District,  Jalisco,  Nuevo  Leon, 
Puebla,  and  Sonora.  The  effects  of  PAN  victories  in  the  north- 
ern part  of  the  country  since  the  1980s  are  highly  significant, 
particularly  in  the  states  of  Baja  California  Norte,  Chihuahua, 
Durango,  Nuevo  Leon,  Sinaloa,  and  Sonora.  The  PAN  has  also 
displayed  political  strength  in  the  states  of  Guanajuato,  Jalisco, 
and  Yucatan.  The  PAN  won  the  governorships  and  congres- 
sional majorities  in  Baja  California  Norte  and  Chihuahua  dur- 
ing the  Salinas  administration,  and  the  local  congress  in  the 
state  of  Guanajuato  gave  a  third  governorship  to  the  PAN  after 
a  state  election  had  been  plagued  with  irregularities.  The 
PAN's  major  handicap  has  been  its  lack  of  appeal  to  urban 
labor  and  peasant  groups.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

The  PAN  has  presented  a  candidate  in  every  presidential 
race  since  1946  with  the  exception  of  1976,  when  its  leadership 
could  not  reach  consensus  on  a  candidate.  It  has  always  been 
the  main  opposition  to  the  PRI,  although  in  the  1988  presiden- 
tial election  its  presidential  candidate,  Manuel  Clouthier,  ran 
third  to  Salinas  and  Cardenas.  By  1992  the  PAN  controlled 
more  than  100  municipal  governments  in  addition  to  the  three 
governorships.  With  Diego  Fernandez  de  Cevallos  as  its  candi- 
date and  "por  un  Mexico  sin  mentiras"  ("for  a  Mexico  without 
lies")  as  its  campaign  slogan,  the  PAN  won  a  comfortable  sec- 
ond place  in  the  1994  presidential  race.  The  second-place  win 
consolidated  the  PAN's  role  as  the  main  opposition  political 
force  in  the  country. 

Democratic  Revolutionary  Party 

The  Democratic  Revolutionary  Party  (Partido  Revoluciona- 
rio  Democratico — PRD),  established  in  1989,  evolved  from  the 
National  Democratic  Front  (Frente  Democratico  Nacional — 
FDN),  under  the  leadership  of  Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas.  Carde- 
nas left  the  PRI  in  1988  in  protest  over  its  choice  of  Salinas,  a 
free-market  reformer,  as  the  PRI's  presidential  nominee.  The 
PRD's  party  program  emphasizes  social  welfare  concerns  and 
opposes  most  of  the  economic  reforms  implemented  since  the 
mid-1980s. 

The  PRD's  agenda  dates  back  to  the  populist  and  nationalist 
measures  implemented  by  President  Lazaro  Cardenas  during 
the  1930s.  The  party  promotes  economic  nationalism,  as 
opposed  to  the  structural  neoliberal  changes  that  focus  on 
increasing  trade  and  foreign  investment  to  boost  the  Mexican 
economy  introduced  by  the  PRI  during  President  de  la 
Madrid's  administration.  Although  the  PRD  holds  a  good  part 
of  the  former  communist  and  socialist  parties'  rank  and  file, 
the  PRD  is  controlled  by  former  PRI  leaders.  An  estimated  70 
percent  of  its  leadership  consists  of  former  PRI  members,  while 
30  percent  consists  of  former  members  of  the  Mexican  commu- 
nist and  socialist  parties.  The  PRD  president,  Porfirio  Murioz 
Ledo,  served  as  president  of  the  PRI  during  the  sexenio  of  Luis 
Echeverria  Alvarez.  The  PRD  opposed  most  of  the  constitu- 
tional amendments  passed  during  the  Salinas  government,  the 
most  important  being  the  ecclesiastical,  agrarian,  and  electoral 
system  reforms.  Although  the  PRD  is  currently  recognized  as 
an  opposition  voice  in  the  national  debate,  it  remains  in  a  dis- 
tant third  place  in  the  electoral  scenario.  Toward  the  end  of 


254 


Government  and  Politics 


the  1994  presidential  race,  the  left  strongly  criticized  Cuauhte- 
moc Cardenas  for  having  lent  qualified  support  to  the  broad 
principles  of  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement 
(NAFTA)  and  the  privatization  of  some  state-owned  compa- 
nies. Despite  these  changes,  Cardenas  and  the  PRD  are  com- 
mitted to  greater  state  control  of  the  economy  and  propose  the 
renegotiation  of  parts  of  NAFTA  with  the  United  States  and 
Canada. 

Minor  Opposition  Parties 

In  1954  dissident  members  of  the  PRI  established  the 
Authentic  Party  of  the  Mexican  Revolution  (Partido  Autentico 
de  la  Revolucion  Mexicana — PARM).  Its  political  platform, 
which  is  based  on  the  principles  of  the  Mexican  Revolution 
and  the  constitution  of  1917,  is  strongly  nationalistic.  The 
PARM  has  a  limited  role  in  national  politics,  although  it  was 
able  to  maintain  its  electoral  registration  status  as  well  as  its 
minority  representation  in  the  lower  chamber  until  the  1994 
elections,  when  it  received  less  than  0.5  percent  of  the  vote. 
The  PARM  temporarily  joined  the  FDN  during  the  1988  elec- 
tions but  broke  with  the  party  coalition  in  1989. 

The  Popular  Socialist  Party  (Partido  Popular  Socialista — 
PPS)  was  first  organized  in  1948  by  a  radical  sector  of  the  PRI 
led  by  Vicente  Lombardo  Toledano,  the  founder  of  the  PRI's 
labor  organization.  Despite  the  PPS's  Marxist  orientation,  its 
membership  has  traditionally  supported  the  official  party's  can- 
didate in  presidential  elections,  while  working  closely  with  the 
PRI  in  most  initiatives  dealing  with  the  expansion  of  the  gov- 
ernment's role  in  the  economy.  In  1988,  however,  the  PPS 
broke  with  tradition  and  joined  the  FDN  in  support  of  Carde- 
nas's  presidential  bid.  The  PPS  fielded  its  own  candidate,  Mar- 
cela  Lombardo  Otero,  in  the  1994  presidential  election.  Otero 
received  0.46  percent  of  the  total  vote. 

The  Cardenas  Front  of  the  National  Reconstruction  Party 
(Partido  del  Frente  Cardenista  de  Reconstruction  Nacional — 
PFCRN),  formerly  the  Socialist  Workers'  Party,  was  established 
in  1973  with  labor  support.  It  traditionally  had  worked  closely 
with  the  PRI,  but  joined  the  FDN  in  supporting  the  candidacy 
of  Cardenas  in  1988.  The  PFCRN  ran  its  own  candidate,  Rafael 
Aguilar  Talamantes,  in  the  1994  presidential  race,  receiving 
0.77  percent  of  the  vote. 

Other  small  political  parties  that  registered  for  the  1994 
presidential  election  included  the  Mexican  Green  Ecologist 


255 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Party  (Partido  Verde  Ecologista  Mexican o — PVEM),  the  Labor 
Party  (Partido  del  Trabajo — PT),  and  the  National  Opposition 
Union  (Union  Nacional  Opositora — UNO).  Support  for  the 
PT  and  the  PVEM  is  found  predominantly  in  urban  areas.  The 
PT  operates  mainly  in  the  Federal  District,  where  it  made  a  sur- 
prisingly strong  showing  in  1994. 

Of  the  six  small  political  parties  that  participated  in  the  1994 
elections  (PARM,  PFCRN,  PPS,  PT,  PVEM,  and  UNO),  only  the 
PT  and  its  candidate,  Cecilia  Soto  Gonzalez,  received  more 
than  3  percent  of  the  vote.  Under  current  electoral  law,  the  PT 
is  the  only  minor  party  that  may  legally  contest  the  next  presi- 
dential election  in  2000. 

Institutions  of  Civil  Society 

Organized  Labor 

Labor  unions  are  mostly  representative  of  workers  in  urban 
areas.  Most  labor  unions  are  affiliated  with  the  PRI  through  the 
Confederation  of  Mexican  Workers  (Confederation  de  Traba- 
jadores  Mexicanos — CTM),  which  is  associated  with  some  inde- 
pendent unions  and  federations  in  an  umbrella  organization 
known  as  the  Congress  of  Labor  (Congreso  del  Trabajo — CT). 
During  August  1991,  the  CT  confirmed  its  direct  relationship 
with  the  government  party  in  a  document  called  the  Political 
Agreement  Between  the  PRI  and  the  Organization  of  the  CT. 

The  CT,  considered  the  labor  sector  of  the  PRI,  consists  of 
more  than  thirty  organizations  encompassing  85  percent  of  the 
unionized  workforce.  In  the  early  1990s,  Mexico  had  an  esti- 
mated 9.5  million  unionized  workers.  The  CT  mediates 
between  the  labor  unions  and  the  government.  At  the  same 
time,  it  provides  the  state  with  a  formal  mechanism  for  political 
manipulation  of  the  labor  force. 

The  CTM  is  the  largest  and  most  influential  organization  in 
the  CT,  comprising  over  11,000  labor  unions  with  more  than  5 
million  union  members.  It  is  considered  the  spearhead  of  the 
Mexican  labor  movement.  Since  1941  the  CTM  has  been 
tightly  controlled  by  its  secretary  general,  Fidel  Velazquez,  con- 
sidered one  of  the  most  influential  political  figures  in  Mexico. 

The  second  organization  within  the  CT  is  the  Federation  of 
Unions  of  Workers  in  the  Service  of  the  State  (Federation  de 
Sindicatos  de  Trabajadores  al  Servicio  del  Estado — FSTSE). 
The  FSTSE  was  established  in  1938  as  an  umbrella  organization 
for  labor  unions  within  the  federal  civil  system  and  other  gov- 


256 


Government  and  Politics 


ernment-related  organizations.  In  1990  the  FSTSE  consisted  of 
eighty-nine  unions  with  a  total  membership  of  1.8  million 
employees. 

The  Revolutionary  Confederation  of  Workers  and  Peasants 
(Confederacion  Revolucionaria  de  Obreros  y  Campesinos — 
CROC)  is  the  third  largest  labor  organization  within  the  CT. 
The  CROC  was  established  in  1952;  since  1980,  it  has  been 
under  the  leadership  of  Alberto  Juarez  Blancas.  During  the 
1990s,  the  CROC  had  an  estimated  membership  of  some 
600,000.  Other  important  labor  organizations  are  the  Regional 
Confederation  of  Mexican  Workers  (Confederacion  Regional 
de  Obreros  Mexicanos — CROM),  the  National  Federation  of 
Independent  Unions  (Federation  Nacional  de  Sindicatos  Inde- 
pendientes — FNSI),  the  Confederation  of  Workers  and  Peas- 
ants (Confederacion  de  Trabajadores  y  Campesinos — CTC), 
the  International  Proletarian  Movement  (Movimiento  Prole- 
tario  Internacional — MPI),  the  Confederation  of  Revolution- 
ary Workers  (Confederacion  de  Obreros  Revolucionarios — 
COR),  the  General  Confederation  of  Workers  (Confederacion 
General  de  Trabajadores — CGT),  the  Authentic  Labor  Front 
(Frente  Autentico  del  Trabajo — FAT),  and  the  Revolutionary 
Confederation  of  Workers  (Confederacion  Revolucionaria  de 
Trabajadores — CRT).  There  are,  in  addition,  some  1.5  million 
members  of  independent  unions  and  company  labor  organiza- 
tions. 

In  theory,  labor-management  relations  are  well  defined  by 
the  Labor  Code,  which  leaves  little  margin  for  bargaining  in 
labor  disputes.  All  labor  unions  receive  official  recognition  by 
applying  to  the  Secretariat  of  Labor  and  Social  Welfare.  Once  it 
is  officially  recognized,  a  union  is  protected  by  the  Labor  Code, 
which  details  the  rights  of  each  official  organization  to  receive 
social  security  payments,  to  participate  in  profit  sharing,  and  to 
use  meeting  halls,  among  many  other  benefits.  The  code  stipu- 
lates that  strikes  are  illegal  if  unauthorized  by  the  secretariat 
and  that  workers  participating  in  an  illegal  strike  will  be  subject 
to  government  sanctions  and  dismissal  by  their  employers. 

Corruption,  paternalism,  and  abuse  of  union  funds  have  tra- 
ditionally been  rampant  in  the  labor  movement.  In  recent 
years,  however,  the  traditional  oligarchic  leadership  of  most 
Mexican  labor  unions  has  been  challenged  by  the  rank  and 
file,  as  well  as  by  independent  unions  wishing  to  end  the  use  of 
leadership  positions  to  amass  wealth  and  power.  The  lack  of 
support  for  Salinas's  presidential  bid  by  the  leadership  of  some 


257 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

powerful  unions,  in  particular  that  of  the  union  of  oil  workers, 
contributed  to  a  change  in  government  relations  with  union 
groups.  President  Salinas  launched  an  anticorruption  cam- 
paign during  his  first  year  in  government,  toppling  from  power 
strong  labor  leaders  in  corruption-related  scandals.  Although 
the  level  of  corruption  and  abuse  of  power  has  not  been  sub- 
stantially reduced,  the  political  relationship  and  corporatist 
structure  between  the  labor  sector  and  the  party  are  currently 
undergoing  profound  changes.  There  is  a  sharp  distinction 
between  two  clashing  forces  in  the  labor  movement:  the  tradi- 
tional leadership  that  forcefully  resists  political  change  and  a 
new  generation  that  strongly  supports  the  government's 
neoliberal  policies  currently  in  place.  In  the  mid-1990s,  labor 
groups  have  less  impact  on  Mexican  politics  than  they  did  in 
the  past. 

Business  Organizations 

Traditionally,  business  interests  in  Mexico  are  driven  by  gov- 
ernment policies  and  interests.  In  addition  to  participation  of 
individual  businessmen  in  politics,  many  business  groups  are 
represented  in  government  agencies  and  commissions.  There 
has  always  been  a  close  connection  between  the  business  com- 
munity and  the  different  economic  cabinets.  The  most  influen- 
tial of  all  business  associations  is  the  Confederation  of  National 
Chambers  of  Commerce  (Confederacion  de  Camaras  Naciona- 
les  de  Comercio — Concanaco).  The  Confederation  of  Cham- 
bers of  Industry  (Confederacion  de  Camaras  de  Industria — 
Concamin)  serves  as  the  umbrella  organization  for  industrial 
associations.  There  is  also  the  National  Chamber  of  Manufac- 
turing Industries  (Camara  Nacional  de  la  Industria  de  la  Trans- 
fer macion — Canacintra),  which  historically  has  represented 
small  and  medium-sized  businesses.  A  sharp  distinction  exists 
between  small  and  big  business  in  Mexican  politics.  Although 
technically  these  organizations  are  not  integrated  into  a  partic- 
ular political  party,  contributions  of  big  business  go  first  to  the 
PRI  to  reward  government  policies  that  benefit  big  business 
and  to  make  sure  that  such  policies  continue.  According  to  PRI 
Finance  Secretary  Oscar  Espinoza  Villareal,  the  Mexican  pri- 
vate sector  contributed  between  54  and  67  billion  new  pesos 
(for  value  of  the  new  peso — see  Glossary)  to  the  campaigns  of 
government  party  candidates  for  the  August  1994  elections. 

Business  associations  such  as  Concanaco  play  an  active  role 
in  government  policy  debates.  Most  of  the  business  sector  cur- 


258 


Government  and  Politics 


rently  supports  the  reduction  of  trade  barriers,  liberal  eco- 
nomic policies,  and  conservative  labor  legislation.  The  success 
of  the  liberal  policies  launched  during  the  Salinas  sexenio 
greatly  benefited  the  Mexican  private  sector.  Thus,  relations 
between  the  business  community  and  the  PRI  improved  signifi- 
cantly. A  clear  example  of  the  improved  relationship  was  a 
well-publicized  gathering  held  in  February  1993,  when  thirty  of 
Mexico's  multimillionaires  pledged  an  average  US$25  million 
each  in  support  of  the  1994  PRI  election  campaign.  At  the 
fund-raising  dinner,  television  baron  Emilio  Azcarrago,  consid- 
ered the  richest  man  in  Latin  America,  pledged  US$70  million 
to  the  government's  party  "in  gratitude"  for  his  prosperity  dur- 
ing the  Salinas  administration.  The  great  disparity  in  funding 
between  the  PRI  and  the  opposition  during  the  1994  electoral 
race  was  clearly  attributable  to  generous  contributions  from 
domestic  private  enterprises  to  the  PRI. 

The  Church 

Although  there  has  been  conflict  between  church  and  state 
in  Mexico  since  the  country's  independence,  more  than  90 
percent  of  the  population  remains  Roman  Catholic,  according 
to  1990  census  estimates.  The  state  feud  with  the  Roman  Cath- 
olic Church  is  reflected  in  the  1917  constitution,  which 
imposes  many  restrictions  on  the  influence  and  privileges  of 
the  clergy  in  Mexico.  The  early  drafts  of  the  1917  constitution 
banned  public  religious  ceremonies,  the  establishment  of 
monastic  orders,  and  property  ownership  by  the  Roman  Catho- 
lic Church,  and  forbade  the  clergy  from  participating  in  elec- 
tions. All  church  buildings,  according  to  law,  were  considered 
national  property,  and  church  ministers  had  to  be  Mexican 
nationals.  The  law  also  prohibited  criticism  of  public  law  and 
institutions,  both  public  and  private,  by  members  of  the  clergy. 

Far  from  bring  a  traditional  conservative  force,  however,  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church  has  been  a  strong  advocate  for  social 
and  political  change.  In  the  late  1980s,  for  example,  the  clergy 
were  active  in  the  northern  states,  condemning  electoral  fraud 
to  the  extent  of  threatening  to  cease  celebrating  masses  unless 
there  were  a  recount  of  the  vote.  The  Roman  Catholic  Church 
was  also  instrumental  throughout  the  1980s  in  demanding  rec- 
ognition of  its  legal  status  and  electoral  participation  for  the 
clergy.  Despite  the  traditional  view  of  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church  as  representative  or  supporter  of  the  elites,  the  Mexi- 
can Roman  Catholic  Church  has  emerged  during  the  last 


259 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

decades  as  the  defender  of  social  justice,  and  the  more  progres- 
sive clergy  have  worked  closely  with  underprivileged  sectors  to 
increase  economic  and  social  reform. 

The  Salinas  administration  changed  dramatically  the  rela- 
tions between  church  and  state  in  Mexico  (see  Church-State 
Relations,  ch.  2).  During  the  fall  of  1991,  Salinas's  government 
took  the  first  steps  toward  lifting  some  restrictions  on  church 
activities  and  introduced  a  reform  proposal  to  end  constitu- 
tional limits  on  the  church.  The  new  law,  approved  by  the  Con- 
gress in  December  1991  and  promulgated  in  January  1992, 
amended  the  constitution  of  1917.  Under  the  new  law,  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church  is  formally  recognized  by  the  state, 
the  clergy  are  allowed  to  vote,  the  possession  of  property  by 
churches  is  legal,  and  religion  may  be  taught  in  private  schools. 
Mexico  also  established  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Vatican, 
relations  that  had  been  broken  in  1867.  State  and  church,  nev- 
ertheless, remain  separate,  and  church  buildings  remain  state 
property. 

Protestant  groups  in  Mexico  have  tended  to  support  the  PRI, 
in  light  of  the  party's  broad  appeal.  The  political  alternatives 
are  not  viable  options  for  Mexican  Protestants  because  the 
opposition  on  the  right,  the  PAN,  openly  represents  Roman 
Catholicism  and  groups  on  the  left  exclude  religion  from  their 
political  goals.  Toward  the  latter  part  of  the  twentieth  century, 
the  participation  of  Protestant  groups  in  Mexican  politics 
increased  as  Protestants  supported  efforts  aimed  at  political 
change. 

Given  the  country's  anticlerical  history,  it  is  highly  unlikely 
that  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  will  assume  a  direct  role  in 
Mexican  politics  in  the  near  future.  However,  the  church's  tra- 
ditional commitment  to  social  justice  and  economic  develop- 
ment, along  with  the  government  redefinition  of  its 
institutional  responsibilities,  provides  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church  with  a  strong  voice  on  future  political  issues. 

The  Media 

Based  on  the  number  of  newspapers,  publishers,  radio  sta- 
tions, and  television  networks  in  the  country,  Mexico  is  consid- 
ered the  media  power  center  of  Spanish-speaking  Latin 
America.  Mexico's  mainstream  newspapers  and  periodicals 
range  in  political  ideology  and  independence  from  the  official 
government  newspaper  El  National  to  the  left-wing  indepen- 
dent El  Proceso.  Although  the  press  was  for  many  years  generally 


260 


Government  and  Politics 


pro-establishment  and  supportive  of  the  PRI,  it  diversified  dur- 
ing the  1980s  to  reflect  a  wider  spectrum  of  opinion.  In  early 
1994,  the  government  postponed  its  stated  plans  to  sell  El 
Nacional  to  private  owners  but  declared  that  the  newspaper 
would  no  longer  receive  public  funding. 

The  constitution  of  1917  explicitly  guarantees  freedom  of 
the  press.  Article  7  forbids  prior  censorship,  and  an  amend- 
ment to  Article  6  adopted  in  1977  declares  that  "the  right  of 
information  will  be  guaranteed  by  the  state."  However,  these 
guarantees  are  highly  qualified  in  practice.  The  Press  Law  of 
1917,  for  instance,  restricts  the  press  on  matters  of  personal  pri- 
vacy, morality,  and  public  health.  Many  other  regulations  gov- 
ern the  news  media.  The  1960  Law  on  Radio  and  Television, 
for  instance,  forbids  the  broadcast  of  material  deemed  offen- 
sive to  national  heroes. 

Although  nominally  independent,  the  news  media  are  sub- 
ject to  a  variety  of  mainly  indirect  economic  and  political  pres- 
sures from  the  government.  The  Secretariat  of  Communi- 
cations and  Transport  supervises  the  news  media,  granting 
publishing  and  broadcast  licenses  and  ensuring  adherence  to 
the  media  laws.  Successive  PRI  governments  have  influenced 
the  news  media  by  paying  individual  journalists  for  favorable 
coverage,  by  restricting  access  to  newsprint  and  ink  (the  state 
monopolizes  the  production  of  both,  although  this  control  was 
somewhat  reduced  under  President  Salinas),  by  withholding 
information  from  critical  journalists,  and  especially  by  granting 
or  withholding  government  advertising,  an  important  source 
of  revenue  for  the  press.  Many  newspapers  accept  government 
payments  for  the  insertion  of  official  announcements  disguised 
as  editorials.  Occasionally,  the  government  provides  indirect 
financial  inducements  to  particular  journalists  (for  example, 
by  offering  them  part  of  the  payment  for  official  advertising 
run  by  their  newspapers).  Some  journalists  and  opposition 
political  parties  have  accused  the  government  of  trying  to  con- 
ceal the  extent  of  official  subsidies  to  journalists  by  redirecting 
payoffs  through  the  PRI's  Office  of  Information. 

Government  tolerance  of  press  freedoms  varies  according 
to  the  sensitivities  of  the  president  in  office.  Traditionally,  the 
media  avoid  direct  criticism  of  an  incumbent  president.  On 
sensitive  issues  affecting  the  government,  the  press  provides 
only  minimal  coverage.  Among  the  many  unwritten  rules  is 
one  that  says  that  journalists  are  expected  to  respect  the  image 
of  the  president  and  other  high-level  government  officials.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

In  essence,  government  policies  may  be  criticized,  but 
elected  individuals  must  not  be  ridiculed.  Since  the  early 
1980s,  the  trend  toward  a  more  open  political  debate  has 
brought  greater  tolerance  of  criticism  in  the  media.  Some 
argue  that  this  tolerance,  which  has  occurred  faster  than  the 
increasing  democratization  of  the  political  system,  has  defini- 
tively contributed  to  increasing  public  awareness  of  the  need 
for  changes  within  the  Mexican  political  system. 

Television  is  highly  biased  toward  the  official  party,  as  illus- 
trated by  the  open  support  the  Televisa  network  gives  to  the 
government.  Televisa  is  part  of  Mexican  Telesystem  (Telesis- 
tema  Mexicano),  considered  the  biggest  communications  con- 
glomerate in  the  developing  world,  as  well  as  one  of  the  world's 
major  transnational  media  empires.  Televisa's  political  and  eco- 
nomic influence  in  Mexico  is  extensive.  Aside  from  the  owner- 
ship of  television  and  radio  stations,  it  has  significant  interests 
in  newsprint  and  publishing,  record  production,  home  videos, 
cinemas,  advertising  and  marketing,  real  estate,  tourism, 
sports,  and  the  food  processing  and  transport  industries. 

Mexico  City  has  fifteen  newspapers;  its  dailies  account  for 
more  than  50  percent  of  the  national  circulation.  In  1994  there 
were  eight  newspapers  in  Mexico  City  with  a  daily  circulation  of 
more  than  100,000  issues:  Esto  (450,000),  LaPrensa  (300,000), 
Novedades  (240,000),  Ovaciones  (220,000),  El  Heraldo  de  Mexico 
(209,600),  Excelsior  (200,000),  El Financiero  (135,000),  and  El 
Universal  (122,000).  Excelsior  is  the  most  prestigious  national 
daily  and  one  of  the  most  prominent  newspapers  in  Latin 
America,  known  for  its  breadth  of  coverage,  analytical  style, 
and  relative  independence.  The  oldest  of  the  traditional  news- 
papers is  El  Universal,  closely  associated  with  the  government 
throughout  the  1970s,  but  currently  known  for  its  indepen- 
dence in  reporting.  El  Nacional  is  the  official  newspaper  of  the 
federal  government.  The  largest  newspaper  group  is  the  Orga- 
nization Editorial  Mexicana  (OEM),  which  owns  some  ninety 
newspapers  throughout  the  country.  The  second  largest  pub- 
lishing group  is  Novedades  Editores,  which  is  part  of  the  Tele- 
sistema  Mexicano  conglomerate.  Some  of  the  leading  daily 
newspapers,  such  as  Excelsior  and  La  Prensa,  are  run  as  coopera- 
tives. 

There  are  five  national  news  agencies:  Notimex,  Infomex, 
Noti-Accion,  Notipress,  and  Agencia  Mexicana  de  Infor- 
macion.  Infomex  is  the  largest,  with  almost  100  offices 
throughout  the  country  and  some  twenty  foreign  correspon-

dents.  All  leading  international  agencies  have  bureaus  in 
Mexico  City. 

National  broadcasting  stations  are  divided  into  commercial 
and  cultural  networks.  All  commercial  stations  are  financed  by 
advertising  (both  public  and  private)  but  must  provide  12  per- 
cent of  broadcasting  time  for  government  use.  All  cultural  sta- 
tions are  operated  by  government  agencies  or  by  educational 
institutions.  Media  analysts  expect  that  the  economic  policies 
pursued  by  the  Salinas  and  Zedillo  administrations  will  have  a 
major  impact  on  the  media  by  further  reducing  state  interven- 
tion and  promoting  the  concentration  of  private  ownership. 

The  Electoral  Process  and  Political  Dynamics 

The  Electoral  Process 

Article  41  of  the  constitution  of  1917  and  subsequent 
amendments  regulate  electoral  politics  in  Mexico.  Suffrage  is 
universal  for  all  citizens  eighteen  or  older,  and  voting  is  com- 
pulsory, although  this  provision  is  rarely  enforced.  The  Mexi- 
can constitution  enshrines  the  principle  of  direct  election  by 
popular  vote  of  the  president  and  most  other  elected  officials. 
Executive  officeholders  may  not  be  reelected,  and  legislators 
may  not  serve  consecutive  terms.  Ordinary  elections  are  held 
every  six  years  for  president  and  members  of  the  Senate,  and 
every  three  years  for  deputies.  Since  1986  midterm  elections 
have  renewed  one-half  of  the  Senate,  in  addition  to  the  entire 
Chamber  of  Deputies.  Gubernatorial  elections  are  evenly  dis- 
tributed throughout  a  sexenio,  so  that  ordinarily  no  more  than 
six  governorships  are  contested  in  any  given  year. 

Although  holding  multicandidate  elections  in  which  the 
electorate  makes  the  final  choice  is  one  of  the  basic  principles 
of  the  Mexican  Revolution,  the  electoral  process  in  Mexico  has 
historically  fallen  short  of  this  liberal  ideal.  During  the  sixty- 
year  period  of  single-party  hegemony  that  followed  the  consoli- 
dation of  the  revolutionary  regime,  regular  elections  became 
an  important  symbol  of  stability  and  of  the  regime's  self- 
ascribed  democratic  character.  Beyond  fulfilling  an  ambiguous 
plebiscitary  function,  however,  elections  were  not  intended  as  a 
means  of  selecting  new  leaders,  nor  were  they  usually  relevant 
to  the  public  policy  process.  Instead,  leadership  turnover  was 
centrally  controlled  by  the  president,  while  most  significant 
interaction  between  public  officials  and  the  citizenry  took 


263 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

place  within  the  context  of  day-to-day  corporatist  bargaining 
and  informal  clientelist  relationships. 

As  the  beneficiary  of  a  noncompetitive  electoral  process,  the 
official  party  has  historically  enjoyed  a  near  monopoly  of  all  lev- 
els of  public  office.  For  almost  six  decades,  the  principal  politi- 
cal battles  in  Mexico  were  fought  among  elite  factions  and 
interest  groups  within  the  PRI  party  structure,  with  little  or  no 
meaningful  participation  by  independent  organizations  or 
opposition  parties.  During  this  prolonged  period  of  one-party 
hegemony,  several  modest  electoral  reforms  were  implemented 
by  the  government  in  order  to  maintain  the  appearance  of 
electoral  democracy  and  undercut  the  appeal  of  latent  opposi- 
tion movements.  Electoral  reforms  enacted  during  the  1970s 
included  the  allotment  of  a  minimum  number  of  congressional 
seats  to  both  legitimate  and  "satellite"  opposition  parties.  Addi- 
tional steps  toward  greater  political  pluralism  were  taken  dur- 
ing the  early  1980s,  when  President  de  la  Madrid  embarked  on 
a  campaign  to  make  local-level  politics  more  competitive. 

By  the  mid-1980s,  the  electoral  arena  had  been  liberalized 
and  the  political  space  for  opposition  had  expanded  to  such  an 
extent  that  the  PRI  found  itself  increasingly  challenged  at  the 
ballot  box.  In  1985  the  landslide  victories  of  PRI  candidates  in 
gubernatorial  and  municipal  elections  in  the  northern  state  of 
Chihuahua  led  to  widespread  allegations  of  electoral  fraud  by 
the  opposition  PAN,  which  had  expected  major  wins  in  one  of 
its  traditional  strongholds.  In  an  unprecedented  series  of  pub- 
lic protests,  a  variety  of  civic  groups,  with  support  from  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church,  staged  massive  demonstrations 
denouncing  the  official  tallies. 

Responding  to  increasing  popular  pressure  for  democratiza- 
tion, the  de  la  Madrid  administration  in  1986  introduced  an 
electoral  reform  package  that  expanded  opportunities  for  an 
opposition  presence  in  the  congress.  The  1986  Electoral 
Reform  Law  enlarged  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  from  400  to 
500  seats  and  doubled  the  number  of  congressional  seats  filled 
by  proportional  representation  to  200.  Of  the  500  deputyships, 
one  each  is  allocated  to  300  electoral  districts,  elected  by  sim- 
ple plurality  in  single-member  districts  comparable  to  those  in 
the  United  States.  The  remaining  200  seats  are  assigned  by  pro- 
portional representation  based  on  a  party's  share  of  the 
national  vote  tally.  The  proportional  seats  give  opposition  par- 
ties an  opportunity  to  be  represented  in  the  congress  even  if 
they  lose  all  of  the  district  races.  The  PRI  assured,  however,  that 


264 


Government  and  Politics 


the  distribution  of  proportional  seats  would  not  become  a 
means  for  a  coalition  of  parties  without  a  plurality  of  the  over- 
all vote  to  take  control  of  the  lower  house.  A  clause  in  the  elec- 
toral law  provides  that  enough  proportional  seats  in  the 
Chamber  of  Deputies  be  assigned  to  the  party  winning  an  over- 
all plurality  in  the  election  to  give  that  party  a  majority  in  the 
Chamber  of  Deputies. 

Theoretically,  no  party  is  barred  from  holding  a  single-mem- 
ber district  seat,  although  in  practice  an  overwhelming  number 
of  such  seats  have  been  held  by  the  PRI.  The  increase  in  the 
number  of  proportional  seats  was  a  concession  to  the  opposi- 
tion, which  relies  heavily  on  proportional  seating  for  its  repre- 
sentation in  the  congress.  The  1986  reform  also  introduced 
proportional  representation  in  state  legislatures  as  well  as  gov- 
ernment funding  for  all  registered  political  parties. 

The  1988  Elections 

The  1988  elections  were  a  watershed  in  the  history  of  Mexi- 
can politics,  marking  a  radical  shift  in  the  country's  political 
dynamics  and  providing  the  first  test  of  the  1986  electoral 
reforms.  The  emergence  of  two  nationally  prominent  opposi- 
tion candidates  afforded  an  unprecedented  challenge  to  the 
PRI's  electoral  machine,  which  until  that  time  had  faced  mostly 
obscure  and  poorly  financed  adversaries. 

Assailed  by  a  partisan  rupture  over  the  nomination  of  Sali- 
nas, which  ultimately  led  to  the  defection  of  much  of  the  PRI's 
populist  wing  to  the  leftist  opposition,  the  PRI  party  apparatus 
was  under  intense  pressure  to  produce  a  victory  or  face  disinte- 
gration. Within  the  context  of  a  national  economic  crisis,  an 
intraparty  split,  and  a  hotly  contested  presidential  race,  many 
observers  expected  the  PRI  to  resort  to  fraud  to  secure  a  deci- 
sive win. 

Although  the  PRI  maintained  control  of  the  presidency  and 
preserved  its  congressional  majority  in  the  July  1988  balloting, 
the  elections  were  a  blow  to  the  PRI's  preeminent  position  in 
Mexican  politics.  The  PRI  suffered  a  dramatic  erosion  of  18 
percent  in  its  share  of  the  presidential  vote  from  the  previous 
election  and  surrendered  an  unprecedented  48  percent  of 
seats  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  to  the  opposition.  The  offi- 
cial tally,  which  showed  Salinas  winning  a  bare  majority  of  50.7 
percent  of  the  vote,  was  questioned  by  an  unexpected  week- 
long  delay  in  the  computerized  tally  and  widespread  reports  of 
vote  fraud  and  irregularities.  As  a  result,  the  new  administra- 


265 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

tion  began  its  term  in  office  as  one  of  the  most  unpopular  in 
recent  Mexican  history. 

The  Salinas  Presidency:  Reform  and  Retrenchment 

Upon  assuming  office  in  December  1988,  Salinas  faced 
grave  challenges  to  his  authority  as  president.  Among  his  most 
pressing  concerns  was  the  need  to  defuse  political  tensions  that 
had  arisen  in  the  highly  polarized  climate  of  the  election.  The 
defection  of  many  former  PRI  stalwarts  and  the  threat  of  fur- 
ther erosion  of  the  party  ranks  also  placed  enormous  pressure 
on  Salinas  to  relax  the  economic  austerity  measures  put  in 
place  by  his  predecessor.  Compounding  the  new  government's 
problems  was  the  fact  that,  for  the  first  time  in  its  history,  the 
PRI  did  not  command  the  two-thirds  majority  in  the  Chamber 
of  Deputies  required  to  amend  the  constitution.  To  continue 
liberalizing  the  economy,  the  government  would  need  to  nego- 
tiate with  the  101  delegates  of  the  "moderate"  opposition  (the 
center-right  PAN)  to  remove  the  remaining  constitutional  bar- 
riers to  reform. 

Perhaps  the  most  formidable  political  challenge  faced  by  the 
new  Salinas  administration  was  mistrust  of  the  official  party's 
leadership  and  its  lack  of  credibility  among  a  likely  majority  of 
the  electorate  in  light  of  the  questionable  results  of  the  1988 
presidential  vote.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  narrow  PRI  presiden- 
tial victory  and  facing  widespread  charges  of  electoral  fraud, 
President  Salinas  sought  limited  reforms  of  the  electoral  pro- 
cess without  disavowing  the  PRI's  many  legal  and  financial 
advantages  in  the  political  system. 

Seeking  to  restore  the  government's  credibility  and  to  pacify 
the  opposition,  Salinas  increased  the  opportunities  for  opposi- 
tion politicians  to  take  office  at  the  state  and  local  levels.  This 
strategy  benefited  mainly  the  PAN,  whose  free-market  eco- 
nomic policies  closely  resembled  those  of  the  modernizing  tec- 
nicowing  of  the  PRI.  Whereas  previous  PRI  administrations  had 
been  willing  to  concede  some  municipalities  to  the  PAN,  the 
growth  of  opposition  strength  after  the  1988  ele  „tions  com- 
pelled the  PRI  to  begin  surrendering  state  goverr  ments  as  well. 

The  first  test  of  Salinas's  commitment  to  cl^  .ner  gubernato- 
rial elections  came  in  1989,  when  the  PRI  conceded  its  first  gov- 
ernorship to  an  opposition  party  by  accepting  a  PAN  victory  in 
Baja  California  Norte.  In  1991  PRI  victories  in  the  gubernato- 
rial elections  in  Guanajuato  and  San  Luis  Potosi  sparked  wide- 
spread allegations  of  fraud.  In  both  cases,  the  president 


266 


Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari, 
president,  1988-94 
Courtesy  Embassy  of  Mexico, 
Washington 


intervened  by  forcing  the  local  PRI  candidate  to  step  down. 
Whereas  in  San  Luis  Potosi  another  PRI  leader  was  installed  as 
interim  governor,  in  Guanajuato  the  interim  governorship  was 
handed  to  the  PAN  candidate. 

The  1992  gubernatorial  elections  in  Chihuahua  and  Micho- 
acan  illustrated  the  Salinas  administration's  ambivalent 
approach  toward  the  opposition  in  general.  Although  the  PAN 
candidate  won  and  was  allowed  to  take  office  in  Chihuahua, 
the  PRI  spent  vast  amounts  of  party  and  government  funds  to 
defeat  the  PRD  in  its  regional  stronghold  of  Michoacan.  Fol- 
lowing months  of  strident  PRD  protests  over  the  official  results, 
Salinas  faced  the  prospect  of  a  massive  protest  march  on 
Mexico  City.  The  president  was  finally  compelled  to  intervene 
and  replace  the  sitting  governor  with  a  more  suitable  PRI  sub- 
stitute. 

Although  President  Salinas's  rejection  of  overt  electoral 
fraud  was  by  no  means  novel  or  systematic,  his  admonitions 
concerning  fraud  in  state  and  local  elections  did  help  curb 
some  of  the  more  conspicuous  abuses.  In  addition,  the  presi- 
dent's moves  against  individuals  associated  with  corruption 
served  as  a  powerful  weapon  in  his  reformist  struggles  against 
the  most  recalcitrant  factions  of  the  PRI  old  guard.  Many  mem- 
bers of  the  PRI's  politico  wing  opposed  the  president's  economic 


267 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


policies  and  resented  central  government  interference  in  state 
and  local  politics. 

Contradicting  his  moves  on  behalf  of  more  transparent  and 
competitive  elections..  Salinas  took  some  measures  that  made  it 
more  difficult  for  the  opposition  to  contest  the  PRI's  public 
policy  initiatives.  In  the  name  of  preserving  "governability," 
Salinas  resorted  frequently  to  his  executive  prerogatives  in 
pushing  legislation  through  the  Congress  with  a  minimum  of 
public  debate.  Although  the  1990  electoral  reform  created 
institutions  and  a  legal  framework  to  fight  electoral  fraud  and 
abuses,  it  also  contained  a  new  formula  for  legislative  seating 
that  made  it  more  difficult  for  the  opposition  to  gain  seats  in 
the  Chamber  of  Deputies.  Under  the  1990  electoral  code,  the 
threshold  for  obtaining  an  automatic  majority  of  seats  in  the 
chamber  was  reduced  to  35  percent  of  the  national  vote.  This 
threshold  practically  ensured  that  any  future  PRI  administra- 
tion could  count  on  a  PRI-controlled  Chamber  of  Deputies  to 
pass  its  legislative  initiatives.  This  highly  unpopular  electoral 
law  was  rescinded  in  1994  during  the  reforms  leading  to  the 
August  elections. 

One  of  the  key  features  of  the  1990  electoral  code  was  the 
abolition  of  the  discredited  Federal  Electoral  Commission  and 
its  replacement  with  a  new  Federal  Electoral  Institute  (Instituto 
Federal  Electoral — IFE).  The  IFE  is  a  semiautononomous 
organization,,  consisting  of  representatives  from  government 
and  the  major  political  parties.  It  supervises  elections  and 
investigates  complaints  of  irregularities.  The  IFE  also  adminis- 
ters the  entire  electoral  process  at  the  federal,  state,  and  local 
levels.  During  the  earlv  1990s,  reforms  of  the  IFE  strengthened 
its  capacity  to  serve  as  a  nonpartisan  electoral  commission. 
These  reforms  included  the  introduction  of  majority  nonparti- 
san representation  (six  out  of  eleven  seats)  in  the  IFE  govern- 
ing: board,  a  le°;al  framework  for  Mexican  and  foreign 
observers  to  monitor  the  elections,  and  an  independent  audit 
of  the  national  voter  list.  Other  electoral  rules  implemented 
during  the  Salinas  sexenio  included  the  compilation  of  a  new 
and  more  accurate  national  electoral  roll,  and  the  issue  of  new 
voter  registration  cards  bearing  voter  photographs  and  finger- 
prints. 

The  Salinas  government  reform  program  was  twofold.  It 
focused  on  economic  growth  and  the  replacement  of  wide- 
ranging  subsidies  to  the  middle  class  by  a  welfare  program  tar- 
geted at  the  poorest  sectors  of  Mexican  society.  In  a  coordi- 


268 


Government  and  Politics 


nated  effort  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and  restructure  the 
economy,  Salinas  promoted  the  privatization  of  state  firms  that 
brought  more  than  US$10  billion  to  the  Mexican  government. 
The  administration  also  launched  an  active  campaign  to 
increase  foreign  investment  in  Mexico.  A  second  approach 
involved  the  massive  National  Solidarity  Program  (Programa 
Nacional  de  Solidaridad — Pronasol),  which  was  to  help  the 
poor  and  attract  political  support  (see  Social  Spending,  ch.  2). 
Pronasol  distributed  several  billion  dollars,  derived  from  priva- 
tization funds,  aimed  at  delivering  public  works  projects  to 
poor  areas  within  the  country.  Heavy  government  spending  on 
social  projects  (schools,  health  clinics,  and  roads,  among  oth- 
ers) contributed  to  PRI  victories  in  the  1991  midterm  elections. 

Two  important  events  in  1994  led  to  dramatic  political 
reforms.  First  came  the  Chiapas  rebellion  on  New  Year's  Day,  in 
which  an  army  of  some  2,000  peasants  led  by  the  masked  Sub- 
commander  Marcos  demanded  social  justice  and  democratiza- 
tion of  the  Mexican  political  system  (see  President  Salinas,  ch. 
1).  Two  months  later,  PRI  presidential  candidate  Colosio  was 
assassinated  while  campaigning  in  Tijuana. 

Despite  the  rhetoric  calling  for  political  reform  and  democ- 
ratization, President  Salinas  actually  strengthened  the  tradi- 
tional pattern  of  centralized  authority  in  the  decision-making 
process.  A  clear  example  of  the  continuation  of  the  dedazo  was 
the  tight  control  and  secrecy  around  the  unveiling  of  the  sec- 
ond PRI  presidential  candidate,  Zedillo,  soon  after  Colosio's 
assassination.  Critics  charged  that  much  of  the  effort  to  curb 
voting  fraud  stemmed  not  from  a  change  in  institutions  but 
from  the  personal  intervention  of  President  Salinas.  Electoral 
reform  was  also  inhibited  by  a  lack  of  meaningful  political  par- 
ticipation by  women  (who  did  not  attain  voting  rights  until 
1954)  and  by  ethnic  minorities.  Despite  the  glorification  of 
Mexico's  indigenous  history  in  popular  art  and  literature, 
Mexico's  indigenous  peoples  have  been  largely  marginalized  in 
national  politics. 

Foreign  Relations 

The  principles  of  Mexican  foreign  policy  are  respect  for 
international  law  and  the  judicial  equality  of  states,  respect  for 
the  sovereignty  and  independence  of  nations,  nonintervention 
in  the  domestic  affairs  of  other  countries,  the  peaceful  resolu- 
tion of  conflicts,  and  the  promotion  of  collective  security 
through  participation  in  international  organizations.  Tradi-

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

tionally,  Mexico's  foreign  policy  has  been  considered  leftist, 
prorevolutionary,  and  nationalistic.  Demonstrating  indepen- 
dence from  United  States  foreign  policy,  Mexico  supported  the 
Cuban  government  during  the  1960s,  the  Sandinista  (see  Glos- 
sary) revolution  in  Nicaragua  during  the  late  1970s,  and  leftist 
revolutionary  groups  in  El  Salvador  during  the  1980s. 

Mexico  has  played  a  minor  role  in  international  affairs 
through  most  of  its  history.  Since  the  mid-nineteenth  century, 
Mexican  foreign  policy  has  focused  primarily  on  the  United 
States,  its  northern  neighbor,  largest  trading  partner,  and  the 
most  powerful  actor  in  hemispheric  and  world  affairs.  Mexico's 
role  in  international  affairs  was  limited  until  the  1970s,  mainly 
because  of  the  country's  need  to  concentrate  on  domestic 
issues,  particularly  on  internal  stability  and  economic  growth. 

The  discovery  of  vast  petroleum  reserves  during  the  1970s, 
however,  placed  Mexico  in  the  forefront  of  oil  producers  and 
exporters.  Mexico  soon  became  the  principal  supplier  of  oil  to 
the  United  States  after  the  1973  energy  crisis.  The  heavy  inflow 
of  dollars  contributed  to  changing  Mexico's  perceptions  of  its 
role  in  world  affairs  while  increasing  its  potential  of  becoming 
an  important  regional  power.  Mexico  has  maintained  an  inde- 
pendent oil  policy,  however,  refusing  to  join  the  Organization 
of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  during  the 
1970s,  but  participating  in  the  Organization  of  Latin  American 
Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OLAPEC)  during  the  1980s. 

Beginning  with  the  presidency  of  Luis  Echeverria  (1970- 
76),  Mexico  developed  and  implemented  a  more  independent 
and  assertive  foreign  policy.  Following  an  activist  policy  inde- 
pendent of  the  United  States,  the  Echeverria  government 
asserted  Mexico's  position  as  a  leader  in  the  developing  world's 
affairs,  particularly  on  discussions  for  establishing  a  new  inter- 
national economic  order  as  part  of  the  so-called  "North-South 
Dialogue."  The  Echeverria  administration  boycotted  the  Gene- 
ral Assembly  meeting  of  the  Organization  of  American  States 
(OAS)  in  1973  to  protest  the  military  coup  in  Chile  that 
deposed  the  popularly  elected  government  of  Salvador  Allende 
Gossens  and  suspended  diplomatic  relations  with  Chile  and 
South  Africa  because  of  these  governments'  human  rights  vio- 
lations. The  Mexican  government  frequently  criticized  United 
States  foreign  policy  for  favoring  military  regimes  throughout 
the  Third  World.  Most  distinctively,  Mexico  adopted  an  aggres- 
sive role  as  a  leader  within  Latin  America  in  concerted  efforts 


270

president,  1994-

Washington 


to  adopt  a  unified  position  in  regional  relations  against  the 
United  States. 

During  the  late  1970s,  Mexico  broke  diplomatic  relations 
with  the  Somoza  regime  in  Nicaragua  on  the  advent  of  the  San- 
dinista  revolution  and  in  1980  joined  Venezuela  in  the  San  Jose 
Accords,  providing  favorable  trade  conditions  for  oil  supply  to 
the  depressed  economies  of  Caribbean  and  Central  American 
countries.  In  1983  Mexico  was  instrumental  in  the  establish- 
ment of  the  Contadora  (see  Glossary)  Group,  a  diplomatic 
effort  by  four  regional  governments  (Colombia,  Mexico,  Pan- 
ama, and  Venezuela)  to  present  a  Latin  American  solution  to 
the  crisis  in  Central  America.  The  document  developed  by  the 
Contadora  Group  was  instrumental  in  the  final  Central  Ameri- 
can Peace  Plan  (see  The  United  States  and  the  Crisis  in 
Mexico,  ch.  1). 

During  the  Salinas  administration,  the  central  theme  of 
Mexican  foreign  policy  became  free  trade,  especially  NAFTA. 
Mexico  focused  on  bilateral  discussions  with  countries  within 
the  hemisphere  in  an  effort  to  improve  trade  and  investment 
potential.  By  1994  it  had  signed  free-trade  agreements  with 
Venezuela  and  Colombia  (effective  January  1,  1995)  as  well  as 
with  Bolivia.  Under  President  Salinas,  Mexican  nationalism  was 
redefined  as  "progressive  nationalism,"  or  the  pursuit  of  eco- 


271

nomic  development  while  strengthening  Mexico's  interna- 
tional role.  Salinas  felt  that  national  independence  demanded 
that  Mexico  effectively  insert  itself  into  the  international  mar- 
ket. In  the  mid-1990s,  President  Ernesto  Zedillo  continued  to 
stress  Mexico's  strategic  position  and  market  potential  world- 
wide. 

Relations  with  the  United  States 

Throughout  its  history,  Mexico  has  had  an  ambivalent 
love-hate  relationship  with  its  northern  neighbor.  Nationalist 
rhetoric  continuously  highlights  the  loss  of  one-half  of 
Mexico's  territory  and  natural  resources  to  the  United  States  in 
the  1800s.  Even  at  times  when  United  States-Mexican  relations 
have  been  at  their  best,  this  loss  is  still  present  in  Mexican  rhet- 
oric. During  the  Rio  Group  summit  in  September  1994,  for 
example,  President  Salinas  commented  on  the  United 
Nations-sponsored  United  States  intervention  in  Haiti,  "Having 
suffered  an  external  intervention  by  the  United  States,  in 
which  we  lost  more  than  half  of  our  territory,  Mexico  cannot 
accept  any  proposal  for  intervention  by  any  nation  of  the 
region."  In  economic  terms,  good  relations  with  the  United 
States  have  long  been  critical  for  Mexico,  given  that  its  north- 
ern neighbor  is  its  principal  trading  partner,  both  for  exports 
and  imports.  For  its  part,  the  United  States  gives  serious  consid- 
eration to  its  relations  with  Mexico  because  of  Mexico's  strate- 
gic location  on  the  United  States  southern  border  as  well  as  the 
fact  that  Mexico  has  the  largest  oil  deposits  in  Latin  America. 

Relations  between  the  countries  often  have  been  character- 
ized by  conflict.  Analysts  attribute  much  of  the  antagonism  to 
the  great  disparities  in  wealth  between  the  two  countries;  a  his- 
tory of  intervention  by  the  United  States  that  makes  Mexico 
highly  critical  and  suspicious  of  United  States  positions;  cul- 
tural differences  and  stereotypes  of  both  nations;  and  the  high 
levels  of  interdependence  on  many  socioeconomic  and  politi- 
cal issues,  both  at  the  national  level  and  in  border  areas. 

In  the  past,  Mexico  defied  the  United  States  on  a  number  of 
crucial  hemispheric  issues.  Mexico  never  broke  relations  with 
the  Cuban  communist  regime  as  did  the  rest  of  Latin  America 
in  the  early  1960s.  During  President  Echeverna's  sexenio, 
Mexico  took  a  leading  role  in  demands  for  a  new  international 
economic  order.  During  the  1970s,  Mexico  challenged  the 
United  States  position  in  Central  America  and  led  a  concerted 
regional  effort  that  excluded  the  United  States  to  bring  a 


272 


Government  and  Politics 

peaceful  end  to  regional  conflicts.  During  the  1980s,  Mexico 
was  highly  critical  of  United  States  policy  in  El  Salvador  and, 
along  with  the  French  government,  called  for  formal  recogni- 
tion of  the  Salvadoran  guerrillas  in  the  peace  process. 

The  most  important  bilateral  issues  in  the  1990s  are  drugs, 
trade,  and  illegal  immigration  into  the  United  States.  Drug 
trafficking  is  a  pressing  issue  for  both  Mexico,  as  a  producer 
and  point  of  entry  of  the  drug  trade  from  South  America  into 
the  United  States  drug  market,  and  the  United  States,  as  a 
major  consumer.  Mexico  insists  that  the  trafficking  of  drugs 
would  not  exist  without  the  enormous  and  growing  market  in 
the  United  States,  thus  placing  responsibility  on  its  northern 
neighbor.  Nevertheless,  the  corruption  and  crime  provoked  by 
the  growing  drug  business  in  Mexico  have  led  the  Mexican  gov- 
ernment to  take  domestic  antidrug  measures.  The  Salinas  gov- 
ernment launched  a  massive  military  campaign  to  counter  the 
threat  posed  by  the  narcotics  trade  within  the  country.  In  1989 
Mexico  signed  a  cooperation  agreement  with  the  United  States 
on  fighting  the  illegal  drug  trade  (see  President  Salinas,  ch.  1). 
Mexico's  position  on  drug  trafficking  consists  of  two  major  con- 
tentions: Mexico  will  make  a  good-faith  effort  to  eradicate  the 
production  and  trade  of  drugs,  and  it  will  not,  under  any  cir- 
cumstances, allow  the  consolidation  of  narcotics  groups  within 
its  territory.  Currently,  Mexico  has  a  large  portion  of  its  army 
involved  in  the  government's  drug  eradication  program  (see 
Narcotics  Trafficking,  ch.  5). 

Trade  between  the  two  nations  remains  an  important  issue. 
A  trade  and  environmental  agreement  signed  in  late  1989 
paved  the  way  for  an  expansion  of  bilateral  trade  and  invest- 
ment with  the  United  States.  In  1990  Mexico  began  negotia- 
tions over  NAFTA  with  the  United  States  and  Canada.  The 
main  objective  of  NAFTA  was  to  remove  all  trade  barriers  and 
investment  obstacles  among  the  three  countries  over  a 
fifteen-year  period.  Negotiations  concluded  in  1992,  and 
NAFTA  was  approved  in  1993.  The  agreement  was  activated  on 
January  1,  1994,  creating  the  world's  richest  and  largest  trading 
bloc,  consisting  of  360  million  consumers  in  a  US$6.6  trillion 
market  (see  Foreign  Trade,  ch.  3). 

A  third  pressing  issue  between  the  two  countries  continues 
to  be  illegal  immigration  of  Mexicans  into  the  United  States.  By 
the  mid-1990s,  this  issue  occupied  center  stage  in  United 
States-Mexican  relations.  Since  the  1960s,  the  number  of  Mexi- 
can illegal  immigrants  into  the  United  States  has  soared  to  an 


273 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


average  of  300,000  to  500,000  per  year.  These  groups  are  con- 
centrated in  the  southwestern  states  of  the  United  States,  espe- 
cially California.  Although  NAFTA  may  help  to  decrease  this 
trend  in  the  long  run,  the  presence  of  a  large  number  of  illegal 
residents  in  the  United  States — many  of  whom  benefit  from 
local  and  federal  programs — triggered  a  legislative  proposal  in 
1995  in  the  state  of  California  to  deprive  these  groups  of  any 
United  States  government  support.  In  particular,  legislation  in 
the  state  of  California  has  revived  anti-United  States  feelings 
among  Mexicans. 

Relations  with  Cuba 

Mexican  policy  toward  Cuba  has  been  the  cornerstone  of  its 
assertive  independence  from  United  States  policies.  Mexico's 
closeness  with  Cuba  also  set  it  apart  from  its  Latin  American 
neighbors,  especially  in  the  1960s  when  Mexico  was  the  only 
Latin  American  country  that  did  not  break  diplomatic  relations 
with  the  Cuban  government.  Mexico  also  opposed  any  foreign 
interference  in  Cuban  affairs,  including  the  United  States- 
backed  Bay  of  Pigs  invasion  in  1961  and  the  expulsion  of  Cuba 
from  international  organizations — for  example,  the  suspension 
of  Cuba  from  the  OAS  in  1962.  As  part  of  asserting  Mexican 
independence  from  United  States  policy  toward  Cuba,  the 
Mexican  president  pays  an  official  visit  to  Cuba  during  the  last 
year  of  his  term.  This  practice  was  established  by  President 
Echeverna  in  1975  and  continued  by  presidents  Lopez  Porullo 
in  1980,  de  la  Madrid  in  1988,  and  Salinas  in  1994.  Mexico  and 
Cuba  currently  hold  many  formal  agreements  on  economic, 
educational,  and  cultural  issues. 

Relations  with  Guatemala 

Mexico's  shared  border  with  Guatemala  has  led  to  tensions 
between  the  countries.  Because  of  the  disparity  between  the 
two  countries  in  economic  levels  and  power,  some  critics  draw 
parallels  to  United  States-Mexican  relations.  Traditionally,  Gua- 
temalans have  crossed  the  border  seasonally  to  work  in  the  cof- 
fee fields  of  southern  Mexico.  During  the  early  1980s,  however, 
a  military  campaign  against  indigenous  Mayan  peasants  in 
northern  Guatemala  forced  an  exodus  of  refugees,  who 
crossed  the  Mexican  border  to  get  away  from  the  violent  dis- 
placement of  their  communities.  From  1982  to  1993,  more 
than  40,000  Maya  lived  in  refugee  camps  along  the  southern 
border  of  Mexico,  creating  a  problem  for  local  authorities.  The 


274 


Government  and  Politics 


Mexican  government,  at  both  the  national  and  local  levels,  was 
unprepared  and  unwilling  to  support  such  mass  immigration 
into  its  territory.  The  emergence  of  the  Zapatista  guerrilla 
movement  and  alleged  drug  trafficking  in  the  region  exacer- 
bated the  situation.  The  Mexican  government  was  criticized  for 
its  neglect  and  selectiveness  regarding  political  asylum  issues. 
Repatriation  agreements  between  the  Guatemalan  government 
and  organized  refugee  groups  were  reached  during  1992,  pro- 
viding for  the  return  of  these  groups  to  their  country.  Repatria- 
tion has  proceeded  slowly  since  then. 

Relations  with  Other  Latin  American  Countries 

Mexico  is  a  founding  and  active  member  of  various  hemi- 
spheric fora  that  support  regional  political  and  economic 
cooperation  within  Latin  America.  Mexico  is,  for  example,  a 
founding  member  of  the  OAS  and  the  Inter-American  Treaty 
of  Reciprocal  Assistance  (Rio  Treaty).  But  although  Mexico  is 
an  active  participant  in  many  regional  organizations,  it  main- 
tains an  independent  view  and  often  dissents  from  decisions 
taken  by  the  international  forum.  Its  record  within  the  OAS 
consistently  shows  an  independent  Mexican  policy:  Mexico  dis- 
sented from  the  United  States-sponsored  1954  Caracas  Resolu- 
tion, which  was  directed  at  the  leftist  government  of  Jacobo 
Arbenz  Guzman  in  Guatemala;  it  systematically  opposed  the 
United  States-led  imposition  by  the  OAS  of  economic  sanctions 
against  Cuba  during  the  1960s;  and  it  opposed  United  States 
interventions  in  the  Dominican  Republic  (1965),  Grenada 
(1983),  Panama  (1990),  and  Haiti  (1994). 

Through  most  of  the  1980s,  Mexico  was  among  the  leaders 
of  an  intra-Latin  American  cooperation  effort  that  excluded 
the  United  States.  As  a  member  of  the  Contadora  Group  estab- 
lished in  1983  with  Colombia,  Panama,  and  Venezuela,  Mexico 
advocated  a  negotiated  settlement  of  the  Central  American 
conflict  and  called  for  the  withdrawal  of  foreign  influence — 
including  that  of  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union — 
from  the  region.  Mexico  was  also  a  founding  member  of  the 
Cartagena  Group  (1984),  an  informal  Latin  American  forum 
established  to  deal  collectively  with  issues  concerning  foreign 
debt.  Along  with  Venezuela,  Mexico  established  the  San  Jose 
Accords,  a  cooperative  effort  to  supply  Central  American 
nations,  Barbados,  the  Dominican  Republic,  and  Jamaica  with 
oil  on  concessionary  terms.  Currently,  Mexico  is  an  active  par- 
ticipant in  the  Group  of  Eight  (derived  from  the  Contadora 


275 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Group),  which  includes  Argentina,  Brazil,  Colombia,  Mexico, 
Panama,  Peru,  Uruguay,  and  Venezuela;  and  in  the  Group  of 
Three,  along  with  Colombia  and  Venezuela. 

Membership  in  International  Organizations 

Mexico  has  always  been  a  staunch  supporter  of  international 
cooperation  through  multilateral  institutions.  Mexico  main- 
tains diplomatic  relations  with  176  countries.  Mexico  also  is  a 
founding  member  of  the  United  Nations  and  participates  as  an 
active  member  in  more  than  seventy  other  international  fora, 
including  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT; 
now  the  World  Trade  Organization — WTO),  the  Organisation 
for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  the 
Asia  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  forum,  NAFTA, 
and  the  Rio  Group.  In  addition,  the  Mexican  government  was 
among  the  leading  members  of  the  Inter-American  System  that 
drafted  the  Treaty  of  Tlatelolco,  which  prohibits  Latin  Ameri- 
can countries  from  acquiring  nuclear  weapons. 

Prospects  for  the  Future 

The  presidential  election  of  1994  was  unlike  any  election  of 
the  twentieth  century.  With  more  than  80,000  Mexican  observ- 
ers and  1,000  foreign  poll  watchers  stationed  around  the  coun- 
try, the  1994  presidential  election  was,  by  far,  the  most  open 
and  honest  in  modern  Mexican  history  A  high  voter  turnout 
(70  percent  of  the  electorate)  provided  credibility  to  the  elec- 
tion process  and  confirmed  the  government's  commitment  to, 
and  the  legitimacy  of,  democratic  practices  in  Mexico.  In  his 
campaign,  the  new  Mexican  president,  albeit  representing  the 
traditional  forces  within  the  official  party,  promised  to  divert 
powers  from  the  executive  branch  to  the  other  two  branches  of 
government.  He  also  promised  to  democratize  the  PRI's  presi- 
dential selection  process. 

Although  significant  changes  during  the  1990s  have  contrib- 
uted to  the  development  of  a  more  competitive  and  demo- 
cratic Mexican  political  system,  a  strong  executive  branch,  as 
well  as  a  close  connection  between  the  PRI  and  the  govern- 
ment, continues  to  prevail  as  the  official  party  enters  its  seventh 
decade  in  power.  Most  analysts  agree  that  the  period  of  PRI 
hegemony  is  over.  The  outcome  of  this  new  pluralism,  however, 
is  a  matter  for  conjecture.  Mexico  today  faces  the  challenge  of 
maintaining  political  and  economic  stability  while  pursuing  a 


276

dramatic  transition  toward  an  open  economy  and  a  competi- 
tive, pluralist  political  system.

The  body  of  work  on  Mexican  politics  is  extensive.  Recent

Political  System.  Roger  Hansen's  The  Politics  of  Mexican  Develop- 
ment, although  becoming  dated,  continues  to  provide  the  best 
analysis  of  the  PRI.  The  articles  on  Mexico  in  Latin  America  and 
Caribbean  Contemporary  Record  provide  useful  information  on 
political  and  economic  events,  as  do  the  articles  on  Mexico  in

Chapter  5.  National  Security 


Mexican  revolutionary  soldiers  adapted  from  a  painting  by  David  Alfaro 
Siquieros 


MEXICO'S  EXTERNAL  SECURITY  ENVIRONMENT  is  peace- 
ful. Mexico  has  no  foreign  adversaries  and  little  ambition  to 
impose  itself  upon  other  nations.  It  repudiates  the  use  of  force 
to  settle  disputes  and  rejects  interference  by  one  nation  in  the 
affairs  of  another.  It  sees  no  regional  security  problems  justify- 
ing military  alliances. 

The  traditional  Mexican  definition  of  national  security  has 
constrained  the  role  played  by  the  armed  forces.  The  military  is 
essentially  passive  in  matters  of  external  defense.  It  has  been 
relegated  to  internal  missions  of  guaranteeing  domestic  politi- 
cal stability,  contributing  to  the  antinarcotics  campaign,  and 
carrying  out  development-oriented  civic-action  programs  in 
fulfillment  of  its  duties  as  the  "servant  of  the  people."  Since  the 
end  of  World  War  II,  a  succession  of  civilian  presidents  has 
divested  the  military  establishment  of  political  power.  The  rul- 
ing civilian  elite  that  guides  national  security  policy  focuses  on 
maintaining  social  order  and  overcoming  local  uprisings. 

Because  of  these  limited  national  security  goals,  Mexico  long 
maintained  a  military  establishment  that  was  relatively  small  for 
a  regional  power.  The  picture  began  to  change  in  the  late 
1970s,  however.  The  discovery  and  exploitation  of  new  petro- 
leum reserves  gave  Mexico  added  stature  as  a  world  energy  sup- 
plier. Violence  in  Central  America  brought  tens  of  thousands 
of  refugees,  mainly  Guatemalans,  to  Mexico.  This  influx  of  ref- 
ugees was  part  of  a  regional  upheaval  that  Mexico  feared  might 
spread  northward  to  Mexican  soil.  Given  the  situation,  the 
nation's  armed  forces,  which  until  the  1970s  were  one  of  the 
most  poorly  paid  and  ill-equipped  in  the  Western  Hemisphere, 
took  on  new  significance. 

As  a  result,  Mexico  launched  an  ambitious  military  modern- 
ization program  with  the  goals  of  increasing  the  size  of  the 
armed  forces,  improving  education  and  training,  and  upgrad- 
ing military  equipment.  The  plan  had  to  be  scaled  back 
because  of  a  serious  international  financial  crisis  and  domestic 
economic  distress  in  the  1980s,  but  important  changes  were 
realized.  The  number  of  armed  services  personnel  doubled  in 
less  than  two  decades,  reaching  175,000  in  1996.  In  addition  to 
keeping  independent  regiments  and  battalions  in  garrisons 
throughout  the  country,  the  army  formed  an  armored  brigade, 
bringing  its  combat  forces  to  six  brigades.  There  was  also  an

elite  Presidential  Guard  brigade.  The  army  also  enlarged  its 
inventory  of  armored  vehicles,  although  it  still  had  no  tanks. 
The  air  force  expanded  by  adding  a  jet  fighter  squadron,  in 
addition  to  less  sophisticated  planes,  and  armed  helicopters 
that  have  been  used  in  counterinsurgency  operations.  The 
navy  acquired  modern  patrol  vessels  to  provide  increased  pro- 
tection of  offshore  oil  installations  and  the  country's  fishery 
resources. 

Violence  in  nearby  Central  American  countries  slackened  in 
the  early  1990s.  A  1994  peasant  rebellion  in  the  southernmost 
state  of  Chiapas,  however,  demonstrated  the  potential  for  revo- 
lutionary activity  by  people  not  sharing  in  the  country's  eco- 
nomic and  social  progress.  Although  the  lightly  armed 
insurgents  inflicted  relatively  few  casualties,  troop  units  were 
heavily  deployed  in  the  area.  The  possibility  that  localized 
uprisings  could  become  more  widespread  underscores  the 
need  for  modern,  well-trained  armed  forces  to  ensure  the 
country's  stability. 

History  and  Traditions  of  the  Armed  Forces 

Mexico's  military  claims  a  rich  heritage  dating  back  to  the 
pre-Columbian  era.  As  early  as  the  beginning  of  the  fifteenth 
century,  the  Aztec  army  achieved  a  high  degree  of  military 
organization  that  included  formal  education  and  training, 
weapons  production,  war  planning,  and  the  execution  of  coor- 
dinated operations  (see  The  Aztec,  ch.  1).  The  importance  of 
military  service  was  impressed  upon  each  young  male  in  the  rit- 
ual of  declaring  to  him,  shortly  after  birth,  that  his  destiny  was 
to  be  a  warrior  and  to  die  in  combat,  the  most  honorable  death 
in  Aztec  culture.  The  powers  of  the  Triple  Alliance,  formed  by 
the  urban  centers  of  Tenochtitlan,  Texcoco,  and  Tlacopan 
(now  known  as  Tacuba) — all  three  of  which  are  in  the  area  of 
present-day  Mexico  City — reportedly  could  assemble  a  force  of 
between  16,000  and  18,000  combatants,  roughly  10  percent  of 
the  male  population,  on  an  hour's  notice.  Evidence  of  this 
indigenous  influence  on  the  modern  military  is  found  in  the 
profile  of  an  eagle  warrior,  the  name  given  Aztec  society's  fight- 
ing elite,  on  the  insignia  of  the  Superior  War  College  (Escuela 
Superior  de  Guerra). 

At  the  beginning  of  the  sixteenth  century,  the  forces  of  the 
Triple  Alliance  were  at  the  peak  of  their  military  development. 
Nevertheless,  when  the  Spanish  conquistadors  under  Hernan 
Cortes  arrived  in  1519,  the  native  warriors  put  up  little  resis-

tance.  The  two  decisive  factors  in  the  Spanish  victories  were  the 
conquistadors'  possession  of  firearms  and  the  mobility  they 
gained  from  horses,  elements  of  battle  hitherto  unknown  to 
the  Aztec.  The  cruelty  of  the  Spanish  induced  the  Aztec  to 
rebel  in  1520,  and  Cortes  was  forced  to  abandon  the  Aztec  cap- 
ital of  Tenochtitlan.  After  launching  a  new  offensive,  the  Span- 
ish regained  control,  destroying  the  magnificent  city  (see  The 
Spanish  Conquest,  ch.  1).  An  alliance  with  indigenous  peoples 
opposed  to  the  Aztec;  the  belief  of  Aztec  ruler  Moctezuma  II 
(Montezuma)  that  Cortes  was  a  Toltec  god,  Quetzalcoatl, 
whose  return  was  predicted  by  legend;  and  the  rapid  spread  of 
smallpox,  which  had  been  carried  by  the  Spanish,  also  contrib- 
uted to  the  Spanish  victory  Despite  the  Aztec's  continued  bat- 
tles and  subterfuge,  the  Spanish  succeeded  in  superimposing 
their  own  theocratic-militaristic  traditions  on  the  conquered 
society. 

The  Spanish  organized  the  new  colony  as  the  Viceroyalty  of 
New  Spain  and  established  an  army  there  in  the  latter  part  of 
the  eighteenth  century.  By  1800  the  army's  main  components 
were  four  infantry  regiments  and  two  dragoon  regiments 
rotated  periodically  from  Spain.  These  were  supported  by  ten 
militia  regiments  of  infantry  and  nine  regiments  of  dragoons 
recruited  locally.  In  all,  the  army  numbered  about  30,000  mem- 
bers. 

After  independence,  the  Mexican  armed  forces  gradually 
eliminated  many  practices  of  the  Spanish  colonial  army.  The 
practice  of  granting  military  officers  special  rights  or  privileges 
(Jueros)  that  enabled  them  to  "make  sport  of  justice,  avoid  pay- 
ment of  their  debts,  establish  gambling  houses,  and  lead  a  dis- 
solute life  under  the  protection  of  their  epaulets"  was 
abolished  in  1855.  The  military  also  phased  out  the  nine- 
teenth-century practice  of  forced  conscription,  which  often 
filled  the  ranks  with  criminals  or  other  social  undesirables 
whom  local  caudillos  (strongmen)  wished  to  be  rid  of.  These 
practices  led  to  a  sharp  division  between  the  officer  corps  and 
the  enlisted  ranks,  a  division  that  has  slowly  abated  in  the  twen- 
tieth century  in  response  to  the  egalitarian  influence  and 
myths  of  the  Mexican  Revolution  (1910-20).  Two  legacies  still 
remain  from  the  years  of  colonial  rule,  however:  the  use  of 
Spanish  military  ranks,  some  of  which  have  no  direct  equiva- 
lent in  the  United  States  armed  forces,  and  the  high  prestige 
traditionally  accorded  to  cavalry  units.

The  Wars  of  Independence,  1810-21 

According  to  one  historical  account,  the  struggle  for  inde- 
pendence involved  four  phases  of  military  operations.  In  the 
first  phase,  Father  Miguel  Hidalgo  y  Costilla,  a  parish  priest, 
formed  the  precursor  of  the  first  independent  Mexican  mili- 
tary force  when  he  issued  the  now-famous  Grito  de  Dolores  on 
September  16,  1810,  calling  for  an  end  to  Spanish  rule  (see 
Wars  of  Independence,  1810-21,  ch.  1).  Hidalgo  led  a  poorly 
armed  force  of  native  and  mestizo  peasants  in  disorganized 
attacks  on  Spanish-controlled  towns  and  villages  throughout 
central  Mexico.  The  second  phase  began  after  Hidalgo's  cap- 
ture and  execution  in  1811,  when  Father  Jose  Mana  Morelos  y 
Pavon  assumed  leadership  of  the  independence  movement. 
Morelos  led  guerrilla-style  operations  at  the  head  of  a  small 
army  equipped  with  weapons  captured  from  the  Spanish.  He 
was  able  to  establish  an  independent  republic  from  central 
Mexico  to  the  Pacific  coast  and  to  encircle  Mexico  City  by  early 
1813.  The  third  phase,  following  Morelos's  capture  and  execu- 
tion in  1815,  consisted  of  attacks  by  uncoordinated  rebel  bands 
led  by  guerrilla  chieftains — among  them  Guadalupe  (Manuel 
Felix  Fernandez)  Victoria  and  Vicente  Guerrero,  both  of 
whom  later  became  presidents.  Their  operations  further 
undermined  Spanish  control. 

The  final  phase  of  the  independence  struggle  began  in 
1821,  when  a  loyalist  officer,  Augustin  de  Iturbide,  revolted 
against  his  superiors  and  formed  a  tenuous  military  alliance 
with  Guerrero.  The  temporary  establishment  of  a  liberal  mon- 
archy in  Spain  had  provoked  many  Mexican  conservatives  like 
Iturbide  to  switch  their  sympathies  to  the  revolutionaries.  Itur- 
bide's  Army  of  the  Three  Guarantees,  composed  of  approxi- 
mately 16,000  men,  quickly  succeeded  in  routing  those  of  the 
regular  Spanish  forces  who  resisted  (see  Iturbide  and  the  Plan 
of  Iguala,  ch.  1).  Full  independence  in  1821  was  followed  by 
the  1822  coronation  of  Iturbide  as  the  "constitutional 
emperor"  of  Mexico.  The  revolutionary  force  became  the  first 
standing  Mexican  military  body.  Known  as  the  Mexican  Impe- 
rial Army,  it  was  almost  an  exact  copy  of  the  Spanish  colonial 
militia.  Its  officers  were  of  direct  Spanish  descent,  but  the  rank 
and  file  were  mainly  peasants  recruited  by  raids  on  villages  in 
the  mountains  and  brought  down  in  chains  to  the  cities.  The 
desertion  rate  was  high  among  these  "recruits,"  who  remained 
ill-trained  and  poorly  equipped  for  military  action. 


284 


National  Security 


For  the  first  thirty  years  following  independence,  military 
officers  dominated  the  country's  chaotic  political  life  (see 
Empire  and  the  Early  Republic,  1821-55,  ch.  1).  Repeatedly, 
groups  of  generals  led  by  a  caudillo  issued  "pronouncements" 
(pronunciamientos)  denouncing  the  government  and  promising 
reform  and  rewards  for  those  who  would  join  their  revolt.  One 
of  the  most  vilified  and  cunning  of  the  military  caudillos  was 
General  Antonio  Lopez  de  Santa  Anna  Perez  de  Lebron,  who 
led  the  first  revolt  against  Iturbide  and,  between  1833  and 
1855,  served  as  president  on  eleven  different  occasions. 

War  with  the  United  States,  1846 

In  spite  of  his  military  talents,  Santa  Anna  is  most  remem- 
bered for  his  defeats  that  led  to  the  cession  of  roughly  one-half 
of  Mexican  territory  to  the  United  States  under  the  1848  peace 
settlement  (see  Centralism  and  the  Caudillo  State,  1836-55, 
ch.  1).  After  Texas  declared  its  independence  in  1836,  Texan 
forces  initially  suffered  a  series  of  military  reverses  that  culmi- 
nated in  the  disaster  at  the  Alamo  in  San  Antonio.  But  later, 
bolstered  by  volunteer  fighters  from  throughout  the  United 
States,  they  soundly  defeated  the  Mexicans  and  captured  Santa 
Anna  at  the  Battle  of  San  Jacinto.  After  nine  years  of  indepen- 
dence (unrecognized  by  Mexico),  Texas  was  admitted  to  the 
United  States  in  1845.  The  next  year,  the  administration  of 
President  James  K.  Polk,  eager  to  fulfill  the  United  States  claim 
to  "manifest  destiny,"  found  a  pretext  to  declare  war  on 
Mexico.  After  occupying  Santa  Fe  without  a  struggle,  United 
States  forces  under  General  Stephen  Kearney  advanced  west  to 
present-day  California,  while  forces  under  Alexander  Doniplan 
occupied  Chihuahua.  Another  United  States  force  under 
General  Zachary  Taylor  defeated  Santa  Anna's  army  at  the  Bat- 
tle of  Buena  Vista  near  Monterrey.  The  decisive  battles,  how- 
ever, were  waged  by  General  Winfield  Scott's  15,000-man  Army 
of  Occupation  after  it  opened  another  front  by  landing  at  Ver- 
acruz. Scott's  army  continued  toward  the  Mexican  capital,  win- 
ning a  series  of  engagements  with  Santa  Anna,  who  had 
assumed  the  Mexican  presidency.  United  States  forces  took 
Mexico  City  after  a  three-week  siege  that  culminated  in  the 
decisive  Battle  of  Chapultepec.  By  Mexican  accounts,  some 
1,100  Mexican  troops  and  cadets  fought  in  hand-to-hand  com- 
bat against  7,000  United  States  soldiers  at  Chapultepec  Castle, 
the  site  of  the  Heroic  Military  College  on  the  western  outskirts 
of  the  city.  The  legend  of  the  Boy  Heroes  (Nihos  Heroes)  was 


285 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

born  when  young  cadets,  among  the  last  defenders  of 
Chapultepec,  reputedly  threw  themselves  over  the  ramparts  to 
their  deaths  rather  than  surrender  to  Scott's  troops. 

The  internal  disorder  that  followed  Mexico's  defeat 
depleted  the  country's  treasury  and  destroyed  much  of  its  com- 
merce and  agriculture.  Mounting  unpaid  foreign  debts  created 
a  pretext  for  Britain,  France,  and  Spain  to  land  troops  at  Vera- 
cruz in  1861.  Dreaming  of  expanding  his  influence  to  the  New 
World,  the  French  ruler,  Napoleon  III,  sent  an  expeditionary 
force  inland  to  capture  Mexico  City  in  early  1862.  Although  ini- 
tially defeated  at  the  bloody  Battle  of  Puebla  on  May  5,  1862, 
the  French,  aided  by  Mexican  conservative  troops,  eventually 
succeeded  in  installing  the  Habsburg  archduke  Ferdinand 
Maximilian  Joseph  as  the  second  emperor  of  Mexico  (see  Civil 
War  and  the  French  Intervention,  1855-67,  ch.  1).  By  late 
1862,  the  legitimate  government  of  Benito  Juarez  was  left  with 
control  of  only  a  small  enclave  along  the  border  with  Texas. 

General  Jose  de  la  Cruz  Porfirio  Diaz  had  played  a  decisive 
role  in  the  early  victory  of  Juarez's  forces  at  Puebla  and  com- 
manded troops  in  the  republican  stronghold  of  Oaxaca  until  it 
was  captured  by  the  French  in  1865.  After  escaping  from  a 
French  military  prison,  Diaz  commanded  republican  troops  in 
the  final  campaigns  leading  to  the  surrender  of  Maximilian's 
remaining  forces  at  Queretaro  in  1867.  After  Juarez  was 
returned  to  the  presidency,  Diaz  managed  to  slowly  parlay  his 
military  prowess  into  political  strength. 

Diaz's  allegiance  to  Juarez  ended  soon  after  the  restoration 
of  the  republic  when  the  newly  reinstalled  president  dis- 
charged two-thirds  of  the  60,000-  to  90,000-member  army.  Dur- 
ing the  next  several  years,  Diaz  championed  the  cause  of  the 
dismissed  troops  and  unsuccessfully  challenged  Juarez  in  the 
1867  and  1871  presidential  elections.  The  presidential  succes- 
sion after  Juarez's  death  finally  provoked  Diaz  to  move  against 
the  government  by  issuing  the  1876  Plan  of  Tuxtepec.  Using 
recruits  and  funds  gathered  in  the  United  States,  Diaz  defeated 
the  government  troops  and,  in  November  of  that  year,  assumed 
the  presidency,  a  position  he  would  hold  for  all  but  four  of  the 
next  thirty-four  years  (see  The  Restoration,  1867-76,  ch.  1). 

Established  as  the  national  caudillo,  Diaz  based  his  power  on 
military  might  as  he  ruthlessly  eliminated  those  who  chal- 
lenged his  authority.  When  the  United  States  and  Mexico  came 
close  to  war  in  1877  over  raids  into  United  States  territory  by 
Mexican  bandits  and  cattle  rustlers,  Diaz  halted  the  brigandage 


286 


National  Security 


and  averted  war  by  sending  in  federal  army  troops  and  the 
rurales,  the  feared  paramilitary  corps  composed  largely  of  crim- 
inals that  also  served  as  a  counterweight  to  the  regular  mili- 
tary's power.  Diaz  resumed  the  practice  of  forced  conscription 
and  used  his  troops  to  brutally  suppress  antigovernment  riots 
in  Mexico  City.  Although  state  governorships  were  regularly 
offered  to  loyal  officers,  Diaz  rotated  the  command  of  the 
army's  military  zones  as  a  means  of  preventing  generals  from 
acquiring  a  local  power  base. 

The  Military  Phase  of  the  Revolution,  1910-17 

Opposition  to  Diaz  grew  during  the  later  years  of  Diaz's  rule, 
and  liberal  reformers  rose  against  Diaz  in  1910,  following  yet 
another  fraudulent  reelection.  Using  the  United  States  as  a 
base  of  operations,  the  liberal  democratic  opposition  forces 
laid  siege  to  the  federal  garrison  at  Ciudad  Juarez.  Diaz's  liberal 
presidential  opponent,  Francisco  I.  Madero,  issued  a  manifesto 
in  San  Antonio,  Texas,  declaring  himself  provisional  president 
and  creating  the  Army  of  Liberation,  which  later  became  the 
Constitutionalist  Army  (see  The  Revolution,  1910-20,  ch.  1). 

Regional  caudillos,  some  of  whom  were  little  more  than  ban- 
dits, soon  joined  the  movement.  Rebels  led  by  Pascual  Orozco 
and  Francisco  (Pancho)  Villa,  armed  with  Winchester  rifles 
smuggled  from  the  United  States,  quickly  gained  the  advantage 
over  federal  troops,  who  depended  on  long  supply  lines  from 
the  capital.  As  rebel  successes  mounted,  government  troops 
began  deserting.  Under  pressure,  Diaz  resigned  in  1911  and 
fled  to  exile  in  France. 

The  Madero  government,  which  succeeded  Diaz,  was  forced 
to  deal  with  uprisings  throughout  the  country.  Rebel  military 
leaders  (most  notably  Orozco)  were  dissatisfied  with  the 
rewards  that  the  new  Madero  government  offered  them  for 
defeating  the  dictatorship.  A  coup  ousted  Madero  in  1913  and 
set  the  Mexican  Revolution  on  a  bloody  course  that  would  last 
for  the  next  four  years. 

Various  rival  factions  struggled  for  supremacy  in  confused 
fighting.  The  principal  leaders  were  Villa,  Orozco,  Emiliano 
Zapata,  Venusuano  Carranza,  and  Alvaro  Obregon.  Villa  delib- 
erately provoked  United  States  intervention  by  launching 
cross-border  raids.  A  7,000-man  expeditionary  force  under 
United  States  General  John  J.  "Blackjack"  Pershing  was  dis- 
patched in  1916  but  failed  to  capture  Villa.  In  spite  of  the  cha- 
otic conditions,  the  military  phase  of  the  Mexican  Revolution 


287 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


provided  the  Mexican  armed  forces  with  a  unifying  ideology. 
This  new  ideology  stressed  the  military's  peasant  origins  and 
established  the  military  as  the  defender  of  the  popular  will. 
Drawing  on  this  heritage,  the  modern  Mexican  military  identi- 
fies itself  as  the  "silent  and  anonymous  guardian"  that  has  pro- 
vided the  security  essential  to  the  subsequent  development  of 
the  nation. 

Professionalization  of  the  Armed  Forces,  1920-46 

The  first  serious  efforts  at  depoliticizing  and  professionaliz- 
ing the  military  began  in  1920  under  the  government  of 
Obregon,  himself  a  general  who  had  been  elected  president 
with  the  support  of  the  old  revolutionary  chiefs.  Obregon  saw 
the  need  to  consolidate  his  political  position  by  diminishing 
the  power  and  influence  of  the  regional  caudillos.  Military 
uprisings  in  1923,  1927,  and  1929  resulted  in  purges  of  large 
numbers  of  rebellious  generals.  The  army  was  reduced  by  two- 
thirds,  to  14,000  officers  and  70,000  troops  in  1921.  The  demo- 
bilization principally  dismantled  the  excessive  number  of  cav- 
alry regiments.  Pay  and  living  conditions  of  the  enlisted  ranks 
were  improved,  and  the  military's  share  of  the  national  budget 
was  slashed  from  61  percent  in  1921  to  25  percent  by  1926. 
Many  officers  and  men  were  weeded  out  by  new  laws  on  com- 
petitive promotion  and  mandatory  retirement  ages.  Neverthe- 
less, unqualified  revolutionary-era  generals  continued  to  be 
carried  on  the  rolls.  The  Organic  Law  of  1926  provided  the 
legal  base  for  the  army,  defined  its  missions,  and  established 
regulations  and  formal  procedures. 

General  Plutarco  Elfas  Calles  (president,  1924—28)  contin- 
ued Obregon's  efforts  to  reduce  the  political  influence  of  the 
military  and  ensure  the  army's  loyalty  to  the  central  govern- 
ment. Calles's  policies  were  carried  out  by  General  Joaquin 
Amaro,  the  secretary  of  war  and  navy.  Amaro  promoted  educa- 
tion of  officers  and  enlisted  men  in  the  belief  that  it  would 
increase  loyalty  and  obedience  to  civilian  authorities.  Officers 
were  sent  for  professional  training  in  the  United  States  and 
Western  Europe.  The  curriculum  of  the  Heroic  Military  Col- 
lege, founded  in  1823,  was  reformed,  and  the  Superior  War 
College,  a  command  and  general  staff  college  for  promising 
officers,  was  created.  Schools  providing  specialized  training  in 
the  various  service  branches  also  were  established  (see  Educa- 
tion and  Training,  this  ch.).

National  Security 


General  Lazaro  Cardenas,  who  assumed  the  presidency  in 
1934,  divided  the  Secretariat  of  War  and  the  Navy  into  two 
autonomous  defense  ministries,  the  Secretariat  of  National 
Defense  (Secretaria  de  Defensa  Nacional),  which  controlled 
the  army  and  air  force,  and  the  Secretariat  of  the  Navy  (Secre- 
taria de  Marina  Armada).  As  the  possibility  of  Mexican  involve- 
ment in  World  War  II  increased,  Cardenas  drafted  the  Law  of 
National  Military  Service,  which  established,  through  a  lottery 
system,  compulsory  basic  military  training  for  eighteen-year- 
old  males. 

The  Mexican  Military  in  World  War  II 

General  Manuel  Avila  Camacho,  who  came  to  office  in  1940 
and  was  the  last  general  elected  president  of  Mexico,  contin- 
ued Cardenas's  and  Obregon's  efforts  to  institutionalize  the 
army  and  remove  the  military  from  politics.  In  February  1942, 
soon  after  the  Japanese  attack  on  United  States  forces  at  Pearl 
Harbor,  the  Joint  Mexican-United  States  Commission  on  Conti- 
nental Defense  was  established.  The  commission  coordinated 
planning  for  the  defense  of  Mexico  and  the  adjacent  south- 
western United  States.  The  sinking  of  two  Mexican  tankers  in 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico  by  German  submarines  provoked  Avila 
Camacho  to  declare  war  on  the  Axis  powers  in  May  1942.  In 
response  to  the  Mexican  government's  expressed  desire  to 
fight  the  Japanese,  a  Mexican  air  squadron  was  readied  for  duty 
in  the  Pacific  theater.  After  a  year's  training  in  the  United 
States,  Squadron  201  of  the  Mexican  Expeditionary  Air  Force 
arrived  in  the  Philippines  in  April  1945.  Flying  P-47  Thunder- 
bolt fighters,  the  Mexican  pilots  participated  in  bombing  and 
strafing  runs  to  support  ground  forces  and  in  long-range 
reconnaissance  missions  over  Taiwan.  Of  thirty-two  pilots  in  the 
expeditionary  squadron,  seven  were  killed. 

The  immediate  postwar  years  were  a  peak  period  of  United 
States  influence  on  the  Mexican  armed  forces.  The  Mexican 
military  reorganized,  using  the  United  States  armed  forces  as  a 
model.  The  military  training  program  incorporated  United 
States  army  field  manuals.  United  States  arms  transferred  to 
Mexico  just  after  World  War  II  were  the  country's  last  major 
acquisitions  of  military  hardware  for  a  period  of  three  decades, 
however.  In  the  mid-1970s,  the  government  accepted  the  need 
for  a  larger,  modernized  army  because  of  growing  concerns 
over  potential  threats  to  its  oil  resources.

The  Military  in  Civilian  Politics 

Despite  the  military's  prominent  role  in  the  history  of  the 
country,  the  Mexican  armed  forces  have  steadily  retreated 
from  direct  involvement  in  political  matters  since  the  1940s. 
The  typical  Mexican  officer  is  deliberately  removed  from  politi- 
cal issues,  and  there  has  been  a  decline  in  military  representa- 
tion in  government  offices  outside  the  armed  services.  Since 
World  War  II,  the  number  of  persons  with  military  back- 
grounds serving  in  the  cabinet,  subcabinet,  state  governor- 
ships, and  in  the  bureaucracy  has  steadily  declined. 

Mexican  political  observer  Adolfo  Aguilar  Zinser  believes 
there  is  little  reason  to  expect  the  officer  corps  to  change  its 
deeply  rooted  loyalty  to  civil  authority.  Serious  domestic  tur- 
moil might  cause  a  conservative  middle  class  and  business 
interests  to  pressure  the  army  to  intervene  in  the  government. 
As  long  as  the  military  remains  assured  of  the  civilian  leader- 
ship's ability  to  deal  with  any  crisis  threatening  the  established 
system,  however,  the  military  is  unlikely  to  be  drawn  into  politi- 
cal affairs. 

National  Security  Concerns 

Under  the  constitution  of  1917,  the  armed  forces  have 
responsibility  for  defending  the  sovereignty  and  independence 
of  the  nation,  maintaining  the  constitution  and  its  laws,  and 
preserving  internal  order.  At  various  times  during  the  first  cen- 
tury of  independence,  Mexico  was  subjected  to  foreign  attacks 
by  the  United  States,  France,  and,  for  a  brief  period,  Spain  and 
Britain.  Mexico's  principal  national  security  concerns  since 
1910  have  been  to  preserve  domestic  political  stability  and  to 
prevent  foreign  economic  domination.  The  last  time  Mexico 
faced  a  foreign  threat  was  when  it  joined  the  war  against  the 
Axis  in  World  War  II.  During  World  War  II  and  in  the  subse- 
quent years  of  the  Cold  War,  however,  Mexico's  proximity  to 
the  United  States  allowed  it  to  fall  under  the  protective  shield 
of  its  northern  neighbor. 

Bilateral  relations  with  the  United  States  have  been  strongly 
affected  by  the  bitter  legacy  left  by  Mexico's  loss  of  more  than 
one-half  of  its  territory  in  1848  and  subsequent  incidents  of 
United  States  infringement  of  its  sovereignty.  General  Winfield 
Scott's  1847  siege  of  the  capital,  the  United  States  marines' 
1-914  occupation  of  Veracruz,  and  General  Pershing's  1916 
punitive  expedition  in  northern  Mexico  against  Pancho  Villa

National  Security 


were  traumatic  episodes  in  Mexican  history.  Even  in  the  post- 
World  War  II  era,  most  Mexicans  viewed  United  States  domina- 
tion, not  Soviet-Cuban  designs  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  or 
revolutionary  regimes  in  Central  America,  as  the  major  foreign 
threat  to  national  sovereignty.  Although  fears  of  armed  inter- 
vention by  the  United  States  have  receded,  concerns  over 
United  States  economic  and  political  penetration  persist. 

The  Mexican  military  is  primarily  organized  to  meet  chal- 
lenges to  internal  order  and  the  existing  polidcal  system.  Since 
the  1940s,  Mexico  has  remained  remarkably  free  from  domes- 
tic upheaval,  perhaps  more  so  than  any  other  Latin  American 
nation.  For  the  most  part,  the  military  has  been  reluctant  to 
become  involved  in  law  enforcement.  The  armed  forces  have 
given  the  responsibility  of  preventing  violence  to  federal  and 
state  police  authorities  except  when  faced  with  a  large-scale 
breakdown  of  civil  order.  Troops  are  not  fully  equipped  or 
trained  to  deal  directly  with  protesters,  and,  with  its  reputation 
at  risk,  the  military  leadership  seems  inclined  to  register  its 
influence  more  as  a  presence  than  an  active  force. 

In  1968  the  military  was  called  upon  to  put  down  massive 
student-led  protests  associated  with  strongly  felt  economic 
grievances.  Fearful  of  losing  control  of  the  situation,  the  army 
violently  suppressed  the  movement  by  opening  fire  on  thou- 
sands of  demonstrators  at  Tlatelolco,  in  northern  Mexico  City. 
The  brutality  of  the  action,  in  which  hundreds  of  demonstra- 
tors were  killed  or  wounded,  was  severely  criticized  and  had  a 
lasting  effect  on  the  public's  perception  of  the  military. 

The  January  1994  uprising  in  the  state  of  Chiapas  by  a  previ- 
ously unknown  guerrilla  group,  the  Zapatista  National  Libera- 
tion Army  (Ejercito  Zapatista  de  Liberacion  Nacional — EZLN), 
has  been  the  only  outbreak  in  recent  years  that  has  necessitated 
major  troop  deployments  (see  Public  Order  and  Internal  Secu- 
rity, this  ch.).  Both  army  and  air  force  units  were  shifted  to  the 
scene  to  drive  the  insurgents  out  of  towns  they  occupied.  After 
widespread  skirmishes  in  which  several  hundred  persons  were 
reportedly  killed,  the  army  was  able  to  regain  control  of  most 
towns  in  the  area  within  a  matter  of  hours,  forcing  the  guerril- 
las to  retreat  into  remote  mountain  strongholds.  Except  for  a 
brief  army  offensive  in  February  1995,  several  consecutive 
cease-fires  prevented  any  further  fighting  after  the  initial 
actions  of  1994.  By  early  1996,  the  military  situadon  in  Chiapas 
was  stalemated:  the  army  occupied  the  towns,  and  the  rebels 
were  largely  confined  to  the  thinly  populated  highlands.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

In  dealing  with  potential  regional  hostilities,  the  Mexican 
military  has  adopted  a  reserved  posture  that  reflects  the  coun- 
try's foreign  policy  traditions.  Neither  Cuban-style  communism 
nor  the  possibility  of  conflict  spreading  northward  from  Cen- 
tral America  has  been  regarded  as  directly  threatening  to 
Mexico.  No  effort  has  been  made  to  erect  defenses  along  the 
3,200-kilometer  land  border  Mexico  shares  with  the  United 
States.  Mexico's  970-kilometer  border  with  Guatemala  also 
remains  unguarded  despite  occasional  clashes  between  Mexi- 
can and  Guatemalan  forces.  When  Guatemalan  army  units  car- 
ried out  raids  in  the  early  1980s  against  Guatemalan  refugees 
and  Mexican  communities  that  were  aiding  them,  the  Mexican 
military  reacted  mildly  to  avoid  confrontation.  Mexican  coastal 
areas  and  its  320-kilometer  Exclusive  Economic  Zone  (EEZ) 
are  lightly  patrolled  by  Mexican  fleet  units.  The  security  of 
Mexico's  coasts  is  effectively  guaranteed  since  they  are  within 
the  orbit  of  United  States  hemispheric  defense. 

Tasks  and  Missions 

In  the  half-century  following  World  War  II,  the  Mexican 
armed  forces  have  never  been  called  upon  to  exercise  an  exter- 
nal defense  role.  Their  primary  mission  has  been  to  deter  and 
prevent  violence  threatening  public  order,  including  outbreaks 
arising  from  strikes  and  protests,  rural  political  grievances, 
guerrilla  insurgency,  and  urban  terrorism.  Since  the  1920s,  the 
military  has  devoted  a  considerable  share  of  its  resources  to 
civic-action  programs  to  improve  socioeconomic  conditions 
and  relieve  human  distress,  particularly  in  rural  areas  that 
otherwise  have  little  contact  with  government  representatives 
(see  Civic  Action,  this  ch.).  The  army  has  often  been  called 
upon  to  respond  to  natural  disasters,  its  responsibilities  set 
forth  in  a  plan  known  as  National  Defense  III  (Defensa  Nacio- 
nal  III — DN  III) ,  and  to  coordinate  the  work  of  other  agencies 
during  the  course  of  the  emergency.  The  army  took  charge  of 
relief  operations  after  the  volcanic  eruption  in  Chiapas  in 
1982.  When  parts  of  the  capital  were  devastated  by  the  power- 
ful earthquake  of  1985,  however,  the  army  played  a  lesser  role 
because  the  civil  authorities  did  not  wish  to  appear  incapable 
of  dealing  with  the  crisis  without  military  help. 

The  army  assigns  large  numbers  of  personnel  to  the  antinar- 
cotics  campaign,  carrying  out  crop  eradication  as  well  as  sup- 
porting law  enforcement  agencies  in  interdiction  missions.  The 
navy  is  responsible  for  maritime  drug  interdiction,  and  the 


292 


National  Security 


ground-based  radar  system  of  the  air  force  supports  air  inter- 
diction efforts  (see  Narcotics  Trafficking,  this  ch.). 

Under  the  Mexican  code  for  federal  elections,  the  army  has 
a  limited  but  important  part  in  the  administration  of  elections, 
monitoring  polling  stations  and  protecting  ballot  boxes  on 
election  day.  Although  the  military  has  generally  remained 
impartial  in  carrying  out  its  election  duties,  it  faced  accusations 
in  1985  and  1986  that  it  assisted  in  manipulating  ballot  counts 
in  the  northern  states  to  ensure  victories  by  the  government 
party,  the  Institutional  Revolutionary  Party  (Partido  Revolucio- 
nario  Insdtucional — PRI). 

As  part  of  its  domestic  security  functions,  the  army  is  also 
responsible  for  protecting  strategic  economic  installations  such 
as  electric  power  plants,  oil  fields,  petroleum  complexes,  ports, 
and  airports.  All  regions  where  the  country's  petroleum 
reserves  are  located  are  regarded  as  of  high  strategic  signifi- 
cance. Petroleum  fields  are  found  primarily  in  the  southeast- 
ern states  of  Veracruz  and  Tabasco  and  offshore  in  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico.  The  threat  of  spreading  conflict  in  Central  America 
and  the  strategic  importance  attached  to  Mexico's  oil  fields 
were  the  decisive  factors  in  the  government's  decision  to  assign 
additional  military  personnel  to  the  southernmost  areas  in  the 
mid-1980s  and  to  relocate  Guatemalans  living  in  refugee  camps 
there  so  as  to  remove  any  pretext  for  Guatemalan  border  incur- 
sions. 

Along  with  protection  of  Mexico's  fisheries  and  detection  of 
vessels  transporting  contraband,  the  Mexican  navy  is  charged 
with  the  defense  of  offshore  oil  installations  and  other  mari- 
time resources.  The  campaign  against  drug  smuggling  has 
placed  an  increasing  burden  on  the  navy's  resources.  These 
heightened  priorities  led  the  government  to  dedicate  a  signifi- 
cantly greater  portion  of  its  budget  to  the  Secretariat  of  the 
Navy  during  the  1980s.  Between  1980  and  1984,  the  United 
States  and  Mexico  were  at  odds  over  the  Mexican  navy's  appre- 
hending of  United  States  fishing  vessels — mainly  tuna  boats — 
within  Mexico's  EEZ.  In  1993  three  smuggling  ships  carrying 
several  hundred  illegal  Chinese  immigrants  were  forced  to 
land  in  Mexico  after  the  ships  had  been  detected  off  the  Cali- 
fornia coast,  adding  another  dimension  to  the  navy's  mission. 

United  States  Concerns 

Mexico  has  enjoyed  peaceful  relations  with  its  northern 
neighbor  for  many  decades.  In  the  United  States,  national 


293 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


security  issues  involving  Mexico  gained  increased  attention 
during  the  1980s  because  of  the  growing  importance  of 
Mexico's  oil  reserves  and  installations  and  because  of  the  fear 
that  leftist-inspired  turbulence  in  Central  America  might 
spread  northward.  Mexico's  economic  difficulties  and  societal 
frictions  intensified  fears  that  the  long  period  of  stable  border 
conditions  might  be  ending.  By  the  early  1990s,  however, 
unrest  had  abated  in  Central  America.  Radical  movements 
were  no  longer  threatening  the  government  of  El  Salvador,  and 
the  leftist  Sandinista  (see  Glossary)  government  was  out  of 
power  in  Nicaragua.  In  Guatemala,  the  civilian  government 
had  largely  overcome  the  left-wing  insurgency  and  had  begun 
to  engage  in  serious  peace  negotiations  under  United  Nations 
auspices.  The  Mexican  military  leadership,  although  conserva- 
tive and  anticommunist  in  outlook,  had  never  been  persuaded 
that  it  faced  a  security  threat  arising  from  the  spread  of  vio- 
lence in  Central  America  or  that  popular  discontent  in  Mexico 
had  gathered  sufficient  force  to  provoke  widespread  domestic 
disorder  and  revolutionary  violence. 

Historically,  relations  between  the  military  establishments  of 
Mexico  and  the  United  States  have  not  been  close.  Coopera- 
tion reached  its  peak  for  a  brief  period  during  and  after  World 
War  II.  In  the  Cold  War  atmosphere  that  followed,  Mexico 
opposed  the  United  States  concepts  of  regional  security;  in  par- 
ticular, it  did  not  support  the  United  States  intervention  in 
Guatemala  in  1954  and  the  trade  embargo  imposed  against 
Castro-led  Cuba  in  the  early  1960s.  The  country's  leaders  felt 
that  the  roots  of  violence  in  Central  America  could  be  found  in 
social  and  economic  problems  and  in  right-wing  dictatorships, 
rather  than  any  Cuban  and  Soviet  subversion.  The  defense 
commission  with  the  United  States  formed  in  World  War  II 
became  inactive,  and  military  assistance — under  which  the 
United  States  transferred  US$40  million  worth  of  modern 
equipment  to  Mexico  in  the  late  1940s — ended  in  1950. 

By  the  late  1980s,  relations  between  the  military  establish- 
ments of  Mexico  and  the  United  States  became  somewhat 
warmer  as  cooperation  expanded  in  the  fight  against  illicit 
drugs.  Purchases  of  United  States  military  items,  which  had 
amounted  to  US$140  million  in  the  five-year  period  1982  to 
1986,  rose  steeply  to  US$410  million  over  the  period  from  1987 
to  1991,  accounting  for  three-quarters  of  all  of  Mexico's  arms 
imports.  Numerous  Mexican  officers  received  training  in  the 
United  States  and  became  well  acquainted  with  United  States 


294

military  doctrine.  On  the  whole,  however,  the  Mexican  armed 
forces  were  less  influenced  by  the  United  States  military  than 
were  the  armed  forces  of  other  countries  of  Latin  America.  In 
the  mid-1990s,  military  assistance  and  concessional  military 
credits  from  the  United  States  to  Mexico  still  had  not  been 
resumed.  About  US$500,000  was  allocated  by  the  United  States 
government  for  military  education  and  training  each  year, 
enabling  more  than  900  Mexican  officers  to  attend  United 
States  military  institutions  between  1977  and  1991.  This  figure 
was  exclusive  of  training  funded  by  Mexico  in  connection  with 
weapons  procurements. 

Treaty  Obligations 

Mexico  is  a  signatory  to  the  principal  defense-related  multi- 
lateral treaties  and  agreements  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  but 
has  refrained  from  entering  into  alliances  or  collective  security 
arrangements  that  could  be  viewed  as  inconsistent  with  its  prin- 
ciples of  nonintervention  and  self-determination.  In  early 
1945,  Mexico,  along  with  nineteen  other  nations  of  the  hemi- 
sphere, signed  the  Act  of  Chapultepec.  Under  the  act,  the  first 
hemispheric  defense  agreement,  signatory  nations  agreed  that 
if  any  aggression  across  treaty-established  boundaries  occurred 
or  was  threatened,  a  meeting  would  be  convened  to  determine 
what  steps,  up  to  and  including  the  use  of  armed  force,  should 
be  taken  to  prevent  or  repel  such  aggression. 

Mexico  signed  the  Inter-American  Treaty  of  Reciprocal  Assis- 
tance, also  known  as  the  Rio  Treaty,  in  September  1947.  The 
Rio  Treaty,  which  expanded  the  responsibilities  of  nations 
under  the  Act  of  Chapultepec,  emphasized  the  peaceful  settle- 
ment of  disputes  among  Western  Hemisphere  nations  and  pro- 
vided for  collective  defense  should  any  signatory  be  subject  to 
external  aggression.  Although  the  treaty  was  conceived  as  a 
means  to  protect  the  nations  of  the  hemisphere  from  possible 
communist  aggression,  Mexico  chose  to  interpret  it  as  a  juridi- 
cal association  of  states,  not  as  a  military  alliance.  Each  time 
that  the  treaty  has  been  invoked,  Mexico  has  voted  against  the 
adoption  of  collective  security  measures  (see  Foreign  Rela- 
tions, ch.  4). 

Upon  formation  of  the  Organization  of  American  States 
(OAS)  in  April  1948,  Mexico  actively  opposed  proposals  to  cre- 
ate a  standing  military  force  under  OAS  supervision.  Mexico 
insisted  on  limiting  the  newly  created  OAS  defense  body — now 
known  as  the  Inter-American  Defense  Board — to  serving  in  a 


295 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

consultative  capacity  to  OAS  member  nations.  Subsequent 
amendments  to  the  charter  have  underscored  the  goal  of 
peaceful  resolution  of  disputes  among  member  states. 

Mexico  initially  proposed  and  then  became  a  signatory  to 
the  1967  Treaty  of  Tlatelolco,  which  prohibits  the  introduction 
of  nuclear  weapons  into  Latin  America.  Similarly,  it  is  a  signa- 
tory to  the  1968  Nuclear  Non-Proliferation  Treaty,  which  limits 
the  application  of  nuclear  technology  to  peaceful  purposes. 
Mexico  has  accepted  the  safeguard  agreements  of  the  Interna- 
tional Atomic  Energy  Agency,  which  include  the  accounting 
and  control  of  nuclear  reactor  by-products  that  could  be  used 
to  make  weapons,  but  has  refused  to  permit  on-site  inspections 
of  its  nuclear  facilities. 

Armed  Forces 

Constitutional  and  Legal  Basis 

The  constitution  of  1917  established  the  guiding  principles 
for  the  armed  forces  and  placed  restrictions  on  their  activities. 
Article  89  places  the  military  under  the  control  of  the  presi- 
dent of  the  republic,  who,  as  commander  in  chief,  is  responsi- 
ble for  seeing  that  the  armed  forces  fulfill  their  obligation  to 
guarantee  "internal  order  and  external  defense."  The  restric- 
tion on  peacetime  interference  by  military  authorities  in  civil- 
ian affairs  or  other  activities  not  "directly  connected  with  the 
military  discipline,"  set  forth  by  Article  129,  has  often  been 
abused,  however,  usually  on  the  order  of  the  president.  The 
final  constitutional  provision  for  establishing  government  con- 
trol of  the  armed  forces,  Article  132,  places  all  military  facilities 
and  properties  under  federal  jurisdiction. 

A  series  of  laws  enacted  in  1926  further  shaped  the  armed 
forces.  The  most  important  of  these,  the  Organic  Law,  gave 
them  a  threefold  mission:  "to  defend  the  integrity  and  inde- 
pendence of  the  nation,  to  maintain  the  constitution,  and  to 
preserve  internal  order."  The  basic  law  subsequently  has  been 
modified  to  keep  pace  with  political,  economic,  and  social 
changes  in  the  Mexican  state. 

Three  additional  laws  enacted  in  1926  also  sought  to  regular- 
ize military  practices.  The  Law  of  Promotions  and  Compensa- 
tion established  a  pay  scale  for  each  rank  and  competitive 
examinations  for  promotion.  The  Law  of  Military  Discipline 
further  defined  the  obligations  of  the  armed  forces  to  society, 
requiring  that  each  soldier,  "in  fulfillment  of  his  duties,  sacri- 


296

fixe  all  personal  interests  to  the  sovereignty  of  the  nation,  to 
loyalty  toward  its  institutions,  and  to  the  honor  of  the  National 
Army."  The  Law  of  Pensions  and  Retirements  set  a  mandatory 
retirement  age  and  provided  pensions  for  military  retirees  and 
allowances  for  military  dependents.  Although  all  of  these  laws 
have  been  modified  to  meet  the  needs  of  changing  times,  they 
remain  the  institutional  foundation  of  the  Mexican  military. 

Organization  of  National  Defense 

The  organization  of  the  Mexican  armed  forces  at  the  cabinet 
level  is  distinct  from  that  of  many  other  Latin  American 
nations.  Instead  of  a  single  ministry  consolidating  the  com- 
mand of  the  army,  navy,  and  air  force,  two  government  minis- 
tries are  directly  responsible  for  national  defense:  the 
Secretariat  of  Nadonal  Defense  and  the  Secretariat  of  the  Navy. 
The  head  of  each  of  these  secretariats  is  a  military  officer  who 
holds  cabinet  rank  and  has  regular,  direct  access  to  the  presi- 
dent of  the  republic,  who  is  the  supreme  commander  of  the 
armed  forces. 

After  President  Carlos  Salinas  de  Gortari  took  office  in  1988, 
five  cabinet-level  councils  were  created  within  the  offices  of  the 


297 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

president  to  oversee  principal  policy  areas.  One  of  these  is  the 
National  Security  Council,  which  includes  representatives  of 
the  secretariats  of  government,  foreign  relations,  national 
defense,  and  the  navy,  as  well  as  the  attorney  general's  office. 
Narcotics  control  is  one  of  the  topics  dealt  with  in  the  council. 

The  secretary  of  national  defense  (General  Enrique  Cer- 
vantes Aguirre  as  of  1996)  is  selected  by  the  president  from  the 
ranks  of  active  army  general  officers.  The  secretary  normally 
serves  for  six  years,  the  same  term  as  the  president's.  Similarly, 
the  secretary  of  the  navy  (Admiral  Jose  Ramon  Lorenzo  Franco 
in  1996)  is  chosen  from  the  ranks  of  active  admirals.  Operating 
through  the  General  Staff,  the  secretary  of  national  defense 
commands  army  and  air  force  units,  the  army  zonal  com- 
mands, and  logistics  and  administrative  directorates.  Under  the 
secretary  of  the  navy  are  the  chief  of  naval  operations,  the  chief 
of  naval  staff,  and  the  naval  zones  that  control  operational 
forces. 

The  army  is  by  far  the  largest  service  branch.  Of  some 
175,000  active  armed  forces  personnel  in  1996,  130,000  were  in 
the  army,  8,000  in  the  air  force,  and  37,000  in  the  navy.  The 
army  total  at  any  one  time  included  about  60,000  conscripts. 
No  conscripts  were  assigned  to  the  air  force  or  navy.  A  "reserve" 
force  of  300,000  is  claimed,  although  this  number  is  a  man- 
power pool  rather  than  an  existing  trained  force. 

The  size  of  the  armed  forces  is  modest  considering  Mexico's 
size  and  importance.  Mexico  has  the  smallest  number  of  mili- 
tary personnel  per  capita  of  any  country  of  Latin  America. 
According  to  the  United  States  Arms  Control  and  Disarma- 
ment Agency  (ACDA),  Latin  America  as  a  whole  had  3.5  sol- 
diers per  1,000  population  in  1991.  The  corresponding  figure 
for  Mexico  was  1.9  soldiers  per  1,000  population.  In  spite  of  the 
steady  increase  in  the  armed  forces — they  have  roughly  dou- 
bled in  size  since  the  mid-1970s — the  number  of  soldiers  per 
capita  has  remained  remarkably  steady  because  of  the  parallel 
increase  in  population. 

Army 

The  principal  units  of  the  Mexican  army  are  six  brigades  and 
a  number  of  independent  regiments  and  infantry  battalions. 
The  brigades,  all  based  in  and  around  the  Federal  District 
(encompassing  the  Mexico  City  area),  are  the  only  real  maneu- 
ver elements  in  the  army.  With  their  support  units,  they  are 
believed  to  account  for  40  percent  of  the  country's  ground 


298 


National  Security 


forces.  According  to  The  Military  Balance,  published  by  the 
International  Institute  for  Strategic  Studies  in  London,  the 
army  in  1996  had  seven  brigades:  one  armored,  two  infantry, 
one  motorized  infantry,  one  airborne,  one  combined  military 
police  and  engineer  brigade,  and  the  Presidential  Guard  Bri- 
gade. The  armored  brigade  is  one  of  two  new  brigades  formed 
since  1990  as  part  of  a  reorganization  made  possible  by  an 
increase  in  overall  strength  of  about  25,000  troops.  The  bri- 
gade consists  of  three  armored  and  one  mechanized  infantry 
regiment. 

Each  of  the  two  infantry  brigades  consists  of  three  infantry 
battalions  and  an  artillery  battalion.  The  motorized  infantry 
brigade  is  composed  of  three  motorized  infantry  regiments. 
The  airborne  brigade  consists  of  two  army  and  one  air  force 
battalion.  The  elite  Presidential  Guard  Brigade  reports  directly 
to  the  Office  of  the  President  and  is  responsible  for  providing 
military  security  for  the  president  and  for  visiting  dignitaries. 
The  Presidential  Guard  consists  of  three  infantry  battalions, 
one  special  force  battalion,  and  one  artillery  battalion. 

Distinct  from  the  brigade  formations  are  independent  regi- 
ments and  battalions  assigned  to  zonal  garrisons.  These  inde- 
pendent units  consist  of  one  armored  cavalry  regiment, 
nineteen  motorized  cavalry  regiments,  one  mechanized  infan- 
try regiment,  seven  artillery  regiments,  and  three  artillery  and 
eight  infantry  battalions.  Infantry  battalions,  each  composed  of 
approximately  300  troops,  generally  are  deployed  in  each  zone. 
Certain  zones  also  are  assigned  an  additional  motorized  cavalry 
regiment  or  one  of  the  seven  artillery  regiments.  Smaller 
detachments  often  are  detailed  to  patrol  more  inaccessible 
areas  of  the  countryside,  helping  to  maintain  order  and  resolve 
disputes. 

The  cavalry  historically  has  been  the  most  prestigious 
branch  of  the  army;  in  1920,  there  were  more  cavalry  squad- 
rons than  infantry  companies.  By  the  early  1980s,  all  mounted 
cavalry  had  been  transformed  into  motorized  units — except 
for  one  squadron  retained  for  ceremonial  purposes.  The  engi- 
neers, air  defense,  and  combat  support  and  service  units  was 
organized  into  separate  regimental,  battalion,  and  company 
units,  which  are  distributed  among  military  zone  installations. 

Mexico  in  1996  was  divided  into  twelve  military  regions  with 
thirty-nine  military  zones.  Zone  boundaries  usually  correspond 
with  those  of  the  country's  thirty-one  states,  with  the  headquar- 
ters of  the  military  zone  located  in  the  state  capital.  Some 


299 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

states,  including  Veracruz,  Guerrero,  and  Chiapas,  which  have 
been  the  scene  of  disturbances  by  peasant  and  Indian  groups, 
have  more  than  one  military  zone  apiece.  The  Federal  District, 
where  Mexico  City  is  located,  is  the  seat  of  the  First  Military 
Zone  and  also  serves  as  headquarters  of  the  First  Military 
Region. 

Military  zone  commanders  are  appointed  by  the  president, 
usually  on  the  recommendation  of  the  secretary  of  national 
defense.  The  senior  zone  commander  in  a  given  area  also  acts 
as  the  commander  of  the  military  region  in  which  the  zone 
falls.  Zone  commanders  hold  jurisdiction  over  all  units  operat- 
ing in  their  territory,  including  the  Rural  Defense  Force  (see 
Rural  Defense  Force,  this  ch.).  They  occasionally  have  served 
the  federal  authorities  as  a  political  counterweight  to  the 
power  wielded  by  state  governors.  Zone  commanders  provide 
the  secretary  of  national  defense  with  valuable  intelligence 
regarding  social  and  political  conditions  in  rural  areas,  and  tra- 
ditionally have  acted  in  close  coordination  with  the  Secretariat 
of  National  Defense  on  resource  planning  and  deployment 
matters. 

Under  a  modernization  program  initiated  in  the  late  1970s, 
the  army  purchased  a  significant  amount  of  new  equipment,  in 
many  cases  replacing  equipment  that  dated  from  the  World 
War  II  period.  The  army's  inventory  of  armored  vehicles  was 
expanded  and  updated.  The  Panhard  ERC-90  Lynx  six- 
wheeled  reconnaissance  car  and  the  Panhard  VBL  M-ll  light 
armored  car  were  acquired  from  France.  Older  designs,  such 
as  the  German  HWK-11  tracked  armored  personnel  carrier 
(APC),  remained  in  the  inventory  in  1996  (see  table  13, 
Appendix).  Several  domestic  versions,  the  DN-3  and  DN-5 
Caballo  and  the  Mex-1,  have  been  added  since  the  mid-1980s. 
The  M4  Sherman  medium  tank  and  several  models  of  light 
tank  transferred  by  the  United  States  after  World  War  II  were 
retired,  leaving  Mexico  without  any  tanks  in  its  inventory.  Plans 
for  a  major  expansion  of  the  country's  own  armament  industry, 
which  might  have  included  a  domestic  tank  design,  were  cur- 
tailed as  a  result  of  the  debt  crisis  of  1982  (see  Domestic 
Defense  Production,  this  ch.). 

Except  for  five  self-propelled  75mm  howitzers,  in  1996  the 
army's  artillery  consisted  mainly  of  towed  105mm  howitzers. 
The  army's  principal  antitank  weapons  are  French  Milan  mis- 
siles, some  of  which  are  mounted  on  the  VBL  M-lls.  Antiair- 
craft weapons  systems  are  limited  to  12.7mm  air  defense  guns.

The  army  has  no  units  equipped  with  tactical  air  defense  mis- 
siles. 

Air  Force 

The  Mexican  armed  forces  saw  the  value  of  air  power  early. 
In  1911  the  Madero  revolutionaries  flew  an  airplane  on  a 
bombing  mission  using  grenades,  and  a  year  later,  after 
Madero  became  president,  three  military  pilots  were  sent  to 
the  United  States  for  training.  Shortly  thereafter,  one  of  the 
rebel  groups  acquired  several  airplanes,  which,  flown  by  for- 
eign mercenary  pilots,  supported  their  ground  forces  during 
the  advance  southward  in  1914.  Unable  to  obtain  additional 
aircraft  because  of  the  war  in  Europe,  the  Carranza  govern- 
ment successfully  developed  and  produced  a  biplane  trainer 
and  subsequently  a  series  of  other  models  from  both  local 
designs  and  from  modifications  of  foreign  planes. 

During  the  1920s,  the  army  bought  various  war-surplus 
bomber,  reconnaissance,  fighter,  and  training  aircraft  at  low 
cost,  although  the  local  aircraft  industry  continued  to  produce 
its  own  models.  In  1932  an  air  regiment  was  formed,  consisting 
of  one  squadron  each  of  Vought  Corsair,  Douglas,  and  Bristol 


301 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

fighters.  After  the  United  States  and  Mexico  entered  World 
War  II,  the  United  States  transferred  a  considerable  number  of 
primary  and  advanced  trainers  to  Mexico,  followed  by  light 
bombers  and  amphibious  reconnaissance  planes  that  were 
used  to  conduct  antisubmarine  patrols  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico. 
The  Mexican  air  force  received  additional  trainers,  bombers, 
and  transport  aircraft  after  the  signing  of  the  1947  Rio  Treaty. 
It  acquired  jet  fighters  from  Canada  and  armed  jet  trainers 
from  the  United  States  in  the  late  1950s. 

The  air  force,  organized  into  two  wings  and  ten  air  groups, 
had  a  personnel  complement  of  8,000  in  1996,  including  1,500 
assigned  to  the  airborne  brigade.  The  air  force's  principal  air 
base,  Military  Air  Base  Number  1,  is  located  at  Santa  Lucia  in 
the  state  of  Mexico.  Other  major  air  bases  are  located  at  Ixte- 
pec  in  Oaxaca,  Isla  Cozumel  in  Quintana  Roo,  Zapopan  in 
Veracruz,  and  Merida  in  Yucatan,  as  well  as  El  Cipres  and  La 
Paz  (both  in  Baja  California  Sur)  and  Puebla  and  Pie  de  la 
Cuesta  (both  in  Guerrero). 

Delivery,  beginning  in  1982,  of  ten  F-5E  Tiger  II  fighter  air- 
craft and  two  F-5F  two-seater  trainers  from  the  United  States 
enabled  Mexico  to  form  a  supersonic  air  defense  squadron 
armed  with  Sidewinder  missiles.  As  part  of  a  construction 
agreement  with  the  United  States,  the  runways  at  the  Santa 
Lucia  air  base  were  lengthened  and  facilities  renovated  to 
accommodate  the  new  planes.  In  1982  the  air  force  also 
acquired  the  first  of  some  seventy  Pilatus  PC-7  turboprop 
planes  from  Switzerland.  In  1996  forty  of  the  PC-7s  were  orga- 
nized into  three  counterinsurgency  squadrons,  and  the 
remainder  are  available  for  both  training  and  counterinsur- 
gency operations.  Also  capable  of  being  armed  for  counterin- 
surgency tasks  is  one  squadron  of  twelve  AT-33s  (Lockheed 
Shooting  Star),  a  much  older  aircraft  used  mainly  as  a  jet 
trainer.  One  squadron  of  Bell  205,  206,  and  212  armed  helicop- 
ters also  is  designated  for  a  counterinsurgency  role.  One  squad- 
ron of  IAI  201s  (the  Israeli  Arava,  a  short-takeoff-and-landing 
utility  transport)  is  assigned  to  search-and-air  rescue,  and  a 
photo  reconnaissance  squadron  is  made  up  of  Rockwell  Com- 
mander 500Ss.  Five  transport  squadrons  are  equipped  with  C- 
47s,  C-118s,  C-130s,  and  some  small  aircraft.  The  Presidential 
Transport  Squadron,  based  at  the  Benito  Juarez  International 
Airport  in  Mexico  City,  has  seven  Boeing  727s  and  one  Boeing 
737,  together  with  smaller  transport  planes  and  a  number  of 
helicopters  (see  table  14,  Appendix).

National  Security 


A  Westinghouse  mobile  radar  system  purchased  in  1988  was 
activated  at  the  close  of  1991  to  track  suspicious  aircraft  in  Gua- 
temalan air  space  flying  toward  the  Mexican  border.  The  sys- 
tem was  introduced  both  as  a  security  measure  to  survey  air 
activity  along  the  Guatemalan  border  and  to  track  planes  smug- 
gling narcotics  from  South  America. 

In  early  1996,  the  air  force  acquired  twenty-nine  UH-1H 
"Huey"  and  eighteen  Bell  206  helicopters  from  the  Federal 
Judicial  Police  for  use  in  military-assisted  counternarcotics 
operations.  In  a  sign  of  the  growing  militarization  of  Mexico's 
drug  war  under  the  administration  of  President  Ernesto 
Zedillo  Ponce  de  Leon,  in  May  1996,  negotiations  were  under- 
way for  the  permanent  transfer  of  an  additional  seventy-three 
surplus  "Hueys"  from  the  United  States  to  the  Mexican  air 
force. 

Rural  Defense  Force 

The  Rural  Defense  Force  (Guardia  Rural),  composed 
entirely  of  volunteers,  augments  the  military  presence  in  the 
countryside.  The  corps  was  formally  organized  under  army 
jurisdiction  according  to  the  Organic  Law  of  1926.  Its  origins, 
however,  date  back  to  the  period  when  the  revolutionary  agrar- 
ian reform  program  was  first  implemented  in  1915.  In  efforts 
to  protect  themselves  against  the  private  armies  of  recalcitrant 
large  landowners,  rural  peasants  organized  themselves  into 
small  defense  units  and  were  provided  weapons  by  the  revolu- 
tionary government.  Until  1955  enlistment  in  the  Rural 
Defense  Force  was  restricted  to  peasants  working  on  collective 
farms  or  ejidos  (see  Glossary).  After  1955  participation  in  the 
Rural  Defense  Force  was  expanded  to  include  small  farmers 
and  laborers.  All  defense  units,  however,  were  attached  to  eji- 
dos, possibly  as  a  means  to  guarantee  control. 

The  Rural  Defense  Force  numbered  some  120,000  in  1970, 
but  was  being  phased  out  in  the  1990s.  The  Military  Balance 
listed  the  corps  as  having  only  14,000  members  in  1996.  The 
volunteers,  aged  eighteen  to  fifty,  enlist  for  a  three-year  period. 
Members  do  not  wear  uniforms  or  receive  pay  for  their  service 
but  are  eligible  for  limited  benefits.  They  are  armed  with  out- 
moded rifles,  which  may  be  the  chief  inducement  to  enlist. 
Rudimentary  training  is  provided  by  troops  assigned  to  military 
zone  detachments. 

The  basic  unit  is  the  platoon  (peloton)  of  eleven  members 
under  immediate  control  of  the  ejido.  Use  of  the  unit  outside 


303 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

the  ejidos  is  by  order  of  the  military  zone  commander.  One 
asset  of  the  corps  is  the  capacity  of  its  members  to  gather  intel- 
ligence about  activities  within  the  ejidos  and  in  remote  rural 
areas  seldom  patrolled  by  military  zone  detachments.  Corps 
members  also  act  as  guides  for  military  patrols,  participate  in 
civic-action  projects,  and  assist  in  destroying  marijuana  crops 
and  preventing  the  transport  of  narcotics  through  their  areas. 

Civic  Action 

Civic-action  programs  designed  to  improve  socioeconomic 
conditions  and  develop  public  facilities  traditionally  have  been 
an  important  mission  of  the  armed  forces.  As  early  as  1921, 
labor  battalions  created  by  order  of  President  Obregon  were 
employed  in  road  construction,  irrigation  projects,  and  rail- 
road and  telegraph  maintenance.  The  Organic  Law  of  the 
Armed  Forces  directs  the  army  and  the  air  force  to  "aid  the 
civilian  population,  cooperate  with  authorities  in  cases  of  pub- 
lic necessity,  [and]  lend  assistance  in  social  programs."  Pro- 
grams designed  to  meet  these  aims  have  been  given  high 
priority  since  the  1960s. 

By  the  1980s,  civic-action  programs  encompassed  a  wide 
range  of  activities  carried  out  by  military  zone  personnel,  often 
in  coordination  with  government  agencies.  These  programs 
reinforced  the  army's  ties  to  the  country's  rural  inhabitants  and 
promoted  national  development.  The  army  was  placed  in 
charge  of  coordinating  disaster  relief  in  1966  under  Plan  DN 
III.  Military  zone  personnel  assist  the  rural  population  in  liter- 
acy programs,  road  building,  bringing  electricity  to  rural  vil- 
lages, repairing  equipment,  school  restoration,  immunization, 
and  dental  care,  and  in  some  cases  provide  emergency  surgery 
in  military  hospitals.  Military  personnel  also  serve  as  escorts  on 
the  national  railroads,  patrol  federal  highways  on  national  holi- 
days, and  participate  in  campaigns  to  eliminate  livestock  dis- 
ease and  crop  damage  caused  by  insect  infestations. 

Secretariat  of  the  Navy 

Mexico  created  a  modest  navy  after  gaining  independence 
from  Spain  in  1821.  At  the  time  of  the  war  with  the  United 
States  in  1846,  the  fleet  was  still  very  small  and  was  forced  to 
remain  in  port  to  avoid  destruction.  Around  1875  several  large 
gunboats  were  acquired  from  Britain,  and  the  naval  academy 
was  established  at  the  main  Gulf  of  Mexico  coast  base  of  Vera- 
cruz. Although  a  number  of  gunboats  and  cruiser/ transports 


304 


National  Security 


were  added  after  the  turn  of  the  century,  the  navy  played  only  a 
limited  role  in  the  Mexican  Revolution.  After  World  War  I  and 
again  after  World  War  II,  the  navy  expanded  by  purchasing  sur- 
plus gunboats,  frigates,  and  corvettes  from  the  United  States 
and  Canada. 

To  meet  its  broadened  responsibilities,  the  navy  has  more 
than  doubled  in  size  since  the  mid-1970s.  According  to  Jane's 
Fighting  Ships,  the  navy's  active-duty  personnel  numbered 
37,000  in  1996.  Of  these,  some  1,100  were  assigned  to  naval  avi- 
ation, and  another  8,600  were  marines.  Also  falling  under  the 
command  of  the  navy  are  members  of  the  coast  guard  and  mer- 
chant marine,  who  support  the  country's  growing  maritime 
fleet. 

The  navy  is  entirely  a  volunteer  force.  Its  personnel  are  dis- 
persed among  various  naval  zones  and  port  installations.  As 
with  the  secretary  of  national  defense,  being  appointed  the  sec- 
retary of  the  navy  requires  not  only  a  distinguished  service 
record  but  also  a  personal  relationship  with  the  president. 
Although  the  general  headquarters  of  the  Secretariat  of  the 
Navy  is  in  Mexico  City,  naval  command  is  divided  between  the 
country's  two  coasts.  The  commanding  headquarters  of  the 
Pacific  fleet  is  at  Acapulco;  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  coast  command 
is  at  Veracruz.  Both  commands  are  organized  into  three  naval 
regions  each.  There  are  seventeen  naval  zones,  one  for  each 
coastal  state.  Some  of  the  naval  zones  are  further  subdivided 
into  sectors.  Through  coordination  within  each  coast  com- 
mand, patrol  operations  are  carried  out  by  the  respective  naval 
zones  along  the  country's  approximately  9,300  kilometers  of 
coastline  and  the  nearly  3  million  square  kilometers  of  ocean 
that  make  up  Mexico's  territorial  waters  and  EEZ. 

The  navy's  primary  mission  is  to  protect  strategic  installa- 
tions and  natural  resources.  This  assignment  translates  into 
safeguarding  the  country's  strategic  oil  installations  (both  at 
port  facilities  and  offshore),  apprehending  foreign  vessels  that 
are  fishing  within  Mexico's  EEZ  without  proper  permits,  and 
interdicting  shipments  of  drugs,  weapons,  and  other  contra- 
band. Although  foreign  fishing  poachers  have  been  a  persis- 
tent problem  for  the  navy,  expanded  efforts  to  conduct 
maritime  surveillance  and  intercept  narcotics  traffickers 
absorb  a  growing  amount  of  naval  resources.  Naval  personnel 
also  participate  in  disaster  relief  efforts  and  in  clean-ups  to  pre- 
vent environmental  damage  from  spills  of  oil  and  other  toxic 
substances.  The  Secretariat  of  the  Navy  supervises  the  dredging 


305 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


of  port  facilities,  the  repair  and  maintenance  of  vessels 
assigned  to  the  fleet  and  to  the  maritime  industry,  the  conduct 
of  oceanographic  research,  and  the  preparation  of  nautical 
charts. 

During  the  1980s,  the  navy  benefited  substantially  from  the 
acquisition  of  new  vessels  and  other  equipment.  Considerable 
funds  also  were  used  for  construction  of  new  ports,  renovation 
of  existing  facilities,  and  development  of  shipyards  and  dry- 
docks  for  repairs  and  maintenance.  Many  of  the  navy's  combat 
vessels  are  World  War  II  ships  originally  part  of  the  United 
States  Navy,  which  have  been  modernized  by  the  addition  of 
new  weapons,  electronic  warfare  and  communications  gear, 
and  the  replacement  of  propulsion  systems. 

Purchases  during  the  1980s  included  two  World-War-II  vin- 
tage Gearing-class  destroyers,  which  joined  a  Fletcher-class 
destroyer  transferred  from  the  United  States  Navy  in  1970.  The 
Gearing-class  vessels  are  armed  with  127mm  (5-inch)  guns  and 
Bofors  40mm  guns  for  air  defense.  They  also  are  mounted  with 
antisubmarine  rocket  (Asroc)  homing  missiles  (see  table  15, 
Appendix).  In  1982  and  1983,  Mexico  acquired  from  Spain  six 
new  Halcon-class  large  patrol  vessels.  The  new  ships  are 
equipped  with  platforms  and  hangars  for  German  Bo-105  heli- 
copters and  are  designed  primarily  to  patrol  the  EEZ.  The  navy 
commissioned  four  Holzinger-class  fisheries-protection  vessels 
constructed  at  Tampico  between  1991  and  1993.  Sixteen  Auk- 
class  patrol  boats  built  in  the  United  States  during  World  War  II 
are  reaching  the  end  of  their  useful  service  life.  All  twelve 
Admirable-class  patrol  boats  were  modernized  in  1994.  Thirty- 
one  Azteca-class  twenty-one-meter  inshore  patrol  boats  are 
used  for  fishery  patrols.  The  first  twenty-one  of  these  were  built 
in  Britain  and  the  remainder  in  Mexico;  Mexico  modernized 
the  British-built  vessels  in  1987.  The  Mexican  fleet  also 
includes  small  patrol  craft,  a  number  of  river  patrol  vessels,  and 
survey  ships  and  logistic  support  vessels.  Naval  cadets  man  the 
Spanish-built  sail  training  ship,  the  Cuauhtemoc. 

Despite  improvements,  the  Mexican  navy  in  1996  was  not  as 
well  equipped  to  protect  its  territorial  waters  and  coasts  as  were 
the  navies  of  other  large  Latin  American  countries.  The  navy 
lacks  submarines  and  missile-armed,  fast-attack  craft.  In  addi- 
tion, Mexico's  larger  vessels  are  without  modern  surface-to-air 
missiles  for  air  defense. 

The  naval  aviation  arm  has  as  its  primary  missions  coastal 
surveillance  and  search-and-air  rescue  operations.  Maritime 


306 


National  Security 


reconnaissance  is  performed  by  Bo-105  helicopters  armed 
with  machine  guns  and  rockets,  most  of  which  operate  off  ship 
platforms.  In  1994  the  naval  aviation  arm  purchased  four 
MD500s,  used  for  training  purposes;  four  Fennee;  and  eight 
Russian  Mi-8  helicopters.  In  May  1996,  the  navy  announced  it 
would  purchase  an  additional  twelve  Mi-8s.  Coastal  patrols  and 
air  rescue  are  carried  out  by  six  HU-16  Grumman  Albatross 
aircraft  and  nine  Spanish-built  C-212  Aviocars.  A  variety  of 
small  transport,  utility,  and  liaison  planes  complete  the  naval 
aircraft  inventory. 

The  marine  force  consists  of  a  paratroop  brigade  of  three 
battalions,  a  battalion  attached  to  the  Presidential  Guard  Bri- 
gade, three  battalions  with  headquarters  in  Mexico  City,  Aca- 
pulco,  and  Veracruz,  and  thirty-five  independent  companies 
distributed  among  ports,  bases,  and  zonal  headquarters.  The 
marines  are  responsible  for  port  security  and  protection  of  the 
ten-kilometer  coastal  fringe.  In  addition  to  having  light  arms, 
the  marines  are  equipped  with  eight  105mm  towed  howitzers, 
60mm  and  81mm  mortars,  and  106mm  recoilless  rifles,  as  well 
as  Pegaso  VAP-3550  amphibious  vehicles. 

Defense  Spending 

The  government  sets  the  overall  size  of  the  military  budget, 
but  the  actual  allocation  of  funds  to  various  activities  and  pur- 
chases is  largely  determined  within  the  defense  ministries.  Lit- 
tle information  is  made  available  on  individual  expenditure 
categories. 

Because  of  exchange-rate  variations  and  scarcity  of  data,  it  is 
difficult  to  establish  budgetary  trends  and  annual  expenditures 
on  defense.  According  to  The  Military  Balance,  the  defense  bud- 
get for  1996  was  16.6  billion  new  pesos  (NMex$;  for  value  of 
new  peso — see  Glossary),  equivalent  to  US$3.0  billion.  This  fig- 
ure compared  to  budget  estimates  of  1.577  trillion  pesos 
(US$641  million)  in  1989  and  1.908  trillion  pesos  (US$678  mil- 
lion) in  1990.  No  explanation  was  offered  as  to  why  the  defense 
budget  appears  to  have  more  than  quadrupled  between  1990 
and  1996. 

Data  published  by  the  United  States  Arms  Control  and  Disar- 
mament Agency  (ACDA)  show  higher  levels  of  spending  on 
defense,  which,  according  to  ACDA  figures,  averaged  about 
US$1.5  billion  annually  during  the  decade  1983-93.  The  peak 
levels  of  spending  were  between  1985  and  1987,  when  levels  of 
about  US$2  billion  were  recorded.  As  ACDA  notes,  data  on  mil-

itary  expenditures  are  of  uneven  accuracy  and  completeness. 
In  addition  to  accuracy  problems  caused  by  sharp  variations  in 
exchange  rates,  capital  spending  and  arms  purchases  may  be 
omitted  in  official  data. 

Based  on  data  from  The  Military  Balance,  military  expendi- 
tures were  0.9  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see 
Glossary)  in  1995.  Military  expenditures  amounted  to  US$17 
per  capita  in  that  year,  reversing  a  declining  trend  that  saw  per 
capita  expenditures  drop  from  US$20  in  1985  to  US$13  in 
1991.  The  economic  burden  of  the  Mexican  military  establish- 
ment is  comparable  to  the  average  expenditure  for  Central 
American  countries. 

Domestic  Defense  Production 

Mexico  has  had  a  small  defense  industry  since  before  the 
Revolution.  In  1996  the  defense  industry  consisted  largely  of 
the  production  of  small  arms,  ammunition,  propellants,  and 
uniforms  in  government  factories.  As  part  of  the  moderniza- 
tion program  launched  in  1976,  the  armed  forces  redirected 
their  efforts  toward  attaining  a  degree  of  self-sufficiency.  The 
General  Directorate  of  Military  Industry  drew  up  plans  for  pro- 
duction of  large  military  systems,  in  cooperation  with  foreign 
arms  manufacturers.  The  major  expansion  originally  envisaged 
had  to  be  curtailed,  however,  because  of  the  economic  difficul- 
ties of  the  early  1980s,  and  projects  discussed  with  West  Ger- 
man, Israeli,  and  Brazilian  defense  industries  involving 
coproduction  of  armored  vehicles  were  abandoned.  The  coun- 
try's military  industry  has  never  reached  the  level  of  Brazil  and 
Argentina,  the  other  major  Latin  American  producers  of 
defense-related  materiel. 

Under  a  coproduction  agreement  with  West  Germany,  the 
Mexican  defense  industry  began  mass-producing  the  standard 
infantry  G-3  automatic  rifle  in  the  early  1980s.  At  the  same 
time,  the  state-owned  Diesel  Nacional  truck  factory  began  man- 
ufacturing three-quarter-ton  trucks  for  military  use  as  well  as 
the  DN-3  and  DN-5  armored  car,  derived  from  the  United 
States  Cadillac-Gage  V-150  Commando.  There  were  periodic 
reports  of  negotiations  with  foreign  producers  to  cooperate  in 
the  manufacture  of  light  and  medium  tanks,  but  questions  of 
financing  and  the  availability  of  special  steel  intervened. 

Between  1972  and  1982,  the  government  allocated  consider- 
able funds  to  the  industrial  sector  for  scientific  and  technical 
development  related  to  military  uses.  In  1982  a  telecommuni- 


310 


National  Security 


cations  network  using  telex  equipment  was  built  to  link  mili- 
tary zones  with  the  headquarters  of  the  Secretariat  of  National 
Defense  in  Mexico  City.  The  armed  forces  also  began  develop- 
ing short-range,  three-  to  twelve-kilometer,  surface-to-surface 
missiles,  but  never  reached  the  production  stage. 

Since  the  Revolution,  Mexico  has  had  an  aircraft  industry 
that  produced  a  number  of  military  models — both  original 
designs  and  licensed  manufactures — that  formed  part  of  the 
air  force  inventory  until  the  1960s.  In  an  effort  to  revive  the 
local  aircraft  industry,  Mexico  held  discussions  with  both  Brazil 
and  Israel  to  produce  trainer  and  light  transport  aircraft  under 
license,  but  plans  had  to  be  shelved  for  financial  reasons. 

Mexico's  major  shipyards  at  Tampico  on  the  Gulf  of  Mexico 
and  Salina  Cruz  on  the  Pacific  Ocean  have  been  involved  in 
the  construction  of  patrol  craft  and  auxiliary  vessels.  The  larg- 
est program,  involving  the  manufacture  of  Azteca-class  patrol 
craft,  was  carried  out  under  a  licensed  production  agreement 
with  a  British  firm. 

Personnel 

Recruitment  and  Conscription 

Only  volunteers  serve  in  active  units  of  the  Mexican  armed 
forces.  Most  recruits  are  of  a  poor  or  indigent  background;  for 
them,  induction  into  the  military  is  often  seen  as  a  source  of 
employment  and  as  a  means  of  upward  social  mobility.  Soldiers' 
pay  is  slightly  higher  than  established  minimum  wages,  and 
recruits  can  hold  second  jobs.  Vocational  and  literacy  training 
for  armed  forces  personnel  improves  their  chances  of  employ- 
ment when  their  term  of  enlistment  is  completed. 

The  basic  requisites  for  induction  into  the  armed  forces  are 
Mexican  citizenship  by  birth,  completion  of  primary  schooling, 
and  absence  of  a  criminal  record.  Initial  recruits  are  between 
the  ages  of  eighteen  and  twenty-one.  Enlistment  is  conducted 
at  military  zone  headquarters  and  other  military  installations. 
Accordingly,  most  of  the  recruits  tend  to  originate  in  the  Fed- 
eral District  and  central  states,  where  bases  are  clustered. 
Vacancies  in  local  units  are  often  filled  by  youths  completing 
their  national  military  service. 

Recruits  enlisting  for  their  first  three-year  term  of  service 
receive  basic  training  at  the  local  unit  to  which  they  are 
assigned,  which  usually  is  not  far  from  the  individual's  home. 
During  the  first  term  of  enlistment,  the  emphasis  is  on  develop- 


311 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

ing  basic  military  skills  using  an  on-the-job  training  approach. 
There  is  a  high  retention  rate  for  first-term  recruits,  who  often 
elect  to  enlist  for  another  three  years.  Recruits  usually  com- 
plete subsequent  terms  of  service  away  from  their  districts.  Per- 
sons completing  this  second  term  of  service  can  hope  to  attain 
the  rank  of  sergeant.  An  increasing  number  of  enlisted  person- 
nel serve  until  they  are  eligible  for  retirement,  which  comes 
after  twenty  years.  The  small  noncommissioned  officer  (NCO) 
corps  is  concerned  primarily  with  indoctrinating  and  molding 
new  recruits  and  serving  in  specialist  functions.  With  a  high 
ratio  of  commissioned  officers  to  NCOs,  commissioned  officers 
tend  to  exercise  most  leadership  responsibilities  in  troop  units. 

Applicants  aspiring  to  become  commissioned  officers  apply 
for  admission  to  one  of  the  three  service  academies.  The  oldest 
and  most  prestigious  is  the  army's  Heroic  Military  College.  To 
be  eligible  for  entrance,  an  applicant  must  be  a  male  Mexican 
citizen  by  birth,  unmarried,  and  between  the  ages  of  sixteen 
and  twenty-one.  Most  candidates  are  sixteen  to  eighteen  years 
of  age.  Besides  paying  a  processing  fee,  candidates  are  required 
to  pass  a  series  of  aptitude,  psychological,  and  physical  exami- 
nations. Screening  is  rigorous;  only  top  performers  are 
accepted,  although  those  not  selected  are  permitted  to  retake 
the  examinations  the  following  year.  Each  year  a  few  senior 
NCOs  who  have  shown  leadership  qualities  are  selected  to 
attend  a  special  one-year  course  at  the  Heroic  Military  College 
preparatory  to  commissioning. 

The  need  to  travel  to  Mexico  City  for  the  examinations  and 
the  required  processing  fee  discourage  many  potential  candi- 
dates from  applying  for  admission.  Applicants  from  distant 
areas  must  meet  their  own  travel  and  lodging  costs.  Along  with 
the  fact  that  the  standards  of  education  are  relatively  higher  in 
the  Federal  District,  these  factors  tend  to  ensure  that  a  high 
percentage  of  academy  entrants  are  residents  of  the  capital 
area. 

Most  officers  are  drawn  from  lower-middle-class  and  middle- 
class  families.  Fewer  than  5  percent  are  believed  to  be  from  the 
upper  class.  Approximately  20  percent  of  cadets  come  from 
military  families,  and  many  others  have  some  military  affilia- 
tion through  relatives.  Young  officers  also  tend  to  marry 
women  from  military  families.  In  view  of  the  importance  of 
personal  relationships  within  the  military,  such  ties  often  are 
relevant  factors  in  the  advancement  of  an  officer's  career. 
Because  they  often  come  from  a  lower  social  stratum  than  civil-

ians  holding  positions  of  comparable  importance,  military  pro- 
fessionals do  not  have  the  same  prestige  as  the  officer  class  in 
some  other  Latin  American  countries. 

The  practice  of  women  following  soldiers  on  campaigns  and 
sometimes  fighting  in  battles  is  well  established  in  Mexican  his- 
tory and  legend.  Until  the  1920s,  Mexican  armies  did  not  pro- 
vide regular  commissary  services,  and  soldiers  in  effect 
employed  women,  known  as  soldaderas,  to  buy  or  forage  for 
food  and  other  supplies  and  to  cook  their  meals.  During  the 
Revolution,  women  sometimes  were  directly  involved  in  the 
fighting.  By  the  1930s,  however,  the  soldadera  system  had  been 
banished  from  the  military  as  a  source  of  immorality  and  vice. 

Women  are  permitted  to  enlist  in  the  modern  Mexican  mili- 
tary and  can  enjoy  careers  in  the  armed  forces,  although  they 
are  subject  to  numerous  restrictions.  The  Organic  Law  states 
that  women  have  the  same  rights  and  duties  as  men  in  the 
armed  forces,  but  in  practice  women  are  not  permitted  to  fill 
combat  positions,  nor  are  they  eligible  for  admission  to  the  ser- 
vice academies.  Women  who  enlist  receive  the  same  basic  train- 
ing as  men,  including  courses  on  the  handling  and  knowledge 
of  weapons,  followed  by  training  in  their  assigned  specialties. 


313 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Women  serve  almost  exclusively  in  the  areas  of  administration, 
medical  care,  communications,  and  physical  education.  The 
highest  rank  a  woman  has  achieved  is  that  of  major  general,  by 
a  senior  military  surgeon. 

Obligatory  military  service  for  males  was  introduced  in  1941 
in  response  to  Mexico's  possible  entry  into  World  War  II.  Dur- 
ing January  in  the  year  of  their  eighteenth  birthday,  all  Mexi- 
can men  are  required  to  register  with  the  local  municipal 
government  for  military  service.  Out  of  approximately  1.1  mil- 
lion who  register  each  year,  some  320,000  are  selected  by  lot- 
tery to  begin  training  during  January  of  the  following  year.  The 
military  obligation  is  for  twelve  months,  which  in  practice 
means  no  more  than  one  morning  a  week  of  calisthenics  and 
drilling  (although  some  draftees  are  now  required  to  fulfill  a 
three-month  period  of  full-time  training). 

On  completing  military  service,  conscripts  remain  in  reserve 
status  until  the  age  of  forty.  Completion  of  the  service  require- 
ment is  noted  on  a  Military  Identity  Card  that  bears  the  individ- 
ual's photograph  and  must  be  revalidated  every  two  years.  The 
identity  card  is  required  when  applying  for  a  passport,  driver's 
license,  or  employment.  This  requirement  provides  the  Mexi- 
can government  with  a  useful  means  of  keeping  track  of  its 
adult  male  population. 

Education  and  Training 

One  of  the  key  factors  in  the  development  of  the  profes- 
sional armed  forces  in  Mexico  is  the  military  education  system. 
It  is  designed  to  underscore  the  importance  of  discipline,  con- 
formity to  law,  and  obedience  to  higher  authority.  The  objec- 
tive is  to  instill  in  officers  deference  to  civilian  institutions  and 
to  discourage  any  notion  of  military  interference  with  the  func- 
tioning of  the  state.  Instruction  on  political,  social,  and  eco- 
nomic topics  is  relatively  sketchy  in  school  curricula, 
presumably  to  avoid  heightening  the  officers'  political  con- 
sciousness. This  limited  education  does  not  apply,  however,  to 
the  most  senior  level,  the  National  Defense  College  (Colegio 
de  Defensa  Nacional). 

The  military's  three  service  academies  form  the  first  tier  of 
the  professional  education  system.  The  army's  Heroic  Military 
College,  located  in  a  southern  suburb  of  Mexico  City,  dates 
back  to  the  1830s  and  is  the  most  prestigious  of  the  three.  Air 
force  cadets  attend  the  Heroic  Military  College  for  two  years, 


314 


National  Security 


followed  by  two  years  at  the  Air  College  in  Guadalajara.  The 
Heroic  Naval  Military  School  for  naval  cadets  is  in  Veracruz. 

In  1991  there  were  245  openings  at  the  Heroic  Military  Col- 
lege for  entering  cadets  although  the  excellent  modern  facili- 
ties completed  in  1976  can  accommodate  many  more.  Entrants 
range  from  fifteen  to  nineteen  years  old,  although  most  are  in 
the  sixteen-to-eighteen  age-group.  The  training  is  physically 
demanding  and  rigorous.  Students  are  deliberately  left  with  lit- 
tle free  time.  Cadets  who  complete  the  four  years  of  training 
are  considered  to  have  achieved  the  equivalent  of  a  prepara- 
tory school  education. 

Graduates  of  the  four-year  army  curriculum  attain  the  equiv- 
alent rank  of  second  lieutenant  and  usually  become  platoon  or 
section  commanders,  spending  three  years  with  tactical  units. 
Young  officers  then  may  be  designated  to  attend  any  of  the 
applied  schools  for  advanced  training  in  infantry,  artillery, 
engineering,  support  services,  or  cavalry.  Graduates  of  the  Air 
College  who  select  a  flight  or  ground  support  orientation  in 
their  course  work  receive  the  rank  of  second  lieutenant  as 
pilots,  general  specialists,  or  specialists  in  maintenance  and 
supply.  Cadets  completing  studies  at  the  Heroic  Naval  Military 
School  are  commissioned  as  ensigns  prior  to  service  with  the 
naval  surface  fleet  or  in  naval  aviation  or  the  marine  infantry. 
The  navy  also  maintains  an  aviation  school  at  the  Benito  Juarez 
International  Airport  in  Mexico  City. 

If  favorably  rated,  an  army  officer  may  be  promoted  to  first 
lieutenant  after  two  years  and  remains  at  that  rank  for  a  mini- 
mum of  three  years.  The  officer  can  resign  his  commission 
after  five  years  or,  after  passing  a  competitive  examination  and 
being  favorably  evaluated,  may  be  placed  on  a  promotion  list 
for  second  captain  in  order  of  his  test  score  (see  Uniforms, 
Ranks,  and  Insignia,  this  ch.).  Similar  requirements  must  be 
met  for  advancement  through  the  rank  of  lieutenant  colonel. 
The  minimum  service  time  is  eight  years  to  reach  first  captain, 
eleven  years  to  reach  major,  and  fourteen  years  to  reach  lieu- 
tenant colonel.  The  rate  of  promotion  is  fairly  predictable.  The 
Senate,  which  must  approve  promotions  to  the  rank  of  colonel 
and  above,  generally  resists  advancing  officers  who  have  not 
served  a  normal  time  in  grade. 

First  and  second  captains  who  can  meet  admission  standards 
may  be  admitted  to  the  Superior  War  College  or,  in  the  case  of 
naval  officers,  the  Center  of  Superior  Naval  Studies.  The  Supe- 
rior War  College  offers  a  three-year  program  for  army  officers 


315 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

and  a  two-year  program  for  the  air  force.  The  equivalent  naval 
course  is  three  years.  Course  work  emphasizes  preparation  for 
command  and  staff  positions,  including  the  study  of  adminis- 
tration, strategy  and  tactics,  war  gaming,  and  logistics,  as  well  as 
more  general  subjects,  such  as  military  history,  international 
law,  and  foreign  languages.  On  completion  of  the  course,  offi- 
cers are  considered  to  have  military  training  roughly  compara- 
ble to  that  of  the  United  States  Army  Command  and  General 
Staff  College  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas. 

Conditions  for  acceptance  to  the  Superior  War  College  are 
strict,  as  is  the  course  work.  Only  about  half  of  the  entrants 
complete  the  full  three  years,  and  only  7  percent  of  the  officer 
corps  are  graduates  of  the  college.  Those  completing  the 
course  successfully  receive  the  degree  of  Licenciate  in  Military 
Administration  and  the  title  of  General  Staff  Graduate,  which 
is  used  with  one's  military  rank  and  commands  some  prestige. 
Graduates  also  receive  a  stipend  of  between  10  and  25  percent 
of  their  salary  during  the  remainder  of  their  active  duty. 

The  National  Defense  College,  created  in  1981,  is  consid- 
ered the  culmination  of  professional  military  education. 
Entrance  is  offered  to  a  select  group  of  senior  army  colonels 
and  generals  and  their  counterparts  in  the  air  force  and  navy. 
The  one-year  program  includes  advanced  training  in  national 
security  policy  formulation,  resource  management,  interna- 
tional relations,  and  economics.  Each  officer  is  required  to 
write  a  thesis  involving  field  research  on  a  topic  involving 
national  security,  politics,  or  social  problems.  The  majority  of 
the  professors  at  the  college  are  civilians.  Although  graduation 
from  the  college  does  not  bring  immediate  promotion,  most  of 
the  generals  reaching  the  highest  positions  in  the  military  hier- 
archy are  alumni  of  the  college. 

A  number  of  other  service  institutions,  separate  from  the 
officer  training  schools  and  the  superior  schools,  fall  under  the 
general  categories  of  applications  schools,  specialization 
schools,  and  schools  offering  basic  NCO  training  and  NCO 
technical  courses.  These  institutions  include  the  Military 
School  of  Medicine,  the  Military  School  of  Dentistry,  a  group 
of  schools  of  nursing  and  other  medical  specialties,  military 
schools  of  engineering  and  communications,  the  Military 
Application  School  of  Infantry  and  Artillery,  the  Military  Appli- 
cation School  of  Cavalry,  and  a  one-year  school  of  instruction 
in  leadership  for  second  and  first  sergeants. 


316 


National  Security 


Mexican  officers  also  attend  military  schools  in  other  coun- 
tries of  Latin  America,  as  well  as  in  France,  Britain,  Italy,  and 
Germany.  Although  Mexico  sends  proportionately  fewer  offi- 
cers to  military  schools  in  the  United  States  than  some  Latin 
American  countries,  it  uses  United  States  training  materials, 
and  United  States  military  doctrine  is  influential. 

Pay  and  Benefits 

The  Law  of  Promotions  and  Compensation  and  the  Law  of 
Pensions  and  Retirement  were  promulgated  in  the  1920s  as  a 
means  to  regularize  military  practices,  bring  the  armed  forces 
under  the  control  of  the  central  government,  and  ensure  the 
stability  of  the  electoral  system  created  by  the  revolutionary 
government.  These  laws,  which  have  been  adjusted  periodically 
to  meet  the  changing  requirements  of  the  government  and  the 
armed  forces,  form  the  backbone  of  the  military  pay  and  bene- 
fits system. 

The  three  branches  of  the  armed  forces  provide  uniform 
pay  and  benefits  for  equivalent  rank  and  years  of  service. 
Throughout  the  1950s  and  1960s,  military  compensation  rose 
at  a  faster  rate  than  the  cost  of  living.  This  situation  changed 
during  the  1970s,  as  pay  failed  to  keep  pace  either  with  the  rap- 
idly increasing  inflation  rate  or  with  earning  power  in  the  civil- 
ian sector.  In  spite  of  spiraling  inflation  during  the  1980s,  pay 
raises  helped  most  military  personnel  keep  abreast  or  slightly 
ahead  of  the  rising  cost  of  living.  Officers  of  lieutenant  rank 
and  above  enjoyed  comfortable  incomes.  In  the  early  1990s, 
however,  pay  scales  for  junior  officers  were  described  as  so 
low — about  US$300  a  month — that  moonlighting  was  accepted 
as  necessary  to  maintain  an  adequate  standard  of  living. 

Although  the  government  does  not  disclose  the  allocation  of 
individual  items  within  the  defense  budget,  it  is  estimated  that 
approximately  60  percent  is  dedicated  to  personnel  expenses, 
including  administrative  costs,  salaries,  and  benefits.  Perqui- 
sites, bonuses  granted  for  educational  achievements,  and  sup- 
plemental pay  for  those  serving  in  command  positions — from 
the  commander  of  a  company  to  the  secretary  of  national 
defense — add  considerably  to  officers'  base  salaries.  Both  the 
amount  and  the  availability  of  fringe  benefits  increase  as  offi- 
cers ascend  in  rank.  Additional  pay  is  also  provided  for  hazard- 
ous duty  assignments. 

Pensions  are  extended  on  a  standard  basis  to  all  military  per- 
sonnel upon  completion  of  service  and  to  dependents  or  bene- 


317 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

ficiaries  upon  their  deaths.  This  benefit  has  been  increased  on 
numerous  occasions  to  encourage  older  officers  to  retire  and 
thus  open  positions  for  younger  officers.  The  mandatory  retire- 
ment age  is  between  forty-five  and  sixty-five,  depending  upon 
rank,  but  former  secretaries  of  national  defense  hold  active- 
duty  status  all  their  lives.  Under  a  1983  modification  of  the  Law 
of  Pensions  and  Retirement,  an  officer  completing  thirty  years 
of  service  can  retire  at  100  percent  of  his  or  her  existing  salary 
and  receive  the  same  increases  granted  active-duty  personnel. 
The  minimum  benefit  for  those  with  fewer  years  of  service  is  20 
percent  of  base  pay. 

The  Mexican  Armed  Forces  Social  Security  Institute  (Insti- 
tuto  de  Seguro  Social  para  las  Fuerzas  Armadas  Mexicanas — 
ISSFAM)  and  the  National  Bank  of  the  Army,  Air  Force,  and 
Navy  (Banco  Nacional  del  Ejercito,  Fuerza  Aerea,  y  Armada — 
Banejercito)  also  provide  benefits  to  military  personnel  and 
their  dependents.  Under  the  ISSFAM,  health  care  is  extended 
through  facilities  at  regional  military  hospitals  in  each  military 
zone  and  the  Central  Military  Hospital  in  Mexico  City.  The 
quality  of  medical  care  is  reported  to  be  high,  and  physicians 
are  trained  in  such  sophisticated  specialties  as  microsurgery, 
organ  transplants,  and  cardiovascular  surgery.  Banejercito 
offers  low-interest  credit  and  life  insurance  to  military  person- 
nel and  provides  financing  for  the  construction  of  dependent 
housing  at  the  country's  various  military  installations.  Rent  for 
dependent  housing  is  set  at  6  percent  of  an  individual's 
income.  Other  services  and  benefits  are  also  available  through 
military  zone  installations.  These  services  include  primary  and 
secondary  education  for  dependents,  assistance  with  moving 
expenses  resulting  from  service-related  transfers,  various  social 
services,  and  access  to  shops  similar  to  small  commissaries.  The 
military  also  manages  a  number  of  farms  throughout  the  coun- 
try to  help  produce  its  own  food  supply. 

Uniforms,  Ranks,  and  Insignia 

Mexico  originally  adopted  its  system  of  officer  ranks  from 
the  Spanish  military.  With  some  modifications,  it  has  been 
retained  in  the  modern  armed  forces.  The  highest  rank  within 
the  Secretariat  of  National  Defense  is  the  rough  equivalent  of  a 
general  in  the  United  States  Army.  The  only  officers  with  the 
rank  of  general  are  current  army  officers  and  former  secretar- 
ies of  national  defense.  Generals  are  identified  by  insignia  com- 
posed of  four  silver  stars  and  a  gold  eagle  worn  on  their 


318 


National  Security 


epaulets  (see  fig.  12).  The  next  highest  rank,  open  to  both 
army  and  air  force  personnel,  is  the  equivalent  of  lieutenant 
general.  Although  there  is  no  difference  between  the  Spanish 
name  for  this  rank  and  that  held  by  secretaries  of  national 
defense,  the  officers  are  separately  identified  by  three  stars  and 
an  eagle.  The  rank  equivalents  of  major  general  and  brigadier 
general  are  distinguished,  in  addition  to  the  emblem  of  the 
gold  eagle  on  their  epaulets,  by  two  silver  stars  and  one  silver 
star,  respectively. 

Officers  holding  the  rank  of  colonel  command  certain  bri- 
gades and  cavalry  regiments,  serve  as  chiefs  of  staff  for  military 
zones,  or  manage  staff  directorates.  Colonels  are  identified  by 
three  gold  stars  arranged  in  a  triangle  on  their  epaulets.  The 
equivalents  of  lieutenant  colonels,  a  select  few  of  whom  may 
command  a  battalion  or  cavalry  squadron  but  most  of  whom 
serve  as  instructors  or  administrative  aides,  wear  two  gold  stars. 
Majors  sometimes  serve  as  second-in-command  of  battalions  or 
squadrons,  but  usually  are  assigned  to  personnel  management 
and  training.  They  are  identified  by  a  single  gold  star. 

Other  commissioned  ranks  include  first  captain  and  second 
captain,  both  comparable  to  the  United  States  rank  of  captain. 
First  captains  wear  three  gold  bars  on  the  epaulet;  second  cap- 
tains have  two-and-one-half  gold  bars.  Captains  command  com- 
panies, squadrons,  and  batteries.  Below  these  ranks  are  first 
lieutenants,  with  two  gold  bars,  and  second  lieutenants,  identi- 
fied by  a  single  gold  bar. 

The  rank  insignia  of  commissioned  naval  officers  consist  of 
gold  stripes  above  the  sleeve  cuff,  the  uppermost  stripe  incor- 
porating a  braided  loop.  The  rough  equivalents  of  the  United 
States  Navy's  ranks  of  admiral,  vice  admiral,  and  rear  admiral 
wear  insignia  consisting  of  a  wide  gold  stripe  plus  narrow  and 
looped  stripes.  The  equivalents  of  admiral  and  vice  admiral  are 
consolidated.  The  sleeve  insignia  of  other  officer  ranks  are  sim- 
ilar to  those  of  the  corresponding  ranks  of  the  United  States 
Navy,  except  that  the  upper  stripe  is  looped.  Officers  of  marine 
infantry  units  are  distinguished  by  red  piping  on  their  insignia 
of  rank. 

The  rank  titles  and  rank  insignia  for  enlisted  personnel  in 
the  army  and  air  force  are  the  same  (see  fig.  13).  The  highest 
rank,  sergeant  1st  class  (or  master  sergeant),  is  recognized  by 
green  epaulets  with  three  horizontal  red  bars.  The  next  two 
lowest  ranks,  sergeant  and  private  1st  class  (or  corporal  special- 
ist), are  distinguished  by  two  and  one  horizontal  red  bars, 


319 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study

National  Security 


respectively.  The  soldado  de  prime? a,  corresponding  to  the 
United  States  rank  of  private  in  the  army  and  airman  in  the  air 
force,  has  two  short  vertical  red  bars.  The  lowest  rank  for  each 
service,  basic  private  or  airman  basic  (soldado),  wears  a  plain 
green  epaulet. 

The  rank  insignia  of  enlisted  naval  personnel  are  indicated 
by  white  stripes  above  the  sleeve  cuff.  Enlisted  personnel  in  the 
navy  have  only  three  ranks,  chief  petty  officer,  petty  officer,  and 
seaman.  A  chief  petty  officer  has  three  white  stripes  and  a  petty 
officer  two.  A  seaman  has  a  single  V-shaped  stripe. 

The  army  officer  corps  has  a  blue  dress  uniform  and  a  dark 
field-green  service  uniform.  A  khaki  uniform  is  used  for  hot 
weather.  The  uniforms  worn  by  naval  personnel,  including 
marines,  are  standard  dark  blue  or  white.  The  dress  uniforms 
of  army  enlisted  personnel  are  dark  field-green;  their  branch 
of  service  is  designated  by  a  colored  bar  displayed  on  the  epau- 
let. Infantry  personnel  wear  a  scarlet  red  bar;  cavalry,  hussar 
blue;  artillery,  crimson;  armored,  gray;  and  engineers,  cobalt 
blue.  The  air  force  uniform  was  modified  somewhat  from  that 
of  the  army  in  the  early  1980s.  Air  force  personnel  are  identi- 
fied by  purple  bars.  Members  of  the  elite  airborne  brigade  are 
distinguished  by  their  camouflage  fatigues  and  purple  berets. 
Dress  uniforms  for  enlisted  army  personnel  include  the  use  of 
helmets  as  headgear.  Members  of  the  officer  corps  wear  caps 
with  elaborate  visor  decorations  and  rank  designations. 

Public  Order  and  Internal  Security 

Criminal  activity,  much  of  it  engendered  by  narcotics  traf- 
ficking and  production,  has,  since  the  1970s,  constituted  the 
most  serious  problem  facing  military  and  police  agencies  con- 
cerned with  internal  security.  Mexico's  leaders  are  increasingly 
conscious  of  the  threat  that  drug  cartels,  with  enormous  funds 
and  weapons  at  their  disposal,  pose  to  the  nation's  political  and 
social  stability.  The  illicit  movement  of  drugs  generates  huge 
amounts  of  money  that  can  be  employed  to  corrupt  public  offi- 
cials at  both  the  state  and  federal  levels.  Traffickers  also  can 
assemble  large  weapons  arsenals,  which  contribute  to  the  atmo- 
sphere of  lawlessness  in  society  (see  Narcotics  Trafficking,  this 
ch.). 

Until  the  uprising  in  Chiapas  in  1994,  revolutionary  activity 
amounting  to  insurrection  against  the  state  had  not  been  a 
major  source  of  concern  for  several  decades.  Groups  that 
sprang  up  to  exploit  the  plight  of  the  downtrodden  and  the  dis- 


321 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


322 


National  Security 


parities  between  the  rich  and  poor  have  failed  to  coalesce  into 
a  single  movement  powerful  enough  to  threaten  the  stability  of 
the  central  government.  The  fragmentation  of  the  forces  of 
protest  has  been  ascribed  to  several  factors,  including  the  terri- 
torial expanse  and  geographic  diversity  of  the  country,  the  pre- 
occupation with  local  injustices  suffered  at  the  hands  of  those 
holding  economic  power,  and  the  government's  determination 
to  deal  harshly  with  any  threat  to  public  order. 

During  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s,  several  guerrilla  orga- 
nizations operated  in  the  countryside.  The  three  principal 
groups  were  the  National  Revolutionary  Civic  Association,  the 
Mexican  Proletarian  Party,  and  the  Party  of  the  Poor.  Each  was 
directed  by  a  charismatic  leader,  who  eventually  was  tracked 
down  and  killed  in  confrontations  with  the  military  or  police. 
None  of  the  groups  was  able  to  carry  on  organized  operations 
after  its  leader's  death. 

The  police  claimed  in  1981  that  they  had  destroyed  the  last 
cell  of  the  Twenty-Third  of  September  Communist  League,  the 
largest  and  longest-lived  of  Mexico's  urban  guerrilla  groups. 
The  league  reportedly  had  incorporated  members  from  several 
other  urban  guerrilla  fronts.  Many  terrorist  acts  were  commit- 
ted in  the  name  of  the  league  before  its  eradication,  including 
the  kidnapping  of  two  United  States  consular  officers  in  1973 
and  1974  (one  officer  was  freed  after  a  ransom  was  paid,  and 
the  other  was  murdered) . 

The  Chiapas  Rebellion 

Mexico's  rural  indigenous  peoples  periodically  have  risen  in 
protest  against  poverty  and  encroachment  by  large  farmers, 
ranchers,  and  commercial  interests  on  contested  land.  The 
most  recent  and  serious  such  uprising  occurred  on  January  1, 
1994,  when  the  Zapatista  National  Liberation  Army  (Ejercito 
Zapatista  de  Liberation  Nacional — EZLN)  rebelled,  capturing 
four  municipalities  in  Chiapas  state.  Some  of  the  group, 
believed  to  number  about  1,600,  were  armed  with  semiauto- 
matic and  assault  rifles,  whereas  others  were  armed  only  with 
sticks  and  wooden  bayonets.  Although  the  group's  attacks 
seemed  well  planned,  army  units,  supported  by  air  force 
strikes,  were  able  to  regain  control  after  the  initial  surprise.  At 
least  12,000  troops  were  transported  to  the  scene.  Officials 
announced  that  120  deaths  had  resulted,  although  church  offi- 
cials said  400  lives  had  been  lost.  Five  rebels  apparently  were 
executed  while  bound,  and  other  deaths  may  have  been  the 


323 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

result  of  extrajudicial  executions.  Many  disappearances  of  peas- 
ants were  reported,  and  there  was  indiscriminate  strafing  of 
hamlets.  The  government  declared  a  unilateral  cease-fire  after 
twelve  days  and  announced  several  goodwill  gestures  as  a  pre- 
lude to  reconciliation  talks  with  the  rebels,  who  were  repre- 
sented by  their  masked  leader,  Subcommander  Marcos. 

According  to  government  sources,  the  EZLN,  commonly 
known  as  the  Zapatistas,  is  not  a  purely  indigenous  movement, 
but  is  instead  an  alliance  of  middle-class  intellectuals  and  radi- 
calized indigenous  groups  dating  from  the  early  1980s.  The 
EZLN  began  as  an  offshoot  of  the  National  Liberation  Forces 
(Fuerzas  de  Liberacion  Nacional — FLN),  a  Maoist  guerrilla 
group  that  had  been  largely  dormant  since  the  1970s.  At  the 
start  of  the  Zapatista  rebellion,  command  of  the  Zapatista  army 
was  jointly  held  by  FLN  veterans  from  Mexico  City  and  a  "clan- 
destine committee"  of  Chiapas  Indians  representing  the  vari- 
ous ethnic  groups  residing  in  the  area. 

In  February  1995,  on  the  eve  of  a  new  offensive  against  rebel 
strongholds,  the  government  identified  Subcommander  Mar- 
cos as  Rafael  Sebastian  Guillen,  a  white,  middle-class  graduate 
in  graphics  design  from  the  National  Autonomous  University 
of  Mexico  (Universidad  Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico— 
UNAM).  In  the  initial  January  1994  Zapatista  raids,  the  charis- 
matic guerrilla  leader  had  become  an  international  media  star, 
quickly  assuming  the  status  of  a  folk  hero  among  many  Mexi- 
cans. Capitalizing  on  his  newfound  fame  and  his  proximity  to 
the  rebel  army,  Marcos  is  believed  to  have  wrested  control  of 
the  EZLN  from  its  Mexico  City  leadership. 

Despite  a  formidable  government  offensive  involving 
approximately  20,000  army  troops  venturing  into  Zapatista- 
held  territory,  Subcommander  Marcos  and  his  rebel  force 
eluded  capture.  By  late  February  1995,  a  second  cease-fire  had 
been  declared.  Soon  thereafter,  the  government  and  the  rebels 
embarked  on  a  second  major  round  of  peace  talks.  In  early 
1996,  the  Zapatistas  declared  their  willingness  in  principle  to 
lay  down  their  arms  and  become  a  legal  political  party  pending 
major  reforms  of  the  political  system.  Despite  their  ability  to 
grab  headlines  and  attract  international  support,  the  Zapatistas 
remain  a  marginal  political  force  and  are  not  considered  a  seri- 
ous military  threat  outside  of  Chiapas. 

Police  and  Law  Enforcement  Organizations 

A  number  of  federal,  state,  and  local  police  and  law  enforce- 


324 


National  Security 


ment  organizations  exist  to  provide  for  internal  security.  Their 
responsibilities  and  jurisdictions  frequently  overlap,  a  factor 
acknowledged  in  1984  when  the  government  created  a 
national  consulting  board  designed  to  "coordinate  and  advise 
police  forces"  throughout  the  country.  The  senior  law  enforce- 
ment organization  in  Mexico  is  the  Federal  Judicial  Police, 
which  is  controlled  by  the  attorney  general.  The  plainclothes 
force  acts  as  an  investigative  agency  with  arrest  power  for  the 
Office  of  the  Attorney  General.  The  foremost  activity  of  the 
Federal  Judicial  Police  is  carrying  out  investigations  and  mak- 
ing apprehensions  related  to  drug  trafficking.  Espionage,  arms 
trafficking,  and  bank  robberies  also  fall  under  its  purview.  The 
Federal  Judicial  Police  serves  as  the  government's  liaison  with 
the  International  Criminal  Police  Organization  (Interpol).  Its 
role  can  be  compared  to  a  combination  of  the  United  States 
Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  and  the  United  States 
Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (DEA). 

The  jurisdiction  of  the  Federal  Judicial  Police  encompasses 
the  entire  nation.  For  control  purposes,  its  jurisdiction  is 
divided  into  thirteen  zones  with  fifty-two  smaller  detachment 
headquarters.  Under  the  coordination  of  the  local  federal 
prosecutor,  each  zone  is  headed  by  a  second  commandant  of 
the  Federal  Judicial  Police,  who  in  turn  directs  the  group  chiefs 
in  the  outlying  detachments.  Individuals  arrested  by  the  Fed- 
eral Judicial  Police  are  placed  at  the  disposition  of  the  local 
federal  prosecutor,  who  appoints  subordinate  attorneys  to 
assess  each  case. 

Although  it  remains  one  of  the  smaller  law  enforcement 
agencies,  the  Federal  Judicial  Police  tripled  in  size  between 
1982  and  1984,  from  500  personnel  to  an  estimated  1,500.  In 
1988  an  assistant  attorney  general's  office  for  investigating  and 
combating  drug  trafficking  was  formed  with  an  additional 
1,500  Federal  Judicial  Police  agents.  In  1990  the  office  was 
expanded  and  given  interagency  coordinating  functions  in  the 
battle  against  narcotics. 

The  principal  Mexico  City  police  force,  the  Protection  and 
Transit  Directorate,  also  known  as  the  Traffic  Police,  consists  of 
some  29,000  officers  organized  into  thirty-three  precincts.  It  is 
the  largest  law  enforcement  organization  in  Mexico.  More  than 
100  serious  crimes  are  reported  each  day  in  Mexico  City,  and 
on  average  in  the  Federal  District  in  the  first  quarter  of  1997 
one  police  officer  was  killed  and  one  injured  weekly.  A  sense  of 
insecurity  prevails  among  many  citizens  because  of  the  lack  of 


325 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

confidence  in  the  police  and  the  fear  of  police  misbehavior 
and  crime. 

The  Federal  District  police  are  poorly  paid;  in  1992  they 
earned  between  US$285  and  US$400  a  month.  Double  shifts 
are  common,  although  no  extra  pay  for  overtime  is  provided. 
Incomes  can  be  supplemented  in  various  ways,  including  from 
petty  bribes  (mordidas)  from  motorists  seeking  to  park  in 
restricted  zones.  Police  are  said  to  be  obliged  to  pay  for  more 
desirable  assignments  where  the  possibilities  of  extorting  pay- 
ments from  drivers  in  lieu  of  fines  is  greater.  However,  junior 
officers  are  forced  to  pass  along  a  daily  quota  of  bribes  to  more 
senior  officers.  In  one  case,  a  tow  truck  driver  admitted  that  he 
had  paid  more  than  US$1,000  for  his  lucrative  job  and  said  that 
he  had  to  contribute  US$32  daily  to  his  superior.  In  1992  after 
a  number  of  officers  expressed  their  objections  to  the  system, 
the  mayor  of  Mexico  City  set  up  offices  to  receive  and  investi- 
gate citizen  complaints. 

A  number  of  smaller  law  enforcement  bodies  exist  at  the 
state  and  local  level.  Each  of  the  country's  thirty-one  states  and 
the  Federal  District  has  its  own  judicial  police — the  State  Judi- 
cial Police  and  the  Federal  District  Judicial  Police.  State  police 
are  under  the  direction  of  the  state's  governor;  the  Federal  Dis- 
trict Judicial  Police  fall  under  the  control  of  the  Federal  Dis- 
trict attorney  general.  The  distinction  between  crimes 
investigated  by  State  and  Federal  Judicial  Police  is  not  always 
clear.  Most  offenses  come  under  the  state  authorities.  Drug 
dealing,  crimes  against  the  government,  and  offenses  involving 
several  jurisdictions  are  the  responsibility  of  the  federal  police. 

Cities  and  municipalities  have  their  own  preventive  and 
municipal  police  forces,  which  are  responsible  for  handling 
minor  civil  disturbances  and  traffic  infractions.  The  Federal 
Highway  Police  patrols  federally  designated  highways  and 
investigates  traffic  accidents.  Highway  police  are  assisted  by 
military  personnel  on  national  holidays. 

Both  state  and  municipal  forces  operate  from  precinct  sta- 
tions, called  delegaciones.  Each  delegation  has  an  average  of  200 
police  officers  attached  to  it.  The  ranking  officer  is  known  as  a 
comandante,  equivalent  to  a  first  captain  in  the  military.  Most  of 
the  remaining  personnel  hold  the  ranks  of  first  sergeant,  sec- 
ond sergeant,  and  corporal. 

Immigration  officers,  directed  by  the  Mexican  Immigration 
Service  under  the  Secretariat  of  Government  (Secretaria  de 
Gobernacion),  have  the  right  to  detain  suspected  undocu- 


326 


National  Security 


merited  aliens  and,  under  certain  conditions,  to  deport  them 
without  formal  deportation  proceedings.  Customs  officers, 
controlled  by  the  Secretariat  of  Finance  and  Public  Credit 
(Secretaria  de  Hacienda  y  Credito  Publico),  Credito  are 
deployed  at  borders  and  at  international  airports  to  interdict 
contraband  entering  Mexico.  The  Bank  of  Mexico  also  oper- 
ates its  own  security  division,  which  is  charged  with  enforcing 
banking  and  monetary  laws,  including  cases  of  counterfeiting, 
fraud,  and  money  laundering. 

A  number  of  unofficial  paramilitary  groups  incorporating 
various  police  officials  have  existed  in  the  past  to  deal  with 
rural  and  urban  guerrillas  and  illegal  groups.  The  most  notori- 
ous paramilitary  group  was  the  White  Brigade  (Brigada 
Blanca)  whose  existence  was  officially  denied,  although  it  was 
known  to  be  active  from  1977  until  1980,  when  the  government 
dismantled  it.  The  White  Brigade  consisted  of  a  group  of  offi- 
cers from  the  army  and  the  police  forces  that  used  illegal  tac- 
tics to  destroy  guerrilla  movements.  Published  reports  held 
that  the  White  Brigade  was  responsible  for  the  "disappearance" 
of  several  hundred  leftists,  most  of  whom  the  government 
claimed  were  killed  in  fights  between  rival  leftist  groups.  Politi- 
cally motivated  "disappearances"  tapered  off  sharply  during  the 
1980s,  but  were  once  again  being  reported  in  the  mid-1990s  in 
connection  with  the  unrest  in  Chiapas. 

The  government  has  repeatedly  denounced  abuses  and  cor- 
ruption by  the  Federal  Judicial  Police  and  other  police  forces. 
Numerous  reforms  have  been  announced,  personnel  shifted, 
and  codes  of  procedures  adopted.  Allegations  of  police  brutal- 
ity have  declined,  but  torture,  wrongful  arrests,  and  involve- 
ment in  drug  trafficking  have  not  been  eliminated  because 
abuses  are  so  deeply  rooted  in  the  police  agencies,  and  viola- 
tors for  the  most  part  have  been  able  to  act  with  impunity  (see 
Human  Rights  Concerns,  this  ch.). 

In  1991  Attorney  General  Enrique  Alvarez  del  Castillo,  who 
was  reported  to  have  impeded  several  human  rights  investiga- 
tions against  the  police,  was  abruptly  removed  from  office  and 
replaced  by  Ignacio  Morales  Lechuga.  Morales  quickly 
announced  a  crackdown  on  corruption,  including  a  reorgani- 
zation of  the  Federal  Judicial  Police,  the  creation  of  special 
anticorruption  and  internal  affairs  units,  as  well  as  a  unit  to 
protect  citizens  against  crimes  committed  by  the  police.  In 
addition,  all  federal  police  units  were  placed  under  the  control 
of  a  civilian  deputy  attorney  general.  New  high-level  officials 


327 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


supervised  police  activities  in  sensitive  border  areas.  These 
reform  measures  were  announced  soon  after  a  jailed  drug  lord 
took  over  a  prison  in  Matamoros,  claiming  that  agents  of  the 
Federal  Judicial  Police  aligned  with  another  drug  lord  were 
threatening  his  life. 

Despite  Morales's  reputation  as  an  upright  official  prepared 
to  dismiss  police  agents  and  government  prosecutors  suspected 
of  ties  with  drug  traffickers,  he  was  replaced  in  early  1993. 
Later  reports  accused  some  of  Morales's  subordinates  of  drug- 
related  corruption.  The  new  attorney  general,  Jorge  Carpizo 
MacGregor,  was  a  respected  human  rights  activist.  Carpizo 
acknowledged  in  a  detailed  report  the  close  relations  between 
criminals  and  law  enforcement  agencies  and  produced  his  own 
program  to  eliminate  deficiencies  and  corruption  among  the 
police.  His  reforms  brought  some  progress;  some  members  of 
the  security  forces  were  charged  and  sentenced,  and  human 
rights  violations  declined,  but  the  so-called  "culture  of  impu- 
nity" still  prevailed.  Carpizo  resigned  as  attorney  general  in 
early  1994  and  was  replaced  by  Diego  Valadez. 

The  1994  assassinations  of  PRI  presidential  candidate  Luis 
Donaldo  Colosio  Murrieta  and  PRI  Secretary  General  Jose 
Francisco  Ruiz  Massieu  shook  the  highest  levels  of  federal  law 
enforcement.  After  failing  to  make  significant  progress  in 
investigating  the  Colosio  case,  Attornev  General  Valadez  was 
replaced  in  Mav  1994  by  Humberto  Bemtez  Trevino.  Initially 
declaring  that  the  Colosio  assassination  was  the  work  of  a  lone 
gunman,  the  Attorney  General's  office  later  revised  its  theory 
based  on  videotape  evidence  that  suggested  a  conspiracy  of  up 
to  six  individuals  working  in  concert  to  allow  the  alleged  gun- 
man to  approach  the  candidate  during  a  crowded  campaign 
rally.  The  post  of  attorney  general  underwent  yet  another 
change  in  early  1996  when  incoming  President  Zedillo 
replaced  Bemtez  with  an  opposition  congressman,  Fernando 
Antonio  Lozano  Gracia.  Lozano's  tenure  was  significant 
because  it  was  the  first  time  a  non-PRI  official  held  the  post. 

Late  in  1994,  the  assassination  of  Jose  Francisco  Ruiz  Mas- 
sieu prompted  a  special  investigation  headed  by  Deputy  Attor- 
nev General  Mario  Ruiz  Massieu,  brother  of  the  slain 
politician.  After  calling  dozens  of  PRI  officials  to  testify,  Ruiz 
resigned  abruptly  in  November,  accusing  high-level  PRI  func- 
tionaries of  complicity  in  the  killing  and  of  impeding  further 
progress  in  the  investigation.  In  early  1996,  the  investigation 
still  had  produced  no  results.

Directorate  of  Security,  which  was  under  the  control  of  the  Sec- 
retariat of  Government,  was  the  primary  agency  assigned  to 
preserve  internal  stability  against  subversion  and  terrorist 
threats.  The  directorate  was  responsible  for  investigating 
national  security  matters  and  performed  other  special  duties  as 
directed  by  the  president.  It  acted  as  the  equivalent  of  the 
United  States  DEA  in  the  Mexican  government.  A  plainclothes 
force,  the  directorate  had  no  legal  arrest  powers  nor  formal 
authority  to  gather  evidence,  although  it  could  call  upon  the 
assistance  of  other  government  agencies  and  could  use  other 
surveillance  techniques. 

By  the  final  years  of  its  existence,  the  directorate  had  more 
than  doubled  in  size  to  some  2,000  personnel.  The  agency's 
demise  came  after  it  became  evident  that  many  of  its  personnel 
were  in  league  with  major  drug  traffickers.  Its  successor  was  the 
Center  for  Investigation  and  National  Security  (Centro  de 
Investigacion  y  Seguridad  Nacional — CISN).  Although  for- 
mally under  the  Secretariat  of  Government,  CISN  is  said  to 
operate  under  direct  presidential  control.  Still  primarily  con- 
cerned with  gathering  intelligence,  CISN  also  has  expanded 
activities  to  include  opinion  polling  and  analysis  of  domestic 
political  and  social  conditions.  In  1992  illegal  wiretaps  were 
found  in  a  meeting  room  to  be  used  by  the  central  committee 
of  the  opposition  National  Action  Party  (Partido  de  Accion 
Nacional — PAN).  Although  the  government  denied  any  official 
involvement,  the  local  representative  of  CISN  was  forced  to 
resign. 

Human  Rights  Concerns 

Brutality  and  systematic  abuses  of  human  rights  by  elements 
of  the  Mexican  internal  security  forces  are  pervasive  and  have 
largely  gone  unpunished.  Practices  cited  by  human  rights 
groups  include  the  use  of  torture,  extrajudicial  killings,  disap- 
pearances, arbitrary  detention,  and  other  cruelties  perpetrated 
against  private  persons  and  prisoners.  According  to  several 
sources,  the  number  and  seriousness  of  such  offenses  has 
declined  somewhat  in  the  early  1990s.  The  improvement  has 
been  attributed  to  the  greater  determination  of  the  national 
government  to  prosecute  offenders  and  to  the  work  of  national 
and  local  human  rights  agencies  in  exposing  instances  of 


329 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


police  violations  of  human  rights  and  in  pressing  for  punish- 
ment. 

In  1990  the  Mexican  government  established  the  National 
Human  Rights  Commission  (Comision  Nacional  de  Derechos 
Humanos — CNDH).  Initially  under  the  Secretariat  of  Govern- 
ment, the  CNDH  was  granted  constitutional  status  and  full 
autonomy  under  a  law  enacted  in  1992.  By  the  following  year, 
similar  offices  to  investigate  abuses  had  been  established  in  all 
states  of  Mexico.  The  CNDH  has  the  power  to  compel  officials 
to  grant  access  and  give  evidence.  Its  recommendations  are 
nonbinding  on  government  agencies,  however.  As  of  1993,  268 
of  624  CNDH  recommendations  had  been  followed  fully. 
These  resulted  in  eighty-two  people  being  arrested  and  twenty 
sentenced  to  prison  terms  averaging  more  than  five  years  for 
human  rights  violations. 

According  to  the  private  human  rights  organization, 
Amnesty  International,  state  judicial  police  and  other  law 
enforcement  agencies  frequently  use  torture  in  the  form  of 
beatings,  near-asphyxiation,  electric  shock,  burning  with  ciga- 
rettes, and  psychological  torture.  Most  victims  are  criminal  sus- 
pects, but  others,  such  as  leaders  of  indigenous  groups  or  civil 
rights  activists  engaged  in  demonstrations  or  other  peaceful 
activities,  have  been  targeted  as  well.  According  to  the  CNDH, 
complaints  of  torture  declined  from  446  in  its  first  year  of  oper- 
ation to  141  cases  in  its  fourth. 

New  laws  enacted  in  1991  permit  courts  to  accept  confes- 
sions only  when  made  before  a  judge  or  court  official  in  the 
presence  of  defense  counsel.  Similar  rules  were  adopted  by  sev- 
eral states.  Formerly,  confessions  obtained  under  duress  were 
admitted  as  evidence  in  court.  Some  defendants  have  claimed 
that  even  with  the  change,  they  still  fear  torture  if  they  fail  to 
confess. 

Although  in  the  1990s  fewer  new  cases  of  human  rights  viola- 
tions were  reported  each  year,  numerous  charges  of  extrajudi- 
cial killings  continue  to  be  made  against  the  police.  Police 
linked  to  drug  rings  have  been  accused  of  narcotics-related 
executions.  In  several  well  publicized  instances,  civil-rights 
workers  were  slain,  as  were  peasant  activists  involved  in  disputes 
over  land  titles.  Police  often  assist  local  landowners  in  evicting 
peasant  and  urban  squatters  in  conflicts  over  land  and  in 
employing  violence  without  appropriate  judicial  orders. 

Police  officers  seldom  are  prosecuted  or  dismissed  for 
abuses.  In  1992,  however,  the  attorney  general  removed  sixty- 


330 


National  Security 


seven  Federal  Judicial  Police  agents  and  federal  prosecutors 
and  referred  270  cases  of  alleged  corruption  or  human  rights 
violations  for  prosecution.  Acceptance  of  the  CNDH  has  grown 
steadily,  and  its  investigations  have  resulted  in  a  reduction  of 
reported  police  misconduct,  especially  at  the  federal  level. 

According  to  the  CNDH,  illegal  deprivation  of  liberty  is  the 
most  common  human  rights  complaint  among  its  human 
rights  cases.  Between  1990  and  1992,  there  were  826  allegations 
of  arbitrary  detentions.  Torture  complaints  numbered  446  in 
the  commission's  first  year  but  fell  to  290  during  its  second. 
Nearly  100  nongovernmental  human  rights  monitoring  groups 
also  have  formed,  making  it  increasingly  difficult  for  law 
enforcement  bodies  to  remain  indifferent  to  public  opinion. 
Nevertheless,  the  United  States  Department  of  State,  in  its 
Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights  Practices  for  1995,  reported  a 
continuing  failure  to  try,  convict,  and  sentence  prison  and 
police  officials  guilty  of  abuse. 

Criminal  Justice  System 

The  judiciary  is  divided  into  federal  and  state  systems.  Fed- 
eral courts  have  jurisdiction  over  major  felonies,  including 
drug  trafficking.  In  the  federal  system,  judicial  power  is  exer- 
cised by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Justice,  circuit  courts,  and  dis- 
trict courts  (see  Judicial,  ch.  4).  The  first  chamber  of  the 
Supreme  Court,  composed  of  a  president  and  four  other 
judges,  deals  with  penal  affairs.  Twelve  collegiate  circuit  courts, 
each  with  three  magistrates,  deal  with  the  right  of  amparo  (con- 
stitutional rights  of  an  individual,  similar  to  habeas  corpus). 
Nine  unitary  circuit  courts,  of  one  magistrate  each,  deal  with 
appeals.  There  are  sixty-eight  one-magistrate  district  courts. 
State  judiciary  systems  following  a  similar  pattern  are  com- 
posed of  state  supreme  courts,  courts  of  first  instance,  and  jus- 
tices of  the  peace  or  police  judges. 

In  most  instances,  arrests  can  be  made  only  on  authority  of  a 
judicial  warrant,  with  the  exception  of  suspects  caught  in  the 
act  of  committing  crimes.  Suspects  often  are  arrested  without 
warrants,  but  judges  tend  to  overlook  this  irregularity.  Those 
arrested  are  required  to  be  brought  before  an  officer  of  the 
court  as  soon  as  possible,  generally  within  forty-eight  hours 
(ninety-six  hours  when  organized  crime  is  alleged),  whereupon 
their  statements  are  taken  and  they  are  informed  of  the 
charges  against  them.  Within  seventy-two  hours  of  arraign- 


331 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

ment,  the  judge  must  remand  the  arrested  person  to  prison  or 
release  him  or  her. 

Criminal  trials  in  nearly  all  cases  are  tried  by  a  judge  without 
a  jury.  The  judge  acting  alone  bases  his  or  her  verdict  on  writ- 
ten statements,  depositions,  and  expert  opinion,  although  in 
some  instances  oral  testimony  is  presented.  Defendants  have 
access  to  counsel,  and  those  unable  to  afford  legal  fees  can  be 
assigned  public  defenders.  The  quality  of  pro  bono  counsel  is 
often  inferior.  The  accused  and  his  or  her  lawyer  do  not  always 
meet  before  trial,  and  the  lawyer  may  not  appear  at  the  impor- 
tant sentencing  stage.  The  right  to  a  public  trial  is  guaranteed, 
as  is  the  right  to  confront  one's  accusers  and  to  be  provided 
with  a  translator  if  the  accused's  native  language  is  not  Spanish. 
Under  the  constitution,  the  court  must  hand  down  a  sentence 
within  four  months  of  arrest  for  crimes  carrying  a  maximum 
sentence  of  two  years  or  less,  and  within  one  year  for  crimes 
with  longer  sentences. 

The  entire  process — the  time  for  a  trial,  sentencing,  and 
appeals — often  requires  a  year  or  more.  According  to  Amnesty 
International,  a  large  number  of  persons  charged  with  crimes 
have  been  held  far  beyond  the  constitutional  limits  for  their 
detention.  The  long  trial  process  and  the  detention  of  those 
who  cannot  qualify  for  or  make  bail  are  major  causes  of 
crowded  prison  conditions. 

The  penal  code  stipulates  a  range  of  sentences  for  each 
offense.  Sentences  tend  to  be  short,  in  most  cases  not  longer 
than  seven  years.  The  actual  time  of  incarceration  is  usually 
three-fifths  of  the  sentence,  assuming  good  behavior.  Those 
sentenced  for  less  than  five  years  may  avoid  further  time  in  jail 
by  payment  of  a  bond. 

Prison  Conditions 

The  penal  system  consists  of  both  federal  and  state  correc- 
tional institutions.  The  largest  federal  prison  is  the  peniten- 
tiary for  the  Federal  District.  The  Federal  District  also  sends 
prisoners  to  four  detention  centers,  sixteen  smaller  jails,  and  a 
women's  jail.  Each  state  has  its  own  penitentiary.  There  are,  in 
addition,  more  than  2,000  municipal  jails.  As  of  the  end  of 
1993,  nearly  95,000  inmates  were  in  Mexican  prisons;  almost 
half  were  persons  still  awaiting  trial  or  sentencing. 

Overcrowding  of  prisons  is  chronic.  Mistreatment  of  prison- 
ers, the  lack  of  trained  guards,  and  inadequate  sanitary  facili- 
ties compound  the  problem.  The  United  States  Department  of 


332 


National  Security 


State's  country  reports  on  human  rights  practices  for  1992  and 
1993  state  that  an  entrenched  system  of  corruption  under- 
mines prison  authority  and  contributes  to  abuses.  Authority 
frequently  is  exercised  by  prisoners,  displacing  prison  officials. 
Violent  confrontations,  often  linked  to  drug  trafficking,  are 
common  between  rival  prison  groups. 

Mexican  prisons  also  exhibit  some  humane  qualities.  In 
1971  conjugal  visiting  rights  were  established  for  male  prison- 
ers and  later  extended  to  females.  Prisoners  held  at  the  penal 
colony  on  the  Islas  Tres  Marias  off  the  coast  of  Nayarit  are  per- 
mitted to  bring  their  entire  families  to  live  temporarily.  Women 
are  permitted  to  keep  children  under  five  years  of  age  with 
them. 

Based  on  interviews  at  a  smaller  state  prison,  United  States 
penologist  William  V.  Wilkinson  found  in  1990  that  serious 
overcrowding,  lack  of  privacy,  and  poor  prison  diets  were  the 
most  common  complaints.  Wilkinson  found  no  deliberate  mis- 
treatment of  inmates.  The  prison  fare  generally  was  supple- 
mented by  food  supplied  by  prisoners'  families  or  purchased 
from  outside.  Prisoners  with  money  could  buy  items  such  as 
television  sets  and  sports  equipment.  Through  bribery,  prison- 
ers could  be  assigned  to  highly  prized  individual  cells,  where 
even  air  conditioners  were  permitted. 

A  major  building  program  by  the  CNDH  added  800  prison 
spaces  in  1993  and  1994.  In  1991  Mexico's  only  maximum  secu- 
rity facility,  Almoloya  de  Juarez,  was  completed.  Major  drug 
traffickers  were  transferred  to  it  from  other  prisons.  The 
prison's  408  individual  cells  are  watched  by  closed-circuit  televi- 
sion and  the  most  modern  technical  and  physical  security 
equipment.  Violence  in  prisons  is  a  constant  problem  as  a 
result  of  overcrowding,  lack  of  security,  and  the  mixing  of  male 
and  female  prisoners  and  of  accused  and  sentenced  criminals. 

Imprisonment  of  peasants,  often  for  growing  marijuana, 
puts  a  heavy  demand  on  the  system.  Through  the  efforts  of 
CNDH,  a  program  of  early  release  and  parole  benefited  1,000 
people  incarcerated  on  charges  of  growing  marijuana  in  1993. 

Under  the  terms  of  the  1977  Prisoner  Transfer  Treaty 
between  the  United  States  and  Mexico,  United  States  prisoners 
in  Mexican  jails  and  Mexican  prisoners  in  United  States  jails 
may  choose  to  serve  their  sentences  in  their  home  countries. 
An  extradition  treaty  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico 
took  effect  in  January  1980.  It  requires  the  mutual  recognition 
of  a  crime  as  defined  by  the  laws  of  each  nation.  Because  of  the 


333 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

extensive  processing  required  under  extradition  requests,  how- 
ever, informal  cooperation  has  developed  among  police  on 
both  sides  of  the  border.  Suspected  criminals  who  flee  to  the 
neighboring  country  to  escape  apprehension  routinely  are 
turned  over  without  formal  proceedings  to  police  in  the  coun- 
try where  the  crime  was  committed. 

Noncompliance  with  the  Prisoner  Transfer  Treaty  has  occa- 
sionally created  friction  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico. 
The  United  States  strongly  criticized  Mexico's  decision  in  1988 
to  release  William  Morales,  a  leader  of  the  Puerto  Rican  Armed 
National  Liberation  Front,  who  was  wanted  for  a  series  of 
bombings  in  New  York  in  1978.  Mexico  rejected  a  United  States 
extradition  request  even  though  a  Mexican  court  had  found 
Morales  extraditable.  Washington  objected  particularly  to  the 
initial  Mexican  characterization  of  Morales  as  a  "political 
fighter." 

The  death  penalty  has  not  been  applied  in  Mexico  since 
1929,  when  the  assassin  of  president-elect  Obregon  was  exe- 
cuted. The  federal  death  penalty  was  abolished  under  the  Fed- 
eral Penal  Code  of  1930,  and  by  1975  all  state  codes  also  had 
eliminated  the  death  penalty.  The  military,  however,  still  holds 
certain  offenses  as  punishable  by  death,  including  insubordina- 
tion with  violence  causing  the  death  of  a  superior  officer,  cer- 
tain kinds  of  looting,  offenses  against  military  honor,  and 
treason. 

Narcotics  Trafficking 

Mexico  is  a  major  source  of  heroin  and  marijuana  destined 
for  the  United  States,  as  well  as  the  principal  route  of  transit  for 
South  American  cocaine.  In  1994  Mexico  supplied  60  to  80 
percent  of  marijuana  imported  into  the  United  States,  and 
Mexican  heroin  accounted  for  20  percent  of  the  United  States 
market.  The  United  States  government  estimates  that  50  to  70 
percent  of  cocaine  smuggled  into  the  United  States  comes  by 
way  of  Mexico,  most  of  it  entering  Mexico  from  Colombia  by 
private  aircraft  or  ship,  then  transported  by  land  across  the 
United  States-Mexican  border. 

Drug  abuse  among  Mexicans  has  remained  relatively  low, 
although  cocaine  use  is  on  the  rise,  particularly  along  the  bor- 
der area,  in  major  tourist  centers,  in  large  universities,  and 
among  street  children  in  Mexico  City.  The  Mexican  attorney 
general  has  said  that  Mexico  is  fast  becoming  a  drug-consum- 
ing nation.  He  cited  economic  hardship,  urbanization,  and  the 


334 


National  Security 


collapse  of  traditional  family  life  as  primary  causes.  A  national 
drug  control  campaign,  instituted  in  1992,  introduced  drug 
education  in  schools,  gave  extensive  publicity  to  prevention 
measures,  and  created  a  program  to  assist  hospitalized  drug 
addicts. 

Coordination  of  United  States  and  Mexican  efforts  to  com- 
bat drug  trafficking  increased  greatly  during  the  terms  of  presi- 
dents Salinas  (1988-94)  and  Zedillo  (1994-  ).  Mexico  widened 
the  scope  and  intensity  of  its  counternarcotics  effort,  increas- 
ing personnel  and  budgets  threefold  between  1989  and  1993. 
As  in  the  past,  corruption  among  the  police  at  both  low  and 
higher  levels,  lax  enforcement,  and  weak  legal  constraints  have 
continued  to  hinder  the  effectiveness  of  Mexico's  interdiction 
campaign. 

Cooperation  between  the  two  countries  on  narcotic  crop 
eradication  dates  from  1961.  For  two  decades  until  Mexico 
assumed  all  of  the  costs  of  the  programs  in  1993,  the  United 
States  gave  financial  support  of  as  much  as  US$20  million  a 
year  to  the  antidrug  campaign.  DEA  agents  continue  to  serve 
in  Mexico,  and  the  United  States  supplies  leased  helicopters  to 
aid  Mexico's  efforts. 

In  1992  the  United  States  estimated  that  about  6,600  hec- 
tares of  opium  poppies  used  in  the  production  of  heroin  had 
been  eradicated,  representing  50  percent  of  the  opium  poppy 
crop.  The  potential  amount  of  heroin  that  could  be  produced 
increased  to  6  tons  in  1994  from  4.9  tons  in  1993.  Some  8,500 
hectares  of  marijuana  under  cultivation,  or  44  percent  of  the 
crop,  were  destroyed  in  1994.  In  many  areas,  marijuana  is  diffi- 
cult to  detect  because  it  is  planted  with  corn  or  in  small  plots 
concealed  by  trees  or  shrubs. 

Cocaine  shipments  generally  reach  Mexico  from  Central 
America  by  plane  or  are  shipped  to  Mexican  ports  on  the 
Pacific.  They  are  then  trucked  to  locations  throughout  Mexico 
for  later  transshipment  over  land  to  the  Mexican-United  States 
border.  In  1990  a  joint  United  States-Mexico  air  interception 
program  was  launched.  The  Mexican/United  States  unit 
responsible  is  the  Northern  Border  Response  Force.  It  consists 
of  1,800  members,  overwhelmingly  Mexican.  Their  equipment 
includes  UH-1H  transport  helicopters  leased  from  the  United 
States  and  Citation  II  tracker  aircraft.  The  DEA  and  the  United 
States  military  supply  radar  intelligence.  The  success  of  the  air 
interdiction  operation  has  forced  traffickers  to  depend  more 
on  drugs  delivered  by  sea  or  hidden  in  vehicles.  In  1994  the 


335 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


Northern  Border  Response  Force  seized  22  tons  of  cocaine, 
about  half  of  the  amount  seized  in  1993. 

Suffer  drug  trafficking  penalties  have  been  introduced  in 
the  Federal  Penal  Code,  a  Law  covering  asset  seizures  has  been 
passed,  and  laundering  operations  through  domestic  or  for- 
eign banks  have  been  made  more  difficult.  Few  major  traffick- 
ers have  been  arrested,  however.  Although  corruption  remains 
a  persistent  problem,  some  limited  success  has  been  achieved 
in  prosecuting  public  officials — who  face  twenty-five-  to  forty- 
vear  sentences — for  drug-related  crimes.  The  murder  of  Cardi- 
nal Juan  Jesus  Posadas  Ocampo  in  a  shoot-out  among  drug  traf- 
fickers near  the  Guadalajara  airport  in  1993  brought  public 
outrage.  Whether  Cardinal  Posadas  was  a  target  of  the  attack  or 
was  shot  accidentally  was  not  clear.  Many  were  arrested,  includ- 
ing a  number  of  federal  and  state  police.  Other  gunmen,  how- 
ever, were  able  to  escape  aboard  a  departing  scheduled  aircraft, 
and  the  failure  of  police  to  capture  the  gunmen  suggested  col- 
lusion. 

Although  laws  on  money  transfers  have  been  tightened,  it 
remains  relatively  simple  to  disguise  the  source  of  drug  money 
bv  making  cash  transactions  in  currency  exchange  houses 
along  the  United  States  border.  Mexican  drug  cartels  have  little 
difficulty  converting  their  profits  into  legitimate  business  oper- 
ations and  real  estate.  Mexico  also  plays  a  critical  role  in  the 
supply  of  precursor  chemicals  needed  bv  South  American  pro- 
ducers of  cocaine  and  heroin.  Most  chemicals  can  be  pur- 
chased in  Mexico  and  can  transit  Mexican  ports  without 
detection  bv  Mexican  customs. 

Sensitivities  over  what  Mexico  views  as  United  States  pres- 
sures on  its  sovereignty  have  hampered  cooperation  over  drug 
interdiction.  The  19S5  kidnapping  and  murder  of  DEA  agent 
Enrique  Camarena  caused  lingering  tension,  in  part  because  of 
evidence  of  complicity  bv  Mexican  security  forces  linked  with 
the  drug  trade.  In  1990  bounty  hunters  hired  by  the  DEA  cap- 
tured a  Mexican  doctor  believed  to  have  participated  in  the 
torture  of  Camarena.  He  was  spirited  to  the  United  States  for 
trial,  and  his  conviction  in  a  United  States  court  was  upheld  by 
the  United  States  Supreme  Court  despite  Mexican  protests 
over  what  it  viewed  as  violations  of  Mexican  sovereignty  and 
international  law.  Mexico's  indignation  over  the  United  States 
action  resulted  in  a  revision  of  the  rules  under  which  the  DEA 
operates  in  Mexico.

Security  Concerns  for  the  1 990s  and  Beyond 

Since  the  EZLN  uprising  in  Chiapas  began  in  1994,  the  Mex- 
ican armed  forces  have  assumed  a  much  higher  profile.  The 
reluctance  of  the  armed  forces  and  Zapatistas  to  engage  in  full- 
scale  hostilities,  the  relatively  low  number  of  casualties  in  the 
uprising,  and  the  idiosyncrasies  of  Mexico's  "revolutionary" 
political  culture  suggest,  however,  that  the  Chiapas  conflict  will 
not  necessarily  replicate  the  violent  pattern  of  the  Central 
American  guerrilla  wars  of  the  1970s  and  1980s. 

Analysts  predict  that  the  Mexican  armed  forces  will  continue 
a  prominent  role  in  narcotics  interdiction  efforts,  as  the  Mexi- 
can drug  cartels,  bolstered  by  their  links  to  international  orga- 
nized crime,  attempt  to  consolidate  their  territorial  power  and 
undermine  state  authority.  Observers  also  expect  that  the  Mex- 
ican navy  will  assume  a  more  prominent  role  in  protecting 
Mexico's  EEZ  and  combatting  illegal  immigration  and  smug- 
gling. For  the  foreseeable  future,  Mexico  will  continue  to  rely 
on  the  United  States  hemispheric  defense  umbrella  for  its 
external  security  needs.

A  concise  history  of  the  Mexican  armed  forces  and  an  over- 
view of  the  service  branches  as  of  the  mid-1980s  can  be  found 
in  the  section  on  Mexico  by  Adrian  J.  English  in  Armed  Forces  of 
Latin  America.  Edwin  Lieuwen's  Mexican  Militarism  is  a  full  study 
of  the  modern  military  during  its  formative  period.  The  Modern 
Mexican  Military,  edited  by  David  Ronfeldt,  includes  contribu- 
tions by  several  authorities  on  the  national  defense  system. 
Georges  Fauriol's  article,  "Mexico:  In  a  Superpower's  Shadow," 
treats  what  Mexico  considers  as  its  security  threats  and  weighs 
its  military  capabilities. 

Adolfo  Aguilar  Zinser  appraises  the  attitude  of  Mexican  mili- 
tary officers  toward  civilian  society  and  politics  as  of  1990  in 
"Civil-Military  Relations  in  Mexico."  Generals  in  the  Palacio  by 
Roderic  A.  Camp  and  an  article  by  William  S.  Ackroyd,  "Mili- 
tary Professionalism,  Education,  and  Political  Behavior  in 
Mexico,"  examine  the  important  role  of  the  military  training 
and  education  system. 

Little  up-to-date  material  has  been  published  on  the  organi- 
zational structure  and  operational  capabilities  of  the  Mexican 
armed  forces.  Rene  Luria's  brief  survey  in  1992,  "Defense  Pol- 


337 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 


icy  and  the  Armed  Forces  of  Mexico,"  summarizes  some 
aspects,  although  more  recent  developments  are  not  included. 
Discussion  in  this  chapter  of  military  units,  personnel 
strengths,  and  weapons  systems  is  based  in  part  on  The  Military 
Balance,  produced  annually  by  the  International  Institute  for 
Strategic  Studies  in  London.  (For  further  information  and

Glossary 


amparo — A  category  of  legal  actions  that  guards  individual  civil 
rights.  Literally,  amparo  signifies  protection,  assistance,  or 
human  refuge. 

corporatist,  corporatism — A  political  system  in  which  various 
groups  (for  instance,  the  military,  labor,  and  peasants)  are 
organized  into  official  constituencies.  The  various  constit- 
uencies influence  government  policy  and  are  supported 
by  government  patronage. 

Contadora — A  diplomatic  initiative  launched  by  a  January 
1983  meeting  on  Contadora  Island  off  the  Pacific  coast  of 
Panama,  by  which  the  "Core  Four"  mediator  countries  of 
Mexico,  Venezuela,  Colombia,  and  Panama  sought  to  pre- 
vent through  negotiations  a  regional  conflagration  among 
the  Central  American  states  of  Guatemala,  El  Salvador, 
Honduras,  Nicaragua,  and  Costa  Rica.  In  September  1984, 
the  negotiating  process  produced  a  draft  treaty,  the  Conta- 
dora Acta,  which  was  judged  acceptable  by  the  govern- 
ment of  Nicaragua  but  rejected  by  the  other  four  Central 
American  states  concerned.  The  process  was  suspended 
unofficially  in  June  1986  when  the  Central  American  gov- 
ernments refused  to  sign  a  revised  Acta.  The  Contadora 
process  was  effectively  superseded  by  direct  negotiations 
among  the  Central  American  states. 

ejido — A  landholding  peasant  community  or  the  land  owned 
collectively  by  the  members  of  such  a  community.  An  ejido, 
according  to  Mexican  legislation,  is  a  legal  entity  of  the 
"social  interest  sector,"  and  its  jurisdiction  is  in  the  hands 
of  Mexican-born  peasants.  Its  holdings  consist  of  the  ejidal 
plots,  i.e.,  individual  farming  plots,  the  school  plots,  the 
ejidal  urban  zones,  the  houses  and  annexes  to  each  plot, 
and  any  water  resources  and  forest  areas  associated  with 
the  community.  Two  basic  kinds  of  ejidos  exist:  the  "individ- 
ual" ejido,  in  which  land  tenure  and  ownership  are  legally 
vested  in  a  community  but  cropland  is  allocated  by  plots 
(parcelas)  on  a  semipermanent  basis  among  the  individual 
ejidatarios  (ejido  members);  and  the  "collective"  ejido,  in 
which  land  resources  are  pooled  for  collectively  organized 
production.  A  majority  of  ejidos  are  of  the  individual  kind. 

fiscal  year  (FY) — Mexico's  fiscal  year  is  the  calendar  year.

Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Where  reference  is  made  to  United  States  aid  appropria- 
tions or  disbursements,  the  United  States  government's  fis- 
cal year,  which  runs  from  October  1  to  September  30,  is 
used  with  the  date  of  reference  drawn  from  the  year  in 
which  the  period  ends.  For  example,  FY  1995  began  on 
October  1,  1994,  and  ended  on  September  30,  1995. 
gross  domestic  product  (GDP) — A  measure  of  the  total  value  of 
goods  and  services  produced  by  the  domestic  economy 
during  a  given  period,  usually  one  year.  Obtained  by  add- 
ing the  value  contributed  by  each  sector  of  the  economy  in 
the  form  of  profits,  compensation  to  employees,  and 
depreciation  (consumption  of  capital).  Only  domestic 
production  is  included,  not  income  arising  from  invest- 
ments and  possessions  owned  abroad;  hence  the  use  of  the 
word  domestic  to  distinguish  GDP  from  gross  national  prod- 
uct (q.v.). 

gross  national  product  (GNP) — The  total  market  value  of  all 
final  goods  and  services  produced  by  an  economy  during  a 
year.  Obtained  by  adding  the  gross  domestic  product  (q.v.) 
and  the  income  received  from  abroad  by  residents  and 
subtracting  payments  remitted  abroad  to  nonresidents. 

import-substitution  industrialization  (ISI) — An  economic 
development  strategy  that  emphasizes  the  growth  of 
domestic  industries,  often  by  import  protection  using  tar- 
iff and  nontariff  measures.  Proponents  favor  the  export  of 
industrial  goods  over  primary  products. 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) — Established  along  with 
the  World  Bank  (q.v.)  in  1945,  the  IMF  is  a  specialized 
agency  affiliated  with  the  United  Nations  (UN)  that  takes 
responsibility  for  stabilizing  international  exchange  rates 
and  payments.  The  main  business  of  the  IMF  is  the  provi- 
sion of  loans  to  its  members  when  they  experience  bal- 
ance-of-payments  difficulties.  These  loans  often  carry 
conditions  that  require  substantial  internal  economic 
adjustments  by  the  recipients. 

maquiladoras — Assembly  plants  that  are  also  called  "in-bond" 
industries.  Established  by  Mexico's  Border  Industrializa- 
tion Program  during  the  mid-1960s  to  absorb  the  unem- 
ployed along  the  border  with  the  United  States  following 
the  termination  of  the  bracero  (migrant  Mexican  worker) 
program  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico  in  1964. 
Machinery,  equipment,  and  components  were  initially 
allowed  to  be  imported  duty-free  for  processing  or  assem-

Glossary 


bly  within  a  twenty-kilometer  strip  along  the  border  as 
long  as  all  the  imported  products  were  subsequently  reex- 
ported. Later  legislation  permitted  the  establishment  of 
in-bond  industries  anywhere  in  Mexico  except  Mexico 
City,  Guadalajara,  and  Monterrey.  End-product  output 
from  the  assembly  operations  of  the  in-bond  industries 
cannot  be  sold  within  Mexico. 

Mesoamerica — literally  middle  America.  Anthropological 
term  for  region  from  central  Mexico  to  northern  Hondu- 
ras that  contained  advanced  civilizations  before  the  arrival 
of  the  Europeans. 

new  peso  (NMex$) — Mexican  monetary  unit  divided  into  100 
centavos.  The  new  peso  replaced  the  peso  (q.v.)  on  Janu- 
ary 1,  1993,  at  the  rate  of  1  new  peso  =  1,000  pesos.  At  that 
time,  US$1  =  NMex$3.1.  In  April  1997,  US$1  =  NMex$7.9. 

parastatal — Corporation  wholly  or  partially  government-owned 
and  managed.  Corporate  directors  general  are  appointed 
by  the  president  of  Mexico.  Although  ostensibly  managed 
semiautonomously,  boards  of  directors  are  subject  to  the 
political  guidelines  of  the  government. 

peso  (Mex$) — Mexican  currency  prior  to  1993.  At  par  with  the 
dollar  in  the  nineteenth  century,  the  Mexican  government 
occasionally  devalued  the  peso  in  the  first  half  of  the  twen- 
tieth century.  From  1954  until  1975,  the  peso's  value  was 
fixed  at  US$1  =  Mex$12.49.  In  1976  the  peso  was  allowed 
to  float  and  depreciated  to  about  US$1  =  Mex$100  in 
1982.  By  1992,  however,  the  peso's  value  had  fallen  to 
US$1  =  Mex$3,000,  and  a  new  currency,  the  new  peso 
(NMex$ — q.v.),  was  introduced,  replacing  the  peso  at  the 
rate  of  1  new  peso  =  1,000  pesos. 

Sandinista — Originally  a  member  of  the  Marxist  group  in  Nica- 
ragua attempting  to  overthrow  the  Nicaraguan  govern- 
ment in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  The  group  took  its  name 
from  Augusto  Cesar  Sandino,  who  led  a  guerrilla  struggle 
against  United  States  occupation  of  Nicaragua  in  the 
1930s.  The  political  arm  of  the  group,  the  Sandinista 
National  Liberation  Front  (Frente  Sandinista  de  Lib- 
eracion  Nacional — FSLN),  was  the  national  government  of 
Nicaragua  from  July  1979  to  April  1990.  After  the  late 
1970s,  the  term  Sandinista  is  used  for  a  member  or  sup- 
porter of  the  FSLN  or  as  the  adjectival  form  of  the  FSLN. 

World  Bank — The  informal  name  used  to  designate  a  group  of 
four  affiliated  international  institutions:  the  International 


385 


Mexico:  A  Country  Study 

Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD),  the 
International  Development  Association  (IDA),  the  Inter- 
national Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  the  Multilateral 
Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA).  The  IBRD,  estab- 
lished in  1945,  has  the  primary  purpose  of  providing  loans 
at  market-related  rates  of  interest  to  developing  countries 
at  more  advanced  stages  of  development.  The  IDA,  a 
legally  separate  loan  fund  but  administered  by  the  staff  of 
the  IBRD,  was  set  up  in  1960  to  furnish  credits  to  the  poor- 
est developing  countries  on  much  easier  terms  than  those 
of  conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC,  founded  in  1956, 
supplements  the  activities  of  the  IBRD  through  loans  and 
assistance  designed  specifically  to  encourage  the  growth  of 
productive  private  enterprises  in  less  developed  countries. 
The  MIGA,  founded  in  1988,  insures  private  foreign 
investment  in  developing  countries  against  various  non- 
commercial risks.  The  president  and  certain  officers  of  the 
IBRD  hold  the  same  positions  in  the  IFC.  The  four  institu- 
tions are  owned  by  the  governments  of  the  countries  that 
subscribe  their  capital.  To  participate  in  the  World  Bank, 
member  states  must  first  belong  to  the  International  Mon- 
etary Fund  (q.u).
