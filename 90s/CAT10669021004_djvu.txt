The DxMONITOR Animal Health Report is distributed quarterly as part of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory 
Reporting System (VDLRS). The VDLRS is a cooperative effort of the American Association of Veterinary 
Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD), the United States Animal Health Association (USAHA), and the United States 
Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA:APHIS). The purpose of the 
DxMONITOR is to report trends of confirmed disease diagnoses and animal health data collected from veterinary 


diagnostic laboratories and the USDA:APHIS. 


Caution should be taken when extrapolating information reported in the Dx MONITOR due to the inherent biases of 
submitted specimens. Trends should be interpreted with care. An increase in the number of positive tests for a given 
diagnosis/agent may be the result of a true increase in prevalence, however, it may only reflect a new State testing 
requirement, a heightened awareness of the condition, or an increase in the number of laboratories reporting data. 


For this issue, the disease reporting period for new data was April 1, 1992 through June 30, 1992. 
Data have been reported by diagnostic laboratories in the States indicated below, from the National 
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), and from the APHIS:Veterinary Services program staffs.

Transmissible Venereal Papilloma 
Diagnosed in Swine 


A herd of 300 sows maintained primarily to raise and 
sell breeding animals had an unusually high incidence 
of "bloody urine" in young boars. Approximately 70 
percent of the boars (nearly 2,000/year) developed 
"bloody" urine between 3-5 months of age. Affected 
animals often had swollen prepuces caused by 1 to 2 
liters of retained, red-brown, discolored urine. 


Two of the affected boars were necropsied. Gross 
and histopathologic lesions were limited to the mucosa 
of the preputial sheath. The entire preputial lining 
was covered by irregular papillomatous growths 
measuring 1-2 cm in diameter. There were no 
growths on the penis of either animal. The urine 
trapped within the prepuce contained blood, a few 
epithelial cells, bacteria, and keratinized debris. 


Microscopic examination of preputial masses revealed 
multiple squamous papillomas (warts) characterized 
by extreme and uneven hyperplasia (acanthosis), 
parakeratosis, and hyperkeratosis of the preputial 
epithelium with marked prolongation of rete pegs. An 
admixture of inflammatory cells was in the dermis. 
The center of each papilloma appeared to have 
varying degrees of necrosis with bacteria present 
within the necrotic debris. 


Preputial tissues from the affected areas of each boar 
were cultured for viruses. Cytopathic effects occurred 
in porcine fallopian tube cell cultures by 5 days post- 
inoculation. As yet, the virus has not been identified, 
but it is suspected to be a papilloma virus. 


Treatments currently being used are manual 
excoriation of a small area of the affected tissue and 
flushing of the prepuce with neomycin solution. The 
lesions disappear within 10 days, possibly due to a 
self-generated immune response. We are currently 
evaluating autogenous vaccines for the treatment and 
prevention of this disorder. There is no evidence that 
the disease has spread from this herd. 


Transmissible venereal papilloma should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis of hematuria 


and preputial swelling in swine. Manual palpation and 
visual examination of the preputial mucosa provides 
sufficient evidence for a presumptive diagnosis. The 
diagnosis can be confirmed by histologic examination 
of affected tissue and virus isolation. Genital 
papillomas of swine appear to be uncommon. A 
literature review revealed only a single occurrence in 
1961 (1,2). It is possible, however, that the disease 
often goes unrecognized and is currently under- 
diagnosed and under-reported. 


It is interesting to note that the lesions in the present 
case are similar to condyloma acuminatum of man, a 
genital papilloma (1). Numerous animals, including 
non-human primates, cattle, horses, dogs and bears, 
have been recognized as having papilloma virus 
infections of the lower genital tract; however, none are 
suitable as animal models for research on this disease 
for various reasons (3). The pig might meet the 
requirements as a more acceptable animal model.

Feline Fur Mite Reappears in Florida 


Mites collected from a 5-year-old neutered cat were 
identified by the National Veterinary Services 
Laboratories (NVSL) as the feline fur mite 
(Lynxacarus radovskyi tenorio). The NVSL indicated 
that this mite was first identified in 1974 on cats in 
Hawaii. Since then, it has been identified in Fiji, 
Puerto Rico, and Australia. The mite was also found 
in Florida in 1979 (Coral Gables) and 1990 (Volusia 
County). The current finding involved a cat from 
Titusville (Brevard County). Brevard and Volusia 
counties are contiguous.

Competitive Enzyme-Linked 
Immunosorbent Assay (C-ELISA): 
Now an Official Test for 
Bluetongue Exports to Canada 


A recent decision by Agriculture Canada has made 
the bluetongue (BT) competitive enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA) an official test for 
the importation of live ruminants and their semen and 
embryos into Canada. Effective August 1, 1992, either 
the BT C-ELISA or the BT agar gel immunodiffusion 
(AGID) test is acceptable for qualifying animals to 
enter Canada. Testing with either C-ELISA or AGID 
will be limited to laboratories accredited to do BT 
testing. The BT C-ELISA is likely to become the only 
official BT test for Canada. 


The C-ELISA was first described by Dr. John 
Anderson, Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, 
England, using a monoclonal antibody he developed. 
This test was evaluated by scientists in Australia, 
Canada, and at the National Veterinary Services 
Laboratories (NVSL). The evaluation was 
coordinated by scientists from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria. Dr. 
Anderson’s C-ELISA procedure, after some 
modification, was established as the "gold standard." 
DiagXotics, Inc., Wilton, Connecticut, developed a 
commercial BT C-ELISA, the Blue Plate Special, 
which was evaluated against this "gold standard" and 
was licensed and approved by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA). The Canadian scientists also 
evaluated the Blue Plate Special and concurred with 
the USDA decision. 


The BT C-ELISA test is slightly more sensitive than 
the BT AGID; therefore, it is possible to have a 
positive BT C-ELISA but a negative BT AGID test on 
the same serum. The BT C-ELISA test is also more 
specific than the BT AGID; therefore, many of the 
BT AGID positive samples will be C-ELISA negative. 
Many of the animals exposed to epizootic hemorrhagic 
disease virus will be BT AGID positive but BT C- 
ELISA negative. In addition, nonspecific positive BT 
AGID reactions have been observed.

Surveillance for Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Continues in the U.S. 


Histopathologic examination of bovine brain 
specimens is the most practical way to conduct 
surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
(BSE), the most recent addition to the group of 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. 
Information regarding surveillance examinations for 
BSE in US. cattle is needed by various individuals 
and groups including regulatory agencies for actions 
that can affect domestic and international trade. 


A cooperative project between Iowa State University 
(ISU) and the USDA:APHIS was initiated in 1990 to 
examine brain specimens from cattle which could have 
had BSE. Specimen submission criteria were that (1) 
the cattle be 2 years of age or older, (2) they have 
documented signs of neurologic disease, and (3) they 
have received protein supplement as a substantial part 
of their ration. Also, examinations of rabies suspect 
cases that were rabies negative were undertaken at the 
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, and 
at ISU. In addition, efforts were made to obtain 
information from veterinary diagnostic laboratories 
regarding results of bovine neurologic examinations. 


Collectively, 474 bovine brain examinations have been 
reported (as of August 26, 1992). None of the brains 
have been found to contain lesions with the 
characteristics and distribution typical for BSE. 
Lesions characterized by inflammation (e.g. listeriosis), 
degeneration (e.g. polioencephalomalacia), and 
neoplasia (e.g. meningioma) have been found; 
however, most of the cases (approximately 50%) have 
been categorized as no significant findings.

Florida and Louisiana have advanced from 
Class B to Class A status, leaving only Texas as 
a Class B State. The decrease in number of 
brucellosis reactor herds detected from April 
through June, 1992, as compared to the same 
quarter of 1991, was led by Texas which had 54 
fewer reactor herds detected. Only Georgia 
had more reactor herds detected during this 
period of 1992 than during the same period of 
1991 (Figure 1). 


For the entire U.S. there were 132 reactor herds detected from April through June, 1992. That was 111 fewer herds 
than were identified from April through June of 1991. Texas had 67 of the 132 reactor herds detected (Figure 2). 


The U.S. has had 40 percent fewer (483 vs. 809) brucellosis reactor herds detected during the last 4 quarters than 
during the previous 4 quarters (Figure 3). For the calendar year-to-date there have been 239 reactor herds found, 
210 fewer than were found through June of 1991. Only Iowa and Georgia have had more reactor herds detected in 


1992 than during the same period in 1991 (one more each).

For the first and second quarters of 1992 
(January through June), the most positive tests 
for bovine leukosis (2,084) were reported for 
specimens from the Northeast (NE) region. 
During that period, more than twice as many 
total specimens from the NE were tested as 
from any other region. There were 1,270 
positive tests reported for specimens from the 
Central (CL) region, with 4,960 total tests 
performed on such specimens. 


There were no more than 67 specimens 
reported as testing positive for bovine 
paratuberculosis from any region for the first 
quarter of 1992. Over 800 specimens from the 
Central region were tested to find those 67 
positives. No other region had more than 159 
total tests reported for the quarter.

II. Etiologic Agents Associated with Calf Diarrhea 


[|] VDLRS Data Review: Agents of Calf Diarrhea, July 1990 - June 1992 


The Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Reporting 
System (VDLRS) has been collecting data on etiologic 
agents commonly associated with diarrhea in calves (8 
weeks of age or less) since 1990. These agents 
include Escherichia coli (ECO), Salmonella spp. 
(SAL), coronavirus (COR), rotavirus (RTV), bovine 
viral diarrhea (BVD) virus, cryptosporidia (CRY), and 
coccidia (COC). A review of these diagnostic 
laboratory data was conducted to provide a descriptive 
overview of agents associated with specimens 
submitted from calves with diarrhea. 


For this review, data were examined for July 1990 
through June 1992. Positive tests for etiologic agents 
associated with calf diarrhea were reported by 
laboratories in 13 States (all of the States with a 
VDLRS laboratory except Ohio, Nebraska, and 
Texas). In total, data on calf specimen submissions 
from 34 States were reported to the VDLRS during 
the period reviewed. 


While the numbers of positive tests reported by 
VDLRS participants do not indicate how many total 
calves had diarrhea associated with a given etiologic 
agent, the numbers should give a relative idea of 
which agents may have been most common. Using 
these data to make inferences about the relative 
frequency with which these etiologic agents occurred 
in submitted specimens does assume that any 
specimen examined for one potential etiologic agent 
was also examined for other agents. It is also 
assumed that the likelihood of a laboratory finding a 
given agent in a specimen is equal to the likelihood of 
finding any other agent in that specimen. These 
assumptions undoubtedly do not hold in all cases. 


It should be recognized that some laboratories have 
an interest in, and do extra testing for, particular 
agents or diagnoses. Thus, a region in which a 
laboratory was doing special interest testing may have 


had relatively more positives reported for that agent of 


interest than a region without such a laboratory. 


In addition, VDLRS laboratories may not be 
representative of all laboratories in the U.S. About 
two-thirds of all States do not have a laboratory 
currently participating in the VDLRS. It is 
interesting, however, to note that a significant 
proportion of all calves less than or equal to 8 weeks 
of age in the U.S. were located in areas represented 


12 - DxMONITOR (Fall 1992) 





by the data reported to the VDLRS over the 2-year 
period. The 13 States with laboratories reporting data 
had 14.4 million calves in their 1991 calf crops 
(National Agricultural Statistics Service, 1992). That 
was 37 percent of the total calf crop for the U.S. In 
addition, data were reported on calf specimens from 
21 other States during the 2-year period. For calendar 
year 1991, the 34 States for which testing on at least 
one calf specimen was reported had 33.6 million calves 
or 86 percent of the U.S. calf crop. 


The greatest caveat to interpreting diagnostic 
laboratory data is the fact that diagnostic specimens 
are never submitted to a laboratory for many cases of 
animal disease. Thus, caution must be used when 
attempting to extrapolate to the general population 
from data reported on laboratory specimens. 


Overall Findings 


VDLRS data show that, from July 1990 through June 
1992, the agent most commonly found in specimens 
from diarrheic calves was cryptosporidia (Figure 12). 
During the period, 1,643 positive tests for 
cryptosporidia were reported, with Escherichia coli 
and rotavirus next with 1,494 and 1,492 positive tests, 
respectively. The least often found of the seven 
agents were coccidia (257) and BVD virus (398). 


There was not a great difference in the relative 
frequency with which the various agents were found in

beef calf specimens as compared to dairy calf 
specimens, although positive tests for all seven of the 
agents were more often reported from dairy than from 
beef. The most common agents among beef calf 
specimens were rotavirus (350), cryptosporidia (345), 
and coronavirus (250), while among dairy calves the 
three most common agents were cryptosporidia (890), 
E. coli (853), and rotavirus (797). 


Patterns by Region 


There were differences between the various regions of 
the U.S. as to the most commonly found agents 
(Figures 13 and 14). While calf specimens from the 
Central (CL) and North-Central (NC) regions most 
often had cryptosporidia detected (26% and 30%

of all agents found, respectively), those from the 
Mideast (ME) and Northeast (NE) had E. coli 
detected more often than any of the other agents. In 
fact, of the 758 tests which were positive for a 
diarrheal agent in specimens from NE region calves, 
72 percent (546) were E. coli. Specimens from 
Florida (FL), the Southeast (SE), and Pacific (PA) 
regions had rotavirus reported most often (33%, 37%, 
and 28% of all agents found, respectively). In the 
Mountain (MN) region, coronavirus was the agent 
found most commonly (47% of all positive tests). 
Coronavirus was also the second most commonly 
reported agent from calf specimens from the FL and 
SE regions. 


Patterns by Region and Class of Calf 


Figures 15 and 16 show the regional totals of positive 
tests for each of the seven agents which could be 
identified as coming from beef calves specimens. 
Although BVD virus was only the sixth most common 
agent reported among all beef calf specimens 
(105/1,400 or 8% of all positives), in the MN region it 
accounted for 13 percent (18/137) of all the positive 
tests reported. Thus, BVD was the fourth most 
commonly reported agent in beef calf specimens from 
that region. 


The most commonly found agent in beef calf 
specimens from the MN region was coronavirus 
(65/137; 47%), and the most common from CL region 
beef calf specimens was cryptosporidia (69/219, 32%). 
Cryptosporidia was also the most commonly found

(204/604 or 34% of all agents found). 


Among all beef calf specimens, Salmonella was only 
the fifth most commonly reported agent with 121 
(9%) of the 1,400 positive tests; however, Salmonella 
spp. represented 19 percent (66/341) of all positive 
tests of beef calf specimens from the PA region. 
From the ME region, 41 percent (7/17) of beef calf 
agents were reported to have been Salmonella spp. 


Compared with other regions, E. coli made up an 
unusually high proportion of beef calf agents found in 
the NE. E. coli comprised 80 percent (20/25) of such 
agents in the NE, versus 11 percent (158/1,400) in all 
regions. 


Coccidia was the rarest agent among beef calf 
specimens (71/1,400; 5%). Compared to other 
regions, the SE had the largest proportion of beef calf 
agents found to be coccidia (15%; 6/40). 


Although coccidia was also the least found agent in 
dairy calf specimens (118/3,730; 3%), it made up 9 
percent (58/682) of all dairy calf agents reported for 
the NE region (Figure 17). E£. coli was the most 
commonly reported agent in dairy calf specimens from 
that region, with 485 of 682 (71%) agents reported to 
have been E. coli. 


The SE region had the highest percentage of 
Salmonella spp. found among dairy calf specimens for 
any region (Figure 18). Of 99 agents found in such 
specimens from the SE, 26 percent (26) were

Salmonella. Rotavirus was the most common agent 
found in dairy calf specimens from the SE (39/99). 


Similar to the findings for beef calf specimens from 
the CL region, BVD virus made up an unusually high 
percentage of agents found in dairy calf specimens 
from that region. BVD virus was the third most 
common agent among dairy calf specimens in the CL 
region with 15 percent of all agents reported. 


Dairy calf specimens from the FL region had two 
agents found in higher proportions than the average 
for all regions. Coronavirus was reported in 28 
percent of all positive tests and Salmonella spp. made 
up 23 percent of all positives. For dairy calf 
specimens from all regions, those two agents made up 
only 11 and 13 percent, respectively, of all agents.

Patterns by Quarter Year 


Among beef calf specimens (Figures 19 and 20), 
cryptosporidia was relatively more common in the 
second quarter of each year. In fact, by comparing 
the numbers from Figure 19 to those of Figure 20 
(both drawn to the same scale), it can be observed 
that cryptosporidia were much like rotavirus and 
coronavirus in that they were relatively more common 
among beef calf specimens during the second quarter 
of both 1991 and 1992. The higher numbers of agents 
found in beef calf specimens during the second 
quarter of the year is probably due to the fact that the 
second quarter is usually calving season, thus more 
calf specimens are tested and more agents are likely 
to be found. A relatively low number of all agents

was reported for both the third quarter of 1990 and 
1991. This is probably because by the third quarter of 
any year most beef calves exceed the 8 week age limit 
for reporting to the VDLRS. 


Among dairy calf specimens (Figures 21 and 22), the 
relative numbers of agents have been lowest in the 
second or third quarter of each year. Relative peaks 
have occurred in the first quarter for cryptosporidia, 
rotavirus, and coronavirus. Similar peaks have 
occurred for E. coli in the fourth quarter of the last 
two years. Salmonella spp. may have a relative peak 
in the third quarter of each year, although more data 
need to be collected to confirm such a pattern.

regions of the U.S. during the second quarter of 1992. This 
was true for both dairy and beef calf specimens, but was 
most pronounced for dairy. Of 115 dairy calf specimens 
tested from the PA region, 32 were positive. Only 9 of 172 
dairy specimens from other regions of the U.S. were 
reported to have been positive. While the total number of 
Salmonella-positive tests increased among calf specimens 
from the PA region as compared to last quarter (53 vs. 29), 
the number of positives from all other regions decreased 
(30 vs. 41).

DxMONITOR Data Submission System is 
Available Free to Interested Laboratories 


The DxMONITOR Data Submission System (DDSS) 
is available free of charge to any laboratory interested 
in participating in the Veterinary Diagnostic 
Laboratory Reporting System (VDLRS). The DDSS 
has been developed to assist laboratories participating 
in the VDLRS with transfer of captured data to Fort 
Collins. 


The system was not designed to capture data directly 
out of a laboratory's data management system. To use 
the system, data must first be captured by a laboratory 
in whatever manner works best for that particular 
laboratory. The summary totals of these data are then 
entered into the data entry screen provided as part of 
the DDSS. The reference guide leads the user 
through this process in a step-by-step manner. 


Because the system was 
written within a 
software package called 
"Epi Info", a copy of this 
program and a user’s 
guide are also included. 
Epi Info was developed 
by the Centers for 
Disease Control and the . 

World Health Organization. It has many capabilities 
including data analysis, word processing, statistics, etc. 
Epi Info may be copied for friends and colleagues. 





The following materials are included with the 
DxMONITOR Data Submission System: 


e Epi Info program diskette 
e Epi Info User’s Guide 

e DDSS program diskette 
e DDSS Reference Guide 


Please contact the staff in Fort Collins for more 


information about the system (address and telephone 
number are on the inside back cover of this issue).
