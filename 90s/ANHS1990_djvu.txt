Introduction — 1 



2 — Introduction 


ieeptng our 

atancz 


Science tells us that 
nothing can be greater 
than the sum of its parts. 

But consider, howev- 
er, the perfection of a 
snowflake. Because of 
the symmetry, lace-like 
intricacy, and uniqueness 
of its design, a snowflake 
is far more than the sim- 
ple drop of water from 
which it was made. 






Like anything in na- 
ture, each of us is also a 
mixture of component 
parts, of form and func- 
tion. What is anyone but 
an amalgamation of the 
intellectual and the ath- 
letic, of the serious and 
the spontaneous, of the 
artistic and the pragmat- 
ic, and of the physical 
and the spiritual? 


Introduction — 3 




From such a fusion of seemingly 
contradictory qualities comes • each 
one of us. But we are more than just 
“students,” “athletes,” “artists,” or 
“workers”: like the snowflake, we at- 
tain our own degree of perfection in 
the unique configuration of our com- 
ponent parts. 



4 — Introduction 






It is when we come to understand 
that each of us is an arrangement of 
talents and dreams, all merging togeth- 
er in varying amounts, that we begin to 
appreciate the importance of . . . 


KEEPING OUR BALANCE.

Social Studies Steady 


Through the scales of jus- 
tice and the balance of pow- 
er, Andrean students learn 
about the past in order to 
understand the present. Pos- 
sessing a knowledge of past 
conflicts and triumphs, stu- 
dents comprehend the im- 
pact of current events. As 
the Berlin Wall tumbles 
down and the rebellious 
flames in China flare up, An- 
drean students study these 


earth-shattering events. 
They witness, through the 
media, the U.S. invasion of 
Panama which shook Manuel 
Noriega from power. In 
studying these shocking 
events, students appreciate 
the history they have 
learned. It is this history 
which helps them under- 
stand the world they live in 
today.

“Yeah, I know how you feel. But it’s so

“Yeah.”

Team Sets Goals 
and Standards 

First-year head coach Mr. Peter Reist de- 
scribed the soccer team best when he said, 
“The strength and consistency of the seni- 
ors, and the development of the sophomore 
group, as well as the overall character of the 
squad, made my first year at Andrean one 
I’ll always remember. This team set stand- 
ards and goals for all future teams to strive 
for.” The team began the season with a loss 
against Hammond Morton, but rebounded 
by remaining unbeaten for the remainder of 
the season. The highlights of the season 
were a 1-0 win against top-ranked Portage 
and a 0-0 tie against Valparaiso. The first 
Andrean soccer team to be undefeated in 
conference play was led by MVP Mike 
Samaniego, a junior midfielder, the “four 
horsemen” defense of Tom Anderson, Mike 
Sur, Tim Hutchens, and Dennis Billena, and 
the goalkeeping of John Kerr. Most Val- 
uable Offensive Player, Dan Hruskoci, Best 
Mental Attitude winner, Oat Sinchai, and

Heckler Advances 
to Semi-State 

The Niner wrestling team posted a dual 
record of 7-5. The team celebrated wins 
over East Chicago, Hanover Central, and 
Gary Roosevelt, and captured the Diocesan 
Championship by handily defeating Bishop 
Noll. 

Most Valuable Wrestler Bob Heckler 
qualified for semi-state but lost in the second 
round. Awards went to Chuck Swallow, 
Most Improved; Russel Foster, Most Ded- 
icated; Mike McCarthy, Hardest Practicer. 
Co-captain Mike Martinez commented, 
“Everything we accomplished is due to 
Coach Sanchez and Coach Swallow. 
They’re the ones who made us work harder 
to accomplish our goals.”

to raise money for various organizations 
such as Spanish club or volleyball. After 
securing pledges from their sponsors, stu- 
dents enjoy a shortened schedule for a re- 
freshing walk in the afternoon. The reward 
for walking ten kilometers around the build-

Lady Niners Take 
Broadway 

The Andrean girls’ basketball team made 
an impression on rivals from Merrillville. 
Victories in “The Battle of Broadway” were 
common with Lady Niner teams. The Var- 
sity team had five returning seniors and one 
junior. With help from younger members of 
the J.V. team, they finished with a record of 
10-10. The JV team completed its season 
with a record of 15-3 and freshmen finished 
with nine wins and two losses.

Successful Year 
for Niners 

A young and determined team gave 
Niners a successful basketball season. The 
team had a regular season record of 15-3. 
Led by Most Valuable Player Brandon Bran- 
tley, who scored 16 points per game, and 
guard Mike Lustina, who led the team in free 
throw percentages with 76%, Niners dis- 
played impressive wins against Gary Wirt, 
Lowell, Merrillville, and a double overtime 
victory against Lake Central. 

In Sectionals, the Niners handily defeated 
Hammond Morton and then beat Hammond 
Gavit with a last second over-the-backboard 
shot by Mike Lustina. 

The Hammond Sectional champions 
played Bishop Noll in the first round of the 
Regional match-up, but after controlling 
most of the game, suffered a heartbreaking 
loss to the Warriors. It was the last game in 
the high school careers of seniors Quentin 
Peterson and Dante Brown.

Team Ranked 
19th in State 

The boys’ track team started the year at 
a slow pace, but as the season progressed 
they became very strong competitors. 
Successfully defending their titles at the 
Lake Central and Andrean Relays, the 
team also had a strong showing at the 
Bishop Noll Relays, placing fourth out of 
12 teams, one of two teams winning 
medals in every event. 

During mid-season the team was ranked 
19th in the state. At the end of the season 
the team was 12-4 qualifying 15 individual 
and four relay teams for sectionals. Jimmie 
Gray led the Niners by qualifying in six 
events. Matt Potochick, Chris Carr, Dave 
Acosta, and Jimmie Gray advanced to 
regionals in the 100-m high hurdles, high 
jump, pole vault, and 200-m dash, 
respectively. Most Valuable Fielder was 
Dave Acosta, Most Valuable Runner was 
Tim Swan, and Most Valuable Player was 
Jimmie Gray.

Niners balance work loads 


The jobs teenagers have these days 
are just so demanding! 

McDonald’s, unsurprisingly, is the in- 
stitution employing most Andrean stu- 
dents. Dairy Queen and the local 
Cinemas utilize the Niners’ help to a great 
extent. Many students have uncommon 
jobs. From a lifeguard, to a pharmacist’s 
aide, to a private tutor, to a lumber piler, 
if there is a job available, an Andrean 
student will find it. One anonymous stu- 
dent even commented that his job was 
“selling calendars.” 

The places Niners’ money is spent are 
even more interesting. Most of them 
spend their hard-earned money on 
clothes, food, gas, and tapes. Of course, 
the seniors put a significant amount into 
the bank for college funds. Health club 
memberships, insurance, vacations, and 
guitars were popular among the Niners 
too. 

The average Andrean student works 
fourteen hours a week, over a four day 
period. Although some students do not 
have a minimum number of hours to 
work, others are not as fortunate. Brian 
Barney, who works at Cafe Venezia, has 
to work 40 hours a week, which makes 
him appreciate his money. 

While some work with friends, some do 
not. Meredith Sattler commented that at 


first she did not work with friends, but now 
she has made new friends through her job at 
Au Coton in the Southlake Mall. Although 
bosses seem to be a big problem according 
to Mike Leka and Scott Conners, most work- 
ers do enjoy their jobs. A1 Mance said, 
“Lifeguarding is the most excellent summer 
job. You sit in a chair, getting the sun, 
watching girls, and you get paid for it. Top 
that.” Paul Halfman, who works at the Star 
Plaza, gets paid to watch performers. 

Experience and reponsibility play a large 
role in the attitudes students exhibit toward 
their jobs. Lori Laco, who works at 
McDonald’s, said that having a job gives her 
a sense of responsibility and prepares her 
for the real world. Chantal Foster works at 
Shellbourne Retreat Center. She said that 
having a job helps her plan her time and 
assume more responsibility. Susan Bobruk 
works at Walgreens where she learns new 
skills to prepare her for her future as a 
pharmacist. Finally, Bert Kullerstrand be- 
lieves that working at Bonne Femme Cafe 
alleviates the pressure put on parents by 
their children for money. 

Although the majority of students would 
probably choose not to work, jobs do enable 
them to enjoy their teen years in the best 
way possible; they learn responsibility, make 
money, and meet new friends.

Chantal Foster, Nina Gomez, 
Lynn Grogan, Karen Koznicki,

the following to be their Sen- 


ators: Leo Doumanian, Liz 
McMahon, Tony Mako, Roxanne 
Sakes, Sabath Smith, Craig Staf- 
ford, Nicole Taylor. 

In one of their first acts as the 
class of ’93, the following were 
selected as Senators: Becky Bil- 
lick, Susan Bisaha, Mike Hulka, 
Sarah McGuire, Jenna Novotny, 
Kelly Suchy, Beth Townsend, 
Cherilynne Villaflor.

Keeping In loud. 

Andrean is a melting pot; students from all over the area 
attend this institution. As a result, many people are aware of the 
outstanding academic record, the infamous uniforms, and the 
disciplined manners, but what most outsiders don’t know is that 
these students need a big wallet to pay their outrageous phone 
bills every month. 

Alexander Graham Bell has become the Andrean student’s 
best friend since everyone needs to communicate with others by 
telephone. However, this communication poses a straining prob- 
lem to both kids’ and parents’ bank accounts. Someone from 
Hobart who has a best friend in Valparaiso may find it necessary 
to call quite often. Every minute costs, and it all adds up to a 
tremendous amount at the end of the month. Maybe someone 
from Schererville is assigned to a group project with people from 
Gary, Munster, and Portage. In this case, it would be a lot easier 
just to drive to see the others instead of calling. But these times 
have produced a generation who needs things to come easier and 
faster to them. 

— Jessica Mallams 





EXTRA AHS Year 


A Year of Changes 



The Art Club continued its tradition of generosity by sponsoring 
a new fundraising drive to benefit Wyler’s Children’s Hospital. 
Members and friends of the Art Club worked together to raise 
money to purchase new VCR’s for the seriously ill children treated 
at the hospital. 


Faculty Fathers 

Three members of the faculty are taking a new try at fatherhood this 
year. They are Mr. Listro, father of a daughter Caitlin, and Mr. Par- 
roquin, father of a son Eduardo. Mr. Fech as well is interested in 
fatherhood of a different sort — the priesthood. He has taken his first 
steps toward joining the Basilian order. 

Students Strike Back 

Students faltering under what some termed an overly-stringent grad- 
ing scale breathed sighs of relief in the fall of 1 989 when an updated form 
of the old scale was initiated. The new scale is similar to those in use in 
most public schools, allowing a student to receive higher letter grades for 
lower percentage totals. Unfortunately for those students expecting an 
easier time because of the new scale, most teachers responded to the new 
scale with proportional adjustments in the difficulty of their tests. 

Freshmen Beat the System 

Freshmen, who have been asking for better treatment for a long as 
anyone can remember, finally made headway with the administration 
this year, getting permission for the first time to attend the annual 
Turnabout Dance. Upperclassmen were somewhat shocked by the de- 
cision, but all feelings of injustice waned as only a handful of the 
victorious freshman couples actually made it to the dance. 

Teacher of the Year 

Mr. John Szot was named by Inland Steel as the Teacher of the Year 
for 1990. Mr. Szot teaches geography and sophomore world history. He 
also coaches the golf, Academic Superbowl, and Academic Decathlon 
teams. 




TOP: The boys’ tennis team as a whole had an eventful 
season during which several individual players distin- 
guished themselves with some top-notched playing. Most 
notable among these was sophomore Jun Jao, pictured here 
with Coach Klora and teammate Brian Rosta. Jao finished 
in the final 1 6 singles players in the state. 

CENTER: Wrestler Bob Heckler had an especially good 
year, qualifying for semi-state. Bob, a senior, will leave 
behind him a young and promising wrestling team. 

ABOVE: The baseball team finished the season ranked 
1 0th in the state.

Andrean’s upstairs hallway was once again the scene 
of great political struggle as a new race for the presidency 
was undertaken by members of Mr. Horvath’s spring 
semester government classes. Pictured here is a scene 
from the nominating convention, an affair at which 
Democrats were obliged to remain standing for upwards 
of five hours while attempting to decide on a proper 
candidate. Despite their efforts, the Republicans won 
the presidency in the end.

Andrean’s Decathlon team was successful at both the regional and 
state levels this year. The team placed a easy first at the regional 
competition, taking firsts in each of the ten events. For the second 
year in a row, the team took a third place at the state contest. 
Individual members received high honors at both the state and 
regional levels. Pictured here from left to right are team members 
Jennifer DuBois, Pat Duffy, Kelley Arnold, Emix Dial, Kysha 
Armour, Jeff Foley, Jon Heuring, Eric Marcyjanik, and Ramesh Unni. 




On November 1, 1989, senior Matthew Staley died. He had 
been involved in all sorts of activities, ranging from the school 
plays to the Art Club and even to this yearbook. He attended 
many school functions and a school trip to Canada, and was 
widely known as someone who knew how to have fun and to 
make others laugh. His presence has been greatly missed.

A Year of Changes 


Breaking Down the Wall 

The Berlin Wall, a symbol of East-West tensions since it was first 
raised by the East Germans in August, 1961, was dismantled as part of a 
New Year’s celebration of political reform. Earlier, in October, long time 
East German Communist Party leader Erich Honecker had been re- 
moved and then replaced by younger, more progressive Egron Krenz. 
Upon assuming office, Krenz reiterated a comment made earlier by 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev: “We have to react to the times, 
otherwise life will punish us.” 


Webster Case Boosts Pro-life Cause 

The U.S. Supreme Court, in a sharply divided 5-4 decision announced 
in July, put new restraints on a woman’s right to have an abortion. In the 
case of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Court upheld a 
Missouri law barring public employees from performing abortions unless 
the mother’s life was endangered and forbidding abortions in public 
buildings. Pro-lifers regained hope in their fight to overturn the 1973 
Roe v. Wade decision. 


Freedom in the Eastern Bloc and Baltic States 

Poland, Hungary, and Rumania are among the Eastern European 
nations that have experienced revolutionary change. Under the guidance 
of Lech Walesa and others, a new Solidarity dominated government was 
formed in September, 1989, in Poland. Hungary underwent consti- 
tutional reform and, having cut down the barbed wire fence on its border 
with Austria, became a major passageway for East Germans fleeing to 
the West. Rumanian leader Nikolai Ceaucescu, along with his wife, was 
executed and his Communist government supplanted with a republican 
one. 

Strong independence movements began in the Baltic States as well. 
Lithuanians declared independence from the Soviet Union despite So- 
viet threats. Soviets retaliated by cutting off supplies of energy sources. 
The Soviets were cautious yet not unresponsive to calls for reform in 
Latvia and Estonia.

Powerful Earthquake Hits California 

The second worst earthquake in U.S. history, exceeded 
only by the 1906 San Francisco quake, struck the San 
Francisco Bay area on October 17, 1989. The quake reg- 
istered 6.9 on the Richter scale, lasted for 1 5 seconds, and 
claimed at least 3,000 casualties, 59 of which were deaths. 
At least 38 people were killed when the quake caused the 
collapse of the upper level of the two-tiered Nimitz freeway 
onto the lower half. Physical damage was estimated at well 
over $ 1 billion. 


Change in South Africa 

In August, President P.W. Botha resigned as President of South Africa 
after a bitter political confrontation. Later, eight prominent black na- 
tionalists, seven of whom were affiliated with the African National 
Congress, were released from prison after having served many years. 
They called for the release of black nationalist leader Nelson Mandella. 
Several weeks later, Mandella was finally given his freedom by the South 
African government. 


Noriega Falls 

After one failed coup attempt in October, the Panamanian gov- 
ernment, led by General Manuel Noriega, was finally toppled with U.S. 
support. Noriega, under indictment in the U.S. for drug trafficking, 
attempted to evade U.S. law enforcers by seeking asylum with the 
Catholic Church. After much pressuring, however, Noriega left his place 
of asylum and was taken into custody by U.S. officals. 


Dalai Lama Gets the Prize 

The Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee announced in 
October that it had awarded its Peace Prize to the Dalai 
Lama, age 54, the exiled religious and political leader of 
Tibet. For nearly 40 years he had symbolized the resistance 
of the people of Tibet to rule by the Chinese, who had 
dominated Tibet since the 1950’s. 

Bicentennial Summit 

The leaders of the seven major noncommunist nations of 
the world convened for their annual summit in Paris, 
where they celebrated the 200th anniversary of the storm- 
ing of the Bastille on July 14th. Thirty-three heads of 
government were present as more than one million people 
crowded the Champs-Elysees for a parade. The summit 
leaders endorsed aid to reforming Eastern European na- 
tions and called for a new emphasis on the protection of the 
environment.

Earthquake Interrupts World Series 

Even the hugely popular World Series can take a back seat to nature. 
In this case, the third game between the San Francisco Giants and the 
Oakland Athletics was canceled after a major earthquake struck the area 
minutes before the game. Seeing no reason to cancel the series altogether, 
however, the teams decided to reschedule the game. 


LeMond Pulls Ahead 

American cyclist Greg LeMond, who became the first American to 
ever win the Tour de France bicycle race in 1986, came from being 50 
seconds behind to win again in 1989. Those who witnessed it said the 
finish was spectacular. 

Rose Banned 

Pete Rose, a baseball legend, was banned for life from the game after a 
report was issued stating that Rose had illegally been involved in gam- 
bling. Rose reportedly bet on games, including those of the team he 
managed, the Cincinnati Reds. During his playing career, Rose made 
more base hits than any other player in the history of the game. He was 
considered a Cincinnati hero. 


20th Anniversary of Earth Day Observed 

Americans of 1990 stopped to remember the importance 
of environmental issues on April 22, twenty years after the 
Americans of 1970 first declared that date “Earth Day.” 
The day was marked by parades, television specials, and 
rallies across the country. 

AIDS Epidemic Continues 

According to government health officials, over 40,000 
Americans have full-fledged AIDS and another 1 00,000 to 
200,000 are infected with the virus and have mild symp- 
toms. A search for a cure continues as the disease spirals 
toward epidemic proportions. 


Jordan a Hero 

In a poll representing a cross of high school students across the United 
States, Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan was selected as the individual 
in public life that they admired most. Jordan, who is known for his clean- 
cut and charitable off-court image as well as his stellar on-court per- 
formance, seems a logical choice. 


Skateboard Craze Resurfaces 

A new genre of personality appeared in full force this 
year: the “skater.” Skateboards, which have been “out” 
since the seventies, have made a comeback in a big way. 
Skaters are known for their characteristic style of dress, 
haircut, and speech.

Balance is that steady 
middle ground that is so dif- 
ficult to find. It is the result 
of careful, measured steps, 
of keeping all priorities 
smoothly arranged. 

Every year, however, adds 
new ideas which threaten to 
topple the existing balance. 
New priorities are created 
which must find a place 
among the older ones. Main- 
taining balance, then, is not 
a static process but a dy- 
namic one. 

Every student at Andrean 
faces the challenge of keep- 
ing a balance. Where the 
people and the events de- 
picted in this book will fit 
into the balance of a stu- 
dent’s life is for each stu- 
dent to decide. The experi- 
ence of high school, though, 
must not be overlooked as 
part of a transition to a 
wider world and as part of a 
balanced life.
