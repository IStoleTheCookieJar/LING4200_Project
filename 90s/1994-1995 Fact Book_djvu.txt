Preface 


Many  questions  are  frequently  asked  of  the  personnel  in  the  Office  of  institutional  Research 
about  student  enrollments  and  student  characteristics,  faculty,  academic  disciplines,  and  numerous 
other  subjects,  with  reference  both  to  the  present  and  the  past,  some  people  simply  need  an 
enrollment  figure  while  others  might  require  a  more  in-depth  analysis  of  data  over  a  period  of  time, 
while  still  others  might  need  an  entire  research  report. 

The  purpose  of  this  FACTBOOK  is  to  provide  a  ready  source  of  current  and  trend  information. 
It  is  not  meant  to  provide  a  complete  history  of  Salisbury  state  university,  but  to  provide  a  picture 
of  Salisbury  state  University  as  it  is  today,  with  reference  to  the  past  five  and  in  some  cases  the  past 
ten  years.  Factbooks  have  been  produced  by  the  institutional  Research  Office  since  the  1983-84 
academic  year.  This  year's  edition  contains  data  up  to  and  including  the  Fall  1994  semester;  data 
about  the  Spring  1995  semester  will  be  distributed  in  about  mid-April. 

I  hope  many  of  your  questions  will  be  answered  in  this  FACTBOOK.  If  you  require  additional 
information,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  call  this  office,  suggestions  for  improvement  in  the 
presentation  of  the  data  are  welcome.

University  Environment 


Salisbury  state  University  is  located  in  Salisbury,  Maryland,  centrally  located  on  the  Eastern 
Shore  of  Maryland.  The  Eastern  Shore  of  Maryland  is  that  part  of  the  Delmarva  Peninsula  in 
Maryland  between  the  Chesapeake  Bay  on  the  west  and  the  Atlantic  ocean  on  the  east.  The 
state  of  Delaware  borders  the  region  and  a  portion  of  the  state  of  Virginia  lies  to  the  south. 

First  explored  by  Captain  John  Smith,  the  Shore  retains  much  of  its  historical  charm  and 
natural  beauty.  Because  of  its  miles  of  shoreline  and  many  rivers,  the  Eastern  Shore  has 
become  known  for  its  recreational  offerings.  Tourism  and  both  recreational  and  commercial 
fishing,  although  diminished  in  recent  years,  have  been  important  sources  of  income. 
Agriculture  has  remained  an  important  industry  since  settlers  first  landed  in  the  early  1600‘s. 
The  Atlantic  beaches,  relatively  mild  winter  temperatures,  and  relaxed  lifestyle  attract  both 
summer  vacationers  and  permanent  residents.  As  the  population  has  increased  and  the 
economy  diversified,  more  persons  have  become  employed  in  manufacturing,  wholesale  and 
retail  trade,  and  professional  services.  According  to  a  1990  Maryland  Office  of  Planning 
estimate,  the  total  population  of  the  Eastern  Shore,  consisting  of  nine  Maryland  counties, 
was  351,050.  This  figure  represents  an  18.4%  increase  from  the  1980  census  (296,620).  The 
population  is  projected  to  increase  another  10%  by  the  year  2000. 

Salisbury,  which  is  the  cultural  and  economic  hub  of  the  Eastern  Shore,  is  its  largest  city  with 
a  metropolitan  population  of  60,000.  Located  at  the  crossroads  of  Routes  50  and  13  and 
along  the  Wicomico  River,  Salisbury  is  the  county  seat  for  Wicomico  County  and  a  major 
distribution  point  for  supplies  and  materials  to  the  rest  of  the  area,  unknown  to  many, 
Salisbury  is  the  busiest  port  in  Maryland  after  Baltimore.  Its  Salisbury-Wicomico  Airport  is  also 
the  state's  busiest  after  Baltimore-Washington  International.  Manufacturing  and  processing 
industries  employ  the  largest  number  of  residents,  but  both  wholesale  and  retail  firms  and 
service  industries  are  important  components  of  the  community's  economy. 

Salisbury  is  located  115  miles  east  of  Washington,  D.C.,  125  miles  south  of  Philadelphia,  and 
30  miles  west  of  Ocean  City,  Maryland,  which  swells  to  a  population  of  300,000  during  the 
summer  months.  The  1990  population  of  Wicomico  County  is  74,900,  an  increase  of  38% 
from  1970.  The  population  is  expected  to  increase  another  9.5%  by  the  year  2000. 

Along  with  its  economic  importance,  Salisbury  offers  many  social  and  cultural  opportunities. 
Its  newspapers,  television  and  radio  stations,  movie  theaters,  stores,  businesses  and 
industries,  museums,  libraries,  civic  center,  cultural  programs,  houses  of  worship,  public  and 
private  schools,  and  community  college  and  university  all  contribute  to  an  on-going  vitality 
and  significance  in  the  life  of  the  peninsula,  and  Maryland. 

Wor-Wic  Community  College,  once  a  "college  without  walls,"  has  moved  to  a  spacious  new 
campus  on  the  eastern  outskirts  of  Salisbury.  The  university  of  Maryland,  Eastern  Shore 
(UMES),  is  located  12  miles  to  the  south  in  Princess  Anne,  Maryland,  and  is  a  regional  sister 
institution  within  the  University  of  Maryland  System.  Salisbury  State  and  UMES  have  been 
working  together  to  expand  educational  programming  opportunities  for  students.

History  of  the  university 


in  1922,  the  Maryland  State  Legislature  established  a  commission  to  determine  a  location  for 
a  two-year  normal  school  on  the  Eastern  Shore  of  Maryland.  A  site  at  Salisbury  was  selected 
by  the  commission  and  the  institution  was  opened  in  September,  1925. 

The  school  offered  a  two-year  course  for  the  preparation  of  elementary  school  teachers  until 
1931  when  the  program  was  expanded  to  three  years,  in  1934,  the  course  of  studies  was 
again  expanded  to  four  years  and  in  1935,  by  action  of  the  Legislature,  the  University  was 
authorized  to  grant  the  bachelor  of  science  degree  and  to  change  its  name  to  the  state 
Teachers  College  at  Salisbury. 

in  1947,  expansion  of  the  teacher  preparation  program  occurred  to  include  the  junior  high 
school  level.  In  i960,  the  program  was  expanded  to  include  teacher  preparation  for  the 
senior  high  school  level  and  the  establishment  of  a  four-year  program  in  the  arts  and 
sciences,  with  majors  in  several  academic  fields,  leading  to  the  bachelor  of  arts  and  the 
bachelor  of  science  degrees,  in  1962,  the  state  Board  of  Trustees  approved  a  graduate 
program  leading  to  the  master  of  education  degree. 

By  legislative  action,  the  five  state  teachers  colleges  in  Maryland  became  state  colleges  in 
1963,  with  the  word  "teachers"  deleted  from  the  name,  and  a  new  board  of  trustees  was 
established  known  as  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  state  Colleges.  Under  the  jurisdiction  of 
this  governing  board,  the  major  emphasis  was  placed  on  the  development  of  the  university's 
undergraduate  program,  with  majors  in  the  arts  and  sciences  as  well  as  professional 
preparation  leading  to  teacher  certification. 

Since  1963,  the  university  has  expanded  rapidly  and  presently  offers  29  undergraduate 
majors  including  professional  programs  in  business  administration,  social  work,  medical 
technology,  and  nursing,  in  addition  to  curricula  in  education  and  the  arts  and  sciences.  In 
1971,  a  program  leading  to  the  master  of  arts  degree  in  history  was  approved;  in  1974,  a 
master  of  arts  degree  in  psychology  was  established.  Most  recently,  graduate  programs 
leading  to  a  master's  of  business  administration  and  a  master's  in  nursing  were  added  in 
1982. 

Through  legislation  effective  July  1, 1988,  Salisbury  State  along  with  five  other  institutions 
formerly  governed  by  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  State  Universities  and  colleges,  became 
a  part  of  the  university  of  Maryland  System,  on  the  same  date,  the  name  of  the  institution 
was  officially  changed  from  Salisbury  State  College  to  Salisbury  state  University,  through 
separate  legislative  action. 

Salisbury  State  university  is  the  largest  higher  education  institution  on  the  Eastern  Shore  of 
Maryland  with  a  fall  1994  headcount  enrollment  of  6048  students.  As  an  integral  part  of  the 
public  system  of  higher  education  in  the  state,  the  university  is  supported,  in  part,  by 
appropriations  authorized  by  the  state  Legislature.

The  university  Mission  statement 


Salisbury  State  University  is  a  comprehensive  institution  of  higher  learning  offering  a  traditional,  liberal 
arts  curriculum  and  a  variety  of  pre-professional  and  professional  programs  on  both  the  graduate  and 
undergraduate  levels.  The  following  Mission  Statement  approved  by  the  faculty  and  the  administration 
in  1984  expresses  the  ideals  which  underlie  the  service  of  the  university  to  its  students  and  to  the 
regional  and  state  community  of  which  it  is  a  part. 

1.  The  faculty  and  administration  of  Salisbury  State  University  accept  the  responsibility  to  foster  in  our 
students  an  ability  to  obtain,  understand  and  accurately  assess  information  and  ideas,  to  think 
reasonably  and  independently,  and  to  speak  and  write  intelligently  and  effectively. 

2.  in  order  to  give  focus  and  direction  to  the  students'  course  of  study,  the  university  is  committed 
to  introducing  students  to  a  system  of  ideas  about  the  nature  of  humanity,  the  universe,  and  the  world 
created  by  art  and  thought.  To  this  end,  the  University  offers  as  the  cornerstone  of  learning  an 
integrated  curriculum  which  examines  the  salient  ideas  in  the  humanities,  social  sciences,  natural 
sciences  and  mathematics.  This  curriculum  serves  students  both  as  the  foundation  for  specialized 
study  and  as  the  source  for  a  set  of  convictions  which  can  guide  the  conduct  of  their  lives. 

3.  Furthermore,  the  University  assumes  that  what  we  teach  and  how  we  teach  ought  to  foster  in  our 
students  a  disposition  for  responsible  conduct.  As  such,  we  are  committed  to  encouraging  attitudes 
of  integrity  and  fairness,  respect  for  others,  dedication  to  the  pursuit  of  truth,  and  the  willingness  to 
uphold  and  to  challenge  one's  own  convictions.  It  is  expected  that  these  attitudes  will  instill  in  our 
students  a  desire  to  do  things  well,  to  sustain  rather  than  disparage  high  principles,  and  to  participate 
as  informed,  committed  citizens  in  the  public  forum. 

4.  The  University  also  assumes  the  responsibility  to  prepare  students  to  work  confidently  and 
effectively  in  their  chosen  careers;  to  this  end  we  provide  practicable  counseling  and  a  number  of 
professional  and  technical  degree  programs.  Career  preparation  is  not  the  exclusive  province  of  such 
programs,  however;  certain  attributes-the  power  to  think  clearly,  judge  soundly,  and  communicate 
effectively,  the  ability  to  interact  with  people  in  a  productive  and  considerate  way,  and  the  capacity 
to  adapt  and  learn  in  new  and  unfamiliar  situations-must  be  learned  in  all  courses.  And,  most 
important,  we  attempt  to  instill  in  our  graduates  a  spirit  of  dedication  to  their  vocations  and  a  sense 
of  service  to  society. 

5.  The  University  is  also  committed  to  graduate  study  beyond  the  baccalaureate  level.  To  help 
graduate  students  enrich  and  extend  their  knowledge  and  competence  in  their  respective  fields  of 
study,  the  University  encourages  them  to  embrace  an  ethos  dedicated  to  the  continuing  acquisition 
of  knowledge  and  the  pursuit  of  the  intellectual  ideal,  we  expect  those  engaged  in  graduate  study  to 
commit  themselves  to  excellence  through  the  consistent  exercise  of  coherent  thought,  sound 
judgement  and  effective  communication. 

6.  The  University  recognizes  that  the  students  have  needs  and  interests  that  go  beyond  the  scope  of 
academic  life,  and  we  therefore  provide  additional  services  and  sponsor  extra-curricular  and  co- 
curricular  activities  which  are  consistent  with  the  goals  and  purposes  of  the  institution,  services  that 
support  the  physical  and  mental  health  of  the  students,  and  activities  such  as  student  government, 
athletics  and  cultural  events  that  enhance  their  lives,  are  sponsored  by  the  University  as  necessary 
components  of  the  education  of  the  whole  person. 

7.  Finally,  we  recognize  the  important  contribution  that  the  university  and  our  faculty  make  to  the 
local  region,  and  therefore  provide  to  the  surrounding  community  when  and  where  feasible,  the 
cultural,  social  and  professional  resources  of  the  university. 

NOTE:  An  officially  recognized  five-page  amplification  of  the  mission  statement  is  available  from  the 
Office  of  institutional  Research.

Salisbury  State  university 
Student  Right  to  Know  Statement 


The  federal  Student  Right  to  Know  and  Campus  Security  Act  of  1990  (Public  Law  102-26, 1991)  specifies  that 
all  colleges  and  universities  disclose  annually  the  graduation  rates  of  degree-seeking  undergraduate 
students  after  150%  of  normal  time.  Salisbury  State  University  is  a  4-year  institution,  therefore  150% 
normal  time  is  a  6-year  graduation  rate.  The  group,  or  cohort,  that  is  traced  over  this  6  year  time  period 
is  established  each  fall  and  includes  only  first-time,  full-time,  degree-seeking  freshmen,  see  the  table  below 
for  six-year  graduation  rates  of  ssu  freshmen  from  SSU,  and  from  other  institutions  within  the  University 
of  Maryland  System,  complete  information  on  this  topic  is  available  from  the  institutional  Research  Office. 

I  Reporting  period  July  1, 1991  to  June  30, 1992 

(Report  due  July  1, 1993) 

The  graduation  rate  of  SSU  first-time,  full-time  freshmen  who  entered  in  the  Fall 
1986  semester  and  graduated  by  June  30, 1992  was  48.0% 

SSU's  rate  compares  favorably  to  a  national  average  of  43%  for  public  four  year  institutions  as  reported  in  the 
introduction  to  the  legislation.  It  also  compares  favorably  to  the  40.6%  average  six-year  graduation  rate  (for  the 
Fall  1986  cohort)  as  reported  in  the  1993  American  Association  of  state  colleges  &  u  n  i  vers  i  ti  es/sa  1 1  ie  Mae  Retention 
survey.  (This  aggregate  data  is  limited  by  the  fact  that  only  31%  of  the  AASCU  institutions  responded). 


Reporting  period  July  1, 1992  to  June  30, 1993 


(Report  due  July  1 , 1 994) 

The  graduation  rate  of  SSU  first-time,  full-time  freshmen  who  entered  in  the  Fall  1987 
semester  and  graduated  by  June  30, 1993  was  55.4%. 


Reporting  period  July  1, 1993  to  June  30, 1994 


(Report  due  July  1, 1995) 

The  graduation  rate  of  SSU  first-time,  full-time  freshmen  who  entered  in  the  Fall  1988 
semester  and  graduated  by  June  30, 1994  was  53.9%.

SUBJECT:  SSU’s  Enrollment  Data.  Fall  1995 


Since  the  SSU  FACTBOOK  for  1995-96  will  not  be  ready  for  distribution  until  later 
this  fall,  I  thought  I’d  send  to  you  now  eight  tables  containing  our  most  heavily  requested 
enrollment  data,  which  have  been  updated  with  our  official  Fall  1995  figures. 

Our  Fall  1995  total  headcount  is  6010,  which  is  a  .6%  drop  from  last  fall’s 
enrollment  of  6048.  Our  Full-Time  Equivalency  of  Students  (FTES)  is  4962. 

I’ve  also  included  information  on  the  number  of  degrees  including  degrees  awarded  to 
double  majors  over  the  last  five  years. 


If  you  have  any  questions  or  other  information  needs,  please  give  me  a  call.

MEMO  TO:  Dr.  Bellavance,  the  Provost,  the  Vice-Presidents,  Deans, 
Department  Chairs  and  other  Department  Heads 

FROM:  Linda  A.  cashman  [T  / 

Director  of  lnstitutiof%U?£search 

SUBJECT:  SSU  FACT  BOOK  1994-95 


The  ssu  fact  book  has  been  updated  for  the  1994-95  academic  year,  and  rve 
enclosed  a  copy  which  I  hope  will  be  useful  to  you  as  a  reference  document  and  a  quick 
source  for  institutional  data.  As  you  may  be  aware,  the  fact  book  covers  a  wide  variety  of 
information  from  freshmen  SAT  score  averages  to  the  number  of  degrees  awarded  in  each 
discipline  and  the  percentage  of  tenured  faculty  by  rank  and  department. 

The  last  section  of  the  fact  book  entitled  "Academic  Program  Review  support,"  is 
designed  to  be  used  by  those  programs  undergoing  UMS  Academic  Program  Review,  namely 
the  English,  Medical  Technology,  Nursing  and  Psychology  programs.  This  section  contains 
required  data  on  student  credit  hours,  degrees  awarded  and  enrollment  breakdowns  by 
class,  age,  ethnicity,  sex  and  residency. 

Let  me  me  know  of  any  kind  of  information  you  need  which  does  not  appear  in  the 
FACT  book,  certainly  1  welcome  your  suggestions  for  improving  or  correcting  any  part  of 
it.  If  you  have  any  questions,  please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  me. 

Finally,  feel  free  to  circulate  your  copy  among  faculty  and  staff  in  your  department. 
I’ve  discovered  that  many  faculty  and  staff  find  the  fact  book  useful  in  completing 
committee  and  departmental  assignments.  I  regret  my  budget  allows  for  the  production  of 
only  a  limited  number  of  copies.
